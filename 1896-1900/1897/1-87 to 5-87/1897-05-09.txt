CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, May B.â
The Sun correspondent learns that Edhem
Pasha has telegraphed to the Porte that
the British and French Consuls at Volo,
accompanied by sailors bearing their
national flags, came to Velestino and in
formed him that the Greeks werÂ« evac
uating the city, after having released the
convicts. They added that sailors from
foreign warships had been landed to pro
visionally protect the property of Consul!*,
but speedy protection was needed to save
the city from lire and pillage. Edhem
Pasha adds that he accordingly dis
patched 8000 men, who occupied the town
and outskirts.
Earlier Edhem Pasha telegraphed that
after a bloody battle with 15,000 Greeks he
captured Velestino, and would advance
to-day to Volo, whith?r the Greek army
fled after leaving Velestino.
The Sultan has telegraphed to the mili
tary authorities in Asia Minor, ordering
eleven regiments of Hamdich cavalry sent
to the front immediately, and transport
-?t'arriej ., have been dispatched to the
Black rica to convey the troops to the
Greek coast.
Official bulletins have been issued an- i
nouncing the capture of Pharsala, where
the Turks seized large quantities of pro
visions and ammunition,
A panic occurred in the Galata quarter
yesterday, growing out of a fear that the
remaining Greeks would be massacred.
The police used the butts of their rifles
upon the heads of sympathetic crowds of
Greets, wno gathered on the quay watch
ing the departure of a steamer with
hundreds of Greeks on board, and many
of them were severely injured. The
charge of the police appeared wholly un
provoked. The police announce they
have received a warning that two
Christian Cretans have arrived with the
intention of assassinating the German and
1 Kussian Embasbadors. The story is
doubtless untrue, but will serve as a cloak
; for further brutality toward Christians
under the guise 01 protecting Ambassa
dors.
ATHENS, Greece. May B.â Edhem
Pasha has promised the foreign Consuls
' who went from Volo to Velestino to con
. fer with him that he will respect life and
"property at Vo'.o if the commander of thÂ«
! Greek squadron of that place will agree
-, not to fire at his army after its occupation
. of the town, and as a guarantee of his in
| tention to keep this agreement he will
I withdraw his fleet. The proposition on
I the part of Edhem Pasha has been ac
j cepted by the Greek commander. The
| entire Greek army in Thessaly will be
i concentrated at Dhomoko.
LONDON, Eng., May Dispatches re
ceived here this afternoon say the foreign
I warships landed sailors and marines at
, Volo in accordance with the request of
the British, French and Italian consuls,
â¢who asked that men be sent ashore to pro
tect the town. The assurance is given
â¢ that the Turkish occupation of Volo
will be absolutely peaceful and perfect
- order maintained.
A dispatch from Athens to the Central
News says that Greece notified the powers
she would recall the officers and sappers
from Crete and promised gradually to
â¢'. withdraw all troops from the island. The
powers thereupon offered to mediate be
tween her and Turkey on condition that
Greece should unreservedly confide her
interests to the powers.
Greece, the dispatch adds, objects to
this condition. Other dispatches from
Athens in the main confirm the dispatch
to the Central News.- It is doubtful, how
ever, whether the powers have yet offered
to mediate. Pourparlers are proceeding
with reference to conditions, but effective
mediation is not regarded as immediate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
VIEW OF HALMYROS AND ITS SKALA OR PORT, Whither General
Smolenski Retired From Velestino.
The town of Halmyros is situated on the southwestern edge of a plain called by the same name, about ten miles long by four wide, whichskirts the western side of the
Gulf of Volo. The present town occupies the site of a city of much renown in ancient times, and parts of many of the buildings now standing are centuries old. About three
miles east of the town, at the mouth of a small river which comes down from the foothills of Gera-Kovani and across the plain, is its skala, or landing-place, Halmyros having
from early times a good deal of trade by sea with lower Greece. The mountains to the west and south of the plain belong to spurs of the Great Orthrys range. The
view is from the extremity of Cape Halmyro, on the eastern side of a bay of the same name and directly east of the skala. General Smolenski's position is not only a strong
one naturally but gives him the assistance of the war vessels in the gulf.

CAUTIOUS HAROLD SEWALL.
The New Minister to Hawaii Positively
Declines to Discuss the Affairs
of the Islands.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 8.-Harold
Sewall, the new Minister to the Hawaiian
Islands, was seen by a" Call representa
tive at the Metropolitan Club to-night.
Mr. Bewail wa9 shown a dispatch from San
Francisco in which he was reported as
saying that the administration was very
much disturbed and perplexed about re
ports of Japan's intention of ultimately
occupying Hawaii, and that the rapid set
tlement of the Hawaiian Islands by Jap
anese was a part of this programme.
Minister Sewall said to The Call corre
spondent: "I do not care to discuss this
matter. Of course you will readily un
derstand why it would be improper for
me, as a diplomatic representative, to ei
jress my views or to repeal whatever 1
may have heard from the State Depart
ment. You may say, however, thai since
my appointment 1 have studiously en
deavored to avoid meeting newspaper
men, and you are the first I have 3een. I
have no prejudice against newspaper cor
respondents, but what one says is so often
distorted.
"If a recently appointed diplomatic
agent of the United States wants to keep
out of trouble he had better keep his
mouth closed. I have adhered to this and
any reports quoting me or pretending to
give my views are manufactured."
Mr. Sewall says he has not yet received
any instructions as to the exact time he
will leave for the islands, although he had
a long talk recently with President Me-
Kinley. He will go direct from here to
San Francisco, having closed up his busi
ness affairs in Maine.
HAWAII AND JAPAN.
No Anxiety Is Felt ,n Either Country Ovsr

Offices Courted.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May. aâ The
Star says: A telegram was received here
to-day from Tacoma, Wash., saying:
The Kor them Pacific t learner Pelican, from
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 9, 1897-THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
the Orient, brings advices that Count Okuma,
the Japanese Minister at Washington, has
been instructed to dispatch the American
adviser of the Japanese legation in tne United
Statos, D. W. Stevens, to Hawaii at once aid
in settling the Hawaiian trouble. It is ex
pected that Mr. Stcvehs and Counselor
Akyami, sent from the Foreign Offico atToklo,
will assist Mr. Shimaru, the Japanese repre
sentative at Honolulu, in conducting negotia
tions with the Hawaiian Government.
A Star reporter, who visited the Japa
nese legation here to-day, was informed
that Mr. Stevens, counselor of the lega
tion, was not going to Hawaii, as indi
cated in the above dispatch. It appears
that when trouble seemed imminent a
short time ago the Japanese authorities
instructed Minister Hoshi to have Mr.
Stevens proceed to Hawaii. Subsequently,
however, the situation became more
pacific and Mr. Stevens' trip was aban
doned as unnecessary.
Recent advices to the legation show that
the Japanese Government, as well as the
people of that country, is in no way agi
tated over the Hawaiian situation. The
Japanese Government has put a stop to
all emigration to Hawaii. It is also
stated that the dispatch of a Japanese
warship to Honolulu was in no sense a
menace, but was intended simply to re
strain any possible demonstration by the
Japanese there, in consequence of the ex
clusion of Japanese immigrants.
In this connection it is said that an
offer by the United States to use its good
cilices in securing a settlement of the
trouble would doubtless be accepted by
Japan. ' â¢'â "r

Had Klngr George and the Sultan
Been Let Alone There Would
Not Have Been War.
[Copyrighted, 1897, by the New York Snn.]
LONDON, Ekg. ( May 8. â The week
ends, in the language of John Morley,
with the "Sultan laughing, Greece bleed
ing and the Prime Minister making a jest
of it." Morley insists further that every
victory of the Turk is a European disas
ter. That is one view. The other and
more general is that disaster to Greece
insures harmony among the powers and
the peace of Europe. The fact is business
is improving, the stock markets are be- |
coming buoyant, and the interest which
the great mass of Europeans take in the
GiSDeo-Turkish war, at first keeuiy appre
hensive, is now purely spectacular.
It would be easy, politically speaking,
to present a rosy outlook as the result of
recent events Jn the East and in certain
imperial capitals. It would not be difficult
also to paint a gloomy picture of the same
situation. One or two uncertainties are
being gradually eliminated, but the veil
still hides other essential features. It is
becoming evident, in spite of all the re
ports to the contrary, that Greece, official
and populace, will be glad to make peace
on any reasonable terms. The indications
are also that the powers are unanimously
in favor of the same end.
Regarding the Sultan, however, there is
a conflict of evidence. The Sun's corre
spondent at Stamboul reports to-night
tnat the Porte nominally favors peace,
but is pushing fresh war measures with
the utmost vigor. There is no doubt
when the question of terms is raised the
Sultan's demands will be exorbitant â so
extreme, indeed, that Greece will say, as
now reported in Athens, she will prefer
wax to extermination to accepting. But
there is vastly more than appears on the
surface of tbe situation. Some facts of
great significance are beginning to appear
[in connection with the discussion of re
sponsibility for the beginning of the war.
Canon Mac Coll, wno is one of the fore
most Greek sympathizers in England, has
just returned from Athens. Â±Ie quotes
the highest authority in the kingdom for
saying that all Greece hoped or wished
was to be left fare to face with the Porte,
which made overtures direct to the Greek
Government un the Cretan question, but
was stopped by tho intervention of one of
'â  the powers. How far the concert col
' lectively was aware of this fact was not
known, but of the fact itself there is no
douDt. From the day the Greek troops
were allowed to land in Crete war was in
evitable unless one of two conditions was
granted â either permission to Greece and
the Porte to deal airectly or some con
cession to the amour propre of Greece.
To have retired unconditionally would
have meant not only the defeat of the
ministry, but also the downfall of the
j monarchy, to be followed by a revolution
more menacing to the peace of Europe
than the present situation.
This without doubt is true enough as
far as it goes, but King George recently
affirmed he could have had Crete a year
ago it' he had consented to give Suda .Bay
to a certain power. Couole this with the
declaration of Captain Gambier in the
current number of the Fortnightly Re
view: "I happen to know M. Melidoff
came very near persuading the Sultan a
few weeks ago to hand over tue pacilica
tion and eventual povernment of Crete to
Russia alone. While this perfectly sensi
ble arrangement was being negotiated, M.
Campbon, the strongest and ablest diplo
matist in Constantinople, got wind of it.
He called on NeJidoff and proposed a
j counter scheme tti.it fj Russia was placed
in this position Francs be permitted to
occupy Smyrna or Beyrout. England
was left entirely out of the whole affair,
and there is not a shadow of doubt nad
not tbe calculations of these two men
been upset by the incalculable nower
which lurks in stupidity, sucu as is now
being exhibited by King George, the ar
rangements would have been carried out.
It is known England could not fire a shot
to prevent it."
There are still other elements of this
â mister situation which complicate it,
making tho outcome far more uncertain
than casual observers fondly believe.
Greece is disgraced and crushed perhaps,
but still a factor to be reckoned with, bo,
too, are the. Cretans, who have been al
most ignored since the more serious war
began. Recent dispatcher from Candia
say that the Turks have resumed their ex
cessive confidence that autonomy i> a
dead letter. This would easily seem to be
a point for the restoration of Turkish rule,
for no step haÂ» been taken to withdraw a
single Turkish solder. It is unfortunate
that such color is lent to the insurgents'
persistent assertion that the powers are
allied with Turkey. Food is becoming
exhausted, ana desperation wiU result.
Chiefs in Akrotiri are unshaken by tne
disasters in Greece. They prefer her
ruined to Europe or autonomy. They
would send a force of volunteers to Greece,
if allowed to do so. They give no sipn of
yielding. They are more determined and
less conciliatory than ever. Europe must
not expect any easier solution as a result
of the war in Greece. Above and domi
nating all these camplications is the re
grouping of the powers by themselves,
which is not yet clearly defined beyond a
revival of the league of the three em
perors. Salisbury may be terribly de
ceived, but tnere is no Joubt he n confi
dent of the practical friendship of France,
as well as Italy.
There is a remarkable article in the
Paris Matin th.a week signed "Y.," which
is openly ascribed to Hanotaux, and the
assertion is not denied. It contains these
significant sentences: "A great danger in
the Balkans was the possibility of & col
lision between Austria and Russia. That
is now over, as Emperor Francis Joseph
and the Czar have realized the great idea
of Catherine I and Nicholas i as to the
understanding between Austria and Rus
sia in the presence of the Turk. But this
understanding has taken place within a
European concert and does not affect the
respective alliances of the two countries.
Of course if there were an alliance be
tween the three Emperors this would
mean an end of the Franco-Russian union.
But the understanding between the repub
lic and the Muscovite empire is more
cordial than ever. It in neiiher an ex
clusive nor a jealous arrangement. The
two couniries are absolutely pacihc, and
wish to establish general confidence and
solidity in Europe."
This may be interpreted as a warning
to the Czar not to ally himself with Em
peror William or an indorsement of the
Austro-Russian understanding.

PARIS, France, May B.â The identity
of the plumber who heroically rescued
several persons from the fire on Tuesday
was not known until yesterday, when he
was found running through Rue
de Marbourg, raving mad, and shoutinp
"Fire." He was taken to a police sta
tion, where, aiter being quieted down,
he was able to give his name, which he
said was Leiou Desjardins. He also gave
his age as 31 and said he was out of em
ployment and had no home.
Desjardins said he had been looking for
work for some weeks and was in quest of
employment when he happened to pass
the burning building just after the fire
started.
In his efforts to save the lives of others
he was severely hurt, ana his injuries, to
gether with the exposure and hunger to
which he had been subjected, unbalanced
his mind. The doctors who examined
him believe with proper rest and food,
both of which have been provided, he will
recover, and arrangements have already
been made to giv? him permanent work.
All the preparations for the celebrations
of requiem mass in the Cathedral of
Notre Dame to-day for the repose of the
sonla of the tire victims were completed
last night. Tne main entrance to the edi

CHICAGO, 111., May B.â Financial cir
cles were startled to-day by'tne news that
C. K. Beach, the capitalist, bad shot him
self. The only possible reason to be as
signed for the deed is that for some time
past Beach has been in poor health. He
has not complained about reverses in liis
affairs. He had a poor constitution and a
melancholy disposition. He would re
main in a morbid state of despondency for
days, and whenever his friends would try
and tret him in a cheerful humor he would
leave them abruptly and absolutely refuse
their sood offices.
Some years ago Beach wag a power in
finance, but because of his poor health he
retired from an active participation in the
moneyed circle*. He is reputed to be very
wealthy, but no one knows definitely just
v.hat he is worth. He was a very secretive
man ab nt his property, and did business
through many agents.

MAJOR-GENERAL
WHEATON RETIRES
An Interesting Situation
Occasioned by the
Vacancy.
Three Brigadiers May Possibly
Be Promoted in Con
sequence.
This Would Open the Way for
Advancement AH Along
the Line.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 8.-Major-
General Wheaion, commanding the
Department of Colorado, was placed on
the retired list of the army to-day on
account of age.
Colonel William If. Graham, Fifth
Artillery, formerly stationed at the Pre
sidio, but now at Fort Hamilton, N. V.,
is in Washington, and had an interview
with Senator Perkins to-night. He is
anxious to be a brigadier-general.
The contest lor the com;ng vacancies in
the grade of major-general and brigadier
general, has become exceedingly lively.
Asked who would succeed Mnjor-General
Wheaton, Secretary Alger replied: "Briea.
dier-General Brooke, in ail probability."
A considerable majority of the officers
of the army on duty at toe War Depart
ment are of the opinion that General
Brooke will be appointed. There are a
lew, however, who believe that General
Forsyth wili be the fortunate man. That
an effort is being made to secure this
officer's selection thnre is no doubt.
Whether it will be successful remains to
be seen.
The report was current at the War De
partment yesterday afternoon, and some
of the best-informed officers said it seemed
to bÂ« well founded, that the President is
seriously consideering the advisability of
advancing General Forsyth with the un
derstanding that he will immediately re
tire, i
Another report has it that the President
is also thinking of promoting General
B'.i'S when General Forsyth retires. The
latter officer will retire on account of ace
in August, 1898, and the former would
leave the active list April 17, 1899. Gen
eral Brooke does not retire until July 21,
1902. It is a fact that some of the friends
of General Brooke are somewhat appre
hensive at the prospects. They have tele
eraphed the general to come to Washing
ton immediately, and his early arrival is
expected. From what is said at the War
Department Secretary Aleer favors the
promotion of General Brooke. Nothing
definite can be iearned as to President
McKinley's preference.
Spould it be true that he intends to ad
vance Generals Forsytb and Bliss in suc
cession on condition that these officers
retire immediately afterward and that
General Brooke wou!a then Ie advanced
he would have at his disposal the ap
pointment o: three ninjor-giuierala in the
army at once. This is most unusual, but
that is not all; each major-general ap
pointed means a vacancy in the grade of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
brigadier-general. Therefore the Presi
dent can, if he chooses, appoint in the
next few days not only three major
generals but three brigadier-generals. It
is an interesting fact that Senator Mark
Hanna is working In the interests of Gen
eral Forsytii.
Of the colonels who may become brig
adier-generals in tbe event of the three
vacancies occurring the names of Colonels
Anderson, Mizner and Frank are now
most prominently mentioned. The friends
of these officers are legion, it is said, at the
War Department. Many other coloiu-ls
who are aspirants for the single star are
not without friends in social and political
life, who are doing all in their power for
their favorites, but their adherents seem,
at least, to be less numerous.
If General Brooke is promoted the guess
at the W T ar Department is that Colonel
Anderson will be selected. He is not the
senior line colonel, but he retires in Jan
uary, 1900. nearly a year betore tbe senior
colonel, Merriam. Colonel Poland's name
is also spoken of quite favorably at the
War Department. The names of at least
a dozen colonels and tueir records have
been considered.
Secretary Al ser said to a representative
of The Call late yesterday afternoon that
the question of the selection of a major
general and a brigadier was discussed at
the Cabinet meeting, but that no conclu
sion was reached by the President.
Sergeant Lenyke Thomas', Piesidio of
San Francisco, will be discharged from
the service oi the United States by the
commanding officer of his station.
Captain Rogers Birnie, ordnance de
partment, will proceed to Benicia arsenal,
California, Fort Stevens, Oreeon, and
Seattle, Washington, on official business
under such instructions as he may receive
from the Chief of Ordnance, and upon the
completion thereof will return to his
station in this city.
GOSSIP IN AMM I CIRCLES.
Major Darling Way Be Sent to a More
Jrnpurtant Po*t I'hnn Brunei*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â The re
fusal of the President to detail Major John
A. Darling, Third Artillery, Presidio, of
San Francisco, as military attache at
Brussels has caused a good deal of gossip
in army circles here, as this refusal is ex
pected to have an important bearing on
the question of social precedence at the
Presidio.
The Army and Navy Register says: An
officer will be detailed for this dnty
shortly. The costs at London and Paris
were under consideration this week.
General Alger is in favor of having our
army represented at the different coun
tries abroad that are advanced in the
science of war. He will not only fill all
vacancies, but also increase the number.
The military information division, he ba
lieves, should not be so cramped as it has
been, but should be given every oppor
tunity to secure the valuable information
which can only be obtained by our having
a representative.
WHITE GETS NO SATISFACTION
Secretary A/ger Declines io Give the
Senator Any Promise With Regard
Io San Pedro Harbor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â Senator
White's interview with Secretary of War
Al^er about the improvement of Sari
Pedro harbor was not satisfactory to the
Senator, ard he plainly gave the Secre
tary to understand that lie would intro
duce in the Senate and urge the passage
of a resolution demanding trÂ». know what
steps (if any) had been taken by the Sec
retary of War to tarry out the act of Con
gress, and ii no steps had been taken to
give his reasons for delay.
Senator White understood from his talk
with Secretary Alger that President Mc-
Kiniey, and, indeed, the entire Cabinet,
were anxious about National finances and
did not want to pay out of the treasury a
dollar more than was absolutely necessary.
Senaior White tried to explain to the
Secretary that not a dollar would be re
quired for over a year, but Alger would
not give the Senator any definite promise
to advertise for bids. ThÂ« Senator left the
Secretary in an ugly frame of mind, and
determined to introduce his resolution in
the Senate on Monday. Secretary Alger
is aware of his intention and is now pre
paring his answer to send to the Senate.
ADMIRAL MEADE'b FVXBRAL.

Over the Grave.
WASHINGTON, D. OL, May B.â Solemn
requiem high mass was celebrated yes-
Thursday at St. Aloysius Church over the
body of Rear- Admiral Meade. A large
number of people, including many army
and navy officers, were present. The
casket was draped in the stars and stripes,
and on tbe cover were the hat and sword
of tbe dead officer and a number of floral
tributes, including a pennant.
A battalion of Uni ed States marines,
led by a marine band, escorted the re
mains to the Arlington Notional .Ceme
tery. The marines tired a volley oVer the
grave. Toe honorary pall-bearers were:
Rear-Admiral Waiter, Commodores

for th* Annexation of Hawaii.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.âRepre
sentative King ot Utah introduced a reso
lution providing for the annexation of
Hawaii. Tbe resolution declares that the
territory may be received into the Union
whenever the Government of Hawaii
shall cede it to the United States, the
Pre*ident to receive it by proclamation
and Congress to make laws for its govern
ment. It is provided that the laws for
the exclusion of Cnineso shall apply to
the islands and no Chinese there shall be
permitted to enter, the United States.
The appointment of a commission ol

commission of Hawaii is provided for.
Mr h'rnn.j Slated for the Place.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May Bâ A
Washington dispatch in a Richmond ( Va. % )
paper stated that Justice Field would
resign and that Judge Goff of West Vir
ginia would be appointed to succeed him.
This was read with interest by Califor
nians here, but no one credits its truth.
Both Sdnatois White and Perkins say
McKfima has been selected as Field's
successor and they have no knowledge
â¢ hat Mr. Field contemp ates a retirement.
They believe he will serve aa long as he is
able to perform bis duties.

that it was wholly accidental.

From Morn Till

Two Well-Backed Candidates
for the Chilean Mis
sion.
Colonel Calhoun Receives His Final
Instructions and Leaves for
Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May B.âBusi
ness at the White House opened this
morning shortly after 9 o'clock, and it was
long after H o'clock to-night when the
President had cleared his desk of corre
spondence and left the office to join his
family.
The rush for office snows no signs of
abatement, fully as many place-hunters
being on hand to- day as at any time since
the President was inau urated.
Colonel Calhoun. who started to-nicht
on his mis-ion to Cuba, was the first
caller. He received his final instructions
and th6ii went to tee State Department,
where he examined the correspondence in
the Ruiz case.
A large delegation of Republicans from
Kentucky, headed by Senator Deboe,
called on behalf of Dr. Godfrey Hunter,
who withdrew from the Senatorial race.
Hunter is an ex-Congressman and is now
contesting a Democrat's seat. He insists
that he is not a candidate for office, but
his friends would like to have him ap
pointed Minister to Chile.
President McKinley was to-day invited
to attend the s- mi-centennial celebration
of tbe founding of the Mormon church at
Salt Lake on July 24 by a delegation com
posed of Judge Barch of the Supreme
Court of Utah and George Q. Cannon,
father of Senator Cannon. A similar in
vitation was also extended to the Cabinet.
Senator Knute Nelson and ex-Senator
Warner Miller also called.
Henry L. Wilson of Spokane, brother of
Benator Wilson, is being urged as Minister
to Chile. Wilson originally applied for
tbe mission to Japan, but now that it has
been given to Colonel Buck, he has shifted
his application.
The Nitvy Department is having trouble
in landing a satisiactory ship to carry a
cargo of grain to tbe Indian famine suf
ferers. Congress appropriated money to
charter a vessel of between 2000 and 4000
tons displacement, and left the matter
with the Navy Department. Assurance
was given tue department to-day by peo
ple who are mana^in^ the philanthropic
scheme that the grain will be ready in
New York whenever the ship is secured;
but the right sort of bodt cannot be found.
The naval paymaster at New York had
three big sailing vessels on his list, but
two of them were unsatisfaciory. The
third seemed to be all right, and the de
partment wanted to charter her, but the
owners secured another cargo, and she has
sailed away, leaving the department in a
quandary. ____^________
TO ERECT AN IRISH PALACE.
Bg Fair to Be Held in New York City
by Sons and Daughters of the
Emeraid Isle.
NEW YORK, N. V., May S.â A great
Irish fair will be given at the Grand Cen
tral Palace beginning Monday, the pro
ceeas to go toward the erection of an Irish
palnce building to cost at leant a quarter
of a million dollars. The building is de
signed to shelter all Irish- American or
ganizations under one roof.
It is proposed through this fair to heal
all th- 1 differences that have from time to
time arisen among Irish-Americans,
churchmen and laymen, soldiers ana
civilians, Catholics and Protestants.
This scheme is due to the ingenuity of
Colonel James Moran of the Irish Volun
teers, an independent regiment organized
a year and a half ago under the auspices
of the Cian-na-Gael, the "physical lorce"
faction in Irish politics.
This regiment "cut in" on the Sixty
ninth Regiment of the National Guard,
which has always been an Irish organiza
tion. This action embittered the friends
of the Sixty-ninth, who have not accorded
the plans of the Irish Volunteers the
heartiest support-
It may be expected, therefore, that the
success and brilliancy of tne coming fair
will depend largeiy on those Irishmen
who stand for the ideas represented by
the old Fenian spirit. A board of trus
tees has been selected to handle the
funds, among the trustees being Recorder
G 'ff, ex-Mayor Grunt, General James R.
O'Brien, ex-Judge Browne and Colonel
William L. Brown.
The fair will be largely under the direc
tion of the wonrn represen ling the thirty
two counties of Ireland. The ladies iden
tified with the fair have been connected
with the advancement of the volunteers
since their organization.
Their presence in the management is
taken as an evidence that a large part of
the funds derived by the fair will be used
to erect a line armory for the volunteers,
I the other features, such as lecture-rooms,
etc., being incidental to the military util
ity of the proposed palace.
Among the exhibits the most interest
ing will be a veritable piece of the Blarney
stone, imported for the purpose, and the
real swoid of Brian Boru. Great enthu
siasm has been shown in the preparatory
work, and Irishmen throughout the
country will watch with int rest this ef
fort to crystalize Irish sentiment in
Greater New York.

NEW YORK, NY.. May B.â W. L.
Scruggs, who arrived to-day from La
Guayra, brought with him duplicate copies
of the, Venezuelan arbitration treaty re
cently approved by the Venezuelan Gov
ernment. Scrusgs, who was formerly
United States Minister ; to Venezuela, 'is
one of the lawyers who represented that
country in the treaty nesotiations. The
Venezuelan Minister to Washington and
the British Einbassador will sign both
copies of the treaty. Sir Julian will re
tain one and Andrade the other on behalf
of their respective Governments.
Scruggs went on to Washington. He
had intended to stop over at Princeton to
deliver a letter from President Creapo to
ex-President Cleveland, but he gave up
the design when he learned that Clevland
was out yachting.

The Great International Contest Will
Open at Chicago 'Jo-Morrow.
CHICAGO, 111., May B.â All is in
readiness for the opening on â  Monday
evening of the great . international in
door military carnival at the Coliseum.
The members of the various committees
to-day inspected the arena, bicycle track
and other features of the interior. The
United States regulars and members of
the Illinois and Wisconsin National
Guard, who are camped in the grounds
adjoining the Coliseum, are doing some
hard training. The entries require them
to carry all their equipment in the sprints
and runs, and the training, as well as the
events proper, therefore, . takes on the
form of trials of endurance as well as of
speed.
Discus-throwing has been decided upon
as a ieature of the championship pro
gramme. This is a novel event in this
country, taking/its origin with American
competitors in the Olympic games. At
Athens Captain Garrett of Princeton car
ried off the prize, although he had never
seen a discus until he had landed on Gre
cian soil.
It is thought probable that in the
meet of next week some of the results
may eclipse the fabled records of the
ancients. â¢. 'â 'â Ar : -
TUB BIBLE IX PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Heading* therefrom. Decided to Be in
Violation of the Conn titut ion.
DETROIT, Mich., May B.â Judge Car
penter in the Circuit Court to-day granted
a mandamus upon the petition of Conrad
Pfeiffar for the Board of Education to
show cause why the reading of the Bible
should be further continued in the public
schools. Pfeiffer set up in his petition
that his son, as a pupil of the schools, was
: obliged to attend religious worship, and
that he himself as a taxpayer was com
pelled to assist in maintaining places for
the dissemination of religious teachings,
contrary to the State constitution. The
direct charge was that a book entitled
"Readings From the Bible,' introduced
by the school board, was read to the
pupils every day. Tne Judge held that
Biblical readings were violations of the
constitution.
OFFER TO HI I Lit A LEVEE.

NEW ORLEANS, La.. May B.â The Illi
nois Central and Texas and Pacific rail
roads united to-day in a levee offer to
New Orleans and the New Orleans levee
board that will probably be accepted, thus
insuring the city against all future floods.
The roads agree to build a levee along the
upper front of New Orleans, seven or eight
miles long and six feei above the highest
water ever known in the Mississippi.' The
Work will cost $500,000, and the railroads
agree not only to build the levee, but to
maintain it. In return for this the city
is to allow the railroads to build and
operate as a belt line a double track on top
of the levee. The proposition will prob
ably bs agreed to by the City Council, as
it will put an end to all scares about high
j water.

PRESCOTT, Ariz , May B.â ln the gen
eral shake-up incident to the transfer to
the Santa Fe of the Atlantic and Pacific
road, Seligman, seventy-two miles north
west of this city, is to become one of the
most important points on the line. The
place was once known as Pre?cott Junc
tion, having been the initial station of tne
Prescott and Arizona Central Railroad,
abandoned for several years since the con
struction or the Santa Fe, Prescott and
Phcmiix road. Its main disadvantage has
bee. i the scarcity of water. This is to be
remedied by tne construction of a dum in
a lurge valley near by.
Work on the structure has already com
menced, several hundred teams ueing em
ployed in the necessary grading. Nine
hundred carloads of Portland cement has
been ordered for the dam, which is to be
fortv-hve feet in height and which is to
cost at least $100,000. Work has also com
menced on a -torage dam near Ash Fork,

SOLOMON VILLE, Ariz.. May B.â
George Cluff, for the past two years Pro
bate Judge and School Superintendent of
Graham County, has been found guilty in
the District Court of forgery and will be
sentenced May 28. The conviction has
created a profound sensation, for Cluff,
tnough a young man, is known through
out the Territory and has been held in tho
highest esteem. For years he was super
intendent of the public schools of Pima.
Four years ago he was the candidate of
the Republican party of Arizona for the
office of councilman at large. He is mar
ried and is a prominent member of tbo
Mormon church. , . . â  . , ,; -Â
Six indictments were found against Cluff
by the Grand Jury, all charging him with
fraudulently raising the figures on teach
ers' vouchers for pay. The charge on
which he was convicted was that he ha i
raised a $30 voucher to $34, An especially
unhappy teat are of the case lay in tne fact
that the voucher had been issued to the
sister of the prisoner, she thus being com
pelled to become a witness against him.
A plea for mercy is to be made on the
allegation that Cluff for tue past year has
been mentally unsound. .

denr excuses ihe faults of the bill, saying
the Republican members of the Financa
Committee were urobabiy forced against
their will to put in certain features not in
line with past Republican measures, but
which nevertheless will produce the re-jL
quired revenue. These Congressmen say,
from the tone of the President's remarks,
they feel confident he will be entirely sat
isfied if the Senate bill becomes a law.
The President, however, is very dÂ«eDly
concerned at the prospect ot a lonz debate
in t c Senate, and proposes during the
next few weeks to use all the power of the
Federal administration to hurry the bill
as rapidly as possible, so it can get to con
ference at an early date.
Ie is said those appointments made dur
ing the next few weeks will hare a direct
bearing on the tariff question. la other
woras, when appointments can ba made
for the purpose of gaining friends for the
Uariff bill they will be made.
Friends of Senator Jones claim he has
twelve Republican votes besides his own
in favor of the stand he has taken for duty
on hides and other nchedules in which the
far West is particularly interested, anl
these men will not yield, no matter what
may be the demands of their Eastern col
leagues who are opposed to a duty on
hides.

Will use every means to light the pro

England Continues the
Shameless Plan With
Ostentation.
Kruger Cleverly Withdraws the
Only Excuse for Hos
tilities.
Nevertheless the Englishmen Con
fidently Expact to Aaraln
Raid the Transvaal.
LONDON, Eko., May B.â lnterest in the
Transvaal almo t overshadows the atten
tion paid to the war in the east. In Eng
land systematic efforts to inflame public
sentiment against the Boer Government
continues under the auspices ol the Char
tered Company and Tor? party.
Shameiess preparationi for war con
tinue witn much ostentation. War-shout
ers are again disgusted by Kruger's clever
withdrawal of the Immigration law, which
is the only plausible excuse for belligerent
agitation in England. It is supposed that
this action of the Volksraaa is the result
of pressure coupled witn a conviction that
the law conflicts with the London con
vention.
So far from this being the case, the opin
ion of one of the most eminent English
authorities on international law to whom
the matter was submitted in behalf of the
Transvaal is opposed to the contention
that the law is contrary to tne convention.
Transvaal, therefore, is credited with
having made a genuine concession. AÂ»
regards tne alleged breaches of the con
vention in connection with foreign
treaties the opinion of the same authority
in one instance is favorable to the view of
the Transvaal and another is unfavorable.
In either case the point involved is merely
technical. Nevertheless the average Eng
lishman firmly believes a glorious cam
paign against the Boer republic will be
one of the spectacles the Government will
provide lor the celebration of the jubilee
year of the Victorian era.
DROWNED AT STOCKTON.
Two Men Ssnt to Their Death in
the Waters of McLeods
Lake.
STOCKTON, Cal., May B.â Two men
were drowned this forenoon in McLeods
Lake, about 100 yards west of the club
house of the tstock.on Athletic Associa
tion.
The barge Katie was discharging a load
of cordwood on the north bank of the
lake. A young man named John Robin
son, who went to work a day or two ago
on the barge, leaving his home in Antioch,
was trucking the wood from the barge to
the bank.
He walked down the gangplanK with
the truck behind him. One of the wheels
ot the truck struck against the side of the
gangplank and the wood was thrown off.
RoMjMoa tripped on a piece of wood,
and went over me gangway. AÂ» he fell a
piece of -wood went down also, striking
iiim on the head.
Nothing more was seen of the young
fellow. He was known to bs a Rood swim
mer, out he did not rise after disappear
ing below the surface of the water. The
probability ia that the pi?ee of wooct ;hat
struck him on the head knocked him
senseless or stunned him.
A Bearch wa- immediately made, and
the portion of the lake between ttie barge
and the wharf was dragged in me hope of
bringing him up, either dead or alive, but
without avail.
Wiiiie iha men were still dragging the
lake for the body of t <c boy, Chris Johu
ton, the fireman of the steamer Clara
Crow, came on board that boat, which
towed the barge to her position and whict
lay tethered to her further side waiting
to tow her off when she had discharged
her cargo. Johnson was seen to have been
drinking, and it is said that he had fallen
off the Clara Crow twice before this morn
ing.
Johnson went to hii room, took off his
clothes and jumped overboard, evidently
with the idea that he would find the body
of Robinson, aÂ» he wag an expert swim
mer. He did not come up, and later his
body was dracged from the lake.
A man named Flaherty essayed to go
down and locate me bodies, and he, too,
came near drowning, but was rescued in
time.
BACK FROM TURNAGAIN ARM.
Schooner Albion Brings Cheering N ws
From Miners Who Wintered
in Ainsko.
SEATTLE. Wash.. May B.â The steam
schooner Albion, Cap:ain Charles Lind-
Quist, which 'aiied from San Francisc
early in the spring with miners and mer
i handise for Cooks Inlet, returned to this
port to-day.
She is tie first vessel to arrive direct
from the inlet since last fall, and conse
quently brings the latest news as to how
the people parsed the winter months on
far-off Turnagain Arm.
Those who regained over fared fairly
â well, the weather being unusually mild
for that section and food supplies reason
ably plentiful. Duriniz the col. lest <iay
March 2 â the thermometer registered only
10 degrees be^ow zero.
On the south side of the inlet the placer
mines could be worked every day through
out the winter months, and all of ttie
miners were more or less successful, tne
claims yielding from $5 to $15 a day to the
man. Tho-e who had claims on the
north sine were unab;e to work tbem, ow
ing to an un usual fall of snow. ThÂ»Â» best
winter-woricin ' claims are between Kisloff
Kiver and Anchor Point.
The Albion sought to land her passen
gers and car^-o on the north side of the
inlet, but being unable to do so, owing to
the slow, discharged both at Coal Bay,
where some six or eight persons, includ
ing one woman, parsed the winter com
fortably. She made the return trip from
Coal Bay to Seattle in ei^hi days.
Captain Lindquist stated that there
would not be nearly as many miners on
Turnngain this year as there were last
year, but the indications were that those
trying their fortunes there would be much
more successful, especially the ones who
located claims last fall and winter.

DARCET ISLAM* GOLD CRAZE.
rraiprctoi* at Vorlc in the Midst of a
Lrper Colony.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May B.â The
mining excitement in British Columbia
is said to exceed that in California years
a<ro. There are now as many prospectors
in the field as there was population in the
province before the excitement. Tnis
lust for gold has perhaps reached its
climax in conquering the fear of leprosy,
for white gold miners are working hard
Â»y the Chinese lazaretto on Darcey Island,
where a colony of hopeless lepers am
awa ting the end, housed with pigs and
chickens as companions and visited rarely
even by medical men. Gold having been
discovered on the island, the Government
will not allow the lives of American and
Canadian prospectors to be endangered
by contaminated Chinamen, and the
lazaretto will probably be removed.

Crime of Anton.
PORTLAND, Or., May B.â After
twenty-three hours' deliberation, a verdict
of not guilty was brought in by the jury
in the case of Marcus Wolf of ' San Fran
cisco, a member of the firm of Wolf
Bros., wholesale clothiers, accused of
arson. The fire occurred in Juiy last and
Henry Jacobs, the main witness for the
prosecution, testified that the defendant
hired him to tire the stock. This he did,
but, he declared, he never was paid for
his infamous work. Upon to-day's ver
dict hinges the payment of $28,000 in
surance money, the policies being held as
collateral by the First National Bank
here. The matter will go to the Supreme
Court.
Attempted Suicide at Mormon.
VISALIA, Cal., May B.â Ed Hill of
Monson, a small railroad station sixteen
miles north of this city, tried to commit
suicide this forenoon. Hill is dying from
consumption, and is unable to leave his
invalid's chair. He asked his sitter to bring
him a razor with which to pare his rinrer
nails. This the child did and with the
dull edge of the weapon Hill gashed his
throat. Had the razor been sharp or bad
he not been so weak he would have suc
ceeded in causing death. As it was, the
gash was not deep enough to prove fatal.
Hill is only 19 years old.

Handicap.
Jockey Lamle Returns to Form
and Puts Up a Superb
Finish.
Pittsburgh Phil's The Winner, With
Tod Sloan Up, Beaten by
a Head.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 9.â The Metro
politan, the iirst of the great spring
handicaps, was ran at Morris Park this
afternoon in the presence of 15,000 per
sons. James R. Keene's smart three
year-old Voter, ny Friars Balsam, won
after a superb finish, with George Â£.
Smith's four-year-old The Winner, with
the three-year-old filly Casseopia by
Friars Balsam, owned by Alfred H. and
David H. Morris, third, and August Bel
rnon t a four-year-old Hastings, by Spend
thrift, fourth.
In the absence of Requittal, First Mate
and Handspring, Hastings was a pro
nounced favorite, and the followers of the
Belmont colors lost heavily on him.
Voter was fortunate in getting clear of
his field at the start, and Lamle, who had
the mount, displayed rare judgment in
letting the chestnut rate along instead of
pulling him about. The Winner and Cas
seopia had to thread their way through a
maze of horses.
Sloan rode a most patient race on The
Winner, And fifty yards from the turn
seemed to hare the race won, as Voter
was in trouble. It was then that Jockey
Lamle proved that he is not a back num
ber. Instead of rolling in the saddle or
going to whip, he rallied the three-year
old in masterly fashion, encouraged him
and squeezed home a winner by a foot in
the good time of I :4OJÂ£. It was by far the
most brilliant piece of horsemanship
Lamle has shown in years, and the puolic
gave him a rousing reception when he
returned to the stand.

Broach Declines to Give
Way to His Suc
cessor.
Says He Will Hold the Office
by Force of Arms if
Necessary.
Moores Prepares a Plan of Attack
and a Serious Conflict Is
Looked For.
OMAHA, Nebb.. May B.â Uniformed
police are to-night on guard at the May
or's office in the City Hall, and the indica
tions are that Omaha will have two May
ors on Monday. Mayor Frank E. Moores
will assume the office by reason of having
been chosen at the recent election. With
the assistance of the police force, which is
controlled by a fusion Board of Fire and
Police Commissioners, ex-Mayor Broach
says he will continue in office, and he
also threatens to exercise a forcible re
sistance to any effort Mayor Moores may
make to assume the office.
Broach's immediate supporters openly
boast that the entire police force of the
city Will be ready to support Broach in
his pretensions, and that if necessary the
National Guard of the State will, be called
out to prevent Mocres being seated. It is
currently reported that the Boards of Fire
and Police Commissioners will support
Broach and select a new Chief of Police
who will do their bidding.
The determination of Captain Broach
is shown by the fact that he and his ad
visers have made out a list of men who
are to be appointed special policemen for
the purpose of preventing Moores from
taking charge of the Mayor's office. These
men have been enrolled in the ottice of
Sewer Commissioner Winspear, and they
have been notified to bold themselves in
readiness for duty. Broach maintains
that Moores cannot qualify because he is
in debt to the county and therefore in
eligible.

Past Grand Master P. P. Gosbey of San
Jose responded in apt words to the wel
coming address, impressing upon the City
Council and the citizens of Gilroy the re
sponsibility they assumed in establishing
the home here.
Gounod's "Praise Ye the Father" was
rendered by a choir, and Mrs. C. A. Hox
ett, president of the board of trustees of
the home, briefly addressed the gather
ins. Following a prayer by the grand
chaplain of the Rebekahs, Mrs. M argot
ten of San Jose, the ceremony attending
the placing of the cornerstone was con
ducted by Airs. Marian Greenwood, the
grand president of the sister order, and
tier aids.
This wns especially historic, it being the
first time when women hare had charge
of a cornerstone laying for thi* order.
The cornerstone was presented to the

When the stone had been placed in

, Cornerstone," and written by Mrs. Fidelia
\ W. Gillett, was rendered by the Glee Club,
! and Mrs. Reese, P. 8. P., of Santa Crnz,
â  recited an original poem. The oration of
the day was delivered by Grand Master J.
W. W'arboys of Santa Rosa. He said in
part:
Happy on Kb t to be the man or woman who
I is permitted to be with us on this important
j occasion. While others are languishing on
j beds of sickness and sorrow we are enjoying
'â  health, strength and a reasonable degree ot
i prosperity.
Here, on this beautiful spring day, sur
; rounded by these hills clothed in emerald
â¢ preen, their slopes bedecked with beautiful
I flowers and on whose sides the peaceful herds
show ihelr satisfaction with their lot, we,
breathing the balmy air of this Ja;r clime, are
assembled to begin a work for which we have
long labored, a work that has occupied the
thoughts ol many during their waking hours
and of which they have dreamed during their
hours of sleep.
We stand here beside this wall in which is
[ to belaid the cornerstone of a monument to
J be erected to the faithfulness of those who
4 THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
I loved the little ones. We see your faces
beaming with gladness at the fulfillment of
this your long-felt wish. As we here stand
to-doy to assist in laying the cornerstone ot
this edifice we know thai the real foundation
has been laid in your hearts for many days
ami the building erected in your hearts many
times. We also realize the truthfulness of
the old adage that "God helps those who help
themselves."
To us this should be both a day of sadness
and a day of rejoicingâa day of sadness at the
thoughts of tne many who are suffering for
trie necessaries of life, suffering for the loss of
fiiands, suffering lor the loss of father or
mother, or both; a day in which we may de
vote, our thoughts to those who are less for
tunate than we in the struegles of life; a day
in which we will not rejoice over our suc
cesses, but extend our sympathy to those in
soirow and in need, ever remembering that
we are ail one great lamily and the suffering
of one of the race but increases the pains that
dart through our own systems.
As this building is to be erected by laying
one stone correctly on another or by properly
nailing one board to another board, so are the
characters of the children who are to livo here
to be formed by one lesson added to another
lesson.
We have assembled tc-day to perform a. duty
both sad and Dleasantâsad because of the
necessity of such a gathering and pleasant
because wo iÂ»re able to be here and take our
part In this work of love. It Is right and
proper for us to review the past and learn if
we can find the cause of this outpouring of the
people of this community and of the order.
We find that many of our very best citizens,
both men and women, are studying both day
and night to devise means for relieving gome
of this sorrow and suffering.
What are the causes of this suffering and
trouble? Perhaps it would be well at this
time to consider gome of them. First, lack of
employment for the laboring class; second,
too much book knowledge mught in our pub
lic schools; third, not enough lime devoted to
training the young in the practical way of
earning a living; fourth, the avarice of capi
tal in not giviug labor, the foundation of ail
wealth, its just proportion of the proceeds de
rived from labor; fifth, drink, intemperance
and living beyond our means.
While cood school education should not for
one moment be discouraged, good, common,
practical sense should be taught at the same
time. Our children should be taught that
education is not for the purpose of avoiding
work but to assist in that work. Education
cannot take the place of labor, and it does
seem to me that at the present time too much
stress is placed on education to tate the place
of labor instead of assisting that labor. The
boy should not be taught that education will
take him from the plow, the saw or any other
position, but that it will make him a better
piowman, a belter carpenter or a better citi
zen in any occupation.
Man is prone to selfishness and it requires
persistent effort to overcome the effect ot
this characteristic of the human family: it
requires hard, untlnnr, persevering labor.
A spear of corn comes outof the ground and
gradually grows aim produces tho full stock
and ripe corn. At no time can we see It grow,
but still it moves on in its unostentatious way,
gathering for its own use the elements from
the soil that are suited to its purpose. So may
the little ones who may be sheltered in this
home eather from the lives of those around
them the elements that shall make them good
and true men and women.
Short addresses were delivered by oth
ers present, "America" was sung by the
entire audience, the benediction was pro
nounced and the ceremony was at an end.
Afterward the visitors were taken in
carriages for a drive through the valley,
ana in the evening many attended the
play at the Music Hail by local talent un
der the management of C. R. Weaver. It
was entitled "A Fisherman's Luck." A
dance followed the performance.
Contractor Boyle of San Jo-e has the
new orphanage up to the second story,
and one can already see what a beautiful
structure it will be. It is situated at the
souti.west corner of Forest street and
Hoxett avenue on a tive-acre site pre
sented to the trustees by Mrs. C. A. Hox
ett of Gilroy. This philanthropic woman
has worked indefatigably and spared
neither expense nor trouble in securing
the home for Gilroy.

AT SAN QUENTIN

Paroled.
The Board Declares Against
Giving Out Convicts'
Photographs.

Which Money Was Sent to
"Ohio Fatty."
FAN QUENTIN PRISON, Cal., May 5.â
The Board ol Prison Directors met to-day,
paroled two prisoners and passed a reso
lution excluding the newspapers and
oihers from taking photographs of pris
oner*.
Ernest Easton, a prisoner, 24 years of
age, who was convicted of an attempt to
escape in Napa County, for which lie was
sentenced to five years' imprisonment
from August 30, 1895, was paroled, as was
William J. Bpaipht, age 25, convicted of
robbery in Ban Francisco and sentenced
to ten years' imprisonment from March
12, 1893.
Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson were
granted the contract to furnish the boil
ers, ranges and all kitchen utensils for
the new kitchen building.
A resolution was introduced to the ef
fect that in the future no picture of any
prisoner, either in citizen's or convict's
clothes, should be given except to Chiefs
of Police or Sheriffs without special per
mission of the board of directors. War
den Hale said this resolution was made
necessary because of the number of appli
cations from petty oflicers and others who
desired pictures of various convicts, and
that it was not made with the intention
of especially excluding the newspapers.
The board adjournnd to meet at San
Quentin on June 12.
Prison Director James H. Wilkins
showed a slipper that had been sent to
Frank Wheeler, alias "Onio Fatty." Un
der the sole the leather had been hollowed
out, and in the hole was a dollar bill and
a touching note sayins that the amount
this time was amal., as this method of
sending money to him was an experi
ment, but if it was successful other
amounts and maybe a little opium would
follow.
The prison authorities in inspecting the
slipper to-day, discovered the note and
money. The job was done neatly and to
get at the money it was necessary to pull
out a thin piece of cloth on the inside of
the shoe.
Frank Wheeler is the convict who
escaped from Sing Sing and Joliet and
hid for sixty hours in the juiemill at San
Quentin in an effort to escape from this
pri on. He stabbed "Kelly the Rat" a
week or so ago in seii-defense. He is a
desperate prisoner and has many friends
on the outside who are always ready to
aid him.

urer \V. H. McKenzie stated to The Call
correspondent to-day that he never per
sonally loaned any of the municipality's
money in his charge. His inability to
turn over the full amount which the
treasury books called for to his successor
until yesterday, several days after he
should have surrendered the office, was
due to the failure of the Loan and Savings
BanK, where he had deposited the city
funds, and of which institution he was
cashier. The bank, and not he, Mr. Me-
Kenzio explained, had loaned the money,
and when it failed did not have the
money belonging to the city on hnnd.
The Treasurer had to take securities and
realize on these before he could make up
the funds of thÂ« municipality. The Loan
and Savings Bank suspended in 1895,. and
J. G. James was president of the institu
tion at the time.

Built of Wood Instead of tone by the
Author's Direction.
LONDON, Eng., May B.â Some comment
having been occasioned by the fact that
the monument erected in Hampstead
churchyard over the cremated ashes of
George Dv Maurier is of wood rather
than of stone the explanation is made in
behalf of the family that it was so direct
ed in the will of the late artist and author.
The design of the monument is sim
plicity itself. The corners of the struc
ture at the head and foot of the grave are
carved uprights in ilia form of ancient
Celtic* crosses'.-- From the uprights run a
centerpiece on which Is carved Dv Mau-'
rier's name, date of birth and death and
the following lines from "Trilby": :â¢ â¢
â  A little trust that when we die, â¢ . â¢ â¢ :
And boâ good- by. . .

AWBLL-KNOWN PHYSICIAN SPOKE YES-
terday on the subject of Skin Disease, fie
until: -'Diseases of the skin are more liable to
develop in the spring of the year; than at, any other
tune. The reason is scientific, yet plain.
'â¢During the fall and winder months the system
becomes run down, the blood ! sluggish or thin and
watery, the stomach Is foul, the liver torpid, the
kidneys and bcwv.n irregular. These condition"
invite or produce skin disease. In all skin diseases
yon need a constitutional treatment. Nothing
else can rei;ch in* skin. If you do not take con-
stitutional treatment you cannot remove the cause
of the trouble, and you cannot cure any skin dis-
ease unless you remove the cause."
Now li the time to take a constitutional treat-
ment, and Joy's Vegetable Â£ar.->aparilla is one of
the best constitutional treatments known. I'bysi-

Exciting Game Played in

Stanford.
Palo Alto and Oakland High j
School Teams Fail
to Score. ,
Neither Side Cains an Advantage,
and the Match Ends With
HonoVs Even.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., May j
aâ One of the most etching games of j
b*Bket-ball ever played bere was that in \
Encina gymnasium ibis afternoon be- !
tween the Stanford Girls' Varsity basket- j
ball team and a team from the Oakland
High School. So evenly were they
matched that neither side was able to
â core. In addition to the regular fifteen
minute halfs, the teams played an extra
ten minutes without success for either
Bide.
With the exception of medical attend- j
ants only women were allowed to witness i
the match. About 300 spectators watched j
the game from the galleries with breath- |
less interest. Sixty members of the Oak
land High School came down to cheer
their representatives on to victory.
The idea that college yelling at a con- i
test must be done only by college boys is j
erroneous. Throughout the game the sharp j
"Rah, Rah, Stanford I" and the equally I
decisive yell of the Oakland maidens coul I
be heard for blocks around.
Miss Palmer, gymnasium instructor of
the Oakland High School, and Miss Steb
bins of Stanford alternated a? umpire and |
referee. According to Dr. Wocd, who at- J
tended the game to give medical aid |
should an accident result from any of the I
hot scrimmages, the fair Oaklanders ex
celled in team work, while Stanford had â 
the stronger individual players. .Both
Hiss Merritt of Stanford and Miss Morgan
of Oakland captained their teams well,
and each put up a strong individuai
game.
The game was not marred by any acci
dent. The best of feeling prevailed. Aft- :
erward, at a lunch served at Roble Hail !
to the visiting team, toasts were proposed
by different members of the two team;,
which showed the friendly feeling they i
had for each other.
CONCERT AT STANFORD.
University Choral Society and Apollo Club
of San Francisco Score a
Success.
I'ALO ALTO, Cal., May B.â The Choral
Society at Stanford, assisted by the Apollo
Club of San Francisco, scored another tri
umph tbis evening. The concert given in
Encina Gymnasium was pronounced by a
critical audience to have been even supe
rior to that rendered last year.
The chorus sat on a platform, which
was tastefully covered with drapery, and
the singers weie garbed in harmony with
the decoration?.
The first number was a chorus from
â¢*Tannh&U3er," "Hail Bright Abode." It
was rendered with great expression and
showed careful training. The trombone
effect such as Wagner intended for the
chorus, was brought out with precision,
and the effect was thrilling.
Of the selections from "The Messiah,"
by Handel, the chorus entitled, "Behold
tue Lamb of God," seemed to make the
most impression on the audience. A light
dancing number was owed by Schu
bert's "Forth to the Msadows." The
quick, happy measure of the song was one
of the features c: the gramme.
Perhaps the chorus which tested the
ability of the sinzers most was Moritz
hauptmaan'i ' "i; Linden Tree." In
this song the chcri^s did itself proud. All
ol the diffico : airs were truthtully em
phasized, and the rendition was warmly
appreciated b7 the - race. Mendela
pn:.n- chores, "Hs I*. Watching Over
Israel," was wall rendered.
Thecho.-.i nnsiSersd about two hun
dred members, if oat of the Apollo Club
came down en & special train from San
Francisco, altaoa/n BOOM arrived earlier
to vis: the university ground?. The con
cert will be repeated â  weei from to-night
in San Francisco.

Judge Dougherty lfteidf* a Cute Againat
SANTA ROSA, Cal., May Bâ Judge S.
X- Dougherty rendered a decision to-day
in the case of F. Berka vs. J. G. Wood
ward, as City Treasurer, deciding in favor
of the plaintiff.
The action was brought to recover about
$400 for lumber bought from Berka by the
city and used in the construction of a
sewer.
The city did not deny having bought
and used the lumber and admitiel that
the price charged was reasonable, but
pleaded that the contract was void be
cause Berka was a member of the city
council that ordered the lumber.
The Judge decided that the contract
was merely implied, and the use of the
lumber inu.hed that a reasonable value
would be paid for it. Berka, acting in
good faith, had fulfilled his contract vvH;.
out objection from any on>-, and no con
sideration of T'Ublic policy would require
that he shou.d not receive compensation.

WOODLAND, Cal, May B.â Mrs. W.
H. Souie, the wife of an old resident and
business mar; of this city, committed
suicide at Winters last night despondent
because of ill health. About a week ago
the unfortunate woman went to Winters
to visit her sister. Last night before re
tiring 3he appeared to be more melancholy
than usual, but the family had not the
slightest suspicion that she contemplated
eelf-des. ruction.
Eaily this morning an unusual noise
was heard in her room. Relatives has
tened and found Mrs. Soule up and
dressed, but the glassy expression of her
eves told the story. She admitted that
had taken strychnine. Physicians were
called, but they could not save her life.
6he left the following note:
My Lear Husband: I am afraid I will lose
my mind. I am going to take a big; dose of

The Steam-Schooner National City as She Appeared Alongside the German Ship Marie Hackfeld
Yesterday. The Scene Shows the Ship Takin? in a Big Piece of Redwcod â About
9000 Feetâ for the Paris Exposition. The National City and Marie Hackfeld Were in
Collision Last Friday Morning, but a Few Hundred Dollars Will Repair the Damage.
A DAY'S CHAPTER
OF ACCIDENTS
Two Vessels Ba iy Injured
While Making a
Landing.
One Cut Forty Feet Away From
a Wharf, fee Other Crashed
Into a Ship.
i
, Olficers of the Planter, S. G Wilder
and Alcha Were. Also 1 jar d
During th? D y.
Collisions and accidents were the main
features of interest on the water front yes
-1 terday. The steam schooner National City
ran into the German snip Marie Hack:e.d
and did considerable damage.
The French steamer Madeleine made a
connection with Beale-street wharf that
: will mean several hundred dollars in re
pairs to teat structure.
The mate and carpenter on the S. G.
t Wilder were almost killed by kicking '
| males, and Kenneid'* chief clerk was
; nearly killed aDoard ins barken tine !
, Planter.
Some water-front fiend who has a grudge
against Bill Benat, the well-known water
, front boniface, poisoned his three squir
; reli, his chipmunk ana his parrot. The
j little animals died, but after a dose of salt
the parrot threw up toe poison and is now
, alive ana hearty. The squirrels and the
| chipmunk came from folsoxn prison.
1 Captain Smith, second mate of the ts. G.
j Wnder, was at that time a guard in the ;
j State penitentiary.
Both the squirrels and chipmunk were
born in jaii and Captain Smith brought :
! them to San Francisco. For over five 1
years they have attracted the attention of j
j every child that passed along Clay street ;
! to the ferries, and now that they are dead '
i their owner would give $50 to know who â¢
â¢ poisoned them. A post-mortem examina
tion shows that arsenic was t-e cause cf
their death. The parrot is still alive,
however, and keeps up the cry ail day .
long, "Who stole my monkeys?"
The nr.-t accident recorded was that on
; the schooner Beulah. She left this port
; on the 7tn ins:, for Grays Harbor and
anchored on the bar. While hoisting the '
' anchor to proceed on her way the hsh
book split and struck the hand of Mate
Gas Bum, cutting his finder off. Tne
Five others :iove in 3ignt and B.urn was !
transferred to her and brought to this City.
The Beuiah proceeded to sea.
Captain K. Garrison, chief clerk for
Kenheld & Co., met with a serious acci
dent on the barkeniine Planter. He had
been to the vessel on business and was j
! bidding good- by to Captain Dow on the j
I poop deck when be lost his footing and !
:e.. to the main deck, fracturing four of !
\ his ribs. Captain Dow took him to his i
home at Fruitvaie last evening, and from
last accounts he was doing well.
Four of the crack Hawaiian liners
started on a race for Hawaii to-day, and
every one of them had an accident to re
] cord before getting under way. ; The one
I on the Planter has already beÂ«n recorded.
On the S. G. Wilder, while taking on board
a number ot mules for the plantations
1 one â  f the animals got loose and not only
i kicked Second Mate "Tom" Smith into
insensibility but nearly killed the car
â  p;mer. A doctor was called in, and .after
; careful treatment be gave It as his opinion
that both men could go to sea without
danger.
The Wilder takes out fifty-two mules
I and the Aloha has over seventy, while the
i Planter's consignment has " not been
: counted.
j Tne Hawaiian climate is not conducive
to mule longevity, and the consequence is
that erery vessel that leaves here for
, Honolulu, Kahuiui, Main Jcona and other '
ports in the irronu tafces a lull load of the
hybrid-. Plantation J does not suit them,
: and tbe demand is always greater than
the supply.
The French steamer Madeleine was
j again in trouble yesterday. When on her
way here from South America, the gas in
. t:;e oil tanks exploded and wrecked the j
;en me room. Sue was towed to this port |
J and has since Been in the hands of the i
Rtsdon Iron Works. She had her trial !
yesterday, ami did well up to the time ahÂ«
; came to dock at Beale-street wharf. Then
when the signal was eiveu to reverie, the
| engines tailed to answer, and, the steamer
' crashed into the wharf. Nearly forty feet
of the structure was cut into, and the cost
of repairs will De considerable.
As near as can be gathered the cause of
; the trouble was as follows: The vessel \ '
! had been out on her trial trip and Captain I
! Freeman, one of the best-known pilots in
I California, was in charge of the shit.
â  After making 3 circuit of the bay she was
| headed for Beal<>-3ireet wharf, and en
I neannir it the slow bell was given. Next :
I the signal "stop" was rung up and the
steamer came down to a speed of about a
, knot an hour. When the signal "full
speed astern" was rung up the engines
tailed to respond. Th n Captain Ham- \
mon took command and rang up full speed
astern twice and .still there was no an- '
swer. I Then came j the crash and forty
feet of'Beaie-street wharf will have to be !
repaired in consequence.*
The steam schooner National City came
down from Eureka last Thursday and on .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
Saturday morning was in collision with i
the German ship Marie HacKfell. The i
latter ij loadin- lumber for England and j
the National City was to put her car;ro I
into nor. While trying to tret alongside j
the steam schooner lost sie.-raijevay and ]
crashed into the sailing ship. Luckily J
she struck right against the main deck i
beam and in consequence the damage was ;
slight. The general report aurin the j
afternoon was to the effect that $40,000 j
won d not repair the Hackfeld, but Cap- |
tain Metcalf, Lloyds' surveyor, says that j
$400 will come nearer to tne figure. "Had ;
the National City struck the Hackfeld j
either a foot or, say, six inches in one ';
! direction or the other 1 wou'd not like to !
give an off-hand answer as to the coÂ«t of :
repairs," said hÂ« yesterday. "As it is, ;
she struck the ship right plumb on the j
main d-ck beam, and I would like to take
the repair contract at $500 and then I
would have money left over with which j
to treat all hands."
As soon as the workmen found that the :
damage was slight the work of taking in
the steamer's cargo began. The first piece
taken out was the handsomest piece of
redwood ever sent out of California. It is
bonnd for the Paris Exposition and is 14x
14x3 feet. One of the Astors stands sponsor
for the exhibit and re will see to it that
the giant of California is given a good
showing. As the biz slab lies on the deck
of the Mane Mackfeld sixteen j eopie
could easily dance a quadrille on it. Stood |
on end the same people could go through '
a set of Lancers and just how many peo
ple will tramp over it when it Is placed on
exhibition in France remains to be seen.
The general impression along the water
front is teat the schooner General Siglin
went down at the same time as the ship
Samaria. Private letters from people '
who left here after the ill-fated vessel go
to show that she is now long overdue. Chief
Officer Saunders was the brother of the pop- ;
ular chief officer of the big steamer China.
For twenty years they had never met, and
the Saunders of the Siglin remarked when
he was signing articles, "I will never meet
my brother until I hold as good a position
as he does."
The Percy Edwards has been heard
from once again, and it now appears that
the Adamless Eden is now in the Fiji
group. A private letter, dated April 14
last, says that all the party were at
Leonka. and were trying to make their ;
home on the group. the Governor of the \
colony la at Suva, and until he is heard
from nothing can be done. In the mean
time the would-be colonists are possess- '
ing their souls in patience and inci
dentally eating up ali the provisions they
took with them from San Francisco.
JAPS TO BE CHECKED.
Precautions to Be Taken .-1 gainst Their :
Entering Th:Â« Country la Viola- .
tlon ot Law.
la view of the fact that Immigration i
Commissioner Stradley has reason to be
lieve that Japanese are entering this port
from Victoria, B. C, by means of fraudu
lent certificates, a new system of inspec- j
tion will hereafter be adopted.
Heretofore it has been the custom for
the inspector to receive from the parser of
incoming steamers from the north the
certificates of all the Japanese passengers.
who were permitted to laud as long as the
number oi certificates agreed with the |
number of pa.sÂ»Â«ngerz.
This course of procedure was practiced '
as a matter of accommodation to the Pa- i
cific Coast Steamship Company, which j
operates the steamers between this port j
and Victoria, as it allowed of the certifi- i
cated Japs being landed without delay.
In iuture each Japanese will be in
spected separately and compared with the â 
description of ins certificate in his pos- i
session.
Another regulation will also be entered
more strictly than heretofore. As the '
Japs who come here from Victoria are :
mostly new arrivals from their home
country, arriving at the British Columbian
pert on the Canadian trans- Pacific line of
steamers, they will be compelled to un
dergo a medical examination as if they
had arrived direct from Jaoar,.

Di-pecs d With
The meeting of the heads of the mun
icipal departments yesterday to consider
; the financial stringency accomplished
very little though it became patent to
every one that something mast be done,
and done quickly. The matter, after a
desultory consultation lasting a couple of
hours, simmered down to an alternative
of the City employes consenting to their
salaries for June being held over until
July 15 or the merchants who have
trusted the City for supplies losing thou
sands of dollars because of the funds of
this fiscal year being exhausted before the
claims are met.
In addition to the heads of departments,
there were present the Mayor and Super
visors Hawkins, Devany and Rottanzi.
Clerk Russell of the board explained
that if the taxes bad been paid up as they
' shoaid have been there was no need of a
: shortage, but that as this source of
revenue ha>l fallen short the City's affairs
were in a muddled condition.
The question of cutting off heads to save
: money so that the deficiency might be
met was taken up, but- it did not go far,
because those who were asked how many
! men they could spare at once said that
â¢ they needed all of their men and could
i not run their departments without them.
| County Clerk Curry, License Collector
Lees, City and County Attorney Cres
well and Dr. Williamson of the Board of
Healtti all declared that their men were
absolutely needed.
Then Sheriff Whelan took a hand in
> the discussion. He said that it was evi
dent that few departments would consent
' to a decrease in the number of employes
i and that the only solution of the problem
seemed to be to hold out tne June sal -.ry
warrants of the employes of the City Hall
! until after the new fiscal year is under
I w >y. He said that he could speak for his
department. :;-.;':
Auditor Brodericc protested. He stated
; that if the warrants were presented to
\ him and demands were made for them he
would have to deliver them up. Of course,
if the warrants were held in the depart
i ments and not given to him he cou d not
sign and could not be held responsible.
It was explained that a month' 3 salary
i roil would just about cover the deficiency,
and it seemed for a time as though this
course might be adopted, but a somewhat
: acrimonious discussion* arose between
County Clerk Carry and Auditor Broder
ick over the increase in thÂ« expenses of
i the two offices, and the main issue was
lost sight of for the moment.
When the exchange of doubtful pleas
' antries ceased Clerk Russell stated tnat in
his mind the only solution of the matter
teemed to be that suggested by Sheriff
Whelan, that of holding back the June
salaries. -
Coronor Hawkins and others declared
that they would not vouch for the willing
ness of their subordinates to wait for their
money and the discussion became general
without anything being decided on.
Chi-f of Police Lees suggested that ex
penses in the Police Department might be
reduced by the City buying the outside
' stations, for which rent is now being paid.
I Supervisor Haskins stated that such a
j project was tinder consideration by the
I Health and Police committee of the board.
The question of collecting back taxes
' was brought up and City and Conn tv At

refused or neglected to pay, as rapidly as
possible.
Tax Collector Blocs remarked that if
these suits were settled successfully it
would turn $150,000 into the treasury,
which would be plenty to meet all de

It was understood by all the heads of
departments that they were to sound their
employes as to their willingness to wait
for their June salaries until the middle of

of the northern pan of Italy, familiar to tbe
people of Tnrio, from where It took i.s name, but
actually can be found almost la every to el, and
its use is so widespread that. it can be found al-
most on every table of rich ai well as of poor
people.

of the p.iste. which baa to be well raided, and the
most careful baking, -o as to obtain a uniform i
bread. lhÂ« form It Â«elf explains how carefully and
skillfully it has to be made, and shows at once
howh>ai:hfnlit mint be, not only for the thor-

THE NEW HOME
OF "THE CALL"
Greatest and Handsomest
Newspaper Building in
the World.
Uniqu? Among All Modern
Structure; â Arch itectural
Ma:terpi;ce
The Principal Contractors Who Have
L nt io the Ccnitruct on of
tha Eu:!ding.
It is merely a matter of a few months
now when the magnificent new home of
The Call, on the southwest corner of
Market and Third streets, will be com
pleted. Then i^an Francisco will have
one of the greatesi modern buildings
on the continent and The Call a hand
somer and more complete home than any
other newspaper in the world.
In exterior construction the new build
ing represents an immense but very beau
tifully designed tower. The first three
stories form the base or pedestal. These
ere treated in the massive style, with
heavily rusticated courses and arched
openings for windows. The next seven
stories, being the body or snaft of the
tower, are very fimple and plain in treat
ment.
Above them the ornamentation begins
npain, sparingly at first, but culminating:
at the thirteenth story in a richly carved
and ornamental frieze, which forms the
ecttin^ for the massive cornice that sur
mounts it. The fourteenth story is treated
in a lighter design, being in effect a col
onnade, with pilasters between the many
windows, while the fifteenth story, being
circular in contour, forms the base for the
beauti-'cl and imposing dome.
Tue dome rises seventy feet above
its foundation; and surmounting the
dome is a richly ornamented lantern, or
belvedere, thirty ieet in height. The en
tire building will be 315 feet in height.
This is an elevation nearly double that
reached by the highest point of any other
building in San Francisco.
The main entrance, a grand archway
twenty feet wide and thirty-five feet high,
with massive carved columnson each side,
supporting a richly carved entablature
surmounted by a balustrade, wili be on
Market -treet.
between the second and third stories,
on a line w:th the top of the main en
trance, is carried a projecting cornice sup
ported on medallions ovei nn ornately
carved frieze. The windows in the third
8 ory are treated in a richer style of orna
mentation than those below, vet are arched
ana massive in appearance, carrying out
admirably the general design. In truth,
the whole building is one of the most
symmetrical and harmouious pieces of
modern architecture.
At the top of the third-story windows
there runs a heavy, ornamented belt or
cornice forming the cap for the pedestal
or base wh:ch supports the rising shaft.
How begin the plain stone facings, held
in place, as is ail the stone wort, by the
steel framework of tbe structure, and the
seven stories of the shaft or superstruc
ture, severely plain and simple in style,
arse. Above them begins the ornamenta
tion again. The eleventh and twelfth
Ftories are treated as one with columns
running the full height and the windows
surmounted by carved capitals and arched
with carved architraves and beautifully
decorated spandrels that nil in the space
to the entablature above.
The thirteenth siory, treated as a mag
nificently carved frieze, witti its graceful
cornice, forms one of tne main features of
the building. The fifteenth story, which
forms the base of the great dome, is cir
cular in outline, and the corners of the
square are occupied with octagon-shaped
turrets supported at each an^le by col
umns and surmounted by carved dome
ebapeii tops.
At this line begins the ribs of the great
dome. The lantern at the very top of the
giant buildine is surrounded by an open
colonnade and will be used as an observa
tory and ior signaling purposes.
Â£o naucu of the exterior of the great
building. The contractors who have con
tributed to the construction of the new
home of The Call have shown rare
ability, and the following is a brief
description of a few of tiie leading firms
who have lent their services.
THE EXCAVATION.
In the construction of the new home of
The Call the most experienced and com
petent contractors and builder 3in all the
country have lent their services in the j
erection of one of the grandest architec
tural works in the world.
Probably the most difficult contract,
that was performed with such great skill
and ability as to elicit much commenda
tion from architects and buildera as well
as the general public, was the work of ex- j
cavation by Contractor A. E. Buckman of I
this City. "
In order to make room for the fonnda- |
tion, which extends out on all sides of j
building twelve and a half feet, under i
the sidewalks ol the streets and
under the ad joining building, an excava
tion twenty-five feet below the level of the
street was made. The bulnheading and
holding up of the streets and adjoining i
property while the work was in progress i
was a most difficult matter, but so ex- â 
pertly was it bandied that not an inch did
the adjoining buildings swerve from their
uprigit positions nor did the street give
way whi c the work was in progress.
Mr. Buckman is to be highly commend
ed for nis expertness in handling with
comparative ease such a difficult and im
portant undertaking.
THE STONE THAT IS USED.
The stone work is being executed by J.
D. McGilvray & Co. It is quarried into
large blocks at Mormon, Or., and shipped
direct to this City to the yards of the firm
in queation at Second and King streets,
where it is cut and carved and entirely
prepared to be set in the building. J. D.
McGiivrny & Co. nave done considerable
work during the past few years, notably
tlie Emporium building, the stonework of
the park lodere, tho residences of Mrs.
Gibh, Miss W. M. Bourne and J. C.
Pozadas; the Wilcox building at Lot
Angeies, the building erected on ihe site
of trie old American Exchange and the
Hobart building on Post street and others.
x FOUNDATION STEEL WORK.
The most improved form of steel con
struction has been used in the foundation
work of this masterpiece of modern archi
tecture, the new home of The Call.
Much of the stability of so massive a
structure depends upon the work of the
foundation, and in this regard no safer,
more reliable or competent firm could
hare been chosen to handle the work than
thnt selected, the Risdon Iron Works.
" The tensile strength of all the steel
beam?, plates and anchor-bolts in the
foundation is 60,000 to 63.000 pounds per
square inch, with an elastic limit of 30,000
to 34,000 pounds.
'1 he Risdun Iron Works is one of the
largest linns of its sort in the country.
Among liic big contracts that the com-
I pany has been recently Interested in is
> the structural steel work of the new ferry
! depot building, now in course of construe
] tion. The plant cf the iron works, which
i is situated at the corner cf Howari and
j Berry streets, occupying an extensive area
I of ground, iÂ«, however, not confined to
! structural work alone, although they
; make a specialty of this particular line.
* They nre manufacturers of mining, mill
; ing, marine and otner machinery of any
I required magnitude, pnd deal extensively
! in Coriiss, automatic and slide-valve en
| gines. .
CONCRETE FOUNDATION AND
CONCRETE FLOORING.
The stability of so tall a structure as the
new home of The Call depends greatly
upon a substantial foundation. Gray
Bros, were the contractors for Mr. Spreck
els in this important work. The whole
nineteen floors, which are constructed of
concrete, are the work of the >ame firm,
this material having been used through
out instead of tiling, which adds creatly
i to the strength of the building and abso
j lutely prevents vibration.
Gray Bros, have the reputation of doing
j tbe finest and most durable work of any
I local contractors.
THE WINDOW-HINGES.
The windows throughout tbe new home
of Thk Call will be equipped with tho
"Model window-hinge," a new inven
tion â simple, useful and practical. It is a
device which doe 3 not interfere in any
way with the ordinary operation of the
window or mar the woodwork. The
sashes swing into the room and are
cleaned while the help stands on the
Model Window Hinge.
i
' floor. The simplicity of the mechanical
construction of this detachable hinge is a
feature particularly in its favor, rendering
i it thus impossible to get out of order.
The working of the hinge is ea-y and
; simple. It is applicable equalK to a large |
â  or small building, new or old. If the wind j
i blows or it is cold the shade may be drawn
j inside the opened sash and the embrasure
! closed.
The inventor of the model window
hinge is R. Guy McClennan of this City.
; At the office of tne company in the
' Mills building the invention is on exhibi
: tion, attracting the attention of many i
I prospective builders.
â¢
THE SAFES.
The new home of The Call will be
equipped with safpa in each room fur- |
nished by the Hermann Safe Company of j
j this City. This is a large contract, one |
i of the largest ever let in this City, and re
! fleets great credit not alone upon Mr.
1 Hermann to have procured this big un-
I dertaking, but upon the enterprise and
!_ . I
John Hermann,
progress of this State and the position we
occupy in the manufacturing and me
chanical world.
Mr. Hermann's locks and vaults were
not alone considered by Mr. SpiecKe s to
be among the best in the country, bat were
also among ihe cheapest. This firm does
a large business in expert repairing of
safes, vaults and locks.
Among those industries which have
reached a high standard in California
during the past few years is the safe and
lock business, and the Hermann Safe
Company of San Francisco occupies prob
ably the foremost position in this line.
THE STAIR WORK, ELEVATOR
ENCASEMENTS AND DUPLEX
COPPER-PLATING.
One of the most important contracts in
the constructural work of the new home
of The Call, from an architectural stand
j point, it that of the duplex copper-plating
; work by the California Artistic Metal and
I Wire Works ol thiÃ City. The work mi
i eluded in this contract is the framing of
! the doors and windows and the encase
j merits of the elevators, which are all in
duplex copper, and alÂ«o the construction
of the stairs from the basement to the top
of tvs tower, in like material.
Much work has been done by this estab
: lisnment in artistic metal and wire work
i and iron furring and wire lathing for
j ceilings and partition construction in
moat all the large buildings in San Fran
cisco, the most recent structures being the
Parrott building, the Spring "Valley Water
Works building and the Emma Spreckels
block.
A great deal of the artistic metal work
which heretofore had to be imported is
| now being made by the company, which
j has Inaugurated on this coast one of the
| largest and most efficient plants in the
i United States.
HABDWAfiE 00NTEA0T.
The hardware for the building is to t>e
furnished by the Palace Hardware Com
pany, 603 Market street. It will be of ttie
P. <t F. Corbln manufacture and of the
finest quality ai ye: used in any office
building on the coast. Tho kuobs, escutch
eons, letter plates, etc., are to be of spe
cial design, with monograms on cacli
knob. The Stanley "ball-Oearing" binges
and "Bommer" spring hinges are to be
used, and the destfjn and finish of every
detail is to be carried out with a view to
fitness, beauty and durability.
THE PLUMBING SYSTEM.
The plumbing, by Duffy Bros, in the
new home of The Call, is one of the finest
pieces of work in any building in the
country. The pipes throughout will all
be wrought iron, instead of galvanized ma
terial, and will be joined with malleable
iron fittings.
Duffy Bros, is one of the leading firms
in their line in tbe country. Tbey have
iieen the contractors in most all the large
building* in this State that have been c n
structed during the pnst decade. Ttie
Mills building of this City, and also the
Crocker, the Chronicle, the Mutual Li.'c
and the Academy of Sciences buildings,
a* well as the ferry depot building now in
course of construction, are a few of the
grand architectural works they have con
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
tributed to in California during the past
decaJe.
ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND ELEC
TRIC CALL SYSTEM.
The electric lighting and electric call
system throughout the new home of The
Cail is being constructed by the Califor
nia Electrical Works of this City. The
wiring is encased in iron armor lined
with insulating material, which is
a great improvement over the
old wav of encasement. The Cali
fornia Electrical Works is too well
known on the coast to require com
mendation.
THE HEATING AND MARBLE
MOSAIC WORK.
The steam-heating plant in tbe new
home of The Call is the work of W. W.
Montague ct Co. There is a radiator in
every room in the building and the pro
cess of heating will be by exhaust steam
from the boiler-room.
The marble ino-aic work in the main
vestibule and hallways is also the work of
the same firm and will all be carried out
in an appropriate pattern of most artis
tic design from special drawings by the
architect. Foreign marbles, cut in half
inch squares and inlaid in artistic pat
terns, will form the /ioorway of the main
vestibule.
In point of architectural beauty this will
be one of the finest pieces of work, in the
country.
The Call building will ba one of the
highest structures in the United States
that is heated with exhaust steam.
ThÂ» radiators in the various rooms will
be iitted with eveiy recent and ornamental
improvement.
W. W. Montague & Co. is one of the
largest and best-known houses in Cali
fornia. Any extended account of the
fine workmanship this firm is doing in
the new bui.iJiug is unnecessary. Tiiey
have lent to the construction of most
nil the large and modern buildings that
have been erected in this State, and they
all stand as testimonials to the eminent
skill and ability of this old and reliable
house.
THE ELEVATORS.
There will be three elevators in the new
home of The Call. The cages will be the
most commodious of any in the City, and
the rate of ipeed Â»i!l exceed by Â£0 per
cent the fastest elevator in San Francisco,
running, as they will; at the rate of 600
feet per minute. From the basement they
will extend up to ihe nineteenth story, or
within one story of i tie top of the tower.
The Crape Elevator Company of Chi
copo, represented In Sin Francisco by
N. L. Ball with headquarters la
the Crocker buildinjr, will have the
contract for the construction of
the elevators. The reputation of this
establishment is too we 1 and favorably
known 10 require extended commenda
tion on t tie iii.c work they propose <!oi:ig
in Ihe new home of The Call. The ele
vators in the Mills buiiani" ot this City, as
well as the Chionicie and tut Emma
Sprecke!s buihlinp, are all the work of the
Crane Company and bear evidence of great
sKili and ability.
The process of signaling the elevators
that will be asen by the Crane Company
in this new building wi.l be as unique as
it i? modern and comp etc. There will te
two electric bat tons on each floor in front
of the elevators â onÂ© to signal lor the car
going at) ward and the otner for the car
descending. As tlie first car going up or
down, as may be desired, approaches
within one tloor of that where the signal
is given the elevator attenaant will be
signaled by the flasn of a red light in his
face.
Tnis notifies him that on the next floor
in the direction in winch he may be go
ing there is a passenger. The new device
does away with the unnecessary worry
and trouble as well as loss of time often
experienced in trying to signal elevators
in large buildings.
It is the intention of the Crane Elevator
Company, who are always on the alert for
the latest and best elevator devices, to
make the plant in the new home of The

San Francisco, Cal.. May 8. 1897. i
Genfemen: 1 have called a conference at the
rooms 01 ttie Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, City K-l!, next Thursday, May
13. at 4 P. M., In order to tirr.ve at some under
standing between the companies whereby the
appearance of the City will be improved in the
matter ot laying conduits in the thickly set
tled portions of the City for the purpose of
carrying wires and the abandonment of poles
and overhead wires bs now maintained.' You
will oblige me by sending â  representative to
such conference, and co-operating with the
City in carrying out the programme of munici
pal progress In these directions, so that we
may take our place among the cities of the
country.
The maintenance of polos and wires, you
will agree with me, is a ci.siignrement of the
s reet* and an impediment to tircmeu in the
discharge of their duties; on the other mho
we have no disposition to embarrass the com
panies in their desire to give us perfect tele
phonic and telegraphic service. Good results
can be obtained only by the fullest ci-oper
ation between the companies and the City,
and I will rely upon your co-operation as citi
zens us well as in your corporate capacity as
>ying valuable privileges. Yours ' r Iy ,
James 1). Phki.an, Mayor.
At the same time lie mailed the follow
i ing letter to John I. Sabin, president of
i the Pacific Telephone ana Telegraph Com
pany:
Dear Sir: Property-owners in the Western
Addition have made formal complaint to this
oflise that you are erecting poles in frr>nt of
their property without permits. 1 desire to
call your immediate attention to the fran
chise under which you are operating, viz..
Order No 218*5 of the Board of Supervisors,
and to section 5 therein.
After quoting the franchise the letter
resumes :
I a' so call your attention to resolution of
j the Â«rd of Supervisors, approved February
12, 1884, and numbered 16,828, new series,
and still in force, which compel* all telephone
and telegraph companies to apply for per
mission to erect po.es and in each case to
specify the location of each pole before the
j work (I begun. As you are acting without
permit I notify you to proceed no further
until such permit bi granted by the Board of
Supervisors.
In this connection I invite you or your rep
resentative to meet me at the rooms of the
Street Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
City Hall, next Thursday, May 13, a; 4 o'clock
p. x. I have Invited the representatives of all
the companies maintaining poles in this
City, so that an understanding may by ar
rived at with respect to the future policy of
the companies. The telephone company, I
am aware, h*s laid conduits in the principal
streets, a policy which should be followed by
telegraph and other companies using wires.
This work should be done before the streets
are permanently paved.
The maintenance of poles and exposed wires
is not only a disfigurement of the City but a
serious impediment to firemen In their work;
ami no great city in the country tolerates the
maintenance of such nuisance in its thickly
settled sections except San Francisco. The
City will rely upon your full co-operation,
which, we trust,' will be given. Very truly
yours, JamerD. Phklan, Mayor. *

Tlie People's Mutual Telephone Com
pany broke ground yesterday morning
near the junction of Sacramento and Mar

structing a competing telephone system.
The work of piftting in conduits within
which to place cables will progress vigor
ously. The managers of the company an
nounce that the work of construction will
be actively conducted and the whole line
completed within the time specified In tUe
franch.se. It is said that a large force of
men will bs employed next week.
The company is closing contracts for
machinery in large quantities. The elec

IN PEEOITA VALLEY.
The ImproTement Club Increasing the
Number of Snug; Homes.
On both sides of Army street the bed of
the old Precita Creek is being transformed
from its original condition. The streets
are being brought up to grade by the ap
plication of red rock dumped in from the
adjacent Bernal Heights quarry. All
this has been accomplished by the per
sistent work of the Preoita Valley Im
prorement Club, which has succeeded in
extending Precita avenue from Folsom to
Alabama street. Bernal Park is left thir
teen feet below grade.
To have this filled in is the wish of the
residents in this section, as expressed by
John T. Graham of tne executive com
mittee at the meeting of the club last
Friday night.
This little pocket, 800 by 250 feet, and
running from Alabama street to Folsom,
is at present thirteen feet below crnde,
while within fifty yardfc stands a quarry
of red rock and clay that can b* had for
the taking.
The club is also agitating the replacing
of the old wooden sewer in Bryant street
by one of more substantial quality.
A resolution having tne indorsement of
the club was ordered sent to the Super
visors requesting them to locate an engine
house and company for the protection of
the property in that locality. It was
stated that the nearest enjrine-house at
present is located at Folsom and
Twenty - second streets, which is too
remote to be of service 10 the dwellings
situate about the City and County Hos
pita', as also about the Precita Valley and
Snn Bruno road.
811. Behrins of the executive committee
reported that the offensive pool of stag
nant water in front of tbÂ« German Catho
lic church on Folsom and Amy streets Is
being tilled in, and he hoped that similar
action would be taken with the low
swamps owned by M. B. Jon'sandthe
heirs of the O. C. Pratt estate, the present
condition of which retards the advance
ment of the entire valley.

CIGAR WAS "LOADED."
AÂ« a mi It of Â» Joke Balthazar Zopfl
I* Charged With Aagmilt to Com
mit Murder.
Balthazar Zoj.ti, a cigar-maker, 24 years
of eg?, played a joke upon Henry Tripp,
a boy, last Wediu s lay night, and now he
is in the City Prison on a charge of assault
to commit murder.
Zopfi met Tripp on Mission street, near
Twelfth, and gave him a "loaded" cigar.
Tripp had just commenced to smoke it
when there was a flash of powder and
Tripp grabbed the cigar and threw it on
the eround. His face and ripht hand were
slightly burned . ana he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where his burns were
attended to by Dr. FitzzibbDn. . '
Tripp told a cock-and-bull story of a
man driving up in a wagon and throwing
HOPE SEEMED GONE
HIS BACK ACHED, HIS MUSCLES WERE SOFT, HIS
eye had lost its hue, his hair fell out, he was a miser- .
able man. He was so irritable he would grind his teeth at
the least provocation. A single stir or movement near him
would bring on the jumps. He was afraid to look you in
the face and afraid to do business with his best friend.
One by one he lost his friends, and his acquaintances would
cease to bow. Yet, no one thought he was sick. But he
was sick. He was so sickâ so sick at heartâ had com-
pletely drained, exhausted, bankrupted his body. His vio-
lating the laws of nature and his dissipation and his reck- 'â â '[
l ess _ yea) heedlessâ abuse had collapsed his frame.
TO THIS MAN HOPE SEEMED GONE
But it was not so. * The Hudson Doctors took him in
hand and heroically labored with him. : The great HUDYAN '
remedy-treatment was used. HUDYAN was administered
in small particles and increased. After three months the
man was a sightâ he was a sight that no one would believe
unless they ; knew the man. He was so thoroughly satisfied
v . he wrote a testimonial letter for HUDYAN. and Hudson

Bearing Fruit- -Tenants Ordered to
Leave by June 8.
Work on the proposed new Postoffice to be erected at the corner of Mission and
Seventh streets will begin July 1.
The work of demolition of the buildings still remaining on the site will begin
about the 15th of June.
These important steps, it is admitted on all sides, were ordeied taken through the
efforts of The Call.
Notices were issued yesterday to all the tenants occupying the structures on the
Government property by Collector of Customs John H. Wise to vacate within thirty
days from the date of notice. This is a copy of the notice received by one of the
tenants:
Office of Ccstodiak United States Postoffice Pite.J
tAN Francisco, Cal., May 8, 1897. }
Joseph Mclnarna, SSS Stevenson streetâ Sib: You will please take notice that I, as custodian
for the United State* Government, hereby notify you that any right which you may have or
claim to remain in possession of tlie premises known as No. 0(55 Stevenson street, on the new
Postoffice site, and any tenement thereon, is hereby terminated, and that you will within
thirty days :rom this date promptly deliver possession of said premises to me, as the custodian
aforesaid. John H. Wise, Custodian. *
This development was not unexpected to any of the Government's tenants, as
something of the kind had been expected ever since the site was purchased by the
Federal authorities. AH who rented or occupied any of the premises knew they were
taking the risk of being ordered to move at any time on short notice, and the uncer
tainty ol their tenure was partly compensated by the low rents they were charged.
No more rent will be Hereafter collected, and the next four weeks will see an
unusual scene of activity along Stevenson, Jessie, Mission and Third streets. There
are some twenty buildings on the Postoffice site and they are occupied by about
thirty tenants, all of whom will have to remove to other quarters between now and
the Bth of June.
Within a week after the premises have been vacated the work of demolition will
begin, and by the first of July it is expected to have everything in readiness for the
corps of graders and masons who will begin the foundation work.
Full details of the plans of the authorities are given in the annexed dispatch from
Washington and in the following interview with Colonel Joh n P. Irish.

SUCH CURES ARE REPORTED EVERY DAY.
This simple fact cannot be questionedâ Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is responsible for more cures of disease and weakness
than all the other remedies combined. It is a noteworthy fact that of all the advertised remedies on the market to-day there
is not one which makes public the number of cures-of home cures-shown by this meritorious article. Surely such evidence
must bear weight. It is not a question of delicacy with these people who say Dr. Sanden's Belt cured them-it is a matter of
human gratitude-gratitude for their cures and desire to let others know where the cure is to be found. These people are well
known in San Francisco-their friends are buying Dr. Sanden's Belts on their recommendation. It is known by hundreds of
their neighbors how sick they were and how they got cured. If you doubt it still, call on them or write for their testimony-it
will be given gladly, for they are grateful people and will be glad to set other unfortunate sufferers on the road to health. ;
iti, 1Â° me v a ," d WOme Wh Â° are sick and weak this famous Electric Belt is worth more than gold, because it brings health
without which there can be no real happiness-no pleasure. The warming, vitalizing life fluid which it sends jumping through
the veins brings happiness-it tills the heart with joy and gladness. It warms up the blood and makes its wearer feel that there
is a brightness in lifeâ it makes everything look bright and makes the burdens and cares of existence lighter through its power
of giving health an strength to fight the battles of life No sick person need be sick any longer; no weak manor woman
need feel the loss of vital force when here is a means of regaining it. Throw aside drugsâ they only poison your stomachâ take
up thefrue source of healthâ Electricityâ it will cure you and for only as much as one month's doctor bill costs.

/THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
ACTUAL WORK ON THE NEW POSTOFFICE WILL BE BEGUN JULY 1.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â On April 16 THE CALL published exclusively the announcement that work would sogn begin on
the San Francisco Postoffice, and that steps would immediately be taken to prepare specifications upon which bids for the grading and
excavation would be advertised for. This sudden determination of the Treasury Department was brought about by Congressman Loud
of San Francisco. He called the attention of the department to copies of the San Francisco CALL containing expressions of mass-meetings
and of commercial bodies and prominent citizens of San Francisco, as well as editorial expressions of the paper. Assistant Secretary
Spalding promised him that the work would be commenced without delay and he has kept his promise.
The Supervising Architect of the Treasury was seen by the correspondent to-night. He said that advertisements for bids for the
work of dismantling the buildings now on the lot at Seventh and Mission streets were now on theirway to San Francisco and would be
published in THE CALL.
Instructions have already been sent to the Collector of Customs at San Francisco to see that the tenants on the Seventh and
Mission streets property vacate the premises before the middle of June. It is expected that the work of dismantling will be commenced
by June 15 and that excavation for the foundation will start by the Ist of July, as heretofore stated.
tracts for the excavating and foundation work will be let as soon after June 1 as pos
sible. The testine of (be site has been going on continuously for months. The result
shows the ground to be the best in the city. Plies cannot be driven into the eround,
it is so hard. Why, over 100 piles have been shattered like toothpicks in the attempt
to force them down during the test.
"The letting of this contract means the continuous working of a large force of
skilled and unskilled laborers of San Francisco for months to come. I hope to see
between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000 expended before work ceases. San Francisco will
have one of the finest buildings in the United States.
"The letting of tne contract and the beginning of the work at this time is in no
small degree due to the recent agitations. Bo much had been said against the site
that the officials at Washington were somewhat doubtful about beginning, but per
sistently advocating it in the manner The Call did helped to hurry action.
"ifix- President Harrison, a Postmaster-General, two Attorney-Generals and
numerous engineers have viewed the site, and every one of them has spoken favor
ably of the location. It was the largest, best and cheapest property offered to tne
commission at the time it was bought. lam sure the citizens will be pleased to know
definitely that work is to be commenced bo soon, and when once begun it will be
continued to completion.
"The postofflce would have been started long ago had the people of San Francisco
been of the same mind as they are now. They fought the proposition tooth aii'i nail,
andjseemed unable to realize that they were hurting themselves by so doing.
"The newspapers of San Francisco are in a great measure responsible for the de
SAILORS' YARNS SPUN.
Mate MeN cbols of the Harry
Morse Charge! With
Crue ty.
Variance Between the Testinuny of
toe Witnesses as to the State
of the Weather.
Sailom' yarns were freely spun on
Friday in United States Commissioner
Heacock's chambers in the case of the
United States a ainst Patrick McNicnols,
mate of the American bark Harry Morse,
recently from Sydney and Yokohama with
a carco of coal.
McNichols was charged by Andrew
Anderson, an old tar, with cruelty on the
high seas. Anderson swore that when the
bark was twenty-one days out of Sydney
McNichols became displeased with the
apparent lack of agility displayed by
Anderson while doing some work and
knocked down Anderson with an iron be
laying-pin, the usual weapon of pirates in
times of profound peace. This was, so to
spcatc, the entree, and for dessert Me-
Nichols kicked him in the ribs so bad that
the rest of the crew imagined that a ship
with a circus on board was off the star
board bow and that the bass drummer was
practicing.
Anderson then shifted his quid and
swore that on several occasions thereafter
McNichols bent and n bused Him.
The belaying-pin incident occurred be
tween a quarter past 8 and 9 o'clock. No
member of the crew was nearer than forty
or tif ty feet to the mate and Anderson.
Half a dozen Bailors swore that it was a
bright moonlight, and that everything on
the deck could be seen distinctly. Captain
Lane and three or four sailors swore that
the night was pitch dark and that it was
raining harpoons. Three or four others
swore that it was a starlight night and
that the deck was illuminated with the
light on th? galley.
Captain Lane said that the galley lights
were always extinguished at 8 o'clock in
the evening, and that, %% the alleged as
sault took place a quarter or half an hour
afterwara, the witnesses could not have
seen the two men plainly.
McNichols swore that when he spoke
sharp.y to Anderson about his work, An
derson struck at him with a beiaying-pin.
McNichols then knocked him down with
one blow of his nst.
Notwithstanding that Anderson testi
fied that the first assault took place
twenty-one days out from Sydney, and
that the other assaults were committed
after that lime, several other sailors
swore that the belaying-pin incident and
other batteries took place before the bark
had been twenty -one days out.
Captain Lane said that tin- sailors were
engaged in a conspiracy against him be
cause tie had had some trouble wiih the
Sailors' Union, and that on account of
that trouble he had great difficulty in get
ting a crew.
Commisiioner Heacock continued the
case to this morning when he will hear
further testimony. The fact may be de
veioped that there was an eclipse of the
moon on the night of the belaying-pin in
cident, that being the only thing lacking
to make the tentimonv truly versatile.
ALEXANDRIA ATTACHED.
The Creditors of Mm. Josephine Wal
cott Place It in the Hands of
the Sheriff.
The Hotel Alexandria, the fashionable
apartment-house at 781 Butter street, is in
charge of Bherlff Wdelan, having been
attached yesterday on claims aggregating
11800.
Mrs. Josephine Walcott, the lessee of
the house, has been in financial aifficul
ties for some time past, and a writ of
possession was sued out by the owners
some days ago.
Yesterday the creditors became anxious
and attached the furniture and carpets of
the 120 rooms, and the sale is advertised
for tne 14th lnst. There are mort
gages aggregating over $4000 on the con
tents of the hoiel, and It is t;rooable that
its affairs will be wound up immediately.
A humorous incident was connected
witti the levyine of the attachment. The
bellboys and servant girls soon saw the
drift of affairs and straightway inaugur
ated a miniature strike. Seeing no fur
ther chance of employment or pay they
cut up ail sorts of pranks and were soon
packed up and out of the house. Before
the elevator-boys left they pinned the fol
lowing note on the door of the cage:
This elevator is closed. Too much wajjesâ

Mrs. Walcott ascribes her financial dif
ficulties to her inability to collect out
standing accounts.
STRUCK BY A CAR.
Charles 1.. Koch, an . xprentman, Seri
outly Injured bjr a Collision on
Folsoin Street.
Charles L. Koch, an expressman living
at Twenty-fourth and Chattanooga streets,
pot mixed up with electric-car 1090 on
Folsom street yesterday morning, and
came out considerably battered and with
Jus rig badly damaged.
Koch was driving along the cartracn ou
bis way to the ferry. When between First
and Second streets the electric-car struck
toe rear part of his wagon a:id he was
thrown to the ground.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
in toe ambulance, where Dr. Weil found
that his right thigh and shinbone were
fractured and there was a wound on his
right eyelid and upper lip.
Koch puts sll the blame upon the mo
torman. He said: "I was driving along
the track to the ferry and heard the noiae
of tne electric-car coming behind me. I
pulled my horses off the track, but before
my wagon got clear tne car struck it,
turning it over, and I was thrown about
twenty-five feet. One of my horses was
also thrown down. I did not hear the
bell, and I am sure the motorman did not
ring it."

lay. The great warfare against the site was, however, before The Call came under
its present management, and I must say that that paper has done good work during
the past six months in agitating the matter, and if the same progressive stand hud
been taken years ago, San Francisco would by this time, perhaps, have had her Post
office. However, no time will now be lost, and a few millions from the National
treasury will be spent among local merchants."
BUILDINGS TO BE SOLD.
Collector Wise Confident That the Work on the New Structure Will Be
Vigorously Prosecuted.
Collector Wise stated last night that toe notices were served simply to comply
with the law of the State, which requires that thirty days' notice must be given to
tenants to vacate. He added that as soon as all the premises had been vacated he
would cause to be published an advertisement offering all the structures for sale, with
the condition that they shall be removed by the Ist; of July, as he understood that
the Government would orJer work to begin on the foundation at the beginnine of the
fiscal year.
He remarked that he did not anticipate any trouble from the tenants, as the
Government had the power to remove them summarily if it chose to take such a
course. It is the intention, he said, of the department to now push the construction
of the new Federal building with ail possible expedition to make amends for past
delays and disappointments.
DRILL AND BATTLE.
The High School Cadets Could Not
Defend an Attack by Company
L, N. O. C.
There was quite a crowd at the Chutes
last night to witness an exhibition drill
by the cadet company of the Lowell High
School, Captain Edwards, and after that
a sham battle between the cadets and
Company L, N. G. C, of the First Regi- â 
ment, Second Brigade, Captain Eggert
commanding.
The drill was by two platoons, and was
very acceptable, and after the drill the
cadets took charge of a GUling'gun to
prevent the enemy, Captain Engert's com
pany of sixty men, from capturing it
The cadets had out thirty men. The at
tacking company was divided into squads,
and as they approached they were met
with the fire of thÂ« Gatling and of the
cadets' rifles, when the tire was returned,
and there was some rapid firing on both
sides. The ammunition of the cadets
gave out first, and the members of Com
pany L made a charge, drove the cadets
back aiid captured the gun, which they
rolled off amid the cheers of the crowd.

LUOKY WONG WOON.
That Was What He Thought for a ;
Moment Yesterday.
Wong Woon, convicted of stabbing
Yick Yee, was sentenced to three months
in the County Jail by Judge Cook yester
day.
Woon thought he was getting off easy,
but Judge Cook ordered him to appear be
fore a magistrate and answer to a charge
of perjury, which was committed by him
while testifying in his own behalf during
the trial. The bond in the second case is
$2000, and if convicted Woon will have to
serve a term in the State Prison.
â  t Yee Kue, Leo Seek and Han Sing, wit
nesses for Woon, were also remanded to
custody in order that they might be ex
amined on the accusation of perjury for
false swearing in this case. Their pervari
cation while on the witness-stand was so
clear that their testimony was altogether
disregarded by the jury.
This action is in consonance with the
course marked out by Judge Cook some
time ago, when he announced that he
would not allow any person to trifle with
justice in his court, and that he would is
sue warrants for every witness who com
mits perjury in his presence.

IN HUMAN BRAINS
An Interesting Discussion
of an Interesting
Subject.
Helen Gardener Dispels an Old-
Time Erroneous Im
pression.
Weight, Size and Eevalopment cf the
Braia Do Nut Differ in Man
and Woman.
â¢ Tall, swarthy and handsome Rabbi
â¢ Nieto introduced Helen Gardener to a fair
' audience last night in Golden Gate Hall;
'fair in a double sense â it was fair in pom;
.of numbers and lair in sex, there being
only about five men present, and one oi
â 'them, occupying a front seat, burrowed
' hU bosom with his gray beard and snored
. during the entire lecture.
It was just like a brute of a man, and â 
' be -was old enough to know better.
Mrs. Gardener's subject was "Sex in :
Brain," her purpose being to dissipate
(he common impression that woman, in
tellectually, is the inferior of man, and
'hat physicians have found, by means of
the microscope cud scales, that her brain
is lighter, less dense and less developed
than that of man. This impress-ion was
. fostered by alleged statistics of pseudo
scientists.
Dr. "William A. Hammond had stated
in the public prints that woman should
' not be allowed to develop what brains sue
. bad because she possessed but little, and
even that little was of inferior quality. He
contended that the differences between
the brains of man and woman could be
â  discovered by the microscope and the '
scales. Her brain was smaller, he said;
that through fundamental organization i
- and,, naturally and potentially, exclusive
of environment, she was incapable of un
biased judgment and judicial fairness, :
and that she was not capable of great
work in Ibe domain of literature.
: He said also: "It is only necessary to
compare the average male wi:b the aver
age female brain to perceive at once the
vast difference between them. The male
'brain is larger and the secondary fissures
more numerous, while the specific gravity
of both the white and gray matter is
greater in man than in woman."
â¢ Asainst these assertions of Dr. Ham- ;
. mond, made with the characteristic dog- ,
rastrsm of the proiession, Mrs. Gardener '
cited the vast difference in weight be
tween, the brain of Cromwell and Gam
betta, the latter's being 900 grammes
Uchter than Cromwell's, and she clinched ,
' the matter with the declaration that the
largest human brain on record is that of
a negro criminal idiot.
â¢ The speaker quoted an instance in which
it was found that the brain of an unedu
cated Housewife wpi^hec a little more
than that of Daniel Webster.
Dr. E. C. Swtzser. the greatest authority
ia the medical world on the brain, wrote ,
a letter to the lecturer, in which he said '
tiiat she might hold him responsible for !
the dec!ara:ion that any statement to taÂ«
.effect that an observer ran tell by looking
at the brain or by examining it micro
scopically the sex of the person to whom
it belonged is not- founded upon any
â¢-scientific assumption. He denounced the
..statement as false that the microscope
snows different characteristics in tne male
and female brain. No differences had
â  been â  found. Numerous female brains
.. -exceeded male brdiis in weight and in
â compÂ»exiiy of convolutions.
1! he had 100 female brains and 100
mate brains mixed up together he would :
te.ee. the 100 largest and best developed;
ones as belonging to more males than
females, for the reason that the average
' male individual weighs more than the
average female individual.
.'" In fact, the speaker argued that medical
'. men were all at sea with reference to their
"theory on the weight and development of
the brain as being an indication either of
sex" or of intellect, and to fortify her posi
â¢ lion she cited the fact that some of the
best physicians in England declared that
*' the brains of five Terra del Fuegan In- '
dians submitted to them without explana- ;
tion were the braius of average English- j
men. Yet scientists said that the Terra
del. Fuegan is the lowest of the human
race in the scale of intelligence.
The meeting closed with a few remarks
.from Rabbi Nieto.

SHIELS ESTATE CONTEST.
Brother and "Widow of the Deceased
Quarrel Over the Property.
Attorney Hiram W. Johnson of Sacra
mento appeared before Judge Coffey yes
terday and asked for an eariy trial of the
contest in the estate of Edward E. Shiels,
deceased. Mr. Jobnson and Henry E.
Monroe are attorneys for Mary Elizabeth
Shiel 5 , widovr of the decedent, who claims
tbe entire estate. In this she is disputed
by Dr. George F. Shiels of this City,
brother of the deceased.
When the case was called Attorney
Morrison of the tirni of Morrison, Stratton
& Foerster, objected to going into a gen
eral trial of the issues invoivei, saying the
case had been partly heard by Judge
Siack, and that a transfer of the ca^e had
been made to Judge Coffey's department
in order that certain phases of the litiga
tion might be decided.
Mr. Johuson said he bad no such un
derstanding, and declined to proceed un
less the case in general should be taken
up and disposed of according to the facts.
Judge fclack wa-< appealed to in order to
clear up the controversy, and said he
tboushi 3Jr. Johnson's idea of the situa
tion was correct, so the trial will proceed
this week.
Considerable animosity has been mani
fested by the litigants, and it is thougiu
the pending trial wi,l be no exception to
the rule tnat family disputes are the bit
terest to be found in the annals of litiga
ticn.
$IAUD EDNA HALL RETURNS.
Tho Popular Attress Will Play Lead
ing Koles at Morocco's.
There has been a flatter of excitement
about the Grand Opera-house during the
past two days. Maud Edna Hall has re
turned. |
Miss Hall played leading roles at the
Grand two years ago. During two seasons
she was the idol of the big opera-house,
and her departure for New York to take
Mary Hampton's place in Charles Froh
man's "Sowing tne Wind" road company
was a signal ior much regret.
Mis 3 Hampton had won a reputation in
; the leading part of ''Sowing tbe \Y:nd,"
- and Miss Hall took tue same part mosi
effectively.
Miss Hall will remain at Morosco's un
til September. Mr. FroUman has offered
her an increased salary to resume her
work in "Sowing the Wind" next season,
and if she accepts she will probably play
in that production till January, when she
may take up the leading role in '"Under
â¢ he* Red Robe."
Only Wedded One Week
The casa of Eddie Kline, the "subject" of |
the Pacific Hypnotic Institute arrested for j
vagrancy, was dismissed by Judge Campbell !
yesterdar as the boy has go..c back home and j
is behaving himself. Thts wife of Dr. 11. W. '
Thornton of the institute, married but a week i
ago, has left him and gone back to her mother, i
The "Dr." has sent a lawyer to her and ex
presses a willingness to give her a divorce if
she waats it.
A Press Club Affair.
There was a most enjoyable evening's in

Week for us. The people were with us from early Monday
morn till 11 o'clock last night.
SPRING CLOTHING, HATS AND FURNISHING GOODS
! 1 WENT OFF OUR KIGH-PILED COUNTERS AND SHELVES AS THOUGH BY MAGIC.
The many " FAKE SALES about town only served to bring
out in bold relief the true magnitude of our great, bona fide
and mighty SACRIFICE SALE of the finest grade goods ob-
tainable in this country.
Any Man With a Fat or Lean Pocketbook,
It doesn't matter which, if he be a lean man with a fat pocketbook,
' or a fat man with a lean pocketbook, we can fit either man accord-
ing to his physical as well as his financial capacity with a stylish
Suit or Overcoat that 11 put him on good terms with himself and
} everybody else for many moons to come.
I There is a Reason for Everything.
'i The reason we are now giving our fine goods away at about
HALF THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE is because we have but a short
time here at our TEMPORARY QUARTERS in which to turn our
mammoth stock into cash. We have got to quit our present quarters
next month, hence must close out our goods at once regardless of
all loss. . . . : . -
THIS "WEEK:
Men's $12 50 All-wool Suits must go at $6.50
Men's $13.50 All-wool Suits must go at 7.50
Men's $17.50 All-wool Suits must go at 9.50
Child's $4.00 All-wool Suits must go at 1.95
Child s $5.00 All-wool Suits must go at 2.45
Boys' $8.50 All-wool Suits must go at 4.95

â  â  CITIZENS OF SAN FRANCISCO .AND SURROUNDING COUNTIES : Ibis Phenomenal anil Bona Fide Sale should
tot. be missed, as a posiiivs suing of from 35 to 50 per cat can surely be effected. ; ..

MRS. NASH,
CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM.
This celebrated medium, the clairvoyant of all
clairvoyants, who sees it all, tells you all and in-

ask a question, but before you utter a word I tell
your name, names In full of all that you are inter-
ested In, all dates, facts, etc. I tell you who are
true to you and who are false, what hopes you
may have winning your desires and what obsta-
cles are In your way and how to remove them.
How to make the best of your talents and pros-
per. How to get money. I find lost articles and
locate hidden treasure. Before en'ering into busi-
ness, law, divorce or marriage consult me. Drive
away evil spells, stumbling blocks, bad luck and
habits, and overcome all evil woiks, rivals and
enemies. I never falL I have brought about
more happiness than all other mediums, others
are be helped: why not you? If you are going to
see a medium, why no see the very best? It costs
no more. Nothing to be paid in advance, and If
not entirely satisfactory nothing at all. Do you
desire anything fairer than that? Residence, 4.0

JUDGE OGDEN HAS
A BIG SURPRISE
A Hypnotized Jurr Re
turns a Verdict That
Is Not Satisfactory.
Ex-Judge Gibson's Plea for Sym
pathy Produced a Result
That Was Not Justifi 'd.
The Court Warmly Told the Jury He
Hoped They Wouli Not Suffer
by Such Verdicts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,),
903 Broadway, May 8. I
A jury in Judge Ogden's court this aft
ernoon brought down upon itself the in
dignation of the court because of a verdict
which appeared 10 be not at all justified
by the evidence.
Robert Lane has been on trial two days
for burglary. From the first it was fore
gone conclusion that Lane would be con
victed, as the evidence was so direct. To
add to his appearance of guilt Lane took
the witness->tand, and while testifying in
his own behalf yesterday stated that there
were no prior convictions against him.
The case proceeded to-day and the prose
cution put Lane on the stand again for
cross-examination. He then contradicted
himself and stated that he had already
been once conv'cted, and when asked why
he testified differently yesterday he re
plied that on a former occasion an attor
ney had told him never to admit a prior
conviction and he followed his advice.
Ex-Judge Gibson, Lane's attorney, has
done some noteworthy thing* in tue Ala
meda, County courthouse, but he never
before succeeded in hypnotizing a jury as
he did this afternoon. His speech on be
half of Lane contained very little,reference
to the lacts in the case, bat referred a
great deal to the hardships the prisoner
would have to suffer were he convicted.
His plea was not so ardent as usual and
everybody thought that counsel shared

Will of the Great High Priest
Catches Fire and Is Totally
Destroyed.
In lie Attempt lo Pat Out the FJames
'Cupid" P>.ck Is Seriousiy
Burned.
BERKELEY, Cal., May B.â ln a cloud
of smoke went up the will of the senior
dispensator at the class day exerc.ses of
ilie State University this afternoon, and
as a result tbe performance, to witness
which 50j0 people hail gathered, was an
almost complete failure. "Cupid 11 Peck,
a inamber of the graduating cla^-s, upon
whom the burlesque sacred rites of the
high priest were about to be conferred,
was seriously burned about the hands and
face, his flimsy linen gown having caught
fire from tiie incense at the altar.
What was probably the largest crowd
that ever gathered at the State University
to witness the farcical performance of the
seniors had scarcely become interesied in
the exerc:ses when the flames from the
altar of the high priest ignited the light
bunting which was draped about ihe
speaker's stand, and* before it could be ex
tinguished destroyed almost completely
the decorations, besiae burning the docu
ment the reading of which would have
furnished the central feature of the after
noon 's amusement.
The wiil ton ained the names of every
member of the class, witn a iew lines of
rhyme on each, setting forth one or more
of hia idiscyncrasiea and bequeathing to
him some memento, such as a bottle oi
soothing syrup, i uoi o: hairpins, a cake
of soa;>, a razor or some other trinket
characteristic of his nature.
The in roducioty performance, consist
ing of a motk Aziec iuneral march and a
few souks and local hits, had just takÂ«n
Dace when tne tire started. Ttie spread-
Ing of the flames, which was accelerated
by a gust of wi:;d, caused a temporary
panic among the audience seated abi-ui
in the natural ampn;thea;er, and during
the attenJan: flurry noionc; tne i erform
ers the precious papers were destroyed.
The classmen could do but little to put
out i he fire, for fear that in tiie attempt
their Lgtot and inflammable garments
would ignite.
The university pclice and some of the
spectators rushed to the scene and with
their coats and clubs beat out the blaze on
one side cf the stand. No soo.ier had
they finished in one place, when the
flames broke out in another. It was dur
ing ihe progress of the iatier lire that the
will was destroyed and Peck was burned.
Priest E. O. A.len tod the audience that
the document had been destroyed, ai.d
the pariormance could not go on. Then
ihe oiÂ£ crowd dispersed.
The morning exercises which consisted
principally of a pUgrimÂ»gÂ« of the campus
and speeches delivered from the various
buildings Wt-nt off smoothly, nothing of

the occasion.
The concert under the oaks was the first

CIEOULATING PETITIONS.
A >ew Phase of the Controversy Be

OAKLAND, Cal., May. 9.â A new ele
ment Das been injected into the fight be
tween the Contra Costa and Oakland
water companies. Yesterday a number of
solicitors, evidently in sympathy with
the Oakland Water Company, began cir
culating petitions on the streets and even
on the ferry-boat?. The petitions, which
were addressed to the City Council, read
as lollorrs: ijjii :â â â ;,. .

Thai the Contra Costa Water Company has
received thousands of dollars for placing
hydrants and k' eping them in repair and that
the Oakland Water Company' has never re

That the Oikiat d Water Company has not

money spent in placing hydrants; -that its

stored Hose to the city, at good elevation,
17.000.000 gallons of water in reservoirs for
use for tire purposes. ' Therefore,

BUILT A SHED FOR SPITE.
Peculiar Result of D mestic
Trouble Be'we^n Husband
and Wife.
Mrs. White MaJe H.r Will and Left
Her Property to a N.ece and
War Wr, D?c ared.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco CallJ
903 Broadway, May 8. f
Mr. and Mrs. Wtiae, who live at Thirty- I
seventh and Grove street?, have carried
their domestic difficulties to such a point j
that Mr. White has erect-d an unsightly i
shed close to his wife's home for the pur
pose of annoying her.
Where the Whites used to live and where
the lady still lives are several neat little i
cottages, with a lot between. They would j
attract no attention buc Uu the fact that
the ugly shed 19 placed right out to the j
front of the lot and close to the house.
Mrs. White is the owner of the larger of |
the two cottages. About three years ago '
things were not progressing smoothly, :
and she secured a division of the com- j
munity property. She took the house and
lot, and the vacant lot was included in her
husband's share.
Some time after the division of property
Mrs. White btcame ill, and believing that !
shs was about 10 die sue made her will. ,
She bequeathed tier Droperty to her niece,
a Mrs. Johnson, who at present lives with j
her. The knowledge flf this distribution '
of hor property became known to her hu3- :
band, and it so affected him that he wen:
off to try to forget his sorrow at being i
ignored.
About three weeks ago Mrs. White re- '
ceived information that tier husband was ,
preparing himself to make trouble when ,
he came home. She bolted berseii in the I
house ana White did not occupy his room
that night. 1 his was the winding up of
their living in the same bouse, and the !
next day White brought a few hundred i
ieet of lumber to the vacant lot and
erected the homeliest shed he could think !
of, af:er which he called his w fe'3 atten- '
tiou to it. It contains two windows and a
door and a place for a smokestack, and
White has never occupied it, but nas an- â 
nounced that it was erected for the pur- 1
pose oi proving an eyesore to his wife.

Now that the different doctors and of

manipulating in regard to the Health

that lie had not asked any one of the doc

THE FORCE OF
THE FUTURE
IS THE AIR
Another Great Achievement
of the Century An
nounced.
ATMOSPHERE CHEAPLY
LIQUEFIED.
â 
Discovery of a Simple and Safe
Process of Generating
Vast Power.
FROZEN AIR CAN BE RENDERED
PORTABLE.
The Power May Be App'.i'd to Propel
ling Cars ad Shipsâ Of Great
Advantage to Commerce.
One of the greatest discoveries in the
generation of power may Boon be an
nounced 10 the world.
It has been known for some months or
a year that Professor 1/1:1 de of Berlin nad
invented or solved a process of producing
at a low cost liquefied air. It was not
Known, however, until very recently that
Professor Trirpier, an eminent scientist
in New York, hits been conducting highly
successful experiments on the sums line
in his own laboratory in that city. An
unexpected mishap caused the direction
of public notice to the investigation.
The accident, of which a brief account
came by wire, happened in this wise. Pro
fessor Trippler brought to a hotel from
his laboratory station a mile distant a
small quantity of liquid air â air which
had been reduced to a temperature of 310
degrees below zero. A few drops of the
liquid was placed in a glass of alcohol.
The instant effect was the freezing of tne
alcohol. Among the men who had the
privilege of attending the experiment was
the Ã¼biquitous fool. and he had the inspi
ration to apply a lighted match to the
Jrozen substance.
A terrific explosion which shattered
much glassware and caused a deal of
alarm in the hotel was the immediate re
sult of the experiment with the match.
Subsequent investigation at his own
laboratory convinced the professor that
it wan the alcohol and not the air that
exploded.
Among the few men of the country who
have been posted from time to time on
the progress of experiments in liquefying
air is E. A. Pax of San Francisco, presi- '
dent of the R:x Compressed Air Ma
chinery Company. He was in New York
â when the foregoing incident occurred, but
was not present at the explosion of the
alcohol. Incidentally at a lecture which
lie delivered at Stanford University last
Monday night mention was made of the
explosion.
Facts now brought to light show clearly
that the experiments with liquefied air in
the United States have progressed beyond
those made in Germany, and that the
credit of the great invention may be given
to the scientists of the New World.
Professor Trippler is very reticent con
cerning his discoveries, but ha is confident
that the liquefied air can be retained in
cylinders or storage reservoirs occupying
small spaces and be used readily as power
to propel machinery.
Liquefied air may be described as 700
cubic feet of atmosphere condensed into
one cubic foot. Tne temperature of the
substance may be reckoned as 700 degrees
below zero. In appearance it resembies
water, and to the touch feels like mercury,
It may be possible, as the result of the
New lorlr invention, for tremendous
power to be safely stored in a small
cylinder.
The purpose of the New York inventor
is to complete the process of generating
and applying the power before others shall
step in and wrest the discovery from him.
The invention in its usefulness to man
kind may fall but little below the inven
tions of steam ana electricity.

May number, from the Department of
Stale bureau of statistics, dated Washing

"Fluid Air ior Industrial Uses," written
by Charles de Kay, Consul-General, dated
Berlin, Marcn 11, 1597, as follows:
FLUID AIR FOR INDUSTRIAL USES.
Liquefying air is not a new thing. It has
been performed by exerting enormous pres
sure, or by freezing air to an unusual degree,
or by a combination of pressure with refrig
eration. There Â«re bo many uses to which
liquefied air can be put that scientists hardly
know where its usefulness will end it it can be
produced at a low rate of cost in commercial
quantities.
Among other advantages air in the portable
cheap form of a Mould as it passes back to its
ordinary state can be used for illuminating

Hitherto the classic example of a method to
liquefy air and obtain oxygen _jas in
\e:itedby Beatty an.l Cailleieiiu Is-.. >Mth
their machine one began with carbonic acid
eas. By means of a pump this gas was con
' densed'in a tubo round which lay water at 10
degrees tÂ«> keep the tube cool. The carbonic
. acid gas, be ins reduced to a very low tempera
ture, passed irow : lie Brst tube into another
chamber with â  tub - ;:i It and m so doing Ml
i to â  lower tempeiature. Into this second tube
was pumped at high prtv-sur.- ethylene gas.
: which in turn tell to a low teui perature, owing
to the coldness of the carbonic acid gas bath
â  ing the tube. The etnylene gas was then
passed from the second tube into a third com
partment und feli further in temperature in so
doing. The third compartment had likewise
j a tube with an alrpurap nunched. Into this
. third tube was pumped oxygen gas aiid from
i the ethyiene gas bathing it th<> oxygen gas
: reached a temperature oi 192 degrees belov
zero. Finally, the ox Â»gen was let out into a
! fourth compartment, in which was h fourth
! tube. Tiie airpump attached to ihis fourth
i tube hi.ving liilecJ it with condensed atmo.s
--| pheric air the latter wÂ»s to reduced in temper
' ature that whet: it in turn via* re eaaed from
| the tube it= tempera! nre was 273 degrees be
! low zero and it appeared in the iorm of drops
: like water.
This product, which is call.nl liquid or fluid
j air, has a mi.ky appearance from the pres
j ence of some carbouic-ac.d gas, bubbles ron-
I stÂ«rt!y, and from its enormous cold emits a
â¢â¢- rioud, like the topof a very Inch
â .. Â and wiW OLiy gradually resolve
i..Â». 1; HÂ»;ain into air when exposed to the ordi
i nary atmosphere.
Fluid air oosig about 10 marks (say $2 25)
for five cubic meters reduced. The new
method is the invention of Prof essor LiDde of
I Munich. It produces the liquid for 10 pfen-
I nigs (say 2 L i cents) ior five cubic meter?, and
; It yields toe product either as a i;as or Ilui-1 as
J one wishes. This is one Of the most ingenious
pieces of mechanism known. Its chief fea-
I lure is its economy of working, for it uses air
| to refrigerate air. After the pump has worked
for a certain time oiie turns a cock and the
liquid air runs out at a temperature of 273 de
; grees beiow zero.
In Professor Linde's method an airpump
. of five horsepower condenses air to a pressure
i of 200 atmosphere--. This Hir pusses down a
! spiral tube and is let out in a cnamoer, caus
-1 ing great cold; then it rises and pas:-es on ttie
' outside of the spiral tube, bathing it and thus
coolina the new air Â»hat has been pumped into
the tube to take its place. This cooled air fol
; lows on into the chamber, expands and
again lowers its atmospnere, then passes on
up around the same spiral tube; but as its
, temperature has become much lower the new
! air in the tube is still further refrigernted.
This circulating process goes oa an til (be new
air pumped into the tube reaches tne expan
. sion chamber at a temperature of 273 degrees
below zero, when it drops into the chamber in
| the torm of liquid. Thus the air, steadily
cooled, is made to reiriuerate the newly
pumped air more and more until the necessary
| degree of cold is attained.
Another idea, wnich may or may not be an
: improvement, is to have the pump aud all
, parts of the machine kept very iow in ter
nâ¢ perature.
Air, in the cheap, portable form of a liquid
i rich in oxygen, can be used ior many purposes
i in manufactures and the trades. The discov
; cry of a cheap method may be of importance
i to American manufacturers.
Mr. Rex of San Francisco.who delivered
' the lecture at Stanford University last
: Monday night, is fully advised of the
; great progress made by the German
scientists, but does not hesitate to assert
, that stiil greater yirosress has been made
, hi New York. Within a few weeks, pos
: sibly some time this month, a definite
statement, expressed in scientific ttrms,
: may convey to ttie public all the import
i ant facts relating to the new discovery.

deavor Union was held yesterday after
noon at the First Christian Church, on
Twelfth street, between Mission and How
ard. President James Blair presided.
The secretary, Charles Stain bridge, gave
a summary of the work done during the
past quarter. It showed an encouraging
gain of unions and members. There are
now fifty unions with 1300 members in
the two branches of the Endeavorers,
which shows a gain during the past quar
ter of eighteen societies.
Miss Myrtle Simpson, the general super
intenddntof the union for the City, gave a
brief but very interesting account of her
labors in the cause.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
Samuel M. Shortridge to Wed Miss Laura Leigh Gashwiler.
An interesting engagement just made public is that of Samuel M. Shortridge and Miss
Laura Leigh Gashwiler. While the announcement was not altogether a surprise, still it was
unexpected and important enough to bo society's main topic of conversation yesterday.
Miss Gashwiler is the daughter of the late John W. Gashwiler, prominently identified with
the early mining interests of the State, She is a native daughter and one that both her City â
San Franciscoâ and her State are justly proud of. In appearance she is an ideal type of a Gib
son girl, with that dash of ruddy health and buoyant spirits which distinguishes California's
fair daughters. Her beauty, combined with her rare mental attainments, has made her a
delightful companion and a worthy helpmeet for a distinguished fiance.
This fair bride to be was primarily educated in a convent here; later in the seminary of
the Ladies of the Sacred Heart iv Manhattanvillc, N. V., then at tne Sacre Coeur in Pari.-, and
finally in San Francisco, where she graduated from Hiss Lake's School in 1892. After her
graduation Miss Gashwiler spent two years abroad in company with her mother, her sister,
Miss Charlotte, and her brother. Since her return to California the serious illness of Mrs.
Gashwiler has deprived society of one of its fairest blossoms iv the person of the fair young
fiancee.
Mr. Shortridge is a lawyer of recognized ability and an orator of distinction. Although
not a native son â having been born in lowaâ he knows but little of any other home, and all
his interests are Californian. He is the son of the late Rev. Elias W. Shortridi^e, and a brother
of Charles M. Shortridge.
Although no definite data has been set for the wedding of this distinguished young couple,
it is definitely understood that it will be celebrated lato in the summer.
"BUSINESS WAS
NEVER BETTER"
So Says Premier Sedden
Concerning New
Zsaland.
Single-Tax Leaders Interview
Him on the Effect of
Exemption.
The Government That Inaugurated It
K?pt in Power Longer Than
Any Other in History.
Premier Sedden of New Zealand de
parted for the East last evening, continu
ing his journey to London and the Queen's
jubilee. He was entertained on Friday by
John D. Spreckeis, who took him on a
tour of the bay in a tug. Yesterday he
gave a luncheon at the Occidental, among
his guests being A. Cbesebrough, Clans
Spreckels, C. Reid, Hugh Craig, Dr.
Buckley, L. F. Cockroft and Walter Gib
son. Ho took the 5 o'clock train for the
East.
During the forenoon yesterday Joseph
Leggett and James S. Reynolds, by ap
pointment, paid the Premier quite an ex
tended visit. Mr. Legmen had letters from
Consul Connolly of New Zealand.
New Zealand is a land that the single
! taxers hold up as an object lesson of their
j faith.it having advanced somewhat further
along the line they are pointing out than
any other country, and Messrs. Lcggett ,
and Reynolds, leaders of the movement in
this State, desired to learn from the head
of the Government the effect of the legis
lation upon the social condition of the
country and the sentiments of the people
at present concerning it.
They were especially desirous to know
what the prospect was, if any, for the re
peal of that clause of the law which ex
empted land to the amount of Â£500 from
taxation, a provision which the single
taxers, of course, think a iul-e and very
unfortunate step. They asked the Pre
mier if there was any movement at pres
ent in the direction of it.- repeal.
Mr. Sudden promptly replied, "No,
there is not." "But," he said, "we, Mr.
Baliance and myself, were compelled to
yield that much, in order to secure the
support necessary to carry through the part
of our schemeâ to exempt personal prop
erty and improvements on land to toe
amount of Â£3000. . .
"As there was a larger number of per
sons owning Detween Â£200 and Â£500 worth
of land their opposition would have been
fatal. This exemption was not a part of
the original plan, but, as stated, was
forced upon us." T&A&i'*
In the last session of the Parliament
which expired last year an act was passed
giving to certain municipalities the power
to adopt what has come to be called by
single taxers in this country local option
in taxation, â  under which a majority of
electors of the municipality may oy popu
lar vote determine whether or not they
will exempt personal property and im
provements from taxation.
Although manhood and womanhood suf
frage prevails for the general election for
members of Parliament, a property quali
fication is fixed for municipal elections.
Mr. Sedden was asked how this fact
would affect the likelihood of a proposi
tion to exempt personal property and im
provements from taxation being adopted.
In reply he said:
"I can only say that in the very first
municipality where the question was sub
mitted â that of Palmerston, Northâ it
; carried."
> In his quaint, practical way Mr. Sedden
i undertook to explain. '^ZtW^'f+f^^
"Here is a block," lie said, "containing
several allotments. Some are well im
proved and some not so well, and some
others wholly unimproved. The land
throughout the block is equally valuable,
and so we assess it equally by the front
foot. â '/â¢< â â - ''â  â â¢' ' : : "'- â  ' â ?Â«
"Now some whose allotments are un
improved or but poorly improved may
have been paying three-halfpence ; they
.will now have to pay more, sÂ»j three- ,
I pence. But those whose allotments have
been better improved will have much less
to pay than they did before. And this is
right, because you ought not to penalize
| a man for making good improvements."
In the first Liberal Parliament elected
in 1890, and while Ballance was Premier,
the leader of the Conservative opposition
conceived the plan of compassing the de
feat of the Liberal Ministry by forcing
through a bill granting the suffrage to
women.
Mr. Sedden, then a member of the
Baliance Ministry, was opposed to
woman suffrage and spoke against the
bill on its second reading. After the sec
ond reading Premier Baliance concluded
it was necessary lor the Government to
adopt the measure in order to avoid de
feat, which would necessitate their resig-
I nation from office.
Mr. Seaden yielded reluctantly with
the understanding that ho should be per-
I initted to absent himself from attendance
on the evening that the vote was to take
place. Before that time arrived, however,
Premier Baliance was stricken with
the illness with which ne soon after
ward died, and Mr. Sedden became Acting
Premier, and was compelled to go before
the house and himself advocate and carry
tbrongn '.he Dill against which he had
spoken ajon the second reading.
During the campaign which came on
soon after the Conservatives made a tierce
attack on M r. Sedden and the Liberals and
appealed to the women to vote against:
toe Liberals, Ttie appeal, however, was
unsuccessful. The women voted chiefly
as did their father- and brothers on their
first exercise of tne franchise, and tho re
sult was simply a doubling of the vote,
the Liberals being returned by an in
creased majority.
At the election last year, however, the
women pursued a different course. They
got up meetings of their own and insisted
that the candidates address them. They
studied the questions and determined to
vote for their own interests and the inter
ests oi their children and to nullify the
vote of the "Jumpers" â that cluss of
voters who are ready to vote for anybody
who would give them a mug of beer.
Their votes were cast largely for tho
Liberal candidates and a substantial
majority of supporters of the Sedden Gov
ernment were in consequence returned.
This is the third successive election won
by the Liberal?, a thing which never before
occurred iv the history of the Govern
ment.
"What is the present industrial and
business condition of your colony; will
you tell us in a few words?" was asked.
The prompt and emphatic reply was:
"It was never better."
The worst thing that can happen to a
man in Biam is to get into debt, owing to
the exorbitant interest charged.

READY TO START
THE BIG COLONY
Major Winchell Expects to
Touch the Button in
a Few Days.
The Boulevard Being Completed
Committee Will Concentrate
on This Work.
It Will Form an Obj ct. Lesson for
tbe Christian Endeavorers
in July.
Wltb the completion of Balboa boule
vard the forces at work along the lines
for which that big enterprise was under
taken will concentrate upon the coloniza
tion scheme which is being perfected by
the S.ilvation Array.
The permanent committee appointed
by the president of tte Chamber of Com
merce committee includes two men whose
time is now largely taken up in securing
funds for the boulevardâ W. M. Bunker
and L. 11. Eilert â and until that is com
pleted they rind themselves unable to
give the necessary attention to the
greater and more permanent work which
it will require.
That is not to say that there has been
any particular pause in the preliminary
work leading up to the establishment of
the colony, for the real work has not
begun. Major Winchell has been busy
; every hour of every day and has person
ally .id justed things and effected arrange
ments that will leave only the button to
be touched in order to put the machinery
in motion when the word is given. He
! confidently expects the big colony to be
| solar advanced by July that it will serve
as one of the chief attractions and object
lessons to the Christian Endeavorers wuen
they overrun the City in July.
"The location we liave aboutdetermined
upon," said Major Winchell last evenine,
"is the Walker estate, some ten miles this
side of Santa Kosa. It embraces Ã¼boui,
2000 acres. We hope to get an option on
this land at a reasonable figure. That is
the first essential step. To begin with,
however, we do not want to make this
colony, which is to be a model, too big,
I nor yet too little. We propose to at first
I put 120 families on a section of the land â
| t)4O acres. Each family will have rive
' acres, which will cover GOO acres. Tbe
forty acres will be reserved in the center
of the tract for a general farm or gather
i ing- place. The products of this will go
| toward the support or relief of our insti-
I tutions.
"Here will be built the general meeting
i hall, the *c:iool, the creamery, the
grocery-store, the bank and blacksmith
shop. In ihe school we will seek to give
as good an education as may be secured
in the City.
"Having tried our powers and gained
experience, we will permit the colony to
grow, to stread out over 1000 acres aud
thej the 2000.
"We will be very careful in selecting
those who are to form the initial con
tingent, for upon them depends largely
the ultimate success.
"We have watched the workers at the
boulevard and our selection will be made
from among those who showed an earnest
disposition to work. Thee who form
the colony must be imbued with the de
sire to make life â tbe best that is in life â
an object rither than the accumulation of
dollar?. We expect to call a mas^-meet:
ing and begin thÂ« real work of securing
mnds to establish the colony in a few
days. We need ?25,000, ana 1 exuec: that
Bum to be raised in ten Hays."
LATEST SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY.
The latest discovery in the scientific
world is NARCOTIZED AIR for the
Painless Extraction of TEETH. It is ab
solutely safe, and more than 250, 000 suc
cessful administrations last year by the
leading surgeons and dentists of Europa
stamp it as tbe coming narcotic of the
age. Dr. T. H. "Morris in the Phelan
buildingâ rooms 28-30-32-34â San Fran
cisco, whose past reputation and success
ful practice place him as one of the lead
ing dentibtn in this City, is the only local
dentist who administers the NARCOT
IZED air. Hundreds of his patients who
have had teeth painlessly extracted are
living testimonials as to its worth and ef
ficiency. Dr Morris makes a specialty of
TEETH without Plates, Bridge-work,
Gold and Porcelain Crowns, and he does
not wish to be known as competing with
Cheap Dental Establishments, but with
tirst-cla3s dentists at half their prices.
A set of Teeth for $10; the bent that can
be made. My former prices $15 and $20.
Extractions 50 cents, and all other work
in proportion. *
Bloomer's Cryptograph Estate.
The will of John Godfrey Bloomer, who died
November iiU, has been filed for probate. It

Augusta Bloomer. His estate consists of real

unknown value, and three literary produc
tions known as "Bloomer's Commercial Cryp

On Friday, May 28 the schools of the
entire State will celebrate Lincoln day.
State Superintendent of Schools Black has
â¢ officially indorsed Che movement inaug
urated by the Lincoln Monument Leazue,
snd edccational leaders all ovar the United
States have written a hearty approval of
ire movement.
Early in April the San Francisco Board
of Education adopted a resolution ordering
the obse;vaice of the day and appointing
President of the Beard Barrington. Super
intendent Webster and Directors Waller,
Rs~an and Head to assist the Isagae in
. car:; oat the programme. Tiie mc
ample was followed by the Boards of Ed- j
ucation of Oakland, Alameda and sur- j
rounding bay cities.
: This prompt indorsement of the patriotic
'action or ocr City School Board gave the
, idea an impetus, and in a s ort time the
State had swung into line.
Very few public movement? can boa of
the. phenomenal rise of this Lincoln day.
Not yet two months ago the proposition |
\ was. starte-l in a meeting of Lincoln Post
â¢in this City; to-day not a State in the
Union has failed to respond to the senti
ment. That this is so shows the deep-roote .
affection of the American people for the !
"Great Liberator," as President McKinley
aptly terms the great war President.
Yesterday Professor Ehsha Brooks, prin
cipal of the Girls' High School and chair
mar. of the committee of the league on

if Dear until We are all children of I
one family aad Abraham Lincoln is the father.
i This was the inspiration that moved your
I delegates at" the Salinas Encampment to in
-1 dorse a resolution looking to tne erection of a j
â  ! Visible token of the abiding affection of the
| Grand Army of the Republic for its beloved.
. I chief. â  The Lincoln Monument League has
â  j been adopted as the foster child of the Grand
i Army oi the Republic, and it should be the
: proud privilege ox every comrade to enroll
i himself as a member. The monument to be
â  erected to Abraham Lincoln Is not a local :
affair; i: is to be a tribute of the comrades :
everywhere to tiie love we bear to the memory
pf the martyr President. We ask eÂ«ch post to I
j appoint an energetic organizer who will act as !
| a recruiting sergeant. We have had certificates j
i of meinb-.Tshiii bound into books of fifty each, '
and we wish to send these books to every post :
on the coast. Each certificate is attached to a
1 stub. Write the name of the member on the
stub and on the certificate.
j The entrance fee is 25 cents. There will be
! no further . expense. Go after your city or
! county editor ana have him publish the roster '
I of your league; ho wi.i be glad to do it as an I
i item of news. Go to your schools and tell the :
teachers that the State Superintendent of
â  schools has issued an official request that
1 every scnool celebrate Fridiy, MaÂ» 23. as Lin
coln day. On that day let every school in the
whole country be visited by Grand Army
( veterans.
It mignt be well for your organizer to leave
: a certificate- with every school principal
i and in some popular store where patriotic
citizens can get a chance to become members J
I of the league. Interest the school-children in j
I the matter; they are vigorous recruiting !
â  officers. Let your loyal women have a hare j
| of your labor and your glory; let them get up
! lectures and league concerts, with certificates
j as tickets of admissiou. Scad the name of |
; your organizer to the quartermaster a: de- !
i partment headquarters. If you know of any ;
j active public citizen who would interest him- ;
self, send his name also.
Certificates, school circulars and other â 
I printed matter can be obtained of Eugene ;
Wiegand. quartermaster of the league, depart- :
j meat headquarters. Send your stubs back
with the money to Eugene Wiegand.
My comrades, show by your interest in this ;
matter that your patriotism is a thing of life. \
i not wholly a memory oi the past. Frater- '

Deaf. Sib: I am deeply interested in every
thing that tends to exalt the name of Lincoln. '
Of ail our public men. irom first to last, he is
:he cne who comes nearest to the people, and
the on? who most truiy represents the true
spirit of America. I should by no means m*ke
any excptiou in either of these regards in
favor oi Washington or any one else. Lincoln
is the wisest, kindliest and most unselfish of
all our public mea. But perhaps the very fact
that he is so universally recognized by our
people may stand in the way of building a
monument. His monument wiii always be in
the hearts of men, and no amount of stone
would be more enduring.
With the fur seals and the university I have
far too much on nar.dnow to write anything for
you for publication this weeiâ unless out of
what I have just said you can use s methiag.
Very truly yours, _ Pavtd 8L Jordan.

Abraham Lincoln as a J4ar\.
Yon do not know the quality ot the
black mud bottom of our ponds till you
have Sren the white water lily which it
sends up into the light. You do not
know the grandeur of our flat country till j
it lifts its head iv some towerinz oak or
elm. And you cannot guess the hidden
strength of our democracy till you see it
rise pure and majestic iv the person of
Abraham Lincoln.
The early settlers of Indiana and llli- i
nois shunnei the prairie lands and chose
the woods for tneir homes. They would
not trust the fertility of soil that did not :
bear tall trees. But later settlers found
that the prairies were as rich ai the wooded
lands. So the nations of Europe had no
faitn in democracy. Bat those who knew
our American people best guessed at the ;
greatness nid in its broad stretches of
monotonous commonplace. Abraham Lin- j
coin appeared, coming from those prairies j
o! the West, and the world learned at last !
what our democracy means.
There have Deea kings and queens
whose position was so exalted that eti
quette forbade them to speak to trades
men whose coeds they bought. Suca !
majesty exists even down to this present
day. But t;e time came wr.en those same
exalted monarciis found one lower than a
tradesman, a day laborer, in fact, taking
his place among the ruiers of the earth.
Tbeii great Erabassadors were accredited
to him. He exchanged courtesies and en- i
tered into negotiations with them on be- '
halt of one of the greatest powers. When !
his course was run they awoke at last to
the fact that he not only nad been one
with them, but the greatest of them all.
But this is not the best we may say of ,
him. His high position did not make !
him great. He was greater than his posi- ;
tiou. Weak men are made proud by pro
motion. He waÂ« made humble. Cheap
men stop to admire themselves and think
how great they are. He thought of the'
preat new duties laid on him and sought !
how he might discharge them fai&fully |
and welL If ue showed the world the great
ness of the common people, it was that .
his virtues were the virtues of common !
lite. Honesty, faithfulness and common- j
sense; kindness, good-humor, readiness;
to learn ; trust in Gca and in his fellow- j
i men, without over-contidence in himself, .
I these are qualities the common people '
know and love. Having these he had the
I people with him. Ihev followed him as
I if obeying tne voice of their own con- :
' science.
Other nations may tell us of heroes who i
1 were great in wars of conquest, masters of |
| diplomacy, creators of new parties and
| policies. We will join with them in Don- !
oring whatever is truly great in those
heroes of theirs. We will rejoice in great- j
ness and goodness wherever it may be |
! found. But we hold our land to be thrice ;
I bies-ea in that its heroes have been men
\ who were great because they carried com- j
j mon virtues into ereat affairs and used ;
I great abilities for the common eood. Such '
j was the glory of our great commoner, our
emancipator and martyr, Abraham Lin- '
coin.
j\ Local Lincoln Incident
W. E. Bartaofow is an enthusiastic
officer of the Lincoln Monument League.
He nas a book of certificates of raember
â¢nip always with him, and when he goes
out to order a bill of goods he drtws his
certificate- book oat very insinuatingly
toward the clo3e of proceedings, and no
one is abie to stand the look of utter
horror that com s like a blighting cloud
over his face at any sign of hesitation in
indorsing ihe plan. The other day Mr.
Bartholow was paying a bili of groceries,
ana as he foldei up his receipt he took
hia certificate- book out and opened it to
the admiring gi ,ze of the grocer. The
grocer is a man of fjniily and took six cer
tificates, one for every member of his
family.
While this was gome on a Mr. Kelly
came in and became interested in the con
versation, and said:
"Just g ye me four of those; here's $1. I
want to belong to the Lincoln League; ao
do my wife and girls."
Mr. Barthoiow took the money and
wrote the names of Mr. Kelly and his
family on the certificates, and then went
home.
About an hoar afterward he wa3 seated
at his table, dining and teding his wife of
his recruiting experience. In the midst
of the meal the doorbell rang suddenly
and in a very imperative sort of way, and
Mr. Bartholow hastened to trie door,
expecting to hear that the big brick build
ing down at Fourth and Tjwnseud streets
had fallen aown and buried his spring
overcoat.
He opened the door and there stood Mr.
Kelly with a flushed face. '-Mrs. Keily
made me come down and tell you that I
nad forgotten the biby! Tnere! here's
your two bits. MaKe me out a certificate
for Miss Marguerite J. Kellv, so that I can
go back and get my dinner!' 1
And Marguerite, God biess her little
heart! has a certificate of membership in
the Lincoln Monument League, and may
she live to take her iittle ones on a basket
picnic with their grandma on the green
grass of the park. When that day comes
it will be a pleasant thought to look up at
the white shaft as it towers toward heaven,
and musingly say: "Well, well! think of
it; we're just about the same age."

The World's Shipping.
Truly, it is "Athanasius conir* mun
<ium" in the matter of shipping, and the
British empire is the Athanasius. Of all
the merchant marine oi the world, in ves
sels of 100 tons or more, about one-half is
under tne "meteor flag." The totals are
29.880 vessels and 25,614,089 tons, of which
11.5.50, or more than one-third of the yes
ses. and 13,359,026, or more than one-half
of the tonnage, are British. There is no
use, therefore, in instituting a companion
between British shipping and that of any
otner nation. The tir-st place is so indis
putably English that all competition must
be for the second and lower places.
In the totals of all kinds of vessels the
second place is at present easily held by
the United States. This country has 3215
vessels, of 2 234,72-5 tons. The nearest com
petitors are Norway, with 2902 vessels of
1,6Â«;9 485 tons; and Germany, with 1657. of
1,94 ;,7~>l. France comes nei', with 1157, of
1,1291575. Italy, Russia, Sweden and Tur
key nave each more than 1000 vessels, in
deed Sweden has more than France, but
none of them has nearly 1.000.00 C tonnage.
Further analysis of the figures gives
some interesting results. In the class of
wooden and composite steamers the United
States greatly >ads all, with 222, of 158.000
tons, against ISO of 41,384 tons in Japan,
t;.e nearest rival. Indeed in tonnage of
this class the United States outstrips even
the British empire, the latter having 402
vessels, but of only 108,036 tons. Of iron
steamers we have 249, of 390,794 tons, and
are surpassed by France and Germany in
both numbers and tonnage, and by Nor
way, Sweden and Spain in the former bat
not in the 'atter respect. Of steel steamers
we have 209, of 455,833 tons, and are sur
passed in both respects only by Germany,
Norway having more vessels bat less
tonnage. The totals of all steam craft in
the United States are, then, 6SO vessels of
1,005,459 tons. We are surpassed only by
Germany, with 954 vessels of 1,436.539
tons, and are approached only by Norway
in number of vessels, 638 and by France
in tonnage, 930,785. All the rest are far
behind.
In sailing craft of wood and composite
structure the United States leads the
world, surpassing even the British empire.
The figure. arÂ»: United S ates, 2511 ves
sels of 1,193,379 ton >: British empire (col
onies included), 2314. of 708,550 tons;
Norway, 2166, of 1,042,084 tons, and
the rest uowhere. In iron sailing
craft our sixteen, of 16,863 tons,
a-e so far behind Germany's 185, of
199, 4c-5 tons, as to be quite out of reckon
ing. We are also surpassed in both num
bers and size by France, Norway, Den
mark and Holland, and by Argentina and
italy in numbers, and jast equaled by
Sweden in numbers. Oar eight steel
sailing vessels of 19,024 tons, are
vastly distanced by Germany's fleet,
surpassed in numbers and tonnage by
the fleets of Holland, France, Italy
and Norway, and in numbers by those of
Argentina and Danmark. In tfie grand
total of ail kinds o> sailing craft the United
States leads all the world, excepting the
British empire, but it is closely pressed by
Norway, the ngnre= b*ing: United States,
2535 vessels of 1.229.260 tons, and Norway,
2264 of 1.142.984 ions. All the rest are

DE WOLF HOPPER CAUGHT IN THE ROLE OF A BOOK FIEND
De Wolf Hopper is better known to his intimates as an ardent book
collector than as a comedian. But it does not comport with the gener
ally accepted iaea of a funny man that he loves booksâ old, rare and
curious tomes, tho older and rustier the better. Comicalities are Hopper s
trad ; book collecting is his diversion. With him on his travels he
carries his favorite books in a sort of portable bookcase built after the
plan of Napoleon's bookchest which he carried witn nim upon his cam
paigns. When this trunk is well filled he ships his garnerin'ps to his
New York home and then commences a new raid upon the old-book
stores. And there is not an old-book shop in the United States that he
has not ransacked for rare volumes treating of the stage, sport and
literary curiosities. When I called upon the comedian he had just
returned from a foray among the old-book stores of San Francisco. From
the size of the bundle I surmised that some of our worthy booksellers bad
enhanced their bank account* and were correspondingly happy. A child
with a basket of toys at Christmas time could hardly have displayed
greater pleasure and enjoyment than the comedian scanning the pages of
his new-found treasures.
Hopper has in mind to organize what he proposes to call the "Book
lifters' Protective Association." How natural that a comedian should
turn even his bobby into a merry jest! "Having for many years," said
be to me the other day when scanning the varied delights of his bookchest
"cultivated my leisure not alone in the perusal but in the seductive
chase of books, it has often been suggested to me by my confederates to
compile a quasi constitution of the principles underlying our pursuit so
that the results of my experience might not be entirely lost to them and
their successors.
"Ordinarily, a non- book-collector, as you no doubt have observed, if
you show sufficient surprise and enthusiasm at the fact that he possesses
b rare and valuable book will give it to you. If he does not give it to you
he may sngpest to you to take it home as a loan. If you are a conscien
cious 'book-keeper' the chances are that he will never see it again. If his
phlegmatic bosom is not moved to present it to you outright â or to loan
itâ the next step laid down by the chivalry of book-collecting is to sug
gest a trade. This may give you the long-looked-for opportunity of dis
posing of that worthless book which you subscribed for out of charity for
the woe-begone condition of a soliciting wiaow, whose face was a woodcu
of sorrow and her perseverance abnormally developed.
"There is a law of book-collecting which should always be and pen]
erally is observed â never to try any of these rules of the craft upon a fel
low member. The truth that 'in unity there is strength' should not be
lost sight of in this instance. TherA should always exist between book*
garnerers that gracious courtesy and respect for each other's rights which
never tempt the thief to employ his arts against a fellow. Another reason
or this rule is one based upon expedienceâ it will generally be found
mile to attempt it.
"The occasion may comeâ and if you are an insidious practitioner it
surely willâ when the owner of the loaned volume (a rare first or an ex
hausted edition) will arise in his wrath and demand back the book. If
the demand is too vehement to ignore, then yon can supply its place â
asserting, of course that it is lostâ by Â»ome volume 01 pretentious or
spurious merit. In fact, this modus operandi is the favorite one practiced
by the seeker of books out of print. The writhing victim is fortunate in
deed if his demand, oft repeatedâ a first demand should never be recog
nizedâmeets with this material but makeshift restitution.
"Where it is not advisable to borrow and the acquisitivene=s of the
owner will never permit him to be provoked into giving, study your vic
tim's movements, call when he is out and flatter his wife. Then borrow,
but never more than one book, and the chances are it will never be missed*
FLEW TWO HUNDRED MILES WITHOUT RESTING.
SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRUEST FORM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, BY JOHN BONNER
President Gilman of the Johns Hopkins I
University at Baltimore contributes to
tne Mny Cosmopolitan a valuable paper
on the inauguration of the new university
of Paris, which is desicned to be the su
preme effort of one of the most intelligent
peoples in the world in higher education.
When France began to recover from the
Ktun^ing shock of 1870-71 enlightened
Frenchmen realized that the triumphs of
the German army were due not wholly to
German prowess, but in a large measure to
defects in French education. They awokÂ«
to the truth that the foundation of na
tional strength and progress was wide
spread knowledge and a high standard of
moral and mental culture. The "colleges"
with which France was studded neither
turned out scholars nor manly men. Edu
cation was a failure, partly because the
science of pedagogy was unknown.
France was full of intellectual giants, en
dowed wifh great eifts. but they did not
beem to have the knack of generating a
race of virile Frenchmen. Attempts to
cure the error followed swiftly on the
heels of its discovery. Albert Dumont,
director of higher education, established
at the Sorbonne a new course on the
science of education, and the teachers and
students at the Lycees were encouraged to
attend. His efforts, seconded by those of
M. Bertbelot, culminated in a plan for
radical reforms, which, after discussion
A seagull has recently been watched,
under the most favorabla conditions,
while it performed a feat which caused
mariners to wonder and landsmen to gos
siD. According to whatever knowledge
has previously existed concerning the
habits and powers ot gulls the exploit in
question in unprecedented.
The gull flew 250 miles, by night and by
day, through clear weather and through
fog, through wind and comparative calm,
pursuing a seemingly purposeless adven
ture and abandoning it just at the time
when reward might have been in view.
W. H. Hammon, local forecast official of
the United States Weather Service, tells
the story. He was a passenger on the
steamer Pomona, which left San Fran
cisco, bound for Eureka, on a recent after
noon.
When the steamer was off the bar there
came sliding into viewâ literally sliding,
or coasting â a seagull with one leg
broken. The injured limb hung down,
while the other was closely curled up
under the gull's body. The broken leg
was sufficient to identify the bird.
When the Pomona T\as headed up the
coast on came the bird with a character
istic shrill scream, sometimes flying and
sometimes coasting. After circling around
the steamer for a time it took up a posi
tion almost over the vessel, and there it
hung, as if suspended by an Invisible wire.
Seagulls are so common that for some
hours no one paid any especial attention
to the bird. But after it had performed
an extraordinary feat of "coasting," in
which it maintained its position against a
I cad wind for twenty minutes at a time,
without once perceptibly moving or
changing the position of its wings, Mr.
Hammon, who is a keen observer, be
came fascinated by the easy manner in
which the "gall was sliding up to Eu
reka," as he expresses it. In fact, there
seemed to be absolutely no difficulty for
the gull to coast naif an hour at a time,
looking nonchalantly at the foaming bil
lows, and always preserving distance, as
the military men might say, with the
precision of a file-closer.
Coasting on a smaller scale by gulls Is
commonly observed from the decks of the
local ferry- t)oats, but these gulls never are
seen to coast more than two or three
minutes without resuming the active use
of their wings. What the ocean flyer did
was considered most remarkable by Mr.
Karamon, who declares that now the
question is determined as to whether a
and experiment, was embodied in a law
in 1893, and this law was amended and
irop~oved in sn act which was passed in
1894.
In August of that year a congress of
educators was beld at Havre and was at
tended by the foremost men In France,
including President Faure. The statistics

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
"If yon reside in a great city you should keeo a logbook of the effete
offspring of distinguished bibliomaniacs, and then seek the occasion of
either an acquaintance or a call. No doubt their parents have gathered
valuable books, volumes which you have sought after for years, heard of,
dreamed of, but have never seen, or if seen hardly hoped to possess. He
who is so fortunately situate! as to be near such a rich lead of true ore
will find himself like those who had the hardihood to get to these shores
in the lifteenth century or early sixteenth, trading glass beads for gold
nuggets. The aforesaid effete descendants will generally care nothine for
books, have little familiarity with the titles, and if you are dextrous in
etriki ng the right rib you may expect to sail many times to these shores
and depart thence without your bales of calico and gewgaws, bearing
away rich argosies. You have never thought, my fellows, how close to
your elbows are often the easy doors to cherished realizations.
"The book-collector should ever be hot upon the scent for presenta
tion copies. I know of a distinguished mem bar of our guild who const!"
tuted himseif an imagined historical and literary society, of which he
subscribed himself secretary and whose appeals (under his tpn.rious let
ter-head of the society) sent broadcast to distinguished living writers,
duly seasoned with hints of aid in books for this poor and struggling in
epeak in lower tones. We affirm less; we j
demonstrate; we show; we say to our |
student?, bear, see, judge."
This i 3 the truest form of higher educa
tion, which is simply self-education.
President Oilman well observes that the
end of education is not to choke the mind
with a farrago of u n relate 1 facts, but to
develop character. This cannot be done
with any curriculum, however cunningly
devised, for the minds of young men are
a- 1 different as their faces. One set of boys
will rebel against a course of study which
will delight and nurture another set. And
the evil is not altogether cured by the use
of our elective programme, for few youths
are competent, at the age when tbey enter
tbe university, to decide what seed will
germinate in their minds and what will
be dead. Tue president of Jobns Hop
kins thinks there should be in every uni
versity one or more persons specially ap
pointed to be the counselors and advisers
of students. They should be men of lib
eral culture, with special gifts for reading
character â "broad-shouldered men, of
good digestion, lovers of exercise in the
open air. capable of enlisting confidences
and keeping tbem; above all, men of
high moral and social character." It
should be the delight and duty of such
men to "inspire, guide, control, encour
age and counsel those who come under
their notice. 1 ' No professor with daily
stitution, resulted in his gathering a whole library of presentation copies
from too susceptible authors. This brother had a veritable Promethean
genius and no doubt will go througti the ages holding in the Olympus of
book-earnerers a place co-ordinate to that held in history by those em
balmed memories of the radical benefactors of the human race.
"A sleek and oily deacon â .1 prop and pillar of the churca â and not
the least ardent of our number, whose library was especially rich in fine
old bindings, was exceeded by no one I have ever met with in the gratis
acquisition of books. I believe that his talent lay mainly in being
close upon the heels of the undertaker. At these times this worthy
Christian was especially artful and full of gracious sympathy. I once at*
tended him by chance upon one of these missions of charity. Turning in
the most natural way imaginable to the shelf containing the coveted
volume, he drew it forth, remarking in soft and melting tones: 'How
often, my dear madam, has your lamented husband read to me from this
old book? It is indelibly associated in ruy mind with my many visits
under thia hospitable roof. I have uften thought he intended it for me as
a pledge and memorial of our friendship.' He generally had the coveted
book thrust upon him, however unwillingly he appeared to receive it.
"He was not one of your altruist book-lovers, a few of whom I have
gull ever makes a fl'ght of hundreds of
miles without interruption. There could
be no doubt of the identity of this bird
any more than there could be doubt of
Mr. Hamraon's perception. But of Mr.
Hammoa'i correctness in the following
we may be politely dubious.
"Of coarse, the movement of the steamer
forward caused a displacement of a cer
tain volume of air. This displaced air
flowed upward and served to buoy up th c
gull, which was about amidships of the
steamer and not far overhead. Gravita
tion naturally would have caused the bird
to fall but for the support which was thus
given it. With its outspread wings it had
a supporting surface to resist the down
ward tendency almost like a parachute in
effectiveness. In fact, placing its wings
at thÂ» proper angle the bird floated on
as easily as a parachute and then coasted.
Of course it did not matter particularly
whether the wings struck the air or the
air struck the wing?, speaking in a general
way. The air forced upward, the impetus
given by gravitation and the use of wings
Jike sails was sufficient to account for the
long coasting of the bird."
Such is Mr. Hammon's explanation.
It was clear weather when the Pomona
began its cruise northward, but Boon
afterward the fog caroe rolling in.
Sometimes the gull could be seen flying
overhead. When night closed in me bird
was still (here.
Now, every mariner with â whom the
writer of this article has talked ex
pressed the opinion that, while gulls
may fly all day, they are pretty sure to
rest on the water by night, although it is
well known that they Lava nocturnal
sight, and would have no difficulty in
pursuing their way on that score in the
darkness. But it now seems that this im
pression may be generally mistaken.
Heretofore, owing to the factthatone gull
looked like another, and no certain bird
could Le identified, this question has
never been settled.
When morning came the steamer was
far up the coast, going along steadily if
not very rapidly. When Mr. Hammon
came on deck at an early hour there was
the gull of the day before hanging still
over the steamer, sometimes using its
wings a little, but coasting more than
flying. It was seemingly as fresh as ever.
Occasionally it made its voice heard, very
lively asking in bird language for its
breakfast. Mr. Hammon called the atten
tion of other passengers to their-faithful
lectures and recitations to attend to could
find time to discharge the duty of mentor
to a thousand or more students. The duty
should devolve on members of the staff
detailed especially to discharge it, and the
more of them there are, if they are rightly
chosen, the better qualified the graduates
will be to take their proper place in life,
and to become "captains of men."
A bright boy who goes to a university
because his father thinks he should have
tbe best possible education is over
whelmed at the outset of his university
career by the embarrassment of his ricbes.
He may follow the regular curriculum,
which will probably benumb bis faculties,
and beguile him into tbe fatal babit of
allowing others to do his thinking; or he
may, in Oilman's words, fall back on
elective?, and lose himself in the thicket
of ologies. If he has been so fortunate as
to have passed some years at a good pre
paratory school, he will enter the uni
versity with a moderate stock of Latin and
Greek, Jinglisn, French and German, his
tory and geography. Which of these
paths to knowledge shall be pursue? In
Europe the "humanities" will command
tbe preference of the student who looks
forward to a professional or political
career. In this country yonng men ex
pec: to be meichants, or manufacturers,
or business or railroad men, or agricul
turists, or engineers, or electricians, and
their natural impulse will be to study
science and the modern languages.
But here new embarrassments beset the
young American. No man ever learned a
modern language at school or college.
French, German and Spanish can only be
learned by association with those to whom
these languages are a mother tongue. And
as to the modern sciences, a life is hardly
long enough to master any of them, and
it is hard to convince the student that the
four years of his course can be usefully
employed in acquiring the bare rudi
ments. Thore is where Mr. Gilman's men
tor may come usefully into play. He will
well serve his country and his university
if he convinces the ambitious student that
four years will be well spent in mastering
the fundamental principles of chemical
and electrical science, if, when they come
to an end, the student is outfitted with
the knowledge requisite to undertake pro
founder strides which will lead to prac
tical results.
The true end, however, of university
education is not to acquire proficiency in
specialties, but bo to discipline the mind
that on entering practical life tbo gradu
ate's character shall be formed: that he
shall be prepared to do his duty as a man
and citizen; that his mind shall be clari
fied so he can discern truth from false
hood ; that his soul shall be resolute in an
honest desire to distinguish, tha thing
known and for whom my shelve* are the heftier. They were adepts at
gathering for friends with specialties books of which they themselves k
possessed copies or for which they had no especial craving. They were T
mostly modest in their own interests, but possessed a hrge boldness in I
behalf of others. I would advise, however, the would-be mccessful ama
teur not to cultivate too much modesty, if thu caution be at all necessary
to tiose affected with our mania.
" 'There be quests after rare and dainty volumes who are so entirely
bent upon their lond pursuit that it was never safe to leave them to them
selves in a room with an unchained valuable book out 01 which the open
ing would not be barred and bolted,' so says an English worthy. The
fact is. tnough not generally known, that we have had even in remote
times a very active fraternity. We must have had a spirited chapter of
our guild at Oxford in the time of Henry IV, since the books bequeathed
by good old Richard de Bury were first kept in locked chests ani after
ward the 'said volumes were put into pews or studies and chained to
them.'
"Henry V was a successful booklifter. He got hold of St. Gregory's
works belonging to the prior of Christ's Church, Canterbury, and refused
or failed (ihe same thing) to return them. And the prior of Sbene alter
Henry's death got the volumes and he, too, held on to them. The same
Henry bad borrowed two volumes of Lady Westmoreland and of course
she never got tnem back; her petition to bis successor for their return is
still preserved. If his successor were not a book-keeper she probably got
the books. LewisXl of France seems to have been practicing the art of book
lifting somewhat overboldly, for when he applied to the Faculty of Medi
cine for certain books they were cautious enough to demand a forfeit of rich
plate and a joint bond with one of his nobles for the due return of the
books. A little more adroitness upon the part of our royal predecessors
would have prevented their book-collecting from being beset by such
heroic obstacies.
"By this it appears very plainly that we of the nineteenth century are
not the original Agamemnons, and should cultivate a humble spirit
endeavoring to become more expert and crafty, not thinking we have
brought our science to the ultimate perfection. Bound, as we ieemingly
are, by no rules of conscience or morals, the field of our development la
very great.
"What an unjust condition it is that so many coveted tomes, musty
with age, worn out, faded, bewitchingly antique and rare, should lie in
the libraries of the illiterate rich, or in Bodleian or other collections
beyond the reach of our ingenuity. I have often thought that it was only
the disseminated state of our members, not a lact of individual seal, that
has prevented and does prevent a sacking of these unyielding deposi
tories.
"After an enumeration of these principles which underlie the art of
book-keeping and book-getting, it would hardly seem necessary to write
an apolegia pro rita nostra. Yet J cannot pass over unnoticed the severe
chastisement which the book maniac has received in that charming book,
The Story of My House.' It is evident, from what Mr. Ellwanger says
in the chapter ' Magicians of the Shelves' that he is not a bibliodemon,
and that he has somewhai suffered himself from those who are, else being
a member, the esprit de corps which animates the fellowship would have
saved him unscathed. A suggestion to the wise is sufficient.
"I need only add to the acme of perfect book-collecting, according to
the highest ethics of our guild, is to be the possessor of a library, every
volume of which shall have been acquired only by gift, devise descent or
theft."
With that Mr. Hopper smiled genially, gave a hitch to his armful of
books, and proceeded on to his hotel. J- C.
and tireless feathered companion, which
speedily becama an object of the liveliest
interest.
If the bird was aware that it was doing
anything out of the ordinary it gave no
evidence of it. Steadily it held on its
course and could apparently bare done so
many hours longer without inconve
nience.
At about 7 o'clock in the morning the
gull having been seventeen hours on the
wing without rest, the Pomona arrived
off the bar at Eureka and turned to go in.
The gull did not follow long. On the con
trary with a shrill scream it turned and
flew straight out seaward. When last
seen, its one dangling leg making it a
marked object, it was still on the wing
and may have continued ao for hour*, for
all that is kKown.
Several piiot3 who have in the course of
their voyages watched 8"a gulls carefully
said to an inquirer for The Call that no
seagull has ever been encountered farther
from land than 200 miles, on either the
Atlantic or Pacific coast, so far as there is
any record ; and the opinion of these
observers was that fifty miles was about
as far as a gull would be liable to fly at
one time without resting. Gulls have been
carefully observed and their habits noted
ail over the world, there being gulls of
different varieties even in Iceland, Spits
bergen and other lands where the temper*
atnre is often very low.
Last week an account of a remarkable
Might of a homing piseon above the Sierra
Nevada was published in this paper. The
probability is that the authenticated flight
of the seagull which was observed so
carefully by Mr. Hammon is entitled to
be considered equally unique. At all
events there is no other seagull record of
equal interest authentically established
Atvario us times the idea of employing
seagulls for messenger service as homing
pigeons are used has been discussed.
The case in point demonstrates that they
have sufficient wing power. That is prob
ably all the endowment they have, for
their home is wherever they find them
selves at night except during the mating
season.
What prompted the gull to fly 250 miles?
Tne bird gets its name from a Latin word
gulo, which means glutton. Very lisely
that name explains it all. The chase was
inspired by the hope of getting fine mor
sels from the steamer's larder. When the
vessel turned in toward Eureka the wise
gull knew that the cruise was over.
which is from the thing which is not;
that his spirit shall be so self-reliant and
virile that no amount of persuasion or ex
ample shall tempt him to wander into the
fog of conventional falsehood. That is
the only rational purpose, the only excuse,
for the existence of the university to-day.
Of coarse the fulfillment of such a lofty
purpose requires a large and carefully
selected staff, so that each student shall
be known through and through by some
member of the faculty; and this requires
a liberal endowment and an income which
shall not be stinted. Here is where the
University of California is handicapped.
It is the proud out the false boast of our
people that no man in this happy State
runs risk of starvation. In fact, we are
starving tbe minds of our young men and
women who are the hop* of the State, and
that Kind of starvation is more terrible
and more lasting in its effects than the
attenuation of the stomach from the want
of bodily food.
; It brings a flush of shame to the Cali
fornian cheek to compare the income of
the Berkeley university with that of cor
responding Institutions in other Darts of
the country. In this present year (1897)
the income' of some of our leading uni
versities is as follows:

It is evident that if the University of
California is to fulfill its duty its income
must be enlarged, either by act of the
Legislature or by the endowment of
wealthy citizens. That something may
be expected from both sources no one will
doubt. The Legislature will probably per

-â .â¢- â  . , â¢REMARKABLE OLD NEWSPAPER.
As far as known, there are only two copies of the Boston Gazette of March 12, J77o^ in
existence. One of them is in the Smithsonian Institute and the other belongs to Mr. Randlette of
Alameda. They are most likely the oldest copies of an American newspaper in existence. This pub
lication, the two interior pages of which are here reproduced, is particularly interesting: because it con
tains an account of the famous Boston massacre, written a few days after the tragic event took
place. The legibility of the paper, considering its age, is remarkable. A few blurred spots appear
in the print, but these are only torn and stained places in the original. It is gratifying to know
that such a valuable relic of Revolutionary days is on the Pacific Coast. Possibly no publication
in existence throws so much light on the real sentiments of those who took an active part in the
events of those stirring times. The old paper shows that there was a little reverence for King George,
even though England was despised.
"Of course I win let The Call reproduce my old copy of the Boston
Gazette," said Mr. Randlette, as he took his worn and faded treasure out
of a small tin box. It had to be handled gently. The paper was yellow
with age and soft with frequent handling. Here and there along the
edges, where it Dad been folded, holes were worn through, and brown
spots appeared in several places, almost obliterating the print. But after
a little patience in thinking of missing words the whole paper becomes
legible and intensely interesting. You can spend hours in loosing over it
and then look over it again, with increasing interest.
"That paper, as far as I know," continued Mr. Randlette, speading it
out gently on a table, "has been in niy family ever since it was pub
lished 127 years ago. I got it fro^i my father at Laconia, N. H., and he
got it from his fattier years before I was born. -Of course, the supposition
is that my grandfather was the original purchaser. During his lifetime
there could have been nothing curious about it, and if he bought it at all
he must have bought it for such information as it contains. Or, perhaps,
he may have bought it on purpose to preserve the record of the Boston
massacre, that event which i**d such great weight in turning public
opinion against England.
"How long have I had it? Oh, about thirty years. I had it long
before 1 came to California, and I bave been here twenty years.
"The way the paper came to be preserved is a little story in itself-
Of course only part of the story is known. It seems that something like
eighty-five years ago there was a fire in the old homestead, and things
were picked up in bundles and carried to places of safety. In one of
these bundles was the old Boston Gazette, although the manner of its
petting there is not known. At any rate it seems that the saved articles
at once acquired a historical value in the family and were stored away as
treasures. How long they lay in some dark corner I don't know, but the
time came when they were brought to light, and of course the old paper
was looked upon as a great curiosity even in those days. I remem
ber my father was always very proud of it. Of course I have always
thought the world of it, and money couldn't buy it, but just what I will
do witn it I have not yet decided. It is getting so old it can hardly be
handled, and if I show it to people it will keep on gretting worse and
worse. I have lent it to al! sorts of historical affairs, whicn of course did
not improve its wearing qualities.
"While in Washington a few years asro I went to the National Mu
seum and found that there is no copy of the paper there a3 old as mine-
Naturally enough the officials tried to get me to give it to them, and reaily
I feel as though I ought to donate it to some historical society, where it
will be properly cared for in a fire-proof building and people can see it at
any time. But whatever I eventually do with it, 1 do not think I will
send it East. Of course Washington is nearer the place where the paper
was published, and people are supposed to be more interested in such
things back there that tr.ey are here, but I think I will give the paper to
some society in California. We are just as much interested in the history
of the country as the Eastern people; so I think the old paper will remain
here, and if it interests anybody I will be more than pleased."
In glancing over this old copy of the Boston Gazette it is hard to real
ize that people ever lived in America who entertained the sentiments it
expresses. The Republic was only in the formative stage then, and al
ttaouen there is complaint against the laws of England there is a
declaration of "allegiance to the King" in many parts of the paper.
Fancy it, oh ye who now enjoy the freedom which was so dÂ«arlv bought
only a few years afterward!
In fact the era of which the old paper is a representative was the
connecting link between monarchy and liberty. In those days men's
minds were as if on a pivot. The wrongs of the oppressing government
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
were too apparent to be overlooked, and yet the old idea of royalty and
divine right was so firmly fixed in the minds of the people that they
hesitated. "King and country" or "country and liberty" were hard to
decide between.
Consequently one day ail was anger and England's troops were re
sisted; the next day the most rabid advocates of freedom "acknowledged
the king as the ruler of all."
A careful perusal of this old paper, particularly the communications,
leads you to doubt if the populace really desired absolute separation from
England. One writer says it is possible to acknowledge the King and still
oppose the troops and the revenue laws. Another says such a thing is im
possible. And so it goes on.
If the old caper can betaken as a criterion of the feeling existing at
the time (and why should it not?) the impression is that what was really
desired in 1770 was a sort of home rule instead of independence. Down
with the soldiers and the revenue officers, but God save the King.
Of course long before the battle of Bunker Hill was fought the feel*
ing changed. The errors, mismanagement and injustice of King George
and hii redcoats became unbearable. His name was hateful, conse
quently the battles that gave us freedom followed.
Even in dealing with the massacre the editor of the old paper has
nothing to say against the King, but roundly abuses the soldiers and
revenue officers. The blame seems to be laid solely to the fact that the
soldiers were kept "in the city of Boston in times of peace" to enforce
laws that really belonged to the constabulary. That this argument was
considered pretty strong is borne out by the fact that the troops wÂ«re at
once removed to other quarters where they would not annoy citizens. The
fact that the citizens were really breaking the laws of the then existing
Government is dwelt upon to some extent, but this part of the tragedy is
looked upon as of little importance. The feeling seems to have been that
they had a right to break the laws, and that the soldiers were all in the
wrong â in fact, had no business to be where they were, much less to use
lorce to carry out objectionable laws. Whoever had the editing of the
paper was certainly a man well posted on the affairs of the day, for the
conclusions drawn are logical and spirited.
The heading of the old paper bears the words "The Boston Gazette
and County Journal. No. 779. Containine Fresheft Advices, Foreign
and Domeftic. Monday, March 12, 1770." In the center of tne heading
is a rude wood cut with the figure of "Britannia," such as appears on
coins of the present day, releasing a bird from a cage. This was of
course intended to convey some idea of freedom, although why the act
should be being performed by Britannia is not quite clear.
The editor of the Boston Gazette and the editor of a modern daily
would certainly disagree as to what constituted "newes" and the way it
should be disdayed. On the first page of this paper there is an essay
and argument in the best place, while the great historical event, the Bos
ton massacre, is vzorked over onto the inside of the paper.
Fancy starting the first column of a newspaper with a quotation
from Shakespeare. But that is what was done in 1770. And the quotation
was dumped in close to tne top rule without the least sign of a head line.
The article following and to which the quotation was intended as a
prelude starts off with a big initial letter. The writer then goes to great
pains to break down the arguments made by a contributor in a letter in
a previous issue. This seems to have been some sort of a discussion as
to where a man was to draw the line between "kinz and country."
The writer had evidently written that it was preposterous "To
acknowledge allegiance to the King and deny obedience to the laws of
Great Britain." That thii is not impossible is the task the editor set
himself, but the conclusion of the article hardly shows that his argument
was what would be called convincing. It rather looks as thongb the editor
felt no respect for the King; at least no more than be felt for the laws of
Great Britain, but was a little bit afraid to say so. On the same page
here are ace ounts of several meetings to protest against the taxes and
commercial laws of Great Britain. One of tbe notices in regard to the
resolutions of the citizens of the town of Roxbury read>: "Voted, that we
will not make use of any foreign teas in our several families until the
tevenue acts are repealed â case of sickness eicepted." There are also
reports of several other meetings in the vicinity of Boston where similar
resolution - were passed. Francis Faulkner was Town Clerk of the town
of Acton at the time. The spirit of these meetings all seems to be against
England and her laws, but not a word is said against King George.
However, nothing is said in his favor, either. But the spirit and determi
nation of the meetings is of such a degree as to be almost surprising.
The story of tbe massacre, which begins on the second page and ends
on the first column of the third, is really a splendid piece of writing and
handled in a masterly, almost scholarly, manner, but it would hardly be
satisfactory in modern journalism, either to editor or reader. The article
begins with an editorial of a very able character and consider the causes
and effects of the massacre before describing the tragic event. The only
heading la the article is the date line. It starts righv under the rule.
The two pages of the paper describing tne massacre are bordered with
heavy black ruie, or "put in mourning," a custom which was common
enough even only a few years ago. There is a possibility that this is the
first time this was ever done on a newspaper.
The story of the massacre can be read on the pages reproduced here.
It is beyond dispute that the original is the first account of the event eveÂ»
published written by men who saw it. Of course the cause of the massacre
is a matter of history, and it has been conceded to be the one great event
that made the colonies a united people. Ud till that time the people felt
the galling chains of English rule, but the massacre was the last straw
and hundreds rose in arms. From that time until the Battle of Bunker
Hill the Yankees were ready to fight.
In the so-called massacre only four were killed, but they were de
fenseless citizens cut down by troops. The act caused such an outburst
of indignation that the troops were removed from Boston. As a strong
contrast to modern journalism nothing could be more striking than the
pictures. A modern editor would not stop short of getting pictures of the
dead men. The editor of the Boston Gazette was content, perhaps
pleased, to display pictures of the four coffins. Nor did the artist go into
details. It was not necessary. He simply cut out a black Diock and cut
the letters and "skulls and crossbones" in white. The description of the
funeral is not lengthy, but it tells all there was to tell.
At the conclusion of the article about the massacre there is what
might be called an apology from a man named Adam Air. This indi
vidual was evidently a sort of cabinet-maker, and was accused of aiding
the soldiers by providing them with clubs. His notice reads as follows:
"Some evil-minded person or persons has falsely reported of me, the
subscriber, that I did, on Saturday, the 3d inst., make at my shop a
number of clubs for use of the soldiers, which report tends to my disad
vantage. Ido therefore hereby declare tbat I never did make or cause to
be made by myself or any other person any club or clubs or any sort of
weapon for any of the soldiery; and if any such thing was done at my
shop it was entirely without my knewledge. To the truth of which lam
ready to attest on oath. As witness my hand. ADAM AIR."
The rest of the third page is given over to news and advertisements.
The "telegraph" news consists of a paragraph dated New York, March 1,
or nearly two weeks previous to the issuing of the paper. It refera to the
movements of British troops and the order was evidently issued without
any calculation being made for unforeseen events.
The advertisements are simply curiosities both as to wording and the
objects for sale or wanted. The typography of these is really good work.
Any compositor of the present day need not be ashamed to produce the
like. Of course there is nothing fancy in the type, but it is weil propor
tioned and well cut. The print is clear and the general effect is pleasing.
One noticeable thing about the old paper is the slight reference made
to women. As a matter of fact one would hardly think there were such
beings from a perusal of its columns. There is not a single reference to a
woman, except as the parent ot a certain man. In the advertising col
umns there is an advertiieruent of a woman who wants work. Verily,
those were not the days of women's riguts, or women's congresses,
either.
The publishers of the Boston Gazette were Edes it Gills and their
Dlace of business in yueen street. They also got out an almanac and reg
ister and did a general printing business. They claimed to do the best
work of the time and the appearance of the paper certainly mak-s it ap
pear as if they aid. The ink and paper used must have been of a different
quality than that of the present day. Where the paper has not been
rubbed and stained it is as white as many of the San Francisco morning
papers on the day they are issued and the ink is as black as the day it was
printed. In fact the ink is not faded in the least, but where it appears
cray it does so on account of being rubbed from the paper by handling-
Mr. Randlette's treasure is naturally delicate to handle, but this is also
the result of rubbing, and the wonder is there is any of the paper left
considering the fact that it has been handled for a century and a quarter.
The number of Mr. Randlette's old copy of the Boston Gazette is 77U,
which would make it appear as if the publication had been in existence lor
many years prior to 1770. Granting that it came out once a week it would
follow that it had been published for fifteen years. This would make the
date of the first issue some time during the year 1755. It is also probable
lhat during the first years of its life the Boston Gazette may have been a
monthly. In fact, this is more than probable. After running awhile for
as a monthly it may have become a semi-monthly before becoming a
weekly.
Calculating on this basis the date of the first issue would be as far
back as 1740, possibly farther. All this is very interesting to historians,
as it tends to show how strong an interest was taken in freedom's greatest
friendâ the press â long before a blow was struck in its cause. Consider
the fact that only a handful of New Englanders could support and en
courage a newspaper a century aud a half aeo and there is little wonder
that the United States at the present time is the greatest newspaper
country In the world.
After all is said it would seem as if the demand for freedom on the
part of the American people was coupled with a demand for knowledge.
Hence tne fact that there were newspapers flourishing all over the
Colonies long before many of the good-sized cities of Europe ever thought
of a newspaper. At the present day in the East there are flourishing
newspapers in many small cities, while cities in Europe of the same
size are without them. Coming further West, the same will hold. In
California there are newspapers in the very smallest towns, and often in
mere camps.
The village of Tracy, containing not more than 300 people, has a
weekly newspaper, and the fact is not looked upon as unusual. The
people of a place of the same size in Illinois would think a man was in
sane if he thought of starting a newspaper in their town. And so the, list
might be lengthened. The more progress and the more freedom the
more the desire for knowledge.

REFUSED HIS SIGNATURE.
Auditor Broderick TTonld Not Approve
the Pension Demands of Re
tired Teachers.
The retired teachers of the School De
partment who expected to draw their
pensions yesterday received a setback on
Thursday when the Auditor sent the war
rants back without his signature.
The trouble was that the demands were
drawn tinder :he old law, the teachers
having been advised that they could |get
tneirm oney just as well that way at to
wait until tne new Annuity and Retire
ment Fund Commission is in working
order.
The Auditor's reason for refusing to sign
Â»>â  that the new law has superseded the
oid one and that in order to get the
money the fund must be transferred by
tLe Board of Supervisors from the fund
under their con.roi to that of the com
miajio:!. TLe amount of the demands ag
gregated abon: $l'2oo divided among

& MINERS
The statistician of the Mining Bureau, t
Charles G. Yale, has finished the compilation
of the bureau bulletin, showing the complete :
mineral production of the State for 1896. The ;
varied mineral products of the State are in
dnded under thirty-five heads, and the figures ]
show that the metals Â«nd minerals, other j
than gold and silver, produced in the State j
daring the year were valued at over $0,000,- ,
000, making the total rcineral wealth pro- j
<iuced $24,291,3 -
These statis ics reach the public in fairly j
good season, i ompar* I with the general habit
of such official iuformatlon. These figures are
as reliable a> *uch information can be made
and they will stand as the official record for !
the year. Their compilation has involved I
persistent and repeated inquiries in addition j
returns from the regular blanks sent to j
every known mineral producer and to other
sources oi information. The experience of
three or four years has given miners and man
ufacturers confidence that their figures will
remain confidential and be usod only in mak
ing up totals, and this year increased readi
ness and good iaith have been s-hown.
The comp.ete statistics of the gold and sil
ver production have already beeu given, and
the interest in this bulletin mainly concerns
other products. Petroleum last year advanced
to second place in the State's mineral produc
tion, and quicksilver fell to third place. The
small production of silver still further de
i lined. This metal retains fourth place among I
i he metals with a rrcord oi $422,463, but Its
value is exceeded b., trick and by macadam.
Coal cuts a small figure, as usual, and the i
value of the product declined $32,433; but j
the operation of the Corral Hollow mines this j
year will, for the first time, set coal high on !
the list of the State's mineral products. The j
recent revival of the demand for copper and j
ci copper minine showi its effect in the table
by an iaerea>e of Â§177,618 in the value of
â¢he product. This is aue almost whoily to the !
active operations of the tcouli syndicate â 
operating in Siskiyou County, and the present
year promises a more hotable increase. The j
-.ncrease credited to petroleum Is due to the ,
late increase of prices in the Los Angeles J
:he increase by barrels being but !
trifling.
one of the most noticeable things about the
table is the effect of the business depression
on structural materials. With hardly an ex
ception these show a marked decrease. Brick,
building stones of all kinds, lime, cement, !
slate and macadam found hard times and a i
lessened demand. The increased gold produc
tion saved the total record from a decline. !
The. increase credited to gold is $1,847,245 j
aad the total net increase in the value ol ail ;
mineral products is a little 1e55â ?1, 446, 734. \
1 he total increase in 1895 over 1894 was about
$2 400,000.
1 he precious metals yielded $17,604 026; all
me ;allic substances, $18,937,793; not metallic
substances, $2,415,993; hydrocarbons and
gases, $1,777,340; structural materials, 1p2,
--160,2~'2. The total values by substances and
the increase and decrease as compared with
1695, are shown in the following tab.c:

During the coming week the International
Gold-miners' convention, which is to meet in
Denver two months hence, will doubtless be
enlisting the active interest of California
mining men. and preparations for California
representation will be begun. This conven
tion has been so far but vaguely heard of out
here, and in the absence of definite Informa
tion about the scope, purposes and probable
importance of the convention and of an in
vitation to participate no particular considera
tion has been given to it. However, this has
been because the preparations for it at Denver
have been inchoate. Within two or three
days the committee appointed by the Chamber
of Commerce, Board of Trade, Miners' Bureau
and other Denver bodies which have taken
the matter up bat decided upon the repre
sentation, and formal communications will
Boon reach the Miners' Association, Mining
Bureau, the Governor and others in this State.
, Without waiting this, Julian Sonntag, secre
tary oi the Miners' Association, telegraphed
" day before yesterday to the Governor of Colo
rado, asking for information about the con-
Tendon. The newspaper dispatches tell that
the convention is to meet July 8, 9 and 10 at
i Denver, and the representation allowed is
thirty delegates- at-large from each State and
Territory, to be appointed by the Governor,
livo 110 m each county, five from each city and
one additional for each 1000 of population.
Upon th 3 slight information received Secre
tary Sonntag himself is much interested, and
this week the executive committee of the
Miners' Association will probably meet to take
some steps toward participation.
This will be the first interstate gathering of
mining men and what the convention will
consider and do will develop largely during
its sessions. The main idea of the promoters
now appears to be the consideration of
methods and appliances for gold mining, and
1 this is to be attended by an exhibit of mining:
i machinery, etc., and by an exhibit of ores and
so on. Ol course the advertising of Colorado's
steadily developing gold fields is a main mo
tive of the Colorado people. A great deal of
good will be accomplished by a gathering to
gether of representative miners from the
whole Pacific Coast, for a study of the most
modern and efficient gold-saving methods, for
with all the rapid advance of science
and invention in mining, old and inefficient
methods are too common and still too much
of a clog on development. Whatever be the
programme the getting together for three
I days of a large body of representative miners
to exchange ideas will benefit every man who
attends, and the industry at large.
This first convention will itself develop the
good of such gatherings and their work.
Many things not in the minds of the original
promoters will be put forward. The repre
sentatives of the California Miners' Associa
tion, for one thin;, will urge the matter of
National and State mining legislation. A
committee of the association has in hand a
revision and codification of the United States
mining laws, meant ior Congressional atten
tion in a year or two, and tie convention will
be asked to take hold of this matter and give,
it the influence of the entire mining West.
An indors2meut of the mineral lands bill for
which the Miners' Association is still fighting
will likely te asked. The Californians, too,
will be apt to urce steps to secure uniformity
of State mining legislation, which does not
now exist.
The California Miners' Association itself
will be a valuable exhibit. No miners' organ
ization anywhere has ever proved so influen
tial and successiul in behalf of the industry,
and its ways and works will be a lesson there.
California as a gold field will get its share of
the advertising that goes with the convention.
The time for preparation is so short and pros
pects of what the convention will amount to
are so vague that the California makers of
mining machinery will do little or nothing
toward sending exhibits, and there is no pros
pect that much will be done in the way of a
display of California ores, but tnis convention
will be a starter of an institution that may be
to the mining industry of the West what the
trans-Mississippi congresses have been to
Western commerce.
Some interesting problems concerning the
â¢ new State mining law, which will soon go
into effect, were stated the other day by the
puzzled Recorder oi tne Randsburg mining
district, E. B. Maginnis, who inquired as fol
lows cf Secretary Julian Sonntaeof the Miners'
Association:
"There are so many interpretations of the
new mining law, to make it clear to myself
and the miners here, will you kindly answer
| the following questions:
"When does it take effect? When am I to turn
; over my books to the County Recorder? How
' about turning over books in thirty days, when
law does not take effect until sixty days? The
Hand District is in Kern and San Bernardino
j counties, to wnich County Recorder am I
supposed to deliver my books? When shall 1
! stop receiving location notices? If the books
! have to be segregated where shall it be done
! and who shall pay for it?"
The problems were referred to Curtis H.
â¢ Lindley, chairman of the legislation commit- J
' tee, whose construction oi the law will interest j
' many. In his opinion Mr. Lindley says :
"I think that the queries propounded by Mr.
I Maginnis may ba answered as follows:
"1. The act was approved March 27, 1897,
; and it takes effect at midnight of May 25. No
I records made on or after May 26 in the Dis
trict R corder's office will be valid.
"2. The time within which the District Re
! corder is required to turn over the books to
| the County Recorder commences to run from
I the date the act 'takes effect,' which is equiv
'â  alent to its 'passage' in a iegal sense. In other
I words, the District Recorder should turn over
j his books to the County Recorder on or before
' June 25.
â¢'3. As Rand district lies partly in Kern
! County and partly in San Bernardino, I think
i the law will be satisfied by depositing the
i records with either County Recorder, suggest
ing the one where the District Recorder's office
; is situated, although this is merely a sugges
| tion.
"4. There is no law authorizing the records
| to be duplicated or segregated. The County
j Recorder in whose custody the books are
â  placed would be the lawful custodian and
i could issue certified copies, although the
! location in question might be in another
| county. Ido not see any serious difliculty in
I tlie situation at all, as the deposit of the
j records with either County Recorder will
j make them accessible aud fix a legal depos
i itary."
S. K. Thornton is still touring in the mining
counties stirring up the mining men to organ
j ize or strengthen local associations and to give
needed support of money and membership to
the Slate association. He has made no official
reports, but word comes from wherever he
goes that the miners give him and his mission
cordial welcome. He is much gratified at his
success, but Secretary Julian Sonntagsays tnat
he has not yet received a dollar in cash, and
he painfully waits for the county associations
to send in their dues.
â¢'The treasury is empty, and we need
money," says Mr. Sonntag. "Lait year the as
sociation's expenses were $5311. This year, so
far, we have tot plenty oi sympathy but no
money, aud not much can be done without
money. The annual convention, which will
meet next fall and cost $500, is some distance

off, buc there will be calls for money before
then. The coming convention at Denver may
require some. I think, too, that the asso
ciation ought to hire attorneys to help out the
miners in this new activity which the Sacra
mento anti-debris people are displaying. It
is an outrage the way those people who have
a fat thing spending the money the farmers
put up are doing now. The association ought
to take the matter right up."
Mr. Sonntag referred to a matter of impor
tance which some mining men fear is porten
tous of anew fight between the miners and
the anti-debris people. Recently an era of
complete good leeiing between the two ele
ments appeared to have arrived at last, and it
has everywhere been hailed with delight. If
the war should break out in a new place it
will be generally regretted, for the prosperity
of the mountain and valley regions, of the
miners and the farmers, li largely a matter of
common interest The new trouble has arisen
through the late activity of the Anti-Debris
Association, the Supervisors of Sacramento
County and their watchers in the mountains.
Heretofore hydraulic mining has been the
sole object of watchful solicitude, but now for
the first time, the miners say, the valley peo
pie have begun efforts to check ordinary sluic
ing and even the dumping of tailings from
quartzmills about the headwaters of the
sireams. The Sacramento Supervisors have
brought suits for injunctions in the Sacra
mento Couniy courts to restrain certain peo
ple in Nevada County from ground sluicing.
It is this which it is feared is about to cause
the entire mining interests of the mountains
to take up arms. A few days ago the matter
was warmly discussed at a meeting of the
Board of Trade of Nevada City, which
adopted strong resolutions threatening a gen
eral boycott ol Sacramento businessmen if the
new operations did not quickly cease. The
resolutions recalled the long years of bitter
feeling and litigation, the apparent restora
tion of harmony shown at the last session of
the Legislature, Â«ondemned the recen t suits as
an exhibition of bad faith and wound up as
follows:
'â¢That we recognize in this suit which has
been brought by the Supervisors of Sacra
meuto County against citizens of Nevada
County a new departure in litigation, involv
ing methods of mining which are perfectly
legitimate and Billowed by the State and
National Government. This new issue in
volves all classes ot mining, both quartz and
drift, as well as placer mining, to which it is
now directed, striking at the very foundation
of the mining interests of Nevada County.
And recognizing as we do the decisions of the
courts against hydraulic mining, we will not
submit without a struggle to a new step being
taken to crush our mining interests and will
do everything in our power to protect them.
"And be It further resolved: That in the
citizens of Sacramento we recognize people
who are and should be our friends, with
whom we have close relations in business,
which this litigation threatens to sever. That
we do not beiieve that the people of Sacra
mento indorse or in any way support the
action of the Sacramento Supervisors in bring
ing this action, believing that their action
was induced solely at the instigation of well
known agitators who have for years made
money out of both valley and mountains by
stirring up litigation. And it is no more than
right that we look to the conservative busi
ness men of Sacramento to protect their own
busine-is interests by protecting ours."

TWO COURSING PARKS.
The Leashmen of This City May
Soon Have New Grounds
for Sport.
Sportsmen of Capital Are Contem
plating the Lease of Several
Acres of Land.
"Well, I don't know," said Joe Mcln
erncy last evening to a number of friends
who bad gathered at the popular coursing
resort on Market street to discuss the
question of greyhounds and bares, "there
ie ample room for a second coursing park
near this City, and I have no doubt that
the projectors of such a bcheme would
reap a rich harvest from the financial re
sults as there is good money in coursing
parks nowadays."
M. Traynor, the popular tea merchant
and sportsman, acquiesced in the opinion
vouchsafed by Mr. Mclnerney and re
marked that as coursing has taken won
derful strides in the past two years and
has gained numerous supporters there
should be at least two well conducted
coursing parks within easy reach of this
City, as one park can only accommodate
on Sundays a certain number of dogs
which are but few in comparison to the
great number that must wait an oppor
tunity to run within the inclosnre.
Mr. Traynor was also of the opinion
that coursing is something similar to
many other branches of sport that are
made popular and interesting to the spec
tators because of the opposition elsewhere.
Lotvez, Kerrigan, Ryan, Edmunds, But
ler, Kramer and several other gentlemen
who take an active interest in the sport
of tbe leash have expressed their opinions
on coursing, and they all admit that there
is ample room for two coursine parks in
or near this county.
It was stated last evening by a sports
man who recently overheard a conversa
tion between some gentlemen who are
financially able to assist in the purchase
of grounds for a new coursing park, that
a scheme is now being hatched with the
object in view of leasing a large number
of acres of land within easy reach of some
of the streetcar lines of this City, and that
a beautiful park will be constructed, part
of which will be used for coursing and
part for such sports as football, baseball
and ail kinds of athletic pastimes.
If tbe parties interested in the enter
prise can obtain a good lease of the land
they nave in view there is not any doubt
that a year hence the coursins iraiernity
of this City and the adjoining country
will have an opportunity of racing their
aogs for valuable prizes at whichever
park they may select for a day's outing.
As the sport is annually growine very
popular, and as new dogs are being im
ported from the East and elsewhere, it is
only a question of a very short time when
the patrons of the leash must have a sec
ond running ground; otherwise there
must be two days' racing held to accom
modate the owners of the longtails, many
of which must now remain in their ken
nels for weeks before they can have an
opportunity to compete on Sundays at
Ingleside.
Doubtless there will be a coursing com
pany organized in this City within a
month for the purpose of establishing a
new coursing park which will be within
easy reach of all coursers.
HE WAS NOT LOVED.
And, Therefore, Julius Ungemach
Turned on tne Gas and l-ay Down
to Sleep.
Julius TJngemacb of 610 Ellis street had
a quarrel with bis wife and determined on
a short cut to a divorce by the gas route.
He went upstairs to an unoccupied room,
stopped all the crevices, wrote a letter to
his wife to disrobed, turned on the gas and
went to sleep forever.
He was found dead at half- past 6 o'clock
yesterday morning, and the following note
written in pencil in the German language
was found on & table by his bedside:
My only beloved Helena: Please forgive me for
this deed, but I cannot do otherwise. I love
you fondly, but you do not love me. I beg of
you only one thing. Take good care of dear
Alexander for my sake, and once more forgive
me, my only beloved Helena.
Be not angry with the dead. I love you un
to the last breath and have always loved you.
1 was always too kind to everybody, and on
that account have been imposed upon.
Iwould die willingly li 1 only knew that
you, my only beloved Helena, forgave me.
Farewell, and I wish you everything good,
my beloved wife. Julius Ungemach.
The deceased was 39 years old and a
native of Germany. Little Alexander, his
son, is only 5 years old. Unpemach was a
waiter in the Oberon beer palace.
Coroner Hawkins took charge of the
remains and will bold an inquest.
ST. EOSE'S WINDOW.
Father Nugent Sued by Bernard Him
man for Alleged Infringement.
Bernard Hausman, doing: business as
Hausman Bros., has sued Father Dennis
Nugent and Thomas C. Butterworth for
$1500 damages, alleged to be due for in
fringement of the plaintiff's rigbt to re
produce an art glass window representing
St. Rose of Lima. The window was in
serted in St. Rose Church on Brannan
street, which Father Nugent recently com
pleted.
Mr. Hausman says this window was de
signed for him by the Tyrolese Art Glass
Company and that he has the exclusive
privilege of using the same. According to
his description, on the middle panel there
was a large and beautiiul figure or repre
sentation of Saint Rose of Lima standing
in the foreground of a radiant flowery
landscape, bearing a crucifix in her right
hand and holding an open Bible in her
left hand, her bead being surrounded with
a golden halo, and two angels hovering
over her, holding aloft a golden crown,
evidently intended for her. There were
many other designs, original and beauti
ful in appearance, to which the plaintiff
makes claim of sole proprietorship. These
claims were denied by Father Nugent and
Contractor Butterworth â hence this suit.
Arrested for Liibel.
H. Windel, a merchant of this City, was ar
rested early Friday afternoon on complaint
of Marion Torres and detained at the Califor
nia-street police station on a charge of libel.
Torres alleges that Windel caused to be pub
lished in a local Italian paper an article re
flecting on his character. The prisoner was
released last evening on $500 cash bail.

for this benetit, and is doing all possible
for the good cause. She is a native
daughter and well known throughout the
State. Society will be well represented at
the benetit, and will assist in selling
flowers at the flower booths, which will be
beautifully arranged for the occasion.
Rehearsals commence this week.
There were 175 men at work on tha
boulevard yesterday morning, not includ
ing the drivers of tbe forty-two teams.
The macadamizing is progressing rapidly,
but it will take a considerable sum yet to
finish it. Only $190 75 was subscribed

Any. satisfaction which, may be felt in

One of the notable features of the Mis
sissippi flood this year is the length of
time it has continued. The water has
been up to the danger point for fully a
month. It is believed this is caused by
the levee system, and accordingly it is
used as one more argument by those who
object to that mode of dealing with the
problem and wish, to try some other.

Public confidence in the Park Ccramis-
Bion was not shaken by the cnarges made
against it by irresponsible parties, bnt all
the same it is gratifying to have the Grand

reposed in them in the best possible man
ner, and deserve the keariiesi commenda
tion of their fellow-citizens."

The Philadelphia Enquirer asserts that

It is reported that the Agricultural De

tuned from all parts of the country for
sugar-beet seed, and the Secretary can
bardiy keep up with the demand. While
the cultivation of sugar beets in this
country has been hitnerto mainly con
fined to California, Nebraska and Kansas,
the farmers of thirty Btates and Territories
will experiment with it during the coming
season. The new industry, in fact, show*
signs of becoming a fad, or a boom, and,
like all sucti things, is likely to be over
done in localities where there are not
good markets for the beeis assured.
THE PARK COMMISSION.
The charges which Have been made against tha Park Commission for some time
past came from sources too unreliable and were supported by parties too irresponsible
to give any uneasiness to the public or even occasion much popular interest. It was |
everywhere felt that the charges were false, and that the first complete investigation
of the subject would disprove them. That this feeling was well rounded is now made
evident by the report of tne Grand Jury published in fall in The Call of yesterday.
The report covers every branch of the park administration and pives details of
management and expenditures of all important work of the year. In this way it
deals exhaustively witn every subject which was made a basis of criticism, or fault
finding on the part of those who have been trying to weaken public confidence in the
commission. It was not made carelessly nor by incompetent persons. Two experts
employed by the committee of the Grand Jury checked every item of expenditure and
receipt from July 1, 1896. to April 1, 1897. Every improvement made in the park
from the erection of the Park Lodge to the construction of bridges was investigated,
and in all cases the results were a complete justification of the Commissioners.
In closing tne report the committee declares: "Every facility was given your
committee to procure the facts and figures as given in this report, and the conclusion
arrived at is that the Commissioners have been and are carrying out their duties and
the trust reposed in them in the best possible manner, and deserve the heartiest com
mendation of their fellow-citizens."
This thorough and satisfactory refutation of the idle charges which have been
made against the park management will be gratifying to every good citizen. The
administration of Golden Gate Park has always been one of the features of our muni
cipal government in which the people take a just pride. It has never been involved
in a scanual nor suspected of jobbery. Citizens of the highest standing have account
ed it an honor to serve on the commission by reason of iis high character and good
repute-
It would be a great damage to the community if such men were to oe made the
victims of irresponsible abuse and invective, for it would then be difficult to get such
men as xre have had in the past to serve in the future. Honest officials merit the
protection of public sentiment against the assaults of slanderers, and right thinking
men will cordially agree with the committee of the Grand Jury that the Park Com
missioners deserve the "heartiest commendation of their fellow-citizens."
CONGESTED CAPITAL.
The fact that there is no scarcity of cap
ital in this country has been strikingly
illustrated by the recent refunding of the
bonded debts of some of the great railway
lines of the East. The new bonds bear
but Z\-i per cent interest and the ones they
replaced called for 7. In a single one of
these dea;s it is said the sum refunded
was $112,000,000, and was the biggest
transaction of the kind ever accomplished
in the United States.
The syndicates that undertook the ex
tensive deal were well posted as to the
amount of idle capital pressing upon the
market. They calculated that the exist
ence of unemployed money would force
the holders of the old bonds to accept the
new ones with only half the interest they
had been getting. If any were stubborn
it was easy to call in tbe outside capital
eagerly waiting for a chance to make 3Vo'
per cent.
The proof furnished by this big finan
cial transaction that abundant idle capital
has been lying in the vaults of the money
centers during all the long stagnation of
business and consequent distress will be
suggestive to Congress wnen it undertakes
the revision of the banking laws. That
so much money should be begging for em
ployment at a very low interest in t;>e
financial centers, while the outlying
towns and provinces were forced to lndns
triai inactivity because they could not get
the use of funds for twice or threefold tbe
o'-ij per cent, is an evil not perhaps bayond
the reach of remedy by improved bank
ing methods.
Of course the big blocks of capitil
placed at one deal, the long time of ihe
loan, and the certainty of the investment
being safe, will always give large financial
operators an advantage over small, scat
tered ones. There is no good reason, bow
ever, why the difference should be so dis
proportionate. It is tois ability of cor
porations to secure capital at low rates
which enables them to crush out indi
vidual enterprises. When the Nation
provides a prcper banking law which will
enable the small trader and manufacturer
to get money in true proportion to the
safety of the transaction then the reign of
the overgrown trusts will cease to be so
autocratic __________^__
SPANISH FINANCES.
The announcement of yesterday that i
the Spanish Government has been unable i
to raise money abroad and has been forced !
to borrow $60,000,000 from the Bank of j
Spain to continue the payment of tne j
troops in Cuba was in nowise surprising j
to any who have given consideration to |
the financial side of the contests iv which j
Spain is now engaged. War is not alto- |
gether a matter ot valor, and the main- i
tonance of her dominion in Cuba and in j
the Philippines has been as harassing to j
the financiers ana taxpayers of Spain as lo
her soldiers.
It is not the custom of the Spaniards to
make the financial affairs of their Govern
ment known to the outside world as fully !
as are those of other Europeau nations, j
It is well understood, however, that <
Spain can hardly hope to meet herobllga- |
lions, even if the war in Cuba should end
now, without entaiiine further expense, i
We can readily believe, therefore, that the |
agents of tne Madrid Government in the
financial centers of the world have writ- j
ten that it is useless to depend on credit j
abroad any longer, as foreign markets ;
will be closed to Spain until the war in I
Cuba is over, and that no kind ot Spanish |
securities would satisfy money-lenders.
It is difficult to see from what sources |
Spanish statesmen hope to be able to de- j
rive an income sufficient to keep up the j
war and justify them in borrowing money
from the BanK of Spain or from anybody
else. The taxpayers of the kingdom can
bear no greater burdens than are at
present imposed on taem, and certainly
nothing in the way of a revenue can be
looked for from devastated Cuba even if
her people were conquered and compelled
once more to contribute to the rcyal
revenues. The cost of tho Spanish Gov
ernment in Cuba in times of peace was
about $23,000,000 a year and this has been
incieased during the war about $10,000,000
a month. The debt piled up for Cuba is,
therefore, very large, and could not be
paid without a virtual confiscation of all
the property not yet destroyed in the
Island.
This being the financial situation which
confronts the Spanish Government we can
well understand why those in authority
should be so willing now to offer Cuba ail
the reforms her people originally asked
for. li can hardly be much longer before
they are willing to concede the independ
ence itself. Castilian pride may scorn to
sheath the sword thougn beaten in every
battle, but even that pride cannot co far
when there is no money in the treasury to
pay for the gome.
A recent visitor to the tea plantation of
Dr. Shepherd of South Carolina reports
that about 300 ecres are employed in the
cultivation of the plant, and that by im
proved processes of curing the product is
much superior to the Chinese article. Ac
cording to the doctor the only thing which
prevents the profitable growing of the
plant in the Southern States is the lack of
protection against the cneap labor of
China.
Kaiser William is reported to have
stated that Bismarck wished him to be
always fighting and be turned the Chan
cellor down for the sake of peace. It is
now Bismarck's time to talk a little.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
A SUMMEK CAVALIER-
San Francisco has always been accus
tomed to view the approach of summer
with a gloomy eye. For some questionable
reason, the wisdom of which has found
the appreciation of San Francisco stonily
inaccessible to its tender feet, ever}' sum
mer witnesses a deflation of population
hereabouts that resembles the escape of
gas from an overturned balloon. San
Frnncisco as a general community stands
| stockstill and marks this wholesale ex
j odus in lofty silence. Firm in the convic-
I tion that it does not deserve such deser
j tion, it scorns to lift a hand to stay it or
to give voice to the impatience whicn stirs
its soul as th-.' outwara-bound procession
i of summer-vacaters goes heed:essly by.
' Like the proverbial Spanish cavalier who
! has been done out of his sweetheart by
; the proverbial rival, this St. Francisco
with a swarthy brow stands arms folded
| in a side aisle moodily staring at the
I bridal cavalcade as it passes out into the
j country sunshine.
But underneath the brooding cavalier
| city's stolid exterior may not that self
[ conviction of superiority to the country
'rival be a true one? May not the city of
San Francisco indeed be undeserving of
the slight which it sustains through the
open preference of its sweetheart, Society,
j for the country in summer-time? Let
Society pause for a moment to consider
' San Francisco's advantages as a summer
! lover and then reply to that question.
What country pastime equals a drive
| through Golden liate Park Lehind a team
; that is vigorously indisposed to slumber
! by the wayside? What rural road com
pares with the cliff boulevard as a path
! for the wheel that loveth not the rock and
j the s-teep incline? What rustic scene
( eclipses the winding way around Ingle
j side, with its blessed insurances agains 1 .
i death by hunger or thirst and its thought
j fu! provision of the mounted policeman
I as a protector of the elusive pocketbook
! and tbe slippery jewel? What unsettled
I district, Jn short, compensates for its lack
I of the conveniences which the city and
: county of San Francisco affords to seekers
| after pleasure?
A change of air is a desirable tonic, to
be sure. It can be derived by a two hours'
j drive from the heart of ISan Francisco.
I Hunting and fishing are joys supreme
! beyond doubt. The bigzest hunting and
j nshiiiz clubs of the State have their head
! quarters in this City, from which they
| make brief excursions into fishing
I grounds only a short journey away, re
â â  turning within a couple or three days to
\ go to the theater or the Cliff or tbe Chutes
or soma otuer comfortable and civilized
diversion.
Society can do a half dozen things in
! the country, to wit : Lie in the shade and
watch the mercury climb out of the ther
mometer, eat lrult with the footprints of
! earwigs fresh upon it, roam through the
j wood 3 and list to the tuneful iay of the
joyous rattlesnake, don a bathinc suit by
the sad sea waves and become a victual at
\ a piscatorial picnic, drag a hshing-pole
I through fifteen miles of bramble and
! brake under a 1120 degree temperature, and
I go gunning with a boy and a dog neither
i of which may serve as game in lieu of the
i rabbit that roameth not in the path of
tbe sportive visitor from the city.
Bat in Pan Francisco society can lie in
j the shade with comfort, eat fruit with
| safety, perambulate woody glades that
: are as snakeles3 as the haunts of St. Pat
j rick, bathe with modern convenfence, fish
I ditto, and bunt in season where the ad
j vantage of finding what is hunted may
| be enjoyed.
Besides these, it can do a hundred other
j pleasurable things in the City that it can
i not do in the country.
Society, sweetheart of this aggrieved
lord, St. Francisco, whose worth has
been so lightly esteemed in summertime,
attend with thine ear to these rich dis
| closures.
PROBLEM Or THE MISSISSIPPI
The immense disasters from the Mis
sissippi floods bave set the country to re
newed thinking whether there is not some
practical solution of the problem, and in
many quarters there is advocated the
policy of turning the management of the
mighty stream entirely over to Federal
control. An imperative need exists that
some solution be reached, and it is be
lieved that no power less than that of the
Nation can furnish it.
The greatneis of the damage is a matter
of importance to the whole country. The
losses are variously estimated, come cal
culations placing the aggreeate as high as
$125,000,000. The area actually submerged
is as lar c as the btate ot South Carolina,
and the number of acres injured is nearly
equal to the extent of Indiana.
About $75,000,000 worih of cotton could
be grown on this land in an averaee year
besides other crops, and to all this hag
to be added the lose and damage of roads,
bridges, buildings, etc, and the expense
of relieving the destitute. To the extra
ordinary losses of the big flood-years must
be joined the Jesser damage that takes
place more or less every year, and which
in an aggregate of ten years would foot
up a mm that would go a long way to
ward restraining the destructive over
flows.
It is true the Mississippi is a force so
mighty as to almost make mm despair of
ever being able to control it, but it is also
true that money Jn sums of hundreds of
millions is a mighty force. It will not do
to supinely say ai the threshold of the
twentieth century that science cannot
reach out her arm in mastery of this evil.
For a hundred millions the Russians ex
pect to cut a canal across a continent and
join the Baitic and the Black seas. In the
valley of the Euphrates the ancient civili
zations succ 'sslully studied out problems
as vast to them as that of the Mississippi to
us, and executed ereat eLgineering feats
which changed the forces of destruction
into powers of production.
In the vexed question of whether the
Nation or the individual States concerned
should undertake the work of managing
the river it is contended that Federal con
trol would be contrary to principles of
our Government, and appropriations to
build and maintain the works would
be unconstitutional. Some think the ex
pense should be borne by those most im
mediately concerned. In the early his
tory of our Government the same ob
jections were ODposed to appropriations
for river and harbor improvements, but
they have been completely overborne by
advancing thought. In favor of Federal
control, it can bo said that only by this
means can a vast and comprehensive plan
be successfully carried out, and that the
regulation of a system so immense and
affecting so many different States as the
Father of Waters and its groat tributaries
is as naturally in the province of Federal
management as is interstate commerce
ana the carrying of the mails.
v lf it can be shown that a broad policy
of protection to the fertile, vaU#.y ol the
Mississippi would not redound, in profit
to the whole Nation, then surely some ar
rangement could be made for raising the
iunds from those most benefited; andatill
let the undertaking be a National enter
prise", so as to be carried on with an ef
fectiveness beyond the reacu of , States
acting separately.
THE MODERN KGLti OF CAVALRY.
The cavalry arm has been aptly termed the
"eyes and ears", of an army and the expres
sion indicates its principal modern employ
ment. Ttfe distinctive character of cavalry
is its mobility. The horse is the trooper's
principal weapon.
The great function of the cavalry is to fur
nish information of the enemy's numbers,
positions, plans and movements. Id doing
this It screens the army and thus prevents a
knowledge of our own movements from reach
ing the enemy. At the outbreak of war it
advances boldly into the hostile territory and
hinders, if possible, the mobilization and con
centration of the enemy's forces.
Ho important have these duties become that
tlie fate Â«f war may easily depend on how
well and faithfully they are performed. The
first example of such use of cavalry on a large
scale was by the Germans in the war of 1870,
and the easy confidence with which their
armies advanced through French territory
was due to their cavalry service. >'v sooner
was war declared than the German cavalry
puEhed, across the frontier in squads of five
and six, cutting telegraph lines, gaining in
telligence and terrorizing the inhabitants.
This incursion is thus graphically describad
by a well-known French writer: "Every day
tne same thingâ like an irritating fly, that is
driven away only to return the next moment,
the enemy's cavalry could not be laid hold of.
In sucn a recjnnaisance of three men if two
are billed, no matter as long as one -escaped
to tell the tale."
However, the success of tho German cavalry
was due very largely to the improper use of
the French cavalry and a lark of knowledge of
its true functions. In a future war this suc
cess will not be repeated.
With the increased ranee and intensity of
fire from infantry it was easily seen that ft
cavalry charge, having a much greater dis
tance to traverse and depending almost en
tirely on shock action, would have little
chance of success against unshaken infantry,
or even artillery in position. For a time many
predicted that the day of the employment of
cavalry masses was over and a reduction of Us
strength wns looked tor. These predictions
have not been fulfilled. Relatively to in
fantry, the cavalry and field artillery have
vastly increased in value of late years, and the
next large war will see them employed in
greater numbers than ever before.
Consequently much attention is now be
stowed by European powers on their cavalry,
and large masses of horsemen are kept con
stantly on the frontiers ready to advance at
the first note of war. The mounted arm re
quires time for training, and as it is the first
to lake the Held its strength must be kept up
constantly during peace. Cavalry maneuvers
are now held annually, and Russia keeps 30,
--000 horsemen in constant readiness on the
frontier of Poland.
As in the next campaign similar musses of
cavalry will be advanced by both sides and
pushed boldly forward with the same object
in view, cavalry engngemeuts on a large scale
may be expected before the hostile armies can
arrive upon the field of action. The future of
the campaign may easily depend upon the out
come of iheM ec^aitementi.
During the advance of tin army the cavalry
will spread iiselt out like ft screen, behind
which the commander-in-chief can maneuver
his torcesand make his dispositions for action
at his leisure, The cavalry is pushed forward
in small detachments, followed by larger
bodies, until it comes in contact with the
enemy, once this contact Is made It is never
lost. Kverything of importance in tront is re
ported to tne commander by a chain of
mounted men. The screen is pushed r,Â»ny
mile* in advance. By this method most of the
uncertainties of war are avoided, and surprise
II well nigh impossible. The successful appli
cation of this system, however, evidently de
pends on the intelligence and activity of the
cavalry. The time is evidently past vhen n
good seat and deshing appearance were the
princlp&l qualifications needed in a cavalry
officer.
In actual battle the role of the cavalry is less
important, but it will be largely used in ex
tending front, in flanking movements or as a
support to artillery la detached operations.
Charges will take place only under excep
tional circumstances. Some notaDle charges
were made in the Franco-German war, especi
ally that of Yon Bredou Rt Mars-la- Tour, but
the usual result wms almost total annihilation
with no corresponding advantage.
During the battle the cavalry has remained
to a large extent out of action and unem
ployed, and now large masses Â»iand ready to
be launched after the retreating enemy. Owing
to the exiiau- :ing fatigues of'an action and
other causes vigorous and sustained pursuits
after a battle have been extremely rare in the
past.
The importance of completing the victory
and if possible producing a rout aud annihila
tion of the van quished enemy are, however,
so* great that in future -we may expect pursuit
to bo pushed to the extreme limit. In the
past the absence of fresh troops has prevented
this, but with large masses of cavalry kept in
hand for the purpose matters have changed.
Instances have bÂ«en frequent 'of forces
beaten in battle, but which somehow were
ready on the next occasion. War is thus pro
longed, and in the future true humanity de
mands not merely that the opposing force be
beaten but that it be annihilated. In this way
wars and consequent suffering will be much
curtailed. In tuis work the cavalry will bo
calied upon to perform as equally glorious a
part as in the gallant days of Ziethen and
Seid.itz.

NATIONAL SENSE OF PROPRIETY IN FRANCE.
"So very French" ia an expression
which one hears constantly in this coun
try in order to indicate utterances, be
havior, literature and art that are indeli
cate and calculated to offend the sense of
propriety that prevails on this side of the
Atlantic. People who employ this form
of speech are probably ienorantof the fact
that identically the same meaning is ap
plied in France to the words "Bien Ameri
cain," which may be rendered as "so very
American," and to those who may feel dis
posed to doubt the truth of this assertion
it may be pointed out that within the past
fortnight popular sentiment at Paris has
forced the authorities there to quietly pre
vent the appearance in living pictures at
the Theatre dcs Folies Bereeres of an
American girl, who after desertine her
princely husband and children, had been
divorced under circumstances sufficiently
sensational to render her an attraction to
resorts of the music ha!l order. No harsh
measures were employed by the Prefect of
Police, but after having in vain appealed
to the ex-Princess for the sake of her chil
dren to abandon her projected debut on
the stage, he summoned the manager of
the theater and informed him that if the
appearance of the lady gave rise to even
the smallest demonstration on the part of
the audience he would instantly have the
Folies Lergeres cleared and closed on
grouuds of public morality. True, she
had previously failed in her attempts to
secure engagements on this side of the
Atlantic, the New York impresarios, who
â¢have their loreiingera on the pulse of pub
lic taste and sentiment, being of the opin
ion that she would not prove a "draw. "
But thatonly goes to prove what I intend
to convey, namely, that in spite of the
very widespread Impression to the con
trary, based upon misconception, the na
tional sense of propriety is much the
same in both the United States and
France, and that it is immensely superior
to that which prevails in most of the
other civilized nations of the world.
With regard to the misconception that
exists in France concerning the American
standard of good taste ana delicacy, il is
attributable in the main to the infinitely
superior amount of independence of
American women, and especially of Amer
ican young girls, to that enjoyed by their
French sisters. The latter do not under
stana this or make allowance for it, and
vrhen they see married women from across
the ocean arrayed in frocks that are con
sidered as daring, and young girls going
about unescorted, flirting and attending
theatrical performances at the Palais Roy
al and the Athenee Comique, they straight
way take it for granted that the American
sense of propriety must be immeasurably
inferior to their own. Tliey do not realize
that the flirting is of the most innocent
character, that the independence i 3 nei
ther boldness nor "brass," but merely the
result of the different social conditions
that prevail in this country, and that if
American "misses" are aeeu at theaters to
which no French mother, be she grande
dame or petite bourgeoise, would bring
her unmarried daughter, it is because
they are%itterly incapable of fathoming
the true meaning of the indelicate but
witty play upon words which constitutes
the chief and only objectionable feature of
these entertainments.
Then, too, it cannot be denied that
Americans, like their English cousins,
allow themselves a considerably larger
amount of latitude abroad than at home
with regard to the conventionalities of
life. They look upon the trip to Europe
or the stay there in the light of a holiday
and their exuberance of spirits sometimes
gets the better of their discretion. Eng
lish people, for instance, will go to the
races and even to the theater on Sunday
when abroad, whereas they would hold ud
their hands with pious horror at the no
tion of dome anything of the kind at
home. So it is with many Americans on
the Continent of the Old World, who cross
the Atlantic with the feeling that among
strangers, away from the observant graze
of their fellow-citizen?, and above all free
from the prying eye of the American
press, which constitutes so healthy a re
straint upon their behavior, they can doff
for the nonce their strait waistcoat of
ultra- respectability and enjoy themselves
like boys and girls out for a holiday and
for a "real good time." This, too. is not
understood by the slay-at-home French
and all serves to warp their comprehension
of the correct 3tandard of American pro
priety.
With regard to the misconception that
prevails in the United Btates concerning
Gallic morality and delicacy, it is the
French themselves who are greatly to
blame, although some responsibility
doubtless attaches itself lo scribes ol the
class of the brilliant young American
author who, after six weeks' residence at
Paris spent according to his own admission
in lounging on the boulevards and haunt
ing resorts such as the Folies Bergeres
and the Moulin Rouge, wrote a book
about the French metropolis in whicli he
gravely asserted that even the most de
graded and abandoned women of the
American colony on the banks of the
Seine could never descend to the depths
of moral infamy of the best and most re
spected or the French wives ana mothers.
But tbe people who are chiefly responsi
ble for the reputation with which the
French are undeservedly saddled in this
country are a band of more or less distin
guished Parisian novelists, playwrights
and journalism. If the French have one
fault it is that they are wanting in hospi
tality in tbe American sense of the word.
They dp not throw open their hous3
to the stranger or admit him to the
intimacy of their family circle, even when
warmly commended by mutual friends.
The cmsequence is taat the real French
society â and by that I mean not only the
great world, but also the bourgeoisie â re
mains a terra incognita to the Amer
ican, whose only knowledge thereof
is derived from Parisian novels, plays
and newspapers. Now knavery is
always more interesting than honesty,
while virtue and morality present less at
traction to literary palates accustomed to
highly seasoned dishes than vice. As
books are written to catch tbe taste of the
reading public and plays are produced to
win the applause and the good will of the
theater-goers it naturally follows that the
theme of both one and the other is in
variably intrigue and immorality; and to
such an extent is this the case that tbe
foreigner ends by believing that French
life must necessarily be as it is portrayed
on the stage and in novels, that is to say
corrupt and rotten to the very core. This
impression is still further strengthened
by a perusal of the Parisian newspapers.
During the reign of King Louis Philippe
and subsequently throughout the eighteen
years of Napoleonic sway the press was
kept under very strict control, and the ut
most reserve was displayed in touching
upon any scandals of society, the Em
peror in particular holding tbat the pub
lication of unsavory news concerning the
great world was calculated to impair the
moral tone of the masses by showing
them that those whom they had
been taught to look upon as their
betters, and as a pattern of good behavior,
were unworthy of their co moderation and re
spect. That, according to Napoleon, served to
sap the very foundation and bulwarks of the
social system as now constituted. But since
j the war of 1870, the newspapers have been
I praciically free from any sort of censorship,
; and scandals tnat thirty years ago would have
been merely hinted at in the most vague man
ner, if indeed referred to at all, are now
shouted in stentorian tones from the very
housetops with a revolting abundance of
detail.
A large portion of the newspaper reading
public likes to learn evil about Its neighbors,
its friends and its acquaintances, and things
have come to such a pass that the worse the
scandal, the more valuable it is looked upon
as a piece of news for the press- Politics and
the ordinary intelligence, domestic as well as
foreign, are restricted, save in the case of the
Temps and the Debats. to the smallest and
most unobtrusive corners of the paper, while
items calculated to show up this or that par
ticular gra le of society in an especially bad j
light occupy the main portion of the sheer, i
Finally, one becomes so accustomed to look
for scandals in the French press, and to find
tnem, that the impression unconsciously grows
upon one that they constitute the only news J
in a Parisian paper, and that there is nothing
eood that can ever be recorded of French so
ciety, but only evil.
Yet if one were to take the files of a Parisian
newspaper ior a period of twelve months and j
count up the financial scandals related of men, I
the indiscretions and dramas la which the fair â 
sex have played the leading role, according to i
press accounts, one would find that the people
thus held up to popular reprobation do not
comprise more than 100, or iet us say at the
very most 200, persons occupying a place in
the aristocracy, in the official worid, in finance,
or among the well-to-do bourgeoisie, the names
occurringover and over again, nearly 50 per
cent of them belonging to foreigners. For it is j
only necessary to recall the fact that Baron
Reinach and Dr. Cornelius Herz, the two prin
cipal culprits in the Panama scanda!, were of
German birth, while the Princess whose j
divorce and subsequent attempts to appear at ;
the Folies Bergeres Theater in living pictures!
have been attracting so much attention is an!
American. Yet it is on the strength of the j
misconduct of this relatively infinitesimal I
number of individuals, some French, and the
other foreign, who are thus held up to public j
obloquy in the press, that the entire French
nation with a population of 40,000,000, is
branded as so corrupt, and so lacking on the
score oi morality, that, the word "French" here
in America has come to be regarded as
synonymous with "inGelicate."
Police experts and those who devote their
time to the study oi crime and of social prob
lems relating thereto do not. hesitate to ex
press the very decided opinion that there is
immeasurably more social corruption at Ber
lin, at Vienna, St. Petersburg, and even in
Stockholm, than at Paris, while Brussels has
achieved for herself an undesirable promi
nence over all the other cities of the world as
the principal source of all the volume of liter
ary iilth which Beelzebub inspires degenerate
scribes to write for the contamination of inno
cence and purity. But every one of those
capitals just mentioned make a point of ob
serving the maxim of De La Rochefoucauld,
and keep as far as possible a veil of mystery
over their misdoings, the scandals which they
print in their newspapers relating exclusively
to occurrences abroad and to foreigners, a dis
creel silence being observed in connection
with those happening nearer home. One may
search the Berlin journals and those of Vienna
in vain fcr any unsavory gossip concerning
the German aristocracy or about the Austrian
great world. But you will find in their col
umns the tallest details concerning the scan
dals of the hour in Madrid, Vienna, Paris or
St. Petersburg. Parisian newspapers, on the
other hand, are apparently never so happy as
when fouling their own nest, and as when
holding up the moral shortcomings of their
own countrymen in an exaggerated form, ana
in a far too highly colored light, to the gaze of
the entire world.
It will doubtless astonish many people in
America to learn that nowhere in Europe
does respectability count for so much as
among the French middle and lower classes,
while the great world of France attaches equal
importance to what it describes as "correct
ness" of conduct, speech and manner. If Felix
Faure, and before him Casimir Perier and
Sadi-Carnot were elected by the suffrages of
their countrymen to the Chief Magistracy of
the republic, it was mainly because, of all the
rival candidates tor that high office, they were
held to come nearest to the national ideal of
respectability and "correctness." These are
two qualities which are Invariably preferred
by the French to brilliancy, to wit and to
smartness of intellect, and nowhere are ir
regularities of conduct visited with more
serious consequences to a public man, or
viewed with greater severity by the people -at
large, than in France. That was indeed the
cause of the lamentable failure and fall of
President Grevy. The fact that his domestic
relations prior to tho fall of the empire
had not been of an altogether regular
characterâ a fact of which no one was aware
at the time of his election as Chief Magis
trateâwas forever being brought to bear
against him, and it was solely due to similar
Ciuses that the late M. Challemel-Laeour, the
cleverest Frenchman who ever held office un
der the third republic, was on three separate
occasions defeated by overwhelming majori
ties in his efforts to secure the Presidency.
This high price set upon respectability is to be j
found in every class of French society, and it !
is but a year aso that a retired revenue officer, 1
who, like his father and grandfather before
him, had been decorated with the Legion of
Honor and pensioned off after nearly two
score years of subaltern service to the State.
was indicted i'or having murdered His repro
bate son in consequence of the young man
having brought disgrace upon tne honor of the
name of a family which though humble had
been noted throughout three generations for
its respectability.
In conclusion let me state that strict obser
vance of the marriage ties is the rule in French
families, and not the exception as people here
seem to believe. Indeed, the family relations
are perhaps even more close nnd more inti
mate in France than in America, owing to the
fact that there is infinitely less independence
on the part of the wife, the daughters and the
sons. The latter even when grown up and
gray rannot contract a marriage without the
parental sanction, ana the fact that no one
could have ever thought of modifying the law
upon the subject shows conclusively the ex
tent to which the filial sentiment prevails in i
France.
New York is not America, nor is Paris
France. Both cities are infinitely too cosmo
politan to serve as a sampl â¢ or standard of the
character of their respective countries. And!
if the French were to know a little more of
America than they do at presentâ of America
that lies beyond the limits of New York, and
if on the other hand the Americans were to
possess a more extensive acquaintance of
France than can be derived from French
novels, plays, newspapers and from brief
visits to Paris, we should no longer find the
words "bien Americain" used in France to
designate things that are indelicate, nor the
latter described in this country as "so very
French." j Ex-Attache.

A NEW ESSAY IN DIDACTIC FICTION.
TROOPER PETKK HAi KET DF M ASHONA-
I. ANDâ By Olive xhr'intr. Boston: Roberts
Bros. For sale by William Doxey, Palace Hotel.
Jus: how far an author is justified in making
fiction a vehicle for didactics is still an open
question. It wi.l probably never be closed
while Mrs. Humphry V'ard lives and writes,
and if Mrs. Humphry AVard may write stories
with purpose poiiticai or polemical, the same
privilege must certaiuly be conceded to other
writers.
â For this reason Oliver Schreiner's latest
book, Trooper Peter Halket of Mashona
lÂ«nd," must b-.- noticed as fiction, though
justice demands the concession that no child
ue nioro innocent than Mme. Schreiner
c real art of fiction.
The worth of the sort of story she has given
us is more easily passed upon than is the
question of its justification. It 1s doubtful if
any great ethical lesson was ever taught to
- under the story gui~e that could not
have been better and more broadly taught by
a simple, direct treatment of the subject itself.
The nature of fiction is such as to preclude j
but a narrow and onf-sided view of the
mailer? which it treats, when these are of
tt,enise:ves outside its realm. The vehicle Is
â¢ncted, its limitations too rigidly de
le admit of the broad, general view
n considering great questions. Had
reiner seen fit to give th*> world a
ent "f the truth aoout ihe preseut situ
ation in South Africa, it is probable that
the world would have listened to her. Theau
personality is well known; her reputa
tion Â«nd ncr long residence in the country of
-he writes are enough to secure her a
hearing, and a consideration that will never
teaecorded to "Trooper Peter Halket," whose
news of the African situation are at first those
oi an ignorant English lad, not yet of age,
who less than eighteen months before had
"never heard of Mashonaland."
Late- in the story we find him acting from i
the point of view of a man who has spent a
:;:'gh: alone amid the terrors of the veld, the
great African plain; who on that night was
nearly starved and frozen, and who "has
never been the same man since," according to
the verdict of his comrades in arms, who
could not be expected to know that during
that night of horror the Christ visited Peter's
campfire. showed him that the despised Afri
can natives were his brethren, and seat him
!or;h on a mission for their rescue.
Here again the limitations of fiction draw
hard and fast lines about the task to which
-Mine. Schreiner has set herself, and the main
â vie of the story, which is justice to the Afri
can, is lost sight of in the inevitable specula
tion over the artistic unities of the Christ
nature, as sketched by the author. Such a
handling of themes is always delicate and
daneerous. Dangerous because our concep
tions of tbs divine must necessarily be in
ventive rather than imaginative, and the line
between sublimity and absurdity is so faintly
defined as to be easily crossed.
Fortunately for her readers, the author
keeps well up on the right side of this line, and
yet. while we may not truly measure the great
ness of any work or movement by apparent re
sults, there is, in view of the story's weakness,
something almost grotesque in the spectacle
of the machinery which she has set in motion
to carry on the action of her narrative. The
introduction into it of Cecil Rhodes and Dr.
Jameson is but one of the many artistic blun
ders that characterize the book as a work of
fiction. So also the reproduction as an illus
tration to ttoe story of a photograph represent
ing a group of white men watching three ne
groes hanging from a tree is an offense against
ihe decencies which not even earnestness ef
purpose can justify.
It is only as a work of fiction that adverse
criticism applies to the book. Olive Schreiner
is a woman who has toucned life at many
points, and gathered from it a real message
for the world. She has insight and sympathy,
and ttie power to make her readers think and
feel. There is, moreover, a certain high
imaginative quality in her work that arouses
and carries. There i^ much of the same fine
force in "Trooper Peter Halket" that holds us
in "Dreams" and other oi her best work, but
with thiÃ remains, as well, much of the
crudity, the one-ideaed intensity tbat charac
terized "The story of an African Farm." It is
hardly possible that she regards all English
men in Africa as oppressors and brutes, yet
there is little in the book to relieve this
gloomy impression. The story itself is hope
less and inconclusive. From first to last it
contains no word of hope or cheer. Yet ont
cannot but recognize that the author has
spoken out of a sense of hurt justice and in be
haif of the weak.
As with a'l of Mme. Schreiner's work the
central teaching is Individual and internal
rntiier than outward and general. She sums
it up in the parting words of the divine
stranger at Peter Halket' s campfire: "It is not
the act but the will that marks the soul of the
man. He who has crushed a nation sins no
more than he who rejoices in the death throe
oi the meanest creature. The siagnant pool is
not less poisonous droj. for drop than the
mighty swamp, though its reach be smaller.
He who has desired to be and accomplish what
this man has been and accomplished is as
ihis man, though he have lacked the power
to perform."

STAGE GOSSIP.
LIFE OF LAURA KKENK-By John Crea
hÂ»n. Philadelphia: The Rogers Publishing
Company.
A very poorly edited work is this life of the
noted actress. Jt reads as if a mass of matter
had been turned over to the printer to fling
together in a hurry, and let orderly arrange
ments, captims and introductions be, to a
large extent, omitted as superfluities. Never
theless whosoever delves deep into the book
will find treasures of interest therein to repay
him for his trouble. Laura Keene had many
diligently cultivated talents as actress,
artist, manager, editor and lecturer, which
make tne records of her life worth examining.
She had a very imperious nature, and mingled
with her greatness were some frailties of
temper which are amusing, especially when
the gossip about them involves the names of
other noted stage people.
Joe Jefferson gave an entertaining account
ef a quarrel he had with the irascible footlight
qneen, but shows at the same time that he had
a sincere liking for her. Amen; innumerable
tiffs with her professional colleagues was an
exceptionally amusing one, in which the well-
I known actor Sothern. who created the roll of
Lord Dundreary, figured as the other principal.
She "got mad" with him at a renearsal and be
gan to rate him soundly in her dressing-room,
whither he had been ordered. Sotheru said,
"Stop, Laura; stop just a minute"; and ad
vancing to the light he deliberately turned it
down. "What do you mean by that, sir?" she
raged. "Oh, nothing; but you have always
been so lovely to me that I can't bear to look
upon your beautiful face when you are in a
passion." It is interesting to note that Laura
Keens told this story herself.
STORY OF UNSELFISH LOVE>
MISS ARCHER ARCHER â By Clara Louise
Bnrnnam. Boston and New York: Honghton,
illffln&CO. Price *1 28. '* i
A very pretty story of four people who are
willing to sacrifice their own happiness at the
demands of honor, but who are saved from the
necessity of bo doing by a lucky and unusual
combination of circumstances. To us poor
humans it would seem a pity that life cannot
always be arranged with such a felicitous out
come. The tangle of love and friendship in
which the young people find themselves is
very painful while it endures, but happily
there results a joyous extrication for all. Miss
Archer Archer is a Virginia girl, of a family
proud of its blood. She is represented as
charming and lovable, and the woman with
whom her love affairs get mixed up is a Phil
adelphian of very different manners and
speech. The way the ice' gradually thaws be
tween these two representatives of North and
South is very cleverly toid.
It is noticeable that Miss Archer Is made to
use a style of English rather more provincial
than would probably be employed by a girl of
her social station. This is particularly true in
regard to such expressions as "I reckon, "which
in type are apt to give an impression of illiter
acy. Owing to difficulity in rendering her
Southern speech it takes the reader several
chapters to learn to admire Miss Archer, and
probably this would be a counterpart of an
actual experience if one accustomed only to
the Northern accent was thrown in the com
pany of Southern girls. Miss Barnham is
happy in her sketches of Virginia negroes.
SERIOUS FICTION.
THE WISDOM OF FOOLSâ By Margaret Deland.
Boston and New York: Hougbton, Mifflin <fc Co.
Price Â«1 25.
Some very deep proDiems are taken under
consideration in the four short stories con
tained in this book. In one of them called
j "The Law aDd the Gospel" the wisdom or folly
1 of trying to keep alive the hereditarily im
moral is discussed by the narration of how a
young woman with a philanthropic bias
saves a wanton from death by her care and
money. The beneficiary of her bounty re
forms till she fully recovers her health and
spirits and then Immediately suffers a moral
relapse. In her second fall she drags down a
promising young boy, who is the idol of his
widowed mother. A physician in the story
argues with the philanthropist that she
should have let the wanton die of neglect and
used all the force providence granted her in
helping the virtuous. Pros and cons are force
fully put, and the author leaves the problem
unsolved, unless we are to consider the title
of the story as indicating the bias of the
writer's mind; that the physician represents
the law and the philanthropist the gospel.
The principal story in the volume is culled
"Where Ignorance Is Bliss 'Tis Folly to Be
Wise," and in it is much argument as to whether
a man should or should not confess the sins of
his early life to the woman he is engaged to
marry. The principal character in the story,
who is a pastor and presented as a thoughtful
man, holds that the human soul is essentially
solitary, and that there must be reserves â
cept with the Deity. Unless justice and repa
ration demand it, confession is a flab% vanity
and is unhealthy for the mind. The woman
to whom he is engaged differs from him, hold
ing that t silence would be accepting respect
and love under false pretenses. The story is
cleverly told and the author presents no an
swer to her riddle, preferring to let the reader
puzzle It out.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
The credit for exposing the misdeeds of Cecil Rhodes in South Africa and the rottenness of the Kaffir mining excitement in London be
longs to Olive Schreiner, a woman of genius, who was born at a little missionary station in Cape Colony. She made a great hit over ten
years ago with a novel entitled "The Story of an African Farm, "published under the pseudonym of Ralph Iron. This she followed with a
book of allegories called "Dreams." In the story of her life she says that she was a big gin before she had ever seen a town or any ot the
ordinary evidences of civilization. But she knew South Africa thoroughly, and when she came to woman's estate she saw many instances
of the cruelty to the blacks as well as of injustice to the Boers. Her father wars a Dutch missionary and her mother was an Englishwoman ;
she seems to have all the imgination of a recluse and a mystic, but she appears also to have some good common-sense, for when London
went wild over the rapid advance in the K;iffir mining shares she sounded the wnrning that brought the gambling to a sudden stop and
nearly created a panic. She gave the facts and figures proving that nine-tenths of the South African mines listed on the London Mining
Stock Exchange were undeveloped, and that many did not even consist of a hole in tho ground. Her onslaught was so sudden and so over
whelming that Barney Barnato and the other agents of Rhodes were nearly swept off their feet.
Recently she has been carrying on a campaign in Cspe Colony which has ior its object the enlistment cf the women in ncr fight against
Rhodes. She married a member of Parliament named Kronwright, but as he regards her as the more prominent member of the family he
has considerately added her name to his, and now they are known as Mr. and Mrs. Kronwright-Schreiuer. She is now engaged in making
speeches, writing articles and carrying on what South Africa has named a "petticoat" campaign, with the help of her husband and women
in South Africa, to keep Cecil Khodes out of tbe governing business. There are a few newspapers to assist her. The editors call Rhodes
a villain end a tyrant Rhodes before his downfall bothered them by not paying any attention to them. They did not own many shares
of mining stock.
Mrs. Schreiner believes that Rhodes is largely responsible for the present state of affairs. He has made money the god of South Africa.
He is enslaving the poor and making the rich more ri'.'h. She deplores that in this new country, where socialism should be feasible, the
conditions in tbe old nations are resulting. To her the idea tbat one man should simply own such an enormous amount of the virgin soil
aud of mineral wealth, which belongs as much to one man as another, is atrocious and not to be endured.
AMERICA'S BOOK MARKET.
For a score of years the (Jnited States has
been berated for the Inequality of its copy
right laws and the injustice done thereby to
foreignâ that is, Britishâ writers. The result
Is that a law was passed which operates to
give the English writer a great advantage over
the American author without securing ade
quate equivalent The American author's
work must be published first in England, or
simultaneously in England and the United
States, to obtain a British copyright, while the
British writer can publish his work at home
and wait a year for offers and opportunities to
publish it in the United States.
As a result, tbe American market has been
overcrowded with English work and the
American author has been shut out of fair
competition in the home market This condi
tion has been intensified by the Anglo mania
which has come to pervade every department
of American thought, except scientific inves
tigation and material invention. The wor
ship of things English has been carried to
such an extent as to become as serious i. ques
tion in American literature as in American
manufacture. The American buys English
goods of all sorts, from cloths to books, in
preference to American ones, because they
are not American. The Englishman reverses
this rule; he buys English goods and English
books because they are English. The only
w ay for an American author to get an Ameri
can audience is to get an English market
first. American literature, l.ke American
whisky, is thought to be afflicted with "raw
ness" until it has been across the sea.
This was curiously illustrated in the case of
Stephen Crane's "Red Badge of Courage," an
utterly impossible picture of an impossible
man in an impossible battle, which was sup
osed to represent the experience of a vol
unteer soldier in our Civil War. As the lead
ing character was a climacteric coward, who
bad nothing to do In battle except scrutinise
his own sensations; as it was a battle with
out purpose or discipline, conducted mMnly
as a pyrotechnic display, and culminated in
an inconceivable coward being converted into
the most insouciant fighter by an impossible
contact with an impossible skeleton, it took
the fancy of the English people as a realistic
picture of the American volunteer soldier.
As soon as it received English approval, onr
American press began to boom it, until this
OLIVE SCHRIINIR.
product of a fancy whose nearest approach to
the realism of battle is the sensations which
accompany the exploit of "painting the town
red" seems likoiy to take rank as the Ameri
can literary ideal of the American volunteer
soldier. Happy is the veteran who died child
less before this slushy daub came to stand in
American appreciation for the soldier; before
palpitating cowardice assumed "the badge of
courage."
A still more recent exposition of this result
of the unfortunate tendency of our people 1b
found in an experiment made by the Book
man, in which the Immense preponder
ance of British over American works sold by
booksellers is sbown by reports from fifty
leading dealers. Commenting on this, tbe
Academy (London) says: "They are worth
study, lor tuey show the hold which British
books have obtained over the American read
ing public. And the wonder grows that &
nation of eager readers should be depending
so largely for its entertainment upon the
writers of another nation, even allowing for
the unity of speech that exists between Eng
land and America. Never, certainly, has one
country supplied anotner with new literature
at tbe rate and in the volume that England is
supplying the United States. Never has one
country fastened on and studied the current
literature of another country with tne gener
ous eagerness of America buying the litera
ture of England. Observe, we are speaking
strictly of current literature. Tho devotion
of Americans to our classics is devotion to
wnat is their own. Tbe astonishing thing is
that American readers look to England for
ephemeral as well as classical literature.
Over there the book of tbe hour and the
book of tbe century are alike English. One
understands why Shakespeare has not been
ousted by an American genius; but why is
there so much room for lan Maclaren and
Mr. Barrie? Why, moreover, is no literary
happening in London, no bubble reputation,
no quarrel of author and publisher, no rival
ries of editors, no personal peculiarity of a
second-rank writer too remote or trivial to be
paragraphed with gusto in New York, Boston
ana Philadelphia? We write broadlyâ not
forgetting American writers, but rather re
membering them with compassion. For
surely the lists printed by the Bookman com
pel compassion for the American story-writer
who remains in Ametica. Ah, but how sel
dom he does remain then I Henry James and
Marlon Crawford and Harold Frederic and
Bret Harte and Mark Twain and John Oliver
Hobbes are all in Europe I"
The men named, as well as many others of
our writers, have learned that the road to
American favor lies through English ap
proval. It is not American authors alone who
are to be pitied, but the American people.â

in Colorado, well illustrated with views of
Pine Valley and Bald Mountain. Mr. France
is good at portraying the tenderness and
nobleness that often underlie the rough ex

IN A QUEER COMMUNITY.
PERFECTION CITYâ By Mrs. Orpen. New
York: D. Appleton A Co. For sale in this City
by William Doxey, Palace Hotel. Price 60 cents.
This little story tells of an attempt at com
munity Jife on the prairies, and how a sweet
young woman tried-it, not through favor of
the theories of socialism, but because she
loved a man who was a member of the society.
This throws her into contact with a number of
odd characters, whose portrayal is the book's
main purpose.
HERE AND THERE.
Sir Walter Besant has had the grip, but is
now convalescent. He is revising his new
story, "A Fountain Sealed," which Chatto <fc
Windus will publish.
Ouida's last fiction is called "The Massa
renes," and Messrs. Sampson Low & Co. are
the publishers. It has to do with a duchess
and a pork-butcher, and the pig-man is an
American, who is a great swell.
If word from Washington can be credited,
Mrs. Grant has written the home story of her
life with her illustrious husband. But
whether tbe matter is to be published at once
or after her death is not known.
It was Thackeray who wrote at Athens in
1845: "I swear solemnly thai I would rather
have two hundred a year in Fieet street than
be King of the Greeks, with Basieus written 1
before my name round their beggarly coin."
Ibsen's honors came late to him. He has
just celebrated his sixty-ninth birthday. Ii"
there was any difference between Ibsen and
his son-in-lmw, Bjornson, there was a recon
ciliation on this* occasion. On his seventieth
birthday a Berlin publisher will issue a superb
edition of Ibsen's works.
Mr. Bryan (there is but one Mr. Bryan) is go
ing to give his first book to tha world. Its
title is "The First Battle," and in England
Sampson Low, so it is reported, will be the
publisher. It is Mrs. Bryan who writes a
sketch of her husband, and the bulk of the
volume will be made up of Mr. Bryan's
speeches.
Captain Mahan's "Life of Nelson" is a liter
ary event in England, the publishers of the
English edition (Me^rs. Sampson Low & Co.)
having in process ot manufacture a large new
edition. In this eulogy of the greatest of
naval heroes the Englishman is forced to ac
cept "fcarbor" without "v" and "splendor"
bereft in thesame wav, but your Briton will get
used to all that before very long.
Most of us know of M. Victorien~Bardou's
early studies. He was to have been a doctor,
and his means were so res^tricied that he gave
lessons in Greek and Latin at 20 cents a
ticket Sardou was -also a bookseller's hack,
and made translations. It is stated that foi
one job he undertook, over which he labored
for three weeks, working moat of nis time in
the National Library, he was paid 32 francsâ
that is, less than $6 50.
Once the printer took the liberty of correct
ing a line of Cowper's, and the poet wrote:
"There is a roughnjss on a plum which nobody
who understands fruit would rub off, though
the plum would be much more polished with
out it â¢ â¢ â¢ I will only add that 1 wish you
to guard me from all such meddling, assuring
you that I always write as smoothly ns I can,
but that I never did, never will, sacrifice the
spirit or sense of a passage to the sound of it"
In connection with the death of Dr. Brewer
an interesting fact is recorded by the London
Literary World concerning his "Guide to Sci
ence," which well illustrates tbe speculative
nature of book publishing. Dr. Brewer orig
inally offered the work to Messrs. Jarrold of
Norwich, England, for Â£50, who refused the
offer, but afterward agreed to issue it on a
royally of a penny in the shilling for the copy
right A little later Dr. Brewer offered Â£4000
to get back his rights in it. His yearly Income
from royalties on tbe book has been a rood
deal more than the modest Â£50 for which he
offered it at first.
Mr. Harris, who was so dread folly mixed about
Charles sum ncr Is wriggling all he knows how to
get out of the snarl. His explanation is that be
did not mean t-harles Sumner, but Iharles a.
Mimnercf Californiaâ and who might Chanes A.
sumner be?
The foregoing is from the New York Times,
usually accurate and well informed. Query:
Who is "Mr. Harris?" Or perhaps our contem
porary refers to the pessimistic Hawels? And
for information as to "Who might Charles A.
Sumner be," the Times might turn to Lan
man's Biographical Annals of the Civil Gov
ernment of the United States (edition of 1887),
page 485.
Are literary people so singularly constructed
that their habits or fads should be particu
larly signalized? What does it avail us to
know that Smith had a mania for accumu
lating old slippers, or that Jones collects
tops and marble \ or that Robinson's entire
leisure is devoted to the finding of mus
tard spoons? Suppose the favorite recre
ation of Miss Angelica la to play blind
man's buff or Copenhagen, or Miss Eudoxla
to turn handsprings, or that the historian
Williamson eats a pound of mint-stick every
twenty-four hours? What can an intelligent
oublic care about such things? "This 'ere
wild man," said the proprietor of the side
show, "devours, ladies and gents, ten pound
of raw onions sprinkled with red pepper
every blessed mornln' as a happetizer before
his regular bre'kfus' of seven bucketfuls of
sheep's trotters and tripe. He's a very ex
pensive animal as to his boardin'."
Some weeks asro tbe Academy gave a por
trait of Walter Savage Landor, with a sketch
of his life, and received later a letter ad.
dressed to "Walter Savage Landor Esq.,"
which read: "Sir: We are very anxious
to inclnde your portrait in our 'Series
of Celebrities,' and should be very
pleased if you could kindly grant as a sit
ting for the purpose at your convenience,
especially as only a few minutes will be
required. We shall be happy to take you
any time that you may be able to appoint,
and we will, of course, send copies of the por
traits for your Inspection before making use
of them in any way. We are, sir, yours faith
fully, â " Not long ago a journal gave
some space to the description of a fine fiddle
attributed to Stradivarius. A few days after
ward the paper received a letter from New
Jersey, which ran as follows: "Mr. Editor:
You did not print Mr. Stradivarius' address,
and I have looked all over your paper for his
advertisement. If be will send me a violin on
trial, he might find a cash customer."
There is an old Spanish maxim which reads,
"Seldom lend your horse to a sailor, never to
a Frenchman, and as little as you can to any
body else." As to obliging a friend with a book
the wisdom of the proverb holds equally good.
Mr. Arthur L. Humphrey in the Private Library
formulated certain rules regarding books
and their treatment, brought forth one might
say by "dire experience.'' Here are some of
tbe principal ones: "Do not bite your paper
knife until it has the edge of a saw. Do not
cut books except with a proper ivory paper
knife. It is ruination to a good book not
to cut It right through into the cor
ners. Do not turn the leaves ot books
down; particularly do not turn down tne
leaves of books printed on plate paper.
If you are In the habit of lending books do
not mark them; these two habits together
constitute an act of indiscretion. It is better
to give a book than to lend it Never write
upon a title page or half title; tbe blank fly
leaf is tho right place. Books are neither
card racks, crumb baskets nor receptacles for
dead leaves. Books were not meant as cush
ions, nor were they meant to be toasted before
a fire."

Drummondat Edinbuigh University, and a
life-long friend, these memoirs of one of the
most brilliant men of our day from the pen of
the author of "Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush"

Mrs. Hays Hammond's account of events at
Johannesburg during the Jameson raid will
be published shortly in this country and Eng
land by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. Mra.
Hammond calls tne volume "A Woman's Part
in a Revolution." It consists mainly in ex
tracts from a diary which she kept with great
diligence during the period described. The
particular interest of the book is that it will
give us a woman's view of Johannesburg dur
ing the rising and afterward.
On the question of how to save the fur seals
the Review of Reviews takes the ground that
President Jordan's recommendations Miould
be heeded at once, and that, without waiting
fo- England's sanction, the United States
should absolutely prohibit American citizens
from engaging at any season of the year in
the taking of seals in the open sea. The
Review also urges that, if other means fail, to
make pelagic sealing unprofitable, all the
young female seals on the Pribilof Islands
should be branded in such a manner as to
make their fur valueless. The females being
thus protected, the herd would maintain itself,
The Macrniilan Company have scored an*
other success in their new book entitled "The
Port of Missing Ships and Other Stories of the
Sea," of which a second edition is already on
the press. The first in the book is the strange
story told in a hospital by the only survivor of
a midocean collision between the Atlantic, a
big steam packet, and the Nucleus, a full
rigged ship. Neither vessel was ever heard
from until through the broken revelations of
this dying sailor. In strong contrast is the
tale of the racing ships whose captains were
rivals in the eyes of their owner's daughter â
her favor promised to the winning man. No
less interesting, yet different from either, is
"The Story of a Second Male." The cover de
sign is also worthy a word of notice, being
quite out of the ordinary.
The May Month will contain portraits of Mr.
and Mrs. Richard Henry Stoddard and their
son, Lorimer Stoddard (the dramatizer of
"Tess"), Ferdinand Bruetiere, Mme. Blanc,
Henry B. Fuller, the Chicago novelist; our
new Embiissadors to England, France and Ger
many, John Hay, General Horace Porter and
Dr. Andrew D. White â a portrait of Embassa
dor Hay, taken especially for The Month, form*
ing the frontispiece; Henry Drummond, ex-
Postmaster-General William L Wilson, who
has been elected president of Washington
and Lee University; Oliver Optic, Nelson,
Captain Mahau (whose "Life oi Nelson" is re
viewed by Admiral Luce, U. S. N.); Alfred
Austin, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Dvorak,
Lafcadio Hearn, Austin Dobson, Maurus Jokai,
Dr. Bourinat and Frederick Walker (the origi
nal of dv Maurier's "Little Billee"), besides
reproductions of the May magazine posters
and other illustrations.
Special features in Current Literature for
May are illustrated articles in addition to the
presence of pictures in some of the regular de
partments. In the Editor's Symposium in the
May number ot Current Literature Mr. Cable
gives his readers more of patriotism than of
mere literature, "Crete and Cuba," "The
Patriotism of Ideas" and "Cosmopolitan Patri
otism" being some of the subjects he discusses.
Hamilton W. Mabie continues his series of
literary essays with an interesting paper on
the "Growth of Historical Study," and F. M.
Hopkins, in his department of American
Poets of To-Day, writes this month of Louise
Imogen Guiney, and quotes from her works.
The fiction in the May number of Current Lit
erature, aside from the clever selections in the
Sketch Book, Is represented by extracts from
the much-talked-of recent publications, Ibsen's
play, "John Gabriel Borkman," and Olive
Schreiner's "Trooper Peter Halket of Mathona
land." A special article has also been con
tributed to the magazine on the political and
religious questions involved in Miss Schrei
ner's book. Besides the many Interesting spe
cial articles the May number of Current Lit*
erature has its regular departments filled at
usual with the best current verse and prose.
The May issne of Godey's Magazine is nota
ble for many special articles of timely inter*
est. The leading contribution is "Washington
Favorites," by Carolyn Halstead, and gives a
brief sketch of the prominent society ladies
of the capital. The photographs which accom
pany the article are very attractive. Follow*
ing this is an article on "Power Boats," which
discusses the gas engine and electric-yacht
question in a very interesting manner. This
article is illustrated with many pictures, and
is unique among magszine papers. "A Eulogy
of the Vaudeville" covers the recent develop
ments which have marked the dramatic stage
and calls attention to much that is worth con*
slot-ring. The article is illustrated with pic
tures of prominent actors.
"American Literary Diplomats" tells of tha
prominent journalists and literary men who
have held foreign ofhee under the Government.
It is illustrated fully and is quite sugges
tive at this stage of our National and political
development. The leading fiction piece of the
issue is "A Florentine Rose," by Anna W.
Young, an intensely dramatic tale. There are
six other stories in the issue and five excel
lent poem*. Among the noteworthy articles
of jieneral interest are papers on "American
L-iLvmaking, ""Mushroom Hunting," "Church
Music" and "Amateur Bookmaking," all finely
illustrated, and the first of Grace E. Drew's
series on "The Decoration and Furnishing oi
the Modern Home.''

A Perilovs Position.
Bt E. G. Wedgwood.
About two years ago. while living in
the little town of D , I had a very excit
ing experience.
Like most boys, after reading of hair
breadth escapes by land and tea, or by tire
and water, I wished very much to be tbe
hero of some real blood-curdling adven
ture.
My home was near the banks of a
mountain stream, in whicn. were many
trout.
I was very fond of fishing, and when
ever I could, would take my rod and
follow up the stream, then cross over to
the river and fish down until I reached
home.
One fine Saturday I shouldered my rol
and started out for a happy time of sport,
little thinking that I should get all the
adventure I wished during the next few
hours.
I was very successful and soon had a
fine string of finny beauties.
Nothing unusual happened until I had
descended the river for about two mile*
on my homeward journey, at a point

where the water dashed and roared
through a narrow opening In the rocky
cliffs into a deep hole far below.
The cliffs rose to a height of about a
hundred feet and were steep and slippery;
one aide being very smooth, while from
the other, narrow ledges jutted out here
and there. One of these ran across the cliff
and was used as a path, which varied in
wi.ith nil the way from about three inches
to a foot and a half. Patches of moss
clung to the rocki in places. As I had
crossed over on the ledge so many times
before, no thought of danger entered mv
mind, and after winding my line and
slinging my string of fish over my shoul
der I went merrMy on, going slowly of
course. When I had gotten safely half
way over 1 suddenly heard the awful
warning of the presence of a rattlesnake,
and sure enough my horror-stricken eyes
- sis- rE& ' Tot stood in "the

saw coiled on the ledee in tront of me a
monstrous fellow almost ready to spring.
Of course I did not care to do battle with
a rattlesnake on a narrow ledge, so I began
to retreat, backing first, then turning.when
the ledge was wide enough to allow rue to
do so. 1 nad no more than just turned
when I saw another rattlesnake coming
toward me and covering up my retreat.
I turned again toward home, determining
to kill the first one and then cross before
the other came up. I held on to the cliff
with my left hand and grasping my rod
firmly with my right brought it down
with all the force I could on the snake's
head, with what result I Know not, for
the rock which I had jrrnsped could not
stand the strain, and broke loose, pitching
me headlong down the cliff.
At a point about thirty feet down grew
a little pine tree, and I was fortunate
enough to be caught by-its branches, and
soon succeeded in getting a firm hold, but
I saw that the soil around its roots was
very loose and knew that it would not
long be able to bear my weight, and I cer
tainly would be dashed to pieces on the
rocks below.
I need not say that I called loudly for
help, and kept scraping the cliff with my
feet as I tried to climb up. While doing
this I struck a little ledge a few inches

wide and about a foot lone. By resting
my feet on this, part of the strain was re
lieved, but it was still terrible, and as my
lingers were fast becoming very numb, I
knew I could not hold on ten minutes
longer.
All at once 1 heard a dog barking and
whining above me, and then the welcome
sound of my brother Willies voice.
My courage revived and I began to shout
louder than ever, explaining my position
to him as best I could.
He grasped the situation quickly, and
lost no time in getting off his leather
coat and cutting it into strips. Of these
he rnaii â¢ a rope. First tying a noose in
one end, he threw it to me. With much
difficulty I succeeded in slipping the
noose around my waist and then, partly
by scrambling and partly by being pulled
up, I finally iound myself safe once more
on the ledge.
When I reached borne I was none the
worse for my adventure, with the excep
tion of having received some scratches
and a very bad scare.
Fortunate for me, indeed, was the fact
of my brother Willies having been hunt
ing that day in the vicinity of the cliffs,
and I think that you will agree with me
that he and not I was tne hero of that
day's adventure.
Dorothy and Srotty.
Dorothy is a three-year-old girlie.
Scotty is a dear little Scotch terrier â a
muss ol silky hair, out of which glow and
glisten two bright, brown eyes.
When the girlie comes out in the morn
ing she greets the great, dewy, green
world around her with: "Where's my
yope? I want to get my borsie, cause I
mua do to town wight away and det aome

reach away tip high, gets the rope down
from ihe naii and gives it to her.
With a happy little chuckle she trots
off to where the fat doggie lies snapping
at flies. Up he jumps to meet her, and
she soon has one end of the rope tied fast
around his neck; and with the other end
heid tight by chubby bands, driver and
horsie are ready to start.
"Det op. Scotty; det up, I say!" and
the fat doggie "dets up' 1 as last as he can.
"Oh, what fun! How they roll and
tumble along! Up and down the long
porches; in and out the pleasant kitchen
to the barn; down the hill and up again,
making the piggies run squealing to their
mothers, setting chickens to cackling and
scattering them to the right and to the
left, and acaring poor pussy up a tree.
At last fccotty gets tired and wants to
stop playing horse and be a doggie again.
So he watches his chance, and when his
mistress, loosens her hold on the rope a
little, he gives it a sudden jerk, which
pulls it riclit out of her hand.
Then the sly fellow, quick as a flash,
grabs it by the end with his mouth, and
after giving the astonished iittlo girl a sly
look scampers off to a safe hiding-place,
holding ttie rope tight with his teeth all
the time.
He has a fine rest, and does not ven
ture to show himself again until Dorothy
in taking her noonday nap. Then he
comes and rubs himself up against her
mamma's dress so hard that she has to
stop her work and take the rope off his
neck. He watches her closely then untH
he sees her bang it on its nail, where be
knows it is far out of Dorothy's reach;

then be walks off with an air of great im
portance, wagging his tail and ready to

A Creaking ar\d a Squeaking.
When you hear a creaking, creaking,
And a real ear-splitting squeaking.
At of some one vengeance wreaking
Oa the poor old garden gate,
Theu you know that we are coming,
And you all come running, running
Out to meet us at tbe garden gate.
But to-day, when we are coming,
No one will come running, running,
None to meet us will be coming;
None will seek the garden gate.
No one hears the creaking, creaking,
No one smiles at squeaking, squeaking,
As of poor, neglected barnyard gate.
Would you know the awful reason
Of this seeming heartless treason,
Of this sad, heart-breaking season
And the absence of the squeak?
Papa made a resolution
To effoct a revolution,
And when oiled our Dugjry ceased to

Star and Her Pets.
Star is a little girl who is very fond of
all God's living creature*, and sees beauty
and wonder in tbe tiniest worm.
When she was very young she liktd all
kinds of bugs so well that sha would often
crawl ont under tbe bushes and catch at
many as she could.
Bhe passed many happy hours wtfh ants,
moths, spiders and grasshoppers. Strangs
playfellows for a baby, weren't they ?
Caterpillars interested her very much,
and when ehe was old enough she closely
studied their habits.

spun their cocoons and then after a while
of sleep appear in the beautiful robes of
the butterfly.
One day her papa brought her home a
turtle, and it soon became a great pet.
Star laughed heartily every time she saw
him bury himself in the earth.
Then, too, she had a lizard BDd a horned
toad. Their favorite amusement was
catching flies, and they loved to lie in the
sun half covered with warm sand.
By the time- Star was 7 years old she
had a curious and varied collection of
grasshoppers, bees, beetles, butterflies and
moths which she had neatly moun.ed on
card p.
She is now 9 years old and has some
larger pets, among them being a pair of
chipmunks and a pair of pretty black and
white long-eared rabbits.
The chipmunks are very cute, and they
frisk around so lively that the dog thinks
they are rats and tries bard to get at them,
for he is a fine ratter.
The rabbits have a house all by them
selves, and she calls them "her little
dears," and says they are "too sweet for
any thine." But best of all she has a pony.
I wish you could see her pretty saddle

Dear little face, so winsome and fair,
Framed in a halo of golden hair;
Eyes thoughtful, serious, sparkling, gay,
Like a wind-swept rill on a summer day.
Mouth like a rosebud cleft in twain,
Breathing its perfume after the Fain ;
Teeth like the gleam of a drop of dew
In the rosebud's heart as it opes to view â
Half hidden, as though too much revealed
Would mar the beauty therein concealed ;
A laugh like the music of fairy bells,
Ringing at midnight in dewy dells ;
A presence that breathes of light and love,
Bearing our thoughts to the realms above,
For surely the angels are not more fair
Than this dear little child with golden hair.

Dear EdUrett: The Diece about the "doodle
bug" fey "The Schoolma'am" was very inter
esting. I think from what shn wrote that it is
what we call the nntealer found here. They
have holes shnued like an lnvertel cone. I
have scon them catch ants very quickly.
The ants, after they are once in the
traps, seldom get out again. The shower of
earth thrown up by them is very pretty. Last
year I found a lot of these doodle-bugs' nests,
and I tmk a few and put them tn a oan with
dry, light earth into which they would bur-
row. After their holes had been made, I
gave them ants and other insects for food.
Adeline Knapp's article in this last Call
was very interesting. The martens are build
ing i. cits and they are making a lot of fuss
over it. In the early morning you can hear
them scream arid chirp We have a marten
house over our home. Every spring they
come here and build nests and hatch young
martens. They are very happy when they are
teaching their little ones to fly. I saw a marten
coax a young one once to a building a good
ways eff from home. After it got there it took
the parents some time to get it back.
The fruit trees are in full blossom here now.

STAGE
People sufferine from the blues who
want to shake off the worries and anxie
ties of this wicked world for a few brief j
hours could scarcely find a Detter kill-care
than "El Capitan." The operetta, as De
Wolf" Hopper presents it, could be war
ranted to make even a confirmed hypo
chondriac laugh aloud, and as for the peo
ple who fire neither blue nor hypochon
driacal, ii Keeps them in a state of almost
continual mirth. There is nothine to tax
the mind or the imagination in "El Capi
tan." The plot pursues its jovial, irre
sponsible, rollicking way without a serious
moment, and Sous a has been true to
the light, frothy libretto all throueh
*the score, and has carefuily avoided those
erratic incursions into grand opera, that
have made crazy patchwork of De Koven's
later works. Sometimes "El Capitan"
swings along to a march that makes one
think of picnics, Fourths of July, and all
sorts of festive occasions, when masses of
people tramp alone together in good fel
lowship; sometimes Sousa's muse be
comes a triÂ£e sentimental, bat there is
not a bar of the music that could not be
appreciated by a popular gallery audi
ence, and that is as it should be, for
operetta is for the masses, as much as for
the classes.
It would be idle to pretend that the
score of "El Capitan" is epoch-making
music that will be sung when we are all
under the sod â as "Shamus O'Brien" will
probably be â but if "El Capitan's" life
will not be long, it is a merry one, and
Jonn Philio fcousa, who has added so
much to the gayety of nations â especially
to this nation â has done us another good
turn by writing an opera that is consist
ent, bright, and contains numerous tunes
warranted pleasant and easy to sng and
whistle on a first hearing.
Kleine's book is really clever and his
idea of a man heading an insurrection
against himself for purposes of personal
safety is distinctly novf l. "if the rebels
win I am solid with them and if they lose
I can behead them all" is the viceroy's
reasoning as he decides to participate in
the rebellion against himself. Peru, in
the sixteenth century, is the land where
this original Governor is supposed to have
held sway and De Wolf Hopper's magni
ficent staging shows how rich American
subjects are in brilliant and novel scenic
effects. Most of us are tired of the
eternal peasants, uniformed officials and
soldiers of French and Viennese
operettas, who continually appear in
a background of old European mar
ket-places, or of halls, supposedly
marble, where noblemen of high degree
dwell. The European operettas are all
very picturesque in their way, but va
riety is the spice of operetta, as well as of
life, and the novelty of "El Capitan's"
scenic effects is an acceptable seasoning
no gendarmes, no peasants are here, but
picturesque mountaineers, half shepherd,
half brigand, mingle with gorgeous six
teenth century hangers-on of the vice
regal court and Spanish soldiers in glit
tering uniforms. And how beautiful the
scenery is, particularly in the second act,
where, from the ci:y gates, we look up
into the fastnesses of the Andes and see
Aztec ruins, mingling with the Spanish
fortifications that span the deep gorge.
The scene is a perfect color symphony in
green, terra cotta and delicate pale olue.
At if to be in keeping with his artistic
scenery De "W olf Hopper has surrounded
himself with exceptionally handsome
people. Barring one or two exceptions he
seems to hare selected them for their good
looks, though most of them can act fairly
well and sing fairly well in addition to
pleasing the eye. No one has a chance to
set the bay on fire, except De Wolf Hop
per as the Viceroy, alias Er Capitan, for
most of the oleaginous matter in the book
is his, and nearly all the laurels of the
performance rest upon his massive brow.
There is not too much Hopper, however.
On the contrary, he plays the part of the
telfrb, absurd viceroy bo ridiculously and
humanly withal that his role might be j
double as long as it is without palling on j
the spectators.
It has seemed lately as if when society
ladies go upon the stage their fancy
lightly turns to thoughts of tights. In
Paris the Princess de Chimay chose that
style of costume as the most appropriate
for her debut, and not to be behind la
ville Lumiere S&n Francisco has hadâ and
still hasâ a society lady, Mrs. Dimond, j
appearing in the same light and airy
costume. Paris went crazy over the
Princess, but, practically speaking,
the San Francisco public has be
stowed upon Mrs. Dimond's "nude
pnrture" those bits of anatomy face
tiously known as "the glassy eye,"
"the clammy hand" and "the marble
heart." She has had a mild "aucceu de
curiosity," it is true, but there has been
no finnting to secure seats, no dragging
the prices up to the top notch, no excite
ment or hysteria whatever. This may be
due to the innate delicacy of San Fran
cisco or it may be personal indifference to
Mrs. Dimond. Perhap*<hings would have
been different had she been tho beautilul
Princess de Chiraay, wnose debut was so
neatly nipped in the bud by the Parisian
police. I cannot resist quoting an ac
count of the affair written by a Paris cor
respondent:
Twenty-iranc boxes were cheat) at 500 franc*.
The ordinary peat was quoted at 20 francs, and
the price, simply for the promenade, had gone
up to 5 francs. All this to see the Princess
Chimay in three "nudepariures." Bhe was to
touch a very big salary, I know, but the man
agement would have lost nothing if they could
only have been certain of that first night's
takings. Sandwichmen lined the streets an
nouncing the appearance of Clara, and her
name glared at you from every advertisement
pillar on the boulevards. It was to be the
event of the season, and big theaters changed
the date of their premieres so as not to clash.
But in France there is a man with almost un â 
limited authority and tremendous suavity,
and that is the Frefet de la Police. M. Lepine.
He called the Princess to his office and he also
summoned M. Marchaud, her manager,
thoughtlessly overlooking Riga. He seems to
have acted with considerable grace.
He appealed to the better nature of the
woman. He pointed ou; that the mother of
tu-o or three children could hardly claim the
permission of the police in the name of Art to
appear as Venus. He also pointed out that
such a performance could only bring pain on
the family whose name she had borne. Clara
replied iv a thoroughly American fashion, "1
have the right to appear, and appear I will."
Then M. Lepine spoke out. "If you dare to ap
pear to-morrow eight I will tell you what will
happen. One club alone of which your hus
band is a member has bought 100 live rabbits,
and they will be thrown on the stage. What
will be thrown from other quarters I don't
know. This much I tell you; if there is a riot
in tne hail to-morrow night, I will close it. If
you are the cause of that riot I shall withdraw
your 'permission de sejour' and out you go."
Half an hour Inter the Princess had a doctor's
certificate to say that she was suffering from
the influenza.
Mrs. Dimond's debut did not threaten
to be so sensational as that and San Fran
cisco has no urbane Chief of Police, "with
almost unlimited authority," to interpose
persuasive arguments and talk about
bringing pain on the family, and Mrs. Di
mond has appeared as an Amazon, un
checked and unremonstrated with. I
assed her the other day why she has seen
fit to practice so much economy in the
matter of ciothes for her debut, and she
answered frankly that there was no econ- j
omy about it. "Thoae costumes I wore
cost mo $25 for a week's hire, but it was j
an exorbitant price and I have changed
my costumer. I wore tights because there
was more money in them than in skirts,
and Ism out for money; it's a matter of
bread and butter with me."
"Ana you did riot feel a trifleâwell
nervous?" I asked.
"Of course I was nervous," she replied,
"but I thought of the money in it and be
came as cold as ice. Oh, I'm ambitious,
very ambitious, ihougti you might not
thint it, but I'm out for money."
TITE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
"And society â " I insinuated.
"1 don't care a snap for society. li's a
hollow fraud. Whnt does it matter to me
what society thinks? Society won't cive
rae bread and butter, now that I am no
longer rich. I have an angel, the one
from Montana, who believes in my talent,
and is willing at any timo to put me at
the head of a company. I am as inde
pendent, though, as I am ambitious, and
will accept nothing till lam ready to ap
pear under his management in the East
ern houses. Meanwhile the chance to ap
pear here offered me moneyâ money and
bread and butterâ and that is what I am
out for."
Many very extraordinary things ear
done daily in the name of bread and but
ter, and Mrs. Dimond's "nude departure"
is certainly not the least extraordinary.

To-morrow sees the beginning of the
second and last week of De "Wolf Hopper
and "El Capitan." The opera has been
excellently received, aim the most t>romi
nent solos and choruses are encored every
night. As Don Meduiga, the weakling,
suddenly resolving that he may save him
self by personating the fierce El Capitan,
Hopper finds just tho-e conditions in
which hit propensity for grotesque fun
can have fullest play.

New York furnishes the scenes and in
cidents for "The Wnite Rat," whicn is to
receive its first Western production at
Morosco's Grand Opera-house to-morrow
nignt. The story is full of excitement,
turning on the killing of a sailor who car
ries a small fortune In diamonds con
cealed in the body of a stuffed white rat.
A noble young fellow is accused of the
crime, and the efforts of his friends
to prove his innocence carry the
action of the play through dance
halls, opium joints, the river docks and
picturesque slums and allow of the intro
duction of some funny comedy scenes.
The stock company has been re-enforced
by a number of specially engaged people,
among whom are Johnson and Harvey, a
Chinese musical team and Baby Lewis.
Mollie Thompson and Nat M. Wills are to
have some funny songs.
TiVoli Opera-House.
The Tivoli Opera-house has found in
"Shamus O'Brien" a magnet to attract
many times the lovers of good music and
care.'ul operatic production. The opera
will be continued this week, when Denis
O'Sullivan will Introduce each evening
two Irish ballads. It was as a singer of
Irish ballads that he made nis great sue-
[ cess throughout Great Britain and Ire
iund, and was seen hy Jessop and Stan
ford, tti" author and composer of
"Shamus O'Brien," who singled him out
as their man for the interpretation of the
role of Shamus.
After the run of "Shamtis O'Brien" a
German comic ODera, Dellinger's waltz
and march opera, "Captain Fracaasa"
(The Prince of Liars), will be presented
with new scenery and costumes and a
! cast including ail the membors of the

of color. This latter amusement is new
to San Francisco.

"Jhc First Born."
A cold and icy barrier has always ex
isted between Chinese dramatic art and
the American stage. American actors
have been wont to look upon their pig
tailed fellow Thespians as freaks, and
every self-respecting Chinese actor would
be shorn of his cue rather than own there
was anything he could learn of the Ameri
can stage.
Daring the last few weeks, howaver,
this icy barrier has been gradually yield
ing to the genial efforts of the Alcazar
company to produce a Chinese play
written by Francis Powers. Tne entente
cordiale between the Alcazar and the
Chinese theater has ac present progressed
so far tbat Manager Belasco is consider
ing an offer to give a Sunday matinee with
his company at the Chinese theater, and
the Chinese actors have not only placed
their entire wardrobe at the disposal of the
Alcazar company, but, have also sent some
of their most accomplished lyric and in
strumental artists to rehearse at the
Alcazar for to-morrow night's production
of "The First Born" ('Choni; Chee").
This blissful state of brotherhood in art
between white and yellow aciors did not
come about without a struggle. Members
of the consulate and a few ricn merchants
were the first to embrace the icea of an
American play written on a Chinese sub
ject. Many of them have since r>la(ed
their learning and their clothesâ in some
cases even their wives' clothes â at the dis
posal of Bela?co'3 comedians. Hip Long,
the well-known merchant, was the pioneer
In the entente cordiale.
Francis Powers says he shudders when
he thinfcs of the anachronisms and blun
ders which his learned Chinese friends
have rescued him from with timely ad
vice. Only a few days ago he selected a
magnificent mandarin costume for him
self from the wardrobe of the Chinese
theater and put it on at the Consulate
that one of the secretaries, who has been
playing Mentor to his Telemaque all
along, might admire it. To his surprise
the secretary burst out laughing, and
when Francis Powers ruefully inquired
the reason he said: ''Excuse this smile,
but you are wearing the dress of a man
darin's wife."
The lower classes of the Chinese have
shown anything but the friendliness ex
hibited by iheir educated compatriots.
Two scenic artists, J. Hopfenwitz and E. !
Duran, who went out to make sketches in
Bartlett alley last week, were mobbed by
an angry crowd of coolies, their sketch
books were snatched from their hands and
torn to pieces before their eyes, and the
disconsolate artists left the alley in a bat
tered and dilapidated condition, vowing
they'd never go there any more.
Two camera fiends were bribed to steal
into the alley next morning early ana
take snap shots before many Chinese were
up, and from these snap shots the scenery
for "Chong Chee" has been painted.

ah the good offers made her and when she
leaves the Sporting Duchess Company she will
open in Pittsburg with a stock company and
play her old plays for the summer.
The Lyceum Theater Â» ompany's production
of "The Mayflower" is meeting with good suc
ceison the road. The play has been greatly
polished up since Us Initial New York produc

fairly captured New Yorkers by her charming
personality and stage work.
Clara Morrii U actively preparing for her
debut on the vaudeville stage, where she will

dramatic to anticipate posters announcing
Miss Morris at a vaudeville theater, sand
wiched between a song-and-dance team at ten
minutes past 9 p. x. and a music-hall soubrette
at ten minutes to 10. But if the salary offered

While our Eastern friends are nailing
the advent of spring we dwellers by the
Golden Gate are really in the full tide of
summer, albeit May is scarcely upon us.
The bloom is on the grass, the grain is in
the straw, and the evening air is vibratile
with the piping of the little trwetoad, a
characteristic summer sound. A surer in
dication yet that summer is with us are
the innumerable ant-heaps I find in the
footpaths as Igo about the hills. To me
there is no more interesting creature in
nature tnan this little black insect we see
continually going to and fro upon the
earth.
One may well "consider her ways and
be wise," but tne wisdom will consist
largely in the avoidance of imitating
them. There is something marvelous
Bbout the industry of tbese creature*.
They are all but tireless, their ingenuity
is almost incredible, and the best of it is
thnt not one of them toils for self, but
each works for ail the others, and the en
ergy of all is concentrated upon the safety
and well-being of the young of the race.
For these are laid out and builded the
wonderful subterranean cities; for these
are the labyrinthian storehouses, the
hoards of grain and wealth of cattle, and
for these a laree number of their elders
are toiled oS as especial nurses and care
takers.
The ants know a pood many things that
human beings would like to find out.
They are expert architects, engineers and
builders. They know how to store grain
under ground, and yet keep it from grow
ing, while we can not even keep potatoes and
onions from sprouting in our vesetable |
bins, or our wheat from rotting and j
ANCIENT AND MODERN ATHENS COMPARED.
Greece is a subject of perennial interest,
and just now while the world is watching
her plucky but useless struggle against
her one-time master it is with a strong
revival of concern in her past and future
that one plances again through the pages
of her history. It was recorded of the he
roic struggle in the twenties of this cen
tury, when the Greeks rose in insurrec
tion against the Ottomans, that the people '
of Europe could not disconnect in their
minds the Hellpnes of that date from the
forever famous race who had taken such a
high place in the lifting of man from bar
barism, and in spite of the Jong lapse of
centuries and the iarge admixture of alien
blood in the people that then fought
for liberty on Grecian soil the civil
ized world persisted in seeing in the
modern Greeks "tbe
counterparts of those
glorious beings who
gave to Europe their
ideals of intellectual
energy, of plastic
beauty, and of poetic
truth." The same
feeling is alive to
day, and is immortal.
The name Greek is
inseparably joined in
men's minds with the
thought of greatness
in letters, art and
heroism, and the
world will continue
to observe with sym
pathetic interest
what sort of effect
the forces of heredi
ty, atavism and tne
stimulus of glorious
traditions will have
in the progressive ev
olution of that race
which has inherited
the land and the lan
guage of the ancient
Hellenes.
Among a few of the
most interesting
things in the records
of modern Greece is
the judgment ot Leo
pold, the first King
of the liberated country, upon tne su
preme importance of the possession of the
island of Crete to the hopes of the
Hellenes for a safe and progressive na
tional existence. Because the powers re
fused to add Crete and Thessaly to the
kingdom Leopold resigned the Grecian
crown as an empty honor. It is worth
noting that Leopold's wise and successful
reign over the Belgians, who subsequently
called him to be their sovereign, drew
from Giadstone the eulogium that he was
the greatest of the state-man tings of his
age, and probably of his century.
Among the multitude of interesting
facts concerning the Greek fight for Hd
erty from 1821 to 1828 two may be singled
ont ac specially worthy of remembrance:

swelling in the holds of oar ships. What
do they do to it, these tiny black magi
cians, that the grain will lie in their
earthy granaries and keop sweet and
wholesome? Destroy the ants in one of
the little pathway Tillages, and in a short
time this grain â will sprout and grow, but
while they are aiive and in charge of it
they can keep it from doing this, and our
vaunted human reason cannot tell us
how. The little red ants make war upon
the big black ones, carry them off into
captivity and compel them to do all their
work. Red and black alike capture the
little green aphides that infest our rose
bushes and keep them underground as
cattle, for the sake of the sweet drops of
moisture secreted by these insects. They
take excellent csre of them and "milk"
them daily. They are wise, too, in the
accumulation of wealth, and in guarding
it from depredation, but, when all's said
and done, their industry is a terrible sort
of thing that would be deadly to the
human race. The desira of much gain
has made them blind.
Originally winged, seeing creatures,
they crawled upon the earth, using their
wings so little that gradually they lost
these organs. Only a few retain them,
the true females and the males, and these
only for a brief season, in the mat
ing time, when they essay a short
nuptial flight, and after that the
males die, the females lose their wings
and retire to ttie underground cities for
the balance of their lives. It is probable
that the<e winged ants retain some power
of sight, but the workers are blind. They
used their eyes to no better purpose than
they did their wines, and in time tney
solve among the Hellenes to be free; and
the revival of the original form of the
pure Greek tongue and return to the en
joyment of its literature was very largely
the inspiration of the courage and per
sistence that after seven years of endeavor
threw off the Ottoman yoke.
The position of the great powers to
Greece during that memorable struggle
was very similar to their attitude now;
and inasmuch as history often repeats it
sett, the remarkable change the policy of
the great Governments then passed
through in deference to the philhellenism
of the maÂ«se9 of the European people
may promise another sweeping change to
Greek advantage. Potmlar sympathy
may in the present emergency again
j change the plans of the Governments.
The Acropolis of Ancient Athens.
History gives evidence that it has often
been the fate of Europe in regard to the
Eastern question to make mistakes whicli
it was compelled to acknowledge by
subsequent acts. At the first out
break of the Greek insurrection in
1821 the European Governments looked
coldly npon it as a dangerous eruption
against lawful sovereignty. Europe was
then dominated by the principles of the
Holy Alliance, which, in spite of the fine
name, was strongly antagonistic to hu
man liberty. The sentiment of the people
gradually counteracted this until the great
Austrian, statesman, Metternicb, took the
lead in favoring Greek freedom, declaring
that "very soon there would be no Greeks
left to liberate," and all the great powers
combined to give national life to Hellas.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1897.
lost them. You can prove their Bight less
ness at any time by drawing with the
point of a lead pencil, or with a little
stick, a shallow trench across the trail of
a line of ants as they journey to and from
their nnst. The trench mar be but a faint
depressed line, bat the ants will wander
helplessly along it until one happens to
get across and strikes the traii on the
other side. Then, one after another, all
will find the new route and travel in it
though it may lose them yards out of the
direct line. Sometimes they do not find
the way at all, but wander about aimless
and abject, until they disperse to perish
within a few inches of home.
I watched an ant not long ago as it
toilea along bearing a little stick twice its
own length. It tugged and pushed, trav
eling now forward, now backward, pro
gressing slowly to the entrance of the ant
heap. Presently a fellow-worker happened
along and stumbling against the free end
of the little stick seized hold upon it, as I
I supposed , to help. Bat the game of cross
| purposes that followed was as Interesting
as it was senseless. The two creatures
pulled in opposite directions, rolling over,
whirling round, backing and going for
ward, but getting further and further
from home. At last one of them lost its
hold and feeling along the stick probably
to obtain a better grasp upon it came sud
denly in contact with the other toiler.
There was a great rubbing together of
antennse, a mutual recognition, appar
sntly, and then one went off and left the
other to bear the burden alone. It seemed
quite evident that each had until then
been unaware of the other's presence and
labors. Before the stick was at last safe
within the entrance this little comedy was
repeated and nearly a minute after it dis
appeared it was thrown suddenly and vio
lently out, only to do dragged in again a
little later.
The orioles came last week and the trees

The fact that the present King George
is not merely sovereign of Greece, but is
in an especial sense King of the Hellenes,
is important in connection with the sta
tistics which sho A-that the Hellenes num
ber over 8,000,000, while the population of
Greece is not much more than 2,000,000.
When King George was elected every
community of Greeks that could muster a
hundred, no matter in what distant land,
had a voice in the ctioosing. The value
of these scattered subjects is illustrated
by the large share they took in the re
building of the fairest portion cf modern
Athens; and the idea suggested by tuch
a claim of wide sovereignty may yet de
velop into a great aid to the restoration of
a great Greek nationality.
There is a truth in the history of modern
Greece which, wnile it will be unwelcome
to many, must be recollected in order that
we nay be just to the Turt. The Ottoman
was not wholly without excuse for his
atrocities, and the fenrlul vengeance he
took while he had the upper hand of the
Greeks had its equally cruel provocation.
When the rebels rose in the Morea their
plan was to exterminate the Turks with
out regard to sex or age, and in so far as
they were able they proceeded to execute
their design with ruthless brutality. At
the capture of Navarino, although the
Moslems had been solemnly promised by
the terms of capitulation a safeguard out
of the city, they were treacherously butch
eredâmen, women and children. Equally
sanguinary waa the taking of Tnpolitza
and there the Greek commander, Koloko
trones, rode from the
gate to the citadel
without the hoofs of
his horse ever touch
ing anything but the
faces and bodies of
the victims. Such
things should be
duly considered
while we vituperate
the Turk for his cruel
conquest of the Isle
of Scio.
It is noteworthy
that the Greeks in
many sections, par
ticularly in the Mge
an Island*, enjoyed a
higher degree of lib
erty while under the
Turks than was the
lot of any other peo
ple in Europe at that
time except the
Swiss.
It is recorded as a
sober truth of history
that Lord Byron, by
his eloquence, had a
large share in the lib
eration of Greece.

These ara usually the last of our migratory
birds to arrive. They belong to summer
and the season of ripening seeds. It was a
warm, beantiful morning when they made
their appearance and awoke m? in the
dewy uours with their clear melody. The
bl da, in migrating, travel at night, and
in this season of the year the bird lover
who goes afiold at 5 o'clock in the morn
ing is pretty certain to be greeted by some
newcomer. Sometimes the visitors tarry
but a day. I saw two birds one morning
last week that I am pretty certain were
Blackburnian warblers, but they were
doubtless on their way to some other sum
mer residence, for they tarried with me
but a day. The bluebirds have not here
tofore, to my knowledge, nested in this
locality, but a flock stopped over for a day
a fortnight ago, and, taking a fancy to my
bird boxes, seem to have settled down for
the summer. In doing this tbey had an
encounter with the English sparrows and
completely rooted these aggressive little
intruders. The English sparrow, in rural
scenes, is by no means the unpleasant,
quarrelsome creature he is in the city.
Urban associations have a deteriorating
effect upon him. Even his voice grows
harsher and more querulous.
I saw a female bluebird investigating a
sparrow's nest the other day, whether
with predatory intent I could not deter
mine. The entrance to the nest was
through a small crack in the sheathing of
the house near the eaves. I knew that
mother sparrow was on the nest, for I
had seen her go in but a minute before,
and the head of that sparrow household
sat upon the eave trough and watched the
visitor, but made do move in her direc
tion. The bluebird clung to the edge of
the opening and peered curiously down
into the nest, but the sparrow hen made
no sign either of welcome or repulsion.
After a moment's inspection the visitor
flew away, but returned again and again,
sometimes perching, sometimes hovering
with rapidly vibrating wings opposite the
opening, which seemed to have a strange
fascination for her. Her mute sat upon
the ridgepole of the house watching her
over his shoulder, after the manner of
these birds, and it was perhaps his pres
ence that kept the cock-sparrow quies
cent, but the performance was a curious
one.
A single pair of snowbirds have lingered
this summer and are evidently building
hereabouts, though all their whilom com
panions have departed to the mountains,
whither these bt|ds usually repair in nest
ing time. The male bird has found his
voice and sitting upon a iow twig delivers
himself from time to time of a low, twit
tering trill that, judging from her rapt
tures nre not developed in anything like
proportion to the advancement of the age,
yet her progress since she was relieved of
the Ottoman yoke has been in many ways
very creditable. The Turk left that
country sixtv-peven years ago a smoK
ing, blood-soaked ruin. Since then
she has increased .her revenue five
hundred fold, the acreage in currants
and vineyards ia a hundred times as
broad, 2000 miles of fine roads have been
built at a cost of ten millions, big'engi
neering enterprises in the way of canal
cutting for commerce and for draining
wide areas to leave the alluvial soil cap
able of cultivation have been carried
through, eleven new cities have been
founded on sites formerly deserted, forty
towns rained by the war have been re
built and present the aspect of prosperous
cities, ten ports have been cleared and
deepened, most prominent among them
being the Piraeus, and the maritime power
has expanded from 430 vessels to more
than 5000.
In 1836 a Bcotch college representative
sent home a report that the least mined
part of Athens were the old ruins them
selves. Now it is a progressive city of 114,000
population and is largely rebuilt in a style
of architecture beautiful and classic, many
of the finer structures being of white
marble. The wealthy Greeks scattered in
many lands contributed to this restora
tion. There is a romantic story connected
with the creation of the new library, which
is an architect's dream of beauty solidified
in white marble. Vallianos, an opulent
merchant, gave it to Greece oecause
Queen Olga had shielded his brother from
the fate usually accorded to detected
Russian anarchists.
Patras, next in size to Athens, is the
principal seaport It was completely de
stroyed by the Turks, but is now rebuilt
of white marble and has 50,000 people.
Illiteracy, which was almost universal
among the Hellenes wbilo under Turkish
rule, is now aimost unhndable in the lit
tle kingdom. Education is compuisorv,
fourteen years' schooling is provided, and
the curriculum reaches from the alphabet
to the university.
Since 1888 the interior of Greece has
been as safe from brigands as England.
The revived nation is very jealously
guarding its art treasures and it is against
the laws for a genuine antiquity to be sold
out of the country â the penalty being five
years' imprisonment and a heavy fine.
Athens runs more daily papers than the
city of New York, and the Greek used is
nearly the same as that of Zenopuon and
the New Testament.
The Greek has maintained his language,
his ground and his blood to the present
dayâ thirty centuries in the same spot.
Cecrops ruled in Athens when Moses was
writing the decalogue on Mount Sinai,
and the same form of speech was used as
that of the state papers of the Hellas of
to-day.
The debt of Greece is $75 per bead of the
population and equals 14 per cent of the
entire wealth of the country. So wisely
has the borrowed money been used the in
curring of it is considered a good invest
ment. There is a strict economy in all
branches of the administration. The mem
bers of the Boule are paid but a trifle, and
the highest salary of a general or an ad
miral does not exceed $1200.
Only one-third of the Greeks live in
Greece. In European Turkey they out
number the Turks nearly three to one. In
Asia Minor they are one-fourth of the
Turks. All told the Greek race is to the
Turks in the proportion of 6to 7%. The
Ottoman empire numbers 34,500,000, but
there are less than 10,000 Omanus. To
whatever we may attribute their power of
domination, it is certainly not due to
overwhelming numbers.
The population of Greece has trebled
since freedom and is now 2,187,000.
The regular army of Greece is 28,000,
the reserve 104,000 and the Landwehr adds
146.000 more. The navy has five armored
vessels, seventeen torpedo-boats and two
submarine torpedo-boats.
The Greeks of to-day are considered by
ethnologists as nn t only lineal descend
ants of the famous Hellenes of old, but in
spite of many admixtures to be as like
as any race in Europe to their ancestors.
In the rapid progress of the human race,
confidently expected in the coming twen
tieth century, it may be that the force of
atavism will bring again to the fore the
descendants of that people of ancient
Hellas who by their philosophy, litera
ture and art have so profoundly affected
I modern thought.

I met one of my neighbors the other day
hurrying 'cross lots in great distress. One
of his calves iiad lost its cud and he was
seeking the local wiseacre to learn what to
do. Later I caw him returning with the
air of one who has found that which be
sought. The wiseacre had told him to
take a piece of salt pork, wrapped in
the leaves of the dogfennel, and put it
into the animal's throat. He did this and
afterward told me that the "false cad"
worked like a charm. It would be inter
esting could one trace the origin of this
myth of the cow's cud. Farmer folk will
tell you in all seriousness that if a cow
loses her cud the loss must be made good
within twenty-four hours or the animal
will die.
According to them this mysterious ob
j'Ct, when not in use, reposes in the first
stoniacn of the cow. One positive owner
of cattle assures me that the cow has two
cuds, and chews them alternately, and
scarcely one but is ready with the most
astonishing instances of bovine fatality

AN ENTOMOLOGICAL DISCOVERY.
W. Saville-Kent of London, one of the
most famous of naturalists, has just made
public the news of a remarkable discovery
by him in Australia â the work of ants,
huge in size and almost human in intellect
The news thus made public is of the great
est interest to the scientific world and
seems to tirmi y establish what has hitherto
been held as a chimerical theory, that the
ant rivaled the monkey in point of in
telligence.
The Australian ants, which Mr. Savllle-
Kent has found and studied, are of the
class known as the termites, or white
ants. They are capable of destroying al
most anything they attack, and a human
being is by no means safe from assaults
by them. Their homes are in the shape
of mammoth slabs of sandstone, which
they resemble to a considerable degree.
A carious fact that Mr. Saville-
Kent pro Ted is that in every in
stance the homes of these termites
were built from north to south and
close observation showed this principle
of construction was apparent in all their
work. It was demonstrated to Mr. Sa
ville-Kent' s satisfaction that the creatures
seemed to govern their actions by the
points of the compass, and their work
showed conclusively that they moved and
lived according to a definite plan. So
complete in detail was this plan it con
vinced the traveler that it was the result
of what at least approached thought.
The white ants are found generally
throughout North Queensland, quite a
distance inland from Port Darwin, in the
Laura Valley. This is an extensive sec
tion of Northern Queensland and in it
these ants seem to dwell, divided into
tribes and sub-nationalities, being sub
jected, apparently, to a general form of
government or vassalage. There seemed
to be a central town or community
to which at various times ants
made pilgrimages from the surrounding
country, although the discoverer found
that they had homes of their own else
where. The style of house built by these
ants varied to a considerable extent. The
majority were like the slabs of sandstone
already described, while others were like
haycocks. A singular form of construc
tion which these ants followed to quite a
little extent was that of the pyramid. Mr.
Saville-Kent was, in a number of in
stances, so fortunate as to find abandoned
anthouses of various kinds, and thus he
was enabled to observe the inner methods
of construction thereof.
One mound In particular, a groined
columnar structure, was eighteen feet
high. This was not far from Port Dar
win. The accompanying illustration,
which is drawn from a photograph, is,
Saville-Kent tells us, of complete accur
acy. It will be noticed that the point ol
ingress and egress is about a foot and a
half from the top. The discoverer be
lieves that originally the mound was coni
cal in shape, the sides being smooth.
It had evidently been in use for
many years and the columnar effect
noticeable, he believes, is due to the fact
that the ants incessantly traveling the
pathways up and down the mound pro
duced the grooves that are seen, and re
sulted in giving t be effect of a columnar

and in its time has been on the scene of
some of the most exciting incidents in the
history of the State.
This interesting carriage was made in
England and brought to Monterey in 1836.
Since that time it has seen almost con
stant service, being retired only a short
time before the General's death. It has
been from end to end of California many
times and except for its battered appear
ance seems to be still good enough for a
Ereat deal of hard service. This is all the
more remarkable in the face of the fact
that the roads it was dragged over in the
old days were about as bad as could be
found on top of the earth. No roads at
all, one might say.
The prime reason for the purchase of
this vehicle was the Mexican Govern
ment's extension of its military outposts.
Monterey being the headquarters in 1835,
the Presidio of Sonoma was looked upon
as out of the world. And it was a big
journey between the two points in those
days, even with the best of vehicles. What
must it have been in some of the crude
traveling contrivances manufactured on
the coast at the time?
pendage. And still, in the face of all this,
the b&re scientific fact is that the cow has
no cud, in any such sense. The animal
has no upper front teeth. She reaps the
green forage with her lone, rougb tongue,
gathering it in in great, juicy mouthiuls,
which she swallows without chewing, re
serving that process for leisure moments,
when, standing in the shade or lying at
ease upon the grass, she devotes herself to
meditative mastication. Now we say she
is "chewing the cud*'' Literally, she is
chewing the contents of the first stomach,
and the food, once thoroughly masticated,
passes into the second stomach and .is
assimilated. I've often been moved to
mild wonder as to what becomes of the
lumps of salt-pork and other weird bo
luses that well-meaning people thrust into
the bovine throat in lieu of the cud which
they believe to be lost. Probably more
dyspeptic cows have been killed by the
"failure" of this remedy than have been
cured by its successful operation. Yet, so
deep-seated is the notion that we find
even John Burroughs affirming it in sober
credulity.
It belongs with the popular bel'efs tbat
formation. The entrance to the mound, i
examination showed, hsd varied in loca
tion, for there was distinct evidence tha<
apertures of this sort had been walled up
in several instances.
The interior of the mound referred to
showed as much as anything the remark
able instinct of the ant 3. It was divided
up very much after the fashion of the tall
buildings which are now becoming so
common, with an immense court within the
structure itself. That is, there were hun
dreds of tiny cells built in from galleries
which were terraced one above the other.
The galleries were connected by paths of
stairways, each of these being constructed
with architectural exactness. The cells
were almost uniform in size, and reminded
Knowing that he would bare to make
the journey several times each year, Gen
eral Vallejo ordered the carriage from
England, and snid It must be of the best
possible quality. When it reached Mon
terey it was the admiration of the county,
although it looked a little queer to the
people. When four horses were hitched to
it and galloped over the de.Â«ert with it it
must have been a sight worth looking at,
for the carriage is picturesque in the ex
treme and everybody knows how gayly
horses were decorated In those days.
With plenty of changes of horses the
trip from Sonoma to Monterey consumed
in good weather about four days and from
a week to ten days in rainy weather. The
road did not lie, as one would suppose, on
this side of the bay, but along the Oak
land shore. From Sonoma the catriage
was driven to Embarcadero, where a
sailing vessel transferred it across the bay
to Point San Pedro. Somefrnes thin took
only a few hoxfrs' and sometimes all day.
From Point San Pedro the road lay
along the Berkeley hills toward the Mis
sion San Jose and through where Niles
now stands. At this point General Val
lejo's brother Had built a flourmill, said to
be the first in the State. From Niles the
road passed through the Santa Clara and
Pajaro valleys, reaching Monterey by
passing the Mission Â£21 Carmelo. On these

dence of lone-continued usage. A portion
of the ground floor or basement of the
mound had been divided up into store
rooms, and here it was evident the ants
had carefully packed away the provender

points about.

intelligence of insects and animals have

trips the general always had a party with
him, and the horses were kept on the gal
lon all the way. When conditions were
j favorable and the horses in good condi
tion as much as sixty-five miles has been
covered in a day.
As well as these journeys to Monterey
j tne old carriage has borne the general on
I business of state to all parts of California,
| as far south asEnsanada and to the north
j ward as far as the line of advancing civili-
I zation extended. Hundreds of miles had
I been traveled over country where there
| were no roads, and the horsei pulled and
dragged through miles of sand and desert
vegetation.
The saddest moment in the history of
the carriage must have been the time
when General Valtejo was not permitted
to ride in it. Mrs. Haraszthy, General
Vallejo's daughter, will remember the
time. It was, she says, when the Bear
flap raisers made their descent on the town
in 1846, and captured her father. He was
sick in bed at the time, but waa made to
ride horseback by the invaders, who took
him away from his family, in spite of the
fact that he said he was unable to do so,
ana asked to be allowed to ride in his own
carriage, which was quickly harnessed and
kept in waiting as soon as it was known
that be was going.
Aftei the exciting times of the cola
fever the carriage was used as a convey
ance for business and family until the
railroad came through Sonoma. After
that it was used by the general for trips
about the country until shortly before hia
death, when it was hauled into this dark
room in the old adobe stable, where It
has remained ever since, gradually accu
mulating a covering of cobwebs.
Although it is called a carriage General
Vallejo's old vehicle really looks more
like a buggy. But that is as far as the re
semblance goes. The running gear is of
the heaviest description, and is the same
to-day as when it first came to this country.
There is room for three people to sit on
the seat, and a large amount of luggage
can be carried in front and on straps in
the rear. The springs are of the easiest
known styleâ part steel and part straps.
In appearance the vehicle is of the quaint
est description. The high dashboard in
front c ready adds to this, although at first
glance it looks most ungainly.
Mrs. Emparan, General Vallejo's daugh
ter, who owns the vehicle, has signified her
willingness to donate the historic carriage
to any California historical society that
will promise to properly care for and pre
serve it. This, of course, should be done,
as the old conveyance is sure to be of the
greatest interest to coming generations.DEAF MUTES TAKE PART IN A LIVELY DEBATE.
The Y. M. O. A. parlors were filled with gayly dressed ladies and well-mannered \
men. They sat easily by one another and laughed and nodded, but they gave forth |
no sound.
It was a meeting of deaf-mutes!
The institution at Berkeley ana the deaf-mute branch of the Y. M. C. A. have had
a series of three debates, and this was the occasion of the third and last.
From the back portion of the room I watched them as in animated conversation
ihey swayed back and lorward. There was a bewildering waving of arms, a graceful
twirling of rineers, and each motion so deftly and quickly accomplished that it was
almost impossible for an untrained eye to follow.
' Good-evening.' some one said, and it seemed strange to hear a voice again.
'"You have come to hear, or rather see, the debate? ' asked the young man as he
seated bimse.f and handed me his card. "This is expected to be doubly interesting
because each side ha^ won. Their question to-night ie, 'Is higher education neces
sary for the learning of a trade from a deaf-mute's standpoint.' The debaters from
Berkeley are T. Munch, Locecito and Hartman. Those from the Y. M. C. A. are Selig,
McCarty and Heckman. The Berkeley men have t&e negative."
''How strange it seems,." I murmured. The young man smiled.
"But they are happy," he said. "They have a world to themselves, with no
discord."
Just then, strangely enough, there came from a portion of the room a plaintive
moan like the last sob of a passionate outburst. I looked in the direction it came
from and saw a young girl, her bright face wreathed in smiles.
The gentleman explained:
"That is involuntary," he said. "They are not aware that they are making any
unusual sound â or any sound at all. It ccmes from their incorrect way of breathing.
"Those who are deaf-mutes from birth do not know how to breathe. In fact the
â¢majority of deaths among deaf-mutes are from pulmonary diseases."
And then the debate began, and the waving of hands and arms ceased and motion
was ended more completely than sound is from a usual audience. A tall young man,
a blonde with a pleasant manner, opened the debate, and was quickly followed by j
one from the opposite side; but neither of these held my attention as did the young
fellow of average height and swarthy complexion who followed.
It needed no voice at my side to tell me the land of his birth. The warmth, the
intensity, the beauty of his native land had left an impress in him â the fire and pas
sion of Italy flashed from his eyes and colored his lips and cheeks. "A peasant born
at the foot of said the gentleman at my side.' 1 He came here only seven
years ago and is now'the brightest student at Berkeley. Wait, I wiil translate some
of his argument."
I waited meanwhile, -watching the graceful fellow. What a face he had! "What
eyes! Surely could he have spoken his voioe would have rivaled in sweetness the
tinkling but passionless music of the mandolin; it would have equaled in depth the
soul-inspiring viol. \
There was humor in his speech. I could see it in his eyes and the turns cf his
head, and feel it from the motion of Jiis hands. And the others felt it, too, and it
seemed to sweep over them like a breath of warm air. "What is he saying?"
"'Education fills the. head,'" said my interpreter, watching the debater, "'but
not the stomach. Which is the better off, the Italian nobleman, with his head full
uf knowledge and Lis smooth white hands and no way to earn a living, or a Dago pea
aut-vendery "
Alas for romance 1 I fancied from that face that no common thought ever found
its way behind it. That humor, if it could be so called, would be humor half pathetic
and wholly poatical.
Bis arguments, too, might have been sounder and yet they pleased; they seemed
HOW A NOTED LITTLE ACTRESS ACTS AT HOME
1 have been lone prejudiced against j
child "stars" of all descriptions, since I .
have suffered much at their small hands; i
but it came about that I went one even
inz to a certain popular theater, and was
there figuratively taken captive, "horse,
foot and marine," by a little local
celebrity called Baby Lewis. Oi course
you ail know Baby Lewis. Wnen !
she first appeared I guzed at her critically j
and unsmilingly and smothered a yawn, j
. When she began to speak I became sul
--iÂ«nly interested, for she actually seemed
to understand and feel her line?, and the ,
sparkle. of her dark eyes and the poise
and swing of her lithe and graceful litiie j
rody to!d of a spirit that had never been
cowed into tamo submission by the will of
others. Bhe bad evidently been led and
not driven along the path which her
small feet were treading so cheerfully,
and the leading, because of the talent
within her, had been an easy task.
I.: was not, however, until I saw her |
dance that I became completely subju
gated. If it were not for the twinkling
feet executing with perfect ease and precis- j
ion some of the most difficult steps known
to our coast dancers, she would seem j
like nothing so mucfi as a bit of thistle- i
down blown about by the Breath of the ;
music to which her slender little figure I
sways and bends and turns as lightly and j
gracefully and responsively as does the !
delicate wtndflower of the New England ;
hills to tee summer breeze.
After that I saw my tiny charmer in
several parts and many specialties, and j
then I determined to see what kind of a .
child this winsome sprite of the magic j
land behind the footlights really is amid j
the prosaic surroundings of everyday life. ;
I found her playing with a group of j
children in her own yardâ tbe merriest j
and noisiest of them ail. They were i
"jumping French" and "double Dutch," j
she told me, and doing all the other as- ,
tonishing things that little girls do with j
â¢icippine-ropes, and "Baby" wai jumping
longer and higherand langbing and ahout
inc louder than any of them.
There was evidently nothing of tbe
"cotton ro-ebud" about her, for a more
"jinkin 1 , bonnie blinkin', bilty-Bkilty
lassie" 1 it was never my lot to meet.
The sunny curls were tumbled and the
Tarn o'Sbanter was awry when she came i
in to see me, but her cheeks were as pink
as mountain azaleas and hereyes shining
with the happy excitement of her play.
In two minutes we were excellent
friends and, curled up on the sofa beside j
me, she told roe of herself and her lift.
Does she like to appear in public? "Oh,
yes," and her face glow* with the earnest
ness of her affirmation, she "dearly loves"
to act and sing and play the banjo. For i
oile thing, people are all "so good" to her
and she has "such a nice time"; and for
another, "there is mamma and the i
reit, and we have no pepa," and it is aj '
' matter of childish pride to her to "earn j
j money and help along."
She has played three years now, she
tells me, ever since she v.-as 5 years old, i
and she has been in so many plays that j
she cannot remember them all.
"Sister teaches them to me," she says, ]
slipping a loving little hand into that of ,
I the gentle "big sister," whose special j
i charge she has been from babyhood.
i "She reads it all over to me and explains
it. and then I study it out by myself."
What kind of plays does she like best?
I Those "with lots of fan in them," most
! certainly; but still, of all the parts that
j she has played, that of the blind girl in
"Out in the Street" and that of Little
Lord Faumleroy please her best.
"Perhaps, though," she says, naively,
"that is because I made such hits in those
characters." JJC, t
And then she tells me of her late tri- |
I umphal tour with a stock company and
j of the flowers and candy and more sub- j
stantial presents that fell to her lot. :
"I had fourteen bouquets In one even
i ing," she says, "and toe children gave me
I camly enough for the whole company all
| the time, and made afternoon parties, for
i me; and it was all perfectly lovely!" . j-
But does not all this excitement and
! late hours and hard work tire her? ...â  . ? \ j
She shakes her curly head emphatically.
| Sne "sleeps late mornings;" she says, and
j wakes up "bright as a dollar,'! and then
she studies a little daily, and often goes to
the park, and every day she hits "the
I jolliest kind of a time with the 'neighbor

that does not make her unhappy, for

more than they really were. Or was it not what he transferred to ug after all, but
the fare of his being that filled the room and warmed the hearts into sending forth
smiles?
For they did smile and laugh heartily, too, with no hidden meaning under the
smile. And there^are no immobile faces among them. The soal In each is not
masked â its secret thoughts are not kept within itself, lo feed on that which cannot
be known to its fellow-beings. I fancy they must be an honester lolfc than we whose
faces are trained to hide emotion for the benefit of the world to show what wÂ« feel not.
"What a pity they cannot talk," I said."
My informant shook his head.
'They are best 33 they are. Why would you have them change?"
"But they miss so much."
"They have much that they would lose in any other condition. No," he said, "I
think they would not ba willing to change if they could. I thinJt they are happier
than we.
"Signs are the natural language," he went on. "We had an Indian here from
the South who knew nothing of English, but when I talked with him by signs he
understood me instantly. Should you go to China or any country where the language
was utterly foreign to you, it would be necessary to resort to signs. For all the good
your language would do, you might as well be a deaf-mute."
So he reasoned, while I watched the bright faces around me. There teemed to be
no discontent, no troubled questionings, no malice or hatred. After the debaters had
finished and the judges decided in the affirmative they all arose silently and passed
from one to another, giving a pleasant greeting. It must have warmed their souls, it
must have made the world glad, for the eyes and the heart will not lie unless the lips
are there to do their bidding.
They were in another world from ours, I felt, and so did they, instinctively, as
they pressed my hand. But more eloquent than many a word wat the hearty soul
look that flashed from their eyes.
And again, as I turned away from the lighted room and the lighted faces and the
silence I heajd the half-articulate moan.
It no longer held any pathos. It tempered the rest. MURIEL BAILY.

The Old Cuartel at Monterey, Which Was Once Used as a Garrison by Fremont's Troops, but Later
Served as a Schoolhouse and Became the Scene of an Ironical Incident of Fate.
THIS INDUBITABLY WAS THE IRONY OF FATE
It is not often that a man innocent of a
capital crime is banged by a mob to a
school house balcony until be dies from
strangulation in sight of tha horrified
pupils. Equally rare is it for three
brothers whose love of justice is so
strong that they lead a party of lynchers,
ail to become convicted murderers, one
escaping the gallows only to be snot dead
in his tracks. Yet these things have hap
pened, and are part of the criminal his
tory of California, though perhaps not
before related in their natural sequence.
Thirty years ago there waa no more
peaceful town in. this State or elsewhere
than Monterey. It is quiet now, save in
the summer season, but it is uot the
same. The place seems to have lost the
subtile charm of those restful days before
the advent of the railroad. True, there
was an occasional bullfight, but it was
usually a tame affair and moved the
apathetic inhabitants scarcely more than
did the arrival of a steamer from "the
city," as San Francisco was vaguely desig
nated
One day, however, a startling event oc
curred, thoroughly arousing the people
and causing a sensation, which for many
years wa3 the talk of the community.
John Martin, a prominent rancher and
member of a well-known family, while on
vis way lo town from the Carmel Valley,
was shot by nn Indian called "Chaps Gre
gorio." The crime was without provoca- j
tiOn, and though the wound inflicted did
not prove fatal, the local physicians de
clared that the victim could not recover.
The story of the supposed tragedy
spread like wildtire and in a short time
the entire community was aroused as
seldom before. The guilty man was found,
frenzied with liquor, and brought to town
by a posse of citizens. After being fully
identified he was quickly committed to
jail by a Justice of the Peace; but he
never reached the quaint little granite
structure erected by Alcalde Walter Col
ton. Swift vengeance was demanded and
a mob, including the Bushton t>oys, hot
beaded youths, who up to then had never
been in any serious trouble, congregated to
lynch the prisoner. He was taken from
the officers and without ceremony hustled
to the.eastern end of the famous Cuartel
on California street.
This long two-story adobe buildinp,
erected during the Spanish occupation as
barracks or quarters for the troops, was
afierward used for the some purpose by
the arrpy of General Fremont. Later it

seem congruous, because street-sweeping
is labor, and labor is said to be akin to
hardship. But street-sweeping is to Mrs.
Frank tue one pleasure of her life. â ':"â

the one referred to lives on the "artistic

poses, and here at this time was conducted
the only public school in Monterey.
It was just before 1 o'clock when the
vigilantes reached the schooibouse. The
children had returned from luncheon and
thronged about the doors. Seeintr that
something unusual was about to occur
they ru-ned pell-mell to the scene of
action, nor did the vigorous ringing of the
bell prevent any but the timid ones from
witnessing the unceremonious hanging of
a man, who wore no cap to conceal his
distorted features, and who died with
curses on his lips after taking a great
drink of raw whisky,
The rope was thrown over the balcony
rail, Gregorio was hauled up hand over

given a few turns aroucd the corner post.
Just across the street was the home of
the Bushtons, who helped to swing this
drunken Indian aloft. T. c tiniest tots
who viewed the horrid spectacle will not j
forget it to their dying days, but it seemed
to imbuo these Bushton lads with a thirst
for human blood, as their future records
will attest.
During tbe winter of 1871 Monterey was
startled by another tragedy â the stabbing
to death of Martin Hedges on Pearl street
just outside tue saloon of Dionicio Kuez,
within a stone's throw of the old Cuartel.
It was learned that the murdered man
had frequently quarreled with George
Bushton regarding a band of cattle the {

his troubles to bis brother Jim, generally
known as "Jim Allen," and the slaying of
Hedges was the sequel of his story.
Both were held lor trial and in March,
1872, James was convicted of murder in the
first degree and sentenced to be hanged
oa May 17 of that year. His mother, a
hard-worlcing, earnest woman, immedi

she never relaxed, and in which she was
measurably successful. A respite was ob

NO USE FOR HAY.
A Horse That prefers JYleat to
J\r\y Other Kind of
Diet.
Tiie most extraordinary appetite known
in a horse belongs to Billy, a handsome
bay owned by A. Decourtieux & Son, the
butchers of the Pacific Fruit Market.
Horses are frequency known to show a
liking for sugar and instances are related
where they would drink beer, but who
ever saw a horse that was fond of meat
and hsh?
Biily's duties are to draw the firm's de
livery wagon and his stand is on Mer
chant street in front of the shop. Here he
is often on exhibition, eating with an
apparent relish steak, liver, tripe and in
short almost any variety of meat handed
him. Sometimes, after having bad his
till of oats and hay he refuses to munch
meat, but this seldom occurs.
Billy's appetite developed several
months ago. No one knew of it until one
day he was seen to reach into a butcher
cart that was tied just ahead of him and
calmly begin eating a steak. After that
he was fed often with the firm's wares,
and many a bet has been won and lost on
bis appetite.
The horse formerly varied his carnal
meais by purloininz fish, but he was cured
in a manner that was ludicrous to the
spectators, but very painful ior the equine
phenomenon.
He reached into a fish-wagon one day
when his olfactories detected the odor ot
his favorite smelt, but an active and bel
ligerent crab took offense at tne intrusion
and promptly fastened to bis lower lip.
Billy shook his head frantically and
whinnied in pain, but the crustacean held
on until he was crushed by being banged
against the side of the wagon. Since theu
the horse has kept clear of fish.
Billy is the favorite of the market, and
a strange teamster who had the temerity
to lay bis whip across his back onÂ« morn
ing to make him give room was nearly
mobbed by indignant butchers end fish
mongers. He is also the per of his own
er's family, and his siecfc hide and gen
eral evidence of good care show that he

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
The interest in the discussion of cloth
ing continues to absorb the attention of
many, for so beautiful and so reasonable
in price are the fabrics this season, offered
for our contemplation, that we are sorely
tempted, finding it difficult to choose be
tween the artistic, clinging foulards, the
exquisite, fairylike organdies, the wonder
fully lovely etamines ami grenadine-.
Indeed, the only truly satisfactory solu
tion of the problem would be, if possible,
to have at least one of each.
Alas! most of us cannot afford half a
dozen summer frocks, especially now that
a silk foundation is considered an abso
lute necessity, so we must do the best we
can, and make a careful study of our
coloring, our style, our figures, etc, if we
desire to obtain the most satisfactory re
sults with the smallest possible outlay.
Experience teaches us that it is better to
have one well-built, really fashion
able gown than a trunk full of non
descript garments.
Should you come to this decision I
should certainly say that a handsome
grenadine made with two waists, one for
the daytime and the other for evening
wear, would be admirable, but all the
materials employed must be of the best.
Should these prove too costly select a
foulard, as the fabrics will cost only half
as much; for on no account must the sav
ing be made by tiavinp a poor dressmaker.
That is a foolish economy. However, if
you have the time and ability you can i
save many a dollar if you design your
own toilettes and know exactly what you
desire, and 10 assist those who are so gifted
I have written about the latest.
faquirv JÂ»loclels.
Several of these are exciting the enthu
siastic admiration of Parisian theater
goers, for in "The Snob ' Mme. Grainer
wears in the first act a delightful gown of
pale mauve embroidered mousseline de j
soie over a white silk skirt, with a sash of j
the same soft material in a deep shade of
violet. The result is truly artistic. The
second creation worn by this bright act- i
ress is a teagown composed of a delicate
shade of shell pink crepe de chine. In
serted at regular intervals are broad bands
of guipure and a sole, and epaulets of black
tulle, spangled and bordered with steel,
completed it. Later she appears in a
pearl-gray cloth dress of an exqnisite cut,
made over pink taffeta, the bolero worn
with it being all of white silk cord and
steel, opening over a pleated chemisette
of pink chiffon. But Paquin is consid
ered to have simply surpassed himself in
the ball dress. Exert your imaginatton if '
you would have some idea of this fas
cinatingly, lovely creation. It is long and
clinging and is of white lace, glistening
with moonlight spangles, and over it
trails great branches of scarlet pink
orchids. These are embroidered upon
the material. The centers of the flowers
are a blaze of jewels.
Black lace over white satin is quite the
rage for the moment, and Chantilly
flounces have advanced 50 per cent in
value.
A FloWer Ball.
All Paris is discussing the floral ball
given a few weeks ago by the Baronne
Rogers, at which, says a correspondent,
"all the ladies wore colored tulie dresses,
draped with flowers, and the neck and
shoulders so surrounded with them they
seemed rising from a basket of flowers;
one large flower to match in the hair.
Marquise de Rosambo wore orchids;
Baronne Rogers, pink roses; Comtease
d'Aramon, hydrangea of bluish tint; Mme.
de Champgrand wore white mauve lilac,
and red poppies were worn by Vicomtesse
de Luppe. Tne effect of this floral trim
ing was extremely pretty."
What a charming idea ! How well such
a ball could be given here, as a profusion
oi roses would transform a great ballroom
into a perfect bower, and guests so ar
rayed would make the scene a brilliant
one.
Lace Blouses.
In Pans they are being raved over, and
the few that have just reached New York
have created a genuine sensation. One of J
them is composed of "cerise satin of a I
peculiarly luminous tint." Crepe lisse of j
a lighter shade completely covers the

Such beautiful creations continue the
popularity of odd bodices, that is 10 say,
of the bodices which are not of the same

worn, although dressmakers and leading
fashion journals have done ail in their
power to banish them. Some pre*tty ones

The Latest Ghit-Ghat.
So much lace is used nowadays that it
may inlerest many to learn that Flemish
lacerankers receive from 14 to 17 cents a
day for their labor, and a laceworker's
day begins at about 6 a. m., summer and
winter, and only ends toward midnight,
after a long evening spent directly under
the rays of a power:ul lamp.
But few realize how numerous are the
women who support themselves com
fortably by making ramekin and swiffla
cases. Great ingenuity is frequently shown
in the selection of colors and designs, and
the spring ones are reported to have odd
cnmkly handles of pure white, but tbe
cases are tinged aronnd the edges with
red, pine, green, yellow ana some times
with even blue. With them are used the
red-tipped daisy, the blue foreet-me-not,
or the buttercup. These tiny flowers en
twine the little handles and again appear
in the menu cards, being either tied to
them or painted thereon.
Delft cassettes, menu cards and china
are pretty and serviceable for daily use,
tut lack any suggestions of novelty.
From London direct comes the informa
tion that the most fashionable nolepaper
is of the tint known as "Paris gray." It
comes with a narrow white margin. How
ever, when novel shades are not obtaina
ble, you can make no mistake in using tbe
best quality of cream white paper. Never
allow any strong perfume to find a place
in your desk. Just a breath that reminds
one of fresh violets is delightful. By Just
such little thines is a woman judged, for
to any one blessed with delicate and re
fined sensibilities a strong, common odor
is like a discord in music, and the sooner
some women realize the fact that it is
wiser to purchase soap than cheap cologne
the better, and if you cannot afford the
most delicious of perfumes, how much
better to do without any. The use of nis
powder seems to be but little appreciated,
but it is so delicious that once having
tried it you will not willingly discard your
little silken sachet-, four of which should
be sewn In each petticoat, and two in
every bodice.

STRANGE CASE OF
WILLIAM McLEOD
Convicted of Manslaughter
in a Very Peculiar
Manner.
Declared Guilty Because His
Wife Died of Heart
Failure.
Unforlunate Rsult of an Attempt to
Ejct a Wrmn Who Intruded
Up n His Hcme.
William McLeod, convicted of man
slaughter for causing the death of hii
wife, was not sentenced by Judge Cook
yesterday, the court expressing a desire to
hear testimony touching the previous
character of the prisoner before passing
sentence.
Attorney Arthur Mack announced that
he had several witnesses to prove the good
character of the defendant, and he also
drew attention to the fact tbat the jury
had recommended the prisoner to the ex
treme mercies of the court.
McLeod'i case is a remarkable one in
some respects. The information alleged
manslaughter without malice, and the
proof failed to show that the accused had
used any intentional violence upon his
wife. There was a witness who swore that
McLeod choked nis wife, but this was
discredited by the medical examination
and was denied by the defendant. Ha
admitted that he wa? engaged in a strug
gle with a woman whom he was attempt
ing to eject from his house, and that in the
melee his wife was thrown against a cbair
and fell to the floor. There was no real
I injury to her, however, except that the
excitement caused her to have an attack
of heart failure that caused her death.
This was the opinion of the physicians
who made a post-mortem examination.
One of the doctors said thnt any excite
ment might have been fatal; tbat she
would have been liable to droD dead on
seeing a runaway horse on the street. She
was very friendly with the woman with
whom her husband was struggling, and
the excitement brought on the fatal at
tack. He complained that this woman
nad made trouble between himself and
his wife and would not leave, though ha
had ordered her to do so.
It was the theory of the prosecution that
McLeod must have known that bis wife
was suffering from heart disease and tbat
under the circumstances be was morally
responsible for her death, even though he
was without malice, for the reason that at
the time of the occurrence he was in the
commission of an unlawlui act â lhat is to
say, h* was committing assault and bat*
tery on a human being.
McLeod's attorney raised the conten
tion that his client was in bis own house,
and that he had a right to eject any per
son who was oDnoxious to him.
The response to this was that the per
son referred to had been invited into the
house by Mrs. McLeod, and that if Mc-
Leod wished to eet rid of her there was a
legal way to accomplish that end; that
the courts were open to him, and that he
could enforce his rights by an action at
law.
McLeod denied that be knew anything
about his wife having heart disease, bnt
the jury appeared to bold tbat tie was not
entirely blameless, and though not will
ing to let him go unscathed returned the
most lenient verdict sanctioned by the
code.

San Francisco, May 6. 1897.
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco â Gemtlemen :
At the regular meeting of tne board ot direc
tors of the Merchants' Ascociation held to-day,
it was unanimously decided to respectfully
petit on your honorable Board to devote the
$3000 heretofore appropriated for the fourth of
July celebration this year to the relief of the
unemployed, provided it can legally be done.
While fully appreciating the patriotic
motives that have promptid the use of this
sum annually for the celebration of our
National Independence, we cannot bnt feel, in
view of the fact that a number of our feilow
citizens are sorely in need of the necessities of
life, that both patriotism and duty will be
better subserved this year by transferring the
amount to the committee now in charge of
the re lief of the unemployed in our midst.
Believing that such a course will meet with
the unanimous approval of the taxpayers of
this City, and trusting that your honorable
board will be able to com animate this worthy
result, we remain very respectfully yours,

might â¢ properly be called the father of the
â¢ game; he was certainly the greatest whist
â authority of his time, and was the first to
'make a scientific study of the subject. Hoyle
â¢â¢â was born in 1672, and for about ten years of
: . lifeâ from 1735 to 1745â he taught whist as a
profession and charged a guinea a lesson. In
â November, 1742, Hoyie issued his first book
on the game; it was called "Short Treatise."
Inside of one year five editions were published
'â¢ and sold. Hoyle died In Welbank street,
Cavendish square, London, August 27, 1769,
- aged 97. At the time of his death the seven
teenth edition was in the printer's hands,
From his first edition we quote the following:
HOYLE'B GENERAL RCLES FOE BEGINNERS.
We ask our readers to carefully observe the
following leads and note how few there are
-"" that differ from the leads of 1897. Hoyle
starts out by saying: When you lead, begin
With the best suit In your' band. With King,
queen, knave, fourln suit, lead king; witn five
â¢ in suit, lead knave. . . .-â" 'â  , "â !*
With queeD, knave, 10, four in suit, lead
queen; with five in suit, lead 10. [Note this
lead.-Ed.] '"V?/- -^ * '
; â¢ If you have five of the smallest trumps and
not one good card in other suits, lead a trump
(or trump out). r â¢ - â  -
â  With ace, king and three or four small
trumps begin with a small one. . \
-.With ace, king, knave ana three small, be
gin with the king.
With king, queen and three or four small
trump*, begin with a smalL
' With king, queen, 10 and three small
" trumps, begin with the king. 4aljlÂ§iÂ§
.. With queen, knave and four small, begin
â with a small one.
With ace, king and two small trumps, begin
- with a small one.
With king, queen and two small trumps, be
gin with a small one, without going into too
mÂ»ny of the plain suit holdings. This is suffi
cient to show that the leads were about the
" iame 150 years ago as they are now.
' -Many of the pitfalls that whist-players fall
â  into, even at the present day, were pointed out
" by .Hoyle, and none of them were so dangerous
as. leading trumps from four without the
â -Â©roper strength. The deal given below is
.taken from the first edition of his work. Many
\ot our readers will no doubt recognize it.
This same deal "occurred in actual play"
about once a year. It is ' like the "sea ser
pent"â bobs up itÂ« head about so often. It
Illustrates the danger of leading trumps from
four, even with two honors. Souths hand is a
â¢ remarkable one. A quart-major in diamonds,
a tierce-msjjr in hearts, the ace and king of
spades and lour trumps, including; king
knave. If South leads a trump from -this
holding, and it don't matter which one, North
â¢nd South, can be shut out without a trick.

A "Flute Hand."
While we were up at Sacramento, a week or |
two ago, to attend the opening meeting of the i
youngest and largest whist club on the Pacific ;
Coast, we listened to a very Interesting talk j
from Frank Miller, one of the whist enthusi- i
asts of the capital city. Mr. M. Her was very j
entertaining, and gave a description of several j
innovations in the game. that "Cavendish" |
never dreamed of, and even Hamilton omitted ;
in his second edition of "Modern Scientific;
Whist." After giving his hearers a descrip
i tion of several kinds of hands, such as slam,
YarborougU, Pat, piano, full, flushes, and
bands without a trump, and hands with 9 i
"spot" high, etc., all of which we knew a |
little some' about, he stated the prettiest |
if not the most peculiar hand he ever heldâ J
at a whist tableâ was what President Mott
called a ''flute hand." This was a corker, or
a "coup," so to speak.
We once filled in the . middle, but â we
couldn't "draw" the inference of what a flute ]
j hÂ«d to do with a whist hand. He was asked !
to explain. "Well," he said, "when I hold !
this kind of a hand it always put rue in mind j
of Patrick when he first came over. He was
just alter. coming off the ship, when they
passed a Chinese laundry, and on the front
door was a big red poster with the usual
quaint characters, straight and crooked lines,
dots and dashes, etc., and his wife asks:
â¢Patrick, what is that on the door-can you
raid it?' 'No, darlin',' he says, 'l can't raid
it, but if I had me flute here I could play it.' "
John T. Mitchell's NeW Whist Work
A few weeks ago we rave a short mention of
a new whist book that just came from the
press. A. R. Metcalfe,*. one of the leading;
whist experts of Chicago, says in an article to
the Chicago Inter Ocean that Mitchell's new
work is a welcome and much-needed contri
bution to modern wnist literature. .
In style it is vigorous and concise, and, as In
all the writings of this author, there is never
any ambiguity or question as to his { position
on any point at issue. .
The most important feature of the book is.
that giving meiaods of play lot every itind of ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 9, 1807.
. duplicate whist for any number of players. '
1 In this the work cannot be too highly praised.
j Interclub, progressive, single-table, Whltfield
i and Howell progressive, ladies and gentle
men's, and team schedules are given fu'uy and
clearly, leaving apparently nothing In this j
j line to L.c added or desired. To all clubs
where whist is played, and to all families
fond of the king of games, this part of the
I work is of the greatest value.
For instance, a club of forty members deslr
' ing to have a series of games to establish in
â  dividual records, by reference to this book can
once find a schedule which will bring each
j member once with and twice against every
j other member. Or, with a party of eight
\ ladies ond eight gentlemen, where it is de
sired that each lady play onÂ«e with each gen
tleman and once against each lady, and an
individual record preserved, a schedule will
be fouud which will enable them to accom-
I plish their purpose without trouble or loss of
time.
L ads and Inferences of modern whist are
condense! by the author into some thirty
pages, but are given very clearly and will be
iound very useful by students of the game. A
new system of leads, reconciling some of the
opposite schools of the day, is also sjggested
by tne author, and is referred for considera- j
I tlon to the whist experts of the country. The j
i most important chxnges consist of the lead of
I king, from king, queen and three or more, and
i of the fourth best from ace and any number of
\ small cards.
The first proposition will not probably meet
with serious opposition, but it is doubtful
| whether the low lead Irom ace and more than
four small cards will be considered tenable.
In addition to the features above mentioned
| the work contains a brief but interesting hls
| torical sketch, the laws of whist and a pro
> gramme for congresses. There is also a draft
', of by-laws for whist cluds, modeled closely
! after those of the Chicago Whist Ciub, one
.of the most successful organizations in the
I country.
j /\mericar\ Whist League Jrophy.
I This beautiful trophy will decorate the
i rooms of the Hamilton Club for all time to
come.
The Brooklyn Eagle says: The Hamilton
Club of Philadelphia in defeating the New
: Jersey WhiÂ«t Club Saturday became the per- j
j manent holders of the challenge trophy of the
j American WhiÂ»t League, having won it twenty !
! times. Of the other clubt who successfully j
' competed for it the Albany Club had 11, St. j
Paui 5, Minneapolis 4, Americans of Boston 4.

I New York and Philadelphia each 1. The
1 players are G. Remak (csptsln), M. C. Work)
E. A. Baliard and F. P. Mogridge. It is re
: ported that the members will now rest on
| their laurels and not play together as a team
| again.
The success of the Hamilton team is no
I dcubt owing to their fine team work. The
I personnel of the team has not changed in
J thrte yean. To separate or break up such a
! fine team seems a pity, but a club the sisa of
j Hamilton should hare several teams of equally
! good players. Why not each one of the four
captain a new team?

THE METHOD OF \ GREAT TREATMENT

WHICH rURKD HIM AFTKR EVERY-
THING ELSE 1 AILIJ),
Falnfal diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than thejnost severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his Jhroubies. But providential inspiration
came to his aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural vise and vigor, and
be now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free 1 mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam nut a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some meu and mean a life-
time of happiness to most of us. Write to

Explanation.
The arrow flies with tbe wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
ra.mail, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; Ito
iherms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "bizh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accomDanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloud v weather and rains.
"Lows'" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
â¢north and south along the. coast, rain is probable;
bat when the "low is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a â¢â¢high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weÂ«ther may be expected !n summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
wiii produce an opposite result.

Cathedral, St. Brigid's, Holy Gross, St.
Francis and Hatred Heart. A feature of j

Thirty years ago St. Paul's Lutheran Church :
held its first meetings at Dashaway Hall, then
quite a prominent place lor society gather
ings, and now the building and name have
â  lone since become a thing of the past. J The
congregation, on tne other hand, now meets in
its own beautiful church edifice, corner of
Eddy and Gough streets, in a locality then
. little known, and far out in the hills. ..
--â¢ In view of such changes the members of St.
' Paul thought the thirtieth anniversary of its
first organization a matter for congratulation
and worthy of a celebration. Its continued
existence and growth, its development from
â mall beginnings to its present strength and
usefulness, and the gratifying fact that it has
enjoyed the ministrations of the same clergy
man, the Rev. J. M. Buehler, from its founda
tion day to the * present, all combined to
awaken the desire to make the occasion one
of thanksgiving and praise.

Curious Way in Which the
Philatelic Treasures Were
Discovered. (
We'ls, Fargo & Co. Recovered Them j
Through the Enthusiasm of a j
Stamp-Collector. .
The Golden Gate Park Memorial
Museum is about to be presented with an
addition to its collection that is an unique
as its story is interesting. \ â 
The donation consists of the dies from
which the stamps of the famous Pony
Express, the first mail vice across the
continent, were printed, which have Jain
in the establishment of a local lithograph- ;
ins house since the time when trie express
was first started in the early fifties.
Some time â¢ ago a young relative of
Joseph Britton of the firm of Britton &
Key contracted the philatelic fever, and
having '; heard that the lithographers had
prepared f : the plate- I and : printed - the
stamps, asKed his uncle whether it was
not possible that some of the old stamp?
were lying â  about among the samples of
the firm's early work.
These stamps are now very valuable,
some of them, particularly the $4 issue,
being I worth $8, and a full set, including
$4, $2, $1, 25-cent and 10-cent issues, being
worth $15 or more..' ; Mr. Britton could not
find any of the old stamps ; because they
had all been } turned over to Wells, Fargo
& Co. at the time the express was discon
tinued, but he found the 'plates and de
cided to print a new lot for his nephew.
'â  'He called at Wells, Fargo '& Co. office
to ascertain- the* proper colors, which in
tne originals were red, green, blue, black
and chocolate, and by some chance was
shown a spurious lot that had come into
the possession of the company at a lime
when some one had counterfeited the
stamps. The colors were prepared, the
plates .touched up to give the stamps a
smart appearance and a largo number of
sets struck off. â .'. - i; -. . :> â '::. '.-â¢-
With visions of vastly advantageous
trades floating before his eves tne nephew
took the stamps to various dealers and
tried to "swap' them for others that he
needed to till out his collection. The
practical eyes of the philatelic experts at
once detected tne facts that the colors
were a little off, the paper different than
the original and the lines changed and
more distinct in some portions than they
should hare been. No trades were made,
but the matter caused so much comment
among the philatelists that the story
came to the ears of Wells, Fargo <fc Co.,
who owned the plates, though they had
been in the possession of Britton & Key
for forty years or more.

made a demand for the plates and they
were turned over by the lithographers.
Being of no further use to the express
company it was decided to present them
to the museum as a souvenir of the days
when brave and daring men faced the
dangers of Indians and buzzards to carry
the news of the argonauts and their or
tunes in the gold fields to waiting friends
across the plains and mountains.
There was nothing out of the way in
printing the stamps, as they have long
since ceased to be of any value except as
philatelic curios, and Mr. Britton says
that he did not think that there wouid be
the slightest comment on the matter or
he would not have consented to print the
stamps.

, The old story of Prometheus is a parable,
an allegory. Prometheus was on terms of
intimacy with , the i gods. ' From them he
stole fire, and gave it to men. For this sin
he was bound to the rocks of Mount Cau- X
' casus, , and : vultures were " set 4 upon him.
They only ate his liver. This grew again
;as fast as it was pecked away. Are his suf-
ferings to be imagined ? Yes, and realized-
Take a modern interpretation of the par-
able. There is no cooking without fire. In
cooking and eating the mischief lies. The
stomach is overtasked, the bowels become
clogged, they cannot dispose \of the food
that is given them. The impurities back
up on the liver. .Then come the vultures. ',
The j sufferings | from |an outside,", visible
hurt, are a mere pin-scratch to the torments
; of a diseased liver."

sure as the needle of the compass. There
is no more need of suffering from dyspepsia
than there is of hanging one's self. -
