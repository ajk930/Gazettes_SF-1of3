WASHINGTON, D, C, Feb. 23.-Sena

respondent to-night, begged to be excused
from further expressing his views on mat

"You can readily understand why I am
reluctant to talk of these matters further
" than I have," said he. "It would be in
exceedingly bad taste."
Hi the course of a casual conversation,
â¢ however. Senator Sherman expressed his
disgust because of the purported interview
with him printed in the New York Jour

day morning. Senator Sherman was
Â quoted in those' papers as favoring a war
with Spain. He denounced it as a lie.
"Of course I would make no such state

General Johnson Makes Serious
â¢ Charges Against the Ad
ministration.
it Is Claimed That the Machinery ol
the Government Is Used to
Crush Cuba.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Feb. 23.â Among the
distinguished men invited to participate
in the mass-meeting of the Cuban sympa
thizers, which was held Saturday night
- last in Music Hall, was General Bradley
T. Johnson, the ex-Confederate, of Rich
mond. A letter from the general dated
February 18 was received to-day by John
F. Cahiil, secretary of the Cuban relief
committee. Johnson was in Havana when
General Fitzhugh Lee first arrived there,
and gave the latter much valuable assist
ance in scannincr the situation. ' After ex
pressing regret at his inability to be pres
sent he writes:
John Randolph's sneer about the combina
tion between the Puritan and the blackleg,
Quincy Adams and' Henry Clay, would be
Â» changed into a horselaugh at this new firm of
the President and the inquisitionâ the succes
sor of George Washington in an alliance with
. J.he grand inquisitor. Explain this mystery;
1 ir.i'kc it known to all men that the money of
â  "â "'n in permeates the most secret recesses of the
â¢ \jdministra.ion. More, Assistant Secretary of
_. .the Treasury, is the regularly retained counsel
for the Spanish Government at the city of
New York, and the counsel of the Spanish
embassy in Washington has just been assigned
by the Attorney-General of the United States
to assist the United States District Attorney,
Wiliiam T. Mar bury of Baltimore, in prosecut
ing Roloff and Luis, indicted in that city for
.' the violation of the neutrality laws.
The Spanish Government, therefore, not
- only directs the operations of the revenue
* cutters of the United States to assist Spain
* 'and prevent the Cubans from getting am
munition from the United States,' but It
actually directs the operations of grand juries
.* and of courts. I do not believe that such a
thing ever occurred in an English-speaking
â¢'' "court before such juries were invented that
= foreign sovereign would appear by counsel in
.a prosecution ol a private citizen by his own
Government and assist that Government in
=â¢ executing Its own laws when at any moment
V'-ii-r might break out between the two coun
* tries.
There must be some reason for tnis close
league and alliance, but who can tell what it
>â¢Â»"? The Cubans are doing exactly what our
ancestors did from 1775 ; to 1781. They will
!'â â 'â¢ in just as our ancestors did, notwithstand
ing the efforts of the President of the United
States in putting them down. Neither Presi
dent, nor revenue cutters, nor special counsel
can turn back the tide of time or prevent Cuba
from becoming free. Yours truly,
BRAOLEY T. Johnson.
. Secretary Cahiil, who was in Cuba
. j-iroughout the ten years' war, says he
Win answer the question in General John
son's letter, "What is the reason?"
"The Mora claim of $3,000,000," said Mr.
Cahiil, "was paid by the Spanish Govern
ment to a syndicate of lawyers in New
York composed of friends and relatives of
President Cleveland and parties directly
. connected with the administration, ln
return for this a surances were given to
the Spanish Government that Spain's in

Gibson's Hinging Resolution Relating to
â  Outrages in i.ttba. '- â '-.''â¢
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 23âRepre
sentative Gibson (R.) of Tennessee intro
duced in the House to-day the following
resolution :
Whereas, Many American citizens have
been Illegally and without sufficient cause
arrested and imprisoned in the Island of Cuba
by the Cuban authorities; and whereas, some
of these Americans thus Wrongfully arrested
and imprisoned have been thrust into dark
and foul dungeons, and some of them have
been denied the necessities of life, and some of
them have been maltreated without trial and
some have been inhumanly done to death;
and whereas, in a majority of cases the Ameri
cans thus unlawfully arrested and bar
barously dealt with have been denied
the trial guaranteed them by the treaties be
tween the United States and Spain and have
been treated in a manner unworthy of civil
ized nations or a people protesting to be Chris
tians; and, whereas, it is well known that
many Americans have been maltreated and
some of them butchered, not because of any
fault of theirs but to enable Spanish officials to
vent their hatred of the United States and to
exhibit their animosity toward Americans in
general; and, wheieas, these wicked, Illegal
and barbarous deeds of the Spanish officials
in Cuba, sustained as they have been by
the lawful authorities of Spain, are an
international insult and injury to the
whole people and Government of the United
States; and whereas, the lurther submission
of the Government' of the United States to
these atrocities and outrages upon our citizens
ln Cuba will degrade our Government in the
estimation of the lovers of liberty and justice
the world over, and do at the same time a
grievous wrong and humiliation to every citi
zen of the United States, an injury to one be
ing an injury to all; therefore, to the end that
justice be done, the rights of American citi
zenship asserted and vindicated, the honor of
our country sustained and the laws of human
ity and civilization enforced.
Resolved. That the President be and is hereby
authorized and directed to demand of the
Spanish authorities in Cuba, the immediate
restoration to liberty of every American citi
zen, native born or naturalized, now impris
oned by them in the island of Cuba.
Resolved, Further, that In support of that de
mand, the President be, and is hereby author
ized and directed to accompany it by the pres
ence of a sufficient number of United States
warships to make the demand good, and if
said demand is .not granted within twenty
four hours, that the city of Havana, and if
need be, other ports of Cuba.be bombarded
until said demand is fully complied with and
all of the said American citizens delivered to
the commander of our warships.
The resolution was referred to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.
CO A CERXImI G RUIZ'S JD TH.
Slills Asks for All th* Correspondence
on the Subject.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 23.-The
full text of the resolution introduced in
the Senate to-day by Senator 1 Mills of
Texas is as follows:
Resolved, That tie President be requested to
send to tne Senate, if in his opinion it is not
Incompatible with the public Interest, a state
ment of such facts as may be in tne possession
of the State Department, concerning the
arrest, imprisonment and death of Dr. Ricardo
Ruiz, in the jail at Guanabacoa, on the island
of Cuba, and the correspondence between our
Government and Spain, and the correspond
ence between the Stale Department and
Consul-General Lee on the same subject.
GREAT ALARM IN HAVANA.
Authorities Try to Prevent Demonstra
tions Against Uncle Sam.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says:
Havana is alarmed. The Spaniards are
wildly excited against Consul-General Lee
and the Americans.
The report was . circulated to-day that
American warships were coming to
Havana by request of Consul-General Lee
and the indignation of the volunteers was
so intense over the report that, fearing
demonstrations against the United States,
the Marquis of Ahumada privately
called to his office the colonels
of the battalions of volunteers in this city
and assured them that the report was ab
solutely false and that General Lee, in in
vestigating the death of Dr. Ruiz, only
obeyed instructions from the State De
partment in Washington, given in a
friendly, peaceful spirit.
The Marquis expressed his full confi
dence in the American Government, slat
ing that in his opinion no reason exists
for believing that the policy of the next
administration in the United States will
differ from that of the present
He also denied that there was any con
firmation of the capture of insurgents of
the town of Bayaomo, and there had
therefore been indignant patriotism
aroused among loyal Spaniards by tbe re
port. Whether the effect of Marquis
Ahumada's speeches, and in general of all
the Spanish authorities here to prevent a
terrible conflict, will prove successful can
not be foretold.
The fact is that the Spanish volunteers
i and merchants openly say that if any
American warship, enter the bay of
Havana, they will attack the American
Consulate and by their own acts and
words declare war upon the United States.
Printed cards addressed to "Loyal
Spaniards" are circulated, in which ap
peals are made to their patriotism to
revive "the manly spirit" of the volunteers
during th. last war. which means an invi
tation to repeat the anarchical scenes of
1869. 1871 and 1875, in which a large num
ber of murders were committed in tins city.
If no appeal for warships has been
made the fact remains, none the less
tbat they are needed, and that the Ameri
can Government could not send its naval
vessels anywhere to protect the lives and
interests of its citizens with better reason.
Under the circumstances tne releas? of
Juan Sanguilly is almost impossible, as
the Spaniards would think that his release
.pad been required by the American "Gov
ernment and an uprising would imme
diately follow with great danger to the
lives of many innocent person*.
At a late hour to-night it was stated
thatConsni-General Lee ha.i received from
the State Department, tne answer that
the Spanish Government has given an offi
cial request, 'made through Minister Taylor
at Madrid that an inquest be held in the
case of the death of Dr. Ruiz and also that
inquiry be made in the cases of all Ameri
can citizens imprisoned in Cuba to satisfy
the American government.
A well-informed person here says that
General Lee sent his resignation to Wash
ington, but withdrew it upon pressure
from Secretary Olney. 'â¢ < -â¢
The assurance was given him that his
attitude in the case of Dr. .Ruiz would be
sustained by the administration. After
he received a dtspatch from Washington
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 24, 1897.
TOO LATE!
Monday General Lee denied that be had
resigned. " r 'â¢'- Â ,""- ."
The Marquis of Abumada has made
every effort to satisfy the demands of
General Lee, and also to prevent any hos
tile demonstration against him.
The Governor of the fortress of La Ca
bana was summoned yesterday to the pal
ace to confer with the Marquis of Abu
mada. It is impossible to learn exactly
what the Marquis said to him, but it is
supposed that be spoke about the Ameri
can prisoners in the fortress and the need
of taking special measures to protect them
case of a sudden revolt of the volun
teers in the city.
A strong article, inciting the Spaniards
against the Americans, is in type, all
ready to appear in El Puebla, but tbe
Governor summoned the editor of that
paper to his office and advised him not to
print anything that would further arouse
public feeling at tbis time.
The Cubans here are in a state of terror
over the attitude of the Spaniards and
their threats to take vengeance upon all
Cubans they can lay . their hands on, if
the capture of Bayamo by the Insurgents
is confirmed. At the same time all reports
irom the field are to the effect that hot
fighting is going on in the country.

ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 23.â A dispatch
to the Asty from Canea says that the for
eign warships are now rigorously block
ading the coast of Crete. The British
torpedo-boats are especially active, rap
idly steaming along the coast and keeping
a sharp lookout to prevent the, landing of
troops, provisions or munitions of war.
Many vessels have be n stopped by the
blockading fleets and not allowed to pro
ceed until they satisfactorily proved that
they were engaged in legitimate business.
So strict is the blockade that tbe carrying
of letters to. the Pureus from the forces of
Colonel Vassos, the commander of the
Greek army of occupation, is â . prohibited.
.. .The entire country is in a state of intense
anxiety and unrest over the situation and
there is the widest speculation as to what
the final outcome will be. The people are
deeply incensed against the powers for
their intervention in Crete and their atti
tude is causing some apprehension in
court and Government circles. King
George to-day issued a proclamation that
is intended to cool the popular passions
and thus avert what might prove a
national crisis, j He enjoins the country to
be calm and dignified and to confide in the
Government, which, he says, is doing
everything possible to" uphold the honor
of Greece and maintain the rights of the
Hellenic people.
CANEA, -Crete, Feb. 23.â Great excite
ment.was caused here last night by smart
rifle firing to the westward of th. town. It
was soon learned that the firing was tak
ing place between the Turkish outposts
and Christian insurgents and the report
spread that the outposts bad been driven
back and the insurgents were approaching
the town. Crowds of residents went to the
ramparts of -. the city and anxiously
watebed the outcome of the fighting. The
I
firing ceased in a short lime without
either side having gained any material ad
vantage, or, so far as knoâ¢n, causing any
casualties.
A Turkish warship in Suda Bay and the
soldiers in the arsenal there to-day fired
repeatedly at the village which was shelled
on Sunday by the foreign fleets. There
was absolutely no reason for this attack,
except that the Turks were desirous of
provoking an occasion for further inter
vention on the part of the European
powers. A white flag was flying over the
position occupied by the insurgent?, but
this did not prevent the firing. The in
surgents, understanding probably the
motive of the Turks, did not reply fo the
fire.
The leaders of the insurgents who were
shelled Sunday have made through the
Greek commodore a formal protest.against
the action of the foreign admirals. Tbey
declare in their protest that, acting in
obedience to the powers, they refrained
from actual hostilities against the Mos
lems as long as it was possible, but tne
Turks having shelled their position for
two days, they were finally compelled to
reply to the fire. The protesters ask
whether the powers are determined to
allow the Turks to destroy the Christians
in Crete like they did the Armenians in
Anatolia.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 23.â The Paris cor

that the Austrian War Office is makin.;

Joseph spends hours every day with his

that the sailing of five Austrian warships

RUSSIA'S IRON HAND.
Strongest Method of Co-rcion to Keep
Jlttlgnrla Quia'.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 23.âA special
cable dispatch to * the Herald } from St.
Petersburg says: Tne Government still
holds for th_ utmost firmness being ap
| plied to * the ' Cretan business, because it
i sees' clearly .the endless complications
otherwise in view during the coming
months,'and if Crete is to be given to the
; Greeks nothing can hold the Bulgarians
bad., for it was- only by the strongest
coercion Russia could keep Bulgaria
quiet.
England's' and Italy's conduct in seem
ing to cast doubt upon tbe accord of tbe
powers, when it Is here considered that a
most perfect understanding is necessary
to assure the peace of Europe, has made a
very disagreeable impression and once
more given rise to bitter expression about
England's perfidiousness and so forth. As
to the report published that Russia was
preparing for war, it is the sheerest non
sense. 7*Â«77
The action of the American Senators in
adopting at such a critical moment a
resolution sympathizing with Greece is
looked upon as very mischievous and un
called for. It received much severe criti
cism here. ..â . a-v.:-;

Has Been Very 11, but Is Now Declare!
Out of Dangerâ Corbett's
Improve. Form-
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 23.â path of
the management of tho approaching
world's championship battle is not strewn
and springy with roses after all.
True, there is no evidence of a possible
hitch in the new law or a clash with the
authorities, but there are internal troubles
.â and serious troubles they are at that.
First and foremost among these is the fact
that the tail and sunny-headed Cornish
man, who for years has professed hunger
for a chance to cut nimble Jim Corbett
into ribbons, has grown sulky. He does
not want to play in any backyard appar
ently. While Ido not believe that Bob is
troubled with anything like premoni
tions of a chilly sensation in the neighbor
hood of his pedal extremities, still he has
begun to quibble over trifles in such a
manner that somebody is apt to cast as
persions in his direction ere long. His
complaint is that the Marquis of Queens
berry rules, as interpreted by. Referee
G. orge Siler, are not to his liking. The
particular subdivision which permits
either pugilist to thump away with a free
hand while in a clinch and to dash in
after a breakaway is the stumbling block.
...When the big match was made both
Corbett and Fitz decided to indulge in no
hitting in the clinches or breaks, but after
both had thought it over they concluded
that what would be sauce for tbe goose
would be sauce for the gander, so to
speak, and the agreement between them
was altered to the extent that -{he time
honored Queensberry rules should be al
lowed to stand without amendment, thus
permitting the clinch hitting. This un
derstanding pleased Siler immensely, for
be immediately saw whero he was going
to be relieved of a great deal of labor and
responsibility and where the danger of
foul claiming was to be in a great measure
avoided.
Siler was by no means exclusive in his
announcement that both men showed a
manly spirit by agreeing to play the en
tire gamut in their mill. The old-time
referee explained to me shortly after hia
arrival here that he never knew of two
fighters to stand by a pledge not to hit in
the breakaways. They invariably forgot
all about the agreement in the excitement
of the bout and unintentionally fouled.
This always left the referee in a ticklish
position, for in reality he should give tne
decision against the man who first broke
the agreement.
But to revert to the present case: Siler
was just congratulating himself on the
easy time he was going to have in the
ring with the big fighters when he ran
against the Fitzsimmons snag. For some
reason or other Bob does not now want
the clause which permits hitting in the
clinches to stand. Up till "to-day every
body has been under the impression that
he heartily approved of this privilege, for
to these who are familiar with the Cor
nishman' a ring tactics aud with his abil
ity to get in such wonderful execution at
close quarters it seemed plain that the
rule would operate far more to his advan
tage than to Corbett's.
Siler did not know that trouble was in
store for him until to-day, and the new
was quite a shock to him. A strenuous
effort has been made by all who have
knowledge of this new stumbling block to
keep the matter quiet in the hope that the
difficulty will be adjusted before it can
reach any serious state.
It appears that Siler provided both Cor
bett and Fitzsimmons last night with
copies'. of ( the unadulterated Marquis of
Queensberry rules. He explained to them
that in his opinion the public would be
better satisfied and the fighters them
selve if there were no amendments or spe
cial provisions of a radical nature incor
porated in the list of regulations. The
battle was to be for the championship of
the world and be decided strictly accord
ing to rules, so that neither of the men or
their backers could say after the contest
that any unfairness had been indulged in
or any special privilege allowed.
Corbett read the rules over carefully
and said he could see nothing in them to
which be could find objection. They

MR. CORBETT'S LETTER.
(INTERCEPTED.)
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 23, 1897. M
To the Journal-Examiner (Soft Thing):
I write you in joyfulness of heart to-day, for I am sure I will win
the fight â is, get the money. It has just been pointed out to me j
that you have been favoring me all along between the lines, as it
were â 1 am very grateful. You favored Sharkey in the last
fight, you know, and Mr. Earp did the rest.
1 observe that you adopted my suggestion to send a lady reporter
to write me up. You are going to send two, you say. How delighted
they will be !
1 now take back all I said about the rawness of your work. 1
think you've the brainiest staff on earth. lam writing to His Softness
(which is Willie) to-night, and you needn't be surprised if some of you
are promoted or have your salaries doubled.
Yes, a reception by the staff on my return to the City would be
very appropriate. I think it would give tone to the paper.
1 ate half a can of oysters to-day. (Copyrighted.)
Something painful has just happened. An old fogy has been hang
ing around here for some time amusing himself by making unfeeling
remarks about the Examiner and the fight. 1 think he is in the pay of
the church cranks. Well, he got a crowd around him in the hotel and
began to talk of the old pugilists. They were the men who fought for
the glory of the thing, he said. They didn't sell themselves out to
the highest bidder. They didn't make the stage contemptible. .They
didn't spend their time with parasites and pluguglies, and when a man
placed his money on them he got an honest return.
All this the old crank growls out. Then he says: "What the
prize-fighters of to-day have done to the ring Hearst and his class are
doing to the press. Think of Horace Greeley and Charles Dickens and
Garfield and James G. Blame, who were newspaper men, writing for
a paper whose columns are polluted with the twaddle of pugilists and
the ranting of murderers. Think of it," he says, getting redder and
redder in the face. Then I'm blest if he didn't get the tongs from the
fire, and, taking the Examiner by the corner, as if he were taking a
dead cat by the tail, he heaved it into the gutter. It made my blood
boil.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to copyright the old man and then kill
him ?
I ate an orange to-night. (Exclusive.)
.1 see that you're not putting borders around my letters any more.
I am told that our type-setting machines won't make them and we have
to hire a man to do the work. Compositors are a costly crew, and if
we had fewer of them on the staff there' d be more money for me and
the other star writers. You needn't make any more borders.
I wet my feet this morning, but they're dry now. (Copyrighted.)
J. (Copyrighted) CORBETT.
P. S. â Don't limit the space of the lady writers, but give them
a hunch not to refer to themselves so often. The "I." in their
letters makes me think of peacocks' tails. JAY.
gave neither principal any advantage
over the other and were fair to both. He
accepted them in their entirety and prom
ised faithfully to live up to them through
out the fight.
Siler was getting along swimmingly.
Surely, thought he, tbe days of long
winded wrangles over rules and technical
ities among fighters had happily gone by.
Then he ran against "Fitz" and his
dream of love was over. The Cornishman
does not seem to be willing to vouchsafe
any reasons ln detail for his change of
front in regard to the clinch-hitting rule,
and Siler professes to be somewhat at sea
on the matter himself. But I think
George knows more than he was willing
divulge to-night.
He and Fitzsimmons have bad a talk
and the latter must have unbosomed him
self to at least some extent. The fact that
they agreed to meet again to-morrow and
talk the matter over once more undoubt
edly has something to do with Siler's
present reticence, for he may have hopes
that Fitzsimmons will withdraw his ob
jections and stand by the stereotyped
rules.
Now, this little story, when it becomes
public property, is certain to give rise to
rumors to the effect that "Fitz" is getting
frig htenefl, and many will be the knowing
, winks tbat will be exchanged. But I
would not advise anybody to take too
much stock in such a proposition. Fitz
simmons is too sly a fox to come out sin
cerely and confess that he fears Corbett in
any tactics or ring rules. Suppose he and
his friends wanted to curb the daily
growing tendency to- send Fitzsimmons
stock up in the betting, could a better
scheme be adopted for bearing the market
than by creating an impression that the
Cornishman is growing chicken-hearted?
The knowing ones who are going to risk
their money on Bob in this fight want to
get in on as short an end as possible, so as
to improve their chances for big win
nings. They do not bail with delight the
news from New York that there is a pre
ponderance there of Fitzsimons money,

for this is certain to affect the local market
and shoot the price on the Oftrnisbman up
to even money or better. It would not be
surprising if Julian engineered the scheme
to down brakes. They don't make them
any sharper or smarter than this band
some and smiling young brother-in-law
i and manager. He is familiar with all the
j curves in tbe sporting world and never yet
, boueht a gold brick. 09l
But Fitzsimmons' recalcitrance is not all
that is causing worry among the men who
are vitally interested in seeing the great
fight brought off without a jar. Dan
Stuart has not emerged from bis room
now for ten days, and I have it on the best
of authority to-night that be is a far
sicker man than the reports which have
issued from his chamber would indicate.
When he went to bed it was announced
! tnat the cause therefor was the return of
j an old abdominal complaint, and that be
| would be housed only lor a day or two,
but it turns out that Dan had an out-and
out attack of pneumonia as the result of
the sudden change of climate. The at
mosphere of Carson is extremely treacher
ous at this season of the year and nips a
tenderfoot entire. without warning.
Stuart weathered the attack nicely until
last night, when he bad a relapse. Sev
eral doctors were called in hurriedly, and
! for a time it looked as though the popular
j Texan would not survive to see the reali
zation of his scheme to pull off the great
est prize-fight of the century. But be la
the happy possessor of a constitution of
iron, and he finally beat off tbe clammy
band that sought to fasten itself on his
throat. To-day the doctors said be was
doing well and one? more out of danger.
If anything serious should happen to
Stuart there is no telling what would be
come of the prize-fight project. It would
be left on the hands of W. K. Wheelock
and Al Livingston.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1897.
THE MONITOR ON . THE FIGHT.
The State of Nevada has disgraced Itself by permitting two brutes to maul each
other in open day for the delectation of the pluguslies of half a continent. We of
California, must be confessed, have little reason to boast of our superior virtue.
Only a few months ago San Francisco permitted a similar encounter and judges, law
yers, business men, doctor*, sat down to witness a spectacle which degraded them be
low the level of the brutos who performed before them.
Emboldened by such distinguished patronage the prize-fighters have captured the
State of Nevada and have chosen the 17th day cf March as the date on which they will
fight like beasts for superiority, or what is more likely, will pretend to fight for a fraudu
lent decision and the plunder of the idiotic barbarians who bet upon them.
It is difficult to speak with moderation on this matter. Many of those promi
nent in the scandal bear Irish names. They are exploiting their nationality in this
town for the purpose of raising money. The other side is doing the samÂ». Devoid of
honor, devoid of decency, they would make profit out of the holiest feelings of hu
manity.
To put the seal on their infamy they have chosen to desecrate a festival sa
cred to the highest interests of tho Irish race. St. Patrick's day is to every man with
Celtic blood in him the symbol of faith. It tells of the glorious ideals and noble lives
of those who gave-themselves for the uplifting of his people and the evangelization of
the world. It is a day to be proud of, for it tells not of conquests by fire or swoid, but
of the triumphs of the soul and of victories of the word of God.
And now it ie to be degraded by the heroes of the shambles. It is. to be made
a holiday for men whose names stink in the nostrils of civilization. It is to be
celebrated by a congregation before whom convicts are gentlemen and Dahomeyan
savages lights of culture. '..*.- 1 ;..;' \ $_$*
If this thing had been done by tho enemies of our race and creed verily we
might have borne it; but it is done by those whose very names are a scandal and a
crying shame â names which' are the great, the sole argument against us tnat any
race should be responsible for such as they.
It is the bour.den duty of every man of Irish blood to move heaven and earth
that this stain be not laid to our charge. If there be individuals of the Celtic name
or societies of Irish people in the State of Nevada they will be disgraced forever if
they do not by word and deed strive their utmost to end this scandal. It maybe
impossible, but they can rid themselves of the responsibility by trying. Surely t! ere
must be some law and there can be found some courts that will interfere in behalf
of public morals. This insult should not,' must not be borne, and to the men of Ne
vada we look for relief.
The whole performance is a sordid piece of money-getting. The men who in this
City help to make that money-getting a -success are also responsible. We cannot
reach the touchs and- that crowd of professional pugs to whom this Is a colden
harvest. But it is possible to reach them indirectly. Even they are susceptible to
public opinion, and the opinion of all Irishmen and of all Irish societies on this
coast ought to be expressed decisively, emphatically and at onse. Let them at
least wash their hands of thi- outrage perpetrated by misbegotten hounds whose
lives are libels on the names tbey bear. â The Monitor.
is not in place yet, and tbis has bad the
effect of causing him to delay pitching
into the heaviest of his work.
"I am not afraid of losing too much time,"
said Fitzsimmons this afternoon. "You
see I am already in splendid fettle and do
not require such a long spell of training
now as would be the case had I put off
exercising until reaching Nevada. All I
need is to limber up and put a few finish
ing touches on my bellows."
The stomach trouble which upset the
Cornishman so seriously Sunday has en
tirely disappeared and he is now eating
voraciously. In fact, Host Cook says that
it has got down to be a race between Bob
and bis pet Great Dane Varum as to which
can stow away the most grub. Fitzsim
mons' work to-day consisted of a three
mile tramp over the snow-covered road
leading over the foothills south of the
ranch, a couple of glove bouts with D.in
Hickey end a spell of wrestling with
Ernest Roeber. Fitzsimmons goes to bed
at night with the chickens and is the first
one up in the morning. He is a sleeper
and be believes it is impossible for him to
get too much.
There was another arrival at the ranch
this morning in the person of a Chinese
chef, whom Julian unearthed in San
Francisco and brought with him. Fitz
simmons insisted upon having a chat
with the Celestial before he would accept
him into the household. First he wanted
to know if the cook was a highbinder.
"Yep, me Sam Yup man," leplied the
Chinaman, with an expansive grin.
"Sam Yup man, eh? Are the Sam Yups
all scrappers?" '"â¢ 'â "-"-..'-;7
--: "You bet."
"Well, that's all right then. This is a
scrapper's camp, you know." ' ; "> ;
Then, after Fitzsimmons got assur
ances from the newcomer that he could
cook rice and rats to the queen's taste, he
j formally installed him in the kitchen and
I proclaimed him the boss of that depart
j ment until St. Patrick's day.
Corbett continues to draw more visitors
| to his quarters than does Fitzsimmons.
| This is because of the superior condition
| of the road leading to Shaws Springs and
I the fact that it is a shorter trip than that
i out to Cook's rancn. "Pompadour" Jim
! put in seme heavy' licks during the day,
j wearing out all his trainers, but not once
j showing any signs of fatigue himself.
The manner in which Corbett is improv
ing as re aris his ability to endure work
| is really surprising. One can scarcely
i realize alter watching him as I did to-day
go through an hour and a half of the
fastest and most wearing kind of exercise
without even putting perceptibly, that be
is the same individual who so completely
collapsed in the ring not long a.o while
endeavoring to put Sharkey to sleep. He
puts in about twenty minutes with the
puts in about twenty minutes with the
j puncbing-bag, then plays handball with
Brother Joa until the latter is winded and
then Slogs Billy Woods until Woods cries
quits.
The bouts with Woods this afternoon
were unusually fast and furious. The
Denver man again had his head encased
j in a pneumatic mask and his chest pro
j tected by a baseball catcher's apron. The
| mask saves his jaw from some terrific
| smashes, but does not always guarantee
! to Billy a right to keep on his pins. One
j right-hand cro33 upset him beautifully to
j day and he did not hit a soft spot on the
j floor either. He was .taegercd twice by
left hooks on the chin, despite the protec
tion afforded by the mask. -
Corbett went through bis sprints twice
during the day, working two hours in the
morning and an hour and a half in tie
afternoon. This evening he came into
town and attended a performance of "All
the Comforts of Home," at the Opera
house. The play was given by some
clever Carson amateurs, and given in
j splendid style. Tho house was packed in
I anticipation of Corbett's coming, and his
I appearance was the signal for a great
j Durst of applause. A stage box had been
j handsomely decorated with American
! flags in his honor, and from this conspicu
j ous place he watched the performance.

CORBETI'S LATEST ACQUISITION.
Chicago Dentist Mill Assist in Training
â : 77. the Champion.
CARSON, Nj.v.. Feb. 23.â Tbe most at
tractive spot in Carson to-day was the
track, where a force of carpenters was
engaged in sorting out lumber for Stuart's
pavilion,. while crowds of shivering report
ers stood around in the snow and watched
operations.
March 12 is the date fixed by Architect
Donohoe for the completion of the struc
ture. Bad weather may set the work back
f r a few days, but liberal allowance has
been made for this. While drawing the
plans Donohoe bore in mind the possibil
ity of a heavy snowfall and the arena will
be so constructed that it can be cleared v.
snow in a few hours.
The seats will be more comfortable than
might be supposed at first observation,
and the graduations have been so nicely
calculated that nothing will obstruct the
view from even the cheapest chairs.
Governor Sadler asserts that be will
not occupy the box tendered to him by
Stuart.
"I will buy ray ticket just like any
other citizen." he insists. "I did only my
duty in signing tbe bill under which con
tests of this nature are permitted, and I
propose to contribute my share to the suc
cess of the first carnival. A number of
newspapers have begged me to be their
guest, but I want all to understand that I
will enter that arena as a private citizen."
Fitz occupied himself with hammer and
saw to-day." He designed and helped to
build a small rubdown-ro.^m off the mam
exercise ball, driving nails as neatly as he
fashions hor.eshoes. Roeber and Hickey
assisted in carrying around lumber and
patching up chinks through which cold
air crept in on the worker. .The outdoor
track also received some attention.
Martin Julian arrived this morning
from San Francisco with a noted Chinese
chef who carries about a French name.
The Mongol is said to be a marvel on
steaks and chops, and judging by his first
work-out this evening his ability has not
been overrated. He was photographed in
sixteen different poses in as many min
utes after his arrival.
Fitzsimmons' old sparring partner,
Jack Stelzner, will be here to-morrow to
assist the Cornishman. â¢
Owing v to McVey's continued illness
Corbett was not kept as busy to-day as he
wished. Dr. Pine, the robust Chicago
dentist who gave Corbett such, an argu
ment recently in the Windy City, will
reach Carson to-morrow afternoon and re
main at Shaws Springs until March 17.
Corbett will put on the mits with the
doctor every day and expects some lively
rallies. Jeffreys, the Los Angeles wonder
who stripped at 198 pounas in condition,
is also expected from San Francisco to
morrow. He will relieve Hilly Woods of
part of the heavy work and Corbett ex
pects to find in him a lively youngster.
George Green, whose match with â¢â¢Mys
terious" Bil.y Smith is now almost as
sured, may drop into the champion's
quarters any day. Stuart located Smith
this afternoon, and is now trying to con
vince the Boston welter-weight that he
has an opportunity to. earn $3000 on
March 16.
FITZSIMMONS IS A WALK.
That Is the Proph-oy Made by Dominick
i McCaffrey.
OMAHA, Nebb., Feb. 23.â Dominick Mc-
Caffrey, the old-time i ugilist, is spending
a few months on the ranch of his brother
at O'Neill, Nebr.
He is greatly interested in the approach
ing fight between Corbett and Fitzsim
mons, and in an interview to-day had tnis
to say :
"I look at it in this way: It is a great
boxer against a great fighter, and you
know there is a vast difference between
boxing and fighting.
"The fighter generally brings the money
home, all things considered. I feel sure
that Fitzsimmons will win if he gets fair
play. You know an individual cannot
beat any army; you also know how he
was treated in San Francisco,! Corbett
will be handled by smarter people than
will look after Fitzsimmons, and he is a
better business man all round, and is
more clever in boxing. On the other hand
there is no man alive whom Fitzsimmons
cannot hit, and when ho lands he makes
the desired impression. Corbett never got
hurt up to date, and when he does he will
forget his cleverness.
"It will certainly be the greatest fight
of the century. and the best chance to
make money. " I would back Fitzsimmons
to a standstill had I the money to do bo.
The case puts me in mind of my
fight with Sullivan to some extent.
I had the good will of tbe
country, but their position in the busi
ness and the social world would not
allow them to fight for my rights at tbe
ringside. Fitzsimmons is single-handed
and alone : and is, disliked. by the sports;
still with fair play he will win. That "is
my unbiased opinion." 7.7
McCaffrey has a pretty good idea of
fightnrs, and his declaration that Fitz
simmons' will land a winner at Carson
carried with it much weight in local
sporting circles. This* already shows it-

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 23.-The fol

Fitzsltntnons* Stock Rising.
BOSTON,- Mass., Feb. 23.â Although
there was little betting to-day on the Cor
bet t-Fitzsimmons fight, the Cornish man's
stock continues to rise. Several thousand
dollars was received to-day to place on
Fitzsimmons at the best odds obtainable.
At Gay's Hotel, the Columbia, Quincy
House and Clark's Fitzsimmons* money
can be had at 10 to 8. Jerry Sullivan
placed $15.0 to $125. to-day that Fitzsim

Vendig Jhrrnt'tts Trouble.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 23. â Dan
Stuart's $10,000, which is the balance of
tbe $15,000 purse, arrived to-day, although
"Al" Smith would not admit the -fact
directly, as he does not wish to have the
money attached by Joe Vendig's lawyers.
Vendig claims to be Stuart's partner,
but the latter has repudiated him.
Consequently, Vendig's lawyers pro
pose taking action in his behalf
in . the United States .7 courts : at
once, and sporting men 'are afraid
an attempt may be made to locate and
levy on the $15,000 purse money which is
supposed to be la the bands of the final
stakeholder. . They fear Vendig " : may
spring some big surprise 'in " a legal way
that will interfere with the fight.

PROGRESS OF THE
LEXOW INQUIRY
How the Price of Sugar Is
Regulated by the
Combine-
Explained by the President of
the Wholesale Grocers'
Association. .
American Tobacco Company's Presi
dent Tells cf th. Methods of
H.s Monopoly.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 23.â Tbe joint
jegislative committee investigating trusts,
etc., in this State resumed its hearing this
morning.
Waldo Smith, president of the Whole
sale Grocers' Association, said his associa
tion was not incorporated and extended
through New York, New Jersey, New
Hampshire and Vermont. To obtain ad
mission each member of a firm bad to pay
$10 a year. He denied that his associa
tion controlled the price of sugar in any
way. Tbe only thing the association did,
be said, was to send out a list of the prices
in sugar prepared by the secretary. The
grocers all over the country adopted the
prices of the American Refining Company
as the standard. Mr. Smith said nis firm
bought goods from the American Sugar
Refining Company and from the Moilen
hour Company.
"And you get the same discount from
both companies?"
"Yes. sir."
"Then the product of the Mollenhour
Company is fixed by the quoted prices of
the American Sugar Refining Company?"
Mr. Smith said he bad no knowledge of
any such thing. He said the Wholesale
Grocers' Association had asked the Amer
ican Sugar Refining Company for a rebate
which would prevent the cutting of prices.
In other words, tbey asked for protection
and tbe sugar company gave it to tbem.
Witness said that sugar was sold wherever
the grocers' organization existed at the
same price.
James R. Duke, president of the Amer
ican Tobacco Company, was the next wit
ness. He said the company was organ
ized in New Jersey because the laws there
were more favorable. ' There were five
companies organized into the American
Tobacco Companyâ Duke Sous & Co.,
Allen & Ginter, W. S. Kimball & Co.,
Kinney Tobacco Co. and Gordon & Co.
The companies were incorporated in 1890.
Nine concerns were taken in alter the or
ganization. No manufacturing was done
in New Jersey. Several factories bad been
closed, but tue witness could not say how
many people were thrown out of employ
ment, but said a great many were re-em
ployed.
"Do you operate under a factors' agree
ment?" " 77..V.-7V*-.. .7 f
"No, sir; we call ours a consignment
agreement." â :-':â¢ â â¢ -
â¢ A copy of this was produced and placed
in evidence. In reply to an other qu -ation
the witness Mid that the companies con
trolled from 80 to 90 per cent of the to
bacco trade.
"How many competing companies were
left at the tim - oi the organization?"
"About 100."
The witness said the agreement referred
to the sale of cigarettes. '
"Then you have this agreement with
wholesale grocers?"
'Yes, sir."
"Is it a fact that the greater number of
your consignees are wholesale grocers?"
"No, sir."
The witness said that if the consignees
violated any clause in t c agreement it
was withdrawn. The consignees are al
| lowed under the agreement a 2>_ per cent
commission and an additional % per cent
j if they handle the cigaret- es of tue Ameri
can Tobacco Company exclusively and if
they do not sell or in any way aid in the
sale or distribution of cigarettes of other
manufacturers.
"Then you compel the consignees to fix
a price?"
"Yt-s, sir." 77*77
"ls it not a fact that a man cannot do
business unless he handles your cigar
ettes?" .
"He can do business, but he cannot
make as much money." .
"Does not that state of things tend to
make a monopoly?"
'No. sir; for the simple reason that we
make and sell our own brands and any
other person can make bis own brands."
"Is it a fact that the small merchant
must take your brand in order to do busi
ness, and do you not by the creation of
the intermediate *system of rebates and
discounts practically secure for your
products a monopoly ?"
"No, sir. Take' another, brand which
the' public wants and another manufac
turer can supply the whole business."
Senator Lexow announced an adjourn
ment until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
TO OPEN INDIAN LANDS.
A Point of Order Leads to a Warm
'and Interesting Debate in
â  .. the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 23,âNo
tice was given by Morrill (R.) of Vermont
in the Senate to-day of his intention to
address the Senate on Thursday on
the resolution in reference to the inde
pendence of Cuba.
j After the routine morning business the
consideration of the Indian appropriation
bill was resumedâ the question being a
point of order-made yesterday by Vilas
(D.) of Wisconsin against the committee
amendment for 'apportionment of the Un
compahgre Indian reservation. The dis
cussion took a range beyond the parlia
mentary limit of order and extended to
the question of valuable deposits of gil
senite and asphaltum on the lands of tbe
reservation in Utah, which Vilas wanted
to have reserved by the Government.
His argument was replied to by Cannon
(R.) of Utah, who argued in favor of the
opening ot the reservation, which contains
over 2,000.000 acres of land. He said the
mineral lands were passing into the hands
of a corporation or monopoly.
At the close of nearly two hours' debate
I the point of order was submitted to the
Senate, which de.ided by a vote of 31 to -
16 that the amendment was in order. The
discussion went on as to the merits of the
amendment.
Pending the discussion . Mills (D.) of
Texas offered a resolution, which wÂ«v
agreed to, requesting the Prisident to}
transmit to the Senate a statement of th*
facts concerning the arrest, imprisonment
and death of Dr. Ricardo Ruiz in the jail
at Guanobacoa, Cuba, with copies of tbe
correspondence on the subject.
The Vice-President laid before. the Sen
ate a report from the Secretary of State as
to the persons claiming to be American
citizens who were captured on board thÂ»
Competitor. -Referred to the Committer
on Foreign Relations.
The discussion over the Uncompahgre
reservat on went on for a couple o! hours
Brown (R.) of Utah argued vehemently ii.
support of the amendment and In favor o:
opening- the reservation to the people.
Clark (R.) of Wyoming took the same po
sition.
Palmer (D.) of Illinois favored dispos
ing of the valuable gilsenite deposits by
public sale.
Jones (D.) of Arkansas assailed the hill
on account of its injustice to the Ute In
dians, whose reservation it was.
Vest (D.) of Missouri bitterly criticized
the administration, that all
me complications in the matter had re
sulted from the refu-al of the President
to execute the law. H
Vilas protested against what he called
the arraignment of the President by Vest.
"I arraign the President, if the Senator
so characterizes my remarks," said Vest,
"because I declare that he had no right to
disobey an act of Congress which was
mandatory upon him. If he believed
that we were was tine the substance of the
people, he should have called it to our
attention in a legislational way and asked
us to right the wrong. " instead of that, he
usurped legislative functions and declared
that he would not obey the act of Con
gress. These are the undisputed facts."
"So far from their being undisputed
facts," said Vilas, "I am astonished that
the Senator 1 from Missouri should make
such a statement."
Vilas then offered an amendment to thai
amendment providing for a survey of .the!
reservation, the mineral lots to be sub-"
divided into lots of suitable size and form
and a royalty or price per too to be fixed
for asphaltum, gils**nite and other min
erals, and that instead of a patent, a lease
shall issue for each of such lots for
twenty-five years, subject to the payment
of the royalty. .7*l
-, Brown (R.) of Utah opposed the amend
ment as overthrowing the settled and es
tablished mining laws of the country un
der which the man who first made bis
mining location staked out his claim.
Under the proposed amendment claims
were to be staked out by the Government
and disposed of by lease. In other re
spects the established mining laws of the
country were to be set aside and obliter
ated with one swetp, and the Government
was to "stand in as partner or as a land
lord." It was such a policy as that which
bad cost the life of one of the early Eng
lish Kings. 7 v
Vilas' amendment was rejected.
The committee amendment was modi
fied by one offered by Vest and agreed to.
Ayes 45, noes 15. It now reads:
That all of the Uncompahgre Indian reser
vation in tbe State of Utah except 10,000
acres ot bottom land extending about ten or
twelve miles up the White River on both sides
from its mouth is hereby declared open to
public entry under the laws of the United
States, provided that no person shall be al
lowed to make more than lour claims on lands
containing ijilsenite.
The bill was laid aside and Hoar (R.) of
Massachusetts offered a resolution pro
posing this form of certificate of election
of United States Senators:
To the President of the United States Senate:
This 1* to certify that on the day of
A. B. was duly elected by the Legislature of
the Stale ot a Senator from said State to
represent said Stat. In the Senate of the
United States for the term of fix years begin
ning on the fourth of March, 189â
The resolution went over . without
action. ... Â*.;.; * ' ''-. â .â¢ *_â¢--:
* The Senate on motion, of Smith (D. of
New Jersey and by an aye and noe vote of
34 to 26 at 5 o'clock proceeded to the con
sideration of executive business and short
ly thereafter adjourned until 11 a. m. to

Speeches to Be Limited to F.v
Minutes and an Urgency File
Created.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 23.â As the
result of the full review of the work of
the Legislature for the first fifty days of
the session, published in the Call this
morning, measures were taken to-day to
expedite business in the Senate. The
article in question acted as a decided
stimulant. But ten days of the sixty
fixed by statute for the session of the
Legislature are left, and even though thÂ«
time may be extenaed two weeks, the
showing made in the Call indicated that
many a measure was destined to die on
the files.
Senator Holloway started the movement
for greater activity. He introduced a
resolution providing for the creation of a
special urgency Me. Each Senator, in
alphabetical order, was to be allowed to
select bis most important measure each
day and place it on this file. The con
sideration ot these bills was to be the
business of the evening session, the meas
ures to be taken up alternately from the
top and bottom of the file.
Holloway's resolution provided for this
file being made up to- morrow, but he ac
cepted an amendment deferring such ac
tion until Monday. The author of the
resolution argued that this course would
bring all the best bills to the front, and
that business would be greatly expedited
thereby.
Bulla spoke against the proposition.
He said if the resolution were adopted the
general file would not again be reached at
this session. It would also, be declared,
result in bringing not the meritorious
measures to the head of the file, but those
which carry large appropriations, and
claim bills.
Considerably more debate followed, and
the resolution was defeated, but is likely
to be adopted later on, as many who voted
against it did so simply because they be
lieved it was too early in the session to
adopt such a measure.
Senator Voorheis came to the rescue
with a resolution providing that all
speeches be limited to five minutes here
after. Some "little opposition was mani
fested, but after being amended so as to
inaugurate tbe five-minute rule on Mon
day next, instead of at once, the resolu
tion was adopted.
Constitutional amendments, joint reso
lutions and all measures carrying appro
priations, according to Senate rules, must
be considered twelve days before adjourn-'
.ment sine die, and no action looking to
adjournment has yet been taken. The
date of final adjournment must be fixed
by a concurrent resolution, and at least
twelve days' notice of such adjournment
must be given.
Senator Smith will bring up the urgency
file question again to-morrow mornine.
and there is every indication that it will
then be settled in favor oi creating an
urgency bill.
It was conceded on all sides here that
The Call'- comprehensive resume of lee- j
-slative work was a valuable bit of enter
prise. Here are some of the expressions
relative to it:
Lieutenant-Governor Jeterâ lt is a his
tory of the work of the session. The idea
is a good one. It calls the attention of
the people directly to the work of the ses
sion and places it before them in a way
that I should think would be very benefi
cial to the people of the State and mem
bers of the Legislature. It showed the
latter the need of expediting matters.
The more the people can be "informed of
what goes on here the more nearly can
the members come to serving then, and
carrying out their wishes. lam satisfied
that that is tbe disposition of this Legis
lature.
Senator Smithâ The Call's resume of
legislative work is both interesting and
valuable. It show, in a concise form the
condition of all bills at the present time.
This will enable the people throughout the !
State to ascertain the status of bills in
which their sections are particularly in
terested, and aid tbem to prompt .tie
action of their representatives accordingly.
My greatest fear has been that the Legit.
lature might enact too many laws. This is
somewhat removed by the showing made
in The Call, from which I observe that
comparatively few bills are likely to reach
tinai passage. lam of the opinion that
within a day or two the Senate will begin
to conclude its labors.
Senator Voorheisâ lt is a very good
thine, as it presents the status of legisla
tion in a most intelligible manner, and
tnus furnishes valuable information to the
members, and mor.- particularly for their
const tuents who are not here. (
Senator Holloway â It gives an excellent
idea of tne progress that has been made
and what we have yet to do to get away in
a reasonable lime.
Senator Bulla â It is a valuable compila
tion of what has been done and places us
all under obligations. The way tilings are
rushed here none of us can tell just where
we are. and thi*- gives us exactly the infor
mation we need. I think we owe The Call
thanks in getting this up in such a com

TERRIBLE FLOODS IN THE EAST.
Great Loss of Life and Destruction of
Property in Ohio, Kentucky anil
Pen nsy Iran ia.
CINCINNATI. Ohio, Feb. 23.â The Ohio
River has been rising at the rate of 3
inches an hour since 11 a. m. At 9 o'clock
50 feet 3 inches was the stage. Reports
from all up-river points are that the heavy
rains of the past twenty-four hours have
left all tributaries overflowing banks and
Rending volumes into the Ohio.
Unless there is a sharp freeze to stiffen
the water-soaked ground it is estimated
by river men that a sixty-foot" stage is al
most certain. The great tobacco ware
houses in Front street are full of water to
tho first floor.
At 10 o'clock to-night all the cellars on
Arabella street,. Newport, from Southgate
' to Fourth street, were full of water and
many residents were preparing to move
'out- The Licking River has inundated
the Queen City Jockey Club property at
Wildt-rs station, the track being almost
covered with water.
Water in the pits at the Lick rolling
mill has caused a shut-down and 250
hands will be idle. The crops of the
market, gardeners at Cumminsville and
Mill Creek Valley are probably destroyed.
.At 11 o'clock to-night the water was
standing about five feet over the main
tracks entering the Grand Central railroad
depot, and a 1 of the passenger trains of
the following railroads abandoned the
depot:, Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern!
Ohio and Mississippi, Big Four and Queen
and Crescent. The Chesapeake and Ohio
and Louisville and Nashville, by reason of
their tracks being more elevated, will not
be reached in the depot under sixty feet.
The roads abandoning the Grand Central
have a temporary depot that will be used
until ihe water subsides.
A dispatch from Charleston, W. Va.,
says there is fully six feet of water in the
Capitol yard. Every newspaper in town
is submerged. The electric-light and gas
plants are bath under water. A bureau
for the relief of the flood sufferers has
been opened. The water is falling, but a
second rise is reported coming. Business
is suspended.
At Bristol, Term., this mornine, a flood
poured down the valley, and but for the
blowing of alarm whistles several families
would have perished. The damage to
property will be heavy.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 23.â Streams
in Kentucky are clear out of their banks
and doing immeasurable damage. Several
people bnve been drowned in various
parts of tbe State. Much stock has been
lost, fencing swept away and other prop
erty almost ruined.
News comes from Pineville, Ky., that
two white men while crossing a raginc
stream were drowned, and also a revenue
officer, who was in the mountains looking
after moonshiners. .7"
In Berry, Knott, Letcher and Breathitt
counties the flood is doing much damage.
Jameson, the county seat of tho latter
county, is partly under water.
At Middlesboro, a cloudburst deluged
the locality drowning James Charwell, his
wife and four children.
At Harrodsbure, near Dixville, the water
run over the bridge. E. Patterson and
wife attempted to cross. Mrs. Patterson
and the mule she was riding were carried
away. The woman caught the limbs of
a tree, half a mile down the stream.
The husband swam to her and got her
out of the limbs. Neighbors made a raft
and reached them. The water washed
Patterson off the raft. He was finally
rescued in an unconscious condition and
will die.
Reports from Jackson and other places
uo the north fork say there has been con
siderable loss of life and property.
Mrs. llutzelle and little daughter were
drowned in their house, which, was
washed from the mountainside in Breat
hitt County last night. Two men whose
names could. not be learned were drowned
in one of the streams in Bell County.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 23.-The Ohio
River has risen $% feet here since yester
day and it is still rising nt the rate of
three inches an hour. Two-thirds of the
town of Corbin is under water. The dam
age from the flood in southeastern Ken
tucky is $200.000. . Near Donkey Jonas
Tyree was caught in tbe Powell River and
drowned.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 23.â Floods con
tinue throughout this section. The rivers

district are submerged, and operations
are suspended.' .The situation is serious.
The loss in this city alone is $200,000.
ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY IME RAID.
j Rhodes Accuses President Kruger of
Breaking Mis Promises.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 23.â The examina
tion of Cecil Rhodes by a parliamentary
committee was resumed to-day. Several
times Rhodes attempted to justify the raid
by calling attention to the fact that Eng
land was now in full sympathy with the
Cretans in seeking to obtain their civil
rights, whereas it was Britons who sought
civil rights in the Transvaal. Rhodes
declared that President Kruger had
premised to grant popular rights, but had
failed to keep his promises.
STATE MINERALOGIST A. S. COOPER.

'From a photograph by Taber.J
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 23.â S. Cooper oi Santa Barbara is the latest recipient of the I
gifts within the power of the executive to bestow, he having been to-day appointed by
Governor Budd to the position of State Mineralogist, vice J.J. Crawford, term expired. The
office carries a salary of $3000 a rear, with a number of minor appointments, paying salaries
which range from $100 to $150 a month.
For over twenty years Cooper has been a resident of Santa Barbara. He was County
Surveyor for several terms, and has held municipal offices in the city of Santa Barbara. Last
year he was again elected to the City Council by a large majority, and was one of the few
successful Democrats in a Republican county. He was also a delegate to the Democratic State
Convention. - r
During the la* decide he has devoted his attention exclusively to the study and examina
tion of asphaltum and oil. For nearly a quarter of a century he has been collecting books and
other publications upon the subject of rfsphaltum, and to-day he has a library on this special
topic that is said to be the most complete of it* kind in the world. ,
As a long recognized authority and writer on asphaltum he is well known throughout Ihe
oil-bearing regions of Southern California. It mr.y naturally be expected that the oil industry
of this State, s* favorably mentioned during the past year as a future resource of great value,
will receive more attention than has heretofore been given to it.
Over thirty years ego Cooper, who, by the way, is not related to Elwood Cooper, the olive
oil maker of Santa Barbara, was the telegraph operator at Santa Crux. Messages were few In
those days and Cooper devised what was the original of the "line is busy; call again," so that
he might leave his office occasionally and enjoy, himielt with the other, habitues of the ocean
beach. â  \. , -
The new State mineralogist has the reputation of being a great story-teller and has many
select yarns credited to him. 7 77> ;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1897.
EIGHTEEN DAYS
MORE OF LIFE
Both Branches of the State
Legislature to Adjourn
March 13
Assemblyman San'ord Scores
Milimen Who Abuse Their
Employes. -
Not a Dissenting Voice to the Retire-
ment of Chief Crowley on
a Pension. .
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. When
will the Legislature adjourn? is a question
that is being anxiously asked by persons
j interested in the fate of the fifteen bun
i dred and odd bills now pending. The
Senate has passed a concurrent resolution
to adjourn without delay on March 4, and
that resolution is now before the Assem- I
bly Committee on Ways and Means. A
large number of Assemblymen were inter
viewed this morning by a Call correspon
dent and they said that while the subject
had not been formally discussed, the gen
eral opinion was that the final adjourn
ment should be taken on March 13 â four
i days before the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight
in Nevada.
As was announced exclusively in The
I Call this morning, Assemblyman Sanford
of Mendocino rose to a question of privi
lege in reply to the charges made by cer
tain residents of Mendocino County and
published in last Sunday's Call. His
statement was the same as that in to-day's
issue, but he added concerning W. P. Mc- ]
Faul, one of the protestants:
"Who is this W. P. McFaul? He is an
owner in the Hardy Creek Lumber Com
pany; be is the Assessor of Mendocino
County, and the experts found that he
was $5000 short in his accounts aDd his
bondsmen had to make it good. E. C. Will
iams, another of those protestants, was
for five years secretary and treasurer of
| the Mendocino Lumber Company."
Sanford was applaud d by the gallery
and halt the members of the Assembly
when he had concluded.
Assemblymen Ennis and Sims of Sacra
mento trembled in their cane-bottomed
thrones when Arnerich's Assembly bill
727 came up for consideration this even
ing. The bill is entitled:
An act entitled an act to form agricultural
districts, to provide for formation of agricul
tural associations therein, and for the man- i
agement and control of the name by the State, I
, and to repeal _li acts and parts of acts in con
> flict with this act.
It will be remembered tbat at the last !
session Governor Budd vetoed many ap- â¢
' propriations for agricultural district as- '
, sociations with the result that district !
fairs languished, and the fat bog, the i
I woolly sheep and the bloated pumpkin I
j wasted their sweetness on the irrigated I
i field. The pres nt bill was introduced on !
i be hal i of the agriculturists of this State j
who believe that under proper regulations ,
agricultural district associations and fairs
may be productive of much good. It oe- I
( creases the number of districts to thirty- :
" six and ' makes a Hew apportionment all
around. By request of the representa- I
tives from Sacramento that county was !
left out of the bill, the purpose being to j
leave Sacramento at liberty to ask for an j
appropriation for State fair purposes.
A country member, sniffing the air sus
piciously, asked for the reason of the
: omission of Sacramento County from the
! bill. Price of Sonoma, the implacable foe
| of the meadow lark, replied that Sacra
mento did not want an agricultural dis
trict appropriation.
Melick of Los Angeles informed the As
sembly that Sacramento did not ask for j
an appropriation for a district fair because i
she wanted to come in and ask for one for j
the State fair. - '"_* ;*. '
Belshaw of Contra Costa seemed to be
wrought up over the matter, and declared I
with much vehemence that two years ago
the country members had been bunkoed.
"The nigger in r this bill," he added,-"is
that Sacramento .wants to say 'we have
no district fair appropriation, \ and we
ought to have one for a State fair.' At the
last session the country, members were
hoodwinked into voting for the State
Fair appropriations when the Sacramento
members knew that the Governor was
going to veto those for the district fairs."
â :. Shanahan denied that any of the, dis
trict fair appropriations were used for
horseractng. On the contrary, such use
was prohibited -by law. All the money
appropriated went back to the farmers in
the way of premiums for fruit and the
like. He saw no reason why the House
should insist on Sacramento taking some
thing that she did not want.
. Mt-lick tbought that at this time, when
the people 1 were crying out for actual
economy, to appropriate a large sum of
money for such purposes among the dif
ferent counties was an extravagance that
sbould be stopped. District fairs were
productive of no good. "In Los Angeles
County," he continued, "we know tbat
we can raise better products than in any
other part of the. world, and we don't
need to bring them together."
Affairs were getting very warm about
that lime and Price moved that the bill be
referred to the Ways and Means Com
mittee with instructions to report an
amendment containing such amounts as
may be considered best for the several
agricultural districts.
It is expected that the Assembly will on
to-morrow evening proceed to consider
Melick's Assembly bill 654 regulating pub
lications by State officers and commis
sioners, common councils, boards of
writers or Supervisors in counties, cities,
cities and counties, or. towns; and Melick's
Assembly bill 655 on the law of libel,
allowing newspapers to justify by publish
ing a retraction of libelous statements
made without malice.
These bills are of more than ordinary
interest to newspaper publishers and the
public generally. No. 654 defines a news
paper of general circulation as a newspa
per which publishes general and local
news. It was passed at the. last session,
but the Governor vetoed it becouse it pro
vided that such a newspaper should con
tain news transmitted by telegraph. As
many of the country papers cannot afford
to pay for wired words the bill was objec
tionable to the Governor. The word "tel
egraphic" has b en omitted in the present
bill, but an effort is being made in the
j lobby in the interest of lawyers to insert
the word "legal. in the bill. Should this
i be done official advertising may be in-
I serted in law journals which by copying a
{ few items of foreign and local news irom
' the morning papers may claim to be
classed as newspapers of general circula
tion.
When Senate biil 32 came up for third
reading and final passage this afternoon
Dibble of San Francisco made an urgent
plea for its passage. He explained that
the object of the bill was to do away with
arbitrary assessments by Assessors
throughout the Stale, and enabling As
sessors to obtain statements from owners
| of real and personal property as to the
quantity and value of their assessable
property. Supervisors are prohibited from
changing assessments. "It will place on
the assessment roll," continued Mr. Dib
ole, "thirty or forty millions of properly
that has been escaping taxation for the
past twenty years."
The bill was carried before the Speaker
; had announced the result of the rollcall,
â  but several members- who bad come in
during the rollcall and who had voted
aye on Dibble's statement that it was a
bill to tax millionaires, changed their
I votes from aye to no when tbey saw
i on inspecting the file that Braunhart was
i the author. Malcolm, Cutter, Bettman,
I Belsbaw, Leavitt, North of Alameda,
! Arnerich, Robinson and Dennery were
i the first to change their votes. The bill
was refused final passage by 18 ayes and
39 noes.
Sports will be pleased to learn that the
Senate bills of Mahoney and Pedlar pro
hibiting glove contests were denied final
passage in the Assembly. The vote was
almost unanimous. Toland gave notice
of a motion to reconsider, but that's all
tbe good it will do him.
The vote finally passing Senate bill 13,
allowing Chief of Police Crowley to retire
on a pension, was a grand compliment to
the Chief. There were 54 ayes and no
noes. f â â â¢*:

H ghly Interesting Discussion of the
Spoils System on the F.oor
of the H:use.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 23â In the
House to-day Fischer (R.) of New York
nt.t-.ea unanimous consent for considera
tion of tbe bill to authorize the Secretary
of the Navy to appoint Lieutenant Robert
Piatt commander in the navy, and ex
plained why it was desirable that the bill
should be passed, he being the only officer
in the navy who could not without special
legislation be promoted. Objection was
made, however, and the bill failed for the
present.
HooKer (R.) of New York was no more
successful in his effort to pass a bill to
amend the river and harbor act of 1894, so
as to permit the completion of the last of
the series of reservoirs at the head of the
Mississippi River. Upon the statement
of Fletcher (R.) of Minnesota, he did not
think the failure to pass the bill would
result in preventing the completion of the
reservoirs.
Loud (R.) of California objected, saying
that so far as it was possible for him to do
so he intended to prevent further foolish
ness of the kind. \ ;
Tire House then went into committee of
the whole to further consider the naval
appropriation bill. 7
; Barrett (R. of Massachusetts offered
an amendment to the bill providing for
tbe construction of a drydock at the Bo
ton navy-yard not to cost more than a
million dollars, and appropriating $100,000
to begin the work. ;. ,-â *â¢-;
Barrett, commenting severely upon I
Navy Department views so far as they re
lated to lack of necessity, for additional
drydock systems at Boston, urged the
necessity and expediency alike of - provid
ing 'ample docking facilities.'- Without
them the navy would be a fleeting show,
fit for parades in time of peace, but for
nothing in war.
Doolittle (R.) of Washington, Tyler (D.)
of Virginia and Boutelle (R.) of Maine re
plied to Barrett.
â¢ Sulloway (R.) of New York made a
point of order against Barrett's mo
tion that it was new legislation, ln
his opinion Boston was the worst place on
the coast to build a drydock. If by any
accident or providence of God a naval ves
sel should be got into the drydock, the
only way it could be got out would bo to
take it apart, Â« hip the pieces to Ports
mouth, . put then, together and then
launch it upon the 63 feet of water that
whs there. [Laughter.]

[laughter] and after they bad dug out the
mud and blasted out the' rocks in the
harbor so as to make it safe for ordinary

he would unite with them in their efforts
to get a drydock.
Hilborn (R.) of California offered a sub
stitute provision authorizing the Secretary
of the Navy to appoint a board of compe
tent officers to take the whole subject of
drydocks into consideration and report.
The substitute was rejected and Barrett's
amendment was defeated. * <-.-
After some further, debate the bill was
reported to the Honse without amend
ment and passed without a division.
The House entered again upon an era
of requests for consideration of bills by
unanimous consent, and under such con
sents several minor bills were passed.
. The first bill presented provoked an em
phatic and formal arraignment of the
course of patronage upon Congressional
service by Baily (D.) of Texas. It came
from the Committee on Jullciary, re
ported by Broderick (R.) of Kansas, and.
offered to amend section, 1815, revised
statutes*, to give the Governors of . Territo
ries power to remove appointees by them
selves or their predecessors. It was advo
cated by Murphy (R.) of Arizona, who ex
plained the desirability of the proposed
change.
Bailey (D.) of Texas, a member of the
Committee on Judiciary, opposed the bill,
saying it was a partisan one and that it
was one to enable the Governor of Arizona
soon to be appointed by the incoming Re
publican administration to remove Demo
cratic officials who under the law are en
titled to serve two years longer and put in
Republicans. 7.; â ;_
Catron (R.) of New Mexico favored the
passage of the bill as did Flynn (R.) of
Oklahoma, who asked that the Republi
cans be treated as they had treated the
Democrats under like conditions.
"lam," he said, "in favor of wiping out
the civil-service laws and filling every
office with Republicans." [Applause.]
Grosvenor (R. of Ohio aid not seem to
think that the Governors of the Terri
tories were entitled to any more power in
making appointments than Presidents of
the United States, and yet, be said, under
the civil-service law in -its. development
the President- could not take his sten
ographer, his typewriter or even a messen
ger into the White House with him with
out tne consent of this bureau, which had
usurped all functions of the Government.
j "I am in favor of the bill, however," he
said, "because I believe it to be a step in
tbe right direction. There is a tide rising
in t. is country which will sweep this
bureaucracy from power. The young men
propose to nave something to say and to
do about their country." [Applause.]
Grosvenor's assertion about the power
of the President to appoint employes to
offices in the White House had been made
in connection with statements about other
officials, who, he asserted, were also de
prived â¢of th power of selecting even
their confidential clerks or cashiers.
He was responded to vigorously by Bro
sius (R. ) of Pennsylvania, chairman of the 1
Committee on Civil Service Reform, who '
said tliat the merit system was the best
one by which young men could gain ad
mission into the public service. -."It saved
them the humiliation of. becoming beggars
at the ieet of bosses who are supposed to
have these favors to grant. They were
saved the degradation of becoming the
servile tools of politicians."
There was no objection, Brosius contin
ued, to the application of the merit system
in re ulating admission to the public ser
vice, but the scandal of the spoils system
continued inside of the service, and if pro
motions could be made to depend upon
merit alone there would bo no objection to
the system on the part of any one.
Bailey, resuming the floor, proceeded to
refer to the declarations of the Republican
party upon the subject of civil service re
form, when he was interrupted by Steele
(R.) of Indiana, who asked: "But what do
you think of it yourself
Bailey (impressively) l think it is a
humbug, sir.
Faria (R.) of . Indianaâ Why didn't you
repeal the law, then. .
Bailey Ãecause we did not have sense
enough.'' I think we will know better next
time. [Laughter.] : ',:_..-;

how enjoyable it may be in the abstract. A

Closes.
Forty Small Sailing Craft Test
â¢ ' Their Speed in a Light
Breeze.
Oarsmen From the Men-of-War Make
Fast Tim-; in Exciting
Competition. *
'. SAN DIEGO; Cai.., Feb. 23.-With a
1 igbt southeast wind blowing, forty yachts,
stoops, catboats, sharpies and fishing
boats crossed the line between the Phila
delphia and the Santa Fe wharf at 2 o'clock
this afternoon. â¢ , I - Â« ,
Five minutes previous a six-pounder
fired from the prow of the Philadelphia
gave' the signal to line up, and as Judge
Frank Sargent fired the pistol they passed
up the bay like a troop of white chariot \
racers.
Before the close of the race the wind
had veered around to the northwest and
developed into a twelve-knot breeze which
brought all the boats home a-spinninc.
The winners in the various classes,
the time not given, were: Sloops â
First, Angeline, N. D. Nichols, skipper;
.econd, Grade, Alexander Williamson.
Catboatsâ First, Nellie Adell ; second,
Volunteer. Sharpies â First, Louise,
Lew B. Harris; second, Jennie 8., Mitch
ell Brazier.
Fisbingboatsâ First, St. Joseph; second,
.Champion.
While the yacht races were in progress
the warship's' boat races were started.
The first event called was the twelve-oar
cutter race, participated in by crews from
* the United States ships Marion, Monterey
and Philadelphia.
ln rounding the first stakeboat all three
boats came together in a bad mix-up,
from which thÂ« Philadelphia boys first
succeeded in extricating themselves.
The Marion crew won, however, in the
remarkable time of 17:51 over a course of
three miles. Because of the foul the judges
refused to award the prize.
The next race was the six-oar eig con
test, participated in by crews from all
three warships as well as the Naval lie
serves.
The race was very exciting throughout j
and all Nthe crews showed remarkable en
durance. To the surprise of nearly every
one the Corwin crew came in first. Time,
15:06%. This is believed to beat the coast
record for six -oared gigs.
, In the ten-oar cutter race tho crew of
the Comus showed on time and. no others
appearing, the Britishers rowed over the j
three-mile course without a pacemaker in
the magnificent time of 17:59"^.
The race between the ship's cutters un- \
der sail was won by the Monadnock over I
a course of two and a half miles in 29:201 |
. The carnival committee closed its labors '<
to-night with all bills paid and several I
hundred dollars in the treasury. A large I
number of visitors have left the city, al- i
though several thousand remain.
SALINAS MOTHER'S GRIEF.
Crazed by Loneliness After Her Sons Had
Left Her to Seek Their '
Fortune.
SALINAS, Cal., Feb. 23.â The surpass- i
. ing strength of a mother's love was seen i
forcibly yesterday morning when Mrs. E. â 
. Souza, a woman about 50 years of age and
" "long a resident of Salinas, was found wan- ',
dering about the streets of the town intent }
upon a search for her children, whom she j
believed to be lost. The case is an un- |
usually sad one and is exciting the deep- I
est sympathy.
Many years ago Mr?. Souza came to
Salinas with her husband and here all of I
ber children were born and reared. In
time most of them married and left home, i
"and only three young men remained with i
their mother. These sons purchased a '
ranch in the Cachaqua, near Jamesburg, j
and they, with Mrs. Souza, lived upon it '
. till about three years ago. when two, of the
sons moved to San Frnncisco, where they
engaged in business. 'While in San Fran- '
cisco one of them (Claude) died aud bis
body was brought home for burial. The j
shock of this death seemed to affect tbe
old mother to a degree from which she' â¢
could not rally and she grew gradually ;
nervous, morose and disheartened. The !
culminating jioint of her sadness was
reached about a fortnight ago, when the j
last son who hat remained with her joined
his brother in Sin Fiancisco and she was
entirely alone. _,
Last Friday she received word from her
boys to come to them in San Francisco,
and she hastened to Salinas, intending to
start for Sa_t" Francisco yesterday morn
ing. She stopped at the home of Mrs.
. Starrs, a friend who lived near the San
Juan road, and retired at night with her
thoughts so firmly fixed upon her journey
and her children tbat this very intentness
of purpose must have unbalanced her
mind, already weakened by constant
broodings over her loneliness. When Miss
Starrs, who was to accompany her as far
as Castroville, went to her. room at 6
o'clock yesterday morning to awaken her
Mrs. Souza bad disappeared. A search <
was immediately begun and about 7 o'ciock
Constable Allen found ber wandering aim
lessly about and took her temporarily to
the home of Mrs. R. Vierras, where a phy
sician was called and soothing medicine
given to the distracted woman. The doc
tor said that Mrs. Souza was suffering
from severe nervous prostration, and if
her sons did not come to relieve her mind
at once by their presence she would have
to be taken to an asylum. The sons were
telephoned for as soon as their mother j
was found, but since the message was sent
to them Mrs. pSonza has grown rapidly I
worse and has become so violent that Con
stable Allen found it necessary to swear I
out a warrant for her examination for in- i
sanity.

stocks of such articles as we produce are
now very low and prices are likely to be
good for onr next crop, which promises to
be a large one. Then we are likely to have
the tariff matter settled in a short time.
President McKinley will call an extra ses
sion of Congress, to meet March \5, and
everything else in the way of legislation
will be subordinated to the enactment of a
tariff act. I believe that it will be passed
in time to take effect at the commence
ment of *he next Government fiscal yearâ
that is, July 1. Tbat will bring assurance
of a axed tariff for years to come,
sufficiently large to meet the expenses of
the Government, and so adjusted as to
provide, considerable protection to Ameri

and industrial conditions in every direc

FRESNO'S DEAD BURGLAR.
The Man Killed by Dsputy Sheriff Tim
mins Not the Notorious Outlaw
Muldoon.
. FRESNO, Cm.., Feb. 23.â The killing of
James Denman by Deputy Sheriff Tim
mins in the Courthouse Park last night
while Denman was attempting to escape
from the officer, who was taking him to
jail, bas been the subject of street discus
sion to-day. 7 7
Coroner Long .held an inquest on the
! body and the jury exonerated the Dep-
I uty Sheriff, who performed his duty under
j the law in shooting the man.
It has developed, however, that Denman
was not the Kings County horsethief
whom Timmins supposed lie was. The
name of tbe notorious thief is Muldoon,
and he is still at large.
But when Timtuin.s arrested Denman
he knew that his prisoner was guilty of
burglary in a residence in tbis city a few
days ago, besides suspecting him of being
Muldoon.
It was established to-day that Denman
entered the house of William Hogan in
the northern part of the city, and persons
who bad seen him emerge from th. house
identified the body to-day as that of the
burglar.
Though not the horse-thief for whom
the officers are so diligently looking, Den
man is Known to have been a law-breaker,
by wnose riddance the community is
much benefited.
Having arrested the man on a felony
I chars*, that of burglary, Deputy Sheriff
I Timmins was justified under the law in
shooting D->nman when the prisoner tried
to eÂ«.cat)e. No one is censuring the Deputy

Thornton will leave Santa Fe to-morrow
for Washington. He will go to answer the
charges which have been made that be is
prejudiced against the two assassins who
were to have been hanged to-day had not
Cleveland interfered. Governor Thornton
is considerably wrought up over the at
tempt to set aside the sentence of
death. He believes that the President has
been imposed upon, and for this reason
be considers tbat a personal interview will
be of more effect than any amount of
correspondence. Then too, in this par
ticular case, there are things which, the
Governor has been advised, had better be
spoken than written.
' When Governor Thornton reaches
Washington," one of his nearest friends
stated to-day, "he can tell the President
some things about this case which will
make him open his eyes." SESP
"Everybody in Santa Fe knows and has
known tbem, but in Washington it is
different."
"Should the men go to the gallows, it is
asserted, tbuv will make some sensational

President Hargrav. < Explains the
Obj ct for Which the College 7
Was Pnj;cted
SAN DIEGO, Cai^, Feb. 23.â Tuesday,
February 23, 1897, will ever remain a great
day in the history of theosophy. For on '
this day, let it be told, in tue park jof 135
acres recently purchased â¢". by the
theosophists on the northern end of Point
liOma, was laid the corner-stone of the
temple which is to be built and dedicated
to "the revival of tbe lost mysteries of
antiquity." * ' ; * ' *
The ceremonies were announced to take
place at 2 o'clock, but as early as 9 o'clock
this morning carriages were wending
their way along the road leading to
Point Loma.
Every available wheeled vehicle In the
city has been chartered. By 10 o'clock a
stream of people was pouring toward
Point Lomaâ bicyclists, equestrians, men
and women in carriages, road wagons, om
nibuses aud tally-hos.
The site of the proposed college, or
school as it is called, is a beautiful one
located on the heights on the ocean side
of the point, nearly opposite Rose ville
and overlooking the mighty Pacific to the
west.
To the north and east as far as the eye
can rea< h is a chain of mountains and
bills which stretch away southward into
Mexico, while almost at one's feet reposes
tne perfect bay of San Diego, its shore
bordered by tue cities of San Diego, Coro
nado and National City.
On reaching the spot the spectators
found every arrangement made for their
comfort and convenience. Seats were ar
ranged in amphitheater style, giving all a
front view of the enclosure containing
the cornerstone, the cap of which was
held in place by a derrick, from the top of
which were gracefully suspended, on ropes
stretching to the ground, the Sags of all
nations.
Over the entrance to the inclosure was
a large arch of evergreens supporting a
banner of yellow silk, upon which was
worked in purple silk the motto of the
order, "Truth, Light, Liberation for Dis
couraged Humanity."
Near the inclosure was pitched a small
closed tent, which none but the initiated
were allowed to enter.
At 2:30 o'clock the participants in the
ceremonies, twelve in number, came out
of the tent, each carrying some symbol
whose meaning was afterward explained
to the company. 7.
Then, standing by the cornerstone,
with Mr-. Tingley by his side and the
others ranged in parallel lines at right
angles to each other, President E. T. Har
grove of the societies in America, Europe
and Australasia, spoke on the objects of
the school. â¢â¢' 77-T, ':. ; .",..'.â. ,
The cap of the cornerstone,* which- is
not really a cornerstone, but a block of
San Diego granite, highly polished on its
face, was then lifted, disclosing. a com
panion stone having an orifice for the re
ceptacle of a tin box in its center.
This cap cornerstone, which is engraved
on its face with the initials of the school
and its date, is inlaid in the center with a
piece of Egyptian onyx taken from the
Temple of the Sphinx, and which was
presented to the crusaders by a sheik of
the Bedouins of tbat neighborhood.
The \ stone is designed to be subse
quently removed from its position and
placed in the center of the marble floor of
the main hall of the temple.
Advancing to tbe stone Mrs. Katherin
A. Tingley, who is tbe directress of the
school and the leader of the theosophical
movement in the world, placed within
the receptacle a square tin box contain
ing a history of the movement, "Best
Thoughts of Crusaders" and various par
chments.
The capstone was then lowered and
formally dedicated impressively. Mrs.
Tingley said:
"I dedicate this stone, a perfect square,
a fitting emblem of the perfect work to be
di.ne in the temple for the good of
humanity and the glory of the ancient
sage-?." v
Corn, oil ami wine were brought in order
by the participants and sprinkled by the
directress upon the stone. .These were fol
lowed by earth, emblem of man's body;
broken bottle of air, emblem of man's
breath; water, emblem of man's inner
self, and fire, emblem of man's spiritual
power.
"May these tires be lighted and may

offered. B*JÂ£-ft3BÂ£-lÃl_--
Rev. W. Williams of England then
read a portion of Christ's sermon on
tbe mount from the orthodox Bible,
following which quotations appropriate
to the occasion were recite 1 from Hindoo
scriptures, St. Paul, Hennez, the Bible,
Chinese sages, Confucius, Emerson, the
Persian Bible, Buddhist scriptures, etc.
Following a reading by Miss Anna
,'â  ' "
Brvce and Mrs. Claude Falls Wright on
"Harmony," Mrs. Tingley spoke of the
great significance of the occasion,
claiming: that the rites performed
were similar to those of ancient times
when the scholars of the world gathered
to found temples of learning, which they
regarded as a benefit to humanity.
"The school." she said, "will be inter
national in character, but American
In center; a light to lighten
the dark places of earth. Children
will be taught the material rules of
physical,' mental and spiritual life, and
how to gain strength to use them for the
blessing of the entire world." *
After some Hindu chanting, followed
by the ringing of .gold* bells and more
cabalistic siens, â¢ the American fla*
was lowered from the flagstaff and the
theosophicai flag, consisting of seven pur
ple stripes and six yellow ones', with a
yellow wreath enclosing a yellow star on
purple ground, was raised aloft.-? 7
The exercises then closed with ; a num

President Hargrove, in the course of his

CLOVERDALE' S GUESTS DEPART.
Citrus Pair Just Closed Was One â¢ of the
,â¢7 * Most Successful Held in the
State.- â -; ';â¢ .^7
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Feb. 23.â The ex
citement of the fair being over, the town
and tbe people have gradually relapsed
into their normal condition. This has been
the most successful fair ever held in Clo
verdale, which has now come to be looked
upon as the exposition city of northern
Sonoma valley. Altogether about 5000
people visited the fair. It has been the
one thing that has done the citrus in
terests ot the valley the most good. Clo
verdale got the biggest crown this year
tnat ever came up the valley. Santa Rosa
is vigilant. She is already talking about
getting up some kind of a fruit fair this
year, but it will not be an orange and
lemon show.
One of the handsomest glass cabinets in
the pavilion was tilled with hand-painted
china. It was the work of Mrs. W. E
Doty who, on plates, vase*, cups and
saucers and otner useful and ornamental
table ware, painted designs that are not
only lovely, but show a high order of ar
tistic talent. This cabinet of Mrs. Doty's
was one of the most admired exhibits of
the fair.
A man who worked early and late for
the success of the fair was G. B. Wilson,
its superintendent. Mr. Wilson saw that
all visitors felt at home, and -he did not
neglect to impress on visitors of note the
full significance of the citrus exhibits with
relation to tbe horticultural possibilities of
the northern section of the county.
Michael Menihan, proprietor of the big
hotel of Cloverdale, sen. down a generous
sample of oranges and .emous to-day to
the San Francisco Board of Trade for ex
hibition. He has one of the largest or
chards in the connty.
. Yesterday was the greatest, though the
last, day of the fair. The weather was
perfect. The sunshine which spread over
the valley was as golden as the oranges.
. Visitors arrived on every train, but the
great crowd came on Ide immense excur
sion train from Petaluma, Santa Rosa and
Healdsburg. There were twelve
coaches, each crowded, and by ac
tual count there were 745 persons aboard.
The Windsor band assisted Healdsburg
in making her section of the excursion a
success. Nearly half thepeop.e were from 1
Healdsburg. A delegation .rom that en
terprising city, headed by the Windsor
band, marched up town, followed by a
procession, which extended from the sta
tion to , the. pavilion, a distance of four
blocks. It seemed that the population of
the entire valley had gathered to celebrate
Washington's birthday by attending the
citrus lair. .
The pavilion was scarcely able to accom
modate the crowd. Hundreds of people
drove in from the ranches and vineyards
and wineries for a distance of twenty
miles around, and altogether about 3000
people saw the fair. ;'â¢ ..
The Windsor band delighted the specta
tors with several selections during the
alternoon. At night the electric lights
were operated in full blast the first lime
during the fair.
Many huge lamps were also used, and
the illumination of tbe scene was not only
brilliant but dazzling. The Cloverdale
brass band, under the leadership of Pro
fessor D. C. Smith, rendered a programme
of special selections, and Miss Mabel
Smith, the musician's daughter, played a
number of cornet solos.
E. W. Davis, County Superintendent of
Scnools and ex-president of the State
Grange, made a brief speech in the pavil
ion. His remarks were to the effect that It
was encouraging that such fruit could be
grown, encouraging to see it and encour
aging to note the friendly and neighborly
feeling betwee.i the cities of the valley.
The prizes on wines were awarded as
follows: Sweet wines, Cloverdale Wine
Company; dry red wines, Paricer Vine
yard Company; dry white wines, F.
Alueriz. _P?_H
The pavilion closed at 11 o'clock
and the citrus fair 6.' 1897. which has been
a great success in every way, ended with
a ball in Union Hail.* â¢â¢ .'.'

Â»
Prominent Citiz ns Vie With One
Another to Pay Tribute to the
Distinguished Judge.
Two hundred and fifty prominent citi
<-ens from representative walks of life,
Vsnd from all parts of Northern California,
assembled at the Palace Hotel last night
to tender a farewell banquet to Hon.
Joseph McKenna, who is soon to dep.rt
â¢for Washington to accept a Cabinet posi
tion.
The menu was elaborate and the toasts
. were many and eloquent. Colonel J. P.
Jackson was toastmas'.cr. To his left sat |
: Governor Budd, to his right the'gueatof
honor, and by his side Hon. James D.
â¢â¢. Phelan, Mayor.
Colonel Jackson's introductory speech
: was a happy effort and, like nearly every
r speech that followed, was applauded with
â â¢â¢vigor. He said it was a matter of con- !
â  : gratulation that the time had arrived
:* -when party names in California had lost
their meaning.
* . ."It is seldom given to any man," he
'said, "to succeed in the three branches of
:â¢ Government, but our honored guest bas j
.. 'been a splendid legislator, a good Judge |
and now is time comes to show that he \
' cart .succeed in the executive branch of 1
'â¢'.'.government. Judge McKenna assumed j
â¢â¢ : he woolsack a pute man and he will leave \
"'the ermine unstained." [Great applause.] !
:â¢ There were then loud cries for Judge !
â¢'McKenna and he arose and made a simple |
'.and. eloquent speech which brought great )
and prolonged applause. Among other !
'thing, he said:
"Mr. President and Gentlemen: I do j
..not know what to say. In our meager i
â¢" language a simple 'Thank you' is about
'A\i that is left. How to make a fitting re- |
turn 'for this tribute, this assemblage of;
-./representative men, I do not know. la.ree, ;
". however, with a brother Judge who wrote
: me a complimentary letter recently that
if my friends have anything to say they '
ought to say it while I Jive. Yet, stand- i
' ing here, confounded by your excessive :
â¢ kindness, I am inclined to think the dead i .
â¢ man has some advantages. [Laughter.] : 1
l!;e lead man may blush unseen and he \ -
{'4* vp t- 'expected to respond. '
17 '-'I take this, however, as a tribute to j ,
your representative rather than to the in- |
dividual. In that sense I can accept the ', '
honor without a feeling of unworthiness. \
Strictly speaking, however, a Cabinet offi- | '
â  cer is not a representative of a State, '
though his appointment may be an honor .
â¢to a State. Setting aside my own con
nection with the matter, 1 may I
in that sense rejoice that aI â¢
California^ is in the Cabinet, If '.
the right man has been selected, be ought . i
to give some tone and direction to affairs l
by reason of his coming out of the West. j
I -say this because I love my State and I i
dare to compare it with anything. j
"I love California in its sheer physical "I ',
beauty and genial climate; I love it in its j '
higher sensibility, in its birth, its life and
action.
"The State was born full grown, having j
no territorial history. I love its legends,
its romances and its history, and I love
its example of noble sacrifice, great '.
achievement and energy, a dashing pio
neer -spirit that subdued the wilderness ]
ana made it hum with the glories of a new ,
and splendid civilization.
"I shall go into the Cabinet a Califor- ,
nian [cheers], and that shall be my hi_rh- ]
.est title; I "shall go as the first Califor- ,
nian, that my admonition. I shall be sue- ,
ci c led by abler men, but by none whp co ,
with better intentions to do'what is right. 1 ,
shall say farewell in sadness, although it j
be but for a time and does not sever rela- .
tions, 1 leave with the assurance that this ,
n ght-'s kindness shall never be forgotten, ,
. and in the hope that my services in the ,
new field will justify and deserve the Kind- ,
.. .ness you have fcestowed." '
At -the conclusion of the speech Gov- ,
ernor Budd arose and proposed three I _
cheers for the pride of California, and they <
â¢ weie given with vim. _
Chief Justice Beatty responded briefly ,
..-to a toast on the judiciary, stating that J ,
â¢the relations of the Supreme Court with .
".Judge Mr-Kenna had always been pleas- _
ant. He . thought it ought to j
. please Caiifornians beyond measure .
Abac so fine and able a man had been se
lected 10 the Cabinet. "He will be found ,
l^onest, faithful and always equal to the
'^â¢-charge of duties and the solution of
..difficulties," said the Judge amid a tumult
, of applause.
Thomas J. Clunie was down for re
sponse to a toast named' "The President
.of the United States." He gracefully de
r clined to speak of Cleveland, but devoted
ten minutes to a review of Judge Mc-
Kenna's career as he knew it.
*". *"I have! known him for nearly a
â¢ quarter, of a century," he said, "and he
' has always been a leader. It was nearly
twenty-two years ago that I found him a
-leader 'of his â¢ party in tbe Assem
bly of ' this State, and when I
served with him in Congress many
â¢ years later I found him recognized as a
.thinker and worker by such men as Blame
and McKinley. As a Democrat I con
gratulate McKinley on his selection from
this State, and ii ought to be the hope of
â¢ all honest citizens that the incoming ad
. ministration will be a success."
' Hon. M. M. Estee spoke briefly, follow
".ing Mr. Clunie. He said he thought the
new President had begun exceedingly well
'">' appointing Judge McKenna. "There
" were about a thousand candidates for the
tjesition," he said, "but McKinley ap
. ..Pointed ihe best one of all. Let us give
' the President and the appointee our con
fidence and the hope that the administra
tion will be a success."
"The State of California" was to have
been responded to by Governor Budd, but
â¢ he pleaded that pressing business had
prevented due preparation, so George A.
K"iÂ«rht responded. He spoke of the fer
. Uilisyand extent of the State, and hoped
<J 'at Judge McKenna's accession to the
jalnnet was but the beginning of a
*.jor:ous ran to be played in National his- ?
tory by Caiifornians. -. â 
Attorney-General Frzgcrald followed in .
. an eloquent tribute to the judiciary and
the guest of the' evening. He said: "It
is the judees who declare what the law is
and clearly define it. All honor to them
and to our gnest of honor, who has helped
to keep the ermine pure. We congratu
late President-elect McKiniev because ne
has selected a representative" citizen Irom -

JUDGE McKENNA Welcomed by His Distinguished Hosts to the Complimentary Banquet Held
Last Night at the Palace HoteL \
our ranks to fill an important position. '
John P. Irish was cheered when he was
announced to speak on "The Cabinet in
Relation to Politic*." He cade a happy
speech, concluding that the Cabinet was
not a political position. He rejoiced that
California had a citizen as a representa
tive in that position, which is peculiarly
j representative to the great nations of the
i earth.
Mayor Pnelan acknowledged the toast
"San" Francisco, the Queen City." He felt
sure, he said, that the ftttute of San Fran
cisco, in spite of hard times jind adverse
legislation, was absolutely safe and could
j not be turned aside from the pathway of
I prosperity. But without the energy, en
j terpr se and industry of civilized men,
i mere physical qualifications were as
; nothing. Daniel Webster .'ad said
! that California would become an
I independent empire, owins to its remote
i situation and its inherent resources. l.'iis,
I he thought, was a strange sentiment for so
great a man, and yet that attitude was
j typical of a former generation. It was un
| fortunately true that this great city had
| not received due recognition in view of
â  the vast amount of wealth it had contrib
! uted to the Federal exchequer in the past.
I It was only so late as the present week
I Mat their honored citizen, Joseph Mc
! Kenna, had been called to the councils uf
the Nation, and for tbis consideration
| they were truly thankful. Judce Mr-
Kenna, the speaker said, bad changed the j
slogan from onward to upward, it beln? j
no longer possible to extend tbe empire of
the State any further westward.
Samuel M. Shortridge, replying to the
toast of "The Army and .â Navy," said:
"Being unmarried, what do I know of ,
War? [Lau_hter.J Standing in the pres- j
ence ol Hannibal, represented by my
friend, General Barnes, . yonder, how j
shall 1 sp"*ak of war? Standing
i ere in the presence of so many j
distinguished men, whose sabers have I
flashed on battle-fields, or whose words of ]
command have echoed over the waters ;
from the decks of victorious vessels, I ,
feel that of all subjects none could !
have been selected about whicn I know
less, and therefore about which I
am able lo speak more. [Liugbter.]
This seems to me to be an era
of good feeling. The administration of
Monroe has returned to us. When I see
here assembled the Governor of the State,
for whose defeat I spoke so much, traveled
so far, and upon his left-hand there is
Attorney-General Fitzgerald, and re
member tbe engagements in which
I have gone down before his
trusty sword, I feel that after all
I am in tbe house of ray friend*.
For it l-> the pride and glory of American
citizenship â it is the pride and glory of
American patriotism â that above the
clouds, the dust of the arena, above the
turmoil of tbe battlefield, above, prejudice
and passion, which warn the judgment
and sometimes chill the sympathies of the
heart, there is the fla^ of our coun
try, which has been held aloft in
victory by the army and navy of the ciun
try. [Applause.] And from the revolu
tionary period, from the hour of Wash
ington, ftom the War of '1812 and the j
matchless and immortal victories of Jack
son, in the Mexican War and the victories
there, and in the unhappy, the direful, the
ever-to-be-regretted struggle of 1860, 18-51
and onward â in every place, whether it be
on land or on sea, whether the blood of
our soldiers has reddened the grass of the I
meadow or crimsoned the waves of the
ocean, the army â the soldier and the
sailor, each in bis place â ha? been faithful j
unto death. And moreover.wherever they j
sleep to-night, whether it be in unknown I
graves, whether it be In the caverns of the j
sea, we in our hearts and by our lips pay >
tnem the poor tribute of our love and I
gratitude.

plause.] Let one foreign country touch
with hostile hand a fiber of that flag and
a million swords would leap from their
scabbards to defend it and the country's
honor.
"We live in a time of peace and pour
out the wealth of genius in apostrophiz
ing the victories of peace, but I say to you
that peace may sometimes mean defame,
degeneracy ar.d death. This country
should stand as the great exemplar of free

cowardly American spirit that sees liberty
strangled and her sons and daughters shot

stretching forth to rescue and to lift it up.
I say that this country of ours was
brought into being by battle. It is easier
to be a slave than a free man *. to bow the
neck than to lilt it erect; to lie down than
to take up arms and redress iniquity.
"The Government cam-* into life and to

this Government should stretch tbe law,
if necessary, in order to be true to our own
history and assist the poor little crushed
and bleeding Cuba tbat is right within the
shadow of the flag and within tbe sun-,

He emphasized as the particular glory
of the American army that its power had
never been used for purposes of aggran
dizement, and in conclusion said : "Ever
sc long as tbe citizens stand back of that
army and tbat navy, so lone a. patriotism
supports therein time of peace and is their
defender and assistant and recruit in time

"If there is any theme to which Ameri

emDlojeof the bank mentioned, having
been promoted from one clerkship to an
other until he became assistant cashier.
Then in an evil moment he yielded to the
temptation of cards and wine, and began
to use the funds intrusted to his care to
satisfy his appetites.
Like all embezzlers he expected to re
place the money, but the amount of his
stealings grew larger ani larger, and
finally when discovery became inevitable
he took $500 more and fled to New York,
where hr had a brother, and thence to
South . America, where he thought he
would find peace from his conscience and
a chance to make a living.
After his departure experts were put on
his books and it was louna that he had
made away with about $8000, covering a
period of more than a year.
11l fortune seemed to follow in bis foot
steps and a fear that ho would be located
by officers of the law led him to leave
South America and return to New York,
whence ne made his way to Canada and,
finally to Australia. Here he tared as
badly as he had in other places and finally
decided to return to America and face the
consequences. He shipped on the Ala
meda for this port as a dishwasher and
landed here ragged and almost penniless.
He learned that William Westover, who
was president of the bank he bad robbed
nt the time of the defalcation, was in this
City, and he went immediately to him,
expressing a wish to go baca* and stand
trial, saying he would go alone if Mr.
vVestover wished.
The ex-banker thought, however, tbat
it would be best to first communicate with
the East and telegraphed to Bay City
about the matter. Yesterday telegraphic
instructions came to place McCloy in cus
tody, and ne was arrested by a United
States Deputy Marshal. He" wanted to
waive examination and go back at once,
but the United States laws do not permit
of such a proceeding, and United States
Commissioner Heacoca held him in $5000
bonds. The case will come up again next
Monday, when it is expected that the
papers will be here.

The Carson prize-fight is to take place

The efforts of the Democratic prÂ»ss to

Of the 245 measures which have been

The action of the House of Representa

LEGISLATIVE WORK.
The publication in The Call yesterday of a comprehensive review of the work of
the Legislature up to the fiftieth dry of the session gave the public an opportunity to
learn exactly what has been done by our law-makers at this session and what meas
ures remain before them still to ba acted upon. The review was timely and oppor
tune, inasmuch as the fiftieth day was *.he last on which new bills can be introduced,
so that the review virtually covers the whole subject of legislation to be undertaken
this year.
It is gratifying to note that despite the time consumed in discussion of the pay*
roll scandal and the controversey over the State Printing Office appropriation, the
Legislature has done a considerable amount of business. In fact it is said that the
Assembly holds the record for industry in its work and in the amount of business
accomplished. This condition of affairs is gratifying since it reassures the public in
tho hope that this Is to be a thoroughly business session and a marked improvement
over the legislative work of recent years.
While much has been done, however, much more remains to be undertaken.
There have been introduced 1833 bills, and out of these but 245 have been disposed of.
Nearly half of the whole number of bills introduced is still in the bands of the vari
ous committees of one or the other House. It will be seen, therefore, that the legis
lators will have no reason to regret that no new bills can be Introduced, inasmuch as
they have more work before them than they can accomplish without prolonging the
session for many days.'
Of the 245 measures which have been finally dealt with, 169 have been killed, and
bnt eighteen have so far received the Governor's sanction and become law. It will be
seen that the thinning cut process is carried on with commendable vigor. If the
number of thoÂ«e which pass of the bills yet to be- acted on is proportionate to the
number which have been favorably dealt with out of the 245 already considered, we
shall not have any serious amount of new laws to study after the work of the session
is completed. .
"While the number of bills which remain to be acted on is very large, it must be
remembered that many of tbem are virtually duplicates of one another. When all
the bills relating to the same subject have been examined, the worthless ones rejected,
and those possessing merit have been combined into one omnibus measure, the num
ber before the houses will be considerably decreased. It is probable, therefore, that
prompt work may enable the Legislature to finish its session without doing injustice
to the work before it at an earlier date than would seem possible from a casual review
of the large number of measures which are apparently before iL
It is reported that those members of the Legislature who have most closely
watched the progress of business are of the opinion that it will require at least four
weeks more before adjournment. There are others, however, more sanguine of speedy
work, who believe that it will be possible to close the session on March 13. It goes
without saying that public opinion will support those members who seek the speediest
adjournment commensurate with careful legislation, and it is to be hoped the leaders
of both houses will see their way clear to finish the work at the earliest date fixed.
Taking the work of the body as a whole up to the date covered by our review it
seems to be fairly satisfactory. Some measures have been passed which the public
will not approve. Notable among these is the bill providing for the appointment of a
specialist in sociological education for this City. Such measures, however, are com.
paratively few, and the work compares favorably with that accomplished by any
previous Legislature at this staee of its session.
The larje number of bills introduced into a body whose sessions are compara
tively short renders it almost impossible to have the work of legislation done as care
fully, as thoroughly and as wisely as the public welfare requires. That, however,
is one of tne evils inherent in our political system. The only way to remedy it
would be to provide for annual sessions and extend the length of time during which
the Legislature would sit Such a remedy would probably be worse than the evil
itself. We can well afford to bear the trouble we now have rather than to risk the
experiment of more frequent legislative sessions. It seems clear that the present
body of legislators bas tried and is trying to do Its work well, and there is a reason
able hope that the closing days of the session will add new proofs to those already
given of its attention to business and its desire to subserve the public welfare.
NATIONAL APFROPEIATIONS.
In a recent interview Mr. Dingley,
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee of the House, made a defense of
the recent appropriation bill, in which he
clearly pointed out that the expenditures
provided for are by no means so extrava
gant as they have been represented in
some quarters. Mr. Dingley said:
The Government expenditures average
about $5 50 per head of population. Of this
amount $2 50 represents the expenditures for
the transaction of the ordinary business pi
the Government. Payments for pensions rep
resent $2Â«nore per head. Fifty cents of the
amount goes to paying off the Government
debt, and the other half dollar represents tho
expenses of river and harbor work, fortifica
tions, the new navy and public buildings.
It is in the expenditures represented by this
last half dollar of the per capita that extrava
gance might, perhaps, show Itself, and where
the opportunity for expansion is greatest.
The ordinary expenses of the Government
Keep pace with the growth of the population.
They have for years averaged about $2 50.
The pension legislation has not been extended
during the two last Congresses, and the pay
ments on the public debt keep about the
same.
The explanation put in this simple way
can be readily understood. Persons who
can be confused by a large array of statis
tics running up into the millions and
thereby led to believe that Congress has
been extravagant and wasteful of public
money will see from the statement made
by Mr. Dingley that the great bulk of the
appropriations is designed for the current
and necessary expenses of maintaining
the Government, and that the only chance
for any extravagance whatever is in the
appropropriations for public improve
ments, which constitute but a compara
tively small fraction of the whole.
This, as Sp-aker Reed once said, is a
"billion dollar country." It requires a
large amount of money to maintain a
Government extending over sp large a
territory and having charge of such vast
interests. We cannot expect to have the
Government of our continent adminis
tered as cheaply as that of some country
in Europe whose total area is not much
larger than a single Slate; nor can we ex
pect a new and undeveloped country like
ours to cairy on its work as cheaply as
that of a Government where wages are
less, salaries low-r and a large proportion
of Government officials content to live on
a pittance in return for the assurance of a
life position. 7:< .;..;
Appropriations for public improvement
amount to about fifty cents per capita of
the population. There is surely no ex
travagance in such expenditure as that in
a country where the prevailing prosperity
is so great compared with the rest of tbe
world, and where bo much in the way of
improvement is needed. We could well
afford to double the amount expended for
our rivers and harbors and the expansion
of our nayy and commercial marine with
out laying ourselves open to the charge of
being wasteful. ;'/':
The Philadelphia Inquirer rebukes Evan

gument, however, ignores the fact that to
serve lemonade from a punchbowl would
be a gross deception on the thirsty man.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1897.
THE VOICE OF EtJBOPE.
The debates which have taken place in
the parliaments of Great Britain, France
and Italy on the crisis in Crete show that
there is now a sharp contest in all those
countries between the policy of their gov
ernments and the sentiments of their peo
ple. The popular voice is everywhere in
favor of Greece, and it is doubtful if either
ot the three governments can long main
tain its present course in opposition to the
resolute pub ie opinion which is being
rapidly aroused to the point of a genuine
war spirit.
In the British Parliament when Mr.
Curzon, Under Secretary for Foreign Af
fairs, declared the international squadron
in the Cretan waters had no option but to
forcibly prevent the insurgents from mak
ing an attack upon Canea he was inter
rupted with cries of "Shame 1" He barely
succeeded In getting the Commons to
postpone for a time any farther debate on
the subject. A similar scene was enacted
in the French Chamber of Deputies, where
M. Hanotaux was able to quiet the oppo
sition to his policy only by securing a tem
porary postponement of the question.
The proceedings in the Italian Parlia
ment a few days ago were of the same
general character. The Government was
met with denunciations of its course, and
found no escape except by seeking to
avoid a conflict by putting off the question
to a future time.
In each of the three assemblies the Gov
ernment relied for defense of the course of
the allies in firing upon the Greeks upon
the fact that the invasion of Crete by the
Greek troops was a technical violation of
international law. They also endeavored
to excite the fears of the timid by declar
ing that any other course would lead to a
general war involving all Europe and car
rying disasters to every nation. These
arguments, as we have seen, succeeded for
a time. The question was postponed.
The issue, however, still remains, and
must be met by the Ministers of the three
powers within a few days unless they can
by some miracle succeed in bringing about
an immediate settlement of the crisis
without further attacks upon the Grecians
or the people of Crete.
It is an old saying that unsettled Issues
care nothing for the repose of nations. A
Government cannot make peace by sim
ply talking of peace. When controver
sies arise which deeply move the hearts
and minds of the people, the only thing
to be done is for the Government to re
move tbe cause of complaint. In this
case the cause of offense is the Turkish
Government, and it is not probable tbat
diplomacy, however skillful, can much
longer maintain that Government in
power against the will, the Indignation
and the conscience of aroused Europe.
GLADSTONE AND BlS__AÃo__.
There is a striking parallel at this time
between Gladstone and Bismarck. Both
are great statesmen. Both have grown
old. Both are in retirement. Here, how
ever, the parallel ends. Bismarck is rest
less, bitter and full of complaints of his
loss of power. Gladstone is active, ardent
and full of cheer, showing as prompt a
sympathy as ever with the world's move
ments and as much earnestness as ever in
taking his part in it. The contrast is be
tween the man ot" action and the man of
thought, the man of deeds and tho man of
oratory,- and it is sufficiently notable to
merit more than ordinary consideration.
' Tho great "Iron Chancellor," the founder
of an empire, the creator of united Ger
many, stands oat before the world pre
eminently as a man of action. He bas
done great deeds for which his people will
be ever truly grateful and which the world
mast needs admire, but in his fretful bit
terness, to which siicu wide publicity has
been given, there is proof that be has lost
power and feels himself in retirement a
weakling in the world, an actor lingering
superfluous on tbe stage. Bismarck being
essentially a man of action needs office
through which; to exercise his power. De
prived of office be ha* no means where
with to exert his will. He is like a me
chanic without tools, like a great military
genius without an armyâ helpless as Bona
part- at St. Helena.
Gladstone is an illustrious example of
the man of thought who can be continu
ously great both in and oat of office. Al
though out of a position of power he
makes almost a throne of his home at
Ha warden and a scepter of his pen.
Among all .the great powers of Europe
Gladstone's eloquence still holds a promi
nent place. By his sneeches and his writ
ings he forcefully leads enlightened senti
ment to definite resolves and in his retire
ment is almost as potent as when Prime
Minister. No complaint of loss of power
is heard from his lips, nor will there be so
long as tongue and pen avail him to
utter what he thinks.
This contrast between two among the
greatest of our contemporaries leads, to
the conclusion that in the power of con
tinuing to perform useful work all through
life and in attaining satisfaction and hap
piness in the retirement of old age the
man of thought is superior to the man of
action. It seems that one who is distinct
ively a man of thoughtâthat is a man
capable of finding satisfactory employ
ment in the workings of his mind, even
though he is shut out from any active
share in the world's great movements,
acquires a completeness of character, a
power for good and a capacity for joy
which he who is too restlessly eager for
eternal action to meditate deeply can
never attain.

JUSTICE F.LLD' > LONG TERM
The Washington correspondent of the New
York Commercial Advertiser writes: From a
hint dropped by a friend of Justice Stephen J.
Field it Is believed that before Major McKin
ley has been President many months he will
have a vacancy in the Supreme Court to fill
through the resignatlen of Justice Field, the
dean of the bench, who has been continually
in the harness since 18.3. The remark that
foretells this change was: "California will
have the head of the Interior Department for
half a year and Missouri for three and one
half years of the McKinley administration."
It was during the discussion, of some prom
inent ewes before the Land Office at present
that the statement was made. There were
present two close friends of the California
jurist who within six months wl.l have com
plete i the most remarkable term ever served
on the National Supreme bench. One of these
made statements which would indicate that
there Is a foreknowledge of the resignation of
Field by the middle of the summer, which is
to be followed by the promotion ,. of Judge Mo-
Kenna. 7.
Tne significance of the latter part of there
man, lies in the fact that the Canton advice-p
--are that McKinley promised the Missouri
friends of Major William Warner that he
should be mane assistant to McKenna. His
promotion at the same time would be a grace
ful compliment to the State.
Justice Field has not sat on the bench much
of the time since the beginning of his long
sickness last summer, and but for his ambition
to round out the longest term in the Supreme
bench yet on reord it is believed that he would
have retired long ago. A friend who dined with
him only a few days ago says the aged jurist
is fall! g away more rapidly than expected in
one of his age. Therp.- seems no doubt that his
term will close when he has eclipsed Justice
Marshall's record of long service from 1801 to
1835. Justice Field will exceed that term
early next year.
A MODES* OFF. E-bEEKER.
j Washington Post.
In the district which Congressman Ellis of
Oregon represents are two Presidential post
offices, Astoria and Portland. Only two, re
member, for that is the point of this story,
The other day, whi'o Mr. Ellis was seated at
his desk in the House, a card was handed to
him. He went luto the lobby and found a
young man. Forthwith the said young man
proceeded to address Mr. Ellis in this wise :
"Mr. Ellis, I have come to the conclusion
that I want to go West. I think that the
climate will agree with me and that there is a
chance out there for me to make a living. I
have saved a little money, but Ido not want
to take any risk of not finding employment.
I have come to you, therefore, with a sugges
tion. Mr. McKinley knows my father very well,
and I think mat he also remembers roe. Now,
if I could go out to Oregon as Postmaster of
Astoria I would settle there, and I am sure Mr.
McKinley would appoint me if you will only
recommend me."

Topknot Pigeon.â E* G. S., Livermore, Cal
"Topknot pigeon" is a common name aoplied
to the Goura>(lophyrus coronatns, or Columba
coronato), by far the largest of the pigeon fam
ily, native of Java, New Guinea and other isl
ands of the Indian archipelago. The head is
adorned *ith a. large semi-circular crest of
narrow straight silky feathers, always carried
erect "Topknot" is any knot, tuft or crest
worn or growing on the head, and is also ap
plied to any egret, crest or tuft of feathers on
the head of a bird, also to any projecting or
conspicuous ornament for the head, specifi
cally a bow of ribbon that formed a part oi the
headdress of the women of the seventeenth
century. Farquhar. in the first comedy ("Love
and a Bottle*') that he wrote, in IG.B, says:
"We had that among other laudable fashions
from London; I think it came over with your
mode of wearing high topknots."
In "Popular Antiquities" there is the follow
ing in regard to topknots: "It is undoubtedly
irom the Danish that the 'bride favors, or
â¢the topknots' at marriages, which were con
sidered as the emblems of the ties of duty and
affection between the bride and spouse, have
been derived."

BISHOP ABMITAGE OBPHAKAQE.
Trustees and Officers Elected to Serve

! The annual meeting of the Bishop Arm
itage Orphanage Association was held yes
terday aiternoon, at which Mrs. F. C.
Brewer, the president, in -presenting her
report, explained that it had been consid
ered advisable to hold the annual meetings
of the association henceforward on the last
Tuesday in February, Instead of in July,
as heretofore.
The removal of the children from the
San Mateo house to the association's new
headquarters at the corner of Second and
Folsom streets did not imply the abandon
ment of the former, which would be used
for the supply of farm produce. The acqui
sition of the old Marlborough bouse bad
also been deemed advisable owing to the
recent decision of the Supreme Court,
which ruled the orphanage out of all lega
cies while located in San Mateo.
The new headquarters, it was also stated,
will be formally dedicated by Right Rev.
Bishop Nichols on Sunday afternoon at 3
o'clock.

January 1, 1897, amounting to $4">69 37,
leaving a balance on band of $956 78; un
paid bills still due to January 1. 1897, $300
leaving a net oalance of $156*78. '

GREEK AND SAXON
SIDE BY SIDE
Public Invited to Attend
the Ball in Aid of
Crete-
Guests Will Dance Beneath the
Overhanging Fo'ds of Two
National Flags. ,
_-____ââ
Bishop Nicholas of th Greek Church
7; Has Contributed to the Rolief
Fund.
The special committee appointed by the
Hellenic Mutual Benevolent Society to
raise funds for the Cretan .sufferers has re
ceived a donation of $50 from Right Rev.
Bishop Nicholas, of the Greek Catholic
Church, accompanied by the following
note:
May it please the benevolent society to re
ceive from me $50 for the unfortunate Cretans.
Nicholas,
Bisnop of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands,
honorary president of the Hellenic Society.
The Bishop's donation and good wishes
will be suitably acknowledged by the
committee.
The splendid results of last Sunday's
mass-meeting were not enough to satisfy
tne members of tue committee, who are
now making elaborate preparations for
the entertainment and ball to be given in
the Turn Verein Hail. 323 Turk street, on
Saturday evening. That, it is expected,
will serve to add substantially to the snug
little sum raised on Sunday. The pro
moters wish it to be understood that both
the entertainment and ball will be free to
the general public. In fact, one of the
objects of the former is to furnish an ex
planation of the true motive and object of
the Greeks in San Francisco in encourag
ing the present agitation. To that end A.
Splivalo, the well-Known attorney, has
prepared an address lor delivery in Eng
lish on the evening in question.
The Greeks who attend the ball will
wear tbe picturesque national costume of |
their native country, and the interior
decoration* promise to be of an elaborate
character. Two standard-bearers carry
ing the Greek and American flags and
resplendent in uniform will be in at
tendance, and two young Greek girls,
elegantly and appropriately costumed,
will represent, respectively, persecuted
Crete and Liberty, in whose name and for
whose possession the former is so gal
lantly fighting.
The following committees have already
been selected:
Arrangementsâ A. Kosta (chairman), C.
Demetra-, X. Damianafcis, George Checure!-, â¢
D. Samios, C. Capiios, Â£. Coklnos; floor man
ager, M. D.Vemvales; floor committee â George
Fundas, P. Vretios, A. Simacopulos, P. Pan
dages, P. Pappademos.
The officers of the Hellenic Society.
under whose auspices the ball will be
given, are as follows:
President, C. Demetrak; vice-president,
George Fundas; treasurer, A. Kosta; secretary,
A Papageorge.
"We feel," said Mr. Demetrak yester
day, "that the Amer.can people ought to
know exactly what we wish to accomplish
and why we wish to do so. We are con- '
vinced thai as soon as they obtain this
knowledge they will sympathize with us i
quite as well as with the Cubans, becanse, I
as Professor Putzker so well said last j
Sunday, the Turks are a barbarous people,
who are persecuting those of a different
religion. The Cretans have fought 300
years for liberty and are still fightfng. It
seems to us nothing less than a sin for
the powers to oppose the Greeks, who seek !
to assist them. We claim no more than |
justice. We ask the citizens of America, j
and particularly of this City and Cali- j
fornia, to examine the question fairly and I
honestly. The Turks hate the Christians,
and the outrages they commit upon them '
are terrible. It is well known that they J
dishonor the family life of the Cretans, '
abducting young girls to stock their
harems. If the Americans give us only
their eood will we shall accept it with
gratitude. The latest telegrams announc
ing-he bombardment of the Greelc camps
by the warships of the powers has aroused
great indignation among us, and we be
lieve that this indignation will be shared
by all fair-minded people."

who was born in the Bermudas, wore a fine
wnite lace shawl made by her p randmother at

tributed $ioe Each in Order to
Join the V.nture.
Manager . Reinhart of ihe South Sea
island colonizing expedition is tne hap
piest man In seven States. He has at
least $10,000 "cash on hand," and so far
has only paid out $2500 for the old brig
Percy Edward and say another $1000 for
necessary repairs. Where the colonists
are going they do not know, and further
more they do not seem to care. Nearly
all of them are unsophisticated farmers
from the interior, and like the unfortu
nates who made an excursion from Aus
tralia to Paraguay in the Royal Tar, they
seem to think they have the ball at their
feet and all they have to do is to make
the necessary exertion and a fortune is
theirs.
Some of the members of the expedition
say they are going "to the South Sea
islands just for fun," and that they do not
expect to have anything but an enjoyable
cruise after an imaginary island. The
fact still remains, however, that the Percy
Edwards was built exactly thirty-one
years ago in Boston, Mass., and that her
late owner did not fit her out again for
another whaling cruise. The brig be
longed to James McKenna, and two years
ago she went to the Arctic, but did not
make enough money to pay the $1 that
each member of the crew was paid off
with. Since then she lay up in Oakland
Creek until the man who invented "the
Adamless Eden" came along, and then
there was a demand ior a vessel tbat could
be bought cheap. The Percy Edwards is
189 tons net, 105 feet 4 inches long. 28 feet
1 inch beam and 10 feet 1 inch deep. She
has been thoroughly overhauled and re
paired, and a cruise in her in the Southern
seas will be as safe as in any whaler that
has left port during the past month.
"Well! well! well!" said Henry Peter
son, the champion oarsman, yesterday,
when he viewed the preparations being
made, "they sa*- they are going to have
plenty ot fun. Well, I'm willing to gam
ble dollars to doughnuts that they'll get
all they expect. Why, they do not even
know where they are going" and God help
the man who is going on a roving edi
tion in the Soutnern seas in search â
nothing."
"This is the worst comic opera I have
ever witnessed," said an employe of the
Harbor Commission. "There Is not the
slightest chance in the world for a man in
New Guinea without money and as to the
Solomon group or the New Hebrides, the
men who go there should carry a Gatllng
gun and plenty of ammunition. There
are more cannibals than Eves down there
and the passengers on the Percy Edward
nad better look out."
Nearly three years ago a similar expedi
tion to the one planned to leave on the
Percy Edward next Thursday left Austra
lia on the bark Royal Tar. It was bound
for Paraguay and everything that the
colonists had was put into the general
fund and all and sundry were to share and
share alike. A concession had b-en re
ceived from the Govrnment of South
America and each family was to receive
so much land and each single man was to
be given so much in proportion. It was a
second South Sea bubble and disaster fol
lowed it from the moment the vessel
reached its destination. The colony m
ow almost deserted and the colonists are
nearly all back in Australia, sadder but
wiser men. Will the expedition on the
Percy Edward prove more successful, is
the question of interest on the water front
just now.
First Mate Driggs of the brig is confi
dent that the venture will be a success,
and says tbat besides owning thevessei
and her contents there is $7000 in the
treasury. Where they are going he does
not know, and the destination will not be
known until tne vessel gets to sea. "She
will clear for a cruise in the southern
seas," .aid he. According to him the pub
lic and the press looked upon the scheme
as chimerical, but he is certain that it will
be a success. '
Three young farmers joined the expedi
tion yesterday, and each paid $100 .or a
chance in tbe glorious future tbat awaits
them in the new Eden,' serpents and sav
ages barred. .._'â¢.'â¢ â¢
In the meantime the Percy Edward
will probably clear to-day on "a cruise to
the South Sea island--, "and Thursday will

LEALE AT GRANTS PASS.
After Rounding- the Horn a Dozen
Times He Was Seasick on
. a Flume.
Captain Leale of the steamer Caroline
had a peculiar experience during bis re
cent trip to Grants Pass. He has been
around the Horn a dozen times and never
was seasick, yet when he came to walking
a Hume at the place mentioned be enjoyed
the first sensation of genuine seasickness
he has Known.* The party was on a visit
to one of the mines, and Leale was the
only sailor in the crowd. The sight of the
.rushing water reminded bim of the Caro
line in a sea way, and th* experience was
so unexpected that be immediately he
came sick. In fact, according to bis own
account, be had to get down and clutch
the crossbrace in order to save himself
from falling. Finally bis companions got
him on his feet again, and Leale finally
reached the mine in good order. On the
return trip he had recovered his sea leg",
and the captain of the Caroline was on
deck again yesterday. He thinks so much
of Grants Pass tbat he vows be will give
up Bteamboating and start in as a rancher
and miner. TSÂ£k_
. Powell-street wharf is dangerous and
vessels will not dock there lor months to
come. The Farallon went there on Sun
day and landed considerable lumber and
this caused the center of the pier to sag.
The piles gave way and it looked as
though everything was going, but luckily
something held and the structure was
saved. Yesterday Chief Wharfinger Root
issued instructions to the D. H. Bibb
Lumber Company and the Simpson Lum
ber Company to remove their belongings
at once and also posted a notice to the
effect that the wharf is dan.erou- for
ve-sels to lie alongside. This particular
wharf bas been a dead loss to the com
mission from the start. Vessels cannot
lie at it at any time without extra moor
ing lines, and when a gale comes up they
all seek safer quarters. Last year over
100 feet was cut away from the outer end,
and now it would not be at all surprising
to bear of the present commission order
ing the whole structure torn down.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia sailed for Honolulu yesterday with
the following -passengers:

The gang oi gypsies who have been
making their headquarters in Mill Valley
lor a month past attempted to gel away
on the vessel but failed. They had their
pa-sage money all read)*, but the captain
demanded that each bead of a family
should put up $50 to show tnat be was not
a pauper, as otherwise he could not land
in Hawaii. .Tnis the gypsies could not
do, so the vessel sailed without them. It
afterward transpired tbat tbey are pro
fessional beggars and that among them
they have over $2000, but;that it is mearly
all in negotiable paper on European
banks. When the Australia sailed Ser
geant Tom Mahoney marched them back
to the Sansaiito ferry and saw them safely'
en route for Marin County. The men of
the party say they will have all the neces
sary money on hand before the Alameda
sails and that they will go to Honolulu on
her.
Division 2 of the Naval Battalion had its
revenge yesterday. Jack Meyer of Divi
sion 1 and Harry Hart-nan (Handsome
Harry) bad a dispute about the relative
merits of the two. crews. Harry asserted
that bad Division 2 bad the gig its crew
would have won hands down In spite of
the poor turn. Jack thought differently
and offered to back his opinion. "You
were in the race," said Harry. "Now, I'll
row you around the Anglesey just for fun
and show you how easy it is to beat a
member of 'the champion crew." Meyer
took him up and the race was rowed.
Hartman won hands down and Meyer
paid for the drinks.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
Doric sailed for the Orient yesterday.
Among the passengers was Commodore
McCarthy of the San Francisco Yacht
Club, who is going to make a tour ot
China. The vessel was heavily laden and.
H. Maitland Kersey, who is out here in

down to see her off.

CALIFORNIA BONDS
QUOTED IN LONDON
A Distinction Accorded for
the First Time in
History,
The Honor Secured to . the Ha
waiian Commercial and
Sugar Company.
Stock and Bond Exchange Look to It
as ths Entering Wedge for
Other Securities.
The interesting Information came by
cable to the Stock and .Bond Exchange'
yesterday tbat the recent issue o: the local
bond- of the Hawaiian Commercial and
Sugar Company of this City had been
given an official quotation by the .London
Stock Exchange.: -.*- _*.'-â¢
Tbis is an entirely unique distinction
it being the first purely Calilornian
security so honored. Tho issue of three
quarters of a million of these bonds was
recently floated by Colonel George W.
Macfarlane in London. This issue is a
conversion of the bonds of a former issue
which had been running for some years at
a 7 per cent rate of interest. That issue
roaturea last year and the conversion was
made at _>_ per cent. The bonds have
been also listed on tbe local Stock Ex
change and will thus have tbe advantage
of a double quotation, an advantage said to
be enjoyed by no other bonds here, and
which is certain, say dealers, to send them
to a good premium in course of time.
Tne official listing of tbis California se
curity in London, it is thought, will prove
the entering wedge for floating other
local bonds and shares of other and larger
California corporations in that great
money market. This is why tbe news cre
ated so much interest on 'Change yes
terday. â¢'â¢ â â ', "â '.'; â '.'â¢'â  " '
"And why is it such a difficult matter
to obtain recognition for Californian se
curities?'* was asked of Colonel Macfar
lane yesterday.
"Chiefly because of the long procession
of insecurities that nave been offered there
as bona-fide securities within recent
years," he said. "While there are plenty
of sound and pood paying investments in
California, there is no doubt that London
has been fooled a great deal in wildcat
land schemes and other ventures.
"Any security quoted on the London
Stock Exchange, however, has a standing
in financial circles thai it cannot obtain
in any other way. This is because of ti.e
extraordinary care taken by the exchange
to ascertain its status. It has taken
something over six mouths for these se
curities to pass tbe ordeal. A great num
ber of documents had to be submitted to
the Stock Exchange committee, which is
composed of thirty members of the high
est standing in financial circles. They re
quire of tbe issuing house in London, be
iore .ranting a quotation, a complete and
verified list of all the subscribers to the
loan and the amount taken by each. The
committee must ascertain if the subscrip
tions and allotments are made in good
faith, and must find that no allotment
has been made to any member of tbe syn- ;

will official recognition be given by the
Stock Exchange to the bonds.
"This is done to prevent stock jobbery
and the consequent impairment of the
credit of the company whose bonds are so
placed. It is done likewise to protect tbe
public who invest in securities upon the
express assurance of the exchange com
mittee that the representations made in

a special value and usefulness, being

"In the course of time," continued Col
onel Macfarlane, "the payments of inter

to a premium, which ultimately reaches a
point that represents a certain unit of in
terest, so to speak. They can be then con
verted at par into other's bearing less in
terest. In this way our California bonds
may be placed at the same rate of inter
est which older and richer countries have
obtained through the good faith shown in
the dealings of our people with the finan
cial world of London. This is really what
has taken place, as I explained,
in regard to the Hawaiian Com
mercial and Sugar Company bonds,
being converted in its second issue
from a 7 to a s>_ per , cent basis.
This is especially notable in tbis case, it
being a distinctly local company, the
management being entirely in the hands
of tbe board, of directors in this City.
There are, you know, Californian com
panies formed in London, the board of

different matter." 7 7 777. ' 7
Colonel Macfarlane has had a long ex
perience in London financial affairs and
speaks from an intimate knowledge. He
took Hawaiian Government bonds in
Londonâ ooo,ooo of themâ and they
went to 13 per cent premium. He after
ward floated the Hawaiian Street Railway
bonds. This was a London company that
operated the road from London. He also
floated tbe stock of a large sugar estate,
tbe management of which was divided
between London and San Francisco.
A LAND SWINDLE.
The Grand Jury Hears "Evidence Is a
Sharp- Practice Case Between
Farmers.
The Grand Jury was employed yester
day in bearing a quantity of testimony in
several allegations of crime. The case of
Jacob L. Thurston, charged with firing a
shot at George H. Pettis in a saloon en
San Jose avenue recently, was begun and
will be resumed on Friday.
A number of witnesses were heard in an
allegation against George W., John T. and
C. H. Donaldson, charging them with
having swindled George W. Robinson in
a land transaction. Tbe story goes that
Robinson exchanged a farm in Monterey
County for a larger farm with Donald
son, in consideration for which he not
only gave a clear deed for his farm, but
$1500 in cash. It has since developed, ac
cording to the allegations, that Donald
son's farm, for whicn 'he gave what pur
ported to be a deed, was,' in fact, not his,
having been sold to the State lor taxes, as
well as being heavily mortgaged. This
case will also be concluded on Friday. It
is almost certain that an indictment will
be found. 77. 7*7 77 -.7,77

Daniel Hogan and R. J. Mullins, the two
young men who presented a forged order for

charge of forgery. They were also suspected
of breaking into the cigar and stationery store

afternoon, but the police have been unable to
find any evidence against them.
CYCLERS WANT A
WESTERN LEAGUE
Local Wheelmen Heartily
in Sympathy With ths
Proposed Movement.
"Secession and Independence"
â¢ Is the New Cry, Adopted
Since the Convention.
If California Takes the Lead, She
Will Have the Support of
Many Sister States.
Among the cyclers and those interested
in the sport there was but one topic of
conversation yesterday, and it was such a
satisfying morsel of gossip that none
seemed to tire of discussing it. They
talked of the League of American Wheel
men and the proposed secession of Cali
fornia and many other Western divisions.
. The secession movement is gaining
friends here with every hour. The return
of R. M. Welch and nis report of the un
favorable and .elfish legislation adminis
tered by the National assembly has in
censed the local cycling leaders, and they
are anxious to take the initiative in a
movement to better the racing interests
here and elsewhere, with the full assur
ance of hearty support from all the West
ern and many of the Southern and Central
States.
Great faith is placed in Mr. Welch, and
rightly, too, and the wheelmen feel that
his view shall be their-. He was the or
ganizer of the California Division eleven
years ago. and has been actively con
nected with it and has been indefatigable
in his efforts lor the general good of the
members ever since. He is known to be
fair, unbiased and impartial, and is not
one to pass judgment too quickly. There
fore when he returned here and told of
the state of affairs in the East it needed
no confirmation, though such had been
received by several in the shape of private
letteis from his fellow-delegate, Judge
Kerrigan, who is still in New York.
Regarding what may be done, and to
show the feeling of other States besides
California over the action of tbe recent as
sembly, it may be opportune to quote
here an editorial from the last issue of
Cycling West of Denver, one of the strong
est wheel papers published, and which
presents the sentiments of Colorado, Wy
oming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,
Texas, Utah and the whole Northwest.
With no desire to be sensational I cannot
resist the prophecy tnat the arrogance of the
Eastern L. A. W. contingent, as demonstrated
in the last assembly, will result in secession
on the part of the entire West, if not, indeed,
of the South as welL To be brutally frank
about it, the seeds of rebellion sown in previ
ous discpntent have already germinated in
the heat of natural resentment and the L. A.
W. structure is crumbling in rottenness. The
New York and Massachusetts coterie have
pressed their supercilious dominance too far
and the back of the long suffering camel has
broken. -'
There will be a new league I A league that
will have sense as its fundamental basis with
a superstructure of equity, and,' better still,
efficiency. A league of wheelmen in which
the meaningless, effete, obsolete term "ama
teur" will have no recognition. It will be a
white man's league; a league which will
recognizs the sovereign ritht of every State to
formulate its own regulations as to the hold
ing of Sunday races, contingent on the
desires of . its own constituency. A league
which will institute no star chambers of any
kind and a league which will from its very in
ception control cycle racing in its entirety.
It will be, primarily, an associated union of
State leagues under the general direction of
a National directorate. It will assume and
usurp no inequable power, no ludicrous arro
gance of jurisdiction over any but those whom
it has a legal and moral right to govern. There
will be no imbecility and injustice of '-sus
pension pending investigation" of spiteful
charges. It will support no personal "offi
cial" organ for the convenience of any edi
torial ass who lusts to inflict his oninionate
idiocy upon a suffering constituency. In
short, it will have incorporated none of the
senseless features which have^made the L. A.
W. monstrosity a butt for contumely and ridi
cule. The pretensions of the new league will
be no insult to every decent man's intelli
gence. It will simply be what the L. A. W. is
notâ an organization for the conservation and
promotion of the interests of cycling in their
entirety.
The necessity of secession from any form of
government is deplorable in itself. The advis
ability thereof is always more or less prob
lematical, but the results are always beneficial
when such secession leads to the elimination
of an abuse or the adjusting of a wrong.

scribed virtue and ope easily exhausted.
Tyranny in any iorm is unallowable in these
days of individual equality, and when a few
interested members of an association acquire
the power and evince, the disposition to exer
cise a drastic mismanagement of Its policy in
their own personal or sectional aggrandize
ment, that association is in imminent danger
of disruption. The L. A. W. is on the verge â :>Â£
a crisis, it is even worse. ii has been suicidal
enough to dig its own grave and to put its foot
in it. It has had warnings 6ufflcientand it has
chosen to disregard them. Wnen an Institution
has undermined its own foundation and la
crumbling in structural rottenness it were
better that It should fall. The L. A. W. la tot
tering to Its ultimate destruction.
Until some action is taken, the whole
work of the league on this coast will be
stagnated, and it is very doubtful if it
will ever go on under any of the present
officers. Nothing will be done until Chief
Consul Kerrigan returns, when lie will
probably be . flooded with resignations
from local consuls and committeemen.
As he will probably want to hand in his
own at the same time, it is hard to say
what the end will be.
The feelin_ of secession is very strong.
It has gone to a considerable extent
already among tbe higher officials. A
half dozen of them were ..gathered on
Market street yesterday afternoon dis
cussing the situation. . "Where is your
league button?" asked one of another, re
ferring to a lapel button they all wear.
"Here in my pocket," he replied, showing
it. "I took it off this morning; I'm
ashamed to wear it."

Was Insane.
John Miller, charged with the murder
of Jamps Childs on the 18th of last Novem

It is understood that Miller's defense
will be based on the theory that he was
insane at the time he fired the fatal shot.
Childs did hot know Miller and met his
death because he returned to help a
woman who was being pursued by Miller
with intent to murder. The tragedy oc

BARNES TO SPEAK
FOR CUBA LIBRE
He Condemns the Cleveland
- Administration for Its
Apathy.
The Local League's Mass-Meet
ing Will Be Attended by
â¢ All Classes.
Reasons for Believing That McKin
ley's Cabinet Will Call Spain
to Time.
Every arrangement for the forthcoming
mass-meeting of the friends of Cuba that
can be perfected before the meeting of
the general committee has now been j
made.
The. general committee of the league
will meet at California Hall, Bush and
Powell streets, on Friday night. The
business will be to organize to promote
the work of the league and make arrange
ments for the mass-meeting.
The committee felt gratified last night
at having made arrangements for a num
ber of short speeches at the mass-meeting.
In addition to speeches by ex-Senator
Frank McGowan, Attorney A. R. Kanaga, j
W. S. Scott, H. E. Highton, General |
Salomon and A. Ruef arrangements were j
completed yesterday for an address by |
General W. H. L. Barnes, one of the
most ardent friends of the Cuban revo
lution.
Speaking of the . matter yesterday
General Barnes said:
"I shall be very much pleased to speak
for the Cuban League. They are doing
a loyal work, and Jones and Mascherini :
and all the others back of the movement!
deserve great credit.
"1 am outraged and incensed at the
brutality of the Spanish, whose barbarities
are revolting; but a thing that makes me |
feel just as bad is the pusillanimity of !

decisive when the McKinley administra- j
tion is fully under way. If they do not |

A RISE IN GRAIN BAGS.
The Price Going Up on Account
of a Considerable Short
age.
j j
State Prison Directors Have Made an
Advance en the Convict-Made
Stock.
. ' From all indications there will be a
scarcity of grain bags this year. The
market has already felt the influence of
this state of affairs. As usual the poor
farmer will have to suffer and but little
assistance may be expected even from the
convict-manipulated looms in the jute
mills at the San Quentin State prison.
Within the past few days there has been
a great jump in the price of grain bags
and the top figures are far from reached
yet. The Pacific Coast usually consumes
about 35,000.030 grain bags. Last year five
sailing .vessels from Calcutta arrived on
this coast laden with about sixty million
bags. Two of these vessels landed at
Portland, Or., and three at this port.
This year bat three vessels are to arrive
laden with grain bags, and they will not
carry over 26,000,000 bags. As stated the
average annual consumption is about
35,000,000. The shortage will have to be
made up by shipping by steamer, which
comes high. On. the sailing vessels the
freight is $3 50 per ton of two Dales, each
bale containing 2000 bags, but oh the
steamers the freight amounts- to $10 per
ton or for 2000 baps. The difference will,
of course, be added to the cost of the bags
and the farmers will have to stand it.
The Board of State Prison Directors is
fully aware of this condition of affairs, and
it has not been slow to take advantage of
the market. Ear.y in January a lot of
1,000,000 bags were offered at $4 65 spot
cash, as the directors wanted to raise
some money. At that time there .was no
t great intimation of danger and the sales
were small. About February 13 the War
den was authorized to sell 1,000.000 bag*
at $4 75. It did not take long to dispose
of the 2,000,000 at that price. .
At the meeting of the board last Satur
day the price was jumped to 5 cents, or $5
â¢ per hundred in lots not to exceed 10,000 to
legitimate farmers or grain-growers. The
quantity to be sold is limited to 500,000
bags. At present Â«here is about 1,500,000
grain bags in bond at San Quentin, and by
July or August this number will be in
creased by 750,000.
With the prospect of a shortage in the
supply and the uncertainty of wbat the
next tariff on jute may be the farmers will
be likely to pay good stiff prices this year
for bags for their grain.
; CUT ON THE CHIN.
Result of a Row in a Valencia-Street
l'akery.
Fred Vallandt, cook in Ruiz's bakery,
836 Valencia street, and Fred Ludeman,
driver of one of the wagons, had a dis
pute yesterday afternoon and Ludeman
cut Vallandt on tbe chin with a Knife,
inflicting an ugly gash and Vallandt was
taken to the City and County Hospital
in the patrol-wagon, where his wounded
chin was stitched and dressed.
Ludeman was .arrested, by Policeman
Job!; Young and A. 11. Riehl, and taken
to the Seventeenth -street station, where
lie was booked ou the charge of assault to
murder.
The Suits Against Mrs. Craven.
The suits of the Fair estate against .Mrs. Net

court and the trial was postponed until the
Ist of next montn. -
incubus they might as well go out of the
business of trying to govern." -
In this connection it should be remem
bered that John Sherman is one of the
stanchest of the friends of Cuba, and he
is looked on as a strong power in the Mc-
Kinley administration. Possibly he would
not have been so outspoken had he known
how close he would be to the administra
tion, but it is well known that Sherman
has been an avowed opponent of the
Cleveland policy of non-interference and
an advocate of drastic measures for
Cuba's relief. ; G '._
Attorney A. R. Kanaga, formerly a
well-known Ohio attorney, but for ten
years prominent in Washington and Cal
ifornia, is a strong friend of Cuba. He
also knows McKinlev very well. Speak
ing of the Cuban question, he said:
"1 think there is every reason to be
lieve that the McKinley administration
will do something for the Cubans. They
ought to do it by all means and without
delay."
Callers continue to visit the headquar
ters daily, and every mail brings letters
of encouragement to the secretary. The
following came yesterday:
HAROLD, Cal., Feb! 21, 1897. !
Faust Mascherini â Dear Sir : I am
pleased to sec that there is such a wide
â  spread sympathy with the Cuban pa.
triots. 1 write to assure you of my
hearty sympathy with the cause of
Cuban liberty, and incidentally to offer
my services should an opportunity pre
sent itself of sending troops to Cuba.
1 have had very little military experi
ence (eighteen months in >'. G. C. Sev
enth), but such as 1 am, Cuba is welcome
to mc.
There are twenty or thirty men who
would be glad to go with mc. lam 22
years of age and very strong physically.
Should there be a chance for us to go,
kindly let me know. Yours for the cause
of liberty everywhere, 7: â¢ * - â¢ *,> .

you might forward my letter to Secretary
Quesada. Â*"_;'__â¢ H?. C. T.J,
The foregoing is a fair sample of the
letters from men who stand ready to do
more than talk should occasion arise.
The following is a letter of another type,
of which there are many:

- FOR HIS INSANE SISTER.
William Siangan's Property Will Be
Devoted to Alleviating Suffering.
The -.ill of the late William Mangan
was filed in. the County Clerk-, office yes
terday by Attorney Daly. It is a peculiar
document, written on a small scrap of
paper about 4 by 2 inches in size.
At first It was thought that Mangan
died intestate, but in looking over tbe
papers this small screed, written with a
lead pencil on a page torn from a pocket
book, was discovered. Jt reads as follows:
San Francisco, Ca:., Aug. 6, 1896.
I, William Mangan, leave all and everything
I have ol this world's goods to my sister, Delia
Mangan. She shall have all power to do as
she pleases with it **-ithout bonds. Nobody
shall have power to question her authority to
do as she pleases with it.
William Mangan.
On the opposite side of the document is
the statement that the testator never
made any other will.
Mangan's estate is - estimated to be
worth $7500. The sister to whom the
property is bequeathed' is insane and an
inmate of the asylum at Ukiah. Steps
will bo taken to have her provided with
all the comforts to which a paying patient
in that institution may ba entitled.
Smuggled Opium Sold.
A quantity of smuggled opium was sold at
the Appraisers' store yesterday at unusually
high prices, and of the 185 tins on hand 50
werÂ» old at $4 00 per tin and the remuinder
at $4 30 per tin. These prices are considered
to denote that opium is scarce lv the ban Fran
cisco market.*

THE SAN FRANCISCO WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1897.
A FIELD DAY
FOR THE DOCTORS
Played a Leading Part
in the Supervisors
Yesterday.
Dr. Do_ge Submitted an Argu
ment on Dangers Due to
Expectoration.
Committee on Legislation Hade a
Suggestion for a Street-Law
Amendment.
The doctors in the Board of Supervisors
had a field day yesterday. Dr. Rottanzi
presided and Dr. Dodge, as chairman of
the Hospital Committee, filed the report
of leading interest.
Dr. Dodge urged the passage of tbe order
prohibiting expectoration on the floors of
public buildings and sidewalks anu sub
mitted a long report. This set forth that
the habit is disgusting and in the nature
of a public nuisance. The principal fact
urged -was that consumption is propagated
often by the habit. A part of tbe report
bearing on this point was as follows:
There are certain parts In tne south ol France
that were iormcr'y noted health resorts for
this class of patients, that have become hot
teds of infection, largely owing to the satura
tion of. the. soil by Its long exposure to the
presence of large numbers of consumptives.
Even now many physicians hesitate to send
patients to many of our own health resorts in
the southern part of this State, lor fear of the
evil results tnat follow the aggregation of any
considerable number of these oalients.
Scattered about sidewalks and on floors,
the method oi infection by sputum is direct.
Gathered on shoes, it is carried directly into
our homes, infecting carpets and rising Ina
fl:.e dust wheu these are swept. And wnile
the female portion of our population persist
in wearing long skirts to their dresses on the
streets, just so long are they in constant dan
ger. Cases hate come to your writers' notice
of womon who had been observant enough to
notice that whenever they ripped the binding
from the bottom of their dress skirt to replace
It they contracted a severe cough, and no
doubt here lies a great danger.
Your committee docs not desire or rather
will not attempt to legislate against the wear
ing of si-ch garments on the street. It does,
however, desire to see suitable legislation
taken with a view of lessening the propaga
tion of this dreadful disease, consumption. j
Many Eastern cities, as -roll as several cities
and towns in this Stale, are successfully en
forcing orders relating to this habit, and your
committee would ask the adoption by this
board of the order which it has prepared on
this subject. ;'. ;'.
This report was adopted by the board.
Tbe ordinance transferring from the
Fire Department to the Police Depart
ment the duty of keeping the aisles and
lobbies of theaters clear during perform
ances went over for another week, upon
motion of Supervisor Britt, the motion be
ing seconded by Supervisor Smith. Mr.
Britt said that the purpose of his motion
was to give the chiefs of the two depart
ments time to come to soma understand
ing before the question should be argued
by the board.
The order providing that the public
printing shall be done only in offices which
are approved by the labor unions went
over for one week more, Supervisor Smith
only voting no. .;*.*',*::
A communication was received from Dr.
J. F. Morse, charman of the Committee on
Receiving Hospital of the Board of Health.
asking that the driver or the Receiving
Hospital ambulance may be required to I
purchase a uniform in accordance with the
order of the Board of Health.
The ordinance favored ' by the Board of
Health, as introduced by Dr. Hart, to pre
vent the spraying of clothes by the mouth
in Chinese laundries, was received.
James H. O'Brien asked that the Super
intendent of Streets be instructed to enter
into a contract with him "for the 30-foot
front for which the City and County is
liable, on the crossing of Gough street and
Willow avenue." :;"â¢?; -:â¢,*.! &&?'<<â¢%:
li. M. JS'ewhall petitioned for the can
cellation of assessments against the Lon
don Assurance Corporation and the Atlas
Assurance Company.
A draft of an act to amend the street
law was received from the Merchants' As
sociation. The principal point is a pro
vision requiring a contractor for paving
to maintain the pavement laid by him
free of cost and to keep it in good condi
tion for a period of not less than five years',
with the exaction of a guarantee. '
The Committee on Judiciary submitted
a report dealing with the draft of a bill
submitted by the City and County Attor
ney to acquire by condemnation or pur
chase lana or property for the laying out.
opening, extending, widening or straight
ening, in whole or. in part, for a distance
of 500 feet or less, of any road, highway,
boulevard, street, â¢ square, lane, etc. Con
cerning this the committee expressed the
opinion "that whenever property is to be
acquired for public use proceedings should
be taken under the law of eminent do
main and the City and County acquire the
same at tne public expense. The com
mittee also reported in favor of the I
amendment of Assembly bill 151, to pro
vide the mode for .changing grades of
public streets, etc., by striking out the
provision as to making protests of the own
ers or one-half or more of the owners of
the property terminate all proceedings.
Concerning this the committee reported:
"The object of changing grades is for the
benefit of the property, and the rights of
all persons are protected by the statute as
to damages, if any. from such proceeding,
and any provisions of the character
named would be to render nugatory the
object of the bill."
The Committee on Finance and Audit
ing reported that they could not find out
how the City and County could order and
pay for improvements under the plan pro
posed by Labor Exchange Branch No. 26.
The ax swung only once. Charles Wil
son lost t lie position of janitor in the Re
ceiving Hospital and Charles Whelan was
appointed to take his place.
' It was decided to refer to the Street
Committee the report in favor of discon
tinuing tbe issue of permits for private
contracts for such work after March 1.
The Superintendent of Streets, was in
structed to make a guarantee for five
years a part of the contract for the repay
ing of Geary street, between Kearny and
Powell. This was one of the measures
favored by the Merchants' Association.
Another measure favored by that organ
ization upon which favorable action was
taken was a recommendation that three
s'reet-crossings be paved with asphalt,
brick and cobbles, property-owners to pay
one-halt the cost, the total cost not to ex
ceed 22 cents per square foot The Street
Superintendent was also instructed to pro
ceed to remove obstructions from certain
streets in the neighborhood of the Pre
sidio, to which General Forsyth some
t me ago called attention, claiming that
the City was not fulfilling the conditions
under which the land was granted to tbe
City by Congress. .. -':'.''
Supervisor Shcehan was appointed a
member of the Judiciary Committee, vice
Supervisor Rottanzi. ' '_. ;"
The customary annual resolution mak
ing provision for the collection of delin
quent taxes was adopted. Alfred Fuhr
man was named as special counsel to col
lect the taxes. -.â â -â â -
Resolutions were' finally passed award

FOR UNEMPLOYED
The Citizens' Relief Commit
tee Has Adopted This
Plan.
[nteod to Raise Much More
. Money to Continue Im
. provements.
Loads of Food Collected Yesterday.
â¢ Men Opposed to Salvation
Army.
The boulevard will be built to cive
tvork to the * unemployed. This was
iecided yesterday forenoon at a meet
ing in the Merchants' Association rooms
">f the relief committee appointed by
Mayor Phelan.
Efforts will be made to raise a large sum
*Â»f;money, not $.0,000 nor $100,000 espe
cially, but as much as possible in order to
provide further work than that contem
plated upon the boulevard.
A committee, consisting of Con O'Con
nor, Engineer Schnssler and Henry
J. Crocker, was appointed to see about ob
taining right of way deeds from property
owners along the line of the proposed
boulevard. This will be only a matter of
form, as most of the owners are Heartily
in favor of the Improvement.
Tne Spring Valley Water Company has
offered away through its land. Ex-Major
Sutro, who is one of the fathers of the
plan, will give a way through his land.
T.he boulevard will begin at Seventh aye-
Hue t near the Olympic Club grounds, and
thence ' will be buiit southward round
toward San Mateo County.
Contractor Tuttle said that his appur
tenances might be used free o" charge to
t.he unemployed and that he would also
contribute $100 worth of team work toward
the* boulevard.
Mayor Phelan suggested that this work
should be furnished only to the unem
ployed, who nave been in this City three
months. This would prevent an influx of
unemployed from other cities. Tne com
mittee adopted his suggestion, but de
cided not to make a casttron rule that
would work au injustice.
, Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald thought
that the employment 01 1000 men would
relieve the present distress.
â¢â¢Daniel Meyer of 216 Post street was
chosen, treasurer of the citizens' relief
committee, and he will receive funds in
tended for the boulevard work and other
schemes to be projected for the general
employ of the men now out o. work.
'â¢* Erpveii hundred men were fed yesterday
&* the headquarters of the unemployed ou
.Howard street, near New Montgomery.
â  â¢ There are 2000 names already on the
rolls of the organized unemployed in this
City. The leading spirits among these
men argue that a fund of $20,000 raised to
build a boulevard would practically fur
nish work for 2000 men only five days.
Then the present condition would be felt
again. Boulevard wot k would amount to
temporary relief unless it could be fol
lowed by other employment.
Yesterday evening after the second meal
of the* day Was served the fund of the un
employed amounted to $8 in cash.. There
were, However, provisions of one kind and
airotfter enough for perhaps two or three
â¢.lays longer. V--7-
Since the "organization was perfected
about two weeks a-o, it has spent $335 60,
for every cent of which there are vouchers.
This, togettier with the little money on
hand, is ail the cash that the unemployed
have rece ved. The major part of the
motley was a check for $250 from Mayor
Phelan for their immediate relief and a
large part of it was spent on 10-cent meal
tickets 'at the rate of about $60 a day.
The rent of th.- present headquarters was
als.o paid for iv advance for one month;
it was $75.
In the forenoon yesterday nearly 300 of
the unemployed termed a procession and
marched from their headquarters round
through Davis, Drumm, Main and Wash
ington streets drawing a wagon and solic
iting material contributions from the dif
ferent wholesale provision merchants.
They succeeded in filling thei*.* wagon with
packages of rolled oats, flour, potatoes,
beans and small groceries, and got also
$7 in cash.
' ' In addition to all these thing* they were
given a whole wagon-load o: green peas, a
contribution from Campodonico & Co.,
and another wagon-load of bread, cakes
and pies â in fact," the whole contents ot a
bakery â bought up and sent to them by
Walter Morosco, the theatrical manager.
Various assertions have been made
relative to the kind of workingmen com
posing the present unemployed. The of
ficers of the organization have not at
tempted to obtain. any list of the trades
and crafts represented, for* the men tnem
e**lv_s want work of any kind and do not
wish to assert their preferences.
A representative of" The Call' yesterday
inquired the occurjation of just a hundred
men advancing in ; line on the kitchen.
T htf result should J furnish a fair basis for
estimating the percentage of the different
classes of workmen represented in the
whole organization.
â  /'lt -hows that nearly 60 per cent of the
unem played are men of some trade; that
about 30 per cent are common laborers;
and that the remaining 20 per cent have
knowledge of some special kind of labor.
/Here is the percentage for 100 repr<
Â«: alive men among .the unemployed:
** .aooiers, 6 cooks, 5 gardeners, 5 hostlers,
CVjearasters, 5 miners, 5 carpenters, 3 wait
er-, ',', machinists, 2 blacksmiths, 2 iron
workers, 2 plumbers, 2 shipping clerks, 2
bookkeener--, 2 porters, 2 painters, 1 decor
ator and painter, 1 decorator and polisher,
1 marble poliÂ«her. 1 barber, 1 marine en
gineer, 1 locomotive engineer, 1 fireman,
1 steamfitter, 1 brick mason, 1 paper
badger, 1 cabinetmaker, 1 molder, 1 shoe
maker, 1 miller. 1 hoopmaker, 1 confec
tioner, 1 prcs-man, 1 salesman and
.canvasser, 1 kitchen helper, 1 sailor, 1
aeronaut. '/*7.7. A Â .
.â¢ This will' furnish an idea of what the
unemployed are who now wish work of
any kind. Some of them are married and
some have families to support.
â¢A socialistic feeling prevails among the
â¢leatjers. To it partly may be attributed
-sentiments that have been expressed.
0 ie makes the men opposed to the mere
proposition of work at a dollar a day. â 
They want $2 a day, on the assumption
-it. at as citizens desirous of maintaining
their lespeclability and earning a living
â¢ they should not be offered a pittance that
* -all depreciate the value of labor here.
The other mages them opposed to the
methods of the Salvation Army in its re
lief movements.
. They object to tbe Salvation Army be
cause it charges 5 cents for a .meal or a
bed instead of freely furnishing either to
a deserving perron. Several of those that
applied at the Salvation Army kitchen
just round the corner on New Montgom
ery street declined to do work equivalent
to the value of a meal. They consider
such a method degrading to deserving
lafcor not in search of charity, but willing
tof accept temporary relief until paying
employment is obtained.
To-day the Salvation Army will open a
woodyard, where a limited amount of
work can be furnished to about 100 men,'
Each man may work an hour and get a
meal ticket or a bed ticket. The idea is
not to ' 'ucnish a solution of the problem
of the unemployed, but simply to relieve
temporary suffering. â  .-. .
All the' Salvation' Army organizations
are run so that each may support itself
independently of the other. Trie Salvation
ists' parades in this City on Washington's
birthday, contrary to the suppositions of
the unemployed, who yesterday regretted
it as a use of good money on -fireworks
and a street display, cost less than $10,
according to the statement of the officers
who had charge of it. The red fire and
the letters of tire cost only a dollar. The
trucks were loaned. Only the horses had
to be rented. Metropolitan Temple for the
evening cost $30. But the parade was a
means of filling the hall and a subscrip
tion of $100 was taken up. So the cele
bration proved a profitable investment.
A wrong impression has been gained of
the Salvation Army and its objects by the
unemployed. They look upon its neat
uniforms and its charges for meals as an
indication of commercial profit made from
charitable work.
The common soldiers of the Salvation
Army, explained one of the higher officers
yesterday, receive nothing for their ser
vices. They are engaged in various em
ployments, and even help to pay the ex
penses of the army work. The officers de
vote their whole time to the army and are
barely supported by it, the idea being that
as Christians they wish nothine moie. A
lieutenant-colonel is allowed $14 a week
for the living expenses of himself and wife
provided funds are available; if not he
gets less, but never more. A major, if
married, is limited to $14 a week; an ad
jutant or staff captain to $12 a week; an
ensign to $10 50 a week; a captain to $10 a
week. Ail these are the maximum
amounts allowed for the living and main
tenance of man and wife. A single man
gets about a third less. A girl captain is
limited to $6 a week, a single lieutenant to
$6 a week and a woman lieutenant to $5
lor every expense of life. ;v.> -*Â»

SHOT AT MR. O'CONNOR
The Crazy Deed of a Drunken
Man Who Had Imaginary
Grievances.
Eugene Jones, Janitor cf the Horace
Mann School Attacked the
Principal.
The teachers and pupils of the Horace
Mann School on Valencia street, near
Twenty-second, came hear losing their
principal Joseph O'Connor on Thursday
last. [JU'J
The particular thing creating excite
ment in connection with Mr. O'Connor is
that the janitor of the Horace Mann
School, "Eugene T. Jones, did bis utmost
to assassinate the principal last Thursday
afternoon.
Jones, who is one of the newly ap
pointed employes of the Board of Educa
tion, assumed his duties about a month
ago. He was regularly instructed by his
predecessor as to what work he had to do,
and he acquitted himself in the premises
to the satisfiic ion of the teachers until a
couple of weeks ago. He claimed he was
overworked, and he was allowed an as
sistant, wno took charge of one of the
yards and of some of tbe day class rooms*
Complaint- from the teachers came
pourin- la that the night school rooms
especially were being neglected, and Prin
cipal O'Connor informed Jones he most
be more attentive or else a complaint
would be lodged with the Board of Edu
cation.
Jones brooded over tbis, and at 3 o'clock
Thursday afternoon he forced his way
into Mr. O'Connor's private office, where
dome of the teachers were making their
final reports for tha day.
"Come out here and look at those
rooms," he ordered in a manner indicat
ing that drink had control of him.
"I will not do so," answered the princi
pal, "and what is more, I don't want yon
to come in here in that manner, especi
ally when your breath smells so strongly
of whisky."
"You are a liar!" exclaimed the jani
tor. "I'm not drinking, and if you say
so, yon lie." >: -.7
Mr. O'Connor closed the door on the
fellow and went along attending' to the
teachers, who were terribly frightened.
" At 5 o'clock that afternoon, when Mr.
O'Connor was leaving the school building
Jones encountered him in the hallway
and insisted again that the schoolrooms
be inspected. -J--W
The principal was anxious to leave the
place to attend to other business and he
was particularly desirous of having noth
ing to dowitn Jones, who was inflamed
by liquor aud an idea that he was being
abused.
* As Mr. O'Connor opened the door to
step out of the building Jones drew a pis
tol from his pocket and pointing it at
bJm pulled the trigger. The weapon, al
though loaded, was not "cocked." Being
a single-action pistol the repeated pulling
at the trigger by the drunken janitor
failed to explode it.
Professor O'Connor, who is a powerful
man, could easily have reached his would
be assassin and disarmed him but that he
is suffering at this time from a painful
accident he met with while exercising a
couple of weeks ago in Sausalito.
Mrs. Jones," the wife of the drunken
janitor, who had . been evading him for
some hours for fear of his frenzy, rushed
in and grabbed tbe pistol, be -ging him all
the while to stopâ that Mr. O'Connor had
not done him barm.
Between the two the frenzied janitor
was disarmed and sent home. *
â¢ Yesterday Detective Cody arrested
. Jones on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon and be was subsequently released
by Judge Conlan on bonds in the sum of
$1000.
The story reached the Board of Educa
tion, and . Eugene â T. Jones â¢ has ' been
stricken from the list of school house jani
tors.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1897.
GEORGE W. PARSONS, Vice-President for California of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at Omaha.
BATTLING FOR THE
MARSHALSHIP
Sheriff McKenzie Has the
Prize Almost in
Hand.
He Tells of His Strong Support
From Many Different
Sources.
The District aa Enornnas One,
Reaching From Fresno to the
Oregon L'.ne.
Sheriff George 8. McKenzie of Napa
County, who is tusking a formidable fight
for the United States marshalship of the
northern district of California, to succeed
Barry Baldwin, was among the arrivals
here yesterday. Of course it is considered
tbat Mr. Baldwin will not aspire to suc
ceed himself under a Republican adminis
tration.
. The Sheriff of Napa, who has arrested
so many stage- robbers and other bad men
during his official career, believes tbat he
has an excellent show to get the office.
He apparently has lots of people working
tor him, and with enthusiasm; too. From
what is learned at different sources he
seems to have an open roadstead to the
prize.
Il is an important office and holds sway
over a vast area of country. A good
many deputies are required, but as at
present they are appointed under civil
service rules, no great pull can be made
on a candidate for the marshalship. Still
it is said that with these and other offices
under other departments an effort is to be
made to make them partisan as before, on
the plea that as good men may be ob
tained in the party as out of it.
Sheriff Mckenzie is at tbe Grand. lie
said in regard to the campaign be is mat
ing for the United States marshalship: '
"I have about seven-tenths of the Re
publican county committees of the whole
northern district, and I also have the in
dorsement of the Republican members of
the Senate and Assembly from the dis
trict.
"Besides this I have the indorsement of
the State officers, and of the county offi
cers of different counties in the district.
In addition to these a great many of tbe
Republican State Central Committee and
some of the Republican electors, who only
SHERIFF GEORGE S. McKENZIE of Napa, Who Will Probably
Ec United States Marshal for the Northern District of
California.
iSketclud fron.Ufsaabua "Call" artisLX ;
recently cast the vote of California for
Major McKinley, are my supporter.-."
"What about your support in Congress?"
was asked.
"Well, some in Congress are friendly to
me, too," he said, with a smile.
The Sheriff seemed very well satisfied
with the number and kind of frienos he
bad. He considered them, he said, the
strongest in th*- Republican party. Talk
ing of the extent of the district, he said :
* "What is called the Northern District of
California extends from the northern line
of Fresno County to Oregon, taking the
whole of the upper portion of the State.
It Is a very large territory, of coarse."
It is said that Senator Perkins is one of
Sheriff McKenzie's supporters at Wash-"
ington. Tne Sheriff says he is not going
to the inaugural.
BILLS FOR JURORS' LUNCH.
One Committee of the Supervisors Not
Approving Another Committee
Will Consider Them.
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, of which Supervisor Smith
l is chairman, yesterday succeeded in hav
ing the controversy concerning the feed
ing of jurors in criminal cases at the ex
pense of the City and Connty turned over
to the Committee on Finance, of which
Dr. Rottanzi is the chairman.
The bills for certain jurors' dinners have
been before the Supervisors some time.
: The Supervisors resolved not to pay any
l such bills after February 1. Last 'week
the Judiciary Committee failed to approve
bills which were sent down from Judge
â¢ Cook's department, and tbe board yester
day transferred them to the Finance
j Committee. Dr. Rottanzi says he does not
! see how he can "approve of the bills until
j the Judiciary Committee has passed upon
: their legality. IfiflK.
Whether the Finance Committee will
i pass them around to another committee
remains to be seen. In the meantime the
i question is open whether jurors bad not
' better bring along well-stocked hampers
: when they are on duty in long cases.
D. J. ROONEY LAID AWAY.
Yesterday the Body Was Deposited in
the Fair Family Vault at
Holy Cross.
The late D. J. Rooney, who in life was
so well known in and around the mining
camps of the Pacific Slope, yesterday
fouud a restin .--place beside his sister,
, Mrs. Theresa Fair, in the family vault at

unostentatious in the extreme. Rev.

nounced tbe committal service at the vault.

from Angels Camp, a little mining camp

CALIFORNIA TO
SHOW AT OMAHA
Party Coming From the
East to Awaken Local
Interest.
President Wattles and Manager
Hitchcock Will Visit
Sacramento.
Vice-President G.orge W. Parsons
Furnishes Some Fact. Conc?rn
ing the Exposition.
'â¢7 _r _....-
George W. Parsons, vice-president for
California of the Trans- Mississippi and
International Exposition at Omaha, to
tago place next year from June to Novem
ber, has received a dispatch from Â£. C.
Hunt, superintendent of promotion, in
forming him that Manager Hitchcock,
President Wattles and other prominent
Omaha citizens will visit Sacramento.
Their purpose is to confer with legislators
in reference to the appropriation to have
California represented. The dispatch is in
full as follows: *"-.<*,';.
Omaha, Nebr., February 18, 1897.
Hon. George VV. Parsons: Committee of promi
nent OniMi'ia citizen--, headed by President
Wattles and Mannger Hitchcock, accompanied
I by their wives, will arrive at Sacramento next
i week on * special car to present exposition
matter. Arrange for joint cession 01 Legisla
ture if possible and It not have a meeting of a
joint committee of both houses. Have papers
announce coming. Have the Governor co
operate. Legislatures and cities thus far
visited have accorded handsome reception
â nd every courtesy. It gives the project a
decided impetus. Will wire time of a. rival as
soon as possible. . ' E. C. Ht***t,
Superintendent Department of Promotion.
Mr. Parsons said la%t evening that he
considered that it will be of much impor
tance to California to be represented. He
also explained at length the facts concern
ing the Omaha exposition;*'
'â¢It is the outgrowth," said Mr. Parsons,
"of the trans-Mississippi cons-res*. The
exposition will represent directly all the
States and Territories west of the Missis-
I sippi River. The remainder of the coun
try will be invited to take part, but the
exposition will be distinctively Western.
"The sense of the eighth trans-Missis
sippi congress was that such an exposition
would be of great advantage to the West.
In fact, the vote was unanimously in fa
vor of it. The trans-Mississippi congress
is a very representative oody, embracing
many eminent men.
"The claims of the country west of tbe
Mississippi to have a distinctive exposi
tion are well based. Two-thirds of the
area of the United States lies west of the
Mississippi, and that area contains one
third of the population and one-half of
the wealth of the entire country.
"The Eastern States bad their chance
for exploitation at Philadelphia in 1876.
Tne central part of the United States was
advertised at Chicago. The South had
the Atlanta Exposition and also the
Cotton-growers' Exhibition at New Or
leans. The West has never had a distinct
exhibition. Omaha, which was Selected
as the site, is the gateway to both the
East and the West. Within a radius of
500 miles, taking Omaha as a center, a
circle would touch fifteen States and
Territories, in which reside 20,000,000 per-.
sons. If only 10 per cent of thc-a should
attend, the gathering would be very large.
''California certainly should be well
represented. The United States Govern
ment has recognized the importance of
the exposition. The sum of $200,001) has
been appropriated and a bill is pending
before Congress asking for $300,000 more.
The bill appropriating $50,000 pending at
Sacramento is out of the Assembly and on
its third reading in the Senate."
The articles of incorporation define more
fully the purposes to be the holding of an
exposition of ail the products, industries
and civilization of the States and Terri
tories of the United States of America
west of the Mississippi River, and also
such exhibits as may be provided by the
United States or any State in the United
States, or any foreign country, for the
purpose particularly of exhibiting to tbe
world the products,* industries and capa
bilities generally of the said States and
Territories west of the Mississippi River.

THE JURY STOOD
SEVEN TO ONE
First of the Chinese Gam
bling Cases Slips a
Cog.
The Defense Rests Upon the
Articles of Incorporation of
the Club
Objection Raised by . the Defense to
Every Question Pot to the
Witnesses.
The first of the cases arising, out of the
big raid made by the police on the so
called Chinese clubs on Saturday night,
February 13, came up tor trial before a
jury in Judge Joachimsen's court yester
day afternoon.
The venire of forty was exhausted and
only, eight jurors bad been selected.
Rather than suffer the delay of issuing
another venire, , it was agreed on both
sides to try the case with the eight jurors.
Yee Chee was the defendant. -He was
arrested by Sergeant Harper and posse at
823 Washington street, and was charged
with visiting a tan game. He was repre
sented by Attorneys Joseph V. Coffey and
J. F. Smith. Ex-Judge Louderback con
ducted the prosecution.
S-rgeant Harper was tbe first witness
called. *He testified ' to raiding the place
and finding the defendant there. He
seized sticks, coins, bags and other articles
used in a tan, game, which were produced
and shown to the jurors. 7
Attorney Coffey objected "â  to every ques
tion put to tbe witness in something like
the following: â¢".',"
.*: "l object to the question as immaterial
and misleading; calls tor the opinion of
the witness and is not tbe best evidence.
. "Objection overruled.
"Exception.. â¢
"Exception noted."
~ Then after the question was answered
Attorney Coffey would say:
"I move to strike out the answer of the
witness. * V'VV v *
"Motion denied.
j "Exception. ',
J : *? 'Exception noted."
.Three policemen corroborated Sergeant
Harper und the prosecution rested.
The defense simply placed in evidence
the articles of Incorporation of the club.
Ex-Judge Louderback made an admira
ble address to the jury, contending that
the evidence. clearly showed tbat a tan
me was being played at the time the
laid was made, which, according to the
law, was an illegal game. The fact that
the club was incorporated did not permit
its members to violate the law. .
Neither of the attorneys for the defense
addressed the jury and af.er the Judge
had instructed them they retired to con
sider their verdict at half-past 5 o'clock.
Three-quarters of .an hour la:er they came
into court and the foreman announced
that they could not possibly agree. They
were accordingly discharged.
It was ascertained that seven were for
conviction and one for acquittal.
The case was continued until to-day,
when a date will be . fixed ' for the second
trial.

turns), which are usually made on Monday, came
to hand early this morning. The visible supply 1
was finally got about the middle of the session,
and 'while the different points Included In the
showing wer. reporting, wheat prices were af
fected by the increases and decreases. Ihe open
ing of the wheat market was easy and low on
slight decline, which was due apparently to an ad
vance of one point in English loiuols and to a de
cline in wheat prices at Liverpool. The advance
of consols was taken to Indicate a more peaceful
feeling In Europe.
The world's shipments of wheat last week were
â¼cry small at 3,265.000 bushels. The amount on
ocean passage deceased 1,280,000 bushels and
the English visible supply Increased 1.386.000 '

CO â Trading In corn to-day was attended
with more interest than has accompanied It for
some ilme The extremely heavy exports of last
week, together with a comparatively small In
terior movement, entered Into const leration In de
termining the tone of the market and the value of
the grain. Combined with these factors there was
for a time a very firm wheat market which aiJed
corn. Receipts were 236 cars. There were no
withdrawals from store. Tbe visible supply in
creased 2.019,000 bushels and the amount on
ocean passage show, d a gain of 1 ,'BOO.OOO bush-Is.

S Co.BIG VALUE OF A
PISTOL PERMIT
Granted* by Mayor Davie
'â . to a Man Returning
to Italy.
Frank Angeli Was Taken in
Italy for an American
0 ficial.
Judge Wood Highly Amused at the
Stofy Told by the turned
v Tray l.r.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Feb. 23. J
F/ank Angeli returned from Italy yes
terday and told Judge Wood this morning
a most remarkable story of the effect on
Italian officials of an Oakland permit to
carry a revolver.
..A few months ago Angeli wanted to re
turn home and visit his native land. He
seemed 'to have the idea that all manner
pf difficulties requiring heroic settlement
might be met with between California
and sunny Italy. He told his troubles to
Judge Wood and asked for permission to
- carry a revolver. Angeli was told that as
soon as he got outside the city limits the
v permit would avail him nothing. But he
persisted in his request.
Judge Wood took him to Mayor Davie
and explained the situation, and to satisfy
him a permit was given him which was
signed by the Mayor and the Judge. An
geli went to Italy and returned a couple
of days ago. He went to Judge Wood and
told the following tale:
"I had no difficulty about a passport,"
said Angeli; "wherever 1 went I showed
-my permit, and it was at once accepted.
Customs officials looked at it, and after
reading it bowed most politely to me and
made it appear as though it were a per
sonal favor of me to pass on and not re
quire them to search my trunks or ask me
lor other papers. When 1 got home every
body examined this piece of paper, and at
once I noticed that they thought I was a
very prominent man. I did not under
stand why this was so, and think the
Judge and the Mayor must have made a
.mistake and given mesometningelse than
a permit to carry a pun. I cannot read
the English on my papÂ»r, but I had some
one write it for me in Italian."
â¢*â â¢' being greatly interested in the man's
sti.ry, Judge Wood and the Mayor care
fully examined the permit to-day and
found that Angeli. in order to have mat
ters straight and avoid any possible diffi
culty, had requested a friend who could
.read English to write on the back the fact
that it was attested by the Mayor and the
: Police Judge. The frien^l, either for a
; juke, or through ignorance, had written
something which made it appear that
' An_eli was the Mayor and Police Judge
â  Of the city of Oakland, and on this show
.ing he- appears to have received many
-faVors". Neither Judge Wood nor the
. Mayor is yet able to explain why a permit
.* ty carry a pistol in Oakland should have
been considered of any value, even with
.'an Italian indorsement, outside its boun
daries, but Ange'i was evidently telling
â¢' tin* truth, and Hie oiliciais consider that
the joke is one of the best yet reported.
;; : .-NEW ATHLETIC COMPACT. |
"When Ratified Will Go Into Effectâ The
Field Day.
."BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 23.â A new
compact to govern athletic contests b3
tWeen Stanford University and the Uni
versity of California until January 1, 1900.
has been drawn up by representative ath
letes of botn institutions, and will, upon
; ratification by the executive committees
of the Palo Alto and the Berkeley student
bodies, go into operation for the present
seaon.
This year's very important intercollegi
ate field day will take place in this city on
April 17.
- In addition to the set rules formulated,
tbe committees discussed and expressed
opinions on other athletic matters affect
- ing intercollegiate snort The University
of Caliiornia representative- suggested
the propriety of doing away with Eastern
fodtball coaches, but Stanford saw no
good reason for changing the present plan,
and there the matter was left.
Stanford's three representatives at this
conference, which was held at the Uni
versity Club on Saturday evening, were
Football Captain and present Senior-
Class President Charles M. Fickert, who
was chairman of the meeting; ex-Football
Manager, ex-Track Captain and present
.Track Manager Dave E. Brown, and
â¢â¢Heff" Williams, the Varsity center rush.
Berkeley's three representatives were
Professor George C. El wards; ex-Football
Manager and ex-Varslty-Tackle George F.
Rei.nnardt, who acted as secretary of the
meeting, and ex-Track Captain and Foot
ball Manager-elect Everett Brown, a
brother of Stanford's star mile runner,
and a mile runner himself.
This committee recommended that
"When circumstances permit there shall
.be an annual intercollegiate boat race."
The wording of tbis recommendation is
plainly a victory for Stanford inasmuch
as Berkeley had continually demanded
tat her rival come to time with a crew,
liie the Palo Alto men have auietly
serted that conditions at present mate
. a t- racing an impossibility for Stanford.
Three special amendments were made
to the football agreement. The annual
freshman intercollegiate mate.i is to be an
'established event. The list of contestants

WAIT TO RECONSIDER.
Are Politics Overshadowed by
the Sunday - Closing
Question ?
Frickstad-'s Attempt to Undermine
Thomas Has Acted as a Boom*
.ran;.
Oakland Office Sau Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 23. J
The fight over the closing of the saloons
on Sunday is now the most important
feature in politics. Bo intense has become
the feeling over thi. question that every
thing else is subordinated to it, and any
candidate who will uncompromisingly
declare than he is in favor of Sunday
closin., and will so vote, could certainly
command an enormous block of votes.
Ex-President Walter G. Manuel, one of
those who voted against submitting the
question to the people alter promising to
do so, pubiisbod a long letter to-day in
which he made some replies to tbe min
isters' severe criticisms of last Sunday,
and declares bis willingness if a special
meeting of the Council be called to change
his vote and let tbe people decide the
matter. Mr. Manuel's explanation is in a
great measure a vindication of his action,
and he declares that he had no idea that
so many people wanted the question sub
mitted to tbem, otherwise he would cer
tainly have favored it.
He declares that he has been grossly
misrepresented from tbe pulpits and that
his record during four years should be
considered.
Manuel has asked President Mott to
call a special meeting of the Council in
order to reconsider the question, but Mr.
Mott has not yet consented to do no. It
is reported this afternoon that the Pro
testant ministers will hold a meeting at
once and discuss the methods which it is
considered advisable to pursue in their
campaign against the saloons.
It was reported that the ministers would
at this mcc ing support Captain Thomas
for Mayor, but this statement is prema
ture, as no such decision has been ar
rived at.
During the past week a circular signed
by T. C. Frickstadt and addressed to the
voters of Oaklaud has been freely circu
lated and sent to the newspaper offices,
containing an attack upon Captain W. R.
Thomas, Republican candidate for Mayor.
The story is that of an old real estate deal
and has been amply refuted on every pos
sible occasion during the past lour years.
There was some trouble at the time be
tween Frickstadt and Thomas, and at
Frickstadt's request it was mutually
agreed to leave the matter to a committee
of his own selection, . who reported that
after as exhaustive an investigation as
possible they unhesitatingly exonerated
Messrs. Benham and Thomas, and this
opinion was concurred in years ago by
Judge Havens, Frickstadt's attorney.
Under these circumstances common de
cency would have suggested that Frick
stadt should have let the matter rest, es
pecially as he himself sustained all that
Mr. Thomas had said by placing the
property on the market under precisely
the same conditions under which it was
represented to him.
This underhand attempt to injure the
Republican candidate has helped rather
than hurt Captain Thomas' cause..
The Republican City Central Commit
tee hat indorsed Gl es H. Gray to nil the
vacancy for School D rector caused by the
resignation of Dr. McMullin. Mr. Gray
will not appear on the ticket as the Re
publican candidate, as it is too late to
make the change, but the fact will be
borne in mind that every vote for Dr. Mc-
Mullin is wasted. 7 â
The Portuguese Central Republican Club

An effort is being made to-night to se
cure sufficient signatures to a call lor a
special meeting of tho City Council on
Thursday evening. It is the desire oi some
of the members who opposed it a week
ago, to now submit the question of Bun
day closing to the voters at the municipal
election. Councilman Brosnahan stated
to-night that the law requiring the clerk
to begin mailing sample ballots ten days
belore tbe election would forestall any
such action. To-morrow is the ten' h day
before March 2 and Clerk Tompkins is
compelled by law to begin the mailing of
sample ballots before night.

The aeronaut is charged by Robert

Aeronaut Ear!ston and His Wife, Who Claim They Have Been
Driven From Their Home.
latter's house. The warrant was , served
on Earlston and he now replies with a
story that Smith recently ran away with
tbe wife of bis uncle and that he ordered
him to leave the home in East Oakland
because he (Earlston) did not countenance
tbe action and was in sympathy with the
husband whom Smith is said to have de
ceived. ,i;- ; *'. : v v - # *v Â».'"â ? ;."..*' . . . â¢
Earlston declares that he never used a
pistol in his arguments with Smith, al
though tbe latter has sworn to a warrant
on that ground.
"I married Smith's sister," said Earl
ston, "and soon afterward 1 asked him to
come and live with me. The home in
East Oakland is my own and no mother
in-law bas a claim on it, as Smith de
clares. I was glad to have him there un
til he went to Rio Vista and came back
with a wife. Neither myself nor wife have
ever seen the woman before, but we
thought nothing wrong about it until I
happened to run across Thomas Smith
and learned that his wife was in my bouse.
I went home and asked Smith to leave. I
did so in a gentlemanly way, ana he
talked back, declining to do as I ordered,
so I grabbed him, intending to throw him
out. He begged off and said he would
leave as soon as he could.
"He went right down to the. Justices'
court and swore out a warrant for roe, and
now tbe court has forbidden me to visit
my own home until the matter is settled.
Smith is still there and I suppose the aunt
from Rio Vista is also there, and when the
case comes to trial I will have no difficulty
in proving my innocence."
Smith declares that the house is his and
that Earlston bad not been behaving him
self and *-Â»" ordered to leave. A few
months ago Earlston, who had only been
married a few weeks, left his young wife
and for a time she did not know where he
was. Sbe told a pitiful story of desertion
and much sympathy was shown for ber.
and it was not known until this case came
up that the aeronaut bad returned.
He made a record last summer by his
many ascensions at Blair Park and Ban
Lorenzo, and more than once the effect of
the ascension was considerably height
ened by the fainting of bis wi.e, who used
to swoon just when her husband was do
ing his horizontal-bar trick before leaving
the balloon in his parachute.

OAKLAND'S NEW ENGINE-HOUSE.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Feb. 23.â The first of the handsome new engine-hou.-es that
are to be built is nearly ready for occupancy on Sixth street It is a brick struc
ture and contains all the appliances and conveniences of a modern -fire-engine
house. All the engine houses in the city are old wooden structures, and many of
them are unfit for habitation by the firemen. One or two new brick: and stone
houses will be included in the estimate each year until all have been rebuilt. '^ ; '
nev Per.-ol bas passed upon the deeds of
the various portions of land for the West
Oakland park site and after few minor
changes are made ii is expected they will
be signed to-morrow and the purchase
price paid by the Board of Public Woaks.
SUPERVISORS FALL . OUT.
Tliey Totally lenore the Chairman or
the Hospital Committee
OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 23.â bar
mony that has distinguished the new
Board of Supervisors was most rudely
broken to-day. The matter came to a
crisis over a discussion regarding rules for
the government of the hospital. â â  : "< .'-Y.v ':
A set of new rules was read by the clerk,
and Mr. I-oetb, who was chairman of the
Hospital Committee, demanded to know
who prepar.d them. Mr, Church stated
that they were prepared by the physician,
upon which Mr. Roeth declared that it
was a matter belonging to the Hospital
Committee and that he did not intend to
be ignored. Mr. Wells was of the opinion
that tbe physician understood the needs
of the hospital and snould control it,
whereupon Mr. Roeth said that the new
rules were an effort to cover up matters in
the hospital which the public should
know. The object of it, he declared, is to
shut out reporters and to take from the
steward the maintenance of the place.
Mr. Church said: "I am not playing to
the gallrrv as Roeth is, and any one who
says that I am trying to cover up anything
tells a willful falsehood."
On the vote being taken the rules were
adopted, Roeth being the only dissenter.
Viewing the Proposed Lines.
OAKLAND. Cat., Feb. 23.â The execu
tive committee of the annexation com
mittee made a circuit of the proposed ad-
dition yesterday and met with many re
quests to take in additional property. The
explanation of this lies in the fact, tbat
they believed that if they were not taken
in tbey would be compelled to form, a
sanitary district. The committee started
at 10 a. m. and made the trip by 3 p. m
The course taken was as follows:
Beginning at San Pablo avenue and narrow
gauge railroad, thence to the junction of the
town of Emeryville, and T- mescal Creek,
thence north to the town of Berkeley, thence
along the line of the Adeline Sanitary District,
through lower Claremont, across to Broadway
to Piedmont, along the western line of the
ceiiu-ter.es, ending their trip at Linda Vista.
On Wednesday evening a meeting to fix
the lines, will be held, and it is probable
that in Piedmont the line will divide the
district, leaving out those cios- to the
cemetery who do not want to come in nor
form a sanitary district.
Lieutenant Cobbledick Explains.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 23.â Lieutenant
Cobbledlck of the Boys' Brigade says that
there is no comfltct between Trustee Wat
son of the Eighth-avenne M. E. Church
and Company D. Boys' Brigade, over the
recent flae-rai-ing. Mr. Cobbledick says:
"The official board appointed a commit
tee to confer witb a like committee from
the company, who arranged all the de
tails. One of the church trustees, J. W.
Watson, a competent mechanic, objected
to tbe manner tbe contractor was placing
the pole, and merely insisted that it be
placed in a more substantial position,
which was done without any trouble.
The affair was erroneously reported by an
officer of this company, who had no au
thority to state what be did. Tne best of
feeling prevails between the members of
the company and the church, and the boys
have never tried in any manner to resist
our authorities." . -v.- 1 â¢ ,-7'- '

DITCHED ENGINE
AND SIX CARS
A Bowlder Wrecks a
Freight Train Near
Midway.
Fireman Seymour Badly In
jured â Emp'oyes Nar
rowly E-capsd.
The Heavy Vehicles Roll Over an
Embankment Into the Mud.
Wreckers at Woik
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 23.â The loco
motive and six cars of a freight train
rolled over an embankment and landed in
a ditch twenty-five feet beiow the track,
one mile west of Midway this afternoon.
The cause of the accident was a bowl
der on the track at a road crossing, which
derailed the locomotive, and it pulled
over six cars before the couplings broke.
Fireman C. J. Seymour saved his life by
jumping at a critical moment and was
badly hurt about the head. ' Engineer
Meade escaped through the window of the
cab as the locomotive was rolling down
the embankment, and both men had re
markably narrow escapes.
An extra freight train left West Oakland
this morning bound for Tracy. It con
sisted of eleveft cars, most of them being
empiy. The train did some way business-,
but all went well till Midway was ap
proached. When about one mile this side
of that station, which is between Liver
more and Tracy, the locomotive struck a
bowlder and was instantly derailed.
The train at that time was only going
at a moderate rate of speed, and wbon the
wheels -truck they ran for a little dis
tance b-fore goin â¢ over the embankment.
The locomotive and cab rolled down and
landed in tbe ditch in different direc
tions and the cars piled on top. Six of
the cars, forming the largest . part of the
train, were pulled over into the ditch
before the coupling broke.
The wreckers say that it is one of the
worst messes they have ever tackled, as
the ditch is soft and muddy and the em
bankment at that point is not well fitted
for the heavy forking of the wrecking
crane.
The wreck occurred in the hilly district
beyond lAltamont, The track in this
neighborhood is a successionof curves and
the freight was only makingslow. time, as
on account of the rains the track is soft
and necessitates slow travel.
Engineer Meade says that the bowlder
that caused all the trouble was no bigger
than a child's head and he is surprised
that it was not crushed off the track with
out any one being any the wiser lor it.
"We were going along very cautiously,"
he said. "Tim track at that point is about
twenty-five feet high and it is all curves,
and after heavy rains we always go slowly
and keep a good lookout I knew noth
ing till I felt a bnmp and as soon as 1
threw the lever over the engine began
to wobble.
"The bowlder was on the track on tho
fireman's side. We had not much way on
us, but we forged ahead some after strik
ing, and then the locomotive took a
tumble to the left and rolled over. I hung
on for a moment or two, but seeing bat
another twist might mean being crushed,
I scrambled through the window and got
on to tbe bank. I don't want another ex
perience like that in my lifetime."
Fireman C. J. Seymour is badly cut
about the bead and bruised. He was on
the cab, and as soon as be saw that his
engine was going to tumble over he
jumped on the bank. He narrowly es
caped being crushed beneath the engine,
but scrambled in tbe mud and got out of
the wreck with some cuts on the head and
several bruises. ."â¢ _ ...â  'â¢â¢;;"â¢ 7 '..
Conductor Martin was in the part of the
train that did not leave the track, and be
yond a shaking up he was not hurt.
Brakeman Clark was on the top of one
of toe cars tbat was ditched, and when he
saw that his car was doomed he partly
jumped and partly fell to the bank, and
thus escaped going down with the wreck.
. Some of the boxcars were loaded with
ties, and there were also two fiatcars piled
up with bricks.
All these were pulled down with the en
gine before the coupling broke. Had not
he coupling been broken when it did
there is no doubt but tbat the whole train
would have gone into the ditch.
As soon as tne news of the accident was
sent to the pier the wrecking train was
sent to the wreck, and when it arrived the
crew saw at once that they had a big job
ahead of them.
Everything was in a heap and the loco
motive was partly on its side and partly
on end and had sunk quite a distance into
the mud. The six cars were badly smashed
and were thrown in all directions. They
were so far awny from the track that the
wreckage crane had difficulty in working,
and owing to the manner in which the
wrecked locomotive and cars were lying
it was not easy to recover them.
Up to midnight the wreck had not been
cleared away, and it was reported that the
wrecking train could not po^Bibly com
plete its work at/d return before the morn
ing. After the track had* been cleared
and repaired the passenger trains came
through, although delayed for a few
hours. -â > ;-â 
LONG CAREER OP CRIME.
Coin-Sweater Dickey's Cache Was Dis
covered by a Paper- Carrier.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 23 â S. R. Dickey
and Frederick Bate, the two coin-sweaters
in the County Jail, will be arraigned to
morrow. -V>'>,
Dickey has an interesting history that
has been unearthed by Secret Service
Agent Harris. His family are well-to-do
and own a large ranch near Napa. Last
July a boy who carries papers through
the valley while crossing the Dickey ranch
â aw the prisoner hiding something under
a fence.
The boy concealed himself, and when
the man had gone away he unearthed the
treasure. It proved to be small molds,
and the newsboy took one of them to the
constable of Napa and told him how he
obtained it. Sometime later the con
stable notified Detective Harris.
Meanwhile Dickey had discovered that
his cache had been disturbed, so he dug
up the molds and took them to Secret Ser
vice Agent Harris in San Francisco. He
said he had found them in his field and
that they, probably belonged to a wood
chopper named Virgin, then in Alaska.
Frederick Blite, Dickey's present mate,
is unknown to the Secret Service. Ha
has been living with Dickey for some
t me. Blite is a member of Harmony
Lodge, A. O. U. W., and as such holds a
life insurance policy. He has signed over
ois interest in the policy to D'ckey, on
condition that the fatter .maintain him
during life. Dickey had fulfilled this sin
gular contract* with sweated coin' and
both are now in trouble.
In addition to all this notoriety D'ckey
was in love with "Dr. Addle Swain" of
San Francisco,' but she stated to-day that
ibe love was all on the one side. It is in
timated that Dickey will plead guilty, but
Blite will demand a trial.

Painful diseases are bad enough, hut when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
la no let up to the mental suffering day or

such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until- it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid iv the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general, health, but enlarged "his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
be now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can

SIMMONS FAILED
THE LAST PART
Played for a Good Thing
and Beaten by Good
Times-
Frank X Took Another Race
in a Very Hard Drive
From Elmer F.
Tbe Sinner Led His Field Oat at
OJds of 7 to iâ T_a Rosa Fin
ished ia Last Position-
There was a very nervous feeling in the
betting market previous to one race run
at logleside yesterday. In the third
evÂ«nt, a five and a half furlong dash, with
the scale of weights raised ten pounds
above trie scale, were six starters. Good
Times, with 109 up, looked the most likely
of the lot, and opened up a 6 to 5 favorite.
The odds were no sooner posted against
Simmons than a wild rush was made to
get aboard, the price gradually dropping
from 5 to 2 to 6 to 5, while the odds
against Good Times, which had Cash
Sloan up, lengthened out to 9 to 5. As
the horses were going to the Dost Joe 1311
--man went down tho line on Good Times,
and the wise ones concluded that the big
Chicago bettor had suddenly become
bereft of his reason. The members of the
ring also bantered Joe considerable, but
be soon turned tbe tables, for Good Times
Droved a very gamy lobster. Catching
Simmons fifty yards from the wire, Cash
Sloan gave his mount one cut with the
whip, and, drawing away, he won cleverly
by half a length. Mr. Ullman will proba
bly do tbe joshing to-day when he cashes
his tickets. â :.-â :. *
Another beautiful day greetel race
goers, but tbe attendance looked small
when compared with the immense throng
of the day preceding. Favorites were suc
cessful in but two in.taucee.
W. M. Hurry's gelding, . Nuncomar.
which in previous races bad shown high
turns of speed, was made favorite at odds
of 11 to 5 to win the opening five and a
half furlong .crumble, but ran like many
other favorites the Sacramento horseman
has turned outâ back in the ruck. Thorpe
got Morven, the second choice, away in
iront of the bunch, and although siopoing
badly at the end, he mana. Ed to land bis
mount home a nose before the 20 to 1 out
sider Hazard. Brametta was a fair third.
The seven furlong, selling, run that fol
lowed was annexed by Ed Corrigan'
good sprinter Moylan, which was played
down to 7to 10 favoritism. Midlo at Bto
1 went out at a merry clip, leading to the
paddock, where T. Sloan shook the favor
ite up, and drawing away the first choice,
won cleverly by a head. Cabrillo, the
Second choice, was a bad third.
Fourth on the card was a mile and a
-sixteenth selling race, for which game
Frank X was back d down to a 3 to 5
favorite. The "magnificent old cripple"
won, but only through creat effort. The
15 to 1 outsider, Elmer F, ridden by Pig
gott. managed to torge to the front after
passing the stand and contrived to hold
bis advantage until within a few yards of
the wire, where the first choice, under
Willie Martin's hard urging, came on and
earned decision by a scant head in
1:50%. The Spreckels entry, Foremost,
Unified a good third.
The pretty little filly Tea Rose opened a
13 to 20 favorite in the bettine on the fifth
race, a six-furlong purse affair. She re
teded to 9 io 10, and. after leading to the
ttretcb, died away, finishing absolutely
last. In a mild drive Suiiun downed the
10 to 1 shot Nebula by over a length. The
(Baldwin entry, Naranja, ran a good race,
finishing a close-up third. ,* 7
_Stanfield's sprinter, George Miller, car
ried most of the backing in the last race of
the day, a five and a half furlong spin,
with light welter-weights up. The T.-xas
horse opened a 4 to 5 favorite, receding
later to 11 to 10. He appeared sore and
was never able to g-*t to the front. The
Sinner, at odds of 6 to 1, jumped away in
the lead, and was never canght, winning
ridden out from old Yemen, against

LADIES' DAY AT INGLESIDE.
j A Very Fetching- Card of Seven
Events Arranged for the
Occasion. .
This is "ladies' day" at Ingleside, and a
splendid card of seven well-filled events
has been arranged tor the occasion. As
> usual, special cars will be run for the ac
l commodation of the fair sex.
A special purse hung up for the
youngstersâ Sir William, The Cheat,
Hermoso, Outlay and Napamaxâ to race
for would be a very drawing attraction.
It is understood the trainer of the first
named colt is willing to back him to the
extent of $500 in a five-cornered match.
Cash Sloan rode two winners yesterday,
besides finishing second on Yemens.
Tea Rose bas not the high turn of speed
â be possessed before her sickness, and is
evidently in want of a long rest. \

DEMOLISHED THE ENGINE.
An Odd Proceeding in Court Has a Very
Unexpected Seqnel.
There was a very amusing scene in Jus
tice of the Peace Barry's court last week,
which has had a resulting sequel not any
less peculiar. Joseph Holler sued Fer
dinand Hir-ch and Â£. Â£. Hicks to recover
a gas engine. The engine was sent to
Hirsch to repair, and he claimed that for
the repairs the sum of $205 was due him.
The testimony brought Hicks, who is a
physician, into the case. His connection
with it is not a part of the story. The
principal witness was Hirsch, who is
deaf. It was during the taking of his tes
timony that one of the most unusual epi
sodes was developed. There were three
lawyers in the room, and each took a turn
shouting In one ear or the other of Hirsch,
according as they thought they had dis
covered his " soft" ear. The effect must
have been somewhat astounding. Finally
the efforts of the two lawyers were cen
tered on one ear.
One lawyer snouted questions into this
ear and the other lawyer stood a foot dis
tant and yelled in stentorian tones: "I
object 1 I object!"
Apparently the objections might just as
well have been shouted at the fleets of the
powers off Canea, for Hirsch did not hear.
S.i while one lawyer yelled the other
shook his fist to indicate his objections.
The outcome of this odd trial was that
judgment was given by Justice Barry for
the plaintiff. Since this it appears that
Hirsch has demolished the engm- which
was the basis of the suit. When viewed
by the plaintiff it was a mass of frag
ments.

SCHUSSLER SAYS THE WATER COMPANY MUST GET FAIR RATES
-
Otherwise He Informs Mayor Phelan They May Appeal to a More Powerful
TribunalâCertain Previous Valuations, He Contends, Were
Not Capably Undertaken.
COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSES MAINS,
- METERS AND HYDRANTS AND EXAMINES
THE WATER COMPANY'S MAPS.
Dr. Clinton Was Forced to Amend an Earlier Resolution and
Make the Appointment of Exp ..-rts Subject to
the Board's Approval.
Mayor Phelan was absent when the .
Board of Supervisors met last night to
continue the water rates investigation,
and Dr. Rottanzi was thereupon appointed j
to preside. Chief Engineer Schnssler and j
Attorney Kellogg were both in attend
ance, and the former was again called
upon, somewhat later in the evening, to
give evidence, but before this stage was
reached the board indulged in some pre
liminary discussion.
"What is your pleasure, gentlemen,"
queried Dr. Rottanzi.
Dr. Clinton said he wished to offer
another resolution in place of that which
was adopted at the previous meeting, i
relative to the employment of experts, j
Jin the latter resolution the word "board" j
had been used instead of "committee." J
.The present resolution was as follows:
Resolved, That the committee on water and j
water supply, if deemed necessary in its judg
ment, is hereby authorized and empowered to
â "employ an expert accountant to examine and
report upon the books and accounts of the j
Spring Valley Water Works Company, and if )
deemed expedient said committee is further
empowered to employ an engineer or corps of
engineers to examine into the works and
sources of supply of said Spring Valley Water
Works, the sources utilized in supplying the
City and County and the capacity of said
sources to furnish the daily supply; property
owned and not utilized and its valuation, the i
condition of the works and a comprehensive I
estimate of operating expenses, and the valua- i
tion -of all property of the company, including I
reservoirs, pipes and mains, with such other j
in forms as may be developed in the ex-
Bmitisfon, that may be pertinent to the in
quiry*-- to character, condition and value of
the __-jteerty belonging to the Spring Valley
IVaierj^Yorks.
Supervisor Haskins said the City al
ready %ad two experts in its employ, and
he thought that that portion of the reso
lution should be stricken out.
Supervisor Britt said he would like to |
ask if at the last meeting of the board i
action was not taken on tbis identical
proposition?
Dr. Clinton pointed out that the object |
of the present resolution was merely to j
correct an error contained in the first. !
The original resolution conferred power
upon the board, instead of the committee, j
which was absurd. If there were experts !
in the employ of the City, the committee j
certainly would not overlook them.
Britt, continuing, .aid be was opposed i
to the resolution. The board was re- j
"sponsible for the action of any export ap- j
.pointed, and ii it were deemed necessary
to make such an appointment the power j
Should certainly remain with the board. !
since the responsibility rested with the j
latter. The fixing of the rates would de- j
pend upon the recommendations of the '
experts, and be contended that this privi
lege should not be given oyer to any com
mittee. Even as a member of the Water j
Committee he did not desire to force upon
the board any expert unacceptable to it.
Supervisor Delany thought the resolu
tion premature. . The witnesses hitherto !
examined had given the committee more j
information than was really necessary, j
and he held that the investigation should
.be continued. Seeing that the board was
pledged to retrenchment, he was opposed
to the creation of new offices, and there
lore to the resolution.
Dr. Dodge said that if the report of the
experts were to be accepted as final he
would be opposed to any shifting of the
responsibility, but if the committee ap
pointed tbem to obtain information which
the committee could not itself obtain, in
order to arrive at an intelligent con
clusion, he could not see where the ob
jection arose to their appointment. The
small expense involved, in view of the im
portance of the inquiry, should not cut
any figure. He also thought that the ap
pointment should be left to the judgment
of the committee, nor did he believe that
the board would have any cause to com
plain of its action if this were done. The
trouble about the information hitherto
supplied was that it was not just what the
c.ommitttee desired, and in view of the
difficulty experienced in obtaining the in
formation the committee did desire, be
did not think: that this uncalled-for in
formation should be taken in favor of the
company. . The committee bad asked
specific questions at the beginning of the
investigation, which bad not yet been an
swered.
Supervisor Britt again voiced his objec
tions to any surrender of the board's au
thority to the committee in this connec
tion.
Dr. Clinton said that the board seemed
determined to misunderstand him on this
point. The resolution was desi.ned to cor
rect the earlier one, nor did be want to go
outside the employes of the City in en
gaging an expert, "It." continued he,
"you are going to emasculate the commit
tee at this stage of the proceedings I de
sire to resign. Ido not ask you to employ
an engineer now. It may not be neces
sary. But if it is, we should be able to do
"t at once. Ido not think lam egotistical
when I say that I believe the board should
have sufficient confidence in us to repose
this power in the committee."
Supervisor Haskins argued that the
power of the board should not be segre
gated in a committee of five.
Supervisor Shechan arose to ask who
had employed the stenographer in this in
vestigation.
Dr. Clinton replied that it was custom
ary for the chairman of the committee to
encage the stenographer, but that on this
occasion the board, with its usual desire
ior patronage, made the appointment.
The resolution was then put to the vote
and defeated on a division of 7 to 4, De
vaaey, Haskins, Delaney, Sheeban, Mor
ton, Britt and Rivers being in the neg
ative.'Â£aÃStÂ§_Â§B|
Dr. Clinton then moved that the Com
mittee on Water and Water Supply be
empowered, if necessary, to employ an
engineer, or corps of engineers, and an ex
pert accountant to assist the committee in
this examination, and that their selection
be subject to the approval of the board.
The motion carried by 10 to 1, Delaney
alone voting in the negative.
The cleric read the recent opinion fen
dered by the City and County Attorney in
response to the board's inquiry as to the
logality of fixing the rates later than Feb
ruary. The writer stated in effect tbat
though the board might be prosecuted for
malfeasance in office should the fixing of
the rates be delayed the possibility of such
procedure being resorted to could not af
fect the legality of the action or its neces
sity and that the investigation could be
continued up to the last day of June.
Dr. Clinton said he was pleased to bear
this, because as chairman of the commit
tee he would not be ready to offer a report
this month. The more he saw of this
question the more momentous it seemed
to* him. He had not yet had a chance to
visit either the company's office or the
various sources of supply, which was a
duty he hoped tbe board would assist him
to undertake at an early date. He need
not repeat that it was the desire of the
committee to deal fairly by both tbe com
pany and the people. He moved that the
communication be received and tiled.
Dr. Rottanzi from the chair warned the
board of the risk it was assuming in de
laying the investigation be\*ond February.
The motion subsequently carried and
the board resolved itself into committee
of the whole, with Dr. Clinton in the
chair.
Dr. Rottanzi moved tbat any report or
communication from the company be
forthwith read. He believed he made a
motion at the last meeting requesting the
secretary to supply the committee with a
statement concerning stocks and bonds.
The clerk said that no communication
had been received.
* Attorney Kellogg informed tbe board
that the secretary would be sworn to give
the necessary information.
Rottanzi preferred to postpone the
hearing of the secretary's testimony and
proceed with the examination of Engineer
Schussler. He wanted a written state
ment.
Mr. Schussler again took the stand and
Supervisor Lackman resumed the in
quiry with the following question: "What
proportion of the company's receipts are
obtained from private consumers and
from meter rates and what proportion
from special and general rates?"
The witness said he was willing to give
all the information in his power, but
asked the committee that be might be
permitted to finish his answers without
being constantly interrupted, as such in
terruptions interfered seriously with his
answers. He could not reply to the
above question definitely, but the book
keeper could. He (Schussler) could* only
give the total income of the company from
private consumers and from the City.
ln the absence of the bookkeeper the
question was passed over.
"What," asked Lackman, "was the
number of hydrants placed in the City
during the last eighteen months, or from
July 1,1895?"
The witness thought he could closely
approximate the number set in 1895 and
1896. During the second half of 1895 the
number was greater than during the first
half, owing to the urgent request of the
Fire Department. * The company could
hardly keep pace with the demand from
the department and the board, in addition
to which the former would not consent to
the hydrants being attached to- 6-inch
pipes, so that the company had to lay
fresh pipe. He believed tbat the exact
number set in 1895 could be obtained from
the Fire Department The total, he
thought, in that year wa3 3296, though
some bad afterward been taken up and re
placed. There were possibly 3000 hydrants
now, in round numbers. About 520 or 530
were set in 1895 and from 475 to 490 in the
whole of 1896, or about 1000 for the two
years. '. . ; 7
"The hydrant rate was increased from
$2 50 to $5. was it not?" asked Lackman.
"Yes," replied the witness, "and upon
that we have spent many thousands of
dollars in accordance with the request of
tbe Fire Department, especially south of
Market street." The City, he continued,
has less hydrants, in proportion to tbe
number of miles of pipe, than any large
city in America.
"They did not increase as rapidly when
the rate was $2 50?" suggested Lnckman.
"No," replied Mr. Schussler,. "because
when the rate was increased we could af
ford to increase the number of mains."
The Board of Supervisors in office in 1895,
he said, in order to decrease the water
rates on private consumers and to meet
the urgent demands of the Chief of the
Fire Department, increased the rate from
$2 50. to $5, and thereupon the company
went to work and resystematized their
main system and placed hydrants thereon.
"The last report," said Lackman, "states
that the lowest rate for meters is $2 50.
Are there not many consumers who- do
not use so much water?"
The witness said he knew nothing about
that. But the total revenue from water
sales by meter was 22>_ cents per 1000
gallons; or if one divided all the money
received from water rates by the amount
of water sold through the meters they re
ceived on an average about 22*^ cents, and
that was identically the same price,
within a fraction, as the total revenue for
water salesâ viz. : 22">_ cents.
Supervisor Brittâ You said that several
changes were made in your water system
in the southern portion of the City after
the large fire. Are yon prepared to give
us an idea ofâ to describe and illustrateâ
the changes that were made there and the
size of the mains?
Mr. Schussler here produced two large
maps showing respectively the entire pipe
system of the City and the work done in
1895 and 1896. The pipes marked in red,
he explained io the Supervisors, who
crowded round him to inspect the maps,
were laid in 1895, and those -marked in
blue in 1896. The pipes in the vicinity of
the recent fire were only large enough to
supply the wants of ordinary consumers
and were rapidly exhausted.
"Who was to blame for this stato of af
fairs?" asked the chairman. ,'J'JJ- J
"The City was ;to blame," I replied tHe
THE PAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 897.
witness promptly, "for leaving the neigh
borhood unprotected, because they had so
continuously crippled our resources we
could not afford to lay a larger system."
Blocks of twelve or sixteen inch pipe, he
added, cost a lot of something
like $2700 or $2800 at $3 a foot. Hydrants
at $2 50 or $3 a month did not pay them
for the trouble and expense involved. If
the City would agree to pay them $5 a hy
drant or any fair sura to guarantee them
an income on the extra outlay then they
could come to an understanding as to now
many hydrants they should put in.
A long and informal discussion fol
lowed, in which the witness pointed out
the various improvements made by the
company in the locality outlined by the
maps. On Stevenson street, for example,
be cited the new main which is taking
the place of the old 6-inch pipes at the
request of the Fire Department.
Mr. Schu-sler stated that the rates on
water had been gradually reduced from
47.85 cents per 1000 gallons in 1865 to 22.5
cents in 1896.
"When this City has reached 700,000 in
habitants the rate will be about 15 cents
per 1000 gallons." said the engineer, "when
there are 1,000,000 people about 13 cents
and when the population teaches 1,250,000
the rate will not be greater than 11 cents
per 1000 gallons." 7. 7
In reference to some of the possible
sources of supply, Mr. Schussler stated
that if the Searsville dam was built and
the water turned on it would furnish about
5,000,000 gallons per day. The system, Mr.
; Schussler said, would cost about $1,000,
--000. Already $120,000 have been spent on
the dam. Fifty feet is to be added to the
thickness and forty feet to the height,
thus increasing the capacity tenfold.
In reference to Pescadero and San
Gregorio creeks, Mr. Schussler stated that
the two could be made to furnish 18,000,000
gallons per day. . _* ~f.
In answer to a question from Mayor
Phelan, who bad come in in the mean
time, Mr. Schussler stated that the Cal
averas lands and water rights had cost
about $1,000,000 and the possible supply
is about 28,000,000 to 30,000,000 gallons per
day. . : , * .'.:'
The cost of the property on Stockton
and Geary streets on which the company
is now erecting its new offices was stated
by Mr. Schussler to be $475,000, $120,000 for
the lot and about $355,000 for the ouilding.
Mayor Phelan wanted to know whether
the Spring Valley Company had not dis
couraged the establishing of small private
water plants.
Mr. Schussler said that he knew noth
ing about the matter, that he had beard
more about such matters in the City Hall
than in his own office.
Mayor Phelan asked how much money
had been spent by the company in im
proving the plant since 1890.
Mr. Schussler gave the figures for the
new construction account, which includes
land purchased lor reservoir sites aud
other purposes. The figures were then
given as follows:

Then the Mayor asked that the reports
of Engineer, yon Schmidt and Dunn on
the value of the works in 1890 be incor
porated in the report of the proceedings.
Yon Schmidt estimated the value of the
plant at $13,642,000 and Dunn at $13,313,
--504, making the total value according to
' the experts and the figures previously
given about $16,811,400.
Engineer Schussler objected to these
figures on the ground that the proper
value of the properties waÂ» not known to
the engineers, and also on the ground that
large properties were left out of the es
timate.
"Well, we are the judges," said the
Mayor, "we consider tbe value of your
plant for the purpose of fixing rates."
"If you would transpose that word 'fix
ing' into 'reducing' you would do better,"
retorted Schussler.
"Oh, we are the judges," said the Mayor.
"If you are poor judges then we will go
to law about it," answered the engineer.
"You have got to give us fair rates on our
investments and running expenses. We
will have fair rates or we will have some
one greater than the Board of Supervisors
step in."
Mayor Phelan accused the company of
inflating the value of the bonds ot .the
company from $7,000,000 to $11,000,000, but
was checked by Attorney Kellogg, who
insisted that no such thing had been done.
The committee then adjourned until
7:30 o'clock on Thursday evening.
THE BIG ROAD RACE.
Associated Club*' Twenty - five - Mile
Event 'Will Be Held Sunday.
Tue. road-racing committee of the As
sociated Cycling Clubs has decided to hold
the annual tweniy-five-mile event, which
was postponed from Washington's birth
day, owing to the bad condition of the
roads around San Leandro, on next Sun
day, the 27th. .
: A two weeks' postponement was first
contemplated, but the roads have. dried
so rapidly that they will he in excellent
condition by next Sunday, and it was
thought best to hold the race then and
have it over with. There are over 100
men entered, and it would bava been hard
to have held them all in training lor an
additional two weeks.
The Imperial Cycling Club's ten-mile
event, which was scheduled for next Sun
day, will therefore, be put over until
March 7, and the members have been so
notified.
There will be a big entry list of crack
riders for the Santa Rosa meet next Satur
day. In the professional events particu
larly will be seen the speediest field of
starters ever gathered together at a Cali
fornia meet, and the amateur events will
include all th<* crackerjacks in that class.
A special round-trip rate from this City of
$1 50 has been secured, and the visitors

Hands.

lesque, the Rssu Gorge Lask
Is Stage Director.
â W\
The Concordia Club will on Saturday
evening next present an original bur
lesque on "The Prisoner of Zenda" en
titled, "Zenda's King, or a Misfit Mon
arch.'' The "book" was written by John
P. Wilson, who was so long identified
with the Tivoli, and the music by William
Lorraine, a young composer, who first
made himself popular by his well-known
"Mollie Newell." The libretto is very
funny and the music excellent, and it is a
safe wager that this entertainment will
[ outshine anything ever given by a private
organization in this City. Special scenery
Is being painted lor it and handsome cos
tumes specially designed. George .Lask of
the Tivoli is staging the affair. The prima
donnas (Leon Greene baum and Milton
Bremer) are on speaking terms and the
burlesque is progressing swimmingly.
The first scene is laid in tbe woods of
Puritania witb an inn in view. The act is
opened by a soldiers' chorus, "The Royal
Guards of Puritania." Colonel Blotz en
ters and informs them that King Ruled
off is to be crowned on the morrow, but
that Swatz Mike (Black Michael) is plot
ting for the throne. They all swear alle
gience to Ruledoff and exeunt. Black Mike
witb his two minions Bluster and Buster
mace their appearance and he sings, "I
Am the Heavy Villain of the Play," and
does a dance, after which the minions
disappear and Antwinette (a Chicago ad
venturess, who has previously been mar
ried to every man in the play) makes her
entrance. She and the villain plot deep
plots and resolve to buy some "knock-out
drops" and thereby dispose of Ruledoff.
Antwinette bies to the drugstore to. pro
cure the deadly potion, and Black Mike
hies to the nearest grocery-store to buy his.
The King is heard outside to sing a
drunken song, and enters in a glorious
state of intoxication. He calls loudly for
the barmaid. Antwinette comes in, and
after handing him the drug recognizes
in him one of her former husbands,' and
makes a hurried exit. The King, after
drinking amply, becomes delirious and
sees visions.
"Don't you see them?" he moans; "the
angels round the top of The Call build
ing."
Bluster and Buster enter and carry him
off to a place of safety. ;*-*: 7
Fritz and Colonel Blotz next appear.
Tbey have discovered . the disappearance
of the King and are considerably worried,
knowing that Black Mike is next of- kin,
and will reign if the real King cannot be
found. They are in the depths of despair,
when Razzle Dazzle, a tramp, rides in on
a small velocipede. He bears a startling
resemblance to the King. -77 â 
"Hold, an idea The tramp shall im
personate the King." v - â  . . â  â¢.._ .
Without further adieu they proceed to
shave Razzle Dazzle, who loudly protests,
but o.i being told that he is handsomer
than before he becomes satisfied. Exit
all to have a drink on the new King. .
A wild blast of music announces the ar
rival of all concerned to hear the procla
mation Black Mike bas prepared, telling
of the disappearance of Ruledoff and bis
(Black Mike's) succession to Ibe throne in
consequence. He winds up. by asking all
tho>e in favor of his reigning to say
'aye." All shout "aye."
Triumphant entrance of Razzle Dazzle
as the King. He divests Black Mike of
the royal toga, crown and scepter, and in
forms those present that be has. opened a
keg of beer at bis own expense, and in
vite all to have some. > They do so. and
tbe first act closes there.
The second act opens tn the throne room
of the palace. and the chorus singing a
drinking song.* The bogus king enters
with Colonel Boltz and Fritz, who are
trying to teach him courtly manners.
Black Mike enters unobserved by them,
shaking his fist as they wend their way off
center. T. Willie Dare-Devil runs in and
informs Black Mike that the real king is
confined within the walls of Zenda. Mike
sees a ray of hope and dispatches
William *to do away with the king for
good.
The crowning of the bogus King is next
on the programme and the soldiers as
semble for the ; : event. 7 Then follows
grand processional entrance of ; Razzle-
Dazzle leading the Princess Caviar, who is
heavily veiled. Razzle places the crown
npon his head and says a la Chimmie
Fadden, "Me and Napoleon always does
our own crowning," after which eloquent
burst of language* the soldiers back out.
leaving the king and the princess alone.
He proceeds to court her, as per Colonel
Blotz's instructions, and j upon removing
her veil "to gaze into the windows of her
soul" starts back in. horror, for the prin
cess is a fright. He says he thinks he
will take a stroll, but on being confronted
by pistols by Blotz and Fritz changes his
mind, comes back and sings a topical
song. After divers tendernesses she de
parts. Blots enters and tells him of the
real king's discovery. "We will lose our
heads and maybe our jobs."
The roar of a cannon is heard without
and several baits roll across the stage.
Black Mike r.nd Razzle engage in mortal
combat. Mike is about to slay Razzle,
when the princes- rushes in between
them, exclaiming "King or no king, I Jove
him!" Mike is about to ascend the
throne when the soldiers rush in and say,
"King Ruledoff is at the gates of the
palace." Black Mike is condemned . to
have his bead put under the pump. He
faints at the trough of water and is car
ried out by Bluster and Buster.
Thus the burlesque ends happily for all
concerned, the clever skit winding up
with a medley of popular songs put to
nursery rhymes. -
It will, indeed, be a grand affair, costing
$3000, and he or she may count himself as
fortunate who gets an invitation.
WANT A NEW AVENUE
.Sunset Club Wants Nineteenth Avenue
Opened From the Park to
Ingleside.
The residents of that section of the City
lying south of Golden Gate Park and west
of First avenue, who designate their ter
ritory as "Sunset Valley," claim to be in
sore need of improvements. The first and
most important of the many evils com
plained of is the entire lack of sewerage in
that section. To remedy this a petition
was drawn up at a meeting of the Sunset
Improvement Club at H street and Ninth
avenue last night, which was signed by
all the members present. This will be
presented to the Supervisors at their next
meeting on Monday afternoon, request
ing that a sewer be constructed from First
to Twentieth avenue over the following
line: Along J street to Tenth avenue;
thence along H street to Eighteenth ave
nue, terminating at Twentieth avenue and
I street. This, if done, will, it is claimed,
carry off the refuse from the Almshouse,
which is permitted to lodge in a foul pond
in the sandhill south of the inhabited
portion of the valley. *
The next request that will come from
this club will be to have Nineteenth ave
nue opened from tbe park to Ingleside.
The Spring Valley Water Company has
promised to deed a strip of its land to the

A STRIKE THREATENED.
Employes in the State Printing
0 fiee Have Not Been
Paid.
District Organizer H. H. Watts Wl.l
Go to the Scene of the Trouble '
at Once.
A telegraphic dispatch received by The
Call from its special Sacramento corre
spondent stated that the printers in the
Slate Printing Office will go out on a
strike to-day. A strike would clog the
work of the Legislature and cause great
trouble for the State's law-makers. Such
a . thing as a body of union workmen
blocking the work of a Legislature by a
strike has no precedent in the history of
the United States. j .
District Organizer H. H. Watts of this
City, whose district takes in California,
Arizona and Nevada, will leave for the
scene the trouble to-day. The cause of
the trouble, Mr. Watts states, is that
the printers have not been paid for their
services for the past six weeks, and unless
they fore* the Legislature into providing
for their money by appropriation, they
may be left out altogether.
From what can be learned the difficulty
is caused by a difference of opinion be
tween Governor Budd and State Printer
Johnston. The letter asked for an appro
priation of $75,0"/0 to properly conduct the
office, hut after tue bill reached the Gov
ernor's Lands he blue-penciled or vetoed
tfte measure. Two other bilis appropriat
ing money for the State Printing Office
have been placed on tbe shelf, and mean
while 350 attaches of the office have been
wondering when and how they will be
paid. As it is expected that the Legisla
ture will come to an a â  journment on or
about March 13 the printers decided to
force the issue. . --â -
. Mr. Watts, in discussing the situation,
stated that he does not believe that the
men will go out on a strike to-day, for it
would be a violation of the. International
Typographical Union's rules. Before a
strike could be legal, under union rules,
the men would have to obtain the consent
of the International Union's officers, who
are in Indianapolis.
It is possible, but not likely, that the
men may walk out on their own responsi
bility, out in such a case they could not
look to tbe union for support.

ILLNESS CAUSES
A SHORT DELAY
The Craven-Fair Struggle
Goes Over Until
Monday.
Delmas Was Anxious for Trial
at One?, but Pierson
Was Sick.
Cooney 's Attorneys Decide Not to
Introduce Any Evidence in I
' His Defense.
The fight between Mrs. Nettie R. Craven
and tne Fair heirs opened yesterday morn
ing in court, but only for a time long
enough to inform Judge Slack that Attor
ney M. M. Pierson was sick and that an
adjournment until Monday was in order.
It was Pier-on's partner, R. B. Mitchell,
who brought this news to court. Mitchell
said Pierson was seriously ill and pro
duced a doctor's certificate to corroborate
his wofds. He thought an adjournment
for two weeKs would be the proper thing.
Attorney D. M. Delmas was for. an im
mediate trial. As the representative of
Mrs. Craven he was tired of delays and
postponement. "We were told a week
ago," said Dalmas, "that there would be
no further delays. -Mr. Pierson anyhow,
as I understand it, is not the leading
counsel on the other side." r i>v:" ,7
Mitchell, in reply, said Pierson had
spent the past fifteen months in studying
up the law in the case. His illness was
unavoidable. Garret McEnerney chipped
in to say that as th- re was a* trial eoing on
at present it would hardly be worth while
10 begin the case this week. Judge Slack
finally agreed to let the affair go over
until Monday next.
In Judze Cook's court the Cooney case
was called to allow his 'attorneys to an
nounce what plans they had matured for
his defense. Attorney Keddy thought
there was no evidence against the notary
worthy of the name, and informed the
court that no evidence would be intro
duced in his client's behalf. Attorney
Reddy then proceeded to recite legal au
thorities in support of his contention that
Cooney should be discharged, after which
the court announced that a decision would
be rendered this morning.
In the afternoon Judge Cook laid the
matter before* the Grand Jury. He said
the case was takine up a great deal of his
time and suggested that the jurors read
the testimony for themselves.

of counterfeiting and having spurious
coins in his possession, was convicted in,
the United States District Court yester
day.
Xarns put up a very weak defense, being
the only witness called by his attorney,
A. P. Van Dozer. He testified that he
had caught a woman living in the house
where he boarded making counterfeit
nickels and had warned her against the
practice and had taken her tools and ma
terials from her to prevent her from get
ting into trouble. This he said accounted
for tbe spurious 5-cent pieces found on
him. He could not explain why he had
not destroyed the stuff or turned it over
to the officers.
Tne testimony â  produced by Secret
Service Agent Harris and elaborated by
the questioning of Assistant United
States District Attorney Bert Scniess
inger was strong, and tbe jury brought
in a verdict of guilty after a short delib
eration.
