Fast Time Made by the

ENGINES SHOW EEMAEKABLE
UNIFORMITY.
Not the Least Defect Apparent When
the End of the Course
Is Reached.
BOSTON, Mass., April 7.â Under favor
able conditions and to the satisfaction of
all concerned, the United Stales battle
ship lowa was given her official trial to- ;
day over the Cape Ann course, ana under j
the inspection of the naval board ap- j
pointed lor the purpose. On the trial she ;
made an average speed of 17 knots over'
the btj-miie course, exceeding her contract
speed by one knot and winning a bonuÂ»
Of $25,000 ior her builder?.
The figuring of 17 knots is a close one
and there is not much of a margin to .
allow for error?, but since the tHal correc
tions are likely to be in the ship's favor it â 
is reasonably certain that tue official
ficures will show 17 knots.
The lowa tinishcd her run after nearly i
five hours' continuous steaming in just as
cood condition aa when she started, and :
without the least defect being apparent ,
anywhere and without the slightest heat
ing of her bearings. The conditions were
favorable for making steam and the
boilers showed an average pressure of 152 i
pounds, or all that coutu be expected of
ihem. Both engines ran witn remarkable !
uniformity, the revolutions of the screws '
not falling telow 111 per minute nor rising !
above lI.V-i. and averaging 112 for the run. â 
The speed was also remarkably uniform
between the several marks along the
course, and shows that the vessel made
scarcely any spurts, but kept close to her
best work all the time, the variations
being almost wholly due to the changing
depths of the water.
Immediately after the completion of the
course the lowa was sent along rapidly xo
port and then to starboard for a half circle
under way, to determine the maneuvering
ability. She answered her helm readily
and showed the possibility of turning a
circle of Jess than 400 yards. She was also
very steady in her trimming, and her
greatest angle of heel was only two de
grees. The absence of vibration, even
when the ship was driven at her highest
speed, was very marked. In Tact tne vi
bration could hardly be felt, except at the
extreme bow and stern.
The trial showed, in short, that little is :
left to be desired either in design or con
struction, and the official board expressed
it unofficially so. But the official report
Will be the same.
The stations were 6.6 miles apart, and
the course was thirty-three miles north
east from t:.e first station, about five
miles northeast of Thatchers Island, to
the sixth station, about a miie to the
eastward of Boone Jsiand buoy, and re
turn. Tne elapsed time for the first half
was 1:57:23; average speed. 1(5.873 knots.
For tne second half, 1:55:24; average
fcpeed, 17.47. Average speed for the entire
distance, 17 knots. Elapsed time. 3:52:47.
The ship left her moorine* in Boston
harbor for the racecourse at P:3oa. v., '
and returned to her anchorace oft the !
lower light shortly after 4 o'clock p. m

DR. RUTLAND'S CASE.
Startling Array of Test-men/ Against the
Man fl/ho Ground Out Bogus
Medical D p/cmas.
CHICAGO, 111., Anril 7. â Evidence in
tho case of Frederick Rutland, S.D., Ph.D.,
M.D., president and director of the Eclec
tic Medical College, wa? submitted to the
Federal Grand Jury to-day. The case is
one of National interest from the fact
that Rutland is charged with using the
mails as a mean? to delraud youn^ men
ambitious to become physicians, tbe noni
inal fee of .$35 bein^ charged lor matricu
lation, examination and graduation. The
alleged college was located in the resi
dence district of tne West Side, but ttie
"examinations" were conducted through
the mails.
The books of the concern failed to show
the total bogus diplomas issued, but they
are said to run into the thousands ana
are found to be in every State in the
Union.
Rutland was admitted to bail after his
arrest by the Federal officers, but skipped
bis bonds about three weeks ago. His
household effects and those of the college
were shipped to Canada, but the fugitive
has not so far Deen located.
The evidence is so overwhelming tbat a
true bill of many counts is certain. Rut
land's bogus diploma scheme is said to
have been the most pretentious and ex
tensively operated in this country since
the infamous "Dr." Buchanan of Phila
delphia was sent to the penitentiary in
the '80s .
On the trial of Buchanan's case it was
shown that he had sent no less than 10,000
diplomas to foreign countries. His con
viction put a stop to the business in this
country for several years.
A MEXICO SENSATION.
The Widow Ordonez Accuses Ex- Governor
R vercll of the Murder of Her
Husband.
PACHECO, Mexico. April 7. âA big
political seusation has been caused here
by the action of Mrs. Eniildo Ordonez.
Her husband was a newspaper editor
and writer of this city, who was alleged to
have been killed while serving a brief
term in prison here for offenses against
the State government.
She has filed a petition with the Mexi
can Coneress, praying that ex-Governor
Ramon F. Riveroll, now a member of
Congress from this State, be surrendered
to the court? for trial for the death of her
husband.
She alleges that ex-Governor Riveroll .
hnd her husband killed for political rea
sons.
Just what action Congress will take in
the matter, of course, cannot be definitely
stated. It can be sa;d, however, that tneic
will be an investigation of some sort.
Riveroll is a prominent man and hi?
friends scout the idea that he had any
thing to do with the murder of Ordonez.
On the other hand the wi low is positive
in her statements, and it ia said that all
the political enemies of Riveroll are back
ing her up.
The mystery surrounding the death of
Ordonez has been a deep one, and as he
was known to be an energetic and fearless
writer it is said that not a few prominent
politicians would be interested in his
death.
REPUBLICAN VICTORY.
Elisha Dysr Elected Governor of Rhode
Island by Largest Plurality Ever
Knowi in â fi9 State.
PROVIDENCE. R. 1., April 7.â ln the
Rhode Island election to-day the Repub
licans easily elected their State ticket and
retained their la'ge majority in the Gen
eral Assembly, but were unsuccessful in
selecting their Legislative ticket in the
City. General Elisha Dyer was elected
Governor by a plurality of not less than
12,000, the largest ever obtained* by a
gubernatorial candidate.
In this city a good-government legisla
tive ticket, indorsed by the Democrats,
was nominated against the Republican
machine ticJtet, and it was elected by
good pluralities, although the Republican
State ticket carried the city easily. The
vote was light throughout the State, the
Democrats suffering the greater loss.

MEMPHIS, Tenx., April 7.-AII of the
country east to the main iine of the Ya
zoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad is
flooded, and in many places the water has
gone over the tracks.
The upper crevasse in Tunica County is j
2000 feet wide, and so great is the outpour
that water from below the break is being
drawn up to and hurled out over the fer
tile valley through the crevasse.
The supreme question is the duration of
the flood. At the lower levees along
Louisiana and Southeastern Arkansas j

j the emptying of the delta and Si. Francis
I basin will be slow.
If they break and the river continues to
fall at Cairo the upper St. Francis basin

j will be no difficulty in growing cotton.

FINDS A QUARRY
OF COPPER ORE
Bonanza Struck in the
Foothills Southeast
of Tacoma.
Prospector Uncovers Two Veins
on a Claim That Was
Once Abandoned.
Streaks of Gold Glisten in the Ledges
of the Less Valuable
Mineral.
TACOMA, Wash., April 7.â A copper
mine which promises to rival the bo
nanzas of Montana, Arizona and Mexico
has been discovered on ttie Mashel River,
thirty miles southeast of Tacoma. For
several years past prospectors have occa
sionally brought in samples of float cop
per from that section, but they gave up
before locating the mother vein.
Early last year Henry Jordan located in
the foothills near Mn-bel River a claim
which another prospector had taken up
the year previous and abandoned. To-day
Jordan stands in the shadow of immense
riches. Believing that he bad a good
thing he locaterl a dozen other claims, all
bearing copper. One group of these aFe
bonded by wholesale merchants here for
540.000. To-day the lucky prospector's
agent received an offer from Denver of
$150,000 for ten other claims the Colorado
men desiring to develop them at once.
Probably they will be sold.
Specimens of copper ore which mining
men consider truly wonderful have been
brought in from the Mashel claims. They
are in sheets of from less than one inch to
nearly two feet surface ar.d almost as thin
as a sheet of newspaper. These are al
most pure copper and are tacen from the
seams between the layers of rocks, which
s itself full of shot gold and copper.
There are two veins, which together ag
gregate seventy feet in thickness, nnd
they have been traced a distance of two
miles. In fact, it i* an immense quarry of
copper and gold. There is but oue mine
like it on the globe, and that is in Old
Mexico, and has been operated success
fully for 300 years.
HE MAY BE COURT-MARTIALED.
Charges of a Scandalous Nature Against
Dennis W. Mullan, Commandant of
the Pensaco/a Navy-Yard.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 7.-Tao Sun's
Washington special says: Commander
Dennis W. Muilan, commandant of the
Pensacola Navy-yard, hss oeen under in
vestigation by a court of inquiry upon
charges of a scandalous nature, which, if
proven, will lead to his dismissal from the
service. Captain Reamy and Lieutenant
Lauchheimer have just returned from
Pensacola, where they spent several days
investigating the case and taking: testi
mony. Upon their reoort it will depend
whether Commander Mullan is to be court
marlialed.
If be is tried it is believed that he can
hardly escape severe punishment. If the
court believes trie charges can be substan
tiated ha may be asked to resign, so as to
avoid a scandal in open court. Secretary
Long will take the report up for consider
ation this week. Commander Mullan some
years ago received the thanks of the Mary
land Legislature for meritorious services
on a cruise in the Pacific.
Commander Dennis W. Mullan, a nfi
tive of Maryland, graduated from Annapo
iis in 1603, and was at once sent into active
service as ensign on the Monongauela, in
the West Guli blockade squadron. He
participat d in the various engagements
in woieh the navy took parr, such as the
battle of Mobile Bay and the attack on
Fort Morgan.
After the war the more notable inci
dents in hia career were his participation
in 1871 in two attacks on Korean bat
teries, his visit as American representa
tive to arbitrate the war between Chile
and Peru, and hn experience at Samoa.
In October, ISS7, then a commander, ha
was appointed to command the Nipsic and
ordered to Samoa, where matters were be
coming threatening. There he took such
a bold stand in defence of American in
terests as to compel the respect of the
Uermans, who were trying to carry things
with a high hand. He was in command
of the Nipaic at the time of the great Sa
moan hurricane of ISBO, when of the three
American warships in the harbor the Nip
sic was the oniy one that escaped wreck.
For his conduct at Samoa the City Coun
cii of Annapolis, Md., where Commander
Mullan was born, tendered him a vote of
tnanKs, and the Maryland Legislature
presented him with a cold watch.
Commander Mullan lias several times
been stationed on the Pacific Coast.
DAVITT CALLS ON HARRISON.
The Irish Home- Rule Leader a Warm
Personal Friend of the New Mayor
of Chicago.
CHICAGO, lix., April 7.â Michael Da
vitl, member of Parliament from South
Mayo, Ireland, reached Chicago last night,
en route to Caliiornia, with his family, and
is registered at the Auditorium.
He paid his respects to-day to Mayor
elect Harrison, who was his traveling
companion twenty mnnths ago in an ex
tended journey from New Zealand to San
Francisco. The two in company photo
graphed the Samoan natives and ex
changed ideas on Irish and Cnicago poli
ics under the Southern Cro^s.
"1 feel a strong attachment," said Mr.
Davitt last night, "to the Mayor whom
you have just eiecteJ, as 1 did toward his
father, wuom I also knew well. I am
aware, however, of the feelings and preju
dices of the American people, and that it
is never wibft to interfere in their politics,
as they are fully able to manage their own
affairs."
"How do you enjoy the noise of an
American election night?' be was asked.
"You do not beat us in noise or excite
ment, but 1 think you are abead of us in
the method and expedition with which
you collect your votes," was the answer.
"The speed with which you determine
the decision of the people and discover
their will is something startling to me,
and we have nothing like it in the oid
country."
"How is the Cretan question affecting:
the standing of the parties in Great
Britain?'
â¢The Salisbury Ministry nas rendered
itself extremely unpopular because of its
dastardly policy, and I am not sorry that
its position is daraased. It might nave
brought about a settlement creditable to
the powers and itself had it cnosen, but
us blunderines would turn U out of office
were it left to a vote."
"What is tiie present statUÃ of the
home rule cause?"
"Prospects were nevrr brighter. A
union of forces is making the struggle
potent, and with our ranks closing up we
are prepared to make a grand home run.
The latent political sense of the Irish peo
ple is asserting itself, and the faction dis
turbers are being sent to the rear with the
returning consciousness that there is really
nothing to wrangle about.
"What do the Irish people think about
Cuba? The Nationalist and Liberal or
gans are whh the patriots, but the Salis
bury organs are with the Spanish."
The present is the tenth visit of Mr.
Davitt to America, and he declares that
on account of his domestic relationship he
knows it as well as Ireland. He will leave
his family in California, where they wil]
spend a year, and will then hasten back
to London.
STEEL MILLS SHUT DOWN.
Fcur Thousand Employes About 1o Go Out
on Strike, Suspended by the Illinois
Steel Company.
CHICAGO, 111., April 7.â The Illinois
Steel Company's works at South Chicago
were closed down to-day, shuttinsr out
about 4000 employes. This action was
taken by the management of the concern
when it was learned that a strike had been
ordered to-day among the workmen.
They have been operating the steel mills
for several months under the sliding scale
of wages and the employes have been dis
satisfied. Several efforts were made by
the workmen to have the old wage system
restored. They were unsuccessful to
effect an agreement, and to-da y a strike
was ordered among the greater number of
the men employed there. When the
management learned of this all work in
the mills was suspended and every em
pioye has been shut out.

CAXEA, Greece, April 7.â Fighting of
a somewhat serious nature occurred to
day between the Christians and Turks
outside of Candia. The insurgents, who
were numerically stronger than the Turks,
attacked the outpost 3of the latter from
four points at once. Tne Turks made a
strong tight and succeeded in holding
their position. Their loss was only two
killed, while the loss of the insurgents
was eleven killed.
The insurgents at Kissamo have sent a
letter to the foreign admirals, warning
them of their intention to attack the fort
at that place. The Turkish garrison dis
plays no inclination to have any further
lighting with tne Christians and has asked
to be relieved. It is likely that in view of
the circumstances a strong force will be
placed in the fort, and it is not beyond
probability that international troops will
be dispatched to garrison the place.
With the exception of the fight outside
of Candia, in which the Christians were
repulsed with a heavier loss than they in
flicted on the Moslems, there has been
little or no prospect of the impasse being
overcome by the powers, and even the
Turfcs are becoming disgusted with the
>ituation. Jtteports from the interior show
that the scarcity of provisions is becom
ing greater daily, ana that tnere is much
suffering among the Christians, who are
now practically the only residents outside
the coast towns. The blockade Is main
tained with severity, but despite this fact
(ireek sailors manage occasionally to run
in a cargo of ammunition and food supÂ»
plies. Of course no sufficient supply from
this source can be received, and unless the
powers speedily come to some arrange
ment and the blockade be raised the suf
fering will become acute.

TACOMA, Waph.. April 7.â The Ladies'
Musical Club of this city is an organiza
tion intended for the development of in
strumental and vocal music among its
members, and embraces in its fold all of
Tacoma's four hundred. Last fall Mrs.
Henry J. Ashbuiy, a colored woman, the
wife of the barber of the Tacoma Hotel,
& talented pianist, applied for ad ni is- ion
as a member of the club. She received
no acknowledgment of her application
until this week, when she was informed
that it had "been denied.
It now transpires that the sole and only
reason for her rejection was her color.
The oiKcers of the club admit that there
is nothing against Mrs. Ashbury's char
acter,-but that because of her color her
admission would have resulted in ihe dis
solution of the cJub.
Rev. Alfred W. Martin, pastor of the
First Free Church, having leurned through
bis wife, wno is a member of the club, of
the biackbaliine of Mrs. Ashbury, became
indignant and endeavored to have the
matter reconsidered by the club. The
women would not entertain such a propo
sition, and as a last resort, in order that
the public might be acquainted with the
injustice done Mrs. Ashbury, he pub
hsued a protesting letter in the daily
press to-uay. Thi3 has had the effect ot
putting the members of the club into a
highly excited frame of mind. Rev. Mr.
Martin takes the position that as the club
was organized for educational and not
social purposes it had uo right to exclude
Mrs. Ashbury.
Mrs. Ash bury would easily pass a short
distance away as a white woman. She is
well educated, refined and ladylike in ap
pearance and behavior.
CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS.
The House Votes $200,000 for ihe Rehet
of Fiood Sufferers â Sock/ess Simpson
Causes a Commotion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 7. -The
House was in session an hour to-day, in
which time it passed a joint resolution ap
propriating $200,000 for the relief of the
Hood sufferers in the Mississippi Valley
and enjoyed a little sensation sprung by
Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas. The resolu
tion was introduced by Catching* (D.) of
Mississippi and agreed to unanimously.
Cannon and Walker criticized the appro
priation, however, the latter hoping thai
it was the last that would be necessary
through ttie failure ol the States to put
themselves in a position where they could
constitutionally'take care of their own
people. Walker gave notice that he
would in future object to the passage of
any similar resolution, believing it to be
decasing in its effect upon toe recipients.
Simpson furnished the sensation of the
d^y by following t:ie example of Karle of
South Carolina in the 6enate yesterday
and protesting against the failure to ap
point committees to proceed to the con
sideration of legislative business in the
regular and orderly way. He spoke of the
power exercised by the Speaker aÂ« auto
cratic and described present conditions as
revolution and anarchy.
Speaker Reed responded at some length,
stating that it was the rirst time this con
dition of affairs had existed, Mr. Blame,
in the Forty-second Congress, having
failed to appoint committees promptly at
the beginning of Congress. He had sup
posed until to-day that there was unani
mous concurrence of the opposition that
ihe public did not require the completo

End of a Suit Involving Expenses
Connected With The N.edles
and Mojave Line.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 7.â Judge
Ross of the United States District Court
banded down an important opinion to
day, bearing on the payment of taxes of
tec line of railroad between The Needles
and Mojave. It is in the suit of the Mer
cantile Trust Company against the Atlan
tic end .Pacific et al.
In August, 1834. an agreement was en
tered into between the Southern Pacific
Railroad, the Atlantic and Pacific Rail-
I road, the St. Louis and San Francisco
Railroad and tue Atchison. Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad, in which the party of
the second part was to purchase The
Needles division from the Southern Pa
cific, but owing to the inability of the
party of the first part to give title undor a
mortgage executed in 1875 the line was to
be leased by the Atlantic and Pacific Rail
road pending a cl-ar title. The valuation
wad placed at $7,271,100, of which one-sixth
was to be paid to the party of the first
part and the balance secured by nrst-mort
ga c bonds.
The A and P. met the obligation until
1888, when the State Board of Equali
zation reassessed the line in California.
The receivers who had been appointed in
the meanwhile refused to pay the bill pre
sented by the Soutnern Pacific as their
road's snare of taxe--, attorn evu' fees and
various lines for the year of 1887, amount
inc; to 118.633. The Southern Pacific had
paid the tuxes.
The Mercantile Trust Company, as the
holder of the second mortgage of the en
tire Atlantic and Pacinc road, sought to
have the matter adjusted, as the pay
men; had not been met, owing to a mis
understanding regarding fees and various
expenses. Numerous answers and cross
bills were iiled, but the case has been
ended by the decision to-day, which or
ders the receivers of the road to pay the
bill presented by the Southern Pacific.
THE ST. NICHOLAS AFIRE
A Blaze That Blew Up the
Drugstore on the
Corner.
Losses Are E;t. mated to Be About
Twenty-five Thousand
Dollars
The St. Nicholas Hotel caught tire early
this morning, and before many minutes
had passed the whole eastern end of the
lower floor was in a blaze.
The tire started in George Carroll' 3
drugstore at the gore of Hayes. Larkin
and Market streets, and the rim evidence
of its presence was a terrific explosion that
blew out all three windows of the drug
store.
Fiames followed fast on tne flying glasi,
and the tire started at once to eat up into
the floor above.
The wildest excitement at once prevailed
among the inmates of the hotel, and
every one at once made preparations to
leave.
Prompt efforts of the police kept the fire
under fair control until the engines ar
rived, and then what iookea like a most
dangerous blaze was soon out out.
The stock of the drugstore was entirely
destroyed, and It is not believed that
there was any insurcnce on it. It was
estimated to be worth $2r>,000.
The building has always been looked
upon as a bad placs for a fire, and the
readiness with which the inmates started
for the door was a sign they apnreciated
the gravity of the situation.
Beyond the loss of the drug stock and
the store fixtures, the hotel was daniagel
only to the extent, of a large hole in the
lower floor and the spoiling of the furni
ture in two rooms.
ANNE ANGELL'S FAMOUS SUIT.
Ex-Chief Just.cc Champtta of Michigan
Says the Woman Was Not Jay
Gould's Wife.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 7.â New
interest in the suit brought by Anne An
gell against the estate of Jay Gould has
been awakened by the deposition of ex-
Chief Jusiice John W. Champlin of Mich
igan. Anne Angell claimed to have been
married to Mr. Gould in the early '50's
while he was surveying on the Canadian
frontier, near the town of Champhn. Tha
evidence of Justice Champlin consists of
letters mailed by Jay Gould to him, show
ing that he was not near the place speci
fied at the time.
Mrs. A. M. Hough, a sister of Jay Gould,
now living in Oraneo street, ihiscity, was
&een by a Call correspondent to-dny. She
stated that the suit was brought simply as
a blackmailing schrme, the parties to it
havinc; never hoped to do more than re
ceive a good round sum to hush the
matter and prevent so much undesirable
notoriety.
Oruhialiy the suit was brought acainst
the estate by Anne Angell. Later it was
assigned to her attorneys for the nominal
sum of $1. It was then transferred from
the estate to Helen and Ed Gould. They
have their evidence in the case well in
band and have nothing to fear.

MARRIED HALF A CENTURY
Friends Congratulate Mr. and
Mrs. E. V. Robbins on Their
Golden Wedding.
Owing to the Commemoration the
M.ntone Was the Scene of a
Pleasant Reception-
Mr, and Mrs. E. V. Robbins received
the congratulations of hosts of friends at
the Mentone, corner of Powell and Sacra
mento streets, last evening, the occasion
being the fiftieth anniversary of tueir
marriage.
The reception-rooms of the Mentone
were handsomely decorated with ferns
and choice flowers, but, true to California,
the predominating color was that of the
poppy, which nestled everywhere, adding
grace and beauty to the scene.
Mrs. Robbins was assisted in receiving
her guests by Mrs. J. G. Chown, Mrs.
Adams and Mrs. Loomis.
Mrs. Mary Field of San Jose was poet
laureate of the occasion. She penned a
few vertes, which the host and hostess,
who have been together for a half century,
.-ay they will treasure forever. During the
evening the little poem was read. In part
it is as follows:
A BIRD SONO.
What a joyous pair of Robbins
Built their happy ne,t together
toe tickle April weather.
la the sumhine ana the suow,
J-ongaco!
But did ever pair of Robbins
Keep their happy nest together
fifty years of changeful weatherâ
Tell us ye who know bird loreâ
Thuja before?
Mr. and Mrs. Koobins would have much
enjoyed to have had their children here
10 celebrate with tuein this anniversary,
but as they are in London and Berlin the
reunion was impossible on this occasion.
Their greetings were received here with a
promise that they would be here in spirit
if they could not be in person.
Fifty years ago Mr. Robbins was a young
merchant in his native town in Oswego
County. New York, wnich business he fol
lowed for about twenty years, and for ten \
years afterward was engaged as a general j
commission merchant in Chicago. Dur- !
ing that time he was a prominent mem
ber of the Chicago Board of Trade, in 1868
being chosen its president.
In ISG9 Mr. Robbins was one of a com
mercial party composed of representative
men of Chicago, chosen from various
branches of business, including members
of Congress and the Governor of the State,
who made the first transcontinental trip
to California. While here some business
prospects were presented which lured him
to make his home in California in 1870.
Notwithstanding all the attractions
which California offers he has always felt
that from a business standpoint the great
mistake of his life was in leaving Chicago.
AKRESTED ST. PETER.
Ho !â  in Jail Under an Eastern Charge
of Kmbezzlement.
OAKLAND* Cal.. April 7.â John St.
Peter from Pittsburg was arrested here
this morning and to-night a telegram was
received by Chief Lloyd detailing the par
ticulars of an embezzlement. St. Peter
was secretary of the Window-glass Work
ers' Association of Jeannetie, about thirty
miles from Pittsburg.
About eight weeks ago he left with all
the funds at his mercy. He came West
and search was made, but nothing could
be learned till recently, when it was stated
that he was in Oakland. Chief Lloyd and
his detectives set to work and found St.
Peter and his wife and child living at 875
Washington street.
He was found last night and this morn
ing he was arrested at the Broadway depot
just as he was about to buy a ticket tor
San Francisco. At first he denied every
thing, but later he admitted the charge
and said that all he got away witn was
$600.
Requisition papers have already been
prepared, and he will be taken back to
Pittsburgh
While in Oikland his family has been
helped by the Associated Charities under
the names of Thomas and Richards, but
this was presumably done to throw people
off the track, and to explode the idea that
he had money. It is also reported from
Pittsburg that he left partly to escape an
other wife, but he denies this to-night.
St. Peter is well connected at Pittsburg
and he expresses the beJiet that he will
have no difficulty in fixing matters with
the association, which is a worliingmea's
affair.

One of the V uths Pursued by a
R.ncner and Woun'ed Before
He Is Captured
FREBNO, Cat.., April 7.â During the
rast week a number of Chinese and
Japanese laborers, walking from their
places of employment to and from this
city in ttie evening, have been "held up"
and robbed. The officers were unable to
obtain clews as to the guilty persons
uniil this afternoon, when they succeeded
in rounding up a gang of five young men,
ranging in ages from 17 to 20 years, who
had started our on careers of brigandage
by robbing inoffensive Mongols.
The prisoners have all been living with
their parents in this city, and it ia the
first time that any of them nave been
arrested. They are Charles and Chester
Bartholomew, Ahab Aziidenan, Nail
Brown and Ed Huiburt.
'Ihe apprehension of the pang was
effected through the capture this after
noon of Cnestor Bartholomew a"d t&e
Hulburt boy, shortly after tuey h*d com- j
mitted a bold daylight robbery of two
Japanese on the highway, about three
miles southeast of th s city. Tney wera
caught by Rancher O. H. Hays after an
exciting chase of soveral miles through
the vineyards. The pursuer rired several
shots over Hulburt'i head and sent a bul
let through his ngUt arm before bringing
him to a stop.
Huiburt and Bartholomew had followed
the two Japanese out into the country
Irom thiÃ city, and it was about 1 o'clock
when they robbed them. One of the vic
f.ms had a pistol and made an unsuccess
ful attempt to defend bimself with it. The
roDDers took it from him and re.ieved him
of a watch and chain.
The hold-up was witnessed by ranchers
living near by, and two men pursued tne
robbersfor about a m ile. They then came
to Hays' place and told him of what had
happened. He armed himself with h:?
pistoland took after toe fugitives. Sheriff
Scott happened to be driving in the vi- I
cn.ty and drove around to head the rob
bers otf, but before he could do so Hays
had captured Hulburt. Bartholomew hid
and doviced his pursuers.
Sheriff Scott brought the wounded pris
oner o town to have his arm attended to,
and Hays took up the hunt for the Bar
tholomew lad, who was captured without
much difficulty.
Th s evening the prisoners made a com
plete confession. They implicated the
other members of the gang and told of all
tne robberies they had committed. The
boy? formed a sorrowful aggregation in
the County Jail to-night, the other three
having been immediately arrested upon
the confession of Bartholomew and Hui
buri. They also admit their guilt.
SEARCHING FOR Alt HEIRESS.
Wealthy Alabama Woman Invokes the
Aid of Portland Dstect/ves to
Locate Her Niece.
PORTLAND, Or., April 7.â Mrs. An
netta Green, an elderiy woman hailing
from Alabama, who came to Portland from
Seattle yesterday, ii searcning for her
niece, Miss Helen Ida Stapleton, whom
she has never seen, but who, if found, will
come into great wealth. Mrs. Green had
a conference with Detective Weich yester
day afternoon with a view of obtaining
his assistance in locating that niece, for
whom she has been seeking all over this
coast for the past two montns.
Mrs. Green says that in 1870 her sister
married L. J. Stapleton, a well-to-do man,
in Covington, Ky., and soon thereafter
they went to San Francisco to live. There
Stapleton engaged in mining sock specu
lation, and when he died in that city in
that city in 1882 there was scarcely enough
remaining of tbe $120,000 be brought to
tbe coast to pay burial expenses.
Mrs. Green and her sister maintained
only a desultory correspondence after the
latier came to this coast, but a year aiter
Stapleton's death his widow wrote that
she and her only surviving ctr.ld, Helen,
proposed taking up their residence either
here or in Seattle. It is now three months
since she received advice of her sister's
death from her n.ece, but as she lest ihe
letter she was unable to say whether it
was dated from San Francisco, Seattle or
this city. The records of these three cities
show no death within ihe past year of a
person answering the description of Mrs
Green's sister, and so far her search for
Miss Helen has been a distressingly fruit
less one.
The old lady ltaied to the detective that
this niece is the only re! a -re she has on
earth. Sbe desires to take the young lady
to Alabama with her, and on her death
to leave to the niece Her estate, worth
about $200,000. â¢

SAN DIEGO, Cal., April 7.â 0. N. Het
ting. a responsible ra.lroad contractor of
many years' experience on this coast, is
in the city. Mr. Hetting has a large
stock of horses and grading machinery on
his hands and no contract on the tapis at
present. To-uay he submitted an offer to
President Morse of the Chamber of Com
merce committee, which is proposing to
construct a railroad from Lakeside to Ka
mona, offering to grade the entire line
twenty-two miles, lay the ties and rails
and put the road into complete shape for
operation upon a proposition of hall cash
and hdlf stock, not a dollar in enher to be
paid until the contract is completed, ex
cept abou 115,000, which he estimates it
would require lor provisions for his men
and moles. He estimates that the work
would require about four months and
would co*t $150,000, aÂ«ide from the rails,
which would cost $;0,G03 more, and he of
fers to put up a bond of $100,000, secured
by the American Surety Company of New
YorK, for the faithful performance of his
contract.
The $15,000 required is already aub-
Bcrioed, and to-niorrow morning a sur
veying party will set out from Lakeside
to" run cross surveys and set the grade
I stakes, the preliminary survey having al
ready been made.
The projectors are very enthusiastic
over the scheme, and believe that at last
San Diego's back country is to be reached
by a road which will penetrate forty miles
into the richest valley in San Diego
County and open up 100,000 acres for de
velopment and settlement.

Track Captain Dole Expected to
Win Laurels for His
Team.
Weight-Toss?r Hazzird in Form for
the Contestâ Training Teb.s
for Athletes.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
7. â On Saturday, April 24, Charles Sum
ner Dole '98 will take his track team to
San Francisco to clay off the tie made by
the athletic teams of Stanford and Berke
ley last year.
By a curious coincidence the captains
of the three Stanford teams this year are
from Southern California â Dole of the
irack team, Fickert of the football eleven
and Thompson of the baseball nine.
Dole is an athlete of unusual ability and a
conscientious worker on the track. His
example bus been worth a great deal to
those who are training under his direc
tion. Ue has laten great interest in Stan
ford affairs since he entered the university
three years ago.
In the last field day on the campus, in
spite of a lame knee, Dole role-vaulted 10
feet 11 inches. This was an increase over
his best recorded performance of 10 feet
10', incbei, which is the present coast
record. He has lately shown a decided
improvement in the broad jump.
Among Dole's records are the coaÂ«t
record for the pole vault, 10 feet 10}^
inches; high jump, ft leet 9}j inches;
broad jump, 20 feet 7,' a inches; 220-yard

Track Team.
hurdle, 27 seconds; 120-yard hurdle, 16 4-5
seconds, and 100-yard dash, 10 3-5 seconds.
He is the champion all-round athlete of
the Y. M. C. A. on ihe coast. He is a
nephew of President Dole of the Hawaiian
Inlands. He weighs 170 pounds in run
ning attire and is tinely built. His major
subject is economics.
George H. Hazzard '!*;, who is taking
post-graduate work this year, will be one
of Stanford's weight-tossers in the inter
collegiate contests. Although weighing
but 103 pounds lie has a record of 126 feet
6 inches in this event. This was made at
the riel i day last year. He tnrows the
hammer with the prettiest motion of any
of the Stanford men, although latsly he
has not equaled his recorded throw for
distance. He turns twice before casting
the weight and requires but a three-foot
ring to make his turns, which shows the
result of constant practice.
This will be Hazzard's fourth appear
ance on an intercollegiate held day, and
according to the intercollegiate athletic
agreement affecting candidates for all ath
letic teams it will be his last.
Hazzard is 24 years old and was born in
San Francisco. altbous;h i'.e now lives in
San Diego. His major study at Stanford
has been English.
Santa Ciara and Stanford will cross bats
on the university diamond to-morrow.
The visiting team will be made up esaeu
tiallv the same as it was when it defeated
the University of California on the same
diamond la-it week. This will give some
indication as to the probable result of the
Stanford- University of California game
which i* to come off in San Francisco, at
Central Park, next Saturday.
The VarÂ»ity team will be composed as
follows: Catcher, Jeffs; pitchers, McLaine
and Beckett; first base, Young; second
base, C. Strohm; shortstop, Lou* head;
third base, Clemen*; right field, W T ight;
center field. Freeman, and left tiald.
ThoniDSon. McLaine will pitch moet of
the g:ime, us Beckett will have to pitch in
the intercollegiate match two days later.
The team has received some valuable
coachiue for a week cast from Jack Shee
han '95. and a decided improvement is
manifest. The evening's practice has been
characterized by more g nger in the field
ing and an improvement in base-running.
The game will be called at 2 p. m.
The following trackmen will eat at the
training table next Monday : Bnnton, Hol
brook, Birtch, Dole, Walker, Burnett,
Morgan. Pope, Adams, Diggies, Wilson,
Smith, Hazzard, Fickert, Lawton, Mur

NAFA LITIGATION ENDED.
William Plass Wins the Suit for a Third
of H,s Dead Brother's
Estate.
NAPA, Cal., April 7.â Judgment in the
case of William Plass vs. Catherine, Philip
and Charles Plass, which has been h?iore
the Superior Court since July of 1596, was
to-day rendered by the court in favor of
the plaintiff for the amount asked for.
In his will, Charles Piass, deceased, gave
a life interest in his estata to Catherine
Plass, his widow, and William Plass, his
brother. On the death of Catherine and
WiHam Piass the estate, which is valued
at $50,000, was lobe given into the pos
session of Philip and Charles Plaas. Wil
liam Plass brought suit a^aiust the estate
for one-third of the lands owned by
Charles Plass. deceased, the lands being
valued at $36,000, claiming that he had
supplied one-tuird oi the purchase price
when the lands were bought.
By the judgment of the court, William
Plass will own in fee simple one-third of
the lands or the equivalent, $12,000.
Under the will he will have a life interest
in the remainder of the estate, or about
$17,000. The case will probably be
appealed.
Tacoma Sliijhled by Congrett.
TACOMA, Wash., April 7. âThe Ta
coma Chamber of Commerce has become
excited over the discovery that the bill
passed by the late Congress, restraining
the importation of adulterated tea and
providing for inspectors at ports of entry,
does not mention Tacoma as one of these
ports. San Francisco, Chicago, Boston
and New York are the ones mentioned.
As considerable tea is imported via Ta
coma and quick dispatch is the great de
sideratum in the business, it is feared Ta
coma's import trade in this respect may
be creatly injured because of the non-pro
vision for inspector here. An attempt
will be made at once to have Congress
amend the law so as to include Tacoma
in the list.
ArrfteA for a laeoma Assault.
TACOMA, Wash., April 7.â R. H. Bow

persons who recently waylaid and nearly
kiiled Peter Oieson, a cattle-dealer, in
order to rob him of $500. The police say
they have strong proof against Bowman.
The preliminary hearing of the case takes
to-morrow.

Seattle Officer's Heroism
Saves the Life of a
Blind Woman.
Enters a Burning Building and
Eears the Unfortunate to
Safety.
Hairbreadth Escapes of Guests Froa
the Fire-Swept Overland
Hotel.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 7.â Seattle had
a fire visitation between 1 and 2 o'clock
this morning which came near being
most disastrous not only as regards great
destruction of property, but the loss of
lives as well. For a time it seemed that
all that section of the city south of Jack
son and for two blocks east of Commercial
street (most of the buildings being
wooden) would be destroyed by a fire
which originated in the Overland House,
from what appears to have been a coal-oil
lamp explosion.
In making their way out of the hotel
many of the guests had narrow escapes
some most miraculous ones. Antonio
Tane, an Italian, was rescued by the po-
licp, out not until he had been burned ;
until tne flesh began to drop from hia face
and hands. Physicians say he cannot re
cover, and his sufferings 'o-day have been
almost beyond human endurance.
Officer Powers found Mrs. May, an old
blind woman, prostrated from smoke in
one of the rooms on the third door of tne
house. Two stairways were burned, fall
ing in while he wrestled with his charge,
and at one time it seemed that the brave
blae coat and the woman were both
doomed. He groped around in the
dense and all but suffocating smoke until
he found a third stairway. This was
ablaze, too, but the officer, carrying the
woman in his arms, rushed down and
barely reached the sidewalk when the
stairway went down with a crash, cutting
off the last avenue of escape. Owing to
tier advanced ape it was feared that the
injuries austained, together with the
frigh;, might prove fatal, but the woman
is now out of danger.
W. N. Calder, an electrician, fell during
the progress of the tire, sustaining slight
injuries.
The Overland House, Major Edward
M. Schrack, proprietor, was destroyed
and the Salvation Army Shelter building,
in the same block, was badly damaged,
besides slight damages to adjacent struc
tures. The loss on buildings is about
$5000, with an insurance of $1000.

THE CHOICE
A SURPRISE
Kruttschnitt a Director of
the Southern Pa
cific.
MRS. STANFORD VOTED
IN PERSON.
Nearly AH of the Outstanding
Shares of Stock Were
Polled.
NO OTHER CHANGES IN THE
BOARD.
No Doubt of the Re-election of Collis
P. Huntingtoa to the Presi
dency.
Julius Kruttschnitt is the new director
of the Southern Pacific Company. He
was elected yesterday by the unanimous
vote of all who took part in the election
as the successor to A. L. Tubbs, de
ceased.
It was well understood that there would
be no change in the board of directors, ex
cept to rill the vacancy caused oy the
death of the well-known cordage manu
facturer, who was an intimate personal
friend of C. P. Huntington, and the result,
so far as the re-election of the former ten
directors is concerned, was just what was
expected.
The election was not, however, devoid
of interest. Both inside and outside the
hive of railroad employes located at the
corner of Montgomery and Market streets,
speculation has been rife as to who would
be selected as the new director, and not
once was the name of General Manager
Krattechnitt mentioned in that connec
tion. His election is, therefore, except to
a select few. somewhat of an unexpected
outcome. It had been supposed ihat, in
asmuch as the director, whose place it was
the duty of the stockholders to till, had
been a merchant, bis successor would be
chosen irom the same field of commercial
life. In justice to the gentleman upon
whom the honor has fallen it must be
stated that his election is most heartily
approved not only by every orie connected
with the sreat corporation, 'but by those
whose business brings them in contact
with the higher railroad officials.
There was but one ticket in the field,
ana not even an attempt at opposition
was manifested to it. The ticket as voted
is as follows:
The election took place during what was
nominally called the annual meetinc of
the stockholders of the Southern Pacific
Company, but at which no other business
was transacted, except the selection of a
board of eleven vi rectors for the ensuing
year. C. P. Huntington presided and Sec
retary E. C. Wright kept tally of the votes.
The polls were open from 10 a. m. to 2 p. m.
and 1,163,972.05 shares were voti-d out of a
total of 1,209,950.70 shares issued.
Mrs. Jane Stanford, escorted by Charles
G. Lathrop, her brother, ana Russell J.
Wilson, her attorney, went in person to
cast her vote. Her entry in the building
created considerable comment, but was
â¢otherwise devoid of incident. She re
mained just long enough to deposit her
ballot and pass the time of day with a few
of the directors and thun departed for her
home. Her personal interest in tbe pro
ceedings, thus displayed, is understood to
signify that she will repeat her perform
ance of last year and uave her ropresenta
tives vote for Ueneral Hubbard for presi
dent. Some say she may select Colonel
Crocker for this compliment. Both gen
tlemen are reporiea to be averse to her
using their names in this connection, but
have, under the circumstances, no power
to control her action.
None of the directors would state how !
they intended to vote for officers, of the
Southern Pacific Company to-day, but it
ia conceded that the incumbents will be
returned as follows: President, C. P.
Huntington ; vice-president, C. F. Crocker ;
second vice-president, T. 11. Hubbard;
third yice-pres:dent. J. C. Stubbs.
While Director Knittschnitt is a com
paratively new man to the people of the
Pacific Coast he is well ana favorably
Jcnown throughout the railroad world and
has been directly connected with the
Southern Pacific Company for twelve
â¼Mrs. Hi* career in his chosen vocation
Is remarkable for its uniform success in
every position of responsibility to which
be was eievated. He is yet a young man,
having not yet passed his forty-third an
niversary.
Julius Kruttschnitt was born July 30,
1854, at New Orleans, La. He attended
private pchooi for three years at that point !
from 1867 to I*7o, and entered the encin- j
eering school of Washington and LÂ«e Uni- I
versity, Lexington. Va., in the latter year, I
receiving the degree of civil engineer in
the summer of 1873. About that time
railroad work was extremely dull on ac
count of the financial throubles of that
year, and he accepted a position as assist
ant to Colonel William Allan, head of the I
engineering school of Washington and !
Lee University, from which he had just I
graduated, be having been apDointed |
principal of the Macdonough School, near
Owing,'s mill, about twelve miles from the
city of Baltimore, in Baltimore County
Md
in Uie two or three months preceding

the Southern Pacific Company*
[From his latent photograph.]
the organization of the staff of the school
he was employed by Colonel Allan per
sonally to revise and edit his lecture notes
on "Civii Engineering," which he had
made from time to time for the use of his
students at the university. These notes
were almost exclusively on Rankin's
treatises on applied mechanics and civil
engineering, and were published in W â !.
ijome time afterward these notes on
arches aud on the strength ot beams un
der transverse loads were published ab
numbers of the Van Nostrand's science
series.
He occupied the position as an assistant
in the Macdonoueh School fora period of
live years, during which he was very much
assisted in a post-graduate course of study
on professional subjects by Colonel Allan,
who, up io his death many years later,
was the warmest and most devoted of hi;
friends.
in the summer of I*7B he entered rail
j road service as resident engineer, in charge
! of the construction of sixty- four miles of
Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad, j
between Berwick Bay and Lafayette, La., |
with headquarters at Berwick, Lh. On the j
completion of the line he was made road- |
masier, and shortly afterward general
roadraaster and assistant chief engineer :
in charge of maintenance of way and
structures of the entire line from New
Orleans to Alexandria, La.
In April. 1883, he was made superin
tendent of Morgan's Louisiana and Texas j
Railroad and Steamship ComDany, wun
beadquarteis at New Orleans, his duties â 
embracing those of chief eneineer as well.
In October, 1885, shortly after the '
Southern Pacific Company acquired its I
interest in the Louisiana properties, fie
was made assistant manager to General '
Manager A. C. Hutchinson of the Atlantic ',
system.
In July. I?S9, his headquarters were
transferred to Houston, Tex., and his :
duties extended to those of general man
ager of the Atlantic system, muter wnich
tr.le the Louisiana lines were still Known, â 
and in addition was elected president of
the New YorK. Texas and Mexican Rail
way, the Gulf, Western Texas and Pacific
Railway and the Sabine and East Texas
Railway in Texav and vice-president of :
the Galveston, Harrisburg and San An- ,
tonio Kail way, and of the Texas ana New
Orleans Railroud Company.
While occupying these various positions
tiie raii lines in question were almost en
tirely reconstructed by the Southern Pa- .
cifie Company, and many improvements
to fit them for the largely increased bus:- '
ness wore de.-iirned and built under his i
supervision. Among the principal wort i
may be mentioned the ferry inclines and
terminals at New Orleans and Algiers, the
combined freight depots and warehouses i
in New Orleans, the Pecos viaduct on tbe
line of the Galveston, HHrrisburg and
ban Antonio Railway in Western TexaÂ« ;
the wood-preserving works at Houston,
Texas, and the shops at Houston, San An
tonio and El Paso, Texas. '
Following the death of A. N. Towne In
October, 1893, he whs appointed general
manneerof all lines of the Southern Pa
cllie Company, with headquarters at San
Francisco, where he now resides.
In order to make him eligible as a
director he was recently made a stock
holder of the Southern Pacific Company,
his holding being a nominal number of
shares. He was not piesent at the elec
tion yesterday and his new honor was
somewhat of a surprise to him.
A partial report of the company's busi
ness since January 1, IS9G, will be sub
mitted at the meeting to-day. The report
will show that the gross earnings for the
twelve months ending December 31 last
were $43,656,419. as ajrsinst $50,457,022 for
the calendar year 1595, or a decrease of
$1,800,003. The expenses were $31,961,916,
as compared with $33,242,398 for 1895, a de
crease of $1,280,432. The net earnings
were, therefore, $16,694,503, a decrease, as
compared with the previous vcar, of
$520,121. The decrease in net earnings
for January, as compared with the same
month of 1896, will be reported as amount
ing to $95,679.
YET WITHOUT A PASTOR
Trinity Presbyterian Churcb
Failed to Agree on
One.
The congregation of Trinity Presby
terian Church held an interesting meet
ing last night in the church edifice, corner
of Twenty-thini and Cftpp streets. Re
ports of the varioas officers showed the
affairs of the church to be in good condi
tion, $~>oo of the mortgage having been
paid off to the Hibernia Bunk since the
last report.
The election of officers was unanimous
in each case, Captain Johnson, William
Wallace and Dr. Stratton being re-elected
to succeed themselves as elders.
J. D. Jessup, John A. Weston, A. C.
Somers and Georce Brown were elected
trustees, Messrs. Somers and Brown being
re-elected.
William D. Beatty was elected deacon.
A unanimous vote of thanks were tendered
the old trustees.
On motion of Mr. Hulse it was unani
mously decided to appropriate |75 per
month for the support of a quartet choir.
The election of a pastor wa3 discussed,
with Rev. Edwin H. Jenks, associate
pastor of tho First Presbyterian Church,
in the chair a* moderator.
A. B. Cheeney introduced a resolution
allowing sick or inhrm members of the
congregation to Tote by proxy, and he
moved that upon the adoption of the reso
lution the matter of electing a pastor
should be postponed for two weeks, in
order to notify the sick and infirm of the
proxy resolution. â;*;-- v^w â¢
Mr. Cheeney's resolution was laid on
the table, and an extended discussion fol
lowed as to whether the election should
not be postponed. The subject was finally
disposed of by the adoption of Mr. Steph
ens' motion to adjourn sine die.
There are three ministers spoken of as
eligible to the pastorate: Rev. Mr.
Thompson of Tacoma, Rev. Mr. Easton of
Wnsbington, D. C, ana Rev. Mr. Larerty
of Los Angeles.

NOTES OF THE THEATERS
" Aida " Repeats Its Success
at the California
Theater.
"Wild Oats" Pieases Alcazir Audi
encesâSome of Next Week's
Bills.
i
The success of "Aida" last week at the
Cali!ornia Theater evidently induced the
people who were present to oome again
and bring their friends, for a larear audi
ence than usual welcomed VerJi's Egyp
tian opera last night.
The principals seemed to be on their
mettle to surpass their work of last week,
and the result was some brilliant acting
and singing. Massart was especially good
in the role of Rhadaraes and Mme. Foedor
as Aida and Aloers as Amonastro did
some -pienclid work.
At the conclusion of the third act these
artists received a perfect oration, and
Mme. Foedor was loaded with flowers.
Mine. Fiemau repeated her former suc
cess as Aumoris, and the other important
soio characters were satisfactorily sus
tained by Athes and Javid. The choruses
were stronger than usual and several of
the finales wers very effectively sung.
To-morrow evening the French Grand
Opera Company will give the first pro
duction here of Ambrose Thomas' "Ham
let." It will be the occasion of the grand
testimonial benefit to be tendered the
barytone, Henri Aibers, who, by his ad
mirable lyric worn during the present
season, hsis wen the admiration of music
lover?. The cast will include besides
Alber?, who will sins the title role, Mme.
Marthe Benhet, Messrs. Athes, Deo,
Javid, Benatti, etc. At the matinee on
Saturday tne company will be heard in
"Carmen."
Olis Skinner's Henii-hl3toric and wholly
reminiscent melodrama, "A Soldier of
Fortune," will give place at the Baldwin
to-night to "Hamlet," in which he made
such a favorable impression last Saturday.
Men seldom make a marked success both
as actors and playwrights, and Skinner,
who is a gifted actor, will devote most ot
the rest of his engagement to interpreting
the works of Shakespeare, who was a bet

Shakespearean plays will figure in the
Skinner season.
Mr. and Mrs. Russ Whytal have only a
few more days at the Columbia Theater
with their pretty war drama, "For Fair
Virginia."
On Monday Georgia Cayvan will open
her season with Robert Buchanan's pas
toral drama, 'Squire Kaie." This play
"fill be given during the rirst half of the
engagement, which is limited to two
weeks.
A large business is being done at the
Alcazar with "Wild Oats," whose hoary
headed jokes stem to have lost none of
their power to please in spite of their cen
tury of usefulness. The chief fun-maker
is Francis Powers, in the role of the stroll
ing player with a passion for sea
soning his conversation with quo
tations from the standard drama.
MoÂ«t of the other characters are
well sustained, though those members of
the troupe who daily with the bucolic
English dialect td'.u a fearful and wonder
ful jargon, which they must have evolved
from their inner consciousness.
"Wild Oats" is prettily staged and cos
tumed.
"The Stowaway" at Morosco's is at
tracting excellent houses, and as the cast
is exceptionally good no doubt it will con
tinue to do so. Miss Thompson, the new
soubrette, contrioutes more than her
snare to the fun of the play in the three
characters she takesâ the newsboy. But
tons and the cabin-boy. Miss Atwood
plays the heroine very prettily, and two
of the burglars am intensely business
like over the safe-cracking and hold the
auJience in breathless suspense.
"Don Juan ad Lib" will only be played
for a few more days at the Tivoli. On
Monday Sir Julius Benedict's pretty
opera, "The Lily of Killarney," is to be
produced with a strong cast and a num
ber of new scenir effects.
Titania, the toe-dancer, who made her
San Francisco debut some months ago, is
one oi the chief features at the Orpheum
this week. Sevsrai new acts are promised
for next week.
Great interest is being manifested in the
charity performance to be given in aid of

"Off the Stage."

Definite Plan for the Pure
Food Campaign
Adopted.
The Board of Health Addresses
Manufacturers on the
Subject.
Employes Pointedly Warned to Have
Tbeir Uniforms R?ady by the
15 h Inst.
The Board of Health has finally decided
on a plan of action in dealing with
offenders against the pure-food laws that,
it is believed, will meet with the ap
proval of manufacturers and consumers
and result in largely improving Iho
quality of foods sold in this market.
A meeting of the board was held yester
day to bear the report of the committee
recently appointed to consider the evi
dence before the Health Department and
formulate a plan of action. Dr. Morse
read and moved the adoption of the fol
lowing report and resolution:
Your committee on the subject of foods and
food adulterations respectfully reports that it
has had lull conferences with the various
associations iv this State concerned in the
matter of pure food and iood adulterations.
All oi the evidence anil arguments adduced
at sueii conferences were '.alien down by a
stenographer and transcribed, and your com
mittee Ims given to the subject 'he careful and
thoughtnil attention whteti Its importance de
m.-iiiij-, mways bearing in ininu the para
mount importance ol the hea.th of the con
sumer of iood while not unmindful of the
inconvenience and pecuniary loss of dealers
in food products, some ot whom may be un
witting offenders against the pure-food law.
It must be borne in mind that while the
prosecution of those who violate this law nas
been undertaken by this bonrd its enforce
ment ib uoicharged as ft special duty upon any
person or board, and the other duties of
this board and the lime and money at its dis
posal r .j'i:rc that its main labois must be de
voted to those infringements of the law
w nil h affect the health and life ol the con
sumer rather than the honesty ot the dealers.
Your committee believes that whenever and
wherever any violation of the law is discov
ered by t he board it si.onld take action, giving
such notice in those infractions of the law
which do not injure the public health as
would seem just, especially where the
breach ot the law would be without guilty
knowledge or intent.
Your committee therefore recommends the
passage of the following resolutions, the tenor
oi wmch was adopted at the Joint meeting of
the representatives ot the Men-nan is' Associa
tion, Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion and the Board of Health of ban Fran
cisco:
J.'-'dvrd, That this board proceed firstly
against the dealers In mil adulterated articles
oi iood which may be injurious or deleterious
to human lt.e or health, and Â«econdly against
tiio dealers in such articles sa may De absolute
liniuuons of, or sold lor another article, and
tulrdly against all other offenders against the
pure-food law; provided, that where articles
of food are not harmful or deleterious to hu
man life or health, and the adulteration of
such article is of such a character, or under
such circumstance?, that it cannot be discov
ered with reasonable diligence and care, due
notice shall be given by the board by publica
t:on in the daily newspapers of this City,
giving the necessary lniurmation on the
subject.
it ffu decided to instruct the chemist
of the board to make a monthly report of
his investigations under the following or
der.-:
Said report shall not contain the name of
manufacturer or dealer ol such article as may
be tuuuil noi a violation of the so-called "pure
food law," but iv such cases only the name of
she article, and the fact that same is pure,
snail be stated.
All adulterated articles in said report shall
be published in the shape of a general letter
to manufacturers, dealers and others, and said
letter shall include the names of the manu
lacturer or dealer, or agent, the article and
the result of analysis.
The following circular letter to manu
facturers and dealers was ordered sent
out:
San Franc isco, April 7, 1897.
To Manufacture* and Dealer* in Food Prod-
MCtl : T:iis lioaid of Health intends to com
bine hs ifforis to prosecute acainst adulter
ated foods oi all kinds. Many of these affect
the health of our people, others the reputation
of and demand oi our products, thus injuring
many industries of the .State. The last Board
of Supervisors appropriated a sufficient sum
to establish a chemical laboratory ana to pro
vide for a chemiM and one assistant. The
analy&es obtainable through this laboratory
are thus neoesmxlly limited, hence the work
cannot progress as fast as desirable; but we
wish to notily you that while we are at present
investigating the subject of jellies, etc.,
as rapidly as possible we shall continue the
investigation ol all foods iv general use, in
cluding all suspected articles of food, drink
and drugs, and the sooner we have at onr dis
posal a more extensive force of chemists the
quicker will we be able to lollow up the work
along the entire line.
We would suggest to dealers and retailers
that whenever they may bo i doubt regard-
Ing the purity ol any ariicle of food they take
from the wholesaler or manufacturer a guar
anty as to such purity and an indemnity
agreement should ;ae nrtic-le be found adul
terated aud so pronounced by competent au
thorities.
We dÂ«?si re to enforce the law with the least
inconvenience and loss to ail, but consumers
must be protected.
A number of communications from deal
ers whose goods were reported by the
chemist as adulterated, and from attor
neys representing other dealers who had
been arrested, were referred to the com
mittee on foods and adulterations.
Stringent rules for the icuidance of all
the employes of the Health Department
were adopted. It was ordered that all in
spectors tile daily a written report of their
doings during the day, and that this must
contain an entry of the whereabouts of
the employe at the beginning of each
hour of the day.
For some unexplained reason the chief
food inspector was instructed by the rules
to change the inspectors In the various
I stations "at least once a week.
The board brought up with a round turn
the employes of tho department who have
failed to secure uniforms, as ordered to,
in the following resolution that was
adopted:
Whkrkas, By a previous resolution of the
Board of Ucnuh, adopted at a regular meet
ing, ail inspectors and employes of the Health
Ijepartraent were directed by this board to pro
cure uniforms: and whereas, a nufficient time
has elapsed since the day of notification of said
employes of the Health Department to procure
the same; therefore, be it --â¢ â¢ .
Retolvrtl, That on and after the 15th day of
April, 1897, the positions of all employes and
inspectors who have failed to comply at the
expiration of the time mentioned with tho re
quirements of the said resolution be declared
Tficnnt without further notice on the part of
the Board of Health; and bo it
Jieeoh'td. That the chairman of the commit
tee on uniforms toe and is Hereby authorized
to carry out the provision* of this order. ;
An unsigned complaint against the Na
tional Fertilizing Company of South San
Francisco, whion was said to be in such a
condition as to be dangerous to the health
of that locality, was teferred to the coni
mitte* on uui-Â«nc<j.
Dr. John Tormey was appointed an Â«s

SOLDIERLY ATHLETICS.
The Post Field Day Held at
the Presidio Yes
terday.
Unique Events Which Attracted
Much Interest and At
tention.
Yesterday was the time for the post
poned field day at the Presidio, and before
quite a crowd of civilians and a full turn
out from the ranks a most interesting pro
gramme was carried out.
Particular interest was attached to the
event as it was the last before tha big "de
partmental" field day to be held April 18.
The distinctively military events excited
the greatest signs of appreciation. The
rescue race was one of theseâ where one
cavalryman rides toward his fallen com*
rade and bears nim away to safety. An
other was the tent pitching contest. Then
there were the dead- body rescue and the
drivers' contests for teams from the light
battery. In this three squares but a few
inches wider than the spread of the
wheels of the pieces were marked with a
stake at each corner, the squares being
fifty yards aor.rt and not in line, it was
the task of the drivers to drive through
them at full speed and without striking
the stakes.
It was not sufficient for the drivers to
go through in one direction, for after
going through a square oue way they had
to turn and go through it again from the
side. There were two drivers to each
team of four, but no men rode on tha
pieces.
The principal events were as follows:
120-yard hurdleâ Devine, Company A. First
Inlantry, first; Curley, Troop X, Fourth Cav
alry, second; Harrison, Troop J, Fourth Cav
alry, third. Time, 31 2-5 seconds.

alry. Troop H's team won in 38 1-5 seconds.
Vaulting nurcile contest, mounted bareback
over four hurdles three feet in heightâ Won by
Fernandez of Troop X, cavalry; Harrison of
Troop l second.

the day were: Dr. Edie, referee; Captain

AN ABANDONED BABE.
It WaÂ» LÂ«ft on the Doorstep of a House

A newly born baby boy was found early
yesterday morning on the doorstep of Mrs.
Hunters, a nurse, living at 3430 Sixteenth
street.
It was comfortably wrapped up in a
well-worn black pluah cape, but there was
nothing to give a clew to the identity of
its parents.
Mrs. Hunters Kept the baby till last
nicht, when she took it to the Southern
police station and from there it was taken
to the Receiving Hospital.

THE VALLEY ROAD
AND CHINA BASIN
The Harbor Commissioners
Think the Lease Is
Forfeited.
The Attorneys of the Company
Take Issue With Such
a Decision.
They Contend That tha Acceptance
of Rent Has Made the Lease
Still Valid.
It has been decided by the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners that the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road Company has forfeited its lease to
China Basin.
The opinion was reached Tuesday after
noon at the regular meeting of the board,
when Attorney Tirey L. Ford handed in
his decision on the subject, he having
spent about three months in inyestigation.
Attorney Ford's opinion was based upon
the fact that he considered the execution
of a lease to the Mercantile Trust Com
pany of New York of the property owned
by the Valley Road Company as illegal.
It was believed and so stated by him that
the transfer of any interest acquired in
China Basin rendered void the transfer
from the State. Mr. Ford concludes as
follows :
The Board of State Harbor Commissioners
cannot bind the State except bo tar aa express
legislative authority is given them bo 10 do;
nor can they, either by acts of commission or
omisiion, waive any rights reserved by
statute in the absence of any statutory
provisions for such waiver. It folows,
therefore, that no action of the board
Is necessary In the premises go far as the
preservation of the rights of the State is con
cerned If at any time in the future the State
should desire to take possession of the leased
property prior to the termination of the lease
in quest. on, then, li objection were made
thereto by the lessee or by any one claiming
an interest therein, tno question would
properly arise.
The attorneys of the Valley Road Com
pany take decided issue on th* question
with Mr. Ford, and do not believe that
in any way has the company forfeited its
lease. Moreover, they hold that the regu
lar acceptance of rent by thn State would
make the lease stand valid now even if it
bad been forfeited.
The Harbor Commissioners are a little
shaky on the subject of rent, as may be
seen by an interview with Commissioner
Colnon last evening. He said:
"I asked Attorney Ford to see whether
the acceptance of the rent by the Harbor
Commissioners for the current year
would in any way affect the status of the
case and he is to loos the matter up and
report to us later. If they have no legal
rignt to China Basin there ijrno reason
why they should be paying rent for it."

Big Feed on the Boulevard,
to Which the Workers
Were Denied.
It Was Spread Out Before Them,
but Under Orders Tfcey
Relused to Eat.
Many Had Neglected to Brin? Lunches
Under Promise of the Barb cue.
Others Shared With These.
There wi< to have been a great feed for
the workmen on Balboa boulevard yester
day at noon, but it was "called off."
There bad been a good deal said about the
barbecue one way or another during the
pas: few days, and among the men great
expectations had been raised. The effect
upon the comniitiee whoi>Â« unpleasant
t ..siness it is to secure sublet iptions wav,
however, quite different. 1 bey report
ihat merchants and moneyed men seemed
10 gather the impression that the affair
was a b g advertising a.heme for Earnest
I>oelter, proprie or of the Trocadero road
house, by whom it was provided anÂ«i in
iront of whose premises the big roast was
fret up. The mÂ«mbi>ri of the committee
found, they say, that the picnic air which
the barbecue gave to the boulevard enter
prise very materially lowereJ the temper
ature of pub.ic interest in it aud the un
employed.
Accorduiely a telephone messace was
sent to Doelter yeÂ«ierday. but it did not
reach him. He had completed all ar
rangements Tuesday evening. A big
trench was dug nÂ»ar the s de of thÂ° road
where it leads off :o ihe Trocadero and
the roadhouse, whicii latter, trowever, is
half h tulle awuy. '* i) ree or four lengths
ot iron rails were thrown across the
trench and on these ihe quaitered buj
iock was placed and a big fir*" ouiit under
it. The tire ourned night, beine per
sonally attended by Doelterand hiÃ assist
ants. Not until nearly noon was the tire
withdrawn. .Bread and potatoes and
hard-boiled e^t:s were provided iv ampie
sufficiency, 'i hen came a telephone mes
sage to the nftice of Superintendent Eiman
from member* of the committee in the
City telling him to stop tlie barbecue â
that the movement fur the relief of the
uni-mployed rouÂ«t not iend itself to ad
vertising the Trocadero roadhouse.
The only wav to stop it was to abso
lutely !orb d any mun From partaking of
the feast upon pain of being discharged
and having hin work-ticket taken from j
him.
On ibis rather distressing mission rode
Superintendent Eagan all down th- line.
At each -qu.ul lie stopped and explained
the reason â that it threatened to interfere '
with the raising or money to continue the J
work. Besides, it as explained, the men
at the further end of the line, two miles
away, could hardiy get to the least and
back a tram during the lunch half hour.
This explanation was received in good part
by nearly all, although many, depending
upon the feast, had come unprovided with
anything to eat.
At the western end of the road, where
the savory meat rested over the lire, fill
ing the air with its appetizing aroma, the
order was anything but welcome. How
ever it was generally acquiesced in, de
spite*the-fact, mat two or three oratop
were developed who complained loudly
against- the deprivation. The situation
was made more acute by the presence Â»f
Leffinjjwell's army of unemployed from
the Howard-street barracks. They hid
marched all the way out to the place an
fool, carrying a big banner in their lead
bearing tne legend: "We are not on me
boulevard, but we are going to the botile
vard."
They were stretched alona the fence in
the shade for a quarter oi a mile, the tan
ner lying at rest against a tree, the sen
quiet, very weary and patient.

fire and the completion of his amnge

â which he offered to haul portions #f the
fenst to different parts of the work, was
deeply chagrined at the order stopping it
all. However, he made no protest against
it, but aÂ«>Â«e:tea that he had no designs in
the matter except to give tiM men & good
hot dinner. They were hardly of the
ciass tuat frequented his place, md tie
could not expect to make profit oit of it.
However, he made the beÂ«t of thÂ« situa
tion, the word wa- given, and tie "un
employed,'' properly so called, we<! mar
shaled before he redolent roast aid pro-
Tided with each an ami'-e quota.
At this juncture the murmurinf among
the workmen on the dump a few feet
away grew louder, and one, seeiEg Super
intendent Ea^'iin drive up, raisec his tiat,
crying: "If you fellows are ai:aid lam
not. lam going to snow my iidepend
ence. I am go:ne to eat. Eagtn, come
and take much with me."
He went straight into the chained cir
cie, in the center of which stood Doelter,
coat off and sleeve* rolled up hard at
â¢work, ana in a few minutaa renirne<i with
a heaped plate into the doiefd circle of
his feliow-workers to add to their tempta
tion. Only one or two followd his ex
ample, however, the others stoically re
fusing to fall. Those who ate Â«f the for
bidden bulloc* were, so nnlke Adam,
banished and forbidden the rare privilege
of toil, and went their way in idleness.
In the fear that there woid he a gen

j Jack Hallinas N,w at Rest, EsUb- j
lisbed This R sort as the
Cremorne Theater.
The tawdry place of entertainment now '
known as the Midway P.aisance, formerly
called the Cremorne Theater, is to be j
closed. That matter was settled by the
verdict of a jury in Judge Hunt's court
yesterday, when there was reudered a
verdict in Javor of John W. Mackay, the I
The Condemned Midway Plaisance, Market Street.
great mining and telegraphic magnate,
against Ed war I Homan, lmnressuno of
talent In questionable plays and doubtful
leg opera.
The judgment of the court is for $300
rent and possession of the premises at 771
Market Mreet within three day*.
The late Jack Hallinan was the
originator of the Creraorne Theater, and
it was to rum that Mackay rented the
place, probably more as a mailer of
friendship than as a business proposition.
Hallinan was a journeyman Dlncksmith
on ihe Comsturk odÂ« in the early '70s.
and, having an aptitude for boxing*, soon
developed into a pr'z--tighter.
From prizf-fixhting io politics was an
easy transition in tnose eariy days, ac
cording to gossip current in Virginia City
at that time, ami something tact HÂ«l
--linan did in some local contest aroused
Mackny's wrath. It was said that in con
sequence of thai fit of anger the multi
millionaire conceived the idea of bringing
to theConiÂ«tcck a boxer who could defeat
Hallinan in the rinc and thus punish him
for his temerity in opposing tlie political
friends of the big bonanza manipulators.
Soon afterward Billy .Lynn of Eureka
made his appearance, and a contest was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1897.
speedily agreed on for a big purse and nil
the ga;e receipts, lor it was "make or
break" with the fijrhters in those times.
On tne night of the tight enthusiasm
knew no bound*. It wasevidom from the
start that the mm were very evenly
matched, though Lynn seemed to sur
pass Hallinan in legerdemain. What
Hallinan lacked in dexterity he mane up
in surpassing pluck, however, and this
won him the i.vise. and much more, as
the outcome will show.
After the mill had been in progress a
great many rounds Lynn began to show
over-con tidence, and danced about the
ring in fantastic fashion, making grim
aces and "showine off" nil cleverness by
"chopping" his adversary about when
ever he felt like it.
The old London prize ring rules were in
vogue, and Jack was snowing signs of dis
tress from the blows thai had been so gen
erously bestowed by Lynn. Everybody
thought his defeat was inevitable, but
there was some steam left In the Comstock
boy and he waited for his chance. He
took his punishment with the stolidity of
a wooden Indian, and finally, when Billy
in contemptuous guise threw out his face
as a targe:, Juck shot out his rigut and
reached Lynn's chin.
It proved to be the proper "point" and
was as effective a<< tue blow over the heart
which General Fizs;mmons reCwntly de
livered with hid compliments to Colonel
Gorbett
Lynns' backers were unable to lesusci
tate the "champion from the Base Range"
and Hallinan was the hero of the hour.
He captured the respect of all by his dis
play of true grit and John Mackay, being
of a generous niture, not oniv forgave h:s
erstwhile enemy but bestowed on mm his
respect and his friendship. A man who
could face fate when the chances seemed
I to be so tremendously against him would
do to trust. From that day Jack Halli
nan nÂ«ver lacked tor financial backing,
and be it said to his credit he proved
worthy of the confidence of thot>e who
trusted him in business matters.
Hallinan bad a bie iaro Kfnie in Vir
ginia City, in partnership with the late
Jonn P. tiwecney, with n cock-fi;:hling
addendum. After the boom ha; passed
Hallinan removed to San Francisco and
engaged in the only kind ot biuiness ihat
he was able to successfully manage
Maek'ty, of course, never approved the
u^s to which his Market-Street property
was p.it, but interposed no veto until the
business passed into the hands ot others.
Mr.-. Hallinan, widow of ihe original
owner, appeared In court yesterday with
a claim to nn interest in the Midway <-n
urpri.se, aliening that sat had paid $450 to
Homan for her share, tinee the commence
merit of the litigation, but it was decided
tuut she was too late, and that she had no
lejral basis for her contention; that she
ought to have been made a party defend
ant; that she knew there was trouble
about tlie rent, and that it was her duty to
make liiquirit-s for her own self- protection.
The Sheriff will be asked to dispossess
Homan as soon as that process can be
legally accomplished.

Of.
William H. Jor^n's Talk on Cub)
at the Evening Ses
sicn.
The second day's session of the Grand
Lodge of the Ancfent Oraer ot United
Workmen was well attended yesterday
and much legislative work was done by
the committees appointed lor that pur
pose.
The following committees were ap
pointed at the opening of the morning's
session :
Good of the orderâ William H. Jordan. P. S.
M. W. ; K. F. Joy, J. M. Graves, J. H. Block, F.
I Farley.
Resolutionsâ A. R. Orr, C. H. KellogK, J. M.

Special 2â J. A. Love Joy, I. Horton, W. 11.
Savage.
Special 3â T. 11. Merry, aB. Burkham, J. G.
Underwood.
A recommendation was made that the
necessary expenses incurred by deputies
in visiting lodges be paid by the Grand
Lodge when an item zed claim (or the
Mine shall be made. Trie charter for new
lodges has been reduce. i from $20 to $5.
Lodges meeting semi-monthly may call
special meetings, admit candidates and
confer degree*.
All of the dispensations granted by the
grand master workman during the past
year were confirmed.
The value of tbÂ«s press and of the official
ortran was emt hatically enunciated, It
was recommended that the memorial day
of the order be regularly observed.
Twenty-six new loupes were reported.
i It was decided to continue the v eof
an official organ for the order, but the
name 01 the journal was omitted.
The amount of $15,000 was appropriated
for extension work, unit also tne per
capita tax was fixed at $2 50 par year, to
De paid quarterly. The grand medical
examiner's fee was reduced from 50 cents
to '25.
The question of holding: biennial ses
sions failed to pasi, it not getting the
requisite :wo-thirds vote necessary to
amend the constitution.
It was a rare tr^at that was afforded the
membert of the Grand Lodge ami V!Â»iting
Workmen at D'nai B'rith Hall last nigni,
who gathered to listen to the tenure on
"Cuba and the War" by Past Supreme
Matter William H. Jordan. The enter
tainment was under the auspices of the
Past Masters' Association and was at
tended by an audience that filled t tie hall.
Past Suprpme MaÂ»ter Jordan's lecture
waÂ« aividnl into three pans, the first and
last being illustrated with striking stere
opticon views. He first spoke of the past
history of Cuba and of its many places of
interest and note, from the tanning of Co
lumbus to the execution of t a-. tain Frye
or the American steamer Virgmius and
his gallant crew.
Then he be::an an eloquent recital of
the present struggle, and said he wished
to a>-k the American people two questions.
One w;is: 'Shall the Government 01 Spain
be permitted in the faco of existing tr.-atv
â¢tipuiations t- arrest and condemn Ameri
can citizens without trial â to imprison
and murder American citizen*?" HÂ«
stated that this was continually done and
ouebt to bt stopped at whatever cos', so
that American ciizens might be confident
o'. protection and respect in whatever part
of the world th^y mipht chance to be.
His second question wus, ''Shall the
island of Cuba, shali the Cuban patriots
be permitted now to set up housekeeping
for themselves and so govern themselves
ndependently of the Government of
ipnin?"
Hp declared that the insnreents had
ample cause to rebel against the rule of
Spain. While nominally the Cubans had
a voice in framing their laws and tiling
their taxes, they were, by the cunning
manipulation of the voting franchise oy
ihet-piniso ollicials on the island, in re
ality deprived of their rightt.
He quoted figures to show how by means
ol import ana export dntie* Spain drained
annually from Cuba between $20,000,000
and $22,000,000. Tne taxes of the bland
were irom $26 000,000 to $30,00-3,000, and
most of this, he declared, went to repair
the lost fortunes of profligate sons of Span
ish noblemen, who were appointed to lu
crative Government positions in Cuba.
This tax, he pointed out, was raised to
maintain a government for 1,631.000 peo
ple, while in the United States, with its
population of 70,000,000, the total tax per
annum was in ( he neighborhood of $77,
--000,000. He further contrasted conditions
in this country and oppressed Cuba by
ca'ling attention to the fact that the tax
per capita in the United States was only
$1 23, while in Cuba it was $23 40. No peo
ple on the fee* of the earth, he said, bad
to pay the tax Imposed on the people of
Cuba.

ALAMEDA MOLE
TO BE FILLED IN
A Big Improvement Pro
jected by ths Railroad
Company.
President Huntington Will In
spect the Work When It
Is Begun.
One Mi Â© and a Quarter of Trestle
to Bs Entire;? Dono Away
With Shortly.
Sinca Collis P. Huntington, the euiflinjt
spirit of the great Soutiiorn Pacific Com
pany, reacned this coast on liis recent
trip there has been a hurrying up of im
portant improvements on tue corpora
tion's lines, and several big enterprises
have been projected.
One of the heaviest of the-e will be
begun within a few day* on the Oakland
and Alameda narrow-gauge mole, on
which many thousands of dollars will be
spent. The plan is to make a solid stone
and earth roadbed f oru the present shore
line to where the deep-water mark has
been established by a breakwater.
The materials pumped out of Oakland
Greek when that watercourse was recently
dredged filled in a portion of the marsii
beneath the tre-uLe that has dono s-ervice
for so many year?, and this debris will
form the foundation for the substantial
roadbed that has lone been contemplated
and which will soon be a reality.
The company experimented with filling
in under a trestle and putting the ra-.la on
a solid bed witli the short trestle between
Pacific-street and Second-avvnue stations
on the AlameUa line, and the result was
very satisfactory, the piles holding she
rock and earth remarkably well and soon
cementing into a solid mass that has de
fied the waters of tue bay ever since.
For some lime pust a big Rang of men
has been at work at Campbells station,
just beyond San Jose, where '.be company
uas an immense pravel pit, preparing to
take out v large quantity of material, and
at the same time engineers have been
looking over the ground to be tilled and
ballasted, with a view io ascertaining the
exact amount of rock that will be needed.
Superintendent Frasier 01 the division
to which the mote and its trucks belong
went over tbe ground a few days ago with
a party of railroad engineers, and Mr.
Huntington is expected to look into the
matter personally when the work begin?.
The mik- and a quurter of trestles that
is to be filled in will require many thou
sands ot tons of rock to brine the road bed
up to the desired level and two trainn will
be kept constantly at work conveying rock
until the job ib complete.
One of tne most potent reasons that in
duced t lie company to 'Jo away with the
trestle was ihe impossibility of muking the
piles stay in any desired position. The
: sand into which they are driven ia of such
j a character that they are constantly sink
{ ing and causing the track to sai; in spots
I in a manner that renders travel uncom
j fortabia if not dangerous. Tlioussnds of
; dollars have been spent in keeping tbe
! track level.
The reason the company does not fill
further out than the distance mentioned
is that the Government claims jurisdic
tion and no clash lsdesirea by ttie railroad
people.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The only harmonious concert on the
Cretan question is that ot public opinion.
It is an off year in nearly every city
election this time, but in Chicago it was
a way off.
Yon can stop the Democratic crow over
the result in Chicago by calling atten
tion to St. Louis.

Interior papers which complain that the

One set of Democrats declare the Ding
ley tariff will not yield a revenue equal to
the needs of the Government, while an
other set asserts it will create a surplus
and overbarden the people with taxation.
The average Democratic editor seems to
belong by turns to each of these sets and
not infrequently makes both assertions in
consecutive sentences.
Greater New York is so proud of itself
that it wishes to be transformed into a

to that end, but it will not go far before it

Chicago will demand the same proud po

The tariff which is to give work to wage

they object. Each schedule assures pro

traders cannot pick; out the particular one
which they wish to destroy.
The Examiner says of the Dingley bill:
"The most reactionary, most barbarous,
the most stupidly, wantonly and meddle

American legislation." Tbti is the way

pat an end to the Democratic deficit, pro
tect American industry and add $300,000.

among the wicked there is weeping and
wailing and gnashing of teeth.
THE CITY ELECTIONS.
Mr. Bryan has telegraphed to Carter
Harrison, the successful Democratic can
didate for Mayor of Chicago: "Accept
congratulations upon your magnificent
victory. The elections in Chicaeo, Cin
cinnati, Detroit and other cities indicate a
decided change in public sentiment since
November."
It will be seen from this telegram that
Bryan is laying to his soul the flattering
unction that the vote in Chicago means
that a large number of citizens have be
come dissatisfied with the vutes they cast
in November, and that if they bad the
chance again they would now vote for
him instead of McKinley. This opinion
is confined to Mr. Bryan himself. It is
certainly not shared by Carter Harrison,
who in an interview stated that hia vic
tory was the result of n united and not a
divided Democracy. "Gold as well as sil
ver men," he eaid, "cast their ballots for
me." There is no comfort in that state
ment for Mr. Bryan, lor if Bryan repre
sents anything at all he represents a di-
vided and not the united Democracy
which was successful at Chicago.
Nothing is more futile and foolish than
this effort of the discredited leader of the
Democratic and Populist fusion to misrep
resent the result of the election- 1 in East
ern cities so as to make them show a
change in public sentiment on the issues
which were submitted to the people in
November. City elections are always de
termined by local issue?. The Republi
can party in Chicago was hopelessly di
vided. The aivisions, however, were
occasioned wholly on matters of local
politics. National affairs had nothing
whatever to do with them. There was no
contest concerning the tariff, the money
question or any other great National pol
icy. The fiÃht was a purely local ono and
the Democratic candiuate succeeded sim
ply because his opponents were divided
while his own supporters were thorouishly
united, aggressive and determined to win.
Whatever comfort the old Democratic
party may draw from the result in
some of the cities where elections have
been held the Popocratic fusion party
can find none. The only city in which
an effort was made to continue their
fu-ion in the local elections was
in St. Lotiis, and there it resulted in a dis
astrous failure. St. Louis is normally a
Btrongly Democratic community. In the
recent election an attempt was made to
bring the gold wing of Democracy into
harmony with the silver and the Populist
wing, but the result was that the nearer
they "got together" the more antagonistic
they became. Harmony was impossible.
The fusion went to pieces and the party
went to defeat.
Even the most casual study of the re
turns from the various cities will show that
the Bryan movement had nothing what
ever to do with the temporary Democratic
successes. Mr. Bryan may natter himself
that hi-Â» prospects have been brightened
by the vote, but he will rind himself mis
taken. There has been no change in pub
lic sentiment since November.
WE ABE NOT PROVINCIAL.
We observe with considerable astonish
ment t at some of the interior newspapers
of the State are seriously indisposed
toward printing anything cheerful about
the Carnival of the Golden Gate. They
appear to be gathering the folds of their
kirtles about them preparatory to a grim
withdrawal from the scene of festivities.
And, glancing back over their Bhoulders
as they slowly recede, they display a
countenance more in sorrow than in
angerâ an expression of reproach blended
with renunciation. They would have en
joyed remuining and mingling in the
happy talk wnich must surely precede and
follow the gala occasion that awaits us;
but they feel that they have been wronged,
that distinctions have been practiced to
their disadvantage, and that they must
out of pure self-respect resent the slight
and assert their independence.
Tne whole difficulty seems to lie in the
circumstanco that paid advertisements oi
the carnival have not beeu sent out to
them, whereas me San Francisco papers
have received advertisements of carnivals
that have been held in the interior. In
this arrangement these interior journals
fail lo discern that spirit of reciprocity
which unites all eood brotherhood and in
spires fraternal endeavor for a common
cause. They contend that they have done
enough free talking for San Francisco,
while the San Francisco papers have been
in a measure recompensed for their outlay
of space, time and talents by patronage
for their advertising columns. They pro
pose, regretfully but firmly, to do no nioie
of it.
The Call trusts that these of its interior
contemporaries will accord it the credit at
least ot sincerity in this matter when it
ventures to remonstrate with them. We do
not believe that they are taking a broad
view of the situation. It seems exceed
ingly Drovincial. The San Francisco
morning papers are national publications
â they are not got up to cover merely
the events of a single city, or single neigh
borhood. They cater to all sections and
correspondingly draw upon all sections
for support. Probably it requires as much
money to run one of them a month as it
requires to run for a like period all the
interior papers in the State combined,
barring a few in some of the larger cities.
It would be impractical for a paper like
The Call to depend entirely upon San
Francisco for its support, although San
Francisco furnishes more patronage in
proportion to its readers than the interior
does.
So interior carnival can possibly do bet
ter than to advertise in the metropolitan
press, from a simple business point of
view. In no other way can so many read
ers be reached, and particularly those leis
urely readers who are the most likely to
flit away into the country for a few days
of carnival. The press of this City goes
all over the country and is read all over
the country. Why should not the inte
rior carnival committees embrace so supe
rior a service as a cool, practical proposi
tion? It costs lest to advertise in a few
big Journals than to advertise in a thou
sand smaller ones. Suppose the Golden
Gate Carnival committee should under
take to advertise In the interior press.
Where would it get off? How many ad
vertisements would it have to issue?
Could it discriminate and advertise In
only the Los Angeles, Sacramento, San
Jose and Stockton papers? Manifestly
not, since thÂ« papers of other cities, and
the papers of every remote corner and dis
tant mountain pocket in the whole State
would have just as good a cause for com
plaint in that event as they have in the
present one and just as cood cause aa the
paperi of Los Angeles, Sacramento, San
Jose and Stockton have in the present
also.
The whole truth is that there is no
thought of making distinctionsâ no con
sciousness of slighting anyone or favor
ing any set of papersâ in the bestowal of
advertising. It is, we repeat, a business
pioposition. Aad the big metropolitan
dailies are as much California dailies as
they are San Francisco dailies. They are
the only dailies, in fact, which cover the
whole State and are recognized as the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1897.
mouthpieces of entire California at home
and abroad.
The Call hones that its interior friends
will not permit their hasty resolution to
last in view of this dispassionate presen
tation of common-sense consideiations.
They tnnst not regard us as provincially
San Franciscan â we speak for the State,
the country, the world. And San Fran
cisco's carnival is California's carnival
also. There should be no jealousies in
this beautiful State, which is our common
heritage and the very be*t heritage that
any people ever were blest with. The
Golden Gate Carnival will be in honor of
and a tribute to the Golden State, and we
should all work to make it worthy of that
object.
DfiEARY IMBECILITY.
â¢ "The Democratic criticisms of the new
tariff," says the Inter Ocean, "are drearily
imbecile." The language is strong, but
what else can be said of criticisms that
are essentially imbecile in argument and
most vapidly dreary in language. No
other phrase can so accurately present the
exact nature of the attacks which the
free-trade orators and organs are now
making upon the bill which is designed to
provide protection for our industries and
an adequate revenue for our Government.
The Examiner of yesterday furnished an
example of these criticisms. It declared
the Dingley tariff to be "the most reac
tionary, the most barbarous, the most
stupidly, wantonly and meddlesomely op
preÂ«sive in the wbofe history of American
fi-cal legislation." These statements
made in the face of facts so well known to
the people are certainly to be character
ized by no other phrase than that used by
the Inter Ocean.
HÂ»d the language of the Examiner been
applied to the Wilson tariff, the people
would have recognized it as a fairly ac
curate statement of the truth. That tariff
nearly bankrupted the Government, com
pelled four bond issues to raise money,
and imposed upon the people a burden of
principal and interest which, belore it is
paid off, will cost the Government over
$5' 0,000,001 The Dingley tariff, on the
contrary, provides a revenue sufficient to
meet the needs of the Government and to
pay off the debt imposed by the Demo
cratic tariff. It will open a way, more
over, for the annual payment of $300,000,000
in wages to American labor.
The New York Sun has said: "The
tariff reformers made such a fist of it
with their lying and disastrous Wilson
tariff, that, for very shame they now
should cease from boring the public with
their dreary preaching." This statement
of the Sun wo recommend to the Examiner
and all other free-trade organs in the
country. P 'Op!e have grown weary of the
cry that a tariff is a tax and that protec
tion fosers trusts. Tuey have had ex
perience with both kinds of tariffs, and
they desire a return to the protection
which is embodied in the Dingley bill.
The Republican National platform
clearly expressed public sentiment on this
subject In saying, "The country demands
a right settlement and then it wants
rest." The right settlement is furnished
by the Dingley tarift, which wa< supponed
in the House not only by all Republican
members but by several, of trie most pro
gressive Democrats from the South. The
next tiling demanded is rest. Above all
the people desire rest from dreary imbe
cility ot criticism.
SIGNS OF BETTER TIMES.
While the revival ef industry from the
depression caused by the Democratic
tariff is slow, as was foreseen by all in
telligent men, it is, nevertheless, progress
ing steadily, and in no part of the Union
are signs lacking that the hard times are
passing away, and better conditions re
turning to all classes of trade and in
dustry.
We called attention a short time ago to
the statement of Factory Inspector Camp
bell of Pennsylvania that 100,000 more
persons are at work in that State now
than there were six months ago. This in
itself shows a notable improvement in in
dustrial conditions, since it i? clear that if
there has been such a large increase in
employment in one State of the Union,
there must be a similar improvement in
other communities.
Rflports from the Southern States an
nounce the erection there of a large num
ber of new cotton-mills and the enlarge
ment of those already in operation. Along
the lake States there are developments in
the construction of commercial buildings
of all sorts, and some of them are of quite
a notable character. One of these is the
beginning of the erection at Buffalo of a
steel elevator with a capacity of 3,000,0C0
bushels. An elevator of steel is some
thing in the way of an experiment, and il
it proves successful will lead to the erec
tion of a iarge number of others of the
same kind, so that the time may not be
far distant when the old-fashioned wooden
elevator will cease to exist.
The largo orders which have been given
for steel rails assure an immediate con
struction of a large number of new rail
roads or the repair of old ones. It is said
that the orders sent in for rails during the
first two months of this year exceeded the
total amount of orders given during the
whole twelve months of 1896. Theoutlook
for the steel and iron industry, therefore,
is better than it has been since the Wilson
tariff was enacted, and as the iron and
steel industry has ever been reearded as a
Bafe standard for measuring the business
prosperity of the country, it becomes evi
dent that the revival is going on
much faster than some pessimists would
have us believe.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Especial attention is called this week to two
Vienna masters of very different kinds of
musicâ Johannes Brahms and Johann Strauss.
While the Waltz King has been triumphing at
the Theater an der Wien, in the seventy-third
year of his age, with a new operetta, as bril
liant as anything he ever wrote, Johannes
Brahms, aged 04, has ended his musical labors
after a long and painful illness. Brahms
worked in every important style of composi
tion excepting the operatic. Opera and matri
mony he avoided with equal persistency. He
shared with Beethoven the degree of M. 8.,
Bachelor of Music "With mirriage," he once
said, "it is as witn opera. If 1 had already
composed an opera and, for al l care, seen it
fail, I would certainly write another. But I
can't make up my mind to a first marriage or
a first opera." The theater simply had no at
traction for him. Not infrequently he
would rise to leave after the first
act of an opera, with the remarK
to his companion: "You kuow I understand
nothing about the theater." Brahms thought
In the recognized classic musical forms of
JOHANNES BRAHMS, Who Avoided Operas and Matrimony.
which he was not a slave but a master. He
gave modern significance to classical forms.
It was Schumann who first enthusiastically re
cgnized his (teniuÂ«, and It was to Schumann
that he wrote In 1855 saying how distasteful
it was to him to rÂ« dragged into the war
against Wagner. Many pfople have judged
Brahms' music unjustly because of liis mij>
posed opposition to the Bayreuth master, but
Baoslick says that no one was more familiar
with Wagner's scores than Brahms, and that
he often beard Brahms defend Wagner aguinst
hostile critic.sm. Wegnerians, however, were
never able to forget that caustic saying of
Wagner's, "Brahms is a oinposer whose
importance lies in not wishing to create any
startling effects."
The first production of "The Goddess of
Reason," Johann Strauss' new operetta, has
created quite a sensation in Vienna, for on the
banks of the Danube nil the compositions of
the popular master pass for chefs d'oauvre.
Without going quite so far as to bolieve that,
there teems no reason to doubt that Strauss'
now operatta, which is running at ihe Theater
an der Wien, is worthy of most of the flattering
things that the Vienna press snys about it.
Strauss was struck with a strange idea, though,
when he sought the motive for gay waltzes in
the most somber period of the French Revolu
tion. The action passes in the year 17U3,
partly in the camp at Chalons, and partly in a
pentionnat. The music from one cud to the
other of 'The Goddess of Reason" is as full of
ruelody as If Sirauss was in the vigor of his
days, instead of having passe i his seventy
second birthday. There was only one shadow
on the brightness of the first night's success â
Strfiuss was prevented by illness from attend
ing the Dcrformance.
Apropos of to-morrow night's first perform
ance oi AmbroUe Thomas' "Hamlet" in this
City one may tell a story, which M. G. Bourdon
has been relating in the Paris Figaro: One
day, in the month of October, 1807, Ambroise
Thomas was walking slowly and pensively
down the Rue Vivienue. Editor lleugel. from
the back part of his store, saw him pass ai:<i
called out,' "En bien! what's the news? '"Hut!
a big machine that 1 have just finished in the
country." "Show it me." Ambroise Thomas,
whose memory was prodigious, went to the
piano in the music publisher's study and for
two hours played his big machine. It was the
score of "Hamlet," that lor eight montns
he had petted, caressed and coaxed. It
marked a stage in his artistic life.
For tho first time he was trying to escape
from the tensor graces of "Songe dune
Hvit d'ete" of "Psyche" and of "Mignon," and
was trying to get to the heights of grand
music. "It for the Grand Opera, heln, and
righi away," said Heugel. "Oh, no! no!" re
plied Thomas. "Give me first an Ophelia, and
then we shall see." At this moment a pretty
blonde girl showed her head, which looked
like a pastel painting through the half-open
aoor, exclaiming "Bonjour!" "Nilsson !" said
Heugel. "But la vollal your Ophelia." And,
in effect, it was the Swedish cantatriee who
triumphantly created the role. As for Ham
let, it is not generally known that the role
was first written for a tenor, but that it was
decided to give it to the incomparable bary
tone Faurc. This necessitated the rewriting
of ail the score in the version which was per
formed and published.
At Genoa, Italy, the other aay a grand con
cert was given for the benefit of the Cretan
Insurgents. After many contretemps and
obstacles raised by the authorities the concert
finally took place in the Po'iteama Genovese,
which was crowded. The principal attraction
was the Tzigane Rigo, who executed several
violin solos, among others a piece entitled
"Viennese Follies" and a "Hungarian Rhap
sody." In spite of the rumors that Rigo and
the Princoss de Caraman-Chimay never speak
as they pass by the Princess was In the first
row of the audience elegantly dressed in pink.
Augusts Van Blene, the actor 'cellist, who
has been giving himself such airs in New
York, professes to have undergone terrible
privations In his early days. At one time he
wos alone, friendless and penniless, in London
and only a feeling of ambition kept him from
despair. "One day, when I was both hungry
and fad," he says, "I heard a man singing in
the street. At the same inntant, owing to a
rush of warm air from the window, I smolt
the odor of a dinner cooking. Suddenly I
formed a resolution. I borrowed a stool from
my landlaay and, with my violoncello under
my arm, I went into the street." Van Biene
played all that day, and on several succeeding
ones, for coppers on the street and his takings
averaged from 5 shillings to 2o shillings a day
($1 to $4). One aay he was addressed by a
gentleman who asked why he was playing on
the street. "For bread," he replied. The
[ slanger gave him a card, telling him to call
I the next day. It bore the name of Costa, and
j that was the origin of his engagement in Sir
I Michael Costa's orchestra at Covent Garden.
The paper Yon Fels zum Meer recently pub
lished some of Rubinsieiu's private memoirs,
which the master kept locked in his desk dur
ing his lifetime, because he did not want to
engage in any controversy by letting his
friends see them. Here are some of his opin
ions : "When musical thoughts are lacking then
the lie tmotiv comes in handy. " "There used
to be little concert halls and great artists, now
there are great concert halls, but .'"' "An
artist who gives a concert wishes lo learn the
judgment of the pubic on his performance.
The easiest way would be, instead of charging
the public for admission, to ask them at the
end for such contribut ions as they thought he
deserved. This would be a test of the ap
plause, and would check the flood of coucerts."
Ern;ie Zola has heralded the libretto of the
new Zola-Bruneau opera "Messedor" to the
world as ''the first book of the future lyric
drama of France." The critics aro not of the
same opinion. They say that Bruneau has
written a score of alluring power, but that it
is to be regret'dl that he score*! the trivial
realism of thu language used by Zola's peas
ant*. Imagine setting to music sue.i words as
"Eli, my friend, is it forbiduen to have more
intpiligeme and activity than the others?"
It dues not jeem as if excessive realism were
much better than the books of the old Italian
operas.
The Philharmonic Orchestra of Berlin, con
ducted by Arthur Nikisch, late of Boston, is go
ing to try its fortune in Paris next month at
the Cirque d'hiver. No doubt the favorable
reception given to Felix Mottl of Carlsbad and

turn its back on musical art because it comes
from the other side of the Rhine.
Hubcrman, the boy violinist, was recently
interviewed for a musical paper. When

INVENTED "LOG ROLLING"
Wftshlngton Post.
Judge Holman says that ex-J|enator Sawyer
of Wisconsin invented "log rolling" in legisla
tion and that he is responsible for the waste
of more public money than any llvin* man In
the United States. "Sawyer is to blame for
these outrageous river and harbor bills," ex
claimed the venerable economist from Indian*.
"He was chairman of the Committee on Com
merce in the House of Representatives thirty
five years ago, and in order to get money for
rivers and harbors and harbors in Wisconsin
he divided the pie all round. Before Sawyer's

Just as public buildings are authorized now,
and when a bill for improving a harbor at
Oshkcsh came up all the Southern and Kast
em people would vote against it because that
town was not in their district, and vice versa.
So Sawyer conceived the id^aof pooling Issues,
and he used to make uo bills containing thirty
or forty appropriations for different places in
various parts of the country so as to get votes
enough to pass them and neutralize the oppo
sition. I have often told Sawyer that he ccst

The Veterans of General Head* Post.
O. A. R. , Entertained by the
Meade Relief Oorpa.
It was remarked at an assemblage of mem
bers of General Meaile Post, G. A. R., and
ladies of General Meade Relief Corps that
while all the younger people and orders were
being rushed to the front, the old veterans
who fought to save the Union are almost for
gotten and scarcely thought of; but that the
time will come, in future generations, when
the people will look bacs: and trace the family
tree for the honor of being called a descend
ant of a Union soldier of the War of the Re
bellion. â  This is true of many who claim to be
filed with patriotism, but there is one organ
izatton th*t does not forget the old soldiers
of General Meade Post, and that one is Gen
eral Meade Relief Corps, which was organized
eight years ago to work in conjunction with
the post. Once a year the ladles of this corps
visit the veterans and entertain them with
music, song and a banquet. This was done
last Tuesday night in Foresters' Hall, on the
occasion of the corps' anniversary, and the
men who carried the muskets to preserve the
country as one were sensibly affected by the

HONOR TO
A MARTYR
Lincoln's Monument Is
Now Certain to Be
Erected.
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE
. PARK SITE.
An Encouraging Letter From
Robert T. Lincoln at
Chicago.
CIRCULARS TO BE SENT TO TEE
SCHOOL CHILDREN.
Senators White, Congressman LouJ
and Ex-Mayor Pond Commend
the Good Work.
There was a large attendance of mem
bers of the Lincoln Monument National
League at the Occidental Hotel last night
to make arrangements for raising p. suit
able sum of money for a monument of
Lincoln in Golden Gate Park.
Entire unity of sentiment prevailed in
regard to the importance of the monu
ment, both !i9 commemorative of the life
and work of the martyred President and
as an incentive to tbe young to walk the
same paths. The object is to collect a fund
sufficient for the monument in sums of 25
cents from each person.
The following members of the Monument
League were present: Joseph Steele. W.
W. Stone, Elisha Brooks, S. Cohen, N. P.
Herne, C. Mason Kinne, H. C. Dibble,
Eugene Weigand, T. C. Masteller, F. J.
Peck, Peter H. Haas, Charles Edeiman, J.
H. Bautield, J. Murray Bailey. J. Kar
minsky, F. R. Handiey, C. W\ Gordon,
J. J. Lyons.
They composed the executive committee
of the leaei.e. These were met by Mayor
Fhelan and a committee from the Board
of Education, coiwsting of Barrington.
Walker, Head and Reagan, ana a general
conference was held. \V. \V. Stone, prin
cipal o! the Burnett Sctiool, waÂ« called to
tbe chair and acted as president of the
meeting.
It was decided that the members of the
school board shou'd have charge of the
collection of the 25-cent pieces from the
school children. It was provided that
every one who paid 25 cents should re
ceive a handsome certificate of member
snip in the league, with a vignette of Mr.
Lincoln.
Various opinions were given as to the
best way of reaching the public besides
through the avenue of the newspapers. It
was thought that a concise circular, tell
ing the ooject of the collection some
what in detail and in language suitable to
the understanding of the school chiidren,
should be piinted and circulated by school
superintendents and census marshals.
This was finally decided upon.
A number of leiters were read from
various city and county school superin
tendents approving the organization of
the Monument League and its obiect9.
Letters alike commendatory of the efforts
of the league were received from ex-
Mayor Pond, United States Senator
White, Congressman Loud; Samuel T.
Black, State Superintendent ot Pcblic
Instruction; General T. \V. Sheelian of
the Sacramento Recora-TJnion, and last
but not least from Robert T. Lincoln, ex-
Secretary of War, the oniy living eon of
Abraham Lincoln.
All these letters breathed a strong
spirit of patriotism. Robert T, Lincoln
expressed his grateful thanks for the good
work that had been begun.
Tuere is now no doubt about a large
sum of money being raised here for the
monument. It dees not Hj.peai that there
is an American in all California who will
not be glad to contribute 25 cents toward
the enlerDrise. Mr. Lincoln was, during
the years that the late of the Nation fiune
in a balance, almost revered by the pa
triotic people of this Stale, and his tragic
death hallowed this feeling.
Every one at the meeting last night was
in earnest heart and soul. The letter*
that were received gave the enthu iasm to
work hard and gain this object as early as
possible.

LINDELL HOUSE
IS CONDEMNED
Ordered Vacated by the
Board of Health
Yesterday.
Passing of a Famous Old
Political Cobnization
Hostelry.
Four Hundred and Fifty Little Rooms
That Excited the Physicians'
Disgust.
The old Lindell House, on the corner of
Sixth and Howard streets, famous during
ttie days of Boss Buckley's reign in locai
politics as one of the most notorious col
onization houses in the City, is duomtd.
The relentless hand of the Health Depart
ment has been laid on it and tbe edict has
gone forth that it must be thoroughly
renovated and placed in sanitary condi
tion, and if this is not possibleâ which is
thought to bt> the case â must be torn
down.
Though not of great size, the Lindell
House contains 4r>o little rooms, where the
helpless wanderer can obtain lodgings at
from 10 to 25 cei.ts per night.
In the palmy days of "push" politics,
when Buckley and other bosses numbered
The Old Lindell House, Famous in ths Days of Political Coloniza
tion, That Has Been Condemned by the Board of Health.
their henchmen by the thousands, the
Lindell House prospered. Just before an
election, and while registration was go
ing on, it fairly teeruei with hobos and
other colonists, who came from all parts
o! the country to share in the spoils of a
municipal election. Every room had one
or more occupants, who went back to
their occupations as "bay-bunkers" when
there was no farther use for their services.
Many a petty and sometimes serious
crime was committed in the Lindell in
those and previous day*, and the police
had frequent occasion to visit it. Of lnte
it has fallen into ilecav. Its accommoda
tions present few attractions except to
those who have been accintonie I to sleep
ing in empty packing-causes and doorways,
and when the health authorities visited it
recently more than half of the little rooms
were vacant.
Dr. Fitzgibbon of the committee on
nuisances reported at the meeting of the
Board of Health yesterday that he had
inspected it and found it in a "rotten,
dilapidated and unsanitary condition."
The bed mattresses were tound in a "filthy
condition, and the stench of some of the
rooms was unbearable." The doctor dis
covered that one roller towel was vouch
safed to eighteen persons, and that it was
uÂ«ed until it became thoroughly damp.
He recommended that the building be
condemned and the tenants ordered to
vacate.
The report was adopted and it was de
cided to order the house torn down unless
it is renovated in a manner satisfactory to
the depsrtment.
The Lindell House is owned by William
Wolf, who has conductad it for many
years past as a cheap transient lodging
house.
The New Children Society.
The second meeting of the Eureka Society
for the Protection of Children was held yester
day. Secretary Frank Hoibrook presented his
report from April 1, which showed fourteen
complaints reoeived, involving eighteen
Children. Kleven cases were investigated
and relief afforded to four children. Three
were placed in institutions. The society
elected twenty-two new members. The ser
vices of Robert Ash trere accepted as the at
torney for the society. The vresidcut. Mrs.
l'ettee, Mrs. Gurnett, Mrs. Rt-ay ana Mrs.
Koberti were selected as a committee on
membership.
NO EXPECTORATIONS.
Judge Campbell la Hi eta a Nominal
Penalty Upon Two Men-Capital
ist Bradbury Arrested.
W. B. Bradbury, the capitalist, for whose
arrest on a charge of expectorating in a
cable-car a warrant was issued Tuesday,
surrendered himself- yesterday morning.
His case was immediately called in Judge
Low's court, a id at his request a con
tinuance was granted for two days. He
was released on his own recoenizance.
Tht capitalist reasserts his intention of
teÂ«tiii>; the constitutionality of the
ordinance if he bo convicted, and the
probability is that he will demand a trial
by juiy.
Jtibu Smith, a brakeman, and C. Mc-
E.ruy, a nurse, were arrested on TllCftday
night on Fiilmore street by Policemen
Hyinan and Ilerintrfor txnectorating on
the sidewalk. They appeared before Judee
Campbell yesterday morning and pltaded
guilty.
Tlie Judue said the law was good and
salutary, und ho intende 1 to uphold it.
The expectorations o f men on the side
walks were swept up by ladies' dresses and
carried to their homes, thereby tending to
breed disease, and for that reason alone
tin* law should be enforced. Ha would
inflict a nominal penalty of $2fH)upon
each without an alternative, as it was the
first offense, but he would be more severe
in future case?.
IN3ANITY AND CRIME.
The Supreme Court Passes . Upon . the
Case or Ernest tielger.
A new trial of the case of Ernest Geiger,
charged with burglary in 1805. was denied
by the Supreme Court yesterday. When
the case was called for trial in the Superior
Court there was a stay of proceedings
asked for upon the ground that the de-
fendant was insane and had been legally
committed to an insane asylum. It seems
that lie wÂ»s committed to the Napa AÂ«v
lum on November 9, 1892, escaped on De
cember 24, 1894. and never returned. No
attempt was made to retake Geiger as the
resident physician nt tho asylum was of
the opinion that he had been restored to
reason. The resident physician had caused
to be chronicled in tho record book the
man's discharge as recovered soon alter
be escaped.
The Supreme Court held that tho man's
corporal presence was not necessary in
tho matter of his discharge. The defend
ant then wanted tie lower court to have
his sanity tested by a jury, but this was
denied, The trial proceeded and Geieer
was convicted. He ask d for a new trial
which was denied, and it was from this
order of denial that he appealed, but to
no purpose as shown.

MURPHY PROPERTY
Adam Grant Has Won
His Big Law
suit.
A Very Important D3cision
Rendered by the Su
preme Court
Tin Only Ressonib'e Msans of Dis
tributing the Property Amon;
the Cla m tats.
The building and lot occupied by the
firm of Miirpliy, Gram & Co. will have to
be sold and the proceeds di?triputed
among the contestant heirs. This con
firms the order of the lower court in the
suit brought by Adam Grant against Dan
iel T. Murphy, Mary Helen Dominguer
and other brothers and sisters, heirs of the
late Daniel T. Murphy and Anna L.
Murphy.
In that action the Supreme Court found
that the property in question is owned in
this proportion: Adam Grant, fourteen
| twenty-fourths; Mary H. Dominguez, one
twenty-fourth; Frances Josephine Mur
phy, one twenty-fourth; Mary Marguerite
Isabella Murphy, one twenty-fourth, and
the heir^ of the late Eugene K. L. Murphy,
one twenty-fourth. The remaining six
twenty-fourths was declared to belonc to
the estate of the late Anna 1,. Murphy,
widow of Grant's former partner, and that
it should go to her heirs. However, the
Supreme Court stated that it was not
wiibin the jurisdiction of that tribunal to
decide who were her heirs. Thnt matter,
| it contended, belongs to the probate de
! partment. where the case is still pending.
This was anything but satisfactory to
several of the parties involved und tue
case went to the Supreme Courr upon the
appeal of Mary M. Dominguez, Frances J.
Murphy and Mary I. Murphy. Tney
made the point in their appeal that the
decree of tho Superior Court did not de
termine, definitely or otherwise, who of
the *everal parties interested are actually
entitled to the interests of the late Anna
L. Murphy.
The Supreme Court in its decision
affirmed the decision of the lower court in
ordering the sale of the property, holding
that it is the only fair and equitable
means of giving to the claimants and con
testants their just deserts. The decision
is a victory ior Adam Grant. In summing
up the case the Supreme Court says:
It would M.-0111 just to allow the sale to be
made, leaving that part of the proceeds which
go to the sucoesors In interest of Anna L.
Murphy, deceased, to awfiit the determination
of said contest in the Probste Court â  â¢ â¢
And where, aÂ» in the case at bar, the court
has determined all matters over which it has
jurisdiction and has definitely ascertained all
the interests of all the contestants, except
oniy tho issues between contesting claimants
in tne Probate Court of the interest of a de
ceased cu-ienant, over which issues it has no
jurisdiction, and the premises must be sold in
order to effect a just decisionâ there is a de

TAKING ICE
TO ALASKA
The Topeka lo Be Fitted
With Refrigerators for
Juneau.
She Makes Monthly Trips Be
tween Alaskan Ice-Fields
and Puget Sound.
Raw Sugar Is P.entiful and Vessels
Cannot Get Berths at tha
R finery.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Umatilla got in yesterday after an un
eventiul trip from Puget Sound. After
landing her passengers at Broadway
wharf Captain Hunter took her to Beale
street to discharge her cargo of coal. It
was one of the prettiest landings ever
ninde on the water front. The steamer
had to dock ahead of a ship that was
moored at the outer end, and in conse
quence there was not more than 200 feet
give and take in which the Umatilla could
maneuver. A Whitehall was in attend
ance ready to tak- the linee. but her ser
vices were not required. With masterly
sfcill Captain Hunier put his vessel along
side, and inside of ten minutes she was
moored and the coal in the holds was be
ing discharged into the bunkers.
The UmatiKa brines the news that the
Alaska steamer City of Topefea is to be
htted with refrigerating machinery.
When old timers in the Alaskan trade
heard of the innovation they laughed, and
one remarked to the other "carrying coal
to Newcastle." On the first Dlush it does
look that way. The Topeka runs up into
the regions of everlasting snow and ice,
and it is to see the glaciers, icebergs and
the ice-clad mountains that excursionists
visit the far north. With ice on all sides
of her it doe 3 seem strange that a steamer
bouna north should be luted out with re
frigerating machinery.
The explanation la a simple one, how
ever. Large quantities of fresh meat, but
ter, eggs and vegetables are sent every
month to Sitka and Juneau on the City of
Topeka. It all goes from Seattle and Ta
coma, and during the summer months it
is very Â»iard to keep the goods in condi
tion. Ice is plentilul in Alaska, but it is
not plentiful in I'ueet Sound during the
summer. Consequently the steamship
company has come to the conclusion to
put in ice machinery and thus keep all
perishable coods fresh during the trip. A
strange part of the whole matter is the
s;atement that it is cheaper to mate ice
on board the steamer than it is to break it
from an ice-Hoe with axes ana load it into
the vessel's icechest. Such is the fact,
however, and Chief Engineer Lace of the
Dmaiilla will remain over at Port Town
send to superintend the erection of the
machinery. He will be gone only a few
days, and in the meantime F;rst Assistant
J. W-jlters will look after the Umatilla.
The barkentine S. C. Allen, whic'i ar
rived from Honolulu on March 2(5 last
vrith a load of sugar, has none to Mission
Rock to lie up. So miny sugar boats
have pot in of late that the refinery can
not bundle all tne cargoes offering. In
consequence the Allen will tie up along
side the rock until she secures a turn at
the sugar refinery wharf.
The brig W. G. Irwin and the schooner
H. C. Wri.ht also arrived from Hawaii
yesterday with sugar, but, as they have to
take t heir turn after the Allen, it will D 6
some time before they will have a chance
to discharge.
The so ouner R. W. Bartlett goes to the
Union Iron WorKs to-day to take on board
the iron tanks and boilers for thesteamers
now being put together in the Amoor
River. The steamers are stern-wheelers,
and are lo operate in connection with
the Trans-Siberian Railroad. The vessels
were built here and were sent north in
sections. These boilers aie the last con
signment, antt once they are in place and
tested the stern-wheelers will be put in
commission.
The tug Vigilant picked up a direlect
Whitehall ye-terday. Captain John Silo
vich says it was bottom up. but that the
sail was still set and that the oars were
lashed to the seats. As none of the boat
men are missing the chances are that it is
a boat whose sail had been set out to dry
and which during a squall broke away
from her moorings.
Tne new company that is building gaso
line echooners for the near-by coasting
trade is not letting the gras3 grow under
its feet. The Fort Ross trade is already
pre-empted and the schooner Mary C
went out under the new flag yesterday.
She will run regularly until the Call
(named after the owner of Port lloss) is
ready for the route.
The ship Crown of Denmark was towed
into port by the tug Sea Queen yester
day. Tnis is her third consecutive voyage
here and on each occasion Captain lite
Smith, the popular and efficient master
of the Sea Queen, has towed her into port.
Later in tue day tne tugs Vigilant and
Active took hold of the Crown of Denmark
and . docked her in the mud alongside the
Sausallto ferry, where she will discharge
her cargo of Newcastle (N. 8. W.) coal.
The Crown of Denmark took eighty-four
days to mate the run from Australia to
San Francisco.
Many months ago the Uniled States
revenue cutter Hartley lost her propeller
while making a landing at one of the
wharves. Later one of the State's dredg
ers picked it up in one of the buckets and
the men demanded salvage. This Uncle
Sam refused to pay, and a war of words
followed. A suit in the United States
courts was about to be tiled when the men
on the dredger reconsidered the situation
and yesterday they gave up possession of
the propeller.

century's service.
Ever since the death of his son, about a

tbe burdens of office irksome and he made
no secret of his intention to retire when
ever the opportunity presented itself.

tire, paved the way for him, and he only i
waited for the settlement of a business
proposition for the consummation of that
which be so devoutly wished.
The Commissioners were reluctant to
part with him, as they, by their iong as
sociation with him, knew of his sterling
wort a and realized how difficult it would
be to select one to fill so fully the require
ments of the office, but he was deaf to
their persuasions, as he was backed up in
bis resolution by the entreaties of nis
family.
Last night after the Police Commission
ers bad disposed of several cases they
formed themselves into a pension board
and the following letter was placed before
them:
To the Honorable Board of Police. Pension Fund
Commisxionet Â« of the (.ity and County of San

After about half an hour Sergeant Mof

ask Captain Lees to appear before the
board. Tue captain remained in the
boardroom for some minutes and retired.
Then the Commissioners quietly slipped
away and Captain Healy came out and
announced that Chief Crowley nad retired,
that Captain LeeÂ« had been appointed to
fill the unexpired term, which ends on
December 1, and that Detective Ben

department for so many years completely
prostrated him and friends could only
show tneir sympathy by a warm pressure
of the baDd. He did not remain long, but
went borne accompanied by one of his
daughters.
Poiice Commissioner Tobin stated nfter
the meeting last evening that Chief Crow
ley's resignation was handed in in accord
ance with ths plan that was outlined S( v
eral months ago when the Chief's health
showed signs of failing.
"Captain Lees, his successor," he said,
"was elected for the unexpired term of the
Chief's office, which runs about ten
months longer. Whether he will be re
elected at that time is beyond my power
to say."
Detective Bohen, who has been raised
to the rank of Chief of Detectives, holds
office indefinitely, at the pleasure of the
Board of Police Commissioners, there be

THE EX-CHIEF'S RECORD.
Something About the Head or the
Department, Who Has Grown
Cray In the Service.
Chief Crowley was born in Albany, N.
V., on March 17, 1831, and two years later
his father removed to New York, after
his mother's death. When a boy he was
employed in a printer's shop, and when
19 he came to this City on the steamer
Carolina on May 6, 1850. He went to the
mines for a year or two and returned to
the City and engaged in the boating, busi

ness for a short time. In 1852 he tried his
luck at mining again, but returned the
following year am* again started in the
boating business.
In 18r>4 ho was elected to the office of
Town Constable, which he held by elec
tion until 18H6, when he was elected Chief
of Police. He was elected to the position
until 1873, when he retired and went into
the stockbrokerage I usinesÂ». . By an act
of the l^etfislature in 1878 the Board of Po
lice Commissioners received the nower to
appoint the Chief of Police, and he was
prerailed upon to accept the office. He
lias held it ever since, being appointed
every two years, his last appointment
being December 1, 18H5.
The Cnief proved iiiinself on many oc
casions a brave an J fearles-* man, and one
who by his personal magnetism inspired
others to deeds of bravery. The first mat
ter ot any importance that he handled as
Cnief was the tjueiling of the Potrero riots
ajtamst thb Chinese in 1806. Then fol
lowed the exposure and breaking up of
the powerful whisky ring. In 1870, oy his
present eof mind and bravery, lie quelled
a riot and saved Quinn, tbe murderer of
Maggie Ryan, from being lynched. But
the greatest mob that he ever handled
Muccessiully was tbe one that attempted
to take Aleck Goldenson, the slayer of
Mamie Kelly, while on his way to the jail
on Broadway.
THE NEW CHIEF.
Isaiah W. Lees, at Whose Name
the Most Hardened Crim
inal Quails.
Chief I. W. Lees is one of the oldest, if
not the oldest police officer in the United
States, and possibly in the world. There
is no officer or deieotire on the globs who
is better known, and he is regarded by all
in his line as an authority on criminal
matters. Forty-two years ago Lses was a
plain patrolman in this City.
In several encounters he was severely
wounded, and to-day he carries as many
bwllet and knife wound scars as he tias
lingers and thumbs. His early work was
on the Barbary Coast, then the toughest
place in the West. Among the young
officer's early exploits was in 185fi, when
he achieved prominence in arresting
James I*. Casev. the siayer of James Kine
of Willinra, editor of the .Bulletin, and
getting the man-killer away from the mob.
Chiei Lees was born in England in 1829
and came 10 the United Stales when a
baby In his mother's arms. Tde family
sett.cd in New Jersey. His father died
when Lees Â«ab a very small child and the
youngster was thrown upon his own re
sources. At a very early age he worked
in a ropew:dk and later peddled tinware
in New Jersey. When only 20 years
of age Lees came to ban Fran
cisco with his friend John Nightin
gale and on hi-j way traveled in
Mexico. He came to San Francisco in
1849 and later worked in tlie mines at
Horseshoe Bar on the American River.
Toil did not suit his taste, for he came
back to San Francisco and followed his
trade of machinist, learned before leaving
the East. In 1553, througn the influence
of his friend Nightingale, he got on the
police force and three years later he was
promoted to detective.
The New Chief of Detectives.
Ben Boiien, the new captain oi detec
tives, was born in 1833. He joined the
department on September 19, 1861, *nd
although he did detective duty for several
years it was not till December, 1878, that
he was officially appointed to that posi
tion. He always had the entire confidence
of Chief Crowley and Captain Lee?*, who
looked upon him as an able, painstaking
and efficient officer.

JOOST MAY HAVE
MADE A STRIKE
He Finds Native Mercury
on His Twin Peaks
Property.
â¢
The Discovery Made While a
Lot Was Being Exca
vated.
Preparations Under Way for Devel
oping and Testing the Mine
Imm diately.
Ben rend Joost, the street railway build
er, says he has discovered p quicksilver
mine in the vicinity of Twin Peaks which,
if it developes as he thinks it will, is cer
tain to prove of immense value.
Mr. Joost called at the Sriate Mining
Bureau yesterday and exhibited a bottle
of the product of his mine and Assistant
Secretary Durdan, who examined the con
tents of the vial carefully, pronounced it
native mercury.
He declared that if it could be found in
sufficient quantities Mr. Joost had a for
tune in store for him.
The discovery of the mine was wnolly
accidental. Mr. Joost owns considerable
property in the vicinity of Twin Peaks
and in the neighborhood of the western
most *md of the Market-street cut.
At the latter place ne ha? bad some
men at work for several days excavating
a lot. One of the;*e men noticed, so Mr.
Joost says, that wherever the ground was
broken little globules of a silvery liquid
formed and rolled about playfully. He
did not know what thin subbtance was,
but reported tht matter to Mr. Joost. It
did not lake the latter long to recognize
tl)f stuff as mercury.
Queer enough, there are no indications
of any cinabar, from which quicksilver is
usually extracted, about the piace. The
rock lormaiion in the lot â or mine, as
Mr. Joost hopes to call it â is a species of
quartz, or serpentine rock.
In order to secure the native mercury
wnen it is found in this State the process
is to crusii the rock, thus liberating a great
deal of the valuable proauct, and then
con-ign the pulp to a retort for tne bal
ance.
Mr. Joost Â»ays he intends to have a thor
ough investigation made in order to ascer
tain just what hi- discovery amounts to.

THE LAST JUMP
Thorpe Took the Stake
Event With Morello's
Daughter.
A Fair-Si'z'd Crowd at Emery
ville Picked Only a Few
Winners.
Pat Dunne Bought To/are Out of a |
Silling Raceâ Mobalasca Downed
Pat Murphy in a Drive.
Recreation, a daughter of the dead
Morello, captured the stake event for
two-year-olds at Emeryville yesterday by
the narrowest of margins from Michael.
"With winning penalties accrued she car
ried 120 pounds and coupled in the bet
ting with Miss Rowena, the pair were 3 to
5 favorites. The latter filly was sent out
to make the running, and led Gypceiver,
the Morris entry, to the paddock. Here
"Ekeets" Martin on Michael urged his
mount to the front, and Thorpe, astride
Recreation, perceiving that it was all off
with the statue's other representative, be
gan riding his' mount hard. Michael
hung on in bulldog fashion, and was
only nosed out the last jump in the fast
time of 55 seconds. When looking to
have a royal chance, GypcÂ«iver was inter
fered with by Michael a furlong from
home, but Willie Martin's claim of foul
was disallowed.
At yesterday'i drawing but fourteen
bookmakers weighed in, and these bandied
all of the money bet very comfortably.
The atiendance was fair, but the card
looked li&e tough timber and no great
amount of plunging was indulged in by
spectators. Favorites had decidedly an
off day, winning but two races.
. After Mobalasca, owned by Ed Corrigan,
had downed the 0 :o 10 favorite, Pat Mur
phy, sporiing the red, white and blue
Sprecke.s colors, a large crowd gathered
around the judges' stand in expectation
of seeing some sport in the way of a
"boost, '' a? the race was decided under
selling conditions. They were doomed to
disappointment, 'or when the mare, which
was entered ior $400, was put up to be sold
the expected raise was not forthcoming.
Later in the day the last event decided,
over seven furiones, Tulare, owned by A.
B. SpreckeJs, a 30 to 1 shot in the bet
ting, succeeded in beating both the 7 to 10
iavonte, Osric 11, and the 7 to 5 second
choice, Suisun. \Vhen DUt up to be sold,
entered for $400, the geldine was bid up to
|800 by Pat Dunne, and changed owners,
the stable evidently being satisfied to let
iiim go. It was undoubtedly a scratch vic
tory, as the two choice* raced their heads
off, and were both groggy at the saddling
paddock. Slaughter then came on from
third place with the outsider ana beat
Suisun a head.
The opening six furlong selling scramble
went to Dr. McAllister, a 7 to 1 chance,

MISS YING'S
GIGGLING LIES
She Told One Story in
Court and Another
Elsewhere.
And Confessed That She Had
Lied to Suit Her Coo*
venience.
Romance of a Chinese Maiden Engaged
in Doing Up American
Officials.
Miss Jeng Xgan Ying had the audacity
to smile at Judge Heacock yesterday
when she took the witness chair to swear
herself into this country as a native
daughter of the Golaen West. She not
only smiled, but she giggled and put her
handkerchief up to her face to veil it, and
then she exchanged a knowing look with
three highbinders sitting in the United
States Court Commissioner's chambers.
Her glance seemed to say i.i plain Eng
lish: "Watch me repeat my lesson. I
know it by heart."
When taken to the Presbyterian Chinese
Mission out of a disreputable house she
told one story as to her history. Before
Commissioner Heacock yesterday Her tale
was of a different and contradictory plot.
She was a native oi America and an Amer
ican citizeness and nobody could deny
it, because her mother was dead and her
father and sister were in Mexico, which
was nearly as bad. They were outside the
jurisdiction of the court anyhow.
When confronted with tne contradictory
statement she had made in the l'resby
terian Mission she frankly confessed that
she had iied on that occasion. 'United
States District Attorney Foote did not
ask her whether she was perjuring herself
on this occasion. Had be done so she
would have answered "no," but the man
ner of fter answer would have been beau
tiful to behold.
Yet Yong was one of the witnesses
called by United States District Attorney
Foote to testify that a Chinese interpreter
had directed one of the arrested girls.
Yuan Yuh Toy, to say when she should
be examined by the court that she was
not a native of China, but had been born
in San Fruncisco's Chinatown.
Lyman Mowry objected to the testimony
of ibis girt, because although the reported
conversation might bave taken place in
the presence and bearing of the defendant,
she was not bound by it, because the
question had not baen addressed 10 her or
answered by her.
Judge Heacock thought he was right
and so decided, whereupon the Chinese
woman in American clothes retired among
her Mongolian countrymen.
Miss Jcng JJga:i Ying, the prisoner,
after giggling at the Judge, told her care
fully rehearsed story. Between each ques
tion she shot out of her dark almond eyes
a triumphant challenge at the three high
binders sitting near Miss Culbertson.
It appeared that early in the day her at
torney applied to Judge Jdorrow for per
mission to interview the women and the
itio other defendants with the aid of an
interpreter â a Chinaman. The District
Attorney insisted that the official inter
preter should be prase nt also in order to
That "Prices talk." and in a most convincing manner, is a fact which is
daily demonstrated by the thousands who take advantage of our Matchless
offerings of New Spring Goods, and this fact will be still further empha-
sized by this week's special attractions, for the styles are the latest and
most exclusive, the qualities the most reliable, and the prices so amazingly

coaching the woman as to ihe statement
she should make in court. As the pris
oner had a tight to the services of counsel
and an interpreter, and had a right to
confer with her attorney privately. Judge
Morrow decided that the District Attor
ney's interpreter, Mr. Jones, would be a
persona non grata ana an eavesdropper,
and that therefore he would have a right to
exclude him from the interview. He was
excluded, the interview was had, and ibe
lady came simpering into court without a
bitch in her story.
She was born at such and such a num
ber on Washington street, San Francisco,
but not in Little Pete's house. Jeng Ah
Ying was her father. Her mother, Mrs.
Ying. died in ISSI. In 1382 Miss Ying
went to China with her sister, named
Yok Ying, on t.'ie Oceanic. They came
back on August 29 on the Kio de Janeiro,
and her sister, who was married, went to
Mexico with her husband. Her father
went there, too. When she was arrested
she was weeping ovnr the death of her
adopted mother in the house in which the
dend body lay.
When Mr. Foote a;ked her whether Bhe
had not triven a different name at the
time of her arrest she replied that&he
hart, because the arrest frightened her
and she did not wish to give her true
name. Whcu at the mission she said
her father's name was Leong Keow.
"Ye*; I said it was Leong Kow," she
replied; "bat I didn't tell Hie trutn then."
"Didn't you say that your father died
when you were five years old, and th&t
your mother was dead before that?"
"Yes," was the answer, "but I didn't
tell the truth then."
Here she giggled behind her handker
chief at the interpreter. Then she went
on after a joyful glance at the highbind
ers.
"I said at that time that I was an In
mate of a disreputable house because I
wanted to get out quick."
The case writ over until to-day.

Permanent Organization of the
Committee of the Chamber
of Commerce.
A Smaller Committee Will Devote Its
Entire Time to the P. an on a
Business Basis.
The committee of the Chamber of Com
merce appointed to act wilh Major Win
chell of the social wing of the Salvation
Army to further the colonization tcneuie
which was agitated by Commander Booth-
Tucker during his recent visit met yester
day.
The committee acted upon the major's
suggestion to form a permanent organiza
tion of the commutes and to begin the
work with an idea of its future great ex
pansion; tbat a committee of three be
I appointed to give their enuie time to the
work and to set the pians before the
business men as a first-clnss business
proposition and one not to be lost sight of
â  immediately upon the letting up of the mi
i tense pressure of the poor which is now
being felt by the community.
H. H. Sherwood was elected permanent
chairman, in response to these sugges
tion?, and Georce H. Maxwell secretary
and Daniel Meyer treasurer.
The permanent committee of three will
be appointed from the members of the
general committee. They will endeavor
' to interest not only members of the Cham
ber oi Commerce, but all other organized
! bodies, such as the Board of Trade, the
I Agricultural Association and the cuurches
!of all denominations. A mass-meeting
will be called for this purpose.
Major Wincheil goes to Santa Rosa in a
' day or so to hold a meeting t i-rc and get
expressions from the Santa Rosans as to
their attitude toward the colony. The i
thing of chief moment with them is that
j they snail effect an exchange of products
with the colonizers.
The major will shortly begin : he publi
cation of a monthly devoted to the colon
! izing scheme. It will be named "The Cal
i ifornia Colonization Call. :> He reports
| the woo : camp near Santa Ko-a as work
| ing Tery successfully, and that the men
I are earning on an averaeo of $1 30 per day.

NEW YORK, N. V., April 7.-The dealings at
the Stock Exchange to-day were characterized by
extreme dullness, and as a rule the fluctuations
were confined within narrow limits. The resolu
tion introduced into the Pennsylvania Legislature
to investigate the affairs of the Lehlgb Valley and
Wilkesbarre Coal Company led to an attack upon
Jersey Central at the opening, and the stock de
clined about a point, to 76 / - Purchases to cover
Rbort contracts promptly lei to an advance to
77%. At the same time i-ugar developed marked
strength, and on unusually large purchases cd
vanced steadily irom lIOV* to 112%- Finns with
Wash, URton connections were the principal buy
ers, and this led to rumors that legislation would
be favorable to the sugar relincry interests after
all.
â  subsequently the advance was partially lost.
.Leather ruled weak on revival of reports that the
company interred to shut down it:, tanner.es for
ft short time. Near the cos- renewed purchase of
sugar led to a rally in the general liÂ»i. Amonc

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 11.1-, April 7. â Wheat prices
dropped rapidly this morning, the opening being
from 84 to lc under Monday's close, and a further
recession of >2 C was due to Bradstreet's report of
an increase of the visible supply of 2,500.000
bushels. Liverpool cables were a penny lower at
the start, but that, loss was also unquestionably a
result of the report mentioned Receipts at Chi
cago were 22 cars, an I 113,000 bushels were
withdrawn from store. The Northwest received
263 cars, against 391 las. Wednesday and 314 a

THE MARINE ENGINEER.
An Officer With Vast BeapontibilitleÃ
Who Seldom Gets Much Credit.
From the time, less than sixty years
ago, when the first steam vessel crossed
the Atlantic, the evolution of the marine
engineer has been rapid, but he is
the one class of marine craftsman
that, above all others, has kept pace
with the developments of this fast
speeding ace, and he stands to-day the
most finished product of a cefitury that has
created more new types and more new
occupations than any tnat has preceded
it. The marine engineer to-day 1* more
important than any deck officer, but his
importance is as little recognized by the
non-seafarinp man as his identity is con
cealed from the view of those who travel
in ships. Down in tne bowels of the ves
sel, he controls not only the oropulsion,
but the steerinsr, ligbtinc, pump
ing, anchoring and ventilation of the
modern marine structure, and on the war
ship he is even responsible for the ma
nipulation ot heavy guns. The eyes that
steer the ship are those of the officer of
the watch, but the brain that guides the
ship 10 her destination and regulates her
internal economy is the brain of the ma
rine engineer. HiÂ» is the real responsi
bility, and, we are afraid, his is the least
share of tbe honor that is given to those
who serve their country or their employ
ers with courage and devotion on the sea.
All the world heard of the gallantry of
Captain Kane or the Calliope, in working
his ship out of the Samoan anchorage in
the teeth of a cyclone; who heard of the
struegle of the engineer officers with the
machinery down below, and how many
know even tne names ot them ? â Pall Mail
Gazette.
A young man at Munchberg, Germany,
tried to escape military service by disguis
ing himself "' a fenr-le conk.

FOR CAUSING PAIN
Hans Olsen Asked That His
Amputated Limb Be
Eased.
Three Instances Where Patients
Have Made the Same
Request
Doctors Assert That the R asm Is
Easily Exp ained by a Litt c
Exercise of Philosophy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 7- )
The story of John Quaiter9 that was
published in this morning's Call received
astram-e verification this morning. Q ia'
ters, after the amputation of his loot, de
clared that the dismembered limb was
troubiine him much on account of its be
ing cramped, as though it was still at
tached to him. Steward Tobin of the
Receiving Hospital says that ths experi-
Scene in Judge Hall's Courtroom Showing the Great Interest Taken in the Trial of the Contest
Brought by Ex-Mayor Davie to Oust Mayor Thomas.
ence of Qnalters is very remarkable,
though not uncommon.
At an early hour tbis morning a man
named Hans Oisen was brought to the
hospital suffering from a crushed arm.
He had been struck by a freight train
somewhere near Berkeley, and wrien
brought to the hospital was suffering
acutely. An examination of his injury
convinced the doctors that it would be
necessary to amputate the arm near the
shoulder. The operation was performed
and Olsen was put to bed in the ward.
A few minutes later the doctor was fold
ing the arm at the elbow to wrap up and
take away with him. At the same time
Steward Tobin heard Olsen screaming in
his cot. He went at once to the sufferer,
who said thai be could feel his missing
Â«rra being doubled up, and he requested
that it be at onre straightened out into a
comfortable position. Both the steward
and the doctor convinced Oisen that his
limb woulil be buried in a position of
comfort and tha sufferer at once said that
the pain that he Lad felt had left him.
A few months ago Mrs. Gatters, wife of
a well-known barber, experienced the
Bame Annoyance from a dismembered
limb. Mrs. Gatters was out hunting and
in drawing her gun after her tnrougb a
ience the weapon accidentally exploded
and the charge shattered her leg. ft was
necessary to perform amputation and the
member was duly buried.
Mr?. Gutters soon after complained of
suffering great discomfort and pain from
her missing limb, and she was not re
lieved until the leg was disinterred and
plated in another position, since which
tim- it ims eased to troublce her.
Dr. 0. 0. Hnmlin, one of the leading
surgeons o! this city, said to-day that such
instances are not uncommon in -urgical
practice.
â 'It is not at all unreasonable," iad he,
â¢'for any one to have such an experience
when we apply a little common-sensa to
the existing condition*. A patient who
Buffers amputation has been accustomed
to the use of th* iimb all his life. Hi*
mind is accustomed to think of his body
as a whole, and when one member is
taken away it ii very easy to conceive that
it will be a iong while be.ore a man'? mind
can fully realize tbat it has Jo-t control
absolutely o( one portion of his body. At
such times there is always, of course,
acute pain on account of the amputation,
and the mind will naturally revert to that
portion of the body.
"Not being accustomed to attribute pain
to a condition of affairs with which his
mind is entirely unfamiliar, he naturally
attributes it to the condition of affairs
to which it is accustomed. In the case of
Qnalters, hiÂ« limb would naturally leel
peculiar to him. It would be painful,
and it would be but natural for him to
imagine that the Kmb was causing it.
When convinced that the limb s in a po
sition of comjort then his mind is at reat.
Ido not fee how any other intelligent
explanation can be made."
Dr. O. L. Jones, who has given consider
able attention to such matters and who
has traveled exiensivt-ly among the un
civilized tribes of Africa, says that such
conditions s ould can<e no surprise. ''In
South nnd Central Africa," he sayg, "Â»uch
ideas are frequently found, because the
medicine man realize; to a great extent
the effect o: mind over matter.

to the extent that the faith they place on

like tho-e of Qualters and Olsen it is sim

his mind to discover some reason for it.
Very naturally, not realizing in a hurry

lives, he lays all the blame on the missing
member."
A DESULTORY RECOUNT.
So One Taken Any Int*re<it in the
Dnvie-Tiiomas Contest*
OAKLAND, Cal., April 7.â The great
contest over the Mayoralty is a dire fail
ure. Not only does it fjÂ«il to decrease
M.-iyor Thomas' majority, but it fails to
interest the public, and Judge Hall's
court is deserted, except for the teller
and caller.
None of the alleged frauds are devolop
ing and the recount shows that tbe .'fncers
of election were not the venal people that
they were said to be. Instead, the ballotÃ
show that the official count was a very
ordinary one and that the officers made
tbe usual number of mistakes and no
more, and the di?crepnncies appear to
have been made as much in favor of one
candidate as anotber.
One precinct invalope was found on
which the seal was broken, an i after an
argument Jud^e Hail admitted It and or
dered it to be counted. There are about
forty ballots held in reserve, and these
will" be held by the court until the recount
is completed. From present indications
it looks as though Mayor Thomas' major-
ity may be decreased by about 10, unless
some unlooked-for event happens.
WEDDED IN A HURRY.
Boys and ' Girls Croat the Bay and
Return a* Husbands and
Wives.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 7.â Frank Holt
and Miss Mamie Lund came from San
Francisco to be married. They were ac
companied by Herman Brockman and
Miss Katie O'Brien. As they walked up
and down Broadway, evidently rather
reticent about going to the Clerk's office,
they attracted considerable attention as
they paraded two by two.
After a while they asked the way to
the County i lerk's office, and the four
children, for they looked like school boys
and girls out for a picnic, were directed to
the county buildings. Holt asked Deputy
Cal Ewlng for a license, and no sooner
bad he spoken than Brockman very ab
ruptly said, "Me. too." This declaration
on the part of the letter was evidently a
surprise to everybody present except Miss
Katie O'Brien. A. little inquiry developed
the fact that while parading Broadway
Herman and Katie had made up their
minds to follow the example of Jfranic
and Mamie.
Everything being legal, and the young
men urearing tbat the young ladies in
short dresses were 18 years of age, the
licenses were granted, and a few minutes
later, amid giggling and joking, the quar
tet appeared before Judge Clift and were
duly joined in holy wedlock.
Judge Clift would not have been sur
prised if the young ladies had told him
ih.it they were but 14, for they certainly
looked nearer '.hat than 18. The young
men gave their ages as 21 and 24, and no
body would have taken them lor being
any older. After the ceremony the quar
tet took the lirst train back to San rran
citco.
New Boulevard Planned.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 7.â The Board
of Trade is considering a new route across
the i ills in Contra Costa County. Ivor
many years ail kinds of projects have
been entertained, but now Mr. Sjhst, a
director o! the Exchange, has come to
the cone usion tnat a road sboud be
built whicn will be such a desirable boule
vard that instead of Oaklanders running
to San Francisco to enjoy the r;de at
Golden Gate Park they will come over
here and take advantage of the new boule
vard. Ti.e proposed road has already
been surveyed and staked, and it is
claimed it can be built for $50u0.

OAKLAND, Cal., April 7.â George W.
Silver, who is now in the San Francisco
jail, is the tame Bilver that has been no
lorio-.is on this siue of the bay for many
years. Some timÂ« ago he was convicted
of forgery by Attorney Tappan of Ala
meda and sent across the bay. He was
pÂ»rdoned on the understanding that he
Irave the State. He suffers from crippled
iirubs and ia well known by court habi

character that he should have tried to

TWO STORIES OF
A BEATEN MAN
Manager Frost Tells How
He Was Most Brutally
Maltreated.
Detectives Unravel Another
Tale of an Anonymous
Letter and a Girl.
Both Men Were Assailed at thÂ« Same
Place, but Apparently for
Different Radons.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 7. f
The police and detective force are strug
gling with a genuine mystery. Although
satisfied that they have solved it the tes
timony of some of the principals li 10
greatly at variance as to leave some ap
parent but no real doubt.
Myron Frost, manager of the Oakland
Lumber Company, is confined to his bed
with fearful injuries to his head, having
been seriously beaten last Friday night
in a very pecular raannei. His face and
eyes when seen to-night were black, blue
and yellow from bruises, and it will be
several days before he is able to get up.
He received the beating outside the Ebell
clubhouse and that structure still bear-i
the stains from the cuts that were made
on his head when he was being knocked
against it by his assailants.
Detective Williems has made a very
complete investigation and has discovered
the following facts: Several days ago a
young woman, said to be Miss May Gilli
gan, received an anonjmous letter, asking
her to meet the writer at the corner of
Alice and Fifth streets. Sue was a little
suspicious, but confided the affair to a
young man with whom she was keeping
company, lie advised her to keep the
appointment and promised to keep watch
with some friends and see that no barm
befell her. On Friday night she was at
the appointed place on time and found a
gentleman there.
Her newly made friend proposed a walk
up to the Kbell building lot at Thirteenth
and Harrison streets, which is owned by
the proprietor of the lumber-mill where
Mr. Frost is manager. On reaching the
building the man proposed that they pas*
vhrouah a dark pnssape back of the bund
ing. The girl demurred, and her com
panion was about to use lorce when three
young men came into view, and wheu the
man struck one of them it was a signal
for a general melre. The girl fled, and
after teating her companion the three
fellows took to their heels.
The same night Mr. Frost was tear
fully beaten in the rear of tbe Ebell build
ing, but he denies ever seeing a girl there,
or knowing anything about one.
Mr. Frost lives in a comfortable home
with his wife. When seen to-night he
said :
"I am ratisSed that my assailants were
old-time enemies. I <ou'.d give two or
tbre? co uinns of their history and then
no one would be any wiser. 1 have an
impression of them in my nun :, but none
that I could swear to. 1 don't want to
p>ace them on. their guard by teliing them
what I i ropose to do. That would not
do. They are the name .-et that assaulted
Mr. Reed four or five years ago. I knew
they wer* alter me. They did not mis
take me for some on* else. I was simply
doing a little job for Mr. Reed, measuring
a window of his building for a screen."
"If Frost's story be true." said Detective
Williams, "ihere must have been two men
b-nten at the back of the Â£bell building.
Hi has toid me that be was beaten by ruf
tians whom he would not recocnize and
consequently that he cannot swear to war
rants against them. Ue fir.it said ha aid
not see any one, ana later confessed that
he saw three men. The blows came from
the front rather than the back. He de
nied thai he made any outcry or defended
himself, as it was nil so Â»v tcten. His hat,
found on lhe scene of action, torn in two,
shows how fierce the battle was. I am
perfectly sati.-n-d that he has not told me
all he knows. People in (he neighborhood
heard a cry, bui as it was not repeated
they paid no further attention to it. We
know all of the three nssai.an:Â«, and if
Frost will not swear to the complaints we
shall put Ins story down as lacking cre
dence."
Miss Gilligan adds to the mystery. She
says she knows nothing about the r.ffair.
"Why do you come to me ? I have only
heard of it. I told Mr. Williams all I
knew. I was at work both afternoon and
evening of that day. I did not receive a
leter to meet any one. and did not meet
any one by appointment.''

OAKLAND, Cal., April 7.â Fred Chel

the works, and c was unpaged this even
ing in drawing off petroleum from the
tank on a car into the tanks at the works.
There was a leak in the pipe and Chelson
took a lamp to locate it.
He found it sooner than he expected'
and the escaping gas was ignited by the
lamp. There waÂ» an explosion, and for a
brief space Chelson. car arid pipe were en
veloped in flume*. As the man-hole was
off the tank the flames were not confined,
but could escape, and so very little dam
age was done.
Chelson was brought to the receiving
hospital and his hands, face and breast
were foui.d to be severely burned. He
was able to go home after his wounds
were dressed.
FIREMEN MUCH EXCITED.
A New Lair Making the Office of Chief
Elective in Fifth-Class
Cities.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 7.â The volun
teer members of the Fire Department of
this city are much wrought up this after
noon over the publication of a bill ap
proved March 27, 1897, which provides
that in cities of the fifth class, which is
Alameaa's rank, the Chief of the Fire De
partment shall be elected by the mem
bers, subject to confirmation by the Board
of Trustees of the city. The joke lies in
the fact that few or none knew that such
a measure was before the last Legislature,
much less that it was enacted and ap
proved. In Alamsda the Chief was al
ways elected until about a year ago, when
to place greater responsibilities on his
shoulders the office was made appointive,
and Chief F. K. Krauth Jr. was named to
succeed himself. This was while a con
test was pending between him and Max
Oundlach as to the result of the last pre
viously held election in February, 1896,
when it was said that for that election
company rolls were swelled with men
who never seriously intended to do fire
duty, but were brought in to vote.
Chief Krauth, who knew of the exist
ence of some measure affecting fire de
partments of cities of Aianit>d*i's class,
though having no knowledge of its pro
visions, is inclined to believe from a read
ing oi the bill that it does away altogether
with the paid members of the depart
ment, iv that it refers only to volunteer
companies and makes provision for the
paid services of no one save the Cuief.
lie argues that it is faulty in various re
spects, not the least of which is the one
that no tenure is prescribed for the Chief.
Chief Krauth says the effect of the bill
wilt bo in Alameda to relegate its depart
ment to that of a rural community. City
Attorney Taylor, who is tree to confess
that be had no knowledge of the bill, does
not think that its effect will be to dis
pense with paid firemen, for they are pro
vided for under a general clause of the
city charter. Both officials are wondering,
however, just whera the joker in the bill
comes in and what was the motive for its
enactment.
Uniformity in Vacations.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 7.â Directors
Tisdale ana Knowles of the Board of Edu
cation and Superintendent Sullivan have
been appointed a committee to confer
with representatives from the school
boards of San Francisco, Oakland and
Berkeley to the end that there may be
uniformity in the time for holding school
vacations in the cities named, especially
during the midsummer season. The
movement is the suggestion of the Ala
nieda County Teachers' Benefit Associa
tion. V ; 7; >';*>

A fro- American League Make* Charges
Against Its President.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 7. âThe Afro-
American State League has pre. erred
serious charges agniusi T. B. Morton, the
pre.^fdent. and he has been cited to appear
for trial at the headquarters of the league
at 876 Broadway on Tuesday evening,
April 27.
The charges all relate to politics and
allege that Morton was guilty of double
dealing with candidates in the recent San
Francisco municipal campaign. He is
also charged with pledging indorsements
of the league to particular candidates.
The circular calling the meeting concludes:
"Appended to these charges are the
sweeping charge* and exoose made against
T. B. Morion by W. E. Henderson, former
lecturer of tho league and political confi
dant in these matters of the president, of
receiving money from the political candi
dates for office, whether Republicans or
Democrats."
PUTTING UP

Berkeley Players Rounding
Rapidly Into Good
Form.

Hopes.
More Hopeful Ths Year for Succ ss
The Nine Which Will Meet
Stanford N m d.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 7.â The finish
ing touches are now being put on Berke
ley's baseball team in preparation for the
first of the three matcnes with Stanford
on Saturday. The nine has practically
been decided upon with the exception,
perhaps, of the center field and coachers.
Nott and Cohen have had the men we 1
in hand for some time, and are now de
voting their attention to teaching the
finer points of the game. Batting prac-
tice has been a feature of the course of
training laid during the past two weeks.
Nott has been teaching the boys how to
place balls and how to strike effectively,
with the result that they are doing vastly
better work than when" they followed no
scientific principles while at the bat.
The entire team 1% rounding into good
form and all the old players are out again.
Hennesey ana Krug. who played at first
and third respectively on last year's Var
sity nine, have recently been laid up with
sprained ankles, but are once more at
i heir places. The injuries to Krug and
Hennesey caused Berkeley's standard to
droop for a time, but with their return
hopes of a successful series of contests
against the Palo Alto players have been
renewed. Wheeler of last year's team is
certain of his place behind the bat.
Kaamburg will pitch in Saturday's
game against the Paio Alto nine and
Svke?, lU3 rival in the box, will hold down
one of the outiieia positions. Hennessy
will take his old place at tirst, though
slightly handicapped by his recent sprain.
Captain Elston is m fixture at second and
King at third. McLaren at short, though
erratic in the early past of the season, is
again in form and will bold his old place.
His batting is much better than last year.
In fact, all the men havo improved greatly
under the tutelage of Nott, who has been
making a specialty of batting in his in
struction.
The entire infield with the exception of
Kaarsbure, who takes Mordeu's place in
the box, is made up of 96 Varsity players.
This fact is looked upon as being consider
able of an advantage for the Berkeley
men. Several new men will be found in
the field clamoring for place* on the team.
Hoag is still the surest fielder, and he
will probably stay at left, with Sykes at
right.
As for center field Foster, Hall, Proctor,
Wilson an 1 Chesebrough each seem to
stand an equal chance of winning oat.
Hall is a likely man for this place, as he
is a hard hitter and a good base, runner. â 
The Berkeley men are depending for
their success very largely on their batting
and the work of Kaarsburg in the box.
They claim to have a better pitcher than
Stanford, and upon him and upon ttieir
work at the bat they base their hopes of
success.

PROSPERITY
DAWNS ON
WOOL MEN
Prices Sent Upward by the
New Administra
tion.
THE FOREIGN PRODUCT
IS TABOOED
An Unprecedented Awakening
and Large Buying Inaugu
rated.
A HEAVY DUTY ALREADY PRE
VAILS.
The Final Action of Congress on the
Dingley Bill Looked Forward To
With Joy.
It is not the dawn but the midday of
prosperity that now shines on the wool
growers of California as the result or the
incoming of the new Republican admin
istration.
After four years of dismal darkness and
stagnation of business in consequence of
the murderous free-trade policy of the
Democracy, ail iÂ« now light. There is a
boom on right now in the local market
sucb as has not been witnessed in a veri
table age. A complete reaction has sat
in and the woolmen are bubbling over
with joy.
The present rapid advance in prices is
acknowledged by buyers and growers
alike to be rather speculative for the time
being because of the fact that the new
tariff bill has not as yet passed through
the Senate and no deiinite duty rate lima
been decided upon, but nevertheless it is
considered more than safe specu'ation
and those wno are buying are satisfied
that they are taking no undue chances. It
is positively certain that Congress will
impose a heavy duty on foreign wool, but
jusi wnat tne rate will be is, of course, at
present purely a matter of conjecture.
The Dingley bill, as it left the House of
Kepresentatives, fixes the tax ai 11 cents a
pound, but it is the general Delief arrong
the wool men that when the Senate gets
through with the measure the rate will be
found to have been reduced. It may come
clown to 9 cents and possibly 8, but even
this will assure continuous prosperity.
The wool men feel confident that the duty
will go no iower.
In anticipation of the action of Congress
prices in the local market have already
advanced from 2 to 4 cents a pound on t jÂ«?
various qualities of â wool over tie prices
tliat pievailed last year. For example, in
1896 San Joaquiu "year's wool" brought
but 6>Â£ cents, ana in isolated cases 7}Â£
cents, while the present rate for the same
article ranges from &% to 10>Â£ cents.
Last year Los Angeles wool was quoted
at iy, cents, but now it cannot be bought
for less than 8 cents. Here is another:
Livermore wool averaged between 6% and
8 cents here in 1896, but now tney are
offering as nigh as 13 cents for it while it is
still on the sheeps' backs, and it is Hard to
get at that figure.
The buying of wool which is undipped â
that ip, wool which is still on the sheep â is
something that has not been done in these
parts, except in a few isolated cases, since
1872. But it constitutes the bulk of the
business being now transacted. It is
almost unprecedented, say the dealers, and
they see in it a prophecy of boom times.
Of course, there is a great deal of foreign
wool here at present, and more is coming
here over the sea. This will all have to be
worked off before the home product can
readily take possession of the American
market, and it is estimated that about a
year's time will be required to accomplish
it. But in the meantime, as the foreign
article is taken up and used, the home
wool will gradually till in the gap until
there is none of the competitive product
left.
The foreign supply will be increased by
the arrival of the cargoes that are now en
route in various sailing vessels, as these
will necessarily have to be admitted free
of duty; but any wool ordered after the
Ist of April will have the 11-cent duty im
posed upon it, and will therefore De a los
ing purchase.
"Yes, sir, these are great days for the
wool men," said Ed C. Denigan of the
firm of Thomas Demgan, Son & Co., yes
terday. "The market is on the jump and
there is every indication that prosperity
â will continue. We are all confident that
the tariff bill will go through all right
enough, bat of course do not know just
wnat the duty will be on foreign wool.
We are satisfied, though, that it will bo
sufficient to benefit the home producers.
They are certain to get some protection,
and heaven knows they need it.
"During the last four years we have had
a declining market. Now we have a
beautifully rising one, and naturally we
are all jubilant. In fact it has been so
long since we have seen any prosperity
sew to-sat:
Itching, irritated, scaly, crusted Scalps, dry, thin,
and falling Hair, cleansed, purified, and beauti-
fied by warm shampoos with CUTICUBA Soap,
and occasional dressings of Ccticuka, purest of
. emollients, the greatest skin cures, i
Treatment will produce a clean, healthy scalp
with luxuriant, lustrous hair. when all else fails. '

that we scarcely snow how to taue hold of
the new state of affairs. It all goes to
â how that the people knew what they
were doing when they plunked in their
votes for a complete change of the coun
try's policy."
CLarle? A. Hulrne of the iirm of Hulme
& Hart corroborated everything said by
Mr. Denigan â for that matter every wool
man in town did.
"Last year the California clip was
8,000,000 pound? short of what it had for
merly averaged," said Mr. Hulme, "and if
that is not evidence enough of the evils of
the free- trade policy I don't know what is.
This means a decrease of over 1.000,000
sheep. You see the growers were being
forced out of business. The present rise
of prices bids fair to put them on their
feet again, and I tell you it is high time,
for they were in desperate straits. Last
year's output was the smallest known in
California since 1834. What do you think
of that?"
And everybody says that times are go
ing to be better still. When ttie woo: men
prosper everybody else will, too, and
when the new tariff bill becomes the law
of the land it is conceded on ah sides that
the bard times whit h have so nearly deso
lated the land will quickly disappear.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 18fT.
OAKLAND
FAVORED
The Valley Road Would
Like to Have a Termi
nal There.
A CONFERENCE WITH
CLAUS SFRECEELS.
Avoidance of Damage Suits oi
Mire Concern Than Getting
Mere Franchises.
REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS AT
TEND.
Practical Exchange of Views Which
Has Clearly Opened the Way
for Negotiations.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
W)8 Broadway, April 7. )
Representative men of OaKland and of
the Valley Railroad have met and each of
the parties now know just, what the other
wants. A very practical conference was
held this afternoon at the City Hall. Tne
Valley road was represented br President
Claus Bpreckels, Vice-President Robert
Watt, Engineer Storey and Directors
Isaac Upnam, Thomas Magee, Captain
Payson and Louis Sioss.
Oakland was represented by Mayor
Tbonias, ex-Mayor Davie, Councilmen
Pnngle and Watkinson ; \V. V. Witcher,
president Merchants' Exchange; Supervi
sor Talcott, ex-Councilman Mott and
James P. Taylor, president of the Board
of Trade.
After a brief introduction among them
selves, the matter was at once taken up.
Ex-Mayor Davie stated that the right of
way for the Valley road in this city was
undoubtedly the chief feature to be de-
i cided. Vice-President Watt stated that a
franchise is not such an important matter
as a guarantee against damage suits trora
property-owners. "In the San Joaquin
I Valley." said Mr. Watt, "we hare already
j paid $10,000 or $12,000 in damage suits anil
i $40,000 against us is now pending."
Mr. Spreckels stated that the mere
cranting of a franchise is very little
trouble. "They told us there would be no
difficulty about a right of way in Stock
j ton," 'aid President Spreckels, "but we
j met with much difficulty. In Fresno we
| were given the right of way nnd found we
| had a grest many suits on our hands. In
j the San Joaquin Valley w* have had great
I trouble, nad land worth $30 an acre sud
denly increased to $1300 when we wanted
a piece of it. These are the matters
which are of great concern to us."
W. V. Witcher asked what the Valley
road would require to induce them to
j come into this city. He said that Oakland
; wanted a road, and by their presence here
; to-day the Valley road officials showed
that they wanted to come if they wÂ»re met
halfway. In reply to this Mr. Spreckels
| said that they could not at this time say
| exactly what wo'ild be required.
After further discussion Vice-President
Watt mado the following statement: "We
have two considerations. In the first
place we have found a southern entrance
to Oakland, and this Is a good one, for it
reaches all the southern towns of impor
tance and is on the war so that we could
establish a branch line to San Jose. The
proposed northern route is not so de
sirable, because the grades are very heavy.
It would take us through Castro Valley,
but we would have to send our trains np
an 80-foot grade and through a (XXKMoot
tunnel at Conal Hollow. The Southern
Pacific hauls on heavy grades in the
Sierras, but we want to obviate this if pos
sible. The Southern Pacific's grades in
the mountains are not over fifty feet to the
mile, but there is a great difference be
tween this and eighty lees.
"The Goat Island terminus which has
been suggested is a good one, and it would
give us a Delter route to San Francisco as
well as an entrance to Oakland
"Now with relation to the California and
Nevada line, I do not know what we
I could do with it. A portion of the right
of way may be available if it can be se
cured, but we would then have to run up
through the hills north of Livermore.
Point Richmond is 7.7 miles from the foot
of Market street, and in front of the piers
we have ample waterâ as much as seven
fathoms â as well as ample room lor all
purposes required."
Claus Spreckels then declared that the
Valley road would like to come to Oak
land. He said: "We want to come to
Oakland if we can. Why shouldn't we
come in? There are plenty of people here
and good advantages for us if we can see
our way clear to reach the city. This is a
plain business proposition, and of course
we are looking out for the best interests
of the corporation we represent. If it be
within the power of Oakland, and I be
lieve it is, to offer such advantages as will
make it best for the city and best for us to
come here, why, we want to come."
Mr. Watt supplemented Mr. Sprcckelt'
remarks by saying that the Valley road
has not enough money on hand to build
into this city ai this time, but with assist
ance it migut be possible. Various de
tails were then discussed and the confer
enca broke up with the understanding
that Oakland was willing to make a;iy
effort within reason to obtain the road
and that the directors were willing: to
come if sufficient inducements oe offered.
As soon as the visitors nad departed the
Oakland committee held a short meeting,
at which it was agreed that a representa
tive executive committee of fifteen should
be appointed to carry on negotiations
with the Valley road.
Next Friday aiternoon a meeting will be
held, at which the full committee will be
appointed, which will then get to work at
once to find out what is necessary to
bring the road here and how to acquire it.

CAUSED A BIG SURPRISE
Fred Raab's Carnival Buttons
Were Not Wei
ccme.
They Were Made in Cincinnati ani
the Improvement C obi
Obj -cted.
The principal business transacted by
the Federated Improvement Club* at its
meeting last nigtu was in connection with
the proposed carnival of the Go. den Gate.
After the disposition of some routine
work President George R. Fletcher called
for the report of the committee on the
carnival. Tne report proposed to assess
each subordinate club $10 and $1 for each
delegate for the purpose of building a
float representing tne improvement
if a: ares of the City through the mliueuce
of the clubs.
In harmony with the objects of the
committee's recommendation W. M. Weil
and Fred Raab, who represented the !
executive committee of the carnival and!
who were present, were invited ioswuk.
Weii won the applause irorn the d-j.e
--gaies. After him cumo Fred Raab, less
e.oquent but equally as forcible, and at
the conclusion of his remarks lie pro
duced a handful of carnival souvenirs in
the shape of lapel button?, which ware
aistribuiod round to tin- member*.
Then il was ibat \V. J. Williams raised
trouole. Ue observed that iliese buttons
were manufactured in Cincinnati, Ohio,
ai.d lost rnj time in stating bis discovery.
This was a surprise and had the effect
,-nu.ktr to what a red blau&et would if
thrown into a bull-pen.
Great excitement followed, and a ma
jority of the members spoke in opposition
to the moneyed feature of the recom
mendation, while others favored the with
drawal <>; tlie club's delegates to the car
nival committee.
Delegate A. Barendt, however, threw
oil on the troubled waters by offering a
resolution mat the club tender its moral
support to the carnival and recommend
;ng the financial question to the consider
ation of the individual clubs. TJlia was
unanimously adopted, and the button
question ended.
Delegates M. V. Stevens, O. Balzarini,
R. Kirk, K. A. Daniels and J. H. Lytgens
were seated from the New Park Lane
Club.
Or. Halsfield offered a resolution request
ing tne Park Commissioners to provide a
roadway within the park limits from
Third avenue and H street to Stanyan
street for the accommodation of the
residents of the Sunset district.
The committee on nuisances was in
structed to investigate and if nead be take
legal action for the abatement of the
Tetiama-street Carpet-beating Works.
Messrs. Williams, Lang and McEwen
were appointed a committee on a bridle
road in the park.

Talent.
The Manhattan Athletic Club has com
pleted arrangements for a grand pugilis
tic faatival, which will be held at Wood
ward's Pavilion on the evening of April
17 and half of the proceeds will be donated
to the relief committee for the benefit of
the unemployed. The coroinnteo that
Las charge of the arrangements, F. Mul
ler, J. Killeen and G. V. Ferris, con
templates making vast improvements in
tne pavilion, with an eye to the comfort
of the spectators. The talent that has
been engaged lor the occasion is as fol
lows:
Four-round contest, 145 pounds, between
John La hoy. M. A. A., and J. Kane, M. A. A.
*our-round contest, 130 pound*, tetweenJ.
Reiily and Joe Sullivan.
Four-round contest, 130 pounds, between
Ben Lewis and Patsy Daly.
Four-round contest. 125 pounds, between
Jack King and Yank Sivage of Australia.
Ten-round contest, 112 pounds, for bantam
championship of me Pacific Coast, between
Fred Vaughan, 112-pound champion M. A. A.,
and "Buck" Evtrson.
Ten-round content, 135 pounds, for light
weight championship of ihe Pacific Cosst, be
tween Fred Mullcr. 13d-pouud champion M.
A. A., and Charley Rocnette.
"Dal" Hawkins is out with a challenge
to nght "Kid" Lavigne for the champion
ship, "provided" tbat Mr. Lavigne will
weigh 1lÂ»8 pounds at the ringside." Sport
ing men udmit that Hawiins is a clever
feJlow and a hard puncuer, but they snake
their head when "Dal" mentions the
champion lightweight as one of his pros
spective opponents. Hawkins must be
looking for a little advertising, as he cer
tainly is aware that Lavigne cannot get
down to 128 pounds without entering the
ring in a weak state. Hawkins should
take on nis old opponent Gans, of Balti
more, again before making overtures to
the champion.
The directors of the Olympic Club are
puzzled to know why the pugilists de
mand such heavy purses from them when
they have fought under the auspices of
Eastern clubs lor almost half the amount

they demand from the Olympic. They
cite as i-.n illustration Henry Ryan's re
lusal to meet George Green ;or a purse of
$4000 when records will prove that Ryan
has fought in the East for parses not half
us large as the one that he refused a few
days ago. Howard Taylor, the leader of
the Olympic Club, is now satisfied that
Ryan la afraid of Green, ana that is the
reason why he demands a purse which he
knows the club cannot afford to give for
a contest of this kind. The club is now in
correspondence, with the managers of
"Kid Layigne and McKeever, and if it
can arrange terms that will be satisfactory
to all concerned, the pugilists will do
battle in this City under the auspices ot
tne Olympic Club tome evening in the
first week of May.
The beftine on the fight between Jef
fries and Van Buskirk is getting spirited.
The Lob Angeles champion is a slight
favorite, but it is said that a large cum of
money has been subscribed by the em
ployes of a power-house of a certain street
car line to be placed on Van Buskirk this
evening. The fight should be a hummer
from the call of time, as the heavy-weights
are hard hitters who will go in for a
knockout and a quick, finish. Both men
are said to be in first-class trim.
The Olympic Club directors will meet
this evening to discuss the prosDective
boxing entertainment in May, and on
Friday evening the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation will convene at the Olympic Ciub
and discuss the question of seceding ironi
the Amateur Athletic Union and forming
a Pactfie CoaÂ«t athletic asÂ»ociaiion, which
winch will arrange matters so as to please
the disgruntled athletes of the different
clubs that compose the association.
OAffNOT GET THE MONET.
The Protestant Orphan Asylum De
prived of the Uirron Bequest.
When the late Edward Barron died he
left an estate valued at about two million
dollars. Of this amount $5000 wa*, accord
in}; to his will, to go to the San Francisco
Protestant Orpnim Asylum. George
Barron, ;on of the deceased, made a con
test of the will in the courts in San Jose
on the ground that his parent was of un
sound mind ana that he was unduly in
fluenced by hi* wife. He succeeded in
breaking the will and a new trial of the
matter was ordered aud the case is still
pending.
The officials of the asylum association
insisted on the probate of the will and
set up the claim th*t the ion in beginning
the action did not legally serve them with
a notice witnin one year alter the will
was filed for probate. The lower court de
cided that proper notice had been served,
so the association applied to the Supreme
Court for a writ of certiorari to compel
the iower court to annul its order. The
aptilicntion was denied.
