AT LAST THE CLASH OCCURS.
An Invasion of Irregulars Resented by the
Ottoman Troops, Who Are Demanding
the Blood of Their Hated
Christian Foes*
LONDON', Eire , April 9.â The Evening
News publish* s a late dispatch from
Elas-ona, headquarters of Edhem Pasha,
command?r-in-chief of the Turkish Jorces
in Macedonia, giving the details <f a
battle between Greeks and Turks. It is
not known whetner the Greeks are the
same body described in an earlier dis
patch as having crossed the frontier and
were attacked by Turks, but as the fight
ing is reported in both instances in the
vicinity of Grevena it is likely that the
Greeks, whom the first dispatch said were
brigands, were really irregular troops wbo
have advanced into Turkish territory de
spite the orders of Crown Prince Constan
tine. If this be the case it will render the
situation, already perilous, far more so
CRETANS DEFY THE POWERS.
LONDON, ENG., April 9.â A dispatch to ihe Daily News from Canea states
that the Austrian warship Crown Princess Stefani arrived yesterday at Kissamo,
which is being besieged by the insurgents. As the warship approached she hoisted
a flag of truce. Later she sent a boat with two soldiers to carry mails for the
Turkish fort. The insurgents, unheeding the flag, fired on the boats. The warship
replied with quick-firing and six-inch guns, speedily quieting the insurgents.
To-day the Crown Princess Stefani sent a number of boats to town to embark
Moslems who hzd expressed a strong desire to leave. The insurgents again fired on
the toats, whereupon all the warships in the bay took part in bombarding the
Christians. They fired eighty shells. The rebels found the gunnery practice so
gocd that they ceased tue fusillades on the boats until after they had taken the
refugees on board. The beats embarked twenty-seven women, children and old
men. After they started for the Austrian gunboat Sebenico, which was to take the
refugees to Canea, the insurgents again fired upon them. Ihe Serenico, after
Isncing the refugees at Canea, started back for Kissamo to get other Moslems
whose capture is daily threatened.
and may result in open hostilities be- t
tween ibe two armies on the frontier
without the formality of an actual declara- '
tion of war.
At 3 o'clock this morning a thousand
Greeks, under cover of the darkness, I
crossed the frontier aoout twenty miles
southwest of Grevena. The Greeks were
discovered by the TurKish outposts of the
second line, who tired upon them and
then fell back upon their own main body.
Orders were immediately given for the
Turks to attack.
At 5 o'clock the Greeks were surrounded
in the forest. The nature of the ground
made it impossible for the Turks to deliver
an effective lire, the Greeks being protected
by the trees. The latter replied briskly to
to the Turks' fire and succeeded in check
ing their advance. At the lime the dis
patch was sent the fighting was proceeding
vigorously.
The Greeks were holding their own.
Artillery was being hurried to the scene.
It is thoueht that if this be brought into
action, the Greeks will be speedily dis
lodged.
It is impossible to ascertain whether
there are any regular troops among the
Greeks, but the band is so Urge that it
suggests that probability. If this be so,
fighting alone the whole frontier is ine
vitable.
Edhetu Pasha will advance immediately
if he learns that regulars are takine part
in the fij;ht. Orders to that effect have
been issu.-d. It would not be surprising
if the whoie Turkish army soon advances
into Greece.
The situation is extremely critical.
Actual war was never so near since the
troubles began. Secret telegrams are con
stantly passing between the military com
mander at Grevena and the Porte.
ELASfcONA, Trr.KEY, April 9. â The
Greek force that this morning invaded
Turkish territory has held out so desper
ately against the Turks that Edhem Pasha
sentorti rs to Hakti Pasha, commander
of the Turkish division at Grevena, to
move against the Greeks. The greater
part of Hakki Pasha's division is now ad
vancing against the invaders, and a bloody
light is expected. The troops are enthu
siastic over an opportunity for an engage-*
nient with the hnted Christians.
Edhem i'asha iias notified all the gen
erals to hold their commands in readiness
Tor instant action. The reservists have
Jeit the encampment here in order to
move closer to the line of defense. This
cil y is to-day the scene of the greaiest
military activity.
The insurgents at Kissimo have kept
their promise to treat the foreign aa
rnirals as enemies. The news from there
â¢hows they have nred upon the Austrian

warship, which replied, silencing the
guns of the insurgents.
PI.AIST OF 111E PORTE.
Desires the Power * to Settle the Trouble
Without Delay.
LONDON, Eng., April 9.â lt is under
stood here that the Porte has presented a
note to the powers complaining of the
crisis hurting the Ottoman exchequer and
requesting the governments to hasten a
settlement. A Constantinople dispatch
pays the official opinion is that the powers
are losing their hold upon the course oi
events, owing to France's proposals being
favorable to Greece and the likelihood of
their acceptance.
In the House of Commons to-day Sir R.
Webster, Attorney- General, said the pow
ers had not yet decided whether they
woulrl establish a blockade of Greece in
the event of her final refusal to withdraw
her troops from Crete.
There was a stormy scene in the Italian
Chamber of Dputies to-day when the
Marquis Visconti Ver.osta declared the
pohcy of Italy regarding Crete. He urced
the necessity of Italy remaining in con
cert as a means of averting a general out
break. Nevertheless, he said, the Govern
ment woulJ act always in a conciliatory
spirit toward Greece.

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, APRIL 10, 1897
Where Yesterday's Fighting Took Place Between the Turks and Greeks.
For weeks past troops have been concentrating near the Green frontierâ the Turks at Salonica and the Greeks at Lanssa,
Arta and Prevesa. Latterly they have been gradually advancing toward each other, and a few days ago a strong detachment'
of Greeks crossed the border. They seem to Lave encountered a Turkish force near Grevena yesterday, where some lively
fighting took place. If present signs do not fail it is in this part of Macedonia that a battle may be looked for within a short
time.
CUBANS WIN A DECISIVE BATTLE.
In a Hand-to-Hand Conflict the Insurgents
Drive the Spaniards From the
Fieldâ Barbarity in Porto
Rico.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 9.â A big battle has bÂ«en lought at Ban Miguel, Pinar del Kio proTince, betwsen the Spanish
battalion of Gerona and 1000 insurgents, led by Vidal Ducasse and Perico Deigado. Alter a hand-to-hand fight the Spanish
retired, leaving on the field their dead, wounded, and horses, arms and ammunition.
Since Maceo's time no other battle of such importance has been fought in the province. The Spanish explain the combina
tion of two columns, which were to attack the Cubans on two sides, failed. They say the battalion of Gerona was ordered to
maintain without help a bad position to encourage the insurgents to attack and th.en drive them to a certain place, at which the
other battalion was expected to overwhelm the patriot force. The Cubans captured 200 rifles and 300,000 rounda of
ammunition.
An expedition has landed fifteen miles from Havana, at Punta del Indio.
A dispatch from Madrid says the contract for a loan which the Government decided to make from the Banco de Espana has
been signed, the bank advancing $10,000,000 in Spanish silver and agreeing to give $20,000,000 more if asked by the Minister of
Finance. Althongh the wording is pesetas and silver, it is well understood the bank Days in its own paper money and the whole
contract means only authorization by the Government to enlarge its issue of currency.
General Garcia has sent to the Government at Camaguey a communication giving the news of the safe landing of Roloff'i
I expedition, and saying: "The Junta at New York deserves all the praise of the patriots for the important effort which will
I hasten the triumph of Cuba." General Garcia adds that if the Junta is not thwarted by the American authorities the inde-
pendence of Cuba can soou be achieved. General Roloff has started for Gamagu ey to join the Government.
In Santa Clara province Gomez is harassing the Spanish columns and the Spanish are unable to force him to retire toward
Jucaro-Moron trocha, where Weyler plans to catch Gomez between two fires. A. private report from Santiago de Cuba says
Garcia has captured, near Manzanillo, the Spanish general Aldave, and that the insurgents are willing to exchange him for
Rivera. Though the report is denied by the authorities a long disDatch has been sent about it to Weyler. , Rivera waa brought
here this afternoon from San Cristobal and lodged in Cabanas fortress.
ONE HUNDRED MEN TORTURED TO DEATH.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 9.â News of the revolt in Porto Rico was known to the authorities two weeks ago, but was sup
pressed by the censor. Now there are reports of atrocities committed by the Spaniards at Yauco and Adjuntas, where more
than 100 men were killed by torture known as componte.
The whole island of Porto lUco has been terrorized, and the people are beginning to flÂ«e to Santo Domingo. The revolution
was well planned, but Quineros Velez rose prematurely March 24 against the orders of the principal secssionists. The leaders
had named a later day, expecting help from New York.
DIRT WAS
PILED UPON
THE RAILS
Two Cars of the Sutro
Line &ash Into Each
Other.
WAS THE WORK OF A FIEND.
B* A* Bosqui Painfully Injured and Several
. More of the Passengers of Both
. Cars Very Badly Shaken
Up.
Obstructions placed upon the track of
the Sutro electric road last night derailed
one of the cars, it crashing into another
going in the opposite direction and en
dangering tbe lives of several passengers.
The accident happened on the crude
just back of the cemetery, at the corner of
Richmond and Commonwealth avenues.
The car was crowded, the night being fine,
and at that time, 8:30 o'clock, there was a
larger crowd than usual poing to and from
the Cliff House and Sutro Baths.
After :urning the curve back of the
cemetery the westbound car was going
down the grade at the usual rate of speed,
six or eicin miles, when the motorman sud
denly felt the front wheels jump and jolt
over some obstruction, and then go off ihe
track. He at once reversed the electric
current and put on the brakes, but before
he could check the headway of the car an
eastbound car of the tame line swung up
just in time to collide with the derailed
westbound one.
The passengers on both cars felt a sud
den jar. Those in the front part, which
is open and served the purposes of a
dummy, felt mure than the shock, for sev
eral were thrown off on their faces in the
road, and one or two were cut by flying
fragments of glass.
B. A. Bosqui, who resides at 751 Sutter
street, was the only passenger seriously
injured. His left ankle was sprained and
his right foot and ankle were badly
bruised. He was conveyed in the police
ambulance to the City Receiving Hospi
tal, where his wounds weredressad, after
which he was taken home in a hack. He
is a son of Bosqui, the well-known printer
and engraver.
Mrs. Taylor and her daughter, who
were on the front part of the westbound
car, were roughly shaken up, but fortu
nately escaped injury.
A man sitting near the large convex
panes of glass in front of the open part of
the car had his face cut by three pieces of
glas?. The cuts, however, were only su
perficial.
The front of the westbound conveyauce
and the side of the car eastbound were
broken, and all the windows in the latter
were smashed.
The cra-h of the collision attracted the
attention of the nurses at the Children's
Hospital, which is opposite the scene of
the coilis.on about 2iX) yards away, and
they were promptly on the scene with
st cking-plaster and lint bandages, but
their services were not required except in
tuo case of the young man whose lace was
scratched.
Young Bosqui was in great pain as he
lay on the operating table in the Receiv
ing Hospital while the surgeons dressed
and bound his injured feet. He said:
"I was on the front of the westbound
car, and when we went down the grade
just back of the cemetery the car went at
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
great speed. Suddenly I felt a jar and
grinding of the front wheels, as though
they had left the rails. Then we crashed
into the eastbound car and I was thrown
violently to tie ground. I was so badly
hurt that I could not waltc, and I am now
in great pain. Just beiore the cars came
together I was about to jump off, but we
were going so fast I was afraid I would
get run over, and so I remained on the
car."
E. M. Van Frank, superintendent of the
road, says the wreck gave every evidence
of being the result of a deliberate attempt
to wreck the cars.
"The accident happened about half-past
8 o'clock last evening," he said, "and it
was undoubtedly the work of some mis
creant who, I suopose, had a erud ge
against the road. There was a car going
west and as it approached the corner of
Richmond and Commonwealth avenues s
car sroing ea>t came toward it.
"Just before the west ound car reached
the corner it left the track, and turning a
little to the side collided with the east
bound car. The steps of both cars were
splintered and the passengers were badly
shaken up. The westbound car was well
under control, as it was only going at six
or eight miles an hour. The eastbound.
car was going up the grade at about
seven miles an hour.
"I went at once to the scene of the acci
dent, and then it was 1 saw the wreck had
been a deliberate attempt upon tiie safety
of the cars. For a distance of fifteen feet
all four rails had been buried four inches
deep under the loose macadam from the
street. The one who did it had scraped
the loose rock up and had carefully
smoothed it over the rail, and as the road
way between the rails is also macadam
ized it was impossible for the motorman
to see the obstruction in time.
"Of course, where the westbound car
had reached the macadam it had crashed
through it, but the eastbound car had
been stopped by the collision, and in front
of it 1 saw where the trap had been care
fully set for it. The roadway alongside
the tracks is of this loose stuff, not rolled
or watered, and is built up hieh as the
rails. Tue roadbed between the rails is
also of macadam, loose like that on the
crossway, and it was an easy matter for
any one to go along and scrape the stuff
up from eacd side until the rail was
deeply buried. *
"The cars were running on five minutes'
headway, and the cars, both east and
west bound, ahead* of those which col
lided had passed over the very point of
the derailment only a few minutes before.
"The matter has been placed in the
hands of tne police. I have no knowledge
of any one or any reason for any one
doing tucli a thing. It might have been
a horrible accident, and I cannot see what
could prompt any one to cause it."

At Least Two Thoussnd of Them to

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.âSecre
tary of the Tieasury Gagp received a tele
gram to-aay saying that 180 Chinese emi
grants would arrive to-morrow at .Portal,
N. Dak., on the Canadian line. The Col
lector of Customs for that district said the
Chinese were on the way to Nashville to
take part in the Tennessee centennial ami
would claim admission to the United
States by authority of a joint resolution
of Congress permitting alien laborers to
be imported in connection with foreign
exhibits. The Collector wanted to know
what he should do. The Secretary im
mediately held a consultation with Chief
Crowley of the special agents' division,
wno has charge of the matter pertaining
to the Chinese exclusion laws.
A study of the joint resolution showed a
pretty serious state of affairs. Its pro
visions are so broad that the country is in
danger of a Chinese invasion To make
matters worse the Trassury Department
l.as received information that large num
bers of Chinese, intended tor Nashville.
expected to arrive shortly at San Fran
cisco and Seattle, and the estimates given,
together with the party bound for Portal,
show no less than '2000 Chinese laborers
who claim the righi to enter. It is feared
by the treasury officials that others will
endeavor to gain admission in the same
way, and a wholesale attempt to evade
the exclusion law will follow.
The joint resolution was adopted by
Congress nearly a year ago. Last December
the Treasury Department issued a circu
lar to the custom* and immigration offi
cers and special agents containins instruc
tions about the matter and dealing with
contract laborers who would come under
it. The resolution provides that the alien
contract-labor law and the Chinese ex
clusion lawÂ« are not to be construed to
prevent any foreign exhibitor from bring
ing into the country under contract such
mechanics a< he may deem necessary for
making preparations for installing or con
ducting the exhibits. A proviso says, "No
alien shall be permitted to enter under
contract unless by express permission
granted by the Secretary ot the Treasury.
Any sucli alien wno remains in the coun
try more than a year after the exposition
is to be subject to the penalties of the
alien contract laborer."
Chief Crowley will send instructions to
collectors to secure the identification of
the Chinese in each party and not to ad
mit any without evidence that the person
in charge has a concession for a Chinese
exhibit in Nashville. The World's Fair
and the Cotton States Exhibition at At
lanta brought over a large number of
Chinese. Some never went back, despite
the efforts of the Treasury Department.
SEAL COMMISSIONERS CGNFER.
Devising Means 1o Step the Bering Sea
Slaughter â England Is Shirking
Her Duty.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 9.â Ex-
Becretary John Foster and Charles HÂ»ra
lin, formerly Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury, the Commissioners to be ap
pointed by President McKinley to devise
means tor preserving the seals, had a
conference to-day. They will begin work
by examining the long report made by
David Starr Jordan on the condition of
affairs in Bering Sea. General Foster will
remain here ani Mr. Hamlin will come
on from Boston every month or so to
consult with him.
Before the President went awai' he and
Sherman looked thoroughly into the rep
resentations made about the wholesale
slaughter of seals and came to the con
clusion that Great Britain was no; doing
hsr part to stop the butchery. Just before
he went out of office Olney sent a note to
Pauncefote, the British Embassador, sug
gesting that the British and United States
Governments adopt better regulations.
Sir Julian replied that the matter was in
the hands of Canada and be did not feel
justified in interfering.
It is understood that President We-
Kinley has already concluded what course
to pursue. Proposals will be made to
Great Britain to enter into another modus
vlvendi for the present season, the two
Governments to negotiate in the mean
time regarding new regulations, in order
that harmonious action in preserving seal
life may be secured. Officials here expect
this proposal wili be rejected. The Presi
dent has decided, in that event, that a
fleet of naval vessels and revenue cutters
shall be sent to Bering Sea, to show Great
Britain that this Government intends to
no all it can to protect the seais. This
fltet, if sent, will maintain the strictest
eort of patrol.

CONSTRUCTOR AND
REAR-ADMIRAL
An Interesting Controversy
Between Bunce and
Hichborn.
Strictures Concerning Modern
War Vessels That Are
Resented
Bui ders Declare They Know More
Abmt Slips Than 0 ficers Who
Navigate Them.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 9.â A con
troversy has arisen between Naval Con
structor Hicbborn and Admiral Bunce
over the strictures cast by the admiral
upon the vesseis of his fleet designed by
the Construction Bureau.
Bunce wants the superstructure re
moved from the monitors, so that free
play will be given the wavis i;i breaking
across the decks. The aJiniral has found
numerous objections with a number of
other vessels of the fleet.
Bichborn replied spiritedly, statin? that
nothing was the matter with the vessel?.
He intimates that he knows more at.out
construction than the admiral.
The controversy beiran with a letter
from Captain Jewell of the Marblehead, in
which he related an experience in heavy
Hatteras seas, and intimated the vessel
should be changed before being sent to
sea again. Bunce indorsed this. The
need of a light spardeck to the Marble
head was also recommended.
To strengthen the argument the ad
miral recites that two little coastwise
steamers passed the Marblehead in the
height of a gale while she laid to making
bad weather.
Hichborn says as the stability of the
three vessels of the Marblehead class are
so well known to the navy he cannot be
lieve that Btince intended to suggest
an additional deck upon the vessel, but
â  imply meant to criticize the poop and
forecastle of the ship 1 ' generally.
"The bureau regrets," says the con
structor, "that (1 ist in. mi. s lied < fficers
should make such unnecessary sugges
tions for chan.-es in shiiÂ»3 wliicti n& thor
oughly satisfactory, and in doing so have
brought unwarranted discredit not only
upon a vessel but upon the whole Ameri
can navy."
WHO PULLED HIS GUN FIRST?
V.tal Question in a Kansas Murder Trial
That Has Aroused Intense
Public Interest.
WICHITA, Kas., April 9.â The prelim
inary hearing in the case of J. V. Cun
ningham, Deputy United States Marshal
of Abiiene, Texas, c'narged with the mur
der of Joseph B. McMahon in ihe corridor
of the Manhattan Hotel on April 2, was
had before Justice Jones to-day in the Ap
pellate Court room. The case was dis
cussed a good deal last evening, and it
seems to be pretty well understood that a
strong effort will be made to get Cunning
ham out on bail.
The prosecution was conducted by Sam
Amidon and Mr. Conley, while Judee
Wnll and A. E. Helm of th's city and K.
K. Leggett of Abilene, Texas, and Judge
Lindspv of Comanche, Texas, conducted
tue d( fense. At 6 o'clock all ihe evidence
w.-.s in and the case will be argued to-mor
row.
There never was such crowd at any
criminal trial in the Wichita courthouse,
the local prominence of the men having
aroiibcd the utmost interest. Cunning
ham was surrounded by many friends,
among \v om was United States Marshal
Love of Texas. Public santiment has
greatly changed, and people who a fuw
days aero .thought Cunningham acted
rashly now think the shooting waa j.istili
able. The testimony to-day showed that
McMahon provoked Cunningham irreatlv,
and the question now arises as to whether
McMahon drew his gun first. There are a
great many wealthy stockmen from Texas
and Kansas here ready to go on Cunning
ham's bond should hebe admitted to bail.

TOPEKA. Kaxs., April 9.â lnteresting
developments were brought out in toe
committee appointed to investigate brib
ery in the last Kansas Legislature. The
testimony given this morning by Speaker
Street of the last Legislature . was de
cidedly sensational and will undoubtedly
lend to criminal prosecutions.
Street testified that when the uniform
text book bill was be:orÂ« the Legislature
he was approached by a representative of
the American Book Trust who offered to
pay to him $50j0 if lie would apply the
two-thirds ruling in the bill, or to pay him
$2000 i* the hill were killed.
Street testified that he had refuted
these offers and that then the go-between
had offered to pay him $1000 if he would
promise to "keep mum" on what had
occurred.
Two other members of the last Legis
lature testified that they baa been offered
bribes for their votes in the railroad bill.

CHICAGO'S MISSING BANKER.
Says He Will Face the Mus c on Monday
and Satisfactorily Explain His
Transactions.
CHICAGO, 111., April 9â President
Spalding of the Globe Savings Bank and
treasurer of the Illinois University, who
was custodian of over $500,000 of State
University funds that have disappeared,
says that he will return on Monday.
Meantime, detectives are looking for him
with a warrant, one of a batch Issued last
night for A. D. Averill *nd Charles E.
Churchill, vice-president and cashier re
spectively of the Globe Bank. The war
rants charge the officers of the bank with
embezziemeDt, and are sworn out by Frank
E. Stone of the firm of Stone & Francis,
which tirm was a depositor at the G.'obe,
and the charge is also male that money
was received niter the officers knew the
institution was insolvent Churchill and
Averill furnished bonds to-day for their
appearance on April 19.
At the univeraitv trustees' meeting on
Tue-day Spalcllnj; will be asked to frVJ an
account of the money. It is said that his
accounts have not been audited for over
two years. The university has his bond
for more than enough to cover the trust,
but there is no certainty that tha bond
can be realized.
Meantime the case assumes the aspect
of v chase between the university and the
Chicago Title and T^ust Company for the
tirst claim on the property of Spalding.
Leman. vice-president ol the trust com
pany, acting for the depositors of the
Globe Bank, has secured judgments
against all property under the control of
Spaldinp which has not been turned over
to the trust company as receivers for the
defunct bank.
Friends of Rpaldinj, say he is under
medical treatment in this city. On
Wednesday Francis McKay, president of
the board of trustees, and Professor Shat
tuck, business agent of the board, found
Spaiding'n private secretary. He Â£nÂ»lly
consented to tafceSnattuck to see Spa/ding
on condition that he should not reveal
Spalding's whereabouts. Yesterday Shat
tuce reported to the board that he had
found Spalding apparently very sick,
and that his physician forebade an ex
tended inter\iew. Spalding briefly told
him that next week he would account sat
isfactorily for the funds of the university.
The trustees have no means of ascertain
in^ whether Spalding has hypothecated
any of the bonds.
MANY SEE AN AIRSHIP.
Several Hundred Residents o
Nebraska Will Â£wear They
Are Not Mistaken.
la lowa the Winged Visitant of the
Night Is Also Observed
by Crtwls.
OMAHA, Nebr., April 9.â Several hun
dred persons arc ready to swear that an
airship of gigantic proportions has been
hovering over this city at night for some
time. Sit months ago it was heard of in
the interior of the Stale and since then
has been seen in other parts of Nebraska.
During the last two weeks it has been seen
almost nightly in this city. Invariably
the descriptions have been the same.
More persons have seen the great head
light of the machine than the outlines of
the vessel, although a great many say
they have eeen the full outlines of the
ship itiel!.
Tne general verdict is that the ship has
a long steel body, shaped like a cigar,
about forty feot long, six to ten feet in
diameter, winglike attachments on the
sides, while fore and aft appear wheellike
devices rimilar to the stearins Apparatus
of steamships. Toe top Is capped with a
balloon-like bug, oblong and seemingly
attached to the vessel by ropes. The
headlight is similar to that of a locomo
tive.
The first instance in which the ship has
been seen on the ground was reported
lrorn Wolf Creek Township, lowa, just
across the river. Richard Builer, a very
well-to-do farmer, says he saw the ship
while driving home Wednesday night.
He describes it as a long, narrow car re
sembling a corset-box thirty feet in length,
six or seven in width and the same in
height. Over the car floated a cigar
shaped bag horizontally placed of about
the same lengto. Whether there were
sailing or steering apparatus Builer can
not say, for ihe horses caught sight of the
vessel, bolted for the opposite aide of the
road and tumbled the wagon and driver
into a Hitch. By t c time Butler cruwled
from the wreck the machine was moving
briskly in a southerly direction. Several
hundred Omaha peoplo also saw the ship
Wednesday.
BURLINGTON, lowa, April 9.â An air
sbip was seen last night by man y along
the line of the Burlington, GedÂ«r Rapids
and Northern Kailroad, and it was the
chief topic of conversation to-day. Many
described the machine as havinp a head
light like that of a locomotive. They
were able to see wingliite projections on
each side. The airship appeared about
7:30, in-cording to all reports, traveled
northwest, and finally disappeared acro-s
the Minnesota State line. Home say they
heard a hissing noise as the craft elided
through the air, but only when the craft
was in swift motion, however. The craft
was supposed 10 be 10C0 feet about the
earth. It is seen only after dark, and it U
impossible to distinguish it but for the
light which often is not turned on until
the thip is directly over a city.

ARMY MEN AND
POLICE CLASH
Sensational Raid on the
Gamblers at Fort
McPherson.
But the Boys in Blue Now
Resent the Interference of
State Oificers
Officers and Privates Appeal to tbe
War Department for Aid in
the Fight.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 9.â An interest
ing tight is on between the State and
Federal authorities over the right of the
United States army to gamble. At Fort
McPherson barracks, where tue Fifth in
fantry is stationed, the officers and privates
are permitted to partible to their hearts'
content. A few days ago consternation
struck the swellesi society in Atlanta
with the announcement that the police
had raided Fort McPherson, capturing a
larve number of prisoners.
The evidence lid to a score of indict
ments, set for trial to-day. The moment
the news of the raid get abroad the entire
United States army rallied to the support
of the accused comrades. A number of
high officials here vigorously protested
through ttie ablest counsel obtainable.
They secured a postponement of the hear
ing to-day.
The defendants claim they are not sub
ject to arrest except by the Federal au
thorities. The prosecution claims the
State has jurisdiction. The War Depart
ment at Washington is backing the men.
The soldiers say the honor of the army is
at stake. The army regulations do not
forbid parubling, but it has frequently
been subject to orders issued by the Secie
tary of War in specific cases.
CHICAGO POLITICIAN SHOT.
An Off-nstve Partisan Decoyed to a Lone
ly Spot and Seriously Wounded
by Two Strangers.
CHICAGO. 111.. April 9.â L. G. Mata
lene, who lives at 75 North Clark street,
was shot in the left side near ;he heart last
nipbt at the foot of Chicago avenue by
one oÂ» two men, who, he says, decoyed
him to that lonesome spot by a false in
vitation to a recention of the Delaware
Boat Club. Matalene resisted the attack,
and as his assailants were attempting to
escape tired two shots at them. One of
the men fell, and Matalene is of the opin
icn that he was wounded.
Matalene told the police that the cause
of the shooting was revenge for his action
in the recent political fight in the Twenty
lourih Ward. Matalene had spent much
time in furthering the interests of James
J. Gray, candidate for North Town As
sessor. He also sent out 1400 circulars in
bis own name requesting his friends to
vote for Gray. In these circulars no per
sonal allusions were made to the opposi
tion;
The Bight before election a letter was
received by Maialene. In this letter whs
one of Gray's cards with the eyes of the
picture torn out und the face mutilated.
On the reverse aide was a skull and cross
bones and the warning:
If you don't stop knocking Carpenter and
Andrews we will get you. Unknown.
This warning was made sport of in the
clubrooms and no fear was felt for the re
sult. Matalene continued to work for
his candidate, the opponent of Carpenter
and Andrews.'
The assault that was made last night, j
Mstalene says, shows a clearly planned
plot. Friends of the injured man !
say they do not think the defeated candi
dates had anything to do with it and put
furth the opinion that the assailants were ,
persons who were thrown out of positions ;

Kansas Travelers Rnlate Amusing Inci-

American Republic.
WICHITA, Kas., April 9â F. B. Garce
lon, the C'ohvich banker, and John Muhan
of this city have returned from Guatemala,
to which country they went some three or
four months ago. They sailed from New
Orleans for L vingston, Guatemala, end
were five days crossing the gulf, a portion
of which time was occupied in skirting the
Yucatan coast to what is known as the
Yucatan channel to Belize, British Hon
duras.
They describe the town clock at Living
! ston as one of tbe greatest curiosiiies seen
on their trip. It consists of a piece of
railroad iro:> suspended in the air, and
the time of day or nijrnt is struck upon it
by a policeman detailed tor that purpose.
Tbis time-striker uses a bludgeon to make
the iron resound, and what was more
ludicrous still to the travelers was the
fact that tiie time-striker seemed to mark
his hours just whenever he happened to
think of it. For instance, if he should
become engrossed in a same of card* he
might forget all about the "clock" and let
I it "run" an hour and a half between
strikes.
The natives use a long runnintr vine,
wind it around some hoor*. plaster it
I with clay and make a hands >me vessel,
; which is carried upon the beads or women.
j . The travelers brought back many curi
ous siiver coins, ranging in vaiue from 3^a
up to lO^ctnts. Paper money is called
i '"monkey" money and siiver money is
! c.iHed ":in" money by the natives.
I Everybody in that country must pay his
I debts. A man mieht as well be accused
j of murder as dodging a debt.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1897.
GOES TO ARREST
LAWYER MORGAN
Mendocino's Sheriff Leaves
Ukiah in Quest of the
Fugitive.
Bears a Warrant Chareing Him
With the Crime of Felony
Einb zzlement.
The Man Alleged to Have Levied Black
mail on Capitalist Alsip Will
Be Prosecued.
UKIAH, Cal., April 9.â Sheriff J. R.
Jonnson and Deputy J. L. Johnson left this
morning for tbe vicinity of Orrs Hot
Springs to arrest E. M. Morgan, the San
Francisco attorney who is accused of
naving levied blackmail on Capitaliai
Edwin K. Alsio of Sacramento.
It has been known by tho local authori
ties that Morgan was in tbi3 vicinity, as
published in The Call when his where
abouts were first ascertained. At that
time no attempt was made to arrest him,
but last evening a telegram was received
by the Slienff from Captain of Police I.
W. Lees of San Francisco, asking that
Morgan be arrested at once, and stating
further that a warrant for felony embezzle
ment was out for his arrest. It was acting
on these instructions that Sherift John
son and his deputy left to mate the arrest.
Morgan was la*t heard of near Charlei
Perkins* tie camp, some distance north
west of Orrs Hot Springs, and at a point
about thirty miles from Ufciab, where in
one of the most secluded spots in the red
woods he was engaged in erecting a cabin
for himself. He arrived at Orrs Springs
on March 17, and remained therefor some
time under the name of McNamer, it is
suid. Wlicn his whereabouts was ascer
tained by the author. ties he suddenly dis
appeared, but a short time ago he was
agaiu discovered.
CURIOUS INDIAN LEGENDS.
Missionar.es Tell Quaint Slor/es of How
Certain Tribes Account for the
Moon's Changes.
WICHITA, Kans, April 9.â Many
curious Indian legends are being brought
to light by the missionaries who labor
among the various tribes of the Indian
Territory. The natural phenomena.whicb,
on account of their utter ignorance, they
are unable to assign to appropriate cau*eÂ«,
arc made the groundwork of some of the
prettiest and most ingenious legends that
have been evolved in civilization's twi
light, and a wealtn of new material awaits
the labor of those who delight to delve in
legendary lore.
The latest acquisition is the account re
cently given by a Cheyenne Indian chief
of the Indian explanation of the changes
of the moon. Ho said that tne Indians
have from time immemorial believed that
every time a new moon appeared it was
the signal for all the mice in the whole
world to gather themselves together in
one central spot. The meeting took place
at night, and the whole lace of the coun
try was blackened because of the limit
less numbers of the little rodents.
When they assembled four captains were
chosen, ami the captains separated them
into four great armies of equal numbers.
At a given signal each captain led his
urmy a different way. One army went to
the north, another' to the south, a third
to the east and a fourth to the west.
These vast armies of mice trareled until
they reached the point where, from the
place ol starting, "the heavens seemed to
touch the earth. Ihen they climbed up
the sky until they came to the moon,
which by th:s time was what we call full.
All of the four armies then commenced
nibbling at Luna. Slowly but surely the
great hosts nibl'ied away a large portion
of the moon. When at last ttiey had
eaten her all up the mice would scamper
hack down the heavens to the earth and
wait for Luna to show herself again, when
the journey and the nibbling would be re
peated.
This is what the Indiana of early days
believed was the cause of the moon grow
ing old and finally disappearing.
LEADER BAILEY ON PROTECTION.
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 9.â Bailey of Texas, the Demo
cratic leader of the House of Representatives, says so far as his party
is concerned no effort will be made to goad Reed into appointing commit
tees, thus opening the way for general legislation. He said: "Our
position has been that whenever the Republican party legislates the
country suffers. The Republican party has undertaken to demonstrate
to the country that the method of restoring prosperity is to pass a pro
tective tariff law. As the country gave the commission to the Repub
licans last fall to put the remedy into operation, the Democrats feel the
people should have an opportunity to test the matter at the earliest op
portunity. Therefore we favor the speedy passage of the tariff Dill as
the surest means of securing a return to power."

G !den Sequel to tbe Locg and Bitter
Contest in Legislature and
Courts.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. April 9.â After
being successfully piloted past tbe reefs
and through tbe shoals of six stormy ses
sions of the Legislature, only to meet dis
aster at the hands of various Governor? of
the State, the now famous Jordan bill ar
rived safely in port, and this afternoon
the event was celebrated with the musical
chink of $20 cold pieces as State Treasurer
Radcliffe's deputies deftly slid $03,563 60
into canvass receptacles and passed them
over into the grasp of the hungry crowd of
attorneys, who had gathered like buzzards
around a worn-out horse which bad
dropped by the highway, to fight and
quibble over the spoil. The Jordan bill
has boen paid, and never more will its
merits and demerits echo through the
halls of the State Legislature.
The history of ths claim is interesting.
Prior to the passage by tho late Legis
lature of the bill appropriating money to
it, Thomas R. Hnyncs, assignee in the
insolvency case of Dennis Jordan, brought
suit to recover certain amounts alleged to
be due former creditors ana served in
junction papers upon the State Controller
and Treasurer to prevent payment of the
money. After the bill passed State Con
troller Colgan refused to draw the war
rant on account of tbeie injunction pro
ceedings.
On the 2-1 of April Jordan applied for a
writ of mandate in the Superior Court ol
Sacramento County and an alternative
writ was issued lo Controller Colgan com
manding him to draw hla warrant or
show cause on tbe 9th day of April why he
refused. Yesterday another obstacle
cropped up in the form of a suit for $1500,
brought in San Francisco by Abner Doble,
a former creditor, and another restraining
order waÂ« issued and directed to the Con
troller, ccinuiÂ»ndiug him not to dra^ the
warrant in favor of Jordan uatil further
order of the court.
The suit instituted by Haynea against
Jordan was dismissed and the restraining
j order dissolved, so when the man-
I damus proceeding came up in the Supe
j rior Court in this city to-day Jordan's at
torneys insisted thai a 'peremptory writ
i should be issued, because all injunction
j proceedings instituted against tue Con
\ trolier prior to the issuance ot the alterna
tive writ of mandate bad been dissolved.
j Deputy Attorney-General C. N. Post, rep
| resenting the Controller, demurred, con-
I tending that tbe injunction served in the
; suit of Doble vs. Jordan was binding on
the Controller and was a sufficient an
\ swer to Jordan's petition fora peremptory
' writ, which he contended tne Superior
i Court in consequence had no righi to
issue.
A recess was taken and Jordan's attor
neys communicated with San Francisco
and obtained a settlement and dismissal
in the Doble suit. Thereupon a peremp
tory writ of mandate was granted by
Judce Hughes and served upon the Con
troller, and the long and bard ii/ht for
tbe Jordan claim ended with the ls^uinc
oi warrants an<i payment by the State.

Corinthian Taeht Club Apvealt to the
SUirSn County Supervitor:
TIBURON, Cal., April 9.â Among the
petitions presented to the Board of Super
visors of Marin County to-day was one
from the Corinthian Yacht Club, having
its headquarters at this place. The peti
tion, which was presanted over the signa
ture of E. B. Laihrop as secretary, calls
attention to the fact that the drawbridge
"panning the entrance to the lagoon at
Tiburon is badly out of repair, and in a
dangerously weak condition. The board
of directors of the yacht club states in the
petition that it will not be responsible for
any accident resulting from such a condi
tion, and will hold the county of Marin
liable for damages.
The Supervisors to-day appointed George
E. Ring one of the board to take action in
the matter, and the bridge will probably
be strengthened.

THE CITY OF ROSEBURG.
3y A.. C Marster3, Mayor.
ROSEBURG, Ob., April 7.â Roseburg,
the conn y seat of Douglas County, Ore
gon, is situated on the east bank of toe
South Umpqua River, at its confluence
with Deer Creek, six miles above its junc
tion with the North Fork. Rosebnrg is
nettled on a beautiful plateau, eloping
from a succession of tree-covered hills to
the rippling water o! the noisy Umpqua,
which winds its wav west of the city to
'Winchester Bay, some sixty miles distant.
From a business point of view Roseburg
is most advantageously located, occupy
ing a strategic point in the famed and
beautiful Umpqaa Valley, which extend:
from the Calapooia Mountains on the
north to Rogue River Range southward,
and sweeps from tbÂ» anow-cappedCascades
in the east to the shores of the Pacific,
fanned in winter by tbe warm and soft
Chinook winds, and cooled in summer by
balmy tea breezes. It has one cf the most
equable and pleasant climates on the
Pacific Coatt, the thermometer seldom ,
above 80 in summer, and rarely falling
below 60 in winter.
The Dmpqoa Valley, though not so
large as some others, is one ol the most
fertile, possessing a deep, rich alluvia] ;
soil. Until recent years the farmers con- j
tented them elves chiefly in growing grain
.and raining stock; the amount of wool
was exceedingly large for the territory,
and commands "the best price of any pro- ,
duced in the Northwest.
The agricultural pursuits are now being
more diversified, and Irait culture is re
ceiving rr.ncri attention, as the large
plain, peach and pear orchards that ere
la.it coming into bearing give undisputed
testimony. he prune industry, which a
Some of the Stately Structures That Adorn the Streets of Roseburg, Or.
few years since consisted of only a few
acres in the valley, now covers several
thousand acres, the quality in size and
flavor are unexcelled anywhere in the
world, the yield per tree unequaled, and
in a very few years, when the young
prune orchards come fairly into bearing,
the amount produced will be enormous,
and require many hundred* of people to
gather and work the crop.
On thÂ» south and east lie the principal
mineral belts, in which come rich gold
placer mines arc being worked. Many
millions of dollars in gold have been
washed from the rich gravel bars along
the Umpqua River and its tributaries in
the old crude way*, bat the march of im
provement and modern modes are swiftly
superseding and displacing the old. The
last year has witnessed the investment of
neveral hundred thousand dollars in
Improved methods ana the returns to the
promoters have in every instance been
most flattering and have by far exceeded
the most sanguine expectations in many
places, and the success attending has
placed many new companies with large
capital in the mining district.
Scarcely any attention has, until the
past year, been paid to quartz mining or
prospecting; small as has been the pros
pecting in quartz the results have, been
most oatisfactory. Free milling ore of a
very high grade has been developed in
many leads. Some are being thoroughly
prospected, among which is the Black Re
publican, located in the foothill!", eight
miles distant from Roseburg, owned by
Messrs. T. C. Flint, K. Rice and G. W.
Kimball. They began last spring pros
pecting their claim by sinking â¢halts,
wince which time they have run three tun
nels, one of which strikes the main led up
about Â£00 feet below the surface, and ex
poses a well-defined ledge with assays
running very high. They will in the near
future erect a mill to hanrtle the ore.
One small claim adjoining the Black
Republican has just been bonded for
$30,000, and work on it will be prosecuted
with vigor at once. Littlefield ik Day,
with Portland capital, huve purchased the
Olall-t placer mine?, twelve miles from
Roseburg. These mines have been known
to possess untold wealth in coarse gold,
but on recount of a scarcity of water the
former owner was unable to work the
claim except in very wet seasons Trie
Littlefield & Day Company is backed with
abundance of capital and has completed
a ditch of three miles in length and placed
two giants at work, erected a mill and a
number of other buildings, and will at
once extend its ditch about eight miles
farther and tap a large cieek which will
furnish abundance of water.-
Some twenty miles south are located
the lamons nickel Mines, which cover an
area of 2000 acres of hieh-graue ore. Ttiere
is at preÂ»ent aoout $40,000 worth of ma
chinery on the ground, and it is expected
the company will begin active work in
tbo early summer months. The supply
of ore is almost inexhaustible, and sev
eral hundred men will find employment
there. The Victor niir.e and several
others promise renewed activity, feeveral
copper mines are being opened 'ip which
prospect very rich and sive good promise
of bein^: actively worked.
Within a few miles both east and west
of Ro*ebur* fine bodies of coal bayÂ« been
opened, some of which are worked and
hanled to this city by team and nstd for
fuei. The coal is of excellent quality.
Several of these mines are located on the
proposed line of the Roseburg and Coos
Bay Railroad. About one-naif of tne road
U completed and in operation and daily
trains ran between Myrtle Point and
Marthfield, tbs completion of which to
Rosebarg will place it within turee hour*'
run of Coos Jlay, one of :he best harbors

and gJT? it quicK and cheap transporta

The foothills and mountain slopes are
covered with a fine ana extensive growth
of fir, cetfar and sngar pine, a large por
tion of which is Government land and
itill subject to entry. In a few of the
more favorable places mills have been
erected and are at work shipping their
lumber to California points.

Catherine Underwood Asks

Domestic Troubles of Two Oid People
Whose Days on Earth Are
Numbered.
LOS ANGELES, Cau, April 9.âCather
ine Underwood, aimost 70 years of age,
bent in form and leaning upon the arm of
her son, appeared in Judge Allen's court
to-day as plaintiff in a suit for divorce
against William Underwood, who is an
octogenarian. The case was not ready for
trial and it was continued.
The Underwoods were married at Man
chester, N. fl., on October 23, 1865. Four
children ara the fruits of the marriage â
John BL, aged 28; Charles, aged 2S; Kate,
aged 19, and Lizzie, asÂ»ed 18.
I For several years prior to 1887 the Un
i derwoods had not lived happily together.
They had frequent dispute", and it iÂ« said
the defendant wax inclined to be lazy as
well as quarrelsome. On September 20,
1887, he left the family residence and
never returned. Mm i ndenrood claims
the premises she occupie* in the Desnoyer
Tract, in this city, have been bomesteaded
by her.
The defendant will contest the suit. He
states in his crosg-complaiiit that his wife,
for a long time previous to his leaving
the bouse, was in the habit of ill treating
him. She had the habit, he says, of empty
ing slops on biÂ« head, and occasionally
varied her attentions by beating him with
sticks of stovewood and hitting him on
the head with the family shovel. One
night in September, 1887, she locked him
out and he had to seek shelter with a
neighbor. The defendant insists that he
is already divorced from the plaintiff, hav
ing obtained a decree in Washington
County, Ark., in iB6O.
iTnderwood claims that in November,
1883, he iiled a declaration of homestead
on lot 13. block A, Desnoyer Tract, and
that the properly belongs to himself and
Mrs. Underwood. He asks that it be sold
and the proceeds divided between them,
and that the decree be denied to the
plaintiff.
MAY RESENT A SLANDER.
j Judge Weiborn Makes an Important Rul.ng
Regarding the Rights of
he Prvss.
IX)S ANGELEB, Cat... April 9.-After
the opening of the United States Circuit
Court this forenoon, in the case of Rev.
j I. T. Johnson against the Fresno Repub
lican, Judge O^in Weiborn made an ini
| portant ruling on a motion by defendant's
! counsel yesterday for peremptory instruc
tion to tho jury to find for the defendant.
Tbe ground for the motion was that
plaintiffs counsel in their opening state
ment admitted the chief charge of the
newspaper against tbe evangelist, viz.:
that he lihil uttered Irom the pulpit in
Fresno in Mnrch of last year, on informa
tion supplied to him by a man whom be
I refused at the time to name, slanders
i against the young women of Fresno. This
I admission, it whs contended, forever
i barred plaintiff from any IÂ«op3 of obtain
ing a judgment for damages in the prem
ise*, for the reason that the gist o> tae
whole case was covered by the said admis
sion; the plaintiff had made tbe allega
tion imputed to him and in the manner
described in the article complained of.
The denunciation of the alleged slander
was in the nature of a piivilego I publica
tion, and therefore the plaint. ff cou.d uot
recoTer.
Judge WÂ«lborn took all of yesterday
afternoon to consider the matter, read the
coiaplaiut aud the newspaper's articles
and consult authorities. His ruling on
tbia point was in substance that in re
peating a slander, a person was as culpa
b!e a<t the individual wbo originated it,
tnd that its having been spoken from tbe
pulpit rather intensified than relieved the
speaker of his responsibility. The rres9
in the judcm^nt of tbe court, had the
right to publish over again and in its own
way that which wu before published
from the pulpit.
The conclusion is clear that, in Judge
Welbom's opinion, there Is a limit to the
â Bperaions o! private character by preach
ers of the gospel vbicb. if translated.
renders tbe individual subject to crfticum
and arraignment by the public press.
This count in tbe complaint was, there
fore, lor the rest of thÂ« trial rendered nu
gatory by the rulinr, but in a subsequent
count therein, reference was made to
Johnson's hasty departure from Fresno
a::J tbe manner of his eoing; and the
Judge decideJ iaat on this point alone

proceeded.
SACRILEGE ON THE STAGE.
Bishcp Montgomery Denounces Actress
Far.ny Davenport's Fiat " Gis
monda."
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 9.-Fanny
Davenport's "GismoÃda" at the Los Ange
les Theater has been denounced by Bisbop
Montgomery of this city as immoral, de
grading and an insult to the II man
Catholic cbmch. What Bishop Mont
gomery objects to is the alleged sacri
legious way in wbich sacred ceremonies
and officials of the Catbolic church are
made 10 serve as the background and set
ting of "liismonda." In the play are
priests, nuns, a convent end a cathedral,
and in the last act is pictured tue cere
monies of Palm Sunday, -where incense is
burned, palms wavea and masses chanted,
will all the fervor of a bcdy of religious
devotees.
This splendid ceremony is. however,
uÂ«ed only to make the story of Gismonda's
amour stand out in strong contrast, and,
according to IJishop Montgomery, is a
profanation of sacred things, feaid jjiahop
Montgomery to-day:
"I consider it an outrage that such a
play should be presented to the general
public under the guise of dramatic enter
tainment. I have heard of Miss Daven
port's abilities as an actress, and had
credited her with better respect for sacred
things than her acting in this play seems
to indicate she possesses.
"Tne most sacred religious ceremony
that the Catholic Christian knows is that
of Palm Sunday mass. To introduce even
a portion of this into a play like "Gis
monda," which, as I understand ft, reeks
with the lasciviousness of an allesed
Catholic princess, b blasphemy, in my
opinion. Little better than that sort of
thing can be expected of bardou, though.
He seems to delipht in weaving a tale
which will broadly suggest unclean
things, with the Catholic church as a
background for the scenes of his plays."

LOS ANGELES. Cal.. April 9.-Mana
<rer Nevin of the Santa Fe has made a big
find for his company. Quietly for several
weeks he has been boring at Fnllerton in
Orange County for oil on the company's
land. To-day he received a' telegram stat
ing that oil had been struck at a depth of
510 feet. The well is flowing at the rate of
fifty barrels a day. .â¢;-*Â« '.' s-T 'â '-'-'â '
This discovery is expected to be the lore
runner of others, to r . Nevin believes that
an oil belt exists at Fullerton, and that at
least a dozen wells wiil soon be flowing on
the company's land there. If this is a
fact the Santa Fe will probably equip all
of its engines with oil burners. The com
pany recently shifted from oil!, to coal,
when the fluid sold at $1 65 a barrel. With
wells of its own it will be independent of
other producers, and will, it la believed,
dispense with coal entirely. '

ALASKAN WILDS
Pioneer Thorp Will Drive
Cattle to the Yukon
Country.
Has Found a Mountain Pass
That Man and Beast Can
Traverse.
Each Animal Will Sell for Five Hun
dred Dollars in the Circle
City Market.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 9â The rather
novel and somewdat stupendous feat of
delivering a herd of LOO beef cattle at Cir
cle City, on the Yukon, by July 1 is to be
undertaken by Willis TborD, the Alaska
pioneer. Of tbe success of the scheme
Thorp has no misgivings, and in this con
nection be believes he has solved the
problem of quicker and cheaper supply
delivery at tbe famed Yukon digging*
through the medium of packhorses.
From Cbilkat Tnorp found a new pass
through the mountain range oetween the
Yukon and the sea. It is one that can bÂ«s
traveled by man or beast. T*ie discovery
was made last year through the kindly
offices of an old Indian guide.
Thorp took in thirty-eve head of cattle
last season and, while the undertaking
was successful from a financial standpoint,
it was. nevertheless, a hazardous one.
After crossing the mountain range the
cattle had to be placed on rafts and taken
down a chain of lakes. This time they
will travel by land from the ocean to the
Yukon, which will be reached first at a
point below Five Fingers. There the cat
tle will be rafted down the river to Circle
City.
Those cattle heretofore taken by Thorp
to Circle City brought $.500 each, a profit of
$'iOO a head. They sold for 50 cents a
pound undressed.
Thorp has already begun the purchase
of his cattie and he expects to ship them
from Seattle on May 15.

complete an irrigation system that shall
not be excelled anywhere in t^ie wor.d.
To effect tiiis the Arrowhead Reservoir
Company was organized some years ago
and the hand of capital has slowiy but
aurely supplemented nature in transform
ing the mountain wilds into mighty
basins for the impounding of water. Tne
company is composed of Cincinaati cap
italists. Whi!Â« they are a corporation
they have issued no bonds and contract
no indebtedness.
To ascertain tne exact precipitation in
the region covered by tne watersheds the
company years ago established twenty-six
stations, wnere every rainfall and every
snowstorm is nofed and measured. Each
reservoir will be cleared of all vegetable
growth in oriier that the water may be
suitable for domestic use as well as for
irrigating purposes. Tne main part of
the work so far has been the driving of
tunnels from tne first to the second and
from the second to the third reservoir.
The tunnels go through solid roes ai.d
are large and perfect in their construc
tion.
All the watersheds and reservoir? are
on the farther side of the mountains, and,
of course, the water is wanted on this
side. A system of tunnels and canyons
condncts ice water tbrosgu the mountain!!
to the San Bernardino side. The point
where the water debouches from the
mountain is at a great elevation above
the valley. Here a mighty force will
generate electricity and supply power for
manufacturing an<i other purposes. The
water will be conveyed in ditches, flumes
and pipes to all parts of the valley and
even ax far as Pomona, Pasadena and Los
Angeles
During the present season the company
wiil enier upon the work of building the
dams and by tne year 1808 will doubtless
have completed the most perfect reservoir
system for irrigation in California.
LATE TRAINS FROM MAR IN.
President J. B. Stetson of the Nor.h Facfic
Coast Railroad Meets a Popu
lar Demand.
MILL VALLEY, Cal, April 9.â The
petitions extensively signed in various
towns in Marin County, notably Sansa
lito, Lark3pur, San Rafael and Mill Val
ley, have had their effect, and President
J. B. Stetson of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad has decided to yield to the popu
lar demand and give tne people on the
line of liis road an after-dianer train,
leaving San Raiael and Mill Valley in the
neighborhood of 10 o'ciocfc in the evening.
Foliowinp this announcement comes the
I information that the scenic road running
I between Mill Valley and tne summit of
Mount Tamalpais will run an evening
trem to connect with the after-dinner
â  train on the North Pacific Coast road.
This will afford tlie toun=t an opportunity
of seeing liÂ»e snn set and moon'nse from
the topmo?t point of Tamalpass without
having to spend the night onthe summit.
The now time table, with its important i
changes, will go into effect the 25: h of this ;
month. The theater trips, ,'caving San !
Francisco at 11:30 Monday, Wednesday!
and Saturday nights, will be continued i
without cbanee.
The reÂ«idiÂ»ntÃ of Marin County bave
never before been given a trip leaving
their side ior the metropolis late in the
evening and tne North Pacific Coast road
will attempt the experiment this month
for the tir^t time. Toe petitions ajkinjj
for the !ate train, after being largely
signed, were presented to the president of
the Nortfc Pacific Coast road by tne prom
inent men of the various towns in person.

BECAUSE OF THE LATE
CENTURY.
They Expect an Adverse Deci
sion on Their Pro
test
THE BAY CITY CYCLISTS NOT
ALARMED.
The Board of Governors to Take Up
k Both Sides of the Row This
Evening.
The bike-racers of the Olympic Club
have declared themselves.
True, the protest they filed with The
racing board against awarding the Varney
cup to the Bay City Wheelmenâ the vic
tors in tbe recent annual century relay â
Is now entirely in the hands of tbe local
cycling authorities for adjudication, and
the trophy will go with their decision;
but the Olympic men say the row is not
going to stop there. They seem to antici
pate that the high moguls will, after
gently reprimanding the Bay City con
tingent for having exhibited in the race a
penchant for being a little tricky, finally
decide that that organization may retain
the cup and the championship. The
Oiympics express themselves as being even
a little doubtful about the reprimand.
It is on account of this feeling that
judgment will go against the protest that
ihe Olympic riders have determined upon
s new ultimatum. This is going to be to
the effect that if nnotlier relay takes place
next year every Olympic Club r.der will
be paced throughout the course, even
though the rules say this shall not be.
Tandems and triplets and even quads will
be used on every ten-mile stretch for the
purpose of sending the packet- bearer
through in record-breaking time, they
announce, and tney will defy the racing
authorities to stop them.
"We have engaged in just enough of
these relays to rind out that we have been
foolish in essaying to live up to the rules,"
said Frank Fuller, one of the leading
lights of the Olymt>ic Wheelmen, while
discussing the rumpus yesterday. "We
have always gone into these affairs to
/abide by t c regulations and determined
it i race strictly fair and square. But
yhere has been scarcely a time when some
other clvb â and I will be plain and say
i bat it was invariably the Bay City Wheel
men â did not resort to tricks and viola
tions ot the rules in order to win. We be
lieye that we have lost by being too fair,
and this was particularly the case in last
Sunday's race."
"The Olympic Wheelmen arenotsquea!
ing becau>e they didn't get tbe cup, but
are protesting because they do not con
sider they were beaten on the eqoar*.
They are positive that they have the best
team, and to prove it are willing to go
against the tfav City team any time in a
special race. I don't believe, however,
that we could drag them into another con
test. In a nutshell, our position is this:
If tricky racing is to be tolerated we are
not going to be placed in the position of
protesting and sauawking all tbe time,
but are going to resort to tricks ourselves.
It's a game that more than one club can
rlav at successfully. It's bad for tbe
sport, we wili admit, but we propose to
look out for our colors."
The Olympics' protest will in all
probability come up for a bearing
this evening at the meeting of the
board of governors of the Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs. The document is at
present in the hands of Chairman Adams
of the road-racing committee, but he will
doubtless present it to the board. There
has been some discussion as to whether
the committee or the governors should de
cide the vexatious question, but the wheel
men generally concede that tbe matter
properly belongs in the hands of the board.
The Olympic lads have practically de
cided not to lay Â«o much stress upon their
complaint regarding the conduct of the
Bay City men in the last relay â that is,
the alleged pacing of Kenna and tbe in
terference indulged in for his protection.
They assert that they have a better case
against the Bay Citvs in connection with
the ninth relay, allesing that they have
abundant proof that Krafts was paced for
J several miles by Vincent. This alleged
1 violation will constitute the real ground
for their request that the Bay City Wheel
men be not awarded the cup.
Lew Hunter, ex-c airman of the road
rac'ng committee and one of the foremost
members ol the Olympic Club, said yes
terday that if the Bay City men entered a
counter-protest to the effect that tbe
Olympics hail riders in the race who were
jiot bona-fide members they would find a
Bimilar charge placed against themselves.
The Bay City boys continue to make
light of the whole affair, and profess to
have no fear ns to the result They refrr
to the discontented Olympians as "sore
hends" and "squealer-," and say they can
easily disprove all of the charges ot un
fairness and trickery when they appear
before the governors.
WORK ON THE BALBOA.
Over Fourteen Thousand Cubic
Yards of Sand and Dirt
Moved.
Whrn the people who have so cheer
fully contributed 10 th- unemployed and
those who will in the near future do like
wise consider that over 1300 men have
been benefited they undoubtedly will feel
that the money given has been put to a
good use.
Up to the present time 1500 labor tickets
have been issued from the committee's
cilice, but about 200 of those receiving
tickets have not r- ported for work.
I A visit to the scene of operation will
I satisfy all that eood work has been done,
a grand driveway is now assuming
. iii'-vani shape.
The work of filling in the hujre hollow,
wUich requires 14 000 cubic yards of earth
to brinp ii up to grade, is no small task lit
itself. This, with the construction of a
culvert-bridge requiring tne use of heavy
timber.", somewhat retards the road wore
Bnt thii is neceiÂ«ary. as the flow of water
through this culvert in the winter season
is considerable, and without the bridge
would overflow the entire section.
The earth necessary to fill in this hollow
must, as a mutter of course, be hauled
from the adjacent heights, a portion of
which lies on a line with the boulevard.
To do this gravity-cars, horse teams and
wheelbarrows are used.
To carry on this work money is needed.
The relief committee is doing all that is in
its power to irmease the fund. thus pre
venting a cessation of the boulevard work,
and likewise the help and relief of the
hundreds of the unemployed.
. Up to the present the wheelmen bave
remained in a qiiescent condition, and
for some reason, presumably lack of ap
preciation, there nas been but a small
amount contributed by the wheelmen. The
request for aid from the wheelmen ap
plies not only to the members of clubs,
but to every person who rides, whether
man, woman or child. If every ri-aer in
this City would contribute just $1 each
there would be no further need of funds
The boulevard could more than be com
ploted with the amount.
It is expected, that the lecture to be
given by Henry A. Butters, a graduate of
the State University and recently of South
Africa, to-night, at Y. M. C. A. Hall on
Mason street, will swell the receipts con
siderably. Mr. Butters will speak on
South Africa, its physical resources and
opportunities. This will be a lecture well
worth hearing, as the speaker is a talented
orator.
After this follows the boxing and ath
letic tournament to be given by the Man
hattan Club at Woodward's Pavilion on
the evening of April 18.
The rehearsals are taking place regu
larly for the cantata. ".Ruth and Naomi,"
to be presented at the California Theater,
April 21. A number of prominent citi
zens have subscribed for boxes, and alto
gether the encouragement given the work
of the children would indicate that the
performance will be a big success.

within the last few years saia district has be

T. H. LAURIER AND B. F. PEABODY, Who Have Come Up
From the Madera Strike
[Sketched from life bg a "Calf' artist.}
THE FINDING
OF THE LOUISE
Excitement Over the New
Gold Strike in the
Madera Foothills.
Mrs. Wagner Said to Have Day
After Day Picked $250 in
Nuggets From Quartz
Shaw Brothers Buy tLe Mine Cheaply
Because of a Bondâ Tbe Country
All Staked Cff.
T. H. Laurier and B. F. Peabody of the
widely talke<i-of Louise mine, the latest
gold strike in Madera County, seven
miles northwest of Raymond, are at the
RU3S. They are the first arrivals from the
new bonanza and give a remarkable story
of the discovery of the mine, its richness
in gold and the general interest in the
district.
Mr. Laurier is the stepson of Joseph
Wagner, the owner, or who was, till
Thursday, the owner, for on that day
Archibald and Millard Soaw, who own a
reneral store at Raymond, paid ov-r $11,
--OGO on a bond taken three weeks before
ihe strike and thus became .owners of the
property. Both Laurier and Peabody
vrpre working in the mine when the strike
was made. They say the mine is cer
tainly a wonder ami tiiat Mr. Wagner is
sorry he ever gavt- the bond.
"But he got about $70,003 out of it in
all," said Mr. Peabody. "After be struck
it the gold was so easily got that about
$10,010 was rea:ized before the property
had to be turned over. Tbe rock is lit
erally peppered with gold, and after a
shot is firo'd it ia so thick wth pieces of
gold and nuggots that it i* like pumice
stone. 1 have seen Mrs. Wagner sit on
the dump day after day and pick out the
gold, securing $250 a day just in that
way.
"The ore is worked with a single arastra
and by panning. The whole force con
sisted of but four men. Mr. Wagner is a
farmer, and owns a lot of land around
there. I estimate tnat the mine is worth
at least $50,000 without any development.
"When we were cleaning up there was
some loose gold about the arastra, and
Mr. Wagner pave it to bis stepson and
me, and we brought it up in this can and
tjottle. 1 reckon there is $300 or $400 of it.
We wili tafcÂ«Â» it over to the Mint to-mor
row. The $10,000 that I allude to besides
this was taken out by two men in about
two weeks. Tne gold is free milling."
"The strike was made," said Mr.
Laurie r, "by a thirty-five foot shaft. Tae
vein is about three feet and a half thick,
lying between well-defined walls. The
banging wall is a very bard granite, or a
granite with an appearance of being
mixed with some other rock. The foot
wall is pretty near the same, except that
it is a little lighter in color, and there is
one place to the left on the foot wall where
there is a kind of white slate.
"Tne vein is composed of red and white
quartz, largely decomposed, and there is
j_'oi<i in both kinds. In fact, gold appears
all the way through with sin ular plenti
:nines?. It is the richest mine I ever Â«aw.
It is really astonishing the amount of the
yellow m*tal there is in the quar,z.
"Great excitement was caused by the
discovery, tuough it ha- subsided a little
now, but the country is all stated off for
miles around. However, no monu
ments are up and no wont has been done.
There is no other pay mine in the vicinity
except one that is reported to be good and
which has been closed down for a long
time because of inability on the part of
the owners to agree. Grub Gulch, thoagh,
is not far away and several properties are
working there.
'â¢The mine is about a mile and a half
from the Fresno River, on the road to
Fresno Flats. It is situated neither on
thu plains nor in the mountains, but in
the foothills. The hills there are rounded,
and in summer dry and brown, but dotted
here and there with liveoaks, so that the
country is quite attractive, especially
when the gra&s is green.
"The bond was originally given to a
man named Mitchell, and he transferred
it to the Shaw brothers for $1000 extra.
The whole of the purchase price was paid
over for the mine in Madera yesterday.
Hed it not bet,n bonded before the strike
oi course we wtoulda't have sold for such a
sum.
"I understand the new owners will
work the mine for the present with a
whim from the top and by a tunnel.
There was a 200-foot tunnel on the prop
erty years ago, which found a good pros
pect of gold, but it was allowed to cave in.
The dirÂ«ct route to t:ie mine is from here
t.> Barenda, thence by rail thirty miles to
Raymond, and then by ordinary convey
ance seven miles to the northeast. We
will be here for several days."
This is the first definite news which has
rpached here since the discovery was set
torth by telegraph. In the dispatches,
however, none of the essential details,
such as men informed about mines, as
well as the general reader, want to know.

Tried to Find the Pea.
Neil Knudson has caused the arrest of
William Leonard on a charge of grand
larceny.
Knudson is a stranger here, and be is
as foreign to the wiles of bunko men as
other? are to tiie danger of putting out
gas by blowing.
He saunterei along Kearny street on
Wednesday afternoon, when Leonard, a
clever man in his iine, addressed him.
They became friendly and a drink or two
cemented the bond.
Leonard introduced Knudson to others,
and they played DOker.
Knudson, who knows the value of a
poker band, bet as high as $110 on an ace
lull, one of Leonard's friends raking down
ti.e pot with four fours.
Leonard agreed with Knudson that
they should quit playing fora wnile, and
Doth started to pay a visit to the Presidio.
At the latter place they found a man
who was reckless with his money. He
cad three walnut shells and a tiny little
rubber ball ha called the "joker."
It was apparent to Knudson that the
man was reckless in his wageri, and be
invested $140 more to tind nut that the
suellman was exceedinely lucky.
Just at this time a policeman in citizen s
clothes broke in upon the crowd and all
were plared under jirrest.
The officer said that thoy must go to
prison and that each would have to pay
a tine of $500.
Leonard suggested that Knudson buy
the officer off wit:i a good-sized banknote,
but as the victim was already robbed of
all his possessions Leonard generously
tendered $50 of his own money, and the
policeman went away.
It is unnecessary to say that the bogus
policeman, Leonard and a couple of other
bunko men robbed Knudson. who was re
gretful for his experience, but who was
willing to let the matter drop.

STRUGGLING FOR
DAVIS' DOLLARS
Lizzie Muir and Belle Cur
tis Fight for Their
Legacies.
Contestants Allege That the
Name of the Decedent Was
Dsdiker, Not Davis.
Rjv. Joseph P. Wilson and Mrs-
Catherine Steal Demani Pos
session of a Cool Million.
Further sensations are promised soon
in the estate of Jacob Z. Davis, deceased,
which is to be called for ihe hearing cf the
will contest on the 26ih m-t.
Great surprise was caused several
months ago, when it was learned for the
tirst time that the decedent's true name
was Dediker and not Davis. Under the
name of Davis be had lived in California
for nearly half a century us a prominent
business man, had amassed a fortune of
about a million dollars, had been known
from one end of the State to the other and
yet nobody in his wide circle of acquaint
ances here ever suspected that his pat
ronymic was anything but Davis. It is
right to observe that ne bore the name
worthily and was at all times recognized
as a worthy citizen.
Several months ago Dayis died in an
Eastern city, aud shortly afterward tbe
following instrument was filed as his
last will and testament, with a demand
that it be admitted to probate :
October 1, 1896.
I, Jacob Z. Davis, will and bequeath every
thing I have in this world to my beloved
uieces, Lizzie Muir and Belle Curtis.
Jacob Z. Davis.
Ihi mediately steps were taken for the
purpose of putting Mrs. Muir and Mrs.
Curtis in possession of the property, neces
sary papers to that end being filed by
Mastick & Mastick, the ladies' attorneys.
Within a few days Knight & Hegeerty
presented a contest on the part of Rev.
Joseph 1". Wilson and Mrs. Catherine
Stead, who diclared that the deceased,
DÂ»vis, alias Dediker, was their ui:cle â the
brother of their mother, now dead.
An attack was made on the allegea will,
as the lawyers say, "all along the line."
Ie was charged that said Davis, alias
Dediker, never wrote the will, ana that,
consequently, it must be rejected as a
spurious and fabricated document. Never
theless if it should be found tt.at be
actually penned the words presented as a
holographic will in the form here seen,
then they allege that lie did so because ha
was under the control and influence of
persons to them unknown, who induced
the decedent to believe that the contest
ants had no affection for him, that they
had spoken ill of him, th?t they were un
worthy of his bounty and that they were
eager for his death in order that they
mipht get possession of his wealth. The
inference is also given that the legatees
under the will are no kin to the de
ceit nt.
Mrs. Muir and Mrs. Curtis made an
swer to the accusations of the contest
ants, saying tnat there was no truth in
the statement* touching the fabrication
of the will, and that as a matter of fact ii
was written, dated and Â»igned by the tes
tator while in sound and dupoMing mind
and lree from all undue influence and
duress, as had been alleged by the con
testants.
Notwithstanding their denials the con
testants will attempt to prove their
charges before a jury when the case comes
to trial.
In the meantime a new claimant has
made bis appearance, William F. Emer
son of Cincinnati has wiitten thi follow
ing tetter in regard to the estate:
At my mother, Mrs. Margaret Z. Emerson,
was first cousin to Jacob Z. Davis (Uedlker).
her fattier and bis mother being brother and
sister, I with to find out if possible whether,
if the trill is broken, we would come in lor
mother's share, sue being a close blood rela
tive. Cousin Jacob has always promised

the hands of my uncle, John Austin of Balti
mor.) will give all lnlormatiou as to relation

Balfour's assertion of a possible alii

Great Northern to open a market in

It is said to be the intention of the Sen
ate Committee on Finance to report the
tariff bill to the Senate on May 1, but if
obstacles are interposed the report may
not be made until June 1. In the meSÂ»i
time the House will have to ask itself
what it. would rather do or go fishing.
Senator Morgan's resolutions in favorof
Cuban independence do not seem to have
much effect on the Senate, but they keep
Spain informed of the fact that Cuba has
friends in this country who are watching

and to that extent they serve a good pur
pose and save the patriots from many an
outrage.
The executive committee appointed by
the Indianapolis monetary conference has
begun an agitation to induce Congress to
take up the reforms proposed by the con
ference and proceed to carry them out.
This movement is not unexpected. The
currency question cannot be sidetracked,
and the sooner the administration sets up
steam and goes ahead on it the better the
people will be satisfied.
It is gratifying to learn that tbe experi
ment with free rural postal delivery at
Campbell district in Santa Clara County
has proven satisfactory after two months'
trial. The volume of business of the
cilice steadily increases and the people
show an appreciation of tbe convenience
afforded them. The Campbell district,
being made up of small orchards, is ex
ceptionally well fitted for auch a service,
but there can be little question that the
tystem may be profitably extended to
many oilier districts in the S'.ate, and
since tbe result of the first experiment is
so good the extension may be looked for
at an early date.
THE SILVER QUESTION.
The prompt action taken by the House in enacting a tariff bill designed to pro
vide revenues for the Government and protection to the industries of the American
people gives encouragement to Republicans, and confirms them in the belief that the
administration will be prompt to fulfill every pledge made to the country during the
campaign.
Ii will be well for the administration, however, not to rest content with what has
been accomplished, but to go forward with other things. Tlia tariff was not the only
issue in the campaignâ protection is not the only pledge that was made to the people.
T ere was an emphatic promise made that the McKinley administration would take
immediate iteps to bring about an international agreement for the remonetization of
silver. The people await with impatience for some signs that this pledge also is to be
faithfully fulfilled.
The House nas passed the tariff bill, and is now doing nothing. It has therefore
opportunity to begin at once the work of preparing the way for financial legislation.
It is not expected that the Senate Finance Committee will report the tariff before
May 1. If obstacles intervene the bill may not be reported before June L At least a
month will be required after the report is made before the siow-moviajr Senate can be
expected to take the final vote on the measure. What will the House be doing
d urine all that time? Can it afford to meet only to adjourn, aud be idle while any
pledge of the party remain * unfulfilled?
It is not good politics â it is not wise statesmanship â for the administration to
ignore, or even postpone, the money question. That issue was the most important
one in the last campaign. It overshadowed even the question of protection. It was
discussed on every itumD and in every newspaper throusbout the land.
The Republican party won its victory because its platform, its candidates for office
its speakers on the stump and its representatives among the newspapers empnati
caliy pledged it to take immediate and resolute action toward the establishment of
international bimetallism. The party could not have won otherwise. The people
were thinking of money, they were talking of money. Throughout the country the
main issue was whether wo should have the remonctization of silver by the United
States alone, as promised by the liryanites. or the remonetization of silver by inter
national agreement, as promised by the Republican party. On that issue the great
batte was won, and by what it does on that issue will the McKinley administration
be judged when its work is submitted to the people for approval or condemnation
in the Congressional elections of 1898.
President McKinley owes it to his party and to the country to call to the attention
of Congress the importance of taking action at once on this issue as well as on that
of the tariff. If the question is postponed until the meetine of the regular session
in December it will be late in the winter, or perhaps even in the spring, before so much
as the preliminary steps can be tafcen toward the solution of the problem. The time
will then Le near at hand for the Congressional campaign, and the Republican party
will co into the held hampered by the fact that it has apparently neglected the
paramount issue of the time.
Delay on this issue wou'd be a political blunder of the first magnitude. The
administration should not make it. Congress should be set to work. The call for an
international conference to bring about the rcoionetization of silver should be made
immediately.
THE PEDEBAL BUILDING.
While the Senate is engaged in revising
the tariff the House of Representatives
meets once in three days and then pro
ceeds to adjourn for another three days,
that being the longest time for which it
can adjourn without the consent of the
Senate. The members of tne House,
therefore, have ample time to go fishing,
or to attend to the business of their con
stituents.
The California members ought not to go
fishing. They ought to camp around the
office of the Treasury Department anu that
of the supervising architect and continu
ally remind those officials that there is in
San Francisco a good site for a new Fed
eral building and in the treasury at Wash
ington money to pay for it. Tney can
further inform them that many indus
trious men are out of employment in San
Francisco, that the business of the Na
tional Government requires this new offices
which would be afforded by the building,
and that the need for an early beginning
of the work ot construction is therefore
doubly urgent.
Ail this will be an old story to the Gov
ernment officials, even as it is an old story
to the people of San Francisco. Never
theless it is a story which must be iter
ated and reiterated until action is taken
and the work of construction begun.
Agitation must be insistent and persistent
on this topic. We have tried the experi
ment of waiting in silence Jor many years,
ana tor our pains in the practice of that
policy we have gained nothing except tne
good which comes from the exercise of
patience.
In order to capture Richmond Lincoln
advised General Grant "to keep pegging
away at it." A similar policy is the one
which we roust adopt in our contest for
the new Federal building, and now that
our members of the House of Representa
tives have nothing elle to do it is a good
time for them to keep pegging away at
the Treasury Department until it surren
ders. We must have the binding. We
ought to see work begun on it this summer.
WHEAT fOR THE ORIENT.
Tne letter of James J. Hill, president
of the Great Northern Kailroad, pointing
out the possibility of developing a large
grain trade between the Paciiic Coast and
the Orient, is one which will De read with
no little interest by the people of Califor
nia. It promises benefits both to the mer
cantile and to the farming industries of
the coast and opens up a field of enter
prise well worthy the most serious consid
eration that can be given to it.
According to Mr. Hill, it is possible
for the whuat producers of tbe Pacific
Coast to Dnd a market for their products
in the Orient not only sufficiently large to
consume ali of the current output of
wheat, but to furnish â  demand for it
which would enable us to largely increase
the supply without any diminution of
price. In the province of Amoy, China,
there are 8t\ 000,003 of people, and if these
consume an average of twenty pounds of
flour per capita yearly, they would make
a market for 40,000,000 bushels of wheat
in that province alone. Other districts of
China near the sea and accessible to ships
would make additional markets for an
equally Jarge amount. It seems, more
over, that we have only :o supply the
wheat at reasonable rates in order to In
crease the Chinese use of it, and therefore
tne outlook for an abundant market for
our wheat helds is most excellent.
In the pabt year we hare shipped a good
deal of wheat to China and Japan, and
the result has been to reduce the amount
going to Europe, so that there has been a
rise in tne price. Mr. Hill states that the
price of wheat this year as compared with
last is from 20 to 25 cents higher, and he
tuinks that from 15 to IS cents of this rise
is clearly due to withdrawals of Pacific
wheat from the European markets. The
necessary conclusion is, therefore, that if
we could find in the Orient a market for
all our wheat, there would be better prices,
not only for the Pacific Coast crops, but
tor those of tbe East, and the whole farm
ing population of America would be bene
fited.
To accomplish the opening of this
enormous market for onr wheat products
it is certainly worth while paying a good
price. In bis letter Mr. Hill suggests that
the new tariff should be arranged in such
a manner as to promote the Oriental
trade. If this means that we are to open
tbe Pacific Coast market* to the cheaply
manufactured goods of China and Japan
it might be found within tt few years that
we are paying too bi;h a price for the
new wheat market. In the present con
dition of our industrial development we
need more factories rather than more
wheat fields, and it would not benefit us
mach to sell wheat to the Orient if we had
to sacrifice our manufacturing industries
to do it. Mr. Hill's proposition is worth
considering, but is not to be adopted too
hastily.
;THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1897.
ARMOR PLATE.
The bids for supplying the Government
with 8000 ions of armor plate under the
law stipulating that the average cost
â hould not be more than $300 a ton have
reduced the problem to :he simple one
of a Government plant for the construc
tion of armor plate or the payment by the
Government of excessively large sums to
private parties.
The cost of armor plate was thoroughly
investigated by a commission which re
ported to Congress that it would be
profitable to the manufacturers to furnish
plato to tne Government for a cost not
exceeding $300 a ton. The manufacturers,
however, have evidently determined not
to furnish it for that amount. Only one
of them niaiie any bid at all on the plate
now required for the battle-ships Ala
bama, Illinois and Wisconsin, and this
one while making two rroposiiions did
not conform in either of them to the re
quirements of the law.
One proposition made by the bidder,
the Illinois Steel Company, was an offer
to furnish plates at $240 a ton, on condi
tion that Congress would award it tne
contract for all the armor-plate that would
be wanted by the United States Govern
ment for twenty years, provided that it
should not be required to manufacture
less than 6000 tons nor more than 12.000
tons annually. The other proposition
was that the Government shoul 1 erect an
armor-plate plant and ltase it to the
Illinois Steel Company at a nominal
figure for ninety-nine years, on which
terms the company would agree to manu
facture the armor-plate at a reasonable
cost.
It is conceded that the construction of a
plant for the manufacture of armor-plate
is costly and entails a very heavy ex
penditure of money. As the demand for
such material is limited the profits on
what is made must be very large la order
to pay interest on the capital invested.
These facts were taken into consideration
by the commission which reported that
the plate could be made in this country
at a cost not exceeding $300 a ton. bince
none of the manufacturers are willing to
mate it for that price the Government
should erect two plants of its own, one on
the Atlantic and the other on the Pacific
coast. It would then be independent of
the steel companies and could certainly
manufacture its plate as cheaply as it has
been offered by private bidders at any time
since the construction of the new navy
began.

MRS. CRAVEN WINS
HER MAIN POINT
Will Obtain a Trial on the
19 th of This
Month.
It Is Not Thought Probable That
Further De ay Can Be
Secured.
D. M. D Imas Presented a Strong
Array of Authorities Against
Miss Fair's Intervention.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven's desire for a
speedy trial of the case brought against
her by the managers of the Fair estate
was again made manifest in Judge
Slack's court yesterday. D. M. Dei mas,
of the law firm of Delmas & Shortndge,
representing Mrs.' Craven, reiterated his
strenuous objections to any modification
of the record thnt might permit or give
excuse for further delay.
With this aim in view he took up the
argument on the demurrer to the com
plaint in intervention recently filed by
Miss Virginia Fair, daughter of the late
James G. Fair, in the litigation instituted
by J. S. Angus and other iegal representa
tives of the Fair estate against Mrs.
Craven.
Mrs. Craven's wish, as expressed by
Mr. Delma?, is for an ear y hearing and
determination of the allegation of forgery
made by the other side in regard to her
deeds to certain real estate. She protests
that they are genuine and regular in
every respect, and for a long time she has
been clamoring for a trial on that issue,
announcing that she is eager to have her
documents put to the test and solemnly
asserting that by these she is willing to
stand or fall.
Just as she supposed that she was about
to reach a trial of the case and the jurors
ior determining the question were actually
in attendance and answered to their
names for that purpose an attempt was
made by the opposition to change the
Btatus of the proceedings in such a way
that the case would be changed to pro
ceedings in chancery, and she would be
deprived of her constitutional right of a
trial by jury.
Against this modification of the record,
with its attendant dental of his client's
leeal rights, Mr. Delmas presented an
elaborate array of authorities in support
of his v eir ol the case.
Mr. L> -iiiias insisted that under the law
Ju'lge Slack, sitting as Chancellor, may
not enter. am this equitable delense as it
is presented by Miss Fair.
The foundation of an action in chan
cery lies in the allegation of the orator
that there exists no speedy or adequate
remedy at law. The moment the Chan
cellor learns that an action atlaw is pend
ing, wherein the 9anie facts are :>et up, the
Chancellor says to the person : "Your alle
gation in regard to an equitable deieuse
is untrue and, therefore, my jurisdiction
in chancery vanishes."
Mr. Delmas insisted that under the
original condition of the pleadings tbe
representatives of the Fair estate bad am
ple opportunity for relief; that all they
had to do was to prove the deeds forgeries
and the jury would give a verdict for the
01:107 side, and that would end the case
forever. Judgment on .hat verdict would
give the other claimants as absolute relief
as if the deed^ had been ordered delivered
up and consumed to ashes. 'Why then
this appeal to chancery?" asited the
speaker, and be replied thai there was
nothing in it; that "you cannot appeal to
chancery ; you cannot transfer the former;
you cannot deprive the litigant of bis
rignt of trial by jury wnen the action at
law will be just as efficacious as in chan
cery." In conclusion Mr. DelmaÃ said
that until a case can be found or a deci
sion can be cited to the contrary ne would
respectfully submit that his argument has
not been answered.
Judge Slack remarked thr.t he had noth
ing to add to hrs former decision. He
overrule I the demurrers interposed by
Delmas & Shortridge and allowed one day
in which to answer.
Mr. Delmas replied that the answer
would be filed within an hour, in order
tbat the proceedings might not be de
layed. It had been remarked in some
quarters that be and his associates had
sought for delay. This was untrue. In
reply to the court's suggestion that an
appeal might be taken from the present
ruling Mi. D?lruas said that such appeals
might indefinitely put off the trial. He
recalled the fate of the Blytbe case that
was begun in 1884 and Is now just reach
ing the threshold of ihe United States Su
preme Court. He did not like the pros
pect.
It was agreed tbat on the 12th inst. ar
gument shall be heard in regard to calling
a jury to assist the Chancellor as to spe
cial findines of fact, and that the trial of
the case shall beein on the 19th inst. â

BOWDOIN MOVES A POINT
The Merritt Millions in the
Federal Supreme
Court.
A Motion to Dismiss the Merritt
Heirs' Appe.il Will Bi Argued
in May.
There is a big legal battle on over the
BowdoinColleee case,wherein the nephews
of the late Millionaire Merritt of Oakland.
are struggling hard to get a good share of
the property.
The contest has been on for some years
in the United States Circuit Court, and is
now on nppeai to the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals. Attorneys and
stenographers are busy preparing the
record, which is voluminous already.
Colonel Costigan, clerk of the Circuit
Court, took an inventory of the data in
the erse yesterday and found they made
wheelbarrow loads. Stenographers are
still busy, and by the time the recoris
are complete Janitor T. B. Morton of the
Appraisers' building wiil have a ta>k in
removing them to the precincts presided
over by Clerk Moncton of the Court of
Appeals.
"We have been served with a notice
that an attempt will be made to have our
appeal dismissed on technical grounds,"
said Attorney Horace Philbrook yester
day.
The entire matter will be argued before
the Supreme Court of the United Staieson
M>y 3. The contention is that Judge Me-
Kenna did not sign the certificate of ap
peal within the ti me prescribed bylaw,
and that the omission is of so grave a
character as to nullify all the procee lings.
If the Supreme Court takes the position
assumed by Attorney Hayne the case will
remain as it has already been decided.

The war in Tahiti it over. A3 told ex
clusively in The Call, the natives in
Raiatea and Hanheine and other islands
rose in rebellion and Queen Mamie led
her warriors to the contest. The French
were fought to a standstill time and again,
but in spite of all repulses they gained
ground steadily and finally suDdued the
natives. The Queen was captured, and is
now a prisoner in New Caledonia.
Those who accompanied the Queen into
exile were Te Kaupo, his cUef lieutenant
and sir others. Two hundred and fifty of
the combatants who were not sent into
exile were set to work building crossroads
leaaing into the hills and otherwise mak
ing preparations for the handy working of
the troops in the event of another oat

new road, and the soldiers expect to be
able to subdue the next insurrection inside
of a week.
The schooner Maweema, bound to Yladi

Main-street wharf. "While loading some
of her flour cargo got wet and Hawiey

When this was put in the hold the insur
ance men discovered that the vessel was
overloaded. Then an attempt was made
to unload the salt beef, and a couple of
barrels burst aud ruined the entire con
signment oi flour. Ail of yesterday John
Wliitney, the stevedore, was busy resa. k
ing the flour and restowing the big
schooner, in order to satisfy Gutte <fc
Frank, the insurance agents, who have
the risk on the vpssel and cargo. Cap
tains Metcalf and Waison are looking after
the work of resiowing, and it is safe to say
that when the Maweema sails for V.adivo
stock next, week >he will be a safe risk.

AFTER GUNST'S SCALP.
The Labor Council Cairns He

Japan*
At last nieht's session of the San Fran

which had been sent to the Los Angeles
council by Police Commissioner Gunst, in
which he denied that he handles tene
ment-made goods. The local council
claims to have in its posses ion proofs
that Kerbs, Wenheim & Schiffer, whose
goods are handled by Gunst, are em
ployers of tenement labor. Accordingly
the secretary *as instructed to send to
the Los Angeles council fulier informa
tion on the subject, gleaned by the Cigar
makers' Union.
The minutes of the Los Angeles council
also contained the statement that a com
mittee of three had been appointed to wait
on John Hanlon, contractor : on the Gov
ernment buildintr, and endeavor to in
duce him to withhold all orders for struct
ural iron from the Union Iron Work?,
wb.ch is the lowest bidder, on account of
the claim , made that the work- in ques

matter, to include the statement that the
Union Iron Works discriminates against
union labor, and discharges every man
ascertained to belong to a union. Secre

MERCHANTS PREPARING
FOR INCREASE OF TARIFF
New York Firms Stocking
Their Ware
houses.
For the past several months we have
heard a great deal about the tariff meas
ure. Newspapers have filled their columns
with tic matter; the question was dis
cussed in the streets, at the fireside, at the
banquet-table.
Merchants racked their brains trying to
solve the problem. Wholesalers and man
ufacturers had their nerves s;rained to a
high pitch; it meant thousands of dol
lars if they could anticipate the turn.
To firms dealing exclusively in woolen
fabrics, the question was of vital import
ance. There was no lime :o theorize.
Hnsty action was to be taken.
No one realized this better than the
enterprising firm of S. N. Wood & Co.,
known as the Columbian Woolen M..1-.
The wires were kept hot carrying con
fidential information to the headquarters
of this firm, 18 and 20 Astor place, New
York.
Tne climax was at last reached when
the Government received in one day over
$2,000,000 for goods taken from bond. The
situaiion became critical. The financial
manager of the firm of S. N. Wood <fe Co.
telegraphed for M. Wood to report at New
York immediately. Obeying instructions
he !efi the next day. On his arrival in
New York the heads of this great firm de
cided to immediately withdraw their in
voices from bond; no chances were to be
taken.
Their banks were called upon for heavy
accommodations; the situation necessi
tated a demand for ready capital. .Like
many a New "York firm they stocked their
warehouses to overflowing, and a, so loaded
their San Francisco houses to the very
doors.
In order to meet the obligations of the
various banks Ben jimirj \Vood, one of the
Eastern manager- 1 , was ordered on to San
Francisco to raise sufficient ready capital
to be prepared for all emergencies in this
great tariff question.
Mr. B. Wood was interviewed by one
of our reporters and pave a glowing
description of the situation.
â¢ He said the outlook for the coining
season is biigbt and cheerful. The mills
are wonting night and uj.v ail over the
East. Tbc commission men have ac
cepted orders that will keep most mills
busy way into July.
Mr. Wood has decided to inaugnrate a
great sale of clotuing, and ever since his
arrival has been briny making preoara
tions. Everything in their house will
be marked down one half, ana he will
continue the sile until sufficient money
ca- been realized to meet all obligations.
The sale will commence next Monday
mornine promptly at 8 o'clock, and will
be li-kl at their downtown More only.

JEFFRIES PUTS
VAN TO SLEEP
His Trip- Hammer Blows
Too Much for the
Olympian.
Two Rounds Enough for These
Giants to Settle Their
Dispute.
Aft.T the Battle It Was Fouad That
Van Buskirk Had Ben
Serionsly Injured.
This man Jeffries can hit.
Attest: Theodore Van Bufkirk, the
Olympic Club heavy-weight, who once
had hopes that he would some day fight
for the world's chain Dionship. Van's jaw
collided with tne Los Angeles giant's
mighty right last night at the People's
Palace. Then there was another colli-ion,
but that was the meeting of the defeated
athlete's limp aii'i quivering form and the
resinedj floor. Five thousand people saw
Van Buskirk decisively relegated to the
back-number class, and from 5000 throats
roared the prophesy that Jeffries is the
rising star in the championship horizon.
Jeffries consumed a round and a half in
blighting the aspirations of Van B'iskirk.
He really accomplished that feat with the
very first blow he delivered in the con*
test â which was a veritable Fitzstmmons
heart punch, and had the effect of tem
porarily paralyzing Van Buskirk's entire
working system, but the leviathan from
the citrus belt was as much surprised as
was the Olympian, and when he did wake
up Van Bu-kirkha.i sufficiently recovered
to partially defend him e lf.
tie was given an unmerciful drubbing,
however, before the round closed. Van
Buskirk distinguished himselt In last
night's battle in only one respect, and
tbat was by his pluck in staying with
what be must have known was a hopeless
proposition.
He landed but one blow of consequence
on his opponent's anatomy. Tbat was a
right cross on Jeffries' jaw, a fairly stiff
one at that, but even then it was one Â«.f
thoie desperate swings which a fighter
resorts lo when he is pinned against the
ropes.
Th* finishing touches were a ripping
left from Jeffries, which landed in the
Olympian's abdomen, and a crushing
righthander en the j:iw. It was a com
plete knockout.
There were three events on the pro
gramme.
The big fight was late, due to Van Bus
kirk, who was an hour behind time. Van
Buskirk was attendel by Vincent White,
John Morgan and Frank Rafael. Jef
fries'satellites were Billy Delaney, Billy
Woods, Danny Needham and Jack Wil
liamson.
Little time was lost in gettinc ready.
There was the usunl inaugural fiddling
and cautious sparring for an opening when
the men met in the center. Both evinced
a liking for toe-dancing and ski] ped with
about the nimbleness of trained eiephants
at a circus. Van Buskirk soon saw an
opening and rushed, a; the same lima aim
ing his let for Jeffries' head.
The Los Ang.-les man cleverly ducked
under the blow. The men collided like
two ireiL-htcars, and us they did JVffriea
shot his left into Van Buskirk's lower ribs
under the heart. As they broke apart
Van Buskirk was seen to be reeling and
on the verge of tailing to the floor. There
was an expression of pain on his face and
he seemed to have lost the power to raise
his arms or move about.
In a second his attendant! raised th*
cry that a foul blow had been delivered
and jumpine into the ring saved their
man from fulline. For a moment pande
monium reigned throughout the place.
"JJo foul, said Referee Hiram Cook,
shaking his bead, and then he ordered
the seconds out ot the ring.
And all this time Jeffries stood looking
oi> with an expression of astonishment on
his countenance and had apparently for
gotten that he was one of the principals
in the contest.
When be did finally return to the at
tack Van Buskirk was nearly himself
aga.n and was lighting desperately.
Jeffries began sending some crushing
lett-handers into the German's wind, now
and then varying with a roorly aimed
right for the bead, but Van Buskirk was
plucky and showed no signs of weakening.
It was evident to all, though, tbat barring
a chance blow he was a defeated man.
The battle ended in the next round.
Jeffries opened with another of those
punishing lefts in the wind, and followed
it with still another that fairly doubled
up his man. A clinch followed, and in
the breakaway Jeffries delivered a right
on Van's left optic that left it puffed up
like a tomato.
Jeffries now followed his man about the
rinc, swinging right and left viciously,
bat really missing more blows than he
landed. He drove Van Buskirk to the
ropes with a left jab in the throat, and
before the big Olympian could regain his
balance Jeffries' left landed with a swish
into the wind.
This doubled Van and brought his head
forward. Jeffries saw his chance and de
livered the knockout blow with bis light
on the jaw.
Of the two "little" fights which pre
ceded the main event, the meeting be
tween the lightweights, Maxwell and
Morrisey, was the only one worth looking
at. It lasted three rounds and ended in a
knockout. It took Morri&ey's reconas
fully Live minutes to restore him to con
sciousness.
The other fisht was between Homer Mc-
Coy and Henry Slater. How McCoy ever
got the idea in his head that he was a
pugilist it is difficult to divine. S.ater
played with him lor about half a round,
and then began to hit hard. McCoy
wante ' none of that, so he laid down and
pretended that he was knocked out, for
which he was roundly hissed by the spec
tators.
Van Buskirk Injured.
After Van Buskirk left the ring last
night he complained of a severe pain in
his right side. He was taÃen to the Yo
s-mite House, and there examined by Dr.
Lus'.ig. The physician found that the
athlete had sustained a hernia. Whether
this was caused by a blow or by a strain,
the doctor wa3 unable to <ay which. Van
1! r-Kirk clams that it was tne blow that
Jeffries delivered in tne beginning of the
contest, and says further that it was a foul
blow at thai.
NOAH BROOKS IN TOWN.
An 0 d-Timo Newspaper Man of
California Revisiting Fa
miliar Places.
He Kn:w Abraham Lincoln Well
From 1856 Until th? Mournful
Day of April, 1865
Noah Brooks of New YorK, an old-time
Californian, a newspaper man of National
celebrity and a gifted contributor to re
cent literature of Abraham Lincoln, is in
Ban Francisco. He was here sixteen years
ago, but this is his first visit since.
Mr. Brooks was at the Bohemian Club
yesterday chatting about old times in
California with Uncle George Bromley and
telling anecdotes of Bret Harte, Mark
Twain, Isaac Bromley, Sam Williams,
Ben A very and Sam Bowles. Many
dinners, and good ones, Mr. Brooks has
had with men who figured largely in the
newspaper field of the United States. He
is an entertaining taker on many lines
and profoundly interesting when speak
ing of Lincoln, with whom he was well
acquainted many years before the great
Pretident was ever thought of for the
Presidency.
In 18.6 Noah Brook* was the editor
of tne Dixon (111.) Telegraph. He
attended many ot the raeeiines of the
Fremont campaign, which were addressed
by Abraham Lincoln. Later on Mr..
Jirooks came to California and engaged in
the newspaper business at Marysville.
He went East acain immediately after
the first election of Lincoln and became
the war correspondent ol the Sacramento
Union. After the war he returned to
California and serve*) a term as Naval
Officer of tbe Port of San Francisco. He
was an editorial writer on the Alta Cali
fornia from 1866 siniil 1871. Among his
colleagues on me Alta were M. G. Upton
and Colonel John C. Cremony.
Subsequently Mr. Brooks went East
aeain and was engaged on tbe staff of the
New York Tribune. He was on the New
York Times also for many years doing
j newsp aper duty as an editorial writer.
I For a time Mr. Brooks was editor of the
Newark Daily Advertiser, a journal which
was established so Jong ago tha it pub
lished Washington's farewell address as a
matter of news.
When Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated in
1861 Noah Brooks had the good fortune to
know the Presiduni as an intimate friend,
and so the correspondent soon became
familiar with the Cabinet officers of that
time.
Mr. Brooks' recent contributions to the
Century bring to the public light many
interesting scenes at the White House
during tbat memorable period. To use a
modern expression it may be said that
Noah Brooks was slated for the position of
Lincoln's private secretary for the second
term.
Mr. Brooks will remain in and about
San Francisco for two or thrae weeks. He
expects to go-to-day with Governor Budd
ana others to view from Mount Tamalpais
the rising of the sun Sunday morning.
Owing to his long experience as a writer
on morning newspapers, he will be able
to keep awake until dawn without the
slightest fatigue.
Found in Town Talk.
The latest and freshest criticisms of the
week's doings in social, political, musical and
stag* circles are found In to-day's Town Talk.
"Man In His Variety" is dissected by a mem
ber ot the local Four Hundred, ana the fiction
of the number is, as usuni, entertainingly
written. Litterateurs will be interested in the
book reviews, which are a feature of this
bright weekly, and musical people wtll find a
careful and critical analysis of runners
melodic in the department devoted to chords
and discords. The Saunterer is the author of
several clever stories. â¢
Improvement of the Wasp.
The WÂ»sp appears with a new cover and in
an entirely new dress this week, which add
immensely to its attractiveness. It presents
several interesting snap shots of prominent
citizens this week, the new Harbor Commis
sioner and a well-known member of the Italian
colony being among the number. Its '-Old
Maid's Diary" and the "Mulrooney Letters,"
descriptive of the ambitions of local politi
cians, are most amusing this week. Th-.- edi
torials are crisp and timely, the manufacturer!

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
Academic Field-Day Games â All About Boxing,
Fishing, Rowing, Baseball and Coursing*
The arrival or the Australian baseball
team snouM assist very materially to
boom the National game on this coast.
The Australian athletes are an active lot
of fellows, and doubtless there will be
ranch interest manifested among the
lovers of the game in the nrst meeting be
tween the invaders and the Olympic Club
players.
Boxing is aprnin having full swing, and
clubi are scouring the country for iirst
class fighting material. The trap-shoot
ers, anglers, cricketers, oarsmen, wheel
men, leashmen and lovers of rifle snoot
ing are looking lorward to a summer of
good sport.
THE WHEELMEN.
The Associated Ciufc>% Will Con
sider Relay Race Protests
This Evening:.
The adjourned meeting of the board of
governors of tne California Associated
Cycling Clubs will be held this evening at
the rooms of the Olympic Club Wheel
men. Among the ether important mat
ters to come before the board is the dis
cussion oi the protests over the relay race
last Sunday.
The track and road racing committee
chairmen of the association have issued
the following pronunciamenio with re
gard to racing in tins State in the future:
The Calfornift Associated Cycling Ciubs have
assumed control oi cycle-track racing In the
Stele of California. They have been impelled
10 this step dv the reiusal of the League of
American Wheelmen. ~ the hitherto accepted
governing body iv California of this branch of
tne sport, to recognize existiugcoadiiions In
this laic and to adapt its ;ruies thereto. The
article* framed by the Associated Clubs for the
government of racing accept the amateur deti
iiltion of the various amateur athletic organi
zations of America. Clubs are permitted to
pay the legitimate expenses of their members
engaging in contests where ihore is no prize
other than an â  Jnterclub trophy, and there is
no limit to the distancn irom their homes
within which amateurs may compete. These
rulings will permit clubs in all parts of me
Slate "to send their representatives to those
interclub amateur contests on the road which
the Associated dues hnve made classic, and
to those like contests wnicU will In future be
also promoted on the track. ' â â " . .; â 
Sanctions lor track meetings will be issued
for any day. There are no restrictions in this
respect. Acts which would professionalize a
rider if committed in connection with track
racing will have a like effect ii committed in
connection with road racing. The value of a
prize for which an amateur may compete on
the road is limited to $35. Tno track and
road racing committees will recognize and
eniorce eacn other's rulings and suspensions.
The track and road racing rules will be
printed and ready for distribution at an early
day.
Kiders are warned that by engaging in
track racing anywhere in the State of Cali
fornia at meetings not sanctioned by the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs they render
themselves liable to suspension from track
and road events .sanctioned or promoted by
the associated clubs.
Applications for track sanctions should be
made to K. M. Welch, chairman track-rncing
committee, 532 California street, San Fran
cisco.
The track and road racing committees ers
authorized to assume direction ol racing in
any State or Territory wnere theymay.be In
vited su tii do. The Caliiornia Associated Cyc
cling clubs are not seeding to extend their
bwav, preferring to enter into friendly al
liance with like organizations, but they wi.l
not refuse to admit to iheir jurisdiction the
racing men of neighboring t-iates who may
desire to avail themselves ot such protection.

fcPALDINQ.
RING AND GLOVE.
The Pacific Club Has a First-Glass
Programme for Wednesday
Evening.
The Pacific Athletic Club has an excel
lent programme of fistic sport for Wednes
day evening next and judging from the
material the directors ot the club have
selected for this occasion the patrons of
the game of fisticuffs can count upon wit
nessing a first-class performance.
Alex GreKpains is too well known to the
fraternity who take an interest in boxing
to need any particular comment. The ex
firemanjis, without doubt, the cleverest
heavy-weight boxer i;i America excepting
the ex-champi^n, Jim Corbett, and as a
matter of fact Greggaim is not a man who
polishes off his opponents by knocking
tnem Biiff, i*Â«t on the other hand he has a
happy way of jabbing nis antagonist un
til he becomes weak and discouraged from
the continous jabbing and body punches
which count in the long run. Greggains
has trained faithfully for this match, and
he will certainly give a good account of
himself.
The ex-fireman's opponent is Jack Stelz
ner, the heavy-weight pugilist who
handled Champion Fitz~imrnons when h*
trained for Sharkey and Corbett, and if
Fitzsimmons speaks the truth Stelzner
must be a hard man to whip. The Cham
pion said to a friend in this City before
taking his departure for the East that
SteJzner can wnip any good second-class
heavy-weight handily and ttiat none of
the top-notchers have a sure thing on
beating him. It can therefore be seen
that Gregtrains has a hard game to win,
and battles of this fcind are the ones the
sporting public delight in witnessing.
The second match arranged by the Pa
cific Club directors will assuredly be a
contest well worth going many miles to
see. The clever and plucky fighter, Lon
Agnew, will face his old opponent. Bob
Thompson, the tailored pugilist of Salt
Lake City. It goe^ without saying that
this match wi.l prove to be ol groat inter
est. Agnew has had quite a few uphill
contests in this City, and there is probably
not a tighter among the array of hard
hitting citizens who is more fancied by the
devotees oi ring sports than the pleasant
and reassuring Lon Agnew. He can al
ways be counted upon to go a good dis
tance in any kind of company.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors met yesterday
and agreeu to reoomniend that the Cali
fornia Athletic Club be granted a permit
for a boxing contest, to be held in the
month of Mar. providing that a .icense of
$100 De paid and that 5 per cent of the
trross receipts be pa:d into the fund lor
the relief of the unemployed.
TROUT FISHING.
The Warm Weather Will Insure
Good Sport to Fly-Casters.
The past week of warm weather is ex
actly what the anglers hoped for, as the
coast streams, which hare been runninz
high and murky since the opening day of
tha trout-rishinc season, will now assume
an appearance pleasant to the eye of all
lovers of the gentle and exhilarating pas
time of fly-casting.
The Faper-mill is gradually developing
a July appearance, and in a week or so
the rout snouid rise to a tir readily, as all
refuse matter washed from the bills into
the stream daring the freshets will no
longer be looked for by the gourmands of
the deep pools that afford such grand
sport to the fly-caster when a wnopper is
attached to the stretcher fly.
Latest accounts from the Papermill and
Lagunitas creeks stale that the water is
yet too high for fly fishing, and that the
latr heavy flood must have carried with
it large numbers of good-sized trout to
the ocean, leaving the fingerlinzs, which
ouud shelter in the tributaries to the
main creeks, behind.
J. McGregeor ol the mail service was at
Point Reyes on Ihursday and reports
fishing very poor there at present. He
explained why the fishing wÂ«s poor by
stating ti'ai the stream from trie bridge
which spans the creek near Point Reyes
to the sand epit was literally covered with
divers, and that the lone-i.ecked poachers
were killing hundreds of trout. The pro
prietor of tne Point Reyes Hotel engaged
two men to malce war upon the invaders,
and doubtless divers will be scarce in the
vicinity of Point Rpyes on Sunday.
At tbe least calculation tb> re were 1.50
anglers on the Paper-mill and Lagunitas
creeks last Sunday, but wuh few excep
tions they returned with more water than
tish. Al Smith, ihechanipion "worm" fish
erman, was high hook, and Senator Syd
ney Hall was next in line with a beautiful
basket of small steel; ead^. whicn lie
caught in the tidewater near Point Reyes.
The anglers who journeyed to Sonoma
Creek were not succe-eful, as the stream
was altogether too high and off color.
There should bo {rood tishing on the So
noma Creek a week from Sunday, as that
stream takes longer to run clear than
does the Taper- mill. Judge Oliver P.
Evans caught a pood wetting by caving
down the bank into a deep poul, but be
ing a thorough sportsman he did not
grumble because he caught a dousing and
very few fis â¢.
Judge Hunt returned from some favor
ite stream with very few rish. He ac
knowledged that it is too early yet to ex
pect anything like good fishing.
Colonel Cracknell and ''Cad" caught a
nice ba-ket of hsh in the little stresm that
run* close by the San Rafael Orphan
Asylum.
Bill Cooney and Eugene O'Rourke
wÂ«re among the first-Sunday-of-the-season
anglers who wet lines in Sonoma Creek
last. Sunday.
Horace Smy the caught about forty nice
trout last Thursday from the stream that
runs near Ross Station.
Al Wieland and John Siebe basketed
eighty trout on Thursday, which they
took from the Trockmorton Lagoon,
which is in the Tamalpais Club preserve.
Dan O'Connell and a friend visited
Tokaloma last Thursday, but "The"
O'Connell had poor lucK, notwithstanding
his knowledge of the game. He did not
look for large fish, as his basket was
about large enough to hold a few dozen
iiugerlings.
RIFLE AND PISTOL.
A Hundred-Shot Match Arranged
Between AdolDh Strecker and
A. H. Pape.
At last there is a match on between
Adolph BtreckÂ«r and A. H. Pape, two of
the best rifle shots in the Columbian Pistol
and Rifle Club. The match will be a 100
--stiot contest for $20 a side and will take
place within three weeks. The contest
will not be ao much lor the money as to
deiermine who is the better marksman of
the two in a lone race. Stresker is much
tbe older shot of the two, but Pape has
made tome wonderful strides in marks
manship within tlia'past few years. This
inatcli, which will be held on the Shell
Mound rang* and shot on the -new Co
inmbian target, has been on the tapis for
several weeks and marksmen are looking
lorward to the outcome of the event with
iiront interest.
Oil Sunday there will be a large attend*

ance on the Shell Mound rifle range, and
the following organizations will hold
their regular contests:

scooting. Companies C, G, F and X, First
Infantry, N. G. C.
In the last State shoot Lieutenant H.
Huber of Company l, First Regiment,
formerly San Franmco Fusileers, won
tne company's medal for good. This
medal has been competed for for twenty
three years, as it bad to be won three
years in succession to become the prop
erty of the winner. Lieutenant Huber
made the highest scores in the State
snoots of 1894, 1895 and 1896. Tne medal
is a beautiful piece of work. On the back
of it are the names and scores of tie
many marksmen who have haa the honor
of winning the medal since 1874.
TRAP SHOOTING.
Sport That Will Bs Had To-
Morrow at Various
Grounds.

much pleasure to the grand open-to-all
tournament, which will be held at the
Pacific Tournament grounds on May 2
under the management of those well
known sportsmen, the Golcher brothers.
The prizes are especially valuable, and as
there will be no entrance money charged
it goes without saying that the attend
ance will be something extraordinarily
iarge. The prizes have already been pub
lished in The Call. They should attract
the attention of trap-shooters from ail
parts of the State.
THE OARSMEN.
Great Activity Amons the South
Ends, Dolphins and

Prom the present outlook this season
promises to be a successful one for the
oarsmen. On last Sunday morning the
Pioneer Rowing Club held a club re
gatta in which crews from the South End
find Ariel clubs participated. Over twenty
boats started at the word "go," and for
over a mile the race was one of the most
exciting that has been seen on the bay in
many years. At the stakeboat the South
End crew took the lead, closely followed
by Growney of the Ariels and Captain
Will Thomas of the South Ends. On the
nome9tretch th c Pioneers made a desper
ate effort to regain their lost ground, but
th c distance was too great and they fin
ished about three lengths behind the
South Ends.
Captain Thomas reports wonderful im
provement in tne work of the junior
crews, and promises to have them in con
dition for the try-out regatta which will
take place on Sunday, April 25.
Ed Leary, Archie Campbell, William

the boathouse at a very late hour with
nothing to show but a faw crabs, which
Mr. Campbell caught with his oar on the
way home.

The Finance Committee or the Board of

on the application of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association to have James
P. Dunne retained as special counsel in

Soniro Furnished a Very Ex
hilarating Reversal
of Form
I&giesich Beat Hotspur Ontâ Alvarado
No M ten for Bernard! loâDuo
bo/ an Improved Sprintar.
The favorites were all beaten at Emery
ville yesterday. There was a reversal of
form or two, a smotkered wail or so from
the talent, the judges tapped the bell and
the tickets were paid. As Vace meetings
draw to a close, officials in the stand are
apt to overlook many little twists and
tortuous curves that would come in for in
quiry earlier in the season.
Old battle-scarred Hotspur was a slight
favorite for the opening seven-furlong
race, and, although he made a gallant
effort, was beaten out at the end by Zeke
Abraham's lngleside, second choice in the
betting.
The Cheat was made an even-money
choice for the two-year-old four-furlong
scramble and finished third. Bliss
Rucker, as is the good fortune that be
falls the Burn" & Waterhouse entries,
drew a good position at the post and,
leading all the way, led the twice "good
thing," Torsida, out by over a length,
rattling off the distance in 49 seconds.
The erratic Aivarado had a strong first
call in the betting on the starters in the
mile selling run, but was outfooted all the
way by the strongly played Bernardillo,
which won ealloping in 1:42. The winner
was a 3 to 1 shot in the bettiug.
A poor start worked the defeat of the
even-money choice, Morte Fonse, in the
mile and a furlong run. Charley Thorpe
had the lee up and just as the barrier
shot upward was cut off and passed the
stand way back in the n.ct. Hnzard at
odds of 9 tc 2 took the lead from Verugua
three furlongs from home and proved a
very handy winner in 1:57. The favorite
made a arreat run fiom behind, taking the
place from Oakland.

Soniro was beaten over twenty lenctlis in

The police believe they have landed the
murderer of Joe Manning. Manning, a
Barbary coast rounder, v?as shot down in
cold blood in Kayser's saloon, 104 iSonth
Third street, on the evening of December

police, as the crime was committed in the
presence of several people, yet no reliable
clew could be secured as to the Identity of
the murderer. T;ie latter circum^tunci!
was owing tamely io the character of the
inmates of the resort, who have no friend
ship for police methods, and partly, per
haps, to the suddennes of the onslaught,
the crime having been committed ana the
murderer having escaped before the spec
tators realized wnat had happened.
Manning, according to the confused
Biory which was gleaned from the wit

nil assailant rushed in and wun an oatb

thousands of women in this condition, there would be fewer disappointments
at birth, and they would not experience those annoying "longings."
In the following letter to Mrs. Pinkham. Mrs. Whitney demonstrates the
power of the Compound in such cases. She says:
From the time 1 was sixteen years old till I was twenty-three, I was
troubled with weakness of the kidneys and terrible pains when my monthly
periods came on. I made up my mind to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound and was soon relieved. After I was married, the doctor said I
would never be able to go my full time and have a living child, as I was
constitutionally weak. I had lost a baby at seven months and a half. The
next time I commenced at once and continued to take your Compound through
the period of pregnancy, and I said then, if I went my full time and the baby
â ^ lived to be three months old, I , should send a letter to you. My baby is now
Seven months old and is as healthy and, hearty as one could wish. .
*I am so thankful, that I used your medicine, for it gave me the robust
health to transmit to my child. I cannot express my gratitude to you; I
never expected such a blessing. Praise God for Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and may others who are suffering do as. I did and find relief, and
may many homes be brightened as mine has been." â L. Z. .Whitney, 5

ball-player, known as David Foss. The
detectives wonted on this clew for a long
time, and at last managed to locate Foss.
He was located in the far E st, and was
able to prove conclusively that he was not
in the vicinity of San Francisco at the
time of the murder.
At this point the sleuths were for a time
stalled.
A short time ago Police Officer L. C.
Clark was notified by a friend that the
murderer 01 Manning was not Foss, but a
man known amoni; the knights of the
road as Micfcey.
Thursday a man seeking a dime ap
proached Clark's informant while the lat
ter was conversing witn the officer who
was in citizen's dress. Clark was in
formed that that vai the man wanted
and the mendicant was put under arrest
for begging. Yesterday Sophie Smith, a
character well Known on the "coast,"
identified Mickey sis a roan glie had left to
consort with Manning previous to the
murder.
Mickey, who gave his name as Lano
when arrested but afterward admitted he
was known as P. A. Mickey, denies any
knowledge save that which is common
property among the "hoboos." He says
he csn easily prove that he wa-; "doing ten
i ays " for va K r ancy, under the name of
I 1 rank Johnson, at the time of the
murder.
Mickey is a professional tramp. He
says he has been on rhe road ever since
the war.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1897.
MISS LIN OY
TURNED LOOSE
Condemned by a Court to
Stay Here Unwill
ingly,
Although She Says That She
Was Landed by Rank
Perjury.
Manner in Which the Chinese Ex
clusion Act Is M de the Sub
ject of a Lurksqus.
Mongolian perjury yesterday wiped out
the victory achieved by justice on the clay
before by United States Commissioner
Heacock, when giggling Miss Ying was
remanded inio custody for deportation to
China, by the discharge of two of her
chums who came over on the same
steamer with her.
One of those maidens, Wong Lin Oy,
was taken before Judge Heacock yester
day for examination as to her right to
land here, it being claimed by the Govern
ment that the testimony given before
Collector of the Port Wise on â which she
had been permitted to land was false, and
that instead of being a native of San Fran
cisco she was a native of China, and there
fore excluded by the act of Congress.
. It appears that after Miss Wong Ling
Oy was landed, she and fifty- nine others
were fcund to be leading immoral lives in
Chinatown. They were taken to lie Chi
nese Piesbytenan Mission,' where Miss Oy
said that she was a native of China, had
never been in the United States before,
and that the testimony on which she had
been admitted to this country was per
jured. She flatly contradicted everything
to which she had sworn before Collector
Wise.
When this fact came to the knowledge
of the United States authorities Special
Inspector De Witt C Jackson swore to a
complaint against the three score maidens
I and they were arrested. It has now passed
; into history that they were allowed to
, land, with three exceptions, including the
singling Y'inp. Alter these arrests were
j maiie Inspector Jackson and other officers
scoured the Chinese quarter in vain for
the witnesses who swore that some of the
women were natives of San Francisco and
mat the remainder were entitled to land
on other grounds. Bui they failed to find
a solitary one of the Chinese shopkeepers
and merchants who had appeared child
like and band be.'ore Collector Wise and
I who had sworn to the things that were not.
So when the giggling Ying last Thurs
; day and the oletiginous Oy yesterday were
1 tried before the United States Commis
-1 sioner a brand new lot of Chinese swear
; ers were m attendance. They swore that
Miss Oy was a native of San Francisco;
i that they knew her father, and so forth.
; notwithstanding the fact of her denials in
the Presbyterian Mission. She was not
called as a witness herself, because she
I was the defendant, and she could Â«not be
( compelled to testify against herself. Her
j statements made in the mission were not
, corroborated, while there were half a
j dozen witnesses who swore otherwise.
The Csmmi- sioner accordingly decided
: that he would recommend Miss Oy's dis
; charge. ; His action was approved by the
! United States Attorney, who moved, also,
' that the same action be taken regarding
; the other defendant. The motio.ii was
i granted, and Judge Morrow mad* an order
! in the afternoon releasing the women.
"Alter she was arrested &he denied
! everything that she had sworn to before
1 the Collector." said Commissioner Hea
: cock to a Call reporter yesterday. "They
, btought in the affidavit? marie before the
j Collector, and then the question was,
'when id she tell the lie There. was no
! testimony whatever to corroborate her
contradiction, and there was no alterna-
I tive but to discharge her."
It will be interesting to watch the prog
ress of the case against the two Chinese
women detained at the Presbyterian mis
sion kb witnesses against Miss Yinf*. One
of them swore that she and the Ying
woman were born in China, and had led

Once More.
immoral lives there. The other testified
that BDe and Misses Yinp and Oy had
baen coached by a Chinaman to swpnr
th'ttthey wern native- of San Francisco.
Will they also be allowed to land?
If the rulÂ« should be followed out the
Commissioner must decide that what they
said in the nnÂ«s on i* not to be believed
and that the half dozen Bices highbinders
posing as merchants and storekeepers
must b? believed, and the women will be
turned loose upon the commutiity.
Collector Wise admitted that Chinese
women who have no neht to be here are
landed, but that is the fault of the evi
dence, not the Collector. It apparently
reputab c Chinese swear that they knoÂ«
those nirJa and their father* and that they
are natives of the United States, ihere m
o other course left but to allow thorn to
land. He cannot refuse them that privi
lege on general principles, as he has been
often advised to do, for the court will see
that the rights of the defendants shall be
maintained.
"When Chinese Women go to those
Christian missions," asked Mr. Wise,
"why don't the missionaries turn the
women over to the Government for de
portation ? The reason is that the mis
sions want to keep these women in the
country to reform them. It is their duty
to bring the c women before the court
and have them deponed."
Lawyer Mowry will appeal fiom Com
misv.onr-r Heacock's decision in the , cate
of Miss Ying. - ,
>â  The manner in which immoral Chinese
women effect a landing here is somewhat
of a farce. All that is required under the
existing law is to have naif a dozen al
leged shopkeepers swear that the women
are American-born and then have the
women coached on board the steamer or
in China before they leave. Should there
be an arrest after they are landed by the
Collector the first batch of perjurers may
remain in hiding and a second batch may
be secured for $5 a head.
' And in the midst of all this burlesque
Justice preserves the gravity of can owl
stupefied with steam beer, while prosecu
tions of Chinese for perjury are 80 rare as
to be invisioie.

"Eiceptins its handful of magnificent

The story of the life-work of this giant
among men has been often told and is

"Hsmlet" Attracts a Small but
C amorous Auiienceâ T;ie Bary
tone's Splendid Work.
It was the benefit ol Henri Albert, the
popular barytone, at the California Thea
ter lust night, and tbe bill was Ambroise
Thomas' "Hamlet," performed for the
first time in San Francisco.
Either of these two events ought to have
sufficed to draw a Rood I ouse, but owing
to the heat or the familiarity of "Hamiet"
as * drama the house was one of the
smallest o. the season.
What was wanting in numbers, how
ever, was made up in enthusiasm. At the
end of the second act, which ends with a
drinking songâ a gem of melody splen
didly rendered by Alber? â the hot! c be
cume noisily demonstrative. Not content
with flowers and bravos one enthusiast
rose up in his box and hurled a big wreath
of laurel on the stage, which Hamlet
dodged with neatness ami dezteiity just
when ii was about to strlKe his manly
brow.
There was no doubt about the favorable
impression made both by the opera of
"Ham. el" and the splendid work of the
principals. Practically it is a ter.orless
opera, for the part of Lseries, although
well performed by Deo, was too small to
have much effect on the general perform
ance.
â¢ The choruses in "Hamlet" are not very
numerous or important, and the burden
of the opera is sustained by the orchestra
and Hamlet, Ophelia, the king, the queen
and the ghost. Â . .., . ' :â -[â¢
Henri Albers in the title-role was splen
didly effective, both vocally and Histrioni
cally, and Mme. Berthet sang the florid
vocal embroideries of Ophelia with de
lightful ease.
It was not till the scene on the ram
parts .with the ghost that Albers had a
chance to astonish his hearers with a dra
matic interpretation" of a. tragic scene
which would have won him applause in a
prose theater. ... . .
As in his Rigoletto one was almost
tempted to forget His fine voice and beau
tiful phrasing in the dramatic power of
his acting. The invocation to the ghost,
"0 mon pere, O mon roi," .' and the whole
succeeding scene of horror, where Hamlet
learns of his mother's infamy, were acted
and sung with intense expression and feel

shcrls in sugar relimng being a feature of the
market for several days and which has influenced
entire speculation appeared to corns to an end to
day. AillS, the highest price recorded for the
stock, the recent urgent demand seemed fully sup
plied, aud a reaction of nearly two points occurred,
which left the stock fractionally lower than yes
terday. An sood as the general list showed signs
of hesitation the professional element apparently
came to the conclus on :hat the rally or -htfiast
three uays had run its course, and in cons -quence
a fairly nggrensive selling movement developed.
A more pacific outlook In the Levant and ex
tremely easy money in London were favorable in
fluences, the maiKei closing steady at fractional
recove les.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, April B.â Beginning about fire min
ums to 12 o'clock 10-day. when May wheat had
reacted from 07c, to which price It had *raluÂ» lv
risen, to around 66Vs c . a stampele commenced
which within fifteen minutes tumbled the price to
64% c. The break was due par.ly, It is said, to
the renewed bear operations for A. J. Weil, but
more largely to the selling out by RoD'-rt Lind
blora Â«fc Co. of 3,500,0(10 of long wheat. The clos
ing price for May was 647'gc.

WOOLâ Jacob Wollner's circular says: "We
have a lively, active market tor mostly all kinds
or Wool and at pn-ei that cannot bo realized In
Eastern seaboard markets. It is mostly all specu
lative, as our purchasing; brokers for Eastern ac
count cannot ge. any orders for Wools at prices
pevaillng. The arrivals this week have been very
iibera', amounting to about 40U0 bains. All the
Wools thai hare come in so far are in excellent
condition, being brighter and lighter than last
year. Especially is this a fact of Nevada Wools,
which will shrink fro v 3% to V>% less than last
year. Prices are well sustained. M-ourlnu-mils
cannot operate In this market as all the Wools
that have come In so far are shipping Wools.
Wools are graded and shipped East, as fast as they
come In. London auction sales closed on Satur
day last with a very strong tone. The Eastern
markets are reported active withstood deal of
Wool selling, but like In this market It is mostly on
speculative account, nit hough a>:ood deal is taken
by the mills. All we have to look for now is for
the >â¢â¢â !. â¢â¢ to pass the D I ml- ley bill at an early date
aud adopt the amendment of the House that the
bill should go Into effect on April Ist. : Of course
there h a diversity ot opinion as to whether thw
law will sustain the action."

Dr. and Mrs. Crowley Will
Be Remarried This
Morning.
Love for the Ciiidren Aided the
Adjustment of Difficul
ties
They Will Again Reside Wh?ro They
Formerly Sp?nt Maiy Very
Hippy Years-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
!*>;< Broadway, April 9. )
Rarely does a serious domestic difficulty
end as happily as the one thst brought Dr.
and Mrs. Crowley into prominence a lew
months ago.
This afternoon the announcement was
made that to-morrow morning at 10
o'clock, at their family residence on Alice
street. Rev. R. F. Coyle, D.D., will unite
DR. D. D. AND MRS. ALMA CROWLEY, Who Will Be Re-
Married To-Day by Rev. Dr. Coyle.
iv matrimony Dr. D. D. and Mrs. Alma
Crowley. Two months ago the fact that
the doctor and hi 3 wife had decided upon
a reunion was published in The Call, and
since that time has been frequently con
tradicted by interested partie?, but it has
always been the intention of Mr. and Mrs.
Crowley to bury their past and again live
together since a few days after the un
pleasant divorce proceedings.
In this reunion the children of the
Crowleys have played an important part.
No matter bow great the temporary dif-
Jerences between the parent*, there was
on the part of either an undying love for
their two children. From the night on
which Mrs. Crowley took her little ones
from their heme and took apartments at
the Metropole thr-re has never a day
passed that the doctor has not visited the
children. Little by little these vi-its to
the children grew more frequent, and their
effect was to bring to the minds of their
parents a realization of the fact that a
grievous mistake had been made, and that
for the benefit ol all concerned it would
be better to forget nil about the circum
stances of ihe past few months and start
anew married life.
The unhappy circumstances leading up
to the divorce have since Droved to have
been greatly exugeerated, and tbere is I
now no doubt, mat more ot the anpleas
antness was due to the nusrepreverr utions
of others than to anything that actually
iranspired between the doctor and Mrs.
Crowley.
Iniinediatr-ly after the divorcn was
granted Mrs. Crowiey took up her resi
dence at the home which was awarded to
her, and lor many months the doctor ha- j
been a regular visitor to his old home,
and it was therefore no surprise when the ;
announcement vas made of their wed- i
aing to-niorrow morning.
Dr. Crowley has lately been appointed ;
to the State Board of Health, and is a
most successful medical and surgical ;
practitioner. Mrs. Crowiey is a lady of â 
charming personality, a native of Ken- '
tucky and a musician of note, having
published several meritorious composi
tions.

FIRE AT THE
POWDER WORKS
Guncotton House Burned
to the Ground at
Pinole.
Employes, Fearing an Explc
sioD, Fled in Terror From
the Flames.
Narrow Escap; of the Nitre-Glycerine
Hcuse Which Was N xt the B az-
ing Eutldin;
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9liÃ Broadway, April 9. )
The California Powder Works was in
great danger a few nights ago. and the
people in the vicinity were in terror for
hours on account of fire w^ich completely
burned down the guncotton storehouse.
During the afternoon spontaneous com
bustion caused the storehouse, wherein is
enough guncotton to blow everything in
.sight to pieces, to take Hre. It had burned
for quite a while before some of the em
ployes noticed it. Tile alarm was given,
and for several rninutfls there was a lively
stampede of the employes, who ran for
their live 3. People Jivinz in the vicinity
ot the powder works do not take any
chances when a fire is discovered, bnt try
to put as much distance between them
selves and the fire as possible. If they
can pat a hill between them they are all
the more pleased. This ieeling animated
the employes as they ran away from that
burning euncotton storehouse.
Their frigin was greatly increased by a
knowledge of tl:e fact that the nitro
ulycjrine house was located next to the
burning building, and that nitro-eiycerine
la a more dangerous explosive than gun
cotton.
As it was seen that the flames were con
fined to the one building and that the
contents did not speedily explode some of
ihe employes returned anil succeeded in
keeping the fire from spreading. They
did not, however, save the guncotion
building, and with its contents it wai<
burned to the ground. The explosive,
however, was in such a condition that it
could not explode with any violence, and
th* greatest danger was that the flumes
shou d reach the nitro-glycerine house.
Captain Thomas Hig ins, the night
watchman of the Giant Powder Work*,
also saw the blaze, and his long experience
having taught him that blaz-s in that di
rection portend nothing pleasant he gave
the alHrm, and help was leaving the giant
works lor the tire when was received
tha: all danger was passed.
Although there are' occasionally small
fires at the | owaer works it rarely hap
pens that one of the Eize of that at the
California occurs withom doing serious
damage and causing an explosion.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1897.
FROST'S EMPLOYER
TALKS OF A PLOT
Says His Manager Was Not
Beaten by a Girl's
Friends.
Is the Fourth Time That the
Gang Has Committed a
Brutal Assault.
The Young Fa lows Declare that Frost
Dare Not Swear Out Warrants
Against Them.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
t;OS Broadway, April 9. \
The mystery surrounding the beating of
Myron Frost, manager of the Oakland
Lumber Company, is no nearer solution
so far as Mr. Frost is concerned. The po
lice, however, do not believe that two men
were beaten at the same time in the same
place, and are iucliaed to discredit Mr.
Frost's story.
As a matter of fact the three young fel
lows who beat the man near the Ebell
building who was attempting to take lib
erties with a young woman declare that
the man tney beat was Frost.
Detective Williams has ceased working
on the story, and declares that if Frost
will swear to warrants against those who
assailed him they will be vigorously prose
cuted. On the other hand, if Frost still
refuses to take out warrants the detective
says that he will not trouDle any iurther
with the case.
Frost sticks to his story that after dark
last Friday night he went to the rear of
the Ebe 1 building at tbe request of the
owner, Mr. Reod, to measure a window
for a screen and that while he was doing
so he was set vi on by some young fellows
who he says he cannot recognize, tie
then goes on to say that he is certain that
they are some young fellows who have had
a grievance against him forsome time and
were looking for an opportunity to do
him up. Frost denies tiiai h<Â» ever wrote
an anonymous letter to a young lady or
that any young lady was near the build
ing when he was so Violently assaulted.
There is just a chance that the anony
mous letter story may have been invented
by Frost's assailants as an excuse for their
conduct after ihey realized what they had
done. This is partially borne out by the
btatfment of Mir-s Giiiigan that she did 1
not receive a letter and was at work on the
evening of the assault.
J. he three young fellows, however, who
are credited with beating Frost, have
stated more than once that Miss Gilligan ,
was there, ana that they were tuere to
protect her, and tiiey defiantly assert that
they are perfectly safe, for Frost dare not
swear out warrants for tbeir arrest.
"We know who ti,e men ere," said Mr.
Reed, who is the proprietor of the lumber
yard, "but I do not wish togive any names
jut now. They make their headquarters
down about a saloon on the water front.
They are the samo crowd that assaulted
me some years ago, an<t have had a grudge
against us for years. Our HveÂ» are hardly
safe with them, ana I have called on the
police to break the gang up. They are
trying to work a woman into this case so ;

as to cast discredit upon Mr. Froit. They
will stoop to any mean* to carry out their
de-ire to injure us. We do not propose to
bo dictated to by thisganjr, and that i* iht>
reason for this brutal conduct. This is
really the fourth assuult that they have
been guilty of, nnd something must be
done with them."
NO ALMSHOUSE IN SIGHT
C. D. Vincent Njt Trying to
Railroad His Grandfather to
Poverty and the Grave.
The Other Silt <f a Sensational
Story That Create! Sr>me
Interest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, April 9. ,'
For several days stories have been pub
lished about the inhuman manner in
which a heartless grandson ha* tried to
rob his grandfather of ail his property to
such an extent that the old gentleman
was about to go to a poorhousc.
C. 1). Vincent, the one wbo has been
credited with such conduct toward J. N.
Williams, returned to Oakland and fiatiy
contradicted* all the statements published.
He says:
In retard to the *nlt brought m>iinÂ«t me by
my grandfather, J. X. Williams, the firstnotice
1 bad til It was iv & Los A.igeies paper on a
train near Sangus. I nave just returned to
Oakland this afternoon, nnd not having seen
a copy of the complaint fiied against me, can
only say that the statements which I have
seen published in the papers are false exc-pt
in that 1 am his grandson and thai the deeds
were execute i to me. The value of the prop
erty is exaggerated, nm beine worth in my
judgment over $40,000 or $45,000, and on
which there are debt- and mortg ges aggregat
ing $20,000 or thereabouts. The deeds were
made 10 me without my solicitation or re
quest.
I had refused to have anything to do with
them until i,e was taken 4pk, and it was rep
resented to me that his anxiety on account of
the Interest and other payments that he had
to make and the worry that it was causing
him would probably cause his death, that I
agreed to accept tne deeds and meet the pay
ments so far as possible. This is the real
reason thr.t the deeds were made to me; and
while he requested me to divide the property
Hiiiong my.^eli, my mother and my aunt in
case of his death, thai was in fact only a sec
ondary consideration with him at the time.
I dekire further to state that for Borne time
past I have been very closely engaged with
my own business fiff.urs and have been absent
from ray nome n Isrxe portion of tne time and
therefore unable to visit Mr. Williams as fre
quently as I had be<-n accustomed 10. and I
am satisfied that my ao-euc: has been taken
advantage of by people who had their own
and not hU interests ai heart, and that if left
to himself this action would never have been
brought.
BERKELEY'S ELECTION.
A Bitterly Contested Campaign in the
College Town I'rnvinj
to a Close.
BERKELEY. Cal.. April 9.â One of the
hottest p hiical campaigns ever held in
Berkeley will close to-morrow night,
wben the candidates will all have com
pleted their fight for the local offices.
Sunday will intervene, and then the day
ol voting comes.
At the last moment prominence has
been given to a new issueâ that of the
Berkeley Floral Society's plan to have the
town come under the provisions of the
btate tree-planting act. The proposal will
be on the ballots lor voters to approve or
disapprove by stamping opj osite tbe
"yes" or "no." Superintendent of Streets
Cnick has declared strongly in favor of
the L>lan, as have also some of the non
partisan party's leaders.
The contest for the offices has been fur
ther embittered by the effort to have the
Non-Partisan party's excluded from the
ballots. The latter declare that the legal
movements made aro a plan to deprive
them of rignts by pushing technical
points, ar.d if the final decision of thÂ«
court Roes against them, they will en
deavor to have the who c election de
clared invalid. The present officers, who
would then hold over for two years more,
are Xon- Partisans, and most of them are
on that party's ticket for re-election. The
ground of such an effort would be that
proper sample ballots were not distributed.
Should the court now order a change in
the ballots, it would De impossible for the
Town Clerk to prepare ballots anew in
lime foi the election.

OAKLAND, Cal., April The disap

year did not entirely allay the suspicion
that there is some gold in the northern
country. A party of Oaklunders left to

for nuggets along the Yukon. The party

than those to be obtained at Banir.ia.
BERKELEY MEN HOPEFUL.

BERKELEY, Cal., April 9.â On the
eve of the first of the series of three bnse
baii games to be played against Stanford
this season the Berkeley men are san
guine of a victory. With as cood a
Ditcher as last year and with a better ag
gregation of batters the U. C. men feel
that they will stand a good show of vic
tory against tbe Palo Alto nine. It is
conceded that Berkeley's battery is su
perior to that of Stanford, but on the
other hand the team work of the cardinal
players and their buoyancy through for
mer successes lends to offset the suDeri
or ty of Berkeley's pitcher and catcher.
Their last practice game this afternoon
was full of snap and but few errors^ were
noted.
Ihe jrarae will be held at Central Park
and will be called at 2 o'clock, following
are the men who will play for California:
Pitcher, Kaarsburg; first bas^e, Hennesey ;
second base, Elston; third base, Krue;
shortstop, McLaren; left field, Hoag;
center field, Hall; leit field, Sykes.

and then proceeding to view the town
generally.
Tne presence of the great man was soon
noised about and there was lively specu
lation about the object of the visit. Hun
tington, KruHschnitt and Crocker are not
wasters of time, and it is not regarded &a
likely that they spent a large part of a
very hot day driving about in tiie sun in
search of health. That some plans of imiort
ance brought trie big trio to tne university
town Is regarded as certain, but the magnate
did not open his lips to announce anyenter
pri-ch, nor did any of those who ought to know
vouchsafe any information on the subject.
At the local railroad offices nothing was
to be learned. Some of the officials did
not know that Hutilington was in the town.
They had heard that some one had seen him,
or that some visitor had been taken for him,
but us to railroad business that might cave
brought him, they were as speechless ax the
proverbial oyster. Outalde of railroad circles,
However, gossip was plentiful.
Among the reports currtnt is one that better
facilities are to be provided for North and
West Berkeley. The Utter now has a single
train that goes to and fro irotn Shell Mound,
while the former it on the regular Berkeley
local line-
Be'ween the two is the old unused California
and Nevada Kfiilroad, running from near
Shell Mound northward in the direction of
I'oint KicliiniT.il, the terminus talked of for
the new Valley Railroad, l'eralta Park, a
growing residence district, and Schmidts
Village, both at present ill supplied with rail
road lines, are wi.hin the district Inclosed by
tne two Southern Pacific lines mentioned.
The visitors went over tne ground and pro
ceeaert to Richmond Point.
It is stated ihat a loop to connect North and
West Berkeley and to incude the I'era.ta Park
district will be constructed. Such a line
would cover ground now only to be reached
by driving from the Berryman. East Berkeley
or Delaware-sweet station, and would secure
for its builders the patronage of what will one
dey be a residence district well settled.
Ah a part of the plan, It it said, the California
and Nevada Railroad wil.be absorbed to ex
clude possible future competition. The most
valuable tilings about this road are its fran
chise and the grading that lias been dove, as
the tracks ana rolling siock are not such as
could be put to use by Huntiugtoii's corpo
ration.
EFFIE HOLSTROM.
Judge Scan-oil trui D-ciiio the Ques
tion of Her Guardianship Neil
Wednesday Afternoon.
Judge Seawell heard a reargument of the
issues involved in the Effie V. R. Holstrom
guardianship contest, and his courtroom was
as usual crowded with women who have for
several months manifested intense interest in
this case.
The little girl, Effie, was born out of wedlock
four years and a half ago, and was delivered
by her rnothsr, Sarah Maguire, to Mr-. Lucinda
Holstrom, with a written agreement, that the
foster-mother should receive the child and
rear it as her own.
Romo time ago the mother married Mr.
d'Art--nay of Sola no County, and Bought to re
gMia possession of her child. This led to the
filing of conflicting petitions for guardianship
by Mrs. a'Artenay oa oue side and Mrs.
Holstrom on the other. A trial was had two
weens ago, and on the showing made Judjre
Seawell plated the little one in the custody of
the foster-mother, Mrs. Holstrom. but owing
to tbe fact thai the matter had not been lully
argu d he declined to sign the judgment-roll
ana reopened the cast- for further a-guraent.
Malt 1. .-Mil. i vim appeared for Mrs. d'Arte
nay. Hi.- said that the mother of the child
hnd displayed tier overmastering nffectiou
lor her oflsrrirg by n>Â»:rf everyihing she
held most, dear in life when she accompbnied
an officer 10 Mrs. Holstrom's home to secure
possession ot the child. She was happily mar
ried to a man who knew nothing of her early
indiscretions, yet she took the chanc?s of
nrotning his anger b\- bol.lly demanding her
c.'iild r.nd letting him aud the whole world
know ol her past.
Touching the question ol cruelty to the
child m separating it from it* foster-mother
Mr. Sullivan thought It would not lake more
than two weeks' timo witn kind treat-. tent,
candy aud such things to change the course
of its affections $â¢> thai it would be just as de
voted to its own mother us it now seems t â  be
devoted to its U^ter-m other. Mr. Sullivan
thought thÃt the temporal ai d eternal wel
fare oi the child demanded that Mrs. d'Arte
nay should ba given the custody of her off
spring.
Mr. Deuprey responded by making light of
Mr. Sul.ivr.n's ideas regarding the easo with
which a child's affections may be won away.
'i he learned counsel on the other side had
never known the jo-.s and sorrows, the re
sponsibilities and the pleasures of rearing
children. As tor himself, if such considera
tion-; as bad been sugges-t-d couid win nls
children lrora him he hoped that the shafts of
heaven might strike him de.id.
Mr. Beuprey said that aster the child, Effle,
was taken by force from Mrs. Holstrom, Mrs.
d'Artenay had the custody of thecnild for iwo
weeks, and had tne privilege of close assicla
tiou with her for two more montns, yet was
not able to win her affections. The court hed
uitn^sici that the child is devotedly attached
to its lcster-inother, Mr*. Holstrom, while for
Mrs. d'Arteuay it had ouly a feeling ot aver
sion.
Judge Seawell announced that he would ren
der his decision next Wednesday afternoon at
'Â£ o'clock, and <tirecied Mrs. Holstrom to have
the child In court at that time.

NON-PARTISANS MAY GO
A Writ of Review Served Upon
Town Clerk Hans
com.
Ticket of the Independents Also in
Dangerâ The Latest Sensation
of the Campaign.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 9.â The sen
sation of ibe campaign season in Berkeley
was sprung to-night, with the probable
outcome that the tickets of the Non-Par
tisans and Independent Taxpayers will be
thrown out at the election which takes
place on Monday.
A writ of reyiew was served on Town
Clerk Uanscom to-night, sworn to by Sam
Fisher of the People's party, ordering him
to appear before Judge Greene to-raorrow
evening at 8 o'ciock to show cause why he
allowed the names of the non-partisans
and independent taxpayers to appear on
the official ballots.
In the complaint it is alleged that the
Town Clerk committed an error in re
ceiving the affidavits of nominations of
these two parties upon the ground that
they were not represented at the last gen
eral election.
A demurrer was filed by Clerk Hanscom
through City Attorney Hayne. The de
murrer was argued before Judge Greene
of Department 2 last night. Upon the
conclusion of the argument tne court
practically decided the case, but on the
request of Attorney Chapman he con
tinued the case until to-day to bear fur
ther argument.
When court was called Judge Greene
asked the attorneys for the plaintiffs if
they had experienced a change of heart as
he hati intimated last night that they had
made a mistake in their m tbod of pro
cedure and should have issued a writ of
review. Attorney Graber, for the plain
tiffs, admitted that ne was wrong in issu
ing a writ of mandamus, and tne court
then sustained the demurrer. T is left
the case right where the contending par
ties began and so the writ of review was
procured to-night.

advice of Count Tolstoi, and divided his

KNOWN IN KNOXVILLE.
A CRIPPLE CURED.
The thicago "Times-Herald" Corre
â¢pondeut at Knoxvilla Meets
an Old Friend.
From the Times-Herald, Chlcaeo. 111.
At the Normal Institute at Knoxville, lowa,
on August 6. the Knoxville correspondent ot
the Onicego Times- Herald was much surprised
to meet his old friend, A. T. Conn, whom
he believed to be a llfe-iong cripple, iron) roeu
maiism Â«nd sciatica, moving nn>und as brisk
as anybody. As the ast time Mr. Conn hnd
been seen by the Times-Hera. d man he waa on
i-r : ell. -s, and in a terr.ble condition, the sub
ject of his recovery wis the topic ot conversa
tion. The fo. lowing is a resume of Mr. Conn's
Biory :
"You are aware that from overwork and ex
posure in April, 1894, I contracted sciatica
and rhiumutism, and grew steadily worse,
notwithstanding me best of medical treat
ment that the neighborhood afforded, until I
whs at last confined to my b.'ri, and what little
locomotion I performer was done on crutches.
From thÂ© time I was taken until August, 1895.
I tried every remedy 1 could iieÂ»r of, without
any relief whatever. It was at that time that
a friend recommended Dr. Williams' Pink
PiliS, and was so enthusiastic over their vir
tue- that I was persuaded to try them, and be
gan to take them in September, 1895. I was
rather discouraged at first to find mygeli de
cidedly worse, out was urged by my friends to
persevere and give the medicine a fair
trial, and so 1 did. After a while I
b.gan to feel on improvement, though
it was not noticeable to those around
me, but I knew I was better, and soon was so
elated that I foolishly discarded my crutches,
and received a severe fali for uiy pains. This
so retarded my recovery that I became dis
heartened, and gave up taking Pink Pills, so
great was my discouragemeut. I, shortly af.er
this nmhiipand set-back, began ng i . to ;aKo
the Pink- Pills steadily and persevennglv, and
in a short time c<>nl t walk without crutches,
and in January, 1890. was able '.o discontinue
the medicine aitoge-.her, being entirely cured.
Since then I have cleared a piece oi t>ru-h
land, and planted and attended (his year's
crop. 1 took in all seventeen boxes of Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills before I was entirely
cured."
Mr. Conn's address is PleaFnntville, Marion

KICKED BY A HORSE.
Willie Rogers Sustains a Serious and
Perhaps fatal Injury.
Willie Rogers, a five-year-old boy who
resides with his parents at 254 Minna
street, lies in a very critical condition at
the Receiving Hospital as the result of a
kick administered by a horse. At the
time tho animal was being driven along
Minna street by E. N. Richardson. Ac
cording to Mr. Richardson, the child ran
out into the street directly under the
horse's heels. Tne horse kicked out and
struck the boy full in the face.
An examination by Dr. Bonnell showed
that the nasal bone had been broken and
portions of bone had been driven into the
brain. The roof of the mouth was badly
crushed and the face was badly lacerated.
The boy was kept at the hospital for ob
servation, and his injuries may prove
fatal.
FOOD COFFEE.
GROCER'S SOLILOQUY.
The old story
They threw samples about town .
Loaded me up with goods
At lets price than the genuine
Said could make more money
I bit and got bit.
Must work off the stock
To get my money out,
It grinds tho'
To tell an old customer
The imitation is " just as good"
Drives them away sometimes.
About 403 Cereal Coffees
Have sprung up all over
To imitate the original
Poatum Cereal Food Coffee.
Every man out of a job
Thinks he can make it
Just brown some Rye or Barley
And there you are
A "Cereal Coffee" .
" Just as good as Po3tum"
Make pretty package
Sample the town
Load up the grocer
And drive on.
A fortune for every fool
In four days.
People find out
All that kind of rubbish
Tastes flat and unpalatable
It took over a year
Of scientific experiment
to perfect Postum
The only original palatable
Pure Cereal Coffee
In existence.
When properly made it has
' The color of Mocha
. The taste of Java
The elements nature uses
To rebuild the gray matter
. In the nerve cells.
- Postum is a Hygienic
Pure liquid food
Tons of rubbish
' Are sold to imitate it
But if customers would look
For red seals on packages and
Registered U. S. trade mark
They would secure the genuine.
Some good grocers' names
Get Smirched, when used
For "kitties paws" to rake chestnuts
For some "just as good"
As Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
P.ain, sober, common honesty
! And genuine goods in stock
- Is the safe way.
It might pay to throw
All that imitation away
A short-sighted grocer will
Grind away on the counterfeit
Until his money is back.
A keen, clean grocer
Will sell only the genuine
And keep customers.

King Owyang's Successor Recently a
Polic; Magistrate in
Hongkong.
The arrival of the Oriental and Occi
dental steamship Gaelic, which is due to
day, will be an interesting event to the
Chinese of this City, for on board is Woo
Tin Fong, the newly appointed Chinese
Minuter to th j United States, Spain,
Cuba and Peru, with headquarters in
WashiiiÃton, D. C.
Minister Fong is a gentleman of bigb
standing. He is a graduate of Oxford and
a lawyer and speaks English perfectly
and will appoint from his retinue of Â«>ixty
persons the Consuls-General for tue coun
tries in his jurisdiction.
The Minister is a ripe scholar and speaks
English to perfection. He formerly held
the position of Director of Government
Railways at Tientsin. It is expected that
his knowledge of the English system of
jurisprudence, bis wiiie learning and his
high standing at home and abroad will be
be used to inaugurate many reforms and
abate many evils which now prevail
among the Chinese population, especially
in California. It is hoped and expected
that he will take vigorous steps to stop
the illicit importation of women and
opium into this country.
Among the retinue is Ho Kai, who is
said to be elated for the Consul-Genera!-
Bhip at this port, now held by Fung Yung
Heng. Mr. Kai is also a noiabie sum,
being a graduate in medicine, law and
Christian theology, and recently occupied
the office of Police Magistrate in the
British colony of Honekong.
Vice-Consul King Owyang of this City
said to a Call reporter yesterday that Mr.
K.ai's Chiistianity wasno bar to his ad
vancement in positions of trust and honor
in the Ctiine.se Government, the civil
service of that country beine non-tec
tarian.
The Vice-Consul had not yet been in
formed of the name of his successor.
Chinese Ministers and those appointed by
them to Consul-Generalsnips, etc., hold
office for three years, at the end of which
time a clean sweep is made. All these
appointments are subject to the approval
of ihs Emperor of China, and he s?ldom
withholds his approval from any appoint

EXIT THE
CARNIVAL
The Projectors Agree That
the Money Cannot
Be Raised.
AFFAIR TO BE FORMALLY
WOUND UP.
Helping the Unemployed Was a
Serious Drawback to Its
Success.
A STATEMENT PREPARED FOR
THE PRESS.
Grand Ball Proposed at the Pavilion
to Discharge the Liabilities of
the Committea.
The carnival has died. At the meeting
last night of the executive committee at
the Columbia buiid.ng it was decided
after an exchange of views anent the hard
times to discontinue all further efforts to
carry the enterprise through, and, if not
to formally disband, at least to call the
effort off till another year.
Henry S. Martin, chairman of the finan
cial committee, stated to the meeting
that he had made vigorous efforts in the
downtown sections and throughout the
City generally to raise money for the
carnival, but was met on every hand with
the inquiry why a carnival should be
given now. The people he met said they
dicia't think it was a good time, because
they had to put up so much money for
the unemployed. To them it looked like
an incongruous proposition to be trying
to raise money for a carnival. He was
tired of it and didn't believe the carnival
could be carriei through.
Director-General Bergerot, who lately
succeeded S. H. Friedlander because the
latter gentleman had to go East on im
portant business, said he also had been
ruakintr a careful diagnosis of toe situa
tion. Things looked unflattering to him.
He had estimated that the carnival couJd
not be carried through to anything that
looked at all like a success for less vhan
120,000. As it was the committee didn't
have at pre-ent much more than a third of
that. The clouds didn't have a silver lin
ing.
Professor Emery E. Smith, director of
the floral part of the carnival, stated that
the floral people he was affiliating with
baa decided they could not keep up their
end respectably with the money that was
allotted them. As it appeared no more
could be granted he felt that in justice to
the Floral Society he ought to resign from
the executive committee.
These speeches with some others scat
tered along at random brought things to
a climax. A number of the committee
lia4 evidently previously foreseen that
the carnival couid not be c.-.rried our.
The enterprise had been, floated for
months, but the business men of the City,
let alone the people at large, did not take
hold of it with the ardor that was desired.
They could not for some reason De in
spired with the importance ot it.
Tue committee discussed the different
phases of failure for some time ana then
united in preparing a statement for the
press. It set forth the efforts that had
been made, the large sum of money con
tributed by merchants and others in aid
of the unemployed, and the fact that it
would be best to torero the carnival now
and postpone it to another year.
General Warfield, the chairman of the
carnival, was not present. He was at San
Rafael. The following was t&e statement
uiven out for the press. It was unsigned:
"The present executive committee of
the Golden Gate carnival, at its regular
meeting last night, decided to postpone
ttie series of proposed festivities Hereto
fore announced until further order--,
"This action was brought about by a re
port by the director-general and the
grand marshal, elected a week ago, show
ing the impossibility of carrying oat the
proposition on the lines originally con
templated within the short time to elapse
between now and the 3J of May.
"These gentlemen ascertained, after care
fally canvassing the situation, that, al
though the old executive committee had
been at work for nearly a year, they had
practically accomplished nothing and
ha<l signally failed in securing sufficient
subscriptions to insure the success of the
festival.
"The new committee found consider
able enthusiasm prevailing among the
people in favor of the carnival and a dis
position to liberally contribute to its
success. The money couid have been
secured, but as it was absolutely necessary
to let all contracts at once, and as the
committee had not sufficient time within
which to collect tho necessary funds, it
had no other alternative but to follow the
course tnat was adooted.
"Believing that a carnival would be a
source of great benefit to the community,
the committee has decided to maintain
its organization, and in order to discharge
t c liabilities incurred by the previous
committee it nas resoive.i to give a grand
tiall on the Bih of May at the Mechanics'
Pavilion, The balance left from the ball
is to be donated to the unemployed.
"The prizes lor the school children in
the word contest, which will close at mia
night to-night (Saturday), will be paid by
the committee as soon as the 3000 or more
lists can be gone over and the winners de
termined.
"The present headquarters will be main
tained until the affairs of the committee
are wound up."

day Next.
All Traveling in the State to Be Done
by Daylight for Better
Observation.
California's beauties and advan tages are
now being enjoyed by the host of South
ern Pacific traffic officials and commercial
agents, who were invited some time ago,
at the suggestion of President Hunting
ton, to gather in business and social In
tercourse at Monterey. They came from
all parts of the United States and from
Europe.
The contingent from east of the Mis
souri River left New Orleans last Monday
night and picked up the Texas men en
route. At Los Angeles their number was
augmented by the men of the southern
part of the State.
All their traveling is done by dayligh t
as one of the principal objects of the
unique gathering is 10 make every man
connected with the traffic department of
the Southern Pacific Company familiar
with this part of thÂ« country, so that he
may be the better able to induce the in
coming of home- builders and investors.
The entire party of invaders arrived at
Itedlands last night, where it w.is met by
Messrs. fcraurr, Gcodman, Luce, Donald- |
son, Horsburg and Fletcher trom this City. |
To-day and to-morrow will be spent In
doing Redlands, Riverside, Covina, Pasa
dena. Los Angeles, Santa Monica, San
Pedro, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara and
Fresno, and the various branch lines that
connect these points. They will leave
Fresno Monday morning and make direct
for Monterey, arriving there some time
during the afternoon. Stockton will be
the only point visited during the trip up
from Fresno.
Business matters will receive attention
on Tuesday, ana three or four days will be
devoted to the interchange of ideas, an'i
the discussion o! questions looking to the
improvement of the trarhc.service in detail
and as a whole. It is understood that
President Huntington and Messrs. Crocuer
and Hubbard will take a run down from
this City to exchange greetings with their
fishers of busines-. On Monday Traffic
Manager J. C. S'.ubbs will make the trip
to Monterey, and take an active part in
the proceedings. Many of ihe auents of
the company have never had the pleasure
of meeting the president 01 the company,
its principal officials, or one another, so
that this occasion will be one of unusual
interest, in view of the many new friend
snips that will be undoubtedly beeun.
Before this great human network is
again spread throughout the country, the
men will take a day for seeing the sights
of San Francisco. *ThÂ«y will return over
the central route. Mr. Hitchcock, the
local passenger ngent of the Union Pacific,

behalf of his road extended to the visiting

THE ZANTE GRAPE.
General Chipman's Account of Kfforts
of Interested Persons to Classify
It as a Currant.
General N. P. Chipman of Red Bluff,
lately appointed Supreme Court Commis
sioner, who has for some time recently
been visiting Washington, D. C, has re
turned here, and is at the Palace. Dr.
Chester Rowell of Fresno accompanied
him on his trip. They appeared before
the Ways and Means Committee in refer
ence to the so-called Zante currant, which
is in fact a crape.
The Greek Consul in New York, how
ever, and numerous merchants there have
been for a long time trying to deceive Con
gress with the idea that it is simply a cur
iant, so that it mar be admitted free of
duty. If this were done it would compete
with the California raisin grapes.
APPOMATTOX BANQUET.
D:nner Given at the Presidio
Club to General J. W.
Forsyth.
The Distinguished Guest Told th.
Story of the Great Surrender
in April, 1865
A dinner was eiven at the Presidio Ulnb
last night, in compliment to General
James W. Forsyih, U. S. A., commanding
the Department of California. The offi
cers at the banquet, aside from the chief

Lieutenant Haincs, Lieutenant Boyd,
Lieutenant Rutherford, Colonel Young,
Lieutenant Potter, Colonel Willoston,
Lieutenant Noble, Lieutenant Kilbourn,
Lieutenant Bent, Lieutenant Carson, Lieu

Clever speeches were made by General
Forsyth, Colonel Young, Colonel Bates,
Colonel Willoston and Maj .r field.
The occasion was the anniversary of the
surrender at Appomaltox. General For

staff of General Sheridan, and took an
active part in arranging the preliminaries
for the memorable meeting between Grant
and Lee. At the banquet last night be
told in a plain and simple style the story
of the active fighting and the pursuit
which preceded the culmination <>; the
war. The General's narration of the his
torical events was listened to with all
absorbing interest.
The banquet-hall was beautifully deco
rated with flags, ensigns and flowers. At
the plate of each officer was a rose of the
color to signify the corp* to which tho
guests belonged. For the staff there weie
violets.
Major Field was in a happy vein as a
speaker and depicted the humorous
phases of an active campaign.
The First Infantry band discoursed
music and in every sense the banquet was
a great success.

MET DEATH IN A
PETROLEUM VAT
Frank OTlanlon Instantly
Suffocated by Poisonous
Fumes.
Entered a Huge Tank to Clean
It and Fell to the Bottom
Dead.
A Rope Had Be n Fastened to Him,
bat It Slipped From His
B dy.
Frank O'Hanlon, a scrap-piler, met his
death yesterday afternoon by being as
phyxiated in a huge petroleum tank at
the Pacific Ilolling Mills.
The tank, which is about 25 feet deep,
contained several inches of oil. A gang
of workmen were ordered to repair and
clean the immense receptacle and O'Han
lon was selected from the number a3 the
man who should enter the tank.
As soon as the cover was removed it
was found that the receptacle was full of
petroleum fumes and O'Hanlon was
warned by his partner not to enter it. A
consultation as to the danger was held.
and it was tinally decided as a precaution
to tie a rope around O'Hanlon's waist De
fore he lowered himself, in order that his
life might be saved in case he was ren
dered unconscious by the fumes.
O'Hanlon tinally c. imbed over the edge
of the receptacle and sisirtedto lower him
self. He had not proceeded more than a
few feet, however, before the gases in the
Â»at asphyxiated him and he ttirew up his
arms. This allowed his body to slip
through the loop and fall to tne bottom.
No one could enier the tank to attempt
to rescue him until several minute 1 * li;id
elapsed to allow the pent-up gases toes
cape. Then another workman was let
down with a rope in the same manner.
He fastened a rope around the body and
it was lifted up.
When O'Hanion fell no sound escaped
him, and it is believed that he died as
soon as he struck the bottom. The unfor
tunate man was about 19 years old and
lived on Napa street. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
El Campo Kenpened.
Early this season, because of the perfect

Pacific Railroad Company has opened its
popular bay resort.
With the comraodions and finely
equipped steamer Ukiah plying to and

overcrowding; the unrivaled attractions
of the bay trio to the Mann shore; the
picturesque charm of an ideal spot, shel
tered from biustering winds and shaded
by numberless trees, there can nowh-.-re
be found a more delightful Sunday resort.
All days are sun days at El Campo.

MORE TALES TOLD
ABOUT DR. STAHLE
How the Ex-Superintendent
of the Hospital Obtained
Furniture,
Letters Confessing That Certain
Artie 1 es Were Taken Away
From the Institution.
The Grand Jury Is Willing to Re-en
force the Supervisors in the Fight
for Cheaper Water.
The Grand Jury at the regular meeting
yesterday afternoon resumed the investi
gation pertaining to Dr. F. H. Stable's
management of the City and County Hos
pital while he was superintendent of that
institution. The witnesses called were
Dr. Williamson, the present superin
tendent; W. D. Griffin, expert of the
Board of Health; Mrs. Knorp, the do
mestic in charge of the officers' quarters
at the hospital, and J. A. Miller of 960
Mission street, the furniture dealer from
whom Dr. Stable procured the carpets,
chairs, sofa and other furniture to equip
his quarters at the hospital and which he
subsequently transferred to his own domi
cile.
The Grand Jury yesterday did not finish
the investigation in this respect, but did
obtain much direct testimony to verify
the common gossip concerning the dis
position of tne furniture.
The testimony of J. A. Miller was
pointed and conclusive. His books,
which had been opened to the expert,
show the amount of the purchases. Mr.
Miller supplied the chairs, chiffoniers,
carpets, etc., on requisition of Dr. Stable,
duly approved by Joseph King, who was
the chairman of the Hospital Committee
of the Board of Supervisors.
The lurniture is stored in a warehouse,
ami letters are in possession of the Grand
Jury containing in effect a confession of
Stable that he did remove the articles so
purchased from the hospital to hi< own
rooms. Of these facts Dr. Williamson
and Ex pert Griffin are also cognizant, as
Dr. Stan le told tii -m what lie bad done.
Mrs. Knorp was an important witness,
because she has been employed at the
hospital for many years, t^he WBs there
when Dr. Titus 'vas superintendent. She
therÂ« marrie i Mr. Knorp, the late hos
pital steward, but the fact of the marriage
was not made known to the public until
the demise of Mr. Knorp, a lew months
ago. 'J hen the facts were disclosed and
she obtained insurance money on Mr.
Knorp's life policies. She has in her
mind a complete inventory of the car
pet?, chairs and other equipment of the
officers' quarters. It was given out at the
time the furniture went into the institu
tion that Mr. Stable had purchased the
articles on private account, and when he
moved them away no particular surprise
wns manifested.
It was expected yesterday tbat th re
port of the committee on corporations
would be adopted, and the publication of
the report authorized. The Grand Jury
desires to re-enforce the Board of Super
visors in its efforts to bring about a reduc
tion of water rates. For aome reason, the
report which the committee presented
was not acceptable throughout, and so
tinal action on its adoption was deferred
until next Tuesday afternoon.
