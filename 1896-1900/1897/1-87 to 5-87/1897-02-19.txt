VIENNA, Aistria, Feb. 18.â The Neve
Freie Prfsse says that 12000 Moslems have
been massacred at Sitia, a town in Crete.
Of all the Mohammedan residents of the
place only twenty-eight escaped. The
paper adds that toe Greek forces are sur-
rounding most of the village* on the
island. The foregoing is officially au
nounced in Constantinople, where the in
telligence has crrated much excitement.
ATHENS, Grf.f.ce, Feb. is. â It was ru

CANEA, Crete, Feb. 18.â Rumors of a
wholesale massacre of Mussulmans at
Sitia have reached here, some of the re
' ports placing the number killed at 2000,
. which includes almost the entire Moslem
population of the town. It is Â»aid that
men, women and children were killed in
discriminately by the Chiisttans. It is
impossible at present to confirm the re
ports, but the rumors have created the
. deepest anxiety here. GeDera: Bor, who is
in command of the gendarmerie at Canea,
has sent two officers of the gendarmerie at I
Sitia in a gunboat to inquire into tne â 
troth or JaJsity of the reports. 1
The fort at Voucoulis, which is garri-
Eonea by 500 Turkish troops, has been be
sieged for several days by a iarÂ»e force of '
well-armed insurgents. Yesterday the ;
commander of the besieging forces called
upon the Turkish commander to sur
render and promised safe conduct to any
of the garrison who chose to accept it.
The Turks refused to surrender on any
terms. It is stated that the garrison has
provisions enough to last for twenty days
and a plentiful -upply of ammunition.
It is reported that Greek troops started
to-day for Voucuulis to aid the insurgents
â¢ in the capture of the place.

concurrence of the powers in Greece's
action in Crete does not appear to have
had the deterrent effect that was antici
pated, and Greece is going ahead as
though she had the full consent of the
powers to her annexation of the island.
Colonel Va-sos. the aid-de-camp of the
Kinsr, who is in command of the Greek
troops in Crete, is already forming a local
administration in the name of the King
of the Hellenes. He is making prepara
tions for tJie holding of municipal elec
tions, and he will install Mayors in all the
towns and villages that are not occupied
by the forces of the foreign powers.
It is stated that Prince Nicholas, the
third son of King George, will not go with
the troops to the Theasalian frontier, as it
was stated yesterday he would, but that
he will join the forces in Crete.
All the Greek consulates in the island
have lowered their flags, it being consid
ered by the Consuls that as Crete is now
Greek territory their duties have ended.
It is stated here to-night that the war
ship Hydra, which was conveying provi
sions to the Greek*, was stopped by Brit

Cabinet Iteddet to Jv r Â«i,it in Its Cretan
Policy.
LONDON, Eng , Feb. 18.â The Athens
correspondent of the Standard telegraphs
that the Greek Cabinet held a meeting to
day, and after a full discussion of the
Cretan question decided to persist in the
policy regarding the island that it h,ad be
fore agreed upon.
A dispatch from Moscow to the Stan
dard says that in ttÂ» event of certain con
tingencies in the East, Russia will be ac
tively supported by Germany and Austria.
It has already been arranged, the dispatch
adds, for German troops to go south
through Russian territory to co-operate
with the forces mobilized in the Kieff
di>trict. The German contingent would
consist of two regiments of infantry. The
provisional date for the taking of decisive
measures was fixed ior February 20. but
the execution of the measures now de
pends upon the settlement that is made
ol the Cretan question.
All the reports received here concur in
the opinion that the proposal made by
Germany, that the ereat powers blockade
the Piraeus in order to compel Greece to
heed the representations made to her con
cerning her action in Crete, is not likely
to be adopted, owing to the opposition of
Great britain and Italy.
The Chronicle to-morrow will make
a splurge over a communication from its
special correspondent, Henry Norman,
who is now in Athens, and who will be
remembered as the representative of that
paper at Washington during the Vene
zuelan dispute. Mr. Norman sets forth at
length the Greek view of the situation,
ami his communication amounts to a dc
feÃH -i tLe action taken by Greece. He
says that after the powers in April last
compelled the Sultan to grant reforms in
Crete the Sultan ordered that the Cretan
Diet should not be permitted to meet.
During the coronation festival in Rus
?ia King George telegraphed to his son,
Prince George, who was representing him
at the coronation, asking him to bee the
Czar 'For God's sake make the Sultan
permit the meeting of the Diet or we will
have a revolution." The Czar telegraphed
to Constantinople requesting the Sultan
to permit the Diet to meet, whereupon the
Sultan complied, but the Cretan Mussul
mans were informed that if the Diet did
meet their cause would be lost.
Then began-the Musselman outrages in
Crete. Mr. Norman details the money
and other sacrifices made by the King and
Government in behalf of the Creians for

j driven to act to avert disaster.
Continuing, he says that Greece refused
to be coerced. Colonel Vassos has been
ordered not to ret re unless tie powers
lire on him, when he must retire inland
without replying to the tire. He is, how
ever, to resist the Turkish troops. He
adds that several thousand armed volun
teers are ready to enter Macedonia as soon
as the order is given.
The Chronicle telegraphed to Mr. Glad
stone, who is sow in the south of France,
a? icing him his opinion of the pro
posal that the powers should block the
Pirseus. In reply Mr. Gladstone tele
graphs:
"I detest the whole idea of using force
in behalf of Turkey, which has become an
outlaw."
King George has telegraphed to the
Cretan committee in London thanking it
for the support it has given him. In his
dispatch the King says:
"I am doing my best to protect the
Greek population who have been suffering
and righting since 1821 to obtain their
liberty and union with Greece."

for Greece is firmly determined to enforce
her decree, ordering the torpedo flotilla

that the commanders of the foreign squad

Colonel Vassos not to bombard the town

The situation on the frontier of Greece

KYLE GOES BACK
TO THE SENATE
South Dakota's Protracted
Fight Ends in a Big
Stampede.
Wildest Confusion as the Result
of the Ballot Becomes
Apparent.
Rpub icans Bring About the Climax,
Aided by a F w Populists and
Democrats.
PIERRE, S. D.. Feb. 18.â Six years ago
to-day J. H. Kyle, a comparatively un
known Congregational preacher, who had
been sent to the Legislature by a happy
Fourth of July speech, was elected to the
United States Senate by a combination of
Populist and Democratic votes. To-day
he was re-elected by the votes of Repub
licans and a few Populists and Demo
crats.
Early this morning tne rumor was cir
culated that the Republicans would vote
for Kyle. When the joint session met and
the roll of ttie Senate was called the Re
publicans voted for Pickler, and a look ot
disappointment came over the faces of
spectators, who thought that they were to
be again disappointed. When the House
roll was called, however, and the Repub
licans one by one voted for Kyle, it com
menced to look as though the long right
was about to end. As soon as the House
roll was finished, and before the vote of
either was announced, the Republican
Senators commenced to change lor Kyle.
This was the signal for Senator McManus,
who has been one of the chief lieutenants
of Kyle, to spring to his feet and say im
pressively :
"I've been fightiug Republicans all my
life and wben I see them take up my can
didate I must be true to my record, and I
hereby change my vote to Goodykoontz."
Then pandemonium broke loose and for
an hour there was a continual chance of
votea. The Populists fought in every way
10 gain time and try to break loose enough
Votes from Kyle to defeat him, but were
unsuccessful.
la an interview to-night Senator Kyle
denied the report that he had made any
do:tl with the Republicans. He declares
that he is a Populist still, has not changed
his principles and that the Republicans
came to him solidly because t^ey thought
Senator Pettigrew was against him and
they wished to humiliate Pattigrew.
Notwithstanding Kyle's public denial
that be has any understanding with the
Republicans, the latter generally believe
the story which is current that he has
committed himself to support all Repub
licau measures except the single one of
free silver.
The correspondent of the United Asso
ciated Presses was informed to-night by a
Republican who has been working on this
combination ever since the session com
menced that the interview which resulted
in the agreement took place this morning.
There were present, says the gentleman,
Senator Kyle, Congressman Picklerâ the
latter one of Kyle's managersâ and two
members of the Republican steering com
mittee. The interview was a protracted
one, and during it the whole ground was
covered. Senator Kyle, it is said, agreed
to vote with the Republicans for the tariff
measure and for every administration
measure. He reserved the right, however,
to vote upon the silver question as be saw
fit, but qualified this reservation by ex
plaining that since the last election he
thought that a measure for the free and
unlimited coinage of silver would proba
bly not come up in this Congress. Should
it coroe up he would not vote for it if it
were in such shape as to imperil the pass
age of any other administration measure.
He also agreed in this connection that lie
would vote for any measure looking toward
an international agreement for the recog
nition of silver.
Kyle's election it is thought will block
the State legislation that the Populists
have been expecting to put through and
is a particularly severe blow to the admin
istration of Governor Lee, who has some
measures he has been pushinc. He has
reserved his appointments and it is possi
ble that unless the breach is healed the
Kyle men may refuse to confirm his nomi
nations.
In consideration of Kyle voting with
the Republicans on the organization of
the Senate it is understood that Kyle will
receive the present committee appoint
ments of Senator Pettiyrew, which in
clude Ihe important chairmanship of the
Indian Affairs Committee, and that Petti
grew will be effectually turned down.
This is said to be the revenge that Sena
tor Kittredge has planned for his former
chief and present foe.

KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 18.â Private in
formation has been received in this city
of the wnereabouts of General Gomez. He
has succeeded in sliding by General Wey
ler and is now between him and Havana.
General Gomez gave the command for
an advance, with strict orders that any
man who struck a match or smoked
would be court-martialed. He then ad
vanced on the Moron trocha, in the east
ern end of the island, with 6000 cavalry
and 10,000 infantry.
He advanced on the fort at midnight
and when he saw he was discovered by
the Spanish, who fired on him, he ordered
the cavalry to charge.
They swooped down on the fort and
captured it and the whole army went
through the trocha. All of the arms and
ammunition of the fort were captured.
The army then continued the march and
was encamped at Vegnite when the news
was sent to this city by a courier. His
order in taking the fort was to use the
machete once, and the cavalry made a
most gallant n.ht.

STUART'S
SECRET OUT

as to Plans for His
Amphitheater.

Seating Capacity to Be Provided
for Thirty Thousand
Spectators.
REFEREE GECRGE SILER AR
RIVES AT CARSON.
Denies the Report That He Wcu.d
Introduce Niw Rules for
the F.ghters.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 18.â At last Dan
Stuart's secret is out. For days the
famous prize-ngiit promoter has been as
dumb as an oyster regarding the style and
plans of the mammoth amphitheater he
Is to erect at the Carson racetrack to hold
the spectators during the coming battle.
His lieutenants have been equally mys
terious and even less communicative.
What the reason for this secrecy was no
one could divine, and it was thought that
there was nothing to do tut to wait for
the official announcement. It was
Stuart's desire to kÂ«ep his secret until the
very day that active building operations
were commenced, but by some hook or
crook the story slipped away from him to
night, and now there are a dozen people
in Carson who know all about it.
Plans and specifications for the big
structure have been accepted and work
wit] begin immediately. The amphi
theater is to be octagonal in shape and
will be roofless. The ring will, of course,
be pitched in the center of the inclosure
and will occuuy an elevated position on a
platform four feet high. A space of six
feet surrounding the four sides of the ring
and immediately adjoining it will be set
apart for the reporters for the press. Then
behind the press seats and extending out
ward toward the eight sections of the oc
tagon will be reserved a radius of thirty
feet for the boxes. These will be the $40
seats. Next to the boxes come the next
highest-priced divisions. T..ese will be
placed in tiers rising from the floor to the
ceiling on the circus plan, and the cost of
them will depend upon their proximity to
the ring.
There will be four entrances to the
amphitheater. There will be broad aisles
between each section of the octagon and
an extra aisle in the center of each, ex
cept those where the entrances are lo
cated. This wilt divide the amphitheater
into twelve sections, and it is the intention
to have each of these sections accommo
date over 2000 people. Cnairs will be pro
vided for t ie first twenty rows behind the
boxes and back of those will be benches.
The design ior the building, as well as
the seating plan, is the handiwork of W.
J. Donohoe, the San Francisco architect
ami contractor. Mr. Dohohoe is tbe spe
cial protege of Governor Budd of Califor
nia, but his friends say ihis influence was
not brought to bear in order to secure the
selection of his plans. Btnart accepted
them because they suited him better than
any of the drawings submitted by local or
Eastern artists. Donohoe is the indi
vidual who once acted in the capacity of
expert for Governor Budd in connection
with tbe foundations for the union ferry
depot at San Francisco. It may be re
membered that he caused consternation
among the contractors by boring holes
into the piers and chopping into them
with a hatchet in order to test the quality
of the concrete.
The Donohoe araphithea'er will cost
Stuart in the neighborhood of $10,000. It
is not to be given out by contract. Stuart's
plan, it is said, is to purchase the lumber
and have the building put together by
Carson workmen. Donohoe will remain
here and superintend the construction of
the building.
George Siler, tbe Chicago sporting man
whom both Corbett and Fitzsimmons ac
cepted as the referee of tbe big fight, ar
rived here to-day from the East. Siler is
not in the best of health and it is doubtful
if he will display much activity between
now and the day of the contest. He was
ill during the journey from Chicago, but
believes he is now on the mend. He will
remain her a day or two and then go to
San Francisco to visit some old friends he
has not seen for years.
Siler is supposed to be on the "exclu
sive" list so far as giving information is
concerned, but be was found to-day to be in
about the same hr.mor as Corbett and
Julian are â ready and willing to be inter
viewed by the correspondents.
"I have been quoted as saying that in
this coming contest I intended to adopt
rules of my own making, " said Siler.
"Now, I want to say that that statement
is untrue, and I never gave uttorance
to any such thing. I have been too long
in the business to imagine that 1 can im
prove or alter old-established rules, such
as those founded by the Marquis of
Queensberry. 1 propose to see that both
men have a fair and square deal. I have
absolutely no choice between them and
only hope that the best man may win,
and I believe they wlil put up a square
and honest tightâ and not only that, but
the greatest battle ever witnessed in tbe
roped arena. There can be no question
but that these are the most scienced and
clever lighters who ever stepped into a
rine.
"The agreement signed by Corbett and
Fitzsimmons to break away decently from
the clinches is indeed most satisfactory to
me, as it will save me a deal of work and
trouble."
Owing to the fact that tbe dawn of to
day brought forth another snowstorm,
which continued all day with more or lest
violence, Corbett was compelled to a. am2
abandon his intended departure for his
training quarters at Shaw's Springs. In
depd it begins to appear as though he
would be unable to go there tb.s week. In
tbe meantime he is not permitting him
self to be idle and get rusty. He has en
caged the Carson Opera-house for tem
porary training quarters, and intends to
exercise there twice a day until he can
move out to the springs.
Shortly before noon to-day lie stripped
for some rough work with his trainers at
the opera-house, and the favored few who
were admitted to see him at his practice
had cause to marvel at the champion's
wonderful powers of enduance and agii
ity. He seems to have recovered his old
time ginger and spring, which, it will be
remembered, was so woefully lacking in
his late unsatisfactory battle with Sailor
Sharkey. tie hops around like a French
dancing-master, and seems never to tire
of it.
"He is a glutton for work and is as
strong as a lion," was the remarK made
by his trainer, Billy Woods, as he sat and
puffed like an engine after a bout with the
big fellow.
Corbett began with a rattling four min
ute boxing bout with Woods, and, the
latter beine then wir.ded, big Jack Mc-
Vey was thrown into the breach. Cor
bett does not box with McVey, who is a
wrestler, but content* himself with pull
ing and hauling the giant about the floor
and practicing clinches with him. Me-
Vey's pnysiognomy was barked in a dozen
places to-day as the result of the hugging
and mauling he received at Corbeit's
bands. As soon as McVey cried out that
he had enough, \VooJs retured to the at
tack with the gloves. And so it went on.
the trainers alternating with each other
and Corbett never resting. This was con
tinued for just liity-live minutes and then
Jim, who even was scarcely blowing,
thought it was time to rest and take a
rub-down. This afternoon be went
through the same performance again, but
shortened the working time to thirty-five
minutes. This wiil be the regular routine
now until the storm lets up.
Martin Julian, Fitzsimmons' manaeer,
went through the formality to-day of
eiening a lease for the ase of the Cook
ranch until after the 17th of March. He
hired a sleigh and went out to lake an
other loot at the training quarters he se
lected for the auburn-haired Cornishman,
and was more pleased than ever with the
place. â¢
"There's a parrot out there that says
'What d'ye soy' and several other similar
choice bits of slang, and Fitzsiromons is
Bure to adopt the bird as his mascot be
iore l.c's out there an hour," expla;ued
Julian upon his return.
Martin might have returned to town in
better humor than he did were it not that
he met with a mishap on his way back.
His learn ran away with him and dumped
him into a snowbank. Some kind-hearted
farmers came to his assistance and shov
eled him out of hii retreat, but neverthe
less he had to walk home. In such a
blinding storm as prevailed at the time
this was no joke.
W. M. Coot, the proprietor of the ranch
where F.tzsimmons is to train, is busy
getting things in readiness for the recep
tion of his guest. He Las set apart the
best bedroom in the house for the Cornish
man and another for the latter s wife.
Fitzsimmons Â»ili pursue his old plan of
eating nothing during his training except
such food as is prepared by Mrs. Fitzsim
mons. The ranch is completely under
enow at present, and presents a rather
dreary aspect. Ii comprises 320 acre?, in
cluding a pretty grove whicu is used for
Vicnics during the summer months. It is
in tni^ grove that the dancing pavilion,
which Fitzsimmons is to convert into a
gymnasium is located. This is a roomy
structure, 50 feet long by 40 ;eet wide, and
is just the place for boxing, club-swinging
and bag'punching.
Julian was offered a bonus to-night if he
would locate Fiizsimmons' trainingquart
ers at the Wiegin ranch, near Empire, but
he had to decline it, as he had already
signed with Cook.
Dan Stuart's persistent seclusion has
been accounted for. For several days those
who inquired for him at his office were
informed that the Texan was closeted
with architects and contractors, but it
turns out that Ihe genial promoter Das
been a very sick man. He was taken
down Tuesday with a bowel complaint,
and has since been unable to leave bis
rooms. He had a relapse last night, and
it required the efforts of two physicians
during several hours to get him out of
danger. He was reported to be improving
this afternoon, however, and his friends
expect to >cc him out again before tne end
of the week.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 18. â Bob Fitz
simmons and party arrived here at noon
to-day. Fitzsimmons eluded the crowd
assembled at the depot to me him, and
drove up town alone while the mob spent
its enthusiasm cheering for the trainer,
Dan Hickey, who was mistaken for Fitz
timmons.
In an Interview this afternoon, Fitz
pimmons said be was feeling well, and was
very confident that he would whip Corbett
within ten rounds. He did not want to
do any boasting now, but would reserve
that until after March 17, when he would
have reason to talk. He said he was
champion of the world now, and would
demonstrate that he was a better man
than Corbett.
iutzsimmons was not aware that Julian

A LETTER FROM CORBETT.
THE Call, at tremendous expense and by the exercise of
almost devilish ingenuity, has succeeded in intercepting one
of Champion Corbett's letters to the Examiner. This price
less literary gem is here given in its entirety, and it is prom
ised that if this astounding piece of enterprise on the part of
THE Call is appreciated by the yearning public, other letters
will follow.
Carson, Feb. 18, 1897.
To the Journal- Examiner or Examiner-Journal:
Great and Grand Friend â I arose at exactly nine and
a half minutes past 6 this morning, in good health and
spirits.
I can whip Fitzsimnons in fifty rounds. I never have
whipped him, it is true, and even if I knew that I could not,
it would not be business to say so. What am I here for?
But 1 digress. I washed my face at 6:20 o'clock. This
is correct, and I am confident the Journal-Examiner â that is,
the Examiner-Journal â will have it exclusively. No one saw
me.
I had breakfast at 8 o'clock. This, lam sorry to say, is
not exclusive. The hungry sleuth of the press saw me and
the fact is now throbbing along the heated wire. But 1 did
not like the steak. 1 pledge you my word that this valuable
fact is all our own.
At 10 o'clock sharp I hung a picture of Mr. Heaast on the
wall of my room. Why did Ido this? you ask. Let me tell
you. The champion of the globe has chords in his heart to
which the cold and clammy world is a stranger. He loves
soft things.
The story that the picture represents Mr. Hearst in the
act of buying a gold brick is a foul calumny invented by our
business rivals. 1 respect the chief of our staff too much to
have anything around me that would give him offense. The
brick was not gold.
I may add that 1 respect every member of our staff, with
the exception of Mr. Earp. You remember that we published
a lot of hair-raising stories over Mr. Earp's signature and
that when he was on the witness-stand in the trial that grew
out of the Sharkey fight he swore that some one else wrote
the stories and all he did was to sign his name to them.
1 call that low down.
1 shouldn't be a bit surprised if some of our readers
remembering it should get to thinking that Mr. Bierce or Mr.
Hamilton or some one else in the office writes the articles that
1 sign.
But I have digressed again. I ate three meals to-day
and punched the bag. lam confident that 1 can whip Fitz.
This is exclusive and authentic.
1 see that in printing my articles you use the same type
that you use in telling about the uprising of the Greeks, the
war in Cuba and Mr. McKinley's Cabinet. I think you do
me an injustice. Can't you give me larger type, or couldn't
you use red ink ?
You sometimes forget to put a border 'round my stories.
Don't let it occur again.
I expect $1000 for this letter, as it's twice as long as
usual.
Yours lovingly,
JIM.
HOUSE DEPARTS
FROM A CUSTOM
Reverses the Decision of
Its Committee on
Elections.
Seats a Kentucky Contestant De
clared to Have Been
Defeated.
Minority R pert Contends That Fraud
Vitiates Everything, and This
View Is Sustained.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 18.â In the
contested case of Hopkins (R.)vs. KÂ°n
dall (D.) from the Tenth Kentucky Dis
trict the Hou-e to-day for the first time
this session on a direct issue of fact re
versed the decision of its Committee on
Elections and seated a contestant whom
the committee haa decared not elected.
The case turned upon the action of the
Connty Clerk of Clark County, Ky., who,
without proper authority, had substituted
what was called in the debate an "odious,
thieving coon" on the ofik-iai ballots in
place of the eaple â the choÂ«en emblem of
the Republican pi rty of Kentucky.
It was admitted by the committee that
this was a "transparent fraud" and that
it was done with intent to deceive, but it
was contended that the number of votes
lost in this manner was not enough to
overcome the sitt.ng member's majority
of 523 over his contestant.
Tue minority report contended that
fraud vitiated everything, and that the
entire vote of the county must be thrown
oat.
After an exceedingly animated discus
sion the House sustained this view by a
vote of 197 to 91. On the only previous oc
casion in this Congress where the Election
Committee rece ved a setback William H.
Moody of Massachusetts, w^ho led the for
lorn hope in to-day's debate in support of
the majority report, was the successful
assailant. He made a minority report of
one in the case of Rinaker and Downing
in the First Illinois District, not in favor
of sealing Rinaker, but of having a recount
of the vote. In this tlie House sustained
him and on a recount Rinaker was elected.
In the division to-day of the ten Repub
licans who voted to sustain the majority
of the committee three were from Aiassa
cbusetts, whicli led Handy (R.) of Indi
ana to remark that "Massachusetts had
slobbered over 'op mucb," an insult to
Massachusetts which Moody indignantly
rejented.
The rest of the session was given ud to
the passage of bills by consent, which led
the leader to consent to a speedy adjourn
ment, and at 4:30 the House adjourned
until to-morrow.
BBSBIOS Of iH t. SENATE.
Postage of a Hill Contentplnting a AÂ«u<
Poital-Cartt Syttnn.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 18.-The
Senate passed to-day without a word of
explanation a bill which if it becomes a
law will introduce a new postal-card sys
tem. Its title is, "A bill to extend the
uses of the mails." It v,as introduced in
the early part of the last session by Vilas
(D.)ot Wisconsin and was referred to tbe
Postoffice Committee, from which it was
reported back with amendments on the
18ih of last month. A week ago an at
tempt was mads to have it parsed by
unanimous consent, but objection was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1897.
tnen made by Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska,
who sad that from the reading of the bill
it appeared Jo propose the conferring of a
monopoly. Vilas admitted that it did
con er a monopoly, but said that as the
company concerned owned the patent for
the invention there must necessarily be a
monopoly.
Alien promised to look into the matter,
and when Vilas asked unanimous consent
to-day fur the passage of the bill and said
that Allen was satisfied with it, no obj c
tion was made and the bill was passed
without its even being read, except by
title. Its purpose is to allow the circula
tion by mail of postal-cards and envelopes
with coupons attached, patented and
owned by a West Virginia corporation,
at regular postal-card and letter rates,
"paid on presentation of the coupons
from the ?aid cards and envelopes when
detached at the office of delivery." 1 lie
PusimaMer-Generai is to test the practi
cal operation of the plan in one or two
cities and then suspend its operation if
the test prove unfavorable. There are
nine sections to the bill, but they do not
convey a very clear idea of the plan.
The Senate adopted without d:scu~ssion
the House bih for the admission of
needlework imported by the New York
Association of tfewinn-Bchools for exhibi
tion purposes.
The feenate had spent only twenty
minutes in legislative session when on
motion of Sherman (R.) of Ohio the gal
leries were cleared, the doors were closed
and the consideration of executive busi
ness was entered upon.
After three hours 1 debate on the Ami
don cas-f> the nomination was continued
by the decisive vote of 3.3 to 14.
By a further vote of 32 to 27 the Senate
decided at 5:30 to take up the arbitration
treaty and the debate upon that conven
tion begÂ»Â«n when Nelson of Minnesota
took the floor for the purpose of moving
postponement of further consideration of
thp ireaty ontil March 5. Nelson was
anxious to have the banki uptcy bill called
up find believed that this and other press
ing business should be attended to at the
present session. The treaty iou dgo over
until the extra session without harm.
A lison, chairman of the Committee on
Appropriation*, was of a similar mind
and said that he believed it would require
all the remaining time of the Senate to
consider the appropriation bills. Frye of
Maine took the same view, but siibse
qnently admitted that it would perhaps
be better to dispose of the treaty now.
Hoar took strong grounds against post
ponement, as did also Platt and Lodge
To the surprise of the Senate Vest came
out in a strong speech favorine the early
ratification of the ireaty as amended. He
declared that the people of the United
States demanded thU convention, and
that its negotiation was the re-ult of a de
sire for peace and general arbitration on
the part of the people of the two great
English speaking peoples of the world. It
was a good treaty, he said, and ought to
ratified.
fcherman in a very brief statement said
he believed the vote ought now to be
taken, and be was confluent if that were
done tbe treaty would be ratified.
Morgan and Daniels, bold of whom are
opuosed to the treaty, said they were pre
pared io go on with the nebate'if Snerman
desired a night session, but this statement
frightened others who were tired of the
proceedings, and a motion was made to
adjourn. This motion was defeated by a
small majority, several of the opponents
of the treaty voting not to adjourn.
Blackburn asserted his opposition to the
convention and declared that it could not
be amended in any way so as to meet his
approval. He hor.ed the motion to post
pone woula not be pressed.
By this time thÃ hour of 7 was ap
proaching and Sherman saw that it was
impossible to keep a quorum present. He
therefore gave noiice that immediately
after the routine business of to-morrow
he should move an executive session, at
which he hoped the treaty would be dis
posed of. Sherman urged Senators to be
present and remain until the vote was
taken.
There seem* to be a disposition to com
ply with Sherman's request, and the
chances appear to be rattier good for a
session extending well into ihe evening.

SENATOR LEXOW
USING THE PROBE
Puts Searching Questions
to Representatives of
Combines.
Mr. Flint Makes Admissions
Damaging to the Rubbsr
\ . Monopoly.
H. 0. Havemeyer Tells as Littic as
Possible About the Sugar
Trusts Methods.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. IS.â Senator
Lexow and his colleagues oi the joint
legislative committee appointed to inves
tigate the existence of trusts and monop
olies in this State metacaiu this morning.
In anticipation of an interesting session
there was a large attendance of the out
side public.
Mr. Havemeyer was in attendance at
the funeral ot the late William P. St.
John, but Lawyer Parsons assured Sena
tor Lezow that he would be present after
recess. Mr. Pardons said he had been
authorized by a meeting of the board of
directors of the American Sugar Refining
Company to preient the agreement in re
gard to the purchase of the Philadelphia
concerns and the information regarding
labor and taxes paid by the company, bu:
Seuator Lexlow said the committee would
like to have Mr. Havemeyer before the
committee before putting the information
in evidence.
Charles R. Flint then took the stand.
He was asked if he had secured the figures
with regard to the wages paid by the
United States Rubber Company and com
peting companies. Mr. Flint said he was
unable to secure all the details, and he
was then asked if any one in the employ
of the United States Rubber Company
had destroyed the facilities for the manu
facture of rubber on Long Island.
"I know nothing aboutany such thing,"
replied Mr. Flint.
"Did the United States Rubber Com
pany destroy any property in Brook
haven ?"
"Not to my knowledge."
"Now, don't you remember that it was
one of your agents that destroyed the
plant of the Brook aven company after
Mr. Elbertson bought it?"
"I have no knowledge of such a thing."
"Have you any branch of the business
which provides for the destruction of
property?"
"1 can ascertain. I don't know."
Chairman Lexow tried to get Mr. Flint
to admit that whenever the United States
Rubber Company advanced money to fac
tories it did so for the purpose of con
trolling the output and fixing the price o,
the goods, but the witness would not see
it in that way.
The witness then pave statistics show
ing the wages paid by the United States
Rubber Company to its employes and the
wages paid .by the fcetauket .company.
According to Mr. .Flint's figure^ his com
pany paid more than the Setauket com
pany to its employes. lie said that work
ers in iirst-quality rubber shoes made $2
10 $3 a day and cutters get from $3 to
$3 50.
"How is it that the Setauket factory
cannot compete with the United States
Rubber Company, although it pays 25 per
cent Jess for its labor?' '
"Weli, we claim that we get more value
out of our wage-earners than they do, al
though we pay theni 25 per cent more.
We have also more labor-saving devices
and more economy in production."
"Why is it when you increased your
aeihues, as :ar as your plants were con
cerned, you did not go to a piace like
Setaukt-t, where labor was 25 per cent
elip.tr;er?"
"We thought it best to incrpase the
plants at our larger factories. Further
more, our specialty is the production of
high-grade kooils. "
Senator Lexow smiled at this reply.
"Mr. F lot," be said, "pray do not adver
tise your goods any more."
Witness admitted that there were more
men employed by tbe independent com
panies before connoliuaiion and that tbe
prices of rubber shoes had increased
s. nee.
"Now, to put it plainly, Mr. Flint, has
not t lie entire general stock of me United
States Rubber Company been what is
known as wat< rea?"
Mr. Flint paused a moment, and then
wem on to desc-ibe how the stuck was
issued. "Our stock," he said "was issued
lor L";oawiil an i to pay for properties."
'Now, does not a preat deal of your
stock represent only water, which your
company's directors expect some day to
develop into stock whicti may pay divi
dends?"
"We have our trademarks and patents,
and they are very valuable â just as valu
able as brick and mortar," said Mr. Flint.
In reply to another question, Mr. Flint
admitted thai one oi the objects of the
consolidation was to enabi^ the property
to be put on the market in a realization of
form.
"Then, to the industrial feature of the
enterprise is added the ability to dispose
of itscertiriiates of stock?"
"Undoubtedly, sir."
At this juncture Chairman Leiow an
nounced a recess.
A Bubpena duces tecum has been is
sued on James Benford of the United
Btatei Rubber Company, who has the key
to tue Â«afe deposit vault in New Bruns
wick, N. J., to produce the schedule of
purchases and other papers asked lor by
the committee.
After recess H. O. Havemryer took the
stand. Witness identified a copy of the
agreement made by the Knight Rehning
Company for the sale of its property as a
correct one. Afier witness had identified
copies of the agreements with other com
panies ami declared a document showing
the amount of taxes paid by the company
irom 1892 to 1896 as correct, he sa.d he
thought that the statement made by
Mr. Searles that the .Brooklyn factories
ofihe company produced 20,000 barrels
per day was right.
Witness said hiÂ« company paid in this
State lest y*ar $33,615 in taxes for per
sonal, real and household property. He
also stated that about one-ha.f of the pro
ducing capacity of his company was in
this State. He declared that his company
had as much raw sugar stored in Boston
as in Brooklyn and twice as much in Phil
adelphia as in either of those cities.
"How comes it, then, when half of your
producing capacity is in New York, that
you do not pay taxes on $30,000,000."
"I do not see any relation between the
two things?"
"Do you know where the deed of the
American Sugar ftefining Com pan v is? '
"No, sir; 1 do noL :l
Mr. Havemeyer then said that the
figures showing the distribution of the
preferred stock of the company were cut
out by Mr. Parsons by permission of the
Arnold committee at" the time of the in
vestigation by the United States Senate.
"Do you mean that?"
"Yes. sir. I say the figures were cut out
at the time ot the Arnold investigation by
Mr. Parsons, without regard to anything
tefore or since. The figures wore never
replaced to my knowledge."
"Who had the custody of the mutilated
trust de*d?"
"Mr. Parsons."
"How was it that you and your assist
ants were so soLcitous to conceal these
papers?"
"A hundred people agreed to have that
done, i am noi responsible. The deed
should have been destroyed."
"Why?"
"It should have been destroyed because,
in my judgment, it was that deed that
caused ail the trouble and hostile legisla
tion against the company."
"You mean prosecut on, don't you?"
'Mo, 1 say persecution. All the fuss
has been over that deed. If that .eed had
not been in evidence the legislators would
have been figiiiing the air. All this sort
of thing has been swept away by the Su
preme Court."
"What do you mean by that?" asked
Senator Lexow.
"Oh! I thought you were conversant
with things that had gone before in this
matter by former investigations," said the
witness.
"I am in a general way," replied Sen
ator Lexow. "But explain what you
mean.'"
"I mean that we have had these investi
gations Det'ora; that one Judge has ruled
we are a criminal monopoly and another
Judge that we are not. The Supreme
Court has swept all thia aside by declar
ing we are not a monopoly, inasmuch as
we do not stifle competition."
Henry Burns, president of the National
Wall-paper Company, was the next wit
ness. He was not one of the original in
corporators or original directors of the
corporation, which was organized in July,
LBB2.
"Were you connected with any company
at the time of the organization?"
"Yes, sir: with the .Robert Greaves
Company."
Witness said that twenty-eight compa
nies in all were absorbed by the National
Wall-paper Company.
"How many companies were left oat of
the combination?"
"About seventeen."
"What amount of business did the com
bination secure?"
"About 65 -per cent, judging by the ma
chinery we employ. We have 183 ma
chines as against 88 of those not in the
combination."
"What was the capital stock issue!?"
"lhe^onginal issue was $14,000,000 and
fll subsequently increased to $'27,000,000
or $28. 000,000. Ttua was common stock."
Witness said that $8,000,000 of deben
ture stocK was author. zed, but only $7,
--500,000 was issued.
"How did you arr ye at the proper dis
tribution of stock?"
"We calculated the profits of the vaii
ous concerns for certain years and multi
plied it Dy sixteen."
"In other words, you capitalized each
concern at 6 per cent and bonded it, the
issr.eof common stock."
"Yes, sir, common and debenture. We
subtracted from this amount, however, a
lot of tangible pronerty which we issued
in debentures. The rest was given in
common stock."
"How do your prices compare with the
prices of the companies not in the combi
nation?"
"Our prices are 25 per cent lower. The
wages also have not decreased. They are
about the same and the employment is
steadier. About 5000 men are employed
by the company in the United States."
"Have you an agreement with the sell
ers of your product in New York ?' '
"Yes, in one or two cases."
Witness said they had competitors in
New York State who worked under agree
ments.
"Are these agreements similar to
yours?"
"I do not know the methods our com
petitors use. I only know there is a wall
paper trust somewhere."
"You claim, then, you are not a trust?"
"Yes, sir."
"The agreement you have with your
sellers restricts them to the sale of your
goods?"
'â¢ Ye*, sir."
Adjournment was taken until to-mor
row morning, and the witness was directed
to produce the agreement.
AST Off MOT IN FAVOR.
The American Editor of the Pall Mall
Gazette Roasted in the House
of Commons.
LONDON, Esq. Feb. 18.â Quite a scene
was created in tte House of Commons to
day by John Burns, Sociali-t member ior
the Battereea divisioa of Battersea and
Clapham. Tbe occasion was the debate
of a proposal to erect a new hall for the
use of the London County Council.
In the course of the discussion Mr.
Burns, himself a member of the City
Council, made an attack upon the Pall
Mall Gazette, owned by William Waldorf
Astor, because of its opposition to the pro
posal. The opposition of the paper to the
erection of a new building on the site of
the present o'ie was purely in the interest
of Mr. Astor, whose house adjoined
the Council building. In concluding his
remarks Mr. Burns said he could stand a
decent duke or a militant marquis, but be
o uld not endure the miserable and nn
gentlemanly conduct of a new millionaire.
After further discussion the proposal to
erect a new County Council hall was re
jected by a vote of 227 to 146.
Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, in the course
of discussion of the claim made by the
South African republic for indemnity tor
damage sustained by the raid of Dr.
Jameson ami his followers into the Trans
vaal, said that the Boer Government
claimed for moral damages Â£677,938. and
for moral and intellectual damages Â£1,000,
--000. This remark of the Colonial Secre
tary provoked great laughter.
SIX PEOPLE BUTCHERED.
Horrible Tragedy in North Dakota, for
Which Indians Are Held
Responsible.
WINONA, N. Dak., Feb. 18.â The bodies
of Rev. Thomas SSpicer and wile, their
daughter, Mrs. William Rouse, with her
one-year-old twin boys, and Mra Waidron,
mother of Postmaster Wa'dron, were
found on the Spicer plantation, near here,
to-day. Ail were horribly mutilated and
the tragedy is supposed to have been the
work of Indian* from the Standing Rock
Indian Reservation.
The bodies were found at different points
on the ranch. ind ; catinii that the victims
had fled from their assassins. Tie sus
picion that the work was done by Indians
is strengthened by the fact that an Indian
was seen near the ranch shortly after day
light yesterday. The bodies all bear
marks of clubs and knives, weapons which
the Indians are known to have in their
possession. The Standing Rock reserva
tion is but a few miles west of here, and it
is supposed that a party of Indians got
away, and, inflamed by bad whisky, de
cs ruled upon the ranch in tee night and
murdered all the occupants.
The Indians could have committed the
crime and made their way back to the
reservation during the night. There is
mrch excitement uere over the discovery,
and the Government Inspector at the
reservation will be called uoou to-morrow
to investigate the affair.
The bodies were discovered by Walter
Smith, a farmhand, who immediately re
port-d it lo the authorities here. The
bodies were brought to this city this even
ing and an inquest will be held in the
niorninir.

KILLED IN THB RING.
Pugilist Ben Co/eman's Neck Broken in
a Prizefight in Cincin
nati.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 18.â To-night
occurred the first fatality for Cincinnati at
a boxing match. In the preliminary con
test at tLe Manhattan Club room at River
side, a few miles out from the city, Ben
Coleman, aged 22, was knocked down by
Joe Rodgers, of about the same age. Cole
man did not attempt to rise and he was
hastily carried from the ring. A doctor
examined him and pronounced him dead
of a broken neck.
It is not known whether the fall or the
blow killed him. The body was taken to
the morgue in a patrol wagon. Both box
ers were colored. Rodgers d-isappeared in
the crowd, but the police are after him.
The star event of the |evenine, a go be
tween Jim Johnson, the noted animal
painter and boxer, and Al Roberts, who
once fougnt a draw with Kid McCoy, took
place in the ring after some delay, owing
to the panic that the fatality in the first

PÂ». in. ADELSBACK.
The picture fairly represents a man in
good, robust health, and this is just the
condition ot Mr. P. F. Adelsback of Ma-
dera.
When seÂ«n by your writer he was frank
and outspoken in the praise of Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla.
A friend of Mr. Adelsback used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla for kidney com-
plaint and was cured. He had many
pimples on his face before using Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and as they disap-
peared he told Mr. Adelsback of the fact.
Many are the peculiar, and, at times
wonderful, yea. singularly remarkable re-
coveries from the use of this herb remedy.
Hundreds of persons began taking the
remedy just as a laxative and gradually
eot over chronic affliction. Madera has
had many of such peculiar cases . and
nearly all of them came t.o the hearing of
Mr. Adelsback. It is for these reasons that
hn used the great Californian remedy, and
now he rejoices and tells his friends, his
neighbors and all what good has been ac-
complished for him.
Don't, let the drug clerk talk you into
buying sora otliing else for Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. â

Fruitful Work of Attorney
Joseph H. Call of Los
Angeles.
Through His Efforts Vast Tracts
of Valuable Land May Be
Taken Up.
Forfeited by the Rai roads According
to a United Sates Supreme
Court Decision.
LOS ANGELES, Gal.. Feb. 18.â The in
de:atigable labors of Attorney Joseph H.
Call of this city, special (iovernment coun
sel ir. several cases involving titles to
large bodies of the public domain covered
by re;lroad land grants, are bearing fru't.
His :at-st victory over a railroad corpora
tion is comprised in v decision of the Su
preme Court of t lie United States, which
is of ti.e greatest importance, since it cov
ers r very vital principle of Federal iaw
and will eventually open about 5,000,000
sere* of valuable land in California and
New Mexico to the use and permanent oc
cupancy of actual settlers.
The case was entitled Atlantic and Pa
cific Railroad Company vs. Robert Min
gus, and wbs brought by the company to
eject MinguÂ« from a certain tract of land
in New Mexico, the land being witnin the
erant of IS<3Â« to the Atlantic and Pacinc
Company. The company contended that
the attempt of Congress to forfeit the
grant by the act of July 6, 1886, was null
and void, in that the fauit for not build
ing the road as stipulated in the grant
wa? witn the Government and not with the
company. Tue company alleged that the
Government had undertaken to extin
guish the Indian titles to the Territory, as
preliminary to the location and construc
tion ot the road, and had failed to do so.
The Supreme Court of New Mexico was
dlviaed in its opinion and upon appeal to
the Supreme Court of the United States,
Attorney Call of this city was directed to
fcppear on behait of the Government and
present the case, which was submitted
last December.
Call argued the case on behalf of toe
Government in that court, contending
that Congress was empowered to forfeit
the grant for failure to build the road.
Tne decision of the Supreme Court just
rendered is against the contentions of the
raiiroad and in favor of tne Government,
and holds mat Congress nad the power to
forfeit the grant.
Tne lands in Southern California
Effected by the decision are the same
lands claimed by the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, wherein it has been
held that those lands were forfeited ior
the benefit of the Government and not for
the benefit of the Southern Pacific Com
pany.!

Plea of the Jfitimbnnd in. the Ueilbrnn
Divorce Suit.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 18.â The
marital woes of William C. Htiibron and
liis plucky little wife are becoming both
numerous and complicated. Tne lady be
gan divorce proceedings on January 2L
and the court made an order that the hus
band pay the wife $60 per month pending
the proceedings.
To-day Heilbron was in court to explain
why he had not provided his wife with the
r.ecessary funds. The young man had
what he considered sufficient excuse, and
in explaining his neglect was called upon
to sive some account of his business. He
raid that running a billiard parlor and
cigar-stand was not all profit. He told
how he owed $700 on the tables and his
creditors were pressing him for payment. I.1 '.
He had no income outside his business.
If he were compelled to pay her $60 a
month and settle np the amount already
due bis billiard and cigar enterprise was
likely to pass into the hands of giasping
and mercenary creditors.
In reply to a question, he said that
when he and his wife lived v:> in Seattle
they had ample funds and lived in com
fort, and even luxury.
"You lost most of your property during
the real estate excitement, did you not?"
suggested Heilbron's attorney.
''We lost on account i>f a lack of excite
ment," he replied, which was quite con*
sis'ent with the probabilities.
The defense intimated that MrÂ«. Heil
bron was not in distressing circumstances,
that sho had diamond worth more t.'.an
$1300 and proi erty in Seattle that yielded
handsome rents, besides having money in
bank. Heilbron said he nad explained
his financial difficulties to his wife.
The defendant was informed by the
court that he must see that his wife and
two children have something to eat, even
if he and nis businees suffered in conse
quence.
The charpes in the complaint for divorce
are willful neglect, habitual drunkenness
and extreme cruelty. This branch of the
case will bo heard next Tuesday.

An Enterprise lh.ui irlves Promise of
Griat Return*.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 18.â There
is a fair prospect that a fish-carmine plant
will be established at Redondo Beach.
Persons interested in the project have
askea an experienced Eastern fish
packer to make an estimate of the cost of
a plant capable of providing for the busi
ne-v He has iiivesngated and accorditie
to his figures Mich a plant may be placed
here lor about $-000. This would include
apparatus such as seines and other things
for catching iish. As tne business grows
the capacity of the plant may be in
creased. The waters off-hore there
abound in sardines, sad, in fact tlie San
Pedro cannery is supplied with them to a
Jarge eHÂ«n:. This iine of business is sÂ».id
to be such that one concern need not in
jure aiother in proximity to it.
Half the sum estimated to start the can
nery has been pledged. When once actu
ally started it would probably take three
months to finish construction and set the
plant in actual operation. It is believed
the establishment cooiu also with profit
dispose of the great quantities of surplus
yeliow-tail ana other fish caught there
during the summer mouths.

virtue of a license obtained in Orange

unexpected trouble.
Mr. Mott took oath before the County
Clerk that he was -'1 years â¢ f ape, and as

It tranipiTes vow that the father of the
young man says he is only 19 years old.
County Clerk Brock, who was in this city
to-day, was seen in reference to the mat

matter will not rest where it is now if it
be ascertained to a certainty that the
young man i* really under age. By the
omission of .he word "brothor" in these

made to appear ttiat he (the newly mar

and foothills. Ttu> rain was not specially
needed, but will do much tood. The pre

ORANGE HEAPS
DRAPED IN SNOW
Soft, Fleecy Flakes De
scend on Cloverdale's
Citrus Fair.
It Serves but to Add Beauty to
the Exposition of Golden
Fruits.
Large Crowds Journey to the Fiesta
Which Is Auspiciously Opened
to the Public.
CLOVERDALE. Cal., Feb. 18.â The air
and tne scene were redolent of the tropics
inside the Citrus Fair Payilion to- day, but
outside the chill, contrasting hand of
winter had touched the dills and dales
daring the night and left them robed in a
wnite and glistening garment of snow.
Inside the pavilion oranges and lemons
were heaped in huge pyramids; outside
they were kissed by ripples and tufts of
snow, or had icicles hanging upon them.
To say that the people of the upper
Sonoma Valley were astonished when
tney awoke thn morning exactly ex
presses their feelings.
An old rancher who sat by the fireplace
in the hotel this morning after a long
drive said he had lived In the valley forty
years and had uever seen so much snow
be ore, and the quantny was only about
one inch on the level. It gave the orange
trees which ornament the lront yards of
Cloverdale residences a new beauty and
did not hurt the crop tne slightest.
The crowds that attended the pavilion
seemed to greatly enjoy the novelty.
They pointed to ihe snow as another ex
ample of the exceeding diversity ol Sonoma
Valley climate. Sleiehs laden with merry
makers passed through drives ornamented
by orangeb. By noon tlie light fall of snow
had melted and a gentle rain began to
fall. Tiiis i> the lirst spell of unfavorab c
weather that bas yet descended on Clover
date's i itrus fair. It is not regard c! as an
evil oao, however. Tue people take it
philosophical.}', sayinjr they cannot ex
pect to have the weather bureau perpetu
ally on their side.
The weaiher did not decrease to any
noticeable extent the crowds that came in
excursion trains from oilier cities down
tue valley. About noon a long train ar
i rived with enthusiastic excursioni-ts from
Santa Ro*a, Petaiurna, Healdsbtir.; aid
other towns. This crowd, with the peo
ple o ( ioverdale and its immediatt vicin
ity. curup:eiely nJIeJ the pavilion during
the afternoon and at night.
A decided novelty ot the day and exhi
bition ib that while it was winter outside,
dozens of canary Dirds hanging an.
swinging in cages amid the piles of
piunea, olives and golden fr.it vi*Â»a with
I each other in their glad -ongs and rilled
the bix hail with a chorus of melody.
t lowers have b*en aaded to the fiesta and
festoons in green, white and yellow now
sweep in graceiul curves across the sce;je
and the decorations are complete Some
of the decorations are comprised of al
mond blo-som*. Below them are the lusc
| ious nuts of the previous blossoming.
This evening A. W. Foster, Dresident of
the San Francisco and North Pacific Kail
road, said in regard to the citrus fair:
"Tha people of San Francisco would be
astomsned if they could ?ee thu magmti
cent display of citru- frti't. It I* the fin
j est exhibit that ha.Â« ever been made.
j This section of the valley is steaailv pro-
I year by year in the production of
I citrus fruiis. I am surprised and Ju.l of
admiration at the quality. Southern
Caliiornia cannot raise any better oranges
or lemons. Sonoma County should be
proud of the exhibit. The pavilion is
nlso a great credit to Cioverdalr." Gen
| eral Passenger Agent R. X. Ryan of the
I railroad company also expressed his ad
j miration and v U rpr se at the excellence of
I the citrus exhibit.
i A conference was held this evenine by
I the executive committee of the fair and
General Passenger Agent Ryan. It was
agreed that to-day's excursion from Santa
Rosa, Petaluma, Heakisourg and inter
vening towns should be duplicated next
Monday at the same rate of $1 for t.'ie
round trip from tne two first named cities
and 50 cents Irora Healisburg. This was
done owing to the inclement weather to
day.
To-night one of the numbers of the
musical programme by the Cloverdale
cornet band Â»a< entitled, "And the Next
Day It Snowed."
John Conner of Cloverdale presided,
and made tbe opening speech, and told the
story of the resources of tbe vahey a; dis
played above, below and around the hiil.
Mr. Comber introduced the principal
speaker of the evening, R. A. Thompson
editor of the Santa Rosa Democrat.
Mr.Thompson's subject was, "Tiie Evo
lution of Agriculture in Sonoma County."
The address was largely historical, begin
ning with Padre Altimira, the first Cali
fornian to settle in Sonoma, though he
was not the first Sonoma County farmer,
the Russians havine preceded him at
Bodega.
"W'lien there was no other agricultural
gift to bestow upon Sonoma, Cloverdale
crowned its produces with citrus fruits "
s,am the speaker. "The trees were first
planted because they were ornamental.
This gave nature her opportunity; she
did the rest.
"j. A. Kleiser, an honored pioneer, still
amonsusand here Jo-cay, purchased in
Ban Francisco in 1860 an orange plant for
wbich he paid $5. He set it out on the
present Captain Field place. It was after
ward moved to the Bowman grounds. It
is now thirty-four years old ani is in
full bearing. Other scattering trees were
planted in the town after this and all
flourished. Captain John Field was not
the first to plant orange?, but be was the
tirot to plant, them for profit. It was a
success, M. Memnan was not much be
hind Captain Field, and now has a highly
productive orange grove on a lot adjoin
in/ his t.otel.
"In 18'J3 the display of trees laden with
fruit was so conspicuous that it occurred
to a number of citizens to have a citrus
lair. Colonel James B. Armstrong, who
was always an ardent lover of nature and
its product!), a brilliant writer on the
agricultural development of the State,
was especially inte^e-ted. He was enthu
siastic. An association was formed, of
which Colonel Armstrong was made presi
dent, W. T. Brush vice-presiaent and G.
H. Baer secretary. The directors were
Captain John Field, Louis HolJoway, I.
E. Shaw and T. B. Wilson (ruana er).
Behind the directorate were a number of
ladies without wiroin there is no success
in such work. Amone these were: Mrs.
J. A. Kleiser. Mrs. I. E. Shaw, Mrs. W. T.
Brush. Mrs. H. Larrab c, Mrs. Louis
Holioway, Mrs. Jonn Field. Mrs. H.
Gerkhardt, the Misses Lance. Miss Larra
bee, Miss Marshall, Miss Dominie and
Miss Minnie Potter.
"The lair took place on the Ist, 2d and 3 i
of February, 1893. It was a great success.
The people of the btata, county and even
ft Cloverdaie were astonished at the
progress that iad been made. Il greatly
stimulated the planting of citrus fruits.
'The results uf that fair are before you
to-day â not only in the iruits exhibited,
bu: also in this splendid building in
which they are displayed. This leads up
to tbe building and its construction,
vr:iicb is also an outcome of tbe fair of
1893. Most of the organizers of that fair
were promoters of the pavilion scheme of
1896. How could it help beine a success?
Tner<? were Captain John Field, who

NOT TO BE BRIBED.
The Governor of Washington Springs a
Sensation in the Case of Henry
Craemer.
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 18.â Governor
Rogers sprung v btnsation to-day by giv
ing out correspondence tending to show
that 0. F. Wegemr, the alleged friend of
H^nry Craenier, me murderer who is
doomed to be hanged in a few weeks, has
been raising thousands of dollars in the
East, presumably for the purpose of brib
ing Rogers to grant Ciaeraer a pardon.
Wegener has for three years past been
taKir.g an interest in Craemer's behalf.
He worked the Germans of California into
a -ever of excitement by telling them
through the papers and by private corre
spondence that Craemer is innocent and
that only one thing could save him â
money. It is claimed h? raised several
thousand at the time. Similar letters
were sent to Germans in other parts of the
United States.
That was before Governor Rogers took
offiie. Once again Wegener has flooded
the country with circulars asking the Ger
man citizens lor money wherewith to save
the neck of Craemer, who has been repre
sented as an innocent man but the victim
of ma. ice and prejudice and a man who is
being politically held in jeopardy by ot
fice-holding bandits, to be released fora
ransom. Wepeuer has charged the Supe
rior Court Judge* ana the Supreme Court
Judges with corruption, and now he im
plicates the Governor of the State.
It appears that Wegener has secured
$2000 from the State of Texas alone and is
asking for more money, declaring thai if
"lots" of money is immediately sent the
Governor can be persuaded so pardon the
condemned man; but above all, "more
money" is absolutely needed. Wegener
has all along claimed that he can ; rove
Craeme-'s innocence, because a certain
'â¢Jack Quincy," if he could be produced,
would swear mat Craemer was in Tacoma
on the day of the murder, and thus estab
lish an alibi.
In the East Wepener has been telling a
d fferent story. He claims the "fanati
cism" of the people ot Seattle about cor
rupt public officials is responsible for
Craemer's position, and he points out that
the rondemned man can only be saved by
German* throughout '.he country sfiiuuig
in ai. the money that can be bpared. To
such ends ha a Wegener pressed his claims
that certain Germans of the Middle States
have begun to doubt his btory, and one of
them, William Webber, editor of the
Kiieger Zeitung, pabished at Belleville,
ill., Uas written to Governor Rogers con
cerning Wegener and his methods. Gov
ernor Rogeis gave out the letter to-day,
which read in part as follow-:
"My own position is strictly neutral. I
do not wish to barm an innocent man,
nor do 1 desire to countenance swindle
and immoderate attacks upon the iustice
of our court!Â«."
Governor Rogers' private secretary has
written Wegener a letter, in which he
says:
"Governor Rogers directs me to inform
you that he is in receipt of a communica
tion from William Webber, editor of a
German paper published at Belleville. 111.,
laying that you had written appeals to the
German papers throughout the United
States for funds to be used in securing the
pardon of Mr. Craemer with the implica
tion that th- se funds are to Le applied in a
corrupt manner. The Governor desires
to Â»ay that if you have given out such an
impression you have done him a great in
justice. It is not the Governor's intention
to inter/ere in any case where application
for pardon does not prove conclusively
that the person convicted was really innu
cent of the crime charged against him.
The evidence in Mr. Crammer's case is very
damaging to him. The Governor has said
emphatically that he will not pardon Mr.
Craemer. He now reiterates it."
STOCK TOM'S OLDEST WOMAN DIES.
"Aunt/c " King, Wto Had Passed the Cen
tury Mark, Found Expiring in
Her Yard.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 18.â Registrar
Eckstrom of the Associated Charities
yesterday went to the house of oid
"Auntie" King, an aged colored woman
who had beer, dependent upon public
charity for a number of years. Mr. Eck
strom could not arouse anybody by knock
ing and so he entered the dwelling, which
is located at 106 West Jackson street.
The house was empty, but what appeared
to be a newly started tire burned in the
kiichen stove. Mr. Eckstrom went into
the back yard, expecting to find old
"Auntie" King at Hie pump which is lo
cated there. He did find her there, but she
was aimo'-t lifeless and expired soon after
ward. Sbe lay nearly hidden in tall gras*.
and had not the registrar chanced alone
just when he did she would probably have
died in the yard and her body miL'ht have
lain there hidden for days in the tall grays.
The old lady claimed to be 106 years old,
but her friends say that she was not
nearly so aped as she imagined. She was,
however, far past the meridian of life.
She had been eccentric with age for many
years and her chief dread in life was the
County Hospital. She would nevor go
thera.

STREETCAR FARES
WILL NOT BE CUT
Braunhart's Bill Fails of
Final Passage in the
Senate.
The Measure Provokes One of
the Most Interesting Debates
of the Session.
S x Members Favor and Thirty-Three
Record Their Votes Against
Its Passage.
SACKAMENTO, Cal., Feb. IS.âStreet
car fares in !?an Francisco will not be re
duced at this session of the Legislature.
Braunhart's much-discussed and equally
much-amended bill failed of final passage
in the Senate this morning by an over
whelming vote, and none of its friends
saw even enough hope ahead to warrant a
change of vote and a notice of reconsider
ation, to it is as dead as liickens' door
nail.
It provoked one of the warmest and
most interesting debates of tne session,
and evoked what was one of the highest
individual oratorical displays since the
disposition of the United States Senatorial
question. To Senator Wolfe of San Fran
cisco fell the honor of >peaker eloquent
He took up the gauge of battle against the
measure immediately on the close of
Braunhart's opening argument, and
though he occupied but a fraction of the
lime of nis predecessor he had the sym
pathy of house and lobby with him when
he resumed his seat.
Withington, Mahoney, Morehouse,
Smith and Bert came to Wolfe's support,
while Braunhart had the distinction of
being the sole champion of the ill-lated
measure.
The measure, which provides for a re
duction of streetcar fares from 5 cents
each to eight for 25 cents, was the first
on the third-reading rile this morning. It
had passed the scrutiny of the Committee
on Corporations and the San Francisco
delegation, and the adverse report of the
Committee on Rules and Revision, sub
mitted this morning, was theretors in the
nature of a bombshell to the author of
the measure. The bill was declared by
tins report to be unconstitutional.
Braunhart saw all his hopes and ambi
tions shattered in this new turn of affair?,
and his bitter disappointment found vent
in strong denunciation, though on strictly
parliamentary lines, of the members of
the offending committee. Withington,
the chairman of that committee, and
Dicfcinson were especially singled out by
the irate Senator. He severely criticized
the action of Withington in withholding
an adverse report until the last moment,
and declared that the opinion of two or
dinary lawyers (referring to the Senators
from Mann and San Diego, respectively)
had little weight with him as to the con
stitutionality of a bill. He charged that
similar measures had been passed by the
Senate and had been voted for by the
Senators mentioned.
Braunhart cited facts and figures which
he claimed showed that the street rail
ways, and especially the Market-street
Company, could stand the reduction con
templated. Pretended Jnends of the
measure, tie charged, had stabbed it in the
back, and efforts had been made to kill it
in committee. He declared that while
not one of the hundreds of thousands of
men, women and children who wou'd be
benefited by the passage of this bill had
been -ent here to i-namrion their cause,
the coupon-clipper, the stock-jobber and
the Lenenciary of watered stock had been
here to "browbeat and intimidate," and
t.Mat fake petition?" and meetings of clubs
had b6en called 10 the attention of com
mittees to influence them against the
measure. He made light of the opposi
tion of the railroad employes, and asserted
that their fears of reductions in salaries
were unfounded, judging from past ex
periments of this kind in other cities.
Senator Wolfe began by statinjj mat be
would refrain from discussing the matter
from a constitutional standpoint and con
tinued :
"I shall not attempt to re;>ly to the slurs
and sneers of ray colleague. We ought to
be honest in our views upon questions
presented to us. 1 want to say that no -
withstanding all the gentleman has said,
I rise in opposition to this measure.
"The gentleman has magnified the im
portance of this proposition. You would
think alter listening to him that bun
Francisco had risen en masse in favor of
this bill â that the men and women and
children were standing upon the high
ways and byway* waiting lor this Senate
to come to their relief and pass the
Braunhart 2) j-cent bill.
"1 have no telegrams in my possession
asking for the passage of this measure. 1
have not been even spoken to by any one
in reference to this measure, except by
those men who are here to-day â those
men to whom the Senator sneeringly al
luded to as "thesie gripmen and conduct
or?.' 1 have been spoken to by these men,
and I say that I will submit to their judg
ment. I will place their intelligence side
by side with that of the gentleman who
has just taken his seat. I will take their
judgment and word in preference to his
unsupported statement on the floor of the
Sen:tie.
"These 'few griprnen and conductors'
who receive The 'high wuiies' of $2 50 per
day represent 4000 ur 5000 in San Fran
cisco, who by tnelr earnings upon the
streetcars raise families and educate their
children. These few men represent as in
telligent ana hard-workins: a class of la
boring men as can be found in any city of
the world.
'They came here in opposition to that
bill, and the only message that has been
sent to me is the message that the gentle
man al9O received. That was a petition,
signed by over 3000 of Uiese men, protest
ing against the measure. In the di-trict
which I have the honor to represent there
reside between 600 and 700 of these men,
ana four or five railways have their
termini In my district. Upon the petition
here to-day are the eignatures of 500 or
600 of my constituents asking me to op
pose this measure, and I support their
views without fear of the danger of being
misconstrued in ban Francisco.
"My belief is that t is bill is in the
direct interest of the Market-street rail
road and that no other railroad will bene
fit from it. The remaining street railroads
in San Francisco that are now indepen
dent and competing lines will be wiped
out. These will be absorbed by the Mar
ket-street Railway Company. It means
further than that, and I base my asser
tions upon the judpment of these men
who represent organized labor. I think
that the result of this will be to reduce
their wages. They believe it and I believe
it with tnem, and therefore I am opposed
to this measure.
"I have spoken lately, while to San
Francisco, to all classes of people, and
they were not people who hold stock in
any of the street railroad corporations,
and I found the almost unanimous senti
ment among the laboring man and the
business men to be opposed to this meas
ure, and I nm going to take tneir judg
ment and view upon this matter without
considering tbose of the distinguished
Senator wno has just preceded me."
He declared that the h-utro and Presidio
roads would be compelled to fro oat of
business, and that this w*a an attempt to
slap at the Market-street road let it hurt
whomever it may. In conclusion he said:
"I hope the Senators will not be carried
away by the style of argument indulged
by the gentleman. The measure is not
one that is in demand by the people of
San Francisco. Those who live in the
crowded districts of San Francisco are not
the ones" who u*e the streetcars. The
crowded districts are where the laboring
classes reside, and these crowded districts
are easy of access to the places where
these people are employed. 1 hope this
measure will be defeated."
Withington attempted to point out the
unconstitutionally of the measure, de
claring it was special legislation in favor
of the people of San Francisco.
-Mationey presented the petition of the
San Francisco streetcar employes protest
ing against the passage of the bill.
Morehouse denounced too measure as
an attempt to regulate fares without an
effort having been mad.* to determine
whether they would be just and lair.
"This legislation," he sai.i, "i* intended
to Dreak down the streetcar system of San
Francisco and injure the suburban resi
dents by compelling the railroad-* which
they now patronize to go out of tuisiness.
"What is this bill!" he exclaimed. "It
should be headed entirely differentâ a bill
to enable some gentleman to iiave an op
portunity to hear the gallery bark when
he attacks the railroad corporations. He
stands here against the signed petition of
thousands of railroad employes.
"I am satisfied," he concluded, with
great vehemence, "that the intelligence,
the honesty, the uprightness of this Sen
ate cannot indorse so luminous and con
temptible a piece of legation as intro
duced by t::e gentleman from San Fran
cisco."
Smith said be thought the bill was a
proper one and that lie would be pleased
to vote for it, but there was nothing in
evidence to show that the proposed re
duction was fair and justified.
Bert stated that ha coincided with the
views of Wolfe and would vole against the
bili. .
Braunhart in closing denied that the
measure was directed against tbe Market
street Company in any spirit of vindic
tiveness. In conclusion lie said: "The
battle has just begun. This is but a mere
skirmish on behalf of th - people and tbe
masses. The day will come when the
corporations will be made to bow to the
will of the people."
Wolfe, in a sort of amen" tone, arose
and lesponded: "1 hope that day will
soon come," and the debate was over.
The bill was defeated by a vote of 6 ayes
to S3 noes, Liuder alone being absent.
Those voting with Braunhart were:
Dwyer, Hall. La Rue, Seawell and Toner.
Braunhart was nearly heartbroken over
his defeat.

Its Supporters Confident That It

Blue aud God Adrrn the Capitol in
H r nor of the University's
V.ctory.
SACRAMÂ£NTO, Cal.. Feb. 18.âSena
tors, Assemblymen, State officers, news-
I aper men, legislative attaches, pages,
lobbyists, and in fact nearly every one â
ladies included â about the spacious Capi
tol building, sported the colors of the Uni
versity of California to-day in honor of
the passage through the Senate of the bill
giving that institution the increased rev
enue to be derived from an additional I
cent taxation.* The bill has already passed
the Assembly, and is said to be certain of
the npDroval of the Governor. Blue and
gold not only hung from the lapels of
nearly every individual, but the desks of
the President of the Senate and of the
Speaker of tbe House were decorated with
ribbons of the same hue.
So jubilant were the repressntatives of
the university who are here, and who
aided in gaining the victory for tbe insti
tution, that they exhausted the local
market of its supply of blue and yellow
ribbons in the desire to spread in their
unique way the good news.
It is a matter of deepest gratification to
the university that this measure has been
passed, and the news probably came with
added welcome to Professor Le Conte, who
to-day celebrated his golden wedding an
niversary at the Mart Hopkins Institute
of Art. It will lorever obviate the un
pleasant necessity of the regents and the
faculty of the institution going before the
Legislature as supplicants or maintaining
a lobby at the Capitol. Among the
strongest supporters of the measure were
Senator Stratton and Assemblyman
Wright, both of Alameda County.
At the present time the annual income
of the university is about $175,000. Of this
$50,000 comes from private endowments,
and the additional 1 cent will increase
this total to $300,000 jer annum. Of this
amount about $60,000 will be set aside for
ten years as a building fund, and there
will, therefore, at the end of that period be
$600,000 at the disposal of the university
f t the construction of new buildings.
The remainder of the extra appropriation
will be applied to improving the present
accommodations ot the students and in
increasing the uumber of instructors.

great rejoicing at the State University

the measure known as the Wright bill had

reason haJ they to be glad, for when the

new era for the university.
INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.
Reforms Proposed by the Populists Are
Discussed by the Members of
the Assembly.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 18.âPopu
lism, socialism and the little Swiss Repub
lic had their field day in the Assembly
this morning. Danton Dryden, Marat
McClelUn and Robespierre Landsborougn,
assisted by Citizens CartwrightandToland
and the Chevalier Cutter from the historic
dam of the Yuba, concentrated their
forces upon Louis Philippe Dibble, and ior
an hour the Assembly Chamber re
sounded with debate on a matter, not of
partisans ip, but on an issue overturning
the corner-stone of the Bute Government.
The subject was three constitutional
amendmentsâ Nos. 1, 2 and 3 â introduced
by Dryden of San Diego, their purpose be
ing to introduce into the governmental
system the initiative and " referendum.
Amendment No. 1 provides that when
ever 20 per cent of the voters of the State
shall petition the Governor to submit to
the people any amendment to the consti
tution of the State the Governor must ad
vertise the same at least 40 days before a
general election, and the amendment must
be voted on by the people.
After ratification by the people no power
can reverse their judgment or do away
with the amendment, unless by the same
means by which it was adopted, namely,
a vote of the people.
Constitutional amendment No. 2 pre
cribes a 20 per cent petition to the Legis
lature on laws and statutes which the
petitioners desire submitted to the peo
ple. No. 3 provides that ordinances, or
ders, etc., of Boards of County Sup r
visors and City Councilmen must be sub
mitted to the people in like manner on a
20 per cent petition.
Dryden made a lenethy speech on the
amendments. Their adoption, he said,
would putify politics and be a relief to the
people, who were too olten misrepresented
by tbeir representatives and tco often at
the mercy of powerful and unscrupulous
corporations.
Dibble of Sao Francisco characterized
the amendments as a proposal to revolu
tionise the present system Â©i government
ana wipe out the constitution. The meas
ure was a condemnation of the men who
bad framed constitutions in every State in
the Union, and was a condemnation also
of constitutional government as it now
existed i:i all parts of the world except in
one of the cantons of Switzerland. It
was one of the most revolutionary nnd
dangerous proposals thatcouid be brought
to the attention of a legislative body.
Dibbie added that he did not believe
that a democracy was curable of govern
in^ itself except by a ripies.entative sys
tem, and tiiat not even the wisest people
on the face of the earth have the power to
frame laws in assemblages except by the
representative system. He could not con
ceive how tuo^e three amendments could
result in anything less than confusion and
disaster. Nothing less could come from
the adoption into the governmental sys
tem of the initiative and referendum.
During the present session the members
bad had one of the most striking illustra
tions of the wonhiessness of government
by petition. Every member of tne Assem
bly had signed petition after petition un
til the tbing had become nauseating.
He could go into any district in the
State to-morrow and could pel a petition
signed by 20 t>er cent of the voters to hang
any man in California. He cnusd go into
the saloons, the slums and the byways
and pet 20 per c-nt of the voters to sign
petitions for anything.
The assertion of Mr. Dryden that after
the Legislature adjourned ttie people con
demned the statutes that had been
adopted, Mr. Dibble termed unfounded.
On the contrary, no really bad laws had
been passed by ihe Legislature of the State
of California. It was really wonderful to
tind how few bad measures had slipped
through the Legislature. '
"I know that our politics neel reforma
tion," added Mr. D.bble. "I know tiiat
many men elected ts representatives aro
not just to the people; I know that there is
corruption in our politics; but the remedy
is not to destroy the work of Washington,
Jefferson and Adams, but to reform our
politics by becinning at the primary elec
tions and building up and sustaining the
American system of government by politi
cal parties. It is to give to the people a
good primary election law. Our present
system is the best system of government
that the sun has ever shone upon."
McClellan (Populist) from Kinsjs County
arose to reply. He is a tall, well-built
man, with a dark beard und a good voice,
and displayed himself to more advantage
than he had ever ifone before during the
present session. He began in a sarcastic
vein, when he remarked that it seemed to
him from the argument by Mr. Dibble
that all the intelligence and" morality in
the State of California were to be found
within the four walls of this Legislature.
Without intending to make any personal
r< flections upon his fellow-members of the
Assembly he said they must admit that
the history of the last four weeks' session
made Mr. Dibble's statement a very severe
reflection upon the people of California.
He went on:
"I believe that any government that has
ever met with success, or ever will meet
with success, will derive its powers irora
the governed. Whenever the people have
been given the privilege of making known
their choice upon any question, that
choice has been wise and well taken, as in
the case of tbe adoption of the new con
stitution. That is one way in which im
portant matters may be brought before
tue people devoid of partisanship. Under
caucus rule tbe man placed before the peo
ple for their suffrage is not â four times
out of five â the choice of the people."
Toland of Ventura made a speech which
demonstrated that when a man is talking
upon some broad principle, which ha be
lieves in, he can do much botter than
when helping place-hunting Democrats
to filibuster and obstruct legislation. He
began by asking why the people couid
make constitutions and not unmake them.
"When we consider the canJidatcs put
forth as the choice of tne people," he said,
"and the means by which they become
the so-called choice of the people â some
times by false pretensesâ we find that they
come to the balls of legi.-iation represent
ing their own private Interests. In the
making of statutes they lepresont other
interests than those of the people at large.
When we look, over the whole field and
see bow legislation is done, when we see
tiow that hash called law is compounded,
I think that the remark of Mr. Dibble that
this substituting the individual will for
the will of the people making laws is a
ridiculous proposition. How do you >;et
to me masses of the people except by ask
ing the individuals of the people to vote
upon the proposition? No harm can ever
come from the direct submis-ionofthe.se
laws of general operation and letting the
people pass upon them.
"I believe also that when once the peo
ple have passed upon a law no Legisla
tureâno power on carth â should be
allowed to reverse that solemn verdict of
the people unless by the same meaus by
which it had been made â namely, the
vote of the people."
Cartwright (Fusionlst) from .Fresno ad
vanced some radical ideas, lie said thai,
Washington, Jefferson and Adams lived a
long time aco, and it was now proposed to
improve upon their plans. The plan was
not revolutionary.
"We will still continuo to elect men to
represent us in the Senate and Assembly,
but we reserve the rigut to compel them
to refer their acts back to us for our deci
sion. I believe that the adoption of this
resolution would absolutely prevent all
corrupt influences in legislative matters.
No man would be willing to lobby any
measure through this Assembly when he
would afterward have 10 go back to the
people and lobby it there alÂ«o.
''The gentleman from San Francisco saye
it will revolutionize this Government. I
hope to God it will, for there is not a Gov
ernment on the face of the earth where
misery and want are more prevalent than
under this. The gentleman classes the
men who advocate this measure as dema
gogue?, but I say that there nerer was a
man in the world who was not a dema
gogue on tirst presenting a reform. The
heterodoxy of to-day becomes ihe ortho
doiv of fo-morrow. I despise that con
servatism whirh clings to the old things
until the o!d things become rotten.
"Wendell Phillips said that no reform
ever came from the upper classes of the
people. ThiÂ» is an age of progress, of in
ventions in mechanics and diacoveriea in
science that revolutioniz9 all our indus
tries, and those changes have brought
changes in the people, and the-e demand
as radical changes in government."
LandaborougE of Sacramento followed
in a similar vein. On motion of Cart
wright, seconded by Cutter, the amend
ments were amended by requiring the pe
titions to be signed by 30 per cent of the
voters instead of 20 percent. The amend
ments were read a eecond time and sent
to the printer.

Quarter of a Century Ago. It Will Ec the Home of Over a
Hundred Parentless Little Boys.
largo number of sick children to be cared
for at the Ban Mateo home, the present
situation is one that appeals to thoss who
know the facts.
There are eighty boys now living in the
new quarters. They were transferred a
week aeo from the orphanage at San
Mateo. Workmen are still busily en
gaged in adapting the house to its new
occupants, but by the end of another
week the necessary fire escapes and the
additional stairways and partitions will
have been completed and the exterior of
the building repainted.
The house was built many years ago for
a fashionable boarding- place. It was
lint called The Marlborougb, and by that
name was tbe synonym a quarter of a
century ago for gentility among the
higher class boardine-houses of the City.
In later years it was known as The Belve
dere, and latterly was used as a cheap
rooming-houae.
It is well adapted to the use to which it
is henceforth to be put. Wilh sixty-two
rooms and many outside windows open
ing on two streets, it can accommodate as
many as 150 boys.
Tbe building is to be used as a home for
the little ones and as an Orphanage Home
for those boys who have attained the age
of 11 and are at work in the City.
Tbe Orphans.cc Home will have its en
trance on Second streat and will be a dis
tinct institution, kept so by means bf par
titions dividing the buildings into two
parts. For some little time past the home
for these older boys has been at 831 Fulton
street. When it was first organized in
November, ISOS, it was situated at 709
Powell street. The idea of such a home is
to care for the young boys and to help
them along on their meager wages untii
t..ey are better able to struggle alone for
a livelihood.
The State allows $75 a year for the
maintenance of a half orphan and $100 a
year for that of a full orphan. This State
aid in the aggregate pays a large part of
tbe running expenses of the institution.
But there would be a big annual deficit
were nothing forthcoming from churches
and individuals.
There are 178 orphans in the Armitage
to-day, not including the nineteen work
ing boys past the age of 14, who are liv
ing at the Orphanage Home.
From the State the Armitage gets
about $10,000 a year; from private and
church subscriptions about $8000 more.
All of this is required for expenses
Last year through & decision of the Su
preme Court the orphanage, because it
was situated in San Mateo, was declared
inellcible to a legacy of $10,000 as a San
Francisco charitable institution, thougo
its offices are here and 75 per cent of the
orphans are from San Fraucisco.
The children in the new home go to the
neighboring public schools and the kinder
garten during the day. In the early morn
ing they help about the housework and in
the cv- ning they prepare their lessons for
the next day. Otherwise they have noth
ing to do.
To aid this worthy work a theatrical en
tertainment will be given at the California
on Monday evening. March 1.
The play will be "Caste," Tom Robert
son's charming comedy. The principal
actors will be M.ss Leila Burton, daughter
of Captain Burton of the Presidio; Miss
Rose Hooper, daughter of Major Hoonpr
of tne Occidental; Miss Robeson, and j.
C. WiJson Jr., Seiden Stuart, Charles Dick
man and Frank Norris, familiar faces i-i

NOT PAETED JN DEATH.
Julien -VI .it hi i- n and Hit Wife Marianue
Were liuried logethur.
In life they were tender and true to each
other ana as if loath to leave one to
mourn the other's departure the dread
reaper's sickle tovered their cords of life
at nearly the same time.
That expresses succinctly the life and
death history of Julien Mathieu, aged 73,
and his wife, Marianne, aged G9.
Juliea Maihieuand hiÃ wile Uved at 2420
Buchanan street. They were English by
birth and had been married for thirty-five
years. Many years ago they came to Napa
City, where "Mathieu was cashier of the
Napa Bank.
About eighteen or twenty years ago they
came to this City so that their boys could
enjoy better facilities for securing an edu
cation. Since that time they have re
mained here.
Four years ago the husband was stricken
with loeomoter ataxia, and last Sunday
! evening the old man died. Marianne, the
wife, who hod been constantly by his bed
side up to a lew days prior to his death, had
fallen ill with pneumonia. When her
husband died the news was carefully kept
from her.
Tuesday morning the relatives and
friends of the deceased husband and
j father gathered %t St. Luke's Episcopal
j Church to hear the burial sprvice read by
{ Rev. Dr. W. H. Moreland. When the
service was over the casket was returned
to Gray Bros.' undertaking establishment.
The tirst news that greeted those cross
! ing the threshold on their way home from
the funeral was that the mother had died.
She had joined her husband while the
] burial service was in progress. WednesÂ«
! day morning service over her remains was
performed at St. Luke's, and the cortege
proceeded to Cypress Lawn Cemetery on
the electric cars, where the husband's
body had been taken and laid in the
{ chapel.
Then they were tenderly carried by the
! pallbearers and reposed in the grave side
by side.
INTERSTATE COURSING.
Hounds From East and West Will
Contest lor Handsome
Prizes.
The Drawing Ii by Far Much the
Largest That Has Evar Taken
Placa in Thij City.
The Interstate Cam-sing Club will give a
two days' meeting at Ingleside park, com
mencing on Sunday and ending on Mon
day. The owners of fast running grey
hounds in parts of the State where cours
ing is iudulejed in as a means of sport
have promised to be represented at the
meeting, in person or by proxy. Several
dogs from the kennels of StocKton, Mer
ced, San Jose, Sacramento, Petaluma,
Valle jo and Los Angeies will be included
among the entries and it goes witeout
saying that the wise guessers will have a
merry time calling the winner of the cud
in the old dog slake. The drawing took
place last evening at Delta Hall, on Mar
ket strtet, and a most enthusiastic gather
ing of spor tsmen was present.
Thia will be the second annual contest
for the John Grace cup ana tirst i.rize,
which amounts to |300 in cash. Last year
the cup was won by Robinson and Pav
ton s dog Fearnot, and, as tne same canine
Is entered again, its owners seemin-ly <io
not fear the result notwithstanding that
the speedy animal will face the warmest
kind of company on this occasion.
Some oJ the Eastern dogs that will enter
the slips are said to b* fivers, and it would
not surprise the talent to see an Eastern
â¢printer cutting down the Shamrocks on
tne lng.ies.de coursing sward in the final
round oi the great annual meeting.
Tommy Hall, prince of the Merced cours
ing lraternity, will have three "lightning
strikers" in the old dog stake, aud as
lomray is a keen observer his judgment
on coursing matters is always sought after
by those who fancy having a little of the
lon* green on the general result. Be
sides Fearnot, Robinson and Peyton will
have Royal Buck, Flying Buck and toas
ter Glenkirk represented m the racÂ«S for
the cup.
Rosseter and Baxtel will enter Emm
Fasha, Wayfarer, Ben Hur and Brandon
â Bell, all of which dogrs represent the pur
est blood of greyhound stock.
Devine of Sacramento will nave a first
class dog in the all age stake, alsrÂ» one in
the sapling and puppy stakes. Spring of
ban Jose is of tne opinion that the cup
will go to the Garden City this time, as he
has a cracker- jack which he says cannot
be defeated by any stock. Curtis of San
Jose has also a good doa in tne held.
Healy of Petaluma has two grand dogs
Which arointhe pink of condition; he
will be a most disappointed man if one of
the number is not in witt the "flyerb" in
the final ties.
Grace and Dpan will have two graÂ«3
cuiteis in the big stake from whom much
is expected. In fact, only dogs that have
been thoroughly tried out md found to be
top notcbers, will run in the big stake,
consequently the cour-ing should be the
best that has been wiuiessec at Inglesida
park in many days.
The all-ape stake cup was presented to
the club last year by the wÂ«ll-known
judge John Grace, and thÂ» conditions
that will govern the contests of Sunday
and Monday are the same as those of last
year. The cup will remain the property of
the club until it is won three 'imes by a
doa or dogs representing the sane kennel.
A gentleman who is well and favorably
known to the coursing people o! this City
has presented the club with a aandsome
cup, valued at $150, which will be com
peted for by the sapiine* only and under
the same conditions as govern tte all-age
cup. The cup is to be named after the
winning dog at the comin .- meeting.
If the hares will prove to be as good
runners as me managers of the park
states then the sportsmen can count
upon seeing the Â£,raas fly on Sunday and
Monday.
The Interstate Club will give a dinnÂ«r
to the coursing people of this City and
State on Saturday evening. The invita
tions read as follows:
The annual dinner of the Interstate Cours
ing Club will be neld at 317 Pine street, next
Saturday evening, commencing at 8:30
o'clock.
You are expected to be present and assist
the committee in making this a most success
iul and enjoyable affair. "We want you. ma
honey, yea, we do." Don't miss it or you'll bo
sorry by-and-by.
There'll be feasting, toasting, singing and
"doggie talk" to no end. If you can assist in
any way you must come prepared, for "we'll
call you."
After the card has been called you will havo
an opportunity of "saying" who'll win tha
cupâ a la "long shot."

CONVICT LABOR BILL.
Manufacturers' Association Trying to
Abolish Machinery in Prisons.
A majority of the directors of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association on
Tuesday came to the conclusion that the
use of power machinery in the State
prisons is a curse rather than a benefit to
humanity, as ;by its use many worthy
free men are deprived of the means of
making a living. It was decided to frame
a bill to prohibit tbe use of power machin
ery in the prisons of the State and ask tbe
Legislature to make it a law. Wednesday
the committee â D. rectors Kerr, Jacobs
and Keller â met ana framed the following
bill, which Manager Lewis took to Sacra
mento in tbe evening:
The people of the State of California, reprt
seated iv Senate and Assembly, do enact aÂ»
follows:

FRIDAY FEBRUARY 19. 1897 j
THE FARE AM THE FACT.
THE PAKE
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of Its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
5964 More |
Than were publishftl by any \
other San Francisco Newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner \
was probably not aware that a careful record was ]
being kept of the actual amount in Inches of Its ,
advertising and that in consequence It could be
confronted with the following fact.
â THE FACT
THE EXAMINER PUELISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During J896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during 1896.
It Is to be remembered that daring IS9StnÂ«
Examiner published approximate'? 800 Inches of
illegal lottery advertisements, or which Tint Call
did not and would not publish one.
Ihemonarca of the falters bun doubtless suc-
ceeded '.Â» pecuring thousands of inches of adver- {
tising during the pa.it year by duping and deceiv-
ing advertisers through false and arrogant asser-
tions of the cnaracter of the foregoing fake. It
would seem, however, from ti.e facts that the
merchants as a. rule have not been misled by its
lrnudulent pretenses.
he Examiner boasts that its books are open to
Inspection, but we suggest that It Inspect Its own
looks before it ventures UDOn the publication of
another fake.
AY's congratulate the public on the fact that the
t-xrosure of this fake led the Examiner to drop it.
In this the Examiner was discreet, and If It Is wise
It will make no more snrli bold attempts to
i'erÂ»"ivÂ» the public
Work for the workers.
Let us attend to the unemployed.
It is safer to brag on this kind of
weather than to bet on it.
Don't forget that the unemployed are
asking for work and not for charity.
It will take fire and a hot iron to take
Greece off the Cretan issue this time.
As a sign of fair weather the seagull is
decidedly as deceptive as any other gull.
It has been a very warm winter for the
trusts, and those that haven't busted are
getting roasted.
The great powers will try the policy of
coercion on Crete to see how it works be
fore they apply it to Turkey.
Wherever there is a printing-press there
is trouble, and even the State cannot have
the one without getting the other.
The immigration bill has passed Con
gress and gone to Grover, which we fear is
equivalent to saying it has gone to veto.
To open the boulevard from the park to
the ocean drive would be making way for
pleasure and for work at the same time.
Greece has offerea to fight for Crete,
atid as that is the highest bid yet made
it ought to be knocked down to her and
the s-quabble ended.
If there should be a war in the Levant
to shut off Russian wheat and Turkish
primes and ligs we would have some
reason to regard it as a good thing and
push it along.
Compared with other large cities of the
Union Snn Francisco has comparatively
few cali!> for charity end therefore ought
to be the more willing to respond tore
quests for work.
The Democratic press in default of find
ing any other defects in the McKinley
Cabinet are clamoring loudly that L,yman
Gaee wears a wig and seem determined to
snatch him bald-headed.
There will be no campaign of education
needed on the Cuban question. The
people have long since made up their
minds In favor of the independence of the
island and are now ready to express it.
About the last thing San Francisco will
ask of the Legislature will be a specialist
in sociological education. There are
plenty of people in the City who will vol
unteer instruction on that subject at any
time.
The Cuban committee appointed by
Mayor Phefan is composed of exactly the
right men for the place. They can be
counted on to do whatever is best to ad
vance the cause, and the people can safely
trust in them.
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
The Cuban committee appointed by Mayor Phelan to co-operate with similar
committees in other cities of the Union is in every respect a good one. It is com
posed of men who represent the real sentiments of tne people or San .Francisco on the
great issue, and will ably serve to give to the cause of CuOau independence the moral
support of our people.
By general consent the direction of the work of all these combined committees
j will be given to the great committee appointed In New York City. It is altogether
I right and proper that this should be so. New York is the metropolis of America, it
j is the headquarters of the Cuban Junta, and-thc citizens' committee there was the first
lin the field. For these reasons it is natural that committees in other cities should
look to New York for guidance and leadership in the important work which they
have undertaken.
The Cuban cause is one of those which Lord Bacon described as appealing to "the
bosoms and the business of men." it involves the issues ot the liberty of an Ameri
can people and the independence of an American country, and therefore excites the
responsive sympathies of all true. Americans. It also involves valuable property
owned by Americans in the island and the lnrge trade which, in times of peace, is
carried on between our country and the Cubans. The United States has, therefore 1
pecuniary and selfish interests, as well as American and unselfish ones, at stake in the
contest.
To the people of California the question is largely ana mainly one of patriotic sen
timent. We have little or no trade with the island of Cuba. On the contiary much
of the produce she exports to &ew York under normal conditions comes into compe
tition with our own produce. We are something more than disinterested in the quar
rel, for there might be some monetary advantage to us if the war were prolonged. It
is significant, therefore, of the strength of genuine Americanism in our people that
we rise superior to commercial consideration and cordially co-operate with the people
of New York in lending every legitimate and justifiable aid to the Cuban patriots who
are struggling for the independence of their country.
It is in the hignest degree gratifying to note that public sentiment is in hearty
accord with the movement which has been so auspiciously inaugurated by The Call
and supported by Mayor Plielan in the appointment of this committee. Letters
received from citizens of weight and influence show that the movement will find cor
dial support and prompt help whenever it is necessary to call lor active aid. It is
evident that San Francisco, not less than the cities of the East, is eager and ardent
to brine about the establishment of Cuban independence and can be counted on to do
everything which may be needful to attain the desired end.
There is reason to believe that nothing more will be required of the committee
than to concentrate public sentiment on the issue and co-operate with committees
in other cities in exerting the moral influence of the people. In no country in the
world does public opinion have so much effect upon Government as in this. When
it is made evident to Congress and the administration that the American people desire
the independence of Cuba, even if it should be necessary for our Government to
intervene, it will only be a question of time when such steps will be taken by the
Government as will fulfill the popular demand. It is reasonable to expect, therefore,
that our committee will hardly be called upon to make any extraordinary appeals
to the people. It will be sufficient that they represent the popular will and express
to those in power the policy which the people desire to see enforced.
The committee having been appointed will soon organize by the election of a
president, and the next step will be to arrange for a mass-meeting to arouse public
sentiment and to afford an opportunity for the expression of the will of the people.
These steps we may expect to be taken as speedily an possible. There is no reason
why there should be any delay. In a case of this kind a preliminary campaign of
educalion is unnecessary. The public mind is fully instructed on the importance
of the issue, and is fully made up to the determination that the war should be
ended, even if the steps taken to end it should involve the active interference of
the United States.
THE CLOVEEDALE PAIR.
In his address at the opening of the
Sonoma County Fair at CJoverdale Juilee |
A. G. Burnett of Santa Rosa very truly ,
eaid that no words or advertising docu- j
ments could so clearly express ttie fertility
â nd resources of Sonoma Valley as the I
fine exhibits of fruit and wine which h*Â»
saw around him. This statement, though'
triie, was worth uttering and worth com
â¡lent. It can never be too often repeated j
that the best and surest wav for California j
to mate her resources known i 3 to exhibit J
them.
The people of the Eastern States are j
ignorant of the real conditions of Califor
nia. They know a little about some sec
tions, but of the State as a who.c they
know almost nothing. Accustomed to
think of States as they exist Id the East,
where each has a ceriain definite climate
and a certain limit of product?, they do
not realize that in California there is an
infinite variety, and ttiat within the limits
of this commonwealth we have the snows
and pine forests of Maine combined with
the orange groves an'l mild winters of
Florida. The few people of the East w!m
do know something of the wide range of
our products do not know that there is a
citrus belt in the northern as weli as the
southern part of the State, and that the
area of California suited for the produc
tion of semi-tropical fruits reaches further
in a line from north to south than it does
from east to west.
The Cloverdale Citrus Society, in erect
ing a handsome and spacions pavilion for
holding county fairs, has conferred an
important benefit not only upon the city
of Cloverdale and county of Sonoma but
upon the whole State. Reports of the ex
hibits will find their way to the East, and
people in that section of the country who
think of seeking homes in milder climates
will be sure to look on tiie map to Â«cc
where Cloverdale is. In this way an im
i portant work of educating the Eastern
j mind will be accomplished, and the fair
will achieve far more for Northern Cali
fornia than will be apparent from the sur
face.
From the reports which come to us it
seems that the exhibit includes a much
larger variety of fruit than even some Cal
ifornians expected. There are excellent
displays, not only of oranges and lemons,
but of lime?, tigs, prunes, olives and
almonds. That the wine exhibit is good
goes without saying, for Sonoma has long
been famous for its wine production. It
is to be noted that among other displays
was a considerable one of silkworm co
coons. This gives another promise of the
coming of the time when California will
be a silk-producing State and when we
will be able to furnish perhaps all the silk
which the American market demands.
Taking all things into consideration the
exhibit has been a notable one in every
respect, and reflects credit upon the enter
prise and the management of the men
who promoted it. The Cloverdale fair will
take rank hereafter among the important
State events of each succeeding year, and,
as time passes, will receive an increasing
patronage. Congratulations are therefore
due to the men and women who have
tauen the risks of the experiment and
made it successful. They deserve the
thanks not only of their own community
bnt of the State at large.
Senator Lexow of New York has the
happy faculty of getting appointed chair
man of committees charged with making
investigations which attract attention,
und he has also the faculty of making
most of the opportunity. As a reputation
maker on legislative lines he is now the
most conspicuous man in the Union, and
in fact is very nearly as well known as a
prize-tighter.
A bill has been introduced into the
South Carolina Legislature to provide for
the sale of native wines at the State dis
pensaries, and if in that way the people
can be taught to use wine instead of
whisky the dispensary system will prove
one of the best steps in the direction of
temperance ever made in America.
A curious fraud has been exposed by a
showing made to Congress that quite a
number of works are broughi into this
country marked "copyright" when they
are not copyrighted at all and have never
paid copyright duties. It is proposed to
enact a law imposing heavy penalties for
the fraudulent use of the word.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1897.
THE UNEMPLOYED.
Among the plain proposed for giving
work to the unemployed men of the City
are the construction of themnch-chscupsed
boulevard connecting the park and the
ocean drive, the open inÃ ol vacant lands
of the City for cultivation in the growth
of vegetables and the employment of men
in placer mining on Government lands.
Bach of these plans has its peculiar merits,
and all of them deserve to be tried. Cer
tainly San Francisco ought to be able to
provide some means for employinc her la
bor, and should not hesitate to make ex
per.naenta in that direction.
Of the proposed plans the one most
likely to receive popular favor is the con
struction of the boulevard. The worK is
one which has long been under considera
tion. It has been thoroughly discussed,
and public opinion approves it. To
carry out the work, however, it will be
rucessary to raise at least $20,000 by pri
vate subscription, since it seems that the
City has no money to devote to the pur
pose. The sum is la.rge. but not too large,
lor a City of such wraith as this.
It must be borne in mind that the bur
den of charity imposed upon the wealthy
people of San Francisco is very slight in
comparison with that which rests upon
t c wealthy of other citiea of the Union.
The severe blizzarUs of the EiÂ»st require
lame gifts from the well-to-do people in
Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Chi
cago to furnish the poor of those citiea
with food, fuel and clothing. From such
calls for charity as this our climate relieves
us, and it would seem, therefore, that we
ought easily to obtain the money neces
sary to give work to those who need it.
It is doubtful whether the plan of open
ing vacant lots in the City for cultivation
would prove as advantageous here as it
did in Detroit, where, under the direction
of Mayor Pingree, it was first tried. The
Detroit workers achieved their greatest
*uccesa in the crowing of potatoes. This
was possible in Michigan, but in Califor
nia, where potatoes are produced in quan
tities which outrun the demands of the
market, it is not likely that any treat
profit would result to the workeis who cul
tivated the lots. The same objection
would apply to almost any vegetables
that could be raised. The worker would
get what he needed for his own table, but
could hardly hope to obtain any profit
Irora what he had to sell in the market.
What could be accomplished In the way
of placer mining by inexperienced work
ers it is impossible to foresee. That there
is gold in our mountain streams available
to those who know now to work them
properly is made evident by the statement
of Commissioner Fitzgerald that upward
of 10,000 Chinese are engaged in the in
dustry, and that they send annually to
the Mint over $300,000 in gold. The work,
however, is a risky experiment, and it
could hardly be entered upon by a man
who had a family to support. It is of
course better to do that than to do noth
ing, and to that extent the plan may rank
among those which are worth trying.
LAND FRAUDS.
The. State Board of Trade has done well
in calling the attention of the Governor
and the Legislature to the injury inflicted
upon the State by fraudulent schemes
projected by unscrupulous men to sell
worthless lands in this State to credulous
people In the East or in Europe. It is
time that these schemes should be checked.
They work harm not only to the person
deceived but to the people at large, and
the issue of their prompt suppression,
therefore, is a matter of public concern.
The Board of Trade recalls the fact
that recently a report of the British
I Consul-General residing in San Francisco
declaring that the colonization schemes
projected in this State were for the most
â¢ pun frnudulent and deceptive was deemed
! of sufficient importance by the British
j Goverament to be transmitted to I'arlia-
I ment. It was, therefore, given the widest
publicity, and will have its effect in
determining intending home-seekers not
only in Great Britain, but in many parts
of Europe, to avoid California in selecting
I sites for their proposed colonizations.
I As the Board of Trade points out the
representations made by the British Con
sul were not wholly false. Tney contain
] so much of trnth that it is impossible for
us to meet them with a general denial.
The only recourse left is to take the
' initiative in exposing fraudulent land
schemes and thereby cive assurance to
intending immigrants that they will not
be cheated and deceived when they trust
to representations made by the land
agents of the State.
We cannot agree with the Board of
Trade that there should be appointed a
commission of immigration whose duty it
shall be to institute inquiry into the char
acter of all colonization scnemes projected
in the State. We have already more com
missions than the people care to support,
and the results obtained from those in ex
istence are not of a nature to induce the
public to approve of the creation of a new
commission. It ought to be possible for
us to suppress frandulent colonization
schemes by the machinery of law already
in existence. Certainly it would be well
for us to try what could be done without
imposing further burdens upon the people
beiore we resort to the experiment pro
posed.
The matter is one requiring careful con
sideration. It cannot be dismissed as of
little importance, nor can it be riehtly
solved by hasty and inconsiderate action.
Deierence is due of course to the recom
mendations made by the State Board of
Trade, for the officers and directors of
that body have undoubtedly given the
subject more study than others. They
have clearly pointed out the injury which
is done to the commonwealth, and even
if their solution of the problem is not ac
cepted, it is none the less worthy of care
ful study on the part of the Governor and
the Legislature before it is rejected.

STARTLING INNOVATIONS MARK THE PRESENT ERA.
From time to time, at intervals of almost dramatic shortness, ideas which Change the
whole economy of modern warfare or prospective warfare occur.
With the new year came the startling fact that in its most perfect state the most peneci
battle-ship, the late&t addition to tne navies of the world, was practically useless as lar as
imDerviousness to the torpedoes of an enemy
was concerned, for the discovery of a new and
terribly destructive missile had just precluded
the possibility of defense. (
In fact, the changes and increase in war s
marvels and possibilities seem never-ending
end as regular of recurrence as fashion's de
crees, and the latest of them all is one which
may offset the aspect of the battlefield, be
fore, during and after conflict.
It is a novel cycle which is going to do
all this, that cycle which has borne the brunt
of the flouts and jibes and jeers of military
men on account of its declared utter inappli
cability to the usages of modern warfare.
Its disability iv this connection has been
overcome at last, however, and the cycle is
about to usurp the railroad train's privilege
in the transportation of troops, not only trans
porting them but enabling them to travel
even in the face of an enemy, for the soldier
iv this case will be armed as no soldier was
ever armed before.
This new motor cycle may be considered a genuine scientific acquisition, and you can
learn the full particulars concerning it in The Sunday Call.
The French and particularly the Parisians are a wonderful people in many ways, and In
none more so than in the precision and punctuality with which they execut^and realize
undertakings which in their conception seem insuperably difficult of performance.*
New, the Exposition Universelle which they have under consideration at present will
probably contain a building which, exteriority and interiorlly, will probably excel their other
wonderful achievements, at least in some particulars.
It is to be a woman's building on a most bizarre plan.
The interior will bo fitted up very much on conventional lines having waiting-rooms, re
tirinfi-rooms. lecture hall, library, even bedrooms and bath facilities, etc., just like any well,
appointed ladies' club.
But it Is the exterior of this building which shall be the cynosure of all eyes by day, and
even more intently by night, and if you read The Call next Sunday you will be able to appre
ciate its unique beauty as though you saw it.
The artistic will enjoy a congenial literary repast next Sunday in two fine contributions
on the subject of pictures.
One is by Van Dyck Brown and Is in his usual entertaining vein.
The other treats of portrait painting, its history, Its existence in collected form and the
vicissitudes and triumphs of the masters of one great class of art.
"He that runs may read" and he that sits at home may enjoy the results of the run. The

Tom Gregory, the Clark Russell of this Coast, has written a most delightful story for the
delectation of the readers of The Sunday Call, all about pilots and the life which they know

Russell's famous thrillers may expect a similar smack and savor from this nearer-shore narra

The literary epicure and bookworm will have their usual gratification and scholarly
pilotage in the book pace of The Sunday Call, and" should not fall of its careful perusal.
In fact, The Sunday Call will bo a compendium of terse and pithy editorials, accurate '
and extensive telegraphic news, most reliable local information for all; short and enjoyable
stories, science, art, literature, drama and fashion; in fact, everything that goes to make up a
groat newspaper and to make life worth living.
Be wise and tell not to secure a copy, and send in your orders now, that you may not be

AROUND IHE CORRIDORS.
Unusual Interest Is be.ng caused by the Eng

large area of land near Rial to, to be used in the
production of canalgre. It is be'leved they
will make a bigsucct ss of it. Thomas H. Vau
I- rank, the electrician, of this City, wuo is In

transaction that had taken place in that part
of California for a long time. S*ld he:
'â¢The .ransfer of the large holdings of the
?an Francisco Savings Union, in the San Ber
nardino Valley, to a syndicate of English capi
talists, and the colonization of the 8000 or
more acres by the new company opens up a
field of industry new to California, and Is an
experiment, the successful outcome of which
will be watched with more than ordinary in
terest.
"Canaigre, as a staple article of commerce,
has received but little attention in the United
States, although indigenous to the mesas of
Southern California and some portions of Ari

"During the winter months the plant flour
ishes in ita perfection, and, by virtue of Its
tuber-like roots, has spread with such rapid
ity, in the cultivated districts, as to become a
source of serious annoyance to orchardists.
"The broad, luxuriant, Deet-like leaves grow
with wonderful rapidity, new plants spring
ing as if by magic from the root particles that
escape the cultivator of the watchful orchard
ist.
"The roots, resembling in appearance a
small sweet potato, are rich in tannin, or tan
nlc acid, valuable chiefly for tanning pur
poses: and it is with this object in view that
English promoters have taken hold of Califor
nia's new industry.
"The land to be devoted to the growing of
canaigre comprises one of the most fertile
tracts iv the .^an Bernardino Valley, in the
heart of the citrus district. The vast holdings
embrace what has for years been known as
the 'Thirteen-mile Desert," lying west of the
town of Klalto, on the Southern California
Railroad. The soilâ a rich sandy loamâ has
never been subjected to cultivation, because
of the scarcity of the water supply.
"English capital has secured the valuable
water rights oi the San Francisco Savings
Union, which for many years have been tho
source of the bitterest contention and upon
which Judge McKinley lately passed a decision
favorable to the present owners.
"The land will be thrown opon for the culti

so-called pests will be brought to a high state
of cultivation and subjected to a rigid test as
a money-makitiÃ commodity."

CHANGE* IN IHIRIY YEARS
New York Times.
In 1867 the money In ihe country was

money in circulation was then $18.28 per

than 72 cents to the dollar; now tt is $21.10
per capita, and every dollar is wortu 100

A CITY'S SAVINGS BANKS.
now Paris Provide* for the Wants of
Her Pfople.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I have tried to show, how Paris as a city gov
vernment provides shelter, food and even
clothes, to some extent, for her dependent
poor; also how the city has provided pawn
shops, which have been established over a
hundred years to loan money on goods and
chattels at a low rate of interest to unfortu
nate citizens in the time of their misfortune
or distress, both as a matter of municipal hu
manity and prudent business. I now invite
attention to her municipal savings banks in
the briefest manner possible.
My authority for the information presented
is the same that I have frequently cited of late,
"Municipal Government in Continental Eu
rope," by Albert Shaw. I take the liberty of
transcribing a paragraph. "A good system of
savings banks is much more than a conveni
ence to the prudent and economical of a com
munity. It is a powerful promoter of thrift
and a constant enemy of extravagance and
improvidence. The multiplication ol savings
banks throughout Franceâ municipal and pri
vate systems as well as the branches of the
national postal systemâ is a factor of prime
importance in the conservation of the national
wealth. Paris is elaborately served by a series
of branches belonging to the national system;
but it has also a distinct municipal system of
earlier date and of still greater local impor
tance. "
Bime details must De given. There is a great
central bank ana it has in all forty branches
located throughout the city and in the suburbs.
The numb-r of individual" depositors in 1890
was 582,000, which had increased in 1893 to
030,000. Thus one person in every four for
the population was a depositor in 1803. In
that year the total amount of the deposits was
100,000,000 francs, or $32,000,000, and nearly
half the depositors had icss than 25 francs, or
#5, their deposits being about a million and a
half of the total $32,000,000 of deposits. In
1892, ten years alter the establishment of the
national postal savings batiks, which are kept
in the branch pos.tomces, the Paris depositors
had to their credit in these banks (58,000,000
francs, though the average credit was much
smaller than in the municipal banks.
The primary schools of Paris also have school
savings banks, which are branches of the
municipal system aud are established mainly
for educational purposes; and yot these school
banks imnually collect about 150,000 francs
from the small school children. The funds of
all these savings banks are invested chielly in
public bonds 01 various kinds, municipal and
i^tate, and depositors are paid trom 3] S l^ to
33 i per cent interest on their savings.
When we read that Paris advances rent
money to her distressed citizens; that the mu
nicipality loans money as a pawnbroker to
people In financial straits at 0 per cent as a
LiiMm-ss affair end finds it profitab.e; that
municipal employment agencies tind work for
the unemployed iree of cost as an economic
measure; that the city has lodging-houses 111
which to snelter and feed destitute men and
women while seeking employment; that poor
children are clothed, fed, sheltered and edu
cated and healthful occupations found for
them on leaving school; that skillful phy
sicians are sent to the homes of the destitute
sick, and medicines and nurses are
supplied gratis by the city; that
the city provides slaughter - houses,
inspects tne meat and protects the people
against infection and extortion; that city
dairies supply pure mint to the poor at the
lowest price which returns a small profit; that
in a word, the inunicitmllty assumes the care
of the less furtunate of the population in the
fraternal spirit of "a big brother" who cares
for his own and is able to do It, because he
cannot afford to have members of his family
in distress or sick and dylng'for the want of a
helping hand; and that all these humane
things are done by such wise business methods
that the municipality not only saves money by
preventing crime and breeding criminals but
actually '-makes it pay," and at the same time
is elevating ana enlightening the whole sub
stratum of society, we in Saa Francisco may
well pause and do a little rational thiuking
While the unemployed are paradius; our
streets to the number of 500, who have turned
out in the face of the reluctance all men feel
to make a show of their misfortunes, and
when they appeal in plain good English and
a patient spirit for an opportunity to work i 1
a time of peace if the State shall expect to call
upon them in war to lay down their lives if
need be for their country and its institu
tions, and that appeal is met in a nutter of
helplessness by the municipal government, it
does seÂ«m to me that it is high time ior us to
learn how they manage these things which
are aone so much better in Paris, Glasgow and
the English cities.

OUR NATIVE SONS.
Stanford Parlor's "At Home" In Shasta

The hall had been decorated by A. F.
Sehleicher, a member of the order who
is of an artistic turn of mind, in a man
ner representative of the Valentine season.
There was a commingling of blood red hearts,
true lovers' knots and favors, all suggestive
of the tender passion, which is supposed to be
strongest at this period. It was a very neat
conceit and much admired. Harrison House
worth, president of the parlor, acted as master
of ceremonies, and he was assisted by J. J.
McCarthy, Ed Angelo, John Croon, R. R. Mar-

Unemployed Have Secured
a Home on Howard
Street.
Over Three Himdred Men En
jiyed Hearty Mea's Last
Evening.
ActiVJ Steps Are Bnng Taken To
ward Providing Food, She ter
and Emp oyraent
One of the fim and most important
movements in behalf of tiio unemployed
of San Francisco was made yesterday
when the hirt-e building at 614 Howard
street was secured for the shelter of those
who by iil fortune have no homes. Last
niirnt over 150 men slept in tho large hall
which was to some extent warmed by a
huge range, a donation from W. W. Jion
taf-ue. To be sure the place aid not con
tain a 1 the comforts of homo, but it was
a godsend to the poor fellows who ottier
wi-e might have been obliged to tramp
the streets all night â for the nieht was
bitter cold ana the atmosphere was as
damp as it was chilly.
The new headquarters of the unem
ployed was cngared early yesterday morn
ing by S. A. Leffiigwell, chairman of the
general and executive committee. He
agree \ to pay .$75 per month for the prem
ises to J. Martin, the agent of the prop
erty. The main apartment is a lar?e hall
capable of accommodating about lÂ£oo men
by making u*e ot the gallery. As quickly
as possible all of this space will be filled
with beds, cots and bunks for the men.
Adjoining the large room are several
smaller apartments that wiM be utilized
for storerooms, kitchen, washrooms, etc.,
after the plan of the old Bijou Theater
thet siood on Market street where the
new trpreckels Market now stands.
The executive committee will at once
reduce the management of the new home
for the unemployed to a system. S'"Â» that
only worthy people will be provided for
and the m< Si desarving cases will be pro
vided for lirst. The list of applicants for
assistance will be very carefully looked
over, for those in charge are determined
that the; will give a good account of all
of the money and donations received from
the public
So far the committee has met with con
siderable success, and from present indica
tions the public will by its generosity see
that the worthy poor of San Francisco are
provided with the necessaries of life.
At 10:30 o'clock yesterday morning
Chairman Letting well presided over a
body of about 1200 men, who assembled at
117 Turk street, but as there were several
important committees still out, the meet
ing adjourned until i' p. si. In the after
noon the committee appointed to call j
upon Mayor Phelan with reference to se
curing employment for as many men as I
possible presented as its reDort the follow- J
ing Setter:
Gentlemen: I regret to inform you that i
Mayor Piielau is confined to his room by ;
sickness and, consequently, will hot be able to
keep his engagement with you at 12:30 p. m.
to-day. He has directed me to say that the
road proposition is receiving due'considera- '
jtion and that he is anxious to do everything i
possible for the betterment of the present con
dition of the unemployed. Yours truly,
W. B. Sullivan, Mayor's Clerk.
The three soliciting committees then
reported. A. J. Birell reported that Mur
phy, Granj, <fc Co. had donated ?10; W.
.ttodpers reported that Police Judges Low
and Campl>ell had each donated $5. James
Gore of Mission street a sack of coal and
the Spring Valley Water Company had
promised all the water the men required
ut the new headquarters on Howard street;
William Grimmer reported that Hoi brooic.
Merrill & Stetson had contributed about $20
worth ot cooking utensils, \V. W. Monta
gue a laige cooking ranee and the Ameri
can Tea Importing Company twenty
pounds of tea.
By this time the afternoon was well
sp?nt, and about COG men fell into l.neand
in the drizzling rain marched from the
Temple to the new quarters on Howard
street. All were well pleased with the
premises. Chairman Lafhngwell an I A.
J. t'obe delivered short addresses from the
gallery, in which they expressed the be
lief that the hour of deliverance was close
at hand, and that the public would pro
vide means by which the men's imme
diate wants will be filled, and that ere
long employment will .be furnished by
which the men could become again inde
pendent.
Fobe then placed the men in line and
gave out 315 ten-cent meal tickets. In a
short time these pieces of pasteboard were
presented at the restaurants, where the
hungry ones were well received.
It required but a glance to see that the
assistance was not rendered in vain, and
that every man present really deserved all
that he obtained. There was soup, roast
beef, mutton stew or pork, beans, pota
toes, coffee and all the bread required, and
all served smoking Lot. Maybe there are
many in this Gity who would not be at
tracted by such a spread, but tne cold,
wet, hungry fellows who sat at the tables
found no fault with their fare. After the
meal a large number went back to the
headquarters and put up the range and
dried their clothes by the fire; and those
who hÂ»d blankets spread them on the
floor and slept. The others slept in chairs
and on tt c benches â none too comfort
able, to be sure, but still, better than
tramping the streets in the cold and wet.
While the men were sleeping the execj
tive committee again repaired to 117 Turk
street to discuss future movements. One
of the soliciting committees was instructed
to make special efforts to secure lumber
from tlie lumber merchants in order to
make bunks, tables, benches, etc., which
are much needed.
Lights in tho building are another ne
cessity that will have to be looked after.
Messrs. Moody, Grimmer and Sivell were
appointed as a committee to see that none
but worthy people are provided for -and
that all imposters are thrown out of the
ranks.
A committeÂ° consisting of W. Grimmer,
J. Kline and H. Townsend was appointed
to draft, a plan for the organization of the
unemployed in tne headquarters and for
the management of the same; nl-o to sug
gest officer* and outline their duties for
and in the various departments of the new
home. There will be several meeting
held to-day.

Why he did this has not been explained. He

Years.
Aspbaltum, Woodrn Blocks ani Vit

The representatives of the Merchants'
As-ociation were heard yesterday after
noon concerning the matter of street
pavements. The delegation was hc-aiied
by .President Dohrtnann and was accom
panied by Ernest Mr.i; 1 1: â '!;.;!;, c vil engi
neer, and by Bernard Biener.lield. The
delegation nearly filled the room in which
the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors wus sitting.
Mr. Dohrrnann opened the proceedings
with a brief statement, and then Mr. Mo
Culloutjh read a lone document which
embodied recommendations made by him
to and favorably considered by the Mer
chants' Association. The recommenda
tion? had been put into the shape of an
ordinance to amend Order 21-I*l of the
Board of Supervisors, and in the preamble
f:iiriy defined the wishes of the associa
tion, as follow) :
Amending general order No. 214G by adding
thereto specifications for paving with asphalt,
wooden blocks and vitrified brick, to amend
the specifications for paving with basalt
blocks mid to provide for the paving of ac
cepted streets with any other paving material
which the contractor will guarantee to main
tain in good order for five years from the date
of the completion of the work.
The section providing for a guarantee
is, in full, as follows:
Sec. H. Section 21 of the abovo mentioned
genernl order shall read as follows:
Bee 21. Upon accepted streets which the
Board <>t BapervUors has accepted by orÂ«ii
nance, whenever any repaying Ls to be done
any material may be used the contrac
tor will guarantee to maintain in ;
for a period of uot less than live nan, The
guarantee shall ue accompanied by r bond
with some responsible surety company as
surety, in the amount ot thp contract price.
Said burety shall be bound to perform tho
work if the contractor fail to do ho, aud the
contract shall specify that if at the etui of the
live years, or other period, the pavenie.it la
not In good condition, it shall be relaid with
the same or i-ny other material which is ac
ceptable to the Boar I Â«>f Bu |.< rrlaors.
In the case of work done nnder this section
or in the-case of any guaranteed work which
is not done under â peoiflcaiionj provided for
otherwise in this i rder or the general order of
which this ls amendatory, the contractor
guaranteeing the pavement shall prepure the
specifications.
The foregoing provisions are the ones
which caused the principal discussion,
but there were others which were talked
over. One of these was as follow-:
Upon the concrete foundation, prepared end
laid as provided In section 4. shall be laid a
layer 01 asphalt "-earln i; surface, the bants of
whinn, or paving cement, man be asphaltum,
and the use of coaltar, petroleum, residuum
or of so-called artificial i>.*pnalts will not be
permitted in any portion of ilie work.
There were many features which were
passed without comment, . all the time
having been expended on the foregoine.
These were submitted to the Street Com
mittee, however, and will bo the subject
of much discussion hereafter. Among
them were the following:
The basalt blocks In the roadway to be laid
go that each block shall be imbedded in the
sand, and all blocks must set firmly upon the
foundation in a perfectly upright position
and as closely and compactly together as It is
possible to set them. The variation in width
of blocks in any one line across the roadway
shall not exceed one quarter of an inch. The
blocks shall not be less than 3% inches nor
more than 4 inches wide, not Uss than 7 nor
mote than 10 inches Ion?, and not more than
7', nor less than 7 inches deep. The minimum
number of blocks to the square yard shall
be 32.
In reference to asphalt paving Home of
the more important provisions proposed
were as follows:
Beforo the time of opening the bids for as
phalt paving the bidder must deposit with
the Superintendent of Streets the following
samples, which be will guarantee to be equal
i to the material* he will use: First, a sample
of the carbonate of lime or mineral dual ; sec
ond, a sample of sand; third, a sample ot the
asphaltic cement; fourth, a sample of the
liquid asphalt; fifth, a sample not less than
' six inches square, of the required thickness,
â of the finished wearing surfuce. This sample
shall have a corner broken off and a certifi
cate of a competent chemist shall be filed
with It which shall state that the chemist
broke the piece off the corner and analyzed it,
and ho shall state in said certificate the quan
tities of the materials therein and their
quality as shown by his analysis. The certify
cate of the chemist shall be tiled with the
| samples at the expense of the contractor fur
nishing the same.
During the progress of the work the con
tractor shall permit the Superintendent of
Streets to take samples of the materials and
test them to satisfy himself that the materials
used comply in all essentials witn the samples
submitted with the bids.
There were provisions concerning the
laying of bricks, and also concerning tho
use of wooden blocks. The blocks that
were considered usable were defined as
follows:
Kiln-driel blocks of white or yellow pine
treated with not iv* than ten pounds oi creo
to tli e cubic foot may be .used. The di
mensions may be 4 by 4 or t> by G Inches
and -1 inches deep, measured niouj,' the
grain. Or the blocks may be a inches wide,
7 to 10 Inches long and (i Inches dtep. But
only one >/. â  <<r kind of blocks may be used
on any one piece of work. They shall be laid
In lines across the street with as close joints
as it is p< ssible to make, and when the pave
ment is completed the joints sliall l><
with nsphfilt and the paveraent covered with
ssphalt and gravel, as specified for the laying
of redwood I
Kiln-dried encalvpttn may be used In blocks
6 luch&i deep (uensured along the grain), :i
Inches wide and from 7 to 10 inches lon*.
Iron t.nrk - shall not ba used, i i
red j-Miin (E. rottrata) or blue gum (E. giobu
i they shall be treated with creo
â  1 for pine blocks. Tftilow
wood (E. mlcrocorys) or b'.nck batt (EÂ» pilu
larus) will not requiro any treatment.
The extracts are. civen at some length
to indicate the leading proposals of the
Merchants' Association.
Mr. Dobrmann contended that the con
tractor :>â¢Â» Davea a street and guarantees
it for a period of yÂ«-ars should have the
sole richt to tear it up when it is necessary
to make openings for pipes. Tho associa
tion hopes, he also said, to see Market
*trept re paved, hut that may be a long
way uU. P rhaps a sewer system should
first be provided for the City. Tun led
him to say that the association believes
that shouiii the Legislature authorize the
bond issue which has been recommended
by the Supervisors the issue would by
open to question conc^rnintr ita legality
unless it was based upon a prior estimate
â¢ co-,'. "Wo ire about lo aak the
Supervisors," he said, "to not ahead with
the work of the sewer commission from
the DO :it where it was dropped."
Mr. McDonald of the City Street Im
provement Company made some sugcea
rions. He thought the idea of a guar
antee not a bad one, but was of the opin
ion that it would not be fair to enforce a
surety guarantee. The ordinary bond
ought to be sutticier.t.
Mr. Dohrmaon s-aid that the ordinary
: mv not been satisfactory in all cases.
Then he a?ked Mr. McDonald wh:it he
thuught about holding back part of the
price in lieu of a bond.
Mr. McDonald said tnat such a plan had
not worked well. He alijo said that there
was no difference in the wearing quality
of asphalt and bitumen; also that it ap
peared to hi'u that the provisions would
bnr out nil but two asphalt companies.
Mr. McCullouprh denied that the plan
proposed would shut out competitors, and
Mr. Bienenfeld, who spoke at considera
ble length, also denied the assertion. The
discussion was somewhat ceneraL Tne
last remarks were made by Mr. Dolir
naann, who summed ud what the Mer
chants' Association wants as follows:
Modern pavements, the opportunity to
introduce different kinds of pavements
competitively, and a puarantee of good
work. The committee took t li #=- whole sub
ject matter under consideration.

THE OUTLOOK
FOR BUSINESS
E. J. Mitten, a Millionaire
of Boston, on the
Prospects.
Everybody East Expects a Spe
c>al Session and Tariff
Revision.
Will Start I lie Wheels, Employ Msn
aud Cause Large Investments
Ev.ry where.
E. J. Mitten, a millionaire member ot
the Croat dry-goods house of Jordan,
Marsh it Co., the largest in New England,
is at the Palace. He has been about three
weeks in different parts of Southern Cali
fornia, and will now be in this City and
vicinity for a short time. He is accom
panied by Mrs. Mitten, William H. Wood,
a leading lumber dealer of Boston, and
Mr-. Wood.
Mr. Mitten has been for nine years a
member of the large house alluded to, but
he has been connected with it since his
boyhood, some thirty-fivo years. He is
an intimate friend of General Charles H.
Taylor, proprietor of the Boston Globe,
who was here recently. I'robably no man
in New England is better infornie.l as to
the condition of business in the East.
"In the East there is a general feeline,"
said Mr. Mitten, "that soon after Mr. Me-
McKmley is inaugurated a special ses
sion of Congress will be called and the
tariff raised. If we get that done we will
be enabled to start a vast number of fac
tories and give employment to men now
idle.
"The revision, if properly made, will
bar out large amounts of foreicn-made
good-, and we will then make these goods
ai home. Instead of sending our money
for foreign gooda we will keep it at home,
and give employment to men who now
cannot get it. With employment they can
ocis.
"mere is just as much money in the
country now v* there ever was. Boston is
full of it, and New York is, and nearly all
largo places have it in l.berul amounts,
but thosu men who have It won't put it
out till they see they can get returns for it.
''Tho men who have been elected to
Congress are expected to at once give re
lief to the people. The men who put
them there are waiting for them to do it,
and it is the helief in the East that Con
cress knows th s is true, and will proceed
at niico to reconstruct the tariff.
*'I am surprised to see that California,
which is bigger than all New England and
one or two other State-" thrown in, has al
most no manufactories. In the East we
have them everywhere. It seems to me
that at least California might manufacture
a great many of the things which the
people use, whereas I am told that little
more is done than produce things in the
rough and soil them. And the freight-*,
some say, eat up most of the profit*."
Mr. Mitten's firm spends from $115,000
to $150,000 a year in advertising. He and
his friends will, after seeing tins City,
visit Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Jose and
the Lick Observatory.
GONE TO THE
PETROLEUM FIELDS
Strange Visit of Michael
Cudahy to San
Francisco. .
He Is Fighting the Standard
Trustâ Believed to be Mak
ing a Coup.
Received Numb?r!ess Cablegrams and
Ccme and Went Mysteriously.
His Visit to Los Acgoles.
Michael Cudahy of Cudahy Bros., the
millionaire puckers of Chicago, Omaha
and Kansas City, who were announced re
cently as preparing to fight the great
monopoly, the Standard Oil trust, has
been on a quiet visit here for the last day
or two. It has been quiet so far as would
generally appear, but to those who think
themselves on the inside it was in refer
ence to matters cf momentous import
nice.
Mr. Cudahy has been very busy, almost
constantly answering cablegrams and tel
egrams. They were going to suite 84, on
the New Montgomery-street side of the
Palace, which he occupied, in large num
bers, and when Mr. Cudahy was not re
ceiving them he was usually answering
them.
It is believed that his visit to San Fran
cisco is in the interest of oil wells and oil
lands in Southern California. lie and his
brothers, who have lately branched out
from meat packing and dealing in grain
corners to furnishing oil for great corpora
tions, have acquired large oil lieids in both
Ohio and Indiana.
Tn'.-y bare also lately bought up bifr oil
wells and lands in the rich belt near
Kanitakee, 111., and have constructed
a pipe line to Chicago and built a great
tank in the latter place. It has already
been announced that they intend to fight
the Standard Oil trust. When this was
called to r,he attention of Mr. Cudahy, he
asked to be excused lrom giving any in
terview because of the important matters
engaging his attention. He soon there
after left for Los Angeles.
It is believed from all the circumstances
that the Cudahys are laying their ropes
to do a land-office business in oil. They
hnve got into ii gradually and not precipi
tately, as would at first seem. Michael
Cudahy is the inventor of oleomargarine,
butterine and several other things which
have revolutionized the packing business.
He made some 01 these discoveries while
wortiug for Phil Armour, for, as a good
many know, Michael and John Cudahy
aud their two brothers were once Door
boys and worked for Armour.
They do not do so any more, for they
are in front of the van. But as to the oil.
From butterine and oleomargarine and
the packing business itself, in which they
engaged extensively, they got to supply
inn fuel oil and afterward liluminatui;;
oil. Ail the fuel oil that Charles T. Yerkes
uses for his extensive cable and electric
hues is bought of them. They also have
an exclusive contract to furnish fuel oil
for the Edison Electric Company and the
Union Stockyards concerns, formerly fur
nished by the Standard Trust.
This has given them a great ground
work on which to proceed. They have
lately started oil wagons all over Chicago.
The Cudahy brothers consist of John,
Michael, Edward and Patrick. One ot
them failed in the panic live years ago,
but the others held him up and have re
deemed his notes and acquired a fortune
of millions besides.
Michael Cudahy wasted no time when
uere. He was full of business from tne
beginning to the end of his visit. He is
now in the southern oil fields.
A di?patch from Los Angeles last night
said the Standard Company was probably
now about to confront the most formid
able rival it had ever known. Mr. Cudahv

The racing at Emeryville yesterday was
interspersed with magnificent rainbows,
streaks of sunshine now and then, shower. 1 *
of rain at intervals compelling the crowd
to keeo under cover and one or two edify
ing dumps that helped deplete the ex
chequer of the talent. Yet with all the
special entries, big fields and a track that
was a sea of mud, bettors more than held
their own. Three tirst choices were success
ful, and the winners of the other three
events were iiot overlooked by the ob-erv
ant eye of the "dope" player. The attend
ance was only fair and the racing was de
void of any special incident.
Fourteen "dogs" started in the opening
five and a half furlong scramble, and good
odds were obtainable against all. At post
lime Edgomount had been played down
from fours to sto 2 favoritism. Bourbon
and Iron Jacket were in front as the stretch
was reached, but both soon had enough,
and Monitor ridden by Gus Wilson, tak
ing the lead won handily trom Flay Boy.
aloto 1 shot. As good as 10 to 1 was laid
against the winner.
Twelve two-year-olds faced the barrier
in the three and a half furlong dash that
followed. Sir William was a pronounced
favorite, and taking command in the
stretch downed On Gua Nita at the end
without effort. Moringa was a fair third.
Frank Jaubert was finally cut loose and
made a runaway race of the third event,
beating the 7 to 5 favorite, Kienzi, fully
ten lengths. The ring at one time laid 12
to 1 against Alex Shields' fast horse. Three
Forks, the second choice, was third.
Always with a weather eye turned
toward muddy eoitig, Louis Ezeil's mare,
Babe Murphy, was right In i.er element
and captured the mile and a sixteenth
selling purse very cleverly, starting a 7 to
5 favorite. Chartreuse, trie second choice,
followed by Ike L, made the running to
the far turn, where Ike fell back and Red
Glenn ran into second position. Chart
reuse managed to hold the lead until
opposite the paddock, where she was
passed by both ihe favorite and the out
sider St. Aignon, Ezell'e mare winning
cleverly by nearly a .ength in L:s4}Â£.
A. B. Spreckeib' sprinter, Pat .Murphy,
unlike his brother Tun, seems to revel in
mud. He was a2to 1 favorite for the fifth
event, n livf- and a half furlong sprint, ami
succeeded in downing Frank Phillips'
good mudlark Shield Bearer quitn
handily. The latter iooked a winner oppo
site tbe pandock, but Pal linished strong
on the outsiae. passing the wire nearly a
length to toe good. Mainstay was a close
third.
Liberal scratching left fbui seven to go
to the post in the final six-furlone spin.
La Flecha was b.icked down to 2 to 1 favorit
ism, and finished laM. Bozeruan, on
Ricardo, one of the second choices, got
that sprinter away in iront, and holding
i: is advantage, led throughout, boating

Richmond District Association Hat
Adopted K'Kolutlon* Against the
Brauuhart Bill.
A special meeting of the Ricnmond Dis
trict Improvement Association was held
Tuesday evening at Siramond's Hall, at
the corner of Fourth avenue and Califor
nia street, Charles H. llubbs, the presi
dent, being in the chair. Many street
railway employes were present. Speeches
were made by Messrs. Uubbs, Ktiox, Van
Frank, Qlynn, Ferretta, GalJand, Stewart
and others. After a lew remaiks J. G.
Maloney introduced and read the follow
ing resolutions, which were unanimously
adopted by a standing vote: â¢
Whereas, The Richmond District has been
fairy treated in the matter of street rail
roads, particularly since the inauguration of
the Sutro Electric Railway; and whereas, any
reduction of streetcar lares at this time would
only work an Injury to this and other lines
who deserve the support of the public lor their
efforts for the public good; ana whereas, the
proposed reduction in lures would certainly
result in the cutting of wage* of the employes
on the different lines, aid believing tuat the
working classes whom this reduction is claimed
to benefit do not wish to be benefited at the
expeuse of their fellow-workers on the differ
ent lines of streetcars in this City, be it
Resolved, That we the citizens of the Rich
mond district do oppose the passage of the
Braonhart or any other similar bill reducing
streetcar fares 8t the present time, believing
that the same would be an (injustice to the
employes on the different lines and a simple
confiscation of the smaller lines in this City
and elsewhere through the State; believing
that competition will fix the rates, and that
alt competing lines be encouraged, and not
crushed out of existence, as the passage of this
bill will certainly do.
Beit further resolved. That we urge our Sen
ators and Assemblymen in the Legislature to
oppose the passage of the Braunhart or any
other similar bill reducing streetcar fares at
present in this City.

ALASKA'S APPEAL.
The Chamber of Commerce Will Assist
to Obtain a JeprÂ«Â«ent!itive In
Congress.
The Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
cisco is working actively to secure a rep
resentative in Congress for Alaska. The
matter was brought io the attention of the
chamber ty L. G. Kaufman, a representa
tive bu-ines- man of Alaska. The gentle
man came to this City for that purpose
alone.
The following petition signed by the
president, Hugh Craig, and the trustees
was yesterday forwarded to the Senate and
House of Repre-emaiives:
The Chamber of Commerce of Sun Francisco
respectiully calls your attention to the neces
sity for the representation of the lhstrict of
Alaska in the House of Representatives. Its
rapid. y incrensing importance, lis isolation
and distance from the seat of our General
Government and the anomaly of its Federal
control by a power thousands oi mtlea distant
which accords it no voice In the protection ot
its interests, appear valid reasons for your ac
quiescence iv this reasonable request. We
consequently pray thr.t you will m~e the
proper steps to admit one representative
from our greatest territory to the Fifty-fifth
Congress.

The committee in charge of the Indian
famine relief fund is meeting with very
encouraging success in all the Western
States, and corn is already on tne way

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Louis James and His Company
Appear in J hakespca: e
at thÂ° Baldwin.
Seme Little lots Wan Do "Turn?"
at the Calilornia-Ndt Week.
Bill?.
Loui* Jnmrs played "Otliei'o"at the Bald
win Theater Wednesday night for the iirst
time during his present engagement. The
performance wai very pr*ttiiy staged, the
opening scene, representing the Grand
canal at Venice, bi-ine a piece of coloring
that almost recalled Turner's Venetian
pictures.
The traeedian's interpretation of Othello
is familiar to San Francisco audiences,
and last niglu he piayt-d the role of the
Moor with his usual thorough effective
ness; there were moments, however,
when Jame-i showed a tendency to drop
his voice overmuch for a theater the size
of the Baldwin.
L'luis James was very enthusiastically
received in "Hamlet" at the Baldwin
'I li^ater last nisht. At the end of the
"Player Scene" the curtain was raised
ajrnin and again, and James w:is finally
obliged to appear alone alter the drop
curta'n had lal e:i.
The actor's interpretation of Hamlet
showed littie perceptible difference from
last year. His characterization is careful
and artistic, and partly owing to the fact
that it is not too deeply tinged with gloom
it interests the audience to a noticeable
degree.
William SpraÃue'* Polonius was tho best
piece of work in the star's support. The
local actor was the fussy, verbose, meddle
some old statesman to the life and dÂ»d
much to atone for some mequantiesin the
performances ol a few of ttie minor num
bers of the cust.
"Our Ltttle Cinderella" at the California
Theater is improving nightly, as the ch.ldren
who play ah the pans, are gaining in courage'
with each performance. Considering the tendtr
ape of a great many of ;i.e lute people and the
sleepy condition which is normally theirs -a
the hour when they are lictlntr their p,-if rni
ance is reaily a remarkable one. Almost to 8
child they areleter-perfeci, aud most of them
act their parts and do their turns lnaw'av
that is charming to every one interested in
children.
Jimmy Horn, tho youthful actor who dig
tinguishes himself mosi, >hows signs of beim
an incipient Ferris Hartman. There are
others However. Gus i Lvick, uho does not
look irs if he had much more than rounded the
first decade of liie, gives * very spirited ren
dering of the roe ot Cinderella's lather Ni-'n
Cook makes quite a character study of the"ro <â¢
of the Princes valet, a ;.a Jennie Sawyer and
Floss.c Sawyer ar* clever little impersouatois
of the nauu-hty siners. Rosina D'Euuer
dances prettily as uinderelLi, but both she and
Auce Coudon. who p ia ys tbe Prince are a
CASTORJA
For Infants and Children.
TiÂ»fao- >y -
good deal biÃger than most of the children.
Ba!>y Ruth Hdwland is tar smallest oi t!ie tote,
and she does a clever little souk and dance
"turn."
It wend improve the performance if the
fairy fountain scene at tJe .>pemng of the play
cou'd be curtailed, for the serious little tairius
are the leist enlivening i>r.rt oi tiie bill.
"Our Littie Cinderella" will ruu till Tuesday
next.
Although in its last r.ights "Chlmmie Fad
don" is still filling the Columbia Theater, and
would no doubt continue to <io so longer if it
were possible ior "t'hiuimie" 10 remain. Next
Monday Fannie Kice opens a season at the
'"olurubin supported by a number of singing
comedians.
The Alcazar company is dome some pood
work tnis week in "A S^crap of Paper," which
has served for the reuppearance of May
Bucklej- and 11 uroToland. MissJu! et Crosby,
one or the Alcazar's debutantes, has been en
tru-u'd with a ;at>re important part, that of
Louise, and is dofnfrit wÂ«slL
Next week QeorgO Osbourne reappears at the
Alcazar and M;su Frances Jolliffe makes her
first appearance there in "Saints and Sinners."
The second edition of the spectacular bur
lesque. "A.addm," is in its last nights at the
Tivoli Opera-hotue. Next week a double bill
will lie presented, the first part of wnlch will
consist of Yon suppe's one-net mythological
comic opera, "Ttte Lavely Galatea," which
has not been seen here for years. The secoi.d
part of the bill will be Gilbert and i-ullivan's
"Patience."
"Out in the Streets" is a melodrama which
offers unusual opportunity ior scenic display,
and full advnnthge is being taken of it at the
Grand this week. Tne company is a lÂ»rge one
and includes several artists especially engaged j
ior tins production. Nut M. Wills, the tramp i
In "The Prodigal Father" ai the Columbia re
cently, has made quite a hit with his special
ties at the Grand this week.
Quite a hit has been made at the Orphcum
this week by the grand opera quariet, con
sisting of Miss Julhi Cott< .-, Miss Dora Busch, I
GuiUe and Abramoff. Miss Emily Lytton ana J
the Hayfs orot tiers began this week by doing j
a comedietta, "A French Marriage"; W'edncs- j
day night they changed their act to a bur- j
lesque ou â¢'< amiLe," whicti proved to be very
amusing. All the other new acts are doing
well.

in conjunction with the league organized
by Jones and Mascherini on September 7.
â¢ ."We shall request the Mayor's commit

said Secretary Ma^oherin: yesterday, "and
' that: conference will probably take place
â¢ at the assembly-room of the Mills build
â¢â¢;n"Â£ on Tuesday or Wednesday night. We
â¢â snail' then make arrangements for a per
manent organization of the committee ap
â  jointed by the Mayor, and their sub-corn
/ wittees in conjunction with our own
I easue will probably provide for the mass-
V meeting. We want to maintain our own
: society independently of the Mayor's
Â" committee; though we expect to co-ODerate
.with them in every particular.
"We realize tile fact that the commit
;;"teenieh appointed by Mayor Phelan are
â¢iusy.men, so we are willing to bear the

pan Francisco, CaL, Feb. 15, 1897.
Editor Call : Your patriotic movement for
".liberty in Cuba and fight against Spanish
butchery is appreciated by all classes of peo
â  pli . and you have their applause, their cheers
aiid their sympathy in the fight.
. For any months past I have felt such inter
est in the Cuban war that I finally wrote to
. .the Junta at New York for information about
tfte cause here in the West. Among other let
"â¢ters I have come very valuable ones from
members of McKinley's Cabinet with whom I
ara acquainted, wherein strong sentiment Is
â  t-xprcss-ed, and with such vigor and clearness
that I may be pardoned for saying that tbe*
policy 'i the new Government, I believe, will
â¢ ha .an aggressive one, with a bold stand in
' favor "of .the Cuban patriots. The editor of
.T'Hs Call is in. possession of the policy ex

:or permission to give them to the public, and
.-.i! consent is giveu from the author I will sub
mit the tame through the columns of your

A. K. Ka-aga, 240 Montgomery street.
â¢ The- local league will soon propose a cir

order are to organize battalions of soldiers
to invade Cuba and demolish the Span

daily, but it is hoped that the masses will
" soon understand that the work of the
league.is to be along lawful lines.

' Mr. Jung and his sons allege that the
executors Lave failed to charge themselves
. with the Â»'ull amount of property that has
â¢came, into their liands, which Bhould be
$ 26, 643- 28; that ihere is no proper ac
' counting for the rent of premises occupied
by George Handel for seventeen months
a-tsl2 per month (?204); the carrying on
erf the billiard business has been "a detri
ment to the estate, showing a loss of
$8046 78; George Handel is not entitled to
â  "wa^es â¢ in addition to commissions as ex
ecutor; that bia charge of $125 a month
for wages is crossly excessive, and ihat
$12 a week would have been enounh, that
being the wages raceived while employed
by- the deceased ; that the interests of ex
ecutor Handel are antagonistic to the in
terests of the estate.
In view, of the circumstances and the
mismanagement of the estate Judge Slack
has 'been asked to issue a citation com
pellin-g the executors to show cause why
the letters testamentary heretofore issued
to them should not be revoked.

THE PEDEBATED CLUBS.
Rights of KailroÂ»dÂ» Over Each Other*
Property Discussed.
; The regular meeting of the San Fran
cisco Association of Improvement Clubs
â¢was held Wednesday night at B'nai B'rith
Hall. .
A The committee on parks, streets and
lowers banded in a report that the Park
Commissioners had promised to put the
Point Lobos road into proper condition
immediately.
The Spalding Carpet Company was
Toted the cause of a certain nuisance, and
the committee on public works author
ized to wait on the Board of Health and
have it abated.
' There is now a measure before the
Legislature to permit two lines ol railroads
\o use the same line for rive blocks. Dr.
stated that Mayor Pnelan is in
favor of having the distance extended to
len blocks, and a resolution was adopted
lavonne such amendment. It will be
sent to the San Francisco representatives
in the Legislature.
Mr. Grady brought to the attention of
ne club the fact thit a measure is now
before the Legislature, fathered by Sena
tor L-itiÃford, giving the plaintiff in a suit
to condemn lanu the right to occupy it
uurmg the pending of |.roceedin ? s, upon
the payment o! a sum f-pecih'ea by the
court, and invited a discussion upon the
subject. Attorney Marcus Rosenthal rose
to Ciiiimpion the measure, and stated that
this coast needs another transcontinental
railway, and if some such measure were
not a iopted it wouid take twenty years to
pass through a small distance.
The acting president thought any meas
ure unconstitutional which contemplated
the seizure of any man's land without due
process of law. Some pretty pertinent
questions were tired at Rosenthal, a.mong
them i,Â»inz "Would he rather act for
Plaintiff or defendant in such a suit?"
He would, on the penerai proposition,
prefer to act for plaintiff.
After a deal of heated discussion an at
tempt was made io put the motion to a
vote. A parliamentary skirmish lasting
Tully thirty ramuies endued, and the club
at last went on the historical page as op
posed to the measure by a majority of
tnree votes.
THE GLEANERS.
*h e y Entertain the txempt Firemen in
Their Hall on I rcnhaiii Place.
The recently organized society styled
The Gleaners, of which Mrs. George J.
Hobe is president and Mrs. Andrew J.
Jessup is vice-president, gave another of
its pleasant entertainments to the old
Exempts in their hall on Brenham place
last Wednesday night. The members of
the society had a good representation, and
after the transaction of business the mem
bers presented an interesting programme
of music and elocution, iii-s Kate Galvin
gave a piano solo, Mrs. J. R. Kenizell,
who has a splendid voice, charmed the
audience with a rendition of "Killarney,"
E. C. Stock entertained wi'.h a mono
logue, KlhÂ» Jones gave a vocal solo, J. R.
Kentz^ll gave evidence or" his vocal powers
and was loudly applauded, Miss Anuie
McCrossen, a bright young airl, recited
"The Outcast's Prayer for a Pair of Shoes"
with a great deal of pathos, and several
other numbers were pre>ented, all serving
to make the reunion a very pleasant one.
John .1. Guiifoyle, secretary of the
Exemuts, suggested that the Gleaners
hold their next, session after the meeting
of the Exempts on the regular meeting
night. The proposition was well received
and will no doubt be acted upon favor
ablj*. as the Exempts' executive commit
tee will peirnit tlie ladies to meet on that
night instead of asspmblins on the night
now proviJed for. Ii is probable that at
the next reunion there will be a ureat
many numbers by volunteers.
Since its organization this new society
of ladies has been doing a great deal of
good among the families of a number of
the old volunteer firemen.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY in, 1897.
SHE FLIES THE
YELLOW FLAG
The China Brought Over
Sea a Case of
Varioloid.
A Chinese Woman From Yokc
hama the Victim of the
Dreaded Disease.
The Ship Is in Qu-irantine, but Her
Passengers May Ec Released
in a Short T m:.
The big China liner China, of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, came into port
at dark last night with the yellow Hag,
that told of smallpox on board, flying at
her masthead. She was reported sixteen
miles off shore at 5 o'clock, but it was not

Would Capsize, but She Finally Righted Saiely.
until she anchored off the Barge Office at
b':so that it became known that the dread
disease had broken out among the pas
sengers.
The sea was running as it seldom does
in the bay, but ;he little revenue cutter
Hartley ran out with a detail of Custom
house inspectors on board and rantred
alongside.
The water was so rough that it would
have been impossible to have got a man
over the side, but even more deterring in
its ellei't was tlie bail that came from
Parser Brickwedel as be leaned over the
rail and roared "sheer off." The rest of
his speech was lost in the howling gale
and Boarding Officer Davis, misunder
stand, ng the reason of his hail roared
back "Custom-house boat; we want to put
injectors aboard."
'Look out. Sickness aboard, case of
varioioid." came the answer, more dis
tinct than true.
A hurried consultation was held on the
Hartley and it was decided that in view of
the danger of trying to put men on board
and the uncertainly as to th â¢ quarantine
regulations i. would be better to wait for
instructions from the Deputy Surveyor of
the I'ort. The Hartley accordingly made
back for the wharf. Lieutenant Butt's
clever handling saving her from being
caught across the liner's bows in the
heavy ebb tide that was running. The
wind and sea increased after the cutter
was again tied up at Meiggs wharf and it
was not until 10 o'clock that the turning
of the tide calmed the sea down so that
tl c little vessel could safely venture along
side the steamer. By that time Deputy
Surveyor Kuddell had been reached
by telephone and had given orders to put
inspectors on beard.
'I he Hartley anain went out to the
China, and from the purser it was learned
that she brought 100 passengers, 32 being
cabin and ttie rest steerage, 4<J being
Chinese and 19 Japanese. Two days out
of Yokohama a Chinese woman, who bad
taken passage at Yokohama, was stricken
with braallpox, and was at once put in
quarantine, all precautions b<mie taken to
prevent the spread of the disease.
No other cases developed, and the rest
of the passensers were in good health.
Dr. IlOÃPiiau ol the United Slates Quar
antine Office, who went out on the Hart
ley, gave orders to Inspectors O'Connor
and Bagley who were placed on board
that no person or article of any descrip
tion, except the relief for the customs in
spector*, was to leave or enter the shit)
until an examination can be made this
morning. Three inspectors went on board
at midnight anl tnree more will follow
to-day, mating eight Custom-house men
in ail who will stand the quarantine with
the passengers, ship's crew and the pilot,
who is also to be kept on board until the
allotted time is over.
As the case developed ten days ago and
was at once isolated the passengers will
only be compelled to remain on board
about five days, unles in the meantime
other cases develop. The ship will be
taken to Ansel Island and disinfected,
the mails being landed as soon as they
nave been fumigated. Among the cabin
passengers is Colonel M. R. Jeffers, an en
gineer who bas been building railroads in
China and who is here to buy materials
for his roads.
The China mada the trip from Hong
kong in 23 days, and was 12 days 18 hours
and 53 minutes from Yokohama.
EFFECTS OF THE BLOW.
Some Vessels on the Bay Had a
Rough Time Yesterday.
The big blow that began early yesterday
morning caused vessels on the bay to go
through all sorts of antics and more than
one had narrow escapes from injury.
The bark C. D. Bryant was lying off
Folsom street In ballast when one of the
heaviest squalls struck her. Her main
sail and foresail wera hanging loose in the
gear and the wind struck ncr full force
from ihe southeast. The flood tide tripped
her until her yar'iarms were almost in the
water, and the frequenters of the water
front, remembering the case of the Blair
more, thought she would capsze. Tbe
ballast in her, however, was sufficient to
keep her from keeling over and alter the
squall she righted.
It was under just such circumstances,
except that she had little or no ballast,
tliat the Blairmore capsized and sank,
carrying several of her crew to death.
Many ships had both anchors down,
and < yen then drifted In the blow.
The bark Eveshum Abbey drifted nearly
a mile toward Arcu Rock irom her an
chmage off Black Point.
The schooner Antelope turned back
after trying to get outside, and reported a
terrific wind and sea.
Tbe sctiooner Twiliu'ht came in from the
north coast ami reported that she had
been compelled to run for five hours under
bare poles.
The bitr four-masted British ship Gif
foid has joined tbe fleet of idle vessels in
Oakland Creek.
A rather peculiar accident occurred on
Tuesday last on the Dark Gatherer that
sailed yesterday in ballast to Tacoma to
load coal for this port. Tne main topgallant
mast was beinsr hoisted into its place and
had reached a position many feet above
the deck when 'he mast rope parted, and
the stout stick came down like an arrow.
The fore and after hatches had been piled
on the main hatch, and the spar struck
end on in the middle of the stout planks,
piercing them as though they were
paper and pitching down into the hold,
where it struck the bullast. This pre
vented it from injuring the vessel's skin,
but it was some time before the stick could
be cut out of the splintered timber that
held it and put in place.
The tugs Active and Reliance took the
steamsh.p Australia from Pacific street to
the sugar refinery in the lace of the blow
and had a hard job of it. Tho Active hooked
on to the starboard side of the Australia
aiid between ttio force of the wind and
waves parted her lines and tore a chock
out of the steamer. The Reliance held
her however until the Active could get a
fresh hold ana the steamer was hauled to
her berth in safety.
At the meeting of the Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday the contract for the 170
piles for Vallejo-sireet wharf was let to
James A. MrMann for $193, this being the
lowest bid. Tbe highes; was that of the
ban rrancisco Brid_e Company, $1360.
Edward R. Bwain, the architect lor the
new ferry building, made a demand for 5
percent on the additional $30,220 of ex
ien-fc that has been decided on for the
building. The matter was laid off for a
week.
SALOOtf-KELPER SCORED.
A Charge of Grand Larceny Against a
Schoolgirl Dismissed.
Josie Porter, the schoolgirl living at
219 Dore street, charged by C. J. Lynch, a
saloon-keeper on Twelfth and Folsom
streets, with stealing his gold watch, ap
peared in Judge Campbell's court yester
day. She was represented by Attorney
Graham.
Lynch on taking the witness-stand said
he could not swear tuat the girl stole the
watch, but he missed it after she left the
store. He denied t-elhng her any liquor
and also denied that two women were in
the bar drinking at the time the girl was
there.
Judge Campbell in dismissing the case
said:
"Before you have a schoolgirl arrested
for grand larceny, you want to investigate
your case more carefully. Here is a little
girl who goes to school every day brought
into a Police Court and charged with a
felony. It is a serious thing to charge a
person with a crime like that. You
ought to know wnat you are doing before
you cause a warrant to be iÃeued ior a
child like that.
"If it bad been some drunken man or
loafer it would perhaps be different, but
here is a girJ without a blur or blot upon
her name charged on the records of t. is
court with grand larceny. You caused
the variant to be issued charging her w.th
a felony. Let this be a lesson to you iv
the future.
"Pay attention to your business your
self, and don't allow children in your
place. I tlo not want to encourage it; 1
do not think it is a proper thing to do to
bring babies into the Police Court and
charge them with a felony. Ido not want
any more of that here, i ou say you do
not Know she took the watcn. Lat the
case bs dismissed for failure of proof."
Lynch wiil now have to answer a charge
of selling liquor to a minor.

for what was then said to be & round
million dollars. It was the luckiest sale,
so it is believed, tdat ever took place in
the Northwest, for immediately there was
afearful slump in land and lot values and
the purchase fell all to pieces.
With his million Mr. Bennett returned
to Tacoma. He was already wealthy with
his other possessions. He owned the Ta
coma Hotel, was a heavy stockholder in
banks and baa much inner property of
different Hinds. He bought the Tacoma
Dai y Ledger, the oldest paper in that
city, and conducted it for two or three
years, until it was finally tranaterred to
other hands.
Since business has grown dull in Ta
coma Mr. Bennett has become interested
in a gold pioperty in Northern Cilifornia,
which for some .rt!e time he has been cle
ve.oping. Several j'eara ago he became
interested in a gold property in Montana.
Yesterday be had a long talk at the
Palace wiih Eliiah Smith, the president
of the Oregon "Railway and Navigation
Company, who is here from New York, in
regard to the time when they were both
in the Northwest. At the time W. C.
Squire was making his fight for the
United States Senate from Washington
Six years ago Mr. Bennett was promi
nently mentioned for the place. The
tunnel which he bored through the Cas
cade Mountains is nearly two miles long.
Mr. Bennett saya he is here ou private
business and will only remain till this
evening.
"There is a little improvement in busi
ness at Tacoma," he said. "It is slight,
but some can be noticed. Things are on
a more solid basis. A good deal of devel
opment is going on in the mines. There
nas been a good deal of interest in the
mines in what was recently the Colville
Indian reservation. This mining district
is directly south of the new mining dis
trict in British Columbia that is attract
ing so much attention, and ought to be
just as good."

How irritating a cough becomes and

best thing that was ever discovered
for curing and preventing coughs,

during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid ,
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high LarometrJc pressure and
is usually accomrjanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompHnied by cloulv weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When :he pressure is high In this interior
and low along the coast, and the Uobars extend
north and couth along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south 01 Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weÂ«ther may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition*
wlilTjduce an>pposite result.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. IS. J
The action of the City Council of last
night, in voting down the proposition to
submit the Sunday-closing question to the
people may have a marked effect on the
earning election.
'\ For two years the advocates of Sunday
closing, which movement originated be
fore Rev. Dr. Ilader went to San Fran
cisco," have been making an earnest fight
gain their desired end. Two years ago
tjhey claimed a majority of votes in the
Council in favor of their proposition, but
jrbwi me matter came to a vote a techni
cality arose of which advantage was taken
ty arose of which advantage was taken
L'.-.J the matter was forgotten after the
election.
A few. weeks ago* the matter was pre
sented to the Council by means of a peti
tion asking that the question be sub
rnuted to the people at the coming elec
tion, and the Christian Endeavorers and
allied bodies received encouragement
â sufficient to justify them in believing that
'.i lie question of Sunday closing will be on
tire ballot.
â  â¢.Last night, however, two of the men,
M<s-srs. Manuel and Mott, on wi om they
depended, and who go out of office next
month, voted against the Sunday-closing
question and it was lost, and only the
â¢question of totally closing the saloons will
go before the people.
As soon as the result was known the
vote was announced at the Munhall re
vival meeting at the First Presbyterian
Church, and when Dr. Coyle made the
announcement he denounced the Council-
Ecn. in forcible language. He Â«aid they
had pledged themselves to individuals to
submit the question to the people, and
had histrucied the City Attorney to pre
pare the election proclamation submit ing
ihe question, &nd had backed down at trie
.last moment.
Dr. Co. Ie declared that the result was
due to a feeling that the citizens would
..vote overwhelmingly to close all saloons
gn Sunday, and that by submitt.ng the
prohibition clause instead, many people
â¢ would refuse to vote for it thai would
1 have favored Sunday closing.
The pastor called on all present to place
themselves on record as displeased with
the action of the Counc.l and at the same
rue to pledge themselves to do all in
their power to carry the prohibition pro
vision. J
â¢ At the close of the meeting almost every
individual in the church arose and ap
pJauded. Dr. Coyle will speak on the sub
ject next Monday morning and other
clergymen will also take up the campaign,
1 wnicn will be continued without cessation
until the election.
The Christian Endeavorers have an
nou.cel their intention of v hiding their
allegiance to a man who will favor their
views on Sunday closing end many of
: tii em have stated that they will desert the
men who sustained the Council men who
opposed them and will support Rev.
Mr. Goodenou.h for Mayor.

A MOVE FOR A CHARTER.
Governor l'.urid's Veto Gives an Argu
ment in Favor of Calling Together
a Board of Freeholder*.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 18.â George F.
Weeks, editor of the Encinal, attacks the
veto of the bill by Governor Build allow
in- cities of the lifth class to deal with
tneir own affairs in tne matter of main
taining electric light works and selling
the product to private consumer?, and ap
peals to the citizens of this city to frame a
charter for adoption in 1899. He urees
action at once in the matter, in order thai
every step may be taken with considera
tion and the work not hurried. He then
adds:
Instead "of going along, year atter year,
under a general lew relating to cities of tne
filth class, it would be much better for this
city to avail Itself of the constitutional pro
vision relating to municipalities, and frame
and adopt * freeholders' charter for its own
government. In view of the Dosuibility of such
a thing and upon its own motion aud without
consultation with any of the gentlemen
named, the Encinsl suggests the following
named citizens and freeholders as competent
ana amply qualified in every respect to lormu
la;e a charter for this city. The names are a-i
follows: E. B. Mastick, F. \V. Van Sictlen,
Columbus Bartlett, J. B. Vosburg, R. J. Van

of the Miners' Association, held Tuesday
evening in the Union League Club rooms,
do not convey with a clearness satisfactory
to tne members the real situation ts re
gards mining bills now before the Legis
lature. Exactly staled, the situation at
present is as follows:
Bills were introduced simultaneously by
Senator Prisk of Nevada, in the Senate,
and by Judge Soward of Sierra, in the
Assembly. The Soward . bill promptly
passed the Assembly and went to the
Senate. There it was referred to the
Finance Committee, where it still rests.
At the request of Senator Prisk the Sen
ate Committee on Mines ana Mining re
ported a substitute for his bill, which sub
stitute is now pending in the Senate, being
on the second-reading file.
Tic Senate Finance Committee desires
to report certain amendments to the As
sembly bill, while the advocates of the
Dill in the Assembly tear that the amend
ment of the bill in the Senate might jeop
ardize its approval by the Assembly upon
its return to that body.
At Tuesday night'? meeting a compro
mise was reached, whereby it wns agreed
that the Assembly bill should be amended
in certain matters of detail, provided the
two â ouses could be persuaded to pursue
that c ourse.

on record against convict labor in general,
and openly discussed and denounced this
great evil and menace* to free industry which
organized labor throughout the United States
has been persistently fighting lor years; and
whereas, mere seems to be come doubt in the
minds of many persons, notdlrectly concerned

whole desires to co-operate with the said
Manufacturers' Association in Us efforts to
restrict and us far as possible control prison
labor, through legislation now pending in

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1897.
A SCORCHING FOR
THE FACULTY
Berkeley Professors Criti
cized for Lack of
Interest.
Pointed Words in an Eiitorial
in the Current Occi
dent
Comparisons Between the Instructers
at Stanford and at the State
University.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 18.â In a
scorching philippic the Occident, which
has for twenty-rive years been the official
or^an of tne student body at the State
University, assailed the faculty to-day on
the ground of its disinterestedness toward
the student body and its long-distance
policy as regards student affairs and stu
dent enterprises. It draws a line of com
parison between the Berkeley faculty and
the faculty at Stanford as regards the en
couragement of student activities a:id the
fostering of college spirit. The Glee Club-
Football Team baseball game, which was
played last Saturday, was taken as the
nucleus for the fusillade upon the faculty.
The following is what Editor James Hop
per has to say :
Such institutions as the annual baseball
game between the Glee Club and the football
team should be highly encouraged by tho
student body, it is such customs, s.*on haloed
with a hazo of tradition, which differentiate
one college froiii another, make up college
life. They draw ;ho students together in one
bond oi interest, give them one common
ground for reminiscences, pleÃsan: memories,
do incalculable service in {ottering College
spirit.
It Is highly characteristic of Stanford Uni
versity that faculty anil students should unite
once a year in the baseball game between the
faculty ami the senior class. It is equally
characteristic ol Californiaâ and we deplore
the fact â that such a game is totally out of the
question; that the very though; of It is a pro
fanation.
The faculty as a whole â tnere are several
and grateful individual exceptionsâ sees it fit
to keep aloof from the sfudeut body, is ]><>>-
of intense dread oi losing dignity,
perches high up in a cloud of pomposity.
We deem this situation eminently regret
able. The professor is not now what he was
in the middle ages. He does not preach so-
VICE-PRESIDENT MRS. PAUL J. LOHSE, Who Is Actively
Working; for the Success of the Woman's Exchange.
norously from an inaccessible pedestal. The
modern' professor should be a friend of h:s
scholars, a co-worker possessed of greater
learning, experience, of more elevation, than
his pupils, but still v co-worker, directing the
efl'orts of youthful minds, suggesting, ming
ling with them in the fraternity of a common
aim.
To do this successfully a professor must bo
disinterested with no part oi coileg<" life, must
not keep aloof in a false sense of dignity.
Wo reieat it: Then are many Individual
numbers of the faculty who do mingle with
the students, and these are respeoted all the
more for it. But there is a decided tendency
for the faculty ns a body to withdraw fr< rri
the common gtudeut mob, to build around
Itself its own little Chinese wall ol mistaken
decorum. We deplore the fact, think it has
much to do with our avowed lack of college
spirit. The faculty could. If it wished it, do
much to unite the different component parts,
could and should be the keystone of the great
university arch.
It is not known how the faculty will
take this scoring, as the paper is fast
fresh from the press. It Is well known,
however, that to -ome of them the ques
tion of their spirit in fostering college en
thusiasm is a very tender point, and any
toucn upon it brings forth a proportion
ately greater response.

Dan Stuart Writes Mr. Goodman That
Many Will Buy Regular Tickets.
The railway conductors of the National j
Association of Conductors, who have their
beadquartcs here, were yet in session
Wednesday at the Grand Hotel. It is the j
annual meeting of the conductors, and at '
such times if there are any grievance-! I
they are formally presented, to be talked
over and corrected, if possible. There ap
pear to be no grievances. This has been
the situation, as understood, since their
meeting.
Delegates are here from Ogden, Los j
Angeles. Sacramento, Wadsworth, Port
land, this City and other points. Gen
eral Passenger Agent Goodman says that
no communications from the conductors
have been received at this time. He com
mended the association as a useful organi- j
zation.
"Ihis is the occasion of the annual
meeting," he said. "As the association
is National in character it has many |
thousands of members. It is a good thing, I
because it gives a certain protection, has i
a system of insurance and is calculated if |
a man gets out of a job to help him to get
another. In this way it is considerable
advantage to the members."
About the tickets to the Nevada mill
and the other latest particulars relative to
it, he said :
"They nave not been put on sale yet, in
fact have not been issued, because there is
yet plenty of time to do it. We have
been holding off to see what Stuart is go
ing to do in regard to that tournament at
Carson, i bare received a letter from him
in which he said he thought he could let
me know by the 20th inst. I am receiv
ing letters from him every now and then
as something develops.
"He has written me that he thinks a
i pood many risiton to me right will come
, on to California, buying the regular ticket.
j This ticset from Chicago will cost $110 by
j tv.o routes thnt is to come on to Carson
from the East, and return by the South
ern P;ic:tic. To return by the Northern
I'iicilic wou'd cost $13 ">0 more.
"The reduced licnet irom Chicago to
; Carson will be rood for twenty days, and
by jaying $10 00 aad;tional each way ihe
holders can, if hey choo.-e, also visit Cal
ifornia. Tins ticket is good for twenty
days. The other is good for many
months."
TBOUBLES OF THE UNA.
Departed From Panama Without Clear
ance Papers and Incurred a Penalty.
The master of the American schooner
l"ua has had not a little trouble since
making his last trip to Panama. While
in that port, after getting his cargo, he
found that there was likely to be a delay
and more or less annoyance in getting hia
â  papers, so he waited ouly for , a favorable
breeze and sailed away without his papers.
When the schooner entered this port the
master was embarrassed by not having a
bill of heaith irom the foreign port or his
clearance papers. Under the circum
stances a conditional entry was made and
Collector Wise sent to Washington for
iurther instructions. The only real offense
to this Government was iv entering with
out a bill of healtn. While the maximum
fine is $5000, it is more likely that the Una
will be iet off with a $20 penalty. Should
tne vessel ever go back to the United
States of Colombia the fine for leaving
without clearance papers will no doubt
equal the value of the vessel.
A YEAR'S ACTIVE WORK.
The Woman's Exchange Circu

in a Practical Way.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
DOB Broadway, Feb. 18. )
The Woman's Exchange of this city has
been dome a good work since its organiza
tion, about four years ago, and although
it has met with some reverses, it has been
the means of finding a sale for thousands
of dollars' worth of women's work, which
they could not otherwise, except under
great difficulty, have got before the pub
lic.
Mrs. Paul Lohse, vice-president of the
exchange, and her fellow-directors have
been so encouraged by recent additions to
the membership that they have decided
that the work shall continue, ana i>e more
vi orous and extensive in its operations
than previously.
'1 hey have decided to give a private the
atrical entertainment after Easter, and
there is no doubt tiiat with the social
patronage that would be extended to such
an effort the financial result would be
very marked.
The following ladies have added their
nanie^ to the membership roli: Mesdames

The treasurer's report for the past year
gives a very clear idea of the value of the
institution. The total receipt from >ales
were $7050. Members gave In fees $112.
Frederick Warde'a lecture produced $146,
nnd the total receipts for the year were
$7490. Of this amount $6353 went to the
women whose work was sold. The rent
of their quarters is $250, and their super
intendent and bookkeeper for the year
cost but $468.
The must unique item in the report is
this: "Lost by burclar, $4." The total
disbursements were $7338, showing a bal
ance on hand of $153. The number of
ladies who consigned work to the ex
change was 146, which represents an
average receipt for each consignor of
about $45.

WORKING TO GET
THE STATE FAIR
Merchants Anxious to Prove
the Necessity of a
Change.
The New Racetrack Piaced at
Their Disposal Free
of Cost.
Willing to Undertake the Responsi

From the State.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 18. j
An informal meeting of the directors
of the Board of Trade was held to-day
for the purpose of furthering the move
ment to transfer the annual State Fair
from Sacrameuto to this city.
Although the matter was only broached
to the Legislature yesterday a great deal
of quiet work has been done and instruc
tions were sent to the Alameda delegation
to-day asking them to prepare and intro
duce the necessary bill as soon as possible,
as sentiment in this city was a unit in fa
vor of the transfer.
One of the strongest areument3 put
forth by Oakland is that if the fair be held
here it can be made a financial success
without the necessity of an appropriation
from the State.
Thomas ti. Williams has already prom
ised, free of cost, the use of the Oatlana
Trotting Park and when this subject was
mentioned to him he said that should the
fair be held here his officials should receive
orders to give all the assistance possible
to the fair directors.
"There is but one sentiment in this
city," paid Secretary Sharp of the Board
of Trade this morning, "and that is in
favor of bringing the State Fair here. A
necessity exist- to make the fair what it
was intended to be. an exhibition of the
products of this State for the purpose of
encouraging competition and recognizing
merit.
"For many years the State Fair has
been chiefly a neat of fakers with a little
horse-racing on the side. We have proved
how to run an exposition and make it
pay, and the State Fair, if held here,
would be attended by many more people
than go to Sacramento, and it would De
run so as to help and foster the products
of California.
"The same methods that have been
used in our annual exposition, and which
have proved a financial success, would,
on a larger scale, also make a State affair
successful. During the time of the fair
the heat at Sacramento is unbearable, and
many people nre kept away on that ac
count. In Oakland it is very different
and the temperature is all that could be
desired."
President Witcher of the Merchants'
Exchange, President J. P. Taylor of the
Board of Trade, <i. \V. Ari er, Mayor Da-
Tie. George L. Fish, M. J. Keller and
many other leading citizens have already
added their indorsement to the scheme.
An Army Demonstration.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 18.â The Inter

The barracks was crowded, and the in

highly interesting. Those who took part
In the demonstration were all dressed in
appropriate costume, and the stage pre
sented a very cosmopolitan appearance.

The annual report of Louis Welnmann,
the retiring secretary ana treasurer,
showed tbat the affairs of the association
:ire in a flourishing condition, there being
181 members and a good balance of funds

According to cnstom the frailties of
members and the humorous incidents pe
culiar to the business during the past year
were most happily embodied in the asso
ciation's paper culled the California Knap
sack, edited' and read in manuscript by
George F. Grant, who kept the assemblage
in a roar of laughter for nearly an hour.

Purchased by a Syndicate for a Colony
of Farmers Who Crme to This
State F.oai lowa
A sale of real estate in Ban Luis Obispo
County was completed yesterday, the con
sideration being $2iO,<XK) for lands aggre
gating about 23,000 acres. The facts are
supplied t>y Wendell Easton of Easton,
Eldridge & Co., by whom the deal was

J. T. Murphy ranch. The owner was J. T.
Murphy. The purchaser is the representa
tive of a syndicate, but his name Mr.
Eldridge said he did not care to mention
yet.
Mr. Eldridge continued to say that the
purpose of the purchaser is to subdivide
the l.mds, which will be occupied by lowa
families â perhaps fifty families in all.
The tract embraces 13,200 acres ol the
Ascunaion ranch and 11,000 acred of the
Cascadero ranch. The lands adjoin. They
are on the line of the coa3t route of the
Southern Pacific, being near Paso Ilobles.
The soil is adapted to grain and fruit raia
insr, and a large tract is fine grazing land.

extension of the Southern Pacific line has
stimulated inquiry for land, making it
available. Mr. Eldridge also believes that
this marks the revival of a demand for
good California land.
INDIANS AGAINST COLLEGIANS.
IMute Nine to Play Stanford Varsity at
San Jose To-Murrow.
The Piute Indian baseball team from
Nevada will go up against the Stanford
Varsity nine at San Jose next to-morrow
afternoon. It will be the first game of the
season for the collegians, who havo only
just begun to work into shape for the
three annual championship games to be
played with the University of California
two months hence.
Beckett, a froshraan, will pitch. He is
one of the possibilities for the Varsity
box, which is the only place that Stanford
is not strong in at the opening of the sea
son. It is likely, however, that Captain
Thompson will give up fielding and be
the Varsity pitcher before the season
closes, for he lias had experience as a
high-school twirler and has more speed
than the others.
The Indians have played several matches
already in and about San Francisco, and
have shown considerable ability as expo
nents of the National game.

BUTLER WANTED
TO GO ASHORE
He Was Very Eager to
Leave the Ship With
out Delay.
Captain Fraser Testifi d to This
Effect at Yesterday's
Hearing.
Further Evidence Will Bs Taken
To-Day, and the Argument Is
Set for Thursday.
When Commissioner Heacock took his
seat in the United States Circuit Court
yesterday afternoon to resume the hear
ing on the application for the extradition
of Richard Ashe, alias Butier, Attorney
Cormac stated that both the Preston and
the Lee NVeller charges would be taken to
gether, tne same evidence to serve in bo;h
cases in the absence of any objection.
The gloom of the subsequent proceedings
was rarely relieved by any gleam of real
interest, anu Mr. Black's additions to his
list (if objections were, therefore, alrno-t
welcomed by tlie spectators as a tienuine
diversion.
Captain Fras-er of the Swanhilda virtu
ally retold ihe si^ry of his connection with
the prisoner from the date when the latter
Signed the ship's articles at Newcastle till
the morning of vh e arrest :n the bay of
Â£an Francisco. Mr. Biaek's objections
followed rapidly, one upon the other, as
the witness described his interview wiin
the second officer of the steamer Taupo
fifteen uavs oui from Newcastle, reia:;ve
to the B\ue Mountain murders. "Tiie
s- cond officer," said Captain Fraser,
"came to me on the rioop and said â "
"1 object," cried Mr. Black, "to what he
said.
"What did you say?" queried the
court.
"He was the first to speak, your
Honor," the witness explained. "He
gave me the newspaper containing the ac
count of the muraer."
"I object again," cried Mr. Black, "to
what the newspaper said. 1 '
"In consequence of what I read in the
paper," coniinued the witness, "I said 10
the tfherr: 'The po.ice must be on the
v. rong track; tliere is no man on my arti
cles namea But.er.' He left me an un
opened bundle of papers, which I
aiterward examined. The nrst paper I
read contained Lee Weller's name."
â¢Now 1 move that be stricken out,"
said Mr. Black wearily.
The first officer. Captain Fraser re
sumed, after reading ihe papers, said:
"We have cot the man."
"Objection 10 what the first officer
paid." interposed the vigilant Mr. Black.
"Did the defendant ever speak to you
during the voyage?" as-ked Mr. Corniac
"Three evenings beiore we got in,"
replied the witness, "between 7 and 8
o'clock, I was in my chartroom, when the
prisoner knocked at the door. When 1
opened it he asked me if I would let him
go ashore just as soon as we arrived. He
baid: 'You know how it is. It might be
the means of my getting a good situation
ii I could get ashore without it being
known that I was here before the mast.'
1 told him he could go ashore the moment
we got in."
The witness then cave an account of the
arrest and stated that the mate called his
attention at the time to a soil hat worn
by the prisoner with thÂ«j brim turned
down over his face. . The prisoner usually
Wore a small hat. In :he opinion of the
witness the prisoner knew nothing about
the Taupo's communication. <
The ship's articles were here produced j
and examined by the prisoner and Ins
counsel. These proved to be drawn up in
the usual form and provided for three
years' service within specified degrees of
laiitune.
Mr. Biack was solicitous to know the
exact position of the bfaip Swanhildaat
tlie lime of the arrest, and the witness re
plied that she was well within the heads
and entirely tree from any wharf. He ad
mitte'i that the prisoner conducted hirn
seif well (luring ttie passage. It waÂ« cus
tomary lor sailors to wear all sorts of
hats, though they ilii not usually wear
the rim turned down intentionally. It
was because the prisoner wore his hat in
this fashion that the witness temporarily
missed him on the morn.ng of the arrest.
"Is it customary," asked Mr. Corniac,
"for a sailor to change his name?"
The witness said that ttiis fiequently
happened, aijd especially in Newcastle,
where sailors who had deserted would do
this in order to get a license.
The witness soon afterward left the
stand and Mr. Black addressed the court.
He stated that Mr. Cormac had formerly
consented to allow him to examine his
transcription of the testimony hitherto
taken, but had afterward withdrawn that
permission on consultation with his col
leagues. Ti;e prisoner, Mr. Black pointed
out, was a poor man without, means, and
he, Mr. Black, would, therefore, ask bis
Honor whether counsel for the defense
could obtain a copy of the testimony
from any otner source.
The court said that the original deposi
tions and the oral evidence would be
placed in the custody of the court as goon
as they could be transcribed by the re
porter and that when tbia was done coun
sel could have access to them.
Mr. Black, on the understanding that he
might have forty-eif;ht hours in which to
prepare his argument, consented to allow
the testimony la the Preston case to be
admitted in the Lee Weller case.
Charles Wiicox, one of ti.e crew of the
ship Swanhilda, testified that the prisoner
borrowed his hat and put it on in the fore
castle before the ship reached the heads.
O :e side of the brim was always hanging
down. The witness did not s<Â»e the pris
oner wearing it a:terward, and he went
ashore in is own hat.
Mr. Black picked up the hat claimed by
Wilcox and demanded, "Ia that your
hat?"
"Yes," was the decided answer.
"Did it ever have any powciers in it T"
"\o, sir."
"If you wanted to disguise yourself,
would you â¢wear that hat?"
"Tastes differ," replied the witness
laconically, "'I wouldn't."
Detective McHattie was again called,
and â was told to examine the checkbook
found among the prisoner's baggage. He
recognized the name Leo Waller as the
prisoner's handwriting, but was sure that
the name Frank Harwooci had not been
written either by the prisoner or by Lee
Weller. He considered that the articles
found in the prisoner's possession were
very material evidence and to the beat of
his knowledge and belief they were the
proceeds of his crime.
'â¢How could this checkbook be of any
value in the prosecution?" asked Mr
Black.
"That would be hard to say at present"
"Is there anything else material upon
i!, except the name of Lse Weller, which
y>.Q admit is in the prisoner's handwrit
ing?"
"1 believe it was stolen from South Aus
tralia."
"Does South Australia own it?"
"1 believe it belongs to Frank Har
wood."
Mr. Clark continued vo badger the wit
ness with similar interrogatories, trying
hard to obtain a dennite reply as to
whether or not the checkbook was required
â â¢ evidence in ttie Preston and Lee Weiler
cases. The witness, however, was not
prepared to say anythine of the kind, and
merely repealed that it might prove use
ful in other cases. Mr. Black picked ud
several other articles and asked "Where
fore were they wanted?"
McHattie was eclectic and proposed to
use tbem all, but emphat-ized the neces
sity for the pre.-ence oi the certificates,
the ciothing and the photographs.
"Tne fact is," saM Mr. Black, "you
thins that when you get all the goods
back you may be nble to connect them
wnh some other crime "
Detective Roche was called to inform the
Ceurt of the respective distances of ihe
Chaisworth boaraing-house, Fa.conbridee
and New Hampshire from Sydney, New
castle and the localities wheie the bodies
of the murdered men were found. Con
stuble Conroy, who followed, said ihe
prisoner when he knew him wore a silver
watch and chain, and ihat the gold watch
and chain found amon: the prisoner's ef
fects clop-ely resembled those w*>rn by the
murdered Lee Weller. The witness also
stated that he obtained the prisoner's hat
from the forecastle when the arrest took
plsce, but did not examine it very care
fu !y.
Detective Egan deposed to the discovery
of the white powder inside the stveatbund,
and expressed ttie opinion that the pack
age mub'. have lain there for some time,
as it wms pressed quite flat.
A. McÃoy.e, a licensed pharmacist, com
municated tl>e result ol an atia.ysis ol the
powder in question. He had made, he
said, a c inclusively satisfactory test, in
accordance with his expeiience of thirty
Â»years, and upon learning that the powder
mi-'ht be material evidence in the case lie
applied what was known as the color test,
which was so tine and accurate that the
smallest fr.ic:ion of a grain could b^ de
tected by it. H* found that the powder
contained six or seven grains of stryen
nine â enough to kill five men. The small
est dose known to be fatal was a haif
grain.
Mr. Black intimated that the defense
had no testimony at the moment. He
might have to asK the deiendaiit some I
qu>-stions later.
The hearing of further testimony in i
both cases was then continued till tbis |
afternoon nt 2 o'clock, with the under- |
standing that argument will be>;iu next j
Thursday.
THE POLYCLINIC OPEN

Mount Z on Hospital on
Stockton Street

tend Patients at Merely Nomi
nal R.Vips.
The new polyciinio, established under
the auspices of the Mount Zion 110-pital,

will prove very beneficial, judging from
the popularity of ihe hospital. The latter
has accommodations, properly speaking,
for ten patients and there are now fourteen
installed there.
At the P.jlyclinic, which is patronized
by all the Hebrew rabbis and residents,
albeit it is non-sectarian in character, a
large number of eminent physicians have

THE SUPfiEME COUBT.
The Bill for It* Enlargement Under
Careful Consideration.
The Justices of the Supreme Court and
the committee of the Bar Association held
another meeting Wednesday to discuss the
proposed legislative bill for the enlarging
of the Supreme Court.
One point agreed upon was for three
District Courts of Appeal with three
Judges each instead of one Appellate
Court with five Justices.
The matter of jurisdiction of the several
courts was also agreed upon, the Supreme
Court to nave superviiory control over the
Appellate courts on.y in case-* of ciash of
decisions, writs of ruandnte, prohibition,
etc. One fection, if approved by the peo
ple, will <lo away with the necessity of
extra Superior judges in this City. It
provides that th?re may be as many ses
sions of the Superior Court as there arrÂ»
Judges to hold court. One of the pro
visions over wliicn there was much differ
THE SAN FRAXCTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1897.
ence of opinion was that providing that
the courts should not have under advise
ment at any on â¢ time more than ten ca^es.
Several were of the opinion that this would
not be practicable, owing to the court
being heM in different cities.
Another provision causing some discus
sion was that all cases must be orally
araued, am) it was agreed that oral argu
ment might be waived and the causes sub
mitted on briefs. Ii is expected that the
different point:- will be harmonised, so as
to submit the draft of the bill to the Legis

THOMAS COLLINS, Who Identifies Butler as a British Sailor
Named Ashe.
HE KNEW ASHE
AT COQUIMBO
Thomas Collins, Who Is an
Ex- Marine, Makes a
Statement.
Ashe Came Aboard the Triumph
From the Prison Ship
Liffey.
He Proved to Bi Always a Sociabi-
Person and Seemed Not at All
Like a Murderer.
It was stated in yesterday's Call that
two ex-marines named Thomas Collins
and John Conway, the first named of
whom once served on H. M. S. Triumph,
both knew Ashe, the man accused of the
Blue Mountain murders. Collins commu
nicated the following interesting particu
lars yesterday afternoon:
"My name is Thomas Collins and while
acting police corporal of marines I had
many interviews with 'Darky' Ashe. 1
first made his acquaintance at Coquimbo,
Chile. I was theu employed as au acting
ship's corporal, although 1 was a marine.
1 left England in H. M. 8. Triumph, which
â was to relieve the Swiftsure, then at Co
quimbo. We arrived May 1, ISBS. The
bwiftsure left for home on or about the
latter end of May or the beginning of
June. Several 'casuals' came aboard the
Triumph and among those who reported
for duty was this man Ashe, otherwise
called 'Darky' Ashe.
"The other vessels there at the time
were her Majesty's ships Heroine, Sappho,
sloop-of-war, and the prison ship Liffey,
which was always there. When these
'casuals' reported aboard it was my busi
ness to iniorm the officer of the watch:
'Sir, there are several casuals come aboard
from the Sappho, Heroine and Liffey to
report lor duty on H. M. S. Triumph as
flagship at this station.'
"The ofhcer of the watch would then
say : Go and acquaint the chief of police.'
"When the chief comes ur> he brings
his watchbook with him. On this oc
casion he finally reached Ashe. and to the
best of my recollection he said:
" 'What ship are you irorn?'
"Ashe made reply : 'The Liffey.'
"The ciiief asked: 'What department
â¢were you employed in on your last
vessel?"
"Ashe said: 'In the forecastle.'
"The forecastle men do not often go
aloft. A?he was continually under mv
observation in the police department until
I left the vessel, September 1, 1886. I
never knew detinitely why he was placed
on the prison slnjÂ«, but it was claimed tbat
Le was doing twenty-eight days on the
Liffey for stealing a midshipman's napkin
ring.
"Ashe was on and off until I left the
veesel September 1, 1Â»86. 1 visited the
Triumph in 1887, when she called at this
pert, but I never saw Aahe, though I was
never told that he wasn't there. He was:
always a sociable kind of a fellow and did
not Reen to be a man who would become
a murderer. I saw him to-day arid he is
the same man. With regard to the photo
praph, I would say that it is the custom,
when a photographer come? aboard, for
us to change clothes -with one another
and rig ourselves up in all shapes and
styles.
"I have a good many photographs of
this 'kind, and as nearly as I can recollect
the photograph you reproduced yester
day was that of 'Darky' Ashe. 1 "wasn't
quite sure at. first, because 1 only saw him
for a moment as he entered the Ap
praisers' building. When I saw him to
day be gave me the hearty grip one might
expect after a long separation.
"I said 'How do, "Darky"?' and he
said 'How do? 1
"Conway was his shipmate on H. M. S.
Sultan ki 1882, during the bombardment
of Alexandria, lie is now, to the best of
my knowledge, either on the Empire or
the Gipsy. He saw Asbe before 1 did and
told me about it. ' '"Darky" Aahe?' 1
asked, and he said 'Yes. 1 I saw him after
tbat and recognized nim.
"If you write to the Admiralty depart
ment, at Whitehall, London, and ask for
the list of men who served on board the
Sultan during the bombardment of Alex
andria you will get all the information you
desire regarding him."

DR. JAMES' ESTATE
IS THE PRIZE
Interesting Testimony Is
Taken in Judge Ccffey's
Court.
Bitter Attack Made Upon the
Character of Mrs. Laura
Milen-James.
Aspersions That Are Indignantly
Repudiated by the Little Woman
in tbe Case.
Judge Coffey's courtroom has been
crowded with women recently, for the
testimony in the case of Mrs. Laura Milen-
Jauies, who claims to be the widow of the
late Dr. Charles A. James by virtue of a
contract marriage, is growing interesting.
When women throng the judicial forum
it is safe to assume that something relat
ing to marriage or divorce is on the docket.
Mrs. James, as she is termed by her at
torneys, or Miss Milen, as she is called by
the lawyers who represent the kith and
kin of Dr. James, claims the $.SO,OOO estate
of the decedent on the ground that she is
his widow and the motner of his child.
Her opponents aver that her claims are
fraudulent, say that her so-called marriage
contract is fabricated and bogus, and
allege a conspiracy to get the property,
going so far as to declare that Dr. James,
who was an old man, was not the father
of the cnild produced in court, and at
tempt to show that lie had not met her
more than eight months before the birth
of the alleged heir. To controvert this
assumption the ostensible widow has in- j
troduced the testimony of herself and J
others to establish lor her infant a status, j
Mrs. Miien-James' character has not i
escaped in the general melee. An attack !
uas teen made on the ctiarge that she i
associated with several men, some old I
and some young, previous to and after j
her acquaintance with Dr. James.
All tnese things are indignantly rejmdi- j
ated by the little woman, and it is ad- ;
milted on all sides that through me terri- |
bie ordeal of the tiresome, rasping court
proceedings she has borne eraelf in a
cr dituble manner, which has won for her '
the respect of ail spectators.
Mrs. Saran Jane Williams testified that
she had known Dr. James since 1870. He !
often visited the house where she was liv- j
ing. He went there to call on Judge Hud- !
son. A short time before his death she j
talked with him and jestingly remarked
that she and the Judge had bean wonder
ing what had become of him; that they
did not know whether he had oeen sick or
had been off gettine married, like young
boys of bis age were apt to do. He *aid
no, that he had not been sick nnd i ad not
been getting married, as he had had
enoueh of that. The next time she saw
him he was dead. She heard no exclama
tion of mourning in the room where he
lay a corpse. She saw Mrs. Laura Milen-
James in the room.
Henry Dickman, husband of Lulu Milen
Dickman, a sibter ot Laura Milan James,
testified that he authorized trie senuing 01
a telegram to Miss Mattie James, a niece
of the late Dr. James, informing her of her
uncle's death. He also authorized the
â¢tending of a power of attorney to Mattie
James, as he wished to be appointed her
representative here. His telegram told
her that she was trie principal claimant.
He was introduced by his w:te to his sis
ler-in-law Laura as "Mrs. Dr. James"
about ten days before the marriage, but
did rioi take it seriously.
Mrs. Sarah J. Zoilinger testified ihat in
18! M she kept a looping- house at -18 Leav
enwonh street. .She continued :
"Mr. and Mrs. Dickman first came to
my House on Sep:ember 16, 1894. The
Milens also were there in October. On
December 14, 1894, Mrs. Milen, Mrs. Dick
man and Laura Hilen were at my house.
In the evening they went out and came
back between 10 and 12 o'clock at night,
and with them were three gentlemen, who
remained all night. After that night Mrs.
Milen anil Laura left, and only returned
on the loth and 16tb to help Mrs. Dick
man to move her things.
"I did not see Mrs. Milen again until
the time that Dr. James lay deaa. As I
walked on Sixth street, near Market, 1
chanced to meet Mrs. Milen, and she
attked nio to accompany her to her then
home. As Mrs. Dickman had left owing
me some rent 1 was interested in ascer
taining where she lived. Mrs. Milen put
her hand on my shoulder and said, 'My
landlord is dead,' and she wanted to know
if the administrator couid put them out
of the bouse when they had paid their
rent until the middle of next month. 1
tola her they c^uld not if they had a re
ceipt. She kind of smiled and said they
'would have a receipt all right. '
"There were other people living at my
house at that time. Among them were
the Shafers, relatives of the Milens, from
San Jose. Others were named Green,
Jackson. Miller and Jones."
Mrs. Mary Gallagher testified that she
was in the house at 925 Howard street
when Dr. James died. "1 went into the
death chamber soon alter the doctor died
and found there Mrs. Milen, Laura Milen
and Mrs. Dickman. Mrs. Milen said that
she and Laura had just returned from the
theater and asked the doctor if there was
anything that he wanted and he said
'No.' Soon after that he died. Mr?.
Milen told the undertaker that they were
perfect strangers, ana that the doctor had
no relatives here. Mr*. Dickman told me
that it was too bad the doctor died, as he
was engaged to her sister. Laura was not
present when this remark was made."

demonstration of the affection of those
among whom the worthy couple have
spent the latter half of their lives.
It was a ;;atherin^ and a demonstration
notable in every way, and was affecting
not alone to tho^e in whose honor it toot
place. Stormy as was the night there was
a ihrong so great as to find difficulty in
moving about through the spacious halls
of the institute.
For nearly an hour Professor and Mrs.
Le Conte, standing on a platform in the
salon, under a canopy of fern;, snook
hands with those of their friends who
could get near them. Their daughter
Carolina aud their son Joseph N. were
with them.
A little later they took their places in
the balcony, where they could best be
seen and heard, and President Kellogg
presented the beautilul token to them, in
these words:
I have here a beautiful sift for those In
whcse honor this company is gathered. It is
a loving cup of pure gold. Inscribed with
j legends significant and appropriate. on one
of its three sides is the seal of the university,
on another the great seal of the State, and on
the third the gilt inscription, as follows:
! "This loving cup is a token of affection fr,om
I many hearts."
. In this gift the regents of the university tes
! tify their appreciation ot me man whom, in
j the very beginnings of the university, they
: called to teach the beat results of scientific
[ thought and investigation.
His colleagues, who have known him long
i and well, hereby express their admiration
I and love of the eldest and most distinguished
! member of the teaching mff. Tney take
i pleasure In calling to mind his varied acquire
ments, his clearness of thought, his tone and
, i euuiy of expression, his unfailing courtesy
! and Helpfulness, and the modesty with which
he wears his multiplying laurels.
The students whom lie has met during a
round quarter of a century hereby testify their
admiration and love of one whose lectures no
student was willing to miss, whose addresses
and writings have been a great*attraction of
their college life. Most of tuese students have
gone out into the world, but they retain their
fond regard for their favorite protessor. Others
there are who join in this testimonial. This
man has been more than a university pro
fessor. Ho has entered into the life of this
community and has become a name to conjure
by. Culifornians are proud of his National
unit trans-Atlantic reputation. His late visit
to the Eastern States and to England but
shown us how certain it is that w â¢â _â  own a fore
most man of science, a writer of renown, an
acknowledged authority in the higher ranees
of thought.
The climax of his recent visit was reached a
little more than a month ago, when, at the
home of a daughter, Dr. and Mrs. Le Conte
â were surrounded by all their children and
grandchildren, and celebrated their eolden
wedding. It was not simply the climax of a
sort of triumphal tour: it was the culminating
felicity of two long and singularly happy lives.
It was the crown of joy for the two Hie-long
lovers.
As a sequel to that occasion we present to
them to-night this loving cup, in token of our
most heartfelt congratulations. It is the
poeulum caritatis, me cup of grace of the old
English, monasteries, tne loving cup of the
modern time. In its use, dear friends, per
haps, you will think of the plaintive formula,
â  Bene vos; bene iioj. Long may you live to re
call this cveniug scene, to enjoy still the un
alloyed bliss of a true marriage of kindred
souls. We all echo the lioratiau benediction,
Seri in coclum redeatis.
The orchestra joined with the throng in
applauding the address and in greeting
Professor Le Conte as tie arose. He was
visibly affected.
"My friends." he said, "this kindness,
1 this generosity, thin affection, love, I
may say, of the faculty, of the resents, of
; the graduates and of the students of the
university â it overwhelms ma until 1
know not what to say.
It has culminated in this reception, an honor
which I cannot lake to myself, but share it
with my wife. It is certainly beyond my
merit. How can I account for it except that
deep down in the hearts of all there is a well
of Human kindness. I have been with you
from year to year, but you have still been
seeking occasion to shower it upon me, and
now this golden wedding has offered the occa
sion. I am glad that my wife may snare it
with me. :
la my connection wltn the university, at
I its very birth, I felt this same quickening in
fluence. I felt then as I feel now that it was
founded on more natural principles than any
other. I nave watched it Â«row until it stands
in the first rank of the educational institu
tions of the country. To have thus grown up
with it. is that not something to have lived
for?
Need I say that the crown of my honors that
you speatof lay in a happy married life ? It
is God's message. In such a life there is no
room for selfisnncfs. In a union so close there
is no room for "rights." How wo net about
rights. Duty itself Is a form of bondage. Love
is freedom. I accept this loving cup aa a
symbol of eternal and indissoluble union.
Governor Budd made a short address,
speaking as a graduate of the university
and addressing "Professor Joseph and
Mrs. I'rofessor Joe" as they "used to do."
He spoke of the bills for the support and
extension of the university that have just
passe.l the Legislature and of the pleasure
he would have in signing them.
The loving cup is a genuine loving enp,
with three handles, and is the largest
single piece of gold ever worked up by
Shreve. It is nine inches high by seven
across the handles. On the first face is a
raised wreath of green gold surrounding
the inscription : '"To Professor and Mr?.
Le Contf-, from the University of Califor
nia. 1547-1897." Underneath the wreath
is a raised oxidized gold ribbon upon
which is enameled in blue the Latin in
scription: "Faraa Semper Vivat" (May
your fame live forever).
On one of the other faces is a raised
seal in blue enamel and gold â the colors
and the seal of the University of Cali
fornia. On the third face in raised
oxidized gold is the great seal of the State
of California. The general color of the
cup is polished gold.
Telegrams were received from gradu
ates and others in many places through
out the country and a number o! floral
tokens, one of these from the pupils of Le
Conte school.
The case is covered with black goatskin
and ia lined with blue silk.

EMMANUEL MEYER
HAS ASSIGNED
All His Books Turned Over
to A. Vignier Yes
terday.
Business Stagnation and Former
Heavy Rent Were the
Causes.
$
Sixty Creditors, $31,000 Liabilities,
and Assets Gooj and Bad in
the Same Sum-
Emmanuel Meyer & Co., importers and
wholesale and retail dealers in groceries,
liquors and table cieiicacies, located in
business at 303 Sutter street, have failed,
and for the benerit of their creditors have
assigned to A. Vignier, the largest
creditor.
The liabilities of Meyerâ for, despite
the firm name, he has no partner â are
about $.'51,000, and the a?set'-, Â«ood and
bad, foot up the same amount.
A. Vignier is creditor to the amount of
about $tfooo, and the other principal credi
tors are the Anglo-Cslifornian Bank, D.
Myer, J. H. Wheeler, William Wolff and
I. Levy.
The assignment was made by the advice
of A. Ruef, Meyers attorney, and took
place in his ollice on Montgomery street
late yesterday afternoon. All the books
containing a record of Meyer's business
were turned over to Vignier.
There are sixty creditors in all, but to
some Meyer is in debt only slightly. His
own statement of the cause of the assign
ment is as follows:
"Five years ago 1 went into business on
Market, street, opposite O'Brien's. My
rent was $450 a month. I began to fall
behind and waited patiently for the lease
to expire, which occurred two years ago.
"Then 1 moved to 303 Sutter street where
rent was lower. Bat business stagnation
affected me so much that I had to assign.
I am now in the Hands of "my creditors.
I have done all in my power. I can do
no more."
BURNS MONUMENT FUND.
Knthuaiagtlc Meeting of thÂ« Mamben
of the Committeeâ Reports
Adopted.
There was an enthusiastic meeting of
the Burns monument committee of the
Caledonian Club in Scottish Hall last
ni<:ht.
The committee on mode of procedure
and organization appointed at the previous
meeting submitted its report, which
was read by Secretary Y. C. Lawson and
adopted clause by clause. It provides
that the officers shall consist of a presi
dent, vice-president, treasurer and secre
tary; that the committee shall meet in
Scottish Hall every Thursday evening at
8 o'clock and eight shall constitute a
quorum.
A supplementary report was adopted
recommending a mode of procedure toward
raising funds, as follows:
That we first receive subscriptions from the
members of the committee. That we canvass
the leading members of the community for
subscriptions in large sumÂ«. That we "then
hÂ«ve subscription books circulated through
out the Pacific Coast and make efforts to secure
popular subscriptions. That the committee
arrange during the year /or one or two enter
tainments in aid of the fund, said entertain
ments to be arranged upon a large scale, and
with the hope of realizing a very lartje sum of
money. Thai wits committee, wnile ack
nowledging the many courteous offers made,
will accept no benefits tendered until after the
celebrations airecily on its own account have
been held.
I). R. McNeil, president of the Caledo
nian Club, was unanimously elected vice

JOACHIMSEN WILL
FIGHT IT OUT
The Police Court Attorneys
Must Give Him His
Way.
Chinese Highbinders and Their
Counsel Still on the
Aggressive.
Heathen Gamblers May Have tc
Stand Upon Trial if it Takes a
Lifetim .
Judee Joachimsen held another levee
yesterday afternoon in his court.
The Chinese who were arrested last Sat
urday night in their hii;ubinder and
gambling resorts were there ju^t as they
were the duy before, with a determination
to thwart justice and make things thor
oughly disagreeable.
There were more than ten score of the
heathens crowded into the courtroom,
and they, like their feilow-defendants of
the day before, were ready to be con
tumacious in refusing to plead guilty or
otherwise.
Five defendants were called to the bar,
and iDterpretor Louis ix>cke translated to
them individually the complaint as tiled.
The court was obliged to take the same
course observed in the cases^of Lee Chung,
Wong Lung and Yee Chee the day pre
vious, culling for v jury trial, winch in
volves the attendance or nearly 500 tales
men to makeup the juries.
The breach between Major Smith, who
represents the Chinese, and ex-Judge
Louderback, who represents the prose
cution as special counsel, lias not closed.
Loud-rback refuses absolutely to try all
the delendauts at one time, because he
says that a conviction obtained that way
woutd be sure of a reversal or new trial
if appealed to the Superior Court. Hence
ho insists upon an individual trial or a
plea of guilty that would settle the cases
by the payment of a line.
On the other side. Attorney Smith ex
pects to clear his clients, and while he is
wilhnx to try any one of them as a test
to go for all. he declares ho will try each
man's case from the reading of the com
plaint to the Judge's charge to the jury if
the prosecution insists it should be done
that way.
The spirit of antagonism shown at the
present tiice between the contending par
lies must necessarily involve the expendi
ture of pome years of criminal trials in
Judge Joachlmsen's court it" those con
cerned stick to the line they have drawn.
This is true for the reason that no one
case can ba carried to a conclusion, with
the usual delays to which a defendant is
entitled, inside of a week, and there are
over 232 defendants now at the bar.
Jtidjre Joachimsen, in speaking of the
dilemma whicn threatens to block his
court, said yesterday :
â¢'Of course I am opposed to having the
affairs of ray court clogged. 1 want to at
tend to ilie affairs as they come along in
the usual way and work night and day to
do so if necessary. But in these cases it is
quite different. There is no necessity for
any clogging and I will not permit it if I
can do otherwise. The law requires that
the complaints be made separately and
they have been drawn in that wav, but I
do not see why it is necessary for the de
fense to demand the reading of the com
plaint in English and in Chinese in each
case. Then the defendant remains mute
and contumacious, compelling the court
to give him a plea of not guilty and a jury
trial.
"Such proceeding* sre wrong and the at
torneys tnemselves could avoid it. Still,
I am here as the servant of the people ana
if it is necessary 1 will continue to the
end of my term trying these Chinese
cases. I hardly believe that the attorneys
for the defense can, afford to do as much
for their client?. 1 '

EAGER TO PULL

Members of the Greek Colony
Are in a Warlike
Humor.
Proud of Their K ; ng and Their
Country and Ready to Die
for Both.
A Very Larce Gathering Is Exp cted
on Sunday From All Ov^r
the Pac fij Coast
A. J. Kosta, one of the leadinp spirits in
the patriotic movement among the Greek
residents of thi3 City, is a man who has
seen some service in various parts ot the
world. By virtue of a four years' connec
tion with the United States navy, as well
as by birth, he is fuliy entitled to speak
and to act in the name of a warlike cause.
Mr. Kosta left vis native city of Athens
more than twenty years ago, and worked
for some time on board the passenger
steamers then plying between England
and the East Indies. He joined the Amer
ican corvette Ticonderoga, Captain Crom
well, at Cape Town, a few years later, and
accompanied that vessel throughout a
long voyage, in the course of which he
visited nearly every port of consequence
in the Eastern Hemisphere. He settled
on the Pacific Coast in 1882, and has lived
here ever since, and has thiived under the
stars and strh.es. Tbongb his naval train
ing and protracted residence in the West
have made him a thorough American in
sentiment, be, iit:e the rast of his country
men in this narr of the world, has not for
gotten the ties of birth, and now that the
mother country reems destined to fight,
he has pledged himself to don a military
uniform, shoulder a musket and hasten to
her assistance 6hould recruits be really
needed.
"We were overjoyed to hear that King
George bad declared his intention of com
manding his forces in person," said Air.
Kosta last night. "It needed but that to
decide every one of us here to defend with
our blood, if need be, the integrity of our
country. I am receiving assurances of
sympathy and assistance from all
over the country â from Loa Angeles,
Sacramento, Fresno, Stockton, Yal
lejo, San Jose, from Portland, Or.,
1 and from Seattle, and we expect that
many of our countrymen from all these
plai'-es will be present at the bar.q-iet and
speech-making on Sunday evening.
"1 have also received a leiier from
Honolulu, where there are about hall a
dozen Greeks, pledging every man amon^
tbem to join our company when called
upon."
Of the six principal speakers, who will
address the meeting on Snnday, i>i their
native tongue, each man has selected a
separate aspect of the subject of which to
! treat. Vauvales, for t-zampie, will ex
plain the work of the Hellenic Mutual
Benevolence Society ant its connection
with the movement", while Kosta himself
will review the history of the Cretan
crisis and the attitude of the Greek Gov
ernment toward it. P. N'rettos, who
served for many years in the Greek army,
is regarded as the probable leader of the
prospective expedition, thou b, as yet, no
final arrangements have been made to
officer the company. Thu younger mem
bers of the Greek colony can scarcely con
tain themselves in anticipation of the
moment when they will, figuratively
speaking, taÂ«e the Turk by the beard.
Stelzner's Keply to Jeffries.
In reply to a statement of J. J. Jeffries which
Appeased in a morning paper. Jack stelzner
says that he stands ready to meet Jeffries at
any timo Mfter three wteKs troin to-day in a
ten-round boat >r in a contest to a finish.
Jeffries stated that Stelzner had co;d feet and
did not want to fi?ht him. This statement,
has warmed up the to- queror of Van Bus
kirk, end lie now bopes for a meeting with
Jeffries when he (Stelsnor) is in good physical
coudition.
Broke His Left Leg.
Fritz Kayser of the Coliseum saloon, 910

for pool games. During tne scuffle Kayser's left
leg was broken. He was taken to ihe .Receiving
Hospital in the ambulance.
NEW TO-DAT.'
g That hideous and deathly '
â tÂ«eÂ» &?* demon of sickness â constipa-
tion, is an easy enough thing to cure if I
you take the right medicine. Constipa- i
tion is one of the commonest things in the
world. It is really one of the most seri- \
ous things. Fully nine-tenths of all the j
ordinary sickness of mankind is due to !
this one cause. If you place an obstruc- i
tion in the gutter, it will stop the flow of
water, and gradually a mass of poison- i
ous, putrefying matter will accumulate.
That is exactly what happens in the
digestive organs when constipation be-
gins. Poisonous matter accumulates and
is forced into the blood. It goes all over
the body and causes all sorts of symp-
toms. A few of these are dizziness, flatu-
lence, heartburn, palpitation, headaches,
loss of appetite, loss of sleep, foul breath,
distress alter eating, biliousness and erup-
tions of the skin. These things are un-
pleasant, but they are not serious. The
serious things come afterward. Doctor
Pierces Pleasant Pellets are for the cure
of constipation. They are tiny, sugar-
coated granules, easy to take, mild and
efficient in their action. One is a gentle
laxative, two a mild cathartic. There is
nothing else in the world like them.
There is nothing that takes their place.
There is nothing "just as good, " although
lieing and unscrupulous druggists may
sometimes tell you so for their own profit.
Do you want to lose your health so that
the druggist can get rich?
