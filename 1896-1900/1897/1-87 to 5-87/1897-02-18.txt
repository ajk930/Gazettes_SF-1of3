Mayor Phelan yesterday sent a letter to
Colonel Ethan Allen of New York, who
originally requested him to co-operate
with the Cub; sympathizers here. He
notified Colonel Allen that he bad delayed
making the appointment for ten days or
more, awaiting the pleasure of Messrs.
Jones and Ma-cherini, who had the affairs
of the league in charge here. He inclosed
for Colonel Allen's perusal The Call's
list of itteemen and account of the
proeress of the movement, and concluded
by hoping that the 700 Mayors who have
been invited to co-operate would find
representative citizens to aid the cause ol
the oppressed by every lawful means. In
addition to this the Mayor stated that the
San Francisto committee had- been par
ticularly fortunate in inducing citizens of
known ability and standing to consent to
serve on the honorary committee.
A circular letter was at once prepared
and mailed to each of the foregoing gen
tlemen, conveying the official information
that their names were confirmed as au

thor'zed members of the committee.
It is probable that D. S. Ricnardson will
be made chairman of the committoe and
Daniel A. Me Col can secretary. The work
of the body is not aggressive, but is largely
negative, the greatest value being the
moral influence of the organization and a
list ol strong names.
"Professor Bolton Coit Brown of Stan
ford readily consented to act on the com
mittee," said Mayor Phelan yesterday,
"and I found him an enthusiastic sup-
Dorter ot the principles advocated by this
league. The list of nam?s submitted to
me to act is entirely satisfactory. I tind
many names of men of known standing
and markea ability, and men from nearly
all walks of life are represented."
Major W. Fahey of the Cosmopolitan
Hotel is one of the most enthusiastic
members of the committee. He says ft it
were a question ol battle he could soon
raise a strong company to do or (Me for
the struggling Cubans. "I shall do all I
can among the Irish," he said ye3terrlay,
"and I think every worthy son of old Erin
ought to realize the glorious ri-jht these
oppressed people are making for liberty.
The heart of the world beat* for the poor
women and children beaten by Spanish
tyrants and brutally put to death. Noth
ing can justify such outrages as we read
of daily in tne newspapers. As an Irish
man 1 say that The Call ought to be
written up as a friend of liberty for the
noble stand it has taken in this fight."
The following letter came from Seattle
yesterday and it shows the extent of the
feeling for Cuba on this coast:
Seattle, Feb. 12.
Cuban League, San â uenti.kmkn:
If there is thine I can do to aid you at this
distance please wire or write me without de
lay. I know many people here who stand
ready to give time and money to help the
Cubans. We will do everything within our
power and within the bounds of law. Sin
cerely, Walter S. INTER.
The committee will probabiy write to
Mr. Hunter and try to induce him to
organize a league at Seattle and have a
committee appointed there by the Mayor.
Many letters come to the committeemen
daily from people in other towns, who are
anxious to do something to aid the cause.
Efforts will soon be made to have leagues
started ail over the coast.
Thr next step in the local work will be
to get a hall and arrange for a mass-meet

straggling Cu!>ans. Attorney W. S. Scott,

ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 17.â Anti-
Turkisn disturbances have occurred in
Thessaly. Shots have been exchanged at
Artii, on the Turkish frontier, where a
Turkish guard across the border was
struck by a bullet.
Colonel Vasses, commanding the Greek
forces in Crete, has received instructions
from the Government to avoid any en
counter with the foreign forces on the
island, but to execute the orders of the
King, which are that he shall occupy the
island and restore order therein. The
Macedonian and Cretan committees have
arrived at an agreement to concentrate
their efforts in Crete to the end of secur
ing a union of the Island with Greece.
It is believed liere that detachments of
marines were landed from the foreign war
ships at Heraklion, Retiino and Sitla yes
terday, it being tue purpose of Vice-Ad
miral Canevaro of tne Italian navy, who
is in command ot the united naval forces
of the powers, to prevent attacks by the
Greek forces upon those places.
The provinces named are reported to
nave become less disturbed, and affairs
are returning more nearly to their normal
condition.
Colonel Vassos, commanding the Greek
corps of occupation, it is said, made no
opposition to the landing of the marines.
Prince Nicholas of Gree.e, iÂ» command
of a battery of flÂ«Â»<i artiliÂ«ry, started to

CORBETT AND HIS RETINUE ARRIVE AT CARSON.
A great crowd had gathered on the depot platform to get a glimpse at the famous boxer. Dozens of cameras were in readiness for "shots." Instead of
alighting on the platform, however, Corbett quietly slipped out of the rear exit of the last car and was on his way to the hotel before the crowd discovered how it had
been tricked.
[Sketched by a ''Call" staff artist ]
crowds of people gathered to witness the
departure of the troops and gave the
soldiers and their commander an ovation.
The belief prevails here that a diplo
matic conference will shortly be held in
Berlin for the purpose of settling the
question of the union of Crete with Greece.
It is expected that the matter will be de
cided in favor of Greece, and that Prince
George will be chosen prince of the island.
Later advices from Crete confirm the
rumors that detachments of marines have
been landed from the foreign warships at
Haraklion, Retimo and Slati. The officer
in command of the French marines who
compose the force of occupation at Reti
mo, the advices say, has issued a procla
mation to the inhabitants of that place.
CANEA, Crete, Feb. 17.â Vice-Admiral
Canevaro, commanding the Italian war
ships in Cretan waters, has been chosen to
command the combined naval forces ol
the powers in these waters as the senior
admiral of the united fleet. He has for
mally notified the commander of the
Greek squairon, Prince George of Greece,
of the occupation of the town by the ma
rines of the foreign warships, with the
consent of the Turkish Government. To
this notice the Italian admiral added the
Warning that the Greeks must not make
an attack upon the town, which is under
the protection of the flags of the great
powers.
As the result of n conference of the com
m: nders of the foreign squadrons, held on
board the Italian flagship to-day, Admiral
Canevaro sent a note to the Greek Consul
informing him that any attack upon the
part of Greece upon Canca, Reiirno, Sitia
or Heraklion would be repulsed by the
warship-i cf the powers. The Consul was
also warned that all further hostile action
on the part of the Christian insurgents and
the Greek troops in other parts of the isl
and must cease at once.
Vice-Admiral Cavenaro, commanding
the allied naval forces of the powers in
Cretan wators, has written a note to the
Greek Consul at this place informing him
that it is the purpose of the powers by
their occupancy of various cities of the
island to promote a bloodles3 settlement
of the Cretan difficulty, and that, there
fore, uny attack upon the towns occupied,
whether made by Turks or Christians, will
ba repelled by the united forces of the
powers. He also urges the insurgents
and Greeks to abstain from military ac
tion In other parts of the island.
The Greek Government having reopened
their consulate here has resulted in the
creation of an anomalous situation, and
the European commanders have notified
the Â« onsul that he must lower his fl;ig in
view of the hostility displayed by his
Government.
CONSTANTINOPLE, TrpKEY.Feb. 17.â
At a special meeting of the council of
Minis;ers it was decided to leave the paci
tication of Crete in the hands of the
powers. Military measures were adooted
by the Paslia. The Sultan has informed
the foreign diplomats that he is greatly
pleased at the landing of foreign marines
at Canea.
The Government has issued an order for
the mobilization of the Turkish fleet with
the least possible delay. This action is
taken to in licato that while the Sultan
has hopes of interference by the great
powers, he will be ready for the emer
gency should the expected action not be
taken.
The Sultan has appointed Jaratheodori
Pasha as Turkey's High Commissioner in
Cre'e.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey. Feb. 17.â
Tns Minister of Marine ln> r . asked the
Government for a credit of Â£500,000, Turk
ish, to defray the expenses incurred iv
preparing and mobilizing tne Turkish
fleet. Two squadrons are now being pre
pared. The first, which will comprise
four warships and ten torpedo-boats, will
sail within five days, under the command
of Vice-Admiral I'"a lk. The second will be
commanded by Vice- A imiral Hassan and
will consist of five warships and ten tor
pedo-boats. Fifty thousand naval reserves
have been summoned for service, in addi
tiou to the Redifs of the Tnird Army
Corps, now at Salonica, and the Redifs of
Trebizond have also been ordered to join
the < o'.ors, making altogether HBOO men
who will be concentrated near the Greek
frontier.
LONDON, Exg., Feb. 17.â The Daily
News will print tomorrow a dispatch
from Athens saying it is reported tttere
that a pert of the "corps of occupation"
commanded by Colonel Vassos to-day at-
tacked the town of Boncolion. The Turk
ish garrison, after a brief resistance,
yielded, and the Greek forces took posses
sion.
The Athens correspondent of the Stan
dard says that the insurgents on the island
of Crete are everywhere swearing loyalty
to King George of Greece. Five hundred
troofS started yesterday and landed on
the island of Crete to-day. Great quanti
ties of stores, provisions and munitions of
war are also being dispatched to Crete.
The foreign Ministers, the German repre
sentative excepted, have collectively ad
vised the Government to recall the fleet
and the troops, but this is not likely to be
done.
Two classes of the Naval Reserves have
heen called oat. The Greek ironclal
Spezia has arrived from Toulon. The

Athens to Crete to-nigh:. The Kalaruata
Regiment will follow to-morrow.

JULIAN SELECTS QUARTERS FOR
FITZSIMMONS.
The Antipodean Will Train at Cook's Ranch, Two
Miles From Carson, for His Battle With
the Doughty Athlete From
San Francisco.
GAKSON, Key., Feb. 17.â Jim Corbett
had his first look to-day at Shaws Springs,
the place chosen for him by his brother,
Harry, and Eddie Cooke, his advance
agent, for his training quarters. He was
delighted with the place. It was nearly
noon when the bi^ San Franciscan ex
pressed a desire to go out to the springs.
He was particularly anxious to ascertain
what progress had been made by the car
penters who are building his handball
court.
As over a foot of snow now covers the
streets of Carson and the road to the
springs, as the result of last night's
storm, sleighs were chartered for the trip
instead of carriages. Those who went
along with the champion were Harry and
Joe Corbett, Eddie Cooke, "Kid" Eagan
and several newsoaper correspondents.
The latter were jocularly informed by
Corbett that he bad not as yet heard that
any particular newspaper had secured the
exclusive right to send representatives to
the training quarters and all hands would
in accordance be welcome to go along
with him.
Shaws Springs is nearly a mile and a
half irom Car-on and the placÂ« is admir
ably adapted for just such purposes as
Corbett intend" to u^e it for. There is but
little difference between the altitude qf
this place and that of Carson, which is a
fact that had much to do with the selec
tion of the springs by Corbett's handlers.
Upon his arrival there James J.s atten
tion was first directed to the handball
court, which is now nearly finished. He
would have found it completed had not
the snowstorm of ye-terday driven off the
carpenters, but even in its present shaie
it pleased the. tall boxer.
"Gee, I only wish it was finished to
day," he said enthusiastically; "I would
just like to have a few rattling good gnmes
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
right now, and I'll bet I would beat tho
whole crowd of you."
"Except me, may De," said Joe Corbett.
"No, not except you, either," was the
hot retort. "You are an easy mark. I
can beat you with my eyes shut and both
ieet tired."
The boss carpenter informed the pugiliÂ»t
that his men were engaged in clearing tha
snow out of the court, and would resume
their work as quickly as possible.
"Don't you think that with a little
hustling you could finish her up Dy to-
morrow?" asked Corbett, with some show
of impatience.
"By to-morrow night, probably," was
the reply.
"But could not you get the court far
enough advanced so that I could play in it
to-morrow afternoon. There is something
extra in it for you if you do."
The hint at the tip had the desired
effect, and Jim was promised that he
would find things in good enough shape
for a game when he arrived.
Aline Host Slingerland t* en took the
champion In tuw and showed him ail over
the springs. First they went to tbe neat
little two-story cottage where James and
his trainers are to sleepdurin^ the coming
month's siege of training. The biz fellow
was delighted with the house and at once
selected for his private bedroom a cozy,
sunny little room in t: c south side of the
first floor. There are two bedrooms on
this floor and a sitting-room. Corbett
named ths latter the whistroom and re
quested the host to provide it with a card
table.
â¢'I wish we had room here for a billiard
table, too," sighed the champion.
"Plenty of room over in the hotel,' : said
Slingerland.
"Is there ? Well, that's fine. I'll hare a
table Bent out to-morrow."2
The natural hot baths which have made
Shaws Sprinps famous have no charms for
Corbett. At this lime of year, when the
atmosphere is so raw and biting, it is dan
gerous to indulge in these luxuries. Many
an indiscreet bather has been laid out v itn
pneumonia and Corbett has been warr.ed
regarding this. It has had the effect of
causing him to decide to eschew the baths
altogether. He said to-day that while he
considered himself robust enough to defy
the atmosphere he did not believe in tak
ing any chnnce3. He would not, he said,
risk any thing that might have a possible
tendency to prevent his meeting with Fitz
simmons. He only hoped that the Aus
tralian would be equally careful of his
health. Corbett intends to coutine bis
bathing to cold douches. He left orders
with Slingerland to have a big barrel
stilted up near the cottage, with a shower
room attachment.
Satisfied that everything was to his lik
ing at the springs and that he would be
happy there, the man who boasts that be
will thump all of the pugilistic aspirations
out of tioughty Bob Fitzsimmons re-en
teied his jingling sleigh and returned to
town for dinner.
The big lellow and his trainers arranged
to have the use of Armory Hall this after
noon for a couple of hours' exercise. This
was considered by every one in the party
an impouant step, as it would supply the
first evidence of Corbett's ability to en
dure violent work in this high altitude.
The experiment resulted most satisfac
torily to ail concerned, for Jim demon
strated that his lungs were in magnificent
condition and mat he could late a tre
mendous amount of exercise without be
coming distressed.
He started off with a set-to with Billy
Woods. Now Billy hails from Denver,
where the altitude is a leading feature,
and in consequent he is quite used to do
ing fast woric in a rare atmosphere. No
better man than he could put Corbett to
the test of to-day. It was a red-hot bout
and lasted fully twenty minutes without
rest. Despite Woods' trained bellows, he
'vas soon blowing like a whale, whereas
Corbett seemed to be not in the least
fatieued. He good-naturedly joked Woods
about being lazy and getting old, and en
couraged him to return to the attack with
more vigor. Billy gave the San Francis
can all he had and then had to retire for a
spell of breathing.
Without even so much as stopping to
take a rest, Corbett seized hold of big
Jack McVey, the wrestler, and they began
to pull and haul each other around the
room unmercifully. McVey perspired and
puffed, and still Corbett continued fresh
ana strong. He finally released the giant
gladiator with the remark that "You
chaps had better cet in and harden up if
you want to trot in my class."
Although herculean efforts are being
made to bottle Oorbett ud for the ex
clusive enjoyment of his interview fora
San Francisco newspaper the champion
persisteutlv refuses to make a sphinx of
himself. When seen to-day he was found
to be the same open-hearted, genial fellovr
as of yore and as ready as ever to talk,
even though he diJ consent to sign a
statement for that same paper denying
that he had given out any signed inter
views to other papers and that he would
continue to be ever thus virtuous. But
nobody has bought the right to shut his
mouth, even it' they think th^y Lave.
James talked freely and willingly regard
ing his plans and the general outlook.
"I was somewhat disappointed, 1 ' he
said, "to find that my handball court
could not be finished to-day, for I bad
counted upon beginning my actual hard
training tnis afternoon, l'ou see the fieht
takes place just one month from to-day,
and I have all along figured upon begin
ning the last of my rough work on tne
17th of February, but I have been proni.sed
that the court will be in eood enough
shape by to-morrow afternoon to permit
my using it, and that means that I will
begin work then. 1 will go to the springs
after lu.ich to-morrow and remain there
until the day of the fight. The snow will
limit me mostly to indoor work for a time,
but I expect to see the roads dry before
long and that will p?rmit me to get out
for some long runs and tramps.
"I am delierhted with the springs. They
constitute an ideal training place for this
part of the country. I have not mapped
out my regular daily routine as yet, but it
will probably be about the same as my
former preparatory programmes. I am
already in eood condition and need only
to improve my wind ana get used to the
climate. I feel s-itisfied that the altitude
will have no bad effect upon me. I put in
some hard work to-day with Woods and
McVey, just to see wtiat the effect would
be, and 1 was not in the least distressed.
I am confident that I will go into the ring
fit to ti^ht for my life.
"There may be no harm iv adding what
I have said often before, and that is, that
I am going into that ring to whip Fitzsim
monb. I'll whip him as sure as there is a
sun in the heavenÃ."
Martin Julian speat most of hiÂ» time out
on the country roads to-day in search of a
suitable tra.ning-place for his brother-in
law, Fitzsimmons. He visited Steamboat
Springs, dvi did not like the place, and
declined to accept it. He inspected sev
eral other locations, but nothing BUited
him uniil he struck what is known as
Cook's ranch, a delightful place about two
miles south of Carson. This was just what
be wanted, and he lost little time in mak
ing a dicker for the use of it. Reasonable
terms being offered, he closed the bargain,
and now it is settled that Kitzsimmons
will train there. The big fighter was noti
fied of the selection by telegraph to-night,
and will start to-morrow for Carson. He
will get here Saturday morning and go di
rect to the ranch.
There is a comfortable twelve-room cot
tape on the place which will afford ampie
room for Fiizsimmnns and his family and
trainers. About 200 feet from the house is
quite a lame pavilion, which serves for
danoes during the summertime. This will
be fitted up as a gymnasium, and no bet
ter place could be found for the purpose.
The rancli is well stocked with cattle and
fowl, and there is everything there that
the Australian could desire. The roads
surrounding the place are level and in
good condition, so he will not be hampered
at all in his favorite style of conditioning
himself â long runs and twenty-mile
tramps.
Dan Stuart was closeted with the archi
tects again to-day trying to get out a set
of plans for the amphitheater he wants for
the big mill. Several contractors are here
in the hope of gettine the job. It is
understood that a decision will be reached
and the contract let to-morrow morning.
When Corbett was to-day fondling the
collie dog that is to be present as his mas
cot during the coming campaign, the dog
sunK his teeth in the 1 i i tie linger of Jim's
left hand. The champion spent the next
h'lteen minutes alternately sucking his
wounded finger and soakinc it in raw
whisky.

Mr. Flint Tells of the Elasticity
of the Syndicate He Rep

How Its Capital Stock Was Stretched
From $4,300,000 to $26,000,000
by Absorption*
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 17.â The
legislative committee investigating trusts
and monopolies in this State resumed its
session to-day. Charles F. Flint of the
United States Rubber Company again
took the stand. Before beginning Mr.
Flint's examination Mr. Lexow announced
that tne affairs of tue National Wall-
Paper Company would be taken up to
morrow.
Mr. Flint was asked if he had any
of the documents concerning the
organization of the United States
Rubber Company, and he produced the
certificate of organization of tt.e com
pany. Mr. Flint then gave the capital
ization of the various companies that
composed the United States Rubber Com
pany. The capital of the various com
panies absorbed was $4 30J,000, for which
$26,000,000 stock of the United States Rub
ber Company was issued. Mr. Flint said
he baa no personal knowledge as to
whether a proper price had been paid for
the properties for whicu. the $26,000,000
was issued.
Chairman Lexow became considerably
angered twice when Mr. Flint's answers
to his pointed questions were somewhat
evasive and he demanded "yes" or "no"
in sharp tones. Mr. Flint admitted that
he was interested in the Lycoruintr Rub
ber Company, but he could not tell what
he got for his interest. He admitted
that the United States Rubber Company
paid bankers a commission of 'l\ 2 per
cent, or $500,000, for selling the stocK of
the various companies.
"Was it paid in cash?"
"No, sir; in Block."'
'Will you produce data in regard to
that transaction after recess?"'
"I will endeavor to do so."
"Now, Mr. Flint, we don't want to be
too severe in regard to this matter, but we
think that this question of capitalization
is most important, and whether yenir com
pany is a New Jersey company or a New
York company, we mu?t have the.fnfor
mation we seek." said Senator Lexow.
"I will try to get it for you."
"Have you any knowledge of these
agreements of the trusts with theagents?"
asked Senator Lexow.
"I "want to say "
Chairman Lexow eot angry at this, and
rising in his scat waved the document in
front of the witness. "Have you any
knowledge of this agreement?' be
shouted.
"Not in detail," answared Mr. Flint,
who looked scarea.
"That's ali; let it co at that." And Mr.
Flint breathed easier.
Mr. Flint said he did not keep himself
posted as 10 the workings of the manufac
tories and did not know that the factories
had been closed down, restricting produc
tion and thus throwing many hands out
of employment, sometimes in the dead of
winter.
The witness was entirely lacking in in
formation when Questioned concerning
many details of the business. He was of
the opinion that the only way the price of
laoor could be maintained in this country
was by the centralization oi labor. By
means of this central- zation the American
wage-earner can compete against cheap
labor countries like Japan and China. He
also stated that his company had manu
factured more goods than was demanded.
"Is it not a fact that you have advanced
the price of rubber shoes from $1 90 to
$2 60 and that the price is now $2 55?"
"I don't know anything about that."
At this juncture a recess was taken,
Mr. Lexow excusing Mr. Flint until 10
a. M. to-jnorrow.
Alter recess the committee took up t c
soda syndicate, a combination recently
formed.
William J. \Valker was the first witness.
He said he was connected with the film of
Church & Dwight Company of Wall street
who produce bicarbonate of soda, sal soda
and saleratus. The business of the firm
bat been limited principally to the States
of New York and New Jersey, but busi
ness in the soda trad- lias been conducted
in every State in the Union. The com
pany had agreements with grocers.
"Can a jobber handling your goods and
not having an agreement compete with a
jobber handling your goods and having an
agreement?"
Witness replied that he did not believe
he could. He explained the purpose of the
agreement, as follows:
"The wholesale grocers came to us and
told ns they could not do business unless
they were protected as to price. They said
if we did not protect them they could do
no business. Tha wholesale business was
a nuisance to us and we did not wish to go
into it. That was in 1889."
The witness said there was no idea of
driving other goods out of competition
and (ieclared that his company by this
agreement had limited the sale of bicar
bonate to the two brands furnished by his
company. He admitted that there was
some competition in the sale of bicarbon
ate of soda, but refused to acknowledge
that his company had a monopoly in the
sale of that article in this State.
Charles G. Pope, the iunior member of
the firm of J. Monroe Baylor & Co., testi
fied tnat the factories' agreement in regard
to the sale of bicarbonate had affected
their business considerably. The witness
further said that but for the factories'
agreement bicarbonate of soda and other
kinds of soda would sell from 1 to \% cents
a pound less than at present.
An adjournment was here taken until
to-morrow.
MAJOR KcKINLEY IS BETTER.
Takes a Drive With His Wife in the Sun-
shine, but Cannot Receive His
Many Callers. .
CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 17.â Major Mc-
Rinley is considerably better this evening.
He took, upon the advice of his physician,
a short drive this afternoon, while the sun
was bright and the air warm. Mrs. Me-
Kinley, who has also been suffering with
hi grippe, accompanied him. It is not
likely that after his recovery he will see
any visitors save the few for whom he
sends.
Mr. Hanna returned to Cleveland this
afternoon. He came to make a friendly
call upon Major McKiniey and to ask
about his health. Mr. Hanna has recov
ered his own health and is in fine condi
tion again. The feeling in Ohio is that he
will be appointed to succeed Senator
Sherman.
General W. W. Deadley, who is a friend
of Major Mc&inley, called to-day to speak

for a moment with the President-elect and
Mr. Hanna about the matter of selecting
an escort to accompany Major McKinley
from the depot in Washington to his
hotel. There will probably be no military
escort.
Mrs. J. Ellen Foster was here to-day to
present an application for the appoint
ment of a friend. She had an interview
with Hon. Joseph P. Smith, but did not
see the President-elect. Major McKinley
will see no visitors this week.

Anoi/fr Report That Hanna Will Aot Be
Appointed.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 17.â There was
a conference between Governor Bushnell
and Charles L. Kurtz, chairman of the
Republican State Executive Committee,
in the Governor's office to-day, lasting
nearly all the afternoon. Though Gov
ernor Bushnell denied after the conference
that there were any new developments in
the Senatorial situation, the report comes
very direct that it was decided at this
conference not to appoint Chairman
Hanna to the vacancy, and that the Gov
ernor had t:ot really made up his mind as
to this until to-day. Kurtz now holds the
oihce of State Oil Inspector, which pays
about four times the salary of a United
Slates Senator. If Kurtz does not take
the appointment, it will probably be
given to Lieutenant-Governor Jones.
MANEUVERS OF BUNCE'S FLEET.
They Will Be Concluded at Charleston
With a Dinner and Brilliant
Ball.
CHARLESTON, S. C, Feb. 17.â 1t is
understood that the maneuvers of Ad
miral Bunce's fleet off Charleston are
hbout ever and the remaining two days
which the ships will remain in these
waters will be spent in feasting and pleas
ure. There will doubtless be a review in
the presence of Secretary Herbert when
he sails out to-morrow in the Dolphin.
which came into port this morning, but
the work for which the fleet came to
Charleston has been accomplished and the
fieet will break up Saturday. It is under
stood that the New York, Columbia, Mas
sachusetts, Indiana and Fern will pro
ceed direct to Hampton Roads for coal
and thence to New York, where they
will, arrive not later than March 2. The
Dolphin and Vesuvius will go to the Flor
ida coast looking for filibusters and the
Maine will proceed to New Orleans.
Should the Terror join tne fleet in the
meantime she will go to Norfolk with the
flagship. The Amphitrite will remain
here until Monday.
To-morrow Secretary Herbert, Attorney-
General Harmon, Admiral Gherardi and a
distinguished party of ladies and gentle
men will arrive in Ihe city. They will be
the guests of Charleston during their stay
here. Governor Ellerbe, all the chief
State officials and the members of both
houses of the General Assembly will also
be in the city for the occasion. A public
reception wili t8 held by Secretary
Herbert in the City Hall, and at night a
dinner will be given by tne Chamber of
Commerce. Speeches will be made by Sec
retary Herbert, Attorney-General Har
mon, Mayor Smyth and others.
Friday a military and naval ball will bÂ»
tendered the visitors by the city. And this
will probably conclude the blockade of the
port of Charleston. It is imtiossible just
now to estimate the result of the ma
neuvers Olllcers who will discuss the
matter express satisfaction with all that
basoccurreJ. Tliis consisted mainly in
ex reining with the searchlights and guns
of the ship?.
Nightly there was practicing with the
lights on ships' boats sent out for the spe
cial purpose. The ship would pick the
boat up, and then following it with the
light a record would be made of the ob
servations taken at all distances until the
limit of the light was reached. The prac
ticing with the main batteries was espe
cially important and interesting. With
the smaller guns considerable accuracy
was developed, some of the ships striking
their floating targets frequently. The
work with the heavy pieces was less ac
curate, but far more instructive, as the
men needed this practice the most. The
New York, for instance, struck her target
no less than twenty times during the
practice with both of her batteries. While
the ofheers do not say so, it is probable
that the work with the searchlights was
somewhat disappointing at times. On
clear nights the lights achieved powerful
results, but they proved utterly inade
quate to cope with the heavy fog or mist.
On the night when the Vesuvius ran the
blockade the lights did not carry 600
yards.
The Maine will leave the fleet to-mor
row end proceed to Port Royal, where she
will coal. It is stated positively by per
sons in a position to know of what they
speak that the ships stand the firing of
the great gans well, neither the guns,
turrets nor gear sustaining any injury.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 17.-Secre
tary Herbert left Washington for Charles
ton this afternoon. Attorney-Geueral
Harmon and Captain Wi:itz of the
British navy followed to-night. The party
goes to witness the naval maneuvers now
going on in Charleston harbor. Secretary
Herbert took with him a handsome gold
medal to be presented to Seaman Creel
man of the battle-ship Maine, who spr.ine
from that vessel when men were washed
overboard in the violent storm on that
vessel's cruise to Charleston.

SENATORS DEBATE
ON IMMIGRATION
Conference Report Finally
Adopted by a Vote of
34 to 31.
The Measure Has Already
Passed the House and Now
Gees to Cleveland.
Puts Up the Bars Against I literate
Aliens and Wings the "Birds
of Passage."
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 17.â 1n the
Senate to-day a joint resolution was re
ported by Sherman (R.) of Ohio from the
Committee on Foreign Relations, per
mitting the Secretary ot War to detail an
army officer not above the rank of captain
for the position of instructor in the mili
tary 6chool of the Greater Republic of
Central America, and it was passed.
Another resolution was offered by Petti
grew (Sil.) of South Dakota, and it was
agreed to, calling on the Secretary of
State for a copy of Sir Julian I'auncefote's
reply to Secretary GresUam's letter calling
the attention of tne British Government
to the utter failure of the regulations of
the Paris tribunal to protect the seal herds
of Alaska, and requesting an explanation
of the same.
Another resolution was introduced by
Vest (D.)of Missouri, calling on the Secre
tary of the Interior for information as to
the proposed erection of a steel elevator in
Yellowstone Canyon, Yellowstone Park,
and requesting him to withhold action
thereon until the propriety of the matter
can be determined by Congress. It was
adopted.
A resolution heretofore offered by Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska, inquiring of the Civil
Service Commission in relation to the un
usual discharge of certain employes in the
Bureau of Animal Industry in South
Omaha, was taken ud and discussed by
Allen. He related his unavailing efforts
to get information on the subject, and
spoke of the treatment which he had re
ceived from the Civil Service Commission
as a "violation of all the decencies and
proprieties of official life." The only ex
cuse given for the discharge of two em
ployes was that they had a picture{of Mr.
Bryan in their windows, while six other
employes in tho bureau had pictures of
Mr. McKinley in their windows, but were
not even reprimanded. Two other of the
discharged employes had been the victims
of the civil service law because they were
supporters of Mr. Bryan. He denounced
the civil service law as a fraud, a snare
and a delusion. The resolution was
agreed to. It directs the Civil Service
Commission to report all the facts and cir
cumstances to the Senate.
The conference report on the immigra
tion bill was laid before the Senate, and was
brieily explained by Lodge (R.) of Massa
chusetts, in chnrge of the bill.
Palmer (D.) of Illinois denounced the
bill ;i.-> an outgrowth of nativitism, a doc
trine for which he ? aid he bad the most
profound and earnest esteem. As to the
exclusion of occasional laborers, which
was aimed at Canadians crossing the
bordentunng tbesummer months, Palmer
said that it other nation? followed that
"miserable, narrow example," and made
retaliatory legislation American laborers
in Mexican and Canadian mines' and
forests would suffer, legislation, he
declared to be "an outrage on the comity
of nations and on the civilization of the
age."
In the course of his speech allusion was
made by Palmer to the State of Massa
chusetts as the only Northern State which
refused suffrage to men who could not
read or write.
The defense of his State's constitutional
provision in that regard was taken up by
Hoar (II. ) of Massachusetts, who spoke ot
such statement as "pure demagoguery."
Hoar was reminded that during the war
Massachusetts had rent emissaries to the
South and filled ncr quota of troops with
colored men who could not read or write.
Carter (R.) of Montana gave notice that
if the conference report was agreed to he
would move for another conlerence, with
instructions to the Senate conferees to
Insist upon an amendment that shall
apply to the citizens of any country on
tnis sphere. He regarded it as an im
mature and unwise piece of legislation.
Caffery (D.) of Louisiana also oppos d
the conference report and bad read
''Ouida's" letter Â»n praise of the illiterate
Italian peasantry as contrasted with the
trasn of cities â emasculated, corrupt and
debauched.
Chandler (K.) of New Hampshire did
not let the opportunity pass of remind
ing Caffery that in no State of the Union
were Italians treated so badly as in
Louisiana.
Cafftry said that such "tilings" had no
effect on him. The people ot Louisiana
had no sort ot apology for the murder of
the Italians alluded to by the Senator
from New Hampshire.
Chandler disclaimed any purpose to in
dulge in a "fling 1 ' at the people of Louisi
ana. He only hoped that after reading
"Ouida's" letter they would not kill any
more Italians.
Gray (D. ) of Delaware also opposed the
conference report and the bill as a de
parture from the settled policy of the
United States.
Gibson (D.)of Maryland made an argu
ment against the conference report and
against the bill, which, he declared, was
framed on the theory ol the fugitive slave
law, and. like that law, its inhumanity
wouid shock the moral sense of the
people.
Bianchard (D. ) of Louisiana also
spoke aeainst ttie conference report. He
was rather in favor of encouraging immi
gration to build up the waste places in the
public domain. Perhaps not 5 per cent of
the public domain was in actual cultiva
tion. No such drastic measure should be
enacted into law.
Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts closed the
debate with a speech in favor of the re
port. As.to the effect of the bill on Amer
ican miners La British Columbia lie did
not know how great their number was.
They would not be afff cted except by re
taliatory lecislation. He di I not know
there was going to be retaliatory legisla
lation, and he did not see how Congress
could legislate on that basis. There was.
a great mass of unemployed people in the
United States. When they were all em
ployed then Congress might consider
whether it was wise to cease restricting
immigration.
At 5 p. m. the debate was closed and a
vote was taken on the conference report.
It was agreed toâ ayes 34, noes 81â as fol

Dttertnination to Limit the Petition* of
-! ~" Officers' Widow*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 17.â 8y
the very decisive vote of 93 to 28 the
House to-day confirmed its intention to
abide by the policy of limiting pensions
for widows of general officers to $50 a
month and grading from that sum down
for widows of officers of low rank.
The question aroso over the report of
the conferees on the bill to pension the
widow of Captain J. Scott Payne of the
Fifth United States Cavalry. It was a
Senate biil and the amount of pension
was originally fixed at $50 a month. The
House reduced it 10 $30, but in conference
the House managers yielded to the Sena
tors and recommended that the House
recede from its amendment. This the
House refused to do, after an hour's de
bale, in which the matter was fully dis
cussed, and disposed of by the vote stated
and the bill was returned to the con
frlMOD-
The conference report on the legislative
executive and judicial appropriation biU
presented by Mr. Bingbam was agreed to.
Tiie principal changes made were in the
provisions for the Congressional Library.
As agreed upon the bill authorizes the
President to appoint a librarian and su
perintendent, who miwt be confirmed by
the Senate, shall receive $50U0 a year and
appoint the subordinates in their" respect
ive departmentsâ 187 all told. T' c bill
carries a totai appropriation of $21,715,767.
The bill enacting that all reservoir sitef,
reserved or to be reserved, shall be open
to use and occupation under the right of
way act of March 3, 1891, which was made
the special order for to-morrow, was de
bated two hours and passed. Amend
ments were agreed to giving the State con
trol of the rates and regulations for the
use of the water coming from the reser
voirs.
The House entered upon the considera
tion of the contested election case of
Hopkins vs. Kendall from the Tenth Ken
tucky District, based upon the use 01 an
illegal and fraudulent ballot in Clark
County. Without the vote of that county
Hopkins (R. ) would be elected, ana the
minority recommended that it be thrown
out and the contestant seated.
The majority of the committee, while
condemning the action of the clerk of the
county, who prepared the ballot, do not
believe that the vote should be rejected,
and recommend that Kendall retain his
seat.
Judee Daniels (It.) of New York ad
dressed the House in support of the com
mittee report, and the House at 2:15 p. m.
adjourned.

CUBAN WARRIORS
ROUT REGULARS
Crushing Defeat of the
Spaniards by Gomez's
Forces.
Although Badly Frightened
Weyler Published a Report
of Victory.
Gallant and Telling Hand- to- Hand
Conflict With the Deadly
Machetes.
NEW YORK, N. Y.,Feb. 17â The Sun's
Havana correspondent, writing under date
of Februarys, says:
Trusted Cuban news has been received,
giving further details of the battle at Juan
Crioilo, in Las Villas, reported Jast Friday
by cable. The tirst Spanish account of
the battle claimed a victory, as usual, but
with a painful paucity of details.
The second report, whicn was com
municated by the pres3 censor to the
American correspondents here, read that
Colonel Arajanoa made a brilliant com
bined bayonet charge and cavalry attack
upon the insurgents, dislodging them
from their positions after two hours of
hand-to-I:and fighting. In neither of
these reports was the name of General
Gomez mentioned, nor did his name ap
pear in La Lucua and the Diaro de la
Mariana ia the accounts of the battle
which the press censor permitted them to
print.
All the information proves that the
action at Juan Criolio adds another page
of glory to the history of Gomez's military
career. The battle decided the campaign
in Las Villati in favor of the Cubans and
frightened Weylor so far that he, as
already Known, telegraphed to Havana
for re-enforcements, declaring himself un
able to withstand General Gomez unless
he had more troops under his command.
The battle was fought on February 1,
'and lasted from about 3 to 6 o'clock in the
afternoon. It began after General Gomez
had raised the siege ot Arroyo Blanco on
the arrival of the column of Colonel
Arjanes from Cieno de Villa in aid of the
besieged garrison of Arroyo Blanco. When
the first shots of Arjanes' vanguard were
heard a few minutes after 2 o'clock Gen
eral Gomez ordered bis troops to abanlon
the &ieee ana concentrate on the estate of
Juan Criollo, between two hills and with
several prominent positions dominating
on the plain in which Arroyo Blanco is
located.
Gomez took possession of those strategic
point*. Arjanes was in command of 3500
men, to which he added (500 more path
ered from Cieno de Villa. There were two
cannon, one 01 thirteen and the other of
six pounds. G^roez had only L'soo well
armed men. Gr>mez had aiso a pneu
matic dynamite gun, but it was not very
effective. However, two 01 three bombs
exploded at Juan Criollo in the Spanish
ranks when the fighting began produced
terrible confusion. With the aid of Gen
eral Carrillo, General Gomez succeeded in
driving the Spaniards to the center of tbe
estate of Juan Crjollo, where a terrible
fight began.
At last the Spaniard?, having been chas
tised by the combined tire of Carrillo on
one side and Gomez on the other, became
panic-stricten, and the Cubans had before
mem merely a mob of men. Just at this
juncture the Spanish nipjor, Posada, fell
dead, his chest pierced by a bullet.
The confusion of the Spaniards now be
came greater than ever, for Posada was
strucK down nearly in the center of their
forces. The Spanish surgeon, Dr. Cenicero,
went to assist Posada, but when he lifted
him from the ground to see his wound,
another volley of the Cubans killed him
also.
The ord6r "To the machete," given by
General Gomez, decided the'action. The
Cubans charged from all sides, and a
hand-to-hand fight began. In the first
moments the Cuban colonel, Remetio Lo
pez was killed ny a bavnnet ihrust. The
S anish lieutenants, D>n Martinez and
Don Federico Pena, fell rtead, Martinez
from a blow by a machete which cut his
head off. Eig.-ty Spanish soldiers were
killed with the machetes and more than
100 were severely wounded and left on tue
held. Before the hand-tc-hand tight be
gan the Spanish losses were already more
than 100 men.

and doctors' prescriptions availed not.
About this time Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla was recommended. The tirst bot-
tle was used and the only change for the
better was the regularity of the bowels and
the bright clearness of the eyes. After the
second bottle Edna began to get well.
She not only became strong and hearty,
but all the facial blemishes disappeared,
and is now the beautiful young lady you
see before you.
This story is not colored just to boom
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. The above
story is about the mildest way of telling
the actual facts concerning the blood
remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Doctors have often been puzzled and "give
it up" â about Joy's. It is a peculiar herb
remedy. It contains no mineral poisons.
It is made entirely of heros. The only
people who speak against the remedy are
the druggists who have "A BETTER
PROFIT" sarsaoarilla. When you want a
good blood medicine that produces no
pimples take Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
every step from the persisteir. fighting of
the Cubans, the Spaniards retreated to
the town, reaching it after 6 o'clock. One
section of the column did not reach tlie
town because it was dispersed in the plain
when Lieutenant Pena was killed. Alfi
reports agree that Colonel Ar janes behaved
bravely. The terrible slaughter of his
men was due to his incapacity aad the
superiority of Gomez as a strategist lather
than to lack of courage on his part. But
after hi 3 defeat \v:is so decisive the Span
iards prefer to preserve silence over the
affairs raiher than praise and prouote
him, as they have repeatedly done in the
case of less courageous chiefs.
The Cuban losses at J uan Crioilo are in
signiticant as compared witn those of the
Spaniards. Colonel Lopez and Lieuten
ant John Diaz were tilled and about
seventy soldiers also pnrished.

HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 17,â General Wey
ler to-day received the provincial authori
ties of Sancti Spiritus. He said that the
revolution in Cuba from its very begin
ning had taken the character of a brigand
war and that the insurgents had, when
ever possible, avoided engagements with
the Spanish forces. He prophesied the
early ending of the revolution and de
clared that the pacification of the island
would soon be an accomplished fact. Gen
eral Weyler remains in the Sancti Spiritua
district.
A hot fight is reported to have occurred
between a band of rebels nnd a Spanish
force in the Tigre Hills in Las Villas, re

gents and the capture of the positions oc
cupied by them. The Spaniards lost nine
killed and thirty-one wounded.

State Electro Medical Instituteâ Dear Doctors:
Wh"n I commenced your Klectrn-Medjcal treat-
ment I was an invalid from rheumatism. Ab ut
eieht years ago I was attacked with inflammatory
rheumatism, which after a. time changed to sciat-
ica. A number of the be* physicians of >-a i
Francisco treated me and pronounced my case in-
curable. Nothing gave me permanent relief until
X tried your Kleciro-mediotl treatment. I hail
tried electricity alone, aud as for taking medicines
alone, I had exhausted the catalogue or medicine*.
Your giving of medicines in conjunction with elec-
tricityâ the comDlned treatment is what cured me.
No one who has known me doubt* i;. livery ele-
ment of mv being gives demonstration of the gen-
uineness of the cure. Yours respectfully,

FOR THE PRINTER
Dibble's Bills Providing
Seventy-Five Thousand
Dollars Passed.
Some of the Assembly Minority
Eat Crow by Voting for the
Measures.
Considerable Filibustering Fails to
Defeat the Second R;
lief Bill.
SACRAMENTO. Gal., Feb. 17.-Camf
netti was the first to eat his dish of State
printine crow, find he did it to-day with a
comic grimace as he voted "aye" on Dib
ble's bill 863 appropriating $40,000 for the
relief of the Sate Printer. Power of San
Francisco and Landsborongh of Sacra
mento also broke away from the filibusters
and voted for the bill. Cut on No. 864,
also by Dibble, appropriating ?3T> 000 for
the support of tb? office for the remainder
of the fiscal year, they voted no with the
rest of the minority, thus putting them
selves in a position of refusing to support
measures which they themselves had
offered or attempted to offer on the day
before.
Caminetti'a action in voting for the
$40,000 appropriation and refusing to vote
for the .$35,000 appropriation is looked
upon by the knowing ones as an indica
tion that Governor Eudd may sign the
one and veto the other.
The t>iliÂ«< before the House this after
noon were Dihble's 863 and B6i and Shana
han's 865. No. SG3 appropriates $40,00).
and s entitled "An act for the relief of
the State Printing Office, and makinc an
appropriation to pay the deficiency for
the current fiscal year that may be found
to exist in the appropriation for the --up
port of said printing office for the said
year at the date of the approval of this
act." No. 364 is entitled "An act making
an appropriation for the support of the
State Punting Office For the remainder of
the forty-eighth fiscal year." Shanahan's
SGS appropriate? $40,000. and is entitled
"An act making an appropriation for leg
islative printing for the thirty-second
session of the Legislature."
Siianahan, in speaking on his bill, said
that the State Printer had spent money
without any authority of law, and that
th Dibble bills expressly validated the
violation of the law by the State Printer.
"I don't say," he added, "that State
Printer Johnston is dishonest, but rather
that he is mistaken as to the law."
Dibble was quick to set Shanahan right.
He said that Shanahan's assertion that
the bill was intended to cover up any de
linquency in the State Printing Office or
to validate any act of the State Printer
was entirely unwarranted by the fact?.
The purpose of the bill was to appropriate
money to pay the waces of employes, who
had not received a dollar from the Sate
for several weeks. The object of the bill
prepared by the gentleman from Sbnsta
was to confine the appropriation to the
payment of bills incurred for printing
legislative matter only. Since the open
ing of the present session of the Legisla
ture a large amount of public printing
other than legislative, such as reports of
State officers, etc., had been done, and the
printers had not been paid for that work,
nor had the material used in it been paid
for. The object of the Dibble bill was to
provide for the derjciency which had been
created. The peculiar wording was in
tended to overcome the law passed by the
last Legislature. When the appropria
tion was introduced en January 12 there
was no deficiency in the printing office,
that having been created since that time,
yo that in reality the deficiency has been
incurred in technical violation of the law
of 1^895.
X . 863 had been prepared to meet the
deficiency incurred by a technical viola
tion of the statute. It proposed a relief
for the State Printing Office, which it was
in the power of the Legislature to give.
It should hi remembered also, urged
Dibble, that all this money must be dis
bursed under the direction of the State
Boar iof Examiners. It was the only way
In which the exigency could be met. If
Bnannhan'and the Democrats associated
with him desired to refuse payment to the
employes of the State Printin â¢ Office he
and the-.- should insist on his bill. There
was no other way of paying those people
except by a r*liÂ«i bill.
As Fo'oii a- Dibble had finished Cutter of
Yn.ba introduced a substitute to thÂ« effect
that Assembly bills 863, 804 and BGS pre
sented a case of urgency and therefore
should be read the second and third time
and placed upon final pas-age.
The House went into committee of the
whole and the li ii.ustering of the minor
ity was proceeded with. Shanahan pro
posed an amendment to No. 863 which
would destroy it by making it unconsti
tutional, and Cnminetti made a mysteri
ous speech to tha effect that there was
more behind the contest than the State
Printing Office matter.
Th- speech of the day was made by
"Old Ma;:' DrydenofSan Diego, a fnsion
iÂ«t and advocate of some new system of
distribution which apparently does not
include the distribution of wages to em
p.. yes of the State Printing Office. His
speech was cunningly phrased and was
meant as a cloak to hide, the real partisan
motives which impelled him to vote with
the Democrats against the printing em
ployes. He bean by saying that he stood
between the contending parties "that
seemed to b' tryin to make olitical cap
ital out of the affair." It was apparent
afterward to his hearers that no matter
where he stood he voted early and often
for the Democratic programme.
The battle raged for several hours, the
minority filibustering by offering substi
tutes and by resorting to the time-worn
. devices usual on such occasions until the
previous question was called and the bills
placed upon final passage.
When the roll was called on 863â the
$40,000 appropriationâ Caminetti did not
answer to his. name. Landsborough led
the bolt from the uiinoriiy by voting aye,
and he explained that the bill would re
lieve th? distress which existed among
the printers in the Slate office.
Power of San Francisco followed. "It
is time to settle this thing," he said. "A
preat many people have been working in
the State office for three or four weeks and
ca/i't get their money. Therefore I vote
for the bill."
< aminetti rose at the conclusion of the
rollcail and -ad: "Mr. Speaker, I vote
oye." Then he looked cunning. He did
not pro} ose that the federated trades
should jump on his neck for bill 863. But
he and the remainder of the minority
voted against No. 864â the $35,000 appro
priation. Both bills were finally passed
by 4 > ayes to 28 noes.
Shanahan's No. 865 was defeated. The
bills were ordered transmitted to the
Senate, and Caminetli and Shanahan
pave notice that to-morrow they would
move a reconsideration. '
The bills were taken up in the Senate in
the evening and were passed there.
North's Assembly concurrent resolution 6,
appointive Senators Dickinson, Gillette
and Seawell and As-seuibiyinen Price,
Dennery and Caminetii as a joint com
mittee ;o investicate ihe affairs of the
State Printing Office was also passed by
the Assembly and transmitted to the
Senate.
It provides that the committee shall
employ two experts on printing, one to be
appointed by the majority of the commit
tee, and one by t; c minority of the com
mittee, and '.wo accountants to be ap
pointed in a similar way. The Senate
amended the resolution and provided that
the experts and accountants should be ap
pointed by the majority of the committee
only.
Mead's amendment calling for an in
vestigation by the State Board of Exam
iners was voted down.
At the night session of the Assembly
S'-ate Printer JoLnston sent â  statement
to the House which was received- and or
dered printed in tv-morrow's journal.
The following are extracts:
Many charges of a wild and fantastic nature
have been made against me and the Institu
tion under ray charge, and I have hitherto re
frained irora answering them, b.'causo to
those who were famiiiar with the oflice tlie
charges were so ridiculous tbalau answer
seemed unnecessary ; but inasmuch as a con
certed attack seems to be made by certain
persons to misrepresent the facts, ] have been
advised by my ir:--r,ds that it is due to myself
that I shall make a statement concerning
these matters:
In the first place, with the exception of my
salary and possibly a few dollars that I may
receive for contingent expenses, I do not
| handle and under the law coud not handle
j one dollar of the State's money. Every claim
charged against the appropriation for support
of the State Printing Office inusi, before 11 Is
paid, receive the sanction of the State Hoard
of Examiners, consisting of the Governor, a
Democrat, ami of the Secretary of state and
Attorney-General, Republicans. It then
pusses to t be Controller of toe State, who. if
j he is satisfied with the claim, draws a war-
I rant therefor, aid it Is paid out of the State
; treasure to he person who presents the claim.
I Every claim that bas been paid during my
administration of this office has been paid in
this manner, and every cleirn has received the
sanction of the Board of Examiner!". It would
I be absolutely impossible (or mo, even if I so
j desired, to use for my own purpose one dollar
' ot the State's money.
A charge has been made that names cf per
j sons who do not exist have been carried on
I the payroll. These charges, if true, would
I simp. y condemn toe Governor, Secretary of
State and Attorney-General, who pass upon
the claims, and the Controller, who delivers
j the warrants. This statement, 1 say mrst
' emphatically, is untrue, and nobody" could
, draw any money in this way without com-
I mitting a forgery. It is the practice for most
of the State institutions for the person in
cnarge to draw one warrant, and to give his
check to the individuals entitled to the re
spective amounts. Under the law I cannot
follow i ii is practice and have not followed it;
but every person, no matter how small his
claim may be, woo has a claim against the
State payable out of tha appropriation for the
State Printing Oflice receives & warrant there
for.
It has been charped that there is a discrep
-1 ancy betveen the Controller's books and mine.
I This is absolutely untrue, mid in Ihe very
I nature of things could not be true. The Con
troller is tne bookkeeper of the State and his
are the books to be governed by. In estimat
ing the Amount jo consumed I have made a
I rough estimate, taking into consideration the
composition, stock, presswork and binding,
; but I have not counted as ii charge against
j the institutions or departments other ex
penses consisting of light, heating, power, re
pairs and sundry other expenses which are
chargeable to this Institution as a whole. The
laws ot the State are faulty In that they do
I not require that each department and officer
i should pay nut of the appropriation made for
it or him the amount of printing done for him
; or his department, but over this I have no
control. lam satisfied that if the institutions
of the State were required to pay for printing
j out of their appropriation the "demand upon
I me would be much, less thrn i; hss been.
In the management of this office ] have fol
[ lowed union rules nnd employed union men
I and paid the union rate of wages. I urn free
to confess that if the State desires to inaugu
! rate a policy of having work done for less than
! union rates, and not in accordance with union
rules, a slight saving might be effected, nt
i this is for your body to determine. So tar as 1
' Â«m concerned I desire to say that until trie
; law is changed, and aÂ« long as the matter is
left to my discretion. I shall run it as a union
I Printing Office, as I am a union printer m v
! self.
Ever since the inauguration of the State
j printing office there has been a concerted
,' attack made by persona and establishments
. who desire to have the work done by contract.
There have also been frequent attempts made
j to prevent the Stare from publishing State
textbooks. Tnese are matters of legislative
policy for the Legislature to determine. I have
: already asked, as ron know, that a joint com
â  mittee from both houses be appointed to mi
i vestigate the State I'rintlng Office, when these
â  matters can be verified and elaborated in
! detail.
For your information 1 append to this letter
a statement from the Controller of the State,
showing that every dollar that has been px
pended by the State Printing Office has l>een
upon claims audited and fallowed by the State
Board of hxnuiiners and pai<l upon trie Con
trnl-r's warrants. In many if not in most of
the bate institutions, there is h contingent
fund which is . xpended by them without
beiiig r p B s sed upon by tlie Board of Examiners
or by the Controller. This i< not the case
with the State Printing Office. The State
Piintinp Office collects no money of luown
ar.d handles no money, and it :s absolutely
impi.ssiVj.e ior any discrepancy to exst unless
:t be by collusion with the Konrd of Exami
ners, State Contreller a:;d state Treasurer.
Appended to the communication of the
State Printer is a statement by the Con
troller certifying that al! money expended
for the Stnte Printing Office bos been paid
upon claims presented to and allowed by
the State Board of Examiners and paid
upon warrants isÂ«ued Iron the ollice and
paid by the State Treasurer :
I further certify that the State Printer col
! lects no money himself, and that it is impossi
; ble for nny money, to be spent except upon
claims allowed by the Hoard of Examiners
and by the Controller. I further certify that
the State Printer draws no money nimself ex
! cept his salary and small items for postage and
traveling expenses, and that ail warrants are
â  ISMic-d to the pariv directly who performed
j the services or tarnished the â applies, and
| that warrants ore delivered by me io such t>er-
I tons only or their authorized ticen'. I further
â â  certify that there are vouchers on file lor every
! claim that has been allowed against the ap
; propriation for the support of the state Print
ing Office, and that my books correctly show
the amount of money that has been allowed
and expended for that purpose, a,ud that there
I is not and cannot be any discrepancy between
i my accounts and the accounts of the State
I Printer authorized by law to be kept.

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. 15.â A large
part of to-night's session was consumed
in a spirited debate on Senator Doty's
bill 57, entitled "An act to regulate and
govern theot^rations of the rock-crushing
plant at the State prison at Folsom, to
provide for the sale of crushed rock and
the disposition of Ihe revenues derived
herefrom."
Anderson's amendment to raise the
price of the crushed rock from 30 cents to
IV) cents per ton biought Eunis and S:ms
of Sacramento and Cutter of Yubri into the
thick of the fray. They argued that the
convict labor on the rock-crusher did not
interfere with free lahor. Snail said that
the Folsom reck could not be used in Fan
Francisco in com petition with other rock
because of the hi gh rate of freight, where
upon Mahoney inquired how the State
highway* coufd be built wnh that rock
for the production of which the whole
State was being taxed.
Treacy oi i~;m Francisco made a violent
attack on the bill. Bridgford asked Trency
whether he was not afr.iid that the prison
made rock would interfere with his
(Treacy's) business as â  contractor.
Treacy replied: "No, sir. I employ
fifty men, and I pay them $.' per day,
when some counties pay only $1 50 per
day." * .
"Has any of this rock been used in Sau
Francisco?" asked Clarke.
"No, air."
"Then what are you kicking against?"
demanded Clarke.
Treacy made prompt reply: "I am

immigration to this State, the State Board

W. H. Mills, N. P. Chipman, Joseph tr.

!-AS I'BAM I'll), <â¢Â£â )>. 15. 1H97
Hon. Jamcx Jf. Jhidd, Governor of California,
Sacramento, Cat.â l>kak Mb; Your Excellency is
no doubt aware of the lact that in September last
a reDort of the consul-Ueneral residing in .'-an
Francisco and representing Great Britain in the
consular service of that country was transmitted
to Parliament In general eft\ct that report de
clared that for tho most part the colonization
schemes projected in this State were fraudulent
Â»nd deceptive. The [sovereign of Great Britain in
dorstd these statements sufllcieuLly to cause the
docum-n". to I â <â¢ transmitted to the British Parlia
ment, and the representations therein made have
Lecome la a sense thÂ« otUcial expression of that
Unfortunately for our State, the strictures con
tained In the document have for the moit part a
degree of jus itlcation in the facts of the case.
1 ht-re are now offered on the market- colony
lan la In which do intelligent Calltornlan wouid In
vest. They are addressed to foreign Ignorance
and designed only lor the attention aud p tronu^e
of those whose leek of Information makes them
easy victims' of dishonest immigration schemes.
It is no part of the present purpose . n addressing
you o present or expose these schemes. We,
therefore, co:. tent ourselves by the declaration of
facts, for the verification of which we have ample
evidence. The situation herein outlined calls for
remedial measures.
In the lir<L instance the representation made by
the i onsllHieneral of Great Jiritaln and its otlirlal
liH J .orii-iumt by the sovereign of that country ;s v
condemnation which, while intended only tor the
condemnation of fraudulent schemes, will neces
sarily be extended in its effect to the most bene
ficent and advantageous enterprises.
Cttiilornla, notwithstanding it.- age, is a country
of large extent occupied by a relatively small popu
lation. Our condition is such a< to make â  re
enforcemant of our capital and population moat
desirable. We have natural resources whicn,
when developed, will prove a rich reward to en
terprise and Intelligently directed capital. Hut our
representations concerning these resources and
our presentation of the in luce'i ents they Offer is
now very broadly discreuiied throughout the
world.
It these representations were wholly false, If
they had no louiuatii n In Ji.ct, the case w v d be
different; but un ortunately the evidence that
ojHiiy fraudulent bchenies have been projected
and have resul i.l ulan-trously to those who were
deceived by them give* not only color bnt
demonstration of fraud which, as already md
ca'.ed. will attach to all representations which way
be made on behalf of our commonwealth.
This situation demands remedies. '1 he first of
th'Sels to establish some instrumentality of an
otlicial chara ter which will ei|.o*e i nd denounce
the projectors of fraudulent and deceptive coloni
zation undertakings. In the next instance, the
or iltiary unofficial methods of t.e defense of the
stale against the broader Inferences of ihe charges
already made and In part substantiated Hre lu
tofficleut to the accomplishment of the purpose.
in times past the price oi land In California has
been high. The richest fruit lands In the state
have been held at prices which no use to which
they mignt be devoted would justify. The general
farming lands of ihe .-late were held nt prices
which forbade all expectation, of a reasonable return
upon me capital invested.
These â¢â â  ndltions have panged away. California
in the past has presented an example wherein the
price of uÂ«r.al <*sia c was not correlated with the
drnslty of population. in all countries there has
been a fixed relation Of value between the soil,
the original source of ail wealth, an l the density
of population occupying the country embrac.ns
hat soil.
â¢ al forma for a long time appeared to be an ex
ce; tion to this rule: but it Is no longer so. Very
high prices fcr ti e farming and fruit lands of Cali
fornia are no longer obtainable, nor even aslccu.
The depressed state of business throughout the
world has wrought its perfect work in Calliorma
In the direction of ellm.uatliig fa sÂ« factors in ail
valuation.-. The average value of all classes of
agricultural land In California is not to-day 30 per
ceuiof that placed upon it during the decade be
tueen 1880 and 1890.
Men forego lii me ties, brealc up home relations,
sever themselves from kindred and from friends
only because they telleve they can better their
conditionâ tinancia'ly. morally and socially. The
sober question which confronts us in Inviting a
re-enforcement of our population is: Do Hie con
ditions ot California, In .he financial, educational,
religious, moral and social aspects. cfrer superior
inducements to those existing in the more densely
settled portions of oar country? ii they do not

become citizens of our commonwealth is In Us
nature a deception.
We who address you in this communication and
the organization we represent believe thai Cali
fornia offers inducements superior to those of
many u.oie liens ly settled countries, ana enter
taining (htt opinion we also entertain the belief
that In inviting immigration to California we Â»re
conferring a favor cot only upon this common
wealth but up. m those who accept that Invitation.
Never before ihe pre ent time In the history of
this sute have the indncemeots to immigration
been so great.
Jleudl-pose of th* property they have accum
ulated and make Investments In new countries In
the hope of inquiring the ownership of pioperty in
thÂ» new location in advance of its developed va ue
They expe t, as they have a right, Hint the incje
ment i.l value on the property they purchase will
r -enforce- cuttr own indust y and economy In ac
quiring wealth. For man/ years past tin, hope or
expectation could not be realized with fence to
forniu. Ihe Inflate I price* at which the lands
of the Mate were be d forbade this ex pec; vi ion.
A II this Is changed. Lands are i.o lunger held at
values which anticipate development, and out of
this grows the opportunity of reaping the reward
or that enhancement which will necetgarlly ensue
upon the more dense settlement of our Mate, All
the condlti< Inciting Immigration to tali Slate
have improved. The rate of transportation ha* a
steadily downward tendency. The. cost if living
constantly declines. The orUlnai cost of planting
.ii i riliiird has been vry greatly diminished A
rite expertlfiic c as to the science of horticulture
and agriculture affords guaranteo against the
costly mistakes of ignorance. -
In <-v -ry aspect of the case the Invitation which
11. people of California can now extend to the
home-seekor* of the wurld has belter justification
than at any time in tne history of the cumtno.i
weaith. At this juncture the reputation of ojr
State as a desiruule p:ncÂ«* for residence has re
ceived the hroadrsi injury.
Tn-8e matters are oi the highest importance to
the State of California. They are of vastly greater
Importance than the question of exnlhinii^ the
products of the >tate at i astern or foreign expo
â¢llions. We are confronted b. a condition which
will deny to us our due share of the immigration
wnlcn seeks new homes each year.

SACRAMENTO, Cku, Feb. 17.â A1l who
find it necessary to regularly or occasional
ly visit their "uncle" will be interested in

Holloway and passed by the Senate to

The measure is designed in the interest

Among otiier tilings the bill is intended

posable funds, which cannot be loaned readily
upon eoods and chattels or upon sate securi
ties, such corporation may make loans of such
tundl upon mortgages of real estate and may

bonds or other securities as the directors

An Important Sul'Jrct Upon Which Sen
ator* Do >ot Agree.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 17.â Dairy
inspection and incident thereto the extir
pation of cattle infected with bovine
tuberculosis, was the subject ol quite a
lively discussion in the Senate to-day.
Senate bill 182 by Dickinson was up for
third reading.
Dickinson at once took the wind out of
the sails of the strvncest opponents to the
measure by offering an amendment strifc
iii;.' out the clause providing for compen
sation to owners for cattle condemned
and slaughtered by authority of the in
spectors. He also asked lenve to amend
by cutting: the $45,000 in half.
l'raunhart, who sees an opportunity for
opposition oratory in f-verything that
emanates from a Republican, whether in
or.ler or not, took tne Hoor and spoke
against the measure as a whole. With his
t^uixot-like imaeination he saw danger
in the provision fixing the compensation
of veterinary surgeons and inspectors at
$5 a day for each day actually employed,
llis active but faulty mental vision saw
each county burdened with $10 a day,
though there is no requirement which
makes this possible. Both the number
of veterinaries and the number of inspec
lorsisiefito the discretion of the State
Dairy Bureau.
He was aJso opposed to the provision
that the wort of dairy inspection should
be left to the Dairy Bureau, who were all
ilairymen, and who, he claimed, would
not oe likely to order the condemnation
of their own cattle when they were not to
receive compensation for the animals
slain. Then he assumed to be affrighted
at the possibility of a claim against the
State for slain c:ittle, and lastly, entered a
protest pgainst the section which repealed
all acts in conflict with the one under con
sideration. Tnis provision, he pointed
out, would tie the hands of all boards of
supervisors and county boards of health
so tar as dairy inspection was concerned.
Senator Gillette opposed the amend
ment. He cited the States of New York
and Massachusetts in which compensation
was given for condemned diseased ani
mals, and said that a similar policy should
be pursued in California.
Senator Smith spoKe on behalf of the
dairymen of Kern and 9au Luis Gbispo
counties, none of them, he declared, had
cxi reused themselves in favor of the
measure, though a director of the State
Dairy Bureau resided in San Luis Obispo
County, tie btlieved the dancer from
tufoercolosis was greatly exaggerated, and
quoted Professor Alvord of the United
States Bureau of Animal Industry to
show that even when cattle were affected
with tubercolosis they mi(jnt still be valu
able for breeding purposes, and that their
milk ni'cht be safely used if sterilized.
For this reason he argued that if such
cattle are killed they sliouid be paid for.

acknowledged to be fallible, and that un
der its use great injustice would be done
by slaying cows that were perfectly
healthy.
Dickinson responded by stating that the
bill was originated by the dairy people for
the very purpose of exempting cattle from
the tuberculin test, and that the bill con
temnlated the employment of expert
veterinarians to report on tbe condition of
dairy boards, lie said the introduction of
the Dill was due to the fact that last sum
mer a large number of cattle had been
slaughtered in the bay counties under the
tuberculin test. The dairymen, he said,
were not likely to inaugurate a crusade
against their own interests.
The biil was intended to protect the
people in the large majority of counties
where no provisions had been made by
board? of supervisors or boards of health
in the matter. Smith deprecated the asri
tation on the subject, and said it would
injure the markets of the dairymen of the
State. It was placing in the hands of the
producersof vegetable oils a strong weapon
to be used against natural dairy products
with which the vegetable-oil manufactur
ers were in keen competition at the pres
ent time.
Senator Gillette favored the bill, but
wanted the compensatory clause retained.
He held thatoinless something of the kind
proposed were done the San Francisco
market would be closed to the dairymen
of Humboklt and other counties.
Braunhart again called attention to the
fact that the bill as it stood would take
tne matter of dairy inspection out of the
hands of all county boards of health, in
cluding that of San Francisco, and Sen
ator Diccinson agreed to a further amend
ment reading as follows: "Provided that
nothing herein shall in any manner affect
the powers of boards of supervisors or
boards of health."
The amendments we^e adopted and the
bill was ordered re-enerossed. As the bill
now stands it gives the dairymen the
right to kill their own cattle without al
lowing them any compensation for their
losses, find gives the members of the
State Dairy Bureau the power to
appoint an army of veterinary
surgeons and inspectors at the ex
pense of the State, who by virtue of
their obligation to the dairymen who ap
point them would naturally feel delicate
about carrying out their duties in the con
scientious manner that the welfare of the
people at large would demand. So changed
has the measure become under the numer
ous assaults made upon it since its intro
duction that Senaior Dickinson, wnose
name is attached to it as its author, felt
constrained to disavow his paternity of
the measure on the floor of the Senate
to-day.

SONOMA'S RICHES
IN VAST ARRAY
Cloverdale's Annual Citrus
Fair Thrown Open to
Visitors.
Judge Burnett of Santa Rosa
Addresses the First Night's
Gathering.
Wealth of the Valley Displayed in
Baildmg Crowded With Uirque
Ex ibits.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Feb. 17 âAll of
sweet Cloverdale is proud of her citrus fair.
In this instance she haÂ« good reason to be
somewhat vain. In originating and con
tinuing these citrus fairs Cloverdale not
only displays herself as the most enter
prising little city of the Sonoma Valley
but puts on exhibition to the world what
the county can do in the way of citrus
fruits as well as iv wine?. Everybody
knows that Sonoma County wine, in the
battalions of bottles that are stood up like
bo many soldiers all over the United
States, ranks as a commandor-in-chief,
tut it is only in late years that Clover
dale and her lovely environment of cli
mate, soil and hill? has had the ambition
to place before the people of the earth
as spectators or as newspaper readors
what the Bun, the moon and the soil en
ables her to do in the way of oranges,
lemons, limes, figs, prunes, olives and
almonds. No one who beheld the mag
niiicent display of these fruits and nuts as
finally arranged yesterday at the pavilion
could doubt that the Sonoma Valley could
vie with Southern California in the growth
of lemons, oranges, olives and nuts.
The new pavilion recently erected by
the Cioverdale Citrus Society is now occu
pied by the citrr.s fair for the tirst time.
It is better than two and a balf stories
high and 125 leet long, with galleries, and
is one of tlie most imposing public build
ings in the valley.
The entire lower floor is stacked with
citrus fruits. Tlie crowded display of
oranges, lemons, canned and dried fruits
and pickled olives leaves only compara
tively narrow aislos for spectators. All
tlie oranges and lemons are of line qual
ity, and some, which show in the fineness
of the ski:i on their face evidence of
extra careful cultivation, eqtril the best
that are grown in Southern California or
the ban Joaquin Valley. The citrus fair
pavilion was erected under the promoting
enterprise of the Citrus Fair Association
at a cost of abont $3500. It is a perma
nent building, 0:1 a solid roundation, and
will stand for decades of citrus fairs to
come. Toe -tock In the pavilion is held
all over Sonoma County.

In addition to the foregoing exhibits
there is a very creditable art gallery and a
taxidermist's* exhibit by Charles Muller
and Will Adams. Not long apo coal was
discovered about five miles from Clover
dale, on the ranch of John Caldweil. He
has some of ;he coal on exhibition. Mrs.
H. M. Whitney displays fancy needle
work.
This was the opening night of the citrus
fair and it was a success in every way.
The new pavilion was crowded with the
loyal and enterprising people of Clover
dale and the immediate vicinity. The
oranpe carnival colors witn which the
pavilion is draped, the many hghts, the
pyramids of goiden fiuit anu the moving
throng formed a scene that would do
credit to a city many times the population
of Cloverdale.
But, like the Hellenic raco, which is
now flaunting heroic defiance in the face
of the Sultan, the people of the North
Sonoma Valley are not lacking in spirit;
when they undertake anything, they do
not do it in a half-hearted manner. They
are proud of their fair, and visitors from
the valley and other localities agree in the
opinion that in citrus fruits and enter
prise the Sonoma Valley is among the
most fertile in the State.
To-morrow will be a great day. It is
Sonoma County's day. Even the oldest
inhabitants are preaching that West
street to-morrow will be as crowded with
visitors a? Market and Kearny streets are
every afternoon from 4 to (i o'clock.
People are expected from all over the
valley on a number of excursion trains.
An address will be delivered in tbe even
ing by K. A. Thompson o? Santa Rosa.
Friday will be Mendociuo and Lake
County day, and an address will be de
ljvere.i in the evening by Mrs. Anna Mor
rison Reed of Uniah.
To-night Attorney George W. Hoyle
presided at the fair and introduced the
principal speaker. Judge A. G. Burnett of
Santa Rosa.
The Judge began by saying that the fine
exhibits spoke more "eloquently than
words of the fertility and resources of the
Sonoma Valley. Notwithstanding the
large amount of advertising that bad been
done in the East, he believed that Eastern
people in general, and the inhabitants of
the bleak Atlantic coast in particular,
were lamentably lacking in information
on California in general and the great
Sonoma Valley in particular. Sonoma's
litiht could not be hidden under a bushel;
it would yet te known tuat this was the
spot that nature bad designed to honor
In one of her mo*t alluring moods.
Judge Burnett svofce eloquently of the
vocation of a husbandman. One of the
things he could not understand was that
young men preferred to wear away their
lives with the yardstick or posing on
street corners in the city io living an. l
earning an honorable and self-respecting
livelihood on the farm. He urged young
men to take examples from the living
present more than from the dead paÂ«t.
Diverting into economics, the Judge said
the people were losing the power ol mak
ing price* as they were of making nomi
nations. Great price factories were beine
built up in the East which tended to rob
the farmer of the just dues for his In
dustry.
The Cloverdale Cornet b:\nd rendered in
good style a fine musical programme.
Among lhe special numbers was a cornet
duet by Professor ]>. C. Smith and Mia
Mabel Smith.
T A CO MA'S STRANGE SECT.
Pastor Harnman of. the "Come- Outers" ,
Begins Another Fast and Secret
- Communion.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 17.â Rev. N. 11.
Harriman, former pastor of the First
Babiist Church, has shut himself up for
another socret session with God.
He in fasting ami his followers are anx- |
iously awaiting to learn bis experience J
when he again appears at their meetings. |
The "corne-ouiers" who loft the Baptist
Church have been holding nightly meet
ings. Lajt evening Mr. Harriman did I
not appear, but sent his son with a letter 1
in which he said :
Dear Brethren and Sisters: 1 have received
permission to-night of the Fatherâ or rather
I am Instructed by the Father â come aside
with him awhile. Some of you will under
stand mis. 1 .shall not be present again,
therefore, till he sends me out. I hope that it
will not be for a long time, for the work seems
pressing. It will, however, be better in the
end, for he is going to pour out his spirit upon
the work before long.
Mr. llnrriman also asked bis concrega
tion to prey for his family and to advocate 1
the "divine healing" part of their work, j
His letter points out that the Bible gives
the sect tne right to claim "healing" as
well as "justification" and "sanctirka
tion."
Mr. Harriman is now very weak and |
weary from his fasting and activity of the I
last month. He and Mr-. Harriman are
recovering from severe attacks of la
grippe. Their children have now been
taken down. The united prayers of his
followers are asked thai they may be
cured.
The meetings of the "come outers" are
taken up with discussions of the various
doctrines they have embodied in their
faith.
WRECK AT STOCKTON.
Engine and Cars 'on Ihe Corral Hollow
Railroad Topple Over an Em
bankment.
STOCKTON, Cat... Feb. 17. â An accident
occurred at. the coal bunkers of the Ala
meda and San Jouquin Valley Railroad
shortly belo c 6 o'clock this evening, in
which the engineer, fireman and other
trainmen narrowly escaped injury.
The bunkers of the coal road are in the
western part of the city, near the junc
tion of Mormon and Stockton channels.
During the recent high water thai section
was inundated, and the ground about ihe
tracks and the bunkers is still very wet.
The Coal-road engine attempted to as
cend the huh trestle leading to the bunk
er- late this afternoon, and now the engine
and two cars are lying in the mud at ti.e
side of the embankment.
As the track turns and ascends the
trestle there is a high embankment.
This had become loosened during the
high water. The engine had two cars in
front and two behind. The first two cars
were pushed over the earth embankment
and onto the trestel, andbefore the engine,
which weichs fifty-five tons, could pass
over it, the earth slid out and the engine
and tender began to topple over.
As it turned in its fall, Engineer J. P.
Bennett and Fireman W. H. Bergen
jumped, and so did Conductor J. W. Ding
ruan and Brakemen Hank Neff and Clif
ford BjgÂ«>. None were injured, as the
bank was only eight feet high at this point.
As the engir.e turned the valve in the
whistle was opened, and the iron monster
called for help for half an hour while
lying helpless in the mud. The two rear
cars went over with the engine and ten
der, but those that had reached the trestle
remained on the irack.

STRUVE FAILS TO
OBTAIN DAMAGES
Decision in Favor of the
Western Beet Sugar
Company.
Manufacturing Interests Win
Important Litigation at
Santa Cruz
Da!ma3 & Shortridge's fil.ticn for a
Nonsuit GraDtd by Judge
Smith.
SANTA CRUZ, Cai... Feb. 17.â There
was quite a stir In court circles in Santa
Cruz this afternoon when the Judge's de
cision in the damage suit of Struve vs. the
"Western Beet Sugar Company was handed
down in response to a motion for a non
suit made by the defendant's counsel.
This case has been id progress before
Judge Smith of the Superior Court for
nearly three weeks.
The plaintiff in the action brought suit
to recover damages from the sugar com
pany in the sum of $20,000 for an alleged
injury resulting from the depositing of
beet pulp irorn the factory upon land
alleged to be ownod by the plaintiff,
James M. Struve of Watsonville. Delnias
ifc Shortrldge represented the defendant,
while the plaintiff's case was in the hands
of two local attorneys. Mr. Shortridge
personally conducted the defense, attend
ing steadily during the entire period of
the proceedings.
The importance of the case soon became
manifest. It was readily perceived by all
concerned that it involved a more than
local principleâ perhaps a decisive cri
terion of the treatment which beet-sugar
manufacturers all over the country might
be expected to receive and abide by in the
future. It vergpd also upon the principle
of how much sufferance manufacturing in
general might be deemed privileged to
enjoy in the matter of causing incon
venience to private communities by their
necessary smoke, refuse matter, etc.
The plaintiff maintained that the odor
from the decayine pulp had injured his
health and comfort to the extent of $5000,
while the water draining from the millions
of tons of pulp had damaged his land to
tlie extent of $15,000. The defense showed
that the beet-sugar factory was estab
lished eight years before at a cost of sev
eial hundred thousand dollars; in 1890 it
had been enlarged to double its original
capacity; and in 1592 had been enlarged
again to twice its former capacity.
Altogether over $1*, 000, 000 had been ex
pended upon the plant. During all this
time the plaintiff had made no complaint,
but had regularly sold beets, to the fac
tory. If the pulp were a nuisance now it
must have beer, for eight years, and one
wuo had uncomplainingly permitted and
abetted it for eight years should now be
estopped from complaining. Further
more, it was shown that water from beets
is not poisonous, and that the plaintiff
had during the trial sold some of his land !
for a price that did not indicate that it I
had depreciated as be claimed.
It wasalso shown that the plaintiff had
ft flpsty containing 152 hogs within ten
feet of his front door; that only 200 feet
away were the corrals of the Watsonville
Creamery and Cattle Company, in which
were from 1700 to 2000 cattle all the tune,
and that not far distant was the dumping I
ground of a slaughter-house; and yet i
above all these the plaintiff detected and
was annoyed by the odor of the pulp
some distance away.
Last Friday the litigation reached a
point where the defendant's couns-1 found
it tenable to make a motion for a nonsuit
on several distinct grounds and the caÂ«e
went over pending the Judge's decision,
which was promised for t(j-d?y.
When the attorneys and tlie jury reas
sembled this morning a crowded court
room awaited them. The decisio.i was
postponed until the afternoon, when the
scene of excited interest was repeated and
greatly increased when the Judge ren
dered hie decision in favor of the de
fendant.
This evening there is considerable talk
of the case on the street, and general sat
isfaction at the result is manifested.
Every one seems to feel that a decision in
favor of manufacturing, as represented by
the Watsonville sugar factory, which is
greatly appreciated for its vast benefit to
the community, has been rendered.
WALKS FROM STOCKTON ASYLUM.
San Francisco Real Estate Agent Re-
leased on Habeas Corpus
Prcceed/ngs.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 17.â W. P.
Coward, a real estate a.ent, who has for
only a month been an inmate of the
State Insane Asylum here, yesterday ap
plied to the Superior Court for a writ of
habeas corpus, commanding Superintend
ent Clark of the institution to produce
him in court this forenoon at 10 o'clock
and to show cause why he should not be
released from confinement. The writ was
issued laic yesterday afternoon and served
upon Dr. Clark last evening, and to-day
JuUge Budd ordered Coward's release.
Coward was committed to the madhouse
on January 2(5, being at that time so
violent that it took several men to bring
him to the institution. He continued in
that condition for several days, and was
raving when the committee of legislators
visited the asylum. The man's reason
returned as buddenly as v had disap
peared, and a week ago he appeared to
have entirely recovered. He besought
the asylum authorities to discharge him,
but they hesitated, as they thought the
case should be given a longer test. The
patient, being of an energetic nature,
chafed under the restraint, and yesterday
decided to take legal steps lor his dia
charce.
Coward's reason abandoned him in the
Palace Hotel. Later his dementia took a
violent form and his wife and children
feared for their safety. After the trial
to-day it was intimated that Coward be
lieves that he was "railroaded" to the
asylum. He says that he was never in
sane, but was only prostrated by over
work.

TURFMAN RAYMOND
PASSES THE WIRE
Owner of Speedy Klamath
Succumbs to Heart
Trouble.
His Illness Induced by Grief
Over the Death of His
Wife.
The End Hastened by Worry Caused
by a Published Report That
Hi Was Insane.
SANTA ANA, Cal., Feb. 17.â Thomas
Raymond, owner of the famous trotter
Klaruath, and one of the beat known
horsemen of the country, died in Los
Angeles this morning from heart disease,
with which he had been troubled for some
months past. His death is considered by
friends here to have been caused prin
cipally by grief over tho death of his wife,
who passed away in Michigan six months
ago while they were on the Eastern circuit
with Klanmh.
Previous to his wife's death Mr. Ray
mond was an unusually vigorous and
robust man, but he never seemed to re
cover from the shock occasioned by her
loss, and rapidly became a victim of serious
heart trouble, augmented by a complica
tion of other diseases which were never
fnlly diagnosed by physicians. The end
had been momentarily expected by those
fully cognizant of his condition for some
time. He went to Los Angeles on Monday
with a niece for medical treatment. A
statement that he was insane, published
quite generally a few weeks ago, worried
him greatly and undoubtedly hastened
the end. As a matter of fact he was at no
time alHicted will insanity. An attack
of heart trouble seized him at the West
minster Hotel in Los Angeles, and his
struggles were wrongly taken as an indica
tion of loss of reason. The body will be
brought to Santa Ana to-morrow and will
be interred on Friday beside that of his
wife.
It is generally understood that Ktamath
was bequeathed to Gilbert Judd, Ray
mond's racing partner, who lived here
with him fur years.

Sullenly the Highbinder
Goes to Death on
the Gallows.
Refuses to Give Information
Concerning His Relatives
in China.
His Crime the Beheading of Two
Mongolian Women and a Man
in Mono County.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal.. Feb. 17.â A man
was executed at San Quentin prison to
day, but the event wns entirely lacking in
: the usual dramatic features or interest in
such ocrasion?. lie was Chun Sing, pre
sumably from China, though in appear
ance and characteristics he was more like
an islander or a Malay than a genuine
Celestin-1.
Very few persons felt interest enough to
attend the hanging, nuraberins not more
than thirty, and they mostly sheriffs or
connected officially with criminal law.
'â â â  The condemned has been an Ishmael in
/â¢â " prison. He was sullen and morose.
f j:V would not talk, and was as quiet and
' i/idifferent to his surroundings as a man
without environment. He would have
nothing to do with pries* or clergy, notb
ine to say to visitors or to his guards.
Chinese had asked him who his friends at
home were, that they might be informed
of his fate, but he would not answer.
Warden Hale being absent from the
prison the execution was conducted by
Captain Edg^r, who read the death war
rant to the condemned man in his cell at
9 o'clock this morning. He was then
dresÂ«ed for the scaffold and marched to it
nt 10:30 o'clock. On arriving at the trap,
thouch his step was firm, he, after placing
one foot on it, sopped. Theguard behind
him placed the other foot on for him, the
noose was instantly adjusted, the trap fell
and that was all. Just as he reached the
scaffold he made an ejaculation, indistinct,
hut he appeared to be thanking the guards
for their kindness to him. He died with
out a struggle, his neck having been
broken. He fell at 10:31 and at 10:47 was
pronounced Head and the body was re
moved. Dr. V. S. Stern was the atter.d
iDg physician. The same nameless guards
who always officiate managed the dis
agreeable job.
Th< murders for which Chun Ping was
hanced were committed in October, 1895,
and were the result of. a tong quarrel be
tween him and several members of a rival
empany. Among the good Chinamen of
Lundy, whicli is a canyon mining camp
on the other side of the Sierras, across
Irom the Yosemite Valley, was Ah Foot:.
He was one of the men against whom
Chun Sing nursed an enmity. Sing, after
deciding to settle their troubles, armed
himself with an ax and went to Ah Fook's
house. He attacked Fook at once and cut
him badly, but did not kill him. Ah
Fook's wife ran screaming from the
bouse, but was overtaken in her flight by
the murderer, who brained her with his
ax, Chun Sing then went to the house of
a Chinaman named Cbarley Tai, whose
head he cut off with the ax. Another
Chinese woman, who ran from Tai's
house, was followed by the murderer and
lie chopped her into a horrible mass with
his gory weapon. He was sentenced to
death last December and the execution
; lace without an appeal to the Su
preme Court.

his paper not what he thought was best,
but what the public wanted. He did not
care, personally, whether there was free
dom or slavery.
Horace Greeley was an entirely different
man. He was always governed by what
he thought was rijibt. This he printed,
whether the public likÂ«-d it or not. _ lie
had more friends than Bennett. When
the Democrats were looking around for a
suitable Presidential nominee their eyes
lell upon him. He was foolish enough to
believe that lie was born to be President
of the United States. Gree;ey was mis
taken and defeat killed him.
During the evening Mr. Bonner "poked
a little fun" at J)r. Jordan, who presided.
The worthy head of the Stanford faculty
smiled good-naturedly|witli the audience.
He managed to even up scores in a lecture
this morning, wl.ich Jlr. Bonner and a
party of j'oung ladies attended. During
the lecture, Dr. Jordan pleasantly re erred
to John Bonner and hiru-elf as "pieres of
antiquated crockery." The former, wlio is
proud of the fact that he is a general
favorite witn the ladies, arose, and with
mock seriousness, refused to be classed as
"an old piece of crockery" before so many
charming young women.
Dr, Jorditi waited an instant until the
laughter aud murmur of applause ceased.
Then, wit eyes twinkling, he assured the
journalist that the most beautiful unrt
cultured young ladies often prized
antiquated chine and crockery most of all.
Mr. Bonner bowed his acknowledgment,
and the lecture proceeded.
GENERAL PLEAS ANTON DEAD.
The Famous Cavalry Leader Distinguished
Himself in Both the Mexican and
Civil Wars.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 16.-Gen
eral Alfred Pieasanton, the famous cav
alry leader, died in this city early this
morning.
Alfred Pleasnnton was born in Wash
ington, D. C, June 7, 18J4, and was grad

He distinguishpd himself in the battles of

doty, and steadily rose in rank until at
the outbreak of the war in 1861 he was
commissioned major of the Second
Cavalry.
He served throngb the Virginia penin
sula campaign, becoming brigadier-gen
eral of volunteers, and commanded thn
cavalry division of the nrmy that followed
Lee into Maryland. He participated in
tue actions at Boonesborouch, South
Mountain and Antietam and Fredericks
burg, and stayed the further advance of
the army at Chancellorsville.
On May 2, when Johnson's corps was
coming down on the right flank of Hook
er's army, having already routed How
ard's corps, Pleaianton saved the day. By
a bold charge he delayed Jackson's pro
gress lon;> enou^ti to <:et the artillery into

came within range it was met With a
storm of izrape and canister that could not
be withstood. Just about this t.me Jack
son fell and darkness put an end to the
battle.
In June, 18G3. he was made major-pren

the engagements preceding the oat'le of
Gettysburg and was commander-in-chief

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1897.
THE SHELL MOUND
WENT TO CASPAR
Burns and Water-house's
Colt Won in a
Canter.
At Odds On, Schiller Only Eeat
Morte Fonse in a Hard
Drive.
Favorites Swept the Card, Taking
All Six Eventsâ Hermcso a
Promising Young Star.
Outside of the sweeping of the deck by
the nix favoritea at Emeryville track yes
terday, the special attraction of the day's
racing was the capture of the Shell
Mound handicap at seven furlongs by
Camper, the Burns & Waternouse entry.
The colt looked very pleasantly situ
ated with 115 pounds on his back, and
with Scarf Pin scratched on accoant of
her impost, he was a pronounced 3 to 5
favorite in the betunz. Away well, be
led throughout, winning; easily from Tor
pedo, a 20 to 1 shot. The rank outsider,
Kuselle, against which as high as 300 to 1
was laid, finished in the show. The Rose
stable. Tea Roe and Hannetta, second
choices in the betting coupled, finished
back in the ruck, evidently through, poor
stable orders.
The attendance was about the best of
the week, and some lively wagering was
indulged in by the crowd. The track was
muddy, which was evidently to the liking
of the favored ones in the betting, for one
a fter another they led their fields first past
the judges, and the talent left for home
with "all colors."
In the match race over two miles be
tween Morte Fonse and Schiller thÂ«
crowd came v cry nearly being treated to a
surprise. Both horses were carrying equal
weights (106 pounds), and Barney Schrei
ber's colt was dished up as the hottest
sort of a 3 to 10 favorite, with 13 to Â£
aeainst Morte Fonse. Slaughter on th<
favorite cut out the pace for one and aquar
ter miles, when Thorpe sent the Fonse
horse along, and it took the hardest sort
of riding on Slaughter's part to win bj
a head. The first mile was covered in
1:5 5}.,', the whole distance in 3:44%.
Slaughter famished a fumbling exhibi
tion astride the winner.
Hermoso, a handsome looking chestnut
colt by Sir Modred from F.delity, was
backed to a standstill by Dave Gideon and
all the wne ones, going to the post a 2 to 1
favorite over the other ten two-year-olds
in the opening three and a half furlong
scramble. The youngster beat the barrier,
and leading the buncii into the stretch by
ten or fifteen lencths won easing ud from
Koxey Murphy in 45 seconds. Rosa,
owned by Tom Kiley, was a close third.
A fair field went to the post in the next
event, a six furlong pur>e affair, of which
Arrezzo and The Sinner looked to have the
most ciass. The stable money went in on
Arrezzo, sending him to the post a slight
favorite over Mr. ll. inn's gelding. Most
of the others went back in the betting.
After some delay at the post, caused by
the unruly actions of the favorite, the
field was sent away well bunched. Tbe
s:nner led to the stretch, where he began
stopping badly and washeaded by Atrezzo
and L 'St Girl, the former winning handily
by three parts of a length in 1:19^. In a
hard drive Nine N.nety Nine secured the
show.
A mile selling dash that was fourth on
the card went to the 6 to 5 choice, Moylan,
ridden by Tod Sloan. Two Cheers and
Walter J led the bunch until passing the
lar turn, when the favorite forged lo the
front, and at the wire won handily by
over a length in 1:47^. The hot tip
Tbornbill was second, iv front of Two
Cheers.
Ed Corrigan's juniper, Reddington,
proved the best of tt;e jumpers in the hur
dle handicap at one mile and three-eighths.
He was a consistent 4 to 5 favorite in the
betting and downed Hello without notiee
nble effort, doing the distance in 2:42.
Zara.-ozi was a distant third, with the
others strung out in processional order.
NO iES.
Owing to the inconsistent running of the
jumper Gold Dust the judges decided at
tbe conclusion of the hurdle event to rule
out his entry in future.

EUREKA DAMAGE SUITS.
Four Additional Actions Resulting From
the Mad River Bridge
Disaster.
EUREKA, Cal., Feb. 17.â As an after
math of the accident on the Arcata and
Mad River Railroad last September four
suits were begun yesterday for the aggre
gate sum of $100,000. The largest of these
is that of Mrs. Minnie Wood, who sues for
$45,265 for injuries received. Mrs. Wood
suffered several fractures, the worst being
that of the pelvis bone, which was crushed
almost beyond the power of physicians to
give relief. Only recently has she been
able to leave her house, although the acci
dent occurred five months ago.
The second largest suit is that of David !
Wood, husband of Minnie Wood. His in- i
juries were confined to the bead, lie has
almost lost sicht of one eye, and his other
injuries incapacitate him from earning a
livelihood. He asks for $25,300. Mr. and
Mrs. Wood suffered the 10.-s of their two |
little daughter*. Clarisa and Sophie, in
the accident. For this they as* $20,000. i
In addition to these suits Mr. and Mrs. |
Wood bring suit for $10,000 because
through the injury to Mrs. Wood sne will
in future be unable to bear children.

FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY.
Great Preparations Being Made
ior the March 17 Cele
bration.
Exercises in the Pavil on and Metre*
politan Temple â Excursions From
Other Cities-
Great preparations are being made for
the celebration of tit. Patrick's day, March
17, and, judging from the tirst efforts of
the committee in charge of the affair, it
will be equal if not superior to any that
has taken place in the past in this City.
The general committee, consisting of one
delegate irom each of the Irish-American
societies, met last evening at Knights ot
the Red Branch Hall. Jerome Deasy pre
sided and C. B. Flanaagaa clliciated as
secretary.
The first matter decided was that in the
afternoon of March 17 the literary exer
cises would be held in Metropolitan Hal!,
and that in the evening a grand prome
nade concert will be held in the Mechan
ics' Pavilion. At the hall the exercises
will consist of an oration by the orator of
the day. A poem will be read or recited.
Whether it will be an original poem or not
has been left in the hands of the literary
committee. The other features of the alt
ernoon will be songs, recitations, etc.
The exercises at the Pavilion in the
evening will be carried out on a grand
scale. It was decided to encage Alfred
Roncovieri's band of union musicians, to
consist of at least thirty pieces. The band
will render music that is to be illustrated
by a large number of elegant stereopticon
views thrown upon a huge cauvas in the
rear of the building in full sight of all.
In fact, it will be a promenade concert, in
terspersed with taking features, such as
chomsp-, quartets and novelties, not yet
decided upon. The sentiment of the com
mittee was that no pains or money should
be spared to furnisu the audiencu with a
splpniid entertainment.
After considerable discussion tho ad
mission fees were declared to be as fol
low*: Tot c exercises in the afternoon in
the hall: Alults, 50 cents; children. 25
cents. To f:e Pavilion in the evening.
25 cents for all.
Chairman Dea?y was selected to ananpe
for an icecream and refreshment-stand for
the evening, but it was distinctly directed
that no wines, liquors or Deer should bo
sold or served.
The literary committee was enlarged by
the addition of David Costello. G. E.
Gallajrher, Thomas Crowley and FrauK
Conklin. A press committee was formed,
consisting of D. Costello, C. B. Flannagan
and Dr. I. W. O'Rourke. A printiugcom
mittee was also appointed, consisting of
M. J. Connolly. William Mnlvin, P. H.
Flynn, Dr. ORourke nna J. P. Disnan.
Secretary Fiannagan reported that the
several railroad officials had promised the
committee a reduction in the rates of
lares from the adjoining larsre cities. For
small parties a one and a half rate will be
charged for round-trip tickets, and for
large excursions half rates will be allowed.
All tickets will hold good until the follow
ing evening, so that the excursionists may
attend the exercises in the Pavilion.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.

TOE FAKE AND THE FACT.
THE FAKE
The Examiner published for several days at the
lop of its title page th* following fa*e:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches

5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake tho Examiner
was protabiy not aware that a careful record was
being kept of th- actual amouui in Inch's Of Us

confrouted with the following fact.
THE PACT
THE EXAMINER FUELISHED
236,528 Inches

That is one fact and here is an-
other :

THE CALL than in the

It Is to be remembered that daring 1898 the.
Examiner published api roximu;e!y 830 fucnes of
:.:e>al lolt-ry advertisements, of waich The Call

ihe mot.arc-i of thf faicerj has doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of inches of adver-

would seem, however, from the facts that the

fraudulent p-etenses.
Ihe Examiner boasts that Its books are open to

THE PAN-HELLENIC SPIRIT.
Because the people of Crete have of late suffered no great indignities from Turkish
rule there is a tendency on the part of some Americans to hold them guilty of an nnÂ«
justifiable war in their present insurrection against the Turkish power. Some critics
claim to see in the outbreak evidence of a conspiracy on the part either of Russia or
of Great Britain to force the Turkish question to a setUement by the outbreak of a
war, while others argue that diplomatists outside the countries named have been
instrumental in getting up the agitation as a bold play to force the hands of both
Russia and Great Britain and compel them to take action.
There is no sufficient reason on which to base any of these assertions of secret
conspiracies and diplomatic intrigues. The people of Crete have for more tnan a gen
eration past shown an earnest desire to be rid of Turkish rule and to be united in one
nation with their fellow Greeks of the mainland. This spirit of race patriotism is suf
ficient to account for all that baa taken place in the island. Men who are devoted to
liberty anÂ«i to tho idea of a great nationality need no conspirators from the outside to
urge them on. They are ever ready and willing to seize every opportunity which
promises success to their arms and the accomplishment of their patriotic dream*.
Th* inhabitants of the Greek islands n^w under Turkish rule are as eaeer for a
united Greek nation as were the Germans to form a nation in the old days when Ger
many was simply a geographical expression. Theirs is the same impulse which
moved the Italians to incessant insurrections until a united Italy was established.
They are animated by the same motive which inspired the patriots of the?e colonies
to revolt against tho Government of King George in order to erect a free, separate,
sovereign and independent Government of their own.
The grievances of which the Cretes complain under Turkish rnle are of a kind
that are sometimes derided as sentimental. It is conceded that Crete has been by far
the most leniently governed province of the Turkish empire. No great atrocities have
been inflicted upon the people of that country as upon those of Armenia. They have
been allowed a large liberty of self-government and their property and their lives have
been oecure from any outbreak of Moslem misrule or fanaticism. To those men who
see no cause for war except when wrong is done to person or property the Cretan
patriot? appear as will.'ul and lawless disturbers of the peace of Europe. Fortunately
this class of men are few. The great majority of mankind shares in sentiments of
patriotism and sympathizes with all who revolt against any form of domination by an
alien race or a foreign power no matter how lenient it may b3.
It is the old issue of the eternal battle for liberty ana independence against even
the most benevolent despotism or the most trivial injustice. As Hampden said of his
revolt against the imposition of ship money by Charles I: "It was not that the pay
ment of twenty shillings would ruin his estate, but that the payment of half twenty
shiilings woula have made him a slave." Our forefathers in 1770 fcught not against
tne money payments involved in the stamp tax. but against the principle of taxation
without representation. These questions of principle affect every people who are
capable of understanding liberty and lnw and thoÂ«e who are unwilling to fight for
such principles are incapable of establishing a self-governing nation.
The uprising in Crete is in the fullest ond truest sense a patriotic outbreak. It is
an evidence of the power of that Fan-Helienic spirit which will sooner or later bring
all the Greeks together in one nation as surely as a similar spirit among the Italians
and the Germans has made those countries great and powerful nations. These popu
lar movements are mightier than the plans of statesmen or the intrigues of diploma
tists. It is as impossible to crush them as it is impossible to exterminate a race. In
deed the one cannot be achieved without the other. So long as ihe GreeK race lives in
( rete so long will it cherish Greek aspirations, and until those asp-rations have been
gloriously realizad tho peace of the world will be disordered and disturbed.
AN EXTRAORDINARY BILL
Among the mm r measures submitted
to 'he Legislature which are of a nature
sufficiently extraordinary to provoke more
than ordinary comment is Spnatp bill 28
which proposes the appointment in this
City of an official to be known as "Special
ist in Sociological E luc.ition."
The proposed official is to be appointed
in art}- city or county wtiere the clailv at
tendance at schools exceeds 25,000 or
where the inmates of prisons, reforma
tories, almshousss and hospitals exceed
1000. He is to receive the same pay as the
Superintendent of Schools in the county
where he is appointed, and in San Fran
cisco would cetstOOO a year. The Super
visors are required to furnish rooms for
his offices. He is to have $500 a year for
stationery and office expenses, is to be
allowed to employ a shorthand reporter,
whose compensation shall be one-half the
amount now allowed official reporters in
the Superior courip, and *uch clerical and
other assistance as the Supervi or 3 may
deem reasonable.
The employment of the "Specialist in
Sociological Education" is to be made by
the Superintendent of Schools, Sheriff
and Recorder. H? is to continue in office
for t c same perio.t that the regular claps
of teachers of the primary ami grammar
schools are now appointed. This means
a virtual tenancy of the ollica for life, <
since there will be no power to try the
specialist for unprofessional conduct or
netrlect of dutj', as there is in the case of
teachers.
The duties which are to be expected of
this extraordinary official are many. lie
is to study crime and pauperism with
reference to drunkenness and the use of
opium ; to inquire into the causes which
produce criminals and paupers and sug
gest remedies. He is to prepare for cir
culation among the mothers of school
children and teachers sociological litera
ture containing suggestions for eradicat
ing evil tendencies in mind ana body. He
is to collect and report upon the details
relating to the different branches of soci
ology and the several subdivisions of crim
inal anthropology, copies o! which reports
are to be tiled with the Superintendent of
Schools, Recorder, Sheriff, Ls_ iaiatnre,
Governor and the principals of State
normal schools.
His Dnvi leges are to be almost as numer
ous as his duties. He is to have free ac
cess to pll institutions for the purpose of
investigating social pathology and may
ba permitted to perform autopsies upon
the bodies of deceased persons. He may
uct as counsel in criminal trials where the
defense is insanity, and any person who
impedes or prevents him in the full ami
free performance of his office is to be held
guilty of a misdemeanor.
The bil hardly needs comment The
creation of an official of this kind is cer
tainly one of theluxuries which San Fran
cisco can do without. It will cost at least
110,000 a year to pay his salary and run
his office. He comes too high. We do
not need him In our educational system
half as much as we need some new rare
animal iv the zoological car Jens at the
park. The bill is a good one to be
dropped in the wustebasket.
The constitutional convention now in ses
sion in Delaware has adopted a proposition
to punish bribe-takers by fine and impris
onment, and try them belore a board of
judges instead of by jury. It is also de
clared a witness shall not have a right to
decline to give evidence on 'he ground
that he might be incriminated. Tnus are
two of the most venerable precedents of
our law set asifJe in order to try another
experiment at making people honest by
statute.
A man rushed into the oflice of a doctor

the man had gone and taten with him
every portable thing of value he could

It is announced tnat McKinley will ex
ercise great care in selecting men for thu
consular service, as he wishes to have in
tnose offices men who will be of use in de
veloping our commerce with foreign na
tions. That menns business.
All the statesmen of Europe seem to be
greatly worried lest the Turks should
whip Greece, but the Greeks are not show
in? any worry. They continue to sail
away for Crete with a gleam of victorj in
their eyes.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY IS, 1897.
THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
In hi? efforts to restore the prosperity of
the country, Major McKinley intends to
make his term of office a business admin
istration in every respect. All reports
that come to us from those who are close
to him and can speak with authority
make it certain that there is no pan of our
industrial or commercial life to which he
will not giv-> close attention and every
help which lies in his power.
Among the features of the administra
tion which will mar* its devotion to the
business welfare of the country will be the
selections made for the consular strvice.
F. B. Loomis, who has been the Canton
correspondent of the New York Tribune
ever since the St. Louis convention, and
who has had full ot portuniti-^s for seeing
the President-eiect and learning his opin
ions, has recently written to his paper an
article setting for:!> ihe careful considera
tion which Mr. McKinley will give to the
selection of men for foreign appointments.
Mr. Loo ml* says:
It is the ambition of the President-elect,
above all other tninÃÃ, to advance the bus.
-ness interests of this country, to expand for
eign markets and to contribute to the sub
stantial restoration oi abundant, normal prus
penty. No man will bo considered for an uj>
pointment of the slightest consequence who Is
not believed lo be willing and aile to do
â ometatac to i crease the demand for Ameri
can products abroad. Major McK>nley wants
gentlemen in the foreign service and wants
men of education, culture und ideas, who
w.li, in their bearing, their acts, official deeds
and utterances, exemplify the best, truest and
h.ghest type ot American citizenship. Be
will have no use whatsoever for drones or for
rich ialers who hope to become sumptuous
loungers about foreign cnpiiuls.
The importance of the proposed new de
parture iv our consular scyv.ee cannot be
overrated. It has lone been known that
the management of our foreign commer
cial relations has been the weak point in
our Government. While the Consuls of
other countries have been chosen for
their fitness to advance the commerce of
their merchants, and find new markets
for the produce of the industries of thÂ«
people, our Consuls have been to a consid
erable extent either negligent of these
duties or incapable of rightly performing
them.
No one has spoken more severely of the
defects in our consular service than some
of tlic more earnest members of that ser
vice themselves. It is In fact a well
known truth that we lose a large propor
tion of tlie trade of foreipn countries
-â imply because our Consuls abroad are not
sufficiently well informed concerning tne
Commerce of their own counirv to know
how to promote it in the markets of the
ports at which they are stationed.
The nee 1 of a patriotic and intelligent
consular service Is every where recognized.
The importance of improvement in this
department of the Government is hardly
less great than a revibion of the tariff. We
must have not only revived industries,
but wider and broader markets for their
products, and the McKinley administra
tion will deserve well of the country if it
carries out successfully the policy which
it promises to undertake.
GALVESTON'S IMPROVED HAEBOS
One of the greatest achievements of
modern engineering skill is the deepening
of Galveston's harbor from fifteen to
twenty-five feet by the building of the
immense jetties which have just been
completed. The work is a triumph for
the engineers and a striking exampie of
the advance of human power over the
forces of nature. The jetty far surpasses
in magnitude any ever constructed before.
The problem involved in the exploit was
a puzzling one to the most experienced
engineers. The success has been signal
and the results to the commerce and gen
eral development of the Southwestern
States will constitute a new era for that
section.
There are two of theso jettiesâ one four
miles long and the other six. Each is
tifiv feet wide at the base and from twelve
to fifteen feet wid* on top. The founda
tion is a wide layer of yandstono thirty
feet wide and three feet thick. Tne main
body of the structure consists of a mass of
broken rock dumped into the water from
a railway built on pile?, and over all is a
layer of immense granite blocks weighing
from two to ten tons plstced so close
together that they make almost a solid
granite wall. The two jetties are a mile
apart. The expectation is that they will
endure aa long as the earth keeps the even
tenor of its way. The Government ex
pended |6,400.000 on them, and the harbor
can now be entered by the great ocean
going vessels of the world.
The men who planned this vast con
siruction had to contend with the dis
couragement of the adverse criticism of
some of the most authoritative engineers.
It was said that the distance of a mile
was too far apart to place the jetties, and
as a consequence the waters would not be
sufficiently concentrated to cut out the
harbor bars. The United States engineers
had the courage of conviction and per
sisted in their plan. For four year?, as
the work progressed and the millions of
dollars were being dumped into the sea,
the prophets of failure had promise of
being able to say, "I told you so," for the
obstructing sand persistently stayed on
the harbor bara.
Toward the end of the construction,
however, the bars began to make frequent
shifts of their position. They did not go
away, but tbey showed that the work of
man's bands was Having some tremendous
inlluence upon the doings of that mighty
sea wnich is so calculated to impress him
with the puniness of his powers. Human
skill pushed the great graniie arms a mile
or so furthei out in the sea, and then the
obedient waves performed man's bidding
swiftly and perfectly. The lamp of Alad
din to summoa the genii of the deep to
toil at human command could scarcely
have furnished romance with a more
marvelously executed feat. The force of
the confined water opened a channel
twenty-nve feet deep and a mile wide.
Vast as the work is, it cost us as a Nation
a trifle less than 9 cents apiece. It was for
the able-bodied people of this country
considered collectively about an hour's
job. As the thrifty farmer said to hi 9
harvest hands, we might do li:tla joha
lite that while we are resting. It was
practically the same thing as if we all got
up an hour ear Her some tine morning and
finished the work before breakfast.

more originality in conception ai:d technique

foreign to her nature, and she haa grieved

rection I ought to look. I hope to goodness I
shan't have to p'.ay there again. The Waldorf
is all very well for a debutante who needs a
friendly launching from society friends, but
as for me I want to be brought face to face with
the great public and not depend upon any one
class for support. When my manager met me
at the steamer and informed me I was to play
at the Waldorf I was aghast, and did not hesi
tate to tell him so. 'But my dear Mme. Car
reno we must have society with us,' he remon
strated. 'Bother society,' I replied. 'Society
is all very well of itself, but it is best not to
m.x it up with art.' "
There was a time when the Royal Theater of
Madrid was one of the most flourishing opera
houses in Europe, but lately it has fallen into
a state of utter decadence. A Madrid news
paper, El Campenon, asks: "What would the
managers of former times say iJ taey could
come from their graves and see the state of
things going on at the opera-house? Tiie
management has sent away Mme. Adalgisa
Gabbi, whom the public wanted and insisted
on having; it could not pay Mme. Teresa Ar
kel, and it was not ashamed to offer M. Rossi
tano a reduction of salary immediately after
he had obtained great success in 'The Hugue
nots,' "La Prophota,' etc. Russitano pre
ferred to leave Madrid. The celebrated artist.
Mme. Pasqua, soon went also, refusing all
overtures for a re-engagement as she whs worn
out with the state of disorder and the scandals
which resulted from the aversion of the pub
lic for an enterprise wittiont management,
without tact and without brains." It may ba
added that Mme. Gabbi and Mme. Arkel are
two of the best dramatic sopranos in Europe:
they would either of them have little diffi
culty in putting into the shade Mme. Lltvinne,
Nordica's successor at the Metropolitan Opera
house. In fact, their voices are younger and
more beautiful than Nordira's. Arkel is a
Jewess of great beauty, and is possessed of
remarkable dramatic ability, and Uabbi is a
Neapolitan, with all the fire and verve of her
race.
Charles Frohman has gone on record as re
fusing admission at his theater to a New York
critic who had bought his tickets. Mr. Froh
man's reason was that the critic is gen
erally acknowledged to be actuated by
euvy, hatred, malice and all unchari
tableness. In Switzerland the question
of whether a person can bo refused ad
mission to a theater has just been brought
before the highest tribunal in tho country,
and the decision there brought the Supervisors
of Geneva into a good deul of trouble. It
seems that a popular singer in light opera had
an admirer, whom she said could call uj>o:i
her occasionally behind the scenes at the
Municipal Theater. The mauaqer did not
dare expostulate, as the singer was very capri
cious and her presence in the cast aiwxrs
caused a sensible increase in the box-office
receipts, but to outsiders he expressed his
opinion that it was a nuisance to have
strangers coming behind the scenes when th c
performance was in progress. These words
came to the admirer's ears, and he imme
diately songht out tho manager, with the re
sult that a quarrel ensued and the manager's
fnce was slapped. He at once complained to
the Municipal Council of the city of Geneva,
which owns the Municipal Theater. The
council forbid the young man entering its
theater, even as a spectator. Believing that
his rights had been infringed the prima
donna's admirer carried the case to the Gov
ernment of the Canton and thence it was
appealed to the Federal Council, which has
rendered a final decision that the Municipal
Council had no right to forbid entrance to any
spectator who was not uoisy and disorderly
during the performance.
The fairy opera entitled "The Royal Chil
dren," by Ethelbert Humperdinck, which has
been anticipated for months past, has just been
played for the first time at the Royal Theater,
Munich. The work was received with such
frantic enthusiasm as to recall the legendary
successes of Richard Wagner's later operas,
which were produced under the patronage ot
his friend and protector, Kins Louis II of
Bavaria. The fortunate composer of "Hansel
and G otel" was present at tho performance of
"The Ruval Children," and was greeted with
acclamations by the audience. It wis what
the Italians call a successonc, and the composer
was called b> fore the curtain almost as often
as if the performance had been taking place
in Naples. The public enthusiasm was aug.
menied by a surprise which the composer had
in store. The programmes announced as the
writer of the libretto a certain Ernest Rosner,
whom no one had ever heard of. The first
t: me he was called before the curtain, Hum
perdlnck presented himself with his poet, who
proved to be a blonde and beauiiful young
woman named Elsa Bernstein. The Munich
press predicts as much success for "The Chil
dren of the King" as "Hansel and Gretel" has
achieved.
Apropos of the hundredth anniversary of
FrÂ»nz Schubert's birth, the musical papers In
Austria, France, Germany and England have
given an interesting flood of anecdotes of the
Viennese master. The following is from Le
Mencsirel: "A hundred yean ago, in the
homo of a poor teacher in Vienno, there was
born one of the musicians wnom Germany has
honored most â Franz Schubert. Tnirty years
after this memorable event, on the 29th of
March, 1827, the city of Vienna was rendering
Us last homage to Ludwig yon Beethoven.
Surrounded by a populace in mourning, the
remains of the composer of the nine sym
phonies had been laid to rest in the cemetery
of Waehrins, ami according to the custom of
the country the musical societies which
formed the escort were returning home to the
strains of a triumphal march to express joy at
the liberation of the dead man's sou), when
Schubert with some companions entered a
Weinhaus. After the glasses had been filled
Schubert named the following toast: 'To the
one Â«ho will follow him first.' Alas! It was
to himself that he drank, for the following
year he died."
People talk of the high prices charged for
grand opera in New York, but the charges at
the Metropolitan ure nothing to the rates
which are being charged at La Scala in Milan
for the first performance of the new bal.et,
"Lo Sport," composed by Manzotti. Orchestra
chairs are 80 francs ($10), $12 is charged for
back seats downstairs, and for the top gallery
which is on the second tier, the prices are $3,
and $2 vxtra for the seat being reserved. As
for boxes, of which the seating capacity of La
Soala is principally composed, they cost a
small fortune. The management is under
heavy expenses, however, for in spite ot the
facithatit is the fashion to sneer at the pau
city of stage appliances in Italy, the Scala
ballets are produced with a magnificence
probably unparalleled on any stage in the
world, and as the ballet follows the regular
performance of the opera it is necessary to
hire two orchestras for the same evening. The
members of the Scala Grand Opera Orchestra,
about a hundred iv number, are all professors'
and would consider themselves degraded if
they played for a ballet d" action.

Franz Schubert left no children, but the de
scendants of his brothers and sisters (he haj
eighteen of them) are very numerous. At thu
time of his death five brothers and two siste*^
were still living. The last survivor waa thej
Rev. Father Andre Schubert, who died in Vi
enna about ten years ago. The other brothers
were for the most part teachers in primary
schools. The eldest, Ferdinand Schubert, witn
whom Franz lived for some time, was director
of the Primary Normal School in Vienna, and
died in 185'J, leaving twenty-six children.
His granddaughter, Mrs. Geistler-Schubert, ii
an excellent planiste. and lives in London.
Most of his grandsons nre officers or professors.
So the name of Schubert is not by any ineaus
extinct.

The Remarkable Scene in Judge Joachimsen's Court When 238 Chinese Were Arraigned Yesterday
for Gambling.
ATTEMPTING TO
CLOG THE COURTS
Hundreds of Chinese Sports
Crowd in on Judge
Joachimsen.
Defendants Refuse Arraignment
and Are Given Jury
Trials.
The Gambers From the Chinese
Quarters Are Taught a L gal
Trick by Their Attorneys.
Poi Loi is the star performer in the
theatrical circles of China. He is a llonry j
Irving or a I'atti in his particular sphere,
and wLen "Little Pete" was alive Loi had
a standing engagement of $1000 a month
to come here and delight the patrons of
his Jackson-street theater.
Well, if Poi Loi had condescended to do
Spartacus, Chimmey Fadden, or any other
play here, he could not have gathered a
greater crowd of ill-smelling heathens
than the police crowded yesterday morn
ing in Judue Joachimsen's court.
There were 23S Chnamen in every stape
of cleanliness and dirt, but principally the
latter.
Per force the court had to order tbe
white people out of thÂ° room, so as to
make place for the Chinamen, and they
sat and stood up to get a view of the bencti,
just as they do at the Chinese theater.
"Make them stop jabbering !" exclaimed
Judue Joaclnmseii. "Stop them from
smokine in court !"
The heathens were so numerous that
they regarded tlie courtroom as one of
their own haunts and did pretty nearly
asiheysawlit until Bailiff Duncan and
his corps of assistants taught them other
wise.
These Chinese were arrested in the high
binder clubs last Saturday night by Chief
Crowley's men, and they were all oil deck
to -tanti trial.
Major Smith and Joseph Coffey. their
attorneys, had all their clients on hand,
and theY declared they would fight the
cases to the bitter end.
Ex-Judge Louderbacfe, employed as spe
cial counsel by Chief Crowley, was ready
to meet them on their own cround?, :ind
in the conflict Judge Joachimsen dolfed
!iis frkuli bonnet and retired, s-ayine:
"You gentlemen can settle this thing
among yourselves. I do not propose to
sit here and listen to your wrangling."
Tne court ordered a recess, but when he
returned at it 3 conclusion ihe attorneys
were no nearer a conclusion than they
were before.
As Attorney Louderback explained it
the law required each defendant to be ar
raigned separately, or else the conviction
would be overruled upon appeal in the
Superior Court.
Major Smith look advantage of this and
demanded that the entire 238 defendants
be heard as one.
As a result only four prisoners were ar
raigned.
They followed the instructions of their
representatives and absolutely refused to
plead either guilty or notgnilty. The
court was then compelled to order the
plea of not euilty to be entered and a
venire of jurors to be called. He in
creased the bail of each defendant to $300.
and the cases were *et for trial next week.
Six:y Chinese who are out on $10 bail
pleaded not guilty, waived jury trial and
avoided tlie anger of the court, but the
others demanded the full reading of the
complaint in English and in Chinese. The
latter method is bound to keep Police
Court '6 clogged up for months in the hear
inp of these particular cases to the exclu
sion of all others.
FAVOEABLE TO THE EAILEOAD.
The Supreme Court's Action In a Suit
for Damnged Trees.
The State Supreme Court has ordered a
new trial in the case of R. W. Tierce
against the Southern Pacific Company.
In February, 1891, Pierce shipped from
Florida to Gulick Bros, at Riverside. Cai.,
two carloads of orange trees. When the
trees reached New Orleans it was found
that the route through Arizona was broken
by washouts caused by severe storms and
the trees were sent by the northern route
through Texas and Colorado to Utah and
tence over the Central Pacific Railroad.
While in transportation over the northern
route the trees were destroyed by freezing.
Pierce brought suit against the Southern
Pacific Company, claiming that by send
ing these perishable trees by the cold
northern route it had violated its contract
and he obtained judgment for $89ti5 dam
ages. Tlie railroad people asked fora new
trial of the cause, wiiioh was denied, and
it was from this that tiie appeal was taken.
The Supreme Court declared that the
lower court erred as to tlie extent of the
naniages and in not permuting the rail
road company to show tlie market value
of orange trues at the point of shipping
and at Riverside.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1897.
DR. JORDAN ANALYZES THE REVIVAL.
"It Is Not an Attack on Religion to Call Crime or Folly by-
Its Name â Revivals cf Hysteria, Sensationalism
and Sensualism Should Receive the
Rebuke They Merit/
President David Starr Jo-dan ofLeland Stanford Jr. University delivered a
lecture last night before the Psychic Society of Oakland. It was especially inter
esting as constituting an explanation of his attitude toward the subject of "Re
vivals." which has recently provoked much controversy. Dr. Jordan originated
the controversy by decrying certain forms of the revival ns beir.g merely a "species
of insanity and "moral drunkenness." This view was warmly except ed to by many
ministers, who have seen the worthy fruits of religious revival?, and Dr. Jordan
accordingly rejoins with a fuller explanation of his objections to tbe so-called
"emotionalism" in certain phases. He said in part:
In what I Khali have to say to-nirht 1 speak not as a preacher, but as a teacher, or rather as a

'1 he ceremonies and customs of man rest on a lasts of truth else they would not endure. Man's
experience justifies them else they would not bÂ«*. sometimes the custom outlasts the need for it.
Imita ion the power of aÂ«soclatlnn. the strength of oreonlztttlon glv<? life to ceremonies long after

nature has bee i misunderstood. lint before we condemn any ceremons- or custom we should study
the. basis on which it rests.
The speaker then referred to the cpremony of confirmation rrcognized in the
r?reat h storic churches of Europe as marking the "putting away of childish
things" by youth. This eenminy has a physiological justification in a desire to
reach out among the contradictory imr>ulÂ«es of co-ordinating nerve cells to
"bring them into nnison and to h'rini: from strtiegline incoherence the firm
purpose of self-devotion and of self-restrain." He continued:
\\ ith all this nriÂ«ps the danger i ha- the ceremony may bo taken for the thinr Itself. It some
times ends in mere formulism, and thus degenerates into Intellectual and spiritual slavery. Many
have learned through sad experience the unreality or mere forms when the life Itself is absent.
i here are many who pass through T.ese forms without reaching the Inner harmony that the forms
are "iippos'-d to represent, and there are many. too. who pass through this stage without the help of
noble associations and without the Impulse that comes frnm the force of a pure life. Not all or our
v nth come within the influence of nobl- teachers, not all arc In touch with th â¢ Ideal ministry.
The influence < f vulgarity, of bad associations, of Impure thoughts, rf cheap emotionalUm, all
these tend to ob cure and destroy the co-ordination of Impulses and purposes which lie at the
busUof the new life.
It wan to reach those who had p^ssrd the period of confirmation without entering upon any form
of the new life that the process of conversion was brought Into play. , his. like the other, was no
new thine. ]â¢ wi mo modern dis o\ ry net rÂ»sts In the n'Â«-dÂ»Of human nature Itself. It was that
of the Individual zallo-i of religionâ Of working out <-n s's own salvation. The Idea of conversion
la Dot thai of confirming In Hie rich: way, tut of turning about the one who is In the wrong way.
To this end every force available baa been brousht to bear. The lonrertba individual Das gone on
the wrong tra-k the more force it re<in res io brine him on the right one. nence the, development
of every inliuence that could come from the presence of numbers, from the power of sons, from
the fear of ihewrat.i to come, from the hopÂ» of a material heaven from the dr-ad of a material
wor dof torment. And the result has been In mnv cases a turning aboutâ not an instantaneous
f ; ! am?Â» of character, for character is the resultant of nmnv actions, but an instantaneous change of
direct. on. .Â»nd this may be permanent or not, necorling to the strength of character of the indi
vidual who Is affected, acco die o the undercurrents already at work and according to the Influ
ences which Inter may be brought Into his lt:e.
Those who bave dealt mos- wisely with t'hfs class of converts are those who have found from
the beginning something Â«or them to do. 1- will iOl do to turn them over to the remorse which de-
roys nor to the mere senlmentnllsm or emo-i.n which ends in nothing. They must be set 10
work. This the Salvation Army well understands
Just as in the phenomena of co iirmatlm there Is a danger of mere formalism, or Inertia, Of
selfishness, of dependence on others, so in the process of conversion we have the danger of sterile
emot on, of wrong emotion excited from time to time, and ending In nothing; or. In extreme
cases, we have the dancer of disturbance of the mental organism Itselfâ thÂ» danger of Insanity.
_ There are many ways In which the normal relation of the parts of the nervous system can be
altered, just as there are many ways In which the tlme-keeplne qualities of a watch may bÂ» de
stroyed. It Is posslb'e for us to alter the nature of the sensations that the brain should receive. It
is posÂ«lb eto deceive th* bruin by Impressions of eternal things that do not exist. Men have long
since leurned to take advantage of thÂ« Tact to nrod-ce in the Drain impressions of appearance
when there is no appearance. This ii the function of alcoholic, stimulants: this is the function of
tea, coffee and other alkaloids that make tig feel well when we nre not well: that give us comfort
in fee ing without comfort in fact. In like manner the Influence of narotlcs tends to subdue
sense Impressions, giving an appearance of rest and quiet which U as false as the feeling of
pleasure which alcohol eÂ»ches. There are other means or producing similar conditions In the
sensory relations of the brain.
The Influence of the excitement or others produces excitement In rou, whether It have a causa
or not. As a frightened horse will stÃmpede a herd, Â«o a frightened man may stampede an army.
In like manner the various derangements which go under the name of hysteria are catching. The
frenzy of mobs passes from man toman, and the whole mass is rilled with the deilre to Kill. In the
same way long-continued solitude produces nervous derangement.
In the re to produce results in the conversion or the wicked men have lenorantly, some
times wickedly, taken udvant.-ce of tiese facts. It Is possible to produce a terrl.le excitement,
wnich is of the nature of lnsnnltv. which bÂ»arÃ no relation to religion and cannot be workei out
Into honlthfu. life. Such evil Influences show themselves in the form of trances, which are sen
sory disturbances In which the brain has fantastic sensations or no sensations at all, or it is filled
with thoughts which are the product* Of the hypnotic suggestion of others.
"JrEV B W1 " may l) 0 pllt !0 s ' e *"P a na there may be evil derangements of the motor ap

All of these are cases of Insanity that have no relation to religionâ that have nothing to do with
a normal conversion or change of life, and tneir effect Is evil and wholly evil.

the offering up of human sacrifices. These ar- no remote dangers fur from our daily lives. They
are ever present when mu.tltudesare gathered together under the influence of strong feeling of any
sort.
It Is true, however, that (here are some who seelc the excitement of religion* Catherines solely
for excitement's sake. These an> rhroritr- cai< s <>X hysteria or catalepsy. It Is Mr. Sankey's testi
mony tht tn>- presence of such people lias b<>en a constant dread in his work, and that in well
ordered revivals some son or police forrÂ« |g necessary to remove theÂ»e people that they may noi do

J ellpi n wo thy of the i ame is an exnressiou,,of the hiÃh^st sanity. Kelicion In one form or
another must be the central axis of a worthy- lie. But mere em< tion wlihout purpoÂ«e of action Is
not re'.i<?ion. Excitement of the nerves for the mere pleasure cf cxc tement tins no eunobllnu influ

tude whi< h shows itself In chronic conversion. When one 'falls from grace" readily lie has not far
total. Vet even these are entitled to gentl* jndsment. They would have fallen further if left to
themselves.
lint I am mvnef too much of a pnrltan to believe that we can safely or rightennslv use religious
emotion as a source or personal pleasure. The happiness of a religions man cimes from the f^et that
be has done his part In the work nf the world. Hint he has followe I his ideals.born â¢ his burdens, and
received the reward which always comes io him who has loved much and has wrought his love into
deeds. The warmth of love know* no chill or Ussitude. Fevers and chills are alike symptoms Of
disÂ«us<\ tt Is certain that chro lc religious excitement is destructive to tho higher life. The great
efforts put forth to save the sinnershould not be used as a means of dissipation for those who be
lieve ihemseives to be saints.
The professor then quoted Edwin DillÂ«r Btarbuck of Clark University, whose
study of conversion as "primarily an unselfing" he eulogiz d. Mr. Starbuck treats
the subject from its broadest point of view, emphasizing the belief that "conver
sion is not a matter for the churches alone. It is under certain conditions a vita!,
moral step in individual urowth. Each step is of frequent occurrence in common
life. It is the birth of the individual, of self, into a larger spiritual world in which
he finds his l:fe. It is the individual will coming in harmony with the divine
will."
After some personal reminiscences Dr. Jordan continued:
The lesson to ns is 'hat one should be temperate in all thing*: that relicion shows itse"f In lofty
ideals steadily followed, in a clean life and in a pure heart. Sterile em 'lions are not rolls-ion, anil
hysteria, of the same nature as drunkenness, may be even more danuerous. because It Is Insidious
and because it may seem to come miner the protection of the honored church.
It Is no attack to protest, agsiiist the abuses which may creep Into religions practice. Every
honest clergyman knows Unit these ex esses exist, and in the d f?ree that he is earnest he'deplores
them, though lie may not see how to avoid them. This is the problem of his life worn, to be help
ful only and not to hurt even the least of the little ones. He cannot, as has been 8Â»ld, "go c Busing
in stage boots through the hoy of hollos." He cannot delegate his duties to itinerant pretenders?

THEY WERE EAGER
TO BE ACTORS
Arthur Sears and His Sis
ter Paid to Be Made
Stars.
They Sue Belasco and Say He
Failed to Make Them His
trionic Artists.
Say They Were Led to B?lieve They
Would Become Great Artists
in Six Months.
One of the most interesting claims filed
for many a clay in the Justices' Court of
San Francisco is that of Arthur Sears and
his sister, Mrs. Nellie E. Covmgton,
against Frederick Belasco, manager of tbe
Alcazar Theater uud of a school of prac
tical acting conducted by him at the Odd
Fellows' building.
The complaint shows that the plaintiffs
have met with sore disappointments in
life withiti the past six months, and they
attribute their reverses of fortune very
largely to Instructor Belasco. They have
employed G. W. Howe, a local attorney,
to set forth their claims in legal form.
"These people give a fair idea of what
we have ;o encounter every day." said
Manager Eelasc?; "peoplejwho expect to
become histrionic marvels In about six
weeks and positive world-beaters in a
year."
The complaints set forth that Belasco
advertiies in the daily papers and else
where â and they show these ads â "his
ability to make proficient actors of pupils
who attend the said school ; that he will
rehearse said pupils un the stag â , and put
them through a course of practical and
eihcient exercises and enable them to ef
fect natural expressions, and to arrive, as
nearly as possible, at complete por
trayal."
These claims raised groat expectations
in the minds of plaintiffs, Sears longing to
abandon the business of painting houses
and yearning for the wide field where he
might portray human emotions. His
sister, too, wearying of the Berkeley hills
and monotony of the workaday "world,
says she was induced to believe that she
would soon arrive at a degree of culture as
an actress that would keep the world busy
guessing bow long she had been on the
stage.
The complaints set forth the aspirants'
grievances in detail. They say the plain
tiffs "were promised that in six months
they would be fuliy qualified and compe
tent actors, so much bo that lie (Belasco)
would defy any old-time actor or theatri
cal professional discovering or detecting
that they had not been full-fledged actors
for a number of years."
The complainants ask for a joint sum
exceeding $500. ea?h allegation of dam
ages being within the statutory limit for
Justices' courts. They allege that the
plaintiffs have been put to creat incoti
veinenoo and trouble in traveling to and
from Berkeley during the period of the
tuition, and that they have awakened to
a painful realization of the fact that they
are not perfect actors, so drilled in decla
mation, gesture, feeling and expression aa
to defy dramatic critics to distinguish
them from the heroes of the stage.
Mr. Sears thinks it would require about
$299 99 to repair the injury done to him
by forcing him to continue the vocation of
painting houses, while his sister thinks
she could stop the heartaches and disap
pointments Inflicted upon her for about
$246. Both have concluded that acting is
au uncertain profession.

PLANS TO PUT
THE IDLE TO WORK
The Proposed Boulevard
May Be Pushed to
Completion.
The "Pingree Plan" May Be
Inaugurated as a More Per
manent Relief Measure.
The Mining Bureau to Ba Cilied Upon
to Set M.-n Up in Placer
Mining.
More plans were suggested for the relief
of the unemployed at the meeting of the
committee of "experts," as the Mayor
called them, held yesterday in his office.
The one directed at immediate relief
was for the building at once of the long
contemplated boulevard through ex-
Mayor Sutro's and the Spring Valley
Water Company's land, connecting with
the park and ocean drive.
The second, directed at more lasting re
sults, for the benefit of married men and
particularly residents, was for the inaug
uration of the "Pingree system" of farm
ing or gardening the unproductive laud
within the City.
The third was a suggestion of Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald â to get those
who can and will to placer mining.
It was distinctly stated that the unem
ployed did not want charity. Mrs. Flint
declared that the people for whose relief
this movement was started avoided the
cilice of ttie Associated Charities because
it was a benevolent institution.
Commissioner Fitzgerald said that there
were Mowoutof employment more worthy
people â mechanics, trauespeople and la-
Dorers â than at any time previously. He
thought the number of unemployed would
reach 10,000. Of the 1800 painters in the
City fully two-thirds vere seeking eru- j
ployment. The same was true of the car- j
penters and other trades. These people
were suffering and were willing to accept
any employment. They were, however,
even in their starving condition, very
loyal, and would not take the places of |
laborers, even if offered. On this prin
ciple, also, they would not labor for less
than $2 per day, as they understood that
was the current rate for such employ
ment, and would not cut under it.
Mr. AY heeler suggested the boulevard
plan of setting these men to work. He
said that Mr. Sutro and the Spring Valley
Company had agreed to give land for the
extension of the boulevard, and he j
thought that $20,0C0 could easily be raised j
for the work, and that, as the improve- |
ment was extremely desirabie, had been
much talked about and vras popular, no
time need be lost.
The boulevard committee, or those sug
gested to compose it, are Con O'Connor,
Harold Wueeler, J. J. McCord, Adolph
Suiro, Herman tfchussler, Daniel Meyer,
James Ccnwell, Judge Frank Kerriean,
A. B. Spreckels and F. W. Dohrmann.
Mayor Phelan himself suggested the
"Pingree plan." He had telegraphed
Governor l'ingree for the latest informa
tion relative to it, and had received reply
that it was contained in his eighth annual
message, which he had placed in the mails
to his address. The plan consisted in se
curing from the owners the right to use
lands that were otherwise unproductive,
and allowing the unemployed to cultivate
them. A large body of land would be
necessary, and that within walking dis
tance of the heart of the town. Carfare
would eat into tbe margin. The plan is
in successful operation in New York, and
Major Winchell said it has practically
solved the problem or the unemployed in
Michigan â Governor Pingree's State.
The names selected to lorm a commit
tee to carry this plan out were Professor
Wickson, Alfred Holman, E. F. Adams
and Corumiss. oner Fitzgerald.
As to the placer mining plan, Commis
sioner Fitzgerald said that no less than
10,000 Chinese were engagfd in the indus
try, and that they sent annually to the
Mint over $300, 000 in gold. It was pro
posed by law to prevent aliens from min
ing on Government lands, upon which
most of the Chinese were engaged. Ha
thought the Mining Bureau would inter

which, in the face of serious reverses, has
rarely been absent from the character of
the true Greek.
"The news created a sensation," said M.
D. Vanaives yesterday, "and some ot the
more excitable have been almost unable to
restrain their feelings. It will stimulate
us in our efforts to assist the mother coun
try in every possible way. The Helienic
fcociety wiil probably lose no time in com
municating the intention of the Greeks
here to Premier Delyannis, but this will
not be doae until our arrancements are
complete. We also expect to hear ;ram
our countrymen all over the Pacitic Coast.
I have j".w received a letter from J. Pros
cos, one of tL>e foremost promoters O[ the
movement in Cincaso. in which he says
ih.it the enthusiasm there is general and
that the majority of his countrymen have
expressed their willingness to form part
of a military company sliou;a the neces
sity arise. The editor of the Atlantis,
lhe only Greek paper in New York and in
America, i^as written to the same t-ffect.
.tie tells me that the fund is increasing
daily. He is a very able man and will
shortly issue his paper daily instead ol
weekly. He estimates that New York
md Chicago together can rai-c an arratii
body of two or three thousand Greeks."
Tne uccomnanyinz portraits show six of
the most acting members of the Hellenic
Society, who are chiefly responsible for
the patriotic movement la this City. Of
these gentlemen C. Demetrak is the pres
ent p resident of the society and both
Xusta ana Vanvales have heid that rion
i.rable office in the past, the latter having
been twice elected. The entire six enjoy
the advantage of military training in the
Greek army and are. therefore, qualified
to engineer a movement of this Kind.
Most of ttiem, too, attained the rank of
officer during their term of service, and
though they do not pretend to say that
they have ever seriously attempted in the
past "to fright the souls of fearful adver
saries." yet if tbe latter chance to be
Turks, they will seek an early opportu
nity of enjoying that distinction.
P. T. Vrettos P. Pandanzes and N. P.
Damlanakis are ail three energetic mem
bers of tho society and are working hard
to insure the success of Sunday's biiique t
and the forthcoming National bah at the
Druids' Hall on Sutter street. In addi
tion to the foregoing, the following gen
tlemen are busily engaged in collating
funds and taking the names of military
volunteers: G. Fundas, A. Pappageor-e,
P. Carvoone*. E. Kocinos, D. Chicures, M.
Bacapulos, P. Papadimos, J. Chrisoverry,
A. Fundas, A. Simacapulo?, P. Ohicures,
J. Bardeles, A. Kinanopulos, J. D. John
son, D. Samios, with many others.
The Hellenic Mutual Benevolent So
ciety, to which all these gentlemen be
long, was organized in 1892 by D. G. Cam
arinos, its first iiresident, with a member
ship of twenty-five, which has since in
creased to 175. It has interested itself in
the Cretan movement from the start and
will raise a separate fund amonir it* own
members in addition to outside subscrip
tions and the receipts realized from the
forthcorcinu banquet ;<.nd ball.

Lieutenunt-Commander Turner of the

extent of three drinks. He made a bet
that he was the "youngest native son that

Both of the latter gentlemen Could Drove

cause the beaten men did not like to be
beaten, and it was finally decided that
Captain Turner was not a native sou.
According to Captains yon Schmidt and

DIED AWAY PEOM HOME
Miss Maurer'n F ital Visit to the Ha-
iraiiau 1Â«'.;i..<l .
There was a sad scene on Pacific-street
wharf yesterday. Hundreds of people were
down to meet their friends, and among
them was a lather, who looked from face
to face of those grouped a;ong the railing,
in the hopes that he would .Â«ee a loved
one. His disappointment was g>-eat when
no familiar form appeared, and he got
angry with the customs officer when the
order was given to kpep off the gangway.
Burning with impatience be fumed and
(retted, but later on he learned tint his
daughter was aooard but in her coffin.
During her holiday trip the young
woman had died, and all that came back
to the expectant father na< the corpse.
Fred Maurer is the father o! the young
lady, and it was he who swooned nway
yesterday when he saw a cofiin insteud oi
his daughter. MisÂ»s Maurer left here with
her aunt for a holiday in Hawaii last
month. While away she was taken with
some throat trouble ancJ, in spite of all
the can- that could be given her, she died.
Her holiday was up and the Australia
was to have brought her home yesterday.
Instead death stepped in and the father
received the body only. The spirit had
flown.

LONDON COIN FOR
MARIPOSA MINES
An English Syndicate Buys
Land of Alvinza
Hayward.
One-Sixth of Historic Mariposa
Grant Goes to For
eigners.
First Actual Transfer of the Prop
erty in M^ny Yearsâ sl66,666 2 3
the Price.
Alvinza Hayward has sold to an Eng
lish syndicate a one-sixth interest in the
celebrated Mariposa grant.
The sale was consummated Monday.
The amount paid was $1/',G.6G6 G6%, which
would indicate that the whole estate, con
trary to numerous wild guesses hazarded
by newspapers during the last decade, is
estimated by one of its owners to be worth
not more than $1,000,000.
This is the first actual sale that has been
made of any of the property since 1887,
notwithstanding repeated rumors of trans
fers for larc;e sums of money.
The California Exploration Company is
the pnrcbaser. Its representative, H.
Bratnober, consummated the deal. He is
the man who for the same company
bought the weil-known Elfchorn mine
that proved a vuritable bonanza to the
London investors, while it brought Brat
nober prominently before the public as a
promoter of mining.
This introduction of Enplish capital into
California is considered significant by Mr.
Hayward. He remarked last ni^ht that
lie thinks it aupurs well for the State. It
may be only a beginning on the part of
London capitalists seekine mining invest
ments here.
The Muriposa grant has an interesting
his'ory. The property itself includes
about 45,000 acres of mineral, timber and
â  agricultural land. About ei^ht mile 3of
| the famous "mother lode" runs through
lit. There is abundance of water for mo
tive power. Durine the old mining days
the Aqua Fria, the Josephine, tho Pine
Tree, the Mexicnn, the Princeton, the
j Mount Ophir, the Mariposa and other
I mines were worked out upon the grant by
I imperfect methods then in use.
General John C. Fremont, "the Path
finder of tlie llocKy fountains," was the
original owner by virtue of a grant mndf
to him by the old Spanish Government of
California. He developed several mines.
1 The Aqua Fria, the firsr gold mine sold
ab r oad, he disposed ot to Lundon capital
ists, who in 1851 put up a six-stamp mill
on the property. In 1872 Fremont, em
t>arrusseci financially, sold the grant to
Eucene Kelly & Co. of New York, and
they spent a fortune during years of liti-
I gation before they cleared up the title to
I tnp grant.
Next the grant was sold to n California
syndicate consisting of Atvinzn Hay ward,
John W. ilackay, W. S. Hobart, J. L.
l\ooÂ»l nnd J. P. Jones. The Flood inter
est has sinco bten absorbed by the other
owner*, who now control the property
jointly with the London syndicate that
has just bought in.
BOBBEEY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL
Four Young Ladies .Lose Small Sums of
Money.
Email sums ol money, ranging from 25
cents to $1 25, were stolen last Monday
from the satchels of four junior pupils
attending the Girls' High School, come%
of Scott and Geary streets.
The young ladies reported the loss of
their money to the principal, Eliaha
Brooks, on Tuesday morning. They
stated that they had left their satchels,
containing their purses, in an empty
classroom and returned to find the purses
missinu'. Mr. Brooks say* he feels pretty
sure the petty theit was committed by
one of the pupils. "Amon>:sso scholars,"
he said, "there ennnot tail to be a tew
clack sheep." He proposes to lay a trap
for the culprit, but hardly expects to suc
ceed. Much the same tiling Happened a
year ago and a detective was called in,
but he could do nothing.

Late News From Chicago Seems

Professional Racing an! Racers Form
a Potent Factor in the Con

in Albany, N. Y.
The delegates from this jurisdiction,
Chief Consul Frank H. Kerrigan and R.

tional body by a vote of 161 against 77,
and this is what stirred up considerable
feeling in the breasts of the wheelmen in
this City.
There is much talk of secession from the
league, and this reason is among those ad
vanced:
Professional riders are debarred from
membership in the league, and ye: are
made subject to its rules. This they con
sider is unfair. Although they have
yieided obedience to those rules, still they
are ready to revolt, and consider this an
opportune time to agitnte their grievance
in the hope that by a split they may come
in for batter terms.
California having two divisions â the
northern and the southern â is unfortu
nately divided in itself on the iocal option
question, as can be seen by the following
resolution :
At a regular meeting of the Board ot Officers
of the South California Division, L. A. W.,
held December 9. 1896, the following resolu
tion whs unanimously adopted :
Resolved, That it be the sense of this Board
of tne South California Division, L. A. W., that
the leacue do not grant divisions the option
ot Sunday racing, and that our delegate to the
National Assembly be so instructed. Also
that this resolution be published iv the official
organ.
This action on the part of the south was
considered by the San Francisco clubs to
be unfortunate, aa it divided the State
vote and encouraged the opponents of
Sunday racing.
Nothing positive will bÂ« dona by the
local clubs, however, until the return of
Delegates Kerrigan and Welch, after
which a division counc 1 will be called and
a consensus of opinion of the delegates
sought in favor of seceding, with a proba
bility of forming a Western League, which
wil! be independent of the East. This
idea has trained strength by the action of
the professional riders in Chicago who have
started a boycott on the league meet which
i* to be held in Philadelphia in August.
From this it is thought that a rival league
with the interests of the professionals at
heart is likfcly to be the result.

â¢awaited a formal motion to go into com
: mittee of the whole. But this was not
. ;t 6- ba. '
â¢:. '"I -would like to ask," said Dr. Clinton,
. '/if.the Spring Valley Water Company has
: yet filed in the office of this board its an
.â¢'"swers-to the questions asked them on the
..:3d. inst by letter from the chairman of the
'â¢Water Comrair.ee. I refer to the detailed
.-statement?"
' â¢ "Mr. Clerk," said the Mayor, "has such
â¢ a statement been furnished?"
.7 'No reports have been filed by the com
.. pany except the reports received at the
last meeting," replied Clert Russell. "I
cc-mmunicated with them alter the last
â¢.meeting in accordance with the instruc
tions of the board."
.'.'Dr. Clintonâ Has the company a repre
sentative here to furnish us with that in
formation ?
â¢ VWp.ara furnishing that information
.'irgni tixe to time as you require it," said
Mr. Kellogg. "I did not suppose you
could, take it at any one session."
â¢ "A request was made," said Mayor
.Phelan, "for a written itemized detailed
statement as to stock and bonds and the
.roster of the company's employes, their
duties and compensation."
"- "I understood," rejoined Mr. Kellogg,
"that the motion with regard to that was
. postponed until this evening. We filed
' aH that was possible under the circum-
. â¢stances."'
. ... The clerk was instructed to read the
Wa*er. Committee's communication of
: ' t.'io 3d in--t.
. ."â¢Now," resumed Dr. Clinton when that
Ceremony was over, "I want to know if
â¢'â  t/wft information is available.''
â¢Â£,-."A. portion is," said Mr. Kellogg.
â¢ > .'here will be enough information to
"â '. co.py the entire session."
â¢; o Dr. Clinton â I contend that in order to
â¢ ii'x;the rates intelligently this board re
.. quirts a.detailed written answer to these
â¢ .question?. The company has bad amp.
.time' to comply with our request. I say it
'. w-ilHall due respect to the company that
"its,\p'olicy is one of evasion and not one of
strict honesty. There is no disposition on
â¢ 1 r t:e art of members of this board to im
"'r.ose'hardship upon the Spring Valley
Water Works. We want to be just to
â  "thjem and to our own consciences. I say
.that in the absence of this informa
tion this board is not prepared to
] r.oceed wiih this investigation, and since
the' company has failed to comply with
the-law, fail.cd to comply with our demand
.' â bur legal demand â for this information,
" "we; are compelled to adopt other means
oigetting at it. I therefore move that
-t.n.is board be empowered to employ if
-.necessary an expert accountant to expert
' the 1 . .books of the Spring Valley Writer
â  'Worse?, and also that the s-ame power be
given to the board to employ if necessary
.an expert engineer or corps of engineers
to investigate and examine and report
â  cpQ-n the present condition of the works;
t;-je sources of supply and the daily supply
fpouv.said sources by gravitation; the
. ampufH of water that can be supplied by
. -pumping; the condition and valuation of
t::e primping works, and such other in
. rmafion as we may require. I offer that
â¢as a motion. 1 '
'â  "I rise," cried Dr. Rottanzi, "to a point
â¢ order. I believe it is impossible to pro
â¢ ceÂ«d in such a manner. The law states
"â¢that all information must be given by
â¢statements signed by the president and
â fr<eretar.v, and that we must deal mirania
. t; y with them otherwise." Here Dr. Rot
t;u â¢ took up a bulky volume lrom a pile
â¢ i^l'icnt of him, and, turning to the legis
. lanlXe act of Marc i 2, 1881, he quoted
the- -provision,' which sets forth that
-. -fuy Board of Supervisors failinc to ob
â â â¢ :Ve us duties as described by this act
; shall -be guilty of malfeasance in office.
"' 1 -Hie com parry," he continued, "must give
'â¢ us these .detailed statements. If they do
. iiÂ«; they are euilty of a misdemeanor, ac
cording to another section in this very ar
ticle.' i think that we should proceed
with this.investigation and find out every
" thing, and if they do not comply with our
" wishes; we must deal with them summa
rily, according to law."
â¢ "It- doee not fellow," said Dr. Clinton,
!'t)ia,t if this information is supplied we
â¢ must.accept it, and for that reason I have
ft\&ed for power to employ these expert?."
â¢"I second the motion," said Dr. Dodge,
. briefly.'
â¢ ''Supervisor Rottanzi has made a point
â¢ b-f 'order,*. 1 observed the Mayor, who then
quo'eo. the section empowering the board
â¢to fix. the water rates annually. "Your
contention, doctor, is," he continued,
.."'baa in the event of the company failing
' ' to lurnish the statements required by law
your only remedy is to prosecute them for
â¢misdemeanor?"
"That," replied Rottanzi, "is what I
consider to be our duty."
. "I know just as well as Dr. Rottanz ; ,"
â¢ said Dr. Clinton, "that the company has
â¢ notr o.mpjied with the strict letter of the
lavr"* As I understand ft the last Board of
Supervisors requested this information to
be given in detail. They have absolutely
â¢ failed to do that. I have been waiting as
chairman of the committee to receive this
information. Should we have the j-resi
d.ent-of the company arrested for misde
meanor, and should they then be corn
pelted to supply the information, it does
.notfpllow that we will accept it. I merely (
want power to be given us to employ ex
perts."
"Do you claim," asked the Mayor, turn
ing to Mr. Kello<re\ "that the statement
j supplied the last day of January is a full
I statement, as required by law?"
Mr. Kellogg â It is in compliance with
i section 2 of the act of 1881. We are pre
| pared to-night with the stocks and bonds
! business requested at the last nieetine.
Tne Mayor again looked up the law on
the subject and asked: "Do you contend
; that yonr statement is sucli a statement?"
Mr. Kellogg said it was.
"That," resumed the Mayor, referring;
to the legal enactment, '"is the statement
required bylaw, gentlemen, the company
having had thirty days' notice, and tbia
is the statement they have rendered us in
compliance with the law. Th* interroga
tories sent to the company the other day
are merely the board's interpretation of
what an itemized statement is, and there
is a question now on that very point. Do
you, Dr. Ciinton, persist in your motion ?"'
"I certainly dc," replied that gentle
man. "Inasmuch as the company has
failed ud to tde present to â¢ive us the in
formation a<ked on the 3d inst., I move
that we proceed by other means to get
j that Information, and la furtherance of
i that object 1 move that the board be cm
i powered to employ an expert accountant
Ito expert the books of ihe company. 1
i would move later that we adjourn to meet
i again at the call oi tne chairman of the
; committee."
Dr. Rotianzi thought that the investi-
I cation should not cease now, but that
they should try to obtain all the facts and
; proceed in such a manner as to deal justly
: with their constituents.
"I rule," said the Mayor, "that your
; point is not well taken, because Dr. Clin
ton does not suggest tbe abandonment of
j the investigation at all."
Supervisor Britt rose at this juncture.
"1 do not like," he began in stentorian
tone?, "to be accused of ominous silence,
especially when an important question
i lite this is involved. 1 do not propose to
be guided by the judgment of those who
have Â»or.c over the question in gome dark
] room. I want to learn some good reasons
' and arguments why at this particular time
t:;ere is any necessity for the motion
, offered bythe gentleman from the Eleventh
! Ward. Do 1 understand the representatives
i of the company refused to give the In*
' formation we bare asked of them? I cer
, tainly did not so understand it. If they
are expected to supply us with statements
; to be digested in one night I am opposed
for one to any such action. I have been
interested in the statements made and
the questions asked and 1 feel that the
board up to this time has not gone into
the question fully enough to justify it in
taking any such action. I feel tbaj; the
investigation, should po on this evening
the same as last night. Let us sea if we
can glean something and get borne in
formation.
"Theie ar> soran members of the board
who have not had an opiortunity to go
into all the questions raised be.ore the
committee. Ido not like to be accused of
| not being for fair play, even if I have to
: stand op in my seat ami make the re
marKs I do. I love fair play and have
been broueht Dp : raong people who liked
to give everybody a cliauce. I say tliat at
l least for this evening we should contmus
' as we have and if we find that these gen
' tlenien are not wiilins to give the infor
! matiou desired, then I will favor the
â  motion offered by the gentleman from the
Eleventh Ward. But up to this time I
â  feel that we would not be justified in view
I of what has transpired in taking any such
action.
"I have myself thought that this proba
! bly would be the only intelligent way to
arrive at this question. I believe that
possibly it may be necessary for us to
c elect a corps of engineers, to employ ex
| pert?, if necessary, so that this cfuestion
n:ay be cone into carefully. But I beiieve
> that to-night we should at least hear what
i information these gentlemen have to give.
Question them as before, and then if we
tind tnat their answers are not satis rac
i tory and that there is a desire on their
â¢ part to hide information we can take
| the course suggested. But thi3 should
| not be done in the face of what
| transpired at the last meetingâ the
j answers given and tne completion of
the proceedings, wherein the Supervisor
from the Seventh Ward (Dr. Rottauzi)
withdrew that portion of his motion re
ferring to an itemized statement of tbe
wages paid by the company. The board
then adjourned, with the understanding
| that certain information would be fur
nished here. We have corue here to get
that information, and I claim that this
I action is not the proper action to take at
I this time. I have been r ading a good
I deal in the papers about the silence of the
j board and what others had to say, but I
j contend, and I challenge contradiction,
that 1 stand here to-niglit making these
remarks independently ol any suggestions
from any man on earth."
Dr. Rottanzi argued that the condition
of the finances at the present time did not
j justify such an expenditure as would be
: entailed by the motion. If necessary, the
board mifjiit go to that expense, but until
forced to do so he thought it should not
do so, but give the question further con
sideration before the boari itself.
"I second this motion," said Dr. Dodge
again, "because I feel possibly that I have
bÂ«en identified with the spirit of it, and
without understanding the references
made by the member from the Ninth
Ward to back-room caucuses ana uews
paper articles.
"I have taken the stand that it would be
wise to obtain expert counsel to advise
with the board, inasmuch as we are twelve
men inexperienced in the matter and be
cause I am not satisfied with the results
obtained during the last two sessions. I
tlunk the investigation will belong drawn
out if we proceed in this manner. Why
there shouM be any objection to tne ap
pointment of an expert to determine from
his standpoint the cost of the works and
other questions I cannot understand."
Dr. Dodge added that he he-Id in his hand
a pamphlet coniaining extracts from the
proceedings of the board in fixing water
rates in 1894, Â«nd among these extracts
was tbe report of J. F. I'ope, an expert.
This report, which the speaker quoted,
was of a tenor eminently favorable to the
company, and the speaker presumed that
If the present board could obtain a report
of tbe same nature it might have great
weight in helping to decide tbe question.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1897.
He contended that the question of
expense involved should not, at
this stage of the proceedings, enter
into their calculations; they mu^t
be provided with the necessary facilities,
and as tbe results up to date had not
justified the expenditure of time he was
strongly in favor of making these ap
pointments, and in fact suggested them to
Dr. Clinton before tbe first meeting. He
thought that some of the remarks of the
last speaker had cast aspersions on the
motives of the doctor which were not
warranted by the facts.
"What aspersions have I cast upon the
doctor. 1 would like to know?" queried
Rottanzi. "I think I have spent as much
time as any member in going into this
question. I have, in fact, consumed a
little of the midnight oil. If other mem
bers would rely upon the information con
tained in these books (indicating a formi
dable pile before him) they would be
better informed and would not require an
expert."
Supervisor Britt corrected the last
speaker and assured him that Dr. Dodge
referred to him, Britt. He disclaimed any
intention of casting aspersions upon any
body. He fimply desired the board to
act intelligently.
Dr. Clintonâ l wish to say that the mo
tion is to employ experts if necessary. It
does not say we shall employ them.
Supervisor Brut â I did not so under
stand it. Is that so. Mr. Clerk?
Dr. Rottanzi â If necessary, it would be
entirely satisfactory to me.
The official stenographer being appealed
to, he confirmed Dr. Clinton's assertion,
and in the absence of any further objec
tion the motion was carried.
Dr. Ciinton then moved that the board
adjourn to meet on Tuesday at 2:30 o'clock,
with the understanding that the investi
gation would be continued on Tuesday
evening at 7:30, Monday being a legal
holiday.
Dr. Kottanzi opposed the adjournment
as before.
Dr. Clinton said he was just as anxious
as anybody to continue the investigation,
but urged that he want d something tan
cible upon which to base it.
He strongly objected to a roaring farce
of this kind. The committee had simply
made itself a laughinz stock. These ques
tions were comprehensive and took in the
entire situation. If the company would
only meet the board in the same spirit,
act honestly, and give tha statement re
quired the inquiry would be completed in
a few more sessions. When the committee
met next Tuesday he wanted something
definite to act upon. He deprecated the
continuance of happy-go-lucky methods
of investigation.
The motion to adjourn carried on the
following division: Ayes â Supervisors
Devany. Haskins, Dslany, Sieehan, Britt,
Dodee, Lackman, Clinton, Kivers â 9.
Noesâ Supervisors Rottanzi, Morton,
Smithâ 3.
Supervisor Rivers then moved that the
City and County Attorney be consulted as
to whether this investigation must be
completed within the month of February,
and whether the rates could be legally
fixed after that date. The motion was
carried.
Thecierkwas instructed to notify the
company's officers to be present on Tues
day evening at 7:30 o'clock with papers
and books. m
The board then adjourned.
PETALUMA MEET POSTPONED.
Poor lioads May Prevent the 25-Mile
liuie Monday.
The San Leandro triangle is in iiicri
poor condition owinc to the recenVr"ains
that the racing committee of the associ
ated clubs is thinking of postponing tbe
big 25-mile road race scheduled for Wash
ington's birthday until Sunday, the 28th
inst. If it rains between now and Monday
this will be done. There are ninety-eigbt
entries for the rece, more than ever before,
and the handicaps will be completed by
Official Handicapper Smyth to-day.
The proposed State circuit will not start
at Petaluma on Monday, as intended. The
track there is not yet in good shape, so
Santa Rosa will open the circuit with a
meet on Saturday, the 27th, and the Peta
luma meet will be held some time in
March.
There will be a big amateur meet at
Fresno next Monday on the new track
l tie re.
The entries for the Velodrome rnceÂ« next
Monday include fourteen professional and
twenty-two amateur riders. The postpone
ment of the Petaluma rn-et leaves no
counter attraction for the afternoon and
the Velodrome should draw a large crowd.
R. C. Lennie returned from the Chicago
show yesterday. He say* it was the great
est snow of cycies ever held, but believes
there will be no more National shows, tde
manufacturers preferring local exhibitions
instead.
D. G. Sbafer. trainer and manager of the
professionals now quartered at t^an JoÂ«e,
is in town. He expects Michael, the
Welsh champion, said to be the fastest
rider in the world, here in about a we-k.
R. M. Welsh and F. H. Kerrigan, Cali
fornia delegates to the National Conven
tion of the League of American Wheelmen,
are expected to return trom the East Satur
day or Sunday. The wheelmen are anx
iously awaiting them to learn full particu
lars of the convention and the reasons
why tbe Snnday racing amendment was
snowed under.
PATRICK DOLAN IS DEAD.

Patrick Dolan, who was shot by "Barney,
the Cook," died yesterday morning at the
City Receiving Hospital.
Eugene Kenney, the man who sur
rendered himself as the party wanted by
the police, was charged with murder on a
complaint sworn to in Judge Joacbimson's
court.
The prisoner has been acting in a queer
wav, and it is believed that Captain
Robinson in charge of tbe police station
will nave to send him to the padded cells
of tbe Receiving Hospital and thence be
fore the Insanity Commissioners.
A formal commitment of Kenney was
â¢worn to before Warrant Clark Drury
yesterday and the prisoner was duly
booked on a charge of murder.
An autopsy was held on tbe body by
Dr. Moreau of tbe Morgue last evening.
It was found that the bullet producing
the fatal wound entered tbe body about
two inches above the left nipple, ranged
downward, puncturing tbe lung and
lacerating the apex of the heart. Con
sidering thn nature of the wound, tbe
physician thinks it remarkable that
Doian lived as long as he did after re
ceiving the wound.
Charles Marne't Kttate.
Judge coffey yesterday dismissed the con
test of the will of the late Cnarlei Maynr,
alim Merzbach, on the ground that the con
testants have not shown sufficient grounds
for a continuance. It is understood that a
compromise witb the claimants had been ar
ranged.

Old-fashioned German customs pre
vailed, and the bridal purty enterei tlie
edifice after the fashion of the Fatherland.
First came the ushers, two by two â
Charles Duisenberg and E 1 ward Duisen
berg, C. T. RylÂ«in<l and Hubert Davis,
Clarence Cooke and Dr. E, B:irry.
Then walkrd the officiating clergyman,

The bridesmaids, walking in double
file â Miss Augusta Dulsenberg and Miss
Clara Isenberg, Miss Elsa Frank and
M<ss Louise Sunsman, Miss Aimee

the bridal procession.
After the church ceremony there was a

THE FIGHT IS OFF.
J. Stelzaer Is Sick and Will
Not Meet Jeffries on Mon
day Evening.
Billy Smith Will Not Meet Peppers
Unless a Forfeit Is Posted on
the Diy of the Fight.
The new California Athletic Club has
strnck a very hard snae and unless it
carries a wonderful streak of luck its
first pugilistic venture wiil not prove the
successful undertaking the directors had
anticipated a few weeks ago.
Yesterday Jack Stelzner left his train
ing quarters at the Br. George Club and
reported to Director LÂ°ak that, owing to
injury which he recently sustained, hi
could not meet Jeffries on Monday even
ing. One of the physicians who exÂ«
amined Stelzner last evening reported

that the pugilist was Buffering to some ex
tent from a blistered back, caused by
iodine which was applied by Dr. Griswold
the club's physician, and that Stelzner
may not be altogether in first-class form
to meet bis appointment on the evening
of the fight.
Jeffries was notified, and he came in
from his training quarters at the Six-mile
House yesterday afternoon. The Loa
Angeles champion felt very much put out,
as he was very confident of winning; the
match. He is of the opinion that Stelz
ner either exhibited the white iea;her or
that the club had had some agreement
with Stelzner whereby it could crawl out
of putting up the purse before the fight
took place. The club tried hard to fill in
the gap by matching Jeffries and Alex
Gregga,ins for a friendly sparrnu' match of
four rounds, but Jiff ries objected to this
proposition by statin?: that he was a
fighter ana not an exhibition boxer. The
directors offered $300 for the bout, which
amount was scorned by the heavy
weights.
Billy Smith also came in from his train
ing quarters and demanded of the club a
certain sura of money or otherwise he
would not meet Peppers on Monday nieht.
This matter was settled by Director Leak
promising Smith that he wouid depos.t
on Monday enough money in the hands
of some responsible person as a euarantee
of good faith on behalf of the club.
Smith Said in the presence oi several
peopie that if the money was not posted
at the hour stated that he would not fight
on Monday night.
The outlook certainly do-Â»s not appear
promising ior the e'ub. The Jeffries and
Stelzner right is off, and it is not certain
that thÂ« Smith and Peppers contest will
take place either. It is sll a question of
money between the pugilists and the di
rectors or the club.
Doubtless Jeffries will depart for Carson
i:i ihe early part of rext week, where he
may appear with Corbett in an exhibition
contest. Dr. Leak said last night that
everything wouid be settled all right by
Monday and that a good show will be
given, even though the fight between
Jeffries- and Stelzner is declared off. Dr.
Rogers examined Stelzner late last even
inc and handed tne directors of the club
/his opinion, which is ns follows:
Sam Francisco, Feb. 17. 1897.
This is to certify that I have made a careful
examination of Jack Steizncr and pronounce
him in no condition to enter any contest for
at least fourteen days from this date.

most active stocks, irregularity was thÂ» chlel |
characteristic of speculation at the opening, but j
subsequently the market showed a tendency to
improve, the result of a sharp rise in Tobacco. i

The reports of fresh' coin petition and realizations ]

stated that the company had not provided as vet i

j receipts of cattle to-dar were unusually heavy,
I about 17,000. head as compared with 12,700 last
Wednesday and 1O,!-H1 a year ago. This brings
the supply for the first half of the week up to 35,-
I 000 head against nearly the sÂ»me number for the
corresponding period last week, and 39,000 a year
I aÂ«o. Tra Is was lacking In activity, and the lib

10($15c per linn lred pouu is. The receipts of hogs

against 33,452 a week ago. Ho?s are being

Miss Cameron's Brother recon

He Lived One Day.

908 Broadway, Feb. 17. f
The hasty marriage of Miss Effie Cam
eron to Frank Richardson has resulted
more pleasantly even than was antici
pated by the principals and their rela
tives. The knowledge that his younger
sister wa? about to enter a married life
which gives promise of being a happy one
brouebt her eider orother to a sense of his
duty and resulte.l in a reconciliation be
tween him and bis young wite, whom he
deserted one day after their wedding, less
than a year ago.
j The history of the Camerons is full of
| romances. About two years aco it was
announced tiiat the eirls had been made
the heiresses of a rich uncle living in
Canada and thai soon they would be in
possession of their fortune. When this
MRS. FRANK RICHARDSON (Formerly Eliic Cameron), Whose
Marriage at a Revival Led to a Reconciliation Between
Her Brother and His Wife, With Whom He Only Lived
One Day.
nÂ°w3 was circulated the credit of the
Camerons was rated very high, and Mrs.
Cameron furnished a tine mansion in
East Oakland, and when the fortune came
not the furniture-dealer resorted to the
courts to recover his property.
A little time after this incident Elwood
Cameron met Miss Lottie Gunther, to
whom he was attracted partly from sym
pathy. Miss Gunther came into notice by
being found in an unconscious condition
on her mother's grave at Mountain View
Cemetery. An empty poison bottle was
lound by her side and she staied upon re
covery that she had been led to attempt
suicide because of the death of her mother
and the unkindness of her father.
Soon after this she was engaged to El
wood Cameron, but he was still under
ace when in March of last year he secured
his mother's consent to marry. The day
after the wedding he deserted his young
wife, and for a long time he resided in
East Oakland and she has been ssay.p^ at
the Chabot Home.
Elwood OniiToa never went near his
wiie until the night prior to the death of
their little child, which occurred a few
â weeks ago. Even under those conditions
the /oung pecple were not complpteiy
reconciled, but last nij;ht when they at
tended together the wedding in the ve-try
the old affection was rekindled, and El
wood took the initiative in bringing about
a perfect reconciliation. He has a home
in East Oakland, and it is very probable
that in a few days they will occupy it to
gether.

Comrade Hyde Says Lyon

G A R
Simuel W. Backus S ys the Opposi
tion to the Dibble Bill Is Un
worthy cf Notice.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Boadway, Feb. 17. )
The old soldiers of Oakland have an in
teresting fight on their bands. Nearly
all of them have gone on record as being
opposed to the Dibble bill transferring the
Yountville Home to tne State. At a
meeting of the Army and Navy Republi
can League Jast Sunday nearly all the
members voted in favor of a resolution
condemning the bill, or, rather, certain
feaures oi it.
To-day, however, the veterans got a big
surprise by learning tdat one of their
number, ex-As^emblyl^an Marcus D.
Hyde of Oakland, has written Senator
Stratton urging him to support the bill,
as it represents the feeling of 95 per cent
of t.e people of the State. Senator Strat
ton has also received a letter from ex-
Posimaster Backus of San Francisco, in
which he says:
I notice by the papers that disgruntled and
disaffected Grand Army men have held a
meeting in Oakland and entered their protest
against the passage by the Legislature of the
to-called Dibble bill, transferring the Veter
ans' Home property at Youutville to the State.
They I em only to oppose certain features of
the bill as being unconstitutional, but the real
opposition is because certain men are named
as d rectors. Tnls is only a continuation of
the factious opposition which certain men
have been fomenting for over a year past and
is nut worthy of serious consideration.
The ores til board of directors are named in
the bill to serve as the first board under the
Dibble bilL Some of these names seem to be
objectionable to some of ouc Grand Army men,
especially in Oakland.
I have ventured to write you this communi
cation, believing that representations would
be made to you from some of your Oakland
constituents, and I wi-hed to assure you that
in my judgment the bill is proper and ought
to pass.
Marcus D. Hyde has aroused intense
feelings of bitterness among inur.y com
rades in this city by the following para
graph in his letter to S.nator Stratton:
Iv Oakland }'esterday there was a meeting,
ha>tily calltd. a; which there were some sixty
or seventy present. A committee was ap
pointed to go to p.-.cramento lur the puruose of
amending the bill. That meeting was com
posed intinly of the same persons who have
fur sever*! yean persistently worked against
the directors oi the home.
In the reports of the meeting it is set forth
that it was not the work oi Lyon I'ost. While
t..at is true, sti:l it is also true that it was
mainly the members of that post that consti
tuted the attemlnucd, and ma of the best
men we nave in Oakland knew nothing about
ti:e meeting, the notices being sent out on
Sunday morning for a meeting at 2 ml of the
same day. â¢â 
It has been decided to retaliate on Mr.
Hyde. The members of the G. A. R. Post
in this city have secured Mr. Hyde's
record from Washington, and they say It
plainly shows that he is not en'itled to
cail himself a member of the G. A. R.
The War Department has forwarded a
statement that Mr. Hyde did not jo.n the
Government service until six monihs after
the time which would qualify him for
memkerstjip. More than this, they hold
Mr. Hyde's application for membership,
which they dec. are is dated six months
prior to the time at which he entered the
navy as a midshipman.
.Municipal politics also cut a figure in
tais row among the veterans. About two
weeks ago the Army and Navy League ex
pelle t Comrade Inwall becou-e he at
tended a convention at which D.tvie was
nominated. inwalTs only defender was
Marcus D. Hyde, and there was more than
a hint thrown out that if Mr. Hyde said
anything further against the Republican
nominee, Comrade Thomas, his fate would
be similar to that of his friena Inwall.
This many-sided controversy is keeping
the old soldiers busy, and through it all
is seen the bitterness engendered by the
suspension of Lyon Post last May.
RAIDING DISEASED COWS.
Berkeley's H alth 0 fic?r Makes
a Startling Discovery at the
West End.
He Lhs in Wait in a Sw?mp for
Twenty-S x Hours to Take a
Law-tr akirg Butcher.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 17. â Health
Officer Roweil has started a vicorous cru
sade against the butchering of diseased
cattle and the selling of impure milk. He
says he no longer intends to have tne peo
ple of Berkeley subjected to the riak of
contracting typhoid fevor and kindred
maladies by butchers and milkmen, who
foist upon them unclean and unwhole
some meat ana milk.
Suspecting that a certain We-t Berke
ley butcher was killing diseased cattle for
the market Dr. Roweil and Deputy Mar
shal Rawson lay in wait for twenty-six
hours in the svcfirup at the West End,
when finally they captured their man in
the act of killing a slck cow. Of his ex
ploit and of what he intends to do with
similar cases Dr. Roweil has the following
to say for publication :
Monday we were informed that a resident of
Berkeley had sold to Frank Glascr of ttiu
Go. den 'West market a budly diseased cow.
Officer Rawson was detailed by Marshal Lloyd
io assist in the case, and together we com
menced a watch or tho animal to be deliv
ered, which we were informed would be aoue
under the cover ol the dark, fchortly after
dark we were rewarded by seeing the cow led
into the barnyard In the rear oi Glaser's resi
dence and where it is alleged he is accustomed
to slaughter auimals within a few feet of h.s
neighbor's bedroom window. Alter havl .g
waited in the vlcluity until naif-past 4 the
following day we observed him slip into his
barn aud begin to butcher, at which time we
made our presence known and watched th
process. He admitted that he intended offer
ing It for sale.
The condition of this cow was simply
nauseaiin .â¢. The liver was freely s ioued w th
large tubercular masses; the glands were
brouen down; the .unus had undergone a
cheesy degeneration so that ttie animal
breathed with only a small portion of one of
them; in lact she was as nearly dead as Is
possible to imagine and still be able to stand.
This morning Glaser was arrested and ap
peared before Judge Gentry, where he pleaded
guilty to a eh irge of butchering the nniiual,
aud alter paying the immense fine of $15 wÂ«s
given his liberty.
This cow to be sure is disposed of and de-
Htroyed. but a man can make money and still
pay an occasional fine of this amount. Wo are
not desirous of persecuting any one, but we
shall vigorouiv prosecute these people who
are poison ue their patrons by inches. Kunher
mor* butchers aud milkmen alike daily volua
teer their assistance in running down some of
these scamps who are ruining legitimate
business.
, Juniors Are Victorious.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 17. â The
juniors at ttie State University added an
other victory to their lonÂ« list of suc
cesses on track, endiron and field to-day
by defeating the R'jphoruores in the tinal
o. the class contests on the diamond by a
score of 9 106. This victory entitles the
juniors to play the dental colle c teÂ«m for
tlie championship of the university and
the Mlver cup. They will meet next
Saturday atiernoon on the Berkeley
diamond. The game to-day was charac
ter d by the almost equality o: the
work on both sides, and it was not until
the ins: inning that the '93 men were
certain of victory. The heavy mud on the
fie. a prevented g>od base-running, and
rendered the outneld work most d lticult.

BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 17.â The water
Companies' representatives had a lively
time for two or three hours last night with
the Board of Town Tru tees. The ques
tion at issue was the high rates lor water
which the people of Berkeley claim they
are being required to pay.
It was the general sense of the meeting
that the people of Berkeley are paying
very dear for their water. A- stated in
The Call a plank has been inserted in the
local Republican p.'atlorru deprecating the
high tariff and standing for a reduction.

preparat ons r.re being made for ttie uni
versity cotillon, which will take place next
Tuesday â¢ vening at Harmon Gymnasium.
Preparations are even more elaborate than
those of last season and the affair gives
promise of being the social function of the

YOUNG WIFE IN TROUBLE.
Once Arrested for Lunacy and Now for
l>i.Â«: in bance.
HAYWARDS, Cal., Feb. 17.â Much in
tereH has been caused all day by the trial
of Mrs. Munuel Garcia for disturbing the
peace of Joseph Souza. Tne defendant is
the enild wife of Manuel Garcia, She is
15 years of age and has been married more
than a year.
Two weeks ago the child cheated a sen
sation by reporting to the Sheriff that her
husband bad murdered their little baby
ana had hidden it in the hills. A search
was made and the fact was established
that a child had never been born to them
and that it was only ihe hallucination o!
the girl. Because of her belief, Mrs. Gar
cia, it was stated, attempted to kill her
husband, but on promising to behave
hersell in the future she was released.
A lew days later the eirl wife went to
the house of Souza, where her husband
was stopping, and, it is alleeed. created a
disturbance. The District Attorney's of
fice whs assisted by Attorneys Langun
and Lemos, and Judge Lamson of San
Leandro defended.
The whole day was consumed in testi
mony and argument t.efore the jury. The
caÂ«e was bitterly fought on both sides and
did not get to the jury till about 7 o'cl< ck
to-night. An hour later they returned a
verdict of not guilty. The courtroom was
packed, and when she was acquitted they
cheered loudly.
Manuei Garcia stands highly in local
Portuguese society, and from the number
of witnesses against his young w^fe she is
evidently unpopular, but :rom the jury's
view unpopularity i 3 not a crime.
THE CROWD YELLED "PAKE"
An AllÂ«-gpd Prlzr-Fight In Plenaanton
Which . esulted in a Fiasco.
PLEASANTON, Cal.. Feb. 17. â A
crowd ot 200 sports, including one China
man, assembled in a large tent back of the
Rose Hotel to-night to witness a ten-round
sparrin.: exhibition between Charles
Turner, the colored middle-weight, of
California, and W. A. Nicholas, who hails
from Minnesota. The rip.iters were billed
to box for a pur*e of $800, but it is more
than likely that the winner will count ties
in leaving town.
Prior to the main event Billy Johns and
John Merchant of Livermore had a four
round set-to, which, by the way, showed
their utter lack of knowledge of the manly
art. The exhibition pleased the crowd,
however, as hard hitting constituted ti.eir
exhibition. Jack Sharkey and Mart
O'Brien fougnt three hard rounds, the
former navin" the best o. the argument.
At 11 P. M. Turn r appeared in i he ring,
hi-, seconds being Jim Ryan, who lately
fought Tracey in the Eas , and Billy Duke.
A lew minutes later Nicholas appeared,
with Biiiv Armstrong and J. Murpbey as
seconds. W. T. O'Donnell of San Fran
cisco was selected referee. The following
records the farce:
First roundâ Both sparred the whole round.
Turner landed two easy blows, one on ribs,
one in f ee.
Round 'Zâ Turner did all the leading, only
three light blows being struck.
R. und 3â Turner hit Nicholas under the eye,
draulne first blood. No other b.ows struck.
K<'Uud 4â No blows struck.
Kounci sâ Turuer looked at Nicholas, and the
Ui.tr leu to the ground und was counted out.
The crowd yelled fake and dispersed,
vowing vengeance on such miserable
fakers, and regretting the price oÂ» admis
sion which they paid to see the affair.
Sunday-Closing to i:.< Submitted.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 17.â The City
Council met io-night and passed the reso
lution authorizing the City Clerk to place
on the official ballot the question of Sun
day-closing. The discuss. on was a lively
one and ex-Judge Havens represented
those who favored closing. Several votes
were taken on t c proposition in various
â¢>i npes, and at one time the vote was in
favor of submitting the question of totally
closing the saloons. Then a compromise
was agreed upon and the Sunday-closing
proposition passed.
The submission of the question has no
executive significance and will merely in
dicate popular sentiment by which the
next council can act or not according as
it sees tit.
Water t'atei.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 17.â The City
Council p-iss il for tne first time the ordi

tion of about 80 per cent from the rates
mat were in vogue three years aco.
At the Oakland.
OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 17.â The old war
drama "Blue and Gray" is having a fine
run at the Oakland this week. The pres
encr of a large company of the National
Guard is a very realistic addition to the
cast, which is very clever. The anima o
scope between the acts is a popular inno-
I ration.

Litt'e Hope That the Harbo

Senator White Also Asked to Help in
Trying to Prevent Work

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
'JOS B roau way, Feb. 171 )
The Board of Trade has not yet received
a reply from Mr. Hilborn re^ardin^ its
proffer of help in connection with getting
the harbor appropriation included in the
pending bill.
In view of the fact that the sundry civil
bill passed the House yesterday il is con
sidered doubtful if anything can be done
at thi> session, as tho present administra
tion is avowedly anxious to go out of
office leaving behind a record for economy.
Surprise was expressed to-day when it
became known that Colonel Suter had
quietly departed for Washington. Some
members of the committee anxious to
secure his aid in preventing the stoppage
of harbor work made the discovery that
the colonel had not been at his office for a
day or two an<l had gone to Washington.
Nothing could be learned definitely re
garding the purport of his mission, but in
view of the circumstances it is surmised
that t c has been called by the War De
partment to straighten out the tangle
which has arisen over the harbor matter.
As it is known that Colonel Suter does
not favor the ideas advocated by Dr. Mc-
Lean of Alameda it is hoped that his tes
timony may have some weight in restor
ing the appropriations to the sundry civil
bill before it goes to the Senate.
Yesterday afternoon the iollowing tele
gram was sent to Senator Perkins:
Oakland, Cal., Feb. 16.
Senator Gforgt C. Perkins. United States Senate,
Washington, D. C: Failure to secure appro
jviauou an 1 immediate continuance of har
bor improvement will cause vital damage to
our commercial interests. Oakland depends
on your best effort, and trusts it will be suc
cessful. Oakland Board of Tkade,
By James P. Taylor, President.
The co-operation of Senator White was
also sought in the following dispatch:
Oakland, Cal., Feb. 16.
Scnatnr Stephen At. White, United States Senate,

ance of dredging of its harbor.
Oakland Board of Trade,
By James P. Taylor, President.
Although every effort is being made to
prevent such a disaster as the complete
cessation of work on the harbor those
most interested hold out very little hope
of nccornplisning anything till the next
session of Coneress.
MAJORS ON WATER RATES
Finds the Valuation Excrsslve and
Thinks the City Could Use the
Power for Other Things.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 17.â The state
ment made public that the water rates for
the ensuing year would be fixed by the
Board of Trustees at the same figure as at
present brings forth a lengthy criticism
from Green Majors. He claims Mr.
Thompson did not comply with the law
in not giving an itemized statement of
expenditures and receipts of past years.
He then continues:
According to his statements on file, for the
years 1891 and 1896 inclusive, he shows net
'â rifiis lor the six years, a total of about $189,
--802 48. Rflliabie authority has shown thai a
water piant capable of furnishing Alameda
w.th 1.000,000 gallon-, of water per day
(which is, 1 be.ieve, nearly twice as much as
tne city now uses) can be put in, complete,
with an allowance of three mi es of pipe line
to connect tne ciiy with a distant supply, for
irom $200,000 to $250,000. Mr. Thompson's
works are not worth 1 cent more than it
wouid cost to put in a plant now that would
be amp.c for Aiameda for years to come.
Allowing, then, that Mr. Thompson's water
works are worth the $250,000 it would cost to
complete a mlllion-gaiu.n-a-day plant, and
allowing him ti per cent a year on his invest
ment, which is more than one man In twenty
is making th-'se hard times, the rate for fami
lies In Alameda for 1897 should not be over
20 cents per 1000 gallons, or just a third less
than it seems uur Trustees have concluded to
allow him.
My position is either right or wrong. If It Is
right (and I firmly believe it is) no one could
claim an injustice has been worked either to
Mr. Thomp son or the public. Kigut wrongs
noboiiy. A wrongwrongs all concerned.
In ih:s connection I can't forbear su. gestinjj
that if this city owned her municipal utilities
the s'une plai.t could pump tne water, lurnish
electric lights and also the power tor running
the streetcars. Such an arrangement is not
so far (ff as some might imagine. Municipal
owuersh.p is agitating Calii<rnia, the United
StHt. sâ the world. Progressive AJameda will
not remain in the rear rank* of such a grand
economic lorwara movement.

INDIANA AUCTIO.V COMPANY.
H. J. LEUTHOLTZ. Auctioneer.
IS PAID FOR TWO JOBS.
Robert L. Maun an Example of
the Meth ds of Rainey
Polit'cs.
Is au Assistant Prosecuting Attorney
and a Teacher in the Rich
mond Schorl.
The ways of Rainey politics are devious.
Under the regime the stable boss has in
augurated at the City Hall Robert L.
Mann finda himself on the municipal pay
roll in two different departments.
Mann is at present one of the assistant
prosecuting attorneys in the Police courts.
He was a member of the Democratic cam
paign committee, and for his services to
the party the stable boss promised him a
seat at the pie c inner. Mann was slated
for a $250 a month job as one of the Police
Court prosecuting attorneys, but when
the time to deliver the goods arrived
affairs were so complicated that he was
obliged to accept a place as an assistant at
a saiary of $125 a month.
Mann is also an employe of the School
Department. He is a teacher in the Rich
mond night school, or to be more specific,
he is the whole school, ami for instruct
ing the youn of that neighborhood once
cr twice a week he receives a salary of $30.
The Grand Jury may be asked to investi
gate how it i* that a City employe can
hold two public positions and receive two
salar.e.-) in violation of the law.
Mann had offices previous to his ap
pointment to an office in the police courts
with Congressman Maguire. His friend
ship and admiration for Rainey has al
ways been marked; so much so that the
big boss some weeks ago he.d a caucus in
Maguire's office, much to tbe surprise and
chagrin ol the Con. res^man's friends.
A CHILD'S PLAINT.
She Charges That Thomas Dillon and
His Wife Conspire to Defraud Her
of Her 910,000 Patrimony.
Catherine J. Brown, a minor, by her
guardian and attorney, Donzel Stoney,
has tiled a suit against Thomas
Dillon and Bridget Dillon, bis wife,
for the recovery of a piece of land on
First street, near tne corner of Mission
street, in this City, valued at $10,000,
which Mr. and Mrs. Dillon are alleged to
unlawfully bold from the plaint. ff.
The complaiiits set forth that Mathew
F. Brown, the father of the plaintiff in
this suit, died in this City on the 31st of
December, 18'J4, and that on the day of his
death and immediately before his death
he signed a document, purporting to be a
deed oi conveyance of the premises men
tioned to said Bridget DUlon, and that the
deed was recorded oa the 2d of January,
1895.
The dead man's younp daughter al
leges that at the time of the signing of the
purported deed ber father was not of
sound mind, and that he was mentally in
competent ;o sign that deed or any deed.
Miss Brown charges that the pretended
deed was procured by means of ihe undue
influence and fraud of Mr. and Mrs.
Dillon ; that her father had been t-ick witn.
consumption for a long time and was at
death's door at the time of the s gning;
that from the moment of the si ning and
until the moment of his death he wa-, by
reason of bis sickness and weakened con
dition, extremely susceptible to the influ
ence and aitinces of designing persons,
including the defendants herein named;
that these defendants, recognizing his ex
treme susceptibility to their influence and
artifices, conceived the design and intent
to influence and control him in the dispo
sition of his property to their advantage
and to the prejudice of his minor daugn
ter; that with this intent; tney prepared
the deed in question and compelled him
to write his name at the end of the docu
ment, though tbey knew it did not con
form to his wishes.
Miss Brown complains that this pre
tended deed constitutes an unnatural
and inequitable disposition of he? father's
property; that he had always been a kind
and nfft-ctionate father to her and mindful
of her welfare, but by this purported deed
the whole of his estate with the exception
of $700 was attempted to be conveyed,
thus making no provision for tue support
and maintenance of his child, the plaintiff
in this suit.
Mi!>9 Brown asks that the deed be can
celed and that she be adjudged the owner
of the $10,000 worth of real estate.
THE HOLSTEOM BABY.
She Is liikely to Become the Object of
1 wo suits.
Another phase of the struggle for the
custody of little Effie R. N. Holstrom is
about to be enacted, as Mrs. Sarah d'Arte
nay, the mother of the girl, has tiled an
application to be appointed guardian of
her own child.
The litigation in regard to tbis matter
has attracted much attent on in the public
press on account of the unusual circum
stances attending the case. The child was
born out of wedlock, and the mother, then
known as Sally MoGuire, executed a so
called Dill of sale of the infant when it was
Â«ii days olil to Mrs. Lucinda Holstrom for
the sura of $10. Mrs. Holstrom neglected
to lepally auoui the eh Id, and some lime
ago Officer Frank J. Kane look forcible
possession of the little one and tle.ivered
it 10 its mother, who took it to Woodland,
in this State. Mr. Holstrom, husband of
the child's foster-mother, learned of the
hiding-place of Mr 3. d'Artenay and went
to W> odland, and by strategy and lorce
regained the custody of tiie child.
Now boih mother- have filed petitions
for the care and custody of the little pirl,
and each alleges that the other i.s an unfit
person to have the custody of a minor.
The case will come up for hearing in
Judge Coffey's department of ihe Supe
rior Court on the 24th of the present
month.

PLEASE RETRACT,
SAID C. W. BUCK
He Made This Rr quest
Yesterday of the Board
cf Health.
This Resulted in Naming a Com
mittee to Afford Him
Satisfaction.
Then Letters Concerning County
Hospital Patients' Money Were
S;nt to the Grani Jury.
Charles W. Buck, rice-president and
general agent of the Helvetia Milk Con
densing Company, appeared before the
Board of Health at a meeting held yester
day and made a demand that some re
dress should be offered for wrong which
be said bad been done to the company
with wnich he is identified. Mr. Buck
appeared to be very angry. The grievance
of which he complained consisted in the
publication of a certain analysis submit
ted to the board by W. T. Wentzell,
chemist, of Highland Evaporated Cream,
which is manufactured by Mr. Buck's
company.
The report was submitted by the chem
ist some days ago, and was published in
several daiiy papers. Mr. Buck saw the
report, and vi3iied the otlice of the Board
of Healto, Miii also called on the
cnemist in his laboratory on the top floor
of the City llu.l. Somewhat heated in
terviews are reported 10 have taken place.
Mr. Buck said something about suits at
law and went away.
According to Mr. Buck's statement the
chemist insisted that nis analysis was cor
rect. Mr. Buck hotly disputed ibis. Ttie
routine proceedings of the board had
been completed yesterday, and the execu
tive session was- impending, when Mr.
Buck rose to ask permission to say a lew
words. In his band he held the monthly
report of the Board of Health for Janu
ary.
This pamphlet contained a report from
Chemist Wen Hell, but the analysis of the
Highland Evaporated Cream differed very
materially from the one originally re
ceived from the chemist and given pub
licity in the jiaperg.
Mr. Buck called attention to this. The
original report was that the Highland
Evaporated Cream contained 5.75 per cent
of butier fat. The figures published in
the board's monthly report were B.SB per
cent. These latter figures Mr. Buck was
not disposed to dispute very vigorously.
although he remarked that the Highland
Evaporated Cream really contains 9 per
cent of butter fat.
But he said injury had been done by thÂ«
publication on the 4 a Lost, of the 5.75
per cent rating. Prizes had been given ail
over tne world to the cream, gold medals
and so on. The report hid been made
tbat the company extracts the butter fat,
but this, he said, wa-j not the ;act. He
had reports and ;;:.vits from noted
chemists, including Professor Hilgard.
"The { riming ot your report," said Mr.
Buck, "Las done us raucu harm. You
virtually Fay in your printed report that
the analysis previously made is untrue.
It baa, however, gone broadcast, and it is
a very serious matter. Tlie report as it
now stands ia virtually all right, and you
do not now say that we extract the butier
faÂ«."
Dr. Filz.^ibbon at once moved that the
matter be referred to the Food Committee,
which consists of Dr. Morse. Mr. Buck
found out wi;o the committee was and de
parted with the understanding that a reso
lution will be prepared for adoption which
shall undo, as much as possible, the effect
Of the chemist's first report, for publica
tion.
In executive session another important
matter came up. This was the report of
Dr. Hart and W. D. Griffin concerning the
City and County Hospital, which it was
voted to transmit to Mayor Phelan and to
the Grand Jury. This report dealt with
the sdministration by Dr. Stable of the
affairs of the City and County Hospital,
including the destination ot certain car
pets purchased for the hospital, etc. This
was accompanied by a supplemental re-
T'orf. by Dr. William on, which it was
voted to forward to the Grand Jury alone
with letters and correspondence relating
to the moneys of patients remaining in
the hospital during the incumbency of Dr.
Stable. This allusion 10 the moneys of
patients is a new feature of the scandal
connected with the hospital.
Dr. Williamson reported that the fund
for hospital purposes is too small, and
that at the end oi the fiscal year it will be
greatly overdrawn.
Paul E 1 wants, steward of the City and
County Hospital, reported an insufficient
nupj'ly of cooking utensils, ward furniture
and bed c'othinjr.
Dr. Fitzgibbons reported the unsanitary
condition of the premises at 686 Brannan
street, occupied by the San Francisco Con
diment Company.
Dr. Morse reported tbat surgical instru
ments are needed at once at the .Receiving
Hospital. Dr. Morse repor:ed also that
tlie Butchers' Board of Trade ha- been in
duced to withdraw all objections to the
measure to confer upon the Board of
Health power to pass ordinances. The
following ordinance, recommended by Dr.
Morse for submission to the Board of
Supervisors for adoption, was approved:
The people of the City and County of San
Francisco do ordain as fallows:
Section 1. It -hail be unlawful for any per
fon or persona owning or employed in any
laundry 111 tlu City ana County of San Fran
cifco to s; ray the clothing of any person or
persons with water that has first been placed
in the mouth of said owner or employe.
Sec. 2. Any person violHtinc any ol the pro
visions of this ordinance shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be pi;n
lsi ed by a fine not exceeding $50, or by im
prisonment in the County Jail for not more
than o.e month, or by both such fine and im
prison
Dr. Williamson made a report concern
ing proposed legislation at Sacramento to
abolish the position of quarantine,
which he has opposed. Dr. Lovelace
made his monthly report 01 vital statis
tics for the month of January. There
were 613 :eaths, and in the correspond mr
month of last year there were only 493.
Ths principal causes and the number of
deaths resulting therefrom were as fol
lows: Apoplexy 27, general debility 34,
bronchitis 29, cancer 35, diphtheria 8,
typhoid fever 13. heart disease 72, con
sumption 87, pneumonia 67.
Dr. Lovelace's recommendation, that
Health Inspector G. S. Millard should be
dismissed, was postponed, a communica
tion asking for delay having been received
from Mayor Phelan.
On motion of Dr Williamson it was de
cided to permit children who have been
afflicted with measles to return to school
alter the expiration of fifteen days from
the date of their recovery. Heretofore
the limit has been thirty days.
The appointment by Dr. Spencer of An
dre Deesousslavy on the 16;h inst. as a
helper in the bacteriological department,
at a salary of $25 per month, was ap
proved.
Some resolutions adopted by the State
Labor Convention protesting against able
bodied inmates of the Almshonse and
County Hospital being allowed to perform
mechanical labor abont those institutions
without the usual pay fixed by the labor
unions were read andrefcrreJ to the Board
of Supervisor?.
Held fur Manslaughter.
The preliminary examination of William
McLeod, ship's calker, charged with the mur
der ot his wife in their residence on Couland
avenue, was concluded before Judge conlan
yesterday. The Judge heid McLeod to anÂ«wer
before the Suierior Court on the charge of
manslaughter, and fixed his bonds at $5000.

SCALES LIKE A FISH
Terrible Condition of a Baby from
a Scaly Skin Humor.
Our baby boy was born July 1,1894. In the
fall his legs became rougb, from some skin
trouble, from his knees down to his toes, also
his arms, breast, and abdomen. We tried a
great many different kinds of remedies, but
without success. In the summer of 1890 it be-
came a little better, but in the fall, and all win-
ter, it was a sight to behold. lie had scales
on his body and arms like a fish, and almost
â  black. In "fact we were ashamed with it, but
could not help it. We were almost in despair
until we had used Cuticuka Remedies for
about four days, when we noticed an im-
provement. Every time my wife washed him,
ncr apron became covered with a scale-like
skin. To-day it is gone, his skin is as smooth
as any child, and we owe it. with the blessings
of God, to Outicura Remedies. If you can
use this testimony, we give our full consent.

been confined on board the Liffey for steal
ing a ring. At Victoria Conway and Col
lins, whose terms had expired, left the
ship, and lost sight of Ashe.
At the City Prison Conway and Butler
recogn:zed each other immediately, and
they talked for some time. To Conway
it is understood Butler outlined his pro
posed defense when lie is tried in Aus
tralia, and also his reasons for now being
known as Weller.
Con way has toll his friends that Ashe
made tins statement. He liad a mining
claim in the Blue Mountains, but had no
capital to work it, consequently he adver
tised in the Sydney papers for a com
panion with some means. Captain Lee
Weller responded, he said, and agreed to
join him.
On the day of teller's death Butler
said he had left the place where the mine
was located, and on his return he
found toe di>:ui body of Weller in the hole
which he had been dis^ins?.
He said he was "thunderstruck" at this
discovery and for a time did r.ot know
what to do. To return to Svdiiey and re
port the death of his late companion
would create suspicion of iiis being the
murderer, and as lie Dad no way of dis
proving this he decided to cover the body
up and >;et out of the country the
best and quickest way lie could. Conse
quently lie Â«-a:d he maae his way to New
castle and shipped on the Swanhilda un
der the name Lee Weller, thinking that
should any inquiry be made for Weller
the conclusion would be arrived at that be
had shipped and left the .colonies, thus
averting any investigation as to what had
become of him. The carrying away of
tlie effects of Weller, he continued, was a
part of the plan, so nothing could be
found belonging to the victim that rnigtu
in any way lead to an inquiry as to his
whereabouts.
This, it is understood, will be Butler's
defense when plaied on trial in Sydney.

LOUIS SLOSS SIGNED IT.
A Check That Paid for Rich
Jewish Lore for Berke
ley.
The Semitic library of the State Univer
sity received a valuable addition yester
! day in the form of a collection of Hebrew
works, which will be known es the Sloss
! collection, from the fact that the donor
; was Louis Sloss.
Ttie library mentioned was started some
time ago when Alfred GreenDaum pre
sented the university with 10C0 valuable
works of Semitic literature which he had
collected at great expense.
A few weeks ago Rabbi Voorsanger, who
is tne professor of Semitic languages at
the State institution of learning, was
calleo. upon by a collector of Hebrew
works who offered hi-t library for sale.
The rabbi, whose ambition Is to see a com
-s>lete reference library of the Sgmitic lan
guages in ttie possession of the university,
selected 1000 volumes which he said would
be of great value to ihe students under his
rharue, and Mr. Sloss, who is alÂ«o much
: interested in the future of t he university,
â applied the check that paid lor them.
llii! purchase price is, in deference to
'.he wishes oi Mr. Sioss, kept secret for the
; present, but it is said to be very large,
i thouch far less than ihe actual value of
the works.
The 2'KX) volumes that have thus been
j obtained are but the nucleus oi a full
i reference library which Rabbi Voorsanuer
i bopei to place within the walls of the
i university.
A collector of Semitic literature who re
j cently visited this City sold him ll>oo rare
i volumes, which will be added to the
I present library, making: about a third of
what will constitute the full collection.
I The books that will arrive from the
Eftst in :i few days contain many valuable
i manuscripts In bynae, Arublcand Hebrew.
I One of the most interesting is a copy of
| the first edition of the Talmu.i that was
I ever turned out of a printing press.
Rabbi Voorsanjjer is on the lookout for
loiher works that will be useful at the
! university, and will add them to the col
lect m,h as fast as they can be obtained.
When ths rabbi took hold of ttie depart
j ment of which he is the head ho had but
five pupils, but since then his class has
increased to twelve, and interest in the
languages of the Semitic races is con
stantly advancing. Those who attend his
classes are not theological students, but
are members of the various departments
I of the university.

WEEP, ALL YE
SPORTSMEN
Barney Farley's Historic
Training Quarters
Are Sold.
THEIR FAME SUNG FOR
MANY A DECADE.
Record of the Life of a Man
Well Known All Over
the Country.
DEMP3EY'3 BLACKTHORN AND
M'AULIFFL'3 PARROT.
Farley's Renowned R zor F atâ No
Man Ever Turned Away Frcm
His Door.
Barney Farley's will soon be no more.
That historic roadside resort and train
ing place where for many a long year
sporting men have been wont to gather
and discuss, the great events of the pugil
istic isrena, both past ami future, this
week will pass into other hands.
From tbe walls look down the portraits
of many champions of the roped arena,
their eyes seemingly tilled with a dumb,
hopeless protest at the departure of the
famous old man who has so tenderly
watched over them for so long. Even the
inscriptions of great events with which
the corners of the great rooms are rilled
already grow almost indistinct under the
spiders' webs, foi in the hurry of prepara
tion for his departure Barney has neglect
ed such things as applying the broom and
duster to the walls formerly so clean.
The old fellow ptoud in the group yes
terday and in subdued tones talked of his
life at "Fariey's resort." His eyes were
set on the western heavens, where the
sun was just sinking in a glow of red
light, and if Dempsey or McAuliffe, men
to whom his name is almust a synonym
for lather, could have seen him then,
their hearts would hurdly have been as
light as when they emerged from the
ring after a gladiatorial triumph.
"Yes, boys," tald Barney, "'I have Deen
here now since ISW. In thai time my
house has sheltered many a man whose
name has been on the National tongue.
"Now, there's Jack Dempsey, as game a
man as ever stepped into the ring. See
that cane over there in the corner? Well,
that piece of blackthorn was the last gift
the good-hearted fellow ever made to a
man in San Francisco. But now he's no
more.
"Then there's Jack McAuliffe, and Jack
is one of the famous trio of Sullivan,
Dernpsey and McAuliffe, who held the
championship in their cla-scs lor so Jon?.
Look at that bird there," and Barney
turned to point toward a parrot indus
triously screeching, 'Any old thing goes
with me. 1 That is McAoliffc'a parrot.
He left it here l i â¢ 1 he sent for it."
Yes, there's many a man w<U read the
news of Barney's g- ing out of business at
the old stand with feelings akin to sadness.
Choynski and i'itzsimmons, "Brooklyn"
Jimmy Carroll aiid Joe Goddard. "Austral
inn" Billy Smith and Patsy Kerriean,
Johnny Murphy and B.lly Savage, Solly
"Yes," said Barney Farley, "this place is filled with historic
associations. That blackthorn is Jack Dempsey's gift; that parrot
belongs to Jack McAuliffe."
Smith and "Sailor" Brownâ to them the
name of Farley is a watchword and the
sight of bis roadside mort as the glimpse
ot home.
It is not financial troubles tbatembarrass
the veteran trainer. Not at all. Bat his fam-
D]T is well depleted by death and marriage
and the old scenes are to him a constant
reminder of the days gone by. 80 he in
tends to move to "scenes and pastures
new," where he may partially forget the
inroads upon his domestic happiness.
Already the Kale has been completed
and later in the week Barney will move to
new quarters on Market street, where he
expects to have a lucrative income by the
sale of his tonic and his exercising ma
cliine, both of wnich are well known in
the sporting world.
Barney Farley himself is a character o{
renown. Born in Tallystown, County
Westmeath, Ireland, in 1840. he early de
veloped a thirst for adventure and at the
age of 10 years came to Boston. From
there he went to "Woonsocket, R. 1., where
he entered a wholesale liquor-store. In a
short time he became the owner of a race
track and many celebrated pitcesof horse
flesh. Deerfoot, the celebrated Penobscot
Indian runner, first gained renown upon
Farley's track.
It was at Woonsocket also that Farley
first gained fame as an athlete. Deerfoot
used to run ten miles in an hour on his
trial spins, and Barney came into promi
nence as the only man around who could
keep up with him for a couple of miles.
As a handball player he also grew to be
an expert.
In Wisconsin in 1863, Farley himself did
ten miles in an hour and one minute.
Prior to ao doing, he had not run any race
for nearly a year.
In 18G4 Barney came to California. His
fame was by this time widely heralded by
his battle with Tommy Chandler, with
whom he fouuht nineteen rounds, scoring
lirst biood. He was finally knocked out,
owing to his weakness from heavy train
ing shortly preceding the mill.
On coming here he went into business
with Joe Windrow, a famous trainer of
lignters In early days and also for some
time an Olympic Club processor of boxing.
When he located in his present historic
quarters the hr*t man of prowess to use
his place as a training-station was "Val
paraiso" Keilly.
Though nearly 57 years of age Barney ia
still hale and hearty and can penorin
feats of strength and skill that would non
plus many a man far younger. Some of
his thrilling feats, including the widely
I talked of razor jump, were recorded in a
! former issue of The Call some months
ago.
In fact, the veteran's activity and good
health are ample testimonial" to his state
ment that he never took five drinks of
whisky or beer in his life. His only bev
j erage is novv and then a glass of sherry
wine. In a man of his environment and
association this ij wonderful. Until a
year and a half ago he used to average
, thirty cigars a day, but at that time he
I became convinced that their use was
detrimental to his health and ceased
smoking entirely.
It is said of old Barney that a more
honorable and truf-hearted sporting man
never lived. He was often imposed upon
simply because he iound it so hard to be
lieve evil of others.
No man, it is stated on good authority,
was ever refused succor at his hands, and
no man was ever sent from his door in a
besotted condition. He knew when a mail
had imbibed enougn and would sell him
no more.
A TOURIST ROBBED.
He WaÂ» ltelieved of Hi* Diamond Pin
by a Young AVoiuhii.
A wealthy tourist from St. Louis, who is
a guest at the Palace Hotel, is mourning
the loss of a valuable diamond pin and
several detectives are trying to nnd it for
him.
Early last Sunday morning he was walk
ing along Market street when be met a
young woman. SSiie accosted him, aid
after talking for a few minutes she left
him and he went to In? room in the Pal
ace, when he missed his diamond pin and
concluded at once tnat the young woman
had stolen it.
The police were notified and last night
Lizzie Murphy, a consort ot Mike Nolan,
who was arrested recently for shooting at v
saloon-keeper on Grant avenue and at Po
liceman Owens, was arrested last night on
suspicion of stealing the pin. The tourist,
whose name the police refuse to divulpe,
will have an opportunity of identifying
her to-day.

ASSAILED A GIRL
IN THE MISSION
Louise Greninger Attacked
at Night by a
Ruffian.
She Was on Her Way to Her
Home on Kansas Street,
Near Â£even:eenth.
He Attempted to D) Serious Harm,
bat Her Screams Brought People
to Her Assistance.
A gross assault was attempted upon a
young Â»;irl Tuesday evening^by a ruffian
who nas not yet been captured by the po
lice although evtry effort is being made in
that direction.
Theodore Greninger, who Hves at 524
Kansas street, near Seventeenth, and his
daughter Louise. 17 years of age, left home
about hulf-nast 7 o'clock Tuesday night to
do some shopping.
They went to a shoeslore on Sixteenth
street, between Howard ana Mission, and
purchased a pair of shoes. Tne lather
went to the grocery on the corner of Six
teenth and Mission streets and the girl
said she would walk home alone.
She walked along Howard street to
Seventeenth, and south oa Seventeenth
on her way home. It was dark, ihe moon
not yet havin* shown her face; but the girl
had often walked home alone, and was
not in ttie least afraid.
As >--he readied a point between Potrero
avenue an:l Florida street, which is a lone
some place, few houses being in the lo
cality, a man grabbed her unexpectedly
from uenind and threw her to the side
walk. He fold her not to make a naise or
he would choke her. Then he attempted
other violence, and, notwithstanding his
threats, the girl screamed loudly for
help and struggled fiercely to get out of
trie gra>p of the ruth'un.
After the girl was almost exhausted
from her struggle* her screams were
fortunately heard by some people in the
neighborhood, and when the rurlian heard
them coming he released his hold ot the
g:rl and disappeared in the darkness.
Sh? was escorted I orne and her nerves
were so severely shaken with the encoun
ter that stie was forced to retire-to bed.
Wnen her father reached home and heard
of the gross outrage upon his daughter he
was furious and hurried to the Seven
teenth-street station.
Lieutenant Burke heard his story and
sent Policemen Aniier>on and Rearuon to
get a description of the man irom Miss
Greuinger, but she was too ill to talk to
them.
They saw her again yesterday, but she
could only describe him as a short stout
man about 30 years of age and roughly
dressed. The officers learned from people
in the neighborhood that a man about 30
years of age, smootn face, about 5 feet 4
inches tail, big black eyes, and wearing a
fiat biack hat and yf-liowish brown sack
coat was seen hovering around shortly
before the girl was assailed, and the police
expect to be able to identify him as they
believe he is not a stranjrer to the locality.
CLEARING BENSON.
Twelve Case* Dismissed in the I'nited
State* District Court Yesterday.
Several of the cases, civil and criminal,
againÂ«t John A. Benson, who was indicted
by the United States Grand Jury for fraud
ulent surveys while under contract with
the United Â£iate9 to do Government work
in California and Nevada, were dismissed
in the United States District Court yester
day.
This action was taken on orders from
the Attorney-General, many of the mat
ters at issue having been satisfactorily ad
justed.
Assistant United States Attorney
Knight, who appeared for the Government,
objected to the dismissal of some of the
eas^s claimed by Benson's attorneys to
have been settled on the ground that the
orders from Washington made no refer
ence to them. These will be settled at a
future date if the necessary proofs of com
pletion are produced.
In nil six civil and six criminal cases
were dismissed.
For Ii ili.V-; Starving Teople.
The India famine relief fund soliciting com
mittee of the San Francisco Chamber ol Com
merce, nÂ«w assured by Congress of a 3500
--ton steamship In which to transport grain to
Calcutta free of charge, will apply Immediately
to the British Government. throu?h;the Consul
la this City, asking that the careo be admitted
to India irec of all duty, and that the British
Government mtike provisions for the free
transportation of the grain from Calcutta to
interior points where the starving nÂ« lives are
to be found. This request will doubtless be
granted at once, as England is particularly
eager to nee the suffering alleviated In
London alone about $1,500,000 has already
beeti subscribed to the India relief fund, and
Will have been expended before the shipload
of corn now being bought up and contributed
in Nebraska shall have been carried from Port
CoÂ«ta to Calcutta. Already 500 tons of corn
have been promised in Nebraska alone, and
free transportation is assured from the rail
roads.
Teachers Will Get Their Money.
Auditor Broderick has concluded that the
half-month's salary held out from the school
teachers can be paid upon the showing; by the
Board of Education that the teitchers could
not possibly huve presented the demands for
the money within thirty days after It became
due.
