CANEA, Crete, Feb. 21.â The admirals â 
commanding tbe foreign fleets here yes- |
terday visited Colonel Vassos, the com- I
mander of the Greek army of occupation, ;
at Camp Aghita. What transpired there j
has not been made public, but upon tbe i
return of the admirals they invited the j
commander of the Greek warship Navati- i
chos Miaoulis to visit them. The in vita- !
tion was accepted and when the com
mander met the admirals he was informed
that an attack would be made upon the
Greek troops and the Greek warships if i
Colonel Vassos advanced into the interior. I
. Subsequently to the interview the com- j
mander, accompanied by Rear-Admiral i
. Harris, commanding the British fleet, pro
ceeded to the camp of Colonel Vassos, who
was informed as to the decision that bad
been arrived at by the commanding of
. ficers of the foreign fleet
"; 'This morning the insurgents in the ;
. vicinity of Canea began tiring on tbe town, j
; despite the warnings that had been given. I
The tiring was continued for some time, |
. whereupon the admirals of the foreign
fleets ordered their vessels cleared for j
action, and soon the guns of the fleet were ;
â¢.throwing shells into the insurgent camp, j
A British cruiser was the tirst of the j
warships to open fire, vessels of the other !
nations following in succession. Forty |
shells were tired.
' The forts tired blank: cartridges at the j
Greek dispatch-boat Plemoa, which had
exchanged shots with a Turkish frigate. j
Alter shots bad been tired by both vessels
the frigate withdrew.
The German warship Kaiserin Augusta j
"has arrived here and landed marines, who !
'will share in the foreign occupation of the
town.' j-.T-V'- . â¢ .. . . "--â -- 'â  -ââ¢>"*"
â¢Later â It has been learned that the ulti- I
L malum of the admirals to Colonel Vassos
* was against his attacking Canea. It' ap- â¢
parently did not forbid him from march- â¢
ing into the interior of the island, where j
Colonel Vassos purposes to occupy several j
fttrategic points.
One report states that the ultimatum
declared that if the Greek troops or the j
insurgents approached any nearer to |
Canea than they were the fleets would i
shell them, but -if they were quiet they
would be permitted to land food.
Colonel Vassos replied that he did not
â¢ intend to attack Canea or the flags of the
powers. He would remain on the defen
sive until he was attacked. Notwithstand
ing this assurance lighting took place to
day on the bills to the east of the town. [
The combatants, who were Christians and
Mussulmans only, were in plain view j
â¢ from the ships in the harbor. The reply j
of the Mussulmans to the fire of the Chris
trans was very feeble, and it could easily i
_ be seen that they would be compelled to
abandon their positions if the Christians j
â¢ pressed them. Their gun practice was so |
:â¢ very poor that it excited ridicule on board
the ships.
. The main position of the Christians was i
- lii a hamlet on the side of the hills where
they had hoisted the flag of Greece. This I
- . position was about 4000 yards from ihe i
warship- .
At half-past 4 o'clock the flagship dis- \
. played signals for the Dryad, Harrier and j
Kevenge and one vessel of the Italian,
German and Russian squadrons to op?n
fire on the Cretan position.
The order was quickly complied with. ,
The British vessels tired forty shells and
tho other vessels about thirty. The aim j
of tbe gunners was >cry good, and it was j
soon seen that the position of the insur- i
gents was becoming untenable. In about
ten minutes the Greek flag was hauled j
4 down and as soon as it disappeared the !
I order "Cease tiring" was given and the
guns of the fleet immediately became '
silent. Thereupon the flag was again |
hoisted on its staff. The rocks in t.e vi- ]
cinity were crowded with Cretans.
Tbe Mussulmans, encouraged and" em- i
boldened by the assistance which had been i
given them by the fleets of Christian Eu- J
rope, now began a lively fusillade on the i
Christians who were engaged in remov
ing their wounded. The Christians were j
evidently dispirited by the action of the
fleets, and made no attempt to return the. i
fire.
The action of the foreign warships has ,
caused the deepest indignation here, and '
the supporters of the Sultan are bitterly
denounced on all sides. It i* decided that j
.the powers in upholding Moslem rule by I
force of arras have made a melancholy !
and degrading spectacle that Greece will |
never forget.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 21.â A dispatch
from Athens to the Central News says
"" that the fleets of the powers to-day bom
â¢ barded the insurgent positions in the vi
â¢ cinity of Canea. No details of the bom
bardment are given.
The dispatch adds that the Greek dis- i
patch-boat Pienios has exchanged shots '
with a Turkish frigate, but in this case
'also details are lacking and both reports j
are accepted under reserve,
'i - It is reported that 700 Greeks and a num-
I ber of pieces of artillery have been landed
I at Kisamo Bay.
" A British torpedo-boat stopped the
Greek steamer Laurium, which was land
ing provisions ana munitions of war at
Kolymbar Bay, and e.corted her to Canea.
The excitement in Athens continues
without abatement, and the popular voice
Is loud for war if the annexation of Crete
to Greece can be obtained in uo other way.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
The populace demand that no attention be .
paid to the warnings and demands of the
powers, but that Greece maintain her po
sition in the face of Europe. A vast crowd
gathered this afternoon in front of the
palace and repeatedly cheered the King '
and the royal princes, whose actions meet
with the fullest approbation. The crowd
finally became so demonstrative tbai the
King appeared upon one of the balconies
of the palace and addressed the people.
He and the Government, he declared,
were fulfilling the mandate ofthe entire
Hellenic people in going to the aid of the ;
struggling Cretans and in seeking to re- j
gain possession of the island. He added '
that he prayed that God would strengthen
their efforts. His Majesty concluded his 'â 
address by thanking the people for the i
whole-hearted support they had given j
him.
The crowd became wild with delight
over the words of King George and the
applause was deafening when he con- !
eluded. Then after crying again and '
again, "Long live Greece," the crowd i
gradually dispersed.
ROME, Italy, Feb. 21.â The popular
agitation in Italy in favor of the union of
Greece and Crete is increasing daily and it
makes tbe position of th. Government j
difficult. Thirty members of the Cham
ber of Deputies have telegraphed con
gratulations to Athens upon the decided
Stand taken by Greece.
There were important popular manifes- j
tations in several towns to-day in favor of j
Greece. An enthusiastic meeting was j
held in Rome which declared in favor of :
raising a. volunteer corps to assist the i
Greeks in their attempt to free Crete of j
Turkish misrule. â --- --'â  ... â¢
After the meeting there was a manifes- J
tation in front of the Greek legation, tbe j
crowd cheering King George and the
Greek people.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Tcreey, Feb. 21.â
The Cretan troubles led to a serious fight
here to-day between a number of Greek '
and Turkish porters. Knives were Ireely j
used, and some of the combatants were |
wounded. All those who took part in the j
tight were arrested.

LONDON, Eng., Feb. âThe Berlin
correspondent ot the Times telegraphs
that there is reason to believe that ihe
powers have given in various degrees pro
visional approval of the German proposal
to blockade the Greek ports in order to
compel Greece to obey the orders of the
powers relative to Crete. The adoption of
tbe German proposal in some form if
Greece remains recalcitrant is becoming
extremely probable.

LONDON. Eng., Feb. 21.â The Daily
News correspondent at Canea telegraphs a
detailed account of the fighting at and
the abandonment of Fort Voukolis, which
the Christians subsequently blew up with
dynamite. The Moslems lost fifty killed
in the fighting. After the main body of i
Greek troops had returned to Platania
irom Voukolis news arrived that 500 Turks
aud 500 Basni-Bazouks were attempting
to advance from Canea, and that they
were held in check in a defile by a force of
200 Cretans.
Colonel Vassos sent a battalion of in
fantry and a company of chasseurs to

difficult to traverse, being heavily wooded,
but the Greeks managed to get through!
Tne Turks, when they learned of the ap
proach of re-enforcements, took positions

TAHITI DEFIES FRANCE'S POWER
Islanders Follow Cuba's Example
. and Revolt Against the
Unjust Taxation.
Taking Up Arms, the Natives Retire to
the Mountain Fastnesses and
Prepare to Battle to
the Death.
The cod of war is the only god wor
shiped in the Society Islands just now.
Natives, who originally owned the soil,
think they have a grievance against the
Frenchmen, who control the situation.
The latter own the group by the right of
conquest, but in all the years that have
passed since the Society Islands were
civilized and Papeete became its capital
the natives have been in constant rebel
lion. If trouble has not been brewing on
one island there has been an insurrection
on another, and the French warships
have been kept constantly on the move.
According to the officers of the brig
Galilee, now in this port, the present out
break has been the result of a preconcerted
movement. The natives have been groan
ing under the taxation put upon them by
the Government and many of them have
asserted that they will sooner die than
surrender.
"In the meantime the war spirit grows
, in Papeete,'' said one of the officers of the ]
I Galilee yesterday. "As soon as it was i
' known that there was trouble in Raiatea j
j sixty young men from Tahiti, all native- 'â¢
; born, but of French extraction, volun- |
j teered and equipped themselves for the j
â¢ campaign. They were reviewed before j
| the chief of division and then the Gov- |
j ernor presented them with -a flag which j
tbe ladies of Papeete had made lor them, j
"Some"of them may never see home ;
again. The natives are skilled in bush j
warfare, and while the warships may de- j
stroy tlieir villages and ruin their crops i
they will simply take another location
and erect new barricades.
"On one of the islands they hoisted the
British flag, but the marines stormed the
lort and tore it down. There is no signi
ficance in the matter, as the rebels ran the
flag up in order to keep the soldiers from
attacking them. They were mistaken,
however, as the sequence shows. One of
the warships had just returned to Papeete
when we were teady to sail, and while the
situation was not considered serious the
Government thought enough of it to issue
a call for extra aid."
The papers from Papeete contain very
i full reports of the campaign so far. They
begin with the first muster jujt after
Christmas.
. 'On December 28 the troops were re
viewed by Commandant Bayle under the
eyes of the refugees from Uturea.-. Seven
hundred armed men filed past and this
produced a most salutary effect upon the 1
natives, for they bad not believed that
such a large force could.be mustered,
p. But. the same the rebels, wbo knew of
the demonstration, persisted in maintain
ing that it had .been held only to frighten
them, and that- the troops would not
j marchâ the English would necessarily in
terpose, etc.
In spite of these absurd opinions, how
ever, desertions, from the rebel ranks be
came numerous. The deserters came over
to the French in groups of a dozen or
more at a time, carrying their guns, all of
one old-fashioned make, and their am*
munition.
Already 500 or 600 of these deserting
rebels bad goue to Utoroa, but only 25
had come from Tevaitoa to give up their
arms. . ,'. .
On December 31 the grand chief. Iri
pau from Tahaa, one of the three Gover
nors of the island, arrived at Tevaitoa.
accompanied by his secretary and ten
other rebels. They had to escape at night
for fear of being shot by their former com
radesat least that is what they said â
for desertion had been made a capital
offense.
On January 1, the amnesty fixed by the ;
Governor's ultimatum having expired, the
troops were divided into two columns.
One column was under orders to march
east and the other west. It was necessary
to occupy the valleys around Uturoa and
to dislodge tne rebels who were there and
who intended, according to certain infor
mation received, to attack the town that
day.
At the same time the Aube and the
I Duguay-Trouin went to Tahaa and bom

j Some troops were then landed, among
j them being a company of Tabitians. and
I in the scrimma c which followed Sail

spicuously displayed.
The rebels having fled the troops re
embarked and the two warships proceeded
to Tevaitoa and to Apoa and destroyed
, both those towns.
i "Tevaitoa was bombarded on January 3,
, and after the bombardment a column
under Commander Chocheprat was landed

poon ?, which latter they handled with great
dexterity, and during the tight they gave
vent to savage yells. At first they fought
desperately, but as the French over
whelmed them they fell back on all sides
and soon were routed. It was each one for
himself, and the natives scattered as they
ran, yelling and fighting, each trying to be
the first in the general retreat. They bad
good reason to run, for the' pursuing sail
ors and marines slaughtered all the strag
glers they could overtake, and the line of
the rebels' flight was strewn ' with their

were drawn up in line, their bayonets

killed. Four men had received trifling
wounds, from which they soon recovered,
and that was ail. But with the natives it
had fared badly. In the ditch which they
had so bravely defended against such
overwhelming odds seventeen of tns

The effect upon the rebels of the dis

tions. The latest phase of the Cretan po
sition confirms the view taken by German
official authorities that the acuteness of
the crisis which prevailed last week is
rapidly abating. Advices from Vienna say
that Count Goluchowski, the Austrian
Minister of Foreign Affairs, held a con
ference yesterday with ihe British and
Russian Embassadors to Austria and as
a result of the interview the Minister was
able to communicate to Emperor Francis
Joseph such reassuring news as justified
the Emperor in making preparations to
start for Cape Martin on Monday for a
. season of recreation.
The situation now inspires no immedi
ate disquietude. Germany submitted, or i
at least will submit, to the behests of the '
united powers, and the outlook for a com
* plete cessation of hostilities is extremely
promising. Whatever may be the ulti
mate result of the Kaiser's sudden inter
, Tention to prevent further aggressive
action the best German opinion credits
his Majesty with having averted the grav
est danger both to Greece and to Europe.
The policy of the Kaiser has in some
quarters been misconstrued as merely fol
lowing the lead of Russia and indifferent
to the claims of the Cretans or their Greek
kinsfolk. But the most reasonable and
least biased view of Berlin diplomacy is
that throu.hout this Cretan trouble it has
aimed at dealing with Crete as an integral
part of the whole Eastern question with
out prejudice to the ultimate claims of
Greece and Crete to have their mutual as
pirations satisfied. The Sultan's confi
dence in the Kaiser's oft-repeated deter
mination to maintain the rights of the
Porte has at this grave junture given the
declarations made independently through
Baron Yon Jeltsch perhaps greater weight
than even the concerted representations
of th** Embassadors.
At Athens also direct German diplo
macy and the Kaiser's personal influence
have been at work to prevent such wide
spread outbreak of hostilities as would
lead to a general conflagration in the
Balkan peninsula. Outside of official cir
cles, where the whole matter is that of
concentrated interest in gettmc Greece to
obey t c great powers, the public tee.'ing
in Germany tends toward sympathy with
the Greco-Cretan movement. It must be
aid, however, that there is no especially
strong sentiment in favor of the Greeks.
Their national character is well known
and has been financially unfavorably felt
in Germany. Bankrupt in finance and
p.ltogether bankrupt in commercial honor,
regardless also of her disrepute as to both,
Greece has lost the savor of tradition
which made romantic her early strugeles
for independence, 'Tis an ill-smelling
Greece that now grabs at the first tidbit
to be distributed when the general scram
ble for Turkey becomes inevitable.
To the German people, as to its Govern
ment, it is not sentiment toward Greece,
but considerations forthe peace of Europe
that come first. Germany now holds nomi
nally 36.000.000 marks of Greek loans upon
which the interest has not been paid and
.possession of Crete would burden Greece
Still more.
The Russian militaty attache at Con
stantinople, Colonel Peachkoff, who was
appointed a member of the commission to
reorganize the Cretan gendarmerie reports
that while in Crete in the performance of
his mission he became convinced that the
Cretans did not wish to be transferred
from a Turkish to a Greek regime, but
would greatly prefer a good home admin
istration. In conclusion Colon I Peach
koff says that should Greece obtain pos
session of Crete the island would become
an intolerable burden to her. -

BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 21.â The British
steamer Galilee, which arrived today from
London, made an unsuccessful attempt to
tow the disabled German tank steamer
Diamant into the port of Halifax, N. S.
The captain of the Galilee reports that he
sighted the Diamant February 10 in lati- ,

latter bad lost her propeller and signaled
for assistance. The Galilee took the dis

ary 17 in tbe morning, during a severe gale,
the hawsers parted and the Diamant dis
appeared from view. As the disabled

of the Galilee fear she has capsized. A
large portion of tbe Galilee's permanent
port cattle-fittings was lost overboard dur

After losing the Diamant the Galilee re
mained about the spot eighteen hours, but
could get no sight of the missing vessel.
Signals were burned during the night, but

the Diamant about sixty miles. The latter
vessel was bound from Brernerhaven lor

Elections.

Wolcott Mike, a Favorable
Impression.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 21.â The de
velopments of the Austrian elections al
most divide interest in Germany with tho
Eastern crisis. The submerging of the
German Liberals, the growth ot the new
Czech and anti-Semite c ements and the
obvious strength of the Clerical party are
all factors which are felt as destined to
have influence upon German affairs, inter
nal and external. Since Dr. Rieger, the
old Czech leader, advised his party at the
convention on the Oth inst. to coalesce
with the young Czechs in the electoral
struggle against Germans, Socialists and
anti-Semites the coalition has been partly
effected. In other sections there are can
didates of the young element opposing
candidates of the old. A forecast gives
some forty seats in the new Reich.rath to
the young Czechs and ten to the old.
The combined factions will demand the
official use of tne language by the admin
istrative and judicial authorities in Bo
hemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia and
the coronation of the Emperor as King of
Bohemia on the coming commemoration
of the fiftieth anniversary of his ascent to
t..e throne. The coronation question,
long agitated in Bohemia, is believed to
be settled, Count Badini having recom
mended and the Emperor having assented
to it to satisfy the Bohemians.
The Ami - Semite leader, Dr. Lueger,
is now apparently in vigorous health
and has been at aristocratic balls
in Vienna. At one of these, tbe ball at
the Town Hall, whi marks the closing of
the carnival season, the Emperor made
a short stay. He made a sort of state prog
ress through the gothic hall and other com
partments, accompanie.i by a numberof
court notables, the Papal Nuncio and
some church dignitaries. The Jews were,
of course, conspicuous by their absence.
'Anti-Semites and Socialists are nightly

That -trange figure in socio-religiou?
politics, the Abbe Stojalewski, against
whom some twenty sentences for breach
of public order, the press laws or some
thing else have been recorded, has caused
a foment among the Polish peasants in
Galicia which menaces the old privileges
of priests and laudlords to control their
votes.
Stojalewski, who has his headquarters
at Czaleza, near the Galician frontier, has
organized a wide agitation among the
peasants against nobles, priests and Jews.
His Chri.mui socialism has a much more
pronounced leaning toward the socialism
of Karl Marx than anything of the same

for the time-being on a large section of j
Galician pea-ants.
The difl_cultyÂ«confronting Bob Kneebes,
the American trotting-horse owner con
victed of ringing a horse on the German
tracks and sentenced to nine months' im
prisonment, in deciding whether to ac
cept his sentence or make a second ap
peal, is largely a question of expense.
Kneebes has been nearly ruined by the
costs of the proceedings against bim, and
it is said ithat he is now to be proceeded
against for attempting to unduly influ
ence certain witnesses, among whom may
be mentioned the hotelkeeper, Nixon, and
Hans, a trainer. If the court proceeds
against Kneebes he will not be let out on
bail alter the expiration of his sentence.
The law allows bard labor for -such an
offense and the court could not assume the
danger of bis absconding. Whatever the
guilt of Kneebes may be, his lot is hard,
considering that he voluntarily came over
from America to stand his first trial.

The Tagliche Rundschau, which is sun

that the Foreign Oflica well know who

GENERAL HARRISON
IS AGAIN A FATHER
Arrival of a Bouncing Baby Girl
Gladdens the Heme of the
Ex-President.
Chi dish Prattle Will Now Brighten
the Hippy D3laware*Street
Mansion.
INDIANAPOLIS, Isd.. Feb. 2LâGen
eral Benjamin Harrison is the father of a
little girl, which arrived at the Delaware
street mansion at 5 o'clock this morning.
Dr. Henry Jameson officiated at the event
and under his care Mrs. Harrison and the
daughter are progressing finely.
Indianapolis has been on the gui vive for
this announcement for a month past, and
almost daily tbere have been rumors to the
effect that the child had arrived. Dr.
Jameson was called last night, and with
Mrs. Barmutn, the same nurse wbo at
tended "Baby McKee," was in attendance
until morning. Mrs. Parker, Mrs. Harri
son's sister, was also present, having come
from New York some days ago.
The little girl is a finely formed child
and weighs 8% pounds. Preparations for
the a.rival have been going on at the Har
rison home for months, and the array of
baby clothes that has been made is suffi
cient to satisfy tbe fastidious tastes of even
an ex-President's daughter.
Most of the fine embroideries that tbe
little one will wear were stitched by Mrs.
Harrison's own hands. The wardrobe is
nearly all in pure white, although a faint
shade of blue appears in the ribbons and
in tbe fittings of the cradle.
General Harrison did not sleep during
tbe night and asked tha' hi- daughter be
brought to him shortly after ber arrival.
He seemed to be delighted, and if there
was in bis mind any disappointment that
it was not a boy he gave no indication of
it. This morning was the first Sunday
since his return from* his summer sojourn
in the mountains that General Harrison
has not occupied the family pew in the
First Presbyterian Churoh. The an
nouncement of the arrival had reached the
church, however, and Mrs. Harrison has
been the recipient of a shower of flowers
and little notes of congratulation during
the day.
GHOSTLY MESSENGER OF DEATH.
Inspector of St. Louis Detectives Warned
of His Approachin End by an
Unearth/ V. si tor.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 21.â Inspector
William H. Williams of the city detective
department is a gentleman above re
proach and his word has never been
doubted. This evening he handed a note
to Chief of Detectives Desmond which
astonished tbat veteran. The note stated
that la. night while he (Williams) was
asleep in his room on the third floor of the
Four Courts he was visited by a ghost,
which awakened him and stated that he
had but a short time to live. The spook
advised him to prepare for death. The
visitor vanished through a closed door.
Williams spent to-day in arranging his
worldly affairs. He has made his will,
arranged for pallbearers and written fare
well letters. Corroborative of Williams'
story is the testimony of John Stevens,
janitor of the building, who says he en
countered the ghostly visitor as it passed
through the hail. There is no questioning
the belief of tbe Inspector in the reality
of the visitor and the warning, and tnere
is no disposition among his associates to
ridi cuie him.

ONLY NINE MORE
DAYS FOR WORK
The Fifty -Fourth Congress
Nearing the End of
It Session.
Appropriation Bills Will Occupy
the Remaining Time of
the Senate.
The House to Shut Down on Farther
Expenditures and Clear Up
Necessary Business
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 21.â Only
nine more working days remain for the
Fifty-fourth Congress, and the considera
tion of appropriation bills will compel the
Senate to make up for the time lost in a
futile attempt to ratify the arbitration
treaty, which now appears to have been
shelved. The pending sundry civil and
the naval bills will probably cause some
debate. The President has so far ap
proved the legislative, the consular and
diplomatic, the Military Academy ano the
pension bills. The army bill is in confer
ence, and the agricultural bill was agreed
to in conference yesterday. The Indian
bill is now in the Senate, and will proba
bly not be passed before to-morrow night.
The District of Columbia bill is on the cal
"sidar, and will be called up as soon as the
Indian bill is out of the way. This bill
may lead to protracted debate owing to a
fight ween contending electric-light
companies.
The Appropriations Committee of the
Senate is still considering ihe postoffice.
the sundry civil and the fortifications b lls,
all of which will be reached in two or three
days. Of the remaining appropriation
measures the naval bill and the general
deficiency bill are still in the House.
The bankruptcy bill still maintains its
way as the unfinished business and will
only afford an opportunity for a few
speeches should time permit. There is no
hope of action. Mr. Sherman has said
that he will not again call up the arbitra
tion treaty and no more time will be con
sumed in the consideration of that con-
vontion at this session.
The House will also occupy the re
mainder of its time in a charing up of
necessary business. Three hours' debate
on the Pacific railroads paragraph of the
general deficiency bill will be taken on
Monday in committee of the whole, and
then probably another day will be spent
in going over the measure in open house.
The passage of bills under suspension of
the rules comes in order during the clos
ing days of th. session, but the House
leader, seem determined to sit down on
all measures asking lor further appropria
tions of money.

"It had been my intention to make no
announcement in regard to the action I
would take in regard to filling the pros
pective vacancy in the Ohio representa
tion in the United States Senate until the

of the manifest interest of the people and
their desire to know what will be done, I
deem it best now to make the following
statement: Wuen Senator Sherman re
signs to enter the Cabinet of President
McKinley I will appoint to succeed him
Hon. Marcus A. Hanna of Cuyohoga
County to serve until . bis successor is
chosen by the Seventy-third General As

National Chairman refused to discuss the
matter.
"I do not doubt the authenticity of the

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 21.â Governor
' Bushnell said to the United Assoc ated
Pre-ses correspondent to-night that he
would be a candidate ior the nomination
of Governor before the Republican State
convention this year an i for that alone.
He would not be a candidate for election
to the Senate by the Legislature now;
probably never would be. The Governor
said he had not reached the determination
to appoint Mr. Hanna sad enly. It had
been in his mmd for several weeks, but
it was his idea that he ought not to pub
licly announce his intention until the va
cancy actually existed.
Governor Bushnell scouted the idea
that he had been induced to appoint
Chairman Hanna by the fact that George
D. Cox of Cincinnati had declared for
him. Governor Bushnell said he consid
ered what the distinguished sei vices of
Mr. Hanna to the party were, and the
standing of Senator Sherman in the party
âthe latter having asked that Hanna be
appointed to succeed him, made, it in
cumbent upon him to bestow this honor
as he had determined to do.

Mr. Hanna is expected hereon Tuesday, i
and there will be several other prominent <

McCook of New York will probably be
one of tbem, and if he comes he is likely
to be offeied a Cabinet position.
His appointment has not yet been de
cided upon, but the chances are that he
will be the New York man in Major Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet. The belief here to-night
is that he will be given an opportunity to
accept the portfolio of the Interior De
partment.
James A. Gary of Baltimore will proba
bly be Postmaster-General, for there is no
disposition to shift ex-Governor Long of
Massachusetts from the Navy Depart

FOR A MONETARY CONFERENCE
House Committee en Coinage, Weights and
Mecsures Makes a Favorable Report
on the Subject.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 21.â The
House Committee on Coinage, Weights
and Measures has it-red a favorable re
port, with an amendment, on tie resolu
tion providing for the representation of
the United States by commissioners at
any international monetary conference
hereafter to be held. The action of the
committee was practically unanimous, no
division being baa on the motion to report.
The resolution reads:
Whenever after March 4, 1897. the President
of the United Stales shall determine that the
United States should be represented at any in
ternational conference called by the United
States or any other country with a view to
securing by international agreement a fixity
of relative values between gold and silver as
money by means of a common ratio between
these metals, with free mintage at such ratio,
he is bereby authorized to appoint five or more
commissioners to such international confer
ence, and lor compensation of said commis
sioners, and for all reasonable expenses con
nected therewith, to be approved by the Secre
tary of State, including th proportion to be
paid by. the United Mates of ibe joint expense
of any such conference, the sum of $100,000,
or so much there.)! as may be necessary, is
hereby appropriated. And the President of
the United States is hereby authorised in the
name of the Government of the United States
to call at his discretion such international con
ference to assemble at: such point as may be
agreed upon.
The following was added to the bill to
day on motion of C. W. Stone of Pennsyl
vania:
And he Is further authorized, if in his judg
ment the purpo-e specified in the first section
hereof can thus be better obtained, to appoint
one or more special commissioners or envoys
to such oi the nations of Europe as he may
designate, to seek diplomatic negotiations
and international agreement forthe purpose
sp cified in the first section hereof. And in
case of such appointment so much of the ap
propriation herein made as shall be necessary
shall be available for the proper expenses and
compensation of such commissioners or en
voys.
That so much of an act approved March 2,
1895 entitled "An act making appropriation
for the sundry civil expenses of the Government
for the fiscal yearendiug June 30, 1896. a.id for
other purposes," as provides for the appoint
ment of dele-rates to an iiiternational confer
ence and makes appropriation for their com
pensation and expenses be and the same is
bereby repealed.
STATE FAIR BILL
RAISES A RUMPUS
Sacramento Angry at the
Promoters of the
Measure.
But Oakland Is Apparently Too
Late to Secure the
Transfer.
S nator Stratton Says Assemblyman
Wright Shon d Have Got to
Work Earlier.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 21.â While
Sacramento is indignant and in some
dread an l Oakland in a state of exultant
hope over the proposition to remove the
State Fair from the Capital City, there is,
accorning to the view of Senator Siratton,
as little prospect of the State Fair going
to Oakland at this time as there is of the
Capitol building itself being.moved to tho
Venice of the Pacific.
The idea was one that originated on the
BDur of the moment. Had it been promul
gated during tbe early portion of the ses
sion of the Legislature there would have
been a good chance of victory for Oakland,
for Alameda County has a contingent in
both houses tbat has made a most enviable
record for energy and intelligence. The
matter .being agitated, however, at this
late stage of the session, when business is
more or less behind and when everything
possible is being done to bring about an
adjournment as soon after the 4th of
March as possible, has little hopes of suc
cess.
No bill that is introduced at this time
has much prospect of passing both houses.
And this would hold good particularly in
reference to any measure that is likely to
arouse antagonism and a resulting heated
and prolonged debate.
Assemblyman Wright introduced "the
bill providing for the transfer of the State
Fair from Sacramento to Oakland yester
day, and the promoters of the project ap
proached Senator Stratton ot Alameda at
the same time and requested him to intro
duce a similar bill in tbe Senate. This
Senator Stratton declined to do, giving as
a reason for his rather unexpected conduct
the opinion he entertained that the bill
stood no chance of success. Speaking to a
representative of The Call in reference to
the matter be said:
"It may seem strange to my friends and
constituents tbat I have refused to father
this bill, but I must say in all candor that
I do not think it has any chance of being
passed coming at this period. Had it been
suggested at a seasonable time I should
have been only too glad to have intro
duced it and to have put forth my best
efforts to secure its passage. I heartily
indorse the proposition and believe it
would be a good t dug for the State at
large and certainly for Oakland, tint a
measure introduced ai tbi. time is almost
certain to be swamped under ordinary
circumstances, and when there is opposed
to it a strong element such- as that com
posed of Sacramento, ail the northern
and even some of the southern counties,
it can readily be seen what little prospect
there is of its ever being permitted to see
day light again after being introduced.
"My action in declining to introduce a
bill of this kind will not prevent me, how
ever, from giving tbe strongest support to
tbe measure submitted to the House by
Assemblyman Wright, should that
measure ever reach lh. Senate."
LEE THREATENS TO RESIGN.
Weary of Battling tor American Prisoners
Without the Backing of the
Administration.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 21.â Rumors
have prevailed all day here that some
thing stirring occurred in Havana yester
day though it cannot be confirmed as yet
in any way. The story is that General
Lee is weary of his work, and is ready and
anxious to resign if the administration
will not back him up in his latest case
that of freeing all American political
suspects in ranK Spanish dungeons, or at
least securing them a speedy civil trial,
such as they are entit'ed to.
The case of Dr. Ruiz, it is claimed,
brought this up. General Lee investi
gated tbe so-called suicide report and dis
credits it. He cabled his suspicions to
Secretary Olney and was told to investi
gate. This he did, and then demanded of
the Spaniards that the body be disinterred
and a po-'t mortem held. This was re
fused. Olney upheld Lee, and finally it
was conceded by the Spaniards. The post
mortem was held yesterday. While it re
vealed no actual traces of foul play, yet
Lee decided that his information was such
as almost to prove it. It is reported that
be and the Spanish officials had sharp
words on the subject.
General Lee then, it is said, cabled Sec
retary Olney that the administration
must uphold bim in bis demand for the
instant release of all Americans unjustly
imprisoned as political suspects, or tbat
they be given speedy civil trials, the de
mand to be enforced with the presence of
American warships. If not, then he would
resign. . .-: X- -

I should state that from the day of the
arre t of Ruiz to the day of his death in

having his papers in their possession,
never took the trouble to inform General
Lee that an American had been arrested,
and he was only kept informed of the

Woods Stunned by a Bow From the
Championâ Wolcott Will Not
Meet Green.
4 CARSON, Nev., Feb. 21.â This was a
quiet Sabbath in Carson. Both Corbett
and Fitzsimmons have left town and gone
to their training-quarters, and while the
t crowd of visitors continues to prow there
â¢was during the day a noticeable absence
I of the sidewalk gatherings and knots of
' â¢ _-ht debaters that have given the main
thoroughfare of the town so much fife dur
ing the past few days. The activity was
on the roads to Shaw's Springs and to
Cook's ranch to-day instead of on the
sidewalks, and no doubt this will continue
to be the case from now until the day of
the great battle. It is a harvest lor the

liverymen, such as they never dreamed of
before, and they are not neglecting to take
advantage of the golden chance to line
their pockets with gold. The newspaper
correspondents are their special prey, for
they realize that these hapless fellows are
compelled to visit the trainers' quarters
daily, and thr.t walking is completely out
of the question in this icy weather.
â¢â¢.' Corbett's quarters receive the bulk of
the road travel to-day because the road to
J-iiaws Springs is in lar better condition
than that which winds its way out to
Cook's ranch, and, besides, it was gener
ally understood that a vi-it to Fitzsim
mons' new home would afford nothing of
interest, because his gymnasium was not
fitted up and he would be seen only loung
ing around in his street clothe?, instead of
stripped and buffeting his trainers.
The Cornishman went out to his train
ing quarters this morning, and disdained
to ride in tbe sleigh which his manager,
Julian, had provided for him.
"No; 1 need a little exercise and a breath
of fresh air," he said. "You ride out, and
Hickey and I will jog it."
This conversation took place in the
Arlington Hotel, where Julian put in an
appearance and announced that the rig
vas waiting. Fitz may have had bis
reasons for wanting to walk and inhale
some ozone. He did not awaken feeling
as well as he did last night. Ho com
plained of a faintness and the absence of
his usual desire to eat.
Julian and Hickey coaxed him into the
'dining-room of the Arlington and Fitz
partook oi a light breakfast rather un
willingly. Shortly after breakfast be was
seized by a severe attack of retching and
was in distress lor ten or fifteen minutes.
He soon recovered, and it was then that
he expressed a desire to leave town and
get to his training quarters. Fitz made
light of bis ailment, saying it was but
temporary and the result of long and con
tinued railroad travel. Besides, he said,
the hot air and cigar smoke in the hotel
lobby and corridors stifled bim.
Bob did little more than rest during the
day at the ranch. The run and tramp
through tbe tbree miles of snow interven
ing between the hotel and the training
quarters was a try-out of itself of no insig
nificance, considering the rarity of the
atmosphere, and when the lanky Cornish
man bad finished his journey he was
wringing wet and was compelled to change
ail of his clothing.
* "1 really would not object if this snow
did not melt and disappear at all," said
Bob* while he was dry and resting. "I
believe it is more invigorating and
strengthening to haul yourself through
the drifts than to sprint on a clean road.
The only thing that would make me long
for the thaw is the desire to get out for a
spin on bicycle."
Fitzsimmons' baggage came up from the
depot late this afternoon and was sent out
to the ranch. It comprised nearly a dozen
trunks and boxes, containing boxing
gloves. Indian clubs, pulley-welj-hts and
all sorts of muscle-developing machines.
The load broueht into requisition th
roomiest express sleigh in town and even
then ttiere was no space to spare.
Julian superintended the transportation
of the traps and then immediately re
turned to town. He took supper at the
Arlington and hurried off to catch the
evening train to San Francisco. The rea
sou for his sudden departure is quite a
mystery here. He confided to no one that
be was going, and when asked for an ex
planation at the depot he vouchsafed in an
evasive way that he was going after "pro
visions."
There was a rumor that both Julian and
Fi tzsimmons are out of funds and that the
object of the former's journey is to "raise
the wind" temporarily, but this the jolly
little manager and brother-in-law denied
vehemently. , .
"Just a little business, my boy, that's
all," he said. "It may be that while lam
in San Francisco I will engage the Me
chanics' Pavilion for the evening of
March 19 in order that Fitzsimmons may
celebrate his victory over Corbett by giv
ing an exhibition and illustrating how he
turned the trick. The then undisputed
champion of the world would draw a tre
mendous house. I am so certain that
Bob wili win that I would not hesitate a
moment about putting up a deposit to
secure the Pavilion for his use after the
fight."
This was Jim Corbett's busy day. It
was the real beginning of bis actual train
ing for the comin - contest for the world*
championship. He was up with the lark
and much to the discomfiture of his train
ers, insisted upon working like a Trojan
all day. The bulk of the work fell upon
Billy Woods and Joe Corbett, becaus*) big '
Jack McVey was taken sick during the
night ana was incapacitated for the drill,
and besides the full staff of handlers is
not yet on the ground, Delaney, While
and Jeffries being still due at the springs.
This made no difference to Corbett. He
dragged Woods and brother Joe out
bright and early and thumped them with
the mittens throughout the livelong day.
"It is business with me from now on."
explained Jim to The Call correspondent.
"Although I appreciate the fact that the
fight is nearly a month off yet, still 1 con
sider every moment of value. 1 am in
pood shape right now, but I want to be
better. So much money will be wagered
on my chances in tbis fight that, in order
to do my friends justice, I must not over
look a single detail in my training. If it
should be my misfortune to get whipped
I want to have it to say that I did the best

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1897.
ARRIVAL OF FITZSIMMONS, JULIAN AND HICKEY AT CARSON.
I could, and that I gave my friends a run
for their money. I only refer to such a
result as a bare possibility, not a proba
bility."
Mrs. James J. Corbett is going to make
the belt which her hero will wear in the
ring when he meets the Cornishman. Jim
wrote a long letter to her this evening, in
which he detailed tbe style of girth he
desired. It is to be in tbe nature of a
sash and will bear the stars and stripes,
emblematic of the honor of America, and
also a miniature flag of Ireland, out of re
spect to St. Patrick's day.
Jim's work for to-day began with a long
walk over the roads in the vicinity of the
springs before breakfast, and, an hour or
so after the meal, several games of hand
ball with Joe Corbett. This is the cham
pion's favorite pastime, and he plays the
game as if a fortune depended upon the
result rather than that he expected to
derive any muscular benefit. He quarrels
good-naturedly with his opponent over
every technical play in the game, and
cheats whenever he gets an opportunity.
His ambition is to win at any cost. He
is an accomplished player, nevertheless,
and it takes an expert to give him any
kind of a rub.
After the handball Jim put on the pil
lows with Billy Woods. The latter ap
peared to-day with his face and head hid
den beneath a big, padded leathern mask,
with only a peephole in the front of it to
permit him to see and to breathe. This,
explained Woods, meant that Corbett had
gone in for his heaviest hitting practice.
Billy was anxious to escape having bis
jaw or nose broken.
"There is not money enough in the
country to hire me to stand up in front of
that man bareheaded day after day," said
Woods. "Ho is hitting his hardest now,
and I would not Inst a week unless I was
protected. Fitziimmons will have occa
sion to know something about these
thumps before he gets through with Jim.
By the way, I see that in some of his ex
clusive interviews Fitzsimmons refers to
mc as a has-been and a dub and not capa
ble of keeping Corbett warm. Well, F.tz
simmons can have it his way, but after
the 17th of March he will find himself in
my class and maybe I might consent to
give bim a match."
Despite the protection afforded Woods
by the mask Corbett caught him once
with a right hook on the side of the head
which sent him reeling across the hand
ball court. He would have fallen had not
Jim caught him.
"And still some people persist in saying
that that man can't hit," moaned Woods,
as under the influence of a dash of cold
water in his face he began to emerge from
his temporary trance.
Joe Corbett took Woods' place, and after
a lively bout the morning's work was
done. The rub down and rest before din
ner followed. In the afternoon the same
performance was repeated, and following
with a few games of whist after supper,
after which the champion retired.
During the earlier part of the evening
Eddie Cooke informed Corbett that Martin
Julian bad told Fitzsimmons that he
would have a walkover, as the Caltfornian
looked like a ghost. Corbett did not seem
to relish this and said nothing. The rest
of the party Kept quiet, too, until finally
Slingerland, mine host of Shaws Springs,
broke the silence by remarking in his cus
tomary droll way:
P. J. DONOHOE, the San Francisco Architect, Who Designed
Stuart's Mammoth Amphitheater.
"Well. I've known of ghosts scaring
people pretty badly now and then."
This was the signal for some uproarious
laughter and everybody was in good
humor again. -
A force of men went out to the race
track to-day under the direction of Archi
tect P. J. Donohoe and began clearing
away the snow from the spot selected for
the site of Dan Stuart's mammoth amphi
theater. This work will be completed to
morrow forenoon and then the laying of
the foundation will begin.
There is no prospect of a match between
George Green of San Franci-co and Joe
Wolcott of Pittsburg, which was billed to
take place on the 16th of March. Wolcott
seems to be troubled with the malady that
bothers Sharkeyâ caput elephantiasis, the
doctors call it â and wants a slice of tho
earth in return for his condescending to
appear in the Carson ring. A purse of
$5000 is not enough for him, so he wired
to Stuart, but the sports now here are in
clined to believe it is rather more a case of
"cold feet*' regarding a meeting witb the
dashing San Francisco welter-weight.
Negotiations are now under way to get
"Mysterious" Billy Smith to meet Green
for the $.5000. Green has signified a will
ingness to meet anybody in the world at
his weight Tommy Ryan, Joe Wolcott or
Jack McAuliffe preferredâ but the diffi
culty seems to be to get somebody to meet
him.
Harry Corbett left for San Francisco
this morning with a pocketful of commis
sions to place money on both the heavy
weights. Poolselling will begin to-mor
row and Fitzsimmons will command the
short price at 7to 10. Betting men pre
dict that Corbett will enter the ring a 2- to
1 favorite. Cornishmen employed in the
mines about Virginia will place their
earnings on Fitzsimmons, but the Eastern
sports are prepared to bet tbem to a finish
at 10 to 7.
J. A. R. Elliott, champion wing shot,
has advised Stuart that he will be present
at the trap-shooting tournament, which
opens in the huge pavilion on the morn
ing of March 17, and will defend his title.
Tho tournament, which will last three
days, has been rendered more attractive
by an additional $1000 purse subscribed by
Stuart. The big Texan moved about the
house to-day, but was not at home to
callers. He is improving fast and will be
out of doors by the middle of the week.
Clear weather is predicted for to-morrow
and if it continues for ten days every road
in the State will be dry -Â»nd firm.
A number of Carson society fadies were
invited to call on Corbett this afternoon
and see him at work. Miss Ida Biroth,
niece of Governor Sadler, volunteered to
lead the party and was the first to venture
Into the handball court, wbere the cham
pion was massaging Woods' rubber face.
The ladies were astonished at the cham
pion's appearance and manners, but the
fact that none of his teeth were missing
surprised them more. They went away
satisfied that boxing is far less brutal than
football.
When shown the New York dispatch
stating that Joe Vendig had entered suit
against Dan Stuart for breach of contract
In connection with the dissolution of the
Florida Athletic Club, Stuart's secretary,
W. R. Wheelock, said:
"I cannot understand Vendig's action.
He has no claim on us. I settled the part
nership accounts of both Vendig and
Stuart. The latter advanced most of the
funds and carried VÂ«?ndig through. After
the Maher- Fitzsimmons fight Vendig was
unable :o make good his liability and we
accepted his note for his indebtedness,
payable in four months. When the note
matured he could not lift ii and we had to
take the money ln driblets. He never ad
vanced us one cent and has no interest
whatever in the present carnival."
Noted Sports Will Attend.
CHICAGO. 111., Feb. 21.â Mr. Glickauf
and Vere Davies are preparing to run a
special train to Carson for the big fight
over the Rock Island from Chicago. They
say they have already booked Joe Vendig
and party from New York; "Parson"
Davies with Jimmy Barry and party, Billy
Catton, the billiard player from Rock
Island, and party; John L. Sullivan, the
ex-champion; Joe Cboynski and several
other pugilists and sports.
TWENTY HOLL IRS A SEAT.
Stuart Plxes the Minimum Figure for
Reserved Chairs.
Secretary Wheelock, who is attending to
Dan Stuart's correspondence, has written
to W. R. Vice of the Union Pacific in this
City that there would be no reserved seats
for the Carson fight sold at less than $20.
This reply came yesterday to an urgent in
quiry wired to Stuart by Vice some days
ago.
"It is this way," explained the railroad
man ; "scores of people call on us -t^
day asking our rates to and from the fight,
and they also want to know how much it
will cost to reserve a seat in the arena.
Our answer is that $16 50 will land them
in Carson just before the fight, and will
bring them back again. Calculation must
then be made for $3 or $6 for Pullman
service, exclusive of meals.
"Not until to-day could we give an an
swer as to the admission to the tight, which
will range from $5 to $40. The former fig
ure is for the privilege of entering the
building. From that figure to $20 will be
charged for scrambling privilege for bench
seats in more or less advantageous loca
tions. But if a full-fledged reserved seat
is to be had nothing less than $20 can be
paid."
Al Hampton, the well-known local hand
ball expert, has been engaged by Corbett
and will leave to-morrow night for Carson,
where he is to handle the champion in that
particular line of exercise.
Major Hooper of the Occidental Hotel is
arranging for a couple of Pullman cars for
his hot* 1 patrons and a party of army and
navy officers.
Douglass White, the newspaperman, and
William Sink of the Baldwin Hotel have
already arranged for the transportation of
00 people.

of the fact that he is legless and uses arti

TEXAS MURDERER
CAUGHT AT NAPA
Charles Kugadt Arrested
for the Killing of a
Woman.
Accused of Having Slain His
Half-Sister and Burned
Her Body.
The Prisoner Claims She Lost Her
Life Under the Wheels of
a Wagon.
NAPA, Cal., Feb. 21.â Charles Kugadt,
alias John Frey, was arrested last night
by Sheriff George McKenzie at the in
stance of the Sheriff of Washington Coun
ty, Texas, charged with the murder of
his half-sister in that county on October
19, 1896. The crime was an unusually
atrocious one. Kugadt's half-sister was
about to return to Germany and had sev
eral dollars on her person when he started
with her to a railway station. Sho was
not seen alive after that, but later her
charred body was found in the ruins of
her trunk and valise, which had served as
a funeral pile when the murderer cre
mated her body.
Kugadt was stopping at a boarding
house at the corner of Main and Pearl
streets. He had retired, and when there
came a knock on his door he called
out, "Who is there?" The owner
of the place, John Smith, responded, and
the man, apprehending no danger, opened
the door. Sheriff McKenzie immediately
seized him and pinioned his arms so that
resistance was useless if it had been at
tempted.
When shown a photograph taken in
Texas Kugadt acknowledged it at his own.
He knew what he was arrested for but
said he would prove his innocence.
_ Kugadt resided in Napa nine years ago,
at which time he worked as a cobbler for
George Head, a shoe-dealer. His wife and
little child were with him and they occu
pied rooms in Smith's lodging-house.
Smith says that Kugadt conducted him-
CHARLES KUGADT, Arrested at Napa for the Murder of His
Half-Sister in Texas.
self as a gentleman and gave him no
cause for complaint. Later he went back
to Texas.
About three months ago Kugadt, unac
companied by his wife or child, returned
to Napa and began working for D. Keig, a
shoedealer. He was faithful, industrious,
courteous and gentlemanly and won the
respect of his employer. Keig could hardly
believe that Kugadt conld be guilty of the
crime charged against him. When he be
gan working for Keig he went by the name
of John Frey, telling Mr. Keig that only
a German could pronounce his true name.
When placed in jail Kugadt appeared al
most prostrate. This morning his appe
tite was gone and he desired no food.
This afternoon the prisoner was visited
by a Call representative, to whom he told
his story. His face showed that he bad
been weeping, and as he referred to his
wife or to his dead sister he burst into
tears.
"I lived with my wife and child in the
county of Washington, Texas," he began.
"On the morning of October 19, 1896, about
5 o'clock, 1 started with my half-sister,
Miss Johanna Kugadt, to Branham, nine
teen miles distant, where she was going
to board a train. She was intending to
go to Germany. There were two roads
leading to Branham, and at the request of
my sister we took the longer road, which
was much smoother. We passed Whit
man about 6 o'clock in the morning. I
met several friends there. When we
reached New Year's Creek we stopped for
lunch which we had brought with us. I
unhitched and fed the horses.
"After eating I hitched the horses, pre
paratory to continuing the journey. My
sister went to the left side of the wagon to
get in and I stood by the horses, which
were strong and fiery. As she was on tho
wheel of the wagon the horses started and
she was thrown to the ground between the
front and the rear wheel. She was lying
on her right side. Before I could stop the
horses the rear wheel, which was very
heavy, passed over her neck and head. I
stopped the horses and went to her assist
ance. As I attempted to raise her she
said, 'I can't travel.' These were the last
words she uttered, although some time
passed before she died. I placed her ten
derly in the wagon and bolstered her up
with a blanket and pillow. By her eyes â
her power of speech was gone she signi
fied that she was all right.
"I turned the horses and started for
home. After driving about a mile she
made a slight noise, and as I looked blood
oozed from her nose and mouth down onto
the pillow. _ stopped under a tree. Her
m
eyes became bright an glassy and soon
she was dead. This was about 10 or 11
o'clock. I took my overcoat and placed it
over ber. I soon met a negro named
Meredith and meant to tell him, but dared

LOS ANGELES LOTTERY SWINDLE.
White Men Conducing a Game of Chance
on the Mongolian
Plan. .
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 21.â
first instance, so far as known, where
white men have attempted to conduct a
Chinese lottery swindle was brought to
the attention of the potice authorities last
night through the arrest of Charles Hen
sey, a ticket vender for the layout.
The name of the concern is "The Los
Angeles Company" and it is in nearly all
respects conducted as the Chinese lot
teries are. The tickets are printed in the
same style, the numbers being in English
instead of Chinese and running from No. j
Ito 80 inclusive. They are marked with
a brush, as in the Chinese style, and the
drawings and payments are made in the
same manner. Hensey, after his arrest,
gave tbe information that the lottery was
capitalized to the extent of $5000 by four
white men, woo, he claims, are well
known in Los Angeles business circles.
The lottery has been in existence only
four days, but the organization is very
complete, the people having their own
lawyer and a board of directors.
Officer Sparks went into Hensey's shop
on Los Angeles street and there obtained
sufficient evidence to make out a clear
case against the man. Sparks bought
tickets and Hensey unfolded the whole
scheme of the lottery to the poiicemaD.
Behind Hensey's harness-shop there is a
regular Chinese lottery office, but this is
not in connection with the white "Chi
nese" lottery. The ticket procured is
marked No. 48, that being the number of
the agent who sold it, showing tbat tbe
company already has a goodly number of
men selling the tickets. Hensey is held
in $200 bonds and $50 cash bail, which was
later furnished by men evidently in
terested in the lottery swindle.
The headquarters of the company are
temporarily located above the Olympic
saloon on First street, according to Hen
sey's statement. He says it is the com
pany's intention to establish a regular
office later.

MRS. ADINA MITCHELL of Los Angeles, Trustee of the
"Whittier State School.
GUIDING ARIGHT
UNWILLING YOUTH
Mrs. Adina Mitchell Tells
of Reform Work at
Whittier. '
Favors the Removal of the Girls'
Department to Santa
Clara.
r
Special Education and a Separate
Home Should Be Given Young
Women.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 21,â The
removal of the girls' department of the
Whittier State Bchool from Whittier and
the establishment of a separate institution
at Santa Clara for the girls is a subject
which is being considered with great in
terest in those circles interested in philan
thropic work and particularly that branch
of sociology involving the reform of juve
nile delinquents. The suggestion of this
removal from Whittier is meeting with
general favor in this section much more
than would be supposed, which is in a
great measure due to the fact tbat the
girls' department of Whittier State School
haa been prominent in the public eye be
cause of the reforms and changes in the
department which have been urged by
Mrs. Adina Mitchell, one of the trustees
of the institution. Mrs. Mitchell, who is
the wife of the promiuent attorney John
W. Mitchell, was appointed by Governor
Budd on the Whittier board nearly two
years ago, and she has entered into the
work of the office with an industry and
understanding which have been almost
phenomenal.
On account of her official position, her
prominence in this community and her
familiarity with the subject Mrs. Mitchell
is now considered the leading authority
on the subjects involved in the removal of
the Whittles girls and the establishment
of the new institutions at Santa Clara,
and it is for these reasons that a Call re
porter visited Mrs. Mitchell to obtain her
views.
In response to a query Mrs. Mitchell
said: "Too much cannot be said in favor
of the removal of the girls' department of
Whittier to Santa Clara. I have for econ
nomical reasons favored the consolidation
of the boys' departments of Whitier and
Preston schools at Glen Ellen and the es
tablishment of a separate institution for
girls at lone or elsewhere, but this change
and consolidation does not now seem prob
able.
"The important point in question with
me is an independent institution for girls
and young women. I have never seen
the proposed site at Santa Clara, but all
the reports I have heard are exceedingly
favorable toward the establishment there
of a successfnl school of this class. And
certainly the citizens of Santa Clara have
been most liberal in their proposals to ob
tain this institution, and if the Legis
lature makes it possible to carry out the
Governor's recommendation in this par
ticular branch of reformatory training it
will place California in advance of many
other States in the same line of pro
gress."'
"What are your ideas of the scope of
this work?"
"That is almost limitless. Perhaps
many of the evils complained of by re
formers will never be remedied. But the
solution of the problems of sociology that
are agitating civilization will be helped if
men and women become more interested
in humankind and assist the work. Per
haps it colleges and universities gave less
time to the study of dead languages and
physical science and spent more time
upon the more complex and important
subject of the science of mankind and the
many questions affecting common hu
many, there would be more helpful sym
pathy, and particularly a better under
standing of the woman's side oF it.
"But as to the scope applied to the
reformation of young girl delinquents
there are many diversified features and a
number of extensions that might be
added to the present system of training
and education. Employment and studies
couid be given that would not only help
to prove the practical side and be of great
benefit as a recreation and pleasure, but
would also be a stimulus to lead these
girls and young women to nobler lives.
"It is a great mistake to imagine that
the only line of instruction to be pursued
in their education is that which will make
of them domestic servants. For many of
these girls are in their natures just as
those whose environments have been
more healthful and happy. Many of
them have noble impulses and hunger for
education and refined occupations. And
you know girls who nave this tendency to
be bad are not always found alone among
the ignorant and lower classes.
"In this wort* there are three great es
sentials. The first is to secure as officers
and attendants for this critical and deli
cate task those who have experience and
have studied the principles and methods
of charitable reform â specialists in this
line. Such a rule would secure men and
women whose hearts are in their labors,
those who have a true regard for human
kind and are willincand capable of mak
ing self-sacrifices for the betterment of
those less fortunate.
"The second is to Keep the girls and
young women employed and interested."
"Are there any suggestions you would
make with reference to the law to be
passed governing an independent school
for girls?"
"I can think of but one at this time and
that is this: Provision should be made
for young girls and women to be com
mitted to this institution between the
ages of 12 and 20 years, and to De kept there
until they are 21 years of age. The boys
are trained and cared for until they are
this age, and I think the girls need the
protection all the more between 18 and 21
years. Many glrlb are but children after
all at the age of 18. It is the most critical
time in their lives."
"What effect will this change have upon
your official relation to the girls."
"I can not say at this time. It may
terminate an official relation with the
girls, hut not my personal interest. I
shall continue to do all I can in this work,
whether as a private individual or as an of
ficial. But as to this, there are other
women interested In this work just as
sincere and competent as I can hope to be.
The need for such establishments has been
proven, and the impetus already given will
be sufficient to carry the work further and
on proper line?."

Did Not Know of His Good Fortune
Until Informed by a Chance
Remark.
PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 2L âM. M.
Koreff, a well-known commercial traveler
just bacK from a trip into Idaho, vouches
for the truth of this story of phenomenally
good leek: ':- 'â -..
About two weeks ago a miner offered
Morris Yenzel, a Moscow (Idaho) tailor, a
handful of mining slocks for a suit of
clothes. Yenzel refused that sort of cur
rency in payment for his labor and goods,
on the ground that he had no luck in
stocks. He remarked that five years ago
a miner gave him 5000 shares of stock,
then supposed to be worth 1 cent a share,
for a suit of clothes. He never realized a
nickel on tbe stock.
The miner Jocosely said that had it been
Le Roi stock it would have made him rich.
The tailor was startled and replied he was
quite certain that that was . the name of
the stock. He could not remember what
he did with it, as he never expected it to
amount to anything.
A few days later Yenzel went to the sus- ;
pended Moscow National Bank for an in
surance policy and some other papers de
posited there, among which he found the
missing 5000 shares of Le Roi stock, now
quoted at s3 per share, with accrued divi
dends. The story goes that the Le Roi
mine-owners have been negotiating with
an English syndicate for the sale of the
property. The syndicate declined to ac
cept the mine without the transfer of
every share of stock so far issued. This
block of 5000 shares was long advertised
for, but now there will be no further ob
stacle to the sale of the property if the
owners come to Yenisei's terms. He de
mands $20 a share, or $100,000 for the
whole, and is certain to eet it.

Passing of the Storm Makes

Certain.
i _
Salute From the Philadelphia
Will Open the Festivities
This Morning.
British and American Seamen to
Mingle In the Parade on
Shore.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 21.â storm
which has been playiDg sad havoc with
the water carnival festivities for the past
two days has passed away, and, although
the atmosphere is cold to-night, the skies
are clear and all the Indications are favor
able for fair weather to-morrow.
Reports from outlying districts are that
tho storm was more severe than was at
first supposed. At Olivewood ranch, Na
tional City, fifty olive trees were uprooted
and blown down in the gale of Friday
night, some of them being thirty years of
age, the oldest in this region. Two big
cypress trees in the courthouse yard were
blown down. Throughout the county
orchards bave been more or less damaged
by high winds and washouts.
The condition of the weather now, how
ever, portends a grand success for the
carnival festivities, which open to-morrow
morning. To-day has been spent by the
4000 strangers in the city visiting the war
ships in the harbor and the various points
of interest in the city ami bay region, be
sides attending two concerts given by
Sousa's band at the opera-house.
All day the carnival committee has been
at work on the decorations on the war
ships and wharves and to-night it finds its
labors nearly completed. The baree of
the Goddess, which was nearly ruined by
the storm, has been repaired and now
presents a gorgeous and brilliant appear
ance as it floats on the bay just off the
Same Fe wharf.
The vexing question as to whether or
not the British sailors from the Oomus
would march in the parade was finally
settled to-night by the receiving from Sir
Julian Pauncefote at Washington and
Admiral Palliser, R. N., at Comox, B. C,
of messages conveying official permission
to Captain Dyke to march his men as an
armed force in the parade to-morrow
morning.
The day will open with a salute of
twenty-one guns from the Philadelphia
at sunrise in honor of Washington. At
noon the Comus will fire another salute
of twenty-one guns and in the evening
before the carnival procession starts _,
general salute wil 1 be fired by all the war
ships.

SAID SHE WAS TIRED.
Mystery Enveloping the Suicide
of Young Emma
Krenz.
The suicide of 17-year-old Emma Krenz
is still a sad mystery to her relatives
and friends, and the latter are numer
ous in the vicinity of the Five-mile
House on the Mission road. It was at the
home of her sister, Mrs. Uhlman, on
Islais street, that the girl took the fatal
dose of rough on rats which accomplished
her demise. By the inmates of the house,
her sister, her father and her brother,
only one theory is deemed tenable. "She
was out of her right mind," said her
brother. "She didn't know what she was
doing," said her brother-in-law.
Her sister, Mrs. Uhlman, expressed
great indignation at the cruel rumor
which had got abroad, supported by pub
lication in a morning paper connecting a
young man of the neighborhood with the
girl's act.
Mrs. Uhlman claimed that the girl had
no lover, and in this she was supported by
the lady with whom the unfortunate girl
had been at service. This lady declared
that the girl was quiet and industrious,
seldom going out of the house except to
Visither home or her mother's grave.
Dr. E. N. Terrello, who attended the
girl, questioned her as to the motive of
her act. She had no explanation to give
except to say, "I was tired."
The doctor considers it not unlikely that
her act was induced by a peculiar psycho
logical condition frequently met with in
youths of both sexes. This condition is a
form of melancholy which is easily aggra
vated by slight misfortunes. Miss Krenz
was described by her relatives as a rather
self-willed and independent girl. A short
time ago she expressed a desire to earn her
own living and took service with a friend
of the family. A few days later, finding it
irksome to he at the beck and call of a
mistress, she returned to her sister's home.
Here it is said she was always welcome
and her father and brother provided well
for her, but the sense of her dependence
galled her and she "was tired."
The Coroner will hold an inquest on the
remains to-morrow, but it is not expected
anything new will be developed.

First Brigade.
.SANTA* ANA, Cal., Feb. 13.â Company L,
Seventh Regiment, N. G. C, of this city, is
now fully at home in its comfortable and j
spacious new quarters on West Fourth street. ;
A five years' lease has been secured on the
building and probably there are iewcompanies â 
iii the State which have better accom mo a- !
tions than are now possessed by Orange
County's military organization. For a number
of years past the company has "bunked" on |
the upper floor of the Spurgeon bui.dinT.u-- j
ing the opera hall for drilling purposes. The
.room accessible, however, was too small for !
the constantly increasing company and the
entire building at present occupied wrs se- j ,
cured and fitted up, the boys en joying an ia- j
" formal bean bake to celebrate lis occupancy a
few nights ago. ! :
The main building is 28x65 feet, and a gym- j i
Armor/ of Company L, Stventh Regiment, N. G. C, at Santa Ana.
nasium 28xG0 feel was erected at the rear..
The armory, which occupies the full lirst floor
of the main building, Including a fully
equipped kitchen, is -pplendidly arranged, fur
nishing ample room for l< ckers. etc., and leav
ing space for banquet tables or any other re
quired room lor entertainments. Upstairs is
- large double parlor 28x28, a smoking-room
14x10, commissioned officers' room 14x14.
and llard-ioom 24x24. Adjoining the build
ing on the east a splendid parade ground has
been prepared, l',l\xll3 feet, furnishing the
best of facilities for outside dri.l?. For in
clement weather the gymnasium affords ample
drill room.
The gymnasium is supplied with nearly all
devices for am etic training, and forms one
of the most enjoyable and beneficial leatutes
of the company's equipment. Jfurizontal and
parallel bars, trapeze, rowing machine, exer
cizers. dumbbell*-, springboard, boxing gloves,
foils and other muscle-hardening devices are
in evidence on all sides, and the company's
membership includes many who are notably
proficient in the ve-rious lines of athletics.
-Th* culinary equipment is excellent, as n i
Jew ol the press representatives wno attended j
ihi' opening bean spread are fully prepared to
testify. i
There are hot, cold and shower baths, and
In fact every arrangement for health and en- â 
joyment seem, to have been anticipated in j
preparing the new quariers.

The Signal Corps, Second Brigade.
The election of Lieutenant Philip J. Perkins j
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1597.
to the captaincy of the Signal Corps to fill the '
vacancy caused by the lesignatlon of Captain
Boardman, and tne election of Corporal Leslie
Hewes to the lieu leu icy of the company,
vice Perkins, promoted, both by tne unani
mous vote of the tbirty-iour members present,
gives fatisfaction to aii those above as well
as those below the rank of the promoted
officers. Both men are very popular with
tueir command.
The members of the corps have been very
active of late acquiring proficiency in the
new code of signals, .quads go out every
Sunday practicing with fl_es.
This mor, ling the members of the corps will
go out for a practice drill, and in the afternoon
tney wi.l take part in the review on Van Ness
avenue.
The Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 21.â Owing to
the disagreeable weather the Signal Corps of
the Third Brigade has been doing but little
work with the heliograph during the past
month and are awaiting with impatience the
time when they can again go afield. At the
last drill flag work was taken up and the
members were put through a thorough course;
four stations were established in the armory
by Lieutenant Martin aud the men were kept
busy sending interesting war messages for
upward of two hours. As the members were
! not allowed so speak klov.' a whisper while at
work any mistakes made in signaling had to
\ be rectified with a flag instead of talking
j across tne hall. In accordance with general
I order No. 1, the corps has Lean ordered out on
I Washington's birthday for heliograph prac
tice. Stations will be established around the
I city and signaling will be kept ud from 1
| o'clock to 5 p. m.
The chief topic of interest among the mem
bers of the corps at the present time is the
coming pistol-shooting contest between Lieu
tenant Martin and Sergeant Bailey. Both
men are crackerjacks and about evenly
matched, but it is said that the majority of
I the corps are backing the ser.eant, although j
. there are others who think their wagers are
j safe on tbe lieutenant.
The corps headquarters have been remodeled |
and are considerably improved in appearance.
i Sergeant Martin's term has expired aud owing :
to the fact that his business takes up so much ,
! of his time it will be impossible for him to I
I re-enlist. In the retirement of Sergeant Mar
, tin the corps loses a very popular and compe
tent signalman. He has been a member of the '
corps lor the last seven years and is a general
favorite wiin his associates. His successor
; will be appointed at the next regular meeting
in March.
Within the next two months the cores will
] probably be increased to a membership of
j forty, and the boys then claim that they will
mike matters exceedingly lively for the other
corps throughout the State.
Private McCurdy, who has been an active
1 member of the corps for a long time, left last
i Tuesday to reside in Pan Francisco, and if
agreeable to the members of the Second
: Brigade Signal Corps, he will apply for a
l transfer. Arrangements bad all been com
â  pleted between Troop B, of the Cavalry, and
the Signal Corps of the Third Brigade for an
, encampment of two days, tobe held on Feb
! ruary 21 and 22, but owing to the unsettled
weather, it has been decided to postpone the
outing.
Company G's drill was very well attended on
j the 15th inst* there being over .0 ncr cent
present. The drill consisted in setting-uD ex
ercises and posting guard relief. The men are
j mora than ambitious, and are striving hard to
become one of the crack companies o: the
Stale. The non-commi.-sioie'i officers have
decided to have at least two meetings per
j mouth, at which Â«li kinds of movements will
be taken up in detail and fully discussed, and
it is thought to be a pood plan for all the com.
panics to follow, as it tends to do away with
I the bashfulness of the non-com's.
Target practice is starting up and the com-
I pany Is improving rapidly at the butts, some
, of the boys showing decided Improvement. It
is thought Dy many of the local cracks belong
ing to the companies here that if the highest
scores iv cacti month macle by the best twenty
men in each company throughout the State
were forwarded to The Call for oublication
; it would foster a spirit of rivalry and lead
to some very interesting contest!, between the
different companies.
MODESTO, CaL., Feb. 13.â As the 22d of
February has been designated a field day for
the National Guard of California, Company D,
Sixth Regiment, is to celebrate it in company
with Company H of Merced if Company H ac
cepts the invitation to be with us which has
been extended to it by our company. The
tie'.d-day observances will close with a grand
mill:. masquerade at nigut in the armory,
which will no doubt be a. success, as friends
and acquaintances of the Modesto militia from
far and wide have signified their intention of
attending.
The athletic fever has taken hold of Com
| pany D and the large stage and clubrooms are
ipÂ« ii.i.* fitted up with tne latest improved
paraphernalia of the gymnasium, and us the
privilege of the same will be allowed members
. of the company only it is expected that many
new names will be' added to th. company roll
from among the athletic element of our city.
As the range which was used last year for
target practi c is unsuitable for long-range
target practice another range has been
â elected, which will soon be ready for the
â  year's shooting.
The medals for last year's unofficial target
! prat tice are .expected to be distributed in tlie
near future. This year's target practice shows
a decided improvement on the last.
Cirt Cele.
WOODLAND. Cal., Feb. 20.â About fifty
! m'-mb-rs of Company F responded to the call
for their regular weekly drill in the new
j armory on February 19, and Captain Prindle
put the boys through a very hard drill, which
| was executed in a very creditable manner.
The drill work has recently been placed upon
I a systematic basis, and will no doubt prove
more beneficial. Regimental orders are is
j sued to the captain outlining certain drilling
to be done by the company on each even
1 lor a period of six months, thereby having all
; the companies drilled in uniformity.
During me drill last eveuing Captain Prin-
I die, assisted by Lieutenant Ward, inspected
the rifle of each member of the company.
I This is anew procedure, but the officers intend
j to make such an inspection at every drill and
see ihat the rifles .ire kept in proper-condition.
Orders have been issued to tbe members of
Company F to assemble at the armory next
Monday nt 12:30 o'clock for the usual observ
ance of Washington's birthday.
A response to the challenge of ten men of
Company Â¥ to shoot a match with ten men of
Company B. of Honolulu, is expected by "the
next steamer from the islands. . If the chal
lenge is accepted, the match will take place on
j the local ranges under the direction oi the
j captains of the two companies.
The Naval Battalion, Second Division.
Last Tuesday the Naval Battalion, Second
Division, had a drill on the Spreekels wharf.
There was a large number members present,
and the men acquitted themselves in a very
creditable mann r. The men of this branch
oi the service have since the adoption of a
lyceum system, or school of instruction and
the delivering of lectures, taken au unusual
interest in the armory, the drills and every-
thing appertaining to the service. The
attendance at meetings and drills shows a
marked increase. This is proof that when the
officers lake a lively interest in the work of
iheir command then the men become Inter
ested, with the result that a more efficient
service is secured.
To-morrow night there will be a dress parade
of the battalion on the Spreekels wharf.
This morning the battalion will be in
spected by the commander-in-chief and
the Military Committees ol the Legisla
ture on board of the Comanche. The
visitors, throu.h the courtesy of Colonel Chad
bourne ana the Harbor Commissioners, will be
Conveyed on board of the Comanche by the
tug 11. 11. Markhain. The battalion expects to
turn out r. lar*e number oi men and makes
very favorable showing. If willingness and
attention to duty will gain commendation for
lb* 1 men the members of the battalion wilt cer
tainly secure such.

SEVEN TRUSTEES
TO BE ELECTED
Members of the Mechanics'
Institute Will Vote
To-morrow.
Retiring President Denicke Dis
cusses ihe Proportional
System.
He Denies the Assertion That the
Board Is Divided and That Secret
M:tbois Obtain
The annual election of seven trustees to
serve on the board of the Mechanics' In
stitute will take place to-morrow, the
polls opening at 11 o'clock and closing at
9. Hetetofore it has been a matter for
regret that the members of the institute
have taken so little personal interest In
the question of representation. This
apathy has resulted in the board of direc
tors being almost invariably elected by an
inconsiderable percentage of those en
titled to vote, of whom there are nearly
j 5000, though, in the words of a leading
| membor, it also serves to refute the asser-
J tion of c-rtain persons that the sentiment
i of the members is seriously divided and
' that there is or has been any profound
dissatisfaction witn the management of
| the affairs of the institute.
Of the fourteen directors constituting
: the board seven will be elected to-morrow
to hold office for the next two years, and
there are fifteen aspirants for these va
cancies. Their names are: R. P. Clement,
E. H. Cole, Ernst A. Denicke, F. T.
Doolan, Ferdinand Formhals, Thomas
llou.eworth, Rodney Kendrick, C. A.
j Kern, D. A. Macdonald, John McLaren,
I EL W. Neai, L. E. Phillip*. Charles M.
| Plum Jr., J. C. Sala and Horace Wilson.
Of this number Mr. Denicke is the retiring
president, Mr. Kendrick vice-president
and Mr. Formhals ana Mr. Cole retiring
directors.
The vote will be cast on the system
known as the proportional r.nd preferen
tial, which is designed to allow minorities
to secure some represent;" ion on the
board. Thus in the present instance,
should a total of 700 votes be cast for the
seven candidates, one-sÂ» venth of that
number can elect one trustee. Prior to
15.3 the board was elected by the ordinary
method of majority voting, but in thai
year George Cumming introduced an
amendment to the constitution providing
lor ti.e adoption of the new system, and
his effort was successful.
The only attempt to draw up a ticket
for the present election was recently made
by a caucus composed of such well known
men and meiuueis as Irving M. Scott,
Hailidie, Cornwall, J. Spear, David Kerr,
and on ers, who called a nominating cau
cus and afterward issued a circular in
which the candidacy of President Den
icke, Hoaseworth, McLaren, Kendrick.
Neai, Plum and Sala was earnestly advo
cated. In every other respect the candi
dates are runniag independently and in
mutual opposition. But after all, as Mr.
I Den. eke pointed out yesterday, this very
circumstance guarantees the purity of tbe
poiiti of tne institute, because no indi
vidual candaate can commit an indiscre
tion without exposure at the hands of nis
opponents.
The element of discord periodically in
troduced by L. E. Phillips, who, it is said,
has retired from the contest, is severely
deprecated by the majority of tne present
board, as well as by the candidates them
selves.
"To refer to the action of the caucus as
an attempt to keep alive and perpetuate
the old spoils system is absurd," said Mr.
Denicke yesterday. "The nominating cau
cus was composed oi members of the very
highest standing, many of whom have
served as president of t.he institute in the
past. They are absolutely above sus
picion and would do nothing save in the
very best interests of the institute. As
far as the election itself is concerned, there
has been no disposition so far among the
candidates to indulge in recrimination.
"Recent irresponsible charges against
the conduct of the iate board are abso
lutely without foundation. . As a matter
of fact Barry, who, it was alleged, re
ceived so large a proportion of the
Mechanics" Fair printing, didn't get a
cent's worth. Mr. Presson, the head of
the printing committee, is a scrupulously
honorable as well as a. wideawake gentle
man and everybody who wishes to secure
a contract from him at any other figure
than the lowest mast rise very early in the
morning.
"It is equally absurd to say that the
Grand Army runs, the institute. It is true
that the late librarian, Mr. Wilson, and
myself both belong to the Grand Army,
but the army itself is no more powerfully
represented than any other body of citi
zens. I think 1 may say with confidence
that the interests of the institute are as
well taken care of as are those of any in
stitnte of the kind in the world.
"The facts about the late secretary's re
tirement also conclusively disprove the
assertion that the board compelled his
resignation to make room for Mr. Gum
ming Jr. Mr. Culver simply resigned to
accept a more remunerative position as
manager of the Cogswell School.
"The preferential system of voting
which obtains at our elections is an excel
lent system when all or nearly all the
members vote, but in the same proportion
as the percentage of votes cast decreases
the syst m loses its virtue. For this rea- |
son if no other, it is to be regretted that
so much apathy exists at elections,
though this shows that the members gen
erally are satisfied with the management
of the institute, and is there ore the best
refutation of the accusations against us.'
Joseph Leggett, one of the trustees, said
he was authorized to state on behalf of
R. P. Clement, one of the most popular
candidates for a vacant chair, that this
gentleman does not wish it to be thought
that Mr. Phillips is his friend or on his
side of the fence. "Mr. Clement claims, "
remarked Mr. Le.getr, with grim sar
casm, "that Mr, Phillips is trying to in
sure his defeat by posing as his supporter.
Personally, I don't propose to let Mr.
Phillips affect my feelings to the extent of
inducing me to follow Mr. Clement's ex
ample. As for the institute, there is none
better managed in the country, and I
speak from five years' experience." *
THE PARK WAS CROWDED.
Trapes- Performance by an Aeronaut
While High in Air.
The park and ocean beach were crowded
yesterday with fine equipages, cyclers and
pedestrians. The weather having been
unpropitious for several Sundays, nearly
everybody was behind on outing pleas
ures, and so hastened to make up for lost
time. Among the teams was a magnifi
cent six-in-hand of browns.

WON'T HAVE TO PAY RENT
Labor Exchangers Will Build
Houses for All Their
Members.
A Brick Kiln Startedâ -New Enter
prises Inaugurated Every Week.
Extending Rapidly.
The Hon. Green Majors spoke to and
for the Labor Exchange at the public
meeting held at Pythian Hall, 909 Market
street, yesterday afternoon.
He was introduced by J. S. Clark, the
State organizer of the exchange, who, in a
preliminary address, said the financial
system of States and nations of the world
was not merely responsible for the hard
times, but for all the mental and moral
obliquity of the world. Tbis financial
system had "wound us up," and it was
the province and the mission of the Labor
Exchange to "unwind us" without regard j
to politics or waiting for the' heavy and j
refractory machinery of the Government.
"It is a business matter," he said,
"wherein every man will, upon coming to
understand it, immediately see it to his
interest to Join with the movement.
Among the first great strides it will take
toward the emancipation of men is to re
lieve them from the necessity of paying
rent." l-teWMI.-jtal
He explained that this was to be ac
complished through the building of
houses for the member?, the start being
made through those who had land de
positing it with the exchange.
A man in the audience wanted to know
how this could be done. "Suppose 1 have
a house built," he said, "and not wishing
to occupy it myself and some other brother
does wish to occupy it. would he not have
to pay rent?" he inquired.
"Well, you know," said Clark, "we pro
pose to build a bouse for the brother also."
lowing the applause that this provoked
Clark explained that this could not be done
ail at once.
"There is not a week passes, however,"
he said, "but that some enterprise is begun
under the auspices of the exchange, some
industry started or some new avenue
opened up enlarging the horizon, the area
of usefulness and potency of the new sys
tem. Just in proportion as this growth
and development is made, so the exchange
acquires stability and the Labor Exchange
check extends its circle of operation."
Another meeting will be held next Sun
day afternoon at the same place.

A Monument In veil p.l.
A beautiful marble monument erected by
Mrs. William E. Meadows to the memory of
her beloved husband who died by accident a
year ago was unveiled at Cyprus Lawn Ceme
tery yesterday afternoon. Various fraterni
ties to which he belonged were represented by
a number of members who came to pay their
last tribute of respect to one whom all held in
high esteem. The services were conducted by
the Rev. J. S. David of the Swedenborg Mis
sion Society of this City. After an appropriate
address the monument was solemnly unveiled
while the "Kock of Ages" was being sung, led
by the Daughters of Sl. George. This was fol
lowed by prayer and the singing of the hymn
"Sweet by and by," closing with the benedic
tion.
NEVADA FIGHTERS
TO BE CENSURED
Loyal Irishmen Say That It
Desecrates St. Patrick's
Day.
A Committee WiU .Indorse the
"Monitor's" Denunciation
of the Fight.
Progress Mad. by the St. Patrick's
Day Convention Which Met
Yesterd y.
The St. Patrick's day convention was in
session all yesterday afternoon at K. R. B.
Hall, and considerable progress was made
toward shaping the celebration in such a
way that it wilt be a success.
Incidentally, during the afternoon there
was considerable heated discussion rel
ative to the Nevada prize-right, when a
resolution was proposed censuring the
managers for desecrating the festival day
of Ireland's patron saint by having a
prize-fight on that day.
Another proposition lhat elicited con
siderable discussion was an attack on the
Monitor because it has not been advertis
ing the proposed celebration, but the pa
per found many warm defenders and all
attempts to censure it were futile.
The committee on talent reported pro
gress and was granted another week in
which to select the orator. The names of
Geo.ee Gallagher and David Costello were
added to the committee. It was alsK) de
cided that the committee on arrange
ments shall hereafter meet every Tuesday
nieht at Hibernla Hall, 120 Ninth street
There was considerable discussion on
printing and advertising, and it wa. de
cided to bill the City thoroughly and pos
sibly extend the same method of adver
tising elsewhere, particularly in adjacent
towns.
R. O'Reilly wanted a committee ap
pointed to notify ths Monitor that there
will be a St. Patrick's day celebration in
this City.
Several delegates thought the Monitor
had not treated the convention right, but
a number defended the paper and the
matter was reterred to the press com
mittee.
Delegate Gildea and others eulogized the
Monitor and its editor and assured the
convention that the paper would do its
Dart at the proper time.
Jerome Deasy was in favor of following
the Monitor's advice in condemning the
Corbett-Fitzsimmons prize-fight as a dese
cration of St. Patrick's day. He intro
duced a resolution that five be appointed
as a committee 'â > formulate the conven
tion's views on the fight.
A spirited discussion followed. Dele
gate Daniel Nichols .aid: "X want to be
honest, gentlemen, and 1 think I should
like to see the prize-fight ii I could afford
it. I believe there's many a heart here
that would Dp glad if the big Irishman
would win, and 1 think it's none of our
business at all.
"It's an affair in another State alto
gether, and we've got enough to do to
take care of St. Patrick here rather than
to be going to some other State and med
dle in its affairs." pflnSÃ
Mr. Deasy â We ought to have the man- ;
lines-* to condemn this thing, as tbe Moni- j
tor sugeested. Prize-fights are on a par j
with horse races and other forms of Gam
bling, and this is no way to celebrate the ;
day.
Delegate Flynnâ A prize-fi_ht is one ;
thing and a prize-fight on "St. Patrick* 1
day is another. Ninety per cent of the ;
people will agree with the Monitor, and I ;
am lor the resolutions.
A motion to indefinitely postpone the !
matter was lost and Mr. Deasy's resolution !
carried. The following were appointed to '
draw resolutions on the subject: Deasy,
Donovan, Gildea, Conklin and Fiynn.
Nicholas was appointed, but he declined ;
to act, saying he was unalterably for the i
fight, "and if your commitceo censures it
you'll get into a battle 01 argument with |
me on this lloor."
Delegate Donovan will try to take
care of the gentleman in any argument !
that may arise.
Three of the five committeemen are in
favor of the Monitor's position and their
resolution, will at least censure the fight
for desecrating the day.
Just after the committee was appointed.
Rev. Father James McFadden was in- I
vited to soeak. He thought the conven- j
tion ought to follow the Monitor's advice 1
and condemn the fight.
The convention cheered him and agreed â¢
to aid him in his lecture at Metropolitan j
Temple, on the night of March 10.
The prize-fight question ana other mat- !
ters will come be tore the convention at I
K. R. B. Hall, at 2:30 next Sunday.

As Mark Hanna is reported to have said ;

It is universally agreed that Washington

The Cubans are so sanguine of success

The Nevada prize-fight law should be

Bourke Cockran's statement that he is

Despite the fact that Cleveland placed

Washington hotel-keepers are already

The Chicago Inter Ocean says: "There
are in Chicago a dozen people who could
afford the monetary outlay of the Bradley
Martin ball, but there is not one who
could afford to brave the derisive laughter
that the essay would evoke." This is the
first time on record that Chicago pluto
crats have ever been charged with a lack
of nerve and collapse of gall.
That there is plenty of money to be
earned by anybody who has the skill, to
invent a new way of earning lt is made
evident by the report that a woman in
London has made a great success by or
ganizing an association to give women
advice about how to dress. The advice
given is much cheaper than that furnished

however, that only the first and the last
of these charges are anywhere within gun
shot of the truth.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
It is a cheeWul sign of upward tendencies in American life that the observance of
j George Washington's birthday is becoming more general with the passing years.
I That it is the birthday of Washington rather than the date of some great event in his
I career, or than that of his death, which has been .elected for commemora
tion is significant of our American character, in that it chooses to
hail the future with i hope rather than remember the past with
j either pride or tears. The birthday of Washington has been made the symbol of the
j birthday of liberty in the New World, and his life has come to stand as the archtype
of our development as a Nation, and of our hope as a people apart and contrasted
i with those of our own extraction existing under other forms of law.
There is, perhaps, no other American whose life history has been more closely
scanned than that of Washington for tacts whicn would either increase or lessen his
regard in the minis of his countrymen. Every episode of his youtn, every incident
;in his early military career, every event in the record of the revo
! lution, every fact in connection with his official service, every circumstance
Jof his private life, has been put to the microscopic test. The
! result has been only an increase of public reverence and esteem. That "the great
I Virgianian kept slaves," Wendell Phillips, when it suited his purpose, did not hesitate
Ito .ay; that he swore at the retreating Lee at Monmouth, the faithful
I biographer has not failed to record; that he had some of the minor
blemishes of other men is freely conceded. But these things only increase
our human estimate of the measure of Washington, the man. Taken as a whole he
stands as the most perfect type of what the American people having produced in the
individual, may reasonably hope to realize in general under the blessings of liberty
as ordained, established and protected by American law.
Upon the banks of the Potomac, in the city of his name, elands the Washington
j monument, the loftiest human structure on the continent, and in its grand simplicity
l the most perfect of ail. To the construction cf its interior the quarries of every State
in tbe Union have contributed their stone. Tnere is a thought in this more subtle
probably than the idea of the architect who suggested the contribution. The
character of Washington, though lofty and grand, was formed of elements which are
not at all exceptional or unique, but like the stones in his monument, are but samples
of yet unquarried qualities in the character of the American people; qualities which
are being developed and utilized in the granite and marble framework of the constitu
tion and society of every State in the Union as the centuries come and pass.
THE ARBITRATION TREATY.
The refusal of the Senate to consider the
arbitration treaty with sufficient favor to
lix a day for taking the vote at this ses
sion, despite the urgency of Senator Sher
man, is^an evidence that the majority of
the Senate are opposed to the measure in
its present shape and intend to either rad
ically amend it or reject it altogether.
There is reason to believe that many of
the Senators wish to make the treaty sub
ject to the Nicaragua canal bill and will
not enter upon any agreement of arbitra
tion with Great Britain until such ar
rangements have been made concerning
the canal as will insure its control by the
United States.
The action of the advocates of the canal
in opposing the adoption of the arbitra
tion treaty is not the result of any purely
J jingo motive, nor is the outcome of condi
tions peculiar to this time. Those who
j think that the opposition to the treaty is
due mainly to the antagonism of Sena
tors to President Cleveland take a very
inadequate view of the subject. It is to
be noted that the opposition has been
made to Senator Sherman as well as to
Secretary Olney, and it is known that Mr.
Sherman is to be Secretary of Stat during
the next administration. It is very clear,
therefore, that antagonism to the bill is
not due to any dislike of a particular ad
ministration, but is founded upon the con
ditions of the treaty itself.
More than fifteen years ago James G.
â  Blame, then Secretary of State, sent a
p dispatch to James Russell Lowell, at that
time our Minister to England, instructing
him to inform the British Government j
that the United States could not consent
to any kind of treaty which would give
to that or any other nation an equal con
trol with the United States over the Nic
aragua canal. In the course of this dis
patch Mr. Blame; said:
It a hostile movement should at any time
be made against the Pacific Coast, threaten
ing danger to its people and destruction to
its property, the Government of the United
states would feel that it had been unfaithful
to its duty and neglectful toward its own citi
zens if it had permitted itself to be bound by
a treaty which gave the same right through a
canal to a warship bent on an errand of de
struction, that is reserved for its own navy,
! sailing for the defence of our coast and the
j protection of the lives ol our people. And as
j England insists by the might of her power
that her enemies in war shall strike her Indian
j possessions only by doubling the Cape of Good
Hope, so the Government of the United States
will equally insist that the interior, more
speedy and safer route of the canal snail be
reserved for ourselves, while our enemies, if
we shall ever be so unfortunate as to have any,
shall be remanded to the voyage around Cape
Horn.
It will be seen from the statements of i
this dispatch that the Nicaragua canal
scheme and the relation to it of any and
all treaties which may be made between
this country and other nations has long
been a subject of consideration by the
statesmen of the Senate. The issue is
not a new one to them, as it is to Secre
tary Olney. Administrations come and
administrations go, but the Senate re
mains forever.
It is one of the strong points of our
form of government that our foreign re
lations are largely entrusted to this per
manent and enduring body of statesmen.
It is only by reason of the fact that the
Senate is charged with this power that we
have bad in the past, or could have in the
future, any such thing as an established
foreign policy. Those, therefore, who are
most in favor of the arbitration treaty
should pause before they condemn the
Senate for declining to accept it in its
present form, or possibly in any form at
the present time. Let us first make sure
of our supremacy over the waterway
across the isthmus beforo we enter upon
treaties which might bind as in honor to
submit our domination of that canal to
the arbitration of a foreign power.
INDIAN GRIEVANCES.
One result of the outbreak of famine and
plague in India promises to be beneficial
to the people of the country. The dire |
calamities which have befallen them have j
called public attention to everything con
cerning India, and have led men of
prominence in England to give considera
tion to the requests which have come from j
that country for changes and amendments i
in the system of government.
For several years past there has been an
annual meeting at Calcutta of an assembly
calling itself the Indian National Congress.
This assembly is made up of natives of in
telligence and energy from all the prov
inces of the great empire, and the discus
sions held are directed to the end of ob
taining redress for grievances which are
felt under British rule. At all of these
meetings resolutions have been passed of
the same general character, but until the
present time they have been almost
ignored by the governing classes in Eng
j land. The famine and the plague, how
ever, have aroused the interest of the
British public, and there no ** seems
reason for believing that the people of
Great Britain will demand of Parliament
tbat something be done in the way of
redress.
According to the Calcutta Congress tbe
famine now afflicting the people has been
due largely to the great drain of wealth
resulting from excessive taxation. Com
plaint is made of the bureaucratic tend
enciesand over-centralized administration
of the government, and it is farther as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, IS9T.
'erted that much of the legislation enacted
by the British Council is unfitted for ap
plication in India, because it legislates
over the heads and beyond the immediate
needs of a people still wedded to old
tradition, custom and law.
The truth of the resolutions adopted by
the congress is confirmed by Lord Rob
erts, who from his long experience in India
as commander of the British array there is
well versed in the affairs of the country.
He has warned the people of Great Britain
that unless the grievances of India are re
dressed and a newer and better system of
government provided their hold upon the
country will be seriously shaken. While
much has been done for India and her
people by the building of canals and rail
ways, the burden of taxation laid upon
them to carry out these great designs has
been more onerous than they can bear.
They now demand through their annual
congresses a larger share in the adminis
tration of the country, and it seems that
unless they obtain it there will be trouble
ahead.
It is this newly awakened consideration
of Indian claims on the part of many lead
ing papers and men of influence in Great
Britain that give-, a ray of hope to the sit
uation, and promises that the famine and
the plague may prove in the end to be
benefits to the long - oppressed people.
Their disasters have excited commisera
tion ana caused a sympathetic study of
their conditions. They have therefore
better prospects than ever before of ob
taining relief, and it is to be hoped the
promises will not prove deceptive or their
fulfillment be too lon,, delayed.
IMMIGEATION PROBLEMS.
Secretary Olney has recently received a
letter from the famous novelist, Louise de
la Ramee, better known as "Ouiua," rela
tive to the immigration bill, in which she
protests against the barring out of immi
grants who cannot read. She states that
if we exclude Italians who cannot read
we will shut out the best and most labori
ous part of tho population and will admit
the trash of cities.
The peasantry of Italy, she informs the
Secretary of State, are almost entirely
illiterate. She has had many men in her
employ during her residence in Italy and
has invariably found those who could not
read ten times more industrious, temper
ate and honest than those "corrupted by
the trumpery education of the schools."
She has, she asserts, an old man in her
service who can be sent with fifty com
missions to purchase articles with only
oral instructions, and be will execute the
order without forgetting a single detail.
Such a man, she says, we would turn
from our shores, while a currupt youth
able to read would be admitted.
This argument from "Ouida" might at
first thought make the restriction of im
migration seem a folly, but it really shows
a reason why a restriction should be made
still more stringent. There are good rea
sons for shutting out the illiterate; there
are better reasons for shutting out the
literate corrupt, but practicability cuts a
great figure in the case, and it is much
easier to prove a man is illiterate than
that he is immoral or dishonest.
Perhaps some time in the future the can
didates for admission to the opportunities
of this country may be required to pro
duce certificates of good conduct for years
preceding their application for entry. By
such requirements this wonderful land of
ours would become a sort of paradise in a
moral as well as a material sense. Such a
policy of exclusion would be a practical
illustration of the reward that awaits on
well doing, and would furnish an incen
tive to the enterprising youth of Europe
to equip themselves in mind and charac
ter so as to be found worthy of admission
to American opportunities and American
citizenship. ,

this spring. This bean makes a good growth
in Butte County soil, yields bountifully, and
not only brings a good price in the market,
but besides its popularity for table nse it
makes a valuable food for horses and cattle.
Horses and cattle like it seemingly as well as
corn, oats or barley, and, it is claimed, the
milch cows fed on this food produce more and
richer milk than when fed on cereals. Unlike
the ordinary bean the Winsor variety grows
onastright stalk to a height of from two to
three feet. The beans mature in pods, which
spring forth from the stalk, and olten as many
as eight beans are produced in one pod. Mr.
Grant will probably have several hundred
tons yield of this crop for the next market."
Berkeley has come to the front as a candi
date for the bay terminus of the Valley road.
The Herald of the university town expatiates
on the matter thus: '-Is there any reason why
this town should not get the lirst benefits to
come from the building of the Valley road to
the bay of San Francisco?
"The portion of Berkeley on the bay is such
that a great city can be built here without
reference to Oakland, or even to San Fran-
Cisco. We are situated soma five miles from
Oakland and have some three miles of water
front that can be made available for com
merce.
"Too certainty of the extension of that road
should move every property-owner to take
steps to prepare for the event.
"Tnere will be a meeting called of the
larger property-owners of the town at a very
early date to formulate some proposition that
can be presented to the directors ol the Val
ley road. It is believed that Berkeley can
easily furnish all of the rights of way and ter
minal facilities free of cost to the road,
besides raising at least $100,000 bonus in
cash."
The Watsonville Pajaronian. in its last Is
sues, imparts the following information of in
terest to horticulturist.: "Last fall the Beile
-11 .ur apples from some sections of this valley
showed red spots, and tnis discoloration af
fected their sale. Packers and orchardists
claimed tbat the spot was due to heavy fogs
followed by warm weatherâ that the spots
were blisters. When Professor Wickson was
here on the Gth inst. he was shown apples
with these spots, and on his return to Berke
ley he examined them closeley. He reports as
follows: 4 The apples with red spots are af
fected with a fungus like the shot-hole fungus
of tne apricot, but not the same species proba
bly. It can be prevented by spraying with cop
per carbonate solution as per our bulletin 115.
This should bo used when the lruit is nearly
ripe, just belore the time when the spots begin
to develop. Itis used in preference to Bor
deaux mixture, because it will not stain the
fruit. The scale on the apple* sent is uot San
Jose scale, but of a closely allied species. Tbe
lime, salt and sulphur wash is as good for this
as for San Jose scale.' Now that our fruit-
Krowersare informed as to the cause and rem
edy for the red spot lhey can do much toward
removing it. Tho scale re-erred to is what was
charged to be San Jose scale, and appeared ln
old orchards. The wash recommended is said
to be a sure shot."

Tne firms of Earl, Napier and Thames Iron
Works lost heavily on some ship contracts
seven years ago, the last-named firm claiming
to be the loser of $500,000 on the Blenheim,
Grafton and Theseus. The claim was made
five years ago for extra compensation because
of neglect of the officials, but not until quite
recently has the Admiralty consented to listen
to the contractors' grievances and the chances
of the latter to recover their claims are said to
be very good.
The naval programme of Japan, according
to the Mainichi Snimtun, provides for an ex
penditure of 213,100,962 yen (one yen equal

vast sum 126,047,975 yen is for ships, 66.927,
--491 yen for armament and 20.125, for im

programme embraces four battle-ships of
15,140 tons each, six first-class cruisers ol
9000 each, three second-class cruisers of 4850
tons; two third-class cruisers of 3200 tons,
three torpeao gunboats of 1200, one torpedo
depot ship of 6750 tons, eleven torpedo-boat
destroyers and eighty-nine torpedo-boats. 2 * If
this plan is carried to completion Japan will
have a fleet nine .years hence consisting of
sixty-seven ships, aggregating 257,100 tons
displacement, eleven torpedo-boat destroyers
and 115 torpedo-boats. In the late war with
China Japan captured ten ships of 15,055

The Jeaurreguiberry ana Carnot, recently com
pleted, are samples of contract and dockyard
work. They are armored ships of about 12,000
tons, the first being built by contract at La
Seyne. The Carnot was. built at the Toulon
dockyard. On the trial trip the oontract-bullt
ship performed to satisfaction and the changes
and requisite repairs were insignificant. The
Carnot, on thÂ« other hand, drew much moro
water than intended and it was discovered she
had only breathing space for one-quarter of
the crew she was to carry. The constructors
added a superstructure to accommodate the
crew, which resulted in the ship becoming
dangerously top-heavy, so she wai taken back
to Toulon with the Jeaurreguiberry to be
finally fitted for sea. It seems from subsequent
developments that the constructors delayed
work on the latter ship In order to push- the
Carnot forward, and the Minister of Marine
lost patience and relieved three constructors
from duty and turned the work over to others
LAW AND SECOND MARRIAGES.
Albany Argus-
A young widow in France whose husband
left her all bis property on condition that she
should forfeit the whole, except dower, if she
married again, was inclined to contract a new
marriage, and prudently went to the local
court to see if there were any escape. It up
held the will, but a higher court to which the
question was. taken then reversed the decision
on novel grounds. The Judges there said that
celibacy, being contrary to nature, was some
thing which no man, alive or dead, had a
right to Impose, and . that such an act, par
ticularly in a country like France, where the
population is stationary or waning, was con
trary to pnblle policy. Upon. this the wiaow
married, but it seems she was too hasty after
all, for relatives carried the case up to the Su
preme Court, which unga.lantly reaffirmed
the original opinion. This French decision
agrees with the! law in this country, and, we
believe, ln England. Conditions in restraint
of marriage are generally held to be void, but
there are exceptions to the rule, and one of
these exceptions is ia the case of a second
marriage.
"TRANSIT MARKS" FOR THE COAST.
An important aid to navigation, by which
mariners alone the Pacific coast may readily
determine the deviation of their compasses, is
likely to be afforded soon by the Chamber of
Commerce, Shipowners' Association and the
marine underwriters, acting on the recom
mendation of Alfred and Edmund McNevin,
tons of the late Captain McNevin, and masters
of the McNevin School of Navigation. It is
proposed that at suitable points along the
coast, from San Diego to Puget Sound, and es
pecially about the shores of the principal har
bors, two prominent points which can be
brought conveniently within range from deep
â¢rater be taken and the true magnetic bearing

as "Transit Marks."
of the lino between them determined and
made known, so that a commander may easily
compare the bearing of his compass needle
therewith. Tbis is something that has been
carefully done by Governments, boards of trade
and nautical bodies of Europe, but this valu
able safeguard is here being seriously consid
ered for the first time.
A ship's compass ie its navigator's mcst im
portant guide, and upon the minute correct
ness of the ship's bearing, as told by the com
pass, there often depends the chances of safety
and disaster. If in the night or the fog the
bearing of the needle and hence of the ship is
a fraction of a point out of the way, the vessel
may strike the reef or the point which
she is steered to clear. The compass
needle rarely points truly on board ship and
it is necessary to know constantly the varia
tion and the allowances to be made for it.
Tne swerving of the needle from the true
magnetic north depends. upon different things,
and, according to tho cause, is called "varia
tion." "deviation" and "local attraction."
Variation is due to the earth's magnetic cur
rents, and being constant in one locality is
known and itis given on the charts. Local
attraction is due to the close presence of large
bodies of iron and is temporary.
Deviation is due to the iron of the shlD or
its cargo, and must be known for each vessel.
This deviation varies, too, with the ship's
bearing or position. When the ship points
north the needle is affected by the ship's iron
differently from what It is when the ship
points east or south. The deviation must be
known, then, for different bearings of the
ship. As a little iron near the compass may
affect the deviation, the deviation should be
known at each sailing. It is supposed that
the late wreck of the steamer Humboldt was
due ln part to compass deviation. At the in
vestigation the captain testified that the com
pass might have been wrong, for there were a
lot of butter boxes piled on deck, and '.he iron
in them might have affected the needle. Had
the captain of the Humboldt been able to
easily squint along the line between the shot
tower and some steeple on leaving port and
compared his compass bearing with the known
bearing of that line, the Humboldt might not
have been lost. SHH
The captains of the big ocean-going steam
ers and of deep-water vessels keep careful
track of their compass deviation by the occa
sional calculation of an azimuth or ampli
tude or an observation with a polarus, but the
navigators of coast vessels ignore deviation to
a great extent, depend on observations of
shores and lights and take chances for the
rest. Many coasting captains are not experts
on azimuths, anyway.
By the plan proposed a very simple observa
tion readily taken would enable any coasting
captain to determine the deviation of his
compass, and that knowledge would be an
other element of safety to him. It would be a
convenience valuable to every mariner who
approaches the coast. In Europe and other
countries mountain peaks, rocks, tall chim
neys, church spires and beacons erected, for
the purpose are used. What is wanted is two
permanent objects for "transit marks," the
farther apart the better.
About the harbor of San Francisco spires
and all sorts of prominent objects about the
shore, islands and distant hills would be
taken and along the coast at suitable points,
where hills rise some distance back of the
shore, natural objects or large posts would be
use*-. ' The location, description and true mag
netic bearing of these pairs of objects would
be given to mariners just as buoys, lights, etc.,
are now given. In the harbors these points
would come into line as the vessels swung
with the wind and tide, and at sea a captain
could heave his ship to for the brief observa
tion.
A few hundred dollars or so would provide
these aids to navigation from San Diego to
Puget Sound. Messrs. McNevin have ad
dressed a letter to the Shipowners' Associa
tion, which will be considered at the next
meeting and it will also com. before the
Chamber of Commerce.

lOth of January, when Leleud Stanford was
inaugurated as Governor, another flood visited
the city and on the next day the Senate by a
vote of 20 to .13 adopted a concurrent resolu

-Tate Flowersâ M. N., City. The Legis

diii not adopt a State flower for California, al
though a bill to make the eschsclioltzia tha
State flower was introduced: bat the legis
lators were too busy with other matters to
give any time to sentiment. The following
are the State flowers as adopted, in most in
stances, by the votes of the public school
scholars of the respective States: Alabama,
golden rod; Colorado, columbine; Delaware,
peÃch blossom; Idaho, syrmgia; lowa, rose;
Maine, pine cone and " tassel; Minnesota,
cypripodium, or moccasin flower; Montana,
bitter root; Nebraska, golden rod; New York,
rose; North Dakota, wild rose; Oklahoma
(Territory), mistletoe; Oregon, golden rod;
Utah, .ego lily, and Vermont, red clover. Tha
flowers oi Utaii and Vermont were adopted by
the Legislature of each State, and not by tho
school children. An attempt was made in
1896 to hold a National convention at Asbe
ville, N. C, to determine on a National flower
to recommend to Congress for adoption; but
as there were but seven States represented it
was decided to adjourn the convention, which
met on the 22d of October, until some future
time, when a larger number of representa
tives may be secured. An Informal caucus of
the delegates, mostly from the South and
East, showed a piei'erence lor the columbine
as the National flower. The secretary ol thia

;j=.'ip.;< p., _â Â»
The Norwegian bark Nordlyset is in a
peculiar predicament. She went to Oak
land Creek to discharge the remainder of
her coal cargo, and then Captain Olsen
dropped upstream with .ho tide in order
to save wharfage and await the arrival of
a tug. Yesterday the Reliance was sent
out to tow him into the bay, but Captain
"Gil" Brocka**/ found that he could not
get within five cables' length of the ves
sel. He backed the tug up into the mud
and came near to getting his own vessel
hard and fast In his endeavors to reach
the bark. Finally he gave up the attempt
and returned to the City.
When Nordlyset began to drift with
the tide she was living light. When the
anchor was dropped she was in seven feet
of water, and not one of the big company's
tugs can reac.i her even at high water.
About the only tug that can handle her is
the Ida W., and the chances are that Cap
tain Dan James will have the job of haul
ing her out to-day. From here the bark
will be towea to Port Costa, where she
will load wheat for youth Africa.
The American ship W. F. Babcock
cleared for Honolulu in ballast yesterday.
At the latter port she will loau sugar for
New York. Captain and Mrs. Graham
had a host of friends down to sen them off
and wish them bon voyage. The big tug
Fearless took the ship out, and they made
a pretty sight passing out through the
Golden Gate.
Two daring burglars were arrested on
the water front yesterday morning.
James Hanley and Thomas Johnson
| (alias Gus Anderson) broke into the caoin
j of the tug Columbia, and attempted to
i rifle the lockers whi.e the captain was
asleep. They even had the audacity to
light a lamp and go about their work in a
methodical manner. They were surprised
to find the captain aboard, and when he
awoke they ran. The captain gave chase,
and a hue and _ry followed.
Offii ers Geor c Lake and C. M. James
and Special Officer James Green inter
cepted the iugitives, and placed them un
der arrest. At the Harbor Police Station
they were charged with burglary. John
son or Anderson has just been released
from the State's prison, while Haniey bad
a considerable quantity of opium on his
person, and a letter written by a friend of
his who is now in San Quentin. Both men
are old offenders, aud many of the rob
beries on the front are laid to their ac
count by the police.
The steamer Empire put back yesterday
and landed the carpenter. The vessel was
caught in the rollers on the bar and O.sen
was thrown into tne scuppers and broke
his leg. The fracture was a very bad one,
the bone being forced through" ide skin.
The steamer docked at the seawall and the
ambulance was sent for. The doctors at
Receiving Hospital seemed to think that
Olsen may lose his leg. The Empire went
to sea again after landing the carpenter.
The new steamer Humboldt will go on the
Merchants' drydock to-morrow to get her
propeller on. After that sbe will be newly
cleaned and painted and will probably
make her trial trip the first week in March.
She is one of the prettiest mo lels afloat,
and if she does not make a record on her

will be very disappointed.
FUNDS RAISED FOR CRETE
The Greeks Nobly Respond to
the E cqu.nt Appeals of
Orators
F.ur Hun.red anl Eighty.Five Dol
lars Sub.cribed at Last Night's
Meeting.
For two hours last night Greek orators
hurled philippics at the Ottoman tyrant
in sonorous periods reminiscent of Demos
thenes, while an enthusiastic audience
punctuated their delivery with many
"zetos" for Greece, for Crete and the
United Slates of America. Nor did the
feeiing of the meeting confine itself to de
nunciation of the insensate recluse cf the
lildiz Kiosk or mere expressions of
sympathy for the Cretan sufferers. The
now of Attic and other eloquence had
scarcely ceased wh n D. Vsalaritos, a
horny-handed sen of toil, came to the
front and donated *2 to the relief fund.
His example was immediately fol
lowed, and in less than twenty minutes
sixty or seventy Greeks subscribed the
sum of $485, which will probably run into
four figuies after the national ball of the
27th inst.
The meeting was held' in the Druids'
Hall on Sutter street, and A. J. Kosta
presided. The stars and stripes and the
Grecian standard were suspended midway
from the walls on eith-r side of the hall,
and their folds almost met in the center.
The principal speakers were Professor
Albin Putzker of Berkeley, N. Damia-
V, a m ' Â°* Demetrak, the president of the
Hellenic Society, P. Vrettos. M. D Van
vales and A. J. Kosta.
Professor Puizlcer, who addressed the
meeting in Greek, advised his hearers to
study their own history, realize it. signifi
cance and understand the manner in
which Turkey has abased its rule in Crete
The publication of these facts will arouse
universal sympathy among Americans for
Crete and Greece in their hour of peril
Crete, he said, deserved more sympathy
than Cuba, inasmuch as while Cuba was a
Catholic country ruled by a Catholic power
Crete was a Christian country ruled by a
Mohammedan power. .Even if the Greeks
had no money they could arouse this
practical sympathy by legitimate and
honest means, by which the European
powers might be made to recognize the
extent of the feeling in America. Event
ually, he concluded, such influences might
tend to the union of Greece and Crete.
C. Demetrak spoke of the local effort be
ing made to raise funds to succor the Cre
tan sufferers, and stated that the money
would soon be forwarded for distribution.
The Greeks in San Francisco, he said, had
come here to stay, but now that their
country needed assistance they were
bound to return and fight in her cause.
The world at large owed a debt of grati
tude to Greece for much of the knowledge
of the present day, which found its source
in the philosophy of Plato, Aristotle and
Socrates. So now, he contended, tbeir
country had a right to look to the civil
ized world for assistance against the Turk
in part payment of that debt. Lord By
ron, he reminded his hearer?, formerly
fought for Greece in 1821 and his example
should be emulated by ail lovers of free

(strong arm of the soldier devoted to the
cause was of more value than money;
Vrettos described the conditions prevail
ing in Crete, and Damianakis outlined the
present situation of Europe and the atti
tude toward Greece.
An eleeant supper, provided by Mr.
Kosta, was subsequently partaken of,
when the flowing bowl passed around and
the assembled guests drank to the healtn
and prosperity in the mother country and
the confusion of tier enemies.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Velodrome Race Meet Xo-Da**â Becker's
Phenomenal 1 ive-^lle Perform
ance Yesterday
The only cycling event scheduled for to
day is the meet at the Velodrome this after
noon. There is a fair programme, the
riders are in good shape, and fast time
should be the rule.
W. Â£. decker of Minneapolis, who has
been riding here for some time now, seem,
to have a penchant for live-mile perform
ances. Not content with holding the
National and coast championships at that
distance, he is constantly trying to lower
his own records. Yesterday afternoon at
the Velodrome he rode it in 10:17, his best
time so far. He was paced by several
tandem teams and a triplet, and seemed
at the finish almost as strong as when he
started. Becker will ride at the meet to
day and is a likely winner.
The quadruplet was out in the park yes
terday manned by Kroetr, Dixon, Vincent
and Saunders, and attracted a good deal
of attention. The day was beautiful and
hundreds of wheelmen were on the drives
and cycle paths. In spite of the recent
heavy rains the roads are in excellent con
dition.
E. E. Stoddard left last night for an ex
tended trip through the Northwest and
will be away about two months. Wilbur
Knapp is expected home from his Eastefh
trip this week.
it. W. Burris, president "of the Santa
Rosa Wheelmen, is in the City, the guest
of the Bay City Wheelmen. He nr* they
expect to hold the biggest meet in the
history of Santa Rosa next Saturday.
The entry list includes all the cracks now
training at San Jose, besides those at the
Velodrome.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Several Interesting Games Played, Al
though the irackerjacks Were
Absent.
The San Francisco handball court was
crowded yesterday, and, although the
crackerjacks were absent, there were sev
eral interesting games played.
M. M. McNeil and George McDonald
played against Phil Ryan and Dan Rod
gers. They are all "heavy-weights and
experienced players. Ryan and Rodgers
thought they could play all round the
other team, as they had defeated McDon-
aid and R. Shea, but the result was a
â â¢devious disappointment to them, McNeil
and McDonald winning by three games to
one.
A rattling game was played between J.
Collins and Ed Toy and D Connollv and
George Hutchinson. Collins and" Toy,
wtio represented the new blood, won
easily in three straight games.
A lew games with the soft ball were
played in the Union court, but no scores
were kept.
Following were the games played in the
San Francisco court:

SAYS NEVADA'S
STAR IS DARKENED
Rev. Dr. Boynton's Opinion
of the Fight at
Carson.
Some Scathing Words at the
Action of the Sagebrush
Legislature.
Sensational Prelude to a Sermon at
the First Baptist
Church.
Rev. Dr. M. P. Boynton of the First
Baptist Church, in a prelude to his ser
mon last nieht, spoke of the legalizing of
pugilism in Neva as follows:
The blue of our flag is thickly studded by
gleaming stars that bespeak a sisterhood of
States that in company nave been striving for
better life and truer light, and this march to
& higher morality has been wa.ched with
earnest solicitude on the part of all good
citizens. â¢
One blot after another has been washed
away, until we had hoped that the cleaning
would goon until by bonds of purity we stood
united as a Nation. There has been cordial
sympathy Detween the States. The battle has
been a common one. Each was interested lor
all, and all for each. Rut suddenly we are
called to attend the itinera, of one ol the fam
ily; a sister has fallen, has committed moral
suicide. The poor girl was very poor, having
lost much of ncr wealth; her people had
moved away, her commercial life was at low
ebb, and, being desperate, she sold herself to
the abomination that li d been rejected by all
other States in the Qui .
Itis cause for than., that the sagebrush,
arid plains and barren mountains abound an
people are so scarce. The evil will not do the
damage that would be done were tbe State
more thickly populated.
So closely related are we as a Nation that
the disgrace of one Is the shame 01 all. The j
tilth cast by Nevada s Legislature upon the
skirts of Colombia scents with its polluting
odor the Whole raiment of the Goddess of Lib-
erty. /
lt is to be regretted that we have not Federal
laws that would cover such cases and arrest
thedownlall ot a sovereign State. The obli
gation owed the whole Nation by Nevada has
been trampled In the dust for a few unclean
dollars. The sack of gold she thus obtains will
prove a millstone about her neck to drag her
down out of sight. What father would settle
in such a State? What mother would feel safe
to allow her daughter to reside there?
But lei us not despair. Nevada will arise
and purge hera.-lf of this awful stain. Though
tbis may rest as a shadow upou her for years
yet to come, still with schools, churches, de
vot< d motherhood and a loyal citizenship she
will lift her head among her noble sisters and
take her place in the ranks of those whose voice
is for greater freedom and less slavery to tho
beast that liveth by tho blood ot men.
It is to the credit of America that it has
spoken out so boldly against the thing. The
voice of the Governor, of the nulpit and of
every Christian fireside rings out agaiust the
diabolical action of a desperate State.
God bless tbe Christians and true Americans
of Nevada's plains who lifted their voices in
solemn protest, and wipe the name of the
Governor and every faithless legislator out of
tbe rolls â men who, by voice, pen or vote
helped on tbe iniquitous scheme.
Ido no. speak thus against this abomina
tion, expecting my words of protest to arrest
the downward course of our neighbor State,
but to speak the indignation that fills, I am
sure, every loyal American mar-
The sermon that followed was on "The
Mill of the Philistines." The text was
irom Judges xvi:2l: "And he did grind
in the prison-house." The speaker told
the story oi Sam on and drew some help
ful lessons from his life. He said:
We should understand the enticements of sin.
If we keep company with her she will surely
get our secret and work our ruin. You notice
how every time Samson spoke he neared the
thine that marked him for God. First, at his
word, in the house of Delilah, they bound his
limbs, then his arms, after that fastened the
web to his hair, and then, having wormed
irom him tbe secret, shaved his head and put
out his eyes and made him grind In the prison
house. And so it will bo with every one who
tempts temptation.
He was overconfident ; he went boldly in the
wayot the enemy. He is a brave man who,
when it is necessary, will face the foe,
but he is a fool who, from mere bravado, will
put himself within range of the guns of the
enemy. A wise man sees the danger and
pus-cs on into the safe way.
A violation of a conviction of right brings
sorrow and defeat, That was a sad sight in
the mill of the Philistines to see the once
strong man doing the work of a woman.
Grinding corn, not in a mill th running of
Which required the strength of an ox, but

child could manage, the great Samson, to the
delight and glee of the enemy, grouud corn.
But there is a Â«adder sight than this, to see a
soul shorn ol its strength and grinding in the
prison-bouse of tho devil. A sadder thins is
the suicide of the immortal.

TRIED TO PASS
A FORGED ORDER
Daniel Hogan Surprised by
John B. Davitt, a
Baker.
Pursuit and Flight of Hogaa,
Followed by a Lively
Fight
He and R. J Mullins, a Confederate,
Arrestedâ Both Are Susp.cted of
Committing a Burglary.
Numerous complaints have been re
ceived by the police from storekeepers
about forged orders being presented to
them for goods or money. A few arrests
have been made recently, and two more
were added to the list early yesterday
morning.
Shortly before 1 o'clock a young man
named Daniel Hogan entered the bakery
of Daly & Davitt, 116 Ninth street, and
presented an order apparently signeo by
the iirm to give the bearer $5. The firm
has several bakeries throughout the City,
and Hogan did not expect that either of
the partners would be at the store.
As it happened John 3. Davitt was
there counting the cash, but he was
shielded from Hogan's view. Hogan pre
sented the order to the girl behind the
counter, and she quietly handed it to
Davitt. As soon as Hogan saw Davitt he
ran out of the shop, and Davitt ran after
him. A confederate of Hogan put his foot
in front of Davitt, who fell, spraining his
left wrist. He jumped to his feet and
continued the chase down Ninth street
till he overtook Hogan and grappled with
him.
While they were struggling R. J. Mul
lins, a bard-looking youth, sprang upon
Davitt and it looked bad for the plucky
baker. Fortunately lor him Policemen
Greenan and Allen came to his assistance
and Hogan and Mullins were promptly
arrested and taken to the City Prison,
where they were locked up in the "tauKs."
Davitt accompanied the officers and their
prisoners to the prison and then went to
the Receiving Hospital to have his in
jur d wrist dressed.
W hen searched a lady's gold chain and
a ring were found in Mullins' pockets,
and although he declared that he got
them from his dying mother, the police
believe that ho did not come by them
honestly. "J.JJj-
Saturday afternoon the living rooms in
rear of the stationery and cigar store of
Fred Statler, 167 Ninth street, were en
tered ny burglars and Mrs. Statier's gold
watch and chair., another gold chain, a
pair of valuaole bracelets and other arti
cles of jewelry were stolen.
Btatler had gone down town on business
leaving his wife to look after the store.
He was away about an hour and when he
returned his wife wont into her bedroom.
The bureau drawers were open and there
was other evidence that some one had
been in the room. She asked her husband
what he had been doing in the room and
he at once saw what was the matter.
Mrs. Stutter's jewelry box had bpen
broken open and its contents stolen. The
bureau drawers had been thoroughly ran
sacked for money or jewelry. The total
value of the articles stolen is placed at
$300. Entrance had been effected by pry
in open tbe bedroom window.
The burglars had gone about with their
business very quietly, for although Mrs.
Statler was in the store all the time she
did not hear any unusual noise. . A boy
who lives in the neighborhood saw one of
the burglars, and from the description
given by the boy the police believe that
Mullins is tbe culprit.
Mrs. Staller will be asked to call at the
property clerk's offlce to-day to see if she
can identify the chain and ring found in
Mullins' posesston when arrested.

Body.
Arrangements Will B* M .da for a
Mass-Meeting at an Early
Date.
It is the intention of the Cuban League
of San Francisco, of which John H. Jones
is president and Faust Mascberini secre
tary, to call a mass-meeting of citizens at
an early date.
It was decided at a conference late Satur
day night to have a meeting of the
Mayor's committee of fifty-eight, repre
sentative citizens on Friday night, the
26; at California Hall, Bush and Powell
streets. The following i_ a copy of the
letter of notification which will be mailed
to the committee to-day:
Headquarters Cuban League,)

San Francisco. Feb. 22. J
To Hon. Adolph Sutro, San Francisco Dear
Sir: We take pleasure in notifying you that
Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor of this City, has
now completed the list of tifty-eiebt honorary
members of the committee designated by him
to co-operate with the Cuban League of the
United States, of which our order is a branch.
We especially desire that you, as a member
of that committee, be present at its first meet
ing, for the purpose of perfecting the organiza
tion. This meeting is to be at California Hall,
Bush and Powell streets, at 8 o'clock, on Friday
night, February 20.
The purpose of this meeting is to select a
chairman and secretary, appoint a committee
on arrangements and advertising and take
steps for a mass-meeting, at which speeches
will be made on liberty and questions akin to
the struggles of the Cubans for freedom.
We are particularly anxious that this meet
ing be largely attended, for tne success of the
mass-meeting depends upon the energy and
foresight of the committee. We want to" send
Hon. Lilian Allen and his associates in New
York a report of progress here. Very respect
fully, John H. Jokes, President.
Fa.st Maschebim, Secretary.

from all parts of the coast, and there is
every evidence that the percentage of
the Western population in favor of Cuba's
freedom will compare favorably with that
of any other part of the country. Â»
THE ARBITRATION TREATY.
Evening Sermon Delivered hy the Rev.
William Rader at the Third
Congregational Church.
Key. William Rader, preaching last
night at the Third Congregational Church,
aid, in part:
The arbitration treaty now pending in Con
gress is an advance beyond the old appeal to
iurcelorthe settlement of international diffi
culty. Arbitration is the political realization
ot the Sermon on the Mount between nations,
Force is to surrender io reason. This is Chris
tianity. Ca^ar appealed to arms, Jesus to love.
Alexander and Napoleon appealed to the
court ol physical power, but Jesus sounded the
note of universal peace. A fundamental prin
ciple of Christianity is pence. War may have
been a necessity, but from the highest Chris
tian standpoint is irrational, and tne nation
has been the last to recognize its barbarity.
Two men fi_iit and we arrest them; but na
tions fignt and we tolerate the blooay specta
cle. Wuat is wrong ior individuals is wrong
for nations.
A year ago a war cloud rose over the Vene
zuelan difficulty, but Christian statesmanship
in England and America, backed by powerful
public sentiment, prevailed against the senti
ment of war, and the arbitration treaty now
belore both nations is the direct result of that
war scare. Let us not be anxious about the
attitude of our American Congress. Tne
spirit of the treaty is bound to be ratified by
that body because it reprepsents the ripest
Christian sentiment of the English-speaking
world. It is no longer popular, as in the days
of Edmund Burke, to praise war. We hang a
man for killing another, and we are begin
ning to see the wisdom of suppressing murder
among nations.
The kingdom of God is a kingdom of peace,
and the arbitration treaty, to obtain for the

THE SINGLE TAX
AT SACRAMENTO
Tames S. Reynolds Reports
on the Status of the Con
stitutional Amendment.
Many Legislators Have Been
Converted to the Great
Reform.
If a Constttutunal Convention Be
Called the Single Tex Is
Assured, He Says.
The Single Tax Society held an interest
ing and important meeting at Pythian
Castle last evening. James S. Reynolds,
who has been doing battle at Sacramento
in behalf of the proposed amendment to
the constitution that shall make the single
tax possible in this State, made a report
of the progress of the work. It was very
encouraging to single taxers and a vote of
thanks was tendered him by the society.
Mr. Reynolds was introduced and said:
I wish I bad the ability und the time to
describe to you the progress we have made
during the past three or four years. This is
the .hrJ time I have been to Sacramento in
behalf of the single tax movement. When I
look back t.> my lormsr experience of three
and lour years ago I can hardly tell you of the
difference of tone and feeling that I found
among the men who compose the Legislature.
It is most d.flicult to eel a hearing. But there
are a number of old-iimers and some single
lasers who are working tooth and nail for the
single tax amendment to the constitution.
When I got there the committees were not
only at sea about the proposition, but were op
posed to It, except Bui in the .Senate com
mittee. lam speaking of the Senate commit
tee particularly. Every time I went before It
these members began asking questions about
the single tax. Now, this amendment is not a
single tax measure. It simply provides that
"the Legislature shall provide for the levying
of taxes and the raising of revenue In such
manner as it shall deem just; provided that
for local purposes taxes may be imposed as the
electors of the county and other political sub
divisions may decide."
I answered the questions as they came up,
but always came hack to the statement that
this does mi introduce the single tax but
merely gives the legislature jurisdiction in the
matter. Still the questions came. Finally I
got in and for a straight hour and a half
pumped them full of single tax. At the end
of that time they had to give tip the room we
occupied. The chairman said he was sorry to
interrupt me, but said he was ready to vote on
the subject then. Others said the same. I said
I was ready to submit it. Everyone voted In
favor. The Assembly committee did the same.
There are a number of strong and intelligent
supporters of the single lax, men who know
what they are talking about. Mr. Boone, a
farmer of Tulare, is one of the -olid men of
the Assembly. He says the farmers of Tulare
are ready lor the singpe tux now. Mr. K-egan,
a merchant of Santa Rosa, is a stanch sup
porter. Mr. Dryden, an old lawyer of San
Diego, was opposed to the proposition at first,
but with a little talking to bo came in. There
are (till many others.
There are twenty-two bills introduced
by labor unions. The members of tbosa unions
gave their entire attention to them, and we
can expert no help from that quarter. The
Iroquois Club passed a|resolution that this
amendment be favored and offered as an Iro
quois Club measure. That did much good.
When I went up to Sacramento a year ago It
was with the intention of offering a single-tax
amendment, pure and simple â that all reve
nues be assessed to land values. However, our
trie:. in Jhe Legislature thought that it
would De ill-advised that many members had
been educated up to the amendment pre
viously offered, and we would let it go at tnat.
However, I made good use of the petition that
has been circulated and so numerously signed
during lb. past year.
Mr. Reynolds said he could give no as
surances of the success of the measure,
but tCat there was a good lighting chance.
He said it was possible a constitutional
convention would be called, "and if it is
the day is won. We will write the article
on revenue and taxation just as certainly
as one is written," be declared.

Ignores the Desire of

Opinion.

Mercantile. Bcdies Do Naturally

Oakland Office Sat* Francisco Call,)
908 Bioadway. Feb. 21. '
The action of the City Council last
Wednesday night in refusing to let the
matter of Sunday closing of saloons go be
fore = the people is certainly the most re
markable piece of legislation that ha-*
come from the City Hall. The result of
the question would have been to secure a
definite Idea of the sentiment of the voters.
Tben again, it was not for the guidance
Of the present Council, but of its succes
sor;' again, it was the expressed wish of
certain members of the Council two years
Â°Â»pb that the matter should be submitted
-m the people before the Council took upon
Tj.j.lf the reapon.ioility of closing the sa
loons on Sunday by ordinance.
Yet the Councilmen who are now going
around telling the electorate now anxious
they are to thoroughly represent the people
refused to give that same people an oppor
tunity of expressing their opinion at the
polls. Many people think that If a major
ity of voters voted for Sunday-closing that
the matter would be settled at once, but
this is not so. The proposition was simply
ito allow the question to go before the
people so that the next Council might be
guided by the result.
The question that arises from the action
of last Wednesday does not go to the mer
its or demerits of Sunday closing. Even
this question, important as it is in the
eyes of many people, is of seconaary
weight compared to the significance of de
nying the voters tbe privilege of express
ing their opinion even after tne City At
torney had stated that it could legally be
done. The motive that actuated the ma
jority of the Council need not be discussed,
and the possible result of such a vote is a
matter of indifference when compared to
the injustice of denying a representative
body of citizens the right to record their
preferences for the guidance of those who
profess to rapresent them. The presump
tion that naturally arises is that had the
question been public parks instead of sa
loons the right, of expression would still
have been withheld.
A few months ago a suggestion was
made in this column that if the mer
chants of Oakland ever accomplished any
. thing of merit, it would be by the united
action of all the mercantile bodies. This
suggestion has inadvertently been fol
lowed. There is a Merchants' Exchange
and a Board of Trade, and for a long time
there was a feeling between them that
could scarcely be called harmonious, al
' though it was not exactly jealousy and yet
it was. However, when it became neces-
Vit "--as. some steps be taken to acquire
*ary for some steps to be taken to Acquire
something for this city tbe natural thing
took place and all united.
: This has been apparent on many occa
sions and was first manifested in the ques
tion of public parks. The committee hav
ing this in hand fs composed of members
of both bodies and of the Good R ads As
sociation. Then came the question of the
Valley Railroad, and a similar joint com
mittee was -appointed; then came the
State Fair project, and still another joint
committee; then there was some indorse
ment needed for several bills before the
Legislature, and this was done at joint
meeting. Now the question arises, why
should two sets of headquarters and offi
cials be maintained when the fact is recog
nized that success can only be assured by
all pulling together? Stuart W. Booth.

DR. ALGER WILL PREACH
Berkeley to Have a N- w Pas.or
lor the Unitarian
Church
A Man Well Known as a Forcefu
and F.uent Speaker and a
Profound Thinker.
BERKELEY, Cal., Fen. 21.â The pul
pit of the Berkeley Unitarian Society is
soon to be filled by Dr. William R. Alger,
one of the ablest divines and exponents
of advanced thought in the country. He
has been engaged for a period of several
months, but it is believed he can be in
duced to remain permanently in the State.
Dr. Alger comes from Boston, where he
has lived almost continuously for the last
fifty year?, and where he has gained for
himself almost a National reputation
through his preaching and tbe publica
tion of a number of valuable works.
Chief among his productions is his "His*
tory of the Doctrine of Future Life," of
which fifteen editions of octavo size have
been issued. This work has been trans
lated into all the cultured languages of
the civilized world. Prominent among
his other works are his "Solitude" and
"Consolation."
Graduating with honors from Harvard
in the generation* of men succeeding
Emerson, Dr. Alger belongs to what is
called the "bloom of Unitarianism."
He is In his seventy-sixth year. He has
lived to see Unitarianism change its basis
from broad theism to almost absolute ag
nosticism and has kept pace with the
times.
He is regarded as an "idealist" in phil
osophy, his views being more closely
allied to those of Thomas Aquinas than of
any other philosopher.
At about the age of 50 Dr. Alger suffered
a general collapse from overwork and
went to Europe for his health. Improv
ing much while there he returned and
again took up the work of a pastor, nut
this time in New York. Followine it for
a few years there he returned to Boston,
where he has remained ever since, preach
ing most of the time at Music Hall and at
Metropolitan Temple.
Six years ago he came to California and
was instrumental in building up the Uni
tarian Society at Berkeley, He will be
remembered as a fluent 'and pleasin.
speaker, having a remarkable power of
presentation. President Kellogg of the
State University calls him the modern
Cicero.

He .--peaks on "Spiritual Perspective"
Before Berkeley Unitarians.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 2LâProfessor
Edward H. Griggs of Stanford University
spoke before a large audience at the hall
of the Unitarian Society tbis morning on
"Spiritual Perspective."
His discourse was practically an exposi
tion of ethical doctrines, founded upon
fact and built up by philosophical reason
ing. For the elaboration of his address be
drew largely upon literature and profane
history, alluding directly to the Bible *
only once.
His address was more in the nature of a
popular lecture than a sermon. He dwelt
at ien.th on the idea that truth is a mat
ter of change of standpoint; that there is
no such thing as hara and fixed truth*
that truth depends upon man's horizon'
that as man advances in intelligence so
will his ideas of things spiritual advance
and that everything must De viewed in
the light of the whole before we can say
that there is a reality.
After Diseased Cattle.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 21.â Dr. Her
bert N. Roweli, Berkeley's Health Officer
is determined that the people of the col
lege town shall not suffer from eating dis
eased meat and bacilli-containg milk. To
day be captured another sick bovine! and
he is now carrying on an experiment'with
the viscera to determine how near dead
the animal was while still being used as a
milch cow. When he has concluded his
experiments he will take his results before
the Town Board, in the hope of securing
the passage of a town ordinance making it
a misdemeanor, punishable by a heavy
fine, to sell or offer to sell diseased meat
or milk.
The doctor declares that the prime cause
of the numerous cases of typhoid fever
which have been prevalent ot late has been
unwholesome milk and meat. Much of
the milk has been diluted with impure
water and the meat has come from cattle
afflicted with tuberculosis.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1897.
NEARLY DROWNED
IN THE CANYON
Manuel Pereisa Caught by
; the Flood While in
His Tent.
The Creek Rose Suddenly While
â¢ Hi Was Sleeping Near
Hay wards.
He and His Tent Were Carried Off
by the Force of the
Water.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,)
â¢JOS Broadway, Feb. 21.". \
Manuel Pereisa was nearly drowned and
partly beaten id death by contact with
roots of trees last night in a gully near
Palomares Canyon.
For several weeks the Portuguese his
teen camping in a little tent on the banks
of a mall stream. He lias been working
on neighboring ranches and carried his
Manuel Pereira and His Tent, Washed Away by the Flood in
Palomares Canyon,
tent with him wherever be went. It was
a very light affair, barely sufficient to keep
out tbe hail and not sufficient to keep out
the rain, but it was all that he owned.
During the rains of the past week Man
uel Pereisa has frequently been forced to '
get up at nighttime and make additional !
anchorage for his tent, but this did not I
induce bim to change his quarters, for he |
was in a hole between two mountains and
was well sheltered from the fiercest of the
storms.
During the past four days the heavy
rains swelled the little creek into a stream
of goodly proportions, and the violent
rains of Thursday caused the water to
rise sufficiently to soak the handful of
straw, on which the lone rancher slept.
Manuel, however, retired as usual, but
about 2 o'clock yesterday morning the |
water rose several feet and rushed through
the canyon like a mill stream. Manuel |
was asleep at the time and was not aware
of the flood until bis tent was washed
away and he found himself being whirled ;
along the stream aad occasionally meet- i
ing with a blow from some piece of tree I
or roots as be was carried along the bank.
He nearly lost his life trying to recover |
bis old tent. His efforts were unsuccess-
ful and all his worldly belongings were
washed down the canyon ami have not
yet been discovered and probably never
will be.
A couple of hours later Manuel, half
dead with fright and almost frozen to
death, walked into Haywards and was
glad to sleep in a warm stable with some
horse-blankets to cover him. His face is
badly cut and one of his legs is bruised
severely, and he is surprised that' he
should have succeeded in saving himself
from a most unpleasant death at mid
night in the flood.
LAUNDRY MEN TO COMBINE.
Chinese "May Take One House and I'<>
All Their Business Under One
-License.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 21.â The recent
rumors of the Chinese laundrymen com
bining and erecting a vast establishment
of their own are given little credence by
those who know tbe Mongolian's love of
the American dollar and his reluctance in
parting with tiny more of them than nec
essary. However the scheme 10 combine
is not unlikely to be carried to a comple
tion. The Trustees will probably pass the
ordinance now before them, fixing a
license that would be almost prohibitory
to them individually. In view of this
fact a move is now on foot to unite them
all in one big establishment, where one
license would serve all, and remove to the
opposite side of tbe estuary. The large
building, now occupied, has been talked
of, and would be suitable for such use. It
is located on the streetcar line, and just
outside of the city limit*!. This is what
the Board of Health had in view when it
recommended the license. Railroad ave
nue will then be straightened, and the
ramshackles torn down.
Washington's Birthday.
, ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 21.â The Board
of Trustees will not meet to-night, as it is
a legal holiday. Unless a special meeting
should be called they will not meet until
March 1. All of the offices in the new
City building Kill be closed, as well as the
library. The rostotfice will be open from
Bto 10 a.m. and the carriers will make
one delivery of the mails. Business gen
erally will be suspended, but the stores
will remain open during the forenoon.

stand for quite a time. In the two innings
that he pitched the Violets stacked up
eight runs in this order: VS
! P. Kelly, one of the many Kellvs who
I compose the Violets, came to the bat and
after watching Fleming's windmill style
j of delivery was given his base on balls.
; Kennedy by reaching far out was able to
j make a neat sacrifice hit, advancing
Kelly. O'Day sent a pop fly to Van Nord-
I man, and that gentleman gathered it in
| neatly. Sweigert was given his base on
I balls and filling the base-. Egan was hit
I on the top of the head and smilingly took
his base, allowing F.Kelly to "score. J.
j Kelly a so took a ba-e on balls, forcing
j Sweigert home, and Kronck went to first
!on called bulls, l'i.zpatrick went out on
a lly to Sheehan and ended the inning,
1 be Athletic Club boys came to bat, but
| wen! out in abort order.
The next Inning proved .to be an easy
I thing for, tne. Violets'. Fleming could not
I get the pitching under control and in one,
j two, three order the Violets went to first
ion balls or by being bit by the pitcher.
j When the procession around the bases
I ended the Violets bad six more runs to
their credit, and had not Raymond, their
regular pitcher, gone to the box the Vio
let*- might have Been running yet.
The Athletic Club boys did all they
could to even up the score, but Pitapat
rick pitched a steady game and held them
down to five hits.
The Athletic Club team was able to pile |
up six runs, but strive as they might they
were unable to overcome the tremendous {
' lead given by ticir experiment.
At no stage of the came was there any ]
sensational playing. It was evident that i
both teams suffered from a lack of prac
tice, and this may be attributed to the |
stormy weather of the past week.
The Athletic Club mado a mistake in
putting Fleming in the box. The young
man gave evidence of being an excellent
; pitcher, but seemed to be sadly in n.ed of
j practice.

SCORED FROM
MANY PULPITS
Pastors Open the Campaign
in Favor of Closing
Saloons.
Dr. Coyle Reviews the Action
of the Council in Forcible
Language.
Declares Their Cause Was Betrayed
by Two Members Who
Broke Promises
Oaki.anp Office San Francisco Call,)
0,8 Broadway, Feb. 21. J
The campaign against the saloons was
actively commenced from the pulpits of
this city to-day. Being disappointed at
having the Sunday-closing question elimi
nated from t c ballot to be used next
month the pastors and Christian Endeav
orers have decided to secure as laree a
vote a. possible on the mutter of absolute
prohibition that will be voted upon.
To-day Rev. Robert Whitaker of the
Twenty-third avenue Baptist Church,
Rev. Dr. Kumner of the First Methodist,
Roy. Mr. Sutherland of the Tenth-avenue
Baptistâ all referred to the matter and
urged an active campaign against the sa
loons, so that a vote would show the
Council just how the public feeling
stands.
Rev. Dr. Coyle of the First Presbyterian
Church bad announced that be would
handle the matter at length, and his
church was crowded this morning. He
said:
If my lips could utter all that Is in my soul
this morning, you would not lack for elo
quence. My heart hints. It throbs in wild
rebellion, and no words can express its burn
ing indignation. A similar fire i am sure
flames in many of your breasts. i saw flashes
of it the other night in this room when a mes- j
senger brought us the news from the City
Hall. We had planned for the Sunday closing
ot the silnoiis, prayed for it, spoken for it,
hoped for it. petitioned lor it, and were as
sured 'hat the matter would be at least sub
mitted to the people. When, therefore, after
all the promises that had been made and all
the assurances that had been given, word was
brought to us that our petition was denied
and that we were not to have even the small
privilege of voting upon it, is it any wonder
that wo were hot with indignation?
Two years ago when the fight was on â this
same fight for the Sunday closingâ we were
told by the members of the Council that it was
a question of too much importance to be de
clued by them; that they could not take the
responsibility of passing such a measure, but
if the people wanted it, as good and loyal ser
vants it would give them pleasure to carry
out the people's will. Some of us were slmpie
enough to believe them. We had a petition
circulated and very largely signed asking tne
Council to submit the matter and thus obtain
the popular verdict Willi what result you
know. Then another petition was circulated
asking that the saloons be closed seven days
outofthe week. It was not largely signed.
Many good people who hate the saloon and
would like to see it annihilated, felt that the
second petition called for something too radi
cal, too lar in advance of public sentiment to
' accomplish anything, and so withheld their
; signatures.
But these Councilmenâ the same two that
I disappointed and deceived us beforeâ voted
I the other night to omit the Sunday closing
! question from the ticket aud submit the ques-
I tion of closing the saloons altogether. rim*.
j they played right into the hands of the liquor
: dea.ers. Th knew very well that Sunday
I closing was the thitig the people were demand
i ing, but in the face of it all they voted to submit
; the minority petition, to the great delight of
' every saloon-keeper and liquor dealer in town.
1 ii.vi: no doubt there wus jubilee among the
; members of the California Protective Associa
tion and the iriends of the liquor traffic when
i they heard the news. Once more the church
j people and the K-duavnrers and temperance
; advocates were checkmated, their plans de
| feated, their hopes bellied, their schemes
I turned upside down, and the saloon on top.
Hut while I am disappointed and indignant
lam not by any means cast down. It may be
! that this latest outrage will so arouse the de
, cent people of this city as to crystallize all
I temperance sentiment into solid and uncom
promising opposition to the open saloon. I
hope so, and if my words can do anything to
bring about such a result they will be gladly
spoken. It is relet* of Napoleon that when
in the midst of his wonderful Italian cam
! paign an officer rode up to him with the an
i nouncement that the battle was lost. "Very
well," said Napoleon, "there is yet time before
the sun goes down for another fight." Before
nightfall the great Corsican left the field a
victor. So in this warfare against the saloon
there Is yet time for another battle, and who
will be so faint-hearted as to say that we can
not win? At any rate we propose in God's
name to try, and we shall do it in the con
sciousness that no faithful effort for the right,
though It be apparently futile, can ever be in
vain.
Here in Oakland we have 200 saloons and
the police report shows that in a list of sixty
nine different offenses there were 1210 convic
tions for drunkenness alone during 1800. A
large number of these were women. Thus the
figures show that about half of all the convic
tiors durirg the year came from the too free
use of sin drink.
And this Is the powerâ the plotting, pillag
ing, plundering powerâ that triumphs and
! flaunts defiance in the face of the chinch and
j of decency and holds politicians end people in
j captivity. lam not putting it extravagantly.
1 It iii'S thrown down the gauntlet and forced
| the Issue and said to us: "Sunday closing is
\ km eked out. Now see what you c<in do
j toward closing the saloons altogether. This is
your chance, I defy you."
How that challenge will be met I do not
know and I dare not predict. I only know
tbat the dictatorship of the saloon in mu
nicipal and State affairs is a very real and
shameful thing. Newspapers are afraid of it.
Candidates are afraid of iv Parties are afraid
ot it. Business Is afraid of it. Read the plat
forms of the politicians and the declarations
of aspirants for office. Not a word, not a hint
about the liquor traffic. I understand very
well that in some rare Instances it is the part
of wisdom to say nothing, and nothing is said
because speech would only do harm ; but in the
great majority of cases silence is only another
way of spelling saloon. In the great majority
of cases political papers and p.atiorm-makers
and office-seekers are silent because they are
in bondage to this accursed liquor power.
We want the advantages and attractions of
this city to be made known. For this purpose
we are sending facts and figures out over the
country. Next July tens of thousands of En
deavorers will be here from every section of
the continent, and if they could carry back
the news to the East that Oakland bad so
much regard for dtcency ana good order, so
much regard for its homes and young people,
that it had closed its saloons altogether, it
would do more to advertise this city and fill
up its streets with desirable people than any
thing else. I tell you it is open saloons and
desecrated Sabbaths and low moral sentiment
that are keeping home-seekers away from Cali
fornia.
But, you say, Oakland gets a revenue of
$75,000 a year from its 200 saloons. Close
them up altogether and this will be cut off and
hence taxes will have to be increased to raise
money enough to run tiie city. Weil, that is
practical, and let us think of it a little. A
leading member of the Council told me during
the past week that it is safe to say that each
saloon takes in over its bar an average of
$15 a day. That make- over $1,000,000 a year
diverted from channels of productive industry
and legitimate businessâ over $1,000,000 a
year paid into the saloons of Oakland.
Now do you not see that if the saloons were
closed a very large proportion of that money
would be spent for groceries and dry goods
and clothing and things that would enhance
the business welfare of the City. Some of it
of course would still be spent for drink, for
men who want liquor very badly are bound to
have it. But I contend that the closing of the
.a'oous altogether would leave far more
money. to the City than is now derived from
license.
Another thing which I want you to be clear
about. This is not prohibition. It has noth
ing whatever to no with the family use of
wines and liquors. What you may choose to
do under your own roof and when you sit
down at your own table is not the present
question. No one proposes to interfere witb
you there. The fight is against the open sa
loon. We have suffered its insolence and dic
tation long enough, and now, in God's name,
let us close up in solid line, nil of us who have
too much Kelt-respect, too much- manhood, to
be cowed and defied and trifled with by this
| power, and lien ourselves from it*- domination.

MILITARY MARKSMEN.
A Large Gathering- of Riflemen at
the Shell Mound Shooting*
Range.
The military shots were out in large
numbers at the Shell Mound rifle ranee
yesterday and a number of good scores
were made. The coming match of 100
men to a side between the First and Fifth
regiments is keeping the musket shots
alive to their work. Soon alter the team
of the First- won the victory over the
Hawaiian National Guard the best men
of the Fifth came to the front and chal
lenged the winners for a contest under
similar conditions. The challenge was
taken up upon the condition that the
event should not take place until some
time in the sprint*. The reason for the
delay was that it would be too great a tax
to call upon the men of the First to pre
pare lor a second match so soon after the
first was shot off.
For all the promised delay the men from
both regiments are showing much inter
est in rifle practice and under the surface
there is no doubt some quiet preparations
being made to qualify with the chosen
one hundred. While there was but a
small representation of Company Lof the
First, .still tbe scores were good, as here
seen:
Captain Etrgert 43, Sergeant Goertzhain 43.
E. J. Leary 34, H. O. Leffmann 33. J. Lawlor
38, bergeaut Grundmau 43, J. S. Leffman 32.
Company A of the Fifth of Oakland sent
a good delegation to the range. This com
pany really has two matches on its hands
at the present time, both with Company
G of the Fifth of Alameda. The condi
tions are teen men to the team, ten shots
to each man. Tbe teams are to shoot for
a purse of $60. The first match will lake
place on the first Sunday in March at the
Park-street range, Alameda, and the re
turn match will be shot at Shell Mound
on the third Sunday in March. Company

their usual form because of a lack of

angles at which the birds were thrown,
all seemed to thoroughly enjoy the occa
sion. In addition to those who partici
pated in the matches and their lady friends,
there were present a large number of the
veterans of the trap who no longer take
an active part in the sport, but who are
never missing when anything unusual is
on the tapis. :*'â 'â :â â 
For an opening day the arrangements
were remarkably good, and very few
hitches of any consequence occurred.
There were six events on the card, all
being sweepstakes at inanimate targets,
the entrance fees varying from half a
dollar to three times that amount. The
first two events were nt fifteen singles, the
second two at twenty singles and the fifth
and sixth at ten singles.
Squad-shooting was the rule in all the
matches and the targets were thrown at
known angles. 'Purses were divided on the
percentage plan according to the number
of prizes. Those who participated were:
Messrs. Sands, Mack, Sniell, Fox, Merrill,
Carr, O. Feudner, Fanning, ? ett, Naumann,
Haight, F. Feudner, Durham, Ross, Mattson,
Whitney, Owens, Duke, Justins, Franzen, H.
C. Golcher, W. J. Golcher, Bosqui, Grant, E.
Schultz, Dunsher, Johns, Clabrough, Neu

Lewis, Wilson, Brown Jr., W. Smith, McDon
ald, Maskey, Bruns, Bekeart.
There were no clean scores In the 2o an 1
15 bird matches, and but few in the
10-blid shoots, this circumstance being
due to the fact that only a limited num
ber of the shooters had ever shot over
th"se traps.
Few of the shooters attracted more
notice than Tod Sloan, the diminutive
knight of '.he saddle, who, followed by his
valet, sauntered on to tbe grounds) and
participated in a lew matches with indif
ferent success. .

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
What Brokers Think of the
Tcrrens Land Transfer
Bill.
Shrewd Operators Are TakiDg
Advantage of the Present
Low Prices of Land.
The Outlook From Over the State for
Crops of All Kinds Is Ex
ceptionally Bright.
Most of the lending real estate brokers are
of the opinion that the Torrens land transfer
bill that is before the Assembly should become
8 law. They believe that the system which
has worked without hitch or break in Austra
lia, England, Canada and other countries,
where its use is either compulsory or permis
sive, and which has been adopted in Ohio an
other States, should be successful in Cali
lornia.
They claim that there Is no reason why the
transfer of land should be any more compli
cated or expensive than the transfer of any
other piece of property, yet under the present
system the cost and complications increase
â with every, sale or mortgage, it cos's now,
the agents claim, in some instances of the sale
of a piece of property, as high as $50 and even
$100 to get an abstract of title, and some
times as much more to get a lawyer to investi
gate the abstract and see that it is correct.
In California, where the titles are but a few
years removed from the original Government
ownership, the mortgage or transfer of a piece
of land proves a serious matter.
The agents are inclined to the belief that the
present system governing the transfer of land
should be abolished for such a system that
will prove a* little expense nnd as easy of
transfer as $20,000 worth of bank stock or a
$20,000 ship.
Real estate dealers, as a rule, continue to ex
press great confidence in the market. Some
of them are surprised that all investors do not
take the same hopeful view. They are par
ticularly annoyed at the want of interest dis
played on the part of some large capitalists
who hlegie over trifles, even when the trans
action has every appearance of a bargain.
They claim that just as soon as realty values
show an upward tendency these would-be buy
ers, who are now holding buck, will disp ay
unseemmg haste in getting to the front
Shrewd buyers know that this is harvest
season with them, and they are watching
their chances for go. den opportunities.
That the real-estate market Is likely to ex
perience a revival as the summer approaches
there is every reason to believe.
Those who have b -lieved hitherto that all
they had to do was to name their price and
wait for the seller to come down to it are now
beginning to realize that they have been wait
ing in vain. Prices will not jump up, but, on
the other hand, they will go no lower, and
those who i.i tend to buy cannot do better than
make up their minds that they will have no
better opportunity than the present.
It is a very old saying that to buy when the
market is down and to sell wnen It is up is the
way to get rich. The fact that prices are now
down must be patent to every one who pays
any attention whatever to realty. The infer
ence, therefore, that this is the time to invest
is obvious.
The outlook from all over the State for crops
of all kinds Is exceptionally fine, and should
no late frosts occur the farmers will have a
prosperous year. Already- the cherry and
almond orchards are in full bloom and the
crop will be an early one unless it is blighted.
In Fresno district the vineyardists are busy
pruning. and the vines are In splendid condi
tion. The only serious drawback to the grain
crop of the State, is the overflowing of about
100,000 acres of wheat laud in the Rio Vista
or tale district. Under the most favorable
conditions, it will be at least two weeks be
fore the water is off, and it would then be too
late to sow wheat. Barley or rye, however,
might be planted after that time so as to pro
duce a good crop. The grain crop all over the
country will be very heavy this year as a large
additional acreage has Deen planted and is
looking well.

rain. They will take piace next Wednes

THE SAN -> FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1897.
regulations which are now before General
Miies for review, says a writer for the
Army and Navy Register, are those relat
ing to the schools of the soldier, squad,
company, battalion and regiment; also
parts of the rules for extended order and
military ceremonies. Other regulations
on extended order are still in the hands
of General Ruger, but these will be sent
to the War Department in a few days.
The revised rules contain a number of
important changes in the tactics now fol
loweJ by the army. One modification
fixes the distance between ranks at 36
inches, and between elbows of men in
line and column at 2 inches. These dis
tances are maintained in all close-order
formations. The old double-column
formation is restored as being one of great
convenience in handling troops. The new
regulation^ do away partly with the words
so familiar to military men "this rule is
general."
Explanations of all movements pre
scribed are more elaborate than now, and
the application of a general principle is
noted where necessary, not leaving it to
the memory to recall the rule and apply
it. Movements in single rank are author
ized. Double-rank formations will, how
ever, be the rule. In all drills ana cere
monies the adjutant will, as in Upton's
tactics, proceed to his post first in a direc
tion parallel to the line ot troops and then
to the front, not in an oblique direction as
now prescribed. The new regulations do
away with a number of movements which
Gentral Ruger regards as unnecessary.

MARRIAGES SHOULD LAST
Rev. C. A Splinter Speaks
Against Divorce at St.
Dominic's Church.
He Says the Present System I; as
Bad a Form of Po ygamy as
M rmonism.
Rev. C. A. Splinter, 0.P., lectured at St.
Dominic's Church last night on "Marriage
and Divorce."
The speaker, who is an eloquent priest
from the East, gave an analytical view of
the views of marriage held by the Catholic
church. He said, among other things:
"American legislatures have gone wronj.
on the marriage and divorce question, and
as a result divorces are increasing more
than twice as rapidly as the population.
In 1867 there were 9937 divorces in the
United States, but in 186*3 there were 25.537.
'The proportion or ratio of divorces to
marriages runs as high as one to eight
and ten. I ask you whether Mormonism
is much worse than this reckless system
of divorces. Cardinal Gibbons made the
distinction that in Mormonism polygamy
is simultaneous, but in divorces it is con
tinuous.
"Tne Catholic church regards marriage
as a contract and as a sacrament. It must
also have the elements of unity and indis
solubility. The teaching of holy writ is
plain that what God has joined "tocether
no man should put asunder. It is one of
the contracts that the . parties have no
right to meddle with. Our holy church
puts rare safeguards about it. believine
that good marriages are essential to a land
of pood homes and liberty."
Catholics Win the Election.
WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Feb. 21.â The
bye election for St. Boniface yesterday
hinged entirely upon the Manitoba
school question and created undisputed
interest. The fight was between the
Catholic clergy candidate, Lauon, and
the Liberal candidate Bertrand. As was ex
pected the church candidate was elected,
his majority hem .* 192.
The Liberals or anti-*ectarian school
party put up a strong light, but the in
fluence exerted by the church was too
great to overcome. Arc bishop Langevin
personally taking part in the campaign
and exhorting his flock from the pulpit to
vote for Lauon. Roman Catholics are
greatly elated over the victory, as it in
dorses their stand for separate schools and
prolongs the Manitoba light.

WAS A PIONEER
AND A PATRIOT
Thomas B. Shannon Ex
pires at His Home on
Larkin Street.
Was Speaker of the California
Assembly and in
Congress.
He R presented the State When
Lincoln Was at th; H*ad of
the N ition.
Thomas B. Shannon died at his resi
dence, 2319J_ Larkin street, yesterday aft
ernoon. The fatal affliction was paralysis
of the brain.
Mr. Shannon was singularly identified
with the political history of California.
From his arrival in the Western El Do
rado, when its vestments of statehood were
yet new the name of Thomas B. Shannon
was one of the best known of California's
public men.
He served in one of the first Legislatures
of the Sta!e with dignity and ability. His
evident fitness for a position of trust and
his personal popularity secured for him
his election to the Speakership of the As
sembly, the duties of which he adminis
tered for one term.
When the question of California's loy
alty was raised the Republicans of this
State chose their National representatives
with a special recard to their patriotism
both to their State and to the Union.
Among these Thomas B. Shannon was
elected to represent California in Con
gress, and he served during all the vex
atious period when Abraham Lincoln was
President
During all of hiÂ« political career he had
been a stanch .Republican, and when the
leaders of his party recommended him to
President Grant as a proper recipient of
executive favors, his distinguished ser
vices in the halls of Congress during the
Nation's peril not yet forgotten, the Presi
dent appointed him Collector of the Port i
of this City. This position he held during
Grant's two terms.
That was the last public office which he
has held. During the last lew years he
had devoted himself largely to business
ventures, which proved unfortunate and
wrecked what was once a considerable
fortune.
Mr. Shannon was born in Pennsylvania
and was, at the time of his death, 89 years
and 5 months old. He leaves a widow,
FOR THE SAKE OF ORPHAN CHILDREN.
Charles Dickman is to assume the role of the drunken father in the comedy of
"Caste," to be presented at the California Theater on March 1 for the benefit of
charity. As old man Eccles he will pose as the worthless parent of Miss Leila
Burton and Miss Rose Hooper, two young society belles, who are to play the
romantic parts attributed to Eccles' daughters. s_T7.Â£:
Mr. Dickman, a member of the firm' of Dickman-Jones, lithographers, is an
artist by profession and a typical Bohemian by inclination. He has taken part
in numerous amateur theatrical perlormances here and in Oakland. His specialty
is humor end dial ct. To the Bohemian Club and to the Press Club he has proved
himself r. most agreeable entertainer on dramatic nights. It is said also, by those
who know him intimately, that on certain occasions he has told some rare little
stories in different dialects.
Those who have seen him in the rehersals of "Caste" declare that he does the
inebriate with an abandon charming in one assuming a strange condition.

Arrangements have not yet been made

HOSPITAL CONCERT.
The -Trench Benevolent Society Raise
Minis by Means of Music.
The concert given last night in Native
Sons' Hall, under the management of a
committee ot directors of the French Hos
pital, was quite successful. There were
about 1000 in the audience and fully 1000
tickets were sold to persons who did not
attend. The purpose of the entertainment
was to raise funds to pay the dues of those
members of the Societe Francaisede Bien
faisance Mutuelle who have been unable
to contribute the amounts due by tnem.
The sum netted will be abundant for this
purpose.
The musicians were all local talent
selected from the French colony here.
The committee which arranged the enter
tainment was composed of H. Fahregue,
J. P. L.artigan, L. Borqu.raz, F. Fagot hey
and J. Cottle.
The programme, the rendition of which
was under the direction of Professor Mar
tinez, was greeted with enthusiastic ap
plause, and was as follows:
Selection, "Faust" (Gounod), Miss Amanda
Corcoran and M. S. Martinez; prologue of
"1 l'Ht;liHCCi" (Leoncavallo), M. Benin Weill;

C. K. !**nith of .Portland Loses Money
and Jewelry.
C. E. Smith, a wealthy foundryman of
Portland, Or., and his wile are heavy
losers by the act of a burglar who entered
their rooms at 929 a Sutter street last Sat
urday evening during their absence.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith on returning from
the theater found the contents of two
trunks strewn on the carpet. After exam
ination they reported the loss of $400 in
money with over *FÂ»>0) worth of jewelry,
including gold watches, diamond pins,
rings, lockets and brooches, as well us an
overcoat which hung in a closet.
An examination of the trunks showed
that they had been forced open by a
jimmy, while it was evident that the
burglar bad gained an entrance by open
ing the front door with a key, as none of
the windows had "been tampered with.
The police are working on the case.

RACING TO-DAY
AT INGLESIDE
A Very Attractive Card
for the Opening
Day.
The Royally Bred Rcsormonde
an Announced Starter in
the Stake.
Plunger Grannan turns to Town.
Schiller All Rieht After His
Four-Mile Run
Once more the scene of racing opera
tions shifts to Ingleside track. The card
afforded for this afternoon looks as though
the big holiday throng that will undoubt
edly be present at the lo**al track might
wrest a few dollars from the bookmakers.
There is considerable class to the major
ity of the stables, and these sort of horses
generally run to form.
The feature of the day's sport will be
the Moet & Chandon White *al stake
for two-year-old fillies,woithsl.>UO. Among
the announced starters is the aristocratic
ally bred Kosormonde, daughter of Or
monde and Fairy Rose. Much interest
will attach to her appearance. The young
misses promise to furnish a very pretty
contest.
Starting in the other events are such
well-known performers as Ferrier, game
old Logan, Waivable, Montalvo, the crack
hurdler, David, George Miller and Pres
ton. Altogether the card is quite in keep
ing with the high-class sport furnished
race-goers at the local track.
Schiller came out of his four-mile
journey in the Thornton stake on Satur
day in excellent shape, and is apparently
none the worse for wear and tear.
Riley Grannan, Harry Harris and
Charley Quinn arrived in town from
Coronado Beach yesterday, where they
had been sojourning during the Oakland
meeting. Awaiting Grannan was a tel -
cram announcing the death of his father
at Paris, K.V., the latter part of last week.
Mr. Grannan will not journey home, as he
would be unable to reach there in time to
be present at the funeral. The plunger's
paternal parent has been ailing for some
months and his death was not unexpected.
California climate appears to have ac
complished wonders in the way of improv
ing the saddle work of J. Shields. For a
time the lad seemed unable to get Prank
Jaubert away from the post, but the last
Â«*ouple of times, the right sort of coin
down, the youngster has been a veritable
Lamley at Retting away. It is to be hoped
this good saddle work will continue.
Ana, l>v the way, speaking of the race
won by Jaubert on Saturday at Oakland,
it looked very much like a "shoo." Red
Glenn scratched to get out of the rumpus,
and it looked as though none of the other
starters were very hungry for a purse.
The Call acknowledges with thanks a
handsomely bound catalogue of the trot
ting and running stock owned by Palo
Alto stock farm.

THE JOHN GRACE
CHALLENGE CUP
Spirited Competition at the
Ingleside Coursing
Park.
Successful Opening Day ol
the Great Interstate
Meeting.
The Talent Were Heav/ Losers, but
Expct to Recoup Themselves
at To-Day's Courses.
I
The meeting of the Interstate Coursing
Club at Ingleside opened yesterday and
will be concluded to-day, beginning at 11
o'clock this morning. '
The main event was the all-aged-dog
event, with forty entries, for the John
t Grace challenge cup.
The donor of the prize was himself
officiating as judge and his son, James P.
Grace, was the "slipper." With such men
as these â the recognized leaders in cours
ing circles in this Stateâ it is not astonish
ing that the preliminary work of yester
day moved on so smoothly.
The veterans were assisted by T. J.
McHugh, James Wren, J. 11. Dickson,
0. C. Griswold and H. H. D;*vine as field
stewards, while W. Halpin acted a3 slip
steward and J. Sheehan wielded the flag.
The Ingleside Coursing Park is unques
tionably the ereatest in this country for
this class of sport, and every dog of note
in the State in condition for a run could
be seen in the Kennel.
Their owneis were present, too, as well
as their friends, who crowded the grand
stand and betting ring to the number of
over two thousand.
Less than half tho regular programme,
which includes the all age, 40 dons; Der
by, 14 entries, and the saplings, 14 entries,
was run yesterday when darkness set in.
In coursing, as in horse-racing, the tal
ent is supposed to have a shade the best
of it at the betting-post. Form, built up
on pedigree and past performances con
stitute their divining-rod which points to
the sure winner.
But how often does one hear of the
talent being "dumped." Their judgment
goes for naught as against the mere guess
work of a tyro who picks out a long-shot.
In coursing there is no such thing as
jockeying such as may be indulged in on
the oval track, hence the gambler and
form player in the held feels surer than
the racetrack punter when he has ones
picked out his dog. ..'or instance, yester
day there were a dozen "sure-thing"
courses. They were "dead-sure things."
for that matter, but a few of them, though
"dead," managed to "crawl," and the
most-knowing dogmen lost heavily.
In the case of Lissak against Bed of
Stone it wns 10 to 2on tne former, Royal
Buck sold 50 to 10 against Mohawk, Sky ball
sold _ to 1 against St. Lawrence and Fly
ing Buck brought 4 to 1 against Grace
Darling.
In each of these courses the favorites
fell most ignominiously and the talent
lort heavily.

low?:

AN EVENING OP AET.
The Centnry Club Preparing an Es
thetic Entertainment,
The members of the Century Club are
preparing for an evening of art next
Wednesday which will eclipse anything
of this particular nature which the club
has heretofore undertaken. Tho affair is
to be in no sense public, and is declared
by the president, Mrs. P. B. Cornwall, to
be only one of the monthly sessions of in
tellectual entertainment which the club
has been conducting so successfully.
Nevertheless it is admitted that the art
committee, of which Mrs. Horace Wilson
is chairman, has made extraordinary
efforts to have an art display at the rooms
of the club which will be of unusual merit.
In order to accomplish this end tbe
ladies have made application to many of
the leading artists within a reasonable
tance of dan Francisco for loans, and they
have respondtd Graciously. The limited
facilities for display which the Century
Club's rooms possess will not allow of an
elaborate exhibition in point of numbers,
so only one or two pictures ' nave been
asked from each artist. In all it is
thought about seventy-five artists will
com; with the requests of the ladies.
The "affair Wednesday evening is to be
strictly a club affair, governed by the
same rules which prevail at their ordinary
social meeting. â '^-/... 1 ."
On Friday afternoon a reception will be
tendered the artists and their friends. The
paintings will in the meantime aaorn the
rooms of the club. p.; ,_Â£â¢*

Feast of the Forty Hours* Devotion
Solemnly Celebrated.
The French Catholic Church commenced
yesterday morning the least of the Forty
Hours' Devotion. The church had been
be autilully decorated for the occasion by
a committee of ladies under the direction
of Mrs. Bluxome. c **._'':
Flowers had been banked profusely
about the altar. Over the tabernacle was
a bower of La France roses surmounted by
a cross of the same flowers. The stations
were also elaborately decorated.
Solemn high mass was .celebrated by
Rev. A. Loude: The sermon, the subject
Of which was "The Holy Eucharist," was
preached by Rev. Emile Genie, S. M. He
dwelt at length upon the idea that the
Lord is our friend, our help and our suste
nance. He traced the history of the
eucharist, and explained its significance
from the standpoint of the Catholic
church. â ..--''
This morning there will be a sermon at
7:45. and at 9 .olemn high mass will be
sung. ;- ;^;
