"LITTLE PETE" MURDERED BY HIS ENEMIES
Chinese Highbinders Assassinate the
Most Famous of Local
Mongolians.
THE GREAT JURY-BRIBER SHOT DOWN
BY SEE YUP ASSASSINS.
x 'i\ing Owyang, the Chinese Vice-Consul, Is Said to
Be the Next on the List of the
Doomed Sam Yups.
THE GREAT LEADER KILLED IN A BARBER-SHOP
FOR A PRICE SET ON HIS HEAD.
The Notorious Victim Was Once Millionaire, Race-Jobber, Importer of
Slaves and the Man Who Gave Chris Buckley the
Title of "Blind White Devil."
"Little Pete." long noted as r . the wisest
and meanest of local Chinese, was mur
d.red by rival highbinders last night. He
had ventured to a barber-shop without bis
bodyguard and his vigilant pursuers did
their deadly worK. The police at once
ai rested two suspects.
The famous Mongolian, whose real
name was Fong Ching. had lately made
himself very unpopular with the See Yup
society of highbinders. A price of $3000
was placed on his head and the murderers
catigbt him off his guard at y:10 p. m.
in a br.rb^-sbop at 817 Washington street.

the brainiest of the Sam Yup men had
"saluted his ancestors" in true Chinese
fashion.
"Lit Pete" had two distinct sides to
bis nature, as much bo as Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde. As a Chinese merchant and
millionaire manufacturer he was a power
in commerce.
owed with unusual intellectual
powers, fearless and unscrupulous, he be
came a leader at once respected and
feared. As a shrewd Mongolian, edu
cated in the English language, he entered
the battle for money without any re
straints of conscience, though he bore the
reputation of being steadfast to his
friends. He instigated Chinese murders,
imported women, ran gambling games,
swindled people at the races and bribed
juries in a way that white men would
never undertake.
The murJered man lived over his shoe
factory, in the third story of the building
at 819^ Washington street. About 9
o'clock last ni^ht he sent his Chinese
bodyguard on an erranS, and a little later
dispatched one Murray, a white body
guard, to get him a newspaper.
"I will go downstairs and get shaved
while you are gone," he said.
The guard advised him not to be so rash
as to venture out alone, but "Little Pete"
said, "That's all right, I'll take care of
myself." In less than ten minutes the re
markable man was a corpse.
After he left his home he walked down
tnroagh his shoe factory to tne barber
shop at 817 Washington street, conducted
by Chung Ching, Won;; Chung and Wong
Kuw.
He sat about four feet from the door of

! the barber-shop, facing Ross alley. In
i the shop were two barbers and a man who
! had just been shaved. Suddenly two men
: entered with a rush, waiting rapidly
toward "Little Pete," who was sitting
down in an ordinary chair to be shaved.
Before anybody conld comprehend \\\hat
â  the visitors meant one of them drew a re

eye and one entered the brain just above

One of the men ran rapidly toward
Waverly place. Sergeant Mooney and his
posse were soon on the scene and Officer
, Myler arrested one of the barbers as a
> witness.
In a few minutes Sergeant Wollweber
! and fourteen officers were upon the scene.
j The streets were crowded with excited
! Chinese and ail who came within reach
\ were searched for weapons, but none were
: found.
Little Pete conducted his shoe business
! under the name of F. C. Peters <fc Co., but
! the firm consisted of Little Pete, his uncle,
i Fong Yuen, and bis brother Fong Shun.
They employed about forty men.
The dead man came here in 1878 and
i was 34 years of age. He was born ten
i miles from Canton and arriving here at an
' early age acquired a good English educa
| tioa.
He passed through the Grammar and
High schools of this City, married, and
leaves three boys and a girl. He leaves a
widow also, in China.

his efforts, and was to get $30,000 more on
completion of the work.
THE SUSPECTS' STORIES..
Those Who Took Flight Pretend
Innocenc .
Wong Sing and Chin Poy, the two men
suspected of the murder, were brought
from the California-street station by Po
liceman Murty Cullinan, who arrested
them in tlieir lodging-house on Waverley
place.
They were interrogated by Lieutenant
Birdsall. but they denied an y complicity
in the affair, ?+\d they were in their room
at the time and did not even hear the
shots.
Chin Poy, who is a cook, and came here
about two weeks ago from Portland, did
the talking.
He said he was cook in the service there
j of Herbert Folger, an insurance agent,
| and came here with him and his family.
Mr. Folger was now living in a hotel, but
j as soon as he got a house Poy said he was
going with him again as cook.
The other suspect, Wong Sing, pretended
that he could not understand English.
Poy said he came here about a month ago
from Alaska, where he had been working
in a cannery. He is a well dressed
Chinese and does not have the appearance
of a man who was used to working, in a
cannery.
Wong Lune, a laundryman, who hap
pened to bo in tne barber-shqp when
"Little Pete" was shot, was also brought
to the City Prison by P liceman Callinan,
and is being detained as a witness. He
pretended to be entirely ignorant of who
the men were that did the shooting.
Special Officer George We.cli said he
saw the two men running out of the bar
ber-shop. Ke chased them, and saw orue
of them droD the revolver, which he
picked up. He saw them enter the lodg
inz-houseon \Vaverly place, and notified
Policeman Callinan. He identified :\Vong
Sing and Chin Poy as the two men he saw
running out of the snap and followed.
WHY HE WAS MURDERED.

Men Who Demolished the See
Yup Headquarters.

lowed the footsteps of tbe murdered Chi
nese, the peer among his fellow-country
men. The first cloud of trouble that last
evening culminated in Little Pete's assas
sination obscured the horizon of peace
about two years ago.
At that time the See Yuri and Sam Yup
societies, between which there had always
existed an unfriendly feeling, declared a
mutual boycott. This Jed to no end of
trouble and murder upon murder was the
result.
The-f cud finally .rear, bed tL. -Â»"f the
CliinÂ»Â«j Eaapero?, and an e^tct ssued
by him, threatening vengeance. unless an
amicable settlement was reached.
Up to this time Little Pete's name was
seldom used in connection with the trou
ble. The See Yups appeared to
be the most aggressive in the
controversy and the Sam Yup
Company finally decided to crush thani;
to shatter their society if possible and
scatter them over the face of the globe.
Little Pete being the genius of the Sam
Yup Society was selected to general the
battle against the enemy.
All went quietly for a while, but finally
Chinatown was shocked to the core by the
demolition of ihe Lee Yup headquarters,
corner of Clay street and Waverly place.
Ferdinand Callundan, a private detective,
and his associates entered the headquar
ters, sacred to the See Yups, and with
keen-edged axes smasned, cut and broke
tbe furnishings and paraphernalia into
splinters.
The joss pictures and carvings were
wrenched from their fastenings and added
to the scene of chaos. The detective*
then left, but as a Cninese society's de
cree or an Emperor's edict are not re-
SDected by the courts, Callundan was ar
rested and enjoined from committing
further demolition.
It was reported that Little Pete, co
operating with KinÂ« Owyansr, Vice
Consul, were behind Callundan and that
Little Pete received $10,000 for having the
job committed.
It was also reported that he was to re
ceive $30,000 more, or $40,000 in all, when
the See Yuns were an extinct people.
A reward for Pete's and King Ow
yang's assassination was promptly
offered. First $1000 was offered by un
known Chinese, but as the amount was
too small to benefit the lighting men,
when it came to killing the most influen
tial Chinese in America, the price was
raised to $2000.
Even these did not have the desired ef
fect and Little Pete lived on. Friday
night the reward was raised to $3000 and
the high binders began to stalk the streets,
looking for the man who was doomed
to die.
Last night they found him alune, his
guard was absent, and in an instant two
bullets had pierced his brain and he fell to
the floor dead.
LITTLE PETE'S CAREER.
First a Poor Boy, Then a Manu-
facturer, Next a Capitalist.
Fong Ching, or "Little Pete," as he was
better known, was one of the prominent
business men of San Francisco, though a
Chinaman. He was shrewd, tactful and*
successful, and was probably as noted a
Chinese character as there is in ike United
States.
At the time of his death be was posi
tively known to be worth not less than
$100,000, and the total value of his estate
in San Francisco is estimated by various
white men connected with him in a lepal
and representative character to be any
where from $100,000 to $.500,000.
The fact has always been notic d during
the last fifteen yeara that if Fong Chins
had occasion to use anywhere from $1000
to $25,000 in cash he had itn money ready,
Fonj; Chinp, or "Little Pete," was not
born in San Francisco, as has been com
monly supposed.
He came to this shore when 5 years
old, and was between 32 and 33 years of
age at the time of hisdeath. He was born
in Kow Kong, China. He first started in
to made his fortune in America as an er
rand-boy in a shoe factory on Sacramento
street. Ha was a very quick and apt "Chi
nese kid."
While an errand-boy he ghowed tbe
mettle of ambition by going to an English
school at night. It is a singular fact that
while he spoke his native tougue fluently
he could not read or write a word of
! Chinese except his own name.
His aptitude and affability mode him
j friends. He was probably the best known
J Chinaman in San Francisco. He seemed
j to have a peculiar faculty for making
I friends among while people.
Having graduated from the errand-boy
J stage be next became a broker in the
i customs business. He landed a large
amount of for ihe Chinese raer-
I chants and also accelerated the landing of
| Chinese in Sau Francisco, thereby consid
! erably swelling the population of China
! town. "\Vh !e yet only a boy he was
I looked to for legal and general advice by
j the Chinese.
Later, having made considerable money
i in the brokerage business, he went into
j the business of shoe manufacturing on
I his own account, and at the time of his
j death was one o! the largest shoe manu
-1 facturers in San Francisco. The English
i name of the shoe firm is F. C. Peters &
Co., the Chinese name, Hung, Yuen & Co.
His first escapade which brought him
j prominently to public notice was when he
i was arrested for bribery in connection
\ with the killing of Lee ChurtK, some
years ago, as a result of a feud between the
'. Boe Sin Say and Guy Sin Say (societies,
"Little Pete" being a member of the
latter.
Burr Love and another pfcliceman
claimed that "Little Pee" tried to bribe
them for $400 for testifying to certain
things, while "Little Pete" claimed that
' the policemen had heard that $2000 had
I been raised to acquit Lee Chunk, and that
they wanted $400 of the awag. "Little
Pee" was convicted and served a few days
in prison, but the case was reversed by the
SuDreme Court, and on the second trial he
â  \va;t acquitted.
About this time Little Pete wrote a let
' ter which became public, in which he re
! ferred to Chris Buckley as the "blind
i white devil," a name which has stuck to
him in Chinatown and out ever since.

of Having Murdered Little Pete.
[Sketched from life in the City Prison last night by a "Call" arlitt.\
He was interested in several gambling
houses and other resorts in Chinatown, out
of which he made considerable money.
"Little Pete" had about $100,000 worth
of property in Canton, China. This prop
; erty consists of fish-ponds and silkworm
1 industries, which netted him from 6 to 8
per cent, which is a big interest for the
Celestial kingdom.
Five Months ago there was $23,000 on
I bis shoe factory boats owing him by
â  white shoe firms. Ue had a white travet
' ing salesman on the road and a white
I bookkeeper.
He leaves a widow and three children
and a brother in Chinatown. The grief of
I the widow and children last night was

Midwinter Fair.
Among the property and other posses
sions he is said io have left in this City is
the Jackson-street Theater, three fantan
games, a retail shoestore at 314 Montgom

| pont street.
He made but one visit to China since he
came here.
Captain Lees said last night that Font;
Ching, or "Little Pete," was arrested
about eight years ago for jury-bribing and
| forgery. Stewart Menzies was foreman
| of the Grand Jury at the time, and it was
Mpnzies who secured the warrants from
Judge Coffey ior "Little Pete's" arrest.
The warrants were given to Captain
Lees, and he detailed Detective Hogan to
accompany Menzies and serve the war
rants on "Little Pete." They had search
warrants aiso with them, and they broke

Jiutsell Sncje Say* the Stockholders Will
lie flir Chirf tinff'er'ru.
NEW YORK, X. V.. Jan. '23.- Scarcely
second in ruiblic importance to the fact
that the Government will shortly fore
close on the lien of the Union Pacific
line is the prospect of the reorganization
of the company. In no other company
have so many citizens of the United
States been interested as the bond and
stock holders, and the widest concern is
being shown in the plans of those having
large interests in the company and at
once looked upon as leaders in any move
ment to put the system upon its feet.
There are two views in Wall street as to
the proper course to pursue and the time
which will be required for reorganization.
The leading interests are at odds. One
plan is now before the people which pro
poses a reorganization which shall cut off
many branch lines and junior securities
and assess stockholders $15 per share.
By many holders of securities it is hoped
better plans will be accorded them. The
fi Tit- mortgage and preferred-security
holders aie in accord with the present
plan.
Some of the leading capitalists and in
stitutions are opposed to the present plan
and hope to see a modified plan. It was
suggested to-day that an effort might
possibly be made, perhaps by Congress, to
prevent the foreclosure sale ordered by
the President, but how such objection
could be made is not explained.
It is expected the syndicate will bid not
less than $45,554,000 lor the Government's
lien and montage on the Union Pacific
and Kansas Pacific line and the sinking
fund. It is understood the syndicate will
be forced to pay out the sum mentioned
for the sinking fund, and other credits
secured will reduce the actual ca.<h needed
to about $28,000,000. The sum required
has been secured by the Kuhn, Loeb &
Co. syndicate, which favors the plan of
the Fitzg raid committee.
The views of the older interests in the
Union Pacific system, whicu include
several capitalists and trust companies,
on the present situation were stated to
day by Russell Sage, who has followed
the Union Pacific from its conception:
'Unless the Government is interested
in the Union Pacitic, which it may be, I
predict the road will in the end never pay
any return to those who advance the
money to pay the Government lien. This
Is a decided statement, but, it will be
proven true by time. The competition
will ruin the road unless Congress can
stand by to aid, as for instance in uphold
ing a 10,000-niile law, for the Northwestern
system can tap every station on the nortn
and the Buriineton system every station
on the south side of the Union Pacitic,
leaving it only a narrow strip of poor
country to live upon.
"One fact should not be lost sight of,
and that is tLat thousands upon thousands
of people have invested their savings in
tlie junior securities of the system, in
the $60,000,000 oL stock because the Gov
ernment waa interested witiJ ihem and
would protect the property. They put it
in the comuany as others put money in
the savings bank?. They will lose all
they have and wnatever they might pay
in to save it if the Government is com
pletely disinterested.
"Now this question is not settled and is
going over to the next administration.
We have had assurances from the highest
officials that the Government would con
tinue its protection, and unless it does do
so the company may not be reorganized
for years. With the Government in it an
assessment of $10 per share would be suf
ficient and the savings of tens of thou
sands of people would be protected."
The Government directors of the com
pany met at 1 o'clock this- afiernoon.
E. Ellery Anderson said that the meeting
was hardly more than ' a form. Nothing
stood in the way of foreclosure, he added,
as Congress could not take any action
contrary to the law of 1878.
Jk OW FO It TH t' ( I -V Lit AI. P ACI FI C.
Jirice Says a Syndicate Is Organizing
to Hid /or the Road.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23 â Sena
tor Brice of Ohio, a stockholder of the
Union Pacific Company, said to The Call
correspondent to-night that a syndicate
was now organizing which would make a
bid for the Ct-nual Pacific after fore
closure proceedings.
The Department of Justice is now try
in c to come to a conclusion as to whether
that company is in default. The copapany
claims that it has paid up principal and
interest, and that there can be no default
until January 1, 1898, and may not be
ihen, but in this calculation they include
as an offset $1,800,000, which the com
pany claims the Government owes the
Central Pacific.
Senator Perkins said to-day: "I hope it
is true that a syndicate will offer propor
tionately as much for the Central Pacific
as the reorganization committee has bid
for the Union Pacific â viz.: About 74 per
cent of the amount due the Government.
1 would be in favor of such a settlement."
"Will it be necessary for Congress to
ratify the agreement made by the Depart
ment of Justice with the iJnion Pacific?"
asked a Call correspondent.
"1 do not think so," said Senator Per
kins, ''and this eeems to be the opinion
also of Senator Brice and others with
whom I talked to-day."
Judje Maguire said to-night: "I under
stand that Mr. Huntingdon will urge.the
passage of the Gear-Harrison bill for a
Pacific Railroad commission, notwith
standing the agreement made for the set
tlement of the Union Pacific debt. But
the agreement entered into by the latter
road and Attorney-General Harmon, prac
tiraily settles Pacific roads action by Con
gress. It will be ea-y enough to demon
strate to Congress that no further legisla
tion is necessary to protect the Govern
ment's interests. I am assured that the
Chicago and Northwestern Railroad will
see the bid of the Union Pacific syndicate
and go them $10,000,000 better, as we would
say in the parlance of the gaming-table.
"The Chicago and Northwestern will
offer $50,000,000 for the Union Pacific, and
1 have no doubt that under foreclosure
proceedings the Central Pacific will bring
as much in proportion. Congressmen are
now beginning to realize the truth of
what we have always alleged, viz: That
if the roads were sold under foreclosure
proceedings the Government would realize
almost ti e entire amount of the Pacific
roads' indebtedne-s."
Kunning Short of Silver Certificate*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23.â The
Secretary of the Treasury has informed
the Senate that unless immediate steps
p.re taken to increase the daily delivery of
silver certificates of small denominations
by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
the stock of such certificates in the treas
ury will be so oepleted as to prevent the
redemption of denominations usually
called lor by the banks. He recomineads
an appropriation of $46,000 for increasing
the force to keep up with the demand.

Hurried Ihithtr From Hongkong to Pro-
teet American Interemts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23.â The
gunboat Machias lias arrived at Bangkok
under orders to protect American in
terests, having been hurried there from
Hongkong, 2000 miles away, on receipt of
official news at the State Department last
week of an attack by Siamese soldiers on
United States Deputy Consul-General
Kellet.
An American named Cheek enteted
into partnership with the Siamese Gov
ernment to get out teat wood, the Gov
ernment advancing money. On the pre
tense that he did not meet his obligation
they seized the wood as it came down tne
rivers and sold it. Subsequently, on
Cheek's death, they prevented his execu
tors from selling some of the numerous
elephants he had used in the forests, and
when the State Department took the mat
ter un in 18'J2 Siam resisted the claim of
$1200,000 which was presented. The recent
iroub c, of which tue attack on Consul-
General Kellet was the climax, crew oat
of the claim which Secretary Olney has
now determined to press to a settlement.
Commander MclCenzie will confer with
Minister Barrett and ii the circumstances
warrant a salute to the American flag will
be demanded.
The announcement that the Machias
had been ordered to Bangkok has already
had the effect of materially altering the
attitude ot the Siamese Government to the
United States. She is the first American
war vessel to visit Bangkok lor seven
years and the effect of her mission as soon
as its character became known is reported
to have been exactly as Secretary Oney
ih'-ircd. This information is corroborated
by the immediate effort of Siam to secure
a reference to arbitration of the Cheek
claim, which thai Government has
hitherto resisted all efforts to collect.
Isaac Townsend Smith, the Siamese
Consul-General in this country, is now in
Washington negotiating for arbitration.

Suddenly.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.â After regis
tering under an assumed name Mrs. Julia
F. Jordan, who came here several months
ago from San Francisco, died at the
Palmer House early this morning without
having revealed her identity.

she bad revealed little of her past life. Her
death was accompanied with unusual cir
cumstances, and violent means were .at
fir3t suspected. A po9t-mortem examina

found to be the cause of her death. She
registered at the Palmer House yesterday
morning and was ill when she went to her
room. Her identity was learned through
papers found in her possession.
Her husband was communicated with
and a reply was received this evening re
questing that the remains be buried in
Chicago. She occupied apartments here
on North Paulina street.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 1897.
RIGHT OF WAY
FOR THE ROAD
People of Kern County Alive
to the Importance of the
New Line.
All Clear to Bakersfield With
the Exception ot Two
Small Cairns.
Completion of the Valley Railroad
M ans Salvation to a Most Fertile
Agricultural District.
SACRAMENTO, Cat,., Jan. 23.â 1f the
people of Fresno and Tuiare counties
have been somewhat slow in preparing
the right of way for the Valley road the
residents of Kern County have been lully
alive to the necessities of the situation,
and have their part of the work up in
good shape.
Senator Smith of Kern is an efficient
member of the right-of-way committee
for his county, and in an interview here
to-day on the subject said :
'â¢When I left Bakersfield the right of
way for the Vailey road was clear from
the northern line of the county to ttie
depot site in Bakersfield with the excep
tion of two small claims, and I think that
those have since been adjusted. You may
be sure that we are fully alive to the im
portance and value of ,tbe road to our
county. Our people are naturally very
public spirited, and having, suffered more
than any point in the valley irom unjust
discrimination in freight rates are keenly
alive to the necessity of a competing
road.
"The committee has also had remark
able success in the matter of cash sub
scriptions, the residents of the county in
general, and of Bakerstield in particular,
having come forward with but little
urging. You may say that when the Val
ley road strikes Kern County it will find
clear sailing and a cood breeze."
Senator Smith is the editor of the Kern
County Echo, the leading uaily of the
upper San Joaquin Valiey.
J. M. Hunter of Bakersfield, who is in
terested in the Echo and is also connected
with the farming interests of this county,
accompanied Senator Smith to Sacra
mento. He, 100, is greatly interested in
the competing road.
"The Valley road means the salvation
of the agricultural interests of Kern
County," he said. "Our principal products
ara taose bulky articles which furnish a
largo amount of freight, such as hay,
grain, dried and green fruits, cattle and
hoes. Although we can raise these
articles, especially cattle and hogs,
cheaper than any locality in the State,
we are absolutely prohib ted from enter
ing outside markets by the freight, rates
on tke Southern Pacific. Nor can we
bring in those articles needed to better
develop our farming interests. For an
illustration : l l handle a large amount of
wire fencing manufacture! in Adrian,
Mich.
"A carload from Adrian toMojave, a dis
tance of about 21U0 miles, cost me over
the Santa Fe system $2125. From Mojave
to Bakersfield, a distance of sixty-seven
miiea, the Southern Pacific gets in on it
for $225 more. That's the way the 'short
haul' proposition strikes us.
"We could furnish the desert mines and
ali Arizona and New. Mexico with hay at
profitable figures, but the freight comes
to more than the value of the hay. You
may rest assured that there is not a far
mer in Kern county who will not strain
every point possible to help the Valley
road and who will not give it the prefer
ence for his freight.
"Then in reference to its extension be
yond Bakersfield, if not through the
mountains to connect with the Santa Fe,
at least to the mouth of the Tejon Pass,
at the fofct of the mountains, a distance of
thirty-five miles. Half this distance is
througu perfectly level country, with a
soil that would make a good roadbed, and
through the famous Weed Patch country,
which is already producine immense grain
and hay crop?. The balance of the dis
tance up to Rose station, immediately at
the foot of the mountains, is a perfectly
smooth incline, with a rise of less than
sixty feet to the mile.
"Rose station is on General Beale's
Tejon ranch, and is in the center of a very
large belt of foothill land, which receives
sufficient rainfall to insure large crops of
grain. There are already seeded in this
vicinity 3500 acres of grain, and R. M.
Pogson, superintendent of the Tejon
ranches, recently stated that if assured
that the Valley road would reach them by
next fall they could seed 30,000 acres.
This is also a magnificent citrus belt, and
a few miles on either aide of Rose station
are already started the orange orchards of
San Emigdio and Tejon.
"From the Tejon orchard there have
been hauled by team to Bakersfield this
season several carloads of as fine oranges
as are grown in the State. Under the
great disadvantage of distance from mar
kfts this locality has developed to a re
markable extent in the last few years, and
will soon pay the small cost of an exten
sion of the road.' '

WOLFE'S POLICE
BILL IS FAVORED
Measures to Increase the
Eificiency of This City's
Depariment.
Larger Salaries for Officers and
Creation of Inspectors Prc
vided For.
Merchants Apprcva the P an to Raise
the Standard ot the Saa Fran-
Cisco Force.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 23.â Senator
Wolfe has introduced a measure provid
ing for an increase in the salaries of the
officials of the Police Department of San
Francisco. The proposition has fhe ap
proval of the Police Commissioners and
is said to be generally favored by the busi
ness people of San Francisco. As the bill
now reads it is objected to by Senator
Bulla, for the reason that it may be con
strued to apply to Los Angeles. Aside
from this it has tde approval of the Com
mittee on Corporations, which is expected
to report it favorably on Wednesday, after
an amendment making it applicable to
San Francisco only.
in addition to increasing the salaries of
certain officials it provides fora new grade
of official rank, to be known as inspector
of police, which official is to be second in
authority to the Chief. Two such in
spectors are provided for at a salary of
$3000 each per annum.
At present the salaries proposed to be
changed stands a^ follows: Chief $3000,
captains $1800, clerk "of Chief $1500, prop
erty cierk $1500, detectives $1500. Wolfe's
bill fixes tne respective salaries as follows:
Chief $5000, captains $2500, clerk of Chief
$2500 property clerk $2500, detectives $1800.
Police Commissioner Guust, before ad
vocating this proposition, entered into
correspondence with Theodore Roosevelt,
chairman of the New York Police Depart
ment, and received a communication
from that gentleman in which occurred
the following:
"We pay our men very well here in New
York, giving a patrolman $1000 for the
first year ami gradually raising that to
$1400, while the ii"Xt grade, that of
roundsman, gets $1500, sergeants $2000,
captain* $2700, inspectors $3309 and tnc
chief $6000. I suppose thia would be
higher than you would care to pay, but
they ought to be well paid."
"So far as I have heard,' : said Senator
Wolfe, speakine of the bill to-day, "there
is no opposition to this bill. While there
is some general criticism to measures in
creasing the salaries of officials in San
Francisco, those criticisms do not apply
to the Police Department.
"It i 3 a matter of fact that our police
officials are paid about the same salaries
to-day as they were when the department
was riot a third as large. The captains of
police, such as Wittman, Splllane and
Giilen, have an average of nearly 200 men
under them, wmle in New York City and
otner large Eastern cities captains of
police have only about eighty men under
them and receive a salary of $2700.
''The position of captain ot police is a
very responsible and important one. Fre
quently they are compelled to entertain
visiting police officials from other cities.
As there is no contingent fund for this
purpose the expense has to come out of
their salaries.
"We have an honest and efficient Police
Department at present and we want to
keep it so. I believe in paying men what
their services are worth. To toe proposed
increase of the salary of the Chief of
Police I find no opposition at all. I have
spoken to a number of leading merchants
of San Francisco ana it was generally
favored by them. 1 take it that this was
not the- result of their friendly feeling
for and satisfaction with Chief Crowley,
but because uf the responsibilities of the
work connected with that position. The
same holds good relative to the other
officers."
Senator Wolfe is also the author of a
bill extending the powers of corporations
sole. The only corporation sole now in
the Slate is Archbishop Kiordan of the
Roman Catholic Church. It is a question
with many attorneys whether under the
existing law the Archbishop, in his ca
pacity as a corporation sole, has the legal
right to transfer real estate and perform
other legal duties without first securing
an order of court. In order to make him
free to act without this preliminary step
the act proposed by Senator Wolfe pro
vides as follows:
Every corporation sole shall, however, have
power to contract in the same manner and to
the same extent as a natural person, and may
sue and be sued, and may defend, In all courts
and places, in all matters and proceedings
whatever, and shall have authority to borrow
money, and give promissory notes therefor,
and to secure the payment thereof by mort
gage or other lien upon property, real or per
sonal ; to buy, sell, lease or mortgage, and in
every way deal in real and personal property
to the same extent and in the same manner
that a natural person may, and without the
order of any court; to receive bequests and
devises for its own use or upon trusts to the
same extent as natural persons may; and to
appoint attorneys in fact.

IM MIGRANT TRAFFIC RATES.
Managers Are Trying to Equalize Com-
missionsâ Endeavorers May Not
Come to San Francisco.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.â The advisory
board of the Western Immigrant Clearing
house has decided to submit a resolution
to all the interested roads providing for
the payment by them of commissions,
whicn the trunk line and central passen
ger common lines refuse to pay on immi
grant business via Chicago and St. Louis.
The Joint Traffic Association will not
allow any commissions to be paid, and
plan is adopted as the only way to
equalize commissions, compared with
those paid by the Southern Pac:tic and
other lines, for business via New Orleans.
The arrangements m;de by the trans
continental roads for a division of the
Christian Endeavor business going to the
San Francisco convention id not satisfac
tory to the officials ol the society who
have charge of the convention, because it
spoils their opportunity to get many
special favors and concessions from the
roads tnemselves. In former conventions,
it is said, much of ihe expense of the
society and officers individually has been
borne by the roads being played against
each other. It was reported to-day that
those in charge of the convention arrange
ments had notified the roadu that there
was a strong probability of the gathering
being removed to Philadelphia.
The over and rate made is too low to
allow of former favors beine granted.

Protests Made in Vain
Against the Gag on

fquabb!es Over the Tariff and
Hints as to New Treaties
of Commerc?.
G rman Health Authorities Taks Pre

of the Plague.
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 23.â This
week's proceeding- in the Reichstag were
marked by incidents which provoked spir
ited discussions and saved the sittings of
the cbarube from absolute dul. ness. The
first of these scenes was brought up by
Herr Mantel, Richterite Had cal, who
calied attention to the arrest of the editor
of the Frankfort Gazette for refusing to
reveal the name of the writer of an article
published in his paper.which the authori
se- characterized as an act of le.-e ma
<-te and his subsequent release upon the
ure to extract from him the informa
;.on desired.
Herr Munkel desired that the editors of
new-pa) ers be relieved from any obliga
tion to disclose the identity of the writers
of articles appearing in their Journals,
whereupon Dr. Schoenstedt, Minister of
Justice, suggested that revelations on the
part of the editors of the names of con
tributors upon the demand of proper
authorities was a legal necessity. No one
but Government officers, he contended,
: to be aempt from giving informa
. and only then when ordered by their
superiors in office to observe silence.
A hot debate ensued and the subject was
taken up by the newspapers next day, the
Radical and Socialist journals violently
protesting against the atiitude aVsumed
by lÂ»r. and assailing the
Government authorities and the judges of
the courts for their bad faith.
There was a rather lively debate on the
subject of duties imposed on Quebacho
wood, which elicited the statement made
1 y Count l\)>.iduwski Wehner, tne Minis
ter of the Imperial Treasury. In repard
to the revision oi the German commercial
treaties in 18f3O Count Posadosky said that
the Government was preparing a new cus
toms tariff, destined to reform the tariffs
in the existing commercial treaties which
would terminate ir. 1904, and spoke of an
autonomous customs tarifi as being under
consideration. Althougti the Minister did
not especially refer to America the im
pression produced was that the Govern
it contemplates changes which will
t trade with the United States.
Another incident which enlivened the
proceedings was caused by Dr. yon Boet
ticher, Imperial Secretary of State, who
took the agrarians to task for repeated
declarations that disease among cattle
<was ad in Germany through the
. ;\ of loreign animals. As a
matter of fact, he said, the disease among
cattle in Germany did not result exclu
v from imported animals, but was
very oiten of local origin. German
farmers, be held, should carry out the
tary precautions, which they were
neglecting, and observe a stricter veteri
nary supervision over their own animals
than they were now doing.
Tne conferences which have been
held by the Imperial Board of Health
upon the fatal bubonic plague, now raging
In Bombay, have led to the senaingof Ger
man health officers to Vienna and Rome
to arrange preventive measures.
The Prince of Oldenburg, the head of
the Russian medical institution, has vis
ited O lessa to observe the situation there
in retard to the possibility of the intro
duction of the plague throueh that port,
and is about to visit Berlin and Paris for
the purpose of consulting with medical
ai:d health authorities in tho-e capitals.
The German Imperial Board of Ile.iith
has h;-'4e(.i orders that all persons arriving
from India, Persia and Red Sea ports be
especially watched and quarantined at
Hamburg or Bremen on suspicion of their
infection with the plague.
Professor Drasche, a member of the
Austrian Sanitary Council, states that
there it great danger that the plague will
make its appearance in Europe arid ex
i're--;es the pinion that European trade
with infected Indian ports ought to be
stopped at one? and such ports closed.
Professor Kieffir, son-in-law of Dr.
Koch, the bacteriologist, expressed his
belief that sporadic cases of the piague
â will appear in Europe, but does not be
lieve that the disease will become epi
. demic if energetic measures for its preven
tion are taken.
The Zukunft asserts that Prince Bis
rck is greatly enraged at the indignity
A on his son, Count Herbert, by the
\ eror upon the occasion of the recent
marriage of the daughter of Minister yon
Wedel to Lieutenant Bismarck Buhlen,
which the Ka:-<er would oniy consent to
attend on condition that Count Herbert,
cousin of the bridegroom, would not be
present at thy wed ling, aespite the iact
that b ! had been invited. According to
the Zukunft, the ex-Chancellor regards
incident as an in-uu to himself, for
which hs was u:iable to assign any cause.
United S;ates Embassador Uhi and Mrs.
Uhl attended the annual Embassadors'
dinner at the Royal Schlooa on Thursday.
The suicide ot Fritz Spaber, the Ameri
can violinist, in the Hotel Dentscher in
Berlin on Monday, is attributed by his
friends here to his unhappy marriage.
LADY 6COT 7 'S PRISON LIFE.
Fas/ucnr.b/e Circles Disapprove the Leni
ency Shown the Fair Defamer in
Holioway Jail.
LONDON, Esq.. Jan. 23.â The consider
ation with which Lady Scott, who was re
cently sentenced to eight months' im
prison men t for libeiing her son-in-law,
Earl Russ3ll, is treated in Holioway
I â¢â : â¢;!), Unas adverse criticism even -in
lashionable circles. ThÂ» last titled lady
se::t to Holioway is the Duchessof Suiher
i -and, now Lady Roliit. But. hers was not
1 â¢: criminal ca.-ie, tiie offense being con-
empt of court.
' A strong opinion now prevails in society
that Lady Scott has been too leniently
rlealt with. The ti'ie has turned toward
E^ri Russell. Lady Scott's imprisonment
is attended with amenities, just as were
accorded to the Dcciiess of Southerlanii.
Two rooms have been specially furnished
for her by lier son-in-law, Mr. Dick Rqs
&ell, who paid i he cost of the trial. Her
wine and loud, papers and books are sup
plied from outside. A specially paid
matron warden wans upon her.
She will shortly plead that her health is
breaking down from the confinement, but
i: nublic opinion ia regarded the Home
O trice will require the full term to be
served. The last woman of title convicted
was Rose, Lady Gunning, who admitted a
charge ot lorgery to save her father, a
Church of England clergyman, from giv
ing evidence against her. La.ly Gunnmg
got twelve months and seived them ouu
That no special stigma lias attached to
her offense is shown in the fact that her
name is now associated with the manage

DISCONTENT IN BELGIUM.
Serious Trouble Is Likely to Follow the
Next Drawing of Conscripts
tor the Army.
LONDON, E.ng., Jan. 23.â Advices from
Belgium show a serious state of affairs
there, arising from the conscription law,
which provides that every man who has
completed his nineteenth year is liable to
military service for eight years, ot which,
however, two-thiris are allowed as a rule
on furlough. An important clause of the
law provides tuat a conscript may pur
chase a substitute, and it is this clause
that causes the trouble.
Wealthy youug men are abls to pur
chase exemption, which ihey do in large
numbers, by getting a sub, and thu-. prac
tically speaking, the whole military serv
ice ol the country falls upon those who
aro least qualified by their domestic
duties (o perform it.
Great discontent prevails against the
system which takes young men from their
employment, and it is anticipated th.it
trouble will icllow the drawing of the IS!>7
conscripts in February. The Government
nas received information that an organ
ized resistance is being prepared, in wnich
the socialists, who include a very laree
proportion of the woikingmen of the
country, are taking a most active part.
The young men liable to the conscrip
tion are advised not to serve, and the
labor leaeue has promised to uacn them
up in their resistance to the Government.
Alrnady military positions have been
made to meet the trouble, and the draw
ing of couscripts is looked lorward to with
much anxiety.
TAMAGATa'S MISSION.
Kill Jirpreient the Mikado at the Queen's
Jtibiler.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 23.â Yamagata is>
reported as the appointed representative
of the Mikado to the Queen's juhilee. He
intended visiting England last year, when
he was Japanese envoy to the Moscow
coronation. His object then was to make
a tour of the English dockyards and
ship-building yards. Li Hung Chang was
on a similar visit of inspection at the
time, so Count Yamagata postponed a
mission which he will ihisyear carry out.

easterly gale is prevailing throughont
Great Britain and Northwestern Europe.
Many casualties have occurred |and a

MRS. BRADLEY-MARTIN'S BALL
Rev. Dr. Rainsford Thinks the Proposed
Ostentatious Extravagance a Meek
er/ of the Poor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 23. -The Rev.
3. Rains. ord of St. George's Church se
cured a more complete social recognition
vesterd.iy because of a declaration that he
had warned nis parishioners from attend
ing Mrs. Bradley-Martin's bal masque on
February 10 than nad oome to him since
he took up his residence in New York
City. As to the v. isdom or folly of his
advice, however, there is a marked differ
ence of opinion. The attitude assumed
by frequenters of such social entertain
ments similar to the one which Mrs.
Bradley-Martin contemplates as were
seen yesterday was indicative of com
miseration.
The interest in this forthcoming ball is
based upon the impression wnich prevails
that in point of lavish expense and su
perbnesspf appointments it is likely to
rival the famous ball given in 1883 by Mrs.
\V. K. Vanderbilt, now Mrs. O. H. P. Bei
niont, at the house at Fifty-second street
and Fifth avenue. That ball was the
talk of the country for some time and of
society for even a longer time yet, and it
probably has not been equaled by any
thing of its kind since.
Mrs. Bradley-Martin's ball is to beheld
at the Waldorf. The ball will be in the
large ballroom, while practically all of the
second floor of the hotel will be given over
to the guests of the evening.
Dr. Rainsford does rot denounce the
ball as a form of entertainment, and says
that he does not want anybody to tbmk
there is anythins personal in his protests.
He simply thinks, lie say?, that such
estentatious disniay cf wealth, which can
but seem reckless extravagance to the
great mass of people, is injudicious at a
time when, as he says, the lines between
the rich and poor are so tightly drawn.
He has spoken to members of his congre
gation who arc among the invited gue?to
of the Bradley-Martin's about the matter
and, it is said, has induced a number of
them to remain away.
When the Vanderbilt ball was an
nounced fourteen years ago the minister
condemned the expenditure of a great
sum of money for folly and pleasure.
Then followed a storm of criticism.
Thereupon Mrs. Vanderbilt, who gave
the ball, which was described as the most
brilliant and picturesque affair that had
taken place in New York, prepared a
statement justifying the cost of the ball,
which totaled about $.'50,000, and this was
printed at the time. It was a presenta
tion of fact.-, going into details, showing
fiow the people who work were those who
really profited by the expenditure of a
quarter of a million dollars.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Bradley-Martin re
fused to discuss the criticisms of the rec
tor from StJ George's from any point of
view. In all probability no one who read
Dr. Rainsford's remarks was less dis
turbed than Mrs. P.md ley-Martin herself.
A DEAL IX IJHMIG&A.STB.
Propoted Combination lor a Monopoly
of the Ira flic.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.â A proposed
arrancement between the advisory com
mittee of the Western Immigration Clear
ing-house and the Atlantic steamship
companies providing for a division of
traffic and the payment of commissions,
was considered io-(iay at a meeting of the
advisory committee without any definite
action beinc taken. Mr. Prill, the Euro
pean agent of the western railroads in
mis cla;-9 of business, submitted a report
of his experience and views. The compa
nies are anxious to withdraw their Euro
pean agents for economical reasons. The
prospects are fair for the adoption of the
agreement. Otherwise in the face o! the
Southern Pacific's competition the clear
ing-house may not have t" dUsolve. The
compact proposed is an offensive and de
fensive one, providing that the steamship
companies shall turn over to the clearing
house all the business when it readies t c
seaboard, the Atlantic lines to have sole
control of the immigrant business until
it reaches this side. If the agreement is
adopted the Southern Pacific will have to
join the clearing-house or light for every
passenger.

EXPENSE OF THE
IVORY FIASCO
Twenly Thousand Pounds
Is Squandered by the
Prosecution.
Indignant Ccmments of the Press
May Lead to Parliamentary
Inquiry.
Gladstone and Mo ley Cccfer on Ire
land's Financial Relations With
Great Britain.
LONDON, Enq., Jan. 23. âIt is an
nounced that the attempt by the crown
authorities to convict Edward J. Ivory,
alias Edward Bell, of conspiracy to cause
dynamite explosions, which completely
collapsed on Wednesday, entailed an ex
pense upon the treasury of Â£20,000. Of
this sum Â£5000 was devoted to the ex
penses of the Scotland Yard authorities
in making researches in Holland, Belgium
and France, with a view to obiaining evi
dence against Ivory and hit aleged
co-conspiratorsâ Tynan, Hainesand Kear
ney â and the sum of Â£"2500 was spent in
making a similar investigation in the
United States. The remainder was spent
in the prosecution of the defendant in the
Oid Bailey court and in defraying ex
penses incidental thereto.
In the case of the defense, Ivory says it
cost Â£3000 to carry it to the point where
the Government was compelled, to admit
that t bey had no cause of action against
him.
The cost of the farcical trial having be
come known, the newspapers are indulg
ing in indignant comments, and it is prob
able that there will be a Parliamentary
inquiry into the matter in an endeavor to
learn who is responsible for the prosecu
tion of a case at so much expense, which
he Solicitor-General was finally compelled
to admit should never have been brought
to trial.
Mr. Gladstone, in the course of the con
ference which the ex-Premier recently
held with John Morley, Ljberal member
of Parliament for the Montrose district
and formerly Cbief Secretary for Ireland,
urged the uniting of the Liberal party in
Parliament with the Irish National Par
liamentary party in defense of the latter's
recommendations for the appointment of
a royal commission to consider the finan
cial relation* of Ireland with Great
Britain in respect of the p-roposition of
revenue which Ireland contributes to the
national treasury. It is probable that an
effort will be made to bring about such a
coalition.
It i 3 announced that the Duke of York
will pay a visit to Ireland some time in
May and that Prince Albert of Flanders,
nephew of King Leopold and heir to the
Belgian throne, will make a tour of tue
United States.
Prince and Princess Albert Radziwill of
Russia, the latter of -whom was formerly
Miss Prudencia Milmo of Mexico, sailed
from Southamnton to-day on board tte
American line r.teamer St. Paul.
The announcement is made that Ella
Russell, the American singer, has signed
a contract to appear as Elsa in "Lohen
grin" at the New V rk Metropolitan Opera
house with the Damrosch company before
the present opera season closes. She has
also arranged to sing under the manage
ment of Mr. Wolfsohn with several lead
ing oratorio societies in the United States
in March and April.
A rniicsi nut.s A BISHOP.
Itrfle* the Papal Ablegatt and Demand*
$50,000 Itaniaae* for Sland'r.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Jan. 23.â Father
Haistern, until recently priest in charge
of St. Mary's Cathedral Church at
Barthon, Wis., has liied suit azainst the
Right Rev. Katz, Bishop of the diocese
of Milwaukee.
The proceeding is without precedent
and if a compromise is affected, it mu<t
first be sanctioneo by the Pope. The suit
seeks to recover $50,000 damages for al
leged slander.
Bishop Katz has acquainted Father
Martinelli, the papal delegate at Washing
ton, of the facts in the suit, and Fatly r
Haistern lias been directed by the abie
gate to withdraw the proceedings. Not
withstanding this fact Bishop Katz has
been cited to appear before Court Com
missioner Hugh Ryan and submit to an
examination.
The suit prows out of the troubles in
Barton wuicn occurred soon after Father
Haistern was appointed to tne church
about three years ago.
TItOVBLE 1\ ALASKA.
Abutea by Agrntt of til* Commercial
Company Hcported.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 23 -A Herald
special from Washington says: The re
port of com plaints of members of the Rus
sian Orthodox Church in Alaska on ac
count of alleged outrages by agents of the
commercial company will not likely lead
to nny diplomatic negotiations between
the Uniteil Stales and Russia.
Russian Minister Koetzebue said yestPr
day ihat the persons alleged to have been
maltreated are not Rn*ainn citizens, but
citizens of the United States, thougn
members of the Russian churches, ft aval
officers who returned sevenil months ago
from Alaskan waters, and who are now in
Ibis City, say that it is possible that some
of the squaws in Alaska were responsible
for the disturbances, but they were in
clined to doubt that agents of the com
mercial company had attacked persons of
Russian birth.
CHARGED WITH JFOROBRY.
How the Cashier Jinn the Sioux City
!>arin(jM iiank.
SIOUX CITY. lowa, Jan. 23.â Warrants
for the arrest of Cashier E. P. Stone of the
defunct Sluux City Savings Bank were is- j
sued to-day. The depositors counted on !
$20,000 of cattle paper in the bank vaults
as among the best assets. An investiga
tion failed to discover either the cattle or
the makers of thÂ« notes, and the deposit
ors feared that Stone had forged tnem.
Reports that he had fled increased the ex
citement,. and tc-day his arrest was re
solved upon by the depositors. He is
charged with forgery, making false re
ports to the State Auditor and withdraw
ing the bank's money for his own use and
giving in return worthless securities.

IN A GRIP OF ICE,
SNOW AND WIND
Middle and Western States
in the Thross of a
Blizzard.
Streets of Chicago Filled With
Snow and All Traffic Is
Stopped.
Trains Delayed in All Directions,
and the Prospects Are Gooi for
a Long Blockade.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.â High winds,
a heavy and continuous fall of snow and a
temperature only two decrees above zero
combined to make this the stormiest day
of the winter. The wide area of the storm
gave the officials of Western railways
cause for fear that their lines would be
tied up before morning. The conditions
outside the cay are rapidly petting worse,
and the prospects for a blockade, over
Sunday at least, even with the most vig
orous measures for clearing the tracks.
Mail trains came in late to-nieht from
the West. The city street-cleaning bu
reau and the streetcar companies were
compelled to put hundreds of laborers,
teams and gnowplows to worK, and at a
late hour it looked as if they had an all
night job before them. As it was, the
streetcar trallic was much impeded. The
â whole Northwest is in ttie grip of ice,
snow and zero temperature.
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 23.â 10wa is
in the throes of the worst blizzard of the
year. It began about noon and has been
on ever since, Repoits indicate heavy
Enows all over the State, northern and
northwestern points reporting the mer
cury at 15 to 25 decrees below zero. A
heavy northwest wind is blowing and the
fine sifting snow of a real blizzard is drift
ing everywhere. Kail roads are exrjecting
trouble to-morrow and streetcar service
here and in several other towns has been
almost stopped.
OMAHA,. Nebr., Jan. 23.â Nebraska is
in the track of the blizzard. The wind is
blowing a gaie and intermittent snow
tiurries have been the order of the day.
In Omaha the thermometer registers 1&
degrees below zero to-night and the heavy
blow is increasing in velocity.
Reports from the railroads report that
â what is true of Omaha prevails all over
the State. The counties to the northwest
report the worst snowstorm of the winter
and 15 decrees below zero. Stock will
suffer greatly. Trains on the St. Paul and
Omaha road going north are delayed by
the wind.
Dispatches from point:? in South D:\kota
give details of a severe storm in progress
over the entire central portion of the
Stale. All the trains on the division of
the Northwestern running through Huron
are tied up, ana nothing can be done
toward opening the road till the weather
clears.
The depot at Arlington, S. D., was
blown out of shape and many snow fences
have been blown into cuts wnich are
choked with snow.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 23.â A bliz
lard of unusual severity is raging over
Kansas to-night. ThÂ° snow falling in the j
western section of the State is drifting j
bad'y, caused by the high wind. There is
much suffering among stock. Indications
point to a blockade of the railroads before
morning.
At Â£alma there vra- a fall in the tem
perature of 50 degrees in three hours, and
the mercury was stili failing. The snow,
driven by a strong west wind, is filling up
the railroad cuts badly. It is feared that
intense suffering and death will be the
result among families in the north and
west, where they have poor homes and
little fuel.
Wichita reports a severe blizzard raging
there.
ST. PAUL, Minx., Jan. 23â The weather
is excessively cold throughout Minnesota
and North and South Dakota. The ther
mometer is 12 below zero to-night at St.
Paul, with pro.'pects of a further drop of
10 or 12 degrees before morning. Trains
are moving irreeularly.
Aberdeen, B. D.. reports that the Hast
ings and Dakota division < I the Milwau
kee road and the Great Northern branch
from Breckinridge have been practically
snowbound since January 13.

BF.NTON HARBOR, Mich., Jan. 23.â
There is great anxiety felt for the safety
of the steamer City of Duluth, which is
eight hours over-due, i'lie steamer left
Milwaukee at 1 o'clock this morning with
a large cargo of flour, and should have ar
rived here at 11 o'clock this forenoon. It
is believed s:e is somewhere on the lake,
possibly disabled. A blinking snowstorm
has prevailed nil day, with a heavy sea
running along th;s shore.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan 23 âThe steamer
City ot Duluth, which left Milwaukee at
10:30 this morning, heavily laden with
merchandise for Benton Harbor, came
into the harbor here about 9 o'clock to
night. The boat was sighted shortly be
fore 8 o'clock, when the storm, which has
been racing for twenty- four hours, was at
its height, by the keeper of the four-mile
crib, who t nought he distinguished dis
tress signals from the crew. Tlie city tire
alarm department was notified, and a tug
was sent out to render assistance. The
vessel, however, made its own way in.
Captain McClaln of the Duluth said
that the voyage between Milwaukee and
Chicago had ben extremely sioiniy.
Every effort to reach Benton Harbor with
the cargo was made, but tne storm was
too severe and the boat went before the
wind. Finally they put about toward
Chicago and sighted the city lights about
7:30 o'clock. The boat was uninjured by
its struggle with the waves.
At ihe time the City of Duluth drew
into the harbor a heavy gale was lashing
the lake and the snow was blinding. Less
than an hour before the vessel was sighted
the Goodrich liner lowa, laden with mer
chandise and carrying a number of pas
sengers, left here for Benton Harbor.
Since the arrival here of the Duluth some
anxiety is manifested as to the ability of
the lo.va to master the gale.
Another boat is inside the harbor. She
put in to escape the storm. The crew is
on board, but the name of the vessel is
not known.
Won in thr J'trat Hound.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 23.-Joe
Butler, the heavy- weight of this city, to
night bested rienry Baker of Chicago in the
first round of what was to have been a
six-round contest before the Nonpareil
Athletic Club. The men were evenly
matched in weieht, but Butler had the
advantage in reach.
ROSS E. BROWNE'S LUCK.
Wins a Suit in the Transvaal Involving
Uining Property Valued at
$3,000,000.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. 23. âR. E.
Browne, a noted American mining en
gineer of Pretoria, South Africa, who is
on his way from San Francisco to London,
learned for the first time through a press
dispatch from Pretoria tliatthe high court
had decided in his favor a suit which he
brought against the Government for a
declaration of rights in his favor respect
ine certain ciaims at Witfontain, or in de
fault demanding the payment of Â£1,000,
--000 or over $5,000,000.
Tho dispatch further stated that the
district of Witfontain was to be open for
gold mining on a certain date, wereupon
Mr. Browne staKed out large blocks of
claims, but in the meantime the Govern
ment withdrew the proclamation and aft
erward proclaimed Witfontain closed.
This is the explanation of one of the
most remarkable mining enterprises on a
gigantic scale ever consummated in
modern times, and it even eclipses the
famous operations of the notorious Barney
Barnato in that it has been successfully
carried out under the sanction of the law,
the decision of the highest court in the
Transvaal proclaiming to the world its
legitimacy.
Mr. Brown has been in this country
several weeks, making examination of
properties in California and Colorado, and
has not had an opportunity to communi
cate with his branch offices to confirm the
report. He has been in South Africa four
years and for twelve years was engaged in
(he C<our d'Alene region when the dis
covery of silver and lead was made in the
famous camp. Ha made an examination of
Cripple Creek five months ago and con
siders it a great camp. Mr. Brown firmly
believes that the West is destined to enjoy
a great future in regard to mining.
BANQUET OF FORTY-NINERS.
Story-Telling and Feasting of Pacific Coast
Pioneers at Chicagoâ Last Year's
Officers Re- Elected.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.-Old men
with gray hair, who crossed the plains to
the Pacific â¬oast in the days of the gold
fever in 1849, gathered at the Tremont
House this morning to celebrate with
story-telling and feasting the discovery of
gold in Caliiornia.
The day is known among the Pioneers
as Discovery day. The parlors of the Tre
mont House were utilized as a gathering
piace, and at noon a number of the Pio
neers were in attendance.
As toon as one of the members of tfte
association would come into the parlors
he was met by President Addison Bal
lard, and a large yellow badge with the
California bear and the number "49*
conspicuously displayed thereon was
pinned to his coat.
Many of the members were attended by
their wives, while many younger persons
looked on ar.d heard the talk of hardships
and adventure.
The menu of the dinner Berved was an
I elaborate one, but with no tracs of the
j "grub" which was graphically described
by one of the story-tellers as the fare of
the pioneers in the old days.
Last years' officers were re-elected as
follow s:President, Artdison Ballard; sec
retary, George W. Hotchkiss; vice-presi
dents, Camden Knight and George G.
Custer.

WASHINGTON, D. IX, Jan. 23.â A re
port that, the House Commerce Committee
will report a bill awarding the Hawaiian
cable contract to the lowest bidder was
printed yesterday, but is hardly worth con
sidering for three reasons: First, the
Bennett bill authorizing the New York
company to lay the cable has already been
reported, and is now on the House calen
dar; second, tne Spakiing, or New Jersey
company, claims that Colonel Spalding
has an exclusive concession for the cabl
landine on the Hawaiian Islands; third,
Speaker Reed and other members of the
Rules Committee positively refuse to set a
time for the consideration of any bill
grunting a subsidy for a cable. Their op
position i 3 based uj.on the state of Na
tional linances.
Representative Bennett of New York
sail lo The Call correspondent to-day :
"No further action will be taken by the
Commerce Committee. We have already
reported the r>iew York bill, ami it is now
on* the calendar, but neitl.er ttr.s bill nor
any other cable Dill will be re ognized Dy
the Speaker. As lar as the contention of
Colonel Spalding is concerned, he may
have an exclusive franchise, but it expires
in May next, unless he shall by that time
get a contract and subsidy from the United
States.
"The New York company denies that
Colonel Simlding has an exclusive fran
chise. They claim i at the United S:ates

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23.â There
was a small attendance of Senators when
the proceedings of the day began.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska offered a reso
lution, which was agreed to without ob
jection, calling on the Attorney-General
to inform tlie Senate whether he had
entered into an agreement or stipulation
with the reorganization committee of the
Union Pacific Railroad respecting the
foreclosure of the Government lien thereon
and the amount to be bid in the event of
the foreclosure of the lien ; also to send to
the Senate the full text of the agreement

ment or stipulation.

Increasing the pension of the widow of Gen

[In inveighing against tho difference in
amount of pensions in these two bills,
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska said that there

Dhere that encouraged such invidious dis
tinctions, and that he sometimes thought
that the man in the moon as he crossed

out the stench.]
Granting a pension of #20 a month to the

GAGE WOULD NOT DECLINE.
// the Treasury Portfolio Is Offered Him
by McKiniey He Would Accept
the Honor.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.â 1n view of
Major McKinley's consideration of Lyman
J. Gage for the portfolio of the treasury
and the statements published regarding
the banker in this connection Mr. Gage
Raid to-night to the United Associated
Presses:
"I have not been tendered the appoint
ment to tnat position, but should it be
tendered tome I should not feel at liberty
to decline it If Mr. McKiniey is consid
ering my name in connection with the
treasury portfolio, but shall finally deter
mine upon some other man, I shall feel
no tense of disappointment or chagrin,
but shall congratulate myself that per
sonal sacrifice in many directions is not
required of me.
"1 am a Democrat in the sense that 1
believe in the government by the peoDle
and lor the people. I do not believe in
paternalism in government. As to parties
I have never voted any other than a Re
publican ticket, except once, and that was
in 1884, when I voted for Grover Cleve
land. I voted for Harrison in 1892, and of
course for McKiniey in 189<).
"The platform of the lust Republican
National Convention embodies my poli
tical beliefs as reeards the issues then and
now of the country. As revenue cannot
be raised by direct taxation, we are
obliged, therefore to resort to indirect
taxation, as indirect taxation is lees bur
densome or more v radical than the im
position of duties on foreign imports.
This taxation should be so ordereJ, how
ever, as not to foster monopolies, breed
trusts or favor the few at the expense of
the many. I do not know how I can ex
press my ideas more clearly than by s iy
ing that I believe in the raising of reve
nues by customs dues, so levied as to
promote the general welfare, so equalizing
the difference between American and for
eign labor."
The directors of the First National Bank
at an informal conference decided to leave
President Gage free to decide if he should
be tendered the appointment.

MO3IORH FOH ALTQELD.
.Friend* of the Ex- Governor JPreient
Coitl't Jtttimonial*.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 23.â Twelve hun
dred friends of ex-Governor John P. Alt
geld came through the snowstorm to the
Tremont House to-nicht to show their es
teem. The reception tendered the Demo
cratic State leader took an interesting
form. Altgeld was the recipient of three
costly testimonials during the day and
night. In the afternoon the German soci
eties as a community were represented at
the house of the Governor, where they
presented mm with an address, a mahog
any desk and chair, a silver inkstand and
a gold pen and holder.
Attho evening session Carter H. Harri
son, president of me Bryan League, who
presided in the banquet-hall, presented to
Mr. Altgeld on benalf of his friends an
antique oak chest containing 200 pieces of
table silver. A silver tea and coffee ser
vice of five pieces was also presented, the
tota! value of the eifts being $1500.
The German Democracy of the city at
the same time presented a testimonial in
scribed on parchment and inclosed in a
morocco ca3e. Many Populists were
present, the Silver party and Legislature
also being well represented.
In making his response, Mr. Altgeld
expressed his appreciation of the honor
paid him by the Democratic members of
the General Assembly in voting for him
for Senator when the party owed him
nothing;. He denounced Mark Hanna as
the "debaucher of a continent" in the
last election. He â â aid the election vote
showed "that the plutocratic forces of the
country have demonstrated their ability
to unite with and to control the very ig
norant and the very toor vote of the coun
try, and in that way to override and to
defeat the will of the more intelligent and
patriotic element in American politics."
BANKERS APPROVE OF GAGE.

! had vast exper.ence in monetary affairs;
I he is at all times cool, collected, reticent,
and, witha), courteous."
Thomas L. James, president of the Lin
coln National BanK, said : "The appoint
ment of Lyman J. Gage of Chicago to be
Secretary of the Treasury wouid be an
| ideal one â as good as could be made. It
j would be on a par with the selection of
j such men as Henry W. Cannon or A. B.

Local Cabinet talk yesterday still
mainly concerned General Horace W.
Porter, and there was a revival of taik
about General Tracy for Secretary of the
Navy, with the additional statement that
he is really the man Thomas C. Platt
wants to Vee in the Cabinet.
Cornelius N. bliss has gone SouMi and
it is not known whether he will visit
Presidentelect McKinlev before his re
turn. It was part of ihe go sip about
Cobinet possibilities last ni^h' that if
General Tracy does not l-o into *he Cabi
net be will be the candidate of the major
ity of the Republicans for Mayor of
CireHtf r New York.
Despite the hard work which is being
done for General Porter tnere is a crow
ing impression in some quarters that
General Stewart L. Woodford will repre
sent New York in tne next Cabinet. Ot
the three names presented to Major Mc-
Kinley in Canton by Edward L.iuterbach
he seems to be the most acceptable.
J. Sloai Fassett and Serene- E. Payne
have no expectation of getting the ap
pointment.

CUBANS CAPTURE
ANOTHER GUNBOAT
They Fire Upon the Cometa
and Then Boldly Go
Aboard.
After Capturing the Crew the
Insurgents Destroy the
Vessel.
Some Prisoners Liberated at Havana
B cause It Is Young Alfonso's
Birthday.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 23.â Havana
advices received in Key Weit are to the
effect that the Spanish gunboat Cometa
has been captured and burned by the in
surgents.
The Cometa was one of the most power
ful of the smaller Spanish vessels in
Cuban waters and had been cruisine near
Cardenas to prevent the landing of filibus
tering expeditions. For some time she
had been accustomed to cruise at night off
Sierra Morra, a favorable place for an
attack off shore, and the insurgents de
termined to capture her.
Last Tuesday night they opened fire on
the vessel with a 12-pound Hotchkiss gun.
The vessel was struck several times and
badly damaged. While the crew were in
confusion boats loaded with insurgents
left the shore and the Cometa was
boarded. A desperate hand-to-hand fight
took place on the deck of the gnnboat,
the Cubans using the machete with
deadly effect. Finally after the Spanish
commander ana half his men had been
killed the survivors surrendered. The
vessel was then burned.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 23 âThis being
the name day of King Alfonso, it was cel
ebrated here in the usual manner by ser
vices in the cathedral in honor of the
King's patron saint and by social func
tions. In accordance wth the custom
which obtains on this day, a number of
prisoners were given their liberty. It was
thought that a number of the Americans
now confined in Cuban prisons would oe
released in honor of the day, but this ex
pectation was disappointed. There were
only thirteen men set free in this city,
and they were only given their liberty
provisionally.
Three of them had been confined in the
State Prison, eight in Morro Cast c and two
in the Cabanas Fortress. They were
charged with vaiious offenses and all of
them are comparatively unknown.
Ssveral wounded rebeis belonging to the
band led by Urras, who were hidden in a
hou-e on the outskirts of Havana, were
arrested last night. All of them were
brought here and placed in a military
hospital.

PIRACY OP THE THUBE TRIEXIiS.
Harmon in a Hurry to Oet the Case to
the Supreme Court.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 23.â 1n
the ca?e of the United States versus the
steamer Three Friends, libeled for for
feiture in the December trip, an order was
made by Judge Locke of the United
States Circuit Court this morning, sus
taining the exceptions of the respondents
on the grounds as set forth in the order
on the libel for tlie trip of last May and
the libelant was granted permission to
amend the libel, and if the amendment is
not filed within two days the libel is to
stand dismissed. <Vk
This order of the conrt is considered an
other victory for the owners of the Three
Friends, but it is probable that the Gov
ernment will appeal.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23.â 1f the
published stories regarding the Cuban
ri ibustering tut* Three Friends on her
last voyage of firing at a Spanish vessel
are true, the Attorney-General of the
United States declares tbÃt the vessel is
amenable to the laws of piracy, and her
officers and crew are liable to be punished
as pirates.
Attorney-General Harmon, it is officially
stated, is considering the advisability of
instituting proceedings against the Three
Friends on that charge, and in order to
expedite the case ho has prepared an ap
plication to the Unied States Supreme
Court for a writ of ccrtiorari on the United
States Circuit Court at New Orleans for
the transfer of the ca^e to the Supreme
Court, so that the latter tribunal may
pass on the decision given at Jackson
ville, Fin., by Judge Locke, who held that
the Government in its bill of libel against
the Three Friends did not show that she
had violated any iaw. He gave the
Government ten days to amend its bill,
and declared that unless this were done
he would dismiss the application.
AMERICAN MUNIFICENCE.
Royal Contributions to the Ind an Famine
Fund Eclipsed by Those of Astor
and Morgan & Co.
LONDON. Exg , Jan. 23.â Contributions
to the Indian famine relief fund at the
Mansion Home by Lord Mayor Faudal-
Pbiliips are being steadily received, but
thus far they have not come up to popular
expectations. The subscriptions, of the
Queen, who sent Â£500, and of the Prince
and Princess of Wales, who together con
tributed Â£250, have been overshadowed by
the donatiuns of William Waldorf Astor
and Messrs. Morgan & Co., the former
subscribing iuOOO and the latter Â£1000.
Much comment nas been made because
of the smallness of the subscription of the
Queen, who is Empress of India, but as
her Majesty has never been noted for free
banded generosity her donation of Â£500
should cause no comment, but should be
received in the spirit of small fayors
thankfully received.
The Prince ot Wales, as is well known,
is never burdened witli any great excess
of cash, and bis gift, small as it is, is,
therefore, all the more appreciated. Tlie
fund is now getting on to the Â£100,000
mark, but compared with the last fund
for a similar purpose, which amounted to
abou Â£500,000, it is as yet comparatively
ins^nificant.
'Ih'.s is no doubt due to the stupid ac ion
of the Government, whiot), when the fund
was first proposed, threw cold water upon
it % only to later have to acknowledge that
such a fund would be necessary to keep
thousands of the poverty-stricken natives
of India from starvation.
The optimistic views expressed a short
time ago by the Indian Government, in
tne face of the appalling conditions con
fronting it, are difficult to understand,
but everybody has now awakened to the
extent of the dire calamity that has be
fallen India, and without doubt the
purses of the ricn people of England will
soon be opened to pour a stream of gold
to succor their fellow-subjects who are
now in such terrible distress.

LONDON, Ekg.. Jan. 23 âThe new Chi
nese Minister to Eng.'and. Lo Fong Lo,
is timed to arrive in London early in
June. He brings some magnificent pres
ents to the Queen, nt wUose diamond
jubilee fetes he is to figure. The foreign
office, which has never got on well with
the present Chinese Minister, expects to
find in Lo Fend Lo a better medium of
Communication witn Pekin. Lo Fend Lo
is credited witn a strong preference for
English built warships, and is said to
have almost carte blanche in the disposal
of Chinese money for English building
yards.
Wu, the new Minister to Washington,

London for -one years and was called to
the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1877. Enter

Shocking Discovery Made
by an Aged Couple in
Kansas.
Revelations Made at the Thirty-
Ninth Anniversary of Their
Wedding.
Parted in Youth and Adopted b? Dif
ferent Fimilies They Met Â£S
Stangers and Married.
WICHITA. Kan?., Jan. 23.â Like a clap
of thunder from a clear sky came the
tnowledee to Peter Wilson, an old and
respected citizen of Sumner County, re
centiy that his wife, who na? been a help
meet to him iur nearly forty years and
borne him a family uf nine children, is
his own sister. Both Mr. and Mrs. "Wil
son were in utter ignorance of this aston
ishing fact until their thirty-ninth wed
di:,t anniversary tne other cay, un which
occasion a reunion of all the members of
tne family was held at the old homestead
near the little v:iiage of Mulvane.
It seems that Mr. and Mrs. Wilson were
the orphaned chUdren of Alexander Tay
lor of Richmond, Ind. Their parents died
when they were at a very tender age and
they were adopted into different families,
their names, of course, were cnanged and
:wo sets of foster-parents moved to
different States. The children forgot each
ottier and both imagined that tiaeir foster
parents were their real parents. The boy
took the name of Wilson and the girl was
known a? Rachel Asbton.
At the age of 18 Wilson went to Sioux
City, lowa, and obtained employment a?
a carpenter. The girl was sent to me
same city to be educated. They met, fell
in love and were married there i:.
The fo-ter-parents of both parties to the
nuptial contract did not know that tte
young peoi le were brother and sinter, and
their years of married life the
busts never came to light ant 1 the
v reunion.
Wiison and his wife came to Kansas in
tne early days and became fairly' prosper
ov.-. There was but one drawback to their
happiness and that was that live of the
Iren that resulted from the
union were ctir3ed with sjme physical im
. One had a ciuofoot, one wa
ed and three v ere mii'.es.
ntiui day of the reunion arrived,
the Wilson chiidren, several of whom
married ani Lad families oj their
own. gat: cred from far ana near. Xot
only were ihc children and grandchildren
'c V\ ilsons there, Dut the respected
foster fathers of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson
came â one irom Missouri, the other from
lowa. They had forgotten the fact that
they once were neighbors back in Indiana,
after the iea=t they sat before the
fire smoking their pipes and eicbanging
reminiscences of earJy day*.
li was d >t long an til they iound that
they had once lived near Richmond, Ind.
Tnen for the first time they stumbled
onto the fact that each had adopted one
cf the Taylor orphans. Could it be pos
sible, they asked each other, that these
same chiMren liadme: in a distant State,
unaware of their relationship, and mar
ried? Dates and circumstances known to
Doth were compared, with the result of
establishing beyoad the possibility of a
doubt that susb was the case. The newly
discovered facts were communicate! :o
ihe host ani hostess, who were most un
willingly forced to the conclusion that
they were indeed true.
The Fhock of the unwelcome revelation
quite prostrated Mr. Wilson and his wife
an! medical aid had to be summoned.
The gathering that promised so much
happiness ended in gloom. They are not
legally married and will no longer live to
gether in the relation of man and wife.
They are amenable to the laws, but a< they
have done no intentional wrons it is alto
gether probable that no proceedings will
be brought against them.
SANTA MONICA VETERANS PROTEST
Oppose the Bill Depriving Soldiers' Home
Inmates of Their Votes in a
School District.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Jan. 23. -The ;
bill introduced in the State Legislature by
Assemblyman Cross of Los Angeles by
request, providing tbat '-no territory oc
cupied for ti<e purposes of a soldiers'
home within this State shall hereafter
form part of any school district," has
calied forth vehement protest from the
veterans residing in the National Soldiers'
ih rue adjacent to this place. A majority
of the members of the home are bitterly
opposed to the passage of the bill. They
consider the measure an opening wedge
to deprive them of their right of fran
chise. A meeting was heid at the home
of delegate- to the late Republican County j
Convention. O: twenty-seven delegates
nineteen were present, and all but two
signed a protest to be forwarded to As
semclyma-i Melick, urg;ng him to use all
c effort to defeat the bill.
The oid soldiers c aim that less than 100
of their members here voted at the San:a
Monica school election, and that it is not
f*;r to disfranchise the many for the error
of the few.
Tt.e Soldier-' Home vote exceeds that of
the outside territory by two to one in this

Rumor That a Ityinn Man Confessed to

SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. 23.â A report
was received here this evening in effect
that a dying man in San Francisco bad
confessed to the robbery of George V.
Mulligan, and the Healdsburg treasury in
October, 1893, and asking that the dying
declaration be officially considered. The
report coming just at the close of the
long drawn out suit against the late
testator's bondsmen, created great ex
citement and no end of cojnment in this
city and Healdsburg. It could not be
verified an>i is shrouded in mystery.
The question as to whether Mulligan
was robbed or not has occupied nearly
'.wo weeks of Judge Dougherty's time,
and compelled the attendance of hun
dreds of Healdsbure's citizens. lie tak
ing of testimony was concluded 'to-day,
and the case will be argued by six at

next Tuesday, when a jury will pass upon

PORTLAND JUDGE'S ERROR.
Suicide of en Insane Young Man Who Had
Been G yen His Liberty by the
Court
PORTLAND, Or, Jan. 23.â The Coro
ner's jury in tbe case of A. T. Smith, who
committed suicide yesterday, this morn
ing rendered a ''whi'ewash" verdict,
which is generally condemned. Had the
advice of Chief of Police Robertson, to
scad him to the asylum, been followed
three weeks ago young Smith now would
be alive.
Some time aeo Smith was examined as
to his sanity, and it was recommended by
the actinc; physicians that he be taken
into custody, his mania being not only
suicidal but homicidal. He was madly
jealous of his wiie and had been heard to
threaten her life and a. so thetatingof
bis own. On this recommendation Smith
was arrested and taken before Judge
Northup, the intention being an inquiry
into the man's sanity.
It was plain that Smith was demented,
but on the appeal of his father, Pilot
William H. Smith, and the letter's state
ment that hi-* son's trouble was caused
solely by the excessive smoking of cigar
etteÂ«, tbe your.jj man was released.
About a week ago Smith again mani
fested suicidal and homicidal tendencies,
and he was taken before Drs. Fenton and
Sayior for examination on the reccom
mendation of Chief of Police Robertson,
who did not believe Smith a safe person to
te allowed at large. Tne result of tbi*
examination was the reimpri'-oament of
Smith in the County Jail preparatory to

his removal to the Slate Asylum for the
In-arie at Salem. For a second time,
oowever, Judge Northup listened to the
pleadings of relatives of the unfortunate
man, and Smrh was acain released and
confided to the care of liis friends. Yes

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 23. â The

which had announced a heavy reduction.
But the declaration was not sufficient,
and the war is decidedly "on."
SEBASTOJPOL tfJIF MISUSED.
Little Jennie Tobin tint curd From People
Who Treated Her Cruelty.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. -Little
Jennie Tobin, aged 12, has been living
witt the Lewis laniiiy near the town of
Eebastopol for nearly two years, and dur
ing that time, it is claimed, the little girl
has often b.'en cruelly used. Each time
that the agent of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children visited the
Lewis place, however, the little girl
begged piteously to be allowed to remain
and declared that she was well treated.
The persistent rumor? of cruelty con
tinued to reach the society, and to-day
C. W. Otis, with an order from the child's
mother, visited the Lewis place and took
Jennie away. He says he found her
diessed in a pair of men's overalls, with
matted hair, innocent of comb and brush
for many days, hanging down her Dsck.
The little one was engaged at hard labor
that might tire even a strong man.
Little Jennie now aays that she was
compelled to say that she did not wish to
leave the Lewis family when visited be
:ore, and she seemed to be the happiest
mortal ou the tiain that took her to Oak
land this afternoon.

PORTLAND'S YOUNG WRECKER.
Twelve-Year Old Boy Arrested for Re-
peated Attempts to Cause Street
Railway Disaste/s.
PORTLAND, Ok., Jan. 23.â A 12-year
old boy, giving his name as Carl Ross,
was arraigned in the Police Court this
afternoon. He is seemingly endowed wiih
the vicious instincts of Jesse Pomerov,
his crime being the obstructing of street
car tracks. The youthful offender, who
lives on Twenty-fourth and East Ankeny
streets, was arrested by Officer Molden
haucr while in the act of placing fish
plates and other obstructions on tne track
of the City and Suburban Street Railway
Company, on the Mount Tabor line, at
East Twenty-seventh street.
Young Ross admitted bis guilt to the
court and also confessed that he had been
engaged in the practice for some week*
past. He said he did it for tbe fun of the
thing and did not think there was any
harm in it. Upon several occasions these
obstructions nearly led to serious acci
dents. Only the timely action of the
motorrnen averted them, and had the cars
run upon the obstructions several lives
might have been lost. At one time
young Ross even went to the trouble of
tying a wooden obstruction down with
wires.
The court gave the boy a severe lecture,
explaining tbe dangerous nature of bis
pranks, and told him if he persisted in
his wanton mischievousness in the future
he would in all propability land jen the
penitentiary. Owing to his youth, how
ever, he was turned over to the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society.

Quarrel Betw en the Sse Yup and

Out Anew
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 23.â A war
of extermination among the almond-eyed
residents of Chinatown seems imminent.
The disturbing and often disastrous boy
cott has been declared and trouble is liable
to occur at almost any moment. As
usual, the Bing Kung Tong and the Hop
Sing Tong, the highbinder societies, are
at the bottom of the trouble and are eager
to kill.
The old-time dispute between the See
Yup and the Sam Yup companies is ex
pected to break out again. The former
company is the stronger in Los Angeles
and has the greater number of stores,
while the Sam Yups have larger stores
than the rival institution, and in conse
quence make a bid for trade by cutting
prices. The See Yups have declared a
boycott on the Sam Yup stores and placed
spotters at the entrances to learn which of
the See Yup members patronize the for
bidden places. Whenever an offender is
discovered he is taken to a room in some
sequestered house and there tried, fined
and his property confiscated. In many
instances the purchases have been
snatched from the See Yup members on
leaping the boycotted stores. About
every six months this trouble begins
afre3h. During the last row Wong Chee
was killed.
But the highbinders do not like this.
They have steadily been working to arouse
the old-time jealousy between the two
companies, for killing Chinamen is their
profession, but their efforts would not
have been accompanied by success had it
not been for outside influences. The same
conditions exist ail over the coast. The
See Yup faction in San Francisco enliv
ened things by murdering one of the
principals recently.
Suong Sam and Ah Huey, two of the
notorious highbinders of San Francisco,
arrived in Los Angeles yesterday. Fully
a dozen more desperadoes are expected
soon to assist them in conducting their
system of spotting, despoiling ana mur
dering. The Sam Yups have not been en
tirely idle. In addition to arming them
selves they have asked that some of the
northern highbinders from their own fac
tion be sent here to help cope with their
unscrupulous opponents. An attempt
was made recently by Ah Len, a high
hinder of the Hop Singtong, to blackmail
Wong Chung, a lottery dealer, out of a
large sum of money, but it failed.
CHILDREN AT THE EXPOSITION.
Gates of the Horns Products Fair
Opened to Pupils of the Public
Schools.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 23.â The
children of this city have had a glorious
lime at Hazard's Pavilion here to-day.
The time at the Home Products Exhibi
tion was given up to the public schools.
During the morning sixteen pupils
from the commercial department ot the
High School ranged themselves at their
desks on the staee and went through
some rapid calculations and business
arithmetic, under the supervision of John
H. Francis. Then followed bookkeeping,
under Milton Carlson. One thousand
figures were written in five minutes and
forty seconds. The work was all very
legible and accurate, and the penman
ship of the students was almost perfect.
The shorthand and typewriting exhibi
tions followed and were highly creditable
to the tutors and pupils. Music was sup
plied by the High School orchestra.
The drawing dispiay, under C. M.
Bradfield, was a noteworthy feature. The
walls of one entire room are covered with
drawings by pup:ls from the first to the
ninth grades. The booth is devoted to
Hign School work. The High .School
drawings are spiendid and of a more ad
vanced character, but along different
lines. Here perspective drawing is given
attention.
. There is exhibited a collection of illus
trated essKva on the "Alhamb'ra" and on
phrases of English history.

great Simpson Tabernacle (Methodist
Episcopal), one of the finest church
edifices on the Pacific Coast, with Rev. C.
<J. McLean, "the Los Angeles Parkhurst,"
as pastor, is about to pass under the
hammer and be sold to satisfy a mortgage
of $26,000 beld in Philadelphia. This
splendid building is a product of thejjoom
days in this city. It has been more or
less embarrassed since the collapse of the
boom. It was built at a cost of $90,000,
obiained largely through subscriptions by
local gentlemen who were supposed to be
making fortunes ten years ago. When
the slump came many found themselves
unable to meet their subscriptions, and
then arose the necessity of borrowing
$26,000.
Simpson Tabernacle is said to be the
largest Methodist auditorium in the world
and the largest churcu edifice of any de
nomination on the Pacific Coa*t.
The amount ti-at must bo raised is JGOOG"
with which to pay interest and a small
linatins indebtedness. The trustees pro
pose to raise this sum' at once, if possible,
by p pular subscription.

PLAINT OF A SAN JOSE WIFE.
Mrs. Leroy D. Lacey Sues to Recover
Property She Had Deeded to
Her Husband.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 23.â Flora A.
Lacey to-day began suit against Leroy D.
Lacey, her husband, to compel him to
deed to her the family home on South
Second street, which she al'.eges is simply
being held in trust for her by Lacey. The
property is valued at nbout $3000.
About a week ago Mrs. Lacey sued her
husband for divorce on the ground of de
sertion. This morning the divorce suit
was dismissed at the request of plaintiff,
who at once hied the suit to obtain pos
session of the property. In the complaint
Mrs. Lacey alleges that at the time of
their marriage Lacey possessed nothing,
I while she was the owner of a ranch in
I Monterey County.
She desired to have a home in this
city, and mortgaged the Monterey prop
erty for $1500. With this she purchased a
lot in the Leddy Tract, and built a bouse,
expending $2285 in making a home. Lacey
was very proud, and asked his wile to
place the property in hi si name, so tie
would not be humiliated, and his friends
I would not make unpleasant comments on
his family affairs and relations, as would
i be the case if the property was in her
i name. Mrs. Lacey consented to this, and
| deeded the proprty to her husband, with
i the understanding that he was to hold it
! in trust, and deed it back to her any time
I she desired.
On January 14, 1897. Mrs. Lacey says,
i her husband deserted her, and since then
I he has threatened to dispose of the prop
erty. The court is asked to prevent Lacey
; from selling or mortgaging the property,
! and to declare it held in trust and compel
j a reconveyance of it to her.

misdemeanor in refusing to pay license

and traders. By an agreement with the
Merchants' Association Hinkle refused to
pay the tax a;ul legal proceedings against
him were begun. The city could bring no

Clagett had ;a majority, however, in the

that he cannot hold these much longer,

Thatcher 23, Henderson 19, Rawlins 14, all

ballots were repetitions of the first, except
that Kawlins gained one of the scattering
votes, making his total 15.
The Rawlins men wanted to go on bal
loting, but the Thatcher and Henderson
supporters were afraid, and a motion to
adjourn until Monday was carried by
their votes. It seems as though Thatcher
and Henderson had polled their full
strength, and it is expected by some that
on Monday Rawlins will draw largely

CAREFUL CABINET MAKING.
Many Prominent Gentlemen Under Con-
sideration, but No Further Selec
tions Are Made.
CANTON, Ohio, May 23.â J. H. Brig
ham of Ohio, who has frequently been
mentioned in connection with the position
of Secretary of Agriculture, called on the
President-elect to-day and discussed the
situation with aim. To the correspond
ent of the United Associated Presses Mr.
Brigham said:
"I have not bpen tendered a Cabinet
portfolio, but Major McKinley assures me
my name is under consideration, and, I
trust, favorably."
"Will not the fact that Ohio has one
representative in the Cabinet filling the
most important place in mat body, pre
vent your appointment?" was afked.
"Not necessarily," answered Mr. Brig
ham, '-lam supported by tne strong in
dorsements of the State and National
granges. My appointment to the Cabinet
would not be a State matter. It would be
made on National lines."
The chances are, however, that Ohio
will not have more than one place in the
Cabinet, though it Is possible Colonel
Brigbam may bo offered the post of As
sistant Secretary of Agriculture.
Notwithstanding all that has been said
about tne reported tender of a Oabinet
portfolio to Lyman J. Gage ol Chicago, it
Â«an be positively announced that nobody
has been rsked to accept the Treasury
portfolio. The President-elect holds Mr.
Gage in high esteem, and hfÂ»s, doubtless,
asked some of his friends to quietly ascer
tain whether Mr. Gage would be In a
position to go into the Cabinet if invited.
This does not mean that he has been or
will be tendered a Cabinet position, but
that he is under favorable consideration.
Ex-Secretary Fairbanks, the commis
sion man W. T. Durban and Judse Mont
of Indiana paid their respects to Major

tion for appointment as T/onsul-General
to Paris and will have the indorsement of
Senator Fairbanks.
Senator Carter of Montana and Senator
Wilson of Washington called on Major
McKinley to-day to talk about some ap
pointments in the far West.
The report which reached here from the
East to-day to the effect that Robert P.

secure his retention, but it will doubtless
be unsuccessful.

Causes Factional Strife in
the First Baptist
Church.
Pastor Harriman Resigns and
Many of the '"Come-Outers"
Withdraw.
Doctrines cf the Visiting Ev ngelist
Not in Favor With the
Majority.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 23.â The trouble
which has been brewiog among the mem
bers of the First Baptist Church since the
arrival of Hew Peter Robinson from Cal
ifornia a week ago and tLe introduction of
hid doctrine of sanctification culminated
Jast evening in the announcement by the
pastor, Mr. Harriman, that he would not
preach iv the church until the "demons
have been removed from the members of
his congregation." A meeting of the
pulpit committee of tne church was held
this morning in the office of Deacon
Cavender for the purpose of filling the
vacant pulpit of the churcn, and an in
vitation was extended to Rey. C. Spurgeon
Med burst, who will occupy the pulpit to
morrow.
The troubie which has now reached such
an acute stage was caused, it is said by
the most prominent members of the con
gregation, by the doctrines which have
been advocated by the Rev. Mr. Robin
son. About a score of members have
taken kindly to the new ideas, and among
them is the pastor. Mr. Harriman, and
ihese have been holding nightly meetings
In the church.
At the conclusion of the regular services
last evening the pastor requested those
who did not concur in the new doctrines
to leave the church and allow the follow
ers of the Rev. Mr. Robinson to hold their
regular after- meeting undisturbed by the
presence of the unbelievers. As the ma
jority of the members did not seem to
take kindly to the idea of being ordered
from their own church, the pastor made
the declaration that the meeting* would
be continued in a different place.
It is thought by many that the pro
longed strain of the recent meetings has
been too great for the pastor and that
mental trouble will ensue unless he takes
a rest. However, his determination to
follow the teacliines of the Rev. Mr. Rob
inson cannot be shaken, and if a new
cuurch is organized by the "come-outers"
it is expected he will minister to its spirit
ual wants.
A number of prominent members ac
cepted Rev. Mr. Harriman's invitation
last nis<ut and left the church. After
this Mr. Harriman turned his back to the
audience and kneeled at the pulpit. In
this position he remained the entire
evening. When reporters entered church
long after midnight he was still in the
same position, his head bowed in silent
prayer, while down in the auditorium
were about twenty of the followers of Rev.
Mr. Robinson's creed laughing, crying
arfd praying at the Â»ame time.
The latter base their sanctification doc
trine upon two passages of scripture.
One of these, from Paul's letter to the
Kphesians, is:
Be ye filled with the spirit. â¢
The other, from Paul's Ei>i9tle to the
Thessalor.ians, is:
For this is the will of God. ever your
fluntion, that ye should abstain from fornica
tion.
It seems that Mr. Harriman has been
somewhat in doubt what course he ahould
pursue, and for nearly two weeks he has
been fasting and prayine. One week of
this time he spent at his home, denying
himself to friends and to members of his
congregation until he should again re
ceive the holy spirit. Several nights ago
he again appeared nt evening meetings
and assisted the "come-outers."
Rev. M*. Robinson is here on his way to
the Chinfse mission fieid, where he will

WILL STOCK AN
OSTRICH RANCH
Baron yon Schroeder to
Embark in a New
Venture.
Crops of Plumage Added to the
Harvest of His Eagle
Ranch.
Preparing a Tract of Land for the
Reception of the African
Birds.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Jan. 23.â J.
H. yon Schroeder is about to embark in a
new venture. A tract recently added to
his famous Eagle ranch, twenty miles
from this city, is to be stocked with os
triches. The Baron is going into the os
trich-raising industry on an extensive
scale, and the enterprise will be watered
with interest by ranchers uereabouts.
Baron yon Schroeder has taken out a
patent on lots 5 to 8, in Township 29, and
thi!; land will be used for the farm. It is
admirably located in the foothills of the
Santa Lucia Mountains, and there is suffi
cient level and rolling land to make a
grand home from the African bird. Large
pens and sheds are to be built. The pens
will be fenced with a strong wire netting
about seven feet high. In that section
there is an abundance of grass, leaves and
acorns, which constitute the principal
food of the large bipeds.
Baron yon Schroeder has a beautiful
estate and is the owner of the largest
prune orchard in the world. He is the
right kind of a man to commence the new
industry, as he has mads a success of
every experiment he tried on the Eagle
ranch and the people hope his new ven
ture will turn out as weJJ. The new farm
is located at the west end of the ranch and
is about five miles from Santa Margarita.
People who are in this city from Los
Angeles say there is no reason why the
ostrich-raising industry should not pay as
well as it does at Anaheim and Lob
Ang.-les, for the conditions here are
greatly in its favor. The work of preparing
the land for the reception of the bird will
soon be commenced, and no doubt many
tourists who visit this part of the State
will make a trip to the new farm to see the
ostrich herds. The bipeds will be shipped
to the place when it is in condition to
receive them. The people here are well
pleased to hear of the Baron's enterprise,
as it will be a standing advertisement of
the congenial climate and resources of this
couniy. ___^______

clever Chicagoan, and White kept poking
rights in at will. Skelly became very
grogsy and began clinching to avpid
punishment, while Whito kept pounding
him with both bund-. Skelly's eye was
nearly closed when the bell rang. Skelly
rallied in the fourth and sent a right and
left swing for the neck, but White punched
him badly toward the close. In the fifth
round, White floored his man with a right
swing, and Skeliy was counted out. The
round lasted one minute and six seconds.

The veteran Jem Mace looked after MabÂ»r

In the first three rounds honors were
about even, but after that Maber's agility
and cleverness kept the pro:essor guessing
all the time. In the fifteenth round Ma

unable to continue and Maber got the de

The Forfarshire left Pacific-street wharf
yesterday for good. For some time to
come her home will be in Richardsons
Bay, and when she sails again the chances
are that her cargo will be put aboard at
Port Costa. The narrow escape that the
vessel had last Thursday is still the topic
of conversation along the front. After the
I ballast was put in the remainder of the
' coa! ffa? taken out, and yesterday when
| the tup Sea Queen moved the vessel from
I alongside the Monowai "she stood up as
I stiff as a church."
When the hawsers began to snap it was
a question as to which of the men in the
hoid could get on deck quickest. Weigher
Moran, who was there representing the
Custom-house, and Second Officer Fraser
of the Monowai were nearest the iadder
when the vessel be^an to careen. '"It was
a case of every man for himself and devil
take the hindmost," said Fraser, "but I
tell you that Moran beat me ten ieet in a
hundred and was on beard the Monowai
before I got my head through the hatch
way. In the first ph.ee sue roiled over
toward the steamer and that gave us a
pretty good scare. Then she went over to
starboard and kept on j:oing until we
thought it was time to get a move on.
The hawsers held, however, and when the
ballast was put in she righted Herself
without any aid."
The Forfarshire s:i!l has her crew
aboard, and the men will remain by the
ship un.il she is ready to sail for a foreign
port with a cargo of wheat or general
merchandise.
John Stauge, late ship's carpenter on
the barkentine S. N. Castle, has gone into

food, and now has gone into business on
East street. No one connected with the
water front is better known or better liked

The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Gaelic arrived from Hongk mar
via Yokohama yesterday. This is the
first trip she lias mad" to this port since
she '.vent ashore at Shimonoseki, Japan,
List October. Captain P<?arne died in
Yokohama, and his death is said to have
been .iccelerated by worry over the strand
ing of the ship. Captain William Finch,
who is now in command of the Gaelic,
was formerly master of the Arabic and
was sent from England by the White Star
line to take charge of the renovated
bteamer.
The following-named passengers arrived
on t: c Gaelic: M. A. Winning, Miss L.
Averi'J, Mr. and Mrs. b\ H. Lorintr, Miss
E. Gardner, W. S. Gage, W, G. Hockriclge,
\V. H. Wiley, Joseph Theland, Charles
Pernet, W. C. Cllft, M. I. Hart, F. H.
Heidel-chim. M. 0. Theis, Captain Hasn
eriminoff, M. Schegoleff, Simla Shadrin,
Theodore Shadrin, M. A. Martzin.
A series of jrales were run into during
the voyage, and il was only when the Pa
cific Coast was reached that anything like
fine weather was encountered. Captain
Finch reports that there is a rebellion in
MfiniiU, but nevertheless vessels are char
tered to go from here to load sugar for
Nc-.v York.
Ttje Helga came here from Gape
Town in Dallas;, and rinding nothing to
do here will go in ballast to Manilla and
load for New York. The shin Oterburn,
that came here from Cape Town in bal
last, ttoes to PuÂ«r*t Sound to load lumber
for Europe, and the Miltonburn, that
also came here in ballast, hns rone to Hono
luluin ballast to load suear for New York.
With twenty-eight or thirty vessels tied
up in the bay and others leaving here in
ballast, the outlook lor sailors and ship
owneis is not very promising. '
Captain B'air, the well-known am! pop
ular master of the California, is on his
way to San Francisco again. After his
vessel was sold he went as chief officer
on one of the White Star steamers. A
month aco he was placed in command of
:he ship North Star, and will take her to
Calcutta, coming from that port to San
Francisco.

The clab having been declared organized
John H. Grady said that the benefits se
emed to the people of the Mission by
their united - efforts in the past justified
! the revival of the present club as an im
! provement union of all those who desired
; to improve that section of the City where
their homes are.
These remarks were indorsed by Vice
| President Judge VanKÂ«ynegom, who oc
j cupied the chair, and who made some
I further remarks on the. line of action to
be laid down in the immedate future.
J. Bolger offered the following resolu
tion, which was adopted : .
Whereas, The Legislature, now in session,
has indicated a disregard for public Interest,
and given our citizens great cause for alnrm
I by Die introduction of measures that are cal-
I culated to bo of no advantage or service to
I this City, namely the increase of salaries for

Resolved, That we call upon the representa
tives from the Mission district to oppose ail
such measures as inimical to the Interest of the
taxpayers and of utility.
. Ecto'vcd, That a copy of these resolutions,
properly attested, be sent to their members of
the senate and Assembly from the Mission
district.
Judge Van Reynegom desired to have
the club's indorsement on the anti-black
mailing bill, which is intended to prevent
bogus suits to secure defunct land titles.
I The club indorsad the bill and recom
| mended its passage.
A motion was made requesting Mayor
Phelan to instruct the City and County
Attorney to draft a bill authorizing the
Supervisors to purchase a lot for a hos

opposite angle. The entire front of the
little jewelry-store i? taken up as a show
window, in which are displayed tue goods
for sale. The window extends across the
entire front and around to the door, just
off the sidewaik. It was this side window
that was broken.
It is Mr. Nolte's custom to leave the
store at noon and go home to his dinner.
He always locks tbe front door and has
felt no uneasiness, as Mr. Rethey never
leaves the shoestore as he lives in the rear
of his place of business.
On Thursday, however, the shoeman
locked his door and went out to make a
purchase during the absence of the jew
eler, and when he went back he found
broken class scattered all over tbe en
trance. A glance showed him where it
had come from. A hole the size of a
man's hat bad. been broken in Nolte's aide
window and the disarranged condition of
the goods showed that a bold aurglary
hud been committed.
The strange part of it was that no one
could be fennd who had seen the thieves
or heard the crash of glass. The uolire
were called and expressed the opinion
that Ji heavy do'.h, like the skirt of a
coat, had been placed over that part of the
window before the jrlass was shattered by
tiie blow. A crowd quickly gathered from
the neighboring stores and" places of busi
ness, but none could throw any light on
the matter.
A little later Mr. Noble arrived and
rrade an inventory of his loss, and found
that the thieves had stolen only unset cat
diamonds and diamonds in rings and
shirtstuds. Thera were watches, plain
rings, lockets, chains and other valuable/
in large numbers, but none of these were
disturbed, except to be tossed about by
the hands of the thieves tÂ» hile in quest of
the precious stones.
In speakine of the burglary Mr. Noble
stated that it was no doubt committed by
persons who were familiar with his
habits.
He believes that the fellows must have
watched his place from the doorways of
several of the saloons near by for days,
waiting until such time as Mr. ilfithy, the
shoerr.aker, should go away at the same
hour. It would have been almost impos
sible for the thieves to nave broken the
window while the shoeman was in his
store, as Mr. Ketby wocld certainly have
seen any one stepping off the street into
the entntce of both stores.
Their patient waiting was at last re
warded by both storekeepers leaving their
pla. es of business at the same time.
Several detectives are at work on the
case looking lor the thieves and to recover
the stolen jewels, but so far without suc
cess, as the burglars have not, so far as
known, put the plunder in any pawnshop,
either in pawn or for sale.

NORDICA CHARMS
IN MUSIC-DRAMA
Her Interpretation of Brun
hiida Arouses Many
"Bravas."
The Baldwin Theater Is Crowded
to the Doors by Music-
Lovers.
A Miscellaneous Programme Precedes
tfae Wagner Ex:erptâ The
li Tc-N gut ,
So great was the desire to bear the
Nordica-Scalchi combination at the Bald
win Theater yesterday afteruoon that
even the fortunate possessors of seats had
almost to light their way to them, so great
was ihe crowd of music-lovers, who con
sidered it no hardship to stand in order to
hear the singers.
One reason lor the great rush was, no
doubt, the general desire to hear the
"Awakening of Brunhilda," from "Sieg
fried," which was performed with the as
sistance of an augmented orchestra.
Reports have come here from time to
time of Nordica's success in Wagner
music-drama, but it would be safe to say
that even her most ardent San Francisco
admirer was unprepared for her magnifi
cent rendering ot the "Sicgfriod" music.
"The A wakening of Brunhilda" closed
the programme aud it was well it did, for
the audience was so wrought up over the
music and Nordica's singing that to have
sat still and listened to a miscellaneous
programme afterward would have been
like dropping Jroin the sublime to
the commonplace. In the "Awakening
of Brunhilda," the warrior goddess is
lying in the long sleep into which she was
put by Wotan, when Siegfried approaches
and wakes her with a kiss. Then follows
the duet which makes the finale of "Sieg
fried."
From the moment of her awakening
until the curtain went down on Brunhiida
in Siegfried's arms, JS'ordica fainy elec
trified her hearers by her singing and
acting.
Barron Berthald, as Siegfried, did not
stand at all upon Nordica's plane. The
faults in the production of his really fine
voice were more apparent when he was
singing with the heavy orchestral sco Ting.
In lact, be had to do a good deal of good
Wagnerian shouting to make any showing
at all in the duet.
In the dramatic interpretation of Sieg
fried he was more at home than he was as
Faust, or Maurice. Isidore Luckstone
conducted his orchestra very intelligently
in the "Siegfried" excerpt and prevented
it from in any way overpowering the vocal
score.
Even in the miscellaneous portion of
the programme Noraica was in excellent ;
voic yesterday, as if the .-dea of her com- !
ing Wagner number exhilarated her. She
opened with a pretty little song "Ecstasy," !
by Mrs. Beach, followed by the charming 1
lullaby that Isidore Lucks tone composed \
for her.
The composer as well as Mrne. Nor
dica received an ovation for this soni;.
The '"Spring Song" by Weil, which con
cluded her custer of songs, called forth
aucii an ovation that Mme. Nordica re
sponded with Se Je's "Pi Basek," and as
that only whehed the tast.- for more, she
gave "When Love is Kind."
Barron Berthald's contribution to the
miscellaneous part of the programme was
Clay's "I'll Sing Thee Sones of Araby,"
and as an encore, "Love's Sorrow."
In the former number he managed the
A more carefully than on Thursday night
and succeeded in producing the effect of
a mixed tone instead of a pure falsetto.
If his phrasing had been bet;er he would
really hare sung the "Araby" song very
well, but he breathed too often to phrase
effectively. His singing of "L>ve's Sor
row" was marked by a good deal of
feeling.
Scalchi was out nf voice yesterday, par
ticularly in her first song, "Ah, rende'
me." She seemed to recover herself later,
however, and gave a line interpretation of
Seebel's second aria from Gounod's
"Faust," "Quando a te lieta," which is
too often omitted in the opere. A "So
nata," by Tosti, followed, and the audi
ence showing a thirst for more bcalchi
gave them "Annie Laurie."
This auzmented orchestra opened the
concert with tne overture to ''Tann

LITTLE PETE
MURDERED BY
HIS ENEMIES
f Continued from First Paoe.{
these document* that Buckley came to be j
designated i he "blind white devil."
"Little Pete" was tried, convictea and j
sentenced to six years in San Quentin.
Previous to that "Little Pete" had been
known from his prominent connection
with gamblers and highbinders. He was
the most famous Chinese probably in the
United States.
HIS TURF CAREER.
Plunger, Corrupter of Jockeys and
Final y Ruled Off for Fraud.
The career on tbe turf as a plunger of j
FonK Ching (or Little Pete) was as weird j
as it was meteoric. Entering the portals
of the Bay District racecourse a mild, !
meek-looking Celestial, with no more
knowledge of the horseracing game than
a parson has of faro, it was not long be
fore he had under his control three and I
possibly more of the best jockeys ruline at â 
the track, and when in March, l*O(i, he.
together with Jockeys Churn, Chevalier
and Heinrichs, was ruled off the turt by ,
the officials of the Bay District track for
fraud and jobbery, it created a great sensa
tion In the world of turf.
Little Pete made hi?" advent on the turf
during the summer of 1895 while the long
siege of racing given by the California
Jockey Club, so prolific of johs and
crooked races, was in progress. Meeting
with only ordinary success in picking
winners on form, the wily Chinaman soon
found out there were many tortuous
curves and inshoots to master before one
could hope for success, and he proved an
apt student. He soon found out that
jockeys were no different from ordinary
mortals and that glittering gold could
accomplish many thing-.
It was common gossip about the track
during the summer months that certain
jockeys were frequent visitors to the shoe
factory owned by .Pete on Wasnington
street, in Chinatown; a mention of which '
only caused a few snÂ»iles and knowing j
winks among the trainers and swipes.
It was not long before there were some ;
very suspicions looking races, and in-
Variably L tile Pete held tickets on the j
winning horse. The confidential friend
and adviser oi Little Pote in all things a; -
pertaining to turf affairs was Jockey I
Heinrichs, a mild-looking, blondÂ«-caire.l '
youth hailing from St. Louis. Heinricns
was an arti-t in the saddle, keen and
shrewd, a demon finisher, but with a very.
Very cloudy reputation as to honesty.
This glib-tongue 1, blue-eyed youth Little
Pete chose as his lirst lieutenant.
The Celestial was in the habit of back
ing the horses ridden by Heinnchs heav
i y. and invariably he cashed his tickets.
There was much talk about "dead ones"
finishing behind the winner; bnt the
judges skw not, and Little Pete was arrow
ing rich daily.
Then came the end of the long summer
rmi'ig season, a short interval of re-t and
then the auspicious opening of the fall and
â winter season of 1895-96. Many new
Eastern horses were on the scene of rac
ing operations, as well as jockeys of East
ern repute. Among these latter was Jerry
Chorn, a colored lad in tue employ of
Barney Schreiber, the St. Louis turfman,
a rider of many sterling qua] ities.
The season progressed and Little Pete.
present daily was often observed looking
over the formbook of the races run, whicb
he always carr ed In his blouse. Then a
trip to the saddling paddock, a chat with
a jockey or two ami Little Pete's commis
sioners would bÂ© seen skirmishing about
the ring placing his coin. Tales of mon
ster winnings made by the Celestial
plunger were told, to which that indivi
dual would reply that "bo backed two or
three horses in the race and only won a
trifle."
One aay the talent in general backed the
mare Wht-el o. Fortune, ridden by Chorn, I
very heavily, as she looked a certainty, j
Little P^te strung his coin on the chances !
of Rosebud, carrying the Burns <fc "Water- I
house colors, and strangely enough the j
judgment of the little man from China- I
town proved superior to that of Caucasian J
race-goers of many years' experience. I
Chorn's ride on this occasion was viewed j
with suspicion by many, but no action i
was taken in the matter by the officials in '
the judges' stand.
As the meeting draegei through the
long winter months and merged into
spring, elated at his successes, Pete en
gaged in a book-making venture. At this
he was only partially successful, as it was
whispered about that one or two horses
laid up wit i his book, supposedly "dead
ones," were resuscitated, and the book
lost heavily. On top of this came a
rumor of a rupture between Pete and
his trusted lieutenant, Jockey Heinrichs.
The cause of this was, it was said, jealousy
on the part of the jockey that other
Jockeys who were getting better mounts
were usurping his Dlace In :he good graces
of the plunger from the land of the
Flowery Kingdom.
In the latter part of March, 1896, mat- i
ters came lo a focus ami the racing world I
was treated to a startling surprise. At a
meeting he'd one evening by the Board of
(Stewards of the California Jockey Club four j
or live jockeys were summoned before |
them and closely questioned regarding i
some very suspicions looking riding that !
had been viewed from the stand. Murder j
will out, and it was claimed that Joclcey
Heinric s, under promise of a lenient sen- j
tence, let the cat out of the bag, and the
Chinese confederacy was a thing of the
past. Ai any rate, much silence was ob
served by the jockey club officials regard
ing how the information was gleaned.
After a searching inquiry jockeys Ohorn
and Chevalier were ruled off the turf for I
life and Heinrichs and plunger Fong I
Ching were warned off the turf.
Many tales of wondrous winnings were
told about the little yellow man, but as
be was of a secretive turn of mind they j
were never verified and how much he
added to his wealth during nis open ca
reer on the turf will probably never be
known. That he became a fiend to the i
frame is certain, lor even after being ruled
off he sent money to the track to be played ;
on certain horse?.
Jockey Hcinrichs is now riding on an
outlaw tract in the Jkast, Chevalier, the
colored boy, is an cxi c from his native
land, pilo<in;< nor eÂ« over the race courses
of Guatemala. Jtrry Chorn, it is said, is
a penniless hanger on about the race
tracks of St. Louis and the prime mover
in the gigantic turf swindles occupies a
slab in the City Morgue.

City and County Hospital
Can House No More
Patients.
As a Result of Varied Filchings
the Maternity Ward Is
Closed
The Emergency Cases Are for the
Present Cared for at the Re
ceiving Hcspital.
As a result of the looting of the funds
provided by the City to repair it and
make it passably fit for occupancy, a seri
ous crisis now confronts the City and
j County Hospital. The institution is
I taxed to its capacity to accommodate
patients, and in a day or so the Board of
Health will close its doors to further ap
! plicants.
The condition of affairs as far as the
poor sick and disabled are concerned is
very serious. Owing to the neglect of the
1 former management of the hospital to re-
I pair certain sewers it has been found
; necessary to close the maternity ward.
This has resulted in a transfer of this
class of patients to the children's nursery
and a corresponding cramping and crowd
ing throughout the entire building. It is
possible that this ward may be reopened
{ in a few days, but this would be but a
I temporary relief. The capacity of the
building has already been reached.
There are now 393 patients in tho hospi
tal, the largest number in its history.
Three cases applied for admission yes
terday. The resident pnysician rejected
two of them because he was unable to
house the patients. The third was an
emergency affair and the sick man was
accommodated by resurrecting some old
beds from the basement and drawing on
the maternity war i for some bed clothing.
In two of the wards the operating-rooms
Â»ye been transformed into sick chambers.
The transfer of the maternity ward to the
children's nursery has left the little ones
no place to romp but the big long corri
dors.
There are now fully 100 cases in thÂ»
hospital that properly reiong to the Alms
house. This number "is made up of chronic
sick and infirm, whose condition while not
serious enough to warrant their detention
in an emergency institution sum as a
hospital is designed to bo is yet of such a
nature as to make it impossible to turn
them adrift. Now the Aimshouse is lull
in the fullest sense of the word. .Inmates
are sleeping on the floor, unable to get
beds, and relief in this direction Superin
tendent Reddy declares is out of the
question.
A woman applied for admission to the
j hospital the other day. yhe was given
refuge in an improvised room, but the
resident physician has mnce refused three
similar applications. The Receiving Hos
pital has been temporarily Tressed into
sfirvic?, but there is danger, too, ihat its
capacity will be all required in a day or
i so. Then this big town will have no shei
; ter for its unfortunate sick.
The Board of ileaith'is at its wits' end
in the dilemma. Every effort js being
made to relieve the congestion by having
the sewers temporarily repaired under the
maternity ward, but to do this it will be
necessary to draw on the general funds of
the buiiding, and the appropriation is al
most exhausted. While contractors have
been grossly overcharging for insignificant
repairs, the sick and unfortunate hive
found the doors closed to them. Unless
ttie maternity war. can be reopened by
February 1, the Board of Health will de
clare lhe City and County Hospital close.l
to further comers.
It is conceded that had the repnirs ap
propriation bÂ»en carefully expended tins
emergency would not have arisen. The
drainage of two of the wards could have
been improved i-o as to render them
habitable for any case. Should the re
ceiving hospital become overcrowded the
City will either have to p vide some tem
porary emergency shelter or become re
sponsible lor criminal neglect in the mat
ter of its sicfe.
The investigation of the book 1 * is pro
gressing. The neglect of ex-Sieward
R >binson to close up his records for De
cember renders it very liiflicult to proceed
alone the lines of probing n.t i the way in
which supp.ies were purchased. Rotrin
son w;ib yesterday requested again to bal
ance his accounts, but gave an evasive
answer.
It is rumored that Contractor Mulcreavy
may attempt to justuy Ins false measure
ments for concrete work by arguing ttiat
the cement is of extra thickness. The
other people who tad contracts for repairs
have remained silent.
Tue Board of Health will probably hold
a special meeting the coming week to dis
cuss the advisability of appealing to the
Grand Jury.

Adequate Street Railway
Service Premised Carl-
Street Residents.
An Enterprising Improvement
Club Induces the Company
to Make Concession.
The Board of Supervisors Petitioned
by Property-Owners to Grant
the Franchise.
The residents of the district south of
the Panhandle, or at least that portion of
the district whose interests are looked
after by the Astibury Heights and
Stanyan-street Improvement Club, be
lieve that after much contention they are
on the eve of bavins an adequate street
railway service, and they are consequently
elated.
For many months past the service in
this district has been distressingly meager
aim irregular. At one time the Market
street Railway Company took the cars off
Carl street entirely, and arier much
protest consented to make a few trips at
remote intervals during the day. The
residents protested vigorously, and finally
instituted a suit to have the franchise of
the old Metropolitan road annulled.
This had its effect, for the railroad com
pany consented to listen to their de
mands, and after consultation with the
improvement clubs and other property
owners, the company agreed to give
a satisfactory service if a franchise could
be secured for a road a few blocks more
extensive than that which tbey now hold.
A meeting of the Ashbury Heights and
Stanyan-sireet Improvement Club va<
held at 137 Curl street last evening to take
final stens in the matter.
Fred J. Koster, president of the club,
slated that the object of the meeting was
to petition trie Board of Supervisors to
grant the Market-street Railway Company
a franchise enabling it to operate a street
railway on Masonic avenue, between Oak
and Pace streets; also on Clayton street,
from Frederick to Carl, thence to Cole
street. Heexplained that the matter was
expected to come before the board to
morrow.
E. N. Fritz said that he had seen the
franchise, which provided for a fifteen
minute service. "I objected to ihut," he
' said, ''and Mr, Lyncn assured me that
| there would be a ten-minute service.
j They will change the franchise in regard
I to the limit ;or completing the ro;id from
three year?, as they first contemplated, to
I ninety days."
A resolution calling upon the board to
grant the franchise a; prepared was read
by D. L. West over and, after some discus
: sion, was passed unanimously. A peti-
I ton to ihe same effect which had been
' cirru!ated among property-owners and
, numerously signed was also subscribed
\ by the members of the cub.
The dis.rict to be affected by the in
! creased transportation facilities is one o
j the most rapidly improving sections of
j the City, and the residents feel that the
I assurance which they now have of a regu
i lar street railway service will be a great
j benefit to the community. The Improve
nient Club, which has been very active in
agitating the matter, is officered by Fred
J. Knster, president; W. B. Walkup, vice
president; A. J. Fritz, secreiary, and F.
M. LangÂ«>, treasurer. It has an enthusiastic
men. bership. ,_
ALL KINDS OF POLITICS.
The Municipal Campaign Develops Into
a Go-AÂ«-You-PleHÂ»e Contest.
Oakland Office San FraScisco Call, >
908 Broadway, Jan. 23. )
Every club or organization political is
now bursting into new life for the March
election. Independent candidates are
running around with petitions, politicians
of all creeds have announced that the
exigencies of the moment demand that
party lines cannot be considered in
municipal politics, and a lively campaign
is assured.
Although Mr. Towle, who was the
opponent of Captain Thomas in the Re
publican convention for Mayor, has stated
that he will not run independently,
there is a vague idea in the air that the
Municipal League will nomihate him for
the office now held by Davie and that he
wiil be forced, through the importunities
of friends, to run as a candidate.
This evening J. W, Dutton, president of
the Navy and Army Bryan Free-silver
League, gathered together the members
and held a meeting in Becker's Hall. A
general discussion was held as to the
po-ition the league should take in local
politics, but nothing definite was decided
upon, and the league will meet again next
week.
It is, however, given out that the leazue
will indorse the independent candidacy
of John L. Davie.
The Municipal League will certainly
take a hand in the campaign, which wiJl
probably consist of drawing up a platform
and indorsing all those candidates who
will pledge themselves to accept it. They
will meet next Tueadav night to perfect
their arrangements. r
Among the county officials there is no
more harmony tban among municipal
oilice-holders. County Clerk Jordan bas
induc-d Senator Stratton to introduce a
bill in the Lagislature referring to the
rrenaration oi the military roll. County
Assessor Dalton does not view the pro
rosed measure with any approval but
Jordan has statea that if Dalton attacks
the bill or tries to prevent its passage be
will take up th â¢ light in another direction
and will take steps to diminish the emolu
ments of the Assessor's office.
The proposed hill is of interest to every
Assessor and County Clerk in the State.
"It h a very simple measure and its pas
sage would be but justice to the County
Clorks throughout the State," said Mr.
Jordan to-day. "As the old law stands
now it provides that the County Assessor
shall prepare the roll ana deliver it to
the County Clerk, who, after its approval
by the Supervisors, must mÂ»ke two copies
to send one each to the adjutant-general
and the briga-iier-general. Tne Assessor
receives 5 cents a name, or about $1000 a
year for this roll-making, bat the County
Clerk is ocliged to prepare two copies
with no compensation whatever.
"The bill as introduced instructs the
Assessor to make triplicate copies when
the first is prepared and deliver the orig
inal, with two corrected ones, to the
Clerk. After the Board of Supervisors
makes the necessary corrections, which
amounts to little, the Cierk certifies to
the roll as required.
"The matter is just this way: The As
sessors can use typewriters* and make
three copies at the same time, without
any additional expense. It works no
hardship on them, but it does to the
County Clerks wao receive nothing for
the extra labor Derformed oy them while
the A>ses3ors are more than liberally c m
pensated.
"The County Clerks all over this State
have made a protest against what they
claim is an unfair law. They are all in
iavor of the amendment introduced hv
Senator Stratton." uy

SIGNS OF WINTER
BOOM TRAVEL
The Number of Arrivals
Increasing and Hotels
Doing Well.
But the Tide From the East Is
Late and Is Always so After
a Campaign.
The Rise in Wheat, Beef and Wina
Has Greatly Stimuated tha
Coast Travel.
Altbouch the winter boom in travel does
not usually set in before February 1, there
has been something of an increase in the
arrivals here for some little time. It is
believed that from this on there will be a
considerably greater increase in travel.
Local or California and coast travel has
been stimulated by the higher prices for
wheat, beef and wine. The producers of
beef have been especially in evidence here
during the Jast two or three week*. As
they always have their pockets full of
money and buy things with a good deal of
freedom, they are welcomed with fully
the usual amount of cordiality. V
While the experiences of hotel pro- f
prieiors are different, as are the hotels
from each other, a better business is, on
the average, noticeable. Ai the Palace it
is stated tiiat while the arrivals have not
during the winter been heavy, neither
have the departures. Those that cam*
have siayed, and the hotel has been kept
pretty well tilled right a.ong.
Colonel Young of the Rubs House said
yesterday in regard to tne increase of
travel: "It is picking up a good, deal. It
is not as good as it was a year ago, but it
has begun to improve noticeably in the
last few days. Tourists from the East and
minimr men, cattlemen and business m<sn
have b"en on the increase. The outlook:
is better than it has been for some time."
George Hooper of the Occidental said
that business was pretty fair, nut not quite
as good as last year. "The travel is later,"
he continued, "and it is the same way in
Southern California. The chances are it
will hold on longer. But business is good.
We have had a full house for a mouth
past. People are staving well."
"Travel is a shaje better now than it has
been, said Manager Some of the Lick;
"but the East has not started yet. Local
travel is belter. It will be better generally
from this op for a while, and I think it is
conceded that it will improve, because we
have big crops everywhere and the mines
are, generally speaking, doing well. 1 '
The Cali;ornia and Baldwin are re
ported to be doing a pretty good business.
Of the Grand, Manager Thorn yesterday
sai.i:
"Looking ahead at present 1897 looks
well after March and the inauguration
ceremonies. Travel ought to bo consider
ably increased by the proposed Golden
Gate Carnival and several National gather
ings here, prominent among which is the
Christain Endeavor convention, second
week in July. Ail will tend to increase
our number of visiiors. We are now re
ceiving some considerable benefit by traTf i
incidental to the present >ession of the
Legislature, hut our trade is not up to the
â¢years of 1890-91-92, probably on account of
(^construction of so many family hotels."BILLS AFFECTING
LOCAL INDUSTRIES

P. J. Healy's Powerful Plea for
Preserving the State Min
ing Bureau.
Proposed Acts Regulating Sanitation
and Pure Food Approved by
the Council
The Council of Associated Industries
met yesterday in the Mills buHding and
tooK action on various bills affecting Cali
fornia trade and manuhicturing and other
interests. Julian Sountag occupied the
chair, and E. A. Denicke, James W. Kerr,
W. W. Montague, I. Jacobs, P. J. Healy,
U. N. Rowley, K. P. Heald and L. F.
Lastreto were present
The committee appointed by the council
to consider the bill regarding the appoint
ment of a State food commissioner and
assistants made the following report,
which was adopted:
We have come to the unanimous conclusion
thai this a question oi the most vital impor
tance to the Male. The use aud sale of adul.
-teraied foods of all kinds Is prevalent 10 an
extraordinary degree. We have discovered
that there are many laws on the statute boots !
hptiinsi this terrible evil to our people, the
State and its interests. In fact, no further
lawe on the subject are necessary, as the pres
ent laws luily cover the situation if they were
fca :orced.
We are confronted with the fact that for the
first time in the history of tnis State this sub
ject is receiving vigorous attention through
the work inaugurated by the Board of Heal t n
of this City, bui have come to the conclusion
that ironi actual investigation the p-irties
guilty of these great iraud.s on the public will
never receive their ju^t dues in tne present
manner of handling these cases before the
Police Courts of this City.
We will cite, as an instance, that twenty ar
!â â¢ sts m the past two weeks by the Chiet Food
Inspector of this City tor adulteration in milk
resulted in seventeen acquittals and three con
victions, the latter being fined without any
alternative of imprisonment, resulting in
practically no fine at all. It is apparent to j
you.- committee that couvictions catmo: be
obtained nnlesa through and by the efforts of j
general public opinion, voiced, us it should be,
through the editorial columns oi the press of
this City. Several of our leading newspapers
tuok up ihis subject some time since,
but spasmodic and iar-bitween efforts will not i
accomplish results, 'ihe Judges will become i
lax when public interest cea*< 6, and the press
is the great engine that can carry this work
through to a successful issue.
Tnere are four Police Court? in this City, the
calendars ure irequent'y crowded, and 'sand- i
wiched in between drunts, battery, etc,
are the cases of violation oi I'ood-adulteratiou
laws.
The Board of Health of this City has no
attorney to prosecute these cases in the Police
Court.-, and n it had, it would take up near.y
The entire time ana attention oi the attorney.
Therefore they are frequently dismissed witn
<>ut a hearing, either to.rough political in
fluence or a lack oi prosecution.
Your committee suggests that more efficient
results could be obtainei it one Police Court
would try all this character of cases, and
thereby the Judge would become familiar with
the work.
It is quite possible that in a short time
there may be sufficient work in this line to
keep one of the courts busy nearly the entire
time. Tile question is, Can one 01 the Police â 
Judges be found who will undertake this |
brunch of criminal cases? At present we are |
told none of ihe''fudgeÂ» care particularly to
handle them, and the cases, are bandied
around from one to the other.
It is apparent to your committee that the j
subject if food adulteration is not generally !
recognieed as being of the importance mat it I
16. In many instances human lives depend
upon the purifying of our food products, and ]
in other instances many of our industries and i
manufactures and the reputation of our State
is at state. The question then is whether this
great movement is worthy of attention from
our people and the Dress, or should it be rele
gated to the background in favor oi matters of
minor importance?
We recommend that the Council of Asso
ciated Industries of this State appoint b pure- I
food committee, to consist of one member se- I
lectea from each of the organizations em
braced in its geDsral membership, the said
committee to look into the subject of general
food adulteration nnJ to act, if necessary, in
an advisory capacity with such bodies os
may be charged with the enforcement of laws
oa the subject. We further lecommend that
a communication be addressed to the different
organizations comprised in the membership
of this council, inclosing a copy of this report,
and asking them to decare themselves regard- j
Ing this important subject.
Your committee further recommends that
the bill referred to them as amended be in
dorsed by this council.
We believe that there should be some re
sponsible head to this movement in this State.
A State Commissioner wouM suon district j
the State so tnat the work could be carried on !
In a systematic and thorough manner.
According to the bill as amended, every Dis- !
trict Attorney and ProsecutiDg Attorney in j
the State would become an agent of tne !
in the enforcement of the laws against the!
adulteration in rood, drink or drugs.
This system has been working -successfully
In many of the Eastern and Western States,
notabiv in Ohio, where the plan has been la
pucceshful operation for the past ten years, re
sulting in thousands of convictions yearly.
The proposed bill aims to provide efficient in- j
spection and prosecution throughout the Slate j
by making three inspection districtsâNorth- !
em. Central and Southern .California. Yours, i
very truly, P. J. Heai.y, Chairman. â¢

issue subyvnas for witnesses and compel
attendance of witnesses beiore such
boards, and also to confer upon these
boards power to adopt and pass ordinances
relating to sanitation, were discussed.
James W. Kerr protested that the bills
gave too* much power to boards of health;
the power of enacting laws seemed too
sweeping.
I. Jacobs cited the present scandal of
the City and County Hospital, where ne
said "the most flagrant thefts and rob
beries have been committed in the past
few months," but ihe Board of Health
waÂ« powerless to investigate them.
\V. ">V. Montague said that the City
should not be run by a boaru of health;
these bilis ho deemed too sweeping in
their character. Bht the following reso
lutions were adopted:
WHXBEAB, There are two bills now pending
beiore vie Legislature in relation to ihe pow
ers 01 the Hoards ol Health in the cities and
counties of tn's State: 'he iÂ»aid bills are AÂ«
sembly t.iUs ;!74 and 375 and Senate bills 3J.9
and 3JH); n i;<i whereas, it is manifest that
Boards or Health should have the necessnry
authority to deal with all matters concerning
the public health of the community tind to
have the authority to issue subpenas and sum
mon witnesses in investigations held before it;
therefore, be it
Resolved, 13y the Council of Associated In
dustries, thÃt v>o recommend to the Legisla
ture the adoption of the bills enumerated
heretofore, as we consider them vitally neces
sary to the best interests of public health in
this State.
Jicsoivcd, Further, that a copy of these reso
lutions be sent to the judiciary committees of
the Senate and Assembly, to the Speaker of
the House, to the Pres.deut of the Senate and
to each member of the .Senate ami Assembly,
urging their lavorable action in this matter.
E. A. Denicke moved that the committee
indorse the bill appropriating $70,000 for
the California display in the Om.iha Exhi
bition of 1898. The motion was carried.
The bill indorsed by the Miners' Asso
ciation and now before the Legislature
was submitted by Montague. He said it
was necessary to nmend the bill which
appropriated "$250,000 for construction of
debris impounding dams to make it con
fcrm with the United States Government
requirements in order that the $_5O,0(.O ap
propriated by Congress might be secured.
The amendmeuts were favored by a unani
mous vote.
Montague presented a bill now before
the Legislature. It gives power to citizens
of other States to attach for debts in Cali
fornia. "While it looks very nice on its
face," said Mr. Montague, "the effect of
tin- bill would be to increase the of
Eastern men in California, because it
would protect them in their dealings. If
they sell goods here at siny days, they
collect by draft, and if that, be not forth
coming they levy an attachment right off.
We know here that 2 per centum of the
country merchants pay promptly. East
ern men care nothing abotit our customers,
whom we carry from one season to an
other. This seems to me to bean infamous
bill, fathered by the Code Commission
ers "
"A rocky bill," interrupted the chair.
"We can't go into another Slate and put
on an attachment," continued Montague.
"This thine; is done in the interest of
Eastern men; it would Have the effect of
bursting up half the merchants ot Cali
fornia."
The council declared itself opposed to
the proposition. Messrs. Kerf and Row
ley were appointed a committee to confer
with Assemblymen and the Miners' Asso
ciation on the matter.
An act to amend an act entitled "An
act appropriating $40,000 for the purpose
of the establishment and management of
the Industrial Home for Mechanical
Trades for the Adult BMnd of t::e State of
California," approved March 5, ISBS, and
prescribing the duties of ti.e officers
thereof and of the State officers in refer
ence thereto was approved by the council.
P. J. Healv introduced the question of
the Mining Bureau. He wanted the bu
reau preserved for this City as an educa
tional factor. "It is our duty," he added,
"as citizens of this City and State, to pre
serve this bureau in its present scope of
action, and rather than have its appropri
ation curtailed we ought to petition the
Legislature for an increased appropriation
for it, and to make that allowance perma
nent, that the work of the bureau may be
continuous in its action. In this connec
tion it has been a mistake for San Fran
cisco not to insist on a State buildins, in
which all State departments should be
housed."
He moved that Mr. Montague be re
quested to bring upthe matter bafore the
Miners' Association at its next session,
and the motion was earned.
A resolution was carried in the interest
of the fight against convict-made articles
imported to California.
WILD WITH GEIEF.
Sirs. Louise Huntir Searching for the
Father of Her Children.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelly to Children have in
hand a case not entirely devoid of inter
est, inasmuch as it involves the care of
five little children who to a great extent
have been thrown upon the cold charity
of the world. About a week ago a Mrs.
Louise Hunter arrived from Eureka, Cal.,
with two little children, and she took
from a children's home in Oakland three
other of her offspring who had been there
for a year or so. Bhe took her little ones,
who range in ages from 14 to 3 years, to
a room oa First street, near Howard,
where she lived in seclusion, seidom leav
ing her apartments. The family was pro
vided with food by the landlady, but
within a day or so the case r ached the
ears of the officers of the humane society,
who at once made an investigation.
To them Mrs. Hunter stated that her
husband, Fremont Hunter, a lumberman,
deserted her in Eureka about the lime of
the disappearance of a woman named Mc-
Grill. That was abotv three months ago
and she came to San Francisco in hopes of
finding the man. She believed from what
she can learn ih.st he did not stop here
long but went to Mexico. One of the girls
she hired out to a tamale man in Alameda
for ?5 a month and the socie;y's officers
are now hunlin" for the child, who is but
9 years of age. Yesterday when the officers
called upon Mrs. Hunter they found her
in a condition that warranted them in
sending the woman to the Receiving
Hospital. They fear that her sorrow has
caused her to re>ort to opiates or stimu
lants. At any rate she is not fit to take
care of the children, three of whom were
?ent to the YouthV Directory. The doc
tors advise that Mrs. Hunter be sent to
the City and County Hospital.
A SPURIOUS DIVOKCE.
The Charge of Bigamy Agnlnst Charles
I>. Dinckiey Is Dismissed.
Charles D. Dmckley, an old man charged
with bigamy, had his case dismissed by
Judge Joachimsen yesterday as it was
shown that he had acted in good faith in
marrying his second wile.
In 1893 Dinckiey employed a man named
Collins to procure a divorce for him. Col
lins represented himself a3 an attorney
and Dinckiey paid him a fee of $50. In a
few days Collins handci Dinckiey a docu
ment signed "JuciKe Proutt," which he
slated wrs a decree of divorce. The docu
ment was produced in court by Attorney
Walter Gallagher, who represented the de
fendant and the J udf;e saw at once how
easily a man of DmcU: ley's education had
been imposed upon.
Witnesses were put upon the stand to
testify to Dinckiev's good character and
the Juilge said he failed to see any crim
inal intent and dismissed the case.

THE SAN FR AS CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 1897.
SPOOKS SAY THAT
BUTLER IS BAD
He Carries Along a Small
Arsenal on the Swan
hilda.
Jack the Ripper's Spirit Has
Warned Him of the Wait
ing Sleuths.
Guns May Pop and a Whole Barrel of
Ammunition Be Fired Off Before
He Yields.
Another class of visitors has found
Meiggs wharf, and unlike the others they
come not to question but to inform. With
an innpr eye they have followed the Swan
hilda in her wanderings over the South
Pacific across the great equatorial belt and
up throujjh the northern latitudes. They
are me spirits, whether of just men made
perfect or not they bave noi told, but ac
cording to their deep-sea yarns they are
marine observers of a high visual power.
Yesterday two of these tourist spooks
are alleged to have fluttered down to the
Meiggs wharf police station and in the
persons of their medium, who only was
visible to the mortals on the dock, gave a
message that made glad the hearts of
watching detectives.
The Swanhilda, the medium said, is
now only a few miles off s-bore, and will
be sighted to-day even by human eyes.
Butler is on board of the ship, and await
ing the approach of the revenue cutter
and the arresting officers as anxiously as
they are for his coming.
Furthermore, the spirits say, through
the medium, Butler is "heeled." 10 use a
very earthy term, for his visitors, and will
shower a large cargo of cold lead around
their ears when they draw near the Swan
hilda's gangway.
One mystic old party, with his unseen
familiar, interviewed McHattie, and while
with the Ausiralian detective went into a
trance. He said Butler had been notified
by the spook of Jack the Kipper that the
officers were waiting for him and the first
man who stepped aooard of the Swan
hilda to arrest him will dip, as Butier is
armed with a revolver, a rifle and a dag
ger, in his bunk he has four other guns
and a barrel of ammunition.
When be goes aloft to help handle a
sail he carries his three weapons with him
and leaves them in the top while he lavs
out on the yard. When he takes his trick
at the wheel l\e places his battery on the
binnacle for instant use. He advised the
officers to make the arrest in the Caman
che or some other armored cruiser instead
<>f the peaceable revenue cutter Hartley.
Deputy United States Marshal Bouner
will take the matter under advisement.
The British ship Morialta arrived yes
terday from Newcastle and was quickly
boaraed by the officers for news. She
sailed seventeen days before the Swau
hiida and was seventy-eight days out.
Her skipper, Capiain Lindsav, could give
bo information regarding Butler or his
ship. The Morialta experienced much
n u^h weather and head winds, which
held her back for a long passage. Some
damage was done the vessel by the seas
that boarded her and the cargo shifted in
the heavy rolling.
II the Swannilda caught the same gales
her absence may in a measure be ac
counted for.
According to a report in the Melbourne
i Age, Captain Petrie of British ship Olive-
I bank, which is now due from Newcastle,
j will have a tale to tell of Butler when the
i vessel geis in. The published statement
; in the Melbourne journal is to the effect
that Butler, under the name of Richard
Ashe, came to Newcastle on the Oiivebniik
in 1893, having shipped at Rio Janeiro.
i He was very troublesome aboard ship and
i threatened to kill Captain Petrie.
For this he was sentenced to one month's
imprisonment and served that length of
! time in jail. Butler is reported by a for
| nier :Â»hipmate to have said that if he ever
j met Petrie again he would blow tnat skip
' per's brains out. If be has arms aboard
I the Swanhilda, or can procure some k;nd
j ot a weapon for defense, he will in all
j probability make a reckless, and of course
I a losing, fight when the detectives over
' haul the Swanhilda. However, he will
meet with a warm reception should he
object seriously to his visitors.
In the meantime the Mei^gs wharf
I squad are preparing for their usual Sun
| day clam chowder dinner, which will be
! served in the afternoon watch to-day.
j Sergeant Bonner is a famous chef along
I the~chowder line and McHattie will take
! a recipe for the toothsome mixture when
he returns to Australia with Butler.
The Morialta, a brigantine Lark from
j Newcastle, N. S. W., got in last night, af
ter a passage of seventy-seven days' dura
tion. She reported heavy winds and in one
place a high cross-sea, which shifted the
cargo. Her captain does not report hav
ing spoken or even seen the much looked
for STranhilda. The latter vessel ha? only
been out sixty-three days and probably has
| encountered much of the same class of
weather. Following is the full memoran
dum filed by the captain ot the Morialia:
Per Morialta, British bark, from Newcastle,
N. S. \V.. January 23â Sailed from Newcastle,
N. S. W., on November.7; had south-southwest
winds to latitude 32 south, longitude 108 west;
hnd south-southeast winds to latitude 28
south'; had easterly and variable winds to
latitude 13 south; had northeast and easterly
winds to latitude 6 south ; crossed the equator â 
on December 14 in longitude 157.21 west;
had strong northeast winds and gales lrom
latitude 0 south to latitude 21 north; on De
cember 24, In atitude 19 north, lo.igltude 161
nest, had a very heavy east-northeast gale
lasting forty-eight hours, with a very high
cross sea, shitted cargo to port. These gales
THE CAT AND THE COCOANUTS.
After all. Con Mooney's cat may not be the ferocious beatt that Secretary Hol
brook of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals believes.
"Your Honor," s-aid Attorney Treadwell, Con's counsel, to Judge Conlan,
"we would like to call your attention to the fact that this cat in ques
tion, held as evidence, was a meek and mild feline of a back-fence domesticated
nature. Since its term of detention in the dark corridors beneath this hall, where
it has been viewed by scores of people daily, and where the trusties In charge
have helped to pone it into a frenzy with aggravating sticks and canes, the poor
animal has become wild, indeed.
"It would be Dut a humone act to allow Mr. Mooney, my client and the owner
of the bat, to take iiim or her awa}\ Therefore, I beg, in the name of humanity,
that an order to that effect be issued."
"Where did you ever see a cat like that in a domesticated condition, Mr.
Treadwell?" asked Jude;e Conlan.
"In Mexico, your Honor!" exclaimed Mr. Treadwell; "where we purrel
almost side by side in our youth beneath tne cocoanut tree."
"I expect po, 1 ' answered his Honor. "There are about as many cocoanut trees
in your country as there are tame cats, Buch as that ugly b^ast in the cage down
stairs. AH right; I'll give you an order to remove the cat, providing lam as
sured it will not be allowed to enter into any controversy with dogs or other ani
mals. We may possibly nee lit in evidence whsn this case comes up again."
An amusing part of the proceedings when Cornelius Mooney was before the
bar to answer on a charge of attempting to bring off a fight between a cat and a
dog is that there was no attorney ready to conduct the prosecution. Attorneys
Dud'ey, Lawler, Rix, Pinjo, Gray, Qainlan and others having been requested to
act in vain.
The difficulty struck Judge Conlan in auch a humorous way that he laugh
ingly remarked :
"It is evident that every attorney within a radius of four blocks has been re
tained by Mr Mooney. The case will, therefore, go over until Thursday, that
Mr. Holbrook may get some one to represent him."
The cat has been removed from the jail to Mooney's more comfortable quar
ters at Sierra Pars, on the road to Baden.

Heart Disease Carries Oil" a :,aly Well
Known .to Many .People.
Mrs. Amelia A. Connor died yesterday
at her home, 1236 Market street, at the age
of WJ years. There are in this City hun
dreds of people who remember Mrs. Con
nor, not only well but. kindly ana with
gratitude. She came from her home in
Bangor, Me., in 1559 with her family and
early in her womanhood she was married
to Captain Francis Connor, who for many
years was master on the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Improvement Com
pany's steamers. In time he was pro
moted to the honorable and responsible
position of "Commodore' of tiie fleet.
He held this position until the day of his
death in 1880.
During the life of Her husband Mrs.
Connor was a great entertainer in their
home on Folsom street, near First, Rincon
Hili, which was then the Sob Hill of San
Francisco. Since his death Mrs. Connor
has lived a more retired live, but she never
forgot her earlier friends nor aid they for
get her.
Durinp the last twelve or fourteen years
Mrs. Connor has devoted much of her
time and means to acts of charity, and it
is stated that never in her life has a
wortny person left her door unassisted.
For several years Mrs. Connor has been
afflicted with heart troubles, and this ail
ment was what brought her life to such a
sudden end yesterday morning.
The funeral will be helu to-morrow, and
the remains will be interred in the family
pat in Odi; Fellows' Cemetery, where her
husband and several of the family repose.
It is probable that Mrs. Ada Ballou will
officiate at the funeral. Mrs. Connor's re
maining relatives are her sister, Mrs. W.
K. Leveridfce of this city, a brother, Cap
tain Henry H. Webb of Honolulu, and
Mrs. Samuel A. Sanderson of Peralta
Park, Berkeley.
Scared a Motorman.
The report of an attempt to hold up an elec
tric cor was investigated by Policeman J.
Standley of the Mission district and the result

MINERS' BILL
IS ADOPTED
Text of the Proposed Meas
ure to Be Submitted
to Congress.
AGREE AFTER A FULL
DISCUSSION.
It Makes Provision for Better
Mining Laws Regarding
Titles.
ALL SECTIONS OF THE STATE
REPKESESTED.
A Committee Appointed to Investigate
the Condition cf the Mining
Bureau.
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Miners' Association met last night at
the Union League Club for the purpose of
taking action on the proposed bills to be
laid before Congress in the; interest of min
ing. There was quite a full representation
oi miners from various j ar:s of the State,
among those present being : J. H. Neff,
chairman; Mark B. Kerr, A. H. Ten
Broeck, J. H. Roberts, Jud^e Belcher,
Tirey L. Ford, E. C Loitus, S. K. Thorn
ton, W. W. Mod tag tie, S. J. Hendy,
Harold T. Power, James J. O'Brien, E.
Coleman, Curtis II- Lindley, C. W. Cross
and H. E. Picicett.
Secretary Julian Sonntag read letters
from Senators and Representatives bcar
inrr on the mining bill; from William M.
StÂ« wart, stating that he could not see wby
i !', ere should be any' failure to enact the
ji.l into a law at this session and assuring
his full support of the measure; from
Francis G. Newlands to the effect that the
matter has been given his attention and
when it comes up it will receive his
support.
i ;. Hilborn's leUer announced that he
would do all he coulc'. to forward the pas
sage of the bill. James McLachlan de
clared he was heartily in favor of the bill
and that he would do everything in his
power to secure immediate action upon it.
Senator George W. McÃride wrote that at,
a member of the Public Lands Committee
which had considered tt.e bill at the last
session oi Congress he g&ive it his earnest
support. Senator Stephen M. White's
letter was an assurance iJaat he would con
tinue to exert himself to bis utmost to
procure the enactment of the measure.
He wrote that if Mr. Reed would consent
to its presentation to the House it would
undoubtedly T'nss, but S^jiator White was
afraid that Mr. Reed woe Id refrain from
favorable action. Representative Binger
Hermann of Orezon stated in his letter
that, with other Pacific Coast delegates,
lie had culled upon the Spejiker and urged
upon him the necessity for the passage of
this bill.
lion the Speaker now depended the
success of the measure.
Representative Charles Hartman of
Montana wrote that he would be glad to
extend any aid he could to the delegation
in Washington and to securing the pas
sacre of the bill.
-Representative Loud assured the com
mittee by letter that he would continue to
use such influence as lay in his power to
further the interests of the bill.
Senator George C Perkins wrote: "I
shall give the matter my careful atten
tion. I have already personally inter
viewed."
Secretary Sonntag read the' amended
bill as presented by Cnrti3 H. Lindley,
chairman of the committee on revision
of mining laws. A. H. Ricketts and J.
T. Halloran opposed the proposed measure
in long communications which, However,
were not considered.
The bill was then taken up for discus
sion. Section 11 proved to be a stumbling
block, as both Lindley and Ford agreed
that it was in violation of the constitu
tional provision which requires the sub
ject matter of the bill to be contained in
i'ie title. Section 11 referred to annual
reports of labor periormed for assessment
work. Ford moved tbat it be stricken out
and the title of the bill remodeled. The
motion was carried, and Cross added that
he was entirely satisfied with the bill.
So the section affecting assessment- work
reports was left as it is in the act of 1891.
The gravel men were not content with
the bill, since it dealt with the require
ment for marking within twenty days.
They argued that it was often as difficult
to locate gravel claims as quartz veins,
and they wanted sixty days for marking.
All seemed in favor of this revision, and
it was adopted on motion.
Samuel K. ThorntDn moved that the
bill be adopted as amended. Everyboay
present voted aye.
Tirey L. Ford moved that Representa
tive Power of Placer introduce the bill in
the Assembly. The motion was carried,
and Mr. Power thanked the committee for
the honor. He will select a Senator to
introduce it in the Senate. The bill is as
follows:
An act prescribing the manner of locating
and relocating mining claims and :nill sites

Curtis H. Lindlev moved that it be de- j
clared the sense of the committee that the ',
mechanics' lien law be amended so that
a lien may be filed by the assignee of the
party originally entitled to file it. hÂ£S|
Judge Soward amended to have this ap- I
ply only to miners, and the amendment I
was adopted.
. W. W. Montague stated that he believed |
the salary of $300 a month was too large j
for the debris commissioner. Tirey L.
Ford spoke in favor of paying the -alary
as he believed that the man selected for
the important office was worth it. Mr.
Montague added that his main objection
was to the wording of the hydraulic bill,
which left the expenditure of the State
money to the commissioner. The matter
of salary was left to the Legislature.
S. J. Hendy asked for information as to
what had been done regarding the State
Mining Bureau. Chairman Neff replied
that he had beard some talk of changes
in the bureau, but so far as he could see |
there was no fear of the institution at j
present. Hendy moved that a committee
of three be appointed by the chair to con- i
sider the question, and his motion pre- !
vailed. S. J. Her.dy. M. B. Kerr and
Samuel K. Thornton were appointed.

CYCLE CHAMPIONS
MIKE NEW RECORDS
Loughead and Ziegler's
Fast Rides at the
League Meet.
Mott and Kenna Shewed Re
markable Form in the
Amateur Events.
A Day Replete With Surprises, Upsets
and Broken Records â Rms' Re
versal of Form.
The benefit meet of the North Califor
nia Division, League of American Wheel
men, at the Velodrome yesterday after
noon, brought out the largest crowd and
furnished the best sport ever seen at a
cycle meet here.
The threatening weather did not keep
lovers of ibe Eport away, and although
the men rode for blue ribbons the contests
were as hot as if they had been fighting
for gold and precious stones.
One of the prettiest features of the meet
was the one-third mile exhibition by Fred
J. Loughead, the Canadian champion,
paced by Dow, Becker and Boyden on a
triplet. Announcer Hynes said Loughead
was out of form, but one would never
have guessed it by the ride he put up.
He made the sixth in 18 1-5 and the third
in 34 4-5 seconds, record time. One can
easily understand, after seeing his ride,
how well he deserves his title of cham
pion. He will rank very high among the
professionals here on the coast.
Ckto Ziepler, Ihe California champion,
lowered tne coast record in a hali-mile ex
hibition, triple paced. He made it in
53 1-5 seconds, the former record beincr Â£6.
Ziescler showed splendid form and with a
little more conditioning will b^ a promi
nent facior at the Velodrome meets. He
?s very popular wiih California audiences
and received an ovation on .his appear
ance.
There were some pretty finishes in the
heat- oi the thir.i ol a mile scratch, pro
fessional. The first went to George Bovee
of Texas, who beat Hardy Downing of San
Jose and others in a hot surint.
Charley Wells was shut out in the sec
ond. "Bjb" Terrilt and Allan Jones both
beating him. It was a close finish be
tween these two and Terrill won by
inches.
Harry Terrill won the third heat in
easy style, Slater of Arizona second.
The final was v ry exciting. Slater fell
at the start and was out of it. Downing
had the pole all the way, with Jones and
Harry Terrill trying to get it away from
him. Jones took a chance on the final
turn, and got the inside, while "'Bob '
Terrill rode high up the bank and camo
down with a terrible rush. A blanket
would have covered these lour at the tape.
wi:h Jones slightly in the lead. Down
ing was second and Terrill third. The
time was :40 4-5.
The two-thirds mile handicap, profes
tional, was run in one heat, "Bob" Ter
rill, Wells, Freeman and Byrne compet
ing. In a pretty finish Freeman won,
Wells second, Terrill third. Time, 1:25.
Percy Moit rode a half-mile exhibition,
paced by an amateur triplet team, in 54
seconds flat, making a new coast racord.
The Velodrome fhielu race was the
opening event of the long programme. It
was at one mile, unpaced, the riders
starting at opposite sidesof thetrack. The
contestants were C. E. Dow of Seattle,
who has held the shield since New Year's
day, and D. E. Whitman of Los Angeles,
who challenged him. The latter secured a
good lead from the start, and won in
2:18 1-5.
Tiie one-third mile handicap, amateur,
was run 111 six heats. Elford took the
first in : 47 3-5. George Fuller put up a
creat ride in the second heat, beating a
field of six in the fast time of : 43 1-5.
Carmen and Raynaud fell In this heat, but
were only slightly bruised. The third
wen Ito Tony Alborelle in :46. Mott won
the fourth after a hard fight, in : 50 3-5.
Ross, the popular Olympian, walked away
from his field in the fifth, winning as he
pleased in :47 1-5. Kenna's win of the
sixth heat was also easy, time :45 2-5.
This brought the six fastest amateurs of
the coast into the final, and it was a fisht
from the crack of the pistol. The crowd
went wild over the finish. With Kenna
iand Russ fighting it out in front together,
Mott came on the inside and got the pole
and Russ was beaten. It was so close
between Mott and Kenna when they
crossed the tape, the judges called it a
dead heat. The auuience was about
equally divided, half yelling for Mott and
the otner half for Kenna. Their time was
43 seconds fiat, American record. Russ
took third.
There were four beat 3to the one-half
mile handicap, amateur, the winners to
qualify for the final. Kenna won the first
easily, and it was thou ht Russ would
have a similarly easy victory in the sec-'
ond, but he finished last, to the disap
pointment of hia friends, Gooch of the Re
lianca Club being the winner. Coulter of
the California won the third in a close
finish.
Squires and Daacon fell in the next heat,
but, were unhurt. George Fuller won,
Williams second.

itself. It has paid for the regalia and supplies
furnished by the grand parlor and has "a nest
egg" in the shape oi .f 100 in the treasury.

The City Sues for 38 t'entg and Gets
the Wrong Man.
Sometimes the litiga'.ion in whicn the
City end county is concerned takes an
amusing phase. This was the case in the
suit against John Hass, against whom
suit was brought for personal property
taxes. The amount for which Hass was
supposed to be delinquent and fjr which
the ponaerous. machinery of the law was
put in motion as a collection agency was
38 cents. Hass paid no attention to the
suit until some expenses hrd accrued,
making up the amount due 93 cents.
Then he sent in a communication that
the property in question on winch the tax
had been assessed belongs to John
Schmerker.
FIGHTING FOR
SIX NEW JUDGES
The Bill to Increase the
Local Judiciary Is Now
Ready.
Facts and Figures Have Been
Gathered to Support the
Claims.
More Than 20,000 Cases Said to Be
Pending in tbe Superior
C urts-
Everything is now in readiness for the
fight in behalf o! the bill providing for an
increased judiciary in Ban Francisco.
Facts and figures have been prepared with
considerable care and attention to details,
a short but appropriate act has been
drafted and it will be presented to the
Legislature this week by San Francisco
men.
The bill will be backed up with a large
volume of evidence calculated to show
that the present number of Superior
Judges in this City is altogether inade
quate to the pressing requirements of the
times and that an increase of six Judges,
making the Superior Court have eighteen
departments, is absolutely needed now.
In support of thesa claims it will be
demonstrated that the legal business oi
San .Francisco has moro than kept pace
with the increase in population; and as
the City has nearly doubled itself in the
number of its inhabitants since the Supe
rior Courts were instituted in 1879, just
eighteen years ago, legal practice hero has
so iar grown in bulk as to hopelessly clog
the courts. Besides the argument and
evidence in favor of the proposed bill, it
is said that there will be powerful backing
from several of the leading lawyers of San
Francisco.
E. P. Cole will go to Sacramento either
Monday or Tuesday with the bill, accom
panied, no doubt, by many prominent at
torneys interested in the measure. He
has been ac*.:ve in the interest of the bill
and has received the assistance of other
lawyers.
"People would be surprised," said be
yesterday, '"if tdey were told that nearly
25,000 cases are pending on the calendars of
the Superior Courts of this City and
County. And yet such is the case, strange
as it nitty seem. Justice is blocked in its
progress. Often we have to wait for
i months to get a hearing, and cases are
â  known to have been on the calendar over
! a year from the date they were at issue.
j What excuse can be made for this condi
-1 tion of things? It is a fact, not a theory,
that confronts us. Nobody can say that
the Superior Judges do not work faith
fully; they work arduously â the hardest,
in fact, of any men in the City Hall. Why,
the way things are nowadays in the Su
perior Court it is a screaming farce. Sev
eral attorneys will agree with me that an
increase in the number of courts is neces
sary."
Mr. Cole will bring to Sacramento a table
of figures that are intended to astonish the
Senators and Assemblymen as to the state
of affairs in the local Superior Courts.

in 1879 nearly 85,000 cases were commenced
in them. Each succeeding year saw the
number increase. The number of cases
filed in the first nine years after 1579 was
Â°4 000- in the last nine years it was 34,000,
an increase of approximately 10 000 cases ;
yet when the court was established in 18/9
the new constitution deemed twelve Judges
necessary to carry on the work in ban
Francisco. , ...
The fact is proved that the legal busi
ness has increased 1.50 per centum in the
last eighteen year?. On the organization
of the court in 1879, nine Judges were as
signed to civil cases. Since then tnree
departments have been regularly assicned
to criminal cases, aim two to probate,
leaving sev^n Judge" for civil business.
The civil cases commenced in the nscÃl

The figures for 1896 do not include ap
peals from the Police Court, which were
not recorded. Mr. Cole believes that a
single glance r.t these figures will con
vince the legislators of the merit of his
fight. The statistics were compiled in the
County Clerk's office and are official.
Yesterday they were scrutinized and care
fully copied for ttie documents to be dis
tributed at the capital.
Deputy County Clerk Piper estimated
that about 20.000 cases are pending on the
calendars of the Superior Courts. This
information is to be used by the men be
hind the bill and be presented with all
the other facts and figures. So it is likely
that a lively wee/c is in store for the law
makers at Sacramento.

WON A GREAT
LAW CASE
Arrival of John Campbell,
Counsel for Exiled
Hawaiians.
No Case Like It for Almost 800
Years and Judgment Was
Obtained.
But a Hearing Went From Vanouvsr
to England and Backâ Fato
of the Warimoo.
John Campbell, a prominent attorney
of Vancouver, B. C, is among tna
arrivals at the Baldwin. Mr. Camp
bell is of the linn of Wilson &
Campbell, who have just won a legal vic
tory that is being talked about all over the
world. It involved the case of the Ha
waiian exiles, James Cranstoun, Mueller
and J. Johnstone, the latter of San Fran
cisco, who two years ago were deported
from Honolulu on tlie British steamship
Warimoo.
The throe men alluded to were royalists
and were active participants in the revo
lution at the time aforesaid. Ttie repra
senlatives of the Dole Government ar
rested them and forcibly expelled them,
placing them aboard the British ship for
transportation to Vancouver.
Mr. Campbell and his partner, to whom
these cases were taken by the exiles, main
tained that the owners of the Werimoo
were liable for damages on the ground
that they had imprisoned and carried away
these men against their will. Principles
were involved in the case that have been
called up but two or three times in 800
years.
"We maintain," said Mr, Campbell last
night, "that the owners of the Warimoo
had no right to bear a part in carrying
away these men, because when the ship
had got three miles off abore the limit of
the Hawaiian territory was reached and
the Warimoo was under British law. In
taking these men they really made of the
Warimoo a prison. The men could not
jump overboard. They must preserve
their lives. So they were forcibly carried
to another country.
"Suit was therefore brought against the
Warimoo for $50,000 damages in each
case. We lirst brought the suu before a
single Judge and he nonsuited us on the
ground tbut there was no caus? of action.
Then we appealed to the bench of full
Judges of ths province of British Colum
bia. They decided there was a cau-e of
action and from that an appeal was taken
to the Privy Council of England, where
eminent English lawyers advised tbat the
decisions of the courts in British Colum
bia were correct. A new trial was then
had and the jury found a verdict in favor
of James Cranstoun, whose case was the
hrsi to be heard. The other two cases be
ing exactly similar were dependent upon
this case and the end with them will
necessarily be the same.
"From the fact that there have only
been two or three similar causes of action
in about 800 years, the trial of those ca^es
has been looked upon with unusual in
terest. They are destined to h^ure in Uie
annals oi the law to the remotest time."NO DEFICIENCY
SAYS MR. HAWLEY
He Comes to the Defense of
the Old Board of
Education.
But Present Directors Insist That
School Finances Are in
Bad Shape.
Alarm Spreading Through the Depart
ment, ani a Teachers' Petition Is
in Circulation-
While the present Board of Education
is figuring out some way to cope with an
apparently large deficit in the school
fund, Charles 11. Hawley, chairman of
the Finance Committee of the old Board of
E lucation, makes the assertion with, some
emphasis, that "the so-called deficit exists
on. yon paper." Mr. Hawley visited the
offices of the Board of Education yester
day and completed a statement which he
has prepared, to show just what condition
the finances o! the old board were at the
opjn ing of the present year.
4 V rector Waller of the present Board of
â j Ltion takes decided objection to the
iiaiement that the dericit is nothing but
seeping. He also called attention to
what is claimed to be the fact that at the
Jp.st meeting of the old board Mr. Hawley
read a .report in which lie said that the
only mistake made by the board was, in
bis judgment, teat "in figurine of the
fiscal year, -after carrying over a surplus
of $40,000 from the last fiÂ«cal year, and be
fero we knew what our appropriation wss
to be for the present fiscal year, we entered
into a contract for over $50,000 worth of
work, expecting to get an appropriation
from the Supervisors, which did not ma
terialize."
The expert of the present board has
figured out that there is now an actual de
ficit and that this amounted to $41,308 50
at the time of the close of office of the old
board. "Starting with a surplus," says
the expert, "there will be a deficit of not
less than $100,000."
These contradictory views, which affirm
and deny the good management of the
old board, naturally have evoked much
heat. During the past few days, in lact
ever since tne Board of Education met,
the hum of calculation has sounded
through the new City Hall like a buzzing
of bees, growing louder and louder and
angrier. The announcement that the
schools may be closed for one month has
caused no end of discussion. Clearly the
old and new boards are at loggerheads on
facts which will undoubtedly be investi
gated further, now that a challenge has
been thrown out by Mr. Hawley in behalf
of the old board.
The meeting next Wednesday night
ought to be very interesting.
Charles H. Hawley, chairman of the
Finance Committee of the last Board of
Education, has prepared the following
statement of the condition of the school
fund on January 4, 1897:

committee of the present board, have
been misleading the general public as well
as the teachers of the department on the
condition of the school fund, which re
ports have not been very glowing. The
so-called deficit exists only on paper. If
there is a deficit, which no one can tell at
present, and will not be known until af'.er
the fiscal year has closed, it will not be
the fault of the last board, but of tne Au
ditor and the last Board of Supervisors.
As far as the closing of the schools is con
cerned, it is not necessary. The present
board at the end of the fiscal year can
withhold the teacher's salaries for the
month of June until the second install
ment is received from the State fund,
which will be about July 5 to 8, at which
time the school fund can be closed up for
the year.
"The receipts for the last half of the
fiscal year will not be nearly as large as
the first half, but with a little economy
and not so much paper talk I believe,
without a doubt, there will be no defi
ciency of $90,000 or staring the
Board of Education in the face."
A petition emanating from the Girls'
High School 19 being circulated for sig
natures to the effect that the petitioners
pray the Board of Education to keep
the schools open witu the promise to pay
as soon as :he money is in sight.
School Director Heed, in an interview,
said: "I believe the board has no right
to take away any portion or the whole of
the school teacLers' salaries. They do their
work and they are legally entitled to be
paid for it. It is illegal to deprive them
of it. No one teacher wants to raise
any legal opposition to such action, but if
all the teachers were in accord and took a
united stand against it, it would do some
good. The only way to meet the deficiency
is either to close the schools, for a month
or to make an agreement with the teachers
of the City as a whole by which they would
teach that month without pay, waiving
their rights to salary for that month, and
agreeing to receive it at the beginning of
the fiscal year from an appropriation
especially set aside for that purpose."
A suggestion lias been made by a teacher
thai an open meeting of tne teachers may
be called that they may express their
views.

Mr. Spear Was an Original KcKinley
Man and Voted for Him at the
M;nn?apolis Convention.
Joseph S. Spear, the well-known Repub
lican, leit lor the East last night, accom
panied by Mrs. Spear.
Mr. Spear is one of President-elect Mc-
Kinley's personal friends, and the coming
inaugural is or much interest owing to the
more than usually close relations that
have been sustained between them. Mr.
Spear visited McKinley last summer and
remained some time with him as his
guest at Canton, and as one of the electors
from this State voted lor him at the Min
neapolis convention. It was to Mr.
Spear's effort-* on his return to this State
that the Mclvinley sentiment which per
vaded the voting population wa% largely
due. He was loyal to Ir.s friend and in
s-pired every one with whom he came in
contact with a confidence in the soldier
camlidate from Oiiio.
Air. Spear's plans include a visit to
Mark Hanna at Cleveland and a sojourn
at Washington, D. C, during the inaugu
ral ceremonies.
BUENS WELL EEMEMBEEED.
St. Andrew* Society Will Appropriately
Celebrate His Birthday.
The St. Andrew's Society will celebrate
the one hundred and thirty-eighth anni
versary of the birih of Robert Burns on
Friday evening, January 29, at Scottish
Hall, 105 Larkin street.
The celebration will consist of a short
address, followed by sones and music
from the poet's works and the recitation
of ''Tarn o' Shanter." Ste.-eopticon views
of many places and incidents in the poet's
stormy career, from the thatched cottage
where be was born to the costly mauso
leum erected above the mortal remains,
will be thrown upon the screen. Alter lv
o'clock the lads and lussies will have an
opportunity to "'trip the light fantastic"
to good Scottish music.
The St. Andrew's Society was organized
in September, 1863. Its prime object was
to aid the unfortunate of their -country
men. During the past year alone over 5'X)
needy ones have been kindly assisted by
it 3 practical and tangible philanthropy.
The sick are cared for, friends are com
municated with and when "Death, the
poor man's dearest friend," conies to the
stricken one his remains are reverently
and decently interred.
In addition to the society's work of
helpful beneficence it seeks to advance by
all legitimate means the social improve
ment of its members, encouraging and
stimulating the development of physical
enerey and especially the elevation of
moral character.
The society numbers among its mem
bers some of the foremost men of the City
and it ext nds a cordial invitation to all
"Brither Scots" to familiarize themselves
with its objects and methods. All Scotch
men and sons of Scotchmen are eligible to
membership.
ONLY A LOVELY DEEAM.
The New City Jiail Will >ot Have a
Marble Wairmci.t Yet.
When the City Hall Commissioners
came together yesterday City Attorney
Creswell made a suggestion for the beau
tilieation of the corridors. There is no
money to carry out the wort and he ad
mitted, therefore, that for the present
there will be no such adornment as he had
in mind. He believes that the corridors
could be wainscoted with marble to the
height of fifteen feet and tho walls above
the wainscoting painted in oil, for a cost
of $75,000. Tne length of the corridors is
nearly one and a half miles. The other
Commissioners, Mayor Phflan and
Auditor liroderick, agreed that this would
improve the .ball. The architect was in
structed to prepare a more ornamental
structure for a newsstand than the one
now existing as a news-stand on the
ground floor.
FRIEDLANDER'S ESCAPE.
He Waa Struck by a Bullet, but Not
Wounded.
T. Cary Friedlander, secretary of the
Produce Exchange Call Board, had a nar
row escape on Thursday. He was cross
ing Montgomery street, near the Mills
building, when a bullet struck him in the
back.
it was discovered that a 36 -caliber
cartridge had been placed on the car track
by some "joker," and had been exploded
by a south-bound Montgomery-street car.
The cartridge was loaded, and the bullet
had found its mark in Mr. Friedlander.
Investigation revealed that the bullet,
while sufficiently strongly impelled to
iieal Mr. Friedlander a sharp blow, had
not onrush force to penetrate his clothes.
Yesterday Mr. Friediander's friends were
congratulating him on his escape.
Gardner's Appointment Confirmed.
The appointment of Rev. John Gardner as
Chinese Interpreter for the Customs service
has been confirmed at Washington, D. C. Mr.
Gardner is probably the best Chinese scholar
in the United States. - He has had Ion? ex
perience as an interpreter. He was publicly

Judge Ogden Hoffman and also by the Chief
Justice of British Columbia. He reads and
writes Chinese waft perfect fluency. .

Will E Fisher's Assets
Give Creditors Small
Consolation.
His Wife, Who h a Loser,
Firmly Declines to Furnish
Assistance.
Charles S Neal Appointed at a Meet
ing cf Cnditors to Prosecute
Their Claim?.
Will E. Fisher's creditors held a meet
ing at the office of his attorneys, Whit
worth & Shurtliff, yesterday forenoon to
discuss the situation. Nothing of a very
cue rful nature was elicited in the discus
sion. Most of the time was spent in con
sidering the liabilities, as the apparent
assets seemed hardly worth mentioning.
There were about thirty creditors in at
tendance, and according to the estimate
of Miss Dorau, Fisner's cashier, there were
liabilities amounting to about $35,000 rep
resented. Of this amount, Mrs. Fisher,
wife of ihe#ebior, is out $21,009- The
esta'e of James G. Fair esif mates its loss
at about $6000, the Wallace estate ciaims
$1500, and the remainder of the liabilities
consists mainly of rents collected for
divers landlords and not accounted for.
The assets are rather an uncertain quan
tity. M:ss Doran valued them at about
$4000, though from their nature it is hard
to tut a definite value upon them. They
consist largely of office fixtures, block
books and other appurtenances tbe real
estate business. Charles A. Shurtiiff, one
ot Fisher's attorney*, stated that Fisher
was in the habit of estimating his assets
ataDOUt $8000, but Mr. Shnrtliff did not
think they would bring $4500. Besides
the liabilities reported Fisher is said to
have some other debts, which are not sup
posed to be large.
His employes are safe, as their claims,
wtrcli are preferred, amount to less than
$100. With all hts delinquencies, he is
t^aid to have always managed to be quite
prompt in his payments to his employes.
Trie meeting of creditors yesterday was
called by Whitwortii it Shurtiiff, as a re
sult oi a letter which they received from
Fisher a. few day- ago. This letter, which
was mailed in this City, requested them
to settle up his ul'fuirs as best they could,
aud stated they would hear from him
again. This firm represented Fisher in
tne suit which was brought against him
by the Fair estate, Dut the attorneys say
they have not seen their client for two
weeks.
At yesterday's meeting a determination
was expressed by all .present not to allow
Fisher to go into insolvency. William H.
Jordan, representing Mrs. Casey, sug
gested that all claims be assigned to one
t'erson, and he could then attach all
Fisher's property, sell it, and after de
uuctiug costs divide the proceeds pro rata
among the creditors. .This suggestion
met with popular favor, and Cuarles S.
Neal, representing the Fair estate, was
appointed assignee of the claims. A
committee consisting of Charles S. Neal,
C. M. Jennings (Fisher's stepson) and E.
P. Blake was appointed to secure the
assignment of creditors.
Mr. Jennings was asked if Mrs. Fisher
was inclined to aid ihe creditors and he
gave a decided negative, stating that she
was already a suffic.ently heavy Josar.
He also stated she wuiild put in her ciaitn
for a pro rata of the proceeds.
There was some talk among the smaller
creditors yesterday of proceeding crimi
nally against. Fiaher, but the larger losers
are too uiucli intent on figuring out how
they are to lessen tfteir looses to thins
much of any criminal action.
Although Fisher's embarrassment was
known to h.s friends ami many of his
business associates, they claim to be
ignorant of ihe cause, as his business
was apparently extensive and lucrative.
Fisher, however, ciaimed tnat his con
tract with Fair for the sale of the Holly
Pa.k lots was unprofitable, and that alter
the expiration of ins contract Fair often
promised to reimburse him. This state
ment he makes in a counter claim to the
Fair suit.
The statement in a morning paper that
Joim McDjniiell, an employe of Fisher,
had aKu cone away, is incorrect. .Mc-
Donnell was in town ye^terda}'.

A CLOTHING SALE
2011) CENTURY!
A sale never before attempted by any Wholesale Clothing Manufacturer
in the United States. . . â ?â¢'.
- For thirty years it has been our custom, at the end of the season, to sell
i our travelers' samples to the trade at less than the wholesale manufacturing
cost. This year, for the first time in the history of the clothing trade, the
â  public will have a chance to buy these samples at the same prices we would
sell them to the trade.
Our travelers have returned from their season's'work, and now we placa
on sale their entire line of samples at about one-third actual value. We
really lose nothing by this â have already done their duty and we would
have to sell them at these prices to the trade anyway.
The stock of samples is not large, so you must come quickly to get your
pick.

ANOTHER STAKE
FOR SCARF PIN
Took the Alameda Handicap
in a Drive From
Caspar.
Yankee Doodle Outgamed and
Outfinished Proud Mt.
McGregor IL
c ugar Foot, an OJds-On Cbo cc, Beaten
by N c Nacâ Fi Fi Scores Again
ia a Hurdie Event
From the size of the assembled crowd j
that viewed the racfng at Emeryville yes
terday it was suspected by the close
guessers that there were just a few ab
sentees from the usual Saturday clique of
race patrons. This fact can be easily ac
counted for. Many dizzy, warm equine
idols have been smashed to atoms duting
the two weeks of sport just ended yester- <
day, and troublous times have been ex- j
perienced by form players. In disgust at
what tftey termed ill luck many have re
frained from taking the trip across the
bay, awaiting the reopening of Ingleside
track, hoping to regain favor witb h'ckie
Dame Fortune.
Tne day was cloudy and cool, but the j
track was fatt and most of ihe events J
were taken in fast time. Favorites again j
met witb poor Bucces-, but two of the
lavored ones in the betting managing to
head their fields out Nearly Â»U the
members of the ring fraternity quit good
winners of the day's bookine.
The Alameda linndicap for all ag*s,
over a mile, worth $700 to the first hors*.
was the feature of the card. The Burns & j
Waterh'ou^e stable scratched Mt. Me- [
Grejjor II and let Caspar, with 98 pounds |
ii d, try for the prize. Starting at 8 and I
10 to 1 in the betting he made the run
liing and was only nipped out the la3t |
few strides by E'i Purser's pood rilly Scarf
Pin, the 2 to 1 favorite, which reeled off
the distance in l'Al%. St. Lea with top
weight up was a good third.
The result of the third race at seven and
a half furlongs was the surr>riseof theaay.
Drawn from the stake event especially to
prune his company in this affair, Mt. Mc-
Gregor 11, witu IC9 pounds up, was con
sidered ihe "pipe" of the aft-rnoon's pro
cepdings. Backed from 1 to 2 down to 2
to 5, he encaged in a battle royal from
start to finish with Yankee Doodle and,
outfooted the iatter part of the journey,
was compelled to acknowledge deieat by a i
scant head. Show hon ra west to David,
a 50 to 1 shot.
Another one of the cinchy sort was laid
to rest in the opening high-weight handi
cap, over a distance of six furlongs.
Barney Schreiber's Suear Foo\ with 101
pounds in the saddle, was supposed to be
invincible, but quit badly in the stretch,
and Nio Nac, against which 10 to 1 was at
one time laid, beat the 3 to 1 chance out a
head in 1:15 Hat. Nebula, ridden by J.
Ward, was the recipient of the short end
of the purse.
Green Morris dropped Lobengnla in the
miie and a furlong selling run, and the
brown horse ditt not have much to beat-
He went to the post at odds of 2 to 5 and
won without difficulty from St. Aignon, a
20 tol outsider. Scimitar, heavily backed
to get the place, was third.
Lefeat awaited anoiher favorite in the'
fifth evsnt, a six furlong spin, with a field j
of eight starting. Sent to the post at odds j

HOME FOR WAIFS
Private Charity Forced to
Do What the City
Neglects.
Chief Lloyd's Best Efforts Have
Not Met With the Success
They Deserve.
Secretary Prescott of tbe Chi
Society States the Needs
Immediate Action.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,[
y<DS Broadway, Jan. 23- Â»
A movement was started to-day to es
tablish a home in connection witu the Po
lice Department, in which young children
who are found on the street or who are
arrested on various pretests can be con
lined without being placed in a cell or
brought in contact with older prisoners.
Some months ago Chief of Police Lloyd
placed this matter before the Christian
Endeavor Society irf a very plain-spoken
letter. The matter was takuu np, dis
cussed, met with some disfavor and for a
: >ng time has not been heard of. The
Kndeavur Society stated that it was out
<iJe of the line of work for which they
were organized. But ths- matter is now
being taken in hand by prominent En- â 
deavorsrs, independently of their organi
zation.
A statement is being circulated asking
for pledges for the support of the home.
So much has been published recently of
the necessity for such a place and of the
inability of the Police Department to ren
der any relief with the facilities at their
command, that it is felt that no argument
is necessary in order to convince the pub
lic that the welfare of little waifs depen is
upon toe immediate establishment of such
au institution. When it is known how
much support can be depended upon, then
a meeting will be held and ollicers ap
pointed to prosecute the worK.
Mrs. Prescott, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
said to-day that it is not the duly of char
itable individuals or organizations to pro
vide such a home, but tie responsibility
rests with the city. -'Chief Lloyd and 1,"
she said, "have had many conversations
on this subject, and wa have often felt
grieved at the manner in wliich our hands
are tied. It is an absolute necessity in a
city ot this sizÂ» to have an- apartment
where chi.dren can be kept after being ar
rested or while awaiting being sent to
some institution, so that they need not
come in contact with criminals.
'â¢Tne expense would be very light, and
it should be placed in charge ol a sensible
woman. Her services would not be per
manently re quired, and with the present
tel phone system of the Police Depart
ment she could easily be called to the
prison whenever her presence was needed.
"Twenty - five dollars a month would
amply pay for any such services, and
there arc many sensible, deserving women
that would be triad of such a position. It
is the duty, of re city to provide such
quarters as these ca-es demand. Within
tlie past six months little boys have been
put in cells, young lads' have met with
older criminals, girls have shared the
quarters of Labitum drunkards and di'-so
iute women, and all this cannot possibly
be avoided with the present condition of
the City Prison. Chief L.oyd lias done a
fireatdeal toward making the prison what
he desires it shouid be, but he cannot
i reate some thins: out of nothing, and it is
higli time that the city government awoke
to a responsibility of its duties."

Amid the screeching of geese, the cack
ling of numerous hens and the crowing of
proud roosters, with the cooing of pigeons
Rev. James Small, Who Made an
Address at the Chicken Show.
and the whistling of chicks fresh from the
incubator for an accompaniment. Profes
sor Hilgard delivered a speech tG-night in
the Exposition building that formally
opened the annual poultry and pigeon
show.
The professor referred to the valuÂ» of
the industry to this State and to the
necessity of paying attention to the
details, which alone can insure the breed
ing of valuable and paying stock. He
spoke briefly of the value of such exhibi
tions, and said that no one could pass
around without admiring the natural
beauty of the exhibits and learnine a val
uable lesson.
Hugh Craig, president of the San Fran-'
Cisco Chamber of Commerce, delivered a
short address and then the Rev. James
Small of the First Christian Church re
viewed the show briefly as a great object
lesson and teacher of the value of kindness
to animals.
Mr. Small had /nnch to contend with,
for as he pleaded on behalf of the feathered
tribes those whom he would benefit were
so heartily in accord with his sentiments
that they could not refrain from noisily
voicing their approval. The uudienre,
however, were rather amused than an
noyed by ihe interruptions, which added,
if not to the comforr, certainly to the hu
mor ot the situation.
Several welJ-known members of the
Acnie Club, including Messrs. Stegmnn,
Toonig, McNally, McDonald and Wil
liams, gave an interesting exhibition "and
a few ottier musical numbers were also on
the progiamme.
Superintendent Craigie Sharp stated
that it was not the desire oi the manage
ment to make a fortune out of the show,
but all tney wanted was to balance tneir
accounts and they would be satisfied. The
desire of the association is to promote and
encourage line breeding, and not to make
money.

No Wheels on Sidewalks.
OAKLAND, Cal., - Jan. 23.â Mayor
Davie. who is himself an ardent cyclist,
does not believe that the sidewalks should :
De used by wheelmen. In a veto message
to-day regarding an ordinauce which
grants cychsts'Mbe right of way at all
hours of day or night the Mayor said:
"The streets 01 our city are in good condi
tion for riding every day of the year. Tjle
proper place for bicycle-riding is in the
street, where the chances for accidents
are very remote. , Furthermore the courts
have bed that a bicycle is a vehicle, en
titled to the rights and privileges of a
vehicle. Consequently a rider of wheel
has no more rigiit on a sidewalk than a
wagon."

CHINESE LAUNDRIES FILTHY.
Dr. Hart Recommends to the Board of
Health to Kaid Them.
Dr. Hart of the Board of Health is of
the opinion that ttie spraying of clothes
by means of the mouth, in Chinese laun
dries, is calculated to communicate germs
of disease to persons wearing the gar
ments coming from such places. He also
says that he has discovered that a large
number of places which are nun ostensi
bly as laundries are nothinu mare nor less
less than opium dens, which ;*re much
frequented by white persons. He also
recommends to tiie board to raid the
laundne--. "A filtny habit in many of
these Chinese laundries," he reports, "is
their sleeping on the washed cloihing of
their patrons. The following day these
same clothes, without undergoing a second
washing, are ironed and returned to their
customers. This I witnessed myself."

THE CRAVEN PEOPLE SPRING
A MINE ON CAPTAIN LEES
Telltale Evidence in Quantity in Favor of Cooney
Found in General Dickinson's
Office.
FAIR PEOPLE ATTEMPT
TO HEAD IT OFF.
A Batch of uTo Me" Notaria'
Blanks Printed Previous
lo 1891.
THE WORK WAS PRINTED BY
CROCKER & CO.
The Bonanza Interests Un arth An
other *' Bogie Man" in the Sh p^
cf a Missing Deed.
Both sides in the Fair case uncovered a
surprise yesterday for their opponents.
The Craven people hauled from out the
archives and records of Attorney John H.
Dickinson's office a number of notarial
records, identical in wording and form
with Coon y's certificate in the pencil
deeds, which they have ovidence were
printed at least five years ago. The Fair
people made the discovery that a deed ac
knowledged by Cooney with one of His
printed regular ottice blanks after the date
of the pencil will was missing.
The unearthing of the notarial certifi
cate!* in General Dickinson's office came
as a sort of boomerang to those who are
prosecuting Cooney. The Fair people and
Captain Lees have sought to establish
from the beginning that previous to Au
gust 1(3, IS:*5, no blank certificates of ac
knowledgment primed by H. S. Crocker
& Co. contained the words "to roe." In
the chain of evidence they have sought to
wind about the young notary the two
chief links were the defective printing in
the acknowledgment? on tbe pencil deeds
and the time Crocker A Co. lirst began to
j.rnit this form oi acknowledgment.
There are in t-.e pencil deeds acknowl
edgment evidences of bai printing in
many of the lines. These defects are visi
ble to the naked eye on close inspection,
and under the microscope become matters
of some importance. When Captain Lees
suddenly took a notion to take a hand in
the litigation he claimed to have discov
ered that in January, 1596, Crocker &. Co.
had printed a batch of 10,000 notarial
blanks, one-half of which had defects in
printing identical with those in the pencil
deeds acknowledgments. To strengthen
his case he sought 10 prove that none of
the blanks primed by Crocker contained
the words "to me" in previous to August,
Simon H. Wade, the foreman of the I
C:ocker printing department, swore on
the ,-tanri on Thursday last that previous
to 1895 Ui< iirni had printed none of this
k.nd of blanks. Young Whiteside, who
was discovered by tnp detectives at the
eleventh i<our, swore that he had inserted
the two little words, which promise to cut
much figure in Cooney's case, in the proof
that he sent up 10 the printers for a batch
(f 5000 blanks on August 16. 1595. For
some time past the Craven peo i ie have
had in their possession proofs of ah the
notarial blanks printed in this City for the
past ten years.
Incidentally they kept tab on Crocker's
establishment, and when Lees showed his
hand in Magistrate Cooks court tney hail
already up their sleeve the proof that
would disable one of the detective's big
gest weapons From 1873 to 1891 every
notarial certificate printed in this State
contained the words "to me" as a portion
of its contents. T.iefoim was prescribed
by law. and if Crocker & Co. had been
printing forms without these words they
were printing illegal forms. General John
H. Dickinson has been the attorney lor the
printing-house for a number of years and
has dratted ail the copy for the various
leu'al forms.
The records of Dickinson's office prov 'd
that previous :o 18!Â»1 all notarial certifi
cates contained tue>e words. There were
proofs of the blanks in i is desk without
number and the Craven people quietly
gathered a few of tnese in and prepared
themselves for the thunder Lees had
promised. When it came they were not
ULjconcerted.
When Captain Lees discovered he had
been caught in a corner he made quick
tracks for Crocker's place and satisfied
himself he had left a hole unpegged. Yes
terday afternoon George Crocker
made a call at Dickinson's office
and attempted to get possession of ihe
telltale forms. Captain Wade, who is is
charge of the office during Dickinson's
attendance in the State Senate, refused to
give them up and a wrangle ensued.
"General Diclcinson i 3 our attorney,"
?aid Crocker, angrily, "and those blanks
belong to us by right."
"I can't help that," replied Wade.
"General Dickinson is in Sacramento
and I can't give you anything without his
permission."
"But tne blanks are ours."
Wade shook his head. Crocker then de
manded admittance to Dickinson's private
room, but Wade was obdurate.
"I demand admittance to that room,"
said Crocker.
"And you wont get it," said Wade, and
the junior member of the printing estab
lishment withdrew to confer with his father
and Captain Lee*. No attempt was made
to secure possession of the h.an&s. It is
probable that application will be made to
day to General D.ckinson to give up the
documents.
But their delivery to Crocker now would I
come too late to prevent their playing an
important part in Cooney's defense.
Uopies of the different iseues are now in j
the possession of the Craven attorneys.
They bear the dates of their issues, secured '
lrom the records of Dickinson's office.
These dates cover a period extending back
to 1880, and when introduced in court will
probably go a long way to tearing down
the case Lees would build up against
Cooney.
The Craven people have alÂ«o made an
other rather interesting discovery in refer
ence to this portion of the celebrated case.
The Fair attorneys and detectives say j
that Cooney cut off the margin of the
acknowledgments he lued on tne pencil
deed?, removing the printer's mark and
the red line on the margin. It is their
contention that in this process a strip of
paper fully half an inch wide was re
moved. The orm of blank printed by
Crocker in 188fi, to which class Lees says
the pencil i^eeds acknowledgments be- j
lone, corresponds now in s;ze with j
Cooney's clipped blanks. If the pencil
deed forms had not been trimmed, they
would li.nvt- been at least half an inch
wider than those printed by Crocker.
This, Mrs. Craven's representatives say,
will be introduced Â«i the proper time in
court to prove ihat Lees and the Fair chil
dren have been conuting without the cost.
The blanks used by Cooney are identical
with those printed by Crocner & Co. pre
vious to 1891, in every particular, *o far as
the practiced eye can discern. They are
similar to those used by almost every no
tary in the State for many years.
There are now in the possession of Mrs.
Craven's attorneys copies of acknowledg
ment made by severai notaries previous to
the time of Senator Fair's death. Tney
are all' similar to Cooney's forms on the
pencil deeds.
One in particular was made by C. L.
Calvin of Alameda in 189 L It bears the
date of January 28, 1891, and to dispel all
doubt as to where it was printed the firm
name of H. fc>. Crockor & Co. appears on
the margin.
The Craven people are confident that
they can bowl the case against Cooney out
of court without any effort. Assuming
that the prosecution rests Us ca^e entirely
on the defects in the Cooney acknowledg
ments, by which the prosecution will seek
to i -entity the date of their printing with
the issue by Crocker in January, 189(i,
tney have in lebuttal proofs of blanks
printed by the same firm previous to 1890
and conlaining.eimilar evidence of a bat
tered stereotype.
According to the story of Crocker's em
ployes the issue of 10,000 forms was
printed on two forms to s-ve time. Both
impress ons v.ere made from type. In
one the type was battered, according to
the police witnes-es, but the Craven
people are asking why if there was such
naste in the mutter a stereotype was not
made and thus the correct forms would
have been assured.
The presence of Captain Lees in tbe
â  case i as led many to inquire why if he
| believes Cooney is in the conspiracy he
does not arrest Mrs. Craven and others
connected with the pencil deeds.
This matter will probably furnish some
interesting testimony when Cooney's
! lawyers begin his defense.
The deed that the Fair people say has
i disappeared is dated in November. 1894,
| two months later than the pencil deeds.
It was acknowledged by Cooney on a form
i having his name printed upon it. Its
bearing on the case is indirect. The heirs
bave been looking over Cooney's records,
and they say that as far as they can dis
cover Cooney used forms with li is name
printed on iv almost every instance. They
argue from this that i: is peculiar that in
Mrs. Craven's case a blank form could be
uÂ«ed. The presence of Cooney's office
certificate on a deed made later than the
Craven documents would be evidence to
them that Cooney was not out of mater. al
with his name printed on it when it is
claimed Fair called at his office on Jan
uary 27. 1894.
The Fair people intimate that John G.
Banter, who has already been mentioned
in the case as a friend of Cooney's, kn<ws
something about the disappearance of the
document. Barker, who is a son-in-law of
Mrs. Johnson of the Colonial Hotel, has
an excellent reputation and the Craven
attorneys say the attempt of their
opponents to bring his name into the
ca-e is a sort of bogie man move in the ab
sence of some legitimate excuse to fight iv
the or>en.
The case against Cooney will be resumed
before Magistrate Carroll Cook to-morrow
morning.
AN EXPERT'S VIEWS.
G. L.. Bresie Talk* of the City's Kxpan
gion Northward â A. Magnificent
Park.
"The appraisement of the Fair estate
! will require careful study and special
! knowledge and skill," said G. L. Bresse of
the firm of L. G. Bresse & Co. to a Call
reporter yesterday at his office, 412 Pme
street. "There are two other appraisers,
i Ernest A. Leigh and R.chard V. Dey, men
j cf wide experience and the highest stand
j inc.
"The estate has largely improved its
I north end property, and I have great faith
jin the future of that section. The pro-
I jpcted boulevard through Lombard street
' to the Presidio, with its superb marine
| view, will make a magnificent park, while
the order and discipline enforced will ex-
I elude the objectionable element, making
it most desirable for residence purposes.
"We find," he continued, "that money
is freer and our firm has made recent sales
lor investors who take advantage of ihe
low figures to secure bargains. We have
added special lines to our business, which
now includes making loans on real estate
and securities, auctioneering, the handling
of large properties, honse-rentirtg and
collections for residents and non-residents,
as well as placing insurance, advi.'ing in
vestments and the exchange of City and
country property."
In answer to a query Mr. Bresfesaid:
I "Ye*, there is certainly a mining revival,
! in which we take a great interest, espe
cially in Amador, El Dorado and
Tuolumne counties. New processes make
j profitable the working of 2ow-grade ores
| and claims once abandoned."
Mr. Bresse has shown commendable
public spirit in his support of the work of
improvement ciub9, especially along lines
that may become bu-miess streets. Al
though never aspiring to public office he
takes a keen interest in municipal affairs.
He is a strong advocate ot reforms in City
government, and during the recent elec
tion his influence was felt on the a:de of
good government.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 1897.
SAD DEATH OF
JOSEPH A. WEAVER
He Expired in the Receiv
ing Hospital in This
City.
Of a Roving Disposition, He
Had Lately Been Dis
sipating.
His Family, Who Live in San Jjse,
Were Greatly Surprised to H^ar
He Was Dad.
A young man about 25 years of age,
well dressed and evidently weil educated
from the manner of his conversation,
walked into the Receiving Hospital be
tween 12 and 1 o'clock Friday afternoon
and told Dr. Bunneil that be was going
crazy.
"I have been on a drunk for some days,"
he said, "and am suffering terribly.
Couldn't you put me somewhere for a
time till I get better?"
In answer to the doctor's questions he
said his name was J. A. Weaver, and that
his parents were wealthy residents of San
Joae. The reason he had gone to the hos
pital was to get recovered from his s-pree,
as he did not wish his parents to know
what he had been doing.
As he appeared to be on the verge of
delirium tremens Dr. Bunneil prescribed
for him, and after searching him had him
placed in a padded cell. There was noth
ing in bis pockets to show whether he was
teliing the truth about his name and ad
dress, and his purse was empty.
About 8 o'clock yesterday morning Dr.
Bunneil saw him in his cell and he ap
peared to be much better. He suggested
to the doctor that he had better leave the
bj^epital, but as he had not fully recovered
the doctor induced him to stay" for a lew
hour longer.
Dr. Bunneil, about 12 o'clock, went to
see how the young man was feeling and
was surprised to find him breathing hard.
He felt his pulse, and almost while doing
to the young man breathed his last.
The body was removed to tne Morgue
and the autopsy will show the cause of
death.
A dispatch from San Jose last nigh
gave the following additional facts:
Josph Addison Weaver was the eldest
son 01 Colonel T. K. Weaver, the president
of the Board of Trade in San Jose and a
prominent orchardist. The young man
was roving in disposition and given to
drinking heavily, but as he was of a ro
bust constitution it was not feared that
one of his sprees would result la tally. His
relatives and friends bad strong hopes
that he would overcome his habits of dis
sipation, as he was quite young, and the |
sudden and sad outcome is a great shock.
The family came to San Jose from Mat
toon, 111., three years ago, and Colonel
Weaver purchased thirty aces of im
proved orchard on the McKee road, north
east of the c.ty limits. The young man
wÂ«s not content to live and work on the
home place. He began to rove around
and get into bad company and his parents
could not control him or cet him to stay
at home. He finally left about a week
ago, saying that he was going to San
Francisco to hunt work. He was a good
singer and an athlete and he made very
good company among his young men
acquaintances. He was 24 years of age, a
native of Illinois. His father and. Secre
tary J. P. Pay of the Board of Trade will
leave San Jose for San Francisco this
morning to take charge of the remains.
BOWEN SET PiiEE.
Federal Jury Decide* 1 hat He Killed
â¢Junes in Self-Uefer.se.
The jury in the murder case of Harry
Bowen in the United States District Court,
yesterday found the defendant not guilty
after deliberating but ten minutes.

Defendant's mother came froiu the East
to sit by him during the trial and the ver
dict affected her deeply. After it was ren

Wilson and wept copiously.
Tnomas M. Drollet, a spectator, ap
plauded the verdict of the jury and cried,
"Good," whereupon he was reprimanded
by Judge Morrow and sentenced to twenty
hours' imprisonment. The sentence was
afterward remitted, upon Drollet's expla
nation that he had never been in a court
before and did not know his conduct was
improper.
Bowen came into prominence as the

but they were unsuccessful.
HUNG UP BY A HOOK.
A Bootblack buffers a Peculiar and
distressing Accident.
Garibaldi Giovani is the "boots" of Nais
mith's barber-shop on Clay street. It is
Garibaldi's weekly duty to wash the
windows and put a plate-glass polish on
Uiem. Yesterday morning while at the
top of a ladder about fifteen feet from the
ground, the ladder slipped at the bottom,
and Giovani was plunged to the sidewalk.
He naturally threw out his arms to catch
hold on some support, and while falling,
one of his bands struck an upward curved
awning hook and he was impaled upon it.
The hock ontered the palm near the
thumb joint and the hand was torn com
p.ftely ooen, making a bad wound.
When he came in contact with the hook,
Giova'ii naturally clinched his hand to save
himself, not knowing the nature of
the obstruction. This made the
laceration much worse. He hung a tew
seconds on the hook, the cruel iron tear
ing its way slowly through the palm
toward the knuckles. Then he fell, almost
fainting, to the sidewalk. Friends sent
him to the Keceiving Hospital, where the
wound was dressed. It will be several
weeKs before Giovani can polish boots
again.
Chita Jackson Held.
Mrs. Emma Cleverly, better known as Chita

a Large Sum.
OltoÃurmeister, Executor of the Dead
Man's Will, Demands Restitu
tion of Property.
I
Otto Burmeisler, as executor of the will
of Henry Becker, deceased, has tiled a suit
against Mrs Eliza Waldeck. who is also
tr.own as Eliza Becker, for the recovery
oi $SCOO and a lot on Oak Grove avenue,
near Harrison street, 25x112 feet in size,
said to be worth $2000. I
According 10 the complaint^lrs. Becker
took advantage of her position as a nurse
to induce her patient first to marry her
and subsequently to convey to her all his
property, which is estimated to be worth
about $7000.
It is alleged that on or about October
28, 1896, Eliza Waldeck met Henry Becker
tor the first time; that before that they
were unacquainted and unknown to each
other; that on the day named she was em
ployed to act as his nurse; that owing to
his infirmities and weakness he was de
pendent on her from the moment of her
installment as his nurse to the day of his
death; that in consequence she had the
absolute control and mastery over him
from that time to his death.
It is further alleged that immediately
after besoming his nurse the defendant
formed the des : gn of securing to herself
all the property belonging to the dead
man, and or depriving his creditors and
his heirs of their rightful share of the
same.
An explanation is offered that with this
intent she informed him that she was un
married and that the persons named in
his will did not care for him, ana 10 pr<
ven.t them from disproving this statement
she excluded all Iriends and acquaint
ances from tiis presence, thus preventing
them from having any conversations with
him.
All of these representations, it is said by
the plaintiff, were false, and by reason of
these untru? statements she induoed him
to marry _her on the 31st of October, three
days afte?she was employed as his nur^e.
JMve days after that he deeded his real es
tate to hi r and transferred to her posses
sion alt of his cash.
Becker lived less than three weeks after
triving his property to his new-made wife.
He left a will which provided that his
property should go to his relatives, ana
thai Mr. Burmeister should act as execu
tor. In view of these circumstances, ana
considerine the allegation that Becker was
physically and mentally weak and under
the domination of his nurse, judgment of
the court is asked to compel her to refund
;he cash and to reconvey to Mr. Burtueis
ter, for the benefit of his heirs and lega
tees under the will, as no other properly
belonging to the testator can be found.

How the Drink of Morphine Habit Is Treated by Hypnotism Over at Angel Island
ALLY a medical journal
l^'l-' wi 'l recite the employment of
hypnoti: m experimentally, in some
hospital in France, with the commentary
of a view ot some physician upon a case
whicn has fallen under his observation in
this country, but few persons in San Fran
cisco are aware that hypnotism as a regu
lar department of therapeutics is daily
successfully practiced in one of the Govern
ment hospitals in this department, and
that it has been so practiced with varying
success for no less than three years.
This hospital is on Angel Island, and
the introduction of hypnotism into the
formulas of treatment there is due to the
progressive spirit and wide learning of its
physician in charge, Major Pope. The
major is wonderfully read in hypnotic
lore, and. while he does not himself hyp
notize, the operations are done under his
directions, end he keeps careful watch
over the subject during the period of his
treatment. But hypnotism is not practiced
in ti.e Government service alone on
Angel Island ; it is now quite common in
nearly all hospitals of this character
throughout the country. The reason
nothing has been said of it outside of the
numerous reports of cases in medicai
journal-, framed in the scientific language
which so few laymen care to read, is the
usually remove 1 situations of these cara
vansaries, whereby they are generally out
of the ken of the daily prints. In this
respect it might be said that the military
hospitals are leading like establishments
of the civil sort, for the surgeon-general
of the army has reported on it time and
again, always professing the fullest faith
in it and speaking interestedly of the
progress of its use in the hospitals of the
vice.
1 would seem that the army presented
\ :ield the most suggestive of the employ
ment of hypnotism in treating the cases
which are commonest to rise within it.
These are soldiers afflicted with the liquor
habit. Soldiers are proverbially drinkers;
many of them are hard drinkers, and, as
liquor is always obtainable at the post ex
change or store, called the "canteen,"
there is opportunity to dnnk to excess
even on the reservation. It is after a pro
tracted spree, and perhaps a sobering up
â¢ in the guardhouse, that Johnny, the sol
dier, is sent to the hospital, to be there
dealt with according to this recent school
of application of the mysterious and but
slightly understood forces in animal life
which our ignorance terms odic, and rele
gates to the occult.
That pale and insidious destroyer, the
c contributes its annual quota of
victims to the candidature for hypnotic
treatment, for the callow, smooth-faced
Johnny, like his counteipart in civilian
li.'c, shows the sallow skin and bronze
finger stains of the creature succumbed to
t' c dt'mon Nicotine, and who has become
a liend of his family.
Experience at the hospital has shown
that all persons are not susceptible to
hypnotic influence, neither are all persons
capable of becoming operators. Major
Pope himself frankly admits tbat he b
I not organized to develop into an opera-
I tor. He finds those persons make the
1 kest subjects who are nervously pros
> i.cd; the fellow so "jagged" that he
ices snakes when ha shuts his eyes, the
cigarette victim whose nervousness occv
sions extreme diffidence, so that nis hand:
tremble and his speech falters, toe suffer
ers from bad habits which render them
wrecks and prostratesâ these are the be
ings who, presenting the opposite exlremi
ia the elements essential to the aeldier,
come to the Hospital to have the potential
passes made over their faces and their
eyes closed in hypnotic sleep by the fin
gers of the operator.
Although Major Pope does not himself j
hypnotize he is sagacious in the selection ;
of an operator. During the yeais that this i
force has been employed at the hospital ,
there have beeti two men connected with |
the institution who possessed singular j
ability in the exercise of the power and a '
third was developing into an operator ;
when he was called away. Tlie last and j
the strongest dynamo of this influence is j
the present operator at the hospital,
Charles yon Radesky, an Austrian physi- j
cian about 40 years old, who, preferring j
the certainty of congenial employment, ;
even at low wages, in the Government ser- |
vice to the precariousnpss of a medical j
practice upon the outside, has accepted
the cffiee of senior steward of the hospital.
Major Pope uses Dr. vcn Radesky's power ;
very much as he would employ an elec- j
trie battery. He does not beiievd in the !
Keely cure, and though it is In vogue at j
some places in the Government service, j
it is not resorted to on the island. Hyp- \
notism he applies in treatment along with j
treatment of the regular medicinal char- j
acter, good nursing and close attention to
the patient.
Invariably the major endeavors to excite
in the patient a desire to be cured of his
habit. Generally the poor victim is glad
enough to aid the physician in this regard
so far as bis shattered will affords, and he
is usually anxious to be free from the ap
petite which often throughout his life has
been his besetting pitfall and the cause of
th*e most fatal of his misfortunes. In this
bringing of the mind to bear against the
disease, the major draws a distinction be
tween desire and resolve. He gives no
heed to a resolution of a patient not to
drink any more; it is his desire, his yearn
ing for immunity from the vice that is ef
fective; it is not a mere line drawn in the
man's conduct which he promises himself
and others not to cross, but it is a condi
tion of mind which must be generated in
the patient under which the doing of such
and such thine becomes something not :o
be thought of, and the thoughts to be
turned to something else whenever the
doing of such thing is suggested from
without.
With all the medicine, therefore, and
with the aid of hypnotism, the major
does not hold that the drink or other
habits can be cured where the paiient
willfully sets himself to resume his habit
after the treatment is concluded, or where
he does not himself bring his mind against
it. The fact seems to be that what is
done at the hospital is to rid the patient
of the physical craving of his habit, to
put his body in a condition of health with
regard to it, to place him in about the
state he was IB before he had taken his
first drink or performed the first act of
his habit. If having been thus restored
he wisnes to again resume his ancient as
suetude there are no bars, save the known
consequences, upon his so doint;. Gener
ally, however, the patient does not re
lapse. In the seventy-thfee cases which
have been treated by hypnotism at the
hospital only half a dozen have recurred
:o the habits of their diseases.
The methods which Dr. yon Radesky
employs in his hypnotic operations while
they are most effective do not appear to
be appreciated or viewed with peculiar de
light by the rank and file. A soldier in
his sky-blue surcoat and white cotton
gloves was carrying a shouldered musket
on sentry duty up and down a graveled

walk. I asked him what |he thought of
the hypnotic drink treatment at the hos
pital.
"Tut, it's a fake," he replied, his man
ner revealing the indifference and scorn
with which he reviled it. But whatever
it be assuredly its practice has produced a
strengthening of the morale in the men of
the command on the island. The officers
are effusive in their present declarations
that the men are of high type, sober, and
that the guardhouse is rarely occupied. It
was not always so, else there could not
have been seventy-three patients* ont of a
body cf 200 or so men to be treated in
three years. I have said that the soldier
at the hospital usually assists the operator
in banishing his desire for drink, but it is
in a spirit something after that in which
the occupant of the electrocution chair
aids his executioner. The fact is that the
men riread hypnotism and look upon Dr.
yon Radesky as something that is loaded.
To what extent this desirable awe has in
fluenced tbe tone of the command is. of
course, incomputable; but that it has so
operated there is no doubt.
And well it might, for the operation of
Dr. yon Kadesky upon a patient is not an
J experience through which one would wish
I to pass by reason of its agreeabie sensa
j tions. The exhibition of one of these
j operations blends the curious with the
i humorous and the grim to a remarkable
degree. The treatment is (riven in the
; long ward of the hospital, replete with
j its beds, some of them occupied by other
] patients. Private Smith has been
; "boozy" for a week. A night in the guard
: house has left him with the jiggers, and
i his brain is full of smoke. His hair
stands out in feather tufts, and his beard
' is matted with tobacco juice and sand.
His fle-h is soiled, his garments are dirty
and iiis hreath exhales a strength that
would float an egg. Private Smith is sod
! den, foul of speech and stench and vis
i ibiy miserable. If he were in civil life he
1 would be a tramp when sober aud in jail
j when drunk; but being in the service of
the Government there are those who will
I see to it that his tortuous way of error is
â  somewhat mended, that he himself is
j tinctured up, that his hide is scraped and
polished, the afflictions of his past in some
measure cleaned away and that he be
htted again for reception into soldier so
i ciety.
DR. CHARLES YON RODESKY, U. S. A.
1 He has a bath and a clean shift, then he
is put to b.'d. Rio is given a little bro
mide, but he continues restless. Dr. yon
Kadesky lemoves his glasses and views
him.
" Go to sleep," says the doctor.
"I can't sleep," returns Smith.
"But you can sleep," says the doctor,
waving his hands before his eye?. "You
are very sleepy, you are going to sleep
now; you will be asleep in a moment."
A few passes more, the doctor closes
Smith's eyelids, holds his fingers for an
instant on the balls, and the patient is
fast asleep.
In an hour the doctor again approaches
him and, while he is still sleeping, turns
him on his side and speaks in his ear:
''You don't like beer or whisty or gin
! or any kind of drink," says the doctor.
"It make? you sick whenever you try to
drink it. The reason it makes you sick is
that it is not beer or whisky or gin, but it
lis sewer water. It looks like good drink,
I bat it is not fit to drink. It smells like
I sewer water, for it stinks, and it tastes
like sewer water and it makes you sicfc.
When you swallow it you cannot keep it
NOTEâ Organ Rock is a high and rugged mass of stone standing
upon the southern coast of Monterey Bay. It was known to the Indians
as Point Aulon, but bears the modern name of Organ Rock by reason
of the local tradition that there is a vast cave beneath it, which opens
on the bay below high-water mark, and that when tides rise high or
stormy billows dash upon the rock a listener at its base can catch the
hollow and muffled roar of the surges beating within the cavern below.
on your stomach; you will puke it vp â
ugb â b-r-r-."
Smith does not rouse, but continues his
sleep: when he does awake be feels dizzy,
uncomfortable. He has no appetite, can
not eat the broth brought him. The
second steward asks h:m if he would like
to have a little whisky. He thinks he
would. Whisky is brought in a glass;
the private takes it, put? it to his lips, but
his lips being just beneath his nose he is
forced to smell it.
"Phew! that stuff stinks! neh, that
ain't whisky! b-r-r-take it away! Where's
the bucket?" He gags and gasps and sick
at the stomach he flons over in bed again
until his nausea passes off.
That night Smith takes some more
medicine to soothe his nervous state and
tone up his stomach, which retains a little
food; he continues to be troubled with
bugs and serpents crawl across his vision;
occasionally in nis delirium he will cry
out, but presently when the drugs get well
at work the snakes will wiggle off and he
will sleep quietly. Then Dr. yon Radesky
will find his ear again and say:
"In the morning when you wake up you
will go down to the canteen and buy a
glass of beer. It will look like beer, but it
will be sewer water â all beer is sewer
waterâ and it will taste like sewer water.
You will drink it, but you will not hold it
on your stomach. You will vomit it upâ
you will vomit violently, you will retch
and you will hurry back to the hospital
and go to bed."
When Smith wake 3up he does not care
to eat. The drink thirst has not yet left
him and lie is very miserable. He dresses
himself and says nothing, but sneaks off.
A few minutes after he bring up at the
canteen. Nervously he fumbles among
the dust of his pocket for a lew nickels to
pay for a bottle of beer. The Keeper of the
canteen understanding the situation sells
it to him. He lifts the foaming glass to
his lips.
"Whew! SomethJn's th' matter with
that beer." He takes a swallow of it.
"Ugh !1t me get to the door ! Oh, heav
ens!" The beady sweat stands on the
cold brow of the sick man as he moves his
way. speedily as his condition will allow,
to the hospital, wLere he quickly resumes
his tea.
Clearly a "put-up job" on Private
Smith; a hard ordeal on him to have a
burning thirst and when refreshment is
tendered to rind it give off an effluvia
which renders it horrible, revolting,
which nauseates him, makes him loathe
it in disgust. Old Midas, with his gold
touch, starving for nutriment which his
tongue turned to yellow wealth, was not
worse ufflicied.
Eut Smith is not more uncomfortable
than that thin young man who sits over
yonder by the table, dejected, looking
wearily at the floor. To him every cigar
ette is a serpent's tongue. It frightens
him when he sees one. Let him forget a
moment, take one of the things and put
it to his lips; it bites themâ sets them
afire; in horror he throws the thing &way,
yet he yearns to smoke them, but he can
not. Major Pope's medicine, good nurs
ing, good food, wi 1 ere long relieve him
of this appetite, but for months ke will
carry in his mind the sense that a cigar
ette is the arrowhead tongue of a snake ;
that it "biteth like a serpent and stingeth
like an adder," and by the time this no
tion has worn away he will have no desire
to smoke again, and perhaps he will never
resume the habit.
The result is the same with Smith. His
abused old stomach recovers its natural
functions, the drink thirst wanes, taen dis
appears; food is assimilated; he gains
flesh. He cannot think of drink but that
it seems offensive; a wave of sickness
passes over him if he contemplates it.
If he adds to his condition the desire to
refrain from liquor he does not think of it.
He soon forgets it and when he is restored
to his duties it does not occur to him to
take a drink.
"What is my theory?" replied Dr. yon
Radesky in reply to my question. "I
have a very clearly denned one. I de
stroy the brain-cells which call for drink.
Every habit, eyery wrong appetite, is the
result of infinite numbers of impressions
upon the brain. Men do not have abnor
mal appetites when they start in life.
You hear of men who take a drink more
readily than others, and because their
fathers drank tney say they inherited
their appetites; but these men all had to
drink first before they could acquire an.
appetite for drink, ana if they had not
done so they would not known what such
an appetite was. So, you see, for every
drink a man takes a separate impression
is made upon his mind, and that impres
sion means that a new cell is built up in
the brain.
"I hold to the theory that all brain im
pressions produce cells and that accord
ins? to the number of these cells 13
measured the strength of the propensity
of the individual to perform such acts as
have produced those cells. Tell a child
'this is sugar' ; it will forget what you say;
but tell it again and again, repeated on
different occasions, 'this is sugar, this is
sugar, 1 and you have soon corresponding
cells built up in its brain that such a thing
is sugar that it would be hard to efface
them.
"Now," continued the doctor, "what I
do is to build up counter C6lls in the brain
of the man who drinks. Ido this through
impressing him with thoughts which are
antagonistic to the thoughts which pro
duced bis cells, to the thoughts produced
by those cells. 1 secure this by impres
sions, always the same impressions, re
peated ruany times and at periods and
under conditions so that his will cannot
be brought to oppose or suppress them. 1
crush down his will, then his brain is
mine and I impress it as I like. This is
the principle of hypnotism in the treat
ment of disease as I conceive."
Whatever may be the theory the fact is
that science has introduced at Angel
Inland an influence in behalf of sobriety
more potential than all the temperance
lectures and prohioition laws that hava
ever been uttered or written.

Its tiny face, with cheek oi piak,
From hood of green was peeping.
The sunbeam gazed upon the rose,
And fondly he caressed it;

With kiss too ardent pressed id
And though he softly bathed the wound,
Though night, with tears, him aided,
In life, and c'en in death, the scar
Still never, never faded.

It is a repetition of the same old story in !
the navy, where, if something goes wrong
with a nigh rank line officer, an example by
vicarious punishment is made of the low
e.-t in the grade who may by any means, j
fair or foul, be connected with the affair.
The navy abounds in such stories, some
sad, others with happy endings and others
again ludicrous. An incideut of twenty
eight years ayo is an instance where a
younft subaltern was made to suffer for
the faults of higher rank officers, but hap
pily through the providential interference
of two women came off without any last
ing tilight on his record.
In 1868 the l! nited States steamer Canan
daigua, attached to the squadron of Ad
miral Farragut in European waters, was
in the Adriatic, bound south to join the
squadron in British and French waters.
Her commanding officer was Captain
James H. Strong; E. P. McCrea, execu
tive officer; J. I>. Ciark, navigator, and R.
P. Leary, equipment and ordnance officer,
with Master Heyerman and Ensigns Con
verse and De Long watch officers. The
executive was detached, pending promo
tion, before the ship sailed from Venice,
and was succeeded by Lieutenant-Com
mander E. J. Dickman. On March 8, 1868,
the navigator died, and Lieutenant Leary
modestiy declining the honor of assum
ing navigation duties, there were none
others in the ship considered competent
for such service, and it became necessary
to pick out an officer from some other
ship, and Master B. L. Edes, serving on
the Saco, was selected.
In the latter days of May the Canan
daigua started for the Mediterranean, and
everything went well. The captain, fond
of the good things in life which the navy
brings to a high-rank officer, took matters
easy and left the ship entirely to the care
of the executive, and the latter with
commendable ambition took upon him
self the duties of navigating the ship.
On the morning of May 30, while the ves
sel was proceeding under easy steam and
sail aiong the coast of Italy, the shores of
which were quite plainly visible, a sudden
fog bank obscured the beautiful scenery,
and the captain proceeded to take a bath,
On the quarterdecK Dickman and Edes
pored over the chart and concluded to
change the course, and the former, by
virtue of his rank and greater experience
in working a ship under such circum
stances, took command and ordered Mr.
Edes to go forward and attend to the
handling of the sails by the crew. The
ship's course was changed, and in ac
cordance with navy regulations Dickroan
reported in person to the captain in the
bathtub the change of course, to which
ths latter assented with a spluttering "All
right" without looking at the chart. In a
few minutes, however, it was all wrong, for
the ship's keel came suddenly in con
tact with some part of submerged Italian
soil, spilling the captain out of his tub
and otherwise annoying otlicers and crew,
and when the fog soon after lifted the ship
was found with its nose in close proximity
to a peaceful and picturesque vineyard,
located between Ostussi and lirindisi, at
the beginning of the so-called heel of
Italy. About forty milps of mountainous
land Intervened between tlie bow of the
ship and the Bay of Toranto, and the short
cut, however desirable a.l time-savine,
was impracticable. Afler three days' un
remitting effort, during which lighters,
tugs and boats sent from the friendly
people on tne coast lightened the ship,
and with a final desperate attempt the
vessel and the muddy bottom parted com
pany and the Canandaigua proceeded on
her voyage to England.
In con:ormity with article 10 of the arti
cles of wnr Admiral Farragnt ordered a
court-martial on Lieuteuftut-CowmanUer
Dickraan, July 14, 1856, but the court ex
onerated the navigator, as he proved to
the satisfaction of the court t:at he had
complied with the navy regulations in in
forming the captain of the changed course,
after which his responsibility ceased.
Admiral Farragut was furious, scored the
court severely and b'untiy intimated that
some one must be held responsible for the
stranding of the ship. In consequence
Master B. L. Edes was hanled up before
the court and in short order wa* tried,
convicted and sentenced to two years' sus
pension.
It was not until March 11, 18G9, that
Captain Strona was court-martialed at the
New York Navy-yard, charged with suf
fering a vessel of the navy, through his
negligence, to be stranded ; with having
neglected to keep a night order-book from
April 1 to May 30, 1868, and neglecting to
heave the lead while the ship was ap
proaching land. T.ie court was unable, it
appears, to prove any of the charges, and
he was consequently acquitted.
In the person of Master Edes, however,
it was apparently quite in oonformity to
the regulations that an example had been
made, although his inexperience in the
first place should have excluded him from
even the acting position of navigator.
Master B. Edes Long, or B. Long Edes,
as he transposed his name in I?tj2, entered
the naval academy in September, I*6l, at
the age of 14 years and 0 months, and
graduated in October, 16G.5. He had, there
fore, only about three years' sea experi
ence at the age of 21, when selected to
navicaie a large ahiplifee the Canandaigua,
while Dickman, who took charge, had
nearly six years' and the captain was
credited with twenty-two years' sea
service. However, the court took no cog
nizance of these details, but promptly
found him guilty â as they generally do
when the accused, in addition to low rank,
lacks political influence â and the sentence
would probably have been earned into
effect to its full eztent but lor the sequel.
Master Edes, on sentence being ap
proved, was no longer an officer of the
snip and proceeded in it to England in
order to join some naval vessel bound for
the United States. Arriving in England
the entire squadron, including the flag
ship Franklin, had a general good time,
enjoying with Farragut the hospitality of
British statesmen and others who did
honor to the American admiral. During
the close of 186S the Canandaigua, then at
Gravesend, was ordered to proceed to
THE FRIEND IN NEED.
France, carryine Admiral Farragut's wife
and Mrs. Pennock, wife of the captain of
the Frantclin, over to Calais, where they
were to take the irain for Paris.
I'wo officers, whose names have escaped
the writer's memory, but one of whom
was a surgeon, were charged to look after
the safety and comforts of the ladies, and
the trip across the channel wasuneve.it
ful. Arriving in the French port the
ladies were escorted to a hotel pending
the departure of the train, and the doctor
and his friend went uptown on an explor
ing expedition, with the result that both
of them were unable â or lorgot â to keep
their appointment, and as a consequence
Mrs. Farragut and Mrs. Pennoek, after a
long, anxious waiting, left the hotel and
came down to the dspot.
There were no escorts in sight, nor was
their baggage on hand, and but for the
opportune appearance of Master Edes the
ladies would have been put to great in
convenience. The young man saw the
opportunity of his iiie and, working as he
had never done before, got the baggage
from the hotel, secured tickets (including
one for himself), and escorted the ladies
to their destination in Paris. Mr. Edes'

was, of course, familiar to Mrs. Farragut
and Mrs. Pennock, and when four weeks
later a letter came from the Secretary of
the Navy to Master Edes informing him
that his sentence had been remitted and
that he was restored to duty, it was gen
erally surmised that his courtesy to the
iaaies at a very critical time had resulted
beneficially to himself.
Nearly all of the officers mentioned in
the above incidents are dead. Captain

1882. B. L. Edes was killed by the acci

Jhe Origin of the Zunis.
The Zuni Indians tell a pretty story of
the origin of their race. In the beginning
there sprang up from the earth a race of
men. The race increased until it spread
Ofer all. the earth, and after existing lor
countless ages passed away again. The
earth was then devoid of human life fora
long time, or until the sun taking com
pass-ion on the earth on account of its
loneliness, sent a heavenly maiden to re
oeople it. The young goddess was called
Arizonia, signifying '-Maiden Queen."
One clay a drop of dew fell from heaven
upon Arizonia, and in due time she bore
two children â a son and a dau -hterâ and
these became thii father and mother of the
Zunis, and from this tribe sprang all the
races of the earth.

|!"%VN the Klamath reservation, in Ore

g eon, there is living an Indian
*Lm3)7 woman, the wife of a white man
named Frank Riddle. Her name is un
familiar to the world, her history is un
known to many of those who sea her
daily.. With only the companionship of
her white-haired husband and her one
son, Jeff Riddle, she lives quietly and ob
scurely from day to day.
She was born over fifty years ago there
in the southern partof Oregon, among the
dismal lava beds. Her father was chief of
the Modocs, a man of exceptional bravery
â tall, strong and well built. They say
that he was handsome and fleet of foot;
that the women loved and the men feared
him, and that this daughter, wnom he
called Wi-ne-ma, was like him. However
that may be, it is true that when Wi-ne-ma
had reached the age of 18, Frank Riadle. a
young raaÂ» who had left his Kentucky
home in search of rold, fell deeply in love
with her, and they were married.
Wi-ne-ma had a. ways had a strong lik
ing for the white settlers, which was not
shared by her father nor the others of her
tribe. Her marriage strengthened her re
gara for her husband's people : stie spared
no pains to keep peace and prevent blood
shed, and this, mark you, was not an easy
thing to do.
The Indians hated the white men. Their
sense of wrong was keenly developed. A
treacherous race themselves, they feared
treachery from others, and tbey looked
with disfavor upon eyery move of the new
settlers.
In 1850 a band of adventurers who had
come West for gold caused disturbance
among the Indians. A few months later
the Indians retaliated by swooping down
upon them and patting them all to death.
As an outcome of this, Ben Wright, at the
head of a number of whites, started for
Yreka fully determined to punish the In
dians forthe death of their countrymen.
The country was rough and hard to travel
over. The Indians knew every inch of the
way and they gave Ben Wright's men a
hard cba-<e. Finally they resolved to meet
together and make a treaty; a truce was
declared and the opposing parties went
into camp at some distance from each
other on Lost River.
On the morning of the day on which the
conference^yas to be held a young squaw
hurried into the camp of tt<e white men
and asked to see Ben Wright. She was a
pathetic sight as she was led bofore him.
Her feet were bare and torn by rocks, her
garments were rent, her dark hair hung
unkempt about her shoulders and her
face showed sicns of weariness.
When asked what she had to say she
hurriedly explained that her people out
numbered his, three to one. She told him
that the night before, at the council fire,
she had learned that while their fchiefs were
conferring with the wliite men they had
planned to surround the whole party and
kill them. Then Wi-ne-ma, for it was she,
refusing to remain a second longer, for
fear her people would find that she had
been there, stole away back to her lodge.
That day the white men went into am
bush and surrounded the Indians. Only
two escaped the slaughter, which is known
to history as the Ben Wright massacre.
During the years that followed the Mo
docs, like all other Indian tribes in the
West, were given a reservation and com
pelled to live thereon. They rebelled
against the loss of the wild freedom they
had enjoyed. They could not hunt, their
lands were appropriated by the hated
whites, whom they had failed to drive
out, the treaties which thay made with
the Government were repeatedly broken
and they were not strong enough to avert
the punishment* that followed.
All this time Wi-ne-ma stayed among
them. When they armed for strife 6he
took their weapons from them, and when
she herself could not calm them she
warned the settlers and orticers of the
army and sought to have the trouble
righted.
After twenty-one years had passed the
Modocs had become stron : again. There
had been small outbreaks during this
time, but apparently they were sub
dued. The older chiefs, however, had not
forgotten. The fires of revenge had b^en
only smoldering. They kept the Ben
Wright massacre with all its terrors fresh
in the minds of the younger braves. At
last they determined to even up their ac
count by slauehter.
After hostilities began the Government
sent peace commissioners 10 confer with
tbe savageÂ«, but the latter refused to
meet them. The only while man whom
the Indians had any faith in was Judge
Elijah Sieele. Although they refused to
meet the peace commissioners, they con
sented to meet Steele and two other men
and to up their arms to them on Hie
following day. At the appoinied time
Steele and the other men were at the
place agreed upon, out there was not an
Indian in sight, so they returned to the
military camp. Steele then consented to
interview the war chief alone. He re
paired at night to the Indian camp, and
had an experience that was frightfully
unique. While Captain Jack and a few
others sat around the fire talking, part of
the time in English, to Steele on the sub
ject in hand and considering terms of sur
renderâin their own language the rest of
the time they were-actuully discussing the
advisability of murdering their visitor.
Steeie understood their langunge suffi
ciently well to know what tliey were say-
Ing, but he did not betray his knowleciee,
and they finally decided to spare his life,
tbat he might bring the ofiicers and peace
commissioners to confer with them.
Colonel Meacnam, who was in charge of
the military post at the Klamath reserva
tion, had done all in his power to alleviate
the wrongs of the oppressed people. On
account of his efforts he had woii the
gratitude of Wi-ne-ma. At this time Wi
ne-ma did all in her power to per.-uade
Meacham not to go to meet t lie Indians.
When she found herself unable to restrain
him she followed on her pony.
When Meacham arrived at the appointed
place he was attacked by Sconchin, an in
furiated redskin. Wi-ne-ma threw herself
upon her countryman begging him to
spare the life of her friend. When the
other warriors cirae up she ran from one
to another, turning aside their weapons
and begging tnem not' to shoot. A bullet,
however, struct Aleacbam, rendering him
senseless. Then Wi-ne-ma declared that
he was dead to prevent hi 3 being shot
again :ind snatched the knife with which
a brave attempte 1 to scalp him. The
Indian struck her a blow, which dnzed
her. Realizing that she could no longer
control her people she bethought herself
of a last resource and cried out that the
soldiers were coming. The savages beat
a hasty retreat and soon a detachment of
troops did appear.
Wi-ne-ma nursed Meacham back to life,
although he always remained a cripple,
broken in health. She helped him to
reach his wife and family in safely, and
then returned to her husband.
The colonel never forgot ncr faithful
ness, but did all in his power to aid her
people during the remainder of his life.
After his death the brave little woman en
dured many hardships, but lately the Gov
ernment has come to her assistance and
granted her a pension of $20 a month.
Wi-ne-ma certainly has a history that any
woman might be proud of. She is the
only woman in the United States who 19
drawing a pension for so much heroism
and bravery.
And the faded calico gowns and the little
cotton shawl that she wears about her
head are not what we expect a heroine to
wear. Perhaps the lodge in which she
lives and her manner of living are not just
what we might enjoy. But Wi-ne-ma's
life has been worth the living.

The pope's Dominant J rait.
My friend, Paul Bourget, defines the
American as "a man who invariably uses
the ntwest method." This is also the
dominant trait in ihe character of Leo
XIII. Within the measure permitted
him by a heavy chain of traditions, he
does not hesitate to grasp the most
modern weapons in defense of his ancient
faith; and this deliberate boldness ex
plains his jxMichant for the American
character. But iir those very innovations
whicn most alarm his timid advisers, he
is conscious of being far less an innovator
than a restorer of forgotten traditions. He
relies upon the examples set by the great

Doing Big Business Without Money
JKe Co-OperatiVe Labor Exchange Claims to fi&\?e Solved the
JMoney Problem by Dismissing JMoney Entirely
Bp^HERE is a large wholesale business
VI Â»? uouse down at 322 Davis street that
3*s& has done a business of $28,000 with
in the last eiijht months, wholly without
money. Nor is it in debt for one dollar.
It expects to go rieht along doing business
in exactly the same way â without money.
It has crown from a very small affair, lo
cated out on Tenth street, a year ago, to
its present healthy proportions by the
same method*, and bases its future expec
tations upon what it has accomplished. It
claini9 to have poived the "Money ques
tion" by dismissing money entirely â hav
ing nothing to do with it.
This business concern is the Labor Ex
change. It is not a mere local co-opera
tive affair. T: c Labor Exchange is a
National institution that, in spite of the
sneers and prophecies of failure that it
met at its inception and that have, fol
lowed it along its course, seems to have
reached a point where it may demand
respectful study and consideration.
The idea upon which it is founded is
WAREHOUSE OF THE BIG CO-OPERATIVE ESTABLISHMENT ON DAVIS STREET.
very f-imple. Its purpose is to employ
every man who has an opportunity to pro
duce anything by finding a market for the
product â to find some other man who
wants the product and who ha 9 some
thing to for it. It is by this
means that the use of money is dispensed
with.
It is worked in thi3 way. A shoemaker,
for instance, wants a barrel of flour. He
eets to work and makes a whole lot of
shoes of the value of the thing he wants,
takes ihem to the exchange and receives
the flour, if ho wants something that is
not in the exchange â for instance, if he
wants a new set of teethâ he is given a
check or checks of the value of
the product he leaves there, and
goes away to some dentist who
belongs to the exchange and who therefore
will accept the;checks for his work. The
dentist is not required to take the shoes
in exchange for his work â the check 3 will
be accepted at the exchange for anything
there in stock. Xor is the dentist even
limited to this. These checks are ac
cepted by a score or more of other busi
ness houses in almost every line of trade,
so widely has the movement spread.
So that Labor Exchange checks are com
ing into general circulation and serving
not merely as a substitute, but in some
respects as an improvement upon money.
They are an improvement to the extent
that they serve all the purposes in lacili
tating exciiange without being subject to
taxation.
That question lias been raised at Wash
ingtonâthe institution has reached such
proportions as to have forced attention at
Washingtonâ and the Attorney-General
declared that inasmuch as the checks were
not redeemable in legal tender they could
not be taxed.
No, ttiat ia just the difference. Every
check of the Labor Exchange found in
circulation represents some product of
labor. They are redeemable In labor or
the product of labor and nothing else.
That is the whole scheme.
ThÂ« leaders in the Labor Exchange
inovemant are fond of telling a story that
illustrates their theory or pian as wt 11 as
anything can. The people of the island
of Guernsey felt the need of a big market
place. They did not have the capital to
put up the necessary building, and it was
proposed in their Council to issue bonds,
send a commission to Paris to sell them
ami with the capital so raised do the thing
they desired. The Governor of Guernsey,
however, was a longheaded fellow and
something of a new-fangled financier him
self. He said:
"If you wish to build a market for the
French people that is the very thing to do.
If you wish to build a market for your
selves it is a very foolish thing."
"But how are we to build the market?"
said the Councilors. "We have no
money."
"You have plenty of men to do the
work, have you?"
"Oh, yes; there are many laborers who
need employment,'' they said.
'You have the timber necessary and
the stone and other, materials on the
island?"
"Oh, yen; plenty of it."
"Then why not go to work and build
it? You have all that is necessary. Why
go in debt to the French people for what
you yourselves have? See, if you borrow
the money to put up this building you
will have to do all the work just the same
aud when it 13 finished you will not own
it. More than that you will have to pay
interest on the debt. That will consume
a large part of the revenues of the build
ing when finished, so it may never be paid
for. Instead of issuing interest-bearing
bonds, which other people will gladly ac
cept, why not i>sue notes without interest
and accept them yourselves? The notes
may be made acceptable by the town for
rent in the market when it is ready for
business and in this way will redeem
themselves."
The Governor's advice was taken, the
market-house was the notes cir
culated at par during the process and
afterward until they all Gnally found their
way into the town treasury. The market
ho'ise ha.l been built and paid for with
out the employment of money or without
the payment of one cent of interest.
This is the plan upon which the Labor
Exchange is working. It has met with
great difficulties, chief of which is doubt
as to the possibility of getting its scheme
en a stable footing. As it grows this
doubt dissolves, of course, before the proof
furnished. Branches are being established
all over the country, and especially in the
West. There are nourishing branches in
this State at Fresno, Ventura, Red Bluff,
Yisalia, Bnkersfield, Tulare, Banta Maria,
Eureka, Plat", Carpenteria, â¢ Santa Paula
San Diego, StocKton, Oakdale and adozen
other places.
These exchange all. manner of goods
with each other. There are snch things
as socks and cigars from as distant a
point as Reading, Pa., at the Davis-street
Exchange, broom handles from away at
New Whatcom, Wash., fruit extracts from
Fresno, as well as fruit from as far south
as San Diego. A consignment of shirts
and overalls is being negotiated for with a
branch in Ohio. A lot of dried fruit was
yesterday shipped to Idaho Falls, Idaho,
in exchange for port, ana groceries were
sent to Armona. in Kings County, in ex
change for dried fruit.
The branch at Red Bluff is putting up a
spicemill, the branch at Los Angeles is
puttinc up a shoe factory and the branch
at Olathe, Ksns., is building a gristmill.
The branch at Salem, Or., is a step in
advance of ail the others and indicates
the high-water mark of a movement of
which the Boston Transcript rr cently said :
Under the surface of all this storm over
silver and gold, there Is in progress a remark
able movement which probably not one Bos
tonian in a thousand has ever heard of, and
which tnreatens to absorb utterly in a few
years all labor and financial and social reform
movements. It is ihe Labor Exchange.
These organizations have undertaken to
build a railroad on exactly the plan upon
which the people of Guernsey built their
market-house. Subscriptions of $100,000,
noi in dollars, but in land, materials and
provender, have been subscriDed.and these
will be pledged for the rails and rolling
stock, things that cannot be secured with
the exchange checks. All the labor, the
ties, etc.. will be paid for with these
checks, which will be accepted for traffic
charges when the road is completed. The
road to be built is a strip twenty-five miles
long, extending into the prolific farming
country of the Willamette V r alley.
The movement will shortly be amplified
by the issuance of checks against real
estate for what improvements may be
made upon it by labor. In other words, a
member of the exchange owning a Jot
may have a house built upon it by other
members, who will accept the real-estate
checks. The r>lan is that of the building
and loan association carried on without
money â and without interest. The checks
would be issued by the exchange and
made partly redeemable by it for proven
der. The house, being built, would be
owned by the exchaugeâ that is, by every
member of it. The rent from it (pre
sumably paid by the man having it built)
would be paid into the exchange until it
amounted to the sum of iis cost. Then a
deed would be given to the new owner â
exactly the Guernsey transaction over
again.
This feature of the movement will not
be developed before spring. The man
ager of the big store or exchange of branch
26 at 322 Davis street is Henry Wartield,
who has been attached 10 the movement
since its introduction la this City less
than two years ago. The heart of the
Labor Exchange movement is G. de Bar
dini of Independence, Mo. In a boos pub
lished in 1889 be explained his theory. It
was taken up by some workers at Paff
town, who started a brick works by the
simple issuance of their own checks. The
brick works are going yet in a full flood
of prosperity, the only chance in their
plan being a substitution of the checks of
the central exchange, which has since or
| ganized. The success of this initial un
dertaking has been repealed in nearly
every State of the Union, and the move
ment keeps growine until, as stated by
the Boston Transcript, it bids fair to ab
sorb all other labor reforms.
A meeting is to be held tbis evening at
Fraternity Hull, Pythian Castle. 909
Market street, under the auspices of branch
26, at wi ich I. S.Clark, the State organ. zer.

will be an open one, the public being
welcome.

He is the largest boy on earth, that is of
his age, of course.
He has lived sixteen years on this man

Notoniy that, Dut he keeps on growing

This wonderful young man is a native

His name is Mervyn Newberg, and he

Mervyn always was very large, even as
a very young boy ; but at the asre of twelve
he began to gain in weight and stature so
rapidly that it was said you could almost
see him grow. Now when he passes to

and stare at him in uiter amazement, for
his face betrays his youshfulness.
But Mervyn is not only large physic

Dogs, cats, parrots and canaries were all
very well, the poet declared, but only a
damsel who petted "the gentle gazelle"
could hope to win his heart. Were that
poet in San Francisco to-iiay his heart â 
must needs remain in his own keeping, ;
since diligent inquiry has failed to dis- j
cover such an animai among our city's j
many pets. The feminine mind here, as i
elsewhere, inclines to birds, cats and small
dogs, as a general thing; the masculine 1
to horses and the larger varieties of the j
genus canis, and "the bright gazelle with
its silvery feet" is not apparently in de- !
mand.
The day of the English pugâ the corpu
lent snarly-noted little fellow, with the !
shoulder-brace and double Alsatian bow i
attachmentâ has pone by. Heis no longer '
fashionable, and although he may still be
cherished by a few fond hearts, his siock
has gone down much below par among
bis whilom society Iriends. In his place j
now appears the pretty little Japanese
spaniel, miscalled the Japanese pue, and
no one in town has a more charming spe
cimen of this breed than Miss Jennie
Blair. Miss Blair is noted among her
friends for her discriminating fondness
for dogs, and she oÂ«fns only such as are of
most aristocratic lineage. Her dogs are \
all perfectly trained, but there are no j
"tricks" in their course of study. They;
are pets pure and simple, and live their j
lives freely and happily, repaying their |
mistress' kindness by the most devoted i
attachment. Two of Miss Blair's dogs, a |
Yorkshire terrier and a Maltese poodle,
have died recently, but there are four re
maining, of which a Yorkshire terrier, im
ported three months since, is perhaps the
most notable. Shamrock is said to be the
finest animal of his kind now in thiscoun- j
try, and is a beautiful creature, weighing '.
only four and three-quarter pounds, and j
possessed of a pedigree as long as "Me- j
Cleish's ac dochter." Of her two re- !
markably fine Cocker spaniels, Jill and
Prince, Jill is specially noted for her ami- j
abiity and intelligence, but Shika, the lit
tie Japanese, is nearly as much of a favor
ite. Shika, wnich means "dear," is one
of the smallest and most valuable of her \
extremely aristocratic family. She seems ;
well aware that she is a dog "of high de
gree" and holds her comical little wrin
kled nose high in air accordingly, though
she is susceptible to flattery and graciously
condescending in her manners.

Whenever the strains of this one melody
fall Opon his ear he sits down and lifting
his muzzle heavenward howls with all his
small might, but no other selection wakes
h re-ponsive chord within his breast.
This fact in his puppy head was the means
of restoring him to home and friend?.
Having been lost or stolen he was, after
more tnan a month's absence, brought to
his owners for identification, but he had
changed so much that they were unable
to positively claim him. After puzzling
for a time the doctor played several musi

effect was immediate and the identifica

Irish Duke, R. B. Taylor's fine IriÂ«h
water spaniel, is as great a pet at home as

When given to Mr. Taylor a year ago he
was stigmatized a.Â« "vicious and danger
ous," out as his new owner's family made
a friend and companion of him, instead of
rr-lejnling him to the kennels, they soon
won his heart completely. He-is still un
social with strangers, iiowever, and is
almost insanely jealous of Sancho, his
master's famous marsh dog. who returns
the feeling with interest. Sancho is a
most gentle and affectionate creature, who
wears his honors modestly and makes
friends wherever he goes. The two dogs
rarely quarrel, but detest each other
thoroughly. Peggy, a seven-month-old
puppy of Duke's and an infant prodigy in
her way, acts as peace-mater, for, oddly
enough, they are always civil to each
other in her company, and take a mutual
pleasure in watching her gambols and
submitting to her youthful caprices.
Mrs. Homer King's Captain Jinks is a

Miss Ina I). Coolbrith, the poet, though
credited with the ownership of several
dozen cats, in reality owns but two, both j
wonders of feline pulchritude. Calla.who i
has reached the extremely advanced age,
for a cat, of "sweet sixteen," is a pure
blooded Angora. Her coat, which is as
soft and hue and white as dandelion
down, is four inches long on her back and
s lie?, and her tail is a marvel of plumy
beauty. She has a remarkably pretty
kittenish face, with very larga eyes, a
short nose and the small round ears of
her aristocratic race. Originally from the
famous Johnson collection, shÂ»i was given
to Miss Coolbrith by Mrs. J. H. Boalt
twelve years since, and has from the first
evinced toward her gentle mistress the
most warm and devoted affection. Calmly
dignified in manner, oainty in her ways
and discriminating in her friendships â a
veritable "lady cat" in every wayâ Calla
has yet one fault: she is jealous, and of
her own son. A caress bestowed upon
Beauty in her presence renders her
wretched. Though sue is unselfishly
willing to share food and cushion with
him, she openly resents any special
kindness shown him by her human
friend?. Beauty, a "kitten" still, despite
his ten years of existence, is, like
most half-breed Angoras, extremely
deaf. He is very large, has a
close white fur and more than his share
of masculine vanity, since he delights in
presenting himself for inspection when
ever a stranger is within Miss Coolbrith's
hospitable gates, with an air of self-sat
isfaction which is delightfully abmrd. If
the expected praise be not forthcoming
his expression of chagrin is as UDmistak
able as it is laughable. Miss Coolbrith's
only other pet is a canary, remarkable
both for his sweet singing and retentive
memory. Over a year ago his mate died,
and a lady, of whom he had formerly been
very fond, removed her body from the
cace and carried it away. From that time
Sweetheart has shown the greatest ani
mosity toward his whilom friend and re
fuses to be placated. Amiability itsell
toward all his other acquaintances this
pinch of yellow feathers manifests actual
hatred toward this one person. If she
speaks to him he replies with shrill cries
of rage, and if she approaches him he
beats himself against the wires and pecks
at her in a paroxysm of furious anjer.
He evidently accused her of having made
a*vay with his companion and has neither
forgiven nor forgotten the fact.

; has the good fortune to belong to Mrs. I.
8. Dickinson (Hester A. Benedict), and has
j known neither a care nor a sorrow during
his twelve years of life. He wears a silver
collar, sits in a high chair at the table
when no guests are present, waits for grace
and then eats his food from his special
china plate with daintiness and decorum.
He hates only one person in the world,
and that is a harmless and necessary den

One of the most accomplished parrots

Mrs. M. J. Scorffy, and owes his education
entirely to her. He wa3 brought from
Panama iour years ago, when a mere
nestling, and ha; from the first shown re
markable aptitude and intelligence. He
repeats almost everything he hears, and
seems to really understand the meaning of
the many words in his vocabulary, as heap
plies them to circumstances and occasions
in a way which is fairly startling to persons
accustomed to parrots that speak only by
rote. Besides possessing all the usual
accomplishments of his kind this wonder
lul bird spells his own name, "Romeo,"
also "cat" and "dog" and other simple
words, and sets right any one who spells
them incorrectly. He knows all his
friends by name and welcomes them
cordially when they call upon him,
while he revives strangers with dignified
affability. While Romeo's conversational
and imitative powers are actually phe
nomenal his musical achievements are
almost unbelievable, as he sings the air
and words of at least a dozen song?.
"Polly Hopkins," "Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,"
"Dry Your EyÂ«s," "Don't Cry in Van,"
"Come Love, Come," "Little Brown Jug,"
"You Shan't Play in My Yard," "The

are some of the gems of 1m repertoire, and

of clean gravel. Occasionally he is given
a nut, a lump of sugar and a red pepper
pod, but water and fruit are absolutely in

and has his feet manicured regularly, and
is as happy, good-tampered and healthy

There was once a little home in my city,
around whose humble hearthstone there
centered every comfort, joy and happiness
this life can give.
The breadwinner of this sacred circle
was a man whose genial, generous and

He was a magnificent specimen of young

flowers that blossomed from their -love
were two little buds of humanity, a girl
and a boy.
The slightest cloud had never shown
itseif above the horizon of their happi
ness, until one day it came in the shape of
a political nomination for office.
The first ventnre was a success, so far
as the achievement of a victory went, but
so far as it concerned the peace and com
fort of that little home, and its contents,
it was a failure from the iirst.
Uncertain coming took the place of punc

home enjoyment and discipline, unreason
able demands by unreasonable people at
unreasonable hours turned the tide at the

should realize the first stage of her sorrow

stant calls upon her tolerance, together
with another term of office to seek, turned
anxiety into dread. And when, as a cli

loss of home, sorrow had filled the cup to its
brim, and the last stage was reached, when
dread darkened into despair â and such

Life's compensation, ofter all, estab
lishes an average that is fair.
The doleful story just related is offset by
another one, for on the opposite side of
the street is the home of a man wlio
started life where the other ended, in a
saloon, and yet to-day stands respected,
honored, reve-ed in his community and
among his fellow-men.
From a wretched doggery on the water
front, he has persevered, worked, studied
and employed politics to the end which
has given him respectability, wealth and
renown.
On his way up he met the other going
down, both on the same path, but going in
different directions: one to fame and for
tune, the other to infamy and misfortune.
Where politics elevated the one it ruined
the other; to one it brought sobriety, to
the other intemperance; to the one it in
spired an. ambition to a higher life, the
other it dragged down to a lower; to one
political life meant a healthier growth, to
the other it was poisonous; to one a bless
in?, to the other a curse. What to the
wife and children of one was a shipwreck
at sea, to the wife and children of the
other was a voyage of profit to a new and
bounteous clime. Thus in politics as in
everything else in this life do we find com
pensations well averaged.

Idyls of Forests and Fieldsâ Qlorious Jramps ir\ the Hillsâ Birds
Returning to JKeir Last Year's Nests
MaOW that the days are growing
X balmy and springlike, the influx
3 of Sunday trampers into the hills
has begun. lam sure it is a higl:
human impulse, this one that sends
men and women natureward when the
growths of field and stream and forest are
young and tender. It is a pait of that
inherent wisdom of the race that warns
us to lift up our eyes to the hill?. A good
part of our human strength comes thence.
A eood part of human life lies there.
If it be not true that the same life that
; ih in us is also, in kind, throughout all
1 nature, then I see no reason why human
beings should take any interest in nature
or feel any sympathy with her processes.
The ancient wise one is, indeed, for our
use, for our help ana upbuilding, only it
behooves us humans to learn, ere we visit
her, the difference between use and appro
priation. The things of nature are not
ours. They are only for us. That which
we can use we may take, freely, but
nature' 3 anathema is upon those imper
fectly humanized beings who cannot use,
who can only appropriate and vandalize
that which they cannot understand, to
which their finer perception is blind and
deiif and, having nothing to express,
dumb.
Something of this sort passed through
my mind as, climbing the mountain in
the wake of a party of tramp?rs â young
wen and maidens â I came upon not one
or two but five demolished birds' nests,
wantonly torn from their anchorage and
left by the pathway. Fortunately, they
were all last year's nests, though I ques
tion if the human depredators knew it,
and I knew that no one of the wrecks
represented some feathered Rachel mourn
ing, comfortless; but none the less I felt
indignant at the unnecessary vandalism.
It would bs a comparatively easy mat
ter to depopulate our woods of their
feathered denizens. The birds are the
most intelligent of all the woodland
creatures, not because of their naturally
greater brain endowment, but because
there are no other creatures subject to so
many dangers, and the constant presence
of peril has made them wary and clever.
These happy, singing, winged morsels of

anxiety. The building of a nest is under
taken in questioning and with grave con
sideration. The location must be sheltered
from rude winds tbat might tear it down
or toss the nest's infant occupants out.
The wee cradle must be hidden from the
sharp eyes of climbing snakes. It must
be sheltered from the depredations of the
chattering, egg-loving squirrels and the
attacks of feathered cannibals, and to our
shame, be it said, it must be placed safely
out of reach of human beings, who, en
dowed beyoml all other created things
with the power to appreciate and enjoy
all for which the birds stand, are the
most dangerous foes the little creatures
know. It is one of the rarest occurrences
in nature when a bird dies a natural
death, yet they perish annually by hun
dreds of thousands.
To take a last year's bird's nest for pur
poses of study is not an unpardonable
thing, provided you are sure the nest is
not one o' birds whose habit it is to re
turn each year to their old home. There
are birds who do this season alter season,
and whether one has any more right
to such a nest than he has to the dwelling
of his next-door neighbors, who have
taken a winter's flitting, is a question each
must settle for himself.
More birds return to their last season's
nests than wo have any idea of. I know a
great tree beside a jolly little stream that
bears on one down-drooping branch an
oriole's nest that has been occupied for
three seasons by what appear to be the
same two birds. There is something im
pressivs in the thought of the loyal little
pair who traverse the trackless sky path
year after year from their winter haunts
to seek this low-swung home, rear their
young brood and disappear again for an
other season. The nest, too, is a wonder
ful sort of thing. I have studied it again
and again, lying on the bank with my
field glass leveled at it. The canny build
ers have wound a long cord deftly about
several small drooping branches, so as to
form a sort of rough basket, and in and
out of the meshes thus formed they have
woven horsehair, cotton and feathers un
til the whole forms a strong, light, well
ventilated swinging cradle, where a fairy
child might rock and slumber in perfect
security.
One of the nests I found by the wayside
is that of the brown towhee, one of our
commonest California birds. The towhee
stays with us the year through and is gen
erally called the ground robin. He is a
plain, brown, monkish-looking bird with
a touch of pale red on breast and belly.
You catch a glimpse of this as he flits his
lonp, restless tail and it serves to identify
the bird. He is not gifted in song, but
when excited or angry gives vent to a
sharp, cat-like cry that has won for him
the name of "the Western catbird." He
can sing, however, when he is in love and
on wooing bent. All birds sing then, and
he may also be heard just before a rain
storm warbling very softly among the
bushes. Plain though his coat, the to
whee is a sleek, neat little feilow, with a
particularly clever-lookine, pretty head.
One of the most winsome birds of our

winter season is the little Oregon junco,
who corresponds to the snowbird of thÂ«
North and the East. With the exception
of the titmouse I know no bird, not even
the fearless little goidfincn, who is so
frank and friendly. I have had one actu
ally pick up seeds from between my feet
as I sat upon the ground, thrilling all
through with delight at the near approach
of the trusting morsel in feathers. They
are very pretty birds, with shining black
heads and necks, backs of olivaceous
brown, and ashy breasts, just shading to
pink along the sides. Tne two outer
feathers each side of the tail are white
and show conspicuously as the bird flies,
making a capital identilication mark.
They have, also, stout, knowing-looking
little yellow bills. The junco does not
nest with us, but leaves late in February
for the colder mountain regions.
I saw a group of them on a bare swamp
willow the other day, going through a se
ries of maneuvers that would have done
credit to a militia company. First the
whole corps, a score or more, after what
seemed like a game of follow-the-leader,
lined up on one branch of the willow,
while on a twig before them perched a
single bird, evidently a full-grown male,
tor he was larger than the others, and
more distinctly plumaged. There was a
great preening of feathers, a stretching of
wings and a nibbing of breasts and then,
presto, as if at some preconcerted signal,
every bird suddenly left the perch,
wheeled into line and the entire company
flew in a perfect inverted V across the
field. There was not a single straggler.
They rose in air as one bird and formed
without an instant's hesitation. Appar
ently they were practicing for longer
flight.
The joyous little goldfinch, called here
abouts the California canary, is alread}'
with us. At least the male birds are here,
although they have not yet got their new
spring suits. They will have them, how
ever, before the ladies arrive, and then
will begin one of the sweetest of the re
curring idyls of springtime. The wild
canary is a fascinating little lover, so ar
dent, so tender, so eager to win his lady' 3
smiles, which she, cunning one, appa
rently bestows not lightly. He must sing
to her long and sweetly his wild, charm
ing, canary-like song. He must invite her
consideration of eligible nesting sites, of
which he has probably been making a
study during his days of bachelor wait
ing. If none of these avail he will sit half
an hour at the time a disconsolate, hud
dled little bunch, pathetically posed in
plain sight of the scornful fair one, con
sidering what His next move shall be.
Then, a3 if pulling himself together
with a warning injunction against faint
heartedness, he will begin all over and go
through his little programme with re
newed vivacity and tenderness. If, how
ever, his wooing is in vain and the cap
tious little hen goes off, as she sometimes
will, with a final rejecting flirt of the tail,
it has never seemed to me that the feath
ered wooer took his defeat very seriously
to heart. Birds are by nature philosophers,
apparently, and too thoroughly settled
in the order of their lives not to be easily
consoled.
There is a great satisfaction in knowing
the identity of the birds one meets during
a day's ramble; in calling by name the
blossoms that greet one in field and can
yon, or in recognizing the little creeping
things that quick eyes see on every side.
Any one who raises his eyes in the woods
from the barrels of his gun may see the
down - drooping redwoods and know
they are not oaks, or detect the difference
between the twisted manzanita and little
robin - run - the -hedge, with its clinging
tendrils, but it this is the extent of his
woodcraft he is poor indeed. To see the
first small swelling of bare brown stems,
before the leaf buds break the bark; to
note, with no pang of regret, the swift
leaps of the fleeing rabbit across the open ;
to name the birds, without a gun, and to
find excuse for loitering beneath every
tree, beside every moss-grown rock, are
the real delights of seeing nature in her
haunts.
I came recently with a party of tramp
ersto an open space among the chaparral
on the crest of a chain of foothills. The
leader of the party motioned silence and
stood spellbound with parted lips anil
smiling, delighted eyes, gazing at a flock
of quail quietly making their way through
the grass. There must have been forty of
the alert, beautiful birds, plump and shin
in?, with glossy feathers stirring in tha
breeze and crested heads proudly, fear
lessly held high.
"Did you ever see anything so beauti
ful?" whispered their discoverer. But the
Nimrod of the party wrung his gunles3
hands and groaned: "What a shot 1 oh,
what a shot !"

Washington's Weddirvg Day.
When the heart of a nation is torn and riven,
When the prayers of a people in one stream
roll,
Out from the silence an answer is given-
Then cometh the Leader, the masterful soul.
Let the faith of the world like a star be steady;
Let no man question God's might and power ;
For heroes arise when their work is ready,
And patriots come at the needed hour.
So Washington came. While a king derided,
And wise men sneered, and the old world
laughed,
He stood at the helm and safely guided
Through blood-red billows fair freedom's
craft.
Oh, frail was the bark, and the wild waves
bruised her;
The mad sea lashed her in cruel sport;
But strong was the heart and the hand that
cruised her
Past rocky reefs to the peaceful port.
The world hears much of the warlike doings
Of famous heroes on fields of strife,
But why not sing of their lovings and woi>
ings
Since love is the mightiest force in life?
The day of his birth no man remembers;
Tne day of his death no man can say;
But the heart of a man shall burn to embers
Before he forgets his wedding day.
He who is boldest where cannons thunder
Is soonest to soften at woman's charms.
And the tenderest hearts hide olttimes under
The brawny bosom that carry arms.
And he who held as a priceless treasure
The freedom wrenched from a tyrant's hand
We find was slave of a woman's pleasure
And wearing her felters at love's command.
We need but look and we see them standing
Like a picture flung out by the vitascope.
The queenly bride, and the groom command
ing,
Both with the dower of youth and hope.
My lady is gowned in stately fashion;
My lord has buckles at toe and knee;
Their hearts are warm with the fire of pas
sion,
As the hearts of a bride and groom should
be.
The vows are given, the service is over;
There's the clank of a sword as it swings
aside,
While the powdered head of tli3 CMirtly lover
Bends low and he kisses his now-made bride.
Ah! long ago was tnat famous marriage,
Yet we see tne groom in iris tout ot blue,
As he moves away with a soldierly carriage,
And we catch a glimpse ol my lady's shoe.
Like the last grand note of a song that is
ended,
Is a gifted man. As the record runs.
The race oi our hero has not descendedâ
Great souls give deeds to the worM, not sont.
He stands fot himself. Or father or mother
Or son or daughter or pedigree,
What were they all? It is he, no other,
Washington, Washington, whom we see.
Yes, one other; we sec beside him
The love-crowned queen of his manly heart.
She who ever could lead and guide him
With a woman's tact and with Cupid's art.
The one sweet clause in life's sad story
Is love. Ah, my lord, and my lady. I knovr
You found it better than all jour glory-
Could you speak through space, you would

A Woman's Whist League.
San Francisco was the first City in the United
States to admit women into their wbistclubs.
It was also the firsi City in the United States
to Ctfcally demonstrate the fact that
women could play whist as well, if not better, !
than men.
The first club that wts admitted into the
American Whist League with lady members j
came from this City. To-day we can select!
twenty-five or fifty ladies in this City
and Oakland that can defeat the same
number of men, and give them the whole
State to select from. If the time has now
come for the formation of a woman's league
it will have our hearty indorsement, and no
doubt the help of ail whist clubs on the Pacific j
Coast Eugene B. Elliott, whom the whist '
world looks upon as the lather and founder of i
The American Whist League, writes on the j
subject as follows:
Milwaukee. Wis., Dec. 29, 1896.
Mrs. Emma D. Andrew*, 1113 Spruce Street,
Philadelphia, Pa.â jiy Dear Madam: It gives
me sincere pleasure to learn that cue women I
cf America are about organizing a whist '
league similar in its features to the one insti- I
tuted here six years ago. for I feel that such en j
association is the logical and fitting consum- j
mation of the work then begun. There are j
many reasons why a woman's league should
be organized, while there is little that can be
urged against it, and nothing, in ray opinion, I
that will stand the test of close scrutiny. Let i
me assure you, therefore, of my sincere and '
cordial sympathy, and, so far as my influence j
may extend, of my support
1 have always regarded whist as something
far greater than a sport or pastime, for its in
herent characteristics are such that it is capa- ;
ble of becoming a valuable instrument for the â 
development of our highest mental faculties,
and is therefore to the mentality of our people I
what physical athletics are to their muscles;
an amusement whose /unction is to develop â 
our power to think logically and correctly, j
should neither be ridiculed nor ignored, nor '
should it ever be regarded as standing upon ;
the same level as an ordinary pastime.
I have met many fine wnist-players, but j
I do not recall the name qf one who is not a '
man of high repute" in his chosen avocation, i
But aside from th is noble characteristic, which !
of itself would be sufficient to commend it to '
favorable consideration, whist Is pre-eminently i
entitled to our fuvor in that it is essentially' a i
home amusement, and as such is not restricted
to either sex. . Whatever, will keep our boys et i
home, interest them there, brine them under I
the sweet and ennobling influence of mother I
end sister, is of the utmost importance, and to j
this end it is highly gratifying to know that j
the â women of America are willing to lend i
their powerful aid. I hail, therefore, the an- I
nouncement of your organization with sincere
pleasure, and trust that no obstacle will Inter
vene to prevent complete success.
The selection of Put-in-Bay at the time of
the league meeting there next July seems to
me to be very fortunate. I hope to have the j
pleasure of meeting you and your associates |
there at that time, and beg leave to repeat my
assurance that if 1 can be of any assistance in
aiding you in any way. I will be most loyally
at your command. Believe me, very respect

Score: North and South 13, East and West 0.
Trick 2. The play of South is fine and is the
key to the hand. North's play of eight marks
him with jack or no move, and if the latter
should prove to be the case he can lose noth
ing by leading low, as East must then have
five trumps, and will certainly make two of
them.
Trick 3. It is plainly the duly of North to
underlead in this case, as he will probably
Â«in by so doing, even snould his partner fail
to win the first trick.
Tricks 4to 13. South can easily draw the
remaining trumps, put his partner in with a
spade and reap the reward of his good play.
In trick ten North merely shows that he has
counted his partner's hand correctly by lead
ing the three from jack, three remaining.
Such deals ana whist play should never be lost
sight olâ even lor expert players.

"Whist of Jo-Day," Fifth Edition.
"Whist of To-Day," when it came from the
press for the first time about eighteen months
ago, was looked upon by some writers as sort
of a free-lance. Its author, Milton C. Work,
had the courage of his convictions. He came
out and gave to the whist-players something
new to think of. We were one of tho first to
write the author just what we thought of it
We didu't wait to get In with the procession
that was afterward formed to sing the praises
for the new work. We "spoke right out in
meetin 1 ,' 1 and our opinion is just the same to
day. Five editions in eighteen months is a
record to be proud oi. Mr. Work says: "In
order that the reader may be able to distin
guish the old from the new it has seemed ad
visable to place all the new suggestions in an
appendix by themselves, calling it Appendix
C." The subjects that he has introduced are:
Tiie ace, queen, echo in tramps holding four
exactly, Â«Â»h partner's lead; call through
honor; keeping the lowest card; covering
ton with ace, from lend of ten from Q. J, 10,
etc.; playing down; the sliorlrsuit game, and
ending up with a long compilation of p.ain
suit leads in order of merit. This table oi
leads is worth the price of a dozen books.
The book is published by Dreka of Phila
delphia and sold for $1 a copy.

What notes should there bo upon dummy
play*,
Where each card as it falls speaks its part?
The solution must lose by a paraphrnse,
And t hus science pay tribute to art.
Just 1 ist to the silent eloquence
Of the order of play, gone lefore,
And mark the first principle â good horse
sense â
The problem admits nothing more.
Position's the first thing that needs reeard,
The same as in actual whist,
Then make the opponents their suits discard.
Of the matter these things are the gist.
When a problem is deep, a solution nice,
No prize does the true whister need;
The love of the game will at all times suffice,
And supplant the desires of greed.
When athletes prepare for a great contest.
They wrestle aud race with machines;
So may students of whist, with an equal zest,
Find dummy an excellent means.

by George L. Bunn of St, Paul.
'â¢Mr. Bunn needs no introduction to the
whist-players of the American Whist League.
He is a league director, has played at most of
the league tournaments, is one of the commit
tee of seven experts to determine the best
method of play; his team won the champion
ship iv 1893, and he has held the Hamilton
trophy.
"Whist-players are to be congratulated that
Mr. Bunn has consented to appear in print.
His articles are lull of matter of interest and
helpful to all lovers and students of the noble
game. His analyses of and comments upon
hands played are very complete and clear.
"He gives the latest and best thought on
the game, and presents the arguments on
both sides with unusual clearness and fair
ness. His own judement of play is recognized
as the best, being based upon very careful
j thought, thorough study and large experi
j ence." .

Eastern Metropolis
Â§fjS rare as pink diamonds are the
iLtal-V visiting Californians in Gotham.
l i \\ : 7 Everybody knows that each year
aada to the list of resident ones, LuMt
takes no time to chronicle their names and
social doings. After that has been accom
plished divers times we just sit down and
bite onr thumbs and cultivate a nice little
case of homesickness.
Why don't a band of dear old California
friends form a big excursion party and
come over here to experience the unique
pleasure of sleighing in real snow, skating
on real out-of-'*oors ice and playing at
fencing with long slender icicles that look
like the crystal pendants from some mas-
Bive chandelier? It isn't one-half as bad
as folks imagine.
Toe Eastern weather is undeniably in
vigorating and healthful, especially to
those who have lived for uninterrupted
years in such a mild and gentle climate as
ihat of dear California, with its sifted
sunshine, its never-fading wealth of
flowers and its inexhaustible plenty of
everything.
Change, however, is the zest of life. If
one can always manage to mix the cood a
trifle with a tiny speck of badnes3, with
out doubt the mixer will find a delightful
â .on of warmth creeping into the
lA orners and crevices of his soul.
\ peat, come over here for a few weeks'
change, you California home-bodies! Oh,
never lear, you will be glad enough to
hustle home again very soon, 1 am con
fident.
Twenty-ti vt years ago lower Fifth avenue
was the swellest section of New York:. To
day st is almost deserted by the rich and
mighty. True, there are many old and
respectable families connected with New
York's early history who still live down
near Washington square, and dote on re
calling the "olden golden glory of days
gone by." The Astors, Van Rensselaers,
Vanderbilts, Stuyvesants and all the rest
of the old timers have built magnificent
homes way uptown, between tne Fiftieth
and Eightieth streets.
At the Berkeley, on Fifth avenue and
Ninth street, Mrs. Charles WeDb Howard
is residing. She has beer, there several
months, doing very little entertaining,
but enjoying the few friends who have
helped to make her stay in New York
pleasant.
Mr. and Mrs. Sliafter Howard have been
with her at the Berkeley up to two weeks
ago. when they went to visit friends living
on East Seventy-sixth street.
Karl Howard returned to Harvard last
week. Mrs. Howard anticipates returning
to California the first part of February.
Charles E. Fredericks hurried into the
c^y on Tuesday to attend the sickbed of
JÂ«i father, who is seriously ill uptown.
>^ Fredericks is a guest at the Hoffman
llou-o.
W. F. and Mrs. Cerdes are stopping at
a Broadway hotel.
F. D. Fraser of San Francisco arrived
on Wednesday, and is putting up at the
old stand-by, the Metropolitan.
On Tuesday night the hotel men held
their annual banquet at Delmonico's. It
was a brilliant occasion and the guests
were unanimous in their praise of the
whole affair. The 400 gue3ts (it was a
stag dinner) were served with such won
derful promptness and detail course after
course, and with appropriate wines, that
the most up-to-date bonifaces and club
men opened their eyes in astonished ad
miration.
Apropo?, a pretty little story goes with
this banquet.
James Breslin, the president of the Ho
tel Association of New York, and proprie
tor of the Gilsey House, is one of the big
gest-hearted and most popular men in
town, everybody agrees on that Bcore;
therefore when he was consulted on the
subject of where the annual banquet
should be given, and the luxurious Wal
dorf was mentioned as the most appro
priate place, Mr. Breslin gently but firmly
gave his opinion that, as the annual din
ner had for years been given at Delmoni
co's, he could not see why this year should
not find them stili true to the old place.
Beside, this is Delmonico's last year on
Fifth avenue and Twenty-sixth street,
and as business for liim has not been of
the nourishing kind lately a grand re
nnion of old friends in his banquet-hall
would add much to his happiness as a
caterer and good fellow. Mr. Breslin car
ried the day, and Charlie Delmonico
gave the dear old hotel-boys and their
friends a feast which they will always re
member with a glow of pleasure.
"You see," said one of the guests the
next day, "we not only ate good things,
but we heard splendid toasts, witty and
logical, thus proving that the majority of
heads hold healthy brains and do not
serve as a mere rendezvous for hair."
It was a quaint way of putting it, but
then when I thought of the disgraceful
Seeley banquet at Sherry's I smothered
the laugh on my lips and concluded my
friend had been uttering words of wisdom.
Crossing the river on the Courtland-street
ferry the other evenine were Dr. and Mrs.
Charles A. Wayland of San Jose, looking
as well and hapoy as two little robins on
a spring day. Dr. Wayland is busy at
tending lectures and important clinics,
preparatory to resuming his successful
practice in San Jose when he returns this
spring. Mrs. Wayland (nee Rucker) is in
excellent health and spirits and declares
that New York weather agrees with her.
Bob Davis, the gifted and popular
brother of the witty and original Sam
Davis, is making things hum in liis line of
work here. "Bob" was long connected
with several papers in fan Francisco, ana
now as a metropolitan writer for the New
York Journal and several magazines he
is making rapid headway. Entre nous, I
heard a couple of little birds whispering
that before many new moons the genial
Bob will take unto himself a wife. She is
a beautiful brunette, and the little birds
intimated that she was a young widow.
Of course I may not have the story correct
in detail, but little birds will chirp, you

Madge Morris-Wagner has written a

W. E. Dennison, the well-known en

reached here on New Year's day, but
hastened away to Boston, where he passed
several days most profitably inspecting
the city street-cleaning department and
investigating the important question re
garding the removal and disposal of the
city's refuse.
Mr. Dennison was treated right royally
when he returned to New York. Cap
tain Warm?, the president of th<* Street
cleaning Department of this city, put a
half-dozen experienced men at his com
mand, and Mr. Dennison had the splen
did opportunity of studying the inside
workings of New Y'ork's magnificent
street-cleaning system.
Mr. Dennison will return to his offices
in San Francisco with very valuable
knowledge concerning the most impor
tant question in a city's governmentâ the
paving and cleaning of streets and the
successful removal of offensive debris.
During his absence from California,
amounting to two months, Mr. Dennison
has tnoroughly investigated the city gov

Review of Mines and
Mining in California.
5-JFSLHE legislation which the officers and
k-I'*o committees of which the officers and
Bp committees of the Miners' Associa
jÂ£f $ tion are now seeking at Sacramento
and at Washington is the thing that is
just now enlisting the immediate and
active interest of the men at the front of
mining affairs. Never before has the
securing of such extensive and important
mining legislation been attempted, and the
industry is vitally concerned with the at
tempt. Seldom has so strong and intelli
gent an effort been made to secure laws in
the interest of anything and, fortunately
for the miners, seldom has a campaign for
important legislation in the interest of
any class met with so little opposition.
The present session of the Legislature is
notable for the fact that it is the first
one for a generation in which the
bitterness of the old debris and
anti-debris fight has not figured. It is
like the first National campaign which
came along and left out the bloody shirt
in recognition of the fact that the war was
over. At Sacramento the miners ana the
valley people arc generously and sensibly
joining hands with a disposition to unite
and do something for the common wel
fare. Thus, so far, the miners have en
countered no opposition at Sacramento,
and with Governor Budd heartily in favor
of most of their measures there is a
promise that the miners will get what
they ask.
The most important thing which the
miners seek is the enactment of what may
be termed a State mining code containing
laws to promote the convenience and
protection alike of prospectors, mine
workers and mine-owners. As California
stands alone among the mining Stares in
having never enacted such a badly needed
code, and as the proposition is universally
approved by the miners and affects no
body else, the bill will likely pass about
as approved by the executive committee of
the Miners' Association. No opposition
has appeared to the request for the repeal
of certain stray obnoxious statutes.
The second matter of importance is
the reappropriation of the unused $250,000
appropriated lout years ago on condition
that the United States expend a like sum.
The Government has begun the expendi
ture of thisamount, but a doubt about the
technical availability of the State appro
priation and a necessity for broadening its
purposes to conform to those or the Con
gressional appropriation make a new bill
necessary. As the money lies in the
treasury the appropriation involves no
new burden on the State.
As the miners are ready to support ths
allied measure to expend $300,000 in the
deepening of the Sacramento, there i 3 a
promise that when the Lecislature ad
journs there will be $550,000 avail
able for expenditure on the Sac
ramento and its tributaries in a way
that will add millions to the value and
production of both the mineral and agri
cultural lands of the Sacramento Valley.
The other matter of importance in
which the miners are interested is that of
a liberal appropriation for the support of
the State Mining Bureau. There is some
serious discussion about this, especially
because Governor Budd has recommended
that the bureau be abolished and its work
turned over to the State University. The
miners are generally ready to vigorously
champion the Mining Bureau, and the
friends of the university, who are seeking
a lioeral appropriation, are letting the
discussion alone. The miners assert that
the Mining Bureau is something which
performs its fuiictions,|and is invaluable to
the mining industry.
Its function is mainly to supply needed
information to mining men, a.nd with
the present revival of mining activity the
demand for information is far greater now
than for many years. Thfl College of
Mines of 4 .he university is all right,
the average miner says, but the mining
man generally wants practical informa
tion about where, what, who and how,
and not science, and such practical
information would not be bo well
supplied by purely college men. It is in
sisted that the place for the Mining
Bureau is the City and the most conve
nient location in it. The miners, how
ever, are not much afraid that the Mining
Bureau will be abolished this year.
The Mining Bureau is certainly sup
plying information to a great many people.
Over 100 letters are received daily asking
for publications or information of every
conceivable sort. Dozens visit the library
every day to learn all sorts of things,
from how much bacon a green prospector
needs to the solution of some deeply
scientinc mining problem. Many more
visit the museum, and since the first of
the year over 2500 copies of tb.o last
report have been called for in person or
by letter. It may interest some people,
by the way, to know that there is a grt-at
and increasing demand for copies of old
reports of the State Mineralogist. Only
copies of the tenth and twelfth re
ports can now be supplied by the
bureau, in addition to the one
just issued, the thirteenth. While
thousands of the other reports were dis
tributed free it is very difficult to get hold
of a copy, and many mining men are
searching for them. The second-hand
book-dealers understand their value and
when they get them charge from $1 to $5
for them, according to the year.
The generally credited recent reports
that foreign capital, mainly that of Lon
don, is now especially turning to the
Pacific Coast in search of profitable
investment and acquiring a slight preju
dice against South Africa and Australia
is encouraging to the industry here and
will have a stimulating effect at home
whether the acceleration of foreign in
vestment becomes marked this year or
not. That foreign capital had largely
and eagerly turned to the gold fields oi
tue world and that agents of California
and other Pacific Coast gold-raining prop
erties could find moro ready ears in Lon
don Jhan ever before was well known be
fore this latest report of a disposition to
shun South Africa and Australia came
along, and this readiness to consider
Pacific Coast investments will remain and
grow for some time, for ttiere is a con
gestion of capital seeking profitable in
vestment at a time when there is a more
general turning to gold-mining than ever
before in the world's history.
There is, However, much to justify thesa
reports of mining men returning from
London, and to justify the expectation
that it is what will occur. The rich South
Alrican fields, though they will yield im
mensely for years to come, show signs of
having reached about the limit of discov
ery and development, and hence to have
reached the maximum of their allure
ments. The Australian gold fields have
not yet reached this point, but the extent
to which Australian mines have been over
capitalized and rhe extent to which in
vestors have been bitten in them are
among things which make capitalists con
servative of investment there. The west
ern slope of North America is not only the
richest and most extensive gold-bearing
region of the world, but it is by far the
one having the greatest future possi
bilities in the way of development, and
while this is true ot the entire Pacific
Coast region it is especially true of Cali
fornia. This truth is recognized by the
best-informed men interested in gold
mining the world over, and tbat it will
result in an increasing flow of capital
thitherward deems self-evident.
A syndicate of Salt Lake capitalists is
going to make a determined effort to suc
cessfully develop and work the rebellious
ores of the Meadow Lake mines. There
will be used a smelting process in which
the fumes from the roasted ore will be
blown through a flu* extending 350 feet
on a downward incline to the chimney.
In this passage the fumes are precpitated,
and the antimony and arsenic in the ores
are deposited at different points and
saved.
The suspension bridge across Kl amain
River, below Thompson Creek, for sup
porung the pipe bein? laid to furnish
water for the Nannette B placer mine will
be completed in a few days. The water
suppiy comes from Thompson Creek In a
ditch three miles long, and is then piped
across the river. As soon as the piped
water is ready to start the giants a larger
force of men will be pat on in order to
work the ground along the river on an
extensive scale. This claim is under the
control of Dr. 0. H. Simonds, one of the
principal owners. â Yreka Journal.
The development of the gold resources
of the Pacific Coast north of the United
States boundary seems to have just fairly
begun. Recent expert reports suggest the
probability of rich and extensive quartz
deposits in Alaska awaiting discovery and
development and this year promises the
exhibition of a rush of gold-seekers to
Alaska far greater than that of 1896, de
spite the Dad luck, hardships and failures
met by so many men last year. The de
velopment in British Columbia is just a
little ahead of that in Alaska, and British
capital is rapidly accelerating it. The gold
and silver production of British Columbia
was $500,000 in 1895, while in 1896 it rose,
according to present estimates, to $4,340,
--000. and newspaper talk is of $10,000,000 in
1897.
The Denver Weekly News reports a
large number of ricti strikes in the Cripple
Creek district since the first of the year,
and a rapid increase in the amount and
value of the ore being taKen out, with a
promise that the gold yield for 1897 will
much exceed that of 1896. During 1896
the Elkton mine produced aboui $450,000
worth of gold, and its output for 1897 is
fixed in advance at over $1,000,000. In
December the cross output was $100,000.
A recent shipment of ore from the Fannie
11 mine went over $500 a ton.
Anew mill is to be erected during the
coming summer at tbe Shroeder quartz
mine in Siskiyou County, which is one
of the most extensive mines in that
county. It is now b^ing worked in the
tenth level, 1200 feet below the surface.
The sales of Colorado mining stocks on
the Denver market for the week ending
January 13 aggregated 1,806,100 shares.
With the coming of the winter supply of
water hydraulic and otber placer mines
throughout the northern part of the State
are starting up for the season or increas
ing the scale of operation and activity
will continue until the water supply be
comes shor^ene.l in the summer.
A through ticket to Randsburg or Gar-
I lock can now be bought at points on the
) Southern Pacific lines, the railroad com
j pany having effected a traffic arragement
| with one of the stage lines. The Santa Fa
} is expected to follow suit.
The latest stnfce in the new Randsburg
j gold fields is reported to have occurred on
| the desert between Garlock and Mohave,
! where^a prospector ran into a ledge assay
j ing $600 a ton.
In the Rocky Bar drift mine in Nevada
County some exceedingly rich spots are
being found along the bedrock. From one
I depression three feet in diameter $638 in
. dust and nuggets was found and a hole as
big as a saucer yielded $263.
Anew ledge of rich quartz was found
last week in the Cadmus mine in Nevada
County.
The Salt Lake syndicate operating in
the Meadow Lake district has now bonded
nineteen mines, two more having been
secured this week at $10,000 each.
Tbe Spanish mine in Nevada County
has been shut down until March.
It is reported that a new strike of rich
gravel has been made in the Odin drift
mine in Nevada County, and that M.
Blaskower of San Francisco, the owner,
will resume operation of the mine at once.
The hydraulic mine at Gold Run, Ne
vada County, which ha 3 been bonded by
an English company, is now in full opera
tion.
The Corona Mining and Milling Com
pany is preparing to erect a forty-stamp
mill at its mines in the Tauquitz mining
district.
Dividing the Time.
When Wade Hampton was Governor of
South Carolina in 1878 he and Hueh S.
Thompson, who became Governor in 1882,
agreed to div.de the time at a certain big
"speakin 1 ," says the New York Press.
Each was to take half an hour. Hampton
led off and spoke for forty minutes,
whereupon Thompson protested warmly.
"We agreed to tp^ak thirty minutes
each, didn't we, 1 ' said the Governor,
naively.
"Yes, and yon took forty," replied the
aggrieved Thompson.
â¢ l vV ell, that's fair. The extra ten min
utes were applause," lau?hed Hampton,
and li is rival had to laut;h. too.

An Illinois barber wishe- a law impos

biil it is evidently intended to shave close.
The Government has been assured that
it will receive for its Hen on the Union Pa

â >,QOO, and that is good enough fur a

The Germans have a law ngainst stock
gambling and dealing in future*, but it is
said to work so badly that even the Kaiser
doesn't consider its violation as an insult
to his uniform.
As the amount which England found it
necessary to expend for her navy last year
was over $109,000,000 it is not strange tbat
her taxpayers are eager for arbitration
with Uncle Sam.
At the present time all the William -

still New York bravely makes a metro- !
politan show and tries to act as if it were
not a deserted village.
The legislators who stood up and ac
knowledged their share in the payroll scan
dal and took their medicine like men will
receive a degree of commendation from
the public, but they mustn't go wrong
again.
Judcinc: from report?, the resolution of
Senator Lodge demanding the abolition of
the Congressional .Record was a motion of
such unexpected suddenness that it made
all Washington oscillate like an earth
quake.
A great deal of useless comment has
been written on the fact that a majority of
the Kentucky delegation in Congress has
expressed disapprobation of the use of
wine in the White HouÂ«e. The Ken
tuckians should have been asked about
whisky.
A f'llow who professes to know declares
that most of the sardines con-umed
in thiscountry are caught on the coast of
Maine and are preserved in oil made of
coUon seed. From this statement it seems
the only genuine sardine in the case is the
consumer.
During the last four years Massachusetts
has expended $450,000 in exterminating
the gypÂ«y moth with a degree of success
which is amply demonstrated by the
report of the State entomologist, that the!
war will require $200,000 a year for the
next five years.
Chicago is always considered the city of J
rapid development in this country, while â 
Philadelphia is regarded as slow of
growth, but in the last year $24,819,700 j
was expended for buildings in Philnde!- !
phia. while Chicago put only $22,730,615
into new houses. It is ev.dentiy time to j
revise some of our popular ideas.
The Greater Republic of Central
America has beeun its diplomacy by ob
jecting to the Nicaragua canal bill be
cauÃÃ it places the control of the canal in
the hands of the United States Govern

Republic will be very eager to have the
power of Uncle Sam exerted there to pro
tect things.
As one way of solving the convict- labor
question Governor Tanner of Illinois has
recommended that the inmates of prisons
in that State be set to the work of making
schoolbooks. The proposal sounds hum
orous, but as the ycherae would break up
the schoolbook trust and furnish edifying
labor for the average prison intellect there
may be virtue in it.

rOBECLOSUBE BEGUN.
The. steps taken by Attorney-General
! Harmon to be^'in foreclosure proceedings
against the Union Pacific Railway Com
| pany are among the most encourazing
â¢ features of the situation. The fact that
I these steps have been taken encourages
: ! the belief that the proposed reference of
! the debts of the defaulting Pac tic roads
Ito a Government commission has no
i chance of being adopted at this session of
'â  Congress. We may expect, therefore, that
the will of the people will be carried out,
i and that the law will be enforced against
these powerful corporations in the same
way as it would be against a defaultine
! homesteader.
It is reported that before beginning any
' proceedings for foreclosure the Attorney-
I General received from the reorganization
! committee of the Union Pacific line a suar
| antee that if the mortgage were foreclosed
j and the property sold the Government
! would receive on it^ liens on the Union
i Pacific and Kansas Pacific roads, includ
j mc the sinking fund, not Jess than $45,
--i 754.000. This sum, therefore, will be the
i least tor which the Government claim will
j be sold, and, since the sale would be pob
' lie, there is a reasonable expectation that
higher bids will be made.
It mii't be borne in mind when consid
ering the financial side of the issue that
'' in any case the debts of the road will have
'to be paid by the people. Even if the re
! funding scheme had been carried out, and
the Government had been assured of the
j eventual repayment of every dollar due
from the defaulting road 3, it would still
! have b en the people who would hare
! had to make the payment. The directors
I of the road, who by its spoliation have
enriched themselves to the extent of many
millions of dollars, would not have paid
one cent. They would have fixed their
rates and fares at such prices as to enable
them to operate the road, pay the debt to
the G-vernnient and still further increase
their already enormous fortunes.
The people are not so much interested
in the amount of money which the Gov
ernment may receive from the road as
they are in the enforcement of the law ]
and the demonstration of the fact that
rich corporations can no moro evade their
responsibilities than can the obscurest
private citizen. Tney have desired to see
the law enforced mainly because it is the
law, and because they were unwilling that j
! this Government, which was powerful j
enough to put down a great rebellion and I
i< to-day strong enough to defy the world
in arms, should show itseli' lacking in
j strength, honesty and integrity to enforce i
i its laws against a giant combination of \
I corrupt millionaires.
The announcement of the beginning of
the forec:o.~r.re proceedings will be re
ceived everywhere with public approval.
It is satisfactory to note that at even a
forced sale the Government will not lose
much of its just claims. Still more satis
factory, however, is the evidence given
that the rich and powerful as well as the
poor must obey the law and fuiill their
obligations to the Government of the
United States.
LETTEfi-CAREIEES.
One of the few intances of business I
promptly transacted, by which the l
National Senate has redeemed itself from â 
ihe charge of making this a session of Idle ;
talk, was shown in the passage of the bill ;
providing for an increase in the salaries of I
the higher grades of letter-carriers. The !
bill having parsed the Senate now awaits
action in the House, and it is to be hoped :
that body will advance it on the calendar
and enact it into law before the session
closes. j i
The measure is a thoroughly meritorious
one and ha 3 been before Congress for I
several years. It provides for the creation j
of a fourth grade of carriers in first-class ! '
postoffices and of a third grade in second- j â¢
class offices; the salary in the first case to ! i
be $120) a year an.J in the second $1000 a i
year. It haa been favorably reported at ;
several sessions of Congress by committees ; '
of both houses, but until the recent action 1
of the Senate has never been acted on in
either of them.
The condition of the maii-carrier service
at present is this. An applicant for such !
a position must serve for four or five yrars i
as a substitute before he becomes a regu- j
iar carrier and during that time he earns i
but a bare subsistence. "When placed upon |
the payroll he receives for the fir=t year j
$000. In first-class postoffices he receives '
: for the second year $800 and for the third i
year $1000. To attain this salary it will be j
seen he has had to serve eight years, and i
there for the present his advancement is j
barred. The new bill will open for him
one grade higher and after nine years' j
! work lie will pet the proposed $1203 a year, j
; In second-cias* < iliee* the highest salary
â¢ for carriers i- $850, and the bill provides
j therefore for an increase for that class also.
When it is remembered that a hi:_'h
order of intelligence and fidelity and
capacity for long continued and arduous
work in all kinds of weather is required of j
mail-carriers it will be seen that the pro- |
j posed increase in their pay ia no more j
! than justice and the welfare of the service '
requires. A man who has sp>nt nine in- j
j dustrious years in a particular branch of |
the publi- service acquires therein a fund j
of information that is of groat value to j
the people, and it is but right that it
should be duly rewarded.
Tiie bill which has so often been recom
mende I to Congress has now a fair chance
of pas-age. It was passed by the Senate
j without a dissenting vote, and is now be
i fore the House, but unfortunately far
j down on the calendar. It is a measure !
which the leaders of tne Hous? can well
afford to advance to a position where it
i can be acted on before the session closes.
: Its consideration would not long delay
other business, since it would hardly be
j much opposed or lead to a lone debate.
I The House therefore would do well to
imitate the action of the Senate in the
matter and pass the bill at once.
THE SIBERIAN KAILBOAD.
Siberia has been so long associated in
our minds with severity and suffering that
! we regard it as the last place on earth to
| which to go for a pleasure trip. Barren,
inhospitable, dangerous, with a harsh
climate and a despotic Government, its
i reputation repels all travelers except those
1 of a more than ordinarily adventurous
| disposition. We now learn, however,
I from some American tourists lhat since
I the new railroad is being pushed far into
i the interior it is considered by the
j Russians a veritable El Dorado, and
! that people are pourinz into it with pur
i po-e to stay and settle.
The new rood, which is now operated to
Tomsk and will soon be completed to
Krasnoyarsk, the 30-called Athens of Si
beria, i?, we are told, far more comfortable
to travel over than the average road in
the United States. We are also informed
that firearms are a useless incumbrance.
The whole country, it is said, reminds the
American of our own Northwest, and they
talk there of coins out east just as we do
of KOine "out West."
According to reports a quarter of a mil- I
lion emigrants have gone to Siberia from
European Russia in the last few years,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 1897.
and scores are crossing tne line every
week. Only about a fifth of those who go
' fail to establish themselves sati-factoriiy.
| The railroad fare is very cheap, and one
j can go from Warsaw to Tomsk, a dis
tance of 3500 miies, for $23 second class
and $15 third class. The convenience
afforded the seconii-class passenger on this
new Russian road might be a good sug
j fce-tion to some of our American roads.
The backs of the seats are made so as to
lift up at nignt and thus one seat forms
two comfortable bunks for passengers to
sieen on without extra charge. Facilities
I for bathing the face and hands are also
provided for the second-class pasie tigers.
In Russia, as we are told by the Ameri
can tourists, the policy of the Government
is to encourage travel, and a large num
ber of passes are furnished. When the
road is finished as far as Yladivostock em
igrants will be carried the long distance
from Moscow to that point, 6000 miles, for
the small sum of $12.
There were a number of prisoners being
j carried out on the train in which the
â  Americans were, but they saw nothing of
i that cruelty or harshness which fiction
I has made us coapie with the thought of
sentences to Siberia; and there is some
peculiarity in the atmosphere and snch a
hardiness in the Russian peasantry that
i numbers of them, who were crowded out
| of s-helter and had to sleep in the open
j fields, seemed far more jolly and comfort
able than travelers who were huddled in
doors.
Judging from the interesting accounts
j received we must conclude that old Sibe
! ria must be wiped from the mind's map of
placed thereon.
NEWSPAFEB INfLUENCE.
Mr. Yerkes of Chicago is not a man
whose reputation adds any weight to iiis
words, but nevertheless he occasionally
says something of sufficient gravity to
need no adventitious aid to add to its sig
nificance. One of these sayings of self
contained weieht he has just expressed iv
the question, '"How can we expect out-
I siders to hold good opinions of our city
when our own newspapers do their utmost
to discredit it? '
The question is the more remarkable
coming from a Chicago man and referring
!to Chicago newspapers. In times past the
j press of that city could be accused of a!
--! most anything rather than of discrediting
aught that was said or done in Chicago.
The question, however, is pertinent to
more cities than the one to which it is ad
, die-s^J. For example, it is directly
; pertinent to the press and the City of San
j Francisco.
The judgment of outsiders concerning
i any community is more affected by the
j newspapers of that community than by
: anything else. It is mainly through the
! press that in our time a commun.t> makes
| itself known to the outer world. Its
culture, its morals, its politics, its busi
; ness and its aspirations are all supposed
i to be expressed or reflected in the news
papers which it supports and which it
sends abroad. If, therefore, these papers
dis-creiit the city, how can an outsider be
expected to hold a good opinion of it?
That eulogists of the press have at times
; unduly exaggerated its influence cannot
I be doubted, but nevertheless that influ
ence is much greater than is some-times
j supposed. Men's minds are largely col
: ored by whai they read every day. If
I they rise in the morning to read in tho
! paper at their breakfast table words of
; sanguine cheerfulness ami good import,
' they will go forth to their day's wort
bright and confluent, trusting i:i tnem
â  selves and willing to trust largely to
others. If, on the other hand, they are
net in the morning with sensational re
ports of crimes, scandals and fo.lit.-s, and
vith reiterated charges of corruption,
sronfdoing and dishonesty in every p^b
ic ollicial from highest to lowest, The
rffect cannot fail to be depressing. The
eader will begin to doubt the virtue of
iis fellow-citizen, the excellence of the
:ommunity in which he lives, and so far
Tom being ready to help public enter
arises will be inclined to regard each and
ill of them as a job whereby some cunning
â¢ascal is going to defraud the public.
The question ought to be asked every
lay iii Saa Francisco, how can we expect
jutsiders to hold good opinions of our
Lity when our own newspapers do their
jtmost to discredit it? There are papers
whicu live, move and have their being
inly to publish the vilest sensations which
;rime can furnish, or a faker concoct when
crime is not forthcoming. Such newspa
pers delight in magnifying every possible
;rror into an actual offense against honor
and morality. They are eager to seek out
rumors of quarrels in private families, or
differences of opinion among officials, and
?xaggerate them into scandals and charges
of dishonesty. Where such papers aie
supported the fame of the community is
rendered evil by the way in which it is
made known, and anything like a public
support of large municipal improvements
is prevented by exciting in the mind 3of
the peopie a belief that no one in office
can be trusted to undertake them.
To the question asiced by Mr. Yerkes
there should be added another: How can
wo expect outsiders to ho;d good opinions
of our City when we support newspapers
which discredit it? Sensational journal
ism cannot live by the slums alone,
though it may appeal to them lor support
and patronage. In a cettain sense every
subscriber to an indecent, libelous, malig
nant and disreputable journal is an of
fender against the weifira of the City.
Newspapers have influence wider than the
circle by which they are read. They affect
public opinion concerning the community,
and those which devote themselves to
spreading abroad evil reports are injurious
not only to its fame abroad, but to its ad
vancement at home.

THE RALLY
TO MALLALLY.
Caliah&n
Gave a "tea* âa sort of "rally"â
To Mallally,
Who had safely sailed a course
Of rocky "exams" for the "force."
Xo 1 ily of the valley
Was ever garted as was Mallally.
The night he first '
Struck the street
The darkness fled away
And 'twas day,
For his buttons were a sunburst
On the beat.
When afar
His star
Shone
Above his belted zone
Paralytic consternation
Seized the station.
So Mallally, the cop beauty,
When all harm ssed up for duty.
From his helmet in the air
To his brogans on the sod
Was the prize-exhibit tnere
And the glory of tne squad
The idea of a "rally"
To Mallally
Had been caught
As it ran
Through the dome of thougbt
Of Lanigan.
It may be well expected
That Daniel recollected
That no human being living
Was more adept in giving â
Tnat no man on earth abiding
Was more expert providing
Creature comfort than
Callahan.
Aibeit he told Donovan,.
Wno concurred,
And said the plan
Was a "bird."
I'ossib' y some o ther dishes
S ;ch as loaves and fishes
Wore the kind
Running riot through his mind.
When Mallallv
At the rally
Had been felicitated,
Toasted, lauded, dedicated
From drink to drinkâ
And each particular link
Oi fellowship's eternal chain
Had been drenched again, again,
McGuire got to his feet.
Steadied by O'Con.ior,
And said they had the honor
" There to meet
One whose noble name
Was a searchlight on the glowing
Gulden dome of fame ;
From Pierian fountains flowing
Stnamt of classic lore, this man
Of godly eminence and rank
Had arank"â
(Here Lanigan,
With great precipitation
And elation.
Moved they pour a full libation
Out to godlike Mallally
And the rally).
" A man," went on McGuire,
When the rites were ended
And each deifier
And his draught had blended,
" A man whose reputation
Is an illumination
On the pages
Of the ages.
Brush ana pen
Have combined to glorify
Such men;
Empires have erected
Tombs to such a man-
Though they never dieâ
Nations have elected"â
(Here Donovan
Awoke and heard
The final word,
And proposed they ratify
MalUlly,
And likewise the rally).
McGuire,
When each joyful ratifier
Had i nu himself on record, said,
" Tate the wine* of morning; tread
The farther bounds of time â
In deeps profound, on heights sublime
Speed away
Beyond the solar ray,
Beyond the splendid force" â
(At this arose MePhail
Of the police-court detail,
And said he had the honor
As did Officer O'Connor
To be of that fine body which in course
Of his remarks the speaker had
Alluded to; and he would add
Th;it they couldn't better make reply
To the sentiment than by
Arising to Malially,
The "force" and the rally).
" âOf gravity," spoke on McGulre,
His train of thought still on the track;
When each repiier
Had made reply and settled back
In his chair.
" Go on and onward where
The burning constellations run
Around some distant central sun ;
Then search each bounding planet o'er,
Beyond"â (McNally
Got the floor.
While he agreed
To all the speaker said, he'd
Take the liberty to state
That while they wait
For Mac to find a star
They could find the bar
And toast Mallally).
When the crowd returned to him
Mnc sailed along through regions dim;
" Beyond," he said, "beyond the flight
Of all conception not of infinite,
Till time itself snnll be
Lost in blank immensity" â
(II 're uneasy, thirsty Ryan
Nndzed O'Brien,
And in a heavy whisper, said he
Thoueht much time was lost already
" Betwixed the drinks," and if McGuira
Flew i
A few feet higher
They'd lose him too).
Then O'Brien slowly rising,
Said with much apologizing,
He was thinking
The hour had corns for drinking
To the honor of Mallally
And the rally. .
When they had done this, fclynn
Checked O'Hrien's speech by saying
Tney might as well begin
Without delaying
To toast Mallally's health,
Success and future wealth,
Which they did with vim
Across the merry goblet's rim.
He would have kept the floor, but McElrcy
Asked what greater joy
Could be theirs than in dispensing,
If the gentlemen were willing.
With other business, and commencing
Tne evening, so to say,
By filling upâ he got no furtherâ they
Shut off debate by filling.
When Dolan paid: "We may
Kill time by drinking"â they
Shut off debate by killing.
In this style rushed the rally
To Mallally.
Cfillahan,
When all had gone â
Had liuttered homeward through
The dewy golden dawn
That tinted hill and dale,
Was as "one
Who trod alone
Some banquet hall deserted."
Ho viewed his erst-filled fruitful store
To want and emptiness converted,
And hung a legend on the door
Which ran
" Bar and fixtures new,
For sale.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
Edward B. Carr, editor and proprietor of the
Fernd le Enterprise, the only sem'.-weekly
newsraper in the northern part of California,
and recognized as one of the best local papers
in the State, is registered at the Grand. He
was interviewed last evening by a (all repre
sentative, and reports good times in Eel River
I Valiey, now noted as one of the great >'.:.iry
j centers of the West, notwithstanding tfte gen
I eral business depression which prc-vails on the
| coast. Fernap.le is located In the heart of Eel
River Valley, o:nl '1 Â» bvautiful iiitic- city,
which has aboat duub.ed the numb-profits
buiiditips.
"The thousands and thousands of acres of
rich bottom land which surround the town,"
\ said Mr. Ciirr, â¦â¢furnish green fe d for the
i thousands and thousands of cows dairied In
iho valley. Eel River creameries, with their
moderu machinery, havj revoiutioaized i lie
j dairying industry in Humboldt County, hay
: in? brought Dutter-making down to a science,
â  and tneir production is now placed on the
market as the standard of excellence.
"The creamery has entirely supplanted the
old method of butter-making in the valley,
thus resulting in a material saving to the
dairymen in labor, e:c, as well as increas
ing the amount and greatly improving the
quality oi the product. By the separator pro
cess, it is estimated that aay given quality of
milk will yield 15 p?r cent more butter fat
than by the o.d time pan process.
"The creamery men of llumboidt County are
now well organized, having what is known as
the Humboldt ("r.-amery Exchange, and a large
number of the dairymen are also members of
the California Dairy Association."
Mr. Carr states that a fine new creamery 13
now being erected at Grizzly Bluff, three miles
from Ferudale, to take the place of the one
recently destroyed by fire, and when com
pleted, its owners hoce to have the best
equipped and most convenient creamery in
the State.
The pasturage in Eel River Valley is prin
cipally red clover arm grows proliflcaily
throughout the year without irrigation, and
it is not uncommon to cut three heavy crops
of clover hay from the same piece of land dur
ing n season. At Port Kenyon, two miles from
Ferndale, a condensed milk factory is in suc
ce?sful operation, and the product therefrom
is snid to equal the celebrated Gail Borden
brand. Messrs. Smith and Alexander, the
gentlemen in charge of the factory, are ex
perienced in the business, have means to back
it up and its success is already nssured.

New Yorkers are laughing at an absurdity of

that the Judge offered his services for experi

flush.' Whose Sobs?
YOKE NOGUCHI.
The bare tomb stands in the wind;
The veilless moon shivers, breathing her
yellow sighs Among the naked twigs;
The broKen banina leaves chant in silence
"We are content with sadness!"
The immovable hillside cabin is dumb,
enwrapped by tne â¢ thousand autumn
â¢voices.
Hush! A maiden's sobs! Are they the
ripple-tears of the friendless brook
breaking the stillness?
"Oh, my love, my love, lam here!" I murmur,
but I hear no reply in the darkness.
apSjALLEYRAND once remarked that lan
/.l^ guage was used to conceal thought, and
Y|y\ one is apt to recall this saying after the
"^^ first reading of Yone Noguchi's volume
of '-monologue," entitled "Seen and Unseen."
if a further acquaintance with the poems con
vinces us that there is a good deal to be said
on both sides of the question the fact remains
that the most obvious things have not been
said at all. Those who have professed to see
a very deeD and vital significance â¡ tnis
strange jumble of words should remember
that words, too, are vital, that their character
is built up by the consent of untold genera
tions of men and that no one has the right to
wrest the life out of them by any unwarranta
ble use. Hear what that critic who was strong
in this if he was weak in much else has to say:
"The material the painter or the scuiDtor uses
is meager in comparison with that of words.
Words have not merely music as sweet as that
of viol or lute, color as ricn ana vivid as any
that makes lovely for us the canvas of the
Venetian or the Spaniard, and plastic form no
less sure and certain than that which reveals
itself in marble or in bronze, but thought and
passion and spirituality are theirs also â are
theirs, indeed, alone. "
How daro one writer ignore the essential
being of a word gained by this universal con- i
sent'. 1 Why will critics forget tha: art nas re- i
quiremenls as well as capabilities! and that it
is not only a form of expression, but the most '
adequate, lucid and Deautilui form as veil?
But form of any kind is 120 part of these pro
ductions. They are Â»ore vague than jelly
fish. They make what Mr. Goase calls "litera
ture in the condition of protoplasm." They
are so *oose and disjointed that they are easily
molded into any shape and will give forth
;j&t as much meaning as the Individual !
reader puts into them; and this is no 1
doubl the secret of their attraction for some
very intelligent people. This is the gist of
Mr. Gosse's explanation of Walt Whitman's
charm, and it seems to apply with equal force
to Youe Noguchi. But the mere fact of a
vagueness sr.fficient to charm a reader into
seeing a reflection of his own thought is
hardly a warrant as to the excellence of a !
piece of writing. It might so easily be only
utter nonsense after all. If our minds are bent
upon it we can discover a profound ethical
significance in that delightful rhyme of our
ood,
Four and twerity blackbirds baked in a pie,
&s a recent philologist has with delicate irony
pointed out.
It would seem comparatively easy to be
merely unintelligible, and many of us without
even aspiring to be poets might write such
lines as:
xÂ»<Jiag Ho* of love-deal rose sing of passed dam
sels' salness (or pleasure?) colored, juicy caeeks.
Frankly, however, it is not as easy as it
seems. One can imagine the zest with which
' Nordau would have classified the author of
this. Amoa; the ranks of his ''degenerate"
how he would have hurled his choicest adjec
tives, hysterical, egomaniacal at his defense
less head. With what scorn would lie have
recardea "the deep, deepness deepness in the
beginning"; "the gray-boned wind," "the
saber-cornered wind"? In truth, one is
templed to ask, why "gray-boned"? and why
â¢ "=aber-cornered"? We are used to a wind with
astiarpedge, even to a wind with teeth, but
why accustom ourselves to a geometrically
shaped wind with coraers? These are the i
places where we are half-inclined to think, it
a.l a huge joka and ourselves the more fools
for taking It seriously. And we remember'
that the editor of these poems was the author
â¢ of the --Purple Cow," and the man who would
i "rather have fingers than toes," that delight
â¢ fully inconsequential nonsense, which many
wise reop.e took to be a burlesque en this
very sort of writing.
And then we read a little farther till we
come â
U matchless Mistress Moon in a chamber of un
fathomable peace,
And our unbelief changes to a mood half-way
. between pleasure and perplexity. Again, we
read:
Wheo I am lost In the deep body of . the mist on
the hi.!,
The wor.d seems built with me a* its pillar.
And again:
Dreamy peace dwelt with me, whose magic vapors
inclosed roe, softly as lovers' shadows,
And we come to believe that while enthusiasts
are undoubtedly seeing in the po.-msagood
deal of what they themselves take there, the
people who reject them as absolute nonsense
are probably quite as much mistaken on the
other side.
Any reader with even a slight knowledge of
oriental literature and mysticism has some
undeis landing of Noguchi's pointof view, and
without this it is hopeless to attempt the
poems. Even the readers of Fitzgerald'y partly
occidentallzed Omar have more chance here.
What lover of the Ktibaiyat, when he recalls
tome little talk awhile of me and thee
There wasâ aDd then do more of thee and me,
has not more tolerance for "When I come
back to me." "When the future shall be the
past," "I come Dack to me," or 'I go on to
me," "Shali be as me," "What do I mean by
me? I, whom the god made at first for
me- I
If we have pondered with the Persian mys- i
tics on thÂ« relativity of everything morbid and |
â¢ the unreality of all outward aspects, we see
what he would arrive at when he says:
The world Is round; no-headed, no-fooLed;
Having no left side, no right side!
And to say Cicodnes* Is to say Badness,
And to say Badness Is to say < ness.
The wor.d Is bo filled with names; often the
necessity is forgotten, often the difference Is un
named.

The good man stands In tbe world lite an un

There is to many minds a peculiar fascina- ]
I tion in the illusive, the mystical, the
transcendental. But after all this is nothing
! new. it is as old as thought and has been ex
! In countless ways. Of course we all
know that originality ij only seeing freshly
, and presenting freshly the same old subject;
but does not that imply presenting it clearly
| aud poignantly? A mere extravagant use of
; words will not accomplish this. At tne same
time, one at all in sympathy with Oriental
thought cannot read Noguchi's lines without
finding indications of real poetic feeling and
' occasional poetic expressions. And granted
: this much one realizes how easy it would be to
read into ail the verses deep meanings and
'. subtle beauties, and, like Narcissus, become
quite enraptured with our own reflection in
j this stream of wards.
[ Let us quote further from Mr. Gosse: "There
! is one condition which distinguishes art from
mere amorphous expression; that condition is
the result of a process through which the
vague and engaging observations of Whitman
never passed * * * he lay spread abroad in
a condition of literary solution â¢ â¢ â¢ wait
! ing for the structural change which never
j came â¢ â¢ â¢ for want of a definite shape
| and fixity doomed forever to sit apart from
the company of poets." If for "Whitman"
we read Xoguchi. and apply these words p.s in
deed they seem to apply, to him, his admirers
mignt retort that we are bringing a heavy bat
tery to bear upon an unarmed man, and that
th s young Japanese, with his imperfect
knowledge of our English tongue, makes no
claim of art for his verses or of a place for
! himself in that "magic realm." The answer
seems obvious that the author of a published
j volume of poems does put forth a tacit claim
| of consideration as a poet, and that if he uses
I the English language he s.iould abide by the
laws of that languageâ indeed, he
would wish us to regard nis productions as â¢
! did that amiable reader whose sex inclined her
| to kindness, and who, after puzzling througa
J half a dozen of the ''monologues," remarked:
"Well, no doubt he writes much better poetry
i in English than we could in Japanese."
This much surely the most exacting critic
\ would be willing to grant.

FOR THE STUDIOUS
CHRISTIANITY AND IDEALISMâ By John
Watson, LL.D. The Macmillan company. New
York. Price $1 25. For sale by William
Do.tey, Palace Hotel, City.
This is the second volume of the publications
j of the Philosophical Union of the University
1 of California and is a natural sequel to the
, author's previous work, "Comte, Mill and
Spencer," which has been the basis of the
: studies of the Philosophical Union during the
i year 1895-189 G. The criticism of that book
was submitted to counter criticism by the
members of the union wno were deepest
versed in the sciences discussed. This later
work of Dr. Watson is â¢the completion of his
j part of the discussion. It treats of the Chris
' tifin ideals of life in its relation to the Greek
j and Jewish ideals and to modern philosophy.
The author shows how Christianity was de-
J veloped out of Judaism and Hellenism, and
hew idealism rose out of lower philosophies
such as empiricism, positivism and agnos
ticism. He exposes the onesidedness that
would recognize the negative thought of the
age exclusively, but he does not dismiss this!
thought as worthless. He would only keep it
in its proper relations to the. more definite and
lruitful systems of philosophical and reli
gious thought. He regards a belief in God, in
our responsible Ireedom, and in our immor- I
tality, as a necessary foundation of civilized
society. He shows that the union of morality
and religion cannot be severed without the
destruction of both.
The whole history of man goes to prove
that no advance of the one has ever taken
place without a going forward of the other.
He says what is distinctive of Christianity Is
not the union 01 morality with religion, but
the comprehensiveness of the principle upon
which that union is based. In conclusion we !
are told that Christianity must free itself from
the narrow conception of life by which Protes
tantism has tended to limit its principle, and
recognize that the ideal of Christian manhood
embodies the Groek love of beauty, the Jewish
ideal of righteousness, the Roman ideal of law
and order, and harmonizes all by the divine
spirit of love to Goa and man.
DONE EY THE DUCHESS
NOR WIFE NOR SIAID-By Mrs. Hnngerford.
American Publishers' Association, New York.
Paper 50 cents.
This is a reissue in paper cover of what Is
said to be one of the .Duchess' best novels.
Those who like this style of literature will no
doubt find the story very entertaiuing, arid
the Duchess' style is widely known. The
Literary World of Boston says: "There is no
use snubbing the Duchess. Her books sell
better than those of many standard authors."
So she is evidently giving multitudes of peo
ple what they want, and anyone who pays at
tention to the new books that are being pub
lished can see that some readers must make
worse selections than those who delight in her
productions.
The woman, who was neither wife nor maid, j
is good, sweet, beautifulâ all things neces- j
sary for a most fascinating heroineâ and her
i anomalous condition came about from her
, supposed marriage with a man whom she
i believed a widower, and who had every rea
son for believing himself one, but his wife had
'â  only seemed to die. The climax of the story
comes when this wife, who was neither loved
; nor lovable, is about to die for the second
time, while Mary, the heroine, is at the same
i time about to become .a mother. Then the
j good husband finds himself irantically and
j murderously wishing that the unloved wife
| might die in haste; he begrudges her even
i five hours of life. The sister of the heroine
! says she is going to get down on her knees
| and pray that the wife may die quickly, so
i that Mary may be happy instead of sad in her
; motherhood. The situation in which the
! Duchess has placed these people will be thnll
; ingly interesting to some tastes and intensely
absurd to others. "Every one to his own
taste."
FICTION ABOUT SCIENCE
FACING THE FLAG. By Jnles Verne. P.Ten
nyson Neely. Now York. Paper, 50 cents.
In conformity with his cu'ujm.JulesVerne has
here told us a most incredible wonder tale, but
which is nevertheless based to some extent on
the truths of science. If some of the men who
have passed the age of three score years and
J ten could by some hypnotic spell be made to
forget all that has happened in the last half
century, and then be given one of Jules
Verne's wild romances to read, he would scarce {
be able to pick out from the mingling of highly )
imaginative fiction and marvelous facts in the j
book, which were the truths and which the I
creations of exuberant fancy. When Tenny
son speaks of "nourishing a youth sublime
with the fairy tales of science and the
thoughts that shake Mankind," he no doubt i
means that the achievements of modern
science read like the marvels of a fairy tale;
aud in this story of Jules Verne's the part I
played by the submergible boat in which the j
pirate chieftain dives through the deeD sea to
the heart of a great grotto on one of the Ber
muda Islands, marvelous though it seems, is
based on one of the fairy tales of science
which are facts.
The story is about a half-crazed inventor
who has a new explosive of such destructive
power that whatever nation becomes owner of
it would be easy master of the world. He is
kidnaped by the pirate and carried off to the
pirete's lair in the heart of what the lnhabi
ta'riis of flic island are made to believe is a

LOVE LOST, BUT GREATNESS
GAINED.
CHKISTIaX VELLACOTT-Bv Henry Seton
Merriman. American Publishers' Corporation,
New York. Paper. Price, 50 cents.
A thoroughly good story, ot a singularly
strong character, is this account of the la
borious and well-tried life of the journalist,
Christian Veliacott. It records tne double
strain put upon an ambitious young man by
managing a great newspaper, and going every
night weary from his dest to the far more
wearying duties of an unhappy home. Ouce
he ventured to take a vacation for a month.
The relaxation from work was fatal to half his
hapraness, for he meets at a friend's country
house the woman he is to love, but not to
marry. A part of the story is a graphic ac
count of the communistic outbreak In Paris.
We are told that there can never be any real
peace for a man like Christian Vellacott, for
! ambition had set Its hold upon Him. Ha
wanted to do more than there was time for.
"Line many of us, he began ny thinking that
life la longer than it is." Disappointment
never made him wnver in his work, and at the
end of the story Veilacott's dear friend, the
Jesuit missionary, says to him: "And row
you are a great man. they tell me. I thought
there was some one ciÂ»e â some woman â who
was waiting for newt" "There is no woman
who wants news of me," said Veilacott, ','and
the result is, as you kindly say, I am a great
man nowâ in my way."

BALKED AMBITION.
MR. BAILEY-MARTIN. By Percy White.
American l'ubllsbers' Corporation, rvew Yoric.
Price, 00 cen,s, paper.
This story, told in the first person, starts out ;
with a Rousseau-iike promise to make a con- '
fession that would take off tho close-fitting j
case by which, "self" is covered and let the j
world see the mainspring of the teller's char- i
acter. It is a sad story told by a satirical man
with such a sense of humor as to brighten
pages that otherwise would be all too somber.
Mr. Bailey-Martin is born of parents who are j
vnrv anxious to get on in a worldly way, and j
the acsire to succeed and form connections j
with aristocratic families lias been a trait of |
so many of hi* ancestors that the boy iuherits j
a teudency that way just as a retrievar pup is
born with a faculty for retrieving.
A maxim of Martin's father was that It was
just as cheap to know noba as suods and much ,
y\t Sea.
Shall w<\ the storm-tossed sailors, weÂ«
For tnoso who may not sail again;
Or wisely envy them, and keep
Our pity for the living men?
Beyond the weary wagte of seaâ
Beyond the wider waste ol death,
I strain my gaze and cry to thee,
Whose still heart never auswereth.
O brother, is thy coral bed
So sweet thou wilt not hear my speech?
This hand, methinka, if I were dead,
To thy dear hand would strive to reach.
I would not, if God gave us choice
For each to be-or the other's part,
That mine should be the silent voice
And thine the silent, aching heart.
Ah, well for any voyaee done,
Whate'cr its end â or port or reef;
Better the voyage ne'er begun,
For all ships sail the sea of Grief.

Perchance 'tis true, as often so it seems.
We see truth clearest in the land of dreams.

more honorable. Under the power of heredity
and parental admonition the youth does not
realize that he himself becomes a snob in try
ing to carry out too strenuously this maxim.
At school he assiduously cultivates the friend
ship of the delicate sou of a lord, and when he
is spending his holidays with this boy he con
forms to the liitie lord's custom of taking a
dose of nauseous codliver oil every day to pro
pitiate her ladyship, his mother. "Just fancy
trying to suck up to a fellow's people by taking
codliver oil" was tne contemptuous criticism
of one of his schoolmates. Following this bent
of early training Martin when grown to man
hood chooses for a wife the daughter of a
Countess, who proves a far worse dose than
codliver oil once a day. Out of this unhappy
inarriuge come the causes of the wreck of the
moral reDUtatioa of the husband and the balk
ing of his political and pnilanthropical ambi
tions, which he was close to the accomplish
ment of.
TREATMENT CF CONSUMPTION
Dr. Albert Abrams of this City has written
"A Popular Catechism on Consumption,"
which represents in substance one ot his lec
tures delivered at Cooper Medical College.
The work is a modest one, in which technical
terms and phrases have been studiously
avoided. Hence, it will be found of consider
able value to those who are eitner suffering
from or fear the ravages of tubercular com
plaints.
Dr. Abram? divides his work into chapters,
these being systematically subdivided into
headings. He shows the reiation between
various biood complaints and tha main dis
ease, and indicates both the method of detec
tion an>i the treatment to be followed in cases
01 consumption. Of particular value are tne
suggestions contained in chapter IV, headed
"Toe Prevention of Consumption," wnerein
are described the precautions that should be
tr.ken against infection. Those having the
care of consumptives will also read withinter
est what Dr.'Abrams has to say regarding the
dietetic treatment of the patient on page 22.
The work may be recommended both to stu
dents and to the general public as being a
carefully compiled manual upon the treat
ment of tuberculosis in all its forms. The
thesis is published by Willlnm Doxey.
LITERARY NOTES
A writer in an English literary publication
declares that Jules Verne never made more
than $4000 in any one year. Zoli\'s annual
income is believed to be about $1500,000.
A particularly bright and attractive number
of Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly is that for
February. It has a long list of good articles
and capital short stories, and almost every
thing is illustrated.
Mary E. Wilkins is engaged in writing a ser
ies of striking sketches of New England neigh
borhood life for the Ladies' Home Journal.
They will portray a small community's social
indulgences, sketching tne old-fashioned
quilting- party, the time-worn singing-school
and an. apde-paring bee.
The third revised edition of a detailed
course, "Qualitative Chemical Analysis," with
explHhatory note?, by Arthur A. Noyes, Ph.D. ,
assistant professor of chemistry in the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, published by
the Macmillan Company, is now in prepara
tion and will appear early in February.
Henry Patmore, a son of the late Coventry
Patmore, is said to give promise of unusual
poetic genius. Some of his poems have al
ready been print-.d for private distribution.
They are not uuiike those of his father in his
most fanciful and delicate mood, and are rich
in originality and an intensely pure
charm. Oue of them appeared in the London
Athenjeum several years ago.
Mrs. Julia Taft Bayne has written for the !
February St. Nicholas an article about "Willie ,
and Tad Lincoln." Whi.ethe President's sons
were living in the White House Mrs. Bayne's '
brother was their most intimate playmate, :
and she herself, then a young girl, saw much of j
them. Mrs. Bayne describes the pranks of the j
Lincoln boys, and tells of a minstrel show !
that was given in the White House.
Seven general officers in the Civil War will
contribute to a disenssion In the February
Century of the paper by Duucan Rose, "Why
the Confederacy Failed," published in a re
cent number of this magazine. The writers
are: Generals S. D. Lee, Joseph Wheeler, E.
P. Alexander and K. M. Law of the Confed
erate army, and Generals Dou. Carlos Buell, O.
O. Howard and Jacob D. Cox of the Union
army.
"A Great Hotel," which appears in the Feb
ruary Scribner's as the second article on "The
Conduct of Great Businesses," gives some
astounding facts as to this modern develop
ment ot one of the oldest businesses in the
world. There are as many employes in a great
hotel as there are guests; there is a man wnose
whole duty it is to wind clocks; one head
waiter in a great hotel owns a yacht a^fi a
summer residence: and hotels nave their pri
vate blacksmith and paint shops.
The advance sheets of a book of short stories j
by James S. Tyler, the well-known marine i
reporter of the Bulletin, entitled "Stories of i
Land and Sea," have been received here. The
volume will be published in New York and
placed on sale in all the principal cities of the
United States. It contains a collection of
stories of adventure and romance, many of
which have never been printed in the papers !
or periodicals, although some of the selections !
are from sea yarns written by the author for
the New York and San Francisco papers.
Those who desire copies of the book may order
them in advance by addressing Mr. Tyler, care
of the Bulletin.
It seems that Janet Carfy^e, Thomas Car
lyle's sister, is still alive. The rector of Rip
ley, in Bruce County, Ontario, writes to the
Worcestershire Chronicle: "Mrs. Robert
Hannine, the 'Janet Carlyle* of Froude's remi
niscences (my much-beloved mother-in-law),
is keeping in excellent health for a lady who j
passed her eighty-third birthday on July 18 j
last. She is now the last of the Carlyles, and a
melancholy interest attaches to ner. Her ]
present residence is at Comely Bank Farm, I
near Oakville, in Halton County, Ontario, the j
home of Mrs. John R. Leslie, her eldest ;
danghter. She passes most of her time in her ,
room, rereading many of her brother's works,
certain favorite religious authors, and her ;
Bible."
"Under the Pacific" is the title of the Lip- j
pincott's Magazine novel for Februaryâ a j
story of treasure-hunting among the Ladrone !
Islands, in which the author, Clarence Her- j
bert New, has evidently drawn upon personal :
experience as a traveler to give a realistic nar- i
rative which comes well within the range of '
possibility. His two heroes conceive the idea
that an attempt to recover upward of three
millions from the hulk of an old Spanish
galleon, which lies four fathoms under water
upon one of. the coral reefs, might be success
ful under certain conditions; and reasoning i
out their method of procedure upon theoretic i
grounds they actually secure the money, en- !
joy several weeks of delightful tropic life !
among the Spanish islanders, and finally
many two Audalusian girls who have helped
them to outwit a Philippine Bishop, also in j
search of the treasure. A chart of their voyage ;
is published in the magazine.
The Macmillan Company announce an in
teresting volume under the title of '-Geog
raphy of the Middle Ages," by C. Raymond
Beazley, author of a volume in the "Heroes of
the Nations" series, entitled "Henry the Navi
gator, the Hero of Portugal and the Modern
Discovery." In his new work he shows how
very much geography owes to tbe early pil
grim travelers, who at different periods did so
much to increase the limns of western geog
raphy. He shows that such ideas as were gen
erally held during the middle ages as to the
geography of the earth were due to two
sources aside from the important one men
tioned above. Of these two one was gradually
increasing commercial and missionary travel,
and the other the writings of theorists merely,
untraveled s'.udentÃ, mostly theologians,
whose work? are many of them described by
Mr. Beazley. To this class, at least in part,
belongs tee weil-known collection of stories
known as tnc "Sin bad Tales."
New York's famous thoroughfare, Broadway'
has been the scene of some wonderful events,
but tbe one scene which still stands as the
most remarkable. In point of enthusiasm, is
Louis Kossuth's famous ride up Broadway in
1851. Kossuth had already seen and passed
through a crowd of 500,000 people in his
triumphal ride up the ereat thoroughfare.
The culminating moment, however, occurred
when the great Hungarian patriot reached the
corner of Broadway and Ann street. The sijjht
that burst upon him staggered him for the
momsnt. In the open square directly before
him was massed togetheraquarterof a million
of people, and when this vast concourse broke
into a united cheer Kossuth was fairly be
wildered. No man saw this great event so
well and advantageously asd:d Parke Godwin,
the veteran New York editor and Kossuth'*
closest friend in America. Mr. Godwin was
with Kossuth, and for the first time he will
now tell the story of the marvelous event in
the February Ladies' Home Journal. The
actual scene at Ann street will also be shown
in a picture by DeThulstrup, showing Kossath
in his carriage as the great scene burs: upon
him.
CALIFORNIA VERSE
The follow ing extracts from George J. Dtir*
aind's poem, which was referred to last Sunday
in these coh mns, will give a more adequate
idea of Its spirit and purpose. The first relates
to the birth of the modern world at the period
of the revival of learning, when man threw off
the tyranny of the moral ideal and reasserted
the sway of his physical and intellectual
natures:
THE RENAISSANCE.
The dead awoke ! The great of bygone time*
In glorious resurrection from their tombs
Koie like Immortal spirits of the past.
Flaming the lights of ni<dom on mansind.
And with ihelr reappearance passed away
The somber clouds, the dark funereal hues
1 hat settled like a pa 1 upon the earth.
The lite that was as dumb, and cold, and bare.
The sackcloth and the ashes worn in pride,
The scorn if ieainin* as a Pnsan vice,
The Faustus dream of terror, that the soul
Could purchase knowledge by its doom alone.
M mi woke as from a tronblsd dream oppressed.
The crippltd powers of the mind telfaied
From their ascetic bondage took new wings
In freedom's air, and led by Petrarch's mnse
In an enchanted realm, once more perceived
In io vellneas a canon most divine.
The stones reanimate wuh tales of o d
Sj-oke in tritir sculpture language of the past
Of glory, long forgotten as the dead.
The sun once more Illumed the blue of heaven,
Once more the flowers smiled within the fields
In splendor m of yore, and once a^aln
Fair nature with her thousand tongues proclaimed
The goodliness of earth and earthly life.
Tbe following is a characterization of one of
the greatest of the medieval artists, a univer
sal genius of the Renaissance:
LEONARDO PA VINCI.
Framed like a Hercuies, within his face
I here shone a ruÂ»jes:y sublime with lights
Which awed while they attracted tnose who saw.
The face had all the grandeur that the Greek
Oave to Olympian deity in stone.
A very prince in courtesy, refined
To sweetest eloquence of speech, and act
Enirancins in i â  ;.e;ieroui chivalry.
None could resist ttie magic of bis tongue
A voice whose or^an richness charmed the ear
With more than music's spe:l. made him the pride
Of Florence in the^ialace ot the fair.
No horseman rode with such a daring grace,
Nor could he firrt a rua:ch in manly sports.
So strong his fingeri ben: a coin with ease,
Then like a woman's swept the golden lyre
Till the delicate strinss beueath his touch
Shook with divine vibrations. Not an art
Or science failed to bow before his will.
So full had the divine revealed itself
To him, he merely looked and saw the troth
With grasp intuitive in nature's realm.
In sculpture, Sfonta's Horse proclaim his kia
To antique masters, ere it was destroyed.
And even to this day the painter sighs
Before the Mona Lisa at ihe art
Of him whose vision fixed the face of Christ
For all the generations of mankind.
Here is an example of the treatment of one
of the ethical functions of art:
BEALISM AND THE HInHER LIFB.
\ Tbe higher life, of tbis do not all dream?
And is li lived? Yes, here aud there obscnred
, In Isolated charac:ers. Unknown,
\ Unnoticed oft, its s'.rong divineness lost
Upon the sensual bllnJ.ed, sill i- sounds
The one true note among the thousand false.
| A woman here the deeper music strikes,
And here a man new rhythms from the chords
Of individual life evokes. Ever
The human hears the OoJ-volce speak-in; plain
Above the world's roar, hears and answers
I â  straight
With the full force of an untrammeled soul
In personal act coDCOrdam with the reach
j of man's ideal sense. Alt catches quici
: Ere they are lost for aye these vibrant note*
! And blenJ a ihe;r sweetness lo a harmony
j Immo rul and complete. Great artists thrill
: To every wave of higher life thai strikes
I From out the human sea. And here Is seen
[ Their noblett function. Every form they mold
: Perpetuates perfections thus impinged
I Upon their souls from out their restiess age.
: They seize upon the go.d of higher life,
j A nd brush aside the cosmic dust until
i The crystalline of purest spirit gleams
Emancipated from the sensucl world,
So teeing will the drooping heart take cheer,
And the faint soul renew its failing strength.
The closing extract shows the treatment of
! art thought with which the work abounds in
; its 5000 lines:
! CLASSICAL LAW THR FXCHANTBES3 OF THE
ARTS.
; There Is a phantom figure in the arts
i Luring the souls of artists to their ruin
, Siren-like, so bewitching all who seek
' Her smile, that ever af;er heart and hand
Are held In bondage. He who once submits
' To ideal beauty as a constant guide
! Abandons fact for fiction, and for him
I In vain without a charm fair nature wreathes
j Her thousand faces In a thousand smiles.
For he who thinks he can improve on these
j By combination never can behold
: Perfection in a natural line aiain.
For such the very soul of beauty dies
| In an Impoisible abstraction, such
Pursue in vain a mocking cloud with loss
Of every noble power in their work,
And at their beit their lines Mill slide into
The pompous nomenclature of an art,
Dead to all vital feelings of delight,
< In which a sickly loveliness conceals
i The skeleton of unreality. Beware
; The snare of ideal beauty, .Florentines!
I No man can reach beyond the works of him
i Who stamped the petals of the morning ro.*e,
| Upon tbe mountains wrote sublimity,
: And drew himself within the form of man.
! Tbe proclamation of the law divine
! Of beanty can be found In nature's realm
; Alone, where all who seek may find inspherea

"THE SONG OF THE SHIRT."
During his last illnsss Tom Hood, in an
die moment, made an imaginative sketch
of his own tombstone. He drew himself re
cliniiiK at full length on a thick slab of stone,
on the edge of which, in large capitals, be
wrote, "He Sang the 'Son? of the Shirt,' "
This was the only inscription, and, as he
himself has said, Tom Hood needs no other.
How much he felt and prided himself upon
the song by which he became known and
loved by millions is shown by this and the
following fact: "If I were ennobled these are
the arms 1 should adopt," said he one day,
! showing a rough vignette to a friend. Tne
sketch contained a Tory beautiful and
pathetic idea. It represented a heart pierced
by a needle threaded with silver tears, and
beneath was tbe motto he had inscribed on
the imaginary tombstone.
"The Song of the Shirt" appeared in the
Christmas number of the fifth volume of
Punch. It was unsigned, but every paper in
I the land quoted it, and it speedily became the
| talk of the day. Hood himself did not think
it very rtmarkable, but Mrs. Hood had said to
him as she folded it for press, "Now mind,
1 mark mv words, this will tell wonderfully. It
I is one of the best things you ever did."
Mrs. Hood was right. Tne sone was trans
lated into French, German and Italian; it
was printed on cheap cotton handkerchiefs
and parodied times without number. "But
what delighted and touched my poor father
most deeply." says Tom Hood's son, "was that
the poor creatures to whose sorrows and suf
ferings he had given such eloquent voice
seemed to adopt Its words as their own by
singing them about the streets to a rude air of
their own composition."
The biography of Lord Tennyson proceeds
slowly. It was thought at first that the delay
was caused by consideration for persona now
living, but it is said that the great magnitude
of the "Life" Impedes progress. Some bulky
volumes may be exptcted when the present
Lord Tennyson completes his labor.

T Â£L--JJE> have only just put away our |
Â«'-Il r fS beloved shirtwaists and lo! here |
wfji^ they are to tempt us again. I j
have yet, to knew a woman who can resist \
a summer shirtwaist.
Winter ones are different. They coat â 
more, in the first place, and are not dainty j
ana fresh and bewitching. Tne new ones j
are more irresistible than ever before. In
place of the stripes and checks and the j
self-colorings we have white grounds with j
brilliant floral designs. Brown and blue ]
and green grounds with ferns and leaves j
in lovely contrasts, and black grounds |
with white and colored blossoms. Such a I
brilliant, bewildering, becoming array!
It is positively wicked to tempt poor j
women in this way. I am ashamed to ;
confess it, but I bought six of them and I j
had already two dozen. In addition to .
the display of shirtwaist? "the new store- j
keeper" ofrera us summer materials that j
are positive dreani3 !
Old Fabrics Revived.
We are going back to our grandmother's j
time. A silk warp "barege" is v.ithout
doubt to be "the thing" of the season.;
The texture, as of course you know, is !
that of a closely woven Brussels net, and
while this has not changed at all the j
modern designs are very much prettier !
than the samples of the old-time material '
which I have seen, so that we have a
slight advantage over our grandmothers
in that respect. The prettiest patterns are j
those with dark ground strewn with
quaint figures in the real old broche col
orings. There are many with light
grounds tinted with new and delicate ;
shades of pink and blue, and one, inter- ;
woven with a figuring of deep purple, â 
really must be seen to be appreciated.
Satin striped French challies era also
shown. They are for the most part cov
ered with large floral designs, with the
stripes about one-quarter of an inch wide, '.
and about three inches apart. The colors
incline toward shades of blue, with the I
designs of a darker snade.
t'haliies in foulard designs are also sure
to be fashionable, some of them having
white grounds thrown into relief by de
signs of different colors and shades.
fioods for Summer* .Maids.
Dainty little snmmer maids who aspire
to the "fluffy" in winter and the "Airy
fairy Lillian" style in warmer weather
will fiud comfort and delight in the new
figure-dotted Swiss which is interlaced
with colored stripes, alternating various
kinds with flowers and leaves. There are
so many of "the new things" tLat I am at
a loss to know which will plea-e you best.
The new organdies are interlaced with
flowers of tints so natural that one won
ders why the fragrance is not. there, and it
is a noticeable fact that the designers this
year have seemed to realize that tne
beauty in floral patterns is not dependent
upon the amount of flowers, but rather
upon their artistic distribution. Most of
the designs seen this coming summer will
be more delicate in treatment, and instead
of seeing a mass of roses in a bunch, we
shall see them in graceful clusters with
leaves and buds trailing from the stem.
I suppose I must say a word about the
striped nainsooks, which, woven with
stripes of almost imperceptible fineness,
are certainly very pleasing to the eye.
And then there is anew fabric â mousseline
de I'lnaeâ a kind'of filmy net that will
not crush out of shape. This is sure to be
used extensively.
"The "tea iray" is becoming fashion
able. I have long been convinced that
women do not take sufficient food, ana
the other day I noticed that Mrs. Lynn
Linton was possessed with exactly the
barne idea, and had begun a crusade
against "starving for comfort."
That Jioppible TpaÂ«y .Habit.
Mrs. Linton describes the "tray" in all
its horrors. She explains that it produces
unhappiness in the home and discomfort
to the offender. Women have for ages
called man a "beast," the creature of his
appetite, but I am thoroughly convinced
that he has common-sense. If a woman
has a day's shopping to do, a solitary sar
dine with a little jam and a roll is not the
proper Kind of food to do it on, even it it
is served on a tray, 30 that one can eat it
in the bedroom in a costume more com
fortable than pretty. There is nothing
like solid food, and if any one chooses to
think me too masculine because I eat a
good steak for breakfast I don't care a
jot. Now there is Miss \\ . a very nice
girl, as you know, except that she is lazy.
Bhe has actually brought trouble on her
self and her family, sitnply because she is
a victim to the l[ tray." Of course it
would never do to tell the stories that are
afloat, but it is really a fact that the ser
vants are doing as they please, simply be
cause they have got into the habit of never
cooKing anything when "master is away.''
I have noticed, too, that half the women
shoppers spoil their appetites by going
round to various stores and tasting this
thing and that until I do not believe they
would know tne flavor of a well-cooked
chop. But I must tell you something
more about the fashions and stop preacii
ing.
.New Presents JlHowed.
It has been the cause of much regret
among the fair sexâ at least many of
them â that the fashion of the day had
prevented women from accepting from a
gentleman presents of a "wearable" char
acter, such as .a new gown or a handsome
bonnet. i<or these there is at least a little
comfort to be found in the new custom
just sprung up of presenting a lady with
a jeweled or enameled girdle, such as are
fast becoming worn on the outside of fur
coats and cloaks. In regard to the receiv
ing of presents, men have always been
more fortunate than women, but this
"Fshion's
Decrees"
gnnson Dame Fashion has taken some
thing of n. turn. Thero are pood-luck
cffcrinss, now quite the thing for a Jady
to accept, and which take the most won
.â erful range in variety you can imagine.
Golden hearts, small jeweled daggers,
nails of gold and gems, and a hundred
other oddities are all prepared, so that the
"mean man" may find no excuse for not
presenting his lady love with anything
tnut is "wearable."
Dining Off Bare Tables.
I am sure you will be pleased to hear
that dinner parties are daily becoming
more fashionable, and also that the old
formal way of entertaining i.-i becoming a
thing of the past. Al! the old somberness
has gone, it giving way to an air of more
geniality. One does not have to look for
ward to a dinner party as a place where
you must sit with gloomy face and not
speak until you are spoken to, as our
mothers used to tell ns when wo were
young, or I should say, when we were
children.
And the innovation of a little fun round
a dinner table has given rise to other inno
vations. The very latest at dinners is to
serve dessert on a polished table with the
cioth removed. This fashion has received
the stamp of approval from the very hiÃh
est of the "bon ton" sot, in fact was first
introduced, or rather reintroduced, for it
is an old-time custom of the Princess of
Wales. Many young hostesses have
grieved because their handsome tables
were hidden beueath a linen cloth, and of
course no eicuse would have been toler
ated that would allow of the showing of
the often handsome wood concealed
underneath.
.New Floral Decorations.
The newest modes ot floral arrangement
for use at dinners are also adding not a
little to the charm of this form of enter
tainment, some of those seen at the
really first-class dinners being specimens
of the most fairy-like loveliness. In fact,
it is difficult to imagine how human hands
could make them so delicately. One,
which I saw the other day, in particular
took my fancy. It was a rustic stand as a
center piece frosted over, and glittering
iiKe a diamond in the paie moonlight. It
was so arranged that a deep slender basket
was held aloft by sticks all frosted and
looking perfectly natural. The basket
concealed a tin can, inside of which grew
several trailing plants and flowers, formed
into a Darti-coiored horseshoe, the whole
being brightened by the light of a dozen
tiny fairy lamps gracefully hidden in the
leaves and blossoms. The whole thing is
bo light and airy in appearance that it
seemed as if the' slightest breath would

frills and satin butterfly puffs at the top. The white felt hat is trimmed with feathers and blue velvet.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 189 T.
opposite sides of the table. There are
many of these stands in use, all kinds of
designs being seen, and they are also a
most economical kind of decoration.
Sometimes they are placed on a largo
mirror, and this adds to their attractive
ness.
.Hand-Glass Indispensable.
I have something oil my mind, it is
this: That I ought to write on the abso
lute necessity of a hand-glass to every
woman; not that I think that every
woman makes up, but a hand-glass is as
searching as the public eye if properly
used. It, revaals all the faults of our ap
pearance without fear or favor, and this is
a good thing sometimes. We must ail
confess that we like to look as well as pos
sible, and we must also confess, if we be
truthful, that there are only a few of us
who do not now and then use a touch of
powder. What we do wish to insist on is
that no trace of powder can ever be seen
on our faces. And this is where the hand
glass is indispensable. There is no doubi
that a little powderâ and I think a little
rouge now and then â adds considerably to
the appearance, but for the sake of woman
hood, do not go on the street after apply
ing either without first consulting a hand
mirror. Do not ba satisfied with a
full-length pierglass; these are deceptive
things. Get a hand-mirror and stand
with your back to the light, letting its
ponetrating rays tell their own tale. If
you take my advica you will never nave
cause to blush because some spitelul old
thin^ on a streetcar says with a smile,
"Excuse me, my dear, but your powder is
rather patchy on your forehead."
Tl^e Latest in Sfyoes.
Before I say cood-by to you I must
I teil you something about the various pat
terns and kinds of shoes I have seen re
' cently. Nothing makes a woman look so
neat as a pretty shoe, and no one article
! of dress can so effectively destroy the
wnole appaarance if it is ill-fitting or
u r 'ly in bhape.
I will not speak of walking-shoes, be
i cause we all have our own peculiarities
I in this regard and black 13 the only winter
â¢ wear, but in the tlress shoe every con
ceivable tinfis to be seen, and you may
be surprised to know that our footwear
can now be adorned by jewels without
being considered vulgar.
One of the most charming shoes I have
seen this season is of soft pink kid, em
broidered with pale green beads on the
toe in the form of a triangle. An ideal
shoe for a bride is of white sati'i, richly
embroidered with diamonds and pearl
heads. Another, perhaps prettier, is of
white satin embroidered with jewels of
different coiors, in the form of a butterfly.
Many persons do not like to wear white
shoes because they make the feet look
large, aud for these I would bespeak the
i wnite kid embroidered on the toe with
; blac& beads. Besides looking very pretty
these shoes are also less expensive than
the others I have mentioned. Bronze
leather will of course always have its ad
vocates, it being such an economical
shade and making such a delightful com
bination when a topaz is the jewel used.
You expect me to say something about
jewels now, but I shall disappoint you,
leaving that for auother time.

Bed (Jackets.
Many women really do look better in
these now delightfully pretty garments
than at any other time, for they are made,
frequently, of the most deliciously artis
tic materialsâ silken on the suiface and
striped, interwoven with wool. These are
usually embroidered in silks of a con
trasting color and adorned with lace frills
or muslin frills edged with lace. How
ever, some find such jackets too warm,
and prefer those of soft silk lined with
nun's veiling, beautified with either a
frill of the silk, lace edged, or one of
Valenciennes lace, which is really more
becoming. The tiannjl jackets are, many
of them, elaborately embroidered in white
filoselle or washing silk, when the scal
loped border should have a frill of lace.
A few years ago very little attention was
paid to our bedroom attire. Now old
fashioned and entirely out-of-date is the
woman who does not have the latest
sleeves in her nightgowns, and the most
modish of lace or embroidery. At the
present moment real Valenciennes is the
most stylish, and the yokes of such robes
are veritable works of art. Naturally the
bed jackets must likewise follow every
change advocated by Mme. La Mode, so
this winter they are cut so as to reach the
waist, of a somewhat Eton shape, and
some have a round, turned-down collar.
The palest of blue or pink bengaline
wilL make a dainty garment when either
creamy lace or chiffon matching the ben
galine is utilized. A chiffon fichu, tying

becoming. The full sleeves must be like
wise trimmed. For real comfort such
jackets should be lined with nun's vg;l
-ing, aa it is preferable to flannel as a lia
ing.
Vivella is a fabric much used aDd highly
recommended. It can \>3 had in most
satisfactory shades of blue and pink, and
when sufficient thought is bestowed on its
beautification makes most truly satisfac
tory jackets at about one-third the ex
pense involved by those of silk, bengaline
and chiffon.
Stockton Ware.
Those desirous of encouraging home in
dustry and enterprise would do well to
patronize this excellent production, which
is on sale at one of our large glass and
china stores. At first plance every one
thinks it Rookwood, but judges of such
things declare that its glaze is superior,
and truly beautifully do the artistic
browns, greena and yellows blend to
gether.
The shapes of the vases, ewers, pitchers,
teapots, jardinieres, etc., are graceful
enough to serve as models, and the prices
are most ridiculously low, $1 50 securing a
really lovely bit. A large shipment has
been sent East, and as many of us will
soon be thinking of our summer homes,
I strongly advocate an investigation of
the Stockton venture, for. a dear squat
pitcher would be an ornament for any
table, and a graceful, tulip-shaped vase
would increase 'the beauty of a handful of
wildflowers or ferns very materially. As
soon as I saw the numerous designs I
made the remark that steins would be
extremely appropriate and would be well
received, and I have suggested to a friend,
who is about tc furnish a houseboat, that
nothing could be found that would be
more artistic than this delightful ware in
her rooms, which are to be hung some
with blue and some with green denim. A
low fernpot and a handsome jardiniere
sent to Eastern friends were received with
many expressions of admiration and pre
dictions that the ware would in due time
rival tne-Rockwood, and it is certainly to
be hoped that, as we have many excellent
artist 3 here who could be induced to
sdecorate such productions, ere long Cali-
fornia may be known far and near for her
beautiful pottery. Marcella.
Bedroom Slippeps
Should in nil cases match the dressing
gown, for no longer will a pretty foot
permit itself to be shod incorrectly, even
in the seclusion o! the bedroom. As a re
sult slippers of quilteil satin with a buckle
drawn through the bow at the top are
popular, but if instead a cloth slipper
only can be afforded it can be made more
sightly by adding an edging of white fur.
Turkish slippers are worn by some, but
all must find them both hard and uncom
fortable, besides they are cold to put on.
Knitted and crocheted slippers are some
times comfortable and sightly, but they
are easily penetrated by pins, etc., and
t:*e fl?ece-lined soles are very heatine and
many find them extremely uncomfortable.
However, the prettiest I have seen are the
w;ilH?-iron pattern, done in two artistic
shades; the toes are pointed and the long
eared bows of ribbon are becoming to
most feet when properly placed below the
full ruched top, and for those suffering
from cold feet the night slippers made of
fine wool without soles are a great com
fort, I have been told. Mabcella.
Styles for Men.
Brown and tan kids as well as tne
snede are still the most fashionable, and
the fad of the heavy wh'te kid cloves for
afternoon wear is almost a ching of the
past, they having become far too common.
Him is at present in California, and so
in due course of time we may expect to
read his able criticisms on everything,
from our scarfpins to our dogoarts, and
speaking of pins remind 3me of a remark
made concerning them by this authority
quite recently. Ho writes:
"Tie pins are becoming more elaborate,
and friends write me that at some of the
recent weddings they received â acting as
ushers â the most gorgeous affairs in dia
monds and rubies. For those who are
about to marry, I would say that the
smart dress this season consists of black
frock coat, white double-breasted waist
coat, very light gray trousers and white
four-in-hand ties. The ascois with their
wide aprons and their narrow 'V are re
served for afternoon dress properâ that is,
for teas and calling and 'the like.' "
Him likewise informs us that "the
double-breasted white duck waistcoat has
become universal. Men wear the hiirh

Our leading haberdashers are making a
brave display of ties, hose, pajamas, etc.,
and most show good taste and judgment
in their selection. The pajamas made of
a material which is half silk, half wool,
give the most satisfaction, and when
some color is liked, pink and white or
pink and buff I can recommend, as pink
washes much better than blue, which has
a tendency to become almost whit^ after
one or two visits to toe laundry. Colored
socks are also liable to fade out with
equal promptitude. Indeed, I have found
the most expensive suclca in shades of
tan quite hideous after their first wash,
and that wash was done at an excellent
laundry. As a natural result black re
tains its place as iirst choice for ordinary
wear.

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLTHESE PEOPLE MUST LIVE AMD ACTUALLY DIE IN TUBS
r^X the general hospital at Vienna a re-
I > markable innovation has been made.
*. j Tt has been decided that certain, people
*nust live and actually die in tuba of
" â 
Night and day, many of them ud to
their chins in water which is kept at
blood heat, these patients pass a strange
existence. It is not a colorless life, this
aquatic one. Great efforis have been
made to make it bright and full of interest.
As a result, stran c scenes are constantly
being enacted. Life in a tuo would not
strike the casual observer at first thought
a- exhilarating. And yet cold facts prove
that so adapted is humanity 10 its envi
ronment that contentment and even a
â¢vi spirit is compatible with tub
dwelling.
There is precedent for this latter-day
tub life to be found in classical reminders
of the philosophical Diogenes, who also
dwelt in a tub.
The constancy of the treatment is so
iteral that virtually the patient who once
â¢ nter?, unless cured, never leaves his tub.
The visitor to the water-cure department
of th<* Vienna Hospital is abruptly ad
mitted to a chamber of preat size where
are groups of covered bathtub-. Each tub
is occupied by a man or a woman sunk in
water to the chin. There is no lacK of en
terprise or. the part o: these unfortunates
in the way of efforts at self or mutual en
tertainment. It is palpably in the air,
however, that they are all there on busi-
i^ess, the important business ot getting
'â¢veil, and the one first and general prin
file adhered to and enforced by each and
>.ry patient, physician and at'.endant is
keep constantly, so to speak, in soak up
the neck.
Dpon a recent visit to the hospital the
.tubs were obseived to be all occupied, and
the visitor was informed by the bouse sur
geon that there was a waiting list of thir
teen patients, all anxious. The last man
XVBS especially so because of his innate
superstition regarding the to him ominous
chance that had made him number thir
teen. T:;e tub-dwellers, while being ob
served by the visitor referred to were amus
ing themselves by reading, playing musi
cal Instruments and cards and smoking.
One inventive genius had a lutie v,orktable
laid on top of his tub-dwelling, ana with
tools, brass wheels, pulley?, shaft? and
springs was evolving frcm the assortment
â what micbt. be either an eight-day cloct
or an anarchistic bomb-firing machine, or
possibly he was at work on that old ignie
fatuus, which has lured so many â perpet
ual motion.
The Rregariousness of mankind was well
illustrated by the fact that some of the
tubs were grouped so that four wor.ld be,
at their circumference, in touch with each
other, while a few tubs were remote and

dividuals who preferred solitude and self-
communion. One of t lie groups of four
tubs contained a quarter of jovial friend,
whose spirits rould never be dampened,
although their bodies were never dry.
One member of this quartet was a fa:r,
round-faced German woman, presumably
fat and probably over 40. The other
three were men, one of them quite bald,

his experiences were many and often ex
citing. Hardly a glimpse of daylight did
this strange cyclist caicli. He made sixty
five centuries at night, which is in itself
an astonishing performance, but it be
comes all the more so when the fact is

! stained from any of the good things of
i life until they had, possibly as a result of
I hiph living, taken to water as a last re
i sort.
This jolly party was intent on a good
game of pinorhle. They were playing
jvi h the regulation double deck in vogue
with pinochle experts, and exhibited con
siderable finesse in their desperate deter
mination 10 hane on to a jack of diamonds
until the queen of spades came along to
; nelp him count forty, or gamely letting
trick after tricK be taken, with the be
"iruling hope that the one ace needful to
make up the four and score a hundred
would come in the next draw.
The least careful of the quartet of card
players was the jolly German frau, whose
dimpled pink and white and fat bare arms
and shoulders attracted more attention
from the visitors than did the came. It
was evident that she was in more lor the
fun she could get out of it than to be the
first to score a thousand points. Her
cherished score was the number of hearty
laughs which she could evoke and join in.
Every time it came her deal she would
flip and sail the cards so recklessly that
several times one f?llin the water in the
other pluyers' tub?. This did not injure
the cards, it was observed, because they
were possibly a special make, having a
sort of celluloid finish.
There was a pretty general indulgence
in tobacco. A few of the men smoked
pipes, but the general preference was lor
paper-clad ciearettes of Turkish tobacco.
Three men were smoking chibouques, as
if their faith in water was to great that
they wanted their tobacco-smoke bathed.
Among the cigarette-smokers was a young
Spanish woman, whose dark lustrous eyes
and luxuriant glossy black hair, which
was coquettishly arranged, and line fea
tures, all conspired against her com
plexion to make her beautiful. The
otherwise pretty Andalusian's complexion
was exceedingly detrimental, and in fact
she was under treatment for a humor of
tue blood. She was very bright and hope
ful and an attendant said her case was
not chronic. She was regarded by the
colony as transitory and merely amphibi
ous and not as they were, devoted â it
might be for years, it might be foreverâ to
a completely aqueous existence.
An interesting patient v:as a man â a

Mr. Manly lias captured the century and ride by day. As for sleeping, that was
q .ite a secondary matter. What few
: winks he did catch were after or before
j his nightly runs. And here is a strange
| fact. He slept at times on his wheel, he
says. Not as one ordinarily sleeps, with
closed eyes and in a state of complete un
consciousness, but more in a semi-con
scious condition, when the eyes were open
yet saw practically nothing, and the feet
mechanically pushed the pedals around.
His own story of his experiences is as fol
lows:
I"I believe I am the only man in the
orld who ever rode 10,006 miles at night
ithin so short a space of time. My
heeling for the year, consisting of 219
lys of actual riding, lias just ended, and
am happy Ao say that I have won the
century and mileage medals offered by the
Indiana officers of the Century Riding
Club.
"During the day I was busy attending
to business, from which I could not take
the time to ride, so I was obliged to do my
riding at night. I soon became used to
wheeling about in the darkness, and be
fore many nights 1 became so accustomed
to it that I might almost say I preferred
it to riding by daylight.
"It certainly was novel in many respects,
and it has been my experience that dark
ness is no bar to speed. On a road with
which one is any way familiar and with
ever so little moonlight I can ride as fast
as I can durine the day, and on several
occasions I h;ive during my experience as
a night rider made a century in seven
hours, which would as a rule be consid
ered excellent work by day.
"One very peculiar thing in connection
with night riding is that one experiences
certain optical illusions which sometimes
have unique results. The most common
of these illusions is the impression that
one is constantly riding down hill. I
have experienced it so often that I know it
well, and yet I often found myself apply
ing the brake to my machine when speed
ing along a road I knew, if I had thought
about the matter, to be perfectly level.
"At other times when on an unfamiliar
road I have been thinking of something
and on coming to a steep incline the
machine would get away from me and get
half way down the hill before I could get
control of it. This would be due to the
fact that although I saw the incline I gave
it no second thought, but set it down as
the customary illusion until I found my
self going down an actual hill much too
fast for safety or comfort. At other times
1 would find myself pedaling along
mechanically, being practically asleep on
my wheel, and yet having my eyes open
and keeping my balance on the wheel.
"When there iw no moon or it is cloudy,
one has to keep a sharp lookout, or an
ugly fall is apt to result. During my
experience in night riding I tried a dozen
or more different kinds of light but found
none of them satisfactory. They either

A Happy Existence Night and Day in Tubs of Water.
The young Austrian's youth, perfect
health, vigor and determination to sur
vive had made it possible for the water
cure to save him.
Zolnay said in French, which he spoke
like an educated Parisian: "I do not think
I am over sensitive or faint of heart, but I
grew to have such a terror of physical j
pain that my resolution gave way and 1 !
could not bear to have my wounds dressed.
No lint could be made of such gosssmcr
lightness nor oil of such smoothness be I
found that I could endure. The idea of I
being condemned to life in a tub was j
odious, but it was that or death. My
first plunge so irritated my wounds ana

uncertain because of tbe limited area over
which they cast a light.
"iiorses invariably shy at the cycle
lichts at night, and after a number of
trials, I found it much better to ride with
out any light and trust to quick eyes and
a good 3cnse of hearing-
"I tried, of course, to take my runs in
good weather, but sudden storms would
come up, and to be twenty or thirty miles
away from any shelter, on a lonely country
road, at midnignt and get caught in a
lively and fully developed thunder
shower, is not the pieasantest experience
in the world.
"I have had many such experience?, and
in a measure nave got used to them, but
with t lie rain beating down in torrents,
the thunder booming overhead with a
sound as if the very hills were being
toppled over one against the other, and
worst of all the lightning zigzaging about
ones wheel, it is hardly a combination of
circumstances which one wouid choose to
encounter if given any voice in the matter.
"Not only were tnese sudden .'bowers
disagreeable in themselves, but, aside
from the drenchinc, the rain would leave
the roads in such a muddy condition that
getting tiome was the hardest kind of
work.
"Dogs were another fruitful source of
annoyance to me during my night runs.
They seemed to naturally infer that I had
evil intentions upon the property of Their
owners, and on more than one occasion I
had to stop, dismount and give battle to
some ugly canine, taking as a weapon the
first club, fence rail or anything which I
couM lay my hands on.
"The owners always tooK the part of the
dog until after matters were explained, and
then, with some flattering remark gener

would go scorching about t c country on
a bicycle at midnight, would lead the dis
appointed dog away, while I would con
tinue on my way.
"The particularly pleasant features of
nic'n riding are the perfect rest and quiet
of the country, and when the moon is
bright the Jight throws a weird aspect
about the most ordinary object. The long
stretches of country road reach out far
ahead into the gloom of the night, while
the cool breezes which always rise after
the set of sun make riding delightful.

its yielding softness seems like heaven in

Beside its towering height full-grown
men look like pigmies. Its strength is so
prodigious that it can only be understood
when it is stated that it would require the
combined strength of several regiments of
men to hold this iron monster, once steam
was up and the throttle thrown open.
This big engine was built for the Buf
falo, Rochester and Pittsbure Railroad
and when in service will be what railroad
men call-a "pusher."
There is a particularly heavy grade on
this line, in the coal regions near Mount
Jewett, and it is here that the services of
this giant engine will be required, to help
the regular engines up the grade with
loaded coal trains.
New Monster Engine That Has Created a Sensation.
This new grade conqueror's number is
139 and as she stands in the Buffalo yards
of the road she is constantly the center of
an admiring throng who never tire of dis
cussing the huge machine from all points
of view.
This same engine has since making its
debut attracted a great deal of attent.on

Zolnay was an ardent musician. As a
student he had been a devoted pianist,
but had always played the violin, and
*ince his immersion has been able to U"-e
bis arms sufficiently to take up again his
beloved violin. He, without excuse,
played several selections when askedâ
one exquisite one, solemn and tender,
irom Mozart, and some Hungarian music.
He played qne wnllz, and the German

to the great amusement of every one.
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon luncheon
is served to the bathers. Their breakfast
in most cases is very light cereals with
fruit nguring'largely in the simple meuu.
Those whose ills are not incidental to the
quality of the blood enjoy coffee. The
lunchfon was a more imposing affair.
Its menu comprised about the dishes
which might be served at a good hotel,
excepting that well-demonstrated rules
for hygienic pabulum were observed. The
patients were unrestricted in their de
sires excepting by the dictum of the doc
tors and the limits of their private purses.
The tables were Hat boards laid across
the tops of the circular tubs. The boards
were neatly covered with white oilcloth.
Light sour wines were in favor as bever
ages, but these in most cases were con
siderably diluted, and it wa3 noticeable
that the patients were inclined to drink a
good deal, to some extent as one is when
in a Turkish bath. One of the trifling in
cidents of life which it was demonstrated
could be made unusually annoying under
peculiar circumstances was when a bather
accidentally knocked nis salt-cellar into
his tub. He instantly disappeared be
neath the surface and quickly recovered
the bottle; 'out most of his salt was in the
tub in solution, the water having entered
the perforations of the salt-ceilar's metal
top.
One of the most inexplicable and inter
esting phases of tub-life to the visitor is
the sleeping of patients. "Great heavens!"
said an American girl visitor, who was al
most startled out of her propriety when
ihis matter was referred to. "I didn't
suppose for a moment that they slept in
there, too."
But tbey do. The faculty of going to
sleep in the water is not inherent with
humanity. It can be acquired. The
novice when he tries it is for several
nights Â« victim to wearisome insomnia,
bin at last tired nature acknowledses her
need of the sweet restorer, and tne new
bather succumbs, only to be suddenly
4 feet BVÂ£ inches gauge. The total wheel j
base of the engine is 20 feet 5 inches, which
means that its wheels stand on a space 'â 
loneer than the width of a fall city lot.
The d riving- wiieel base is 15 feet 6 inches.
The total wheel base of engine and tender j
is 52 fee: 9 inches, while the total length i
of engine and tender over all is over 60 j
feet.
This engine Is a giant, and would in
carrying out the idea of symmetrical pro
portion have been taller than it is but for
the numerous obstacles, like the roofs of
tunnels and bridges, which a locomotive
while traveling is likely to encounter. It |
is cheaper to foreshorten the stacks of
locomotives than to incur expense for ex- j
tra rockwork in tunneling and for buf.d- j
ing higher aDutnients and approaches for j
wagon-road bridges.
The top of 139's stack is \i\i feet from j
the tops of the rails over which the mon
ster runs. From the rails to the center of
the boiler the distance is 8 feet 9V 2 ' inches,
and when a man of ordinary height stands
beside the enjjine the height looks even
greater.
The boiler is of the type known to loco
motive-builders as the Belpaire Wagon
top. Its diameter at its smallest ring is 5
feet 8 inches. Its crown is supported by
direct stays. The stay-bolts are 1 inch in
diameter and are spaced not over Ay s
inches from center to center. The whole
was made with most scrupulous care.
A man crawling in the manhole ot
the boiler would see what resembles a
giant mitrailleuse composed of 324
tubes 2 inches in diameter. Ti:e length of
these tubes over the tubesheet is 12 feet
7 5-16 inches. The heating surface af
fected by the tubes amounts to 2120 square
feet.
Powerful cylinders are those beside the
Mogul's boiler. The diameter of each is
21 inches and the stroke 26 inches. The
piston-rods are each 4 inches in diameter,

The story has been printed that Benja
min Franklin, who. in his youth, was
fond of natatorial sport* and accustomed
to floating a great doal on his back, once
fell asleep on the surface of still water,
and so remained for perhaps an hour.
Many constant bathers know that- they
can easily reach the point of falling asleep
while afloat, and even doze off into un
consciousness for a few moments, until
the lapping of a wavelet on iheir lips sig
nals danger, with the result of a sudden
awakening
The tub-dwellers have on the floor of
their watery habitations a flexible wooden
lattice, covered with blankets and sup
plied with rubber pillows. Thereon rests
that trifling portion of the weight of the
patient's body that is not sustained by the
water. At night when tne few electric
lights burn dim all is silent in the baths
of Hebra save for an occasional snore,
stertorous breathing or the soft splÂ«sh of
the arm of an uneasy sleeper changing his
or her position.
The effect of the unremitting soaking of
the human body is manifested very mod
erately so far as concerns external and
suDerfieial appearances. Tne structure
and organs of the body do not suffer or
change. Even the skin shows small signs
excepting upon the palms of the hands
and soles of the feet. There the skin be
comes shriveled, puffed and bloodless like
the hands of a hard worked washer
woman. When pain is caused a little oil
soon relieves it. In some cases about the
arms and shoulder?, where the skin is out
of and in the water alternately, the soak
ing produces a miid form of paDular
eczema.
Three times daily in ordinary cases the
whole contents of the tubs, which are
cooper lined, are changed. A small in
flowing stream of warm water suffices to
maintain the temperature at from 95 to 97
decrees Fahrenheit. The surplus water
runs off tlirongh an overflow pipe.
The diseases am- nable to this treatment
are chiefly those where there is a consid
erable loss of integument, as in distress
ing bedsores, forms of gangrene, univeral
exfoliating pemphigns.extensive burns and
wounds involving great loss of skin. The
diseased part, through constant immer
sion, is relieved of the weight of the body,
and frequent painfui dressings can De dis

In the case of severe burns, snch as the
young hero Zolnay's, the tub life is sim-
ply a gcdsend. The sufferer in such a
case cannot assume any position thattloca
not cause unspeakable agony from the
pressure upon the burned surface. The
relief of the bath is so marked that lives
which otherwise would be lost because of
shock and suffering are saved and health,
eventually restored.
When they die in the tub these suffer
ers can thank the Creator for the good
thoughts of the ingenious inventors of tho
baths of Hebra, as they are called, who
have by this simple use of water made
possible a new, long, comfortable and even
happy life, even thougu it be spent and
sometimes ended in a tub, of some of
Europe's otherwise greatest sufferers.

The total heating surface is 2306 square

J-ioW a Bravte Boy Conquered and
SleW the Qiarxt of White Hill.
BY EDGAB PENFIELD.
(Concluded.)
The boy, however, refused this courtesy,
telling ttem of his vow not to rest three
days till he had found his three sisters.
The next morning, as he was going out,
the ram gave a small piece of his wool to
his wife's b other, saying:
"When you are in need of help, call on
all the rams of the earth, and this will
bring them to you."
Vvith hi 3 cap of darkness on, the boy
sped away, and at noon reached the house
of Bright One. This palace was all of
silver, and his sister took him in just as
Fair One had. Everything shone with the
white silver light, just as the sun is white
at noonday.
In the evenin g the Bright One's husband
came home like an immense salmon, and
went flapping up the stairs. Soon ne
came down as a tine-looking man, clad in
cloth of silver, and welcomed the Sunny
One.
Here the boy was entertained as he had
been the previous day at his first sister's
home, and in the morning, when he de
parted, the salmon gave him a piece of his
fin, saying:
"When you are in need call on all the
salmon in the sea and tney will aid
you."
Then the boy went on, wearing his cap
of darkness. By noontime he was very
hungry, so he took off his cap, spread his
scarf upon the ground, and immediately a
sumptuous repast was before him. "When
he had eaten he again went on, and at
iwiligut came to the abode of his third
sister.
"800-HOO! IT'S ALL GONE!"
Here all was copper-colored but beauti
ful as the dusk of evening, l'olished parts
of the wall shone out like star 3in the
evening sky. His sister was clothed in
soft, filmy robes like the clouds at sunset.
Suddenly a great wind rushed throuch the
place, and Sunny One saw an immense
eagle fly up the staircase. Soon afterward
his sisters husband came down and wel
comed him.
As he had found all three of his sisters
the boy might now have rested, but the
next morning as ne looked over the sea
from the summer-bower he saw a white
hill in the midst of the wave?. His s-ister
saw where he was looking, and said:
"Alas! my brother, a sad story comes
to us from over the sea! In the castle on
that white hill lives a giant, wno has
stolen from her home the most beautiful
woman in the world. Princes and cham
pions come to combat with him, but he
kills them all, takes their heads off and
eats their flesh. The bones he throws out,
and it is that which makes the hill white.
No man can kill him, and he it is that has
enchanted my Husband and my sisters'
husbands."
''I will go and kill him," cried Sunny
One, "and the maiden I shall free and
bring hither."
As he was going, the eagle cave him a
feather, saying:
"When you are in need, call on all the
eagles of the air and they will help you."
So, donning his cap of darkness, the
youth departed and soon fcund himself
in the palace on the white hill. Outside
the walis the giant was lighting with the
champions and the princes.
Sunny One took off his cap and showed
I himself to the beautiful maiden. She
wept to thing of his death and said there
could be no escape for him.
"Do not fear for me," the youth said.
"I will conceal myself; only, beware of
telling him that I am here."
At that moment they heard the giant !
coming, and, quickly putting on his cap !
of darkness. Sunny One waited. The |
ogre came in, carrying two dead princes, I
and when he had thrown the bodies
down he commanded the maiden to cook
them.
"A man is here," he thundared. "I
smell his flesh and blood!"
"I can see no one," the trembling girl
replied.
"Nor can I; but he is here!"
Just then Sunny One struck the giant
with his sword of sharpness, and with a
howl of pain and rage the giant leaped in
his direction, but could strike no one, for
at the same moment he received a blow
on the side. So they fought till the giant
had fifty wounds ana not once had he
struck Sunny One, for the cap completely
hid him from view.
""Whoever you are, cease your fighting,"
the giant at last cried out, "and I will
meet you in the morning acain."
So Sunny One stopped and the maiden,
pretending to be sorry, wept and dressed
the wounds of the giant.
Ld the morning he was well again and
he and Sunny One fought as before till
nearly night, when again the giant called
for a respite.
Then the maiden wept even m^re bit
terly.
"Ah, me," she cried, "what will become
of me? You will be killed, and h/>w shall
I live here alone?"
"I see you are sorry," answered the
giant, "and would do all you can for me.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 1897.
Now, listen; no one can kill me till be
performs an impossible task. Know that
in the sea is a great chest, sealed and
bound. In the chest is a duck and in the
I duck an egg. No one can kill me till he
' strikes with that ege, a mark I have on
jmy right side. So be comforted, for I fear
no onÂ«, for no one knows my secret, much
less could he get the egg."
While he said all this, there stood Sunny
One, in his cap of darkness and heard
every word. Then the youth thought of
the saimon, and rushing to the seashore
he took out the tin and cried out:
"I want the salmon in the sea to bring
the bound chest containing the duck to
me."
Soon the sea was full of salmon, swim
ming toward tha land, and they laid tho
i chest at the boy's feet. But it was so
strongly bound that he could not open it.
Talcing out the wool he said:
"Lei all the rams of the earth come here
| and open this chest for me."
lo an instant herd upon herd of rams
came dashing to the shore, each with tre
mendous horns upon his bead, and dash
j ing them against the chest they broke it
i open, and out flew the duck over the sea.
Quickly the Sunny One took out the
I eagle's feather and cried:
"All the eagles of the air come to my
aid, and bring to me the egg from out of
the duck."
In almost the twinkling of an eye the
duck was surrounded by all the eagles of
the air, and the boy soon had the egg in
his hand.
Then he donned his cap again and was
in the castle in a second. Asain ho fought
with the giant, and when the maiden
bathed the latter's wounds she raised his
right arm. Quick as a flash the boy threw
the egg at the mark, and at that moment
the giant died.
Then, gathering all the treasures of
cold and precious stones together, the boy
set out with the maiden for the home of
his sister Gentle One. There he returned
the feather to the eajjle. who immediately
regained his proper form, for now the
enchantment was ended.
Then bunny One and the maiden trav
eled to the homes of the other sisters,
where both the salmon and the ram re
gained their own forms on receiving back
the tin and the wool.
.\fter spending several days with each
sister, the two set out on their homeward
journey, and soon came up from the hole
in the ground to the mossy rock by the
brook. The Sunny One called the dwarf,
and having spread the cloth of plenty they
had a great feast. When it was over
Sunny O.ie returned bis gifts to the dwarf,
who straightway stood before them a hand
some prince.
"I am brother to the ram, the salmon
and the eagle," he said, "and you have
freed us all by killing the Giant of White
Hill. Now I will reward you."
Then he stamped his foot upon the
ground, and there appeared a beautiful
marble palace, with birds and flowers and
fountains and all wonderful thines inside.
But the prince had disappeared. There
the young people were married and lived
happily, the oid mother and father of
Sunny One with them.

A little bark sailed down a stream
That rippied sweetly by,
Through sunny lauds that ever gleam
To gladden heart and eye.
From greenwood bank as on It passed,
And every fragrant spot,
Came odors fair as ea;ri one cast
Its sweet forge t-me-uot.
O what a wealth of precious flowers,

Were garnered in those morning hours
Of golden-tinted light.
New filled with fondest dreams, love's own,
That blesses trusting youth,
Tlie bark sails on with all we've known

Abe's Good Luck.
"See heah, youse Chilian, aat am de
las' bit ob cake youse can hab 'til suppo;
now, g'long," and with that final ejacula
tion old Aunt Dinah waved the pillbox
threateningly at Amy and Dorothy, who
had just helped themselves to two slices
of cake from the plate on the table.
The little girls left the kitchen and went
out on the shady porch : then they wan
dered through the carden out to the broad
carriage-way, munching their cake and
laughing to themselves as they thought of
how they always managed to get tne best
of dear Aunt Dinah.
As they turned a corner they saw old
| Abe Jackson coming toward them, swing
j ins; his empty lunch-bucket. When be
| drew near the girls he stopped, with long
! ing looks at the delicious cake, which -was
j ainiost gone.
"Huh," he said, with a grunt, "Youse
I two gais ain't got the sense of Aunt Ui
nah's old turkey gobbler!"
The little girl* stopped eating their cake
and opened their eyes in astonishment
when they heard these words. Abe en
joyed this and continued: "Don you'se
know dat instead of habin' just two little
pieces of cake you might jes as well hab a
whole tree full, wid pies and oranges
trone in ?"
"How, Uncle Abe, how?" exclaimed and
questioned botn Dorothy and Amy, tneir
breatn almost taken away by this glorious
news.
"Shu ting; no jokin 1 ," said Abe sol
emnly.
'Piease tell us, Abe."
"Wall, misses, you jes' get a clean piece
ob paper and two nior' big slices of dat ar'
cream cake and lay dem undan dat tree
obah yondah, and afore bery long you go
pas' dat place, and sbu's you're born youse
'ill hab all de goodies you dun want."
The girls looked at the remains of the
cake in their hands.
"Won't these pieces do, Uncle Abe?"
Amy asked. "Aunt Dinah said we were
not to have any more till supper time."
"Naw," answered Abe; "dey'd neberdo
in de won' ! Not 't all, not 't all !" and he
turned his back on the two, as if disgusted
with the very idea.
What should they do? and what could
they do? After pondering for a while
Amy ventured to make this remark:
"Oh, Dorothy, if you would give me a
boost I could climb up ttie peach tree and
get Into the. pantry through the window."
"Good!" cried Dorothy. "Just the
thing!"
So they ran quickly to the old peach
tree, which had stood for years by the
house, and whose great gnarled brunches
contained many a cozy seat.
A little help from Dorothy and Amy
was up, stepping from branch to branch
uniil right by the pantry window. From
her perch she could easily see the deli
cious cake piied in the pretty basket all
ready to grace the supper table.
Over she stepped, then jumped to the
floor. Quickly selecting two of the very
largest slices, and wrapping them in a
dainty white napkin, she climbed out
again ea fast as she could, keeping as
quiet all the time as possible.
Oh, how frightened she was that Aunt
Dinah, whom she could hear snoring in the
kitchen, might awaken, but she didn't,
and Amy was soon safe in the tree.
Then s-he tied the four corners together
around the precious cake. "Untying her

It to the bundle, and then slowly let it
descend to Dorothy, who was anxiously
waiting below.
Dorothy caught it safely, and Amy
jumped down from the tree.
When they took the cake to Abe he
smiled approvingly and said: "Dal will
do, little misses. I'll do the rest; trust
old Abe for dat. Youse better go to de
house now ana don look behind youse.''
The children, fearful of breaking the
charm, proceeded to obey him.
As soon as their backs were turned the
sly old negro slipped the napkin of cake
into his pocket and went whistling to his
little cabin.
In the evening there was trouble in the
big house, Aunt Dinab scolding over the
missing cake, venting her wrath rirst on
"those good-for-nothin' chil'ren" and then
blaming in strong terms that "old, lazy
boned nigger, Abe Jackson."
Poor Amy and Dorothy wore shut up in
the gnrret until papa should come home
and hear ail about their naughtiness,
while down in his cabin oM Abe chuckled
over his good fortune in having 'Mat fine

A Dolls' Party.

an excursion to see the mountains in mid
winter. It was of course difficult to hnd a

hotel open, but at length they did come
upon one which was in condition to re
ceive them. There they stayed three days,
snowshoeing, gazing at the wonders of
sky and mountains, and renewing delignt
ful acquaintanceship. The last day of
their stay, however, it snowed, and when
the forenoon was three-quarters gone the
party wondered for the first time what they
should do next.
Dinner-time solved the riddle, for on
each plate lay a little note, addressed in
pencil and a childish hand, to the first
name of the person for whom it was in
tended. A learned Judge was called
"Sammy," a dignified matron "Nellie":
the writer was evidently no respecter of
The notes were alf alike within. They
were printed as a child of five years might
print and they all ran thus:
"My mrcmrna wants to know if yo;ir
mamma will let you come and play with
me this afternoon in the parlor. Bring
your dolly."
There were looks of surprise, and then
shouts of laughter. Evidently this was to
be a dolls' party. Very little discussion of
the scheme followed, but after dinner,
everybody hurried upstairs to the bed
chambers, where much whispered consul
tation must have taken place, and some
careful work.
At four, men and women were punctu
ally at the parlor door, where they were
received by the perpetrator of the joke, a
stout schoolteacher, bearing a large china
doll, which she had borrowed 01 the land
lord's little girl.
Then wjiat peals of laughter there were!
These grown-up children had- all come,
and had obediently brought their dollies.
The learned judge bore a dried herring,
dressed in tissue paper, and bis wife dan
dled a beautiful creature made entirely of
vegetables. It had a potato ior a head,
surmounted by half a lemon for a cap.
Beneath this, escaped tendrils of hair
made from the dried clematis in the parlor
vases. Its body was formed of another
potato, covered with a corn-husk shawl,
and its skirt was of curly carrot tops. A
necklace of driod berries completed its
rare and original costume.
The two cats of the house, one maltese
and the other jet black, had been dressed
in white petticoats and cap. Both were
indignant, injured, absurd, and the black
one especially looked like the wolf that
Red Riding Hood found in grandmother's
bed. The family dog, a fat brown
spaniel, had been put into a little girl's
sacque and petticoat, and allowed himself
to be borne in, paws upward, by a muscu
lar young man.
Rag dolls there were in abundance, and
several enormous ones made of pillows
demanded all the care of their fond main"
mas. Most peculiar of all was a little
Grecian godde3s, dating back into the
iirst centuries before Christ, which a gaunt
professor had brought with him, hoping
to use it in illustration of a little talk on
ancient Greece, and which he bore about

but I shall write now, hoping 10 see my letter
in print.
I must tell you of a day last summer when
some of my schoolmates, my sisters and I went
into the woods, which surround our little
town, on a picnic. We had a glorious time. I
furnished Dickies, apples and water, and the
rest of the girls supplied bread, meat, cake
mid cups. Picking flowers and ferns, running
races, eating, telling stories and^ giving rid
dles was the way we passed the hours of that
bright day, and the timu for ourreturn home
arrived only too soon. When we reached my
papa's house, it being the nearest to our picnic
ground, my friends stopped and passed an
other pleasant hour looking at picture-books,
playing games and singing songs. By and by
the girls went home and my sisters and I ar
ranged the flowers and ferns we had gathered,
which keDi us busy until mamma called us for
supper. Often since in conversation we have
recalled one or another incident of that day
in the woods, where, left entirely to our own
resources, we enjoyed so much the beauty of
our mountain scenery and the pine- perfumed
air of our grand old forests. Your little

and now runs the engine.

The great eminence achieved by Tyler is i

sibly be any greater joy to a boy than to

probably astounded wnen for the first time

Nevertheless these railway magnates to a

of the insignificant lines are the least

As a matter of fact, Tyler since the first

that he is to be made the recipient of one

It was manifest that profit as well as
fan awaited the success of a miniature
railroad running over Bucks Hi.l. Trier,
who went to work at it in a very crude,

his eiders to have faith in him as a civil

best adapted to steam launches and s:i;ali
motors, using ihe gear ordinarily used fur j
such purposes. Tyler's levers, conrec
tiooi, brake?, tte exposure of his boiler j
and machinery and his primitive coal
bunkers all wear an e.lr of crudity. The
boy's sensible aim was to save ar.d make !

l^iLj* Dominic near King Williams
Town, Cape Colony, South Africa Nuns
as blacksmiths represent the new woman
in a brand-new character. This news of
their novel departure will be received with
: a great deal of interest.
It wouli seem that the new woman
after having conquered all else aa a female
invadtd the cloister. There is small en
couragement for the aggressive innova
tions of new womanhood amid tne tradi
tions and diurnal routine of a convent.
The exigencies of existence in a new land
â¢ which confronted the Sisters of S. Dom
inic in South Africa they boldly met in
j stead of yielding to. Men were scarce
i and indifferent to mechanics' wages in a
quiet sett. err.ent when the glitter of the
golden Transvaal and the alluring dia
monds of the Kirnberly beckoned to them
from beyond. The nuns therefore took
up the sledgehammer, hung their weight
upon the bellows, and merrily flew the
sparks from the cherry red metal which
was to shoe the settler's waiting steed.
The Sisters of St. Dominic with full faith
in their mission to soften existence ana
sow religious seed in the South African
region turned their backs on the time-
honored customs and humdrum convent
life oi Europe and established this, tneir
new settlement near King Williams
Town, Cape Colony. Their nrst moTe was
to purchase the roost extensive farm in
the market. Quickly the nuns discovered
that farm laborers were so scarce that it
was impossible to get a sufficient number
or to retain and rely on the few they could
secure. Land without labor proved un
profitable, and the tows of their order
c mrelled their seif-maintenance. And so
the nuns quietly put their hands to the
plow. Bui accidents will happen, and in
time t c plowshare was broken.
Tnere were no blacksmiths, so the nuns
sent to Cape Town and had shipped to
them the maerials to build aud tne tcols

flesh. Small as the investment was for
the whole property, the ratio of operating
expense is very light.
In running the line the boy surveyor I
humored the topography of the region
With which he had to deal and did not j
contract for any deep cuts or for any rock I
and implements to conduct a smithy. A
blacksmith as a tutor was secured. This
wns six months ago, ana now the nuns
have just begun to do their own black
smithing. They have thus proved not
only their equality with man, but their
superiority to him, because when the
blacksmith, disregarding his religious en
vironment and the re-pect due to the
noble women, went on a prolonged drunk
he was incontinently "fired" out of the
settlement.
The Dominican farm is one of thÂ« most
attractive sights of the Cape Colony. Its
management, for system and intelligence,
is unsurpassed.
In a comparatively new country such
! attention to detaila as the sisters eive to
i their agricultnral operations seem to their
j slow-going Boer neighbors a work of su
j pereroeacion, to the English it appears
1 too finicky, and to the native Kalfar and
i Hoitentot helpers it seems akin to the
; miraculous, and fills ih^ra with awe.
T.ie visitor who rides to tne farm from
King William-* Town before he reaches
ihe confines of the Dominican domain be
holds from a distance brown-ciad feminine
figures hoeing, plowing, cultivating, prun
ing a"nd grafting in the orchards, or per
haps a nun mounted on a horse driving
j strong-limbed oxen to water. At close
! range th* most incongruous thing in the
appearance of a Si-ter of St. Dominic as
she is on her South African farm is her
ruddy, rosy, tannea face, so different from
the bloodless white face that seems insep
arable from the visible character of a nun.
This natural bronze was well earned.
Day after day the nuns have toiled at the
forge and in the fields, ami exposure to
the fierce African sun has gradually
changed them from pale-faced, delicate
handed convent women to brawny, hard
handed laborers.
But the feminine blacksmiths of the
Dominican Convent farm are the stars.
Tne personality and expertness of the
hammer-swinging nun ever seems to con
tinue to exercise a sort of fascination over
the rest of the sisterhood, for they go out
of their way while about their daily tasks
on the farm to look In, even if but for a
moment, at their hard-working sisters.
A recent visitor to the Si >tÂ«rs of St. Domi
nic, who had the good fortune to possess a
letter of introduction from a Bishop to
the mother superior, entered the occasion
of his visit as a red-letter day in his diary.
The abbess proved to be a woman endowed
with uncommonly good sense. She was
practical and her personal spirituality wa3
so aided and tempered with a knowledge
of human nature and an ability to per
ceive the humorous side of things that she
captivated the visuor. Nevertheless, she
imbued him with deep respect for her un
derlying and indefeasible deterruinatiou
to serve God by doing good to her fellow
mortaia.
After a drive about the farm in a species
of buck wagon behind a spirited stockily
built young horse upon a tour of inspec
tion of mines, fruit trees and growing
crops and an occasional chat with some
Sister, perhaps leaning lightly and pic
turesquely on a hoe, the abbess remarked,
"Now, I suppose you will not be willing
to conclude your inspection without visit
ing our *>! ..cismith-shop."
The revelation as to the enlargement of
woman's sphere to the extent of including
blackimithing wÂ»s, in one instance at
least, startling. Tethered to a strong
oaken rack in the center of the shop was a
draughthorse, whose big bones and
shaggy fetlocks proclaimed a Flemish
â¢train in his blood. Nail box beside he:,
a nun war bent over, with % the horse's
"nigh" hind foot over her Knee, and with
a redhot horseshoe heid with a pair of
tongs was tilting the shoe to the hoof.
The abbess faintly smiled at the uncon
cealed startling effect created on tbe vis
itor, and the uun just then dropping the
wort. The stony, raveliy sur.ace was
easily converted into a solid roadbed.
The rails used were of steel, T-sbapftd,
and the lightest rails made of this de
scription, weighing but eight pounds to
the yard. The cross ties were of chest
nut, 33-s feet long. 4 inches face and 3
inches thick. The gause is 26 inches.
The grade, as before stated, in its steepest
part is 370 feet to the m:!e. The whole
cost of constructing the railway was at
the rate of $600 per mile.
. The exigencies of Tyler's railroad build
ing did not compel any bridge-building
enterprise, as there were no intervening
valleys between the termini of the road
that could not be rounded at their heads,
and the only structures necessary were a
few low tunnels.
President-Engineer Tyler sees 1897 open
up with bright auspices. No disgruntled
| stockholders are clamoring for a receiver
I or reorganization, and no Joca: Debs is
i encouraging the engineer to go on strike
contrary to the desires of the presi
dent.
Tne future of the road seems fair and,
encourajred by the success of this boyish
experience, Tyler can well hope to figure
yet in tiie field of railroad building in all
Us American magnificence.
hufre hoof closed up the glowing shoe a
little more around the horn of the anvil.
Presently, with a few strokes from a help
foJ sister, the shoe was completed.
The abbess remarked that this nun, Sis
ter Joanna, who was in charge of the
blacksmi; h-shop, was interested in her
new /ocation to the extent that she never
appeared to even notice the many curious
visitors, who, forgetting all roliteness,
stared at her as though she was a newly
discovered species.
Sister Joanna, the mother superior said,
was a great reader, and managed to rind
time after a ten-hour day of hard physi-
cal toil, besides perusing the lives of the
saints and martyrs and attending to the
convent's reiieious routine, to read poetry.
Schiller and Goethe were among her prime
favorites.
Sister Joanna's intellectuality told in
her work, for she had a copy of an English
work entitled "The Complete and Compe
tent Farrier," and two works on tbe
anatomy of tbe horse. In addition to her
b.acksmitbing Sis'.er Joanna was the
acknowledged veterinary of the Sisters'
farm, which boasted of over a score of
valuable iiorses and a dozen yoke of oxen.
This Girl Is a Fire-Fighter
LoVes Flame and Smoke, and Dressed ir\

Hands, She Is an Inspir
ing Spectacle
i awful forebodings of enemies of
â pi Sj the new woman that she would
JiL^ take to fighting rires has come true.
: Here is a fire- woman.
il ss Lillian Brown of Greensboro, N. C. ,
I i? her name and address. She has been
I officially adopted by the North Carolina
; State Firemen's Association. He- favorite
i fathers, of which sac as. a daughter has
over a thousand, are in Greensboro, where
she was first r dopted by the Eagle Hose
Company, every man of wbich is as
proud of his adopted daughter as if slie
were a queen. Never a fire occurs with
out the nrercen's daughter being on the
scene, and to see her, dressed in red flan
nel fire cothes, helmeted, and with an ax
in her dainiy bands, as she urjzes the
"boys" on to conquer iheir blazing foe, is
| a sight to remind one of the heroic acts of
j Joan d'Arc.
There is not a single thing in the science
of fire fighting that Miss Brown does not
know, and her quick eye grasps the situa
tion of a blaze in a second. As soon as
she sees the flames she knows exactly
which way they will spread, and in an
instant she realizes the point which should
be first attacked.
There is a curious train of circumstances
leading up to the adoption of Miss Brown
by the fire boys. SbÂ« was born in Fair
field, N. C. Her first appearance in
Greensboro was about three and a half
years ago, when she entered the female
college there. It so happened that, being
of a bright turn of mind, she was assigned
to play the leading role in the drama,
"The Firemrn's Heart," at the college
students' annual performance. The play
was produced at the Bogart Opera-house,
and was a tren-endous success. A*
Hyacinth Bradley, the pet an i "Mascot"
of the firemen, Miss Brown literally cap
tured every heart in the audience, and
I especially those of the fire boys. Soon
j af:er this, at the regular monthly meet
| ing of the Eagle Hose Company Miss
Brown was formally adopted as the Bre
men's daughter, and her name was placed
j upon the honorary roll of the company's
j membersiiip.
The new fire girl gracefully accepted the
Honor thu3 conferred upon her, and
pledged herseif to advance the cause of
firemen In general and especially the in
terest of her new-made fathers, the Eagles.
Miss Brown carried off the honors with a
ruodesi bearing, and soon her fame spread
to different parts of the State. Town after
town wanted to have her for its adopted
daughter, and many meetings were cal.ed
to consider the subject. All difficulties
were finally surmounted at the meeting of
the Sta'.e Firemen's Association, when by
a unanimous vote the pet of the Greens
boro boys was made a daughter of the
State association.
This is the only case on record of a girl
being connected with afire department,
and the honor is felt to be as great by the
har-ly life-?avers as it is by Miss Brown
herself. Already the "daughter of the
company" Doasss two medals for bravery
displayed at fires, and several resolutions
have been passed and sent to her by dif
ferent bodies of citizens who owe to her
plucky worK many thousand? of dollars.
The North Carolina boys have always been
considered a brave set of men, but their
energies are redoubled whenever the eye
of ttreir daughter is on them.
Lillian Brown, the Fire-Fighter*
Miss Brown takes the greatest possible
interest in the department. She has a
call in her house connected with the gen
eral signal system, and knows every num
ber practically by heart. It is a very
rare occurrence when she is late on tne
scene of a blaze, for do matter what time
it is when her fire gong sounds the alarm
Miss Brown dons her clothes and starts
off to help ncr fathers.
Many oi them have reason to bless her
for her kindly help, especially after some
unfortunate accident; or the little jjirl is
very ready to nurse the sick and injured,
and is always prepared for such emergen
c;es. Indeed, these savers of liie and
property have much to be proud of in
their daughter. She ifl extremeiy pretty.
Her eyes are dark and fawn-like, while
htr naturally well-rounded features are
still further softened by a mass of waving
chestnut hair, which the little tire girl
wears parted loosely in the center and
drawn over her tiny ears, cau.Tlu ud at
the back of her head by a plain black
velvet band.
At every social function in Greensboro
Miss Brown is the centei of attraction, and
it is pleasing to record that the natural
jealousy which it nsigcit be imagined her
popularity would give rise to is entirely
absent amons both maids and matrons
alike. The little girl is looked upon a-s a
sort of ministering angel, and indeed her
many deeds of kindnet-s stand responsible
sponsors for her at ieast "State-wide"
reDUtaton.
The boys of the Eaela Hose Company
are of course delighted that their chosen
daughter should have become so popular,
and a movement has now been started
which, if carried into effect, will see the
brave and quaint youne woman the
adopted daughter of the National Fire
men's Association. The Greensboro boys
are confident that it is only necessary for
trie firemen of other States to become ac
quainted with Miss Brown's poodne.-s and
ability in order to make them also ansious
to adopt her as their official child.

A graphic story is told of Surgeon-
Captain Grey, one of the officers who
served in Rhodesia. In the attack on Ma
shangombi the horses be^an to drop, and
soon thirteen lay on the ground, and it
looked as if the men would ail be killed.
.Evidently Captain Turner thought so, tor
fie virtually gave tne order, "Sauve gui
peut," telling every man to fisht the best
he could for his own l.and. But though
the horses continued to fall the men es
caped. Dr. Grey, to use his own words,
"led toward the way out under a raking
fire at a gallop, and was closely followed
by the troop,' according to the St. James
Budget. "Very soon, however, I fell from
the saddle, struck witfi a bullet from an ele
phant gun, about 500 yards off. The bullet
struck me on the top of the thigh, smash
ing the socket of the thigh bone, breaking
a vein and otherwise wounding me. My
horse was carried along at high speed with
the rear guard, which rushed at desperate
speed to clear the pocket-like entrance of
the drift where the natives were rallying
in the hope of killing us. As I lay on the
grass, bleeding profusely, I looked up and
saw two natives aiming at me at a dis
tance of about forty feet. At the same
moment I saw my horse come thundering
back from the drift. It suddenly stopped
and stood over my prostrate bocty, covering
me from the firing and at the same time
making a peculiar noise through its nos
trils. I thought it had been wounded,
and that witb the pain, noise and coniu
'â¢ion it had gone mad. This notion, how
ever, was soon dispelled, for it continued to
stand over me in a knee;ing posture, and
I could see that the faithful animal had
come back to protect me. I may remark
here that this horse, which I myself se
lected. I had made a pet of. The assegais
I from the approaching ' natives were now
; beginning. to fly around rue. and, thinking
if I could reach my horse's back I would
be shot, which was preferable to being
j assegaied, I seized the reins, put ray
! right foot in the stirrup and made a
supreme effort to mount. And I was
: successful, .bat how Id it Ido not know,
! for my left- side was entirely, paralyzed.
! On finding myself in my saddle I called
j 'Go !' to my hor*e, which darted like aa
* arrow toward the exit from the drift."

THE
STAGE
The Nordica - Pcaichi combination
swamped everything theatrical last week.
To read the majority of U a press notices
one would have imagined that the Pan
Francisco critics had been languishing to
prostrate themselves at the altar of pood
Bintring, that they iiad never heard any
before and never hope.! to hear any again,
and intended to worship with a will
while the objects of adoration were with
them. Of course it is very chisrming to
pee talent recognized in this ecstatic way,
but to mo there is a flavor of provincial
ism in going into indiscriminate extrava
gmceover everything, good, bad and in
ii.fferent, and in. the performances at the
Baldwin last week there were one or two
miles that were undeniably badâ the
tenor's falsetto notes, for instance.
I do not for a moment want to disparage
the Nordca - Scalchi combination, for
their concerts have been a rare trpat, and
if we had divas such as Nordica and
Scalchi with us of tener it would be to our
educational advantage, for, as a com
munity, we are much given to sieging.
First and foremost in interest to my mind
comes Scaichi, because, in spite of wear
an 1 tear, see remains that rara avi> â a
real contralto. She came into the world
before it was the fashion to manufacture
contraltos at so much an hour. They are
turned out now as rapidly as machine
made hand-organs, and are as weird and
repulsive as most other monstrosities.
But what does that matter to them or the
masters who make them? In the dearth
of real rontraltos they supply a long-felt
â want, and win money and applause, when
in realityâ well, >l if I were reaily a king" I
would devise a punishment to lit the
crime of being a "made" contralto.
My pet aversions in ringing are the
tenor who willfully indulges in falsetto,
and the fabricated contralto. The tenor
is the worse in some respects, because he
sins against art w;th malice afore
thought, in the hope <.f r.ot being found
out. If he takes his notes pianissimo he
f-ometinies succeeds in concealing his sin
from the multitude, a::d gets applause,
which his conscience, if he has any, must
tell him he does not deserve. The manu
factured contralto is more sinned against
than sinning, as she is generally the dupe
of some ienorant or unscrupulous charla
tan who undertakes to "make voices
while you wait."
In Milan I once lived in the house with
a made contralto and had an ouportunity
of studying her from the earliest stages of
her career to her final downfall, and I
always ihink of her when I hear admir
ing friends saj* in awestruck tones of
some poor victim of the charlatan's wiles:
"She enn sing down to E and blow the
rooi off when she lets hersell loose, and
before the took lessons from Mr. So-and-so
she had not a single low tone in her
voice."
The girl I watched grow into a contralto
came from America, with a nice little
mezzo-soprano voice, and was tempted by
a maestro who ho couid alter and
change voices, just as a dressmaKer makes
over old-fashioned gowns. "You pay
your money," he said (that preliminary
â was never neglected), "and you t;ifce your
choice â licht soprano, dramatic soprano,
coniralto: lean make you sing anything
from 'Az'jcena' to 'Linda da Chamounix. 1 "
She chose contralto, because in spite of
the rate at which they are being manufac
tured there is still a tradition that con
tralios are scarce. The poor girl had an
agonizing time trying to acquire what she
caiJed her "ciiest" note?, for nature had
not given her any ; but one diy when she
was crappiing with all the vowels and
consonants of the alphabet in her efforts
she heard a peddler out in the street call
ing '"Fantoiole." He was crying his
wares in the deep, sepulchral, hollow
sounding tones that peddlers, costerraon
gers and made contraltos all affect.
"That' 3 what I want," exciaimel the girl;
and moved by a sudden inspiration she
cried "Dantofole," too, in a tone so.deer>,
Hollow and sepulchral that she almost
wept, with joy at hiving 'got" the con
traito production. Her maestro congratu
lated her on her intelligence, and said
that covtermon ers, although untutored
children of- nature, often have beautiful
chest tones.
Just six months aiterwara that girl
learned the error of her ways. By that
time she had two distinct voices, the one
above her costermon-.-er tone?, which way
thin and reedy and was crowing smalier
by degrees and beautifully less, and the
notes the had learned from tha coster
rnoncer, which were growing heavier,
coarser ana more unnatural day by da}*.
Her co M . version is another story. She said
st the time that she would li ice to under
take a lecturing tour, in order to make a
horrid fxarap'e of herself for the banefu
of other misguided mezzo-sopranos, just
as reformed drunkards get up on plat
forms and tell about the error of the days
when they served tlie demon rum. But
the pity ol it is her preachine would not
have been of any use, for t:ie poor little
mezzo-sopranos who are shrieking out un
natural low notes would never have lis
tened. They all hope some day to bridge
over the bre.-.k between their natural and
their acquired voices, and in the mean
time they say triumphantly, "Why, even
Scalchi has breaks between her registers."
Quite true; but every tone in Scalchi's
rich voice proclaims that she is a con
tralto, while the poor little manufactured
contraltos have (bin, reedy upper and mid
die tones.- They should judge themselves
by the-e notes, not by a few acquired Jow
tunes, the production of whicu is really
nothing but the trick of a ventriloquist. I
think the te=t medicine for a girl Â«vbo
wants to make herself into a contralto is
to hear Scalchi. for she is a contralto by
the grace of God.
NordicaisAs full of surprises as a grab
bug ut a church fair. She disappoints the
expectations of one audience and sends it
away saying that she has seen her best
days.and the next audience she wili sweej>
off i;s feet in a fervor of admiration. On
Tuesday night she gave varied samples of
her powers and not one was up to the $1300
a night standard, if I may use dollars as
a mean-; of computing art. The Hunga
rian aria was dramatically sung, but it
made Nordica's voice seem very thready,
particularly in the upper tone*, and when
she did emit a clarion - liki note
it was with visible effort. Her Mar
guerite was sweetly enough rendered,
but so soltly as to convey the impression
that her voice was tired and worn and she
was anxious to save it. ' On Thursday the
role of Leonora, of "II Trovatore" fame,
brought forth more dramatic singing than
Marguerite had done and the diva's voice
was less tired, but it still conveyed the
impression of having seen its freshest
days. From a vocal standpoint Nordica
sang both roles better eight years hco. As
for the $1300 a night quoted above I have
heard Marguerite and Leonora better sung
by sopranos who were not geiting 1300
francs a night, much less dollars.
Just as some of us were beginning to
think that Jean de Reszke (who they say
makes all the enca-'emen'.s at the Metro
politan) had concocted p. deep laid scheme
for doing better with his $1300 a night
than by engaging Nordica, and had
stirred up strife with that end in view,
Nordica sang at the third concert yester
day, and th^e of us who had ;.one. not to
scoff, but to listen somewhat coldly, re
mained to pray.
It is impossible in cold type to give any
idea of the singing Nordica gave us as
Brunhilde, sinking that made one tingle i
and thrill to the fioper tips wiih a feelini: |
of sensual delight. It was not the same
voice, cot the same woman who had sung
Marguerite. Brnnhilde was a trans
formed bein?, whose voice rang out, full,
resonant and commanding as a silver
clarion. There was no effort there; f:oin
the softest tone? to the loudest her
voice pealed forth wiih the ease of
an organ. And what exquisite modula
tions! how tender and sweet were the soft
passages. It would have been blasphe
mous indeed to mention the word "ihread
iness'' in connection with such notes t>.B
thote. I cannot attempt to explain thi3
dual personality in Nordica's voice, I can
only bow reverentially before her highest
work. Jean de Iteszke, if you were not so
wrapped up in your own elory you would
offer Nordica thric-SI3OO a night rattier
than lose such a superb artist from your
company. Marie Evelyn.

in a clever business-like manner, which
teems almost more like reason than mere
meclianical tra ning. Profe-sor Bristol's
method of directing his animals is the
best evidence that kindness is a good
teacher.

.Ail the dramatic authors and news
papers are rejoicing in the passaee of the
anti-play piracy bill. Bronson Howard,
president of the American Dramatists'
C.ub, received by mail a very ordinary
looking penholder, made of wood and
cork, in which was inserted a steel sub
pen. Accompanying v was the following
letter:
Executive Mansion, j
Washington, D. U, Jan. 6, 1897. i
My Dear Sir: I take pleasure in sending you,
from the President's nancl, the identical pen
and penholder used by him in approving Sen
ate bili 2306, relating to copyrights.

to the author for his toil and to thÂ« pub.ic
fiom spurious representation. Very truly
yours, Henry T. Thvrber,
Private Secretary.
In answer Mr. Howard wrote Secretary
Thurber as follows:
We shall keep the pen in a frame with your
letter, and with the signal ures oi all the mem
bers of the club at the p;efcent day and all the
leading managers.
Tne va.ue 01 this historical memento can
hardly be overestimated, In vinw of the turn
ing point it will always mark in the movement
of the American drama, from the mere pro
duction oi plays for the passing amusement of
the public toward the establishment of a Na

FEEDING BIRDS IN WINTER.
An Incident in the Life of Horatio Sey
mour of New York.
A most interesting method of tempting
the winter birds to come freely and linger
aboui our houses was put in practice by
the late Horatio Seymour, a man who was
in the most intimate harmony with ali
bird and wild life. A few weeks after his
long Presidential contest with General
Grant, which ended in the election of the
latter, the writer walked one cold winter
morning from Utica to Mr. Seymour's
rural home, a low cottaee ironting a mag
nificent view of the Mohawk Valley, and
nestling in the embrace of a primeval lor
estâa woodland full of animal life, a rest
ing-place often sought hy the owner, who
was weary of political life, although it had
given him many honors.

Ji hn Allen's Story.
Private John Allen of Tupelo, Miss., the
humorist and story-teller ot the House,
briu s back .1 new story with him, which
the Washington Star prints. There is a
stirewd suspicion that ne is the suver spell
binder referred to in his story, although
he does not say so. The story is that a
silver spellbinder was traveling from one
point to another on horseback to 1511 bis
engagements, when he met a man on the
road nauling a barrel of water, that being
a section of the State where good waier
from wells or springs is a rather scnrco
article. The silverite fell'iDlo conversa
tion with the man with the water-barrel,
and as they were discussing the burning
issues of the campaign, the silver niÃn,
spied a goat in a field by the roadside. Ha
asked the man with the water barrel what
that goat was worth. The reply was
"aboui $2."
'Wei.," said the silverite, "if we get freo
silver that goat will be worth $4, twice as
mucii as it is now."
"Y-a-s," drawled the man, "and if I had
this ban-el of water in hades, it would be
worth $1000 at least."
The silverite '.aid nothing, but rode on,
thinking deeply.

V Explanation.
I The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
* at station indica;e maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*.
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po^n s of equal air pressure; iio
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually .dccomDanled by fair weather: "low"
refers to /low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather ana rain*.
I "Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast.. Whin the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low"- Is inclosed with isobars o*
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
he pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

UNION STOCKYARDS. 111.. Jan. 23.â The
week's receipts of cattle have been only about
43,500; such moderate arrivals would in ordinary
times have materially enhanced prices, but at
present few are required. A mere handful was on
sale to-day and they were taken at steady prices.
I 1 lie run of hogs to-day was liberal, although con
siderably under last Saturday. There was a good
demand and prices ruled strong to 'jy 2 c higher.
The week's supply was 210,000, against 222,000
last week and 129,400 for the corresponding week
!a-t year. The receipts of sheep for the week
) were 62,200. against 71,778 last week and 02,45-'
for the corresponding period in 1896. Ihe supply
to-day was small and easily disposed of at mm
prices.

HE WOULD NOT DENY IT.
Startling Charge, in Which a Judge
: Admits a Great Deal. .
A Federal Judee lately charged a jury
in a liquor case as follows, says Lease and
Comment: "In later years there seems
to have been a disposition to deny or ig
nore' judicial knowledge as to what con
stitutes intoxicating liquors and the
courts have manifested a desire to dis
avow any judicial knowledge on this sub
ject. At the same time some of the courts
have not hesitated to impute to juries an
extensive knowledge â ; and information in
this regard. ; This court, however, will
follow the precedent established by the
decision of Chancellor Wai worth upon
this subject, and will assume judi
cial knowledge concerning intoxicating
liquors. * *' *;In a trial in the State of
Wisconsin, where the question arose in
1883, the trial. Judge declared that a man
must be almost a driveling idiot who did
not know what.' beer was, and that it was
not necessary to prove it to be an intoxi
cating liquor.
"Later the Supreme Court of that State,
in passing on the charge of the trial, the
Judge declared ttiat his rulings in the case
upon this question were not only clearly
correct, but if his peculiar manner gave
them force and emphasis it was not only
proper but commendable. This court,
therefore, will neither otultify itself nor
impeach its own veracity by telling you
that it, has not Judicial knowledge that
the liquor commonly known as 'whisky 1
is an intoxicating liquor, or that the drink
commonly called a 'whisky cocktail,' is
an intoxicating drink."
The members "of Boston's Ancient and
Honorable Artillery Company are doing
their utmost to have the famous old
FaneuiJ Hall made fireproof. There are
many .valuable . historic relics- In the
building which could not be replaced in
case of lire. ." . - â¢

Big Cities of the Union
|""^wO LONG as human nature pre
-M 1 serves its distinctiveness, so long
>55#,v will comparisons continue to be
made. Individuals compare their condi
tions, and enjoy satisfaction in contem
plating their enhanced financial or social
standing resulting from the adoption of
some method peculiar to themselves.
Nations. exercise their pride in the display
of government affording special ad
vantages and privileges, and communities
forming a town or city are not exempt
from the rule, the point dwelt upon by
each of the communities being its pos
session of one or more desirable condi
tions to perfect living not possessed by
other organized communities.
The science of municipal government is
now very close to being an exact one.
That it is not so everywhere applied is
due to one of two reasons â either the
badly governed community is lacking in
common knowledge, or good government
is rendered Impossible by the existence of
a loose system permitting the undue as
sumption of power by the dishonest por
tion of the community. This latter con
dition is rendered easier of attainment in
a republic than under a more concen
trated form of government, for the reason
that the rights of the individual are too
often considered by the many as being
above the rights of the state. It is largely
due to this reason that the science of mu
nicipal government has not reached that
perfection in this country which it has at
tained abroad.
The element of cupidity forms a large
part of most men, and in the political
"bos;" it is markedly predominant. Its i
presence ia the lever moving the thought- !
less masses with a power against which I
patriotic unselfishness has 100 often ;
striven in vain, and its power wiil continue I
until the majority of those whose privilege |
it is to make the Government learn by I
experience that their interests are en- ;
hanced and their necessities more speed
ily and better met by the application of j
the true principle that the rights of the
state are above the rights of the indi
vidual â in other words, the conveniences
and comforts of the many may not be
disregarded in order to increase the spe- j
cial enjoyments of the few. There is no I
trampling upon individual rights in the !
exercise of suci> a principle, ia every city
the numerical majority of the voters gen- â 
erally representsthe poor and measurably
ignorant, if not the vicious and depraved.
From this, it has been tiioueht that "these
classes holding the majority ot the votes,
and consequently choosing the rulers, the
resulting bad government is not surpris- j
ing. But such argument is specious. The '
lust of power and wealth is quite as cor
rupting as poverty and ignorance, and |
moreover is of greater potency for evil,
because of ils intelligence. If two-tnirds
of the voting population of any large city |
were a proletariat mob, without political
rights or interests, it would not be long
before fierce rivals for power would bo at
work organizing them into factional ;
rights.
Bad government is always due to organ
ization on the part of its supporters and
to corresponding lack of organization
among those honestly desirous of good
government. Without organization any
kind of government is impossible.
Those methods and practices which have
secured success in administration ot pri
vate business interests and enterprises are
equally if not more powerfully potent in
the conduct of municipal affairs. The
greatest merchants known to the com
mercial world recognize and strictly act
upon one undeviating principle: One
man at the head of each branch or depart
ment of the business, and every one of
these responsible to the chief head of all.
On the other side ol the water is a city
of 500,000 inhabitants, compactly built,
covering about 9'jOO acres. It is a great
manufacturing city. It makes and sells
its own gas, collects and sells its water
supply, builds its own street railroads, and
has made a closer approach to successful
solution of the sewage problem than
has been accomplished elsewhere.
It has provided for its citi
zens spacious and benutiful parks;
splendid swimming and Turkish baths at
less than cost; magnificent free libraries

CHRISTIAN OR ROMAN?
iiuman Remains Dug Out of the Gravel
in England.
An interesting discovery has been made
near Horncastle. England, says a corre
spondent. In the outskirts of the town Mr.
G. W. Smith, seedsman and greengrocer,
was employing a laborer to dig gravel on
his premises. About two feet, below the
surface the man's "pick" struck against
something hard, which, on investigation,
proved to be a leaden coffin. It was em
bedded in the gravel and proved to be in a
fairly good state of preservation. The
sides and ends, however, had lost cohe
sion between themselves and the lid, the
latter being also broken in the process of
uncovering it. Owing to this want of co
hesion the upper soil hud fallen in and
filled the interior. This was carefully re
moved when there was disclosed to view a
perfect skeleton, since pronounced by
medical experts to be that of a female.
The cofiin was five feet two inches in
length, the body, of course, being rather
shorter. Last week, as the gravel digging
was continued, a second leaden coffin
was exhumed about a yard to the
north of the former. This was in very
muck the same condition, the lid only
being rather more broken in extricating
it. This coffin was 5 feet 7 inches in
length. The bones were larger, and are
pronounced to be those of a male. Some
twenty-four years ago three leaden cof
fins were found within 100 yards of the
same site while workmen were digging
with a view to laying the foundation of a
and museums, art galleries and art
schools; and is, above all, a business city
run by business men upon business prin
ciples with a very low rate of taxation.
Its gas is sold at a price of 50 cents per
1000 feet, and the cost of water to the con
sumer is almost nothing. This great city
is practically free from debt and is the
owner of immense values in realty and
buildings. Its citizens enjoy benefits un
known to those of other communities,
benefits possible only under a well-admin
istered municipality. No socialist has
ever been elected to its Councils. It is the
city of Birmingham, England.
That such a condition of affairs is to be
desired goes without argument. It may
not prove uninteresting to briefly examine
conditions as now exist In the principal
cities and see which one promises the
speediest realization of good municipal
government.
The table herewith presented has been
prepared from data furnished by the
United States Bureau of Statistics in thg
report of the last census and contains
some ligures which are worthy or atten
tion, it is a statement showing the popu
lation and the public debts of the fifteen
largest cities in the United States and also
the assessed valuation of property, the
percentage such assessed valuation bears
to the actual value, the rate of taxation in
each city, the actual value of city prop
erty, the rate ot taxation based upon
actual values, the amount of wealth per
capita and the amount of debt per capita
in the respective cities. No table has ever
been published until now giving the data
embraced in the last four columns of this
table. The enormous total of actual
wealth shown by New York is not. as a
matter of fact, the correct showing. A
great portion is actually owned by non
residents, but is held by New York capi
talists under their control for purely spec
ulative purposes. The per capita wealth â
obtained in all cases by dividing the actual
value of property by the population â is,
therefore, misleading. A similarcondition
in lesser degree obtains in Philadelphia
and Boston, while in Washington the
holdings of the General Government are
embraced in the total of actual property
values. Notwithstanding these lacts, tlie
amount of per capita debt holds as against
the taxpayer, and it is consoling to the
city taxpayer out here on the far Pacific
toast to learn from this reliable data that
while his Eastern brother may be bathing
in the financial sunshine of fictitious
wealth he has to rustle with exceeding
energy to meet the payment of a heavy
per capita debt, a labor which the Western
man is exempted from.
Among these giants of municipal
growth San Francisco stands proven the
most desirable of all for the man who
owns his own home, cr is engaged in
business transactions necessitating the
ownership oi property. Tne table shows
that the individual San Franciscan holds
$1303 of the wealth of his City, and is
called upon to meet but 07 cents and 7
mills of the City debt.
A homely adage, but an exceedingly !
trite one, has it that "the proof of the ;
pudding is in the eating thereof." That j
form and practice of municipal adminis- I
tration which can confer upon the iudi- j
vidual citizens of its community so splen- |
did a condition of financial affairs as is j
here exhibited stands above criticism, j
It is a condition whicu must attract the
attention of every thoughtful man con
templating the change of his business
location irom a place where a per capita !
city debt of $25 to $80 stands like a menac- !
ing specter that will not down, to some â 
other community where such harassment
is impossible.
It might be said by the uninformed that
the paltry amount of San Francisco's per
capita debt was due to an absence of pub
he works and enterprises such as in this
modern age mark the presence of high
class civilization. Only the ignorant could
entertain such erroneous imaginings. But
very few cities equal San Francisco in
matter of public institutions. Her parks,
her museums, her art schools and gal
leries, her baths and other affairs devised
and maintained for the education and en
tertainment of her citizens are pre-emi
nently first class and modern. They are
nonconformist chapel. No care was
taken of these, and they wera disposed of
as old lead. Several Roman cinerary urns
have been dug up at different times in
Ihis locality, as well as many Roman
coins and other antiquities. The main
question|is, Were these iead coffins Roman
or Christian? On the same side of the
town there is a public recreation ground
called the "Wong"â an old Saxon word
for "field." Were tney Saxons? From
their lying east and west the correspond
ent is inclined to consider them Christian.
Their somewhat rude construction, as
well as the absence of any kind of inscrip
tion, also incline him to suppose that they
were originally inner "shells," inclosed in
a wooden exterior, but no trace of de
cayed wood was perceptible. â Boston

THE SEEDS IN A PUMPKIN.
How a Dream Made Thomas Kambo a
Winning Guegser.
Several months ago, when pumpkins
were ripe, William Wint, proprietor of
the saloon at 150 Perm avenue, bought a
large yellow one with preen stripes and
placed a box alongside of it for gu-seses
as to the number ot seeds it contained.
The iruit of the cornfield was not to be
cut until December 26, and then the per
son who guessed the correct number or
nearest to it was to receive the contents
of the box. Many of the patrons of the
house put a number of guesses in the
box, each costing 5 cents, and when
the box was opened there was $6 65 in
it. Some of the guesses ran up to thou
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, IS3T.
as free to use by the general public as are
any similar institutions elsewhere, in fact
in many respects freer. The magnificent
Free Public Library, carrying 100.C00
bound volumes of the best literature of
the world, has 1500 daily readers and over
20,000 borrowers, who take to their homes
to read at leisure the volumes they de
sire. This without any ptice or fee what
ever. The schools and higher institutions
of learning of San Francisco are noted
throughout the world for their high stan
dard of excellence. Astronomy and nat
ural physics have their greatest temples at
the Golden Gate.
The San Francisco millionaire has long
been a thing of common talk. He is a dif
ferent creature from those of this class
elsewhere. He keeps in touch with his
fellow-citizen, and while hs may lack
some of the traits which mark the one
who looks toward Eastern Atlantic shores
for guidance in the etiquette of the bac
carat table and the cut of knee breeches,
he prefers the old-fashioned ways and
customs of good old-lashioned '49ers, and
does not falter when appeals to his pnrse
are made to aid in the betterment of his
poorer fellows. No greater, widespread
philanthropy has ever been witnessed
than that practiced by the California mil
lionaire.
High above all other things San Fran
cisco is emphatically a business city, run
by business men upon business principles.
She can with pardonable pride point to a
lesser number of business failures and
foreclosures than can any other city of her
size. And she is not yet out of swaddling
clothes. The business of the Gulden Gate
is in its infancy.
For a long time the fair harbor of San
Francisco has been antagonized by the
selfish policy of a powerful corporation
which by sharp practices obtained control
of rights of way for land transportation
leading from the Golden Gate to the East
erc States, and which in the pursuit of its
grasping policy has done all that cupidity
and greed could do to thwait enterprise
and deter industry by the imposition of
inhibitory rates. Recently the National
Congress has interposed its rightful pro
tection to the Pacific Coast, and the re
straint which has heretofore impeded
manufacturing and commercial industries
will shortly cease to be. Then will dawn
the bright morning of the golden land.
With the commerce ot half the world dis
embarking at her wharves, with other and
adequate railroads leading to the interior
of the continent and to the shore 3of the
Atlantic, with rates of fairness making it
both possible and profitable to ship to the
distant points the countless products of
the favored Pacific Slope, San Francisco
will swiftly assume her regal rights as the
greatest commercial center.
Fifty years from now the maritime
trade of San Francisco will outrank that
of any other city of the world. The boy
of 10 year^, qf to-day, who may live to
witness the great City of 1947, will view a
splendid metropolis of immense area; a
city of maentticent proportions, where
grand architectural palaces of trade will
line broad and busy thoroughfares. He
will be able to stand upon some eminence
overlooking a noble bay and count Â» thou
sand huge leviathans of the deep coming
and going through the sunset gate, ea:h
laden with. the riches of the eastern and
western worlds, and all loading and un
loading their respective cargoes at the
great City's docks. A dozen lines of steel
highways will center at the City's gates,
whence their smooth-worn rails will
spread north, east and soutn, four-tracked
and occupied.
It may, to the one who deals only in the
dull prosaic, seem too much of a romance
to entertain such views as these; but to
him who studies the causes leading to the
rise and growth of cities, to him who will
in fair candor of spirit examine into the
conditions which encompass San Fran
cisco, and from such examination frame
unbiased deductions, there will be no
hesitation in arriving at the conclusion
that all which has been said in this arti
cle is not only possible, it is highly prob
able. The histories of the greatest com
mercial cities of the globe had less favor
able promises than has San Francisco.
P. M. Close,
-sands, one as high as 6000 and some as
low as 234. When the pumpkin was cut
on Saturday evening in the presence of a
large crowd and the seeds taken out there
were just 264 in it. Thomas Rambo, the
veteran blacksmith, residing at 18 South
Second street, was the nearest guesser,
his number being 263, and he took the
contents of the box.
Mr. Rambo had other guesses in the

How Anin.nU Make Their Toilet*.
Cats, large and small, make the most
careful toilets of any class of animals,
excepting some of the opossums. The
lions and tigers wash themselves in ex
actly the same manner as the cat, wetting
the d&rk, indiarubber-like ball of the fore
foot and ihe toe and passing it over the
face and behind the ears. The foot
is thus at the same time a face-sponge
and brush, and the rough tongue combs
the rest of the body. Hares also use their
feet to wash their faces, and the hare's
foot is so suitable for a brush that it is
generally used to apply the "j^aint" to
the face for the staee.â Sparo Moments.

THE BARBERS ALL
FAVOR THE BILL
The Measure to Have Bar
bers Appointed Is
Popular.
Officers of the Organizations of
the Craft Speak With
Emphasis.
They Declare Strongly and Unani
mously Against Five-Cent Shops
and Low-Pric.d Work.
There is much interest concerning the
bill which has been introduced into the
Senate by General John H. Dickinson to
provide that it shall be unlawful for any
person who is not now a practicing barber
in this State to commence such practice
without a certificate from a board of ex
aminers to be appointed by the Governor,
Unlike the majority of acts which make
their appearance in Sacramento, this one
seems to have ao visibie opposition on
the part of those principally concerned.
Conrad Troall, at 659 Clay street, who
is secretary of the Barbers' Protective
Union, speaking for the craft yesterday,
said: "This bill meets with the indorse
ment of the Darbers not only of this City,
but of the State, and, I misht add, of the
Pacific Coast.
D.Sc.
"The question has been discussed at our
meetings, and it was eventually decided
to consult with General Dickinson, as a
lawyer and a legislator, to see what could
be done to prevent scab 5-cent shops, and
at the same time keep the profession up
to a standard of respectability and living
wages. Out of this consultation the pres
ent Lull has resulted."
S. Fuchs, at 325 Grant avenue, who is
the employment secretary of the Barbers'
Association of the Pacific Coast and vice
president of tiie Barbers' Protective
Union, spoke in a similar strain. He was
very pronounced in his opposition to the
existence of and the class of work done at
the "Barbers' College" at 1515 Howard
street, where m n and women are turned
out as full-fledged barbers at short notice.
"This place," he said, "is dragging
down our craft. In it men, boys and girls
are tnken in indiscriminately if they will
put up a certain sum of money and are
turned out full-fledged barbers after a few
weeks' work to make room for others who
enter on the same terms. The result of
this is that those so turned out of this
college consider themselves barbers until
they get into a tirst-class shop.
"They cannot hold positions in first
class shops. They are discharged, and
the n xt thins they do is to open a 5-cent
shop for themselves or go to work for one
of this class already established.
"All of this has not only injured our
business, but it has brought it down to
the very dust, and a decent living is not
lelt for good workmen. Consequently the
bill now introduced has been sanctioned
by the association of the coast, and I hope
it will pass and become a law."
A. J. Stein of 604 Montgomery street
and other barbers also favor the bill upon
the same lines as those expressed by the
two former speakers.
At the "Barbers' College," at 1515 How
ard street, W. 8. Bncilong and W. H. Dun
nagan, the proprietors, were seen. They
were in favor of the bill, with but one
single exception, and that was that the
term of two years' service as an apprentice
is too long.
Barbers say that in the so-called Barber
College five out of fourteen apprentices
are women, and they shave and cut the
hair of all who apply, without charge, to
get practice, and by doing the work for
nothing the apprentices find subjects to
operate on.
THE MECHANICS' LIBRARY.
Members Must Soon Chooge Seven Di
rectorg From Fifteen Nominees.
A new board of seven directors for the
Mechanics' Institute Library is to be
elected on February 23, the last Tuesday
of tie month. The voting will be done
by those of the 4300 members that may
care to present themselves at the library
on that day.
There are fifteen nominees irom which
the seven will be chosen by what is known
as a preference system. Each member in
dicates on his ballot his lirst, second and
succeeding choices for one place. The
ballots are then classified and counted,
and first-choice men not having a certain
per cent of the total number of votes cast
are eliminated until the seven highest are
determined in conjunction with the sec
ond-choice votes.
Four of the nomineesâ Denicke, Cole,
Formhais and Kendrick â are members of
the present board. Some of the members
of the library particularly conversant
with the successful conduct of affairs in
the past are very desirous that Mr. Den
icke be re-elected, and are worrying lest
in the scattering of votes among the
many candidates the library should lose
the services of one of its most energetic
workers.
Following are the nominees and the
business interests they represent:
R. P. Clement, lawyer. Mills buiiding;
Ernest A. Denicke, Oakland Preserving Com

BOTH CLASSES VIOTOBIOUS.
Polytechnic Juniors Won at Baseball
and Middles at Football.
Two rival classes of the Polytechnic
High School played baseball and football
at Central Park yesterday afternoon be
fore an enthusiastic crowd of youthful
spectators.
The baseball game resulted in a victory
for the Junior Class. The score was 12 to
7. In the first inning the Junior Class
made five runs, while the Middle Class
was shut out. Among the noticeable fea- !
tares of the match were the playing of j
Duden of the Middle team and the pitch
ing of Dorothy of the Junior nine.
In the football match the Middle Class
men retrieved themselves and defeated
their rivals by a score of 14 to 0. Three
touchdowns were made but no goals were i
kicked and Keene of the Junior team was
compelled to score a salety, giving the
Junior eleven two points. Two of the
touchdowns were made by Duden, who.
Dy the way. is one of the members of the
famous liule Y. M. C. A. team, and one
was made oy Nathan. In individual play
ing Duden and Hammer, haltbacks for
the Middle Class, and Holcombe, guard
for the Junior Class, did creditable work. :
The officials were: Bishop, referee;
Brickett, umpire; Pope and Police Ser
geant Michael Joseph Conboy, linesmen.

NO DISCIPLINE
FOR JUDGES
The Bar Association Will
Kindly Give Them
Free Rein.
It Was Thus Decided at a Final
Meeting Held Yester
day.
Other Revisions Aso Male in the
Proposed Amendment for
Judicial Reform
The San Francisco Bar Association held
its nnal meeting for the revision of its
proposed constitutional amendment for
judicial relorm yesterday afternoon.
There was a full attendance, and the
conlerence was spirited throughout.
Section 13 was taken up first. It de
fines the jurisdiction and powers of the
Superior Courts and does not differ ma
terially from the present law. One im
portant item provides that injunctions
and writs of prohibition may be issued
and served on lep;al holidays and non
judicial days. The section was adopted
after the elimination of a few redundant
expressions.
From section 14 the following clause was
cast out in its entirety :
The Judees of the Superior Court, residing
! or noiding sessions of the court within any
I county in which more than two sessions of the
court shall be held at the same time, shall by
secret ballot choose from their own number a
presiding Judge, who shall continue to pre-
I side during his term of office as Judge of the
! court.
For the clause stricken out the follow
ing substitute, sent in by Judge Seawell,
was inserted :
In every county where there are more than
two Judges of the Superior Crurt for such
county, they shall choose from, their own
number a presiding Judge, wlio may be re
moved at their p.easure.
The next section was adopted as recom
mended by the committee. It reads as
follows:
The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and
of the District Courts of Appeal, the Judges of
the Superior Courts and trie Justices and
Judges of all the other courts of record, ex
cepting those hereinafter designated as
trustees of the bar, may be removed by con
current resolution of both houses oi the Legis
lature, adopted by a iwo-thlrds vote of each
house; but no removal shnll be made by vir
tue ot this section unless the cause tnereof
and the votes by ayes and uoes be entered on
the journal, nor unless the pnrty complained
of has been served -with a copy ot the com-
Elaiut against him and had an opportunity of
eing heard in his defense. Trustees of the
bar and all other judicial offices within this
State may be removed in the mauner herein
after provided.
Sections 16 to 37 inclusive were consid
ered as a whole, they relating generally
to the same subjectâ the creation of a
court of discipline. In tbeir considera
tion a breezy debate ensued.
It was this proposed court of discipline
that came under the condemnation of
Judge Van R. Paterson in the columns
of The Call a few days ago.
Attorney William J. Herrin began the
debate by moving tnat the portion relat
ing to the establishment of a court of
discipline for the judiciary, as well as the
bar be stricken out. 4
Attorney John A Wright didn't like f
this proposition a little bit, and made a
lengthy speech in favor of a disciplinary
court lor the ermine. He was followed by
Dr. Edward R. Taylor, Attorneys Wil
liam H. Fifieid, George A. Kankin and
others, who as strongly oppose! so exten
sive a scope of power for the proposed
court.
The aftermath of the debate was mani-
fest in the result of a vote against giving
the proposed tribunal power to discipline
the judiciary.
Next Monday a committee of four will
meet and draft the proposed amendment
as revised, when it will be taken to Sacra
mento and laid berore the JuJiciary Com
mittee of the Legislature. Judge R. Y.
Hayne will ant as chairman of the com*
mittee, and it is probable that the threa
attorneys composing the body that
drafted the original document will be his
associates. They are John A. Wright,
A. L. Rhodes and Columbus Bartlett.
A gold pen with careful usage will last
from fifteen to twenty years.
