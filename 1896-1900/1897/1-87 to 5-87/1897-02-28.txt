POLICY OF COERCION.
Jtvtiia Trying to Fore* thÂ« Greek* Out
of Crete.
. BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 27.â The news
â¢"agency 'dispatch from St. Petersburg pub
: lished in the London and Continental
. newspapers yesterday purporting to de
scribe Russia's attitude on the Cretan
question and asserting that the Russian
Government had demanded Greece to re
â¢ â â¢call her troops wit;. in three days, is on
.â¢â "pood authority, though its publication
has' been belated. A similar proposal is
' .sued by the St. Petersburg Government
. reached the Foreign Office of Germany
and other powers early in the week and it
is now said upon unquestioned authority
*â  that it met with remonstrances from .Eng
land, France and Italy, but was assented
. 'to by Germany and Austria.
This proposal of Russian diplomacy and
the real importance of the communica
tion lies in the fact that Russia is de
termined upon a policy of speedy and de
â¢ cisive coercion of Greece by force of arms
and that the northern empire is ready to
' apply such measures with or without the
co-operation of the other powers. The act-
J"aJ state of the case is that Russia agreed
â to delay action for three days only upon
/the strength of representations from the
British and French Governments that
time ought to be accorded to the Greek
Government in which to consider its posi
tion. The impetuous initiative taken by
â  Russia has certainly accelerated the pov
ers which are now turning mainly toward
i procedure of coercion. \
Official advices which have been received
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
from Athens have caused the conviction
that the fleets of the powers must make
their anpearance in the Fiseus before the
King of the Hellenes will yield to the
will of the concerted Governments and
that his submission will certainly be ac
companied by the resiguation of the
Greek Cabinet and probably by the abdi
cation of the Greek monarch.
A semi-official article in the Pesther
Lloyd conveys the idea that the Austro-
Hungarian Government, though now lol
lowin;? the lead of Russia ana Germany, is
very much averso to Russia's style of initi
ative as affirming her right to be regarded
as the paramount power in the Balkans.
In official circles in Germany, however,
Russia's haste in the matter is attributed
to the movements which have been made
by Servia and Bulgaria toward an offen
sive alliance against Turkey.
King Alexander of Servia will start
from Belgrade to Sofia to-morrow to con
fer with Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria
upon the situation and according to a dis
patch published in the Frankfort Gazette
the Governments of Bulgaria and Servia
have demanded from the Porte an explan
ation of the massing of the Turkish troopa
on the frontier of those States.
The recall of M. Rangabe, the Greek
Minister to Germany, is imminent. Not
only is his own Government dissatisfied
with the way in which he had conducted
the negotiations entrusted to him, but he
has offended the Kaiser by his imprudent
expressions in newspaper interviews in
which he has strongly criticized the per
sonal interference of the Emperor between
the German Ministers and the diplomatic
representatives of foreign powers re
called, nnd it will be surprising indeed if
he is not.
CAUSED BY BONDHOLDERS.
Turkish Security Holder* Seem to Jiule
the finglifh Attitude.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 27.â The proposals
for the settlement of the Cretan troubles
are widely commented upon by the news
papers throughout the country. The con
servative oigans as a rule find in them a
general solution of the difficulty, but
there is a divergence of opinion on the
part of the literal organs.
The Manchester Guardian, speaking in
behalf of the Liberals, says it has no ob
jection to the scheme for granting au
tonomy to the island, but it strongly
objects to the Greet troops being com
pelled to withdraw before the Turk-.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, leader of
the Liberal party, and the Karl of Kim
berley, the leader of the Liberals in the
House of Lords, have decided to follow
this line when the debate on the Cretan
question takes place at the beginning of
next week.
The more advanced Liberals back Greece
in the attitude she has assumed. Tue
Right Hon. Arthur Dilke Acland, who
was a member of the last Liberal Cabiuet,
delivered a speech at Northampton last
night, in which he referred to the Cretan
trouble. Great Britain, be said, could not
redeem the past, but one step had been
taken which would redeem to some extent
the fair fame of Europe. The hour and
glory of this step belonged to Greece.
Complaint is made that Great Britain's
action is due to the sordid interests of
British holders of Turkish and Greek
bonds, and it is said the country is para
lyzed by the pawnbroking proclivities of
the bondholders.
A dispatch received from Athens last
night said the powers had not yet suc
ceeded in arriving at an agreement as to
the nature of the coercive methods to be
applied against Greece in the event of her
refusing to listen to the mandate of the
concert, nor as to the date for the applica
tion of the measures when they shall be
agreed upon.
HUNGARIANS ARE FOR GREECE.
Premier Bnnffu Outline* thÂ« Situation
to State* men.
BUDA PESTH, BvnaAMX, Feb. 27.â
The Government was questioned to-day
in the Kepvistohaz, or House of Repre
sentatives, by Herr Kossuth, son of the
Hungarian patriot, regarding the attitule
of Austria-Hungary on the Cretan ques
tion. Herr Kossuth also desired to be in
formed as to wnetber in the event of
Greece refusing to accede to the demands
of the powers Austria-Hungary would
adopt forcible means to compel her.
In reply to the interpellation. Baron
Banffy, the Prime Minister, stated that
there was absolutely no foundation for
any fear that the empire would become
involved in war on account of Crete. He
declared that the only object of the
powers in intervening was to preserve the
peace of Europe, which was threatened by
Greece. The efforts of the powers were
solely directed to the restoration of order
in Crete. In conclusion, Baron Banffy
made the important statement that the
powers were unanimous in their deter
mination to permit Greece to annex Crete,
and force would be used, if necessary, to
compel Greece to comply with the de
mand made upon her.
TO CORNER THE WOOL MARKET.
Boston Speculators Expect to Profit by
the Anticipated Restoration of
the Tanff.
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 27. -The Globe
says: One of the largest corners in wool
ever attempted in the United Htates at
present exists in the condition of the
Boston market in anticipation of the
restoration of a tariff or. wooi in the near
future by the McKiniey administration.
Thin morning it was learned on author
ity that a syndicate was recently formed
in this city to buy all the wool offered in
European markets in anticipation of a
duty of 10 per cent being put on wool by
the McKiniey administration.
The agents of the syndicate are buying
Australian and South American wool, and
from this time on every steamer coming
to Boston, not to apeak of special boats
to arrive, will be loaded with their cargo.
It is calculated that 1,000,000 bales of
Australian and South American wool will
be brought to this country by the syndi
cate within the given time.
The syndicate will clear $50,000, which
will come out of the pockets of the con
sumers later.

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 28, 1897â THIRTY PAGES.
The above Bketch is a reproduction of the picture in black and white presented to the Press Club of San Francisco by the well-known marine artist, W. A. Coulter.
It illustrates a scenejhe witnessed years ago, when on his way from Buenos Ayres to Southampton, England. Off the coast of Portugal a vessel in distress was sighted. Her
mtzzenmast was gone, the main had broken away above the main yard, and only the stump of the foremast remained. Every sail had been blown away, but when they
sent a boat, out to the vessel, the captain refused to abandon her. 'We were keeping our last watch," said he, "and had you not hove in sight, we would have abandoned
the old craft But if you will loan us a sail or two and some provisions we can reach port." While the necessary articles were being procured, the main yard was fished and
the running gear got ready; and, after the sail was set, the last seen of tue vessel by those on the steamer, she was scudding away for Lisbon with half a gale of wind behind
her. Mr. Coulter never forgot the scene, although it happened years ago, and be has finally reproduced it on canvas.

The thousand barrels of sugar > were

BART LEY'S EMBEZZLEMENT.
An Ex-State Treasurer of Nebraska Taken
Into Custody on Charges ot Steal
ing Nearly a Million.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Feb. 27.â Ex-State
Treasurer J. H. Bartley is to-night nomi
nally in the custody of the Sheriff, with a
possibiity of goin? to jail iv the event of
his inability to secure bail.
This action on the shortages of the ex-
Treasurer aggregating over half a million
dollars was taken to-day by Attorney-
General Miller, who swore out a warrant
charging him with the embezzlement of
State funds. The fourth count charges
Bartley with the embezzlement of $202. C00
of the general fund warrant drawn and
cashed by Bartley and not turned into
the sinking fund. The seventh count
charges him with the embezzlement of
$537,7f;2. The remaining counts are
similar.
With his attorneys Bartley appeared in
the County Judee's office at 4 o'clock this
afternoon, where the information was
read, a plea of not gnilty entered and a
continuance granted until next Thursday.
Bail was fixed at $50,000. This he was un
able to furnish and a Deputy Sheriff ac
companied him while he endeavored to
raise the amount. He was unsuccessful
up to a late hour to-night.

HOW AMERICANS
FARE IN CUBA
Destruction of a Plantation
and Arrest of the
Owner.
All This Because He Dared
Denounce the Outrages of
the Spaniards
Butcher-G?neral Weyler Stamps on a
Passport in toe Presence of
Consul Lee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.â The
Post says that Henry W. McDonnell, a
planter of Point Clear, Ala., wno owns a
large plantation in Cuba fifteen mi'es from
Havana, has arrived in Washington direct
from Cuba, where be says he was sub
jected to a series of degradations so insult
ing to his republican manhood and Ameri
canship that be has come post haste to
lay his case before the authorities of the
State Department and demand immediate
justice.
Mr. McDonnell several months apo re
ceived information at his home at Point
Clear tbat his plantation in Cuba was
being ravaged by the Spanish soldiers,
and that unless it was cultivated by spring
it wouid be confiscated by the crown. He
had left the management of his planta
tion entirely to his ngents in Cuba, who
since the revolution have been unable to
cultivate it.
He accordingly sailed for Cuba on Feb
ruary 2, and arrived at Havana February
4. On the steamer be made the acquaint
auce of a newspaper man named Hopkins,
who was representing the New Orleans
Times- Democrat. He did not know at the
time that Hopkins was a newspaperman or
the stories he had beard of the treatment
accorded reporters in Cuba would have
s rved as a barrier to further intercourse.
However, he became very intimate wiih
Hopkins, and upon landing the two spent
the firÃt day together in Havana.
Mr. McDonnell has his passport from
the State Department, duly signed by
Richard O.'ney, and numbered 15,528, so
that he deemed himself perfectly safe.
On the first day of his arrival, accom
panied by Hopkins, be rode fifteen miles
into tba country to his plantation. Every
thing was in ruins.
Not a building remained standing, all
of the expensive machinery had been
mutilated or carted away, and not a soul
was to bo seen anywhere. Four years ago,
Mr. McDonnell says, he refused $30,000 for
the plantation. Now he says he coujd
not get |500 for the property, and he does
not expect to get a cent out of it for the
next ten years.
On bis return to Havana after witness
ing the destruction caused by Spanish sol
diers, be indulged in some uncomplimen
tary remarks about the Spanish Govern
ment. These remarks were uttered pub
licly with characteristic American frank
ness and came to the eara of General
Weyler.
Within three hours, McDonnell says, he
was arrested and brought before the gen
eral charged with nothing in particular.
Hopkins was arrested at the same time,
but was not brought before Weylcr until
later, when he was released on promising
to leave the island.
McDonnell demanded at once that
Consul-General Lee be sent for and Wey
ler finally consented. General Lee ap
peared after McDonnell had .been held a
prisoner several hours and demanded
McDonnell's release.
In reply to McDonnell's claim that he
VM an American citizen in Cuba tc look
after bis property, Weyler retorted that it
wouid be to his interests to attend stiictly
tohis private affairs without regard to
Spain, and that he had better be careful
what sentiments he uttered.
McDonnell says he then exhibited hi?
passport and demanded instant release.
As he describes it, Weyler took the paper
gintreriy, looked it over an instant, and,
in the presence of Consul-General Lee,
flung it under foot with contempt and
exclaimed that it was of no importance
and had no bearing in the case.
General Lee protested and demanded an
apology, which Weyler refused.
Mr McDonnell recovered his passport
and agaiu demanded his release, saying
that It was an insult to the United States
to have her seal flung under foot in that
manner.
Weyler made several insulting remarks
to the effect that all Americans had better
remain at home, and finally consented to
set Mr. McDonnell at liberty, but added
tbat he would be constantly watched
while in Havana and that he had better
leave ?oon.
On February 16, Mr. McDonnell left
Cuba. During the few days he remained
there he was constautly under guard of a
Spanish soldier who followed him every
where. In e,very way he was made to
understand that he had better return
home.
On the streets he was insulted openly
by the Spanish and he was unable to
transact any business whatever relative io
bib plantation, whish is now unprotected
and liable to confiscation at any time.
Mr. McDonnell described the condition
of affairs in Havana and surrounding
country as appalling. Destitution was
everywhere. With Havana under martial
Jaw the Spanish soldiers were plundering,
and ravaging as they pleased. No one's
life or property was safe. Weyler was
looked upon by every one .as a tyrant.
DIED A NATURAL DEATH.
That 1Â» the Spanish Version of the Suit
Murder.
MADRID, Spain. Feb. 27.â Prime Min
ister Canovas said at a Cabinet council to
day that the question between the Amer
ican and Spanish Governments re
garding the treatment of prisoners in
Cuba by the Spanish authorities, was not
one of importance. He added that an in
vestigation had shown that Dr. Ruiz, the
American citizen who it wa^s asserted had
been murdered in prison at Guanabacoa,
had died a natural death.
OLNEY IS WAKING UP.
At LaÂ»t He Will Demand the Ueltate of
Amerlcnns.
NEW YORK, N V., Feb. 28.â A special
to the Herald from Havana, Cuoa.via Key
West, says:
, While the State Department has not
backed up Consul-General Lee unreserv-
edly, the administration has at last taken
a firm stand on one question, and that is
the length of time an American citizen
can he held incommunicado in a Spanisb
prison.
Upon this question Secretary Olney
fairly placed himself ou record shoulder
to shoulder with General Lee. He has
authorized General Lee to demand the re
lease of each and every American who
may be arrested and kept incommunicado
lor more than seventy-two hours. He has
informed the Madrid Government of the
clear and well-defined attitude our Gov
ernment has assumed on this question.
Only a few weeks ago General Weyler
informed General Lee, both verbally and
in writing, that the Spanish Government
had and proposed to exercise the right of
keeping Americana in prison and incom
municado seventy days if it should be so
decided.
The treaty rights contained in the
treaty of 1795, explained and interpreted
by the protocol of 1878, had ceased to
exist, contended General Weyler, the
moment that his proclamation of martial
law was published.
General Lee reported tue **â¢â¢â¦* to our
Government and th â¢Â» foregoing instruc
tions have been foriucoming. It remains
to be seen what policy the Madrid Gov
ernment will assume.
The Spaniard* Are Whipped.

will report at once. There are 5000 cases
of smallpox in Havana. There were 150
deaths last week. He met all the news
paper correspondents in Cuba. Ackers of
the London Times, one of the most accu
rate and be*t posted, thinks the Spaniards
are whipped. The correspondent of El
Liberal tias telegraphed his paper at Ma
drid that Gomez can indefinitely prolong
the war.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.â The
Daughters of the American Revolution
began their last dny's work with but a
slight attendance. The election of State
regents was announced.
A resolution to employ an expert book
keeper to assist the treasurer brought on
a spirited discussion as to the necessity
for such an office. Mrs. Stevenson favored
it. Mrs. Draper, the retiring treasurer,
opposed the proposition and said there
had not been a paid officer in the two
years of her incumbency. Mra. Brackett,
vice-president, said that whenever extra
help was needed it had always been fui
ni?hed. The resolution was then adopted.
Revision of the constitution and reports
of the regents took up the rest of the day.
The congress adjourned sine die to
night, with a good deal of unfinished busi
ness, which will be taken care of by the
board of management.

He had wasted away to a mere skeleton,
from want of sleep. A Mr. J.G. Ahem, of the

screams of the child, and asked if he might

that it could be speedily cured by the use of *

Oscar Lewis, yesterday issued a call to
have the directors meet in the Exchange
building at 1 o'clock to-morrow for the
puroose of drafting a memorial to be for
warded to Washington praying that the
work may be commenced forthwith.
"That petition will recite the need
of the building and the necessity of hav
ing the work continue without interrup
tion after the start is made, and also the
immediate benefit to trade, labor, com
merce and the public at large.
On Marc:i 4 a joint mass-meeting of the
members of the Board of Trade of San
Francisco, the California State Board of
Trade, the Manufacturers and Producers'
Association, the Chamber of Commerce
and the Merchants' Association will be
held in the -Chamber of Commerce Hall.
Tue purpose of this representative gath
ering has already been made known. At
this meeting the best speakers in the City
â men who are thorougly informed on the
need- of San Francisco and the Postofnca
subject â will deliver interesting ana in
structive addresses.
The Dublic bases its hopes for the com
mencement of the new building upon the
fact that within a tew days there will be a
change of administration, and that the
new regime will not prove as blind to the
interests of the City by the Golden Gate
as the outgoing administration has been.
THE BUILDERS WANT IT.
A Special Meeting of the Exchange
Called for To-Morrow Afternoon.
There will be a special meeting of the
board of directors of the Builders' Ex
change of San Francisco to-morrow at 1
o'clock, for the purpose of taking action
relative to the early starling of i he work
on the new Postoftice building. The mem
bers of this organization of artisans have
long desired to see the work begun, and in
the past raised their voice to that end.
Oscar Lewis, the president, yesterday
sent out a call for a special meeting of the
boaid oi directors, which will be held in
the exchange building, at 40 New Mont
gomery street In discutsing the matter
Mr. Lewis stated that there could be no
better time for commencing the projected
work than now.
For some time past the building and
contracting business in this City has been
dull, and this has caused considerable
. hardship to hundreds of carpenters, brick
masons and others in the building trade.
These people to whom he refers are resi
dents of this City and nearly ail have fam
ilies dependent upon them.
The men who furnish materials of all
kinds have also lost by this condition of
affairs. Of course every spring sees the
building business improve more or less,
but the present outlook does not give rise
to hopes thai there will be a building
boom next spring and summer. Hence
the erection of the large Federal building
wouid do much to relieve the labor mar
ket for contractors and workingmen ahte.
Continuing, Mr. Lewis said :
"In issuing this call for a meeting of ibe
directors of the Builders' Exchange I
fully believe that it is a subject of vital
interest to us all. I irii! suggest that good
Etrong resolutions be passed by this body
urging the authorities in Washington and
our Representatives in Congress to do all
in their power to get the work started.
Also that Congress appropriate at tbe
â¢extra session a sufficient sura of money to
keep the work going, so that there will be
no stopping when it has been started, as
â  might be the case when the $240,000 al
ready in nand for that purpo c has bf en
' used up in the first or preliminary work. 1 '
The call for the meeting reads as fol
lows:
San Francisco, February 27, 1897.
A special meeting of the board of directors of the Builders'
Exchange is hereby called for Monday, March 1, 1897, at 1 P. M.,
at 40 New Montgomery street, for the purpose of considering the
proposition to urge the authorities at Washington to begin the early
construction of the San Francisco Postoffice.
You are earnestly requested to be present. Respectfully,
Oscar Lewis, President.
Resuming, Mr. Lewis said: "The reso
lutions and memorial that lam snre will
be passed by the directors of the Builders'
Exchange will, no doubt, be based upon
business reason*. Much has been said o:
the labor market being clogged and the
unemployed needing work. This is a
matter of serious consideration, but in
addressing the people at Washington
they should not be led to believe that San
Francisco is in such a condition with its
unemployed that Congress would be per
forming a charity.

My Dear Sir :
Local members of the State Board of Trade have joined with the
Chamber of Commerce, the City Board of Trade, the Manufacturers 1 and
Producers' Association and the Merchants' Association of San Fran-
. Cisco in a call for a meeting of all the members of all these bodies,
to meet in San Francisco at the rooms of. the Chamber of Commerce
Merchants' Exchange building, California street, at 2P. M. , on. the
4th day of March, for the purpose of petitioning our Representatives
in Congress to induce the authorities at Washington to begin work at
once on the new Postoffice building in San Francisco.
We understand there is about $250,000 available for this purpose,
and it is believed by many who have considered the matter that the
expenditure of this money here at this time would not only relieve the
unemployed of this City, but that the distribution of a quarter of a
million dollars in San Francisco would result in more or less stimu-
lating business throughout the State, hence we are all^interested.
The money must be expended and the building erected sooner or later,
and no more opportune time could be selected to begin the work than now!
It is hardly expected that our members should come from a great
distance, but I am requested to give this notice, and if it is con-
venient for you to be in the City at this time, your presence and
assistance in this case will be appreciated.
YOUPB VOXT trttlTi
TO FACILITATE FEDERAL BUSINESS.
John P. Irish Emphasises the Importance of the Building
Demanded.
I have already tried to make it plain that the proposed Federal building in this
City will be far more a courthouse than J|a postoffioe. Mr. William H. Mills, in his
Call interview, is led astray by the habit of calling it a postoffice. When it was pro
posed in 188G to ask Congress to buy a site here, President Cleveland was consulted
about it in advance, and said he would not sign an, act to buy a 6ite and build a post
office alone, but, that an act for a site and building to adequate y accommodate t the
Federal courts and other Federal offices here, including perhaps the sub-treasury and
army headquarters, with room for the postoffice on the ground floor, would meet his
approval. His reasons were the same as those given by Mr. Mills, that great im
provements in collecting and distributing mail were in progress, tha: would entirely
substitute the o!d method of a great central postoffice, and that all that would be
required would be proper offices for the Postmaster and the clerical force which is
necessary to keep the books and accounts. This central office would handle mail only
as one of the city stations.
This understanding with the President was carried out The appropriation for a
site was increased from $350,000 to $1,250,000, because the Government wanted ample
space, and the final site was made large enough to bold nearly a three-acre building.
In its instructions to the local commission the Treasury forbade consideration of any
site below a large minimum area which was faxed by the department. Let me repeat,
then, that this building may shelter the courts, sab-treasury, army headquarters
navy pay office, naval hospital office, postofico, pension office, pension surgeon's
office, surveycr-ueneral and land office, postal inspectors and railway postal service,
tbe life-saving and lighthouse offices, the secret service offloe, the coast, and geodetic
and h ydrographic surveys, and the effice of the engineers of the army. All of these
outward and visible signs that we have a Federal Government present in San Fran
cisco will be under one roof, greatly to the facility of Federal business
The custom-bou'-e and internal revenue office, the shipping commissioner, im
migration commissioner, revenue agent of the treasury will occupy all of the present
postoihee and appraisers' buildings. John P. Irish.
certainly be a great relief, but our com
munication snouid brine; out with more
prominence such facts as these: That the
pre-ent postom'co is too small for the vol
ume of business transacted therein, and
in such matters cramping always entails
136*. San Francisco wants a modern post
office, in keeping with its standing among
the large cities of the United States. Our
present antiquated excuse for a postoffice
is a disgrace to tne City.
"Furthermore there is sufficient money
on hand to make a start on the work; also
that according to all we can learn tbe
plans are prepared, or are at least nearly
completed, and finally that there has
been more than sufficient delay. I be
lieve that it was something like ten years
ago that tbe subject Was first agitated.
"The agitation of this matter by our
body has been delayed a little, as it was
thought advisable to take it up at tbe
quarterly meeting of the Builders' Ex
change, which will be held on March 5,
but upon a second thought I declted that
the present is the best time to act. The
Postoffice will also be discussed at the
quarterly meetiner, and I feel assured that
our members will do all in their power to
accomplish the desired results."
COME ONE, COME ALL.
Active Preparations Being Made for
the Mass-Meeting on Thursday.
The officers of the five large commercial
and industrial bodies of this City, who on
Friday decided to call a mas^-meeting of
their organizations for the purpose of
mating an effort to have the work on the
new Post< fflce be^un as soon as possible,
have started out in earnest to make the
gathering a success. By to-morrow morn
ing nearly every member of the Chamber
of Commerce will be in receipt of a notice
of the meeting, accompanied by an urgent
request to be present.
Yesterday President Hugh Craig of that
body said: "The meeting will bo a suc
cess. I believe that the ciange of admin
istration, the extra session of Congres3
and other considerations will start the
ball to rolling if we of this City properly
impress those at Washington that the
commercial bodies and the representative
citizens of San Francisco are thoroughly
in earnest in tbe request for tbe work to
start. Tnii is whai we propose to do at
the mass-meeting."
The members of the Merchants' Associa
tion are equally interested in this proposi
tion, and at the gathering of the directors
of that body yesterday Secretary J. R.
Freud was instructed to lelegraph at once
to Congressmen Loud and Maguire for in
formation upon the Postoffice question.
Answer* are rx|>ecte<l to-morrow.
Secretary Freud said: "The Merchants'
Association will be well represanted at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1897.
the meeting in the Chamber of Commerce
Hall. The members are all in hopes that
the Postoffice will be a reality In the near
future."
At the State Board of Trade rooms at 16
Post street the office force was kept
bu?y sending out letters to its members.
J. A. Filcher lost no time, and by 3 o'clock
a big bundle of letters was deposited in
thÂ« mail.
Mr. Filcher stated that he was sure that
the State Board of Trade will turn out in
large numbers to attend the meeting, as
all of its local members are and have been
earnestly desirous of having the new
building constructed as speedily as possi
ble.

Why Is Not the New Postofflce
Built? 71'
San Francisco city Argus.
The City Argus frequently has called
attention that a site was purchased for a
postoffice some y?ars sine?, but no efforts
have been made to build a postoffice. Now
Mayor Phelan feels action should be taken,
as it would give employment to our peo
ple, which is no small matter. He de
clares San Francisco has contributed in
custom duties alone over $100,000,000
in the last fourteen years, and the delay
in erecting the postoffice is unpardon
able and inexcusable. If Congre>amaa
Maguire bad leut his best energies to
force action something no doubt
would have been effected. But no,
he has let the "new postoffice building"
pass his understanding. His wanton neg
lect is now painfully apparent. What do
we tend men to Congress lor but to look
out for our interests. Have they done it?
Has Maguire ever been heard urging a
Postoffice building being erected in tbii
City? Has Loud's voice been, raised for
one? The delay in acting can be placed
at the door of the Coueressmen who rep
resent San Francisco. The Call is deserv
ing of warm praise for its warm advocacy
for early action. It says Supervising
Architect Aifcen declares that the begin
ning of the work is yet far off. There is
a mysterious agency thatdeiavs it. There
is $210,000 in the United States Treasury to
the credit of the new building. Lack of
interest by our representatives The Call
should understand is the true cause, de
pend upon It.

PROCEEDINGS OF
SENATE AND HOUSE
Labor Antagonizes Capital,
With the Usual
Result.
Postoffice Appropriation Bill Is
the Subject ot a Long
Dabate.
â â
Senator Allison Wax s Facetious at
the Expense oi Hill and
Dnbois.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27. -In the
Senate to-day tho naral appropriation bill
was reported by Hale (K.) of Maine, and
placed on the calendar.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts introduced
a bill to pumsh obstruction of the exercise
of constitutional power in either house of
Congress by a member thereof, by impos
ing a fine of flOWfor willful absence. It
also makes the seat vacant upon a failure
to qualify. Hoar said be did not expect
action on the bill now, but he hoped it
might be passed in the near future, in
order that the dangers of the situation
which might arise at any time might be
avoided.
A long sworn statement was read by the
clerk from ifficers of the Knights of La
bor .n regard to the dismissal of som em
ploye! by the Metropolitan Street Rail
way Company of Washington and in sup
port of a concurrent resolution introduced
by Hill (D.) of New York for the with
drawal from the President of an act au
thorizing the extension of the company's
road. The contention of tba Knights of
Labor was backed by Allen (Pop.) of Ne
braska, who arraigned the committee tor
the District of Columbia for not having
reported to the Senate the bearing given
by the committee to the representatives
of the Knigbts and to the officers of tha
railroad company.
Mills (D.) of Texas spoke in favor of the
recall of the act, and said that if it came
aaain before the Senate be would move to
insert in it a provision that no employe
of the company should be discharged un
til charges were preferred against him
and sent before the District Commission
ers, who have authority to hear evidence
and to past upon the validity of the
charges.
laulkner (D.) of West Virginia, a mem
ber of the District Committee, defended
tue action of the committee in the mat
ter.
After some further discussion Gallinger
(R.) of New Hampshire moved to lay on
t c table the resolution for the reca i of
the bill. The motion was agreed to â ayes
30, noes 24.
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas offered a resolu
tion instructing the Committee on Finance
to report at the preset 1 1 session what
action it had taken in the matter of the
mv stigaiion ordered last session into the
bond sales by the Secretary of the Treas
ury. The resolution weut over without
action.
A motion to reconsider the vote of last
evening t assing a bill for refunding the
debt of the Territories was made by Builer
(Pop.) of North Carolina aud went over
without action.
Tue postottice appropriation bill was
then proceeded wiiii, and Pettigrew (Sil
ver) of South Dakota made a statement as
to the exorbitant railroad charges for mail
transportation. He said that me pending
bill ought to be amended by providing
that no more than 80 per cent of the
amount now paid for railroad mail trans
portation shail be paid hereafter. This
would strike one-fifth off the cost, saving
nearly six millions a year.
Al.ison remarked that there was in the
bill an amendment for the appoimment of
a committee to inquire into the whole sub
ject and the amendment, therefore, was
unnecessary. It was ruled out, however,
on a poi.it of order made by Faulkner that
it was general 1-gisiation.
Butler offered another amendment to
the item appropriating 13,600,000 for rail
way postoffice-car service â the amend
ment bting that not mure than 10 per cent
of the ost of cars shall be paid for their
use. T:ie amendment was laid on the
table.
Aliiaon offered a substitute for the com
mittee amendment for the appointment
of a select committee of three Senators
and three representatives to inquire into
the whole subject of mail transportation
and its costs. The suris ituie merely
changes tha committee into a commission.
The amendment was modified accord-
ingly.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire moved
as a substitute for the committee amend
ment as thus modified, a proposition that
the questions concerning the correction of
alleged abuses in the postal service, includ
ing second-class mnil matter, toe exten
sion 01 iree delivery in the rural region, the
reduction of the cost of railroad transpor
tation, the adoption of 1-cent postage for
eintrle letters and other like questions, be
examined oy a special reform commis
sion, consisting of the Senate and Hou-e
Postoffice Committee chairmen, the Post*
master-General and two citizens, to be
appointed by the President, and which
shall make its report to the next Con
gress. He made a statement about the
hearings given by the Senate Postoffice
Committee on tho Loud bill and said that
the committee had come to the conclu
sion that it was impossible to have any
legislation on the aubj-ci at the present
session and that a commission should be
created as proposed.
At 3:30 Allison proposed that there be a
recess from 6 to 8 o'clock this evening,
and it was agreed to.
The discussion of Chandler's substitute
was continued.
Stewart (Silver) of Nevada complained
of the low cost at which newspapers were
carried through the mails, ridiculing p;tr
ticularly the Sunday newspapers, which
were so heivy and voluminous that some
penons refused to take them for nothing.
On the other hand, he said, educational
literature, like pamphlets on silver, was
boycotted by the Po-toiflce Departm nt.
Duboi* (Silver) of Idaho took advantage
of the backward condition of the appro
priation bills to make a speech in advo
cacy of his proposition of last session to
distribute thÂ«Â« appropriation bills among
the committees haying change of the vari

to Senators or tun people. "The Republi
can party," he went on, ''cannot oreanize
the Senate next session. The Senators
known as Silver Republicans will not co
operate with you. You have no power to
organize tbe Senate."
"To whom do you refer as 'you?' " Nel
son (R.) of Minnesota asked.
"I am referring to the Republicans,"
Duhois replied.
"What have you got against them?"
NeKon queried.
"I have this against them," Duhois re
plied. "You have been stating for sev
eral years that you would heip us to make
the fignt for silver. But you came out at
St. Louis as the advocate of the single
gold standard. And when you did that
you 10-t â as you were then warned â the
Pacific Coast Bs na tors. Just so fast as the
people of that section have elections for
Senators will Republicans to down. There
have been seven Senators elected there to
take the place of seven Republicans, and
one Republican Senator came back.
"And jusi bo olten as tbe people of the
Panne Coast have tbe cnance to express
themselves will you loss a Republican
Senator if you cling to the single god
standard. You cannot organize the next
Senate. You cannot oreanize any other
Senate. As was said at St. Louis, the Re
publican party as a party has written its
last Jaw on the statute-books of this
country. If you get your tariff bill
tnrough it will not be by Republican
votes. You hove not got them. Tuey do
not belong to you and you will be farther
from getting tbem acer two years."
Hill (D. ) of New York spoke in opposi
tion to Allison's amendment and in favor
of Chandler's substitute.
Alii.-on facetiously expressed bis satis
faction at the advice given by the Sena
tors as neither of t em would be in a po
sition t<> advise the Senate next session.
He argue I in support of his proposition.
Th? discussion was continual, by Cui
lom (R )of Illinois, Carter (K. ) of Mon
tana. Chandler (R. ) of New Hampshire,
Burrows (R.) of Michigan, Hawley (R.)
of Connc t.cut. Aldnch (R.) of Rhode Is
land, E kins (R.) ot West Virginia and
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts.
Most of tho arguments were in support
of the Chandler substitute, but Hoar ex
p.essed his disapprobation of such mired
commissions. The question was not de
cided when the hour arrived for taking a
recess.
The House amendments to the Senate
bill vacating the Sugar Loaf reservoir site
in Colorado and to restore the lands to
public entry were concurred in, and the
uili now goes to the President.
Daniel (R.) of Virginia presented and
asked leave to have printed in tiie Record
the naturalization papers of Julio Sau
guiliy, with an extract from the laws on
the subject of the naturalization of aliens
and Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts also ob
tained leave io have printed extracts from
other sec;i<.ns of the law.
At 6 P. k. the Senate took a recess until
8 o'clock.
After the recess a number of private bills
were passed and then Quay (R.) of Penn
sylvania endeavored to obtain unanimous
consent for the consideration of the bill
forbidding the sale of 1 quors in the Capi
tol, but Hili (D.) ol New York oojected.
The postoffice appropriation bill was then
taken up.
Gorman (D.) of Maryland opposed the
amendment of Chandler, providing for a
civilian commission. He contended that
wbie tbe execunve was constantly crying
out against the extravagance of Congress
tne ministers appointed by him were -end
ing in estimates to Coneress lar beyond
the necessities of their departments.
While all the departments had full legal
power to institute reforms and practice
economy they never took advantage of
these rights, but all recent reforms had
been inaugurated by Congressional com
missions.
> fter trying in vain to obtain a vote on
the Postal Coromisrion amendment, Alli
son, in view of the tact that the protracted
debate was imperiling not only this bill,
but ail the great appropriation bills un
acted upon, moved to lay the amendment
on the table. It was agreed to.
Butler (Pop.) of North Caro'ina moved
to strike out the item of $171,250 for fast
mail ssrvice between New York, Atlanta
and New Orleans. He made an argument
of nearly two hours' duration against the
Ringing in the ears is one of the certain signs or symp-
toms of a decline of power or nervous debility. When in
this condition you will find the great and certain cure is the
reliable remedy treatment, Hudyan. Hudyan is a remedy
treatment especially efficacious in premature weakness.
When you notice the first sign or symptom of a premature
condition, or of a premature weakness you should make
certain to use the remedy treatment that is world-wide, and
that remedy treatment is Hudyan. Hudyan cures night
losses, pimples, drains ; Hudyan cures depression of spirits,
bashfulness, inability to look frankly into the eyes of another ;
Hudyan cures headache, hair falling* out, dimness of sight,
noises in the head and ears, weak memory, loss of voice,
taste or smell ; Hudyan cures sunken eyes, stunted growth,
premature weakness, palpitation ; Hudyan cures tremblings,
noises in the head, twitchings, facial twitchings, loss of
muscular power, gloomy, melancholy forebodings and
disturbed sleep.
HUDYAN CAN BE HAD
From the doctors of the Hudson Medical Institute and from
no one else. You need Hudyan when the facial nerves
twitch ; you need Hudyan when there is a decline of nerve
force, because this decline shows a lack of nerve life, and
when the nerves begin to lose their strength you may look
out for nervous debility. If you have harassed your nerves,
if you have gnarled or knotted your nerves, if you have dis-
sipated or abused yourself you should recover with the
Great Hudyan Remedy Treatment.
No One Else Can Give You Hudyan But
THE HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE.

Jillman (D.)ot bou b Uru 1:1 a defended
the provision and declared Butler's argu
ment a piece of sentimentality. He said
tiiere was entirely too much sentimental

more practicability.
This was followed by a war and rapid
exchange of compliments between the
Senators ot the two auj Â«iriine States.
But er's arnondment was defeated.
The postoffico appropriation bill was
then passed and the sundry civil bilt taken
up.
At 12:45 a. M., after a number of unsuc
cessiul attempts by hill to have an hour
fixed on Monday for holdin- an executive
session for the consideration of nomina
tions, it was agreed that at 2:30 a. m. the
Senate should take a recess until 3 o'clock
Sun lay afternoon.
The sundry civil bill consideration waÃ
then resumed.
At 2 o'clock there were but few Senators
present to listen to the monotonous read
ing of the clerk. At that hoar he had
covered about naif t;;e 134 pages con
tained in the bill. Items to which objec
tion was offered were passed over without
action.
At 2:30 a. m. tl c reading of the sundry
civil bili was finished and the Senate took
a recess until 3 a. m
ANTI-SCALPER VICTORY.
Bill raise* thÂ« Home by More Than a
Itco- Ihirrt* Majority.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27âIn the
House to-day the following bills were
passed: Gran ing right of-way through
tne Spokane Military Reservation, Wash
ington, to the St. Paul, Minneapolis and
Manitoba Railroad; to vacate the Sugar
loaf Reservoir site No. 5 in Lake County,
Colo., Â»n<i restore it 10 the public domain ;
establishing a land office at Kuiupiel,
Moat.
Senate amendments to the bill allowing
the bmtling of distilled sp rils in b -nd
were concurred in, and the bill now go s
to the President.
Sherman (R.) of New York called up
the ami-scalping bill. It proposes an
amendment to tne interstate commerce act
and forbids (he sale of railroad tickets by
any o her than a regularly appointed
agent of the company issuing the tickets.
Morthway (R.) of Ohio raised the ques
tion of consideration and on an aye and
no vote the House decidedâ ls2 to 70â to
consider the bill.
Sherman proposed an amendment the
effect ot which would be to give persons
purchasing tickets the right to sell them
to othor persons who will actually use
them for passage.
Sherman moved the previous question
and pending that endeavored to make an
arrang ment to limit the debate, first pro
posing an hour and a half and again two
hours, but the opponents or the bill de
clined to accept less than three hours and
Sherman insisted upon bis motion for the
previous question.
Bowers (R.) of California moved to ad
journ and on this motion the ayes and
noes were taken, the opponents of the bill
evincing a determination to tight it with
every possible weapon all along the line.
The motion to adjourn was lost and the
previous question was then ordered. The
amendments offered by Sherman were
aureed to and then he reviewed the pro
visions of the bill.
The engrossment and third reading of
the bill was ordered and the reading of
the engrossed copy was demanded. To
secure this a wait of some minutes was
necessary.
The House refused to consider the bill
authorizing the Posi master-General to
lest the merit of the postal card and
envelopes with coupons attached, patented
by the United States Economic Postal
Association, which was to be admitted to
the mails under the regulations to be is
sued by the Postmaster-General.
The engrossed copy of the anti-scalpers
bill having been received, it was read.
Bailey (D.) of Texas moved to recommit,
the bill with instructions. Rejectedâ 46
to 130. The bill was then passedâ l 42 to 51.
The House then, at 5:40, adjourned uutii
Monday at noon.

An Imputation That Honest
Senators Were Bribed
Resented.
DENUNCIATION OF THE
MEN BESMIRCHED.
Morehouse, Chapman and Franck
Denounce the Malicious Lies
â¢ of the "Examiner."
THEY WILL PRCBE THE MATTER
TO THE BOTTOM.
Representatives of H arst's San Fran*
Cisco "Freak" May Be Put Out
of the Legislature.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.,' Feb. 27.âWith
out the slightest foundation in fact, but
with' an imagination born of malice and
vindictiveness, the "Monarch of the
Fakers" in the course of its everyday pas
time of faking, to-day made wholesale
charges of bribery against the members
of both the Senate and the Assembly.
' So contemptible were tbe falsehoods
contained in the article in question and
so flagrant was the violation of all the
written and unwritten rules of decency
that there was a general outburst of in
dignation on the part of every Senator
present, and on the floor of the Senate the
article was denounced as a "willful, un
mitigated, damn lie," and the author as
'â¢'an unmitigated, malicious scoundrel.''
The ostensible inspiration for the article
was the passage of Assembly bill 273, in
troduced by Caminetti, adding to section
170 of the Code of Civil Procedure the pro
vision that no Justice, Judge or Justice of
the Peace shall sit or act as such in any
action or proceeding "when it appears
; from the affidavit of either party that he
has reason to believe, and does believe,
that he cannot have a fair and impartial
trial before the Juatice or Judge about to
try tne .case, by reason of the prejudice or
bias of such Justice or Judge."
1$ is charged by the Examiner that the
object of the bill is to prevent Judge Heb
.bard from sitting in the Hale & Norcross
' case, should it be ordered back by the
Supreme Court for retrial. Here is the
language of that pu_si]lanmious 'creation,
evolved from the fad of "new journalism":
Plainly coin baa been used to crowd through
the Legislature a bill capable of enabling
. Aivinza Hay ward and h!s Hale <fe NorcroM fol
lowing to oust Judge Hebhard Irom the great
case in which they have been adjudged guilty
of gigantic frauds.
At present the Hale & Norcross case is before
the Supreme Court. Should that tribunal find
gome error in the rulings of the court below
the cause would be sent back for rehearing.
Herein 'arises the eagerness of the defendants
to be placed in a position where they shall
not have, in such a contingency, to face the
Judge who knows them to the core.
, It then makes unsupported statements
as follows:
Without a shadow of a doubt members of
the Assembly and members of the Senate were
bribed to support the bill. The price paid for
each vote bought in the lower House was
$150. In the Senate a vote brought all the
way from $ 350 to $500.
After giving the history of the bill in
Senate, the article concludes with the fol
lowing cowardly insinuations:
Prisk, Pedlar, Langford and Dwyer, who
were absent when the roll was called on Tues
day, voted for the bill. Chapman, Franck and
Morehouse, who had voted against allowing
the Bill a third reading, cast their votes for the
passage of the measure.
. The San Francisco papers arrived bat a
short time before the adjournment of the
Senate until Monday, and there was con
sequently but little time during the ses
sion lor the members to read and digest
thearticle in question. It was only when
the motion to adjourn was pending that
Senator Morehouse arose to a question of
privilege, and with voice vibrating with
intense indignation gave vent to his feel
ings as follows:
â  "Before that motion is put I would like
to call the attention of the Senators to an
article that appeared in the San Francisco
Examiner this morning headed 'Bribery
in AidÂ»of Thieves,' and in which there
are statements that upon certain measures
here members of the Senate have been
i I -ibed for their votes. I desire to say that
I â  far as lam concerned that article is a
I â a willful, unmitigated, damned lie â
\ d the man who wrote it is an unmiti
gated, malicious scoundrel. I have come
here honestly and have Honestly voted on
every measure in this body. No man has
approached me under any circumstance,
and I tbink that is so in regard to every
member of the Senate."
After the adjournment the matter was
the sole topic of indignant and denuncia
tory remark about the Capitol.
fhe absurdity of the whole story and
the exceedingly thin fabric out of which
it had been constructed is shown by the
character of the men whom it sought
to more directly connect by invidi
ous inuuendo with its infamous
charge, viz. : Morehouse, .Franck and
.Chapman. These are the men who are
stated to have changed their votes in
favor of the bill after having once voted
against it.
Franck is a resident of Santa Clara
County, a man whose wealth is estimated
at between $200,000 ana $300,000 and whose
honesty and integrity have always been
above suspicion.
Morehouse is also a man of means,' and
stands high in the proiession which he
honors, and is one of the leading attorneys
of his section. In Santa Clara, bis home,
no man bears a better private and
(public reputation. His public record is
pne that any man might feel Droud of. So
[well have his services on behalf of the
people been appreciated, that his name is
even now prominently mentioned in con
nection with'the nomination for the high
office of Governor of this State two years
fcence.
Chapman represents Â£1 Dorado and
Placer counties, is a miner, has an irre
proachable character, is worth in the
neighborhood of $250,0Q0, and was onlj
induced to stand for the Senatorship in
his district by the persistent demands of
his friends.
Three men of higher standing or purer
reputation on whom to cast its venom the
Examiner could not have selected from
the entire list of forty Senators. And it is
this fact that has aroused the Senate and
permeated the hearts of all with a sense
of outraged decency and justice.
This feeling will find expression on
Monday in a movement looking to a com
plete and thorough investigation of the
matter with the purpose of inflicting such
chastisement on the guilty persons as is in
the power of the Senate and as their con
duct deserves. Among the methods pro
pos- d to be adopted is the exclusion from
the floor of the Senate of the entire staff of
the Examiner.
Senator Morebouse will take the lead in
the matter of the investigation. He is de
termined to leave no stone unturned to
b ing his traducers to time and to demon
strate to the world at large the falsity of
the imputed charges. In an interview
this afternoon he said:
"All that I know of the measure is that
there were two similar ones before the
Judiciary Committee of the Senate which
were strongly recommended by the Dis
trict Attorney of Madera County. Judge
Conlan of Madera County felt that they
were personal attacks on him, therefore in
the Judiciary Committee I took strong
action aeainst both measures and they
were not reported favorably by the Ju
diciary Committee. Afterward, here upon
the floor of the Senate, the bill from the
Assembly known as the Caminetti bill
came up on second reading, and I moved
to strike out the fourth clause and ad
dressed the Senate in opposition to the
measure.
"When it came up on third reading
Senator Langford of San Joaquin came to
me and said if I had no personal interest
in the bill he wished I would vote for it,
as it was a matter of great moment to
him. I informed him I bad no interest in
the measure one way or the other, and
while I did not believe personally in such
legislation I could not see that serious in
jury would result in passing the bill,
therefore I would accommodate him and
vote for it. About the same time I re
ceived a dispatch from a personal friend
saying that if I bad no special interest in
the bill it would be a matter of favor to
him if I would support it, and not having
any interest in it one way or other I cast
my vote for the measure.
"But in reading the article in the Ex
aminer this morning the only inference to
be drawn is that all persons who voted for
the bill, and particularly myself. Senators
Franck, Chapman, Pedlar, Prisk and
Dwyer, had received money for their votes
from one of the parties interested in some
litigation in San Francisco.
"As for myself nothing was ever Â«aid to
me at any time concerning the matter
spoken of in the Examiner, and I knew of
no motive other than I have heretofore
stated for the bill. I have only had one am
bition in life and that was to reach public
honors and so conduct myself in public
positions as to leave a reputation to my
wife and children that would be an honor
to them and a credit to the State, and I
hold this dearer than life itself.
"I feel that this is an unwarranted at
tack, and was intended lo injure and de
fame me and other gentlemen of the t?en
ate. But if my associates will stand by
me I will have this matter probed to the
bottom and find out the source of this in
formation, and, having found it out, 1 will
take such means to rectify it as the law
will permit, and if the law does not per
mit, 1 shall take such means ss God Al
mighty gave me the right to exercise.
"This Senate from the beginning has
been one of credit to the State, and so far
as I know, every member of it has sought
to do his duty and to maintain a reputa
tion for personal honor and integrity that
wuuld be above reproach. Senator Franck,
the other Senator from my county, is a
man of unimpeachable integrity, of large
wealth, and whose honesty no man can
question.
"The other Senators I am not bo well
acquainted with as I am with Senator
Franck, but I am satisfied that they are
absolutely innocent and that this is a pure
joke, gotten up for the purpose of casting
a slur on the reputation of reputable mem
bers and probably for political effect, ow
ing to the fact that a majority of the Sen
ators are Republicans.
"If this is to be Democratic politics the
sooner the Republican members of the
Senate discover the fact the better.
At any rate the time has arrived in the
history of this State when fake journalism
and lying correspondent! snould be taught
a ler-on.
"I have no fear of any large newspaper
or its attacks upon me, as my whole life
has been one of toil and struggle, and 1
have never in my life been guilty of a dis
honorable act, therefore there is nothing
in my personal record why I should fear
the public press, and I know that my in
tegrity is proof against false attacks. I
am sorry that this occurred so Jate in the
session, as else I would prepare and in
troduce a measure which, if the Legisla
ture would pass, would prevent future
attacks of this kind made on public
men."
Senator Franck concurred in all that
his colleague said and stated that he
would heartily co-operate with Morehouse
in any effort to run the false report lo
earth and punish the offenders. Senator
Linder is one of ttie legislators who voted
for the bill. After hearing what Senator
Morehouie had to say he remarked:
"I heartily indorse and concur in Sen
ator Morehouse' s statement and in addi
tion to that 1 had a personal reason for
oting for that measure. I had a building
contract some four years ago and a con
tract on which the contractor fell short or
appropriated the money to his own use
and failed to pay the workmen.
â¢â¢In consequence the laborers brought a
lien suit and the Judge in my county.
Cross by name, who is a Democrat and
very partisan, decided that the contract
was all right and that I should only have
to pay tne contract Drice, but he gave
judgment against me for costs, etc.,
amounting to $1200 or $1300."
Those who are best informed declare
that the Examiner's publication was sim
ply intended to influence the Governor to
veto the bill in question, and that it cared
not who was bespattered with its shine so
long as it accomplished its object.
Senator Seawell, tne leader of the Demo
cratic minority, voted for the bill, and de
clared tiiat the provisions of it are em
bodied in the laws of nearly every State
in the Union. He added that no undue
influence was necessary to carry it, as it
was a sufficiently good measure to win on
its merits.

LEGISLATING FOR
MINING INTERESTS
Numerous Measures Look
ing to a Revival of the
Industry.
Soward's Amendment to Debris
Commissioner Act Is Most
Important
As a Law It Would Restore the State
to Its Former Place as a
Gold- Prod ncer.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 27.â Hon.
F. D. Bo ward, chairman of the Committee
on Mines and Mining Interests in the As
sembly, in talking about mining legisla
tion and the needs of the miners, said:
"The thirty-ie cond session of the Cali
fornia Legislature has before it an un
usual amount of mining legislation. This,
no doubt, is brought about by the revival
in minine noticeable in nil of the mining
sections in the State. The bill known as
Soward's amendment to the Debris Com
missioner a ct of 1893 is the most import
ant. Upon It depends the outlay in this
State of a; half million dollars in the
building of 'works for the restraining or
impounding of debris resulting from miv
ing operations, natural erosion or other
causes.'
"One-half of this money is to be paid
by California and the other half thereof
by the United States Each appropria
tion is in a measure oepeudent upon the
other, and as the National appropriation
is for a somewhat different purpose from
that of the State appropriation under the
Ford Act of 1893, the Sovrard amendment
is necessary so as to make the purposes of
the two appropriations conform.
"This large amount of money is to be
expended under the direction and control
of the Federal Engineers constituting the
Federal Debris Commission, pursuant to
section 25 of the Caminetti act.
"In June, 1896, the present National
river and narbor bill became a law, and
in so far as it affects the appropriation un
der consideration it provides:
For the construction of restraining barriers
for the protection of the Sacramento and
Fc.nthorjrivers in California, $250,U00, such
restraining barriers to be constructed under
the direction of the Secretary of War in ac
cordance with the recommendations of the
California Debris Commission, pursuant to
the provisions ot und for the purposes set
forth in section 35 of the act of Congress of
the United States, entitled "An Act to create
the California Debris Commission and regu
late hydraulic minim: in the State of Caliior
nia," approved March 1. 1893; provided, th-u
the Treasurer of the United states be ami he
is hereby authorized to receive from the Slate
of Ca.ifornia, through the Debris CoaualMion
of said State, or other officer thereunto duly
authorized, any and all sums of money tua't
have been or may thereafter oe appropriated
by said Say for the purposes herein set forth.
And said sums when so received are hereby
appropriated for th<^ purposes above named,
to be expended in the manner above provided.
"The bill known as the Dredrer bill,
asking for an appropriation of $300,000,
now pending before the Legislature, is a
companion bill to the Soward amend
ment, ana the miners and farmers have
both heartily joined in supporting Doth
measures.
"For the first time in many years the
representatives of the miners and the
farmers have worked together in accom
plishing the same ends. The old animosi
ties have been buried, and both seek to
adjust their differences upon friendly

ONLY A TEMPEST
IN A TEAPOT
There Is No "joker" in
the Bill for a State
Census.
Los Angeles NeeJ Not Fear Get
ting Rated as a City of
the First Class.
Republican Leaders Too Wide Awak. 1
to Give tha Democratic Gov
ernor More Patronage.
BAQRAMENTO. Oal., Feb. 27.âAccord
ing to a dispatch in this morning's Call
from Los Angeles the people of that city
fear that the municipal census bill, which
has just become a law, has a "joker" in it
and that by reason of it Los Angeles will
become a city of the first class and entitled
to all ihe privileges and subject to all the
duties of a city of that kind.
The particular thing that causes appre
hension in the southern metropolis is
that if the census of Los Angeles, taken
under the new law, should show it to
have a population of 100,000, it will be put
in the same category as San Francisco,
and will give the Governor in that case
the appointment of a Police Commission.
a Board of Health and other officials, and
will, in fact, give him in a large measure
the municipal patronage of that city,
thus opening many desirable positions for
Democrats.
There is absolutely no ground for these
fears, as no such conditions will result as
have been conjured up by some one who
is evidently not in the confidence of the
Republican leaders of that city. Senator
Bulla o! Los Angeles is the author of the
municipal census bill and thus explains
the situation :
"In the first place, I want to say that
the situation does not, in my opinion,
need any explanation. It was fully under
stood by the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce, the Merchants' and Manufac
turers' Association and the business men
and people generally in Los Angeles, that
this bill would be introduced.
"The Federal Government required a
statute of that kind to be passed before it
would increase the mail carrier service,
which was absolutely necessary by reason
of the enlargement of the ciiy boundary
and the phenomenal growth of the city
since the taking of the last Federal census.
"We had to provide a general statute
for the taking of the census in order to
meet the requirements of ihe Federal
Government for that purpose alone.
There was a statute which, in my judg
ment, would have given the State power
to do just what this bill that has passed
gives them power to do, but the Federal
authorities wanted a bill passed in this
form, and as we were obliged to satisfy
them before we could get our increased

number oi carriers and the . increase of
salaries or compensation of such carriers,
the bill was prepared, thoroughly dis
cussed, introduced and finally passed.
"The question of its effect upon tho class
of Los Angeles was also fully considered
and discussed, and it was the opinion of
eood lawyers that unless the city took
further steps to place itself within the
first class it would not be so classified,
notwithstanding that the census, taken
under the passed bill should show a popu
lation of over 100,000. Personally i had
grave doubts as to the correctness of this
position, and in order to avoid any pos
sible question I prepared and introduced
another bill raising the population of
cities of the tint class from 100,000 to
L'oo,ooo.
"That bill has passed the Senate and is
now before the Assembly, where it will
undoubtedly receive favorable considera
tion, as the representatives from ban
Francisco are all satisfied with it, and the
Governor will doubtless sign. the same
promptly when it reaches him.
"1 know personally that the motives of
Postmaster Mathews were perfectly
proper and commendable, and Ido not
think it ever entered the mind of any one
connected with the effort to meet the re
quirement of our situation that political
capital would or should be made by the
introduction or passage of the bill. 1 hold
it is a tempest in a teapot and unworthy
of any further consideration."

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 27. â The
Senate this morning devoted most of its
time to the second reading of bills carry

Senator Storehouse, rising to a question
of personal privilege, denounced the ar
ticle published in the San Francisco Ex

Morehouse declared he will have the

Some Important Orders Have
Been Prepared by the War
Department.
Legislating Regarding Retirements
to Increase the Efficiency of
the Army anl Navy.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.-An
important order has been prepared at the
War Department relating to the inspec
tion of coast and other defenses by civil
ians. The order will be issued at once.
It will provide that hereafter civilians
cannot visit fortifications except upon
written passes signed by proper authority,
and that such permission is not to bo
granted except for military reasons. The
reason for such an order is obvious when
it is remembered that many of the coun
try's points of defense are nearing the
stage of completion when their character,
extent, etc., would be valuable informa
tion to foreign powers.
General Doe said to-day that he had
conferred with the adjutant-general with
regard to the enlistment and discharge
blanks, with the result that the adjutant
general had made a number of sugges
tions. He now agrees with the assistant
secretary regarding the main points, and
that is that the honorable discharge be
printed on parchment and the dishonor
able on paper. The matter has now been
referred to General Miles again, and
General Doe hones to have some action
taken in the matter.
The Senate Committee on Commerce,
through Senator Caffery, has reported to
the Senate a proposed amendment to the
sundry civil appropriation bill for the
fiscal year, in which officers of corps of
engineers will be interested. The amend
ment has been referred to the Committee
on Appropriations for consideration. It
reads as follows: "Officers of the army
traveling on duty connected with works
of internal improvement shall be paid
mileage from appropriations therefor;
provided, that hereafter the maximum
sum to be allowed and paid such officer
or officers shall be 4 cents per mile, the
distance to be computed over the shortest
usually traveled route, and in addition
thereto transportation in kind shall be
furnished.
The bill proriding for the retirement of
bluejackets, etc., which passed the Senate
on the 11th inst, has been favorably re
ported to the House with an amendment
reading that retirement is to be author
ized, provided the man ban attained the
age of 55 years. In its amended form the
bill reads as follows: "That when an en
listed man serves thirty years in the
United States army or marine corps, or as
an enlisted man or appointed petty officer
in the United States navy, ne shall, pro
vided he has attained the age of 55 years,
by making application to tne President,
be placed upon the retired list with 75
per centum of his pay and allowance of
rank or rate upon whicu he was re
tired; provided that all active ser
vice in the United States army,
navy or marine corps during time
of war, insurrection or rebellion shall
be computed as double time in computing
the thirty years necessary to entitle the
applicant to be retired; provided further,
that all honorable service in the United
Statei army, navy and marine corps shall
be computed as within the period neces
sary -to entitle the applicant to retire un
der the provisions of this act."
Hilborn of the Committee on Naval
Affairs submitted the report to the House.
The report contains several extracts from
a report on the same bill presented by
Meyer.
As the hoDe of the proposed reward
would be an inducement to enlisted men
to make good records for themselves, their
general efficiency and value to the service
at large would be greatly enhanced. A
letter from Secretary Herbert also ap
pears is the report. Herbert says that if
the bill becomes a law it will undoubtedly
cause the best men to remain in tlie naval
service and will be a strong inducement
to American citizens to enlist. In the
communication Herbert suggested that a
provision bs inserted reading, "provided
he is 50 years of age."
The opinion of Admiral Ramsey is
quoted in the report to the effect that the
provision for retirement will be a great
inducement for men to remain in the
service, knowing that they will be pro
vided for after serving faithfully the al
lotted period of thirty years.
Following are the concluding remarks
in the report: "From this cause alone,
therefore, it is in every way probable that
the saving in recruiting expenses, not to
mention the advantage of keeping in the
naval service its veteran enlisted men, will
far more than make up the expense in
volved in a retired list. For the above
reasons, and believing that this is a step
which would be taken, not merely to do
justice to the enlisted men of the navy,
who have heretofore been forgotten
(though their officers have long enjoyed a
retired list, and enlisted men in the army,
as well as officers, have been similarly
favored), but as a matter of public policy â
to improve the morals of the army and
offer greater inducements for enlistment
of the increasing numbers thnt will be
found necessary to man the new ships now
building and contemplatedâ the com
mittee believes that there should be pro
vided a retired list for enlisted men and
petty officers In the navy." *
NAVAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
Allows $250,000 for Dredging the Chan-
net in Mare Island Strait.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 27.â The
naval appropriation bill as reported to the
Senate to-day carries a total of 185.728,000,

items of increase are: Dredging the chan
nel in Mare Island Btrait, California, $250,
--000. and establishing a Government armor
factory, $2,500,000. The provision for an
armor- plate factory gives the Secretary
authority in case he finds it impossible to
contract for armor within the limits of
the price fixed by the bill (S4OO a ton).

FRED SCHINEER
WINS THE RACE
Rather Tame Ending of the
Six- Day Contest at
Chicago.
Miller Was Twenty-Six Miles
Behind the Winner and
Could Not Spurt.
More Dead Than Alive the Wheelmen
Appeared at the Finish to
Receive the Prizes.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb.27.-Pred Bchineer,
the Bohemian and a resident of this city,
won the six-day bicycle race at Tatter
;â¢ all's, which ended to-night at 10:05
o'clock. The final contestants and the
distances they covered were as follows:
Scbineer, 17SS miles 4 laps; Miller of
Chicago, 1764 miles 1 lap; Ashinger, 1727
miles; Lawsor, the "Terrible Swede," 1707
miles 1 lap; Hanson, 1603 miles 8 laps;
ll iff, the legless rider, 461 miles.
There was no exciting finish for the
thousands of people in the stifling build
ing to go into eostacies of delight and
make an uproar over. The contest prac
tically terminated at 9 o'clock to-night.
Miller was then twenty-six miles behind
the winner, and Ashinger, the veteran
rider of long distances, had thirty-six
miles to Rain on the second-placo man.
Miller was physically unequal to close
the distance gap in the final hour set for
the racers to drop out, confident that
Ashinger could not get the best of him.
Schineer was glad of the chance to quit
and retain his grip on the $1000 purse, and
one by one the half-dozen hall-dead rac
ers dropped from their wheels and sought
their quarters.
For a time the mass of spectators had
nothing to do except listen to the music
and gaze at the empty track. Feeble in
terest was revived by tne reappearance of
the prize-winners, who did a few sleepy
turns, looking more like men in a trance
than contesting professional athletes.
Exhausted in body and mind the riders
quicily sought their couches. They were
rewarded for their brief return by being
made the recipients of liberal applause
and bouquets of flowers. Miller and Schi
neer, the two Chicagoans, made a theatri
cal display of their intention to call it a
race by riding arotind arm in arm and
bearing some of their floral tributes. Law
son and Ashinger came out and did the
same act.
The next diversion came when the stair
way leading from the bridge over the
track fell beneath its load of human
freight. The fall was not enough to more
than bruise those who were caught, but
there was intense excitement for a few
minutes. City building inspectors and
the police found it necessary to clear
away the dangerous wooden superstruc
tures, which were of the lightest construc
tion.
At 9:45 all the riders reappeared and
added a few laps to their scores an a final
measure. At the time set for the finish
all lined up in front of Fred Gerlach of
the L. A. \V. and received their prizes in
gold from two ladies. All of them had
the appearance of victims of consumption
in various stages of the disease, except
tbat the vitality in their eyes resemble I
that of dead fish. They were pitied as
much as applauded. It is claimed that
Schineer rested thirteen hours out of the
142.
STOCKTON'S ANGRY DOG-FANCIERS
Because Me Insulted the Kennel Club,
Mason Will Not Preside at a
Dog Show.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 27.â The Stock
ton Kennel Club, at its meetine to-night
annulled its agreement to employ Mason
as judge at the coming bench show at a
salary o! $400 on account of an article
which recently appeared in his paper, the
New York Turf, Field and Farm, and was
reproduced in the Btockton Mail. In It
Mason said:
"Only recently the secretary of a club,
which gave a show of 150 dogs, advised
another club that if a certain man was not
encaged to judge its show not one dog
from the town in which he lived would be
exhibited, and instead of showing up the
impudent dictator the club actually
heeded the threat. If this is not rotten
ness complete we wonder what it is."
The letter referred to was written to the
Stockton club by Secretary Simpson of
the Sacramento club, and the remark is
construed by the former organization as
an insult to itself. It is supposed that
Mason wrote the article while under the
impression that Fellows, the judge alluded
to, was to be appointed exclusively and
that he himself would not be "in it" at
the Stockton show. The club is talking of
increasing the pay of Fellows, who was to
judge for $125 in connection with Mason,
to |200 now that he will be the sole judge.
NEW YORK BOXING CONTESTS.
Three Event Before the Broadway Ath
letic Club.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 27.-The box
ing entertainment held at the Broadway
Athletic Clnb this evening attracted
nearly 2000 people to the clubhouse. The
principal "go" was between Johnny Gor
man of New York and Jack Reid of Ire
land for fifteen rounds at 150 pounds. The
fighting was in favor of Reid throughout.
In the fourteenth round he would have
put his man out but for the gong. Reid
was awarded the decision at the end of the
bout.
The preliminary bout, ten rounds at 116
pounds, between Dave O'Connor of Patter
son and Benny Leon of New York was
awarded to Leon in the fourtn round.
The second go, between Nick Collins of
New York and Eddie Sweeney of Brook
lyn, ten rounds at 130 pounds, was award
ed to Sweaney on a foul in the fourth
round.

ready for occupancy â next Fall â we would be much pleased to again
have you as tenants, as our past relations have been of the most
friendly nature. Trusting you will not be heavy losers by our

chise Believed to Hays Been

PASADENA, Cal., Feb. 27.â The town

â franchise and pprt of the route is on
Colorado s'.reet, which the old franchise
' Covered.

force of men at work building a line to
cover this ground, although by the terms
of the franchise its ripht had been for
feited. The Terminal got out an injunc
tion restraining the work, but it was dis
solved this evening and a big force is at
work again.
A largely attended mass-meeting was
held this evenin?. and it was unanimously
requested of the City Council that the old j
franchise be declared forfeited. The opin
ion of the citizens i.<? almost unanimous '
that the franchise should be sold to the |
highest bidder.

FREE FIGHT AT SALINAS.
Drunken Roughs Attack a Wedding Anni
versary Parly and Hubs An
Vigorously Wielded.
SALINAS, Cal., Feb. 27.â The Grutli
Hotel was on "Wednesday night the scene
of a wedding pany which enaed in a most
peculiar and disastrous manner. A. Belli,
a Swiss and the proprietor of the hotel,
and his wife were celebrating the eigh
teenth anniversary of their marriage, and
the freedom of the house and all it con
tained was extended to all who counted
tntmselvea friends of the couple. About
12 o'clock, just when the merriment was
at its height," a party of men entered and
boisterously called for drinks. Belli
walked behind the bar and prepared to
give them their drinks free of cost, as he
had done for every one else that night,
when his wife ?Doke to him, telling him
not to give the liquor free and warning
turn that the men were there to make
trouble.
Belli then turned to the men and asked
who was i oing to pay for it, and, receivi ng
no answer, he refused to put up the drinks.
Then some one put a dog upon the bar
and when Belli pushed it off another of
the men tried to strike him over the head
with a demijohn of claret. Belli dodeed,
the demijohn came down on the counter,
and glass and wine flew over everything.
While this was going on Mrs. Belli was
having considerable trouble with another
of The men whom she had tried to put out
of the door. Belli came from behind the
bar to her assistance. Several of the men
seized him and he was rescued by his
Swiss friends.
The tight then became general, the
Swiss guests of the host taking part in hit
behalf, and beer-bottles and glasses flew
about in lively fashion. Three windows
were smashed before the men who began
the trouble could ba driven out, aim all
the rest of the windows were wrecked by
bricks and stones wnich the ejected ones
threw into the house. Nightwatchman
Condon, who tried to stop the brawl, was
soon silenced by a blaw in the neck from
a burly fist, and as no other officer ap
peared upon the scene the melee contin
ued undisturbed until all parties had bad
satisfaction.
Yesterday several arrests were made
and in the afternoon those in custody
were arraigned before Judge Road bouse
and ail pleaded not guilty. Their trial is
set for next Tuesday.

TO PLEAD FOR AN ALASKA OUTLAW
Judge Leisure of Portland Starts for
Juneau to Defend Murderer
Birch.
PORTLAND, Ok., Feb. 27â Judge John
C. Leisure of this city left to-night for
Juneau, Alaska, to defend Bob Birch, an
owner of very rich mining property, for
tho murder of Deputy Sheriff Wade.
About a year ago Birch was sentenced
to three years' imprisonment ana a fine
of $500 on the charge of mayhem. The
three Birch brothers engaged in a fight
with another two one night, and just as
Bob Birch's assailant was about to get the
better of him, Birch tried to bite the man's
nose ofl, and succeeded so well that the
assailant had good ground for a personal
damaze suit.
While in jail in Juneau waiting to bo
taken to the SiUa penitentiary Birch'a
friends broke into the prison and liber
ated him. The delivery was accom
plished quietly and without demonstra
tion. A Sheriff's posse was organized, and
shortly afterward started on a search for
Birch. He was located in a lonely cabin
in the mountains one night, as the fa
miliar story of tragedy run*. He is a des
perate man ana the deputies Knew it, so
they began snooting into the oabin, talc
in great chances on getting their man
alive. Birch opened his cabin door and
began to shoot with two revolvers. The
posse got such a hot reception that it re
treated.
Deputy Sheriff Wade was badly
wounded by a shot through the leg. He
was deserted by his treacherous associ
ates, who fled for their lives. Wade
crawled away some distance, crossed a lit
tle creek, and then sat up against a tree
to rest. When he was found a day or two
later he was frozen stiff in a sitting posi
tion against the tree. The rescuing party
came too late.
One of the strong points to be used by
the defense is that Birch did not Kill
Wadeâ that as a matter of fact Wade may
have frozen to death.
RIDDING FRESNO OF BURGLARS.
Two Man Recently' Arrested Confess to a
Number of Recent Midnight
Raids.
FRESNO. Cal.. Feb. 27. -When Officer
Anderson and Deputy Constable Albin
caucht Fred Slocum and George Howard
in the act oi looting Putigian's second
hand store on I street a few nights aeo
they made captures which prove to have
been very important.
It has been ascertained that these two
men were the perpetrators of recent burg
laries in this city which gave the officers
bo much concern, beoause of the ability of
the guilty p rsons to cover up tneir tracks
so successfully that no clew to their iden
tity rould bo found.
When Slocum and Howard were ar
rested Deputy Sheriffs Peck and Tiromins
began to suspect that they were cuilty of
other burglaries. Upon investigation the
officers became convinced of the fact.
They then went to Howard, and after
questioning him and telling aim what
evidence they ha i already obtained he
confessed that be an Slocum had looted
Dr. Bassin's drugstore, M. J. Aeuirre's
grocery at the corner of I and Ventura
streets, a meatshop on Blacfcstone avenue
and the Buckeye store.
It is probable that no charges will be
preferred against the two prisoners for
these burglaries. Slocum has already
been sentenced to prison for ten years, and
it is expected that Howard will also re
ceive a severe sentence on Monday.
The officers can learn nothing of the for
mer history of the two burglars. They ar
rived in the city a few weeks ago, but it
cannot be ascertained where they came
from.

Mr. Lyons is known as the London Tailor, and his styles

Nelson, who conferred with Chief of Po
lice DeiÂ£sch and Detectives Grim and Afc-
Dermott as to the testimony to be offered.
I could face my God nnd say that that
testimony was perjured. It showed upon
its face that it was, and no oetter instance
can be found than in the positive contra
dictions by unprejudiced persons of the
statements of r>oiice officers concerning
George H, Jackson's alleged identification
of me.
"The State's case was a manu'actured
one, without any real foundation what- .
ever. Any man cf intelligence who fol
lowed the ca*e knows taat I was not given
a fair trial. Facts which should have
been a part of the evidence were sup
pressed because they did not agree with
the perjured statements of policemen. I
am willing that this shall be published
over my signature. I may have to die.
but I do not have to fear to speak my mind
honestly. Respectfully,

There was more than the usual activity
at Cuban League headquarters yesterday,
o'ving to the impetus given the movement
on Friday night by tbe vigorous soeecbes
at the committee meeting at California
BalL
"There were many callers at the head
quarters to-aay," said Secretary Mascbe
rini, "and the mails brought as a flood of
symoatheiic letters. The movement is
like a rolling snowball, for it gain
strength at eacn revolution. People who
were timid at the outset now speak out
freely, an ! there is no doubt in our minds
that the vast masses of the people are
with Cuba neart and soul."
The 'ollowinp letter is a sample of the
general feeling throughout the country:

years engaged in mining, and if in my bum-
Die way i can help orave Cuba I am only too
willing to do so. Kesp.-c.tfu;:> yours.

Like many other letters the foregoing b
based on the misapprehension that the
league here is seeking to raise a troop ot
belligerents. The following letter from
Sacramento is more nearly in the spirit of
the movement:

There were few changes of importance
in the situation at the armory yesterday,
although the otitsite applu talons lor re
lief are continually increasing and tbe
resources of the organization are taxed to
the utmost in ortter to keep pace with
them. Five minutes devoted to the in
spection of the work of the family relief
committee is calculated to satisfy any ob
server that the i revailing distress has not
been exaggerated. Tiie utmost care is
taken to guard a?ainÂ«t imposition, and
every applicant is subjected to a searching
cross-examination. If an applicant's re
plies are suiislactory to tbe committee be
is given an order for the required supplies
in the shape of food or clotning, and the
committee callÂ« the next case.
The majority of the applications are for
clothing, and all contributions of this
kind for men and women, children and
adults, will be gratefully accepted. This
portion of the stock on hand, it may be
said, is almost depleted.
In addition to the sixty-three families
previous y rec< rded, tickets were issued
yes erday for the relief of forty others.
The commissariat department allows
tbe loilowing to a family of five as a
week's supply:
Nine ponnds of potatoes. 2'^ pounds of on

12 pounds oi flour, *), of a pound nt coffee, 8
loaves of bread, 1 ,', u und of tea. S 1 ; pound* of
beans, 2 pounds of bxcon, 3 pounds ot dried
fruit, 2 bars oi soar, 1 box of breakfast oat
meal, 1 box of crackers.
The quantity supplied varies of course
as ttie number of a family rises above or
falls below that average.
Many applications are for medical as
sistance. One woman was sent to :he
polyclinic at 644 Mission street yester lay
and half a dozen mÂ«>n to Dr. Bonen's
offices. The Health Officer was notified of
a serious case at 607 Pine street, and on
Friday night another man was removed
to the Receiving Hospital.
The commissariat wagon made its usual
round and returned laden with the fol
lowing:
Two sacks of potatoes, box of macaroni, sack
of prunes, sack of dried apples, sact of corn
nieal, 2 sacks of flour. 8 sides of bacon, 2
hams, 5 cans of oysters, 3 cans of salmon, sack
of beans, 10 pounds of ciff--*, 4 nhaMci. 3

It was estimated that the supply on

Steady work was lound for four men
yesterday and 44 others earned 25 cents

Henry Cornahrens and his wife, who re
side at 620 Sterner street, were the recip
ients laat evening of an unwelcome dona
tion, albeit the gift was such as in any
well-regulated household where it be
longed would bs priceless. The gift in
question was nothing less than a beautiful
year-old baby, which Mr. and Mrs. Cor
nahrens found on their doorstep upon
their return to their residence at 11 o'clock
last night
The iciild was well dressed but was not
sufficiently protected from the cold and
must have suffered if it was long upon the
steps before its discovery. A handker
chief was tied around the child's lees to
prevent it from crawling away, but there
was no note or any possible clew to the
identi y of the child's unnatural parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Cornabrens had no use for

COLLEGIANS BEAT
NEVADA INDIANS
Stanford's Baseball Nine
Outclasses the Piute
Team.
A Giant Young Pitch?r oi
Promise Among New Palo
Alto Players.
Ten to Two the Score and Red M n
Aid d by a Prcfesnonal
Battery.
Stanford University defeated the Piute
Indians of Nevada at baseball yesterday
afiernoon on the Central Park grounds.
The score was 10 to 2.
It was practically the openiag game of
the season for the univeisity team, a test
of the ability of the material that after
over a month's more careful training
under Co <eh "Bill" Lance will meet the
University of California nine in the annual
championship series of three matches. To
the Indians, however, it was an old story,
for they- have been playing together as a
team for several months ana have been
in many games while traveling under the
management of wbiie men.
After this explanation of the status of
the two teams it is not unfair to say that
the Piutes play a game of ball that might
be creditable to a lot of Chinamen.
As base runners and fielders they are,
generally speaking, awkward and unskill
ful, and scarcely approximate the ease
and swiftness often attributed to young
men of their race. Had it not been for
the material assistance of two wi.ite men,
a professional catcher and a professional
pitcher, whom the Stan'ord manager pro
tested to protect the amateur standing of
the collegians, the Indian team might not
have ruude so gocd a showing compara
tively as the score indicates.
Sixteen errors by the Indians and five
by the collegians tell the story. Only
one Indian made no errors. One Stan
ford man. Sharp, the third b<:s-mÂ»n,
made four of the tive credited to his team.
His playing both in the field and at the
bat indicated that, although he was on
the Varsity last year, he is the weak man
of the team at present.
The wort of Beckett, the freshman
pitcher, was commendable. He struck
out ten men, gave only two bases on balls,
and aliowed but four hits off his delivery,
two of the hits being secured by the white
professional players, one of whom is from
the Philadelphia team and is coaching the
Piutes and lending his services behind the
bat whenever there is an opportunity,
very evidently contrary to pure amateur
principle?. In Beckett Stanford probably
baa found a man to take the place of
"Billy " McLain, the veteran Varsity
pitcher, who, having served four years, is
no longer eligible to the team according to
the existing intercollegiate agreement.
In the sixth inning Beckett fanned the
side out in one- two-three order. Captain
Thompson and young Clemans are also
among the possibilities for the pitcher's
position, which has been considered the
only hard place to fill in this year's Stan
ford team.
Beckett, the pitcher; Young, the first
baseman, and Freeman, the center-fielder,
are a noticeable -trio of giant young
athletes among the Stanford players.
| E ten is over 6 feet 2 inches in height and
weighs close to 200 pounds. All are foot
ball players. Beckett was guard on the
freshman team that de.eaied the Berke
ley freshmen. Yonng sings bass in the
Gee Club. Freeman is one of the Stan
ford, the intercollegiate and Southern
California team-.' champions in doubles.
Among the new men are Ciaire Strohn,
who playe<l tirst base for the coast cham
pion Tufts-Lyons team, and Loughead,
who was shortstop for that team. Both
are Los Angeles boys.
In Thompson, Wight and Strohn Stan
ford appear-, to hure three reliable batters.
Young is the heaviest hitter ot the team,
but like many home-run men his long
I Hies often fall into the hands of distant
tieldrn.
Jeft* is an unusually lively man behind
I the bat and is sure on all sorts of fouls.
i lie wa- quick as an end rush on the Var
â  sky football team and be is quick as a
baseman.
As a team the Stanford players of this
sea-nn eive promise of better per'orrn

A DOCTOR^
WHO VISITS
EVERY HOME.
You will naturally wonder how a physician can visit every
household throughout the country. He does it in this way :
This little article goes into every home, and through it Doctor
Cook speaks to every family. He speaks to you. He asks you,
in sacred confidence, the following questions, which you will do
well to answer in person or by letter :
MEN.
Are you weak ?
Is your sleep refreshing?
Do you have emissions?
Have you day losses?
Do you have pimples?
Do you shan society?
Are you lacking in self-confidence?
Do you have dizziness?
Are your thoughts gloomy?
Is your memory poor?
Have you weak back?
Do your kidneys pain ?
Have yon exhausted your vitality?
Are you sexually weak?
Do you contemplate marriage?
Are you nt for matrimony ? I
As these symptoms become more prominent the power of
manhood and the beauty of womanhood disappear. Try and get
back what you have lost. Explain your condition to Doctor
Cook, who is recognized everywhere as the greatest living
specialist on all sexual diseases of both men and women.

Fitzsimmons, Armed With a Shotgun,
Sallies Forth in Quest of
Jackrabbits.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 27. â JacKrabbit
huntiDg has been adopted by Bob Fitz
simmons as a new and snecial feature of
his training routine. Bob never boasted
that he was a phenomenon with a shot
gun, but somebody told him that in Ne
vada all one had to do was to shut his
eyes and blaze away, then go out and
. gather the slain memhersof the long-eared
fraternity frequenting the sagebrush.
Nothing would do him to-day but to eallv
fortii for slaughter. Dan Hickey and
Btelzner, the Cornishman's sparring part
ners, were ordered out to shoulder shot
guns which Bob had borrowed in the
â  neighborhood, while Ernest Roeber, the
wrestler, brought up the rear with a ciub
and Fitzsimmons' Qreat Dane, Yarum.
''This affair is to be exclusive, mind you,"
was the caution that Bob left with those
who remained behind, and then the party
- sailied forth.
Fitzsimmons led his trainers all orer the
surrounding foothills for three hours, and
then they began to show signs of ex
haustion. First Hickey begged to be al
lowed to go home, and then Roeber re
membered that he had some letters to
write. Stelzuer was game, and was tell
ing Fitz how he intended to stick it out
when Yar;m gave a yelp and lay down.
The big pugilist had no sympathy for the
trainers, but when the Dane collapsed he
agreed to turn back.
At the training quarters there were
visions of rabbit pie and all sorts of good
things, but these were displaced by ex
pressions of trief and disappointment
when the huntsmen hove into view
empty handed.
"No catch 'em even squirrel?" asked
Bam, the Chinese cook.
"Nope." laconically replied Fitzsim
mons. "I guess they saw us coming. But
never mind; we will try it again to-mor
row, and we won't come back until we
have knocked a wagon-load of them."
. At this a concerted roar went up from
Hickey, Stelzner and Roeber. If there
was to be any more rabbit hunting, they
declared, they would resign their jobs. So
Fitzsimmons will have to go out alone
after this.
The Cornish man's work to-day com
prised a run over the hills and the rabbit
hunt daring the morning and nine rounds
of furions boxing with his three trainers
in the afternoon. During the latter direr
sion Fitzsimmons accidently used his
eibow on Rickey's forehead and cut quite
a gash just over the right eye. Hickey
was not at all pleased with thia treatment
and said something about looking about
for a more congenial occupation.
Good-natured Fitzsimmona squared
matters in little while, however, by chal
lenging Hickey to a game of crusoe and
beating him out of $30. And just to show
that he was still strong and looking for
work, Fitzsimmons took off his coat and
pitched into a pile of wood with an ax.
He made the splinters fly for at least
twenty minutes and turned out a healthy
heap of kindling, much to the gratifica
tion of the cook.
Jim Corbett has been compelled to ease
up in his training. It is the result of a
command issued this morning by Billy
Delaney, the Californian'a chief trainer.
Delaney has been making a careful study
of James J.s condition since his arrival
here and he has reached the conclusion
that the big fellow has had more work
than is good for him. He fears that if
Corbett is allowed to have his own way he
will pass the limit of perfection of condi
tion and grow Kale. In consequence the
afternoon boxing, wrestling and bag
punching will be cut out of Corbeit's
training programme. Instead of these
Delaney will now take him out for a
tramp over the hills surrounding Shaw's
Springs.
"What I want to do is to keep him full
of fresh air and deprive him of a portion
of his indoor work," was the way Billy
explained it to me to-day. "I don't want
to be understood as intimating that Jim
is going back or that he is in immediate
danger of doing himself harm, but I con
sider that he is in the best possible con
dition he can ever hope to reach right
now, and I say 'Let well enough alone.'
Jim was never so fit before in his life, and
while it may be that he could be made
better, still I do not believe in taking any
chances. I only wish the fight was to
morrow. He is ready to tight for his life
and anybody's money. I thinic that by
taking off a good deal of his work
I can keep him where he is now, and that
means that he will win to a certainty."
Corbett himself does not take altogether
kindly to the idea of cutting down his
work. He is a glutton for exertion while
in training, and this is not the rirst time
that Delaney has had to put down his foot
solidly and arbitrarily decree what "Pom
CORBETT RECEIVING VISITORS AT SHAW'S SPRINGS.
padour Jim" shall do and what he shall
not.
The big fellow's bout with Jeffries to
day was one of the rarest treat* tbose who
regularly visit the training quarters have
yet enjoyed. Both men were full of gin
ger and went at each other as though the
championship of the world depended upon
the result.
Jeffries has entirely recovered from the
nervousness that affected him when he
first donned the mitts with Corbett, and
goes into his employer now with the
determination to land if he can and land
bard at that. James J. has all tie can do
to keep out of range of the Los Angeles
phenomenon's flying, chubby fists, and he
confesses that these bouts are doing him
more good than all the rest of his work.
Daring their Bet-to to-day Corbett pur
posely allowed Jeffries to work him into
one of tbe corners of the handball court in
order that be might brighten himself np
a little in the art of escaping from tight
and dangerous places. Jeffries misunder
stood the big chap'a purpose and stepped
back to let him out.
"Here, what are you doing?" roared
Corbett. "Get right in here after me and
lash out the best you've got. Put it on
me if you can."
Jeffries did not wait for a secend invita
tion, but sailed in to do a good job. It
was more than Corbett bargained for. Jef
fries began to lay on hammer and tongs,
and so fiercely that the Californian could
not side step or dodge out of his predica
ment. He was finally compelled to clinch
with the Los Angeles giant in order to
escape.
"That's great," said Corbett when he
reached the center of the court. "1 tell
you, young fellow, you are the making of
a good one. Tbat was the best rally I
have had in a year. If you will give me a
coupleoftho.se everyday I will soon eet
so I can dodge out of the way of a flying
cannon ball."
Corbett might have been pleased with
the clever manner in which ha evaded
Jeffries' furious rush, but there was one
onlooker who was not. That person was
William A. Brady, Corbett's theatrical
partner and backer. Brady do^s not
mean to let the impression go out that he
has lost any confidence in Corbett, but he
was candid enouzh to admit 10-ciay that
there were some features of the champion's
work he does not exactly fancy.
"I miiriu just as well be plain about tbis
matter," said Brady, in explanation. â¢â¢!
â¢ believe tbat Jim is a 100 percent better

man now than he has been in three years,
and I am satisfied that bis wind and stay
ing powers are perfect. But I am not
pleased with his foot work. He does not
seem to me to be as quick on his pins as he
used to be. It may be that Jeffries'
methods compelled Jim to hold to one
spot a good deal, but it strikes me that
be should be a little more shifty. It would
never do for him to allow Fitzsimmons to
get him in a corner as Jeffries did."
Now, Billy Brady has bet a good deal of
money already on Corbett and expects to
put up a good deal more. He is as wise a
young man as can be found on the conti
nent. It is just possible that Billy would
like to have a story go out to the effect
that he is not sure of his protege's chances,
in the hope that it would cause a change
in the belting and afford him an opportu
nity to get d beard at something like even
money.
George Green, who is to do battle with
"Mysterious" Billy Smith the day before
the Corbett-Fitzsimmons contest, and Dal
Hawkins, who is to meet Martin Flaherty
on the same day, went into active train
ing to-day at Empire. Both of the San
Franciscans are confident that they will
take the world's championships of their
respective classes home with them.
In the Nevada Assembly to-day a bill
was called up by Representative Allen of
Eureka, which, had it passed, would
have seriously handicapped the Pullman
Company''i excursions to the big fight.
The bill provided that each sleeper and
buffet passing through Nevada should be
taxed for a hotel-Keepers' license and a
liquor-dealers' license as well. Not only
this, but the tax was to holu good in
every county through which the cars
passed. This would mean that they
wouid be assessed in seven counties be
fore reaching Carson, and as seven cars
usually comprise a train it can readily be
seen that a veritable harvest would be
taken in.
The bill didn't pass. The Carson rep
resentatives got up and fought it tooth
and nail. They realized that if the bill
became a law it would keep thousands
out of Carson, and they succeeded in
beating it.
Dan Stuart's physicians have advised
him that he must have a cnange of' cli
mate before he can expect to completely
recover from his recent attack of pneu
monia. If he is strong enough he will be
taken to San Francisco to-morrow night,
and will remain there at least a week be
fore returning to Carson.

rift Shott in the World Will Compete In
the Carton Match**.
CARSON, Nkv., Feb. 27.â One hundred
dozens of live pigeons were ordered to-day
for the live-bird ehoot to be conducted by
Dan A. Stuart in conjunction with the
triple tistic events of next month. One
half of these will be shipped from Chicago
by Malachi Hogan, Stuart's representative
there, and the other half will be brought
by Ed Fay, Stuart's agent in San Fran

It looks now as though the shoot was
going to be a mammoth affair. Aside
from the live birds individual champion
ship, there will be interstate trapshooting
matches. Montana, Utah, Idaho, Wyo
ming and California are getting teams into
shape and will come on to take part in the
competitions. The ten-bird handicap
sweepstakes, $5 entrance fee and liberal
percentage of gate receipts, say half, will
be another feature of the tournament.
The championship trophy, held by
Elliott, was shipped from New York
yesterday and will reach this city
on Tuesday. Aside from defending his
title and his trophy, Elliott will probably
head a State team to enter the interstate
match.

Santa Rosa's Meeting the
Best Ever Held on
the Coast.
Loughead, Z egler and McFar
land Win the Profes
sional Events
Mott of Oak'and and Wing of San
Jose Capture the Prizes
for Amateurs.
SANTA ROSA, Cxt,., Feb. 27. â The
greatest day's cycle racing ever seen in
California was that promoted by the Santa
Rosa Wheelmen at their three-lap track
here to-day, the occasion being the open
ing of the State circuit. There was a big
card of events and the nigh class of the
competitors insured rare sport for the
thousands who attended. There were
champions from everywhere and the par
ticular ones whose stars Bhone most bril
liantly after it was all over were: Fred
J. Louehead of Canada, who captured the
mile open; Otto Zaicler Jr. of San Jose,
who won the third-mile scratch; Floyd A.
McFarland, also of San Jose, who won the
five-mile event, defeating the mighty
Becker of National fame, and Mott cf Oak
land and Wing of San Jose, who captured
the amateur events.
Loughead stamped himself a veritable
champion by his wonderful ride in the
mile event, and Zieeler away back in the
ruck on the last tarn in tha third mile
forged past his field like a whirlwind and
won in splendid style. It was a day of
surprises in some lespeets, but the best
man won every time and the spectators
were well satisfied.
The track was not as fast as it was ex
pected to be, but was in fair shape, and
the meeting was well handled by the local
club, which has had experience in this
line before, having conducted several suc
cessful meets last year.
The crack event of the day waÂ« the five
mile open, professional, the line-up at the
tape Oeing Harry Terrill, McFarland,
Becker, Stevens, "Bob" Terrill, Freeman
and Byrne. It was run in one heat,
paced. The first pacing machine put In
was a quadruplet, manned by Morris,
Davis, Whitman and Bovee. After one
false start they got going, the line behind
the "quad" being Freeman, H. Terrill,
McFarland and the others cloee up.
Becker almost immediately rode ahead
and backed down on the inside of the
"quad" and got the pole. McFarland got
second place. Then Harry Terrill went
up and caught the pacemaker, but was
forced out and gave way to McFarland.
The time for the first mile was 2:26 1-5.
On the second mile there was another
fight for the pacer and McFarJand got it
for a moment, but was forced out by
Becker. H. Terrill, Byrne and Freeman
closely followed and "Bob" Terrill
dropped out. The time for the two miles
was 5:05.
There was more trouble for the pace
makers on the third lap, the men contin
ually running ahead and backing in.
Becker swerved and Freeman and Byrne
fell. Ziejrler was put in on a single to
pace and the quad dropped out. The
three miles was ridden in 7:50.
On the fourth lap Jones, Loughead and
Dick Aylward on a triplet swung in to pace,
and so did Wells on a single. The line
was Stevens, McFarJand and Becker,
Harry Terrili having dropped out. The
time for the four miles was 10:20.
Becker led at the beginning of the last
mile. The triplet dropped out and Wells
continued the pacing on a tingle until the
last lap, when he left them to fight it out
amone themselves. McFarland and Stev
ens just played with Becker. They let
him lead until the last turn and then
went by him as they pleased, McFarland
winning in 12:36 2-5, with Stevens second
and Becker third.
It was the best race ever Men in the
State, every one who knew said, and the
great five-mile run between Bald, Cooper
and Murphy at San Jose in 1895 mna the
rides of Becker on New Year's day and on
Washington's birthday this year pale
in comparison.
The audience was on its feet from
beginning to end, yelling for Us favorites,
and the excitement was intense. Never
has a race aroused so much enthusiasm,
and while the defeat of Becker was a sur
prise it is generally believed that he
would have won had he not wasted so
much energy fighting for the pacing ma
chines and been satisfied with second or
third place behind them.
The day's sport opened with a profes
sional race at one-third of a mile, run in
three heats ana a tinal, first and second
and fastest third to qualify. In the first
heat Loughtad of Canada won easily from
Wells, Morris, Wliitman and Byrne in
:49 1-5. the finish being In that order.
Tne second heat was prettily contested
between Ztegler, Stevens, Becker. Coulter,
Freeman and Harry Terrill. Ziegler was
crowded at the start and fell back from
first place to last He came with a rush
at the finish and got third. Coulter looked
a winner turning into the straight, but
finished fourth. Becker won hy inches.
TimÂ«, :47 1-5.
Allan Jones took the third heat as hÂ«
pleased. McFariand was entered, but did
not start. Bovee of Texas got second,
Davis third. Time, :50 2-5.
The final was a beautiful ride with snch
cracks as Loughead, Becker, Stevens,
Ziegler, Wells, Bovee and Jones starting.
*Rom the jump a fight for position ensued
between Zieeler, Becker, Jones and Lous
head. Bovee came up from the back and
passed the bunch, Ziegler, Jones and
Lougbead tacking on. Becker caught up
with them on the last turn, but Wells and
Stevens were left. It was a hoi battle
down the straight, resulting in a victory
for Zlecler by a narrow margin over Jones
and Loughead. Becker was a good fourth.
The time *â¢â  :44 4-5.
This was Ziegler'a first appearance in
competition in California in three years,
and he signalized it and his commence
ment of bis racing career for 1897 by a
clean victory, tor winch he received a lib
eral amount of applause.
The mile open ; professional, proved
one of the best races of the day. The first
heat was very slow, owing to a misunder
standing as to who should pace. Wells
jumped out on the back turn, and was
never headed. Morris of Texas got sec
ond, and Davis of San Jose third. The
time was 3:04.
The second heat was both fast and
funny. Jones, Loughead, "Bob" Terrili,
Whitman and Bovee started. Some one
bumped into Bovee on the last turn, and
he was forced off tne track and fell into a
mud-puddle. He was unhurt, but his new
blue racing suit was a sight to behold
when he arose. Jones showed great speed,
and won Irom Loughead and Terrill in a
close finish. The time was 2:27 2-5.
The starters in the third heat were
McFarland, Becker, Stevens. Harry Ter
rill and Freeman. McFarland led the en
tire last lap, winning in 2:40 1-5. The team
work of McFarland and Stevens in this
Heat was very pretty and assisted ma
terially in giving them the victory.
This Drought Wells, Morris, Jones,
Longhead, "Bob" Terrill, McFarland and
Stevens into final. The final was paced
by a triplet, manned Dy Davis, Bovee and
Harry Terrill. The triplet took a flying
start and there was a pretty fight for posi
tions behind it. Jones got the favored
place, with the others strung out behind.
"Bob" Terrill would not have it that way
and rode ahead of the triplet, dropping
back on the inside. Jones was forced back
to tbird piace, Loughead being second,
McFarland fourth, Stevens, Morris and
Wells following in the order named. Mc-
Farland moved up to the front on the iast
lap, closely followed by all but Wells and
Morris, who were lef;. When they turned
into the stretch Loughead forged ahead
and it was all over, for he gained at every
stride and landed a winner by a clean six
lengths in one of the finest races ever seen
in California. McFarland took second,
Jones third and Terrill fourth, ell bunched
together. The time was 2:18 15, remark
ably tast for the track.
Loughead has not been well for the past
week and hi? performance was therefore
all the more creditable. He is every inch
a champion and is withal the most popular
Eastern racing man who has yet visited
this State, his politeness and modest;
gaining him scores of friends among the
spectators and racing men.
There were two amateur events on the

vital force, nerve, energy and muscular power, and have failed to attain strength and
perfect manhood; .
Middle-Aged Men,
Who for want of strength and vigor, whether induced by indiscretion excesses, care
overwork, mental anxiety, exposure or otherwise, find their physical powers prema-
turely declining; v
Old Men, i
Who think their waning vitality the natural result of the progress of old ace and
decay, when it is simply the want of animal electricity and the power of the body to
reproduce it unaided ; will find in , .

HIS OLD SPEED
And Beats Buckwa a Head
in Exceedingly Fast
Time.
The Schrieber Stake Captured
by Estro, a Sen of
Flambeau
Mamie Scott Took a Mile Run at
Oids of ioo to iâ V men the
Only Winning Choic?.
The sport at Ingleside track was much
enjoyed by the big crowd in attendance
v'esterday even though it was a trifle jerky
arid iridescent to sporty. It was another
banner day for outsiders and the plungers
arid form players unloaded enough of
their coin tc purchase several racetracks.
When "Mamie Scott won the third event
. of the day at any old price, varying from
60 to 100 to 1, the field-book men were
troubled with a feeling ol ennui th.it had
â¢ s-carce worn off when Bstro and Lincoln
succeeded in gathering in the two follow
ing raoes at ju;cy price?, thus relieving
them of more surplus casu. There was a
iiungry crowd of uettors in t c bisÂ» ring
and as they became disentangled from
their money like a hoosier at a country
lair, the bookmakers' bank rolls must
have- fattened quite extensively. Of all
the seven favorites sent to the post Ye
men the aged sprinter alone justified the
confidence reposed in him.
Seldom have four laster sprinters met
on any track than the quartet that triea
conclusions in the last race of the day, a
six-furlong spin, and the bis crowd
â¢ patiently abided tbe time for them to re
spond to the bugle call. Libertine 107,
Buctwa 104, Magnet 107 and David IW%
was the collection of speed assembled.
Dan Honig's pet Magnet was tirst chalked
up a 6 to 5 choice in tbe rinsr, but the
wipe ones figured that he was not up to a
bruising race, and Buckwa carried the
bulk of the big money bet, cutting his
odds from 8 to 3 to (i to 5, while Magnet's
â¢ odds resided to 8 to 5. Six to one wa>
obtainable against Galen Brown's big bay
and 12 against plain-looking David.
â¢ Buckwa w.as. rirst away from the barrier,
with Magnet trailing about two lengths
behind. Tod btoan had a gentle wrap on
the leader swinging into the stretch and
evidently fancied himself astride the soft
est thing of the day. Straightened away
for the wire Slaughter, on Magnet, shook
. the chestnut up. and coming on with that
electrifying burst of speed he wore down
BucKwa's lead foot by foot and led him
past the judges' stand a good head in
. 1:13%, within a quarter of a second of the
trace record, held by Crescendo. Eight
lengths away David was given third place
. over Libertine, though it looked ai though
the latter secured that position by a head.
â¢Ttie.Schreiber stake for two-year-olds at
four furlongs, worth $1300. was another
Btrong feature of the card. The Spreckel?
stable's Imperious and Maxlone were
scratched, leaving eight to go to the post.
â¢ Louis Ezell's colt The Cheat, with Mo
liu^h up hud tirst call in the betting at
.â¢ odds of 7to 5. A hot tip was prevalent on
Thorpe, but he was lame and made no
bh owing whatever. The race was pro
ductive of another surprise, for Eitro, a
Son of Flambeau and Bailie G, carrying
the colors of J. Kaglee Burke, headed
. Roxey Murphy in the stretch and aefeated
â¢ the tirst choice with comparative ease in
â¢ bQ\i seconds. Duke of York II with 40 to 1
..about him was an indifferent third.
Eieven silling platers went to the post

Winner, V. A. Honlg's eh. h., by imp.
in the opening mile selling dash, with Tar
and Tartar ruling a consistent 2 to 1
favorite. The winner turned up in Olive,
which receded from 5 to 2 to fours, and
heading her field a furlong lrom the wire,
won with considerable to spare from
Japonica, the Corrigan entry. The favorite
was a close third.
In the next, a six-furlong selling sprint,
the money went in on Yemen as though it
were all over, forcing his odds from 8 to 5
down to 11 to 10. The contending horse,
Midlo, was left at the post, and the favorite
romped home an easy winner from Be na
mely. Pat Murphy was a close third.
The biggest surprise of the day was the
win of the third event, a mile run, by
Mamie Scott, a 100 to 1 outsider in the
betting on the twelve starters. Stentor
was a 9 to 10 favorite, with Tod Sloan up.
When the barrier was raised Piggott
rushed Mamie Scott away in advance of
the bunch, and, maintaining her lead
throughout, won ridden out a length be
fore the fovorite in 1:43%. McLight made
a good run, being beaten but a head for
the place. The first choice was away
poorly or he would have won.
The start for the mile handicap was an
unfortunate one, both Argentina and
Moylan being left at the post. They were
second and fourth choices in the betting,
respectively. Installator, in at 109 pounds,
with Sam Doggett up, was a consistent 9
to 5 choice.
The lone shot players backed Flashlight,
carrying 98 pound, and they got a great
run for their money. The outsider led
the party until past the paddock, where
tbe fast clip began to tell and be was
nabbed and beaten out half a length by
Lincoln 11, ridden by "Pebble" Thomp
son. Installator was a poor third. The
winner was backed down in the betting
from 10 to 8 to 1.
A deliriously relishable specimen of the
"lobster" species was served to the Ingle
side association's guests in the mile and a
half iiurdle handicap, in tbe crack jumper
Baby Bill. The "leppsr," ridden by J.
Owens and delegated to carry 145 Dounds
and pitted azainst a very ordinary lot,
was naturally installed an 8 to 5 favorite.
His showing in the race was about the
worst ever made on one of the local tracks,
being taken back to the rear of the bunch,
where he stayed and finished. Arnndel,
played down to the primer's name by the
wise clique, won the affair easily from
Governor Jtfudd, a 10 to 1 chance, with old
Dungarven finishing in the show.
NOTES.
J. Owens, rider of Baby Bill, and the
horse and his owners, King Bros., were
suspended immediately after the hurdle
Â»ace for the disgraceful showing made by
the jumper. The horse was undoubtedly
a "dead one," as well as one or two others
in the race, and a severe ruling may serve
to make this branch of the game a trifle
more clean, for a time at least.

following dates for the rnnning of the re
mainder of its valuable stakes:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1897.
SAYS HIS WIFE
STABBED HIM
John P. Hagan Has Made
His Ante- Mortem
Statement.
Mrs. Hagan Is Detained in the
City Prision Pending De
velopments.
Shs Claims He Threatened to Kill
Her With a Hatchet and She
Defended Herself.
John P. Hagan is hovering between life
and death in the Receiving Hospital and
his young wife Mary is in the City Prison,
and should her husband die, she will be
charged with murder.
The police were notified yesterday morn
ing that Hagan's death was only a question
of hours, and Corporal Leinden was sent
to take his ante- mortem statement.
Friday night Hagan made contradictory
statements. At first he said he was play
ing on the sofa with his baby girl in his
residence, 33 South Park, with a carving
knife in his hand when he slipped from
the sofa and fell upon the knife. Later he
said he was chopping wood, and his wife
had the carving-knife in her band. In a
playful struggle for possession of the knife
be was cut.
In his ante-mortem statement he
deliberately charges his wife with cutting
him with the knife, and declares that it is
the truth. Tbe statement is as follows:
Believing that 1 am about to die, I, John P.
Hagan of 33 South Park, make tins, my dying
statement:
About 7 o'clock last night, after supper, I
came home. My wife was under the influence
of liquor. 1 accused her of it and she began
to throw things at me. I explained to ncr
that sue would be nothing but a common
woman if she kept on associating with the
people that Rhe was associating with. She
claimed that my mother put me up to say
those tilings about her. She went to a drawer,
took out a carving-knife and said, " you, I
will cut your heart out." I had my two hands
in my pockets when she cut me. as I did not
think she would do it. I then ran out into
the street. This is true.
After making the statement his wife
was ushered into his presence, and in
answer to the question as to whether she
had uÂ«ed the knife upon him he replied
"Yes."
Mrs. Hagan, who is only 21 years of age,
claims that she was forced >o seize tue
knife to defend herself from her husband,
who was threatening to kill her with a
hatchet.
"He came home last night in an ugly
mood. After supper he Jay down on the
lounge and after ne had slept for an hour
or so something the baby did awoke him.
rie abused me fi r not taking care of the
baby and began to throw things at me. I
expostulated with him, bin it made him
worse and he called me a bad name.
"He got hold of me and threw me on
the floor. He picked up the hatchet and
said he bad a good mind to kil! me. 1
was afraid be would, as he i.ad often
threatened to kill me, and I struggled
with him and got to my feet.
"He was coming at me again, and I had
the carving-Knife in my hand. 1 pushed
him away from me with the knife and be
went out. The way I pushed him with
the knife could not have cut him, and I
believe he stabbed himself, as he was al
ways talking about not caring to live. He
did not get on^well where he was working
and that seemed to make him despondent.
He only got $55 a month and he thought
he should have more.
"The people 1 associated with are good
peonle, just as Â£ood as be or his people
are, and he had no right to talk that way
about them. He was always jealous, anil
one day wnen I -was talking to a man
from Alarneda he grabbed him by the
throat, and I thought he would have
killed him. I knew his folks never liked
me. and after 1 was about a year married,
just after my baby was born, I had to
leave him and go to my father's house. I
was away from nim about a year and then
went back to him.
"I don't deny that I take a glass of beer
MRS. MARY HAGAN and Her Husband, Whom She Attempted
to Kill, and the Weapons She Used.
occasionally, but I was never the worse of
it in my life, except once, and that was
nearly three years ago, when I was not
living with him."
Mr.Â«, Hagan does not seem to be at all
sorry for her husbana's condition. From
what she said they have lived unhappily
since they were married. She was only l(i
years of age when she first met him, and
they were married within a year. Her
father, Louis Homeier, is leader of the or
chestra in Macdonough's Theater, Oak
land. He lives at 1527 Willow street, Ala
meda, and yesterday morning Mrs. Ha
gan's little girl was taken to his home.

Market street. He represented himself to
be a policeman and said he was in need of
ready cash and wanted to sell bis warrant
for February. The $100 was handed to
him, Jess the usual commission, and he
signed the reeu'ar order in :he name of
Luther M. Say, who wears star 550.
A few days later ne again visited
Kampe's office and sold his warrant for
March, again signing Say's name ;o the
order.
Karape took both orders to City Auditor
Broderick with the. rro'iest to have the
warrants withheld so v a tie could obtain
payment of the amounts from the Treas
urer.
The police warrants were handed oat
yesterday and Siy got his and took it to
the Auditor. Bay was astounded when
lha Auditor told him be had an order
from Kamne for his warrants for February
and March.
"There must be some mistake," said
Say, "as I never got a cent from a money
broker in my life. Somebody has been
personating me and forging my name."
The Auditor suggested that he should
lay tbe lacts before Chief Crowley and Say
hurried to the Chief's office. The Chief
was absent and Say told his story to Fer
geant Mollitt, who is at present acting as
the Chief's clerk in the absence of Clerk
Healy. Sergeant Moffltt went with Say
to the Auditor and payment of the Febru
ary warrant was stopped pending develop
ments.
Kampe was notified by telephone and he
was very much disgusted to find that ne
bad been duped. He at once admitted
that Say was not tbe man and furnished
tli c police with a description of him.
It is thought that tbe forcer is familiar
with the police and had on tome occasions
obtained warrants himself. The police
are working on this supposition.
LOWELL SCHOOL
IS CHAMPION
It Is Triumphant at the
First Academic League
Meet.
Scores 23 Points out of 36, With
Central High School
Second.
Stirring Incidents of the Dayâ Bntries,
Time, and Winners of the
Various Events.
The first bicycle meet of the Academic
Athletic League was held yesterday after
noon at the Velodrome. Although the
spectators were mostly limited to the
pupils of the schools and a few ladies, the
boys put up races deserving of greater at
tention from lovers of the. sport.
The meet was for the championship of
the league, with 5 points for the rim
place, 3 for second and 1 for third. The
result was a winning for the Lowell High
School, which scored 23 points, lo 10 for
the Central High School, 3 for the Ala
meda University Academy and 0 for tbe
California College Academy.
Tne entries for the first heat of the half
mile were: Rnss, L. H. S. ; Agnew, C. H.
8.; Bill, L. H. 8. For the second heat:
Woerner, L H. S. ; Kenna, C. H. S. ;
Bozlo, L. H. 8., and Goodfellow, A. U. A.
Rusa won the first in 1:23, with BUI
second. Kenna came out ahead in tbe
second in 1:28 3-5, with Woerner second.
In the linal Russ won In 1:03 1-5, with
Kenna pecond and Woerner third.
For the one mile the entries were Ful
ler, L. H. S., and Bozio, L. H. S., for the
first heat, and Cornell, L. H. S-, Agnew
and Blanchard, both C. H. S , for the s?c
ond. Fuller wou tbe first heat in 2:40.
The second was disqualified because none
of the racers came up to the time limit of
2:40. It was re-run, Blanchard winning
in 2:40 3-5, Cornell second.
By an error of the timekeepers tbe bell
was rung ob the next to tbe last lap.
Blanchard came in first, with Cornell sec
ond, but Blanchard dropped back, think
ing the race was over, and when the bell
rang a second time Cornell crossed the
line a winner, v ith Blanchard second.
It was on account of this error, thereby
decreasing the speed of tbe men, that the
time was allowed. When the final was
run Fuller led off, but Bie.nchard forged
ahead amid the great excitement of tbe
schoolboys. Fuller again went to the
head in a few more laps and stayed there,
despite tbe strenuous efforts of the piucky
Biancbard to pass him, winning in 2 :30 4-5.
Blanchard came second nnd Cornell third.
In the two-thirds of a mile event the
entries for the first heat were Fuller and
Cornell, L. H. S., and Boole, C. H. S. ; for
the second heat Goodfellow, A. U. A.,
Blanchard, C. H. S., and Bill, L. H. S.
The first was won by Fuller in 1:49 3-5,
Cornell second, and the second by Blanch
ard in 1:38, with Goodfellow second. The
final was taken by Fuller in 1:45, with
Goodfellow second and Blanchard third.
Cornell really came in second, but was dis
qualified for not obeying the injunction
that each man to win must at some time
during me race forge to the head.
There was only one heat in the fourth
or two-mile event The entries were Russ,
Boole. 0. H. S., Wosrner and K-nna.
The races were paced by a tandem, and
Boole dropped out on the' third lap. The
first mile was left behind in 2:19 3-5.
Then the men warmed up and began to
work. Kenna led to the last lap, but at
the sound of the gong Rass, riding like a
veritable demon", shot past him and the
stand a winner by a length. Kenna's
chain broke jast as ho passed the stand.
Time, 4:413 5.
Between the various heats the specta
tors were kept interested first by a half
mile tandem exhibition by Boole and
Kroetz. They covered the distance in
1:21 4-5. Then Honigsberg and Shearer
gave a tandem exhibition of a third of a
mile. They did the distance in :39 3-5.
R. A. Welch acted as referee; 0. Hahn,

ROPE PULLING IN
THE BIG PAVILION
An Excitable Crowd Wit
nessed the First Contest
of the Tournament.
The Canadian, Swedish, Scotch,
Irish and American Teams
Were the Victors.
On Monday Evening There Will Be
Close Struggles Among the
Winners.
The first international lug-of-war tour
nament of the season opened last night in
the Mechanics' Pavilion under "favorable
auspices, under the management of that
promoter of athletics, D. R. McNeill.
The Pavilion was comfortably Tilled with
the better class of San Francisco's lovers
of genuine sport, including quite a num
ber of well-dressed ladies, who took as
much apparent interest in the contests of
Btrengih and endurance as did their male
escorts.
His honor Judge Campbell, with a brand
new silk "tile" and the kinks in his
whiskers all straightened out, looked tbe
picture of a Judge. When not engaged in
supervising the contest he made himself
sociable with a knot of favored individuals
who were admitted into the inclosure
reserved- for members of the press by of
fering a small wager tbat the "pull" in
tne corridors outside of his courtroom
could outclass the best team in the tour
nament.
Railroad Commissioner Dr. Stanton was
willing to go him one better with tbe
louby in oacramento or that said to hang
round the National Capitol when the
funding bill was up for consideration.
'loose who attended the sport last night
.ivere loud in their praise of McNeiiFa in
dicator, by wnich tbe slightest loss or
gain of either ieam could be plainly seen
lrom the most remote section of the
building.
It was 9:30 o'clock when Judge James A.
Campbell raised his little silver pistol a
considerable distance from bis lovely
whiÃkers and pointing it in tbe direction
of the big bell attached to the rafters
pulled the trigger, and tbat was the signal
for the onemnjf of the great international
tug-of-war tournament.
The first teams to en<er upon the cleated
platform were ib- French and Cana
dians The batting â and at this mention
the Judge blushed â was in favor of the
Canadians, out the supporters of tbe
French team were not backward in their
coin, and as a result many dollars changed
hand-.
The Canucks soon prove d their supe
riority over their able opponents. The iirst
tug brought the dial or indicator six
inches in the direction of Canada. Then
the n> was a stop, but each time the cap
tain of the Canadian team his men a
aignal tbe indicator moved along slowly
but gradually to the Canadian side. The
contest lasted exactly 5 minutes 45 sec
onds, and was won by the Canadian team.
T.'ie Danish and Swedish teams were
next to put in an appearance. The
Swedes came first and selected the west
end of the platform. Immediately fol
lowing came the Danes, who were a power
ful Aggregation of men. The pools sold I
slightly in favor of tbe fcwede*, who in
. past tournaments proved themielves a
card body of men to defeat.
Judge Campbel a. am appeared at the
starting-post with his little Nixâhooter,
which contained only blank cartridges, as
hr* Honor positively refused to handle
any implement's that carried lead. He re
marked that although his whiskers looked
hoary lie was not ready to bag any game
outside of the jurisdiction of the court
over whicli ho prefides.
At 9:08 o'clock tbe Judge culled the
trigger of his silvered beauty and the tug
wa- in order. Neither team gained an
inch at the start, but ihedial made a jump
to bwedeu. Tne Danes bucicied down and
the indicator moved back to its original
position. After a long rest the Swedish
team made one grand effort and tbe indi
cator inufci' along the stick until it came
bang Hgainst the end. The Swedes won
tbe pull in 4 mm. 26 sec.
T:ie band j-layert a favorite Scottish air,
"Ihe Oamnbens Are Coniici-," and this
was the signal for tiie appearance of the
Highlnii'ifis, who marched like tro"pers
on board tiie platform. The Scotch ie*m
had us its opponents the Italians, who,
although small in stature compared with
their husky antagonists, looked quite an
aggressive body of r.>pe-pulie;s. There

The Peculiar Mission of

MISSIONARIES ALL LACK
TACT.
They â¢ Ignore Eastern Supersti
";. tions But Preach Their Own
;' r â  With Fervor.
: WOTJiLD RECONCILE THEM TO
â¢ " BUDDHISM.
Something- 'About the Horrors of
' â¢â¢â¢ "Famine* Whs re Labor Is Paid
o â¢ â¢â¢ â¢ â¢'2 Cents a Lay.
Â§.. Â°It is a rather novel mission, that of
Anagarika Dh*rmapaia from India to this
â¢country. He comes to preach humanitar
ia.nism and consideration and method, not
to speak of brotherly love, to missionaries
.â â¢ who go. into India. Five minutes in the
. company of Dharmapaia discovers to the
. â¢ least .observing a remarkable man. He is
quite youn.g in appearance â say about 32 â
â¢ ; to be possessed of bis attainments. He is
a Singhalese by birtn, he has lived in
India for many years and has adopted it
: as his .country. He has the mild, quiet
manner, but nothing of the obsequious
â¢'.ness of the Singhalese. He is tall and
.â¢ slim in figure, his skin is a deep chocolati
color, and. his eyes and long, wavy hair
a-nd'thin beard and mustache are black
m his"picture-que raiment is composed *â '-
simple windings of a bright yellow cloth.
He has complete command of English, in
â  the .use of which he permits himself a
o slight foreign accent. He is the general
secretary of the Maha-Bodi Society of In
. â¢ diÂ», which attempts a reconciliation of
Buddhism and Christianity.
â  To abjure and banish ignorance and
. â¢ superstition and selfishness â that is my
' religion," he say*. "It is my mission to
preach that, "for that is what Buddha
preached. With all the intellectual i lv
. 'mipation of .the present day there is still
â¢ ' " superstition clouding and hampering the
, mind; â¢ You don't like to sit down to
table as the thirteenth person. President
â¢â¢ McKiniey will carry with him to the
"White, House a horseshoe that has been
" presented 10 him. You say that Is but a
â¢ pleasantry, but still if the highest in the
lapd-. recognize the sign of a superstition
.even as a'joKe, how must, the mass of the
_-â¢. people feiel with regard to these same
Â". ; signs? Now,' that is what I came to say
â' . to th"ote rr ho send missionaries to India.
.' "The -common people there have. certain
â¢innocent superstitions or customs which
..\-.it'ls"T\-eU that tbo c who seek to gain their
â¢ â¢ 1 .sympathies should recognize. Suppose 1
..'../ come .here.-and have torses killed for I
â¢ 'â '. tabitf? .Would I, not prejudice the people
against me? The cow is sacred in India.
â 'â¢ Jt.is the giver of life. It is the beast o;
..' burden and" it gives mi.k. How can any
. body eat the. flesh of so us? ml an animal?
_ 'â¢Only 'the' scavenger and the missionary
; '"âdoes so in India. And the two are
â¢ â  "' cp'upled at. once in the mind of the
" . -. : people." : . â¢.. . -.
'.' â¢' "4 fie missionary goes hunting and ruth
. lessly kills in India, which is considered a i
." very base thing to do; he does not set ;
â¢ ; himself greatly against the introduction
-* gi' -Western whisky, and in many other
â¢ ..;â¢ wa\:s h"e does not .live as and is not that
: example of uprightness, purity and zeal
.-.- ' that 'i tie people expect, in an apostle of
. â¢ tie true religion.
'. â¢ â â¢' "Disregarding* the little superstitions of
. . 't.he '.people of India in a manner that Â«f
- .::-' - fronts them they, the missionaries, give
expression to their own superstitions. i
â¢ This is hat I came to confer with the
Â°. . missionaries concerning. I would say to
â  â¢. . tl em, "â¢Brothers, let us live such lives, so
upright and pure and steadfast for the
. ' truth,- Â£6' humane, so marked by brotherly
: Jove &}id kindly consideration that our
1 yes shall recommend the doctrines we
preach; let us free our ruinds rirst from
superstitions that we may be better able
to load others out of theirs."'
( "You see," continued Dharmapala,
"the people of India, the laboring classes,
are very, very ignorant â oh, so ienorant.
They know how to plow and sow and reap
and that is all. Now, when the mission
ary comes to them and preaches his doc
trine of redemption with all the force of
his intellectual powei the poor, ienorant
people accept it with all its superstitions
rather than with its higher lights. When
they are told that t eir sins shall be
washed away through the b!ool"of Jesus
they see no need of personal effort. Oh,
I think it is a great &in. That whicn de
stroys individuality is wrong. Buddha
preached tbe utmost freedom of thought
to clear the mind. Disciules are expected
to think for themselves. Then it comes
to this: that no priest is necessary. Each
individual must himself strive for the
heights."
Speaking of Buddha's teachings, Dhar
mapala said: "This is the year 2480 of
the era of Buddha. It is a popular belie;
among his followers that with the twenty
hve hundredth year there will L>e a great
revival of his teachings, which will spread
over the western world as It has hitherto
obtained in the east. The discoveries ana
teachings of Huxley, of Darwin, of Tyn
dal, ol Herbert Sceucer, Schopenheuer,
Haeckel and of Bishop Berkeley but an
ticipated the spread of the doctrine in the
west as that of Buddha anticipate them
by thousands ot years in the east.
Buddhism flourished over India and
throughout Asia for 1500 years and it
marked the period of India's glory. Oh,
vex, we nave an ethical code; we are all
right there. But as all things contain the
seeds of decay. Buddhism died in India
and is now Mroii-est in China and the
Penin-ula. We are making an effort to
revive it and have made a very good be
ginning. I would ask the Christian mis
sionaries to study this religion that they
may at least know what it is that they
wish to supplant."
Asked aoout the famine in India,
Dharmapala lifted up his hands and said:
"Ah, they are starving there, starving. It
cannot be relieved by the new crops before
May, at least, and in the meantime the
suffering is horrible. You see they had
no thought of the drouth. In ancient
times they used to store up grain to meet
such an emergency, but now the English
Government makes no provision for it,
and poor people cannot. The English
merchant offers them money, and of
course they sell. Every kernel of grain in
tne country is bougnt up and shipped out
of t c country. Tne very lowest prices
are offered them, and they know nothing
of th>- value in the markets of the world.
Consequently they are* unprepared to
meet any emergency. The crop failed,
and they starve.
"The average traveler in India gains
little knowledge of ihe real condition of
the people. The traveler >ees the hand
some houses of tbe English in the towns;
â  verythi'i _' looks trim and beautiful, and
they come away with the impression that
it is a prosperous, well-goveraed country.
They do not see ihe abject poverty and
-iaverv of the people that can be learned
by penetrating but a few mile^ away from
the station. They do not know that the
improvements they admire were paid for
at the rate of 2 cents lor a day's labor â a
day extending from early morning until
.'afe in the evenin.-. If the laborer is
specially recommended he gets 2\Â£ cents.
And to this rate of wages is added a moan
tain of taxes. They are taxed for these
sp endid 'improvements' tbat they do not
understand or appreciate; they are taxed
:or the sunport of the military and for
strateeio railroads and so on. If the
Queen invites the Sultan oi Turkey or the
Ameer of Afghanistan and spends fabu
lous snma in tue ; r entertainment, he
cost is assessed to India as being an affair
for the beneni of that country."
Mr. Dharmapaia will speak this even
ing at Native Sons' Hali under the hh
spices of Golden Gate Branc , Theosophi
cal Society, oa "Budd. ;sm and Chris
tianity."
PROFESSIONAL BONDSMEN
The Grand Jury Will Be Asked to In
vegilgHtc Frank 11. Meader.
The Grand Jury will be asked by Judge
Conlan to make an investigation into the
conduct of Frank H. Meader, who is
6urety on several Police Court bonds.
Mary Brown, alias Ei:za Kilcline, was
arrested some days a-.ro fot grand larceny.
She was relei se 1 on $2000 bonds, accepted
by Justice of the Peace Barry while pre
siding in Judge Conian's court. One of
the bureties was Meader, who gave his ad
dress as 111 Grant avenue and qualified on
a lot 25x100 leet, with improvements, at
67 Alley or Abbey street, this City.
Curia Newman, the expert, discovered
that there was no such street in this City,
but that in San Mateo County there was
a lot on Abbey street, San Mateo, owned
by Henry F. Meader. He drew Judge
Con!an's attention to the fact yesterday
and the Judge issued a bench warrant for
the woman's arrest, as she had failed to
respond to her name when called. Tbe
Judge also declared his intention of bring
ing the matter to the attention of the
Grand Jury.
The othfr surety on the bond is J. An
glade, 603 Pine street, who is all right,
having property valued at $5000.

QUEEN OF SONG
IN GRAND OPERA
Aimee Pascal Will Lend
Her Sweet Voice to
the Symphony.
With Mesdames Foeder, Berthet
and Oberthy She Will Swell
the Soprano Volume.
When the Costly Company Is Coming,
Who Is in It and What They
Will Present.
The music-loving world of San Fran
cisco is on the tiptoe of expectancy re
garding the coming of the opera season at
MLLE. AIMEE PASCAL, HIGH SOPRANO.
the California Theater. Many citizpns
have Heard the organization in New Or
leans and speak in the highest terms of
its worth. The principals ate the leading
lignts of the lyric stage from the first the
aters of Europe, and were organized into
this company not for the purpose of a
tour but expressly for the guaranteed sea
son at New Orleans, which is about to
come to an end.
San Francisco will be the only other city
in the Union to hear this complete aggre
gation of singers, as it will come uere
direct and will present the operas on a
scale of completeness that would be im
possib c were it a traveling company. In
all â principals, chorus, ballet, etc. â there
will come here over 14j people.
Tne leading soprano of the troupe is
Madame Foedor, a pretty blonde, about
the age of 23. bhe made her debut at
Nice, wuaje sue was Tery successful. She
then sang in Names, and was afterward
encaged as lirst soprano in the great the
ater oi Brussels. Madame Foeaor is also
a dramatic artist of much attainment. In
regard to her rendition of the difficult role
of Rachel in "La Juive," the New Orleans
Picayune said :
Mine. Foedor, who appeared in the title
role last night, was the same talented artist
she has shown herse.l to be in all the parts
she has played, She rose to the exigen
cies of the vocal and dramatic require
ments of the score and acquitted herself
admirably. Her voice wan displayed in
all iis beauty and power and showed the
best of schooling, joined to faultless taste
and expression. Her rendition of the aria
"II va venir" proclaimed her master of
her art and won her the favor of the pub
lic. Mme. Foedor will be heard during
the season here in her most brilliant role.",
such as Valentine in "Les Huguenots^'
Santnzza in "CavalleriaÃusticana," Anita
in "Navarraise," Pasilea in "Uenvenuto,"
etc., etc.
Nestor Massart, the leading tenor of the
organization, was formerly an officer in
the Belgian army and left the service ol
the King for the Uric staze. He made his
debut at the great Theatre de la Mon
naie in Brussels in "Faust," and was af
terward most successful in "William
Tell," "The Prophet," etc. His success
with this organization has been most pro
nounced and his appearance here in his
favorite roles will prove a decided treat
for our music lovers.
M. Prevosi, the forte tenor of the com
pany, is an exceptionally fine artist; in
fact, his equal has never been beard in San
Francisco. His Manrico in "Trovatore,"
in which be male bis debut in New Or
leans, called lorth the highest praisa from
all who heard nitn in the role. Opera
goers have in M. Prevost the much de
sirea high C tenor, and taey can now en
joy all the heavy operas to their hoarts'
content.

HORROR HAUNTS
PASTINE'S HOUSE
The Victims of the Fatal
Fungus Lie in
State.
Grief Prompts the Stricken
Father to Attempt
Suicide.
Numerous Cases Where Poisonous
Mushrooms Have Caused Serious
Illness in the Italian Quarter.
Surrounded by anxious and Joying
friends and the faithful physicians who in
relays keep up a constant vigil little
Atelio Pastine, seed 10 years, fights stub
bornly the battle of death. In tne adjoin
ing room Ricardo Pastine, the heart
broken father, lies weak from the effects
of the deadly toadstools, sobbing piteously
when he is not cruelly arraigning nimself
for bringing about the death of two, per
haps tbree, of his loved ones. The wife,
who has about recovered from her illness,
watches the mental suffering of her hus
band, and while her heart throbs with an
guish strives bravely to bear up under her
sorrow. At times the struggle proves too
great for her and she falls to the floor
shrieking hysterically.
It is an awful shadow which has fallen
on the house ot the Pastine.*. In the lit
tle sittine-room, side by side, are the
silent, white-robed bodies of little Atelio
and Tito. A mournful procession of
friends, and all the Latin quarter, who
are apparently friends of the Pastines,
passed into the room and tear.ully lifted
the cloths from the faces of the two lads
who were seized so rapidly by the awful
conqueror that their features did not have
time 10 discard the look of boyish roguish
ness that was the delight of the neighbor
hood.
In the kitchen, little Eda, upon whose
dainty body the deadly poison too*
least effect of all, sat in a little chair by
the tetove, and her great brown eye's
opened in wonder at the throng who
gazed upon her as one whom death had
given up. The ordeal had long since
ceased to amuse her.
"Tito," she cried, "come out in the yard
and play." In the pale light of the can
dle Tito lay solemnly silent, and the little
sister pouted prettily.
Nothing can dissuade Ricardo that ha
is not the murderer of his childr n. When
the first boy, As:i!io, succumbed to the
influence of the poisonous mushrooms
which Ricardo and his \ friend Santos
Cinollo gathered at Golden Gate Park, his
reason almost left him. A3 breath de
parted from th - body of tne boy, h â  cried :
"it is better that I, who have killed him.
die too." As Le said this he turned to a
bureau and drew a revolver from one of
the drawers. Cinollo observed theact just
in time, and after a struggle obtained the
weapon, which be still retains.
Dr. G. E. Caglieri, wno.with Drs. Joseph
Pescia.O.i'errone and L. D. Bicijjalupi.were
called in by Dr. E. C. Mervy. the family
physician, expresses the opinion that the
effects of ihe poison would not have been
so deadly had more of it been taken. As
it was Pastine returned to bis home with
the mushrooms Wednesday evening after
family repast had been prepared. Only a
tasie, four for a family of six, was pre
pared, and the deadly alkaloid muscarin,
one of the most pernicious poisons known,
was gradually absorbed into the system.
A larger amount would probably not
have betn retained on the stomach, but
with the small quantity consumed no ef
fects were noticed until the next morning. !
Then little was thought of it and it was j
not until Thursday evening that. Dr. ]
Mervy was called. It was then too late. |
Tue aeency of death was already coursing I
through the veins, carrying its fatal mes- |
sage to the heart.
Tue mortal effect of muscarin is to
paralyze the heart and when it has once
been absorbed in the blood the only re
course is to hypodermic injections of
atropine and strychnine, and to internal
stimulants.
By this means it is hoped to counteract
the effect upon the heart until the system
c:\iitbrowoffthepoison. In the case of
the father, tLe mother and little Eda this
course proved successful. Witb the two
little ones, who Bleep where the candles
cast the shadow of the crucifix between
them, the poison had already seized the
hearts in a death grip, and with Atelio
the battle is on.
At a late hour last ni In Atelio showed
of great improvement, and Dr.
Mervy, who was in attendance, expressed
strong hopes for his recovery.
The particular form of mushroom which
Ricardo Pastine gathered is known a* the
fly fungus on account of the small flr or
microbe to which is ascribeJ its poisonous
qualities. It is prevalent in this region
and many residents of the Italian quarter
have suffered from it. Among these Cap
tain Oirao of the Garibaldi Guards and a
number of friends recently partook and
were seriously ill.
J. Valente, of the firm of Valente, Ma
rini & Co., recently partook of the fungi
with his wire and a friend. All three were
very ill and are only just recovering. Last
season Mrs. Pendoia, who iives on Mason
street, near Green, came very near dying
from the same cause, as did more.re
cently a man named Mangini and his wife.
Arrangements have not yet been made
for the funeral of the little ones. Prob
ably they will be buried to-morrow.
ALL HAIL TO GKEEOE.
A. Splivaio Speaks a Word in Favor ot
Cretan Independence.
"All hail to Greece I" exclaimed A.
Splivaio in the course of an address de
livered last nteht at the Turn Vereln Hall,
"and may her ships as of yore sweep the
Pfiloponessus, and may her arms achieve
for the Cretan people independence as an
integral portion of a Christian country."
This sentiment was received with great
enthusiasm by the audience, which at
tended the entertainment given by the
Hellenic Mutual Benefit Society for the
benefit of the Cretan suffer rs.
Mr. Splivaio spoke of the glories of
ancient Greece in the realm of philosophy,
poetry, science, oratory and war, and
prophesied that King George would win a
second Maraihon.
Tableaux were presented during the
evening showing Crete as a little child
guarded by Greece and Liberty, while on
either hand stood two stalwart Greeks in
the national costume of Greece, one bear
ing aloft the stars and strides and the
other the Greek flag.
The ladies and gentlemen so posing
were Miss Lillie Martin. Mbs May Sopar,
Mi.-i Clio Mandafoni, Demetrius Kameia
kis and Demetrius Todatukis. The
balance of the programme consisted of the
following:
Song. TomTregellis; fancy dance. Miss Irene
Radovich; Miss Adele Linon and R. N. Walsh,
novelty musical instrumentalists; Halleu and
Hart, comedians; Harry McGuren, negro
specialties; song, G. B. Alien; boxing coti tests,
Alex Pandazes and Pat McCabe and Len Wig
gcu and Fritz Scboenfield.
A dance brought ibe entertainment to a
close. The various committees and offi
cers in charge were as follow*:
Reception committee â C. Demetrak (chair
man), D. Cnecures, >\ Dmnlanakes, A. Kosta,
C. Capiios, E Coki os, D. Samios.
F.oor dinctor, M. D. Van vales.
Floor committee â G. Fundas, P. Vrettos, A
SimacoDulos, P. Pan dazes, P. Papademou, A

occur from over-eating as from excessive
drinking.

- BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. 27.â The K reat
<est celebration ever held at the State Uni
raity took place this afternoon In com
.-r.emoration of the passage of the univer-
sity tax bill through the Legislature.
= o Governor Budd, 117 lawmakers . from
Sacramento "and a large number of other
o visitors arrived in Berkeley at about 1 I
o'clock and were accorded a royal recep- |
tion by the faculty, students and citizens of
the university town. At the station they I
â¢ were met by the student ca ets' uattalion, !
which led the march to the campus. The I
visitors, headed by the Governor, Presi- â 
dent Keliogg. Senator Stratton and As- j
"semblyman Wright, followed the soldiers
along the famous students' pathway to the
â¢ campus, where the artillery of the mili
tary department was filling the air with
. noise and smoke by firine salutes.
Luncheon was provided ,or the visitors
in- Stiles Hall by the Associated women
o students of the- university, under the di- i
rection of Miss C. Barto of the class of '93.
Covers were laid for 250 and every place
was occupied by the visitors ana their
wives, members of the faculty and other
guests of the day.
After luncheon" began the big military
*. demonstration, universally acknowledged
tOoSe one of "the best military displays j
even made by the cadets. The entire i
o battalion was drawn up near the Harmon !
Gymnasium, and passed in review before
the Governor and me legislators.
â¢ he entire* party of visitors wore blue
and gold badges. Around them was one
of the largest crowds ever seen on trie
grounds at Berkeley. Tne weather was j
. periect, and the scene was a brilliant one
as the soldiers bsgan their march toward
. Nor:h Hall, their costumes and weapons j
glistening in the sunlight.
The crowd constantly increased while
' the' preparations, were going on for the ex- j
ercises of the day. Captain Keener, the .
ir.ew superintendent of grounds and bald* j
ings, in the morning erected a new grand
-and on 'the baseball diamond containing
seats fop the speakers of the day ami other
â  â¢ ignored guesis. .
Imirieu Lately in front were several hun
dred seats reserved for visitors and behind
them were the nigh benches that do rcgu
. lar service for spectators at athletic events
â¢â  on the campus.
The brilliant military spectacle ana the
music of the U. C. band, assisted by mem
. Â£ bers of the Presidio band, were not enough j
to keep the crowd from a scramble for j
places, and 'long before the time came for
President Kehogg to call the meeting to
order every seat in the big grandstand
â¢ was. occupied and there were crowds of
â  peop'e standing around and unable to
obtain seats.
' â¢ The military review having come to a*
] close the Governor and party of legisla- j
â¢ tors, the faculty and regents, gathered un- !
fler the speakers' canopied stand, which j
. had been erected for the occasion, to listen
to the remarks which were to be made. j
.On the* baseball grand stand, the benches
. and chairs which were placed on the
' ground in the open air sat an audience of j
â â¢2000 friends of the university, including i
representatives from every class that has i
gone forth from its wails of learning.
. . It was an imposing scene. Everything
had a maniai air about it. Scattered
nere"arnd therethrough the vast throng
wene cadets in martial attire; the National
colors floated to the breeze from their
midst and the canopy under which the
distinguished cuests were seated was
draped with streamers of blue and gold
intertwined with the red, white ana blue.
AH through the exercises the greatest en
thusiasm was displayed by the audience,
particularly the students, who frequently
rent the air with their college yells and
dee p-sound'ne slogans.
Every speaker was lustily cheered, more
especially those who had been directly
connected.with the passage of the measure
which .has increased the revenue of the
union. Two men the mention of
â whose- names elicited much enthusiasm
were Assemblyman Howard E. Wright,
jschos.; name the tax bill bears, and Senator
IFred S. Stratton, who was also grently
t:.:-trumental"in the passage of the law.
â¢*ls Assemblyman. Wright came to the
nlaiform tie chorus rang out, "What's
the matter with* Wright? He's all right,
â¢ you bet â every time. Who's all right?
: Wright."*
in the fctfeech of Regent Iteinstein he
made reference to the student labor move
noen.t of a year ago, and just at the cli
xnaticpo'.nt in his allusion to the work a
'â shrill "We will!" rang out from a thou- ,
sand throats. It was "We will" that the j
students sirouted on the memorable day
when Mfcsd by Regent Re^nstein if" they
would take'off their coats and with pek
and ohovel smooth down the flinty hil
locKs on the campus and build a new en
trance to the grounds.
Those w-io were called upon to address
the assemblage by President Kelioge,
who officiated as chairman of the exer
cises, weie: Pre<i >ent Elston of the Asso
ciated Students. Professor ' William Carey
Jones, President W.liiam R. Davis of the
Alumni Association. Regent Reinstein,
A sernblvnian Wright, Senator Ktratton,

Speakers came to t c platfo-m, the
"tiudent graduates having been given pre-
e *.cedence over the Governor, legislators
'ana professors because the celebration
*as essentially a student*' affair, as it in
they who are reaping the real present and
j # diren beneht o' the new law.
Lis introductory remarks, President
Kcilogg said:
JH his is indeed a glad day for the university,
't vie friends of tne University of Calliornia
.*| â¢; 01 higher education. It is fitting that we
bÂ» uid meet here to-dny to celebrate and ihai
tXcoriein of these festivities should be in tne
.Tiniversity itself. Tne studnts are nearest o(
all to the er>"d which the S ate has ~een fit to
b. su>w upon its university, and it is they who
have;tak.-n the iniiiative in this celebration.
The object! of education are the young men
.and women of our Stale, who here prepare
themselves for future u^eiuluess and aervice.
Theinstitution has recently been in a pe
culiarly straitened condition, as may be seen
from the last biennial report; but tae people
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
of the Stnte have heard our appeal, and have
decided that the tituation shall be improved.
Their assistance jias been most unieiy.
After inviting those present to look
over the "rounds and o visit the build
ings after the exercises. President Kelicgc
introduced President Eision of tbe Asso
ciated Students, v. ho spoke as follows:
We are indeed giÂ«d to meet the friends of
the university face to face upon this occasion,
and to extend to you our gratitude lor your
liberality. The assistance which you hove
rendered us has come in an extremity. All
that we can say to-day is that "We thank
you," but in the future we hope to be able to
say more than this.
We hope to serve you as well as the alumni
here present have served us and served you.
We ook forward to a troup of noble buildings
on our most beautifully located campus, to a
large teaching corps and to a body of students
sucn a- equal Yaie or Harvard or any
other of the great universities of the East.
All this has bt.ll made possibie by the bene
ficence oi the people of the State.
Professor William Carey Jones came
next. He said:
The university stands for the whole round
of education, for tne fellowship of all that is
great and for broad iterary, philosophical,
historical and industrial culture, it stands
for the complete ami i-ystematic co-ordination
of ail the educational institutions of the Siatf.
It aims to be an organic factor of tne whole
Mate's life: it stands for characterâ character
in our young men and women; honesty and
ride.ity. To Governor Budd and to the Legis
lators of Culiioroia. the university renders
thanks for your beneficence. May the uni
versity in its li:e and work be to you a tource
of eternal comfort and satisfaction.
William R. Davis, ex-Mayor of Oakland
and president of tiia Alumni Association,
said:
The public-school system in the United
States is the greatest source of blessing to its
citizens of sli its institutions, and the bul-
irk of the public schools are the universities.
This day is the crowning and cv minaliug day
of ihe greater usefulness and greater destiny
of the University of California.
The cities about the bay are the wheel of
Western civilization, viih berkeiey as the
hub. From it I see a civilization, branching
out in every j direction .ike tne medullary
rays from the heart 01 a tree-
Repent Reinstein began bis remarks by
referring to the condition of affairs at tne
university a year ago, when, its financial
tide was at its lowest ebb.
To-day its financial condition Is better than
it has been in its entire history. It is a year
ago almost, to a day that the students assem
bled iv a battalion in iront oi North Hall to
consider whether they would iurn.sh the phy
sical strength to make the t>uildings and
grounds presentable. You know how they re
spouded. (Loud chorus of "We Will !")
It seems that the first gun of the reforma
tion was Bred by the students.
The suggestion of shoveling the earth on the
campus came from the students themselves.
Tnej were two freshmen, McLaren and Web
ster, who put the idea into my head. It was
by their seal, their energy and firmness <<f
purpose when they begun the leveling of the
roucb p'.nces on the campus that their charnc
ter was - hewn to the j eopie of the iftate, and
f\e ante in turn rewarded them for their
good works.
Assemblyman Howard E. Wright, amid
loud applause, took the platform and in
:i lew well-chosen sentences outlined the
progress of the 1 per cent bill from its
origin through the Legislature.
"Talk about your enthusiasm at BerKe
ley," said he, "the old Capitol at Sacra
mento latrly rang wilh shouts from those
who had worked night and day for the
passage of the bill."
Mr. Wright announced that the Gov
ernor had signed the bill this morning in
order that its lile as a law might date from
the occasion which the students were cele
brating. He had with him the blue and
gold pen with which the bill was signed,
and which he said he intended to present
to the regents and faculty to be placed
among the treasures of the institution.
Senator Stratton spoke at some length.
He said :
While we stood up and fought for the meas
ure, it was not because it was .Berkeley merely
thai we wished to see improved, but it was
from our desire to do all we could for higher
education in general. â¢â¢<<<â¢
Governor Bud i then said:
Twenty - four years ago I received my
diploma from tnis institution. To-day I
Biand under the same Fk â¢, on the same
campus, aui see about me a mightier ana
more powerful institution than my most
sanguine hopes of those days could'antici
pate. To-rtaj: lam happy to be the Governor
01 this p;ea. Sime, and to be Ã¼bie to sign my
name and aelp make this one of the greatest
educational institutions in America.
The university for year* has been hampered;
Its Rrowth has outfeached us revenues, but
finally rescue has come. The universiiy is
now known in the North, East, South and
West, and all of us who have been In touch
with it cherish it with our kindest feenngs.
When a graduste beanie Governor of the
State, had him^e.i become a regent, and had
appointed as reeents two other graduates, the
institution was bound to take a stride forward.
Later, wnen Â« noble woman s epped lorward
au<! offered $750,000 for its improvement, its
success was assured.
The university will never be compelled to
the Legislature again. It has now pro
vision for all time.
ctate Scbool Superintendent Black and
Dr. Joseph Le Conte also spoke. The lat
ter said :
I feel ift my duty to join with the students,
faculty and friends oi the university in re
yHdnft. One of the great functions of a uni
versity is to create that kind of politics which
will better the State and be consistent with,
the highest moral sentiments of the peocle.
If the State will cherish the university we
stand pledged to do all in our power to sup
port it and to bring It to Us highest standard
of excellence.

PERILOUS TIMES
FOR CANDIDATES
Frightened to Look Ahead,
Sideways or Even
Behind.
A Campaign on Issues Thai
Ba fl? the Diplomacy o r
tbe Keenest.
The Anti-Saloon Campaign to Ec
Made To-Day From Many
Pulpits.
Oakland Office Pan Fkancisco Call j
908 Broadway, Feb. 27. )
These be perilous times for candidates.
They are at a loss what to do. Prior to
all elections candidates are in more or
less of a quandary, but never belore have
municipal candidates been required to ex
ercise so much diligence and care with re
gard to "propriety."
So many issues have been raised, bo
The Three Men Whom the Republicans of Oakland Have Nominated for the Executive Branch
of the City Government.
many indorsements made, and bo much
requiring diplomacy baa been injected
into the campaign that wise, indeed, is
the man who can retain ail his friends and
make no new enemies during the coming
week.
The candidate hesitates to be seen near
a saloon or in the vicinity of a church
building. He must not walk down thu
street with a banker, neither must he
walk by himself. Although he i- pursued
all day and a large portion of the night
by people selling tickets to church fairs,
masquerade ball-, benefi: entertainments
and various other ways of raising money,
he must purchase fr<m all, yet he must
not let the masquerade ticket-vender
know that he bought half a dozen tickets
to a church fair, or vice versa.
The candidate is a hounded individual
and it takes Him all his time and in
genuity (o be careful that tbe right pack
is after him. A false step in this direction
mieht be fatal. Birds of a feather flock
together, but theuulucky candidate is now
wa. king Â»he streets of Oakland trying to
make it appear that his plumage i 3 en
tirely from one flock and at the same
time struggling to create the impression
that he is bedecked with fÂ»athers from
every flock, so that he can feel at home
anywhere.
To-morrow noon the candidates will
meet the if unit ipal Labor League. This
league 13 composed of bona-hde members
of trades unions and the president, CD.
Rogers, is one of the most active union
men on the coast.
"We are not taking any hand in poli
tics," said President Rogers to-day, '*ex
cept in so far as they concern our work.
We want t>> see a Council elected that will
ait intelligently and inaugurate a system
of improvement, and for this end alone
are we taking a part in this campaign.
We made no nomination for Mayor, be
cause there are at least two candidates fa
vorable to the league, and eitner is a good
man. For the Council we have made
some indorsements, all of whom wo be
lieve are favoranle to labor."
The anti-saloon committee of fourteen
Issued a manifesto to-day consisting of
ten sections. It nets forth reasons why
the saloon should be closed, and assures
the voters tnat there will he no hasty
action by the Council, even ii the ma
jority shall favor shutting up the saloons*.
One of the sections reads: "Let no one
fpar that if the saloon is voted out tho
Council will immediately pass rash and
unenforcible ordinances. If in sympathy
with the affirmative vote of the pecpl
they will, lifcc sensible men, proceed con
servatively and firmly. The saloon power
in joiitics in this c:iy would be effectively
broken. Indeed, no overmastering neces
sity of statesmanship or of politic* or of
business afj'i social life mak-'S the saloon
an i!id*'U'iiHiblc? and permanent iQMtituiion
in our civilisation."
From many pulpits to-morrow the fight
against the saloons will be carried on.
Rev. Dr. Ellis at the Centennial Presby
terian Church has chosen for his subject:
"The Christian Citizen and the Licensed
Saloon."
Rev. S. S. Palmer will preach in the
evenii'g at Brooklyn Presbyterian Church
on "Oik. ami's Opportunity; Shall the
Open da 010 Shut Up?"
Dr. K. F. Coyle to-morrow evening will
speak at the First Presbyterian Church
on the subject, "'Down With the Saloons."
At the First Free Baptist Church Rev.
Philip Grail will present a prelnde in the
â¢morning/on "The Si^niLcance of the
Present Temperance I-sue."
Dr. E. S. Chapman of the Markel-stTet
Congregational Church lias chosen "Pin.
verize toe Saloou" lor his 1 evening sub
ject.
The congregation of the First Christian
Church to-morrow night will hear Rev.
James Small speak on ''A Crime Against
Our Na.ion, or Shall the Saloons Go From
Oaklanl?" * * â¢-:
Rev. C. H. Hobart, pastor of the First'
Baptist Church, will sneak in the morn
ing on the subject, "Faith vs. Jericho,
and Votes vs. Jerry & Co." '
"To let be or not to be, that is the saloon
question," is the subject on which R v. C.
K. Hill will lecture to-morrow evening, at
the Tenth-avenue Baptist Church.
A mass-meeting of men will be held
Sunday afternoon in the auditorium of
the Y. M. C. A* building, to discuss the
*nloon question. Addresses will be made
by RevÂ«. Dr. Knmraer. Dr. Coyle, C. H.
lioou: i, James Small, Dr. Chapman and
other-*.
Next week the comraitt.ee of fourteen
will inaugurate a house-to-house canvass,
and on Monday afternoon at the Fust M.

ladies to further tne anti-saloon campaign.
WATSON'S WOES.
Forced to 1 ell the Couit How Ue Spent
JÂ£Â»ery Cent of His
Money.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 27.â W. S. Wat
son of Alurueda, whose divorce case was
tried two weeks ago, was before the court
to id morning to explain bis financial con
dition at the time of his wedding. Mrs.
Watson, wants the household furniture
and the husband contests on the ground
that the property was bouent before
marriage and with his own money.
Watson testified that at the time of the
marriage he had about $1850 in cash. By
a series' of questions >.c WÂ«u quired to
tell how much he paid lor his wedding
suit, how much lor carriages, what the
ring cost, how much the furniture cost,
and similar tr.lles. This was kepi up
until the noon lecess, and as there was
still a portion ol the money not â¢tccounted
for at ttiat time, the matter was continued
for another week.
NO HOPE POR THE PAIR
Oakland People started Too I. ate for
Succcin.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 27. â It is now
deCnueiy settled that the State Fair can
not come to Oakland for tbe next two
years. Yesterday afternoon President
James P. Taylor of the Board of Trade
sent a dispatch to Assemblyman Hart
North statine that two representatives
will ko to Sacramento on Monday morn
ing to push the matter, and if they report
favorably a delegation from this city
would follow.
"It is of no use sendine any one here
now,' said Mr. Nortii to-day. "A Wide
week has b*>en wasted by tbe apparent in
decision of Oakland, "and now at the
eleventh hour they wont to get in and
rush things. Let me explain why this is
impossiDle. Monday, the day -et for the
irnvai of the delegation, is ihe fiftv
s.venli of the session. It would take the
visitors another day or two to report, and
by that !ime thes'atutory life of the ses
sion will have expired. Had they acted
promptly the day we notified them some
thing mi^ht have been done, but now it is
a forlorn hope."
Assemblyman Frank Leavitt views the
matter in v similar way, and does not see
any chance whatever for the Fair at this
Legislature.

Who Was Stopped
by a Bullet.

Punc urel
Capture cf aa Eariy Morning Tbief
in the Kitchen of the
M tropole.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broa.iway, Feb. 27. j
A burglar was shot this morning in the
Hotel Metropole by Police Officer Henaer
â on.
About 3 a. M. the night clerk, A. T. Fin
nev, i card a door iv the ba-ement -queak
in- and went to investipate. He saw a
m in cronctiing on the steps leading to the
kitchen. Finney struck a match to see
who it was and the man shouted, while
Finney stepped to the door and called
Officer Henderson, who was ju-Â»t at the
hotel stejis making his periodical rounds.
As soon as he saw the officer the burglar
started to run through the titchen, ana
the policeman fired a shot at him, the
bullet entering i.is hip. The burglar sat
down, and while Henderson went for the
patrol wagon he was left in charge of Mr.
Leffingweli, a boarder at the hotel, who
had heard the disturbance and rushed to
the hall.
Lelh'ngwell stood guard over the burglar
and was almost scared into a fit when his
prisoner suddenly jumped ut> wMi a yel!
and exclaimed. ''I am shot!" Leinngwell
made him sit down, but the burglar per
sisted in asserting that he had been shot,
and an investigation showed that the bul
let had entered his flesh.
The fright, ned thief had sat still for two
or three minutes before the commanding
nre ence of Mr. Letfingweil and was so
awed that lie di 1 not realize he was shot
for several minutes. Wnea the patrol
wagon arrived the burglar, who gave the
name of Elmer L?tterel , was taken to
the Receiving Hospital, and after the bul
let was extracted* was sent to the City
P ison.
The prisoner said be came Irom Mon
tana and is a paper- anger by trade. He
beat his way to this ciiy from Port Costa
on a freight train. "Friday niebt." be
said, "I found the basement door of the
house next to the hotel unlocked and I
sl'pton some sacks. I looked through a
skylignt into the kitchen of the hotel and
everything looked so cozy and warm that
I thought I would go in and get a cup of
coffee. I didn't break anything to get in,
as the skylight was open. I got into the
kitchen all right, but I heard a noise and
trie.i to hide, and it was tnen that the
night clerk found me. The shot 1 re
ceived might have killed me, and I rather
wish it had. There is 00 chance for a
stranger to get work around here and I
can t see what is to become of me."
Letterell says thai the .unniest thine he
h;'S seen for a lorn: time is the manner in
which the night clerk ran away from those
stairs as soon as he said "boo" to him.
ASSERT THiiY AHE SPIES.
Two Men Caught a ul Beaten by A. P. A
Council Members.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 27.â The Oakland
Enq lirer tv-night publishes a >tory in
which it is claimed that two alleged spies
upon A. P. A. secrets were caught and
punished. The Enquirer says:
There was a very Â«'xciti ns time at the meet
ing 01 A. P. A. Council No. 17 last, evening.
For some (lone past the San Francisco Moni
tor, Rev. Yorke's paper, has b-en publishing
an account oi the doings ot the various A. P. a.
couuc.ls in Oakland, and despite every pre
caution the ro.t of members anil proceedings
o- one council after another became pubau iv
this way.
In some manner it was learned that a ceriain
man and hi.-- partner were responsible ior tnÂ«
lenk. Tht-y t>uth professed lo be connected
with an A. P. A. publication in Sau FriÂ»n-
Cisco a d visited all of the councils in the
City. Thu pub.jshfd statements in theMou;
tor grew 10 be a regular feature of the paper.
Matiers finally reached a point in which the
organization was excted with indignation,
and started on a hunt for the offenders.
Tiie man in ques.ion with nis friend was at
Council So. 17 last evening, ami were at once
accused of beiug Fahi>r Yorke's spies. In
their possession was fnun>l .he membership
roll of Couucils No. 2 and No. 51, besides other
papers which ii vtus claimed no members had
any right tv nave in their possession While
puneying as to what to do with the men, one
ol them nia;;a ,e Ito siip out of the room and
escaped.
The alarm was given and a big posse set out
afti-r him. His i.ur>urrs assert the man made
a b:>e .me for the convent of Our Linty of the
Seed Heart; but th< y overtook him, and he
was drapgtd back to the hau ana handled
quite roughly.
Wiien the hall was reached both men were
given a sevre bea iiig and escorted to the
train and shipped to San Franc sco with a
warning never 10 return on pam of death.
Someday the men were in such a couditiou
that they may not recover.
Tee su^peci.it is said, has had r room ir.
West Oak. and for some time, but has never
been seen torn ng otu the trrnit way. He was
a visitor to louncil 23, near by, and it is
thought he is the me who furnished the
Monitor with thai m nibership roll published
in last week's issue of that paper.

The Los Algodones Ranch Al
ready Lost to the Big
Estate.
GENERAL ANDRADE ACQUIRES
THE TRACT.
The Diez Government Preparing to
Confiscate S x Hundred Thou
sand Acres More.
The news comes from Mexico that a big
flice df the holdings of the Blythe estate
in that country has reverted lo the Gov
ernment, and that the. remainder of the
Mexican property is in imminent danger
of .' forfeiture. The trouble, so it is said, is
due to a failure on the part of Blythe and
his heirs to colonize the lands according
to the terms of the original grant.
In all (he Blythe possessions in Mexico
comprise about 1i40,000 acres. The greater
portion ol these are in the western part of
t n e rotate of Sonora, about eighty miles
south of Vumii, with a frontage on the
Golf of California. On the western bank
ol the Color.-ido River, near its entrance to
ihe Gull o: California, the millionaire had
a tract of 19,31) hectares, equal to about
â 4\ooo acres, known as the Lo* AJgodonea
ranch. Tiiis tract is within the jurisdic
tion of Lower California and is no longer
a portion of the Blythe estate, but the
property of General Gu.llermo Ani.rade ol
this City.
The original grant to Blythe was can
celed Ly the Mexican Government about
a year ai:o. (leneral Andrade purchased
the property shortly afterward for $10,000
in Mexican money, at the rate of about '20
cents an acre. Tue tiecl of the transfer,
which has just been recorded at Ensenuda.
is 'dated June 20, 189& The hind nits
hitherto, b; special agreement with the
rep_restf.n tut i vps of the Blythe estate, been
assessed at ti cents an acre for tax pur-
Gentral Amirade, in addition to
the Los Algodones ranch which lie has
recently acquired, already owns about
TiJO.OOU acres in the same locality. These
possessions streicu about the head of trie
if California, eastward into the State
ut Souora.
The Biytbe tract of 600,000 acres in this
State i.- about, it i? said, to follow the fate
of the Los Al^odones ranch. The land j
â war granted man y years aco to Blythe and ;
Anarade on the condition t>>at the hinds
should be colonised. No attempt was
ever* made to carry out this part of the
agreement â probably for the reason that
its rie w owners found that ihis was a bg
â per job ttian they had bargained for.
When the litigation over the millions of I
:he deao man began, the appraisers of
the estate, S. P. Middleton. Joseph El- j
d ridge and E. S. Rice, maJe a carefui ex
amination of these lands ana put their
value nl 20 cents an acre. It was the
. oolnion of the executors that they were a
sort of white elephant, and that they were
â¢â practically worthless lor any purpose
water.
An engineer was employed to pass upon
this matter, and he reported that it was
. impossible to irrigate the tract at
a cost- at all commensurate with
any prospective increase in values.
Since that time the property has remained
as it always was, a bieak and dreary waste
of rocfcs and sand .1 lines.
Some five years ago the Mexican Gov
ernment began to manifest a disposition
to. take back the property. Shortly after
Florence Bly'.he was declared the rightful
heir of the tig estate sue and her husband
paid a visit to Mexico and got a period of
grace with a view of making another at
tempt .to turn the tract to some account.
'Hie Governmeni of Diaz was in a gracious
mood, but no attempt has Mnce been
niade'to fulfill the conditions of (tie grant.
It in probable that in a few da3*s a formal
decree ot forfeiture will be issued and the
lands sola for what they will bring. It is
said that the ia;e Senator Fair was inter
ested with Blythts at one time in this prop
erty, but withdrew after he had become
convinced that as a colonization venture
it would be a bubble.
General Andrade is now in Mexico, and
i: is rumored that hin visit has for its ob
ject the purchase of this big tract. This

would give Andrade nearly 1,500,000 acres
around the Gulf of California, quite a
princely possession a^ acres go, but as
dreary and uninhabitable a waste as cÂ»n
be found in Mexico.
Andrade was a partner of Blythe in his
Mexican ventures, and was a valuable wit
ness In establishing the claims of Mr 3.
Hinckley to the estate. What ne intends
doing with his contemplated purchases is
a matter of conjecture.
The Blythe estate will not be materially
crippled by t lie loss ot its entire Mexican
holding;'. The estate is worth at least
$4,000,000, the lion part of which is com
prised in the blocK bounded by Grant
avenue, Geary ami Market streets.
In addition to tins there arc tome mines
in Trinity County and SO.OOO acres of land
in San Diego County. L:ke the Mexican
possession the San'Dieto County portion
of the estate is of little value without
water, and thus far no practical plan of
urinating it has been devised. Tne tit le
to this, however, does not hinge on aiiy
conditions to improve it.
Mr:'. Hinckley's attorneys re f use to dis
! cuss the pr mauilities of the loss of the
1 Mexican lio. dingy. It is Known they have
anticipated ihi-i condition of affairs for
some time, and lu*t summer General W.
11. ri. Hart sent : n agent io Lower Cali
fornia for the iniri use of preventing the
j purchase of the Los Algodones tract by
General Andni-.ie. When be arrived at
Hnsenada the transfer had already taken

i effort has been made to ward off further
) cancellations in Mexico.
SOUSA PLAYS AGAIN.
Gires an Excellent l'ri)Ki;iiimiii That
'Was Warmly Appreciated at the
California Theater.
Sousa, "the one and only," and his
inimitable band rendered a fine pro-
I gramme yesterday afternoon to an excel
lent audience at the California Theater.
To say tiie listeners were pleased goes
without saying, and it would be strange if
j they wen' not, for a San Francisco audi
i ence dearly loves an oncore and Sousa is
the most generous of conductors and
gracefully yields without a protest time
and again. Two encores, three encores;
; the public pimply expec;ed to near every
i one of Sousa's marches at each concert.
t-iius:i was sorry for them when he
i remembered how long it would be before
I they would hear his marches properly
I played again and wished to leave a urate
lul memory of his visit.
Sonsa's marches uave a peculiar influ
ence over the public; they are not all
; alike, yet they are all Sousaesque and
' ensily recognized. It is the rhythm which
â  slrikes not only every ear, but every foot,
: for immediately- bousa music begins an
< impromptu march sets in and the whole
house vibr.ites. Harmouy and melody
; would be ineffective without rhythm.
This is the point in which Sou^a's band
excels, and every instrument is so per
fectly in tune thai the ensemble is quite
exhilarating.
Mi.-s Northrop yesterday sang a soprano
solo from "Lucia," and rendered it quite
nicely when siie forgot her tremolo. MiÂ«s
Martina Johnstone, thÂ»* viohnisie, played
a selection of airs from Bizet' a "Carmen"'
in a very graceful :m<i artistic manner.

TO CELEBRATE ON
ITS SAINT'S DAY
Silver Jubilee of St. Pat
rick's Church to Be
Held March 17.
Magnificent Ceremonies to Mark
the Stability of a Great
Moral Bulwark.
Faithful S?rvicÂ« of Two Beloved
Priestsâ History of the Progress
of the Parish.
St. Patrick's Church will celebrate its
silver jubilee on Merch 17 with peculiar
splendor and magiiilicence.
Tne event is specially notable, markine
as it will the stability ol an institution of
wide benevolence and consistent well
doing. Under the faithful direction of
Uev. John Maginnis and Hey. P. J. Grey,
the "first, last and. only"' pastors, the
arduous labors ol a peculiarly tuickly
populated district have been steadily
prosecuted. The friends of the church
and the pastors are legion and they will
hasten to co-operate with them in return
ing fitting thanks upon the attainment of
such a memorable milestone in the his
tory of the parish.
At the celebration of the coming silver
jubilee of the church all the magniticen t
ceremonies for which the Catholic church
is so remarkable will be displayed. The
celebration will last three days and wi ll
be of a strictly religious nature. The de
votion will assume the form of a triduum.
Besides the devotional exercises there w ill
be three sermons each day, which will be
preached by weli-known priests of the
diocese.
The Very Rev. Father Frendergast, Vicar
(ieneral of tlie archdiocese, will open the
triduura with an appropriate sermon on
Sunday evening, March 14, and on the
morning of St. Patrick's day the triduum
will be brought to a close by the singing
of the pontifical high mass by his Grace
Archbishop I*. \V. Riordan. The sermon
on that occasion will be preached by the
Rev. P. C. Yorke, the Chancellor of the
archdiocese. A grand musical programme
has been specially prepared lor the occa
sion by Professor bolirmnnn.
In connection with this memorable cele
bration soraethii g of the history of the
steady progress of Bt Patrick's Church
will be of imerest.
On Pentecost Sunday, June 0, 1851, mass
was said for the iirÂ«t "time in the district
attached to St. Patrick's Church. The
first mass was celeorated by Rev. John
Maginnis, who was then the only priest in
the City of San Francisco who could
preach in the English language. As there
was no church in the district at that time
the mass was said in a private chapel.
Three we^ks later Archbishop Alemany,
who had assigned Father Mag:n;iis lo the
district, was presented with a piece of land
on which to build a church, orphan aÂ»y-
lorn, hospiial and Ischoo!. This land was
the nift of M< ssrs. John Sullivan, Timothy
Murphy and Jasper O'Farrell.
Immediately Archbishop Alemany in
structed Father Maeinnis to commence
these buildings. No time seems to have
been lost in doing so, for by September 1 a
temporary building was erected which
served the purpose both of a church and a
school. The school until the arrival of
the Sisters of Charity was under the
sj>ec-.ai Mipervision of~Father Maginnis
assisted by one lay teacher.
Notice was then sent to all the parish
ioners to meet on the first Sunday of No
vember for the purpose of selecting a
patron saint for their new church. The
meeting was according held and the
vast majority of those who came voted
that St. Patrick, "the Apostle of Ireland,"
be chosen as the patron Thus, the
name of the church and the parish was
the free and deliberate choice of the par
ishioners. Ever since then every churcii
in the district has been known as St.
Patrick's.
The church having been built and the
patron now selected, the Rev. Father Ma
pinnis was, by his Grace Archbishop Ale
many, regularly appointed pastor of the
new parisn on December 22, 1851.
There were but two parishes then in the
City of San Francisco, St. Francis' and St.
Patrick's. The parish of St. Patrick com
prised the district bounded by Pine street.
Jolinscm (now Ninth), Mission Creek and
the Bay. St. Francis' parish comprised
the rest of the City.
On July 5, 1862, seven Sisters of Charity
embarked at New York or. their way to
Ban Francisco to take charge of the or
phan asylum, hospital and school. Two
of these sisters. Sister Honorine Goodman
and Sister Mary Green, died ot fever
while crossing the Isthmus of Panama,
the remaining riveâ Sister Frances Me-
Ennn, superior; Sifter Fidelis Buckley,
Bister Sebastian Doyle, Sister Bernice
Williams and S;ster Corsica McKey â ar
rived in SÂ«n Francisco on the steamer
Golden Gate on August 18 and immedi
ately took possession of the temporary
residence erected for their accommoda
tion.
They brought a child with them to San
Francisco, me daughter of a soldier oi the
United .States atrmy, who>e mother died
a few days afer the steamer had left
New York. This chiid became the rir>t
inmate of the Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum of San Francisco. The present
orphan asylum of South San Francisco,
which now carts for i-o many hundred
children and which has since then cared
for so many thousand, began its history
in this very humble way. The school
also counts troru this date.
The district in wtii h St. Patrick's
Church was situated was in those eariy
'lays known by the su/gestive title of
Happy Villey; it 1- no T .v known by a title
which, although equally suggestive, is
not at all a* complimentary.
But although "the orphan asylum had
but one inmate in 1861, in 1854 the num
ber had increased to sixty, and the num-

ber of parishioners of St. Pa- rick's had
very much incroaaed also, and it wa*
thought advisable to build another
church and use the old one for the ac
commodation of the orphans. Accord
ingly, on June 1, 1854, a haw church was
commenced, facing on Market street,
where the Palace Hotel is now, ami on
August I*: following it was opened for
divine service by Archbishop Alemsny.
On March 17, 1855, Bye more Sisters of
Charity arrived in San Francisco in order
to share t!ie laDors of the live who bad
since 1851 been attending ur.auled to the
school and orphan asylum, lister Freder
i<a, who at present has charge of St.
Patrick's Boys' School, was one of the live
late arrivals.
In 18*52 the pastor of St. Patrick's, Rev.
Father Maginnis, being aivauced in years,
and his health failinc, owing to thÂ« many
and arduous duties to which he hud for s >
long to attend, petitioned bis <Jrace Arch
bishop Alemany to be relieved of his
charge, and on June 1 of that year tne
Archbishop Graciously acceded to his re
quest and appointed tue Rev. P. J. Grey
to succeed him. A few months afterward
Father Maginms retire i Id Mount
Joseph's Orphan Asylum, where he died
about two years later.
The church built lor Father Martinis
in 1854 wus for many years capable of ac
comniottatinc all the Catholic* of the
parish, but in 1868 tlio number of Catho
lics became so great 'hat the cluircn was
no longer able to hold them ali. Tnen
Father Grey bought the ground* on Mis
sion str et between Third and Fourth, on
which the pre-ent imposing eJitice stands,
for $40,000. This church was commenced
in April, 1870, and was dedicated by Arch
bishop Alcm.itiy ..n the least of St. Pat
rick, March 17, 18721 Hence it ia that the
silver jubilee, or twenty-fifth anniversary
of its dedication, will be celebrated on Bt.
Patrick's day oi this year.
St. Patrick's Church, which was re
placed by the church known ut present
by that name, was, after the baiiaing of
ihe new structure, moved to Eddy -.treet,
between Octavia and Laguna, wlicre,
under the title of S:. John's Church, the
people of the district worshiped over
twenty years. It was then moved further

the last seven years it has been located on
Eddy street, between Scott and Devisa
dero, having for its present pa&tor the
Rev. Father McGinty. An interesting
history has this old church.
Twenty-five years ago, when the pres
ent church of St. Patrick's parish was
dedicated. Father Grey, who is the pres
ent pastor, had then been in charge of
the parish for ten years. His assistants
at that time were Rev. William B. O'Con
nor, who is now pastor of St. Mary's
Church, Stockton; the Rev. P. Power,
who is at present pastor of St. Michael's
Church, Livermore, and the Rev. Thomas
Larkin.
Since the dedication of the church
many improvements have been made
with regard to its interior. The beautiful
altar which is so much admired by all
who see it on account of iis naturalness
and the wonderful work in the way of
hiuid-carving that is there displayed, was
purchased by Father Grey in Munich
when he made a tour of Europe in 1876.
It cost $6000. The stained glass windows
around the altar were purchased by him
on the same occa^on. These windows
are in themselves unique, being probably
tne only ones in the City of a similar
quality. The chimes or bells, which were
purchased by the late Peter Donahue in
ISSO in Troy, N. V., at a cost of $7000 and
presented by him to St. Patrick's, are tne
only ones on the coast.

The late Mathlas Eberhart had views of his

condition that 11 she remarry, she must give

St. Paul's Senior Branch of the Leacue
of the Cross gave a Hiph Java to its
friends in St. Paul's Hall on Twenty
ninth street last Thursday evening. The
hall had been very tastefully decorated,
and there were covers for 110 people. Dur
ing the evening th-ro was a good pro
gramme of sinking, recitations and
response-* to toasts that were offered. The
manner in which the evening was spent
shows that the young men who belong to
Bt, Paul's parish can enjoy themselves
without the adjunct of vinous and
spirituous beverages. As a result of the
entertainment, before adjournment a

Tne .family' consisting of her father,

. cover of a convenient ledge. The shanty
, as a" miserable structure of two rooms,
'l/ut rt held- 'what many a grander dwelling
failed" to contain, a loving household.
The mother lay sick with the fever, ana
Carmen, 'then a girl of 12, performed the
'irudeery of the house. Her little brother,
Â a", curly-headed romp of five, was Car
â  een's' great responsibility. The father
\ â¢was away from early morning until late
at night" at- his work, and so the little
lianas of 12 found plenty to do. In com
"moh -with, the custom of miners, the
i&Uier kept a store of giant powder in the
"house," which in the present case was con

.find- t.hat 'the roof was afire and sparks |
â dropping down.
;."f:pringing up, she loudly cried to â â 
.'aw-aken her-- mother and Tommy, but the
lit tie -boy became frightened and hid his i
â ';He"ad Deneath the covers of his bed. Car
â rn"er> sprang to lift him from the bed i
when-she saw a shower of sparks falling j

Lthorild do so. For the better qualities

â¢is apt tÂ© overlook the lesser in its contem

her homeward journey by way of the rail
road-track discovered a broken rail, and,
taking off Her petticoat, waved it
toward the coming passenger train,
found herself famous because of the cir
cumstance's which placed her act so prom

the praises of the heroine and placed her
name upon the lips of the multitude; but
the other girl, who from childhood labored
and slaved to support with the toil of her
hands a sick mother and a drunken father
until when death brought a blessed relief it
loqnd her a woman in years, but past the
realization of; a woman's hopes, was a
greater heroine although unknown.
Noble, deeds are not confined to the
crowded battlefield. The self-sacrifice
made by humble hearts in lowly life, of 'en

Tp-HE Gualala River region is sur

river itself rises in the neighborhood of
F.>rt Ross and flows northerly, paralleling
the ocean's shore, until it empties into the
?e3 just on the dividing line between Men
docino and Sonoma counties. It flows
through a country that alternates from
DC uMon.il clearing*, where the dairyman
finds sweet and abundant fodder for his
henls, to a region ciothed in the densest
forests, that have so far been undisturbed
y the wooJman's ax and with a prospect
of continuing in that state until the com
mercial demands for the products of the
redwoods encompass the fall of these
monarchs of forest growth.
The coast presents the saroo character

San Francisco Bay to Oregon. B.uffs ex

landings, but no ports. The whole aspect
of the country from the ocean is wild and

rolling hills and rocky heanlands, with

she presides at the executive mansion.
Tne President dines only at Cabinet

Quite as celebrated are the dairy prod

Through every valley and down the pre

It is no wonder, therefore, thnt so

have been attracted by so lovely a spot â
well watered throughout its lenctti ana

Though settled early in the history of
the State, there remain at this flay por

nature created tnem. This is particularly
the case in that section lying beyond the
summit of the ran^e bordering on the

and approach by the sea is possible only
in exceptionable weather, when the rein

extending ft'X) or 600 feet receive their

BIRD-MUSIC IN MILL VALLEY
Success of the Experiment of Importing Feathered Songsters
From Foreign Glimes
SiVER in Mill Valley, in Marin
J County, beneath the shadow of
ji Mount Tamalpai*. where the great
redwood trees rear their massive trunks
heavenward and the freedom and beauties
of nature abound, the energetic citizens
have attempted an exper m^nt in the im
portation of songbirds with a degree of
success that has attracted tte attention of
other favored communities, which, it i*
safe to say, will follow Mill Valley's ex
ample, and the leathered songsters of
foreign climes will become scattered over
the broad expanse of the State to multi
ply in vast numbers. Were the birds only
pretty to look upon and a pleasure to listen
to their propagation might be considerei'.
in the nature of a luxury, but the greate-t
benefit is the protection which the birds
give by assailing every insect that lives
upon and destroys the plants. Ttie de
vouring caterpillars â¢which feed upon the
delicate leaves and mar the natural beauty
of the trees are quickly disposed of by the
birds.
The experiment made by the people of
Mill Valley required but a small outlay.
The sum of $_'(>Â« 90, all of which was raised
by popular subscription, is the total
amount expended by the society, and
through tneir courtesy The Call is en
abled to give the figures and expenses in
more detail. The aviary cost ijfiL 65 ami
was erected on tiie property of one of the
members of the society, Dr. Barkan.
Keeper's fees, seed, manure, provisions
and carriage hire amounted to $27 75. Ten
pairs of skylarks at $4 a j.air, 10 pairs
J forests of these majestic trees to excite the
j wonder of the present generation. The
j occupation of the region is almost solely
: in lumber, though in time to come the
r dairy interest will supplant it. For .lum
bering the country is well adapted, near
! to the ocean and the great markets, while
j th â¢ Guaiala River an.i its tributaries af
ford abundant power for the mill ami
easy . cces* to th? sea. To one unfamiliar
with the means of marketing lumber a
visit to a lumber camp on the Uua!ala af
fords a new sensation. A meander
through the silent forests will* induce re
flections in the most unimpressionable.
There is a majesty, a stillness in the<e
mighty lanes of great trees that is apt to
seriously affect even on^> whose sense of
his own importance la of the most ex
aggerated character. The great teams of
soni6iimes forty oxen dragging one o:
those grÂ»at redwood trunks to the mill is
a sight for jaded intellects, while the com
munion with the hardy and unconven
tional lumbermen, rough in manners anr<
reckless in speech, is an experience that
opens up a new vista of life. Those who
know least about this venturesome and
hazardous life are the ones who most
enjoy a near view of it.
Aside from the industrial capabilities of
I chaffinches at $3 a pair, 10 pairs thrushes
Â»1 >S a pair and 10 pairs goldfinches at
$2 7a a pair amounted to $177 50.
The idea df importing songbirds to fill
| the woods about Mill Valley with their
merry warbling w:Â«.s suggested aboui a
year ajro, and while many favored the ex
â¢ periment few could be found with suffi
; cient courage to undertake the work.
Finally, through the efforts of Anton
Michnliischke, a few lovers of buds came
together for the purpose of thoroughly
discussing the proposition, and shortly
i after this meeting the Society for the Ac
. ciimation and Protection of Singing Birds
! of Mill Valley was formed. Arrangements
j were immediately made for the purchase
! of a consignment of foreign songbirds,
j and Dr. Barkan offered the society the
j free use of hi 9 property on which to erect
j the aviary where the birds could be kept
[ until they had become acclimated.
The membership of the new organiza
tion increased as iniercst in the project
was manifested and the following well
known gentlemen compose the society:

Mr. M elialifschke was the prime mover,
and in the face of discouraging remarks
the Gualala region, the opportunity which
it offers to the person in search of recrea
tion is indescribably fine. The river itself
is a mountain stream feel by affluents from
the purest springs of the highest altitudes,
the very ho lie of the California trout.
Wliere else in the world can more com
plete and satisfying st>jrt be loond for the
angler? Flowing through a country where
the population is comparatively sparse,
these tributaries of the Gualala are rarely
fished. The angler is the master of the
situation. The number of trout that he
may capture is unlimited. He need only
to relate the experience of one day's catch
on ihe Gualala to entitle him to the proud
distinction of the champion prevaricator
on subjects of fish In his club! The Gua
lala is accessible from Cazadero by stage.
Tiie route over the hills is romantic and
varied. The traveler will find thÂ« people
of the region most hospitable and accom
modations excellent. The views were
taken by Charles -Weidner, an enthusi
astic angler, who records some wonderful
catches.
The clothing of the British army and
navy together costs tho country between

! from people who prophesied ill luck and
' failure, the work of the society progressed.
| During the first week of last November
â  the birds arrived in Mill Valley, there be
ing four varietiesâ skylarks, chaffinches,
! thrushes and goldfinches. The larks
j could not be caged. They sing only aa
;hey soar and experience has shown that
they are liable to injure themselves in con
finement. They were consequently liber
ated on the open hillside. One lusty male
J took to the wing immediately, being eyi

A new difficulty confronted the society
; in the shape of the small boy with a pop
j gun- If these lads were allowed to shoot
i at the imported birds the work or" the
! society would have been for naught, and
: so Justice Thomas Fottrell was appealed
to. lie issued a manifesto that had the
I desired effecr, and the dire punishment
i with which the small boy was threatened
i had immediate effect and no trouble waa
experienced from this source. Then the
small boy and the popgun were turned to
advanta.e, for the society offered a bounty
for the scalp of all bluejaya shot in Mill
Valley. These birds not only attempt to
kill the songsters, but rob their nests,
break the eggs and kill the young. To
exterminate them the society proposes to
adopt stringent methods.
After being confined in the aviary since
the first week in November of last year,
the thrushes, go:dtinches and chaffinches
were given ;heir freedom last Sunday
morning. It took almost two hours to
drive the birds from the aviary. For al

there, and they seemed reluctant to leave.

Parting was over at last, aud all the good-bys
had Deen spoken;
Up the long hi.lside the wide-tented wagon
moved slowly.
Bearing ihe mother and children, while on
ward before them the father
Trudged with his gun on his arm and the
faithful house dog beside him,
Grave and sedate, as li knowing the sorrowful
thoughts of his master.
April was in her prime, and the day in its
dewy awakii.g;
Like a great flower, alar on the crest of the
eastern wooiland,
Goldeuly boomed the sun, ana over the beau-;
tiful valley,
Dim with its dew and shadow, and Dright with
its dream of a river.
Looked 10 the western hills, and shone on the
humbib pio^ession.
Painting with splendor the children's eyes,
aud the heart of the mother.
Beauty and fragrance and song filled the air
like a palp^bie presence.
j Sweet was the .-mell of the dewy leaves and
the il iwcri in the wild wood.
Fair the loug reaches of sun aud shade in the
aisles of the forest.
Glad of the spring, nnd of love, and of morn
ing, the wild birds were singing;
Jays 10 tac!i otrMir ca.led harshly, then mel
lowly fluted together;
Sang the or.ole sours as golden and gay as his
plumage.
I Pensively piped tha querulous quails their
greetings uufrequent,
j While, on the meadow elm, the meadowlark
gushed forth In music,
j Rapt, exultant, and shaken with the great joy
of liis singing;

air, the kingfisher
Hung ere he dropped, like a bolt, in the water
Lo:ieaUi him; '
Gossiping, out of the bauk flew myriad twit
tering swallows,
I And in the boughs of the sycamore quarreled
aud clamored the blackbirds.
Never for these things a moment halted the
movers, but onward
Up the long hillside the white-tented wagon
moved slowly,
Till, on the summit, that overlooked all the
beau i if ul valley,
Trembiiug and spent, the horses came to a
standstill unbidden.
Then from the wagon the mother in silence
to: down willi her children,
Came and stood by the lather, and rested her
hand on Ins shoulder.
! Long together they gazed on the beautiful
vauey beiore them;
; Looked on the well-known fields that stretched
away to the woodlands
j Where, In the dark lines of green,, showed the
milk-white crest of the dogwood,
Snow of wild plums in biooiu and crimson
tints oi the rosebud ;
Looked oa the pasture fields, where the cattle
were laziiy grazing,
Softly and sweet and clear came the faint, far
notes of tho cowbells;
j Looked oa the o.t-.rodden lanes, with their
elder and blackberry borders;
Looked on the orchard, a bloomy sea, with its
billows of blossoms;
j Fair was ihe scene, yet suddenly strange and
all unfamiliar,
! Like as the faces of friends when the word of
farewell has been spoken.
Lohjc together they gazed; then at last on the
little log cabin.
Home for so many years, now home no longer
forever.
Rested their tearless eyes in the silent raptura
of anguish.
Upon the morning air no column of smoke
from the chimney
Wavering, silver and azure, rose, fading and
brightening ever;
Shut was the door where yesterday morning
the children were playing;
Lit with a gleam of the sun, the window
stared up at them blindly ;
Cold was the hearthstone now, and the place
was forsaken and empty.
Empty? Ah, no, no! but haunted by throng
ins and tenderest fancies.
Sad recollections of all mat had ever been, of
sorrow or gladness.
Once more they sat in the glow of the wiae
red fire in the winter;
Ouce more they sat, by the dcor in the cool of
the still summer evening;
Once more the mother seemed to be singing
her babe there 10 slumber;
Ouce more the lather beheld her weep o'er the
child that was dying;
Once more the place was peopled by all the
Past's sorrow and gladness!
Neither mmht speak for the thoughts that
came crowding their hearts so,
Till, in their ignorant sorrow, aloud* the chilÂ«

Then was the spell of silence dissolved, and
the father and mother
Burst into tears aud embraced, and turned
their dim eyes to the westward.

A BOURNEMOUTH NURSE.
California Sequel to an
Incident at Vicksburg's Siege
TjgjjjT^ALTER MEAD of this City has I
flip in his po^e^sion a cane whose
*lf('llfil historical associations make it
of extraordinary value. It commemo- 1
rates two occasions when fraternal feel
ings were aroused in the breasts of for
mer foes. The cane, however, is not with- i
out intrinsic. value, as it is of ebony and
mourned with gold. On its head are in
scribed a few words that tell in part its
history.
Just before the surrender of Vicksburg
the Tenth Michigan Regiment was sta
tioned before the invested city on its bluffs
beside the Mississippi. The particular day
which partly led to the existence of the
cane now so proudly treasured by Mr.
Mead was one of particular glooni to a
little band of discouraged and disheart
ened officers of the Confederate army, who
were held as prisoners by the Federal
soldiers.
Colonel Lum. an uncle by marriage of |
â¢ Mr. Mend, was then in command ot the
Tenth Michigan and a brigade encamped
â¢ ' In front of the besieged city, and he took
pity upon the forlorn condition of the offi
cers of the Southern army and, hoping to
lighten, for a little while at least, their
burden "of sorrow, invited them to dine
with him. That was a dinner whose his
tory has never before been written.
The gracious colonel of the Union forces
proved a most admirable host, and durinz
the progress of the banquet which he
spread before them he made his prisoner
guests forget their troubles. All the deli
cacies for the table possibly procurable at
the time he spread before the hungry Con
" federates, and kindly toasts were proposed
and drunk in sparkling champagne. At
the conclusion of the feast the Southern
prisoners arose from their seats and cave
three hearty cheers for their Northern
host and their captor.
It was the cane which Mr. Mead carries
that brought this story to light. In all
" the histories and narrations of the war it
had never been written; like many an
other touching incident of the Civil War
it lived only in the memories of those who
participated in the incident. Historians
had not recorded it; bards had not sung
of it, and it was only through a coincident
â¢ that happened here in San Francisco that
the present narrative is written.
When tho Tenth Michigan Regiment
was mustered out of the service its officers j
and men presented Colonel Lum with the
cane Mr. Mead now carries. The colonel
in his declining years gave it to Mr. Mead.
One day the latter was talking to his
friend, Dr. Ernest, when the doctor re
marked the beauty of the walkinc-stick,
and taking it into, his hands read the in
scription. Dr. Ernest fought for the Con
federacy; was at the siege of Vicksburg,
and the inscription on the cane brought
back to his memory the story of the din
ner which Colonel Lum had given to his
foes-in-arms held as prisoners during the
siege of the Mississippi city, and he re
lated it to Mr. Mead.
A few days previous to this Mr. Mead J
] icans y stle and elbow each other on the !
1 promenades, in the gamine-rooms. Every
; thing is gay, a little vulgar, ' infinitely
! varied and brilliant.
Bournemouth is peopled by an exclusive
! aristocracy of retired civil service and
i army officers, or by these who have the
â  mournful and not uncommon distinction
!of weak lungs. The iittie town has two
I seasons.
"in summer, 1 ' says Kaie, the chamber
maid, "the jolly people comes; in winter
; them as wants to get well."
At present, to judge by appearances, it
is the delight or the depth of the winter
season and the people who "wants to get
well" are very evident indeed.
The first impression of the place is an
entirely cheerful one, it the weather is
bright and clear. Tue long shaded ave
nues are guiltless of a fallen leaf or flutter
ing bit of paper; alorg the cliff, several
; hundred feet above the sea, the promenade
[ is crowded by pedestrians and chairs drawn j
j by microscopic ponies or littie donkeys I
| with spindling leg*. Children in bright
! red coats and stockings hop about like
' flamingoes: the air is full of the jingle of
the little bells on the heads of the horses;
the little sharp ting of the bicycles warn
i ing the unwary.
And everywhere the glance and gleam of
the sun in a glare on the white roads, like
a green flame in the trees, bringing into
vivid light the white, yellow and red roofs j
. of the villas, and in the water an intoler- !
I able b. miling radiance. And then there is
a cough, a little strangled sound, and as if
by a preconcerted signal, as an orchestra
answers to the leader's baton, there is a
pathetic chorusâ children with the whoop
; ing cough, old men with the asthma and
I children and young girls and men and
i women, old and young, with that little
dry, backing cough that is so unmisiak
| ably consumptive.

cated, recent, modern. A little stream

had received a letter from Colonel Lum
in which he was informe i that the
colonel's old recimental surgeon, Dr.
Parsona, was about to visit this City. Dr. I
Parsons had also been at the siege of I
Vicksburg, and when Dr. Ernest told tho
story of the dinner given by Colonel Luni
to me Confederate soldiers it occurred to
Mr. Mead that it would be pleasant to i
bring these two â who had served in the
same capacity with the opposing forces,
and who were so closely associated with
the memories that clustered about the
cane he so proudly carries â together in
friendly intercourse.
And so it came about that when Dr.
Parsons reached the City he dined with
the man who hac! attended to the
wounded within the Confederate lines at
Vicksburc, while he ministered to the
sufferings of the Union soldiers injured
during ti.e siege of the beleagured city,
and with the cane presented to Colonel
Lum by the soldiers of the Tenth as a
text they, in kindly* words, fought and
won fields o'er again.
The incident is rendered more striking
because of the fact that so far as is known,
it was Mr. Mead who first suggested that
the graves of the soldiers oi the South and
of the North should be decorated on the
same day. Mr. Mead has been for years
the San Francisco correspondent of the
Nevada City Transcript, and on one Deco
ration day he wrote an article ior that
paper advocating the decoration of the
graves of Confederate soldiers as well as
those who fought for the Union, on thai
same sacred day. It is probable that in
this article the idea that led to the build
ing of the Unionist monument at Chicago
was conceived.
Volumes That Qo Unread.
This is the season when the different
cities of Europe and America exchange
bound volumes of their annual reports,
and almost every mail brintrs to the
Mayor's office a Dook containing the sta
tistics of Knoxville or Denver or Quebec
or Halifax. The Mayor's messenger is
engaged in arranging these reports in the
archives of the city, where they are
likely to remain for an indefinite period,
because life is too short for the average
New Yorker to pay any attention to the
internal affairs of Kalamazoo or the im
provement of New Bedford's waterfront.
An examination of theÂ»e volumes, how
ever, gives some instruction. It shows,
for instance, the vast expense to which
the Canadian cities go in the preparation
of these sample volumes. When the
Montreal reports came in the other day
the appearance of the volumes astonished
Clerk Burrows. "If we went to such ex- I
pense as that here," be declared, "a Ben

A VILLAGE SCENE NEAR BOURNEMOUTH-BY-THE-SEA.
Around it, however, are Â«>ome of the
most interesting and ancient ruins and
pastoral scenery, as yet unspoiled by the
tourist or the advent of the railroad. The
Priory of Christchurch is an easy five
miles, and near it are the o'd ivy-grown
and mess-thatctred villages which we read
of in delightful Btory-books or see in old
pictures by Wilkie or Gainsborough.
Wilkie himself might have used lford for
a background for his little painted come
dies of rural life; a clus.er of quaint cot

Nothing like the valedictory address of
Alph Desjardins. the outgoing Mayor of
Montreal, could be heard in the United
States, as can be seen from ihe Tollowintc
paeagrapn:
"The Mayor of this city reigns like a
constitutional king, but, contrary to the
king, whose ministers are alone responsi
ble, he who has no ministers and enjoys
no control over the Aldermen, is more
enine in distance to the artist's color, a
curious, deep, mist,* purple.
The pleasure gardens and the cliff walk
divide the town. To those who are strong
enough the pleasure gardens form the
greater attraction. There is the far-famea
Invalid's Walk, where all the convales
cents meet and regard each other with
that curious misgiving, that kind of mu
tual defiance, that unfortunates so fre
quently have. Nevertheless there is a
kind of melancholy cameraderie between
some members, chiefly the more ad
vanced in years, who meet and discuss
symptoms and relate anecdotes of others
similarly afflicted.
It was to the enterprise ot an adven
turous gentleman with a passion for walk
ing that Bournemouth owes its founda
tion. He bought a vast tract of heath and
pine so as to be able to take his walks un
molested. Curiosity led him to explore
tuis district, and on the edee of the wast ',
rannfnc down to the sea, he came upon
this sheltered valley of unusual beauty.
He called it his "treasure valley," built a
villa and gradually invited a few chosen
friends to fallow bis 'laniile. It was in
lS3ti that the first hotel, the Bath Hotel,
was started, and from that Bournemouth
has grown like a mushroom.
The cliff wa'k has a faint resemblance
to the Cliff Hou-e walks at home ; away to

who answers her confidences by shakes of

Music Hath Influence Over
Even the Spider and Its Species
of the most striking illustrations
l"C:|r OI lne fact that the appreciation of
!*â <!-* ncusic extends to anim.iis and in
sects, great and smell, has jint taken
piace at Coldwater, M:ch., where a spider
has developed musical talent of surprising
force. Not only does he keep time to the
music, but the sound of discord rills his
mind with horror and he flees from tho
noise as from the wrath to come.
It is likely that about the last of ail
things to be thought of as being appre'
ciative of music is the spider. Legend has
given him a reputation for patience and
experience has shown him to be frequently
vicious and sometimes dangerous, but as
to musicâ that is an accomplishment
which i.one have ever dreamed of credit
ing him with. The rouÂ»h, hairy creature
one sometimes looks at beneath the mag
nifying lens of a microscope seems to be
of that quality to which discord would be
music and music discord. The spider at
Coldwater, Mich., however, who has first
made the musical taste of nis species
public, seems to be possessed of all the
laughter and splutter and couzhs. The
general has an air of fierce triumph.
"That old man's goin' fast," she con
tinued, turning her attention. "I warned
him last year his doctor didn't understand
his case. Isaidtohim, 'major,' I said" â
and here the medical details are over
whelming, and we rise and walk in, 10 be
ourselves the next victims, we are assured,
to be buried within a year, with all due
ceremony and great cheerfulness by the
"general."
If ti.e general has a delight in mortuary
details the "philosopher" ignores them
entirely, except in regard to himself. The
"philosopher" is a little, swarthy child
with wild black eyes like those of a
startled animal. He is a South American,
he tells us in a pdlite, very much bored
little voice; he has been ai school; his
mother is dead; his father is in Santiago;
his nurse takes care of him, but he thinks
that very soon she will be able to go back
to South America."
"Will you go with me?" she asks, in
Spanish.
"No," he replies, in Euglish; "I shall
be dead."
He says "dade," and the nurse does not
understand.
"I speak English," he continues, "she
is very foolish about it. It is better to be
'dadu' than only half alive." We are

is an impresario high in the estimation cf
those of his kind.
The remarKable qualifications of the
Michigan spider first became evident at a
j rehearsal of the Apollo Male Quartet at
I CoKiwater, the members of which are,
with one exception, residents of the towu.
The tir^t teuor is Professor Harriman,
teacher of sciences in tJie Lansing (Mich.)
high school. Mr. Baiiey, the second tenor,
is the editor of the Coldwater Star. Mr.
Grobe, first bass, is a dry -goods merchant,
and Mr. Keene, second bass, is one of the
staff of the Coldwater Sun. All these gen
tlemen are willing to vouch for the mu
sical taste of the spider, because they all
saw what he did. Compared to him the
educated flea is an ignoramus and the fly
that performs curious antics simply a
freak.
It so happened, not many evenings ago,
that the quartet was holding its regular
rehearsal. Song after sons? was tried and
not fouivi wanting, and the members of
the organization were in high giee that
ail was prospering. Another sour was
begun, when Mr. Bailey noticed a large
spider who dangled in a visibly excited
manner in front of the music-rack, just
about five feet from the floor. It was
"Down in the Cornfield" that was bein
rendered and the singers â Mr. Bailey hav
ing called their attention to tne spider
observed that tee insect went up and
down with tne variation of the scale. At
first they thought it was accident, that a
draucht ol air of tneir own lung-power
swayed the tiny insect. Stili, the time
the spider kept was perfect, and if. soon
became evident that it was a draught that
was moving n â it was a musical drauebt,
indeed.
This state of affairs naturally interested
the quartet in great degree, and they be
gan to try various airs for the sole purpose
of noting their effect upon the seemingly
highly inteiested auditor. They also ob
served that the slightest evidence of dis
cord in their rendering of a song pro
voked violent indignation on the part of
the spider, who on such occasions would
oscillate in a manner both vigorous and
vicious. Further tests showed that the
spider would ascend or descend about a
loot for every octave. The voice of the
singer might be tbe highest tenor, or the
heaviest bass, the spider never swerved
from the absolutely correct movement.
The time he kept was as creditable to him
as tbe most finished technique to the di-
cipl-s of Paderewski.
Presently the quartet sang "The Now
Bully." When they came to the line "I'se
looking for dat bully and he mus' be
lound," the spider nearly went beside
himself with glee. It seemed as if he not
only appreciated the very catchy music,
but the import of the song as well, and
could in his mind's eye view the rolling

â¢ Ijj~yUGENE Field was an insatiable |
â¢fri/<Â£ bibliomaniac. Rare books to him
â â â ^/l were a lad, and a revel in a library
where first editions awaited his caressing
touch was the poet-humorist's wildest dis
sipation. Field had few idiosyncrasies for I
. a genius, but his love of extraordinary i
books was an absorbing passion with him, !
trnddufine the time he spent in Califor- !
. nia, when he came to the coast three rears :
ago in pursuit of health, just prior to his j
death, he would come to San Francisco ]
almost daily from his home in Oakland
and spend hours nosing about the old
bookstores of the City.
Poring over an ancient tome was dissi
pation to 'Gene Field. There was no at
traction for him in modern Bohemia.
There was no enjoyment lor him in the
â¢wine cup, nor in association with revelers j
who found surcease from sorrow around
the festal board. And yet that dissipated
genius. " Edgar Allan Poe, was Field's
greatest favorite among authors.
In his artistic proclivities the humorist
was always hampered by his lack of
wealth. His inability to purchase every
'treasure from a bibliomaniac's point of
view was the bane of his life. Field never
' acquired riches, notwithstanding the fact
that he was an indefatigable worker, and
his comparative poverty caused him here
â  in San Francisco to lay aside, with a
sigh, volumes that had thrilled his biblio
. .maniac soul, and which he longed to pos
sess.
â¢ Field' told of his tribulations in this re
gard in a humorous skit which he wrote
a.lter his return from Europe in l? 90. The
first and last versej of the effusion read as

A Trip in a Treetop
Idyls of the Field.
T^Â¥yP ;n a big oak tree, where 1
I'^J^ have established a snuggery, my
*aJ') privacy was invaded to-day by a
11 ck of titmic . I wish I could do any
thing like justice to these morsels of birds,
but no words at my command can do it.
There is no feathered creature except the
humming-bird bo fearless and free in the
presence of humankind as the "least tit
mouse," and except the hummer we have
no other bird so small. But the hum
ming-bird, dear though he is to every
lover of n-ature, never seems to me to
come quite so close to the heart as does
the sober-hued, round-eyed, little crap of
quick life we call the titmouse. He has a
bigger name, a portentous title, quite as
lone as himself, but no one ever thinks of
cal.ing him by it. He is just the tit
mouse, as in the Eastern States, his
cousin, the black-capped titmouse (Parus
stracapillus) is just the chickadee, dear to
everyone who really sees him.
The titmouue is the friendliest of all the
pmall birds. You may call him close to
you by the simple process of answering
his lisping twitter as he hops among the
foliage Â«eeking insects, and as an insect
destroyer every one of them is worth
many times his tiny weight in gold.
I have ;-ai'i he is sober-hued. As a mat
ter of fact be is a most absurd appearing
little bird, with his wee body, his large
bead and big, round, astonl*hed-iooking
eyes. But he is exceedingly lovable; so
frank and confiding, so perfectly certain
that you are his friend anu glad of his so
cleiy as be seems 10 be of yours. He em
bodies in his funny little self many of the
very best of those traits we are wont to
call human. You may bring a whole flock
of tbe bird* within reach of your hand by
imitating the cry of one of them in dis
tress. They will gather about with anx
ious, solicitous chirps of inquiry, eagerly

Nearly everything printed in t!ie English
language can be found in the place, and it
was from this source 'Gene Field derived
his greatest pleasure so soon before he
went hack to Chicago to die.
The Western poet loved the place, and
he would enter the old-boot store with

nostrils distended, like a racehorse ready
to run a race.
There was one nook in the place that
Field always sought. It was the place
wnere the first editions were kept, and
once he was seated before those musty
tomes the poet became oblivious to all
surroundines. He paid no heed to the
young woman who came into the place,
and, while she chewed assiduously upon
a piece of gum, iooked over the volumes
of Bertha If. Clay, "Ouida" or "The
Duchess." He had no time to devote to
one who was looking for "Â«omething
new," nor to the cranks who affected
more recent authors than he.
Field in coming into this bookstore
made for one place and was not satisfied

! cimraJe. I once raw two titmice hover

The little fellows congregated in the
oak tree this morning were as joyous as the
; sunbeams sifting down among the leaves,
i One small hunter explored a single twip
within a yard of my hand for full five
minutes. He saw me apparently for the
i first time ns he came around from behind
| a leaf and cave a great start. Then,
with the air of one who would say, "Don't
he afraid ; I won't hurt yon," he* resumed
his search for insects. In this he was very
thorough and systematic, ciineing to a
single leaf or a little twig, sometimes on
the upper side, now below, sometimes up
right, regarding the bark with eager scru
tiny. Ajrain, head downward, watching
with intent gaze for the tinest midge to
show itself. At frequent intervals his
sharp little bill wouid make a dash, and if
after movements count foranytbing he se
cured his prey every time.
The titmice were not the only people I
met in my travels through the treetop.
Away on an outermost bough a thrush
perchad, silent and watchful, so little
afraid that he merely sprang to another
branch upon my approach. A silent bird
always seems to me the em bodimem of
mystery. I think John Burroughs some
where expresses the same thought. The
little titmice chirped incessantly. The
goldfinches, flitting everywhere, made the
air musical with their pretty calls, and
the chattering sparrows and juncos

until he reached it. This was before the
shelves that contained the old books.
"After we found out who he was," said
Miss Daly, who presides over the place,
"we never used to pay any attention to
Mr. Field. He would come and go when
he pleased and would move bis chair
about when he liked. Sometimes he
would pore for hours over one bootcs."
As the poet-humorist could not buy all
the rare editions he desired, his chiefest
ufilicht was in visiting bookstores and
libraries where he could secure access to
them.
Early editions of American authors af
forded aim his greatest pleasure. A first
edition of Joaquin Miller's poems, where
in the bard of the mountains ungrammat
ically stated â
I seen tne sun o'er Shasta's heights
pleased him particularly, but when the
price of the volume was quoted to him the
poet refused to buy it on the ground of
economy.
So it was with a firft edition of the
poem^ of Edgar Allan Poe, which was of
fered to Field for $10.
"Too much/ said the poet, as he laid
the book down with a sigh.
According to Mi-s Dalv, Field never
quibbled over prices. After "poKing
about" among the books in the store he
would generally select two or three vol
umes that he thought he wanted; but if
the price asked for any of these seemed too
much for his economic and domestic ideas
he would lay tbe volume aside with an
voices ; but none of them had the fascinat"
ing interest for mo that the thrush pos
sessed, sitting silent in the treetop. I
could have dispensed for the time with
the whole feathered chorus could I but
have heard his voice.
From my treetop I witnessed an amus
ing bit of character diÂ«play on the part of
a couple of goldfinches below. When a
goldfinch goes a-wooing he usually makes
a point of having one or two eligible
home-sites in his mind's eye, and when
other arguments fail with the lady of bis
choice he will show her there, apparently
as a last le-ort. Beneath the oak tree, in
a tangle of alder and greasewood, over
grown with poison oak and the climbing,
spreading megarrhiza, a jolly finch was
spying about in a very businesa-like
way.
His little bill kept opening and closing
rapidly as be flew back and forth, and
through the field-glass I could see his
throat quiver, bat if he made any sound I
could not hear it. He hopped along the
ground beneath the bushes and looked
critically upward, first with one eye, then
with the other. Then he flew to an over
hanging bough of the oak and looked
down upon the mass of foliage. Next he
perched upon the fence, some lit:le dis
tance away, and took a careful survey.
After that he dived into the bushes, and
I could trace his progress from twig to
twig by movements of the leaves. A.t last
he flew back to the fence and began to
sfng.
Presently another goldfinch came flut
tering along in a iretty waved line, as
this bird always flies, lie, too, wan evi
dently house-hunting, and the busby
tangle caught his eye as It had that of his
fellow-birdllng. Bat no sooner had he
alighted upon an outer branch than down
ur>on him the first goldfinch swooped,
knocking him from his perch, andlthe two
air of sorrow and, with a sigh, murmur
"Too much," and that was the end of it.
After Joaquin Miller's first erratic
poems an American edition of Carlyle's
"Past and Present," published by Charles
C. Little and James Brown in Boston in
1843, was one of 'Gene Field's favorites in
this old bookstore.
"Calyanos: a Tragedy," by George H.
Boker. published by E. H. iiutler & Co.
in Philadelphia in 1848. was another book
in which Field found particular delight.
The only comment that the Western
genius was ever known to make in regard
to a volume was a remark he made de
rogatory to some one who, in this volume,
marked the paragraph which reads:
! In the creation of ihe earth and man
I oft have wondered how omniscient God
Could take ileliglit in forming things like men.
"Why should such lines as those be em
phasized?" said Field.
Irvine's Aj:apida's "Conquest of Gran
| ada," published by Carey, Lee <fc Carey in
j Philadelphia in 1827, was another volume
iin this home of aged tomes in which
I Field found particular delight. Into this
ihe would delve for hours. Next to it was
J an edition of Lon^feilow's "Hiawatha,"
i published by Tickuor & Fields in New
York in 1855, in whose contemplation
Field spent many hours.
Probably the most unique boot that
attracted Field's attention during his visit
to San Francisco just Drior to his death
was a nondescript volume entitled "Phu
ri-bus-fah, a song without an author and
& deed without a name," written under
the nora de plume of l'hilander Doesticks,
P. 8., and published by Livermore & Rudd
in New York in 1850.
Over these rare books 'Gene Field would
dwell for hours. To him, during those
last days of his life, they were a source of
daily pleasure; except for his wife and
his children they were the greatest source
of pleasure to th? Western poet who
wrote the lullabies of a naiion and sung
children to sleep.
disappeared, m&king feints at each other
in the air as they flew.
Pedauogia took me to task the other
day. "There are so many practical issues
to be consideied by thoughtful minds,"
!-he !-aid, seriously. "1 wonder you can
spend so much time over dickey-birds and
weeds."
I am in perfect agreement with Peda
goeia, who is learned beyond my widest
ken. Tins is a time and an hour of prac
tical issues, treat problems to be solved,
but 1 que-tion whether there is any
greater problem than that of our relation
to the lowly things about us; any issue
more vital, more practical than that from
nature up lo nature's God. It is good to
come to know the life of the small crea
tures that live beside us. Their very ex
istence is in its way a comment upon, an
interpretation of, pur own life, with its
further reach, its wider needs and possi
bilities. Tnere is, more is the pity, a deal
ol false sentiment indulged in about the
things of nature. We who love shata
bring it to her, as we carry it elsewhere.
Nevertheless, what there is of U3 that is
simple and true may tind its best help
among the dickey-birds and the weeds, if
we come to them witli true, wholesome
apprec.aiion. The good old New England
priruor expressed a psychological prin
ciple, as well as literal truth and the al
phabet, when it taught in questionable
verge how
Zebedee

The treetop does not pierce the sky
(nothing really pierces the sKy but weather
vanes and church steeples. The vanes,
perforce, to show which way the wind

that no wind blows ill; the others for the
impaling, perhaps, of any spiritual aspi
ration that may ?uccepd in getting above
them), but it grows skyward, which is
better than being reared in that direction,
and itn growth is unhindered by "pride
and vainglory and all the other burdens
of life." We may learn a lesson in good
ness from it ; in tafcing what comas in the
order of life, not striving after more, or
other, or different things, for good cometh
not of strife.
But while nature will surely help us to
clearer ana simpler seeing if wo turn to
her in loving honesty, her lesson is one'of
first principles rather than of polity. They
make a mistake who reason from the life

no real lesson in tne ordering of our lives,
for we have their life plus humanity, with

power of choice. Perhaps, after all, the
only lesion nature has to teach us is that
of love, which we learn as we briiiÃ to her
the perception of beauty, but this lesson is
a supreme one, for love is, in fact, the
problem of life and its solution.

Portrait of a Lone Miner in His Cabin

That Is JMeariy Extinct
iI^^BOUT forty years ago there was
.â¢-liav-v streaming into the newly discov
jl\*v ere( * gold fields of California a
steady current of immigration. Nearly
all the new-comers were men, and young
men too. with habits not yet firmly fixed.
They were "going home," you know, as
soon as they had filled their respectable
Eastern carpetbags with nuggets â yes,
"as soon."
They didn't go. Let the magic of tne
Western air pet into their blood and never
again would the effete civilization of tne
East satisfy. They wouldn't have gone
with a whole regiment of carpetbags full
of nuggets. If California was a great
plsce to make money how doubly great
and glorious a place it was to spend it!
And their habits were soon "fixed" too.
A sad fix sometimes, and always a fix
that never could be unfixed, and that
never was so well fixed as in California
the glorious, the golden, the flowery.
Monammed came to the mountain, as was
inevitable; and Mohammed, in the shape
of wives, sisters and mothers, found the
mountain quite a bearable place, inso
much that they, too, became totally unfit
to live outs-ide its shadow.
Before the advent of womankind there
had sprung up, like some widespread vari
ety of toadstool, the miner's cabin. Men
lived in companies, in pairs, or all by
their lonelys, and "batched." A collec
tion of models of the cabins of the Vw'a

Theyâ the cabinsâ ranged from spotless
to very spotty indeed, and from handy to

I bmndicess; from picturesquely pretty to
! picturesquely hideous. Almost the same
description would apply to the miners
themselves, who have been drawnâ and
quarteredâ so variously in novels written

ways amuses me. It reminds me of the
habit country folk have of consulting
Ayer's Almanac for to-morrow's weather.
They have firm faith the "cloudy" fits the
whole face of the earth like a garment,
and that the prophecy "rain" opens Hood
gates upon all the world.
We have been assured that Bret Harte's
miners are like Cooper's Indians, "an ex
tinct race that never existed"; but we
can't help thinking Ihem line fellows, and
so they are, or were, and so were the
"truly" miners. Tney were of sundry and
divers kinds those real miners I grew
among, but tliey were men whose like is
not looked upon every day.
When the feminine element came it was
wond-rful how the cabins bloomed. Some
broke out into tumor-like wings and lean
tos and some disappeared entirely, fright
ened at the array of white curtains and
polished teakettles, overalls ceased to be
adorned with patches of sacking, and flan
' nel shirts had buttons on. Evolution had

Thus some of the lone dwellers in cabins.
Their habits had, indeed, become fixed,

As I look upon those I have known all

How can men, gregarious animals as

they labor on aloneâ such a drear word.

all very well to call the world bad and well

j him when he takes himself. And, be
sides, the ione miner doesn't hate the
world; he has just become used to being
alone. He pans out his little hoard, cuts
his wooJ, fries his bacon and smokes.
When he goes to town he goes and comes
with no unnecessary delay. Silence and
the cabin have become indrspensable.

periods and get drunk. Some of him
walk each day to the office to get papers,
to keep in touch wfth the world they
never touch. Some ot him, live in pairs

I never see the face of man except twice a

on the brow of all.
One of the genus â dead now â lived
alone except when some friend of long

; blue shirt and rubber boots, could take nis
! pipe out of his mouth and roll forth Greek
verse, pure and true, like martial 'music.
He knew what it meant, too. All the
classics were stored in his bottomless
memory, and I believe he dreamed in
Latin. He loved the admiration of his
friends, but he died up there alone and
his dog came down to tell it.
Another sat in his hovel after his work
was done, a poor, bent, twisted old fellow,
| and raw spirits. His wife of years agoue

: spoke tender words from the spirit world
and he was happy. We all see spirits of
I the past sometimes. Perhaps if we livea
: alone and thotignt constantly of the loved
; ones we would shape for ourselves a few
homemade angels, too.
I knew one, and know him yet, whom
Bret Harte might have immortalized for
his half-drunken speech. (Then could
the critics have proved lie never existed?
Even so.) When be tells me he saw "the
time previous before the next to the last"
he was in town, and goes on tangling him

I prised to hear him say "which the same."
There is another who loves only his
j dog. I wonder what sad twist came in
j his life to make him hata a woman and
j idolize a crop-eared cnr. It sleeps in his

seat and is out of place generally. The
man is cruel and sour to his fellow-man.
Something did it ; something makes him

"I f uess he wouldn't be any deader if he
had lived like folks," a boy remarked of
one. The boy was puzzlM and felt, with
out understanding, the difference between
that funeral and others. The absence of
grief was sadaer than its presence would
have been.
No, he wouldn't be any deader â he
wouldn't be so dead if he lived in any

Traveling among the mountains over
the seldom used trails one meets the an-,

the store. He is getting old ever. so fast
and totters beneath his pack, but you will
tind his ideas young enough if you like to
dismount and walk with him a ra;le or
two. He lives only in the past, so bis heart
never grows old. You will find him a
sociable fellow, especially if in that pres
ent-past of his. He "knew your'fath >r."

Ten years from now a specimen of the
genus will be a curiosity indeed, and
many, many a tale of romance, of pathos,
of iragedy will bury itself in an un
marked grave. In a far-away home there
may be a tale, a tradition of a young man
who went west to conquer fortune, and
may be there will be a lingering hope of
the return of a rich rolative someday;
and in the solitude of the hills there will
be a rude stone and mud tireplace stand

J\ Quaint Bird Legend.
The Medical Press, in a recent reference
to a work on some old legends in connec
tion with drugs, said: "It would be inter
esting to know if the bind whicii the
author calls 'aster' is known by modern
ornithologists. Speaking of ithe remarks
that its scent is said to be so strong that
fishes are drawn by it as he is flying over
the river, and so taken up by him, having
one leg like a hawk, theother like aduck."
It is not difficult, however, to identify the
bird in question, says the Westminster '
Gazette. It is the osprey (Pandion halite
tus), which, although not to-day classine'd
under the genus astur, is related to it. 'In
the Rev. C. Swainson's "Folk-Lore of
British Birds" there is a reference to it
from Shakespeare. "Coriolanus," act
four, scene three:
A v fid i us, log. : As in the osprey of the fish,
Who takes it
By sovereignty or nature.
And in Peele's play called "The Battle of
Alcazar" (1594), act ii, scene 1:
I will provide thee with a princely osprey,
That, as she flieth over fish In pools.
The fish shall turn their bellies up.
And thou shait take thy liberal choice or all.
We learn aUo from Mr. Swainson's book
that "an old belief" is mentioned by Har
rison in his "Description of Britain," pre
fixed to Holinshed's "Chronicle" (vol. I,
pace 352), who writes respecting the
osprey: "It hath not been ruy hap
hitherto to Fee anie of these foules, and
partlie through mine owne negligence;
but I heare that it hath one foot like a*
hawke to catch withall, and another re
sembling a goose, wherewith to swim;
but whether it be so or not I refer the
further search and trial thereof to some
other." Giraldus Carnbrensis ("Topog
raphy of Ireland," page 3S, cd. Writ;lH)
improves on this moralizing as follows:
"In like manner the old enemy of man
kind fixes his keen eyes on us, However
we may try to conceal ourselves in the
troublesome waves of the present world,
and ingratiating himself with us by tem
poral prosperity, which may be compared
to the peaceable foot, the cruel sDoiler then
puts forth his ravenous claws to clutch
miserable souh and drag them to perdi
tion."
Thefoodof the swallow is composed of
insects alone, and the number these birds
destroy in a single summer is incalcula
ble. They are in summer on the wing for
fully sixteen honrs during the day, and
the greater part of the time making havoc
among the millions of insects which infest
the air.

The 1 Brooklyn Citizen of February 12 says:
The Brooklyn Women's Wnist Association ;
had as its guest of honor on Wednesday morn- '
ing, at the Germania Club, P. J. Tormey of San
Francisco, director of the American Whist
B. Tlie interesting feature ol his visit
was Uie opinion he expressed regarding
woman's relation to the modern game. After
reating his own experiences as a student of
{lie game from the ume when he was an in
different player, with only luck ns his mascot,
he spoke quite 'at length of the live interest
women of the West, ru<l especially of San
-Francisco, are now taking in whist. "They
"are becoming very fine players," said Mr. Tor
mey. "Why? Because tney are willing to
study long and carefully. Were I choosing
â¢ peopje for a tournament I would select fifty
women' to play against fifty men, and feel
pr>".v certain thai the former would win.
'Tthink it is a very great accomplishment
for a woman to play an expert game of whist,
and I believe further that it should be pait of
a 'girl's education. I should like to see it
taught in our universities and hope at some
time it will be introduced into tiie private
schools of .San Franci-sco."
Mr. Tormey congratulated the Brooklyn
Club upon its succcsmul organization, and its
â¢unusually large membership for its age. He
then took for a partner Mrs. Wade, one of the
* experts of the cub, and played ttie game with
her, intimidating some opponent and inspir
ing others, as he progressed from table to
table. At the conclusion of the game he said
the club numbered several fine players.
Mr. Tormey has probably done more to
. arouse interest in whisi and instigate the
scientific study of the game through the
organization of the American Whist League
than any other man m this country. Many
clubs on the Pacific Coast owe their origin
directly or indirectly to him. Being a "vrhist
crank," as he te'ras himself, he go?s about the
country, attending all the important tourna
ments and meets, gaininc the latest develop
ment of whist study, as well as diffusing his
own knowledge of the game.
The Brooklyn Women's Club was organized
about five weeks ago, with Mrs. E. V. Baker,
vile of the secretary oi ihe Men's Whist Club,
as president. Meetings are held on Wednes
day mornings in the Germsnia Club house,
and the average attendance is forty.
Women Whist-pi avjers.
Vogue, in one of its issues in January, has
one of the finest illustrations of whist-players
ever published, mid to odd to the charm they
are r!1 w.omen. Having had the pleasure of
meeting them all and playing whist with most
of them, we can speak by the card if we say a
few words in their praise. A few years ago 'we
were laughed at by some at that time high in
authority in whist circles lor even sug
gesting that women had rights in
whist clubs. Our whist clubs in San
Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Petaluma
and other cities In our State would
not be self-sustaining wltnout the women.

Â» a team, sacn as St. Paul, for example, which
I has In its membership a whist writer of
ability, who airs all the plays and theories of
i his team in print, is placed at somewhat of a
I disadvantage. Fortunately, however, there is
a method by which the situation may, with
j out great difficulty, be somewhat relieved in
I the near future.
If the committee on systems of play ap
pointed by the league makes a report which
is adopted by the league, we will then have
an A. W. L. system. We do not expect that
this action will cause any team to deviate in any
appreciable degree from its preconceived no
tion of what is and what is not trick-winning
play, and we do not believe that the good of
the game would be enhanced by such a course,
as the necessary result of a unanimous follow
ing of one system would be lack of advance
ment, but we do believe that the league
system could be used as a standard for the
adoption of a rule that any team about to par
ticipate in a challenge match should, a cer
tain designated length of time prior to the
match, inform its opponent in wnat respect
or respects its system differed from that
adopted by the league.

CLUB GATHERINGS
Fashionable Organizations Enter
tain Their Friends.
The Music Teachers' Association of Califor
nia gave its twenty-second concert In Kohler
<fc Chase Hall on Wednesday evening, Febru
ary 24.
The entertainment was opened by the presi
dent, V. A. H. Hoffmeyer, who gave Â«n address
on piano schools from the time of Bach,
Trick 1. East figure* that his partner hflg
king and queen, and may let him discard the
queen of spades.
Trick 4. North knows he is leading up to a
probable ten-ace, but he figures East to have
another trump of which he must be deprived.
Trick 6. West is able to shut North out with
the seven and draws his six, and Eusc makes
the situation of the club Buit clear by discard
ing the ace. The rest Is easy.
What Is the f roper Lead?
Reno, Nev.. January 29, 1897.
Whist Editor Call .- Will you kindly indicate
the proper lead from this handâ that is, the
one most likely to make tricks, all things con
sidered: Jack of Spades turned by East; South
to lead and holds:
Spadesâ 6.
Heart*â A, X, 3, 2.
Clurs-A, J. 8, 4.
Diamon isâ A, 7, 64.
Without any hesitation we should say the
best trick-winning lead is tho king oi hearts.
We know of a good many who play at the
game who would jump at the opportunity of
leading the lone trump, but we think sound
whist play is to lead the king of hearts and
wait developments.
â  Rubbers " Versus Qames.
In England whist-players speak of playing a
"rubber." which means the best two out
of three 5 -point games. "Honors" are
also counted. If one side happens to have
the four "honors" dealt them they Â»core four.
8o it is easily seen that in the English game
luck is a great factor. For many years we
never played whist without counting honors;
but Â«he formation of the American Whist
League, with its code of laws, wiped honors
out and madethe game consist of seven points.
This game of seven points without honors was
first played In one of the leading whist clubs
of Paiis in 1843. The great Deschapelles was
the father of it
Solitaire Whist

Fined and Go to Prison
a Year.
A strange and interesting story has
reached here from rv mote Circle City, on
the Yukon River, showing bow the min
ers there stoutly champion the cause
|of the ladies against all comer.- 1 . If. is
j sometimes hard on some of the sterner
! sex, bui they arc supposed to be able to
.' stand it.
Not long since Thoraa9 Ashby, a young
' man prominently connected with a lead
j ing Southern family, and who, with his
j brother, Oscar Ashby, recently la San
! Francisco, had been for several years on
the Yukon, was courting Miss Mary-
Andrews of Circle City. Miss Andrews is
young and highly regarded on the Yukon.
SbÂ«> has some Russian and Indian blood,
and is described as being a brunette wi.h
a very fair complexion, regular features,
and hau<l3ome withaL
Sne lived for some time In the family of
George T. Baldwin, who had charge of
the Yukon exhibit at the Mi iwinter Fair,
when he was at the head o: the Alaska
Trading Company's atoie at Circle City.
Everybody along that part of the river
was acquuinU'd with her, and it is said
that at least 100 miners stood ready to
propose to her.
But as Ashby had begun the courting
ahead of them they let him have the right
ol way. Alter some two years of courting,
however, Ashby's love began singularly to
wane. He had announced that he was
eoing to marry the young lady, and as it
seeaiea generally known, Miss Andrews
began to be wrought up over his coolness.
As he did not come around any more
she stated her case to the miners, who as
a body constitute the high c 'urt which
settles ail questions on thfi Yukon. They
were not a oit slow in acting on her case.
Hastily summoning the tardy Jover, nnd
rinding that he tacitly admitted all the
facts as s:ated by Miss Andrews, they
made up two verdicts, either of which he
cou'd take as his choice.
One was to immediately par the girl
$SCO in cash, and at the same time marry
her. The other was to ray a line of $2uoo
and be imprisoned ior one year.
There is no jail in Circle* City, but the
miners proposed to make one for the spe
cial use aforesaid. However, Ashby. when
confronted with the two verdicts, imme
diately accepted the former and married
the youne woman.
"Did the miners make him put up
the $500, too?" said a well-known
Yukon miner yesterday, after he had re
counted the story. â¢'You bet they d\\.
Oh, yes ; when they decided he had "to do
this, he had to. There was no way out of
it. But I suppose that though he gave it
to her Â«he afterward slipped it back to
him. You know you can't entirely regu
late a thins: like that."MINES
& MINERS
fIP^HE new State Mineralogist, A. S. Cooper
%â â  \ -ââ  Of Santa Barbara, will step into J. J.
j|/$ Crawford ' 3 official shoes on the Ist of i
the coming month and then a new ad- j
ministration of the State Mining Bureau will j
begin. Mining men are expressing a good j
many opinions of varied sorts about the wis
dom "and unwisdom the Governor displayed
by the appointment, but that comes as a mat
ter of course; and only time and Mr. Cooper
. can show what sorl of an administration will
.result.
. -The appearance of the general appropria
tion bill which is now being milled at Sacra
mento does % not at this moment promise that
the Mining Bureau will be able to fulfill any
great mission during the next two years,
under anybody's direction. The appropria
tion named is only #25,000 for the two years â I
just half what the Lureau lias had during the '
past two years. I- the amount is not increased
'by uineitdment the bureau will have a con
tracted and poverty-stricken career ahead of
1 if.- The amount of $12,500 just about pays
the "inside expenses of the bureau as at pres
ent conducted.
c This includes the salaries of the State Min
eralogist ($3000), the secretary, curator, chem
i-i eta-!., rent ($2400) and the incidental ex
jronses o.f laboratory, library, correspondence
\ajjd office work, etc. The important field
work, which is carried on by five field assist
â¢ ants, has used the balance. The iaw provides
e that a certain large proportion of the appro
priation shall be spent in field work, and with
a total of but $12,500 a year there would have ;
to be a heroic cutting down and crowding to
gether at headquarters.
â¢ The Mining Bureau is an institution which
could "undoubtedly be made of immense
'value in the wiss encouragement and assist
ants it could give to the development of the
mineral resources of the State, and since its
institution it has been of great value to the
mining.industry, though that value has varied
with tne chances of politics and the freaks of
Legislatures.- For the years 1889-90 the ap
.prpDriation was $100,000. The possibilities
of State; aid to the mining industry are strik
ingly illustrated in some of the British, colo
nies, especially those of British Columbia,
Austratia-and Xew Zealand, where the mining
departments of the State governments have
been one of the most effective causes of the
present mining development and prosperity.
"* The fostering care and the energetic assist
ance bestowed on the industry in these colo
nies contain too much paternalism for this
" country, but they illustrate the value and im
portance of governmental agencies doing
what nobody e.se can or will do for an impor
tant industry.
The Mining Bureau Is highly valued by the
â¢mining men of the State. It Is a ready and
convenient source of all manner of practical
â¢information, the-museum is visited by -10,000
,-or more people annually and its scientific in
vestigations and -publications are of very great
value. "This early stage of a great mining re
vival is not thought by mining men to be the
time to cripple the bureau into a career of
â¢ mere existence.
'- The plump of English capital Into the
Mariposa grant which was heard the other
day when the sale of Alvinza Hayward's sixth
' o interest was announced will doubtless soon
be followed dj- still more interesting develop
ments concerning this great property. It ap
pears to be the signal for the long-looked-for |
| Â°" development of the grant.
' .' The ia was not mad* to the California Ex
. .^loration Company, as the papers had it.
. Prince -Poaiatowsti's big company wa* not
. Â° concerned.-' The purchasers were Hamilton
Smith and hi, partner, Mr. Perkins, who
â¢ bought the one-sixth for 5166.666 on the basis
, of a valuation of $I.oov.i,<>oo for the entire
property. Curtis H. Lindley represented me
..purchasers in the legal phase of the transfer.
'Messrs. Smith & Perkins are the direct pur
o chasers, but'it is no: known just whose money
will be paid to Mr. Hayward. These great
. mining operators are quite able to pay it j
"themselves and- may have bought on their
, o Own account, but there is a general supposi
t? Â»a that the Exploration Company of London
Will add this to its investments.
This great syndicate, which is supposed to
number the Rothschilds among its backers,
ana which has invested nearly !?50,000,000 in
American mines a. one, has for some time
been, accused by rumor of being kindly dis
â¢ posed toward the Mariposa grant. Hamilton
Â° Smith's mining operations are mixed up with I
! Â° London syndicates in all sorts of ways, and
when he buys a property we will have to go to
\ him to find out all about it. Mr. Smith's high
*â  connection with the Exploration Company as
a director and sort of managing expert,
together With the fact tnat he has engineered
most of its biÂ£ deals, provides the supposition
â¢ o that it is the Explo.ration Company that has
Invested British gold in Mariposa County.
Smith and Perkins may keep the Interest
themselves, and they may finance the proposi
tion in various ways in London and with one
â¢ f>r several syndicates. It is not likely that
. Hamilton Smith, the Exploration Company
of London or any other English syndi
cate 'would buy a sixth interest in a big
mining property without expecting to get at
least a controlling interest, and so it is wisely
Â° c enrmised that Smith knows what other frac
tions he is going to get. These buyers are not
likely to make such an investment in a
lightly developed property with the idea
of letting the â¢ investment sleep ' a few
years, and thus it is very easy to deduce
'he probability that the Mariposa grant
_i â¢â  to be developed at last and on a
Â°T'"ge sccrle.* List fall experts conveyed more
I ' less information to Mr. Smith, and in No
Â°\?:nber and December there was a flutter of
â  expectation that the Exploration Company
was about to buy the grant and do big . things.
But Smith Teturned' to London a number of
weeks ago alter, making a big deal In Idaho,
ana did not visit California, from the first
nobody directly concerned j has given any
statements of anything but ignorance concern
â  Ing the rumored negotiations, and now no
definite information beyond the simple fact of
the sale is at large.
James Cross, president of the company and
representative of the one-sixth interest held
by the Hobart estate, eaid yesterlay: ; "Mr.
Havwarl has sold his one-sixth interest to
Hamilton Smith, but otherwise the property is
in just the condition it lias been in for a good
I while and I know nothing or the trobabilities
r.f any further transfers or of any development
icing done."
The future of the property is mainly in the
hands-Qf Senator Jones, who holds a half in
terest 'and who manages flairs. John W.
M >ckay and the Hobarl estate each owns a
sixth interest. The sale of some of these in-
t crests is expected before long. Mr. Perkins,
Hamilton Smith's partner, was, by the way,
' innnagerof flic property when it was owned
yean ego by Trenor W. Park of New. York, and
so'is wejl acquainted with it.
The grant, as is generally known, once
belonged to General .John C. Fremont, and
Â» reached the present owners through a course
01 mortgage troubles. It is a magnificent
domain in Mariposa County, embracing the
lower end of the mother lode and contains
Over 44,000 acres, or seventy square miles of
If id, well-wooded and watered, embracing fer
tile little valleys and an irregular ramifica
tion of mineral' ve*;ns. From the mineral lodes
the property derives its chief value and in
terest. The Josephine, Pine Tree and several
â  other miiles i:i various stages of development
are on the grant.
The detailed map of the grant shows several
scores of prospects where veins have been un
covered., but on which little or no . develop
ment has been done. The grant is thus
looked upon as containing great possibilities,
especially iince the recent demons of
the deep values of the mother lode, and as
one wliich would reward large investments
for development. The property hns lain so
long without any effort at development be
cause o: the inability of the owners to pull
together. Hamilton Smith' 6 takiug hold of It
looks like the beginning of business and
Mariposa County wili rejoice when it comes.
The Mining Committee of the Assembly hog
favorably reported a bill legally defining "a
miner's inch of water." This is both interest
ing and Important, for in this Slate the
minor's inch is one thing here and another
thing there, the quantity of water understood
by this unit of measurement varying with the
different districts. Most other Western States
have established the quantity by statute. A
miner's inch is the quantity of water that will
flow through an orifice of a given size at a
given pressure in a given time. The quatitity
will vary with the form of the orifice, the
thickness and shape of the walls and other
things involving friction, etc., and it will
vary with tue presrure. which depends on the
height above the orifice al which the water
stands. In this State apertures of various
forms and dimensions nre prescribed in differ
ent localities, and hence the quantity of water
varies.
The pending bill defines a miner's inch of
water to be such a quantity *s flows from an
orifice one inch square through a two-inch
plank, with still wster standing at a depth of
.six inches above the top of the oririce, such a
di^chHTKe to be not less than one and a half
cubic feet per minute, equal to twelve gal
lons. John D. MrGillivray, editor of the
Mining and Scientific Press, points out that, j
for one thing, the bill proposes to change by
law the size of a cubic foot or the capacity of |
a gallon measure, for one and a half cubic
feet of water equais 11.22075 wine gallons, j
according to the American bUr.dard. As a |
further criticism it is said:
"For the State to prescribe through what
orifice and under what couditions the water
must flow is a piece of supererogation as value
less as it would be to lay down the shape of
vessels by which gallons must be measured.
The conditions of the case must determine
how the water shall be measured. What is
wanted is a standard lor the quantity only. If
I the Legislature will state the flow per minute
that shall equal a miner's inch it will have
done its duty."
MINING PROGRESS.
The forestry division of the Department of
Agriculture is endeavoring to collect infor
mation regarding the consumption of timber
by the mines ol the country. It may be men
tioned as an interesting item suggesting the
great investment represented by mine
timbering that it has been estimated that in
the copper mines of Butte, Mont., alone
i 36,500,000 feet were used in 1895 for un
derground purposes, and that the total lor all
the Butte mines for that one year was 37,500,
--000 feet, at a cost of $1,050,000 in place. The
figures for 1896 would exceed these.
The Heleu quicksilver mine in Lake County,
better known as the American mine, lying
seven miles west of Middletown, has been
bonded by R. B. Harper and George F. David
son, who are interesting Boston capital in the
property. This valuable mine has been lying
idle ever since the furnace was destroyed by
fire some years ago.
The nold production for New Zealand for
1896 was $4,91)0,000, a decrease of a little
over 10 per cent as compared with 1895. This ]
decrease was due to unexpectedly small re- ;
turns for the last quarter of the year. New
Zealand, however, will early show a consider
able increase in production as a result of the
new activity which was fairly begun last year.
ThÂ»Â»re was a great increase in the number of
prospecting and mining licenses issued by the
Department of Mines, and during the year a
preat deal of development work was done.
Eneiish capital is goiuc into the New Zealand
fields, and the present year will see greater
development and production.
New Mexico's output of precious metals dur
ing 189*5 exceeded that of 1895 by fully 6 per
cent. From conservative figures for the pre
vious year as a basis, it appears that the Terri
tory has produced $2,999,053 in god and sil
ver dur.ug the year just closed. Figures on
the lead and copper output of the Ter
ritory for 1896 are not accessible, but
the indications arc that they will
much exceed those of 1895. which were $750,
--000. Tne Increase noted has b-.-en mainly in
the form of gold, and should be credited cliiefiy
to Grant and Sierra counties in Southwestern
New Mexico; to the Cochiti mining district,
seventy miles southwest of Santa Fe; to the
gold mines of south Santa Fe County; to the
Eizabethtown, Baldy, La Belle and Amieti

ABOUT SAILORS' RIGHTS.
Novel Point Raised in the Suit
of Silviera Against Iver
son and Others.
Are the Owners of a Vessel Liabl
for Injuries R clved by Oae
of Their Seamen ?
Judge Bahrs has another problem con
cerning "sailors' rights" to settle. The
question has arisen in the case of Sil
viera against Iverson and others, where
tbe plaintiff is an able seaman who
brought an action to recover damages
against tbe owners of a ship for personal
injuries received while on duty. He was
hauling in on a line when it parted, by
reason of being old and rotten, and Sil
viera was precipitated to the decs, break
ing his shoulder and disabling him for
life.
Attorneys- Gunnison, Bartnett and
Booth, representing tbe defendants, en
tered a demurrer, claiming that such an
action cannot be maintained in any event,
aiid moved to dismiss.
Ttiere is no statute in California touch
ing tbis question, and the action is
brought under tbe common law, t.ie pro
ceeding following tbe course laid down in
similar matters, when the subject of tbe
litigation is called tbe action on tbe case.
'lne defendants assert that under tbe
English law thera is no implied contract
us between tbe owner of a ship and a
sailor as to tbe seaworthiness of the snip
or in regard to the absence of delects in
ti.e appliances or construction of tbe rig
gine. In other words, they hold that when
a man goes aboard v ship he must take
his chances and that if he is injured the
owners of tbe vessel are not liable for dam
ages.
Attorney F. J. Caatlehnn contended
that the relation of muster and servant is
presumed in tbis cass the *ame as in any
other case where one person works for
another, and tbat if there is to be any ex
ception made because the servant is a
sailor on tbe high seas it is incumbent on
tbe deiendant to show affirmatively that
this plaintiff comes within tbat cxc ption.
Attention of tbe court was drawn to
the tact ti.at the Supreme Court of tbe
United States bas recently decided tbat a
sailor, when once engaged for a voyage, ia
practically a slave and that be cannot
abandon his employment under any cir
cumstances. Under such a rule it would
appear oppressive to compel a man to
proceed in the discbarge of duties when
ue believed there was peril to life or limu
because of defective appliances, and then
have the law step in and declare that he
could not maintain a suit for damases on
account of injuries resulting from such de
lee;ive appliances.
Mr. Castlehun explained to tbe court
that he could understand a motion to
transfer this case to the United Staters
District Court on the ground that it was
a matter for admiralty jurisdiction,
though even that motion he would tight,
because this is an action in persona. He
could not, however, see what legal bas.s
there waÂ« for thÂ« motion to dismiss.
Judge Bahrs intimated tbat he desired
additional authority on the question and
continued the case until to-morrow morn
ing for further argument.

intensely interesting.
Great blocks of ice came floating up

glorious weather during the past eight

JENNINGS' DISBARMENT.
Byron WaterY Accusation Presented
Before Judge* Seawell, Slack
and Hunt.
Judges Seawell, Hunt and Slack, sitting
in bant yesterday, listened to arguments
in regard to the application of Lawyer
Byron Waters, claims agent for the South
ern Pacific Company, to have Attorney
Cassius M. Jennings disbarred for unpro
fessional conduct.
The accusation alleges that Jennings
bargained with a younc man nanW Al.i-
I son, employed as a clerk in Mr. Waters'
j office, for the purchase of reports of the
agents of the Southern Pacific Company
upon accidents. It is aliened that these
i reports contained a complete statement of
j thocircumstances surrounding the various
I claims for damages against the com pany,
|~and indicated the nature of the liability of
j the corporation.
Jennings demurred to the complaint on
tne ground that it diJ not state facts suf
ficient to constitute a cause of action, tbe
contention being that Â»he reports were not
privileged communications and that it
would not be unprofessional to divulge
them.
Attorney Dunne urged the court to sus
tain the charge? and to exclude Jennings
from the profession of the law* Mr. Dunn
j said tha; an attorney was supposed to be
possessed of common honesty, and that it
was dishonest to try to prevail upon the
! confidential agent of an adversary to vin
| late the confidence of his employer. He
contended that the reports in the posses
sion of Mr, Waters were privileged com
munications. They had been submitted
] to him by his clients and werÂ» in the na
j ture of a statement of bis client's case.
He would be guilty ot a breach of pro
fessional conduct should he divulge the
information in bi-< possession, and any at
torney who attempted to persuade him to
divulge juc'.i information was guilty of a
similar breach. He also argued that if
the reports were not privileged they were
at least confidential, and that it was un
pro essional to negotiate with Allison for
the possession of them.
Mr. Dunne said that if Jennings were "a
hizli-toned man" he would have censured
i Allison for making the proposition to turn
to violate (he confidence of his employer.
j He would have told the young man that
he was doing wrong, and if he were of a
generous character would have forgiven
{ him and warned him not to engage in
i such a nefarious enterprise again. Jen
i nings saw fit. however, to sit down with
him and discuss the value of the reports
and agree to shnro with him the profits
I of the shady transaction.
Authorities were cited by Mr. Dunne in
| support of his position, and at the con
i c.usion of the argument the case was sub
mitted, the attorneys being allowed to
file briefs.
The average attendance at places of
public worship in England and Wales is
computed to be betw en 10,000,000 and 11,
--000,000 persons. There is a plac* ol wor
ship for every 600 individuals, taking the

of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take

the design.
The administration of deficiency will
soon give way to an administration that
will baiid up, and we shall got our build

discord there will be delay.
It is noted that at the Bradley Martin

in a recent speech L eutenant Peary
said that with $150 000, a few picked news

why he needed the Eskimos.
As it appears that some of the best ar
chitects in the Union approve the design
of our Federal building, it is possible
we may have reason to revise our judg
ment and be proud of it after ail.
It is always gratifying to The Call to
â work in harmony and cordial co-operation
with the commercial and industrial asso
ciations of the City for tbe general wel
fare. Tbat is what we are here for.
The Examiner no ionger dares to openly
oppose the construction of the Federal
building in this City, but that it desires to
fio so is shown by the fact that it yestcr
.tJay referred to the support of the work
by The Call as an exhibition of "intre
pidity." _
The current number of the California
Fruit Grntver says "the temptation to ob-

" having any other effect on England.

One of the notable features of the re

amount of descriptive literature given

to have broken the record and astonished
tne veterans.
Tne Legislature, the Supervisors, the
â  State Board of T ade, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Manufacturers' Associa
tion, the Merctiants' Association, the
Labor . Council and ail enterprising
citizens of public spirit are working
with The Call for the purpose of br ng
ing about an early beginning of the work
of-construction on the Federal building in
this City, and yet the Examiner tries to be
sarcastic about it. The yellow-dog jour
nal will never quit snarling.
WORKING TOGETHER.
It is in the highest degree gratifying to note the cordial support which has been
given to the movoment undertaken by The Call for bringing about a speedy
beginning of the work of constructing the new Federal building in this City. Thy
promptness with which the response has been given to the voice of The Call Bhows
that the people of Kan Francisco are in the right mood for work-inc together in har
mony and with energy for all purposes that tend to the general welfare.
The agitation for the new Federal buildine is now supported by the Legislature,
the Mayor and Board of Supervisors, the State Board of Trade, Chamber of Com
merce, Manufacturers' Association, Merchants' Association, the Labor Council and by
a considerable number of men of public spirit and enterprise. Such a combination
constitutes a potent force in our municipal life r.nd can hardly fail to achieve any
undertaking which it sets itself resolutely to accomplish. With such backing The
Call is sanguine of success, and can this morning almost assure the people that we
shall see the ground broken aud the long delayed work begun before the close of the
spring which dawns to-morrow.
It was a happy thought on the part of those interested in the movement to ar
range for calling a general mass-meeting to support the project on March 4. The
day which sees the inauguration of a new administration favorable to the upbuild
ing of American industry and prosperity will be a mo^t appropriate day for San
Francisco to inaugurate effective measures for the accomplishment of this upbnildinc
in our own city. The influences of the day and the consciousness of what is coing on
in Washington will add to the enthusiasm and to the vigor of those who will attend
the mass-meeting, and as a consequence we may expect the best results to flow from it.
In the past, two things have stood in ihe way of the construction of the building.
One of these was the apathy of ihe Government nt Washington, and the other was
the opposition to the project at home. Mr. \V. H. Mils, who has been a close observer
of all the proceedings in connection with the proposed work, declared in a statement
published in The Call yesterday that he wasdispo?ed o believe the lack of attention
given to the project by the official* at Washington was largely due to dissensions
among our own people here in Ssn Francisco. This opinion is shared by others of
equal authority on the subject. On the other hand, Congressman Maguire attributes
the delay to a determination on the part of the Secietary of the Treasury not to be<:in
the work auring this administration. He is supported in thi* view by Irs colleagues
of the Congressional delegation in California, and there can be no question tnat this
opinion also is well founded.
We may fairly assume therefore that the reasons why we hove failed in the past
are that we have been divided at home and that the administration has been not
merely apathetic but directly antagonistic to the work. Both theÂ«e ob'tacles to Â«nc
cess, however, have ceased to exist. There is no longer any opposition in San Fran
cisco worth noting to the beginning of the enterprise, and the administration of de
ficiency and delay is soon to give place to an administration of enterprise and pros
perity. The outlook therefore is good, and success is within our reach if we strive for
it with diligence and energy.
In a statement madp yesterday concerning the enterprise Mr. Mills said: "I
want to say this: If The Call succeeds by the agitation it has raised in securing the
construction of this building it will be an additional illustration of the already recog
nized fact that an energetic newspaper is better than a Congressman." The accuracy
of the statement can hardly be questioned. It is nevertheless true, however, that a
newspaper no more than a Congressman can achieve any great worK for the public
welfare unless cordially supported by the co-op?ration of men of public spirit and
energy. In the present case The Call has that co-operation. It is supported by
Congressmen and by every commercial and industrial association in the City, and
there can be little do ibl that success will be attained and the work on the new build
ine begun within a comparatively short time after the Republican administration of
progress and prosperity begins its work at Washington.
OUB CONSULAR SERVICE.
Prominent among the changes needed !
in Government machinery to advance
prosperity is reform in the consular str
vice. In spite of the large number of
faults corrected by the investigation be
gun last spring by the Secretary of State
with the $10,000 "put at his disposal by
Congress for that purpose and the im
provement made in the method of promo
tion by an executive order of September j
20, 1895, there remain many serious de
fects that call for a remedy by a new gen
eral law revising the system.
Although it is more than a century
since the first Consuls from this country
were commissioned, there has been only !
one general law passed looking to the im
provement of the service, and that was as
far back aÂ» 1856. This conservatism is
not due by any means to the perfection
of the old established order of things, for
again and again the evils of it have been
pointed out by capable men who have
been in the service and studied the system
thoroughly. Presidents, Secretaries of
State and committees of both houses have i
urged on Congress the necessity of mak
ing changes, but so far without result.
The defects of the present regulations
are too many to be fully elaborated, but
prominent among them is that lack of
permanency of tenure of office, which pre
vents capable and ambitious men from
seeking entry into such servi:e, and also
prevents the Government and commerce
from getting the great advantage of that
perfection in efficiency which comes from
long practice in special lines of work.
The sweeping extent to which this de
fect has done mischief is shown by the
fact that since March 3, 1&93, no less
than four-fifths of the Consuls have been
removed and replaced by new men. So
great and sudden a change from trusting
to veterans to trusting to recruits would
weaken any branch of the civil service.
No matter bow good the new appointees
may be they are sure to lack the power
that comes from training and gradually
acquired influence in the communities
where they are located. So large a pro
portion of chances is strong evidence of
using the consular offices for purposes of
political rewards, and commerce and
diplomacy have been made to suffer be
cause merit and experience have been
subordinated to favoritism.
The present system of fees is strongly
opposed by men who have given tbe sub
ject study, as also is the permission given
to Consuls to appoint agents to act under
them. This privilege creates a temptation
to transfer business from the main office
and thus put the Government to ad
ditional expense. It is argued there
shouid be paid salaries adequate to induce
men of considerable capacity to engage in
consular work as n permanent career, and
make strong efforts to acquire knowledge
that would therein be of lifetime use to
them. Some years ago it was asserted on
the floor of the Senate that not one-tenth
of the Consuls were properly familiar with
the language, law*, geography and ma
terial resources of the countries to which
they were sent. As the same laws govern
the system now as then, it is reasonable to
suppose that much tne same inadequacy
exists at the present time.
We may confidently look for a great im
provement in the service rendered by this
department as a result of the incoming ot
tiie new administration, for Mclvinley is
pledged to select men capable of extend
ine the usefulness of our consular service.
If Congress will also do its part by enact
ing a good general law coverine the de
lects that seem admitted by the best

When it was announced that Heitield,

will be a c:iange of opinion. It is better
to talk than to saw wood in that way.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 189 T.
THE SALISBURY POLICY.
< In his address in the House of Lords on
Thursday, Lord Salisbury made a state
ment of the policy which his Government
would aim to carry out in dealing with
the Cretan crisis. He declared that Eng
land would endeavor to induce the allied
powers of Europe to establish the admin
istrative autonomy of Crete, to continue
i it as a pait of the Turkish empire, and to
I require the Greek troops to evacuate the
island; u^-ing force if necessary. A similar
statement was made by Balfour in the
Commons, but in both houses discussion
was postponed !n order to give time for a
| full consideration of the policy prorosed.
It is hardly likely the plan outlined will
be received with much favor by the friends
of Greece, or by those who desire to see a
speedy settlement of the long vexed Turk
ish problem. The Salisbury policy is
clearly a temporary expedient. Its only
effect would be to put Crete in an anomal
ous position, which would sooner or later
lead to new complications. It is a policy
of evasion and nothing more. Its adop
j lion might postpone war for a time, but
would not remove any of the causes of
war. The old trouble would be sure to
b.-^ak out again and perhaps with even
greater violence than at present.
The Cretan people do not desire
autonomy under the Turkish Government.
They do not even desira independence.
That for which they seeK is a complete
unity with Greece as a part of the Greek
nation. Their desire springs from a
patriotic impulse exactly similar to that
which impelled the Italians to make a
united Italy and the Germans to create a
Gtrman empire. To people who are
moved by this national spirit the
offer of nothing more than a right
to regulate petty details of civil adminis
tration is almost an insult. To enforce
such a settlement upon them would simply
be to aggravate tne existing evils and to
rouse them to a deeper indignation against
the Turks. The .rritation they would feel
under the proposed government wouM
prompt them to further outbreaks, and
the result would be incessant disturbances
in the island and a never ending feud
between the Greek and Moslem popula
tion.
The most important feature of the whole
policy is the disclosure it makes of the
fact tbat the Turkish Government has
beÂ«n virtually eliminated from European
politic^. Lord Salisbury it will be seen
recognizes Turkey as an empire, but ig
nores it as a Government. It is still to
include Crete within its territory, but it is
not to rule the island or to make laws for
the people. Virtually, therefore, we have
come to the end of Ottoman rule. The
empire seems to have passed unaer the
control of the allied nations, and the only
issue which now remains to be solved is
what shall be done with the Turks as a
race, since their Government has ceased
to bÂ» a power worth considering as a fac
tor in the problem of settling the troubles
of the Levant.
TEE COBURG FAKE.
More than half the best newspaper fun
in these days consists in exposing the
fakes of the "yellow-dog" journals. There
! was a time when these fakes aroused in
! dienation, but now they have become so
I rank and their publication is so clearly
j "sheer idiocy," as Senator Sherman said
of the Exaviiner's reported interview with
him, that they excite only laughter
Every genuine newspaper in the country
has joined in tbe sport of hunting the
| fakes to death, and some of the exposures
are as amazing as anything ever shown by
the cathode ray.
One of the best revelations of the impu
dence of the yellow-dog stories has jist
been made in the exposure of the false
ness of tho Coburg fake. It will be re
membered tuat not long ago the sensa
tional journals announced to their scan
dal-loving readers tbiu the Princes of
Coburg had left her husband on account
of bad treatment and had run away with
an Austrian officer.
Following this announcement came pic
ture* of the Princess, her husband ana the
gay l.eutenant with whom she haa fled.
Then there was a *tory of a duel between
the husband and tha paramour, accom
panied by more pictures and by signed
statements from the principals.
An investigation into this sensational
scandal was ?et on foot by newspapers
that merit the name by printing news and
not fake?. The result of the investigation
is the official announcement that Prince
Coburg has all ihis time been living
quietly with bis wife at Vienua, and that
neither he nor the Princess know any
thing about the scandal at all. It. is
hardly worth while to inquire into the
origin of the story. Different theories on
the subject will b< heid in different cities.
In San Francisco the opinion will prevail
that it was started by a midnight dispatch
from the Emperor of China to Li Yung
Yuen.
SHERMAN ON CUBA.
The most notable feature of the debate
in the Senate ou Thursday on the joint
resolution in reference to tbe case of Julio
Sanguilly was the speech made by Senator
Sherman. It was the first decided utterance
of the Senator on the Cuban question since
it has been known thnt he is to be Secre
tary of State in the McKinley administra
tion, and is therefore interesting as a
declaration of the policy he is likely to
pursue in the State i ffice.
The speech of the Senator was short,
but it was ter.-e and emphatic Speaking
of the case of Sanguilly, he said: "I be
lieve that a gross injustice has been done
to a citizen of the United Siates, who has
a right t<> protection from the President."
This statement makes it clear that the in
coming Secretary takes quite a different
view from that of tbe present Secretary.
Where Mr. Olney sees nothing that calls
lor intervention on the part of our Gov
ernment, Senator Sherman sees a just
claim to the right of all the protection
which the United States can give.
The debate on the Sanguilly case was to
a large .stunt a waste of energy, inas
much as at the very time the Senate wus
demanding protection for t tie prisoner hiÂ«
pardon had already been conceded ana
issued by the Spanish Government. Sen
ator Sherman's statements, v wever, went
beyond the particular case . ider debate.
He spoke of the whole subject broadly,
and said:
I trust the time will never come when an
American citizen can be wronged or perse
cuted by any power great or small. That is
the way I feel now. lam in favor of protect
ing this American citizen, though he may be
only a naturalized citizen. I am opposed to
wrong and violence and tyranny wherever it
is ( xercised, and when it is exercised against
an American citizen I will stand up for him
even if 1 stand alone.
These words come most gratefully to
the cars of the American people. They
give utterance to a stronpr patriotic senti
ment without violating the conventional
language of diplomacy. They are offen
sive to no power on earth, and in no way
conipromi-e the incoming administration.
Nevertheless they are an emphatic decla
ration of a policy such as this country de
sires and which has been denied by the
Cleveland Cabinet. They give assur
ance to the people that we are to have
under President McKinley a true Ameri
canisrnÂ»both at home and abroad ; that the
word "protection" shall mean security of
the life and the liberty o. American citi
zens in foreign lands, as well as to indus
try and prosperity at home.
It is gratifying to Hie public mind that
the incoming Secretary should have taken
occasion to speak as he dil. What he
said will have ue effect both at home and
in foreign lands. It will encourage the
patriotic spirit of America, and give warn
ing not only to Spain but to all other na
tions of what is to be expected from our
Government when McKinley is President
and Sherman Secretary of State.

AN AMERICAN MLI-AKY POLICY
The brilliant victories of the French armies
during the republic and empire put France
foremost among the military nations of the
world, a position she easily bept for full half
a century. French uniforms and French
methods were standard the world over and
but little attention was paid to German mili
tary ideas. Yet all this while Germany, burn-
Ing to avenge former insults, was quietly
working out the military problem on lines of
her own. The result is well known. In a few
months France we* overrun and tho smaii
remnant of her army shut up in Sedan. The
fall ol Paris was the final catastrophe.
Tne natural result was that German military
ideas, organization, term of service, etc., were
eagerly copied by other nations. The whole
world seemed suddenly to have adopted the
German helmet.
From all appearances, a reaction against
"the art of war as innde in Germany" has set
in â a reaction against the Indiscriminate
adoption of everything German. We .in
America have by no means escaped the infec
tion. Germany has taught the world how to
organize modern armies, and so has made
other nations her pupils; but th? conditions
here and in Europe are so unlike that because
a tiling is good for Germany may be the best
of reasons for not adopting it here.
It is interesting 10 note that in recent years
our own Civil War 1b beginning to be carelully
studied by foreign military experts, and
equally interesting to know that away back
thirty years ago we developed a mode of fight
ing in open order which isoulyat present
finding its full recognition in the textbooks,
after having been imported from Europe.
The military lessons of the Civil War need
to be thought out and applied by Americans.
However much may be learned by a study of
foreign military methods, the fact remalus
that aside from material questions, our best
guide is our experience gained in civilized
and savage warfare. The history of our suc
cesses and failures, of victories and defeats,
but above all of the latter, contain the germs
of a distinctively American military policy.
It is finally seriously proposed to level the
present interior line of fortilicauons surround
ing Paris, the enceinte, as it is called, and
construct a new line further out.
The present works were finished in 1848 at a
cost ol $10,000,000. and consist of an enceinte
of the baÂ«;ioned type, thirty lect high and
nearly twenty-tnrec miles in length. This is
supplemented by fifteen detached forts placed
at distances varying from 1400 to 3300 meters
from tlie enceinte. The entire syÂ«.tem re
quires a garrison of nearly 50,000 men.
In 1870 came the Franco-German war and
the ea*y capture of Paris. That Paris fell in
spite of its fortifications only emphasized the
fact of ihn great Increase in the power and
ran?e of arti'lery, and also that It is useless to
trust in forts without a proper garrison to
man them. If Paris had been fcrtined in 1814
it is very probable that the allies would not
htve taken it. Napoleon, however, always
trusted to his active army and neglected to
fortify his capital.
Modern Paris is an example of a vast "in
trenched camp," the perimeter of which will
be about ninety miles when all of the proposed
detached forts are completed. In the new
changes the much-mooted question of the
value of the inner continuous line or'-en
ciente" comes up again and the solu'.inn wilt
be watched with a great deal of interest by
military engineers the world over. In most
cases the enciento consists of the old fortifica
tions built befora the advent of the moaern
artillery. With increased power of artillery
these detached works have come to be placed
further and further ou', with the object of
placing the city beyond the reach of bombard
ment. It is tnus at this outer line of works
that the battle for the possession of the city
must be decided, and once mis outer line falls
it is urged that in the resulting confusion the
enciente will awail little to stop the entry of
the victorious enemy. It the enciente iÂ» of no
use then it is better to do away with it once
for all, for it is a hindrance to the growth of
the city.

by Mrs. Crocker at great expense during
her tours in Europe.
The beauty of the rooms was accentu
ated by the floral decorations. Antique
vases were hlled with huce whiie iiiies,
wreaths were hung on statues of bronze
and marblo, and bouquets abounded
everywhere. California violets were on
sale in the library, and a table|was loaded
heavily with fragrant flowers.

." Jf^Vj a good novel and an accurate ac
count of some of the principal in
â  cidents cf the great Sepoy mutiny by one who
has Studied botn ii and Indian character
while living in that country and having op
â¢ portunities :o converse with actors on both
sides of the struggle. This is the first histori
cal novel that has been written cased on the
terrible events of that fanatical uprising, and
it is exceedingly well none. In reading it one
can scarcely tell whether he is most absorbed
in th literary irt with which the historic
events are related or in the study of the ficti
tious characters which the author has to
closely interwoven with exciting incidents of
real life. lE3HI
T-he author assu.res us .that while the book is
a commingling of tact and fiction, sha has not
allowed the fiction to interfere in the least
with the strict accuracy of her facts. She has
been scrupulously exact even to the date, tie
'. hour, the scene, and the very weather, as to
the historical part. The real actors in the
tragic event whom she introduces into the
â  o story are not allowed to say any thirg which is
rot shown correct by the reports of eye-wit
nesses, or by. their own writings. Some of the
leading incidents of the fictitious part are so
similar to what really happened that they can
not be regarded as incredible.
â¢ The. somewhat puzzling title of the story is
explained by telling that when the natives
\ are asked the" .cause of the mutiny their usual
answer is: '-God knows. He sent a breath
into the world." This suggested the words in
Genesis that were chosen as a title lor the
book.
The historical part of the story is restricted
almost entirely to the events ti.at took place
in ami c.ose around Delhi. The rush ot the
mutineers to that cny, its abandonment by
the English, and subsequent siege and cap
ture, are a.l elaborately dejcibed, wh:le our
interest in the events is greatly intensified by
the author having roused our sympathies for
tne personalities of those who are taking an
aCuve part ia the events. The pilace o: : ri 3
great M<--ghul .in Delhi, who for a few short
weeks was imagined by his courtiers to be the
Emperor of India, is qultÂ« a feature of the
book, and is the reiu.i of careful itndy of
wnat.was the actual condition of affairs in
thy brief dresm of ancestral power restored.
The story of the hercic defenge of the powder
magazine by the nine Englishmen who had it
: Lharge, and of how they resolved to blow
1: up and did blow it up rather than let the
mutineers get possession of it, is told in a wÂ»y
to send thrills of admiration through the
ve:ns. The writer eloquently re ates bow
through all the many military blunders o:
that terrjble lesson of mistakes that brought
â  on the mutiny, and then tailed to suppress it
promptly, ;he creat treasure of personal cour
age was never lost. At the end of the story
6he does indeed severely stricture the soldiers
â who refused to obey when commanded to fol
low their officers to the atorrains of the Burn

way into Delhi, but she lays the blame of thl?

town.
are we- made to see and feel
both sides of the quesrion of the awiul mu'.iny
that we can scarce y blame either the Sepoys
for rising in rebellion or the Englishmen for
their stern revenge. Feeling as the natives
must have felt when they were inarched out
to watch the shackles being riveted on the
eighty-five of their comrades \vno had been
condemned by conrt-mariial to ten years'
penal servitude mere.y because they refused
to obey an order that was to them the same as
becoming defiled and apostate, it would rather
seem to us low that tney would have been
base not to have risen in revolt agains: such
stupid tyranny. But afier the deed was done,
acd their savage natures had led them Into
outrages against women and children, the ter
rible retaliation of the Engl:shmen was as in
evitable and natural as the outbreak of the
Indians. The obstinate stupidity of the Brit-
ish officers in forcing the needless issue upon a
rece who could not be expected to understand
the matter from a .European point of view is
brought.out la a way so strong as to serve for
a -on for all time against petty tyranny.
â¢ Mrs. Steel makes us feel With the Sepoys that
Sense of. outrage and meaningless oppression
that the silent and' sullen ranks of Hitherto
faithful soldiers had fairly preised into their
souls as they stood there watching and listen
â  ing as the rivets were cinched in the shackles
of one after another of their race and brotners
Inarms whose sole offense was th-: refusal to
submit to degradation. The conflict that was
going on in the mind* of many of those dark
men between their love for their officers and
the'ineradicable instincts of their race is por
trayed in a way to rouse oar sympathies for
the painful dilemma forced upon the Sepoys.
That 'the representatives of a great, enlight
ened and Christian nation should have left
them no escape from what to them was such a
terrible choice between two evils is one of the
â  tnbst astonishing blindnesses modern history
. records.
" Alter describing how this outrage has made
" the Sepoys. ripe for rebellion Mrs. Steel's story
attributes the actual outbreak of that mur
derous war to some taunting words that fell
fromja. harlot's lips. A troop of native cavalry
were loitering through the haunts of dissipa
tion in the town of Meerut. A young and dis
â  solute, soldier had his advances met by the
jeering reply of a girl: 'We of the bazaar kiss
no cowards." Balked in his passion he left
her with an oath, and dashing into the street
raised the cry to rescue their Sepoy comrades
from the Jail. The cry was quickly responded
to and the prisoners freed. The next cry
raised was "On to Delhi!" and the great revolt
followed as swiftly from the girl's words as if
r some great prophet or chieftain nan given the
command to march and fight. "The word had
been- spoken. Nothing so very soul-stirring
Â° after aIL No consideration of caste or re
ligion, patriotism or smbiilon. Only a taunt
from a pair of painted lips."
In tb'e fiction part of the story there is a
. Major â brutal, dishonorable, unworthy
of a pure woman's love. His wife, Kate
Erlton, is it-fined, religions, noble-minded.
She does not love her husband, but lives with
him- and tries to save him from public dl.Â«
.honor for the sake of their son. Er. ton fulls
in love with Mrs. Gissing, who has a husband,
'coarse, indifferent to his wife's doings, and
absorbed in unscrupulous commercial pursuits.
Ehe has troops of admirers ana goes in fora
pay time. Erltoii's attentions to her becoma
an open scandal. He plans to run away with
Alice Gissing. While he is pondering the
question of deserting his wife this thought
brlugs decision: "I will stick to little Allle.
Who never makes a man feel like a fool or a
brute." -The elopement is prevented by the
o sudden death of Alice Gissing while perform
ing an act of dating heroism. Some of the
fine work of the author is done In gradually
bringing out many contrasting points in the
character of these two women, who had oppor
tunities to gave and spoil the same man. We
are compelled to recognize that Kat3 Erlton,
with all her virtues, has serious faults, and that
â¬ Alice Gissing, with all her faults, has the ad
mirable virtues of generosity, unselfishness,
courage and much common sense.
Toward the end Kate Elton begins to pon
der over the query why she had failed to make
her husband a better man. when the fact was
plain that Alice Gissinc hud accomplished
â ucn Â»n Improvement in him. Mrs. Steel is
strong in this art of making us feel what a
mixture human nature i- Of base and noble
traits, Bhe decs not sharp y divide people
into villains and saint?. Even Erlton is made
to display some :iob!e impulses before the end
of the sle?e of Pe.hi.
There is a strange story in the book of the
platonio love of a you: g Indian Prince for a
native woman of noble birth, which the author
says is founded on fact. The Princess is a
widow who :s not free to n-.arry again. The
Prince is recklc-^y lissolute. bat his fascina
tion for this woman sways him strongly.
One night the Princess hints that her love
for him might make her weak. He lightly
leaves her then, saying that the love of the
kissing a:id carÂ».-s.-i::g kind was too common to
be cared for. The illusion ill destroyed and
the charm gone. The woman turns away to
weep and the man goes eayly down the stairs
singing a love song.
The book is sure to interest. It has some
faults of obscurity occasionally, and in some
: parti seems 100 strung-out, but the work has
sterling merits that more than compensate for
its faults.

Mr. Bates, ;el is a story In this little book
that does indeed give marvelous evidence
of spirit life and the wandering ol
souls freed from the body about the ea.th. It
relates that three boys went to sea about the
same time, the eldest taking a ship for Bom
bay and the two younger boarding one bound
for New Orleans. Before parting the eldest,
who bad a great attachment for the youngest
of the three, peed around the neck of his
comrade an Agnus Dei, which is a Catholic
emblem commemorative of the Lamb of God.
It contained a picture of the Madonna and the

Dnrinpa terrific storm while on his return
voyage the elder boy heard a Â«p:rit voice say,
"Agnus Dei," and heard distinctly the rattle
of distant rine fire. When he returned to New
York he learced that the grandmother of the
other two boys, who were his cousins, had
heard on tr.e same night and at the same hour
of the night the rattle of guns firing and the
spirit voice saying "Agnus Dei." He learned
that the other twain had gone to the war iv
Mexico, and he found in the grandmother's
rOvin the "Agnus Dei" he hr.'l trlven his be
loved cousin, but pressed out of shape and hav
ing a b'.ood >tain on it. He attempted to trace
them In Mexico, and he four.a tha: both the

he heard the rifle reports at s<?a and the mys

in their last hours and buried them. He said
the younger boy was put in his grave with the
Agnus Dei on his breast. They dug up the
body. The Agnus Pei was gone.
Harry subsequently lost this marvelous
Agnus Dei, end many years after, while he
was living here in San Francisco, it was mys
teriously returned to him through the instru

FAMED FLORENCE.
LITERARY LANDMARKS OF FLORENCEâ
By Laurence Hutton. Harper A Brother, New
Tort. Pric* *1. For aaio by A. H. Kobertson,
PCS', s:ree:, City.
The literary celebrities who have lived In
Florence make that city an interesting spot to
all lovers of letters. Laurence llutton'a litt c
book contains chat about the famous authors
who have dwelt there and the houses in
which they lived. Ha claims that the book
hes much Information which does not exls
elsewhere, mid that he has cleared upanum
ber of doubtful points about D*nte and Boc
caccio. The house in which Dante lived, he
tells us, has been so moJera.z d as scarcely to
be of any interest. There are a nnmber of
illustrations in the book of places made very
interesting by their association with famous
people, and one of Savonarola's cell shows the
quarters of the austere monk to have been
very ; ictur.sque, with it* arched door and
root, its tesselated floor and artistically barred
window. He -at in an antique Grecian chair,
and a crucifix adorned his desk. The two
villas ia which the guy ladies and gallants
met to tell the famous and frolicsome tales of
Boccaccio' 3 "Decameron" are located and de
scribed. The room which George Eliot once
occupied in Florence was later used by
: Thomas Hardy, and the author imagines the
' spirits of Romola acd TesÂ« meeting there.
There is a picture o the Villa Landor in
which Walter Savage Landor lived alone- till
solitude made him truly savage. Out of one
of the dining-room windows of this villa he
once threw his cook. He regretted this deed
ever after, because, he satd.it spoiled a fine
tulip bed of whicn he was very fond. The
house where G alileo dwelt Is shown, and the
i Casa Guido windows made famous by Mrs.
Browning. Her tomb in that city it very beau
tiful. Of the Casa Bella, where Nathaniel
Hawthorne wrote some of his famous fiction,
we are told that it has' a summer-house in its
garden â "a spot in which above all others one
would choose to sit and muse and dream of a
Btory." :
THE MARCH MAGAZINES.
The Century.
The Century for March is an "inauguration
number," and is one of a series of special
issues which will make the present year of
that magazine of more than ordinary interest
to Its readers The Century was never more
popular than at present. Its January ana
February numbers went out of print within a
week of issue, and its two leading serials,
"Campaigning With Grant, " by General
Horace Por:er, and "Hugh Wynne, Free
Quaker," Dr. Weir Mitchell's novel of the
American Revolution, are attracting wide
spread interest. Dr. Mitchell's atory, the scene
of which is laid in Philadelphia, has doubled
the sale of the magazine in that city. This in
auguration immb.T contains several articles
which will have a special interest to Ameri
cans at this time. One. 'Our Fellow-Citizen of
the White House," by C. C. BueL describes
the official life of a President, and is illus
trated by Jay Hambridge and others. Three
frontispiece portraits are given with the num
, berâtwo of President-elect McKinley and
one of President Cleveland at his deskâ ail of
them made from photographs specially taken
for the Century. J. B. Bishop contributes an
article on "Inauguration Scenes and Inci
dents." with stories and pictures relating to
some famous inaugurations of the past. The
Librarian of Congress describes the splendid
| building just completed for the National Li
brary, and William A. Coffin, the art critic,
writes of its decorations. These articles on
the new library, with the twenty-six illustra
tions accompanying them, form the most com
plete account of the subject yet printed. It is
| noted in an editorial on "A Good Example in
Government Building" that the library build
ing was completed within the time limit and
at a saving of $140,000 on the total appropri
ation. The great municipal building in Phila
delphia cost $1 GO per cubic foot, while 'his
has cost but 63 cents a cubic foot Including
decorations. Captain Alfred T. Mahan writes
of Nelson's most famous battle, Trafalgar, and
among the illustrations is one showing the ar
rangement of the signal flags, spelling out the
sentence "England expects every man wilt do
his duty." AuoUier illussraUoo is t& Â«oÂ«;ay
ing by Timothy Cole of Tamer's fcrreÂ»t picture
"The Old Temeraire."
Harper's.
Harper's Magazine for the month of March
I will oi>en with a iigaincant and timely paper,
"Prep&redneis for War," by Captain A. T.
Mahtn, L\ 3. N., who will show how our con
; sistent euforcemeat of the Monroe doctrine
j involves ereater probability of (onflict with
I Kuropean powers, and will outline a scheme
j for defense by sea. In ' the second
I paper ,f tne series entitled "The Awakening
of a Nation," Charles F. Lummls will de
! scribe the religious, charitable and political
institutions of Mexico, which not only were
the first, but are am^ng the mosi nighly
I developed in the American hemisphere.
j The illustration? will portray the magnificent
I public works of the City of Mexico,
and the monuments of art and architec
ture which make it the handsomest capi
tal in America. "Astronomical Progress of the
I Century," the second of a series of amply
j illustrated papers on the modern contribu
i tiona to science, by Dr. hev.ry Smith Williams,
j will trace the deve'.opment of the latest
I theory of the universe, unfolding a scientific
) actuality more stupendous in its reaches of
i imagination than the cosmography of the
â¢'Divine Comedy" or "Paradise Lost." George
dv Maurler's "The Martian" will be even more
autobiographic than usual, many of the events
occurring just at they happened to Da
Maurier. Tne feature of the installment is the
! Intervention of the inhabitant of Mars, from
j whom the novel takes its name. The illustra
j tions represent Dv Maurier's work at its best.
In "The Las; of a Great Black Nation" Poult
ney Blgelow wilt describe the English rule In
Lasutolfind, and will detail the arts of oppor
i tuniÂ«m by which Moshesh, the national hero of
; the Basutos, earned the title of the "Blsmarc*
of South Africa." The paper will bo sp'.eadldly
illustrated by It- Caton Woodvllle. In 'The
| Decadence of the Nt-w England Deep-sea Fish
| cries" Josepn Wi.li m Collins will record the
development of canning and ice-packing in
America, ani will show how they have
affected the most ptcturesque and venture
some of our industries. The article will be
lully illustrated by Carlton T. Chapman.

for instance, is the March number â not too
balky to go comfortably into the pocket of the

yet it finds room for six serials in addition to
all its wealth of minor feaures and its two de
partments. The seriaU, tco. are worth while.
Here is Laurence Huiton's account of the life
of 'A Boy I Knew,' that it, of himself in New
York City during the time of the Voinn
teer Fire Deportment; and that remarkable
story of the War of the Rebellion, toid by
W. H. Sheltonâ artist, author and soldier;
'mi "Master Skylark'" by the delighttul
"Jack Bennett oi Chllicothe"; and Miss
Baylor's sketch of the spoiled child "Nna
Barrow'; and Nosh brooks' retelling
of Marco Po'.o's alTentures; while "June's
Garden," by Marion Hill, is a deilgtu to chil
dren whose cheeks can dimple over fun. or
whose eyes can fi:i with deiicious tears when
the heroine is at her wit's end. But, if you
don't read serials there is still enough to sat
isfy you. Being the March number, in a Presl- !
denttal year, there is an excellent account of
the inauguration ceremonies, Irom the ride to
the Capitol to the grand ball at night And
besides there is a "Century of Praridents"; o
set of interesting prize-questions about United
Sta ten history; a Western story, "Jed's Wind
! mill," showing how a child's toy saved three
j lives, and Miss Kate Sweeter's lively story
called "Teddy Balrd's Luck"â about how a
policemnn arrested Teddy for scorcaine, and
i thereby assisted in the escape of the burglars.
Mr. Kelyea illustrates this. For practical arti
cles it offers Charles K. Thurstou'Â» "Harbor De
fenses," showing what a warm reception the
'. American Eagl-i will soon offer any of his
, friends the enemy who may desire to try tar
get-practice against the Brooklyn bridge. Or
I it shows you what Gustav Kobbe has to say
about "QueÂ«r Craft"â snd queer enough they
areâ especially the Portuguese fiÂ«hing-boai.
: After seeing this craft, we are not surprised to
! learn that to the "tarry sailor mar." all queer
craft are "Poriugee." Then, too, "Animal
Tracks in the Snow," as descr Ded by Mr. Hos
i kins, will open a new page in Nature's book
to many a keen-eyed youngster. And for
,' verse â this March number has no reason to
dread comparison with its feilowy, for ltshows
proully, the "Rhyme of Drumlie Drummer,"
by Mrs. Richards, with Birch's delightful plc
j tures; 'Little Shadow Folk"â a dainty bitof
; verse by ( har'.es Crandall; "The Little French
| Poodle," by Laura Cate; and "All in the Win
ter Weather"â a delightful bit of fairyland, by
Grace Wlnthtopâ with fairies and bugaboos by
1 Birch.
McClure*s.
Following are some of the good things to be
! found in the March issue of McClure's
} Magazine:
An article by W. D. Howclls on Rudysrd
Kipling as a poet. The first installment of a
; fine tale of adventure by Robert Louis Steven
' son, left unpublished at his death. It is a
I love story, having for its hero a French soldier
. held a prisoner of war in Edinburgh Castle
and for its heroine an aristocratic Scotch
maiden whom he meets there. A thrilling
chapter of secret war history will be related
by General John It, Thayer, formerly United
States Senator from Nebraska. It Is an ac
count of a night he passed alone with Secre
! tary Stanton in the War Office when the latter
: was expecting that Prti;dent Johnson would
j attempt to dUpossess him of his office by force
jof arms. Full-page -portraits, from recent
i photographs, of President-elect McKtnley and
j his mother. An account of his own
adventures and experiences as a surgeon
on a Greenland whaler by Conan Doyle.
: The paper will be illustrated with
j numerous pictures of Arctic sealing and
j whaling. A paper by Hamlln Garland on
I "Grant'i Quiet Years at Northern Posts,"
waich will emboiy personal recollections of
Grant by his old comrsdes and associates at
Sacketto Harbor, Detroit, and on the Pacific
Coast, and will tell the story of his resignation
i Irom the army.
Godey's.
Godey's Magazine lor March Is notable for
tha variety of it? topics and the versatility of
Its general meie-up. The leading article, on
"Pastime Photography," shows what pleasing
work can be done by a skillful use of the
camera and livin 7 model*. It is fully illus
trated with quaint and pretty pictures. Fol
lowing this is "Modern Art iv Piano-build
ing," illustrated with pictures ol the most
beautiful instruments of recent make. These
pictures will surprise many people. "Dresden
Opera" receives treatment, with illustrations,
and will interest not only musical people, but
general readers as well. Among the "spe
cials" of timely interest is ''Handsome News
paper Women." with portraits. In which
Mlsa Helen Winslow of the Boston Transcript
describes the life and work ot several promi
nent beautiful women of the press. The strong
fiction of the issue ia "The Separatist
Preacher," by May Kelsev Champion, wno
tells her tale in an intense and forceful man
ner. Few people nre famiiar with the separa
tist movement of 1740, and the nory will be a
revelation to many. Humorous fiction is
tound in "Cupid Â»nJ Pegasus," by Jean Mey
ers, and tragedy in "Ugo," a taie of the circus
ring, by Clara Sprague Ross; and many other
goo 1 itoriea help to fill the number. An espe
cially timely anJ interesting feature of the
magazine is "Among the Ferns," by Charles
F. Saunder-', with drawings from the living
ferns by Elizabeth Moore Kallowell. Fern
lovers will find in this article much that is
helpful and pleasing. Practical topics are
1 covered well in "Standard Time and Time
j Tables," by a railroad man, and by '-Sam
1 JohnslDg," who discourses feelingly of the "De

HOME LIFE OF H. C. BINNER.
By W. C. Bvmrver.
|^S!SyIFTED writers on either side of the
IJ^^ A'.iantic have b2en most lavish in
%_jj^ their praise of H. C. Bunner, the
' writer. The most eloquent peas have
told of their admiration for his work. Little
has been said of Bunner the man, and, aside
from the article in the Bookman by his life
loug friend. l.aurcr.c.' Hatton, I believe al
most nothing has been said of his home life.
A short biographical sketch may be of interest
here to show the difficulties a journalist must
surmount ere anything approaching public
approbation can be obtained.
Henry Cuyler Bunner was born in Oswego,
V. V., forty-two years ago. Among his im
mediate ancestors were the Sciiuyiers, Van
Rensselaers, Churches and others of the old
Knickerbocker stock. His father, being a Co
lumbia man, designed that his son should be
educated at that famous college and moved to
New York City that he might better accom
plish his purpose. The boy was placed for a
preparatory course in the private acaaemy of
Dr. Kalsen, who^e establishment was then
situated about the region of Forty-second
street, east of Broadway. Here young Bunner
made a most brilliant record, outstripping sH
h: s classmates in English literature, French.
German and the dead languages. But, alas!
the father's fond hopes were not to be realized.
Business reverses came, his fortune was swept
away and the good man's death soon followed.
On the loss of his fortune the old gentleman
thought he had learned a great object lesion.
Being a pio'essional man, a lawyer of the
old scnoo', he saw the successful merchant
wax wealthy on the rains of his own comfort-

Knickerbocker stock. His father, being a Co
lumbia man, designed that his son should be
able fortuue. "My son shall be a merchant,"
was his logical conclusion. So this bright boy
was duly entered on the books of a most an
cient and respectable firm of Portugese im
porters that he might learn the art of money
making. Nothing could have been more un
congenial to the tastes of young Bunner than
the hr.miruci calling of a prosaic merchan'.
His employers soon decided tba r . he was not
fitted for a commercial career. Instead of de
voting his attention to the casting up of long
columns of figures on the ledger, he was con
tinually writing bits of verse and prose on
blotters or any blank papers convenient
about his de c k. Finally the l^-ead of this most
respectable firm was obliged to inform the
embryo merchant that his services were no
longer require! tad that he might resign with
the kind permission of nil concerned. 8o
ended the brief commercial career' of Bunner
the merchant, and thus began the life of Ban
ner the wr.ter.
Now came the time when he must choose his
own way in life. Tne selection was soon made.
The daily papers offered the only inducements
consistent with his tastes, so Bunner entered
the literary lists as an ordinary reporter on
the New York Sun, the most exacting of all
American newspapers. He was soon asked to
pilot a new venture known as the Arcadian,
which proved but a weakly infant, and soon
sickened and died. At this time Messrs. Sw&n
man and Kepp'er were struggling hard to keep
a little German pictorial above the surface,
and at a dinner of the most pronounced oo
hemian character it was decided to ask Mr.
Bunner to take charge of Its letter-press. This
offer was gladly accepted, and soon Puck be
came a power in the land.
Mr. Bunner occupied a most enviable posi
tion. Editor of a popular weekly in the creat
city of New York at the a<e of 23 ; surrounded
by a circle of charming friends, the very
choicest spirits cf Bo' emia, such men as
Laurer.ci Hinton, deor?e Larsons Lathrop,
Walter Learned of New London, Edwin Booth,
George H. Jessup, Joseph Jefferson and a hos!
of others, all loyal, pool fellows. Ttis com
pact of true friendship, although made some
twenty years ago, was never broken, save by
death.
Elercn years ago Mr. Bunner married Miss
Allot Learned, daughter of a New London
banker, aid sister of Walter Learned, the poet
ana magazine writer. The match was a
most delightful union of kindred spirits.
Mrs. Bunner was at once recog
nized as a charming entertainer, and
withal, a kind-hearted, benevolent littie
lady whom everybody loved, ishe seemed
like an inspiration to her husband, for soon
after this happy marriage Mr. Bunner began
work of a more ambitious sort. He was no
longer content with his weekly contributions
to Puck, but buckled down to the bard
task of writing a book ana at the same time
became a contributor to the leading maga
zines. A year after marriage Mr Bunner pur
chased their beautiful little home in Nutley,
N. J.,one of the most charming New York
suburbs. Although in another State, it
was easily reacned by crossing the North
River, lying about as convenient to New York
as does Oakland to San Francisco.
Here was established a happy home Indeed,
using the term in its broadest sense, for na
ture and art had combined to make It beauti
ful, both within and without. Imagine a
beautiful, old-fashioned house with many
gables, surrounded by a miniature forest of
beeches, elms and chestnuts; a velvety lawn,
girded by a low stone wall, which, by the by,
nobody every respected, but stepped over at
tue most convenient spot. A. coaafonaole, sa*ay
veranda equipDed with pretty hammocks and
the most inviting of wicker-chairs, a broad
open door, and it seemed to be everonen, lead
ing into a square hall, whicn occupied the
very center of the house. Doors opened from,
this hall into the dining-room, parlor and
Ibrarj, and it was a hbrary, too. Such a pro
fusion of books!
Books, books everywhere, and Just such
books as one would care to read. The rarest
gems of poetry and prose in German, French
and English. Then came the cheery dining
rooin, with its hospitable oaken table, and
sideboard garnished with quaint pieces of the
old, old family plate. And what brilliant din
ners that dear old room has seen! Here were
frequently assembled the most noted writers,
wits and artists of this generation. Here re
partee and bright sayings flashed forth like
pparks from an overcharged galvanic ma
chine. No bit of scandal was ever discussed
at this cheerful board, and its unwritten
motto might bear emulation in every home:
"Gossiping tongues come not here."
Mr. Bunner's relicious training came to a
full stop early in life. His father being of the
Episcopal faith intended to trsin his son to
thai belief. His mother was of old Puritani
cal New England stock und was a strict Uni
tarian. She was a Tuckerman of Boston. >'at
nrally a discussion arose as to which faith the,
boy should Inherit The father, being a
sensible men, compromised by proposing to
leave the matter to the sou's own choice
when he shouid have arrived at the age of
discretion. The result was that he rejected
both and formulated one of his own. A very
simple creed, indeed, the Golden Rule, which,
he considered the very keystone of all re
ligious architecture, and never man came
nearer living up to the very letter of his
laith than did the subject of this slcetcn.
Limited space prevent* my giving a very
definite idea of Mr. Bunner's attempts to re
lieve suffering humanity. This one instance
â will suffice to explain some of Mr. Bunner's
local charity worn. The local physician told
the writer that Mr. Bunner made this request
ten years ago.
"Doctor, see to it that no m&n, woman or
child within the range of your practice wants
for attendance, medicine, foÂ«d or necessary
cothing. Send all bills to me."
"You may be sure," said the doctor, "calls
have been frequent, but never was one of
these drafts dishonored. All were promptly
paid upon presentation. God bless his gen
erous soul."
I have mentioned that the door of thli
i happy home was ever open. And so it was to
j all friends and neighbors. Likewise a spacious
! sideboard, which was provisioned like a snip
; for a long cruise with every sort of cheering
i refreshment, including cigars, pipes, tobaccos,
j etc. And here you were expected to regale
yourself in the absence of the host. There
: was but one stipulation. Mr. Bunner had de
veloped the most decided dislike for politics,
and to crevent any mention of this subject he
cad written the following lines and posted
taem in a conspicuous place:
To those who would In quiet dwell
Political brawls are simpy bell.
Smoke your pipe and drink your drink,
Bui bear la mi. id your mouth can't think.
Thc-e lines are from memory, so the writer
j asks forgiveness if they are misquoted.
There was nothine terrible about this good
man's death. All was as peaceful and calm as
hisd3arest friends could have wished. I was
called to his bedside a few hours before the
end and listened to a few simple requests.
And most rationnl they were. Mrs. Bunner
was arranging little ornaments about the
,-oom when he called to her:
"Alice, am I alone?"
"Why, no, dear; lam here," she answered.
"Of course, you are, darling. What a silly
question to ask."
An amused smile overspread his face that
seemed to say:
"How could I ask that loving little woman
such a question?" The eyes ilofly closed as II
for quiet slumber.
This was the end.
LITERARY NOTES.
The first English edition of "Ziska," Marie
Corelli's new novel, which Stone &. Kimball
will bricg out this month, was 50,000 copies.
Drexel Biddle, publisher, of Philadelphia,
announces a second edition of -'The Froggy
Fairy Book," wh.ch was favorably reviewed in
numerous American newspapers last Christ
mas.
It is remarkable to note how tne sale oJ
"The Damnation of Theron Ware" continues.
Almost a year's sale does not seem to have
diminished the demand, and the publisher!
find difficulty in keeping the trade supplied.
The interest in Ibsen seems to be reviving.
His last play, "John Gabriel Bortman," has
been quite the sensation In London for the
past month. The book is published in this
country by Messrs. Stone & Kimball in their
"Green Tree Library."
Ouida, who. for a woman. Is not so hard
hearted as she is spiteful, writes in the West
minster Gazette: "As there are not more than
two out of every hundred books issued in
England worth the paper they are printea on,
it would be well if the press gave more atten
tion to the two, and none at all to the othÂ«r
ninety-eight."
There were 6573 novels published in the
United Kingdom in 1896, being an iucrease of
over 100 in new works and of 200 in reprints
as compared with 1895. The issue of theo
logical, educational and poetical works had
not increased, but tnere were 200 more his
torical books. The totals are lower, but the
proportions are probably about the same in
the United States.

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
This very em.irt French tailor-made pown is of suede-colored cloth, trimmed with black velvet, embroidered with gold. The bolero of
snede cloth :s cut out in pointi over a fitted bodice of velvet, embroidered with gold. The cloth sleeves open upon a puff of velvet, Buttons
of engraved silver close tlie bolero and fasten the clotn sleeve to the puff.
M'jOUSQUETAIRE sleeves nre pro
Â£ claimed to be the thing for every
1 up-to-date evening and dinner
dress during the comine season. They
may be e-volved from a very transparent
fabric, such as beaded tulle, Chantilly
lace or mousseline de soie, gouged at the
seams and falling over the hands to the
.knuckles.
' The latest accordion-pleated skirts ema
nate from one of the leading dressmakers
in Paris. The new accordion pleating Is
alluded to as an "inventory," and it is
declared by fashion's votaries that it will
enjoy a great vogue, as it can be applied
to velvet, satia or tulle with equal ease,
as the pleats are only formed from the
hips and therefore do not increase the
size of the figure, which was formerly
one of the greate?t disadvantages
of accordion pleating. One such model
skirt greatly admired is of white
taffetas embroidered with bouquets
of jet; the bodice draped and em
broidered after the same manner. Witu
it was worn a Marie Antoinette fichu in
â mousseline de soie. Make a mental note
of the fact (you may positively depend
"upon my prediction) t bat fichus will be
much worn by fashionable women East
all through this summer, for they are
again to be the mode. Mile. Sorel a few
weeks ago wore one of white mousseline
de soie, edged with two frills, over a
bodice pf deep blue silk gauze upon a
mauve silk lining. The sfcirt was of taf
feta*; beautifully embroidered and very
much gouged .at the hips. Tho eltect by
the white fichu and the long mousquetaire
sleeves is said to have been most pictur
esque. The fichus are always worn
slightly open at the throat, being most
becoming when so arranged unless the
wearer is most painfully thin.
Gloves for evening dress are always
either white, cream or a pale shade to
match the dress, and when long are fin
ished at the top with a fall-off cuff of
white lace scangleJ so as to either inatcn
the spangles on the cowa or to repeat
some tone in the coloring. They are heid
in place round the arm with narrow rib
bons â white, mauve or pink, according to
the dress â and tied with frisky little bows,
which should not have any ends. The
latest gloves have the three seams cmbroi
derod with small spangles sewn on so as
to fit over one another like fish scales.
Such spangles may be either red, gold,
silver or of any appropriate color, but nat
urally the mousquetaire sleeve will do
away with long gloves.
Fup on Spring Organdy
Would not seom so very unseasonable
were it applied to woolen or silken fabrics,
but what do you think of a sheer white
organdy being beautiful, not only with a
lace applique, but also with a border of
line sabie, it is said to be a simply ravish-
Lngly lo.ve]y creation and vastly becoming.
HoVever, most of us will content our
selves with the evolution of dainty, fetch
ing frocks for the coming months, adorned
simply with laces and insertions, ribbons
and frills galore, and during the long,
quiet Lentcu days much thought can be
expanded in such vanities, but that re
minds me that I have heard little tales
concerning events that will take place
during the penitential period, which
makes me wander whether it will be very
strictly ob-erved; however, that is an
.other siory, and to return to the organdies,
mulls, chiffons, mousseliues dc soie and
grenadines, be sure if you cannot have a
silken foundation for each one, to at Jeast
taavÂ« three perfectly titled, and then you
can make some really pretty little things
yourselves with a small amount of
patience, but let the dressmaker handle
the foundations, unless you have had a
considerable amount of experience.
Last summer I was much amused at
one young woman who was constantly
telling her frienus aiÂ»out how she had
made all her light dresies. Well, she is a
regular beanpole, so she had all the silk
slips most carefully fitted and padded by
one of the best women here, and then she
really did make the little confections of
aiuslin and lace, for which she received
numberless compliments, but she never
told who made those lovely bHds, and we
can all take a leaf from her book and po
and do likewise, and thus have a ward
robe full of really charming garment at
the smallest possible outlay, but the >urn
absolutely necessary for our uirls to ex
pend for their frocks will be considerable
doring the next few week* if they have
aspiration* to be smartly robed, as a great
deal more trimming must be used oa all
dresses this summer, and therein lies
the expense, for example, from 200 to
400 yards of lace and almost the same
number of yards of insertion, fiÂ«ure, on
one simple little organdy, which has a
creamy gown covered with natural seizei
Duchess de Brabant rosebuds, made over
a rose pink glace silk foundation.
Almost as pretty was one of pure white
i over pale-green silk. It had numberless
} frills, on every one of which were three
rows of narrow preen satin ribbon. Such
dainty belongings cannot be owned by us
all, and I suggest that those who cannot
i afford several such dresses â of course, I
' am most ail the while thinking of those
who go out a great deal or entertain con
siderably â should instead select-two pretty
! lieht taffeta silks and have them made
I perfectly, with different vests or tichus of
| raousseline or chiffon, and they will give
i an immense amount of satisfaction at the
I smallest possible expenditure, for a cer
tain outlay is absolutely necessary for any
one who has any ambition "to keep up
with the procession," otherwise take my
advice,_Btay at home and only see your
intiraato friends.
I know a true story about a very fash
ionables New York matron who bad two
beautiful daughters, who had just made
their cebut most successfully in the ap
proaching sprin :. She informed her hus
band what sum would be necessary to
supply their wardrobes for Newport and
lie promptly told her that such an amount
he could not afford, having just suffered a
financial loss. This wife did not weep,
but calmly thought about the situation,
and arrived at this conclusion that to goto
Newport without certain frocks was not

Sun-Pleating.
As it is to be most fashionable for all
transparent fabrics, Ist me explain that it
is a wide, flat side-pleating. Two years
ago it was introduced iv New York by a

well-known Broadway house, but it did
not take East. However, the Parisians
went into raptures over its charms. As a
result we are now receiving imported
evening frocks in this country from
France made up most delightfully out of
juin-pleated, gauzy fabrics. Let mo cau
tion you not to have your best frocks
made until the styleof skirt has lv?en posi
tively decided on, as the close-sheathing
skirt has already taken a fixed hold, and.
with the exception of the skirts for the
sheerest stuffs, it will be the model by
which all fashionable skirts will be cut.
Besides, remember most of ihr-m are to be
hung over a separate silk skirt, which
wili be very considerably narrower. Num
berless models and daring creations are
every season offered for our contempla
tion, but the wise woman with a small
income always waits as long as poisible
until things are definitely decided, so as
to have her few gowns in advance of the
styles here if possible.
Concerning sleeves, Vogue tells us: "Re

row bias black satin flounces. The waist is trimmed with five tiny rowi of pale blue satin.

naissance sleeves are to be undoubtedly
the model for the coming season, the ami
fitted closely, with the tops frilled or
puff (id into fullness. That entirely tight
titting sleeves will be a little more general
would not be surprising, for a few were
seen last summer, and through the winter
we have met them occasionally. Those
who choose to wear them will be quite on
tl.o safe side, but the favorite sieeve, the
most becoming one. will be one which
gives the length of arm with long wrists,
clearly delined, end is topped off with a
jockey."
JI .Model Bolero
Fastening down one sdo and showing
a little frill of lace or lisse, revealing just
a peen of light under the bodice, is most
popular. The sleeves of this are made
with epaulettes trimmed with velvet rib
bons or with black silk braid, and the cos
tume ia generally completed by a plain
cloth skirt, either light or dark in color,
which may or may not be braided. When
made of black velvet sucli a bodice may
be worn for the next two months for in
formal visiting.
Very comfortable are the new bodices
mnde of lucked crepe de chine completed
with a linen collar and rihbon stock.
It is noticeable that the bolero form of
boJice in cloth or velvet, worn over some
light waistcoat of the lace or lisse order,
still has numerous fashionable devotees.
Two JlmericanÃ in Paris.
A Paris correspondent writes that quite
lately Mrs. Vanderbilt called on the
(American) Countess de Castellane, and
on that occasion wore nn Ophelia green
moire. At the left ride of the skirt was a
panel trimmed with the new vandyked
buttonholed tabs edged with tinsel thread.
Every point was fastened with a jeweled
button. Down the left aide of the bodice
and on tbe sleeves were pleatincs of lace,
the falls of lace forming large bows, with
a jewelel button in the center of each.
The Countess received her friend at
tired in an at-home gown of cream-tinted
satin, which had a draped front of pink
satin, over which fell gracefully a garni
ture of rare old lace. The Waiteau back
fell in rich folds of satin, covered with
apple blossoms painted by hand.
Jiairdpessing.
Thii all-important topic deserves much
thought, and at the present moment
flowers, such as lilies of t. c valley, rose*
and violets, are being extensively used,
in combination with Â»;racefuily tied moire
bows. Very youthful debutantes are
wearing Jittle half-wreaths of small
fijwers. their older sisters p-eferring a
rose with two empire tip 3 richly spangled.
Tiny pompons with osprey aigrettes nre
like I, as are also ostrich plumes. At a
certain valentine party a beautiful girl
wore a rose falling at the nape of the
neck, the color of the rose matching the
ostrich tips on either shoulder.
The most fashionable coiffures show the
hair waved and toss d lightly back rather
than drawn back, and arranged in artistic
loops nnd puff* surmounted by an aigrette
caught with a jeweled ornament. A few
curls fall over the temples, or there may
be no bangs at all if desired, the waved
pompodour being in vogue.
In many instances the hair is waved
from the nape of the neck; after reaching
a certain height upon the head the liny
waves merge into a series of puffs, tne one
toward the front forming the pompadour.
A jeweled star, a bandeau of diamonds
and emeralds or of diamonds and olivines,
or two white wings rising from a jeweied
ornament, form a pretty finish to an
evening coiffure. The favorit6 place just
now for tne mass of hair is near that part
of the head which is most distant from
the chin. The place has to be varied
slightly in order to be becoming, the rule
b?ing 10 wear it high, and when a bat Is
worn it must not show below.
â¢Handkerchiefs.
Very elaborately embroidered are the
latest and no longer are floral designs in
vopue â birds and insects being now the
most correct ornamentations. On one
beautiful mouchoir are butterflies in each
of the four corners, on another a line of
swallows extend diagonally across the
center. Bees and flias border many and
the embroideries are to be i:ad in white or
in contracting shades, and some olaided
borders are shown. For mourning are
obtainable very exquisite handkerchiefs
witl) either white or deep violet cambric
centers edged with black duchesse lace.
Novelties are liked in cotton foulards
find batiste, being exquisitely fine in tex
ture as well as artistic in tints.
Monograms are done in outline stitch,
and are frequently piacel in the center of
the handkerchief. This is, however a
matter of fancy, but must always be
framed by a circle in some correspond
ingly attractive emDroiderv stitch.
Ecru linen handkerchiefs, with stripes
or checks of lavender, reseda green or old
pink, are among the smart combinations
for general utility purposes.
Handkerchiefs to match the gown in
color are quite the proper thing, and for
evening wear filmy bits of mousseline de
soie, edged by several ruffles of point
d'esprit lace, only are correct.
The minor accessories of the toilet are
demanding great attention, and none is

receiving more than the handkerchiefs of
'97. which ars daintily exquisite in design
and manufacture.
Oup Petticoats
Now demand as much attention as our
gloves or shoes, and for street wear none
are so stylish as those of the very best
quality of black taffeta, made with corded
ruffles. Frequently two or three are sewn
on together, thus giving the appearance
around the bottom of three distinct
skirls. The cords are usually set in clus
ters of five or three. Through some of
them are run featlierbone of the lightest
and most flexible quality, but a stiff cord
is preferred by most women. I have
heard of one especially handsome skirt,
which had a triple-foot flounce. On the
top one wasappliqued a heavy pattern of
guipure lace set in quite flatly.
It is the greatest possible mistake to put
lace on petticoats to be worn on tne
street, as it collects dust, germs and mi
crobe?, and is not only untidy but dan
gerous as well, for it tears easily, and so
has a tendency to trip up the wearer.
Truly gorgeous are many of Â»he petti
coats designed for house wear, the most
beautiful and costly of silks and laces be
ing lavishly consumed in their composi
tion. One such garment for a bride is. of
a rich heavy white silk covered with
bunches of pale pink rose? ; round the bot
tom is a lace-edued frill of rose pins taf
leta covered with one of fine white lace,
which has as a heading a quilling of tne
tai'f-ta. Indeed, no woman having any
irretentions to dressing well would think
her wardrobe complete without at least
half a dozen of silken shirts, many of
which owe their charms to the fact that
madame is an excellent shopper and un
derstands how charmingly odds and ends
can be put together at
small outlay.
The Tupban
Is the form of bat now to be worn on all
dressy occasions and it will shortly be
seen here in all colors and shades of
velvet and tulle. One turban just noted
in Paris was of turquoise tulle, trimmed
with a black velvet cnou and a long white
feaibor. Another waÂ» in cerise velvet
with two bluet tips fastened, en aigrette,
with a brooch of diamond*, and v third
was of whito tulle, trimmei with black
and white feathers. These turbans are
said 10 be easily mad*, only a tight-fitting
shnpe being necessary. The crown is
covered with plain velvet and the border
is a wide piece of either tulle or velvet
very closely twisted and attached at the
side where feathers and ornaments are
placed. Perhaps, after we have seen one
or two such models we might be able to
make one, but I should not like to experi
ment, so I advise you all to watch for
the openings of our leading milliners,
as thus far, excepting the turbans,
there are no distinct novelties in the
market except in bats, and a peep at some
of these which I have just enjoyed reveals
to me the popularity of glace silk, of
bright-colored straws, and of black tulle
bats with crowns embroidered in dia
monds or sequins. The artificial flowers
are more lovely than ever, and the best
examples of new millinery shows roses of
the brightest pink with a wealth of foli
age, these being used at the sole decora
tion to hats of dark red or cerise-colored
straw. These light straws which we
adopted last year are again to have our
favor; tne blue, the pink, the gieen, and
the mauve all reappearing, but at the mo
ment, perhaps, if we want to buy a new
hat we should eschew the charms of these,
it is too early for their immediate wear,
and choose rather one of the little toques
elaborately tucked and trilled of black
tuile traced with diamonds, turned up at
one side, with a couple of black feathers
and flowers. Such a style as this might
safely be allowed to accompany any gown
anywhere.
Oup Tables.
Table decoration is undergoing quit* a
change. Some ladies who have become
expert at the Honiton lace work have
combined the effect with rich embroidery
on a center iinen piece surrounded by the
border of Honiton. A recent Juncheon
showed the table all in white save the
effect of soft color produced by violet
sprays on the center linen piece of the
Honiton at the center of the table. Before
each guest's place were tiny doilies of the
same style for the glass butter-plate and
salt-cellar. These latter, by the way,
were imported from Russia and were
enameled little bowls in the quaint silver
smith's designs of the Russian domains
with -mall ladles of The same in eacn.
The floral center was ferns with fragrant
violets. The whole was Veritably a dream
of beauty. Marcella.
Style for Men.
The question is frequently asked why do
some men seem to impart a certain air to
every garment worn by them, and others,
who patronize better and more expensive
tailors, never look especially well. Natur
ally the way garments are put on has a
good deal to do with this effect, but a man
when giving his orders for a new suit
should Kr.ow exactly what he wants and
not allow the tHilor to make it as he
pleases. Apropos of this one authority says :
"Your clothes must be right. Bow to get
them right is indeed a hard problem to
solve. When I go to a tailor and he
marches me up to a r:diculoua old chromo
that shows off some men in dowdy clothes
I protest. When be tells me that the old
chromo is an authentic and reliable fash
ion plate, 'from the very best authorities
sir,' I boil.
"Do not let any tailor show you a fashion
p'.ate. There is not one that is correct,
up-to-date or proper. Men's fashion plates
usually represent the idea of some poor
cutter and designer, who was brought up
in the tenement district or some other
plebeian quarter. He gets so much a year

exclaimed. But the practical man, whom
the world now honors, /stood the egg on

to every schoolboy. I am reminded of it
just now by an effusion which appeared :
in last Tuesday's Examiner from an
astronomical critic signing himself A. H.

repose threatened by the contemplation
of the great and terrible wrong that I am
perpetrating upon an unsuspecting and
guileless people by setting tnem to think
ing for themselves.
The distinguished astrononrcal amateur
critic says that the discovery of a second
satellite to the earth (and which 1 had the
pleasure to chronicle through the pages Of
last Sunday's Call) is a "fake." and he
misquotes a so-called ".'aw of Kepler" in
support of his cry. There are critics and

complish this latter we mast read a great

movements of any heavenly body we must
know its "elements."
In the above diagram the ellipse repre
sents the orbit of a heavenly body. Cis
the center and S the sun. Now to tell
whether a comet, or any other celestial
object, will again appear to us we must
know the size and shape of its orbit, and
to know this we must first learn the mean
distance, or half the longer axis, A P of
the ellipse, in which the body moves
around tbe v sun S. Second, the eccen
tricity, or tne ratio of the distance C S
between the center C and focus S to the
mean distance; third, ihe longitude of
the ascending node; fourth, the inclina
ton of tne plane of the ecliptic; fifth,
the ioiigitud* oHhe perihelion, or point of
ihe orbit nearest to the sun, and s.xth,
the exact time nt which the body passes
this last point. Only in the case of two
or three small comets of short periods
liave these data been attainable. All proph
ecies of the return of comets a:e there ore
only guesswork. Some very Interesting
phenomena have been observed In connec
tion with comet*. The one Known as
Biela'a aroused a great deal of sj/ecuiative
thought. This comet had been in the
habit of reappearing about every six years.
It was <iue to appear in 1872, but failed to
materialize. Instead, there was a very
rich shower of meteors through which the
eaiih passed NuV -mber 27 and 3), 1*72.

It was shorn of its splendor, and in
stead of one cornet there seemed to be two
pieces. The comet hod split. The study
of comets has always had a very fascinat
ing power over amateur astronomers.
\\'<-\ -seasoned astronomers are extremely
coy in dr.bbline with the question of
cometarv origin and movement. The ex
perienced star sharp knows full well that
the speed and ilirertion of quite a number
of comet* have been studied carefully and
partial .success attained in computing the
times of their probable return, but it has
always been found that something has in
terfered to negative the result. The comet ,

j apparatus worked as long ns the tide was
j at the proper height and itie waves rose

I deviation ruined its efficiency and rendered
! it worthless the greater part of the time.
There were also a number of minor
! difficulties peculiar to each machine. If
i they had such and such circumstances
I they would work; if they didn't, they
i would not. Until the present time, as

1552 was said to have a period of 129 year*.
It did return in 166 i, but was absent in
1790. No more ferti.e iield for speculation
is presented to the thought of men than is
offered by the comet. The coln 3sa l tail of
the comet in 18H0. 150,000,000 miles in
length, swept around tha sun in a few
minutes.
Think of tlie enormous velocity and en
deavor to imacine what kind of a fore It
was that swayed that mighty object. No
known law of nature can explain the sud
den shift of position. Evidently we do
not know all the laws of nature, not even
if we happen to be an astronomer. It
would appear thai throughout all the vast
universe exists a something â call it force
if you will â that comprehends all other
forces and that passes from measurable
energy to intangibility, only to manifest
Use f again as recoenizabie energy when
the conditions for such metamorphosis ob
tain. Some forces of nature lie dormant
until they are Drought into contact with
other forces, and then when the combina
tion occurs the resultant energy is of
changed form. That there must be a
something of this character is the only
solution which satisfies the reasoning
mind. Somo day it may be that our in
telligence will comprehend it, but at the
present it does not.
0:;e of the recognized laws of astronomi
cal physics is that every ste.lar body ex
erts some influence, great or small, upon
every other steilar body. They all attract
one another. They all shed their light
upon one another. The sun is popularly
supposed to diffuse heat among the mem
bers of his system. Recently the idea is
gaining ground that each body exerts an
electrical or magnetic influence upon all
other bod es. What influence do the
comets exert? Does the fact of their pres
ence affect our climate ? The first recorded
appearauce of Haliey's comet in ICQ"> was
marked by a gnat famine in Europe; its

excessive cold a:ii crop failure-; that of

This comet is duo to reappear in 1910,
and a numerous army of prophets has
arisen to predict cataclysms and mm r
; calamities during the tir-t ten years of the
roniinz century. It is not only possible,
but very probable, that the earth passes
through the envelopes of comets: through
the gaseous portions of these wanderers.
It is believed by most scientists that the
earth passed tbroa&h Biela's comet in
October, 1871, at which time occurred the
awful conflagrations in the Northwestern
Sta:eÂ«. devastating thousands of square
miles of territory. The survivors of the
terrible tires in Minnesota testify that the
flames would suddenly, without warning,
burst forth in the thick timber, apparently
coming from the sky. The great tire at
Chicago, whero buildings of stone an-i
iron burned like tinJer, occurred at this
time. Did it happen that the caseous en
velope of Biela's comet was hydrogen and
thai it became mingled with the earth's
atmosphere? Who know*?

if all difficulties have been overcome. Tre
possibility of its being wasi.ed away by a
s'orni his been reduced to a minimum,
because it will work at its full efficiency
on a I'2-inch w:iV3 and can consequently
be Ltiilt in a sheltereu place, possibly be
hind a reef out of reach of the heavy
swells. It will automatically adjust itseli
to the size of the waves and the rise and
fall of the tide, with no change in its de
velopment of power.
Mr. ischomberg h;)s a working model of
his apparatus nt 3647 Twentieth street, in
this City, that gives a good iaea of what
the completed motor will look like. It is
simplicity it?elf. In the first place there
is a wharf built of piling, with a platform
on the top. Between a certain set of the
pllea there is a float shaped like a square
fiatboat, that rests on the surface of the
w.'vt* r and rises and falls with the waves
and tide. It is this motion that has been
utilized to develop power.
Attached by a toggle- joint to the center
of the float is a ratchet bar that reaches
upward, when the float is at its lowest
point, a short distance above the platform,
and when the float is at its highest far
into the nir. It is perfectly natural that
the float swinging on the wave tops will
rise and fall a different distance with each
swell. In overcoming this lies the point
of Mr. Schomberg's invention.
The power developed by the rise and
fall of the float is converted into com
pressed air by moans of an ordinary air
pump. But instead of communicating the
power directly from the float to tne piston
the ratchfit bar is made to engage a lever
having its fulcrum at one end and the
other on the ronnecting rod. Tiie ratchet
Dar works midway between the fulcrum
and the connecting roil, so that when it
rises or falls one foot the piston is moved
two feet. Of course this makos a loss of
power, but that is easily compensated for
by making the float larger.
. If the waves always rose and fell just
one foot there would be no need of any
mechanical contrivance to make the ]>isu>u
give a continuous two-foot stroke. Bat
they do not always do that. In case the
waves rose two feet it would be necessary
to have a four-foot cylinder in order to
accommodate the stroke of the ratcuet
bar.
This point Mr. Schomberg has overcome
by controlling a dog that works in the
ratchet bar. When the ratchet bar has
risen one foot and driven the piston its
full two feet, the dog is automatically re
leased, allowing the ratchet bar to ascend
lively through the lever. The distance it
rises is of no importance. It may be two
feet or it may be two inches.
A. H. Babcock Indulges in Some Speculation
Regarding a Recent Discovery
I'iN THE number just issued of the pnb
â ij lications of the Astronomical Society
ms> of the Pacific will be found the in
teresting announcement that the prelimi
nary orbit computed for the last comet
discovered at Lick Observatory by Mr.
Perrine indicates the possibility that it is
identical with Biela's lost comet ot 1852.
Comets are not identifiable by any study
of their visible features, because their ap
pearance may and often does change with
great rapidity. They do possess distinc
tive earmarks in the shape, size and posi
tion of their orbits, with reference to the
earth's orbit.
When a comet is discovered observations
are made for three nights and a prelimi
nary orbit computed. Then the cata
logues of preceding comets are examined
to see whether or not anyprevious orbit was
approximately the same .as the one com-^
puted. Few, if any. comatary orbits are'
exactly in the plane of the earth's orbit,
but are more or less inclined to it. The
angle of inclination as well as the location
of the intersection of the plane of the
comet's orbit with the plane of the earth's
orbu are two elements to be considered in
a comparison of this kind. When these
two quantities correspond closely, and
when combined with this the comet's dis
tance from the sun at the point of nearest
approach and the location cf tnis point
are within certain limits, it is probable that
the two comets are identical. The pre-
J liminary orbits will not settle the ques*
I tion, but a more exact one, based on a
] lar-:e number of observations and extend
ing ovÃr a greater period of time, must be
computed.
Biela's comet of 1852 has a remarkable
history. It was discovered in 182G by the
man whose name it bears, and who was an
i Austrian officer. Gambart investigated
its orbit and announced it to be a periodic
comet of short period, the second one of
tnis kind f o be discovered. It wr.s found
that it hud been observed on two previous
approaches to the sun, in 1772 and in 1803.
Damoiseau calculated its orbit, predicted
its return in 1832, and even went so far as
to state that on October 29 of that year the
two paths, the comet-, and the earth'?,
would cross and the earth would not bo
very far away. There wero sensational
journals even at this early date, and mucli
popular apprehension was created, especi
ally among the peusantry of the south of
France. The scare proved groundless, for
the earth was 50,000,000 miles away on the
I predicted day, and they were never less
i than 15,000.000 miles apart- It was not
visible at its next return owing to its ap
proaching the sun from a direction in the
heavens opposite to that occupied by t c
earth, but in November, 181'j, it again be
came visible, and presented the usual ap
pearance. Three weeks later it began to
elongate and finally in about two weeks
more it divided and became double. Both
parts were very bright, but not equally so,
and when one increased in brightness the
other diminished. Part of the time they
were connected by a faint band of light.
They traveled together, about 160,000 miles
apart, until they disappeared beyond the
reach of telescopes.
As the tide falls the ratchet bar descends
of its own weight, slipping past the doc
when the lever is at the end of the down
stroke. It will be thus seen that no mat
ter how erratic or irregular the rise and
fall of the waves the piston will always
give the same length of stroke in the cyl
inder. It will be pushed "home" witn
every stroke and so compress the air to
the greatest density.
The handling of the compressed air is of
course no part of the wave motor. The
air is forced from the pump into a tank
where it is stored until needed. From the
tank it is only necessary to connect an or
dinary steam pipe with an ordinary -team
engine and the proper valves to be ready
to uevelop pjwer. 13y opening the valve
in the usual way the compressed air passes
into the engine the same as steam and
causes it to revolve. It has b?en conceded
that air is better for this purpose, as tnere
is no waste, no matter how far it is car
ried in the pipes from tank to engine.
Change of temperature also has no effect
on iv
Mr. Schombere has put his working
model to ev*ry possible te*t. He has tried
it in the bay at North Beach and it worked
perfectly, even when iarge waves came in
and washed all over it. The piston gave
about thirty strokes a minute and de
veloped enough power to continuously
run a small steam engine.
The mechanical parts of the larg9 ap
paratus that is to be built near Santa
Cruz are now being made at the Union
Iron Works. There will be several tons of
iron and brass In it and several receiving
tanks for the compressed air. According
to the most careful calculations this ap
paratus should develop been 50 and 63
horsepower. In case it is successful a
number of them will be built at different
points along the coast.
The SWeet, Sad Years.
The sweet, sad years, the sun, the rain,
Alas! too quickly did they wane,
For each some boon, some blessing bore;
Of smiles and tears each had its store,
Its checkered lot of biiss and pain.
Although it idle be and vain.
Yet cannot I the wish restrain
That 1 liad held them evermore â
The sweet, sad years!
Like echo of an old refrain
That long within the mind has lain,
I keep repeating o'er and o'er
'â¢Niithiuit CRn e'er the past restore,
Nothing bring back the year* again"â

Canon Bell, in Leisure Hour.
In 1852 they were seen again aud pre
sented much the usual appearance, ex
cept that their distance apart had in
creased to 1,500,000 miles. They were due
again in 1850 and in 1865, but were not re
i discovered until 1872. wiien they appeared,
| this time in even a more remarkable
manner.
It had long been held by astronomers
that meteors are the remains of old,
broken-up comets whose particles have
been scattered along the former orbit.
Schiaparelli announced it a3 a fact about
18G7, but a part of his theory was laid by
for future confirmation. When Biela's
comet divided in December, 1846, it was
! looked upon as the bezinning ot the end
iso far as this comet wa-j concerned. Ac
| cordingly its non-appearance in 1859 and
1835 was considered as continuing the
theory of its destruction, and further
evidence was furnished in 1872, when the
predicted time of its return came and
went and no comet. Finally, on Novem
i ber 27 of that year, the theory was driven
â  home and clinched by the appearance of a
j most brilliant meteoric display on the day
when the earth in its revolution around
the sun passed the intersection of the oid
comet orbit As many as 33 000 were
j counted at one observatory in six and a
j half hours, and it was by far the most
| striking exhibition of the kind which had
occurred since 1833.
Dr. Klinkerfuea of Gottingen argued
that if the shower were due to particles
from the comet, and there was much evi
dence in favor of this view, the greater
part of ihe remains, or possibly one of the
twins, would be found in the opposite
quarter of the heavens from whicu the
meteors appeared to come. This point
opposite the meteor radiant was too far
south to be visible in his latitude, so he
cabled to the observatory at Madras,
Southern India: "Biela touched earth on
27th; search near Tneta Centauri." Bad
weather prevented a search for two morn
ings, but on the third a comet was found
near the position indicated and only one
was to be seen.
It was ob served for two mornings and
then cloudy weather prevailed aeain.
Two obiervaiions will not determine an
orbit, so that it has not been proven that
this really was the lost comet. Since 1872
it haj not been observed, unless it proves
to be identical witn the comet of 1596
A NOVEL WHEEL FOR TOURISTS
Jhe "Omega," IrWented by William de Witt
of Santa Barbara
William de Witt of Santa Barbara, a
woodcarver and inventor, has studied up
and put together a wheel which be holds
is an improvement on any of the cycle j
family yet turned out to skim the road- j
As he has not yet patented his machine
he refrains from making public the de
tails of bia invention, but states that with
a model which he has constructed he can
attain greater speed at less outlay of pro
pulsion power with it than with an ordi
nary bicycle.
The Omega, as he calls it, Las two 1
large wheels of any diameter chosen run- i
ning side by side, about two feet apart,
with a small steering wheel in front; also ,
with a small wheel behind it. By a pc- ,
culiar device, not yet made known, the I
rear wheel also acts as a brake, which can I
be operated by a slight. change of position
on the pan of the iider.
One of the large wheels revolves on ball- j
bearings, like the bicycle, and its mate re- I
volves with its axle, consequently rower j
need only be applied to one wheel, the in- [
(Perrine), as it will then be known.
The meteors ob*erved in November.lÃ72,
have become scattered further aiong the
old orbit and are observed annually with
more or less recularity. They are known
as Bielids from iheir orgin, or more com
monly as Andromedes, their radiant point
being near Gamma Andromedse The
main sroup is encountered about every
thirteen years on November 27 or 28.
They are rather slow in their movement-,
because they overtake the earth instead of
meeting it almost directly, &i do the swift

leave small trains. A. H. Babcock.
The Pariahs of India.
Tbere is one native East Indian in this
city who was much stirred by the accounts
of India's great famine in the San la^t
Sunday. He is Deva Sundrum, a major
in the Salvation Army. While he is more
interested in saving the souls of his fellow
countrymen than anything else, he real
izes very well that this cannot be dona
unless iheir bodies are fairly comfortable.
"In South India," he said, "I walked
3513 miles, pioneering lifiy-six districts,
visitincr 884 villages and 30.t>39 houses.
In Malayalam, North Travancore, JL
walked 4095 miles. Here I pioneered
twelve districts and visited H531 villages
and 34,71)6 houses. All the people with
whom 1 came in contact on these journeys
were pariahs â that is, the very lowest
caste people. Poor pariahs! They are all
the slaves of the high caste people. To
give an idea of how densely the country is
populated with these unfortunate beinss
there are in Madras Presidency alone
5.1Â«2,0ti6.
"Ttie hoa3ea of the pariahs are never
more than twelve feet square, and tha
sufferings of these people during the
rainy reason and in famine are inde
scribable. They have no homes. They
keep wandering from place to place by
day trying to secure food, and when night
comes they drop down where darkness
overtakes them. Their main diet is a
' scant one of root?. In South India there
are fully 2,500,000 people who do not know
what it is 10 have a single satisfactory
meal from one year's end to another.
Along with the periodical famine comes
cholera. Those weakened by want of
food quickly fall victims to the disease,
and thousands die off every year. When
the plague does break out the Government
sometimes sends along a special medical
officer to carry relief to the pariahs, but ha
is always a high caste, who, instead of
viÃiting the cholera-s'.rioken low caste,
contines himself to visiting those in his
own caste. The result is that the pariahs
are simply swept off the face of the earth.
"Pariahs are always expected to peep at
the respectable distance of ninety feet
from the high-caste people. Indeed, the
public roads are never opened in the vil
lage, since they are only for the use of the
high caste. In certain parts of the coun
try there are special footpaths alongside
all tne main roads. It a pariah should
dare leave these to trespass on the main
road, he would run the risk of losing hi*
life. Oftentimes when the poor creatures
see a high caste approaching on the main
road, he leaves the path, and, hiding far
away under a bush', keeps exclaiming over
and over agnin in a mournful voice, as tha
man passes: 'Master, master, master.'
"When in need of money a pariah goes
to his master and sets a loan amounting
to $5 in American money. But he doe 3
not get this until a bond is signed by the
pariah, in which he signifies his willing
ness to give himaelf to the service of the
high caste for Hie. India is" perishing,
dying. The Government is not able to
cope with the situation. The sanitary
condition of the native quarters tend to
spread the plague, but the pariahs do not
believe this; they think it a visitation
from their godi. The Salvation Army 13

_Â£â  lately about that motto and bad^e.
Now, my dears, I haven't forjotten these
important things. , Oh, no. Why, I have
had my thinking-cap drawn tight over the
top of my head a great many times during
the week in their honor and it will not be

be.
So please be patient with me and you
will not be sorry.
You know we must be very careful and
â  in -ike a wise choice, for the C. R. 0. is the
only club of its kind on the coast and we
are no.t selecting a badge for the present
members alone, but for all the boys and
girls in the future who will read and en

Of course we expect and hope our mem
bership to increase until hundreds of chil

the C. R. C.
How would you like a roll of honor, to
be published on the last Sunday of the

Let me know if you. like the idea.
Now a word to the newsboys of this
great.City, where our paper has its home.
Will not some of you during this com

I am sure all our country members would
be perfectly delighted to have yon do so,
and in a short time you will rind your

country boys, who will tell you lots of
'interesting things about farm life that you
never knew before.
Do not be afraid your writing is too

Tale of Japan.
Here's a song, a happy song,
That jingles with a rhyme,
A simple taie that cannot fail
To please you for a time.
'Tis all about two little folks
Who lived in queer Japan â
A Ty-Foo princess told it me
Behind a tinsel fan.
It chanced that out from Tokio
There rode two little tykes
All dressed in green and yellow clothes
And mounted on their bikes.
Now, as they crossed the land of tea,
The folks from left and right
All left their work and followed them,
To view so strange a sight.
From every house and field they passed
Still more took up the pace,
With fluttering fans and flying feet,
In one long breathless race.
. So .on around the land they sped,
Until at fall of night,
The last of those who ran behind
Came plainly into sight.
So all the people in Japan
In one wide circle met,
And as it seems that no one stopped
They must be running yet.

white and feeble. She had been shut in
this room lor many days now, and with
returning health she longed to leave it
and sec something of the world outside.
When she had cone to bed everything was
dull and flowerless. To-day, propped up
by pillows, she saw a beautiful green
branch barring the window, literally
covered with bright pink roses. They
seemed to smile in at her. Soon she had
to lie down again. It was getting to be so
monotonous, this lying here with nothing
to do. She lay very quietly for a few mo

by a cry: "Oh! oh! Look, Aunt Mabel."
Aunt Mabel rose hurriedly. "W r hat is
it, dear?" she asked, coming to the little
girl's side. "I can see nothing but r few

"Yes; but do you see what they are

that for a well-furnished room?
Twelve children go there every day, big
children and little, with boons just like
those you have, and if you think they do
not study, just you come anil peep through
a crack and watch them.
These twelve pupils never thine their
school is dingy, or that they need any
pity. Nor do I. One small man in the
Revised Second Reader expressed my sen
timents exactly when he said: "I can pet
as many perfect marks in this house as in
any, can't I, Miss M.? '
When the weather is fine, the children
climb the hill at recess and bring back all
sorts of leaves and moss to trim the house ;
and when it storms, the little ones spread
a bug2V-robe on the Boor in one corner
and piny softly while their older brothers
and sisters linish their long problems in
the advanced arithmeiic.
Nearly every year one pupil goes from
the queer little house to the elegant High
School in the town, and the professors
there say they are among their best pupils.
So I think they learn as much in the old
house us you do in your new ones.
Don'tyou think it is the boy that counts
more than the house? I do not believe
any house could make tbe little head
bending closely over the little readsr any
busier or wiser or better. And I think it
is all girl and not a bit house that makes
the "big class" dig so hard over profu and
lcsÂ«.
They are very independent, because
when they need things they go right to
work and make them. They h.ive home
made checker-boards, balls, bats, scrap
books, money, stamps and all sorts of
things. And they can choose sides and
play a same o! ball that would make you
wink. Nor is there a bird or animal on
the flat they cannot tell you more about
than you can learn in a dozen books.
Altogether they are an active, hardy little
bund, and their vertical writing is the
pride of the teacher's heart.
1 do not mean that a nice house and
everything to work wi.h are not pleasant,
but I do think they ar* far less important
than nice boys and good determination to
work with.
Work is the only thing that lasts.
When the little man that gets perfect
marks grows to be a big man he may
stand side by side with a man who studied
in a palace, and who will oare a straw
about it? The question will be, not
"What kind of a house was it?" but
"W at kind ot a man is he?" Don't you
think- so? Olive Heyden.
WATCHING FLIES.

though," she added ruefully.
Aunt Mabel brought the candy and
Ebie put it on an envelope that was lying
beside her. Not big pieces, but tiny
pieceÂ«, smaller than a pinhead. Then
they watched.
"Â£ee!" cried Elsie delightedly. A fly
was walking very excitedly about. "Now
another has joined it, and still another.
Can they see?" Aunt Mabel wondered
aloud. -'They have almost touched it so
many times, and act as if they are hunting
for it, too."
Others were flying about over the en
velope, seeming not to know just what to
do in order to tind the sweet.
"Ah ! ' cried Elsie softly. "One of them
has found a piece at last. He walked
right over it and tnen somehow his little
leg touched it, and see his tongue ! Is it a
tongue. Aunt Mabel? "
Aunt Mabel smiled.
"I don't know anything about the little
creature, Elsie," she said.
There ihe little thing stood as if sucking
the sweetness from the bit of candy.
"He picks it up in his forelegs as a cat

I wjitchtd the creature witli great interest.
â¢Here comes another iittle fellow to help
him eat. Now we shall see some fun."
Fly number two came very near, then
out flew number one's 'oreleg, as you
would raise 11 hand to push away litue
brother if he wanted something and you
were feeling cross, dumber two raised his
hand, too, as we will call it, and there they
quarreled, to Elsie's deli. ht.
"His long tongue is fastened in one end
of t he coveted piece and eaca clings tightly
to it, while their hands are trying to push
each other away," Aunt Mabel informs
mamma, who has entered and is looking
on with an amused smile. "See, Annie, it
is very interesting to watch them, al
though I would not have thought of
it. They are holding it in tho air
now, as if they are trying to pull it
away from each other. "And here comes
N", 3," Elsie exclaims. "They are both
fighting him, It JooKs as if they are all
slapping one another like naughty chil
dren. J ust see all of those little legs going
at once!'
"Elsie, you are too noisy. You fright
ened them and they have dropped the
candy," Aunt Mabel said, laughing
heartily at the disturbance created by the
"THERE! NOW YOU'VE DONE IT."
loss, for the sweet stuff had rolled on the
coverlet.
"It serves them just right forbeir-so
selfish, doesn't it?" asked Elsie. "Eight
een of those tiny legs moving around at
once look funny, doesn't it?"
"Two questions," langhed mamma.
"You are getting me interested in spite of
myself; bat it trie* my eyes to watch
them, so I will just listen to you."
There the eighteen thread-like legs were
moving all over the paper, as if hunting
for the lost treasure.
"Why don't they look off the en-
velone?" exclaimed Elsie, indignantly.
"Now they are getting angry. Number
one seems to think that the others have
hidden it and he is trying to find it."
"No. 2is getting angry also, 1 ' remarked
Aunt Mabel. "See, lie flies here and
there, as if in quite a passion."
"And every time lie passes the others he
gives tlicm a cuff," added Elsie.
"A ciff ?" repeated mamma, looking
incredulous.
"Yes, a cuff," answered Elsie positively
"When he gets near them his hand tlies
out just like ours would, and ha gives
them a cuff."
The ilies soon grew discouraged and
spreading their wings flew away. Only
No. 1 was left, and then the interested
watchers saw something very cute. Have
you ever seen v cat wash her face?
"Well, fiies do much the same. But in
stead of using the hands they press the
whole long leg or arm into service. The
arras meet above his head and he clasps
and unclasps his hands as we do. Then he
rubs them down over his head until he is
satisfied wltb hands and face. Now, Mr.
Fly washes his body with his hind legs.
First he lifts his wings and brings hie hind
legs down over his body a few times be
fore wringing them as he did his hands,
and then he washes over his wings. After
washing the legs again he is done. I have
told you just what Elsie saw that day and
what you may see if you watch these tiny
creatures who act so much like ourselves.
It is now some months since Elsie
watched the flies and she Is quite well,
but she never sees a fly without experi
encing again the Interest that sue felt that
day in the little creature.

was once one of the most hiueous and

THE LETTER BOX
Pan Francisco. Cal., Feb. 9, 1897.
Dear Edihess and Readtrt of the Childhoo'f s
Realm: 1 have of leu wished that I might be*
long to the C R. C. very mnch, and now that I
have the opportunity of doing so I shall take
it.
I wrote a letter to The Call once before and
my letter was published, and ever since then I
have been intending to write again ana have
just got around to it. sinctrely hoping that it
will escape the wastebasket.
Pupa has taken The Call for a great many
years and likes it very much. As soon as I see
the Sunday paper I go for the second sheet,
which I know always has the pago for children
in it. I read everything on the page and try
to solve the puzzles, bu t do not always succeed.
I have had the measles recently ana have been
unable to read the page, but most of it was
read to me, but you know that never comes up
to reading it yourseif, does it?
I enjoy the letters of Retha Waldan, Era
Navone, Clinton Harrington, Maud Mallorv
and Max Sellg so much. It stems just as if
they were my personal friends, though I have
never seen any of them. By the way, I have
Bi-i/n nothing ironi Max Selig for quite a while.
i wonder why he doea not write!
I send In some pu/.z.es, which you may see
at a glance are selected, and hope you will
print them in next Sunday's paper (February
'Jl). With a greeting to the 0. R. C, 1 remain,
Jennie Hills.

Dear F.dilor: This is my second letter to The

thought I would write again, as I had time. 1
live with a lady in llicV Valley. A creek
passes right in front o. the house. One day
thÂ« lady ard I went fishing. We didn't see
any salmon, but we saw a dear little lame lark
in the water. Wo scut the dog in the water to !
catch it. The dog caught the little thing and
ran home and ate it up. Seven little puppies
came to that dog the other day, and she is very

La Jolla, Cal., Feb. 8. 1897.
Dtar Editor : You were kind enough to pub
lish a letter I wrote to Childhood's Realm
while at home in Oregon lust summer, so 1 am
encouraged to send another one.
Mamma and 1 arc spending this winter in
Southern California for our health, and just
now are passing a week with friends at La
Jolla, a beautiful little piace situated about
sixteen miles from San L>iego, right on the
Pacific Ocean.
It is grand to watch the mighty breakers
come rolling in on the beach, and when the
sun shines one can see rainbows in the spray.
The Spanish name. "La Jolla" (pronounced
La Hoya). means "'The Gem," and it is very
suitable, too. There are some beautiful caves
here, and ihc cliffs are worn by the waves into
many fantastic and wonderful shapes. One
larpe hollow rock looks like un old church,
and is culled "Cathedral Rock." Mamma took
my picture at the further end of the opening,
with the sea for a background. One place on
the cliffs is called Goldfish Point, and yon can
look down into thÂ«j clear water and see dozens
of these bright fish swimming about.
A few days ago we visited tne famous aba
lone beds. It is such fuu to turn the rocks
over and find the little creatures clinging to
them. One has to be very quick nbout captur
ing them or they will crawl off. We also found
many pretty varieties of shells, s-a moss and
starfish, wnich we will take home for our
cabinet. Hoping my letter is not too long, I
remain your loving reader,
(11 years old.) BIUTUU Pengstackex.
Pan Francisco, Februnry, 1897.
Dtar Editor: 1 was so surprised at seeing
my letter published that 1 thought I would
write another. I think I will tell you this
time of my home. It is a small cottage situ
ated on the slope of a hill surrounded by
banks of green grass. In front of the cottage
is a running rosebush which shades ',he house
in summer. I have many plants and flowers
hanging on the porch. About three steps
down I have a little garden patch in which I
have planted many kinds of pretty flower
seeas. I hope they will be up by next month.
I also have r little water-fountain by which
all the creeping vines are sprinkled with
moisture.
We have a fine view, being able 1o see from
Golden Gate to the Maritet-street ferry, and on
a very clear day our eyes can gaze on the op
posite shores all the way from Oakland to
fcfuisallto. '.
Now, I'll tell you a little about my pet cat.
He is black and white and has very long ears
and a long tail. His eyes are yellow and he
has ten baby teeth in the front part of his
mouth. He is very active in jumping and run
ning. I call him Cor be because he is a
great fighter and always wins. At one fight ho
won a prize of a large sum of money. Now the
last thine I have to say about him Is that he
loves to eat better than he does to do anything
else, and I'm sure would eat ail day long if he
would be allowed to. ,
I liked the picture of the little bay and girl
skating, but they did not look so merry as our
San Francisco boy on his roller skates. Wish
ing much success to The Call in its new
building, I remain your constant reader,
Katie Meade.

Dear Editreu and Readers of the C. R.C.:
Now as the snow is tco soit to slid? and still
falling. I will merely look out or the window
once in n while as I write. I should like you,
that have never seen much snow, to come up
here some winter. lam sure you would enjoy
it very much. So far this winter we have not
had much snow, but by the looks outside just
now I think it will soon be deep enough for us
to enjoy ourselves with sleds and snowshoes.
I promised to write a nice long letter about
this part of the country in winter, and shill
do so as soon as our dear editress can find
space to print it. With one more look out of
tne window Â»v the bis; snowflakes I shall close,
laid not send any valentines this year, but
received two. What has become of our friend,
the lighthouse boy? I wrote to him nearly a
month ago and did not receive any answer,
and have not seen his name in The Call since.
I hope to see this letter in next Sunday's pa
per. Your little Render,

intent. His terror is increased when he
recognizes his worst enemy peering at
him through the fol is of a hideous black
flap; that means "no quarter."
It is an ordeal that rarely comes to an
eldeily, sedate coyote.
Forne of the tricks of this little, insic
nihcant-looking creature are interesting.

witn an innocent, far-away look of indif

up in the air. His pace gradually in
creases, the awkward geese begin lo mass
toward a common center and try to ful.ow
his movements by turning their heads;
they forget to fly as the wily animal nar
rows bis circie and increases his pace.
Suddenly the coyote is seen flying up the
Liliside, and lirmly clutched in his strong,
bharp teetb is a helpless goose, too dizzy
to fly.
In the foothill ranches in early days the
rancher protected bis poultry against wild
animals by covering the trunks of trees,
in which the chickens roosted, witn old
tin. But when, as in one case, the hen
disappeared just tne same, the old rancher
sat up one moonlight night to see how it
was done. He saw Mr. Coyote slowiy cir
cling around the tree, juifcuing the same
tactics which secures him a fat coose.
Presently, down tumbles a ben, her cap
tor closes his teeth on her neck and is off
like a flash.

I p in the Sierra foothills I once lis
tened to a coyote concert that made the
-uinmer boarders at a lonely ranch thank
ful for a lighted bouse and companion
ihip. A horse was accidentally killed aim
the carcass was le.'t in a meadow about
half a mile west of the house. That sam
evening, while the children were out i
the yard playing, a cry, or rather a serie
of cries, howls and wails suddenly floated
down from a hill to the ea.-t of the hcu>e
The ch.ldren flew into tlie house, decla:
ing that it made "coid streaks run up am.
down their lacss to hear all the grizziii-.
and screech owls crying at one?."
Our old ho.-t came in and said, "It "t
kiotys; come out and hear 'em sine."
The great watchdog, fiercely barking,
bounded up the hill, only to be greeteu
with sharpscreams of detiance, .and thei.
dend silence as he neared the lines of trees ;
lie trotted leisurely back, confident that lu
had quelled the outbreak, but, as ht
reached the house, that weird chorus brokt
out again, and the dog, by this time in a
rage, went tearing niadiy up the hill, only
to repeat his former experience. So the
contest went on until midnight, snaps,
Bnarla and blood-curdiing cries from the
tantalizing creatures on the hill, and
from tne baffled dog savage barks as he
vainly protested ogain-t an invader who
was able to outwit his every move.
The next morning our old host ex
plained the unusual entertainment, for it
was the only time during a stay of two
months that we heard a coyote.
"I've been out to the raedder and there
a;nt nuthin left of that horse but the

Some years ago a white coyote wav
| nd in the foothills wedged between two
â  'â ^s. The animal was unhurt and was
1 opted to Woodward'-s Gardens in San
*.'ancisco.
The coyote is called a coward. He is
brave enough to lead a forlorn hope!
Think of this little coward (?) calmly
"playing dead" in the pre-ence of his two
most dangerous foes<, man and doc. A
hunter who had slightly wounded a coyote
was much surprised to see it fall perfectly
limp on the ground and apparently dead.
The dogs looked at the coyote and then at
their master with an inquiring expression.
Not. a quiver of the eyelids, not the
slightest rise or fall ot the chest, nor the
tremble of a limb, betrayed this little
creature in his wonderful play of death.
The hunter gently prodded the corpse,
lif'ed the limp legs, but they fell without
a twitch. Then the hunter started slowly
down the bill, taking the dogs with him.
A few feet away, he cautiously turned to
look at the coyote. There was a gray
shadow fleeing up the hillside with a
speed that meant sudden deliverance from
a dreadful death.
The coyote is easily trapped by fasten
ing a piece of meat just out of his reach.
In jumping for the meat his hind feet are
caught in a trap hidden under leave.
What wonderful things the coyote might
tell us if be were ever allowed to speak for
himself. How be eluded the clutch

talks afterwaid.
Native Sons of the Golden West are wont
to indulge in rabbit drives, which is a
ruthless invasion of the coyote's pre
serves.
Hunted, hated, pursued by man and
dog, there is nothing left to the coyote
but to "move on." He suffers the igno
miny of having a price put upon his bead,
which places him on a level with the
bandits of early days in California.
The coyote is the proud possessor of
one gift of which neither man nor dog
can rob him â his wonderful speed. Giv9
him one jump as a starrer and he can
urn on his pursuers with fine sarcasm
and ask, "\Vhy don't you catch me?"

Here Is the Auto-Car Which Promises to Be a Dangerous Rival of the Bike
fIp.HE bicycle will have a potent rival
Cl ri V on Ine Continen- this coming season,
â /*!?* for the tov.r.st now promises to trke
to the auto-car and leave the c, -de to rust
and dÂ»cay. There is in London an organi
zation known as the Motor-car Club, and
ts members are devote:! to the one idea of
developing and popularizin in every Â«'ay
possible those curious inventions which
are like and yet unlike the horseless car
riage. Dr. Carl Seeliz. a leading club
member, who is the tourist's guide, phil
osopher and frier, d, has taken up the mat
ter of motor-car excursions nnd will devote
his time entirely to the project this next
senÂ«on.
The auto-car which he has in view lor
general use by the tourists is seven horse
power and will carry six people. Dr.
Seelig declares that it will go up hill and
down dale faster tl p.n any team of horses
can travel, and beside*, all danger of a
runaway will be avoided. Thi< auto
car will be fitted up In a luxurious man
ner and will be of sutticient size to accom
modate cix persons, or at a pinch seven,
though the former number is the one
which the constructor of this autocar cal
culated upon.
There was a quiet experiment made last
year with one of these vehicles, although
the invention had not been perfected to
the extent it is at present, and ihe result
was surprising. It is almost like having
your house along with you. A stop could
be made at any time and no one had to
stay in the car to hold the horse.
It was demonstrated on the trial trip of
the machine la*t year that the great fear
of both the inventor and the builder was
in no danger of realization. It was be
lieved by both of the gentlemen mentioned
that whiio the car would move briskly
along on roads that were fairly decent,
when it came to genuinely rough travel,
such as tourists who traverse the Conti
nent must of necessity often experience,
tne greatest difficulty would be found in
making progress, bo the car was taKen to
Switzerland and from there to France
through the passes and over the rough
roads with which the country lying on the
borderland of the two nations abounds.
What was tho surprise of the four per
sons occupying the vehicle, all of whom
had made the trip before by other con
veyances, 10 find that locomotion was
easier and attended with much less danger

Where Abject Vice Gives
Place to Honest Womanhood
T^ADY HENRY SOMERSET is en
|-Vk gaged in developing a class of new
Iâ7 women which is likely to have a
marked effect on the part of the world in
which they reside. This fact is clearly
demonstrated by the rep >rt of what has
been accomplished during the first year of
the Industrial Farm Colony at Duxhurst,
Encland, the only colony of the sort in
the worldâ the only farm colony which is
ruled by a woman and populated by her
own sex.
The orieinal cause of the inception of
the project whose fruition has been bo
grateful was the fearful prevalence of the
love of liquor among the women of Eng
land located in the cities, who belonged to
the worKing c^ass. For many years it has
been the custom in England for a labor
er's wife, for the wife of the artisan to in
dulge in her pot of " 'alf ana 'alf" without
criticism. It is this practice that brought
about the state of affairs lamented. Lady
Henry, as the chief of the temperance
movement in England, thought out a way
in which the women who had succumbed
not only to the influence of drink no far as
becoming greatly addicted to it is con
cerned, but who had, by their love for
liquor, fullen to the lowest depths.
The plan to which the philanthropist's
fertile mind gave birth was the Industrial
Farm Colony. There were croakers in
plenty who prophesied all sorts olevil and
the direst of failure?. Happily, they have
all proved false prophets. How thoroughly
so is demonstrated by Lady Henry Som-
erset herseli, who has made this statement
concerning the work of the institution
which she planned and caused to be es
tablished :
"It is encouraging to believe that we. at
an y rate, are feeling our way toward a solu
tion of the difficulty that has vexed us
sorely â how to deal with our drunken
than when they had traversed the country
at the mercy of the diligence. These
things were kept quiet until this season,
but now those who experimented are re
lating their experiences lo all who care to
listpn, and the re3tilt has been that Dr.
.'"eelitr, a ter making a series of experi
ments, has reached the conclusion that he
will devote his attention to the auto-car,
because convinced that by means of it the
tourist can really see the country to better
advantage and with infinitely more en
joyment than by any ether means yet
devised.
The first of these tours, Recording to
iresent plans, is to lie made in June, and
will em h race England and Wales. Among
the mountains of the latter sections of
Britain the auto-car will receive as *evere
a test as it did last season. Dr. Seelig has
induced six younn ladies to tnke tfco trip
and he will accompany the car on horse
back. One of the young ladies will be
taught how to manage the vehicle, for
that part of it is simplicity itself, and so
it will be in a way, an excursion of new
women, although under the protective eye
of man. The accompanying illustration
shows how the excursionists will appear
when sealed in their queer vehicle and
spinning along the roads of the tight little
isle.
The one question which threatened
heretofore to prevent the auto-car from
becoming popular as a vehicle for persons
of ordinary means is that of expense. It
lias been believed and openly stated here
tofore t at the invention would cost a
largs sum of money, and that it was im
possible to make it less expensive. Now,
however, there has been a revolution in
the opinion of the makers of the cars.
They fay that so lons as present prices for
material and labor rule, there will be no
difficulty in making a complete auto-car,
and placing it on the market fully
equipped at a cost far below that of the
ordinary carriage. The word ordinary is
used advisedly, the hiph-priced carriage
not beine meant.
This biatement has filled the bicycle
dealers with alarm, as' now a faniiiv can
purchase an auto-car and utilize it for lit
tle more than the cost of a high-grade
wheel. The auto-car can be used by one
person or half a dozen, as may be de
sired. It is not difficult to keep in repair
as its construction is not at all compli
women. The spirit of reform is in the air ;
it affects all our viÂ«ws and must necessa
rily soon alter our methods. We have hith
erto relied on penal treatment, now we
are beginning to see that we need educa
tional methods. The prison has failed as
a deterrent to the habitual drunkard, but
we believe the hospital will succeed, and
it is essentially on the lines of a hospital
that we have opened our work. Our
medicine is fresh air and hard work, kind
ness, sj mpathy and above all the atmos
phere of home. We have found that the
outdoor employments in whica most of
onr patients are engaged have a curiously
exhilarating effect, both mentally and
physically, and the trim forcing-houses,
neat gardens and well-grown fruit and
flowers testify to the power of women to
carry out this work with a large measure
of success.
"The hothouses, which have been from
first to last cared for entirely by the
women, have done so well this first year
that we are justified in erecting other
buildings on the same plan. The enthu
siasm the gardening has awakened among
those who are engaged in it is another
hopeful sign. Our women were as intent
on sending their crop of early vegetables
to the London market as any professional
market-gardener in the land, and ai proud
of their handiwork.
"I was speaking a few days ago to the
medical man who visits us periodically,
and he told me that he could not have be
lieved that tuch good physical results
could have nttended the treatment given
to the patients at Duxburst. He hud seen
women r hose heal h seemed to be perrna
nen.ly in jimd entirely recuperated with
in a few wt eks, latent disease overcome in
others, and n*Â»w health nnd vitot restored
to them. Specially successful has been the
system of dividing the patients into little
cated. It is safe, so those who have used I
it claim, and there is no danger of ex- !
plosion. So it is not at all improbable '
that before many months the bicycle girl !
will have boen ovoluted into the auto-car '
groups, each circle occupying its own par
ticular cottage with a nurse matron at its
head. The institutional spirit has been
entirely removed in this way, and the
pride that the women take in 'our little
homes,' as they call them, is testified by
the spotless cleanlinesi of the interior of
ea< h dwelling.
"The great difficulty hitherto attending
this ieforni wort has been that when
women are dismissed from 'homes,' the
first day of freedom seems to bring with
it also the first struggle against tempta
tion; but I have a strong conviction that
this course is a mistake and that the moral
nature of the woman should be strength
ened by desrees in order that she may be
prepared to meet the trial which she must
necessarily face when sue goes out from
our midst
"Joy is a necessary part of healthful
life, and it was a problem to us how we
could bring it to women isolated from
their familieÃ and burdened with a bitter
past; but the children have answered
this question for us. They come to us
from the London slums for a brief, bliss
ful Holiday, and we make a point of taK
ini: those who are so poor that they are in
eligible for tho children's holiday fund.
Tins home is cared for by Sister Kathleen.
She has made children's work a special
study, and has written several most inter
esting accounts of her experiences at the
Bird's Nest.' "
Of all the work which Lady Henry has
accomplished in the cause of temperance
there is none whicn has shown such bene
ficial results, as far as that section of the
t>ublic which she strives to reach is cott

BRAIN CELLS IN THE FINGER TIPS.
Eyes in the Tips
of the Fingers
Â£fr%!fjy addition to our knowledge of the
.-lalrV anatomy of the hlitiii has just b en
J^J^t made by Dr. S. Millington Miller.
Every one knows that the blind man is
in a small degree compensated for the
want of sight by acute sensibility in the
finger tips. The fingers of the blind can
never see, bat with practice they come
pretty near it. They can read raised let
ters with inconceivable rapidity, and they
arrive at exact measurements of form
simply by passing their lingers swiftly
over the contour ol an object. Sanderson,
the blind professor, could detect a spuri
ous Roman coin by feeling it over care- â¢
inlly with his lingers. A smart blind man
can read character by touching the hand
of a stranger. By the combined senses of
touch and hearing he can form a shrewd
idea of the stranger's age, temper, ability
and stature. Chris Buckley once said that
he could always tell a man's age by hold
ing his hand and letting him talk for a
moment. There have been blind weavers j
whose touch was so keen that they could J
weave a rug of colored wools embracing j
every variety of scroll work, and blind j
mineralogists who could identify a speci
men by the feel.
Whether the blind can tell colors by the
touch has always been a disputed ques
tion. A very intelligent blind official of a j
blind asylum once said: "I know the dif
ferente of colors because I remember
them, but I can't distinguish them by
touch, nor do I think that any blind man
in the world ever could or did." Blind
people in the schools can tell the color of
their rods, but they do so by putting their
tongues to them, and distinguishing tlio-e
which have been dipped from t ose whicn
have not. Indeed, the closest scrutiny
has failed to detect any difference of tex
ture between a piece of cloth or paper j
which has been stained red and another
which has been s'.ained green. Locke's
story that a blind man told him the feel
of scarlet was like ihe blast of a trumpet
is obviously a flight of fancy.
Prescott, the blind historian, once said
that a blind man's knowledge of things
which were within his grasp was more
thorough than that of # a man who could
use his eyes; but objects at a distance lie
not only could not see, but could not con
ceive, nor could he realize their working.
Holman, the blind traveler, exalted in the
rush of stimulating air when he stood on
the top of Adams Peak in Ceylon; but as
he could not see the foggy depths all
round, ho could not ba made to under
stand the consequence of a false .*tep. His
eye did not see, and therefore bis mind
did not fear.
Still, the blind man's finger tips are ao
far superior in sensitiveness to those of the
man who sees that the contrast has pro
voked inquiry among anatomists. Dr.
Miller umtertook to unravel the my?tery
with Bcalpel and microscope. The inner
surface of the index and middle fingers
oi the corpse of a blind man were carefully
sliced off, and sections of perhaps a six
teenth of an inch in thickness were placed
under a powerful microscope. In these
numbers of Pacini's corpuscles were dis
covered. (For the benefit of the non
medical reader, it may be explained that a
Pacini's corpuscle i 9 the infinitesimal
body or atom in which a nerve ends.)
auto-car. It has Jong been considered one
of the coming adjuncts of the armies of
the world, and now is to be the means of
wnirling the pretty Â«irl over highways
and byways and in all countries.
Starting from these corpusce , a complex
ramification of nervoas filaments spread
in every direction, lika twigs in a thickly
branched tree. In the ordinary finger a
single nerve extends to the lip, with a
few branches at the extremity, each of
which ends in a corpuscle. In the blind
man's linger the branches were past
counting, and they began to be thrown off
from the main nervs long before the ex
tremity was reached. It was evident that
the sense of touch in the blind man's
linger was kept in such constant em
ployment that a flow of blood into tho
finger was induced, and the trrowth of tha
nerve system was consequently stimu
lated. Dr. Miller goes so far ns to say
that the Pacini corpuscles are the blind
man's finger-tip bruin, and he implies,
under some reservations, that the finder
tips are eye and mind to the blind, con
taining the same gray matter as the brain.
This theory would imply that the organs
ot perception and reasoning are not con
fined exclusively to the interior of the
skull, but may exist in other parts of
the body, and that Shakespeare may not
have been so absurd, after ail, when he
said that the live, was the seat of lore.
We know a great deal more about the
blind than our ancestors did in the list
century, and yet we have still much to
learn. A popular impression prevails
that when the sight is taken away nature
offers compensation by strengthening the
other bodily and mental powers, so as to
make up for the deficiency. This notion
is unfounded and probably was conceived
in order to mitigate the horror of a hope
less misfortune. There is no reason for
supposing that the other s-nses of the
blind â hearing, touch, taste, smell and
comparisonâ are more acute than in peo
ple who see. On the contrary, incurable
blindness is apt to brealc down botn body
and mind, to destroy hope and spirit, and
to lower its victim below the normal level
of humanity. Among ihe rich tender
care and affection often mitigate the
misery of the afflicted, but among the
mass of mankin i a person wo is hope
lessly blind is treated as a helpless infe
rior, thrust into isolation by his infirmity.
He is an incumbrance to be neglected Â«nd
indulged, so that he grows up to be little
belter than the lower animals â vicious,
mischievous, lary, apathetic, crouching
in moral as well as mental and physical
darkness. Poor blind children ar otten
moody, selfish, irritable and discontented.
So far from redeeming their affliction by
a higher development of the other senses
they seem to be drifting into a condition
in which partial paralysis will overtake
them all.
Of course there have been signal excep
tions â Mi. ton, Sanderson, Dandolo, Zisca,
Gower, Moyes, Salinas, Huber, James,
Stanley, John of Bohenm, FieMing,
Arago, Fawcett and otners â whose career
demonstrates the truth that the loss of
sight does not necessarily and in all cases
impair the quality of mind. But the vis
itor to our modern blind aÃylums cannot
avoid the conclusion tlrot as a rule blind
ness impairs all tbe faculties and that if
thers is anything in D . Miller's theory of
a branch brain in the finger tips it ought
to be studied with a view to the develop
ment o; its possibilities.
For it must be remembered that in the
science of mind and the nerves we are
still groping in tbe dark, and those of us
who see best do Dut see through a glass
dimly.
Not long ago Dr. Hammond, who knows
more tban anybody upon the connection
between rni'id and matter, said in a pub
-1 c lecture that he diet not tnow what a
mind was, but he had a vague idea that
its manifestations, as embraced in percep
tion, intellect, emotions and will, were
dependent upon the operations of cells of
gray nerve tissue, which are chiefly found
in the brain but are likewise present in
the spinal cord, the heart, stomach, Jungs,
liver and other organs. Not to the brain
alone do we owe the evolution of mind;
the sympathetic system of nerves is also
concerned in its production. The pri
mary manifestion of mind is perception,
wdich, in the case of things seen, is per
formed primarily by the retina of the eye,
from which it is conveyed by the optic
nerve to the ganglion and thence to the
gray nerve tissue in the brain. But if
there is a gray nerve tissue in the finger
tips and this can receive impressions of
outward objecs through th- sense of
touch, -mind can be set to work without
assistance from the brain, and the latter
may for the moment abdicate its cogni
zance or superintendence of the actions of
the body.
Hero is where the theory of a brain
finger tip may perhaps Do turned to prac
tical account. Blind people acquire ex
treme sensitiveness In the ends of their
fingers mechanically by exerting an in
voluntary instinct. Suppose the faculty
which comes to them almost without ef
fort were cultivated by education. Micros
copy has shown us that ther-- is an
extraordinary development of the nervous
system in the fingers of the blind, and
that the nerves are centers of gray matter.
Would it be possible to cultivate the sen
sitiveness of the skin so as to increase its
perceptive capacity? If that could be,
done, the blind might ba supplied with a
pair of eyes at the ends of their lingers,
not as efficient as natural eyes, but still
capable of seeing mucn within a limited
sphere, and of arresting the tendency of
their possessor to degeneracy and torpor.
We supply the halt and the lame with
artificial limbs, which, if they are not an
adequate substitute for the limbs fur
nished by nAtiire, mill render locomotion
practicable. Why cannot the power of
vision be evolved in a new organ?

THE STAGE
James A. Herne has worked one mira
cle in -Shore Acres." He ha* made us
willing io pay a good round sum a head
for seats, put on our newest gloves and
use them, too, so that if we do no: split
them, at leas: we loosen some of the but
tons in applauding details of domestic life
that we would look on with cold indiffer
ence in the bosom of our own families. At
home we paze on plump, well-browned
turkey and never feel any consumine de
sire to clap our hands, but at "Shore
Acres" a thrill of delight pervades the
whole audience when the turkey is brought
forth from the oven, people gurgle with
joy when they see how crisp and brown
be is and they applaud him as if he were
the Dird of freedom and the emblem of
American liberty. As tue odor of baked
meats is wafted, like incense, all over
tha theatsr, mere may be a few dis
gruntled people who experience the {
disappointed sensations of a hungry
little boy, flattening his nose vainly out
fide the pastry cook's window, bat these
disgruntled ones are so few and far be
tween that they do not count. The r.udi
ence almost to a unit welcomes the turkey
with the joy of a band of hungry six-year
olds clamoring for Christmas dinner.
Another detail of domestic life that
charms none of us at home, but delights
us at "Shore Acre?," is washing the chi.
dren's faces. Materfamilias, and even
paterfamilias, when he condescends to
â¢ pare time for the weakness, can gush and
gurcle and thrill with delight over the
beanteous picture of baby taking his
morning bath, but no one at home ever
rushes and gurgiei and thrills over
washing the jam off Mary's littie
mouth, and the mud stains off
Tommy's little nose. raterfamilias
Siiys, "Great Scott! do those children
always have dirty faces? " and materfami
lias looks tternly at Tommy and Mary, re
marking: "Thos<e chiluren have been
washed three times already this afternoon,
and now I think I will spank them," and
Mary and Tommy howl in concert as they
are led captives to the nursery for a
fourth ablution. No enthusiastic relation
follows to study the details and admire
the beautiful picture presented by Mary
and Tommy having their faces washed.
In "Slore Acres" Uncle Nat washes the
face of one of the children, and people sit
up in their seats and crane their neckÂ« to
gei a Letter view of how he does it. Will
he wash with the gentle rotary motion
that almost reconciles children to the
hated use of soap and water, or will lie
grab the child by tier pompadour and rub
straight up and down, regardless of nose
and lips, as unfeeling nursemaids are in
the habit of doing? For a moment the
excitement is intense, and then comes a
sigh of relief as Uncle Nat holds the child
gently under its little cnin and washes its
little face in a gentle, rotary way that
â would do credit to a certificated masseur.
When tbe little countenance has been
polished into the similitude of a looking
glass, Uncle Nat make 3 the chid blow its
little nose anti the delight of the audience
redoubles. If Uncie Nat v.ere a mission
ary applying a moral pocket-handkerchief
for the first timfe to the visage of a little
heathen, and every member of the audi
ence belonged to Mrs. Jellaby's society
for supplying the lit'le heathen with flan
nel vests and moral pocket-handkerchiefs,
the general satislaction could not be
greater.
1
It woula take the whole Sunday edition
to describe minutely how James A. Herne
has made his audiences think there is no
place like home, when homeliappens to
bo Shore Acres, and no detail of home life
bo trivial as to Le despised. Shore Acres is
a delightfully well-kept farmâ just the sort
of rural retreat that the country boarder
is always seeking and never finds. Its
pies are as large as bicycle wheels, aud the
ea?e with which a child carries
chunks erf them nfcout shows that
they would not cru;-h your toes if you
accidentally let one of them drop; the
Shore Acres celery and its bread are the
whitest and the kettle and tbe teapot the
most hospitable ever seen on any staje,
and you must understand that there is no
property nonsense about them. The
celery can only be cut a fey,- hours beforo
each performance, the bread is not even
boughtâ three for 10 centsâ at a popular
bakery, it is home made; the Kettle bub
bles with real fteam, on a real stove, and
the teapotâ a hospitable bis brown tea
potâis filled with the genuine cup that
cheers, but not inebriates.
I hesitate to say what "Shore Acres"
would be with a property turkey and card
board pies, a kettle that dici not boil and
tea that was onl.v make believe, but I have
a haunting impression that if the silver
wedding dinner was only a Bermecide's
feast mucri of the glory of the play would
have departed, and if the acting was in
anistic "Shore Acres" would scarcely be
a piay at all, or at least it would ne one of
the baldest, most in-ufferably tarnÂ« plays
that an audience was ever called upon to
endure. Do not for a moment imacine
though that it is anything of the .-ort at
the Baldwin Theater. The acting is so
finished and the staging is so care v I
that "Shore Acres" is invested with a
homely realism that gives theater-goers
the illusion that they are gazing into the
actual lives of the simple farming people
who make the play.
Simple and deligtuful as "Shore Acres"
is, it would be too much to predict that
the play will crea'e t c furore her that it
is said to have aron^ed in the East. On tbe
o:her side of the Rockies peopie take their
pleasures sadly, and the neutral tints of
'Shore Acres," would no doubt appeal
more strongly to them than to Califor
nians who prefer to take their pleasures
sparkling, like their climate and their
champagne. In San Francisco, peo
ple care more about teing amused
or moved than they do about weigh
ing a performance from a high-art
standpoint. "Shore Acres" is more ar
tisic than "The O d Homestead," but
it is not so gay. UnclÂ« Nat of "Shore
Acres" is true to himself and to his
simple, honest nature :rcm one end of
the play to tbe olher. The delightful old
firmer of "The Old Homesteau" falls
Irom grace, artistically speakmp, in those
:w\> acts where he go*s to New York to
seek his long-lost son. In some oi the
'â¢turns" â I can call them nothing else â
outside Grace Church he just escapes
making a buffoon of him-elf. His exag
gerated couniry cous-in exploits are not
altogether artistic, but they are amusing,
and box-office receipts have shown that
they are profitable.
"Shore Acres" is written in a graver
key, and Herne has been too artistic to
drag chunks of comedy, and "turns" into
workaday life. The only comedy in the
whole play lies in the little details of do
mestic life that would never be no.iced at
home and in tht quaint human weak
nesses of some of the charactersâ Uncle
Nat's little foibles in the way
of believing he can cook turkey
and cranberry sauce better than the
women folks; the artful devices of
the grass widower to get a "hand-out" of
the turkey when it is cooked, the stern,
unbending orthodoxy of tho 112-year-old
theologian and the abject way in which
the revengeful father wilts when a little,
helpless is put into bis arms â
in this sort of comedy the laucnter lies
Liar to tears. It is true to nature, but it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1897.
does not split the aides of the groundlings
nor deplete their pockets, as more breezy,
insouciant comedy and "turns" are apt
to do.
Herne has evidently -tried to xnako his
play an exact transcription of New Eng
land farm ufe, and has permeated it with
a simple realism that is more Latin than
Anglo-Saxon. His characters are no better
and no worse than the average everyday
people in real life. They eat, drink and
make merry, quarrel and achieve their
love-making in a commonplace way,
as people for the most part are
in the habit of doin^, outside plays and
novels. When they are good they are not
impossibly good, and when they are bad
they are not absolutely horrid. There is
no doubt about the daring of an author
who attacks commonplace characters nnd
treats them in this complex way. Most
modern Englisb-speakine dramatists ?eem
to think ibat from 8 till 11 in the evening
is all too short a time to attempt complex
character-drawing.
There is not a heroic character in
H-rne's play, except Uncle Nat, and he is
ona of I hose quiet, workaday heroes
whom Alphonse Paudet, in his earlier
worts, deliehts to honor. I name Daudet
especially because of all the modern
French writers he has touched, with a
feathery pen, the little human weak
nesses and foibles and the traits
of unexpected self - nbnegation and
heroism that sometime* surge tv
the sur.ace in the most outwardly com
monplace and everyday character.
Modern English-speaking writers are apt
to draw lheir characters with n coarser
pen. Uncle Nat might belong to Daudet's
"Lettres de .Yon Moulin." He is a to
tally different type from the peasants of
Southern France, whom Daudet draws
with a master hand, but "One touch of
fellow feeling makes the whole world
kin," and Uncle Nat's human nature be
neafb his New England shell is something
that Daudet might have drawn.
Herne's playing oi Uncle Nat's charac
ter is as licht and feathery as his draw
inc of it. For my part, the other char
acters, with the turkey and the celery and
tbe property b. by (the only unreal thing
in the play) thrown in, are all pleasant to
see, but they are niiieshows compared to
the attraction of Herne's "Uncle" Nat
Berry. Marie Evelyn.

James A. Herne begins his second week
at the Baldwin to-morrow evening in
"BhvÂ»re Acres."
The next attraction at the Baldwin will
be Fanny Daveni ort, supported by Mel
bourne Macdowell, and a company of her
own. Tliis will be the last time that the
American tragedienne is seen in the Sar
dou repertory, for next season Davenport
is to give up the French dramatist's plays
and give her attention to an American
production. During her coming engage
ment she will present for the first time in
San Francisco Sardou's "Gismor.da." She
will also play '".fedora," 'La Tosca," etc.
Columbia Jheater.
"At the French Ball" will hold the
boards till Thursday evening, when Fanny
Rice will give her first production in San
Francisco of her latest niiihic.:il success,
"A Flower Girl of Pans." It is said to
be the most pretentious and artistic pro
duction that Miss Rice has yet attempted.
It is described as a costume-rotnantic
ruusical-comedy, laid in Paris in the
days of Louis XV, the oeriovi of white
wigs and patches, affording ample oppor
tunny for cosiuming, which is taken full
advantage of.
The period of the "Flower Girl of
Par s" is lam before the Frencn Revolu
tion, and it depicts tbe lives and manners
of la vieille noblesse.

A sensational racing play, never pro
ducsd here before, "The Derby Mascot,"
will be 10-morrow night's attraction at
the Grand. It contain* a number of sen-
SHiional stage effect*, especially stable
and racing scenes. The story of the play
centers about a bright, pretty giri, the
idol of thÂ«Â» track, who is known as the
Derby Mnscot. She dons a jockey's suit,
which, by the way, wili have the colors of
George Kuse'* stables, wins an exciting
r.ice, shoots craj s with Lhe siable-boys,
sings, dances, helps along a pretty love
affair and eventually saves her father's
life. There is plenty of "go" in the play.
A number of specialties will be intro
duced, and Lottie Williams will nil the
star soubrette role.

Charles Klein's comedy, '"By Proxy,"
will be produced to-morrow night. The
plot of the story is as follows: Lord Clan
morgan has arranged with bis old Ameri
can friend, John Bennett, that his son
shall marry Bennett'9 dau.-hter, a bright,
clever girl. The nobleman's son has
secreuy married a woman 01 vulgar origin.
:md when the time comes for him to go to
America to claim his bri â¢!<â¢, he arranges
for an American friend. Winters, to take
hi- place. The two chums arrive in N w
York, the scion of nobility a* the Ameri
can and the American as ihe nobleman's
son. The complications which ensue are
amusing.

The Waterbury brothers and Tcnny are
new musical oddities who will appear at
the Orpheum this week. They pay all
kinds of instruments in all kinds of way?,
nnd their act is said to be musically funny.
Dudley Prescott, the "Human Bra9S
Band," is another importation which will
nppearfor the first time here. Edmund
Hayes and Emily Lyiton will e:ve a new
sketch, the 'Talkative Man," in which
Miss Lytton confines her companion to
just five worils of conversation. The
Finncya and the Pantzcrs will remain; so
will Barney Fagan, who will sum a num
ber of new sonjrs, and Henrietta Byron
will bob on the stage every few minutes
wearing a new dress The Kenfos and Ara,
Zeln and Vora are in their last week.

On Wednesday, March 9, the French
Opera Company, from New Orleans, will
open a thrÂ«-e weeks' season with "Le
Trouvere" (i! Trovatore). On Friday
night the double bill of "Cnvelieria Rus
ticnna" and "La Navarraise" wiil be pre
sented. Tlie latter is a one-aci op^ta by
Massenet, the music of which the French
paper.-* liavo repeatedly pronounced an ex
act pendant of Mascacni's "Cavall ria."
The book is by Julo Claretie and Henri
Cain, and tells a blood-curdling story of
a Spanish girl, who steals into a Carlist
camp and murders the insurgent ieader in
order to win the price set 0:1 his head,
as she wants the money for her wedding
por;ion. Anita finds too lite that her
lover will not s .are in the prctceds of her
treachery, and she goes mad as the cur
tHin tails. One scene, where the camp
tires are displayed through filmy gauze, as
night is supposed to fail, has always been
>l-"kon o: as one of the most striking pic
tures in modern lyric drama, la spite of
its resÂ«-niDlance to the muse of "Caval
leria Rusticana," "La Navarraise" con
tains some characteristic touches of Mas
senei, particularly a serenade, whieli is
the nem of the opera. Ttie work is more
noisy than the "Cavalleriii," as it is
played to a constant accompaniment of
shooting.
On Tuesday evenine, the Ittth inst., a
new light opera, "L^s Nocesrie Je.uinettf."
will be played and on Thursday Keyer's
lyric drama, "Sigurd," will be given is
first San Francisco production. "Sigurd"
is one of ttie works of wbicn the modern
French scnool is rao<l proud. It lends
itself Co a Wapnerian we:;lth of stage ef
fect ami is snid to have been very success
fully produced in New Orleans by thiÂ»
French comiany. Following "Sigurd"
will bo "L' Alricaine 1 ' and Gounod's
"Faust. "

The thild concert of the San Francisco
Symphony Society takes pluce at the
Columbia next Thursday afternoon at
3:30. Mile. Antoinette Trebelli will be the
vocal soloist. It is years s nee San Fran
cisco has heur.l a singer with such pristine
purity and IreshneÂ«B of voice, combined
with such exquisite vocal method. She is
in the very zenith of her powers, unlike
most ol the ureat vocalists heard here
lately, on whom the wear and tear of
opera is beginning to tell.
Gustav Himichs will conduct an orches
tra of nenriy sixty musicians and the pro
eramrae wiil include Berlioz's 'â¢Roman

the fantasia from "Hansel and Gretel."
GraWford and fiis Gritics.
Marion Crawford doe? not blame liim
self or Ins collaborator, nor the Holland
Brothers for the utter failure ot his "Dr.
C.audius" at the Fifth-avenue Theater;
he blames the critics. In a letter to tUe
Heiald the playwright-novelist tells these
gentlemen that his plan* are not at all
affected by their unfavorable verdict ; and
after jabbing them with ihe pleasing
little remark, "Lritics very seldom ex
press the tmbiic opinion in regard to the
merits of a book or a play," he adds:
"We have other plays written, and the
negotiations for producing the next are
proceeding without inlerrupiion. I am
determined to Kain a place as a play
wright, and my success or failure will
ultimately be judged by the public;
neither one nor the other can be predicted
even by the very best of critics."
Tbe New York critics are not arguing
the question of Marion Crawford's failure
as a playwright, they Amply say that
there is not a situation in "Dr. ClnuJius."
thnt the play is nsundramatic as the "City
Directory, â¢' and that the sooner it is
shelved the better for the Holland
Brothers.

"Jim the Penman" will be presented at the

Fanny Davenpor; does not believe in genius.

R. A. Barnet declares that it is quite appro
priate to say an actor "soars to success," for
tbe stage has wings.
Laura Millard, the new prima donna of the
Tivn;i, who is â  favorite in this City, bag been
detained in Boston by illness, and she will ar
rive this week.
Next Saturday afternoon Fanny Rice will
give the last of her series of ladies' matinees,
which have been succe-siully given in every
city along the itinerary, from New York.
The fact that Henry Miller sheds real tears
in "Heartsea>e" h*s caused as much discus
sion in the New York papers as when Clara
Morris' peculiar tuient in that direction was
first discovered.
The subscription sale of seats for the grand
opera season will be held in order to give
those who desire seats for the entire series of
twenty operas the opportunity of securing
the most desirable locations.
"What will the now woman do?" asks R. A.
Barnef, pathetically, "when ;>be discovers that
tbe husband whom she has raised to social
position and on whom she has lavished every
luxury is determined to Â«o on the stage?"
Moritz Rosenthal, the distinguished pianist,
attributes his illness to a dinner eaten in
company with the late William S'einway,
Bfu-r which both were taken ill with typhoid
fevor. He is ol the opinion tnut the hah shell
oysters in the course had typhoid germs lurk
ing in them.
Pauline French, who made her debut as
Celia at the Sutro Heights performance of
"As You Like It," has made a great hit in New
York with tiie Daly company. Sne is playing
Charlotte to A<ia Kenan's Mrs. Poskett in
"The Mtigistiate." The critics are uuanimous
in her praise.
Charles A. Bigelow tells a funny story
about one of the chorus girls in "The Girl
From Paris," who has been persistently and
Consistently !ate in reporting for duty'every
evening f<<r a week past, for which offense
she has been nightly reproved by the stage
manager. Finally E. E. Rice concluded
that it was time for him to discip
line tbe tardy chorister, and summon
ing the Rirl to his august presence
he sterniy inquired: "Now, Mi>s Blank, what
excuse have you for being late so often?" "'Well,
Mr R;ce, my clock teems to bu all wrong,
and whenever I depend upon it being correct
i; aluavs seems to get me here late." "Thai's
iota i:ood reason! Why -don't you get a good
cock?" "i have a good clock, sir, and yon
ought to know it." "What do you mean?
Win-re di-i you get it?" "Why, don't you re
member, Mr. Rice, it's one ot the clocks you
gave as a souvenir of the 150h penormance
ofâ" "That will do. my deiir,"' interrupted
Rice b a idy, "I accept your excu'.e, but don't
lei it occur njjain."

CHICAGO, 111.. Feb 27.â There was little
In the wheat market for either buyers or selle s
this morning. Trade was in an apathetic condi
tion, with prices confined to a narrow range, the
Kencrai average being a trifle over yesterday's
close. An advance of iid at Liverpool and light
Argentine shipments for the week were the firm
ing factor;. American shipments from both
coasts fir the week were 1.372.000 bushels. This
wa-t Â» discouraging f ature adit had a tendency
to check the demand. .Receipts at Chicago were
light at 10 cars, and 42,343 bushels were with
drawn from store. The .Northwest received 230
cars, against 301 last February and 290 a year
ago.
Clearances at Atlantic |.->rti were fair at 299.
--429 bushels. Closing Parts an 1 Berlin cable* were
lower. Antwerp was unchanged. A moderate de

an inclination to cover. Prices th -n advanced to I
the best point of the day. when they rested. May

whs confined to a few small lots and the range of
prices during the nrst hour was but one-sixteenth
of a cent. The tone was fa:rly steady, however,
yesterday's closing figures being maintained. Ke
ceipts were 49 more cars than expected, and 65,892
bushels were withdrawn from store. The exports
from bj!h coasts for the wee*. 4,744,000 bushels,

UNION STOCKYARDS, lix. Feb. 27 âThe
receipts of cattle this month were only 180,1.'.0
heal against 190,147 in the same month last year,
and the receipts for the first two months of 1897
are much smaller than those of recent years, be-
Ing 184.350 less than during the corresponding
period In 1892. The quality of the offerings has
been poorer than ever before, and prices rued
rai her low, though much higher than the abnor
mally ow prices of a year ago. Most kinds are
selling .-.bout a dime lowvr than a week ago, and
heavy cattle hÂ»ve not sold so well the iasi lew
d.-ys on account of the smaller demand from ex
porters, and the dv 1 condition of the Eastern
markets. The feellug was steady to-day, only a
handful being on sale
The February receipts of â  hozs were about
710.000, making 1,474,000 for the first two
months of the year, an increase of 204,000 over
the same period last year, but 191,000 less than
in January and February 1895. Hogs sold ail ,
right this week and packers paid a further advance
of 2Vi to fie per 100 pounds to-day with the view
of bringing in a big suppl/ on Monday.
Fewer sheep are coming to this market than a
year ago, the decrease for the first two months of
Ib9t> being about 26,000 head. There is an active .
demand aud prices are strong. Quotations were
not essentially changed to-day.

BUSINESS REVIVAL
OF KEARNY STREET
The Hub Clothing-Store to
Be Torn Down in
April.
The Heirs of the Adams Estate
to Make Expensive Al
terations.
The Remodeled Building Will Have a
Granite Front and Two Addi
tional Stories Added.
The rivalry for business by the mer
chants on the outside sections of the City,
which had its inception in introducing a
display of electric liehts over the streets,
has acted as an incentive to property
owners in the commercial center to bestir
themselves in keeping pace with the era
of progress which surrounded them. A
failure to do so carried with it the label
ing of their store fronts with that unwel
come sign "To let," which means no in
come on invested capital.
One of the first to recognize that with
out improvements th*re would be no
progress, were the heirs of the estate of
James Adams, who own the corner lot on
the northeast junction of Slitter and
Kearny streets, at present occupied by the
Hub clothing-store.
This property is about to be improved
by a general and thorough remodeling,
which necessitates the tearing down of
the entire front and re-erecting the build
ing, with the addition of two stories, mak
ing it a six-story structure.
The en.tire front on both Kearny and
Gutter streets will be removed to founda
tion mark, upon which a more substantial
buiidinjj will be errcted, consisting of
uranite, with steel pillars and girders to
support the additional weight of the two
stories to be added.
There will be two elevators on the north
ern side â one of whicu will be used by the
tenants on four upper floors, and the
oiher exclusively foi Mie u?e of the ten
ant who has already engaged the base
ment, store and floor immediately over
head.
The entire alteration will involve an ex
penditure of about but this sum is
only a bagatede as compared to other
amounts lately expended in erecting new
bi.ildings.
The Adams heirs saw the necessity of
making a start to improve Keamy-street
property and by so doing retain the busi
ness that rightly belongs to thai excep
tionally located thoroughfare of com
merce and travel.
This improvement, acceptable as it is
from a business point of view, brings with
it some disadvanta eto the tenants. The
chief sufferer by this forced removal will
be the owners of the Hud Clothing Com
pany, who, not expecting such a sudden
Bbift of quarters, had ordered a large
slock of Eastern and fcmropean goods, the
greater bulk of which is in transit for the
spring market.
In spe&King over those disadvantages
Charles Reims, the president of the com
pany, said: "While we are not opposed
to the owners of the property making the
alterations, but on the contrary are
pleased to see such improvements on
Kearny street as will make tne street at
tractive and Keep the business i here, yet
we were taken somewhat by surprise, as
we did not expect to receive notice to
vacate before July, at w..ich time we
â would be better prepared to move, as by
that time we woiud have disposed of the
lieavv stock of spring and summer goods
which we have ordered.
"But now that it has come we must
mate the best of the situation aad get a
'move on, 1 so to speak, and find quarters
sufficiently large in which to carry on our
business even at a sacrifice.
"Of course we have tne consolation of
knowins that we wili again occupy our
old quarters under different conditions.
"We have secured a lease to move in just
as soon as the place is finished.
"Under our new terms we will occupy
the basement, the store and, the entire
floor above us, which will be devoted to
boys' and children's line of goods. We
expect to be back there in six niontns
under more favorable auspices for carry
ing on our iine."
Other improvements in this section of
thÂ« City are in contemplation. It is said
that the large brick building on Sinter
street lately occupied as a plumber's store
is about to be remodeled on lines similar
to those of the Adam* building.
JUNIOR ORDER IN SESSION
The State Council Will Meet in
Sacramento City on Tues
day Next.
The Increase in Membership Daring
the Past Year â Suggestions
That Will Be Offered.
The next annual session of the State
Council, Junior Order of United Ameri
can Mecnanics, will be held in Sacra
mento commencing next Tuesday at 10
o'clock in the forenoon. From the reports
received from trie various counties in the
State the prospects are that there will be
a full delegation of representatives.
Henry C. Schaertzer, the State coun
cilor, will present a very interesting re
port setting forth in detail what he has
aone during the year in his official capac
ity, and he will suggest several matters
for the State Council to act upon, provid
ing the suggestions he will make will
meet with the views of the delegates.
The State Councilor has with one or
two exceptions had first-class deputies,
who have assisted him materially in the
work that he has had to do and direct
and for this assistance he feels very
gratefuL
During the year he granted twenty
eight dispensations, denied 3 because of
non-compliance with the rules of asking
for them, and rendered eight, official de
cisions. He issued warrants for four new
councils, at Eimhurst, at Stockton, at San
Jose and at Alam*d:i.
During the year one council, by vote of
the members, was disbanded. This was
John C. Fremont Council of San Ber
nardino.
The State Councilor during the year
visited every council in the State except
tbe one at Lonipoc and the one recently
organized in San Jose. He is of the
opinion that the visits by the grand
officers of tbe orgnniz-uion have a stimu
lating effect upon the membership of the
*'jborriinate councils and should be en
couraged.
li his report the State Councilor will
recoruruend that in view of the fact that
the work of the State secretary has in
creased in a very marked degree his
ealary be fixed at |300 for tbe ensuing
year; that to prevent any section of the
State being ignored in the matter of annual
tessions the State be divided into three
ections, and that tbe session be held in a
different secuon every year. He will also
make a number of recommendations that
*re of interest only to the members of the
order.
The committee on laws will present a
report that will include a number of pro
posed changes in the laws winch experi
ence has proven can be made for the bet
terment of the order. i'Le committee will
also submit, without recommendauon. â 
number of proposed changes as to ihe
duties ot officers.
During the year the board of officers had
but oneapreal to pass upon.
The reports of the State Council secre
tary will show ihat during the year ihe
order in this State increased 25 per cent,
and that at this time it is in good condi
tion and the membership very enthusi
astic in the worn for which the council^
were organized. During the year there
was paid lor benefits and relief the sum ol
$2641 85. Tne number of deaths was 12.
There are now prospects for the early or
ganization of councils at Vallejo, Grass
Valley and Esconaido.
The National representatives from this
State will present a report of thpir stew
ardship while acting in their official ca
pacity in the National Council held at
Denver, Colo., last June.
The report of the National Council
shown thai during the year preceding the
meeting there was an addition of 142 coun
cils and a gain oi 13,142 members.
A LAWYEK'S TROUBLES.
I Attorney Crltteiulen Will Tell Hig Woes
to Judge lJahrs Next Friday.
The contempt case of Attorney James
i L. Crittenden, who was ordered to pay
1 $250 fine or go 10 jail by Judge Slack for
I wearing a loaded revolver in court while
argumg the damage suit of Miss Emma
Astiley against "Lucky" Baldwin for se
j auction, gave Judge Hebbani another un
! pleasant lialf houi yesterday morning.
When Mr. Crittenden applied to Judge
| Hebbard for a writ of habeas corpus the
writ was granted and made returnable be
fore "the court in bank," but it wag not
i possible to persuade the Judges to hold
; court in bank, and Judge- Hebbard. not
being willing to take the responsibility,
! dismissed the writ and remanded the
prisoner to the custody of the Sheriff.
Mr. Crittenden stated that Judge Bahrs
had expressed a willingness to hear :irgu
ment in the case, so Judge Hebbard at
once issued a new writ, reiurnaole before
! Judge Bahrs at 10 o'clock next Friday
I morning.
FOR A CHILDREN'S DAY.
A Magnificent Holiday Has Been
Proj cied lor Carnival
Week.
Maypole Dances, Hayrides, Picnic
Luncheons and 0 her Delights
for Juv ni es.
A movement was inaugurated yesterday
by a large number of charitably disDosed
, ladies and gentlemen to give the children
of San Francisco a magnificent holiday
during carnival week. The idea is to give
I all the boys and girls who can be gathered
I together at the Golden Gate Park or the
j Presidio a day of such sports as will most i
delight their childish hearts. The move
ment has taken and the inaugurators of
; the suggestion are overwhelmed with
offers of assistance of all kinds. The one
| passport required to the sports that will
| be presented will be youth.
The orphan asylums are to be emptied
\of their inmates on that day. The chil
dren in the hospitals are to be remem
i bared, and such of them as can be taKen '
i out will be brought along, while the sick
i ones will be remembered in such a way
! that their little burdens will be lightened
i lor many a day. The school children of
j both public and private schools of course
I will come. There will be no keeping them
away, because the programme will be bo
very attractive that no child will give its
parent any peace until consent is obtained
| for their participation in the festivities.
There will be a maypoledance, which will
be one of the very prettiest features of the
day. Once upon a time there was a may
pole with its pretty ribbons held by 350
children, but the maypole on children's
I day out at the park is going to have its
i fluttering ribbons twined in dainty colors
Iby 500 dancing little ones. Another idea
of the projectors of this great day is to
ransack all the country for miles around
and secure big header wagons and farm
wagons and descend on the lields of the
farmers and get them tilled with freshly
; cut, sweet, new-mown hay, have them
j drawn by spanking teams of big horses,
j fill them up with troops of merry children
and have a real, old-fashioned hay ride
out to the green sward where the children
are to have their sports and games.
Children of different nationalities will
present the characteristic dances of their
country, because there is a man connected
with the carnival who has traveled all
over the world and seen all these attrac
tive features at other carnivals and is go
ing to show them to the children of fean
Francisco. There will be Chinese babies.
j Japanese babies, Indian babies, in all
| their picturesque costumes, which go so
far to make San Francisco so unique in
point of color and variety of people.
There will also be of course babies of all
other nationalities, and above and beyond
all California babies in all their wealth of
j beauty. This is all to be part of a baby
show â not one or those ordinary baby
shows that you see at all country fairs.
There will be no preparation for this baby
show on the part of ambitious mothers
who desire their offspring to show how
they can lisD the "Carnival of the Golden
Gate" for a prize spoon or some other
article, but it is going to be a most unique
one in its features. Then there is going
to be a luncheon for the children. This 13
j going to be one of the features that
probably will appeal most to the youthful
contingent. This picnic luncheon spread
I on the green grass is going to contain
: every delicacy known to the juvenile
heart, including an abundance 01 cream
Imff-j and aneel cake. Then there will be
music by juvenile bands, songs by the
children and other features that appeal
particularly to childish heart.*.
The ladies and gentlemen who in
augurated this affair promise to make the
I day the most notable one ever enjoyed by
i the chi dren of San Francisco,

DIVOKCE MATTERS.
j Expected Activity for Two Months on
Account of a New Law,
Divorce matters are likely to be ereatly
accelerated in the courts of California
during the next two months. On the 2fJth
of April a new law will go into effect
which will require that divorced people
cannot marry until a year after the sign
ing of the decree. â¢
In addition to haslening present and
contemplated litigation, it i 3 understood
that the new Jaw will affect the interests
j of a great many people who will hereafter
seek to avail themselves of the law which
permits legal separation of hu>band and
wife.
Under present conditions, women with
profligate husbands are able to obtain
divorce, and soon afterward they are re
married, their new mate not infrequently
being picked out before the old one is law
fully disposed of. This state of affairs
will be changed, for few men will be will
ing to wait a year for a chance to marry a
divorced woman..

COLLECTOR WISE
HOLDS ALL OPIUM
An Investigation Regard
iDg Importation Is
on Foot.
Chinese Said to Be Evading the
Laws That Uphold the
Treaty.
Over $300,000 Worth of the DruÂ£ Is
Now Tied Up in the B nJed
Ware Louses.
Consternation reigns in Chinatown and
among the opium dealers of this City
over the action of Collector of the Port
A\ ise in ordering that all of the opium
now in the bonded warehouses of this
City be held there pending further in
structions from him.
The amount of the drug so tied up is
said to be between $300,000 and $400,000
and another big opium scandal is antici
pated before the matter is settled up.
Mr. Wise's action was Jtaken at the re
quest of the special treasury agents now
stationed here and is the result of an ex
haustive investigation that has been going
on for some time.
It may be eventually shown that there
has been no violation of the law in re
gard to the drug, but this can only be de
termined by the courts.
Article 2of the existing treaty with the
Chinese Government prescribes that no
Chinese resident in this country may im
port opium and a reciprocal regulation
exists regarding Americans in China. The
treaty makes this provision "subject to
appropriate legislation."
Prior to February 23, 1887, Congress nad
made no provision to enforce the section
and the Chinese brought in immense
quantities of the narcotic.
In the latter part of 1836 $750,000 worth
of opium in this City was seized on the
ground that it had been imported in vio
lation of the provisions of ttie treaty, but
wns released when it was shown that tne
treaty tiaa anticipated supplementary leg
islation.
Then, on the date mentioned. Congress
passed an act as provided for by the
treaty, and the Chinese censed bringing
in the drug in their own nmneÂ«.
Since that time all opium has been
brought in by white firms doing business
here and has thus lound its way into the
Chinese quarter.
Some time ago a shipment valued at
$200,000 reached this City on one of the
China liners and was consigned to H. K.
Davidson, the accountant of the Bank of
British Columbia. The size of the ship
ment excited tbe curiosity of ibe customs
officials and a quiet investigation was
made to ascertain whether the opium be
â¢ongeii to Davidson or was purchased in
the capacity of an agent for other parties.
1 1 was found that Swayne <fc Hovt,
Custom-house brokers, bad done the work
of getting the opium through and that
the larger portion of i be drug was event
ually transferred to Kwong Fong Tai &
Co.. opium dealers in the Chinese quarter.
Enough evidence was discover eJ to
make a more thorough investigal
tion necessary, and Agents Caleb
West and Lesiie Cultum, who-e
stations are in Washington and Oregon,
wert sent for. Tnev unearthed more lacts
goinn to show that the opium was pur
chased for Kwong Fong Tai <fc Co. from
Rosario & Co., an opium tirm of China,
and that Davidson was merely the agent
who handled tne goods. They even claim
to find a trace of a contract between the
partie?, and at once concluded that the
Chinese were violating the law against im
portation by those of their race.
In order to make sure of their eroiind
the United States District Attorney's oltice
was asked for an opinion, and Assiuan.
Bert Schlesingcr was detailed to render it.
He read the laws carefully and arrived ai
the conclusion that the transaction was a
technical if not a direct violation of tLe
law.
Acting on his opinion the special agents
addressed a letter to the Collector asfcinjj
him to detain the drug until the matter
could be passed on by the United States
courts and he made the order that is caus
ine all the trouble.
The price of opium will probably double
before the question is settled, as the sup
ply in Chinatown is limited, only enough
tx>ing taken out of bond at a time to sup
ply the immediate demand.
It is not unlikely t at if itis proven that
the opium belonged to the Chinese when
it was landed the Celestials will be prose
cuted. It in understood from the reading
of the law that neither Davidson nor
Swayneand Hoy t have been guilty of any
offensp against the laws.
Mr. Davidson was not at his place of
business yesterday and Swayne and Hoyt
said that all they knew about the matter
was tnat thej had cleared the opium at
the request of Davidson end supposed that
the drug belonged to him.
IEEE PDBLIO LIBEAEY.
Addition* That Have Been Made With
a View to Add to Its luefulnegi.
A number of additions have recently
been made in the Free Public Library
which greatly add to the comforts of the
patronÃ and to the usefulness of this al
ready valuable educational branch main
tained at the expense of tne municipality.
A number of new cases have been added
on the upper floor for the placing therein
of a large number of books that are not
frequently called for. Tim will give more
shelfroom on the main floor of the library
for new books that are being constantly
added.
In the reference-room, which every day
is crowded by those in search of data
which is to be obtained from the books
that are stored on the shelves, there has
been added a set of new shelves, whicn
are to be used to accommodate the very
complete rile of Patent Office books and
papers that are to be found in that room.
A map case and desk has also been added
in the room. In the drawers are stored
the rolled maps and the desk in to open
these maps on. Experience has shown
that maps kept in that form are more ac
cessible than those that are hung on a
wall.
The cases that have been placed on the
upper floor and which are to be used to
hold the overflow number fourteen, and
the changes in the reference-room will ad
rait of tiie placing of 1500 additional vol
umes there and then that room will con
tain about 6000 volumes.

JUDGE CAMPBELL
IS THE MOSES
Pure Food Cases Led From
the Egypt of Non-
Conviction.
The Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association Gains
Its Desire.
But it Is Understood That No More
Talk of the "Push" Disturbs
the Breez. 1 .
"I will take them. That ends it.
"Every man brought before me on suffi
cient evidence for violating pure food
laws will be adjudged guilty and made to
pay the penalty. But there must be no
more talk about the push and their in
fluence, or, by the great Causa r's ghost,
every man will go scot free."
The speaker was Police Judge Camp
bell and the occasion a conference be
tween the Police Judges and a committee
of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association in Justice of the Peace
Groezinger's private chambers. Present
were the four Police Judges, Campbell,
Conlan, Low and Joachimsen; the com
mittee, composed of Oscar Lewis, Isidor
Jacobs, A. Sbarboro, A. McLaughlin and
Secretary C. L. Blethin; and J. A.
Filcher, representing the State Board of
Trade; Colonel C. L. Taylor, the San
Francisco Fruit Exchange; Chief Food
Inspector DocKery, for the Board of
Health, and Chief Market Inspector
Davis. Mayor Phelan came in for a lew
moments during the session, but lett
shortly.
Judge Campbell's decisive words were
delivered at the close of a long and, at
times, rather healed argument, on the
subject of securing convictions for viola
tions of the pure-foou statutes. He acted
generally as spokesman for the Police
Judges, while I3idore Jacobs per.ornied in
a similar capacity for the committee.
At the outse: of the argument Jacobs
explained the trouble that had existed in
securing convictions in ihe courts, and
said the committee believed raurli of
this trouble could be obviated by having
all cases come before one Judge. He was
interrupted by judge Campbell with an
indignant query as to whether the advo
cates o! pure food made ttie assertions ac
credited to them by tue press, whereupon
Mr. Jacobs denied the same with an avid
ity delightful to witness, and explained
that reporters were oftentimes very care
less in handling tl\e graphite. In view of
the fact that Mr. Jacobs at various times
has personally appealed to the press to
support the advocates of pure food in
their crusade, his denials were rather pe
culiar.
Judge Low â¢wished to know why the
battle was not made with the jobbers and
imnorters instead of the retailers, who
could not open each can of food to see if
it were pure. He was willing to take his
share of cases, but would not handle all.
The retailers, the men who actually sold
the food to customers, were the men that
ctime under Judge Joacbimsen's censure,
and he believed the right men were under
ttre. He was also unwilling to taKe all
the cases.
Judpe Conlan asserted for himself and
confreres thnt all cases in which men
were discharged from custody after being
brought up for violation of the laws in
question were due to a lack of evidence.
Then it was that Judge Campbell arose
in all his dignity and with a contempla
tive stroke of the hirsute growth that has
won him State fame as a human JE:>lian
lyre delivered himself of the words which
introduce this artic:e. By so doing he
voluntarily took upon himself the Mosaic
effic of leading all pure-.'ood cases out of
the Egyptian land of non-conviction and
into the promised land of justice.
Nothing m>ire remained to be said.
Common congratulations were exchanged
and all departed m peace, Judee Camp
bell's face shining with a beatific light at
the thought of his great coup.
Coffey and >mith Are Guilty.
Tne Supreme Court has denied the writs of
habeas corpus app.ied for by Attorneys J. F.
Coffey and J. F. Smith. These attorneys were
recently adjudged guilty of contempt of court
by Police Judge Joaqhimsen in the Chinese
giimbltr cases and sentenced to pay a line of
$100 and serve twenty-four hours In jail.
They applied to Superior Judge Wallace for
writs of habeas corpus, but were there denied,
hence the application to the Supreme Court.
Coffey and Smith were out on bail, but upon
the denial of the writ they were taken into
custody by the Sheriff, and irom all appear
ance they will be compelled to submit to tne
punishments inflicted by the Police Court
Judge.
