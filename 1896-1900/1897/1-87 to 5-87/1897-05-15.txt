Refusal to Consent
Until Dhomoko Is
Taken.
SO THE HOSTILITIES ARE
RESUMED.
While Edhem Pasha Is Closing
on Constantino the Greeks
Fight in Epirus.
SEVERAL MINOR VICTORIES
ARE REPORTED.
So the War Will Probably Be Con
tinued Several Days More
at Least.
[Copyrighted. 1897, by the New ors Sun.]
LONDON, Eira , May 14.â 1t is now evi
dent the powers do not possess the con
trol of the Sultan which was assumed in
many quarters would speedily bring an
end to me hostilities as soon as Greece
sought their mediation. The Porte
virtually refuses to consent to an armis
tice until the Turkish troops shall have
Dhomoko, where ihe Greek headquarters
in Thessaly are now situate 1. The Greeks
have given vim to the campaign in Epirus
by their spirited advance, which has al
ready caused severe fighting.
The war will probably continue In
serious fashion for several days longer in
both Thessaly and Epirus. Evidence
is lacking, however, of any general re
vival of the esprit de corps ot the Crown
Prince's army, and further easy successes
for Edhem Pasha are expected. These
succe-ses will further increase the em
barrassment of the powers, which is al
ready great. The fact is the Sultan U
quite out of hand. His apologists say he
would be clad to acquiesce in the wishes
of tiie powers, but me military party in
Constantinople is too strong for him.
Tnis is a convenient explanation, but the
Porte is master of the situation short of
actual coercion by the powers, which has
not yet been thought of.
The latest version oftnePorte's demands
is that Turkey will get Thessaly in ex
change for Crete, which the powers may
givi to Greece if they choose. It is hardly
possible the concert wiJi consent to this,
and Greece is not i;K3ly to submit though
she is almost helpless in the present po-i
--tion. It is beginning to be realized in
Athens that the Greek interests would
have been vastly stronger if the Govern
ment iiad negotiated direct with the Porte
instead of calling upon selfish mediators,
who wiil seek only their own ends. The
powers realiy made war by preventing
Greece from settling her own difficulties
and are now continuing it when both
belligerents would be glad to come to
terms.
It is pretty evident now that when a
settlement is reached it will include some
of the so-called rectification of the Tbes
aalian frontier, despite the opposition of
England anaperl.apsFrar.ee. This means,
of course, that Greece will kse a s'.ice of
territory. The Government organs of the
English press are already preparing public
opinion for thi-< fresh demonsiration of
the impotence of Great Britain in Euro
pean affairs. There is cynicai amusement
in the fact that those English enemies of
Greece are now earnestly hoping for a re
vival of her arms in order to break (he ob
stinacy of the Sultan and preserve the
present map of Europe.
GREEKS ARE GAINING.
They Capture Nlcooolis, Besiege
Prevesa and Bombard tha
Town of Actum.
ATHENS. Gbeece, May 14.â The Turk
ish army under Ed hem Pasha is reported
thisrurrning to be marching upon Dlio
nioko and that it has already occupied
live villages on the way. To-night a dis
patch from Dnomoko says the Turks are
re iring to Pharsala.
General Smolenski telegraphs that the
Turks are in strong force near Almyros,
and he expects they will attack him to
morrow.
Arta advices show that a desperate
bailie has oeeu raging all day between the
Turks and Colonel Baractario's Greek
brigade in Epirus. The fighting was
stopped by darkness :o be resumed to
morrow. The Greek loss thus far has been
400 Killed. The Turks have scarcely any
artillery. The Greeis are strong in artil
but have been unable to use their
guns as they are fighting at close quarter*,
The town of Freve>a is closely beseged
by the Greeks, who are also bombarding
Actium near the entrance of the gulf of
Arta frcm the sea. Tne Greeks nave
captured the town of Nicopulis. a few miles
north of Prevesa, after desiroy:ng the
Turkish batteries. The Greeks have oc
cupied Filiippiada.
CANEA, Crete, May 14. â Five hundred
< >reek troops sailed for Greece to-day and
otuers are embarking. It looks as if the
whole army of occupation i* going. The
'retans ruaka no opposition to their de
parture. The foreign admirals at the
request of Colonei Statkos, the Greek com
niauaer, have withheld the issue of the
announcement that Greece nas abandoned
the idea of annexing the inland. Such
announcement will nol be issued until all
tlie troops have gone.
LONDON, Exg., May 11â The Athens
The San Francisco Call
correspondent of trie Times reports on in
terview with Ralli in reference to the ac
tivity Of the Greek forces in Epirus. Ralli
said that untii an armistice is announced
Greece retained liberty of action, and the
Government could not allow the
activity to be confined to Thessaly,
where the Turkj were preponderant. It
bad done what it could to obtain a truce,
anti pending an arrangement it must act I
when and wiiere it could. It abstained
from action in the Jvean Islands and
elsewhere only for the sake of the Greek
population.

Yesterday by the Greek Fleet.
The view is from a point on the opposite side of the strait?, near the Greek
fort Fnnta, a mile distant, and takes in the southeastern or greatest water front of
the city. To the left is seen the old Fort St. Giorgios, recently repaired, with its
Turkish standard nyinp. To the right is Fort Paleosaragos, and between'the two is
the principal mojque of the cily, the Cutom-house and some of the business
places. In the background are the hills, on which lies the ancient site of Nikopo

the Greek troops from Arta.
the President. The sentence of the court
Is dismissal from :he service. General
Merritt, as commander of tne Department
of the East, had no authority to act in the
Romeyn case because of the sentence im
posed, and his action in sending all the
papers here was compulsory. The case
will be taken up by tne President soon
after his return from Philadelphia. As
Komeyn will retire on June 1, it is be
lieved here the sentence will be mitigated,
in view of Romeyn's long service and ap
proaching retirement.
ATLANTA, Ga., May 14.â There is a
disposition in army circles to refuse to be
lieve tnat Romeyn will be dismissed. His
friends and senior officers at the barracks
cite his lone and brilliant record in tha
Civil and Indian wars.
The story of the scandal at Fort Mc-
Pherson, which has resulted in the sen
tence of dismissal from the service
of Captain Komeyn, has awakened in
terest all over the country, and the pro
ceedings of the court-martial have been
widely published. Fort McPherson is a
po^ situated four miles from Atlanta,
where the Fifth Infantry, under the
command ol Colonel Henry C. Cook, has
been stationed for several years. A little
more than two months ago Captain
Henry Romeyn was summoned before a
court-maraal to answer charges preferred
against him for conduct unbecoming an
officer and a gentleman. There were
three specific charges. The first of these
was based upon his having knocked down
Lieutenant M. J. O'Brien on February 17
laat. Tne two others charged him with
circulating unjust and scandalous report
about Lieutenant O'Brien's wife. The
active characters in the drama were five
in number. Captain Romeyn became
mixed up in it as the father of Miss Nina
Romeyn, whose engagement with Lieu
tenant Bamford of the game regiment was
broken off because of the alleged com
promising attentions of Bamford to Mrs.
O'Brien. Lieutenant O'Brien became in
volved when he publicly resented Cap
tain Romeyn's strictures upon his wife
and demanded an apology.
Capiain Romeyn is an officer of reputa
tion. He served during the War of the-
Rebellion, having entered the service as a
private in the One Hundred and Fifth
Regent, Illinois Volunteers, in 186.', anu
being mustered out in 1866 as cuptain of
the Fourteenth United States Colored
Troops. He was appointed to a lieu
tenantcy in the regular service in 1867 and
assigned to the Thirty-seventh Infantry.
In 1867 he was transferred to the Fifth
Infantry and made a captain in 1885. He
was to have been retired on account of
age on tbe Ist of next month. His
daughter was known as the belle of the
post. Lieutenant O'Brien was sent by the
War Department to report on the war be
tween China and Japan and is an officer
of note. Mrs. O'Brien is the daughter of
Captain Kendall ol tho Sixth Cavalry, a
man of influence and standing. Lieu
tenant Bamford is a young and popular
officer.
It appeared from tbe court-martial
hearings that soou after tho O'Briens were
attached to the post, at the ciose of the
Japanese war, Mrs. O'Brien and Lieuten
ant Bamford began a vigorous flirtation.
Mr?. O'Brien rode the bicycie and her
husband did not. lieutenant Bamford
did. After some months all the woulen
who had ridden in company with the two
dropped out.
Bamford and Mrs. O'Brien continued
their rides together, and often made them
very long ones. It was then that the gos
sip began. On February 11 Mrs. O'Brien
gave a post dinner, and several declined
to attend. The attentions of Bamford to
her then and his frequent dances with her
at a ball two days later occasioned, re
newed gossip.
Then came the climax. Mrs. O'Brien
was going to the inauguration, and a
ycung railroad official of Atlanta named
Bennett volunteered to co with her. Cap
tain Romeyn entered the railway station
as they were starting and denounced Mrs.
O'Brien to Bennett in such terms that the
railroad man declined to accompany her.
Lieutenant O"Brien demanded an apology.
Captain Romeyn refused to make one.
Then Lieutenant O'Brien denounced
Romeyn at dress paraJe in the presence
of the officers of the command, and
Romeyn knocked him down on the spot.
The court-martial developed many sen
sations. The relations between Lieuten
ant O'Brien and bis wife were subject to
many innuendoes, and several open
charges, which were bitterly resented by
O'Brien.
Leutenant O'Brien declared that he
saw nothing improper in Lieutenant Barn
ford's attentions to his wife, or in any
ui her man's attentions to her. He en
couraged Bamford in riding the bicycle
with her; in fact, suggested their getting
a tandem.
Captain Romeyn openly insulted
O'Brien twice during this testimony about
iiis wife and Uamford, and was twice
obliged Dy the court to apologize. And
so, after several hearings marked by sen
sational testimony and violent ebullitions
of anger, the case was formally closed ten
days ag >. The result was announced yes
terday.

ROSENBERG'S " CONFESSION " IS

Final Struggle to Prevent the Ex

derer of Blanche Lamont.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 14.â 0n
each of two consecutive days Governor
Budd nas had to sit virtually as jury and
Judge and weigh life and death in the
scales of justice for two men condemned
to the gallows. On Thursday he listened
to the plea for clemency on behalf of S. D-
Worden, and to-day for more that three
hours he sat in his office and with consid
erable show of interest and consideration
gav>* hearing while Eugene N. Dauprey in
eloquent argument prayed for leniency
and whnt he claimed to be justice on be
half of William Henry Theodore Durrant,
convicted of the murder -of Blanche La
inont, and condemned to be hanged until
he i-> dead on the 11th of next month.
When the attorney announced that he
had exhausted his argumentative ammu
nition, for he brought absolutely no new
facts to the attention of the executive, tne
latter stated that be would look over all
the printed and written matter submitted
to him, give it very careful consideration
and announce his decision some day dur
ing tbe coming week.
If the Governor complies literally with
his declared intention he will be kept busy
reading continuously for a week at least.
Transcripts of testimony, voluminous
briefs, petitions and letters by the score
were submitted to him, accompanied with
apologies and condolences on the i art of
Deuprey.
Two point's of more than ordinary in
terest were developed in the course of the
hearing. Deuprey in a most po.nted man
ner directed the finger of suspicion at
Rev. J. George Gibson, who is so strenu
ously endeavoring to resign his pastorate
over Emmanuel Baptist Church, and by
a curt reference to the shipping records of
the San Francisco papers the Governor
showed the uiter absurdity and untruth
fulness of the "fake" confession of the al
leged real murderer of B.anch Lamont
that was pub:ished in the Examiner.
Blanch Limoni disappeared on April 3,
1895, and the ship Hospidar. on which
was John Rosenberg, who confessed to the
girl* murder, arrived on November 5,
1895,.ab0ut seven months after the com
mission of the crime.
Deuprey was accompanied by A. A.
Tuob, an attorney, who is working in
Durrant's interest independently of the
condemned man's duly anpuinted attor
neys. After Deuprey had finished Tubb
asked leave to rile a statement in the case
with the Governor and was granted per
mission to do so. He intimated it was to
he a revelation by a woman, who would
first have to apply to Home for permis
sion to divulge her information. Ho said
it might be a week or more beiore the
statement would be ready.
Though the time set for the hearing
was 10 A- M. it was twenty minutes of 11
o'clock before the Governor was ready.
There were about a dozen spectators pres
ent.
Deuprey opened by calling the Gover
nor's attention to the fact that notice bad
been served of the bearing on the District
Attorney of San Francisco. No one was
present, however, to represent Mr. Barnes.
He read the petition which had been in
the hands of the Governor several days,
and proceeded to criticize Judge Murphy'd
attitude while the trial was in progress.
He spoke of him as having been accus
tomed to act as prosecutor, and declared
it was difficult for tiiÂ« Judge to rid him
self of the prosecuting habit. "His man
ner of expressing his feelings â a lowering
of the eyebrow, a movement of the lips, or
a shrug of the shoulders," lie said, ''ex
pressed more to the jury than words could
do."
Deuprey at this point read a letter o
May 13 addressed to him by General
Dickinson, in which the latter excusad
himself from being at the hearing before
ihe Governor on the gror.nd ihat he was
engaged in the Craven-Fair casP. In this
he says he expects to nle a brief in the
ma:ier. He then continue!-.
"I am satisfied from expressions in the
public print, from letters received and
conversations had that public opmioQ is
changing U the Durrant case; perhaps
not to the extent of believing him en
tirely innocent, but certainly to the effect,
and pronouncedly so, tl a' the eviJence
upon which lie was convicte.i was ex
tremely slight and uncertain, and above
all things that he did not hhve a iair triai.
The American love of fair play, even to
one accused of a heinous crime, was so
shocked in this case that the penpie all
over the State as the day set for ihe exe
cution approaches are pausing and con
sidering ttie above propositions."
lurtuer along, referring to the trial, he
says:
"The public atmosphere waÂ«Â« snch that
for a juror on that panel 10 have hung the
jury, or for any considerable number of
them to have refused to find a verdict of
guiiiy would have resulted probabiy in
their being mobbed. I believe it to have
been physically impossible for Durrant to
have committed the crime of which he ia2
accused and was convicted, and am per
fectly sure that were he tried for the Wil
liams offense he would b<i acquitted from
the*vdence which is in our pos-e?sion
and which is also, most of it, Known to
ihe police. The method of identification
used by the police was the most brutal in
history."
In conclusion Dickinson wrole: ' lou
will notice that Brotner Gibson is Very
anxious to get away, and I commend your
attention to an article In The Call this
morning. Why, of course. 1 do not
know."
Commenting on this letter Deuprey
said :
"I want to call your Honor's attention
to the faci that we demanded to go to
trial on th 9 Williams case, but the D.s
tri<u Attorney, havinc the right to select,
selected tlie L;imont rase, and we were
ooliced to submit. We claim that if the
"Williams case is tried the guilty party
will be found, and all the elements of this
prosecution will be discovered and re
vealed."
Deuprey characterized the evidence in
tliecaseas beiiii? absolutely in-ufficient,
as the prosecution depended largely on
the matter of identification. In detail he
analyzed the testimony of the three
Fcho.'l^irisâ Mrs. Vogel, Mrs. Crossett
and Mrs. Leakeâ and denounced it as be
ing manufactured, without dishonest in
tent, perhaps, but he declared that ie was
largely evolved Irom a fertile imagination
or a weak brain. Pawnbroker Opren
heim's testimony he claimed to have been
given in fear of the detectives, and then
Irom the testimony of C. P. Lenaftan he
sought to convice the Governor that it
was Lenahan and not Durrant who had
offered to sell or pawn a ring in Auril,
] 885.
On the subject of identification he ar
gued that every person had at some time
or other been mistaken for another, and
appealed to the Governor to consider his
own experience in confirmation of this
assertion. Hedweiton the slight know!
--rd-e these witnesses had of the person of
Durrant, to s-how how easy it was for them
to have been mistaken in their identifica
tion oi him. He introduced affidavits
made by A. C. Lul-.rs and Henry Shaefer,
who claimed to have knowleiceof the real
murderer of Blanche Lamont, and who
they claim is another than Durrant.
D.'ii] rev explained that he placed no
weight on these statements, but simply
.introduced them to show how readiiy
peop'e become imbued with false ideas
and conceptions of things after they have
read or learned of them through the news
papers.
According to the testimony of the fel
low-students of Durrant, he stid, thecon
v.ct^d man was i>.t college at the very time
these witnesses claimed to have seen him
in company with Blanche Lamont on the
wav to the church.
He declar.d further that the conviction
was unjust and not according to law, in
that the prosecution failed to show any
motive for the crime and failed to prove
when and where tho crime was committed.
After calling the Governor's attention to
tbe newspaper fac-simil>Js of tne writing
on the newspaper which was wrapped
around the parcel of Blanche Lamont's
belonjrinns that were sent to her aunt and
comparing that writing wilh some of
Pastor Gibson's, Deuprey signiuantly
remarked:
"There are other people wno might be
charged with this crime. I was very se
verely criticized at tbe time for making
this plain during the trial, but I have not
changed my ideas about it."
Files of ti'.e newspai era containine the
accounts of tbe proceedings in the Dnr
rant case were submitted, and some of the
head lines in them were read to demon
strate that the newspapers were largely
responsible for creatine a hostile senti
ment toward Durrant. Deuprey also claim
ed the jurors were not in custody while
the trial was in progress, and that they
were free to go to their homes and places
of business and so come in contact with
people and hear prejudiced comments in
reference to the accused.
Letters were rea;i from John W. Pins
more, a minister of San Jose; George W.
Chamberlain, a lawyer of San Francisco,
and from Georse W. Campbell, president
of the California Christian Endeavor
Union of California, all of which appealed
for clemency for Durrant. A petition of
the same tenor, signed by about 506 resi
dents of San Francisco, among them Pro
fessor Cheney of the Cooper Medical Col
lege, was also submitted.
At this point Deuprey presented the
affidavit of John Rosenberg, now in
prison at San Quentin on a conviction of
horse-stealing. Rosenberg swears to being
the murderer of Blanche Lamont and re
cites in detail how he was lured to com
mit tbe crime. Among other things he
alleges that he arr.ved in San Francisco
on the ship Hospidar in March, 1895.
When Deuprey finished ihe reading of
this- document Governor lludd quietly
turned over a file of a San Francisco paper
ana showed by the shipping columns that
the Hospidar arrived here November 5 or
fi. Deuprey smiled and admitted that he
placed no weight on the affidavit. He
added that he introduced it simp'.y to
show the necessity of giving time for fully
investigating ilie various stories that im
plicated others in the crime, as an investi
gation might result in proving the inno
cence of his client. He said a further
reason for his placing no faith in this
story of Rosenberg was that it did not
aaree with his theory. In conclusion
DeUDr?y said:
"In my view, having been brought into
close contact with this man, I believe that
he is entitled to a pardon, but I ask that
at least your Excellency grant a reprieve,
if you believe you cannot go that far. I
believe we are certainly justified in asking
a respite, so thai a fair investigation may
be made. vVe are entitled in view of all
theshadowb of doubt that exist in this
case to this mucb."
"I will look carefully into the matter."
replied tne Governor, "and during the
latter part of next week I will inform you
of my dpcision."

REMARKABLE CASE
OF REV. T. H. HANNA
Becomes the Victim of a
Most Peculiar State
of Mind.
After Falling Upon His Head
He Forgets All Previous
Knowledge.
Now in the New Ufa He Again Falls
In Love With His Old
Sweetheart.
NEW HAVEN. Con.v., May 11-Tbe
most remarkable case of amnesia ever
known exists in Piantsville, a quiet vil
lage about twenty miles from this city.
The Rev. T. H. Hanna. pastor of the
P.antsville Baptist Church, is the victim.
On Apr.l 7 Mr. Hanna stopped i.is horse
to adjust a strap of the harness. As he
attempted to jump from his carriage
his feet caught in the robe and
he was thrown headlong to the ground
knocked unconscious. When taken home
his mind was pone and when conscious-
ness returned his memory was a blank.
He did not know bis parents; he did not
even know the meaning of the words
"father" and "mother." He could not
speak a word of any language and the
task of teaching him to talk, walk and
act was begun all over again.
The relations of his family were ex-
I'hiine i to him, and like a new-born babe
he was aga<n taught to read, write and
even eat. Every bit of the Bible that be
had learned had slipped from his mem
ory. Mr. Hatiua was a vigorous athlete,
but he forgot how to play baseball and
how to ride the bicycle. He was an adept
typewriter, but he has forgotten all about
the instrument and is now learning the
key* again.
Mr. Hanna was an accomplished musi
cian, but how to play an instrument was a
lost art to him and he has taken to prac
ticing auew. His second childhood has a
romantic side to it. He ha 9 shown for
several years a marked preference for a
young woman of the village, but when he
met her after his accident be did not
know her. He was again introduced to
her and the friendship between the two
has again been developing. This is de
clared by a couple of Yale professors, who
have been interesting themselves in the
case, to be indicative of the fact that there
was a natural foundation for the love
which readily asserted itself after the
mental lapse.
Tbeosopbists say: "This match, if such
it should prove to be, was made in
heaven.'* Mr. Han na was a lover of the
languages, especially Latin and Greek,
but bis entire vocabulary seems to have
slipped from his mind. His technical
education has gone. All his friends are
being introduced to him again. He learns
of their former association with him with
interest. The specialists regard tbe case
with much interest. There is no fracture,
and the prevailing opinion is that when
he struck on his head he pressed the cere
bral cellular tissues together. He has
never felt any p.-vin.

the l'aimenger Association.
CHICAGO, 111., May 14.â Satisfactory
progress is being made by the executive
committee of the Western Passenger
Association in inducing outside roads to
become members. J. C. Stubbs, vice
president of the Southern Pacific, was in
conference with the committee this after
noon regarding the membership of his
road. It. is expected that Stubbs will sign
for his road. It is also believed that the
Northern Pacific and Great Northern will
be induced to join without much delay.
They have stated their readiness to do so
the minute that the Canadian Pacific
does, but are not prepared to say that
they will join without it. Definite replies
are expectel from tfe* Minneapolis and
St. Louis, Wisconsin Central and Chi
cago and Great Western by next Tuesday.
Lomax, general passenger agent of the
Union Pacific, is expected here on Mon
i day, and it is thought that he will theu
I sien. All that has kept thÂ» Union Pa
cific out thus far has been lack of advice
from Judge Dillon, general counsel of the
road, as to the strict legality of the agree
ment. Judge Dillon has advised the
Missouri Pacific, tor which he is also
chief legal adviser, that it may sign. It
has already done so, and no doubt is
entertained that he will give the Union
Pacific similar adv.ee.

NE\y YORK, BT. V., May 14.â Frederick
de Liatour Booth-Tucker did not appear
when bis name was caileJ in the General
Session to-day in answer to an indictment
for keeping a disorderly house in ihe Sal
vation Army barracks. H.s counsel en
tered a plea of not guilty.
Booth-Tucker intends to make a stub
born light in the maittr. He slates that
his all-night prayer meetings are not
nearly so noisy as his enemies have pre
tended. He believes that the prosecution
is a mischievous one, and some of the Sal
vation Army people do not hesitate to say
that the Volunteers, instigated by Balling
ton Booth, are behimi the matter.
The Salvation Army leaders oay they
are sorry the trouble is in the courts, as
they thought that their lons fight under
severe persecutions had eniiiied them to
immunity from arr<Â»Â«t. They realize that
the example of t!ie New York authorities
will be followed aJI over the country.
For that reason able lawyers have been
retained, and strong effort will be made to
show that the ali-night prayer-meeiings
come under the protection of the consti
tution of the United States, which allows
men to worship in their <v,n fashion.

PAXTON, 111., May 14.â There was
considerable excitement in this town to
day over an execution which attracted a
great deal cf attention. For some time
past F. WilJiam Hoellman has been under
sentence of death for the murder of Airs.
Weibke Geddes. A good deal of pressure
was brought to bear on the Governor to
pardon him. All efforts to save him,
however, were in vain, as executive olh'
cers refused to iuterfere.
All the preparations were mnde last
uight for the execution, which look place
early this morning-. The rope was tested
and found to be in good condition. At 6
A. M. Hoellman was awakened ana given
a hearty breakfast. The death warrant
was read to him after he had eaten. He
was then taken to the scaffold.
It was believed by the officials that be
would break down at the last moment,
and they were ready to strap him to a
board in case he should collapse. Hoell
man, however, was firm and facea the
death preparations bravely. When asked
what he had to say he replied itiut be was
innocent. The drop fell at 7:15 and Hoell
man died very quickly.

large meeting to-night. This morning
Mann was notified by the police that he

Mann has been boast. ng greatly for

Parisians so that there would bs plenty
of trouble before long. He evea went so
far as to intimate that tbe days of 1789
mizht be repeated. The Dolics have been
watching him for some days past. They
did not want him to cause any trouble,
nor did they wish to arrest him until they
were absolutely forced to do so. Because
of their inaction Mann thought that they
would let the mutter drop and would al
low him to speak. He found out to-day,
however, thai he was mistaken.

DISASTROUS FIRE AT LEXINGTON.
Totcl Destruction of the Courthouse â The

LEXINGTON, Ky., May 14.â A disas
trous fire occurred in this city this morn
ing, causing a loss of fully $200,000. It
started in the courthouse in some un
known way, and was under considerable
headway before it was discovered. It was
entirely beyond control by the time the
fire department arrived on the scene.
By 10:30 the courthouse was a mas* of
ruins, and the fire had spread to the Sayre
Institute and other neighboring buildings.
The Savre Institute is a girls' school,
well known through the South and West.
When it caught fire there wa3 almost a
panic among its pupils, v.'ho rushed ex
citedly into the street. A!l of them suc
ceeded in getting out sately, but most of
them lo:<t considerable personal property
in the fire. At 1 o'clock the fire was under
control. Part of the institute was saved.
One of the most serious losses by iue
fire was the magnificent statue of "The
Triumph of Chastity," by Joel Hart, which
stood in the institute. It fell from its
niche and was broken into fragments.

BACK FROM SUNRISE CITY.
Schooner Stella Erland Brings News
From Utters in the Far
North.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 14.â The schoon
er Stella Eriand arrived from Cooks Inlet
this morning. She made the run from
Saldovia Bay to Seattle in thirteen days.
From the inlet she brings the news for the
winter, having been the only boat this
soring to pass through the ice blockade,
reaching Sunrise City and returning to
Seattle. At Six-mile everybody is well.
The whites have had plenty to eat.
The Erland brought no tidings of the
three wen who were reported missing just
after the arrival of the Ai bionâ George
Bottcher, C. A. Blackstone and J. W. Mo
linque. They undertook to cross the For
age to Prince Williams Sound, and they
probably never reached tidewater on tais
side.
On the way up the Erland passed
through a storm on March 23. it was, no
doubt, the hurricane which wrecked the
General Kiclin. The Erland was further
north, and probabiy encountered only the
weaker end of the storm; bat she had
enough of it to make things look dubious
for a winie. However, the Erland is a
lucky boat. She has encountered all sorts
of storms and has several times been sup
posed to be lost, but she always returns in
safety.
Ihe schooner Alexandria is reported
safe at Saldovia by the Erland. The
Alexandria belonged to the same line ss
the Siglin, but they parted company in
the storm. The Erland saw no wreckage
of any kind on the way back. The loss of
the Siglin was conceded when she left the
north.
SHOULD CARRY
EXTRA PILOTS
Steamboat Navigators
Liable to Be Shot
by Guards.
Desperate Measures Adopted
to Protect the Southern
Levees.
Damasre Done by the Floods in
Louisiana Net as Great as
at First Reported.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 14.â Simon
Leblanc, Levee Commissioner of Iber
ville Parisn, in a notice published in the
papers, warns the steamers Ouachita,
Leathers, Speed and others that bo has
instructed day and night levee guards to
open lire on any steamboats coming too
near the levee or traveling too fast.
Boats are advised to provide extra pilots
so as to have them ready to lake the places
of regular pilots in case the latter are shot
by levee guards. The pilots reply that in
case one of their number is siiot it will
assure a crevasse, as the boat will become
unmanageable, clash against the bank and
destroy tho levee beyond all question.
The Tensas and Black rivers and the
backwater of the Ten?as basin swamp
have all come to a standstill, indicating
that Biggs crevasse has reached a maxi
mum and done all the harm it can. From
this time on there will ba a declind not
only of the river itself, but in the over
flowed section.
It is now possible to estimate the dam
ace In Louisiana caused by the overflow
and Jt is much less than was first esti
mated. The actual area of cultivated
lands overflowed was: Madison, 80 per
ceni ; Tensas, 18 per cent; Concordia, 20
per cent; Catahoula, 15 per cent. Al
though Biggs crevasse is the largest ever
known in Louisiana, the pecuniary dam
age is far behind many previous years.
The actual amount of cotton destroyed by
the overflow will not exceed 28.000 bales,
and it is probable some oi the land over
flowed can yet be replanted in cotton.
The greatest loss was inflicted in the Tensas
district. Nearly the entire working popula
tion of the Tensas district has been taken
from farm labor to work on the levee.-. The
consequence is a reduction in the acreage
planted in all crops. Crops meanwhile
are later than usual Because of the over
flow, not in so good a condition as usual
and very much neglected.
CaDtain Derby, United States engineer,
in command of the district from VicSs
burg to the gulf, says: "In our district
the levee boards have raised about 225
miles of levees in this fight. This has
been an expensive fight, costing $300,000."
The New Orleans Levee Board has de
cided to borrow another $100,000 in antici
pation of the revenue of 18D3. When the
Hood began the board had $50,000. This
has been spent. Four weeks ago it bor
rowed $100,000 on this year's revenue.
Nearly all this will be exhausted to-mor
row and the board wants 10 borrow $100,
--000 more, thus putting it in debt for two
years to come.

Mallory is a pronounced silver man.
He was born in Pensacola November 2,
1848, and when only 16 years of age en
tered the Confederate army. A few
months later, early in 1865, he was made
a midshipman in the Confederate navy.
At the end of the war he entered the
Georgetown Coiiege, District of Columbia,
was graduated in 1869, taught in the col
lege until 1871 and a ye:ir la;er was ad
mitted to the bar in Louisiana. In 1874
he removed to Peiisacola, where he has
ever since practiced law. He served three
terms in the F orida Legislature and rep
resented his State in the Ffty-second
Congress. He is a son of Stephen Russell
Mallory, Secretary of the Navy of the
Confederate State*.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 14.â The
election of Stephen Mallory as Senator
irom Florida to succeed Call surprised the
Senators. Mallory served in the House
during the Fifty-third Congress, and his
failure to secure renomination was under
s'ood to be due to his opposition to the
free coinage of silver. If he has not
; changed bis views he will make the fourth
gold Democrat in the Senate â Gray, Lind
say and Caffery being the other tlirep.
Mallory 's election leaves but one vacancy
in the Senate â Oregon. Corbett claims
thf s -at by virtue of his aipointment by
the Governor, the Legislature having
failed to organize.
Tins afternoon Burrows, Chandler and
Hoar of the Committee on Elections and
Privileges had a conference of an hour re
garding this case. It wae> decided that
, Burrows, acting chairman of the commit
tee, should call a meeting of the commit
tee to consider the Coibett case. It is not
expected that the result will be different
from that reached In other cases ot" like
character, which was that the Governor's
appointee cannot ha seated. An informal
canvass of the Senate hits developed the
fact that the vote against seating Corbett
is likely to be larger than in thn Montana,
Washington and Wyoming cases.

WINCHESTER, Ky.. May 14.â A thirty
days' resnite was granted to Dillard
Rainey, the young man who was to hang
for the murder of Aaron Adams. It is
said that Rainey has made quite a favor
able impresiion on some religions people
who were visitinc hiru. They Jiked nim
so much that they promised to make a
minister of him if he shonld be pardoned.
There is small hope, however, taat Rainey
will be pardoned.
Despite his recent protestations of re
ligion, the prison officials look on him as
a thorouenly hardened and depraved
criminal, and they have been watching
him very closely to see that he did not
escape. They assert that. Rainey is a two
faced fellow, who assumes religion with
the people he wishes to deceive, while he
is entirely different with secular people.

ing twenty-four families of pacificosfrom
the province of Santa Clara. The families
were found near shore starving and were
s;nt to outposts at Cienfuegos with other
iamine-stricken non-combatants by orders
( if Weyler.
At Pozo Lnnar, Santa Clara province, a
Spanish battalion found seventy-four
aruilies starving in huts. Instead of giv
ing them an> relief the Spaniards treated
i hem brutally. Women, old men and
children were brought to a place near the
Spanish fort and were obliged to stay
there within sight of the guard without
shelter or focd.
At Gune?, Havana province, several
Spanish physicians were detailed to re
port on sanitary measures necessary to
chock smallpox. They were so much
impressed by the situation that even at
tne risk of being persecuted they presen ted
a few days ago to the sanitary department
of the town a report denouncing the care
lessness of the Spanish authorities. In
the suburbs they found persons stricken
witu smallpox without any medical as
sistance and crowded into smnll huts.
The reservoir which provides drinking
v:ater for the town is terribly polluted.
More than a foot oi organic matter coats
the bottom. After the report was pre
sented the sanitary department ordered a
new hospital erected immediately. The
sick were transferred to the new building
and abandoned there, and after tu'.rly-six
hours without assistance the majority
dieil from hunger.
At Â£1 Limonar, near Matanzas, Spanish

Forty out of 100 auerril las were killed. The

TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
President McKinley Will Send a
Vigorous Message to Con
gress.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, May 14.â The
President wiii adhere to his original pur
rose and send to Congress early next
week a message recommending an appro
priation for food, medicine and other as
sistance to starvine American citizens in
Cuba. At the Cabinet meeting this morn
ing, which convened at an early hour in
anticipation of the departure of the Presi
dent and Cabinet for Philadelphia, the
Cuban situation was considered in ail its
phases. The meeting adjourned before a
conclusion was reached, but the confer
ence continued on the way to Philadel
phia, and information since has been re
ceived here that in all probability the mes
sage will Oe written Monday.
Secretaries Sherman and Long did not
accompany the Presidential party to
Philadelphia. They will to-morrow com
plete the compilation of reports wnich
the President will Â«end to Congress as the
basis of iiis recommendation for relief.
Secretary Long and Judge Day, who is
the active head of the State Department,
conierred together this afternoon, and
bjgan tne work of making extracts from
reports already received from agents of
the Government in Cuba, which will be
laid before the President immediately
uron his return. Loner and Day have
telegraphed to Consul-General Lee and
others for reports upon the immediate
situation, and when the President begins
the pieparatiou of his message Monday he
will find a concise statement of facts be
fore him.
At the Cabinet meeting the Cuban
question arose upon inquiries from sev
eral Secretaries as to what basis existed for
the ularminc newspaper reports of tne
past few days. The President replied
frankly that while nothing like a crisis
was expected l.c had decided to take a
prompt step in the direction of rendering
assistance to suffering Americans in Cuba.
The President sÂ»id ibis determination did
not indicate the adoption of a new Cuban
policy, but was simply an expression of
his deep conviction after readme fully all
the reports.
The President explained further that his
iniention to send a special Cuban message
Was merely in line with his general policy
Of protection to Ameiican citizens every
where under all circumstances. He stated
frankly he had no idea of performing any
executive war in Cuba at present, but
would await the report of Calhoun, whom
he nas sent to Cuba to ascertain and
report all the facts of the situation. In a
word McKinley plainly stated to his
Cabinet advisers that Foraker's explana
tion in tne Senate Tuesday regarding the
policy of the administration was literally
trie and accurate.
Spanish Minister De Lome called on
Judce Day and said the Spanish officials
would gladly assume the task of distribut
ing the proposed relief, but the Assistant
Secretary said the Government would be
satisfied to put this work in the hauds of
Consul-General Lee.
READY TO GO TO SEA.
Rush Orders That May Mean the
New York Is to Be Hurried
to Key West.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 15.-The Her
ald's special says: Orders have been sen:
to Rear Admiral Montgomery Sicard to
have t&a flacship New York made ready
to go to sea from i>ew York at a moment's
warning. She is to nil up with coal to
the full capacity.
The haste with which the vessel is to
prepare may be judged from the fact that
although she needs only about 170 tons to
till her bunkers this amount of fuel will
be hurried on board to-day and to-mor
row. Concerning the flagship's destina
tion nothing could be learned at the Navy
Department. Secretary Long said to
night there was no significance in the
orders.
It has been suggested that Consul-Gen
eral Lee has renewed his request that a
naval force be kept within a short distance
of Havana for the protection ot American
citizens ag.iinst mob violence. There is
no corroboration of this theory, biU the
belief amonc navy officers is strong that
the New York is to be held in complete
readiness to go to Key West at a moment's
warning.

MADRID, Spain, May 14.â 1n the Cortes

LOS AaVGELES, Cal., May 14.â Some

chemical analysis of food samples submit

published, he denounced as adulterations
certain samples of the jelly made for Bar
nard & Dinsmore of tt.ia city by Goldberg,
Bovren ifc Co.
Now Bernard & Dlnsmore do not like
that kind of notoriety, and they not only
resent it, but will attempt to disprove the
statement. The firm has sent to the San

saying that the Chamber oi Commerce of
Los Angeles is investigating the matter,
and that it is believed t at a substitution
was made to the detriment of the local
firm's reputation. The board in San
Francisco has ordered four samples of the
jellies sent to it, which will be analyzed
by other chemists.

TRAIN ROBBERS
USE DYNAMITE
They Hold Up a Southern
Pacific Train in
Texas.
By Blowing Open Safes the
Bandits Secure Several
Thousand Dollars.
Passensrers Not Molested, but They
Are Duly Warned by a Volley
of Shots.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 14.â The
Southern Pacific train, westbound, was
held up and robbed this morning at Lo
zier, a Mag station, 265 miles west of hers.
There were three men in the party, and
while one stood guard over the engineer
and fireman the other two attacked the
express-car with dynamite.
The car was shattered to pieces, the top
and side being blown away. Messenger
W. H. Joyce narrowly escaped. Two rob
bers then entered the wrecked car. The
one guarding the engineer and fireman
brought his charges back to the car and
forced them to help clear away the wreck
age so dynamite could be placed on the
through and local safes. Both safes were
then shattered. The robbers took every
thing of value and, it is believed, secured
several thousand dollars.
The robbers held the train for nearly
an hour and a half and then mounted
horses and rode off, tiring a volley of
shots at the train as a warning that pur
suit would be dangerous.
The passengers were unmolested. The
througn safe was opened last at Houston,
and the local manager of the Wells-Fargo
Express Company claims to have no
knowledge of the amount it contained.
The Federal authorities of this district
have had positive knowledge for three
months past that the robbery of a South
ern Paciiic train was being planned. The
robbers were from New Mexico. Their
names are known to United States Mar
shal Ware. It is expected their capture
will be easily effected.
KINGS BURG FATHER'S DISGRACE.
Gits Intox'cated While Going to Bury
Mis Dead Babe and Neglects
H s M ss io r.
FRESNO, Cal., May 14.â Early this
morning the police fonnd a horse and
cart hitched on the street, and as the ani
mal had been standing there all night
without food or water an officer took the
rig to a livery stable. It wes apparent
that the conveyance was from the coun
try, and seeing a box in the bottom of the
cart the stablemen came to the conclusion
that it contained a crate of strawberries.
Their mouths began to water for the
luscious berries, and finally Uey yielded
to the temptation and broke open the
box.
To their horror they found tbat it con
tained a deaJ baby wrapped among some
sheets. The matter was reported to Coro
ner Long, and after a search of several
hours the owner of the vehicle was found.
Uis name is John Ryan. A policeman
tound him Â«leepine oil a spree in a door
wÂ»v of the Fiske building.
"When awakened he was considerably
sobered and he immediately inquired for
ihe whereabout* ol his horse and cart.
When told where they were he asked
about the box, which he said contained his
deait babe. Mr. Ryan further explained
that his home was at Kingsburs and
that lie started out yesterday to bring the
dead child to this city for burial. He be
gan drinking at saloons on the way, and
when he arrived in Fresno last night he
tied up the horse and went on a spree, he
felt his disgraceful conduct very keenly.
It was ascertained that the death of the
child was from natural causes and that
there was no need for an inquest. Mr.
Ryan was permitted to bury the little one
at the cemetery this afternoon.

GHOSTS HAUNT MARIN'S MORGUE.
Deputy Coroner Eoen Startled by Un
ccnny Noises Issuing From
Coffins.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May 14â Deputy
Coroner William Eden is willing to take
his oath that there are "spooks" in the
Marin County Morgue. The spook craze
has apparently struck San Rafael with
as much force as has the prize-fighting
fever, for the story about the morgue be-
me infea;ed with uncanny creatures fol
lows closely upon the tales told by pris
oners confined In the "haunted" cham
ber in the Marin County Jail.
Deputy Coroner William Eden is a son
of Coroner Eden and well known in San
Raiael, where he has lived all his life.
"Last Tuesday night," said be, "I was
sitting in the front office of the morgue
at about 11 o'clock talking with a friend.
Suddenly I heard a noise like an animal
scratching the ground. This was followed
by the noise of the moving of some
object over the floor. The sounds came
from u.e room just in back of the parlor,
where we were iittinsj.
" Thinking that there might be some
person in the room I went back, and
opening the door, stepped up to the gas
jet and pulled the cord which lights the
gas. In the room are a number of cases
containing coffins. As I turned up the
light 1 saw the cases move distinctly.
There was a sudden flash, v noise and that
was all.
" I was frightened for l could not make
out what could possibly cause the dis
turbances. My courage returned and I
set about to investiiiate. I looked over
the entire establishment but could dis
cover nothing amiss. 1 returned to my
companion and told him of what 1 had
seen ana heard and he left immediately
and has not since been back. The room
was formerly used as the old morgue
until we fixed up another in the rear and
it may have been the ghosts of some of
the departed that returned.
"I might assign tne strange experience
to some otner cause, but not a long time
ago the Coroner, my father, was putting
on his coat in the rear office when sud

FINIGAN IS NOW
AN INSOLVENT
His Petition Filed in
Judge Angrelotti's
Court.
The Ex-Millionaire Says His
Debts Are Greater Than
His Assets.
Wants to Purge Himself of Con
tempt and Get Out of
Marln's Jail.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May li.âAccord
ing to his own admission and by virtue of
documents filed here to-night, Colonel
Peter A. Finigan is an insolvent and not
the millionaire that his friends and also
his enemies have believed him to be.
Attorney J. P. Sweeny of Lange's col
lec'ion agency came over from San Fran
cisco this evening, bringing with him the
turfman's petition, and presented the
papers to Judge Aneelotti. The colonel
swears that his million or millions have
dwindled to $12,000 or less, and that the
interests represented by this amount are
mortgaged until they will produce next
to nothing. His liabilities he fixes at a
much greater figure than his assets, and
if his statement is accepted by Judge An
gelotti he will not bo "on the board"
when the final settlements are made.
Mr. Finigan admits that he owes to A.
B. Spreckels $5000 on a note representing
that much borrowed money; that C. C.
Bemis, the real estate man, is his creditor
to the extent of $7000 on a mortgage ; that
P. T. McDermott, the stockman, is en
titled to claim $2060 on a note; that he
owes Mrs. Finigan $850 for alimony, and
that he owei William Lange Jr. $50 for
money borrowed.
As to assets the colonel is more modest.
His Calaveras mining property is claimed
to be worth but $5000 and his one-sixth in
terest in the Oakland track $7000. Both
of these propertie* are mortgaged and are
not readily salable. More, beyona a
watch, ring and a few suits of clothes, the
colonel says he has not.
His attorney deposes likewise and
asserts that Finigan's former wealth has
tied through unprofitable money ventures,
fat bets on horseraces And the trouble thai
his wile's suit for divorce has brought
upon him.
The colonel's reason for exhibiting the
paucity of his worldly belonaings is that
he wants to get out of durance in the
Marin County jail, where he has been in
carcerated for six weeks. Judge Ange
lotti ordered him into custody because he
neglected, either through inability or un
willingness, to pay the alimony and coun
sel fees awarded to his wife. In view of
the disclosures of the petition in insol
vency the story of the colonel's financial
woes takes on a humorous turn. His v;ife
had him incarcerated because she thought
he had plenty ot funds with which to *ei
tle her alimony, and he remained in jail
because he had no money with which to
pay. Now that he has concluded to tell
of his condition it is probable that he will
be released and nis wife paid her claims
out of the sale of bis estate.

SCENE OF YESTERDAY'S BIG FIRE.
The large building at 541 Market street, occupied by S. N. Wood & Co. (Columbian
Woolen Mills) as their main stores, was visited by a serious fire early yesterday morning. The
extensive stock of cloth and clothing was not reached by the flames, but was damaged to some
extent by smoke and water. Although several hundred people employed by this firm are
thrown out of employment by the fire, it will be only for a few days.
This unforeseen occurrence of course puts an end to the great tariff sale of clothing which
has been going on for some weeks. Pending the adjustment of losses by the insurance com-
panies no business can be done on the premises, and meantime orders can be left at the branch
store, corner Powell and Eddy streets.
of natural death to-day. The doctor's
analysis showed that tbe gases had pro
duced poison. A telegram sent by Coro

Mrs. Finnie's husband, the reply received
from that place stating that Finnic had
left there the day before. The body is at
the morgue.

PALO ALTO, Cal., May 14.â The
chapel was crowded to overflowing this
evening, the occasion being the celebra
tion of the twenty-ninth anniversary of
the birth of Leland Stanford Jr. Mrs. Stan
ford attended the exercises given in mem

The programme was almost entirely
musical, the first number being the "Pil
gnms" chorus from "TiÂ»nnhauser." This
was rendered by the Glee Club, whose
"Stanford College Song" was also given
with dash and express-ion. The violin
quartet, in which Brunton, Wilson, bco
vilie and Bittlewells participated, was
loudly applauded and they responded to
the chorus.
Professor Hudson of the English depart
ment read an essay prepared and delivered
in 1893 on a former memorial day. The
subject, although it had not been revised,
wan appropriate and extremely interest
ing.
The vocal solo of Miss May Ferrel,
"Little Boy Blue," and the piano and
flute duet by Dr. Goebel and Dr. Stallard
of Menlo Park were greatly enjoyed by the
audience. The programme concluded
with a vocal solo, "A Hindoo Chant, " by
Mrs. M. bmith. The difficult passage*
were given with great delicacy of expres

MISSING DEED FOUND AFTER
YFARS CF SEAHCH.
Heirs of Jonathan Carver to B.'ing
Suit to Recover Ht3 Prop
erty.
ST. HELENA. Cat.., May 14.â A deed
recently discovered in the records of Chil
licothe County. Ohio, will probably be
the foundation fora big lawsuit ?oon to
be instituted for the possession of 7,000.000
acres of valuable land, on part of which
the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul now
stand.
Long before the Revolution of 177G Jon
athan Carver, an Englishman, settled
among the Nawiiawissie Indian* and for
valuable services rendered io them in
times of war he was given a grant of land.
George HI afterward caused the Indians
to be driven from their lands, but permit
ted Jonathan Carver to keep his lands by
virtue of a royal patent. Shortly after
tbis Carver identified himself with the
American revolutionists, and they, reeog*
nizing his value to them, also gave him a
p itent to the land.
This land was afterward deeded by Car
ver to Bishop Samuel Peters of New York,
but by some oversight the deed was nevet
feigned by Carver and no record was made
of it. Toe deed of gift made by the Naw
dawissie Indians was lost and could not
be found, and for more thau one hundred
years the Carver heirs have searched lor
it in vain.
Recently the much coveted deed was
discovered in the old records of Chilli
cothe County, Ohio. The antiquity of the
document was noted in a newspaper and
reached the eyes of the present claimants.
C. B. Holloway of Holland, Ohio, and
O. W. Gunn of Miumee, have visited
Chillecotiie and procured a certified copy
of the deÂ«ds which it is claimed will
establish the title of the Carver heirs to a
vast tract of 7,000.000 acres of land in the
Northwest, covering an area of 1230 miles,
and on which is located St. Paul and Min
neapolis and several smaller cities. A
number of railroads also traverse this
territory.
Mr. Holloway's wife is the grand
daughter of Jonathan Carver and Mr.
Gunn is a great-grandson.
The St. llelena claimants are well
known here. They have certainly been
discreet, as they had known of the exist
ence of the important deed for many
years, but kept their counsel.
D. B. Carver, who was president of the
Carver National Bankiu St. Helena until
his death, and enjoyed a high social and
commercial rating during his life, had for
many years employe'! peopie in searching
for the documents which could be used in
pressing his c'aim to the land. D. B.
Carver's widow, Mr?. F. & Robinson, now
is the East, holds tlie<e documents, and
with the recently d soovered deed has
almost a certainty wuh which to back xip
her suit. As soon as si>e return from tbe
East she will begin the prosecution of the
suit for the land, and many lawyers hÃve
declared that she can establish h-r claim.
The local heirs are: Mrs. F. E. Robin
sou, widow of the !a:e D. IS. Carver; Mrs.
Sarah Carver; Mrs. W. A. Bingbam, wife
oi tne present Mayor of St. Helena, and
Mrs. D. B. Carver Jr. The claimants are
all mople of considerable wer.hh and have
'he capital to carry on I tM liiic-uion.
END OF A MARYSViLLE ROMANCE.
Mrs. Robert Sherwood, Formerly Kiss
Hops El Us, Granted a Divorce
Frcm Her Husband.
__ MAHYSVILLE, Cal., May 14. -Judge
E. A. Davis lias granted a decrae of di
vorce in the suit o: Mr.*. Robert Sherwood
ag;ainÂ«t Robert Sherwood, the son of
Hobart Sherwood, the late San Francisco
mining capitalist, and awarded the cus
tody of the minor child to the mother.
As Hope Ellis, the handsome daughter
of William T. Ellis, a prominent merchant
here, the plaintiff in this suit was a belle
of MarysviJle and hrd many suitors.
Among (hem wa3 Robert Sherwood,
v.ho all agreed had a brizht future be
fore him, and he was the favored one as
subsequent events proved. It was known
that Miss Kilis and the son of the San
Francisco mining man were very fond of
each other's company, but. few imagined
that their marriage would come in the
romantic manner it did. Miss Ellis in
vited a coterie ol friends to a racial gather
ing at her home one evening, and while
the festivities were at their height an
nounced that there would be a wedding
ceremony to brine the affair to a happy
climax. Rev. Dr. Hay of Marysville was
announced, the programme that had evi
dently been arranged by the young couple
beforehand was earned out, and they
were pronounce! man and wife.
The news of the wedding came as a great
surprise to Sherwood's friends in this City
and many of Mrs. Sherwood's intimates
did not know of it nntil the next day.
Within a few years came stories of dis
cord in the Sherwood family. The hus
band neglected his wife, and her father
finally ordered him to leave her for good.
She was lying dangerously i.i at home at
the time and the father allowed Sherwood
to bid her good-by in bis presence. Mrs.
Sherwood fearing publicity did not im
mediately apply for a divorce, but waited
until a few weeks ago, and then asked for
a legal separation on the ground of deser
tion. She will remain at the home of her
father here.

POMONA'S NOVEL LIQUOR LAW.
P.oh.bitionista Tfircugheut forma In
iensted in the Reform Ordi
nance.
, POMONA, Cal., May 14.â "1t is wonder
ful," said Mayor C. P. Patterson of Po
mona to-day, "the attention given up and
down the Pacific Coast to ; the new ordi
nance our City Council lias passed
licensing two saloons in Pomona. Letters
and telegrams from almost every town on
the coast have already come, asking for
the text of the new saloon ordinance, and
several people could keep busy for a
week answering letter* ot inquiry about
this or that legal point in the ordinance.
Most of the people say they have read
about the new law in The Call. Clergy
men wish to know more about the legal
provisions that remove all argument from
the saloons and whether the saloons run
so watchfully anil openly will diminish
drinking of intoxicant*. A score of men
j and women In San Francisco say they
have studied the saloon and license ques
tion for a generation.-and they believe
our Pomona law is the neatest to the con
trol of the liquor tariff they have ever
known. Saloon-keepers have telegraphed
for official copies 01 the law to keep as
curiosities of how blue-stocKings will
legislate when they get into power." .
There can be no doubt that this unique
law will be faithfully executed. Already ;
fifteen men wish to give $5000 bonds and
pay the $1000 license each lor the privi
lege ot running one of the two saloons in I
Pomona. They will be compelled under
pain of forfeiting their bonds to keep all
the municipal provisions for managing
their places. Licensee will be issued next
week, and thousands ot people interested
in reform and temperance movements will
watch the progress of Pomona's reform
system.
William A. Bell. City Attorney of Po.
mona and author of this unusual law.
said to The Call correspondent to-day
that the law was the result of a study of
ordinances on this line, besides all the de
cisions of the Supreme Court on similar
questions.
"There never was such a law before,"
said Sir. Bell, "but the Supreme Court of
California has decided questions along
this line of police regulations in accord
ance with Pomona's new ordinance."

SHORTHAND IN THE SENATE.
Mr. Blason of Illinois the Latest loliti-
cat Expert to Be Klecled.
The election of "Billy" Mason will add
another competent shorthand reporter to
the membership of tue United States Sen
ate. Several years ago he was considered
one of the best in the country. Judge
Withrow of the Rock island Railroad
used to say that a first-class stenographer
was spoiled when Mason went into poli
tics.
It is not generally known that Senator
Chandler 01 New Hampshire is also a pro
ficient stenographer, like Representative
liitt of Illinois. Both of them have been
professionals, and both still use the short
hand system In making notas during de
bates, committee meetings, etc. Al
though he has not had any active prac
tice for twenty-live or tuirty years Mr.
Cuandier is able to make and transcribe
his notes as rapidly as when he. was a
young man in daily practice as a reporter
for the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.
One day in a committee meeting of Sen
ators there was a lively dispute between
Mr. Chandler and a Democratic colleague.
As it grew beatea, Mr. Chandler, who is
always an exasperating antagonist in a
controversy, accused his opponent of
contradicting himself, which toe latter
stoutly denied.
'"I will teli you exactly what you said,"
retorted Mr. Chandler. '"I thought you
were speaking recklessly and would dis
avow it sooner or later, so i took your
words down in shorthand."
Then he began to read from a page cov
ered with pothooks, and the other mem
bers of the commiitee tesliiied to the ac
curacy of his report.
Several years ago in New Hampshire an
important legal case arose which rested
upon the accuracy of the translation of
the notes of the Miorthand reporter who
had been employed by an attorney in the
case, and Senator Chandler was called
upon as an expert. A. great deal de
pended upon wtiether a certain sign in
the notes should be translated "at" or
"of." Mr. Chandler took an envelope out
of his pocket and on the back of
it made two marks with a lead pencil.
"Now," he said to the attorney, "if you
can tell mo which of thege characters wns
used in the copy I will tell you without
looking at it which word it was intended
for. The characters used for 'at' and 'of
are generally similar, but any sten
ographer can distinguish them at a
glance." â Chicago Record.
BOEING TOE NATURAL STEAM,
It la Said That It Can Be Found Ivo
Miles Down.
â  The deepest well in the world will soon
be completed near Pittsburp, fa. It is new
more than one mile deep, and when fin
ished it may reach down two miles into
the earth. It is being bored in the inter
est of science. Th* object in penetrating
so deeply is to determine just what the
interior ot the human footstool is lite.
From a commercial point of view, the
well was a success long aeo. A compara
tively few feet below tne surface both s:as
and oil were struck in payinc quantities,
but the company owning ilie plant deter
mined to dedicate it to science, and in
vited Professor William Hallocx of Co
lumbia College to carry on a series of
temperature investigations as the hole is
carried deeper and deeper into the earth.
The results of these investigations are
very interesting, and it is the opinion of
several well-cnown scientists tiiat the ul
timate result of the boring will prove to
be of widespread economic as well as of
scientic value. Most significant oi all, the
facts so far ascertained is that the well
grows steadily hotter as its depth, in
creases.
It is the intention of the company to
continue the boring process until some
thing entirely new and original is de
veloped. This may seem a crude way of
putting the statement, but it has long
been a theory among well men that if it is
possible to go deep enough some new
geologic condition or economic feature
would be found to exist. At tbe very least
they claim natural steam would be en
countered, or the well-walls would finally
become so hot that water could be pumped
down cold and pumped up in tne form of
steam, and thus tbe natural power of the
future be obtained. At any rate, there is
material for much speculation and the in
terest becomes greater in increased jatio
as the drill descends, and a startling event
is expected to happen almo-t any day.
One remarkable feature of the well is that
the gas found near the surface is rfow used
to operate the powerful engines which do
tne drilling. Thus the natural power al
ready issuing from the weli is utilized for
the purpose of deepening it.â Washington

office shall hereafter pay for its printing
out of the appropriation for such office, as
Governor Budrt wishes to be done, and
that the State Printing Office, being with
out funds and unable to create a deficiency,
must be closed. It means also that the
State officers must do their printing on
typewriters or resort to the time-honored
goosequill.
In his opinion, Fitzgerald says no print
ine can be done for the State outside of
the State Printing Office at Sacramento,
nor can thia printing be done under any
other superintendency than tnat of State
Printer Johnston; and, further, no con
tingent appropriation and no iund in any
State department can be used to pay for
the printing of that department done in
the State Printing Office or elsewhere. In
consequence, Colgan can but refuse to
draw a warrant for the printine of any
office done elsewhere than at the StatÂ«
Printing Office.
This ruling of the Attorney-General is
directly in opposition to the Gorernor'a
view of the matter. He has stated that
in his opinion the contingent fnnds of the
various offices could be used for printing
purposes. The result is that as the State
Printing Office must close for Jack of
funds, the State Board of Examiners hav
ing declared that no deficiency will he
allowed to be created, in the future all
the State officers will be compelled to do
their own printing on typewriters, which,
without doubt, will result in clogging the
workings of every department of the
State.
In his letter to the Attorney-General,
Controller Colgan said:
In the general appropriation act of 1597
(cnapter <. (XLLI, laws 1897) are included the
hems : "For salary of Superintendent of State
Printing. ijH>O<X>; for support oJ State Printing
office, etc., $275,000." These items were ob
i jected to and uot approved by tha Governor,
and his reasons therefor are fully Â»et forth in
his message aicompunying the approval of tne
bill. In reciting his objections to the first
item above mentioned occur* tne loilowing:
"No harm can be done by th;s elimination,
for each department of the state can, in case
of necessity, out of its appropriation, pay ior
such printing as it has done at the State Print
ing Office or el&ewnere; and, if ihey did not
have such power, there is no doubi that under
the act of 1893 (Statutes 1893, page 233) a de
ficiency could be created in ineir contmeent
or other fnnd, or for ihe support of the State
Printing Office, that would authorize all of the
Plate printing nocesbary."
The Superintendent of State Printing is a
statutory officer, elected by the people of the
.State, and gives bond tor the faithful parforni-
Hnce of his duties, which are prescribed by the
Political Code, sections 526 to 538 inclusive.
Section 531 (1891) provides that be shall have
the entiru charge and superintendence of
Piate printing. Section 538 provides that all
State printing shall be done in the State Print
ing Office.
In tiiefaceof these plain provisions of the
law can any Stale printing be legally done
elsewhere tnan in the state Printing Office
and under the supervision of the superintend
ent of state Priming? and can any portion of
the coutiuge.it lunds or contingent appropri
ations of nhy Stale institution, commission or
officer hi legally used in payment of any State
printing done e.sewhere than in the State
Printing Office?
In his reply Attorney-General Fitzger
ald, after calling attention to the acts
creating aud regulating the State Print
ing Oittce, says:
I am of the opinion, from a thorough con
sideration of ail of these provisions, that the
Suite Printing Ofliee is a separate ami inde
pendent department oi the Stute government,
ior the support of whlcn an appropriation
wust be specifically made; that the "con
tingent expenses" of the other State oflices
and departments referred to In the appropria
tions made for that purpose include only the
ordinary running expenses ot those offices
and departments, and not State printing, for
the doing oi wnicli a special department has
been creuted and must be specifically supplied
with funds for its support, and mat, there
fore, no p.iri of the appropriations irmde for
the support of "each department of the State"
can be used to pay for priming done at the
State Printing Office.
A\ to the second question to be de
cided, viz. : Can any portion of their ap
propriationa be used by State officers,
board?, conimissior.s or other cepart
ments for the purpose of having their
necessary printing done elsewhere than
in the State Printing Office? the Attorney-
General replies:
This question la answered in the negative by
the exprt-ss provisions oi sections 531 and 538
oi tlie Political Coae, tne former of â which, as
we have seen, provides that the Superin
tendent of State Printing "shall have the
entire chargo and superintendence of the
State printing," and tho latter that "all State
printing shall be dove in the Slate Printing
Office."
In conclusion he replies in the negative
to the question, Can a deficiency be cre
ated for the support of the State Printing
Office?
Governor Budd, in commenting on this
opinion, said this, evening:
"I accept the oDinion of the Attorney-
General and am willing to see the State
baf.ine-s curried on on that bnsip, without
carrying the matter into court, as State
officers frequently do. Under this opin
ion, which I have been expecting and am
prepared to accept, the State of California,
in the matter of printing alone, will save
upward of $250 .000. The worlc heretofore
done by the Staie Printer â such as blanks,
reports, circulars, headings of boobs and
the like â can be got out by the mimeo
graph, the typewriter, the multiplex cop
ier, or in tho good old-fashioned way,
with pen and ink. This may inconveni
ence some of the clerical force employed
by the State, by requiring them to labor a
few hours more per week; the farmers,
merchants, property-owners and the tax
payers-of the State will De 'able to grin
and bear.it," in view of the saving of a
quarter of a million of their cood dollar:!.
"What can be done in this line was
shown by the last report from San Qnen
tin, which was made by the multiplex
copier. It may be that some of the print
ing; establishments of the State will deem
it proper to g*t up and carry in stock sach
forms as are readily salable and fre
quently used and dispose of them to the
officers of the Slate as stationery or blanks.
Such purchased can no more be objected
to than the purchase by the Attorney-
General or the State Librarian of books
and other printed matter gotten out by
private establishments. The State service
will in nowise be impaired, and the incon
venience and extra work required of Btate
employes wi!l be amniy compensated for
by the enormous saving which will result
to the people.
"If tha very expensive reports of State
officers heretofore published should be
deemed necessary the next Legislature
may make provision for them."

TIEDEMANN'S WITNESSES.
Judge Wallace Refuses to Summon
Persons Outside of This City
and County.
Carl W. yon Tiedemann is laying the
foundation for securing a new trial in the
event of his conviction of the crime of per
jury. He has through his attorney, Alex
ander Campbell, applied for an order of
court to Bubpcna a number of witnebses
from points outside this City and County,
and Judge Wallace has refused to grant
tbe request.
Following is the formidable list of wit
nesses submitted by Yon Tiedemann:
From San Jogeâ Dr. Ruth E. Newland, A-
Kieter, Jessie A. Christman, Mrs. Julia E.
Bush, John C. C. Russell.
From Brooks, Yoio Countyâ Mr. and Mrs.
George Patterson, John C. C. Russell.
From Los Angelesâ Joseph Stanton, Mary J.
Covert, James Johnson, John C. C. Kussell,
James E. Wells.
From Healdsburg. Sonoma Countyâ William
Paulson, John C. C. Russell.
From Angels Camp, Calaveras Countyâ
Windsor A. Keefer, John C. C. Rusxell.
From Bafcersfieid, Kern County â Jacob
Levin, John C. C. Russell.
From Oakland. Alameda Countyâ Hugh M.
Cameron, Charles F. Salmorreon, E. R. Tutt,
Miss Lena Tailleur. Mrs. Elizabeth Adtims,
Mrs. Clara Hansell, Herman Toelken, Mrs.
Emma N'orling Hansen, p. J. Donahue.
The name of John O. C. Kussell appears
several times in Yon Tiedemann'a list. It
is explained that he does not know the
exact residence of Mr. KussÂ«U and theie
fore seeks to find him no matter where he
live?.
Mr. Campbell appeared io be greatly
disappointed when Judge Wallace refused
to issue subpenas for the witnesses men
tioned. He informed the court that facts
had come to his knowledge indicating
that the prosecution in this trial was to
take a wider scope than was attempted on
former trials, and that he and big client
deemed it necessary to have these new
witnesses present in order to meet the
new phases of the prosecution's case.
The court ruled that it would be time to
consider theÂ«e new phases of the prosecu
tion when they arise in the coarse of the
trial and denied the motion.
HANLEY'S HARD LUCK.
Charged With Felony for Demanding
the Keturn of His Property.
A. A. Frledlander, a member of the
small army of Police Court lawyers who
infest tbe City Hail, exhibited remarkable
enterprise last evening in the interest of
one of bis clients, and as a result James
Hanley, a dry-goods mercbant of Oak
land, was momentarily detained at the
City Prison ou a felony charge.
Hanley is tbe man who, Thursday,
caused the arrest of Michael Brath, a
bootblack, for grand larceny. The latter
offense was perpetrated Tuesday at Ocean
View, and consisted of tbe aiealing of a
gold watch and a purse containing $70
from Hanley when the latter, induced by
a nard-luck story, consented to allow
Bratt to earn a nickel by blacking his
shoe*.
Yesterday Hanley, feeling Keenly the
loss of bis money, called upon Bratt's
father, who resides at 446 Clementina
street, and stated to t tie elder D.-iitt
that be was bard pressed for cash and
wanted his money returned. Bratt tola
him to call at o o f clock and the missing
property would be forthcoming. Pursu
ant to his instructions Hanley called at
the Bratt residence. The lather of the
bootblack invited him in and asked him
to state hia mission.
"I want my money back," declared
Hanley. As be said this Friedlamler, the
Police Court advocate, burst into the
room and placed rianley under arrest.
Poltcman Flynn responded to a call for
an officer and the Oakland merchant was
escorted to the City Hall.
Here the story of the arrest was detailed
to Detective Bainbridge, who was on of
fice duty, and the latter, failing to ob
serve any serious infringement of the law
in a robbed mnn demanding a return of
his property, refused to order his incar
ceration.
Thereupon Friedlamler exerted his
prerogative as a citizen and he himself
placed Hanley under arrest and escorted
him to the City Prison, where he put a
charge of attempted extortion against
him.
The merchant did not have to remain
in durance vile long. Detective Gibson,
who had worked up the case aeainst
young Bratt, became Indignant at Fried
lander's nctinns and he at onre called
upon Judge Low, who ordered Hanley's
release upon liia own recognizance.
Injured Wiiile Protecting Others.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 14.â An old man
named Enimons, who nas been a flagman
for the railroad company, was seriously
injured tins afternoon. He was flaging
one train and did not see another ap
proaching. He was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital with a fractured skuil and
may die. A year ago his son, Charley
Knimoii3, was killed near the same place
by a locomotive.
HOW MUCH WATER TO DRINK.
The Season of the Year and the Kind of
Fowl 1 aten Regulate the Demand.
According to Professor Allen we should
drink from one-third to twn-fifths as many
ounces as we weigh in pounds. There
fore, for a man weighing 168 pounds,
there would be required 5G to 64 ounces
daily, or from one and a half to four pints.
This the Journal of Hygiene regards as a
very indefinite answer.
The amount of water required depends
on the season of the year, the amount of
work done and the kind of fruit eaten.
In hot weather we require mora than in
cold, because of the greater Joss through
the skin, though this is In part made up
by the lesser amount passed away through
the kidneys. If a man labors very hard
he requires more than if liiÂ« labor is light.
A man working in a foundry, where the
temperature is nigh and the perspiration
profuse, not infrequently drinks three or
four gallons daily.
If the food is stimulating and sully ,
more water is required than if it ia blunu.
Vegetarians and those who use much fruit
require less water than those who c.v. salt
fish and pork, and often get along on none
except what is in their food. In moat
cases our instincts tell us how much water
to drink far better than any hard or fixed
rule. For ages they have* been acquiring
a knowledge of bow much to drink and
transmitting that knowledge to descend
ants, and if we follow them we shall not
go far out of the way.
It is of more use to us to Know that pure
water it essential, and that impure water
is one of the most dangerous of drinks,
than to know how much of it is required
daily. If one lives in ale ion where the
water is bad. it shonld be boiled and put
away in bottles well corked in an ice chest,
and, in addition, one should eat all the
fruit one cm, if fruit agrees. Fruim con
tain not only pure water, but salts which
are needed to carry on healthfully the
functions ol life.â The Medical Times. .
The first Railroad in America.
Gridley Bryant, a civil engineer, In 1826,
projected ihe first railroad in the United
States. It was built for the purpose of
carrying granite from the quarries of
Quincy, Mass., to the nearest tidewater.
Its length was four miteÂ«. including
branches, and its first cost $30,000. The
sleepers were of stone and were luid across
the track eieht feet apart. Upon rail â  of
wood, six inches thick, wrought-iron
plates, three inches wide and a quarter of
an inch thick, were spiked. At the cross
ings stone rails were used, and as the
wooden rails became unserviceable they
were replaced by others of stone.â Ladies'

Business Will Not Bo Completed
Before Tuesdayâ Next Place
of Meeting.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 14â Either
because of the delay of the principal del
egations in arriving or the attractions of
the city interfering with the serious busi
ness indoors the convention of the Order
of Railway Conductors will be prolonged
beyond its expected season, and it ia now
thought that the sessions will not cease
oefcre next Tuesday, after which the spe
cial trains will curry the people back
homeward.
The New York special train of Wagner
cats came in to-day w.th a large delega
tion, including many of tbe most promi
nent members of the order, bnt the Penn
sylvania train of Pullmans will not get in
until some time to-night or in the morn
ing.
The election of officers will occur to
morrow, according to oresont plans, and
will go through as slated, though a mi
nority sentiment favoring some cnanges
was discovered to-day among conductors
who are here as visitors and not as dele
gates.
On the subject of naming the place for
the next convention a good deal of cam
paigning is being done, the champions ot
Minneapolis, Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Quebec and other cities all working vigor
ously and offering all kinds of induce
ments, Minneapolis being slightly in the
lead.
The business session to-day lasted only
during tne afternoon, though the com
mittees were at work nearly all day.
Some proposed revision of certain clauses
in the insurance policies of the order is
receiving serious attention. It is under
stood that the grievance committee to-day
reported on certain matters directly bear
ing upon the situation on the Southern
California lines, where non-union con
ductors are now running trains, and there
was also a pointed communication on the
subject of Southern Pacitic train agents
and spotters.
Tne matter of paying rewards to con
ductors lor taking up "scalped ttckeis
was talked of, but no action was taken.
The principal business of the meeting
of the Ladies' Auxiliary this afternoon
was the election of officers. The grand
officers of the past year â Mrs. J. H. Moore,
president, and Mrs. \V. E. Higgins, secre
tary and treasurer â were re-elected. Mri.
Moore has Deen president for tne past live
years, and under her direction the order
has increased in membership from 400 to
2400 ai present. Mrs Moore organized
Angel City Division No. 84 in November,
L-',i.j, when she made uer n.-st visit to Cali
fornia. Since the lest meeting of the
Grand Division, two years ago, the presi
dent hits organized twenty-two divisions.
Her duties require almost constant travel
ing, and her popularity and efficiency,
combined with her magnetic power as a
speaker, make her a valuable president.
The ball to-night at Hazard's Pavilion
waÃ the greatest event of the kind ever
seen in Los Angeles. Before 9 p. m. fully
6000 people were in the great auditorium,
completely packing every inch ot space
except that reserved fox dancing. This
was intended by the local division to be a
grand demonstration for the visitors, and
it was a success in every particular. Some
of the interior decorations remaining from
the fiesta ball were visible, but tbe red,
white and green of the U. K. C. was made
to cover nearly everything. It was a rep
resentative company and a eood-natured
one, despite the fact of the crowded con
dition.
The Huntingdon floor drill was given
during the evening and c beautiful picture
was presented by the dark costumes, with
brilliant mortar- board*, winding in and
out of t lie intricate figures of the drill.
The supper- tables presented asieht that
was unique, even for this ciiy, and there
were many features about the function to
impress the visitors from a distance.
To-morrow will be passed in much the
same way as time was killed to-day â short
excursions everywhere.
One of the tirst delegations to leave will
be that which is known as the "Chicago
special." The party has at ranged quite a
trip eastward, taking in San Francisco
and Spokane, where great preparations
are beine made for tlieir reception. They
will go East over the Northern Pacific.

nowadays. Perhaps wishing never
did count. You must act. You
must get rid of your skeleton. You
must be boys no longer. You must
be a real man. Now, to return tÂ«
true manhood is no Â«asy project.
It requires will to make up yonf
mind. Then you have to select
the richt cure, the best cure, the
cure that will keep you cured â and
that's no easy task. Every butcher
who fails in butchering taires to
pilling. Every painter who fails
to paint signs for others paints a
doctor sign for himself and buys a
biz black hat. He needs the hat
as bad as the sign. It is a pity,
too. But, to return, you. want
your manhood a<;iin. Now, here
are 10,000 reasons in a single reason
why you shou'.d be cured by the
Hudyan remedy treatment â be-

HUDYAN HAS

Coast, and these 10,000 have writ-
ten 10,000 testimonials, and thene

Some of these testimonials nre on

BAN FKANCIECQ, CA4| #THE "PENCIL" WILL
A CIRCUMSTANCE
Admitted in Evidence on
That Ground in the
Fair-Craven Case.
Close ot a Most Important and
Lengthy Legal Argu
ment
The Ccurt Rules That the Will Is
Liabb to R j ctioa at a Future
Stage of tlie Proceedings-
The celebrated "pencil" will which Mrs.
Nettie E. Craven asserts was written by
the late Senator Fair in her house several
days after lie executed the so-called
"trust" wiU i s to be attacked by the attor
neys for the estate in the pending Fair-
Craven trial, along with the deeds which
the lady holds.
So rules Judge Slack.
The plaintiffs in this case, or, what
JUDGE CURTIS, the Celebrated New York "Wil- Smasher,"
Now One of Mr 3. Craven's Champions,
would be coming nearer the real truth, the
prosecutors â for some reason prefer to
center their assaults upon the will rather
than the main issue of the case â the dis
puted deeds. The defense has steadily
objected to the introduction of outside snd
collateral matters on purely legal grounds,
and declaring right along that if the court
ruled the will to be material the issue
would be met without fear of results.
"What the attorneys for Mrs. Craven ar
gued for was what they proclaimed to be
her rights under the law. The will, they
said, had nothing 10 do with the genuine
ness or spuriousness of the deeds.
The debate on this question consumed
two entire days. It was interesting
throughout and brilliant at times. True,
the court's decision apparently went
against the defense, but it has n string
attached to it, and the will may not prove
of much value to the side seeking to dis
credit it.
Tne court admits the document as being
a circumstance tending to connect wi.h
the main issue, inasmuch as it was writ
ten on tne day Mrs. Craven received me
deeds from Senator Fair. and. because it
was a part of the same transaction. Bat
the court also rules that the document
will be open to rejection iator in the trial
when certain new issues develop.
D. H. Delmas, citief counsel lor the de
fense, resumed ;;is argument as soon as
coun was formally called to order yester
day morning. He said he proposed to
draw a broad line of demarkation between
criminal and civil caac-s, where charges of
forgery are involved. There was a wide
difference. The other side had con
founded the physical fact of a forgery with
the intent to commit a forgery. Mr. Del
rrias declared that tne proposition of inter
est had no place in a civil suit wherein
fraud was charged. All that was neces
sary for the other side to do was to prove,
if it could, that Mr?. Qraven's deeds were
spurious,. The "pencil" will "iad nothing
to do with the ca*e. In civil cases, sucn
as this one, the controversy ends when the
disputed signature or document it either
proved to be genuine or bogus. But in
criminal proceedings it was very neces
sary and proper to show the interest of
the alleged iorger â the motive which
prompted the act. The "pencil" will, he
sai<i, was being introduced for no other
purpose than to attempt to show alleged
intent nnd with the hope of prejudicing
tbn vary.
The physical fact of a forgery, con
tinued Mr". D-lmas, cannot be proved by
showing tuat the ac.used person had com
mitted other forgeries. An exceptional
case would be where the accused admits
the forgery, but p:eadi that it was a mis
take or was committed innocently. It
would be necessary, then, to show jus:

what his interest wa3, and in doing so the
facts o: his having committed other for
geries could be shown. Bat if tha ac
cused denies the physical fact of the for
gery and proclaims the signature to be
penaine, then the physical fact must be
proved; and in a civil case the intent
would be wholly ii relevant. The introduc
tion of the will in this suit over two deeds,
said Mr. Delnins, would involve the case
with a great mass of collateral evidence,
but would only have the effect of divert
ing the minus of the jury from the real
issue.
Garret McEnerney interrupted once to
ask Mr. Delmas if he claimed that the
"pencil" will was genuine.
"I claim your averment that our deeds
are spurious is false â that is what I
claim," replied Mr. Delmas. "We will
prove 'hat, for that is what we came here
for. We have not been considering this
will as being any part of the case. W T e
have no interest in it. Some of the people
who are here loudest in their declarations
that that document is snuriou-i were only
a short time ago er.thusias'ic in their
claims of its genuineness. But we bene
fited in no way under ihat will and could
have no interest in it. We did not offer
it for pro! a'e. It was you gentlemen who
wanted it moat."
Mr. De! mas closed his argument early
In the afternoon session. He said he
would acquiesce to the court's request for
his reply to the plaintiffs' c<aim tuat the
pencil will was made admissible by virtue
of its connection with Mrs. Craven's de
position, al r Â«v\dy in evidence. The plain
tiffs had off ucd this deposition, he said,
and in doin;; so had under the law made
Mrs. Craven their own witness. The rule
was that the statements made by such a
witness bind the side bringing them out,
and those statements cannot . nen be made
an issue in the case. That witness' evi
dence could not be impeached by the par
ties producing that witness.
Mr. Delmas concluded by declaring that
the time and placs of the delivery of the
deeds did not constitute an is-sue in the
case. No more was the delivery itself.
Tne only issue, he said, was, "Is this the
j signature of James G. Fair and are these
acknowledgments genuine?"
Attorney Mitchell replied to Mr. Del
mas. He opened by referring to the cele
brated Sharon case and maintained that
the admission of the "dear wife" letters
i in that suit was authority for the claim that
the pencil will was relevant tesiimony in
this ease. He then took up the proposi
tion launched by the defense to the effect
that by introducing in evidence Mrs.
Craven's deposition made her the plain
| tiffs' witne-s aDd declared that this was
not good law.
In support of this he cited an Indiana
decision which went against the defense's
proposition. Mr. Mitchell said that as a
i matter of fact the plaintiffs had not of
i fered Mrs. Craven's deposition in evidence
as a deposition, but simply ac an admis
sion of certain alleged facts which they
desire to dispute. The attorney worked
himself up to quite an oratories! pitch as
he proceeded and wound up with a perora
tion in which he loudly proclaimed that if
given a chance he would prove nearly
every thing in >ieht a forgery.
Charles S. Wheeler, also of plaintiff's
line, followed Mr. Mitchell, going over
most of the ground covered by that gen
tleman.
Tuen Judge Danson closed for the de
fense, and it was a masterful summiug up.
It was quite evident, he said, that the
other side was in deep water and was
struggling hard to escape from drowning.
Charjes of bÂ»ing afraid to meet the will
hal been hurled at the defense, but this
was being done to cover up the fact that
the plaintiffs were afr.iid to meet the
depds.
Judge Slack rendered his decision off
haiwl, but promised to have something
morj formal for the record on Monday
mornint', to which time the court ad
journed.

four hours out the sailing vesÂ«el overtook
the steamer and the latter was flying sig
nals of distress. Just as the Caradoc's
lifeboat was making for the scene the
Tail went down and the entire crew and
passengers were left struggling in the
water. At one time there was 68 men in
the Caradoc's lifeboat, and when the
work of rescuing was done 75 people
were on the deck of the sailing-ship.
A black gig with the third mate and a
Creole woman in it was picked ud, and
the gie is still on the ship. A teak life
boat with five people in it was also
brought alongside and the men rescued.
For twenty-eight days Captain Junes had
to take care of the involuntary passengers,
and when be reached Calcutta he had to
pay for the boat* he saved at an auction
sale.
Another strike occurred on the water
front yesterday. Tne Bibb Lumber Com
pany's men walked out because tne rates
Had been cut. According to them the old
rate was only "liv.nir wages," wliile now
they cet 15 cents for every 1000 feet of
lurater handled on th â¢ wharf, and 25
cents a thousand if they send It to the
yard. When the men figured out the
matter they discover d Mint their best
day's work would not average more than
$1 50. The "walkout" then occurred.
New men have been put on the job of
discharging thÂ» lumber company's ships,
and unless the strike spreads to other
lines the men who would not work for
le-m than $2 a day will be out of work.
The Oceanic St-anship Company's
Alameda is at the sugar refinery taking in
coal for the return trp to Australia.
Chief Steward Clark of he vessel is a very
sick man and has not been able to visit
the Alameda for a couple of days. The
change* among the steamers consequent
upon Purser Button's retirement win be:
Purser Walton, now relieving Purser
Smith on the Mariposa, will rem.iin in
charge of that vessel, and Purser Smith,
now on leave of absence, will take the
Aiarneda on his return. In the meantime
W. J. Valey, freight clerk on the Oceanic
dock, will make one trip as purser of the
Alameda.
The old whaling bark Emma F. Herri
man has taken on a new lease of life.
Built in 1861 she has circumnavigated the
glote a dozen times, and up to a few
years ago was one of the most successful
whalers that went out of this port. When
the steamers came into power the wind
jammers went on the back shelf and very
lew of them are now heard of in Arctic
whaling. When the Herriman was taken
off the run H. J. Jorgensen bought her
for a son a and finding the hull to be
almost in as good condition asthodav
she was launched, decided to reb'iild her.
She is now a handsome barkentine and
an act ot Con/ress permits him to change
the name io the Leslie D. The new boat
will have her trial trip next week and
after that she will run in the lumber
trade.
The French steamer La Madeline will
start loading for Central American ports

the Mail Company and make a start for
home.
Two big gum for the fortifications on
the bay are being unloaded from Southern

The service is to be a m< ntnly one, as at

WELL-BACKED ONES
RUN UP TO FORM
Talent Enjoyed a Success
ful Day at Emery
ville.
Atticus at Odds of 25 to I Was
the Only Winning
Outsider.
Patsy Freeman Pilot d Two Winners.
The HjuVily Played Una Colorado
Won Cleverly.
The card at Emeryville yesterday was
made up of seven well-filled running
events. The attendance was large, and as
three favorites, three second choices and
an outsider captured purses most oi the
talent quit well ahead on the day's specu
lating.
The even-money choice, (Jlaudiana, in
the opening six furiong selling run, did
not seem to be overall! cted witn speed,
and was beaten out rather comfortably by
the 25 to 1 shot Atticus, ridden by Car
berry. F.ambeautte led to tne stretch,
where she blew up. Cheridab, a 100 to 1
shot, finished in the show.
Unsuccessful in the opening event Patsy
Freeman had more luck in the seven-fur
long splint that followed. With the mount
on the 8 to 5 favorite, Nebuchadnezzar
he made all the running, and hard pressed
at the end by the 15 to 1 shot, Mo. lie R,
got the verdict by a head. Thelma, piloted
by Joe Pissott, was a distant third. Ben
bam was uncorked and finished fourth.
Bergens' colt Taranto closed a slight
choice uver Alma in the betting on ihe
six and a half furlong sprint, that was
third on the card, but could not land ibe
purse. Clawson, on Alma, took the lead
from Reel on entering ihe stretch, ana
under the hard urging the mare beat the
favorite out a coup.c of lengths. Ana
bosis, a 30 to 1 outsider, played down to 10,
was a close third.
Dick, the even-money favorite for the
four-lurlong scramble for two-yesr-olds,
drew the rail position, and beating his
Held away from the post a couple of
lengths led turougnout and won handily
from Lord Marmion, the second choice, in
:H" .:. St. Calatiue, a6oto 1 shot, ran into
shuvv.
Galen Brown's mare fell in with easy
company in the mile and a furlong. After
opening at even, b-r odds gradually went
back until Bto 5 was freely obtainable. A
warm tip was prevalent on Billy McClosky,
out be disappointed bis Iriends. Tut la
vorite took the lead in tne stretch and,
ridden out, : owned Japonica over a length
in I:o~l4- Billy McClosky ended up in
third place.
The mile ran, next decided, afforded
some fast and fluctuating betting. Na
ranja opened favorite at 8 t.i 5, but so
much coin went in on Sallie Clicquot, imp.
Trance, Veiox and one or iwo oi the
other starters, that the first choice's price
receded to sto 2. Gus Wilson sent Sallie
Clicquot out in front and the Salvator mare
was never caught, winning bard ridden
half a length before imp. Trance.
Patsy Freeman earned more laurels in
the tinal race of the day, a six and a half
iurlong sprint, for wnich Horatio was
made a 7 to 2 choice. The latter raced
with Trappean to the stretch, where both
became groggy. Opposite the paddock
Freeman came with a rush on Una Colo*
rado and led King William past the
judges by three lengths. Marionette, a
150 to 1 shot, was third.
NOTJCS.
This is final day of the regular racing
season. Four days of the sport will be

Isidore Simon confessed to a weakness
for fishing excursions yesterday. He was
testifying in his own behalf and swore
that he was angling lor finny denizens of
the briny deep at the time L. D. Meggison
swore he was loitering in the neighbor
hood of J. F. Turner's offica on Mont
gomery street at 9:15 or 9:30 o'clock on the
10th of last month.
Simon was a juror in the case of J. F.
Turner, charged with unlawfully obtain
ing poR-Â«siion of a valuable deed to real
estate. Eleven members of the jury voted
for a verdict of guilty, but Simon Biood
out for acqnitta .
At tbe close of the trial the court was
startled by accusations against Smon. Ii

concerning the case before the trial Was
concluded in court, and that he had been
seen loi ering about the office of the de
fendant before t lie rate was submitted to

â how cause why he should not be punished
fo r contempt of court.
Attorney Echeli said yesterday that if
this were true it would tend to impeach
Simon's character as a citizen and juror,
bscause it mipht be deemed an indication
that his clientwas seeking a bribe from
the defendant. Foitnnately, however,
he was able to disprove Mecgison's story.
Simon swor* t hat on tlie date mentioned
he and J. B. McLaren went fishing on the
Oakland wharf. He said that he leit his
home in the Mission that morning and
went directly to the Oakland boat wh.cti
left at 9 o'clock and that he was rot on
Montgomery street that day. J. B. Mc-
Laren corroborated this testimony in
every particular.
L. S. Meggison reiterated his story
about seeinp Simon loitering in the neigh
borhood of Turner's office. He declared
that he took particular attention of the
matter because he knew Simon was a juror
in the case and thought it looked
suspciouÃ. An effort was made to ascer
tain what took place in the jury-room,
but this was not allowed by the court*.
Deputy District Attorney B ack and
Mr. Schell seamed disposed to submit the
case without argument, but JuJgo Wal
lace said he deemed it an Important
matter, and so the law and the facts will
be discussed by counsel next Friday.

In ita jubilant review of the progress
made on the construction of the new
railroad from Sissons to Fall River, the
Tidings takes occasion to declare that its
corresnondent was "permitted to enjoy a
ride on the first train that went out over
the new road by the courtesy of the su
perintendent." Probably the Tidiiigj is
in error. If anybody ever enjoyed the
first ride over a new load it must have
been by tho courtesy of a benign Provi
dence.
The Los Angeles Voice lifts itself to re
mark that "it seems quite fashionable
just now in Cal.fornia to sue newspapers
lor libel." It maybe quite fashionable,
but as compared with wearing sealskins
and diamonds it has nothing to recom
mend it in ilip way of cheapness. In fact,
the deplorable cost of the "fashion,"
added to the discomfort of invariably hav
ing the "Jibelous" utterance against you
pronounced justifiable and appropriate
by a jury of twelve unprejudiced men, is
rapidly carrying it out of styie.
WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN.
The event of the day so far as the peo
ple of the United States are concerned will
b6 the dedication of the grand monu
ment lo Washington ai Philadelphia. The
interest excited by the ceremony on that
occasion will have its influence on all the
people of the country and indirectly af
ler.t the enterprise of erecting a monu
ment to Lincoln in this City. Patriotism,
aroused by the memories of Washington
and the inspiration drawn from the node
monument at Philadelphia, will tend to
promotethe erection of similar memori
als to great men in all the principal cities
of the country, and we cannot fail to ben
efit by the success which has been achieved
elsewhere.
It is altogether right and fitting that
such monuments should be raised to those
men who by their services have advanced
the welfare of the people and augmented
the grandeur of the Nation. Such monu
ments appeal to two strong instincts of
the human heart, the instinct of hero
worship and the instinct of artistic expres
sion. Itisinevitabie, therefore, that monu
ments which are at once patriotic and
artistic should be raised in all civilized
countriÂ»s, and as a matter of fact we not
infrrquondy judge me civilization of a
community iesi by its works of purely
material than by what it has accom
plished in the line of monumental art.
The development of ths artistic instinct
of the American people has been one of
the most noiable feature* of our National
life during the last quarter of a century.
This development shows itself in every di
rection. It is to be seen in all branches of
our architecture, from homes to office
buildings, and in all departments of civic
energy, from the laying out of parks to
the construction of municipal edifices.
We have become an artistic people, and
while we have not as yet attained to the
level* of some of the great nations of
Europe, we are advancing with a rabidity
which nssure* that we shall not long be
behind even the foremosi in the race.
In monumental work in this country
the commemoration of Washington, Lin
coln and Grant naturally holds the first
place. The great mausoleum on Riverside
drive wiil probably remain the most
important monument to Grant for all lime
to come, while the noble monument
which Philadelphia dedicates to-day will
add another to our artistic memorials
to Washington. There remains to be
erected a monument to Lincoln which will
be worthy of his great fame and not
unequally classed with the monuments to
Washington and Grant.
It is perhaps too much to hope that Lin
coln's finest monument will be raised on
this coast, but it is not beyond the reacti
of our patriotism and our State pride to
attempt to make it so. In our efforts to
raise a fitting memorial to the martyred
President we oucht to b9 able to count on
assistance from all parts of the Union, and
will probably receive help in proportion to
t; c work which we do ourselves. It is to be
trusted, therefore, that the influence
exerted by the areat monuments raised in
New Yors and Philadelphia will have a
potent effect in California, and that sub
scriptions to the Lincoln monument to be
erected in Golden Gate ParK will be
liberally and speedily forthcoming.
UNDEEGfiOUfID WIRES.
The conference held on Thursday be
tween Mayor Phelan and a committee of
the Board of Supervisors with citizens
representing the various interests in
vclve;l, concerning the feasibility of hav
ing all electric wires removed from poles
and buildings and placed in underground
conduits, rpsu;t?d in an agreement as to
the ac'.v.sal il.ty of the plan and was tJius
far in every respect satisfactory.
It is particu'arly pleasing to note that the
telegraph, light and power and other com
panes operating wires showed no opposi
tion to the plan. This gives us reason to be
lieve that It will be easy 10 devise means for
carrying it out which will be satisfactory
to all concerned, and the City will be thus
enabled at a comparatively small cos*, and
within a comparative y short time to ac
complis i this much desired municipal im
provement.
It was the opinion of members of the
conference that nothing should be under
taken in the work, nor any attempt made
to fix a plan for carrying it out, until the
subject has been thoroughly considered
by a competent expert. This of course
was altogether risht and proper. While
many cities in the East and in Europe
have all wires of this kind laid under
ground it would be inadvisable for us to
follow the exact methods of either of
them, inasmuch as the circumstances here
are not the same as they are in any other
locality. The work of an expert is there
fore necessary, and the first question to
arise in the undertaking is that of select
ing a man who will be satisfactory not
only to the Supervisors and >o the various
companies, but will have the full confi
dence of tlie people.
The movement for this great improve
ment to the City has been so well started
that the people will be inclined to support
it almost universally. It is to be hoped
the problem will not be complicated by
factional antaeonism, or by an opposition
that is either selfish in disposition or Silu
rian in nature. The best laid plans for pub
lic work can be easily made to go awry by
stirring up dissensions through appeals to
jealousies or false economy. This danger
the public should endeavor to ruard
against as far as possible. The work has
been well begun, and it ought to be possible
to find an expert who will do his share
with credit and provide a way by which
we can get all these obstructing wires off
the streets where they now constitute a
menace to life and property as well as a
disfigurement of the City.
LIGHT AT LAST.
l"n less all reports from Washington are
unfounded we are likely to have light at
last given from official sources upon the
situation in Cuba. It i* probable that the
recognition of the independence of the
island will soon be tacen up as an imme
diate issue by the administration and by
Congress, and all prospects point to the
conclusion that the decision of the Gov
ernment will be favorable to the patriots.
The stories which have long been in cir
culation that dispatches from General Lee
were smothered in the Stite Office during
the Cleveland administration seem to be
well foundei. It is now asserted that
these reports furnish to our Government
sufficient grounds for interference in the
war, even to the extent of taking part in
it ourselves, if that should b ? necessary to
compel the Spaniards to treat the Cubans
in accord with the principles of civilized
warfare. It will be remembered t.i.it in
his last message to Congress Cleveland
sated that Spain milst not expect the
United States to remain always indifferent
to the condition of affairs in Cuba, and it
now appears that he had more than suffi
cient reason for givinz the warning.
Under the lead of Snator Foraker the
Committee on Foreign Relations has re
cently pone over all the reports from Cuba
and has discovered therein a most deplora
ble state of affairs regarding not only the
conduct ox the Spaniards toward the Cv

bans, but their unjust oppression of
American citizens in the island. The
lives and property of Americans bave been
repeatedly threatened and not infre
quently sacriliceil. Destruction is declared
to have been carried on everywhere, and
murders, outrages and starvation are said
to be matters of daily occurrence.
As n result of these investigations there
have been earnest conferences between
the members of tuo Committee on Foreign
Relations ana the Secretary of State and
also with the President. These confer
ences constituted the chief political events
of the day in Waaliineton on Thursday,
and while they were, of course, of a secret
nature enough has been made known to
encourage the most sanguine hopes of
those who have long desired the active in
terference of the United States Govern
ment to put an end to the wasteful anu
cruel hostilities in the island.
T c Morgan resolution on Cuba is to be
taken up next Tuesday and in the debate
on it it is more than likely that the public
will be fully informed of the whole situa
tion as it is seen by our official representa
tive in Cuba. It is also probable that
some deiinito conclusion will then be
readied by the Senate and the adminis
tration will be authorized to deal with the
issue with force and effectiveness. Day
light seems about to dawn for the strug
gling patriots who have fought so lone
for the independence of their country.
Spain has now exhausted all her resources
in a vain attempt to conquer the island,
and if the United States should now in
tervene to prevent a useless and cruel con
tinuance of the war it .seem- clear that
peace and independence will be attained
by the Cubans in a t me much speedier
than once seemed possible.
FBEBIDEMIAL TOURS.
President McKinley is said to be almost
overwhelmed with invitations from all
parts of the country to attend celebra
tions, expositions and various other oc
currences of local importance. So num
erous are these requests for his presence
at some time during the coming summer
that if he should undertake to comply
with them all his time would be wholly
occupied in traveling from one place to
another.
In a country so large as this, and among
a people so given to grand gatherings of
various kinds, it would of course be nu
poisibie for the President to accept all
iha ii.vitationa givjn to him. He cannot
show himself at dozens o plices from
Maine to California and from Minnesota
to Texas in a single summer. Ni-Terthe
less it will be well for him to attend as
many of tbese great local assemblies as
possible, for a President of the United
States can never too frequently meet the
people nor come into too close touch with
tuem.
When Washington b?gan his first term
as President of the United States it was a
matter of grave discussion in nis Cabinet
whether a President should undertake a
tour of the country at times when Con
gress is not in sess.on. It was concluded
that he should, and notwithstanding all
the disadvantages of travel in those days
Washington did undertake extensive
visits throughout the whole length of the
Union as it was at that time.
The esanip.e set by the lirst President
ought to be followed by every President.
If the country is larger now ihan it was
in Washington's time the im roved facili
ties lor travei have more thau compen
sat a for the increased distances. It
would be easier fur McKinley to come to
the Pacific Coast ihaa it was for Waahing
ton to go to Boston. Presidential tours
should therefore Le counted among the
duties of the office. It ad is to the urgu
raent that in i. ! owing the example of
Washington McKinley would depart from
that of Cleveland.

IF TURKEY HAD LOST?
Had the present war in Europe gone against Turkey another Sultau would probably have
risen to the Ottoman throne. There is "another Sultan" all ready to take the seat of power at
a moment's notice.
This is Murad, the brother of the present ruler's father. He was Sultan of Turkey for a few
rapid montns twenty years ago. Then, as the result of a conspiracy hatched against him by
his brother and the latter's followers, he was deposed and thrust into jail, whete he has
languished ever since.
During all the years of his incarceration ne has been a reconspirator In the game, which
at present has been on the under side of the wheel. Nor has he been conspiring alone or
with certain futility, His favorite wile volunteered to share his cell with him in the long
ago. She was more ingenious than he and the more readily contrived with her mother wit to
hold communication with and insure the co-operation of a league of confederates on the
outside.
Fuses have been made, trains of powder laid with infinite caution, and as the years co by
the schemes of reconstruction and ultimate explosion into fiery life are approaching nearer
and nearer to perfection.
The thread of this slow but pertinacious weaving of a new robe of power for the imprisoned
Sultan has been treated with the profoundest admiration and faith by John Bonncr, who will
present the story as he views it in to-morrow's Call.
The old countries still have the advantage over the new in the matter ot inter
esting landmarks. What natural wonder excites the awe of man as much as does the
eviden?e of a human achievement in the prehistoric ages which could not be duplicated by
all the ingenuity and knowledge of modern science or modern median cal strength?
Take the old monolithic churches In Abyssinia, for example. They are buildings
cut out of a single piece of rock. Their roofs are on a level with the
surface of the ground, which is to say that the buildings are carved out of the rock below the
ground, leaving a trench all around each one of them as deep as the building is tall. Borne
more of these marvelous churches have recently been found, and a long description of them,
together with drawings from photographs taken on the spot, has been prepared for The
Sunday Call from letters and data sent to La Nature, a French journal of contemporary
information.
The modern ideal of a building, of course, inclines to tallness. The higher the structure
the more wonderful it seems. And, indeed, if the ancients did beat us on churches, as in the
case of the monoliths, wo can beat them on tall office buildings.
We put up a structure almost ns high as the pyramid themselvesâ which are not offico
buildingsâ on a foundation of infinitely smaller area. Jusi how we do this is described wiih
close suieution to details in to-morrow's Call. A picture of the five tallest business structures
in the world will accompany the article.
Nor is the new world without its historic oddities. Mexico is rich with relics prehistoric
and otherwise, and to the latter order a valuable addition has just been made in the discovery
of the long-lost death cast of Napoleon I. There were five of these casts made from the original
mask taken in plaster at St. Helena, where the Little Corporal died and hitherto the where
abouts of but four of them nns been known. Tne fifth unaccountably disappeared soon after
it had been made. A few weeks apo it was discovered in Mexico under rather odd circum.
stances, the details of which, combined with a photographic reproduction of the cast itself,
will lorm one of the features of The Call to-morrow.
Returning acrcss the Atlantic for out-of-tne-way objects of Interest a happy thought leads
us to explore after .he famous suicides' graveyard at Monte Carlo. Many travelers have
positively denied that such an institution existed, having missed it In their sight-seeing
tours; but it does exist nevertheless. A Call writer has been inside of it and has conversed
with Old Gilbert, the nondescript individual who takes tare of it. Sketches of the ground and
of the old man, with some clear descriptions ol both, will be published in the coming
Sunday Call.
Two otner European wonders are Salisbury Cathedral and the temple of the Druids, both
of wliich are described and sketched for to-morrow's Call by the clever ban Francisco girl,
Miss Heineman, who is now studying art in London.
Personages, as well as inanimate objects, are interesting. Walt Whitman, Charlotte
Cushinan, Stephen A. Douglas, J. T. Trowbrldge. Artemus Ward and other celebrities of their
day were and are still subjects for more than ordinary remark. But a great
accession of interest is derived from the fact of a little girl doing the talking about
them. Tbe daughter of Elizabeth Akers Allen, author of the well-known "Rock Me to Sleep,
Mother," is now a woman grown in San Francisco. In those days she was the little girl friend
( f ihe celebrities above mentioned, and this week she has prepared a review of them as they
appeared to her as a child. The Call will print these impressions to-morrow.
Muriel Baily went out last week to discover who does the washing for the soldiers at the
Presidio. There is no laundry there, and very little "washing" is s*Â»nt to the City laundries.
What remarkable system for doing the work our contributor discovered will be related In a

The subject of continuing the B'ne B'rith
Library lihk been discussed in the different
lodges of this City and the feeling is that it
should be continued and its usefulness ex
tended. One complaint against the library has
been that there are too many works of fiction
on the shelves and not enough works of refer

the number ol works lor which there is now a
demand. It has vow about 12,000 books on
the shelves.

TRIUMPH OF A
FREE PRESS
Editor Marriott's Acquittal
Warmly Greeted by a
Contemporary.
Judge Hebbard's Recourse to the
Secret Tribunal o! the Grand
Jury Fruitless.
Twelve Cit zens Braved Judicial
Wratb and Declared for the
Caose of Justice.
Editor Fred Marriott of the News Letter was
triumphantly acquitted by a jury of his peers
last night, says the Bulletin of last night, of a
charge of libeling Superior Judge Hebbard,
alter a trial lasting over four weeks. After
only three ballots the young editor's conduct
was vindicated.
As is generally well Known, tho case ivas
based on an indictment of Marriott for the
publication in the News Letter of an editorial
criticism of Judge Hebbard's course in the
People's Bank cases and declaring that the
Judge was the "creature and tool" of design
ing persons and, consequently, a "disgrace to
the bench," "unfair" and "incompetent. 1 It
was purely a campaign article, such as any
newspaper may puDlish, such es all the voters
in the City desire snail be published. It pur
ported to tell the truth about a prominent
candidate for election to political honors. To
some extent it missed its mark, lor the object
of the criticism was elected by a large vote.
Yet months after his day of triumph the
Judge presumed to press a criminal charge
against the man who lifcd criticized him. To
the credit of the people, to the glory of liberty
and iree speech, the attempt ignomintously
failed.
For four solid weeks Judge Hebbard un
necessarily neglected his duties to watch the
proceedings before Judge Daingerfleld and a
jury. For all that time his courtroom doors
were closed, and Judge, clerk and shorthand
reporter were to be found in a body eagerly
watching the turns of the case. Judge Heb
berd tven acted as associate counsel lor the
prosecution, and suggested points to Julius
Kahn or to Walter Hinkle, the one his private
counsel, the other the assistant District Attor
ney, representing the State. All his friends
neglecttd tbeir business to attend the trial,
including General John F. Sheehan, the one
time receiver of the People's Bank, and Jnmes
If. Watt, his attorney. Marriott sat alone, save
for his counsel.
The trial has been described from day to
day. The prosecution's case rested upon the
fact that Fred Marriott was the proprietor of
tho News Letter, and that on such and such a
date the article complained of appeared in his
paper, published and authorized to be pub
lished by him. It took but a short while to
present the facts c.aimed. The defense, how
ever, was not content with a single denial or
plea in justification. With the greatest care
and patience Attorney S. M. Sbortridge, whose
handling of Marriott's case was briiliaut, had
collected all the facts ana circumstances con
nected with the management, or rather mis
management, of the bank's affairs for the time
the defunct concern passed iuto Receiver
Sheehan'a hands to the day when he received
his discharge.
Several facts were shown despite the per
sistent adverse rulings of the court. It was
shown that Judge Hebbard had in the first
instance appointed Sheehan as receiver of the
bank; that tho appointment was subsequently
declared illegal ; that some weeks afterward a
second suit was brought and Sheehan again
appointed receiver, this time legally; that
during the term of his illegal apoolntment
Sheehan receive! his salary of $500 a month.
It was shown that when Sheehan took charge
the majority of all the old board of directors
were willing to resign if permitied to meet for
that purpose, and that Sheehan and Watt, by
tbeir machinations, prevented the meeting
and also controlled the voting of the stock. It
was also shown that Judge Hebbard at one
time agreed to allow the directors to meet for
the purpose of resigning p.nd when called
upon to do so went back upon his promise.
All the workings of the bank were gone into
in minute detail. Hebbard's employment of
John Gamage, the private detective, who
failed to materialize when called upon, was
inquired into. ThÂ« mass-mee'.ing of angry
depositors at tho Bush-street Theater, where
Judge Hebbard, Sheehan and company forced
their way in with the aid of a policeman,
received due consideration. Laity the course
taken by Judge Heboard in going before the
Grand Jury and securing the inaictmeut ot
seven depositors who bad been rash enough to
send a circular round to the voters warning
them as to what kind of man they were asked
to caÂ»t their ballots.
With all the acts of Receiver Sheehan, with
all the acts of Attorney Watt, Mr. Shortridge
claimed, Hebbard must have been familiar.
The court had the power of appointment; it^
was the court's duty ;o see that its appointees
did their duty faithfully and well. Had the
court done ihat? There was no suggestion in
Mariiott's article, there was no suggestion
made by Mr. Shortridgo that Hebbard was dis
honest; it was merely claimed that he had
been careless and weak; that he bad been a
creature and a tool of others, and for that rea
son was a person unfit for the position he
sought to occupy.
Judge Hebbard, It was expected, would take
the stand in rebuttal and explain what mat
ters looked doubtful. But he did not do so.
He did not face the ordeal. To the astonish
ment of all the case was permitted to close
witnout a word from the man who was really
on trial, although, technically speaking, an
other roan sat for the time being in the de
fendant's chair. So the case went to the jury,
after a plea from Walter Hinkle, a scathing
denunciation of arbitrary misuse of judicial
power and of unheard-of attempts to deprive
the American citizen of what he was most
proud ofâ liberty of speechâ by M-. Short
ridge, and a somewhat lame reply by Julius
Kahn, in which tho latter sought a verdict of
the jury sending Marriott to prison on the
ground that the prosecuting witness, Heb
bard, was "an honest man. 1 '
It took longer to arrive at a conclusion than
It would have done had not Judge Dainger
fleld elected to go to the theater. Two ballots
were taken before dinner. The first showed
ten jurora for acquittal, two for conviction.
Immediately after dinner the last man came
over, but Judge Daingerfield was at tne the
ater. Returning therefrom at 11:30 p. m. the
crowded courtroom heard the welcome words,
"Not guilty."
Justice had triumphed. Judge Hebbard
rushed out of the courtroom acd was no more
seen. Fred Marriott received the congratuls
tions of his friends. Tho twelve men who
braved juitclal wrath and declared for thy
freedom of the press were D. Farquharson,
Thomas G. Taylor, Adam Wagner, A. M. Law
yer, K. Gambltz, R. Kayser. D. B. Collins,
William Deeney, Willard Perkins, W. C. Kra
mer, Joseph Simon and Henry Levy.
AIRSHIP OF TfaE FUIURE.
St. Louis KÂ« pub Ie
Thoughtful persons saw more in the recent
airship excitement than the delusions of the
credulous and the jests of the practical Jokers.
It brought out the fact that many minds are
thinking of the problem of aerial navigation
and many practical inventors are trying ex
periments in that direction.
; Great inventions: which revolutionise the
methods of the world ore gradually diicov
end. The work or one man is Improved opon
by others. New I'ght is gained with regard
to the condition* to be met and the necessary
Â»teps to be taken to meet them, until the so
lution flashes upon an inventor and the task is
accomplished. / ; ' . . ;
There has been abundant evidence ' within
the past lew . yean . that we are approaching
the realization of the dream of the flying bir
chlne. Scientists have made progress In study
ing conditions of bir and mechanism, and
inventors have been gradually crrecting
errors and achieving better results. Tue pub
lic mind has been brought to the belief that
the problem ckii beso.ve :, and Hie exp< elation
has stimulated ii.vtsiigatlou and invention.
Although there may not yet be an airship
wnlch fulfills tne demands of aeral naviga
tion in the actual atmosphi re, yet there is an
airship in the intellecuiul atmosphere, which
is assuming tlie shape and taxing on tna
necessary parts wh.ch will make tlie real air
ship of the future. Many minds are contrib
uting to its construct. ou and are pushing it to
completion. It is not unreasonable to expect
thut the opening of the next cnury will rinl
the world in possession of a crude but prac
ticable structure, which will be ibe progeni
tor of the aerial greyhounds of tne future.
HO, TOR EL OAMPO!
To-Day thÂ« St Andrew's -Society Will

long distance. The place has now become
so widely known and generally popular
that nearly all Ihe leading social organiza
tions select it for their annual picnics.
These do not, however, interfere with the
regular Sunday patronage, as there is
abundant room for all. The San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railroad Company
has made a generous outlay in fitting Â£1
Campo as a desirable resort for the best
classes, and its efforts have met with grati
fying appreciation.

suspended and not having done anything
toward making explanation, was unani

The disposition of the fund taken in
at tne Olympic- Butte football match,
amounting to $732, caused a warm discus
sion. The board of managers authorized
the payment of the money to the Boule
vard General Committee and that com
mittee, without further warrant, divided
the money equally between tbe Olympic
Club, the Butte team and the boulevard
fund.
A resolution was passed censuring the
boulevard commit cc and authorizir. â¢ tho
new board of managers to take whatever
steps mizht be necessary to recover the
money and see it used lor its legitimate
purpose.
The treasurer presented a very flatter
ing report. The receii>;s for th = year
were: <"asa on hand $5 75. dues $217, ini
tiation $110, reiratta $387 50. swimming
touma:ne:U $47 15; total $707 40. Ex
pen-es $GU7 40, leaving a balance on hand
of $lbO.
Secretary West reported that there is
no foundation lor the rumors that the
association is being disorganized, and
President Humphrey said that the lead
ing ciub to withdraw was not unanimous,
as was proved by the application to-night
oi the Olympic Rowing Club and its ad
mission so membership. He declared
that the association is aDsolutely neces
sary to the preservation of amateur gport.
Howard Taylor, leader of the Olympic
Club, through the president, made a
statement tuat neither he nor any of the
directors of the club were responsible for
the statements made in the papers, and
stated that with certain chances in the
representatives of the board of managers
the Olympic would again join the associa
tion, and so would the other clubs that
had withdrawn.
The president stated that the Olymp c
duo had been assured that no advances
toward a reconciliation would be made by
the association. "The Olympic Club
seem' to think that we need them," said
Mr. Humphrey, "nut we do not, and we
do not fear them.'
A discussion took place on boxing and
Delegate Bowers of Sacramento wanted
more latitude than the rules a low. He
said $35 was too little inducement, es

THE LABOR COUNCIL.
It Addresses Certain Pertinent
Questions to the Labor
Commissioner.
At last night'a session of the Ban Fran
cisco Labor Council the following resolu
tion relative to Commissioner Fitzgerald's
vi-it to Hawaii was adopted and ordered
forwarded to him by Secretary Rosenberg:
Whereas, The Commissioner of Labor, Mr.
Fitz-iemid, upon his return from the republic
of Hawaii, in an interview coming from him
or purporting to come from him, and pub
lished in the dally press last w ednesday, pro
poses that American workingmen shall emi
grate to Hawaii ;
Resolvai, Tnat we ask bim to state whether
the contract lubor law of that country has
been repealed. Loes not that law provide for
specific enforcement of contracts to labor;
tnat is, does not the law in ihe republic 01
Hawaii provide thai anyone making aeon
tract to labor must fulfill such contract on
pain of imprisonment? Are not such con
tracts to labor generally enforced? Does not
enforcement of such specific contracts to labor
amount to slavery? If ilu-s.i laws are yet in
force, had not workingmen, though Idle, bet
ter wait before going to Hawaii until the au
thorities in charge of those island* shall re
spect, liberty sufficiently to repeal their slave
luws?
In discussing the adoption of the reso
lution Delegate Scott said he believed the
whole thing was a scheme in favor of an
nexation, that the islands would be filled
with Americans and uuon the occasion of
any trouble this country would be called
upon for protection.
A. Furuseth believed that there is
enough labor in this country to rill the
wants of every man, and that it would be
a wild scheme to emigrate to a new coun
try wnere men are now paid all the way
from $8 to $10 per n-.onth. He thoueh't
the questions were pertinent and should
be fully answered oy Fitzgerald betore any
action was taken.
Furuseth also reported the result of the
conference with tbe Governor in the case
of S. D. Worden. A wide discussion fol
lowed, but it was finally concluded that
pending the gubernatorial decision any
further action at this time might be pieju
dicial to his case.
A resolution was adopted encouraging
the Cigar-makers' Union in the attempt
to lessen the use of Chinese acd tenemont
male dears, and the members of the
council were called upon to use their per-
Honal influence to widen the use of tne
blue labei goods.
From a union firm cf Cincinnati was re
ceived a letter asking co-operation in an
effort to defeat the passage of a bill in
creasing by 2 cents the internal revenue
tax on tobacco. The -ecretary was in
structed to communicate in regard to the
matter with President Gompers of the
Ameri'an Federation of Labor.
The Sailors' Union reported that an ap
peal had been filed in tbe United States
Circuit Court from Judge Morrow"s deci
sion in the J. D. Peters case. This is the
ca*e in which the Maguire law was de
ciared as not repealing allotments lo sail
ors in the coastwise trade. The conten
tion of the seamen is that the allotments
co to boarding masters instead of to
sailor*.
Some desultory discussion was carried
on anent tbe Government ownership of
telegraph lines, but no action was taken.

Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald's O.ficial Report
Issued.
He Reviews at Great Length
the Cocd'.tion of Hawaiian
Affairs.
UaJer Certain Conditions He Thinks
th^ Japanese Wou d Control
th-- Islands.
Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald hrs
finished his o*licial report of his visit lo the
Hawaiian Islands.which will be printed in
pamphlet form and distributed by the
Chamber of Commerce. It is as follows:
My investigation throueh the Hawaiian Islands
has brought to my attention many new conditions
and phases of labor, the most Important of which
lsthu Asiatic honlesthat now iniest the islands
and predominates In numbers upon the planta
tions. 1 have seen about -0.0.j0 barefooted la
borers, half of whom work under a penal contract:
I have seen a reward offered for their arrest when
they violated ihelr contract and deserted thÂ» plan
tation, and tnelr number primed across their pho
tograph, in convict style: X have seen four or live
hundred Japanese walk ten mile.] to back up the
position of one man when only a few days' work
was Involved; X' have seen murder upon
the plantations and riot; I have heard the
Japanese say that their p>ople have brought
the sugar Industry to the position which it
now occupies and . thai they propose to hold
the controlling influence upon th? islands at any
hazard; 1 have si en them demanding in* white
men should be discharged and Japanese taken in
their place; I have seen one or our American men
of-war anchored in the harbor for the pun o eof
cltf ci iluii! the. planter against his own labor, and
I have seen the warship of Japan anchored at Its
side simply to encourage the Japanese upon the
Ulands in their airogant and Id so ent behavior
nil 1 to forth r demand t:iat mere siiould bs added
to the alr<:adv overbuidened condition, ".hat more
fuel b3 ajaed to tmÂ» flame"; I bkve seen the Gov
ernment deport 1170 of the lowest (trade of these
seils upon a technicality: I have seen the doveru
ment discriminate in its last contract In the build
ing of Â« public highway against i he employment
of femora than one half or Asiatic labor upon the
same, and 1 have found a majority of the planters
eager to welcome an >- chance that may bring the
Auglo-saxoii into their mid -I The Government
Is unqualifiedly trie ctiampionof merican lator;
the press aud the peope of the islands nearly to a
man are struggling to ben back a ho;de which
threaten their undo ngâ trying to free themselves
no it the grip of a monster. â¢
The only question whh them regarding the
Chan eof the, r labor for American Is: -Can they
stand the climatic conditions? ' Wi 1 they work
faithfully, and at sucli wages as will guarantee to
the planters a reasonable dlvldei-d upon, their
stock?"
There Is nothing in the climatic conditions
acalnst white labor performing the work and
drawing the three or four million dollars that Is
paid annually to the As atlcs, as the temperature
on the plantations rui.s no higher than ninety, and
atandi at an aye age of about seventy- i.ve.
Chinese till the positions of storekeeper*, clerks
in the lio;els, mlllnien, teamsters, etc. On the
plantations the number and nationality of labor Is,
by the last report: 16. ilawallans, ~'^6S ivrtu-
Riiese, 12,893 Japanese, 62Â«8 Chinese, and ulÂ» -ut I
716 of other nationalitiesâ a total of 23,781). The
Hawalians are the best workmen: the Portu
guese rank next, arm to-day are considered the
â bone ami sinew" of the Islands, as they are In- j
duslilous, quiet ana peaceable; the Chinese next I
and the Japanese las . It is my opinion that 15,- !
00U white people will do the work Of the 25,000 i
Chinese and Japanese now working upo i the
plantations. The Japanese are sow, careless, and
they work much after the style if a convict. \
Now, regarding the supplanting of those people
wi h Americans and their families, there 1* . noth- j
ing to hinder the same, it i.eini: a ques.lon or "a i
g od day's work fur a stood nay's pay '; but it must j
be dune systematically and gradually, as mere
in us- be great changes wrought b-'iuie Dili can bo [
accomplished. i.'i.- - iii.ii at it necessitates the
planters to build home* for them, etc. .There Is
one condition under which American labor should
be Introduced and which the pUnt a,ree- i
ab> to, and thai Is on a profit-sharing basisâ glv- i
ing to labor a certain Held where tea to 100 can
co-operatively cv i: .-.,;* the sume. It takes be
tween fifteen and eighteen mouths in which to
harvest the crop, a:. d the planters are perfectly
Â»i .iiiÂ£ to cdvan c them a monthly allowance of,
say between $16 and $20. to be deducted, without
interest, when the sugar is marketed. Tula in
cludes a home, witn land enough for garden pur
pose*, free fuel, water, and in many case.* pattur
age for a cow, with free schools, etc. Mottling
can better demonstrate how eager the planters
are to bring In a worthy claw of Americans than
the act thai they are willing to maintain a depart
ment in America that thli c.iange ma/ be brought
around systematically, so ilia*, only those who are
willing to work and' work faitafuily should go to
the islands ; also that no one should g<> o.i a'â¢ wl.d
goose chase" to Hud no worn for him, as there
must be a place made in advance for all who go.
The under ra:e of wages per da/ is somewhat orT
:et hi the fact that tne wor < goes on day In and
day out, year in and year out, an! the toiler need
never miss a day unless ne so desires. Ihavebeen
assured by the Government ant by President vole
thai it v their desire (and l have no douut but
that i: wil. b; iiic.ude.l in Ins recommendation)
that the Leg.siatnre should create Â« department
for the introduction of American labor.
I could have taken orders for many hundred
men, but I deem it thoroughly unwise In the In
terest or labor and ths planters to undertake this
In a slipshod, haphazard way. However, I wi.l
fill one or wo orders f->r about fifty men with
families. 1 had the pleasure of picking out the
snÂ« tor their homes ann atsistloic to draw- plans
for their housesâ a beginning that may mean the
end of the controlling position oc.tup.ed by the
Japanese upon the islands. I would not advise,
under i.ny â¢ ircuiu.* ances, that lab r be sent there
to be paid by the day at present, a< it may neces
si.at* i heir competing Â»i.ii the penal contract la
borers; but If they can be sent under a profit
sharing proposition, which I said berore the plant
ers are agreeable to. and if the s aDdurd of wage*
can b- m<tlntaln(d so as to u.aice it an object to
American laoor, Hawaii to-days open* thegieatest

There are now about 5000 acres coming under
cultivation and that 6000 at. C.i has done more to
bring in the Anglo-Saxon .liau ail th- other Indus
tries combined, it is naturally the pursuit of a
man with a family, us the iv to of labor increase!
in he picking time from aooiu 1 to 6 and 8, and
as the labor upon the plantations in other" indus
tries la being us*d at the same time the coffee
should be picked, there i* no snip us upon the
'Islands iroiii which to drawâ the sci.ool-children

lieve will lie in ctff.-e In a very Jew years, and the
amount of help necessary to pick this crop for
two or three months in the year will be enor
mous. ' â 
~ltegardlng what effect the abrogation of the
treaty will have, 1 Â»M Iriefly slat- that in my
mln i th" same would mean a deathblow to the
ntroductlon of Americans Into the Ha
wniUn lilr\nds, for the fact that the oniy thing
(hat remain* between lhÂ» absolute assurance of
the Americans supplant. Asiatic labor.' provided
the former proved satisfactory, is the wages to Da
paid, and if 40 per ce..t cr any pcrtion thereof
should be taken lrom the present nun, I should
advise the laborer to Â»iay at home, and the
planter will ii niloii btedly turn again to the AsiatUs,
lor it Is cheap labor. ...
There is an appropriation of 850,000 "to assist
immigration Other man Asiatic," to piy tue pas
ca^eof i.ih women and children taken under '-the
10 pei > cent 'â : <lÂ»use." In other words there
Is a regulation which compels the planter to im
port 10 per cent ' of all contracted labor from
America or Kurjpe.* The Govrrnmeut assured me
that they would g.adly spend the money in bring
ing th? fami.ies of the American*, and . they now
stand ready: besides, the pUnters will :â  advance
the passage money oi all who may be sent to them. I
It is useless for the .people of tuia country to a

Let 'Us see to what extent the sugar industry of
the Hawaiian islands interferes with the bee: in
dustry of California, of which I am as thoughtful
is any one. \, We have a v^s: consumption if
2,000,000, tons -a year li the United States, of
which we only produce about one-sixth, and the
Hawaiian Islands sends Into our markets between
200.000 Bin 250,000 tons, and in Californ a we
are producing not more than one-third of our own
consumption. 'This year, I understand, fully half
of the sugar ironi the islands will go to New York,
so at present I cannot sea where the sugar of â¢ the
.Hawaiian Islands hampers the beet-sugar Indus
try. Further ( than that, lei us see to what extent
protection of sugar will assist the producer and
the laborer. With the exception of one factory in
California and one in Utah the sugar industry of
the Unittd i?tate* Is practically controlled by the
sugar trust, and I have never Known it to be re
cor-lea where, any industry was at the mercy
of a trust that it ever received one cent benefit
f.om increase I prices Besides this, I have the
very best authority tor the statement that one
sugar beet factory In California, running 144 days
last year, paid 70 per cent dividends upon its capi
ta izai ion. , - < â¢ â 
The highest price paid to the beet-raiser for his
beet is 94 per ton, a .d until the manufacture of
sugar from the beets :Is banded by the Â» rower
they will never be allowed . more than a living
profit upon their toll. The reports of over fifty
large and small tactorleslu (jermanv show that to
mauufactur.i a pound of sugar from beets which
are bought at a price of 85- per ton (which Is $1
per ton more than our factories pay), and ii. elud
ing all interest on working capital and an annual
sinking fund lor repairs and ienovations, co is
iiVÂ» cents. X.c â me ass .me that we are able in
California to extract from the beets the same per-,
' centage in sugar as is uon- annually by the t>er
mau manufacturers, viz. l"jy a percent, not tak
ing into conslderat on that our beet* are richer. A
factory for the manufacture of ury while granu
lated and cube sugar ready to be so dto tbe con
j sumer without undergoing a process of refining,
' with a capacity of 300 tons of beets dally,
Coys approximately f 150 000
Bulidinss, etc.. aO '! J0 ,i
.Incidentals 60,000
Together $250,000
Fuch a factory will In the 100 days of its run
consume at least 30,000 tons oi beets, wh cli yield
12Va per cent or .->750 tons of whit- sugar, which
I will value at 4 cents a pound (Vi a cent 1< at than
I the very lowest quotation in this marKet at env
! period). This is $80 per ton for the whole 8750
tonsâ s3oo,ooo. ihe cost of production. accord-
Ing to German reports, is Â«%. to which I will add
the cost of tlie entire labor, viz., 100 men for 100
days at $t per day, $-0 000, and the cost or fuel,
viz., 8000 tons of coal at $6. $> 8.000, giving a total
cost of production of If SOU, which, deducted
from the <3U0.000, vaunt on of the sugar pro
duced, leaves us Â» profit $74,600. or almost tO per
! cent on the invested lapltal. which certainly
i pioves tne pos-iibility of overcoming the hish
! prices for labor and fuel. While these figures !
show th- aspect of the question from the stand
point or the manulactmer they plainly prove how
it is possible that many German factories have
I paid a prt-iit annually of 30 or more per cent of the
I tnves.ed capital for many years in succession.
i I was informed by Japanese of influence that
' they saw in the abrouoti.-n of the treaty a chance
j to acquire that which they have waited long and
j patiently for, viz : "the ownership of the pianta
! tio. s " They to d me thiÂ» plantations could not be
i cultivated lor a profit except- by their people, and
1 thai they will do li only lor their people; in other
I words, they are willing to purchase tin m at what
thyare worn to-day. However, they will de
mand that a lons lease be given to their Govern
ment or Pearl Harbor. It needs no words to paint
a mental picture of what will become of these
amis when once the Japanese become the em
oloyers of lie:p. he moneyed rower and the labor
itself. As a business proposition the planters
would naturuily dispose of their possessions and
lease the field to the undisputed influence of the
! subjects of the Mikado, who would be -'monarch of
a 1 tney surveyed " and instead of the heritage of
the islands going to the American people they would
go to the Japanese, â¢â¢forming a greater Japan.'

The next sporting event of importance
will be the dog show of the San Francisco
Kennel Club, which will open on Wednes
day at Mechanics' Pavilion. Doubtless
there will be many people going to the
docs next week.
The wheelmen will all join in the Wet
more outing to-morrow, as it promises to
be one of the great pleasure events of the
teason.
The Pacific Yacht Club will entertain its
friends this evening at the beautiful
grounds in Sausalito. The Corinthians
will have a race to Vallejo this evening
and will return on Sunday.
The Olympic Club will give a profes
sional tioxing entertainment at Wood
ward's Pavilion on Tuesday evening.
Other lines of sport, such as rifle shoot
ing, angling, coursing, rowing, baseball,
etc., are well patronized.
THE WHEELMEN.
The Bay City Wheelmen's Annual
Blithedale Run To-Morrow.
There are no races on the card for to
morrow at the Velcdrome, although a
meet is contemplated Sunday week. It is
just as well to give the racing end of the
game a rest anyway, or we will get tired
of it. Besides, this is the season of club
runs, and the Velodrome managers should
not be disappointed if some of the club
captains persist in leading their men out
into the open country, instead of toward
their place of amusement. The feature of
to-morrow in the sport is tbe annual run
of the Bay City Wheelmen to Blithedale,
arranged by Mr. Wetmore. It will prob
ably be attended by over 200 wheelmen.
Two meets are scheduled for the last of
this mouth which promise excellent sport.
The first is on Sunday, May 30, at San
Jose, and wilt be heia by the Garden City
Cyclers on their famed three-lap cement
track. It will be the first Sunday meet
ever held there, but as a free admission
exhibition meet in March, 1895, at the
tirae of the opening of the track, when
Jones broke the one-third miie world's
record, crowded the grounds uncomforta
bly lull, it is expected that the coming
meet will receive the support of the
cycling-loving public there as heartily as
the weekday meets have been In the past,
and every one know-i what crowds Ran
Jose can attract to a race meet
The programme of events and prizes is
as follows:
One mile open (professional)â sso, $25, $15.
Two-tnirds of a mile handicap (protes
sional)â)Ho, $20, $10.
Oof-thirdoi a. mile scratch (amateur)â s2s,
$15, $7 50.
One mile handicap (amateur)â s2s, $15,
$7 50.
Entries close with J. A. Desimone. sec
retary race-meet committee, Sunday,
May 23.
The day following the San Jose meet
(Monday, May 31. which is Decoration
day and a iegal holiday) the Ariel Bicycle
Ciub will hold races on its new track at
Vallejo, a description of which was given
in The Call last .Monday. Tiie events
and prizes are:
Two-thirds of a mile scratch (professional)â
$30, $15, $7 50.
One mile handicap (professional)â s3o, $15,
$7 50.
Haif mile scratch (amateur)â s2o, $10, $5.
Five miles, club championship (A, B, 0)â
Blue ribbon.
The entries for this meet will close Mon
day, May 24. Oi course both of these
meets are under sanction from the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs, as an L.
A. W. sanction would not be worth the
paper it was written on in this part of the
State now.
The Olympic Cltsb Wheelmen will hold
a bis road race Sunday, May 23.
To-morrow is the day set for the great
est outing that the Bay City Wheelmen
take. It is the fourth annual Wetmore
run to Blithedale, so called because once
a year ex-President Wetmore invites ail
the members, ex-members and friends of
the club to join in a short ride to this pop
ular Marin County summering plÂ«ce,
where outdoor games form the chief di
vertissment, and where the table rivals
the lestal boards of Centerville, long
jamrfi for excellence among wheelmen.
'Ihe Wetruore run is an invitational affair,
and up to yesterday noon seventy- seven
acceptances had been received, principally
from ex-inemhers and quests. When this
number is swelled by a large proportion of
the ciub's present membership of 157
there will be an imruen-e gathering of
wheelmen, und a joyous time is antici
pated.
The programme is to take the 10 a. m.
Sausalito boat. From Sausalito the dis
tance by wtieel is only six miles. Thoie
â without wheels will take tbe train to Mill
Valley.
The postponed run of the Cams a Club
Cyclnts to Vilia de COlllO, near ban Ausei
me, will be held to-morrow. Captain Ar
gen.i's orders are to take the 9 a. m. Sausa
lito boat and train to Corte Madera, riding
awheel from that point.
A race meet was to be held at Healds
burg to-day, the star attractions being
Coulter and Jones, tbe well-known pro
fessional riders, but this meet has been
called off and instead one will be held at
Santa Rosa to-morrow.
J. E. Alexander, at one time a member
of the Garden City Cyclers' racing team,
and Miss Wanda Miller, will be married
in San Jose on May 20. R. R. Kuss, ex
captain of the Olympic Cluo Wheelmen,
and Miss Charlotte Â£. Brosius, will a. so
be married in the Garden City, the date
set bein-: June 14. Cycling and matri
mony seem to co well together. Here we
nave hud Ravlin, Foster, Argenti and
Brunt and now Alexander and Russ.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
have decided to issue a new roadbook of
this State at once, which will be far more
complete and valuable than any hereto
fore printed. The entire roadbook com
mittee recently appointed by President
Swain, consisting of Messrs. Welch, Ker
rigan, Wynne, Stratton, Adams and A.
6. McFarland, will mset to-night at Sec
retary Scovern's house, and as all the
necessary data has already been gathered
It will not take long to get it in snape.
The Alameda Cycler-, having been
burned out last Sunday night, have se
cured temporary quarters on Santa Clara
avenue, near Park street, and will give a
benefit performance on Thursday even
ing, May 27. to raise funds to refurnish
their quarters.
The California Cycling Club has issued
invitations for a social hop to be held on
Wednesday evening, May 26, at Hinman's
Hall, Howard and Twenty-first streets.
Its dancing parties are always very select
and thoroughly enjoyable.
The postponed high jinks and smoker
of the San Francisco Road Club will be
held on Thursday evening, the 20th inst.
The racing committee have decided to
bold a five-mile handicap road race for
club members on Sunday, the 20th of June,

The racing rules of the California Associated
Cycling clubs for both road and track are
ready tor delivery nnd may be had on apu.ica
tion to any membei;of either the Road or Track
Racing Committee.
The track racing rules differ in few respects
from those heretofore in use. The arbitrary
attempt of the League of American Wheelmen
to divide California inio two Siates and to de
| Clare that amateurs from the southern part of
i the State shall not travel beyond a fixed dis-
I tance from their homes to compete with ama
teurs in the northern part ot the State is Ig
nored. Henceforth amateurs are free to com
pete at any distance from their homes within
the State. To this extent California is re
united.
The attention of referees and race promoters
Is called to changes in track rules as follows:
1. Relating to duties of starter. The rule as
to recall in case of a fall at the start is amended
I to read as follows:
j "In case of a fall within thirty feet of the
! scratch line the contestants shall be recalled
i by the starter and the race started over again,
but this shall not apply to the iall of a con
testant caused by the breaking of his own
wheel, if no other contestant is thrown there
j by. In the event of the breaking ot a contest
ant's wheel at the start there snail be no de
lay to permit him to repair the injury or ob
tain another wheel, but if there is any subse
quent trial hea* of the same event the reieree
' may peimit him to ride therein."
2. Relating to trial heal--â ln all trial heats
for scraich races a pHce.'iaker or pacemakers
! may be designated by the referee, who Rhall
i start from scraich, at the pole, and the pace
maker or pacemakers sha.l qualify for the
final provided they finish over the tape.
Thee pacemakers shall not be aJjudged dis
tanced. When there are more than two heats
none in the slowest heat shall qualify for the
final and the elimination of the slowest, heat
j may also be applied by the referee to the trial
j heats of a scratch event wherein pacemakers
have not been designated. R. M. Welch,
Chairman Track Racing Committee, C. A. C. C.
Captain Robbins has called a run of the
California Cycling Club for to-morrow to
Menlo Park, to join the Menlo Road Club
on its Dicnic run. John Burkeand Henry
I Wynne will have a match race on this oc
[ casion.
The racing board of the Associated
CluDs desires to deny the statement in a
morning paper that pool-selling will bt
permitted at the meet to be held at Val
lejo on May 31 or at any meet un^er the
association's sanction. The sanction of
any club that permits pool-selling in con
nection with a meet it may bold will be at
once revoked and future sanctions denied
the club.
The next meeting of the board of gov
ernors of the association will be held
Saturday evening, June 5, at Sacramento,
the bonrd beini: me guests of the Capital
City Wheelmen. The next day the club
will hold a big meet there on its new
three-lap track. Arrangements are being
made here for a special car to leave here
Saturday afternoon, conveying the board
oi governors to its meeting and such
racing men as will go vi â officials, train
j ers, clubmen, etc. As the number who
I are going must De known soon, applica
' tion3 for passaee on this car should be

ready signified their intention of making
the trip. Spaldinq.
ATHLETIC.
A California Amateur Athletic As-
soclation Will Be Formed
This Month.
The officers of the Olympic Club have
called a meeting of amateur athletes for
the evening of the 28th inst., for the pur
pose of organizing a purely California
amateur athletic association. The leader
of the club, Howard Patrick Taylor, has
sent invitations to the Academic Athletic
League, the Acme Club, Fresno Athletic
CluD, Stauford University, Reliance Cub.
Sacramento Athletic Club, St. Mary's Col
lege, Stockton Athletic As-ociation, Los
Angeles Athletic Club, Y. M. C. A. of this
City and Oakland and the University of
California, asking them to send represen
tatives to the meeting.
Athietics at the Young Men's Christian
Association are at present in a state of
chaof, and it is booed that too trouble be
tween the athletes and the officers of the
association will, in a short time, come to
a proper head as they were about a couple
of months aco.
Last week about twenty-five of the
athletes of the Young Men's Christian
Association organized, independent of the
association, a club which was named the
Union Athletic Club, for the purpose of
holding on Sundays cross-country runs,
bicycle runs, field days, baseball, and
other pastimes which they feel, as do
many others, tbat, if they had in this
City half-holidays on Saturdays as in the
East, the athletes would lessen their de
sire to find the different sports they now
look for on Sundays.
The officers of the club are: Fred L.
Stiaw, president; H, C. Guittard, vice
president; George Klarmann, captain;
W. W. Harder, secretary and treasurer;
and L. Jennin . s, first lieutenant.
The general secretary of the Y. M. C. A.,
Henry J. McCoy, upon hearing of the
organization of said athletic club and of
the club's meeting-place being one of the
association's rooms, immediately opposed
the actions of the athletes and also gave
directions disallowing them to have their
plans carried out under the auspices of
the association, as he thought it would be
Against the workings of the association.
He also hopes that the athletic club be
not allowed to exist, as he thinks it
against the rules of the association.
As for the athletes themselves who have
joined the club, they do not in any way
whatsoever wish to antagonize the Young
Men'? Chilstian Association, but are quite
put out by the way they have been treated
by the general secretary and other officers,
as they say they are not at all detrimental
10 the Young Men's Christian Association
in any way. but are a special, independent
organization in themselves, although at
the same time being members and work
ing for the welfare of tbe association.
THE PUGILISTS.
Tha Olympic Club Fistic Carnival.
Record of Charley Mc-
Kaever.
The directors of the Olympic Club are
expecting a large crowd at Woodward's
Pavilion un the evening of their fistic en
tertainment, and doubtless they will not
be disappointed, as the card is a good one.
Professor Miehling, the wrestling in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 15, 1897.
structor, who has been looking after
Leonard and Baker for the past few
weeks, states that the pugilists are in
good condition and will surprise the
knowing ones who are playing Jeffries
and Gans. The last-named pugilists are
strong favorites, and it is thought that on
the evening of the mills Jeffries will sell
at $10 as against $4 on Baker, and that the
hackers of Gans will have to Rive very
long odds. What betting has been done
so far was $10 to $3, with the Baltimore lad
i n the long end.
The National Club has not as yet de
cided which evening this month it will
give the sporting public an opportunity
of seeing George Green and Charley Me-
Keever in battle. The directors have been
tieuring on the evening of the 26th in*t.,
but as the California Club people have ae
cided to held their show on the evening
of the 31st inst. doubtless the Nationals
will postpone their carnival until some
day in the early part of June.
McKeever will be many pounds lighter
than Green when the pair will meet in
the ring. They have signed to right at
catch-weights and that will mean that
McKeever will weigh about 138 pounds
and Green 148 pounds. The Eastern man
does not seem to care very much about
the handicap. He says that almost every
right he has had he gave his opponent a
handicap in weight. McKeever must be a
great fighter if record speaks the truth.
Here it is :
Beat George Dixon in four rounds, Owen
Ziegler in four, fctanton Abbott in six, Jack
Everhart in six, Jack rianley in two, An<iy
Watson In three, Jimmy Mitchell in three,
Jimmy Fox in four, Billie Young in eighteen,

ANGLING.
San Andreas Lake Will Ba Open to
Fishermen on June 1.
The Spring Valley Water Company has
at last concluded to give anglers an op
portunity of cleaning out some Of tbe
wormy fines of Lake San Andreas a
month earlier than the directors proposed.
At a meeting held last week Messrs.
Howard, Borrell and Kin?, who, it ap
pears, have the powar to issue or refuse
anglers permission to wet their lines on the
preserved waters of the company, decided
to open the lake in question to "the
gentle artists" until July L but when they
discovered that the trout of San Andreas
Lake are in a most sickening condition
this year, the "experts on fishes" altered
their intentions and concluded, and
wisely, too, that they would issue permits
to anglers on June 1.
It can be said without fear of contradic
tion that there will be a rush of trout
fishermen to the lake on the first Sunday
in June, and il.cn the lovers of good
things eatable will have an opportunity
of tasting tbe flavor of trout parasites
which some of the connoisseurs contend
are of as good flavor as the stall fed
ground worms which are prized so highly
by the epicures of France.
The Crystal Spring Lake, wb/ch con
tains thousands of bass and trout, will
not be opened to anglers this year, and
doubtless it will be closed to the fra
ternity for all time.
Mos-rs. Walker and Cooper returned
from Wrights station last Sunday with
nice messes of trout and excellent apye
tites.
James Watt states positively that bo
saw a beautiful mermaid last Sunday
while fishing the San Pablo Creefc and
tbat it disappeaied the instaat it caught
sight of hie specs. But Mr. Watt contends
that it was a beautiful maid, nevertheless.
Frank Dolliver states tbat be bas a
leather spinner which will attract fi<h
when all spoons fail. He has applied for a
patent.
John Gallaeber, the champion trout
catcher of Oakland, will soon taite his de
parture for the mountains, where good
sport is always sure to be had during the
summer.
THE OARSMEN.
The South Ends and Other Crews
Training for the Coming:
Regatta.
At the last regular meeting of the South
End Rowing Club it was decided to post
pone the club reealti until Sunday, May
30, at 11 a. m. By that time it is hoped
that ali tue crews will be in racing con
dition and no trouble will be encountered
in selecting material for the big El Campo
regatta to take place on Sunday, June 20.
A committee of three, consisting of
Joseph Lyons, Matt Breen and T. I. Fitz
patrick, were appointed for the purpose
of making arrnngeiuents and matching
crews for the club regatta.
Joe Lyons and his junior crew were out
again last Sunday morning and rowed to
the Dolphins and return without a stop.
If these gentlemen keep on with their
good work it is more than likely that
they will be heard from in the big regatta.
The crew consists of the following: Joe
Lyons, stroke; Alex McGeorge, after
waist; Will Fox, forward waist, and
Frank Tobin, bow.
Another crew equally as good as the
above mentioned, consisting of Frank
Burke, stroke; James Feehan, after waist;
Will McHer.n, forward waist, ana Will
Mead, bow, was also out last Sunday and
rowed a strong and steady stroke over the
three-mile course.
Jim Foley and Bob McArthur will com
pete in the junior shell race. McArthur
will row McCausland's old shell. Foley
has been making extensive repairs on
the old shell which tie purchased from
Growney, and says he will surprise tbe
natives when the word to start is given.
henry Bode is in training for the junior
skiff race, and may be seen almust every
evening, together with Dr. Dennis, count
ing the number of strokes between Long
bridge and the sugar wharf.
The new senior crew is now in excellent
form and waiting patiently for the 30th to
arrive, when they expect to lower the col
ors ot the Midgets.
Some time ngo Manager Fo'.ey of the
South End baseball team sent a challenge
to the ball team of the Pioneer Rowing
Club and, sad to say, the challenge was
not accepted, as the Pioneers did not be
lieve in breaking the Sabbath by playing
baseball. The South Enda contend that
cold feet was the true reason.
Fred Webster, the well-known Olympic
Club wrestler, has applied for membership
to the South End Rowing Club and will
be admitted at the next meeting.

VOLLEY BALL.
A New Game Which Is Now Played
at the Y. M. C. Association
Bulldlne.
A new game called volley ball was
played for ih â  first time on the Pacific
Coast last Tuesday evening at the gymna
sium of the Y. M. C. A. "Volley ball" is
the invention of Mr. Morgan of Holyoke,
Mass., who his been instructor in gym
nasiics and athletics for a number of years.
Volley ball has the following advan
tages over basket-ball, handball and lawn
tennis: It is not so rough as basket-bail,
accidents are almost impossible; it is not
liable to be so one-sided as handball and
tennis usually are for the average player
and 'he expenses for court and outrit are
Tory small.
The game is fully described in the "As
sociation Athletic Handbook for 1897,"
where also the rules are given in detail.
The game played Tuesday evening was a
practice game between two teams from
the Mission Youi>g Men's Christian Asso
ciation and from the German Branch Y.
M. C. A. Four men played on a side with
the following line-up:
Mission teamâ Lamont, Tayler, Smith,
Sankey, McCloud.
German team â Herrings, J. Tonjes,
Homer, H. Tonjes.
The score of tne volley ball game stood
40 to 31 points in favor of the Mission
team. J. <J. Daub acted as referee.
The cy m na.-ium floor is divided into two
courts by a net suspended from two posts
about six feet from the ground. The net
is aoout twenty-live feet long. The play
ers are placed on each side ot the net, and
their number can be from two to twelve
on each side, according to the size of the
playground. Each side plays nine in
nings in a regular game. The game is
started by one player of a side oatting the
ball from a position having one foot on
the back line over the net into the op
ponent's court.
Two trials are allowed for each service.
Should the server fail to bat the bail over
the net in the two trials, then another
player of that side ha> to serve or bat the
ball over the net. When the ball goes
over the net the opposite side has to re
turn it before the ball touches the ground.
So it is butted back nnd forth until v
strikes the floor or Ik batted out of bounds.
Failure to return the ball according to
rules counts one point for the opposite
side.
Tiiis game is recommended by the
physical direc ors' conference, which was
nelii in Springfield, Mass., last year.
Tlio first cxmbition game of vol.ey ball
is to tuke place ou Tnursday evening,
May 27, at the gymnasium of the Young
Men's Ch-iÂ»tian Association of this City.
On the same â¢veiling and at the same
place the San Francisco Business Men's
team will play their last -amo in the
present basket-bail tournament.
Basket Ball.
The last game played between the Cy
clones and the Athens from Oakland was
the snrprisa of the season.
The Athens were considered Oakland's
best learn. They were second only to the
Business Men of San Francisco, but now
the Cyclones have beaten them by a score
of Bto 4 Captain Keir and Left Forward
Lausteu of the Cyclones were too quick
for the Athenians and outplayed them
quite easily. The Athens missed many
good chances at goal-throwing.
The game played last night between
the Rushers and the Ninety-sevens was a
fine exhiDition of the bnsket-ball game.
The team work of the Rushers was very
creditable. Their men had a great ad
vantage over the Ninety-sevens in their
â  z<- and strength. They did not have so
many chances at the goal, but their
chances were well improved by Nunan,
Spacher, Simpson and Captain Shaw.
Little Key and Captain Townsend showed
up well for their side. The score was 12
to 4 in favor of the Rushers.
The tournament will soon come to its
close. Should the Business Men's team
win the championship, it might be pos
sible for them to spend their summer
vacation on a trip south, playing the
basket-ball teams of the different towns.

GEOEZINGEE ACCUSED.
Charges of Irregularities in Office
Weru Filed Yesterday.
Serious accusations were made by the
Pacific Sash-Weight and Foundry Com
pany against Justice of the Peace G. C.
Groezinger yesterday in a petition pre
sented to the Superior Court, asking for
a review of one of the Justice's decisions.
J. J. Kauer sued the Sash Company
and obtained judgment on the 6th of
April. The affidavit of the manager of
the company alleges that Justice Groez
inger has made a false record of the pro
ceedings, that as a matter of fact he did
not bold court on the time he sa^s he did,
that he did not examine John Dale as a
witness, and did not try (he case us his
books certify.
It ia aiso charged that Justice Groez
inger permitted Attorney Georaie H.
Perry, who represented Raur, to take
possession of the papers in the casa and
to retain them at a time wheu they ought
to have been on tile in the clerk's office,
in order to deprive the company aud its
agents from having access to the public
documents as provided by law.

This will not prevent a trial, however, as the
accusation will ba brought belore another
Grand Jury.

If you only knew the wonderful record this famous Belt has madeâ how numerous are the
grateful letters Dr. Sanden has receivedâ you would not hesitate, ana why should yon

here; but this is a sample, dated April 25:
'â I have worn your Electric Belt two months now, and can say that I am a better and
'stronger man than ever. I feel no weakness in my back and no more waste of strength," from
I* walker, Beckwith, Cal. ' ' '.-.- v ;...;--â¢ -'. .â¢ -.' - ..â â¢â â .â -.
' Dr. Sanden has all the confidence in his treatment that a scientist can hiive in the method
I; which has done so much for humanity. His success is owing to his special study of the
treatment and his close attention to patients \ under his care. He ' gives personal advice in
every case, and does not permit traveling agents nor drugstores to sell 1 his Belts. His book,
"Three Uns se s of Men," is free. It is full of grateful letters. Every man should read it.

ORIENTAL TOURISTS.
K. Sumitomo, the Mcheat Citizen or
Japiio, "ii Hi* Travelsâ American
Railroad Courtesle*.
Tbe number of Japanese, Chinese and
Hawaiians that have passed througn Ban
Francisco recently en route to London in
dicates that the Queen's Jubilee wili beat
tended by many represeniatiTes from the
Orient and the" isles of tbe Pacific. The
Japanese are becoming great travelers.
The richest man in Jacan, K. Sumitomo
o' Tokio, whose wealth is estimated at
$6,000,000, passed throutrh here on his way
East a few days aeo. His wife is closely
related to the Crown Prince of Japan, and
his brother is the Minister Plenipotentiary
from Japan to France.
Yesterday Geoye Hirata of Tokio, Sumi
tomo's lawyer, left here to overtake bis
rich client. A notary, T. Murmatsu of
Osafca; M. Henrost, capitalist and ad
vser, >na S. Yosnido, interpreter, travel
with Mr. Sumitomo.
As an I. lustration of what a civilized
railroad compauy can do to advance the
interests of a country, it may be noted
that representatives ot the Pennsylvania
line met the Japanese tourists at San
Frar.osco, Chicago, Altoona and Pitta
burp. William Be Dell, the Pennsylvania
agent in San Francisco, and his assistant,
J. Clerfayt, who speaks the Japanese lan
guage, greet Oriental travelers on their
arrival herp, and telegraph ahead tv tbe
Pennsylvania people in Chicago.
Coorteaies g* Uus character were ex
tended to K. Yukawa, delegate from Japan
to the Postal Congress in Washington ;
R. Avai, secretary of tbe postal telegraph
of Japan, and J. Y. Mori, vice-president
of the Nippon Kail way Company. It
transpires that Mi. Mori since ne left San
Francisco jrave un order for eighteen
American locomotives lot bis railroad in
Japan. He vifcited the Company's shops
at Altoona, the largest railroad shops in
the world, and was deeply interested in
the school for tne education of train en
gineers.
PAGE'S NEXT TBIAL.
Judge Wallace Will Next Friday Set
Ills Date of Hearing.
James D. Page, who was once convicted of
the crime cf embezzlement and was sentenced
to the Sfate prison, appeared in Judge Wal
lace's court yes'erday morning to arrange for
the new trial which was granted him by the
Supreme Court.
Mr. Page's case has aroused considerable in
terest among lawyers and others because of
the peculiar grounds on which the new trial
was granted.
It was proved at the trial that while Page
was District Attorney of San Francisco ho
came into the possession of several thousand
dollars belonging to an insane persou and that
he never t.uid the money back and never In
any way accounted for its disappearance; out
on ttie contrary, when eitea by the Probate
Court to show what had become of lhefuuds
intrusted to him iie ran away to New York, as
sumed a faise nnme, was subsequently ar
rested, and a trial being had he was convicted.
Notwithstanding Â«11 these facts the Supreme
Court granted Page a new trial because there
was noihiug in thfe record to sht.w that a de
mo nd had ever been made for a return of the
trust funds.
On this point a motion for dismissal of the
indictment wns made '>y Pass's attorney, but
Judge Wallace refused io Â«ran>. this motion,
saying thai he could not foresee what would
be proved at the next trial; possibly the pros
ecution might then establish that'ademand
had been made for a return of the money; or
even now a demand may be made before the
next trial berlns.
It was finally agreed that the case shall be
cabled on the Slat inst., at which time it is
expected that the date of the next trial shah
be set.

BRICE THINKS HE
WILL HOLD IT DOWN
Will Build a Big Hatchery
This Year Back of
Tomales.
Has Come From Washington to
Buy the Hatchery on
Battle Creek.
He Says He His Materially Reduced
Expensesâ California's Entire
Delegation for Him.
J. J. Brlce, United States Fish Commis
sioner, Washington, D. C, was at the
Palace yesterday. He has bean in Cali
fornia two weeks, and has been examining
into the fish interests and laying plans
for the year. Mr. Brice thinks he will
continue to be the General Fish Commis
sioner, notwithstanding tte efforts of
Senator Eikins to have a man appointed
Jrom the iLenawba and of Maine men
to have a man appointed from the Fine
Treo State.
"The Fish Commissioners hitherto have j
held the place for life," said he. "It has
never been regardei as a political posi
tion. Party has had nothing to do with
it. Bayard, the fir=t Commissioner, held
the placa during his life, and so did Me- i
Donald, who succeeded him. I never ex
pected any opposiiion, and when it came
recently I was surprised. But I do not
think it trill avail anything. The entire
California delegation is for me. It won't
split ud on party lines.
"Last year 400 per cent more work was
done at 20 per cen i le?s cost than in any
year before in the interest of tish. U'ider
ihe other system from $1 to $1 85 a thou
sand was paid for salmon egg?. We paid
for them 11 cents a thousand, and all
along me line reductions have been pretty
much the same â not so much in some in
stances, but there has been a general les
sening of expenses every way. The in
crease of output and decrease of price have
been very apparent.
"In view of the increase of work and the
economy of it it is presumed they will
hardly put me out.
'I came out this time to attend to the
buying of the California Slate Hatchery in
Battle Creek. It will be purchased at the
cost price. We hav3 sine? I became Com
missioner built three auxiliary hatcheries
on tUe Columbia and one on the Sacra
mento, besides leasing hitherto the Cali
fornia State Hatchery oefore alluded to.
"We i<ave in contemplation now a very
large hatchery, near San Francisco, that
will be of great importance to this City
I and California. It will be located back of
Tomales, in the vicinity of the Russian
River. We want a place where eggs can
he brought and hatched, and where Ihe
fry can be put in the lresu water streams
about, and gradually work down 10 the
bay. In this way the destruction of the
young li:h will be avoided. Tne hatchery
will cost about $15,000."
Commissioner Brice has had the full
confidence of both the Senate and House
comeliness on appropriations, and it is
understood th6y will stand by the Com
missioner in lurther proposed appropria
tions. Mr. Brice left on his return to
Washington last niuht.
Philip Kohrbacher'g Will.
The will of the late Philip Rohrbacher has
been tiled for probate. The estate consists of
lnnd and improvements at 310 Fulton street
worth $12,000. One-hn.lf is bequeathed to the
widow and the remainder is to be distributed
among tne children of the testator.
FELL TO THE FLOOR.
HIS LEGS SUDDENLY GAVE OUT.
Thomas P. Bigg of Cleveland Stricken
as He Wat Preparing lor a Visit
to Friends.
From the Leader, Cleveland, Ohio.
Of the list of the many so-called incurable
disorders none has proved to be more of an
enigma to the most learned and accomplished
physicians than locomotor ataxia, or as it is
more commonly known, creeping paralysis.
This dread disease has battled their skill, and
they have be;u forced to admit 'that they :
cannot successfully cope with it. All they
have been able to do is to mitigate the accom
panying pain and suffering; beyond this the
science of medicine has been of little or no
avail to the many unfortunates who nave con
tracted the dreadful malady, which many ]
people, especially those who are thus afflicted, ,
believe is a forerunner of the grim messenger j
of death. -
Thomas P. Bigg, who lives at 1073 St. Clair !
street, corner of Lawrence, Cleveland, Ohio, :
has been suffering from locomotor ataxia for
nearly live years, and nothing but hit) wonder- ,
ful vitality has prevented his dissolution long :
before this.
The malady Is directly attributable to his !
exposure during army life. He enlisted in the
Third Regiment, Ohio Cavalry, in Toledo, and '
served nineteen months in the volunteer ser- ' .
vice, and after the close of me Rebellion, !
eighteen moutns in the regular army. "At i
first,", he said, in narrating his experience, .
"my stomach went back on me, and for six â -.
weeks 1 was laid up in a hospital in Texas.
Ever since that time that organ his caus.-d me
trouble, and about seven years ago ihe doctor j
told me I was suffering from acute indigestion. |
That was bad enough, but four years ago last
July paralysis came on, and 1" have been
using these crutches over since. The paralysis
was in my legs, and it came rather suddenly.
I noticed at first that my knees were a little
stiffâ * sort of rheumatic pain, you know. This
quietly developed into paralysis. . - :
"1 tried all kinds of remedies, and I tried
physicians, but I. div not improve. All this
time, though, 1 was ho:ding my ownâ wasn't j
getting any worse. A short time aeo I was in
duced to try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. I did
not expect this last venture would prove auy
more ueneficial- than the others which pre
ceded it ; but I am pleased to s*y I was most
agreeably disappointed. Dr. Williams', Pink
Pills aro simply.. wonderful. I began to use;
them two mouths ago. M v legs then were per- '
fectly numb and â nothing could warm
them. After suffering with paralysis tor more
than four years, I now experience a comfort- i
ing feeling of warmth in my lower limbs. XI
ton you 1 feel like shouting when I think of
escaping from my bondage, and my mind is
on tue subject pretty much of the time. I In
tend ;o continue the use of the pills until my
Ics are as good and useful as they were in
their best days, and I feel that will be soon."
"What effect have the pills had upon your
stomach? ' Mr. Bigg was asked. "As â¢ regards â 
that," Â»aid he, "yuu can readily bslieve mat a
stomach which has been seriously out of order
for thirty-five years is in bad shape. Nothing
used to stay on my stomach, and I was subject
to violeut flu of hiccoughing. Then I would
have to take an opiate to get to : sleep. But
now I find that food stays or. my stomaen,
though 1 do not suppose that organ 7 will ever
be in ur-i-clais shape again. Still I am satis
lied to think that it has improved to such a
degree, and that I can eat with a feeling of
ease." '' - " â¢â 'â¢â  â  â ' â â '- ' â¢ '' â¢/â¢ â  â  ' :
For Â«ix years until a month ago, October,
1896, Mr. Bigg kept'a stationery and confec
tionery store iat 347 East i Madison avenue,
directly opposite toe M*iisou-avenue School.
He sold out bis business and can now be lound
at any time at 1073 St. ("lair street.

THE LOCAL HIDE MARKET.
The circnlar of the sumuer Tannin? Company
says: "There seems to be a downward tendency
in the hide market,
â¢â¢The tariff question now before Coneress ap
pears to have unsettled hide and leather values,
and purchasers are awaiting for the result of the
tariff legislation.
â¢â¢General business has been about the same dur
ing the past mon h. but purchases have been made
only for gooJs absolu ely necessary.
"Wet >. 1 . '1 hides remain aboutthesame. Stocks
seem to be accumulating and prices are perhaps a
trine weak. "' 'â 
â¢The dr â¢ hide market is weaker. Nearly all the
dry bides of California are shipped to the East,
very few being tanned in this market, and there
fore prices are. based on the values obtainable in
New York and Boston.
"Shipments are made on very small margins, ana
the prices paid in San Francisco are made on the
l.gures obtainable East.
â¢â¢Dry hides show a decline during the past
mom I*l of about I^o to s'Â±~. in tbe Eastern market.
â¢'Dry kips are' null and rule at about 2c less
.tban dry hides.
â¢â¢HoisehiJesare hi a standstill, and the values
On these goods are based on the price paid for the
lighter grade No. 2wi salted hides.
! -Wool Â«nil sheepskins are much weaker. In
March and April there waÂ« a stiODg speculative
demand for wool, caused by the prospective t v in*.
There has been a reaction, ai;d prices have de- !
clined. Ihe prices which have been p. ii during
the past 11 cur two months for noil throughout
the country cannot now be sustained.
â¢Tallow is quiet and rules at low figures.
"Deerskin trade continues nominal, and the
trade In iheao skins is confitud to stock which
comes from, adjoining States and foreig.i countries.
Dterskln values are based on the snor. -hair for
eign skins, which can be bought in the Eastern
mArket at rorupmatively low figures. T:ie sum
mer and short-haired skins aredealrable and bring
cood prices, but the thin, papery and winter skins
ate very dull at low figures.
â¢â¢The prospect for hides and leather Is not espe
cially encouraging, and we do not look for any ac
tivity In busiÃrsi until the tariff legislation is set
tled."

anil low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alonÂ»r the coast, raiu is probable:
but when the "low is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer

XtW YORK MARKETS.
X*EW YORK. N. V.. May 14.â stock mar
ket was depressed by the revival at Wasnlngtou
of interest in the Cubsn situation. The possi
bility that the efforts of the administration to pro
tect and succor American citizens in Cuba mi
result iv stiained relations with .-rpaiu was made
1 much of and the views entertained not only
caused selling for both account*, but also 1 ended j
to curtail trading. The greatest Â»ct vity was Ui
sugar Keflning. The market lor it was heavy
throughout. The only slocks moving contrary to
the trend of the market were Manhattan Hallway,
Western Union, Union Pacific ana a few inactive
shares. A less bearish leering exists regarding
Western Union because of the cumulative evi
dence that the amicable relations between the
company and Bell Telephone are not likely to be
disturbed by the Supreme Court decision in the
Berliner case this week. The closing stock mar
ket was featureless at a recovery of iy^ya per

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MARKET.
The following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by E. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker,' 412 . Fine street.
San Fbancisco, May 14, 1897.
Chicago.
Wheat bulls were surp-Ised this morning to find
Liverpool cables only i,id higher in the face of
yesterday's advance on this side. Opening quota
tions floe ted the weakness of traders who went
home long over night. July showed a shrinkage
of 34 to lc at the start. Good buying at the de
cline stiffened price* %c to %c
second cables, both private and , public, were
further depressed. This started local longs to un
loading; their efforts started St. Louis to join the
selling movement. Offerings grew Into large pro
portion more than the market was able to hold up
under, result being a break of 1 ',;'â  from the tqp.
July declined to 728,4 c May to 74V4C as against
76.- for the latter early in the day. At the decline
Cudahy's brokers bought freely; their buying
stopped the break and changed sentiment to some
extent. Many attribute to-day's decline to an
effort upon the part of prominent lougs to depress
the market in order to buy wheat on.
Outside news, except from Cal.iornia, was bull
ish. , New York reported yesterday's cable offer
ing! accepted. 200,000 bushels of wheat sold here
to-day : or export at an advance of 3c over May
quotations, spot wheat is closely held and de
mands a lair premium over market quotations.
The action in May w neat to-day set man/ to be
lieving a squeeze is not impossible. Mar i* heav
ily oversolu Much of the short sales are under
70c he difference between May and July at one
time during the session was 'Z\ f %c in favor of May.
Estimates on Monday's visible supply ranee
from l,5(:0,00u to 2,000,000 decrease.

were conspicuous by their absence.
Sail Francisco.
9:15 a. M. skssion.
A weeker feeling In wheat was displayed at the
opening. Disappointing cables and cloudy weather
kepi bull traders from taking held. Initial price
of December was $1 23s/ 8 against $1 28% at ttio
close yesterday. Trailing was of a limited charac
ter. Long* did not show any ills post! ion to be
come frightened, regarding a small leactlon as
due.
hit-ago advices were encouraging to the long
side, explaining the slump in their market as
coming irom sources who were breaking prices In
order to buy on. Ihe session closed with $1 -'3 bid
tor December. No hiug was dune in May wheat
or berley. v. .' i.'
10:15 a. m. session.
Continued weikne<s in lite Chicago market
made the temper of local traders inclined to bear
ishness. December wheat started at *1 'il 3 sold
at $1 -7 c $ and advanced to $1 28 on good baying,
$1 281/8 iÂ»eing bid at tbe close.
Locm operators are acting very cautiously. In
form*.ion regarding crop conditions as yet is not
of a character to justify a fair estimate.
The e very-day sliorl-jeller i . inclined to keep close
to shore, temporarily at least. he remarkable
strong undercurrent to wheat makes selling haz
ardous.
The advance has been a healthy on". Very lit
tle sensationalism haa aceompanieJ the rise.
11:15 a. it. session. ' ;
Trading In wheat at the opening was 3/gc higher
than the closing of the previous session. Selling
by scalpers to take profit supplied the demands of
buyers. December fluctuated between $1 283
and $1 28, closing at *1 28 Vi bid. with $1 281/4
biu directly after the close.
Clearing weather added to the stronger feeling
In wheat. B.iriey was in better d-mand. Decem
b r opened at 7514.-, sold at 75i/gc and closed at
7. r i3,' '-. Between sessions buyers were bidding
76V 3 C. v . . : V
2 P. M. SESSION.
The afternoon session opened with a stronger
feeling in wheat, Uecemoer was wanted at
$1 28%. against SI -8y the previous session.
Tritdiuir was restricted to the local crowd, Ship
pers' influence wa-> Ã¼bsert. The strong undertone
litre in wheat is. to say the least, remaricable.
Foreign and Knit m markets closed very weak.
while 1:1 this market wheat loses to-day only a
trifle lower than yes'.er.luy. The market is in a
good condition to advance sharply with any
further encouragement. There seems very little
resistance against an advance.

WOOLâ Jacob â Woliner's circular says: "Ours,
as well as 'in- Eastern market, can be quoted very
dull with no Inquiry for Wool at any price. Every-
Ing seems to oe at a si andsiill awaiting the pas
sage or the l' riff bill. Manufacturers are all over
stocked and it will be some time before there will ,
be a chance to rea izÂ« on Wool. The balance or
the Wool] in Rev' Bluff, which consisted of the >
three lamest clips, about 600 ba'es, was sold at j
lOVsC It looked very cheap, â  but that price can- j
not oe rea ized iodav. Wools still r.rrlve freely,
mostly on consignment, and the warehouses are
well led. Wools cannot be quoted lower, as there
Is no demand nor offer to buy at auy prices. All
Eastern advice* confirm this state of affairs: 'Mar
ket not lower, but no demand.' A lull in the mar
ket was expected on account of the tremendous
sales made in the last three months, but It came
two weeks sooner than it was expected; 100 soon
for the comfort of a sood many holders as well as
growers All b lycra havt withdrawn from the
Territories and uregou as well as in this State.

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been six arrivals from British
Columbia with 14, Â«587. tons of Coal, four from
Washington with 10,922 tons, three from Orevon
with 1550 tons and one from (Sydney with 1399
tons. Business generally in this line remains dv 1
ana shows very little vitality; the result is that
sorn* grades are belu? piled up in the yards, prin
cipally domestic CÂ»als. as the fair weather has
minimized their uses except for cooking purposes.
Prices show but little chance; Australian and
English are quoted a shade higher, caus d mainly
by Inward freiKbis being; advanced somewhat. Our
consumption of fuel this year will l>Â« less than in
189ti, as our factories are runntng light, although
our railroads and gut companies are consuming
their usual quota. The products of Corral Hollow
colliery are promises to be freely delivered here
In the near future, meanwhile it is being generally
tested to aster aiu for what purpose it will be
most effective as fuel. The tariff is yet In an em
bryonic or more properly characterized chaotic
condition: meanwhile all branches of commerce
are in a tou.plt-te mudd c awaiting thedisennn
glement of present complication*. As we are
promised beneficial change* from our Coast Coal
producers, we are only too willing to wait. We
shall not suffer for a scarcity of . foreign fuel this
year, us there Is at present sufficient tonnage en
gaged to Insure us shipments of 230,000 tons trom

TO WASHINGTON
Frank Leach's Return From
the East Has Great
Interest.
Expected to Have a Marked
Effect on Local Poli
tics.
The Mint Sup?rintnlency His B?en
Drawn Into thÂ° Local Scramble
for Place.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, May 14. (
Frank A. Leach, who was recommended
some months ago by the State delegation
for yuperituendent of tlie Mint, will re
turn from his Eastern trip in a few days,
and his home-comine is expected to have
a marked effect on local politics.
It is a long way from Washington to
the San Francisco Mint, and about as long
from Washington to the Oakland City
Hai!, but between all three places there
are very strong connections, and at this
time politicians in all of them are particu
larly I'usy in a common cause, though
witu different motives.
Mr. Leach for the past rive years has
been a powerful factor in Oakland politi
cal life. His strength was first seen with
the election of Dr. Pardee lor Mayor more
than four yeais ago. At that time Frank
L?acu championed the cause of ibe Muni
cipal League, and was generally consid
ered to be its author. Tne league cave to
Oak, and a non-partisan city government,
and for lour years it held sway. Its power
in the City Council and with ihe ex-City
Engineer, Wilson, was co great, that
Mayor Davie's official value as a political
element was entirely nullified.
The effect of the League was also felt in
National politics, and wilh the help of
11 r. Leach and his newspaper succeeded
in electing Mr. Hilborn to go to Congress
aeainst Judge Fr.cK, who was the candi
date of the old-line Republicans. Mr.
],each was also prominently identified
with the Friend Congressional commit
tee, which eventually succeeded in ob
taining recognition.
In tne last Senatorial campaign Mr.
Laach was a very earnest worker for Ssna
tor Perkins, and has been credited, rightly
or wrongly, wiih inducing Perkins to en
ter the Concessional tight on behalf of
Hilborn, in violation of a pledge that he
Wouid keep out.
The natural result of his efforts was the
support at Washington of Congressman
Hiiborn and Senator Perkins for Mr.
Leach for Superintendent of the Mint.
The news of this recommendation created
a sensation in this State, as it was not
known that Mr. L>ach was a candidate,
and he declared that the position was of
fered him unsolicited, and those who
know him best believe his statement to be
absolutely true.
Senator Deni?on was known to be a
candidate and bad so declared himself,
and he still has a host of friends who do
not despair of seeing him making Uncle
Sam's money for the next four years.
Denison, as all the West knows, has al
ways worked and spent bis money freely
in the cause of Republicanism, and they
b lieve that he should da recognized.
During Mr. Leach's absence several of
those who do not think Senator Deni?on
should be supplanted in the giving out of
Federal favors by Mr. Leach have been
carefully working in the interests of
their candidate.
Now comes the connection between the,
Federal office and City Hall politics.
Prior to the 3i of last November, there
were nightly meetings held on the City
Hali steps by the allied partiss, who
vainly attempted fusion in this county.
Th y declared, with unswerving confi
dence, that after ihe 31 of November the
old Republican party would be buried so
deep that its resurrection would be im
possible.
Somo of those men who upheld the
movement and who signified their ap
proval of it were Snenff White, Chief cf
Police Lloyd and the c;erk to the Chief ot
Police, Cuarles Gardiner, as well as John
Elley of the Street Department. With
Sheriff White the city government has
nothing to do. John Elley hau been sup
planted by the vice-president of a Repub
lican club, but the other officials, noted
Populists, are still in office. That changes
nave not been made is aue to the attitude
taken by City Attorney Dow, who with
Mayor Thomas forms the Republican ma
jority in the Board of Works. Two years
ago when the Populists partly gained con
trol of the bjard they made ail the
changes that tney poss:thy could in the
interests of their party, and the Repub
licans declared that if tne fusionists had
been successful at the last city election
they wou.d undoubtedly have substituted
a Populist for evory Republican in office,
and judging from experience this is un
doubtedly true.
The political element opposed to Mr.
Leach has somehow or other come to
believe tirrnly in tne opinion that City
Attorney Dow is absolutely controlled by
Mr. Leach and that he is merely holding
back till the arrival of the editor from the
But. It iÂ« not quite clear to outsiders
just why Mr. Leach should be credited
with being the dictator of Mr. Dow, but
the assumption is believed by many and
is being taken as the basis of a neat little
plan to destroy if possible Mr. Leach's
political prestige at Washington. After his
return if he does not prevail on Mr. Dow to
do nil he can with Mayor Thomas to assist
in putting the departments of (he city
covernment under the absolute control of
Republicans the point will be made that
he is not unswerving in his loyalty to the
varty mat elected McKiinev and of course
a'i these ideas will be duly forwarded to
Washington with the hope that Mr.
Leach will not be the next Superintendent
of the M :;t.
Mr. Lsach's friends are not, however,
allowing the fignt to be all on the one
side. They are tioing all in their power to
bring credit to the position he has taker,
throughout. They assert that it was an
absolute necessity for him or some one to
inaugurate a reform movement in the
city government four years ago, and that
bis course throughout has been consistent
and ttioroughly indorsed by the reforms
inaugurnted by the administration elected
by the Municipal League. They also refer
to the lact that in National poiit.es he has
always been strongly Republican from
first to la-i and an enthusiastic advocate
of the gold standard of currency, and that
under these circumstances local poiitic>
will not cut any figure in the distribution
of Federal patronage.
Under these circumstances it can readily
be -een that Mr. Leach's return is being
awaiied with marked interest by his po
etical friends and dissenter* alike.

TROUBLE IN A CHURCH
Berkeley Presbyterians Wran
gling Over Their Resigned
Pastor.
Resolutions of the Session Declared
to Be a Weak anl Insincere
State rr eat.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 14.â A state of
inbarmony appears to exist in the circles
of the First Presbyterian Church ns a re
sult of the forced resignation of Rev. Dr.
Ketcbum, the pastor.
A lew weeks ago be was asked by the
session to present bis resignation, which
he did peremptorily. It was to bave
taken effect according to the manner in
which it was made out, on June 1, but at
a recent meeting of tue congregation a
resolution was passed praising bis good
work and asking that be remain until
September 1. This he decided to do.
For several weeks the congregation has
awaited the issuance of resolutions from
the session expressing its state of feeling.
Yesterday tney appeared, sugar-coaied
and with graceful words of praise and
commendation for Dr. Ketchum in his six
years of pastoral worK in .Berkeley. Now
there has arisen frjm among the flock a
coterie ot dissenters who have in out
spoken terms by means of open letters
condemned the lesolutiuns of the session
as not being a sincere statement.
In an open letter to-night over the name
"Copeland" a member uas the following
to say:
The rather weak resolutions that were
spoken of had be?n prepared and were ready
to "fire" by the session who had proved them
selves so faithless to their pastor and the good
of the church, and alter the unchrisiian-iike
manner in which they had acted it did seem
rather hypocritical for them to bring forth
resolutions praising their pastor to Hie skies
when they had by their actions and words
worked against him* in every way, at the same
time Dretending to be his best friend.
We have seen it all even if it has been done in
sucn an underhanded wayâ as the worm gnaw
ing at the vitals. While we have been congrat
ulating ourselves upon the prosperity of our
church they have been constantly working to
drag down the walls, and when they utterly
ignored the young people and their resolu
tions I could not let such hypocrisy go un
checked.
Sabbath Observance.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 14.â The California
State Sabbath Association will hold its annual
convention this year in the First Congrega
tional Church In Oakland next MondÂ»y and
Tuesday. Tue opening session Jor puDlic ad
dresses will be Monday evening, at 7:45
o'clock. Tuesday there will be three sessions,
at all of which, except the forenoon, there
will be addresses by prominent speakers. As
the Christian Eadeavorers are tsking up Sab
bath observance as one of their lines of work,
it is probable that they will combine their
efforts with those of tue Sabbath Association.
WAS NEGLECTED FOR A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.
OAKLAND, Cal., slay 14.â The troubles of Mrs. Eva Mar Tenney, the well-known linger,
and her husband were partly toid in Judge Greene's court this morning in a complaint and
cross-complaint fcr a divorce. 11. O. Tenner stated thtt his wife lett her home without
provocation. Some time ago after the birth of a boy Mrs. Tenney temporarily lost her reason.
This was supcrinduc.-d by a car accident, in which she was injured. After being taken care
of a short time she was restored to capacity and completely cured. She is now keeping pro
fessional engagements as usual.
Mrs. Tenney told her own s'ory on the witness-stand. "We separated," she said, "became
I was extremely unhappy. Months before I left Mr. Tenney made friends with the telegraph
operator in Wells-Kargo's office, where he was employed. One time he brought her to our
house lor a week. I was compelled to cook and wait upon her and was neglected for her sake.
I told my husband he must choose between me and the baby and this girl. When I left him it
was agreed that I should live in San Francisco and he knew where I was to stay. During all
our married life he never bougiit me a single dress.' '
Tenney contradicted his wile in many of her statements. He declared ho had nothing to
do with the telegrapb-gir!, who was finally discharged at his wife's request. He gets a salary
of $70 a month.
Judge Greene asserted that the wife wai to blame for the household being broken up and
gave a decree of divorce to the husband on the ground of desertion. The custody of the child
will be decided in a few days.

Chief Officer Lawless of the Steam
ship Austra ia Is Proui of His
Partner in Life.
A LAMED A, Cal., May 14.â Robert T.
Lawless of this city had a remarkable ex
perience a few nights ago that ho will not
soon forget, nor wili his wife.
Lawlfss is the chief officer of the
Australia, of the Oceanic line, and he
i.yes when ashore with Mrs. Lawless in a
cozy residence at 1437 Fifth street.
Very often, when in port, Mr. Lawless is
compelled to stay on board the ship for a
night or two immediately after docking,
and before the last voyage of the steamer
Mrs. Lawless told him that she might go
to the City the night he arrived and re
main over with him.
Unexpectedly he was not obliged to
sleep is his stateroom on this stay in port,
and as Eoon a* everthing was shipshape
on the steamer he started for home.
it was quite late wLen be reached his
home and after rinsing the bell he con
cluded that his wife bad gone to the City
to see him, and sat down to await her
return when she found that he had gone
home. Two trains came and went, ami
still Mrs. Lawless did not appear, so the
master mariner concluded to make a
forcible entry into the house.
He went to the residence of a neighbor
and procured a lantern, aiter which he
made an investigation of the rear portion
of his home to see whether by chance any
windows through which he culd make
his way had been left open. A lower win
dow yielded and be cot into the lower por
tion of the bouse, but his further progress
was barred by a locked door leading to his
sleeping apartment.
There was nothing 1o do, if he was going
to get in, but to force it, and his muscular
shoulder soon had the door creaking. An
extra hard tush sent the obstacle flyinc
open with a brokpn lock, and then the
sailor retreated full speed before a start
line apparition.
There stood hid wife in her night clothes
j with a revolver clutched in her hand and
pointed at bis bead and a determined
gleam in her eye. Lawless ducked and
yelled at her not to shoot, and, lecocniz
ing his voice after a moment, she lowere i
| the weapon and allowed him to enter.
She explained that she and her niece
i had been sleeping in the bacK part of tho
I bouse and bad not heard the bell. She
, was awakened by hearing some one prowl
j ing about the house, and, gettine her
j trusty gun, prepared to repel boarder*.
She was just about to fire at one whom
she thought to be a burglar when she
i caught her husband's tones and released
her hold on the trigger.
Her niece's visit had prevented her from
making the trip to the City, and she had
no thought of her husband coming home,
as she bad supposed that be would remain
aboard the steamer until the next day.
Lawless is proud of his wife.
IMPALED ON A HARSOW.

Mishap at Hay ward*.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call. )
908 Broadway, May 14. )"
Joseph Wrede of Haywards met with
an accident thiÂ« morning that may
yet cost him his life, lie was struck on
the arm with a heavy sledgehammer, and
in falling impaled his head on a harrow in
his workshop.
Wrede and a companion were at work
this morning using heavy hammers on a
piece of hot metal. Both are experienced
workmen and have worked together for a
long time. In some manner or other
Wrede's companion struck a faulty blow
and hit Wrede on the arm. The dam ape
to the arm was not great, but the shock it
gave him caused him to swoon.
At the back of Wrede was a harrow that
had been brought into the shop, which is
owned by Chisbolm & Farrell, lor repairs,
and when Wrede fell one of the spikes
caught him on the top of the head. A
fearful wound was cut in hN scalo and it
was some time Defi>re ho recovered from
the double bl w. His injuries were at
tended to, bin there .s danger that the
wound on the head may produce con
ri'sMon of the brain, and consequently
Wiede is not yet considered to ba out of
dunger.
Wrede has been peculiarly unfortunate.
Nearly two years ato, when lightning was
conducted into t.'ie motor of the Hay
wards Electric Light Company, which
is owned by the same firm, Wrede was
standing by and received a powerful
shock. He was ?.:so somewhat cut by the
li.ing spiinters of the burst dynamo* and
bis escape from death was wonderful.
THE BOAT IS BEADY.
But the CommfÂ«Â«ion Men Are Not Yet
of One .Mind.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 14.â The pros
pect of the removal of the commission
men to the water front is not very bright
at present. There is a lack of harmony
among the dealers as to the scheme, and
much has yet to be arranged.
The steamer that is to "handle the com
mission business between Oakland and
Sacramento River points will leave As
toria to-night. The local dealers have met
with much opposition at every stage of
their progress from San Francisco dealers
who do not view with peasure the pros
pect of losing the commission business of
this city.
Water Company's War.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 14. -Next Thurs
day evening the two water companies
will appear Defore the Council and argue
the mauer of alternating tnr fire hydrants
throughout the city. The petition pre
sented by the Oakland Water Company at
last night's meeting looked something
like a directory of Oakland. It asked the
Council not to take any action that will
decrease the income of the Oakland Water
Company by talcing from them any of the
city patronage they now enjoy. This pe
tition was intended to offset that of the
Contra Costa Company for the alterna
tion of hydrants.

OAKLAND, Cal., May 14 J. O. Cla
ridge. a machinist, was fatally shot to
niÂ«ht at Elmhurst by P. D. McMann as
the result of endeavoring to reconcile the
latter to his wife.
The neighbors say that Mr. McMann
had been beating one of his children and
was quarreling with his wiie, who de
fended the little one. J. O. Claridge, an
elderly man living next door, tried to
reconcile husband and wife.
McMann seized a shotgun and turned
upon Claridge, who threw out his arm,
only to receive the full charge of the in
furiated man's weanon in the pit of the
stomach. 1 lie fingers of one hand were
also blown off.
Claridpe's wounds were pronouncbd
necessarily fatal.
McMann surrendered himself at the
Oakland police station at 11 o'clocu, two
hoxiTi after the shooting, and bevona
statins that he had shot a man in a quar
rel over a chil.i, refused to gire any ex-
Dlanation. McMann is 28 years of age.
THE BURNED OPERA-HOUSE.
Talk About Rebuildingâ Suspicion* Cir
cumstances Attending the Fire.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 14.â J. C. Linder
man, the owner of the opera-: o use which
was destroyed by fire last Bunday night,
returned from the mines yesterday after
noon. The first news he had on the fire
was on Wednesday, when he reached
Colfax and a friend showed him a City
paper containing an account of the diÂ«
aster.
He has not yet made up his mind what
to do with the property, but it is not re
garded likely that he will rebuild. It is
said that parties are negotiating for the
purchase of the property with the inten
tion of rebuilding. There is talk of bring
ing several organizations together under
one roof, but this has not yet taken
definite form. A San Francisco capitalist
is said to b* willing to put $40,000 Into
such a structure.
The investigation as to the cause of the
fire does not make much headway, thoueh
some facts have been unearthed which
look very strange. Soon after the tire
broke out it was noticed that the gas pipes
were disconnected from the meters, and
the gas was escaping with full force and
makine a great blaze. There was nothing
to indicate that the pipes had been
wrenched off by force, but on the contrary
thoÂ«e who saw them said that they looked
as if they had been disconnected by the
use of tools. There are said to be a couple
of people who noticed the odor of ' fire in
the afternoon, but their direct testimony
has not been' obtained as to this.
Early Closing.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 11â A move

that manner, and now the grocers propose
to imitate them. , A petition is in circula
tion and is being generally signed, plede
ing the signers to close .as soon after 6 p m.
as possible. Some favor (i:3O and others

REV. MR. WARREN
TO DHARMAPALA
An Answer to His Efforts
to Introduce Buddhism
Here.
His Comparison of the Indian
Creed and Chris
tianity.
He Wants the Hindoo Priests to
Leave Us in Our Own
Briefs.
Rev. J. B. Warren sends the following
letter anent the mission of Dharmapala to
this country :
In The Call recently appeared a lengthy
communication from H. Pnarmapala, general
secretary of the Maha-liodhi Society, in which
he expresses the desire nnd intention to estab
lish n branch of the society in the United
States. He tries to show that tnis wou.d be
an improvement on Christianity as now held
and taught, while nt the tame time he en-
Ueavors to show that there is little or no dif
ference between the precepts of the Christian
t Bible and those of Buddhism, quoting exten
sively from the Old and New Testaments,
which he indorses as teaching the same truths
as those taught by Buddha.
As Buddhismâ iv the form of theosophy and
by Indian teachers â has, within the last few
months, been made to figure very promi
nently before the public, aud as not a few
have been attracted by the sophistries, isen
eralities and b-.-autiful Oriental embelliÂ«h
mems with which it has been presented, I de
sire (if you will allow me to do so through
your columns) to cnll attention to a few plain
lacts concerning Buddhism and compare it
with Christianity. 1 will do so in plain every
day language, without sentimentahsm or â 
philosophical sophistries, so that any intelli
gent reader can know just what it is that is
offend to us in place of Christianity.
It is not denied that Buddhism contains
many moral and social precepts which are
most excellent and which are very similar to
many contained in Christianity, yet these are
bit the expressions of innate convictions of
right ana wrong entertained by almost all
mankind who are appreciably advanced above
savaeery. They are hela even by all who re
iect Christianity ana all other forms of re
ligion. Surely we are noi to swallow a piil of
aead.y substance b-'Cause some one shows us
a few grains of sugar adhering to the surface
of it.
Christianity has its Godâ the infinite, eternal
and unchangeable Being, existing in ana of
him elt from all etenmyâ the Creator, Pre
server. Sorereigu and Redeemer of Men.
Buddhism has no God, but is t-ssentially
atheistic. Buddha is not a divine being who
took the form of man, but iÂ«, or was, a man
who has been annihilated because he arrived
at a state of perfection. There have been sev
eral Buidhas, and there will be at least one
more, who will appear several thousand years
hence.
The doc'rlne Is this: At long intervals of
time there have appeared men who, in many
ages of transmigration from one form and
Mnio of life to another, have so increased in
knowledge and purity that they can rise no
higher, aud so after the next death are born
no more, but pass into annihilation â or, which
is the same thing, their individual existence
has been reabsorted in the infinite substance.
"It is wliile he exists in this final state on
earth, previous to annihilation, that this per
son is Budh, and is worshipped as a god, and
after his death continues to be worshippedâ
not as a present god, but as a memory ; and the
rules and precepts whiyh he has left form the
rule of life, worship and religion of the
people."
Buddha is, therefore, only a supposed saint
exalted into a god, and is anobjici of worship.
The last Buudha to appear was Gandama,
born about the year 626 B. C. Dr. Howard
Malcolm gathers die following information
regarding this Buddha:
"He had previously lived in 400.000,000 of
worlds and passed through innumerable con
ditions in each. In this world he had been
a.most every sort of worm, fly, fish or animal,
and almost every grade and condition of life.
Having iti the course of these transmigrations
attained immense merit, tie was at length born
sou of the King mentioned" (a king in
Hindustan). â¢ * * "The moment he was
born be jumped upon his feet, and
spreading out his arms exclaimed: -Now I
am the noblest of men ! This is the last time I
shall ever be born.' His height when grown
was nine cubits (about thirteen and a half
feet). His ears were so beautifully long as to
hauj: upon his shoulders; his hands reached
to his knees; his fingers were all of equal
length, and with his tongue he could touch
the end of his nose."
This (or the memory of him) is the god of
Buddhism at present, as described in plain
language divested of the ambiguities of
philosophy aud the embellishments of Oriental
speech. This is what Dharmapaia and the
Bramacharin have come to offer to Americans
in place of Christianity's God.
Tne distinguishing peculiarity of Chris
tianity is expressed in the Scripture state
ment, "He that i 9 our 'iod is the God of salva
tion." He saves men from s:u and detith by
redeeming them and putting his spirit within
them. Men are sinners and need salvation,
and this our God fully and gloriously meets.
Buddhism has nothing whatever to say on
this subject. It utterly ignores slu ms affect
ing man's spiritual character and relation to
God and is dumb regarding grace, forgive
ness, etc. It recognizes only inter-human rt
lations and religious forms and ceremonies.
Dna.mapala speaks against priests, theo
logians and ceremonies of Christianity.
Buddhism has more ihan a million priests,
numerous idols, and the essence of its rellclon
is in rites and ceremonies. What he says
About tne ethical teaching* of Buddhism is
only the sweet bait he puts ai the entrance to
catch silly flies.
He quotes liberally from the Christian
Scriptures, indorses the sentiments, and af
firms that h- has thus snown that Christ and
Buddha are "one in spirit" and doctnue. But
you will notice that lie quotes only the moral
preceptsâ those relating to inter-human con
ditions, personal and social. He very rare
tully avoids such quotations as these: "God
so loved me worid that he gave his only be
gotten son, that whosoever b lieveth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life' 1 ;
"The Son of Man cime to give his life
a ransom for many"; "I lay down my life
for the sheep"; "Who his own self bare ou;
sins in his own body on th:s tree"; "Christ,
our Passover, is sacrificed lor us," "Unto
him who loved us and washed us from our
sins in his own Hood"; "He that b.-lieveth
on the Sou hath life, but he that be.i.vetn
not shall not see lite, but the wrath of God
abideih on him"; "With ut the shedding of
blood there is no remission," aitd very many
other such passages.
T ie-e arecareiuily avoided by Dharmapaia,
and these Dhow that Christ and Buddbx,
Christianity and Buddhism, are as tar apart
as truth and error. If Huddlns-n is such a
grand religion, why are the hundreds of mil
lions of Buddhists in India, China and other
Asiatic countries in so low a state of civiliza
tion a* measured by Christian civ lzatlon ?
If Buddhn is one with Christ in doctrine and
spirit, why has Buddh>sm shackled men in
every way while- Christianity hits liberated,
enlarged and ennobled â¢hem ?
Dharm ipaia wants to induce Americans to
adopt BudJhism so that they will be kitd to
animals and s op euting beef. But we have,
our societies for prevention oi cruelty to uni
mals and we like beef too well to give it up.
But that seems to be the reason he wants to
convert us to Buddhism.
No, Mr. Knarmapala and Brftmncharm, we
do not desire to dethrone Jehovah and sut
siitute Buddha; we are Bot ready to substitute
Buddhism for Christianity; we are not ready
to give up the hope of personal salvation
through Christ for annihilation by reabsorp
tion into "infinite substance."
Please go back home and leave us to our
poor Cnrlstlanitv. wfcile you rejoice in the
riches of Buddhism. J. b. Warren.

Marks.
The charge to the jury was given by
Judge Carroll Cook, who gave the usual
statutory definition of "rea-onable doubt"
that ought to be considered by the jurors
In determininc the guilt or innocence of
the accused. It was noted that no men
tion was made of the exercise of "com
mon-sense" in weiching this point. Be
cause the Judge ventured to use this ex
pression at a former tri-1 the verdict of
guilty was set aside ami the defendant
was granted a new trial by the Supreme
Court.
At 5 o'clock Bailiff Whelan reported to
the Court that the jurors were not able to

DISCUSSED FINANCES.
The Mayor and Supervisors Figuring
How to Cut the City Expense
.Accounts
Retrenchment in various municipal de
partments in order to make the deficit in
the funds for this fiscal year as small as
possible was discussed by the Mayor and
Finance Committee of the Board of Surer
visors yesterday.
While no definite conclusion was
reached it was decided to lay over the im
provement of Alamo Square until next
year, thereby working a temporary saving
of $12,000. The question of paying copy
ists in the Recorder's oflice for folios in
printed matter, irhen the only work they
do on them is to fill in dates, was referred
to the City and County Attorney, and it
was discussed whether or not a number of
deputies in the License Collector's office
who are employed in getting new busi
ness could not be dispensed with and the
work done by the policemen on their
various beats.
The Boys' and Girls' Aid Society ex
cense was also taken up and discussed,
the opinion being expressed that children
should not be kept there more than two
months. If at the end of ihat time they
aid not show signs of improvement they
snoui i be sent to a State reform institu
tion where the State could stand the ex
pense. The matter went over to the next
meeting of tiie committee.
LA BERGE CONTRADICTED
Dr. A. H Giannini, a Young In
terne, Adheres to No Broken
Rib Theory.
The Injured M=n"s Wife Signed a
Statement Exonerating tbe Au
thorities From B ame.
The statements made by Charles H. La
Berge, in which charges of neglect and
ill-treatment are nsade against physicians
of the City and County Hospital who
diagnosed his ailment, is contradicted by
the hospital authorities.
To a Call representative Dr. A. H.
Giannini, one of me internes, made the
following statement regarding La Bergt:
"This man La Berge came to the hosDi
tal in a patrol wagon at 10:30 o'clccu on
May 7 and was assigned to ward A, which
is my ward, where he was examined by
Dr. Philip Thomas. About an hour and
a half afterward 1 made an exam. nation
of him and lound no injuries other than
a slicht contusion of the right side.
"There were no ribs broken so far as 1
could ascertain. Tue man was noisy, tie
persisted in talking loud and smoking a
cigarette, which is against the rules of the
iustitution. His wife and a lady friend
were present. Mrs. La Berge gave me to
understand that they had means suffi
cient to pay for medical attendance, and
it was her wish that her husband should
be taken home. To this I offered no ob
jection aud before stie removed him she
signed the following document:
City and County Hospital, )
San Francisco, Cai., May 7, 1897. \
This Is to ceruiy that I remove my husband,
Charles La Berge, lrom the City and County
Hospital against the advice and wishes oi the
medical and surgical staff of physicians. Ido
so of my own Iree will and accord, and am
willing to assume ail responsibility and ab
solve the hospita. authorities from any blame
should anything unforeseen arise in his case
fro m reckless exposure, etc.
Mrs. C. H. La Berge.
"The entire time in which be was in the
hospital was le*s than two hours, and
during that time he was examined as I
have stated by Dr. Thomas, myself and
Surgical Nurse James O'Connor. None of
us discovered any broken ribs."
Nurse O'Connor concurred in this state
ment, but Dr. Thomas preferred to re
main silent.
A positive denial was made regarding
La Berge's statement that be was told
treatment in the hospital was on the score
of charity and that complaints were not
in order.

SITUATIONS WANTED ;; HALE. \
"V[OTICEâ W. D. FWER & CO. HAVK NOT
I.V been to Honolulu. Our hra th has been too
good since our visit to the I^evisla'ure at fairs-
memo. We do n t want to drive the Jups from
Hi>io;ulu lo California,-, as * will assuredly be
the case If t: the Labor Ccmmisslone.'s chi-
merical schem s * be " given ?a - trl*l. All
fake reports to the contrary there is
plenty <,f / work in California for me.i
willing to wcrk. Our farmers, fruit-grow. rs.
contractors and others an- short of men now.
and n politically brought about exoius of already
scarce help would f < rce the Call ornia grower to
pay ruinous piices for the necessary labor to har-
vest his crips. We say, let Honolulu and other
foreign conn. rips â  r'gulatet their own supply
and demand of labor, and let the State
of California rive paramount attention
to the needs of the f California producer.
Under the present depression of prices for products
of all kinds and the generally unfavorable cr<p
reports for the season, owing 10 t'le absence of late
rains, together with the dry north wind*, it would
be i>uicidal to Increase the payroll, and
di crease tie already short supply of labor
by sending California help to Honolulu
or elsewhere, i We .<-peak from 25 years' experi-
ence. We are the only "native sons" in the em-
ployment bus ness, and are naturally interested
in â¢ 'all for nia. We ask our readers locompaie the

I GREAT
STRIKE IN
THE GWIN
Three Million Dollars of
Gold in Seams of
Rich Quartz.
SECOND STRIKE OF THE
MONTH.
First, Heralded as a Rich Dis
covery, Proves Only an
Incident
OWNERS CLOSE AND BOARD
THE MINE.
Progressive Men Who Organized the
Gwin Development Company May
Soon Become Mi lionaires.
Intelligence comes direct from the
Gwin mine, in Caiaveras County, that a
second strike of surpassing richness was
made in that mine early this week. The
taking out of $10,000 in gold a few days
atro was heraided as a rich find and fulls*
described in the columns of this paper.
That amount was taken from a pocket in a
few minutes.
The second strike, which has placed in
sight $3,000,000, is on the 1400 station.
Tiie vein, fourteen feet in thickness, is
seamed with the richest quartz.
When the magnitude and wealth of the
discovery were realized the owners, who
are on the ground, shut down the works
and boarded up the entrance.
For many months the Gwin mine has
been growing in prestige and showing in
creased richness from the 1200 level down
to the presentstation. Last month $17,000
was cleaned up by the forty-stamp mill
which the company maintains.
Mining men who hays received direct
reports from the mine regard the recent
discovery as one of iLe greatest ever made
on tiie mother lode. Great benefits to
Calavera6 and Amador counties are pre
dicted.
Tiie Gwin mine haa a history. It was
once owned by Senator Gwin, who re
ceived as his shnrp of its product a large
sum of money. For some reason the mine
was neglected or improperly conducted
until operations were abandoned. Hav
ing fallen into disuse it fi.led wilt: water,
and little wns thought of reopening it
until F. F. Thomas, who reopened the
Kennedy mine at Jackson, Amador
Couii'y, took 'he enterprise in hand.
11l March. 1803, the Gwin Mine Develop
ment Company vras organized wiih P. F.
Thomas general mai.aser and superin
tendent. He knew that tho mine had pre
viously produced $4,000. ("00, although it
had been closed frmri en years since the
production. M. W. B lsu;iw was made
president of the compauy. Senator E. C.
Voorheis of Amador County vice-presi
dent, and E. L. Parker secretary. These
officers, together with Charles P. Eells
and D. David McClure, constitute the
board of direciors.
The new company .'auk a shaft 425 east
and 1025 feet north of the old workings to
a depth of 1463 feet as the initial develop
ment of the mine. Tiie shaft was begun
in May, 1894, and finished in December,
189(5, with stations cut at the 700. 1000,
1200, 1300 and 1400 foot levels. The old
workings were tapp:d with an oil drill
and drained, the new Â«haft having been
sunk to a greater depih. A modern 40
--stamp mill with sixteen Union concen
trators was erected at the site. In this
work of development the company in
vested $85,000. Tiie ore body developed is
of hi h grade and extends to as high as
iourteen feet in width.
Mr. Thomas has had abiding faith in
the future of the mine from the time the
company was organized. It. is said that
he predicted a creat strike, but the pres
ent strifce is richer ami more extensive
than he anticipated. Miners assert that
teams of v^ibie gold in quarts have been
revealed. The exploration already made
sh.ov.-s a deposit of unusu .1 magnitude.
Last ni^'ht the mining men at the
Palace, Occidental and Lick were talking
of the discovery. Mr. Deidesheimer, at
the Occidental, heard the news yesterday.
He was gratified, but not wholly sur
pr sed. He has been pxnectinsr that
'lhomas would strike it rich in the Gwin.
Mr. Randall came down from the moun
tains yesterday. He reports that the sec
ond strike in the Gwin is regarded as one
of the greatest ever made in California.
Word comes that the company will at
once order two mills, fifty stamps each, as
an addition to the equipment already
available.
The mine is in Calaveras County, about
nine miles distant lrom Sutter* Creek,
Amador County.
Kajg Needed for the Indian Corn.
Rev. Richard Gear Hobbs, who is loading
the CHy of Everett at Port Costa vrith corn
from the prairie States for tlie starving in
India, is trying to raine $3000 in Catlloraia to
pay for the jute begs to contain the corn. "The
sactingi" lie s.iid at the Occidental last nigbt,
"will cost about 5 ceuts a hundred, or $1 a
ton. The grain is l:ee, the ship is free and
the freight is practically free, and we would
like, if poss:uic, to get California to furnish
the sacis. The railroads bring 1000 tons oi
the com from Nebraska and lowa absolutely
lree, and for the remaining 1500 tons charge
only actual cost."

THE CHILDREN
A Big Monkey at Liberty
in the Western
Addition.
Visited the Home of Secretary
Godchaux of the Board
of Health.
Escapes Twice From Mrs Emma L.
Hunt, His Owner, and Is Cap
tured by Ssrvants.
A big brown baboon roaming at large
has been terrorizing mothers and children
of the Western Addition for a couple of
days past, and the former are taking
extraordinary precaution* to see that their
offspring are not injured by the beast.
Little ones rushed into their homes
with frightened faces and stories ol a big
monkey on the Dack fenre, and mothers
armed with brooms or fire-shovels rushed
out to see a grinning simian face looking
at them from an adjacent fence top.
Generally the monkey left when he saw
trouble coming, but on several occasions
he descended into yards as though in
searcti of food and kept the people within
doors until he concluded to change his
foraging ground.
On Wednesday morning the baboon
appeared in thn back yard of the residence
of Edmond Godchaux, at 1429 Weoster
street, and began cutting up capers. A
chain was attached by the strap about the
big monKey's body, and he carried it in
one front paw w: ile he helped himself
about with the o'ber.
Mr. Godcnaux's sister was very much
frightened and dared not go out of the
house until the simian had departed.
Tnen she repor;eu the matter by tele
phone to her brother at the Health Office
and was admonished to keep to the house
and not molest the beast.
YÂ«ste:d&y Mr. Godchaux wa3" again
called up by telephone by his sister, who
told him in an agitated voice that the
monkey had called a.-am.
Mr. Godchaux was about to drop the re
eiver of the phone and rush home to de
fend his sister when he was reassurred by
hearing that all was safe, and that Jocko
wbs captured by the servants of his owner.
While the baboon was disporting him
seli in the yard, this time without a chain
to hamper him, the Chinese cook and
maid of Mrs. Emma L. Hunt, daughter of
Dan T. Cole, the Harbor Commissioner,
and widow of a former member of the firm
of Moore. Hunt & Cj., called at the God
chaux home and inquired anxiously
whether or not a monkey had been seen
about the place. They were directed to
the back yard and Jocko was soon in cus
tody.
Alter the first taste of freedom the mon
key's chain was made more secure, but he
had learned the pleasures of prowling
about other people's back yards and in
stead of getting away by loosening the
chain from iis staple had loosened it from
the belt and started out on a second tour
of exploration.
Mrs. Hunt lives at 1715 Geary street,
and it was but a short run on fences for
the agile monkey to reach the Godchaux
home.
Jocko is now so firmly attached to his
horne â by means of a new chain and belt
that he has no chance to make grimaces
at tbe neighbors except wben he sees them
at upper windows, but the mournful ex
pression ot bis face shows that he longs
for more forays.
DIED BEFORE A MIRROR
R. Linden Carries a Looking-
Glass to the Park and
Shcots H mself.
H* Left a Letter Asking' the Coroner
to Notify His Widow of His
Death
R. Lindon, a man without occupation,
who resided in the Kranz rooming-bouse,
242 Harriet street, committed suicide near
the police station in Golden Gate Park
last evening by shooting himself in the
bead.
The body discovered presumably
about ball an hour after death occurred.
The bead was resting in a pool of blood
and the widely open eyes were staring
straight into a small mirror which the
suicide had used in order that he might
direct the shot straight into his brain.
in the suicide's right hand was tne re
volver, covered with blood which bad
splashed from 'ho wound.
When the body was removed to the
Morgue a letter addressed to 'ho Coroner
was found. It requested that Mrs. Eliza
beth Lindon â presumably the widow of
the deceased â who lives in Slocon City,
British Columbia, be informed of the
writer's death, and alo requested the
Coroner to return the mirror 10 the land
lady of the house in which he resided.
No other papers, with the exception of
two pawn tickets which manifested the
suiciue's financial condition, were found
tbnt would throw any light on the case.
The letter was written on May 11, sev
eral days prior to Lindon's deatn.
It is believed that in the intervening
days between the date of' Us writing and
the suicide of Lindon he bant all his
energies in search of employment, but
failing to find it took the mirror from his
room, went to the park and blew out his
brains.

LOCAL NEEDS IIEST.
Precita V.illcv l> s r.Â«Â« Home Attention
Rather Than a Greater Park.
The sentiments of the residents of Pre
cita Valley, a* expressed through J. T.
Graham oi the executive committee of the
improvement club, is to the effect that the
people of that section will be content with
less than a 500-acre park and a zoological
collection.
What the residents want is better
streets, an eight-class school building for
their children, electric lights, sewerage on
Bryant avenue from Folsom street to
Army, improving Bernal Park, an engine
company and lastly the filling of the
filthy pools of stagnant water. Tnis was
the result 01 the meeting of the club last
night.
President S. A. Byrne stated that secre
tary J. E. O'Brien bad forwarded to the
Supervisors the resolutions passed at the
<ast meeting and he was in lio.es that the
action of the club would bear fruit in the
near future.
H. Behrins stated that the forked road
way of Precita avÂ»nue would be finiined
with the last layer of macadam by the Ist
of June.
HE DID NOT KILL
BLANCHE LAMONT
Convict Rosenberg Was in
Europe at the Time of
the Murder.
All Who Know Him IHieve
He Has Long Been Insane
or Half-Witted.
His Confession Abounls in Absurdi
ties as Wild as tbe Dreams
of Madmen.
Chief Lees and Captain Bohen have
completely punctured the insane story of
convict John Rosenberg of San Quentin,
to the effect that he murdered Blanche
Lamont and was ready to be hanged for
the crime.
The vaporings of the half- witted epilep
tic convict were set forth with monoton
ous detail in a ban Francisco morning
paper yesterday. By an affidavit the un
fortunate was made to say that he was
hired by a stranger to kill Blancne La
mont, and that he did so by choking her
and sticking a sailor's needle into her
bra'.n through the ear. The following are
some of the salient points of the convict's
confession, as prepared tor him by those
to whom it was made:
He said be was born at Eegia, Russia;
came to San Francisco from Hamburg on
the Hooridal, a sailing vessel, arriving in
April, 1895; two days later met a tall man
on the water front, who asked him to meet
btm the next evening on Sutler street,
near the transfer office. The confession
then runs:
I met him next evening according to ap
pointment, and after a long talk he proposed
to me to lake a note to a young woman at a
dchool house on next day, when he would take
me. I was to deliver tne note to her when
school let out and to follow her to a church,
she would go to. I was to follow in end make
away with her as he directed. The
next day this mti 11 met me again at transfer
office, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. He
took me in the cars to a echooShouse on a hill j
where cars crossed, one going down a>;d up I
hi 1 ana the others across. Wo waited fora
short time, when school let out. When the |
girl came out with otheri this mau pointed
her oui, and when she was going to take
the c;.r I delivered the note. She loot it, wen;
on the ear. Â«nd I took the same car and rode
to what they (ailed Market street. She to^k |
another car out and 1 followed by the same
car. and rode many, many blocks away out.
The girl, who ihe man said was Blanche Ls
mout, got off the car and walked a short dis
tance < f a block or so and came before a
chuich. I saw ihe man waiting at the gate.
She spoke to him and they both went in. I
went in also ami snw them go into a small room
to the front Ol the church. The man clossa
the door, whs there a minute or so and cam>;
out, shut the door after him and pointed for
me to go in. I did so, and coming behind her
caught strong hold of her neck anÂ«l choked
her to death, and used then a sailor's needle
behind tier right ear. She was liot able to cry
out, I caught her so sudden. Then 1 looked
around and saw no one about, tuni I then all
aloue carried her body up into ihe tower of
the church, up many stairs, removed her
clothing, hid the pieces aud put blocks I
found of pieces of wood in the church tower
I by her head, put her hands beside the body,
I arranged the body, and then 1 left by the side
door and out of the eate. This man paid me
! $50 betore I went to the school to deliver the
note, and in the evening after I had Silled
Blanche Lament this man met me at the ferry
by appointment and paid me s, few dollars
over $500 more and demanded rae to run
away. 1 crossed the ferry afterward and
traveled to what I now know to be near Fruit
vale.
The balance of the confession tells in ft
weary way how the convict went to Fruit
vale and went to work for Samuel Wells,
and how he was finally arrested for steal
ing a hor-e, for which he is now serving a
term at San Q lentin.
The most casual reading of the man's
story showed tnm to be rattle-weeded.
Everybody in town laughed over its many
improbabilities; but the fact 3 in posses
sion of the Police Department showed be
yond question that the man did not ar
riv- in San Francisco until more than 200
days alter the murder of Blanche Lamont,
while a careful interview with him by de
tective Seymour showed conclusively that
he was insane. He spoke of the church as
being a brick one, with a stone beliry and
stone steps running to the top, and every
detail of his yarn was improbable, while
bis manner was that of a half, idiotic vic
tim of epilepsy.
Spjafcing of" the story yesterday Chief
Lees said:
Convict Rosenberg was not in this country
when the murders of Blanche Lamont and
Minnie Williams occurred. He was beating
about the Oid World until some time in the
spring of 1895, when he shipped as a sailor at
Hamburg on the shiD Hospodar and reached
here more than 200 days later on November 7,
1895. lie deserted on November 12 of that
v">ir and secured employment with Sam
Wells, manager of the "Commercial Transfer
Company at Fruitvale.
The fellow fell in love with another servant
in the house and because she did not respond
to his flame he took coal oil and had a fit in a
stall in the stable. He was discharged, and
subsequently made his war to the penitentiary.
Tne man, according to Mr. Wells and any
body else who has ever seen or conversed
with him, is positively crazy, and his state
ment made to and published by the
Kxaminer is that of an individual
who is out of his mind.
Mr. Wells hired Rosenberg because he needed
a man on a ranch, but he found the iellow
half-witted. He said his sweetheart in Eu
rope had tried to kill him and that his parents
mistreated him when a boy.
Under Sheriff S. G. Benson of San JosÂ«
says that every one wno had anything to
do* with Rosenberg while he was confined
there considered him simple -minded.
Deputy District Attorney \V. A. Beasley,
who conducted the prosecution of Rosen
berg for horse-stealing, says the man gave
a detailed statement on the stand of his
w.anderings, with which his present story
is in striking conflict.
The following tacts were telephoned to
Governor Budd by Chief Lees at an early
hour yesterday. and later it wns learned
that Rosenbere registered at a boarding
house at 32 Broadway on November 7,
being accompanied by one Anderson, a
shipmate, who has positively identified
Rosenberp of San Quer.tin as the same
man who arrived in November, 1895.
To Detective Seymour tne deluded man
cave a Jong, rambling and contradictory
story of his wanderings, sayinc, amone
otuer things:
The belfry was built with stone and brick;
it had a stone floor with stone stairs all the
way up. Thpy had lnrge plain plass windows
up in ;he belfry, lour <>f them, one on each
wall. No pictures were up there. We went
np about four flights of stairs, al stone steps
No wood in ihe belfry at all. I left her tnere.
I am sure thnt the church is a lnrge brick
one. The church was close to the lerry, I
think west oi th" ferry about five blocks. The

When she came oui I hand.a r.er the note. It

Deteciive Seymour's report concludes as
follows:
During this Interview Rosenberg acted very
strangely, crying at times and then rolling
over with laughter. He said he was tired of
the world, that he had never teen in any
trouble before. I talked with him in German
and he answered me Intelligibly and subse
quently stated he could not speak German,
that he was a- Russian and that he did not like
Germans, that they were all bad people. He
pprsisted in saying that he wanted to bo
hanged, that he was tired of living and that
he wanted to b3 hanged to-morrow.
