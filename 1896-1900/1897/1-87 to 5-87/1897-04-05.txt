Demanding the Withdrawal of

CANEA, Crete, April 4.â The work of
disarming the Jbashi Bazouks, who took
part in the sorties against the Christians
who were removing from the peninsula of
. Akro iri yesterday, began to-day. A
number of gendarmes went to the village
of Kalena, where many of the Turkish
regular troops are living, and demanded
the surrender of their arm?. The Bashi
Bazouks were defiant and boldly refused
to give up their weapons. As a result the
European troops were summoned and
they surrounded the village.
Parleying witn the Bashi Bazouki went
on for an hour before any material im
pression was made on them. Finally
they consented to give up their weapons,
which they did with very bad giace,
niucn time being occupied in the process
of disarming them.
A proclamation was issued declaring all
those who withheld their arms would be
shot, .but thii faiied of effect, as only
about 100 yielded. It is known that fully
I*oo more are still in possession of their
arms, and efforts wiil be made to get
t.;em.
The insurgents have exploded a dyna
lu.its cartridge under one of the waiia of
the ,'ort i: Kassai. '
LONDON, Eng., April 4.â The Canea
c irresuondenioi the Times wires a descrip
tion of the right that took place yesterday
on the peninsula of Akrotiri. He says
that about 4000 Moslem irregulars
Btreamed along ttie road from Canea to
Suda. They passed the international
forces and were in full view of the foreign
positions. They began ascending the
hills icward the insurgent position, and
no effort was made to stop them. Two
thousand of them were armed, but the
others were without weapons. The un
armed Moslems were driven down like
moukeys. A story bad circulated that
the powers were gome to allow the
insurgents to move in, and the Moslems
intended to pillage their houses after they
bai gone.
The insurgents' fighting force at Akro
tiri numbers only about 700 men. When
tbe Moslems were within 500 yarns of the
insurgents' lines a parley was held by the
leaders. What passed between them is not
known, but suddenly along both lines
there were almost concurrent volleys. At
first the insurgents had the advantage
and drove the Moslems down the hills.
The latter rallied and, making a fierce
charge, drove the Christians from their
forward posts, where a Turkish flae, which
is still waving, was planted. A moderate
estimate places the killed and wounded
on each side at fifty.
Major Bor, who is in command of the
' gendarmes, and iwo Italian officers as
cended t c hill and parleyed with the
Moslems, trying to stop the righting.
Several of the warships had landed their
guns and were about 10 shell the Moslems
when they saw Major Bor and trie Ital
ians. They then refrained from shooting,
learing ihut they would hit them.
A heavy rain stopped the firing, when
the Christians and the Moslems returned
to their reap ective positions.
Orders have now been given that the
Moslems be disarmed when they enter
the city gate at Cauea. The first few pass
ing through the gate had their guns
taken from them. After a abort rest these
men returned along the Suda road and
warned their approaching comrades, who
hid their arms. Consequently only a few
were obtained.
Several hundred rifles that were dis
tributed by the Governor remained in
town.
ATHENS. Greece, April 4.â M. Zamis,
President of the Uuule, the single Greek
legislative body, recently sent to Mr.
Gladstone a message of gratitude for the
Gtand he hes taken in behalf of Greece
and the Cretan Christians. In his message
M. Zauns said :
"All your glorious life has been full of
combats for justice and liberty. Now
that the Hellenic nation has risen to hgUt
in favor of Crete, wiiicti it bedewed with
blood, you come to uphold anew the
rights of an oppressed race."
Mr. Gladstone's reply to this mrssage
was made juolic here to-day. He said:
"My tract was not written to confer a
favor on Greece, but to di-charge a solemn
duty contributing to redeem my country
noni any rir-K of dishonor which wuuid
have been incurr-d by placing ourselves
in antagonism to the high interests of
justice and freedom. My opinion is that
if the Greeks continue discreet and the
Cretans tirm, their reasonabie self-asser
tion will carry the day, and the power-,
if they should be so unwise as to take a
hostile part, be both discredited" and de
feated."
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 4.
The Porte has prepared a note to Greece
demanding the withdrawal of the Greek
troops io Crete. The note declares that in
The San Francisco Call
the event of the demand being refused the
Porte will hod Greece answerable. It is
stated that the note has already been pre
sented to tne Government at Athena.

LONDON, Eng., April 4.â While various
reports continue to indicate that a block
ade of Greek ports will be made imme
diately, the Chronicle correspondent says
that it has been adjourned for some days,
while M. Hanotaux, tne French Foreign
Minister, produces a mysterious plan.
The dispatch addj that a diplomat as"
sured King George yesterday that there
was no immediate prospect of a blockade,
and he begged his Majesty not to take ac
tion in the belief that a blockade was im
minent; Nobody has the slightest idea of
what the hitch is in the so-called concert
concerning the blockade.
The Times will to-morrow publish a
dispatch from C:tnea saying that nearly
fifteen Moslems were tilled and several
wounded in yesterday's lighting, Ttie
loss of the insurgents is placed at six

ST. PETERSBURG. RrssiA, April 4.â
The semi-official Journal Ue Si. Petersburg
says: "Tne aggressive provocative atti
tude that Greece continues to maintain
with sucn deplorable obstinacy forces the
powers much against their wish to liave
recourse to a blockade of the Gulf of
Athens. Whatever the result of a con-
flict so wantonly provoked, the powers
would never consent to :he aggressors
ever receiving the slightest advantage
therefrom. Tbe complete agreement of
tne powers remains unaltered and they
would, in event of disturbances created by
Greece, know how to localize and, if need
be, suppress them.

LONDON, Exa, April 4.â A dispatch to
the Mail from Copenhagen says that a
conference held by the royal family re
sulted in a resolve to uphold the present
dynasty of Greece.
The Dowager Czarina, who is a daugh
ter of the King of Denmark and a sister of
King George of Greece, is at present in
Copenhagen, where she will remain until
the end of the month.
A cipher telegraph service has been es
tablished between St. Petersburg and Co
penhagen. It is the general conviction
that the Dowager Czarina has succeeded
in influencing the Czar to support the
King of Greece, so far as the support is
consonant with Russia's interest. If this
report be true it will create a sensation.

CONSTANTINOPLE, TrRKEY, April
4. â It is reported that disorders have oc
cured ai Kurji. in the vilayet o! Bitlis. It
is stated that several Armenians were
killed, but no further details are given.
The pressnt outlook is so decidedly un
certain that business in Constantinople
has come to a complete standstill. A gen
eral feeling of uneasiness prevails, and, as
a result, prices at the bourse disDlay a
downward tendency. In stocks yesterday
there was a heavy decline all around.
The diplomats here have telegraphed to
their respective Governments on the
broad lines of the scheme ot autonomy of
Crete, upon which they have agreed. The
details of the plan have not been divulged,
and it is possible that nothing definite
concerning them will be known until the
powers pass on the scheme.
The Embassadors have called the atten
tion of the Porte to the tears that are en
tertained that there will be a massacre of
Armenians at Hadjin, in Anatoiia. which
place escaped the fury of the Turks and
Kurds during the previous massacres.
Wflen the several districts of Anatolia
were being ravaged by the Turks some
months ago the Hod. W. A. Terrill, the
American Minister, warned the Porte
that the Gov.rnment of the United States
would demand the head of the Governor
of Hadjin district If any harm should be
fall the three American lady missionaries
who were located in Hadjin.
Mr. Terrill has now renewed his warn
ing, and nas demanded that a troop of
soldiers be detailed to guard the resi
dences of the missionaries.
A Christian Governor was apDointed
for the vilayet of Hadjin three months
ago, but he has not yet arrived at hi
post.
FRIGHTENED BY THE BIG BO.YD.
No Applications Yet Made for the Position
ot Assistant United States Treas
urer at N w York.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 4.â The Press
says: It is possible there will be no ap
pointment in the near future of a suc
cessor to Conrad N. Jcrdan, whose term
as Assistant United States Trea-urer ex
pires on April 20 So far as the bankers
are aware, there is not a single prominent
candidate for tbe place in the field.
Tbe bond required is $800,0J0 and that
fact friphtens those who would apply ior
the place, so it appears that there is a
strong possibility of Mr. Jordan's reap-
Dointment, as he is be.ng urged by his
friends to become an applicant. The
Deputy Assistant Treasurer, Maurice
Muehlman, who is well qualified to till the
position, refuses to allow his name to be
used unless Mr. Jordan declines the re
appointment. t
Mr. Jordan is a pold Democrat and it is
understood that he voted the Republican
ticket at the last election, hence he has tbe
Indorsement of all tne Democrats in Wall
street, as well as many Republicans, who
argue that it would not be unwise to cive
it to a man who has ruanaced its affairs in
a business-like manner. The bond of the
present Treasurer becomes void after the
term of his appointment.
Unless there la an appointment before
April 20 it will become necessary for the
United S:ates Treusurer to tase charge of
t: c sub-treasury until an appointment is
made.

Whether the gas had been turned on by

fact that so far as known neither the

to the theory of accident.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 4.â A tel

Times says that the tug Alexander was
brought in there last night in charge of
an officer from tbe cruiser Vesuvius. The
Government vessel came in to-day. The
tvs was seized on Cumberland Sound on
suspicion of being a filibuster, but as
nothing suspicious was found on her she
was held on the charge of violating the
navigation laws, being without lights
when seized by the Vesuvius.
The cruiser was out all night and her
appearance spoiled a large expedition
that was ready to sail from that place.
The tug Panama was lying at the docfc
there at midnight with several large
barges alongside of her, loaded with arms
and ammunition. When the Jones came
in they took alarm and the barges were
run off up the St. Mary's River and hid.
so that when the Vesuvius came in she
found nothing suspicious on the tug. As
the tug was fired up and bad a big lot of coal
on, she was viewed with suspicion. The
Jones had a lot of coal on, it is said, and a
very laree crew for so small a vessel.

C AH NOT PAY THEIR CREDITORS.
Abbey, Schoeffe/ and Grau Refused a Re-
newal of a â -==, and They Will Aban
don Operatic Enterprise.
NEW YORK, N. V.. April s.â The Her
ald says: Abbey, Schocffel and Grau,
limited, are not to be given a renewal for
next season for their present lease of the
Metropolitan Opera-house, and they will
abandon all further opera; ic enterprises.
They will proceed shortly either to
wind up their business altogether or con
fine their attention to the Tremont Thea
ter, Boston (which they own, abovÂ« a
mortgage of $100 000.) They will run
this Boston house in an endeavor to
make its earnings pay off the creditors,
or they may decide to sell it and compro
mise with the creditors; or the creditors
themselves, who are in effect the corpora
tion now, may ask a final dissolution of
the corporation on the ground of default
in heavy payments that will become due
from time to time.
On July 1 next nearly $40,000 la due on
notes to creditors, and to meet this Day-
ment there is at present nothing in the
treasury and nothing in sitht; and with
the opera-house lea;e canceled there
is nothing in the future beyond
what may be earned from the Tremont
Theater. What course will be followed
in their affairs by the corporation is not
yet determined upon; but one thing is
certain, and that is that the opera
house lease will not be renewed
and the firm of Abbey, Schoeffel
& Grau, limited, must necessarily cease
to exist. They will conclude their opera
engagement in Boston, will come to New
York next week and give their farewell,
but when the final curtain fulls on Satur
day, April 17, it will have rung down the
last performance in the opera house by its
present lessees.
The Metropolitan's directors will not
close the house next season. They are de
termined to give opera at the Metropoli
tan, and are exceedingly sorry to find that
the corporation is unable to make
such a showing as will warrant
a renewal cf the lease. They have
been ereatly pleased with the quality of
the operatic season which M. Grau has
provided, and have no fault to find with
anybody who appertains to the artistic
direction of the company.
But the directors insist upon a capital
that shall provide against any contin
gency that may arise and leave enough
to meet any heavy deficit that is like'y to
occor here or there in a lengthy season.
This has been put before the Abbey,
Scnoeffel & Grau directors plainiy, and
they have been unable to meet it with
any satisfactory showing:.
The reason why the corporation is now
without funds or prospects this side of
next season's opera subscription can
be readily explained. In a nutaheil,
the corporation has been run,
not on capital, but on prospects; not on
money belonging to the corporation, but
borrowed from friendly resources. In
short, it has been run on credit and an
advance subscription.
FLEEING TO HIGHER GROUND.
There Is Yet Consternation Among Set
tlers Along the Rapidly Rising
Rivers,
SIOUX CITY, lowa, April 4.âResi
dents of the Floyd River bottoms here are
again fleeing to higher ground. At Mer
rill, James and Hinton, points above Sioux
City, the stream is out of its banks and
flooding the valley here. The bank is
higher and a three-foot rise will be neces
sary before the floods of a fortnight ago
can be repeated. The rise still progresses,
however, at the rate of two or three inches
an hour.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 4. -The
weather here to-day has been clear and
bright and most favorable to the levees,
which are standing the strain well. The
flood situation here is unchanged. The
river is rising and will continue to do so
for reveral days, unless breaks should oc
cur above here. It is understood that the
alarming dispatches have been sent from
here by the sensational news managers,
but the situation at this place is not one
to excite apprehension. The river lack
several inches of reaching the flood record
of 1893.
"WASHINGTON. D. C, April 4.â The
following reports have been received at
the D?partnient of Agriculture Weather
Bureau from officers in charge of river
districts:
St. L'juis, Mo.â Less rain has fallen than an

will come out of the Missouri River by Tues
day.
Cairo, 111. â The river has risen one-tenth of
a foot since Saturday morning. It is now on a

rains is, in some few places, upon the side
walks of graded streets.
Memphis, Term.â The flood situation shows
no improvement, and In the vicinity of Helena
it is hourly becomiug more critical. Owing to
heavy rains in this section the river at Mem
phis shows a slight rise, but no marked change
is expected at present.
Helena. Ark.â River 51.5, rainfall .89.
Levee broke four miles below town aud will

Vicksburg, Mi6s. â Crevasse reported at
Flower Lake, Miss., six miles below Austin,
Tunica County.
New Orleans, La.â River rising, 17.8. This
is within one-tenth of a foot of the highest
water ever previously recorded. Heavy rains
have occurred in the past twenty-four hours
in the watersheds of the Arkansas, Cumber
land and Tennessee, and along the central
Mississippi River; heavy rains or snows in the
upper Missouri and light rains in the upper
and lower Mississippi and the Ohio rivers.
The Mississippi has risen from St. Paul to the
mouth, except a fall of one-tenth of a foot at

BAY CITY

VICTORIOUS
The Varney Relay Cup
Now Their Permanent
Property.
CENTURY RECORD AGAIN
LOWERED.
Gallant Jim Kenna's Spectacular
Finish on a Crippled
Wheel.
HIS COMPETITORS BADLY DIS
TANCED.
There Were Few Accidents and
Altogether It Was the Most Suc
cessful Relay Vat Held.
Jim Kenna's wheel was crippled and
wobbling when that gallant rider reached
the Alameda suburbs, but, like a true
Spartan, he tore along unmindful of the
dangers of broken limbsâ thinking only
of victory for his colors â and now for the
third successive year the glory of the
great century relay belongs to the Bay
City Wheelmen.
It was a great and exciting race, beset
with hardship and mishap throughout
ttie 100 miles, and the victorious club has
it to say that it won en its merits. It had
an uphill battle after the first ten miles,
because of the bad luck of Davidson, the
Bay Citys' standard-bearer in the initial
relay, but its old-time pride, pluck and
determination asserted itself once more
and a grand victory was achieved where
defeat seemed inevitable.
The trophy, the celebrated Varney cup,
is now the property of the Bay City
Wheelmen for keeps. Under the con
ditions governing the competition for this
handsome prize, it had to be won three
times by the same cycling organization,
and by purely amateur riders, before it
could boast of a permanent owner. The
Bay Citys landed top honors in 1895, again
last year, and then added the finishing
touches in yesterday's event.
The scene on Central avenue, in
Alameda, across which was stretched the
tape marking the finish of the one hun
dred miles, was a repetition of that of
lormer year?, but with the exception that
there was a far greater crowd there to
welcome the athletes who pc laled the
last ten-mile relay, and far more excite
ment and enthusiasm than ever.
For blocks and blocks along the
avenueâ in fact, throughout the entire
last mile of the course â the sidewalks
were black with spectators, and finally the
throng reached auch proportions that the
walks would no longer provide the neces
sary room for the waiting thousands, and
they began to encroach upon the avenue,
despite the fact that it had been stoutly
barricaded with ropes and was patrolled
by specially appoin.ed marshals and the
Alameda police.
But crowds are crowds wherever you
find them. They will have their way
about things, an<l yesterday's great gath
ering wa-i no exception to the rule. It
went to Alameda to see the iinUh of the
preaiest race of the year, and see It it
would. But withal it was an orderly and
good-natured gathering, even if the rule*
reeardine the ropes were ignored.
It was another ideal day. such as Ala
mcda always generously provides for the
relay event. It gave the visitors an op
portunity to carry their wraps and over

As might be expected, the Alameda

foreotten and lost sight of in the anxiety
and intense interest that attached to the
closing chapter and the proclaiming of the
victor.
Ten clubs had zone into the contest with
their very beet trained riders. Only one
could win. Pride and an aching for glory
spurred all of them on, and it was a battle
all the way. It was no wonder then that
the 100 miles were covered in six miuutes
faster time than they were last year, nor
that the record was once more splintered.
The marshals and police were making a
last desperate effort to regain control of
the swaying and struggling crowd when a
lad who I; ail appointed himself lookout and
was perched upon the topmost point of a
telegraph pole shouted out that he could
discern far up the avenue the outlines of
a wheelman who, from his costume and
the desperate manner in which he was
riding, was undoubtedly the leader in the
great relay.
A shout went up from the crowd, and as
It was taken up all along the dense line
for bloci after block, it developed into a
defeamng roar. All thoughts of order and
decorum were forgotten nnd in a trice
the ropes were torn irom their fastenings
and everybody was prancing about ex
citedly in the middle of the avenue in
complete defiance of the guards.
''Can you make out his colors yet?"
shouted one of the timers through his
hands ana directing his remarks to the
lookout
"No, there's somebody in the way,"
came from the top of tbe poie. "His
head is down and he's riding like the
wind. He is â hold on â now I can see
him â he's a Bay City rider!"
Wow! There was noiÃe enough before,
but now pandemonium had broken loose.
"It's Kenna! Hurrah for Kenna !" The
Bay City men were delirious with excite
ment and danced about like Fiutes,
waving sweater-, ihroiwng their caps into
the air and yelling themseives hoarse.
And they had a right to, lor they had
won a great victory. Everybody, too,
(seemed to share in their joy and shouted
and shouted again with them.
"Make room for the winner," was the
order that now swept through the con
fused mass of human beings. A narrow
aisle, from either side of which thousands
of heads bobbed and necks craned, was
quickiy formed and through it swept
Kenna, perspiring and tired, but the hero
of the day.
There was another wild scene when this
athlete crossed the tape just as one of the
pedals snapped from Ins wheel and the
machine itself collapsed. Kenna did not
fall. He cleverly rfisongageii himself from
the wreck and delivered Mayor Pheian's
letterâ the document thai had been car
rieil over the century circuit â to Chairman
Foederer of the Alameda Board of Trus
tees. Ha>i Kenna been compelled to ride
another hundred yards he could not have
finished without an accident.
The wonder is that lie ever got home en
that wheel. Two miles from the tape his
rear tire flattened and he was compelled
to ride on the rim. Then one of the pedals
loosened and the whole machine beL-an to
wobble; but the lad would not stop â no,
it was do or die with him, and he kept on
as long as he could keep his balance on
the machine.
"I had one thing to console me,
though," said Kenna, af;er the race, "and
that was that none of my rivals were near
enough to me to make trouble. Even if
my wheel had collapsed I believe 1 would
have had time to borrow one Irom one of
my trailers and still win out the race for
my club."
Wing of the Olympic Club was next to
Kenna in the last relay, and crossed the
tape within a few seconds of two minutes
behind the Bay City mar. Bates of the
Reliance Club came in third, three min
utes behind Wing; Decker of the Acme
Club was fourth and right on the heels of
Bates. The representatives of the ether
contesting clubs came strangling in dur
ing the succeeding eight minutes. The
color-bearer of the Alameda Cyclers was
the only one who did not finish.
HOW THE RACE WAS RUN.
Events Along the Line of tho Relay
Course.
Promptly at 9 o'clock the ten men who
were to ride the tirst relay were instructed
to line up by Starter John F. McGlynn.
Owing to the immense crowd around the
starting point at Tenth and Market
streets it was some little rime before a
space could be cleared sufficiently wide to
allow each man a fair start, but at ten
minutes past 9 everything was in
readiness and he gave them the word to
go. The course lay down Market street
one block to Ninth street, and each man
â¢was desirous of reaching the corner first, so
as to lead on the ride down the Ninth
street cable siot as far as Polsom street.
Itosenheim of the Ileliauce Club whs the
lucky one, ar.d the order behind him, as
the men strung out down Ninth street
was Smith (Olympic), Harden brook (Gar
den City), Davidson (Bay City), Scott
(Acme), Carpenter (Alaraeda). Eirdsal
(California), Huhert (Capital City),
.riamann (Imperial) and Robinson (San
Francisco. Before the turn at FoUom
street was reached, however, Davidson
bad sprinted ahead and assumed the lead.
The pharp turn into Folsom street was
pafely made, an immense crowd of specta
tors being present at this coint to see the
men pass. Out the asphalted boulevard
the men flew along, Davidson and Harden
brook setting most of thÂ« pace. Another
turn was ma^e at Twenty-filth street, and
here the rirst accident of the race oc
curred â Davidson's rear tire went flat
from a puncture, and he soon found him
self riding on the rim of the wheel and
losing ground at every turn of the pedals.
At the Potrero avenue turn be secured the
loan of another wheel irom a boy standing
by and was soon chasing hotly after tbe
bunch now gome distance ahead of him.
Scott of the Acmes meanwhile had also a
puncture, and suffeied two more and rode
three strange wheels before he finished his
relay. Davidson punctured again, got an
other wheel from a cluomate dose at
hand, pulled the handle burs out of that
one on the Six-mile bill, got another
wheel from John Leavitt, whom the Bay
Citys nad stationed on tiie Inn for just
Buch an emergency, and again punctured
that before he finished. In >pite of all his
accidents Davidson beat Scott and Car

The exchanges of the packets at the end
of tbe first relay were perfect, and the
crowd of people who hai taken the trouble
to go down the road ten miles to witness
the rcene were well repaid for tneir long
journey. Coulter Whi first off, his club
niate, Bird sail, having led at the end of
the first relay, but it was not to be that he
s ould remain there. He ran into Henry
Noonan near the end of the relay, and
though Noonan suffeied more personally
from the encounter Coulter lost more time
for his club. Noonan was badly bruised
about the ankle and Coulter much shaken
up, but they remounted and finished the
ride. Delmas beat the bunch out in the
sprint, and the Garden Citys had won the
first place at the end of th? secona relay.
Schleu'er of the Acme Club, by a remark
ably fast ride, made up a great deal of the
time Bcoit lost on the first, bringing his

nan, too, had speeded well, and in sp te
of his fall and tbe consequent loss of time
the Bay Citys were now in fifth place,
three notches ahead of what they were on

At the very beginning of the third there
was trouble. Georjje Fuller, the O ympic
rider, slipped and fell as he wns Retting
under way. and smashed his wheel badly.

the one his predecessor, Cook, had just

The end of the sixth relay was also de
void of anythine sensational. The three
foremost clubs held the vÂ«ry same places
and rode in the same time. The Acmes'
man was perhaps 100 yards behind and
the clubs behind him had not changed
their positions. They all "stayed by the
baggage," hoping afeainst hope and trying
their best to overcome the lost ground.
This relay was through San Jose and
ended at Berryessa. An immense con
course of people lined the streets of the
Garden City to watch the riders pas?, and
while the fact that their home club was
nearly three minutes behimi somewhat
dampened their enthusiasm, they remem
bered thst the Bay Citys, in just such a

Neither did the seventh relay show any
material change in positions. At the
end the Olympics still led, but only
by two seconds; the Bay Ciiys had ad
vanced one notch and were in second po
sition by fifteen seconds over the Reliance
Club and the Acmes were close upon
them. This relay was supposed to be a
very weak spot in the B;.y Citys' team, ac
cording to the prognostications of a cycling
writer in a morning paper. Haley was
said to be an unknown quantity, the in
ference being that ha lacked the speed and
endurance neressary to carry him over
the course as fast as the men from other
clubs would ride it. But despite these
predictions he worried along and was
within a second of making the fastest
time. The Alamedaa had dropped back
so far that no time was taken, and al
though they eventually finished the race
there is no rerord of their riding times
after the sixth relay.

And then came the ninth, the relay on
which lor the past two years Emil Ul
bricht of Lob Angeles had won tue event
for the Bay City Wheelmen. TJihricht is
down in South America now repairing bi
cycles for the King of Peru, or the Em
peror of Ecuador, or some other such
high-titled luminary of the tropics, but
the Bay C.tys found a splendid substitute
for him in another speedy, determined
Teuton, Charley Kraft, formerly ol Beni
cia. Kraf i is paid to be one of the great
e-t unpaced road riders in the worid, and
be maintained his reputation by his ride
of yesterday.
The story of this relay is best told in a
few wor Is by George E. Dixon of the Bay
City Wheelmen, who was Kraft's trailer,
as follows:
"We started out on about equal terms.
Kralt, Bay City; Kroetz, Olympic, and
Yeoman, Reliance. I followed behind as
trailer for Kraft and Clarence Davis as
trailer for Kroetz. We jogged along at a
three-minute clip, talking and joshing,
for about three miles, until we were well
past Alvarado, Kralt, Yeoman and Kroetz
setting the pace. Finally I tbougiit it
was about time for Kraft to wake up, so I
said, 'Lieht out, Charley,' and, say, you
would have thought we were standing
still the way he left us. We tried to hold
him, but it was out of the question. Yeo
man soon quit, and though Kroetz, Davis
and I kept along as best, we could, we
could see Krait was gaining on Ui at every
turn of the pedals.
"We saw Syd Vincent swing in alone
fide Kraft some distance up the road. He
siayeil alongside about a second and was
then satisfied Â».o fall in behind him, and
be didn't last there more than 300 yards.
And you Know Byd is no slouch of a roail
rider himself. I knew we had the race
won then, and wasn't much surprised
when they told me at the end of the relay
that Kraft had handed the packet to
Kenna fully two and a half m nutes before
the Olympic man came alonp."
The Caiifornias took a backward move on
this relay. They had held sixth place
right along this far, but Muller through
misfortune to his wheel lost time for
them, and they dropped back to ninth
place, which was practically last; the Aia
niedas were so far out of the race.

The raca was practically decided by
Kraft's pnenomenai ride on the ninth,
and little but the incidents of the tenth
need b" told. Kenna ior the .Bay Citys
was off over two minutes ahead of the
oihera. He punctured his rear tire haif
way out and rode it in flÂ»t the remaining
five miles, much to the damage of the tire
and rim, lie was followed in by three or
four members of his own club, who were
ready to exchange wheels wish him should
any of his competitors come in sight from
behind, making a hard lini-li necessary.
But his lead was so ereat it was unneces
sary. Wing for the Olympics came along
two minutes later, then Bates (Reliance)
and Decker (Acme), three minutes behina
Wing, and fighting to get through the
crowd which liad by tliis time surged
around the finish to congratulate Kenna.
The other clubs came straggling in iater

- Fasttst timeâ lÃ94, 32:05; 1895, 'i8:0l- 1896
31:01.
The time made by the ten men in the
Bay City G ub was 4 hours, 4'J minutes, 39
seconds, which U 6 minutes ami 33 sÂ«c
onda faster man the time of laat year's
race.
This makes the third successive year
that the Bay Ciiys nave won the great
relay race, and thereby they become en
titled to the possession for all time of the
Vamey relay trophy, an elegant silver
ciio.- The only other clud thai ever won
it was the Garden City Cyclers of dan
Joe the first time the relay was run iv
1894.
ln the packet which each rider carried
wus enclosed a letter from Mayor Pheian
of this City to Hon. Jo<vpi: Forderer,
president of the Board ot Trustees of the
city of AlamÂ»da, explaining the purpose
of the race. Kenna delivered his packet
to Mr. Fonlerer, who wa< present at the
finish, immediately upon his arrival.
The many intriv.au- details and arrange
ments for the rice were admirably hand
lea by the ro;id-rucinEand records commit
tee of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs, consisting of Charles Albert Adams
Chester Myrick and A. W. Weihe. The
regularly appointed board oi timers,
judges, scorers, etc., of the association
officiated at the start and finish, and on
each relay these offioials were furnished
by the various clubs competing, one from
each club.
The imoression is general that the best
team won the bis race. Not only were
the men the fastest riders, but by atten
tion to little details the club's officers had
everything so well arranged that for them
to lose the race by ordinnry accidents,
such as punctures or broken "whpels, was
almost impossible. For instance, on the
first relay the Bay Cuys had twenty ex
tra men stationt-d half a mile apart with
an extra wheel ready for Davidson i| he
needed it. And th^ value of ths service
is shown when it is said that Davidson
had to change weels five times. Tb<Â» same
tweniy mon, after the rirs: relay was run,
crossed the bay and spread themselves out
over the ninth and tenth relay*, ready to
lend aid to Kraft or KÂ»nnÂ» if necessary.
Out of 166 members which the Bay City
Club has, 142 had some actual duty to
perform on the day of the race, and every
last one of them did what he was told to
Great credit is due to Frank H. Kerri
gan, president; Henry L. Day. captain;
George P. Wetmore, Frank H. Waters,
and other prominent members of the
club, for the interest they took in the
club's team, and the time and car* they
spent oa toe placing and arranging of the
men.
'The annual relay race of California is
one of the greatest cycling events in the
United States. Looking at it topograph
ically there is no other locality so favored
for such a race as around the bay of San
Francisco. And similar events in -the
East on straightaway courses do not com
pare with ours for time made or the in
trirest taken by 13 c riaers and the public.

OF A PHYSICIAN
Cut His Throat While in
Lincoln Park at
Chicago.
Many Out for Enjoyment of the
Spring Day Horrified by
the Act
Insanity the Only Theory for the Sen
sational Self-Murder cf an
lowa Doctor.
CHICAGO. 111., April 4â Dr. J. H.
Walton, a well-known physician of Du
buque, lowa, committed suicide in a sen
sational manner in Lincoln Park this
afternoon. He was walking along one of
the driveways with a friend when sud
denly he drew a razor from his pocket and
cut his throat. The windpipe was severed
r.nd the physician died within a few min
utes.
Dr. Walton arrived in the city this
morning in company with Dr. S. S. Lind
say of Dubuque, and both men registered
at the Palmer House. Shortly before
noon they walked out together to view
some of the points of interest, and about
1 o'clock arrived at Lincoln Park.
The driveway was thronged with vehi
cles and bicycle-riders. Many persous
were walking about, and the seats
throughout the park were filled.
Almost to the very moment that Dr.
Walton took his life he had been talking
pleasantly with his companion. Sud
denly he walked rapidly ahead and cut
his throat with a razor. The tragedy was
witnessed b3' a number of persons who
had gone to the park to enjoy the beauti
ful spring day, but almost before Dr. Lind
say or any of the horrified spectators
could reach him the physician had ex
pired.
The police were notified and the body
was removed to the morgue. Dr. Lindsav
said he knew no cause for Dr. Walton's
act. He believes, however, that the man
was suddenly seized wiih insanity. Both
men expected to attend the meeting of
physicians in this city this evening, and
Dr. Walton had prepared to deliver an
address.
The suicide was about 30 years old and
was prominently connected.
ROBBERY OF RECEIVER McNEAL.
Although He Is Yet Too Dzzsd to Tell a
Straight Story It Is Thought He
Lost Considercb/e Money.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 5.â A Sun
special from Rochester, N. V.. says: Ed
ward McNeal, receiver of the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company, was at
tacked by robbers in a Central-avenue
saloon Saturday night, rendered uncon-
Miousbya blow from an ax or icepick
and supposed to have been robbed of a
considerable sum of money. He was taken
to Bt. Mary's Hospital in this city, and is
still in such a dazed condition that the at
tendants are unable to obtain any coher
ent statement from him.
Yesterday morning Superintendent of
Police Clearv received his first intimation
of the affair, when he read the report sub
mitted by Officer Sullivan, who said in
hiÂ« report that a man giving his name as
"E. McNeal'' fell down near the Kremlin
House, on North St. Paul street, and cut
his head. He was taken into the Krem
lin House and later removed to Dr. Turn
more's office. The ambulance of St.
Mary's Hospital was summoned and he
was taken to that institution.
Sullivan's theory was that it was merely
an accident. Superintendent Cleary de
tailed Detectives Swan ion and McDonald
to investigate the case and they went to
St. Mary's Hospital and tried to talk to
McNeal yesterday. The latter was in no
mood to say anything.
He finally said that he was on a Central
Hudson train on Saturday night, and
when the train stopped at Rochester he
left his satchel on the seat and got off to
buy a drink. He had to go back further
than he expected to obtain the arink and
when he got back to the station he found
that the train had cone, taking his satchel
with It. He wandered around for a long
time and fell in with some tough charac
ters, who wanted to whip him. There was
a light and McNeal cot tne worst ot it.
He wandered out of trae saloon into Ihe
BTeetand finally staggered into th 6 Krem
lin House, where he was taken care of.
Tne story told by McNeal was so ram
bling that the detectives dia not put much
credence in it. He still Beemed to be
dazed and related several different stories
to account for bis cuts and bruises. He
said nothing yesterday about being
rubbed.
In his first story of the affair, told on
Saturday night, he said that his satchel
was taken from aim by robbers, and that
it contained considerable money and some
Valuable papers.
Superintendent Cleary does not be
lieve that McNeal Â»vas robbed. He said
he does not believe a robber wonld leave
two valuable rings on a man's finger and
a tine gold watch ia his pocket if he was
really bent on robbery. This theory does
not take into account the fact that the
thief might have been compelled to flee
to escape detection. The superintendent
Bays that there is no doubt that McNeal
was villainously assaulted, and that the
officers will get at the facts of the case as
rapidly as possible.
At a late hoar last night no arrests had
been made. At midnight McNeal was
still in a dazed condition and it is feared
that bis skull is fractured. In any event,
he will not be able to leave the Hospital
for several days. It is learned that bis
private car is awaiting him at Chicago.
His latest version of the affair is that he
was struct on the head with an ice pick.

TWO MINISTERS SELECTED.
Buck of Georgia Goes to Japan and Arthur
Se wall's Son Gets the H, wanan
Mission..
NEW YORK, N. V., April 4 âA World
special from Washington says: A. E.
Buck of Georgia has been offered and ac
cepted the position of Minister to Japan.
His nomination will be sent to the Senate
this week. He is about 60 years old and
has been a Republican leader in Georgia.
Buck went South from Maine shortly
after the war and during reconstruction
days and represented the Mobile (Ala.)
district in Congress. He subsequently
went to (*eor?ia and was clerk of the Fed
eral court at Atlanta. He also served as
United States Marshal of that district.
It is not believed here that a Minister to
Hawaii will go to Honolulu on the cruiser
Philadelphia, which is expected to sail
from San Diego on Wednesday. It is said
that Harold E. Sewall. son of Arthur J.
Sewall. candidate for Vice- President on
the ticket with Uryan, has been selected
for the position. Because objections may
be raised to his confirmation it is not
thought probable he will sail prior to the
announcement of his confirmation.
The statement is made that Mr. Sewall's
conversion to Republicanism is too recent
to entitle him to a place of such promi
nence. This may be used against him in
the Senate.

.Long-Standint; Strikm Off.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 4.â At the
meeting of the Central Labor Union in
Clarendon Hall this afternoon the long
standing strike of the steam-fitters was
announced off. Chairman Seth Low's de
cision on the quarrel between the plumb
ers and steam-litters was accepted and the
s'.eam-titiers will go to work to-morrow,
though they feel rather sore over the vic
tory of their old rivals.
It was the general opinion of the men
interested that the trouble was not at an
end, except in so far as the acceptance of
President Low's decision went.
The plumbers who have been on strike
will return to work to-morrow on the
orders of the walking delegates. But they
repeated their declaration of yesterday
that >trikes would be ordered "in every
building where non-union steam-litters
are continued in employment.

BORNE DOWN BY
AN AVALANCHE
Monte Cristo Miner Meets
Death Under Sliding
Snow.
Overtaken by the Tumbling Mass
While Descending the
Cascades.
Rescuing Party F.nis Hi* Frci n Body
at the Eotiom of Glacier
Basin.
EVERETT. Wash., April 4.â Heavy
snows, followed by Chinook winds, are
causing immense avalanches in the Cas
cade Mountains. Edward Graham was
killed by a snowslide on Friday in Glacier
Basin, Monte Cristo raining camp.
Graham, in company with Daniel Sher
fey, started down from the Pride of the
Mountain mine to transact business, his
intention bring to send his wages to bis
family in Denver. When they had ar
rived opposite the cookhouse of the Mys
tery mine the snow started, apparently
from the bottom, a phenomenon that sur
prises all who are not familiar with the
mountain country.
Sherfey succeeded in keeping on the
surlace during his perilous ride of over
100 feet, but his unfortunate companion
was carried under the tumbling and heav
ing mass. The last seen of him were his
arms sticking abuve the snow for a second,
only to disappear until the poor fallow
was found under seven feet of snow,
packed like ice, by a rescuing party of
miners from the Mystery miue.
The deep snow is delaying mining
operations Rt Monte Cristo, where the
ground is covered to a depth of twenty
feet, and in other camps. Last week a
tramway near Snohomish collapsed under
the heavy weight of snow. In the Trail
Creek district several mines have sus
pended operations, and the Le Roi has
laid off over 100 men on account of the
snow blockade on the railroads. If the
present rapid thaw continues the sur
rounding valleys are likely to be inun
dated.

Mr. Smith was seen by a Calt, corre
spondent belore he left for the metrop
olis, and questioned as to the purpose of

the United States capital foran important
interview with President McKinlev. He
declined to state the object cl the confer

witu the Japanese, Mr. Smith declared

THAT NEW TREATY
OF ARBITRATION
It Will Not Be Pressed to
Consideration in the
Senate.
The Stat2 Department tD Be
Given a Chance to Study
Amendments.
There Is a Promise of a Renewal of
the F:glit on the Indian
Bill.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 4â lt is
said that Acting Chairman Davis of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee does
not intend to press the arbitration treaty
for consideration daring the present week.
The debate on the treaty has been pro
tracted, and now that the last amendment
permissible has been offered and voted
and the convention as a whole is in shape
in which it must be finally ratified or re
jected there appears to be a disposition to
halt for a short session. Several reasons
combine to make such a policy probable.
No arrangement has yet been made with
respect to pairs on the final vote, and as
this is a matter solely between individual
Senators some time must ensue before the
pairs can be adjusted, arising out of the
fact that two affirmative votes will be
paired with one negative vote, the action
of the Senate being determined by a two
thirds vole.
It is also understood that Chairman
Davis desires to permit (he State Depart
ment to have a few days in which to study
the changes that have beon made In the
treaty. Unless, therefore, some one de
sires to speak on the subject, Davis will
not move an executive session for the pur
pose of continuing the debate until sev
eral chances have elapsed. The chances
for the ratification of the treaty remain
precarious.
The Senate Appropriations Committee
reported the agricultural bill early i;i the
session and it may be called np at any
time. Tuesday the sundry civil and the
Indian bill will be ready. The latter bill
will, no doubt, lead to some discussion,
owing to one or two Senate amendments
that will open the door to the fight that
was made over this bill last session.
Elkinsof West Virginia will deliver a
speech on his bill to-morrow, providing
for a 10 per cent tax on goods brought to
the United States in ships not those of
this country. This speech has been pre
pared with great care and treats of this
subject exhaustively. The purpose of the
bill is indorsed by a plank in the National
platform and has been approved in the
State conventions of fifteen States. Elkins
intends to foic? the bill to the front and
believes this Concress will enact it into
lnw. While the subject has been touched
upon in the discussion, it has never been
so fnlly and thoronghly treated as it will
be by Elkin* to-morrow.
The bankruptcy bill still remains the
unfinished business on the Senate ealed
dar.
Unless the Senate shall hay? passed one
or more of the appropriation bills now on
its calendar by Wednesday, when the
House of Representatives meets, an ad
journment will be taken by that body un
til Saturday.
The probabilities are strongly in favor
of a do-nothing week in the House.

GOES AS A TRAMP
IN MAN'S ATTIRE
Young Woman Starts on a
Walk From Fresno
to Texas.
Her Traveling Garb a Suit of
Clothing Stolen From Her
Employer.
Had Found Friend* Among Strangers,
bat Loaged to Return to Her
Childhood's Hcme.
FRESNO, Cal., April 4.â Miss Clara
Jensen, aged 22, is now a full-fledged
knight of the road. Dressed in man's
garb, with a roll of blankets across her
back, sne is presumably stepping the rail
road ties in her travels to the soutn. To
night she may bo sleeping in an impro
vised bed in some hay mow, thinking over
her proÂ»pacts of success in applying at
some farmhouse in the morning for her
breakfast.
Miss Jenson arrived in this city a few
weeks ago from Snn Francisco. She was
found at the Valley road depot without
money or friends, and was taken in charge
by the Salvation Army. Seven years ago,
she said, she had run away from the home
of her parents in Fort Worth, Texas, with
a man wno took her to San Francisco, and
there deserted her about a year later. Her
life from then on had been wayward, but
she was repentant ana desirous of return
ing to her parents, who had never heard
from her since she elope 1.
Miss Jensen started Irom San Francisco
without funds, with the purpose of walk
ing to Fort Worth. She footed it most of
the way to this city, but here concluded
that she would remain, principally be
cause she found eood friends in the Sal
vationists, who said they would try to
locate her parents. In the meantime em
ployment was procured for Miss Jensen at
the Esraeralda vineyard, east of town, in
the home of the superintendent, George
Goemhimer. The woman was a faithful
servant, but began to pine to return to her
parents.
To-day while Goemhimer was at church
with his family Miss Jensen decamped.
When the superintendent returned home
he first found the woman's hair, which
had been somewhat irregularly cut, lying
on the floor. Upon further investigation
Goemhimer found that a hat and a suit of
his clothing were gone, besides a pair of
blankets. It is supposed that the woman
has set out a^aia to make her way to
Texas, in onler to return to her parents.
SECRETARY M'CABE'S NEW PLACE.
Pleased With His Transfar to the State
Library Because It Will Enabh
H m to Study.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 4.â ln an
interview accorded a Call representative
this evening K. D. McCabe, private secre
tary to Governor Budd, said:
"I suppose it is useless to attempt to
conceal tnat certain changes in State offi
cers are contemplated. As for myself, I
expect to assume the duties of State
Librariau on the first of the coming
month. It is a position which I have long
aspired to, not altogether from personal
motives whereby I might be financially
benefited, but because it will give me a
grand opportunity to further perfect my
self in tne study of my chosen profession,
the law. Ever since 1 have held the posi
tion of private secretary I nava felt that I
was to a certain extent neglecting my ob
ject in life, or rather that I could not de
vote the requisite time to reading and
study necessary to keep abreast with the
times in the legal line nnd susiain the
duties of the office I filled. In conse
quence I was anxious for a chance and I
1.-cl that the position of State Librarian,
wnere I will have constant access to one
of tne beat law libraries in the United
States, will place me in a position to at
tain my sole amhition in life â prominence
in the legal profession."
SCORED BY SACRAMENTO LABOR.
Governor Budd, the Examiner and tbo
Chronicle Rebuked by Union
Workirgmen.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 4. â The
various labor unions of this city have
unanimously adopted a set of resolutions
in which they severely arraign Governor
Budd for bis action in vetoing the appro
priation for the State printing office, and
ihe members personally unite in denounc
ing the Examiner and Chronicle for the
stan d they have assumed. The resolution
as adopted by the Sacramento Typographi
cal Union is in part as follows:
Whereas, Sacramento Typographical Union
No. 40, branch of the International Typo
graphical Union ol North America, and a'tiili
ated with the American Federation ot Labor,
bt-ing obligt-d to losier the interests of its
members and to protect them against the as
saults of fr-es wnerever found, convenes in
special session to-day to protest against the
concerted action of Governor Budd uud the
San Francisco Chronicle ana Examiner iv
their efforts to annihilate the State priuting
office of California.
Sacramento typographical union and all
slsier unions stand for tho maintenance o
that institution. They take that stand be
cause it is one of the bin works of organized
labor in California and its lail would be a
severe blow to union wage-earners. Union
printers have received some setbacks of Into.
chief Hinimu them being the introduction and
successful operation of typesetting machines.
Agaiust the ingenuity of man we may not de
mur, but when a public officer in high, station
throws :he great weight oi his office into the
balance against the interest of organized
labor, then ii is our privilege, as it is our duty,
to make our grievances known.
The Governor of California has elected to
alien himself wim our business. Tois angry
man, made ilizzy by the height to which labor
elevated him, now turns his back to tabor;
this angry man having a quarrel with one
union prluter, seeks to revenge himself upon
all union printers.
The union knows nothing of the personal
difficulties existing between Governor Budd
M n>i the Hon. A. J. Johnston, State I'nnter.
We know that A. J. Johnston is our friend and
the friend of organized labor everywhere. He
nas shown it by his deeds, not by his profes
sions, and by bit deeds shall he be known. He
has hired none but union men, and has re
peatedly declared that if he could not employ
union labor ho would not employ any. II â¢
lias paid good wages and has doggedly set his
face agunst conutless proposed reductions.
He has been the unswerving friend of lnbor Â«t
all times, in season and out, and 88 such he
will be gratefully remembered when his de
tractors have "molded iv forgotten graves."
On the other hand wo have James 11. Budd.
a man who preacnes much good and practices
much evil. His administration, so far as labor
is concerned â and in that are we mostly con
cernedâhas been one long earn: v.il of deceit,
and in his last ana greatest crime ngainst
labor â the attempt to close the State Printing
Officeâ he becomes the star in hypocrisy's mas
querade; * curing the guise of a benefactor lie
fcmiles in the face of labor nnd sticks a knit j
in its rib-. He performs an act (by vetoing the
State Printing Office appropriation) which
throws hundred people out of work,
and then declares it to be a "good thing."
This union denies that the closing of the
State Printing unite will be a good thing, not
withstanding the fact that Governor Budd and
the San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner
have so published to the people of this State.
This State requires a certain amount of print
ing work that must be done, and it can be
done as cneaply and as well in the State office
as under the contrai-t system. The contract
system would cost just as much, but the money
would be differently distributed. Most of it
would go to tne contractors and very little to
the laborers.
The resolution adopted by the Printing
Pressmen's Union No. 60 elso strongly de
nounces the action taken by the Governor,
claiming that it originated from prejudice
and personal grievance, and was p* rsisted
in despite a full investigation carried out
by a legislative committee and aided by
non-partisan experts, which resulted in a
complete vindication from the charges he
had preferred. Its resolution says:
The Governor, in bis machanitions, has bean
aided by the San Francisco Examiner, from
which paper, being the Governor's mouth
piece, we could expect nothing, nor from the
San Francisco chronicle, noted for its animus
against the State Priming Office from Us in
ception and the uniform opposition to the
BtatÂ« system of text-book. While metropolitan
papers should be exponents of honest opinion
in the interest of the who:e people, too oittm
they are but agents of corruption for their
own gain. We cannot but Infer ihat the pa
pers mentioned are Darties to the great con
spiracy to overthrow the State system of tex^
books, destroy t ho institution in which they
are produced and defeat the will of the people.
Similar resolutions were adopted by the
bookbinders' union.

TRIBUTE PAID TO
DEAD ASSASSINS
Pretentious Funeral of the
Borrego Murderers at
Santa Fe.
Immens? Throng Follows the
Bodies of the Four to
the Grave.
Friends of the Departed Cutthroats
Admit That FraDk Borrego
Killed Chavez
SANTA FE, N. Mex., April 4.â The
funeral of the four Borrego assassins was
held at 7 o'clock in tne cathedral, and the
promise of tne dead men's friends that it
would be a demonstration calculated to
impress the people that the men were un
justly hanged â at least three of themâ was
verified. Never before in Santa Fe's mor
tuary history cad such a large number of
people attended the last services to the
dead, which partook in a great measure of
a political character.
The cathedra! was jammed with people,
and at the close of the services the pro
cession that followed the bodies to the
grave was the most pretentious ever wit
nessed here. To-morrow at 7 o'clock a re
quiem will be sung.
Among those who attended the funeral
was Jose Borrego, a young brother of two of
the deceased, who is serving a two years'
sentence in the penitentiary for assault
with intent to kill. Governor Thornton
granted him permission to go under quad.
It is admitted now, even by their friends,
that Frank Borrego killed ex-Sheriff Cha
vez, aided by Hippolite Vigil, Chief of
Police, who was subsequently killed by
tne Sheriff's posse, but the other three,
they claim, died martyrs.

Mormonism is said to be gaining ground

has been the custom of the Mormons to

position, and it is probable they will have
to look elsewhere for meeting-places. The
elimination ol polygamy, so far from kill
ing Mormonism, seems to have made it
more acceptable to the general run of
people, and among the more ignorant
classes of the East it may yet spread to
great proportions and acquire consider
able strength.
IN THE SENATE.
The political interest of the country
this week will be centered in the Senate,
and the people will be very much disap
pointed if some active steps are not taken
there to make progress in dealing with
the tariff bill. The situation in the Senate
is known to be complicated, but it is not
too much to expect that in a matter of
such importance as the new tariff some
agreement can be reached among the
wiser and more patriotic members by
which action on that measure may be
expedited.
There has been trouble all along over
the organization of the Senate committees.
The Democrats bare claimed that the
committees shall be composed of members
of the various parties in the some ratio as
in the last session. They have further
claimed that silver Republicans shall be
counted as regular Republicans in assign
ing to that party its proportional repre
sentation on each committee. To this
there has been some objection on the
Republican side and as a consequence a
deadlock prevails.
Last week the Republicans appointed a
committee on committees to deal with the
subject. This was the first step toward
the solution ot the deadlock. Tht next
and final steps will probably be soon
taken. Most of the silver Republicans are
known to be favorable to the tariff. They
are as stanch protectionists as McKinley
himself, and on that irsue can be counted
on to act with the party and the adm nis
tration. Moreover, leading Democrats
have asserted th?y would make no merely
obstructive right apa.nst t tie bill. The
outlook therefore for some action on the
measure this week is eood. We may
expect the Finance Committee to go far
toward getting the bill ready to report, at
an early date.
One reason why we may with confidence
expect prompt wcrk on the measure is
that it is an old and much discussed ques
tion with which most of the leaders of the
Senate are thoroughly familiar. They
have been discussing tariff rates and
schedules for the last ten years. They
have taken part in framing the McKinley
tariff and the Wilson tariff. They are
well posted on the needs of our industries
and on the best means of raising the
revenue required for the Government. In
addition to this the Republican leaders
were undoubtedly consulted to some ex
tent in making the Dingley tariff. It is
clear therefore that ti.ey ought to be able
to act upon it without any gieut delay at
this time.
The House of Representatives showed
its recognition of the importance of
speedy action by enacting that the bill
should go into effect on April 1. This
example will not be lost on the Senate.
As Dalzell said in the House, "Oratory
will not open a single mill nor kindle a
single furnace tire." Action is what is
wanted.
A LITTLE BXUPFED RABBIT.
The proprietors of the kinetoscope
which took pictures of tlie Carson prize
fight made a little stuffed rabbit last Sat
urday night and eet him out in the road
way. He was an innocent-looking little
rabbit and fatâ delicioualy fat. The jokers
chuckled in their bear Is as they left him
and went and hid themselves in the woods
to watch the result.
Boa-constrictor Hearst, faring that way
with bis keenest olfactory sniffer in the
air, came around a bend in the road and
piused, entranced. Tne little fat rabbit
was his â ail his. Gliding up, without a
sound, he swallowed it at a gulp. This is
what thereupon issued out of Boa-con
strictor Hearst's two flaming eyesâ or, at
least, out of the long greea eye in the
West:
NEW YORK, N. V., April 3.â lf the state
ments made by E. J. Rector be true, there is a
dark futureâ or, rather, no futureâ ahead for
the kinetoscope views of the recent iistic en
counter in Carson, Nev. And that means a
great deal to those who "paid the freight" for
that photographic enterprise.
Rector avers that he is not worried about
the prospect of legislation that will cripple
the business of giving profitable exhibitions
of the prize-fight. No; that, jo he says, is a
minor consideration. It is the knowledge that
the views taken at the ringside are dismal
failures that is giving him the uightmaro.
A whole lot more of the little rabbit
crops out in the course of a column dis
patch published in double-leaded type on
the front page of yesterday's long grsen
â¢ye. It was a special rabbit, you see, spe
cially stuffed and copyrighted for only one
tnake; wherafore much had to be made of
it. Here is another rare bit, following a
reference to the fact that several Btate
Legislatures are planning to prevent the
exhibition of prize-fight views in public:
But this legislative handicap does not worry
Rector. In fact, he says ho is laughing In his
sleeve at the misguided legislators. He tninks
It a great joke that co much space in the stat
ute-books should be used to prohibit some
thing that is impossible of accomplishment.
Palpably Mr. Hector, by getting before
the public the idea that he is amused at
the Legislatures because of a needlees pre
caution which they are taking, hopes to
throw the Legislatures off their guard and
cause them to drop those "needless" pre
cautions which make them so painfully
ridiculous in his sight. The announce
ment that the views are hopelesaly spoiled
is calculated to stop all legislation against
them. "What is the use of all this fight
against us when we can't go on anyhow?"
asks the little white rabbit. Why, indeed ?
It is a most plausible proposition. Why
don't the Legislatures lay down their arms
forthwith and turn their valuable atten
tion to something else? Never mind Mr.
Rector. Just leave him by nuuseif to sor
row over nil spoiled pictures. Don't
bother to keep an eye on him. He him
self says that it would be absurd to do so
hereafter. Let him alone and forget all
about the kinetoscopeâ until, long after
the Legislatures have relaxed their opposi
tion to it, it suddenly appears upon our
streets in full blast! That it will actually
do that latter thing is merely it possibility,
of course, it being only possible that Mr.
Rector, when relieved ot the legislative
proceedings which uo humorously diverted
him from his work, may discover that the
blemishes on his views were not so serious
as the persistence of t< c legislative fight
against him at first led him to suppose.
THE POULTBY INDUSTRY.
The importance of the poultry industry
of thw United States, and the benefits
to be attained by extending it, are
well illustrated in a digest maue by the
Rural Press of an address recently de
livered by Samuel Cushman of Rhode
Island at a farmers' meeting in Boston.
The information given is not new, but it
is worth repeating, and particularly to
Californijms, for it makes clear the possi
bilities wpicb lie before our farmers when
they have turned their attention to the in
dustry.
The magnitude of the interest at present
is made evident by the report of the cen
sus of 1890, which showed that the value
of the poultry products of the country ex
ceeded that of cotton or bogs. In fact its
money value was hardly inferior to that
of the wheat crop. While we produced,
however, more cotton, hogs and wheat
than our people could consume, we diJ
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 5, 1897.
not produce enough eggs for home con
sumption.
According to the statements of Mr.
Cusbman, while a few thousand dozens of
eggs are exported annually millions of
dozens are imported. During the past
three yean about $1,000 000 worth of for
eign eggs have been brought into this
couritry. These eges come from Canada,
China, Japan and Mexico. Europe has
rione to sell. Her supply is not equal to
her demand. England and Germany do
not produce 60 per cent of the ecgj they
consume, and the consumption would be
greater if the supply permitted it.
It is noted that the industry in this
country is growiug rapidly. In 1880 there
were 126.000,000 fowls kept. In 1890 these
had increased to 286,000.000. In 1896 it is
estimated there were 383,000,000. Most of
these were common stock, and not so
profitable as the finer breeds. An im
provement of the stock, however, is stead
ily going on. Our farmers are beginning
to understand the profits of the industry
and the advantage of good breeds.
California ought to be one of the lead
ing Slates of the Union in this industry
and have eggo to sell, bat unfortunately
it does not produce enough for its own
consumption. Perhaps we shall improve
in this respect along with the rest of the
Union. There is certainly room for it.
la this connection it is worth noting the
Dingley tariff puts a protective duty of 5
cents a dozen on imported eggs. That
wiil ?erve to aid the American farmei in
competing with Mexico, China and Japan.
The chances, therefore, for developing the
industry may be considered good, and
there is hardly any kind of ranch in Cali
fornia where it could not be undertaken
with advantage to a greater or less extent.
COME TO OALirOBNIA-
The New York society correspondent of
The Call opened her weekly letter yester
day with the query, "Where are you going
this summer?" The question is quoted
as merely tho refrain of what society folk
in Gotham are asking one another on all
aides at this particular stage of the season.
The annual travelers of other Eastern
cities are, of course, undergoing the same
grave suspense, anent their own impend
ing migrations. The Call, stepping for
ward and lifting its hat, is charmed that
it so opportunely overheard this brow
wrinkling exchange of conundrums. It
affords us infinite pleasure to be of ser
vice to les messieurs and ies mesdamss of
the unfortunate East, which lacks so sadly
in furnishing means for their enjoy
ment and comfort.
While ice floats in large chunks upon its
river* and snow covers its bills and chokes
its valleys, and all the air is laden with
cold and sleet and ravaging winds; while
its towns are being either blown into the
air by cyclones or sunk beneath the water
from overflowing rivers; while everything
in nature is at war around and about
it, and the lives of its inhabitants are im
periled by possible disasters and made
miserable by present afflictionsâ while all
these handicaps to hospitality are pre
venting the East from affording suit
able pleasure to pleasure-loving people,
The Call steps forward to offer California,
the , peerless, the ideal haven when all
other localities fail, as a stage for the peo
ple of the East to come and tread for en-
joyment.
Here are all the natural blessings In the
world. They hare been gone over in de
tail sufficiently often to preclude any need
for repetition here. Suffice it to say that
the coming Cnriitian Endeavor excur
sions vttl afford an unusually inviting
opportunity to come to the Golden State
and revel in the riches which only the
Goideu State can show.

The Healdsburg Tribune thinks "there is

a matter of course. The lack of a reason for a
town's somnolence does not constitute in it
self an evidence that the town will not be som
nolent. Those things go contrary to reason
and are generally governed by the disposition
of the inhabitants, all material factors being
equal. And human disposition, you know, is
variable. Healdsburg is likely to make a spurt
all in a twinkiing and undergo a regular boom
of progressive enterprise on the part of its
people. Where the spirit Is anxious and the
materials are at hand success Is certain to
follow.
NEWS OF FORtiiGN NAVIES
The coal consumption at recent trials of
British navy ships is remarkably low, due,
probably, to the auperior quality of fuel. The
Doris during her thirty hours' trial kept up a
spaed of ltili Knots and used 1.47 pounds of
coal per liar epower per hour, while a sister
ship, the Juno, expanded 1.64 pounds to keep
up the same speed.
Eight vessels are in course of construction
for the German navy. Of these, two armor
clad*, the Kaiser Frtedrich 111 and Kriedrich
derGrosse.arc completing at Wilhelmshafen.
An armored cruiser, the Lelpsic, is bulldinf at
Kiel, two second-class cruisers at Dantzic, two
second-class cruisers at the Vulcan Irou
Works, Stettin, and one second-class cruiser at
Bremerhaten.
During the thirty hours' consumption trial
the Powerful, British trniser of 14.200 tons,
consumed 453 tons of coal and maintained an
average ipeed Â©I : 20.95 knot* with 18,459
horsepower. With 3000 tons of coal In her
bunkers the Powerful and the Terrible could
m> ko the trip from England to the United
States In six days and have 830 tons of coal
left in her bunkers.
Thirty engine-room mechanics in the British
navy wili be selected during the present year
for warrant rank, the time of service for such
promotion having been settled at sixteen
years. It is many years since this proposition
was first aeitated by civilians and navy offi
cers and now that England has Introduced the
system its adoption in the United States navy
should not be unnecessarily delayed as it will
attract to the navy and keep in it a class of
men whose services are now not recognized

The Canopus, battleship of 12.050 tons,
building at Portsmouth, is making rapid
progress. The keel was laid January 4 last,
and 1280 tous had already been worked into
the hull ud lo March 14. Part ol the f-ames
are up to the upper dec* and the protection
deck is nearly completed. The total weight
of hull, inciuding armor and armor-backing,
is sii'iO tons, hence nearly one-seventh of the
material has been worked in placa in ten
weeks and the ship will undoubtedly ba floated
as intended during the present year. She in
to be rtady for sea in twenty months from tho
time of beginning.
Yarrow, the well-known torpedo-boat
builder, carried on a series of interesting trials
during the first half of March with a view of
ascertaining the effect of using salt water in
the boiler. The experiment, which extended
from eight to ten hours each aay fÂ«r five con
secutive days, demonstrated the fact that with
salt water in the boiler three-quarter speed
might be kept up. The boiler selected was of
the "express" type with straight tubes oniy
ofie inch in diameter ana there was no incrus
tation to check the frea flow of water nor waÃ
there any priming. The trial was instructive
in that it showed what could be done iv case
of emergency.
The propellers of the Powerful and Terrible
are of 19 feet (j inches diameter and 24 feet
pitch. Both are made of phoshor bronze and
that of the Terrible is polished. Tne surfaces
of the two ships' screws Is 73 square feet for
the Poweriul and 02 square leet for the Ter
rible. The recent trials developed some singu
lar results, the slip being 13.7 per cent for the
Powerful and 14.5 per cent for the Terrible, both
being under 18,000 torsepower. At the 25,000
horsepower trial the excess of the slip changed
about and recorded 18 5 per cent for the
Powerful and only 15.2 per cent for the other
â¢hip.

Fresh reports of disturbances in the Euro
pean concert continue to come. It seems to be
as badly crippled as the recent operatic troupe
in this city. Two of the principal performers
refuse to play any longer if ihe concert is to
follow the lines of tne original programme,
and they have served notice to that effect.
Stirred by the recent letter of Mr. Gladstone,
which has all the dignity and vizor of the old
prophet!, and fearing the rapid growth of
popular sentiment among the people against
the Turk and in favor of brave little Greece,
Lord Salisbury has given notice that Great
Britain will not join in the blockado of Greece.
Iv consequence of this refusal Germany has
given notice of its intentions also to withdraw
from the concert.â Chicago Tribune.

ENGLaNu TO-DAY.
London Trutb.
England to-day is what Carthage was in
times of old. We are rulad by a hungry,
greedy aristocracy, which, in its turn, is ruled
by loan mongers and by company monrers.
Honor and honesty under this regime are de
rided as old-fashioned â â -tpersUtions. The
Minister who can sieal any territory whose in
habitants are too weak to resist us is pro
claimed as a hero. The company promoter
who can build a palace by appropriating the
savings of his lelluw-countrymen is worshiped
asadiviniiy. When we mow down Africans
with our Mi*x;:ns we glory in this proof of our
bravery. When, at the bidding of kings and
emperors, we shell Europeans struggling to
free themselves irom the suzerainty ol some
wretch who claims their allegiance, we glory
in our ehame. And while we swagger an'i
boast of our might, we are in such abject fear
of being attacked that we heap up armaments
ou armaments, because, no matter what we
spend, we still would spend more to mako us
secure.

Washington Post.
Dr. Manchester, pastor of Mr. McKinley's
church iv Canton, lella a good story concern
ing a reverend gentleman who came to Camon
"simply to pay his respects to the President
elect." ''I am not an applicant for office,"
suia the visitor to the major when the latter
received him in hig library, "I have ca led
simply for the purpose of congratulating you
upon your emciion."
Dr. Manchester referred to this little epi
sode while talking to a party of friends,
among whom whs Mr. McKinley, as Illustrat
ing that tnere were a few men who called at
the M< Kinley home and were not applicants
for office.
"Hold on," said the President when Dr.
Manchester had concluded, ''you did not hear
the end of our conversation. Your friend took
me over in the corner and whispered that
while he did not want a position lor himself,
he would like me to take care of his boy. "
EFFECTS OF BRif Ibtt POLICY.
Toronto Mall and Empire.
If Britain were not bound to a cast-iron free
trade policy, she would now command great
privileges in the United States as ;hu price of
the market sue affords American farmers.
Not only has Britain's policy emboldened
other countries to tax her products out of
their market, but under the high duties to
which they have safely resorted iheir indus
tries have grown into strength to compete
with Britain's industries, even in the home
market. Germany's competition is formidable
everywnere, and that oi the United States is
becoming vigorous. Pig iron, steel, steel rails
and woolen poods are now bein<j shipped from
the United Stutes into the Bri'ish market.

were flying so thick and fast on all the

NOTES OF THE
NATIONAL GUARD
The Appropriations That
Will Be Used for the
Soldiers.
There Will Certainly Be Mili
tary Instruction in Camp
This Year.
The Naval Battalion Will Have an
Opportunity to Go to S?a in
the Ironclad Comacke*
There is joy in the ranks of the Na
tional Guardsmen now because the Gov
ernor has signed the appropriation bill,
which will enable them to go into catup
this year.
ttio bill which he has signed grants
about everything that the guardsmen
hare asked for, and it provides in addition
to the usual amount for the expense of
the Adjutant-General's office the following
amounts: For armory rent 3 and other
expenses of the Guard, $156,600; allowance
division headquarters, $1200; purchase
of uniforms, $32,000; coal and other
supplies of training-ship Comanche,
$5000; allowance for' brigade head
quarters, $6816; target practice and
purchase of medals, $8000; for hospital
supplie?. three brigades, $3000; for travel
ing expenses of officers on detail duty
$4000 ; for armory rents and other expenses
for one additional company, $2000 ; amount
allowance for one additional company,
$500; uniforms for aame, $480; for armory
rents and other expenses of one additional
company of the national reserve, $1600;
annual allowance of the Natlonnl Guard,
$30,466 32; allowance for regimental head
quarters, intluding allowance for bands,
$11,800; for encampments for the forty
ninth fiscal year which commences next
July, $30,000.
Adjutant-General Barrett was in the City
last Saturday, and when spoken to on the sub
ject of camps he stated that he was in favor of
ref imeutal camp?. In the Second Brigade the
majority of the officers la the First and Fi t h
regiments are In favor of regimental camps
and not In favor of a division encampment.
They are of the opinion that regimental campi
will be productive of far better results than a
division camp would. The men themselves in
this City are stronply in favor of a regimental
camp, but that is a matter that rests with the
commander-in-chief, who may rrder an en
campment for discipline and drill either by
division, brigade, regiment, battalion or unat
tached company. When so ordered out lor
not less than seven dayr. encb company shall
receive a sum equal to $1 25 per day for each
officer and man regularly on duty in camp,
provided the aggregate 6hall not exceed $400
per company. Ail mounted officers and men
shall be allowed $2 per day for each hcise
used by them in me encampment.
The new law that will hereafter govern the
National Guard of this State includes a num
ber of new features, but none that will work
any radical changes.
The Second Brigade.
The men la this City are awaiting the time
when Colonel Jamea F. Smith will aisume
command of the First Regiment, as they are
somewhat anxious to learn what changes, if
any, will take place. There li a great deal of
talk about possible changes, despite the asser
tion of the new colonel that he -will not make
any. There are "knowing ones" who *ay that
there aia a number of resignations all ready
to be tendered ax soon as Colunel Smith shall
make the announcement, that he has taken
command.
These reports involve the lieutenant-colonel
of the regiment. It is stated that a strong
effort will be made to induce him to remain
with the regiment should be have it in his
mind to retire. The lieutenant-colonel still
declines to either affirm or deny ihe report
â¢bout his intention to resign.
The several companies at the armories con
tinue their drills every week. Next Wednes
day the Second Battalion of the First Infantry
will give a drill at the armory, and the event
will be followed by a dance, i
Arrangements, so officers of this brigade
have been advised, ore being perfected at the I
adjutant-general's office for the inspection to
be held in the near future. Orders will prob
ably be issued this week. Arrangements are
also being made to the end that the men may
engage in target practice under the new regu
lations.
Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 2.â At a meeting
of the officers of Company G several nights
since, the advisability of going to San Fran
cisco on May 3 was discussed.
The carnival committee has flared the Third
Regiment transportation, and Company G
would like to accept were it not for the fact
that the month of May is a hard month in
which to get away. It was decided to ascer
tain whether the encampment appropriation
would meet with the approval of the Governor,
before the proposition would be considered by
the company individually. .
Brifcidier-General Muller is anxious to get
the brigade together, as he has never had all
the companies together at one time, and it Is
not improbable that he may call them together
upon this occasion. -
One of the reasons, in addition to saving the
expense, i* to demonstrate the fact that the
plan is feasible, so that future Legislatures
may see their way clear to pay the men for the
time they lose in going into camp and making
camp life more a matter of military business
than a picnic. The company would like to
hear from other companies throughout tha I
State in regard to this plan. â¢â¢â 
The company will begin shooting for com
pany medals in the three classes this month,
shooting once a month until November.
Within two weeks the company will hold a
team shoot, each lieutenant choosing fifteen
men, the losers to pay for a smoker. â¢<
\VhÂ«sn the company goes into camp it has
decided to bar all substitutes, and an outsider

The appropriation bill signed by the Gover
nor will give the Naval Battalion at this point
an opportunity to make arrangements for a
little more than stationary work with the
Cotnanrha. The amended National Guard
law will give the naval people an additional
company, which will allow them â  to organize

SOCIETY was the theme of a thought
ful sermon by the Rev. J. Stephens of
the Simpson Memorial Church Sun
day evening. A portion of his remarks
was aa follows:
"Society is a very extensive term. We
confine itjo-night to that branch of the
social life of humanity which pertains to
pleasure? and amusements. Social inter
course was divinely ordained, and the
happiness that flows from a legitimate in
dulgence in it is a moral power which no
church should condemn. The society for
a Christian must be a Christian society,
and the drawing-room ought to be, in a
sense, as sacred as t!;e church. We say
nothing against society or social life ex
cept in so far as its spirit and its practices
are un-Christian. The Scriptures condemn
the sociey of the ungodly, the sinner and
the scornful. The best society is that in
which thess elements are wanting. Soci
ety ought Â»o be 'exclusive' in the matter
of banishing such people from its circles.
The most pernicious thing about society
is that it persists in calling and thinking
that the best and highest which freely ad
mits such characters, drawing the" line
only at poverty or humble birth. Prob
ably in no other sphere of life is there a
more urgent need for the application of
the principles of the Xazarene than in our
social affairs."
"Ye Will Not Come,"
Said the Master.
THE Rev. W. A. Gardner of the West
Side Christian Church preached last
night on the problem of why theie
are so few conversions. He said:
"Of the many thousands of adults who
annually die ia the United States only a
few are converted Christians. In Sau
Francisco there are about 100 Protestant
ministers and eighty Protestant churches,
surported at a weekly cost of at least $2000,
and yet it is not a very rare thing for all
these ministers and churches to labor a
week without converting one sinner.
"One of the greatest problems consid
ered by present-day Christisns is why the
number of the converted are so few. Much
of the theology of the past has been such
as to cast the blame upon God, it having
been taueht in creed and from the pulpit
that conversion was us much a miracle as
creation, and that God had the love to
convert the most hardened sinner ii he
chose to do so.
"Our text, 'Ye will not come to me that
ye might have hie,' is a sinsle, etraisht
forward sentence, and answers the ouex
tion "Why are there so few conversions?'
"Man, with an accusing conscience, has
made a thousand excuses ior his irrelig
ious life, but these are all swept away by
the Master's 'Ye will not.' Conversion is
a radical thine; it is a 'K'pH aboui face'
in living. It is a cbon^e of lif> â a change
of character. You have been going on the
down grade of bin â you turn about and
travel on the upward grade of righteous
ness. Men are doing hard things and
making radical changes in the realm of
politics and finance to secure earthly
prize; why not in tho spiritual realm to
secure a crown of eternal life?"
The Atonement
Satisfied the Law.
A sermon on the subject of the atone
ment was delivered yesterday morn
ing at St. Paul's German Lutheran
Church by the pastor, J. M. Buehler.
Alter alluding to the fact that the hu
man race ha 3 ever in the most solemn
manner by its religious rites and cere
monies recognized the necessity of an
atonement for bin, the pastor offered an
explanation for this fact in stating the
reasons lrom which, in all probability, It
had arisen. He declared that man is by
the very nature of his moral being con
scious of the truth that sin must bring
the punishment of offended holiness and
justice upon the sinner, that therefore
something must be done to avert this
punishment and to regain the lost favor
of God.
Tne pastor presented in his theme the
absolute assurance with which we may
depend on the atonement made for us by
Christ, showing first tbÂ« evidence on
which this assurance rests, and secondly
the happy effects that this assurance
should produce. TbÂ» evidence was that
Christ came by God's own will and ap
pointment as the anointed hitru priest of
the worid; that he in his twofold nature
possessed the personal qualifications for
this work- ; that by his fulfillment of God's
immutable law in its requirements and its
penailies he complied with every demand
of divine justice, end thu- made a full
and perfect atonement for sin.
Thorns Sprang Up
and Choked It.
RECTOR M. D. WILSOK of St. Peters
Episcopal CLureti preached Sunday
morning from the text, Luke viii, 7
nnd 14, "The thorns sprang up and choked
it * * * and it brought no fru.t to per
fection." He said:
"The thorns are present witn us, all the
things which tend to retard the life of the
tsoul. The life of the individual is the in
tegral part of the life of the State. Where
individual lives are pure and true and
worshipful ana disciplined, then life of
the Bt?.te is safe. Wiiere individual lives
yield to the thorns and allow them to con
quer, then the liie of the S'.ate is In
dancer.
"One of thÂ« daneera of our California
life to-day lies iv the thorns of the undis
ciplined lives of so many of our boys and
girls who will so boon be our men and
women. This lack oi discipline shows it
self in many ways; among others, in the
absence from the worship of God, in the
disrespect to parents, in the reckless use
of firearms. The root of the matter is al
lowing the thorn of discipline to choke
ont the Rood seed of the word of God;
and the people seem to love to have n o.
And what will we do in the end thereof?"
Love for Enemies
Is Not Impossible.
LOVE your enemies was the theme
preached upon by the Rev. J. S.
David of the Swedenborg Mission
Society at Washington Hall yesterday
morning. In the course of Li-s remarks
he !-aid : \
"Two prominent agnostics, and I know
not now many more, have repeatedly oe
clared that when Jesua enjoined his disci
pies to love their enemies He gave a com
mand tuat no man ever did or ever can

obey. Their position betrays a Jow ideal
of love, a low conception of purity. If I
love my neighbor simply because he loves
me or does not hate me, Ido not really
love him ; I only love myself through him.
Ii 1 io^e him not for my sake but for his
fake, then is my love genuine. L,ove is a
principle; it in not passion. It is more
than personul attachment; it is a living,
practical, acting principle. It seeks the
well-being of all, regardless of their per
sonal prejudices. It penetrates beneath
the outward aversion and recognizes the
germs of good and the possibility of their
development and loves that potential
go >d. He who cannot do this has not
reached the level of true manhood."
TROOPS AT THE PRESIDIO.
Report That Additional Ccm-
panics Will Be Sent to
That Post.
The Post Fied Day Next Wednesday.
The "Pride of Company G M Wi'l
Make His Last Appearance.
There has been considerable speculation
as to what will be done with Colonel Shat
ter, commanding the post at the Presidio,
who a short time since was granted leave
Sergeant Puckett, the Pride of
Company G.
of absence for one month. He is in line
of promotion, and in view of the retire
ment of Major-General Ruger he will be
advanced, as the retirement of the mÂ» jor
seneral will cause advancement all along
the line. The probabilities are that
Colonel fcjhafter will be commissioned a
brigadier-general and that he will then be
assigned to one of the departments, possi
bly the Department of the Columbia.
Bboold that prove to be correct then the
post at the Presidio will go to the ranking
colonel, who is Henry C. Cook, colonel
of tha Fourth Infantry.
The grading of the territory north of the old
parade-ground at the Presidio, which has been
going on for some time, has given rise to a
great deal of goÂ«*ip. The question that has
often been asked i.-, "Why does the Govern
ment want such a large parade-ground as it
will be when the new ground is added to the
old, which will be done as Â»oon bp the grade on
the eastern end of the old ground shall have
been completed. if only a drzen companiesare
to be kept at the post?" There are some who
say that this is being done to accommodate a
larger number o! men, and that it Is the inten
tion of the department lo have a full regiment
of cavalry at the post us well as two regi
ments of infantry. It has even been men
tioned that the Twenty-fourth Infantry is to
be ordered to the pout. Whatever the purpose
of the Government is in having the extensive
improvements made at the post. It in true that
it will bean immense parade-ground for the
few companies there now.
It is sa;d to be the purpose of the War De
partment J,o concentrate the bulk of the
troops now in the Siate at one central point,
and tnat point is the Presidio. It is urged
that there is no necensity for maintaining
troops at Angel l^lnnd or the Benicia bar
raoks, but these cannot be brought hera for
the reason that there ;s no accommodation
for them, and there is no appropriation for
building any. The Representatives from Cal
ifornia have on many occasions had their at
tention dr*wn to this matter, but they nave
not pressed for money for t dditiontl quarters.
It is almost certain tnat if the money was pro
vided for the purpose a post would be estab
lished at the new fortification* beyond Fort
Winfield Scott. One will have to be estab
lished there eventually, for the distance is too
far from the PrcÃidio.
Next Wednesday there will be held at the
Presidio the post field day, the last one before
the grand tournament, which is to laÂ«t sev
eral days. There will be a numb-rot inter
esting events that will no doubt attract a great
number of people 5o the pest.
Among those who will participate in this
event will be R. Pucket;, "the Pre
sidio sprinter and the pride of Company G,
First Infantry." He will run his laÂ«t 100
--yard race, for after that he will be debarred in
tnat class ot events here. Puckett i* the lirsi
soldier at the Presidio to receive a medal for
athletic events and the only one in the de-
I'Brtment of California to receive .a silver
medal for sprinting. The sergeant won three
races, with a great handicap in each. One was
four yards in n 100, five yards in U2O and fif
teen in 440. yet he won each. For his efforts
lie was given a special silver medal, which
was i>res--nied to him by Lieutenant Roudiez
last Wednesday. The sergeant is entitled to
iitiileiie honor*, having won more than twenty
first prizes, and being the only one who ha*
not been beaten in some event on past field
days at the post.
Tue quartermaster's department has adver
tised lor bids for forxgn and strew for the
several posts of the department. Bids arc
also called for for a new forage storehouse at
thÂ«* i'residm.
The new brick barracks at the Presidio are
fast approaching completion and it is prob
alile that they will be ready for occupancy be
fore the close of the month. They have been
built after the most approved models, and
will, when finished, be the most comfortable
to be found at any post.
Sinn 1* a Soul.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson lectured last even
ing before the Tbeosophical Society at the
Academy of Sciences, on the subject, "Has
Man a Soul?" In the first sentence of his lec
ture lie answered the question by haying man
is a Â»oul. The body is not the man; the body
U made up of physical matter in the process
of evolution like other matter, conscious like
other matter, nnd having the soul that matter
has, but the one human soul that each man
iii*.- is that man.
He went on to show that the human soul is
a distinct entity, a unit of cousciousnes*
capable, as aotlilug in the vegetable or miu
e:al kingdom is, of saying: "I am I," and
that this was proof that it is a unit.

Extensive Alterations to Be Made at

There will be many alterations made
out at Trinity Methodist Episcopal
Church through the rood offices of the
Church Extension Society, which haÂ«
done ao much for struggling churches of
this City. The property now belongs to
the church itself. Before long & complete
transformation will have taken place.
Naturally the pastor, Rev. Dr. F. F.
Jewell, is very enthusiastic about the new
plan, and the congregation follows suit,
for the church as it now suands is rather
small and "s'.uffy." The Sunday-school
rooms are particularly so.

holding special meetings at the church,

LORING CLUB CONCERT.
Brilliant Programme Prepared for Next
Tuesday Evening;.
The concert of the Loring Club an
nounced for the evening of Tuesday, April
â¢', promises to be one of the mo3t interest
ing concerts which that club has given for
some considerable time.
The principal composition, on the pro
gramme is a setting of Kingsley'a "Long
beards' Saga," by C. Harford Lloyd, an
English composer of the front rank. This
la written for male voice chorus and piano
accompaniment (not for orchestra), and
the work appeals not only to the musician
but to the average listener.
The programme includes Billeter's
"Sunset, for tenor solo and male-voice
chorus, and Genee's "Italian Salad," the
tenor solo in which will be sung by Frank
Coffin, while the solo, in Billeter's "Sun
set" has been assigned to Mr. Desmond.
Schubert's "The Gondoliers" is a dainty
example of the genial composer whose
centenary has lately been universally hon
ored, and an admirable contrast to this
on the present programme is Arthur
Foote'B "The Bedouin Love Song."
The club will have the assistance, as
soloist, of Mrs. Edgar J. Malmeren, who
will niase her public reappearance in the
San Francisco musical world on this oc
casion. The accompanist of the evening
will be. Mrs. Carmiccael Carr, and D. P.
Hughes, the conductor of the club, will as
usual direct the concert.
The coming concert is ths^bird of the
twentieth season, and judging from the
fact that not only is the active member
ship full, with an auxiliary list to draw
on, but that the demand for tickets for

beautiful tribute to the deceased, being a
review of his association with him in labor
foi higher education. This was concluded
with the benediction, after which the
friends present took their last look at ti 3
faco of the dead.
The interment took place at Masonic
Cemetery, the Pioneers' plat, where the
marshal read the service.
The t>aJl- bearers were: Henry Palmer,

A RELIGIOUS
FREE SCHOOL
Why the One Supported hy
the B'ne B'rith Was
Discontinued.
Movement to Re-establish It and
Maintain It by Contri
butions.
Proposition to Be Discussed in the
Temple Emanu-El To-
Niglit.
For a number of years there was main
tained in this City by the Independent
Order of B'ne B'rith a religious free
school for the education of juvenile
Israelites. It was carried on with a view
to keep in the minds of the young pupils
the religion and traditions of the Jewish
people. For a time those eligible to that
education were the children ot members
of the order, but as time wore on children
of non-members were admitted, and
toward the latter part of last year the
number of pupils reached about 230. The
school was held in one of the rooms of the
B'ne B'rith building on Eddy street, and
it was continued there for some time.
Then it was removed to one of the syna
gogues south of Market street.
The matter of educating children of
non-members was one that was frequently
brought up in tbe lod^eroom and there
were many warn? discussions, some hold
ing that the school should be conducted
on the lines on which it was first started
and others more liberal minded were of
the opinion that all children of the Jew
ish faith should receive the instruction
imparted.
At the session of the District Grand
Lodge held in Stockton last January a
coii mit tee was appointed to inquire into
the expediency of continuing tue school,
and upon the report presented it was de
cided to withdraw the support of the
lodges from the school, but this was done
with the understanding that other means
would be provided to continue tbe school.
On the 2Gth of last February fifteen
Israelites of this City metin the Temple
Emauu-El, discussed the proposition to
continue the school by voluntary contri
butions, ana a committee was named to
prepare a plan. This committee has per
fected a plan which will be presented to
a general meeting of Israelites to De held
this evening in the temple.
The committee has issased an unsigned
circular wnich his been distributed to
every prominent Israelite in this City and
in that there is the following:
The question now to be solved by the Jewish
community of this City is: How to promote
the religious education of our poor Jewish
youth.
Intrinsically a religious education is desir
able in itself; from the atandDoint of good cit
izenship it is a necessity ; whiie as Jews it is
our sacred duty to see that not one sheep
strays Jrom the flock. Nunibeness children of
parents who can by no possible means afford
to attach themselves to a congregation are to
day growing up, either in utter ignorance of
the religion and history ot their forefathers,
or else, it may be said, fed of it in so unnaiat
able a manner and by such distorted methods,
that to their young American minds, trained
in our public schools, that which should be
come an object of veneration appears to them
a travesty and by-word.
The resuit of such a condition is invariably
an army of the tcoffcrs and blasphemers, who,
perhaps siowiy, but surely, graduate into
socialists and even anarchists or swell the dis
affected classes in general. This, sir, is the
picture which we are compelled to unfold to
your view as part and parcel of our com
munity. Have we then erred in considering
you as one who would be willing to assist in
br nglng about a change?
You must not for one moment think that
the picture is overdrawn or that we are engag
ing in this work for the want of something
better to do. There is nothing better to be
done at the precent than to follow the wise
example of ail tue large Eastern and European
cities. Their experience teaches them that
tbe only sure way of rescuing the poor
unfortunate youth from moral perdition and
the Jewish name fiom disgrace, is a modern
religious education.

RIVAL THE RICH

Veteran Miners Marvel at
the Wealth of the
Yuma Mines.
Ore Worth a Dollar a Pouod
Taken From Veins Recently-
Discovered.
Prospectors S y the Picacho Mm ng
District Will B c me the Rich
est in tha U o: d.
YUMA, Ariz., April 4.â Despite the
coming of warm weather mining excite
ment in this eection is increasing daily.
Capitalists representing millions of dol
lars are coming and gome continually.
The King of Arizona, a mine the discov
ery of which a month ago has made the
town of (jleason, has been inspected by all
prominent mmmc magnates of the United
States, and is pronounced the greatest
discovery ever made in North America.
A small interest in it has been sold by the
original discoverers and owners, Gleason
and Echelbereer, to Mayor R. J. Duncan
of Yuma and Epes Randolph of Tucson,
Ariz. The price paid was very large, and
the transaction also involved the erection
by the purchase rs of costly machinery for
tne reduction of ore?. Two mills bave
been already ordered and will arrive here
next week, and more will be bought when
the mine i-s opened.
Development being done on the mine
discloses a richness never excelled in the
mining history of the world. As tbe ore
body widens the ore grows r.cher, and
mining men with great wealth and years
of experience grow excited when they
see it.
But not all the gold in this section is at
Gleason, for strikes are being made daily
in all directions. To-day word comes
from Picacho, twenty-five miles north of
Yuma. mat the strikes at Gleason had
been eclipsed In the Golden Dream and
Noonday mines. At a depth of eichty
feet ore bodies were encountered almost
simultaneously In both claims, in which
gold showed plainly at a distance of sev
eral steps. Tbe value of the rock is esti
mated at from $1000 to $3000 a ton, and the
vein is about two leet wide. The two
mines lie side by side and the strikes
made in each are probably in the same
vein.
The people of Picacho are wildly en
thusiastic and picdict that Picacho will
coon be the greatest mining camp in the
worid.
RICB.EST UK EVER SAW.
Colonel l'aynt Say* Wonderful Ore Baa
H-rn Exposed to t'i'tc.
POMOIN A, Cal.. April 4.â Colonel Daniel
E. Payne arrived from Yuma this after
nocn. He says that some finds of wonder
tol y rich grade ore has been made in the
vicinity of Yuma in the past two weeks.
Yuma is wild with the gold-mining fever.
He has been interested in mines for years,
but he says be never before knew of such
rich ore as that ne saw in the Picacho dis
trict, twenty-five miles north of Ynma, on
the California side of the Colorado River.
Ex-United States Senator Dorsey and
Jesse Grant of San Diego have been in
teresiea therefor a few years past. Rich ore
has been found there in the last few
weeks, and a vein opened on Thursday in
the Golden Dream mine 9is said to yield
ore worth $1 a pound.
"1 never saw such ore in all mv experi
ence among minei," says Colonel Payne.
"I assayed some of it myself and it ran to
$4840 a ton. Several other assays from
bits of ore carelessly picked up assayed
over $3500 to the ton. 1 saw yesterday one
.chunk from the Noonday mine in Yuma
that every one said was wortn fully $130,
and it weighed exactly 103 pounds. Ihe
â whole town of Yuraa is crazy, and I never
saw such wild delirium even in Virginia
City than that there ii down there.
"Right on top of the veins of this won
derful mine in Picacho district is the tind
at Gleason twenty-seven miles east from
Yuma, in Arizona, and near Tonca sta
tion. There is little or no development
there, and only outcroppings of rock have
been mined, but so rich is the ore from
these outcroppinss that such men as D. E. I
Hubb.ird, who -old the HarquaHala mine
in 1893 for $2,000,000; William E. Prince 1
of Denver and George V. Ball oi Portland,
Or., are ther*Â» offering to buy mines for
sum* of Gver $100,000.
"The Gleason mine is the richest there.
Ore from it Has averaged over $1600 a ton
for two weeks. I saw several as
says that ran to $2870 a ton.
Gleason, its owner, was engineer for the
Yuma Electric Company two months ago.
He is almost insane to-day from his sud
den riches. I saw him yesterday morn
ine and he is considering an offer" from D.
E Hubbard of $10 J, 000 spot cash lor the
Gleason mine. H.s iriends tell him that
he has over $1,000,000 of gold in sight.
â¢'Ye<, the "luma country is going to be
thÂ« most wonderful gold camp on the Pa
cific Coast. There will be a mad stam
pede of miners to that section from ail
parts of the country."

Mine* Old Shaft.
ANGELS CAMP, Cat,., April 4.â An
eight-foot gold-bearing ledge assaying $40
per ton has just been discovered at the
Bald Hill mine. The discovery was made
about 200 feet from tbe old shaft.
J. C. Cramer of a Montana mining
firm has purchased tbe Silver Mountain
mine of Congdon Brothers of West Point
in this county, for $80,000 and the com
pany is developing it. It is the largest
mine of free-milling ore in the State and
yields $4 to the ton at a cost of 55 cents.
Bhonld the property continue to yield as
well as it does now it will prove one of the
most valuable mines of this kind in the
State.

the prospectors had not given the quartz

would produce in the way of minerals.
They started to drive a tunnel into the

Charles D. Lane, the millionaire gold

BEN HAM'S CAREER IN PORTLAND.
The Accused W;fe-foisoner of Syracuse
Weil Known in ihe Northern
Cty.
PORTLAND, Or., April 4â Howard C.
Beniiam, indicted a few days ago in Ba
tavia, N. V., for having poisoned his wife
with hydrocyanic acid, was a resident
here from 1892 to 1894. He anl Mrs. Ben
ham were admitted to beÃt society circles
until the summer of 1894, when they were
no louger welcome because of some queer
business transactions on Benhani's pait.
In November of that year Benham mys
teriousiy disappeared from Portland. His
wife was left behind, and she could give
no idea of her husband's whereabouts or
offer an explanation as to his strange con
duct. He left her with plenty of money
and there were no outstanding debt's
against him.
Mrs. Benham was inclined to the belief
that her hu^b.md had met with foul play,
and the case was called to the attention of
the city detectives. They made an inves
tigation and satisfied themselves that
there were no good grounds for suspicions
of such a nature. Everything pointed to
the fact that Benham had, for some un
known cause, deliberately decamped.
This conclusion was not reached for
two montlis alter Benham had gone. The
life insurance companies holding $20,000
risks on him wre about to pay the money
over to the widow when news reached
here that Benham had been seen in Chi
cago witn Florence Clayman, a pretty
vaudeville actress, whose people live here.
However, tbe policy was not canceled, as
Mrs. Benham agreed to keep up the pay
ments. Mrs. Benham remained in this
city ior about three montlis after her hus
band's disappearance, and ihen lelt for
New York, wbere she announced her in
tention of making ncr home with her
parents.
EVERETT'S SENSATION.
Snohormsh County Grand Jury Returns
Thirty-One Indictments Ajainst
Officas.
EVERETT, WAOL, April 4.â Everett
and Snobornish County have a sensation
in the form of thirty-one indictments re
turned yesterday by the Grand Jury,
many of which have not yet been made
public. After months of hard work the
jury submitted a voluminous report,
practically substantiating the charges of
many irregularities in the letting of con
tracts for county work aud in employing
special insDectors ana superintendents of
bridges wnen tbe work etiouM have been
performed by the County Surveyor. Ex
pert Fairweather, who was employed Li 3'
the Grand Jury, nnearthed other irregu
larities, which proved not indictable be
cause the law prescribes no penalty for
the transactions in which the County
Commissioners are alleged to have in
dulged. The jury censurea the officials
for the reckless expenditure of money in
hiring special attorneys to conduct cases.
One indictment was against ex-Surveyor
Sbeehan for an alleged irregularity in're
porting on the Deer Creek road, on which
the Commissioners allowed a bill for
$3000.

Sautaluo'i fire Signal*.
SAUSALITO. Cal., April 4â Thomas
Frost, the manager of the Sausalito Elec

scheme for sending in an alarm of fire.

MARKET REVIEW
No Sabs of Special Im
portance Reported Dur
ing the Week.
Activity in Bui'ding Still Con
tinues in All S.c ions of
the City.
Holders Are Stubborn in R gard to
Their liras of Value and Rfuse
to Maki Concessions.
The week has developed nothing of special
Importance in real-estate matters. Every
thing of a cheerful character pervades the
surroundings, and the impression among
brokers ii that this summer mil prove to be
the best, from a real-estate standpoint, that
we have had since the lioom of 181)0.
Building is in projress in All directions, and
Eojie of it is of miignlilcent and costly char
acter. House materials have been so abun
dant and cheap durins the pa<t year or so that
the temptation to build has been hard to re
sist when there has be.ll an intention to do
such work.
There is increasing Inquiry for well-located
property at the various agencies, yet the
amount of actual trading is far from being
considerable. This anomaly is easily ex
plained by the fact that bargains are still be
ing loused for with lingering fondness, while
holders are stubborn in regard to their ideas
of value and positively decline to make con
cessions on asking prices. â¢
This is another indication that property
owners are not lacking in faith and confi
dence, being well content to anchor their
money in real estate in preference to any
other kind of security.
According to Wolfe's Building Review the
record of building operations fur the month
of March timing the past ten years Is as fol
lows :

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
DEPOSITIONS ARE
NOT IN FAVOR
How Faith Was Broken
in the Pardee Will
Contest.
Merchants Want an Honest
System of Awarding the
County Contracts.
One Reason Why the State Needs a
N.w Constitution and Oakland
a New Charter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 4. J
It is not hkeiy that there will be any
more depositions taken in the Pardee will
contest. It now appears that both sides
repent the fact that so much has been
given to the public.
When the contest was first filed there
was an informal verbal agreement entered
into between all parties concerned that
THADDEUS FITCH'S Plan to Consolidate the Broad and Narrow
Gauge Ferry Systems and Usz But One Bridge.
none of the unpleasant details should be
given oat oy either side. Th s was con
sidered to be hut dignified treatment of
the memory of the deceased Dr. Pardee.
The doctor was a prominent Mason and a
man who stood well socially, politically
and professionally. He figured promi
nently in official life in this city and was
one of the most valuable Mayors Oakland
ever bad.
During the Utter years of his life occa
sional wbispers that all was not as serene
as it migut bo In the Pardee household
were heard, but no attention was paid to
them, and after bis death his many
friends and his relatives were anxious
that none of the cnrefu.lv concealed skele
tons should be unmasked and brought
into the light of public criticism and pos
sibly derision.
This agreement was faithfully kept for
a few weeks, when everybody > concerned
was surprised to see a lengthy section of
Mrs. Pardee's deposition published. It
was very evident that the article Bad not
been inspired by Mrs. Pdrdee, the widow,
and she violently obj cted to bein â¢ placed
in what she called a false position before
the public. Her attorneys also expressed
dissatisfaction that the unwritten truce
had been broken, and from that time on
for several days the unpleasant inside his
tory of the doctor's family lias been mer
cilessly laid bare. .
. To-day it was stated by one of those in
terested in the contest that it is not likely
that any more depositions will be desired
as such proceedings cannot now be kept
from the public on account of the bitter
ness known by the respective sides to the
battle. This being the case, and public
opinion being equally divided as to the
merits and demerits of all* parties con
cerned, there will probably be no more
evidence taken until the case shall come
to trial. - - -
The natna of Pardee has always been
respected in this county, and the hosts of
acquaintances of the late w'nole-souled
doctor cannot sufficiently express their
regret that a compromise was not effected
before now.
Wben the time coaies for awarding the
contract for supplies to the county infirm
ary the merchants of Oakland want to be
heart on the manner in which contracts
are let. Last year the method adopted was
that known as the "unit system." By
this system it is possible for tbe county to
pay twenty per cent more for tne goods
that are bought than their market price,
and yet be awarding the contract to the
lowest bidder. The system adopted con
sists in adding together ail tbe prices of
all the articles for which bids are asked
and of dividing the total amount by the
number of kinds of goods bi.a upon.
This same principle is adopted in regard
to all the stationery supplies and other
materials furnished by the Board of Super
visors In the various county institutions.
When bids were awarded nearly a year
ago Mr. F'.sn, then president of tbe Mer
chants' Exchange, showed conclusively
tbat the system at present in use is tha
most ridiculous and unbusinesslike timt
could possibly be conceived. Ho showed
bow. by putting an absurdly low price on
article* of winch little are used and by
putting a price larger than that of tbe
market upon articles of 'which a great
quantity Is used, a bidder would be
accorded a unit considerably lower than
tbe merchant who bids fair prices in both
cases, and whose bid, if accepted, would
be several hundred dollars less tban tbat
which produces the lowest unit. A very
little figuring will show this.
The market value of a barrel of fish is
$16. About two barrels a year are used.
Thousands of sacks of potatoes arÂ» v ed,
upon whif-h a market value of $1 50 may
be placed. A contractor, by bidding $1 on
!i-h and $1 75 on potatoes, would 1 c ac
corded a unit of $1 37K, whereas the mer
chant who bids $15 lor fish and $1 50 for
potatoes would have a unit of $8 25. A
little figuring will show that if two barrels
of fish and 1000 sacks of potatoes are used
at the Infirmary in a year the man with a
unit of $8 25 will save to tne county $222
on these two items alone.
Tb<"se facts were amply demonstrated to
the Board of Supervisors by the Mer
chants' Exchange, and if the Supervisors
can evolve an excuse for not adopting the
recommendation of the Grand Jury they
will be much more clever than they are at
present credited with being.
In two months' time the annual elec
tion for school teachers for the Oakland
department will take place. The custom
prevails at present of electing teachers
every June to serve for one year only.
No matter how competent or industrious
they may be. no teacher has the assurance
that be or she will be employed longer
than a year. This system of election is in
accordance with the present charter nnd
must prevail until the charter is amended.
Two years ago the charter was rery
unwisely amended in the matter of the
Board of Public Work. It took a special
â¢ lection and a special act of the Legisla
ture to amend the charter on that occn
sion, and the same procedure wilJ bave
to be gone through before any change can
take place in the rules eoverning the
school department. Tnis being tbe case,
it is but one more argument in favor of a
charier that will be infinitely more intelli
gent and practicable than tbe present
garbled affair, and, incidentally, in view
of the lengthy procedure nrcessarv to an
amendment, it is also an ar ument in
favor of a new constitution for tbe State,
which shall give to cities a less cumbrous
method of eoverning themselves than
they at present t-njoy.
Becanse Oakland would like to amend
her charter, or, indeed, to bave an en
tirely new one, is surely no reason why
tbe ma<ter should have to be passed up n
by the Legislature of the entire State.

PLAN TO AVOID
ONE DRAWBRIDGE
An Alameda Capitalist Has
an Idea That Is Prac
tical.
Three Boats Could Give Better
Service Than Is N-w Given
by Four.
By Its Terms There Wou'd Be No
Use for tbe Condemned Alice-
Street Bridge.
Oakland Ottice Sax Fbajjcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 4. j
A perfectly feasible plan of dispensing
with one drawbridge, and one in close
touch with President Huntin^ton's syste
matic policy of railway management, is
submitted by Tbaddeus S. Fitcn of this
City. He proposei to run the broad and
narrow gauge boats from the foot of Mar
ket street to their resp ctive piers on this
side of the bay. as at present, with the
short additional run between the piers
to complete the triangle â one boat to run
from Market street to Oakland pier,
thence to the Alameda mole and back to
San Francisco, the other boat to run on
the opposite course, viz.: from Market
street to the Alameda mole, thence to the
Oakland pier and back to the starling
point, passing one another a long dis
tance apart and thereby lessening the risk
of collision in fogzy weather.
By this plan it is believed that three
boats could perform the service now re
quired of four.
The very light expense of laying a third
rail from Pacific avenue station on the
narrow-gauge roadbed to the end of the
mole would connect the piers of the Aia
raeda broad-guage line and the Oakland
Seventh-street line, forming a horseshoe
b^nd at or near High street. All broad
gauge trains could thus run in opposite
directions from pier to mole around the
horseshoe track through Alameda, Fruit
vale and Seventh street, Oakland, and
vice versa.
This would involve a lons end short
trip, differing in time only two or three
minutes on the boat* only, instead of til
teen or twenty minutes on the trains, as
proposed uv Engineer yon Schmidt in
The Call of March 31. Passengers could,
however, avail themselves of the swing
around the all-rail circle if they chose, lor
such a trip would doubtless become very
ponular.
The abandonment of the narrow-eauge
trains over a drawbridge into Oak. and
would necessarily follow, but the addi
tional trips on the Seventh-street line,
together with the increased comfort and
novelty of taking the train going in either
direction and avoiding the tedious wait at
stations, would more than compensate
for the loss of the short line from First to
Fourteenth streets. The present rnn of
the narrow-gauge trains through Alameda
need not be interfered with.
All broad-gauge trains would then run
in opposite directions from pier to mole
around the horseshoe track through Ala
moda to Hich street, Fruitvale, and Sev
enth street, Oakland, and return. The
Alice-street drawbridge could be dispensed
with, while the Webster-street structure
could stand and serve the purpose for
I which it was built.
Tim Cohen Iniurauce,
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 4.â The state
ment having been made tbat the premium
paid fora term of year* on the policies on
the Cohen property would, if invested,
have equaled the value of tha property,
has brought out a statement from Captain
Cbipman, the well-known insurance man.
He says tbat the highest rate paid on ihe
property for the past twenty-four years
was 40 cents on the $100, which, with a
total of |150.000 insurance, would amount
to $14,400. Estimating that this was in
verted as paid in. lie says the total with
interest at the usual rale would not have
been more than $15,400, as against $300,000,
the estimated value of the property de
stroyed.

MISSION DAIRIES TO GO
Propsrty- Owners or Excelsior
Homestead Want Im
provements
School Houses lo Take tbe Place of
Cow Sbeds and H g
P ns.
Excelsior Homestead with Uh 120 blocks
on the face of the hill south of tie Mission
road is just now receiving its share of pub
lic attention through the action of the
Mission Five-mile Improvement Club of
wnich Dr. E. N. Torello is president.
This section of the City has been hereto
fore neglected in so far as public improve
ments went, and has been generally used
as grazing run for da rymen for their cat
tle.
This condition of affairs is now, how
ever, about to undergo a change, and in
stead of the bellow of the cow the sweet
voic-'s of the children will soon be heard
romping about in mirth and fun.
Toe oiub, without a dissenting voice,
has petitioned the Board of Supervisors to
extent the pound limits, and iv one par
agraph it says:
'"By eliminating the cow, hog and goat
ranches from tbrse distr cts the City will
greatly cain taxable property, as hun
dreds of homes will positively be erected
if a better state of affairs is inaugurated
there."
With this object in view a petition ha 3
also been forwarded to the Bchool Direc
tors to built an eight-class schoolhnuse on
China avenue near Mission street, with
the request that it be named th 6 "Monroa
Primary." This modern structure is in
tended to take the place of thepre-ent
â¢'ramshackle" cowshed, where some of the
children are compelled to attend school,
while others are being provided with ac
commodations in that cueeriess structure
known as Liguri Hall.
In addition to this the Board of Health
is requested to have the dairies removed
from the midst of the inhabited settle*
merit.
Ai the request of the club members Sec
retary M. H. Levy read the resolutions
which had been drafted for the various
City governing bodies, and without any
loss of time these were signed by a ma
jority of the property-owners affected by
the proposed improvements.
President Toreilo stated that the Su
pervisors would appropriate $10 000 for
the betterment of the bridge over tne Mis
sion Creek west of Collpotp Hill. Also
that the Spring Valley Water Company
would replace the smail pipes alon^ Mis
sion street from Silver avenue to Ocean
View. This will, when done, give ample
protection a ainst destruction in case of
fire, as convenient hydrants and firealarm
boxes will be placed along the street line.

BUDD IS SLICING
THE OFFICIAL PIE
Many Hungry Democrats
Are Clamoring for a
Piece.
Â£. D. McCabe Will Ultimately
Become Secretary of the Har
bor Commissioners.
The Position of State Librarien Is
Only Designed to Fill a Gap for the
Retiring Private Secretary.
It ia contended that Judge Bridgford
and A. Caminetti, Assemblymen in the
recent Legislature, are not disqualified
from serring on the Code Commission by
reason of their votes on that subject. Had
they voted to create the commission they
would not be eligible, but only having
voted on the proposition to abolish the
commission it is claimed that tiiey are
not rendered ineligible.
Governor Budd was in the City yester
day, but was seeking repose after the ar
duous labors of last week. The duty of
appointing the Code Commissioners and
the Auditing Board of fublio Works,
otherwise known as the dredger scheme,
now devolves upon bim.
There will be one Republican Code
Commissioner, and Judge Daly is an ac -
ive aspiiant for reappointment. The
Judge did not get anything from the pub
lic treasury for assisting the Attorney-
General in risrhting the Southern Pacific
case in the Uniied States Circuit Court.
The plan put up by the Board of Exam
iners was to appropriate a lutun sum of
$25,000 for W. VV. Foote, Robert Y. Hayne
and Judge Daly, but when the Legislature
considered that Daly was drawing a good
salary from the Mate when the case was
tried it was decided to eliminate his share
entirely from the bill, hence the measure
vras pus-ed allowing Foote $10,000 and
Hayne $10,000. If Daly get* anything for
this display of legal lore on the side he
must t et it from Fooie and Hayne. Billy
Foote has a reputation for generosity, and
hÂ« may perpetuate it by pungling over
$5000 to Daly.
Ryland Wallace, who is accredited with
having performed most ol the work of
code revision during the past two years,
may be retaiued on the commission. In
the event of his retention either Bridgford
or Caminetti would be counted out of cal
culations for servic â  in that direction.
Peter Shiels, who has held the office of
â ecretary of the commission, a job that
pays $200 a month, is about to resign to be
come private secreiary of the Governor.
There are several applicants (or the Shiels
vacancy. I*adore Alexander, who is con
nected with the commission, may be pro-
moted. He was an original Budd man in
the 5. ate convention and was active in the
campaign that followed.
At a meeting of the State Board of
Library Trustees held in this City last
Saturday the resignation of Dr. Mathews,
State Librarian, was considered. E. D.
McCabe. who is to be succeeded as private
secretary of the Governor by Peter Snieis,
is on the slate to succeed Mathews. The
knowinjj Democrats profess to believe
that Mi.'Cabe cannot be ousted from the
library by the incoming Republican
Board of Trustees and that he can serve
four years from tbe date of his appoint
ment. The salary of the Governor's pri
vate secretary is $4000 per year and the
â alary of the Stale Librarian $3000 a year.
Shou'u McCabe fail to hold the office of
Librarian under Republican rule he could
be made secretary of the State Board of
Harbor CoiumisMoners, as the Democrats
now control that board. Mr. Keegan, the
present secretary, a Republican, has yet
nearly two years to serve. Democratic
politicians who do the closest figuring as
rert that if McCabe goes into ths State
Library tbe job will be relinquished when
X vegan's successor is elected.
W. W. Foote, it is said, can be attorney
of the Harbor Commissioners if he desires,
but lawyers who know something of
Foota's practice say that he could not af
ford to take the pace.
At last accounts A. J. Clunie had not
received his commission as Insurance
Commissioner to serve out tbe unexpirea
terra of M. R. Higgins, resigned. Last
Thursday the Governor wired Mr. Hig
gins to serve a few days more, as he could
not then appoint hi* successor. The be
lief is strong in insurance circles that A.
J. will get the place.
Before the 17ta inst. the Governor must
appoint live persons who shall be citizens
of California and not all members of the
same political p^rty, who shall be known
as the Auditing Board to the Commis
sioner of Public Works. The bill creating
this board, which carries an appropriation
of $300,000, vras approved March 17. and
requires that the appointments shall be
made within thirty days of the passage of
the act.

MANY MEMBERS
FOR THE C. A. C.
The New Organization
Heartily Supported by
Wheelmen.
Judge Kerrigan Tells Why the
League Was Unsatis
factory.
Much Money Was Sent East, bu
Very L ttle Returned to
This Division.
The California Associated Cyclers, the
name by which the organization to sup
plant the northern division of the
Leaeue of American Wheelmen will be
known, is loÃing no time in its prepara
tions to assault the membership of the
National association.
Ju<lge Frank Kerrigan, erstwhile chief
consul of tbis division of the League of
American Wheelmen, and chairman of
the organization committee of the new as
sociation, has found time to draw up a
plan of attack which promises to be most
effective in swelling the C. A. C. mem
bership, and early in this week the vari
ous proselytizing agencies wiil be in active
operation.
"Within ninety days," said Judge Ker
rigan last evening, "we expect to have a
membership of 1000, and the good work
will undoubtedly go on. This movement
is at present distinctively Californian, and
we count on the patriotism of the wheel
men to support us.
"Balors the end of this week I will ap
point all the local consuls of the division,
and they will commence soliciting mem
bers at once. Victor Hancock will start
on the road during the week as tiie auly
accredited representative of the organiza
tion, and irum him we have reason to ex
pect good returns. He will receive a
percentage oi the membership dues as
compensation and wiil probably also rep
resent some cycle firm.
"The advantaged which a local organiza
tion will have are numerous and impor
tant. Th:"s division of the L. A. W. has
now about 1700 members. Last year we
sent back $ltiiHj for membership dues, and
of this $1040 was retained in the East. Of
the $560 wnich was returned to us we were
compelled to pay an attorney, a secretary
treasurer, stationery bills, expenses of
delegates to meetings, the cost of issuing
road books and minor disbursements. The
new association wiil cover the entire scope
of the league and we will be manifestly
better equipped when we retain all the
membership fees.
-'What provisions will be made in re
gard to racing cannot be accurately stated
at this time. We will communicate with
all associations both in this country and
in foreign countries whicu control racing,
and we will probably recognize only such
organizations as will rrcogniza us.
"Ail the riders in this division with
lour exceptions will race under our sanc
tions. The exceptions are Wells, McFar
land and Ziagler, who left for the East
tb;s morning, and possibly W. A. Terrill,
who expects to go East. Waiter Foster
and Harry Terriil have agreed to ride
here in the first Sunday races, which will
be neid April 18.
"The Southern California riders â though
that portion of the State has not yet co
operated with us in this movement â will
be forced to get in line, as most of their
riders of importance are already under
the ban of the L. A. W. for Sunday riding
at Santa Monica."
Judge Kerrigan dwelt upon the im
portant work which the wheelmen of thi s
division, under league auspices, had ac
complished, and predicted that they would
be even more active in tne new associ
ation. He prophesied tnat members
would be much more easily obtained than
for the league.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
J. C. Netlon and i.. Linehan Defeat T.
V. Bonnet and Al Hampton.
The handball :-ames played in the San
Francisco court yesterday were witnessed
by a large crowd. The event of the day
was a eanie in which J. C. Nealon and R.
Linehan, the overhand swiDer, played
against T. P. Bonnet and Al Hampton. It
was closely con tested, the fiual game
being won by Nealon and Linehan by
one ace.
Another game which caused some
money to change hands was played be
tween J. Lawless and Dan Rodgers and R.
tinea aud D. Connolly. It was a walkover
for Lawless and Rodgers.
Much interest is being taken in the
single-baud game to ba played next Sun
day afternoon between Coast Champion

many admirers and considerable money

COMMERCE AND RELIGION.
Special Services I'o-Uity for tlie Benefit
of Business Men.
For the next ten days, beginning with
to-day, the Chamber of Commerce will be
the scene of a religious gathering, with
business men as the congregation and the
Very Rev. Percy C. Webber, Archdeacon
of Milwaukee, as the preacher.
It is doubtful if a more eloquent voice
than that of Atchdeacon Webber has ev>r
been heard in . the Chamber. Simple,
direct and persuasive in style, he appeals
at once to the heart and conscience of his
audience.
Archdeacon Webber Is a member of tbe
order of preaching missioners of the
Episcopal church. He has traveled the
country over holding missions. At St.
John's Churcb in this City, where he has
just concluded a mission, his sermons at
tracted wide interest. At the Good
Samaritan Mission his success was mar-
Telous. In Stockton the audiences he
gathered numbered thousands.
At these services a few moments will be
spent in devotional exercises, succeeded
by a short address. The prospect of large
audiences is said to be very good.

THEY MET AFTER
THIRTY YEARS
Reunion of the Brothers
Antone and E. M.
Zvietich.
The Story of a Confederate Sol
dier Who Returned to
Austria.
Was Present in Constantinople When
Thousands of Armenians Were
Massacrel by the Turks.
Anlone Zvietich, well known to the
early prospectors about Virginia City just
prior to the discovery of the Comstocfc
lode, was a prominent figure yesterday in
Antone Zvietich, the E dit
Brother, Who Witnessed the
Armenian Massacres.
a family reunion after a separation of
thirty years.
Antone is not such a very old man now,
being only 62 years of age, but he has
crowded into his life such experiences as
make a man's history most interesting.
He and his two brothers were born in
Lagosta, an island in the Adriatic. Whiie
they were still in their teens end he had
just turned into manhood he sailed away
to America, landing in New Orleans,
where he was almost immediately enlisted
in what was known as the Spanish Regi
ment, in 1860, at the opening of the war.
He served until its close and traveled on
to Virginia City, where he opened a
outcher and grocer shop. Money was
plentiful and he became rich enough to
indulge in a trip home in 1867. He was
anxious to see his parents and brothers,
after which he was to return to tuis coun-
try.
In the meantime he fell in love and
married, and his plans were entirely
changed. Instead of returning to America
he remained away, but shipped off his
two brothers, E VL and Joseph Zvietich,
the former reaching this City, where he is
a prosperous fruit-shipper, and the latter
going to New Zealand, where he is a
wealthy wool-grower.
It has been the intention of the three
brothers to have a reunion in this City,
and in carrying th:s out E. M. and
Antone met yesterday morning at Benicia
afier thirty years' separation and are both
in the former's home at 231 Valencia
street.
Antone Btill remembers English suffici
ently to entenain his visitors.
"I did not know bini when he came and
tapped me on the shoulder n the train,"
he said alluding to his brother. 'He was
only 17 years old when I sent him to
America â a big fat boy. Now he is a
grown man with a wife and two children."
In thirty years' time Antone has been
treated fairly well. Age seems to have
affecied him only in the additional frost
on I. is hi ai.
"I have had some trying situations,"
he said. "My wife and lour children have
died. 1 have brought three children
here with me. but my other two are at
sctiool in Austria.
"1 saw the beginning of the Armenian
troubles when I was in Russia, from 1868
until last year. The Armenians demand
ed their freedom from the Turks, and, in
stead, they were only killed in a most un
merciful way. Last August I was in Con
stantinople when 5000 Armenians were
killed by the Turks in less than twenty
lour hours. Tbey were shot down with
out mercy â men, women and children â
or else they were carried out on vessels on
the Bosphorus and decapitated or
thrown overboard. There was no time to
bury them in those days. The carnage
and horrible sights I witnessed make me
believe that the Turks are the most cruel
people ou earth.'
WILLING TO WORK.
The Great Army of Unemployed In the
Howard-Street Shelter.
Tbere were 340 willing men who ac
cepted couches last night at the Howard
street shelter for the unemployed.
Most of these bare not yet been able to
get employment on the boulevard, and
they are looking forward to the time when
their turn will come for employment. In
the meantime they must depend upon the
benefits of the shelter, the larder of which,
by the way, is not too well stocked. A
few more sacks of fl >ur or beans and a side
or two of beef, as well as anything in the
way of substantial food, would be eagerly
accepted.
Tbese members of the army of the un
employed have shown themselves to be
really deserving. Those who have been fur
nished with work have nearly all branched
off and are keeping themselves on their
scant wages. Tbey call around at head

quarters, however, to see how their com
panions are faring, but they keep away
from drawing upon the food allowance of
those who have as yet failed to get em
ployment.
A" creditable feature in connection with
the unemp oved who make their home in
the vast Howard-street domicile is that
only two men have caused any disturb
ance in the past two months. In both
cases the men were half-starvea, and suc
cumbed to a slight quantity of intoxi
cants that would have had no effect upon
them under conditions of better nourish
ment.
The hour for rising is 5:30 o'clock in the
morning, and last nigtit at 10 o'clock the
340 who lay asleep on the hard floor of the
great dormitory til expected to be put to
work to-day.
EASTERN RACERS DEPART.
Loughead, lalmi and. Other Crack
Cyclers Have Gone Home.
The Eastern cycle racers have gone.
With the closing of the indoor tournament
Saturday night track racing on the coast
will cease for some little time, and most
of the riders hayÂ« departed for their homes
for a short r*st before beginning their ca
reers on the National circuit of 1897.
Those who went were Fred Loughead,
Jay Eaton, Floyd A. McFarland, O. L.
Stevens and Charles S. Wells, accom
panied by F. Ed Spooner, correspondent,
and wife and .UaveSnafer, trainer.
W. E. Becker left for Minneapolis last
night. Becker, Lougheed, Stevens and
Eaton are anxious to come out here aga<n
next fall, and were well pleaded with their
treatment by the local wneelmen. Wells
and McFarland are Califomians and wiil
return after the circuit is over.
OttoZiegler Jr. expects to go East in
about a week.
SINGLE-TAKERS CONFIDENT.
Surveyor-General Green Addresies the
Local Society.
At the regular weekly meeting of the
Single Tax Society at 909 Market street
last evening, Surveyor-General Will S.
Green, a pioneer resident of Colusa
E. M. Zvietich, the Younger
Brother.
County and editor of the Colusa Sun, ad
dressed a larpe and attentive audience,
"Although twenty years ago," he said,
"I waÂ« on the othÂ»r side, and used to op
pose Henry George's theories, I have be
come convinced of the justice and desira
bility of a single tax upon land values.
The only disagreement I have with the
sinjfle-taxers is in regard to the method to
be pursued. It seems to roe that we
should direct our energies chiefly to con
vincing the small land-owners of the ne
cessity uf duing away with the taxes on
personal property and improvements,
which scarcely pay the cost of collecting
th*m."
Jamea 8. Reynold* recounted briefly the
progress made during the past four year',
and gave a detailed account of the consti
tutional amendment, giving the Legisla
ture the power of regulating taxation,
which was proposed in the last Legisla
ture and defeated by a small margin.
"The amendment was defeated," he de
clared, "through the influence of a few
land speculators of this city."
KILLED BY SAT POISON.
The Foolish Act of Emma Griffiths, a
Young Woman,
Emma Griffiths, 18 years of ago, who re
sided at 128 Silver street, committed sui
cide by takine a dose of rouÂ«h on rats.
The young woman was mailly in love with
a man named James Strice. In fact she
was bo desperately in love with the man
that she couH not pet aloin.' without him
even for a day, and the knowledge that
Strice was about to deuart for lah An
geles ou this morning's train for v shon
pleasure trip was more than she could
bear.
To her mind there was but one remedy
for such despair, and that was in death.
A convenient box of rat ex?erm nator set
tled the question with Miss Grilhtns, and
s: c took a large dose of tnÂ»j stuff. A little
later the nirl met the object of ber hope
less love on rourth street and spoiled the
pleasure of his trip by telling him that
when ne was on biÂ« way to the sunny land
of the south she would be on her way to
the cold, damp grave.
Strice was practical enough to send the
foolish girl to the Receiving Hospital
where Dr. J. Kearney d.d all he could to
relieve her of the rat poison, but to no
purpose, for she died about midnight.

EXCITING RACES
ALONG THE FRONT
A Splendid Sailing Breezs
and Very Close
Finishes.
Dave Crowley Jr. Beat His
Father in Two Races Dur
ing the Day.
The Sealing Schooner Luisa D Im
ported Off Cape Arago With
650 Skins Aboard.
There were two exciting boat races from
off Meiges wharf yesterday. The course
was from a point off the wharf around
Blossom Rock, thence back to a point off
Powell-street wharf, thence to the Pre
sidio shoal buoy and theu back to the
starting point.
The first race was to have been a match
between D. Crovley Br. and W. F. Fitz
eerald for $50 a side, but as Fitzgerald is
still a very sick man the contest could not
take place. Dave Crowley Jr. rolun
teered to take Fitzgerald's place and give
his father a few pointers. They got away
together, but in rounding 810-som Rock
the son took the lead and his father was
never able to head him. There was never
more than half a dozen Doat lengths be
tween them at any time, and it was as
pretty a trial of skill as has ever been seen
on the bay.
The second race was started about 2
r. m. with half the Whitehall in the bay
entered. It was hotiy contested from
vtart to finish, and Tom Murrey won by a
short margin from Dave Crowley Jr., with
Dave Crowley Sr. third.
The picnic and prize shooting at
Schuetzen Park drerv forth an enormous
crowd yesterday, and Sergeant Tom Ma
honey and six policemen had all they
tould do to handle it. At one time the
waiting-rooms and sidewalks were packed,
and thieves made hay while the sun
Hbone. ThÂ« 1:30 boat was twenty min
utes late in getting away, and over 300
people were left behind.
Among those who were robbed was John
Fiicger, secretary of me Grocery men's
Union, and who also Keeps a grocery store
on the corner of Sixteenth and Guerrero
street*. He had $110 taken from his hip
pocket. A Mrs. Wilson lost her watch
and chain, and when the matter was re
ported to the sergeant of police present
cc at once mounted a box and called out
at the top of his voice: "Keep a cood
lookout after your money and valuables;
there are pickpockets among you." The
only los< after that was one of $2 50, whicn
a young man who refused to give his
name, reported to one of the officers. On
the return trip the crowVl was a fairly
orderly one, owing to tue presence of at
least a dozen policemen.
Captain Warner of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Railroad Company bad
a narrow escape yesterday. One or the
steamers was aboutdue and he walked out
on the apron to see if it was at its proper
Height. It just happened that the pawls
were not set and Warner's weight caused
the apron to co down with a rush, throw
ing him into the bay. His cries brought
assistance and he was hauled back r>n to
the wharf again. Before changing his
clothes he got the apron back into posi
tion and proceeded to set the pawls. In
doing so one of them caught his fore
finger and pinced out a big piece of flesh.
The wound was dressed by the company's
doctor and Captain Warner is now going
around witb his hand in a sling.
The steamer Dei None, which cot in
yesterday, spoke the Louisa D off Cape
Arago. The sealing schooner asked to be
reported as all well and 650 skins aboard.
The United States steamer Alert got in
from Honolulu yesterday, after a 13 days'
passage. She sai;ed before the Rio de
Janeiro, consequently she has no news.
The officers say that the trouble with thÂ«
Japanese is nothing but what the
Hawaiian Government can handle. The
Alert will remain here a few days and
will then go to Mare Island for an over

RAILROAD MEN
MIKE A DISCOVERY
Engineers Are Not Debar
red From Joining the
Federation.
Important Matters Were De
cided Upon at a Meeting in
West Oakland.
Four Leaiing Unions Will Make an
Assessment and Send cut a
Circular at Oncj.
Oakland Office Sa>* Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 4. f
An important discovery was made this
afternoon to an enthusiastic meeting of
representatives of the various railway em
ployes.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers, Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen,
Order of Railway Conductors, Brotner
hood of Locomot.ve Firemen and Order of
Railroad Telegraphers were represented.
T. M. Pierson, assistant great chief of the
O. R. T. of Terre Hau;e, Ind., was also
present and aided in their deliberations.
C. E. Houc* of the O. R. C. presided
and George Buien of the B. of 11. T. acted
as secretary.
The B. L. E. members present at a
previous meeting gave it as their law that
they could not federate without the con
sent of their board of adjustment, and
that board would not meet for eighteen
months. Since that time a letter has been
received from Grand Cnief Engineer P. M.
Arthur wnich contradicts ihis a-sertion,
lor ne say? in a letter to P. N. Morriay,
grand master of the B. of R. T. :
The members of the B. L. E. upon any sys
tem can federate with tua oreamzations
named in the articles of federation by a two
thirds vote vi ti.c members. When the men
have voted I nave always approved of it wheu
signed by the chairman and secretary of the
general board of adjustment. I have never
considered thai it was necessary to have the
approval of the general boaid of adjustment
after they had ob'ained a two-thirds vote of
the membership upon the system.
The secretary was instructed to corre
spond with Chairman Stafford of Stock
ton to secure ail information possible in
regard to the federation now in existence.
In answer to a question as to me standing
of the federation at present, Mr. Fierson
said :
"We propose to revive the old federa
tion. Three years ago the federation
erected a buiiuiaj:. Tn-n an A. R. U.
cyc'une sweM over this country and
swept it alt away but the foundation.
>iow we propose to build a new structure
upon this foundation. We are already
federated, and we want everybody to
know it. I believe in printing and send
ing out a circular to this effect at once."
The various iotie.es represented will be
asked to appropriate 5 cents per member
for the necessary expenses of the union
meetings. Suggestions were made that
ihe railroad boys refrain from the use of
Chinese cigars and that McKmiey be
thanked for turning down General Otis of
Los Angeles.
Mr. Piersnn then spoke as follows:
To-day is the day of rest, and if there are
any men who need this rest it is the men who
handle our trains. lam glad to talk of federa
tion. It is me highest pinnacle of strength
one can reach jn this world. Federation is
simply a tiiumph 01 or?aniz*iion.
Organized labor i.s organized thought. Or
ganized thought is the organization that has
Kivi-n down-troilden meu ihe;r ireedom. The
United States is a fair simple of federation.
Foreign powers respect the flag. Will people
recognize the nag of the O. R. T. unless she is
federated with other railroad organizations?
No more than Mexico would recognize Texas
if she were not federated with the other States.
By their absence this afternoon the B. of L.
E. Intimate that their flag is recognized with
out federation. '1 he day is coming wnen the
a. P. Company will no more recognize them
than if they were not in existence. I dou't be
lieve that the S. P. officials are opposed to fed
eration. I hear you talk of them as fair
minded men. If they are they will see they
will be as much benefited as you are. It is to
tneir best interests that you bare a common
understanding.
THE TURNERS ENTERTAIN. '
Gymnastic Exhibition for the Benefit
of the I'riz : â¢ Grade.
San Francisco Turner Hall at 323 T ark
street was crowded last evening, the occa
sion being a gymnastic exhibition and ball
for the benefit of the San Francisco Turn
Verein prize turners competing in the
quadrennial pr ze tournament of the
North American Turners' Union, to be
held in St. Loui;*, Mo., from May 6 to 11.
The local organization will send East
eight men and two alternates with the
teachers. A neat sura was realized by the
entertainment last eveniug.
The programme was well prepared and
executed. It consisted of the wand drill
by the prize grade, a wrestling contest be
tween J. Will of the Oakland Turn Verein
ami George Hildebrand of the San Fran
ciÂ«co Turn Verein, exercises on two homes

"SIN FILLS ALL
THE WIDE WORLD"
Such Were the Words of
the Rev. Father Joseph
Byrne Last Night.
An Eloquent Sermon on Evil
zt St. Mary's Cathe
dral.
Impressive Ceremonies for Various ,
Societies Daring the Morning
Hoars.
There were several important services at
St. Mary's Cathedral yesterday, conclud
ing with a brilliant sermon at night by
Rev. Father Joseph Bvrne.
At 8 a. m. fully 1000 members of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians received the
communion, Father Crowley being in the
sanctuary. Mass was 'said by Archbishop
Riordau, assisted by Rev. Father Byrne
and Rev. Father Crowley.
At 3 F. m. the Calvarian Society had
devotions in charge of Rev. Father J. B.
Harrigan.
The sermon last night was by Rev.
Father Joseph Byrne, the theme being
"Sin."
"if we lived a thousand years," said
tna speaker, "there would be ample room
for improvement, for tbe command of the
Saviour was. 'Be ye perfect.' If we used
our powers aright our souls would be
beautiful to God, but by stubborn con
duct we defile our souls. We are creatures
of free will as a rule, but we must use our
wills properly or we fall. Love does not
appeal to the sinner, and nothing brings
him nearer to God. He passes through
the world like an animal.
"The world is full oi dangers and it is
always easy to sin, because tbe devil is
abroad, like a routine lion, seeking whom
he may devour. We are all rilled with
tbe tires of passion and we need oniy a
spark to light those passions into a flame.
We ought to always be in fear and trem
bling lest God call lor our souls any mo
ment, for God is good, God is merciful
and God is just. Beware of the tirst sin
for when it is entered upon it is like a
serpent and it devours all it comes upon
in the *orl<l."
