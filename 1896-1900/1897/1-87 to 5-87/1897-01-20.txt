LONDON, Eng.. Jan. 19.â Parliament
reassembled to-day for what promises to
be the most important session since Lord
Salisbury assumed the reins of Dower.
There was an unusually large attendance
in both houses, aue largely to the earnest
appeals that had been issued to their sup
porters by the leaders of the various
parties. To each member of the House of
Lords Earl Salisbury had addressed a per
sonal letter to this effect: "As it is proba
ble that matters of considerable import
ance will consume the discussion of both
houses I tru a t it may be consistent with
your lordship's convenience to be present
in your place upon the opening and fol
lowing days."
To the Conservative members of the
House of Commons Arthur James Bai
four had also addressed :i letter, saying
that, "Ar Par. lament will be immediately
invited to discuss important public ques
tions I earnestly hope that you will make
fuch arrungements as will enable you to
be present lrcm the beginning; of ihe
session?."
&.r 'William Harconrt also in his ad
dress to the radical members laid stress
upon the matters of importance that
would be brought at once under discus
sion.
There were the asjal scenes about West
minster Palace yard. A large crowd as
tcmbled early aui cheered lhe;r favorites.
William Yemen ilarcoun especially
i :imÂ« in for a warm reception. Shortly
after the n-.>on hour there was the usual
summons irom the upper chamber, and,
preceded by the BlacK R >>i, the com
moners rushed pell mell to the House of
Lord\ where the Queen's speech was read
by commission by the Lord Hijzh Chan
cellor, Lord HalsDury. It is as follows:
My Lords and Gentlemen: My relations
Tviih all of ihe other powers continue ;o bo oi
a friendly character. The appalling mas
sacres Mhicn have :aken place in Constarni
anJ other parts of the Ottoman domin
ions have called for the special attention of
the powers sien&tory to the treaty of Pari".
I'apers will be laid before you showing the
considerations which induced the powers to
make the present condition of the Ottoman
empire the subject of special consultation by
the representatives of the powers at Constan
tinople. The conference of the six Embassa
dors to :he Porte is still {ending.
.-. â  :ion undertaken by the Khedive of
Egypt a#ain>t the Khalifa with my approval
and assistance has been entirely successful.
His iorC'-s, supported by my officers and'
have won back the provinces of Don
gola to c:\iization by operations which were
conducted with remarkable skill and the way
haa been opened for a further advance when
ever such a storj is judged to be fitsirable.
My Government has discussed with the
United .States as a friend of Venezuela the
terms under which the pending questions of a
dispute on the frontier o: that country and the
temtor\ of Guiana may be subjected toarbitra
t'ou. An arrangement hns been arrived at
\vh;ch, I trust, will affect an adjustment of the
existing controversy without exposing to risk
the interests of any colonists who have estab
lished rights in th 3 Uis-puted territory. It is
with much gratification that I have concluded
a treaty forpenernl arbitration with the Presi
dent of thÂ« Umteil States by which I trust that
all differences which may arise between us
v ill be peacefully adjusted. I hope that this
frrangement may have further value in corn
tnending to other powers the consideration of
the principle by whrch the danger of war may
bly abated.
I he rebellion in Matabeleland has been re
i by the steadfastness and courage of
. n-e.iforced by my troops and
volunteers both of the English and Dutch
races. 1 dfc;,,<,re the loss of valuable lives
which those operations have entailed.
The depressed condition of .the sugar indus
try in the West Indian colonies has seriously
eff-cted their prosperity. I have appointed a
commis-sion to investigate the causes, and, if
Me, to suggest means of amelioration.
It is with much regret and with feclingi of
the deepest sympathy that I have heard that
owing to the failure of the autumn rains
scarcity and famine Rff Â»ct the larga portion of
India. Mv Government in that country is
making every effort to mitigate the suffering
and lessen the calamity by the development of
railways and irrigation works. Tho fore
tnought through a long series of years to the
preparation of the most t-flje'ive arrangements
for alleviating distress caus-ed b7 famino
makes their task more hopeful than in the
case of previous visitations. My people
throughout my dominions at home and in In
dia have been invited to second with their iib
erality the exertions of the Government. Pa
pers showing tne extent of the famine and the
measures taken to rel.eve the suffering will be
laid before you. A plague has also made its
appearance in Horn bay and Kurachee, and not
withstanding the precautions adopted by the
local authorities it shows no signs of decrease.
I have direc'.c 1 my investment to take the
Ftrongest measures for tue eradication of the
jiestilence.
Gentlemen of the House of Commons: The
I estimates of the year will belaid before you.
Â» While desirous of guarding an undue expen
â  diture 1 have felt thai the present condition
of the world will not permit you to depart
(/rom the spirit of prudent foresight in which
you have during recent years provided lor the
defense of the empire.
My lords and gentlemen : A measure for the
promotion of primary education, by securing
the maintenance of voluntary schools, will be
laid beiore you, and if time permits you will
invited to consider further proposals for edu
cational legislation.
It is desirable to make better provisions for
The San Francisco Call.
the compensation of working j^ople who
suffer from accidents, and a bill witn that ob
ject In view will bJ submitted to you.
Your consent will bo askea to provisions
which, in the judgment of the military
authorities, are required for the efficiency of
the military detenses of the empire.
A till will also be submitted to you to im
prove the arrangements for the water supply
of the metropolis.
In order to promote the interests of agricul
ture, which nre of paramount importance to
Ireland, you will be asked to consider a bill to
establish a Board of Agriculture, ana further
legislative proposals will be brought before
you if the time at your disposal is sufficient
for the purpose.
Bills admitting the evidence of accused per
sons, amending the law in respect to bills of
sale and the registration of land, for revising
ihe acts in relation to the formation of lim
ited companies, in regard to the agriculture
holdings act in Great Britain, the disposition
of goeds manufactured in prisons in other
countries, the erection of a reformatory lor in
ebriates, and for amending the existing pro
cedure in respect to private liils coining from
Scotland and Ireland have been prepared. I
heartily commend your important delibera
tions to the guidance of Almighty God.
There was an unusually large attend
ance of peeis at the opening of the House
of Lords, which met at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon. The lately appointed Arch
bishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev.
Frederick Temple, and the recently cre
ated Bishop of London, the Rt. Rev.
Mandell Craton. took the prescribed oath
as members of the upper House. The
Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cam
bridge occupied a cross bench and the
galleries were filled with the wives and
daughters cf peer*. United States Em
bassader Bayard and Mrs. Bayard occu
pied seats in the diplomatic gallery.
After the Lord Chancellor, Lord Salis
bury, had read the speech from the throne
the customary adaress in reply to tlie
speech was moved by the Marquis of
Bath, who was attired in the uniiorm of
an officer of the yeomen of the guard.
The motion was seconded by Lord Ken
yon.
The Earl of Kimberly, who was yester
day chosen as the leader of the Liberals
in the House of Lords in the place of
Lord Rosebery, resigned, said that he
deeply regretted that Lord Rosebery was
no longer the leader of the Liberal party,
fcpeakins on other matters he congratu
lated Lord Salisbury upon the success of
his negotiations with the United States.
In regard to Turkey he said be felt im
pelled to ask if the treaty of Berlin wa^
dead.
The benches of the House of Commons
were crowded with members and the gal
leries wre packed with privileged speeta
tois. Ri<:nt Hon. Arthur J. Baifour,
First Lord of the Treasury; Ri^ht Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of fctate
for the Colonies, and Sir William Har
court, the leader of the opposition in the
House, were greeted with prolonged cheers
as they entered the chamber.
After tie Queen's speech had been read
by the Speaker, Viscount Folkestone, mem
ber of the south division of Wiltshire,
moved the address in reply to the speech
from the in rone, and in the course of bia
remarks refeired to the approaching com
pletion of the siTiie-h year ol ilie reign of
her ilajesty Queen Victoria, and ex
pressed the hope that the event, so unique
in the annals of the country, would be
fittingly celebrated.
yir Will-am Marcourt said the most im
portant as well as the most satislactory
statement contained in the Queen's speech
related to the relations between Great
Britain and the United States. He heart
ily congratulated the Government on the
conclusion of the differences between
Venezuela and Great Britain, and pave
them unstinted credit lor the general
arbitration treaty â¢vhich was signed by
the British Enibassador at Washington
and the Secretary of State. i
Sir William Harcotirt, continuing hisj
remarks, said there could not be a better
celebration of the sixtieth year of her
Majesty's reign tban that her Govern
ment sbould be among tne first of nations
to<-ettbe example of settJin? differences*
by arbitration. He denounced the Nile
campaign and asked tbe Government to
justify their Egyptian policy. In regard
to Armenia he was glad to hear that the
Govi'rnnv nt had abandoned hostility to
Russia in the mailer.
Prime Minister Salisbury said he re
gretted Lord Roserjery's tetirement from
the leadership of the Liberal party for the
moment. He paid a high tribute to Lord
RoseDery's patriotic poiicy, as shown in
his speecii upon the occasion of his retire
ment, and tnen proceeded to defend the
consistent Dolicy of the Conservatives.
The Government, he declared, had not
initiated the anti-Russian policy of 1878.
It was the Crimean war that initiated it,
but the powers were now generally agreed
that if reforms were not granted in
Armenia material pressure would be
applied to the Sultan by the rest of
Europe. There were but slightly different
wordings, he said, in thedeclarationsol t' c
powers in regard, to the way it should be
â lone, but all of them were convinced that
unless the Sultan should introduce
genuine and effective reforms the worst
rssuits must follow.
In regard to tbe Nile campaign the
Premier said that Dongola was taken be
cause it was on the route to Khartoum,
which place must eventnally be taken
from the dervishes. He reported that it
was the intention of the British Govern
ment to reconquer Soudan for Egypt.
In regard to the treaty of arbitration
just cone uaei with the United States, he
said he could not speak fully on the sub
ject because the agreement had not yet
been ratified, still he would say that the
people must not think that they were liv
ing In the millennial dispensation. He
hoped, however, that something would be
done to diminish tbe risk of war. He
would not say that the treaty would not
remove the greatest risks of war, or re
strain a Napoleon, or a Bismarck, but the
policy with the United States was full of
an infinite number of small differences,
which sometimes exaggerated caused irri
tation and enmity. The formation of a
tribunal of arbitration would settle these
d.llicuitie3, would prevent such and show
the two nations who understood each
other so well that unless they are friends
thpy are almost certain to be ene
mi-s. Another advantage would be de
rived from the treaty in this respect:
A Minister dealing with a subject in
volving tne honor of this country, or
which some persons claim involves its
honor, has to think how to furnish an ac
count of the transaction which will soothe
the jingoes. Arbitration would De a bnl>
wark lor such a Minister, for it would be
impossible to say he had trifled with the
honor of the country if he said he had
submitted the matter to the decision of
au impartial tribunal.
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 20, 1597.
MAYOR PHELAN ADDRESSES THE ASSEMBLED MERCHANTS-
CHECKS TACTICS
OF HUNTINGTON.
Laegford's Bill Proposes to
Amend the Civil
Cede.
It Will Give New Railroads a
I Chance to Secure Needed
Fights of Way.
'lines Such as tbe Valley Road May
, Build luring the Pending of
Condemnation Suits.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 19.â While
the Senate never runs the risk of over-ex
nrtion, its sessions never extending be
yond an hour and a half, it broke the rec
ord for slow racing to-day. Seven bills
weie read the second time, and twenty
two new bills were introduced.
Beyond question the most important
measure submitted by Senator Langford
to-day was a bill amending sections 1254
and 1257 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
relative to condemnation of private prop
erty for public use, or the right of eminent
domain, as it is termed legally.
This measure is in the interest of the
Sierra Pacitic Railway, and is aimed at the
Southern Pacific Company's efforts to
place obstructions in the way of the build
ing of this road from Stockton into the
heart of the mother lode, about fifty miles
from that city. It will not only tend to
defeat the machinations of the Southern
Pacific Company against this particular
road, but will also doubtless greatly aid
the Valley road's efforts to secure rights
of way, and will bo a protective measure
for all future similar enterprises.
Senator Langford introduced the billon
the request of the attorneys interested
with the Sierra Pacific Railway Company.
In a let cr to the Senator explaining the
scope and object of the proposed amend
ments occurs the following:
"If we can pass this act the Southern
Pacific Company will be unable to cut us
off hereafter in our rights of way, for the
sections, an amended, provide lor the tak
ing Of possession of the land before the
rinal judgment in the condemnation tu!t.
* â¢ * I am satisfied that there is no
constitutional objection to the amend
ments as sent, and la the interest ot Cali
fornia it should be passed. * * * Had
the amendments which we now propose
been the law at. tbe time we commenced
operations with the Sierra Pacific Rajjway
Company we would not have been com
pelled to change our base of operations."
Following is the full text of the pro
posed amendments:
Section 1254. At any time after the filing of
the complaint, and the Issuance and service of
the summons thereon, the court may, upon
notice to the defendant by the said court, by
an order In that behalf made, authorize the
plaintiff, if already in possession and use, to
continue in the possession and use, and if not
In possession, to taice possession of and use the
land aud premises sought to be condemned
during the pendency and until the final con
clusion of the proceeding brought to condemn
the same, and may stay all actions and pro
ceedings against such plaintiff on account
thereof; provided, however, that in and by said
order said plaintiff shall be ordered to pay,
and thereafter and before the taking of such
possession, or of the further continuance
in possession of any such land and
premises, pay a sufficient sum of money
into court, or give security for the payment
thereof, to be approved by the Judge of such
court, to compensate said defendant for all
damages which may be sustained by said de
fendant by reason of such proceedings, or of
any such condemnation, provided the ' con
demnation shall be finally had of the said
land and prcmlsu*, together with nil dÂ»m-i!;> .-*
which may be sustained by the saiil defend
ant, if the said proceedings for said condemna
tion shall finally fail, or If for any cause the
said land and premises shall not be taken for
the public use for which the same is sought to
be condemned, and upon the- deposit of the
said money, or upon the giving of such secur
ity, os ordered by the court, the said plaintiff,
by the said order of the said court, shall be
let into the possession and u-e of snia land
and premises- sought to be condemned, or
be continued in the poÂ«-ession and use
thereof, in the same manner and to the
same effect as the sidd plaintiff would be en
titled after the trial of Mich proceedings, and
the entry of final judgment therein; except
that the richt of said plaintiff to retain such
possession and to use paid land and premises
shall be determined by said final judgment,
and in case of a refusal of the defendant, upon
the order of said court, to allow the said
p'.aintitf to enter into the possession and use
of said land and premises, or any part thereof,
the said court, upon application of said
plaintiff, shall issue a writ of assistance of the
same force and effect as writs of assistance are
issued in other cases, in whfch writs of assist
ance are issuable, which said writ shall be
executed by the Sheriff of the county wherein
the said land and premises maybe situated,
witnout delay.
The defendant, who is entitled to the said
money paid into conrt, as aforesaid, or upon
any judgment in such proceedings, shall be
entited to demand and receive the same at
any time thereafter upon obtaining an order
therefor from the court. It shall be the duty of
the court, upou application being made by
such defendant, to order and direct that the
money so paid luto conrt be delivered to him
upon his filing a satisfaction of the judg
ment or upon filing his receipt therefor, and
an abandonment of all defense* to the action
or proceeding, except as to the amount of
damages that he may be entitled to in the
event that a new trial shall be granted. A
payment to a defendant, as aforesaid, shall be
held to be an abandonment by such defendant
of all defenses interposed by him, excepting
his claim for greater compensation. In ascer
taining the amount to be paid into court, the
court shall take care that the same be sufficient
and adequate. The payment of the
money into court, as hereinbefore provided
for, shall not discharge the plaintiff from
liability to keep the fund full and without
diminution, but such money shall he and re
main, as to all accidents, defalcations or other
contingencies (as between the parties to the
proceedings), at the risk of the plaintiff and
shall so remain until the amour/t of the com
pensation or damages Is finally settled by judi
cial determination ana until the court awards
the money or such part thereof as shall be de
termined upon to the defendant, and untii he
is authorized or required by order of court to
take it. If, for any reason, me money shall at
any time be lost or otherwise abstracted or
withdrawn, througn no fault of the defendant,
the court shall require the plaintiff to make;
and keep the sum good at all timÂ«s until the
litigation Is Jinelly brought to au end and
until paid over or made payable to the de
fendant by order of court, as above provided,
and until such time or times the County Clerk
shall be deemed to be the custodian of the
money, and shall be liable to the plaintiff
upon his official bond for \he same, or
on any purt thereof, in case it be
for any reason lost or otherwise abstracted or
withdrawn. The court, however, may order
the money to be deposited iii the State treas
ury, and in such case if shall b^ the duty of
the Btate Treasurer to receive all such moneys,
duly receipt for, i ni safely keep the same in a
special iund to be enccred upon his books as a
condemnation fund for such purpose, aud for
such duty he shall be liable to the plaintiff
upon his official bond. The State Treasurer
shall pay out such money so deposited in such
manner and at such times as the court may by
order direct, in all ease* where a new trial
has been granted upon the application of the
defendant utid he has failed upon such trial
to obtain greater compensation than was al
lowed Him upon the first, trial, the costs of
such new trial shall be taxed against him.
Sec. 1257. The provisions of part II of this
code relative to new trials and appeals, except
in so far as they are inconsistent with the pro
visions of this title, apply to the proceedings
mentioned in this title, provided that upon
the payment of the sum of money assessed,
and upou the execution of the bond, to build
the fences and cattle guards, as provided in
section 1251, the plaintiff shall be entitled to j
enter into, improve and hoid possession of the j
property sought to be condemned, if not
already in possession, or shall have been let
into the possession and use therec f, as pro
vided in section 1254, and devote the same to
the public use in question; and no motion for
, b iu'W Â»rl&? or ftppi-.a) shall, tiftersueh payment
and tiling of such bond as aforesaid, in any
manner retard the contemplated improve
ment. Any money which shall have been de
posited,"as provided in section 1254, may bo
applied to the payment of the money assessed,
I and the remainder, if any there be, shall be
returned to the plaintiff.
This act shall take effect immediately.
Here is the bill which, if passed, will re
duce the terms of ell county officers to two
years. Judging from the expression heard
with reference to it to-day it is likely to
never r. appear from the committee to
which it is referr-d:
All elective county and township officers,
except otherwise provided for in this act,
shall be elected at the general election to be
: held in November, 1898, and every two years
i thereafter, unless otherwise herein provided,
and shall take office at 12 o'clock m. on the
first Monday after the first day of January
next succeeding their election. Supervisors
shall be elected as hereinbefore provided. All
officers ejected under the provisions of this act
shall hold office until their successors are
elected or appointed and qualified.
This act shall take effect immediately.
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY.
Joint Jtetolutlont on Hit Nicaragua
< turn I Are Adopted.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 19.â 1n the
Senate this mornine the proceedings were
of a routine character. A majority of the
Committee on Finance reported against
the Braunhart resolution for the free coin
age of silver, The Democratic minority,
reported in its favor. ' It was then placed
on file for further consideration.
Among the bills introduced was one by
Feeney forbidding employes of sleeping
car companies making up upper berths
unless for actual occupants, under $500
penalty.
Manoney introduced a bill against deal
ing in options. Adjourned for the day.
In the Assembly to-day Bridgford's irri
gation bill was passed to engrossment.
Dibble made a motion, agreed upon in
the Republican caucus, to recommit the
majority and miuority reports on Duck
worth to the Committee on Attaches.
Keegan, who made the minority report,
protested and demanded immediate
action.
Dibble's motion was adopted by a party
vote.
The House went into committee of the
whole upon a bill reported yesterday ap
propriating $75,000 /or the Slate Printing
Office for the present fiscal year.
Guy moved, according to the directions
of the Republican raucus last nieht, to
reduce it to $30,000. At the same time
Guy said $75,000 would be needed, but he
thought it wiser to appropriate only a
smaller amount now. After a partisan
delate in the committee of the whole the
bill was amended and made special order
for to-morrow.
The Senate joint resolutions on the
Nicaragua canal were adopted, after vot
ing down a substitute offered by Shana
hnn.
Caroinetti's resolutions, adopted yester

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 19.â After
a session of half a day both houses ad
journed until to-morrow morning in or
der to allow the committees an oppor
tunity of meeting and consi 'ering the va
rious bills now before them. Bills are
coming in very slowly from the printer,
and the reason given is that the State
office is short of funds. State Printer
Johnson has asked for a $75,000 appropria
tion, but the legislators thorn-lit that tte
demand was too high. The matter was
taken, up In the Assembly to-day, and it
was decided to allow an appropriation of
$40,000. The State Printer says that this
sum is inadequate, and he ought to know.
The Senate will have to concur in the ap
propriation or will reduce or raise it. In
the meantime committees are clamoring
for more bills, but the stream of printed
paper from the big white building is very
sluggish and very shailow.
Democrats and Republicans alike are
crying aloud for retrenchment, and it has
been agreed that the first movement of
that direction will be toward the abolition
of the CoJe Commission by refusing to al
low any appropriation for its maintenance.
It is expected that such action on the
l art of the Legis'ature will sneedily place
the commission in that deiigntful state
of careless repose known to Hirdoo mys
tics as Nirvana. Democrats will regret
that the ax of econornv and reform will
first fall on the necks of three persona!
iriends and appointees of Governor Budci,
and sympathetic but eqnally economical
Republicans will mingle their tears with
those of their free trade brethren.
Private Secretary McCabe, who enjoys a
salary of $4000 per annum, is a shin ne
mark for the ax, and it is understood that
a bill will be introduced to cut his salary
down to $2500. There are a whole lot of
other appointees of the Governor in vari
ous State institutions now trembling in
their shoes and spending their pin money
in telegrams to friends in both nouses to
look out for their interests and not allow
this wild cry for retrenchment to make
them deaf, dumb and blind to the fact
tnat a reduction of salaries would tend to
impair the efficiency of tho3e institution*.
The reformers seem to be earnest in this
matter, and the Republicans are as utual
in the front, so thai the battle of retrench
ment wilt be on by next week, and a fierce
battle it will be indeed.
Many legislator?, perhaps a majority,
are terrified at tiie bulk of the report of
Code Commissioner-. It is said to con
tain about 900 amendments to codes,
wbicb speaks well lor tie industry of the
Commissioners and of Judge Daly in par

Your memorialists, citizens of Cali

Congress will enact the â  .Nicaragua

For many years our Government has

cial bodies of the City and by many repre
sentative business men.
A number of speeches were made ad
vising the completion of an American
canal between oceans as one of the most
advantageous Government works for the
development of the whole Pacific Coast.
It was a quiÂ«t, dign tied assemblage of
thoughtful business men. There were
several hundreds of them all standing
closely together upon the open floor. Tho
chairman of the meeting and the secre
tary stood upon an elevated counter, and
from that position addressed the meeting,
which was short and business-like, but
spirited.
President Hugh Craig of the Chambor
of Commerce' made the opening address.
"The canal," he said, "will ba vvorih to
the citizens of San Francisco and to the
people of the Pacific Coast millions and
millions of dollars. I have a telegram
from Sacramento saying that the Assem
bly bas just passed the resolutions offered
by our own Senator in regard to tha
canal."
Mayor James D. Phelan said: "The
only opposition to the canal would come
from the transcontinental railroads,
which are not of great interest Â»o us.
There can be no question among the
citizens or the merchants of San Francisco

Irving M. Scott, in offering the adoption
of the resolutions printed above, said:
"This is only one move in the direction of
making San Francisco the great distribu
ting point of the Pacific Coast. The com
pletion of the Nicaragua Canal will do
more than fifty years of talk in the bast.
I hope that the Chamber of Commerce
will aaopt this resolution that we may
consummate the work which will so
greatly develop the resources of our City
and State."
Wlien the motion was pot the resolu
tion was unanimously adopted by tne as
semblage.
John T. Doyle spoke next He Baid:
"I went down to Nicaragua and stayed a
year in the employ of a company organ
ized many years ago. Tue - canal then
projected was much smaller and less ex
pensive than the present one. The figure
was placed at $26,000,000. The negotia
tion was declined by English bankers be
cause they thought the whole result of tne
canal would be to further the commerce
of tha Pacific Coast. I move that this
meeting send a telegram to Speaker Reed
of the House of Representatives, who is
the chief man to act for us in this case."
Captain W. L. Merry, secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce, then addreising
'he meeting said, in part:
"We have suffered from an arrested de
velopment. When the canal is open we
will rind European steamers bringing
their products into San Francisco. This
country will, it snail, see the canal built.
Seventy-seven and a half per cent of the
stock of this canal belongs to three gov
ernments.
"Seventy per cent belongs to the United
States, 6 per cent to Nicaragua and lU' per
cent to Costa Rica. Only 2V/, percent be
longs to the canal company. The com
pany has only one director out of eleven.
Under tliose conditions the company can
do no harm to the people of the United
States."
The following resolutions were read and
adopted with applause:
Resolved, That the people of the Pacific Coast
owe a debt of gratitude to our fellow-citizen,
Wiiliam L. Merry, for his untiring, persistent
efforts to promote ' its prosperity and the com
mercial interests of our country by his able ad
vocacy of the Nicaragnan canal. May he live to
witness the fruition of his hopes in witnessing
the American flag passing between the oceans
at the peak ol American steamships laden with
the products of our Pacific Coast. As the
pioneer commercial advocate of the Nica
ragua canal, we render him the thanks of his
fellow-citizens.
Well done thou good and faithful servant.
Resolved, That copie* of this resolution be
forwarded to the California delegation in Con
gress.
A communication from the Geological
Society of the Pacific was read expressing
hearty approval of any Congressional
efforts to be undertaken for the accom
plishment of the purpose of completing
the Nicaragua canal. This commumca*
tion was signed by Professor George
Davidson, president of the society.
The following telegrams were sent on to

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 19.â During
the morning hour in the Senate to-day a
large number of private pension bills were
reported from the Committee on Pensions
and placed on the calendar.
Senate bill to provide for organizing a
naval battalion in the District of Colum
bia was passed.
House bill to incorporate the Conven
tion of American Instructors of the Deaf
was reported from the Committee on the
District of Columbia and passed.
House bill to confirm certain cash en
tries of public lands (invalid by reason of
a teennical omission) was taken from the
calendar and passed.
The resolution heretofore offered by
Morgan (D.) of Alabama v directing the
Judiciary Committee to inquire and re
port as to the default of the Pacific Rail
road Company and payment of bonds,
was laid before the Seuate, and on the
suggestion of Morgan the resolution went
over for the present.
A resolution offered yesterday by Petti
gr?w (silverite) of South Dakota was also
laid before the Senate, and went over un
til to-morrow at the request of Pettigrew.
Senate joint resolution relating to the
laying of electric subways in the District
of Columbia was taken up, and was op
posed by Hill (D.)of New York, who char
acterized it as "most extraordinary" and
asserted that it was in the interest of a
monopoly tnat bad the ear of some of the
Senate committees. Hill summed up his
speech by declaring that it was a fight be
tween two electric-light companies, one
of which had got the ear of the District
Committee while the other had not. The
resolution was virtually a confiscation of
property and the money of the new com
pany, which was largely represented in
the city of New York.
He spoke for an hour and a half, thus
occupying all the time that had been left
for morning business. At the conclusion
of his speech the resolution went back to
the calendar, and at 2 p. m. the Nicaragua
canal bill was taken up as the unfinished
business.
Turpie (D.) of Indiana made a speech
against the bill. He began by saying:
Tne opposition to this bill is not founded on
hostility to a canal on the isthmian route.
I We are in favor of an isthmian canal under
American control and under the control of
the President and the Congress of this great
Republic.
An Isthmian canal is a great design, worthy
of the Senate and this Government. It prom
ises to remove the Straits of Magellan thous
ands of miles to the north ; to erase from the
ocean sailing chart the tedious voyage around
the Horn ; to sever and divide this grand divi
sion of the earth's surface, North and South
America, and yet to make them more adjacent
âto wed them in closer union and to make a
more kindly tie between them than everbefore.
The consummation of this enterprise, so
long desired, so iong expected, meets the favor
of every statesman in every country of the
world within the. bounds of civilization. It is
because we favor, earnestly favor, the con
struction and completion of the isthmian
canal by the Nicaraguan route that we are
opposed to letting it go into the hands of a
Erivate corporation, the beneficiary of this
ill â an Insolvent corporation, without money,
without credit, whose connection with this
I great enterprise must assuredly lead to dis
astrous defeat
Turpie went on to describe, in pictur
esque language, the failure of the Mari
time Canal Company of Nicaragua to ob
tain financial support in Europe. He
also recalled the history of tne Panama
canal scheme, which, he said, had not
had the support of any capitalists or of
any governments, but had drawn $240,
--000,000 in a giand levy from the petty
tradesmen and peasants of France.
He also called attention to the provision
inserted in the original charter of incor
poration from the Maritime Canal Com
pany of Nicaragua, and without which, he

said, tfce company never would have been
incorporated.
That provision was that nothing in the
act should be construed as to commit tne
United States to any pecuniary liability
whatever for any debts or liabilities of
the company. If that was not a conclu
sive estoppel at law and in eqaity against
the demands of an appropriation of a
hundred million dollars the English lan
guage could not frame one.
HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.
I'rivaie I'enaion Hills Considered in
Committee of the Hhole.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 19.â 8y the

under consideration, and it fl'as postponed
until a more auspicious occasion. Upon
the reading of the title Milnes (R.) of
Michigan announced that since that f.me
the proposed beneficiary of the bill had
died, and he therefore moved that the bill
lie on the table, which was done.
In the course of the afternoon the army
appropriation bili was received from the
Senate and proceedings under the order
were suspended Jong enough for the pur
pose of adopting a motion to disagree to
the Senate amendment and a^ree to a
conference thereon. Messrs. Hull (R. ) of

Clellan (D.) of New York were named as
conferees.

Assemblyman Treacy of San Francisco
ha 3 introduced a substitute for Senator
Brannhart'a bill, reducing the fares on
street railroads to 2}4 cents bstween the
hours of 6 and 8 in the morning and 5 and
7 in the evening, not more than sixty of
such commutation tickets to be sold to
any one person. Mr. Treacy'3 substitute
contains the following essential which
has been omitted in the Braunhart bill:
"The privilege of transfer to all branch
lines belonging to the same system or
other railroads existing on the Ist day of
January, 1897, must in no wise be abridged
or impaired by reason of the provisions of
this act."
With this exception the bill is substan
tially the same as that introduced into the
Senate by Braunhart. Tne voting ma
chine has arrived. It is a box about
three and a half feet long by a foot and a
half wide and is operated by springs and
weights, there being no electrical device
connected with it. The machine on ex
hibition contains 100 names, but it can be
made to contain 1000 if necessary and its
cost is about $2 per name. A copy of the
ballot is displayed qpder a glass pane at
the top of the box. Opposite each name
is a metal plug with the corresponding
number. When the votor wishes to cast
his ballot for John Doe for Auditor he
presses down the plug bearing John Doe's
number.
At the same instant a bell rings, show
ing that the vote has been recorded, and
the plug, and those for the other candi
dates for Auditor become automatically
locked so that they cannot be voted until
released by the judge of election who pulls
a knob and rings a bell, setting the
machine in readiness for the next voter.
Each vote is automatically registered on
numbered wheels and printed on white
slips of paper.

iculture) Senator Wolfe appeared on be
half of the appropriation for $10,000 to
make an exhibit of the products and man
ufactures of California to the Guatemala
exhibition. His efforts proved successful
and the matter was favorably referred to
the Committee on Finance, which will
also, it is believed, net favorably on the
matter.
Sacramento's cemetery is not to be

Finance to-day.
Three of the Senate committees will
each send a delegation of three, including
the chairman of each committee, on a
tour of the State to visit and inspect all
public institutions except State prisons.
They will start on their journey a weeK
from Thursday. The committees repre
sented will be hospitals, public buildings
and finance. A resolution will be intro
duced granting them permission to go ami

heretofore.
SANTA CLARA'S CHA,PION.
Aiaemblyman Arnerich Zookinq Afttr
the County* Interest*.
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. Jan. 19.â One of
the most, conspicuous members of the
Assembly, and one who is doing and will
do much effective legislation in a quiet
way, 13 Mati E. Arner'ch, the giant wine
grower of Santa Clara Connty. Mr. Arne
rich stands several inches above 6 feet in
height, is dark eyed, rosy cheeked and
brown skinned, a typical representative of
the sturdy Culifornian horticulturist. He
is the owner of the Lone Hill vineyard of
100 acres, mostly in wine grapes, and of
100 acres of farming land which he culti
vates in various products for his own use.
He also raises prunes, walnuts, figs, etc.,
for the market, manufactures his grape
crop into wine, ana is a Jiving illustration
of the thrifty, industrious farmer.
Alhough this is the first time that Mr.
Arnerich has ever held any political office
he takes lo the duties of his position as
naturally as a duck takes to water, and
has already introduced several very meri
torious bills. Among these is Assembly
bill No 353, which prohibits a husband or
wife from testifying against the other
without the other's consent. He takes
most interest in the bill to provide a third
Snperlor Judge Tor Santa Clara County.
"The calendars of the two courts," said
Mr. Arnemich to-day, "are choked up
and Dlockea with cases. Both conns are
now a year behind, and litigants must
wait for that length of time before they
can have their oases taken up. It is
necessary that we should have the third
Judge because the people of Santa Ciara
demand, it." He adde4 that he would de
vote all his time and' energy in pushing
the bill through to its passage.
The Committee on Judiciary has now
under consideration Assembly bill 192,
which provides for the giving of bonds by
the keepers of intelligence oftices, defin
ing the same and their liabilities. The
bill reads as follows:
Section 1. Every person, firm or corporation
now carrying on or conducting the business

lently represented by said obligor or agency,
and also that execution upon any judgment

shall immediately notify, in writing, by mail,
the obligor in such bond to file, within twenty
days, a new bond in said penal sum, with sure
ties, to be approved by a Superior Judge of
said county, or ciiy and county, as in article I
of th is act is provided.
Sec. 3. Upon the recovery of any judgment
in any court of competent jurisdiction,

proved bond required by the section 1 of this
act.
Sec. 5. Any person who shall conduct or

ations for an employe, or any person or per

tion by the committee on commissions,

IRRIGATION PROBLEMS.
They Wtll Hecrive Attention by the Leg
iÃlnture.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 19.âIrriga
tion problems promise to absorb consider
able of the time and attention of the Leg
islature this session, and the already be
whiskered conflict is likely to be renewed
with vigor and venom, and the more so
that the last session almost entirely ig
nored the questiun. All the repressed
sentiment is now at boiling point and the
opportunity that is to be given every one
to be heard on Thursday nieht will be
taken advantage of with avidity.
The effect of the W:ight law has appar
ently been radically different in the vari
ous sections of the State. While the ex
treme southern counties, or at least their
representatives in the Legislature, such as
Senator Withington and Assemblyman
Linden berper, seem to be satisfied with
the operation, the counties of the San Joa
quin and Sacramento valleys are sorrow
ing and waiiing over the hardships said
to have been engendered by it, ana are
carving out for reformation of tne bill.
In the Modesto and Turlock districts
the situation is repreÂ»ented as being par
ticularly onerous. The burdens of taxa
tion under the Wright law, it is claimed,
have become so heavy that the people are
willing to forego all the benefits and ad
vantages of the expenditure cf about
$1,500,000, and to waive all claims to the
rights and property acquired with this
money, if they are relieved from any
further obligation in connection with the
construction and maintenance of irriga
tion systems under the Wright law.
C. W. Eaton o. f Modesto, who made
quite a stir at the joint meeting of the
Senate and Asserubiy committees last
night, is here net only to endeavor to se
cure amendments to the Wright act, but
to secure, if possible, the passage of a
special act permitting the transfer of the
property and rights of the Modesto and
Turlonk irrigation districts to private par
ties for cjrtain considerations. This, he
explained, was desired by the taxpayers of
the districts, who were being taxed to the
poiut of de^itu'. ion under present condi
tions! and who wanted to be rid of their
"old man of the sea."
In the town of Modsto, he said, the
owner of a large brick business block
in the heart of the city, had decided to
forfeit this property rather than pay any
further irrigation taxes. He is reported
as saying he could not stand any further
assessment. Eaton claims that in the
country the situation is even much more
NEW TO-DAY.

aggravated. Eaton complained that there
was no redress at law, and the people in
those districts were in a most pitiable con
dition. He added that many bad seen
what was coming, had sold their holdings
and had left for parts where the fallacy of
the irrigation district fad had not reached.
His story of the relief it is proposed to
seek ys a remarkable one.
R. W. Gorrill, president of the Bond As
sociation, which control? about $1,200,000
worth of bonds in the Modesto and Tur
locK districts, has made a proposition to
surrender all the bonds the association
holds, providing the districts will turn
over all their property and rights to the
Bond Association. Certain other condi
tions are also imposeJ. These are that
the irrisration districts pay up all back
taxes, all debts of the district, satisfy all
suits and judgments and guarantee all
rightf! of way necessary for the canal sys
tems, and the sale of water to irrigate
15,000 acres of land in each district at a
cost of $2 50 per acre per year.
A mass-meeting of the taxpayers was
held and a committee was appointed to
carry on negotiations with the associa
tion. This committee, after due investi
gation of the matter, submitted an
answer to the bond association statins;
that all the terms were satisfactory, ex
cept the required guarantee for rights of
way and for water contracts. And here
the matter rests at this writing.
In discussing the question with a
prominent attorney in ban Francisco the
question of the right of the people of the
irrigation districts to transfer property
in the hands of public corporations to pri
vate corporations came up, and the at
torney expressed the opinion that such a
right did not exist. If such a transfer
was desired legislative sanction would
first have to be secured. It is to accom
plish this purpose that a special bill may
be introduced, and then the lur will fly.
THREE ELECTION CONTESTS.
Attorneys Appunr Before the Senate
Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 19.â Three
flection contests were on the card 'for the
Senate Committee on Elections to-night.
Thomas W. Chandler (R.) claims the seat
of John Feeney (D.); M. J. Wtelcb (regu
lar Republican) that of Kidney Hall, and
John G. Tyrrell (the Kelly : Mahoney
nominee) also contests the seat of Hall.
Frank H. Powers is the attorney for
Chandler, Martin Stevens for Welch, A.
Ruef for Tyrrell and Garret W. McErier
ney for both Feeney and Hall.
The only one to appear on behalf of any
of the parties directly interested when the
committee was called to order by Chair
man Stratton was McEnerney. The lat
ter was asked to present im sida of the
case pending the arrival of the opposing
attorneys, who were expected on the train
due here from San Francisco at 8 p. m.,
but declined to do so, on the ground that
the other side might oppose such a pro
ceeding. It was then decided to await
the arrival of expected legal lights.
At 8:30 p. m. Reuf came in and declared
himself ready to go on with the case of
Tyrrell against Hall. McEnerney stated
that matters would be expedited by hear
ing both cases against Hall together. Ow
ing to the absence of Stevens, however, it
was decided to go on with the case of
Tyrrell against Hall.
Ruef opened the cfse by explaining that
at the election held la* t November in the
Twenty-third Senatorial District Hall re
ceived 1670 votes, Tyrrell 1660 and Welch
1630, according to the official returns. He
added that the semi-official returns showed
Tyrrell's election by a plurality of 19
votes, which result accorded exactly with
the li.'ures gathered by the messengers
sent out on the night of the election to
every precinct by Mr. Tyrrell. He next
reviewed at length the testimony taken by
depositions and submitted last week to the
committee.
Euef, instead of confining bimself to ar
gument, as was expected, quoted testi
mony at great lencih. Chairman Strat
ton finally could stand the waste of time
no longer and asked him to be easy on the
committee. He promised to do so, but
bad to be again called to time by tbe chair
man, after he had exceeded his limit by
fifteen minutes. He begged for five min
utes additional and was granted this con
cession. He spoke another fifteen min
utes before McEnerney got his inning.
The latter took his half-hour, and Ruef
concluded the argument. Tbe Tyrreli-
Hall case was then submitted and the
hearing of the other two cases was set
tor Thursday at 1:30 p. m.
On Budd's Recommendations.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 19.â The
Senate Finance Committee to-day consid
ered the recommenda'ions in the Gov
ernor's message relating to income tax
from corporations and the excise or liqnor
license. It was decided to refer these sub
jects to a sub-committee for further con
sideration. The committee will hear rep
resentatives of the Board of University
Regents to-morrow evening. The univer
sity asks for an additional 1-cent tax,
which exactly doubles the present allow
ance. '
The joint Committee on Elections de
cided this evenin* to refer all the primary
election bills to a joint sub-committee.

Daring Attack Made Upan
Tapaste, Province of
Havana.
Spaniard?, However, Defended
the Pace Until the Rebels
Retired.
Fierce Fighting in the Streets of
Placetas in Which Many
Soldiers Are Slain.
HAVANA, Cvba, Jan. 19.â The news
papers here now give complete details of
an attack made by rebels upon Tapaste.
province of Havana. The tight occurred
on January 10 and the fact that the news
of the engagement has been so long sup
pressed is taken to indicate a Spanish
defeat.
The newspapers state under Govern
ment permission that wben the insurgents
attacked the town, the residents took
refuge in a church. The Spanish defended
the place for four hours, until the rebels
retired. No mention is made of losses on
either side.
Further details are at hand of the recent
rebel attack upon Placetas, in the prov
ince of Santa Clara. Tha rebeli entered
the town from different directions, they
crossed the line of forts and attacked sev
eral houses. Liter there was fierce fight
ing in the stieets, which lasted for theee
hours, when the rebels were driven out of
the town.
The insurgents left six of their number
dead in the streets. The garrison had six
teen men wounded. One woman resident
was killed and three male citizens and a
child were wounded. Nineteen persons
in the town have beeu arrested on the
charge of having b.-en implicated in the
attack.
ONE MORE CONCESSION.
Spain Aof Tet in a Mood to Vex Vncle
Aim.
NEW YORE, N. V., Jan. 19.â A
Tribune special from Washington says:
Trie Spanish Government has decided to
accede to another demand from this coun
try. The demand was that excessive
charges against American vessels which
had visited Cuban ports should be re
turned and more justice be shown in the
future. This is the third important con
cession made by Spain within the last
three months in reply to somewhat vigor
ous protests from the State Department.
She nrst granted a civil trial to Sanguilly,
who had been condemned to death by a
military trbunal. She next accorded to
the Competitor's crew a rehearing before
another court.
The protest mad c in behalf o! American
vessels trading with Cuban ports was sent
to Madrid about two months ago. It
pointed out that at Havana particularly
ship* plying between that place and, Â«wrts
of this country had been unjustify dis
criminated against in many instances. * In
some cases fines were imposed against the
vessels for alleged infractions of harbor
regulations. In others the manifests were
inaccurate^ registered. Secretary Olney,
addressing Minister Taylor, urged that
prompt representation be made to Spain
thai the treatment of the ship 3of this
country in Cuoan waters appeared from
authentic reports to be such as to warrant
the demand that in instances wiiicb he
specifically pointed out there should be a
restitution of certain sums of money to
ship-owners.
Reports which reached the State De
partment before the protest was sent to
Taylor showed that on frequent occasions
American captains had to pay fines im
posed by officials at Havana, which was
excessive as well as unjust on other
grounds. The captains for a time paid
these, but as the assessments increased in
amount and frequency they finally ap
pealed to Consul-General Lee, who in due
course laid their cases before tne State
Department.
It appears from the evidence that the
American captains learned that tbe com
manders of other foreign ships touching
at Havana were not required to pay sucn
heavy fines or penalties for the same kind
of offenses as alleged in their cases. They
asserted that the Havana officials had
heretofore discrimated against them.
Consul-General L<ee examined a number
of complaints of this character and de
cided that they were well founded.
Minister Taylor has informed the State
Department that, pursuant to his instruc
tions, he laid the matter before the Span
ish Foreign Office. He represented the
case to be one calling for prompt and
favorable action. He also called the at
tention of the Foreign Minister to the im
portance of issuing directions to the
Havana officials that American vessels
touching at that port should not be dis
criminated against.
A few days ago the Duke of Tetuan took
action favorable to the American claim.
To the American captaina who have just
cause for complaint of excessive duties the
difference between the sums they paid
and that which ought to have been paid
were refunded. Proper instructions will
be sent to the Havana officials as to their
future course with American ships.
DENOUNCES THE PROSECUTION.
Herr lAtnhura Creatrtt a lircze in the
PrvnÂ»inn Landtag.
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 19.â 1n the
Chamber of Deputies in the Prussian
Landtag to-day Herr Limburg denounced
the prosecution of Baron yon Luetzow,
the journalist, who on December 7 w^s
sentenced to seventeen months' imprison
ment for libeling Baron Marshal Biecer
stein, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count
Yon Eulemberg and Prince Alexander
yon HohenJone, and also for confessed
lorgery and perjury.
Prince Hohenlohe, Imperial Chancellor,
defended the action of the authorities in
prosecuting Luetzow as being absolutely
necessary, ana declared the trial of Major
yon Tausch, the former chief of the
political police, who is now in jail, undp.r
charges of forgery and perjury, would
show that Baron Marschall yon Bieber
stein had acted in complete harmony
with the other Ministers. The remarks
of the chancellor were received with
cheers by the members of the Left and
Center.
STEEL- RAIL PLANT SCHTDOWN.
twelve Hundred Workmen Out for an
Indefinite Period.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 19.â The steel-rail
plant at the South Chicago works of the
Illinois Steel Company was closed to-day
for an indefinite period. Twelve hundred
workmen who came to the mill this morn
ing for their usual work were surprised to
find the notice pov,ed on the big gates.
The cut in the working forces of the com
pany follows a readjustment of wages of
all skilled workmen, resulting iv a de
crease of from 10 to 30 per cent.
Regarding tne shutdown to-day, Presi
dent John W. Gates said: "The reason is
merely that tie orders received do not
justify us in continuing in turning out
rails. The other departments will not be
affected and there will be no other change
in the wages at present."
SUGUR, CONFFEE AND SPICE.
Wool son Cnmiinny J-'iU* an AnsWrr to
the Arbuekl**' >nÂ«f.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Jan. 19.â The sugar
trust and directors of the Woolaon Spice
Company to-day filed an answer in the
suit begun a week asjo by the Arbuckles
asking for a receiver for the concern. The
chief defense is that the Arbuckles did
hot purchase their sixty shares of stock as
an investment and in good faith, but that
they were simply bent upon annoying the
present owners of tha plant. It is denied
.hat the Woolson plant is being operated
at aloÂ«s, but on the coutrary, it is asserted
that the profits are irom $500 to $700 per
day, notwithstanding the recent cuts in the
price of coffee. It is also denied that the
entire board of directors has resigned or
will not be re-elected at the next meet
ing of stockholders, which would have
occurred to-day but lor the temporary in
junction granted last week. The case will
oe heard on its merits on January 25.

The First Xatio*Â»l Bnnh Accepted,
Orpoait.t Up to the Close.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Jan. 19.â The First
National Bank, which closed its doors
yesterday, accepted deposits up to clos
ing Saturday. It was unknown Friday
.whether the bank would open Saturday
| morning. Bank Inspector Walter, who is
in charge, says if it can be proven that the
bank was insolvent and that its officers
knew it, then the acceptance of deposits
was a violation of law. Comptroller Eckels
says that Bank Examiner Tucker criti
cized the management of the bank in his
October letter and the officers were
promptly notified.
Another failure to-day resulted from the
closing of the bank. J. H. and Leonard
Suafer & Co. assigned as commission
merchants. Liabilities and assets are not
known. The Newport banks were not
subjected to runs, to-day and had they
been would easily have met any demand
on them.

UNITED STATES
SENATORS CHOSEN
William E. Mason Wins a
Hard-Fought Battle
in Illinois.
Jones of Arkansas, Vest and
Teller Meet With No
Opposition.
Platt of N w Y^rk Also Has a Walk
overâPenrose Will Take Don
Cameron's Seat.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 19â William
E. Mason will be the next United States
Senator from Illinois. He was nominated
by acclamation at the joint Republican
caucus to-night, all other candidates hav
ing been wi:hdrawn after it became ap
parent that nothing could keep him from
receiving enough votes to make him the
caucus nominee. At noon to-morrow he
will receive the votes of the Republicans
at the joint session of the General Assem
bly, and on March 4 he will take Senator
John M. Palmer's seat.
It became evident early to-day lhat
there would be a choice to-night. Lori
mer could not hold the Cook County
forces, and it was openly reported that
Governer Tanner had transferred his al
legiance and was lending his support to
Hitt's candidacy.
There was no possible chance for Lori
mer being nominated, as there was not
another candidate wha could deliver
enough votes to him. The Cook County
members refuseJ to nominate a man out
side of Cook County when it was possible
to elect a man from the Windy City, even
if he was an avowed enemy of the ma
chine. The whole matter hinged on the
action of the Cook County members, and
it was to them tnat all candidates came
with proposals of combinations and com
promises.
A caucus was called for 4 o'clock, but at
that hour there was uncertainty among
the members as to the course to be pur
sue!. An adjournment was taken till 6
o'clock, when about twenty live members
went into the caucus. The others, about
thirteen in number, refused to participate
in the caucus, as they have never viewed
Lorimer's candidacy with approval. Sena
tor Crawford presided, aud among those
who were present were Dr. Jamieson,
member of the National Republican Com
mittee, and Sale Treasurer Hertz, who
were responsible for the withdrawal of
Madden lrom the race several days ago.
Lorimer made a short address and
thanked the members for their loyalty,
and said that he had decided to withdraw
in favor of Mason.
When the j >int caucus met it was con
ceded that Mason would be nominated on
the first ballot, but that was not neces
sary, as he received the nomination by ac
clamation, a great shout going np from
the house and galleries. Every Republi
can was present. The doors were thrown
open to the public.
Mason made an eloquent speech, and
was followed hy Messrs. Hilt, Carr, Hop
kins and Hon. Chanes E. Fuller.
William Ernst Mason was born in
Franfclinvilie, Cattaragus County, N. V..
July 7, 1850. His father was an active
abolitionist and politician, who supported

of Thomaa F. Withrow and came to Chi
cago with Mr. AVithrow when that lawyer
was appointed general solicitor of the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.
At the end of the year Mr. Mason entered
tbe office of John N. Jewett, one of Chi
cago's bent lawyers, where he continued
his studies and the practice of law for five
year 3. In 1877 he formed a partnersbip
with Juslic- of the Peace R. H. \Vallace
and soon won a reputation as v brilliant
lawyer and orator, and active politic. an.
He was always a stanch Republican.
He was elected a member of the Thirty
first General Assembly from the old Fifth
District, ana in 1882 lie whs sent to the
State Senate from the new Ninth District.
He gained the confidence of his pitrty
by his clean record in the Legislature and
was promoted to a seat in Congress from
the Third District of Chicago. At the ex
piration of his teim Mr. Mason settled
down to the practice of bis profession in
this city and has become connected with
many notable cases. He was married is
1873 to Miss Julia Edith White, daughter
of George White, a wholesale merchant of
Dcs Moinps, lows.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. If).â Henry M.

Humors of Senatorial Combinations That
i'niixr Sovie Annoyance.
N"EW YORK, N. V., Jan. 19.â A Times
special from Washington says: A few
Democratic Senators were surprised and
annoyed to-day by the publication of a
story alleging tlat three sound-money
Democrats have made a compact to vote
in the next session with the Republicans
to give the latter the organization of the,
Senate, and further to assist the Repub
licans to pass 8 tariff bill. In the fanciful
story referred to the names of the three
Senators were withheld.
It is necessary in order to judge of the
plausibility of the story to note that there
will oe of ascertained sound-money Demo
crats in the next Senate just six mem
bersâ Caffery, Gray, Lindsay, Mitchell ot
Wisconsin, Murpny and Smith. The
three men in the alleged compact would
be found among these six. It is not
either of the first three, and Mitchell,
Murphy and Smith say it is not either of
them.
No one would believe for a moment that
Cafft-ry, Gray or Lindsay would co into
such a compact for patronage or for any
other reason. They certainly would not
agree to support any tariff bill that the
Republicans chose to iass, because they
are all free tariff Democrats. Murphy and
Smith might be moderate protectionists,
but they could give only two vote*, and
they would not give them away in the
fashion suggested. It was impossible to
find a Democrat yesterday wiio had heard
o! the alleged compact in or out of the
Senate.

Senator Platl's Jfirat Lieutenant Call*
on the I'rrsidrnt-JSlrcf.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 19.â Edward
Lauterbach, Platt's lieutenant, called on
Major McKinley to-day and explained the
wishes and purposes of the New York Re
publican organization. Mr. Lauterbach
said the organization desired harmony,
and hoped the Federal appointments
would not be objectionable.
"We do not expect to ask for any one's
appointment," said Mr. Lauterbacli,
"Dut we trust no one will be appointed
who will interfere with the work of the or
ganization or be a source of annoyance to
it."
"What about the Cabinet?" was asked.
"New York will, in my opinion," said
Mr. Lauterbach, "have a representative in
Major McKinley's Cabinet. Of course I
don't know who will receive the honor.
We discussed several men, all of whom
would be acceptable Among them were
General Stewart L. Woodiord, Benjamin
t\ Tracey, J. fcloat Fassett and Congress
man Payne. Mr. Platt is not and will not
be a candidate for the Cabinet. He has
been suggested as a possible Secretary of
the Treasury, but I know he is satisfied
with his present position and wants to re
tain it."
Mr. Lauterbach's interview was a rather
lorrnal one.
W. J. Arkell Hamilton, the cartoon
artist, and Abner McKinley were among
the callers to-day.

John C. "Spooner of Wisconsin reached
Canton this evening. Mr. Spooner came
to c#nfer with the President-elest about
the selection of a Cabinet officer from
Wisconsin. Mr. Spooner thinks Henry
0. Payne ought to be appointed, and says
the active politicians of the State are bo
hind him. Major McKinley has not in
timated what his intentions are with refer
ence to the appointment of Mr. Payne,
but the belief prevails that the chances
are that Wisconsin will not be represented
in the Cab net.
Major and Mrs. McKinley, accompanied
by a number of friends, attended a con

LINCOLN, Nebr , Jan. 19.â 1n the State
Senate to-d iy Ransom of Douglas County
offered a resolution which is intended as
instructions to United States Senator John
M. Thurston. He reiterated at length the
letters and declarations of Senator Thurs
ton on the financial question prior to his
election. He quoted largely from Mr.
Thurston's letters to Jay Burrows of Ne
braska and the speech made by him when
he was elected to the United States Sen
ate, declaring in favor of free silver and in
opposition to the single gold standard ana
asking to be instructed by the Legislature.
The resolution then declares that it is
the sense of the present Legislature that
Senator Thur-ton be instructed to vote
and use his test endeavors to secure
free coinage of silver and that certified
copies of the resolution be transmuted to
Senator Thurston. No action was talcen.
Senator Ransom's ground for offering the
resolution is that Senator Thurston when
elected requested suggestions from the
Legislature.

A TOUCHING NOTE
Father and Child Reunited
Through the Medium
of a Letter.
Little Clara Gordon Comes Alone
From Sweden to Join Her
Parent.
Sent For After She Had Written of
Her Divorced Mother's Incarcera
tion in an Asylum-
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 19.â A beau
tiful and touching romance was brought
to light to-day in an action before Judge
Allen of the Superior Court for the ap
pointment of a father as his child's
guardian, he having been divorced from
the little one's mother.
In the spring of 1894 Mrs. Clara M.
Gordon and her husband, Thomas Gor
don, who were living in the city, had a
disagreement that resulted in a divorce.
The suit was brought by Mrs. Gordon,
and a decree was granted to her on March
17, 1894. The couple had one c ild, a
little girl, at that time 8 years of age,
and the custody of the child was awarded
to the mother.
Mrs. Gordon, who had gone with her
little daughter to Sweden, became insane
a year ago and was confined in an asylum
at Stockholm, being later removed to an
asylum at Nypring, where she is at the
present time.
After Mrs. Gordon lost her mind, the
daughter, little Clara Gordon, who had
grown to be a winsome and intelligent
child, wrote a letter to her father, and it
must have stirred his heart to the depths.
It was unconsciously pathetic In it the
little ftirl informed "her papa that her
mother had lost her mind, and that it
made her very sad, and asked her faiher
to send for her, because she felt so lonely;
Mrs. Gordon became temporarily bet- I
ter, and during the lucid interval she set j
in motion the wheels of government in ;
Sweden to have her daughter sent back to |
America and placed in charge of the j
father. After she grew wur-e the child j
was started on the long journey and ar- j
rived safely. Since that time she has j
been receiving Ler father's care. The j
child'i touching letter may brin^ about a !
reconciliation between her parents.
SUCCESS OF THE FAIR.

LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Jan. 19.â The
home products exhibit at Hazards Pavilion i
in this city is a unique aggregation of ;

weii known. The day will witness the at
tendance of thousands of people.
The railway companies, lealizint; the
importance of the lair, have a reed to
make special rates from Southern Califor
nia points.
The town is fairly well filled with tour
ists, who are delighted at tiÂ»e opportunity
to see what kind of Ihiugsare made in
this far-wes em country, with its wildness
and wooliness. There are quite a number
of small factory plants in machinery hall,
which are in rapid operation, turning out
implements and wares for the market.
For instance, tnere is a small shoe factory,
the managers of which announce that
they '*will take your measure and make
you an elegant pair of shoes while you
wait," and the waiting is limited to ten
minute?.
This was W. C. T. U. day, and the white

UKIAH, Cal., Jan. 19.â That tne resi
dents of this place are in sympathy with
A. W, Foster in his fight against Sidney

SAN DIEGO EJECTMENTS.
Squatters on Lands Claimed by the
Southern California Ordered
to Depart.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 19.â T0-da7
the Sheriff served writs of ejectment upon
thirty squatters on the water front. Some
of them agreed to leave as soon as they
could remove their cabins and find a
place to go to. Others stated that they
would not leave. They were then notified
that if they did not vacate to-morrow
they would be forcibly ejected on Thurs
day morning and their shanties torn
down.
There is considerable excitement over
the threatened disturbance. The land is
claimed by the Southern California Rail
way as part of its right ot way. A suit
for possession was decided in favor of the
company a few weeks ago, since which
time the company's surveyors have been
running lines so as io locate the extent
of the company's lands. Those within
these limits will be removed. Tbe squat
ters make no claim to the lands, but
deny that the railroad company has any
title, alleging that it has violated its
charter in removing the maciiine-shop3
from National City. They also claim
that some of the lands belong to the city
and some to the State, having been
bought from unknown owners at delin
quent sales.

Planned tor To-Day.

sports of the second day of the Field
Trials opened bright and early this morn

everything that big-hearted hospitality
can make it. Â,â :â  i

morning was Captain A. C. Jones' Donna
Alicia and Wyatt Allen's Eli. These dogs
did some good work. The first displayed
the most speed and the widest range. . â¢
.The second brace was C. A. Haight's
Glennwood and A. T. OoJghan's Speedy.
They were put on scattered birds. They
ran through them, flushed a number, but
mnde no points.
The third was R. C. Irvin's Chlmmie
Madden and J. H. Schumacher's Valiente.
In this one a covey was flushed by the
horsemen, the dogs flushing many, but
getting no points. Valiente is a fast,
stylish doc, with wide range. "
These were .followed by K. B. Funk's
Stamboul Queen an<i A. B. Trueman's
Lady Swizler. The Queen did not do so
well", but she showed the best style and
speea.
Then came the fifth brace, J. F. Hughes'
Bueno and H. D. Black's Topsy. Both
displayed some good work, but broke and
ran at every shot. They have no show,
however, of getting into the second series..
Two braces in the second series were set
down. Thry were maae. up of Wicklow
and Sadie Hopkins and ' Countess â  K. and
Donna Alicia. In- the first Sadie out
classed Wicklow in every respect.

of any so far during the trials. Both

tess X worked faster and coveted her
ground more thoroughly. This concluded
the day's sport,.

Contest Between Its
Parents.
San Franciscan and His Wife
Carry Their Quarrel
Into Court
Each Determined to Gain. Possession
of Their Twelve- Year-Old
Daughter.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 19.â Several
weeks ago Mrs. Charles Yoell, wife of a
San Francisco harness-maker, arrived in
Stockton with her 12-year-old daughter.
She had some differences with her hus-
Dand and was determined, at all hazards,
to retain the custody of the child. In
order to keep her where Yoell could not
get her, she placed the child in the con
vent here and ferbid any one seeing her.
Yoell telephoned from San Francisco
last Saturday invoking the aid of the
Sheriff and Chief of Police of this city to
find the girl. Deputy Sheriff Black
located her in the convent, and the father
was notified. He arrived this morning
with a letter from Secretary Holbrook of
the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society of San
Francisco, asking that the custody of the
girl be awarded to him. He sought the
aid of the officers and of Mr.". Loomis,
secretary of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, of this city.
When the father demanded his daughter
at the convent he was unsuccessful, but
late this afternoon Mrs. Loornis succeeded
in convincing the sisters that he was the
proper custodian of the child and she was
turned over to him.
When the mother learned this she en
gaged the services of an attorney, and he
went before Judg- Budd, procuring a writ
of habeas corpus directing that the girl be
produced in court to-morrow morning.
In the meantime she is at the home of
Mrs. Loomis, and to-morrow there will De
a battle royal in court between the father
and mother to determine which wil
finally have the custody of the child.
REUNITED AFTER MANY YEARS.
Aged Stockton Woman Surprised by the
Cowing of Her Long-Missing
Son.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 19.â Last Friday
morning a young man, shivering with
cold, knocked at the floor of a little cot
tage back of the big water tank at the
corner of Sacramento and Lafayette
streets. In response to the knock an aged
woman appeared at the door and looked
inquiringly at him. The young man was
the first to speak. "Are yuu Elizabeth
Aikley?" he asked.
"Yes." was the answer.
"Mother, don't you Know me? I am
Johnny."
"Thank God!" was all she said, and
they fell into each other's arm?.
Mrs. Aikley and her son, who is now 28
years of age, had not seen each other since
March 4, 1870. The story in connection
with the parting of mother and son was
told by Mrs. Aikiey this morning. She
had left San Francisco twenty-seven years
ago to establish a home in Stockton.
She finally settled here, but since then
had been unable to find any trace of her
three sons, whom she left in San Fran
cisco. For years she had been endeavor
ing to get some clew to their whereabouts,
but without avail. She wrote to Chief
Crowley, but his efforts in the old lady's
behalf were unsuccessful. Last week she
obtained information that led her to be
lieve one of her sons was in San Francisco
and she wrote to him. He arrived by boat
Friday and found his mother after seven
teen years of absence.

stating that he would deposit them if he
could draw them out when needed.
Lycodord, in order to make a practical
demonstration, took them to the bank and
drew $300. At his home Lycodord put his
money, with that of ttie other man into

morning when Lycodord opened the valise
he found only a piece of iron.

JURORS SWORN
IN SANDERS' CASE
Twelve Fresnoites Chosen
to Sit in Judgment
on the Forger.
Judge and Lawyers Marvel at
the Rapidity With Which
They Are Selected.
In Anticipation of Slower Progress,
the Witnesses Had Been Ex
cused Until Monday.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 19.â These juror?
will determine tbe guilt or innocence of
Professor W. A. Sanders, on trial for forg
ing William Wootton's name to a $1400
draft: D. A. Dunbar, J. M. Rose, George
Pickford, John A. Frasier, John Brazill,
f. R. Leonhart, J. A. Banks, I. H. Wash,
John C. Moore, William Lloyd, R. L. Bair
and G. R. Freeman.
To the surprise of every one the jury was
completed! by 10 o'clock this forenoon.
Judge Webb had been of the opinion that
it would take the entire week to find
twelve men who would be acceptable.
He did not expect that the introduction of
testimony would be commenced before
next Monday, and for this reason made
all the subpenas for witnesses returnable
on that day.
The rapidity with which the jury was
sworn was remarkable, and surprised
everybody connected with the case. As
the witnesses will not appear until Mon
day Judge Webb to-day continued the
trial to 9:30 o'clock on the morning of
that day.
The success in obtaining a jury in a case
which has been before the public so promi
nently for a long time was due to the
strange fact that most of the talesmen
who were first called to the box had never
read or talked of the case to any extent.
They appeared to have very little knowl
edge concerning it and were of the opinion
that they could act as jurors without
prejudice or bias.
Almost all had known of Professor San
ders before his connection with Wootton's
disappearance, bat few were personally
acquainted with him.
Of course the few peremptory challenges
allowed the attorneys tended to hasten
matters. The prosecution under the rules
had only five challenges at its command,
and it used three of them. The defense
was allowed ten, and it exhausted its
privilege. It is understood that both sides
are satisfied with the jury and are confi
dent that an honest verdict will be ren
dered. Neither the prosecution nor the
defense, it is said, believes the other has
any particular advantage in the make-up
of the jury.
Stanford Musical Concert*.

SENATOR SQUIRE
Makes a Small Showing
in the First Ballot
at Olympia.
Followers of the Incumbant Say
That H2 Has Strength
in Reserve.
Contest in Washington's Legislature
G v:s Promise of Being a
Protractei One.
OLYMPIA, Wash , Jan. 19.â The first
Senatorial vote was taken at noon to-day
in the two houses of the Legislature.
The result was: Turner 17. Daniels 14,
Squire 3. Cline9, Clark Davis 6, Baker 6,
Winsor 10, Caton 4. Denny 25, scattering
17. Turner and Squire are free-silver Re
publican?, Caton a Democrat, Dsnny a
gold Republican and tbe others Populists.
Turner's vote was as expected, but
Squire's ?mall showing was a surprise to
all. It is said he Is holding many votes in
: reserve to spring at the proper time and
f-ise a stampede. Turner is hopeful, it
;â ! iengrally believed that Daniels' vote is
really a Turner vote. Cline is regarded as
the strongest Populist.
The attempt to secure a caucus to
morrow night will not succeed. Fifty
seven votes are needed for a choice. The
pTesent outlook is for a protracted con
test. Cline's friends believe he is the man.
The Squire men are not jubilant to-niglit,
thQUt-h making many claims of reserved
strength.
Tile "third house," composed of Popu
lists, held a meeting to-night and ap
pointed a committee of three to see if a
Populist daily paper could be run here
during the Senatorial campaign to keep
Populists in line for one of ttieir number
for Senator. A committee to arrange for
a parade. of Populists each night was also
appointed. Indignation is expressed at
Popu!ist3 who voted for Turner to-day.
Every. possible power will be brought to
bear to hold them in line for a middle-of
iue-foas Populist for the Senate.
DEADLOCK iy UTAH.
Sitter reeling JXetwecn the Thatcher and
Ravelins for cm
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 19.â The first
ballot in the Utah Legislature for United
State* Senator, taken this afternoon, re
sulted as follows: Thatcher (D.) 19, Raw-
Jins (D.) IS, Henderson (D.) 16, Lawrence
(Pop.) 4, Brown (R.) 3, bcattering 2.
.Necessary to a choice 32.
It looks like a deadlock for the present,
as the supporters of the highest three can
didates are very determined and the feel
ing is bitter, especially between the
Thatcher and Rawims lorces. Hender
son, it is claimed, has eight supootters
â who will stay with him to t;e last ditch.
The next ballot, which will be taken to
morrow, i< not expected to show any
material change from that of to-day.
JiriiHf: Jg-UXXLB itA.L,LOTS.
Idaho Populists Desert Clagett and Cen
ter on WaVan.
BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 19.â Three ballots
were taken in the State Legislature to-day
for United States Senator. The Populists
left Ciagett and centered on Walton. Du
bois held the vote of the silver Republi
cans while the Democrats favored Lewis
and Nelson, Populists, alternately. The
liist two ballots gave Walton 28, Duboi3
25, Lewis IG. and the third ballot resulted:
Walton 23, Dubois 25. Neison 16.
Tcere was strong contention in the Pop
ulist caucus. The anti-Ciagett men of the
party offered to vote for Ciagett if his
name. should then be withdrawn, but this
was declined, and although it is claimed
the Democrats will never support CJagett
his name will likely pop up again, as he
controls the caucus, and is reported to
have said that the Senator would be either
himself or Dubois.
It is- also claimed that ths Democrats
will lake up Lewis or Nelsc-n seriously,
end on tne other hand there are Popnlista
who declare they will no Jonger be drag
gooned into supporting Clagctt.
In Nevada's J^'gislature.
CARSON, Nev., Jan. 19.â Nothing of
importance came up to-day in the Nevada

concurrent reso.ution was introduced and
referred, to a committee to the effect thai
no regular session of the Legislature ex
ceed tinny day 3 and that no special ses
sion exceed ten days. feenaie bill 1
passed ihe Senate, appropriating $3_',Coo
for the Legislature. T.'ie woman's suffrage
bill was made a special order for Janu

Ao Quorum at Snlem.
BALEM, Or., Jan. 19.â The House and
Senate met at 2 o'clock. The Senate ad
journed until to-morrow at 10 a. m. There
was no quorum in the House, and con
sequently no organization. There is a
/very general rumor among the members
1 ..<â  ''third House" that an organization
">y oe effected to-morrow, but there ap-
JAtafa to oe no substantial foundation lor
jhe rumor. It is said the conces^iun will
tome ircm the "regulars," but they shake
their heads when asked as to its truth.
Unless some compromise is effected before
Ion?, there will be no legislative session
this year.
TO HELL, XOUAXfXLLtS HOME.
Directors Detir- That the State Acquire
the I'roperty.
NAPA, Cal., Jan. 19 âPapers were tiled
in the Superior Court yesterday by H.
M. Barstow, asking for authority on be
half of the Veterans' Home Association,
to sell its property near Yountv'ille to the
State. This is an outgrowth of thÂ« pend
ing dispute between the State officials and
the home directors over the status of the
Lome and its Tight to Staie aid. The pro
ceeding is taken now in order that the
whoie matter may be considered by the
Legislature. It is hoped that the prop
erty may be taken by the State in consid
erationof its pgreeraent to maintain the
home and thus settle the question of the
rif-vit of the old veterans to State aid. If
it should not be taken, the petition avers,
in all probability State aid will be with
drawn, the home closed and its inmates
ca^t adrift to find shelter if they can, and,
if not, to become tramps and vagabonds.
Â»Xt Monday is the time fixed by the Su
perior Court for the hearing of the appli
cation.

HIS SPADE FINDS
A BREATHING BODY
By Chance a Laboring Man
Rescues an Entombed
Companion.
While Shoveling Sand Into a
Wagon He Uncovers the
Unfortunate.
Had Missed His F?l low-Workman but
Knew Not That Caving Earth
Had Buried Him.
SANTA CRUZ, Cau, .inn. M- â For
nearly an hour yesterday Charles Dean of
Ben Lomond was entombed alive. Withal
Charles D?an has abundant cauÂ«e for
thanksgiving, for had not a shovel wielded
by a le' low-work man pierced the earth
that covered him he would not now be re
counting his awful experience. It was
not that his reÂ«cner knew that be was en
tombed; the discovery was quite by acci
dent and came in the nature of a surprise.
How Dean succeeded in breathing when
covered by several feet of sand is a prob
lem which the people out at Ben Lomond
to-day have not yet been able to solve.
Dean and James Smith were hauling
sand, and, while Smith drove the team
with the loaded wagon to the place of de
posit, Dean would remain at the Rand
bank to prepare for another load. Smith
came back to the sandbank on one trip
and found t^at Dean had cut down the
usual quantity from the bank, but was not
there to help load the waeon. He pro
ceeded with his work, expecting the re
tnrn of his fellow-workman, but when the
wagon bad been nearly filled and Dean
did not return Smith was about to con
clude ttat he had quit his job. His
shovel suddenly struck something yield
ing, but immovable. The discovorv fricht
ened him, but the find was Â«oon developed
and Dean was dragged our from the tem
porary grave he had occupied for an hour,
with a broken leg.
TROUBLES OF A COKPORAJIOX.
Goes Info Tmtnlrency to Settle Strife
Rei%c*n It* Member*.
SANTA CRUZ, Gal.. Jan. 19â The
Grover- Cunningham Mill and Lumber
Company has, in order to settle the differ
ences between the two companies compos
ing the corporation, filed a voluntary
petition in .the Superior Court asking to
be declared insolvent. The liabilities of
the petitioner are written in the petition
as $29,767, and of this amount Cunning
ham & Co. claim a credit of $22,500 and
Grover & Co. a credit of $3110. The actual
debts of the corporation in fact are small.
The trouble between Cunningham tfc
Co. dates back almost to the time of their
consolidation into the present coroora
tion. They were of a character thaf had
no interest for thf public until one Sun
day last sprinc tno Cunninghams tried to
break open the safe of the corporation for
the purpose of removing the bioks which
the Grovers had locked within. Arre9ts
followed, but only civil sutti were brought.
The Cuuninghama had controlled the
election of the board of directors, and the
Grovers, having possession of the books,
locked them in the office safe and changed
the combination.
From that time there has been an effort
to dissolve the corporation, but without
success until the present nlnn of insolv
ency was concpived. This action does not
indicate a failure in the lnmber industry
in Santa Cruz, but the inability of two
lumber companies to do business as a
corporation.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 19â The
steamer Coos Bay ventured to make the
landing here last night at low tide and ran
aground just as it reached the wharf. The
force of its movement was increased
by a long swell that jammed
the vessel so hard against ihe
piling at the end that a dozen
piles were burst fr^ni tneir fastenings, and
one of the steamer's small boats was
crushed into kindling wood. The passen-

Good wages have been ma le at that point,
but the metal is dust gold and difficult to
save in paying quantities. The gold has
washed down from the hills and is he <1
in place by the shifting of the beach sands
moved by the surf.

DISTILLERIES IN A CAVERN.
Moonshine Plants Discovered by Govern
ment Officials White Exploring a
Kentucky Mountain.
DANVILLE, Kt., Jan. 19.â James C.
Wilson of Harrodsburg, Deputy Internal
Revenue Collector, who was in Danville
last night to report to his chief, tells of an
important discovery made by him and
Deputy United States Marshals Tom Aus
tin and John Mullins.
On Crooked Creek in Rockcastle County
on last Friday night they entered what
they had been told was a small cavern in
the side of a mountain to look for a moon
shine distillery said to be in operation
there. Having some trouble in finding
the alleged still the three pushed on and
suddenly fonnd themselves in an immense
underground passage. This they followed
through winding roads, sharp turns, nar
row passazes and huge chambers for fuliy
a mile and thrÂ»e-quarters, finding in that
distance two good-sized moonshine dis
tillery plants.
After destroying these the officers con
cluded to return and prepaie for a more
thorough investigation. Wilson feels posi
tive a long chain of underground distil
leries is to be found there, as a great deal
of moonshine whisky has been traced to
this neighborhood for years without the
Government agents being able to locate
the point ol manufacture.
The cave discovered is a wonder and
will itself bear exploration. There are in
dications of its having been known to the
moonshiners for a lone time, as they have
put long ladders in places difficult to as
cend or descend, and have widened nar
row passage< by hewing out the solid
rock.* The place is admirably adapted for
the purpose of moonshining and tue pro
tection of outlaws, for there aro many
places where one man, armed with a Win
chester rifle, could hold a large posse a
bay.
SLEEPS FOR ELEVEN DAYS.
Strange S, umber of a Young Lady of
Danbury, Conn., Who Awakes With
an Appetite.
DANBURY, Coxx., Jan. 19.â Miss Char
lotte Pittilla awoke from her eleven days'
slumber yesterday. She showed slight
indications of returning consciousness
Saturday night, and her doctor expected
the change that came yesterday morning.
When some of the members of the family
xvent into the girl's room after breakfast
they found her lying with her eyes open
and apparently conscious. Whert they
spoke to her she an o wered by asking for
something to eat. Her voice was so weak
that her words were scarcely audible.
After they had taken fo d to her the doc
tor arrived, and perceiving her extremely
weak condition, gave orders that she must
not be si oken to except when necessary.
Miss PittiUa told the doctor that she
thought she had just awakened from a
night's sleep. He told her she had been
very ill. ''Why, I have not been ill, have
I?" asked she. "I have only bcra sleep
ing."
The doctor asked her if she remembered
seeing him before, but she said she did
not remember anything. He did not
question her further, as she seemed to be
d zed. The girl slept the greater part of
yesterday.
The peculiar illness of the young woman
and her lone state of nncousciousness the
doctor attributes to a severe shock to her
nervous system. She became ill eleven
days ago, and since then has lain uncon
scious until her awakening yesterday
morning.
GENERAL SHERMAN'S LIBRARY.
Sold by a St. Louis Carpenter for $30.
Many Valuable Works in the
Collection.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 19.â A special to a
morning paper from St. Louis says: A
collection of books of the late General
W. T. Sherman was sold.in St. Louis dur
ing the last week for $30. It consisted of
about fifty volumes of army records, regi
mental history, court-martial records and
a general manuscript of war literature.
The sale was made by Thomas Dooley, a
carpenter, who did wont for General Sher
man while the latter had his headquarters
in this city as the commander of the
United States army.
According to Dooiey, General Sherman
cave him the books ju^t before he left St.
Louis. The carpenter kept tnem un il he
moved a short time ago, when he packed
the library in four large boxes. He then
sold the outfit to a downtown book-dealer
here for $30. On examination the book
doaier found a number of valuable pifces
of literature, and a large proportion of the
books contained the autographs of men of
renown.
There were testimonials from U. 8.
Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, Phil Sheri
dan and others, besides any number of
books presented to General Sherman by
the authors. Many books, otherwise
worthless, were made valuable by the
autograph of the general himself. A larae
number of people have examined the col
lection, and negotiations with several
G. A. R. posts and some military organ
izations looking to the sale of the collec
tion or part oi'it, are going on.

i
Lashes the Ocean Into a Foam-Coy*
ered Caldron tor Hundreds of

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 19.â
The brig Courtney Ford from Tahiti
brings an account of a remarkable water
spout witnessed in the trop d on the voy
age to this port. In longitude 143 and lat
itude 151 4, on November 28, at 6 p. M.,
a tremendous walerspout was observed
scarcely a mile from the vessel. During
the first five minutes it remained station
ary and reached an altitude of over 1000
feet, ending in a curious curaulous cloud.
Its base was several hundred feet in di
ameter, and around it the sea was lashed
into a caldron of white foam for a space
of several hundred yard* in circumfer
ence.
The wind from the southeast was blow
ing at the rate of about two miles an hour.
Slowly the srout moved away, though
it remained in plain view for over an
hour. Immediately afterward heavy
clouds darkened the horizon and an ex
ceedingly heavy downpour of rain fol
lowed. Two hour lat^r the sky was
cleared as if by magic and the wind veered
to the southwest, carrying the vessel far
away from the locality. Captain McLeod
tiled a report on the phenomenon, with the
hydrographic office.
THREE MORE BANKS FAIL
Fran'.ic Depositors Clamor for Admission
To the Closed First National of
Newport, Ky.
CINCINNATI, Ohio. Jan. 19.â When
the First National Bank of Newport did
not open its doors yesterday there was
much excitement. A crowd of excited de
positors assembled in front of the bank,
clamoring for an explanation. No one
was allowed in the institution.
The officials sent out word that the bant
was solvent, but had been forced to
close for lack of ready money. Depos
itors, however, refused to be satisfied.
Ui.lv rumors found expression. The ex
citement grew still greater when it be
came known that Comptroller Eckles and
a national banK examiner of Washington
were to be in Newport to-day. Their trip
was designed especially for the purpose of
examining into the bank's affnirs. The
capital stock is $200,000. John Trapp is
president.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 19.â The Minne
sota Savings Bank succumbed Monday to
the recen. flurry in banking circles. Its
doors weie closed and a writ of assign
ment was filed in court. Joseph F. Beckel
of the Alamanda Bank is named as as
signee.
An affidavit was also filed stating that
the assets would reach about $250,000 and
the liabilities about $200,000. When the
excitement about the Twin Cities came the
Minnesota Bank took advantage of the
sixty-day notice, but the assignment was
made as the best stÂ°p for the depos.tors.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. Jan. 18.â The Ger
man National Bank did not open its doors
yesterday morning. The institution is in
the bindsof BankExaminerEscom. The
capital sio k is $251,500; surplus $31,000.
J. L. McNight ii president.
The bank has been in a shaky condition
for three years owing to the failure o the
Louisville Deposit Bank, losing $25,000
worth of lawsuits.
PERU MUST PAY THE CLAIM.
After Eleven Years the United States
Concludes to set a Consular
Agent R ght
NEW YORK. N. V.. Jan. 19.â A Herald
special from Washington says: The ad-
ministration is determined that Peru shali
pay the claim for $200,000 growing out of
the outrage committed in 1885 upon W.
H. McCord, a consular agent of the
United States. A cablegram has just
been sent to the United States Minister
in Lirr.a, directing him to inform the
Peruvian Government that the case must
be settled without delay. A communica
tiou received from the Minister a few
days ago announced that Peru desired
time in whicli to investigate the facts in
the case. Secretary Olney at once ad
vised Mr. McKenzie, the United States
Minister to Peru, that Peru had had more
than eleven years to conduct an investi
gation, and that this time was quite
enough.
The cruiser Philadelphia is now on her
way to Callao from Valparaiso. The
authorities sny her preset.ee in Peruvian
waters has nothing to do with the negotia
tions concerning the McCord case, but
her arrival at Callao immediately after
the presentation of a strong note by
McKenzie is expected to have a good
moral effect.
During the revolution in Peru in 1885
McCord, who was a railroad agent, was
ordered to place a train of cars at the dis
posal of a Peruvian officer for the purpose
of transporting supplies alone the line.
The order was complied with, but the
engineer gave up the engine to the iebeU.
McCord was arrested and sentenced to
be shot. This sentence was commuted
and he was notified that he must pay a
fine" of 10,000 soles. The friends of McCord
raised the necessary amount and h? was
relieved.

MARKET AND TAYLOR STS.
last evening, Mr. Bnggs, who wa3 one of
a committee appointed at s recent meet
ing of the club to confer with the officers
of the Olympic Gun Club ior the purpose
of procuring their views relative to the
holding of a bench show in this City this
year, said the directors of the Olympic
Gun Club were strongly in favor of a
show being held, nnd that if the Paci6c
Kennel Club decided to join the gun clab
ior that purpose each member must be
balloted for, as the gun club, according to
its laws, could not accept of the Pacific
Kennel Club in n body.
Mr. Haight suggested that the funds of
the club be given to some charitable in
stitution as the members did not take
sufficient interest in its welfare to attend
any of the meetings.
Mr. Bier, the president of the club,
thought that if a bench show committee
was formed the members who had evi
dently gone to the dogs would manifest
an interest in tne. club and rally to its
support; but when he asked for the
names of the members present who were
willing to servt' on such a committee not
a sound was heard until the cracking of
a match relieved the monotony.
Watson finally moved that the club
retire from the show business this year as
its watch dog I ad died because cf the lacic
of nourishment and support, and that the
American Kennel dub be so notified im
mediately.
The motion was seconded and carried by
a unanimous vote, and then there was
ceneral regret that the eld Pacific Kennel
Club had seen its best days.
Messrs. Bushnell and Haigbt were ap
pointed a committee to notify the Olympic
Gun Club at a meeting which wiil be held
this evening at 1303 Van Nes3 avenue, that
it would have the unanimous support of
the Pac fie Kennel Ciub should it conclude
to give a bench show in this City this
year.
Briggs, Brown. Bushnell, Ha'ght and
Watson were appointed a committee with
instructions to interview, personally, each
member of the Pacific Kennel Club and
procure his wish as to the disposal of the
money ($304), wiiica is now in ihe club's
treasury, and if the club shall continue to
remain on earth or disband, the committee
to report progress at the next monthly
meeting.
The president of the club, Mr. Bier, is in
favor "of holdinp the monÂ»y on hand in
case the Pacific Kennel Club should de
cide lat*Â»r on to give a show in 1898 â
that is, provided, of course, it will not
meet with any serious accident that may
curtail i's existence.
The Olympic Gun Club will doubtless
determine this evening what its pleasure
will be regarding the riving of a show on
Us orcn respons-ibi i y this year.
STAGES ON THE DESERT.
Freight Tariffs and Passenger Fares
Fixed to Ritnclsburj;
Instead of building an extension from
Mojave to Randsburg, ihe nietrorolis of a
booming mining section, the Southern
Pacific has acquired a rapid-transit staÂ«e
line, or made a traffic arrangement with
one of the stage iine3 that have been
scalping the public down in that region
since the new 3 first went forth to the
world that gold is to be found thereabouts.
The company's officials recently decided
to wait till greater age and ereater perma
nency to the volume of traffic descends on
Raixlsburg before recommending the ex
tension of the railroad.
The distance from Mojave to Randsburg
is forty-two mile? and the stag's lines for
the transportation of passengers and
freight have had the fixing of rates in
their own bands. The tublic had to pay
irregular heavy fares or walk. It is said
ibiitthe net profits of several stage lines
have been greater than any gold mine in
the Kands.burs district and would have
continued to hi had not ihe octopus got
in and made a deal with one of the lines.
The alliance of the Southern Pacific
with a stage line insures a uniform rate
for the transportation of passengers and
freight, and the other stage lines inu3t
meet, the rate or there will be a rate war
on the* trail that will make the desert
sands fly. There are several roads or trai's
by which the stages travel. One is the
old Borax road, another the old Death
Valley wagon road, and the latest is the
new stage road. Since the Southern Ph
c fie has absorbed or made a traffic agree
ment with a stage iine there promises to
be more work and faster traveling tor the
horses as a result of the competition.

JUDICIAL REFORM.
There are several resolutions at present before the Legislature embracing amend
ments to the sections of the constitution which relate to the judicial system of the
State of California. It seems more than probable that some such measure wiil re
ceive the necessary vote -to cause its submission to the people at the next geuernl
election. It is important, therefore, that the best possible amendment may be framed
by the Legislature, so that it may not fail of popular approval, and al&o in order
that, being adopted and put into practical effect, it may be found an improve
ment upon the existing judicial system of the State.
It cannot be denied that for the past several years there has been a growing
opinion that something is radically wrong with our present system of adminis
tering justice in California.
The finger of blame has been often laid upon this or that apparent defect. The in
volved ami cumbersome construction of the Supreme Courtand the consequent delays
in the final decision of appealed cases have frequently aroused the impatient protest
of litigants to whom such delay meant nothing less than a denial of justice. The in
creasing volume of appeals, which has doubtless made these delays compulsory, is
also a cause of complaint. Another ground of di>satisfaction has been the cost of
trials, new trials and appeals arising out of the increased use of court reporters ana
typewriters and the consequent expanding of transcripts and briefs beyond all of the
usages of former days.
If the Legislature shall find that these objections to our present judicial system
constitute sufficient reason for a, present attempt at reform it should nevertheless
no about such a proposed change cautiously, and with a firm anchorage to three
definite ideas. First, the Legislature should give the existing system due credit lor
its virtues- with a view to their carclul preservation in any adopted measure for its
reform. Second, the Legislature should weigh with care the importance of alleged
defects in the present system. Third, in any proposed remedy the LegisJature should
not venture far beyond the report of ciearly defined defects.
It should be borne in mind that the present Supreme Court inherited a legacy of
delayed cafes from its predecessor under the old constitution.
It must also be remembered that the first decade after the adoption of the new
constitution was rife with disputes as to its construction and over the constitution
ality of some of its most vital parts. It should be further recalled that for the past
several years s-uch important subjects as the election laws, the statutes regulating ir
rigation and water riphts, the sections of the codes bearing upon estates, adoption,
wills and domestic relations have been made the subject of frequent amendment and
of much Jitigation. These things have contributed to clog the wheels of our judicial
system temporarily, but whether permanently or not should be wisely weighed by
the Legislature before permanent and extensive changes in the system itself are pro
posed.
There is another point which it will be well for the Legislature to consider in
amending that portion of the constitution which pertains to the judiciary. It should
beware of legislating too much with a comparatively inflexible organic law. The best
constitution ib that which i 3 most general in ita provisions and simple in its terms.
The Federal constitution is a model for our Legislature in this respect. It provides
the National judicial system, but leaves to Congress the working out of the details
and their change to suit the changing conditions of the time. It will be well, there
lore, in any change of our present machinery for the administration of justice to leave
out of the constitution everything but a sufficient outline of the system to limit the
subsequent action of law-makers to definite lines, and thus give the merit of flexi
bility to it which our present system does not possess.
Tnese general principles are advanced for the guidance of the members of the
Legislature in this important subject of judicial reform. As yet no single suggested
amendment has sufficiently emerged from the flood of bills to require specific discus
sion. When any such system reaches the point of consideration in committee or
upon the floor of either House it will be time to place its particular merits and de
fects beueath the cathode ray of criticism.
THE DUTY OP ECONOMY-
The first duty imposed upon Republi- j
cans, who being in the majority of the i
State Legisla:ure are responsible for the
conduct of legislative business, is that of
strict, business-like economy. The people '
of the State have long clamored against |
the useless expenditure of money, and the
Republican party now being in power has
an opportunity to show its fitness to con- |
trol 'he affairs of the State by responding j
to these universal and well-founded de- j
mands on the part of their constituents.
The session began badly. The scandal
of the stuffed payroll dul not augur well
for the future. Tnat, however, is a matter
for whica the Republican party cannoi be
held responsible, inasmuch as the wrong
is divided between the chief clerk of the
As-embly and members of all parties in
that body. The steps vhich were taken
to probe the scandal are, moreover, dis
tinctly encouraging, and give reason for
believing that the Legislature will profit
by the lesson and be more prudent and
careful in dealing with all questions of
appropriating public money iiereafter.
The Legislature should dispense with
those needless junketing trips, which coat
so much money and effect so little of any
value. It should weigb and consider well
li II bills for appropriations of whatever
kind, and wlii.e bearing in mind that
parsimony is not economy should make
no appropriations that are not really
needed to maintain the usefulness and
efficiency of the various State institutions.
People are not opoosed to progress, but
they are opposed to those forms of 01
--pentliiure which so far from being pro
gressive really tend to retard the develop
ment of prosperity.
In addition to practicing economies
confined in their nature to ihe appropria
tions of this session it is the duty of the j
Legislature to provide for permanent j
economies which will save money, not j
only for the next two fiscal years, but vir- j
tuaily for all time to come. Some of these i
economies can be obininf d by abolishing j
useless comrnis ions which now consume '
30 much public money without mating '
any adeauate return. The people can I
well afford to dispense with several of the
existing commissions, and their abolition
would injure no industry or interest ot
any portion 01 the Slate.
We repeat, au opportunity is now before
the Republicans of the Legislature to ao
important work for the State in the di
rection ot the lon^-de^ired "economy, re
trenchment and reform." This oppor
tunity should be taken advantage ol by
the party leaders in the Legislature.
Party interest calls for it, the public wel
fare demands iÂ«, and it is the duty of ttie
Legislature to attend to it.
STANFOED UixIVERriTY.
The plea of President Jordan for the re
lief of Stanford University from taxation,
which was published In The Call yester
day, was in a brief space v thoroughly |
convincing argument in favor of the pro- j
po^ed measure. It was not lont;, but I
every word of it had weight, and it is I
hardly likely that any one will attempt to
refute eitaer its statements or its conclu
sions. President Jordan says:
There is no other State in the Union that re
ceives outside giits in so cold a spirit us CaJi
forn in, and lor that reason there is no large
State which has received so lew gifts. This
is uot because the Suite is really uufrienaiy,
but because the constitution and statutes were
ii Miutd beiore tMM mailers came 10 bo con
sidered. For instance, when Mr. KocKefeller
founded tho University ol Chicago it was ex
empted from luxation and the citizens of Chi
cago furnished all the buildings, duplicating
duliar for dollar the millions which Kockeiel
ler gave. Mr. Stanford iv making a larger
gilt than Mr. Kocke feiler exacted nothing in
return and has received nothing. 1l would
be litting as a (jraceiul act of recognition for
the State, which has already sent upward of
3000 students to Stanford University for their
education, to relieve the endowment from
taxation. Already through the generous v/ay
in which Mr. .Rockefeller's gift has been
treated the University of Chicago is Ã¼ble to
expend twice as much each year as Stanford,
though the original gift \us less.
The contrast between the way in which
California treats this munificent endow- j
ment and the way in which it would have I
been treated in any large Eastern city or |
in any city in Europe is certainly not to i
the credit of the State. While in other !
communities such endowments have been
added to and encouraged in every way,
California has deliberately lessened the j
endowment by imposing upon it onerous J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1897.
and needless taxes. According to the
statement of President Jordan, out of the
present income of $150,000 ot Stanford Uni
versity, more than fiO.OOO each year is
taken for State and county taxes, "and the
balance of Uie $200,000 representing its
annual cost of maintenance is taken from
Mrs. Stanford's private means â pin
money wnich she hau saved up for the
building of kindergartens and for addi
tions to the museum."
This showing is certainly not creditable
either to the wisdom or the gratitude of
the State. It is not grateful to Senator
Stanford and to Mrs. Stanford to thus tax
the benefits which they Have desired to
confer upon the people. Neither is it the
part of wisdom to take money from a uni
versity, where it serves the highest use,
and apply it to a lower one. The relief
asked for should be grunted at once.
THE COMMISdON BILL.
According to reports from Washington
there is iittle danger of the passage at this
session of Congress of the Harrison bill
providing for a commission o! Cabinet offi
cers to arrange a settlement of the Pacific
roads debts. It seems probable, therefore,
that the people will have abundant time
to consider well the meaning of the bill
and determine what course of action to
tako regarding it.
It is sa.d the bill will be reported by the
House committee and stands a fair chance
of passing that body, though it will be
strenuously opposed. An amendment will
be (ff.'red oy the opponents of the meas
ure requiring that the commission to be
appointed shall not report or adopt any
plan which contemplates refunding. If
this amendment should carry the bill
would be largely deprived of any dangers
that may lurk in it and, as there is a
strong sentiment in favor of the amend
ment, there is much of hope in the virtual
defeat of the bill, even in the House.
It is In the Senate, however, the battle
is expected to be won. It is claimed tuat
the bill will not be introduced into ihe
Senate until after it has been accepted by
the Hou^e. This will, of course, bring up
the measure very late in the session, and
it will be a comparatively easy task for
earnest and resolute men to either post
pone its consideration by dilatory tactics
or else "talk it to death." Both Senators
from California are reported to be con
fident of their ability to prevent the
passage of the bill in that body, and, as
they will have strong support, their con
fidence seems to be well justified.
"Under these circumstances, the fight
against the roads is virtually won 90 far
as this Congress is concerned. We are
now assured of a sufficient time to con
sider the changed ai-pect of the situation
and organize for such further contest as
may be necessary to guard all theinterests
of the State.
The outlook is certainly a promising
one, but the promises contained in it
should encourage us to new efforts and
new zeal, and not incline us to lay aside
vigilance and resolution. The resources
of the monopoly are many. It has not
yet abandoned the contst, and will not do
so as long as there is ihe slightest chance
of winning. A new session of Congress
will assemble early in the spring, and we
must be prepared to fight before that body
as we have fought in the past. What we
have gained so far is simply a breathing
spell, and the main issue is still before
us to be settled.
A farm of 200 acres picturesquely located
at the head of Chester Valley, wiihin an
hour's ride of Philadelphia, was recently
sold for $8300, which is estimated to be
less than tiie cost of the buildings on it.
As an illustration of the heavy shrinkage
of farm values in the East, the sale has
been the occasion of no little discussion,
and while some take a gloomy view of the
situation the Philadelphia Inquirer points
out that one conspicuous American, whose
fortune is counted in millions, made a
good deal of it by buying farms at such
times as those.
When Editor McCulJaj;h was alive all
the sparkle, snap and vim of the para
graphs of the St. Louis Globe- Democrat
were attributed to bini, but now he has
gone to the land of no paragraphing and
still those of the Globe- Democrat are as
good as ever. From this we may draw
the conclusion that a bright American
newspaper would continue to edit itself
with force and fluency even if all the
writers iv the world bad gone glimmering.

W. M. Is uiier, Assessor of Cniaveras County,
and G. O. King, Assessor of San Luis Oblspo,
who are also at the Grand, say with Mr. Spitzer
that the bill is a useful one. They and many

Mr. Spitzer is here for a brief stay only. He
will return to his home in a day or two. He
continues to maintain a strong- interest in
strain and fruit growing, notwithstanding his
retirement from the life of a farmer.
"It seems to me." he said, "that the valley
land of Santa Clara County is unsurDassed in
richness by any other land in all California.
Its soil is enduring, and the farmer who pos
sesses it has something that will always afford
him a steady revenue. I only wish there was
more of the valley land. It is of a kind that
Is satisfying to those who hold it."

Arrival of Bonanza Miner
J. J. Brown After See
ing Randsburg.
He Says the Surface Indications
of That D strict Are the Best
He Has Ever Known.
Mr. Brown and Mr- Shinn Will Proba
bly Visit the Mother LodeâOperat
ing Great Prrpsrties.
J. J. Brown, one of the largest owners
oi the famous Little Joiinny gold mine,
the richest at Leadville, and James A.
Shinn, lessee of the Cleveland and White
Cap mines in the same camp, arrived here
yesterday from Rand3burg and are at the
Lick.
They are among the biggest mining men
in Colorado. Mr. Brown was superinten
dent of Dave Moffatt's crackerjack mines
for eleven years. Arnorg them were the
celebrated Maid of Erin and the Hen
rietta. The Little Johnny, in which he
has a big interest, is the greatest mine
that has been developed in Leadviile in
recent years.
Mr. Brown owns many other interests be
sides this. Besides mining in different
parts of Colorado he is pushing work on
properties in Utah and Arizona, and was
till lately also developing property in
Montana. He went to Colorado in 188J
from the Black Hills. Mr. Shinn owns a
great deal of prospective property, be
sides carrying on the profitable leases of
the Cleveland and Whitecap, of tne latter
of which he is the active superintendent.
The gentlemen have put in three weeks
at Randsburg and think well of the new
camp.
"A good many men from Colorado, old
friends of ours, are there," aaid Mr. Brown,
"and we bought in with ?ome of them.
We didn't put in much money, but we
want to put in enough one way and an
other to test the claims and see what they
will do. If the veins go down all right it
will be a bie camp.
"I have visited a great many mining
camps hitherto, but I never saw any be
fore with such good surface indications.
When the quantity of gold found is con
sidered it is very reassuring. It looks to
me as though it would be a very good
district.
"One trouble about its development,
however, is that there is very little money
there. There is nothing as yet to do any
thing with. But the veins outcrop right
on the desert. Porphyry dykes outcrop in
places from five to twenty feet above the
surface, and parallel with the-e are veins
of quartz.
''The population is I think slightly on
the increase. It consists now of about
2000 people, but it is not concentrated. It
is scattered to three towns, RandsDurg,
Johannesburg and Oarlock, or Cow Wells,
where there are four to five two and five
stair. p mills, with a 10-sta.mp mill' almost
completed.
"I think very well of the district in
deed and if we got anything dowu there
one of us will come out and take charge
of it. I have been in California before,
but Mr. Shinn has not. Neither of us,
however, has ever been on the mother
lode. We have met several old friends
who are interested in mining there and
they have been telling us we ought to ex
amine the lode.
"It is our intention, if we can find the
time, to do so."
Mr. Brown saya it is pretty quiet all
over Colorado now. He attaches, how
ever, little importance to the pulling up
of the pnmpsfrom the mines at Leadville,
as recounted in recent dispatches. He
says this will really make small difference
in the mining development there.
TO AID ST. MARY'S.
The Catholic Ladies Will Get Book
Subscriptions to Raise the Debt
of the Cathedral.
At a meeting of the Catholic ladies of
this City, whoso object was to take
measures to aid St. Mary's Cathedral, the
plan adonted was to take book subscrip
tions, to be made during the coming year,
to be handed over to the cathedral next
Christmas. By his means it is hoped to
decrease the debt of the church, which
amounts to $65,000.
Many of the ladies present undertook to
be responsible .it the close of the year for
various large subscriptions. It is hoped
many others will suon give their co-opera
tion and that at the end of the year the
mother church of this City will be mate
rially relieved.
The Archbishop presided at the meeting.

HYDEANTS AEE NEEDED.
Factories on Sixth Avenue South Seek-
ing Protection Against Fire.
Sixth avenue south may have the ad
vantage of protection against fire soon.
Not long ago the glue works were de
stroyed rausine loss of life and a money
loss of $50,000. The street is eight feet be
low grade, and this has been one reasonwhy
a water main has not been laid through it.
There are tanneries and other establish
mer.t3in which large sum* of money are
invested and in which large manufactur

all practically without protection against
fire. The owners of property are stirring
themselves to have this condition of af
fairs done away with. A
Yesterday a representative of the pr"P--'l

Department Committee of the Board ot

miiiln be placed on the avenue. The coin
m ttee saw the need of hydrants and fully
understood tue danger in which valuable
property is placed by reason of their ab

water main the* hydrants would be use
less. After talking the maiter over an

C OLONEL GREENE TO LEAVE.
The Adjutant-Gfneral of the depart
ment of California to Go on the
Retired Lilt.
Colonel Oliver D. Greene, A. A. G.,
adjutant-general of the department of Cali
fornia, a position he has filed for some
time with credit to himself and the de
partment, will be retired next Monday on
account of age, having attained the num
ber of years when the law says officers of
the army must co on the retired list.
Colonel Greene has a brilliant military
record. He was born in New York in
1833. January 25, 1549, he was appointed
to the United States Military Academy at
West Point from his native State and en
tered there Juiy 1, 1849. He graduated in
July, 1854; became active brevet lieuten
ant of the Third Artillery July 1, 1854;
second lieutenant, Second Artillery, No
vember 2j, 1854; was appointed cantaiu
August 3, 1861; major. A. A. G., July 17,
1862; lieutenant-colonel, A. A. G., volun
teers, August 20, 1802; captain Second Ar
tillery, October 1, lfCjj; lieutenant-colonel,
A. A. G. (United States army), Feb
ruary 27, 18S7. His brevet rank
is as follows: Brevet captain United
States army, July 21. 1861, for gal
lant and meritorious service at â¢ the
battle of Bull Run, Va. ; brevet lieutenant
colonel March 13, 1865, ior meritorious and
gallant conduct at the battle of Cramp
tons Gap, Md. ; brevet colonel, U. S. A.,
March 13, 1865, for gallant and meritorious
service at rhe battle of Antietam, Md. ;
brevet brigadier-general, IT. S. A., March
13, 1865, for gallant and meritorious ser
vice during the War of the Rebellion.
At army headquarters it has not yet
been ascertained who will succeed Colonel
Greene in the position he now so ably
rills. It was expected that the late Major
Wilson, whose death occurred at Van
couver Barracks a few days since, would
have been his successor. Now there is
some talk that the position may go to
Colonel Sheridan, brother of "Gallant
Phil Sheridau."
It is not known whether the remains of
the late Albert S. "Willis, United States
Minister to the Hawaiian Islands, will,
upon reaching this City, be accorded mili
tary honors, no order to that effect having
been received from the War Department
at Washington.

"Mrs. Elizabeth McLeod, living at 21
Cortiand avenue, died uuclar peculiar
circumstances shortly after a violent
quarrel With her husband, William Mc
l^eod, a ship calker, yesterday after
noon. Several circumstances surround
ing the woman's death led the police to
believe that the husband had choked hi 3
wife to death and he was arrested and is
now in the City Prison charged with
murder.

ing her, and one time, in October, 1595,
he neariy choked her to death.
Tuesday, January 12, she swore to a
complaint in Judge Low's court charging
him with threats against hie. On Thurs
day he was arrested and Friday morning
the case was called in court. It was con
tinued till yesterday, and by consent of
the attorneys the Judge released McLeod
on h is own recognizance on his promise
that he would keep away from the house
till the case was disposed of.
McLeod kept his promise, and when the
case Wll3 again called yesterday Attorney
Walter Gallagher, who represented Mrs.
McLeod, had it again continued till to
morrow. Mrs. McLeod and her daughter,
Uattie McNie, by tier lir?t husband, were
in court, and Mrs. Eila Bates, a friend,
who lives at 2135 Center street, Berkeley,
ace mnanied her.
Mis. McLeod went homo with her
daughter and Mrs. Bates, and an hour
later McLeod made his appearance. He
had been drinking, and, as usual when in
his cups, he was in an ugly mood.
Mrs. McL?od motioned to Mrs.
Bate? not to leave tt:e room, and Mr?.
Bates took a piece of paper and wrote on
it, "Go down to the Police Court and
swear out another warrcnt against him."
Mrs. McLeod slipped out and went to
the City Hal!, but all the courts were
closed. She returned home about so'clock,
thinking McLeod had gone away.
He advanced toward her in a threaten
ing attitude, and she said, "Don't strike
me; I will go away." He grabbed her with
both hands by the throat and they both
fell to the floor, knocking over a rocking
chair. Mrs. Bates grabbed him by the
coat and tried to pull him away from her,
and after two or three minutes she suc
ceeded.

clutches she ran out of the liou^e to her

son, Charlie Bates of the Alcazar, went to
McLood's house and told him and his
mother that Mrs. McLeod was dead. Mc-
Leod replied, "l^et her die and be !"
Policeman Redmond, who lives a few
doors from McLeod's house, returned
home about this time, and he was notified
of the woman's death, but meantime a
message had been sent to the Seventeenth
atreet police sta'ion, and Policeman Slat
t*ry and Dr. Btmnieisu-r went out in the
patrol-wngon. Dr. Baumeister at once
pronounced life extinct, and the Morgue
omci<lÂ« were notified.
Mcl^eod was placed under arrest and
taken to the Seventeentn-street station by
Policeman Redmond, where he was booked
on the charge of murder. He refused to
make a statement to Captain Gilien, but
laier he was more inclined to talk.
He had nothing pood to say of his dead
wile and denied that he had ever been
married to her. They had lived together
lor about fivf years as man and wife, but
there never had bee.n any marriage cere
mony.
"When I went home," saia McLeod,
'they wore having some soup, and I said,
'Are you not troing to give me any?' My
wife got up and cut on her things in a
high-and-mighty way and said she was

got her to say so. I didn't choke her this
afternoonâ that I swear. She has been
troubled with heart dis 'ase for some years
and had a doctor attending her last sum
mer, so I suppose that is what caused her
death."
Mrs. McLeod vras a trained nurse, and
through her own savings she wax able to.
support her daughter, Hattie McN.e, now
about 23 years of age, who is a cripple.
She was highly snoken of by her neigh
bors, who sympathized with her, as they
all knew of the constant abuse she was
subjected to by her husband wuen he was
in liquor, which was very frequent.
On January 9, three days before she
swore to the last complaint for his arrest,
she swore to a complaint prepared by At
torney Gallagher for an absolute divorce
from her husband, in which many allega
tions of brutal treatment were made. The
complaint was not filed, as it was decided
to wait til! the case in Judge Low's court
was decided.
The house, 216 Cortiand avenue, where
they lived was community property.
McLeod is a native of Nova Scotia and
has been in this City for the past ten years.
An autopsy was held on the body of
Mrs. McLeod at the Morgue last evening,
and it was found that death resulted from
peiicarditi9, a disease of the heart's cov
ering, nnd fatty degeneration of the heart.
No marks of violence were found on the
body, ami it is the opinion of the autopsy
Dhysieian that death was caasei from
violent exertion. The excitement attend
ing the quarrel and the subsequent flight
of the dead woman from her nome
naturally stimulated, the heart's action,
and in its weakened condition it faltered,
then failed entirely and death took place.

It was an assemblage that had put on its
very best tea or reception-room calling
gown, and for the most part took off its
large feather-bedecked hats and listened
comfortably to the inspiring music while
it held its headgear in its lap.
The decollete was conspicuous by its
very absence. There were modest little
V's, and any number of pretty rounded
shoulders, that were just dimly visible
through the filmy, lacy bertha; but the
genuine low-cut bodice, exposing throat
and shoulders â not one was to be seen.
But for all that it was a pretty house,
a little mixed, but altogether pleasing to
the eye.
The audience had' come to hear the
stars, and merely listened with tolerance
to the overture of 'Euryanthe," played
by an orchestra conducted by Isidore
Luckstone. This Weber number, by the
way, is the stock overture at the Baldwin-
Theaier when a musical genius is about to
delight the public, and the habitues of the
ttieater know that they must take their
"Euryanthe" before they can get their so
loists.
Tue first soloist last night was J. C.
Dempsey, the bass of the Nordica-Scalchi
organization, wjio sang Mephistopheles'
senenade from the fourth act of Gounod's
"Faust." He has a smooth, pleasant,
well-placed voice, which lit used artisti
cally in a lyric way, tliough none of his
work was dramatic. The "Serenade" he
sang with an absence of the mocking,
devilish spirit with which portrayers of
Mephistopheles teneraUy in3p:re it, but
on the other hand his lyric rendering was
both appropriate and acceptable lor con
cert work, and one never expects operatic
selections on the concert stage to be inter
preted in their true spirit.
The audience showed hearty apprecia
tion for Mr. Demp?ey's rendering of the
"serenade," and in re-ponse to a demand
for an encore he sanjt "Drink to Me Only
Witu Tliine Eyes," and sang it very well,
though a little slowly. The basso's name
would lead one to suppose tiiat he is of
Hibernian extraction, but his pronuncia
tion of "Driak to Me Only Witu Thine
Eyes" was that of a Frenchman or an
Italian.
M me. Scalchi received such an ovation
on her appearance that she had to bow >
and bow ugain before she was permitted
to sing. At last the audience permuted
her to proceed, and she gave "Nobil'
Kignor,' 1 from "The Huguenots," which
only whetted the thirst of the hearers lor
more. In response to tumultuous ap
plause she sang "Annie Laurie," and as a
second encore the "Gavotte" from "'Mig
non."
The last number was the most delight
fully sung of all, tiiough Sealchl showed
herself to be still a gre&t artist in ail her
arias. Her voice shows decided signs of
wear, particularly in the lower notes of
the middle register, but she has many
beautiiui tones left and is still complete
mistress of her voice.
Baron Berthold, the tenor, sane; the
"l'r:zÂ« Song" from the "Meistersinger"
Â»id showed himself to be of the familiar
\VHgnerian.type, that is to say, Nature gave
him a tine voice, which he produces in
such a way as to jeopardize the continued
possession of it. His dramatic expression
scarcely atoned for the faulty production
of his voice, but he certainly threw him
self heart and soul into singing the beau
tiful "Prize Song" and received a warm
enrore.
Mme. Nordica's appearance was the
signal for a iieaiening burst of applause.
She wa" most becomingly dressed in a
combination of pink, black and helio
trope and wore her diamond tiara as ad
vertised. Nordica has gained somewhat
in flesh lately, but otherwise she has not
changed much in appearance. Her first
selection was a dramatic Hungarian aria
by a composer named Er&el.
Nordica sang it with great intensity
ana in a style which seemed almost un
necessarily violent for the concert stage,
though the W'agnerians were charmed
with her dramatic force. The aria was
evidently very difficult and its dramatic
qualities might appeal very strongly to
music lovers who knew it fairly well, but
last nieht it was unfamiliar to most of
the people present and was regarded
merely as a vehicle for the display of Nor
dicn's voice.
What it revealed was that she has
gained greatly as an interpreter of dra
matic works, but that her register is thin,
and there is too much effort in her dra
matic declaimation for the concert stage,
though in Wagnerian opera this appear
ance ol effort will, no doubt, entirely dis-
aj pear.
Nordica's aria was most enthusiastically
received, and as an encore she showed
her versatility by singing with charming
effect an old English song, 'When Love
Is Kind." This so delighted every one
that another encore was clamorously de
manded, and the diva sang a pretty
serenade composed ior her by Isadore
Luclistone.
The third act of Gounod's "Faust" con
cluded the programme. In this perform
ance the women bore off the honors.
fScalchi was delightful in the roles of
Hiebel and Martha, and Nordica showed
marvelouÂ» improvement in her interpre
tation of Marguerite. She was, in fact, to
the life the simple, guileless peasant girl,
struggling against an overmastering pas
sion which was too strong for her.
The slow degrees by which this passion
claimed Marguerite ior its own were most
subtly and artistically suggested. In her
singing Nordica scarcely once became
louder than mezza voce in "Faust," and
though the effect was tweet and artistic it
gave the impression that the heavy Wag
nerian roles she has been singing are be
ginning to wear Nordica's voice a little.
Dempsey was a fairly satisfactory
Mephiatopheles, but the Wagneriau
Barron Berthald was not quite in his
element as Faust and he entirely spoilt
the effeci of the "Salve Dimora" by in
dulging toward Its close in an unadulter
ated falsetto note, which did not deceive
any one.
Taken altogether, tlie performance wat
a great ?ncc<s. In response to a clamor
ous demand for more seats than the man
agement has to sell, It has been resolved
to give a farewpJl concert on Sunday night.
By special request Nordica will repeat her
Hungarian ana. She will also sing the
Bach-Gounod "Aye Maria," and the
quartet from "Rigoletto" will be given.

BIDDING THEM GOOD-BY
Farewell Reception to Captain
and Mrs. McFes Last
Evening.
Testimonial to th; Departing Salva
tionist Officer From Prominent
Citizens.
An enthusiastic farewell reception was
given Adjutant and Captain Joseph It.
McFee and also Mrs. McFee of the Salva
tion Army last evening at the department
headquarters, 1139 Market street.
The assembly-room of the headquarters
was crowded with the red-shirted soldiers
who had gathered to meet their comrades
for the last evening and by many citizens
who had met the two officers during their
six years' nctive work in this (Jity.
The platform was occupied by tho choir,
band and also by Brigadier-General Kep
pel, Captain and Mrs. McFee, Major W.
W. AVinchell and Mrs. Winchell, who
made during the usual religious exercises
stirring addresses, eacli followed by sonss
and a volley of handclapping. The lively
cnaracter of ihe nieetiti!; had more the
appearance of a jolly welcome than a fare
well, and Brigadier-General Keppel stated
for the benefit of strangers present that
Salvationists could be happy under all
circumstances.
The retiring officer spoke feelingly of
his six years' work in San Francisco, and
notwithstanding he bowed in cheerful
obedience to the order that directs him
to go away, he would go away wiih many
regrets at having to leave the soldiers and
citizens that had upheld his hands in the
army work.
At the close of the meeting the follow
inc testimonial was read to Captain Mc-
Fee by William M. Bunker, editor of tue
Daily Report :
San Francisco, CaL., Dec. 31. 1890.
Adjn(ant Joseph R. XtPtt, of the
Social Division, Salvation Armyâ Dear Sir: We
regret that the exigencies of the Salvation
Army service have impelled the army authori
ties to call you away Torn this Ciiy, and we
were untrue to the interests of humanity and
unmindful of the noble work done by you did
we fall to pny a proper tribute to your zeal,
efficiency and gouud sense in dealing with the
wrecks and results of pressing poverty. Citi
zens brought face to lace with imperative
demands from the Ktifiering poor have again
and .again successfully utilized your tact and
exporiencs, and on more than one occasion
the City has solved a public probieai of
poverty, through your advice and personal
endeavor.
Your removal from the City is therefore a
public loss, and while we realize that in the
Urger field, to which you have been called you
will find greater possibilities ior the exercise
of your patience, perseverance and unselfish
devotion, we shall not cease to regret that
your splendid services have been lost to us
and tnat your aid and counsel are beyond our
reach.
Very truly yours, William 11. Bunker, editor
and proprietor Daily Report and chairman
Citizens' Relief Committee of 1889-00-93-94;
L. R. Ellert, ex-Mayor; Adolph Sutro, ex-
Mftyor; P. Crowlev, Chief of Police; James D.

Charles Webb Howard, president Spring Val
ley Water Company ; Ltppman Stern ot Sachs

&Co.
Upon presenting the testimonial to Cap
tain McFee Mr. Bunker said it was not
only the iarowell word of the signers
thereof but of the entire people of Bun
Francisco. The Citizens' Relief commit
tees of 1889-90-93-91 would never have been
able to perform their work successfully
without the help and toe practical advice
of Captain McFee.
The captain answered that he was ready
anywhere and at any time to engage in
the same labors.
Captain and Mrs. McKee will leave for
the East this afternoon at 5 o'clock.

BANQUETED HIS FRIENDS
Hugo D. Keil Entertains the
Employes of Goldberg,
Bowen & Co.
A Pleasant Evening Spent in the
Cafe Zinkaad With Sengs, Ad
dresses and Recitations.
There was a pleasant gathering at the
Cafe Zinkand last eveningâ a gathering
where men who have labored for years to
gether met at the banquet table and ate,
drunk and made merry. They were the
employes oi Goldberg, Bowen & Co., and
the occasion was a sort of celebration of
the approaching marriage of one of their
number, Hugo D. Keil, who on the 26th is
to lead to the altar Miss Teen GoodaJl,
daughter of Captain Charles Goodall.
Mr. Keil was in truth the giver of the
feast, and nothing was spared from Mr.
Zinkand's larder and cellar. Mr. Keil has
been thirty odd years with the firm, and
has become endeared to all of his asso
ciates in the business, and all extended
the hearty hand of good wishes to him.
R. Scaly presided as toastmaster and
Mr. Keil as host. Mr. Goldberg made a
few remarks appropriate to the occasion.
Mr. Bowen, who was never known to
make a speech bsfore, delivered a neat
htile address, that was highly appreci
ated. A. L. Griffiths read an original
poem, while Henry Goldsmith and Asher
Davis sang several songs. G. M. Loner
gan performed an Irish jig. Mr. Zinkand,
who has known Mr. Keil since boyhood,
made a pleasant speech and extended the
best of wishes for the young man's future.
There were about sixty-fire of the firm's
employes present, among whom were the
following:
Hugo D. Keil, J. Goldberg, A. J. Bowen, G.
\V. Wnftuey, G. M. Lonergan, I. P. Johnston,
\V. B. Gray, C. E. Burton, Sam Bibo, R. Scaly,

IT'S CURES
THAT COUNT.
Many so-called .remedies are
pressed on the public attention
on account of their claimed
large sales. But sales cannot
determine values. Sales simply
argue good salesmen, shrewd
puffery, or enormous advertis-
ing. It's cures that count. It
is cures that are counted on by
Ayer's Sarsaparilla. Its sales
might be boasted. It has the

sales prove nothing. We point

ARE SEARCHING
FOR A MURDERER
Pilots on ths Gracie S
Expect to Capture
Butler.
At Dusk Last Night They Were
Chasing a Four-Masted
Ship.
Harbor Commissioners and Govern*
m?nt Officials at Oats Over a
Question of Rent.
Butler, the murderer, and the British
ship Swanhilda are still the principal
topic of conversation on the water front.
Two fonr-masted vessels are due from
Newcastle, N. S. W., and one of them is
.Â«ujiposed to l:ave been sighted by the
steamer Bio de Janeiro a few day 9 ago.
The pilot- boat Gracie S. is outside await
ing the advent of the lons-looked-for yes-
Bel, and should Captain Jordan board her
he will at once place the murderer under
arrest should he be aboard, as he and the
other captains have been sworn in as
United States deputy marshals, and the
â¢warrant for the arrest of Butler is on
board the pilot-boat.
At diibk last evening the pilot-boat was
standing up for a four-masted vessel that j
was to be seen in the distance. Attain the
waiting detectives at Jleigg* wharf were
all excitement, and the betting was as to
whether it was the Olivebank or Swan
liilda. Darkness fell before the vessel was
made out and it will be some time to-day
before her identity is disclosed. Should
she rrove to be the Swanhilda the dreary
waich kept by policemen and reporters at
Meiggs wharf will bo over, but it the ves
sel turns out to be the Olivebank the
"nisht- watch" may prove to-be indefinite.
Tue Harbor Commissioners met yester
day with Mr. Cole in the chair. President
Colnon and his family have gone to
Truckee for a few days in order to view
the ice carnival. Commissioners Cole and
Chadbourne were in attendance, however,
and the usual routine business was gcue
through with.
A couple ot weeks ago Postmaster Mc-
Coppin notified the board that the charge
for the quarters 01 station D was 100 high
and that the Government would not be
able to pay the rent. At ihe same time it
was pointed out that in Eastern cities the
rent paid was not neariv so high as the
amount demanded in San Francisco. Tne
matter has been thoroughly discussed by
â¦Messrs. Colnon, Cole and Chadbourne,
witn the result tnar a letter to the Post
master was formulated, concluding, alter
stating the situation:
All that is required of your depart
ment is the rental proportioned to the
<:hurge for similar space occupied by other
tenants. Thi^ charge, me commission thinks,
yhouid be $1000 per month, to include heat
ing. i-'Ut nut to include lighting. The lighting
of the entire building will be under the con
trol of this commission, such charge being
iiinde ngaiust each tenant as the meter may
show to be due according to a rate fixed to
cover cost merely.
The commission will also provide the apart
ments with the furnishing and accessor:eh in
dicated in your communication ol this day.
As it ;s jof the utmost importance thai tbe
matter should be seulel without demy, the
construction of the building being u<>w in
progiess. you are earnestly requested to pro
â¢â¢ure a decisive answer from tne Washington
officers as quickly as pos-ib!e and communi
cate the same ;o this board. Very truly yours,
J. J. Keeoan, Secretary.
At yesterday's meeting it was stated
that the central portion of the depot
would be finished inside of ten months,
and if the Government did not want ac
commodations for the Postoflice it should
say so at once, as the space set apart for
station 1) is wanted for other purposes.
Captain "Ned McCoy is to be the new
superintendent of the Spreckels Towboat
Company. He is a most able man, and
will provp a worthy successor to tr.e late
Captain Hawley. For several years Cap
tain McCoy has been in Oregon waters in
charge oi the tug Relief. He will be suc
ceeded by Camain Kandeil of the river
steamer Monticelio, and father of Captain
Clem Kandeil of the Fearless. Captain
Randell left yesterday for Astoria, nnd on
his arrival there Captain McCoy will come
to San Francisco.
The lighthouse inspectors have issued
the following:
Notice .is hereby given that the bell buoy !
marking Souza Hock, near the entrance to j
Port Harford, Cai., is ajuin iv good working I
ord er.
This notice affects the list of beacons and
buoys, Pacific Coast, 1895, page 14.
The members oi B'nai B'rith will take
an outing to Stockton next Saturday.
They have eneaced 100 staterooms on the |
steamer J. D. Peters and will leave at 6 j
p. m. They will have ali of Sunday-in the |
capital of San Joaquin County and will |
reach San Francisco again about 3 o'clock |
Monday morning.
Fears are entertained for the safety of i
the British steamer Kiaora (t:ood inck). i
She was built on the Clyde lor trade be- !
tween Auckland, N. Z., and the Thames
goldtields, but is now out over 200 days
from Glasgow and Lioyds has posted her j
as ruissing. About nine months ago Alex- j
ander McGregor, son of the owner, passed i
through here on his way to England to
inspect the vessel, and he was presumably !
on ooard. Tne Kiaora was a small vessel, I
but very fast and was exrected to make j
the run between the goidfields and her ]
home port in better time than any of the i
vessels on the route.
The steamer Monowai is takinp in 300 j
ions of coal from the British ship Forfar- |
shire. She had to take so much cargo in
at Sydney thp.t coal had to be left behind.
In consequence enough fuel has to be
taken on here to carry the vessel back
home.
Engineer Edward Pait has not been a j
success as a litieant. Some time ago j
Engineer John Stevens of the steamer |
Hope was taken sick and Pait was put in j
niÂ« place at so mticli per day. lie worked j
live daj's and Stevens returned. Pait de- i
raanded a month's wages and Piper, |
Aden, Goodall <fc Co. refused to pay him 'â 
lor more than Jive days' work. He j
nroutrht suit ami Justice Groezinger de- j
cided against him. The rase was appealed
and yesterday Judge Seawall sustained I
the lower court. Piper, Aden, Goodall & !
Co. fought the case on principle and they
are consequently pleased over the out
come, even ttiough there was only $15 in
volved.
The Governor has ordered Major-Gen
eral James to board the. steamer Australia
as POOD as she arrives from Honolulu. He
will represent the State and learn Mrs.
Willis' wishes in regard to the landing of
the late Minister's body. A guard of
honor accompanies the remains from
Honolulu and should Mrs. Willis v> desire
tne Governor will call out t:ie militia and

"NOBBY" CLARKE
RAISES A POINT
Asks to Have the Police
Pension Fund Declared
Insolvent.
Complaint That His Clients Have
Not Been Paid Money
Said to Bs Due
On the Other Hind the Commissioners
Sy They Are Right and Havj
More Than Money Enough.
Police Commissioners Tobin, Alvord and
Gunst and Chief Crowley awakened yester
day morning to find their hands tied. so far
as the management of the police pension
fund was concerned. Ttis startling state
of affairs was brought about because of a
suit instituted by Counselor Alfred Clarke,
familiarly known as "Nobby" Clarke, with
the ostensib'e purpose of having the police
pension fund declared insolvent.
Not only were ihe Po. ice Commissioners
prevented from taking any action in re
gard to the fund, but Auditor Broderick
and Treasurer Widber were served with
notices that they must neither receive nor
pay out money on account of the fund.
A great many quarterly payments were
due, and tne delay of even a day would
cause a great deal of uneasiness if not
actual discomfort to those entitled to pen
sions.
Mr. Clarke must have chuckled, for,
though he has brought nearly fifty suits
against toe Police Commissioners, he
never before succeeded in causing them
or their associates any inconvenience. It
was his first success so far as worrying the
opposition was concerned, and he was /or
a moment happy. But his joy was fleet
ing, for Deputy "City Attorney W. I. Bro
becu went before Presiding Judge Seuwell
and, after making a statement of the
facts, secured an order from tne court, set
ting aside the restraining order. The or
der to show cause why the fund should
not be declared insolvent still stan>ls,
however, and Mr. Clarke yesterday glee
fully announced that he intended to pre.ss
it to an early hearing.
The complaint that has at last suc
ceeded in disturbing the equanimity of
the Police Commissioners is a curiosity
from the lawyers' standpoint and is inter
esting to tne general reader.
Following his custom Mr. Clarke bases
bis bill in equity on the constitution of
the United fctatos.in this instance alleging
an invasion of the rights of his clients
as guaranteed to them under the pro
visions of the fourteenth amendment,
which provides that there shall bs no dis
crimination in regard to the rights and
privileges oi persons.
The bill in equity is entitled Fannie
Burgess and otners against the Police
Pension Fund â petition to have said fund
declared insolvent. Among those men
tioned as parlies to the proceeding nro:
Fannie Burgess, Mary A. Daley, Mary C.
Berges, Theresa M. Stevens, Hatiie De
laney. Pollen Burdttt, Elizabeth Magnin,
Alfred Clarke, administrator of the estate
of Alexander Grant.
The pleadings set forth the averment
that the defendant is a corporation and a
resident of this State and has been for
eight years engaged in the insurance busi
ness and that the said corporation is and
lor six months last past has Deen insolvent;
further tuat others have been illegally
paid money out oi the fund to the exclu
sion of the petitioners, thus discriminat
ing against them and depriving them of
rights guaranteed to them by the consti
tution of the United States.
The petitioners complain that on the
30th of last Septembi-r the Police Commis
sioners made a eift of $30 to J. F. Moran
with intent to hinder, delay and defraud
its creditors, and that in contemplation of
insolvency thÂ« Commissioners made a
further ei'ft of $170 to Moran.
The defendant corxiinission being a
hank and banker, tne petition avers, (ins
iailed for more than thirty days to pay
certain moneys deposited with it in a
liduciary capacity on demand of payment.
The liabilities of the defendantdfommis
fion for deaths in its membership exceed
$20,000, and the assets on January 14, 1897,
did not exceed $19,401 86.
The manager*, during the last eight

year?,- are accused of having paid out and
diverted a portion of the funds for their
own u~e, a suit being necessary to recover
] the same.
Mr. Clarke specifies that they paid to
i George Clinton $4U95 50, to Sheldon Pom-
I troy $1695 50, to K. P. Hammond Jr.
I fIOOO, to William E. Hail $1500, making a
; total of over $11,800.
The liabilities of the fund at this time
are said to exceed J37.C92, and that the as
sets do not exceed $19,462; so it is alleged
; that the defendant can now pay 52 cents
j on the dollar (or a shade less) on its lia-
I biluies.
Furthermore, it is declared that the in
j come in approximately $1100 a month and
the iiabilties $1000 a mouth.
Mr. Clark? adds that, there is no reason
j able probability that the defendant under
j its piesent management can recover a
solvent condition, and each month of its
continuance must result in an increase of
its accumulated insolvent debt by a
| monthly deficiency of $400.
T!ie most serious aik-gntion in tho bill
in equity is that the managers of tin- fiu.d
illegally paid It. P. Hammond Jr. $1000
on Use pretense that his father, formerly
a member of the Board of Police Cora mis
j sinners, with a salary of $250 a month, was
! insured in the fund, aitbougn he had
| never been a contributor thereto as .other
j beneficiaries of the fund had been. The
i fact ibat payment of a great many claims
I had been resisted by the Commissioners
is referred to by Mr. Clarke, who adds
that "the management while willing to
I litigate with widows, was puerile and
i timid in its dealings with men of political
i strength. It paid George Clinton $4093 54
i for pension from March 4, 1889, and the
' :Â»arne amount to Sheldon Pomeiov, under
j the pretended sanction of section 13 of the
j pension law."
At the office of the Police Commis
; sioners the latest suit is spoken of liehtly,
j though it i*! freely admitted that all per
! sons connected with the department are
j weary of Mr. Clarke's vexatious litiga
tion." It seems to be impossible to get rid
of him or shake him off in any way, un
less he finally runs out of causes for com
j plaint, which seems a hopeless outlook, as
I he has a fertile brain for conjuring up ex-
I cuses for damages. In addition to tho
I suits in the Stale courts Mr. Clarke has
about a dozen suits pending in the United
States courts.
At the office of the Police Commis
sioners it was stated yesterday that the
pension fund instead of being in danger
of insolvency has a big surplus every year.
Its sources of revenue are as follows:
Firstâ Not less than 5 nor more than 10 per
cent of all moneys collected and received from
licenses for the keeping of places wherein
spirituous, malt or other intoxicating liauors
are sold.
I Secondâ One-half of all moneys received
I irom taxe^ or from licenses U]Â»>n dogs.
Thirdâ Ail moneys received lrom tines im
posed upon nieinbiTi of Hie ponce force of
\ laid i oii'ity, city and county, city or town for
i violation o; the. rules and regulations of the
Police Department.
fourthâ Ail proceeds of sales of unclaimed
I property.
Filth â Kot less than one-fourth nor more
j than one-iialf of ail moneys teceived from li
censes irom pawnbrokers, billiard-hall keep
ers, second-hand dealers and junkstoree.
Sixthâ All moneys received from fines for
carrying concealed weapons.
Seventhâ Twenty-five per cent of all fines
collected in moiiey for violation of county,
city and county, city or town ordinances.
Eighthâ All rewards given or paid to mem
bers of suon police force, except such ai shall
be exespted i>y the Cliiei of Police.
Ninth â Two dollars a month from each mem
bur of the Police Department.
The direct receipts last year figured up
in this manner:
Contributions of officers .......,.$13,405 00
J-idps of officers...... . 2, 145 00
! Fines and forfeitures, Police courts tt,050 37
Sale of police effects.... 794 15
Total 185.3 M 52
This revenue, supplemented by the re
ceipts from the first, second and fiith
sources, yielded Â«o much that there was a
surplus of $20,000, which was conveyed
into the general fund of the City treasury.
Attorney Brobeck says that he has
made an investigation, and th.it he can
not see how the police pension fund can
ever fail to have a surplus of from $15,000
to $20,000 a year.
ilr. Clarke's ability to initiate litiga
tion, while it is boundless, seems to end
there, lie has not yet won a suit, and his
complaints have been knocked out by the
courts, one by one, at fast as reached.

THEY HOOTED
AT THE DEPUTY
A. G. Fletcher's Very
Rough Experience in
Cloverdale.
Bilter Opposition to Fish Com
missioners in Many
Localities.
Difficulty in Securing Convictions of
Persons Who Violate the
Game Law.
The experience of a Deputy Fish and
Game Commissioner is not always pleas
ant, and instead of receiving; encourage
ment in discharge of their duties in pro
tecting fish and game the3e officials
frequently have to contend with the
The Fish Trap That Deputy A.
G. Fletcher Took From a
Creek Near Cloverdale.
greatest obstacles and annoyances. Such
was the experience of Deputy A. G.
Fletcher in Cloverdalo recently. Word
was received at the Fish Commissioners'
office that there was a salmow trap in Sul
phur Creek, near Cloverd'ile, and he
started out to destroy the 'trap and arrest
the offenders, for it is against the law to
use such contrivances at any time or kill
salmon out of season.
After a considerable search along Sus
-pur Creek Fietcher found the trap. It was
crude, but effectual, for the purpose in
tended. It was made of willow suckers in
the shape of a huge waste-basket, and at
the mouth was a concave coyer with a
hole in the center, through which the fish
could pass. Once inside it was "good-by,
salmon." In fact, there was one salmon
in the trap when the deputy arrived. As
Mr. Fletcher wanted to arrest the offend
ers he secreted himself in the bushes on
the bank of the stream and waited. After
o. while two men armed with salmon speari
appeared, but before they reached tho trap
a third man appeared, who evidently
warned the two that the deputy was n^ar,
fcr he had seen the deputy in a buggy up
the road.
A little later a Sonoma In'ian ap
proached, and tlie men with the spears
told him there was n ii.sti in the trap, and
poor Lo fell a victim at once. While Mr.
Fletcher would have preferred to arrest
the white men he wa* compelled to arrest
the person who actually took the fish from
the trap. However, Mr. Fletcher took the
salmon spears Irom the two men and
broke the ugly implements to pieces.
Then he started for town with the pris
oner, who gave the name of Charlie La
moon, and the .-almoti :md the fishtrap.
The nipn whose spears he ha 1 oroken
preceded Mr. Fletcher, and by the time the
iattcr arrived in Clovordule the whole of
the tough element of the town was out
and gave him a hot leceptiotr. All kinds
of insuliins remarks were made. Trie
prisoner was duly charged with violating
the game law and the fish and trap were
deposited in Justice of the Peace Connor's
office.
Then the trouble began in earnest. By
tne tway, Mr. Fletcher learned that the
names of the two men whose spears he
had broken were Charles McPherson and
Walter McPherson, his cou-in. All that
day a gaiic of town hoodlums followed
Mr. Fletcher and saluted him with rish-'
horns. When he sat, in the hotel the
gang, led by the McPhersons, appeared at
the windows and tooted U.eir tin horns.
Once, when he was on the street, one of
the party showed an inclination to rise a
horsewhip on Mr. Fletcher; but he did
not carry out his intentions. While the
deputy is small in stature, he has plenty
of pluck, and iho lirst blow from a whip
would have been preliminary to a luneral
in Cloverdale. Before the case against
the Indian came up for trial Charles Me-
Pher. j on, on the rdvise of a practitioner of
the law named Uoyl, swore out a com
plaint against the deputy for malicious
mischief for breaking the fi>h ppenrs, but
Mr. Fletcher was released on bail. The
singular feature is that Judpe Connor
issued the warrant for the arrest of a State
officer without first submitting the com
plaint to the District Attorney of the
county.
When the case of the Indian came np
for trial it was found that some one had
stolen tde fish from the sack and substi
tuted a log of wood. The irap too had
been broken. All sort of technicalities
marked the Course of the trial, but the
confession of the Lndian in an unguarded
moment that he had taken the fish in the
stream settled the case, and he was held
for trial in the Superior Court. Justice
Connor, however, volunteered ihe remark
that his sympathy was with the offender,
and that he would not have held him but
for the confession.
At the trial the two McPhersons swore
that they did not see any fish in the trap.
Deputy Fieicher, however, found several
who .^aid thnt they would make affidavit
that the McPhersons had told opeuly of
having seen the salmon. When this was
learned the deputy made preparations for
several arrests for perjury, but he has not
made them yet. Yesterday he learned
that the charge against himself had been
dismissed by the District Attorney. He
said that this is frequently the experience
of deputies who endeavor to enforce the
canie laws in the country.

DAVIS BROS.
CAUSE SURPRISE
The Golden Rule Bazaar
Passes Into Other
Hands.
Their . Partnership Will Expire
During This Month by
Limitation.
Affairs Prosperous and Personal Re
lations Cordial, but a Cash
on Equities.
The dissolution of the partnership of
Davis Bros, of the Golden Rule Bazaar
after twenty-six years of unprecedented
business success, will call forth only ex
pressions of regret from the community.
The business was started in 1871 by the
brothers Ansley, Eugene and Andrew in
a very modest way at 419 Kearny street.
Their push and business enterprise were
manifest from the start. They established
numerous branches of their business in
this City and elsewhere.
In 188S Eugene retired irom the firm,
and now the brothers Ansley and An
drew's partnership having dissolved by
limitation and tte.y being unable to agree
as to the manner of liquidation, it was
deemed best to select three weil-known
and influential men to act as liquidators,
and so the Golden Rule Bazaar passes
into other bands.
The Golden Rule Bazaar has always
been a most popular store, and it will
doubtless lose none of its popularity under
the new management. The force con
stantly employed at their places of busi
ness numbers from 150 to 600 employes,
according to the seasons of the year.
An arrangement was perfected on Mon
day by which the business and good will
of Davis Bros, was purchased by a cor
poration consisting of W. P. Morgan of
the Meridea Britannia Company, Albert
Meyer of Daniel Meyer & Co. and Gustave
Frederick, cashier of the London and San
Francisco Bank, and yesterday the new
owners took possession.
The liquidation of the old firm will pro
ceed as rapidly as possible, and all the
affairs of Davis Bros, will be adjusted by
f Messrs. Morgan, Meyer & Frederick.
Cards have ueen sent out to all the cred
itors stating that their bills will be paid as
! faÂ«t as they fail due.
It was learned from one connected with
I the linn that the assets will exceed the
j liabilities by at least $300,000. This shows
| conc.usively that its condition was most
prosperous.
The brothers have not been able to agree
on lines of policy and management for
some time, but this lack of harmony was
not of a personal nature. Tneir views a*
10 their respective interests were diverse,
and rather than go to law and have the
property pass into the hands of a receiver
they decided to have the gentlemen men
tioned act as liquidators.
Andrew Davis was seen at the residence
jof his brother-in-law, Attorney A. F.
Benjamin, at 2712 Pine street, and made
the loilowing statement on the condition
of affairs:
â¢'The co-partnership existing between
my brother Ansley and myself expired by
limitation this month. For over a year
we have Leen discussing the question of a
settlement. My brother owned the larger
share, and the only difficulty that arose
was in the matter of a vroper settlement.
"On this we did not disagree, strictly
speaking, but merely were unable to agree
in regard to the equities of the firm's
property. The trouble was not of a per
sonal nature, and to-day the relations ex
isting between U3 areas cordial as ever.
"We did not care, however, to perpet
uate the partnership, and each wa.Â« will
ing to buy the other out, but the different
valuations we both placed on the store
and its fixtures rendered this impossible.
So we turned the property over to Messrs.
Morgan, Meyer and FredericJc to act as
liquidators.
"They virtually own everything now.
When the property is sold my brother
and I will receive our share?. It is not
improbable that one or the other of us
may purchase the store and fixtures of
the firm and continue in business at the
old stand."

of San Francisco.
, Gentlemen: The present conditions
"* connected with the quarantine estab
lishment at this port are well known to
you as unjust and objectionable to all
ships arriving from foreign ports. This
Chamber of Commerce has for year* con
tended that the quarantine service
should be under Federal control at all
United States ports, and has been
pleased to observe the acceptance of
this view in actual practice. Thus we
have now both a Federal and a State
quarantine service at this port, only re
cently in contention with each other as
to their respective rights.
The controlling: factor, however, is
that the Collector of Customs will recog
nize only the certificate of the United
States quarantine officer and ignores
that of the State. The former service is
rendered free of cost, while the latter iÂ« â 
charged against the ships. The State
Government possesses no quarantine
facilities, while the United States has a
properly equipped station. The State
service is worthless for the public good,
nail an unnecessary tax on an interest
already unjustly burdened with taxa
tion. The delay, annoyance and at times
danger of two stoppages at or near the
entrance of the port is also a serious and
proper cause of complaint on the part of
shipowners, pilots and master*. An
effort will be made to have the State [
quarantine law repealed at the present
session- of the Legislature. In the un- '
certainty of success in obtaining repeal I
we respectfully suggest that parties in
interest apply a prompt remedy by a
joint refusal to pay the State quarantine

and m just exaction on our maritime
commerce.

The State quarantine service must be
done away with as a superfluous and ex
pensive institution. Money must be
saved on the water front by limiting the
payroll in charge of the Harbor Commis
sioners to 10 per cent of the revenues. A
life-saving station must be estahlished
near dangerous Point Arena.
Such are the reforms that were advo
COSMOS CLUB
WILL SOON MOVE
Lease of a Fine Building
Owned by the Fair
i Estate.
The New Quarters in Every
Way Suitable ior Club
Purposes.
Will Remove From the Old Building
Early in Marchâ lncrease in
Membership
At a well-attended meeting of the mem
bers of the Cosmos Club, 317 Powell street,
last night, it was almost unanimously de
cided to confirm the arrangement entered
into by an authorized committee, under
which the club will shortly move into the
handsome building at 1534 Sutter street,
corner of Oct&via. The building in ques
tion is owned by the Fair estate, and as
recently as last June was occupied by the
Lake School.
This new departure on the part of the
Cosmos Club has been contemplated for
some time past, and is justified by various
pood and sufficient reasons. In the first
j'ace the location of the Sutter-street
i>u;lding makes it eminently desirable for
W-e purposes of a quiet, refined club, such
a\ the Cosmos ia admitted to be. Its
proximity to t:ie best residential portion
of the City will appeal to a wide circle of
those sociably disuo'-ed persons who are
prevented by family responsibilities from
coming downtown in the evening. The
convenient situation of the new building
will make it possible tor the paterfamilias
to enjoy a smoke and a quiet game of
billiards among his male friends, and re
cated and resolved upon by the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce yesterday
afternoon. It was the annual meeting of
the organization and it was also the in
itial meeting of the year.
Other interesting matters came up for
discussion, and before the meeting ad
journed a lively and significant tilt ensued
over an attempt by a strong element in
the assemblage to lay aside all proDOsed
resolutions in a bunch for the purpose,
as it later appeared, of preventing action
on certain measuresâ among them the
promotion of a water-front- belt-line rail
road calculated to facilitate and expedite
traffic and save to the producer and the
manufacturer the delays and expenses
incident io other means of transfer be
tween railroads and ships.
The president made an address, in
which he commented upon many things
of moment to the shipping, marine and
commercial interests of San Francisco
and its future as a maritime city of in
creasing importance.
He spoke of the immediate r>rospect of
a naval training tchool on Goat Island
and of a lightship and adequate signals
to be placed on the bar at the entrance to
the Golden Gate.
But his most radioal suggestions wore
with respect to the abolishment of port
quarantine dues and the service that
tuxes shipping here for perfunctory quar
antine inspection. The resolution on the
subject as adopted by the board is printed
herewith.
Last year it seems that 37)^ per cent
; of the revenues of the Han>or Commis-
I sion were expended in salaries. A special
I committee reported yesterday in favor of
a regime whereby ordinary business-like
thrift might be observed and money
saved that could be devoted to water
front improvements.
The. following resolutions were adopted
looking to a curtailment of expenses on
the front:
Jicsolved, That section 2552 be amended to
rend as tollows: The monthly salaries of the
i officers of ike State Board oi| Harbor Commis-
I sioners shall be as follows;
! The president. $300; two Commissioners, each,
I Â«2W.
And tt-ey shall have power to appoint to serve
1 during the pleasure of the board such assist
ants as may be absolutely uecessary, and no
more, at salaries not to exceed the following:
i Secretary, $250: assistant secretary, 9100; at
; ton;ey, $-00; chief engineer, $250; assistant en
i tm. i r, ;f; (JO: chief wliartingvr, stC'SU; assistant.
i wbariinsers, $100; collectors, 975: common la
; borers, per day, ?-; clerks, per mouth, $75.
And in no event shall any salary be higher
I thau what is paid by average respectable
1 business houses for the same class of labor;
; nnd provided, also, that the total amount ot
I money paid out tor salaries of Commissioners
and employes, fuel, rent, printing, stationery
ana office expenses of every kina nnd nature
< shall not exceed in all more than 10 per cent
|of the current revenue received lrom the
water front. And provided, also^hat tripli
cate copies of the report now required by law
! be made to the Controller before the sth of
each month, giving a fu>l detailed account of
the receipts and disbursements of their office
for the previous month, to the ena that the
Mayor of San Francisco and the president ot
the Chamber of Commerce s hail each reciive
a copy mon inly.
Â£(so!v<d. That it Is the bonnden duty of the
present legislature now assembled to cause
a thorough investigation to De made into the
â  present and Dast conduct of the Board of State
Harbor Commissioners, through a competent
, committee, and to proceed against them and
their bondsmen legally should they have
violated their trust or have wasted the public
. funds.
A resolution approving the general prin
ciple of arbitration in all international
differences and contentions was adopted
and ordered sent to Congress with an ac
companying explanation that the princi
ple should bs applied by special arbitra
tors appointed by parties to each dispute
rather than by a permanent body, and
furthermore that no questions affecting
the Monroe doctrine should be submitted
to aroitration as that doctrine should be
maintained as indispensable to the peace
and saiety of this country.
The establishment near Point Arena ot
a life-saving station was urged upon the
Government in the following expressions
which were approved and ordered tent to
the Secretary 01 the Treasury:
The Chamber of Commerce respectfully
calls to your attention the urgent need of a
liie-saviug station just norm of and near
Point Arena, coast ot Northern California.
Several vessels have been wrecked near the
dangerous headland, in tne vicinity of which
the occau currents are known to be strong
and irregular. Among them we recall the
bark Hyack, the ship E. Buckley, the steam
ship Kastport, the schooner James Townseud,
the schooner Ocean Spray, and the .scnooner
Ida Florence. In tne cases ol the last two
vessels mentioned the entire crews were lost.
The late wreck by stranding near Point
Arena o( the splendid steamsiiip San Benito,
with the loss of s'.x lives, resulting from the
absence of life-savins; apparatus on the coast,
is a most urgent argument for the life-saving
station we request.
In his annual address President Hugh
Craig spoke briefly in review of the tilings
accomplished by the Chamber of Com
merce during the past y-ar and com
mented hopefully upon pending and future
reiorras calculated to be of advantage to
this port and to its commercial prosperity
He said that during the loriy-seventn
year of the organization just completed
the officers and trustees or the chamber
had given consideration to many of the
interests germane to commerce. He de
nounced the State quarantine service as
superfluous and expensive.
Continuing, he said the proposed Ha
waiian cable is yet in the future, but a bill
iÂ« now before Congress which, if pasÂ«ed,
will secure the much needed telegraphic
connection. The British are moving rap
idly to establish a Pacific Ocean cable
under their own control. He mentioned
turn to his own rcoftree at a reasonable
hour, and without fear of undergoing a
Caudle curtain-lecture.
Tbe new building is also much larger
and more comfortable in its architectural
appointments than that on Powell street.
It, contains thirty-one living and sleeping
rooms, in addition to spacious parlors,
dining and reading rooms. Several neces
sary and somewhat elaborate improve
ments will be made on the main and din
ing-room floors wJiicli, when completed,
wiil transform the building into one o? the
finest evening clubs in the City.
"The proposition wi.icn we submitted
to the trustees of the Fair estate," said
Secretary Hart last niijht, "was confirmed
by the court last Saturday, and ail the
other details in connection with the lease
were concluded this afternoon.
"The proposed chnnges in the internal
arrangements will be undertaken with me
consent and approval o! the architect, Mr.
b'chiillz, and will in no way impair the
strength and durability of the building.
We expect to be ready to move by March
1 next."
The club's removal to its new home will
doubtless result in an increased member
ship. As a matter of fact, twenty appli
cations have already been received, and
more are expected to follow. The present
membership of tne Cosmos Club is 123 in
the City alone, and this number does
not include many army and navy mem
bers who make the club their headquarters
when in town.
The terms of the lease are not known,
buL that they must be satisfactory to the
lessees goes without paying.
THE PEEEY POSTOPFICE.
The Government Must Soon Select Its
Space or Lose It.
Postmaster McCoppin feels much en -
couraged over the prospect of a Dew home
for the lerrj postoffice.
"The Harbor Commissioners want a
rental of $1000 a month," said he .yester
day, "for about 13,000 square feet, with
elevators and steam heat, but First As
sistant Postmaster-General Jones thinks
this is too much. This sum is about 90
cents a square toot, whereas in Chicago
the Government pays 50 cents a foot for
the same space."
The matter must be decided soon, for if
the building be finished without reference
to Federal rules it will be too late to get
the required space.
Doctors Want Bodies.
Coroner Hawkins yesterday received a re
auest from the College of Physicians and Sur
geons for all unclaimed bodies. He reiuned 10
surrender any bodies until he can see whether
he Is authorized to do so by the law.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1897.
the favorable outlook in CoDgress for the
Nicaragua canal bill.
As to the prospective naval school on
Goat Island, in San Francisco Bay, he as
serted that with the able assistance of
Senator Perkins its establishment in the
near future is assured. Already 100 Atueri
can boys are enlisted on board the receiv
ing ship Independence at Mare Island
awaiting the oponing of the school, for
which the steam frigate Pensacola will be
fitted, while the United States ship Adams
has been detailed to make two practice
cruNes each year.
An improvement to the ship channel to
Mare Island Navy-yard ne declared to be
an urgent necessity and a precaution for
safe navigation, for which an appropria
tion should be asked of Congress.
A lightship and fog signal at San Fran
cisco bar should be established before next
winter, an appropriation of $80,000 having
already been obtained for thai purpose.
He spoke with satisfaction of the work
now in progress of resounding and ex
amining the bay, and commented approv
ingly upon the conduct of affairs by the
steamship examiners.
In conclusion he said some favorable
things of the work of the Bureau of For
eign Commerce, the Guatemala Exposi
| tion, the Merchants' Association as an
I evidence of growing civic pride, and other
organizations publicly associated with
commerce.
Captain W. L. Merry as secretary re
ported that the membership had steadily
increased, thoueh not to tne "extent it
might under more favorable constitutional
provisions for admission. The corre
spondence of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce, he said, now comes from all
parts of tin world, and its influence at
Washington is second only to that of the
Chambers of Commerce of New York and
Boston. The library oad been increased
by eighty- four volumes.
The successful establishment of a car
rier-pigeon service with the Farrallon
Islands was characterized as the next beat
thing to a marine cabie.
The board of examiners on steamship
and navigation had reported the admis
sion on examination during the past, year
of thirty masters and live chief officers.
In this connection it was remarked that
shipmasters are encouraging candidates
for promotion who have pursued regular
courses in the schools of navigation. Re
gret was expressed that notwithstanding
the great importance of this as a mari
time City, no instruction in'navigation or
[ its allied branches can be had in the pub-
I lie schools.
The treasurer's report showed that
' : $4928 had been collected and $3452 74 ex
| pended during the year.
The report of the election committee
was read. It announced the election of
the following: President, Hugh Craig;
first vice-president, John L. Howard;
I second vice-president, Louis B. Parrott;
i trusteesâ Louis Sloss Jr., Charles M.Yates,
| George A. Newhall, Charles Nelson, Wil-
I Ham E. Mighell, A. G. Towne, A. Gerber
j dine, Leon Blum, Edward Coieman, Oscar
| T. Sewall, O. B. Field and W. L. Merry.
| The committee consisted of J. Metcalfe,
W. W. Montague, A. H. Herriman and
i James Jerome.
The principal business of the meeting
then began i;i earnest, and a number of
; printed and other resolutions were pre
| sented, some of which were intended to
1 be sent to the State Legislature.
Some one at the back of the room
moved that they all be laid on the table.
The motion carried and was followed by
parliamentary parrying that resulted
j eventually in the resolutions being
j brought up separately, to the evident
j discomfiture of ti.e prevailing element,
I thai had evidently hoped to keep certain
! subjecis in the background.
During the argument raised by the
' opposition, that the whole report having
i been laid aside it was not parliamentary
I to take the resolutions up separately, Mr.
"Williams asked why the chamber did not
vote on the question and so declare its
meaning. 'What was the use of squab
bling about a parliamentary regulation
but half understood? He contended that
they were not running the chamber upon
exclusively parliamentary lines. The
i question before them was simply as to
I whether the water front was being con
dueled economically and in a manner
conducive to the benefit of San Francisco.
; He saw no object in delaying a vote.
The resolution was thereupon carried
i viva voce.
Mr. Corrwall rose to a point of order
i and asserted that the chamber was pro
j ceeding outside i^s own rules adopted in
; earlier days, and that it could not take up
| and pass resolutions seriatim after laying
I the same upon the table.
The chairman decided that the point
was not well taken, and Mr. Cornwall's
â¢ subsequent appeal from that ruling was
I deieated by a vote of 14 to 4.
Julian bonntag then moved that the
resolutions not included in the printed
| rerjorl be taken up and acted upon by the
I chamber. The motion was carried.
The first of these resolutions referring
I to the construction of a belt-line road was
j read by the secretary, and a long discus
i sion followed.
James McNab said the report under
: which that resolution nad been drawn
; having been laid on the table, the resoln
| tion itself was deprived of all force. Thii
; resolution was of a general character and
stated somewhat indefinitely thatthe belt
line road should be extended. He ques
tioned the importance of that proposition,
and it was for the committee to determine
whether it \vas advisable to cut up the
water front for the trifling benefit which
would accrue from the construction of the
I road. He argued that the present lacili
SHE HIS TWO HUSBANDS.
Peculiar Predicament of Mrs.
Mary Thiery and Her Two
Spouses. |
Becoming Despondent She Attempted
to Commit Suicide by Shoot*
ing Hersilf
Mrs. Mary Thiery attempted to commit
suicide last tiight by tiring a bullet into
her left breast. Thinking she was going
to die she told a sensitional story of being
married to two men, and for years neither
knew that the other had any claim upon
her.
Mrs. Thiery keeps a lodging-house at
828 Howard street. Her husband. Charles
Thiery, who is employed at Wieland's
brewery, accused her oi being unfaithful
to him.
The wound, although serious, will not
probably prove fatal.
Believing that she was about to die,
Mrs. Thiery told the strange story of her
life, and did not appear to think she had
done anything wrong by marrying two
men.
"I was married in Germany nineteen
years asro," she said, "to Charle3 Thiery.
About three years afterward we came to
this City, and after being here for a year
or so my husband went to the country.
"1 felt lonely, and, not hearing from
him for some months, I thought he was
either dead or had deserted in â >, so I went
witli Andy Briegle, a friend, to a Su
perior Judge, and we were married.
"Some time after Thiery returned, and
Briegle hud to leave me. I begged him
not to say anything about being married
to mo, and he promised. Since then he
has been visiting me, and about three
years ago my husband became jealous of
him, and I thought it better to tell him
what 1 had done during his absence.
"Bnegle would no*, stay away from the
house, out he was careful not to call upon
me while my husband was at home. He
threatened to claim me as his wife if I
forbade him 10 visit me.
"My life has been made miserable by
the two men and the talk of my neigh
bors, and I hope I will die."
Thiery called at the hospital to inquire
about his wife, and continued her story
ties were quite sufficient for immediate
purposes and tliut the railway company
already had a belt-line road at the north
ern portion of the City, to which its cars
could without difficulty be transported
from the southern end of town.
Julian Sonntng spoke of the proposed
line as the most important matter upon
which the chamber couid act at the pres
ent time. It was a well-known facl tnat
a bill would be introduced into the Legis
lature during the present session to estab
lish a free market in San Francisco.
Fruit-growers and other producers had
hitherto been everlastingly taxed by
middlemen and merchants, with the re
sult that they had generally come out at
the small end of the horn.
The bill would probably receive favor
able consideration at the hands of the
Legislature, and in that event a bek-line
road wouid be necessary, inasmuch as it
was provided that the market must be
located where water craft couid reach it,
and also that there must be facilities for
rail and other methods of conveyance.
The producers of California who would be
materially aided by this, measure could
not permit their produce to be carted
away from Third and Townsend streets
over cobblestones, to be ruined before
reaching the market.
James McNab repeated his previous ar
gument that cars could already be loaded
at the north end of the town without ad
ditional delay. There was a belt-iine road
at the north "end, connected by both broad
and narrow gauge tracks, and the delivery
of cars might easily be arranged for. To
cut up the present limited wharfage facili
ties would be a great disadvantage to the
shipping interests of the entire water
front.
R. G. Sneath reminded the chamber that
Mr. McNab's drays and wagons were
largely employed lor freight delivery pur
poses under the present system.
The resolution and report had been
drafted on general principles and there
was no question but that if from half a
million to a million could be saved an
nually by the extension of the road busi
ness should be done with that object in
view. The present system was very old
fashioned, and it would be as reasonable
to revert to thi omnibus on Market street
as to encourage the continuance of the
present method of wagon hauling. As it
was, manufactures could not be estab
lished at the north and south ends of the
town outside the cartage limits, because the
expense involved wa3 too great. Accord
ing to a carefully made estimate upward
of 12,000,000 tons of freight were moving
in and out of the City every year, and if
they saved only a few cents per ton upon
tha"t~ quantity it represented a large
amount of money.
"The Southern Pacific," Mr. Sneath
concluded, "hal formerly objected to
putting on a boat to lake cars round by
water, because they feared there would
not always be sufficient freight to warrant
that action."
James McNab said that Mr. Sneath had
tried to make it appear as if he â MeN abâ
was personally interested in this question,
owing to the nature of his business.
"It appears so to him," continued Mr.
McNab, "because ne has a magnified idea
of the amount of transportation across
town. I don't know where he gets his
basis for the number of tons conveyed,
but from 111 v personal knowledge I can
state that 9H per cent of it is imaginary."
Mr. McNab, replying to a question
raised by Mr. Sneath, affirmed tnat cars
could be carried to the north end of the
City from the Oakland pier direct, and
would never have to go near Fourth and
Townsend streets. He further stated tHat
the railway company actually made appli
cation to the Harbor Commissioners a iew
months ago for permission to deliver cars
at the north end of town, but were op
posed by some shijipins; people in that
vicinity.
Mr. Cornwall directed attention to the
fact that there is now a alip at the north
ern end of the Cityâ Yallejo street, where
the railway company lands I.oth broad
and narrow gauge cars. The railway had
secured quite a large piece of property
there from the Harbor Commissioners,
upon which they stored quantities of
freight everyday. All freight from the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys
could be brought to the norm end of the
City, landed and distributed.
On division the resolution was lost by a
vots of 10 to 7.
The remaining resolutions referred to
in Mr. Sonntag's motion were adopted
without debate. This concludel the reg
ular business of ths chambe r.
Dr. Stallard, the author of a series of
articles upon municipal government now
being published in the Overland Monthly,
was then introduced by the president, and
delivered a thoughtful and interesting ad
dress, in which he urged some powerful
reasons why the present system of harbor
management by Commissioners must al
wnys prove unsatisfactory. For a more
extended discussion of these questions he
directed the attention of his hearers to his
published articles.
As the only economical and efficient
substitute for control by commissioners,
Dr. Stallard advocated the municipal
ownership of such utilities. He stated
that Glasgow had thereby secured the
most successful harbor administration in
the world. The great dockyards, shipyards
and harbor railways ot that city were all
the property of the municipality, and he
insisted that in no other way could San
Francisco acquire a properly managed
belt-line road, which he admitted was a
serious necessity.
The meeting then adjourned.

CLAUS SPRECKELS
ON THE SANTA FE
Says the Valley Road Ex
pects to Connect
With It.
This Country Can Produce All the
Sugar the People Could
Consume.
Surveying Parties Still in th 3 Field
Between San Francisco and
Stockton.
The San Francisco and San Jcaquin
Valley Railroad is steadily proceeding
with the work of preliminary surveys be
tween the bay and Stockton. Tne survey
ing parties are not large, but they are of
ample size to do the first necessary work.
No surveys for grades are being made,
tiuch surveys will not be made till it is de
cided which one of the several routes
under consideration is the best for all
purposes of tne railroad. The parties now
out are simply making a roujh survey
and examination of the country, and when
a route is finally chosen, a large party will
be sent out, and the survey made with no
more consumption of time than is neces
sary lor good work. Even after the choice
of route is made, rights of way must be
secured, and, as Chief Engineer Storey
said yesterday, it may take considerable
time yet until the company is in a posi
tion toannounce the route of the proposed
extension Irom Stockton to San Francisco.
If the route known as the Kennedy sur
vey, made some years atro for the now
abandoned San Francisco and Great Salt
Lake line, were selected, Engineer Storey
said considerable time would be saved,
but. that in case that route be decided on,
and the railroad come through Fruitvale
down to a point south of the Oakland
narrow-gauge pier, the old survey will
have to be entirely gone over again and
some changes made.
Preliminary examinations and rough
surveys must be made back of all the
points on the bay which the company has
under consideration as a possible terminal.
These points are San Pablo. Malate, Dum
barton Point and Richmond.
Clans Spreckels, president of the San
Joaqnin Valley railroad, was seen yester
day by a Call reporter and asked concern
ing the alliance with the Atchison, To
peka and Sania Fe Railroad by connection
with the Atlantic and Pacific Kailroad-at
Mojave. Mr. fepreckles said :
"I do not like to talk to newspaper
men on this or any other subject."
'What do you think of Vice-President
Watt's statement concerning connection
with the Santa Fe as published in The
Call last Sunday ?"
"It' 3 all right; it's correct. That is all I
have to say.
Vice-President Watt said the Valley
road proposes to effect an Eastern connec
tion with the Santa Fe.
The Atlantic and Pacific Raih oad is to
be sold some day this montn. It is the
connecting link between the Santa Fe and
the Valley road. It extends from Albu
querque, N. Mei., to Mojave, Cal., and
the Santa Fe people cave for some time
been buying up all they could get of the
$16,000,000 of Atlantic and Pacific bonds.
The Valley road will be extended to
Bakersfield* probably by June next, and
there remains only v stretch of forty-two
miles of railroad to be built from Bakers
tield to Mojave to connect the two roads.
Wiien tlae connecting spike i 3 driven
California will have a transcontinental
cojupeting railroad. It is said to be highly
probable that this spike will be driveu in
side of a year.
The proposed route from Madera, with
entrance to San Francisco and China
Basin, will be surveyed also when the con
nection with the banta Fe is effected.
Mr. Spreckels was also askod if the Val
ley Railroad would be extended to Wat
sonviile. He said it would not for the
present. When asked concerning the
proposed increase of the tariff on sugar,
Mr. Spreckels said that California at pres
ent might not be able to produce all the
sugar that is annually consumed in tnis
country, but that the United States could.
THE LADDER SLIPPED.
A. H. Gangs Precipitated Through the
"Window of a Restaurant on
Market street.
A. H. Gauss, a young man 22 years of
age, met with a painful accident yester
day, and as it was he had a fortunate es
cape from more serious injuries.
He was standing on a step-ladder clean
ing the window of a restaurant on AlarKet
street, between Fifth and Sixth, when the
ladder slipped. He was precipitated
through the window, and his right hand
and wrist were badly cut by the broken
glass. A piece of class entered his wrist,
and was forced downward to the paMm of
his hand, and Dr. Bunnell had to cut it
out at the Receiving Hospital. There
were altogether six wounds on his hand
and wrist, and a ring that he wore on his
little ringer was cut through.
Gauss is a young fellow of good educa
tion. His family reside in Chicago, where
ne was employed in the office of the
Phoenix Insurance Company. He was in
duced to come here a iew months ago,
anci, being unable to procure a situation,
his funds became exhausted, and he wa. I
glad to do odd jobs around the restaurant.
Dr. Bunnell telegraphed to Gauss'
father in Chicago, informing him of the
accident, and i-uggesting that some funds
should be sent him.
Teacher* on the Retired List.
Mrs. Josephine E. Gerichten aud Miss Eliza
ceth M. Molloy have been placed on the list of
those entitled to draw quarterly allowances
from the teachers' retirement lund by the
Board 01 School Teachers' Retirement Fund

Treasurer Widber. Mrs. Gerichten has bf-en in
the service twenty-two years and Miss Molloy
twenty-nine years. The board also audited
the quarterly payments of other teachers on
the list, which run from $135 to $150 per
quarter.

. " Almost with the regularity of clock-work," said the editor of a New York trade paper,
when relating bis experience with ...........
Ripans-Tabules
*' I used to feel at about 11 o'clock that something had gone wrong with ray breakfast.
Especially was this true if I had had a restless night, as you know is not an uncommon
thing with head-workers. My stomach,'' continued he, "is under the standard as to
strength and it used to seem at those times to act only indifferently and sometimes to even
â¢top work. Clouds would come before my vision and then a slight nausea would be felt.
Years of that sort of thing had made me know the symptoms as well as I know my name, .
but since I learned about RipansTabules I have practically overcome the difficulty and "
it is not often that any one gets as enthusiastic over anything as I do over them. Now-
*. adays, whenever I recognize the old â¢familiar symptom, .'.'
DOWN GOES ONE OF THE BLESSED LITTLE CONCENTRATED BOONS,
And in a few minutes the visual clouds Kft, discomfort passes away, my stomach
apparently resumes its operations and at half past 12 or 1 o'clock I go out for mv usual â¢
rather hearty luncheonâ all in delightful contrast with my former practically ruined
â¢?, ; . afternoons which I used vainly to seek to escape by fasting and various doses.''

The Fireman's Fund Insurance Company paid a
quarterly dividend of 93 per share yesterday.
.An official letter from the Chollar mine says of
the work during the past week in the company's
ground on the Brunswick lode: "At shaft 1 on
the 600 level have timbered the chutes and are
now cutting the station. On the 200 and 300 levels
continue to raise on the ore streaks exposed and
to open lengthwise on them with no special chance
to report for the wees. The pay is narrow, out of
good grade. The raise on the east streak from 300
level is progressing slowly, the ground being quite
herd. On the 400 level the raise from the south
drift, from east crosscut i is up 15 feet, where are
raising in two se.s, the quartz at that poln: being 5
feet wide, the face samples going from 916 to $25
per ion. Knst crosscut 3 100 feet south of No. â * is
out 72 feel, having been advanced 35 feet for the
week. The fate continues in porphyry and small
seams or quartz. NVost croi-acut 3 opposite No. 3
U out 110 feet, having been advanced 33 feet since
last report. The face is in porphyry. Have saved
from all points for the week 115 tons 1200 pounds
of ore. which has been shipped to the Nevada mill
for reduction. The average top car sample for the
week was: Gold $28 76, ounces of stiver 1H.23.
The average wason sample was ?'.B 89 gold. 19.01
ounces silver, and the average battery sample of
the ore milled was B*6 69 gold. 16.96 ounces sil
ver. The roads are now in such i onditlon as to
prevent further hauling for the present."

Some New Things.
A new lead pencil has the lead small
enough to move freely inside the wood
and a small clutch near the sharp end to
move the lead forward to the opening in
the point, thus permitting new lead to be
inserted in it when desired.
A newly patented device for raising
sunken vessels consists of a caisson de
signed to be sunk and fastened to the ship,
after which air is pumped into the cais
son, forcing the water out and raising the
wreck by buoyancy of the air.
Tojliiht bicycle lamps by electricity a
new device has an armature run by a shaft
resting on the bicycle tire, thusgenerating
its own lig'>t. It is controlled by a gov
ernor so that the speed of the wheel does
not increase the light above a certain
point.
To prevent trains and trolley-cars from
minima; into a drawbridge opening a
Mic igan man has a device which auto
matically raises a section of the tn ck to
the right height to engage the wheel of
the car, thus preventing furthur progress.
A new bicycle ball-b?arinj; has two sets
of balls in each side of the hub, a rotating
ring being placed between them and act
ing as a cone and cup for the outer and
inner sets of balls respectively, the hub
and sbalt forming the remaining cones
and traps in the usual manner.
A new bicycle-propelling device has the
pedals placed in levers which engage the
usual sprocket wheel by clutches, the
downward motion of the pedal lever en
gaging the sprocket wheel and turning it
around a short distance, when the pedal
returns and the opposite one is forced
down.
Antomatic whistles for railroad loco
rooiives consist of a lever connected with
tne whistle, one end running down beside
the track to engage a series of blocks or
rails. As the locomotive approaches a
crossing the lever comes in contact with
these blocks, thus giving the desired
signal.
Streetcars can be ventilated by means of
a new device consisting of a rotary fan
run by the motion ot the car, placed in
the car roof and connecied with an ex
haust fan placed in tne end of a pipe run
ning to the interior of the car, the inten
tion being to exhaust the foul air in the
upper part of the car so that pure air can
e:iter from the outside.

Sunset Limited Crashes
Into the Berkeley-
Local.
THREE PERSONS BADLY
INJURED.
Fireman Walter Cornish Jumps
From the Cab and Is
Nearly Killed.
LADIES LEAP HEADLONG INTO
THE MUD.
The Force of the Collision Terrifi: '
and the Wonder Was That No
Lives Were Lost.
J OAKLAND, Cal . Jan. 19.â Through j
(he mistake of a signalman the Sunset i
Limited crashed into the rear of the Berke- '
ley local to-night and three people were .
badly hurt.
Several more were seriously shocked,
and that some were not killed is nothing
short of a miracle.
The Sunset train, with fourteen coaches,
ie!t the mole at 10:30 and was flying
toward tower 4, when the Berkeley local i
was seen to be standing on the main line.
There was not time to stop the Sun~et,
and although Engineer Carroll applied his
brakes as soon as he could it did not avert
the crash.
The powerful compound engine plowed !
into the rear coaoh of the Berkeley train,
whicb was awaiting the sitrnal. The force !
of the collision was terrific and the local
train was pushed ahead for fully the dis- .
tance of t. ree coach lengths.
The locomotive did not seem to feel the j
obstruction at first, but continued oa its j
way, cutting into the lear car of the local. I
Before t c Sunset train was stopped it
had completely demo ished the rear car
and the engine was crippled.
Ttie Berkeley car was fall of passengers, '
and when they saw that a collision was
inevitable they rushed in ali directions
for safety. Three Jadies ran out on the
rear platform qifod jumped into the mud.
There has been considerable dredging ;
done in the nei hborbood of the wreck
recently and the mud in the marsh is stiil i
slushy.
The ladies jumped into it an 1 refused
to be rescued a few minutes later, but al
though drenched with filth tliey saved
their lives by their action. Before they
had fairly struck the mud the Sunset de
molished lhe platform from which they
had just jumred.
Walter Cornish, the fireman on the San-
Mi train, is seriously injured. He saw
that a collision could not be averted and
[<efoTe the trains struck he jumped off the
cab.
Unfortunately for him, he jumped to
tbe left and landed on the heavy rocks
that form the embankment. He was seri
ously injured by the fall, and it is feared
he is hu. t internally.
Mr-. Lorenson, who lives at Seventeenth
ana Kirkbam streets, was unable to get
out of the car in time and was struck by
the wreck. She iB very seriously hurt m
terna.ly and cut about the body, and it is
feared she may die.
Tlie trainman of the rear of the Berke
ley train was waving a ted light just be
fore the collision, but it did not have the
i ffect of stopping the Sunset.
There was a panic in the Berkeley train,
W. B. GAY and MRS. MELLIE GAY and Her Daughter. The
Woman Claims to Be Gay's Third Wife.
and several ladies went into hysterics,
while many jumped off.
All of the Berkeley and main line trains
leave the pier upon one track and run
along Cedar street after leaving t: c mole.
Upon approaching Sixteenth-street sta
tion the Berkeley trains take a local track
fcbout 400 yards from the station. It was
at this point that the accident happened.
One hundred yards from the depot is
situated tower 4 from which all of the
switches are handled by means of com
pressed air. A signal post with sema
phores and signal lights is situated 200
yards soutn of this, nearer the mole. The
tower man is supposed to give the local
trains a clear signal and allow them to
run in upon the local track clear ol the
main line. For some unexplained reason
the B-rkeley local, consisting of engine
and three cars, was stopped at the sema
Â» phore.
The Sunset limited was only three
â  behind it and before tne former
fully stopped the latter was upon it.
Eneineer Carroll of the lim ted applied
his air brakes and reversed the engine,
but it was too late to save a collision.
Ihe rear car of the Berkeley train was
crashed all to pieces. The rear trucks
were thrown :o one side of the track and
the rear part of toe coach split into tooth
â¢ picks.
Glass was scattered throughout the car
and seats bent in all shapes. The signs in
the interior looked a3 if a cyclone had
struck them. The only wonder is that
aur one could have been inside and es
caped alive.
Engineer Carroll, who pulled out the
Sunset train, stayed at his post and did
not move from his cab till he had stopped
his train, although before he did so
pieces of the rear coach ot the local were
flying in all directions.
He was not hurt and after the wreck
was ihe coolest man in thÂ° crowd. He is
one of the oldest engineers in the service
of the company.
As soon as Mr. Wilder was notified he
orderea another engine to the scene, and
the Sunset was hauled back to tne pier.
Another engine wus attached and a little
after midnight the Minset limited was
palled out and started on its journey
Eastward.
It was ascertained that the name of the
tower man is Myers, and the officials at
the mole are inclined to <livide the blame
of the collision between him ana the
engineer ol the local.
JUDGE CAMPBELL'S CASE
The Grand Jury Think* the Inquiry a
"Waste of Time.
The Grand Jury spent all of its regular
session yesterday afternoon in inquiring
into the allegations concerning judue
Campbell and his habit of leaving "O.
R.," or "own recognizance," releases
anione his friends in the saloon business.
The inquiry was not completed, but it
is sate to say that Judge Campbell will be
exonerated frÂ» m b.'aine. F. B. O'Brien,
the one-time clerk of Judge Campbell's
court, who made the original charge, was
tue lirst witness. He aid not stick to his
story in any of its essential points. A
number of other witnesses were examined
and finally Judge Campbell himself was
summoned.
He was plied with questions not only
concernin â¢ he Gleason release transac
tion, but much more, looking to a general
reform in the trotem of appointments of
Pi>l:ce Court official -.
Foreman P lxotto said yesterday that
he did not believe the Judge meant to do
anything but wnat was rig t, and that, in
hi* opinion, he used good judgment iii the
Gleason case.

Never was a Republican convention con

than that which closed to-night.

segments, the syreestion contained in
Mr. Bodle's name, which was pronounced
"Boodle," the presence of the "Eighth
Ward ' and the assessingof them, all these
ami every other circumstance that could
be turned into a neat joke was used by
Chairman Talcott to enliven the proceed
ings.
The committee of platform and resolu
tions reported as follows and the report
was unanimously adopted:
Firstâ We profess a full and abiding faith in
the intelligence, fi ielity, prudence and patriot
ism of the Republican party as a political or
ganization.
Secondâ We strenuously urge the best pos
sible system of roads and drainage, of parks
and boulevards, and especially commend all
efforts looking toward me reclamation of the
West Oakland marsh, which has been so long,
an v isightly menace to hetlthand a serious
hindrance to the progress of our city. We
recognise the condition of our publio streets
as one of the main factors uffecting the growth
and ,-irosperity or tnis city, imd wÂ« indorse
the plan now being considered by the City
Council i t c'.assliying the same into main
thoroughfare*, business streets and residence
streets, and we recommend that our City
Council provide adequate means and facilities
for a systematic comae of repairs and main
tenance of ex stine improvements, and thut
ways and mea:is be immediately devised for
the reconstruction of our worn-out main
thoroughfares and business streets.
Thirdâ We are unanimously opposed to a
dismiisal or any compromise of the Oakland
waterfront suits now pending in the Supreme
Court of Calilornia and demand of each and
every t>erson whose name msv be presented to
this convention as a nominating body a defi
nite expression in connection with this resolu
tion. We earnestly iavor municipal control
of the water f ont and for that reason oppose
all legislation designed 10 piece its manage
ment in the hands 01 the State or of any com
mission appointed by the State.
Fourthâ We view with satisfaction the de
feat of the "Powers funding bt 11** in the House
of Representatives, and especially commend
our Representative, Hon. sj. G. Hilborn, for
his opposition thereto. We declare ourselves
unalterably opposed to any settlement of the
Pac.fic Railroad debts other than that pro
vided for by the present laws of the United
Slates.
Fifthâ We believe that all corporations
should be made to strictly conform to ail laws
and ordinances governing the city for the
benefit ot tne people, that they must keep out
of politics and net seek to control nartv nom
inations or the action of municipal officers to
the detriment of the people and tne puoiic
good, and we thereiore condemn all efforts on
the part of county officers or other person or
corporation to obtain, influence or control in
municipa 1 . offic s for their own ends.
Sixthâ W-e belieyv in the strict and rigid
regulation of the liquor traffic to the end that
the business may be confined as far as possible
to responsible pnrtiesand we pledge our nomi
nees for the Council to make strict investiga
tion of such permits In the residence portions
of the community and to summary closing
and removal of saloons in residence districts
where protests are tiled against them.
Stventhâ We believe that the present policy
of dividing the fire h\drants between the two
water companies is against public safety, and
we instruct our nominees for the Council, if
elected, to altcrnaie the fire hydrants between
the two (.'ompanie-t, that In the event 01 flre
the city may have the full benefit of the serv
ices of to<h companies, and wiil have the
service of one in the event of the disabling of
the other.
Eighhâ We believe in retaining all compe
tent >in<i honest public employes as a reward
for conscientious snrvice, and for that reason
we favor a discontinuance of annual elections
of public schoolteachers with a view of insur
ing them their positions during their effi
ciency and good behavior.
Lastlyâ We pledge our party and its nomi
nees to a generous policy of public improve
ments, carefully managed md conducted upon
business principles, that the people's money
shail not be squandered upon ill-conceived
enterprises badly supervised, and with none
to assume the responsibility.
The following resolution was then in
troduced and read by G. D. Gray:
The Republican party believes that the
right of majorities to rule is unquestioned,
aiid io thin end it pledges its nominees for
Mayor and Council in event of their election,
and in case a majority of the electors of this
city voting on the question express them
selves at the coming municipal election aa
favorable to closing on Sundays places where
spirituous or malt liquors or fermented wines
ore now sold, to immediately put in force an
ordinance to that effect.
A tribute to Colonel E. D. Baker was
adopted by a rising vote indorsing the bill
introduced in the Legislature of Califor
nia at its present vesaion by Hon. James
A. Waymire in the House and by Hon. F.
8. 8 i rat ton in the Senate to appropriate

thusiasm shown.
For the office of Treasurer N. S. Donglas,
Z. T. Gilpin and George Chase were nomi
nated and the vote showed Gilpin 92,

Mr. Douglas caused a chea/ to rise by
going on the platform with an American

There was no contest over the nomina

As 74 votes were necessary to a choice

EXPENSES AT A GLANCE.
Auditor Snow Adopts a Com
prehensive Method of Mak
ing Oit Reports.
Sluients of Municipal Government
Would Like to Sse It Used
in Every C ty.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 19. f
Auditor Snow has adopted the plan
formulated by Professor F. R. Clow, an
Eastern profess r, in making out his
most recent municipal report. It is the
most comprehensive method yet prac
ticed, and shows more at one glance than
it is usual to fina in municipal reports
after several hours' study.
Instead of a multitude of small ac
count?, Mr. Snow has divided the city's
expenditures into soven heads. They are
as follows: Maintenance of the city pov
ernment, public safety, public conven
ience, care of certain classes, higher ob
jects, quasi-private undertakings, payment
of bonded debt and interest.
"It is the purpose of this report," said Mr.
Snow, "to set forth in the simplest man
ner the income of the city ami the cost of
every department for the last lifty years.
Few complexities will be found, salaries,
repairs and new construction appearing in
the department to which they beiong, and
clearness has not in any case been sacri
ficed for administrative or any other
reason.
"The hope has been expressed by stu
dents of municipal finance that the form
of report by the city of Oakland bine c
1889 will be adopted by ail the cities oi the
United States, and also that a summary of
the expenditures be added for the purpose
of comparison. The plan of this sum
mary has been the subject of considerable
study, and I have concluded to follow in
part Wagner of Germany and Professor
Frederick R. Clow of the United States."
A recapitulation of the city's expenses
under the heads already mentioned gives
the following figures, the "extraor
dinary"' column indicating amounts not
needed for the ordinary conduct of the
variout departments :

HE KEPT WATCH
IN A TREETOP
Peculiar Behavior of an
Agent of a Patent Fish
plate Company.
Employed Watchmen to Protect
the Track, but Forgot to
Pay Them.
To.d Rtmarkab c Ta'es About Rivjis
Who Were Attempting to
Ruin Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 19. f
A. TomDfeins, who claims to be the pro
moier of a patent for laving streetcar
track*, has been operating in Fruitvale,
and a number oi men who have been
working for htm would like to know his
present location.
The promoter made use of business cards
which stated that he was the sole Califor
nia agent for the Wooley patent fishplate
and bolt an<l obtained permission from tbe
Hay wards Electric Railroad to place some
of his bolts on a section of their road at
Fruhvale.
After putting the bolts and plates in po
sition Tompkins hired half a dozen men,
half of whom watch by day and the other
half by night. They were told that there
was a conspiracy on foot to injure these
plates in such a manner as to make them
appear of no vaiue. Each watchman was
secretly instructed to keep watch on his
neighbor, and was given to understand
that his fellow- watchers had been bought
to stand in with a rival company and
work an injury to the Tompkins patent.
At all hours of the night Tompkins
wouid disguise himself and go down to
the tracks for the puopose of seeing
whether his men were on duty. On sev
eral occasions bis men were so conscien
tious that Tompkins, who had started to
meddle with the fishplates, was quite
roughly handled before his watchmen
were convinced of his identity.
On an another occasion Tompkins went
down at night to see if his men were faith
ful, and he climbed up into a tree from
wnere he could watch. While up the tree
he fell usleep and tumbled to the ground,
and some of his watchmen picked him up.
After this Kind of business had been
kept up for a week the men wanted their
pay. and at this juncture Mr. Tom [kins
seems to have taken a trip to some other
city, for he cannot be lound, although
Deputy Constable Robinson has visited all
the places where Tompkins would be
likely to be.
A. L. Stone, secretary of the Haywards
road, said to-day that their superintend
ent, Gustafsou, had given Tomkins per
mission to lay some fishplates as an
cxi eriment on tneir track at Fruitvale.
Nothing was paid him for his trouble, and
the company did not bind itself to do any
business with Tompkins.
On account of his connection with a
firm which was important enough to make
experiments and pay for a small crowd of
watchmen, Thompkins' credit was very
good, ami accor. line to Constable Robin
son he appr ciated his standing and took
advantage of it. He has not yet turned
up, and those watchmen go down at night
to watch tnose plates no more. They are
now diligently watching for Tompkins'
return.
DUREELL A WITNESS.
He Is Asked to Tell Whether Unda'a
Saloon Was Kept Open
Too Late.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 19.â Marshal
Lloyd's campaign against Saloon-keeper
Unda of West Berkeley developed a new
and startling sensation to-day, when it
was found that Lloya had summoned as a
witness in the case G. G. Durrell, Trustee
of Ward 5.
The Marshal is endeavoring to prove
that Unda committed perjury in swearing
that his saloon was never kept open after
midnight. Berkeley has an ordinance
prohibiting such establishments from
doing business after that hour. It is said
that Durrell was one of the alter-midnignt
customers of Unda, and he was called by
Lloyd to tell what he knows about the
nours kept by the saloon man.
Durrell is one of the Trustees who
framed the ordinance regulating liquor
establishments. He has represented the
Fifth Ward of West Berkeley since ;he
last election.
The Vaccination Fight.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Jan. 19.â Health
Officer Rowell and School Director Norton
have foug t out their battle over tne
matter of vaccination and, after mutual
withdrawals of statements attributed to
them, peace reigns.
The Health Officer addressed a letter to
the Board of Education, in which he ex
pressed his opinion of the Lorin member
in no uncertain words. He said :
"It is apparent that a statement of this
s-ort, coming from an opponent of vac
cination, is offered in little short of a
malicious and contemptible spin;, and is
characteristic of that class of carping ob
structionists who view life from a 15-cent
standpoint ana place at defiance laws
passed by the State and regarded by many
people of common sense as beneficial."
Mr. Norton told of reports that had
come to his ears which he thought justi
fied his assertions.
The board again decided that it had no
option but to enforce vaccination, and all
pupils in the public schools will have to
take the smallpox prevention, except such
aB are likely to be injured thereby.
New School I>irector.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan, 19.â The resig
nation of George A. Norton, School Direc
tor ot the Fiftn Ward, has been accepted
by the board of Education. J. S. Crew,
whom Mr. Norton recommended for the
place, was chosen to fill the vacancy.

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
â¢man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, - but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. . Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam not a philanthropist, ' nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mall the information, but send for it ana
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time of happiness to most or us. Write to

"SKEETS" MARTIN
WON THE RACE
The Local Boy Rode a
Pretty Race Astride
Ferrier.
Fly Saved the Day for the
Favorites by Taking the
Last Event
Duke of York 11, a Brother to Carmel ]
ani True Blue, Outfcoted His
Company.
To use an expression often beard in the
"pumpkin country" "Skeets" Martin is
getting to be a "right pert young feller"
in the saddle. He sat astride of the big
chestnut horse Ferrier in the seven-fur
long event run at Emeryville track yes
terday and the most exacting critic could
hardly nave picked a flaw in the ride he â 
finished. To be sure he had much the
best of the weights over the 3to 2 choice
Preston, bat this detracts not the least
from the clever manner with which he
handled his moust Salisbury 11, the
outsider in the betting among the five
starters, piloted by Thorpe, cut out a
merry clip to the stretch witn Preston at
his heels and Ferrier at the latter's side.
Once straightened for the wire "Skeets"
Martin let oat a wrap on Ferrier and the
big horse took command. Willie Martin,
on the favorite, rode the brown horse
hard, but the difference was too wide and I
Walter Hobart's chestnut won handily by
a length in 1:27. Hard ridden by Doggett,
Installator was a good third.
The winner was as good as 16 to 5 in the
betting at post time.
The cruel, bamh trade winds that blow
in through the beautiful Golden Gate,
sweeping Emeryville and its environs, had |
their usual rancorous effects on the favor- i
ites. Fly, a 1 to 2 chance in tne closing j
race with no chance of losing except by j
falling dead on the course, won. The j
other choices of the talent perished mis
srably.
Monitor, the 9 to 5 choice among the
thirteen starters in the opening six-fur- j
long scramole, flattered his backers by j
leading to the stretch, when he began to j
tire. Banjo, a2sto 1 shot, tben looked a !
winner to within forty yards of the finish \
wliere he was passed and beaten out by ;
Purser's Abalanzar, apainst which 12 to 1 1
was obtainable around post time.
The three-furlong dash saw nine babies
from the Kindergarten take a lesson in rac
ing. A hot tip made Blitz, the Burns &
Watei-house entry, an 8 to 5 favorite, but
he never got near tbe front. Duke of
York 11, with 15 to 1 against him in the
ring, was iir3t all the way, leading out
Boadicea by a couple of length? at the
tape in 36J-j' seconds. Count of Flanders
wa? a lair third, in front of Ezell's On Gua
Nita.
? [Bookmaker John Humphreys' gelding
itt:e Cripple was dished up as the proper
thing lor the mile aDd a lurlong selling
event. He was backed from threes to 13 to
5, but ran as tbougli staie, never cutting
much of a figure. In a drive Slaughter
got Doyle, the second choice, past the
judges half a length ahead of Scimitar in
1:55, a very fair performance. Hermanita
v>a~- third, a head away.
Fiy had nothing to beat in the conclud
ing six-furlong spin and spread-eagled the
crowd opposed to him, winning under a
pull in 1:14%. Woodchopper was second,
half a lengtu before Blue Bell.
>"OTISS.
'"Curley" Shields, owner of Scimitar,
was questioned by the judges at the con
clusion of the third race regarding the
improved sjiowing made by the brown
horae over his last public appearance.
Mr. Shields stated that in the race pre
ceding the one of yesterday Scimitar
twisted one of his plates, which explana
tion was quite satisfactory.
Louis Ezell was also questioned regard
ing the poor showing made by Unity.
The horse had a hard race on Monday,
and as Mr. Ezell produced tickets showing
that he had backed his horse with Cook &
Co. and the Richmond Club he was exon
erated from any wrongdoing.

make a mild "killing."
Duke of York 11, winner of the two
year-old event, is a handsome chestnut
and full brother to the erratic Carmel and
the good perlormer, as a two-year-old,
True Biu*. He was bred by P. J. Dona
hue at Laurelwood stock farm, Santa
Clara County, and that gentleman was
quite elated over the younsster's victory.
Me bids fair to eclipse both of his brothers
in creating a shining turf mark.

named Golden Echo by Owner Jack Fol

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1897.
DID THE BOARD
ACT UNLAWFULLY?
Mr. Babcock Thinks That
the Old School Direc
tors Erred.
Finds a Decision Under Which
Their Acts May Have Been
Invalid.
Mr. Murdock Sat as a Member After
. Hs Resigned, Although He Had
Not Been Reinstated.
Superintendent Babcock of the public
schools has discovered a decision of the
Supreme Court which he believes to be
applicable to the resignation of School
Director MurdocK last October, and, if his
conclusions are correct, there may ba
some question raised concerning the legal
ity of all the proceedings of the board be
tween October and the first of January.
At least this is the view taken of it by Mr.
Babcock. He has submitted the matter
to the City and County Attorney for con
sideration.
"The decision which I have found," said
Superintendent Babcock yesterday, "is
that of the People against Porter, which
was given by the Supreme Court of this
State. It appears to me to be applicable,
and I understand that there :s a later deci
sion in the same direction. The doctrine
laid down in tbe Porter case is that the
appointing power has nothing to do with
a resignation, and that when an incum
bent of a civil office resigns that resigna
tion takes the person out of office."
The decision which Mr. Babcocs re
ferred to is found in 6 Cal., 26. The ac
tion was for the usurpation by the defend
ant, Porter, of tne office of County Judge
of Calaveras County. There was a va
cancy in the office of County Judge on the
Ist of September. On the 13th day of Au
gust William H. Baageley, County Judge
of Calaveras County, tendered to the Gov
ernor bj mail his resignation, which was
to take effect September 1. The resigna
tion was received* by tne Governor August
24. No action was taken by him until
September 8, when he appointed and com
missioned Porter, who entered at once
upon the discharge of his duties.
In the meantime the bupervisors had or
dered an election to take piace September
5 to ri!l the vacancy, ana Charles A. Leake
was duly elected, obtained his certificate
of election from the County CierK, quali
fied and offered to enter into office, but
was prevented by Porter irom so v. ing.
In the or in ion of Justice Terry, Justice
Heyienfeldt concurring, it was set forth
that "the tenure of an office does noi de
pend upon the will oi the executive, but
of tlio incumoent. I have no doubt that
it wa-* in his (Baciceley's) power at any
time before September 1 to withdraw his
resignation and continue in office. No:
having done so the resignation became
effectual and a vacancy was created on
that day. ''The judgment of the lower
court, which was in lavor of Porter, was
confirmed.
The facts concerning the resignation of
School Director Murdock were as follows:
He resigned his cilice October '2, 1896, say
ing that he was not, satisfied. Upon mo
tion oi Director McElroy the resignation
was laid upon the table. October 14 the
board received a letter from Air. Murdack,
in which he explained his absence and
sa>d that the matter was in the hands of
the City and County Attorney.
A.t the same meeting Director McElroy
moved that permission be given to Mr.
Murdock to withdraw his resignation.
Director Carew moved lo await the action
of the City and County Attorney, and this
motion was adopted. Mr. Muraock then
resumed the performance of the duties of
a member of the ooard and so continued
until the terms of oilice of the boar*! had
all expired, his status not being affected
by any opinion of the City ana County
Attorney. Mr. Murduck'snamo is found
set down on the rtcor>.;s in response to the
rollcall on October 28.
From that time on he took part in the
deliberations or the board and voted on
propositions contemplating the expendi
ture oi money and other matters of public
importance.
Now Mr. Babcock contends that Mr.
Murdock having resigned, in view of the
doctrine laid down in People vs. Porter
by the Supreme Court, he was no longer a
member of the board and that the board,
by permitting him to sit as a member,
and to vote as a member, alter he had
resigned, may h;ive invalidated ali that it
did during the latter part of the year.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Two Benefit Meets Friday and Saturday
of This Weekâ Bicycle JÂ»g
gage Bill.
The Garden City Cyclers have a good
entry-list for their beneht meet to be held
Friday of this week at San Jose. The
names are now in the hands of Official
Handicapper Smyth, who will complete
bia work to-day. All the professionals
and many of the amateurs of this City and
across the bay will compete.
Regarding the League of American
Wheelmen's meet, which had to be post
poned from last Saturday to next Satur
day, the 23d, owing to rain, there is noth
ing to be done but wait for the day to
come and pray it will be fair. The racers
are a.l doing some indoor work to keep in
condition, and the week's extension of
time will give those who were a trifle off
in condition a chance to set into proper
shape. Seats sold for last Saturday need
not be exchanged. The advance sale was
the largest of any meet yet given at the
Velodrome, and the management felt it
would put many people to unnecessary
trouble to ask them to exchange their
ticketi. The management is in hopes
that Ziegler will race at this meet, as he
is now in excellent shape, and also expect
Downing, Stevens and McFarland.
Becker, the five-mile champion, will also
have returned Irom the north and will
nde. Loughead, Hie Canadian, is not in
form. With the addition of Ziegler and
the others to the already well-lilled pro
fessional lists, it will be a great day's sport.
thief Consul Kerrigan has called a
meeting- of the board of officers of the
North California Division, League of
American Wheelmen, to be heid next
Monday evening, the 25th, at 441 Golden
Gaie avenue. Final arrangements regard
ing the sending of delegates to the
National assembly of thejeague will then
be made. The ruemDership committee oj
the league, accompanied by the chief
consul, visited the Golden Gate Cycling
Club last evening and secured a number
of new members.
Charles Albert Adams and Percy V.
Long have gone to Sacramento in the in
terests of the bicycle baggage bill, which
was introduced by Assemblyman North of
Alameda on January 11 and will come up
before the Judiciary Committee to-day.
The Imperial Cycling Club held its
fourth party last evening at Native Sons'
Hail ana^ it proved very enjoyable,
eclipsing all previous efforts of the club
in this direction.
The East Oakland Wheelmen entertain
ment takes place Friday evening of this
week at Washington Hall, East Oakland.
A meeting will be held at the California
Hotel to-morrow evening, at which the
representatives of the organized whe^l.
men will discuss the part they are to take
in the bin carnival next April.
MRS. MORELOCK ACCUSED.
Her Management of MrÂ». McGarrity' s
Estate Is Seriously Called
in Question.
Judge Coffee has issued a citation com
manding Mrs. Mary Morelock to make an
accounting of her management of the
estate of Mr 3. Margaret McGarrity, an
inmate of an insane asylum.
Serious charges are made against Mrs.
iClorelock by K. Bcrren, who presented
the matter to the court. He avers that
Mrs. Morelock got Mrs. McGarrity drunk
and kept her so until appointed guardian
of the un.'ortunate woman's person and
estate; that subsequently Mr*. McGarrity
was railroaded to an insane t.syluin, and
that her guardian, who has charge of
$4500 worth of property, is coliecting rent
and not making a proper accounting lor
the same.
Mr. Borren says that Mrs. Moreloc,* is
an iuveterate stock gambler, an illiterate
and dishonest person, and incompetent to
manage her ward's affairs.

SOME DEFECTIVE PRINTING
AS A FAIR CASE BOGIE MAN
A Blurred "0" in a Legal Blank Is the Keynote tc
the Charges Against Notary
Cooney.
OPENING OF THE CASE
IN COURT.
The Heirs of the Millionaire
Spring Their Promised
Sensation.
A STATIONERY CLEBK TELLS
HIS STORY.
Legal Blanks Printed by H. S. Crocker
& C\ ?s Evidence in the
Famojs Suit.
A defective imprassion of the letter "o" j
in the certificate of acknowledgmenton the
famous pencil deeds and some twenty-five
microscopic evidences of a battered or
faulty impression in the printing of the j
documents is the mainspring in the trap
by which the Fair children would convict !
ex-Notary James J. Cooney of perjury.
A batch of 5000 of these invisible defects \
passed through the presses of H. S. |
Crocker <fc Co. a year ago. Captain Lees ;
and ttie bonanza representative's detec- j
tives say these same evidences o.f poor !
printing are visible in the forms Cooney j
used to certify to the maKiug of the Craven
deeds by James G. Fair.
The millions of the dead man began the '
work of springing this trap yesterday, i
By way of beginning they put W. E !
Stanford, clerk ol the legal blank depart- j
ment, on the stand lo recall that he at
tended to the printing of 10,000 copies of
the notarial certilicates on January 8,
1896. To-day the foreman and stereotyper i
will be called to testify that in one-half of
the lot, in the haste attending the work, a I
defective matrix was used. The pro- i
crammt then cajls for a desperate effort
to convince the public that under the ,
microscor>e there are similardefects in the I
blanks Cooney used.
Stanford Wit* confident he had given an ,
order for the printing of what is known '
in stationery as form 132. lie brought a j
record along in the way of a ledger to I
prove his statements at the request of j
Captain Lees. Unuer cross-examination !
he got rather mixed in his answers. He j
was glad an'i so seemed the lawyers for j
the estate when ho was relieved from two
hours on the broiler under the curiosity of
Cooney 'a attorneys.
The case marked the opening of what is
practically the struggle, between Mrs. 'â 
Craven and the Fair estate, and of course j
it was a drawing card.
The day began eventfully. The pressure
for admittance to the courtroom was I
reminiscent of tho Durrant case. The !
opposing forces were lined up in front of ;
Justice of the Peace Cook, for sometimes i
in the history of Fair matters a judge has
performed the anomaly of an immed ; a:e j
transformation from one sort cf official !
dignity to another. So it was as maais- !
tiate that Carroll Cook heard the opening
Of the evidence. If ne rinds Cooney gu ltv
of perjury, why the case will then be heard
before Judge Cook. i
Tue throng that filed the courtroom :
was ruotley and morbidly curious. It j
wriggled its neck a thousand times in an- I
ticipation of somethin.: in the way of a
climax. Only once was its hopes realized, j
That was when SteDhen Roberts pulled
from his pockets the famous pencil deeds, j
Then there was a wrenching of necks that
made work for the bailiffs. The public
wanted to see the deeds. They are valua
ble pap^r.-, and Roberts, since they have j
been on repeated exhibition by attorneys, I
photographers and newspaper reporters, |
did not feel like letting them co on a pro- '
miscaous tour among The spectators.
Evan when he gave them to Barnes for !
inspection at the advice of Attorney i
Reidy, he kept his eyes sharply on the I
big throng in the rear. In* this con- I
te-tforthe bonanza millions mutual d is- j
trust and suspicion have grown among the I
contending interests. The trust will of
the dead millionaire was stolen from the
Recorder's office almost as soon as it was
nled. The Craven people are naturally j
NEW TO-DAY.

enough guarding against such a fate for
the deeds, for the Fair people nave cov
eted their possession ever since the cele
brated lawsuit began.
There was an army of lawyers present.
Captain Lees, District Attorney Barnes
and detectives were conspicuous person
alities in the ranks of the estate. Reuben
Lloyd and George A. Knight, represent
ing the children of the dead millionaire,
and W. R. Goodfellow, fighting for the
rights of the trust will against the
heirs, made common cause with the prose
cution.
Across the room was Cooney sitting by
his attorney, Patrick W. Reddy. His
father was in the rear. Mrs. Craven, con
lined to her borne iince her recent visit to
Sacramento with a slight illness, was
present by proxy in the persons of Attor
neys W. W. Foote and ex-Judge Denson.
There were others, but there name is le
gion.
It took a long time for the District At
torney to get the real show going. The
preliminaries consisted of spirited
wrangling among the lawyers. Reddy
and Barnes paid an almost continuous
string of compliments to each other in
the way of vigorous 'objecting." When
there was a hiatus in the uproar Foote
toot an opportunity to emphasize some
point.
Barnes exhausted the entire morning in
getting Cooney's depositions, upon which
the charge of perjury was based, officially
tefore Magistrate Cook. The.y lay on a
table in front of the eyes of all â volumin
ous heaps of books and papers â but they
conid not be seen legally by the court
until they had been properly introduced,
as attorneys say.
Deputy County Clerk Piper was first
called as a witness to toll the court that
the papers had been filed in his ollice.
An hour was consumed in reading the
cnntentsof the documents. Then Captain
Lees unbosomed himself of some heavy
cardboard packages, a batch of photo- j
graphic copies of the pencil deeds. These i
the Dutrict Attorney proceeded next to |
get introduced to the court.
Stephen Roberts was the instrument
usfid to bring about this result. Roberts
had the original deeds in his pocketâ he
said so â and Barnes wanted to impress
the court with the fact that the card
board copies were genuine fac-sirniles. To
do this it was first necessary to get Rob
erts to make the comparison.
Barnes suggested that the mining broker I
produce the documents for public inspec- i
lion. Foote was on the poll of the prose
cution with a vigorous knock. As attor
ney for Mrs. Craven, lie did not see why
ht^r papers, representing big pieces of
City property in a civil suit, should be
broils.' l !! into the case intended merely as
a criminal prosecut.on.
Barnes argued that Cooney's signature
was on the deed, and that signature was
in reality the whole fabric of the perjury
charge against the young notary. Foote
remonstrated. He saw those papers going
into the court possession as exhibits or
something else, and they were too valu
able to entrust to even anybody just now
in view that their validity was to be
tested in a civil court in a few days.
"We won't have them impounded in
anybody's possession," said the attorney.
"There have been so many intimations
that Mrs. Craven never will produce them
in the trial of her clnims that somebody
might eudeavor to effect their disappear
ance." He threw an insinuatine glance
to the Fair side of tue house, and the air
began to sizzle when Magistrate Cook said
he would not take possession of them if nn
could avoid it.
r "I might lock them up in a sale-deposit
vault â " Foote shook his head, and it j
was finally agreed that Roberts should
keep the papers him?elf, he agreeing to
have them in court whenever necessary.
The work of effecting the comparison
then proceeded without opposition. Then
Judgs Slack was called to certify mat
Cooney had really sworn to the deposi
tion before him, and the Fair people, Po
lice Department and District Attorney
proceeded to open their ca>'e by narrating
the history or the way the legal blank de
partment of H. S. Crocker is conducted.
Stanford told the attorney be lived at
632 Hayes street, and had been in prac
tical charge of the Crocker legal blank
business for a number of years. He is
young, curly-haired, blue-eyed and an un
easy witness. He began his story by say
ing that on January 8, 1896. he had or
dered printed 10.000 copies of "blank 182."
which is the certificate notary publics U3e
to add to their acknowledgment to deeds
and such like.
Usually be ordered these printed in
batches of 5003, but as this was a hurried
order he had marked the word "rus â ." on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1897.
the copy as it went upstairs to the prin
ters. The printers did their work with
rather too much rush, as the letter "o" in
the word "of" of the phrase "State of
California" was defective. Stanford pro
duced his ledger to verify the date of the
order, also the original copy that went
flyine up the tube to the printing presses,
and was turned over to the mercy of
Reddy for cros%exarmnation.
He did not know exactly how long this
particular brand of blank h&d been in the
stock ot the firm, but for a long time.
"When were you first approached about
this matter by anyDody?"
''About two weeks ago," was the reply.
JUDGE COOK Sitting as Magistrate in the Preliminary Examination of Ex-Notary Cooney,
"By whom?" asked Reldy, curiously.
The reply was that Attorney W. M.
Pierson, one of the executors of the trust
will, was his visitor on that mission at
that time in company with Manager For
syth of tiie house.
"How long have yon been keeping a
record of this business," queried Keddy,
beginning to critically examine the ledger
Stanford had produced for the inspection
of the attorney. The stationery clerk said
that he had been with his job since 1892.
The record of the printing of "b.ank
132" since John H. Dickinson drafted it
for the Crocker people some years ago
showed that it was customary to order it
in lots of 5000. Only on January 8. 18!>6,
had the order been "doubled. Stanford
said the extra batch was called for in
haste because there was not a solitary
notarial certificate in the house at the
time.
"Not a single one but this?" asked
Redtiy, holding u,p the slip of p:iper.
"Not one other," was the reply.
Wnen Pierson called on his detective
mission Stanford gave him all that was j
in the house with the defectiva ll O."
"How did it come that only half this lot
of 10,000 were so marked?"
"They were printed iv two lots of 5000
each."
"Who told you to come here to-day?"
"I was subpenaed."
"Yes, Dut who toid you to bring this
book here?' 1
â Mr. Crocker, I think."
"Haven 1 1 you some other records similar
to thU?"
"Yes."
"Well, why didn't you bring them
along?"
"Well, I think they are in Crocker's j
possession."
Stanford was again asked to relate the
incidents of Pierson's visit. The Jawyer ]
was introduced to him by his manager. |
and a few minutes Inter Captain Lees |
arrived. He got out his magniiying glass.
I The party iratheretl all the old stock of
i this particular issue of blanks together
| and took them away.
"D.d any body instruct you to let nobody
look through your records or examine
any of tl^e blanks?"
"About rive days ago I received in
structions to refer al 1 inquirers to Mr.
! Crocker. 1 '
"Did Captain Lees give you such in-
I structions?"
"No."
Reddy took up the ledger again and
scrutinized the entries made by Stanford.
They we/c generally in pencil. Under the
entry for the 10,000 order there was a
peculiar blue pencil mark.
"Who put that there?"
"1 don't know."
"D,d you ever see it before?"
"No," replied Stanford, after a pause.
Redoy found that the leaf of the book
bore evidences of having been rubbed and
rouehened directly under the word
"10,000." He put Stanford through an
j other course of sprouts. First the station
ery clerk admitted there were evidences
of erasion, bnt through the magnifying
glass t c paper saenied in its proper con
dition to his eye.
Barnes took him in hand once more to
pet the statement irom him, at Attorney
Knight's hurried apDeal, that he had
written the order, and the writing as it
appeared was his.
To-day Superintendent Wade of the
printing department and H. S. Crocker
Â«i!l be the principal witnesses to give the
details of the defective printing.
THOSE CALDWELL LETTERS
Young Fair Has a Poor Memory for
Details.
Young Fair was not in attendance in
court, but instead was explaining, with
the assistance of his attorney, Charles J.
Hejrgerty, betore a notary public, why he
had failed to return a number of letters to
Jerome Caldweli of Los Angeles.
The letters were written by the elder
Fair to Caldweli, and refer to a variety of
events Their chief bearing on the pres
ent case is that nobody denies their genu
ineness regarding the handwriting.
They fell into Fair's hands during the
progress of the pencil will contest, and he
refused to return them. Caldweli was
compelled to sue for their possesion.
Fair claimed he had paid Caldweli $100
fur them throueh C. J. Stilwell, the de
tective. Attorney D. M. Delmas had the
young millionaire on the rack.
Fair was asked by what right he claimed
the letters. This he would not answer.
"Did you purchase them from Cald
weli?"
'â¢Well, I understood so."
"What did you pay for them?"
"One hundred dollars. 1 paid the money
to C. J. Stilwell."
Deimas inquired :f he had a receipt
from Caldweli lor his money. Fair re
plied in the negative. He llad a letter
from Caldweli on the subject, but could
noi remember where it was.
"Are you quite sure of that?"
"Oh, yes."
â¢'Relating to these letters in contro
vert V?"
"Yes.'
"And will you produce them?"
"Yes; as soon as I find them."
Then Delmas jroi off on the payment of
the $100 to Stilwell. He wanted to know
if a bill had been presented by the detec
tive. Fair replied in the affirmative, say
ing he had the receipted bill at home.
"Will you produce it?" inquired DeJ
maÃ. curiously. But Fair's attorneys
would allow no reply. The notary was re
quested to issue the usual subpena calling
lor the bill and the attorney continued to
probe after mere details. He wanted a
distinct affirmative in the matter of that
$50â Was it paid for the letters?â but Fair
shifted and equivocated.
"What is the date of the Stilwell re
ceipt?"
"I don't know."
Fair, continuing, said that Stilwell told
him he had paid $50 to Caldwell with a
promise of a similar sum.
"Did Stilwell say he had paid that $50
to Caldwell on account of these letters?' 1
"I understand it was such."
"Did Stilwell tell you that?"
"1 think he dm."
"Does the bill say so?"
But again the young millionaire took
refuge under his attorney's wing.
Delmas came back by inquiring the date
of Stilwell's bill. Fair promised to look
tnat detail up.
Then the attorney desired to know if
Fair had any evidence in the way of a hill
of sale of the letters from Caldwell, Fair
could not answer until he had made a de
tailed >earch of hi 3 effects.
It was fast becoming uncomfortable for
Fair. Delmas asked him if the $50 paid
Caldwell was not as compensation for as
sistin â  the detectives in obtaining in
formation of the dead millionaire's doings
and habits in Southern California. Heg
gerty promptly forbid his client, and an
adjournment for a couple of days was
taken.
TURNED ON THE GAS.
Charles Peterson, an Old Soldier, At-
tempts to Commit Suicide.
Charles Peterson, an old soldier, at
tempted to commit suicide in his room,
405 Kearny street, last night by gas.
The proprietor, A. Combatalade, found
him sitting unconscious on a chair with
a tube in his mouth, the tube being at
tached to the gas jet, which was turned on.
Combitalade summoned Policeman J. C.
Hall, who in turn notified the Coroner's
office. Strange to say, neither the pro-

prictor nor the policeman turned off the
gas or took the tube out of Peterson's
mouth, as they thought he was dead, and
it was not till the Coroner's deputies,
J. L. McCormick and J. E. O'Brien, ar
rived that this was attended to. It was
then seen that the man was alive.
He was carried into another room and
the Coroner's deputies set to work to re
susci.ate him. A few minutes of artificial
respiration servea the purpose and Peter
son revived sufficiently to be sent to the
Receiving Hospital. "He will probably
recover.
Special Sale Days.
L. Lebenbaum & Co., the well-known
Sutter-street grocery firm, has inaugurated
a day for special sales, and hereafter on
Tuesday of each week there will be some
special line of articles offered by this big
establishment that will, no doubt, eclipse
anything in the way of special sales here
to Tore offered in the grocery business in
San Francisco.
L. Lebenbaum & Co. carry one of the
largest and most varied lines of groceries
on this coast, and the reputation of the
firm for their high class of groceries is too
well and favorably known to require
commendation.
It will be the object of this establishment
to offer some special line of goods at cost
price on Tuesdays, and the advertising
colums of the daily journals will no
doubt be scanned by careful housewives
each Monday for the special bargains of
the big grocery- house of L. Lebenbaum &
Co., 326 Butter street.

John Matthew Voorbamme, aged 61 years,

venter.

Trouble was experienced in obtaining a
burial permit owing to a rumor that j
death resulted indirectly from a criminal |
operation performed by the unfortunate
woman. â¢
Mrs. Dr. ParK and Mrs. Dr. Morrison,
who knew the woman's condition, were
inclined to believe that death resulted
from dilation of the heart, but the I
Coroner was told that she had carried out
her oft-repeated threat to perform the
operation.
"As the cortege had already started to
Masonic Cemetery," said the Coroner, '"i
allowed a pro ;oriua funeral, but forbade !
the interment of the body or placing it in
a vault. The procession went to the ceme
tery and the uody was returned for an
autopsy."
The circumstances attending the
woman's aeath will be investigated to
day. . _
