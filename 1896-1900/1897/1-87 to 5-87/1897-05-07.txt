HAVANA, Cuba, May 6. -Insurgents
are very active around Guanabacoa, six
miles from Havana across the bay. About
1500 are now encamped within si:rht of
Guanabacoa. Co'or.el Fondeviella at
tempted yesterday to dislodge them, bu
was repulsed and had to re-enter the
town. He retired so hurriedly that the
troops left sixteen dead soldiers on the
road whom the Cubans buried.
General Quintin Banderos, after attack
ing Artemisa and other towns, led an as
sault Sunday on Caadelaria, sacking many
stores and securing a large Btippiy of arms,
ammunition and money. Later he met
the bands of Baldomers, Acosta and Gen
eral Adolfo Castillo. Thus re-enforced be
Ijroceedeu west. Banderos' marcli from
the eastern part of Santiago de Cuba to
the western province of P.nar del Rio has
been a great military achievement only
comparable to Gomez and Maceo's
marches last year.
Banderos passed Jucaro-Moron trocha
la;e in March near the southern line,
routing General Arola's columns, whicii
that military line. Though the
inct was denied it had to be officially rec
ognized a few days later by the writer,
when in an engagement on the Santa
Ciara side of the trooha Banderos thor
oughly defeated the Spanish columns of
Uusco and Ruiz. The Cuban general
joined Gomez at the estate La Refornin in
Santa Clara province and after receiving
instructions continued his. successful
march west.
Since his arrival he has fought the Span
iards al;no3t every day. He passed near
the town of Sancti Spiritus, challenging
Weyjer to battle. The latter sent the col
umn of General Segura against nim.,
After t\so uayÂ»' righting the Spaniards re
tired to S-incti Spiritus. At Si^uauca
Mountain* Banderos adaed to his forces
803 men of General Alemrui's armj', who
vi-hed to go with liim to Pinar del Rio.
In a number of lights he cleared the
ru untaia district of Spanish, and making
.1 rapid advance enterpd Matanzas pro

One of the wonderful facts of this march
- the short time it took. Banderos la the
only negro ol high rank in the Cuban
army. Two weeks ago he was reported to

NEW ORLEANS, La., May 6â News
from Honduras is that Dr. Enrique de
Soto has finally been proclaimed presi
dent by the revolutionists. The com
ruander-in-chief of the rebels is General
Lopez, ex-commander ana ex-Governor of
the Department of Intubaca. Tho second
in command is General John Drummond,
well known in New Orleans. Oi her offi
cers of the revolution are General Herbert
Jpffers, an ex-New York cavalryman;
General Alfonso Gilhardo, who figured m
the revolution that established General
Gutierrez in Salvador and General Ra

Drummond has been placing in con
venient position arms and ammunition
for the past year. It is belio?ed large
quantities of arms and ammunition were
stored in convenient points in Honduras
and Balize. President Belaya of Nica
ragua, to whose assistance Bonilla of
Honduras largely owes the Presidency,
has finally decided to help Bonilla in the
ri^ht against the revolutionists, and the
Nicaragtian gunboat Lucy B, commanded
by General Pablo Raynes, has left Blue
fields for Puerto Cortez to try to capture
the latter place. The troops on the Lucy
B were pressed into service from neigh
boring banana plantations. Raynes has
also two cannon and filten cases of guns,
with which to arm the natives who are
expected to rise for Bonilla. The revolu

NASHVILLE, Term., May 6.â The air
ship on wnich Protessor Arthur W. Bar

Young Men's Christian Association of
this city, has been laboring a long timo
made its initia journey to-day. The ship
lias been in process of completion for sev

exposition grounds.
It was brought out this morning to the
treat astonishment of even most of the
officials, as the secret had been carefully
guarded. At 11:15 o'clock O. C. Barnard,
dolling his hut to the exposition officials
and several hundred visitors, aaid:
"Well, I'm off!"
He mounted a bicycle-like contrivance
attached to a tiemendous balloon, with
sail propellers at the front and sides.
In mute wonder the assemblage gazed at
the ship as she rose slowly from the earth.
Then, as Barnard had promised, she
made a bee line over tho Northwestern
railway at a rate of speed of about fifteen
miiri an hour.
Barnard returned to-night. He had
gone about twelve miles when one of the
propellers broke, compelling him to de
scend, which he did easily. He will make
another trip in a few days.
The ship is of watermelon shape, 46 feet
long and 20 feet ia diameter. Instead of
the basket attachment of a balloon, the
ship has a bicycle frame, and, by means of
pedals and handles, the propeller and side
sails are controlled.
The propeiier extends ten feet in front
of tbe machine and consists of reversible
sails about onr-twentieth the size of the
balloon part overhead. At either side of

WAR IS OVER
BUT PEACE IS
NOT IN SIGHT.
Such Is Now the Somewhat
Paradoxical Situation
in Greece.
WHY KING GEORGE'S TROOPS
LEFT PHARSALA.
Evacuated to Take Up What Is Declared an
Impregnable Position at Dohmoko â New
Complications Arise, but the
Powers Will Intervene.
[Copyrighted 1897, Dy the New Yorfc Snn.J
LONDON, Eng., May 6.â The *var is
virtually over, but peace is by no means
in sight. Such is the paradoxical situa
tion at the present moment. Latest in
formation from all sources shows the bat
tle of Pharsala was not a Greek victory,
as it was represented to have been. This
is made clear by the general retreat of the
Greek army last night to Domoko.
Detailed reports given in other dis
patches maice it evident that this is not
another evidence of cowardice and ineffi
ciency on the ysTt of the Greek command
ers. On the contrary, it was an inexorable
military necessity forced by the immense
ly superior strength of the enemy, which
made success teyond hope in the great
battle expected to-day.
Pharsala was merely occupied after it
had been evacuated. Its capture during
battle would have iuvolved the capture of
the major portion of the Greek army,
whereas the new position at Doraoko la
described as irapregnab'e as against a
vastly superior force.
The chances of Greek resistance have
rapidly diminished during the past few
days, despite the improvement of the
morale of the Greek troops. The Turks
have rushed forward re-enforcements to
Edhem Pasha's array. It is amazing to
note that 42,000 troops passed through
Salonica and Elassona within a week.
Forty thousand were engaged at Pharsala
yesterday. Moreover everybody in Athens
now admits that Greek success is impossi
ble, and the desire to retrieve Greek honor
will not be gratified by a desperate battle
acainst heavy odds, which is almost cer
tain to result in the capture of the surviv
ing participants.
The question hangs for the moment on
the intervention of the powers, which
Greece hopes for but still refuses to ask.
There is a conflict of evidence on this
point.
The correspondent of the Sun at Con
stantinople telegraphs to-night that Rus
sia is sounding the Porte and also the
Government at Athene in favor of media
tion. It is admitted elsewhere outside of
Athens that Greece is seeking an armis
tice and believes the powers are on the
point of intervening, but the London
Foreign Office flatly denies that any agree
ment has been reached. There seems to
be good reason to believe that Russia ai
least actively favors interference, possibly
in sympathy with her two new allies.
Everything indicates on the whole that
the cessation of hostilities is close at
hand, if it has not been already arranged.

In the meantime fresh complications
have arisen in Constantinople. Three of
the Embassadors yesterday discussed tha
Porte' s note to France in reference to the
protection of Greek subjects.
Russia unexpectedly objected to the inÂ«
troductioti of a new principle â that of the
protection of the subjects of one bellige
rent power against tbe will of the other.
The result of Russia's attitude was a con
certed request to the Porte to extend the
time for the exodus oi" the Greek?. Tha
Porte has made a reply to Russia's re
markable attitude ana suggests that she
wishes for her own purposes to secure ttia
expulsion of the large Greek population of
Constantinople.

FORCED TO RETREAT.
Greeks Could Not Cope With the
Overwhelming Numbers of
the Turks.
LONDON, Ewe., May 6.â The corre
spondent of the Daily Mai! at Pharsala
says: Yesterday's battle was a most sub
lime spectacle and had the most decisive
result of any battle of the war. It was
not the intention to have a pitched en
gagement, but when, at 'J o'clock in the
morning, Elbem Pasha arrived at tha
outposts to reconnoiter the enemy's posi
tion north of Pharsala a furious fire began.
The enemy had a good position about six
miles northward, secured by earthworks.
Along the low green hilh were two Greek
brigades in advance of the line. Two half
brigades formed the reserve, the whole
force numbering 20.000 men. The Turks
numbered about 50,01)0. Not all, however,
were engaged.
The battle was opened by the artillery.
The Greeks shot better than usual, but in
two hours began to retire across the river.
Tiiis was a great mistake, they being
thereby shut between the river and the
moun taiis without room to deploy. The
Greeks in places fought with the courage
of despair.
Great black masses, forming the rear
guard to hold the bridge, covered the
plain. The endurance an<l dsafa of tha
Turks was magnificent. The Greeks were
repulsed and vigorously pursued across
the plain, where the Turks had drawn a
semi-circle of thundering batter es. The
division on the extreme right tried to cut
off the retreat cf the Greeks to Doraoko.-
The remainder were flung against Phar2
Map Showing Edhem Pasha's Advance Upon Pharsala and Volo and the Greek Lines of Retreat.
The operations of the la*t few days have resulted in the abandonment by tho Greets of their second line of defense and the occupation by the Turks of the whole
stretch of the Thessalian plains from Tnskala on the west to Viatani and Velestino on the east, with all the line of the Thessalian X ulroad except a small piece lying
east oi Pilva L pc Gap and lying in the plain of Volo.
G eneral Smolensk. 's division after holding Velestino for a week against repeated assaults from great odds has retired to Volo and Haimyros, in either of which places,
with the means of retreat by sea open, they are for the time safe from any flank movement which might result in their being cut off and captured. With the assistance
of the war-ve?ae!s in tbe harbor they may continue to hold Volo and threaten Edhem Pas a's lines of communication by rail from Larissa.
After sharp lighting yesterday before the town the Greeks fell back last night from Pharsala upon Dhomoko, to which the main body of the central division of the
army had already preceded them. Dhomoko is some fifteen m.les south oF Pharsala, well up in the Orthrys Mountains. The town does not lie on the main road to
Athens, but at the junction of two others, whic > leading up from the plain between Karditza and Pharsala, unito here and join the main road a short distance below.
On a high hill jest east of the town, in a position to command all these roads and very ditticult of access, is a fort erected since 18S1 which can be made a serious ob
stacle to the Turkish advance.
These movements have further demonstrated Edhem Pasha's ability as a commander and shown that he is fully alive to every advantage offered by the nature ot
itry and the direction and character of the roads traversing it. When the Greek army retreated from Larissa, instead of following them up promptly by the
Pharsala road, he avoided fighting a way over that rough country; but sending divisions ovar good roads against Trikkala by way of Zaikas on the west and against Veles
tino on the ea=t, he created such diversions from the Greek center at Pharsala that he couid leisurely move Ins own central division directly upon that point, meet ing
ion until he was on tne Cvnocephalae Hills overlooking the town and in possession of the advanced post of the Greeks at Tatari, which, with the appearance of
his men on the road- between Karditsa and Pnarsala, made a longer stay for the Greeks unsafe.
ea a. The Turks kept shouting "Allah"
until the constant repetition swelled into
a heavy, monotonous ciiorus. Before 5
r. Â»i. the last village north of the river
had been taken. Then the village of Ya-
Biii and entrenchments near the river were
stormed, with some loss to '.he Turks.
Tl.e battle ceased at nightfall. A flank
in.' division was established bahind the
Greeks, cutting their best line of retreat
to Athens.
The Morning Post has a dispatch from
its correspondent with the Turkish army
contirmin^ the reports that the Turks
were successful all along the line and
Pharsala captured. The greater range of
the Turkish artillery caused serious losses
to the Greeks. The Turks continually ad
vanced under cover of their guns until
they c > ii i d almost touch the Greek lines.
The Crown Prince then ordered a retreat.
A dispatch this afternoon says an Eng
lish vessel bound for Saionica passed the
Greek fleet Monday night at the entrance
to the Gulf of Sf.lon:ca. The fleet was
proceeding in the direction of Saionica.
The Athens cci respondents of the Stan
dard, Telegraph and Chronicle concur in
saying the powers have instructed their
envoys to inteivene spontaneously be
tween Turkey and Greece. It seems tlm
decision was taicen owing to Greece's
steady refusal to ask mediation. The
Austrian and German Ministers received
late tc-night instructions of the same
tenor as those which previously reached
their colleagues.
The Chronicle's Athens correspondent
to-night asserts the collective note w:ll be
concurrently handed to Greece and Tur
key to-night or to-morrow, calling upon
both to cease hostilities, the powers un
dertaking a solution of their differences.
The Telegraph's correspondent gives as
conditions of the powers tue evacuation
of Thessaly by the Turks, Crete by the
Greeks and a restoration of statuÂ« quo
ante bellum as iar as Greece is con
cerned.
Concerning these reporis that the
powers have intervened to put a stop to
the war, the Sun's correspondent was
officially informed at the Foreign Oth're
at 5 o'clock this afternoon that the
powers had arrived at no such decision.
The arrest of Sir Ell:s Asbmead Bart
lett, member of Parliament lor the
Ecelesail division of Sheffield, who with
his son was captured on a schooner near
Piatamona by a warship of the Greek
eastern squadron and is now being con
veyed to Athens, was treated in a jocular
manner in the House of Commons to-day.
(Sir Ellis has all along been a most fervid
philo-Turk in Parliament.
Vice-Admiral Edward Field asked a
long question, which was frequently punc
tuated with ioslTs of laughter, finishing by
demanding the immediate release of Sir
Ellis by the Greek authorities and a
huiub c apology for the iudignity put
upon him.
James Caldwell asked the Government
to obtain the liberation of Sir Ellis' son,
who, he Baid, whs in no ways answerable
for the acts of his father. [Laughter.]
Ourzon thanked the members for their
soliciiude -in b?nalf of Si* Ellis, who he
feit Mire was in no personal danger.
[Lam.h'.er.] He would be handed over to
the British Legation as soon as he arrived
in Athens.
The annual meeting of the Primrose
i League was held in Albert Hall to-day.
| The hall was packed by members, com- ;
j prising a great number of the moat dis

! best-known clergy and most prominent
j ladies in England. Salisbury addressed
i the meeting and said the Treaty of Paris
engaged each of the six powers signatory
thereto to respect tho integrity of Turkey.
The English, he said, were not losing any
thing by adhering to the Treaty ol Pans.
The fact was the six powers were bound
together by an agreement which forced
| them into a federation, the object of
j which was to prevent a European war.
I Keeping Greece and Turkey from conflict
! was of course desirable, but a secondary
J matter. The concert of the powers had
not failed iv its primary object, for he
hopea all danger of a general European
war had passed away.
ROME, Italy, May Râ An Athens dis
patch says Amilcar Cipriani, the Italian
socialist leader who went to Greece with a
j number of volunteers to tight against the
Turks, was arrested at Athens to-day upon
the charge of instilating the recent public
disorders. He wa3 rescued, however, by a
crowd of sympathizers who closed aronnd
the police ana forced them to relinquish
Cipriani, who was borne away in triumph
by the mob. It is believed Cipriani will
be expelled from Greece as soon as the
authorities find him.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Tubkey, May 6.â
Edhem Pasha telegraphs, in reference to
the fighting at Pharsala, that the Greeks
were gradually driven from all their posi
tions until, after fifteen hours' hard fight
ing, the Turks established the.nselves in
front and in the rear of Pharsala, besides
destroying the railway at Volo.
In a later dispatch E'ihem Pasha adiled
the Turks had occupied Pharsaia
and the Greek intrenchments. The
Greeks, he said, were hurriedly retreating
to Doraoko, closely pressed by the cavalry.
ATHENS, Greece, Maj o.â The Greek
army has taken a position at Domoko,
i about twelve miles southwest of Pharsala.
I The staff of Crown. Prince Constantino
held a council last evening and decided,
as the Turks were receiving large re-en
forcements, enabling them to greatly out
number tho Greeks, that the success of
the Greeks was impossible. It was there
fore decided to retire to Doraoko.
The Government authorities assert they
have reason to believe the powers have
intervened and say Greece will accept an
armistice if proposed by the European
Governments.
To Protect the Dynasty.
LONDON, E.\-g., May 6â The Daily
Mail's Berlin dispatch says it is reported
that the powers have decided to land
troops at Athens to protect the dynasty,
Greece having declined the proffered

HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 29.âYes
terday was the twelfth day since the last
of the six cases of smallpox among the
Japanese immigrants at the quarantine
station broke out, and it was expected
that further danger wa3 over. Another
mild case was reported early yesterday
morning, which means eighteen addi
tional days' quarantine for 13!) Japanese.
The 50l Chinese contract laborers brought
on the Doric are quarantined iv anoiher
part of the island. They will be released
when their eighteen days from Yokohama
are up, as they were all vaccinated and
quarantined before embarking at Hong
kong.
Minister Cooper, Collector - General
Castle and the other officials who were
exposed to smallpox while examining tho
status of the immigrants previous to their
landing from the Kinai-maru, wre re
leased from quarantine on the 27ih, and
are now at their desks making up for lost
time.
By the Doric the Japanese Minister re
ceived his credentials from the Emperor,
and he was given an audience by Pre-i
--dent Dole on the day following. Tho pro
ceedings were quite imposing. Minister
Shimamura, resplendent in a gorgeous
uniform, altendea by Mr. iln.ii, Secretary
of Legation, went in a carriage to the ex
ecutive building. He was received with
the usual military guard of honor.
Minister Slumainura received several
very important dispatches together with
his credentials, tiie contents of which he
is guarding with jealous care, inter
viewed as to their nature he would only
say:
"I am convinced that only the free im
migration to these islands has been
temporarily stopped by my GoTernment.
There can be no question over tho right of
the Japanese contract laborers consigned
to responsible parties to land on Hawaii,
and I believe that my Government realizes
this."
About the coming of one or two Japan
ese battle-ships to Honolulu Minister
Shimamnra stated that he knew nothing.
The Wilder Steamship Company's
steamer Likeliko is a total wreck, having
struck on a rock off Honoipu, a port on

cargo of sujj r nnd other freight was
saved. The Likelike was built by Dickey
Brothers in San Francisco in 1877, and
was brought to the islands the same year

over the published interviews with the

here, immediately after the Board of
Health decided that the Minister and his

of courtesy and regret. It was the inten

By the Australia's mail the Foreign
Office received a cablegram from Tokio,
by way of San Francisco, sayinn that a
special as-ent of the Japanese Government
had left Yokohama on the cruiser Naniwa
for Honolulu to investigate the immigra

President Dole and Minister Damon
made an offlciel call on Admiral Beards
lee shortly alter the arrival of the Aus
tralia, which gave rise to rumors that the
Government .had received important
news. It, was officially denied that there
was any significance in the visit.
President Dole celebrated the fifty
third anniversary of his birthday on the

The Japanese community had a big
meeting last Friday night in honor of

dresses were adopted congratulating the
Minister. He was also presented with a
handsome gola-mounted coffeewood cane

house, whiie the meeting amused itself
with some Japanese dancins-girls.

A horrible case of harakiri occurred in
this city last Saturday. A Japanese named
Himai cut his wiif's throat from ear to
ear in two places and then disemboweled
himself. Both were covered with smaller
stabs about the arms and cheat. The
deed was done with a razor. The man
died on Sunday, but, strange to hay, the
woman is still alive, though it is hardly
possible sho can recover.
Labor Commissioner Fitzperald has re
turned from his tour of the islands and
may leave !or home on this steamer. He
had a meeting with some leading mem
bers of the Planters' Association on Tues
day, and yesterday be met President Dole
and the Cabinet in a session which lasted
two hours. A synopsis of hi* forthcom
ing report may be gathered from the fol
lowing interview published m the Ha
waiian Star of his return from Hawaii.
Said be:
Everywhere we were met with grent franu
ness on the part of the planters and unex
pected courtesies were thrust upon us. No
where aid we meet with ihe slightest opposi
tion or reticence. The panters seem more
than anxious to secure the white labor, but
they cio not seem yet to grasp the idea of how
to bring about a change in the existing con
ditions. I could have lakon orders for a num
ber of white laborers, but it would have been
no use. If this change is to be effected it must
be done in a systematic and businesslike way
by ih<> peop c here. The change cannot bs
sudden and rndical; it must be brought about
slowly, but steadily and tirmiy. It is no great
undertaking, after all, when properly com
menced.
In my opinion whita labor can perform 80
per cent of the labor on tue plantations wito
out any hardship vhntever, and all of it with
out excessive conditions. Even the much
talked of labor of bearing the land can be
performed by whi'e men, and I will guarantee
that the land will be mucti better cleaned than
it i 9 by these little brown fellows. From
what I have seen of this cheap labor it Is the
cheapest kind of laborâ but not for the em
ployer. A white man could do twice the work
I have seen these Chinese and Japanese doing,
in less time and with more satisfactory re
suits, witnout grumbling or considering him
self overworked. But he could not live as
t!:ey doâ nor could any civilized human
being.
Tue labor question here is a simple one. In
California we had to pass twenty-one iaws be
fore we could eradicate the many evils that
had crept into our system there. Tnere are
none of those bad features here. There is no
need ot legislation. The only questions to ba
considered are ihe amount ot pay and the
ability of the laborer to <iothe work. The em
ploye can live better here evun than in Cali
lornia, and there is no question but tnac he
will receive his pay 11 he performs the work
required of him.
No class of people recognize the necessity of
a cbantre in the labor conditions better than
the coffee-planters. Collet -plan ling is now
beyond the experimental period, and within
the next iew years there will be lrom 5000 to
10,000 acres of land producing coffee.
There )s practically no labor to handle such
a crop, nor cm there be under the present
conditions. The picking season lasts but three
months, at the most, and during that period
the ratio of labor necessary to handle tho crop
must be increased from otoÃto 1. If whites
were employed on the island on the sugar
plantations, their children could do the pick
ing. The coffee-planter is powerless to heip.
It ail rests witti the sugar-planter.
Now is the time f'jr action. Belay at this
time may ruin ihe agricultural industries of
the islands. The longer it is putoff the harder
it will be to cnange the conditions.

\CONFEREES CAN
NEVER AGREE
So the Dingley Bill Must
Pass as It Leaves
the Senate.
Comparative Statements of
Old and New Tariffs Are
Being Printed.
One Expert Declares the Measure
Will Produce Ali the Revenue
Required.
WASHINGTON, D. C. ; May 6.-The Re
publicans of the Senate and House have
had no conference looking to the adoption
oi a programme lor passing the tariff bill.
Venturesome members of the lower
branch, like Groavenor, continue to de
nounce ttie Senate bill, but Reed, Dingley
and other leaders remain silent. Demo
crats are also still emphatic in their de
nunciation of the measure, but profess to
ntirely sincero in staling they will
offer no factious opposition in the Senate.
The announcement of the intention of
finally disposing of the bill by having the
House accept it as passed by the Senate
bas aroused an interesting discussion as
to whether this programme will be car
ried ou'. Leaders are unwilling to state
at this early that the plan adopted
for passing the Wilson bill is to De fol
lowed, but privately they admit ulti
mately this will be necessary.
It may be deemed impolitic for the
Senate to refuse the House's request for a
conference committee, but it is apparent
even now that if the conierees be ap
pointed they would find no basis of agree
ment and would be compelled to per
functorily retort the fact from tc time
an 1 :isk either for further instructors or
to le discharged.
Trns was the case with trie Wilson bill,
It wen to to a conference committee, but no
attempt was made to agree, because the
views of the Â£e;;ate and the House were
radically opposed. The bill, of course,
be materially amended during the
debate in the Senate. But it is the gen
eral opini >n it cannot be made acceptable
H,u-esoas to be approved in the
ordinary course by t tie conference com
niinee and that its acce; tance as passed
by ihe Senate is the only logical outcome
of the difference of opinion.
As announced in the Senate by Allison
to-day the bill is being printed in such c
wav it can be readily compared with the
Dingley bill and the present Jaw. Ttiis
arative statement will be ready by
Saturday, and the Democratic meniDsrs
of the Finance Committee will immedi
ately tegin the task of informing them
selves on its details in readiness for at
tacking the measure In the Senate. In
the meantime it is thougnt Chairman
Kngley or some member of the Way* and
Means Committee, speaking for the Re
publicans of the House, will formally ex
press an opinion of the bill as it stands.
Several^, members. of â  both hove*u c* hive
tariff t-Xr/erts now engaged in estimating
the amount of revenue that would be de
rived Iroiu the bill as now framed. The
most interesting statement of this k;nd is
that of T. S. Suarstts of the Board of Gen
eral Appraiser?, who says:
"In rry opinion the bill will produce
jiutticient revenue to meet the demands of
the Government. The duty on tea will
aggregate $10,000,000, while the increase
provided in the beer tax will amount to
from $12,000,000 to 5U.000.000 more. The
increased duty on sugar will result in a
material gain to the volume of revenue
over that produced by the act of 1891.
I:. deed, this kiC/ease aione would be al
most sufficient, if times were prosperous,
n produce the additional revenue neees
to support the Government, as defi
ciency un<ier that act was largely due to
depressed conditions. I estimate the in
crease of the sugar duty over the Wilson
law to amount on tha average to about 35
per cent. I don't believe the increased
rate will materially affect the volume of
importations. There will also be a large
addition from wool. I think the increase
iroru this source will exceed the possible
decrease from manufacturers of wool due
to :he rate being prohibitive on lower
grades of wool- mixed goods. The cotton
BChednle shows very little change from
the Wilson law, and the sami- may be said
of the metal, tlnx and sundries schedules.
The increased revenues on artices in
clulpd in these schedules do not exceed
15,090,000. 1 think there will be a falling
off in tobacco, for the reas >n thst while
rates are the same as in the Wilson bill
there is ;. limitation on the tariff of to
bacco suitable for wrappers contained in
fuller bales which will necessarily work a
reduction in the revenue from tins source.
The change reduces the percentage from
1") to 5 per cent. This reduction will re
sult in causing a very large pioportion of
Havana tobacco to be imported."

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 6. -Repre
sentative Barlow of the Los Angele* dis
trict made a iierce attack on the admin
istration to-day. This is the outcome of
the uupieasant interview he had with
Secretary Alger a few days ago. Bariow
complains that the Secretary treated him
with scant courtesy when he called to
ascertain why the act of Congress appro
bating money for a deep harbor ai San
Pedro was not carried out. Uarlow to
day introduced the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Secretnry of War be and
he i- hereby requested to communicate to the
House at the earliest date thut may be practi
cable what, if anything, has been done toward
the building of h hart of refuge and com
merce nt San Pedro, Calliori iv, as provided
for by law; and if nothing has been done,
why the law has not been cÂ»rriÂ« d out, and
fiow soon bids will bs invited for the
prosecution of .'aid wort, as contemplated In
the statute making appropriation thereior.
Barlow alleged t. at the administration
was in league with Huntington, the rail
roads and other corporations. At the
request ot Mr. D:ngley the resolution wai
withdrawn for the time being.
.Sena; or White said to The Call corre
spondent to-nigut that He would call on
Secretary Alger again to-morrow. At his
last visit", several weeks ago, he intimated
that he intended to present a resolution
in the Senate similar to that introduced
In the House, but Secretary Alger asked
him not to, but to delay it. Alger gave
or White to understand that he
would prepare advertisements /or bids for
tV work at San Pedro.
"That is all we want," said the Sena
tor.
It is understood that the San Pedro har
bor matter was considered at a meeting of
tlie t'lbinet several weeks a:'O and Presi
dent McKinley stronply urged that rigid
economy be the rule until an adeqnate rev
enue was provided to replenish the Treas-
ury.
But Senator White says that not a dol
lar of t c Treasury's money will be needed
lor a year and that the Administration*!
pretext for non-action is unreasonable,
RETIREMENT OF ADMIRALS.
Nay at Offic rs f/xng Up a Scheme to
Insure Promotion Before Bung
Relegated.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 6.â lf the
bit 1 lan arranged by several of the higher
cllicers of the navy is carried out there
will be more admirals and commodores
applying for retirement in the next two
months than the navy has known since
the war. The ooject of the plan is to ad
vance two oflicers to the grade of rear-ad
miral, which would not bs attained other
wise.the assignment of Commodore Dewey
instead of Admiral Milier to command the
Pacific fleet and a g neral shifting about
of stations ana duties consequent upon
retirements and promotions. Commo
dores Phvthian and Wallace, who will re
tire in the next Jew months in the present
grade unless unexpected vacancies be se
cured for them, are said to bo the fathers
of the scheme. Both want to be r<-ar
adnurals and are willing to give up a large
part o; their salary if they can induce Ad
miral Miller and Commodore Norton, who
are ahead of them, to make way.
It will be necessary for tliem to pay
these otticers the money they would lose
by retiring ahead of tha regular time.
The department will not oppose the plan
if the admirals aDd commodores can ar
ran.e it, and will place any ot" them on
the retired List that some junior be ad
vanced i:i grade before being re.egatedalso.
Both iliher ami Norton are said to be
willing to make application for retirement.
One thing which may prevent the pro
gramme being carried out is the Queen's
jubilee, 10 which Miller goes to represent
the navy.
Miller's orders are to return and go to
Honolulu as commander of the Pacific
station. Should he be detained longer
than July 15 the whole scheme will bo up
set, for Phythian will be retire 1 six days
later and no time will be afforded for
Norton's promotion and retirement to
make way for Phythian.
M.iler and Norton do not retire for
eighteen months. It is proposed now that
Miller shall retire, making Norton a rear
admiral. Norton to retire immediately in
order to give the vacancy to Phythian,
who in turn goes out July 21, thus dis
posing of three rear-admirals at once and
giving Wallace the next commodore's va
cancy created by Phythian's retirement.
Walluce would retire in November. The
fact ihat Commodore D<?wey is now prac
tically certain to be sent to the Pacific
makes it highly probable that Miller in
tends leaving London in time to retire in
the interest of those below him.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 61â A num
ber of army officers have made applica

United States embassies and legations,
and are bringing great pressure on the

rule that ofticeis who have had such
assignments within recent years or have
not served rive years with their regiments
will not be considered for the places.

Voted Down.
Ex-President Was Referred To
as a Disgrace to Civili
zation.
Sundry Civil Bill Passes, Carrying
With It an Appropriation of
$54,000,000.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 6.â ln the
Senate to-day a new arbitration joint reso
lution was introduced by Bacon (D.) of
Georgia and referred to the Committee on
Foreign Relations. It declares that the
United States deprecate war and desires
the maintenance of peace and friendship
with all; that they favor the principle and
practice of international arbitration, and
invite all civilized nations to make corre
sponding declarations.
The sundry civil appropriation bill was
taken up, the pending question being on
the amendment of yesterday by Pettigrew
looking to the suspension of Cleveland's
proclamation setting apart many million
acres of public timber lands as forest
reservations. Allison, in charee of the
bill, said he favored a modification of
Cleveland's order, but the pending amend
ment went further than he could approve.
He admitted the order wns improvident
and did injustice to great masses ot peo
ple. He said the President and Cabinet
are giving attention to the subject and
preparing to right the wrone.
Wilson broke into Allison's speech with
the remark that if the same thing had oc
curred in lowa which had occurred in far
Western States it would be in rebellion.
White of California concurred in the
view ihat Cleveland's order was improvi
dently made, and said the law should at
least be amended so as to allow mining
entries to be made within the limits of
reservations.
Pettigrew said his amendment simply
proposed to suspend Cleveland's order
and authorize the President to establish
new forest reservations In these areas
where it is proper that they beestahlished.
Warren, White, Ciark, Turner and Raw
lins championed Pettigrew's amendment,
while Cleveland's act was defended by
Gray and Gorman.
Cleveland's order was characterized by
Clark as showing "absolute and intoler
able ignorance."
An indignant protest was made by Tur
ner against requiring Senators who call
at the Executive .Department in relation
to th"se lorest reservations "to kick their
shins in the corridor."
"While Senators from the entire West,"
White claimed, "stand together and pre
sent this unbroken front regardless of pol
itics some attention ought to be paid to
our demand."
Gray asserted Cleveland's action was
the result of investigation started by Con
gress and intrusted to the National Asso
ciation of Science. He doubted very
much whether tne interests of the people
had suffered. Certain greedy interest
might have suffered, but it was time to
save those great territories of nature from
the spoliation of speculators.
Rawiins saw in Cleveland's action an
outrage similar to that committed by
William the Conqueror when he turned
an extensive English district into a hunt
ing reserve.
Pettigrew referred to Cleveland as a
"disgrace to civilization and a disgrace to
the Nation."
Gorman, in criticizing the amendment,
referred to the House as having no pres
ent legislative facilities. White also
spoke of the House being under "legisla
tive padlock."
During the discussion Secretary Sher
man came into the chamber and took a
seat, first beside Allison and then beside
Mo gan, with whom he conversed some
time.
The motion by Allison to strike out of
the amendment so much of it as declares
Cleveland's proclamation suspended and
lands restored to the public domain was
defeated. Allison then withdrew all fur
ther objections and appealed to Gorman
to withdraw his point of order. Gorman,
however, declined and Pettierew asked the
Yice-Prasident to submit the point of or
der to the Senate. The vote resulted ayes
25, noes 23. So the amendment was de
clared in order and was agreed to without
further division.
It authorizes the President to revoke,
modify or euspend any and all of the ex
ecutive orders and proclamations setting
aside forest reservations and it immedi
ately suspands the orders and proclama
tions of the 22 1 of February last setting
apart lands in Wyoming, Utah, Montana,
Washington. laalio and South Dakota
and restores these to the public domain.
Allison offered an amendment appro
priating $25,000 for continuing the investi
gation of seal fisheries, and for the better
protection of seal life and seal interests,
with a view to the final settlement of the
question.
To that Pettierew offered as a substitute
a bill passed by the Hoase during the Jasl
Congress, and reported by the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations on the
4th of March, 189 U. for killing of all seals
on Pribiloff Islands. Pettigrew argued
that if that substitute was agreed to the
British Government would put a stop to
the barbarous butchery of seals by pelagic
poachers; otherwise sucu butchery would
go on .
The Vice- President sustained a point of
order aeain-t Pettigrew's substitute, and
Allison's amendment was agreed to.
Ap. item of $4), 000 for keeping open the
channel of Mob:le Bay was inserted, and
the item of $200,000 for Government
buildings and exhibits at the Omaha Ex
position was increased to $175,000. The
sundry civil bill then passed, it appro
priates atout f54.000.C00
The matter of the Nicaragua Canal
Commission, under consideration yester
day, was taken up. Hale offered an
amendment requiring the commission to
consist of five in-tead of three. The bill
now provides that the commission shall
consist of one officer from the navy, cne
Ironi the army and an engineer from civil
life.
Frye reported from the Committee on
Commerce the bill to adopt resolutions
governing the navigation of rivers, har
bors and other inland waters of the United
Sates, except the great lakes, to carry
the recommendations of the American
delegates to the International Maritime
Congress. The bill was read and passed,
and the Senate, at 6:15 o'clock, adjourned
till Monday.
T MiI IS JtAIS AT A. TIME.
lhat la the Period for Which the House
.Aomj Adjourn*.
WASHINGTON, D. CL, May 6.â A two
hours' session of tne House to-day result
ed in crystallizing into permanent form
the policy heretofore pursued by tbe ma
jority of adjourning for three days at a
time.
Dalzell's resolutions providing that un
til further orders the meeting days of the
House shall be Monday and Thursday,
was adoptedâ lol to 84, with 14 members
paired. Trie negative vote was cast by
the Democrats and Populist".
Bailey, the Democratic leader, opposed
the resolution for the reason that it meant
the virtual indefinite postponement of
the bankruptcy bill.
Dalzell denied this, and said that as
soon as Henderson, chairman of the Coni
mittt-e on Judiciary in the last Congress,
returned, the matter would be taken up.
The debate was noticeable for the rirst ap
pearance o' McMillin of Tennessee in the
role of critic ot the policy of his success
ful opponent for the honor of the Demo
cratic leadership (Bailey), although he
disclaimed any intention to criticize. The
effect of to-day's action will be to obviate
the necessity for Dingley to move, each
time the House meets, that it adjourn for
three days.
It if Unttlr-xhip lowa.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 4.â The

LIBERAL RELIGION
RAISES A RUMPUS
An Episcopalian Bishop
Accused of Rank
Heterodoxy.
Arraigned by the Clergymen
of Many Other Sects in the
Far South.
Peculiar Doctrinal Strife Stlr3
Louisiana Churches to Their
Very Foundations.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 6.â The
Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and
Lutheran clergy of this State have nnited
to try and secure a trial of BishopDavis bes
suius of the I'rotestant Episcopal church
for heterodoxy. Trials for heterodoxy
have been frequent of late, but this is tue
first time it has beeD proposed that sev
eral Protestant sects should unite to try
a minister of another sect, and Bishop,
too, and the affair promises to precipitate
strife between the several Protestant
denominations. â >
The trouble has been brewing since
April 21, when Bishop Sessums, in a ienten
sermon, preached, so his enemies assert,
an entirely new relicion whicu ignored
the doctrines of Christianity and the
Bible, and substituted a broad numani
tananism recognizing the universe as
God and the final pardon of all sinners
whether repentant or not.
To-day the matter was precipitated
among all the Protestant clergy on tha
very severe arraignment of Bishop Ses
sums by the Presbyterian, Methodist,
Baptist and Lutheran clergy as not teach
ing Christian religion, but abhorrent
pantheism. It now appears that the
clergy of these denominations sent him a
protest two weeks ago in which they asked
him to avow or di-avow the sermon at
tributed to him. The Bishop sent no
answer and to-day the clergy arraigned
him for teaching damnable heresies. Tne
arraignment was headed by Rev. B. M.
Palmer, for nearly half a century con
sidered the most eloquent clergyman in
the South and the mobt eminent leader ol
the Southern Presbyterian church, and by
eignteen Presbyterian, seventeen JMntho
dist, twelve Lutneran and three Baptist,
ministers, practically the entire Protestant
clergy of Nsw Orleans, with the exception
of the Ej.'iscopnlians.
Tneir specifications include; Hia deny
ing the personality of the Divine Being;
fall of man; that Christ hath "redeemed
us with his blood" is not a sacrificial offer
ing for sin, but consisting merely in the
influence of good example; absolute de
nial of future punishment of the wicked
in the world to come.
As Presbyterian, Methodist, Lutheran
and Baptist churches have no ecclesiasti
cal jurisdiction over the Bishop it is diffi
cult to see how they can go any further.
Their aim seems to be to force the Episco
pal church to take some action.
GOULD AND SAGE.
They Hare Quarreled Over a Bagatelle
of $2,400,000 and Missouri Pacific
Stocks Go Down.
NEW YORK. N. V., May Â«.â The Jour
nal says Russell Sage and George Gould
fora bagatteleof $2,400,000;bave quarreled.
Gould stocks have been weak some time
on account of tbe row and were excep
tionally weakyesterdty. Missouri Pacific
sunk to 10. It was worth 55 when Jay
Gould died.
According to a friend of Rage, he be
came suspicious over the depreciation of
live millions of bonds floated for Mis
souri Pacific construction work, and upon
inquiring became convinced that 300
miles of construction had been paid for at
the rate of $I<> 000 a mile, when it should
cost but $8000. Sage explained his dis
coveries to George GoulJ, w; o denied all
knowledge of the matter, but promised to
look into it.
This occurred early in 1896. Sage dia
not press his claim then, as the Western
Union-Bell telephone contract wa3 about
to expire, and the separation of the Sage
and Gould interests would have been a
very serious matter.
After this contract bad been renewed
Sage insis.ed tbnt the Gould estate mane
restitution of $2,400,000 involved in his
claim of overpayment in the Missouri Pa
cific Construction Company. Gouid re
fused, and from that time the Gould
estate has been steadily disposing of its
holdings in Missouri Pacific and other
btuck.i controlled jointly with Sage.

POMONA HOTEL
FIRED AT NIGHT
Drunken Porter Makes
Confession of the
Crime.
Prompted to the Diabolical
Deed by Motives of
Revenge.
Kerosene Freely Used, but Good
Work of the Firemen Prevents
a Holocaust.
POMONA, Cal., May 6.â The most dia
bolical case of incendiarism ever known in
Pomona Valley was that at the beautiful
Hotel Palomaers last night. There has
been nothing else talked of here to-day
and as additional facts come to light peo
pie are more excited Â«t the atrocity of the
crime.
At 11 o'clock last nipht people on the
streets saw flames bursting from the roof
of tbe Hotel Paloniaers on Garey aevnue.
Fortunately the city fire and hose house
is but three blocks distant and in two
minute 3 the firemen were on the scene.
For ten minutes they worked like Trojans,
the flames were subdued and no damage
but a hole in the roof and charred timbers
in the hotel attic resulted.
When the firemen had gone away City
Marshal Caldweil made an examination
of the upper part of the hotel. He found
that the lire had been purposely started in
several places.
Kerofene had been thrown over the
timbers in the attic and spilled along the
halls on the upper stories, while burned
matches and shavings showed that sev
eral fires had been started and for some
reason had died out.
Su-picion rested on the hotel porter,
benjamin Crews, who had been employed
tnere for several years. Marshul Caldweil
had a long talk with Crews and urged
him to tell the truth, and when the man
saw how strong the evidence was against
him he weakened.
Crews coniessed that in a drunken frenzy
an'l with the motive of revenge on the
Hotel Palomaers Company for some petty
reason he planned to burn the hotel build
ing to the ground. He was promptly
arrested and has been weeping in jail nere
ever since. He has made a written con
fession of his crime, in the hope that it
will help his defense when he comes up
for trial.
Crews is about 26 years old, and has a
wife and two children. The hotel com
pany has employed him for several years,
and he was regarded as an exemplary
character. The Hotel Palomaers is a
larpe wooden building. It cost over
$70,000, and is owned by Srailie Brothers
of OaKland, Richard Gird and A. T. Cur
rier. It has been partially closea for some
time, but some of its euests, among them
Cauitnlist Thomas Wick ware and wife of
San Francisco, were permitted to keep
rooms there. Had the hre been started
one hour later, when every one here was
abed, it is very likely that the whole
building would have burned to the ground
and human lives have been lost.
BIG RALLY OF THE TURNERS.
They B gin to Gather at St. Louis, Wh.ch
/s Gcyly Decorated in
Their Honor.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 6.â The Mound
City is gayly decorated to-day in honor of
the opening of the twenty-seventh fes
tival of the North American Gymnastic
Union.
This organization, formerly known as
the Turnerbund, has a membership ex
tending to every State and almost every
county in the Union, and its international
fests, which are held quadrennially, are
the great event of every four years in Ger
man turner circles.
Delegates have been arriving from out
side points for several days, and at the
headquarters of the reception committee
it is estimated this morning that fully
7000 members of the various gymnastic
unions of the country are on the ground.
This number will be increased by one
third within the next twenty-four hours.
Outside of the members of the unions
proper, the event attracts a great throng
of merry-making Germans, and it is cal
culated that fully 100,000 strangers will bs
in the city fcr the week of the lest.
The fair grounds have been rented for
the occasion, and most of tha exercises
will be held in the big field witnin the
racetrack. No prizes of money or medals
are awarded to the winners of tlie various
events, but they are crowned with laurel
wreaths and recognized with diplomas,
which are as highly prized by the victors
as rewards of greater intrinsic vnlue.
The laurel for the wreaths has been
brought by the California division.
The festival opened this afternoon with
a big street parade, following which the
athletic exercises commenced at the fair
grounds. By way of innovation, bicycle
races figure in the fest programme.
There will be the usual oratorical con
test, a:id one evening will be devoted to
prize singing. In tne calisthenics compe
tition there will be a warm straggle be
tween Davenport, Iowa; Milwaukee and
Cincinnati turners.
THIMTS'S lUCeyT&SMIAI,.
Exereia** in th* Church Whrr* George
M<i i.'< iiujton Worshiped.
NEW YORK, N. V., May âThe bicen
tennial exercises of Trinity Church were
continued 10-day, the address at the noon
service being delivered by Rev. Dr. Ilunt
ington of Grace Church.
~ To-night there was a celebration of all
the Sunday-schools in the parish at St.
Paul's chapel. So large was the number
of children representing the various Sun
day-schools connected with the parish
that it was impossible to seat them all in
St. Paul's, and accordingly the attendance
was limited to a representation of 100 from
each of the nine schools. These were ac
companied by acolytes and each bore its
school banner, the delegations uniting in
a grand festal service. The principal ad
dress was delivered by the Bishop of
Washington, Right Rev. Henry Yates
Satterlee.
It was in St. Paul's Church that Wash
ington worshiped, and the exercises to
nieht had special reference to the history
of the father of his country.
Trraiurer ilotcland't Body Found.
NEW BEDFORD, Mass., May 6.âTreas
urer Howland's body was found in tho
river this morninc Howland was treas
urer of the New Bedford mills which
failed. He has been missing since the
lailure. It whs not thought by those who
knew him that Howland was (he kind of
man to commit suicide. He has always
been a cheerful person and ready to take
a ro-eato view of life. There were always
those who doubted his honesty, however,
and when he disappeared they said be had
gone to Europe with funds belonging to
tbe mills. His friends, however, asserted
tliat he would return and clear himself.

eTÂ«nt.
Mr. B'erner attended this Grand Court
against the wishes oi his friends, as he
has been in poor health for some time,

RICH PLACERS NEAR CARSON.
Raycratt Brother's Sir ki (tip Channel
of an Old R.ver by Hy-
drauhcking.
(ARSON CITY, Ni:v., May 6â The
channel of the Jiuckeye placers has been
reached beyond a doub: by the Raycraft
brothers. The discovery was made dv
hydraulickmg in the face of a small hill
Which recedes from the canyon, where
operations have been goinc on for some
time, :ind the work had gone but twelve
feet when the immense bed of gravel
which comprised the old river channel
was uncovered. It was tested and found
to be very rich and some large nuggets
were taicen out.
The exact width has not been ascer
tained as yet, but already 100 feet have been
exposed and neithÂ»r edge has been struck.
Prospecting was uone down to twenty-six
feel and then the miners struck a harder
stratum than the rather low hydraulic
pressure of water would penetrate.
A stink and drift was then put in and it
wan found that the gravel continued on
down under this stratum and was even
richer than the top, while the gold was
coarser. No attempt, however, will be
made to penetrate the lower bed this
season in ail probability beyond merely
prospecting it, and a further exploration
of its riches will be postponed until better
facilities are obtained for handling it.
Upsides there is plenty of pay gravel on
top.

CHINESE COMING
FROM MEXICO
Entering Southern Cali
fornia by Dubious
Methods.
A Piratical Craft Lands a
Batch at San Juan
Capistrano.
They Are Promptly Taken in Tow
by an Officer and Held Tor
Deportation.
LOS ANGELES, Cal , May G.âContra
band Chinese are finding new ways of en
tering Calilornia, and the latest venture
of the smugglers was detected off San
Juan Capistrano yesterday. A long, low
and piratical-looking craft hove to just
off the mainland and a boat was lowered
from the davits. Into the dory were low
ered seven Chinese, and they were rowed
to tbe shore ana landed, after which the
schooner sailed away, leaving her passen
gere to thair fate.
The Chinese were met on shore by Don
Marco Foster, Deputy United States Mar
slial, and all were arrested by him for
illegally entering the United States. The
ollicer would have detained the schooner
also if he could have reached her, but she
tailed off toward the nortb.
It is supposed that the Chinese came
from Mexico, for their pockets were tilled
with Mcx can coins and there were other
evidences to lead to that conclusion. They
undoubtedly had no right to land thus in
the United States, and the vessel captain
who imported them evidently thought he
would be 6afe in landing at Capistrano,
where there was small likelihood of there
being a Federal officor.
Don Marco Foster is detaining his pris
oners at Capittrano and they wiil be
brought here for trial aud probable depor

LOS ANGELES, Cat.., May 6â The
office of industrial commissioner is a new

his duiy to study the conditions of the
localities in which his coniDany is inter

assisting the progress and prosperity of
the people.
At the Chamber of Commerce to-dny
Mr. Davis said tbac in the East there has
long been an impression that Southern
California was a sanitarium and nutbing
more, "but," he said, "you can feel as
sured that the commercial value of the
region excels its sanitary importance. I
feel sure that there is no article that is
neeied that cannot be produced nere.
'You do not know all the resources you
have and most of them are as yet un
touched. There is sugar alone. There is
no reason why Southern California should
not ba the sugar-bowl of the world. The
abrogation of the Hawaiian treaty will be
of great benefit and you will see sugar
beet plantations spring up all over this
Dart of the Slate. The beauty of the sugar
business is that the larmprs do not need
to be dependent on a refinery. Every
furmer can have his mill and make his
own unrefined sugar.

MARIN GHOSTS WALK NIGHTLY.
Arjo's fppantion in the County Jail /s
Joned by That of a Celestial Who
Hanged H mse/f.
BAN RAFAEL. Cal , May G.â There are
few who will now doubt the truth of the
stories publisned about tho ghost which
haunts the County Jail in the basement
of Marin County's Courthouse. Last night
it made its appsÃrao.ee to a Chinaman
named Wing Hi and almost snared the
unfortunate fellow to deatb. "When seen
to-day he told 'tie game story that has
come from the lips of other unfortunates
who have been contined in the haunted
chamber. At various times tt has been
said that the ghost of a Chinaman had
been seen by prisoners, and it was this
apparition t hut. made its presence known
to poor Wing Hi during the small hours
of this morning.
At. the fcjber it's ollice it was learned that
in one of the tanks to the cell where the
Mongolian win confined a Chinaman had
committed suicide. Like Argo. whose
ghost also haunts the prison, the China
man committed tin act of seif-destruction
by making a noose of his long queue,
placing it abotu his neck, attarning the
other end to the opening in the top of the
tank and lilting his feet from tne ground,
thus allowing himself to slowly strangle
to death.
Annie Kehoe, who saw the ghost of
Argo last month, also avid tliat a China
man'i face made its appearance. Now
comes Wing Hi, an ignorant Mongolian,
arrested for being insane, and without be
ing able to learn of the ghost's visits
through the newspapers, nor having any
method of knowing wnicn is the haunted
cell, tells the story as others have told it.
He does not talk with any degrep of intel
ligence, but he is able to tell of ths terror
which the apparition caused, and how he
passed the night in fear and trembling
lest the awful apetter should pounce upon
him and do him injury.

Man's Pocket
STOCKTON, Cal., May C â The third
trial of Fred Wittyâ one of the Witty
family of Sonntag and Evans fame -for
grand larceny, came up for hearing before
Judge Jones to-day. The case has been
bitterly fought and Attorney P. H. Gould
has succeeded In securing a jury disagree
ment three times.
Witty was charged with having robbed,
in a Mnin-street saloon, a man with whom
he hud been lor several hours, and who
had considerable money on bis person.
Witty was caught with his hands in the
man's packets, but his defense was that
his companion, while in a drunken con
dition, allowed his money to fall out of
his pickets to the floor, and that he had
merely gathered up the coins and ivas
plncing them back in his friend's pocket.
The trial has been watched with much
interest, as both the prosecution and de
fendants have made a hard fight. Dis
trict Attorney Nutter made an able argu

Grand- Parent* Fiercely Heslit a Man
date of the Court.
TACOMA, Wash., May 0. â The three
little Siegenthaler children, aged 2, 4 ana
ti years, caused considerable trouble. last
night. A year ago their father secured a
divorce and the custody of the children,
though they have been ever since with
their grand-parents, Mr., and Mrs. An-'
thony Ilinck, and their mother has sup
poried them.
Yesterday Riegenthaler got a writ of
habeas corpus and Deputy Sheriff Davis
was sent after the children. The Rincks
made so decided a remonstrance that he
way obliged to quit the house and obtain
the assistance of Deputy Ross and Detec
tive Concannon. When tht re-enforce
ments arrived the battle began in earnest.
The old grandfather and his infuriated
daughters threatened to shoot the ollicers
down like dote. They retaliated by hand
cuffing the family, and finally took the
aged grandfather to jail to cool off.
This morning the children's mother
pleaded with Judge Kean to allow her to
keep them. Hlie alleges that their father
is a bartender and a drunkard, and that
he has made her life miserable for years.
To-morrow her attorney will make a
formal request of the same kind, the court
takir.g no action to-day. Last month the
mother was married to a Mr. Dudley, a
recent arrival from San Francisco, and
has moved with him to iSeattie. She was
much affected to-day at the thought of
losing control of her children.

JOE MIDDLETON
FOUND GUILTY
Leader of Traver's Band
of Forty Thieves in
the Toils.
Played a Prominent Part in
the Sontag and Evans
Drama.
Supplied the Outlaws With Food
and Enabled Them to Elude
Their Pursuers.
FBEBNO, Cm.., May C. -Joe Middleton
was found guilty by a jury in Judge Ris
ley's court yesterday of the charge of
robbery, which lie committed in company
with lour others in holding up a number
of Portuguese who were encamped one
night near Wildflower, about two years
ago. Sentence will be passed on Monday
next at 10 o'clock.
Joe Middleton has a record which justly
entitles him to wear the stripes for a num
ber of years. It is known that he helped
Grat Dalton, when that notorious outlaw
escaped from the jail at Visaiia a number
of years ago and was eluding tne oflicers
in the Sierras. Midrilcton also played a
prominent part in aiding Chris Evans and
John Sontag, and afterward Evans and
Ed Morrell while they were fugitives in
the mountains. It was he, principally,
lhat kept the outlaws so thoroughly in
formed as to the movements of the otlkers
in pursuit.
The connection of the rean convicted
yesterday with the â¢'famous band of forty
thieves of Traver' 1 iaalso well known, and
it is with members cf this gang that he
committed the robbery of which he was
found guilty yesterday.
Middleton was one of the leaders of this
extensive gang of criminals, who were
scattered over Tnlare and Kings counties
and the southern part of Fresno. For
over two years they carried on their depre
dations of horse and cattle stealing and, in
fact, all kinds of thieving. So thoroughly
organized were they that, despite the most
vigorous efforts of the ollicers, it was a
long time before the criminals could be
brought to justice. About a year ago,
however, the authorities succeeded in
gaining sufficient evidence and began
making arrestÂ«. The leaders were all
convicted und sent to prison for long
terms.
B. E. Jeffords, one of the more notorious,
was sent up from this county.
When (irat Dal ton escaped from jail he
tied to the mountains and it is known
that Middleton kept him supplied with
food und information as to what the of
ficers were doing. He has always stoutly
denied that lie had any hand in the out
law's break from jail. It seems that Mid
dleton tinally played traitor to Dalton,
who picked up another desperate char
acter in tlie mountains named Dean for a
companion. Middleton disclosed their
hiding-place to ti.e ollicers and this re
sulted in the capture of Dean, Dalton
managing to escape. Middieton made his
home with a woman known as Mag
Rucker at her place in the foothills of
Tulare County. Evans and Sontag, as
well as P^vans and Morrell, made this one
of the places where they went to tiil their
haversacks and to learn the news of their
pursuers. In all the outlaws had fire
such places.
SLOCAN MINING DEAL.
Croup of Well-Paying Claims Bought by
a London Syndicate for Half a
Million Dollars.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 6.â One of the
largest sales ever made in the famed mo
can district was consummated yesterday
in this city when a London syndicate
purchased for $500,00u from A. E. Hum
phreys, J. D. Farrell and Captain M. I).
Moore, all of Spokane, and W. C. Yakeys
of Detroit, Mich., a group of mines com
posed of the Idaho, Alamo, Cumberland,
Concentrator and Tramway, located in
the immediate vicinity of Three Forks.
The mines are mainly silver producers,
and Mr. Humphreys stated this after
noon in confirming the report of the sale
that the Alamo and Idaho alone dad to
date paid $-'25,000 in dividends. Tne other
three mines are comparatively undevel
oped, but what little work has been done
i 9 said to have revealed very satisfactory
bodies of ore.
The purchasers, it appears, have bail
the mines bonded for several months, and
it is reported that they have options on a
number of other big properties in thw
blocun. Mr. Humphreys stated that he
had no knowledge as to the identity of the
individual members of the purchasing
syndicate, but that they seemed to have
unlimited capital.

A WHITE LIVER
Is the kind of a liver that mean
men are supposed to carry about.
A doctor will tell you that no one
can live with a white liver.
When the liver is at all disor-
dered you are sure to have melan-
' *â¢ ; choly fits and to wish to be alone. : :
You will have alf kinds of curi-
ous fancies and peculiar feelings.
If the disorder is only a functional
one the liver is easily restored to
its normal condition. If the dis-
order has its origin in the abuse
or dissipation of the man it is not
so easily controlled. Very few
family doctors pay much atten-
tion to nervous troubles. As a
result the man who is so afflicted
* will get no comfort if he consults
his family doctor. This being - . v
true, hundreds of men are com-
pelled to try other cures. As a
result the Hudyan remedy treat-
ment has been tried by many .
thousands, and these thousands
have been cured. Just 10,000
men say Hudyan cures. Do you
believe them? You can see their
statements in black and white.
It is a fact. Hudyan cures fail-
ing manhood, nervous debility,
neurasthenia and disorders of
man called private. You should
call on the Hudson doctors for
information about the Hudyan .

Day at Odds of

Favorites in the Bettim? First
on Four Different Oc
casions.
Eismore L:d Salabir Past the Wire.
Luc_7 Star Was Final'y
Given Hh H?ad
Old Logan, the iron horse, is slowly Dut
surely reaching the century mark in his
long string of hanl-earned victo r iÂ«s. The
old warrior of the turf, who is known
from one end of the country to the other
and is familiar with neariy every railroad
and racetrack in the land, will probably in
the near future have earned a well-deserved
vacation, for im owner, Alex Shields, has
been quoted as saying that when Logan
captuitd his one hundredth race the turf i
â would know him no more. The aged
racer was a 10 to 1 shot in the betting in
the final race of the day at Emeryville
and in a bard drive, ridden by Mike Ben
nessy, beat ilontallade out half a length
in 1:43.
The balance of the sport was marked by '
nothing out of the ordinary proove of '
affairs. Favorites were in much better ;
form, capturinc four of the six purses.
It was cutaway day with the Lucky \
Star folks in the opening five furlong
scramble and backed down from b to 3,
the Friar Tuck gelding led a!l the way, ]
making his field look like "yailer dogs." j
Chappie, the S to 5 favorite, finished sec- j
oiid, six or eight lengths away, with Roy i
Carruthers in the show. The winner's
time was 1:02.
Atkin & Lottridce annexed the next j
purse, with Adam Andrew. The distance
was six furlongs and the peldinz was a
pronounced 8 to 5 choice. Clawson j
could not keep him up the first part, but
when straightened for the wire he look
the lead and won handily two lengths
.ahead of Keel, a 20 to 1 shot, well ridden
tjy Stevens. Nervoso took third place in
i drive.
The tliird raje, over a mile, was taken
h'y the 9 to 5 choice Sea Spray, which led
from the start and won handily from Two
Cneers in I:43}^. Tom Eltnore came fast
at the md, securing the show.
Getting away next the rail to a flying
Start Elmsore, the 9 to 5 favorite, made a j
rvrhaway race of the two-year-old spin at
four and a half furlongs, leading the sec
ond choice. Salabar, past the judges a j
â¢length, in :55; Dousterswivel, resurrected, â¢
wns a good third.
Howard had nothing much to beat in
the fifth at six furlongs, decided under
veiling conditions, and coming out a 4 to
5 choice won ail the way, witl> Ricardo, a
10' to 1 choice, taking the place from Our
C'ijmate in a drive. The latter received a
rnUerabie ride at the hands of stable-boy i
Jenkins.

It looked r.s though Nnncomar should
have shown some sort of speed in the
opening dash. Snider got a half-Nelson
on him early in the game and never let
up until both shoulders touched the mat.
George had one siege of it on the ground,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1897.
A BUTTLE ROYAL
WILL SOON BE ON
California Cyclists Will
Fight the Wheelmen's
League.
Over Five Hundred Riders Al
ready in the New Organ
ization.
Ex-Cbief Consul Kerrigan May Tour
the Stateâ D.-fianc Sent Back
to the EaU.
________
The ganntlet thrown down by the Na
tional officers of the League of American
Wheelmen to the Caliiorn:a cyclists who
have seceded to form an organization of
thoir own has been taken up with a will,
and hereafter it is to be war â war to the
knife.
The many members of the California
Associated C3'ding Clubs, under whose
banner the seceders have ranged them
selves, who read the dispatches n yester
day morning's Call, are ready and willing
to begin the battle at cnce, and point with
EX-CHIEF CONSUL KERRIGANS Card of Membership in the
California Associated Cycling Clubs, Under Whose Eanner
500 Wheelmen Have Alread/ Ranged Themselves.
pride and confidence to the fact that sev
eral hundred men have already joined the
new organization as Individuals, and
pledged themselves to support it to Iho
utmost extent. They have no fear of the
reprisals that are threatened, or that the
secession movement will be disrupted by
anything that the Eastern people may do.
The aDpointment ct George H. Strong
as chief consul, to succeed Frank Kerri
gan, who resienei to become a member of
the California Associated Cycling Clubs,
does not worry tnem at all, because, while
they have much respect for Mr. Strone as
a veteran cycist and a man of sterling
character, they realized that he is far past
the prime of life and that he will not tave
the energy and strength to stem the tide
of discontent and secession that has taken
such a strong hoid on the rapidly failing
North California Division of the League.
Ex-Chief Consul Kerrigan has shown
his conlidence in the new organization by
joinine, and his card was handed him a
lew days ngo. He is outspoken in Ins be
lief and predictions that the California
Associate 1 Cycling Clubs will eventually
â ana in the near futureâ u?urp all the
functions and power of the division and
that it will open a new era for California
wheelmen.
"The new organization is bound to suc
ceed," said he, yesterday, "because we
have the strongest whpelmenin Caiilornia
in our ranks and our cause i 1 * just. Just
look at the proeress we have made. With
in thirty days over 500 wheelmen have
joined the associated clubs as individu
als, and several cluos in this City and
interior have sent in their applications.
"We will give Mr. Potter and the rest of
the league officials all the fight they want
if that is what they mean, and it would
appear from the dispatches that they
mean to down us if possible.
"If it becomes necessary I will take my
wheel this summer and put in my vaca
tion touring the State, talking secession
and the n*w organization. I can get a
dozsn men who are well known and good
talkers to do likewise, ariu I am sure this
will bring a great deai in me way of prac
tical results. They cannoi drive us out
of the field, and while we may not entirely
drive them out, we will certainly make
our organization the great power in Cali
fornia. We will run cycling matters to
suit local conditions and for the benefit of
California wheelmen and not lor the
pleasure of a few people in the E;ist who
do not understand or care much about us.
"It is probable that one of the early
steps will De 10 change the name of our
organization from tlie California Asscci
a'ed Clubs to Caiilornia Associated
Cyclists. This will keep the initials and
emblem the same and make the name
more comprehensive â show that it is an
organization of individuals as well as
clubs.
"George H. Strong, the new chief consul,
is a good man and bo ia Dwyer of Sucra
roento, the new vice-consul, but they will
have a hard time holding their disgruniled
and disconcerted forces together and we
will have half ot those who are left beforn
they get fairly to work.
'â¢The day of Eastern domination in Cali
fornia wheeling matters is past, and we
see the dawn of a new era."
A number of other cyclists, including
Caj. tain Day of the Bay City Wheelmen,
George P. Wetmore, one of trie "yeis/'anii
others expressed themselves in like terms.
CANCER KILLED HIM.
P. BlcGlllen Expired While on Hia Way
Home From the County
Hospital.
P. McGiilen of 1718 Leavenworth street
was taken sick on an Ellis-street car yes
terday afternoon after returning from a
visit to the City and County Hospital,
whither he had gone for treatment of an
oid case of cancer of the thrr>nt.
He wan taken from the car at the corner
of Van Ness avenue and O'Farrell street
and expired when ho reached the side
walk. He had been suffering for a loan
time with cancer of the throat, and that
disease was the cause of his death.
The deceased was a steam-fitier by occu
pation and was a married man, 50 years
old.
PAYMENT WAS EEHJSED.
Grocer A. H. Merten Was Made the Vic
tim of a Spurious (heck.
A. H. Merten, a grocer at Hyde and
O'Farrell streets, has complained to the
detectives about one H. Jeffery Tinling, a
piano-tuner, who, be ci;iims, defrauded
him out of $23. He states that TinJinj;
Dresented him with a check purporting to
be signed by R. J. Stewart of 1126 Hyde
Mreet, drawn on the An^lo-California
Hank. He received the coin in excuange,

Union.
She Does Not Believe in Bloom

nified in Hard Manual Labor
for a Woman.
Mrs. Isabella Martin returned from Oak
land yesterday weary after her first day's
struggle with tbe Painters' Union, whose
rates and methods she did not like.
"It struck me that I was being imposed
upon," she sa-d lost night as she sat at
her home on Van Ness avenue, "and I de
cided to put on short skirts and a woolen
sweater and do the work myself. I
painted live rooms to-day and 1 propose
to i aint my three cottages at Twenty-first
and West streets before I nm done. I
wear a Maxine Elliott hat to keep the sun
off and 1 rind the short skirts very con
venient. I do not believe a modest
woman would ever wear bloomers. They
are usly and offensive. If skirts will not
do she uueht to wear trousers richt out."
Mrs. Martin was also seen in Oakland
by a Call reporter yesterday and Â«he said
she intended to wortc from 8 a. m. until
6 p. m. dpilv.
"I shall finish the inside work soon,"
she said, "wiping the perspiration from
her forehead with a lace handkerchief;
rendolent with heliotrope in one hand,
while she dauDed paint with the other.
"I have painted tho panels beautifully,
and when ready for the outside I *hall ]

TROUBLE AMONG BARBERS.
A Member of the Fraternity Is Ac

Secretary I. Less of the Free Employ- i

the Journeymen Barbers' International i
Union of America No. 27, lias sworn to a !
complnint in Police Judge Campbell's
poart charging 8. Fuchs, a barber nt 325
Grant avenu I*,1 *, with conduciine an em

Leas claims that Fuchs represents him- i
self as a member of the Bnrbers' Associa- \
tion, and by virtue of ii is alleged position
induces postulants for membership to de- 'â 
posit with him a fee of 25 een's.
Les? says FuHis secures pmnloym<Â»n'i '
for these men, and after he lias charged |
them each frnm $1 to $11 for getting them j
a job the men lose their si i nations.
Clocks Still Stopped.
The clocks at the City Hall are still stopped,
and Supervisor Sheehan, chairman of the
Committee on Public Buildings, has decided
on a new plan of action. He has employed a
skilled clockmaker to make an attempt to
wind the timepieces, and if this effort is v.o.
successful will introduce a resolution in the
next mcettrp <:f the boara to have ihem re
placed with clocks that can be more easily un
derstood.

THE TARIFF.
Reports from Washington concerning the outlook for a speedy adoption of a tariff
bill are so confl cting it is difficult to arrive at any conclusion concerning them. We
are assured by some correspondents tbat a poll of the Senate shows that a majority
is in favor of adopting the bill as reported to that body, but others, who are equally
well informed, state that strong opposition will be made to it; that it will have to be
materially amended before it can pass even the Senate; and that after leaving that
body it will meet with strong opposition in the House.
The changes in the bill which have attracted most attention ars those omitting
from the revised report the clause referring to Hawaii and that dealing with the sub
ject of reciprocity generally. It is understood that the Republican members of the
Financa Committee who revised the bill are not opposed to the Hawatian treaty ncr
to the principle of reciprocity, bat have deemed it best to report the bill without
them in oruer that they may ba taken up separately and dealt with on their merits.
This programme is one of parliamentary tactics whicn we may fairly assume to
have been wisely adopted since the men who have taken it are in daily consultation
with Republican Senators and have a full understanding of the situation. They are
certain y better able to decide how sucn questions should be dealt with than are
critics who are remote from Washington and cannot know so well what are the forces
for and anainst either of the measures. It cannot be denied that the Hawaiian treaty
and the principle of reciprocity are each of them of sufficient importance to deserve
a separate treatment, and therefore nothing seems to be lost by the course which nas
been taken.'
In the conflict of reports and estimates from Washington the only thing of which
we can be at all certain is tbat the debate on the bill in the Senate ii likely to be a
very long one, and also that there may ha a great deal of opposition L) the House to
any bill which the Senate adopts. The measure is not yet out of the woods, and
many amendments may be made to it before it becomes law. The people of Califor
nia must, therefore, continue to be vigilant in lookinz after their interests.
We have seen tbat in the revision made by the Senate committee we gain some
thing by increased duties on citrus fruits, but lose something by the reduction of
duties on other fruits. It is now our fight to hold fast to what we have gained, and if
possible recover what we have lost. It ia going to be a difficult task to form a tariff
which will give such satisfaction as to become a permanent part of our commercial
policy, but when once the present bill is adopted Congress will not readily undertake
to change it for many years to come. We must fight, therefore, at this time for our
interests, since negligence may lead to inefficient protection for the rest of this
generation.
THE MISSION PARK.
The debate at the session of the im
provement clubs on the proposition to in
dorse ihe movement of the Mission Park
Association was sufficiently spirited to
show that t^e proposal has attracted pub
lic attention, roused popular interest and
that citizens have begun to consider it as
a practical enterprise deserving study
under ail its aspects. This in itself is an
encouraging sign. It was not be expected
that everybody would aeree on every de
tail of the proposed improvement, ana the
very force ot the opposition to some of
the plans is an evidence of the keenness
with which the subjsct is now being
thought over by intluential members of
the community.
It is worth noting that the opposition
and differences of opinion disclosed dur
ing the debate were not directed to the
general plan of providing parks and pleas
ure grounds lor the southern portion of
the City. That mucli was made clear by
'.he adoption of a motion which, without
indorsing any particular plan or any par
ticular site for a park, advocated the
establishment of p?rks in the Mis-ion dis
trict. It may be assumed therefore that
the policy of jroviding such a park has
public approval, and there are no differ
ences of oninion except upon compara
tively minor matters of detail.
Popuiar sentiment will not arrive at any
conclusion on the subject until some i
definite plun has been devised by the pro- ;
moters of the enterprise and estimates
made of the probable cost. It depends ;
wholly upon the nature of these plans :
whether ihe scheme will have sufficient
support to be carried through at any time
in ihe near future. The promoters, there
fore, had best direct their attention to a
careful consideration of these features of
their enterprise. Tney have public favor
with them on the general proposition,
and if they can show how either one large
park or a series of small parks connected
by boulevards can be arranged without
entailing too great a cost, or involving
any suggestion of a job, they will stand a ;
fair chance of succeeding in their desires
and winning for themselves the honor
and credit of being the directors of a great
public improvement and the promoters of I
the general welfare of the City.
IHE ARBITRATION TREATY.
The defeat of the arbitration treaty by
the Senate was not unforeseen. The gen
eral principle of arbitration has long been
supposed by the American people, and a
majority of them favor such a principle
to this day. It has been clear, however,
lor some time that they were not in favor
of a treaty which would bind them to a:bi
tration upon all questions which might
arise between them and Great Britain.
The defeat of ths bill, therefore, does not
signify opposition to that method of set
tling international disputes, but is only
proof that the people are not willing to
taKe a leap in the dark and a^ree to arbi
trate matters which nave not yet arisen.
In addition to the general objection to
an agreement to arbitrate issues not yet
clearly defined and which, in fact, cannot
yet be fores en, there was also a sp-cific
objection to several feature of the treaty
as arranged by fcecietary Olney. These
objectionable features were of such a radi
cal nature they could not be cured by
amendment, and although the treaty was
revised and materially altered in many
respects it was nevertheless regarded by
ttie Senators as dangerous to some of the
most important interests of the country
and therefore rejected.
Senator Carter very clearly expressed
the prevailing sentiment when tie said
there could be no doubt of the partiality
of the Government and the people of the
United States toward the settlement of
disi.utes by arbitration, and that for this
reason there never would be any difficulty
in securing an agreement to that end In
case oi any spec. tic dispute. Accordingly
it is not necessary for our people to tie
themselves by an agreement or uncertain
scope and purport, eapicia ly with a coun
try which has shown itself to be completely
out of sympathy with our interests and
opposed to many of our National aspira
tions.
Tie defeat of the treaty will not be re
garded as in any respect militating against
the settled policy of this country to arbi
trate ali international disputes, whether
with a great power or a weak one. We
are not an aggressive people. We are
willing to *ettle every controversy in ac
cordance with reason and justice. We
have rejected this treaty solely because
we are aware that any question which
arises can be very readily submitted to ar
bitration without such a treaty, whereas
if we had adopted it, we might be bound
in cases where it would be opposed to our
prestige and our dignity as a Nation to
leave the adjudication of tho controversy
to a foreign power.
It li reported that ex-Senator Cameron
recently told his successor, Boies Penrose,
that he ought to marry, as it would be
more in keeping with his position as a
Seaator, and it is added . that Penrose
promptly leplied witn true party loyalty:
"All right; bring on the woman. I will
marry anybody the State Central Com
mittee indorses." 'This is the com test
evidence we have yet bad of the discipline
of the Pennsylvania machine.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1897.
THE WAR ENDED.
The war between the Greeks and the
. Turk 3 is virtually at an end. The de
! cisive battle has been fought and won by
' the superior numbers of the Turkish
j army and the superior generalship of
Edhem Pasha. The Greeks have no
j longer any hope of opposing an effective
' resistance to the advance of the victorious
! hosts, and are ready to agreo to the ac
j ceptance of almost any terms which the
; powers may arrange.
The ending of the war by no means set
tles tLe problem of which it was the out
come. As a matter of fact the armed
struggle and ihe battles between the
Greeks and the Turks have formed only
an episode in a drama which has been
holding the attention of Europe for years
and seems now to be indefinitely pro
longed. Turkey will be allowed to reap
but little reward for the success of her
arms, and the Greeks will not be com
pelled to suffer much from their rashness
in undertaking to battle wi'h a superior
power against the counsel and warning!
of Europe.
When the war is formally ended and the
opposing armies have returned to their
homes, and the old, or possibly new,
boundary Jines have been drawn between
ttiem, the diplomacy of Europe will re
sume the problem of the Levant at al
most the exact point wliere it left off at
the outbreak of hostilities. Whether tho
successes of the Turks have to any extent
modified the views of statesmen remains
to be seen. It is extremely probable that
they may have greatiy changed the atti
tude of Turkey herself, and may render
the Sultan and bi 3 advisers more difficult
to deal with than they were before they
had tested the strength of their army and
proven their abilities as a lighting power.
If this should be so, the war, so far from
aiding the diplomatists in settling t!ie
difficult issues beiore them, will have the
opposite effect, and may yet have conse
quences whose influence will be felt for
years to come.
It can hardly bÂ« sad that the result has
teen a surprise to the world. The mo<t
ardent iriends of Greece did not expect
her to win unless the subject peoples of the
Balkan peninsula shoulu rise to aid her in
a common war against the Turk. The
Greeks themselves evidently expected this
assistance. The invasion of Turkish ter
ritory by the irregular troops before war
was actually declared and the advance
into Epirus immediately on the outbreak
of hostilities are evidences of the lact that
the Government at Athens counted on an
uprising of the subject peoples of those
provinces as soon as the Greek armies ap
peared and tifforded a force around which
the insurgents could rally. These hopes,
as we have seen, were disappointed, and
with the retirement of the Greek troops
from the Turkish frontier the last chance
of Grecian success was lost.
For the present the movement toward
the destruction of the Ottoman empire is
checked. The Turk has once more shown
Europe that he will fight lor his domin
ions to the last, and die sword in hand
with his face to the foe. This will d-lay
the independence cf the Balkan people
for a while, but nevertheless the move
ment toward that end will begin aeÂ«in.
For more than a hundred years the Turk
has been forced slowly backward from the
line of his .European empire when it was
at its greatest extfnt. Province after pio
vince hns been wrested away from the
Sultan, and the same forces which accom
plished so muc:i in the pa.-t will sooner or
later complete their task by the complete
overthrow of Moslem rule in Europe.
The end may be far off, but it is inevitable.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Hanford, the live county seat of Kings
County, ig preparing to celebrate to-morrow
the arrival of the San Francisco and San
Joiqutn Railroad. The town has v population
of something over 3UOO people, and is taking
on the nays of a substantial and enterprising
city. Thomas H. Van Frank, the electrician,
who has been there for several days pasi iv
connection with insla'.ling tne electric wiring
for the Brooks-Foil is Electric Company in the
new Courthouse, has returned to the City. He
snys rianiord is quite astir. Farmers through
out that section of the San Joaquin are rais
ing fields of fine grain, and orchards and vine
yards are laden with maturing fruit. He said:
" It Is difficu t to realize the impetus which
the Valley Road has given to business
throughout San Joaquin Valley until you make
a personal investigation. The road is gradta
through as far as Hftnlordin Kings County, and
in a lew days the depot at that point will be
near ing completion.
"The roaa will probably bo open for traffic
as tar as Hanford early In the summer.
"Kings County, while one of the youngest
In the State, is making great strides in the
right direction. The rublic buildings at Han
ford present nn unusually attractive appear
ance, tho now fire-proof Courthouse being an
especially (ommodious and beautiful build
ing. Tnrough the courtesy of Mr. H. G.
Lacey, the owner of tho lighting plant at
Hanford, we were afford d au opportunity of
visiting many of the banner ranches of the
county.
"There is an air of thrift and prosperity about
these placet, but nowhere is it more in evi
dence than at the celebrated Lucerne vine
yard, the property of San Francisco capitalists.
The largest ralsin-grape vineyard in the
worldâ for over 1000 acres are under Cultiva
t'.onârepresenting, as It does, the outlay 01 a
fortune, it Is indeed a monument to the busi
ness sagacity of its owners and to the wise
management of the superintendent, Mr. Louis
Chittenden.
"Preparations are being made for a grand
ball on toe evening ol May 9 to celebrate the
advent of the Valley road. It will be like a
scene from fairyland; thousands of gayiy
co;ored lanterns decorate the lawns and drives
while the spacious ranch buildings are being
redecorated in honor of the event. A thousand
invitations will bring an equal number of
guests, and the ball promises to go down in
the history of Kings County as the most mag
nificent entertainment ever given in the San
Joiiijuiu Valley."

A HISTORIC NEWSPAPER.
There are two copies of the Boston Gazette dated March 12, 1770, still extant. One is In
the Smithsonian Institution, the other is an heirloom in a California family.
Uncommon Interest would attach to the mere fact that a copy of a paper printed so long
ago was still intact and readable to a generation of this ago.
Of the millions of human beings who swarmed the earth when the Boston Gazetto of
March 12, 1770, appeared fresh from the printing press not one Is livine to-day. It if a verit
able news record from the grave. But this Is not Its most remarkrfble significance.
On the 12th ol March, 127 years ago, the Boston Gazette, which was a weekly publication,
printed its first news report of the Boston messacre, which had occurred a few days before.
In picking up this paper now, over a century later, the awed beholder experiences a vague
feel ing of nearness to that bloody deed which it so sharply and vividly portrays as though it
were an occurrence of yesterday.
The reading of the ancient sheet, with all its allusions to a present time and not to a dim
past, weaves an environment around one's mentality that is not at all of the nineteenth cen
tury.
A Call writer was detailed to investigate the report that this remarkable relic was in ex
istence oniy a few miles away, and the result of his exploration nas brought to light the pap-r

National Populist Committee Troubles.
Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: It is now well known that if all the Popnli3ts from
Maine to California had voted solidly for Blyr.ll he would have been elected by a larger ir.a
ority than McKinley polled. And yet the "fusion" candidate came "perilously" near being
elected. The advocates ol "fusion" now confidently believe that they can carry the next elec
tion for the Presidential candidate if the '-middle-of-the-road" or straight Populists can be
held in line and induced to support a fusion candidate.
In the meantime the straight Populists are organizing a powerful opposition to any such
"union of forces" as compelled them to accept Bryan, the free silver Democratic candidate
last year, and a large majority of the Populist newspapers, organized as the Reform Press
Association, openly and earnestly oppose any form of fusion and denounce and repudiate their
Natlonnl chairman, Senator Duller of North Carolina, as the ally of Senator Stewiirt and other
silver Republicans and Bryan Democrats, nud demand his resicnatiOD, because he lias refused
to call the National Committee together 10 define the situation.
A committee of these reform press editors haÂ« just issued a call for a National Delegate
Conference to meet in Memphis, Term., July 4, 1897, to do what the National chairman de
c.ined to have the National Committee doâ to declare for an independent policy, in order to
consolidate the party In opposition to fusion. This has created intense feeling at Wasninpton
among the office-lioiding Populists, nearly every one of whom secured his election as Senator
or Congressman through fuÂ«ion. Senator Butler, himselt, gained his seat in the United Slates
Senate by fusion witn the Republicans of Nortn Carolina, and Senator Allen of Nebiaska
gained his sent by fusion with Democrats in his State; and so it is wltn nearly all of them.
The first move of Chairman Butler and other office-holding Populists in Washington, to
head iff the proposed Memphis conference, was to hold "a joint caucus of Senators and Repre
! sentatives," and a "Washington letter" was prepared by tins caucus and Â«ent out over the
I country, one copy being sent by Senator Duller personally to ex-Senator l\ffer, now the editor
of the Top'-'ka (Kans. ) Advocate. Mr. Pefler published the last paragraph with scathing com
ments. The paragraph makes the charge that "it has been learned thÂ«t some emisartes of the
middle-of-the-road combine have been in Washington on the quiet. They have not consulted
with Populist Semtors and Congressmen, but it :Â» rumored that they have been consulting
with oerlnin Republicans."
"Dear Populist reader," says Mr. Peffer, "did you ever read a more insinuating, close
mouthed, underhanded and scurrilous attack on any person or body ? It has been learned"
[Hy whom?] "that some emissaries" [Some what? Who ai-d what is an emissary ?] "of the
middle-of-the-road combine" [What sort of a combine is this ? Who compose it, and tor whit
purpose is it forpied ?] "on the quiet." What does that mean ? All there is of this is rumor,
and yet it goes out in the letter of Â« Senator of Ihe United Stales, written in a Senate com
mittee-room on committee letter-head paper.
The Advocate does not know that there is any middle-of-the-road combine, but it thinks
there ought to be one if for no other reason than to < ffset the work of the Congressional com
bine. !or this combine is assuming dictatorial and despotic powers, etc.
Well-iniormed readers who uuderatand politics need not be told by me that there is mat ter
in this Populist ouibrenk of importance to "the Nation, for if it prevents fusiou of the reform
forces the triumph of the straight Populists means much to the country, which I mÂ«v poiut
out hereafter. Joseph asbury Johnson.

FRATERNAL DEPARTMENT.
The Twentieth Anutvertary of Morse
.Lodge No. 257 of the Independent
Order of Odd Fellows.
Memorial Hall In the O3d Fellows' building
was crowded to its fullest capacity last
Wednesday ni?ht by the friends of Morpe
Lodge No. 257, who had assembled on invi
tation to enjoy the programme that had been
prepared in honor of the occasion by the anni
versary committeeâ Joseph J. Richards, P. G.
(Chairman), Past Grand J. Sampson, J. M. Wil
son, H. Spellman, C. Brind, A. Stevens and E.
Lc-'poM.
The progrnmme was an unusually Inter
esting ooe and of more than ordinary length.
After a few words of welcome by Dr. Carieson,
the noble grand, those who took part came on
the platform without tho formal announce
men t so usual in affairs of this charÂ«cterâ "Our
next number will be a vocal solo," etc. The
Golden Gate orchestra gave as an overture the
"Double Eaele March"; Master George Kich
ardÂ«, it lftd if 12, gave selections on the vio.ln
which gave proof that he Is on the road that
lead:) u> the niche that professional violinists
seek to reach; two little girls, Carrie and MU
lie Adolph, sang songs suited to juvenile
voices, and then followed a good sketch en
titled "Musical Tramps," in which Messrs.
liathweli aud Talsen gave a numDer of 1m ita
tions and some good music on various instru
ments.
Miss Bessiit Savannah gave two recitations,
and her delivery and action were far above the
class of r. cuera who volunteer at fraternal
entertainments. One of the gems of the even
ing was a violin solo, a selection from "Rlgo
letto," with Mussard's Mazourka n8 an encore.
Tniswas by Master Benedict Smith, a youth
of 16, who Is now a pupil of Mine. Camilla
Unso. 111! performance gave evidence of a i
high order of ability. Ills playing is such
that it has a.tracted the attention of many of
the leading critics', who have spoken in the
highest praise, and if he continues in the en
thusiasm that now possesses him he will be
come another bright star In the constellation
of brilliant musical geniuses that California
i has proiucea.
Another attractive feature was the presenta
tion of classic scenes by Me.-srs. Kenneth, Me-
I.cod and Edward Burrows. The first was the
quarrel scene from "Julius Cse'Hr," in which
the first named look the part of Brutui and
the last named that of Cassius. Mr. McLeoo,
who has for some time past been studying far
thestHge, displayed evidence of caretul study
of the part he assumed. lie has a good stage
presence, but delivery that needs a little lorce
to make it more effective. Iv the second se
lection, in which ho aÂ«sumed the part of Vlr
frinius in the scene where the Roman father
seeks his daughter, he gave further evidence
of strong dramatic talent, which, being devol
oped, nill, with a careful study of those wno
follow in lie line of the legitimate and with
encouragement, place him in the lineof ad
vancement In the profession be has chosen.
Then were given thÂ« lollowitiK nunibe-s:
Mandolin soo, Miss MiÂ»y Tiffany, Mrs. L. Kel
sev accompanist; \V. H. Taisen, who told a
few of his jokes; Harry Aaolph ployed popu
lar airs on lead pencl.s, tin whiÃtles Â«nd on a
piece of rubber hcne; T. H. Klltro recited "The
Old Act- r's Story"; MissN'eille McMullln gave
vocal selections, and the programme closed
with character impersonations by Louis Hess,
all of which were well received. Atter the pro
gramme there was a collation for ail who
wlshtd to partake. The evening was a most
enjoyable one, which will be remembered
with pleasure by all who attended. . Chairman
Richards was a busy man attending to the
comforts of the gues'.s and seeing that the
talent came on in turn without delay, but he
proved equal to the occasion, y â .'.,â >

NOTARIAL BLANKS
STILL THE THEME
It Was Another Quiet Day
for the Fair-Craven
Case.
The Attorneys Still Fencing
Over the Admissibility
of Evidecc\
Witness Stanford at Last Leaves th
Stand, but Only to Be Succeeded
by More Crock r Employes.
Until the attorneys for the fair estate
executors either succeed in or abandon
their efforts to place before the court and
jury a line of evidence that has in the past
two days been repeatedly ruled to be inad
missible the proceedings in tne suit to test
the validity of Mrs. Nettie Craven's deeds
are not destined to interest to any start
ling degree the general public.
Yesterday's session, like that of the pre
vious day, was taken up by another duel
i between those masters of legal lore, D. M.
Delmas and Garret McEuerney, over these
Crocker notarial blanks. The latter gen
-1 tleraan was as persistent aa ever in hs
attempts to lay a foundation for the intro
duction of evidence which he claims will
tend 10 show that Notary Cooney's ac-
Knowledgmentj of Mrs. Craven's deeds in
ISO 4 were executed on blanks printed over
;t year later, and Mr. Delnias tc-n'.ed 10
be as successful as ever in parrying off
these thrusts and in worrying the oppos
ing side almost into a state of exaspera
tion.
William E. Stanford, the leeal-blank
clerk of the H. 8. Crocker Company sta- j
tionery and printing establishment, was
again on the witness-stand when Judge |
Black opened cour; in the morning. Stan
ford started off by askme permi-sion to â¢
correct a statement he made yesterday
afternoon. On that occasion he said he
was. not positive his employer, C. H. I
Crocker, haa seen the blanks which were .
produced in court. What he wished to I
say now was that he was sure Mr. Crocker
had seen the blanks.
In answer to Mr. McEnerney's ques
lions Stanford said he coi'ld easilj* .den
j tifv one of Crocker's not* ial blanks of
the issue of January 8, IS m>, because of a
defective letter "o" that appeared thereon, j
Mr. McEnerney then returnt'd to his !
old effort lo get one of the blanks in cvi- !
dente, bu* met with the objection that I
had bloiksd him for two days. Mr. Del- !
mas asserted that, unless it were shown i
j lhat the original blank which Mr. Crocker
had in>.r>ected cou.d be shown to have been
i lost or destroyed, Stantord's te-tlruony
| was not of value in helping the copy into j
| evidence. In mis he waÂ« once more mis- [
I tamed by the court. Then Mr. Delmas i
; became lenient to the oiner side, and said j
if they only wanted ;o show there wa< a |
i defective letter in the sample blank shown
: iv court he would not object.
1 lie attorneys ior the plaintiffs heaved ;
: sighs of relief at this, and the sample was |
hinaed to the jury.
The loophole was not so wide as It i
looked, however, for whfii Mr. McEnerney I
! sought to have Stanford ?ay that the cie- ;
! fects in the sample were tho same as 'hose |
Mr. Crocker had called attention tv, he '
encountered another objection anrt was
unable to get over it. Tnen he gave up i
I tr>ing iorawhili' a r ul Mr. Delmas suo- !
! jectea Stanfora to another cross-examina- ;
1 tion.
He showed by referring to the young
blank clerk's evidence 111 the Cooney ex
amination that he was not telling the
!Â»ame story now. Staniord's explanation
of this was that his memory was at fault.
He said, however, that he thought hi*
previous testimony was more rehaole than
that he was giving.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Attorney Delmas handed to Stanford what
to all appearances was a notarial blank
emanating from the H. S. Crocker Com
pany establishment. Stanford was ad
WORKING TO RELIEVE THE STARVING.
The Rev. Dr. Richard Gear Hobbs of Jacksonville, 111., who, as tola in The Call yesterday,
has arrived hero to load the whalebnck City of Everett with corn for the starving people of
India, met and conferred with the local committee yesterday. The good work of Mr. Hobbs is
attracting much attention among those whobe sympathies are aroused by the pitiful condi
tion ot those iar-:.wny black people. They are going to do all they can to help them.
Train after train of curs of corn will arrive here till 25U0 tons are brought here from lowa,
Nebraska and other States mid landed at Mr. McXcar's big warehouse p.t l'ort Costa, from
which it will be transferred, af;er sacking, to the ship. Mr. McNear will charge no storage for
the corn, so Dr. Hobbs snys, and es for the jute bags into which it ia to be put, they are to be
furnished at the bare cost.
Dr. Hobbs is secretary of the Illinois Conference of the M. E. church. He is going to India
with the corn. It will tie unloaded at Calcutta, which is the place lrom which the corn can
best be distributed to the suffering people. The ship will contain 500 tons more of corn than
is coming from the prairie Slates, and Dr. Hobbs hopes California will contribute that much.
Di. Hobbs snia last night: "It Is now hoped that tne ship will b-- ready to .sail from here
about the 25th inst. The cargo is in transit, so far as that part which comes .'ram east of the
mountains is concerned. It consists of 2500 tons of corn. It has been suggested that as the
ship can carry 3000 tons, It wouM bo a good thing for the people of <nlifornia to contribute
500 tons of wheat and thus complete the cargo. No space should be lost in a ship going on so
merciful an errand. The corn is a ctiean, rnuph food, better than the people are used to, but
the wheat would prove a doubly welcome Rift. Dr. Louis KioDSCh of the Christian Herald.
New York, guarantees tue cominir forwarJ of the corn. When are the people in California to
add the one-sixth of the cars;o which is lucking?
"The going of this ship aud the others which are to sail from Now Yorlc will make this re
lief movement the greatest international charity of history. It is safe to predict that the peo
ple of tne Pacific CoaÂ«t will wish to have a part in it."
Any who are willing to co-upcrate in the matter can communicate with Rev. Dr- B. G.
Hobbs, Uie Christian Herald commissioner, wUo is at tho Occidental Llolol.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1897.
vised to scrutinize it closely and then tell,
if he could, when it was printed. This
was too much for the witness, despite his
twe.ve years of daily handling of these
blanks.
"Can you tell if it was printed by the H.
S. Crocker Company at all?"
'"Not for a certainty," replied Stanford.
"As a matter of fact you cannot tell
anything about it â is not that right?"
"Yes."
In answer to further questions Stanford
admitted he was very friendly with Charles
J. Hejrcerty, one of the attorneys for tl<e
plaintiffs. Mr. Hegjterty had been coun
sel for the witness' wife for some live
years.
A few more unimportant questions were
asked hy both sides and then Stanford
was at last excused from his long siege on
t lie stand. He lost no time in getting out,
as was demonstrated a moment later
when Mr. McEnerney discovered he had
another qaestion to ask him. The bailiffs
shot out in the wake of t tie fleeting wit
ness, but no trace of him could be found.
Superior Judge Carroll Cook now took
the stand for the purpose of formally
identifying the exhibits used in the
Cooney examination and needed in the
present trial.
Geoge yon Ann, who has charge of the
work of printing all legal blanks in the
Crocker establishment, was called for the
purpose of identifying a proof of the all
important notarial blank. Yon Aim was
hardly a satisfactory witness in this re
gard, for ahhoueh he said the paper
shown him looked like the original proof
still he could not swear it was the identi
cal one. Mr. JJcEnerney asked the ques
tion over and over agam in various forms,
but it was all of no avail, as Yon Ahn
would not swear positively that the paper
was the orijinal proof.
Then in response to another line of
questions Yon Ahn said he remembered
having received nn order from Mr. Stan
ford to get out 10.000cop.es of the Crocker
general acknowledgment blank, and re
membered setting "up the type for it.
After that the "forms" went out of his
nandÂ«, having passed to the pressman.
The wi:nof.s was shown the order alleged
to have been de ivered by Stanford, but
again he was found wanting in positive
ness. The paper looked like the original,
but he woul'l not swear that it was.
James T. Whiteside was the next wit
ness called. Ho testilied that lie was
formerly an employe of the H. S. Crocker
Coni|>any. In August, 189 ft, he had charge
of the salesroom of the le^al blank de
partment, and recollected :he fact that on
the 7th oi that month he ordered from the
printing department 6000 acknowiedc
ment blanks, the iÂ»hraÂ»eolopy of which
differed from those of any other form that
had been printed by that establishment.
Then Mr. McE;i*rney offered to intro
duce one o! these 1886 blanks in evidence
and was doing so when court adjourned
until this morning.

perhaps you have never seen

The reasons are:
(1) you insist that your
grocer should sell you extract
at watery prices ;
(2) you don't know what
extract can be
(3) your grocer doesn't
quite dare ask you to pay more
for extracts ;
(4) last but not least, your
grocer makes more money on
the watery sort, and sells 'it to

WAR AMONG THE
BREWERY OWNERS
A Row in the Association
Causes a Cut in
Prices.
One of the i.e^bers Was Read
Out and Another Has
Resigned.
The Union Workmen Claim a Great
Victory After a Struggle of
Five Years.
The local brewers are on the verge of a
beer war. In fact the preliminary fight
ing has already begun and the members
of the Brewers' Protective Association
are very apprehensive of serious results
before peace s-hail be restored azain.
A little red label is the cause ol all the
trouble, because the lsbel is the emblem
of the United Brewery Workers' Union of
San Francisco. The Enterprise Brewery
insisted upon its right to place these red
strips of paper on all its barrels, indi
cating that it was fr:endly to organized
labor.
The story of this trouble really dates
back nearly live years to the time of the
great brewery worKers' strike.
Tue breweries felt the force of the big
strike, and the first to yield was Ulricb
Kemensperger of the Enterprise brewery.
From thai time his product was in demand
among all workman. This success caused
liirn to go a step further, and he placed
upon all his barrels the union's red label.
Before doing so, however, he notified
Kudoiph Mohr, secretary of tlie Breweis'
Association, and the employers' organiza
tion of his intention. Tiiis raised a merry
row in the association, which decid-ed to
line the member at the rate of $10 per
barrel for every package on which tne rea
label was found.
A detective was sant out to keep "tab.
on the red-labeled barrels, and in about
four days the tines amounted to nearly
$3SOO. At;aui Kemensper-er was notified to
quit usin<z the label, but upon the advice
of his attorney the brewer notiiiei the
association to quit fining him, claiming
that lie had resigned from the association.
It seems that his resignation was laid
on the table and never accepted. Right
here was a inker that all knew existed in
the pack. Kernensperger' e membership
deposit in the association amounts to
neurly $4000, and the a-soc;ation kept on
piiing tin tae fines until they more than
equaled this amount, and still would not
accept his resignation.
Matters we:e further complicated by
another transaction. It seems that
whi;e the Enterprise man was still in
good grace he borrowed $3000 from the
association for which he gave his note.
This was indorsed by J. C. Bauer, a bop
merchant, also a member of tlie associa
tion. Aftsr the trouble began Bauer was
called upon to pay up the note he had in
dorsed, ana from what can be learned he
was willing to do so. The attorney for
Remens-perger stepped in anil notified
Bauer that if he did ?o he would do so on
his own responsibility.
The association couid not begin a law
suit against, one of its own members, so to
get around this the association expelled
the hop merchant for no*, paying money
due to the association. Tfle next chapter
of this interesting tangle will probably be
told in court.
Meanwhile the entire brewing fraternity
is suffering. The old agreed price for
steam be^r'was $5 a barrel net or $5 50 and
the driver allowed to spend 50 cents on
each delivery. One of the brewers stated
last night that there is now no fixed price
on beer. Offers nre made at $4 aud some
say as low au $3 7o per barrel.
UNIONS IN THE SOUTH.
Secretary Joseph Walters Intro-
duces the Red Labsl In San
Dleero City.
Joseph Walters, secretary of the United
Brewery Workmen's Union, has just re
turned from San Diego and Los Angeles,
where he has recently been laboring in
the interests of union-made beer and the
cause of the red label. He reports having
met, with great success, especially in San
Diego, where he organized a strong brew
ery wortmen's union.
At Los Angeles the Council ot Trade
took up the work and made arrangements
for organizing the brewery workmen into
a union. Walters â¢ says that while there
are several breweries in that city, the
unions do not expect much opposition to
the label. .

requesting the Board of Supervisors to
transfer the $3000 usually spent for the
Fourth of Juiy celebration to the unem
ployed fund this year, provided it could
be legally done. The members of the
board were impressed with tne fact that
the money this year could be best used in
alleviating the distress existing arr.onj* tha
unemployed of the City. It was there
fore decided to ask that the amount be
turned over to the committee now in
charge of the fund for the relief of the
unemployed.
The annual meeting of the association
trill take place at the Academy of Sciences
Hall onTnursday evening, May 20. Be
sides the election of a new board of di
rectors and the report of the present
board, it was decided to have a dis
cussion upon ttie proposed College of
Commerce as a department of the Univer
sity of California. Hon. Arthur Rodger.-i,
being the author of the trojeci ol the
board of regents, ha-< been invited to ad

dent Watkins of the City board of Trade

cussion. It has aibo been decided to in

is expected that the debate will prove a
most interesting treat to all woo attend.
The sutject of tiie better lighting of the
Ciiy by electricity will also be discussed
at the meeting, and if possible some prac
ticable plan will be devised through which
the City will be adequately illuminated.

Guiseppi Campi thinks he has a good
cause ot complaint against his wife Maria
and wants a legal separation. He says
that she left him af;er living with him
ten days and that though she relused to
let him kiss her she permitted other men
to kiss her in his presence. This, he de
clares, caused him great unhappiness and
inspired a desire to be sei free from the
palling bonds of matrimony.

Mayor Phelan is considering two viola
tions of the law that he will call to the

formality of petting permission from the
City, and he desires the matter inquired
into.
He will al?o band in a messaee on the
completion of show-windows enchroach

WRECKED NEAR SAMOA.
An Unknown Vessel From California
or Oregon Loaded With
Lumber,
Collector Wise received a letter yester
day telling of the wreck of some unknown
vessel loaded with lumber from California
or Oregon. The letter is as follows:
Iva Savaii, Samoa, March 7, 1897.
There has been a quantity of timber, oxl2,
9x9, etc., floating through this group for ibe
last threu weeks, coming from the eastward,
which has evidently f. rmed part of a enrco
from California as the wood is all Oregon pine
by its appearance. It has been iv the water
about eignt weeks, as the worms fire just
starting to get into it and it takes about that
time for them to make a start on it here. One
piece of 9x9 I examined was branded 888 in
stencil 0:1 the end. if this serves to help you
trace any ruissirg ship I would be glad to
know what vessel it was from.
The natives also report having seen a large
mast broken and drifting at sea.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1897,
HER FIFTIETH
ROUND VOYAGE
The Alameda Has Made
That Many Trips to
Sydney.
Still as Stanch and True as
When She Left Cramps'
Shipyard.
Murderer Butler Was Rapidly Break
ing D.wa- Purser Sutton in
Trouble.
The Alameda â the crack vessel of the
Oceanic Steamship Company's line â ar
rived in port at an early hour yesterday.
Her record now shows twenty-five con
secutive round trips to Honolulu and fifty
round trips to Sydney, N. S. W. During
her fourteen years of service the vessel
has never been laid up for repairs and on
only one or two occasions was she ever
behind time.
From the time the vessel left ths
Cramps' yards in 1883 she has never been
laid up for a day, and Chief Enginsertrti
tle is confident she is good for another ten
year?. Coming in ahead of time yester
day morning the Rood ship looked like a
vessel just from ihe slips. For an "old
timer" the Aiameda's record of 358 knots
for one day's steaming between Auckland
and Apia is something that any of the
China steamers might be proud of. Yeir
in and year out the Alameda has held her
own.
Only three of the old-timers came in on
the Alomeda yesterday. They were: A.
D. Little, chief engineer; J. B. Duttou,
purser, and 0. N. Clark, chief stew
ard. Sutton severed his connection with
tbecompany as soon as the vessel docked,
but Little is still to be found at the old
quarters.
Captain Van Oterendorp has ouly
recently taken charge of the Ala
meda and Chief Officer Dowdell is
also a new man on the steamer.
Purser Sutton has made up his
mind to retire from the steamship busi
ness, and now, after his fiftieth round trip
on the Alameda, he will give up the sea.
Captain Van Oteriindorp, Chief Engineer
Lttle, Chief Officer Dowdell and Chief
Steward Clark will remain with the crack
liner.

Butler was the star boarder on the Mari
posa. A private letter from Apia, Samoa,
says:
Just a few lines, to say that we have got this
far with Butier all O. K. Since last writing (it
Honolulu he has not shown any ugilness. The
weather i 9 very hoi and to cool his room they
put a wlndsait through the porthole. He eats
three meals a day and has a great liking lor
icecream and sweet stuff.
This week Mageie Moore, the actress, looked
in and he recognized her. In aa instant he
asked her to sing a song that he had beard her
sing yi-iu- ago in Australia. It took her a long
time to thiuk of it, but she did t-inp it at lest,
and he thanked her kindly and said be knew
he did not have long to live.
He also n :.i to Mcllnt tie that his father hnd
gone mad aud that he was likely to do the
Rttnie. Hi- dots not want to go to the upper
deck for exercise, as he does not want to be
â¢stareu at.
Another correspondent says :
Our mnn Butler has been no trouble bb yet,
but Mr. Mcllatiio cays he is getting rattier
shaky the nearer we get to Sydney. He says
if he tins to hang tie will die the biggest crim
inal the world has ever heard of. Tney think
when he is sure that tiie end has come ne will
confess to a lot of murders that are not jet
known.
Purser Button of the Alamedn was ar
rested in Honolulu and was fined $250 for
hnving opium in his possession. The fol
lowing account is from a Honolulu paper:
About 11 o'clock this morninit on the corner
of Ho;el and Nuuanu streets Special Officer
Cordes lapped J. B. Sutton, tiurser of ihe
steamship Alamedn, on the shoulder and told
him to consider himself undsr arre*l for hav
ing opium in his possession.
"IJdw do you know i have got any opium?"
asked the purser.
"I can see it sticking out from your trou
sers." replied the officer.
In h:s pockets were found seven half
pound tins of opium. Mr. Button was locked
up on a clmrgeof having opium in his pos
session, In the meantime seudiug for his at
torney, Paul Neumann.
Sution was tried in the Police Court at 2:30
p. m. and found not euilty of importing opium.
He then pleaded guilty cf having opium iuhis
possession and was fined $250.
Mr. Sutton declared on his arrival here
that his arrest was all a mistake. "I was
told by a friend that I was in a position
to do a great favor for him. The man
told me that his house had been watched
by revenue officials and that be had some
opium in it that he would have to remove
unless he wished to get into serious
trouble.
"I agreed to help him and was re
moving the drug to a place of safety when
the officers arrested me. lam not guilty
of smuggling and to prove to you that
people on board the steamer believe me
innocent the passengers on the Alameda
raised a pnrse of $250, which they pre
sented to use with a testimonial."
MORTGAGES AND TRUST DEEDS.
Their Comparative Merits Discussed by
the league of Loin Association*.
A joint meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California League of Mutual
Benefit and Loan Associations and of at
torneys for Building and Loan Associa
tions convened yesterday afternoon in the
Mills building, for the purpose of consider
ing the adv sability of accepting trust
deeds as security for future lopns in lien of
mortgagee, as authorized by nn act of the
recent Legislature of this State.
The advantages and disadvantages of
so doing were discussed at some length,
when Attorney R'xford drew to the at
tention of those present that a case is
now before the Supreme Court involving
the validity of trust deeds, which will
probably not be decided before autumn,
and statod that in his opinion any action
taken might be rendered nugatory by an
adverse decision.
On the other hand, A. Sbarboro thought
a form oi tru>-t deed could be drafted for
use by all the associations, and that any
litigatou pending the decision would
be decided in favor of the holder by the
lower courts. If the decision of" the
Supreme Court were adverse, then it would
be time to take no more of them.
Another discussion culminated in the
appointing of a committee, with instruc
tions to be prepared with a form of trust
deed suitable ior the use of all associa
tions throughout the State, to be recom
memled in case the Supreme Court shall
render a decision favorable f .o their use.
Tbe committee is composed of President
Frank Otis, Attorneys D. Friedenrich,
J. B. Richardson and A. E. Bolton, Albert
Meyer and A. Sbarboro.
The committee was also authorized to
investigate the subject as to whether the
recent law extending the period of re
demption in mortgages applies to mort
gages in force before the passage of the
act.
ITS PIEST CONDUIT.

DELEGATES TO THE
PRESS LEAGUE
C. M. Shortridge and R. A.
Crothers Elected Frcm
This City.
The San Franc sea Press Cub
Soon to Move Into Eiegaat
New Rooms.
A Thorough Remodeling of the Con
stitutionâl crease of Valuable
Eooks and Pictures.
The reeular quarterly meeting of the
San Francisco Press Club occurred last
night. Delegates were elected to attend
the forthcoming meeting of the League of
Press Clubs, and several other matters of
importance were considered, among them
new clubrooma.
There was a large attendance of repre
sentative newspaper men, besides asso
ciate members, and the session was
unusually interesting. The constitution,
which has been found inadequate to the
demands of the club, partly because of
the very considerable increase of mem
bers, was amended and added to, while
certain sections were repealed altogether.
In some instances the constitution ana
by-laws had been found to conflict. By
the reconstruction of the two, they were
made to harmonize and fit the present
wants oi the club. The constitution and
by-laws will now be printed anew.
The report of the financial secretary
showed the club in an exce.'lent financial
condition, notwithstanding the hard times.
The organization has well on to $1000 in
bank. The reports of the recording sec
retary, librarian and other officers showed
that a great many books, pictures and
other desirable thing) had been added to
the rooms.
Paul Cowles of tho committee on new
clubrooms reported that elegant quarters
had been t fferod the club on the eighth
floor of the proposed Behlow building on
Geary street, opposite Union square, for
$250 a month, including lirht and heat.
Besides this a preffer had been made by
the owner of the building occupied by
Thomas Day & Co., Suiter stre?t, offering
a large part of the first floor above the
street for $150 a month or the top floor
for $200 a month. The building was to be
thoroughly modernized. Neither offer in
cluded lijiht or heat. The committee was
continued, no decision being reached.
The International League of Press Clubs
will meet in New York June 1, and the
San Francisco Press Club being allowed
two delegates took up the election of dele
gates. F. C. Roberts, one of the vice
presidents of the International League,
told of the desire of the organization that
only thorough newspaper men be sent.
After a petty discussion of the ob
jects of the lorthcorrtinK meeting C. M.
SaorUidge, proprietor of The Call, and

FROM THE SOUTH SEAS.
Lloyd o: bourne Arrives Frcm
Samoa and Tells of Its
Excitements.
Lloyd Osbourne, American Vice-Consul
General at Apia, Samoa, and siep
son of the late Robert Louis Ste
venson, arrived at this City on the
steamer Alameda yesterday morninp.
Mr. Osbourne is accompanied by his
wife and baby boy. The latter caused the
enaction of an unusual scene aboard the
ship just half way between the sunny isl
ands ol the South Seas and tbe equator.
The voucgsier was christened by Frede
rick Wallis, BiÂ«hop of Wellington, and
will bear through this life the name of
Alan.
Mr. Osbourne's visit to America is not an
official one. He will co to Monterey iv a
few days and from there to Lake Tahoe.
"Now that the hnrricane season is over,"
said Mr. Osbonrne, "the foreign men
of-war are beginning to arriva. A Ger
man cruiser anchored off Apia a few days
before we left tbe island. The experience
of a few years ago remains fresh in the
minils ot those who handle the navies of
the world.
In consequence, during the season
when the winds lash the sea into moun
tains of seething, leaping foam, the har
bor is deserted "as the space that sur
rounds the pole in the frozen north."

LOUIS CAHEN & SON,
Who'esale Dealers,
4i6-4iB Sacramento St,
road, called the attention of the oarsmen
to the fact that if a regatta were held in
the vicinity of El Campo the railroad
company would Hssist in every paiticular
to make it a success.
William Humphry, who 5s president of
the Pacific Athietic Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union, was present,
and at the request of the chair he en
lightened t c oarsmen present by giving
them a very clear and open s;atement as
to the definition o"f an amateur. He sail
regarding the registration rule tQat it was
an excellent scheme to protect amateur
sport of all kinds. By registration, which
meant the payment ot $1. an athlete or
oarsmau was entitled to a card of recogni
tion, which card entitles him on presenta
tion to compete in any game held by any
club that is a member ot ihe parent body.
"Heretofore athletes who had competed
in professional ganns in the East." said
Mr. Humphry, "journeypd to the West or
feouih and were permitted to compete in
amateur games because they had creden
tials from sjrue amateur club that had
been misled."
The question of withdrawal from the
Amateur Athletic Union was discussed at
length, but the consensus of opinion was
in lavor of remaining unoer the governing
power of the Pacific Athletic Association,
and the representatives of ihe various
clubs decided mat the regatta, which will
doubtless be ne:d at El CampÂ© in Juno,
will be governed by the rules of the Pa
cific Athletic Association.
A cummittee was appointed to draw up
an application, which will be presented to
the board of governors of the Pacilic Ath
1-tic Associaion, asking them for their
sanction to hold a championship regatta
at Ei Campo in June. The committee se
lected irom among the oarsmen repre
sented consists oi W. O. Patch, S. J. Pem

Eddie Kline Goes Home-
Eddie Kline's big brother went round to the
Pacific Hypnotic Institute on Mission street
Wednesday evening and persuaded Eddie to
go home with him. The boy yesterday
seemed perfectly well satisfied with the change
and declaied his intention to remain at home
with his mother. If his state of mind con
tinuos the charge against him for vagraucy will
probably be dismissed by Judge Campbell on
Saturday.
Messrs. Baker nnd Thornton called at The
Call editoria'-rooms last, night and said that
Tnornton had given young Kline the hypnotic
su&rcrestion to go home and stay there.
"You remember," said Thornton, "that
Kline said In court he would rather go to the
reform school than go home. Njw ne says
that he is glad to be home, and that he in
tends to stay there. That is because of tho
hypnotic suggestion I gave him. The sugges
tion will influence him as long as I choose."

CONSTANT FENCING FOR
DELAY.
His Attorneys Finally Decide
Not to Cross-Examine
Livernash.
: SOME PEOMISES THAT WERE
KOT KEPT.
More Details of the Attempt to Break
Up the Bush-Street Theater
Mcc tir.g
Thai little chapter of the inside manipu
lations of tne stock of tne People's Home
Savings Bank, by which Receiver John F.
â¢ Sheehan and his attorney, James A. Watt,
YESTERDAY'S WITNESSES IN THE MARRIOTT CASE.
secured the election of a board of directors
' in July, 189 i of their own creation, prom
ises to make history.
It may be that when Judee J. C. B. Heb
bard undertook the effort he is now mak
ing in Judge Daingerfield s court to gae
freedom of speech, he made no
reciconing of the facts Eiward J. Liver
nash recited. At any ra c the story toM
by the assistant managing editor of the
Examiner, which is Hebbard's journalis
tic mouthpiece, is to go unchallenged.
After forty-eight hours of careful delibera
tion, during wh:ciÂ» resource wa- had to
both Watt and Sheehan, Judge Hebbard's
attorneys have decided that they will not
cro*s-examine that witness.
Livernash appeared in court yesterday
. ready to be gri'.Jed or fricasseed, whichever
way Attorney Kahn might wi3h; bathe
had bis pains for nothing. Kahn an
nounre.i that he believed he "would
waive the cros?-eiamination of this wit
ness." He did not give any particular
reasons fur ibis somewhat peculiar devi
ation from court procedure, relying en
tire, v on his privilege as a prosecuting at
torney.
And so it happened that Livernash did
not have ;he privilege o! aild ins any se
quel to the story, "'How the depositors of
the Ppople's Home Savings Bank failed to
vote 1300 shares of stock at tne election in
IB94"
But in order to draw out more details
Attorney Shortridye had the newspaper
man recite in detail the wiliinguess of the
old board of bant directors to re.Â«ign, if
allowed by Jud<re Hobbard, in order tliat
the bank might be taken charge of by the
depositors. Livernasli related the desire
of his client, U. H. McDonald Jr.. to sever
His connection with the bank. He nego
tiated wth the Anglo-Californian and
Crocker-Woolworth buik* with a view of
having either of these undertake the liqui
dation of the savinus bank, if agreeable to
the. depositors. Bat it was all in vair..
Judge Hebbard's injunction restraining
the old board of directors from carrying
out their intention of resigning was an
effectual check to all the wishes of the de
positors.
Attorney D. M. Delma* told of frequent
appeals made to Judge Hebbard to relax
or modify this injunction. As one of the
attorneys of tb.3 old bonrd of directors he
nad called on Judge Hebbard in his cham
bers with some of the members of the de
positors' committee and Attorney Hutton
and asked him to modify the injunction to
the extent of allowing the board to meet
and resign in favor of a new one solected
by the depositors. Judge Hebbard agreed
to this programme and suggested that the
transfer of directorate might be made in
an adjoining room. It was proposed to
have the old directors resign one by one,
nd as each vacancy occurred it would be
filled by a selection ol the depositors.
"Was the willingness of the old board to
step out called to Judge Hebbard's atten
t.on? ".
â¢' "It was In open court, and was com
mon notoriety for weeks."
In due time Attorney Dalmas stated
that Judge Hebbard was called upon to
moduy the injunction, Dut he aiclared
."no such understanding and no such
agreement had been reached."
"I replied that it was idle to make this
statement," continued tho lawyer, "aÂ«
others be>ides myself had heard , him
agree to this; but the â¢ oort was master of
the situation, aria we . were obliged to
submit." '- . u.-sf ;:
- "What wÂ»s it stood in tho way of carry
ing out itie agreement reached between
tt:eolcl board and the depositors?".
'The courtâ Jiidpe Hebbard."
Attorney Delraas. continuing, said he
bad advised Judge Hebbard that he had
no jur sdiction in the matter or rigbt to
.appoint a receiver and ;hat the Bucreme
Court had upheld him by declaring Shee
han's appointment null and void.
The attempt of Hebbard and hi* politi
cal "heelers" to break into the meetine of
bank depositors he.d at the liusn-stseet
Theater was aeain referred to.
Arthur H. Williams, who acted as as
sistant doorkeeper at the meeting, was
tbe first witness. Judge Hebbard, as far
as could te learned, had no richt in the
theaier, as admission was limited to ac
tual depositors in the bank. But such a
trifling scruple as this was easily over
come. As soon as Hebbard put in an ap
pearance he invoked the aid of Police
Sergeant Cook, who was present to pre
serve order, and that official cleared tiie
way for him into the hail, despitH the pro
tests and remonstiances of the doorkeep
ers. Some of Hebbard's friends also
trained admittance at tne same time, un
der the patronizing wing of the police
officer, and when A.torney bhortridge
a^ked the witness for their names there
was the usual protest from Attorney
Katin.
"We simply wisli to show," said Attor
ney Shortridcs, repeating the question*
"that there was a Concerted movement of
rucferoliers and political bums to break ur>
that meeting in the interests of Judge
llehbard."
Mr. Williams could not recall tÂ«e iden
tity of the others who forced their wav
into the hall in company with Hebbard.
John F. Sheehan and Sam K. Thornton
put in an appearance a few minutes later
but were refused admittance. The same
fate befell Harry Clarke, an instructor in
swimming ai the Olympic Club. Williams
did not know Harrison Jones, Hebbard's
stenographer, and his court clerk. Robert
H. Fitzgerald. He knew that Milk In
spector Dockery was in the hall shouting
for Hebbard, but could not recall that he
went through the front door.
Attorney Shortriitre .isked whether Wil
liams knew that Dockery and Fitzgerald
piloted a mob of Hebbard's sympathizers
through a rear entrance into the meeting,
but lias was beyond his k lowledge.
On cross-examination Williams toUi
Assistant District Attorney Hinkle that
Hebbard had showed no bank book when
he forced his way into the ttieater.
"Didn't you put your hands on Judge
Hebliard's shoulders and didn't he say,
'Take your hands off. I have a bank book
in mv pocket?"
"He did not," was the reply, and Hin
k!p dropped the inquiry.
Edwiu F. Kendan, one of the members
of the depositors' committee, after an
swering a lew preliminary questions, was
excused, the Slate and Hebburd admitting
tuat he would corroborate the testimony
of the other commiiteemen relative to
fcueehan's acts us receiver.
James \V. Coffroth, the secretary of the
Superior Court Judges, was present at the
Bush-street Theater meetinsr by virtue of
his being a depositor in the bank. Attor
ney Shortridge was curious to know the
amount of bis deposit and the date of his
bank book, but the Hebbard faction seemed
to dread this piece of information and
protested to the court successfully.
.Robert H. Fitzgerald, Judge Hebbard 's i
i court clerk, was also at the meeting.
i Hebbard's stenographer, Harrison Jones,
had conveniently loaned him a passbook
for the oCi'aMon." Fitzgerald declared that
he hai behaved himseif on the occasion.
Wuen Attorney Shorir;deeat'.eruD:ed to
learn if Jonea had been "lending" pass
! books to other people Attorney Kabn got
in with hands and feet, with the result
! that Judge Daingerfie.d thought the in
quiry irrelevant.
M;lk Inspector Dockeryâ resplendent
Dockery â proved to have been an active
i worker to break Dp the meeting.
He admitted that he "had the plea-ure
! of placing a friend in nomination lor
j chairman," but, strangely enough, could
| not remember "the IriendV name unti
prompted t,y Hebbard's attorneys. Dock
ery's candidate proved to be a man named
Gregory, who was plated for the chair by
some of Hebbard's tympathizers who
were present.
The milk inspector admitted that he
had his weapons on him, but denied that
he attempted to use them when the raem
! bers of the depositors' committee remon
| s; rated with him for interrupting the
meeting.
Attorney Shortridge desired 10 have C.
E Palmer, secretary of the bank, read the
record of moneys paid to Receiver Shee
| nan from the records of the bank.
"I wish to siiow," said the attorney,
â  "that sums of money were drawn by the
receiver against the wishes of the deposit
ors Hnd allowed by the court or Judge
Hebbard. The court records show tliat
i when the pretended accounting was pre
sented to Judge Hebbard at the time of
i Sheehan's discharge Attorney Bartnett,
ion behalf of the California Safe Deposit
j and Trust Company, the assignee of
I $727,000 worth of deposit*, objected to the
J accounting on the ground that it was not
i a proper one, that it had been aliowed
â¢under a blanket resolution passed by a
! board of directors of the receiver's own
! creation.
"I wish to show by the books that cer
] tain payments were made under this binn
ket ratification of illegal acts which
shouM never have been paid. Sheehan
went into atul took possession of the bank
jby an order of the court. At the outset
I and subsequently it was maintained that
the order w;is null and void. Tne court
cannot authorize, nor can any one else
authorize, moneys to be paid under an il
legal order. In the end, however, some
| body attempts to ratify ttie actions of this
receiver. Now it is said that this board of
directors ratifies all these actions by a
blanket resolution, and that the court
had nothing to do but sit as an auto
maton. As a receiver Sheehan was a
steward of the court, and he presents an
indorsement from these direciors certify
ing to his conduct. Surely it is idle to say
that because this blanket resolution wns
preseni that the court is absolved from all
liability, because bis attention was called
to it, and because the application of wise
and riant rules of law would Lave an
nulled these payments."
Judge Daingertield inquired if the pro
priety of any of the payments or transac
tions bad been called to Judge Hebbard's
attention.
Attorney Shortridge repliel that Heb
bard knew that Sheehan was acting ille
gally, because the Supreme Court had de
clared the order of his appointment was
null and void. "Afterward this receiver
appears in court and a>ked that he be dis- j
charged and his bondsmen exonerated. ]
Then comes Attorney Bartnett and objects
to the accounting, and in reply She. nan
presents this b anket resolution. We are
charged in our alleged libel with declaring
that Judge Hebburd was morally responsi
ble for losses tv the depositors of the bank,
and here we show that there was certainly
an illegal abstraction of funds trom the
bank, because the receiver was working
iit.uer an order that the Supreme Court
declared null and void. We take the po
â¢uioa under tbeaeclrcamiUacestbat any
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1897.
one might be justified in saying that
Judge Hebbard was morally responsible
for losses resulting to the stockholders
throuch the actions of his servant or offi
cer. I maintain that a Judge is morally
responsible who, when warned, shuts his
eyes and permits an illegal thing to be
done."
Judge Daingerfield intimated that Judge
Hebbard's attention may not have been
called to any individual illegal sums
drawn by the receiver.
Attorney Shortridge, in reply, again
recalled that Attorney Bartnett had pro
tested against Sheehan's account at the
time Hebbard discharged him. It was for
the jury, then, to decide if Editor Marriott
was justified under the circumstances in
declaring that Hebbard was moraliy re
sponsible for the losses lo the depositors
through Sheehan'a mismanagement.
Hebbard's attorney fought vigorously
against the production of the bank records,
and in the end the court decided not to al
low them until Attorney Shortridge pro
duced further proof that Hebb-trd was
aware that Sheehan had been drawing and
paying money illeaallv.
The case will go on Monday next.

HELD SPRING OPENING.
I The Thirty-Seventh Exhibition
of the San Francisco Art
Association.
An Exce lent C ncert Given at the
Mirk Hopkins Institute of Art
L.st N gut
The annual spring exhibition of the San
Francisco Art Association took place last
eveninp at the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art. The attendance was not particularly
large, in fact it was just comfortable, and
the pictures and muse were far more en
joyable than if there had been a huge
crowd to jostle and otherwise weury the
critics.
The music, under the direction of
Henry Heyinan, was of unusual excel
lence. The organ prelude, "Preciosa," by
Yon Weber, was very well done by
Emilio Crueils. The be sttning on the pro
gramme, however, was a trio, Miss Mabel
Johnson, Miss Annette Johnson and Pro
fessor Lombardero, on mandolins and
baniJurrias. Their first number was the
overture "William Tell" by Rossini, and
in reply to repeatea demands they gave
Sancho's "Sueno Tropical." For their
last number they gave a trio of Professor
Lombardero's own comoosition^, the
'Raymond Wfiltz," "Melancholia" and
the "Grand Spanish Carnival March."
Christian Jorgenson, accompanied by
R. Fletcher Tilton, sang "The Holy City,"
by Adams, and "Calm as the Night," by
B'ohm. Miss Eva Shorey ?ang "My
Mother Bid* Me Bind My Hair," by Hav
den, and Vannini's "Mem Giebcuen."
For an encore she gave "Confession," by
Kathern Rodcers. Later on la the even
ing she *ang Tosti's "Donna Vorrei Morir,"
and "Without Thee" by d'Hardelot. Xn
organ "March Religieuse" by Meyerbeer,
played by Mr. Creulls completed a most
excellent pro rramme.
The next concert will take place on
Thursday evening. May 13.

LAST TRIBUTE
FOR THE DEAD
The Masonic Burial Service
Over the Body of Clay
Webster Taylor.
Heartfelt Tribute to the Memory
of the Departed Past
Grand Master.
The Anoint Order of Workmen, of
Which Deceased Had Been Granl
Master, Represented.
The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons of the Sttte of California officiated
yesterday afternoon at the funeral ser
vices over the remains of the late Clay
Webster Taylor, past master of the Grand
Lodge of this jurisdiction.
The service was that of the Grand
Lodge and was the first performed by that
body for a long time, death not having
called away any of the members of that
body. It was held in King Solomon's
Hall in the Masonic Temple with all the
impressiveness that the occasion called
for. Tho stations of the several officers
and the altar were draped in mourning, as
was also the entrance to the temple and
the portrait of the deceased, which is in
the gallery in the main hall.
Among the floral offerings was a large
easel contributed by the Grand Lodge ol
the Ancient Order of United Workmen,
of which the deceased was twice grand
master. There was also a iargc piliow
bearing the word "Brother" and a num
ber of bunches of roses and St. Joseph
lilies.
At a quarter after 2 o'clock the casket
was brought into the lodaeroom, followed
by the widow, supported by her brother
in-law, the ton and daughter of the de
ceased and a procession of relatives and
intimate friends, and after the casket, on
which rested a bunch of lilies and a sneal
of grain, the following-named officers ot
the Grand Lodee entered the hall and
filled their several stations.
William T. Lucas, grand master; Thomas
Flint Jr., deputy grand master; *'. M.
Angeiotti, senior grand warden; C. L. Patton,,
junior grand warden; Edward Coleman
grand treasurer; r.eorge Johnson, grand sec*
retary; E. iÂ». Church, grand chaplain ; Franci*
E. Baker, grnnu orator; J. Ladagnous, gran v
lecturer; James 11. Stevens, grand marshal:
J. EHis, grand standard-bearer; L. Osborue,
grand second standard- bearer; William S.
Mo>es. grand Bible-bearer; William G. Brown,
senior grand deacon; E. C. Bouner, junior
grand deacon; H. L. Davis, senior grana utew
ard ; M. V. Taylor, junior grand me ward ; Joha
T. Grey, grand pursuivant; Samuel D. Mayer,
graud organist; James Oglesby, grand tyier.
The Masonic choir â Samuel D. Mayer,
J. R. O.ilvie, J. P. F eniiiif and J. R.
Jonesâ rendered ".Still, Still With Thee,"
after which the grand master, afterstatinc
the occasion ot the assemblage, read from
the burial seivice.
The choir tneii sanj? " Rest, Spirit,
Rest," after which the grand secretary
handed the grand master the sacred roll,
on which he~in*cribed the name and aire
of the deceased, and said, "Almighty
Father, into thy hands we commend the
soul of our beloved brother," and tbe re
sponse by the members of the Masonic
fraternity at the same time giving the
grand honors was, "The will of God 19
accomplished; so mote it be. Amen."
Tbe choir then rendered "Come to Me"
and the grand chaplain offered prayer,
which was followed by the response, "So
mote it be" and the singing of "Sleep
On."
Then Henry E. Higbton, past granu
orator, delivered the eulogy. He brietiy
went over the life of the deceased, paid a
hieh tribute to his worth aa a citizen of ihe
state, a statesman, member of the Ma u onic
fraternity and of the Ancient Order of
Workmen, a husband and father, and said
that, in view of all this, no better step
could have been taken than the heartfelt
tribute to bis memory he saw before him.
He &i oke of the deceased as a man of
honor, integrity, lofty ideas, deep thought
and great sympathy, whose life work will
be felt many generations hence, when his
name shall havo ceased to be ihe subject
of daiiy talk. He closed by stat.ng that
true love never dies, and that there is a
ceriain assurance tnat the separation from
those he loved is but temporary, for the
day of reunion is sure to come.
The grand marshal announced that the
time had come to take a last look at the
face of tbe dead and all in tha rr.om passed
around the casket. As the members of
the Masonic fraternity passed each depos
ited on ttie casket a sprig of accaasia, after
which a procession was formed in the fol
lowing order and the casket was carried to
the hearse :
Thetyler; stewards, with white rods; mas
ter masons; secretary and Ueosurer; junior
and senior wardens; past masters; the holy
writings on a cushion covered with biack
cloth and supported by the descons with
crossed rods; the master; the casket; pall
bearers; mourners.
The pa!!-bearers were from the Grand
LodgeâFrank J. French, Thomas Ander
son. Philip D. Code, N. W. bpauldinu, S.
C. Wa lis and L. D. Schordâ and from the
A.nciÂ«>nt Order of United Workmenâ Past
Grand Muster Workman Frederick Adams.
Grand Master Workman William Vinter,
Grand Receiver Samuel Booth and Grand
Auditor William Broderick.
The remains were then conveyed to the
train and then to Cypress Lawn Cemetery,
where the remainder of the impressive
service was conducted and concluded.
Nearly 200 patents have been issued for
horbesliops, but not one of the inventions
has ever come into general use.

the spine have been injured and weakened. Dr. Sanden's Belt draws them gently back into
their natural position a-id gives them strength. It cures Â«n>l never fails, because iÂ» is properly
applied. There are two ways of treating lame backâ the rigiu uay an<t the wro.ig way. Other

experience has taught him the right way, and nls Belts never fail. ;â  Â«
"Your Bolt cured a red-hot pain that I had in my back for two years. For two weens I

From Washington to
San Francisco.
Plans Have Been Laid to Give
Him a Reception at ths
Presidio Club
Cimolim^nts Paid to Colon:l S. B M.
Ycunp, Who Leav s lor Yellow
stone Park N>xt Week
A message came to the Presidio by wire
from Washington yesterday stating that
General William R. Shatter would leave
that city for San Francisco last evening.
Recently the announcement was made
that General Sbafter would command the
Department of the East, with headquar
ters in New York, while Major-General
Wesley Merritt was abroad taking ob
servations of the war between Greece and
Turkey, but as the major-general i;as now
decided to abandon the journey of ob
servation General Shafter will come West
and probably take command of the De
partment of the Columbia.
Preparations have been made to give
the new brigadier-general a tine reception
at the Presidio Club early next week.
The officers of the First Infantry are
highly gratified over the promotion of
their colonel, and the same feeling of
gratification is manifested in the artillery
and cavalry of the garrison.
Workmen were engaged yesterday in
knocking out one of the wood partitions of
the clubhouse so as to provide one large
room for assembly convenience. The al
terations in progress were planned some
time ago and were not designed for this spe
cial occasion, but work will be pushed to
have the rooms refitted in time 10 receive
the general.
Lieutenant-colonel Young, Fourth Cav
alry, will leave this station next Tuesday
for Yellowstone Park. A reception in his
honor was held at the Presidio Wednesday
afternoon. Captain Ixjckett, Fourth Cav
alry, nnd Mrs. Lockett gave the reception.
The band of the First Infantry played on
the lawn, and all of the oflices of the Pre
sidio and other posts of the harbor called
during the afternoon to pay their respects
to the popular trooper. Among the callers
wÂ«re General Forsyth, Colonel Bates, Col
onel Burton, Major Field, Colonel Smed
berg retired, and many other military men
of di.itin ction.
Colonel i'oung has a brilliant military
record. Hi* enlisted at the first call of
Pres dent Lincoln for troops in April,
1861, joining as a private Company X,
Twelfth Pennsylvania Infantry. He was
discharged August 5, 18(31, and in Septem
ber of the same year commissioned captai'J
Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry. He was
subsequently promoted major lieutenant
colonel and colonel of the rejriment, and
honorably mustered out July 1, 1865. He
was appointed second lieutenant Twelfth
Infantry, U. b. A., May 11, iÂ£G(5; captain
Kiehth 'Cavalry. July 23, 1860, major Third
Cavalry, April 2, 18(nJ. ana subsequently
lieutenant-colonel Fourth Cavalry. He
was breVetted major Jor valiant and meri
torious services in action at Sulphur
Springs, Va. ; lieutenant-colonel forgallant
j and meriiorious services at Amelia
i Springs, Va. ; colonel for heroism at
! bailors Creek, Va., and brigadier-general
for gallant services during the campaign
terminating in the surrender at Appomat
tox. He commanded a brigade of the
cavalry corps, Army of the Potomac, and
was wounded in the actions at Keanston
Sulphur Springs, wounded at the battle oi
Hutohers Run and again wounded at the
battle of Sailors Creek. He served with
bravery and skill on frontier duty since
I the close of the war.
Colonel Young was elected c mmander
of the Loyal Legion California Com
mandery in 1890, and s-erved one term
with credit to himself and the legion.
It is regarded at the PresiJio as practi
cally settled tbatJLieutenan'.-Colonel Evan
Miles, First Infantry, now on duty at
Benicia, will be promoted colonel and as
signed to the command ot the First. The
confirmation of William R. Shatter's
nomination to be brigadier-ganeml leaves
! a vacancy in the grade of colonel, and
Miies is the senior lieuteuant-colonel oi
infantry. Unless some powerful influence
be invoked at Washin ton to promote
some other officer. Colonel Miles will be
appointed. In all probability he will be
post commander at the Presidio before
the Ist of June.

Chicago.
Liverpool cables opened 141 higher. French
marktti were 35 centimes lower for wheat at the
start. The favorab'e conditions of Liverpool were
offset by thn weakness in French markets. At
the opealnc the disposition seemed tame: the
shorti we:e Inclined to await crop reports from
Califo:nl v and the Northwest.
About ten minutes after the opening brokers
: wl;h CalUornlan and Northwestern connections
; began receiving discouraging reports from these
! Rpctions, ncrompanitd by Kood buying order.

Hydrants.

Oakland Office Sab Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 6. f
The little Hack cloud on trie horizon
that threatened to burst into a violent
Btorra lias made its appearance in the City
Council. It com^sin the form of a resolu
tion ordering that all the rire hydrants in
the city be alternated between the
two water companies. Vt present the
Oakland company is supplying all the hy
drants west of Lake Merritt and the Con
tra Costa all those to the east of the lake.
The resolution was introduced by re
quest of several insurance companies, and
in their petition they make the argument
that by alternating the hydrants the city
would, in case of tire, have the full bene
fit of both water systems instead of one, as
at present, and the resolution, based on
the petition, authorizes the Fire and
Water Committee to proceed forthwith
â with such changes.
At first glance this would seem a very
ordinary and bus. ness-like proposition,
but it means a great deal to both the water
companies, who have been for nearly
two years fighting for their existence.
The rents derived from the hydrants are
not their largest source of income, which
is derived fr.'m. the sewer flashing and
street sprinkling, and with the present
distribution of hydrants this would mean
a loss 10 the Oakfan i company nnd a cain
to the Contra Costa company. According
to the message c f Mayor Thomas, it also
means another step toward a forced com
bination of bmh compa' -i-'s.
President Dinge? ot the Oakland com
pany says that the resoution, if passed,
would be a bl >w at the lite of the compe
tition now going on.
"As a iiiatter of fact." said Mr. Dingee,
"the iiydrants of the Oakland company,
which were purchased by us and not oy
ihe city, are as a general rule on larger
mains tnan the Contra Costa company
could connect with. Oursystem is sj con
structed that tnese ni;tin> are connected
at every corner, thuÂ« placing no limit to
the volume oi water, and we have also
stored f^r emer(7Â»ncy within a mile or so
of town 17,000,000 gallons of water at an
elevation which would insure ample pres
sure for any tire we could have for the
next twenty years.
"There was no alarm here abont fires
when there was but one company, and
there is no alarm in San Francisco or any
city which only has one company. In
my opinion this is a me;hoi of our"rivais
.to decrease the income of our company.
"So far we have not made adollar out of
the water bu*inftss. The people have
made it all. We do not want to be driven
out, and the adoption o; this alternating
resolution is a step in that direction. Th;s
scheme is the beginning of a plan to lorce
us in o a partnership arrangement with
the Contra Costa, but it will never be, and
I do not believe that it ii any par; of the
Council's duty to force us into accepting
ove.-turesj from the Contra Ccsla com
) any."
The efficars of the Contra Costa com
pany d. dine 1 to-day to diicuss :he mat
ter. They stated that this movement to
alternate the hydrants was started un
known to them, arid they are not aware
of the origin of it. They say they do not
intend to enter into any controversy, be
lieving that the City Counc 1 and the pub
lic can dec.de among themselves what is
for their best interests.
\Yh n the matter came before the Fire
and Water Committee last nieht the mem
bers decided mat it w:is a matter to be
dealt with by the Council as a committee
of the whole, and a motion to this effect
was made. A !iuie latter it was aj;ain
broueht up and ttie committee decided to
reconsider the whole matter et their next
meeting.
"This is goins to be one of the hardest
rights we have ever had in the city of Oik
land," said Mr. Cuvellier at the meeiii.g.
"I know it and you know it, and 1 do not
think it any use to was c time hearing all
the arcumt-nts that will certainly be pone
over aga:n by the Council a* a whole. It
looks like a skirmish in advance of the
battle."

Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,)
yuÃ Broadway, May ti. )*
The cities of Oakland and Alameda are
now regretting that they did not have in
serted in the bill regulating bridge-build
ing by Supervisors a section relating to
tunneling. Treasurer T'orderer of Ala
meda was of the opinion that such a
clause was to have been included in the
provisions of the bill, but such is not the
case, and if a tunnel be built beneath the
estuary it will have to be done without
the financial help of the county.
The opinion of the District Attorney,
stating that the Supervisors could not
at this time without further legislative
power taKe any hand in ttie construction
of a tunnel, has proved very dishearten
ing to the civic and mercantile bodies of
both cities, who had expected that tne
Supervisors would shoulder the biggest
half of the cost. They cannot do this,
and consequently much time will elapso
before a tunn> 1 is built under the estuary.
"This tunnel proposition is a spiendid
one," said Supervisor Church, "biu it has
not been f lly considered in all its de
tails. The tact does not appear to have
been noticed that for a bridge, even a
double-decked one, the approach would
commence at Third street, whereas fora
tunnel it would bÂ» nece*Â«ary to commence
the approach at Sixth street. From the
point where the tunnel commenced to the
waier front the street would practically
be mined, and this would mean many
thousands of dollar* of damage Â«uits from
property-owners, whicn would, in my
opinion, be allowed them. Not one word
of this phase of the situation has been
sa;d, and it would be one of the most im
portant factors in the case.
"At the present time a tunnel is not an
actual necessity, although it would be the
best thins to do in view of the luturc
growth of these two cities. Perhaps even
with the damage s>uits a tunnel would
prove the least expensive of the two meth
ods of crossing tne estuary, but nothing
can be undertaken now except by the
municipalities and clrtzens independent

of any help :rom the county. There was
no reason why ttie tunnel clause â¢houid
not have been incorporated in the bill. At
this inte date, however, it is of no am for
Mr. Forderer to express regret, becatis** lie
was the last man to handle the bill before
it was mailed to Sacramento and he cer
tainly knew what was in it."
Another conference wi.l be held in a few
days between the various parties most
interested, and a plan will be outlined in
accordance with the nÂ»w conditions.
EZETA IS PEACEFUL.
Tho General Not Anxious for Any
More Political Power.
OAKLAND, Cal., May General An
tonio Ezeta, who is now living in this
city, is very much annoyed at the story
recently publi hed in a San Francisco
evening paper Miat be intends to lead an
other army on Honduras.
"I conclude that this information comes
from the source interested in Injuring
me," sa:d the general :o-day. "Ever sincu
the happenings of 1894 I have :ooked for
safety on foreign soil. My only care has
been the education of my little girls, to as
to satisfy my persecutors that I am not
hunting political ventures, I have to es
tabii-h myself here with my family, away
ironi the contact of those who wisii strife
in Central America.
"Thestorvuf this alleged expedition is
not only false, but I protest most ernphat
lcaliy against all such association*. The
experience of many years has convinced
me that the prosperity of the people is
through labor and peace, un<ler any form
ot eovernment. and not through the risks
of war.
"Therefore I do not intend to make nor
protect any revolution which wnl chance
tho actual order of affairs in my country.
Ii it is a fact ih it dome are working to de
stroy Guiterrez's administration and
cnange the avst^m of the Greater Republ c,
mat is not my work, neither should tbe
responsibility be imputed to me by pub
lishing imaginary stories without any
foundation."
THE TUHNEL MATTER.
Does the General or the Spnclal Law
tioTern the Question ?
ALAMEDA. Cal., May 6.â Alameda
people felt disappointed when they read
in tho tuurninK papers that District At
torney Snook had eivsn it as his opinion
[hat the Supervisor- bad no power lo con
j s.ruct a iuuaei under the estuary instead
of a bridge across it. This opinion be
based on a r racial law which was passed
by the last L'gislature empowering tha
Supervisors to comoine with the railroad
in the construction of a double bridge
over the estuary. When the law was
drawn up here it was definitely un
derstood by the people that it was to pro
vide for either a tunnel or a bridge, and
District Attorney Snoot was instructed to
make it read that way. But he did not
do so, and the omi-sion was not detected
until after it passed one house. It was
then !ate in tha session, and rather than
risk the defeat of the bill it was decided
not to try to amend it.
Bui the friends of the tuinel i lÂ»Â»a claim
that this speciul law does not affect the
general law, which empowers Supervisors
to construct roads, brkiees and adjuncts
to highways. They claim that a tunnel
is an adjunct to a highway and that a
crossine to a stream either over or under
it is fully justified by th? law, as the
Supervisors may elect. Tuey propose to
follow this idea and show that they are
correct.
Bu - even if unsuccessful in persuading
the Superv sors to do what it is believed
they have a right to they will not abandon
the fight. It is conceded that under the
general law the cities ot Oakland and
Alameda can build a tunnel, though why
the county cannot as well is not explained.
In any event, should one resource fail ttie
effortwill be made to induce thn cities to
undertake the work, and as there is a vait
preponderance in favor of it there would
be little difficulty in getting bonds voted
for the purpose.
A Library Deadlock.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 6.â There is a
deadlock in the Board of Library Trustees
over a little matter of patronage, namely,
the appointment of a second assistant.
When the present board went into oiÃce
Miss Mary Harbnuuh was removed, and it
was decided to engaee two assistants and
to divide the salary between ihem. Mrs.
Marceila Krauth was selected as the rir-t
assistant and the appointment of the
other one went over. It now appears that
there have been too many promises of
support ma<ie by trustees, and as a result
they are not aoie to airee upon the other
appointment. The- leading candidates are
Miss Helen Wignin, daughter of M. P.
Wiggin. and Miss Carrie Pratt, at present
stenographer of the Del Norte County Su
perior Court.

Ladies' Kelief Society.
OAKLAND, Cal., May â The annual
meeting of the Ladies' Rfliei Society W3S
hold tli afternoon. The trensurer's re
port shows that while everything is in
pood shape it has been necessary to draw
$200"Â» during the year lrom the savin?* ac
count. The receipts amounted to $9802
and the disbursements to $11,152.
This is the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the relief society, which supports old
ladies' and children's homes at Temescal.
It was organ iz a l in old St. Paul's Church
November 9, 1871. One of the reasons for
the deficit in the finances is that the fifty
shares of the Contra Co-<ta water stock
donated by the late Mr. Cnabot used to
produce an income of $250 a month, but
for some time no dividends have been
paid. All the officers were re-elected.

THE COMING BENGH SHOW
Score* of Prize- Winning D"JJÂ« Entered
for the kenn#l Exhibition.
The approaching bench show of the San
Francisco Kennel Club has awakened
owners and breeders throughout the length
of the coast. At the office of the ciub,
224 Montgomery street, entries hsva been
coming in during the past week at a rate
that indicates an asrgr gation of dogs on
the bench greater than ever before. Many
of tbe dogs themselves are alao being
brought to the City.
Among the latter arrivals a pair of St.
Bernard's from Montana is arousing much
speculation. Tuese dogs have neither of
them been seen in tne Ciiy heretofore,
and are being Kept well under cover. An
other Si. Bernard, expected to matte a
prominent bid for the iaurels of his ore<>d,
is Koxey Savage, owned by Dr. A. Miles
Taylor of Oakland. But speculation in
the St. Bernard ranus extend* over a wiJe
territory. Some slight breach has re
cen;ly divided the various owner-' of the
breed; nevertheless the St. Bernard show
ing this year will be unprecedented.
In the smaller classes Uie number of
large kennels shown will be worthy of
note. Cocker Â«paniels are being entered
in goodly numbers, and among them sov
erai kennels of particularly good appear

THE RISE OF
BUDDHISM
IN INDIA
Its History Outlined by
Dharmapala the
Hindoo.
HOW THE MOVEMENT
STARTED.
ladia Once More, Alter 700 Years,
the Holy Land of
Buddhists.
THE PRIEST'S MISSION TO
AMERICA.
Came in tha Cause of Love and Truth
and Brotherhood, ar.d Recog
nizing No Creed.
The following history of the revival of
Budddism in Inaia ha 9 been contributed
by Anagarika H. Dharmapala, the dis
tiuguished Hindoo priest, who was in
this City some months ago:
In tne year IS9I a movement was founded
in the island ol Ceylon under the name of the
Maha-l'odhi Society, "for the resuscitation of
Buddhism in the land of Us birth." As the
chiei representative and general secretary of
thai society I established its headquarters in
Calcutta and commenced to work lor the uni
fication and consolidation of the different
branches of Buddhism in Asia, as well as to
work In harmony with the Aryan nations of
ludin.
In IS'J2 the society had become individual
ized and Budiihists of Ceylon, Burmah. China,
Japan, Tibet, .Siam and Arakan began to look
up to India once more, alter 700 years, as the
holy land of the Bud-mists.
The historian of the Indian empire, Sir W.
W. Banter, in his monumental work, "The
Indian Empire,/' in mentioning the society,
gays that a "revival o; Buddtiism is, I repeat,
one of i he present posxibilties iv India. The
liie and teachings of Buddha are also begin
ninc to exerc se a new influei cc on religious
ihuuehi in Europe and America. As that
teac-niug becomes more accurately known to
the Western world, it will be divested of me
mystical precisions with which Certain o:
us" modern professors have obscured it. Budd
hism will s and forth as ihe < rnbodiment of
tlie eternal verity thai as a man sows he will
reap; associated with the personal duties ef
mastery over 6eit and kindness to all men,
and quickened into a popular relijrion Dy the
example of a noble and beauti'.ul life."
In ISO 3, us the representative of the Ceylon
Buddlusis, accepting the cordial invitation of
I)r. Jonn Henry Bartow.s, I came in Septem
ber, 189:5, to take part in the deliberations of
the parliament of religions.
In 1893 and 1894, hav.ng visited the Budd
hist countries of Japan, China, Siam, Burman,
Ceylon, I returned to India in May and re
sumed work.
From May, 1894, to May, 1896, I was en
gaged in India in a bloodless crusade of
peace, which resulted in rescuing the sacred
site which, like the holy seoulcher to the
Christians, is held in veneration by ali
Buddhists. It is failed the Mihn-Bodhi,
where Prince Siddhartha became Buddha.
For over seven hundred years the place was
held by al ens after the destruction of Budd
hism in India by the Mohammedan con
querors. For fall five years I had to struggle
and toil hard to accomplish the work which I
had pledged my li le for, and haviug suc
ceeded iv laying the found* Hons oi a union
for the consolidation of different Buddhist
nations, and having established a bond of
brotherhood between tlie Budahis;s and the
Aryan people of India, I have come to the
United States to give my services to the people
whom I love and admire.
Emerson, your beloved poet-philosopher,
b.HB said, 'America, thy name is opportunity,"
and your other poet, James Russell Lowell,
has said thai, "Once to every man and nat on
comes the moment to 'ieciiie in the sirile of
truth with falsehood for the good or evil
side." "The New Worid," says Dr. I'aul
Carus. "is like a new dispensation with new
possibilities for a higher, nobler and grander
covenant. What was left uuaone in Benares,
the center of an old civilization, in Jerusalem
a city sacred to three religions, in Rome the
venerable see of the Popes, and in London the
home of modern science. and industry, has
been accomplished by the bo.d spirit of Chi
cago enterprise. A parliament of all the re
llgious of the world has become an actual lact
01 history."
M .- mission to the peop'e of the United,
Slates is one of love, truth and brotherhood. I
recognize no creed, dogma, nor caste; and
weaith to me is not the criterion of man's
greatness. 1 owe allegiance to truth and
righteousness and welcome every man who
leads the unselfish life, to co-operate with me
in the work oi uplifting man from the mire of
â uperstition, ecclesiastical dogmas and ignor
ance.
Tne spirit of Buddha and of Jesus is based
on love. Man, fallen man, is the subject of
their service. To save him they sacrificed
everything. The one for four numberless and
100,600 world periods incarnated life alter life
to become Buddha. Imriug his last earth
life, as Prince SiadharthK, he renounced wife,
child, parents and throne for the sake of suf
fering humanity, and for the purpose of sav
ing the world from the fetter- of priesicrcft,
ceremonialism, theology and faithlessness;
the other died on the cross preaching for
giveness.
Religion to-day consists too much in payinc
"tithe of mint and anise and cummin," and
have "omitted the weightier matters of the
law, j'i Ipment, mercy and laith." (Matt.
XXiU
In the Bible I read:
"B.essed a:e ihey which do hunger and thirst
after righteousness, lor ihey shall be filled."
"He that loveth his life shall lose it; he that
bateth his life In this world shall keep It unto
life eternal."
"A new commandment I give unto you, that
' ye love one another."
"If ihou be perfect, sell all and give to the
poor."
' "Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no
morf."
â¢â¢Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
Lord, sha.i enter the kingdom of Heaven; but
he tliht doeih the will of my Father."
"Tho.se who despise others and exalt them
selves shall be Ã¼ba^ d."
AH men cannot receive this saying: "There
shall be eunuchs which have made themselves
I'unuchs for ihe kingdom of heaven's sake.
He that is able to receive it, let him receive
i."
"If thou wilt enter the life keep the com
mandments:
"Th'.u shalt not kill.
"Thou shalt not commit adultery.
"Thou shall not steal.
â¢â¢Thou shalt not bear false witness."
And substantially the same teachings are
found in the Old Testament. I read Id Isaiah
lxvi, "He that kilieth an ox is as If he slew
a man"; and in Exodus xxii:2B, "Thou
shalt not revile !he gods"; and in Habakkuk
11:15, '-Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor
drink, that putteth thy bottle to him and
maki-st him drunken also"; and in Isaiah
vii :15, "Butter and honey shall he eat that he
may kn>w to refuse the evil and cnoose the
go"d"; and in Jeremiah xxviii:9, "The
prophet that prophesieth of peace when the
word 01 the prophet shall come to pass then
shall the proph t be known that the Lord
hath truly sent him"; and in chapter xxxi I
read: "1 will make â¢ new covenant with the
house of Israel, not according to the covenant
I made with their fathers.
â¢'ln those days they shall say no more, The
fathers have eaten sour grapes and the chil
dren's teeth are set on edge, but every man
shall die for his own iniquity; every man that
eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on
edÂ«*e."
In Isaiah v:22, I read: "Woe unto them
that are mighty to drink wine and men of
strength to miuple strong drink."
And In Daniel i:8, I find the following:
"But Daniel proposed in his heart that he
would not defile himself with th 6 portion of
the king's meat nor with the wine which he
drank.
"Then said Daniel: 'Prove thy servant!, I
beseech thee, ten day?, and let them give us
pulse to eat and water to driuk.' '
Again in Daniel iv:27, the following oc
curs: "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be
acceptable uuto thee and break off thy sins by
righteousness and thine Iniquities by showing
mercy to the poor.''
Jesus declares: "For with what judgment
ye judge ye shall be judged, and with what
measure ye mete it shall be measured to you
again."
To the multitude he spoke: "Yo are the
light of the world." Elsewhere I read that
'â¢when he saw the multitude he was moved
with compassion."
'â¢For whosoever shall do the will of my
Father which is in heaven the same is my
brother and sister and mother."
Tne elements of a universal religion I found
in the verses I iiave quoted, and as they were
in perfect harmony with the teachings of
Buddha 1 decided to give a portion of my ser
vices to Christ, and in the spirit el truth, love
aud brotherhoodâ basic principles of my re
ligionâl stand here to-day to work with the
followers of Christ in combating the evils of
drink, slaughtering oi animals, and belnsh
ness.
The only universal religion which is the
elder sister of Christianity is Buddhism, which
has existed for twenty-lour centuries in A ia
and which is now being seriously studied by
Western scholais on account of its profound
philosophy.
The founder of this religion is Gautama, the
Buddha, whose beautiful life nas been made
familiar by Edwin Arnold to English readers
in his immortal euic, the "Light of Asia,"
The philosophical side of Buddha's religion
has been clearly shown in the introduction to
"The Gospel of Buddha," by Dr. Paul Caru*,
and H. c. Warren in his "Buddhism iv Trans
lation*" (Harvard University), .has, for the
first lime, translated the original Pail texts to
show the psychology ol Buddhism. Dr. Hop
kins in his "Religions of India" says:
"It was the individual Buddha that capti
vated man; it was the teachiag that emanated
from him that tired enthusiasm ; icwas his posi
tion as an aristocrat that made him accept
able to the aristocracy; his magnetism that
made him the idol of his people. From every
page stands out the strong, attractive person
ality of this teacher and winner of hearts; he
wandered among meu simply and t>erenely,
speaking with majestic sweetness, the master
to each, the friend to aIL His voice was sin
gularly vibrant and eloquent, his very tones
convinced the heareri his looks inspired awe."
Elsewhere he says:
"At least one thing may be learned from
Buddnism. It is possible to be religious with
out being d. vout. True Buddhism is tue only
religion which, discarding ail animism, con
sists in character and wisdom. One must re
nounce all stilish desire and live to build up
a character of which the signs are purity, love
for all, and that courageous wisdom which is
cÂ«lm insight inio truth. The Buddhist worked
out his own salvation without fear or trem
bling. From the pi>int of view of the hl^iier
morality one must confess that Buddhism
offers the b^st parallel to the best of to-day.
On the otiicr baud, Buddhistic altruism ex
ceeds all others."
Pure Christianity, freed irom ecclesiastical
dogmas and personal opinions of the early
church fathers and later reformers, is sub
l:me. My desire is to tell the people that the
help of tue priesthood and commentators is
not necessary to understand Christ's teach
ings, which he preached to the multitudes of
Galilee and Judea. Surely we are not behind
in intelligence and understanding to the
peasants oi Palestine. The pure figure of the
Hon of man has been obscured by the glitter
and tiusel of ecclesiastical ceremonialism.
The money lenders and sellers of doves have
polluted the temple of truth. Religion is not
belief, but life, immortality consists in doing
noble deeds, not in vain repetitions and lip
prayer, and In tho making of proselytes.
Buddhism teaches mÂ»n to accept truth, not
antnoritv. Revelation, priesis, tradition, au
thoriiv are not the criteria of truth. We ac
cept truth because on its own virtue, without
;â¢ ar, prejudice, hatred, and iv a spirit of In
quiry, we are asked to examine truth before
accepting it. Buddha's great mission to the
world is to emancipate the human mind from
the fetters of priestly theology, and to warn
the blind leaders of the blind.
It is a temp. c of truth thnt we want, with
Buddha and Christ as our example*, and I am
extremely desirous of laying the foundations
oi this new movement In the American Maha-
Bodid Society, having truth as the lignt to
guide us. The following are tho objects of the
organization:
(1) To encourage a sympathetic exchange
of thought between Buddhisits and Christians.
(2) To show to man in the most impressive
way important truths taught in common by
various religions.
(3) To promote the love and worship of
truth and deepen the spirit of brotherhood in
the love and service of niau aud compassion to
animals.
(i) To indicate the reasons for man's faith
In immortality and to unite and strengthen
the forces which are averse to a materialistic
philosophy of the universe.
(5^ To show that religion consists not in the
obseivauce of meaningless ceremonials, but
in the real zation of the i.obie, unselfish life
by the practice of mercy, charity, truth, pur
rity, kindness and goodness.
The special work of the movement is to
organize a band of unselfish workers to preach
ihe gospel of love and broihernood and to
elevate the masses in America aud Asia. India
is the fertile soil ior sewing the seed of the re
lig'on of love. Sectarian Christianity as
preached by Eurouean missionaries is a lail
ure. Tne methods hitherto maintained for
spreading Christian dogmatics must be aban
doned. The millions ol money spent in print
ing tracts about nellflre, eternal damua:ion
ar.d eternal heaven may be utilized for a noble
mist ion work iis educating the pool as it is
done in America. The work will be appre
ciated by the people, and the motives being
pure, asymDaihy wiii oe created in the minds
oi the peoj le ior the religion of Christ. The
old methods of reviling the gods and denounc
ing the customs of Hindoos retard ail work.
The Christian missionary, to get the good will
of the people in India and in Buddhist coun
tries, should abstain from eatiiii beei. It is
ouiy the outcasts tnat eat beef aud drink wine
in India, and they are uot admitted within
the precincts of the house of even a Sudra,
not to speak of a Brahman. It is the customs
and diet oi the Christian European which are
looked on with abomination by all classes
of Hindoos. No religious teacher in India
touches i-ither of them. He is the example
of ascetism Â»nd goes to the extreme of morti
fying the body and the mis-ionary goes to the
opposite extreme ot leading the sensual life of
tne t.picurean. Let the missionary adopt the
mid-i.e life; let him abstain frum liquor and
beef.
The ox and the cow to the Asiatic Aryan are
useful for the sustenance of life. The rice that
l;e eats, the milk that he drinks, the butter
that he uses is obtained through and from the
cow. A spuciai characteristic of the Aryan is
his loya.ty aud gratitude to all. Yadhisthlr,
the great King, it is Mid, had a faithful dog
which he t"ok alonf with him wherever he
went. The God of Heaven Invited him to enter
heaven ; and Yndhis uir wanted that the dog
â bould be aso admitted; but wiien his request
was refused, Yadbistbir for the sakeoi the
dog, it is :-a;d, declined to enter heaven. Tne
Ary.tn appreciates the mail who shows com
passion 10 (anno animals. Tneoxistue com
panion of the god Siva, and the Hindoo* love
the animal for two reasons, for its usefulness
aud for the sake oi their god. It is an un
pardonable crime to kill the ox, and it is un
just to destroy so innocent and useful an
animal. The European has all sorts of other
meats in the shape of mutton, fish, etc., wnich
he couia eat In India, and I therefore advise
that it would be ; weii for the future propagation
even of dogmatic Christianity if the European
would abstain irom beef.
Tne birth of the meek and lowly Jesus in a
stable having an ass and ox for hig compan
ions, sureiy ought to make the Christians
think oi ihe significance of this word. It is
an objective lessoi: for the people to realize
tha; he came to stop -acrifiee and preach com
passion. To th>' Aryan Hindoo, it is an object
lesson to show mercy to our dumb brethren.
In he name <f him trh.o wanted m.-rcy and
not .sacrifice, i uppenl to you to show compac
tion to useful and Innooei t animais.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1897.
ENDEAVORERS IN
MASS CONVENTION
Golden Gate Union Fills
First Congregational
Church.
A "Practce Gathering" in
Anticipation of the Big
Time in July.
The Great Gathering the Sulj ct of
Discussionâ The Workers G?t
ting Ready.
The mass-convention of Golden Gate
Union, held last evening at the First Con
gregational Church, was very properly
named, foi it was just thatâ a mass-con
vention, completely filling the church.
The bhurch was handsomely decorated
with purple and gold, in bunting and
flowers. The galleries were draped and
festoons bung down from the big organ ;
Ibe pulpit and platform were dressed with
palms and yellow poppies, and on one
tide swung the golden banner of the En
deavorers, and between the festoons,
against the pipes of the organ, were the
letters " C. E." in yellow flowers.
The convention was merely a "practice
gatherine," so to speak, to anticipate the
spirit and talk over the plans of the big
July convention. The programme was an
excellent one to the purpose, the "busi
ness" being interspersed with good music
and pointed addresses.
.1. S. Webster had for his subject "The
'97 Convention." He told of some of the
preparations for receiving the "great
army of fresh-laced, strong-spirited and
high-purposed ytumg Christians, who will
invade the City in July."
Great arches are to be erected in the
street testifying welcorje to the visitors,
receptions are to be held in Mechanics'
Pavilion, rather than in Woodward's, and
a concert is to be given them on the even
ing of the 6tb of July, a concert of 1000
voices, the iike of which has never been
heard in this City.
He said that after much labor the rates
have finally been secured and determined
over all the transcontinental roads of a
one-way fare for the round trip from tne
Missouri Kiver, with stop-over privileges
in California and over the northern roads
at points of interest on them.
He called for a demonstration in behalf
of "the creat lever" in securing tnese ad
vantages, and who was present in the
church.
Tne big audience broke into applause
supplemented with the waving of hand
kerchiefs in greeting to â though the name
was not mentioned â Holla V. Watt.
Another call ior applause was made in
behalf of 'lie Southern Pacific Railroad
and its officials, who, he said, hud done
much in this rate, which was
certain 10 attract trainloads and train
loads oi people.
The ca.l was responded to heartily, as
was also another in behalf of the "plain
working members of the committee, of
whom I am one," said the speaker.
Reports were read of the corresponding
secretary, Hetta J. Reynolds; the record
ing secretary, Minnie C Lanquist, and of
the treasurer, Charles M. Whiting. The
recording secretary reported that:
The superintendent of junior work reports
thirty-niue junior and thirteen intermediate
societies, with a inenibershiD of about 1450.
Tbev arc all brim full o! enthusiasm lor
1897 and will b? very actively identified with
our work next July.
The senior societies number fifty-one, with a
membership of 1500. The press commilice
have accomplished all they noped for through
thu Golden Gate Xc-ws, enabling Endeavorers
to keep in touch with each other in all work
pertaining to the convention.
The fellowship committee aims to promote
what its namti implies, and the meetings
throughout all ihe districts nave been ver}'
successfully carried on. * â¦ â¢
The work of the union is^prcgressing in all
brnnehes and the individual societies are
busy perfecting their plans for the entertain
ment of our guests in July.
The corresponding secretary, in her re
port, referred to the Japanese society
and the three Chinese societies, who
would probably be an interesting object
lesson to the visitors.
The president of the union, Purcell
Rowe, presided at the meeting, and ad
dresses were made by Rev. R. F. Coyle
and Rev. H. M. Hoyt.
A special edition of the Golden Gate
News, the organ of the union, formed the
printed programme, and the ushers wore
the white caps that will distinguish the
reception aids during the convention.
MRS. HOPPER AS A SWIMMER.
People who were taking an afternoon outing at the Sutro Baths yesterday
afternoon were considerably surprised by the entrance of a formidable-looking
giant, accompanied by a dainty little creature at whom the aforesaid j:iant
glanced adoringly Ironi time to time. Th y disappeared into the maze of bath
rooms, but soon they were again esp.e !, this time in the water, whera
the contrast seemed all the greater, and af er much bard staring tuoy
were discovered to bs Mr. and Mr.-. De Wolf Hopper. Little Edna Wnllnco
Hopper proved herself to be a most iible swimmer, taking several high divus
with evident satisfactiou, and she apparently enjoyed every moment she was in
the water. The stars did not stay in long, but the crowd waited around until the
tall actor and his wife once more started back to the City. They created quite
a sensation.
SHOWERS OF EGGS
FOR SOCIALISTS
They Have a Nasty Expe
rience on Grant
Avenue.
Yelks and Shells Bespatter a
Large Gathering of Spec
tators.
Miscreants Br; ak Up a Meeting
Where Political Economy Was
B ing Discus ci.
j.
For the first time in many years in this
City a public meeting was broken up by a
shower of eggs. This disgraceful inci
dent happened last evening at a street
meeting of speakers of the Socialist Labor
parly, who assembled on Graiii;avenu>-,
near the junction of O'Farrell and flJarket
streets. The last time that such a thing
happened was wiien the Salvation Army
first made its appearance in this City.
Those who threw the hen-fruit last
evening were as much of a mystery to the
besmeared crowd as the identity of the
man who struck William Patterson. Had
the egg-throwers been caught their nore
would have been mixed with the broken
shells and yelks that clung to the viclims'
coats and bespattered me sidewalks.
Several weeks ago the socialists renewed
their street meetings and their favorite
places lor gathering have been on Sixth
and Market, Pine and Kearny and Grant
avenue and O'Farrell street. Twice a week
they have held forth in these places discuss
ing their doctrines and their theories upon
matters of political economy. On every
occasion they have gathered large crowds.
L.ast evening fully 400 people assembled
around the socialist speakers, W. Costley,
WÂ« Ediin, A. Appel, and matters went on
swimmingly until a patent medicine ven
der drove up in an open liack He took
up his position on t he opposite side of the
thoroughfare and began h;s usual
harangue.
It happened that the crowd was more
interested in socialism than in the wares
the other had to seil, so he pulled his team
in near to the crowd. This, of course,
caused some feeling on the part of the ;o
ciaiist speakers, who at last took personal
notice of their rival's presence, and a
lively exchange of verbal shots took place
iroiu both sides.
This amused the crowd hugely and oth
ers joined the gathering, until the street
was blocked with people. A po:icemun
strolled up, but passed on along his beat,
as there was no disturbance. A Jew min
utes after he was out of sik?ht a white ob
ject whizzed through the air and landed
upon Socialist Costiey's cheek. It was the
first e^g, and the speaker was besmeared
lrom head to foot.
Some of the crowd laughed and others
hooted and hissed as me unfortunate
Costley gave place to another speaker,
while he went away to ciean off the
debris. A little later another egg went
into the crowd, striking a spectator on he
shoulder and spattering over half a dozen
others near by. Curses became loud and
long.
The fusillade of e^-gs was kept up at in
tervals until over two dozen had found
targets in the crowd, which oegan to thin
out rapidly. Women ta well as men were
the victims and the meeting was obliged
to adjourn without the formality of a mo
tion.
Messengers were sent for the police, but
none could be found. Efforts were made
by the socialists to locate the offenders,
but to no purpose. This much was known,
that all of the eggs were thrown from the
west side of the street, ana not a few were
hurled out of ihe windows of the tali build
ings over the saloon and cigar-stand.
Strange to say, the patent medicine
seller and those immediately surrounding
his vehicle escaped without being in ike
least bespattered, and Â«fcir the socialists
and their crowd dispersed he continued
his addrtfs unmolested. The socialists
attach much importance to this feature.
They are not discouraged, but will resume
their open-air propaganda work without
considering last evening's egg-throwing
experience.

NAGLE AGAIN
ASSAILS BARRY
Exciting Episode That Oc
curred on a Street-
Car.
The R9tort Discourteous Ex
changed Between the Two
Men.
Judge Terry's Slayer Cal'ed a Hir^d
Assassin and a S utliern
Pacific Ti.uj.
As the outcome of the "roast" to which
David Naele was submitted some time
aeo in the Star, published by James H.
Barry, there was an exciting scene on a
Devisadero-street car on Tuesday, between
the two men named. This was the second
episode that has resulted from the publi
cation in question.
In each case Nagle was the aggressor,
according to eye-witnesses, and his resent
ment has apparently not moderated,
though the "roast" was applied several
months ago.
On the latest occasion Nagle was on the
car seated on the side of the dummy away
from the sidewalK, when Barry boarded
the car at the corner of Hayes street, on
his way downtown.
According to one who was aboard the
dummy at the time Nagle, on seeing his
old-time enemy, began using abusive lan
guage, directed against him. As soon as
the editor ol the Star comprehended the
situation he shouted to Nagle: "Shut up,
you blackguard; you hired assassin, shut
up."
Nngle arose and in a threatening man
ner approached Barry, who kept his seat
and continued: "You hired Southern
Pacific thug, you have threatened to kill
me; you have killed others. Now kill."
The Southern Pacific employe came a
step or two nearer and said: "Be careful
what you say," adding some vile language
and epithets.
"I will say whatever I please," replied
the journalist, "both by word of mouth
and in public print"
Nagle promptly invited Barry to get
off the car and fight, but the latter an
swered tnat he was not "engaged in tfce
business of fijthting skunks."
Matters subsided until Nagle left the
car at Leavenwortb street. As ho was
about to do so he said something about
Barry not printing anything about him
in bis paper.
To this Barry rejoined : "Whenever such
a creature as you can dictate the policy of
my paper and keep a tine out or put a line
in I ought to be dead."
In the course of the exchange of unpleas
antries Barry took occasion to inform his
adversary that he, Nagle, was a gunfighter
and that he probably thought on account
of hi; reputation that he could kill any
man, and added, "You have killed the
last man you ever will and live."
An attempt was mad*- to find Nagle last
night, but he was not at home. Barry
whs seen at his office late last night and
confirmed in substance the occurrence as
related.

ftn 9/ Dyspepsia starts
fcgw with indigestion, and
I JWÂ» may lead to almost
\_*4F ' ,^ *" anything. Indiges-
tion means a variety
of thing 3 âit shows itself in many ways.
At first, perhaps a little heaviness in the
stomach, a little sourness, windy belchings
and heartburn. Headaches begin to come
pretty soon after that, and biliousness and
a foul taste in the mouth in the morning.
Chronic constipation is almost inevitable,
and it is probably the most serious trouble
that ever takes hold of a man. Its seeming
simplicity is the thing that makes it most
dangerous, ' because it leads to neglect
Constipation means that the body is hold-
ing poisonous, impure matter that should
be gotten rid of. The poison is being re-
absorbed into the blood and the whole body
is being filled with it. Impurity in the
blood may lead to almost any disease.
There is no telling what may come of it.
Constipation is the start of it all. And yet
people are careless about it. It is the most
serious thing in the world, and the easiest
to cure if you go about it right. Dr. Pierces
Pleasant Pellets cure constipation. Cure
it positively, certainly, infallibly. Cure it
so it stays cured. Cure it so you can stop
taking medicine.
And that is something that no othex
remedy in the world will do.
