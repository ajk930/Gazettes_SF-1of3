UNFORTUNATES.
Madame Porgas, a Philadelphia
Heiress, Lost Her Life in the
Flamesâ The Countess de
Castellane Not One of
the Missing.
PARIS, Ff.anoe, May s.â The burning
of the Grand Bazaar de Chaiue yesterday
was more terrib.e than any catastrophe
that has occurred on the Continent since
the burning of the Ring Theater in Vi
enna in November, 1881, where 800 lives
were lost. At 10 o'clock this morning the
bodies of sixty-seven victims had been
identified, and forty-four others whic:i had
been taten out of the ruins were still un
claimed and unidentified.
Margaret Hogan, a niece of Mayor
Strong of New York, was one of four
ladies who was assisting the Duchesse
d'Alencon at her stall at the bazaar. She
was the oi:ly one of the four who escaped.
She was just going to tne farther end ol
the hall with the duchesse when the cry of
"Fire!" wa^ raised. She remembers noth
ing that happened afterward, except be
ing dragged by the hair from beneath a
pile of women and children in front of
the burning building. She is completely
prostrated and confined to her bed.

[Beprodnetd from a picture taken just, ajter her marriage.]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
Miss Hogan's mother arrived a few
minutes before the catastrophe. Seeing
the crowds awaiting admission she left,
intending to return later.
Mrs. F. B. Gilmore of New York had a
narrow escape. She was a saleswoman
with Mme. Costa Beauregard. Suddenly
a servant cried: "Madame, sauvez vous!
Voila le feu!" (Madam, save yourself!
Fire!) Mrs. Gilmore preserved her cool
ness and hastened to the main entrance,
where the peoDle were already falling in
the crush. She saw the danger of b?ing
trampled and quickly rushed to the rear
and escaped to the street with others
through a window.
Other Americans had marvelous escapes.
Several Brazilians and Mexicans are in
jured or missing.
More than 140 of the dead had been ac
counted for up to evening. Dr. Nachtol,
director of ambulances, says that this
gives a very inexact idea of the total who
lost their lives. He declares that dozens
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, MAY 6, 1897.
Interior of the Building in Which the Bazaar Was Held* It Represented a Street in Medieval Paris*
of persons were completely calcined.
Workingmen in large numbers are busy
searching the ruin*, being protected from
danger by portions of the fallen metal
roof, which has been shoved up.
The Due d'Alancon, who was himself
injured in getting out of the burning
building, remained near the scene all
night waiting lor some definite informa
tion with regard to the Duches3e, who is
numbered among the missing. The Due
was finally Dersuaded to leave this morn
ing, the search for the body of the Duchesse
having proved so far fruitless.
A wedding-ring was found in the ruins
this morning. It bears this insciption:
"September 28, 1&68. Ferdinand d'Or
leans to bophie Charlotte de Bavaria."
Immediately after the finding of the
wedding-ring a silver ring and a watch
with a gold ornament were picked up, and
these were identified by a servant as
having been worn by the Duchesse yester
day. Soon after the body of the Duchesse
d'Alencon was recovered. The maid ex
amined the body carefully. The head
was burned to a cinder and most of the
clothing was gone. The maid identified
the lady by a fragment of stocking. To
make the identification more absolute the
dentist of the Duchesie was summoned.
He finally identified the body by gold
fillings in the teeth and other signs.
When it was established beyond doubt
that the body was that of the Duchess it
was placed upon a bier, around which the
family domestics fell on their knees and
offered prayer* for the dead. The scene
was very impressive and the attendant
priests were moved to tears.
Throughout the night immense crowds
surrounded the Palace d'lndustrie where
the recovered bodies were deposited, ana
the numbers increased as the night wore
on. Very few of the friends of the miss
ing ones were admitted until 6 o'clock
this morning. A strong cordon of police
kept order.
General Munier, who was badly injured,
died in the hospital last night. He suc
ceeded in fighting his way out of the
burning building with his clothing afire.
On getting outside he threw himself into
a watering trough in the stable yard op
posite, but he was so badly burned that
he could not survive the shock.
President Faure visited the injured this
morning and redeied every assistance
possible.
Dime. Flores, wife of the Minister from
Ecuador, who died in the hospital last
night, expired just as her husband reached
her bedside.
The following description of the conduct,
of the Sisters of Mercy who perished in
the flames is given by ono of their num
ber who succeeded in getting out of the
burning building:
"Tfae last I saw of my companions they
were clinging together and crossing them
selves, making no effort to escape. As I
was trying to make my way to an exit a
lady whose veil was in flames clasped me
in her arms and kissed me, saying: 'Come.
sister, we will go to beaveir-together.' I
got away from her and escaped. She re
mained iii the building and was burned to
death."
The identification of the victims of the
bazaar disaster proceeded throughout the
afternoon and late to-night. Thirty bodies
lyine in the Palais d'lndustrie are as yet
unidentified. No Americans have been
four.d among the victims thus far except
those who had been living in France for
many years and regarded France as their
country. Mme. Theodore Forges, one of
the victims, was formerly Miss Weiss
we iller of the United States.
The report that Monsignor C!ari, Papal
Nuncio, perished in the fire turns out to
have been incorrect. The Nuncio to-day
sent a long dispatch to the I'ope, inform
ing him of the details of the catastrophe,
and in reply received a message stating
that his Holiness was profoundly affected.
Cardinal Richard, Archbishop of Paris,
who has been visiting Rome, left that
city and is returning to Paris.
At a special meeting of the Cabinet this
evening, attended by President Faure, all
of the Ministers in the City were present.
The President read telegrams of nympathy
which had been received from foreign
rulers. The messaee from Emperor Wil
liam began, "Allow me to share in the
mourning into which Paris and the whole
f France have been plunged."
It concluded, "May God comfort all un
happy ones now weeping for lives dear to
them."
Minister Hanotaux of Foreign Affairs
announced that all of the diplomats in
Paris had visited the Foreign Office to
offer condolences.
The Government has decided to hold a
memorial service in the Cathedral of
Notre Dame for the unknown dead and
for any of the victims whose relatives de
sire to share cherein. President Faure
will attend the services, at which Cardi
nal Richard will officiate. The Govern
ment will ask Parliament to grant a credit
for the relief of any necessitous relatives
of the dead.
President Faure has canceled all social
engagements for the week. Several Min
isters who were in the country returned to
the city as soon as they heard the news of
the disaster.
The Minister of Justice communicated
to his colleagues to-night the first results
of tbe inquiry into the causes of the fire.
The investigatinc magistrate, M. Bertolu,
reports that there was great carelessness
and imprudence in the principal arrange
ments for the bazaar.
Mgr. Clari, the Papal Nuncio, who had
attended to pronounce his blessing upon
the bazaar, says he was talking to
Duchesse d'Alencon at 3:50 o'clock. He
adds:
"Around me was a group of blind
children. Several of these must have
perished. My heart is bleeding to think
of all these poor creatures. It is too hor
rible to speak of. My nerves are in a ter
rible state."
Vicomte Damas identified his wife's
body by a piece of hair cloth, which she
wore next to her skin as a member of the
Third Order of St. Frances.
Former Consul-General S. E. Morris,
who is awaiting the arrival of his suc
cessor, has been unremitting in his en
daavors to learn if there were any Ameri
cans in the fire. He made searches in the
American colony and inquiries elsewhere,
and said in an interview to-day:
"I; was singularly fortunate that there
was only one American victim. This was,
indeed, remarkable, because just now
there is an unusually lar^e number of
Americans in Paris. They are generous
supporters of such fetes as the grand
Bazaar de Chsrite; and, moreover, it gave
them a favorable opportunity for getting
into close quarters with tho aristocracy and
many of the celebrities of Paris.
"Mme. Porges was the only American
victim. She was Miss Weisweiller. Her
daughter accompanied her to the bazaar
and escaped uninjured. The Porches fam
ily reside at Vienna. The rumor that
Cora tense Castellane was among the miss
ing is untrue."
M. Jean Raffaelli, the painter, says:
"My daughter bad the mark of heels
stamped into her back. She was trampled
in a heap at the door near the main en
trance. Her mother tried to pull her
from the blazing fire; bat she said, 'It is
useless. Save yourself, as I shall die in
THE PALAIS DE INLUSTRIF, Where ths Bodies of the Dead Awa t Identification.
any case.' Her mother replied, 'I shall
not leave you. I will take you or stay
and die with you.' Both escaped, though
severely injured."
The mother of the four-year-old child,
Alfred David, one of the victims, arrived
during the day for the purpose of taking
the body away with her. It was decided,
however, that it was impossible to show
her the ghastly remains of her child.
When this news was communicated to
the unfortunate mother, in a}paFoxysm of
grief she tried to force her way into the
mortuary hall, screaming, "I will see my
child !"
Eventually it was found necessary to
forcibly remove the poor woman. Mme.
David lost her husband a month ago and
her only other child died two weeks ago.
Priests accompanied each group of
mourners and very gradually the mort
uary hall was relieved of its ghastly con
tents. The resources of pombes funebres
have been taxed to their utmost, all

hearses and carriages being in constant
nse.
The fact that the faces ana heads of the
victims were so horribly charred and dis
figured is explained by the fact that the
capes worn were generally of flimsy ma
terial and were the first articles of apparel
to catch tire.
An eye-witness describes the scene as
follows:
"The women mostly wore light cos
tumes and those who escaped from the
furnace were screaming 'Fire I Help I'
The faces of many of them were covered
with blood. From time to time children
ran out of the burning building crying
foi their mothers. A number of women
of the poorer classes standing in the
crowd at the risk of burning themselves
tore flaming clothing from the persons of
the fnd;es as the latter dashed in terra*
through the streets.
"The bazaar at that moment was noth
ing more or less than a huge br..zier. as
the heat was unbearable we made our way
to some vacant ground between the bazaar
and Convent of Rue Bayard and joined a
handful of workmen who were trying to
rescue people from the flames by means of
a ladder too short to avail much. While
the work of rescue was in progress,
heartrending cries from the rear attracted
us. Two women who had just escaped
from the flames were lying writhing on tba
ground just beyond the margin of fire.
We darted in that direction, and as we
neared them pieces of burning debris fell
in showers upon our heads and we were
unable to reach these unfortunates, who
were then burning like torches. They
had ceased to stir and they soon entirely2
disappeared in the flames and the wit
nesses of this awful scene moaned and
wept.
"The awful drama was then at its % height.
In tne midst of hissing, cracking flames
heard the shrieks of victims, but they
were epeediiy stifled. Seeing the hope
lessness of attempung to save the bazaar,
the firemen turned their attention to the
adjoining convent, up tne walls of which
the flames were leaping. In a few mo
ments tiie bazaar collapsed with a frightful
crash, envelopinc the vicinity in flaming
debri*. I was then aD'e to approach it.
'On all sides were bodies, many of them
stretcned on their backs, with arms ex
tended as though appealing for help.
Others were still burning, their bodies
emitting a crackliag sound and a sicken
ing odor. The space in which we w<?re
standing was speedily invaded by despair
ing crowds of relatives, some of whom
had to be forcibly prevented from leaping
into the flames. It was impossible then
to find those wnom they sought in the
heap of shriveled limbs, twistad bodies
and blackened, grinning faces."
The bazaar was situated opposite the
Kothscliild stables. Gamard, a groom in
the employ of the Rothschilds, witnessed
the whole scene. He says:
"At 4:20 yesterday afternoon I saw the
Comtes-e de Reese rush into ihe street
from the bazaar shouting 'Firel' I looked
up and saw nothing but a little smoke
rising from the structure, and I could not
tnink why the woman waÂ» in such a fright,
when suddenly 1 heard a confused mur
mur, deepening into a roar. Then the
roof of the bazaar burst into flames like
a box of matches. Initantly there tss a
terribie rush of reople like a wave into
the street. Fearful frror was depicted
on each face. The hair of some was
burning.
"There was such a rush from the inside
of the building to the door that tea
women fell in a heap on the pavement,
and uose following piled on top, crush
ing and bruising the helpless ones.
Women shrieked with agony.
"I rushed out and tried to lift some of
them up, but was driven back by the
frenzied crowd following. Many of them
threw themselves on the ground and
rolled over from side to side in their at
tempts to stifle the flames. One lady
reached the streets in safety and then,
noticing that her child was lost, she
forced her way back, biting and scratch
ing like a mad creature, and succeeded
in re-entering the furnace. She never
again emerged.
"Men with their hair and beards in
flames came out among the women. Gen
eral Meunier, with his clothes ablaze and
in great agony, rushed into the courtyard
in front of the stables and plunged into a
trough of water. Forty persons sought
refuge in Baron Rothschild's house. La
dies with their dresses in flames rolled
upon the stones of the couttyard, utterine
frightful jhneks.
"I fetched a hose and turned water on
the burning Deople, and so saved several
of them from being roasted alive. I also
assisted several women who wera almost
naked, their clothing having been burned
or torn off their bodies, in reaching the
Hospital Beaujon. According to my esti
mate barely five minutes elapsed between
the time when I went to the hospital and
the time when I returned, when the ba
zaar was no longer in existence."
Mrs. William Astor left the bazaar a
quarter of an hour before the conflagra
tion.
Miss Fane, a sister of Frederic* Fane,
on American residing in Rue Prony, who
was almost totally deaf, was in the center
of the building when the fire broke out.
Her escape was largely due to her in
firmity. She saw the fire without hearing
the tumult ensuing on the discovery and
made her way to an exit, being among
the first to reach it.
The Baroness de Selliers, formerly Mrs.
L vermore, of New York, also reached the
door among the first.
In comparatively few instances of suf
focation the features are placid, those of
Mme. Jacque being almost pleasant in her
sudden sieep of death. In the list of dead
are found no country visitors yet, but it is
certain there was a large contingent, not i
only from provincial chateaux, bat from
Belgium.
The Countess de Castellane, at first !
thought to be among the dead, had been i
invited to be present at the bazar yester
day, but owing to her having attended a
Charitable fete in Rue de Sieze the day be
fore she put off her visit until to-day. To
this she probably owea her life.
Consul-General Morss was passing near
Kue Jena, riding on a bicyc/e, when the
cry of fire was raised. He leit the ma
chine in the street and devoted himself
all night to assisting the firemen. Mr.
Whitney of Boston, an old volunteer fire
man, who is now living in Paris, also as
sisted the firemen in the work of rescue
until daybreak.
One mystery is now cleared. The vic
tims were besmeared with flaming tar
and other inflammable compounds drop
ping from the roof, and this was why
there was no prelude of asphyxia. The
women were singei by licking flames and
literally burned alive, as would-be res
cuers cobbed and wrung their bands in
powerless despair. This accounts also for
the terrific phenomen of bursting bodies
full of blood and life only a few seconds
before.
The unidentified bodies as well as the
jewels recovered from the debris hayÂ«Â»
been photographed.
Among the last to escape from the burn
ing building was Baronne de Reuter, for
merly Miss Beatrice Potter of Philadel
phia.

NEW YORK, N. V., May 5. -The Her

after tbe tire:
The Rue Jean Qoujon was almost im
passable. Of the bazaar building, in
which only a few hours before everything
had been gay and beautiful, there re
mained only a few charred poles. Inside
the wrecked building there was nothine
but pieces of rags, wood and human re
mains.
The firemen were digging among the
cebris in search of the bodies. There were
rot enough ambulances, and the bodies
had to be placed in wraps. Then tame
soldiers, police and firemen to carry av.oy
tbe dead, and they all worked in silence
and with a will.

from L'Hospital Beaujon also with sheets
waiting to cover up the dead before they
were taken away in ambulances.
When I arrived the men were tearing
away aeDris ue^r the western wall, which
bounded what had beeu the bÂ«aar.
There the bodies were literally found
piled in heaps and their position seemed
to indicate That a terror-stricken rush had
taken place-or was it an instinctive hud
dling together in the face of death?
I saw spools of thread, which had
doubles fallen out of some lady's work
bag There were pieces of underskirts all
over the ruins and fragments of woolen
garments and corset covers. The tiny
little slippers were everywhere to be seen,
crisp but entire, only charred by the heat.
Fragments of bodies were so thickly
strewn around that one had to walk very
carefully for fear of stepping on portions
of the remains. Those codies that I saw
pulled out were almost invariably burned
at the head and feet, and the arms, too,
were generally terribly charred. Moot of
the bodies I saw had the head burst quite
A iittle book at my feet was half burned,
but 1 saw the title, "Eucyclopedie dcs
Ouvroges dcs Dames." Oa one side was
a pile of valuables, jewels, etc., guarded
by policemen. I sftw little metallic purses,
some of gold. There were bracelets and
rings completely free from flesh, showing
how terrible had been the Uames in their
fury. Then I saw reticules, some com
paratively intact.chains, locfcets.pincenez,
watches. One watch I noticed had stopped
at half-past 4.
Mile, le Comte of 22 Rue Jean Goupn
said: "The tire broke out at half-past i.
o'clock. It was terribly sudden. The
haat was worse than the smoke. You
could not go out into the street for fear of
the heat The bazaar burned up just as
if the wood had been soaked with kero
sene. I should think there were 3500 peo
ple there, because, you know, the Nuncio
was there during the afternoon, ana that
Ide it an extra attraction.
He had hardly leit when the flames
â¢st out. They seemed to spring up
tn ali over. They shot up clear into the
and the heat was thrown out on all
us. So tierce was it that all the win
dows and shop fronts opposite were
! cracked or burst open. Birds in the win
dows dropped dead from their perches as
if struck by lightning, and many of the
neighbors were so paralyzed with lear
that they did not know what to do.
"The tire lasted only about twenty min
utes, but such r twenty minutes I shall
never forget. Women ran shrieking into
the street and fell dead in the roadway,
overcome by the heat and burning from
head to foot."
I found among the dead Mme. Kahn,
cousin of the Lord Mayor of London, of
Sir Campbel, and Lady Clarke and Sir R.
Lawson.

VIENNA, Austria, May s.â Empress
Elizabeth is completely prostrated by the
tragic death of her sister, the Duchesse
d'Alenccn, who died in yesterday's fire at
Paris. She remains in her room, ad
mitting nobody and refusing to teke focd.
As if foreboding something, the Em
press asked for her papers earlier than
usual, but the ladies in attendance shrank
from producing them, making excuses.
Her Majesty, however, obtained them
somehow and tie shi.ck was terrible.
There is serious apprehension for her deli
cate health.

alarmed friends and relatives of American
travelers who are supposed to be in Paris.
The rumor that Countess Castellane, for
merly Auna Gould, was in the building
at the time of the fire are not generally
credited here, although George Gould said
to-day that as many of his friends had
booths at the bazaar ha thought it ex
tremely likely that she had one too.
"We are not worrying, however," said
Gouid, "because if anything had hap
pened to sister I should have heard by
this time, 1 am sure. Ifine was even
missine we should have he^rd, so I don't
think there is any occasion for me to
worry."
The Vicoratesse d'Avenel who was in
jured in the Paris fire is a daughter of the
late James Meinel, formerly a leather
merchant here. He had three daughters
and all married titles. These were Laura,
who married the Vicorate d'Avenel
twenty years aso, and who has since
lived in Paris; Nina, who became Vicom
tesse de la Tournelle, and Augusta, who
married the Baron de Vlenck. Ail three
girls were conspicuous in society nere and
Laura was a linguist and musician of
ability. Her husband, Vicomte d'Avenel,
has a large estate in a suburb of Paris and
is a famous horticulturist, his collection
being among the finest in France. He ia
a contributor to the leading French peri
odicals and recently published a series of
articles on economics in the Revue dcs
Deux Mondes.
Mme. Uoskir and Mme. Roland-Gosse
lin, second daughter of Mme. HosKir,
who lost their lives in the fire, were aunt
and cousin, respectively, of H. C. Hoskir
of the banking bouse of L. yon Hoffman
& Co. of this city. Mme. Hoskir's husband
is the bead of the Pans banking house of
Hoskir <fc Co., whose New YorK correspon

ana was on his way to St. Petersburg at the
time of the fire. M. Roland-Gosselin is

Mme. Hoskir's third daughter and Mme.
Pierre GiroJ, another relative of H. C.
Hoskir, were also in the bazaar, but

Why the Police Supervision of the
Charity Bazaar Was In
adequate.
LONDON. Eng , May s.â There is a dis
position to censure M. LÂ«pine, Prefect of
tha Paris Police, for lack of police super
vision and inspection of buildings. Ac
cording to a dispatch received by the
Daily News Lepine's excuse it that the
patrons and patronesses of the bazaar
were all reactionists, and be feared to
meddle lest he be accussed of trying to
suppress a Catholic enterprise. Moreover,
many of the organizers of the fair were
Rallies whom the Government wished to
oblige. It may be said that the tire pre
vented the loss of thousands of lives at
the coming international exhibition,
where the same inflammable and unsuit
able model of old Paris would probably
have been erected.
The papers teem with interesting narra
tives by survivors and eye-whnesses.
The Times publishes an interview which
its Paris correspondent had with the
Duches-se d'Uzes. She said:
"The first gleam of fire came from a
spot but a short distance from where I
was standing. I was dazzled, so swiltly
did the flames spread. 1 can compare it
only to the bursting of a rocket. There
was no such thing in my case as reaching
the main entrance, but near me was a
small door leading to a waste piece of
ground behind the bazaar structure. I
dnsb d through this and was soon in the
open air, though ntiil in an lnclosure. I
had p.isseJ, as it were, under an archway
of riime?, but was only slightly burned.
The hair above my left temple was
singed."

7HURSTON PREDICTS RUIN.
Says Abrogation of the Hawaiian Treaty
Means Disaster to the Islands'
Business Interests.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May s.â Not a
few Hawaiians here were taken somewhat
by surprise when they learned of the ac
tion of the Senate Finance Committee in
striking out of the tariff bill the clause
exempting Hawaiian imports from the
operations of the act. It is believed, how
ever, that the committee's action will be
neeatived by the Senate, as under both
the McKinley and Wilson bills an attempt
was made to abrogate the reciprocity
treaty, and each time it failed in the
Senate.
The opinion is expressed that the dis
cussion on this matter will naturally pre
cipitate a debate on the annexation ques
tion. This will result in the latter not
being treated on its merits and in a man
ner which its itnportanca demands.
Favorable action by the Senate on the
committee's report, it is felt, might tend
to jeopardize what prospects for annexa
tion now exist. Minister Hatch refuses
to talk.
Thurston, who is now here on s special
mission, said the abrogation of the treaty
meant disaster and ruin to the business
interests of the islands. He said he had
information that the Republicans on the
committee were not a unit in striking out
the exemption clause, and he hoped it
would be restored.
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.
Japan Does Not W.sh to Trouble This
Government With /ts Hawai.an
Island Grievances.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May s.â Mail
from Consul-General Mil!s at Honolulu
received at the State Department to-day
contains no reference to the reported ex
| niiement about the attitude of Japan.
Ftom this Secretary Sherman believes
, that the alarm of the Hawaiian Govern
j mem has abated. According to the state-
I meist Riven out by the Japanese Minister
I Here, his Government is dbposed to settle
; the controversy over tho refusal to allow
Japanese immigrants to land without re
course to a threatening naval demonstra
tion. The State Department is hopeful
that no trouble calliiiÃ for intervention by
! the United States will result. The pres
ent intention, however, of the adminis
tration is to have at least two warships
there until all danger of Japanese inter
j lerf nee has passed.

Mills of Texas Points Out One of
the Crave Possibilities of
Ratification.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May s.â After
more than three months' wrang ing the
Senate to-day by a vote of 43 to 26â nine
votes short of the necessary two-thirds â
rejected the general treaty of arbitration
with Great Britain. Debate on the treaty
was bagun on February 2, and the process
of amendment has continued at inter
vals until a vote was taken this afternoon.
Before the vote Miils of Texas mado a
strong speech against ratification, his
principal objection being 10 the eighth
article of the treaty, which defines terri
torial claims that mi^ht be made. He
tiled as an instance ihe possible purchase
of Cuba by Great Britain, which would be
in direct contravention to the Monroe
doctrine, yet under the terms of the
treaty we would be compelled to submit
this or any other question regarding
acquisition of territory to arbitration.
The suggestion that furtner amendment
might be offered was met by the objection
that the amendment stage had passed.
Hoar urged ratification, and was fol
lowed by Carter of Montana in opposi
tion.
Chandler closed the debate with an ap
peal for ratification. At 4 o'clock, accord
ing to a previous agreement, a vote was
taken. It occupied more than the usual
time owing to the difficulties of pairing
one Senator in oppo ition against two
who favored ratification.
The vote was not made public, but as
near as can be ascertained those who
voted in the negative are: Allen, Bacon,
Berry, Butler, Carter, Chilton, Cockrell,
Daniel, Hansbrough, Harris of Kansas,
Harris of Tennessee, Heitfeld. Jones of
Arkansas, Kyle, Mason, Mills, Morgan,
Penrose, Pettigrew, Pettus, Pritchard,

ISCLISEIt '!<â¢ IK SARCASTIC.
RepubHeant Say ... Amended Tariff
Kill Canno' Bn%B the tiouie.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May s.â Some
of the Republican members of the House
are very sarcastic in reference to the tariff
bill to be reported to the Senate.
Grosvenor of Ohio, a member of the
Ways and Means Committee, and quite
generally regarded as a spokesman of the
administration, says the b U as at present
framed can never pass ttie House. But
Grosvenor may be mistaken.
It was learned to-day tbat the Repub
lican Senators have already outlined the
plan they wiil follow in passing the bill. I
Their plau is to keep tQe bill before the j
Senate constantly alter it is called up for |
consideration on the 18th, and by be^in- I
ning daily sessions at an early hour and '
continuing them at night to complete the
consideration of the bill if possible before i
the end oi the fiscal year.
â¢ The bill will then be sent to the House,
and if a conference committee is asked
the Senate will decline to appoint and
the House will thus be forced to the neces
sity of accepting the Senate bill or pro
longing the contest indefinitely, witn a
prospect of having no bill at all.
This is not intonded to antagonize the
! House, but simply to adopt a plan oi
passing the bill without reference to a
conference committee as the only practi
cal method of disposing of it and avoid
ing the interminable discussion which
would result if any other course were
followed.
In explanation of their action in strik
ing out the entire reciprocity clause the
Republicans claim that this clause wi-1
be brought up in the Senate in the shape
of a general amendment cevering tne
general question of reciprocity, and that
undoubtedly some reciprocity provision
will be adopted.
Aldrich, author of the reciprocity clause
in the McKinley tariff bill in 1890. will
undoubtedly bring forward provisions
based ou the lines of that luw, but prob
ably more general in their application.
It is apparently the opinion ot the ma
jority of the Republican Senators that an
amendment will be adopted continuing
the Hawaiian treaty. It is explained fur
ther that in striking out of the bill the
clause declaring that the treaty shall not
be abrogated, the Republican Senators
are actuated only by a de.sire that the
I question shall come up on it; merits in
stead of a somewhat inappropriate amend
ment to the bUgar schedule.
The Democrats are still sweeping in
their denunciation of the bill, but are not
yet prepared to oppose it in all particulars.

Secure* an Appropriation for tho Itn
prorrment nf I' ear I Harbor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May s.â Deboe,
the newly elected Senator from Kentucky,
was sworn in this morning, after which
the sundry civil appropriations bill was
taken up.
An amendment appropriating $150,000
lor Pearl harbor, Hawaii, was offered by
Morgan and objected to on a point of order
by Al ison, who said that be sympathized
with the Senator from Alabama, but there
was no use in puttinn the item in the bill
as it had been rejected in the House last
session.
"I suppose," said Morgan, "that the
principle of locus penitentiie applies to
the House, and I hope that the House is
open to repentance on this matter."
The amendments were agreed to.
An amendment wss made to appoint a
Nicarasruan canal commission, mid dis
cubsion as to whether the commission
shouid consist of three or rive irom civil
' life or the army or navy went over till to
morrow.
An amendment was offered by Petti
grew authorizing the President 10 sus
pend the proclamation of Cleveland,
issued lajt February, retting aside nmny
millions of acres of public lands as forest
reservations and restore these lands to the
public domain.
The matter went over after some sharp
criticism from Pettierew and Carter on
the result of the Cleveland act. Carter
said this was a most gross proposition â
one which made it a criminal act for peo
ple upon a reservation to cut timber for
fuel or other us s.
The matter went over without action
and the (Senate adjourned.

WASHINGTON. D. C, May 5.-Con
sular As-ent Alger telegraphs from Puerto
Cortez, Honduras, that the revolutionists
have captured that place. Secretary Long
may send a warship there.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May sâPassen
gers from Honduras express confidence in
the success of the revolution. A large
majority of the people want De Soto as
President.
The action of the revolutionists in cat
ting down all customs duties has proved
very popular with the merchants. Bo
niila hopes for the assistance of neighbor
ing republics, but the troubles in Guate
mala have prevented all aid from that
quarter and he cannot count on the na
tives. Americans to a man are with the
revolutionists.
The commander of the revolutionist
armyâ Drummond â is an American, not
an Englishman, as at first reported, and
of the colonels there are Richardson from
Memphis and Wiltz, Maspero, Roman and
Christman of New Oleans â boys who went
into the revolution ior the fun of the
thing.
The revolutionists nre well supplied
with ammunition and clothing, which
they have captured from Government
troops. At Belize an American named
Jackson is on trial as a filibuster. He
was one of the leaders of the Honduras
revolutionists. It is charged that he re
ceived arms and ammunition from Cin
cinnati concealed in bales of hay. The
arms were landed in British territory,
hence the interference of England and
tne arrest of Jackson.

Crown Prince Constantine commanded
the infantry, which stood its ground
against the charge of the Ottoman in

army, which fought a duel with two
Turkish batteries. The gallantry of the
two Princes excited much enthusiasm
among the troops.
Tne Turkish line of battle formed at

ATHENS, Gkeece, May s.â An official
telegram received this evening confirms
the reports of the Turkish repulse at
Pharsala. Crown Prince Constantine and
Prince Nicholas acted in a most courageous
manner, risking their lives a hundred
times. Their valor was enthusiastically
acclaimed by the whole army after the

warmest congratulations to the Princet.
The King and the Government issued a

Major Pallis, chief of staff in Tuessa!y
has telegraphed to the Government the
main facts concerning the fighting at
Pharsala, The dispatch concludes:
"We maintain all our positions. The
engagement will certainly be continued
to-morrow. Ttie enemy's numbers are

Oreeh Engineer* Try a f'oinjion id of
Marrelou* Fore.
BOSTON, Mass.. May s.â Coffins Beach.
Gloucester, a safe, secluded waste of de
serted coast line, was to-day the
pcsne cf some remarkable experiments
with a marvelous new explosive which
may be destined to yet cnange tne com
plexion of the Graeco-Turkish war. A
mysterious party, including a prominent
Greek engineer from New Yorfc and mem
bers of the Henchagist, a Cretan revo
lutionary society, repaired to the scene
with teams loaded with the explosive and
apparatus.
In holes thirty yards apart forty-nou nd
lots of the stuff were planted, with ful
minating caps connected by heavy in
sulated wire with a loop a mile long for
safety. When it was ignited by electri
city the whole beach arose in the air one
mass of sand, while the earth trembled
and the water arose and fell several inches.
The second experiment was with a
triple quantity, buried deeper and covered
with lops and several hundred weight of
stone. When it explosed it seemed a
veritable earthquake. The stone was shat
tered to dust and the logs to minute
splinters.
The new explosive was demonstrated to
be a complete success. It is composed of
three parts nitro-elycerine and one part
a secret dust substance of very high ex
plosive power.
The Greek engineer sails for the seat of
war on Saturday and will take the secret
with him. His intention is to mine the
roads over which the Turkish troops will
pats.

NEW YORK, N. V.. May 5.-The Na

irramme to forti:y the organization in
California against the inroads of seces
sionists on tbe coast. The league omcers
are now determined to wage an active
campaign throughout California in order
to disrupt the opposition movement.
President Potter said to-day: "The
latest move of the North California Sun
day-racing unti-L. A. W. men came to
light this week in the form of an attempt
on the part of the seceders to criitpie the
division. Henry F. W_, nne, 11. V. Han

nent in the racing department of the
L. A. W. last year. The three combined
lorceÃ and Hancock began suit against
the division, sued oat an attacnment and
direciea the Sheriff to levy upon tha books
of the division."
This morning Potter received a telegram
from George H. Strong oi San Francisco,
accepting the appointment of chief con
sul, vice F. H. Kerrigan, resigned, and
also one from Francis Â±. Dwyer of Sacra
mento, accepting the appointment of vice
consul to succeed Wynne. Potter at once
sent Strong $200 by telegraph with in
structions tofav all proper claims against
the division and release the property
seized by the Sheriff. In response to the
card published in the L. A. W. bulletin of
April 23 President Potter is in receipt of
communications by every mail from North
California members pledging loyalty to
the L. A. W. and expressing their willing
ness to sustain it in the contention.

used in tracking criminals in this county,
is suing A. G. Frazier for the value of a

as exhibits were claimed to be Cuban
bloodhounds, but a local authority on
dogflesh, called as an expert witness, de
clared on the stand that the dogs were
foxhounds, and that there was no recog
nized breed known as Cuban bloodhounds
despite the popular idea.

HAVANA, Cuba, May s.â Christina
Herrera, a Cuban woman, was living with
her youthful son and two daughters in a
Cuban hospital, near Govea, this province,
where she acted as nurse. The hospital
was established by the Cuban leader, Bal
domero Acosta, for sick and wounded
Cubans. Acosta himself had the fever,
and, concealed between two hills, the
hospital was believed to be safe from the
Spaniards. Under that belief Acosta sent
his cousin to attack a Spanish column,
which, as he was informed, would pass
some six miles from there. Only six
soldiers remained with Acosta in the hos
pital, and besides Christina Herrera and
her children there was another nurse and
about eve women more, wives of soldiers.
A spy told the Spaniards of the exist
ence of the hospital, and a Spanish
column, 1000 .strong, attacked the place on
April 2S. Torres and his iive men, firing
rides to advise Acosta of tne proximity of
the enemy, tied io the forest.
Acoste, jumping out from his stretcher,
criea to the women to run with the
children, and stood in the door firing at
the advancing Spaniards. Acosta nar
rowly escaped, followed by those strong
enough to ran, and four women also
gained the forest.
Marta Corralies was seized by two
Spanish soldiers, but snatched a bayonet
from the belt of one and killed him.
Christina Herrera was caught by the
Spanish soldiers and driven back to the
hospital to witness the fate of twenty sick
and wounded Cubans, who were ruth
lessly slain. More than twenty perished
in their beds, pierced by Spanish bayo
nets. A Spanish soldier, a younc man
from Pontevedra, Galicia, who refused to
join in the assassination and protested
against the crime, was shot dead by a
l.eutenant.
Most cruel in the work were the irregu
lars of the guerrilla forcesâ common crim
inals from Spanish penal colonies in Africa.
After the murders and after the hospi
tal had been tired a young cirl of 10 years
was sold at auction. A captain won her
for $6 and assaulted her. The child's
mother unsuccessfully attempted to kill
herself and swooned. When she recov
ered she was told that the child had dis
appeared. The mother is now in the
Havana prison for disreputable women.
A correspondent of La Lucia saw Chrit
tina Herrera in prison and published a
report of this affair, in which tiie press
censor did not allow the facts to be men
tioned.
THE CHILDREN'S FAIR.
Kinetoscope, Animatoscaps and
Other Attractions Are
Listed.
Aa Oriental and Indian Booth Will
Bs Thereâ Punch and Judy
for the Children.
The famous picture called "The Cardi
nal's Portrait," painted by Toby Ro en
thai, has been bought by the generous art
patrons of San Franciso and loaned to
the board of managers of the Children's
Hospital, to ba exhibited at the ginger
bread fete. The ladies are highly elated
at this stroke of fortune, and expect the
hospital to reap a handsome revenue irom
the exhibition of such a masterpiece.
The picture has been upon inspection in
many of the large European cities, and
has been praised by Kadne arti3ts in the
warmest terms. In Berlin Emperor Will
iam saw it and expressed hib admiration.
In Munich n was pronounced the beat of
Ros-nthai's productions, and in the lan
guage of Kaulbach "only to be compared
to a large Meissonnier."
Sitting lor his portrait Ihe Cardinal has
fallen asleep. A book dropping from his
hand upon the fljcr has attracted the at
tention of the artist, a young monk, who
is running his hands through his hair in
perplexity and is in doubt what to do in
order not to displease the dignitary who
siis betore him.
As the Cardinal sits at the table, where
a bottle of Italian wine and a dish ol fruit
awaits his pleasure, he look^ aged and
feeble, but the half-finished portrait on
the yountr monk's easel represents a man
in the prime of youth and strength â a
mute flattery on the youthful monk's part
to one his superior in authority. The con
trast is most amusing.
Toe figures are all in a rich setting,
tapestries, carpets and all being handled
in the clever fashion that has mado Rosen
thfti's name famous.
The gingerbread fete is to be held at the
residence of Mrs. Clark Crocker, corner of
Sutter ami Ociavia streets. It will open
at 7:oO o'cloc.k Tuesday evening, May 11,
and continue until 11 o'clock, Saturday
evening, May 15.
There win tie all sorts of attractions for
young and n!d, both indoors and out, and
the only s'.range thing is that the ladies
have manaeed to crowd ao many attrac
tive features into so short a space of time.
Indoors mere will be a different booth
in many different rooms. One will be the
Orieiit.il booth, where all things Oriental
and Turkish for the gratification of ti.e
artistic sense and the gustatory neryes will
be on hand.
Then Uiere will be an Indian room, in
which such articles as Indian baskets, pot
tery, mats and other things made Dv these
children of nature will be on exhibition.
There will, of course, bo a bazaar, in
which many articles, useful and orna
mentnl, manufactured by the ladies' ileft
and willing ringers, may be found. In the
basement refreshments will be served.
The grounds will be illuminated at
night, and in the garden a big teat will be
pitched, which is to figure as the hall of
surprises. Richard Hauling has charge
of all the surprises to be contained there
in, but jealously guards them from prying
eyes till later on.
In the grounds also will be a kinetc
scone, an iinimatoscope and a shooting
gallery. Punch and Judy will be tuere
tor the children In the afternoons and
gingerbread will simply abound.
There will be a series of tableaux, which
will be a graphic education on an inter
esting subject. The taDleaux will be ar
ranged by Addison Mizner and Miss
Agnes Bates. Those particirjating will
be: Miss Marie Wells, Miss Gladys Mer
rill. Miss Cnarlotte Elhnwood, M 89 Etbel
Deane, Reed Hutchinso?!, Kailiro Barton,
Louis Bruguiere, Charles Fernald and Km
ery Sruith.
t>n the tirst afternoon Ferris Hartman
will sing his funniest songs, and on
Wednesday afternoon there will be given
g!impÂ«es of Spaiu and the Mediterranean
by Henry Payot.
It requires $2000 a month to keep the
hospital going to minister to the wants of
the numberless iittie ones that monthly
puss through its gates, and this statement
gives an idea of the noble work in which
tne ladies are engaged. Those ladies who
are riving all their time at present to this
work of humanity are as follows:
Mrs. Wendell Easton, Mrs. W. B. Harrington.

FRESNO PER JU fir CASE.
Formal Complaint Against Dr. Kc/ntosh
Will Be Filed To- Day, Following
the Court's Order.
FRESNO, Cal., May 5 âThe complaint
against Dr. G. B. Mclntosh, who was
ordered into the custody of the Sheriff
by Judge Carroll Cook for having com
mitted perjury in testifying as a hand
writing expert, m behalf of tne defendant,
at tha recent trial of Professor W. A.
Banders for forcing the name of William
Wootton, the missing Reedley rancher,
will be filed in tbe morning in Judge
Austin's court by District Attorney Snow.
The doctor has been in jail since oidered
there upon the conclusion of the trial,
being unable to furnish $5000 bail fixed
by the court. He consideis himselt a
much abused man, and says that Judge
Cook misconstrued ail testimony.
Professor Sanders is still in jail here
under the s'.ay of execution for twenty
<iays granted by the court when the sen
tence of fourteen years' imprisonment
was imposed on the man who is also be
iieved to have murJered William Wootton.

book, an important link in the evidence
of the prosecution. Judee Cook stated
that lie believed him to be guilty of hav
ing done this.
SACRAMENTO'S GRAND JURY.
Editor Sheet, an Indicted for Libel and
Two County Supervisors
Accused.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May s.â After a
protracted session of several months the
Grand Jury of Sacramento County tiled
into Judge Hart's court at a late hour this
afternoon and submitted its final report.
The document is voluminous and con
tains the usual criticisms of the various
comity institutions. It contains five ac
cusations and one indictment, the latter
being against John A. Sneehan, editor of
the Sunday News of this city, charging
bim with libel in having published arti
cles accusing the Board of Supervisors of
illegally appropriating moneys for bridge
building in this county.
The accusations are against Supervisors
Jenkins and Dreman for voting to allow
the claims of more than one newspaper in
the county for publishing election proc
lamations. Those members of the board
who were re-elected and who also voted to
allow the same claims during their former
term of office escared accusation on ihe
ground that they had gone out of office
since so voting, and the Grand Jury had
no legal right to bring accusations against
them as new members of the board for
acts done by a former board.
An accusation was presented against
Charles E. Leonard, president of the
Board of City Trustees, alleging that he
accepted a half interest in an iron safe
ownea by leaders ot the gambling fra
ternity, for which he is claimed to have
used his influence to procure the passage
of an ordinance licensing upstairs club
rooms. This ordinance was passed by the
board and vetoed by the Mayor, and was
allowed to die without any attempt being
made to pass it over the veto.
It is claimed by President Leonard's
friends that he was opposed to attempt
ing to pass the measure over the Mayor's
veto, and that the accusation will fall
Mat.
CODE COMMISSION JPLIGBT.
Bat >o Fund* n herewith to Purchase
Supplies.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May s.â From
ali appearances ihe Code Commission has
encountered a snag w.bich bids fair to
&wamp it. The law which, created the
commission failed to provide for sup
plies, and as Secretary of State Brown
has gone on record, as a member of the
Board of Examiners, to the effect that
he will not tolerate any deficiencies, and
as no deficiencies can be created without
the consent of the entire board, the com
mission is like a woodcutter without tools
and has nothing to do and no office
porter to assist in doing it.

Theft of a Woman's Purse on
a Steamship.
PORTLAND, Or. May s.â Miss Lu
cinda Holiister was robbed of her parse as
she was about to leave for Stella on the
steamship Potter last evening. In the
car that brought her from Forest Grove
were two young men who followed her to
the vessel. They proved to be Leander
Nordyke, 16 years nf age, ana his brother,
â whose home is at Gaston. Miss Holiister
incautiously laid her purse on a table in
the saloon* of the steamer, and Leander
snatcoed it and made his escape.
The young lady reported the andacioas
robbery to the police, and soon thereafter
the thief was arrested by Detectives Welsh
and Maher. Leander disclaimed having
stolen the lady's purse, but alleged that
she dropped it on the steamer, and he was
seeking the owner. The accused really
had no occasion to steal, for when searched
he had ?56 on his person, which he said
his father, a very wealthy man, cave to
him before leaving home this afternoon.
However, he plead guilty in the Munici
pal Court. He was sent to the reform
school.

MARYSVILLE, Cal., May s.â Edward
Page was fatally wounded at Indiana
ranch, thirty miles northeast of this city,
last evening at 8 o'clock by James G.
Daley, superintendent of the Good Title
Mining Company. This morning Daley
came to Marysville and swore to a com
piaint charging Pace with assault with
attempt to kill. Sheriff Donahue ascer
tained that Daley was the aggressor, apd
arrested him twelve miles from this city
on a similar charge.
Daley says that Page and himself had
trouble about the latter being ordered to
leave the mine, and Page attacked him
with a Winchester rifle. Daley, who has a
crippled arm, took the rifle from him and
threw it to the ground. Page then attacked
him from behind, and Daley, believing he
had a knife, drew a revolver and shot him
in the abdomen with fatal results.

citizens by Mexican petty officials are ac
cumulating here. The latest of these is
contained in a letter from Deputy Collec
tor of Customs ri. W. Brady, which is
dated Lochiel, April 20.
While speaking of other flagrant wrongs
Mr. Brady calls particular attention to
the case of Toney O'Donnell, the stock
man who, while looking alter his cattle a
short distance over the line, was seized by
Mexican officials and hurried off to the
Masrdaiena Bastile. Here he has been
contined since the 17ih of April, without
any charge being preferred or examina
tion accorded, and if kind Providence
does not intervene in his behalf he is
likely to remain there for many months.
The outrages complained of by Mr.
Brady are not confined to this section
alone, but are perpetrated along the en
tire Mexican border. An effort is now be
ing made to get the Territorial officials to
!ake cognizance of tliem and ask for the
intervention of the General Government.

Arous*s the Ireof Ttco Squaxts by Killing
a HaHlennake.
FHCENIX, Ariz., May s.â EJitor Anson
H. fcmith of the Mojave Miner, was the
hero of a remarkable incident that oc
curred on the table lands near Needles.
came upon two Mojave squaws hold
ing an excited powwow over a big rattle
snake that lay coiled in the middle of the
road. With true tjajlantry he dismounted
and struck the reptile a dextrous blow on
tiie head.
Then the excitement becan. Instead of
thanking their deliverer the squaws began
to disrobe, and with many incantations
t row their garments as offerings to his
snakeship. The editor began to get
scared. He tried to mount his horse, but
the squaws insisted on his presence until
the charm was broken, and it was not
broken until they had discarded all their
clothing and had gone through a weird
dance over the remains of the rattle
snake. This was done in order to pro
pitiate the gods and break the spell that
portends the death of a big chief upon the
wanton slaughter of a venomous reptile.
Editor Smith left the scene *is soon as he
dared.

CAMP TALK AT
VENTURA TOWN
The Woman's Congress
Discusses Life Out
of Doors.
nArt, Flowers, Shells and Ter-
perance Are the Other
Subjects.
Parllament Adjourns to Next Octo
ber With Thanks to Ven
tura Ladles.
VENTURA, Cal., May s.â The second
day's session of the Woman's Parliament
opened at 10 o'clock this morning with a
very large number of ladies in attendance.
The opening pappr, "Latest Thoughts on
the Temperance Question," read by Miss
Jane Stewart of Riverside, was well writ
ten ami took advanced ground on the
question of the banisnment of the liquor
traffic. In the discussion tnat followed
the ladies showed by the earnestness of
their remarks the deep interest they taKe
in this subject.
"Art in the Home" was the title of a
most interesting paper read by Mary
Weaver of Santa Monica. This subject
was one that caused a great amount of dis
cussion, and showed the wide ranga in the
taste of the delegates in matters of the
adornment of the home.
At the afternoon session the general
subject for discussion was "Out-of-door
Life for Women." Mrs. Mary Sheriff
Fowler of San Jacinto was on the pro
gramme for tbe first paper. The subject
was "Camping." Mrs. Fowler wasnnable
to be present, therefore the time for this
paper was given over to hearing accounts
of camp ng trips taken by tne various
women of the parliament.
Mrs. O. V. Sessions of Hueneme gave
an interesting account of a six months'
trip she had taken through Southern Cali
fornia. Her description of the "house on
wheels," which was built for the occasion,
proved that with a little thought and
careful planning in this direction much
pleasure and comfort may be added to a
camping trip.
Dr. Rachel Reid of Pasadena very de
lightfuily described a trip she had taken
up Wilsons PeaK, in Los Angeles County.
Otheri followed, proving to all that
camp life was a benefit as well as a great
pleasure to the women of Southern Cali
fornia.
Alice J. Merritt of the State Normal
School, Los Angeles, was introduced, ana
gave an interesting talk on the subject of
"California Wildfiowers." She had
brought with her several varieties of wiid
tlowers, which were distributed among
those present, and she confined her re
marks mostly to the growth and customs
of theÂ«e canicular flowers. Alter a gen
eral discussion of this subject, Mrs. M.
Burton Williamson of Los Angeles read
an excellent paper, the subject of which
was "Shells."
Mrs. Williamson handled her subject
well and brought out points in shell study
that are often overlooked, but are most
interesting and instructive. This closed
the programme and a most interesting
and instructive meeting.
The president, Mrs. Galpin, In a few
well-chosen remarks thanked the ladies
of Ventura for the entertainment pro
vided and the many courtesies shown
them. The next meeting of the parlia
ment is the regular annual session, which
will be held in Los AngeJes next October.
MR. BhUSH OF SANTA ROSA
Says the Trouble With Mr. Fish Springs
From the Construction of a WnU
ten Contract
SANTA ROSA, Cal., May s.â The start
ling story that a charge of perjury had
been preferred against j. H. Brush, presi
dent of tiie First National Bank of this
city, was read in to-day's Call with great
astonishment by the people of this vi
cinity. It seems, however, that the arti
cle in question was wrong in saying that
the controversy between B. L. Pish and
Mr. Brush arose out of any transaction
connected with the water works of this
city. Mr. Brush bad nothing to do with
purchasing of machinery for the water
works here, and the amount sued for by
Mr. Fish was for a balance claimed as due
for machinery furnished to the water
works at Utiah, in which Mr. Brush is
largely interested. When interviewed by
a Call representative to-night Mr. Brush
said:
"it is not customary for me to try any
cases in which I am interested in the
newspapers, but since Mr. Fish seems to
want to air the matter it would perhaps
be well for me to say a few words. The
article in 'Ihe Call of to-day seems to be
mure the inferences of Mr. Fish than any
thing of a definite nature. It does not
seem possible that the Judge of a court
would publicly state His opinion on the
; veracity of a witness in an acticÂ» su!l
j pending. The differences bstween Mr.
: Fish and myself all arose out of the con-
I struction of a written contract. He claims
l there is $13? due for extras based on verbal
j agreements outside of the written con-
I tract, and I think the contract covered
everything. The transaction occurred
some rive years ago and had almost
escaped my n.emory when the action was
j commenced. Mr. Fish has done what he
' thought would hurt me the most and has
I in a measure succeeded in his desire, con
l aitlering the delicate position of trust I
j occ;ipy. Our differences will be decided
! by the Superior Court of San Francisco in
j due time, and neither the Grand Jury nor
: the newspapers can affect that decision."
BIG FIRE AT MAY BIRD.
A Portion of the Plant of the Famous
Yuba Mine Destroyed by a Con-
flag ration.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., May 5â News
reached here to-day of the destruction by
fire last Monday afternoon of a portion of
the famous Yuba mine at Maybird, in the
Washington Mining District. Maybird is
about twenty-live miles from hare and the
news traveled slowly.
The Yuba, which at one time was a
spiendid paying property, has not been
operated for several months, and the
works were in charge of H. R. Ayers,
a watchman. On the afternoon men
tioned he discover flames issuing from the
superintendent's dwelling, which he oc
cupied, and attempted to subdue them
unaided, but they soon got beyonrt his
control and he was compelled to call for
assistance from the inhabitants of May
bird.
They responded to a man and battled
with the tire for several hours. The con
flagration spread irom the superintend
ent's house to a boa'dlng-house patron
ized by the miners when the mine is in
operatioo, and tbence to the bunkhouse
all three structures being reduced to'
smoldering ruins.
The strenuous efforts of the fire- fighters
saved the works themselves, including the
hoisting apparatus and compressors, from
burning, though it was some time before
they were out of danger.
The cause of the fire, which caused a
loss of from $2500 to $3000, was a defective
flue. There was no insurance on the
property. It belongs to the Yuba Gold
Mining Company, of which George A.
Hare of ban Francisco is superintendent.
The fire came at a particularly inoppor
tune time, as the owners were negotiating
with prominent Ban Francisco capitalists
to invest a large amount of money to the
property and develop it to a larger ex
tent than was ever done before. The
deal is still progressing, however, and the
mine may be opened at an early dale.
PORTLAND ARSON CASE.
Self-Confessed Incendiary Alleges That He
Was Employed to Start a
Blaze.
PORTLAND, Or., May s.â Marcus Wolf
of San Francisco, a member of Wolf Bros,
here, whose wholesale clothing-house was
set on fire last July, went to trial on a
charge of arson to-day. Henry Jacobs
was the star witness for the prosecution.
He confessed to being a professional incen
diary, and the one having done Ihe ''job"
for the Wolfs. He declared that the
Wolfs promised to protect him, and
finally went back on him, whereupon be
changed his mind and turned State's evi
dence. Marcus Wolf, the witness averred,
planned the tire in the clothing-house Jast
July.
When the witness made his accusations
it was all the defendant could do to re
strain himself, and at times he indig
nantly called his attorney's attention to
the remarkable statements which were
being made.
Jacobs' story commenced at a time not
lon a before the tire on July '20, 1896. He
told of conversations with ths partners in
the firm. He went down to the Wolf
store and Marcus began to mention some
of their business troubles.
"He said 'I wish you'd burn this place,
it would bÂ« the making of me,' or words
to this effect," said Jacobs. "He said
business was not any too good of late, and
he was tired of seeing tho.-e old brand* in
the house."
Jacobs unhesitatingly admitt-d carry
ing out the instructions of the accused,
but says the latter failed to execute his
part of the agreement. The trial will
consume several days.
BELIEVES THE SAMARIA FLOATS.
British Shipmaster Henderson Confident
That the fifssmg Vessel
Will Return.
PORTLAND, Or., May s.â Captain W.
S. Henderson, a British master just in
port, does not believe the Samaria lost.
To the Telegram he said this evening:
"It is my belisf that the Samaria was
thrown on her beam ends and the cargo
shifted. Captain McÃae tindins it impos
sible to light his ship with the weight of
spars dragging to leeward, ordered the
masts and standing rigging cut away.
With the clearing of t.'ie wreckage from
the ship she was righted and walloweii
along in the trough of the seas until the
gale broke. Then an effort was made by
McÃae to rig the jury- masts.
"The Samaria is "in the coasting trade,
and, as is well known to mariners, coast
ers carry but lew spare spars. In all
probability tbere were not more than two
topsail yards and possibly a topgallant
mast left lashed in the scuppers of the
Samaria after the gale subsided. With all
these stepped and sail made upon them
McÃae would have hardly enough canvas
spread to keep steerage way on his ship,
laden as she is, in a favoring wind.
"For him to lose the Samaria the ship
must have foundered, and with the sight
ing of these spars I don't believe she has.
She has been blown far to the northward
out of the track of vessels, and it would
not surprise me to hear any day of some
roving halibut schooner coming into port
with the tidings of the mi-^iiig ship."
WARRING SAN JOSE HEIRS.
Sons of the Late Elezer Frost File Charges
Against Exr-cuir ces of His
Estate.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May s.â Erwin and
Minor Frost, sods of Elezer Frost, de
ceased, to-day filed a petition in the Su
perior Court asking that the powers of
Mrs. Dora Frost Vinter and Mr 3. Sarah
Wissxnan, executrices of the Elezer Frost
estate, be suspended ; that their letters of
administration be revoked and that a spe
cial administrator of the estate be ap
pointed.
In the petition it is alleged that Mrs.
Frost Vinter. the late widow of Elezer
Frost, atid her husband, William Vinter,
contemplate an extende I visit to Europe
for the purpose of delaying administra
tion of the estate. The executrices are
charged generally with neglecting the in
terests of the estate, allowing it to be
come non-productive and less in value,
while the petitioners confidently believe
the estate could long ago have been dis
tributed. They are also accused of appro
priating funds of the estate to their own
use. i
Judge Hyland ordered Mrs. Frost Vinter
and Mrs. Wissman to appear in court on
May 14, with all the necessary papers,
vouchers, etc., in their possession and
show cause why they should not be re
moved. The Frost estate is valued at
$125,000.
A similar petition was filed a few days
days ago by Mrs. Mary Laedericn and
Mrs. Mary Taylor, daughters of the late
Elezer Frost.

Simultaneously will occur the exchange
of the Sonora road for the Mohave divi
sion of the Southern Pacific, tha latter
line being already operated by the Atlantic

Mr. Walker stated, would in no wise be
nffected by the changes, but would con
tinue to be operated as an independent
line. He said it had not been decided
whether or not to retain the name of the
Atlantic and Pacific. Ample lundg are
available, and the road will be placed in
tha finest condition.

NEATLY BUNKOED
A Clever Ruse Worked
on the Prominent
Merchants.
Sharper Collects Prizes for an
Imaginary Picnic at
Linden.
Made H!s Escppe With Everything:,
From Kees of Beer to the
Latest Neckwear.
STOCKTON, Cal., May s.â Last week a
nura ber of the merchants of this city were
victimized by a clever sharper.
The picnic season has commenced, and
it has been the habit of a number of the
leading storekeepers and merchants to
donate merchandise prizes for advertising
purposes. Tnis has been the custom for a
number of years past, as the donors win
i lie good will of the picnickers and have
their generosity advertised on the pro
grammes.
The enterprising sharper took advan
tage cf this and last week made a tour
of the principal stores. He said that he
represented the citizens of Linden, wtio
were to hold a picnic there last Saturday,
and that any gifts for the occasion would
be acceptable. He would not take orders
for goods, saying he wanted to Bave the
merchants all the trouble possible, and
wou.d take the goods themselves along
with him.
The merchants knew that the Catholic
ladies of Linden were to give a picnic on
the 12th inst, and confounded the dates,
so when the enterprising stranger left he
had kegs of beer, wine, clothing, groceries,
hats, shoes, neckties and dozens of other
articles of value. And now the merchants
who were bunkoed are trying to keep the
matter quiet.

STOCKTON, Cal., May s.â Early m the
forepart of last February a nice-appearing
and rather pleasant-faced woman of mid

called at Mrs. Abbott's lodging-house in
the second story of the flat on the north
side of Main street, midway between
Stanislaus and Grant streets, No. 721, and
asked whether she conld get a room there.
In her arms she carried a little baby.
Rooms were shown her, and then she said
that she was acquainted with certain
people here, and that if she could ascer
tain their whereabouts she would prefer
to live with them, but that if they could
not be found she would return and take a
room there.
"It is so tiresome," she added, "carrying
my baby on the street. Would you mind
if 1 left it here while I am hunting for
my friends?"
"Certainly not," said the lady ad
dressed, and with that the little fellow
was taken in. The woman has not since

lies his looks 36 years. Certainly this was no ordinary
man who could run through his life so rapidly as to lose 36
" years of looks in 24 years. Yet this is an actual fact. A
man applied for the HUDYAN treatment not long ago. Ho

seven years, came to the city twice a year and dissipated.
His cheeks were hollow, his eyes were like burnt sockets,
his lips were bloodless, fearful gaunt emaciation had set in.
His legs were like spindles, his hands trembled, his knees
knocked; he looked at you, but he really was looking into
space. He could not remember the name of his town. He
slept on the doctor's chair for twenty minutes. When he
awoke he told a tale of woe. He said he could not sleep in
bed. Horrible nights and fearful days he spent. He had
lost thirty pounds in weight. He was constantly losing.
He seemed to think he was draining away. He attributed
his troubles to his early life of dissipation. And this man

CAHTO, Cal., May s.â The body of
Father Jeram, who was drowned in the
North Eel River yesterday, has not been
recovered. A most vigorous search has
been in progress all night and day. The
river banks are being patroled to-night
and friends are casting all manner of hur
riedly improvised grappling tackle in
their anxiety to recover the body. lHuqe
bonfires at night i.luminate the* river
bants at intervals of a mile apart while
the faithful colonists are industriously
pursuing tneir grewsome labor.
The Eel River at this point and period
is at its highest, owing to the heavy snow
still in the mountains, and which is melt
ing rapidly. Tiie north fork of the river
takes ils head in the Yollo Bolle Moun

and the current switt. Grave fears are
now entertained that the body will be
washed into the sea.
The commiseration depicted upon the
faces of the colonists at the 1033 of their
leader bespeaks with pathetic emphasis
their love for Father Jeram. All hope
seemed centered upon him to further their
colonial enterprise.

UKIAH' S SOCIAL SENSATION.
Merchant Abraham Charges His Domestic
Woes to His Wife's Ungcvern-
able Temper.
UKIAH, CÂ£l., May s.â The account in
to-day's Call of the altercation in Hop
land on Saturday between Mrs. Louis
Abraham of this place and Miss Varner of
Hopland has created considerable stir in
social circles here and in Hopland, where
all the persons concerned are well and
favorably known.
Mr. Abraham claims that Miss Varner
came to Hopland to visit her brother and
his wife two months after Varner com
menced clerking in Abraham's store, and
that she did not come, as claimed, when
her brother was first employed. He
further says that she has never called at
his store since she came to Hopland. and
has always, as far as hid knowledge is
concerned, acted in a perfectly ladylike
manner.
He declares that the young lady has
never followed him, but that the sus
picious harbored by Mrs. Abraham were
aroused solely b> r his wife's insanely jeal
ous disposition and ungovernable temper.
Abraham says that legal papers for a
separation were drawn between himself
and wife some two montns ago. and their
property rights and other matters ar
ranged to the satisfaction of both at that
time. He has no words of censure for hia
wife and says she has always been a good,
true woman and a good mother, but her
temper is the cause oi their troubles. He
feels keenly the notoriety which attaches
to his family and himself by reason of bit
wife's recent escapade.
ESCAPE FROM WHITTIER.
J Seven Male Inmates of the Reform School
Make a Successful Dath for
Liberty.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. May s.â Seven
male inmates of the Whittier State School
escaped from tbe institution last night.
They had been working in the electrical
and power department under the direc
tion of John Taylor. The boys are sup
posed to have taken their departure about
8 o'clock, but it was not until some time
after this that their absence was dis
covered.
Superintendent Van Alstyne ordered all
of his available force out in pursuit, and
they spent most of the night in searchins,
Din their efforts were without reward.
Early this morning a part of the posse,
headed by Fire Chief Daniel Monarity,

of the seven escapes to the police ana
Sheriff Burr. The name-* of the boys are
Lawrence J. Keogau, John Foley, Ed
Wilson, George Wilson, Harry Monomy,
John Kice and Pedro Garcia.
It was predicted that the change in the
administration at the school would result
in many inmates making breaks for
liberty, the boys attempting to take ad
vantage ol their new guards. As the
standing reward for the capture of tho
runaways is $10 a head, the escaped boyÂ»
are beine diligently sought for.

PULLS UP STAKES
The Angels Tell Him to
Change His Place
of Abode.
"Jerry" Leaves Reed-Lyford
Canyon for Regions
Unknown.
Goes Forth Into the Wilderness to
Indulge His Strange Religious
Vagaries.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May s.â The
hermit of the Mann hills has deserted
bis abode in the Reed-Lyford Canyon near
the picnic grounds of El Campo and left
for regions unknown. Last evening he
was seen by Constable John Mahar on
the county road near Tamalpais station.
He was trudging along with nis coat over
nis arm and his long, reddish hair flying
with the wind.
The Constable, who was one of the party
that discovered the hermit's retreat some
time pgo, called him familarly by the
name of Jerry. The hermit stopped and
shookbands and when questioned as to
where he was going said ti.at he didn't
snow. He intended to reach San Rafael
that evenine and from there he would
seek some wilderness where he could live
In peace and continue his religious
studies.
When questioned as to his ear'y life he
Baid that lie h d worked as a policeman
in the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, and
that be had a brother in the City. He
could not Â»tate how long he had lived
the life of a hermit; he had kept no track
of the flight of time. Here he branched
off into liis relieious talk and told of how
the angpls watched over him and taught
him great truths.
At his strange habitation in the Reed-
Lyford Cannon which he has just deserted
he had a pate erected ;n from of his hut.
Tnis pate was supported by posts, but no
fence was on either He said last
nipht that the angels had sent this to him
and told him to place it where he had it.
He would open this gate and carefully
close it after him, when he approached
hi? hut.
The hermit is intelligent and talks well
â¢on eveiy i-utject. Hi- reiieiom views are
strange and upon this topic alone does be
exhibit signs of insanity. When he was
discoverer some time a<;o in his secluded
retreat away from civilization he was
dressed in buckskin clothes, and was read
ing aloud from a bible. In his hut were
pictures of Catholic prients and volumes
of books such as "The Lives of the
Martyrs." For days at a time, he said, he
wi'Uiu fast in order to do penance.
Thus the life of the hermit became a
mystery to the people living in the
vicinity of Tiburon. They knew be lived
.somewhere about, but never could get a
glimpse of bim or his habitation. Now
he is gone and when he will return to his
old quarters is a matter of speculation.
A NEW HUMANE SOCIETY.
Friends of Dumb Animals Will Educate
the Rising Generation.
An organization to be known as the
Humane Educational Society of Calilornia
will be formed to-morrow afternoon in
t.'>Â« Young Mpd's Christian Association
building. The purpose of the society is
to protect the dumb animals of the State.
The means by which this is to be ac
complished are very different from those
of other bodies, with which whenever
possible ;he new society will co-operate.
In the fir- 1 place the society will establish
county branches or societies wherever the

The next movement will be to educate
the prople to treat their dumb animals
with more kindness and this will be be
gun in the public schools, Sabbath-scliools
and churches. The plan proved success
ful in England arid France. In Massa
chusetts, Washincton and a lew other
States humane education is required by
law. In this State the work ot humane
education hag been commenced by the
California State committee, which is com

last September and it has created several
county societies.
Among the members of the committee
are Rev. Dr. Gardner, Chnries H. Hol

Miss Emma M. Gay. The latter in dis
cussing the proposed organization stated
that but few people realize the cruelties
practiced upon dumb animals in th<?
mountain and farminz districts of the
The horse is the principal sufferer.
Those familiar with inese cruelties do uot
appreciate the inhumanity of the careless
and brutal owners. Punishment ior
cruelty will do much, but the greatest
good, she says, will be accomplished by
educating the growing generation.
HYSTERIA IN COURT.
Mrs. G. W. Gagan Overcome by Her
Fee ling* in the McLeod Trial.
Mrs. G. W. Gagan became very much
excited in Judge Carroll Cook's court yes
terday, and went into a fit of hysteria
while on the witness-stand. She was con
veyed from the room, but finally returned
and concluded her testimony in the case
of William McLeod, on trial for man
slaughter, the accusation being that he
caused his wife's death without malice on
the 17th of last March.
Mrs. Gagan testified Mrs. McLeod ran
into her house and cried out tnat she was
gaing to die. The woman was suffering
from nausea and soon afterward died.
The horror of the circumstances appeared
to overcome Mrs. Ga>;an while making her
second attempt to give her testimony, but
sbe finally managed to tell her story.
Mrs. Ella Bates testified that ehe saw
' McLeod put his hand on his wtfÂ»'s t.<roat,
but there was no signs of choking.
Officer Redmond, who arrested the de
fendant, Bwore that McLeod told him that
her depth had been caused by her own
tierce temper. He also told the captain of
pdf ice that he did not intend to choke his
wife, but was only loving her.
There was some testimony to show that
Mrs. McLeod died of iieart disease.
In his own behalf McLeod testified that
the trouble was made by Mrs. Bates, who
had thrust herself into their home, and
that he was trying to eject Mrs. Bates
when his wife had an attack of heart dis
ease which resulted in her death. He said
he did not know that his wife had heart
disease.
In reply to a question by Attorney Ar
thur Mack the defendant swore that he
had always supported his wife to the oesi
of his ability, and had never struck her in
his lite. It WBB shown that they were in
comfortable circumstances.
Daputy District Attorney Ho=mer ar
gued that McLeod was responsible for his
wife's death, whether he choked her or
â not, since, if she died from heart disease
on account of his acts, he must be pun
ished.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 6, 1897.
DR. HOBBS HERE
TO FORWARD CORN
He Will Load the City of
Everett With Prairie-
Grown Cereals.
Five Cargoes Are Now Ready
for the starving People
oi India.
California to Be Asked to Contribute
500 Tonsâ Story of a Great Pub
lic Cbarity.
Dr. Richard Gear Hobbs of Jackson
ville, 111., secretary of the Illinois Con
ference of the M. E. Church and special
representative of Dr. Louis Klopsch of
the Christian Herald, has arrived here to
attend to the loading of the whaleback
City of Everett with corn for the starving
India. He reached here yesterday,
and is at the Occidental.
The corn which is needed to load the
ship, or at least 2500 tons of it, is coining
by rail from Nebraska, lowa, Kansas and
Illinois. About 500 tons 01" it is here
already, being stored in the warehouse of
G. W. McNear, at Port Costa. The rest
will come along as fast as possible, so Mr.
Hobbs says, and he hopes to get it all
loaded and ready to sail for Calcutta, the
port for which it is destined, in three
weeks. The City of Everett la expected
down from the Sound in a day or two.
Though Dr. Hobbs has done a great deal
to get contributions of corn for the suffer
ing people of India he says he has done
nothing compared to Dr. Klopsch, who is
the head and front of this great public
charity, and he desires to have him receive
the credit for it His paper, Christian
Herald, Mr. Hobbs says, has a circulation
of 200,000 weekly, and Dr. Klopsch has
used its influence in favor of the people
of India and has already got enormous
contributions for them.
"He has enough at this date," said Dr.
Hobbs, "to load five ships. One of these
cargoes will go on the City of Everett and
another will go from New York on an
other vessel furnished by the United
State? Government. This last cargo will
consist of aboat 4000 ton*. The other
three cargos will be taken from New York
in British ships, as England has offered
to join us and carry away this grain.
"The City of Everett, which will be
loaded here, will carry about 3000 tons of
corn. As 2500 tons are coming from the
prairie Siates, and as there is room for 500
tons more, we hope that California will
make up this amount.
"The 4000-ton ship will sail from New
York first. After that England will con
tribute as many ships as are needed. The
movement is just at its height. I think
Dr. Klopsch is sure to get two or three
sbiplonds besides those already obtained.
"The Mennonites in Kansas have con
tributed no less than ninety carloads of
corn. They raised mo^t of the corn they
contributed in theircolony. The rest of ft
they bonuht. The farmers turough Illi
nois, lowa, Kansas and Nebraska have
contributed liberally. The Rev. Dr. T.
DeWitt Talmage, Dr. KloDsch and Mis*
Leach, the latter a returned Indian mis
sionary, have just completed a tour of
these States. Ihe meetings were thronged
and were attended with a great deal of
enthusiasm, while the contributions were
very liberal. The concludin*.- meeting was
to be at the Auditorium in Chicago, where
it was proposed to aÂ«k for a shiDload of
corn. 1 haven't heard from the meeting,
but I think they got it.
"We are asking only for corn, first be
cause it is cheaper than wneat, and next
because the Indian people are accustomed
to it and want it in preference to anything
else. Dr. Kiopsch has been identified
with many great charities. He raised
and- forwarded $60,000 to the Armenians.
He sent $30,000 and thirty carloads of
supplies to Kansas and Nebraska at the
time'of the drouth. He also sent a cargo
of wheat to Russia during the famine."
Dr. Hobbs is accompanied by Mrs.
Hobbs, who will go with him to India.
FORGERY CHARGED.
Investigation Into Haln A N'orrrnn
Company Affairs by the District
Attorney.
Attorney Baggett and M. W. Fox have
Jodged information of a sensational char
acter with District Attorney Barnes, pre
liminary, It is said, to the arrest of those
accused, alleging that certain weil-known
mining men connected with the Hale <fe
Norcross Company are guilty of forging
the seal of that company. The persons
accused constitute the board of directors
of the company, elected, it is charged, by
Attorney J3aggeit in direct defiance of an
order of the court.
The men involved in the accusation are:
Thomas J. Cole, president ot the Potosi
mine; A. J. McDonnell, a broker; George
W. Grayson and R. R. Grayson. The case
of the rival boards of directors has been
in court from time to time.
It is alleged that the Grayson board,
after organizinc for business, sent the
necessary certiticate of election to Ne
vada to be filed, and, as it needed the
official seal of the company, which the
other board refused to give, did away with
the old seal and made a new one, with
which the documents were stamped.-
The prosecution, according to Attorney
Bazgett, w .]| be based on that provision
of section 470 of the Criminal Code which
declares that the making of a seal of an
incorporation by unauthorized persons
constitutes a forgery.
District Attorney Barnes admits that
he is considering the matter oi the allega
tions of forgery, but will not be prepared
to render an opinion in the matter either
way till Saturday.
When R. B. Grayson, son of George W.
Grayson, and secretary of the Hale &
Norcross board of directors, accused ot
the alleged forgery, was seen last night
he made the following statement:
This matter is a surprise to me, but you may
put it down as another attempt of Fox and
Bagfrett to complicaee the litigation in which
the Hale & KorcroM Company is now involved.
We have done nothing illegal or criminal In
this mntier. The statement that we represent
the Hay ward interests is false. Hay ward has
no interest in the company at a.i. At tho
meeting where Fox served the injunction
upon us antl prevented our voting prnxie* nnd
regular certificates of stock we lia<J 86,000
shares, more than enough to carry the elec
tion.
Subsequently we met again, according to
order of the court, and Fox refused to cog
nize our proxies. We tuen held a separate
meeting and demanded, as a matter of form,
the books and seal of the company of Secre
tary R. U. Collins. He declined to turn the
property over to us. whereupon the directors
met a^ain and after rescinding the old seal of
the company adopierl a new. one. This we
wern privileged to do by law, aud if that is a
forgery, the law must be very defective.
We have inHtilut-.-d proceedings to recover
possession of the company's books and they
are now pending. Fox and his people are
getting impntient and all they desire is to
clog the record. They will find us ready to
answer the charge ii they bring It In court.
It has no weight whatever.
Attorney Bageett states that Alvinza
Hayward is believed to be behind the men
aimed at and that warrants charging them
with i'orjtery will in all probability be
secured even if the District Attorney ren
ders an adverse opinion.

Tne charity bazaar is as dangerous as

What we have done for Balboa avenue
will be largely labor in vain unless we do

Paris has learned by a fearful lesson
that accidents will happen in even the best

Mr. Dingley may still recognize his

The arbitration treaty goes to the waste
la?ket. We can settle our difficulties
â with England one by one as they arise.
Bryan is expected to visit California

hand and we can take to the mountains.
The tariff bill as reported is a trne sur
prise party. It was not only made unex
pectedly, but came in an unexpected
shape.
It is said by the Philadelphia Inquirer
that we are to have an onion trust, and it
is scarcely necessary to add it will be in
bad odor.
It is time for us ail to be giving consid

They will be with us pretty soon in large

It is not surprising to learn that the
Greeks would rather deal with the Turks

San Diego may now be expected to join
the list of cities thatclaim to have doubled
in population since 1890. There is a con
siderable increase in the school census.
We may as well settle down for a long
siege on the tariff quenion, as it is now
evident that the bill in its present form
can never be carried through by a storm

The powers when encouraging the Sul

possibility that he might get so bold that
it would become necessary to whirl in and
â whip him.
As no explanation of ex- President Har

has been forthcoming we may as well set
tle down to the conclusion that the baby

The export of gold is not altogether a
bad thing at this time, as it will have the
effect of inducing the Senate to hurry up
the tariff and provide the Government
with a revenue.
It was a wise move to take the Hawaiian
treaty feature out of the tariff bill. A
measure of that importance ought to
stand on its own merits and not be mixed
up with other things.
It was only a little while ago that some

With faster fruit trains to Eastern cities
we will be able to get tetter profit in those

better fruit, Â«o in this instance we may
account the Southern Pacific officials as

The correspondents who so forcibly de

probably went along -with the stragglers
who led the backward movement, and did

The bonnet which Victoria wears on

black velvet, with huge white plumes,

One Now England paper declares that a

It is said that over 780 applications have
been made for the erection at the Paris

every sort of engineering feat imaginable,
from revolving towers to a glass tunnel

that some among them will make the

FRUIT TRANSPORTATION.
The announcement published yesterday
that the Southern Pacific Company has
made arrangements for establishing a fast
service for fruit trains from Sacramento
to Chicago, New York, Boston and all the
principal shipping centers of the East
will be in the highest rtegree gratifying
uot only to our fruit-shippers, but to the
people of California generally. The im
provement is likely to be of immense
benefit to the State in many ways, and it
is to be hoped the experiraant will prove
so successful as to lead to further improve
ments in the same direstion hereafter.
The object of the scheme as announced
is to snip fruit from Sacramento between
6a. m. and midnight and land it in Chi
cago wiihin about 125 hours, so that it
will arrive there at 3 a. m., or in New York
at the same hour a day later, thus enabling
the auctioneers to get it unloaded and
catalogued ready for sale on the day of
arrival. This will mean an immense gain
in the value of the fruit, and will result in
securing for our shippers much better
prices than they have obtained lately.
Reports from all parts of the State
show that there is now every pros
pect of a good fruit crop, and as
those in the East seem to have
been largely damaged by frost the chances
are that the demand in the Eastern mar
ket for our products of this kind will be
exceptionable good. The improved schel
ule of freight service is therefore a most
opportune one, both for the California
shipper and for the Eastern consumer. It
offers to us an opportunity to make a
larger figure than ever in the Eastern
fruit market and to obtain there advan
tages which it will be our own fault if we
do not make permanent.
The season for shipping green fruits to
the East will soon begin, and it will not
be long before we are realizing some of the
benefits which may be expected from tha
new service. Fresh California fruit will
be in the East in large quantities as soon
as the return of warmer weatner there in
clines the people to desire fruit and ren
ders it an object oi universal demand.
We have to congratulate ourselves upon
obtaining this improvement, which so
materially widens our markets, and we
owe thanus to the officials of the South
ern Pacific Company, who have arranged
for the service and are prepared to do
their utmost to make the experiment a
successful one in every respect and for all
concerned.
AN APPALLIM HOSROR.
The city which usually bears and merits
the title of the gayest capital in the world
is to-day the saddest. Throughout Paris
there is a feeling of horror and of
caused by one of the moat appalling ca
lamities that has happened i:i any Civil
ized country for many a year. The dig
nity, the eminence ar.d ;he wealth of those
wto have fallen victims w:ii add to the
sensation of horror, lor death never seems
more terrible than when it comes sud
denly and cruelly upon those who have
the best means of enjoying ail the hopes
and splendors of life.
The swift and terrible destruction of the
fire is the mure noteworthy becauso it oc
curred in Paris, where the peoDie of the
world have been taught to beiieve muni
cipal regulations guarding against the pos
sibility of such accidents are most com
prehensive in their nature and most rig
idly enforced. Here, however, it seems
that a building was prepared for the re
ception of large numbers of persons which
in its nature was but little better than a
barn, and was made and decorated with
the flimsiest and most inflammable ma
terial. It appears from all reports that
within a comparatively few minutes after
the fire broke out, the roof fell, burying
beneath its weight in the flaming furnace
the throngs of men and women who,
packei at the doors, were unable to escape.
The calamity, however, was not dv.
-wholly to a neglect of proper precautions
against the possibilities of fire. Flimsy as
was thft structure in which the bazaar
was held, it bad eight door;, and had
there been anything like reason and good
order among those within all could have
escaped in safety. The crowd, however,
became panic-stricken, and in their terror
crowded and crushed one another at the
doors of the main entrance, leaving the
others unnoticed.
Against accidents of that kind there
is no possibility of guarding. Rea
son is gone when panic begins,
and the world has had many a fearful evi
dence that terror-stricken men and women
will trample one another to death in the
fearful rush, no matter how wide open
may be the means of escape. In fact, it is
only a short time ago when in the broad
open plains on the suberbs of Moscow
thousands of peasants died in the same
sort of panic-stricken rusti at the feast
attending the coronation of the Czar.
Many instances are known where dan
gerous panics have been averted by the
presence of mind and coolness of a singie
dominating intellect, lla 1 such a man or
woman been present in the throng that
crowded the Parisian bazaar Paris might
to-day be celebrating a hero instead of
mourning a direful calamity. Possibly,
however, not even the coolest head could
have withstood that, fearful wreck, and
there is no knowing but what some among
those who perished made every effort to
do so. In the presence of such a horror
as this humanity will not undertake to
criticize, and all the voices that are heard
will be those of sympathy and sorrow.
IT EISES IN CALIFORNIA-
California, with its new factories, its
new industries, its new public enterprises,
furnishes a solution to a problem over
which Now England is gloomily lengthen
ing its face. It bus for several days been
a matter for solemn foreboding on New
England's part that no wave of prosperity
has hove in sight thereabouts according
to appointment. By day and by night the
waiting community has mounted a hill
top with a telescope and searched the
horizon without discerning to much as a
prosperous bee in the daytime or an opu
lent firefly at night. Never pausing to
reason the thing out according to the laws
of cause ana effect, New England has laid
the blame for this upon the new adminis
tration, which has:i' t been in power long
enough to catch its breath and light a
cigarette after the magnificent race to get
there.
But tne correction of our misguided
brethren of the far East ia plain before us,
and we lay hold of the duty gladly. The
reasou why Now England cannot yet dis
cern the promised wave ol affluence which
is really to overlay ihe country according
to the best calculating within a few
months is because it is too far away. The
wave has chosen to do its rising in Cali
fornia, and as yet it has not proceeded
very far easiward. If a few Chicagoans
will take the Yerkes telescope up in a bal
loon and get a focus down this side of the
Sierras they will behold a wave of pros
perity that is setting ready to travel over
the continent, with factories, railroads,
beet ranches and everything else that is
profitable in the waks of it.
Just keep California in view, ye gloomy
â ons of eiprctancy. We Are acquiring
new industries of all kinds. Tobacco
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 6, 1897.
raising, canaigre cultivating, beet-sugar
refiningâ these are examples of the more
recent developments from our soil;
while the building of new factories all
over the State for the accommodation of
the more familiar and older industries,
such as blanket-making, shoemaking, etc.,
etc., is additional evidence of an awakened
spirit of confidence and enterprise in the
people of this vigorous State.
Here the wave of prosperity will have
its source. To westward let New England
and the middle country peer for the first
glimpse of the approaching flood.
TRAFFIC AGREEMENTS.
The decision of the Railroad Commis
sioners on the complaint of the Union
Transportation Company against the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road, which was published in The Call
yesterday, is in thorough accord with
public interests, and it can hardly bo
doubted that it will be sustained by the
courts should an appeal be taken by the
complainants.
In its essential elements, the decision
declares traffic agreements between con
necting common carriers are valid and
are matters only of private concern to the
parties directly interested. In the par
ticular case under review.Chairman La Rue
said that the contract was ciearJy made in
the interest of the public, in so far as it
made it possible to establish lower rates
to shippers than would otherwise be the
case. It might be inferred from thii that
an arrangement which Is not for the
public benefit would be overruled, but
i hat inference is one which cannot be re
garded as settled until a case involving
the exact point arises for determination.
It will be remembered that the Union
Transportation Company, running a lino
of steamboats, alleged lbat a contract
exists between the Valley road and the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, which controls a competing line
of steamers, and it was further alleged
that this contract was illegal because tt
excluded the complainants from partici
pating in the business of the road between
San Francisco and points south of Stock
ton.
The defense made was based on the
ground that the contract caused no dis
crimination to any shipper and therefore
was not in any sense a matter whicli
could be reviewed by the Railroad Com
mission, or was in any way a violation of
the law. It was further alleged by tlia de
fendant that the â¢contract resulted in a
material reduction of through rates to all
shippers over ti.e lines and was therefore
in the nature of a public benefit.
As evidence for the defense the contract
was submitted to the Commissioners for
private examination, and it was after an
investigation of it* terms and their opera
tion that the decision was made. The
complainant has asked leave to amend
the complaint, and it is understood
that the object is to lay the basis for
taking an appeal to the courts. The con
clusion of the matter will be awaited with
no little interest. The issue is one of con
siderable importance, not only to com
mon carriers, out to the public generally,
and a final decision of the points involved
is a matter of no little concern.
As we have stated, the decision of the
Commissioners is well founded from the
point of view ot public interest, as well as
for tne transaction of the business of com
mon carriers, and there is every reason to
believe that it will be sustained by the
Judges should it come before them.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
It is expected that there will be sucti a
gathering of the clans of music-teachers as
never before at the Music- Teachers' National
Convention noxt month in New York. The
affair will take place from June 24 to 28,
at the Grand Central Palace, ond the man
agers are already a-sured of an attendance of
over 14,000 teachers from all parts of the
country. The Metropolitan Permanent Or
chestra will be present at the orening meet
ing, at which proceedings will be inaugurated
by speakers representing the Slate ani city
governments and the association. The musi
cal features of tne opening meeting will be
under the direction of Arthur Claassen, who
will also conduct on another evening the
singing of part songs by tie Ariou Society of
Brooklyn, the society which won the highest
prizes at a recent meeting of theSaengerbund.
"The Messiah" will be given by a chorus of
nearly 1500 voices, the nucleus of which will
be the People's Singing Societies, organized
by Frank Damrosch, who will conduct.
The department of women's work in music
promises startling and interesting revelations,
Mrs. Theodore Sutro, who is at the head of
work of this sort, being well known for her
MRS. THEODORE SUTRO, a Musician of Many Gifts,
enthusiasm in the exploiting of women's
work, especially ia music. Mrs. Sutro is a
wonderful woman. She can paint in a way to
make artists admiro her gift; she is a musi
cian of a broad type, who has made more than
one poor struggling man or womau recog
nized and successful ; she has studied law, and
actually graduated at the top ot a law class,
and she can address cr lead a meeting as few
men can.
Thegrep.t idea of the MuÃic-teachers' Con
vention is to give the musicians of the coun
try an idea of the progress that has been made
during the last few years. Prizes Â«re offered
by the- association for American compositions,
full particulars of which can be obtained by
addressing K. 11. Woodman, chairman of the
executive committee, 10 West Fourteenth
street. New York. Professor (low's special
committee on music in the college and uni
versity will give a detailed report, und the
committee on public-school training and
slgnt-reading, of which Frank Damrosca is
chairman, will consider the subject in three
sessions. The American Guild of Organists
will co-operate in the convention.
The music critics of Berlin are very much
wrought up over an article by Dr. Kurr which
appeared in tin; Frankfort Zeitung. The doc
tor plainly staled thnt the honesty of some of
the Berlin critics was doubtful; in fact, that
very few of them were not open 10 bribes, and
that among artists their veniality wa< a mat
ter of common comment- No sooner was their
attention called to this article than the indig
nant music critics called a meeting at their
verein, to which they invited those writers on
music who did not belong to their society. A
formal protest was drown up against Dr. Kerr,
and he was branded a liar ana a slanderer. All
ihe leading papers in Berlin printed the pro
test, which was signed by twenty-nine music
critics. A very few writers on music refrained
from signing the protest, chief among them
belnc Wilhelm Tappert of the Klelne Journal
and Wilhelm Lackowitz of the Lokalanzeiger.
Dr. Kerr now says that they are the two meu
whom ho meant to brand with dishonesty.
Their confreres are now trying to egg Tappert
and Lackowitz on to sue Dr. Kerr for libel, and
it Is believed that the lawsuit will have some
very interesting developments.
Max Hirschfeld, formerly musical director
of the Tivo'.i, has produced an opera, "Au
Clair de la Lune," at the Castle Square Thea
ter, Boston, with a very fair measure of suc
cess. Hirschfeld, who Is the musical director
of the theater, has written both book and
music, and the book is said to be much better
than the music. He has laid his scene in Mar
seilles, in 1812, and has imagined a plot that
admits of strong dramatic music. His fault
seems to be that he has tried to ba realistic,
out at the same time has not had courage
to follow In the footsteps of the radical young
Italians, who bow the knee to realism. Philip
Hale says "he fails to be dramatic when drama
cries to him." Into the score of his opera
Hirschfeld has woven tho old French Â»ong,
"Au Clair de la Lunc." Martin Pache played
the leading tenor role, and he does not seem
to have added to the success of the perform
ance. Hirschfeld has written two other
operas, a romnntlc comic opera, "The Star of
India," and "Dorcas," played here by Pauline
Hall on her last visit.
Lillian Nordica seems to dog the footsteps oi
the Grau Opera Company and continue to fan
the flame of her dispute with Grau and the
De ReÂ«zkeÂ«. The Convent Garden season in
London under Grau's management is just
about commencing: Nordica is there also and
the papers are pathetically, asking "Cannot
this dispute be patched up? Nordica is will
ing if Jean de Reszke ca:i be compelled to
make me amende honorab'.e for havin? induced
Melba to study the part of Brunhilde, bo cov
eted by Nordica." Poor Melba has come off
worst in the dispute, for she has withdrawn
entirely from the Grau fold. She is to make a
coucort tour through the British Isles in the
autumn and next winter will sing in New
York with Walter Damroseh's company.
A number of letters of the late Emperor Wil
liam 1 have just been published in Berlin.
One of them, dated February 2, IS6I, is con
sidered verr interesting by Wagnerians.
Translated, It runs: "My daughter, the Grand
Duchess of Baden, has asked me if it Is not
possible to produce at Benin one ot the last
works written by Wagner, which, I think,
form a cycle. All I know about his works is
that they were rehearsed at Weimar by Liszt,
but that the music was so crazy that the idea
of producing them was abindoned. I beg
you to give me some information on the sub
ject."
Wagner's more advanced works seem quite
unable to meet with populnr favor in Italy.
The people complain that they prefer the ad
ventures of human beings to the semi-mytho
logical-adventures o( de:ni-gods and people of
myth and fable. Nevertheless the impresarios
continue to produce the advanced Wagner
works, probably on the principle that if
Italy does not like them it mmt be made to
hear them until it does. "Tristan and
Isolde" has just been coldly received at Turin,
but nevertheless the work is to be given at
Rome, Milan, Florence and Naples.
In a book entitled "A Journey in China"
(just published by Dunckler & Co., Lelpsic)
the Russian traveler, Obrutscheff, speaks ad
miringly of the aerial concerts made by
pigeons in the Celestial Kingdom. It seems
that a sort of teollan harp is attached to each
pigeon, either to make music or to frighten
away birds of prey. "The sound produced
by these winged musicians," says the traveler,
"is sweet, soft and melancholy, and when a
band of them pass together it sounds like a
concert of seolian harps. The Chinese seem
very fond of these aerial concerts ; for at Peking
I saw on all sides bands of winged musicians,
each pigeon having its curious little instru
ment attached to it."
In ratifying the lease made with Maurice
Gran, the directors of the Metropolitan have
decided that there will be no grand opera in
Italian next season, which means that there
will be no grand opera of any sort under
Grau's direction. The artists, like tne De
Reszkes, will remain abroad next reason,
visiting New York the season after next. Grau
will act as manager of the Metropolitan, and
will book certain entertainments, and pos
sibly ii short season of German opera. It is
doubtful whether Mapleson will again try to
become an active factor in New York operatic
affairs. A great many people who profess to
be well informed believe that Grau will be
persuaded to give an opera season after ail.
Sonzogno, the great Italian impresario and
publisher, has taken the Fenlce Tneater in
Venice, where, among other novelties, he will
produce Leoncavallo's new work, "La Bolieme."
W:,en all the arnnigemants wore completed,
another impresario took the Rossini Theater
and announced his intention of giving Leon
cavallo's new opera, "La Boheme," which has
been running with such immense success at
La Scala. Experts say they see in this move
the fine Italian hand of Ricordi, a rival pub
lisher of Sonzogno's.

The Musical Courier speaks in the highest
terms of the California contralto, Mrs. Francis
Graham, who is studying in Paris. Her voice
has a clear range of three octaves, and she can
trill without effort on the high C in spite of
its pure contralto quality. She has been with
the Carl Rosa Company, and made a hit as
Hansel in "Hansel and Gretel."
The tenor, Van Dyck, has received from the
Emperor of Austria the cross of knight of the
Order of Francis Joseph, which Bhows that In
Austria a man of merit may aspire to high
distinctions, whatever may be the circle of his
activity. I n some countries it is a sort of un
written law that actors, singers and journalists
snail never receive any but small and trivial
decorations.
Mme. Adellna Patti has ended a successful
season of opera at Monte Carlo and has re

Wales. She is reported to be very much out

that ihe has canceled all her Immediate en
garments.
What Is known as the "normal pitch"
(diapason normal) la making such headway in
European countries that foreign musical Jour
nals express the hope that it will soon be
known as the 'â¢international pitch." Most
singers would be glad to see the normal pitch
accepted In America. The difficulty is that
many bauds would have to go to great expense
in buying a uumber of wind instruments.

MRS. McKINILY KISSED HIB?.
The Easter ho'.idnys brought many school
excursion parties to Washington, say* the cor
respondent o( t tie Sun. Hall a dozen gray
uniformed youngsters from a military institu
tion at Montclair. N. J . came in charge of a
teacher, ana were in the Whits House at an
early hour when Mrs. >UK.uiey was receiving
her friends. When the boys heard this they
asked and obtained permission to pay their
respects. They shook hands gravely and
proudly with the tweet-faced lady, all except
ing oneâ a handsome little fellow by the name
of McCutcheon, the smallest of the party,
whose natty gray clothes fitted him to perfec
tion. Mrs. McKinley drew him to her when
he held out his hand.
"I think I shall huve to kiss you," she said,
â 'you're such a nice-looking boy," and kiss
him ehe did.
While tne cadets were writing their uame3
in the register of visitors kept by Mr. Morgan,
the Treasurer of the United States, at his of
fice in the treasury building, the teacher told
the story about Mrs. McKinley and the lad,
and opposite the signature, "N. McCutcheon,
Greenwich. Conn.," the Treasurer has in
scribed, "Mrs. McKinley kissed this boy to
day."
FRATERNAL DEPARTMENT.
Sau Francisco I-odgre No. 3, B. P. O. X ,
Declared to Be the Only Lodge
in San Francisco.
Meade D. Detweiler, the grand exalted ruler
of the Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks, published a notice in the advertising
department of The Call yesterday to the ei
fect that under the laws of the order there
can be but one lodge thereof in a city, and
that the only legally existing and recognized
one In San Francisco is San Francisco Lodga
No. 3. which on last Friday dedicated its new
lodgeroom in Central block.
The reason for this publication Is the fact
that there is another body in this Cityâ Golden
Gate Lodge (Incorporated)â which has set up
the claim that it is a lodge of Elks. Prior to
last August there arose some trouble in the
then existing lodge of Elks in this Citr, and
the matter, coming before the Grand Lodge,
was referred to the grand exalted ruler, who
was empowered to investigate the causes of
complaint and act. As a result of his investi
gation, which Involved, among other things,
the elving of masquerade balls against the
wishes of a number of the members of the
lodge, he took away the lodge's charter, and
subsequently, upon petition he organized
and Instituted a new lodge, to be known as
San Francisco Lodge No. 3. It had at that
time twenty-six members, and the instltutiou
was on the 23d of last August. Â»â¢
At the time that the grand exalted ruler
took away the charter from the then existing
lodgÂ« there was on hand certain funds whlcn
the official named ordered turned over to the
GrÃt'd Lodge, which was done. To this those
of the former memDership, or, more properly,
a certain number of that membership, filed a
protest against the proceedings and laid claim
to the funds. With a view to have the matter
passed upon judicially they commenced an
action in the Superior Court to have the title
to the money denned. The case is still pend
ing. la the meantime these and other* who
sympathized with them organized what is
known as "Golden Gate Lodge, B. P. O. E. (In
corporated)."
Alter San Francisco Lodge was instituted a
number of San Francisco's prominent citizens
became members of that organization. In the
now body of the twenty-six who became mem
bers at the time ol institution bpt nine had
been members of the old organization. Since
then a hundred of the members of the old
lodge have been admitted to membership, and
new members were added until now the lodge
numbers 201 and the following: named are the
officers: Exalted ruier, J. R. Howell; es
teemed leading knight, Thomas A. McGowan
esteemed loyal knipht, J. H. Wood; esteemed
lecturing knight, W. W. Briggs; secretary.
Harrison Houseworth; treasurer, H. a. Hagan
tyler, L. G. Wcatherly; trustees*â D. McMillan,

officers were installed by J. O. Reis, acting as

TO SEND

HYPNOTIZED
Judge Campb3H's Advice
in the Kline
Case.
THE BOY'S MOTHER BEGS
IN VAIN.
How He Was Saved From a
Dose of Carbolic
Acid.
THE 'â¢DOCTOR" RECONSIDERS
THE MATTER.
Dees Nat Think Hj Should Influence
the Boy to Gj Home Against
His Will.
Judge Campbell yesterday disposed
temporarily of the peculiar case of Eddie
Kiine, hypnotic "subject," with one of
those Soiomone3que flashes of judicial
wisdom that have given him more or less
fainp.
E.ldie Kline ran away from a very good
home some days ago, and his mother on
the day of his disappearance received a
letter from him bidding her good-by, ana
saying that he had shipped as a cabin-boy
on an ocean-going vessel, was to receive
$35 a month, which he would send to her,
and charging her not to worry about him.
Ttie letter was dated on board the vessel.
This letter Mrs. Kline subsequently
found was misleading, and she traced her
boy to the Hypnotic Institute at 44 Sixth
strpet, only a stone's throw from her home
at 511 Minna streer. Mrs. Kline, after she
learned of the whereabouts of ncr boy,
was still unable to secure an interview
with him until an officer of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, H.
McMarray, wa3 called in. To him the
boy was delivered up. He refused to go
home, and was accordingly taken to the
lockup on a charge of vagrancy preferred
by the mother.
The hearing took place before Judge
Campbell yesterday morning. The
mother, a little German woman, with
flushed face, laboring under excitement
and wearing the siens of distress, told her
storyâ that her boy, formerly very duti
ful, was entirely changed, had deserted
his home, had iried to conceal Irom her a
knowledge of his whereabouts, and finally
refused to come home; that his appear
ance was as changed as his conduct, and
that she hardly Knew him when she t rst
saw him after his disappearance. She said
that sue had visited the instituts, and had
been toid by both Baker and Thornton
that the coy was not there, but that they
promised to send him home when he came
there. They did not do so. She learned,
she said, that he attempted to commit sui
cide. She was convinced that he was un
der evil influences, and that great harm
was being done to him.
Then l 'Dr." M. M. Thornton, business
manager and one of the operators of the
institute, was called, and in the course of
his testimony told some remarkable
things. He confessed that he assumed
the title of "doctor" being a doctor of
science. Thornton, by the way, is the in
dividual who has figured in the news
papers recently through his wife's sensa
tional attempt at suicide on the day of
her weduing, because of the report carried
to her that the groom was already mar
ried and the father of children; and hiu.
Thornton's, following the attempt of his
wife by being overtaken by fits, necessi
tating the removal of both to the Receiv
ing Hospital.
"1 left him in the office that evening,"
said Thornton, "while I went to attend a
patient. I cure the liquor, cocaine and
morphine habits through hypnotic aug
gestion and I work best, in such cases
when the patient is asleep. A leay want
pa rue to treat her husband and I received
word from her by telephone that he was
asleep.
"I "went, and returned to the office at
about miunieht. The boy was lying on a
lounge semi-conscious. 1 saw something
was wrong. He told me he had taken a
dose of carbolic acid. I examined his
mouth and found it burued. I immedi
ately placed him under hypnotic influ
ence, and by suggestion counteracted the
effects of the poison. He was all right
next morning, although I was careful
about what he ate, as his stomach was
sore."
"Do you mean to say that without ad
ministering antidotes and by mere sug
gestion you overcame the effects of car-
Dnlic acid," said the court.
"Yes, sir, and could do the same with
any poison. I would not fear the result
of "giving a dose of strychnine to a subject
and telling him it was water, allowing
him to drink it. On the other band, I
would not take the risk for thousands of
dollars of giving a suoject a drink of
water, sugjeiting it was strychnine."
Judge Campbell declared flatly, not
withstanding, that he believed the nerves
and the mind of the subject must neces
sarily be weakened until, if pursued, he
became a driveling idiot.
During all the testimony the boy in
question, a good-looking, neatly dressed
young man, stood by with downcast and
sullen expression. Questioned, he said
his parents had "treated him well enough
in a way," but he did not wish to return
home. Judge Campbell advised him that
that was the best place for him and that
his mother was his best adviser. Turning
to Thornton he said:
"When you wish you have this boy
under complete control, can make htm do
anything you wish?"
"Yes."
"Then cause him to go home to his
mother; cause him to want to remain."
The ''doctor" was taken by surprise and
did not reply.
"Will you do it?" said the court.
"Yes, I will."
"Then do so, and this case is continued
until Saturday to see if you keep your
word."
â¢â¢Very well, we will see now what thero
is to hypnotism," said Thornton, turning
away. " "Shall I take the uoy with me ?"
'Yes."
The scene in court quickly dissolved.
Seen at his office a little later Baser and
Thornton had been discussing the situa
tion. A*ked if they were going to send
the boy home Thornton said: "I will see
that he gets home by Saturdayâ the day
we are to report in court."
Baker, his partner, said : "The boy does
not want to go horns, and we have no
right to influence him to do what he does
not want todo."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MAY 6, 1897.
FATHER O'RYAN
ON SOCIALISM
Address by the Reverend
Gentleman in the
Temple.
Trades Guilds in the Middle
Ages Organized by the
Catholic Church.
Popes end Cardina s Raised Their
Voices on Behalf of Down
trodden Humanity
Roy. Father Philip O'Ryan, spiritual
adviser of the League of the Cross, deliv
ered a lecture last night before the Social
ist Labor party, at the Temple, 117 Turk
street. His subject was "The Catholic
Church and the Social Problem." The
hall was crowded, and the lecture gave
rise to much discussion.
The speaker began by saying that the
world had to confront and solve the great
social problem during the comine cen
tury. At the present time, he said, capi
tal had gathered to itself all the wealth
and all the productive machinery of the
world. Ali these things were in the hands
of the few, while the masses of the people
were poor and their faces were trodden
upon by the feet of the rich.
The Catholic church had been in exist
ence for nineteen centuries, daring the
whole of which time she had been the
church of the people, and such she would
and must continue to be. The seat of the
highest dignity of the church is called
"The Throne of the Fisherman."
The speaker areued that the labor prob
lem was solved in the Middle Ages, when
the church was supreme all over the civ
! iliztd world by tue workmen's guilds or-
I ganized under the auspices of the church,
j and every trade and profession throughout
Europe when Europe was Catholic had
its guild. These guilds bound all classes
together in the practice of religion and
morality, for that was possible when all
Europe was Catholic. They defended the
innocent and helped to punish the guilty.
They visited and comforted the sick and
â¢buried the dead. They covered the face
of Europe with a netword of sympathy,
benevolence and charity.
The speaker said that in 1885, where a
concerted invasion of Africa was made by
Europeans partly for the purpose of ac-
I quiring choice territory aud partly for the
j purpose of gathering slaves lor sale, Pope
j Leo sent one of his Cardinals through
j Europe demanding that they should put
i down tbe slave traffic. At the Congress
! of Nations soon after his voice was heard
and needed ana traffic in negroes aDol
ished. Pope Leo soon after that Â«Â»vent
issued his famous encyclical on the con
j dition of the working people. He was de
, nounced for that by the conservatives and
] he was called a socialist.
Pope Leo's solution of the labor qups
j tion was founded on the Gospel of Christ;
i justice and charity founded on religion,
j binding on every man, employer and em
j ploye. These are the great virtues -which
[ should rejuvenate the world; tbey are the
! great and the only virtues that can bring
] material prosperity to the world again.
'â  When the Pope said that In casp of ex
-1 trome destitution, when men were brought
! to the verge of starvation, property then
i became common, and there could be no
; robbery, be was denounced as being worse
' than a socialist, in fact an anarchist. The
' Pope held that the employer should prac
i tice justice, and that there should be a
; fair day's wages for a fair day's work â
' wages sufficient to support himself and
family in a decent and respectable man
| ner. He said :
"It is neither justice nor humanity to
I grind down men with excessive labor so
as to stupefy their minds and wear out
their bodies. Daily labor must be so reg
ulated that it may not be protracte 1 dur
ing longer hours than strength permits. "
Cardinal (iibbons' defense of the Knights
of Labor wa3 spoken of as bein : in line
with the sentiment 3 and policy of the
! church.
HARRY TERRILL. 808 TERRILL.
The announcement made in The Call yesterday that the Terrill brother, of the
Bay City Wheelmen, would leave this morning for Paris and try their speed there
against the foreign cracfcs created considerable discussion in cycling circles yester
day. Some time ago Harry Terrill stated that he thought of going, and he has
finally induced his brother, William, or "Bob," as he is more generally known, to
accompany him. V. Yenlhac of Paris, who raced at the recent indoor tournament,
will accompany them, and besides racing in Paris they expect to ride at every promi
nent meet on the Continent.
Harry Terrill stated to a Call representative yesterday that the prospect of this
trip is what prevented himself and his brother from entering the Velodrome races
last Sunday, as the foreign associations have not yet recognized the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clnbs, and he would be an outlaw, in a racing sense, there. Under
these conditions Otto Ziegler Jn cannot go to France next month, as he expected, un
less the foreign associations recognize the V. A. C. C. sanctions.
Nevertheless, Terrill predicts a big success for the new movement in this State,
and said if he and his brother had intended to stay here they would most certainly
have entered. He thinks the L. A. W. and C. A. C. C. will soon come to an agree
ment, and that Sunday racing will be sanctioned by the L. A. W. ; if not, that the
control of all racing will be taken from the L. A. W.
A large party of the Bay City Wheelmen will be down to the 7 o'clocK boat this
morning to bid the Terriil brothers bon voyage.
WRANGLING OVER
MISSION PARK
The Associated Clubs Dis
cuss the Question Pro
and Con.
A Much Smaller Tract of Land
Recommended by Various
Delegates.
The Zological Collection Finds N~
Favor From the Cub.' Rep
resentatives.
The question of a park for the Mission
district was the only theme under dis
cussion at the meeting of the Associated
Clubs last night.
The ball was set rolling by the motion
of W. L. Williamson for indorsement of
the club on the proposition of providing a
park for the Mission district as advocated
by the Mission Park Association.
Judge F. W. Van fteynegom took the
floor and spolci against the proposition on
the ground that such an undertaKiug
would not benefit the Mission residents.
He claimed tnat what the people there
needed was a smaller recreation ground
for the benefit ol the families of the Mis
sion. And besides he said, there is no
tract ot land sulliciently large to be had in
the Mission proper. He considered it was
a real-estate scheme to foist a tract of land
upon the taxpayers to benefit some at the
expense of all.
Dr. fealrield coincided with Judge Van
Reynegom and recommended the pur
chase of the cemeteries, where an excellent
botanical garden could bo maintained.
T. F. llapgerty offered a resolution that
the Supervisors be requested to purchase
thp cemetery grounds for a park.
Marcus Kosenthal amended Haggerty's
resolution by striking out the cemeteries
and leaving it optional with the Super
visors to i>urchase a site within the bound
ary of Fourteenth and Thirtieth streets.
This prevailed, and consequently gaye
the preater Mission Park a black eye.
The committee on public utility handed
in the following recommendation?, wnich
were deferred to a special meeting of the
club next Wednesday evening:
Resolved, That tne Board of Supervisors be
requested to appoint a corps of engineers to
examine into and report to the Board of Su
pervisors as to the cott, quantity and quality
of water and practicability of the various
propositions now pending before the Board ol
Supervisors for the municipal ownership of
water works by the City and County of San
Francisco.
Resolved, That if said corps of engineers re
ports favorably upon any of said propositions
that the Supervisors immediately proceed to
acquire such property and take such step? as
will lead to municipal ownership of water
works.
Reaolved, That the secretary of this associa
tion be instructed t> transmit a copy of these
resolutions to the Hoard ot Supervisors, and
also to nil civic organizations, requesting their
early consideration and joint co-operation;
and
Rtxolred, That we commend the efforts of
the Mayor and Board of Supervisors and the
public press of this City and County in elicit
ing the detailed information in reference to
the subject of water rates ana properties now
available for the promotion of public in
terests.
ResolroL, That the .Supervisors be requested
to discard tne Illumination of street cross
ings on prominent thoroughfares by gaslight
and to substitute electric lights on such
crossings.
The committee was instructed to urge
the Supervisor? not to throw the City into
a condition of darkness by extinguishing
the street lights, as proposed by that body,
for the purpose of making up the impend
ing financial deficit.

PECULIAR
RUSE OF
MR. GILLIS
Raised a Pretended Issue
Over a Traffic Con
tract.
HIS MOTIVE NOW MADE
CLEAR.
Has Entered Into a Similar Com
pact With the Southern
Pacific.
SOME NEW PASSENGER SATES
ANNOUNCED,
They Were Put la on the Very Day
the Railroad Commission Ren
dered Its Decision
Havine made a pretense of contesting
the validity of the contract between the
Valley roaa and the California Navigation
and Improvement Company, and having
secured the decision of the Railroad Com
mission ttiat such a traffic agreement is
legal, James Gillis of the Union Trans
portation Company has new entered into
a similar compact with the Southern
Pacific Company.
From developments which came to light
yesterday it would appear that scarcely
had Chairman La Rue on Tuesday con
cluded the announcement of the commis
sion's opinion relative to the contract
under fire when a similar agreement was
signed at the ottice of the Southern Pacific
Company between that company and the
Union Transportation Company, at least
so far as relates to passengers.
A3 a result agents ot the Southern Pa
cffic Company throughout the San Joa
quin Valley as far south as Fresno were
notified on the same day of the arrange
ment, and wera given a new schedule of
passenger rates to apply on the main line
between Ban Francisco and Fresno, and
on the Oakdale line between San Fran
cisco an d Merced.
These rates are for first-class fares, lim
ited to six months, via the Southern Pa
cific Company and the Union Transporta
tion Company. They went into effect on
Tuesday Jast. The new scnedule is as fol
lows, being from San Francisco to the
points named:
They are made to conform a* nearly^ as
possible to the rates charged over the Val
ley road to competitive points, and are a
considerable reduction from the former
first-class rates charged to the same points
by the Southern Pacific Company.
It is considered probable that the Rail
road Commission will hear nothing fur
ther on this subject from the original
complainant against the Valley road, al
though when the decision on the contract
was rendered the Union Transportation
Company made a pretense ot desiring to
carry the controversy into the courts.
ST. BRIGID'S FESTIVAL.
Three Nights of Miuic in the Basement
of the New Church.
At St. Brigid s Church on Van Ness
avenue and Broadway, this evenine, will
be given the May musical festival arranged
by the ladies of the parish for the purpose
of raising lands for finishing the interior
of the basement.
Tne festival will last to-morrow and
Saturday evenings, and will partake of '
the nature of a promenade concert. About
$2000 is required to decorate the interior,
and it is believed that the sum realized by
the concert will go a long way to meeting
ibis end. . ...
As soon aa the interior work is done
Father Cottle will hold services there.
Sunday, Jnne 6, is set as the date for the
first services.
Most of the instrumental nans ic will be
by a local parish orchestra. The church
choir is arraneing for the vocal pro
gramme, and the following â well-known
vocalists have been selected: Mme.

THE ECHOES
PROVE VERY
UNPLEASANT
Hebbard's Attorneys Are
Fighting to Shut Out
Evidence.
LIVERNASH'S STORY NOT
RELISHED.
Interesting Side Lights on the
Doings of Sheehan and
Watt.
MORE TALES OF FINANCIAL
HODGE - PODGE.
The Battle for Free Speech Has
Developed Into a Prize Attraction
for Spectators.
Metaphorically speaking there appear
to be quills on Edward J. Livernasb.
Judge J. C. B. Hebbard and his attorneys
surveyed the newspaper man very critic
ally yesterday afternoon, and concluded
immediately that he was a legal porcu
pine which they were not quite ready to
quill. This rather upset the programme
in more ways than one in the Marriott
libel case.
It was not Livernash's fault. He was
in court for sacrifice at the appointed
hour, but at the last moment Attorney
Julius Kahn and Assistant District Attor
ney Hmkle concluded to postpone matters
for a day or two at least. He desired
further consultation with his client's
friends, ex- Receiver John F. Sheehan of
the People's Home Savings Ban* and his
confidential ana trusted friend, James
Aiva Watt. The lawyer was proiuse with
excuses. He had beeu very busy, so had
Judge Hebbard, >o had John F. Sneehan,
und Livernash's testimony came so sud
denly, ergo would the court be gracious
enough to give him twenty-four hours
more to study the newspaper man's story?
Judge Daingerrield did as he was asked
after Attorney iShortndae, in behalf of
Editor Marriott, interposed no serious ob
jection. And so Kahn and Hebbard were
another twen'.y-four hours to
t-harpen their weapons preparatory to their
dissection of a very interesting and reada
ble chapter of tne iuside manipulations of
the bank's al'iairs.
The case is a, prize attraction now and
draws a crowded courtroom at every ses
sion. A battle as it is for the right of one
man to criticize the carniidacy of another
lor a t>oink::: "face or, to be more explicit,
tne right ot E.mor Marriott to intimate
that Judge liebbard was more or leÂ«s
morally responsible for John F. Saeehan's
management of tlie affairs of the savings
bank, it presents many interesting issue?.
The men that controlled the bank for
nearly two years in defiance of the wishes
of stockholders and depositors do not
relish the revelations that are daily being
developed.
James Aiva Watt and John F. Sheehan
are ever close a i hand to fill any breach
that threatens danger to the cause of
Judge Hebbard, who is resenting ai the
County's expense the insinuation that ha
is the "tool" and "creature" of these two
friends. Throughout the case are run
ning echoes ol'the last political campaign
and the connection Oi Judge Hebbard
witn the men in charge of me savings
bank after its light went out. Somenow
or other these reminiscences seem painful
to tne Hebbard clique, and scarcely a
â witness is allowed to answer a question
until the lawyer- have exhausted every
method of quibbling known to law and
courts. As a result, the case is proceed
ing slowly.
Benjamin F. Lucy, who wai the first
witness of the day, said that just a lew
day? previous to the time when Hebbard
procured the Indictment of the member*
of the depositors' committee, who issued
a circular opposing his candidacy for re
election to the bench, he was approached
at his place in the shops of the Union
Iron Works by John damage, a private
detective in Hebbard' s employ. Gamage
acted mysteriously, but finally requested
Lucy to call at the office of Attorneys W.
T. Bazgett and henry Eickoff. It was
a sort of fool's errand, thought the toun
dryrnan, and he paid no attention to the
detective's request. When Attorney
Shortridge attempted to establish the fact
that both Bazgett and Eickoff were attor
neys for Hebbara he stirred up a veritable
hornets' nest.
A. B. Fraesch, another committeeman,
related the efforts of the committee to se
cure the election of a board of directors
favorable to the interests of the depos
itors. After the members of the old board
bad signined their intention to step down
and out the depositor's committee met
and canvassed various names a-t their suc
cessors. The selections being made,
Fraesch said application was made to
Judge Hebbard to inouify the injunction,
but with no effect. Attorney Suoriridge
desired to draw from the witness the
various manipulations oi Sheehan and
Watt to thwart the wishes of the depos
itors. This was a tender spot to Judge
Hebbard. and Attorney Kahn succeeded
i:i having this portion oi an interesting
story shut off.
The attempt of Hebbard and Sheehan
to break into the meeting of the bank de
positors at the Jiush-street Theater on the
Saturday evening preceding the last elec
tion was the reason for the appear
ance on the stand of Aivlrew EL
Jenkins, who was the doorkeeper on the
occasion, and the cause of many inter
ruptions on t tie part oi Kuhn. Entrance
to the meeting was by bankbook, and sup
posed to be confined to depositors. Shee
han and Sam K. Thornton put in an ap
pearance first an-.l presented bankbooks
which, according to Jenkin>, were "so
new as to excite his suspicions" that
everjthing was not right. A few mo
ments iater Jud^e Hebbard came along
and beckoned to Serjeant Cook for a
private conference. After some parley
ing Cook assisted Hebbard through the
door in spite of Jenkins' protest.
"I asked him for his bunk book," said
Jenkins, "but he waved me aside unier
the orotection of the police sergeant and
passed in."
Attorney Shortridjje, after elicitin? the
information tntil Hebbard had no right in
the meeting; made an effort to have
Jenkins repeat the attempts of Hebbaid's
friemis to ureak up the meeting, but this
was such an unpleasant narrative to Knhn
that Judge Daingerrield granted his re
quest to stop the testimony.
' . Herry S. Htedman was one of the three
depo-itors who were induced by Secretary
C. E Palmer to sign a petition in Shee
ban's behalf to retain him as receiver in
6pito of tie protest of the majority of
those who bad money in the bank. Sted
man subsequently, upon learning for
what purpoue bis signature bad been se
cured, wrote a letter to Judge Hebbard,
informing him that he wished to with
draw his name. Stedman had no copy of
the communication, and, &â * Kahn de
clared Hebbard did not remember receiv
ing it, further inquiry along thesa lines
ceased.
Attorney John L. Flournoy was called
for, but could not be found. Kahn was
for preventing Flournoy from testifying if
his story wat simply to corroborate the
narratives of Committeemen McCarthy
and Uonant relative to bheebau's man
agement of the bank's assets. Judge
Daingerheid was for ruling that if this
was the case Flournoy need not be heard.
Attorney Shortridge, however, curtly in
formed the court that he would exercise
his right to have his witnesses sworn.
By stipulation Thomas Mahoney, William
Harris and William Quatman wt-re ex
cused from being cahed, the Hebbard
faciion agreeing ttiat their evidence would
corroborate that of McCarthy and Conant.
Thomas S. Williams Jr., one of the
directors of the bank, was called to tell
something about the circumstances at
tending a transaction between the Kansas
City Real Estate Association and the bank,
in which Watt was paid $250 for an exten
sion of time on the association's indebted
ness of $35, 000.
Another protest went up from the Heb
bard faction. Judge Daingerrield asked
if it was proposed to prove that Judge
Hebbard knew of this transaction.
"We are accused," said Attorney Bhort
ridge, "in our ulleged libel of saying that
Judge Hebbard's inaction caused widows
ana orphans to lose money. We are pre
pared to show that t!ie assets of this bank
were depreciated. We will prove that this
took piace witn the knowledge of Judge
Hebbard, who, as we contend, was morally
responsible for the action. Now, if it be
true that through Sheenan there was a
loss to the depositors, and that this was
done after Judge Hebbard had been ad
vised of and warned against his servant's
doings, by open letter, resolutions and pe
titions, we may contend that he is mor
ally responsible for the losses of the bank."
"Do you know if Sheehan, as receiver,
drew money without an order of court?"
Kahn interposed an objection wiih suc
cess.
Attorney Shortridge desired to learn if
Williams knew that Sheeban had been
allowed money by Judge Hebbard, which
action the Supreme Court declared null
and void.
Also Attorney Kahn would not soe
his client impaled in this manner. He
objected with both hands at once, apd
Judge Daingerneld would fain grant his
request.
"Do you know if Receiver Sheehan
drew money from the bank's assets be
fore authorized to do so by either Jud<;e
H board or thwboard of directors?"
Kahn was shocked again, and the court
poured more balm in his nerves by refusing
to permit Williams to answer the question.
It was slow work, but Attorney Short
ridge finally drove a center shot when he
inquired from Williams if he thought that
Judge Hebbard was aware of these facts.
"Certainly," was the reply. "Attorney
Bartnett, in behalf of the California Safe
Deposit and Trust Company, objected to
allowing Sheehan money in his cour\"
Assemblyman George W. Dixon was
called to give the details of a certain in
terview tetween himself and Attorney
Watt in the Union League rooms at the
time Dixon was selected as a candidate
for director by tne depositors.
"Did Watt ask you to retain him as at
torney for the bank?" queried Attorney
Shortridge.
Kami disputed the question.
"Did he likewise ask you to vote for his
retention as attorney for the bunk?"
Kahn again successfully "objected."
"Did Watt say t.'iat you did not favor
Sbeehan and himself â that he would see
that the injunction was not modified, and
that the old board would not be allowed to
resign?"
The reply to this Hebbard's attorney
managed to prevent. Dixon could :mt re
member if at this time Judge Hebbard
had been asked to modify the injunction
allowing Directors McDonald, Jenkins,
Strauss and Boushey to resign, as they de
sired to. Watt's political afli iations for
Hebbar.i were familiar to Dixon. He
knew that the two had long been friends
and active workers in campaigns.
"Did Watt say that he was a particu
larly warm friend of Judge HebbarJ, and
that unless he was provided for he would
use his influence with the Judge to pre
vent a modification of the injunction?"
This was a red rag to Kahn and Heb
bard, and a lively wrangle ensued to pre
vent Dixon giving his reply. Judge
DainKertiehl finally sustained Kahn's ob
jections and Dixon was dismissed without
further examination.
Judge S. C. Denson gave some side lights
on a transaction between himself and the
bank in September, 1894. Judge Denson,
as attorney for the Lower Kings River
Reclamation District, got a judgment in
default of unpaid assessments, amount
ing with interest to about $2500, against a
Mrs. Humphreys. Aoout the same time
the bank foreclosed a mortgage for $2Q,00u
on the same property. The affair was ar
ranged amicably by selling the property
for the amount of the two claims. Jurlee
Denson related that after the bunk failed
he settled his claim for $ISOD.
Attorney Shortridge was anxious to
show thnt the books of the bank showed
that $2500 had been diverted to pay the
reclamation judgment, but again Kahn
threw himself in the breach, and the
jurors will have to wait another day to
learn what became of tho difference be
tween these two sums.
The refusal of Hebbard's attorneys to
cross-examine Livernash at the appointed
time wai the cause of much confusion.
Attorney Shortridge exDected tnat this
work would occupy the entire afternoon
and had excused many of his witnesses.
Judge Uaiiigerrield promised that such a
hitch would not be allowed to occur aeain.
After searching for Deputy County Clerk
Fitzgerald about the City Hall, only to
learn he was "downtown," Attorney
bhortridge put Dr. Frea W. Harris on the
stand to relate Watt's attempt to swing
the physician's influence In favor of him
self and bheeuan.
"Did you have a conversation with Watt
in June, 1894?"
"Yes, Wait called to see me."
"Had you at that time consented to
serve as a director in the bank if the in
junction was modified so as to allow the
old bonrd to resign?"
"Yei, sir."
"Did Watt ask of you your vote or in
fluence in Sheehan's favor if eiected?"
Kahn objected.
"Did he say that unless you did consent
to act favorably to tne interests of Shee
han ana himself he would . 'see to it
ihat his influence with Judge Hebbarn
would prevent the injunction bafng modi
fied?"
Kahn again made a protest and Judge
Daingerfield would not allow the ques
tion. The case goes on this morning,
when the bank books will be examined.

OF NOMENCLATURE
The Old - Time Steamer
Sirius Again Changes
Her Name.
Will Now Run Opposition on the
Puget Sound and Alaskan
Route.
Big Cut in the Steamer Rates From
Ccast Ports for the Christian
Eadeavorers.
The old-time steamer Sirins has taken a
new lease of life and a new captain is in
command of her. Several years ago she
came to this port with a general cargo,
ana later on was placed in the South
American trade. The venture was not a
success, and when the vessel changed
hands she was ivchristened the Scandi
navia. Hot next venture was in the sugar
trade ana her name was changed to the
Kahului. The new owners found that
there was no money in the island trade,
and for nearly a year the steamer has been
tied up in Oakland Creek. Last week she
received a thorough overhauling, Captain
Hall, late of tne Corona, was placed in
command of her, and in a few dayÃ she
will start on the Puget Sound route. She
is now under tne American flag and will
be known in future as the Cleveland. The
Lakme will run in connection with the
new steamer, and opposition to the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company on the Sound
route is now in order.
In connection with the meeting of the
Christian -Endeavor Association to be
held in San Francisco next July the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company has issued
tne following special rate circular:
Puget Sound route, from San Francisco to
Tacoma. Seattle, Port Townsend and Victoria

Tacoma June 27, until aud including the sail

steamer Walla Walla July 20. 1897.

Another attempt is to be made to dis
cover the guano island that the Moonlight
went In search of Jaat year. On that occa
sion Captain Spencer ianaed his vessel in
a South American port and finally re
turned to this port with a cargo of guano,
which was not procured on the island In
auestion. According .to him a volcanic
eruption sank the island to the bottom of
the sea. J. A. Magee Jr., however, has
still faith in the deposit and is now fitting
out the schooner Luisa L> to make an
other search for the spot. CaDtain Fred
Erratt, who was mate of the Moonlight,
will go out as master of the little sealing
schooner and if no guano island is located
the crew will put in their time*"huntlng
sea otter and seals.
The steam - schooner Navarro has
changed hands and Captain F. Higgins
will go out in command of her.
Business is picking up on the water
front, and a number of vessels are going
into commission again. To-morrow the
Alcazar will be brought ever from Oak
land Creek to have new boilers put in.
She will go into the coast trade again.
Work on the new City front receiving
hospital will begin to-day. Chief Engi
neer Holmes has the plans all ready, and
before the In of next month an ambu
lance and a full corps of attendants will
be Btalioned on the water front. Acci
dents on East and adjoining streets will
be attended (o at the ferries in future,
thus saving the long trip to the new City
Hall.
The old Enoch Talbot is going back
into her old trade again. ' Years ago she
carried lumber from the Sound to San
Francisco, but latterly she was turned
into an oil ship. The venture did not
prove a success, and now the oil tanks
are to bo taken out, the vessel cleaned up
and again put into the lumber trade.
ON THE ENGINE
Passengers Thus Traveling Cannot Re-
cover insurance Against Accident*.
Two important in regard to
life insurance were considered in Judge
Hunt's court yesterday during the trial of
the case of Mrs. Mary I. Berliner against
the Travelers' Insuiance Company for
$2'),000 said to be due because of insurance
on the life of her late husband.
There were two counts in the com
plaint, one lor $20,000 on account of an ac
cident policy ana another for $5000 on a
life Dolicy.
In the course of the testimony the fact
was developed that Berliner was killed by
a raiirood accident in Mexico in Decem
ber, 1895, and that at the time of the acci
dent he was riding on the engine.
This being shown, the defendant cor
poration moved for a nonsuit so far as
the accident poi oy for $20,000 was con
cerned, on the ground ttiat ihe engine
was not the ordinary place' for a pas
senger, and that Mr. Berliner was not
insured against accident except while
traveling in the usual way.

authorities, Judjre Hunt held that the
point was well taken and granted the
motion for a nonsuit on the $iO.OOO claim.
In regard to tne claim of $5000 for lire
insurance an objection to paying it was
made by AY. W. Hask-Jl, a eni for the
company, who swore that thÂ«re was no
money i;aid as premium on the policy.
Attorney Daniel Titus showed that the
po icy was delivered to Mr. Berliner, and
read a letter which tended to prove that
tnere was an unÂ«ier"tan(iinÂ£j in regard to
giving credit to Mr. Berliner for the
premium. Mr. Titus declared that Mr.
Haskell had not given fair testimony in
the case, and insisted that the widow was
entitled to recover the lif" insurance.
The jury, composed of William J. Arm

Theodore P. Schaller, 11. H. Heckman

i rented local racegoers to one of the
refreshing reversals of form fur
; sh*d in quite an age. The past few
of the "Babe" would not indicate
-he had much chance to capture the
â ::M in which she was entered (the last),
htl the ring opened her up at 12 10 1. It
#aa a mile selling affair, for which Judge
â¢:ny closed a 2 to 1 choice, with Strath
and Mercutio fancied in the order
.mcd. Babe Murphy strolled leisurely
;ck in the betting until she touched 25 to
.. when the coin went in and her odds
- were speedily reduced to 10. Bozemau
rushed her to the front when the barrier
was raised and tne mare won all the way,
beating out Strathiol easily in 1:41. Hen
v.essy landed Judge Denny in thud place
i:i a drive.
Crotchety as the racing was first
choices managed to take three of the
events decided. The attendance and bet
ting was good.
The mile and a furlong purse simmered
down to a duel between Buckwa and
Ostler Joe, the other entries being
scratched. If prognostications counted .
for anything;, Buckwa. with his 118
rounds in the saddle, was a "moral," and
Purser's horse was 13 to 20 in the ring. .
wDiie against the "Montana Domino" 13 !
to 10 was laid. He carried but 102 pounds,
and setting the pace from the outset won
Very easily in t:.e announced time of 1:53, i
clipping one-quarter of a second off the i
Caiiiornia record. The winner was clev- i
>:â : . ridden by Joe Piggott.
Eighteen selling platers strolled to the
in the opening live and a lialf fur
long scramble. With Roltaire in the
la of the undertakers, it looked Tery
roÂ»y for the 11 to o choice Taranto, which
allowed to make his own pace and
won easily from the 12 to 1 shot, Gold
B.a-. Snider permitted Roltaire to take j
the show.
The Cheat and Towanda both opened at i
5 to 2 in the betting in the four-furlong
two-year-old scramble. The Cheat re
ceded to 7 to 2, while Towanda wa3 \
pounded down to Stos. Barney Schreiber, |
â an 8 to 1 shot, led all the way, beating
the favorite, which was away poorly, over
a length at the end in 49 seconds. Saticoy 1
was a close third.
Opening a 2to 1 favorite for the mile |
and a sixteenth, Lovdai showed signs of j
lameness and went buck to 10 "to 1.
Backed from 6 down to lb to 5. Ransom, \

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 6, 1897.
HIS NERVOUSNESS
SAVED HIS LIFE
John O'Meara's Unsuccess
ful Attempt at
Suicide.
Was Assistant Cashier of the
New York Life Insur
ace 3 Company.
Overwork Drove Hm Temporarily
Insaneâ His Wound Not Con
sidered Dangerous.
Overwork, continued on week days and
on Sundays, broke down the constitution
of young John E. O'Meara, assistant
cashier of the New York Life Insurance
Company, and hi 3 mind gave way under
the strain.
That is why he attempted to kill him
self yesterday b? firing a bullet in the di
rection of his heart. Being nervous the
muzzle of the revolver wobbled and the
bullet, after entering below the left nipple,
was deflected by a rib from its inward
course and passed downward between the
skin and the rib, Emerging: about four
inches below the point of entranca.
He walked into his office, room 20, In
the Mills building, at 9 o'clock in the
morning and seemed to be in his usual
spirits. Cnshier Fred G. Redding was en
gaged in looking over the morning's mail
in the adjoining room. O'Meara had not
been in room 20 for more than five min
utes when Mr. Redding heard the report
o! a pistol. He ran in and saw O'Meara
lying on the floor with a revolver beside
him. His office coat and shirt on the left
side were blood stained.
"I wish to make a dying statement,"
said O'Meara, "and that is that I am not
short 1 cent in my account?."
Mr. Redding helped the young man to
rise to his feet and assisted him to a lounge
in Manager McLane's room.
In the meantime, the report of the
revolver had attracted the attention of
several persons passing along the corridor,
and in response to their demands for ad
mission, Mr. Redding ordered them off
the premises. He denied that any one had
been shot or that a firearm had been Gis
charged at all. This falsehood naturally
caused the bystanders to be;ieve that Mr.
Redding was trying to conceal a crime,
and they went down stairs and called for
the police. Mr. Kedd:ng attempted to
keep out even the police, but the three
patrolmen who were summoned by the
alarm convinced him that they had aright
to investigate an affair which lrom the
mystery sought to be thrown around it
might have been an attempt at murd r.
Young o' jleara was able to walk with
out difficuay and was escorted to the Oc
cidental Hotel, and shortly afterward to
room 51 in the Lck Honbe, where Drs. P.
J. H. Farrell. E. N. Johnson and W. E.
Martin examined the- wounJ and dressed
it. He was then removed in a hack to
his residence, on the southwest corner of
Bush and Laguna streets, where be re
sides vrith his parents and his sister.
Wflen the reporters called at the office
of the New York Life Insurance Company
they were told by Mr. Redding and every
one else of whom tney inquired that there
was no truth whatever in the report that
a pistol had been h'red or that any one
had been shot. Charles A. McLane,
agency director for the company, how
ever, was wise enough to make a plain
statement, which made the attempts at
mystery on the part of the ethers all the
more ridiculous.
He denied that young O'Meara had
been short In his accounts. The books
had been experted only two or three
weeks ago, and the account? of the assist
ant cashier were found absolutely correct.
O'Meara had Deen working very hard and
his nervous system had begun to break
down, bo much so that tie was given a va
cation. He came back from his vacation
about three weeks ago, and there was not
much improvement in his condition. Re
cently a physician bad been prescribing
for him.
The pistol with which the shooting was
done belonged to McLane, and was left in
a drawer in his office. The drawer was
not locked, and O'Meara under a mo-,
mentary attack of insanity seized it and
shot himself.
"I came back from the East recently,"
added Mr. McLane, "and I greeted
O'Meara very cordially. That, perhaps,
may have made him suspect that he was
not giving satisfaction or that there was
something wrong about his accounts. He
had been worrying lately about some
missing vouchers lor something like 10 or
15 cents apiece, paid to agents for postage,
etc., and which the agents had neglected
to send. He had the handling of pre
miums paid in and checks, so that if
there was a shortage it could not have
been large. But there was no shortage
whatever. He was oversensitive, and his
nerves were unstrung. That was what w^s
the matter v.ith him."
Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara and Migs O'Meara
declined to allow the reporters to sea the
wounded man. They said his mind had
given way temporarily on account of over
work. They said he worked ap to 10
o'clock nearly every night, and that he
worked on Sundays as well. He had been
under the care of Dr. Leonard lor some
weeks, they said.
Miss O'Meara, hi 9 sister, said his actions
and speech recently showed bo much de
rangement that she had intended to have
had him examined yesterday evening to
ascertain whether ho was sane or not.
Tiie young man had been connected
with the New York Life Insurance Com
pany for many years, beginning work
there as an office boy. He had held the
position of assistant cashier lor about
three years.
NOTHING CAN BE DONE
The People Who Blew Vp Heidtman'g
-.il-.i.n Will Go Scot Free.
Fire Marsha! Towe is 'as much in a
quandary over the explosion that shat
tered C. F. Heidtman's saloon at Folsom
and Twenty-sixth streets Tuesday morn
ing as he was when Georpe Carroll's drug
store blew up one month ago at Hayes
and Market streets.
"I can make no arrests in these cases,"
stated the marshal yesterday, "for I have
no absolute proof of guilt on which to con
vict.
"As a matter of fact Heidtman's place
was blown up by means of dynamite, and
everything would indicate that it was not
au accident. Tbis morning I found empty
shells six inches lons, that must have con
tained some explosive, in the ruins of the
building. Heidtman declares that these
shells never were in bis possession.
"I find also that Henry Webner, the
barkeeper, tells a rather nsuy story of his
connection with tbe tire and explosion.
He first claimed to bave been knocked
out of bed, burned and badly bruised. In
that condition he says he ran four blocks
to Heidtmar.'s house. Several witnesses
testify that immediately alter the explo
sion Wehner was fully dressed and on "the
street.
"However, tbe proof of|cuilt is not suffi
ciently strong for me to charge these
people with arson."

A DAY OF SHARP
LEGAL FENCING
Notarial Blanks Are Not
Yet Evidence in the
Fair Case.
Attorneys for Mrs. Craven
Cleverly Outpoint the Op
posing Forces.
C erk Stanford of the H. S. Crocker
Company Was on the Stani
Throughout the Session.
To the uninitiated observer aud listener
yesterday's proceedings in the Fair-
Craven case were dull and devoid of
interest. Just one witness, William E.
Stanford of the H. S. Crocker Company,
occupied the stand throughout the day,
and his was not a new face, for it had
been seen in court on the two previous
days of the hearing ami both .times as a
witness. And besides his testimony de
veloped nothing of a startling value.
But, while the case was apparently
dragging and droning and the same ques
tions were seemingly being asked over
and over again, and the same arguments
being made by the attorneys, there was
an undercurrentâ purely technical and at
timesalmost indistinguishableâ in motion
which when analyzed exposed one of the
prettiest contests of legal fencing that has
taken place in a local courtroom for years.
In fact one of the most important battles
of the trial was waging, and while victory
seems to perch upon the defense's stand
ard tne smoke has not yat cleared away
and there will bs more of it to-day when
Judge Slack bugles the charge.
It was ail over the attempts of the at
torneys for executors of the Fair estate â
the plaintiffs in this action to determine
the validity of Mrs. Nettie Craven's deeds
to two valuable parcels of property claimed
by the estateâ to squeeze in evidence that
was declared by the court to be inadmis
sible.
They tried and tried, by every hook
and crook, by every play known to the
game of law, to achieve their purpose, and
were still pegging away when the adjourn
ment was taken.
It was thus that the entire day slipped
away and nothing was accomplished prac
tically, save the masterly defense put ud
by the attorneys for Mrs. Craven, led by
D. M. Delmas.
The evidence sought to be Interjected
was that by which the plaintiff's side de
sired to prove thai Notary J. J. Cooney's
acknowledgments of Mrs. Craven's deeds
were executed on blanks that were printed
by the Crocker establishment several
months after the date of those acKnowl
edgments and at a time when Cooney had
ceased to be a notary. This evidence
comprises copies of those blanks, and
proofs also, w:Â»ich are alleged to show
typographical defects peculiar only to the
series printed on that subsequent date.
The story of the plaintiffs s-ide is that
Captain Lees of the Police Department
and others discovered these defects, and
that Witness Stanford also noted them.
Attorney McEnerney's energies were cen
tered in endeavoring to prove the alleged
fact by Stanford, and thus save Lees from
tbe torture of the witnest-stand. It seems
to be a foregone conclusion that the new
Chief of Police will not take the stand un
less his presence is absolutely necessary,
for everybody knows that be will De in for
a great scorching at the bands of the de
fense if he takes the step. This because
the charge has already been made by the
attorneys for Mrs. Craven that Lees and
other officers under him, ia the employ of
the City, have been taking sides in the
case, despite the fact that it is merely a
civil proceeding.
But Stanford was not equal to the occa
sion and the day was lost to the plain
tiffs. This witness was williug enough,
but his testimony proved to be of a hear
say nature anu was therefore not ad
mitted despite the frantic efforts made to
net it in.
Attorney Pieraon was still on the sick
list when court opened yesterday morn
ing, so Garret McEnerney acted as chief
counsel and questioner for the plaintiffs.
Judge Denson aid the cross-examining
for the defense during the forenoon, but
was succeeded in the later session by Mr.
Delmas. Stanford's testimony under the
forenoon cross-examination was in chief
as to the details of conducting the legal
blank department in the Crocker estab
lishment
Ou redirect examination Stanford pro
duced a copy of a notarial blank that was
printed after January 8, 1896. It went
into evidence without objection.
An effort was then made to put into evi
dence Stanford's order-book, but an objec
tion met it, ana there was quite an argu
ment. As it was now tim 3 for the noon
recess, Judge SlacK said he would not de
cide the point until court reconvened.
In the afternoon he gave his ruling on
the objection to the offer ot the entry
book. His Honor said he had carefully
looked up the authorities, and was satis
fied that the objection to the book was
good and should be sustained.
Mr. McEnerney essayed by several dif
ferent routes known to the craft to get the
book in, but ull to no purpose. The book
had to stay out.
Stanford was asked to positively identify
the proof of an acknowledgment blank
that was printed on or about the Bth of
January, 1896. In doing this he endeav
ored to get in some additional evidence,
and had to be admonished by the court.
Stanford then said he could only recog
nize and identify the proof because he re
membered having looked it up in Novem
ber, 1896, for Attorney Pierson, and hav
ing with him compared it with a blank
thai had been used as the original copy.
Mr. McEnsrney then offered the proof in
evidence, but met with another objection.
An argument followed in which Messrs.
Delmas, Wheeler and McEnerney indulged
in some clever legal fencing. Mr. Mc-
Enerney announced that he proposed to
prove the proof of ihe copies printed in
January, 1896, would show certain defects
in type and general construction that ap
pear on the Cooney acknowledgment al
leged to have been executed in Septem
ber, 1894. This, he declared, would be
strong evidence ttat the deeds held by
Mrs. Craven were not genuine.
Mr. Delmas objected to this statement.
He said Mr. McEnerney had no right to
talk that way in the presence of the jury.
"A superficial scrutiny of this proof and
blank," he said, "will render what was a
bungling imitation appear to be identical.
Others have made a more careful ex
amination of them than has Mr. Mc-
Enernoy and have found them to be
wholly differentâ and a very poor imita
tion at that. What does this witness
know about this proof? He cannct Bwear
that it is a proof at all. He says he found
it in a package in the printing-room and
does not know whether it is the original
proof or one put there subsequently for a
purpose. ''
Judge Slack ruled that Mr. Delmas was
right and would not admit the proof.
Stanford now went DacK to Mr. Delmas
for another siege of cross-examination.
In answer to that gentleman* questions
he said that some time after Mr. Pierson
visited the stationery-store C. H. Crocker
directed him to open some packages of
the reserve stock of acknowledgment
blanks and furnish him with samples.
These packages were kept in a bir. at the
rear of the store. The blanks were
wrapped iv ordinary nianiila paper, the
corners being held down by blotches of
seaiing-wax. Ttiere were no identification
impressions on this wax. The bin, too,
was open and unlocked, and the witness
admitted that there would bo nothing to
prevent their removal by any one so dis
posed connected with the establishment.
The witness did not see the blanks in
question printed. Tney were delivered to
him by Foreman Yon Ahn of the print
ing department, already wrapped, num
bered and sealed.
Stanford, replying now to Mr. McEn
erney's queries, said he and Captain Lees
examined these blanks several weeks
after Mr. Pierson's visit with a magnify
ing glass. A question as to what this ex
amination disclosed was sliut off by an
objction, Mr. Delmas showing the court
that it vras a violation of the rules of evi
dence. The original document would
have to be produced, so the jury could
make the comparisons and conclude as to
the disclosures; otherwise it would have
to be ordered that tnose particular blanks
had been lost or destroyed.
Mr. McEnerney tried to get relief by ask
ing Stanford regarding the whereabouts of
i Muse blanks, but failed again, as Stanford
could not state where they were. He
only supposed that Mr. Pierson had them.
After quite a deal of sparrinir McEn
erney got the witness to sny that there was
a defective letter "o" in the blanks
printed on January 8, 1896, and that this
was the subject of several conversations
between himself and Mr. Crocker and be
tween himself and Captain Leee.
An adjournment was here taken until
this morning.
HIS WIFE NOT JEALOUS.
Sirs. Is. B. Goldberg Without Doubt
Took Carbolic Acid Through
Mistake.
L. B. Goldberg, whose wife took carbolic
acid with supposed suicidal intent on ac
count of jealousy during- a recent trip of
tbe husband to Salt Lake, denies and
quotes good authority for hia denial
either tbat he had taken another woman
with nua to Salt Lake or that his wife
(suspected him of iniidelity or knew that
she was taking poison.
Me says that his wife and he had been
in the habit of gargling, using twenty
drops of the acid in a tumblerful of water
for sore throa:; that on the ni^ht in ques
tion she gargled with a slightly larger
quantity than usual and left the glass and
the remainder of the water on the table
near the bed, nnd growing thirsty during
the nijrht drank it without thinking that
it was the water she had used for sore
throat.

"Lows' 1 usually first appear on the Washington

north and south itlonir the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low is inclosed with isobar, of

REFUSED TO ACT
Says Secretary Thomas
Gave Him Inaccurate
Information.
Two More Appointments Are
Made on the Board of
Health.
Special Meeting Called for To-Night,
at Which the Programme May
Go Through.
Oakland Oftcie San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, May 5. \
Tfie Board of Health ia at last com
pleted. This afternoon Mayor Thomas
filed the appointment o! Drs. H. A. L.
Kyfkoeel and John P. Kitchings, who,
â¢with., Drs. Chamberlain, Itucker and
Eaton, now compose the board. With the
exception of Dr. Chamberlain ell are al
lopaths.
Dr. G. E. Brinckerhoff, who was ap- i
pointed Saturday and resigned yesterday,
tells a most peculiar story of the manner
in which he was induced to accept the ap
pointment. His statement shows that the
work was done by Harry Thomas, secre
tary of the Board oi Work?, acting for bis
father, the Mayor.
"I resigned because I found that I had
been misinformed 8S to the situation of
affairs at the time of my appointment,"
said Dr. Brinckerhoff to-day. "In reeard
to Dr. Pierce, the veterinaiy surgeon, 1
objected to his being put out of otiice, bui
1 was told by the Mayor's secretary, Harry
Thomas, that Dr. Pierce was not in the
contest, that he had no idea of being per
mitted to retain oflice, and that he had
worked against the election of Mayor
Thomas. I have since learned that these
statements were not true. Dr. Pierce al
ways has been an applicant for reappoint
ment, and be worked in tbe interests of
Captain Thomas during the campaign.
"This phase of the situation is a serious
one, because Dr. Pierce is a friend of mine
and has the reputation of being one of the
beit posted men in the State on tuber
culosis, and I know that he has rendered
this city invaluable service while in
office.
. "I cannot 8 fiord to put myself in the
position of endangering the health and
i.yes of the children, especially by voting
to put capable men out of office, when I
know that they worked on behalf oi the
Ilepublican ticket.
"In advance of my appointment the
name of Mr. Snow for secretary was pre
sented to me, and to him I had no objec
tion. Then Dr. Dunn's name for Health
' iilicer was presented. To this I objected,
Lvi young Thomas said that it must be
l>r. D.unn or the whole board would be
given to the homeopaths. There is a
bitter warfare just now in this city be
tween the regulars and the homeopaths,
and rather ttian see the board be given to
the homeopaths I agreed to Dunn.
"Finally Harry Thomas presented to
me a list, of names already written out.
When I saw it I particularly objected to
Dr. Pierce being superseded, but upon the
representations to which I have referred
1 cave way. 1 did not see tbe Mayor at
all during the negotiations until Satur
day, when our appointments weie formally
raade. We met that afternoon and car
ried out the programme as previously ar
ranged.
Â "The Mayor was opposed to my resigna
tion and suggested a compromise regard
ing some of the appointments of the board.
Jut I would not consent to this. When I
found that I had not been correc'.ly in
formed, I made up my mind to resign and
have nothing more to do with the Board
of Health."
A special meeting of the board will be
held to-morrow night. There will be a
political rumpus should an attempt be
mad' to appoint a Democrat to succeed
i>r. Pierce, as the Republican platform
contained a strongly worded plank con
damning inch action. Now that it is
known that the Mayor, tbrough his son,
ip suggesting to the doctors certain people
to fill the offices within the gift of the
board, it is not believed that the pro
gramme of last Saturday will be carried
cut in its entirety.

TO BEAUTIFY THE PARK.
Many Competitors Anxious to
Win the Board of Works'
Prizes.
The Great Dream of John P. Irish I>
About toÃr Realized on tbe West
Oakland Marsh.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
UOS Broadway, May 5. j
The Board of Worfcs had a very agree
able task this morning. When it met its
desks were covered with some elaborate
and artistic plans for the adornment of the
West Oakland Park.
Tlie board offered a prize for the design
that was most acceptable, and eleven com
petitors submitted tfceir efforts in twelve
colored drawings which were opened to
day. Two of the designs are particularly
attractive, though it would cost a erood
sum of money to carry them out
These plans provide for a large flapst&ff
in the center, a grand triple fountain, a
music pavilion, an observatory three
stories high, concourse grounds, an open
ampitheater with seats, baseball grounds,
tennis lawns, cafe creamery, bicycle track,
gymnasium, conservatory, twin lakes,
bridges, police stations, drinking-foun
ains, grotto, parade around, aquarium,
sheds and electric lie lit pole 3.
Ti is is about all that can well becrowded
on the eleven acres purchased by the city,
but it is hoped that an equal amount of
land to the north, reaching as far as
Twenty-second street, will soon be added
to tne West Oakland Park. Another very
beautiful plan is that of Leon Boiliot, tne
newspaper artist.
The contractors are ready to begin work
at once on filling in the marsh, and, as
the dredger in use has proved to be very
powerful, it will not be many months be
fore the great dream of John P. Irish's
life has been realized.
SCHOOLS TOR PRUITVALE.
District Development Demands the Is-
suauce of Bonds.
OAKLAND, Cal., May s.â On the 22d
of May a bond election will be held in the
Fruitvale School District. Owing to the
growth of the district a new school has
become an absolute necessity in the lower
end. The big building in the upper part
of Fruitvale is full and cannot accommo
date the children of the whole district.
Applications for admission to the school
have had to be denied for some time be
cause of lack of room.
The trustees own a lot on Twenty- sixth
avenue and the bonds to the amount of
$10,000, if voted for, will be used to erect
on this lot a building suitable to the pres
ent needs and future requirements of
Southern Fruhvale.

not as yet acquired a tire department, but
an engine was sent from this city, and
although too late to save the shed It did
save the schoolhoase.
Two stables in the rear of the school
hou<>Â«Â» were also destroyed. A filly valued
at $500 was burned to death in one of the
staoles, and the hor*e Toano broke her
fastenings and ran off with her blanket on
fire, and was not caught for several hours.

OAKLAND, Cal., May s.â Another
stage in the financial troubles of Monroe
Salsbury, the Pieasanton horseman, was

involuntary insolvent upon a petaion of a
number of his creditors. The petition de
clares that the Pieasanton stoci; tarm was

disadvantage of his creditors. Upon the
9howine of the creditors' attorneys Judge

said flags were at the head and foot of his children's bed so they could see it last tning at
night and first thing in the morning. Mr. Caveliier nas worked hard for the West Oakland
park, ana wants every tree on it decorated with flags. He says there is a place for everything
and the place for the flag is everywhere. In fact Councilman Cavellier's flag idea was so well
bruited during the campaign that whenever a flag was seen some one would ask "Where is
Cavelliert"
THE TESTIMONY
WAS DOCTORED
Felony Charges Against
Old William Clarke
Dismissed.
Little Msb3l Samson Had Been
Instructed in What She
Sbou d Say.
A Famous Case Speedily Disposed of
by a Jury, Wbich Was Re
quested to Acquit.
Oakland Office, San Francibco Call }
908 Uroadway, May 5. ,f
William Clark, the old man of East
Oakland charged with assaulting little
eirls, was released to-day, the jury hav
ing found him not guilty.
About a year ago this case created great
interest, owing to the manner in which
Dr. J. W. Ellis, pastor of the Centennial
Presbyterian Chureu, criticized the pro
ceedings of the Prosecuting Attorney' 3 of
I lice in the newspapers. The minister wrote
j several letters in which he alleged that
improper means were being taken to ob
tain testimony from the little girls.
Harry H. Melvin, the court prosecutor,
, indignantly denied the insinuations of
j Dr. Ellis, and at the preliminary exami
| nation Clnrk was held to answer on a
I charge of felony.
In the Superior Court to-day testimony
| was given which did not suit Mr. Melvm,
I who was conducting the case for the rro-e
--cution, and he promptly asked the Judge
to instruct the jury to acquit.
In the morning the testimony of Mabel
Swanson was taken. She made certain
statements in which she Baid she had not
been coached regarding her testimony by
any one. Other witnesses followed and
from the trend of their testimony it was
seen that the Siranson girl had been in
structed.
Later in the afternoon Mabel Swanson
was recalled and during her cross-ex
amination spoke of having forgotten cer
tain things and of having made mistakes
and of having conversations about testi
mony in which sue was to say certain
things and not to say other things, and
all this so convinced Mr. Melvin that
somebody had allowed her zeal to over
come her discretion that he therefore
asked for the prisoner's acquittal.
The court stated that it did not feel that
it was empowered to instruct the jury to
acquit, but a little later when the jury
went to the juryroom to consider their
verdict they were only absent three min
utes before they returned with a verdict
of not guilty.
Clark is 70 years of age and he has stated
all along that the evidence against him
was doctored. The tales told by the girls,
however, seem to fco particularly straight
and convincing and Clark was held under
heavy bonds.
LIGHTING THE MOLE.
n-1.-iy Caused by the Poles Being Too
Light to Carry the Wire*.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Way s.â The narrow
; gause mole will not be lighted by elec
tricity as soon as had been expected.
City Electrician Wiese has been stringing
the wires, but has found that for a portion ;
of the distance the poles are, in his
opinion, too light to stand the strain or
(he metal daring a gale of wind, and he
! tbioka they are apt to give way just at the
most inopportune lime and leave the mole
in darkness, thereby causing unjust re
> flections upon the quality of electricity
| furnisbel by ttiis city. The railroad offi-
I cials do not a^ree with him and say the
poles are heavy enough. There are only
ten poles in the gap to be covered, but
Wieee has stopped work and will not re
sume operations until the af'alr is settled
to bis satisfaction.
INDUSTRY'S TROUBLES.
A Stockholder in the Newspaper
Charges Conspiracy.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 5. âW, B. Soule
haa brought suit acainst the stockholders
of Industry, ths Populist weekly paper,
for several hundred dollars which he
claims aa wage?.
In his complaint Soule makes many
allegations against J. C. Buttner, secretary
and manager of the company, whom he
charges with having illegally gained con
trol of much of the otock and refusing to
trive Soule a share of the proftta. It is
also charged that Buttner conspired with
Messrs. Moore, Hennessy and Bnsh of the
Populist State Central Committee to cet
1600 shares, which is a majority of 3000,
mid that by so doing he could throw out
Editor Preble, and to prevent Soule from
having any share in the management. It
is alleged that the corporation did not
comply with the law and haÂ« therefore,
no legal existence, and tuat Buttner has
transferred 1000 shares to his wile to avoid
his responsibility.
CANNOT BUILD A TUNNEL.
An Unexpected Decision From the Dis
trict Attorney Dampen* the Ardor of
the Oakland Supervisors
OAKLAND, Cal., May s.â The joint
meeting of the Supervisors, the represent
atives of the Oakland and Aiameda gov
ernments, the Merchants' Exchange and
the Board of Trade to consider the tunnel
proposition was held to-night.
District Attorney Snook rendered an
opinion that was somewhat disappoint
ing to those present. He stated that
under the law the Supervisors were em
powered only to build bridges, and that
they could not assist in any undertaking
to tunnel beneath the estuary.
This opinion dampened the ardor of the
meeting, and it was decided to make an
effort to have the tunnel built by the two
cities, if possible, independent of the
county.

SECOND DAY'S SESSION
Grand Council of the Legion of
Honor Instructs Its Dele
gates.
Officers Who Will Gavern the Order
in California for the N xt
Tw i Years
Grand Commander Thomas Filben of
the Grand Council of the Le.ion of Honor
called the delegates to order for the second
day's session yesterday morning.
The delegates to the Surreme Council,
which will convene in Buffalo, X. V., next
August, were instructed by resolution as
to tne need of several amendments to the
eeneral laws. Among these is one ex
tending by filteen days the time within
which suspended members may be rein
stated; also one to favor such action as
shall allow members of the order, who
are in insurance class B, which is to be
done away with, to enter class A at any
time in the future instead of compelling
them to do so, if at all, by July 1.
A long discussion was had on a proposi
tion to so amend the suicide clause in the
insurance certificates of the oraer ns to
make it conform to the ordinary usage of
commercial insurance companies. In
other words, instead of having tue fact of
a man's death by suicide vitiate his policy
in ail cases, the amendment proposed that
it should liave no effect whatever unless
tue act of suicide took place within two
years after the issuing of the policy.
A spirit of retrenchment seized the body
in muking its appropriations lor the en
suing two years. The salary of the secre
tary was cut down from $I*2oo to $900 per
year and the contingent fund of the grand
commander from $500 to $400 per year,
while economy will be practiced in the
secretary's office wherever it can witnout
actually hampering the administration.
The per capita tax was fixed at $1 20 per
member for the next two years.
Under a special order of business the
election of officers was taken up last night.
The result was as follows:
Grand commander, Thomas Filben, Marys
ville; grand vice-commander, William Motz
ner, San Francisco; grand orator, J. H. Sea
well, Uklah; grand secretary, C. O. Burton,
San Francisco; grand treasurer, \V. H. H.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
The Vim and Spirit of "El
Capitan " Find Popu : ar
Favor.
â¢'East Lynne" Can Still Extiact
Tearsâ Disguises at the
Grand.
"El Capitan" has so much to recom
mend it that no wonder the Klein-Sousa
operetta is nightly filling the Baldwin
Theater. The stage pictures pres-nted by
the beautiful scenery and costumes are
veriiable triumphs of scenic art; the
sparkling libretto cives splendid comic
opportunities to De Wolf Hopper, of
which he avails himsblf to the utmost,
and the marches in which the score
abounds have all the wel -known Sousa
swing and crispness to them. The en
gagement of De Wolf Hopper is limited to
two weeks. Nat Goodwin follows him.
Ward and Yokes are still filling the Colum
bia Theater with amused audiences in "A
Run on the Bank." Next week they will be
succeeded by Sadie Martinot and the "Excel
sior Jr." company.
That champion tear- extractor, "East
Lynne," is proving one of the mou popular
productions that the Alcazar has seen tor
sometime; evidently age cannot wither it.
Next week a farcical comedy, "Nita's First,"
followed by Frances Power's Chinese play,
"The First Born," will be produced.
"An American Hero," at the Grand, Is an
interesting play, In which the characters as
sume an unusually large number of clover
disguises, either lor purposes of villainy or
else to foil it. The disguises are all well car
ried out, and the many scenic opportunities o(
the play are made the most of.
"Shamus O'Brien" continues to pack the
Tivoli, and the demand for seats is so heavy
that It has been resolved to prolong the opera
through next wtek. The song, "Maureen,"
which Denis O'S'jilivan has introduced into
the first act, has made a hit.
The Opheum's bill contains a long list of
popular acts. Al and Mamie Anderson have
made quite a hit with their colored specialty
turn. Fleurette arid tier four dancers have
danced ihemse!ves into the eood will of the
public, and Mile. Ani's gymnastic act is thril
ling and picturesque.
Stole a Horse and Buggy.
Robert Critcher was yesterday held to an
swer before the Superior Court by Judge
Campbell in $2000 bonds on the cnarge of
grand larceny. He was accused of stealing a
horse and buggy in January last belonging to
E. \V. Schwartz and disposing of the rig.
Police Trib mal.
The Police Commissioners met last night.
Policeman Joun P. Woest was fined $50 tor
drinking in a saloon when on duty and re
porting off duty in a drunken condition. Po
licemen H. D. Jackson and H. H. Murphy were
each fined $25 for using improper remarks

CLOCK-WINDER STRIKING
Most of the Cit7 Hall Timepieces
Have Stopped Keeping
Time.
Weuze', Denied Increased Fay, Gives
Up His Peculiar Posi
tion.
Time is money, and as he cannot get
the money he wants R. G. Wenzel, mv-
nicipal clock-winder, refuses to put in his
time on the clocks at the City Hall and
has gone on a strike. The consequence is
that two-thirds of the clocks at the City
Hall have not been running for the paat
three days and those city employes who
do not possess watches often have to go
into adjacent offices when they desire to
know whether lunch hour has arrived or
when it is- second drink time.
When the clocks stopped three days ago
a roar went up from the big building and
half a dozen departments straightway
sent notices to Wenzel tnat the timepieces
were out of repair and needed bis imme
diate attention. Tula is a sample of the
answers received:
Health Office. New Ctty Hall. )
City, May 3, 1897. j
Postal card in regard to clocks received.
They are all stopped on account of no: being
able to make arrangements with the Commit
tee on Public Buildings of the Board of Su
pervisors in regard to pay for attending to
them.
6hould yon send them notice that they
(clocks) are a necessity in your office, it may
help to have them started again. Yours, etc.,
R. G. Wenzel.
Then the plaint went in another direc
tion and reached the ear of Chairmnn
Sheehan of the Public Buildings Commit
tee, who sent it echoing bacic with in
terest.
"This man Wenzel wants the earth," he
said, "but he is not going to get the small
portion that my position as chairman of
the Public Buildings Committee gives me
a right to have a hand in.
"this City paid Wenzel $2000 several
years ago to put in a number of clocks and
then hired him at $50 a year to see that
they were kept wound. A few years later
the City Jtlall Commissioners had him put
in more clocks in newly constructed wings
and raised his pay to $10 per month or
$120 per year, more tnan double what he
originally received. When this board
came into office he made a demand for $25
a month or $300 a year and we sat on him.
â 'The demand was refused, and a few
days aco he stopped the clocks at the hour
thÂ«y now stand and turned over the keys.
It now appears that he constructed clocks
that no clockmaker, without a careiul
study of the mechanism, can understand,
and he thinks he will force the City to pay
the exorbitant price he asks because other
wise we must ?o timeless. I think we will
fool Mr. Wenzel."
Tbere are a few offices in the building
that are fortunate in not possessing Wen
zei clocks, and the employes do their own
winding, so the municipal headquarters
has a little time on its bands.

GUESTS OF
PRESIDENT
HUNTINGTON
The Railroad Magnate in
the Role of Host at
His Home.
COVERS SET FOR ABOUT
SIX SCORE.
One of the Most Elaborate j
Affairs Ever Seen in
San Francisco.
DECORATIONS OF A TASTEFUL
CHARACTER.
Spaeches and Music CLarm Away
the Hoars Until LoDg After
Midnight.
Collis P. Huntington. president of the
Southern Pacific Company, entertained
about 110 of the principal oilicers and em
vioyes of the two threat corporations with
which he is so prominently connected at
dinner last night at his residence on the
crest of Nob Hill.
It is three years since he has unbent in
this social manner. Theretofore the Hun
r.ngton dinners were a regular feature of
the magnate's annual visit to this City.
All the previous affairs were given at the
l'aiace Hotel, and partook less of a pri
vate character than the Junction of Jast
night.
In making out the list of invited guests j
great c:ire was exercised to include oniy
tentiemen who were in some capacity
connected with the Southern Pacific Com
;>.iny and its leased prop^rac, or the
JMarket- street Railway company. An
other departure from former custom was
the presence of a delegation of three
ruemoers from each of the locomotive en
gineers' and conductors' orzanizationd.
The invitations were engraved in script
type on hevel-edr.ed cards, ahout 3x4 |
inches, and read as follows:
Mr. Huntington requests the pleasure of |
company n't dinner, May 5, at half
past 7 o'clock, 1020 California street.
The euests began to arrive at the man
sion on the corner of Caliiornia and Tay
lor streets at about 0:45 f. M., in order to
pay their individual respects to Mr. Hunt
inpton before tating their seats at his
hospitable board.
The covers were set on tables arranged
in the form of a horseshoe In the art cal- I
lery, a magnificent room, twenty-two feet !
high, its walls hung with huge canvases
in handsome frames. One hundred and
forty electric lights furnished a brilliant
illumination, and elegant floral pieces set
off the ornately and richly dressed table.
Prominent among the decorations was
tne handsome siiver punch bowl, pre
sented to the host of the evening at the
last dinner by those who were present
thereat. Inscribed on it are the names of
every individual who had been invited.
Mr. Huntington is extremely proud of I
this testimonial of the friendly feelings of
the gentlemen connected with the rail
road and street railway corporations in
which he is a controlling factor. On this
occasion it was heaped full of Mme.
lestot roses, choice and beautiful pint
blossoms.
About midway on each side of the
horseshoe was a floral 3htp six feet long,
with full ringing and sails and topped
with pretty siilt flogs.
At the head of the table near where the
ho^t sat was a train of three cars, also
built of flowers, about six feet high. All
along the tables were vases of the choicest
roses grown in the State. At each guest's
plate was a dainty boutonniore. Palms
were profusely scattered about the room,
and tne floral display altogether was one
of the grandest ever seen in California.
The decorative effect of the tables was
greatly heightened by lighted yellow can
dles in handsome candeiabras with pink
shades.
The menu was all that an epicure conld
desire. It was as follows:

After due attention bad been j;iven
to tne caterer's contribution the "feast
of reason and flow of soul" began.
W. H. Mills, a pastmaster in the art of
presiding at post-prandial functions, acted
as toastmaster. and by his clever persi
flaÂ«e added to the enjoyment of the even
ing. He was introduced by President
Keqna of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company.
The first toast was, "The Health of C.
P. Huntington." To this the host re
sponded as follows:

C P. HUNTINGTON.
\Fiom his jwrtraU, which was the frontispiece of the menu card.]
I gratification of welcoming you to my
home, and again I anticipate the enjoy
ment of listening to the kindly and fra
ternal words which have always niiirked,
and I hope may ever distinguish our so
cial reunions, although I confess that 1
am selfish in this anticipation, for 1 am
sure the pleasure is more mine than yours.
"I have added to the number of our
friends this evening some representatives
of a class without which our vocations
would be gone, and the feet of our idol,
: tne railroad, would be as of clay; for what
I could the railroad do without the men
who run the engine andthetraiu? They I
have done me the honor 10 accept my
j invitation, and on behalf of all of you, as
' well as myself, 1 extend to these gentle
j men who come to us from the engineers
' and conductors of the Southern Pacific
I Company our cordial greetings.
"We all serve the same roaster â the
public I think, indeed, that of all the
classes of labor in the world, trom the
highest to the lowest, there is no body of
j men who are more immediately the ser
vants of the ppople than we. We exist for
their convenience, and we cannot live
without them.
"At the same time, it may as justly be
1 sail that without railroad men the world
! to-day might be living in huts, and Cali
: fornia herself would have little to recom
; mend her except a glorious climate and
the illusions of a pa-toral life. Since we
I are, then, at once the servants and the
] civilizers of mankind, it would seem to be
' a plain duty, in the interest of ourselves i
as of the public, that we get closer to the |
people, acquaint ourselves with their situ
ation and their needs, and, as far as pos
| sibie within the lines of our duty to the
; company, meet their requirements.
"Ihe gentlemen who represent the con
! ductors and engineers this evening come
' closer to the people than some of the rest
of us. Their responsibilities are of the
highest order, because they concern the
lives and the safety of the traveling pub
' lie. There is no higher type of hero than
j the man at the lever, who, at the supreme
â¢ moment of peril, faces a dreadful .ilterna
: tive and stands fast a: his post. No blare
I of trumpet, no roll of drum, no encour
j aeing shout of comrades, no passion and
1 excitement of battle, stimulate his cour
tage. With his engine plunging into the
! fire of a burning bridge, or into an abyss
i which yawns at his feet, orinto the wreck
! of other engines and trains like his own,
: he holds on because his duty bids him
i stay.
"It is not the fortune of most of you,
gentlemen, who are the administrative
officers of the railway company, to ever
I attain saintship by this heroic method,
: and 1 presume I could count on the lin
! gers of at least both hands the number of
; you present here to-night who honestly
! regret it. At the same time the duty reals
i upon us, as officers, to do our part in mm;
; imizing the risk sustained by the travel
-1 ing public, *o furas it enn be done through
' a perfect roadbed and equipment, and m
j teiligent management ot the properties,
' and in eliminating as tar as possible the
I danger to our trainmen.
"I huve many times expressed my pride
in tne personnel of the Southern Pacific
Company, and it lias been justified by the
letters I have received from travelers over
our lines, who have praised in the high
est terms the uniform courtesy of our
railway employes. It is only fair to say
to you, gentlemen, who are the oflicers
and heads of departments of the respec
tive companies, that I have no doubt the
: same thing has been written about your
â  selves, only the letters were probably
written to some other person, or else
I have for the moment forgotten
. tbem.
"iSince our last reunion the Nation has
elected a new President. For his predeces
sor I have alwuys had the greatest respect
because 1 have felt that while he was in the
chair the country was safe. He was a
strong man, believing firmly in his own
theories, but confronted by conditions
which prevented him from carrying out
those theories. Mr. McKinley is likewise
a strong man, and under his patriotic
guidance we have no fears for the ship of
state. His administration commences
under encouraging auspices and promico?,
and we all loot forward to the fulfillment
of the latter, which means so much of
substantial prosperity for the whole coun
try.
"Already we hear of mill? and factories
starting up ail over the East, in anticipa
tion of the good times, coming. Whether
realization or disappointment is in store
/or them no one can tell; but after all it
must be remembered that it is true in a
large degree that the restoration of busi
ness confidence means the actual revival
of business itself, for business is simply
the expression of people's confidence in
each other, and when that is lost business
languishes. I wish that the capitalist",
large and small, of California would re
spond freely to the countrj r 's call for con
fidence, for upon the utilization of capital
depend the progress and prosperity of the
State.
"Agriculture may be the basis of a na
tion's existence, but the vigor of its life
and of ita progress lies in its manu
factures. Travel over the world where
you will, and you will tinrt that the
greatest advances in those things which
make up material prosperity have been in
those countries where the thrift of the
people has been expended in manu
factures and the arts. Tho difference be
tween the value of a product in its crude
state and its value alter it has passed
tbroueh the hands of the artisan is very
great, and in some things so prodigious
as to astonish any one who has not re
flected upon it.
"In my shipyard at Newport News we
are building some great battle-ships,
weighing each 10,000 tons, and 1 get for
building one of them something over two
and a hall millions. I "hull not make
over 10 percent on it, whicli leaves more
than $2,250,000 to be distributed between
the labor and tho cost of the material used
in its construction. Of this fully $2,200,
--000 will be paid out to labor alone; so that,
of the vast total of two and a half millions,
1 verily believe that less than $50,000 rep
resents the cost of the iron in the mine,
the timber in the forest and the coal in its
bed before the wheels of commerce had
THE RAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 6, 1897.
brought it to market or the hand of man
had touched it.
"California is magnificent in her climate,
in which people can labor with the mini
mum of fatigue. Her soil is not only
prolific in agricultural produce, but rich
in the products of her mines and forests.
She is unsurpassed in all the primary
conditions necessary to a great future.
There is no other place in the world. I be
lieve, where people can buy what is needed
for comfortable living so cheaply as they
can here. lv her aericultural develop
ment the people of the State seem to be
doing very well, and if they continue, as 1
hope they will, the best possible will be
rpached. But there is still much to be
desired in tne direction of manufacture.
"The imports of California are much
greater than her exports, and while the
latter are of raw products, what comes to
us from outside the State consists largely
of manufactured goods. This is not as it
should be, and I would like to see Cali
fornia take her rightful place among the
States as a great manufacturing center, in
stead of accepting a t i t tie for her raw mate
rial and paying the other nine-tenths to
have it fashioned by her more skillful sis
ters into shapes and forms for the use of her
people. California needs a more varied
distribution of labor, a distribution
which shall weave the interests of her
people together and make them more de
pendent on each other's skill and handi
work, rather than on the labor of those
outride her borders.
"People are never at their be9t where
they sell their products raw and buy them
back in manufactured forms. They tell
you thai this cannot be corrected because
labor is too hi^h priced, yet wo do not
utilize the labor ws can Ret. For yean
the fiber of India was taken to Scotland,
there put into woof and in the form of
{train sacks was sent to California by the
million*, when California had the climate
ana the cheap food for the workmen, and
the only thing to make the manulacture
impracticable here was the price of labor.
If we could have had tke cheap labor of
Eastern Asia with which to do a portion of
the work tne industries created would have
given employment and support to two
Americans for ev?ry Mongolian, but ihe
Americans lost the work for the lack of
the industries which would spring up in
the development of the raw material.
This could only be done by workmen
whose average price was not much above
the rate paid by other manufacturing
countries of the world. The State must
have more industries if she is ever to be
great and prosperous â for I know of no
people who sell their raw material and
buy their manufactuied goods who ever
attained success â and the only way to
have more industries is to have Jnbor at a
price which will permit of its utilization.
"No Intelligent man questions the gen
eral benefit of our labor-savins machines,
whicn have added 90 immensely to the
prosperity and progress of our country;
yet we might as well rule them out as to
turn away the labor of the Chinese. We
Mave received very Jittle benefits from
Eastern Asia in comparison with what we
ought to have had. The commerce of
China and India have been enriching
Western Europe for many centuries and
Duiling up prcat cities all along tne line of
its march, while the west coast of Amer
ica has turned away this trade from our
doors. Large manufactories could nave
been in existence here to-day if we hail
availed ourselves of the cheap labor which
is at hand, and, as I have said, the in
dustries created by these would have sup
ported a large population of our people.
There are mouths to feed and bodies to
clothe and minds to educate and the in
dustries necessitated by these wants are
many and varied.
"I had the pleasure of beinp oresent at
the anniversary dinner of the Bohemian
Club a fortnight ago, and witnessed there
a scene not only memorable but signifi
cant in San Franc bco. I saw the Chinese
Minister and his suite welcomed with a
heartiness and hospitality wnich did
honor to the good sense and friendly
hearts of those well-known clubmen,
whose reputation for wit, keen Hpprecia
tion of the best things in the intellectual
world, and independence in expressing
their opinions, have made the club fa
mou?. Courteous, Kind and manly were
the words in which the club's presidentâ
who is with us to-nightâ greeted the dis
tinguished envoy from China; and, when
tbe cneers which welcomed Wu Ting Fang
had subsided, the Minister begun nH re
sponse in words which were beautiful to
hear, for they touched the hearts of his
listeners.
" l l hays come,' said he, 'to find an old
friend.' He miaht have added. 1 think,
with truth that he had found many new
ones, and friends, too, wtio would assist
him in righting any wrongs, if wrongs
thoy were, which had been suffered by h'.s
people at the hands of ours; and as he
proceeded with his speech it seemed to me
that China had sent us a representative
who would do honor to his own country
and at the *ame time show us Americans
that all the virtues did not belong to any
one race or creed.
"I hope that the fine spirit of the Bohe
mian Club may find many imitators on
this side ot the continent, as it no doubt
will in the East. China can wait, for she
is a country which counts her age by cen
turies instead of years, and was old wtien
the first Egyptian kings were crowned.
".Perhaps I should apologize lor intrud
ing here a subject which may seem re
moved somewhat from the field in which
our thoughts and allusions would natur
ally gather, but we are to-night a brother
hood, and within that comprehensive
circle one may be permitted to speak for
that part of humanity which in this
country must be more or less defenseless
because it has no vote, and whose offense,
I have sometimes thought, lay in its
ability to .save money where others
waste.
"All these economic questions we,
as officers of the Soutbera Pacific Com
pany, are deeply interested in studying,
for our prosperity runs on parallel lines
with those of the State. California, coni-
Dared with the rest of the United States,
has already more railroad facilities than
her population would warrant. Wo are
prepared to carry a vastly greater ton
nage than we ara likely to get for many
years to come.
"The railroad wants tonnage, for only
by an increase in business can it return
anything to its stockholders ai the present
rates. California, with an area of nearly
4}4 per cent of the entire acreage of the
United State?, has a population of Jess
than 2 per cent. The Slate could easily
support a population of ten million?,
where ;here are now, I Buppose, not over
a million and a half of people. Does
California welcome the coming gnen ex
cept with the personal, social hospitality
for which she is noted? I meet many
Eastern people on their return from a
visit to this State who uniformly
praise, and praise extravagantly, the ser
vice given to the State by the Southern
Pacific Company, declaring that they
have ridden over no finer roads anywhere
and that the charges are lower than they
are on any other important railroad in the
wor!d, considering the conditions which
prevail. I th.nlc we can justly congratu
late ourselves lhat we are doing our part
in the evolution of t:.e State's future, and
I tru-st you mar live to see our glorious
California overflowing with thrifty work
er!* and teeming witn. countless hives of
industry.
"Ouce more, gentlemen, 1 greet you
with all my heart and with the sincere
hope th.it I may often have the pleasure
of again welcoming you under my own
roof."

MARCEAU MUST PAY.
His Ex- Wife Says She Paid 530.000 to
Him to Allow Her a Di
vorce.
Mr*. Gerald M. Fennell, formerly Mrs.
Theodore C. Marceau. testified on the
stand in Justice Barry's court yesterday
that she paid her ex-husband $30,000 to
allow her to regain her freedom through
the courts. She al-o stated that she paid
$10,000 out of her own pocket to satisfy
the claims of the attorneys in the matter.
The case on trial was that of Emily M.
Solly against Theodora C. Marceau and
Mr. and Mr. and Mrs. G. M. Fennell. Mrs.
Solly made some dr?sse? tor Mr?. Fennell
while she was still Mrs. Marceau and the
suit waÂ« brought to determine who was
responsible for the bill, which amounted
to $155. Charles Wesley Reed repre
sented Mrs. Solly, Rogers cfc Patterson the
photoerapher and Attorney McPike Mr.
and Mrs. Fennell.
The main idea of the Fenneiis and Mrs.
Solly seemed to be to fix the responsi
bility on Marceau, and it was shown that
he had sanctioned the purchase and al?o
others in which dresses costing $800 each
fieured.
The efforts were successful, for Justice
Barry decided that Marceau was the per
son who should foot the bill and he en
tered judgment accordingly.
