"I'M NOT DONE,

NEVER LAND ME."
These Were Butler's Last
Words to His Lawyer
on the Mariposa, J
SAILING TO AUSTRALIAN JUSTICE
Butler Says a Fake Newspaper Offered to
. Bribe Him to Sign a Bogus
Confession of Guilt.
**I am not done yet, and they
\- â will never land me."
% The foregoing sentence, pregnant with
| meaning, was the last declaration* of
I Murderer ' Butler, made to his attorney,
|i A. L. Black, just before- the Mariposa
& sailed for Australia last night. What he
% meant, and what success he may yet have
I in his effort to cheat the gallows, ' remain
I to be seen. - His career in .San Francisco

H The processes of remedial justice moved
jf murderer Butler one step nearer to his
? doom yesterday. ;."-.> * ',-r^. \
| Obedient- to the mandates of the.United j
i States Court, and in conformity with inter-
I national treaties, the man suspected of
I many atrocious murders in Australia was
- placed upon the Mariposa and sent to the
Antipodes, where the work of dispatching
|~ murderers is done without delay or ap
peal to Supreme Courts/QSHSfc
The. man against whom mountains of
[ evidence have been secured spent an un- I
\ eventful day up to the appearance of the j
United Stamps Marshals, who took him to j
th*) Mariposa and transferred him to the
custody of Australian officers in . the mid- j
dle of the afternoon. â¢ *â  /.I
I â¢ Butler declined to be interviewed by re-'
porter.-* or others in his cell, spending !
m tof his time wrapped in bis blankets <

To those 'who' have studied , the man \ I
most closely during his incarceration in'
San Francisco there were many evidences
that confinement has weakened him phy
sically and . broken his spirit. He was
pale when : 'the marshal led. him from bis j
cell to .the booking-room cf the jail, and '
'there was an expectant, half-pleading and
. hunted look as he was led down the iron !
stairs to the hack that was to convey him
to the" wharf.
â¢â¢ Only once did Butler glance at any par
ticular person as he was being hurried to
the hack, that being when someone in the
crowd said, "I feel sorry for the poor â¢
â : devil, anyhow." Quick as a flash the mur- |
derer's eyes fell upon the man that made ;
tne remark, and there was something kind
in the glance. For a few minut6B, if never ,
again, the harsh lines made by heredity
and environment were softened, and iT
there was "not something gentle in the
murderer's face it was a look so akin to
gentleness as to deceive those who saw
him at the moment.
Marshal Baldwin and Deputy Gallagher
visited the jail at 3:10 p. m., by which lime
nearly a thousand persons had assembled
in front of the jail to catch a glimpse of
the murderer of the Blue Mountains.
They crowded about the Marshal's hack
and were kept back by a number of police
men, but Butler viewed them with indif
ference, as if he had become accustomed
â¢ to the gaze- of crowds.
â¢"- The marshal and his deputy did not re
main in. the jail to exceed five minutes.
When they entered Butler was lying down,
but rose at once, slipped on a coat and
â¢ .was handcuffed and manacled without
delay... ". .
"How do you feel?" he was asked by
Marshal Baldwin. .. . .
â¢ "Pretty good, thanks," he replied in his
politer';, manner. He was then marched
downstairs without delay and hurried to

the hack, as hundreds of people jostled
and crowded to see him for the last time.
The prisoner would hot see anybody at
the jail yesterday morning, reclining lor
the most of the time and sullenly refusing
to answer questions or show his face to
visitors.
When the Marshal's hack was driven
away toward the whan the crowd fol
lowed for some distance, many taking
cars and hastening to the steamer, hoping
to catch a farewell glance there.
When the hack containing the prisoner
reached the wharf where the Mariposa lay
there were at least a thousand people as
sembled. Some of them bad been in at
tendance since Ba. m. The police were in
force, and when the back appeared the
crowd was driven back, after which Butler
was driven to the steamer's side and the
gates 'to tbe wharf were closed.
As Butler was driven through the
crowd some of the morbid curiosity-seek
ers raised their hats- and a faint cheer
j went up. The Australian detectives took
I it to themselves and one of them waved
[ his disengaged hand through the window
'of the carriage. _ As Butler was manacled
j hand and foot he could not make any
[ acknowledgment," "f"*'"' ""
When tbe gangway of the ship was
reached it did not take long to get the pris
oner out of the hack ariÂ« j aboard the ship.'
He was at once marched to the coll pre-,
pared for him, and when seated Detective
Roche gave him a cigar, which he at once
began to smoke with vigor. Between pulls
be surveyed' bis quarters and seemed sat
isfied until be saw the staple and chain in
j the floor. Tne staple goes throu the
! wood and steel deck of the steamer and is
fastened by a bolt on the under side. It is
strong enough to hold an elephant. The
chain is about a foot long and has a ring
at the end. it looks like the anchor chain
of a small schooner. s '' "
The whole appliance is at' the foot ol
Bu.ler's bed, and the longer he looked at
it the more puzzled be got. Finally he
timed to Detective Roche and asked:
"What is that for?" The officer did not
reply, bnt went out ana got from Chief
Officer Hart another pair of manacles,
.much heavier than the i pair the prisoner
was wearing.. One oi them was carried
through the loop in the chain that is fast
ened to a staple and in a few seconds the
"bracelets'?, were around the accused mur
derer's ankles. Then the small ones were
removed . and Butler was as firmly an
chored as a ship.with her best bowers out
in a good holding ground.
For two hours Butler sat and smoked
and endured the gaze of a constant stream
of people who bad a desire to see "the
man who had outrivaled Durrant," as one
woman put it.
"Come in and see him," said one
stylishly dressed woman.
â¢'Oh, I'm afraid," answered back a frail
young girl, who was her companion.
"Come along, you stupid, don't you see
he's chained up and can't get out?" and
she forced the maiden into the little cabin,
which reeked witb tobacco smoke. She
was not without companions of her own
sex, however, as others had gathered to
see him.
Next came a handsome young woman
with two very prettily dressed children in

tow. The little ones looked fresh and |
sweet. They wore gowns of white.'over
which were scarlet jackets, and the curly
heads were surmounted with dainty sailor
caps.
"Come in ana see the murderer," said
the mother to the children, and the little
ones sobbed "No, no. no!" The mother
tried to force them, but could not, so she
had to be content with satisfying her own
curiosity. _ i
Men and women or all ages crowded one
another to see the man accused of hall a
dozen murders. A policeman and two
deputy marshals could not keep them out,*
and finally Butler turned to Marshal Bald
win and said: "For God's sate, give me a
little breathing space. - I'm no saint,' but
I'm not on exhibition. You're not giving
me fair:. play. * If I have to endure this,
charge them a quarter a head, and I'll 'put â 
up with it if you'll give me the money."
Then. he fell to smoking his cigar again. â¢
In thirty seconds the room was. cleared,
and thirty seconds later the alley on
the lower deck was crowded with people
anxious to get a look at the man whose
supposed crimes have convulsed two con
tinents. Outside on the stringers of the
wharf dozens of women were stand in?
around * and peering 'through " the small
porthole in . a ... vain endeavor to get a
glimpse of the prisoner. .When darkness
fell on the scene they gradually dispersed,
but the privileged few hung around until
the last minute.
Butler talked freely. while awaiting the
departure of the. steamer. "1 have been
all over Oceanica," said be, "and have
been in many tight places, but this is the
tiehtest yet.' 1 was once a sailor on the
schooner Tubal Cain, trading from a New
Zealand port to Fiji, and we were wrecked
on a coral reef. "After the storm those of
us that were left, had to stand up to our
waists in water before the natives came
along and took ,ns off. 1 was a prisoner
of the natives of New Guinea, came within
an ace of 1 marrying a princess;' in Tonea
tabo, had to drink kava with Damaseese
in Samoa until my lower limbs were par
alyzed ;â¢ was : again wrecked off the coast
oi New. Zealand, and I then went back to
Australia. * There I started in as a pros
pector, and the rest you know. Now lam
on my way back to Sydney, charged with
every crime in the calendar.
"I admit that I am afraid of the forgery
charge that is pending .against me and "
At this point Detective McHattie began
paying particular attention to the conver
sation * and Butler shut up like a clam.
Not another. world could .: be got out rof
him, except that he wished the detectives
would take the cuffs off his .wrists, as the
constrained position in which be was
placed made his shoulders ache.
The ; Australian detectives got a great
scare when the news was 'quietly, given
them that opium had been smuggled
| aboard;. for Sutler's use in case; of an
; emergency. They at once communicated
j with Captain Lees, and Detectives' Kgan
! and Silvey were soon at the scene. . A
quiet but systematic search of the vessel
| .was made and * every cabin-boy's effects
I were searched. The firemen, coal passers, ,
j oilers and deckhands also bad their effects
loosed over and all underwent a rigid ex
| amination. No opium was found. -
| Not even an innocent. cigar offered by a
reporter to the prisoner '.was .Butler j
allowed to receive. * *
During the entire voyage Butler will get
his cigars and tobacco from Roche, and
his meals will be taken, to him from the
same dishes that are furnished to the
three detectives. One 'of 'them -'will be
. with v him night and day,* nnd once "in
every twenty-four hours he will be given
a breathing spell on deck with two officers
in attendance. Wiih all thiÃ care -'and
vigilance the chances are altogether
against tiller taking his own life let alone
escaping at any of tho way ports. ** â '-*â  â 'â '
Among those who went out on the
steamer, which, left her.dock.at 0,:30. p. m.,
with the detectives were United Stales
District Attorney Foot* and United States
Marshal Baldwin. Off Meiggs wharf the
prisoner was transferred to the Australian
- detectives, and Marshal Baldwin and his
friends came ashore. - . 7 {
Shortly after the vessel left her moor

mitment â  signed rby , Jonn " Sherman, Sec

Marshal Baldwin at once in a tew for
mal words delivered his prisoner into the

latter a receipt for Butler. Both of these
interesting documents appear in full in
another column. i .â '';.â - / / \\
The "reason for > not transferring the
prisoner to .the Australian oflicers until

of habeas corpus. So long as the prisoner

no writ issued by a State court would hold;
and no Federal court would, under the
circumstances, cause such a writ to issue - .
A State-courtw rit would have been effec

DICK MURPHY'S
QUEER PARTNER
How the Sporting Saloon
man Lost His Sack
of Twenties.
Seen Home by a False Friend,
Who Robbed Him of
. His God.
Officer Ryan Is Anxious to Make the
Acquaintance ol Murphy's.
Friead.
Richard Murphy, better known by his
associate-* as "Dick," the sporting partner
of Patrick Prunty, who conducts a saloon
at lil Third street, has taken a solemn
vow that hereafter he will be more careful
in selecting a bed-fellow from among his
associates in the south of Market-street
section.
This vow, as made by Sporting "Dick,"
has a cause the nature of which Murphy
doe not care to discuss in public. Suffice
it; however; to narrate that the half
. owner in the saloon on Third street is a
spprt with a keen relish for staking his
money on the long shots at Ingleside and
eisewhere, when there are genuine bloods
. to be found with plenty of money to burn.
Last week was one of "Lucky Dicks
fortunate periods. He attended the race
course during the week and wound up by
-taking in the coursing match on Sunday,
and as a result had $400 in twenties in a
little canvas sack in the back pocket of
his Sunday trousers. With this amount
clear of the proceeds of what might be
his share of the profits of the saloon,
Murphy started out on his return from
the coursing match, to paint a section of
Third and Howard streets a bright ver
milion hue. How well he succeeded is
only known to himself and such of his
associates as he met and disposed of with
a treacherous memory of passing events.
.The last place where liquid refre-h
--ments were served across a pine plank by
a smiling ; roprietor was at Patrick .'.
Horan's resort at 733 Howard street at the
early hour of 4 o'clock on Monday morn
ing. Here sporting "Dick" made the ac
quaintance of some ladies who accident
ally dropped in to see bow the land lay.
After bidding the ladies a pleasant
good-by a nice, smooth young man in
stantly formed an attachment for "Dick,"
arid, i: is needless to add. his friendship
was reciprocated by Mr. Murphy, who, at
this time, was full of good wishes for
everybody in general so long as i: is good
-nature was not aggravated into combat.
The nice young man stuck to his friend
with the tenacity of a horse-leech, and in
proof of his friendship volunteered to see
"Dick" to bis home, at 521 Bryant street.
How they got there is not on record, but
there they got all th* same, as "Dick"
now recollects. The nice young man put
his friend to bed, taking care to undress
him according to the rules of good society.
In order that nothing of a serious nature
should befall Mr. Murphy, his new-found
campanion went to bed alongside of him
and saw that his sleep was not disturbe I
until the sun had passed the meridian
line. :'. ' .â ' ' , '
"In the meantime the nice young man
left his friend's company and by way of
carrying off a little souvenir as a memento
of the acquaintanceship be took snorting
"Dick's" gold watch and chain and a box
containing jewelry which he found on the
bureau.
It is hardly necessary to add that the
little-canvas tack containing $400 was not
overlooked. This of course the young
man took for safekeeping, a condition he
has faitbiully lived un to, as he has not
b-en seen round Third or Howard
streets since. Officer Ryan, to whom
"Dick's" loÂ«s had been reported, is
anxiously looking for him.
Out of ail tnis sadness experienced by
"Dick" and his friends there is oue per
son clng. and this is Mrs. Fitzgerald,
with whom Murphy lodges. Her joy is
over the fact that none of her property
was taken by the nice young man. Had
. he known, however, that the lady was
absent and that there was no one in the
house at 521 Bryant street but himself and
his sleeping friend she might have an
. other tale to tell, as she had considerable
jewelry in her room tbat. could have been
taken as was "Dick's" without any diffi
culty.
Murphy is not quite sure whether he
could identify his new friend or not, as
, his memory was a little murky when he
met him. But his watch and chain he
can identify, as his name is engraved on
the inside case of the watch. He claims

that the timepiece was a superior article,
and one that he would not part with for
$150. . â¢
Since the little epoch of Sunday night
has occurred none of his friends care to
a k him any questions about his new
triend. He still attends the races in
search of long shots but not new ac
quaintances^ - * -

The last maitnee concert given by
Camilla Urso filled Golden. Gate Hall yes
terday afternoon with a deligh.ed audi
ence. The programme was lengthened by
more than* its original composition
through the insistent encores, which all

Because of the sudden illness of Mr.
Douglas, his ace was taken on the biil
by the Colonial Quartet, which made the
hit to which it has -become familiar.
Mme. Urso had three numbers on the
bill â suite for violin by Rust, andante
cantabile, Ssambati, and an etude by*

sition filed herein by Asa W. Wits, to the pro
bating of the proposed will of said deceased
be and the same is hereby dismissed without
prejudice to any application for the revoca
tion of letters testamentary, should such let
ters be issued upon the probate of the pro
posed will to any one. Joseph McKinley,
Attorney lor Contestant.
A. Everett Ball, of Counsel.
Date-! March 29, 1897.
Mr. Estee, in an interview, said tbat the
dismissal of the contest- was entirely vol
untary on the part of the contestant;
that there was no compromise and that
none had been suggested ; that nothing
bad been paid and that not so much as a j
10-cent piece nad been offered by the pro- j
ponents of the will. He .did not know j
what the future course of A. W. Fisk ;
would be. In accordance with his notice i
of dismissal be had not sacrificed or lost {
any of bis rights, but could legally resume
his antagonism to the will at anytime
within a year if so disposed.
Mr. Titus added that the suit in the
United States District Court is still pend- j
ing, involving substantially the same in- |
terests. No notice of abandonment in j
that matter had been received by Mrs.
Fisk and her children.
At the opening of Judge Coffey's court
Mr. Estee presented the written dismissal, '
but he in turn was given a surprise, for'
Judge Coffey produced a : tele gram dated f
nt Yreka, Cai., April 1, and signed by Mr. j
Ball, asking that a continuance be granted
I in the demurrer to the contest for the rea
son that he (Mr. Ball) was unavoidably
! detained.
Mr. Estee said he did not know any
j thing about the differences between Mr.
McKinley and Mr. Ball; that lie notice of j
dismissal of contest had not been served
M him or his associates in the case. The j
notice of dismissal was filed with the
clerk of the court, and that was the only I
; information he possessed. J â :'.- ;*""Â«
It was finally agreed that the proving |
of the will should be proceeded with and
Mrs. Fisk and her son and dauchter were
called as witnes-es. They agreed that the !
estate cousins of $100,000 worth of real j
property- and about $250,000 in money,
stocks, bonds and other personal effects.
Subscribing witnesses to the execution
of the will were then introduced and testi- â 
fied that the testator was of sound mind >
/ when the instrument was executed.
In accordance with tn s showing the i
will was admitted to probate and letters j
I testamentary were ordered to issue to ]
Mrs. Fisk and Arthur G. Fisk, as required !

Time.

fcp;-';.
A deliberate attempt was made early
yesterday morning to destroy by fire the
building at 131 Taylor street, and its con
tents.
Tbe building is a three-story frame, and
the two upper stories are occupied by Mrs.
Katie Malcomson as a lodging-house. At
4:45 o'clock yesterday morning, an alarm
was turned in from box 95. for a fire in
the building, and after it had been extin
guished Captain Comstock reported to
Scene of the Attempt to Burn the House at J3l Taylor Street.
Fire Marshal Towe that there was evi
dence to show tbat it was a case of incen
diarism.
The only occupants of the lodging-house '
at the time of the tire were Mrs. Malcom
son, who slept on a lounge in the kitchen,
and Mr. and Mrs. Brown, who slept in
the back parlor of the first floor.
Tbe Fire Marshal, after making an ex
amination, found that a Are had been
started in the front parlor on the first floor,
which was unoccupied. Upstairs be found
that fires had^also been started in the two
rear rooms, both unoccupied. The con
tents of these three rooms were completely
destroyed.
Three fires being started at the same
time in different room* was suspicions
enough, but on going into tbe two front
rooms on the top floor ail doubt was set
at rest. The mattresses and lounges bad
been ripped open and the excelsior pulled
out and spread around so as to burn more
quickly.- - :'-'â ,- -:;v.~ *-.--'*.,.
- Mrs. Malcomson on being questioned
said she knew nothing about the fire till a
man rusbe i in from the street and told
her. She suspected a - girl who . need to
room there, but who had left Friday
night and taken' all her personal effects
away.
With the assistance of Detective An
thony the Fire Marshal found the girl,
and after talking with her he tea* satis
fied she bad . nothing to do with the tire,
not even knowing that it had occurred.
Brown and his wife were also ques
tioned, but they said they knew nothing
about the matter until they were awakened
from their sleep by the alarm. They bad
a narrow escape from being burned to
death.
Further inquiries by tbe . Fire Marshal
glinted the information that the contents
of the lodging-house were insured for
$1000, which was far in excess of their
value, and that Mrs. Malcomson had been
I trying to sell out for $600.
Mrs. Malcomson is a woman about 40
years of age. She says she entered into a
contract marriage with a man in New
York several years ago, but she does not
know whether he is alive or dead. She
has been in the habit of playing the races,
with indifferent success.
- The loss on the building is estimated at
$300 and on contents $200.
"I am satisfied," said the Fire Marshal
last night, "as to who set the place on
fire,' but I am not yet in â¢ position to make
any arrests." â  .
Charged With Burglary.
James Fennessy, a painter, was arrested last
night by Detectives E .an and Silver and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
burglary. On March 26 he broke into the
paint shop at 308 Sutler street and stole a
number ot brushes.
Larcelere's Cashier.
G. McGregor Deacon, the defaulting cashier
of I. R. Larzelere & Co., merchants, Davis
street, was booked- at the City Prison last
night on four charges of felony embezzlement
and was released on $0000 bonds. Deacon
was arrested ln Vancouver, B. C. and brought
to the City. Tne case was taken into the
Police Court, but the matter was afterward
laid before the Grand Jury and four indict
ments were lound against Deacon and war
rants issued from the Superior Court for his
arrest. .-.â¢â

bards Cretan Christians.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â Rather
more than the usual number of Repre
sentatives were in their seats to-day when
the House reassembled after its three-day
recess.
J. Hamilton Lewis (Fusion) of Wash
ington appeared and was sworn in.
After Terry (D.) of Arkansas had made
a lengthy personal statement in regard to
certain proceedings in the course of tbe
â¢tariff debate last Tuesday, Dingley moved
and it was agreed to that when the House
adjourn it should be until Wednesday
next. 7-
A message was received from the Senate
transmitting the joint resolution author
izing tbe Secretary of the Navy to trans
port in suitable American vessels, which
he shall charter, contributions cf the peo
pie of the United States to the famine
stricken of India.
At the request of Grout (R.) of Ver
mont it was taken from the Speaker's
table for immediate consideration.
The matter o the cost of tbe proposed
transportation came up. but it could not
be answered because no estimate had
been received.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois stated that he
believed that the cost would not exceed
$50,000, but If it should run up to $70,000
he thought the House should pass the
resolution. [Applause.]
McMillm (1).) of Tennessee called at
tention to the spectacle thai would be pre
sented by the passage of tbe resolution
tbe Unite i States contributing* to the
starving English subjects in one part of
tbe wond, while sbe was bombaiding suf
fering Christians in another part of the
world. [Applause.] He asked tbat the
resolution. be allowed to go over until
Wednesday.
. McMillin, responding to Dockery. said
if he could he would add to the resolution
a section condemning the policy of Great
Britain in the Cretan question.^3__c|gÃjÃ
7 Cannon deprecated the throwing of
stones in connection with the performing
of a gracious act of charity. "If it ever
comes to a question of policy," he con
tinned, "between the United States and
Great Britain in which the honor and
safety of this country is involved, I will
join the gentleman from Tennessee or
any one else in throwing stones where it
means something."
Groat set before the - House the state
ments of the Viceroy of India and the ne
cessity for the prompt relief of the people
of that country, saying. tbat unless condi
tions th re were cb.ani.ed deaths would be
numbered by tbe hundreds of thousands,
if not millions. Tbe contributions in this
relief, he stated, were large, already one
shipload having been dispatched on pri
vate account. *â¢ , . i
Simpson said we out-h t . to accompany
our charity with a statement of the evi
dence which had brought these people to
starvation.; It was, he said, the effects of
the absent landlordism, which had re
duced the people of Ireland and other
parts of the British kingdom to their con
dition. ThÂ« r< solution. was passed.
At 12:15 the Housa adjourned to
Wednesday next.
ARMY STREET NEXT.
Precita Valley Residents Demand Side-
walks in Their Section.
The people residing in Precita Valley,
which at one time was an overflowed
swamp from ths Mission Creek.but now
Butler Chained to His Bed on the
Mariposa.
a cozy and prosperous section of the City,
have made their wants. known through
the influence of an improvement club.
. This club, bacKed by the property-own
ers, has done some valuable service in hav
ing streets filled in, sewers put down and
a few electric lights scattered where they
will do the most good.
But this is not all that the club and the
people require to make them happy and
content. They want Army street:; side
walked from Nebraska to De Haro.
The necessity fur this modern- improve
ment is felt by the large number of . work
men who are employed in 7 the various
factories alon the San Bruno road, in the
Potrero and South San Francisco, Army
street being the only avenue leading from
the extreme southwestern end of the Mis
sion to the Potrero and Bntcbertown.
To those tramping on the center of a
roadway that is being -badly cut up with
teams in the winter time, becoming a bed
of slush, and in the summer a coating of
suffocating dust, is not a_reeable. Hence 1
the Supervisors will be petitioned to place
sidewalks over that portion mentioned.
: To represent this, with other needs, to
tbe City Fathers a' delegation consisting
of George Green, Thomas Foley and Henry
Peterson was appointed by the Pr cita
Vaney Improvement Club at its meeting
on last Friday night. , 7 .
DENIES MISMANAGEMENT.
The North Pacific CoÂ»Â«t Railroad Com
pany Answers J. S. McCue'S
, . Complaint.'
--; The North Pacific Coast Railroad Com
pany has 'entered . a demurrer before the
Board of Railroad Commissioners answer
ing the complaint . of J. S..McCuo. . Most
of the complaints are denied ai\d the* rest
asserted to be legal.
It denies tbat by mismanagement of its
business it has injured its own interest or
that of any citizen of Marin County, As
1 the terminal station of its own line and <
that of the San Francisco and North Pa
cific Railway are in different parts of San
Rafae!, . and as j most of it? patrons are
alleged to be in the thickly settled region
between that city and Sausalito, it states
that it merely consults the convenience of
the passengers in having its time-table ar
ranged as it 7* ':,;'â "â¢ \.
7 As regard -7 lowering rates, beginning
April 1, 1579, and continuing for a. few
months, it is alleged to have been done as
an experiment ; and while there was no
competing line. The lowered rate was
discontinued because it was found to be
unprofitable ana for no other renson.7
; A denial is made that the coniDany has
ever sold round trip tickets to San Rafael
to the members of the Schuetzen Club or
any other persons for 25 cents each.
Schedules of its own- and the rates of
other suburban lines, in connection with
the comparative number of passengers
carried in a -given' time, are submitted;
which are asserted to show that the de
femiant's charges to passengers are fair.
\ Denial is also made that the difference
in price of monthly commutation-t ickets
sold by it to men from the price of similar
tickets sold to women constitutes an un
lawful or improper discrimination or any
actual discrimination whatever.
For these reasons it is asked that tbe
complaint be dismisse l.

- Annual Eight-Oar Race Be
tween Crews of the
Universities.
Cambridge Makes a Gallant
Struggle, but Is Clearly
i â .'.'â ' Outrowed. â¢
NeVer Has There Been Such a Large
Crowd of Spectators on the Banks
of the Thames.
â¢LONDON, Esq., April The annual
. eight-oar race between the crews of the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge was
rowed to-day. over the Thames champion
ship course of four and a quarter miles,
from Putney to Mortlake, and was won
by Oxford by three lengths.
Tbe weather was raw and damp and the
wind blew in gusts throughout the fore
noon, but the usual crowds began mov
ing'toward'Putney at an early hoar, most
. of them wearing light or blue colors, and
the countless cabmen had colors of their
favorites tied to their coats. Special trains,
which were- 'ran at frequent intervals,
were packed with people, though many of
those wentto Sydenham, where the cham
pionship jjame of football between Eng
land and Scotland was to be played.
At noon there was a strong wind from
the east, veering slightly to the south,
which promised a fast race. The Oxford
, men came out in their -working boat and
paddled about for a few minutes. They
then spurted for a mile and a half at a
fast stroke, after which they returned to
theif quarters.
The weather was bitterly cold, but the
* water was smooth. It was evident from
the size of the crowd that occupied every
available space along the banks of the
Thames .at Putney and throughout the
course that the feature was as popular an
even: this year as it has always been
hitherto. Besides attracting a great throng
of amateurs, the race as usual drew to the
. banks of the* Thames thousands of cock
neys, to whom in spite of their ignorance
- of aquatics,, it was one of the great events
of the year, and to witness which they
'. brave the worst kind of . weather, and to
these must be added all the friends of the
..oarsmen forming the university crews of
this and many previous years.
The stone bridge which leads to the
high - road.- across the river at Putney,
â  close to the point from which the boats
.'started, was thronged with people, and
tbe wide stretch of shore just below on the
.-right bank, in front of the boathouses of
-. tne London, Leander and other rowing
clubs, was no less densely packed with
."spectators, this being the place at which
the boats were launched. Equally great
- '.were the crowds of holiday-makers on all
.part's of the towpath along the riverside
:--. and upon Hammersmith bridge, beneath
.which tbe. boats passed on their course to
''â¢;tiie H winning-post, and Barnes railway
.- bridge had .a smaller, but not less enthu
siastic patronage. Great numbers of
.coaches and other vehicles were drawn
" ' up wherever roads or waste ground gave
access to the banks, and all these had
full loads of excited and cheering specta
'. tor's. So had innumerable barges, tugs,
â rafts- and other floating things moored
- . along the banks at various points.
Shortly before the race was started all
traffic on the waterway was stopped by
the officials of the Thames Conservancy
as completely as is the traffic of the streets
upon the occasion of a royal procession.
Barges were towed out into the stream
.. and swung across to block the arched wav
under Putney bridge, and in front of this
barrier the four â ordinary
paddle-wheel passenger- boats which con
veyed the persons privileged to follow the
racers took 'up their appointed places.
These clumsy craft were allotted respec
tively to guests of the empire, guests of
. the Oxford University Boat Club, guests
of the Cambridge University Club and
* representatives of the press.
A quick movement in front of the boat
house and a double chorus of ' ''Stand
* back, please," from the police, and "Here
they come," from the people,' at length
announced the Heroes of the hour. The
Cambridge men as nominal challengers
were the first in leaving their headquarters
amid the cheers of their supporters. They
carried a beautiful new clasper boat to the
landing stage and were soon afloat pad
dling with slow precision to a skiff
moored for them in th; stream, and tak
ing their place there to await the arrival
- of their opponents, apparently oblivious
* of the-rouhds of applause which greeted
them on every sid->.
Again the movement on shore, and the
Oxford crew emerged from their head
quarters and raised their dark blue blades
over the beads of the crowds. As they
carried their boat to the water they were
'greeted with an outburst of enthusiasm
* exceeding in volume and fervor that ac
* corded to the light blues, for to the greet
ings of genuine Oxonian partisans was
â added that miscellaneous sympathy
* â¢ which stems invaiiably to attach itself to
* prospective as well as actual victors in
any contest. They were soon launched,
- and paddled out amid continuous cheers
* lo their own moored skiff. -
All preparations having been completed,
the umpire, Frank Willan, on board a lit
- tle steam launch, put to the crews the cus
â¢ tomary question, % "Are you 7 ready?" and
almost instantly afterward gave the signal
to start, by firing his pistol. The oars of both
crews fell almost simultaneously- into the
* water and the boats shot forward on their
* course^ At a prescribed interval tbe four
paddle-wheel steamers followed the racers,
their occupants, with the exception of the
<t busy reporters on the press boat, roaring
encouragement to their respective fa
vorites. . # .-..:â¢ f. i i p
The boat* got off at 2:24 o'clock exactly.
At tbe London Rowing Club's boathouse
Oxford was -a few feet ahead, but upon
reaching . .Bishop's 'â ] Creek Cambridge
.spurted and drew up level with the Ox
onians .and were rowing well. * It was an
exceptionally good race to Craven cottage,
. a little short of a mile : from the start,
Cambridge sticking close to the Oxford
boat, but. at Hammersmith bridge Ox
ford had drawn away, and was - about a
length ahead. Both crews were fresh and
rowing steadily. Oxford, however, > in
creased their lead and at . Chiswick : Eyot,
about two and quarters miles from
the start, had drawn ahead' a length and
a half. At Bull's Head Oxford seemed to
be leading by two lengths, and as , the
boats passed under Barnes Railway bridge
it.was seen that the dark blues were" fully
*jWO lengths ahead and racing splendidly.
As seen from the press boat Cambridge
made* a fine spurt at Bishop's 'Creek,
which was answered *by Oxford, whose
men seemed perfectly fresh. It was a
good race to and from some distance from
this : point, in fact,' from start to finish.
| Oxford shot by Hammersmith bridge
nearly a length ahead of Cambridge.
Cambridge put on a spurt and reduced the
lead, but the efforts of the light blues
died away and Oxford gradually increased
their lead to : the end, .having virtually
won the race after passing Chiswick Eyot.
Oxford's time was 19 minutes and 4
seconds. Her time in last year's race,
which the Oxford boat won by two-fifths
of a length, was 20 minutes and 2 seconds.
There was an American in each boat.
De Knopp of New College, Oxford,
bow for his university. He is a - resident
of Albany. B. H. Howell. No. 4 in the
Cambridge boat, lives in New York City.
Oxford's time officially announced was
19 mm. 11 4-5 sec. - The same authority
says that Oxford won by two and two
thirds lengths.
The Globe and the Pall Mall Gazette
agree in the statement that the Oxford
boat passed Barnes bridge three lengths
ahead and that the race was then virtually
over, although Fernie, the Cambridge
stroke, did not relax his efforts to spur his
men on to possible victory. The betting
just before the start was 1 to 4 Oxford,
with few takers. Cambridge won the toss
and had tbe -Middlesex side of the river,

tf
Other Plots to Commit Assassination
Are Charged Up to the Desper
ate Female.
CHICAGO, 111., April 3.â After more
than four years and a naif have elapsed
Ernestine Dunkey, alias Warnicke, alias
Abraham, is under arrest in the suburban
village of Melrose Park charged with the
brutal murder of Ernest Kuenetb, an aged
and rich farmer of that place.
*On the morning of October 27, 1892,
Kueneth was found huddled in a chair
before his fire, dead and mangled, a great
slash across his skull and a terrible wound
on his temple. A blood-stained corn
knife and stove-poker lay near by.'. The
crime remained a mystery until recently.
Herman Dunkey, who lived on Fisk
street, this city, quarreled with his wife
and told a friend with whom he worked
a circumstantial story which pointed to
his wife, the prisoner, as the murderess.
The police were informed and her arrest
followed. Dunkey betrayed the woman
after be had discovered that she was not
his legal wife and when she deserted him.
He also accuses the woman of wanting
him to insure the lives of his children by
a former wife and offering to kill them
and of asking an elder son to push his
father into the lake when fishing.
Dunkey stated to the Justice of the
Peace to-day at the preliminary hearing
that the woman returned to their home
the day after the murder with disheveled
and matted hair, which proved to be
stained with blood, with blood on ber
dress, her face bruised and scratched and
marks of fin.ers on her chin and throat.
She said she bad a terrible fight with a
man and burned her clothing on a stove.
,He said that she confessed that her vic
tim bad only $150, and that she killed
him because he proposed marriage to her
and broke bis word, although mentioning
no names, and Dunkey said be never
thought of connecting her with Kueneth's
murder. Nc Marsen, who is now under
sentence of death here for the murder of
Fritz Hotzueter, was suspected of Kue
neth's murder, because he left the village
hurriedly after the tragedy. The woman
declares her innocence.

LONDON, Eng., April 3.â The Evening

room the other night, made a disparaging
remark concerning the mother of a fel
low-member, Mr. Gerard O'Shea, who is
the son of Captain O'Shea and Mrs.
O'Shea Parnell. Young O'Shea, who was
present, resented the remark as grossly
insulting and threw the contents of his
glass into Mackie's face.
Further hostilities were prevented by
the other clubmen in the room, but even
tually O'Shea met Mackie after be bad
gone downstairs, preparatory to leaving
the building,- and struck him a heavy
blow on the jaw, knocking him down.
In falling Mackie's head struck against a
fender, rendering him unconscious.
Mackie was picked up and removed to a
bed in tbe club, where after remaining
some time, not regaining consciousness, a
doctor was called to him. The physician

ists in London, together with a number
of trained . nurses, were summoned and
have since been in attendance upon him.
He is now suffering from the effects of
concussion of the brain, but it is hoped by

POWERS PROTECT
BASHI BAZOUKS
Permit Treacherous Turks
" to Attack Insurgents
While Moving.
Permission Had Been Given the
Christians to Leave
Akrotiri.
Strange and Heartless Tactics of the
,-.â¢.'; Admirals Who Are Befriending
Moslems.
CANEA, Cbeti, April 3.â insurgents
in the hills about the town of Akrotiri on
the peninsula of that name recently asked
the foreign admirals for permission to
leave their positions, as they desired to
leave the peninsula. The authorization
â¢ was granted, and to-day the insurgents,
with their families, descended from the
hills, driving their cattle before them and
not. suspecting any danger. .
They had scarcely reached .the lower
ground when -7000 Bashi Bazouks sud
denly fired upon them at a range of only
220 yards. The Bashi Bazouks had
emerged from Canea last evening and
made their way to the neighborhood of
the insurgent position, having apparently
received information that the Christians
were about to evacuate the peninsula.
The Turkish force consisted mainly of
refugees who had been brought to Canea
from Selino by Sir Alfred Biliotti, the
â¢ British Consul here.
At'tei; their arrival in Canea they had
been armed by the Governor in defiance
of the promises that had been made to
the admirals. Their arms had been taken
. from them when they were compelled to
evacuate Selino, but they experienced not
the slightest difficulty in procuring other
weapons by direction of the Governor.
' The insurgents were armed, and they
soon recovered from the surprise occa
sioned by the sudden attack of the Bashi
Bazouks. They then returned the fire,
whereupon the latter returned to Canea.
As they approached the town they
quietly deposited their arms and ammuni
tion in places where they would not be
seen by the foreigners here. Part of the
weapons were placed in houses on the out
skirts, while the remainder were deposited
in the Majendies barracks.
The international forces ashore did not
take any measures to prevent the collision
and the warships in Suda Bay did not fire
a shot to check the Bashi Bazouks.
â¢ The Mussulmans lost heavily in the en
gagements. Fifty dead and wounded
. were brought to Canea. Some of the Mos
lems, presumably not refugees, attempted
to bring their arms into town, but they
were stopped at the gates or fortified lines

officers of the gendarmerie.
The Mussulmans are very much in
censed by this action and are assembling
in great numbers at Spiazzia.
It is stated this evening that British

PARIS, Fbakcb, April 3.â ln the Cham
ber of Deputies to-day M. Gautier de Clag
ney interpellated the Government regard
ing the Cretan situation.
M. Hanotaux, the Minister of Foreign
â¢ Affairs, replying to the interpellation, de
clared that it was impossible to reproach
the Government for the action they had
taken in the matter. He added that it
was not likely that a conflict would occur
at present on the Macedonia frontier. The
powers were considering the question of
eventually blockading the ports of Greece.
Continuing, M. Hanotaux stated that
. there was nothing specially disquieting in
, the situation. It was hoped that councils
of- wisdom would prevail with time.
,M. Cochin asked the Government for in
formation regarding the massacres at
Sivas and Tokat in Anatolia, where a
number of Armenians were killed by
Turks and Kurds. He also desired to
. know why coercion had not been applied
to the Sultan to compel him to obey the
demands of the powers.
M. Hanotaux replied that a message had
been telegraphed on March 16 to M. Cam
bon, the French Embassador at Constan
tinople, directing him to make representa
tion to the Sultan as to the unsatisfactory
state of affairs. M. Hanotaux further said
' that in consequence of wrongful acts tbe
. Military Governor of Adana had been re
called by the Porte and a Christian ap
pointed in his stead.
With reference to the application of co
ercion M. Hanotaux said the powers had
decided to exact the execution of the re
forms that had been demanded and which
had been promised by the Sultan. Europe,
he said in conclusion, might count upon
the firmness of the Embassadors at Con
stantinople insisting upon the execution
ef reforms.
t " LONDON, Eno., April 3.â Several of the
correspondents of London newspapers
telegrapuing from Canea represent that
the foreign admirals were seriously !
blamable for.the fighting that occurred '>
between the insurgents and Turkish ir
â¢ regular troops in the peninsula of Akro
-1 tiri.
They state that Admiral Canevaro, the
Italian naval officer who is in command
7 of the combined fleets of the powers, had
given his assent to the request of the in
surgents that they be allowed to leave the
peninsula ana pass through Canea to the
interior of the island.
They evidently trusted that the admiral
would give them safe passage, but it seems
that no measures were taken to protect
them. ~-p..,: .
When the admirals learned that the
â¢ Bashl-bazouks were barring the way of the
Christians they ordered that detachments
of sailors and marines be sent to disarm
them and compel them to return to Canea,
. but It was then too late for the detach
ments to carry out their orders. It does
net appear why the foreign warships did
*â¢ net shell the bashi bazouks.

JULIO SAHGOILLS'S PLEDGE.
It Would Prevent This Country . Trotn
Saving Him Again. . '.'â ,â ?.Â»
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.âSec
retary Sherman made a statement to-day
of importance to Americans . who are
active in Cuban matters. When asked
about the reported intention of Julio San-
KUilly, who arrived at Jacksonville, Fla.,
with aids to go to Cuba, he replied :
"I don't believe he will go. If he should
be so foolish he will have to take bis life
into his own hands. We should never in
terfere in his behalf again, Dut would have
to let things take their course. 1 have his
written pledge not to take an active part
in the insurrection in any way. So has
Spain, and they could kill him without
ceremony. No, I think he would not be
such a fool." C;. frW
The pledge referred to was made by San
guilly in January just ..before bis pardon
by the Queen Regent of Spain and was
signed voluntarily in Spanish and Eng
lish and handed to Consul-General Lee.
The Spanish copy went to the Spanish
authorities and the one in English is now
on Secretary Sherman's desk. It reads:
I, Julio Sanguilly, an American citizen con
fined at Cabanas Fortress, Havana, do hereby
sacredly affirm to the United States and to
Spain that if I am released by pardon of the
latter Government 1 will leave and remain
away from Cuba, and will not aid directly or
indirectly the present insurrection against the
government of Spain, and I hereby promise
that should I do so at lime I will not claim
the protection of the United States Govern
ment. I certify that this pledge ls given of
my own free will and without compulsion on
the part of any one. Julio Sanguilly.
Witnesses: Ernesto Fouseca, Donnel Rock
well.
Fortress Cabana, Havana, January 21, 1897.
If Sanguilly makes any attempt to carry
out his reported intention of leaving for
Cuba the United States will be powerless
to stop bim unless he goes with an armed
expedition, but grave fears are expressed
at the State Department that the depar
ture of Sanguilly at this time might seal
the fate of other Americans imprisoned in
Cuba where pardon by the Queen Regent
under similar conditions is now being
sought

BIG FIUE AT CHATTANOOGA.
Lives Lost in the Flames and Property
Worth Half a Million Dollars
Destroyed,
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 3.â A special
to the Scripps-McÃae Press from Chatta
nooga gives an account of a disastrous fire
that occurred in that city at an early hour
this morning, when the Richardson build
ing, the largest building in the city, was
totally destroyed.
The fire was discovered by the watch
man, who tried to put it out without help,
but it proved to be beyond him and he
turned in an alarm. The delay, however,
proved to be disastrous, for the flames
spread rapidly, and by the time the Fire
Department had arrived the building was
doomed.
A gallant but unsuccessful fight was
made, but the flames steadily advanced
until the whole building was gutted.
For a while it seemed as if the fire
would spread to the adjoining buildings,
and after it was seen that the Richardson
block was doomed the firemen devoted all
their energies to keeping the fire in the
building in which it started. -In this tbey
were not wholly successful. Some of the
neighboring structures were , badly
scorched, and the small building adjoin
ing was destroyed.
A number of persons were asleep in the
building when the fire broke out. The
delay of the watchman, which gave the
fire great headway, proved fatal to two of
the lodgers and all the others had narrow
escapes. S. M. Patton, a wealthy and
prominent architect of the city, was
burned to death in his bed.
Tho most thrilling incident during the
fire was the attempted escape and death
of Boyd Ewing, one of the wealthiest
citizens of Chattanooga. After the flames
had spread so as to prevent escape by the
stairways two men appeared at one of the
windows of the sixth story. They were
recognized as Boyd 'Fwing and Richard
son, the owners of the building.
The only hope of escape the men had
was to reach the fire-escape near the win
dow. Ewing climbed out first, and,
helped by Richardson, had almost reached
safety, when he slipped and fell. For an
instant Richardson held him and then be
fell, striking the pavement with a sicken
ing thud. He was dead when reached.
Richardson succeeded in escaping without
â¢injury.
The loss on the building and contents
was about $500,000, abont two-thirds cov
ered by insurance.
MAIL BOX BOBBERS' CAUGHT.
Members of a Dangerous Gang Behind
the Bars at. Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., April 3.â dangerous
gang which has for three months kept the
Chicago postal authorities excited and
anxious by the robbery of mail box con
tents is now believed to be under lock and
key, the last arrest, that of Hiram L.
Leach, being made to-day by Postal In
spector Stuart in a West Side saloon.
Scores of checks mailed by business men
were taken from the stolen letters, and in
many instances the checks were cashed by
innocent persons. The gang is supposed
to have worked with duplicate keys to the
mail boxes, as the locks of none were
broken. It is supposed the robbers re
turned those letters they found did not
contain checks. Eight other members of
the gang have been caught, most of them
while in the act of trying to cash large
checks at banks where they were made
payable.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
RISING RIVERS
ON THE RAMPAGE
An Increase in Volume of
the Flood Reported in
Many Places.
At East St. Louis the Situation
Is Becoming Exceedingly *
Serious.
Along the Levee Districts in the
Sonth Thousands Continue to
Battle for Life.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April The river at
this point continues to rise and at 6 p.m.
stood at $8.8 feet above low-water mark.
All the river front is under water, except
; a space of six blocks from Locust street to
Walnut. Hundreds of laborers are em
ployed in carrying perishable goods from
the levee warehouses to higher ground.
The stretch of low ground, beginning at
Carr street and running north four miles
to Chain of Rocks and two miles wide, is
under water. Lumber yards in the vicin
ity are in danger of being swept clean.
Losses have been materially reduced by
the warnings sent out by the Government
i Weather Bureau. Telegraphic reports to
the Weather Bureau here have come to
day from points in this district, and re
port an increase in the volume of the
river flood due to heavy rains of the past
twenty-four hours.
The Osage and Gasconade rivers, rising
in the Ozark Mountains and subject to
rapid and extreme fluctuations, had to
day overflowed their banks and were re
ported rising. The feeling of security in
East St. Louis is giving way to anxiety.
Their only reliance is placed in the thirty
six-foot roadbeds of the railroads.
But Cahokia Creek, which cleaves the
city at about its central longitude, is to be
reckoned with. Back water from the
river can find an entrance behind the
railroads through the Cahokia, and all
the records of the 1893 flood will be re
peated. An evening journal prints numer
ous telegrams from points in Illinois,
Missouri, Arkansas and Nebraska, and all
note rising rivers since Friday morning.
Railroad truffle here is not satisfactory,
but is not paralyzed.
Reports received to-day from points as
far north as Dubuque are of a very gloomy
character and state that the flood situa
tion is constantly growing worse and more
threatening.
All trains running south on the east
side of the river have been abandoned,
the tracks having been either washed
out or so greatly softened as to be dan
gerous. : â :':*â '_ -â â¢
The reports from up the Missouri are
equally disheartening. From Jefferson
City comes news that large tracts of the
lowlands in that part of tha State are
under water, and as all the tributaries of
the river are full to overflowing and are
ouring great volumes of water into the
main stream it is predicted that the worst
of the trouble is yet to come.
MEMPHIS, Turns., April 3.â Matters
are becoming very serious in the neigh
borhood of Austin, a few miles south of
here and just beyond the Mississippi line.
The river is so high that the levee is in
the greatest danger. If it should break
five counties would be flooded and an im
mense amount of damage done.
The weather is dark and gloomy and a
fine rain is falling, which still further de
presses the people. News from up the
river gives no encouragement of better
times in the near future* Everything pos
sible has been done and is being none to
strengthen the levees.
The great danger now is that the levees
will be cut by people on the other side of
the river. Armed men are patrolling
them night and day to prevent cutting,
and they open fire on every one approach
ing tbe levee.
Last night two men were killed at differ
ent points along the river bank. 'They
had crossed the river from the Arkansas
side in boats with the intention of blowing
up the levees and thereby lessening the
pressure on their own side. A second
man in one of the boats jumped overboard
when the guards opened fire and started
to swim to the western bank, but was
drowned, for no man can swim the Mis
sissippi River at that point in the present
condition of the stream.
That no mistake was made as to the
character of the men was shown by the
discovery of a can of dynamite in each
boat, evidently intended to be used in
making a break.
So far it has been possible to guard the
levees, but any night some one may suc
ceed in landing unobserved in the dark
and blowing up the levee. Consequently
the people are kept in a condition of
nervous tension.
SIOUX CITY, lowa., April The rise
in.the Missouri River by the backing up of
tributary streams is again making trouble
near here. Local 1 officials of the Omaha
and Milwaukee roads were notified to-day
that washouts are occurring everywhere
and bridges and culverts constantly going

On the Milwaukee, communication be

Elk Point is missing and all repairs made

Nebraska agents of the Pacific Short
Line report their track a quagmire and
all streams bank full or overflowing. From
the southern part of the county it is an
nounced the Little Sioux is again flooding
the bottoms. The Floyd is bank full and
threatens to repeat the mischief of a fort
night ago, in Sioux City. It is raining
bard and all streams are still rising.
HURON, S. D., April Two inches of
rain has fallen here the past forty-eight
hours * and It is still coming down in tor
rents. . There is more water in sight here
than at any time since the foundation of
the city. There is water everywhere.
Bridges are torn out and thousands of

FATHER CORCORAN' S ESTATE.
Will of the Well- Known Priest to Be
. 'Contested by Daniel "and Hannah
! ' , -. ', Corcoran.
BOSTON, Mass., April 3â ln the Suf
folk. County Probate Court to-day were
filed notices of objections to the will of
the late Rev. William ,J. Corcoron. \ for
twenty years rector of St. Vincent's Cath
olic Church at South Boston, by his uncle
Daniel and his aunt Johanna or Hannah
Corcoran of San Francisco, his only next
of kin and heirs at law. They do not give
the grounds on which they contest. Father
Corcoran died a month ago, leaving from
$25,000 to $35,000 in personal property and
real estate, of which the contestants were
given each $100, and the bulk went to
charity, mainly for the establishment of a
non-sectarian home for invalids, to be run
in connection with Carney Hospital.
His bequest for this included his mag
nificent county seat at Ded ham. The ex
ecutors of the will say they do not know
the contestants or their grounds, and
promise a hard legal fight. It is under
stood that General Patrick A. Collins,
now Consul-General at London, will look
out for Carney Hospital's interest on his
return. %'.%Â».i%J\.
WBX JFBED GRAUT BB BUSED.
more Salary in Police Commissioner
Than Assistant War Secretary.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 3 -Colonel
Fred Grant's friends explain his refusal
to enter the War Department by pointing
.out' that the salary of the place Is $500
less than the colonel is now receiving as
Police Commissioner. As his expenses in
Washington would be greater than here,
he could' hardly afford to make the
change: ';;p^7. : "-',-_, *
It Is known that Colonel Grant desired
his old place as Minister to Austria, which
has been given to Charlemagne Tower of
Pennsylvania. Senator Piatt, on behalf
of the State organization, tried to secure
this appointment for him. Colonel Grant
has not concealed his desire to go back to
Vienna, where he has many friends, and
it is understood that the appointment of
another to the place is a disappointment
to him.
He will continue in his present office,
now that the Greater New York police bill
has been laid aside until the new adminis
tration comes in, and it is said he is as
sured of being one of. the Commissioners
when the new board is formed. If be
does not take this office some other equally
good will be provided for him in recogni
tion of his services.
The regulars have so far obtained very
little from the administration. They did
not urge Andrew G. White or General
Horace Porter, who have received the two
foreign missions given to New York.
TO RE ACB A CRISIS.
Affairs in the Ranks of the Theosophists
Complicated.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 3.-Affairs in
the ranks of tbeosoptiists of tbis city and
of the entire country as well will reach a
crisis to-morrow night, when Mrs. Kath
erine A. Tingley will return to New York.
Mrs. Annie Besant has been here for
several weeks delivering Sunday
lectures at Ghickering â¢ Hall. She has
been prominently identified with the Eng
lish branch of theosophists for years. -B_e
and Mrs. Tingley are not on good terms.
Up to date she has had clear sailing for
these lectures on account of the absence of
Mrs. Tingley. But this time it will be
different. Mrs. Tingley and her band of
around-tbe-world crusaders will arrive in
New York to-morrow evening, and will
lose no time in preparing for action. Ar
rangements have, been made and invita
tions sent out for a reception for them in
Madison-square Garden Concert Hall at
8 p. m. to-morrow, the same time when
Mrs. Besant will lecture in Chickerint?
Hall.
Thus they throw down the gauntlet to
their rival from across the sea, and will
make every effort to draw theosophists
away from Mrs. Besant's lecture to their
own reception.
The question now puzzling the theoso
phists of this city is where to go to-mor
row night â to Mrs. Besant's lecture or to
Mrs. Tingley's reception.

XO BESEPIT SPECULATORS.
Montreal Operatives Attempt to Influence
the Wheat Market. :?;'.;
NEW YORK, N.Y., April 3â A Times
special from Montreal says: A bold at
tempt is to be made to-night or Monday
night to influence the Chicago wheat mar
ket for the benefit of Montreal speculators.
The Metropolitan la last night's i issue
summed up the situation in a nutshell as
follows:
TLe statement that the syndicate of the
local speculators who were in the Chicago
pork deal a year ago were going to give
the shorts in May wheat a hustle in the
Windy Bity is looked upon as merely a
feeler intended to frighten the weaker
shorts into covering. There is plenty of
long wheat held here which the holders
would be only too glad to get rid of, and if
it can be done by spreading rumors as to
the way in which they are going to twist
the short interest in Chicago they are not
to be blamed lor trying it; but it should
be remembered that Chicago is a big city
and a long way off, and it is no easy mat
ter for Montreal speculators to work a suc
cessful corner on the speculative fraternity
of that bustling village.
The scheme is to be worked as the pork
scare was worked a year ago, by getting a
certain newspaper man to offer a story to
the Chicago papers to the effect that the
syndicate here is to corner wheat and has
already 8,000,000 bushels under contract.
YACHT RACIXG ASSOCIATION.
Call Issued for the Formation of ss Xew
Organization.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 3.-The long
talked-of National yacht racing associa
tion will soon take a definite form. A call
was issued yesterday to all the yacht rac
ing associations in the country, as wall
as to all prominent yacht clubs, not
directly connected with such associations,
asking them .to send delegates to a con
vention or conference of yacht clubs and
associations, which will be held at the
Fifth Avenue Hotel in this city on May 1.
The general idea of the promoters of
this yachting conference is to discnss and
determine upon such action as may be
advisable to effect the adoption of uniform
racing rules by the various yacht racing
organizations and clubs of the United
States and Canada.
From present indications the meeting
will be largely attended, as assurances
have been received that over two-thirds
of the yacht clubs in the United States
and Canada will be represented.

TO ANNUL THOSE
FOREIGN CHARTERS
Passage of a Significant
.; Bill in the Kentucky
Legislature.
It Will Compel Southern Pacific
Men to Obey the Laws
of the State!
But the Measure Will Be Fought
â¢ When It R aches the Upper
.*_ â '"â Â£"â¢â¢> House.
FRANKFORT, Ky., April 3,â The
House of Representatives passed the bill
recently introduced by Representative
Rice of Grayson County relating to cor
porations, the effect of which is to give
the Attorney-General power to annul cor
porate charters by proceedings in court.
The bill was originated at the Instance
of Attorney-General Taylor and was
passed, by. reason of the failure of a great
number of . corporations to report and
comply with the law regulating corpora
tions chartered under the laws of Ken
tucky. .The bill is very short aud states
that whenever any corporation doing busi
ness in this State shall fail or refuse to
comply with the law goVerning such cor
porations, or shall violate the terms of the
articles of such corporation, or wilfully
do anything contrary thereto to warrant
such action, the Attorney-General is here
by authorized to bring .suit in the fiscal
court of the . commonwealth, to revoke or
annul the charter of the aforesaid corpora
tion.
Attorney-General Taylor recently filed
suit in the Franklin Circuit Court against
a number of corporations for fines and
penalties for failures to report. Among
these was a suit against the Southern Pa
cific Railroad and for several hundred
thousand dollars. This corporation being
a foreign company, and having practi
cally no tangible property in Kentucky
upon which process could be had should
judgment be rendered asainst the com
pany, the Southern Pacific Company in
the face of its repeated promise failed and
continued to fail to report.
The present law provides only for pen
alties, and Attorney-General Taylor be
lieves this insufficient, and while he has
no doubts of gaining the suits now pend
ing against the Southern Pacific and other
corporations he thinks this is not enough
power, and the remedy afforded in the act
now pending will place the Southern Pa
cific at the mercy of the officers of the
State, who will have the life of the big
company in jeopardy until they conform
to the law as other citizens.
The Southern Pacific people are not
aware of the full force of the act, and
there Is nothing in its text to indicate that

California concern, together with half a
dozen other corporations. Last winter a
bill was introduced to repeal the charter
of this company, and the Southern Pacific
people kept a big lobby of lawyers here
during the entire session. No fight was
made in the lower house, but a desperate
fight was made in the Senate, and the bill
was defeated. The Southern Pacific peo
ple are certain to make a fight on the
present bill when it reaches the Senate,
and they see its far-reaching force. They
will hardly do so, however, without first
settling tbe suits now pending in court
against them for open violation of the law.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. April
3.â Stanford held a most successful field
day on the campus this afternoon. It
was the fourth annual try-out, and will
determine, to a considerable degree the
Â° makeup of the team which is to try con
clusions with the University of California
athletes on April 24. The weather was a
trifle cool and a wind blew upon the backs
of 'the sprinters as they came down on
the homestretch. This in a measure ac
â¢ counts for the fast time made on the
sbort'dis'tance event-*, but the audience
which tilled the bleachers and part of the
diamond expected to see some records
broken.
The first event which raissd the en -
thusiasm of the spectators to a high pitch
was the final of the 100-yard dash. Brun
ton, 'who ran from scratch, covered the
distance in the remarkable time of 9 4-5
seconds. Three watches caught him at
those figures, while the fourth took him
at a shade under ten seconds.
Young Walsh, the soeedy walker and
| captain of the Lowell Hitrh School, com
pleted the mile in 7 mm. 45 sec. Consid
â¢ ering the fact that be is huff.ring from a
cold and walked part of the distance
â¢ against a breeze he made a most credita
ble showing. Adams of Stanford was ap
plauded for the good .showing he made in
the same event.
Jfidward Morgan '00 did even more than
was expected of him in the 120-yard
hurdles. Without knocking over a single
hurdle he crossed the tape in the fast
time of 15 4-5 seconds. The coast record,
made by Henry of the University of Cali
fornia, is 15% seconds.
â¢ John Brunton '99 distinguished him
self again in the quarter-mile run. He
came in first, his time being 51 3-5 sec
ond. This clips nearly a second from the
previously existing college record.
In spite of a troublesome knee Charles
Dole beat his own record, which is also the
best on the coast. He cleared the cross
bar neatly at 10 feet 11 inches, actual
measurement. His best previous record
was 10 ieet 10 1 2 inches.
Fickert broke the college record in tbe
16-pound hammer throw~by hurling the
weight 127 feet 11 inches.

tween Billy Ernst of Brooklyn* and Mike
Harris of ibis city.but Ernst* bad things
all his own way from the gong-sound and
until "BrooElyn Jimmy" Carroll stopped
the contest after one 7 minute and thirty
seconds of the second* round in order to
prevent Harris being knocked out.
'Jack Williams of Now Orleans and Mike
Farragber of Youngstown, in a ten-round
bcfut, put up the best fight of the night.
Williams' peculiar style amused the sports, 1
but they were %uick to recognize his light- ,
ing qualities, in the first three rounds
Williams used a left lead, followed by ft
right uppercut that proved very effective.
It was not until the fourth that Farragner
was able to reach the Southerner, and
from that to the finish it was a hot battle.
Farragher was the hardest hitter, but
Williams showed great cleverness in
avoiding the Ohio man's swings. It was
give and take up to the last round, but
Williams had the best of the final three
minutes. Both were applauded, and the
referee very properly declared the bout a
draw. The boys will meet again next
Saturday at the National Sporting Club.
The first preliminary was won by "Kid"
Madden, who- defeated Maxey Haugh in
tbe sixth round. *

an excellent showing.
The second contest was tnat between

age was 23 9-17. This gives Catton three

SAN MATEO'S VICTORY.
Case Brought to Test the Val di<y of an
Ordinance Decided in the
City's Favor.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April &.â A
.est. case brought to j try the validity of
an ordinance of the city of San Mateo was
decided by Judge Buck in favor of the
city yesterday. The ordinance provides
tbat "It shall be uniawlul for any person
to establish, maintain or carry on the
business of 'a public laundry or wash
house, where articles are washed or
cleansed for hire, within the city of San
Mateo, except within that part of said city
which lies without the district bounded
and described as follows," whici district
is then described. It is further provided
that a breach of this provision shall con
stitute a nuisance and be punishable by a
tine of $300, or three months' imprisonment
or both.
Hong Wah applied for a license to carry
on a laundry within the prohibited limits,
and, being refused, the Chinaman epened
a wash-house notwithstanding. He was
arrested for violating the ordinance.
Through his attorney he then sued out a
writ of habeas corpus. The case was
brought to a hearing and the ordinance
upheld and the prisoner remanded. Tne
case will be appealed to the Supreme
Court.
: The decision rendered by Judge Buck is
far-reaching in its scope, affecting every
ordinance of like nature enacteu by any of
the cities in the State. :

FLEES FROM CLOVERDALE.
Betting on the Carson Fight Caused the
Downfall of a Prosperous
Restaurateur. ' .':
CLOVERDALE, Cal. â¢ April : 3 -The
City Restaurant and Hotel suspended
business to-day in a peculiar manner. At
noon this apparently prosperous-hostelry
was full of patrons, but 'to-night 1 ' they
were seeking supper and, accommodations
elsewhere. George G. -Vickerson, tbe' pro
prietor, with his wife and child, uncere
moniously left on the. afternoon train,
going toward San Francisco. He left be
hind an empty cupboard, ; unpaid em
ployes and a host of other creditors.
There is very little lelt in ti;e .way of
furniture or fixings to satisfy tbe creditors.
Everything of value had beforehand been
mysteriously spirited away.
Vickerson attended . the.-Corbett-Fitz
simmons prize-fight, and it is the surmise
of many that he lost heavily on the fight,
as he was always a stronc Corbett man.
His place is now in the Sheriff's hands,
and a warrant is out for his arrest. "\ -

AMERICA WINS

Eaton of Chicago Beats
Longhead,: the Canadian
Champion.
The Two Cracks of the Indoor
Cycle Tournament Meet in a
Ma Race.
B cker Won th* Mile Open Profes
sional Event From Jones, Stevens
and Eaton.
The closing night of the two weeks'
indoor bicycle meet drew an immense
crowd to the Mechanics' Pavilion last
night.
The principal event of the evening was
the matching of Jay Eaton of Chicago
and Fred J. Loughead of Canada for a
purse of $250, best two In three mile heats,
paced.
The first heat was won by Eaton alter a
hard race. Loughead. st-rted the sprint
on the sixth lap and held the lead until
the last turn was reached, when Eaton
came by with a bis rush on the outside.
The time was fastâ 2:ll 3-5.
There was trouble over the second heat.
Twice the men started and the pacemaker
cut out too hot a clip and the men could
not catch him and were called off. At last
thy got away good and everything went
well until the pacemaker dropped out.
Eaton had the lead and Loughead jumped
him and cut down close on the west bane,
throwing Eaton out of his stride and he
quit. Loughead came on at a "rattling
clip and won. Eaton protested to Ref
eree - James M. Hamilton, but he ruled
there was no foul.
The third heat was made interesting by
putting in Wells to race, and be made it
as fast as he could., Loughead had first
place behind him. bu; .when the pacer
dropped out Eaton came up on the out
side ond won by a good margin in 2:12 1-5.
The victory was liberally applauded and
stamped Eaton as worthy of the . title
Eastern race---oefs have given him, the
"indoor king."
Some good riding was seen in the heats
of the mile open, professional. Jones won
the first, Allen running second, ln the
second heat Wells had the lead and whs
all but a winner when Stevens nipped
nim out at the tape. Eaton and Becker
were the only starters in the third. They
made a snow ride of it and finished on
about even terms, Eaton getting the posi
tion.
"Bob" Terrill and McFarland rode the
fourth heat in 2:27." They made a good
race of it for a two-man heat â more than
can be said for Eaton and Becker in the
previous heat.
Jones, Wells, Allen and Stevens rode in
the first semi-final. They put up a splen
did ride, and the result was in doubt right
to the tape. Stevens and Jones finished
almost a -end heat, the judges finally de
claring Stevens the winner. Wells tried
hard to get through, but was on the in
side and could not pass.
Â±Jecker, McFarland, Eaton and "Bob"
Terrill rode the second semi-final. Mc- j
Farland git a bad start, and it was al- |
most like a handicap for him for half: the
ride. Eaton, irom last position, forged |
ahead on the sixth lap, and despite the ef- I
lorts of the oi tiers was never headed.
j Becker was second.
This qualified Eaton, Stevens, Jones and
Becker ior the final. Eaton started the
-print on the sixth lap, but Becker swung
wide and crowded him on the last lap and
he was out of it. Becker held his sprint
to the end and won by a bare margin over
Jones in 2:20 2-5. Stevens was a close
third.
Following is the summary:

THRASEED THE ATTORNEY
Troub c Over an Engineer's
Housekeeper Ends in the
Courts.
Kate Kidney Sue* for Wages and
Fra*. Schilling I* Her Doughty ;
Champion.
BacK of an innocent-looking little suit
for wages in the Justice Court is a story
that tells graphically of the injured dig
nity of a former candidate for Justice of
the Peace. The suit is entitled Kate Kid
ney vs. William Began, and the action is
for $-26 30 claimed. to be balance due for
services as a housekeeper. Regan is as
sistant engineer of the Baldwin Hotel
electric-light and gas plant. *
It appears that Attorney Frank Schil
ling was. somewhat enamored of pretty
Kate, and* that he called often attired in
the black broadcloth suit, silk tile and
white tie that he purchased to make his
campaign for the Justice bench at the
dom.cile over which she presided.
Keean wns not favorable to Schilling's
siege at the heart of '.is housekeeper, be
cause he did not caie to lose so competent
a custodian of his home, and on more th.
one occasion words that were nut exactly
courteous passed between them.
The climax came one night when Regan
returned home at 12 o'clock and found
that the legal light had prolonged his
visit to that hour. The engineer knew all
about and was partial to electric. lights,
but he did not like legal lights, so he pro-,
ceeded to make it very tropical for Schil
ling. *'â 
'. He chased the attorney about the apart
ment and down the stairs to the tune of
the housekeeper's screams, and then pro
ceeded to finish the job artistically by
rolling his victim in the gutter, which was
conveniently near and tilled witn mud
and water. .
By the time the unfortunate Schilling
escaped his black suit was a mas* of â  mud,
his while tie was under his ear and un
recognizable as to color, and tbe tile was
a hopeless wreck. ~7vifs^_-gg9&Â£Â£P} | S|
, Miss Kidney apparently sided .with
Schilling in his quarrel with the enraged
engineer, for she immediately threw up
her position and sought work elsewhere.
Then she sued as stated, claiming that
THE .SAN, FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
hough she had been engaged as a house
keeper on February 15, 1896, at a salary o 1
$20 per month; and had worked until
March 10, 1897, she had received but $30
on account, and that at the very outset of
her engagement, .
Regan says that Schilling has urged his
ex-housekeeper on to begin tbe suit and
that there will be some interesting devel
opments before the case is settled.
The matter was up before Justice Barry
yesterday, and though Attorney O'Brien
represented Miss Kidney, Schilling broke
into the examination of witnesses so often
tbat Justice Barry had to tell him to sit
down.V^VBSBMn-RHR4BBB3M
"But I am an interested party," said
Schilling.
"Sit down," roared the Justice, and
Schilling sat.
SHOT IN THE HIP.
Fred Kolman Wounded by His Brother
la-Law, Who Charges Him With
Burglary.
There was a decided sensation at Fourth ,
and Howard streets last night at about 11
o'clock, caused by the sharp report of a re
volver.
Fred Kolman, a cook by occupation and
a well-known petty larceny thief, was shot
in the back by his brother-in-law, William
J. Sinole, proprietor of the Oiympia hotel
in the Potrero.
Recently between 400 and $500 worth of
jewelry and clothing and some money
nave been stolen from the hotel and
Sinole suspected Kolman. He met him
at Fourth and Howard streets last night
and charged*^ him with robbing him.
j Sinole attempted to arrest Kolman and
the latter put bis hand in his hip pocket
i as if to draw a revolver.
! Sinole whipped out his revolver, think-
I ing that Kolman was going to shoot and
j Kolman wheeled round and -started to
i run. Just then Sinole fired and the bullet
lodged in Kolman's hip.
Policemen Chambers and Koegel heard
the shot and placed Sinole under arrest
for assault to murder. Sinole preferred a
charge of burglary against Kolman and
after he had been taken to the Receiving
Hospital and his wound attended to he
was locked up in the City Prison. The
j wound is not serious.

An Effort May Be Made to Put Off

Theodore Durrant's last hope of relief
from the State courts was knocked out
yesterday by the Supreme Court, wnich
declined to interfere with the judgment of
the trial court.
Tbe sentence tbat consigned Durrant to
the gallows was brief. It runs: "'Rehear
ing d-nied, April 2, 1897, Beatty C. J. dis
senting." Immediately upon the forego
ing being recorded the remittitur or final
judgment was forwarded to the Superior
Court. It is as follows: _

Whereupon it l* adjudged and decreed by

I, T. H. Ward. Clerk of the .Supreme Court of
the State of California, do hereby certiiy . that
tne foregoing is a true copy of an original
judgment entered in the above entitled cause
aits the 3d day of April, 1897, and now remain

Durrani's attorneys made a hard fight
to have the Supreme Court grant a new
trial. They emphasized the point that
the prisoner did not hare a fair trial be
cause the public and the' press were de
manding hiÂ« life. A month ago, however,
the higher court filed an opinion confirm
ing tne judgment of the lower court, hold
ing that the evidence was conclusive and
tbe verdict must stand. Chief Justice
Beatty rendered a dissenting opinion,
holding that there were some doubts as to
the prisoner's guilt, the evidence being
circumstantial. Thirty days were allowed
to intervene before the final judgment of
the higher court was handed down. In
the meantime tbe prayer for a rehearing
was presented and, as stated yesterday,
denied.
The remittitur, will be spread upon the
minutes of Superior. Judge Bahrs' court
to-morrow .and Durrant will be re
sentenced some time in the latter part of
next week. â  â â  'â  ~.
It is understood i tnat Durrant's attor
neys will make one more effort to save
their client from the gallows by appealing
to the United Stales Courts. In order to
do so it will be necessary to prove tnat the
defendant was deprived- of some of his
rights guaranteed by the United States
constitution. Whether the case will ever
reacn tbe United States Supreme Courtis
a matter ol conjecture.
Two years ago yesterdayâ April 3,
1895 the body of Blanche Lamont, who |
had been murdered by. W. H. T. Durrant,
was found in the dark and forbidding I
belfry ol Emmanuel Baptist Church. A !
remarkable -coincidence . in connection j
wiih the trial of the nineteenth century's I
most remarkable criminal, Durrant, is j
the fact that the legal, machinery of tbe
State of California came to a laÂ«t stop in

Ten Tears of Acknowledged Success

"REPUTATION WORLD WIDE
(San Francisco .Examiner. Dec. 31. 1896.)
The sense and good judgment of the
sick man or sick woman who presents hia
or her case to Doctor Sweany for treat-
ment becomes more apparent every day.
Tbat his marvelous success as a physi-
cian has placed him on the top round of
the ladder of fame there is no longer any
doubt. He has for trie last twenty-five
years been battling against disease with a
courage and tenacity which have won for
him that success which will inscribe his
name imperishably upon the tablets of
fame among the great men of the present,
past and future ages. In him can be
found the noble and good principles
which make the esteemed citizen, the
honorable business man and the success-
â¢ ful physician. _____
OF PRE-EMINENT SKILL.
..(San Francisco Call, December 25, 1896.)
Among the doctors of renown residing
in San Francisco there is one who is rec-
ognized as one of the comparatively few
great men of the medical world. For
many years Dr. F. L. Sweany, the dis-
tinguished specialist, has been engaged
in the practice of his profession in this
city, and his career has been one of honor
and success that is without a parallel in the
medical history of the coast. He is re-
garded by all as a great physician and a
tkilled surgeon, whose mission on earth,
as daily demonstrated in his practice, is
to intelligently treat the sick, to relieve
pain and suffering and to cure disease.
He benefits humanity in a manner that
wins for him the undying gratitude of his
patients and the congratulations and
plaudits of the World.
RECOGNIZED ABROAD
(St. Louis Republican, May, 1896.)
Dr. Sweany's thorough knowledge of
medicine, his ability as a physician, his
integrity and sincerity of purpose is rec-
. ognized by tbe entire populace of this
country. As a specialist his extensive ex-
perience in both hospital and private prac-
tice in this and othe.- countries has
thoroughly prepared him for the class ol
3 proiessional work which heretofore has
" been so sadly deficient in the medical pro-
fession. 'pfcr- 1 â¢.>'?.â â¢â¢*
TRIUMPHANT SUCCESS.
(San Francisco Chronicle, Feb. 9, 1897.)
. Ten years of unparalleled success in the
practice of medicine in San Francisco has
stamped Dr. Sweany as the greatest spe-
cialist of the age. Specialists have come
and gone. Others will come and go the
same as those before them, leaving their
patients poorer and uncured.
"' In every State in the Union there are
â¢strong, nappy and healthy men and women
wno testify that they owe their lives to
p Dr. Sweany's saving skill. These LIVING
MONUMENTS to his unvarying success
number high into the thousands, forming
the proudest record of perfect cures ever
made by an American physician.

train was gone through from one end to
the other. The amount taken from pas
sengers and from the express-cars could
never be fully ascertained, although it
was known to be large, but it was positively
known that $2400 was obtained from four
pouches of registered mail matter that j
were carried off by tha bandits. Inspector
George H. Waterbury of. the Denver !
postal division was detailed on the case,
and has been working on it ever since the
robbery. His suspicions fell on True,
who was discharged from the Union Pa
cific service a few weeks before the hold
up, and who disappeared immediately
afterward, but not before he had dis
played more money than he was ever be
fore known to possess. True had been a
switchman at Ogden, and was known to
be a bard character.
Waterbury also made up bis mind that
there were others concerned in the rob
bery, but he was after True, and he finally
got him.
The fugitive was traced from one local
ity to another until he was located here,
and then Chief Inspector Monroe of the
California aivision was notified by tele
graph. Yesterday a telegram was received
from the San Francisco office stating that
a warrant for True's arrest lad been is
sued, and on this .the Sheriff _ took the
fugitive into custody to-day to await the
arrival of a postal inspector from San
Francisco. He. is expected here to-mor
row. -â¢â s.fi%
True at first prepared ' to resist arrest,
but when be saw that the Sheriff was
ready for any emergency he gave in and
submitted bis wrists to the handcuffs. The
ex-switchman denies that he had any
hand in the robbery, and says that it is a
case of mistaken identity. He professes
entire willingness to go back to Utah to
face the charges airainst him.
He will be taken to San Francisco until
the proper extradition papers are brought
to California by Inspector Waterbury. ;.*

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1 897.
DOCTOR SWEANY,
Whose Reputation Is Established by
Ten Years of Acknowledged Success
at 737 Market Street, San Francisco.
Man was constituted to excel every liv-
ing thing in sexuality as well as intellect-
ual or moral endowments. But how im-
paired are most men. Not one in hun-
dreds but is more or less shrunken ana
weakened and should feel humbled in
view of their sexual inferiority.
A prince, heir to the throne of a great
nation, with all the honor, prestige and
priv.lege of his birthright, if poorly sexed
and undeveloped is less happy tban his
well-sexed subject. How to enlarge and
restore yourself to sexual perfection con-
cerns every living man, woman and child
more than all else combined. The im-
provement of gender proffers the best in-
vestment possible. All can grow richer
and happier faster by curing its ailments
and restoring its vigor and size tban by
any other means.
ABUSE OF NATURE
Of many men becoming physically un-
able to perform their functions may be
hereditary, a total neglect of the wants of
nature or the abuse of nature, or it may
be the foliles of their youth in acquiring
abominable habits that are sapping their
life's blood. . .
THE EFFECT
Is apparently and easily recognized in
the faces of these poor miserable crea-
tures living wrecks of manhood, living
scourges to their family and themselves,
| daily wreaking in" the throes of bodily
! pain and menial distresses, the gloomy
! lorebodings of the dark, unlimitless
j chasm yawnin_ for their entry. Unfit for
i any physical or mental vocation, they be-
come morose, sullen and melancholy;
there is no enjoyment for them. Suffer-
ing agonies beyond description, their
mind . becomes a- diseased, immaterial
mass, conjunng up visions and hallucina-
tion. The thought alone of such a condi-
tion is something awful to contemplate.
Their body is a mass of flesh and blood
diseased in every portion, with which
nature battles daily, only to eventually
succumb to its mighty ravages, and the
victim's body, emaciated beyond descrip-
tion, bones shrunken and scarcely a ves-
tige of the organs left, is borne away to
the scene whence no traveler returns.

THE CURE.
' No physician on the earth has had more
experience or more success in the cure
of wrecked manhood and its consequen-
tial diseases than Dr. F. L. Sweany. He
can positively and permanently strengthen
your weakene 1 organs and restore your
failing manhood. He has practiced ten
years in San Francisco, and his record of
permanent cures has secured for him the
well-earned reputation of being the lead-
ing specialist of the nineteenth century.

the trouble on the islands and what steps
the admiral. would take to quiet matters

evening a prominent lawyer of this city
received from an officer on the Philadel

The mission of tbe Philadelphia is sim
ply to carry to Honolulu the United States
Minister who is to succeed the representa

Some time this afternoon Admiral
Beardslee received a cipher wire from Sec

ELECTRIC BELTS.
DON'T think that a strip of leather
with a few pieces of copper and zinc at-
tached, which is to be moistened with
vinegar and tied around the waist will
ever cure you.
CURE ALLS.
DON'T believe any man who claims
that he has a formula which will cure
each and every case. No one medicine
has been or ever will be discovered that
will cure every case of any disorder.
Scientific Treatment.
In Seminal "Weakness, like all other ail-
ments, the peculiarities shown in each
case will differ and each case must be
studied by itself and treated according to
the conditions existing in that particular
case. No two cases can be cured with the
same treatment, as no two cases are alike.
This is why Doctor Sweany has no single
remedy which bedeals outas a "cure-all,"
nor any mechanical contrivances such as
"electric belts," which are heralded to the
world as a remedy tor till ills. His med-
ical education condemns such methods.
Every case that he undertakes to cure is
treated scientifically with such remedies
and such means as in his judgment that
particular case requires in order to effect a
speedy and permanent cure.

You cannot sleep, you fume and fret
over trifles, your back is weak and you
are utterly unfit to do your regular
day's work. Do you know what that
all means? It means life to you! Noth-
ing less! That is a hard statement for you
to believe? Don't bs foolish. More harm
will come to you if you neglect these symp-
toms; and they are not all by a long way.
To-day, for a change, look at yourself in
the glass. Are your lips pale? Are your
eyes slightly yellow where they should be
white? Are they a little bit bloodshot?
Have you got what the people who try to
be funny in a theater call "the blues," or
is your memory failing? If you are suf-
fering from any of these thing! just try
and remember what early follies you may
have been guilty of, and if you are certain
that you are innocent of all you may
make up your mind that you have been
straining \ your nervous system in some
other way. Perhaps in worrying over
crops; perhaps about a little matter of af-
fection, and possibly about some specula-
tion. But no matter what the cause, the
result is bound to be as bad in each case.
And the longer you let matter* run the
worse they are going to be. Do you know

men of the present day. And the pity
and the danger of it is that it may strike
without warning from no perceptible
cause. -'Tne organs become swollen and
weakness and premature impotency result.
The symptoms appear slowly, with dull,
heavy, aching pains and a general depres-
sion of the system; despondency and:
gloomy forebodings take the place of light-
hearted happiness and ] ambitious pur-
poses. Sometimes varicocele comes from
blows, falls or strains. Whatever the |
cause- and however slight the attack it
should be attended to at once. No man
can afford to have his whole future b ip-ht-
ed by bis own neglect. Varicocele is a
complaint which the eminent specialist.
Dr. Sweany,. can cure -before your own
eyes while you wait unless it is compli-
cated with other disease..
TO WOMEN.
Dr. Sweawy's help and assistance has at
all times proved to be of the utmost value.
No matter whether they were in the very
bud of young womanhood, whether they
were blushing their first roses as happy or
nnhappv mothers, whether they were in
the prime of matronly womanhood, or
whether they were nearing the change of
life â in each and every instance this emi-
nent specialist's advice has been of untold
value. Painful menstruation, leucorrbcea,
displacement of the womb, and all the dis-
tressing ailments peculiar to the weaker
sex, have been made a special study of by
Dr. Sweany, and in each and every case
be takes peculiar interest.' And he is
especially successful in these, and indeed
ail diseases of women. ','â -' -,-..â¢; <

Cast Ashore on' Netty tears Island. I
; SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 3.â Joe Silva
and a companion . named Baptista, who

DOCTOR SWEANY,
Whose Imputation Is Established by
Ten Tears of Acknowledged Success
at 737 Market St., San Francisco.
Probably of all the diseases which are
most to be dreaded on account tff the fear-
ful consequences that ensue from them is
SYPHILIS.. .
That is the hard and ' harsh name
by which it is known, and*- it h*as
struck terror into many a brave heart.
JtÃut there was never a disease yet which
baffled the skill of all the medical world
for all lime, and now it may be stated as
an accented fact that any case of this
nature is taken to a COMPETENT SPE-
CIALIST in time it may be cured without
the slightest shadow of a doubt.* But here
is where the trouble comes in. There are
any number of people who will pretend
that they can effect a cure, but the. man
.who has such a disease as this should
weigh the thing very carefully in his mind
before accepting the advice of any of these
so-called doctors. With the utmost confi-
dence a man can now go .to the offics
of Dr. F. L. . Sweany, .and no matter
how badly he may 7 have neglected*
himself, no matter what form â¢ the "
disease may have taken, no matter how
many men may have said that the case was
incurable, no matter â : how weary .and
wretched he feels, he may go and consult
Dr. Sweany and come away on the road to
recovery. If you cannot come to. San
Francisco you can write all about your
troubles and you may be certain that your
letter will receive the same consideration
as though you had come in person, and no
one except Dr. Sweany himself will ever
know that you .have written. Your case
will be thoroughly studied and remedies
will be forwarded to you in just exactly
the same way as yon could have got them
lin this city. And this method of treating
country patients has been found, to be
excellent in its good results. Bad blood,
the result possibly of syphilis in parents
or zrandp>arents, often produces skin dis-
eases, such as eczema, blotches, scaly
eruptions, swollen glands and so forth,
and in each and all of these cases, as we'll
as in all other constitutional troubles, the
sufferer will find in Dr. Sweany a friend
n need and one who will prove to be a
friend indeed. His success in all kidney
and bladder troubles has been most
marked, and impotency, varicocele,, hy-
drocele and scrofula are likewise special
features of bis practice, while instances of
premature decay have been treated with
unvarying success. It is no idle boast to
say that all weaknesses of the sexual
organs are more scientifically treated by
Dr. Sweany than by any other physician
on this coast, ' for that fact- is fairly ad-
mitted, and he stands \at the _ very head
and front of his profession, admittedly
without a peer. __i_|^ â¢* * '

Change of Secretaries for
. the Board of Harbor
Commissioners.
Four- Year Position Frovided for
. "Governor Budd's Popular
Right-Hand Man.
Dr. Mathews Slated for the Secretary
ship of the State Board of
Health. '
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 3.â That
important changes are contemplated in
-the various Slate office.", and that these
changes will be effected, is now certain. I
E. D. McCabe, who during the incum
bency -of Governor Budd has so ably
transacted the duties of private secretary,
will be replaced by Peter J. Shields, one
â of the ablest young Democratic politicians
of Sacramento County.
It is further on the programme for E. D.
.McCabe tp succeed J. Keegan, tbo present
Republican secretary of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners.
By reason of the expiration of Dan T.
Cole's of service the Harbor Commis
sion-is now Democratic in complexion,
and McCabe can be billeted on the State
Â° for- Jour years as secretary of the board,
.whereas, should he continue to serve as
Governor Budd's secretary his lease of
official- life would expire in two years.
. Dr. W. P. Mathews, the present State
Librarian, having teen appointed a mem-?,
ber of the- State Board of Health, will
ultimately become secretary of that board.
He has yet a year to serve as Librarian
before the Republicans can lake posses
sion of that institutiou, but he has a
. -friendly doctor holding down, the job of
Bard of Health secretary until his time
arrives for leaving the State Library.
The report goes that the Governor will
- appoint Assemblymen Bridgford and
Caminetti on the recreated code commis
sion, but -this may be conjecture. The
point is raised that Bridgford and Cami
netti, having voted to establish the office,
- cannot serve as commissioners.
Such is said to be the present slate, and
unless a break occurs tbe changes will
take place almost immediately. As is
well known in political circles a
desperate effort was made during
the late session of the Legislature
. to place the State Library positions in the
hands of stanch Republicans, and there
are' several ardent aspirants for the places.
It is whispered that the vacancy occurring
' through the resignation of Library Trus
tee* Baldwin will be tilled by an adherent
of the party Democratic, who will support
some Democrat for the position of Libra

SAN RAFAEL RANCH MYSTERY.
Officers Believe That Wine- Malar Fer
rand 'Was- the Vcf/m cf
Assassination.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 3.â The
mystery surrounding the death of C. E.
Ferrand, t c wine-makor at the San*. Ra
fael ranch, yesterday morning, has not
yet been cleared, but It . is now believed
that the man was murdered. Sheriff Burr
has been investigating the affair.
When discovered the body of Ferrand
was so badly burned that the Coroner
could not discover evidence of violence.
A possibl.* clew has been found through
the presence of two desperate characters
in that vicinity the day previous to the
fire. They called at several house, in
Garvanza and made inquiries concerning
San Rafael ranch. It is possible that tney
know that Ferrand had money about his
cabin and, watcbin** tneir opportunity,
tilled him after the driver went away
with the wagon-load of wine for the city
yesterday morning. After killing Fer
rand the men probably poured gasoiine
over his body and set fire to the piace to
hide traces of the crime. Ferrand was
known as quite a frugal man and he had
cashed an order for $100 with a local firm
the day before his death.
In addition to this, the Coroner has
learned that Ferrand told two country
men that he feared for his life at the
hands of the foreman of the ranch. These
men were Jean Boyer, a bartender, and P.
Cazaux, a barber. Before coing to Gar
vanza to work yesterday morning Ferrand
told them that if be did not come back it
would probably be because he bed been
I murdered.

Davis, in yearn pait a well-known news
paper man of Shasta County, to-day
pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary I
committed at Centerville last fall, when j
he broke into a store to get his favorite !
beverage. The Judge's words in sentenc
ing him were touching in the extreme.
He said:
"Mr. Davis, I have known you for a
lone time. 1 am well acquainted with
your physical weakness, resultant from a
wound in the head. You are an able man, <
a good writer, and have done much to ad- ;
vance the interests of this county. You j
were previously sentenced to prison on a j
frivolous charge.
"In the commission of this serious crime I
you showed no intent.. The pity of the
court is that you are addicted to drink, !
and when under the influence of liquor !
are hardly responsible for your actions. '
You will receive a very lieht sentence, and '
the judgment of the court is that you be :
imprisoned in the State prison at San p
' Quentin for the term of one year."
"Thank you,' replied the defendant, as
he resumed his seat.

. Report of the Deep- Water
Harbor Commission

â¢ ....-.-,.â 
In All Requirements the Site
Â Favored by the People
Excels.
Offers Great Advantages Over Santa
Monica as a Shipping;
Point.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April The
complete report of the Harbor Commis
sion which recently --elected San Pedro in
preference to Santa Monica as the site for
the deep-sea harbor for tl:e Southern Cali
fornia coast as been published. Every
point is covered und the board has appa
rently said the last word possible about
the harbor question. The report discusses
the construction of a breakwater at the
respestive places, approach en, facilities
for refuge and all the various details.
In summing up in favor of San â  Pedro it
says:
Considered as a deep-water harbor for In
ternational and foreign trade, the advantages
which San Pedro has for handling traffic and
for approaches by land are great; considered
as a harbor for the coasting trade; the facili
ties--for handling outweigh the disad
vantage of greater distance from north
ern ports; considered as a harbor of
refuge, the location at San Pedro is likely to
be used . more than the other, thongh the dif
ference may not be great. Considered with
reference to future enlargement and exten
sion, San Pedro offers great advantages over
Port Los Angeles. These advantages mean
that a deep-water harbor at San Pedro would
be more ; useful than a deep-water harbor at
Port Los Angeles. . ... .... v.
In the consideration of all matters bearing
upon '-the selection of the harbor site, this
board has constantly kept In view the neces
sity for such plans and provisions, within the
meaning of the statute, as will best meet all
possible harbor requirementsâ those. of
the present and those that may arise 1 from
future developenmts.
This involves much more tban the simple
location of a -breakwater or devising imper
fect facilities to meet in a more or less limited
manner some of the principal requirements of
a deep-water harbor _ for commerce and of '
refuge. It has appeared clearly the duty of
this board to select that location which will
be capable of development at a reasonable
cost commensurate with tbe, growth of all
classes of commerce on the coast of Southern
California, and which ; under that develop
ment will afford in | the . highest degree the
various land and water facilities : characteris
tic of a complete deep-water harbor.
> Although the location at I Port * Los Angeles
affords * all . that -is needful for a satisfactory
harbor of refuge.it Is deficient in the facilities
necessary for the. harbor for. commerce con-,
templated Wider tbÂ«) ' law. At San Pedro, ou
the other hand, a large expenditure has al
ready been made for the improvement of the
channel leading into the inner harbor and in
the Inner harbor Itself.
The series of examinations made under the
I directions of this, board also show that any
further improvement that may b .- needed can
readily be made, and that the possibilities tor
the further development of the interior har
bor are equal . to any demand upon It which
the future can be expected to make.
It is the conclusion of this board, therefore,
that the opportunity for a harbor ot refuge
as planned lor San Pedro and the availability
of both the interior harbor and Wilmington
Lagoon for improvements and development to
any extent that can now be anticipated meet
more fully the requirements of the law than
tne possibilities offered at Port Los Angeles.

OJAI GOLD DISCOVERIES.
Hundreds of Prospectors Attracted to the
Valley by N^ws cf a Recent
'. Discovery.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 3.â Accord,
ing to * the latest advices from Nordhoff,
in tde Ojai Valley, a big strike made there
by two prospectors Jht\Â» occasioned con
siderable excitement. .-The ore ia not high
grade. It was a few days ago that news
of the discovery reached Nordhoff, and
! for a while it seemed that another whirl-
I wind of excitement was about to sweep
the valley. The news was to the effect that
the miners engaged in the Bonanza shaft
had struck a heavy deposit of free aurifer
ous ore, and by way of confirmation of
this re port, a pan containing ' a quantity
of tbe pulverized quartz, heavily impreg
nated with particles of gold and sub
merged in water, was exhibited about the
village. ' ' .'â  ~ J J-'j '7 ..â â ,*â "
â  j She effect was instantaneous. Moved
by one impulse the rush to the diggings
began. Orville Cline and T. B. t'loyd, the
owners of the Bonanza, stated that there
were fully 500 excited 7 prospectors at
tracted to the vicinity of their location i
within a few hours after the strike was j
made public.
An examination disclosed â¢ that at a
depth of six feet the discoverers had found |
two well-defined auriferous ledges, separ- i
ated by a three-inch stratum of rich yel
low clay. Old miners concur in the belief I
that the two young men, Cline and Cloyd,
have an invaluable possession in the Bo
nanza mine. " * ;
The past week has' witnessed considera
ble activity in the group of locations in
! and about Royal Gorge. The Big Six,
Blue Ledge and Bonanza companies have
at last got fairly down to business and
every exertion is being made to unearth
the treasure which is supposed to lie not
many feet below the surface.

the sack. Here the men receive their pay
at the close ot each day's work.
Eight hundred dollars even in silver is a
powerful' temptation to knights of the
road in these days of hard times. A man
at. boulevard wages weuld have to work a
little more than two years to earn that
much. That sum would buy 10,000
schooners of beer. In view of the risk in
traveling with such an amount of money
at the same' hour of the day and on the
same roads Mr. Bunker has taken a few
simple precautions. He always has some
one with htm in the buggy, and when he
reaches Seventh avenue", wnich leads up
into the picturesque canyon of the Spring
Valley reservoir and ihe Almshouse, he is
met by a mounted policeman, who accom
panies him to the pay station.
A Call reporter went with Mr. Bunker
yesterday, seated behind that retired trot
ter, "Stockton Brown," who made good
time up Gulden Gate avenue, through the
Panhandle and to Seventh avenue, where
the policeman was waiting on a rangy
horse and with a glad smile.
Signs or the boulevard were seen up
the canyon in the shape of surveyor's
stakes on the wooded slopes, with pieces
of white cotton cloth fastened on top of
them. They were sit 100 feet apart,
which will be the width or the new road.
Approaching the reservoir is a deep gully,
wnich will reouire a fill of between twenty
and thirty leet; and about 100 yards ion.:
of this roadway has been filled and
macadamized by the water company.
The first batch of workmen was found
on the Almshouse tract, grading and
smoothing off a piece of tbe new boule
vard, ln making the grade they had been
obliged to cut down and grub out several
cypress and eucalyptus trees of at least
two feet in diameter. The boulevard runs
through a pretty wood here, and looking
north affords a picturesque view of Golden
Gate Park, the Golden Gate and Mount
Tarn pais.
â â¢ From this point, or for about a mile, the
721 laborers are strung up like an army,
and they present a nve.y spectacle.
Passing the Almshouse, he road turns
abruptly to the south, breasting a rise of _
4 per cent grade, and here a large number
of men and teams are at work laying
macadam on the middle of the roadway.
On both sides are gently sloping bills cov
ered with a dense growth of cypress and
eucalyptus.. On the summit of this place
is a beautiful view of the ocean, and in
the foreground on the sandy elopes and in
the gulch between, through which runs a
little stream, cabbages, carrots, beets, tur
nips and artichokes are growing.
Through the middle of tnis pleasant
garden, which flourishes' ail the year
round, runs the track of the Boulevard de
Balboa. It goes downhill into a gulch
the Trocadero Canyon, about thirty feet
deep. The laborers are cutting away the
top of the rise, from which a narrow-gauge
railroad track extends into the rally.
Two dirtcars tandem are hauled up empty
by a team of two horses. The horses are
unhitched and sent downhill . again
When the cars are filled, which task re
quires but a very few minutes, the cars in
charge of a br.ikeman ore turned loo<-e
down*: the; grade and the dirt is dumped
into the canyon. ' At the bottom about
fifty men are engaged in building a culvert
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
to carry off the waters of the Trocadero,
which are heading for that ocean which
Vasco X mies de Ha* boa, soldier of fortune,
dtt-covered so long ago.
Thi.- gulch will be filled up to the
level of the cabbage patch and the
road will lead over it around the sides of
the wooded hills to Ingleside, with a fine
view of the sea all the way.
From the Almshouse to the Trocadero,
a half mile or mure, the 721 laborers were
I strung out, making tne dirt fly with pick
and shovel and wheelbarrow and tram
car. The greater part of this route
belongs to Adolnh Sutro. Even the ground
on winch the caobages and the Egyptian
blood beets are growing ls his. Naturally
he takes a great interest in the work.
He began by donating the roadway 100
feet widt.-, and his good wisnes. a thousand
yards broad. Hence, when he met Mr.
I Bunker at the edge of the garden patch he
1 had a few suggestions to offer, while the
! sail sea breeze tore viciously at his whis
| kers, and while Stockton Brown, gleefully
J snapping his curbrein, lunched upon the
, cabbages that opened their big green petals
! so invitingly at his hoofs.
'"Now, that was a foolish thing they
din;" said the Mayor. -'They named this
I road Balboa boulevard, because it had
I three B's in it. Who in the blank was
I Bal_o_, anyhow? He was only a Spanish
| adventurer, and he didn't do a thing.
I Why didn't they name it after someoody
who did something? There are plenty of
-Europeans and Americans mora dis
tinguished tbantÃaiuoa."
"Well," moralized Mr. Bunker, "he was
about as good at tnat English pirate
Drake, alter whom we named one of the
bay? on this coast."
The transition from buccaneers to cul
verts was easy, Mr. Sutro insisting that
dark redwood should be used instead of
pine.
i But the day was waning and tb" party
went back to the pay station. ' At a quar
ter of 5 p. m. a roan blew a police wuisile
and 700 men all along the line, with picks
and shovels in hand, rushed furiously
toward the pay station and formed in two
lines, each to. ler to receive $1 10 for his
day-, work. The 10 c nts goes to the
Market-street Railway -Company- for far.j
to and' ;rom work and amounts to more
than $80 a day, from people who were
obliged io wall* before they got the joo on
the boulevard.
They bless- the name of Balboa as fer.
vently as they would that of Sntro had
the driveway been called the Sutro boule
vard, for this $1 10 per day buys food and
pays rent for a family; and every dollar of
the eight hundred and odd goes at once
into circulation among the retailers. So
it helps business and makes nearly 700
families happy. Preference is given to
married men and in proportion to the
number ol children in tbe lamily.
Each of the Â£6SO applicants for, work has
signed a blank lorra, riving hi* name, ad
dress, occupation, the fact that he is mar
ried, the v tun ber of persons dependent
upon him for their livelihood, hisag<Â«, the
length of time he has resided in San Fran
cisco and the name of some person as his
reierence. This application is sent to the
Associated Charities for investigation into
the truth of the representations made, and
is returned to the committee 1 wiih a re
port favorable or otherwise.
On these applications 1283 ticket?, a lit
tle less than half the number, have been
issued.- The first batch of tickets entitled
the holder to" fourteen days' employment
on the boulevard. The ones being" given
out now are good for -ten days' work, be
cause the intention is to increase the
force, so as to give tbe waiting applicants
an early turn at the shovel. Of the whole
number of tickets issued 270 were left un
called for. the applicants having) left the
City or gone back to begging nickels irom
passers-by in the neighborhood of the
5-cent restaurants on Clay street-
Yesterday was the seventeenth day of
the work, and the expenditures amounted
to $8933 The total collections have been
$17,104 2); so that a half of the _ fend has"
been < xpend-d on labor and not more than
a third of .the roadway completed. All
the lumber, the tools, etc.. have been do
nated through the exertions of Messrs.
Bunker. and.-. Ellen, are devoting al
most the whole of their time to the project.

BROKEN CONCRETE
RAISES A DOUBT
Mayor Phelan Investigat
ing Folsom- Street
Pavements.
/ â : â ;
The Whole Job May Have to Be
Done Over Again by the
Contractor.
Holes Bored in the Foundation With
the Too of. a Bootâ Tests to Be
\ Made To-Morrow.
Mayor Phelan and Chairman Dvanye
of the ; Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors have ordered work on the
bituminous pavement on Folsom street,
between Third and Fifth, stopped pend
ing an investigation as to the character of
the concrete foundation. â¢ This>Js a por- I
tion of the Folsom-street boulevard, of
which so much has been said and written,
and the Mayor is of the opinion that gross'
neglect, at the very least, has character
ized the work that has been done.
A test of the foundation will be made
to-morrow, and ii the suspicions that now
exist are verified the whole, job may be
condemned. ,7 .;
. Engineer McCnllough, who is the ex
pert "of the Mayor and of the Street Com
mittee, was sent yesterday morning to ex
amine the . work of laying the concrete
foundation, because of reports that it was
not up to specifications.
He stated, on his return, that with the
toe of his boot he bad bored a hole sevtrnl
inches into the concrete, and that it was
so broken in places, from the passage of
teams, as to be unfit to receive the bitu
men. flSfWn
Mayor Phelan called on Superintendent
of Streets Ambrose for an explanation of
the matter, and that official declared that
the work was of first-class character.
Mayor Phelan was not satisfied with the
case as it stood and sent for Expert Hoff
man of the Street Department, who at
first insisted that the work- 1 was done in a
proper manner, but when closely ques-.
tioned admitted that it might have been
better done.
He said that the contractors had taken
up the planking , that protected the con-'
crete because some of the materials bad
been stolen, ana that they attributed the
condition ot the foundation to the passage
of teams over the unprotected concrete.
Mayor Phelan wants more light on the
subject, nnd will make tests to show just
bow good the concrete In. >
-He insists that something must be done,
and done immediately,, otherwise 7 the
heavy teaming will ruin the street in a few
months, as the foundation is the princi
pal part of the work. 'â 
The contract to pave the roadway for
the two blocks mentioned was let by the
last Board of Supervisors to E. G. Keen,
who agreed to take the job for $12 000
which included tbe placing of curbs and
cesspools, as well as the bitumen with its
concrete foundation: If to-morrow's tests
are not satisfactory the board will be asked
to insist that the concrete be rclaid. .

MAYOR INVESTIGATING.
Looking Closely Into the ! xpendltu.es
of the District Attorney's Office.
Mayor Phelan . is preparing a com
munication to the Board of Supervisors on
the subject of the expenditures of tbe
District Attorney's office, that is expected
to contain some interesting figures and
facts.
The District Attorney recently applied
to have Attorney Dunne retained as
special counsel in spite ot the tact that
the fund out of which his salary is expected
to come is exhausted. He stated â¢in his
petition that there are now fifty-eight
criminals awaiting trial, and that their
cases should be closely attended to.
Mayor Phelan thinks that it is* strange
that so many cases should be banging fire,
and has sent to the District Attorney for
information as to how long they have been
on the court calendar,' how and by whom
continuances were obtained and other
particulars. He is of the opinion that the
District Attorney should curtail expenses
and keep the work of bis office nearer up
to date.

The trails lending to some of the points of

BY A SCANT NOSE
Scarborough, at 30 to 1,
Took the California
Derby.
The Winner Was Ridden by
Coady, Who Outfiaished
Ted Sloan.
Willie- Martin Worked a Clever Ruse
on the Judgesâ Montallade Won :
v.*."-. and Was Disqualified.
-.The inaugural California Derby, over
.. one* mile and a quarter, with a guaranteed
"value to tbe winner of $4000, was decided
at Ingleside track yesterday and was cap
tured by the 30 to 1 outsider Scarborough
in a furious drive from Scarf Pin, tbe big
son of El Rio Key, barely beating the gal
"laht filly a' nose on the finishing post.
From a spectacular point of view it was
â¢ exciting enough to stir the blood of a mar
ble Roman- gladiator, but from. a time
" stand point and for a race replete witb in
cident? it was a lizzie. '
The 8 to 5 favorite, Howard S., backed
with thousands, finished just beyond the
motley, -and of course this nettled the
tempers of many speculators. But one
thing that excited much, wonderment was
the condition of the track. Whereas in
the past it has been tbe aim to have the
** surface present at; appearance of velvet,
â¢ yesterday it was harrowed up until it
â¢ looked ready â¢- to' be planted with cab
pages. This fact called for much advene
comment ana robbed the big event of
much interest. The winner's time, 2:11"^,
gives an inkling of its Dad condition.
*. Strange to'sav, as a drawing card the race
fell, flat, scarcely attracting more than the
usual Saturday crowd. ;
The three, races run preceding the
"Darby" were not attended by any vast
amount of commotion, but when the odds
against 'the nine starters in tbat event
were posted visitors unpacked their
. valises and shuffled into the ring. How
ard S, with "Skeets" Martin In the saddle,
was the pice of the talent, and through
ouftbe betting ruled a consistent 8 to 5
favorite. Next came the Burns & Water
bouse pair, Altamax and Candelana, at 7
to _, with Scarf Pin, who had receded from
3t04 to 1, third in demand. Atkins &
Loitridge made no secret of the fact that
. they tboug :t their big colt Scarborough
had a royal chance, and bis odds of 30 to 1
were -steadily played down to 12 and 15.
Good Times received the support of many,
who played him on what he ought to do.
After parading past the stand the horses
galloped to the post, and Starter Havey
sept them away with little delay. Pass
in. tbe stand well bunched, the rank out
sider joe Ullman led Scarf Pin a head, fol
lowed by Candelaria and Good Times, the
favorite back among the rear-enders. Be
fore tbe turn down tbe back stretch had
been rounded Sloan, on Scarf Pin. had
taken command, with Thorpe on Cande
laria, and Willie Martin, astride Good
Times, at his heels. There were slight
changes in the positions to the last turn,
where Coady moved up to second piace
with Scarborough. Candelaria, of which
much was expected, was now seen to be
beaten.
Entering the stretch the bay fellow bad
a slight lead over Purser's filly, and trav
eling with bis sweeping stride the outsider
"looked an easy winner. But Scarf Pin did
not intend to give up without a atrusgle,
and gamely responding to Sloan's urging
drew up on nearly equal terms with the
leader at the paddock, and in a erand fin
ish bowed to defeat by a nose.
To Coady's superb riding can be at

tributed the winner's success, and the
California lad received an ovation qn his
return to tbe stand. Altamax ran a sur
prisingly good race, taking third money,
half a length before the favorite Howard
S. The latter was compelled to go the
overland route.
Of the events decided favorites won
three. The only thing worthy of incident
was the disqualifying of B. C. Holly 'Â«.
horse Montallade after be had cleverly
downed the faint-hearted Amelia Fonso.
Willie Martin on the latter mare worked
the threadbare, time-worn gaj of pulling
up when within a few feet of the wire
with a pitiful glance cast at the same time
toward the stand. The Kind-hearted
officiate sympatnized with Willie in his
trouble and as . Montallade was only a
California horse anyway he was promptly
disqualified.
Tne race in particular was the second on
the card, a six-turlong selling affair.
Amelia was a 7 to 5 choice around post
time, and getting away first led to the
paddock, where she was oulgamed and
| beaten oat handily by Montallade. which
horse was backed from 12 down to 8.
After delaying the start by his vainless
endeavors to kick big boles in the atmos
phere Outlay, the 2 to 1 favorite in the
two-year-old event, finally beat the barrier
and downed the field of fourteen with
ease, romping the four and a half furlongs
in 58 seconds. In a drive Los Prietos, the
second choice, took the place from Miss
i R^mse**.
Dan Honig's mare, Lizzie H, was the
one picked to win the race following, also
at six furlongs, tbe money sending her
out a3to 2 favorite. Thorpe handled her
like a novice, and she failed to finish
among the first flight. Chenille, once as
good., as 10 to 1 in the betting, took toe
affair in .a hard drive from Pat Mun-hy,
against which 15 to 1 was laid. Man
chester, another 15 to 1 outsider, was
third.
Tne hurdle pantomime resulted in a
victory for Tuxedo, an 8 or .10 â¢ to
1 snot, which won driving from the
tavorite Arundel. These races which have
deteriorated to the level of a bunco game
will soon become obsolete, for they now
fail to attract much interest. .The "lob
ster" horse Herman was again among the
"also rans." â  .. - â 
Waivable took his manufactured race
about the fifteenth this season â from four
grewsome looting platers. He was a 1 to
8 chance in the betting, and the race is not
entitled to description.
NOTES.
The El Rio Rey filly Swanhilda pulled
up lame after her race yesterday.
It is hinted about these days at the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1597.
The Finish of the California Derby Race at In 5 id: Track.
track that horses owned by certain owners
are changing hands without any money
consideration being in sight. This, how
ever, is no new feature of selling-race wars.
Cy Holly said after the second event
that he bad been waiting all season to
male, a mild "killine," and then when his
desire had been satiated the race is taken
away from his horse. Cy and all of his
friends barked Montallade heavily and
were naturally in anything but an amia
ble mood ever the decision. Mai tin's
trick was not new here, but in the past it
always failed to go through unless the
"house" was down on the beaten horse.
The decision was certainly very far fetched,
and if California owners are not the re
cipients of more consideration at Ingle
side the local association will soon be able
to advertise "Eastern racing by Eastern
- horses," with perfect impunity.
After the different acrobatic, corkscrew
somersaults in the jumping horse busi
ness of late, it seems strange that- Mar
: tinus, tbe cleverest of all the steeplechase
riders assembled here, should have to re
main on the ground so long for getting
beate.i out in a drive on a 40 to 1 shot.
What a powerful "knock" must have
been' registered against him by the
"steeplechase ruler.'' Martinus .was un
fortunate to begin with in being a Cali
fornia rider, and on one occasion it is said
failed to carry out his Middle Western
orders.
Jockey Dtiffev now sect's reinstatement.
The lad wishes to ride in Montana the
coming season, and as bis exhibition on
Arno did not leave the brain in nearly as
muddled a state as the one put up by
"Jockey Bill" Martin on David Friday,
and which, by the way, came in for no
official censure, his request might be read
ily granted.
Tne victory of Scarborough was a very
popular one. and both Tommy Lottridge
and Jack Atkins, the colt's owners, were
kept busy lor several minutes shaking
hands and receiving the congratulations
or their friends. They won several thou
sand dollars over the colt's victory. A
strange part of the race is that" both
the winner and Scarf Pin are trained
by Mr. Lottridge, who bas shown himself
to be a conditioner of horses without a
peer in this section of the country. The
young horsemen have not been favored
with coquettish Dame Fortune's sweetest
smiles during the .present season and the
colt's win was like a burst of sunshine
from a cloudy sky. â  *
Manchester ran "a; muchly improved
race yesterday, which perhaps his owner
could explain. Outsiders' would .ay the
price was too short on Friday.
TO FLY LONG DISTANCES
Pigeons to. Travel Several Hun
dred Miles for a Cash
Priz?.
There was a large attendance at the
me etingof the California Pigeon and Hom
ing Society at the cm brooms, 632 Market
street, last evening. Several matters of
particular importance were discussed and
disposed of, the. principal one being the
rilling of the entries of the Santa Ro3a
races that will take place on May 31.
Connected with this race of fast-flying
birds is a little Incident worthy of explan
ation. This race is for the, Kuehn trophy.
. Otto L. Kuehn of Milwaukee, last year
presented the San Francisco Club with
twelve birds. These were auctioned
off and brought a goodly sum of money.
Last evening Messrs. Welch and Benjamin
were appointed as a committee to expend
this money for a beautiful trophy to bear
the name of the generous Milwaukee
donor, and it is for this prize .that the
race is to be held on the last of next month.
The foilowing.are the entries for the
first Kuehn race irom Santa Rosa on May
31 : Otto Brewitt of Alameda, 10 birds;
John Filmer of San Francisco, 10 birds;
H. F. Whitman of Alameda. 10 birds;
John Mole of Oakland, 7 birds; C. H.
Jewitt of San Fraucisco, 2 birds; T. W.
Leydecker of Alameda, 6 birds; G. T.
Marsh of San Francisco, 10 birds; John
Lennon of Colma station, 1 bird; J. W.
Welch of Ban Francisco, 10 birds. .
Tne members of the society have deter
mined to enter the held for long-distance
record flights and the first move was made
last evening." It was decided to offer $20
for tbe bird, : old :or â¢ young, making the
longest distance in the present year. The
conditions were that up to and including
500 miles the race secretary will place a
minimum. number of yards per hour that
the birds must fly. For distances over .500
miles a certain number of days will be
allowed. It is probable that all will enter
this competition for a record and for the
prize. ..7- = '..''"'. 7*. ; : ;-7 -*. --'-"',_ â .'":â â -. -"-
It was decided to make a test case of
the new law recently enacted by the State
Legislature which makes it a crime for
anyone to kill, wound or detain a hom
ing pigeon in its flight.
; A proposition : was received " from - 1 the
American Federation of Homing Pigeon ;
Associations Joir Newark, N. J., lor . the :
local society to join- the federation and
adopt the new timing machine. It is
likely that the whole proposition will
be accepted.
. John Luben of Alameda, H. K. Piatt of
San Jose and G. G. Gould of 2901 Jackson
street, San Francisco, were elected as
members.
Tbe society is likely to change its club
rooms before long.

HUNGER IS THREATENED.
The Appropriation for Branch
Jail 3 Has . Run Very .
:; ..... .'. Low- , ' /:'.'/'
Supervisor Delaney Is Investigating
and the Contractor Is
,i .'.-; Obdurate.
The annual famine because of depleted
funds and an obdurate contractor is im
pending at Branch Jail No. 3. which is
presided over By Captain Ciarkson. Every
year the same thing occurs, and when
about three , months of the fiscal -. year re
main, the appropriation gets into bad
fix, the Pacinc Marine Supply Company
shuts down, there is a "roar" from the
jail that the prisoners are . starving, and
then tbe Supervisors scurry around' to
avoid such a contingency.
* Auditor Broderick recently noticed that
the Branch 3 apportionment of funds. was
running low, and when a big batch of de
mands that would -have left the fund
badly overdrawn- bad they oeen paid
came in be refused to audit them.
- The contractor tried to argue the point,
but Mr. Broderick pulled the law on bim
and politely declined- to audit any more
demands until the condition of the fund
warranted it. Supplies were running icw
at the jail, but the Supply Company would
Bend no more, and then Supervisor De
lancy, chairman of the Health and Police
Committee of the Board .of Supervisors,
was notified. He visited the jail, found
an empty "pantry,: and then called on
Auditor Broderick to see what could be
done. -
The two officials looked over the figures
together, and' it was found that there is
$1637 97 available for bills contracted prior
to . April 1 and that there are demands
against this already passed b * ' the Board
of- fen per vigors amounting to $3576 61, of
which $039 15 is for supplies, etc., and
$1537 46 for salaries.
The aggregate amount of .the bills still
in the hands of the board is not known,
but they wilt certainly put the funds in
still worse condition. There is still a sum
of about $8000 to tbe credit of Branch.Jail
2 which is available, and it is probable
that the board will make a transfer of thi-,
as bas been done before, and relieve the
famine.
It is said that Supervisor Delany is dis
satisfied with the amount of money that
has been spent for "extras," and that
Captain Clark-son's table may suffer some
what from the investigation that is on.

HUNG BY HIS SUSPENDERS.
A Drunkard Who Cannot Reform Tries
to Hie in a Cell. â  \ Â« . â 'â 'â 
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3. â Harry
Olsen, a laboring man, tried to hang him
seif in the City Prison early this morning
by suspending himself with his suspend
ers. Last Thursday Oisen' Whs arrested
for drunkenness and sentenced to three
days. Prior to that time he had sworn all
kinds of oaths to keep sober, but found
that the desire for drink was stronger
tban hi- will power.
, When he sonered ud he felt so blue that
Ihe decided to commit suicide. He first
started to carry out his threat against
himself by butting his head against the
b**rs, but one butt convinced him that
such a method was not only unaigoified,
but fatal, so he discarded it. O.sen took \
his leather suspenders, which are very
strong, and tied them high up on a bar.
He then made a noose, which he put over
his head and raised his feet from the
eround. The gurgling noise coming from
bis throat attracted the attention of the
trusty and Oisen was cut down before be
became unconscious. He declared after
ward that a man who could not keep
sober had better die, but qualified this by
saying that before he died he intended to
make another attempt to keep sober.
BEATEN INTO- INSANITY.
Peculiar Result of a Kow In a San Pablo-
Avenue Saloon. "'.---'-â  'i'
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3. âW. W.
Roper, a grainer, is in the county jail being
restrained at the request of his wife.
Roper had a difficulty about a week ago
with the proprietor and bartender of a
saloon on San Pablo avenue, and claims
that he was badly beaten. He still shows
the mar-s-of rough usage, and his wife
says that he cannot sleep and is greatly
worried and excited at times, and she at
tritnites it to the beating. If he does not
speedily improve he may be examined as
to his sanity and an action brought for
damages against his assailants.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 3. f
Many of the fashionable members of the
Brooklyn Presbyterian Church were in
Judge Greene's court to-day listening to
the trial of several of their leading mem
bers for the alleged defamation â¢of the
character of Henry B. Van Patten,* for
which he asks $25,000 damages?
The case i .as created considerable atten
tion during the past six months on ac
count of the prominence of the defend
ants, who are Mrs. Priscilla Thomas, Mrs.
Trial of Prominent Church Folks in a Suit for Damages Arising Out of the Protection of Two
Little Innocent Girls.
E. Wolfden, C. J. Welch, J. H. Thomas,
Frank Ash, Mrs. Frank Ash and George
P. Lowell. Key. S. S. Palmer, although
interested in the case, is not a defendant.
He was in court all day-
Some time ago tbe ladies of the Presby
terian church took in hand to rectify some
very grievous errors- in the Van Patten
family. That such errors existed was
proved by the testimony in the trial of
one James L. Tyson, who was convicted
and sent to jail for a simple assault on one
of Van Patten's little daughters.
i-. In May, 1895, Van Patten and Tyson
were arrested and taken to the County
Jail. The Van Pattens then lived on Six
teenth street and Tenth avenue in East
Oakland. The charge was made that Van
Patten had countenanced the presence in
his home oi Tyson, with a full knowledge
of the fact that Tyson's intentions toward
the Van Patten girls were not i onoraole.
The members of the church took up the
matter and warrants were sworn to by 0.
J. Welch. ' Van Patten was tried before
Justice Lawrence in East Oakland. He
.erved" eleven days in jail pending the ex
amination.- Tyson was held for trial, but
the felony charge was notsubstantiated in
the Superior Court, and he was sentenced
to three months for a simple assault.
P In his complaint asking for $25,000 for
libel. Van Patten states that the defend
ants have broken up his home; that their
allegations hays- caused his two children
to be taken from him, and that be is now
refused permission' to visit them. He as
serts that the defendants had no grounds
fur making tbe allegations, and ; declares
that what was done was part of a conspir
acy to ruin him. â¢ '- 'â 'â  "''
The ladies of the Brooklyn church and
the other defendants staled definitely that
the arrest was prompted solely' by mo
tives of humanity and to shield two little
girls from the evils of gross companion
ship. . ' "â â¢â *.
Harry A. Melvin and Attorney . Haven
represent the defendants, and Attorney
Aram appear* for Van Patten. The select
lobby listened nearly all day to argu
ments relative to the admission of the
complaint issued ' by the Justice of the
Peace in the original proceedings. Attor
ney Aram read the complaint, and much
of- it is expressed in i definite language
other than that usually found in such
documents as being -"of information and
belief." He argued that the complaint
was admissib'e as evidence of a conspiracy
against Van Patten."
The defendants' attorneys argued the
question for several hours. Finally Judge
Greene consented to a postponement of
two week_s.fSgffilÃ||B^MÃNSÃ^V_HÃ"Hi
. The case has been dragging along for
some time,' but ha* not been brought to
trial because of the inability of the plaintiff
to put up the costs. This morning Van
Patten's attorney produced the necessary
lees ana the case went on. .

without avail, and she soon left Dim and
took tne furniture with her. Some time
later he discovered that, she was living
with another man at Fruitvale, and he
then started divorce proceedings. -â ' -:.
Judge Ellsworth asked bim the name of
the other man, but Kelley refused to
divulge it, claiming that he wanted to
protect himself. Kelley's silence is under
stood to be caused by the fact that the
guilty man in the ca is another railroad
offic. al who might imperil Kelley's job,
which he values now more than his wife**
affection. BN@BS-_SH-BbK
Uniier the circumstances, the Judge gave
Kelley one week to produce further
testimony.

This notice apneared in to-night's local

for some of the grievances that he imag
ined existed between himself and wife, he
made an attempt to have some of her chil

Cahiil even went so far as to visit Mrs.
Prescott, secretary of the Society for Pre-;

her some peculiar stories about bis wile.
Mrs. Prescott commenced an investiga

her husband's doings she at once started
out to right herself beiore the public. She
denied all the stories and was able, to
prove thai the wrongs referred to by Ca

with, this, she found her husband and

ANXIOUS TO BE
DECLARED SANE
George Aldrich Wants to Be
the Custodian of His
Own Estate.
For Several Years He Has Been
Attending to Business in the
Usual Way.
The Heir Has Recently TraveleJ
Extensively and Doctors Declare
He Has Recovered.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
. 908 Broadway, April 3. )
George A. Aldrich, a son of the decease-
Oakland, banker, William Aldrich, is agdin
anxious to be restored to competency.
This afternoon his attorney, Wiliam Huff
Coot, appeared before Judge Hall and
asked that the matter be heard. /Â«
â Youne Aldrich was declared to be in
sane in thd courts of this county on May
24,1888. In his father's will provision is
made that a fourth of his estate, worth
over half a million dollars, should be held
in trust for the young man during his nat
ural life or until he should be restored to
capacity.
.rich now declares that' he. is per
fectly sane and capable of taking care of
himself and his property, and he is
anxious that the court vacate the order
declaring him insane and judicially de
clare that be is once more of sound and
disposing mind. Â«>
Aldrich is now 34 years of age, is not
married and has no guardian. For the
past two years he has been regarded by
his friends as entirely responsible, and he
is now anxious to be declared legally com
petent.
When the case was taken up it appeared
that the relatives of young Aldrich had
not been notified of the hearing, and
Judge Hall decided to continue the case
until Monday noon to -permit of Mrs.
Donning, a sister of Aldrich, who resides
in this cay, being notified. _.
About a year ago Aldrich, who had b-en
out of the asylum some lime on parole,
made a similar petition. After leaving
the asylum he traveled extensively in
this country and Canada and also took a
trip to the Hawaiian Islands. ."
-It was on his return from the latter
place that he asked to be restored to re
sponsibility. Judge Ogden conducted a
very exhaustive investigation, and sev
eral medical experts, including Dr. Gard
ner of â¢ Napa, testified. Their evidence
seemed to indicate that at the time the
young man was perfectly sane. The only,
question in doubt was as to the possible
recurrence of his mental delusion.
... Tbe case was temporarily i continued,
and in the meantime Judge O den re
ceived a communication from Aldrich and
had an interview with him, which resulted
in tbe court dismissing the application at
that time. Since then Aldrich has con
tinued', bis travels and it is said he has
conducted his business and deported him
self as any one would do in his rig.it mind.
The bringing of the "petition at this
time evidently had some connection with
the suit brought by William Holt Aldrich
in- San. Francisco a few days ago to set
aside a i rust provision in favor of himself
and his children. The trust is claimed to
be void in. that it prohibits the a ienation
of the interest of the son and heir until a
child not yet born shall be 24 years of age.
It is more than likely that George Aldrich
is wanted' as a witness. m this case, and
that ne wishes to be restored to capacity
so that . he will be competent to testify.
William Aldrich was a well-known char
acter m the Hawaiian Islands, and is now
a resident of i San Francisco. - "-.'.

Surpassed by Berkeley Men.
BERKELEY, Cal., April The rec
ords made at the oni- Cambridge field
day yesterday are betas discu-sed with
much enthusiasm by the students' at
Berkeley. A comparison of the results
with the performance of California men
shows that the records made in a major
ity of the events do not equal, much less
surpass, those established at the State
University:
The two English universities were tied at
10 1-5 in the 100-yard dash. California's
record, established by Seoggina, is 10 seconds.
In the 16-pound shot put Oxiord won yester
day by making 37 feet ii}<, inches. The record
of EJgren.is 40 ieet G Indies.
Iv the 120-yard hurdle race the blue-and
gold men Â»re considerably ahead of the Brit
i*ners, Oxford having won at IG 3-5, while the
Berkeley record, made by Dyer, is 15 3-5 sec
onds.
The high jump is another event in which
the IJ. C. record is far ahead of tnat made yes
lerday in the English meet. C-wbridge and
Oxford tied at 5 :eet 7 inches. The record of
Patterson of Berkeley is 5 feet \\__ inches.
The IG-pound nammer throw was won by
Cambridge -et 07 ieet Oa inches. Ecgrou's
record for California is 137 feel 10 incites, and
there are several others who can surpass it.
In the mile run, 440-yard run and broad
iuinp the English!"-.- made better records
than those of Berkeley. A Cambridge man
lid the mile in 4:27 2-5. Berkeley's lowest
record is 4:38.2-5. by Brown. The 440-yard
lash was done iv 49 4-5 seconds, by Oxtord.
fn this event Berkeley's record, made by
Mays, is 51"^. The broad jump Oxiord won by

He went to the city strictly "incognito
and, after inquiring prices, found a lot of
supplies which were offered to bim as a
private individual at about 40 per cent less
than the price agreed. on by the combina

supplies at the reduced rate the ' dealers
were keeping a strict watch for one "Clerk
Harbourne" of Alameia, who they had
been told was in the market for supplies
and for whose' benefit the prices were to
be raised. But they had tbe name wrong,
and it was not until the bargain had been

NEW TO-DAY
NERVOUS PEOPLE.
The Proof Is Positive, if Your Neighbor's Testimony Is
Beyond Doubt, That Hundreds of Supposed Incurable
Cases Have Been Cured by the State Electro-Med- \
ical Institute No Matter What Your Trouble,
the Eminent Specialists Who Are Carrying
on This Beneficent Work Will Examine
You, Give an Honest Opinion of > ;
Your Case, and Tell You
Whether You Can Be Cured.
The loss of Nerve Power is daily becoming the most common affliction of the
human race. It is the one great cause for so much sickness in the land to-day. A
diseased or disordered nervous system soon creates a disturbance of all the bodily
functions and lays the foundation for constitutional diseases.
It is no longer an open question re_ardiim the cures made by the. Electro-Medical
treatment of all cases of Nervous Debility, Sleeplessness, Impoverished Blood, Neu-
ralgia. Rheumatism, Impaired Vigor and all conditions arising from a debilitated
nervous system.
At this season of the year especially you need a remedy for impure blood and a
tonic for your nerves, because your system is run down in vitality and vigor. The
Electro-Medical treatment brings n w life to the worn, fagged, nerveless, emaciated
sufferer. ; It imparts new energy, makes joa feel the fire of youth again, makes work
a pleasure, makes you capable of enjoying to the utmost every enjoyable thing. It
produces a permanent increase of vital activity in" the system, and by its electric
energy excites the parts to more vigorous exertion, thus giving them the power to
throw off and everlastingly eradicate disease.

MORGAN
IS IN TOWN
The Accused Attorney Was
Seen on Market
Street.
FULLY IDENTIFIED BY
TWO PERSONS.
How He Tried to Swindle In
ventor Bodeman Out of a
Car Patent.
HIS CHECKERED CAREER AT
KIKGSBURG.
j
It Is Now Be.iev.d That He Is Await- j
ing an Opportunity to Leave
the City.
All doubts as to .the whereabouts of E.
If. Morgan, the attorney who disappeared I
several days aso alter being accused of
blackmailing and defrauding clients and
acquaintances in all directions, were set
at rest yesterday morning by bis appear- ]
ance on Market street. â¢
Since his departure from his office and :
home rumor has located him in half a
dozen different places. Some people were
sure he had gone East, others had heard
the fugitive was in Southern California,
and not a few felt certain that he had
sailed for Australia or some other foreign
shore.
On Friday a dispatch was received from
Ukiah that he had been discovered at
Ort's Springs, fourteen miles from Ukiah,
living on the ranch of Jud McClellan
under the name of McXamara.
Morgan must have been greatly amused
at these rumors, for the supposition now
is that be has been in San Francisco all
the time, and that he is either waiting for
an opportunity to leave the. City for a safe
refuge from prosecution or until he can
prevail upon those lie nas injured not to
prosecute him.
Leo G. Ratio, who is the manager of a j
collection agency, saw Morgan on Market j
sireet opposite the Spreckels Market yes
terday morning and was about to hail
him with "Hello, Morgan, where have
you been?" when the attorney suddenly
crossed the street and made his way
toward Fourth street.
Mr. Rattn has had business dealings (
with Morgan and knows him well, so that I
there can be no mistake about the identi- j
fication.
Later E.W. Williams, clerk of the Justice
Court, also saw Morgan on Market street,
but he was some distance away and sud
denly disappeared. Mr. Williams has
seen the attorney about the Justice
clerk's office on numerous occasions and
is quite sure that the man he saw was
none other than the missing lawyer.
It is believed that he has been hiding in
some obscure lodging-house waiting for a
favorable opportunity to decamp.
Another Morgan story has just come to
light.
A man who says Morgan tried to de-
! fraud him is Henry Bodeman. He is an
inventor, and lives at 5*21 Twenty-seventh
street. The case in question concerns a
car-fender which Bodeman invented and I
gave into the attorney's hands to have i
patented.
Bodeman produces telegrams and other j
documents in corroboration of his siory.
In addition he is known to be a man ot I
honest, upright character, whose word is j
as good as his oath.
From 1877 till 1882 he served in the
United States cavalry ,-and was engaged in i
many battles with Indians in the North- I
west. His order of discharge was signed j
by Colonel G. __. Burton, now inspector- j
general of the United States army, at pres- |
ent in this City. His certificate of character |
attached to the order is signed by First
Lieutenant George B. Backus, and testi
fies that he is "an honest, reliable man, a
good soldier and an excellent mechanic."
Bodeman's story, told in his own lan
guage, is as follows:
"I invented my car- fender in January,
1896. The superintendent of one of the
local street railway, has told me that it is
the very best contrivance of the kind in I
existence.
"Dr. Melville H. Logan, a friend of
mine, took m* to Attorney Morgan some i
time in June of the same year, telling me
that he believed him to be a good patent
attorney. I did so, and have been sorry
ever since. When Dr. Logan saw how
things were going he was sorry also.
"Morgan kept things dragging along
until March Bof the present year. Then
he informed me that the patent had been
allowed and demanded his last fee.
"I got suspicious and telegraphed the
Commissioner of Patents' at Washington,
inquiring if my patent had really been al
lowed. . George L. Morton, the chief clerk
of the Patent Office, replied that they
could identify no patent in my name.
"Then 1 went to see Police Judge Low

showed him the telegraphic answer, and
said 1 wanted to get a warrant out for
Morgan's arrest. Judge Low said he be
lieved Morgan .to, be an honorable man
and there must be some mistake. Then I
went to the warrant clerk, and he refused
point blank to give me wnat 1 desired.
"Thinking that Morgan might send the
patent papers which be had In his pos
session to the Commissioner at Washing
ton to save himself in the matter, I went
â  down to see the -Postmaster, Mr. Doyle,
| and found. that be had deposited a regis
; tered package there.
"Mr. Doyle kindly stopped the package
| from being sent, pending an answer to
I my telegram to Washington to be permit-
I ted to open the package. The Commis
; sioner replied that be couid not erant the
I request on the insufficient evidence fur
| nished, but would inspect the I : aekage as
soon as it was received at his office. Com-
I missioner John S. Dymau himself signed
j this. ,
"Then I went to the rffire of Morgan
I and compelled bis brother,' W. Morgan, to
I go with me to the Postmaster and exam
ime the package. As I thought, Morgan
i had mailed the drawings, but they were
covered with ink spots and looked as if
they had been tampered with. Then we
let them go on to Washington.
"Altogether. I have paid Mr. Morgan
$55 in patent fees. Tne lirst fee of the
Government in a case of this kind is $15.
If Morgan acted squarely with the Gov
ernment he pocketed. the balance; other
wise he has pocketed the whole and sent
not a cent to Washington.
"By Monday or Tuesday at the latest I
shall know whetner this is true or not. I
bel eve that there are infringements on
my patent now, owing to this man's
peculiar action.
"In all probability Morgan has patented
the inveniion in his own name or has got
some- one else to do it. I shall know toon
anyway, and I am going to make things
warm for somebody if it is true."
Dr. Ligan slates that it was the per
sistent manner in which Bodeman fol
lowed Morgan up afier discovering his
treachery that led to the attorney's flight.
Circumstances, he believes, were such
that Morgan would have had to flue any
way in a short time, but Bodeman made
him "get a move on."
HIS SUCCESSFUL HAMLET
Otis Skinner's Auiienc. Com
pels Him to Make a
â¢Speech.
"La Juiv." Is R.p.-ated at the Cali
forniaâPrinc pals' Fm
Work
* A very artistic and successful perform
ance of "Hamlet" was given by Otis
Skinner and his company at the Baldwin
Theater last night. When, in demand to
enthusiastic applause, the actor was
finally induced to make a speech, he mod
estly gave the audience most of the credit
for his success, faying t at the sympathy
of appreciative hearers often does more to
make a Hamlet than the actor's art.
Every detail of the performance showed
that tne production had been carefully
thought out by a student of Shakespeare.
To quote one instance as an example: On
the nrst entrance of the player." the P. ayer
Queen, whom Hamlet addresses as "young
lady," was a stripling, wearing doublet
and nose. This was historically correct,
for in Shakespeare's time all "young
lady" parts were played by youths.
The performance was -riven with
scarcely any cuts, and in consequence was
much more impressive than in the muti
lated form in which it is generally pre
sented.
i Skinner's impersonation of Hamlet was
extremely picturesque and romantic. In
the more impassioned scenes he rose to
powerful heights of passion, particularly
in the chamber scene, at the conclusion of
which he was recalled frequently.
Maud Durkin was an ideal Ophelia, both
in appearance and acting. Her youth,
and ncr flexible, picturesque appearance,
made her charming to the eye, and the
girlish. tenderness and naivete of her
acting won her the hearty sympathy of
the audience.
Among tbe rest of the ' long cast, W. J.
Constamine's Polonius is especially
worthy of mention. In consequence of its
success, â¢â¢Hamlet" will be repeated next
Thursday.
At the California Theater last
night "La Juive" was repeated, with
the cast wnich so successfully per
iorraed tne work at the matinee
two weeks ago. The performanc. is one
of the finest in the repertoire of the com
pany. Prevost repeated his success as the
persecuted .Jew,, who revenges himself
on his enemy by stealing Inn daughter.
Mme. Foedor sang with splendid
dramatic effect in the title role, and Mme.
Berthet and Ed Deo contributed to the
success of the evening. Atlu-s sang' the
Cardinal and did good work in some of
the fcenes, but occasionally, particularly
in the malediction scene, his intonation
was not beyond reproach. The orchestra,
conducted by ii. Nicosia did good work,
but tbe choruses might have been stronger!
To-morrow "William Tell" will be the
bill. .

CUT LOOSE
FROM THE
LEAGUE
Local Wheelmen Make
History for Their Own
Interests.
RESENTED THEIR UN
JUST TREATMENT.
The California Asscc : at?d Cycling
Clubs Will Hereafter Manage
Track Races.
SUNDAY RACING WILL BE
ALLOWED.
Professionals Will Now Hava an
Objectionable Stigma Removed
F.om Them.
The refusal of the League of Ameri
can heel men to recognize tbe demands
of the California division has borne its
fruit.
At a meeting of the Associated Cycline
Clubs, held at the rooms of the Imperial
Cycling Club last evening, the former or
ganization finally determined to lake ex
clusive control' of both track and road
races in this State, and in such other terri
tory as they may be invited to assume
jurisdiction over.
This means nothing less than the sup
planting by the local association of the
national organization, which has hitherto
held undisputed sway over track events
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
is looked upon by wheelmen oi this end of
the State, at any rate, as pre-eminently
the organization to usurp the functions of
ihe league if there is to be an usurpa
tion.
It is said to be the most successful or
ganization of clubs in the United States,
and the success with which it has con
ducted the road races augurs well for the
more extensive operations which it is now
about to engage iii.
At the meeting last night the following
clubs were represented:
Acme Club Wheelmen, Alameda Cy
clers, Bay City Wheelmen, California Cy
cling Club/Capital City Wheelmen, East
I Oakland Wheelmen, Garden City Cyc.ers,
Golden Gate Cycling Club, Imperial Cy
cling Clnb, Mountain View Cyclers,
Olympic Club Wheelmen, Pathfinder Bi
cycie Club, Reliance Wheelmen and San
Fraucisco Road Club.
A. P. Swain, president, was in the chair
and J. F. Hancock acted as secretary.
The preliminary business of the meet
ing was rapidly disposed of. The finan
cial report oi the secretary-treasurer was
read, showing a balance of $107 05 on
hand. The report of the road-iaciug and
records committee was reviewed in which
the events held under the auspices of the I
association during the last two months
were favorably reviewed. The Barker Cy
cling Club was admitted to membership
and the resignation of the Diamond Cy
cling Club was received.
Charles Albert Adams, chairman of the
committee appointed at a previous meet
ing to draft a new constitution and set of
by-laws, was then called upon to report,
and this ushered in the important business,
of the ' evening. There was a manifest
spirit if harmony in all the proceedings
relating to the secession movement, and
the constitution which Mr. Adams pro
posed, with a few technical alterations,
met with the entire approval of the dele
gates. It was unanimously adopted, seri
atim.
The pan of organization contemplated
by the new constitution is radically dif
ferent from that heretofore maintained by
the association, as it involves a provision
for individual membership similar to that
enjoyed by members of the league. The
racing rules of the reorganized association
are mainly similar to those of the
league, with the important exceptions
that there is nothing to prevent
Sunday racing, professional racing
men are not barred from membership,
amateurs are allowed to race more than
200 miles from their homes without a spe
cial permit, and clubs are permitted to
pay the actual expenses of riders who are i
contesting for a club trophy. Tne mem
bership fee was placed at $1.
The membership roll was opened im
mediately, and after half a dozen mem
bers had signed officers were elected as
follows:
A. P. Swain, president; Stanley G.
Scovern, secretary; J. F. Hancock, trea
surer. Robert M. Welch was appointed
chairman of the racing committee and
Frank H. Kerrigan chairman of the iocal
organization committee.
A special meeting of the board of con
trol of the association will beheld next
Saturday evening at the Olympic/ Club
rooms.
TO RELIEVE THE L. A. X
There Is a Movement Will Under Way
for the Formation of a New Bicycle
Organization.
CHICAGO. 111.. April 3.â The Tribune
this morning prints the following: A
movement is well under way for the for
mation of a body of wheelmen to take
charge of cycle racing and ; relieve the
L. A. W. of that responsibility.
From the States which have been in
dignant at the treatment accorded them
at the general meeting of the league at
Albany have come reports favorable to a
divorce of racing irom the, league, and
leaders have been found willing to under
take the work.
California, Louisiana, Texas, Minne
sota, Kentucky, Ohio and Missouri are nil
ready for the new venture. ,â¢ George K.
Barrett has been, in correspondence re
garding the Plan," and 'yesterday received
a letter from E. H. Croninger, Southern
member of the racing board, approving
the plans which Mr. Barrett is consider
ing. â¢â ' r 'â¢'.-" -:,:.::'
The first decided step in the movement
will be the calling of a convention at a
centrally located city to consider the plans
and ascertain how, much support outside
of the known States can. be secured.- Or
ganization will be .perfected and the new
league or ; association will begin 'â â  its con
trol of cycle racing and will give Sunday
races., â .â â .: ,â¢'..'â '
Cincinnati has been a supporter of the
scheme, and; the wheelmen there are
ready for the change, it is* said, and Ches
ter Park . track, one . of â¢; the r finest >in the
country,- will be under the jurisdiction of
the new body.
r St. Louis cyclist* aro also counted upon
as a strong factor of the formation of the
body, and . Sunday racing, it ' is . thought,
will be a popular feature there.
1 The track-owners ol the "country are
ready to quit tbe league' rule : and go over
to Sunday racing, and i the new organiza
tion is counting upon them for support. '.'.'
The L. A. W. may oppose ihe scheme,
but it is not the intention to antagonize
the league if it can be helped.
' PAEMEES' CLUB.
Professor Carl C. Plehn to' Address the
HnnÃ rat" -lectin^.
The first general meeting of the Farm
ers' Club will be held this evening at the
Mechanics* Institute, 31 Post street. j
On this occasion"* Professor Carl .C.
Piebn of the State University will address
the club on "How the California Farmers
are Overtaxed." The committee on or- (
ganization appointed at the recent San
Francisco Farmers' Institute will also re
port. rjflTO
The objects of the club, as stated in the
constitution, are "the promotion of the
interests of agriculture In California by
the collection and diffusion of informa
tion and such other means as the by-laws
may pre.-enbe, or as the cluo itself may
determine from time to time." The dues
ore $3 per annum, payable in semi-annual
ailments.
It is proposed to open an office, furnish
it with convenient reference books and
commei:c- at once tne collection of . a
working library of husbandry. for the u?e
of inemuersanrt per.-ons wishing to pur
sue any special line of investigation in
agriculture, dairying, etc. It is thought
that a large number of valuable books
published by the United States and State
governments and by colleces of agricul
ture can be had for the asking, and which
will be exceedingly valuable when brought
together and conveniently classified.
The club is an outgrowth of the recent
farmers' Institute held in San Francisco
under the auspices of the University of
California, and will have the indorsement
and aid of the College of Agriculture of
the State University. It i-< proposed to
undertake the systematic study of some
of the many problems vitally affecting the
farming interests of California and to ar
range for subsequent farmers' institutes
where these problems can be publicly dis
cussed, and to employ such other means
as the club may deem expedient from
time to time for making its thinking most
effective and its resources most useful to
our agricultural interests.
The yeailv work of the club will be un
der the direction of its oflicers, including
a board of live directors. The following
compos the committee: Ernst A. Den
ies, Edward F. Admits, Alfred Holman,
I'hilo D. Jewett, B. P. Flint, H. H. Tay
lor, P. B. Cornwall.
GEEMAN OPEEA SEASON.
Meeting to Raise a Guarantee Fund to
Be Called Soon. '
The success that has attended the
French Opera Company has instilled into
the minds of several prominent German
citizens a desire to have at an early date
a season of German opera.
About ten years ago a German company
played a season here, producing several of
the leading operas, and its efforts were
crowned with marked success, and it ls
felt tbat another attempt would prove
equally successful.
No definite action has as yet been
taken, but some of tnose who have been
talking over the matter will call a meet
ing at an early date of those favorable to
the project, with the object of seeing if a
sufficient guarantee fund can be raised. It
is expected that no difficulty will be ex
perienced in that direction.

The Veterans to Erect a
Monument to Lincoln's
Memory.
Golden Gate Park Will Prob

in the Fab ie Schools
The California branch of the Lincoln
Monument National League was organ
ized March 20 of this year in Native Sons'
Hall in this City by a delegation from the
San Francisco Grand Army posts and
Camo Fair O.iks, Sons of Veterans. The
object of the league is to raise funds by
popular suDscription for a monument to
be erected in Golden Gate Park to the
memory of Abraham Lincoln. There is
no such monument on this coast.
, It was decided that any one may join
the leap'tn by paying 25 cents into the
lund. E.ch -subscriber will.be given a
copyrighted badge with a certificate of
membership. '.-..'â  . ;â¢'. â './â .'.'â '
The league was organized by the elec
tion of the following- named officers: W.
W. Stone, president; W. B. Hooper, vice
president; S. Cahen, vice-president; C.
Mason Rhine, treasurer; Eugene Wie
gand, quartermaster-general; F. J. Peck,
secretary.
The following were appointed chairmen
of the standing committees: Ways and
means, Joseph Steele; schools and
churchei*, Elisha Brooks; printing, W. F.
Howe; judiciary, .H. C. Dibble; corre
spondence, A. J. Vining; press, T. C.
Masteller; auditing, Peter H. Maas;

Gordon; information, W. C. Guirey ; or
ganization, J. J. Lyons; finance, General
Samuel W. Backus; advisory ooard, Hon.
JamesD. Pbeian (Mayorof San Francisco).
It is proposed to raise a fund of $10., 000
or more, so that there may be erected in
the most beautiful park in the country a
manument worthy of the man and of the
cause represented by him.
The executive board has taken steps to
inaugurate a Lincoln day in the public
sc â¢ools, and school authorities through
i out the whole country will be requested to
set aside Friday, May 28, of this year as
Lincoln's day. The San Francisco Board
of Education has acceded to the request
of the veterans in this matter. On that
day veterans all over the country will be
detailed to visit the schools and talk his
tory from the viewpoint of eyewitnesses.
The counties of Marin, Santa Clara, San
Joaquin and Alameda have signified their
assent in addition to the principal cities
in the East. On that day a suitable pro
gramme will be laid out, consisting of the
recitation of the Gettysburg address, read
ing from extracts from the inaugural ad
dress, with remarks .by teachers and vis
itors, and' songs appropriate' to the occa
sion. '. . r
Dying """"oin I'oison. ." I
A , poorly dressed, middle-aged man went
into 521 Pacific street yesterday afternoon and
soou became unconscious. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital and every effort made
to restore him to consciousness without suc
cess. A bottle marked "ammonia" was found
in his pocket. There was nothing that would
lead to his identification.
Trinity M. K. Church Services.
A truly remarkable revival has been in
progress for three weeks in the Trinity Metho
dist Church 111 this City. Fully a hundred
have been at the altar. Rev. G. H. Jones ot
Oakland and Rev. R. S. Marshall, the evangel
ist, have assisted the pastor. Rev. Dr. Jewell.

afix iumi. i ttUpt-o-* â  ru* " a6Â»_. *^AN OAKLAND SCIENTIST
DISPUTES SIR ISAAC NEWTON.
IWf>K. H * D * HOUGHAN of Oakland
thinks tbat he has discovered the
g . -inks that he has discovered tbe j
AJ\-1$ mechanical "why" for gravitation ;
the "why" whose existence Sir Isaac New
ton conceded and at the same time con
fessed that he could not find it.
Mr. Houghan has been working over the
problem for forty years, and he now be
lieves that he Bas solved it and that suc
cess! has finally crowned his labors.
Tbe scientist was visited in his home
across the oay by a Sunday Call reporter,
to whom he talked most interestingly con- j
cerning his supposed discovery of a new j
principle in mechanical science.
"After forty years of experimenting and j
study," said Mr. Houghan, "I claim to <
have discovered the mechanical and ,
mathematical principles in which elec- i
tricity, heat* and other forces of matter, |
both materialized and etherealized, operate
to produce many of the phenomena that |
v*e see in nature as we call it. but as I be- i
lieve there is an economic value in my
discovery I can only give you some of the
cardinal point- leading up to it at present.
"When Newton picked out the Latin
words, 'centrum peto and centrum fugo,'
out of which he coined the two English
words centripetal and centrifugal and ap
plied them as names to the two motions
or force* which he claimed to have dis
covered and explained that always exist
in a body revolving on an axis, he as
sumed at once that our earth was endowed I
* with the same condition of force and mo
tion, and as he found that the centrifugal
force was from the center at a right angle
from a racia of that center, be found that
force not to be in harmony with world- j
. building and then claimed to have dis- j
covered what he called the law of gravi- j
tation to counteract his other foree â
that is, a law that clothes matter with !
the powerof acting at a distance, although j
he admitted that he believed that there
was a mechanical 'why' for gravitation,
but he could not find it and only claimed j
the credit of discovering the mathematical
'why.' The mechanical 'why' is what I
-claim to have discovered, and I do not
claim it as a theory alone.
"I would not give a fig for any man's
theory or a cent for my own if I had one
if I did not have something tangible be
hind it. I claim in describing it I can
materially demonstrate, mechanically
illustrate and mathematically prove it.
It I should go into my mill to put in
some additional machinery and 1 should j
find that some of the old pulleys were
running the wrong way to suit the new j
pulleys, what would I do? Reverse the
engine and shafting? By no means. I
would cross the belt and the new pulley !
would run the right way. Now, that is j
just what nature does. She crosses her
belts. But one may say that there is no I
such thing as a visible tangible Deit in the !
nebular hypothesis. I grant it; but what
is the operation of a visible tangible
belt? Nothing but force operating
upon the Ini.s of least resistance
AN INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT KRUGER AT HIS HOME AT PRETORIA
Jtp^p'l'yiTH the roar and thunder of ma
'J chiner at work in and around
iMiMj-l Johannesburg almost echoing
in one's ears, and still bearing with
one a vivid impression of the enter
prise and capacity everywhere in evi
dence there, it is almost startling to be
.suddenly transferred to the comparatively
village-like capital of the South African
Republic, distant only thirty-two miles by
road. The string of little iron boxes on
, wheels, which the Netherlands Railway
Company calls a train, is run np to the
platform of tbe neat but not striking build
ings of tbe railway station at Pretoria.
Outside the beloved bullock-wagons stand
or slowly creak along the road, which, at
the time ot my arrival, happened to be
..deep in mud and pools of water, due to
some heavy rainfalls. The hotel omnibus
rolled and swayed as it carried us down a
tree-bordered road, passing a good many
cheap villas in course of erection, and
then between some low veranda bed shops
and dwellings, above the ignoble roofs of
which there rose into view the mass of the
new Government buildings, of no archi
tectural merit, but of imposing dimensions,
surmounted by a figure said to represent
Liberty.
Tbe pretentious Government buildings
are curiously out of harmony with the
character of the town, though there are
several substantial building, in the vicin
ity. The square in front, where stands
the Reformed Dutch Churchâ an edifice
in plasterers' and carpenters' Gothicâ is
not paved or macadamized, and presents
an uneven muddy surface after rain, a
sample of tram veldt. There is one
street â Kerk s'rect â with some good shops
and stores, generally with English names,
* and, goods displayed with English descrip
tions, and I was struck by the amount of
English I "heard spok n there. The other
streets are but partially if at all con
structed, preserving a rural appearance
which sometimes affords pretty glimpses.
The departure of the President from the
Government buildings in the afternoon is
the occasion for a mild military dis
play. There are always policemen
armed with rifles doing "sentry go"
around the building, but when ; the
hour approaches for the President to
leave a little batch of mounted and armed
policemen is drawn up outside the rather
stunted portico which is stuck on to the
front of the building, where a brougham
driven by a man in livery is in attend
ance. As the . clock strikes the hour his
Honor makes his appearance from the en
trance attired in a tall hat and lons black
coat. As soon as he is seated ; the
, brougham starts, and the little Snot of at
tendant horsemen scatter suddenly around
the vehicle, where sits the President with
his chin resting on his chest and his
hands folded over the handle of his stick.
As I witnessed this little bit of ceremony
-for the first time it was easy to perceive
that time had left its mark on * the old
I within the form and substance of the
< belt, and that is what ' electricity
and all other forces in nature do; always
acton the lines of least resistance within
the form and substance of whatever they
are acting in, and toe forces in their op
erations in nature as we call it, cross
these lines of least resistance and the sci
entist bus never been able to explain their
â¢ mechanism. They point out the many
crossed lines in physical geogra
phy, and the crossing of the nerves as
| they pass from the spinal cord to the
| brain at the medulla oblongata, the motor
: optic and nearly all the nerves of the
I human and animal body on which flow
â  the nervous fluid, but they have never
j been able to explain the mathematical
| and mechanical operation of these sys
! terns of vibratory energy, and like our
i earth, the cyclone, waterspout, tbe shot
I falling from the shot-tower, hail, rain and
; many other systems of energy that seem j
a puzzle to them â that is what I claim to
be able to explain !
"The explanation carries with it no
puzzle or seeming inconsistencies, as there
is in some of Newton's theories. Take
one of his theories that space has three
dimensions, then just consider a body of
matter liKe our earth, 8000 miles through,
with all its mountain ranges and inequal
ities, with free access to this space revolv
ing upon but one axis, what is there to
! keep it from deviating or turning on some
| other axis, and if it should what is there
'. to stop it or bring it back? Within the
: last few years I have . read a number of
j pamphlets from different authors wherein
i they claim that there is the fourth dimen
j sion to space, and our failure to compre
i hend it is the cause of our ignorance of
t the mechanism of the universe.
"Now, 1 deny that there is any such
1 thing as dimension to space. What we
j call space is a condition between forms,
! and is not an entity, and has. no existence
: in fact, and you cannot give dimensions
to a non-existing nothing. What seems
to designate to us the condition we call
space is nothing but the principles that
govern the possibilities and impossibili
ties of the vibratory energy of the absolute
of the form, togsther with the joint prod
uct of that vibratory energy tjovernud by
ail the possibilities and impossibilities of
.the motion of the form itself.
"The reason why, as I claim, that there
is stability apparent in our planet, is that
i the motion that we see is the elusive mo
i tion of form, that is, the combined prod
] net of the invisible mathematical mechan
| ically organized systems of the vibratory
I energy of the absolute of matter or t..e
! mathematically arranged units of form.
"In a system that I can show is a spon
i taneity in nature wherein all the systems
so arranged themselves as in the snow
flake that the vibratory energy is con
stantly recurring back to itself or back to
first primary motion, so tnat when the
system is once created, like a waterspout
over the ocean, for instance, every system
j man, whom I had seen last in 1881, when |
I he was addressing tho Boer forces en- I
camped over Laing's Ncr, after the pre
liminaries of peace and the independence |
of the Transvaal had been arranged with !
the British. At that time Kruger was 'â 
playing second fiddle, General Joubert
being the man of the honr.
One afternoon I had the honor of call
, ing upon President Kruger, accompanied
jby Mr. Weinthal, editor of the official
j Press of Pretoria, who courteously offered !
Ito introduce me. Situated a few yards
back from the fence bordering the side
walk, the President's dwelling is a low
i built house of the ordinary South African
I type, shaded by tress and shrubs, growing |
| close up to the veranda. At the little !
i white gateposts lounged two policemen,
i booted, spurred, armed with magazine
j rifles and bandoliers, the uniform very
similar to that of the Cape Mounted Rifles.

of vibratory energy embodies within itself j
both cause and effect, for the kinetic en- j
ergy of each system 13 so utilized by cross- j
ing the lines of least resistance, that ali |
the generative forces in the form are
turned in upon itself, and create a pres
sure toward a common center. I can show
that that system is in harmony with world
building without the invention of any law
of gravitation or any other iaw separate
from matter or force, for a law is nothing
and does nothing.
"Laws do not execute themselves. It
takes force to create motion. /
"To show how easily NewtoV y might

received ray greeting coldly and suspicious

salutations, especially a Mr. Malen, a
pleasant type of the South African Dutch
man, who invited me to take a seat on the
banch near him and enteied into conver
sation with my companion and myself

At a round table with a colored cover,
whereon stood conspicuously among other
things a handsome silver-mounted to
bacco box, sat President Kruger in a com
fortable padded chair with a massive
metal spittoon at his feet. He sat well
back, with his hands folded over his chest.
The light from the nearest window
touched picturesquely on one side of his
large face, the leatures of which, were
rather dimly discernible in the existing
semi-ob'curity. Three or four men, rela
tives, looking like decent farmers or
tradesmen, sat nearly opposite to the
President, who, after I had been intro
duced by Mr. ' Weinthal, offered me a
hand to suase, and immediately
asked some question regarding my knowl
edge of Mr. Rhodes, which elicited a
laugh from the admiring relative with
whom I also exchanged handshakes. Mr.
Kruger making no objection I produced my
sketch book and set to work to study his
features in circumstances rather unfavor
I bratory energy that could be created with-
I in the form and substance of the boat by
j force I have only employed two.
"Now I want to say about Newton's ap
' pie that the apple before it fell from the
tree was fulfilling all the possibilities of
motion and vibration and was only a part
of a system the forces of which are so
mechanically and mathematically ar
ranged that the system controls and
utilizes all of the centrifugal and
kinetic energies in such a way as to
recur them bacK to the system and create
a motion and pressure, and when the ap
ple fell it was obeying a force and not a
law, and that force was a product of vibra
tion and that vibration was within the
' substance of the apple and not outside of
it. Nature never gets outside of itself. If
| it could Newton might put his centrifugal
I force where nature could not handle it.
"If you are a contractor and I "give you
a job to lay a stone sidewalk, about the
I first question you will ask is, what shape
do I want the block put down in. I will
tell you that there are but three shapes
that will fit a superficial area without in
terstices between, and they are the equi
lateral triangle, the hexagon and square.
You may make forms all your life and
make untold millions of them, but you
never can make forms that will fit a super
ficial area without leaving interstices be
tween but the three, but all the millions
that you could make only equal the three,
for the three embody all their lines. And
so it is with the solid figures. There are
but five solid figures that can have an
equal mathematical and mechanical divis
ion with a common center, and they are
called the platonic figures, after Plato,
who discovered them. Now you may
make untold millions of solid figures, but
you can never make one that can have a
mathematical division with a common
center but the five, and all the millions I
that you can make will only equal the five,
for they embody all their lines.
"So to with the principles of vibration
and life that run this universe. There are
millions of conditions of vibration, as
many as there are forms in it. or as many
as all the forms you can create, but there
is but one condition, or system of vibra
tion, and life, wherein the vibration re
curs back to first cause, or primary mo
tion; but all the millions of conditions of
vibration that you can create only equal
the one, for the one embodies all the
others. Nature never gets outside of
itself. And this recurrence of the vital
force of life back to the system of life, as I
can show, is what caused the thud or
pulse in the human and animal system or
body, and that ever-present pulse can be
detected in every and all forms or organ- I
ized life, even back to the protoplasm;
and not only in organized life, but in or
ganized force or energy, as in the gal
vanic battery, the waterspout, thunder
cloud or storm, and even in the lines of
force in the stationary magnet. The ever
present pulse can be detected, and so it is
able for drawing on account of the bad
light, but most favorable for studying his
manners and gestures as he entered into
conversation with Mr. Weinthal. His fa
vorite attitude was that already described
when we entered the room, but when he
spoke a great change in his voice and
manner took place; he sat forward, some
times roaring rather than speaking when
apparently excited, and flourishing his

Once in a peculiarly abrupt manner, as

to me that "however much he was drawn

"Some scientists tell us that evolution
is a spontaneous change from a uniform
structure, or a change from a homogene
ous to a heterogeneous condition. Now
what I claim is that the spontaneity is in
the uniformity and not in the change;
thai the chance is caused by the environ

spontaneity is because the environments
are ever present within the uniformity of
the structure of the vibratory system that

"The most discouraging part of tho

a lifetime and cleared away illusion after

back upon his reasoning faculties and asks
himself the question : Is there an absolute
reality within and beyond the reach of
human ken, and if there is, is all this side
of it a world of illusion ?
"To show you what I mean by illusion I
will illustrate. I will place eight cannon
balls on the arms of a four-foot wheel and
give that wheel a certain revolution and it
will look to you like a solid iron rim or
balance wheel, but you know it is not and
why? Because you have been undeceived.
You have seen it stop and start, or
seen some other wheel stop and start, but
if you had never been undeceived you
never would know but what this was a
solid iron wheel. All the knowledge that
comes to you from the outside world
comes to you through some of your five
senses. Now there are four of your senses
that have nothing to do with the analysis
of that problem; you cannot smell it, you
cannot taste it, you cannot hear it, you
cannot feel it, and the only sense that you
have left, your sight, is completely de
ceived, and if you have never been un
deceived you never would know but what
it was a solid iron rim.
"Now, if eight cannon balls, large ob
jects that you can ordinarily see with the
naked eye, are able to deceive the only
sense you have that" has' anything to do
with the problem,' and make you believe
that a condition or form is an entity when
It is not make you believe that an illu
sion is a reality â how much easier
is it for the indescribably small atoms
that cannot be seen with the best micro-
I scope, with an inconceivable velocity, to
deceive any and all your senses, and make
you think other things are real when they
are not, but only the condition of some
thing that is real. What the something
is we do not know. Call it atoms, call it

and that of a "Rooinek!'' Then the old
man meditatively spat into the spittoon and
sat slowly back again. Not being a "Taal"

you understand ? The President says that
'treaties with Germany only exist in the
newspapers.'" The President' once grew
very eloquent when Mr. Weinthal almost
brought on a violent discussion by re
marking that the Roman Catholic
Church of ' these times is not' what
it was in the days of persecutions,
for to put the case mildly Mr. Kruger is a
religious fanatic with a great admiration
expressed for Moses, the great leader of
the Israelites. Behind him on a pedestal
is a small copy of Michael Angelo's cele
brated figure of Moses, but between, that
conception of the ancient prophet and his
modern admirer it was difficult to find

Synopsis of Preceding Chapters.
W4J|"fiOXTAGUE VANDERHOLT, a retired Cape merchant, widowed and with
ttU 1 daughter, upon tne retired his merchant, widowed and take
h an only daughter, upon tne advice of his physician, determined to take
if\- _3 a cruise to the equator and back to London in his schooner yacht, the
Mowbrav. He engaged a Captain Glew to command the vessel end placed the
matter of selecting the crew ana purchasing the stores for the men in the fore
castle in his hands. In December, 18_8,*-Ir. Vanderholt and his daughter set sail
from London for their winter's cruise. On the fifth day of the voyage Captain
Glew acknowledged to Mr. Vanderholt that there was dissatisfaction among mem
bers of the crew on account of the quality of the meals served them. All that
night there were mutinous mutteringÃ among members of the watch. At the
crew's dinner hour the next day the sailors, led by the second mate, James Jones,
mutinied. They sent the kids containing their despised food flying toward the
quarterdeck where Mr. Vanderholt and his daughter and Captain Glew were con
gregated. Glew, with the assistance of the first mate, Tweed, attempted to piace
Jones, the leader of the mutiny, in irons. The remainder of the crew started to
rush to their leader's aid, but were stopped by Vanderholt, who, with pistol la
hand, declared that he would kill the first man who interlered witn the captain.
Daring the threatening pistol, Simon Toole, an Irish sailor, rushed into the melee
and stabbed the captain. At the same time Vanderholt fired, but the bullet killed
Mate Tweed instead of Toole, for whom It was intended. Then a sailor named
Maul killed Vanderholt with a belaying pin. All these horrible events transpired
before the horrified eyes of the daughter of the owner of the ship, who found her
self in agonizing helplessness with her dead at sea in a vessel manned by half
drunken, murderous madmen. On Dec.mb.r 20 of the same year the . ship
Alfred, Captain Barrington, bound from India to London, sights tne Mowbray
north of the equator and finds that she is deserted. A boat is sent aboard and
returns with the logbook, in which is found an unfinished entry, written by
Miss Vanderholt, telling the -story of the mutiny. Oue of the passengers on
hoard the Alfred is Captain Parry, to whom Miss Vanderholt is betrothed, and
he is naturally much moved by the discovery.
CHAPTER VI.
In the year of this story Old Leisure was still going to sea. He flour
ished as pleasantly upon the ocean as amid the hens and dunghills, the
milkmaids and dairie- of the Poyser farmyard. He brought his maintop
sail to the mast without reluctance, when there was anything to be Been
or talked to he went on board tbe stranger and din*-d with him; invited
the stranger in return, then leisurely proceeded. There was no prompt
dispatch to speak of, no urgency. The wind was the prevailing condition
of the immense distances which the wooden keel had to traverse. Old
Leisure kept his eye to windward and hauled out his bowlines, but it was
a time of ambling, of dozing, and of whistling for winds until too much
came.
Only in such a time as this now dealt with at sea could we conceive a
large full-rigged ship, homeward bound from India full of impatient
hearts, hove to with a derelict schooner within easy hail, and the com
mander taking plenty of time to reason about her with a gentleman who
was infinitely concerned in her unexpected, astounding apparition and
logbook narrative. Â»
"The thought of Miss Vanaerholt being at the mercy of a crew of mu
tinuous ruffians is unbearable," exclaimed captain Parry. "What is to
bedone? Advise me in the name of God, Captain. You know â know
â I have told you she was to be my wife. You are an old sailor. For
God's sake counsel me."
"If I could be sure that they made oil in- their boat and were still
afloat in her," answered the captain, "I should know now to advise you.
But if they have been received on board a ship then I don't see what can
bedone. For in what direction may that ship be heading? Enough if
your youn- lady should be safe, sir. Supposing her to be on board a ship Iâ¢.
nave no doubt of your hearing good news of her in the course of time â
after your arrival in England."
He opened the cabin door and called to one of the stewards.
"My compliments to the chief officer and ask him to come to me."
Mr. Mulready quickly presented himself.
"We have some notion," said Captain Barrington, addressing his mate
while he laid his hand upon the log of the Mowbray, "that the crew of
the schooner may have left her in their boat, taking the young lady with
them. Send a couple of hands don't trouble the young gentlemen,"
paid he, with a supercilious smile, vanishing almost as it appeared upon
his firm lips, "but a couple of sharp hands to the royalmast heads.
Give one of them this glass." He handed Mr. Mulready a binocular.
"Let the other take the ship's telescope aloft. I want the sea carefully
swept. Make them understand that they must creep in their search to
the very verge, for how far off is a boat visible? But they might sight
the gleam of her lugsail." *
Mr. Mulready took the glasses and went swiftly out. Captain Parry
stood at the window, listening to what was passing, straining his sight
also with consuming passions of dread, blind desire, helpless wrath at
the star-blue line of the sea that swept the brilliance of the heavens
within little more than a league. The captain of the ship went to a
locker and took out a chart of the Atlantic. He spread it and called to
Captain Parry. The officer turned and rapidly turned to the chart. He
saw zig-zag prickings or lines upon the white sheet, as though somebody
had been trying to represent Hashes of lightning. Each line terminated
in a little dotted circle. These were the "runs." But then these. were
also the doldrums, and the motive power of that ship, the Alfred, lay in
the breeze that in the doldrums blows in the delicate catspaw that
scarcely has power to run a shiver into a glazed breast.
"This was our situation at noon yesterday," said the commander, put
ting his finger upon the northmost little circle. "There is no land for
leagues, as you may observe." V r ,
"What are those rocks?" observed Parry, peering. .
"St. Paul's Island, a horrible hornet's nest of black fangs, entirely out
-of the boat's reach. lam not sure that I ever heard of a boat effecting a '
landing. , Any one cast -.shore there' must perish. There is nothing to"
eat or drink. It is the desolation of hell," added the commander with a
note of religious fervor in his speech, "and a dreadful surf like a night
mare of storm raves day and night round those rocks." â¢''"â¢.'.-'"âº'
"What is to be done?" said Captain Parry.' lifting himself erect from
the chart. "If they are in a boat they cannot be far distant. They have
not long left the schooner, but every stroke of the oar carries them further '
away, and renders the search more hopeless."
"The search?" exclaimed the commander in a note of inquiry and
surprise.
"I don't mean in this ship, of course," said the officer, speaking with
agitation and very quickly. "A clipper schooner lies close at hand. .If
you will lend me a navigator and a few hands we will sweep the sea, taking
this mark," he continued, putting his finger upon the chart, "as onr base,
and bunting with masthead lookouts and fires burning by night in circles
whose circumference or diameter I should leave to the judgment of the
mate in charge."
The commander began to slowly pace his cabin. Once he paused and
gazed with a face of earnest gravity at the sea that came brimming to the
counter in a sheet of winding line-, the light swathes of the tropic calm,
the oily gleam, the troubled tremble of some stream of current twinkling
in diamond--. Captain Parry eyed him with a passionate, silent anxiety,
He dreaded a discussion that might kill th- hope that bad suddenly been :
born in him. A tap on the door caused the commander to start. Mr.
Mulready entered. â¢ Â ; â¢ '
"The masthead men have been working hard with the ir glasses, sir
and report nothing in sight," ' â¢â¢ â¢ .
"How is tne schooner?'' â¢ -:
"Fprlorn, but safe, sir."
'Take a boat ana go aboard and make further examination of her and.
overhaul her stores; all as smartly as may be. sir. - This gentleman has
an idea, and I don't , know' but' that it might prove practicable," said the
commander, ana as Mr. Mulready left the cabin the captain of the ship '*
turned to Parry and asked him to follow him on deck. **â¢ â '.'â 
On the ciptain emerging the third mate approached and touched his
cap and,exclaimed.: ; "When I said there 'nothing living on board that
schooner, sir, I 'hould have reported a small coop lull of cocks and hens
all alive .and very hungry and thirsty. 7 I fed thorn with some rice I found
in the galley and poured a quantity of. water into their trough." *â¢' He sa
luted and marched off. [ *â¢.,' .-..'â¢
"In the T face â6fÂ» Miss Vanderholt's last entry," said the captain to
Parry, "we don't want live cocks and hens to tell us that the vessel has

Aptain Barrington and Captain Parry stood together at the mizzen

shrouds, looking at the schooner, conversing and waiting for the return
of the mate. The passengers very respectfully gave them a wide berth.
"No," says Captain Barrinpton presently, "I shall have no objection,
sir. lamto be influenced by humanity in this business. My owners
cannot and will not object," he added, as if thinking aloud. "We shall
be saving a valuable yacht. Mr. Blundell is a very efficient young officer,
quite experienced enough to take charge; and he will receive certain in
structions from me, sir. for we must define the area of sea to be searched
and the time to be taken."
Ho looked at the schooner thoughtfully. "She is under 200 tons." said
he. "Mr. Blundell and four men and a boy should suffice. I can spare
no more."
"i am no sailor, but I can pull nnd haul." said Captain Parry. "I can
do a man's bit. What time would you limit us to?"
"I should wish to be a little elastic. There's no wind here to depend
upon," answered the commander. "I will see Mr. Blundell in my cabin
after breakfast and explain my ideas."
It was 10 o'clock when the mate returned from the Mowbray. All this
while the sea remained satin smooth. The sun soaring high burnt fiercely,
the paint bubbled in blisters, the pitch ran iv sofisoap and the whole
light of the tchooner's canvas poured under her in quivering sheets of
quicksilver. Mr. Mulready was dark with dirt and sweat, and looked like
a man who as passed a wees in stowing a snip's hold. Captain Parry
stood in tbe gangway to receive him, nod the mate's immediate inquiry
was for the commander. He was closeted with Mr. Blundell.
"What news can you give me?" said the military officer, grasping the
dry-minded mate by the arm and looking beseechingly into his face.
"There's just plenty of stores and fresh water," answered Mr. Mul
ready, "enough to last a small crew six months. . Her after hold is rich in
the eating line. - There are about two dozen cocks and hens."
"I don't mean that," exclaimed Parry wildly. "Did you find no hint
of the fate of the young lady '! '
"My answer must be," answered the mate with a certain forma), sym-

pathetic gravity, "that nothing is alive on yonder vessel saving a few
cocks arid hens." .'""".:
. The captain made his appearance, followed by Mr. Blundell.
"I have arranged with the third officer," said he, walking straight up
to Captain Parry and the mate, "that he shall take charge of the yacht
and search for the boat. There can be no hurry while this clock calm
lasts. Still 1 dare say you will be glal to go on board." *
"I'm mad to" go on board," answered Captain Parry.
"Get your luggage together, then, sir. Mr. Blundell will provide the
schooner with a couple of pistols out of the 'arras chest and the necessary
ammunition. If you tall in with the boat remember, they are eight sea
men rendered desperate by murder. You will be but seven. The possi- .
bility is but faintâ the chance is the smallest," the captain muttered in a
dying voice. . v .' ,
"I thank yon for your foresight." said Parry, and he went hastily to
his cabin-to pack up. _â â¢- â¢ :", :
The mate told the captain that there was' plenty of rockets and port
fires aboard the schooner. A fireball, by night : might bring the boat to
the yacht. He then produced a piece of paper and gave the commander
an idea of the quantity of stores in the little vessel.
'-â¢.*. "They'll want nothing from us, ? then." said Captain Barrington.
"However, since the mv* tny seems to have been owing to the rottenness
of the food, sling a couple of.casks of our beef into the boat."
It was 11 o'clock when nil was ready for Captain Perry to go on board
the Mowbray. Four men and a ooy had volunteered as a crew, and when
the boat was freighted she lay deep along side with seamen's cheits, lug
gage, casks of beef and human beings. The passengers made a tender
fareweli this singular and most romantic leave-taking in midocean. '
They pressed forward to shake Captain Parry by the hand. Some hoped'
that the blessing of God would attend his' search. More than that one
lady raised a handkerchief to her eyes. As the boat shoved off a hearty
cheer broke from the whole length of the vessel. The boat reached the
side of the Mowbray, ana all that was to be received on board was
handed up. ;
Captain Parry breathed deep and wore a in his looks while
he stood for a few minutes gazing roundabout him. Of course he remem
bered the little ship perfectly wellâ the delightful -cruise he had "taken in
her with Violet and her lather a little while before he returned to India.
He looked and began to realize the. brutal scene as the girl hat sketched
it in that last entry. It was hard to think of his immensely wealthy
friend, Vanderholt, meeting a mean, base end at the hands of a
brutal Ratcliffe sailor. '. What had they done with Violet?
He searched as the two mates had searched, and, of course, found more
than they. He beheld in a cabin memorials of his sweetheart â her dresses,
her hats, a veil and a 'pair of gloves lay in her cot. One glove was still
bulked with'- the r impress of her hand, as though she bad but just now
drawn it off in a hurry and cast it down. He peered narrowly, -j The cabin
was a charming little bouioir. He witnessed no suggestions of violence,
nothing appeared to have been disturbed. He sought for marks of blood,
then thought to himself: "If she is murdered they did not kill her with a
knife, they drowned her." , ../ C, - \ '
He stayed for half an hour in this cabin, then entered the adjoining
berth, which had been Mr. Vanderholt's. H- found nothing to help him
here. The old gentleman had been eccentric. He had believed be loved
the life of the forecastle. God help him! and he had illustrated his - idle
imagination of fondness by causing his berth to be rendered as uncomfort
able as possible. '
Parry was disturbed in his investigations of this berth by a bustle in
the cabin. He looked out and saw a couple of sailors coming down with
his luggage. /
"Tumble those traps in here," he said. , "Are we moving?" : ' l : jJ
"It is a fact, sir," said one of the men. who was a. Swede. "A little
gentle vindt has begun to blow, and der Alfred is going heme."
"Home? Ido not quite understand," exclaimed Captain Parry.
He said no more, however, to the men, and went on deck to look
about him.
Mr. Blundell was a stout, hearty young sailor, about 22 years of age
He had that sort of face which is often met. at sea under both flagsper
fectly hairless, fleshy, permanently tinctured by the roasting fires and the
drying-in gales and irosts of ocean travel. He was looking at the com
pass of the schooner when Captain Parry approached. Perhaps he
sought for a hint or two in gear that did not lead like a ship's and canvas
that was not shaped for tquare yards. At a motion from Captain Parry
he drew away from the helmsman. -.* -.*
"I am nt a loss," said tbe captain, looking at the ship under the shel
ter of his hand. "Is the Alfred going home?"
"Certainly, sir," answered Mr. Blundell. "We've dipped our farewell.
We're now on our own hoof."
"Then I mistook. I supposed when Captain Barrington talked of
limiting us to time that be intended we should return to him here," said
Captain Parry.
The young mate smiled. "His notion in limiting us to time," said
he. "was that we should not run the quest into a hopeless job. There
should be a limit."
"Of course, a reasonable limit," said Parry. "What is it?"
"It has been left to my judgment, sir; and I am willing to be governed
by you."'
"Thanks, Blundell."
Captain Parry, pronouncing this sentence with warmth and emotion,
stepped to the binnacle and looked at the card.
"You are holding tbe schooner northwest," said he. "You have a
reason?"
"We must head her on one course or another," answered Blundell.
"I propose, with your leave, to carry out Captain Barrington's ideas. He
has sketched me a circular course. I'll compass it off on the chart below
presently, and you shall form your own opinion. Loose the square can
vas, my lads," he sang out, abruptly breaking from Captain Parry.
The captain lent a hand to pull and haul. He dragged to the music of
the salt throats at the sheets and halliards. The breeze freshened in a
steady gushing.' The ocean was a miraeie of laughing light. Already
you heard the snore of foam at the cutwater and the steady hiss of its
passage aft. The Alfred was growing small and square in the blue dis
tance. She was feeling the breeze now, and her pale and shapely shadow
leaned as she beaded with an occasional dim flash from her wet black
sides into the far northern recess.
Captain Parry went below and returned on deck with the binoculars,
which he had observed in Mr. Vanderholt's cabin. The main rigging of
the Mowbray was rattled down to the height of the lower masthead. The
captain got into the shrouds and made his way to the cross trees. Higher,

shroud tbat was sweating tar; with the other he lifted the glasses and
searched the sea till his eyes swelled and throbbed in their sockets. When
he descended he said to the mate: . â¢
"I have wondered why tb<> men should have left the schooner afloat
Don't they usually scuttle vessels in affairs of this sort?"
"I heard the captain and the second officer talk this matter over,"
said Mr. Blundell. "Th_ second mate thought that trie villains knew what'
they were at out when they left the schooner floating. She would De met
with and boarded. They'd rind nothing to give them an idea of what had
happened. So she'd be carried away to a port as a mystery and that would
' be giving the men a better chance than bad they scuttled her."
"Why ?-Â£_Bm_i-SÂ«---3Â£ig^gÃm
'â¢ "Al ways one of the men who've been concerned in bloody business
of this sort finds his way to a hospital. He lies alongside another man
and gabbles. The second mate seemed to think that if one of the men of
this yacht turned up at a hospital and gahbled less would be made of
what he said if the schooner had been towed into port a** a mystery than
had she been sunk. For my part," added Mr. Blundell, "I believe they
left her afloat because they couldn't find the heart to sink her. She is a
â¢ beauty," he murmured, and he whistled as he looked aloft arid aropud.
"I take the second male's view," said Captain Parry. .
' "This is how Captain Barrington hope.-- we'll work it, sir," said Blunt
dell, coming out ot Captain Glew's berth a little later and putting a char
upon the tab :'â '' 'p. . -...-â â .â ..

measuring distances. He nulled a paper covered with calculations from

â  "This will.be it, I think, "sir,". said Blundell, sticking a leg of the com.

paned company with the Alfred. We allow the boat a start of ihirty
six hours, remembering always that our weather will have been hers." . *
"Quite so," exclaimed Captain Parry, devouring every word.
"1 am now hea'aing," continued the mate, with a glance at the paper,
"to arrive at this" point'? Here he put the "pencil end of the compasses"
upon the chart. "When we arrive there our navigation will be this""'
He now, with great care and constant, references to the paper of
figures, together with a frequent use of the nautical instrument for meas
uring distances, described a number of circles. These circles lay one
within another, and when coin pie tea' they might be likened to a cone
shaped spring, or to a corkscrew.' looked at vertically.
--â¢ "You will perceive, Captain Parry," said the mate, "that the distance'
between each circle is the same. How far can a man see from the schoo
ner's royal yard? Well, Captain Barrington would not allow that he
should b" â  able to see so small an object as a boat even, with a good tele
scope, at a greater distance than fifteen miles, though : probably a man
might lift a good forty-mile view of the horizon by climbing Vie j schooner s
foremast Fifteen miles to port and fifteen to starboard. La circle,
therefore, is thirty miles wide." .
"If the boat is afloat," exclaimed Captain Parry, viewing the disks
with admiration full of bops, "she must positively ba within one of these
circles." :â  "' â¢

"Frankly, sir,. the smallest chance that ever was found at sea.' an
swered the young mate, rolling up his chart. ,V ' '
"The horrible consideration with me," said Captain Parry, "is that
the young lady may not be in the boat."
Mr. Blundell looked slowly around the cabin, but made no answer.
CHAPTER VII.
THE DISCOVERY. :?-i V
The wind that evening freshened out of the northwest glare of sunset.
The sky thickened and some small wings of scu i flew southeast, bronzed
by the wes crn splendor dimming fast. The sea ran in a cloudy green,
but without weight in the light tropic surge.
At sundown Mr. Blundell hailed the royal yard and the answer, hoarse
in tone as a seagull's scream, after another patient search of 'the' sea line
" with a high-perched telescope, was â¢â¢Nothing in sight, sir." Then the
mate ordered the man to comedown on deck, and half an houi later, when
darkness was on the lace of the deep and the last red scar had died out of
the starless sky, the Mowbray was slopping softly through the creaming
waters under her mainsail and standing jib only. <'.
The little, ship stood . against the black of the night, fire-tinctnred.
She looked,' with her glowing yellow masts, her fiery shrouds, to be built
of flame. , The night came in wails of blackness to this Deaitti.lul vision,
and the noise of the sea, and the sense of the infinity of the deep that was
. running and seething out of sight filled the glowing picture with an en
trancing spirit of mystery. You would have said that sic owed her life
and light to tbe sea gods.
*';'... Both Parry and the mate while this flare was burning repeatedly di
rec ed their night glasses at the ocean, and even' while it burnt a man
came aft to the call of tne mate and sent up a couple of rockets. . The
fireballs hissed, burst and vanished in spangh a, darting , a luster as of
lightning across a little space of sky. The flare rackled, leaped up,
smoldered and was extinguished by a bucket of water. A couple of
lanterns, bright, globular glasses, were lighted and hung up in tbs main
rigging, one on each side. -This brought the hour to about 10:15. The
sea was again searched, its ghastly face had stolen out and the heads of
. the breakin billows under that thick and pallid sky. were Use the flashes
of guns in mist. ; : ..â' :;--â¢â  â¢>'> 7 'yf^ i !y'^.n^j : i'!,^;:''--..
. .'lf the lady isn't in this circle, Captain Parry," said Mr. Blundell
â  cheerfully, "let's hope we'll find her in the next. If the boat's within ten.
miles of us they'll have seen our flare and those fireballs.'' .. '' p * v
"But we are moving through tbe sea," said Captain Parry. "It we
make them a head wind and continue to sail, how are they to fetch us?"
"The schooner's only just under command, sir. If I heave to thedrift
will put me out. With your kind leave I'll go below and get a glass of
grog." . . .- -;. ;.â¢ . â â¢â¢*,*-.
They both went into the cabin leaving a man. to look out. They were
waited upon by the boy, who was indeed a young man of about 28. with
a face full of sallow fluff and an old man's look in his eyes and in the con
traction of his brow>, as though he had been born in the workhouse and
kn w life. But at sea there are but three grades, anu if you don't sign
articles as an able seaman, then if you were 80 years old and could scarcely
creep over the ship's side with your cargo of scythe and hour glass, you'd
be called a boy. -r>% iy - >V ; â¢ â¢
-The mate and Captain Parry sat for a little in the cabin sipping cool

"Should the men in the boat see our flares and. rockets," said the
captain, "what will they think of them?" ..-._â¢/â  * :.

"But if they make out that we are the schooner of their piracies and

"She's an open boat, sir, and you have to consider how men ; will 'be

her this' side the horizon' we may easily keep her in sight till we've worn
them out v*:;i â â ".'â  J'j-~- -;"â â . ' "" > '*"*- ; V
"I have been thinking of these red-hot skies, too. Will Miss Vander
holt bo able to survive the exposure of even a day and night?" and
Captain Parry swayed in his chair with a grief of the thought.
"Well," said the mate, with the note of a stout heart in his voice,
"only a sailor is abe to tell a man what ladies really can go through.
.Low-class females, emigrants and the like, cave in quickly ; they are the
sbriekers. They cannot bear terror, and it kills them on rafts and in
boats. But your thoroughbred lady is always the one. that I've seen,
heard of and read of who ha* shown a lion's heart and the coldness of a
stone bead" in shipwreck. If Miss Vanderholt be in tie boat you'll find
that she'll have suffered less than the men." . " .
â  * A faint smilo stirred the lips of Captain Parry, bnt he grew quickly
grave again with the distress of his imagination.-" At that momenta hoarse
cry in the skylight made them spring to their feet* ' 'â  ** - --'--â¢
"There's a big ship a- bearing down upon us." '"
",'.' The mate rushed up. the followed by Captain Parry. 7. The ghostly
sheen of the moon still clouded as with steam the thickness of the night,
â  and the scene of heaven and sea was mystical with elusive distance, with
the soft, near flash of the surge and the windy chaos of the horizon. On
the bow. not half a mile distant, was a large, pale shape. The night-glass
made her white bulled, with canvas to her trucks. The schooner was
thrown into the wind. It was clearly "the intention of the stranger to
speak the Mowbray. Through the small, scattering hiss of the sea on
either hand you might have heard the low, constant thunder of the bow
wave of the ship as she came crushing through the brine, making a light
for herself with her sides and white heights, but showing no lights, till on
a sudden the human silence was broken by a short, gruff comman.t, weak
with distance. The sound might then be beard of yaids being swung,
ropes crowed in blocks, parels creaked on masts, and in a few minutes a
large white ship, with the fires of the sea' dripping at her cutwater, lay
abreast of the schooner, all way choked out of her by the hacked topsail.
t.. '.'Schooner auoy !"..,; I. \{ Â£ \ .... .i .;' ,' ;,
"Hello!" shouted Mr. Blendell, sending his voice far into the dark
ness over the ship's rail whence the hail had proceeded.
"What's wrong with you that you are sending up rockets and burning
fires ?' ' -
v_y.. "We are in search of a boat. Have you met with a boat containing
eight men and a lady?" J,iirh, sJ'-'^ ;Vf-A% Â°
A short silence ensued.
â â  "What schooner are you?"
"The Mowbray, of and now for the Thames, when we recover the boat.
What ship are you?" vV; -v- -
"The Georgina Wilde. Liverpool, to Melbourne. I expect your people
have been resent dV We passed a schooner's, long boat yesterday morn
ing, and read your name, the Mowbray, in her stern sheets."
"If that's the case,'' exclaimed Mr. Blundell quickly, to Captain Parry
"there'll be no pood left in this circe job." - ;.".r .- ' -
"Has he no more information to give us?" said Captain Parry, with a.
hopeless stare at the tall, pale shadow, upon whose decks nothing was vis
ible in that thickness save a dull will-o'-the-wisp-like glimmer where the
binnacle stand stood. ... .
The schooner was bailed again.
"Hello!" answered Blundell. *â¢
' "We sighted a derelict yesterday at noon. i She was within a mile or
two of the long boat. Looked like a small brig timber-laden."
"How would she bear from us now?" baweled the mate.
"The bearing of the derelict," shouted the voice in tones of the volume
of a speaking trumpet, "will be northwest by north, half north. About
x Don't take this as if was an observation. Try about forty miles on that
'course, and. if nothing heaves into' view sweep the sea. The derelict's
bound to be afloat. Farewell, good luck attend you." Then, a minute
later, "Swing the roaintopsail yard. Ease away your weather main
brace." ..*..- Â«...
The pale, lofty shadow leaned from the damp night breeze and the
water trembled into fire along the visionary length of her,' when, with a
soft stoop of. bow to some invisible heave of the ocean, she broke her way
onward, dissolving quickly into the night. * ' â '*. -*-.â 'â¢'â¢
"About forty miles distant," said Mr. Blundell, stepping to the comp
ass. "Shall we head on a course' for her, sir?"
"Oh, most certainly, ", answered Captain Parry.
"Better jog along under easy canvas till it comes daylight anyhow '*
said the mate. s.\--;>.*Â»a? ;"-*.--* * J '
The course was shifted, sail trimmed, the gaff foresail was set and the
pchooner, carrying the midnight breeze abeam, glided soundlessly through
the gloom over the black, wide heave of the sea.
j. Captain Parry was too anxious to take a rest. He lighted a cheroot
and paced the deck with Mr. Blundell. who had heroically resolved not to
turn in that nightâ not to turn iv at all until the timber-laden d-relict
had been sighted, boarded and run maged. They kept the lanterns burn
ing in the rigging. .They. never knew how it might be with the eight men
and the lady, supposing-! the laav 7.6 be; with them. ..It is true that the
long boat had been fallen in with adrift, but then, as Mr. Blundell put it
"that might be due to : an accident without signifying that they'd been re-'
ceivedon i board a ship and their boat let go." ,v. â '.â¢'â¢'..â¢.â â 
"My own view's this, sir," said he, _*isi he I lighted 'one of Parry's
cheroots at the glowing tip of the captain's. "The men saw that timber

* ' -THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN LIFE
"Tjhrough ZRepontanco and m7aithm **
Which Will Xead to & apt ism."
BISHOP NICHOLS
Tiie problem oi human life as we are living It may be practically stated in
the question: . "How arc we to make the most of it?" Theory and practice, past
â¢ and present, show all the ways of the trying to solve the problem trom tho
' epicurean, "Let us cat and drink, for tomorrow we die," up to the most vivid
realization ot Christ's promise: "I am come that they might have life and that
they might have it more abundantly. " Multitudes in every generation simply
" give it up. Some ever cipher on. covering the blackboard of their years with
. hopeless figuring. Others think to play truant to it- altogether in self-destruc
tion. Others use the chalk and board to caricature the great teacher or to ad
mire their own names "writ large." Still others only look upon it as a matter of
getting through some coming examinations, having an idea that when the time
comes they can crib some one else's work. And so the school ever keeps. Weall
â  have to take this problem of human life because we all live.
Is anybody getting the answer? Those who are working upon it with the
method of Jesus Christ believe they are. Nineteen centuries of them have
' believed they were and have died in tbe belief. They have felt that he perfectly
.. understood all the terms. They have seen that he knew about equations which
have the unknown quantities of another life, to b3 known when the answer is all
reached. They have felt with a great thinker like Bishop Butler, that what we
see here is the incomplete part of a greater theorem. They have recognized that
man does not live long enough here, or develop enough here, or become symmet
rical enoueh here toexpress all there is in his life. There is a genius in humanity
which humanity nerc does not fully exhibit". The poet cannot get all his inspira
tion into his verse, the artist all his sense of grace and beauty on tHe canvas or in
' the marble, the musician all his harmonies in the score, and the Christian can
not find interpretation for all his We with Christ in an* experience of earth.
Christ teaches how to work out the other world equations. "The Son ot God
became Son of Man that the sons of men might become sons of God." To the one
puzzled with all the labor and travail he says "Come." To the one finding doubt
- too hard to work out he promises guidance into truth. Aud every one can find
and freely use his schoolroom. The most direct path is through repentance and
faith, which lead to nis baptism and then to the other steps of an avowed dis
ciplcship. . Why not every "eary worker and high thinker over human problems
try him and his method?
77Jan -Himself Sives Value
"Uo -His Own {Passions.
REV. E. R. DILLE,
Pastor of the Central M. E. Churcn.
I find the solution in these words of Jesus: "A man's life consists not in the
abundance of the things which he po.'sesseth."
Whatever helps to make men larger -and better is alone of real worth. It is
the man that gives value to his possessions, his surroundings ; they are powerless
to give value to him. Men are not here to make money, but money is here to
make men.
To cultivate the higher qualities Is the real business of life, the right
employment of our thoughts, the due restriction of our desires, the resolute
resistance of seductive temptation, the faithful discharge of duty, a conscientious
regard for the rights of others, a tender sympathy for their suffering, a brotherly
Interest in their welfare, and above all habitual conformity to the law of Godâ
these are the elements of a true life.
' I do not see how any one that believes in a future life at all can doubt that a
man's true life consists in preparation for the whole term of his being, and the
life that is cot so used is a failure, whatever else it may accomplish, or however
high a man's monument or glowing his epitaph may be.

REV. JAMES WOODWORTH. .
I have been a farmer, a gold miner and a druggist, following each of these
professions both on my own account and for wages, sometimes very small â
low as !*H> a month. I have been "â¢flush" with plenty of money for the supply of
all reasonable wants end a little to "lay by," and I have been without a cent to
relieve the demands of hunger, though with plenty all around me. For thirty
five years I have been a minister, most of the time in this City ; engaged in mis
siou and other work which has brought me into contact with men of all classes,
young and old, from the prisoner in his cell and the penniless stranger in the
hospital to the millionaire in bis office or his home, the high and the low, the
ich and the poor, the ignorant and the learned, the rude and the refined, men,
in hovels and in legislative halls, men housed in. palaces and men wandering
homeless and friendless, .upon the .street, and as a result of my experience and
observation I give ii as my deliberate judgment that the only true solution of the
problem of life lies in making it one of strict Integrity and purity, in thought
and feeling as well as in word and in outward acts,' regardless of consequences or
of "what Mrs. Grundy will say," coupled with untiring industry and dogged per
severance in pursuit of whatever may be presented as duty.

"Uho {Problem Ss Solved.
REV. A. G. WELLS.
The* riddle of life has an interpreting word. That word is "Education."
All life Is education. It is the drawing out of man's power. All the revelation
there is or ever has been has come from the unfolding of man's capacities and
the unveiling of the universe beiore the uprising race. Human progress comes
from the compulsion put upon us to find out things. What is needed then ?
Trust in the integrity of the universe, in the wisdom of the silent power that
- steadily uplifts the race; a face to face relation with God; the child's heart, the
man's sagacity, the single purpose.
We are but children if we can only follow a direction, obey a precept,
confide in a text, store at a miracle, and have no might of- our own, no ideality,
no lagrc perceptions. To think tnat revelation is complete, the book closed, the
- v ice silent, the inspiration withdrawn, is not to believe in the living God, is to
distrust reason, be deaf to the whispering spirit ever present, shut up to the dead
past, deaf to the sanctities of the living present.

REV. EDWARDS DAVIS,

The solution of the social problem depends on individual deportmentâ not
dreams, but deeds. Not on the battle-field, not in the legislative hall, not on the
â "rostrum stage or pulpit, not in the home, but in the alley, In the gutter,' in the
pesthouse, the asylum, the prison, there shall the incarnate Christ be. When
honor shall be given to the past purity of a fallen woman and to the marred image
â¢of Godâ a ruined man (a fallen woman never fell without a fallen man); when
the peanut-vender, the bootblack, the street-sweeper, the flower-girl; when the
poor, the oppressed shall take place with the humble, who have reason to be
proud, then shall the human brotherhood reaca from the gutter unto God.

Professor . Bessey, who occupies the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
What is the problem of human life?
This question has been asked by learned doctors and lisping children.
As a supreme essence it invades the world of thought *, a haunting, subtle something which is behind and. beyond all
human endeavor and material consummation. Many se.m to think that they have solved it, as the interviews and answers
from prominent persons, given to THE CALL, will attest.
But the "still, small voice" of questioning is not hushedâ its whispering is unceasing.
The followers of Buddha believe this life is but a penance, and earth but a place of punishment for the sins of some past
existence of the soul on its tedious way to perfection and eternal peace. And that to expect only its sorrows and suffering's, to
live it out in a kind of sullen resignation to the inevitable â to hope for nothing â if possible to "neither smile nor weep," is to
best solve the reason for its time of endurance.
The cheerful Christian makes the best of life's disappointments and contradictions ; attributes to a wise and merciful
Providence all that he cannot understand; sings over the grave of his fellowman hymns full of hop. and consolation, and covers
a multitude of shortcomings in life and all connected with it by the broad mantle of an unquestioning faith and charity.
Ask the astrologer of this problem of life as he scans the starry heavens while the world is wrapped in selfish sleep. He
will tell you: " .7
â¢ 1 live that future man may read
The revelations of my creed.
Ask it of the priest at his devotions in the watches of the night and he will answer :
This human life is but a span, "'
Too short to intercede for man ;
So, while the countless ages roll,
1 pray for his undying soul.
Ask of the mother who guards the slumber of fur child and she will make answer thatâ
Her task is sweet, in God's great plan,
To rear a good and honest man.
Ask the question of the lover, who in the supreme delight of an adored presence forgets all time, and he will tell you that
it is to love and be beloved.
The gentle and gifted Robert Louis Stevenson wrote that to truly live is â
To be honest, to be kind ; to earn a little and spend a little less.
With a thousand answers, sharp or undefined, the question yet lives. It will not down.
For what do we live? .

REV. GEO-OE GIBSON, ' I
Pastor of Emanuel Baptist Church.
Each man must settle the problem of life for himself. I have come to the
conclusion that there is a God and that he is love. Life to me is a beautiful
thing because there is so much to enjoy. The sky, with its stars, belongs to. me
as much as to the rich man on Nob Hill; the flowers are mine to admire even if i
do not have a garden.
Then life is worth living because one can improve so ranch. It is as good as a
holiday to feel I hat one has conquered a bad habit The growing man Is just as
happy as the growing boy. To be rich in one's self Is best of ail. The conscious
ness that we are developing into true manhood excels all pleasures. Of tourse it
counts for something to be rich. That some of us never will be. What then?
We are human beings, anyhow, and it is out of our humanity there comes the
character that supplies joy aud peace.
Then 1 want to live because I can 1c so helpful to others. How grand to have
the young come to you with their difficulties! How pleasant to loan a book to the
student who has to write his first essay! Happy ! Why should one not be happy?
Yes, I know that some will say the writer has had an easy life. There the reader
is mistake*!- Some day he may turn author, and when he aoes he will get all tne
material ior a novel out of his own experiences.
Sorrow and suffering make a dark mystery to the person who sits at home
ana thinks a:.out happiness. Selfishness solves few problems. The helpful per
son never wants to die. As Swinburne says â
Into each man his handiwork;
Into each Ms crown.

C?rror and {Perversity / 777-
Uhe {Pesuli of Synorance.
FATHER U. H. WYMAN.
A man ought to live according to right reason. That is to say according to
conscience, which is a dictate of reason. The obstacles to a correct conscience
are Ignorance and concupiscence, both of which may be overcome by effort, as
sisted by divine trace. ' Error and perversity are the results of the domination of
ignorance and concupiscence over reason.
True religious conviction rests primp in* the understanding. It is not &
mere sentiment of the heart. In other Words a true moral cannot exist without a
true doctrinal system in religion. In the Catholic system the doctrines of faith
and the principles of morality are as intimately united as the intellect and the
wi 1 iv men.
In the work of evangelization the preacher must first appeal to the under
standings, not to the emotional natures of his hearers, oth.rwlso nls converts
would not be solidly grounded in the truth. I believe that often great harm has
been done to religion by receiving into thechurches during the so-called revivals
of religion persons who do not understand any Christian system cf doctrine and
morals. A preacher cannot be too earnest in teaching religion, provided he is
sincere, but zeal must always be regulated by prudence. Tho>e who wouid build
wisely must be content to go slowly and carefully. We must first reason with
men before we can hope to persuade them.

I bushes which grow at long intervals on
| the mesa to a height of from twelve to
j eighteen feet The Mexicans know it as
the "Palo Christo," and the Catholic
churches in Southern Arizona are always
decorated with the thorny, branches at
Eastertime.
Professor Bess.y has made cross-sec
tions out of previous specimens sent to
him from Phoenix, and bis own language
is that "these sections disclose a very rare
and wonderful plant of which the botani
cal world kno^s but very little."
The bushes, as seen on the desert not
far from Phconix, have a most forbidding
appearance. Only their remarkable odd
ity attracts one's attention. All of the
plants of the desert have something to
attract one to them, and offer a certain
picturesqiieness and beauty, either of
former color, to the eyeâall of them
except this bush of wicked-looking thorns.
The bushes are all thorns, and nothing
but thorns, and their wound is cruel and
.lasting, lor there is said to be a poison
lurking in the tip of them. The poison is
not deadly, nor even dangerous, hut
troublesome and painful, and most pros
pectors would rather run into a charge of
buck-hot than into a "crucifixion thorn"
bush.
7 During ten months of the year the limbs
of the bush are absolutely bare, except for
its thorns. .Those are from one to three
inches in length, sharp as needles, and
fully as hard and- strong, only they are
thicker at the base and taper very gradu
ally to the point of disappearance. Early
in the spring the "p'alo christo" puts
forth a .tiny green blossom,. which soon
ripens into - clusters of email, yellowish

DR. NIETO.
Dr. Nleto said that he could give no general rules for conduct for the solution
of life's problem, for the reason that differelices of condition was so prominent a
feature. Temperament, environment and education were essential factors in
every human life, but these were not alike in any two individuals. However the
strife should be to keep as clear as possible from the exigencies and predicaments
of existence that work injury to the best personal effort and activity. Life
should be dealt with not as theory and speculation, philosophy aud theology
would have it, but as one finds life actually to be.
In regard to abstract ideas the doctor thought every one had a right to exer
cise the fullest liberty. God and the human soul were abstract ideas and any one
had a perfect right lo think of those ideas as he pleased.
All nature is excessive and superabundant. The spontaneous natural growth
of a tree is excessive and wasteful, but the pruning-knife will direct its life forces
into more profitable growth than if left to itself, So one may help and direct
human lite, which is also excessive, into more wholesome channels by wisdom,
care and torethought. KfHfe "
I believe iv the co-operative plan in the equalization of labor. The wage
system of our social condition is all wrong, for it forces labor into servitude to
wealth, whereas labor should be a partner. B_S_H _SWSS
The man who buys aud sells doubles the prices of produce. They should be
equal, with a balance, if any, in favor of the producer. The wealth of brain, of

MRS. 8. K. BRADSHAW.

' . To solve the problem of life requites a clear understanding of the principle
and law that governs it and the yielding of personal opinions to the verdict of
science. Life is mind, aud what we need is scientific education on that basis.
Materialism is sell-destroying, and has proven a dismal failure. Why not make
it a radical change? It is not necessary to go on in a state of ignorance, making
mistakes, being sick and mentally discordant and unhappy. Power is inherent
ln miud only. A comprehension of that fact will enable one to act in accordance
with the supremacy oi mind and to gain a power over sin and disease that no
other faculty can give.
Whatever is impossible or delusive is not an ideal. There must be a recog
nized standard to guide one's work, and one's ideal of life must be definite and
true â an embodiment of principle ; then it can be proven and realize!. â 
Science has no fellowship with anything that lacks principle and proof. The
demonstration ot spiritual power over the material claims reveals the science of
Christianity, and will enable us to maintain the conditions essential for true liv
ing and briug to light the Christ-like character.

' REV. WILLIAM IIADER.
Pastor of the Third Congregational Church.
The solution of life's problem requires time. A man may be converted sud
denly, but no man is equipped with character suddenly. The religious life is not
reached* at a sudden bound, but by patient endeavor and a long process of
development. It is an eternal evolution. If the Bible were placed in the bands
of every heathen in the world during the next week heathenism would not be
conquered. Civilization, which includes a Christian commerce, a Christian
industry and social order and a regenerated individuality, is the end of missions*
A revival of religion is the beginning, not the end, of Christian character.
What the world needs is character. It has faith and it has motive, but where
men fail is at the point where the good intention is translated into life. It is at
this point where Christ, as the Savior of the world and as an example of the art
of living and as the motivo to true repentance unto salvation, comes to tho rescue.
If the world is to be saved at all it is to be saved by Jesus Christ, which means
the acceptance of his teachings in their application to society and the individual,
and an implicit trust and complete surrender of one's life 10 his life. - 'â .

The most remarkable thing about these
bushes is that they are supposed to take
in their sustenance through the infini
tesimally fine, steel-like ends of the
thorns. And though the thorns are very
plentiful; yet the feeding and breathing
points must be so very small that one
can easily realize why the plant has' such
a barren and unhealthy appearance. At
its best, when water, sunshine and good
soil are at the maximum and all the
other trees and flowers in the valley are
a cure for weary eyes to look upon, the
crucifixion thorn seems to be a poor, half

A Wonderful Spanish Family
The Sent fa Kosario Moreno de Me.'endrcz, widow of Don Antonio de M?lendrez, living near San Diego, presents a case of
remarkable fecundity. She is the mother of eighteen children, all living, and all live under tho paternal roof with their families.
The senora is the owner of most of Santa Clara Valley in Lower California, about* 175 miles south of San Diego and sixty miles
east of Ensenada. The Melendrrz family has lived there from time" immemorial, having its cattle on a thousand hills. The
accompanying picture shows t. senora to tie right of the girl with the baby in her lap. The old men in the rear and the Indian
woman next to the men are the only persons in the group who are not the descendants of Donna llosario. The old lady's hair is
j still as black as the raven's wing and she is full of business, attending personally to her lame ranch and managing all her eighteen
I children, their wives and husband *, besides the grandchildren. It is like a scene of biblical times to see the family gather around
an immense table, with the old woman at the head, dispensing hospitality on a wholesale plan.
A photographer passed by the ranchhouse and old Donna Rosario improved the opportunity to get a picture of past of her
| progeny. Boys were hurriedly sent out on horses to various parts of the ranch, where their brothers were herding cattle' or break
! ing broncos, and within half an hour the group shown in the cut was formed. Nineteen descendants of hers are shown, but
these are by no means all. Most of these, as may be seen, are grandchildren.
The Melendrez fami y eat meat mostly, with corn, chiles, melons and such licht stuff as can be raised without too much
toil. So the cattle on Â« thousand hills are not too numerous to feed the rapidly multiplying mouths.
One of the Senora's boys, Jesus, is an outlaw, he having killed a neighbor in' a brawl over a cow. He is somewhere at
large on the peninsula ana has avoided capture for five or six years. Bu: all the others are law-abiding and inoffensive as the
': cuttle tbey herd.

ynorance *7s the Obstacle
i y Tfow to *%Â° Overcome.
DR. JEROME A. ANDERSON.
President of the Theosophists' Association of California and editor of the Pacific
Theosophist.
The object of human life appears to be the perfecting of human character.
The soul of man, in common with that of all nature, is undergoing an evolution
ary process with, in his case, this specific object in view rise above the animal
into a really human condition. The problem of life, then, for the race as well as
for each individual member thereof, is to accomplish this with the least amount
of suffering and injustice. Happiness (or bliss) is the goal for which we are ail,
consciously or unconsciously, striving.
Ignoranc- is the great and sole obstacle to be overcome. Men must bo taught
S higher conceptions of life. They must be made to feel in their hearts that ln true
brotherhood lies their only hope. They must realize this from the very depths
of their souls; a mere intellectual concept will do no good. They must feel
that the wrong of one is the concern of all: that he who seeks his own selfish
happiness is a moral fratricide. This is or ought to be the lesson of all religion
and all philosophy; but tbe one is so hampered by foolish dogma and the other
by even more foolishly materialistic speculation that they have failed in the
- past aud must continue to fail in the future to bring about even a semblance of
happiness.
This world i 3 governed in every department, whether physically or mentally,
ty the law of cause and effect. Each man's destiny is in his own hands and he
cannot possibly, by forgiveness or in any otner way, escape the consequences of
his own acts. His .present condition, nowever unhappy it may be, is the result
of his own past errors in former lives. Men cannot be made better or \ more
, humane by la.v; nor can they be made just by Inculcating any foolish dogma
concerning rewards and punishments in a heaven or hell of which they know
little and believe less. We want to be practical; to show men' that here and now
they are undergoing their rewards or punishments, and that this will always be
the case; the happiness or unhappiness being determined by themselves in every
instance under the law 01 cause and effect. If we can bring this simple teaching
home to the hearts of men, the problem of life will have been solved; the false
ideals, the iuhnm is competition, the mad, murderous longings for wealth, fame
or power will die out, aud in their place will come a larger, broader, more divine
view of human liie, which will usher in the new civilization of universal
brotherhood. !' 7-

â¢ He who spake as never man spake, said, "I am the way, the truth and the
life." And the prophet said that the Lord tequires that we should "Do justly,
love mercy and walk humbly." This would seem to be the embodiment of the
golden ruie to "Do unto others as we would have others do unto us." The true
way to live is in strict obedience to the laws of God and the laws of health and
true to one's self. Shakespeare-said: "This above all to tnine own self be true.
And it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any
man." .' proper start in life is the most essential thing in the matter of right
living. The man of Nazareth should be the standard of all real life, in which
there is neither fiction, ideal nor Impossible attainment. ] To seek him and make
his teachings the rule and practice of life must be the best way to live.
How to find that way is not difficult, for whosoever will do his will "shall
know of the doctrine."
Among the essential things to be desired in the solution of the problem of life
is good healthâ richest blessingâ and we should see well to it that this gift
is not abused; followed by a liberal education, which every man should seek,
and for the neglect of which there would seem to be little excuse, for the hum
blest may obtain it ia this day and generation. Economy in life should not be
overlooked, and whoever is a spendthrift will ever be in want.
The world is looking for men who can do something and competent to do that
something well, and the man who respects himself will have the respect of others
and the problem of life be more easily solved.

One cannot solve the problem by the exact laws of mathematics, but there
are a few rules of experience which will, if judiciously applied, bring the greatest
measure of contentment. After all, ''contentment is riches," therefore let one
seek the way to be contented.- Let not ambition, vanity or hobbies keep one from
being contented with a great deal less than he thinks he deserves. Great wealth
or high honors mnst frequently bring their possessors more trouble than
happiness. Work of some kind is essential to true happiness even among the
very wealthy.

Will Begin Work Early
Next Month-
Underground Wires Will Be

The Competition Will Tak3 Eff ct
January I, 1898 -Hostile L-gis
latioi Was Defeated.
'"â  i .
Active work in the construction of the
lines and conduits of the People's Mutual
Telephone Company will Degin early next
month. Under the terms of the franchise
granted five months since the company
must within one year from the date of the
grant expend at least $100,003 in con
struction work, independent of the pur
chases of real estate.
At the office of the 'company yesterday
the managers stated tbat the requisite
1 number of contracts had been obtained to
justify the company in going ahead with
the work.
The franchise, which is a valuable one,
giving the company the right to place
conduits in any street or alley of the City,
was not obtained without considerable op
position. The promoters of the new en
terprise were harassed for many months
by a person who had been a jobber or
broker in franchises obtained in Los An
geles and other place*. He was so per
sistent and meddlesome in his opposition
that the impression was formed that some
rival institution had hired him to ob
struct ihe grant of the franchise.- At a
time when he seemed about to accomplish
his plan of obstruction, he was exposed
in the Board of Supervisors by Adolph B.
Spreckels, who was then chairman of the
Street Committee of the board, and the
franchise was obtained by the company.
At Sacramento during the session of the
last Legislature the same enemy of the
competing company, whose plans was
frustrated in San "Francisco, sought to ob
tain legislation which would have greatly
embarrassed the owners of the franchise.
General Robert A. Freidrich was advised
of this person's presence at Sacramento
and at once went before the Assembly
Committee on Corporations and exposed
the scheme. The result of the exposure
was the defeat of the hostile design." Gen
eral Freidrich was astonished when he
reached Sacramento to find that the irre
sponsible hawker of franchises, whose lack
of character and standing in the commer
cial community had been so thoroughly
and openly exposed by Supervisor
Spreckels, had managed to commend him
self to the good graces of the Sutter Club
of that city.
When the competing line is in operation
the people as well as the City will have a
comparatively cbeap service. "Under the
franchise the maximum rate which the
company can charge is $3 per month for a
telephone and 3 cents a switch. The old
company under its franchise is permitted
to charge as high as $5 per month and 5
cents a switch, although a much lower
rate has been established in anticipation
of competition.
Under the provisions of the franchise
granted to the new company, the City is
to have one duct or system of wires in :
each conduit free of charge; and more
over the company is obliged to pay the
City 2 per cent of its gross earnings. It is
required by the franchise that the com
pany must always maintain competitive
service.
The new line, according to the grant,
must be in operation to soni'- extent as
early as January 1, 1898. So the work of
building must be active from this time
forward.
The first work will probably be along
Mission and Market streets. In order to
introduce long-distance facilities and
connect with other towns, particularly
San Jose, with as little delay as possible,
much suburban work wiil be done in
putting in poles and stringing wires. For
service in San Francisco the underground
system is to be adopted.
It is said by the management of the
company that there will be no trouble in
securing first-class instruments and mod
ern switchboard appliances. Recently
old-established companies In Eastern
cities have expended as much as $100,000
each to secure all the modern improve
ments in switchboards. The appliances
which the competing company will intro
duce are to be thoroughly tested in prac
tical operation. n^
A VARIANCE IN THEIR TALE&
Dr. Bliss' and Cleaves' Account of
j Their Trouble.
! In connection witb the trouble between
Dr. F. A. Bliss and' M. C. Cleaves on the

each man has a tale to tell, and tbey differ

Dr.* Bliss says he never saw Cleaves be

sent an attorney to him with the request
that he call at the attorney's office and

was dissatisfied with the work done and
would not pay the full amount of the
bill, $27.-: v:7
Bliss then agreed to reduce it to $20,
whereupon, he claims. Cleaves produced a
revolver and made him sign a receipt for
the amount in full.
Then, he says, when Cleave* was leav
ing and both hands were engaged in open
ing the door, he grappled with the South
ern Pacific clerk and secured the revolver
just as help arrived.
Cleaves, however, states that when he
refused to pay Bliss the full amount of the
b 11 the dentist tried to make him do so
with a revolver, and they were struggling
fort possession of it when Dr. Bell. and
the janitor arrived.
The receipt, which Dr. Bliss states
Cleaves dropped during the strugcle, is
now said to be in evidence to prove the
truth ot Bliss' assertion.
SHOT AT HER HUSBAND.
Mrs- Nina Power- Charged With As
sault to Murder.
Mrs. Nina .Powers was arrested early
yesterday morning in a lodging-house at
33 Sixth street on the charge of assault
to murder. She was taken before Judge
Campbell yesterday and the case was con
tinued till Tuesday. The Judge fixed her
bonds at $1030, as he was inclined to be
lieve there was not sufficient cause for
the arrest.
Mrs. Powers is 27 years of age and of
attractive appearance. She admitted that
sue had a quarrel with her husband and
that he began to abuse her, and a revolver
was accidentally discharged.
"About a year ago," she said, "we
started west from Denver and settled first
in Arizona, but may husband was not sat
isfied so we removed to San Diego. He
was not successiul in securing employ
ment, so we came here and went to live at
33 Sixth street.
"Day by. day I saw our little money go
ing to 'he sharpers and I did all I could
to induce him to reform. He promised to
amend his ways, but yesterday be went
out again and late last night be came
home very drunk, having spent $70.
When I remonstrated with him he became
abusive, took what money he had left out
of his pocket and threw it on the floor.
Then we had a fuss, but I did not try to
shoot him. " ' â¢ V
THE TRUCKEE RIVER FISH
They Will Be Protected From
Destruction B.low the
Sawmills.
The Supreme Court Says That Damp*
ing Sawdust in a Stream Is a
Public Nuisancj.
A very important decision was handed
down by the State Supreme Court yester
day in the case against the Truckee Lum
ber Company. For years past the Fish
Commissioners have been doing all 'in
their power to stock the streams of the
State with food and game fish. The natu
ral enemies of the fresh water streams of
California are numerous. . Added to these
are the fellows who kill fish with dyna
mite and others who take fish in and out
of season without regard to the law.
Nor are these all, for the destruction' of
fish in streams by the pollution of the
waters by decomposing sawdust, edgings
and slabs is so great that many fine trout
streams are completely ruined for fishing
- purposes. There is plenty of law on this
subject requiring the owners of sawmi
to d.spose of the refuse of the mills other
wise than by dumping it into the brooks
and creeks; but it has seemea almost im
possible to accomplish the desired end.
Among- the large trout streams is the
Truckee River, that rises in Lake Taboe,
Hows through the eastern part ot Cali
fornia and empties into. Pyramid Lake, in
the State of Nevada. For years there
was no better fishing ground in the West,

The Truckee Lumber . Company estab
lished its mill on the bank of the river in
Nevada County, and ran all of its refuse
into the stream, completely polluting the
waters and killing tisti by the wholesale.
The California Fisu Commissioners,
thr ugh the Attorney-General's office, de
cide to put a stop to this wholesale de
struction of fish, and brought an action in
Nevada County, enjoining the company
from dumping its sawdust and other ref
use into the Tiuckee River, on the ground
that it was a public nuisance. It wa3 an
important question for the court to de
cide â whether the killing of fish in a fresh
water unnavigable stream could be con
strued as a public nuisance. The injunc
tion was granted, and rrom ti.e order for
the injunction the lumber company took
an appeal to the Supreme Court.
The lumber company took the position
that the reasons set forth in the com
plaint were not sufficient for a cause of
action, and that under the circumstances
nopublic nuisance was being committed.
The Supreme Court after reviewing the
case decided that the order for the perma
nent injunction should be affirmed. The
Fish Commissioners regard this as a de
cided victory, and it ia likely . that many
similar actions will be brought in order to
protect the fish in the freshwater streams
now rendered positively filthy by beings
pumping-ground for sawmills.
Three Divorces Granted.
Nellie Smith has been granted a divorce
from William H. Smith for wilful neglect, with
an allowance of $15 a month allmonv. Rose

PREPARING FOR
"MALEDICTION"
Grand Entertainment to Be
Given by the Gentle
men's Sodality.
Ia the Present Greek Crisis,
the Plot Is of Spec
Interest.
On April 28 the Varied Programme
Will B. Given at the College
Hall.
Tbe Gentlemen's Sodality attached to
St. Ignatius Church, whose membership
counts up near the thousand, composed of
many graduates of the Jesuit colleges of
St. Ignatius and Santa Clara, as well as
gentlemen from every part of the City, in
tend giving their annual celebration, con
sisting of a grand dramatic and high-class
musical entertainment, at the large col
lege hall, Van Ness avenue, on Wednes
day evening, April 28, and it is safe to say,
from the elaborate preparations by the
members of the dramatic and philhar
monic society attached to tbe sodality,
that it will surpass anything produced by
them previously. v.'.;
Tne drama chosen for the occasion,
entitled "The* Malediction," has three
acts and is a translation from the' French
by Joseph A. Lyons, A.M., and is adapted
for male characters only. It will be in
teresting at the present juncture, when
the Greeks are upholding Christianity
against Mohammedanism, that the plot of
the play to bo produced is laid in Spain,
during the Mohammedan war. Don Alonzo,
son of Don Vasco de Gomez, a princely
I nobleman, is persuaded by ambition and
the evil counsel of his conn i ant, Don
Lopez, to abandon bis. father, his country
and God. He becomes a prince among
the Mohammedans, and in the prog
ress of the war his father and all
his soldiers fall into the hands of Tarik,
the Mohammedan leader. Tarik commands
Don Alonzo to visit bis father and en
deavor to win him to the- faith of tbe
prophet, assuring him, if he fails, his
father shall die. Alonzo obeys; bis father
with righteous indignation repels him and
pronounces upon him a, terrible maledic
tion, beneath which he withers and loses
bis reason.
Don Vasco and his vassals escape from
the Turks and return to the . Christian
camp, where they find Don Alonzo, who,
under his father's care, returns: to reason
and is afterward killed in battle with the
Mohammedans. 7 Pedrillo, the peasant, is
a roan of many words,' but few actions.:
The play abounds in thrilling incidents.'

SEAWALL EXTENSION.
A Clear Statement of the Case by the
" Secretary of the Harbor Com
mission. '
Now that Braunhart's bill for a million
dollar appropriation in order to extend
the seawall has been vetoed by the Gov
ernor on the ground that it would require
advertising amounting to over $100,000,
and that this sum would have to come out
of the general lund of the State ( instead
of : tne harbor improvement fund, the
question has arisen: How is the seawall
to be extended, or are affairs to remain in
statu quo? Speaking ou the subject yes
terday the secretary yl the Harbor Com
mission said:
'â¢The Governor has seen fit to veto the
bill, , and that practically ends it. The
seawall will in future necessarily be ex
tended very slowly.
"If it were, not for the depot sinking
fond, which takes $55,000 annually out of
the appropriation, the commission would
be enabled to build about 1000 feet of sea
wall: every three years. 7 But wiih that
much of the aonropriation taken out and
the interest it is a hard matter, consider
ing other things," to do much improve
ment.
; "By other things, I mean repairing the
wall. . The .teredo is constantly working
havoc with: the piles and the sum that it
takes for repair- is very large. It .will- be
a long time before the seawall is extended
any great distance." 'J : '- t 'â ":' J

THALIA TREADWELL
HAS RETURNED
The Young Lady Has Come
Back to Look After
Business.
Was Studying Art in Paris, but
Her Heath Being Bad She
Went to London.
Something About the Scenes of On
Maurier's Writings and Eminent
Americans Now Abroad.
Miss Thalia Treadwell, the heiress and
daughter of the late James P. Treadwell,
an attorney of this City, has returned
here after two years' absence in Europe.
Miss Treadwell has been pursuing art
studies in Paris for some time, but finally
discontinued studying because ber health
was not good in Paris.:- -..â .:' 7.7 -r-r7 '"7-
Thereafter she visited Berlin, London
and leading capitals of Europe. Miss
Treadwell is very glad to be back.- She
has been at San Jose visiting . friends for
some days, and is now here to remain for
some time. - When she â¢â  goes to Europe
again, as she says, she will go by way of
Japan and India. ' â  77 7\ * 7>?7>'i
Miss Treadwell devoted herself to paint
ing while in Paris and was often at the
Louvre, where she met many, American
artists.. She also saw the many distin
guished persons of genius who used to be
the associates of Dv Maurier at the timo
he was writing "Trilby."
The lady referred to the sudden demise
of Miss Isabel Murphy, and adverted to
the Princess Colonna, now resident in
Italy.' , ,
. "I spent tbe winter m .London," said
she, "because I found after visiting Paris
that l could not stand the climate there.
I went back and forth several .times, but
each time when 1 reached Paris I became
ill. For this reason I gave up painting
nd returned to .London. My â ', home was
in one of the large hotels near the river
Thames, so that neither the fog nor smoke
was troublesome. Â:
"From London I visited Berlin and
Dresden, spending some time in the latter
city. It is one of the quaintest and most
interesting to me in all Europe. > 1 would
have attended the coronation of the Czar,
in fact had definitely settled to go. but just
at' that time some prominent friends de
sired me to visit them, so that I could not
get off to St N Petersburg. â 
"I crossed the Atlantic in the St. Paul,
which, as the dispatches announced, had
a hard trip, and I finally reached here in
exactly, two years to a day from the tint

setting out for another trip abroad.''
Miss Treadwell baa returned to Califor

CRIMINALS SENTENCED.
Judge Dunne Meted Out Condign Pun-
Ishraeitt to Convicted Felons.
Judge F. H. Dunne held an interesting
session in Department 11 cf the Superior
Court yesterday morning. His Honor had
before him the usual number of convicted
felons waiting to receive the judical de
cree touching the punishment to which
they were entitled.
Lee Ah Louie was the star attraction in
this aggregation of hard characters. He
was tried on a charge of murder, but the
jury listened to the able argument of his
attorney, J. E. Richards, and let him off
w.th a verdict of manslaughter. He was
sentenced to serve ten years at hard labor
in the State prison at San Quentiu.
Lon Yek, Lee Kong and Lee Sang, a trio
of highbinders convicted ot robbery, were
consigned to the Folsom State prison for
ten years each.* "\:X
William Hogan, who committed grand
larceny, was sentenced to stripes in San
Qientin for seven years, and Louis Seis
escaped with a term of eighteen months
at San Quentin because he pleaded guilty
to the cuarge of forgery instead of putting
the State to the trouble and expense of a
trial.
It is getting to be the custom when a
criminal knows that he has a strong case
against him to plead guilty and throw
himself on the mercy of the court. By
j this means the term of imprisonment
I may be appreciably diminished.
Judge Dunne's dock was full of other
criminals who were produced; in court for
I arraignment, for pleading or for other
1 preliminary proceedings.
As usual, the majority of these wicked
ones were young men, and some of them
were boys, with the down of adolescence
on their chins and with the bloom of
I childhood scarcely brushed from their
j ro y chesks by the, erosive influences of
I want and crime. 77,.
j Many charitable organizations in this
City are at work in different departments
of Christian endeavor, but the crop of
,boy criminals never fails, and very little
seems to be attempted for foreguarding
â  the boys of the City against the tempta
tions that, if not avoided, inevitably lead
j to the dock of tbe criminal courts and

Hia Wardrobe Was In the Height of
Fashion, but It Cause* Legal
Â;â¢-; Difficulties.
Abont nine months aeo Milton D. Gar
rett of W. D. Garrett & Co. concluded that
his wardrobe needed replenishing and he
decided to do the job thoroughly while he
was about it. He eot his new outfit all

Company. 7..7?*; 1 7V-7
A dress suit was a necessity," of course,
and ne contracted to pay $85 for that.
Tuxedo coats were in fashion at the time
and a. $50 garment was added to the list.
Mr. Garrett was of the opinion that no
gentleman should be without three busi
ness suits, so he ordered three sack suits
at $50 per suit. Cleaning and repairing
added $2 50 to the bill, and Mr. Curley
claims that $287 50 was owing.
All of this indebtedness was incurred in
July and August, 1896. and though bills
were frequently rendered Mr. Garrett, he
failed to liquidate. Suit for the amount
was begun yesterday.

The prompt action of the Spanish Gov

ecution of Rivera is a clear evidence that
it h_s studied American politics to some
advantage and knows what the change of
administration means.

The Alnmeda Encinal gravely remarks
that The Call's prowling after the new

bit. The circumstance that it has rattled
the Enciiial has evidently been overlooked.
Since Spain has gained some successes

The poets of England who are imitating
Byron by writing odes in favor of Greece,

.
Alarmed by the signs of the timet all
around her, San Rafael purposes to pre
clude the evils of bad municipal govern

club before the bad government has ar
rived. There is much virtue in "a stitch
in time."
The bombardment of the Greek camp
by the blockading fleet; off the coast of
â¢ Crete without any declaration of war
seems to imply that diplomacy has dis
covered a way by which it can put an end
to all wars in Europe without in any way
interfering with fighting.

The clause which declares the tariff bill

be invalid, but all the same it will
make the importers hesitate about bring

the hesitation is all that is needed. Any

Southern California .has begun making

The retirement of the Liberal Ministry
In Anstria may mean a new crisis, or only
a new complication of an old one, but in

loosely held together to withstand much

Some enterprising /car- builders, in the
East propose to unite their energies to
construct for the use oi the President the
finest car ever seen on the globe, and it is
to be hoped they will carry out the plan.
The President of the United State ought
to spend a gocd deal of his time traveling,
and for that reason snould have a' state
car which will make it comfortable for
him when he does it. * '
An Antioch paper quotes from the Lin
coln News-Messenger the fact that the pot
tery at Lincoln is shipping ware at the
rate of two carloads per day, and supple
ments the quotation with the gloomy re
flection that in Antioch it is a "shame
that things are as they ore at our pottery. 1 '
From which the reasonable inference is
that Antioch would be cheered by an evi
dence of more pottery and less pottering'
at its clay-molding establishment.
THE FATE OF RIVERA.
Until tbe fate of Rivera is settled, American interest in Cuban affairs will be at a
high degree of intensity. Public sentiment in this country bas long demanded that
the Cuban patriots should be treated as prisoners of war, and now that the life of a
distinguished leader is at stake to .ive a personal phase to the abstract question that
sentiment will rapidly increase in force*and fervor.'
It seems clear tbat in this instance the American Government has a good occasion
and a just cause for intervening and demanding of the Spanish Government the
recognition of the Cubans as* soldiers entitled to belligerent rights. It is certain that
if Rivera is executed, the Cubans will be moved to retaliation upon all Spanish
prisoners who may fall into their hands, and the war will become a struggle for exter
mination. The United States cannot consent to such an outrage against civilization
and humanity to be perpetrated in an island so near Its borders, and it becomes a
duty, tberefore, that we should exercise all necessary power to prevent it.
It is not too much to say that if Rivera is executed the shot which kills him will
be the shot which establishes the independence of the Cuban Republic.: It will ba the
final cruelty on the part of Spain necessary to rouse American indignation to swift
action. The people of this country have learned to respect Rivera, not merely for his
cause, but for his personal courage, patriotism and generalship. His noble words
spoken in captivity excite both sympathy and admiration. His disregard for his per
sonal welfare, taken in connection with his earnest loyalty to Cuba, show him to be
the stuff out of which caD be made a martyr as well as a hero. He is willing to go to
the scaffold as well as to the battle-held, if by so doing he can advance the cause of
his country. Such a man cannot be executed as a criminal with impunity.
It will be well for Spain if she gives heed to the sentiments of the* American peo
pie and the representations of the American Government on this' issue. â¢ Rivera must
be treated- as a prisoner of war. Woe be to Spain if she defies civilization and pun
ishes with death this valiant leader of a noble people struggling for independence.' -"â¢'*
BALBOA ROAD.
The suggestion of Mayor Phelan that
the new Doulevard snail be called Balboa
road is a most felicitous one. The name
is in every sense appropriate. . It is short,
beautiful and historic. It can be readily
spoken and will serve as a well-merited
monument to one of the most gifted, gal
lant and famous of that band of adven
turers who discovered and explored Amer
ica in the days of the Spanish conquest.
Vasco Nunez de Balboa was a remark
able man in many ways. None of the
Spanish adventurers of his time were
equal to him in breadth of intellect
or nobility of character. While to
most of them America was simply a'
land of gold" and romantic adven
ture, it was to him a veritable new
world, out of which great things were to
be made for humanity. Where others
were cruel to the natives, he was just, gen
erous and' magnanimous. Where others
sought merely for wealth and power, he
sought to widen the bounds of knowledge
concerning the new continent and to lay
broad and deep the foundations of new em
pires.
It was given to him to be tbe first Eu
ropean to see the Pacific Ocean, and he
was also the first to embark upon ii and
begin the exploration of its waters. It is
altogether right and proper, therefore, ,
that in a city which is destined to be the
great metropolis of the Pacific Ocean
trade there should be some monument to
commemorate the fame of his discovery
and do honor to bis illustrious name. It
is most fitting, moreover, that tbe monu
ment should lake the form of a grand
avenue leading to the ocean which he was
first to discover. The name, therefore, is
thoroughly appropriate in every way and
will be cordially adopted by the people.
Now that the avenue has been well
started and well named it remains to see
tbat the work of constructing it is carried
forward with sufficient vigor to bring
about its completion without delay. Sub
scriptions in the past have been liberal,
but they have not been sufficient for the i
work. More money is needed. This
should be donated during the coming
week. Let us see to it, that our Balboa
road is carried forward with an energy
worthy of the people whose City it is to
adorn and of the great man whose name
it bears. . , .. -* ..
lOEEIGN TRADE METHODS.
In the United States consular reports for
Marcb there are articles of more than or
dinary interest to our merchants and pro
ducers concerning the proper method to
build up a foreign trade, and contrasting
the defects of American efforts in that
direction with the weli-nigh world-wide
success of the Germans. These men are
not merely theorizing about what we
shonld do, they pointout facts well known
to them as object lessons for our study.
The trouble is that American methods
of home trading are not applied to. the en
terprise of foreign extension.. Big com
mercial houses- here build up and main
tain a large trade by arranging for direct
contact with their customers through
their representatives who travel with sam
ples. This method is far more necessary
in foreign trade relations than in domestic,
but according to our Consuls it is neglected
and futile attempts are continually made
to accomplish rich results by cheap plans
of circular distributionâ the said circulars
in many cases not even being written in
the language of the people to whom they
are sent.
The Germans, on the other hand, send
out agents all over the face of the globeâ
into South Africa, among the Balkan
States, into China and Japan, with Chi
nese agents educated in commerce and in
European languages, and are outdoing us
even as close home as Central America,
where they adapt themselves to the pack
mule trade of the almost inaccessible iar
interior. The business of. the agents is to
study the trade needs of the different
people and learn to supply them. * The
results of their enterprise 'are ample to
demonstrate the practical wisdom of their
way of doing business.
The Consuls' reports show there is an
abundant desire to enlarge American trade
with foreign countries, but the means em
ployed are in most cases absurdly inade
ouate. It is quite a frequent occurrence
for the Consuls to receive requests to act
as -gen is lor the would- exporters, who
thereby show a strange ignorance of offi
cial duties. Another error pointed out is
that of trying to establish an export trade
through the medium of commission
houses in the large seaport;' towns. Â»The
effect oi this - is': to greatly' increase the
price to consumers; and, to' give to the
goods the evil reputation of often being
stale, dry, etc.
The main impediment in the way of
adopting the direct-contact-with-custom
ers method is the immense cost of 'travel
and the risk of experimenting. in new
fields. But this can be overcome by the :
forming of export associations. -Thus the
expense can be so divided as to make the
cost to each member but a trifle in pro
portion to the possible profits of opening
up new business. A few of these associa
tions have been formed in â¢ the' East and
are doing good work. It is not a question
of trying a uew experiment, but of extend
ing a system found successful. Several of
these export associations might be formed
in California to the great advantage of the
members and to the general prosperity of
the State.
It is announced tbat , there will be a
congress of Greek women held at Athens
during this month to consider reforms in
education and dress, and it is believed a
strong effort will be [made to revive I the
classic Greek costume in preference to
that of Paris. 'Â« If the movement succeeds
Athens will swing her ancient style again
and lead the world in : beauty aud , grace.*
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
A SPLENDID INSTITUTION.
The last bill which â¢ Governor Budd
signed among the lot which he received
from the recent session of the Legislature
was one for the appropriation of $56,000
for improvements at the Preston Reform
School in Amador County.. This is one of
the worthiest objects of legislative aid
that came up for attention. As but little
seems to be known about the school,
which is a remarkably extensive and pre
tentious institution, some general .in
formation concerning its situation, pur- ;
poses and development may prove inter
esting.
The most striking feature is - the odd ;
circumstance of finding so imposing an
edifice in that part of the. country, for it
is not in any town, but stands rieht in the
thick of a wide growth of chaparral and
manzanita on a hillside as rugged and
wild as the Sierra foothills can afford any
where.
Driving from the pretty little city of
lone, which is the only railroad town in
the county, the visitor conies upon the
large, modern-built, red-brick structure as
Aladdin might have come upon the magi
cal castle after rubbing his lamp. The
contrast between the school and its sur
roundings is so vivid as to linger with the
visitor long after be has turned his back
upon it. 77** 7
The Preston School is a State institu
tion, built by legislative enactment and

wherein are enrolled those who are mili

COLONEL VASSOS.
With every new report from Europe it
becomes more evident that King George
of Greece chose well when he sent Colonel
Vassos- to take command of the Greek
army of occupation in Cret?. Tried and
tested by a thousand difficulties, Vassos
has shown himself superior to all of them.
He has maintained his position and not
only avoided giving any reasonable ex
cuse to the powers for interfering, but has
actually managed to put them in the
wrong and to achieve diplomatic victories
even more important than his military
successes over the Turkish garrisons.
In a statement recently made to a corre
spondent of the London Telegraph Colonel
Vassos was able to point out that be has
quieted the entire Christian population in
the interior of the island, while the ad
mirals of the powers have not succeeded
in keeping the peace in the ports they
have blockaded. Throughout Crete the
Greek army has repressed every form of
crime, made life and property a* secure as
it is in France or England, has estab
lished hospitals for the sick and wounded
not only among the Greeks but among the
Moslems, and has won the sympathy,
confidence and support of nil classes of
people. Not the slightest outbreak lias
occurred in the island to give the powers
occasion for landing troops. He has in
effect established Greek rule over the
country, and there is no sign of war "any
where except around- those ports where
tbe allied fleets are stationed.
As a further evidence of his fitness for
the position Colonel Vassos has returned
to the Turks certain officers of their army
whom he had captured. By doing this be
rids himself of the trouble of keeping
prisoners and also sets an example of ;
liberality and generosity â '. which cannot
fail to win him the favor of the world. In
fact every step that he has taken has
served to strengthen his hold upon public
opinion, aud he enjoys at- this time the
-confidence not only of bis own Govern
ment and of tbe Cretan people, but of the
intelligence of Europe. He manages to
take -very step in hi-* difficult course in
such a way as to qpnvince tne world that
he is right and that his opponents are
wrong. He is eminently the right man
for the place, and if Greece succeeds in
winning her fight and annexing Crete to
her dominions King George can hardly do
better than to* recognize and repay the
services of Vassos by making him Gov
ernor of the island.
TALES IROM TEXAS.
. Texas being the biggest State in the
Union it Is natural to expect big. things
from that empire of the Lone' Star, and we
have some recent items of news from there
of a bigness which would . be surprising if
they came from any other source. Some
of these stories are vouched; for in such a
sober way that we must not doubt their
truth, but : others are so provocative of
skepticism that we will . have to demand
affidavits as to the- facts before we can
place our faith in them.
7 Among the stories within the bounds of
reason and deserving oar sober congratu
tion is this: .' A, planter of .'the : Caney
country states that he gathered four bales
of cotton, averaging 520 pounds, from one
and a quarter acres of land, and this was
not ' under the most-" favorable clrcum
stances, for he lost one- fifth of the crop on
account of rainy weather. This is equal to
four bales of the good average size of 416
pounds from a single acre, and at a fair
price would return over a hundred dollars.''
It would be almost superfluous to wish for
a gold mine if one had : a plantation like
that. v 'â ; , .-â¢ Â.* ; 7
Another big story comes from Willis to
! the effect that 600 acres planted in Cuban
tobacco last year produced an average of
700 pounds. The price c was. 20 'cents a
pound and the tillage cost $50 a acre,
which left a net result of $160 an acre for
the producer.. From this it is evident that
if Spain and the Cuban patriots between
them utterly destroy the Queen of the An
tilles in their wrangling for, her posses
sion, the United States can look hopefully
to Texas for a continuation of | the luxury
of Cuban cigars. . . ,- . ..>...
Yet another tale in proper proportion
to the size. of .the Lone Star State is about
a plantation Called , Sugar. and. It is said
to be the largest in the United States and
covers 1200 acres. 7 Its yearly yield i
about 6.000,000 pounds" of sugar.' It is on
the Brazos. Other big plantations there,
make a joint production of 12,000,000
pounds.
Even Texas blight have been content
with sending ont three such stories in one
month, but sbe proceeds to' strain our
credulity with a fourth, which fairly stag
gers us with the contemplation of the
prosperity it makes possible if true, or
with the audacity of it if it is purely a
fake. â¢"_.'* ' " â¢"7".V -Â.-*;
The announcement is that fine fruit can
be produced by grafting' peaches, pears,
plums, apricots, eta, etc., upon the me_- ;
quite bush. Now if fine! fruit can be
gathered from that tough little tree that
grows wild and widespread over all the
'almost boundless acres of Western Texas,
and is drouth resisting, prairie fire defy
ing, proof against tearing winds and the
hurtle of hail big as ben eggs, then the,
fortune cf Texas is made.

ALLIANCES THAT HAVE FAILED.
i ln view of the discussion which is in
progress concerning the merits of the pro
jected treaty between the United States
and Great Britain,' it may be of interest to
cast a passing glance at the role which
international agreements of this character
have played in the past. Without in any
way wishing to depreciate the motives
that have prompted negotiations of the
convention now, before the United States
Senate, it may be' pointed out that past
experience shows that treaties are only
made to be broken, and that inasmuch as
the rupture frequently is accepted as a
casus' belli, they may be considered
on the. whole- as â '"'< conducive rather
to war than* to. ; peace..: True there
are some of the smaller nations of
Europe, such as for instance Switzerland,
and Belgium, as well as Luxemburg,
which are said to owe their existence and
their safety from invasion. to the inter
national treaties guaranteeing their neu
trality. But it may. be questioned whether
this respect of the latter is due no much to
the treaties as it is to the assurance enter
tained by the great powers that if any one
of their number attempts to infringe that
neutrality it will have to defend by force
of arms any advantage that it may have
secured thereby, certain of not being per
mitted to remain in undisputed possession
thereof. Treaties are only adhered to as ,
lone as it is to the interest of - the nations
who are parties to the agreement to do so,
and the only exception to the rule is that
of Italy, . which has involved itself in
i economic ruin for the sake of living un to
the terms and stipulations of its alliance
with Germany.
Thus the so-called lax Treaty of Paris
which marked. the close of the Crimean
war, and which was imposed upon Russia
by the victors, was only observed as long
as it suited the convenience of the Musco
vite Government, and was denounced by
the Czar's Chancellor, Prince Goricha
koff, in 1871, as soon as ever the defeat of
France by Germany had deprived the
former power of the possibility of resent
ing the breaking of the agr.ement.
Scarcely one of the stipulations of the in
ternational treaty which called -into ex
istence the Congo Free States has been ob
served by its sovereign, King Leopold of
Belgium/while the celebrated treaty at
Berlin of 1878 is in every sense of the word
a dead letter, hardly any of the signatory
powers having adhered to the solemn
promises and undertakings to which they
subscribed. *â  {] J [
Last year the indiscretion of Prince
Bismarck showed us how little reliance
could be placed upon the much-vaunted
Triple Alliance, since Germany at the very
time: when it was bound by the most sa
cred ties to a defensive and offensive
union with Anstria and Italy against
Russia and France had actually made a
secret agreement with the Czar behind
the back of her allies, while the recent I
difficulties in connection with Crete are
serving to call the attention of the world
to the fallacy of placing any dependence
upon the continuance of the treaty of alli
ance between Russia and France. In 1878
England made a treaty with Turkey,
by which in return for the ces
sion of the island of . Cyprus she ;
guaranteed the integrity of the Ottoman
empire, an undertaking which it is neither
politic or possible for her to fulfill. Russia
bound herself by treaty, in. the most sol
emn manner not to restore the fortifica- \
tions of the Black Sea port of Batoum, or i
to convert it into a naval: stronghold, in
spite of which ita defenses to-day rival
those of Portsmouth. France engaged
herself not to take possession of Tunis,
which in spite thereof has become one of
her colonial dependencies, while <!accord
ing to recent official reports published in I
London, there i* no doubt that Germany
has violated all the promises which she
made by treaty not to sell either spirits
or arms to the natives of Africa, especially
those engaged in slave-trading pursuits.
I could go on thus indefinitely. There
is not a single nation that has not to it- !
credit a large number of. treaties which |
it has failed to observe and of broken j
promises, while if Italy, as above mentioned, I
has achieved for herself a reputation for rare
honesty in having observed her obligations in '
connection -.villi the Triple Alliance at the ex- I
pense of her political and economic welfare, j
it is . ot from any question of principle, but
solely because King Humbert and his family
are so alarmed by the rapid growth of repub
licanism in his dominions that he looks more
to foreign alliances for the maintenance of his
tottering throne than to the loyalty of
his subjects. Save for this, the Triple Alliance
is, in the estimation of foreign statesmen, not I
worth the paper on which it is written.
Austria is well known to have been seeking, |
both at St. Petersburg,, at Bucharest and at
Belgrade, alliances in which Germany has no ;
part, while the feeling between Austria and
Italy is so bitter that it is ridiculous to im
agine for one instant that the one would ever â 
come to the rescue of the ether, treaty or^uo â¢
treaty. Indeed, the dream oi every patriotic
Italian is to wrest from Austria those of her
provinces that are populated by Italian-speak
ing races, and which are known throughout
Humbert's kingdom by the name' of "Italia
Irredenta." while in the same way Austrtans
are equally bent on recovering the city of
Venice, which they look upon as one of the I
lost and : vet brightest jewels of their Em
peror's crown. ; In fact, the two nations have
not one interest in common, political, histor
ical or economical. On the contrary, in each
of these particulars they are diametrically op
posed to one another. So it is | idle to believe
for one moment that they can ever be relied
upon to live up to the terms of the alliance by
which they are supposed to be bound to one
another. M^BB_S_M9BESBB9E>3^SK
. But the most striking illustration of the
wor thlessness of alliances, as far as the - per
manent binding together. of nations is con
cerned, is afforded , by the case oi France and
Russia.' Seldom has a great ' nation ' gone to
, such lengths or paid so heavily : to secure an
I alliance with a foreign power as has France in
I the case of Russia With the memories of the
j extravagant enthusiasm of the welcome ac
corded to the Czar and Czarina on the occa-
I sion of their stay on the banks of the Seine
I last autumn fresh in our minus, and our ears
j still ringing with .the echoes' of the nrofes
] slons of brotherhood in peace and In war
that were uttered both by President Carnot
and Emperor Nicholas, it certainly seems start
ling to find French statesmen and politicians,
as well as the Parisian: press, roundly con
demning the subserviency of the French Gov
ernment to St. Petersburg as, altogether un.
worthy of the dignity ot a nation wnich to
day ranks as one of the great powers and that
was at one time acknowledged to be the great
est of all. 1 Russia's foreign policy during the
past twelve - months * has ' undergone several
! chances altogether Inexplicable to Western
Europe, but which would certainly never have
been ordered unless destined to serve Muscovite
alms. On each occasion Russia has exacted
that France should follow blindly in her wake
without : knowing the why or j the wherefore,
until ;at length politicians and statesmen of
the eminence of M. de Lanessan and the
Count de Chaudery and others of equal weight
and prestige^ have been led to enter in the
press over their signatures the following pro
test: ['777 7" Z "â ''â  7 7.7' 'â ' V.-\ ~
"Russian , policy then .is on tbe eve of an
other change. Are we 'to* follow again " Is
our policy, to be tossed about at will,' to suit
the interests of Russia? Surely that, is a
course scarcely worthy of a nation of Prance's
rank.". 7 " 'â ' ' â  .. . Jj. ... N ',.
..These utterances were taken up by the St. Pe
tersburg newspapers which denounced the
Parisian newspapers that had published them
as Judeophlle," 'and â  reminded the French
people in a very patronizing manner that it
was Russia's friendship alone that had raised
France from the obscurity into which she had
sunk in 1870 to the rank of a first-class power.
Moreover, one ;of the leading '". officials
of the imperial treasury at St. Petersburg
undertook over his signature to demonstrate
to the world by means of a widely circulated
newspaper article that Russia had conferred a
very great favor and * benefit â¢ upon Fiance by
borrowing money from her. * It is a pity that
it is Impossible to reproduce* the article in
question here, since its logic and the in
geniousness of its arguments are character
istically Muscovite and Oriental that is to
say, plausible in the extreme. But ' the real,
truth of the matter is that while a few of the
leading financiers in France may have made
money by floating the loans which' Russia has
contracted at Paris, nearly the whole of the
enormous debt of the Muscovite empire is
held by Gallic investor.*, who have been
prompted by patriotic fervor rather than by
sound, sober judgment; to confide to Russia
the savings that had remained to them after
the payment of the terrible war indemnity to
Germany. It is probable that the war indem
nity will in the end prove to have been
the better investment of the two. * For the
milliards oÂ» francs, of which it consisted, have
long since returned, in j one way and another,
from Germany to France, with heavy interest,
whereas if the French continue to show them
selves restive to dictation from St. Petersburg
there is nothing to prevent the Muscovite
treasury from either arbitrarily reducing the
interest of its foreign debt, or else of following
the example of other Oriental governments in
repudiating it altogether. y. ;. .'...
; It may be pointed. out that the present
alliance between France and Russia is. the
fourth that has been contracted within the
last 100 years, and that each of the three
previous alliances has resulted not in peace
between the two contracting parties, but in
war. .The first. of these alliances bears the
date of 1797 and the signature of Czar Paul.
It was a treaty of alliance offensive
and defensive, yet the following year found
the French Marshal Massena inflicting a
crushing defeat at Zurich on a Russian army
commanded- by Prince pSouvarow. ? In 1807 a
fresh treaty of alliance was signed at Tilsitt,
and subsequently ratified at Erfurth by the
Emperors Napoleon and Alexander. Yet in
1812, that is to say - five years later, Napoleon
invaded' Russia at the head of the so-called
Grand Army, a campaign which culminated
in the disastrous retreat from Moscow. Then
came the Franco-Russian alliance of 1852,
which was followed two years later by a
French invasion of the Crimea.
According to the most authoritative state
ments the present treaty of alliance be
tween France and Russia, so long in
process of negotiation, was finally signed and
sealed during the visit of Emperor Nicholas to
Paris last autumn. How long will It be before,
in accordance with past precedent, France
and Russia are once more arrayed not side by
side as Iriends, but face to face as foes, the
animosity of the French being intensified a
hundredfold by the memory of the sacrifices
of money and dignity that they have made to
secure a friendship that is at the best Oriental,
and therefore perfidious and unreliable.
It has been stated above that the Franco-
Russian alliance was only completely and defi
nitely signed and sealed last autumn. But it
had been under way, so to speak, and in pro
cess of negotiation ever since 1887. For, con
trary to general belief, there was no
understanding of France with Russia prior to
that date, the French statesmen of the first fif
teen years of the third republic fighting dis
tinctly shy of any union with Russia. Indeed,
in the many conversations which I had about
the matter in 1879, 1880 and 1881 with
Gambetta, he invariably professed himself
as most strongly opposed thereto on the
ground that it was both illogical and impo
litic â illogical because there could be no
community of interest or ideas between the
absolutism and tyranny of the Orient and the
mest enlightened liberalism of the Occident;
impolitic because no Oriental could ever be
depended upon to subordinate his interests to
those of his European friends, and that an al
liance therefore between Russia and France
must Inevitably result in advantage to the
former and in detriment to the latter. " '
' The manner in which the understanding be
tween France and Russia was first brought
about in 1887 is sufficiently curious and un
known to be worthy of being placed on record.
King Leopold of Belgium has an illegitimate
son who is well known in Brussels, Baden,
Spa, Paris and at Monte Carlo as a great
gambler. One day he turned up at Paris and
called upon a gentleman of the name of M.
Foucamt de Mondion, who had, while
acting as tutor of the late Prince
de Cbiraay, the Minister of . Foreign
Affairs of Belgium, rendered such impor
tant services to the French Foreign Office in
the way of keeping the latter posted that after
leaving Brussels he was attached, to the de
partment on the Quai d'Orsay in a species of
undefined capacity. The Baron informed M.
de Mondion that he required at once a sum of
$50,000 to pay what he described as a "debt
of honor," failing which he. would bo obliged
to blow out his brains. Mondion of course de
clared that he was unable to lend him any
such sum, whereupon the Baron replied : â¢"I
know t.at. but you can procure it for me."
"How?" : . : - ij'ltJ.i
"Well. I have here in my possession docu
ments of the highest importance, authentic
proof that Prince Bismarck is playing a dou
ble game with Russia, and is fooling the Czar
all along the line, above all in the Bulgarian
question. The Czar believes that Bismarck is
acting frankly and loyally.' Here Is evidence
to the contrary. If France can show these
proof* of Bismarck's duplicity .. to Emperor
Alexander it means that Russia abandons her
alliance with Germany and Austria and will
probably contract a new union with France.''
Thereupon the Baron showed him the docu
ments which he had surreptitiously obtained
from tbe desk of his father. King .Leopold.
They comprised letters from Princess Clem
entine (mother of Prince Ferdinand of Bul
garia) and likewise letters from King Charles
of Roumania to his sister, the Countess of
Flanders, which she had handed to the King:
also letters from Prince Bismarck |to King
Charles and to Prince Clementine, which they
had forwarded to King Leopold.
"Mondion took the papers and showed them
to M. Lockroy, who was at that time a member
of the Uoblet Cabinet. At his request and at
that of his colleague, Minister of War Gen
eral Boulanger, the well-known Pans banker,
Hentsch, advanced the $50,000 demanded,
which was handed to the Baron.* *-'Y_
Six months later these papers were sent by
ex-Enibassndor-General Appert, a warm and
intimate friend of the Czar, to the latter at
Copenhagen.' The general showed them to
the Emperor, who for the first time became
aware of the duplicity of < Prince. Bismarck.
That was the beginning of the alliance between
France and Russia, which the Cretan crisis
bas now brought near to the breaking point,
since Russian sympathy is with - the Turkish
crescent, and French ; sympathy witn the
Greek cross. ...... ..';. Attache.
THE ITALIAN IDEA.

*_'.< the iNAfGURATioN OF McKinley.'.^-".*
La, Capital), Rome, Italy.
Some days ago" the United States was in
feast; it was the dawn of a new President.
Mr. Cleveland left the White House to cede it
to Mr. McKinley, who inherited at .the.- same
time all his prerogativesâ very
much envied in that country. It is at Wash
ington where this transmission of power takes
p place, and there is nothing more interesting
than this ceremony, which characterizes the
temperament of Americans, i: Â . â¢- ,-7 ;.
For eignt days the preparations were going
on with feverish activity; the trains were un
loading millions of passengers, coming from
the utmost points of this va-t country. 'As to
the hero ot tbe day, Mr. McKinlev, he was for
one week residing: with his family in a small
villa, away â  from the tumultuous crowd. He
profited by his last hours as a plain citizen by
meditating on the immense responsibi ity
which he was about to .assume. At all events
he wished to paÂ«s tranquilly the night of the
3d of March. Surrounded by his family, he
remained until 12 o'clock in his studio. Thurs
day, at the stroke of .12, ihe President-elect,
without uniform, without - pomp, . plainly
dressed in black, with silk l hat, walked to the
inaugural place to take the oaih of office.
J Nothing was -so .grand a? the parade which
characterized 'â¢ the -.- democracy â¢'- of America.
After - the inaugural address the " President,
having reviewed the troops, went on foot to

"AS ITHERS SEE US."
AMERICA and AMERICANSâ From â¢ French
I'ojnt of View. N*-wAork: Charles Scribner's
â -oiis For sale in this City by William Doxey,
r.-.lace Hotel. Price #138, Wj-^C
Once again, through the act of a mysterious
Providence and the enterprise of a New York
publishing-house, wo are enabled to view our
selves In a full-length mirror prepared for
our use by a stranger within our gates.
Scarcely recovered, in fact still convalescent,
from .a severe attack of Hawelsetis, we are
once more reduced to a condition in some re
spects similar by this prophet crying "Wool
woe I" in the accents of a veritable Solomon
. Eagle. RR_-_B8!
Our author professes to have written his
book in response to the urgent solicitations of
American friends. The notes from which his
work has been prepared are those such as any j
observant foreigner would make while on a
tour of the United State.-. He assures us that
no malice is intended, since there was naught
but kindness received by him during his two
visits to these shores. Albeit he evidently
sees jar less to admire in our institutions
than did either of his countrymen, Blouet
or -Bourget, and even less than the pessimistic
Ilaweis. He is apparently a man who has
taken particular note of the small things of
life. He is well traveled and constantly
makes reference to life in London, in Berlin
and in his native Paris. He compliments us
on one hand and unmercifully berates
us on the other. He launches forth into
denunciations and indulges in visions and
prophecies. His . final conclusion is ex
pressed in the idea that the American
people are a nation of contradictions.
Thus he arrives at New York harbor; he
is received at the landing by a villainously
attired and mannered omnibus-driver, who
charges him 15 francs lor a iwc-mile drive
ana 1 franc lor each extra piece of luggage he !
carries. The coaenman does not possess the '
euaviter in modo of tho Freuch cocker. Terri
ble! Affrcuxl! But there are compensations.
"You are ushered into the room engaged for
'you a: ihe hoiel in Fifth avenue. in a mo
ment the wharf, the hurly-burly are forgotten.
There are flowers on the table; there is a
bathroom done in tiles; there are soft carpets,
beautiful rugs, tasteful lurnlture, and the
. Figaro, Revue dcs Deux Mondes and Le Petit
Journal cut and on your table."
Our Frenchman's first impression is prob
.. ably derived from corporation rule as made
manifest in a wretched public service. The
cable-cars are overcrowded and th. sign
"Complet" is not displayed. Machinery Is
used to what is to him an incredible extent.
"Everything requiring nicety of mechanical
means, everything that can be done by steam
or electricity or gas, or by harnessing the
powers of nature, is done wellâ sometimes j
superlatively wellâ while anything demand- â¢.
ing personal service or the training, discipline J
and courtesy of men and women acting as
servants, in eitner a high or low capacity, is
done meanly, carelessly, irresponsibly, and
without any sense of honorable allegiance to
a master."
So democratic are we that we permit our
equalities to show themselves even in our
railway travel. The peripatetic tralnboy is
permitted to maintain a stand in a Pullman
car. Said tralnboy distributes literature and
bonbons without regard to the needs of his
' clients. Thus elderly gentleman receive
packages of chewing-gum, matrons copies of
sporting journals; editions of Zola or Paul de
Kock are presented to young girls; nurses
with infants are given apples or nuts and
' candy, for which the children cry when the
embryo merchant returns to collect them.
Our traveler marvels that tha good American
public stands this treatment under corporate
rule. In France, he says, "Such infringe
ments of the rights of the people to personal
comfort and personal dignity if persisted in
would result in revolution, and in London one
day of it would fill the next day's newspapers
with indignant protests and in a week's time
1 the matter would be under the control of the j
* police."
- In tbe instance quoted we catch a first j
glimpse of the author's faculty for eencraliz- I
iag. It seems strange* to the initiated that he, i
an apparently well-travelled man, should bo !
unaware of the overcrowding -which takes
place every day on the Underground Railway
in London, for instance. Hi claims that pro
test in America is useless, as the protestor is
unpopular here. There are too many people
interested, he finds, in keeping the people
slaves to permit any one to express dissent;
but what is true of New York in this regard
. may be said to apply with equal force to Lon
don. In any event it is a fact which will not
admit of dispute, that both the railway and
municipal car systems of this continent arc
Infinitely superior to anything that can be
found either in England or in Continental Eu
rope. Here at least one is not expected to
travel from Purls to Marseilles or to the Rivi
era deprived of even the commonest comforts
that are to be found in American local trains.
Our social life, the author of "America and
Ihe Americans," finds very unsatisfactory.
Wealth is the only standard and the average
American seems to dislike being alone. The
habit of dining out is a growing one and is
probably due to '.he servant question, which
rules here to a greater extent than in England.
A man with .$-000 per annum in New York is
badly off. He must keep up appearances and
servants. Tncse servants do not possess the
faithful characteristics of their compeers
abroad: They are wasteful and extravagant,
and a French family could live upon the food
that is thrown away by the middle-class
American.
Tnis Drings us very naturally to tho posi
tion of husband and wile in the American
household. The Oriental idea of woman being
the weaker vessel appears to be reversed In
America, thinks our author, and one of the
strangest political phenomena to him seems
to be the ceaseless agitation for women's
rights in the United States.
"Rights!" he exclaims, "Man Dicu! They
have rights, privilegas, autocracy in this
- country. Pray what more can they want? In
' Europe the wife takes the position of her hus-
V. band, but in the United States the husband
merely fits into the social exingencies of his
wife as best he can. * -No," he concludes, "had
I a young wife and daughters 1 should not
turn th.'m out for the summer at Saratoga or
Bar Harbor unless I were an American hus
band, in which case I should do as I were bid
and pay the bills."
From the husband and the wife to the chil
dren is but a step. Our author's opinion of the
â¢ American child is expressed in the heading to
his chapter dealing with the subject: "L'en
fant terrible" He notes that even in the mmd
of the American child there exists the same
plutocratic Ideas as in the parents. Like
lather like son, and you hear children in
chorus everywhere placing money values upon â¢
everything. Spoiled children in America are
the rule rather than the exception, and It is
only too apparent that the word "home" is
merely a figure of speech.
Apropos of this it is but meet to say that
there is much truth in the remark. The
writer of this review was staying for a few days
last summer at the Hotel Rafael. Taking a
constitutional and a cigar one evening at that
celebrated hostelry be overheard a child re
mark to her little playmate: "Oh, but we are
much richer than you are. We live in a cor
ner house while you live in the middle of the
block." The writer thougnt that here was a
good opportunity to read a little homily to the
child In question. He called her to him and
aÂ«ked: "Who told you. my dear, that it was
more fashionable to ; llvo in a corner house
â¢than in the middle of tbe block?" "Why, I
heard papa say-so." responded the child.
"Tell your papa," said he, "to be sure and se- I
lect a nice corner plat in the cemetery. He
will be mighty unfashlonab.e i. he doesn't."
There is one chapter in the work under
review to which' every thoughtful Ameri
can will say "Amen." It is that headed
"Class Distinctions,'.' and co tains some very
, pretty shots at'ihe fashionable preacher'
land the fashionable church. We arc told
I that the writer has â  seer, advertisements of
pens for Sale:- that preachers are retained,
in '.he service of congregations just so long
their teachings suit the ideas of their flocks;
that the popular preacher is judged by his !
"drawing power," as 'â  if he were a mounte
bank. Our author grows bitter when he
speaks of American commercialism Introduced
Into the house of God./ He. wonders whether'
we may not hear in lime of a â¢'corner in pews-"
and makes some quiet but noue the less sting
â -â¢-â¢â¢ â¢ â -'â¢ - . . I
ing comparisons between poor "Monsieur le
Cure" at home and the fashionable preacher
In this country.
Readers of the newspapers will recall the
humorous retort addressed by Mark Twain to
Paul Hourgec. who was reported to have said
that when the American had nothing else to
do he devoted himself to finding out who his
grandfather was; and the author oi "America
and the Americans"! cannot- resist making
passing reference to what may cc called the
grandfatherlessness of this country. He has
observed retired pork . butchers aud prosper
ous dry-goods merchants using coats-of-arms
upon their carriages and crests upon their
note piper, and he comments: "Pray, Mrs.
Sharp, Mrs. Green, Mrs. White, Mrs. Black,
Mrs. Jonesâ pray, where did your right to the
coronet, the crest and,' the coat-of-arms come
in? Do you even know, what the various
symbols, signs and figures mean? I have my
doubts, truly. And whyâ oh, whyâ you
want them at all?"
Of the American newspaper the author of
"America and the Americans" has not a very
exalted opinion, though he confesses that the
contrasts noted in other phases of American
existence are present here. He has no sooner
prepared to damn the new journalism when
he is tempted into praise by a dignified edi
torial in the Tribune, or a clever half column
in the Sun. His chief complaint seems to be
based upon our disregard of proportion and
lack of system, and he finds that trained,
traveled and capable men are not so numer
ous as In France, England or Germany. He
also traces back the pedigree of numerous
vices to the sensational American newspaper.
"My own conclusion," he says, "Is that unless
one happens upon such newspapers as the
Post, the Sun or the Tribune in New York, for
example, ho would be led to believe that the
copulation consisted of thugs, firebugs and
' bankrupts, who for some unaccountab.e rea-
I son spent large sums upon advertising."
Here again speaks the generalizes Having
compared the two, we may Barely say the
American press is neither better nor worse
than the French, though admittedly, not up
to tbe English standard in some respects.
But, gentle critic, have you never seen ex
hlblted in the kiosks of your beloved boule
vards publications which it would be a
penal offense to either sell or purchase in
this country? And. hence, have you never
heard of a littlo English proverb having refer
ence to people domiciled in glas* houses ?
If there is, one feature of the book before us
that is objectionable It is to be found in a cer
tain undercurrent of anti-Semitism permeat
ing the entire volume. There is really
neither wit nor humor in a statement to the
effect that the Mosaic spoiling of the Egyptians
continues with unabated vigor in New York
at the present day, and we can find matter ior
censure rather than for laughter in the re
mark that Delmonlco's restaurant at the
luncheon hour is a veritable synagogue. Jew
baiting at its best and clothed io its most at
tractive guise has always been a failure in this
country, and if our critic is what he Claims to
bsâ f. republican of republicans, with his
birthplace in Franceâ such expressions are, to
say the least, inconsistent.
It would be impossible within the limits of an
article like the present to even name the nu
merous good things to be found in "America
and the Americans." From Yankee humor to
Yankee cooks every phase and feature of our
life is touched upon in a bright, breezy and
entertaining manner. The majority of our
institutions are condemned, but, In the same
breath, our author finds some means of con
doning our faults. We are told in one chap
ter that we are too democratic, and in the
j next that wo are not democratic enough, so
I that the contradictions of American life, as
j observed by our author, are only equaled by
; those of his notes. We entertain hospitably,
; our climate is intoxicating, our peoDle op
timistic, the material wealth enormous; but
we are lar too lavish and profuse, aud, unless
jwe give heed in time, says this prophet,
| "I can see holders of Americin securities
lin Europe literally dumping them back
I upon the market here. I can see the social
I jealousies that the Americans either cannot or i
i will not see exchanging surly looks for rifles
I and frowns for gunpowder; and then I can see
j these 70,000,000 people in such a turbulent
| death struggle as will awe the world, even. the
j world which still hears the re-echoing shrieks
i and groans and laughter of our own revolu-
I tion. Thank G^d! you and I will not be there
| to see. Please God I it may be a false vision and
jI a mistaken prophet! But unless the people
i here who know and have, awaken to some sort
of sense of responsibility and the better class
of newspapers cease to tamper with the dyna
mite of c.ass prejudice trouble ls sure to
come." Emanuel elzas.

or sale by the Emporium Book and Stationery
Department. Saa . ranclsca
This dainty little volume, which contains
gems of sententious wisdom scarcely to be sur
passed by any writer save Solomon, is a re
print of the original edition published in
1597. It reproduces those quaint archaisms
which are so pleasing and which fasten the
attention upon the pithy sentences with a
stronger grip than when they are put in more
modern form.
Francis Bacon wrote it, and the print and
binding is a beautiful example of the book
maker's art. In introducing the book to the
public the author wrote in preface: "I doe
now publish my Essays; which all of my other
worke*, have beene most Currant: For that,
as it seemes, tney come home, to Mens Busi
uesse, and Bosomes. I have enlarged them,
both in Number, and Weight; So they are

The man who has practically made Ibsen known to English-speaking people is William Archer, the dramatic critic of
the London World. He has translated nearly every one of the master's plays, including the latest, "John Gabriel
Borkman." Mr. Archer is a Scotsman, and though many people may disagree with .him he is held in greater
esteem than perhaps any of his colleagues, because he is always in earnest and sincere. The above portrait is

The Atlantic.
The April number of the Atlantic Monthly
contains more than the. usual quantity of
purely literary matter which always dis
tinguishes it, and it has several articles also
of timeliness and practical interest. The
leading article is on "Dominant Forces in
the West." by Frederick J. Turner of Wis
consin, one cf the most competent students
of Western civilization. He points out the
origins of the people and their institu
tions and methods of thought, showing
that the Middle West hold* the balance
between the East and the Far West. Mr.
E. I- Godkin, this mouth, ln his studies ol
democracy in its practical aspects, shows the
serious weakness of .our political system
caused by our irresponsible nominative meth
ods. The breakdown of the machinery for
making nominations has defeated everything
like really representative government. The
gravest aanger to our political institutions is
found in this failure. Professor George B.
Adams of Yale sums up the "Anglo-Saxon
Expansion" of the' century and the world
dominance of the race in an eloquent and
comprehensive essay. _____________________B______B__E__9_p
There are three literary articles in the April
Atlantic of original interestâ "Mark Twain as
an -Interpreter of American Character," by
Charles Miner Thompson, who shows that the
secret of l the humorist-philosophers great
popularity and power lies really in the auto
biographic quality of his book; he is himself
a typical American. There is an interesting
comparison of Mark Twain and Abraham
Lincoln." Every reader of Kipling has
asked himself whether modern machinery
admits of poetical treatment. Mr. Arlo
Bates takes up this inquiry in on
article coiled "The Song .o' Steam,"
and concludes that machinery Itself is not
poetic, however impressive it may be. Fol
lowing Mr. Chapman's recent; article on
Emerson. H. D. Sedgwick Jr. writes- a valua
tion of | William Culleu Bryant' from the point
of view of the present. Of distinct literary
value is this month's installment of Colonel
Higginson's reminiscences on the "Birth ot
New England Llteratuie."
Maurice Thompson, poet and archer, whose
feats a-: a hunter with the .bow and arrow are
remarkable, describes a successful experience
in the Cherokee Hills. . : . 7.,-i.-;i
Following his article on Venus, Percival
Lowell, the astronomer, describes his recent
revolutionary " discoveries about ' the planet
Mercury. .
The Century. '
The April Century .is a "Grant memorial
number," signalizing the dedication* of Gen-"
er_l Grant's tomb. â â¢ General Horace Porter,
who was president of the citizens' association
that raised the money for this magnificent
memorial, %nd who will deliver the oration at
the dedication, contributes an article descrip
tive of the tomb and of its bullaing. A strik
ing drawing <,{ the tomb by Casta. guc is given
as a frontispiece. There are also pictures ot
the Interior (the only ones" yet made) and of
the figures for the facade designed by Sculptor
Rh!nd.i'lu "A . Blue and Gray Friendship."
John R. Proctor tells of the cum and affec
tion la which General. Buckner and General
Grant he.d each other ".for, years, and in con
nection with thi-i article there .â printed for
the first time a fac-simile reproduction of the
message Grunt, while on his deathbed, wrote
to General Buckner."- There is also given a fac
simile of Gram's most famous words, "I pro
pose tofigli* ii out on this line if it takes all
summer,", which were contained in a letter to
.General Halleck, and _ copy of a hitherto un
published letter , from General; Sherman," ex
pressing his frank opinion of Grant's charac
ter, p General- Porter's '. "Campaigning With :
Grant" 1 relates .a* number 'of ' new nnecdo
about his chief and tells of President Lincoln's
i flrst visit to the front. The other articles
give the usual variety to the num
ber. Dr. Mitchell's novel, "Hugh
! Wynne," introduces the picturesque figure of
| Major John Andre, and' gives n glimpse of
[ Washington in headquarters'. "Thackeray in
I Weimar," by Walter Volpius, describes the
j English humorist's friendly relations with
j Goethe's household and his interviews with
I the great poet. It is accompanied by a number
j 'of characteristic drawings by Thackeray never
I before printed. Richard Watson Gilder writes
| of --The Miracle of the Greek Fire," a remarka-
I ble ceremonial in the Church of the Holy
Sepu ichor at Jerusalem In Holy Week. This
I has timely interest from the attention now
! centering in. the Greek church in. the East,
i The beginning of a new serial by Mary Hart-
I well Catherwood, "The Days of Jeanne D'Arc,"
and the first of a series of illustrated papers by
Colonel George E. Waring, on "Mountain
Bicyllng in Europe," are given in the number.
Ladies' Home Journal.
The Easter number of The Ladies' Home
Journal is brimful of helpful and entertain
ing reading. "A Moravian Easter Dawn," by
Clifford Howard, tells the story of the
i simplest and most beautiful Easter service in
| America, as It ls given in the quaint and
â  picturesque town of Bethlehem, Pa. Ex
i President . Harrison's timely article de-
I scribes "The Social Life of the Presi
! dent," from the day of his inaugura
| tion, and gives interesting information, as to
receptions, dinners and ' other social events of
the White House. The popular series of
"Great Personal Events" is represented Dy
j "When Lafayette Rode Into Philadelphia," by
j Jean Fraley Hallowell, granddaughter of
one of the few surviving witnesses of the
I great Lafayette demonstration which cre
ated such furore nearly three-quarters
of a century ago. " Ira B. Snnkey has
written for ; this number a hymn, entitled
"The Beautiful Hills," with words -by John
H. Yates. -The. third illustration of Charles
Dana Gibson's series of character sketches of
"The People of Dickens" Is "Tom Pinch and
His Sister." Lovers of fiction will enjoy Je
rome K. Jerome's story, "A Portrait of a
Lady," and Herbert D. Ward's amusing serial,
"The Burglar Who Moved Paradise." A de.l
-cate tribute to tbe power and privilege of sis
terhood in the family is given in Rev. A. H.
Bradford's article on "The Woman Who Most
Influenced Me."
There seems to be no field of woman's life,
duties and interest not noted by the Journal.
There are practical views on vital questions
by Mr. Bok; literary talks by "Brocn"; sug
gestions on flowers and gardening by Eben
E. Rtxford; hints on amateur -photography;

Frank Leslie's.
Some notable articles, with the usual wealth
of illustrations, are given in the April number
of Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly. The most
Interesting paper, perhaps, is that on "The

gallant work of our surfmen. It contains
eighteen pictures of various wrecks, life
saving apparatus, groups of surfmen, por

In a letter to David Christie Murray, Mr. Kip
ling draws a strong distinction between long
and short works of fiction. Short stories are all
very well, he says, but the novel is Jhe higher
form, and no man under 40 can hope to write
a good one. The judgment is one with which
many readers will find themselves in instant
agreement-
Andrew Lang is catching it. one might say.
because he lound fault with Dickens' cricket.
If the immortal Pickwick had played golf,
then Mr. Lang might have laid down the law.
I When an able man, as is undoubtedly Mr.
Lang, gives opinions on all things from A to
Zâ ghosts and fly fishing includedâ he may
get bowled but or run out occasionally.
Constant are the discussions over the pro
nunciation of the name of Samuel Pepys. In
the Graphic of 1891 these verses are found:
, There are people, I'm toldâ noma say there are
j heaps â ..
Who speak of the talkative vnnel as Peeps;
And some so precise nod pedantic their step is
Who call the delightful eld riarist, Pepys:
But these I think right, and l follow their steps.
Ever mention the garrulous trosslp as Pepsi
The family name of Lot*- Chattenham being
Pep-pys and bisyllabic, it ls possible that the
true pronunciation may be discoverable.
. Andrew Lang has been sneering at what he
terms the "inexpensive pathos of Dickens."
Andrew Lang, living, may sneer; will Andrew
Lang, twenty-seven years dead, be remem
bered as Charles Dickens is to-day? Will his
writings be half bs widely read? Will his
name be then known to half, as many people
as will still be reading the writings of Charles
Dickens? Andrew Lang will be a myth long
before the '"inexpensive pathos" of Charles
Dickens has ceased to touch the hearts of the
lovers of English literature.
. It can no longer be truthfully said that an
American; book stands a poor chance for even
just notice or criticism in an English literary
paper. On the contraryâ perhaps
the Saturday Reviewâ the tone of criticism In
comment upon American literature is fair and
discriminating. In the London Aihenteum
there is this strongly commendatory notice of
S -rah Orne Jewell's "The Country of the
Pointed Fits" (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.): ',",."
--; "This Is - a. -very, favorable specimen of a
class of work In which American ladies
excel. It is a collection of studies, more
or/less consecutive, of life in an out-of-the
way fishing villageâ the experience of a long
summer holiday. An English reader must fail
to catch the exact flavor of the place described,''

drawn picture of human beings is attractive

original and vivid in presentment. It requires
some effort to realize the amount of artistic
skill which go. to the composition of -such: a

Greting to April.
Here she comes, tripping, smilingly
along!
What care we for the gentle showers
which hover over and around her?
See, bow she strews bright daisies along
the way. and how the tiny raindrops
glisten like diamonds in her sunlit hair.
Welcome! Thrice welcome, April; even
though thou art ever called fickle and in
constant!
Now as we bow before thee, we implore
thy royal highness to have pity upon us,
for cruelly we have been buffeted about by
old Father March.
Whew! How be blustered on his way;
holding high revels day and night with
bis faithful attendants, North Wind and
Jack Frost.
It in spite of the biting cold we dared to
poke our noses out of doors, the cruel old
fellow invariably sent us back, drenched
to the skin.
Then to think of how he dishonored
the familiar adage, "March comes in lite
a lion and goes out like a lamb." This
year he stayed lite a lion and went out
liKe a lion, roaring to the very last. So
we're glad that he has gone and once
again welcome you, 0! fair first month of
spring !

The Name of Our
New Month.
"April" is from the word "Aperilis,"
meaning "opening," or "when the earth
opens its mouth," as this season *is the
birthtime of foliage, flowers and all the
living things of spring.
First of April.
The observance of this day as a time for
fun is a very old "custom, and its origin is
still wrapped to some extent in mystery.
Not alone tins April Fool's day been cel
ebrated in England and America, but
hundreds of years ago in far-away Ilin
dostan we find that on a certain day peo
ple were sent on fruitless errands and de
ceived by false promises, and the Japanese
also were wont to present useless and
foolish gifts on a day in early spring, or to
send others on foolish errands.
April's Stone
and Flowey.
â¢ The brilliant diamond, April's stone, is
the most valuable of all the gems of the
mineral world.- Its sentiment is "inno
cence," as is also that of April's flower,
the modest, delicately colored daisy.
Monkey, Pony
and Bow-wow.
Once upon a time a Monkey, a Pony
! and a Bow-wow ran a race for some prizes.
The one who won the race was to get a
stick of candy. The one who got in last
was to get a tin Whistle. The one who
got in second was to receive nothing at ail.
' All three stood in a row. The gobbler
gave the signal and off they started.
Whew! How fast they ran! Up hill and
down as fast as their legs would carry
them. They ran and they ran and they
ran. They ran all day and all night, and
all the next day. The Pony was ahead
by this time. Next came the Monkey,
and last of all the Bow-wow.
When th's night shadows fell the Pony,
looking back, saw that the others were far
behind bim, and, feeling quite tired, he
laid himself down to rest. "For," said he
to himself, "I cm jump up before they
reach me. and shall feel so much refreshed
after my little rest that I shall be able to
run all the faster. But the first thing he
did was to fall fast asleep.
Very soon up came the monkey, and
seeing the pony lying asleep, thought he,
too, would rest for a short time. ' "Bui I
shall not go to -deep like that foolish
Pony," he chattered to himself, â >nd by tne
time the Bow-wow reaches me I shall feel
better and can run with greater speed, so
he threw lrmself down, and was soon like
the pony, soundly sleeping.
By and by the Bow-wow arrived and
found the sleeping animals. "Well, I
think I'll run past them a ways and take
a bit of a rest myself," whined he, softly.
So be passed them quietly, ran on the way
lor quite a distance and then stretched
himself out on the ground to rest his weary
little legs.
"Even y I should drop off to sleep," ar
gued he with himself, when they awaken
the noise they make in running by me
will disturb my rest; then I'll jump up,
and being fresh may keep ahead of them
all the rest of the way." So very noon he
also was dreaming sweet dreams of suc
cess. : " 7 "
Now all three were asleep, and, being
very tired, they slept soundly all night
long and half of the next day. Perhaps
they might have been sleeping yet had
notalitle fly alighted on the Pony's ear
and tickled it so that the Pony opened
one of his great big eyes. He looked
around, . but saw nothing. Then be
opened the other great big eye and looked
around once more. This time be saw the
funny Monkey curled up by his side. He
arose and tried to find the Bow-wow, but
he was nowhere insight. "Ah! Mr. Bow
wow has stolen a march on me by run
ning on ahead!" whinnied he. '.'Well,
I'll soon find out .
Pretty soon he came to the doggie lying
j asleep in the middle of the road. Ho was
i so glad that he almost laughed right out
| loud. It seemed so very funny. He left
| the Bow-wow to enjoy his slumbers and
j ran on his way. On and on and on he
j trotted, galloped, loped! but he was still
I very sleepy, for you know the mischiev

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
ous fly had disturbed him before he had
finished his nap (a pretty long nap, I
think, don't you?).
"Oh, pshaw! I'm going to have some
more sleep," said he. "Even if the Mon
key and Bow-wow do pass me by, I can
run so much faster than they that I shall
easily overtake them end win the race at
last!"
Thereupon he threw himself down once
more and was soon again wrapped in
slumber.
Now all three were in "The Land of
Nod" and they slept -such a long, long
time that the little fly became impatient
for them to waken, so he flew down on
the Monkey's nose and tickled it. The
Monkey jumped up, and not seeing the
Pony he started oft to try to overtake him.
Pretty soon he reached the Bow-wow,
and being a good sort of a fellow he
aroused him and they set out side by side
running a-> fast as tbey could.
When they reached the Pony one ran to
the right and one to the left, so as not to
disturb his rest. When they bad left him
quite a distance behind they met and sat
down to rest.
Said the Monkey to the Bow-wow,
"Lets play a joKe on the Pony !" .
"All richt," answered the Bow-wow; so
back they went.
They tied the Pony's feet together and
hung him ud in a tree. They then ran
laughing away.
The Pony slept a long, long time, but
he little fly a. ter a while awakened him.
Poor fellow! How cross and angry he
was when he found himself in such a fix !
He kicked and he kicked and he kicked,
but could not kick himself loose.
By and by he saw some people pass and
he called to them. They looked to the
right, they looked to the left, they looked
before them and they looked behind them,
but they were too stupid to look up, and
as they saw nothing they became fright
i ened and ran away. The Pony called
alter them as loud as he could, but at this
they ran all the faster. - - '7:;7;
A great many other persons passed dur
ing the day and the poor Pony begged
I th m to take him down. They looked
; around at the sound of his voice, but
I being stupid folk*), too, never looked up,
I and becoming afraid ran away just as 'the
others bad done. -
I do not know whatever wo-ill have
I become of tne Pony if a little boy had not
i happened to come that way and heard
him crying to be taken down.
Now, this youni: lad had some sense-
He did not look around a bit, bat just
looked right up, saw the pony and had
him down in less time than it has taken
me to tell you. Mr. Pony thanked the
little man and then started off to catch
the Monkey and the Bow-wow.
My! how fast he did run! And the
i faster he ran the madder he grew. I. do
| not blame , him, do you? We would be
mad, too, if we bad been tied by our feet
I and hung in a tree, there to stay all
i day !-."': :'y
The next day he caught up with the
rascals. First, he kicked the Bow-wow,
and he kicked him so hard that he flew
i over a high mountain to the east. Then
| he kicked the Monkey, and he kicked him
so hard that he flew oyer two high moun
tains in the west, and for all I know they
are flying yet'
Then the Pony feeling much better ran
on and finished the race.
As he got in .first' he won the stick of
candy. As he got in last he was given
the tin whistle, and as he got in second he
also received the third prize which was
nothing at all. R. \v. Riggs.
An Unwelcome
Visitor.
One day papa told my sister Anna and
myself that a real tramp bad been seen
prowling abont the neighborhood. This
frightened us considerably, for we live on
an island where there are but few peonle.
My father keeps the general merchan
dise store. Some days passed and as we
saw nothing of the intruder, all thoughts
of him vanished from our minds.
One morning sister Anna felt quite ill
â nd as mamma's room is so pleasant she
was carried in there.
I took her breakfast to her, arid stood
beside her watching how much she en
joyed it. All at once I heard a slight
noise; raising my head quickly, to my
terror and surprise, 1 saw, peering in at
the window, tne tramp 1 Such a sight I
had never beheld. A professional tramp!
A Weary Willie! A bundle of rags! I
dropped the tray and ran screaming to
the dining-room. "The tramp, papa!
The tramp!" .7
Papa caught him and ordered him to
leave the premises' then, but to come to
the store at a certain time and he would
get him passage on the boat to the City.
The day passed and no more of Mr.
Tramp. In the evening mamma sent me
on an errand, and when I returned there
stood the fellow at our door.
I called. Papa came out and the men
shut him up in.the' barn, first. searching
him for weapons. They : found nothing
but dirty rags, so we sent him his supper
and then papa put him on the boat for
San Francisco. When he reached that
place I have no doubt but that he was es
corted to his headquarters (the County
Jail). I was very glad when I knew that
our unwelcome visitor had left our little
island once more in peace.

Bouldin, San Joaquin County.
The Carol Singer.
In the salon of a magnificent palace, on
the banks of a beautiful river, sat a lovely
Countess. *
It was Christmas ere and the yule log
burned in the open fireplace and the mis
tletoe hung irom the chandeliers, twined
with the holly branch.
The beautiful woman sat alone, waiting
the coming of her noble lord.
Suddenly she heard the patter of snow
flakes against the window-panes. She
started with a frightened look and placed
her hand over her heart, as if to quiet its
violent throbbing.
Why that,, longing look in the deep
violet eyes, and why that restless beating
of a sorrowing heart?
Ah, a bereaved mother is the answer.
The sound of carriage, wheels aroused
her, and soon the master of the palace
clasped his loving arms about his wife and
drew her gently toward him until they
stood under the mistletoe branch.
"Ah, dear Eleanor," he said, kissing
her fondly, "again those tears. Why
sorrow more for our precious one, who
must of a certainty now be with the holy
angels?"
Fifteen years before the beginning of
our story this noble lord and lady with
their baby girl were traveling through the
mountains of Spain. It happened that
one day they were overtaken by a dread
ful storm. Night came on and they lost

[Sketched from life near J.otta's Founta.n.]
j their way. While in the heart of a forest, |
' and while the storm was raging, they
I were attacked by Spanish brigands,, who,
â  besides robbing them of their purses and
jewelry, stole from their helpless arms
their baby girl.
-Ransom after ransom was offered for
her recovery, but she could not be found.
After spending large sums of money and
traveling from place to place in the hope
of finding her they at last, weary and dis
couraged, returned to their beautiful
home. But Lady Eleanor . possessed a
mother's heart, which is ever hopeful, and
no persuasion of her husband could make
her believe that she wonld never more
gaze with earthly eyes on her darling's
face.
'Peace on earth, good will to men.'
Hark! The little street arabs singing
Christmas carols," said Lady Eleanor.
Going to the window .they gaz>d out on
the snowy world. Everything everywhere
was clothed in a spotless garb.
The little carol-singers, on , seeing the
noble lady, cried out, "Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!"
As is the custom the children were
called within and given a merry Christ
mas. cheer. Among them was. a tall,
beautiful girl, one foreign to the rest ' She
was fair as an English maid, while they
were the dark-skinned daughters of a
warmer clime.
Lady Eleanor gazed on the fair, gentle
face and gently inquired her name.
"Carmelita, they p call me, but I have
another name; bet padre mis grows very,
angry when 1 say so."
"How long have you been singing
Christmas .carols on the street, CÂ»r
melita?" gently continued Lady Eleanor.
I ."Oh 'tis never before. till - to-night ; to
night for the first time." . :77 "77, 7
"Where were you born, my dear?"
"ln the mountains of CastUe." -
-Â "What is your father's name, my child?"
interrupted the lord.
. "Ramon Garcia, if you please, sir."
7 A. shriek from Lady Eleanor and the
astonished .iri was clasped in her arms.
' "My daughter! My daughter I At last I
At last leaven has granted my prayers!'
Rimon Garcia was the name of the leader
of the brigands, and he stole my baby
from me just fifteen years ago! Youi Oh,
how old are you, Carmelita^"
"I am ju-tt 15," answered the sweet,
trembling vcice.
Lady E.eanor's husband thought the
same as she .hat this must, indeed, bo
their daughter, but feared to arouse false
hopes until they could prove with a cer
tainty that it was, indeed, true.
Tbey sent the other children down to
the large dining-hall and bade the butler
serve them a bountiful supper and give
them beside food for the ones at home.
Then ; the carriage was ordered and the
three departed for "Ramon Garcia's"
lodgings.
It was a ? poor place indeed. Mounting
the stairs "Carmelita" ushered them into
a room where w.-'re sitting Ramon himself
and an old woman who had been the nurse
of the girl during all these years.
The old man made a full confession. He
told how be had stolen their childâ first
in orler to secure a royal ransom, and
then how he became so fond of the little
thing that he determined to Keep her for
his own.
"How did you happen to leave your own
country?" asked the gentleman.
7 "111 health and poverty," was the an
swer.
"And you sent this gentle girl out on
the street to sing in the bitter cold? A
fine way to show your lov â , I'm sure !"
"Oh, never before, â never before;
and she begged so hard to help poor old
Ramon. I thought so many years had
gone by no one would know her. And
now â and now â I've lost my Carmelita!
Yon will take her from me! I care not to
live without my Carmelita!"
But the girl would not leave him, and
so be was taken to the palace, where be
remaine I until his death. Carmelita
mourned for him bitterly, for he had al
ways been kind and gentle to her, and she
had Known no other father's care. But
she was young, and her bitter sorrow soon
passed away.- and she learned to love ber
handsome, refined father and her sweet,
gentle mother with a love much deeper
than had ever been awakened in her for
Ramon Garcia.
Carmelita was soon very, very happy in
her beautiful home/ and I'm sure neither
she nor her parents ever failed to bless the
only night upon which she was a little
"carol-singer." .

(alls, the deepest gorges, the big est
farms, the grandest orchards, the largest
fruit and biggest vegetables than any one
would be deemed unworthy of being
known as a Californian if he disputed any
of these assertions.
I remember some years ago hearing a
man with stentorian lungs shouting,
"Oranges â sweet oranges â every one as
big as a watermelon â everyone as sweet
ns sugar I" and we grew so accustomed : to
that cry that a man would have had a
quarrel upon his hands if he had at
tempted to deny that California oranges
were not as big as watermelons or as sweet
as sugar. ,
A lady of the Sacramento Valley some
years ago returned to visit relatives in
Indiana, and at first she often spoke of
this climate and productions, but she
observed look? ol incredulity pass over
the countenances of her friends when -<he
alluded to three crops of figs in one sea
son or lemons fresh on the trees at Christ
mas or oranges hanging on the trees dur
ing all the seasons. Finally she felt con
strained to cease praising the State lest
she should lose her reputation for truth
and veracity. .77*.. ; *'
That the Sacramento Valley is the most
wonderful valley in the world from an
agricultural and horticultural point of
view can be proved. This valley lies be
tween the Sierra Nevadas on the east and
the Coast Range on the west and is shel
tered from desert winds and ocean storms.
From its soil and climate it is able to
support a denser population to the square
mile than any other corresponding area of
the earth. It is 160 miles long and from
seven to fifty miles wide and contains, in
round numbers, 6000 -quare miles. If the
foothill- of the Sierras and Coast Range
were added the area would be increased
by 4000 square miles.
Compare this valley with the most
famous ones known! Compare its soil
and climate with that of the valley of the
Po in Italy, rich in olive plantations,
orange grovts and vineyards! Compare it
with the valley of the Hudson, so famous
for its thousands of orchards of plum,
par and apple trees! Compare it with
Hie valley of the Nile, renowned for its
prolific orchards of date trees! The Sac
ramento Valley in soil, in climate, in
number of clear days, in its abundance
and variety of productions will outrank
any of the others and support more
people to the square mile.
It is strictly within the bounds of truth
to say that the flowers of this valley bloom
every day in the year, and that fresh fruit
of some kind can be gathered from the
first to the last day of the twelve months.
Even in midwinter more than a dozen dif- i
ferent kinds of flowers can hi seen in
blossom in the different gardens of a val
ley town. The ripe orang â  hangs upon
the trees when the peach is in its perfec
tion. The black and oily olive is plucKed
beiore the lemon is ready for gathering,
and while the late apples and pears are
still upon the trees.
Almost every township in this valley
produces the orange, olive, fig, lemon,
peach, pear, apple, cherry, prune, apricot, !
nectarine, quince, pomegranate, Icquat,
walnut, shaddock, pomelo, grapefruit,
chestnut, and in the more sheltered spots
the guava and limes will thrive, and here
the date palm is grown and even the
banana ripens.
The planting of orchards and vineyards
has been rapidly earned on in this valley,
and when one takes into consideration the
ease with which money was made in grow
ing wheat and what immense tracts could
be easily bandied by . farmers it is a won
der that fruit-growing has made such
wonderful progress.
The State of Vermont is not as large as
this valley is, if the low ranges of foot
hills upon both sides are included, vet that
State supports a population of 332,000,
while this valley has but 157 000. That
State affords pasturage for 77,000 hogs,
362.C00 sheer, 84,000 horses, 169.000 head of
cattle and 234.000 cows, or almost as many
as the whole State of California.
Massachusetts has but a trifle over 8000
square miles, while this valley and low
foothills cover 10,000 miles, yet Ma-S-chn
setts has more horses, cows, sheep and
hogs than our broad and fertile valley.
Tbis valley is larger than New Jersey, yet
that State has 96,000 horses, 184.000 cows,
65,000 other cattle, 100,000 sheep and 200,-
OCO hogs.
Delaware is only a trifle larger than the
county of Butte, yet she has 25,000 horses.
30,000 cows, 28,000 other cattle, 22,000
sheep and 50.000 hogs.
The province of Lucca, in Italy, is no
larger than Yuba County In this valley,
yet its population is three limes greater
than the combined population of all the
counties in the Sacramento Valley.
Few habitable parts of the earth are
blessed with more clear sunny days than
the Sacramento Valley. It has more
clear days than either Los Angeles or San
Diego, although both are famous for their
climate. The average number of clear
days in the Sacramento Valley is 235,
while San Diego has 122 and Los Angeles
171.
The valley is far ahead of Florida in
climate, for the average in that State is
only 121 clear days in a yea- exc.pt at the
extreme southern point, where one of the
beys has 162 days. Italy * has long been
famed for her bright and genial climate,
yet the avera.e number of clear days in
Italy is only 196, or 41 less than this valley
has. It has more bright, clear days than
any part of France, Spain, Italy or Greece.
New York has 100. clear days in a year,
Philadelphia has 106, Baltimore 109, no
part of North Carolina more than 125, no
part of Georgia more than 126, and the
limit in South Carolina is 132, or but a
trifle more than half the clear days in
this valley.
In its "temperature the Sacramento
Valley ranks with the most favored parts
of the earth. Orovills is 6 degrees
warmer than Nice, 6}_ degrees warmer
than Florence, 4 degrees warmer than
Naples and degrees warmer than Rome.
Malta and ' Malaga have about the same
temperature as Oroville although they are
200 miles, further south, while Valencia,
in the same latitude, is only }_ degree
warmer. The annual temperature of
Cadiz, in Spain, is 62. degrees, while that
of Redding/ in the extreme northern end
of this valley, is 63 8 degrees. Palermo,
in Italy, averages 63.5, while Willows, in .
t' c center, of this great valley, averages
6* 4 degrees. Lisbon, in Portugal, aver
aces 61 degrees, while Woodland, in Yolo j
County, averages 62 8 degree?.
No part of the great valley averages less j
than 59 degrees, yet the average of Lon
don is only 50 degrees, Paris 51 and Mar
seilles 58.9. and all three are considered to !
have mild climates. The only places in j
this valley that go b.low 60 degrees for the j
annual temperature are Benic a and South
Vallejo, on the Straits of Carquinez. and I
they are . fully exposed to the continual j
' cold winds, and Auburn, which is situated j
j well back in the foothills and at a consid
erable elevation above the valley proper.
While the Sacramento Valley covers j
! but three-eighths of the State, it produces I
j two-fifths of the- wheat raised in Califor
| nia. The grain-growing portion of the
j valley covers only 6000 square mile?, white
I the area of Southern California embraces,
j in round numbers, 45,000 square miles, yet
this valley yields more wheat year after I
j year than all of Southern California. The
i average for the State is about 30,000,000
I bushels, and the yield for this valley is
J 12,000,000 bushels.
Portugal has an area oi 34,000 square
| miles; this valley and the adjacent foot
j hills in the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast
| Ranee covers 10,000 square miles, making
Portugal three and a half times as large
j as this region, yet her 5,000,000 people pro
| duce but 8.000.000 bushels of wheat, or
j only two-thirds the yield of this valley. 1
Greece has an area of 25,000 square miles
and a population of over 2,000,000, yet she
does not produce half the wheat this val
ley does.
The Sacramento Valley produces more
wheat than Holland and Denmark com
bined, yet their areas cover four times as
many square miles as this valley, and
their population is six and a half mil
lions, while that of the Sacramento Val
ley i 3 but a filth of one million.
The farmers of this section grow one
and a half times as much wheat as was
grown in the famous valley of the Nile
and more wheat than is raised- in the
countries of Switzerland, Servia, Norway
and Sweden combined.
While this valley contains but three
eiguiieths of the area of the State it pro
duces three-eighths of the hops raised In
California. The bop yield in Yuba, Yolo
and Sacramento counties leads all other
parts of the world. At Wheatland 307
bales of hops were taken from 371_ acres:
in another field of 47 acres 355 bales were
taken, and from a field of 125 acres 1586
bales were. taken. The net weight of
these 1586 bales was 298,000 pounds.
As the Pacific States raise nearly 50 per
cent of the hops of the United States the
industry here is an important one. When
New York and Wisconsin raised two
thirds of the whole crop of hops in this
country the average crop per acre was 650
pounds. In England the average crop is
750 pounds por acre. In Scatz, the , lead
ing hop dis. rict of Austria,' the yield is
from 350 to 400 pounds ; per acre. Wash- ,
ington is famous for its hop production
and its farmers raise enormous crops of it.
Kings County averages 2140 'pounds per
acre, while the average in Yuba County,
in this valley, is 2340 pounds per acre, that
being the highest average in the world.
In 1840 the United States grew 1,238 502
pounds of hops, while in 1891 r the Sacra
mento Valley produced 2,431.200 pounds
of the same product, or 1,000,000 more
pounds than the whole country produced
in lSmO^SsW^W^SkSmJ_ps%
The average yield in Wisconsin is 443
pounds per acre, in New York 547 pounds,
in Oregon 1125 pounds,' in Washington
1325 pounds and in California 1618 pounds.
Southern California is famed the world
over for the" variety and abundance of her
fruits. The area known as "Southern
California": covers 74s,ooo squar â¢ miles,
' while the area of the Sacramento Valley"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4; 1897.
including all the adjacent foe thills ot the
Sierras and the Coast Range, embraces but
10,000 square miles. When one compares
the figures in the production of fruit and
the acres of tearing trees, he will readily
see that thi? rich valley more than holds
its .own with the great fruit regions of
Southern California.
That region contained 9341 acres of apri
cot trees, while this valley has 7639
acres planted in this fruit. All Southern
California has 637 acres of bearing cherry
trees, while this valley has 1236 seres in
cherries. Southern California has 9534
acres of peach trees, while this valley has
21,637 acres in peach orchards. That re
gion has 4614 acres of pear?, while this
has 9968 acres planted in pear orchards.
Southern California has 13,467 acres of
table and raisin grapes, while this valley
lias ln round numbers 16,000 acres in the
same crop. The whole State contains but
10,000 acres of bearing almond trees, and
Butte County alone has twice as many as
all Southern California. Butte County
has. more orang â¢ trees than San Diego,
Santa Barbara and Ventura.
It will be seen from this that the Sacra
mento Valley' has more figs, almonds,
raisin, and table grapes, prunes, peaches,
pears and cherries than Southern Califor
nia.
While the orchardists of this valley
make no claims to be proficient in grow- I

' ing walnuts upon a large scale, yet there
it no county in .the valley that does not
contain some bearing trees, and in this
section there are 45,000 trees bringing
forth fruit each year. Tffihj-gfci
Olives are produced , in forty counties in
California, yet the eleven counties in the
Sacramento' Valley produce- more than
one-fifth of the olives raised in the State.
The acreage for this crop is rapidly being
extended, for it has been found that the
olive tree produces well without irrigation
and grows rapidly and luxuriantly in the
foothills up to an altitude of 2000 feet.
There 1b a vast territory which cannot be
brought under water, but which will grow
iho olive to perfection.
r It is but a few years since the orange
and the lemon began to attract attention
in the Sacramento Valley. It is true that
orange and lemon trees have been grown
here for.the past thirty. years, but no one
ever inane a business of : growing oranges
| for commercial purposes until 1886. Since
then a vast number of trees have been set.
out, and in a few years more the returns
will be large. Of the 60,000 acres in the
State planted in orange groves this valley
contains 8657, or more than one-seventh
of the total amount.
This valley is small in comparison with
the remainder of the State. It is less
than one-twentieth of all California, yet
it produces two-fifths of the wheat, a very
large percentage of the barley, one-fifth of
the olives, more than half of the almonds,
5 per cent of the app;es,_more than a
quarter ot the apricots, more than a fifth
of the cherries, more than a fifth of the
figs, one-sixth of the raisin and table
grapes, more than a third of the pears,
one-quarter of the prunes and one-third
of tho peaches.
The almond growth of the United
States is largely confined to California,
and the orchards of the State cover, in
round numbers, 10,000 acres. The Sacra
mento Valley contains more than half the
almonds grown in the State. Owing to
the great fluctuations in the returns from
the almond and from the prices realized, |
it is difficult to make an estimate of the
value oi this crop. The number of pear j
t're-s may be placed at 1,000,000, and if
the returns are estimated at $50 an acre
the gross yield would be $500,000 for the j
value of the pear crop.
Making the same estimate for the I
prunes, the number of trees being 1,100,- 1
000, the : returns would be $550,000. Thus
the value of the peach, prune and pear
crop of this valley would be somewhat
over $1,500,000 each year. >
California has 19,527 acres of apple trees,
and of this number he Sacramento Val
ley contains 1235 acres.
The fig of California rivals if it does not
surpass that of Asia Minor, and of the
5213 acres planted in the crop in the State
Sacramento Valley contains more than
one-fifth of the whole. ' :MfSSÃfSiÃ_m3SS^\
The apricot is one of the noted fruits of
the Golden State, and the orchards bear
ing this fruit cover more than 30,000 acres.
Of this acreage 7639 acres are found in the
Sacramento Valley, produce more
than a fourth of the total crop.
, The cherry.orchards of California cover
6728 acres,; and la 'this valley there are
1236 acres planted in cherries, more than
a fifth of the entire acreage of the State.
There are in the. Sacramento Valley in
round numbers 16,000 acres * of, raisin and
table grapes, and the crop _ is ; estimated if
at three tons to the acre, the yield would
be 96,000.000 pounds each year.
There is no better fruit region in the
world than the Sacramento Valley and all
varieties of fruit, except a few of the
purely tropical ones, are grown here. No
fruit produced in the valley does better
than the peach. The peach orchards of
this valley include fully 2,000,000 trees,
j yielding au annual product of 150,000,000
j pounds, and if the average value per acre
is $50â a low estimate the gross returns
from the peach orchards alone would be
$1,000,000 a year. The values of these or
chards cannot be less than six times tbis
amount.
The Sacramento Valley, has the largest
peach orchard in the Stateâ the Abbott
orchard in Sutter County â embracing 425
acres. The first fifty acres were planted
in the spring of 1883 and in the summer
of 1885 the trees yielded $6000 worth of
fruit, ln the summer of 1886 the yield
amounted to $12,000. V^Vri
The peach is extensively planted in both
Northern and Southern California, there
being no county that does not contain
this fruit in abundance. Of the 54,826
acres of trees now bearing peaches in the
State the Sacramento Valley contains
21,687 acres, or more than one-third of the
whole. . . 77: 7-7
â¢ It is but a few years since this valley be
gan to be known as a prune region, yet
now, of the 49.281 acres. in California, we
have in this valley 11.281 acres, or nearly
one-fourth of the total.
That 'it is a great pear region may be
seen from the immense shipments of pears
made from here every year, and from the
further fact that while the State has
23.742 acres of this fruit, the Sacramento
Valley contains 9968 acres, or considerably,
more than one-third of the whole. -

. Texas is greater in area than the whole
State of California, yet the Sacramento
Valley, which is less than a twentieth
part of the State, produces three times as
much wheat as all of Texas dees. This
valley yields six times as much wheat as
either Alabama or Arkansas grows; five
times as much as the four Middle States,
with an area of 94,000 square miles and a
population of 10,000,000, and twelve times
as much as the six New England States,
with an area of 65,000 square miles and
3,000.000 people.
There are in fact but thirteen States in
the Union that grow as much wheat as the
Sacramento Valley, and of the total quan
tity exported from this country the valley
grows nearly one-eighth of it. . â  7
While wheat is the most important
grain crop of the valley, its farmers grow
in addition immense quantities of barley,
corn, alfalfa and other products. The
single county of Butte has more acres of
barley than the whole of Arizona. The
county of Yolo has more acreage in barley
than the State of Washington, and Sacra
! mento County more than Oregon, so that
these three counties grow more barley
than these three States.
The county of Suiter has mors acres of
barley than the Blue Grass State, Kansas
has less acres than Tehama County, and
Pennsylvania less acres than Solano
County has. In the matter of exact
! figures, while Kansas has 24.000 acres
jof barley, Tehama County has 27,000
! acres; and while Pennsylvania has 23,000
acres, the county of Solano has 35,000
acres. Even such a great grain State
as Illinois" does not produce "as" much
barley as Butte, Glenn and Colusa coun
ties in this valley. The Sacramento Val
ley yields more bushels of barley than all
of the States south of Mason and Dixon's
line combiped. 7^7-

BERKELEY'S QUEER THEATER
playhouse Whose Business Manager Is
Only Ten years Old
i C|HLHE North Berkeley Theater is open.
Â«'l?v f a *' stations Â°* Berkeley the north
jlfjv end is the last to get a theater. The
one it has is a novelty, and destined to be
fully amusing. It has a boy who is only
10 years old for a manager. The actors
are all of like tender age. . The odd thing
about them is that they are all playwrights
in a way. They have already produced a
tragedy on Washington's birthday of
their own composition. Moreover, they
built their own stage, devised their own
system of footlights . and illumination,
and have a drop-curtain which rises and
falls at the instance of some invisible
agency, just like the drop-curtain of the
real big theaters in the city. They have
not yet progressed â these precocious and
imaginative youngsters â to the dignity
and glory of a set of sliding scenes; but,
tbey have an "orchestra," which plays
one tune, with variations â principally
variations of an involuntary sort i
. This temple of the Thespians, this
North Berkeley Theater, was opened on
Washington birthday. Patriotically em
blazoned with the American flag in various '
sizes was the auditorium and the row of
dazzling footlights was flanked at either
end of the banner of the brave and tbe
i free.
'â¢Tickets, please," demanded the youth
ful guardian of the door from a little miss.
"I haven't any ticket," said the incipient
new woman."
"Can't go in then," was the response.
, "Well," said the little miss, decidedly,
"I've been invited and I am going in and
that is all there is about it."
Past the astonished young doorkeeper
she grandly swept and took a seat
triumphantly in the front row. The door
keeper looked a little dazed, but paid his
attention for a minute to the other comers.
Then be looked at the little new woman
and said, "You* can't get out until you
buy a ticket." ..'
The show began sharp on time. The
doorkeeper was also one of the principal
comedians; also lent a band to raise and
lower the drop curtain ; did not forget to
carry his "cashbox," having a hole in its
lid to drop pins through, to a plr.ee of
cover; was ready at the proper time to
take part in a "shadow" boxing and wrest
ling bout, and later was a villain of the
.deeoest and darkest dye, with a fierce
mask enveloping his face and his humor
ous eyes glaring fiercely through two hori
zontal slits in -,: the maskâ home-made
affair of muslin the slits unfortunately
being out of line, so that it was difficult
to catch, the glare of both eyes simul
taneously. â  .
The tragedy was preceded .by.; an olio.
The orchestra, which consisted of one
small boy, played t a tune, which was, as
has previously been said, principally vari
ations, although once in a while the . tune
got a chance to be heard. Hardly had
the effect of this triumphant music died
away, when "Professor Carbon," ' with a
"decided and Frenchy accent on the last
syllable of his name, was announced. 777"
7 This professor does not belong to the
creased during a period when the grÂ«
ranches of Southern California were be
ing subdivided, for wheat-rowing was
very profitable, and this led to the accu
mulation of land by the largest owners.
Taking Butte County as an illustration,
there were eight owners in 1875 who
owned 5000 acres or upward, the aggre
gate holdings embracing 109,000 acres. In
1880 nine men owned 126,123 acres. Five
years later the number of men who owned
5000 or more acres each was twelve, and
their holdings numbered 195,235 acres.
The average of the largest holders in 1875
was 10.100 acres. In 1890 fifteen men
held an average of 13,000 acres each.
In 1875 the largest individual hold
ing-was 25,062 *, acres; while in
1890 the largest was 29,860 acres. In 1875
the fifty largest holders in Butte owned
184,-86 acres, while fifteen years later the
fifty largest owners held 287,686 acres, they
baying increased their possessions be
tween these dates by 83,000 acres.
What is true of one valley county is true
of all. Tehama, Colusa,- Yolo and Solano
show the same enormous increase, in land
holdings during those years that Butto
did. Colusa, for instance, had in 1880
336,581 acres owned by her fifty largest
owners. 7ln 1885 the possessions of these
men had Increased to 450,709 acres, while
in 1890 they had increased to 523,743 acres.
The lessening in the price of wheat dur
ing the past few years has had a tendency
to break up the big land holdings and turn
the attention of farmers to other crops
besides grain.
Flax and hemp are being tested in many
localities and the farmers are meeting
with gratifying success. The culture of
sugar beets shows that tbe soil and climate
of this valley are well adapted to beets.
Creameries are being organized in many
localities, and they have been very suc
cessful wherever established.
It has been demonstrated beyond ones*
| tion that just as good butter can be made
in the Sacramento Valley as on the coast
'< or in the mountains. The immense crops
of alfalfa grown here show that feed in
enormous quantities can be produced, so
that butter-making is certain to become a
very important industry in the near
future. Coal has been found in a num
ber of localities in the valley or in the
adjacent foothills, while it is known that
natural gas exists in many places.
Orchard planting is now exceedingly
active and thousands of acres will be
planted this year. The olive is destined
to become of vast importance in this part
oi the State and tens of thousands of treas
will be planted along the low foothills and
up to the limit of culture on account of
snow on the Sierra Nevadas and in the
Coast Hangs.
The Sacramento Valley has as yet shown
nothing lite its full capacity, nor will it

Professor Carbon is a little more than
4 feet tall. His face had been blacked
until it was shiny. He had a fierce mus
tache, and in his eyes was a dreamy and
faraway but nevertheless mischievous
look. How he charmed the babies and
amused the "grown-up children" who
have beards and wrinkles or babies of
their own, as he made coins mysteriously
disappear and poured liquors of half a
dozen colors out of the same glass, one
after another! Little girls tittered and
giggled and babies looked on with solemn
and wide-eyed astonishment, tint this
came to an end. Then there were magic
lantern views which explained themselves
I the best that they were able, and which
was not very well, and then finally the
course of events led up to the tragedy,
which was very real and amusing.
While the "orchestra" is playing and
the white drop-curtain is down the foot
lights come in for their full share of in
spection. They are on a string. .7 At ;
either end of the string is a pot-bellied
Japanese lantern of a half candle power.
Between these two are a "score of tiny
lanterns such as ate used in the decora
tion of Christmas trees, of the power of
one Christmas tree taper each. These are
crowded close together on the string,
cozied up like coy birds with luminous
intervals on' a branch.
The seating accommodations are some
what interesting. The seats are graded
down like tha chairs in the bear's house
in the woods which was discovered by
Goldilocks chair for the' big bear,
middling-sized chair for' the middling
sized bear and tiny little chair for the little
bit of a bear. Half the seats are chairs
from _ nurseries little red-painted affairs,
tome not too big for a "Brownie" ; others
large enough for. the phenomenally fat
infant with the phenomenal bass voice
when it cries. The general illumination is
by candles. :
; Of course, the theater is small. Every
word of a discussion concerning the hand
made programme which the chief
tragedian and the manager carry on is
audible. The chief tragedian expresses
the unqualified opinion that the pro
gramme was no goodâ albeit it was a work
of patient industry, and really was vastly
entertaining. r JJ\ David f H. Walker.
Size irv Hats.
A size in hats is one-eighth of an inch. ,
According p, to the English method the
smaller diameter of tho head is taken as
the starting point. One-eighth of an inch
increase in the shorter diameter makes a
little more' than three-eighths in the cir
cumference. The French and German,
hat makers have a rule slightly different
from this."

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
BONNY GOWN FOR SPRING.
T-yy^P-TO-DATE women combine this
J hjffijj* season charity with most of their
%___*/) simple little afternoon affairs and
one of the most popular is the tea-tasting j
party, as it is extremely amusing.
The invitation is expressed in odd and J
pretty, but very formal sentences, pre
sumably a la Japanese, and it is written !
or engraved on a largo sheet of Japanese I
rice paper, over which are scattered indis- >
tinct cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums, j
tea horses and rickshaws. It is delicately J
scented, and folded narrow and long, a j
thread of scarlet silk holding it together. I
On one's arrival at the home of her
hostess her eyes will be delighted with
great beds of gorgeous tulips In tiled
boxes, arranged iv every nvailable nook,
and where they cannot be placed to ad- j
vantage will be pots of white and purple
flowering lilacs. Half a dozen or more I
tables will be arranged around the room,
on which will be placed truly oriental tea
equipages, but more gorgeous than all
the flowers and more lovely to gaze upon
will be the hostess and the pretty maidens
who will assist her, all being arrayed in
the richest and most beautiful of bro- j
caded costumes, such as Japanese ladies I
of noble birth don on great occasions in j
the Flowery Kingdom.
The girls preside over the tables and
each is provided with a tiny pad, pencil
and purse, and after you have had a cup
of tea you pay 10 cents for it and on the
pad you register your guess as to what tea
you have been drinking, and to the guest
who guesses most correctly is given some
charming prize â queer bit of embroid
ery, an exquisite piece of china or a rare
specimen of ivory richly carved. Of
course, a tour of all the tables must be
made, but I almost forgot to tell you that
before even entering the tearoom, or !
rooms, you must drop at least $1 into the
almsbox at the door, for all the money
collected goes to aid some worthy charity.
Of course, the hostess and ber assistants
have their hair and eyebrows made as
Oriental in appearance as possible, and
many an English butler has been seen re
cently in the lull regalia of a Japanese
head servant, and the orchestra must be j
from Japan. These functions are in great
vogue In New York, as are also perfume
parties.
These, however, are given in the even
ing and fancy dress is de rigueur. The
idea of the perfume party is to . burn or
otherwise liberate various .fragrant ex
tracts, toe prize being awarded to the
fortunate possessor of the most delicate
sense of smell.
This idea is of Eastern origin", as in that
part of the world the test ot a refined nose
is the ability with which it can distinguish
between dozens of different spices, pas
. tiles, syrups and delicate powders slowly
burned in a copper brazier or swung aloft
in a jeweled and .fretted . temple censer.
Out in Japan, , China and India only the
strictly native perfumes are used, but the
clever American hostess goes a step; fur
ther. She first sends out her invitations
on delicately scented, paper land when a
perfume party is given all other odorous
substances save that to be exposed in the
brazier are expelled from her drawing
room. This means no flowers. are used,
and everyone is expected to come without
so much as a drop, of cologne on the
handkerchief. In the center of the draw
ing-room's parquette floor a luxurious
divan is placed or a number of silk pil
lows ; heaped. Before the pillows sits a
Benares brass perfume-burner, and every
guest,' when ready to try their luck at
identifying sweet odors, first propitiates
a tall ivory goddess on a lovely, teakwood
shrine in one corner of the room , by drop-,
ping a piece of silver into a platter at her
feet. '
In reality the goddess is only, a quaint
sham, for her devotees' offerings go to
swell the funds of a babies' .hospital.
But no matter, that is part of the fun,
so after piously offering to tho ivory
lady on the lotus, flower, the guest has
a square of soft red Oriental silk tied
about his or her eyes,' and is then/ led to
the cushions." Here it ' ia the proper
thing to sit - Turk fashion, while from
mysterious little boxes onto live coals
in tbe brazier a few pellets are dropped.*
As wreath of" delicate blue smoke arises
a great sniffing ensues, and the blind
folded person suggests a name for the
rich aromatic or evanescent aroma that
fills the air. Besides the Eastern essences
spices are subjected to the heat, a bit of
cambric moistened in a cologne or purely j
occidental extract from flowers, and every
decision given by the blindfolded person
carefully registered. At the end of the
evening the tally is made up, and to the
man or woman whose nose was most faith-
ill to the trust confided in it falls a prize
of a gor.eou* sachet, silver cologne jug or
some other equally appropriate trophy.
The fancy dresses worn on such occa
sions are varied, but most of the women
appear as Eastern dancing girls, musmes,
or Rajpoot ladies, and the men are pic
turesque in turbans, Oriental scarfs,
slipper-*, a few daggers and the rest of tog
gery requisite.
Some New Fashions in Vests and Jewelry for Men.
As for styles in men's clothing in the
matter of vests, preference for something
"fancy" is more marked than it has b en
for.years. For .dress purposes the latest
innovations are figured -ilk vests in black
or white. They are marked and brocaded
in elaborately handsome patterns, and
the finest are of heavy band-made mate
rial whose texture is very difficult to imi
tate in any sort of cheap goods. Spitals
fields silk is a specially choice goods for
this purpose.
"Some of San Francisco's fashionable
tailors have an array of fancy vestings
that in richness would rival anything the
ladies wear. Some patterns are of white
and gold, with the gold appearing faintly,
and they are masterpieces of the textile
art. Others in black are so rich in design
as to fairly fascinate the eye. A few pat
terns in drab and lavender are also very
handsome, and a design which is a favor
ite is white with a blue silk figure woven
through it. The large patterns are rec
ommended as showing to the best advan
tage when worn, as they do not show
nearly so conspicuously then as when
seen in the goods in the bolt.
, Demi-dress vests show either a single
breasted effect with a notched collar or
are double-breasted, with lapels cut off.
The edges are finished to correspond with
those of the coat. For evening dress the
U-shaped cut is the standard for this sea
son, but the fashionable tailors say the
majority of the best-dressed men here
prefer to adhere to the V shape, which
has an incomparably better set and pre
vents an awkward bulging of the stiff shirt
bosom.
In business suits the single-breasted,
no-collar vest ls much liked, although it
is not the prime favorite. It has six or

For Everyday Wear.
Tailor-made suits are to be universally
worn by smart women as stieet costumes
and when traveling. The skirt and jacket
combination will be most popular. It is
certainly surprising how, many changes
are made in so simple a model.' The Eton
jacket will also be much worn, but the
bolero models are more fashionable.
The strictly plain tailor gown is worn
principally by business and professional
women. Tbe leading tailor- will reap a
harvest, as the braiding and ornamenta
tion of some of the handsomest costumes
make them exceedingly costly, and, with
out exception, all must be made over silks
of a very superior quality. Many of the
models recently shown, although desti
tute of trimming or braid, are of such
beautiful cloth that the effect is most ex
cellent. So all may be well gowned by
their tailors provided they avoid exagger
ations.
The braided Eton jacket is the naturar
sequence of the bolero, from wbich it
differs mainly In possessing sleeves,
whereby it may rank as a species of coat.
The decoration ln braid frequently im
parts to it tbe character of the military
mess jacket.
Tailor skirts continue to grow smaller by
degrees and must fit smoothly around the
hips. ' Only around the hem is any stiffen
ing allowed, and then only three or four
inches, so as to induce the braiding or the
machine stitching to set symmetrically.
The tiniest of bustles are being worn,
placed in the back, just where so many
women are concave, for when a skirt is ab
solutely ti ht just below the waist it some
times reveals ugly lines. But there is no
i reason to fear the return of the large
! bustle for many seasons yet to come.
The latest cloths are extremely light, but
thicker than usual on account of the very
elaborate patterns braided on them, and
plain skirts are not much in evidence.
A noted tailor has, within the past
few weeks, completed several attractive
gray cloth dresses. One of these is orna
mented from th- hem to the knees with
rows of braid and another shows a fanci
ful design also extended to the knees.
A very artistic gown displays a beauti
! ful vine pattern carried around the bot
j torn. Almost equally chic is another cos
' tume elaborately ornamented with an
! Egyptian design in black on a gray back
i ground. The same artist in cloth is
stocking jackets, which range from the
bolero to tue reefer. The former is made
tight-fitting to the waist, and in most
cases covered with a beautiful pattern in
braid, which extends to the Medici collar,
which completes it at the neck. The
reefer is usually left plain and fastens at
one side with large buttons.
The sleeves most generally seen are
seven buttons and the edges are double
stitched. The opening for ordinary sizes
is fourteen inches. In a single- br
shawl, or rolling-collar vest, intended for
general purposes, the opening is some
what lower. It closes with five buttons
and the edges are single-stitched.
The .-ingle-breasted notch-collar vest is
perhaps the most popular style for demi
dress. It is made of a variety of materials.
There are some new and very neat designs
in worsted. They generally close with five
buttons, but this is usually subject to the
tallness and taste of the' wearer. . The
single-breasted dress vest is more com
monly worn tnan the double-breasted, but
fashion leaves the preference entirely to
the wearer, and whether they are black or
white is also left to the discretion and
fancy of the individual. But it is de
cidedly the growing fashion that vestings
should be ornately fancy, and authorities
predict that fancy colors will soon be worn
for dress purposes, ln fact they are
already being worn by a limited number.
The openings in dress vests of this pattern
should be 20 inches, and the buttons
should not be crowded. It has but two
pockets. The .double-breasted dress vest
closes witb hut three buttons unless the
wearer is unusually long in tbe body.
A double-breasted vest made of wash
able fabrics will be much worn this sum
mer, either with a double-breasted frock
coat or a single-breasted walking coat.
These have . four pockets, are closed with
three buttons and may be well- nigh as
fancy as you please, White, with a figure
woven in of colored silk, gives a very
striking effect. 7
A style now much in vogue for walking
is in very fancy vestings, with double
breast and the lapels cut off, closed with
SOME THINGS THAT STYLISH MEN W-LL WEAR.
moderate in size and set in small pleats at
the top, but the regular coat sleeves are
certainly, to my mind, by far the "most
stylish, and will shortly enjoy the great
est vogue. Indeed, I strongly advise you
in ordering a handsome suit or jacket to
have this variety of sleeve. Some plump
women consider that the basque bodice
cut into tabs is more becoming to them
than any other style in cloth, and as a re
sult a lew orders are being given for them.
Harper's Bazaar states that short jackets
are again in style this season, and both
black and light colored cloths will be worn.
The covert coats are as jaunty and smart
as ever, with little or no chango in cut. j
single-breasted, with very narrow revers j
open just a little way at the throat, one j
bias dart to give the desired curve at the i
side, and tight-fitting in the back, with no
flare nor ripple. The covert cloths are
never braided and even the black cheviots
and camels-hair are now often made
plain; if braided, the hand braiding is re
quired, not machine work. In all the
jackets the cut and fit are more considered
than anything else; the sleeves are very
much smaller, merely wide enough at the
top to allow for the 'fullness of the dress
sleeve, and are gathered into the armhole,
so tbat they stand out from the shoulders,
giving the desired width.
Another popular style of jacket it* made
witb a straight, flat front, which opens on !
the left side and is fastened by four nar
row, leaf-shaped tabs, cut out of the cloth
front and bound and stitched with the
same braid with which the jacket is
trimmed, and buttoning to four pearl but
tons. Near the buttons, on the left, there
is a small flap-pocket. The cloth collar is
nothing more than a high flat band suit
able for a ruff, or the new little circular
linen cellar flaring out like a rim.
"Thousands of women are now planning
ordering their tailor gowns, and I there- |
fore wish to present as concisely as possi
ble descriptions of the latest and hand
â  somest seen thus far this season in New
York, London, Paris and Vienna.
At the Auleuil steeplechases the Prin-
I cess de Polignac had on a blue serge cos-
I tume, with a wide trimming at the foot of
I the skirt of white and ecru cloth, cut out
j and interlaced; bolero bodice, with white*
I revers embroidered with steel, the lower
part of the bodice striped with white and
I ecru cloth; white waistcoat, covered with
j chiffon, and lace cravat; black straw
loquet, with black feathers. A Rouma
| nian lady wore a soft black cloth dress,
j made with plain skirt, bolero bodice, em
broidered with steel, mixed with a little
I gold and jet, opening over a small waist
! coat of cerise velvet, over which was a
j plastron and revers of ecru lace; waist
nnd neck band of black satin, with a bow
j at the back of the neck; toque of black
taffetas plisse, with an enormous black
four buttons and with an opening of about
fourteen inches.
In evening dress the peaked lapel is said
to have the call to a slight extent over tbe
shawl collar.
The reports from England say that the
fancy Spitalsfield silk vestings have, after
many predictions that they would fail of
wide acceptance, forced- their way into
prominence and are now very freely, made.
They are being made even by leading
West End houses, who at fiist ridiculed
the idea because it did not emanate from
themselves. San Francisco tailors agree
that the time la ripe for something fetch
ing in waistcoats generally, and the pub
lic is taking very kindly to the fashion.
Those who object to gorgeousness on gen
eral-principles must hasten to put away
prejudice snd get their mind into a con
dition to take delight in the rich beauty
of the fashion while it lasts. . -
-Soma -of the : fashionable tailors have
a washable goods for waistcoats in linen
of drill and duck texture. They are beau
tifully woven and have -a very rich-look,
without being in. the least gaudy. They
are in shades of tan and. -White
summer vests will not be worn on the
street. â ..".;,
At the fashionable haberdashers there
are some very handsome styles of fancy
vests in washable goods. Some of the
tastiest of these are of heavy linen crash,
woven in basket-work patterns. There is
a wide variety, and it- would be hard to
choose from among so many neat designs
that which excels in beauty. > In these
vests the prevailing style provides lor
large patch pockets. --
-In. the matter of jewelry preferred by
tasty men tbero has been little ; or no
poppy," and white suede gloves. Quite a
number of women wore red cloth dresses,
on the skirts and bodices of which were
black mohair braid. Indeed the fancy for
red _ promises "to continue for the - next
three months.
Very effective is a creation made, with
the loose style of coat of a drab broad
cloth. On the skirt, above the knees, is
carried out a fanciful design in braid. Tne
coat hangs straight from the neck almost
to the waist and is trimmed! with the
braid and buttoned with unique enamel
buttons. A deep collar turns up round
the neck and is notched in tabs around
the top. The sleeve are cut in the same
form at the wrist and are outlined with
braid. .
Very simple but stylish is the tailor suit
owned by a New York girl, of blue covert
coating, with lapped seams, velvet collar
and cuff â¢ and a lining of shot _reen and
blue silk. The coat is very long, has a
deep turned down collar and large sharply
pointed re vers.
The coat is cut as to show to advantage
a smart waistcoat, with six large buttons
and a large turned-down collar. The
shirt has one stud and a tremendously
high collar, with wbich is worn a spright
ly cravat. Of course this Eastern girl is
unusually tall and very slender, other
wise she could not stand such a revers or
sucn a collar. Completing this toilette is
a blue straw walking hat, trimmed with
a large bow of some soft white stuff, from
the center of which arises a large black
aigrette, held in place by a buckle.
A London belle wears a conception
built of box cloth, with a coat of Chester
field cut The cloth is putty color and all
the seams and edges are piped with helio
trope velvet. The revers are of the cloth
applique, outlined by, putty-colored braid
over heliotrope velvet. , 7.-7 ,_ 7
, Humor declares that amethyst purple
is to be in great demand, and a great
English tailor has sent home a dress of
satin cloth in this shade. Its coat is a
regular . Chesterfield, and the . entire cos
tume is beautified by the. use of black
velvet, outlined by black and gold braid.
From these descriptions it is easy to see
that styles to suit every shade and form
and all occasions are to be had. Hence
the great popularity of the tailor gown.
Coat for a Child.
I have no intention of slighting the
young people, so will tell you about a
little coat, made of drab box cloth, with a
pointed yoke and pointed pieces over the
tops of the sleeves, outlined with stitched
strappings. It hangs at the back in two
box pleats, and is quite straight in front.
Any. child -from seven to twelve might
wear such a coat. The box-pleated back
may be replaced by an ordinary sacback
of moderate fullness. The sleeves are
medium, the collar high and notched.
Six large buttons adorn the front and
two pocKets. The entire garment Is
double stitched with silk. Mabcella.

Wearing of the Green.
It is the wearing of the green in earn
est. Jackets, capes, dresses, hats â all
things that women count among their ex
terior clothin- are akin to the Emerald
Isle, at least in color. It is the gray green
of the sheathed bud that contains the
flower ready to bloom, the delicate tint of
the bud itself, and the brighter coloring of
the expanded leaf. Violet shades, particu
layly Parma violet, rank second only to
I preen in point of popularity. Very light
change for this season. Link cuff-buttons
are still worn and the oval shape is most
used. A very tasty article in this line,
which combines beauty with simplicity,
is a plain oval of Horn an gold, ln this
the richness of the metal's color is brought
out in a very pleasing way. Other favor
ite designs are ovals of gold setting, con
taining some of the semi- precious stones,
such as topaz, amethyst and garnet The
dumbbell pattern of cuff-button is consid
erably worn. Some of these, made of car
buncle amethysts, are very pretty. For
mourning these dumbbells of jet are
simple and tasty.
Some of the watch fobs now worn
with evening dress are of very handsome
design. The contrast of the gold bands
across the black silk make both gold and
silk more beautiful. A. very tasty one
here shown starts with a tiny swivel and
a few very slender links, while below, to a
cleverly designed buckle, is suspended the
gold enclosure of an onyx charm. Other
designs in vogue are fac-simiies of old
fashioned 'seals. For other than evening
dress watch chains of either, the single or
double style are equally fashionable.
Some of the handsomest are of gold in
single links, and get their beauty more
from daintiness of workmanship than any
broad display of the precious metal.
There will probably always be a few men
who will continue to like to wear finger
r.ngs. For those the newest and hand
somest are either diamonds or combina
tions of precious stones sunk deep into a
heavy protuberaiion of gold in the style
called gypsy setting. Magnificent things
in coiled . serpents with eyes of diamonds,
suggestive of the wicked power of fascina
tion, are out in new designs and are much
liked.

tones of stone color are often v.orn, as are
chestnut, russet and cinnamon brown.
One of the popular costumes In grey
green cloth is trimmed with emeralds, or
imitations thereof, and steel gaion. The
bolero-shaped short bodice is fastened with
cne large alleged emerald and steel but
ton, over a full vest of pale Parma violet
silk. The reversare edged with gaion and
the sleeves finished off with the same at
the wrists, and frills of lace, the high
tabbed collar being treated in a similar
manner. A hat of coarse gray-green straw,
which completes the costume, has a twist
of violet silk around the crown and a j
bunch of shaded ostrich feathers starting
from an emerald and steel square buckle.
Really, however, the topic of the hour
is the coat and jkiit. Are they to be
dark, light, plain or braided? Must the
jacket be long or short? The genui" who
answers these questions must consider
herself a mainstay of fashion. The diplo
matic one says, bave a coat and skirt of
both kinds. If you cannot have but one,
however, take a gray or drab cloth. This
is positively fashionable, no matter who
says it is not. The people who rule fash
ion* and frame the dictates of the fickle
dame say It is so. Then a dark cloth
dress is very excellent. ' There is no use
trying to deny the fact that the skirts of
the hour are trimmed. Plain rows of
braiding will meet the demand of fashion
for decoration, and an excellent way of
treating these is to permit them to extend j
their influence around the back and ter
minate in a small curl design on either
side of the front seams.
A model costume is evolved from the
decoration of a plain skirt of dark blue
with rows of machine stitching up to the
knees, the coat of this being cut into
square tabs reaching to the waist, not
tight fitting, yet scarcely deserving the
title of sack. This coat fastens over at
one side with pointed revers faced with
guipure and is worn over a bodice of blue
and green plaid glace, showing a waistcoat
of guipure mounted on lisae. The hat to
this is made of blue and green shot straw,
trimmed with large rosettes of glace rib
bon and a bunch of blue poppies with
green centers.
This is to be a year of brilliant millin
ery. The combination of color is some
thing to be remembered, and not always
because it is pretty. For instance, one
model is of bright blue â¢ and green straw,
with large mauve iris arranged in aigrette
form and twists of all the colors in silk,
fastened with large paste ornaments. The
crown is high and the brim broad. And
tbe 'mil liner says that hats will be larger
yet. Verily, if we are ultra-fashionable
this season we will have to suffer for it.
Straw hats are decorated with bands
of folded ribbon set on the top of the
crown, with huge bunches of violets or
primulas oh each side. The coloring of
the new straws is vivid in the extreme,
including the brightest of blues, greens
and pinks.

Afnss__lJv the steep and narrow pavements of
Chinatown under the escort of their proud'
fathers, their plump and smiling mothers,
anxious-eyed slave girls or their older
brothers or sisters.
They are always arrayed in colors
brighter and more varied even than those
which dye the plumage of tne most bril
liant of the parrot family. Their tiny,
white-stockinged feet shuffle unsteadily
along in the while, wooden-soled shoes
peculiar to their race, and then- night
black locks are crowned with curiously
fashioned embroidered cans, irom which
depend as many festoons of rib Dons, beads
and silken braids as the family purse can
supply or the family taste demands.
Taken altogether the Chinese child out
for a holiday is a sight that, although fa
miliar to San Franciscan eyes, never
ceases to be interesting. - The eyes of the
"Fon-* Wai" gaze nt the small specimen of
Orientalism with curiosity alone, but the
Chinese, one and all, from the high-rank
' mandarin to the poorest coolie, look upon i
the baby Mongolian with an affectionate
kindliness which is as genuine as it is
universal.
The Chinese manied woman who has
no children considers herself if not ac
tually disgraced at least a most unfor
tunate and unhappy person, and she un
ceasingly spends both time and money in
various rites, the object or which is to
propitiate the stern deities whose disfavor
she thinks she has innocently and un
wittingly incurred. V
The Chinese wife to whom the fates are
kind, unless she is a "mission girl," passes

monies the sexâ boys being always

Myths Scientifically Viewed
'WSJiIV. latest sta-i-e in that branch of
"t'Jifr* the science of mythology which
<*ks*y concerns itself with the scientific
origin of myths is due to Professor B. K.
Emerson, who, in a recent address before
the American association, traced som- of
the best known and most beautiful myths
of antiquity to scientific phenomena.
The identity of tne story Of Tantalus
with solar phenomena was long ago
pointed out by Rev. George Cox. Tanta
lus was Â«i Phrygian myth. When he as
cended the heaven-, it was to consult with
the King of Gods. When a drought came,
and burned no the fruits which the Ml*.
heat had brought to light, the Phrygian
Raid that Tantalus was slaying and wash
ing his child Pelops. His subsequent pun
ishment â hi? stooping to drink the water
which shuns his approach, and to eat the
fruits which elude his grasp points to
the drying up of the stream* and the
withering of herbage by the fierce heat of
the sun. Hercules is another impersona
tion of the sun ; his labors are poetic ver
sions of the sun's contests with the clouds
and the rain. As he sinks on the funeral ,
pile, fiery mists embrace him. and purple
vapors rush across the sky like streams of
blood rushing from the hero's body, while
violet-colored evening clouds cheer him
in his dying a*;ony. Many incidents in
the most beautiful: of all the Greek
v ; legends those of Theseus and Perseusâ j
\ may also be traced to a meteorological
origin. To the poetic mind of the Greek,
there was a hero and, a drama in every
cloud and sunburst' -V
A myth whose, origin may be easily
traced to a scientific source is that of the
chimera. According to Homer the chi
mera was a monster,- witU the tail of a
dragon, the body of a. goat, the headâ
solne said she had two or three head? â of
a Hon. She breathed fire and destroyed
, vast numbers of people till she herself
was killed by Belierophon. She ravaged
the mountains of Lysia and ate the hock-..
Her favorite home was a mountain now
known as the Yanar Dagh. ..Recent trav
elers In that region report thai under the
mountain there is a reservoir of natural gas,'
from which streams have been flowing
and burning from time immemoiial; they
also mention that a species. of mountain
lion is also abundant in that v.cinity.
Here we have the .genesis of the. mon
ster, the lion, which was familiar to the in
habitants, and to which it was only neces
sary in fancy to append the body/ of a
goat and the tall of a dragon to call the
chimera into existence; and the fire, which
really bubbled- out of the cracks in the
earth, and which a heated Imagination
could readily have placed in the jaw of the
same beast. Petroleum and natural gas'
abound in the region between the Mediter- 'â 
ranean, the Black and Caspian seas;, they
will account for the fire-breathing bulls
which Jason bad to overcome before he
could possess bin>*-it of the golden fleece i
at Colchis. If the early Britons bad been
gifted with as . rich a fancy as the Greeks
they would have filled the plains of York- |
I* 1 re with fire-breathing creatures to ex- j
plain the inextinguishable jets of coal j
gas which the traveler observes -from the
railroad train as he passes. .
Some of the ancient myths still await j
explanation. One of these is the oracle of
Delphi. Throughout antiquity the priest- !
ess of Delphi was supposed to possess the j
gifts of divination and prophecy;, she
quisite embroideries and rich laces, are
fashioned by loving fingers for Chinese
babies. Their attire while they are very
young is simplicity itself, since it consists
only of being wrapped loosely but com
fortably In "baby blankets" of .warm
flannel and silk. This style of costume,
though not particularly pretty, has its
compensations, for there are no wearying
seasons of dressing and undressing to be
gone through. There are no tight bands
to compress the delicate little bodies, no
cruel pins to jab them, and no heavy
skirts to fetter their legs and drag upon
their small spines. . ;
A c;*adii-p finds no place in a true Chinese
household, but the loving mother fashions
a kind of hammock in which she carries
her little one on her back nearly all her
waking hours. Should the child be fret
ful, as even imperturbable Chinese babies
occasionally are, she twists one of her
arms backward and upwarJ, and, gently
patting the small .bundle of discontent,'
sings to it some of the many ,4 baby
jingles" which have hushed their an-

cestors to sleep for centuries past, but she
never rocks and rarely "cuddies" it.
When the baby grows too strong and
active to be kept within the bounds of
blankets it is promoted to the dignity of
under-garments and a slip or sack of some |
warm materia!.
At tbe age of 1 year the national cos
tume of blouse and trousers is assumed.
Generally three or four blouses of vivid
colors and different lengths are worn, the
shortest on the outside, and the trousers
are always left to flap loosely about the
; feet of the girls, while those of the boys'
! are tied closely about their ankles.
For the first six years of its existence a
Chinese child of any station is as thor
; oughly happy as mortal can be, for it is
petted and indulged iri all possible ways
by every one with whom it comes in con
tact. ,-.'77'
"Baby is king" all over the civilized {
world, but nowhere is his sway more ab
solute than it is among the Chinese. The i
was said to obtain these mystical power,
by seating herself on a tripod over a deep
chasm in the earth whence proceeded an
intoxicating vapor. Modern exploration
has demonstrated . that no vapor now
issues from any part of the D-dphian
rocks, and there has been no convulsion
of nature in that part of the world, at
least since the time of Strabo, nor is -any
gas known to chemists which, if inhaled
or absorbed, could sharpen the faculties.
/i side episode complicates the . story.
When Europa was carried away by Jupi
ter ncr family wa3 plunged into grief, and
her brother Cadmus wis charged with the
duty of finding her and bringing her
home. He found her at Delphi, to which
place she had voyaged from Crete, and
there she was keeping company with a .
cow.' No scientific explanation of this j
myth has been proposed; it seems to rest
on pure fancy. and the oracle appears to |
be simply a bald iraud.
Crete, the present battlefield between
Greek and Moslem, is fall of myths which
have defied investigation. Some of them j
are supposed to b3 anterior to the Greek j
civilization and to have been imported
from Asia Minor or the Phenician
colonies. The Minotaur, who lived in a
labyrinth and every year consumed seven
Athenian maidens and seven beautiful
youths, may rerhap3 have been a proto-. i
type of the robber barons of the middle \
age., who built castle 3on inaccessible
crags and sallied forth to make captives
of the daughters of the peasantry in the !
valleys; but his origin- is quite irrecon- '
cilable with scientific law. Pasiphae is
the creation of a morbid and' bestial
sentiment such as might exist among a
race of .shepherds.
Professor Emerson a-cribes to the myth
of Niobe a prehistoric origin. . He sup- |
poses that some prehistoric sculptor made !
a heroic statue of a woman 'out ci the [
rock in MountVSipyJuj. in Lydiu, and
left it. standing where it was made. Above j
the . statue, on a higher point in the 1
mountain, a spring of chalybeate water
ove.fi wed in the wet season, and from it i
a stream trickled down .and fell on the
woman's head. : Tims, to a distant or
careless observer she would appear to be
always weeping, and the rocks at her feet
might figure as ; her slaughtered children. 1
The -professor explains . the Noachian
flood as the remit ot the combined action
of a cyclone and an earthquake with a
tidal wave. Such waves are known to be
common in -the Persian Gulf. But it was j
hardly necessary to invoke the aid of j
either earthquake or cyclone. All myth- I
ologies and almost all early histories con
tain accounts of a deiuge in which human
life and human habitations were destroyed
by water. . 'ln ; - prehistoric tinr a no provi
sion -existed' for ; the overflow; of water
wbich accumulated in a valley, and river
outlets often proved insufficient to carry
eff the surplus. At the present day fresh
ets drown large areas of level land in the
Mississippi' and Missouri valleys, and all
the features of the Noachian deluge are
reproduced on â  a small scale. Similar
phenomena used to be witnessed in the
valley of the Rhone in France. '.P.-''

As a rule the children are. in their own
way. extremely ."pretty. The yellow,
parcbment-hke skin of later years is
in early youth exquisitely clear and
smooth, of ",,& pale, cream color, just
si aded with olive, and of a wonderfully
fine texture. Their eyes are bright and
intelligent, their hair, though coarse,
glossy and weli-ccred for, and even the
babies who can scarce stand steadily upon
their feet have a quaint air of dignified
reserve in the presence of strangers which
adds greatly to their infantile charm.
After the sixth birthday a great and sud
den change comes into a child's life.
Babyhood is past, and, according to the
traditions of their people, tbe time for
I work and study and discipline, strict, con- t
! slant and unrelenting, has arrived.
The first and last law, of a Chinese fam- j
ily is obedience â blind, unquestioning
and instant and the child who is careless '
for rebellious finds every misdemeanor '
visited with punishment as severe as it is
inevitable, and the patriarchal govern- |
! ment thus instituted continues through- j
I out the lifetime of the parents.
Disrespect shown toward older people is I
considered almost as an unpardonable sin, â¢
and a properly brought up child never '
dares to treat a grown person of his own j
race with other than the greatest defer- j
ence and politeness.'
Oddly enough, too, neither father nor j
mother obj.ct to their children being j

! snch domestic reproof. There is no j

believe; but it is quite possible that a long
continuance of heavy rains may have
submerged the plateau on which the
mountain; rests, which 'is only 5 3000 feet
above the sea. In Oriental countries alter- j
nations of freshets and droughts .are of
common occurrence. It is quite easy to
conceive a deluge so tremendous that its
record may have lingered in the traditions
of the place, and ; may have been trans
continuous, and, as the children soon
learn this and govern themselves accord
ingly, the homelife is, in the main, quiet
and pleasant. *
Although girls are considered 'in*' all
ways inferior to boys, they haye 1 many
privileges in our San Francisco Chinatown
which they would not have were they
born in the Flowery Kingdom. 7 Vv'r 1
While some of the poorest families vir
tually sell their small daughters by "hir
ing them out" for a term of years for a
lump sum, paid in advance, many Chi
nese send theirs to the public or mission
schools and give them. an equal chance
with their brothers as far as early educa
tion is concerned.
As pupils the children are said- by their
teachers to be equally bright, quick and
tractable. They particularly ' excel in
drawing from models and sketches, and
anything that requires an accurate and
observing eye and imitative ability, but
they are slow to originate or to apply ab
stract rules to actual practice. -
In the schools taught by the "Fong
Wai" they are fully as restless and. mis
chievous as white children; but in tbe
piesence of their Chinese instructors they
are models of deportment and assiduous
application to study. Moreover, they pay
their Chinese teachers the compliment of
wearing to their schools certain long blue
gowns, called "school gowns,", which are
supposed to be very "honorable" and to
place upon the shoulders of their wearers
a burden of personal dignity which is
well-nigh crushing.
A child who descends to anything ftp.
proacuing levity or light amusement
while arrayed in this garment becomes at
once an object of scorn and reproach to
his associates. But when, after a most
sedate walk home, the heavy responsi
bility of the gown is laid aside, the serious
and decorous student becomes instantly
metamorphosed into a shouting, jumping,
hilarious young, creature, whose aim
seems to be to get the greatest amount of
fun possible out of every spare hour that
raitted to posterity with noetic exaggera
tion. The story of the ark is common' the
world*' over* and Noah himself figures
under another name in many literatures.
. On the day after tne destruction of
Pompeii the sun was never seen, and the
sky was so clouded !bv ashes that even so
intelligent a philosopher as Pliny doubted
whether the end of the world bad not
come. The augurs were quite sure that it
passes over his shaven and queued head.
Â The sports of the Chinese children are
quite as various] and interesting as those
or their whito brothers and sisters.'? They
play with dolls, tops, marbles, balls and
kites in the same ways, and some of the
games which have been handed down to
tbem from centuries, long past are identi
cal with those played time out of mind by
our own young folks: f '
"Tag" they play with great zest, and as
they are very wary and fleet of foot the
child who occupies the position of "lock
moe," or "ii" as American children say,
finds' it a rather difficult and extremely
exciting task to capture any one to officiate
in bis ad. '
"Blind man's buff" is also played as
American children play it, with the excep
tion that it is considered absolutely neces
sary to use. for the "blinder" a silk hand
kerchief of the gny est colors.
.Many of the games played by boys and
girls together are something like those
played in our kindergartens. ' The chil
dren, whose voices though thin are gener-
ally sweet and clear, sing or chantjstanzas
descriptive of certain animals, persons or
events, accompanying the music with a
i series of movements, gestures or facial
contortions, intended to portray the same
clearly to the spectators. ,;;-;
: One of the oddest of these is called . the
'serpent game," in which a long line of
children weave in and out and under each
other's arms with a peculiar, gliding, un
dulating motion, until they are coiled up
in truly snakelike fashion, and then un
coil themselves in the same manner.
The play of "tack chai," or "kick stick,"
seems to, be an Oriental . form of "hop
scotch,", in which, however, no disfigura
tion of the pavement by chalk lines is
necessary.
f A light piece of wood is selected for the
"chai," and one party of boys kicks it
about with, surprising swiftness and ac
curacy of aim toward a goal, which they
are anxious to attain in as short a time
as possible, while an opposition party
had and plainly discerned in the phe
nomenon a proof tuat the pagan deities
were : enraged at the public neglect of
their altars. It was much easier, for, the
common plebeian to understand this than
to realize .that, the accumulated tufa of
twenty centuries had suddenly been
ejected { from the... volcano! and that ' it
occupied a large space in the air.

Tho game is called "tack yin" . in
Chinese, and the "yin" is either a fish
bladder inflated and ornamented with
feathers or a small suakeskin,. similarly
treated. The. many different. directions
in which a Chinese boy kicks during an
animated, game of tack yin is little short
of marvelous, and as his interest and- ex
citement increase his legs, which at first
seem to be . merely . rather unusually
limber, appear to become possessed of
joints' which turn in every imaginable
way without occasioning the slightest, in
convenience to their owner. He can "box

[ easily as an old sea-captain can with his
tongue, and be can even kick vigorously
and effectively with one leg twisted
around the other, when he feels like

"Teasing the dragon" is much en
joyed, and many of the wealthier chil
dren are the proud possessors of hideous
dragon's heads, hollow and gaudy with
gilding and brilliant paint, from which
hangs a voluminous curtain of red cloth.
Into one of these heads the child thrusts
his own, ana, the red cloth completely
enveloping his figure, becomes an object
more than startling to tho nerves, of any
one who happens upon him unexpectedly.
Two or three children arrayed like this
are pursued and playfully tormented by
their companions, but if they succeed in
catching any of their small persecutors

In the Grasp of a Python
jfltsfj HUGE Brazilian boa constrictor
i J-bI 1' which has ruled Black Point Key
J_X*_Â» for a long time has just been cap
tured by Professor Walter Ralston of the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington
who went there for the purpose. The snake
measured fifteen feet in length and
weighed fully seventy-five pounds. It is
supposed to have killed several persons
who landei on Blank Point Key and have
never since been heard of.
Professor Ralston tells a harrowing
story of his adventure with the snake and
it seems almost a miracle that he lived to
relate It. He watched the python with
out food or sleep for twenty-four hours
before the opportunity came which en
abled him to try to 'master it with some
possibility of success. The professor tells
in ' graphic language exactly what his
fortunes and misfortunes were.
"I have been working twenty-six years
in the interest of science," said he, "and
in all that time 1 had never experienced
an adventure so perilous as the one that
befell me on Black Point Key. ' I had
heard of a great snake being there before
I came here, and made up my mind that
it must be a specimen worth looking after.
The story as it came to me was that a
ship containing specimens from South
America for a circus in the United States
had foundered off. this coast, and it was
supposed that this snake, wh.ch was really
king of Black Point Key, had been a part
of the cargo of the ill-fated vessel.
"Black Point Key lies just off the coast
and at the edge of tbe Everglades. It is a
low ridge topped ' by a growth of pines.
While an island now it originally, was a
neck of land. The people who lived on
the adjacent keys were in a state of terror
regarding the snake, and in constant fear
that it would leave the key on which it
bad been for so long and pay them a .it,
and possibly eat them before. they could
do anything about it. The length of the
snake, they declared, was phenomenal,
and it' is an actual lact that a number of
men, who said they had seen it, were
willing to make affidavit. that it was fully
thirty- 1 ye feet long and must weigh at
least 100 pounds.
"I knew that no snake from South
America could be of that I ze, and so
fancied there must be a good deal of ex
aggeration. I made up my mind I would
at least take a look at the monster if I
could not capture it, and made two trips
to Black Point Key for the purpose. .
"I heard of the appearance of the snake
again soon after my second trip, and so
decided to make a third, attempt to
capture it. ..I went to _ that portion of
Black Point Key nearest the mainland.
If I could find the, snake there I knew I
wou d have a better fighting chance to at
tack it.. Fortune r seemed to be with , me
this time, 5 for I had barely landed when I i
found traces of tbe snake. I trailed it for
half a mile and at last came 'within sight
of it. It was a big one. I realized' that it
would be impossible to get the snake alive.
;'_ "1 thought the situation over and , con
cluded Â hat the^ only thing", for me "s to ! do
was .'to watch, and wait for my chance to
capture, it. I; knew I was fifteen miles
from the nearest person and that I might
cry for help as loud as I liked without the
slightest probability of any response. 7lt
seemed as if the snake knew I was watch
ing, for it kept as sharp an outlook as any
sna_e I ever saw. I waited until darkness
than it is with American children. No
two-legged steed, ramping and champing
ma twine harness, does for them ; their
horses are mostly of the* saddle variety,
and they have four 'legs, and lively ones,
every one of them. 7
7 Ii takes thrse boys two large and one
smallâ to "play horse" satisfactorily in
Chinatown. One of the former is the
head, shoulders and forelegs of the ani
mal. Another, bending at right angles,
places the top of his head in the "small"
of his comrade's back and, as they inter
lace their arms to keep steady, becomes at
once the body and hind legs of the horse.
The actual resemblance to a horse thus
produced is as comical as it is surprising,
and when the third boy climbs into the
saddle and proceeds to train bis -mettle
some charger the sight is one to bring
tears of laughter. to ths eyes of the veriest
misanthrope. This horse can kick and
rear and plunge and buck like the worst
tempered j Mexican mustang that ever un
willingly exchanged freedom for slavery,
but he can also amble as smoothly as a
lady's palfrey, and the "baby children"
are often treated to long and enjoyable
rides in this way by their kindly older
companions. % ,i >\ ;'7v 7. 77
The Chinese children are fond of pets,
white mice and rats, being their special
favorites, while poodle dogs and cats are
much liked. They are rarely cruel to any
animal and are not quarrelsome among
themselves.
The older children are early taught to
care for the younger ones, and whenever
two of the same family are seen together
the older child invariably has tbe hand of
the younger clasped closely in its own.
Even during study hours in school they
beg to be allowed this privilege of "hold
ing hands," which seems to give a feeling
of security and protection to tbe one and
a sense of. affectionate responsibility to
the other. Funegai- McVahos. .

came. It was impossible for me to do
I anything at night. Still I was afraid to
J go away, lest the snake should disappear,
I and it might be weeks before I could find
; it again.
"I got into ray canvas bag and remained
therethrough the night. When day
light came I resumed my watch, but the
snake was as wary us ever. The hours wore
away until it was nearly 2 o'clock. I had
been watching the snake twenty-four hours
j and in all that time had not slept a wink
!or eaten, or drank anything. Presently
I saw the snake move. A short distance
away was a rabbit and the snake went
after him and seized him and commenced
to swallow its victim.
''I waited a few moments until the
| rabbit had been lairly drawn into the
snake's throat, and then I went after. the
i boa. I seized it by the neck and tried to
shove it, head first, into the canvas bag.
I had underestimated the powers of my
adversary. I had supposed the snake
would be in such a state, owing to the
meal it was making, that there would be
little trouble in handling it; but before I
knew it I felt the snake folding around
my limbs.. In a marvelouuly short space
of time the reptile was about me as far as
the abdomen. I clung to its throat des
perately, realizing that if I once lost my
hold it would be like signing my death
j warrant and that I would be squeezed to
a jelly. ; ,
7 "lt is impossible for me to describe such
a frightful position. The snake turned its
head toward me and hissed in my face,
darting out its forked tongue as if it
| would pierce me with it. I expected to be
I slowly -queezed to death, but to my sur
prise the folds did not tighten, and then I
realized that owing to the position of the
rabbit in thesnake's throat the pressure of
my ; hands thereon was having an effect.
Bes'des this tbe snake was not seemingly
in tbe possession of .its full powers, al
though it kept up a continual hissing and
glaring at me with most malevolent eyes.
"Finally -I "squeezed the reptile's neck
with all tbe slrengtn of wbich I was capa
ble. ; To my joy, I. felt . the hold of the
snake upon me relax, and the coils slipped
down as they loosened. - I pushed the bead
and neck to the ground. Still keeping
one hand and my knee thereon I man
aged with the other to gain possession of
the knife at my belt. With this 1 soon
ended the snake's existence. -
"The snake was unlike "any other that I
ever saw. before, but ; I . am satisfied it was
a Brazilian python.", It was of a dull brown
in color, with black spots. Its head is
about four inches long '.and .three and a
half inches wide. Taken altogether, it
was as ugly a customer as I ever encoun
tered." 7' '; ' ' 7

"I'LL GO LOSE MYSELF"
Idyls of the Field
ItfiglWE ARE apt to think of the violet
ra\jre i fl& as a modest, shrinking flower.
itf/Ml'l loving deen, woodsy places and
secluded corners. This, certainly, is the
idea that the word violet brings to most
minds. Yet, a day or two ago, on the
chill top of a wind-swept mountain, where
a scant men of soil covers' the disinte
grating volcanic rock, I came upon such
a field of yellow violets as I have never
seen elsewhere. Fully an acre 'of the
sparse soil is covered with the tiny, close
snuggling plants, and the jolly, yellow
flowers, that look very like small, lost
oansies, are already nodding in the winds
that seem never wholly still on that bleak,
bare height.
I was quite lost when I came upon the
blossoms, and had been wandering for
three hours or more over the hills in the
endeavor to find a feasible trail bacK to
familiar haunts. All around me lay huge,
round, smooth, black bowlders, lichen
patched, moss-grown, polished here and
there by wind and weather. There was a
certain fantastic method in their arrange
ment. Some of them seemed to have been
arrested b,- an unknown power in the
very act of rolling away down the hillside.
It was hard to believe they were not held
back by some mystic force other than
gravitation.
As I wandered among them the convic
tion grew upon me that they were not
bowlder.* at all, but the enchanted army of
the old Arabian Nights story. I had come
by chance upon the magic hill, and pres
ently I encountered the golden enchanter
himself; for what hut an enchanter could
be the great wind-tossed oak, in the brave
yellow of early foliage â the only sylvan
dweller on all that mountain-top? Straight
out from a -mighty gray rock it sprang,
and in its growth it had split the stony
mass asunder. I could see its gnarly
black roots thrusting here and therein the
crevices, but I could not see that any of
them, piercing downward through the
rocky pile, found earth and moisture.
Yet there the tree stood, with its back to
the wind, its shoulders braced, its head
bent and ail its wide branches stretching
out like arms toward the enchanted princes
and their followers. Suppose s- me one
were to cut that tree down, would the spell
cease, do you think, and let the bowlders,
restored to life, go galloping down the
hill on their fiery steeds to release the
princess from durance vile? That were a
fine sight could one be there to behold it!
But I saw no lifting of enchantment. I
saw only the little yellow violet;-, grow
ing bravely about the bowlders and even
playing at the very feet of the enchanter
himself, and at the sight all my loneliness
sped away. The wee plants gave me cour
age and strength. There's no being lost
in such company.
How the wind blew! It seemed as if
ear low-growing blade and leaf needed
an anchor to keep it in the ground. One
could see even the great oak shiver now
and then in the blast. It was interesting
to note the growths upon the hilltop.
Even the weeds were as short as though
cropped close. The buttercups blossomed
upon stems not more than an inch or two
long. The altileria spread out in rosettes,
lying close to the ground, and the grasses
were small and fine. Everything was
close-reefed, so to speak, and made snug
against the beating winds. B_P_H
It seemed strange to see the little brown
flycatchers up here, yet several were toss
ing about . in the wind, and. seeing me,
darted beneath a clump of stunted south
ernwood and lupin, where I could hear
them scolding as I worked getting some
roots of the violets for v transplanting.
The ground was so stony I could scarcely
get my trowel in, but the long white roots |
of the plant crept in and out everywhere
among the broken rock. Far below me
two huge hawks suddenly left their perch
in a dead tree and began wheeling up
ward until they passed within a few feet
of my head. I caught the flash of the
bright, fierce eyes of one and noted that
as they flew the birds turned their heads
from side to side, surveying the scene be
low.
It was fascinating to watch them. I
Fisher /\mes orv the Whist LaWs.
No name amoig the whist-players of this
country is bitter known than Fisher Ames'.
He is without doubt one of the leading whist
authorities of the world, and whatever comes
from his pen will, command the attention of
ail lovers of the noble game. The following
letter will te read with great Interest:
P. J. Tormey, Chairman Committee on Whist
Lavsâ Dear Sir: In reply to your favor I beg
to say that J earnestly hope the whist code, as
it stands to-day, wtil be allowed to stand with
' out material alteration.
It is in most respects a perpetuation of the
Portland Club code, but improved in several
important respects. It has been the governing
code now for aree or four years and whist
players are used to It. Stability in our laws
is of very great importance. There may be
points where there is a difference of opinion,
but there can be no difference as to this. It is
better that so-called improvements be omitted
than to have the present structure disturbed.
The laws as to exposed cards may not be per
fect, but It would be very difficult to make
them any more so.
The committee worked for three years over
these laws and considered this matter of cards
liable to be called very careluliy. I hope the
new committee will go slow. I think, how
ever, that one or two verbal changes might be
made to advantage and I venture to suggest
them:
Law 1 might read: "A game consists of seven
points. Each trick taken above six counts
one," etc. p.
The rresent language is not definite enough.
' 'Each trick abovo six counting one" is an in
terpolated clause and might be considered as
merely hypothetical, whereas I think it should
be a positive assertion.
Law 14, I: If any card is faced in the packâ
on^.!!â¢, words "except the last," as they are
not only unnecessary, but In conflict with law
11. If the meaning is that the dealer turns
and thus â¢â¢faces" the last card the words are
*till unnecessary, for the card is not faced In
the pack, nor, in fact, is it "faced" at all until
the deal ends by its being turned face up in
accordance with law 13.
LÂ»w 10â "Any one. dealing," etc., "may be
stopped before the trump card "is turned.
Alter | the trump csrd has been turned," etc.
The expression. "after which" is awkward and
grammatically perfect, and I thin* it would
be better to change it as above. â¢
As you â¢ sett, these ' suggestions â¢ are merely
verbal. - I should seriously regret any change
iv the substance of toe laws and hope uout:
will be made. , Very, truly yours, .

, A JMce ; Point ir\ Jrump . play^ ;
The following deal was played by the St.
| had never before sÂ»en these birds in flight
J save at such a distance below them mat
they looked like mere specks against the
sky; but this time there was a full minute
daring which 1 watched their backs as
they circled up the air. They seemed to
use their wings more than is apparent
when they are seen from below, but this
was probably because they were not soar
ing as in the upper air, but climbing al
most directly upward, with quick strokes
of their broad pinions, which spread out
a full yard from tip to tip as they flew.
They were a handsome pair, for pair I
judged them to be. Looking through the
glass, I could make out in a forked branch
of the dead tree below a dark mas?, wbich
was, in all probability, their nest.
The hawks may have been looking for
ground squirrels. The stony hilltop was
riddled with openings into the burrows of
these little creatures, and at one such
opening on a sheltered slope, running
himself and blinking in the bright light, I
I 6aw a small, light-brown spotted owl.
I got a good look at him before he saw
me and retired, very politely, bacKward
into the hole. The disappearance had
really a funny air of extreme courtesy.
The small bird seemed very much at
home, and possibly the squirrel-hole may
have been an abandoned one into which
he bad moved and set up housekeeping,
or he may have been visiting there, as
these owls sometimes seem to do, sojourn
ing for a season and even going so far as
to make 'an occasional meal off their en
tertainer's young family.
Owls, to a bird, are rather inclined to
indolence and love ease better than they
love the labor of acquiring it by their own
exertions, and so it often happens that we
see them established in the deserted quar
ters of other birds and animals. An owl
of ray acquaintance used to live in a wood
pecker's hole in a redwood tree, and an
other dwelt in a rat's nest in the barnloft,
making bis exits and his entrances through
a hole tbe rodents bad gnawed in the wall.
During heavy weather, if caught abroad,
they take refuge in all sorts of queer
places. One morning, after an unex
pected snowstorm, a year ago, I found a
pretty little horned owl in my stove. He
probably sought shelter in the chimney,
and, falling through the flue, fluttered
down the pipe. He seemed not at all
alarmed when discovered, but sprang out
and sat quietly upon the floor until I
opened the door, when he flew forth into a
tree. Doubtless, however, he had great
tales to tell his comrades of his remar-a
able adventure. ,
Securing my violets I wended my way
around the bill, minded to cross a canyon
and climb an opposite eminence where,
in the distance, I could see a familiar
. iooking range of fringing trees climbing
the slope. We human beings are not so
clever as the bees. T.esc little creatures
can take their hearings from the densely
growing tops of forest trees and fly
straight home across them, while we
must laboriously blaze ways and make
trails, and if, peradventure, we cross a
hilltop or a ravine and let down one pair
of bars rather than another, we are lost,
forsooth, and must needs go about making
a great to-do, until haply we find our
selves again. Sometimes, as a matter of
fact, we are lost and never know it, wan
dering footloose among the valleys and j
mountains and deep canyons of theory
and speculation, calmly confident that we
are going somewhere. It is only once in
a while that a dim suspicion visits us as
to whether we are after all on the right
track. Ten to one if, then, we do not
stop, look about us a bit, rub our mental
eyes, say "hence we infer," and start on
again.
I've lived, now, some good-sized num
ber of years in this world, and the chief
est conclusion I have come to is that the
great majority of us have but a vague
idea of our whereabouts. I question if \
one out of five hundred of us has any j
definite purpose and goal in the ful- I
fillment of which he is steadily mov- j
ing and acting. We know the purposes,
the goals we want to have in view; per
haps we know those we ought to have,

a situation that often arises and that ought to j
I be grasped by any. good player, the play of j

but there are multiform and multifarious
obstacles in the way of our pursuring
these. 1 Principal among them is, perhaps,
our humanity. The human being who
purposes a destiny, who marks out for
himself a career, must set this, in a meas
ure, aside. He must not be turned from
his way by minor considerations. If he
is. if he hesitate*, he is lost. Perhaps
about the moot any one of us can do is to
move along so as best to get over the
ground without hindering any other one;
to "do good and communicate forget
not." We find ourselves, after all,
through human fellowship, the fellow
ship of that which makes us human, and
which we hold from the divine,
i It is the multitude of personal posses
sions that makes it possible for us to get
lost. A lost bee, away from the wealth
and possessions of the hive, ia a sorry
sight. Ants sometimes get lost, and can
not find their way back to the hid treas
ures of grain and cattle (for ants keep cat
tle) and millet seeds, and not even the
sluggard could grow wise considering the
ways of a lost ant. But who can conceive
of a lost bird? He cannot be lost, for the
whole realm of the air is his. He makes
long journeys by night ana rests by day
among his trees. The world is his, in
general, and therefore he is always at
home. Not one tree of it is his in per
sonal, and therefore he is free, and wher
ever he is be holds his title by nature's
gift, "in fee simple ab:olute."

Sad Result of a
Sudden Hug.
A very amusing occurrence alternately
delighted and saddened a crowd of pas
sengers on an electric-car of the Mission
street line a few nights since. About 6
o'clock or a little later the cars are
nightly crowded. The passengers stand
as thick as sardines in a box inside and
on the outside of tbe cars many, often
standing on the platforms. Men and
women are wedged, with their satchels,
bags and bundle., into a close mass, sway
ing back and lortb in unison as the car
starts or stops. Within the last few
nights a younghusband, whose, name it
would be cruel to print, has been getting
on a car about 6 p. m. between Third and
Fourth streets and riding out to the
vicinity of Twentieth.
There be alights and goes home like a
new and dutiful husband, laden with
; delicacies to please his wife. On the
night of the occurrence herewith re
corded Mr. Younghusband had in his
hand a small paper bag, which he ban
dled very gingerly in retting in among
the crowd. He secured a place in the
back part of the car near the unused
motor. In the harrow space between the
seats were two other persons, the con
ductor and a large and jovial man, who
had evidently been drinking. The car,
suddenly starting and stopping, caused
the large man to lurch about like a small
boat in a heavy cross sea, but he managed,
nevertheless, to keep bis feet very well for
a time.
By and by the car stopped to let off a
mother and three young children. Some
time was consumed in getting tbis pre
cious human cargo out. The mother was
slow, the children slower, and the crowd
impeded. The car was late and both the
motorman and the conductor were pain
fully aware of the fact. They fretted and
fumed and were ready to start up with a
rush as soon as that was permissible. The
conductor rang the bell; the motorman
turned on the power. â¢Â»
"We're off," chuckled the inebriated
man.
"Good," said Mr. Younghusband, look
ing at nis watch and thinking of the wait
ing teatable and trim form of the wife.
Clang! clang! clang! Some foolish per
son tried at this minute to cross the track.
The motorman pulled up with great sud
denness. â¢ .7.7.
Forward lurched the big man with the
WHIST
and deuce with East and plays jack, a false
card, In order to confuse East and induce him
to win the trick with queen; as a matter of
fact this is just what East did, .but we have
changed the play to better illustrate the point
under consideration; East can; place the ten
and seven with North and knows that if he
overtrumps he must lose both the other
tricks by leading up to North's tenace; he
therefore undertrumps and North is compelled
to give up both of the last two tricks to East.
" Gav>er\dish " a Short-Suiter?
Tne whist editor of the New Yore Evening
Post, Mrs. Margaretta Wltherell Wallace, gives
the short-suiters a bard nut to crack in a re
cent issue of that journal. She says:
Terhaps the Â» boldest of the many impudent
claims of the short-suiters Is that they have a
sort of patent right to the exclusive use of the
strengthening card. Presuming that the whist
world at - large is not cony rsant with the litera
ture and history of the game, they have had the
; audacity to lay claim to this lead as an invention
of their own. .Now, one has only to I c familiar

lime at that date, being found in several earlier edi
tions. The exact words of the writer on this sub
ject are as follows: â¢'When it is your fata to open

There was a cracking sound, but not of

Mr. Younghusband and his little paper
bag, which had collapsed, at once. Mr.

.udden fear. 7 When the big man drew
away the front of his coat and vest was
dripping with a yellow liquid.

"Eggs," said the fat man, with a fierce
frown. .
"Let me off here," said Mr. Younghus
band to the conductor, and .he made his
exit hastily.
The conductor glanced at the street
corner.
"First time he ever got off at Twelfth
street," he said, with a wink.
The big man looked unutterable things.
How Telephones
Are Tickled
"Tickling the telephone" is a compara
tively new diversion in San Francisco,
but it already has several votaries. - The
nickel-in-the-slot attachment to tele
phones, which was devised to automat
ically register the number of switches, is
the cause. Never a manufacturer of com
plicated mechanism devises a "burglar
proof safe" but the alert and ingenious
cracksman is found ready to match wits.
The nickel-in-the-slot telephones are small
game, but they have prompted local in
genuity to exert itself to "beat the
game."
There is another application of the same
sort of ingenuity which sets the nickel-in
the-slot music-boxes to going simply by
poking a straw through an aperture. Some
people with seared and . hardened con
sciences have been known to while away
the tedium of waiting for a late boat at
the ferries witb a whole concert of the in
strumental sort provoked and provided
wholly through the use of a straw. But
the nickel-in-the-slot telephones cannot
be "tickled with a straw," as Shakespeare
prophetically wrote. It is necessary to
have something which will start the
"buzzer" like a falling nickel.
"Don't you want to use the telephone?"
was a question which surprised a Call re
porter yesterday.
"Why?" was asked in response.
"Oh, perhaps you'd like to test our in
vention," was the answer.
With this tne : person who was so free to
offer the use of the telephone brought out
a nickel soldered on the end of a long
wire. He took tho "phone" from the
hook and listened to hear tbe telephone !
girl say, "Drop a nickel, please."
When this familiar utterance was made ;
he smiled maliciously and inserted the
nickel and the wire in the slot and j
pushed down. The machine buzzed and I
the experimenter was compelled to ask '
some questions of the person at the other [
end of the wire as a prnalty. This may
explain much irrelevant conversation
that goes on over the telephone lines.
These practices have led telephone man
agers to threaten to discontinue the use
of the slot machines.
Easter FioWers.
The rosea were the first to hearâ
The roses trellised to the tomb;
Bring rosesâ hide the marks of spear
And cruel nails that scaled His doom.
The lilies were the first to seeâ
The lilies on that Easter room ;
Bring liliesâ crowned with blossoms be
Tho head so lately crowned with thorn.
The roses were the first to hear;
Ere yet the dark had dreamed of dawn,
The faintest rustle reached their ear;
They heard the napkin downward drawn;
They listened to the breathing low;
His feet upon the threshold tall.
Bring rosesâ sweetest buas that blow.
His love the perfume of them all.
The lilies were the first to sea ;
They, watching in the morning gray,
Saw angels come so silently
And roll tho mighty stone away ;
They saw Him pass ihe portal's gloom;
He brushed their leavesâ happy dower I
Bring liliesâ purest buds that bloom,
His face reflected in each flower.
The roses were the first to hear.
The lilies were' the first to see;
Bring fragrant flowers from far and near
To match the Easter melody!

And every heart the rapture share

Whist at GenterVille.
Charles W. Riser and H. L. Emerson carried
off the prizes in the whist tournament just
held in Centerville. .
The game was rather a unique one. Nine
pairs entered and each pair nad to play a.
match with each other pair, the game or
match to consist of 25 points straight whist.
Mr. Riser and Emerson won six matches, and
were only four points won ahead of E. Thomp
son and T. VVitherly of Irvington, who came
out second.
Straight whist for match games is no con
test of skill whatever without the number of
points per game is great enough to have luck
average up. If Mr. Riser will only keep up his
good work he wlii soon get the boys interested
in duplicate whist, and then they will ask
themselves "How was it we stuck to straight
whist so long?"

MINES
& MINERS
CTIJSLHE State Board of Trade displays a grout
r-I.C'â mauy exhibits In its extensive hall on
jjy 1^ Post street, and among them is a very
noticeable one of the negative class. It i** that
of the -lack in mining .counties of sufficient
enterprise to install 'n this little California
perpetual exposition attractive and fairly
representative exhibits of the mining, re
sources of those counties.
The exhibit of the State Board of Trade
should include a mining exhibit from every
mining county in the State. The display of
what the Slate can do In the horticultural
and agricultural line is superb, widely known
and Is continuing to he as it has long been,
a very effective means of advertising and pop
ulating the affiliating counties, which have
contributed exhibits. But there Is a very
slight representation of tne | great | mining
industry. But five counties have made any
attempt to show that they have any mineral
resources worth inquiring into, and these do
not amount to very much.
The best one, such as It is, is from Nevada
County, and it makes a very lavoraMe im
pression. The four, other counties, Shasta,
Placer, Calaveras and Amador, are repre
sented by some spec mens of quartz under the
pickled fruits, and the exhibits fail to particu
larly Interest or to suggest Ihe great and
varied stores of mineral wealth of which these
counties are so proud and hopeful. None of
the other counties to which mining means so
j much have any exhibits at all. Those that are
in place are there because there was a Mid
| winter Fair some time ago, and .Secretary
I Fiicher had these fragments hauled in from
j the park.
I The point is that the State Board of Trade
I Is a highly efficient advertising medium. for
counties and this is an opportune time for
| counties to advertise their mining develop
ment and possibilities at triflng cost. The
I time is opportune because of the constantly
j accelerated movement of capital and enter
-1 prise toward the gold fields. A much greater
j proportion of those who make inquiries of the
! State Board of Trade in person or by letter are
i interested in mining than two or three years
ago. There is a constant stream of visitors
from all over the world to the State Board of
Trade exhibit. Many inquiries about mining
matters are made, and Secretary Filcner gives
the information wanted, or refers them to the
Mining Bureau or elsewhere. Mining has
never been an important feature of the v.ork
of this institution, but it might be made so
with a little effort in the mining counties.
The mining resources of every county are
well illustrated in the big museum of the State
| Mining Bureau, but there . the identity of a
j county is lost in the mass. .-It is a State ex-
I hibit. On Post street each county exhibit
I would be independent and effective for its ad
! vertising purpose. A varied display of mm!
-! eral specimens effectively labeled, and a
I showing of pictures and maps, with possibly
mine models and relics, would excite the in-
I terested attention of every visitor.
Secretary Fiicher. would like to see this done
| and, also, that indispensable accompaniment,
pamphlets on each county's resources in
which the mineral resources and possibilities
ot each mining county are described with
fitting emphasis. Only two counties provide
printed information concerning mines. This
is the time for every mining region to shove Its
chief industry to the â¢ front, and the â  State .
Board of Trade presents a valuable opportu- 1
tuntty to the mining counties, r
John Muir, who ls ever alert in the cause of
f.ire.t preservation, vigorously defends in the
Mining and Scientific Press President Cleve
land's extensive reservations of timber lands,
and Editor John 1). McGHilvray of that paper
thus discusses the relations of the new policy
to the mining industry: ;: . : 77
"Miners and prospectors generally know
that these, reservations will prevent large
companies from ruining the source of supply
of timber for the mines and be of the greatest
benefit to them.
"The commission upon whose report these
reservations were created concedes that it will
be Impossible to maintain them unless some
provision shall be made which will permit
citizens to search for and develop valuable
. mineral ledges and deposits and to utilize the
timber within reasonable limitations.
"If this provision is made the miners should
consider the reservation of these forests by
the Government tne greatest boon thai could i
be conferred upon iheir Industry. There is
many an old and still prosperous mining dis
trict on the Pacific Coast that is now suffering
through the extravagant and wasteful man
ner in which tho timber of the immediate
neighborhood has been cleared off without
regard to the future. Many a mine is paying
now twice as much for timber as it would had
the neighboring forests been carefully con
served and the timber taken irom them
wisely." . .
A. S. Cooper, the new State Mineralogist,
took possession of the offica on Thursday last,
and this year's field work is now fairly under
-'â¢ It can be seen between the lines that some
one with practical experience is at the head of
this movement. Whist clubs, like all new
organizations, have a bard row to hoe during
the first twelve months of their existence, but
once safely through that period their success
Is assured.

In regard to the Provincial Miners' Associa

tion to H. E. Croa-daile, general manager of
the Hall Mines (Limited). Such a society is
urgently needed, because the members sent
by the people to the local Parliament are ab
solutely useless. They know nothing of state
craft, of bill-drafting, even of the require
ments of their own district beyond a road here
or a bridge there. They owe their positions to
party influence, and in no way whatever rep
resent the tremendous Interests that are being
developed in their districts. The new associa
tion, on the other hand, is already composed
of leading mining men who know what they
want, are thoroughly acquainted with the
nature of. their business and how it is con
ducted in other countries, and they also have
the means to make themselves heard."THE
STAGE
ST wants exactly ten minutes to 8
o'clock, and the stage manager of the
_$ French Opera Company is standing
behind the curtain, a bit: carpenter's ham
mer in one hand and a gold watch in the
other, counting the minutes, in order not
to miss the right one to give three strokes
on the boards for the overture to "Rigo
letto" to commence. I have been warned
that it would be well to keep out of the
way of the ftage manager his temper is
not as mild and sweet as honey, and he
bates to admit strangers into his domain.
But it is no use; the stage manager has
singled me out among the crowd of cory
phees, chorus-sinirers and men in armor
who are strolling about, arm in arm, as
unconcernedly as if th-y were at a prom
enade concert. His lynx eyes detect me
treading on an electric wire and brushing
against the gauzy skirts of the pretty Ital
ian dancer. Mite, de Biazi. There is noth
ing for it but an introduction and explana
tions. "You can remain, but certainly â "
his lips rem.-*""!". His surprised look seems
to- say:- "These Americans â what will
they not do nex '.' Could she not have
written up the performance from before
the footlights? Quest cc qu'elle fait dans
cette galere-ci?"
Bang, bang, bang! The stage manager
pounds on the stage with his hammer a
la mode Francaise and the orchestra re
sponds with the opening bars of "Rigo
letto." I make a hasty descent into the
wings among the crowd of people who
form part of the army necessary to pro
duce grand opera. v Here is M. d'Alle
sandri, the ballet-master, standing by the
head electrician, snapping his fingers and
waving his cane to the coryphees who are
forming into line, smiling toward the cur
tain and giving demure side glances in
his direction, like the Queen in "Hamlet,"
with "one dropping and one auspicious
eye." Here ate the shoemaker ready to
put in a stitch at any moment, a costumer
waiting to repair a rent and a crowd of
other helpers whose special missions 1
have not time to ask for, for the principals
are beginning to assemble.
. Albers, in his jester's dress, towers
above every one else in the wings; Mas-art,
gorgeous in the costume of the Duke of
Mantua, sallies forth from his dressing
room singing part of the garden scene at
the top of his voice. He is followed by a
quiet little woman, as demure in her dress
as he is resplendent. It is Mme. Massart,
and every look and touch shows that she
idolizes her tenor. She smooths down
the satin of his doublet, to be sure that it
is not creased, tenderly pats the little
points of his collar and hastens to shake
out a bit of lace that has become dis
arranged. When there is nothing more
that can possibly be done to his toilet
abe gazes at him in silent -adoration, occi
sionally tendering him a little tin cup,
from which he takes a sip of the contents.
Massatt receives the homage as a matter
of course. He sees nothing but himself,
hears nothing but himself, as he strolls up
and down the coulisses, testing those in
flexible knee joints of his, which are more
rigid than ever to-night in their casings of
white leather. "Ta, ta, ta," warbles Mas-
Bart, shitting from one foot to -another.
Ah! but the opera has begun. Massart is
going too far even for a popular tenor. Is
it permissible for him to break upon the
actual performance that he may test his
notes? The stage manager rushes up with
indignant protest written on the very curl
of his mustache. "C'est commence, eh !"
he his*es at the warbling Massart, point
ing to the stage. He still holds the big
hammer. He could brain Massart with
case, but tho tenor is used to such -en
counters. He look-, straight through the
Mage manager with a cold and glassy
stare, as if he and his hammer were a pane
of glass, and Massart takes a deep interest
in something that he could perceive
through them in the far, far distance.
Mme. Massart hastens to her tenor's side
with the tin cup, burnt over tho gas.' Mas
sart quaffs a sip of the nectar and marches
on the stage to the sound of applause
from the other side of the footlights.
No one seems to remonstrate with Mile.
Berthet, who is trilling away in her lose
as gayly as a lark. They tell me that the
soprano lepgero is a favorite with every
one in the troupe, but the most popular
of all the prima donnas is Andree Savine,
who has just entered, wrapped in furs
and followed by a little yellow dog. She
is made ud for the stag* and wears a thick
black veil through which her glorious
* Vu * shine like luminous stars. "1 play
Madeleine," she remarks, half pitlieti
c-:ly; "the part is so disagreeable because
Madeline does not come on till late and
1 am tired before it is the hour to sing.,' r
Savtne's English is the admiration of
every one connected with the theater. I
asked her to speak it. "Ah ! je Ie parle si
peu," she says, half apologetically, and
then, with a mischievous glance, rattles
off her whole vocabularyâ "'Ow do you
do?"â " We. take a walk"â "l like "this
placo"â "Good- by." "C'est tout," she
adds merrily, and hurries off to her dress
ing-room, leaving the impression that
Mme. Savine is tout a fait charmante.
The impresario rejoices in the uncom
mon surname of Charley. Between the
acts he gives me his opinion of opera in
San Francisco. "It is astonishing, per
fectly astonishing," he says, "that in a
town of the weahh of San Francisco, there
is no real opera-house. Look at New
Orleansâ poorer than San Francisco, less
importantâ but they have the finest opera
house in the United States. The Metro
politan? _sah! the Metropolitan is not
so good for opera as the New Orleans
Opera-house. They have every modern
appliance there for changing the scenery â
as good appliances as in the best European
opera-houses. Here we have nothing,
nothing!" 7
He waves his hands contemptuously
toward the scenery, which is being put in
place according to the somewhat primitive
methods whicn prevail in San Francisc >.
"It may do in comedy, to set scenery
bo," he says, "but for opera, never!
Besides, in a little theater like this, the
public almost brushes against the artists,
and there are not enough cheap places,
not enough, boxes. .An opera-house for
San Francisco should not have less than
ci hty boxes. -. '-â¢'""/ 7 â¢â¢-.
"If this City would build a real opera
house, and would combine with New Or
leans, you might have a_\ splendid three
months' season of opera every year. It
would pay to bring 'out great artists for
the two seasons,' l>-.t th* remoteness of
San Francisco makes it impossible to se
cure great artists for a season here alone.
Eighty or ninety subscribers would in
sure the management against actual loss.
In New Orleans this year, we had $50,000
paid in subscriptions alone, and New Or
leans is poorer t.an San Francisco."
''It is not without interruptions that
Charley makes these remarks. An im
presario's lot is to be complained to by
every with a grievance, and. artists
arc seldom without grievances; - Albers,
who has been lying in wait to get Charley
alone, breaks in impatiently at this point,
saying: "Charley, cannot you give mo a
dressing-room to myself? Here are Mas
sart and I crowded in "together and can
not turn round, c'est trop X fort.'.' "But,"
says Charley protesting, "can I manu
facture dressing-rooms? "We have 130
people, and do you know how many dress
ing-rooms?' .."No, and I. don't care. 71
want a; room to myself, I must have a
room to myself," replies Albers, and he
swings round on his heel and. disappears
muttering? tragically, "c'est trop iortâ
trop â fort." (.
I think of- the, adoring Mme. Massart,
and the Utile tin cup heated over the gas,
and it strikes me that Albirs is entitled to
profound sympathy for being thrust un

sought upon the Ma--Bart family. His
presence ccmpels Mme. Massart to wan
der about outside, her husband's lose be
tween the acis. like a lost spirit, while her
tenor is struggling into his -costumes, and
getting them on-all. awry, with creases in
the satin, and the lace ruffles crushed. . If
Alders were absent, she could go in and
smooth out the creases in the satin, pat
the lace into looking its best, ana make
her tenor point device, intead of having to
put the finishing touches in the wings be
fore the unfeeling eyes of the chorus and
the ballet. If Albers bad another room
.he might even set up light housekeeping
in the loge, and cook the tenor beeisieaks
over the gasâ there is no end to the com*
fort that might be provided for cc cher
tenor if Albers were not as ever-present as
Banquo's ghost No wonder Albers
makes his changes of costume as quickly
as possible, and spends the rest of the
time between the acts prowling around
the coulisses murmuring, "C'est trop
fort â tropâ fori."
One dressing-room (tho most commodi
ous of the whole suite) is closed with lock
and key, and people tread softly as they
pass it Iy. There is no crowding here, no
disputed possession. The falcon of the
troupe holds the fort, and Charley knows
better than : to thrust any one upon her.
The car ion thÂ° door bears the names,
."Mme. Foedor, Mile. Aimee Pascal," but
Pascal has never set loot in the room ; she"
never will unless Ie bon Dieu chooses to
take a band in matters, and sends madame
a trifling accidente, as the Sicilians say,
which will give her understudy a chanc.
to sing. The beautiful Pascal dreams by
night and by day of owning that room
for just one performance of "La N'âvar
raise." She pictures how she wilt put on
Anita's simple black dress, and taking a
lingering, backward glance at her own
loveliness in the long mirror she will step
out on the stage and conquer San Fran
cisco. â¢-- - -
Foedor is not singing to-night. She i-<
in a box, looking much handsomer off the
stage than she does on, and Mile. Pascal
is at her hotel, dreaming no doubt a little
more hopelessly than usual of triumphs
that seem destined' not, to come. Sue
knows that the bills for the final per
formances have all been made out and
her name does not iigure thereon.
I fear to meet Albers, because it would
be jileasautcr to carry always in my mind
the impression of the men's great f art
without shattering the illusion by coming
iii contact, with his personality. No more
faith in opera-singers' devotion to their
art is left in me. \ I have known too many
fal'-oiis. tenon as-oluti,-* et a!. * Under
Italy's sunny skies and in London's fog,
in barn-storming troupes and in historic
op -ra- houses', I. have always found 7 that
the letter ' Iâ a great redlt-tter J Iâ blinds
their eyes to everything else on earth or
in heaven. The letter 1 represents art to
them. Their motto is: "If I succeed, art
triumphs; if I fail, art is uecadent. "
Other artists have their little vanities, but
"as moonlight unto sunlight and as water
unto wine" is the vanity of virtuosi to the
vanity of opera- singers. 77
Well, l meet Albers, and one of bis first
remarks is. the eager question : "Have
you had my picture as Hamlet yet? I
should lice to have it put in The Sunday
Call. Hamlet is one of my favorite roles,
and I want the public to see me in my
costume." A guileless little ambition
enough, but henceforth when I see his
fine acting and hear his rich voice and bis
delightful phrasing those words will come
unbidden to my mina, "I should like the
public to see me in my costume:"
Mabie Evelyn.
Baldwin ' Jheater.
An interesting theatrical event to-mor
row night will be Otis Skinner's produc
tion of a new original romantic play
called "A Soldier of Fortune," which is
from his own pen. The scenes of the play
are laid in Italy at the beginning of the
sixteenth century, a period of history
which offers many opportunities for
quaint stage settings and handsome cos
tumes. 'ihe plot deals with the adven
tures of Fabian Torreli, a soldier in the
French army wbich is trying to conquer
Italy from the north.
Toreili is drummed out of his regiment
because he is too chivalrous to clear him
self from a charge of theft which would
implicate a woman. He is befriended by
the famous Florentine statesman Macchia
velli and meets with many- romantic ad
ventures, both in Florence and Rome.
"A Soldier of Fortune" will run for five
nights. At the Saturday matinee "Romeo
and Juliet" will be produced, and on Sat
urday evening a Shakespearean double
bill will be given, the plays being portions
of "The Merchant of Venice" and ."The
Taming of the Shrew.".

her first appearance at the Columbia as a
star. Her repertoire will consist of a
number of plays, all of which are new to

fflTS* HE open season for trout fishing be
Â«iv Kan on Thursday and already a
jlfp great many of the lovers of this
genuine and exciting sport have left for
their favorite streams. ,
Contiguous to San Francisco, so near in
fact that a day's fishing is always accessi
ble, there are numberless streams that
abound in trout. In all those streams that
flow from the western slopes of Tamalpais
fishing of the most exhilarating character
is to be had by those who have the
right either from ownership or as a mem
ber of the Country Club, which as lessees
jealously exclude the public from a great
tract which affords probably the finest
trout-fishing in the vicinity of San Fran
cisco. There are, however, numberless
atieams in Marin and Sonoma counties
which are distant but a few hours' travel
by rail and afford rare sport-

About the California Golony in tne
Eastern Metropolis
NEW YORK, N. V., March 30.â "Where
are you going this summer?"
Easterners begin to ask each other that
question before the snow is melted away
from shady nooks and when great chunks
of river ice are bumping and fighting their
way to the sea. The trees are still bare
and brown, but the little waxy buds of
promised leaves are silent signals that
spring will soon be with us. However.it
teems strange to a Californian to hear the
typical New Yorker planning for the
summer months before daisy-starred
spring swoops down over us.
Lent is swinging along in a jolly little
manner, and many pretty luncheons and
lavender teas are beingcecorded as unu
sually delightful. There have been a half
dozen different sorts of shows for charity
and private gain. Perhaps the most pop
ular affair among the lovely ladies of the
450 was the doll show, which took place
last week at tue Waldorf.
Dolls, however beautiful they may be,
look absolutely funny when rigged out in
the finery my lady Dame Fashion dictates
that human dolls shall wear from season
to season. The dollies at the "Waldorf
made a very dignified showing, however,
and though their little arms would appear
angular and their staring eyes seem actu
ally impertinent at times they served the
purpose of illustrating the remarkable in
genuity and taste of our American tailors
and modistes.
. Three of the leading Broadway theaters
have changed their bills during the past
week. The Bostoniansâ "the only and
original"â opened at the Knickerbocker
Monday night in their new opera, "The
Serenade." It has proven an instanta
neous success, and nothing the Bostonians
bave given us since "Robin Hood" has
met with such -an enthusiastic reception.
At Waiiack's a musical skit called
"Miss Manhattan" has not met with the
popularity that has been looked for. It is
tue regulation potpourri of the regulation
comic opera. A dash of ginger and a long
wait between courses, old jokes with new
caps and' bells, and new jokes a wee bit
timid as to how they will be gobbled by
the patient public just across the foot

The Broadway Theater has jumped out
of the rut of everlasting burlesque and
comic opera, and is for the nonce the
home of classic and artistic drama.
"L'Arlesienne" (The Woman of Arle) is
at present attracting the attention of the
critics and students of drama.
.Written by the unhappy Alphonse Dau
det it is necessar.ly a gloomy and somber
story, but nevertheless it throbs with the
tenderness ot an anxious mother's love
and palpitates with human passions. To
add to the artistic triumph the play and
its perfect Arcadian scenery, there is the
dominant spirit of music sounding through
every scene. The original :entr'acte mu
sic by Georges Bizet is used as interpreted
by the great leader Anion Seidel and his
assistant, Ernest Meyer.
The music, with its passionate languor
ous strains, its deep swelling notes of anger
and /revenge, and at last the . crash . of
sound concordant, commingling life, love,
misery and tragic death, .is marvelous.
The last curtain falls on a dismal scene,
and the audience stumbles out on noisy
Broadway wondering why life isn't all
"beer and skittles," as the late lamented
Trilby expressed it. 7

The Lagunitas and its affluents on the
North Pacific Coast is a splendid stream
open to all, and is very popular with local
fishermen. Almost every mile or two
there is to be found hotels of the most
satisfactory character.where the weary can
find comfortable quarters and secure rest
and refreshments after the bard day's
tramp over the rocks and through the
tangled brush. The skillful angler is
sure of a good basket on the Lagunitas.
A few .miles un the road are the San
Antonio and Estero Americano creeks,
which have been especially stocked, and
during the right stage of the water the
trout run in myriads. Valley Ford and
Tomales. both thriving little towns, are
the headquarters of many sportsmen who
have tramped over this ground for years.

J. G. Mallory of San Francisco arrived
at the Gllsey House on Monday. He will
be in the city a week more. . .
Hon. Harrison Gray Otis, editor of the
Los Angeles Times, left for his southern
home last Saturday. He has had a long
visit in and about New York, and will re
turn to California with renewed forces and
pleasant memories of a very enjoyable
eventful Rejourn in Eastern cities.
Colonel Z. S. S. Sailing has been a guest
at the Holland during the past ten days.
He will probably start West this week.
George M. Bowman and Mrs. Bowman
of San Jose have been having a very
pleasant and interesting visit since their
arrival in New York, the 18th inst. '
As manager of the celebrated Golden
Gate Fruit Packing Company Mr. Bow
man's engagements have been such as
to keep him on the constant move
since his arrival in Gotham. Like
all Westerners, he does not believe
in all work and no play, there
fore he and Mrs. Bowman have
have had several pleasant days down at
Old Point- Comfort, and almost every
evening has found them enjoying one of
the theaters or vaudeville performances
during their New York visit.
Mr. and Mrs. Bowman have not decided
at what time they will return to Cali
fornia.
Mrs. Janet Hacdonald, who came on
here several months -ago to lecture on
California scenery and California prod
ucts, will shortly re '.urn to her. home in
San Francisco, where she hopes to regain
her health and strength. Mrs. Macdona'.d
has had more than her share of ill-fortune
since her arrival in New York early in the
winter.
The severe weather combined with a se
rious attack of rheumatism confined her
to her room for many weeks. Sue had no
more than recovered from her- painful
rheumatic siege than she was seized with
an aggravated case of snow- blindness.
Owing to her weakened condition she has
b*?en unable to keep any of her lecture en
gajiÂ« ments, and wisely bus concluded to
return to her home in the land of golden
poppies and orange sunshine.
The other afternoon 1 had the pleasure
of seeing two well-known and prominent
Californians meet unexpectedly, and the
erecting they gave each other was delight
fully refreshing 'to witness. One was J.
B. Randall of "San Francisco, president of
the First National Bank in; San Jose, and
the other was E. S. Sanford, a fruit-grower
and financier of San Jose. '
They had a jolly little talk and they
strolled up Broadway for a few. blocks,
and suffice to say that a very cold bottle
and : the _ necessary adjuncts followed the
happy meeting.

district and is a popular point of depart
ure. Austin Creek with its tributaries is
one of the finest trout sections to be
found in the State, though not so
accessible as others. Cazadero is the
terminus of the : railroad, and the
center of the Austin Creek region. The
mountains begin tb grow in altitude here
and every valley has its stream, which,
flowing from great heights, the waters are
clear and coldâ the ideal home of tbe
trout.
At Cazadero the stages tbat penetrate
into the Gualala River country begin.
This is the finest trout section of all Cali
fornia. The Gualala flows for fifty miles
parallel with the ocean, and from the east
receives a number of streams just filled
with trout. The middle fork of the Gua
lala gathers from a hundred mountain
rivulets and offers splendid sport for those
of adequate physical endurancewhile Buck
eye and Kockpile Creeks are about as
good. â  These streams are rarely fished,
and the trout inhabiting tbem are large
and gamy, but no one ou_ht to penetrate
into this region unless he is prepared to
endure and spend at least a week
without other occupation. There are
any number of little hamlets where
creature comforts can be bad, and at all
the farmhouses a hearty welcome is as
sured to those disposed to reciprocate. To
the visitor the advice is given not to go
into this sparsely settled portion of So
noma without being fully equipped.
A portion of the State that has ever
been a favorite resort of anglers is where
the Russian River has its source, in Men
docino County. It is calculated that in
the river and its tributaries there are over
200 miles of stream tbat simply abound in
trout.
Private enterprise, with a view of en
couraging fisherman traffic, has stocked
these waters with millions of young trout
during the past two years, and reports
are unanimous that more trout are now to
be seen in these streams than ever before.
Hundreds of anglers are preparing for
a jaunt to some of these points, and to-day
will witness crowded trains and merry
passengers. The copious rains of the
past winter have filled many of the trout
streams to the banks, and it is expected
that the early fishing will not be as fruit
ful in big catches as a little later on.

A Marriage
of Eternity
"Ashes to ashesâ ashes to immortality."
These words were spoken, half audibly,
by an aged man who stord on a bridge
looking at the grotesque figures made by
the moonlight on the rippled river a few
feet beneath him. He looked very in
tently at the silvery water with the view
of one expecting to see something. He
was expecting to see something, and his
expectation was one of years. Several
times he had almost persuaded himself
that his hope was to be realized ; as many
times had he been disappointed.
A whirlwind of thought rushed through
his brain. A suggestion came to him un
bidden. It had come to him before and
had been just as often repelled. This
nieht it refused to depart. It demanded
satisfaction and the man could not some
how summon the usual strength to aid
him in shaking off the slavery that he
realized he was enduring.
Should he take the plunge? That only
could satisfy. With an effort that shook
his whole frame he moved from the
bridge, thinking to himself, "Ashes to
ashesâ to perfection to immortality,"
and the voice called back as an echo,
"When yon are again united, yes.'
In his youth that man bad loved. He
had not bestowed bis passion sentiment
tally,* but his nature had found its lacking
element and had entered into a perfect al
liance. From the moment they became
aware what each was to the other they
were a unit one heart, one mind, one
being, a part ot one beautifully harmoni
ous whole. It is not, however, given to
fallen mankind to enjoy on this side of
that accident of existence designated the
grave as much hnppiness as was theirs.
As the year closed death came nnd .he
was taken from him. The world thought
they were separated, but as he looked for
what others considered the last lime on
that beautiful face, cold in death, he real
ized, that, instead of a divorce, be was
more potently. wedded than "ever during
their short united life in the flesh.
-. The old method of sepulture was re
pulsive to himâ unnatural, barbaric The
everlasting doctrine of purification by, fire
was infinitely more acceptable. He felt
just as happy as on his '; wedding day,
when a beautifully chnced, small marble
urn was placed on his mantel, containing
ashes as sacred, to him as his life. Al
ways united in spirit, he viewed the urn
with unalloyed pleasure. Once more they
.would come together, with not the re
motest prospect of parting. From out of
that urn would rise a figure perfect as an
anpcl. 7 Immortality. should clothe those
ashes and an eternal union should be
theirs. .' * '.'--"- â¢--"â¢*â¢
A solitary passenger was on the quarter
deck of a stanch ship as she was buffeted
by o;gaIe r off _, Cape Horn. It was New
Year's eve, but never ' was night, made
brighter, blacker, noisier or grander. The
thunder was too loud to awe; the light
ning too bright ana sudden to daze and the
blackness too often broken. to create fear.
The lonely passenger, protected by the
weather cloth, grasped the taffrail with
his hands and divided his attention be
tween sea and sky. Violent squalls fre
quently forced the Jee rails beneath the
water and the darkest and lowest clouds
appeared to settle almost on the crest of
the waves. The orgies of the descending
hail; the wind making teolian music with
every shroud and rone; the cracking of
every stanchion and plank; . the wild
breaking of the huge waves as they rushed
up to the bulwarks, washed across the
decks and pursued their irresistible career
to leeward; the tearing asunder of the
clouds by the. weird, fantastic, fiery
lightning; the chirping of the little petrels
low on the water and the cawing of the
big sea birds high above the mastsâ all
this was as paradise to the solitary pas
senger. He looked with absolute pity
upon the mate when that officer suggested
that he leave it all and retire to the
warmth of his berth.
A few minutes after making the not al
together unreasonable suggestion the
mate thought he heard the man behind
the weather-cloth speak.
"Did you speak, sir?" But there was
no answer and the mate concluded he had
made a mistakeâ but be had not.
For the first time he realiz d that the
wind was cold and that frost had formed
on bis mustache. Before he had time to
brush it away with his mittencd hand
the turmoil commenced once more and
his mind was again in harmony with it.
Suddenly he saw something in the
clouds;. a flash of lightning hung in the
heavens a. few seconds longer than usual.
He could plainly distinguish an almost
perfect figure advancing toward him over
the white tops of the mighty waves. He
extended one hand to greet itâ or her â
and with the other he attempted to brush
from his eyes the film that he thought
was responsible for bis not seeing clearer.
But it was not a haze; he was not yet
fitted to see perfectly. The unholy thought
again came unbidden that if he were to
take one plunge his yearnin-- would be at
an end. That wicked suggestion robbed
him instantly of the power to see at all,
for he was gazing, not with his eyes, but
with his soul.
The lightning faded away almost as sud
denly as it came. The passenger dropped
both bis bands, muttered a despondent
â¢'Oh I" and laboring beneath an unspeak
able weight of disappointment he sought
the seclusion of his berth. Tne storm be
came irksome to him and he realized that
the ship was tossing violently.
Another New Year's eve an old man sat
in a scantily furnished room. His chair
was drawn to a little table, upon which
his arms rested, they in turn receiving the
weight of his head. On the mantel
piece was the little urn, around which his
whole life had been encircled, and Irom
which it drew its Inspiration. He watched
it intently. Not for an instant did he take
his eyes off it, and never was human gaze
more expectant The concentration of
those dilated orbs on the precious recep
tacle was so intense it was not difficult to
imagine a tangible connection between
them. " , .
It was sundown when he sat oy the
table, but the stars had twinkled many
hours before be felt that his desire was on
the eve of being fulfilled. He was again
young. Half a century had been blotted
out and he again beard the words, "Ashes
to ashes â to immortality."
His eyes raised a little, and ob ! the un
natural light that illuminated them. It
was unearthly, beautiful, the expression
of perfect joy. Over the urn he again
saw those eyes. There was no haze be
fore them; they were as clear as day. As
he watched the form of a face surmounted
them, the same face he bad almost been
peimitted to see so many times during
the past fifty years, marred not by a single
wrinkle, and in whose veins the blood
cased to course exactly as the clock struck
ten, so long ago.
The old man looked up for a brief in
stant. Although the night was dark, for
a small space of time the room was filled
with light. He looked at the mantelpiece,
but the urn was not there. Over the place
where It had been was the almost perfect
figure that had been enshrined so long in
the eye of his mind.
"Ashes to immortality," he gasped, and
his head fell heavily on his hands. Slower
and slower he breathed. The figure
stretched out her hands and approached
him. A sound came from his bended
head. It was that peculiar human ex
pression that expresses perfect content
ment. Just as the breath left the worn
out body it was no longer a vision. The
moment he cast off the shackles of the
world arms of love were extended as
though ready to welcome some one in a
warm embrace and beiore they closed the
room wan dark. Â.Â«_Â£-Â£
Next day a rigid lifeless eld man was
found in a room in a lodging-house, and
twelve wise men recorded a verdict of
â¢'death by the visitation of God."

Discoveries in Electricity
#"*^WOME very remarkable discoveries
have recently been made in the
ârnmwjc field *of electricity. It has been
found possible to ' transmit electrical
energy, or, in other words, to produce
dynamic force at a great distance from the
source of energy without the aid of .wires
! or other conductors.
For many years ingenious men have
striven to accomplish the work of tele
graphing without wires, but without ar
riving at any practical solution of the
problem -until now. The phenomenon of
"induction" that is, the appearance of
an electric current upon a wire strung
parallel to another wire charged with a
currentâ been familiar to electricians
ever since the use of 'wires as conductors,
but no rational answer to the question,
Why? has heretofore been brought for
ward.
Three men, each distinguished in the
scientific worldâ Dr. Jagadis Chunder
Bose, a Hindoo, professor of Physics in
the Presidency College, Calcutta; Gugli
elmo Marconi, an Italian, and Nikola
Tesla, a Montenegrinâ have, each inde
pendently of the other, arrived at similar
results in their studies of electric induc
tion, and each one announces, and proves
hi* claim by experimental demonstration,
that it is quite practical to produce elec
trical phenomena at great distances from
.the exciting cause.
Professor Bose has been able to ring bells
THE NEW LIGHT AT HOME.
A Aâ Exhausted globes. B â Induction plates concealed in tne walls.
I and operate an ordinary telegraphic instru
| ment at a distance of hundreds of feet
from his transmitting instrument, the
force-rays of electrical energy passing
throngh brick and stone walls without im
pediment. His apparatus consists of a
small platinum ball placed between two
platinum beds connected to a battery of
two storage cells, having an electro- motive
force of two volts, and rendering the elec
tric emanations -iven off by the platinum
. ball into a bundle of parallel rays
!by means of a condensing lens made
of sulphur, pitch and ebonite. Marconi's
apparatus is a modified form of the famil
iar Hertz machine for producing static
electricity. Marconi in his experiments
used no condensing lens, and he . appeared
to have achieved better results than has
i Professor Bose. W.H. Preece, the chief
I of the electrical department of the British
postal system, has carefully investigated
Marconi's claims, and says that they are
proven. The electrical waves generated
by Marconi's machine have been sent
two miles through bouses ami hills, and
! can be sent twenty miles with more pow
erful machines than those employed in
the experiments.
Vessels at sea provided with proper re
ceivers may be communicated with, and
the electrical waves possess an energy
that may be applied with terrible effect in
warfare, for they miy be directed against
the powder magazine of a hostile iron
clad to explode its contents should it
happen that a couple of pieces of metal
were in the magazine in position to set up
induction. No little alarm is already
felt among interested naval men as to the
probable effect of this most wonderful
discovery. Nikola Tesla has, as is well
Known, made exhaustive investigation
into the phenomena of high frequency
and high potential currents, and he has
produced before assemblages of the fore
most men in scientific research many
marvelous demonstrations.
All of the investigations and experi
ments made by these thr.e men demon
strate that vibration is the keynote of all
phenomena. Light and heat are convert
ible the one into the other simply by rais
ing or lowering the rate of vibration.
Both aro actual force. Light, which is a
form'"' of heat, is due to ihe agitation, o r
vibration, of electro-statically charged
molecules. "In * the roduction '. of light
waves electro-static effects must be brought
into play.
The "quantity" of electric energy is not
essential, for but feeble luminosity is ob
tainable from the most powerful electro
magnetic induction effects. It is found
that the molecules ot common air are
'thrown into violent agitation when they
are placed within an electro-static field
produced by high potential currents, and
that the removal of a portion of the air
molecules from a closed vessel renders it
easier for the remaining molecules to vi
brate; and. further, that the vibration of
these molecules produces luminosity. *
Being possessed of these facts,- it is easy
to construct an apparatus by which light
may oe obtained at a distance from the
generator of electrical energy without em
ploying conducting wires. A room may
be brilliantly illuminated by placing in
the walls concealed plates connected with
a machine that creates currents of high
frequency and' moat potential and , sus
pending in the center of the room glass
globes from which the air has been partly
exhausted. As soon as the plates are
charged an electro - static field -is
created surrounding the globes.which then
glow with brilliant light. Not only
such a mode novel, it is desirab c from an
economic standpoint, as the necessary
electrical energy is produced at much
less cost tban is that required for the
prosent system of electric lighting; and
besides, as the current used is of very low
amperage, there is less danger of fire,
which must always attend the use o!
poweriul currents on hidden wires.
The new discoveries open up an im
mense field of practical application that
has hitherto been closed. _-. will now be
possible to erect a lighthouse at any pos
sible point of danger on our coasts and
light its lamp by a current sent from th_
shore, regardless of fogs, storms or sea
son. Ships ma/ be communicated with
or themselves hold converse* with the in
accessible shore, and the hostile warship
destroyed long before it can reach avail
able shelling distance.. 'V**7":J~7
Every city in our land is disfigured by
the plexus of unsightly wires which are
necessary for tho operation of the various
applications of electricity used by us. To
place all of these wires, underground
would be desirab.e, but it is practically
impossible. * As th. demand for tele
phonic and light -ervico i ncreases addi
tional wires are required, and no Dusiness
man would, engage in an enterprise re
quiring un outlay that was not reasonably
assured of return.
A street ones provided with eood road
way may not b3 broken up every lime

My bare feet pass through the drooping grass,
which, pining, sickens and longs for
dew. j
Through the shadowy lines of the dim, aark
pines and . the . trailing branches of
somber yew
A whisper passes, as though they knew I had
entered night's secret place.
Through the dusky sheaves and the chestnut
leaves the murmur quickens and grows
; ..apace;
And the first bird wakes in the ash-tree copse
And, note by note, its music drops
Down from the height of their slender tops
Ero the veil has fallen from my face.
In sleep's dim bowers the dazzled hours fo'd
..**7 T .\ their pinions before their eyes
As they see my light on the edge of night
slowly flit through the eastern skies:
The world grows wan and the low. winds rise,
' and the sailor sees my star,
While the Pleiads fail and the heavy Whale
shrinks and lessens and dies afar;
And the treacherous searocks looming stand
Like great gray ghosts on the rim of sand
Uy the lonely Islet, far from land,
Across the surf-struwn bar.
On the high, steep world the dreaming fold stir
in their slumber ere I am gone;
The faint bell shakes and the shepherd wakes
and stares at the shadows my wings have
thrown; ;.\
The broad light spreads on the heathery down
and the flowers unclose as I pass;
In the dark, still woods the. lime tree buds
scatter their sweets on the nestling grass;
And starry bl ssoms that all night steep
Their delicate petals in odorous sleep
Are waked with a touch as: my white robes
sweep â  '-.:.'
Through the purple petunias.
On the twilight way 'twixt -light and day my
spirit lingers, bul may not wail;
The drifting cloud is my pearly shroud under
â¢â *. .-. 7 ; -. he porch of the western gate.
My course is swifter than Love or Fate, it is
brief as man's desire;
With wings unfurled I drop from the world as
an eagle sinks to he.- mountain eyre:
But the breath of my being on land and sea
Binds earth an.l heaven, and ere I fle-
I kindle the torch of the day to be,
And the east breaks forth in fire.

WHICH 'URKD HIM AFTER EVERT-

Painful diseases arc bad enough, but when a
roan is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
â uch a strain men are scarcely responsible for
i what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tosued on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
I his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid lv the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but â¢ enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to _end\his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are- thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at enca could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I' can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mall the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a few things on ear
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time of happiness to most of us. Write to

NEW YORK. N. V., April 3. -The market for

the trading was on a small ale. The total trans

to unusually narrow limits. There was a little
pressure to sell Jersey Central -ani leather pre

tinued to be adversely. influenced by I lie poor con

the session attempts were made by the. smaller
shorts to cover contracts. 'This Imparted a firmer

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111-, April 3. â A better feeling made
Itself apparent in the wheat market this morning-
Opening price- were half a cant higher than yes
terday's closing.' "Calls" bad the advance In
check, ana this strength was not great enough to
â factually destroy that barrier. Liverpool by
quoting Id advance was primarily responsible for
the bulge, but buying encouragement was also
derived from Ugh er receipts In tne North 1,
.56 crtrs, against 447 last Saturday and 447 a
year ago. Exports from both coasts for the wesfc
were rather better than they have been recently,
2,605,0 J0 bushels going out. Receipts at Chicago
were nine cars. Export clearances were light at
177.323 bushels.- Prices broke after the first hour
on the Modern Miller's estimate of a crop of 334,
--000,000 bushels. Tbe close was tame. May
wheat opene.l from 7 . **4c to 71 Vfcc, sold between
71% c and 70S/ B e, closing at 70**4.c to 70*/ 3 c, V*s<*

1108,4 c. closing at Btf% io 89i;_c.
CuÃNâ The corn market was of particular In
terest to speculators. The early strength of wheat
naturally Induced shorts to cover, and It bein<
the last day of the week there was som) liquida
tion on both sides of tbe market. The close was
easier, in sympathy with wheat. May corn opened
at 24*Â»4<t24y 8 c sold between 24"- 8 c and 24"i B e,

It is an extraordinary instance of the
irony of fate that Lord Robert's son should
lose the sight of one eye at polo. For

considerable a's to give the game a bad
name among ti.e authorities.

tending the scope and influence of the work
of tne National League for Good Rods by lur
ther perfecting the organization ol that league,
do report to the National officers of said league
at Washington, D. C, as follows:
Alter a consideration of the state of public
opinion on questions of road and street im
provement, of the condition of the agitation
for good roads organizations throughout all
sections of the United States, of the United
States Government work for good roads now
conducted by General Roy Stone through the
Department of Agriculture, of the work being
dove throughout the United States by tbe
National League of Good Ronds (a league

a branch of the United States Department
of Agriculture, from its already large volun
teer membership in all sections of tne United
States, is an organization which can b; in
creased to a membership of several hundred
thousand persons, resulting in vast benefit to
the whole country through the dissemination
of good roads literatuie, aiding in the forma
tion of local organizations ior constructing and
maintaining good roads everywhere and for
procuring local legislation in furtherance of
this object.
Secondâ That this work for good roads will
beof special value to the State of California
and the entire Pacific Coast, as wen as to
various Interests on the Atlantic Coast and in

To this end we recommend that the advo
cates and believers in good roads in all states
of the Union use their efforts toward securing
State organizations to co-operate with the
National League lor Good Roads, and to call
State good roads conventions in every State
lor the purpose of discussing local road ques

SHOT IN THE BACK.
"William Godfrey, an Old Sailor, Mis-
taken for a Burglar by
Henry Dabel.
William Godfrey, an old sailor on the
Independence, was mistaken for a burglar
early yesterday morning and bad a nar
row escape from being killed.
He arrived in the City from Mare
Island Friday morning and started in to
have a good lime. He finished up' in
Michael O'Toole's saloon, 911 Folsom
-street, and was so drunk that O'Toole
allowed him to sleep in a rear room.
Shortly after 4 o'clock Godlrey went out
side ana got onto the porch of 909 a. The
occupant was awakened by the noise and
she notified Henry Dabel, a teamster liv
ing at 909b, that a burglar was trying to
break into hei- house.
Dabel grabbed his revolver and made
bis way to the porch of his bouse. He
yelled, "Who is there?" and, not receiv
ing an answer, he fired .wo shots at the
figure on the other porch.
"What are you firing at me for?" yelled
Godfrey, and Dabel rushed downstairs to
intercept him if he attempted to escape.
A young man living at 909 a rushed out
side and blew a police whistle and Police
men Eskew and Nolting responded.
They found Godfrey stretched out on
the porch, groaning. He said he bad
been shot. The ambulance was sum
moned and he was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Dr. Fitzgibbon found
that a bullet bad entered his back and
lodged, above the liver. It has not yet
been extracted.
Dabel was arrested by Eskew and Nolt
ing and booked on the charge of assault
to murder. The case was called in Judge
Low's court yesterday and continued till
Tuesday. He was released on $.000 bonds.

OUR NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
The Next Grand Parlor Will
Meet at Sonora in "Old
Tuolumne."
A Solid Go d Key and the Freedom of
the P. ace Will Be Presente.
to the Grand President.
At no time since Miss Lilly O. Reichling
founded the order in this State have the
Daughters of the Golden West taken so
much interest in a Grand Parlor session
as they are at this time, taking in the one
that is to be held next June in the town of
Sonora, Tuolumne County, whicn is the
home of Mrs. Belle- Wingfield Conrad,
grand vice- president, and who at the com
ing session will become the grand presi
dent of the order.
It was through her efforts principally
that Sonora was selected as the meeting
place for the next Grand Parlor, although
she was ably assisted in her efforts by the
members of Dardaoelle Parlor No. 66, of
wbich she is past president, and members
of Tuolumne Parlor No. 144 of the Native
Sons of tbe Golden West.
That the people of Tuolumne County â
"Old Tuolumne," as it is generally
known appreciate the honor that has
been -conferred upon it â that of having in
its metropolis tbe assemblage of the most
inteliignt, brilliant, and many of the most
beautiful daughters ot the Golden State,
is apparent from the tact that the citizens
have contributed nuggets of the aggregate
value of $200, which a local jeweler is at
this time manufacturing into a solid gold
key. This, when the ladies are welcomed
to the place by the Board of Trustees of
Sonora, Mrs. Mary Â£. Tillman, the grand
president, will receive from the presi
dent of the board, together with the free
dom of the metropolis for herself and the
members of the Grand Parlor.
The first contribution for this present,
which will represent tbe chief product of
the county, was made by Thomas Dono
hoe of Don Pedro, who stated that if tbe
grand president was to be presented with
a key to Sonora it should be a gold one,
not an imitation one, ior old Tuolumne
abhors imitations.
The members of the two parlors named
and the citizens of .Sonora are at this time
actively engaged in making arrangements
on a grand scale for the entertainment of
the grand officers and delegates ' during
their stay in the place. The committees
have already been appointed; the fol
lowing named being chosen as tne general
and finance commitee: Mr.. M. J. Hamp
ton, Mrs. L Van ilnr.in H. T. Shine,
Mrs. N. A. Bother, Mrs. A. McCreaney,
Mrs. S. Sherourne, Miss H. M. Morris,
Miss I. Q. Hall, Miss M. F. Leonard, Miss
M. Riordan. Aides 'to the - committee:
Messrs. D. M. Ortega. R. I. Bromley, J.
Curtin, J. A. Van Harlingen, E. L. Rehm,
H. Harivig, C. G. Bacon, J. Johnson, H.
McCain bridge, J. Durkin, T. Pierce and C.
C. Ortega.
Mrs. N. A. Rotber, the popular presi
dent of Dtrdenelle Parlor, was chosen'
president of the committee,' Miss Irene G.
Hall, who is secretary of the parlor, was
chosen to be secretary of the committee,
and Mrs. M. J. Wells, who is district dep
uty for Calaveras and Tuolumne counties,
which includes Ruby Parlor of Murphys,
Dardanelle Parlor of Sonora and Princess
Parlor of Angels, was . chosen . treasurer. ,
It will be the, work of this committee, to
direct all arrangements and lay out a pro
gramme tbat will be attended to as to de
tails by the several sub-committees.
â¢ Reports from the ;; various parlors
throughout the State are to the effect that
there is a general movement to increase
the membership for the purpose of having
a larger, representation, in the Grand Par
lor. The prospective grand president,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 4, 1897.
who, by the way, holds the second office
in the Kui.hts and Ladies of Honor, that
of .rand vice-protector, recently said: "I
cannot tell how many will visit Sonora
durin_tbe session of the. Grand Parlor,
but the indications are that we will have
a larger attendance tban there has ever
been at any of our Grand Parlors. There
will also be a great number of visitors,
not only from the immediate vicinity, but
from remote parts of the State."
SLIM THANKSGIVING.
One Cause of Complaint Made by Mrs.
Trumpour Against Her Huoband.
"I feel great doubt in this matter, as in all
divorce cases that come before me, touch
ing the matter of alimony, but pendente
lite I shall order Dr. Trumr-our to pay $50
a month as alimony," said Judge B:lcher
wearily, in disposing of the suit of Mrs.
Marian A. Trumpour against Dentist J.
P. Trumpour, whose marital troubles
have recently afforded considerable cause
for comment in the public press.
Attorneys Lennon and Hawkins, repre
senting Mrs. Trumpour, at once offered to
supply any information that the court
might desire in order to show that Dr.
Trumpour is enjoying a fine practice;
that his patients are among the 400 and
that bis income is not less than $300 a
month. IrAj-yilMflSÃfeflCTH
"That would be all right so far as it
goes," replied the court, "but, you see,
Mr. Frank, who represents Dr. Trumpour,
bas witnesses who strongly combat that
The accusations of cruelty were vehe
mently denied by Dr. Trumpour, but his
wife insisted tbat be had been very cruel,
and as an instance cited his action on last
Thanksgiving day, when she said he
knew there was nothing in the house for
his family to eat. She sent her son tQ ask
him for something for the Thanksgiving
repast for herself and her tbree children,
and he sent back 10 cents in money, half
a pound of tea, half a pound of coffee and
half a roll of butter. She said tbat thir
caused her great mortification and mental
distress. She further averred that be
called her "a snake in the grass," and was
cruel to her in other ways.
Judge Belcher took under consideration
the proper disposition of the minor chil
dren and the final order in regard to the
proper amount to be paid for Mrs. Trutn
pour's maintenance. He asked the law
years to make a definite calculation in re
gard to Dr. Trumpour's income, saying
that pending the signing of a decree cf
divorce the lady would be entitlod to re
ceive $50 a month, payable weekly.

MBS. HUDSON'S LIBERT Y.
Judge Dunne Kuie* That It Hat Not!
Been Impaired.
Judge Dunne yesterday dismissed the
habeas corpus proceedings in the case of
Mrs. Ada M. Hudson, wife of ex- Judge
Hudson, formerly of Lake County.
The petition for the writ was presented
by Fred Elliott, a son of Mrs. Hudson by
a former marriage, who swore that his
mother was restrained of her liberty by
bis stepfather, and -that she was not
I allowed to see or converse with any of her
frif-nds.
Judge Dunne held a session of court at
the lady's residence for ] the purpose of
bearing testimony,' because she .was not
physically able to appear at the City
Hall.
It was acertained that Mrs. Hudson has
been in feeble health for some time and
that her husband. objects to the admission
of his stepson and some other visitors to
her bedside, but it did not appear that
she was illegally deprived of her liberty, v
â¢ The court ruled that habeas, corpus is
not the proper remedy for tha correction
of : any wrong that may exist in this case,
so the writ was discharged.

NYE DEFENDS MORMONS.
The Local Elder Replies to the
Criticisms of the Rev.
Mr Day.
Contends That California Owes Much
to His C-Relig onislsâ Articles
of Faith.
Elder E. H. Nye of the local Mormon
church has issued a reply to the recent
criticisms of the Rev. Mr. Day, in the
course of which he observes:
"There are two sides to every question.
To judge the Mormons by the 'They say
so' of enemies is manifestly unjust. 'By
their fruits ye shall know them,' the
Savior said, and we are willing to be
judged by this divine method of ascer
tainment. No one can examine with an
unprejudiced mind the mythical stories
in comparison with the historical facts â
connected with this people without con
cluding (hat the Mormons have been mis
represented and outrageously defamed. A
pet theme employed by those who antag
onize our faith is to rehash some hearsay
story tending to prove that some Utonian,
who is suspected of being a Mormon, has
not been morally perfect, and they, reason
from this that of course Mormonism must
be a fallacy, as though the divine truths
of heaven depended on the actions of any
individuals for their validity. We con
sider these poor weapons.
"Our reverend friend complimented the
people of California because the Latter
Day Saints oid not settle here as (he said),
they intended to do, thus josin_ sight. of
the fact that tbey were tne first American
immigrants that, settled in California;
that they were the first that tilled the soil
of this fair State; that they started the
first newspaper here; tbat, while in the
employ of John Marshall, they were the
first to discover the gold, and that in the
Kearney-Fremont case tne' Mormon bat
talion played a very important part in
estaDlisbing the United States Govern
ment on the Pacific Coast.' We mention
these facts to .how that it was not the
intention of our people to settle here, but
in tbe valleys of Utah, and to further
show that no connections that our people
have had with California have made her
less glorious."
Mr. Nyo quotes the report of Governor
West and the testimony of the Governors
of Idaho and Arizona, and of Bishop
Spalding, in which triouta i* paid to tiie
admirable qualities of tbe Mormons; and
cites Scripture in substantiation of the
Mormon doctrine that . God is a personal
being. He concludes:
"We are charged with having a creed
that is calculated in its nature to deceive;
that it is fascinating,, but unholy. '*â¢ In
order that the people may judge, we sub
mit to you our articles of faith unaltered,
as arrange. by Joseph Smith : and as be
lieved in and practiced by the Latter-day
Saints throughout their entire history.
Judge them by the law and testimony.
We are not seeking sympathy,' but equal
privileges with our fellow-men to defend
the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus
Christ." :BBHnB-HÂ£nnnfl9Mt|U

of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

Many a nervous woman ; sits up all the
night and tries to read herself sleepy. Nine
to one 6he don't accomplish her purpose. .
Nine to one, she gets more and more ner-
vous. The slightest sound strikes terror to
her heart. The dark corners of the room
contain a thousand frights. 1 She doesn't
know what she is afraid of, but she is afraid,
actually, honestly, nervously, abjectly afraid.
Healthy women are not cowards. If a wo-
man is nervous and sleepless and afraid of
the rustle of her own dress, there is some-
thing the matter with her. The most deli-
cate nerves in her, body are set on edge by
weakness or disease. Nine-tenths of the
nervousness, irritability and bad temper in
women is merely a symptom of ill health-
ill health of the delicate and sensitive or-
ganism that makes her a woman. If she ir
overworked, or worried, the effect will
show itself there first. There is no use tak
ing harmful and deadly narcotics for ncr
vousness and sleeplessness.: It will leave

before.* .The way to effect a cure is to cure
the cause. Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
