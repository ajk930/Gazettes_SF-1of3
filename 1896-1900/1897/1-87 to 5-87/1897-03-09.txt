DEFIANCE AT

Morehouse Takes the Lead
in Denouncing Hearst's
Scavenger Sheet.
DEBAUCHES ALL TRUE MANHOOD
Legislators Besmirched by the Circulators of
k Filth Temporarily Postpone the Pun
ishment of the Recalcitrant
Witnesses.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March B.â lt was not by any clever bit of
finesse, but by simply an ordinary trick of the legal practitioners in the
police courts that Andrew M.' Lawrence, managing fake editor of
Hearst's fake journal of San Francisco, and his unfortunate subordin
ates were not tried before the bar of the Senate to-day.
At the last moment a telegram was presented from George A.
Knight begging for a postponement until to-morrow on the ground that
business kept him in San Francisco. And this trivial excuse was put
forward after every consideration in the matter of time had been
accorded by the Senate bribery investigation committee on last Friday.
This play of the Examiner for time is well understood among the
members, but in their determination to do nothing that might even savor
r persecution, the plea for postponement was granted.
One of the most striking features of the proceedings in connection
with the fake article of the Examiner and its complete exposure was
t buke administered publicly and spontaneously to the fake "new
journalism" as exemplified by the San Francisco Examiner during the
morning session of the Senate.
Wht-n ifie reading of the report of the committee, reciting the facts
of the witnesses' contempt, was concluded, there was loud hand-clap
ping. When the resolution citing Long Green Lawrence and Al Mur
phy and L. L. Levings, his unfortunate subordinates, to appear before
the bar of the Senate to answer for their recalcitrancy was read there
was more applause. When Senator Morehouse spoke for his honor and
the honor of the body of which he is a member, and hurled defiance at
iho ir.aibm.vt rake journal the applause was more hearty and pro
longed, and when the resolution was 1 adopted all thought of decorum
was loit and the applause was vociferous.
All three of the witnesses were present, as were two of their at
torneys, Garret McEnerney and Andrew J. Clunie. The latter, with
all their personal, professional and political influence, failed to prevent
the adoption of the resolution mentioned, and even the services of Sam
Rainey were enlisted in the campaign. But all that could be done w^as
to induce the Democratic members present, with the exception of Chap
man, to vote against the resolution, and a few Republicans.
During the evening session, when it was expected the witnesses
v. ore to be tried and, if found guilty, sentenced, the Senate had the
appearance of a first night at the opera. Ladies were present in large
numbers, and the Assembly, had the roll been called there, would have
had to suspend business for lack of a quorum.
It is now understood that the punishment to be imposed will be
imprisonment. Had the sentence been pronounced to-night the prisoners
would have been immediately released, as a writ of habeas corpus is
r< udy to be signed, whenever the occasion arises for it being called into
requisition. |

Not a single member who spoke hesitated
to declare on the floor of the Senate that

This is the resolution introduced by the
committee through Senator Morehouse:
Whereas, There appeared in the San Fran
cisco Daily Examiner of February 27, 1597,
an article headed â¢â¢Bribery In Aid of Thiev

Senators who voted in favor of Assembly bill
273 had received bribes ranging in amounts
from $350 to $500 io cast their votes for said
Assembly bill 273; and whereas, thereafter

AUTONOMY IS NOT THE REMEDY
To the Combined Friends of Turkey the
People of the Hellenes Declare That
Christians on the Island Must
Be Protected*
LONDON, Exg., March B.â The Chroni
cle to-morrow will publish a dispatch
from Athens giving the full text of the
reply ot Greece to the powers. After a
brief preamble the reply continues:
"In view of the extraordinary gravity of
the results which will follow, his Majesty's
Government considers it to be its duty to
submit to the powers its opinion of the
measures decided upon, an opinion wnich
is the result of Jong experience and ac
quaintance with the situation in Crete.
"Impressed by the sentiments which
animate the powers and their solicitude
for general peace, the Greek Government
will not fail in this duty, since Greece also
ardently desires to contribute to the main
tenance of peace and to save from utter
ruin the population of an island put to
severe trial and so often decimated.
"We believe that the new regime of au
tonomy adopted by the powers unhappily
cannot correspond to the noble intentions
that inspire it, and that it will surfer the
fate of the different administrative sys
tems which at vnriou3 times and without
success have been tried in Crete.
"This is not the 'first time that Crete
finds herself in a state of insurrection- In
recent times on more than six occasions â¢
the horrors of anarchy have shaken and
imperiled ? her uxi.-itcticu. "II tha : * n tap
regime with whicb it is proposed to endow
her is not calculated to re-establish 'j order
iii a definitive manner the Greek Govern
ment cannot double the impossibility of
putting an end by means of . it to the pres
ent state of revolution. Anarchy will
continue to ravage the country with tire
and sword-in its hands and blind fanati
cism will continue its destructive work of
exterminating a people which assuredly
does not deserve such a fate.
"Before such a prospect our responsi
bility would be enormous if we did not
most earnestly urjje the powers not to in
sist upon the scheme of autonomy pro
posed, but rather to restore to Crete what
she already had at the time of the en
franchisemant of other provinces which
form the kingdom of Greece and to lead
her back to Greece, to which she belonged
since Capriodistis was President.
"In the presence of the recent massacre,
pillage and conflagration in Canea, in ihe
presence of the frightful anguish to which
the inhabitant of Crete have been ex
posed and menaced by the boundless fury
of the Mussulman population, who-pre
vented the departure of Christian families
for Greece, which has always been a provi
dential refuse for all these miserable
beings, our whole country was torn with
remorse for the responsibility it assumed
last year in inducing the Cretans to lay
down their arms. The misfortunes that
resulted forbid us to undertake once more
such a task, and if we had attempted it
our voice would certainly have been fee
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ble. Its echo would not hava reached tba
Cretan people.
"It being the case, therefore, that a new
regime of autonomy could not fulfill tho
noble aims of the powers, it is obvious
what would be the situation ot the un
happy island until the establishment ol
this regime.
"If the powers deem it their duty to
persevere in their resolutions with tho
above views and in the name of humanity
as well as in the interest of the island,
the pacification of which is the un.que
object of the solicitude of the powers, we
do not hesitate to appeal to them oq the
subjects of the other measures â namely,
tho recall of our military forces. Indeed,
if because of the presence of the united
squadrons in Cretan waters and in the
conviction that the squadrons will not
permit Turkish troops to embÃrk on tho
island, the presence also of all the ships
of the Greek fleet off Crete is judged to be
necessary, the presence of the Greek army
on the island, nevertheless, is shewn to
be desirable alike iroin sentiments of
humanity and in the interests of the
definite re-establishment of order. Our
duty sDecia'.ly forbids us to abandon the
Cretan people to the mercy of Mussulman
fanaticism and the Turkish army, which
at all times has deliberately and intend
feti'y participated ia the aggressive scm
of the populace.
"Above all, if our troop* on the island,
who are worthy of the confidence of th-i
j powers, have received a mandate to paciiy
| the country, their desires and intentions
| would have received prompty the most
j perfect satisfaction. It would be, then,
I af!er the re-efctablishii ent of order that it
I would be possible to iearn the desires
j free.y expressed of the Cretan people for
I a decision as to t.ieir fate.
"The sorrows which have recurred reg
ularly in Crete for many decades past not
only do not occur without profoundly
agitating the Hellenic people, but they
interrupt social activity and gravely dis
turb the economy and finances of the
state. Even if we admit that it would be
possible to forget for an instant that we
share the common religion of Crete, that
we are of the same race ajnd bound by ties
of blood, we couid not in silence allow the
powers to assume that the Greek state is
able any longer to resist such shocks.
For this reason wo appeal 10 the generous
sentiments animating the powers and beg
them to permit the Cretan people them
selves to declare how they desire to be
governed. SKorzES."
The Chronicle adds, on high authority,
that the Greek Envoys abroad nave been
instructed on receipt of the reply to in
form the Government to wbich they are
accredited that Greece is prepared to rec

Sultan, to withdraw its fleet completely

Lord Salisbury went this afternoon to
Windsor Castle, where he conferred for
Eome time with the Queen. The subject
of the conference has not been made pub
lic, but it is supposed it had some bearing
on the Cretan question.
According to announcements previously
made, the Queen is to start for the Riviera
on Wednesday, and the Prime Minister
would undoubtedly have visited; her
Majesty under any circumstances prior to
her departure. It is announced here this
evening tiiat the French, German and
Russian Ministers bave approved the car
rying out of the threat contained in the
identical note of the powers to blockade
the coasts of Greece in the event of her re
fusing to accede to the demand that she
â¢withdraw her troops from Crete and her
fleet from Cretan waters. Their reason is
that although the reply of Greece gives
some hope of a compromise, it does not
comply with the demand made by the
powers.
The Times to-morrow will publish a dis
patch lrom Canea saying that a torpedo
boat which has arr.ved in Suda Bay from
Selino reports that the negotiations of
Sir Alfred Diliotti with the insurgents at
Se!ino in bebali of the besieged Mussul
mans have failed. Ttie 500 men from the
Tanous v;arshn s which accompanied Sir
Allred will march inland.

coercing Greece. As yet Austria, Ger
many and Russia are the only three of the
six great powers tnat have assented to the
proposals made by the foreien admirals
in Cretan waters, which imply a severe
blockade of the coasts of Greece. The cor
respondent adds thai the- vessels of the
Greel: licet which are in Voli harbor are
kept under strict surveillance.
PARIS, France, March 8 âIn the Cham
ber of Deputies to-day M. Hanotaux, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, requested that the
offering of interpellations upon the subject
of the reply of Greece to the ultimatum of
the powers be postponed, as the reply had
not yet been received. Ex-Minisrer Go
blet requested the Government to consult
the Chamber before taking any active
steps in regard to Greece.
Prime Minister Meline and M. Han^
taux both declared that it was impossible
to speak on the subject before Greece's re
ply and her intentions were officially
known, but they added there would be no
military operations by France without
tbe assent of the Chamber. M. Milleraud,
a eocialist member, asked that to-morrow
be fixed for debating the question.
Prime Minister Meline refused to fix the

CANEA, Crete. March B.â Admiral
Canerve, commander of the Italian fleet

V.ce-Consul, that he must leave the island.
M. Barakiis was recently instructed by
King George to co to Selino to intervene
with the insurgents there in behalf of
the bpsieged Mussulmans of Kandamos.
The Vice-Consul insisted upon going in
the Greek warship Hydra, but this the
foreign admirals would not permit. They
offered to place a Russian torpedo boat at
his service, but'M. Baraklis declined to
accept the offer. It is supposed that his
banishment is due to this refusal.
The foreign admirals have telegraphed
to their respective Governments that they
will immediately dispatch 600 men to
maintain order in the various towns.
It is reported from a Turkish source
that the Mu-sulmans at Kandaraos and
in the province of Selino have started for
Paiikora, where they will be out of danger.
It is expected that they will arrive at
Paiikora this evening. The steamers will
will be dispatched to fetch their belong

EXCESSES IN THE
APPROPRIATIONS
Cannon Compares the Acts
of the Last Two Con
gresses.
Sayers o' Texas Also Makes
Some Rather Pointed
Comments.
Enormous Sums Set Aside for Pubic
Wcrks That Are Declared
Useless.
WASHINGTON, D. <-Â March 8.-The
Congressional Record to-morrow will con
tain a statement made by the Chairman of
the House Committee on Appropriations,
Joseph Cartinon of Illinois, relative to the
appropriations made by the Fifty-fourth
Congress. Cannon says in part as follows:
The total appropriations of tbe two sessions
of this Congress aggregate $1,043,437,01S 53.
Tbe appropriations of the FUty-third Congress,
which was Democratic la both branches, with
a Democratic Executive, amounted, according
the official tables, to $989,239,205 69. To this
sum, however, should be added $4,400,000 on j
account of interest and sinking fund charges
for bonds issued by the Democratic adminis
tration which were not included in the esti
mates of permanent appropriations submitted
to Congress and stated in the tables, which
brings the a urn total of appropriations for all
objects by the Fifty-third Congress up to
$993,639,205 69 of $49.797, 812 84 less than
tue appropriations, including the deficiencies,
made by the present Congress.
Jn explanation of this apparent excess of
appropriations by the Fitty-fourth Congress
over those of the Fifty-third Congress, it should
be slated that the Fifty-third Congress made
increases on account of fortifications in the
sum of $2 i 563,460; on account of river and
hari.ior works, including contracts therefor, in
the sum of $12,470,506; on account of the con
struction of the public buildings, noneof which
were authorized by the F;fty-fourth Coneress,
in the sum of $2,432,500; for '.he postal ser
vice, tn the sum oi $11,454,305: for naval es
tablishment, in the sum ot $8,947,232; on ac
count ot permanent appropriations, mainly. to
meet the interest and sink ing- fund charges |
for the bonds issued by the administration just
leaving power, $24,983,744, or a total of $62,
--763.939.
Cannon admits that appropriations ex
ceeded the estimated demands of the
public service, but this result;, he says,
from conditions growing out of the rules
of the House, the so-called courtesy ot the
Senate and the excessive estimates sub
mitted to Congress. The record shows I
that in no instance during many years
past have the appropriations made by
Congress measured up to the full amounts I
recommended and asked for by the ad
ministration. Cannon condemns the
practice of the Senate in recent years in
amending appropriation bills, notably the
general deficiency, bill by incorporating
provisions to pay claims of every kind
and character outstanding against the
Government â claims that have no status
in many cases other iban perfunctory re
ports from committees, mere tindiuss of
tbe Court of Claims and recommendations
and requests fronj officials of the Govern
ment. The remedy for this evil, he says,
is^ the establishment of a division of the
National jurisdiction, whither these
claims may be sent for full and intelligent
consideration. He joins Dockery in con
demning the present arrangement of di
viding the appropriation bills among a
number of committees.
Sayers of Texas, another member of the
Committee on Appropriations, will also
maKe public, under a leave to print, his
views respecting the appropriations for
the Fifty -fourth Congress He says:
1 believe in the continuing contract system
as applied to the river and harbor improve
ments and other necessary works, but not to
tbe extent which it has been entered upon by
this Congress. In the river and harbor act
passed at the last session under suspension of
th 3 rules, without the opportunity of dis
cussion or amendment, tniny-seven works
were authorized to be placed under contracts
involving a total expenditure of $59,616,
--403 91. After critical examination oi inese
contract authorizations by the Committee on
Appropriations et this session it was devel
oped that one of these r.-orka authorized to be
prosecuted under contract for $1,000,000 was
so abso.utely destitute of merit that tho War
Department bad reiused to take any steps
whatever looking toward the prosecution oi
the work.
In another case authority was given to enter j
into contract for an important work on the
Atlantic coast to the extent of more than
$4,500,000, for whose prosecution a proposal
iia>. bjeu made ana accepted, involving loss
than one-nail that sum. As to three other
Important works, the estimated cost of wjiich
authority to enter into contracts lor their com
pletion were based upon erroneous and insuffi
cient estimates by about 33 per cent in each
case. These iilusi rations prove that the prac
tice of authorizing contracts for public works
should not only be carefully considered iv the
light of the conditiou of the treasury but only
after the fullest investigation as to the real
merits of and the necessity for the appro
priations contemplated, and* only after the
DOS', carefully preparod and absolutely ac
curate estimates of probable cost.
One of the causes for the enormous growth
in appropriations of late yeura has been the
increase of our navy. Since that work was in
augurated in 1883 seventy-seven ships of all
Classes have been constructed or authorized
to be constructed at a cost of more than $130,
--000.000. Already the number ol ships author
ized would require twice the number of au
thorized oflicers and men to keep them all in
commission. The cost of their daily mainte
nance alone is a severe draft upon our dimin
ished revenues. Some of the most imposing
of these ships are already classed by naval ex
perts as obsolete. The appropriation made
for the support ot the Federal Government has
grown to such startling proportions within
the last dozen years as to render it well nigh
impossible to devise means of raising reve
nues wherewith to meet the expenditures. If
the new administration carries out its pledges
by giving to the country a protective tariff it
will utterly fail to produce the means of meet
ing expenditures if it has to be maintained
upon tbe existing high plane, unless perad
vvniure the protective tariff mar be supple
mented with a tax on coffee and tea and per
haps other taxes oi an equally onerous nature.

days of both branches of the Legislature.
In my opinion, after we have pursued this
inquiry to a conclusion, and after we have

found that we end where we commenced.
I know and am satisfied that such an in

there is no substantial basis for the article.
I am in favor of leaving the whole matter

Senator Morehouse made tbe most bril
liant, eloquent and impressive Â«peech of
tbe session, in advocating the resolution.
His burning words made members and
spectators alike forget decorum and dig
nity, and he was frequently made to
pause by the plaudits that his impas
sioned language called forth. He spoke
as follows:

speech. I simply call the attention of the
Senate to this fact â that we are not under
taking to prosecute any newspaper; we
have got no charges against any paper
whatever. But a paper has brought
charges against the Senate, and when we
bring the persons before an investigat
ing committee supposing them to have
knowledge of the facts they allege, they sit
back and say: 'We decline to answer; we
charged you with being bribe-takers; we
said in unmistakable language, beyond a
shadow of doubt that members were
bribed, but we decline to answer.'
"If that be true these men had the facts
in their possession when the article was
written. If they intend to be fair they
would come before this investigation com
mittee and say: 'Gentlemen, here are the
| facts on which we wrote this article.' I
| leave it to any fair-minded man if there is
any other course to pursue.
"Upon the pitiful plea that iti so doing
he would be betraying the confidence re
posed in him as a reporter â one of the
Examiner staff refuses to give such infor
mation â though be forgets the honor that
every man ought to possess, the dignity
that belongs to every respectable man,
and which should require that before he
shall charge and detame ami blacken
other men he should have a fact on which
to base his article.
"I submit that this charge is against
the whole Senate; that the entire State is
askiiiL; us whether we are bribe-takers and
political scoundrels, or whether we are
honest men. And 1 do say tnat we ought
to invite these honest men, the reporters,
who have learned in confidence and have
in their bosoms all this knowledge, here
that they may unbosom themselves. Look
for a moment at the manhood and hon
esty of the penny-a-liner of a public nows
paper, who will charge the members of the
Legislature with bribery ana then hide
himself behind tbe excuse that he owes
something to Mr. Hearst.
" I see no other course but to ask and
demand at the hands of this Senate an
investigation as to my personal conduct.
j I know that I am innocent, but I want the
world to know that 1 am honest. When
they make such charges against me I
know their statements are malignant
falsehoods. But Ido not believe it is right
to have it go out that the Senators of the
thirty-second session of the Legislature
are a pack of infamous scoundrels, who
accepted bribes of $uSO and $500.
"Do you intend to rest under that sus
j picion? Are you afraid of a public news
â  paper because it can indiie and spread all
over the State lines of infamy and slander
against you? Not at all. Let me say tiiat
i Ixmesty will fear nothing, that innocence
can never be frightened, and thai the
truth, if we investigate it, will rise to the
surface. It has been suggested that we
refer the matter to the Grand Jury. We
are a grand jury. We represent one-third
of one of the gieat departments of the gov
ernment of tins State. We have the power
to punish these witnesses for their con
duct. They have sat before us and told
vÂ«, 'We have the facts you want; we had
evidence in the shape of documents; we
destroyed the documents and we decline
to give you the information that was in
those documents.'
"Thank God I stand to-day lite Brutus,
and can nay to this journal. 'Your threats
pass by me like the idle wind.' This Ido
know: I do stand charged by this journal.
There is an inference. They have not sai-1
that Morenouse took $350. 1 wish they
would say it.
"The next day they hinted in the edi
torial columns that perhaps Morehouse
was not guilty. I ask you in defense of
your personal honor to pass the resolu
tion; I ask these men to purge them
selves of contempt. Is it wrong to ask
the?e men, 'If you have any telegrams
that any Senator sent or received in refer
ence to tnese bribery charges tell us about
them; if you know anything about me
tell it to the committee?' It would be to
tbe honor of the San lrancico Examiner
to expose any man who tius been guilty
of taking or paying bribes. If they can
so expose me let them do so. Then let the
committee turn me over to the Grand
Jury to convict me as I ought to be.
''AH that we have done is to invite his
majesty to tell us what he knows about
the charges that he caused to be published
about the 120 members of this Legislature.
But instead of doing this he takes his pen
in his hand and write.* 'Scoundrel' across
the forehead of this Senate. Why should
we fear Andrew M. Lawrence? Wny fear
this hired scribbler of tbe press? Is he
superior to a State Senator? You may fear
him. but thank God, I do not. Neither am
I afraid of the Examiner or any other
journal, because 1 have done nothing
wrong; because in my heart is truth and
right ana justice and manhood; and when
ever there is truth and right and justice
and manhood in a man he iears nothing
save God. [Applause.]
"Why, these gentlemen came before the
committee represented by three of the
ablest lawyers in the State. Think of wit
nesses begging counsel. Then when they
were asked to answer certain questions to
aid tbe committee they relused like a
criminal to i'.o so. Now these righteous
gentlemenâ these polygod-like, excellent
gentlemen of the press â come here and
charge us with being bribe-takers, and
when we ask them, 'Where is your evi
denc, Mr. Lawrence?' he says, 'I decline
to answer?'
â¢â¢'Where is your evidence,' we asked
Mr. Levings, and he says, 'I decline to an
swer. I woul.l have to betray the trust
and confidence placed in me by my em
ployer' â
"An employer who wields this great
engine of phwer to betray the manhood
and womanhood of the Stato ; who
sends his filth and nastiueai, gathered
from the sewers, throughout the State
to the evil of every man and woman in
the commonwealth.
"They will abuse the confidence of
their employer. They did nil abuse the
personal honor of any one when they at
tacked the members of this Senate. The
silence of our voices now writes 'Scoun
drel* on the forehead of every Senator.
Then will any Senator stand here and in
obedience to a great newspaper say: 'Let
us tarn it over to a Grauvj Jury ; we have
not the time to defend oar honorâ tue
Legislature is too short. These things are
always a flash in the pan' ?
'â¢Let us bring these gentlemen up be
fore the bar of justice and let them an
swer, and see if we will not bo through
with this matter. What have they fed
upon that they are superior to us? Did
God Almighty endow them with some
peculiar trail or sanctity that they may
hold themseives upon some high pedestal
and that we must submit to them and
worship them? You may do it if you
want, but as for me, I shall not do it. And
if they refuse to purge themselves of con
tempt, you must punish them as you
wouid any other man who would dare
to assail your personal honor."
Senator Smith was of the opinion that
nothing further should be done, as in his
opinion the Examiner had virtually aban
doned the case, in which it had presumed
to assume the position oi prosecutor. He
spoke as follows:
"It appears to me that there is a differ
ent view to take of this matter. In the
courts of this country if the prosecuting
witness abandons his case he virtually ad
raits he has not proof of the truth of his
accusation. In this case the prosecutor â
the paper that published this charge â has
virtually abandoned the prosecution. It
has declined in every way, shape and
manner to prosecute the case and has ad
mitted that it has no evidence for the
charge. Why should we waste our time
in investigating when the parties who
made .the charge have admitted most em
phatically that there was no foundation
for it?
"In a court it would not take five min
utes for the Judge to dismiss the case un
der similar circumstances. I think that
the Senate haa completely absolved itself
from any charge of corruption and will
stand guiltless before the people of the
State if it abandons. this entire proposition
at this time."
Senator Simpson showed a firm and
courageous disposition to have the matter
carried to a consistent conclusion. He
spoke as iollows: Â»
"I differ from the Senator from Kern.
The Senators upon this floor are the al
leged criminals in this case. If the prose
cution ia abandoned at this time, here
would be a declaration upon the part of
the criminals themselves that the case
had no loundation upon which to stand.
I will say here that if that paper will
come out and state unqualifiedly that it
had no foundation for these charges, I
would then jay that there was evidence
that these members were not truilty. But
when :t devolves upon these members to
declare to themselves that they are* not
guilty, I stand with the Senator from
Santa Clara, and believe that the dignity
of this body should be preserved by the
adoption of this resolution."
Senator Seawell coincided with Senator
Smith that the Senate, in view of the atti
tude of the Examiner, was completely ex
onerated from the charges made by that
paper.
"The attitude of thia paper," ha said, "is
as direct and potential as any answer that
witnesses can make. I stand before you
as having voted for the bill, but I feel that
I am not the least bit soiled or that any
dirt is upon my garments. Why then
place these men in contempt? Their direct
positive answer could add nothing to
change the status of the cane."
Senator PeJlar favored the resolution.
"If the witnesses fail to answer in the Sen
ate," he said, "it would be only proper to
exhaust every means at hand to compel
them to do so."
Senator Jstratton created a mild sensa
tion by i.ir.l:ii'.ii one of the strongest
speeches ag/iinst>Â»he adoption oi the resc
luiion. His course was and is a mystery
to his colleagues in view of the fact that
he voted for Asi#mbly bill 273. He had
the hardihood to assert that the investiga
tion was not ordered for the purpose cf
clearing the Senate of the charges made
against its members, but to "liunin ialc the
Examiner."
Senator Witbington raised his voice
against the resolution, on the ground that
nothing that appeared in the Examiner
was worthy of consideration and that
journal had in its editorial columns ad
mitte i that its charge was unfounded.
Simpson, interrupting, remarked, 'Then
let them so state in their paper."
Withington continual as follows: "This
body should be above fuch criticism. We
have here the menial and not the man.
If we had Hearst here it would be some
what of a different case. The man in
charge of the Examiner now is one of the
least of his subordinates."
Senator Morehous9 took issue with the
last speaker. He said:
"I believe that the gentleman from San
Diego holds a license to practice law, and
that in a court of justice if a material wit
ness refus d to answer, of course the
learm-d counsel would give up his case. He
would not want anytbincr further. Let
them say, 'We have no evidence at all.'
We are not seeking to prosecute the Ex
aminer. The time to prosecute the Ex
aminer is when we have proved it has no
basis for its charges.
"Four years ago its conduct in a similar
case was vastly different. Members of its
s:aff could hardly travel fast, enough to
get belore the committee. They were
actually tumbling over one another to get
their evidence before the committee. They
did not then say that to give such infor
mation as they possessed would be a vio
lation of confidence, and they did not hide
behind the telegraph companies. But we
will bring in Mr. Jaynes, and if he has
any teicgrams that incriminate any man
here we will ask Mr. Jaynes to answer,
and if he refuses we will punish him ac
cordingly. I ask that this resolution be
adopted.".
The roll was called on the resolution,
and it passed, as already stated, by a vote
of 22 to 11. Its adoption was greetea with
hearty hand-clapping and shouts.
During the noon recess the subpenas
were served on the three men, and it was
decided to have the trial at 3 :30 r, m. On tbe
reconvening of the Senate, however, Sena
tor Dickinson announced tnat owing to
tbe absence of George A. Knight, one of
the attorneys for the recalcitrants, and on
the request of the parties interested, the
matter would be deferred until the even
ing session.
Somehow or other the news of the im
pending ordeal for the attaches of the
fake journal spread throughout the city,
and at 7 o'clock there was a fair attend
ance, ana half an hour later, though the
session did not begin until 8 o'clock,
every seat on the floor and in the gallery
was occupied, ladies being present in
large numbers, decked out in all the finery
of a saia night at tbe theater. At 8
o'clock even standing room was at a pre
mium.
A few minute 9 after the session was
called to order Senator Seawell became
tbe target for inquisitive eyes when he
arose ana announced that be had a tele
gram which he wanted to have read by
the secretary. It was quickly placed in
the hands of Mr. Brandon, who scanned
it amid a hush tbat showed there was a
premonition of what was coming. With
tine dramatic effect, in his clear, pene
trating voice, Secretary Brandon read as
follows:
"Senators Dickinson, Sea well and Aram :
Have been detained liere 011 busiutsa all
day. Can you continue hearing until to
morrow morning? George A. Knight."
Senator Seawell explained that he and
Aram had been unable to hnd Dickinson,
and considered it best to refer the matter
to the Senate, and let it do with it as it
thought best. He added that the parties
in interest were prepared to go ahead, but
as Knight had been selected to make the
presentation of the case before the Senate,
they preferred to have a continuance of
the matter until to-morrow.
Senator Dickinson, after apologizing for
participating in the debate at all. owing
to the fact of being chairman of the com
mittee, yet thought it proper to state that
on Friday last a continuance was granted
until Monday with the understanding
that the matter should proceed this after
noon. He concluded as follows:
"I would not have stated this if another
member of the committee had not partici
pated in the matter. I have nothing more
to say."
Senator Mahoney moved that the matter
De continued until 11 o'clock to-morrow
morning.
Senator Morehouse objected to any
further postponement on the ir round thnt
George A. Knight and Andrew J. Clunie
were present, and they wore us as able ut
torneys as there were in the Htate. Ho
caused a ripple of laughter by referring to
the latter gentleman an "my belligerent
little friend, Mr. Clunie."
Wolfe favored the motion to postpono,
while Simpson took atroni; ground against
it. Among other tilings he uaul : "My
convictions are that thin is just what they
want to doâ to carry on the proceedings of
this investigation beyond the line of the
Legislature, in the hope that it will then
be dropped.' '
The motion to postpone was carried by
a vote of 19 to lti, the much wrought up
and disappointed audience quietly tillered
out, and ordinnry business was resumed.
ASSEMBLY INVESTIGATION
Counsel for the Western Union
Argues Aaralnst Obsylnjj the
Draurnet Subpena.
SACRAMENTO. Cal,, March B.â The
Assembly investigating committee went
through a very dull day. One Assembly
man after another was called up and was
asked a set of the most comprehensive
questions by Valentine, as to whether
they had been approached by any one,
member or outsider, and solicited for his
Vote or influence for or against the bill:
whether they knew of any member hav
ing been so approached or bribed, or
whether they had ever heard of any
such things. They all replied in the
negative.
Senator Morehouse appeared before the
committee and testified that be had not
heard even the rumor of bribery in con
nection with the name of any member of
the Assembly or the Senate. On being
asked whether he had received any tele
grams in relation to Caminetti's bill,
273, he replied that he had received a dis
patch from W. F. Herrin after the roll
had been called in the Senate on the bill,
and after the bill had been passed. He
had not the dispatch with him, but would
go and get it. He added that Senator
Langford had requested him as a special
favor to vote fur the bill.
In the afternoon Superintendent Jaynes
of the Western Unidn Telegraph Com
pany appeared before the Assembly com
mittee with his attorney, K. B. Carpenter,
to oppo-e the subpena duces tecum re
quiring him to produce before the com
mittee all telegrams sent or received by
each one of tne fifty-one members of the
Assemb'y who voted for the passage of
Caminetti's bill. At the beginning of
Judge Carpenter's argument Senator
Morchoii-e handed to the committee a dis
patch reading as follows:
San Francisco. Feb. 23, 1897.
To Eon. H. V. Morthouse, Saeramcntn .- Please
let up in your opposition to Assembly bill
273. Will explain when I see you.
William F. Hermn.
" Judge Carpenter argued that the sub
pena was not binding. The subject mat
ter of the dispatches must be given, other
wise his client could not bo compelled to
answer. The subject matter should be
particularized.
Assemblyman Valentine argued that
the procee.lingsjin the Supreme Court were
based upon a proceeding in the lower
court, but that in an investigation by a
legislative committee the law allowed
more latitude. In the case of D. O. Mc-
Caittiy the rule was laid down that the
Legislature had greater powers than the
courts. He thought that the committee
had power to issue the subi ena for all
telegrams relating to Assembly bill 273.
Clunie said that there was a later de
cision by District Court Judge Morrow, in
which lie said that the description given
i>i the subpena was sufficient. That casa
wrs to be found in the sixty-third Federal
reporis.
Chairman Belshaw read the evidence of
Alvinza Hay ward and Senator Voorheis,
giving their consent to the production of
all telegrams sent by or received by them
in relation to Assembly bill 273.
"The case of ex pane Jaynes is not over
ruled by the Di-trict Judge of the United
States," said Judge Carpenter. "I sug
gest that as to the law governing this com
mittee and as to the proposition that this
Legislature is above the law and the
courts there is no authority for such a
statement and 1 utterly scout it. The- law
that protects the humblest citizen guides
the highest official. This dragnet subneaa
is of no avail and of no force. There is no
allegation in any of those telegrams that
any member of either house was bribed.
This dragnet through the telegraph office
to rake up and bring up all the telegrams
of the company in the hope of finding that
there has been some offense aguinst the
law is not a valid subpena and my client
cannot be compelled to produce those
telegrams and that is just what they say
in the seventieth California reports. You
must ask for the telegram which tends to
prove a crime and what that telegram
specifies, it is simply an effort to fi-ia
some testimony that you absolutely know
nothing about.''
The committee adjourned until to-mor
row morning at 9 o'clock.
IX SEN Alt' AM* ASSEMBLE.

Francisco, and could not be present to
night, and urged that the proceedings in
the Examiner contempt case be postponed
until to-morrow.
Seawell made a motion to this effect.
Morehouse and Simpson opposed it, but
the motion carried by a vote of 19 to lb,
and the matter was postponed until ll
o'clock to-morrow.
The following Senate bills were passed:
By Morehouse, amending section 1410

explanation of votes.

l>i t'.-ni of the Amendment to Bntitle
Women to Votf.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March B.â The
woman's suffrage amendment was de
feated in the Assembly to-night alter a
spirited debate. Dryden led the debate
and said that the women in the campaign
last fall absolutely lifted the question out
of the diit of politics. They had Bhown
by their conduct of the campaign that
they could purify politics and make the
act of voting a respectable one. He asked
why had women been denied the right,
pnd he gave the answer that the denial
was due to prejudice arising out of the old
idea of woman's inferiority to man be
cause she had been the first to sin. This
doctrine could be traced down all through
the ages that woman was made as helper
to man, and "she had been made to chop
wood, bake bread and dress kids" from
time immemorial.
"You were asked last fall," he added,
"to get upon the platform and give a rea
son why women should not have the right
of suffrnge, but you did not because you
bad no reasons."
The speaker mentioned Mrs. Leland
Stanford, the owner of large properties.
While old, greasy Shacknasty Jim, who
does not own anything but his clothes,
can walk up to the ballot-box and vote to
tax her property, she is denied either
voice or vote in lhe matter.
Dryden made a stirring appeal and was
greeted with handclapping.
Treacy moved the 'previous question
and Toiand at the same time attempted
to introduce a substitute which was
kindly intended to kill or cripple the
amendment. T.'ie substitute was not con
sidered and the roll was cailed. The
amendment was defeated by a vote of 44
ayes to 26 noes, being ten votes short of
the required two-tuirds.
Leavitt and Toiand explained that th,ey
had voted against the amendment De
cause the people had defeated the propo
sition at the polls last fail. Toiand said
that bis substitute provided to give women
the right of suffrage for fourteen years, at
the end of which time the right would ex
pire. Canavan of San Francisco said that
he voted aye an<i he had no apoioey to
make. Cross of Los Angeles said that he
voted no because the women did not desire
the ballot.
Serxuue and Taxation.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March B.âDib
ble made a great speech in the Assembly
to-night in favor of the passage of consti
tutional amendment 40, relating to
revenue and taxation. The amendment
proposes to allow the Legislature to estab
lish any form of taxation it may select.
Dibble said that something must be done
in the way of right and justice to the
peopie to do away with the dangers of so
cialism and anarchy.
Treacy reminded his Democratic friends
that the Iroquois Club of San Francisco
bad petitioned in favor or the amend
ment, and that it was a broad question
witfcou; any party politics. The resolu
tion was passed by a voie of 54 ayes and
16 noes, and there was much hand-clap

This Brutal Butcher Declares

A Young Kinsman of President Cis
neros Dying From the Effects of
Inhuman Treatment. l
NEW YORK, N. V., March 9.â A spe
cial to the World from Havana via Jack
sonville, Fia., says: General Weyler has
issued an order directing that hereafter
all women arrested in Cuba who are called
"suspicious" shall be tried by court-mar
tial. While the penalty is not publicly
stated it is supposed that if the women
are found guilty the death penalty will be
imposed.
The issuing of this order has been pro
tested acainit by some of the foreign Con
suls..
General Weyler says, it is asserted, that
the women are hardest to subdue and that
if he had his way he would kill them first
and try them afterward.
A kinsman of the first president of the
rrpublic has been arrested and treated in
the most crjel manner possible. He was
imprisoned in a small cell 6x9 and kept
incommunicado 100 days. Hs had only
one meal a day, slieht at that; was re
duced to a skeleton by inhuman treatment
and is now dying from the effects. He is
oniy lti years old.
TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
B'cretartj Shrrmnn Will Srnd Warship*
to Cuba When - y ecti* *Â«r</.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 8.-A Snn
Washington special says: There will be
no reduction of the strength of the North
Atlantic station as long as the Cuban
question remain? prominent and every
vessel now attached to Admiral Bunco's
squadron wiil be retained in service
and others added as fast as ready for sea.
This policy has been determined upon !
already by the administration, and is be- j
Leved to be because of the larse number
of Americans now under arrest in Cnba
a:id the intention of the administration to
afford them full protection.
If the fate of Dr. Ruiz befalls another
American citizen, it is believed that Sec
retary Sherman will call at once for a fleet
of warships for immediate service at Ha
vana to support whatever claims may be
made by the Consul-General.
The presence of a warship there would
be in accordance with the suggestion of
General Lee to Mr. Oiney last month, and
there are strong indications that Mr.
Sherman, in any event, will ask that at
least one naval vessel be stationed in
Cishan waters. There is no question that
.American citizen is dealt harshly
with by fLe-Spaniard-" a war vessel will
soon be oa its way to Havana.
To-day S cretary Sherman spent over
an hour with the President in a discus
sion of the Cuban question, and particu
larly the cases of two Americans now
under arrest, and one of whom has sent
an urgent appeal here for aid, represent
ing that he is liable at any time to meet
the fate that befell Ruiz.
Secretary Sherman, it was stated this
afternoon, will communicate with Gen
eral Lee and urge him to present to the
Spanish ofiicials the firm protest of this
Government against unfair treatments of
Americans on the island, whether their
nativity is doubted or not.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March B.âPresi
dent McKinley proved his intention of be-
Ine as democratic as possible during his
< "fticial residence in Washington by taking
another walk tli i -Â» afternoon through a
'jiKjt'of town frequented by promenaders
"at that hour. He had been subjected to a
iiard day of it, and when tha last caller
had gone, shortly before 5 o'clock, he
Walked out of the front door of the White
House with Secretary Porter. Many peo
ple recognized the President before he
reached the east gate of the grounds, and
their salutations were responded to cor
dially. At the gate half a dozen people
held up the President and shook hands
with him. Then he struck across Pennsyl
vania avenue and up Madison place to
Vermont avenue. They were back at the
White HouÂ«e by G o'clock.

Mr. Porter a note which was said to be a
request from "her gracious majesty" as
he calls Liiitiokalani, for an audience at
an early date.
More than a thousand people shook

TRAIN-ROBBERS IN LUCK.
A Snowstorm and a Belated Train Pre
vents Their Anmhilaton by Armed
Deputies.
ST. PAUL, Minx., March B.â A dis
patch Irom Chippewa Falls, W;s., says:
A snowstorm and a belated passenger
train were two circumstances that pro
bably prevented a bloody encounter be
tween a cans of bandits and a hundred or
more armed deputies last night.
A few days ago the Omahti officials re
ceived information to the effect that an
attempt would be made to hold up the
Duluth Limited, which leaves [Superior
for Eau Claire at 5:30 in the afternoon.
The place selected is a lonely spot in a
forest about three miles north of Haw
thorne, and if the train is on time it ar
rives there about 7 o'clock in the evening.
Had the Dulnth train not been delayed
six hours in a snowdrift the bandits would
have received the warmest reception last
input ever accorded a gang of desperadoes
bent on mischief.
The baggage and mail cars were filled
with armed deputies, who were ready to
open fire at a moment's notice.
The men were quietly taken aboard at
Superior Junction ami were given careful
in>truciions by the officials of the road,
who were notified as to the plans of the
robbers. It was their plan to flag the train,
and just as soon as it slowed up sufficiently
two men were to secure control ot the
engine, while the rest of the gang rifled
the mail and baggage cars and went
through the passengers in the coaches.
The Omaha officials prepared to allow
the bandits to carry out their programme
as to the flagging of the train, but an en
tire change of scenery had been arranged
for the second act, in which it was pro
posed to drop the curtain on the gang of
desperadoes but for the heavy snowstorm
which held tne train at Superior Junction
until 2 o'clock this morning.
When it arrived at tbe scene of the pro
posed robbery the bandits had taken their
departure, having evidently abandoned
the attempt for the night. The passen
uers knew nothing of what was in store
lor them uniil the danger point was
passed, when the stjry leaked out. It is
understood ihat one of the gang furnished
the officials with the entire plan which
the robbers had adopted.

her physician abandoned hope.
She was visiting her son-in-law. Rev.

the time the accident occurred. Her ad
vanced age, 84, made her recovery very
doubtful.
MRS. BEECHER'S CAREER.
Active In the Cause of Humanity to
the Very Close.
Eunice White, wife of Henry Ward
Beecher, was born in West Button,
Worcester County, Mass., August 25, 1812.
She was educated at Hadley, MaÂ«s. When
Mr. Beecher settled in his pastorate in
Lawrenceburgh, Ind., he returned to the
East to claim his bride, after an engage
ment extending over seven years. Mrs.
Beecher has been a contributor, chiefly on
domestic subjects, to various periodical",
and some of her articles have been pub
lished in book form. During a long and
tedious illness in her earlier married life
she wrote a series of reminiscences of her
first years as a minister's wife, afterward
published with the title "From Dawn to
j Daylight: A Simple Story of a Western
Home" (1859), under the pen name of "A
Mini>ter's Wife." She has also published
"Motherly Talks With Young House
keepers" (New York, 1875). 'Letters From
Florida" (1873), "All Around the House,
or How to Make Homes Happy" (1878)
and "Home" (1883). Of recent years she
had contributed to Eastern periodicals,
.one of her latest articles being in the New
York World and on the subject of "New
Women."
Wuen Mr. Beecher died in 1887 he did
not leave a large estate, the estimated
amount of his wealth beinga sum ranging
from $75,000 to $150,000. Mr. Beecher' s
salary lor the fifty years that he was in
active work as a preacher averaged $10,000
a year, and during the last twelve years
of his ministry of Plymouth Church his
salary was $20,000 a year. His total in
come from lectures and addresses was
$oU),000, and from his books and other
literary work $200,000, making in round
numbers the sum earned by voice and pen
fully $1,000,000.
It is well known that Mr. Beecher did
not place any value upon money, and hu
eot rid of it as fast as it came in by giving
it away in charity, buying precious stones
and works of art. and in living expense?.
Mrs. Beecher tried to run the business end
of the househould, and it was mainly
through her efforts that Air. Beecher left
any estate of all.
Mr. Beecher's life was insured for
$25,000, and by his will he provided that it
bo invested and the income paid to Mrs.
Beecher during her lifetime. The rest of
tao estate, which included a foO.OOO farm
at Peekskiil, was lei: to Mrs. Harriet E.
Scov.lle, Henry B. Beecher, William C.
Beecher and Herbert P. Beecher, with in
struction to dispose of it in any way that
the executors might see lit for the benelit
of the children, who were all of age.
Mrs. Beecher was one of the remarkable
women of the century. Her prominence
was not entirely due to the splendid posi
tion won by the great divine whose wife
she was, though that in itself would
have given eminence to a common place
character. She had the force and strong
personality that would have given her
po&ition in any society with which she
might be associated. Indeed, it may oe
asserted with truth that her being the
wife of so great a man tended to dwarf
her own strong individuality by its con
trast. She showed her tideiity at a time
when the clouds hung blackest about her
husband, and proved that no matter who
might be skeptical, she, whose life and
happiness wero most concerned, never en
tertained a doubt, never wavered in her
loving loyalty and wifely devotion.
Since 1847 Mrs. Beecher lias been a resi
dent of Brooklyn; that city was the scene
of her husband's greatest i rials and tri
umphs. In it nearly all her children were
born; there are the many friands who
have grown up or grown old with her, and
there are the associations that give a
golden glow to the sunset of her life.
The fine mansion on Hicks street, in
which Mrs. Beecher lived till her hus
band's death, she still owned, and derived
from it a handsome rental; but not far
away, and nearly in the shadow of the
church which her husband made famous,
and a shrine for millions ot admiring pil
erims, she had a cozy little home all to
herselfâ and one servant. Thi* house is
at the corner of Hicks and Orange streets,
the parlor windows having a sunny ex
posure.
Last April Elizabeth G. Jordan contrib
uted the following to the New York Sun
day World :
Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher will be 84 years of
age on August '26. The illustrations which
appear on this page, and which are made lrom
photojraphs of her taken in her home last
Monday, will interest thousands of perrons
who read her contributions to the Sunday
World every week and who know her only
through her published woric.
Mrs. Beecher deserves to be known even
better than this. There is much in her daily
life and character to appeal to students of
human nature. She has apparently discovered
two great secrets which most human beings
die without finding outâ the secret of per
petual youth and the secret of contentment.
Certainly no woman of 8-4 looks younger, and
very few of any age look more serene than
she. It is hard to realize that she has lived a
long time and has suffered a great deal, and
that h.cr mental attitude to-day Is one of
patient waiting for the end.
In appearance Mrs. Boecher is a small, deli-
cate woman, bent a little by the weight of her
years, but alert of motion and exceeding care
ful as to dress.' The lace caps she wears are
adorned by delicate lavender, ribbons, which
are renewed daily. She makes her plain black
gowns herself, and they would do credit to any
d rejsmafcer. * Tli'Mr : flt and JJ?Mi ? &"are perfect,
add the little ruffles at the neckband waist are
freshened and sewn in by Mrs. Beecher every
morning.. She is not averse to ornaments.
One notices, among . others, a ; large, old
fashioned cameo brooch, small cameoearrincs,
B silver eyeglass guard and a watch with a
long and glittering chain, -which is very
striking. She also wears on the first finger of
her right hand a seal ring that belonged to
Mr. Beecher, and that she prizes above most
things. Her complexion is like old ivory.
Time has traced innumerable wrinkles there,
but her features are still perfect aud her face
is almost beautiful. It is set in a frame of
white hair, against which the cobwebby cap
and the lavender ribbons rest effectively.
There is no slavish following of fashion in
Mrs. Beecher's case. Her sleeves are good
plain sleeves, with no especial fullness at
shoulder or elbow, and her feet find comfort
in the fine old congress gaiters, also worn by
Queen Victoria and other excellent women of
advanced years. Mrs. Beecher's blood does
not flow as freely through her veins as it did
half a century ago, so she usually â¢ wears a
little woolen shawl over her shoulders and
has a warm fire in the grate when other citi
zens of Brooklyn are sitting before open win
dows in their shirt waists.
As to Mrs. Beccher's home life she describes
it in a few words. "I do as much," she says,
"as my front door beil will allow me to do."
She lives alone with one servant, bat as tne
littie maid is usually busy downstairs Mrs.
Beecher answers the b- 11 herself in the most
democratic fashion. The occupation is quite
enough for one able-bodied woman. Fromnany
morn till late at night that bell sends forth its
summons. Old friends call "to see how the
dear womnn is getting alone." Young triends
come because Mrs. Beecher loves young girls
and they love her. She is a most sympathetic
listener and her advice is asked in numerous
delicate affairs. Children come for "stories,"
and women reporters arrive in battalions to
know her views on every subject from the
making of a Welsh rarebit to the Monroe Doc
trine. Book agents piesent themselves, and
this noble Christian woman receives and lis
tens to them. And the autograph fiend and
the old college friend ot her husband, and
former members of hiÂ« church all join the pro
cession that wrnds its way daily to the little
red house on the corner of Hicks and Orange
streots. In the intervals of these visits Mrs.
Beecher sews, writes, reads, dusts, arranges
the furniture and holds long conversational
sessions wltli the fifteen birds that are the joy
of her heart.
These birds occupy one immense cage in the
window of tne little back parlor. There are
five canaries, a love bird and a number of
Javas and their incessant twittering and
whistling would drive a nervous woman mad.
Mrs. Beecher is not a nervous woman. She
likes the noise although she confesses that she
keeps a'l the birds In one cace because their
singing, if they were caged separately, would
be too much even for her. She can distingu.sh
each bird's note among the general uproar,
and she encourages tnem to fresh efforts by
chirruping in return. A great deal of her
time is spent with these birdÂ«, for Mr. Beecher
loved them. She feeds them, keeps them sup
plied with seed and water, cleans their cages
and takes care of them when they are sick.
There is plenty of time for all these duties,
for Mrs. Beecher sleeps only rive hours out of
the twenty-lour. She is always up at 5 in the
morning and never goes to bed before mid
night. It is no unusual thing for her to work
all night and satisfy nature with a short nap
in the afternoon. She does not feel the need
of Rlf ep and a heart trouble to which she Is
subject makes a recumbent position very pain
ful.
Several years ago Mrs. B.echer was asked
the secret of her youthfulness. -'If there is
one," Bhc replied, "it lies in the fact that I
have resolved never to become 'an old
woman."' She has kCDt this resolution well,
nnd her greatest aids have probably been lier
keen interest in human nature and her ex
traordinary sense of humor. She responds to
a joke hs if she were "0. Then, too, she lives
very much outside of herself. Tiie memory of
Mr. Beecher is always with her, and she be
lieves very (irmly that in a few years she will
be with him again. In the meantime t-he lives
a= she feels that he would have her liveâ.se
renely ana contentedly, making the most of
the little pleasures that come to her, and
tbrowine off the cares and worries with the
reflection that ia the nature of things they
cannot matter.
BOYS ESSAY TO
WRECK A TRAIN
Disaster to the Monterey
Express Narrowly
Averted.
Youths Place Dynamite on the
Track Near Murphys
Station.
Only a Portion of the Explosive Is
Touched Off, bat Cons durable
Damage Results.
SAN JOSE. Cal., March B.â Two boys
were arrested near Mountain View to-day
and lodged in the County Jail on a charge
of having attempted to wreck a train.
The prisoners are John Ciravegna, aged 18
years, and Peter Ciravegna, aged 14 years.
It is alleged that the boys placed sticks of
dynamite on the railroad track a short
distance north of Murphys station, oppo
site a place where they were engaged in
chopping wood and clearing land.
Some injury was done to the Monterey
express train 13, on its way to San Fran
cisco, last Saturday afternoon. At the
point indicated there was an explosion of
sufficient force to shatter the headlight of
the locomotive. The engineer supposed
that a torpedo had been run over. The
explosion did no damage to the track, but
the occurrence was reported to the rail
road authorities in San Francisco. On in
vestigation the conclusion was arrived at
that a small torpedo nad been placea on
the rail for sport by some boys.
On Sunday afternoon, the day following
this occurrence, three boysâ Charles Bar
ney, John Barney and Conti Belloniâ
were walking along the track on the way
to Mountain View when they saw an ob
ject that proved to be a stick of giant
powder tied to the rail. Their first thought
was to remove it, but one of them ex
pressed the fear that somebody might be
lying in ambush who would take a shot
at them should they attempt to remove
the explosive. The boys had an idea that
the bomb had been placed there by train
rubbers, the object being to stop the pas
senger train that was soon due past that
point from Monterey gome north.
The boys were about to run for help and
to warn s^ome one at Murphys station
when they heard the train coming. Quick
action was then necessary, and they
hurriedly removed the bomb from the
track and took it to Mountain View and
reported the occurrence.
In answer to a telegram, instructions
were tent from San Francisco that the
track should be cuarded over nigtit. For
a distance ol a mile on each side of the
place where the explosion occurred and
the bomb was found, the track was
patroled during Sunday night by section
employes under tho direction of Constable
I J. D. Martin and Deputy Sheriff Zach
I Martin. There were no developments
| during Sunday night.
This morning Constable Martin arrested
| two drunken tramps on suspicion that
I they were the persons who had placed the
j bombs on tne tract. Shortly afterward
Special Officer C. C. Crowley of the South
ern Pacific Company arrived on the scene.
He immediately ordered the release of the
I tramps, as they were evidently not the
j men wanted.
In tho meantime the Martins had secured
j a strong clew implicating the two boys who
j were living in a cabin near the track, and
i were engaged in blasting stumps and chop-
I ping wood on land in the Murphy tract.
Giant powder cartridges and caps similar
to those that had been placed on the track
were found in the cabin, and one of the
boys explained how he placed the cap in
the cartridge, the method being exactly
the same as that used in the track bomb.
The information was obtained by the
officers while they where disguised as
woodchoppers. At the same time one of
the boys said a bomo had been placed on
the track by a Portuguesn boy.
The evidence that had been obtained
against them was repoited to Special Offi
cer Crowley and he immediately ordered
the arrest of the boys. They were brought
jto the county jail this evening. After
j their arrest they were very much fright
j ened and denied thai they knew anything
I about the explosion or how the bomb came
to be on the track. The officers believe
that it was a boyish prank, done without
nny realization of how serious the conse
quences might be.
. The stick of giant powder placed on the
I rail was about ten inches long. It had
| been cut in two and a percussion cap was
placed in each end. If the wheel of the
engine had struck it there would have
been an explosion of sufficient force, it Is
asserted, to break a wheel, and then there
would have been a pile-up of the heavily
loaded passenger coaches, with possibly
great loss of life. The sticks of giant pow
der that wera found on the track and in
the cabin were brought to the county jail
with the prisoners.
The boys will be arraigned upon the
charge to-morrow.
ROMANCE CF ALVISQ SLOUGH.
Treasure Found in an Ark That Had
Been the Home of a Hermit
Fisherman.
SAN JOSE, Cat-., March B.â The story of
an old hermit's death and the squander
ing of hia gold proved a highly interesting
topic iii Judge Hyland's department of
the Superior Court this afternoon.
Charles F. Rodman, an old fisherman
who had made his home in an ark on
the bank of Aivisj Slough for upward of
thirty years, was found uead in his cabin
on September 16 last. When the remains
were found they were merely a lot of
bones, and Rodman had evidently been
dead for several months. He seldom went
any where and his disappearance bad not
been noticed.
Coroner Secord was notified and an in
quest was held. Although Rodman was
supposed to have had a hoard of money,
the Coroner found only 50 cents and an
old c:iain in the ark. He sold the chain
for $2 50 and the ark for $5 and the pro
ceed* helped to pay the county for Rod
man's burial.
The ark was purchased by George Em
ory of Alviao. Soon afterward Emory ap
peared with a lot of tine clothes â some
thins unusual for him. He then took a
trip East. Before starting he purchased
considerable jewelry and exhibited gold
coins of all denominations. Where Em
ory obtained his money was a mystery,
but he mentioned it as merely a windra.i
from a deceased Eastern relative. This
was not believed, and stones of all kinds
about Emory finding :he old hermit's
hoard of gold were current.
Emory returned from the East a couple
of weeks ago, and Coroner Secord determ
ined to rind lout whether his suddenly ac
quired weahh was treasure found in Rod
man's ark. A trap was set, and last night
Emory was made drunk at Alviso. Un
der a pumping process he said he hap
found "loads of wealth" in the ark. he
also exhibited what purported to be> a
$1000 United States bond, "which he said
was found amon^ the effects.
To-day Public Adminimator Secord
got special letters of administration on
lhe estate, and Emory, who was in San
Jose, was cited to appear in court ana tell
about his find. An otlicer found him in a
saloon and broueht him inio court. On
the witness-stand he admitted that he and
a man named Beard had found $1603 in a
buckskin belt under the roof of the ark.
He said they divided the money equally.
He finally admitted he had found an as
signed bond of 1861 for $1000. He produced
the latter when District Attorney Har
ring'.on asked for it.
Emory said he was not the only lucky
one. Tnere were ut tiers who found money.
He haa heard of three persons who had
discovered $500.
It is believed that Emory and others
found quite a sum of money in the hut.
Coroner Secord hopes to recover some of
the treasure, if there is any left.
It is understood that Emory presented
some treasury notes at the United States
Sub-Treasury in San Francisco for pay
ment, but they declined to cash them.
The officers Rujrzested that Uiey could
send them on to Washington for collec
tion, but Emory would not trust them,
and so went East to cash the bonds him
self.

IDAHO'S LEGISLATIVE SCANDAL
Failure of the Attempt to Expel Members
Implicated by the Briber/
Expose.
BOISE. Idaho, March B.â The report of
the committee investigating the bribery
charges in the matter of the election of
United States Senator Heitfeld came up
for consideration In the Legislature to-day
and a decidedly warm discussion ensued.
The report declares that H. S. Joir.es
did on several occasions try to procure
money surreptitiously from different per
sons; that, while the evidence against
Perkins is not so strong as that against
Joines, the former is highly culpable. The
report says that the evidence discloses
that money had been freely offered for
corrupt purposes by otuer persons, and
recommends that both Joines and Perkins
be expelled from the house.
A motion in the Legislature to adopt
the resolution in regard to Perkins resulted
22 for and 22 against, and the Sneaker cast
i the deciding vote against, thus saving
Perkins.
The motion to adopt the report in re
gard to Joines was carried unanimously,
but the rc-olution to expel him Irom the
| House failed to qarry by a vote of 26 to 16.
The action of the House in refusing to
| make an example of both Joines and
Peruins is severely criticized, and it is
asserted tliat the reason lor the action
of the iiHJuicr* in the matter is that
many of them are no less culpable than
the two who have been bublicly accused.

Furor Created in Santa

Exploit.

Rosalind.
To Earn a Living She Adopted Male
Garb and a Populace Was
Deceived.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March B.â Several
months ago a smooth-faced, good-looking
young man, going by the name of "Billy 1 '
Johnson, arrived in this city looking for
work. Ue was not fastidious as to his
employment, as long as it yielded him a
living, and often earned an honest penny
by splitting and cording stove wood. Ha
at last secured a steady place in a restau
rant on Main street, where he became a
great favorite with the customers because
of his polite and affable ways.
But the restaurant-keeper's wife took
an unaccountable dislike to "Billy," and
insisted upon his discharge. Vainly the
husband pointed out the good qualities
and popularity of hjs black-eyed, dapper
little waiter. "Billy" had to go.
Just where he went no one seems to
know, but when he returned correctly at
tired as a modern, up-to-date young lady,
and it became definitely known that
"Billy" was a girl, the surprise created by
the change can be easily imagined. Many
of the young waiter's" former associates re
fused to believe the reports, and this after
noon the house where "Miss Billy" is
stopping was besieged by cailers. Sue re
ceived her old companions with a hearty
handshake, and seemed greatly pleased
when complimented upon her improved
apnearance.
One of the waiters in the restaurant
where "Billy" formerly worked and with
whom "Billy" formerly roomed learned
of his room-mate's change of condition to
day, and absolutely refused to believe the
story until brought face to face with her.
It fa said that the young wcmau has
always led a correct life, and she claims
to have been forced to thus masquerade in
order to earn an honest living.

Nature of the Subject Under Dis

Secret.
MRS. FITZ IMMONS JOINS HER
HUSBAND.
The Cornishman Takes a Holiday in
Honor of the Coming of Wife
and Boy.
CARSON. New, March 8,-Grave ru
mors are afloat to-ni^ht la Carson to the
effect that after all lhat had been said re
garding the absolute immunity the Cor
b*t*>FitZÃimmona battle will enjoy, po far
1 as legal interference is concerned, there
still remains a question as to whether or
not the Federal Government cannot hold I
up 8 warning Jincer and forbid the hold
ing of the contest. Whether or not these
rumors have any substantial basis, or in
fact any foundation in fact at all, it seems
next to impo&siblÂ« for me to state to
night; but tnere is certainly "something
in the wind" which is causing more than
ordinary anxiety amonÂ« those who are in
terested in seeing the big mill successfully
brought off.
This much 1 know: During several
hours to-day Al Livingston, who is Dan
BtUart'i right-hand man. has been hunt
ing up several officers representing the j
Federal Government here and hurrying
them into a bacs room in the Arlington
Hotel. Here he has oeen clos-'ed with
several of them, separately, for an hour at |
a time. Now what theÂ«<Â« conferences were >
about is jus; what nobody can be made to
admit that they know, and what those
who ought to know declare was simply a
little niattfr of busines-. The counte
nances of the mm who went into and out
of that room plainly indicated that they
hail not trone there to discuss any trivial
matter, and it wa< this very fact that
.-t.irtcd the stories beinj? bruited about to
night that trouble of ?orne sort is brewing.
"Whether it portends possible interfer

but in the face of the opinion given by
Circuit Judge MeKenna (now United
States Attorney-General McKenaa) of San
Francisco to the effect that the United
States authorities could la DO way prevent
the battle, Nevada having once legalized
it, I am inclined to mink that subsequent
events will demonstrate that ;hese disturb
ing rumors have but little of substance be
hind them.
United States Attorney Jones r.ssumed
an air of mystery when I spoku 10 him to
night about the secrei conferences, and â 
yet at'the same time his demeanor was
scarcely such as would convey the impres
sion that all augured- well for the ap
proaching contest.
"The subject of my conversation wilh

entirely of a private natureâ purely busi-
BsHj you kuow."
"But it is rumored," I said, "that there

thtt is, the secret and mysterious nature
of those back-room interviews has givec
rise to such a story. "
"Well," replied the United State* At

notice this affair at all, either officially or
otherwise. If it did contemplate taking
any action it is hardly likely that it would
permit its operations to attain so much
prominence. Do you understand what I
mean?"
I must confess that I did not, and do
not understand just what he meant. In
consequnnce, I can only repro luce his
words and lei the sporting world worry
over them.
There was nothing of the mysterious
ebout United States Marshal Humphrey
when I approached him regarding the
matter, but at the same time he evinced
no inclination to d.vulge anything regard
ing what transpired in the Arlington
Hotel when he was cioseted with Living
ston.
"Ob, that was only a little matter that
! had no public interest attached to it what
ever." said Humphrey. "In fact I have
forgotten really all that was said there.
You say there is a rumor that the Govern
ment might interfere with the Corbett-
Fitzsimmons contest after all? Well, now,
I don't think there is anything in that.
My talk with Mr. Livingston certainly did
| touch seriously on anything of the kind.
I Of course 1 don't know what passed be
tween him and the other Federal official?.
The rumors, I think, are simply revivals
rf the old story ot many weeks ago. when
I ami several other government officials
rind a talk on a San Francisco-bound train.
You will remember that it waÂ« published
at that time that the Federal authorities
had agreed that they couid step in and
interfere with the holding of the hftht, but
it afterward developed that thera was
nothing in this and there was no law that
would permit t lie Government to stop the
ii^ it. 1 think you will lind that these
recent yarns fount their origin in that
tirst story."
This may be all true, but it would
scarcely cause the anxiety that is to be
noticed in certain quarter?. The true in
wardness is bound to come out, and we
mus: be patient.
Tlie event tc-day so far, as anything of
interest concerning either of the tin
pugilists is concerned, was the arrival in
Csrson of Mrs. F>ob Fitzsimmons and
Baby Fi'.z. J"he Cornishman was early
out of bed in nnticipation of his better
li& f's coming, and he was so worked up
over the prospect of beholding his two
dear ones after weeks of separation from
them that he even neglected to go out toi

hills, as is his wont. Immediately after
| breakfast he notified Roeber, the wrestler,
to make ready to accompany nim into
town, and live minutes later the two
gladiators, accompanied by Martin Julian,
who is Mrs. Fitz-iiumons' brother, and
the Great Dane Yarrura left Cook's ranch
and were on their way toward Carson.
There was quite a crowd at the depot at
train time, for the word had gone out that
Mrs. Fitzsimmons was cominsr, and peo
ple were not only eager to have a look at
her, but were equally interested in seeing
i how Fitzsimmons himself looked after his
j three weeks of training in the snow. The
train finally came rumbling in, and while
I every face in the big crowd was scanning
I the windows the most expectant counte
nance of the lot was that of the red
j headed pugilist. And why not?
As the single coach passed the depot
Bob elbewed his way through the crowd,
in the hope of catching up to the steps
from which he was to assist his wife.
"Hi, I see her!" he suddenly shouted,
waving his hand to his companions, and
1 then he sprinted after the car. which was
now coming to a stop. Then Mrs. Fitz
simmons' pretty end laughing face was
seen and in a moment she was enfolded in
'â  the arms of the brawny boxer.
But his joy was not ull for her. "Where's
i the kid?" he anxiously inquired.
"Oli, he's all right â he's coming," re
j plied Mrs. Bob.
Then h nursegirl emerged from the car
I bearing in her arms the apple of the Cor
nisiiman's eye. In a twinkling the baby
was snatched from the nurse's arms and
Fitzsimmons was tossing it and cackling
like a schoolboy.
"Don't you know your daddy?"' said
Fitzsimmons, holding the little one at
arms' length and gazing on him fondly.
The youngster sputtered something
which BoD accepted as an expression in
the affirmative.
"You bet yonr life he does," said the
pugilist, and then he held the astonished
babe aloft so that tue crowd could admire
and comment.
The Fitzsimmons family was soon on
the way back to Cooky ranch, where the
wife and ba< y were installed as bosses of
the place. Mrs. Fitzsimmons will remain
with her husband until after the great
fignt. In honor of her arrival Bob
knocked off work lor the day and spent
the time in showing her around the place,
telling her of his experiences since leav
ing her in New York and in teaching the
"Kid" how to make snowballs.
It is understood that there is to be an
important change in Fitzsknmons'
method of training, to go into effect to
morrow or the n"it day. The Cornish
man's trainers and him: elf as well are sat
isfied that he has reached t lie very acme
of perfection la regard to condition, and
the theory is that he will be in better
shape iyr the light if he la sept right
where he is, rather than continue his vio
lent exercise. Asa matter of fact, many
experts think that Bob works too bard,
and there is a rectlessness about bis prac
tice that renders him constantly liable to
accident or injury. He already sports a
black eye and split lip and his arms are
sore from the elbows to the wrists 33 the
results of his bouts with Hicfcey, Stelzner
and Roeber. li- 1 needs a rest and is going
to take it.
I am given to understand that from now
on wrestling will not comprise a portion
of Fitzsirumons' training routine. His
wort with the wrist machine is also to be
i dropped. Hereafter he intend* to confine
himself more to road running, ami whun
indoors he will indulge in light boxing,
but nothing more.
Jim Corbett hos also eaÂ«ed off with his
work. He has none of the soreness and
bruises that Fitssimmoos complains of,
I for the Caiiforman has throughout his
i preparatory work beeu extremely careful
to avoid these very things. His reasons
for adopting lighter work are otherwise
j similar to tho>e given out by the Corn'.su
' man. Jim feeis that he has rounded into
exactly the form that iÂ« necessary for a
â  championship battle, and he believes in
â¢ letting well enough alone. Trainers De
-1 l.iney and White are of the ssrue opinion.
Their aim iroru now on will rÂ«e to Uee-p

AL SMITH ARRIVES.
The Stake- Holder n*it* Thit City for
the Flr*t Time in Tears.
Al Smith, stake-holdor for the Corbett-
Fitzsiminons fight, arrived in San Fran
cisco at 9 o'clock last niÃhht on the ov in
land train from New York and went to
the Palace Hotel, which will be his head
quarters until end of the week, when
he will leave for Carson.
"The stake money I hold amounts to
$30,000," said he. "It is in several certi
tied checks. There is one for $15,000. de
posited by Stuart, there are two of $5000,
the sdde bet of each of the principals.
Then there are two for $2500 each, pnt up
by Corbett and Fitzsimnions as a guar
antee for their appearance in the ring.
This last money will otcourse be reiunded
when the men enter the ring, but the
$2. r ),000 will nil go to the winner.
"In New York the betting had been 100
to SO, an.i when I left it was that way,
with very little 80 in sight. There seemed
to be plenty of Corbett money, but no
more FitzÂ«immons money. About these
odds seemed to hold all the way across the
continent. At Salt Lake, where I stopped
off, 100 to 7o was offered. Those, I think,
are about the ri^ht odds. As for myseif, i
am doing no betiing on the tight, nor am

"I went through Reno at 9 o'clock this
morning without stopping off. I came on
here just for a 1 ittle pleasure trin ; to take

The last time Al Smith was out here was
in ISB4, when he brought John L. Sullivan

FINDS A HOME lit FRESNO.
Chanty Bes owtd Upon a Young Woman
on Whom Fortune Has '
Frowned. â 
, FRESNO. Cal., March B.â On the. Valley
railway train yesterday i here arrived in
this .city a young woman who says her
name is Clara Jen son, and that she is not
yet 22 years of age. She had walked from
Stockton "to . Lankershim. about thirty
miles north of here, where a kind-hearted
man bad given her money enough to pay
her fare to Fresno. ' - -, il .%
Tne history of the woman is a sad one
and an apt demonstration of the fact that
the way of the transgressor is hard. Miss
Jensen was seen cowering in a corner in
the depot after the arrival of the train
yesterday. She acted somewhat strangely
and the agent telephoned to the Sheriff's
office that an insane woman was making
him feel uncomfortable by her presence
at the depot.
Two officers responded to the call and
took the woman in charge. They found
when they spoke to her that she was not
wrong mentally.
In response to their questions she said
she had come from San Francisco, and
that she was penniless and did not know
where to go.
The Deputy Sheriffs instead of taking
the unfortunate woman to jail took her to
the Salvation Army barracks, where she
found friends. The latter are doing every
thing they can to help her.
Miss Jensen stated this afternoon that
seven years ago, when she was 15 years of
age, aho ran away from her parents, whose
home is in Fort Worth, Tex.
She was led into this foolish act by a
man who brought her to San Francisco
and deserted her about a year afterward.
Since then she worked as a domestic,
earning her own living. Then a cancerous
sore broke out on her ankle and she spent
all the money she could get for treatment.
Becoming unable to work longer she
set out to walk to Fort Worth to return to
her parents in Texas. She started
only with W cents, and with this she took
theboat t6 Stockton, whence she walked
to Lankershim. She traveled on loot about
four weeks, going without iood for the first
five days. Then she made appeals at
ranch houses. She endured untold priva
tions. To-day, with the assistance of the
Salvationists, Miss Jensen wrote a letter
to her parents, who have never heard of
her since she left them.

ern Oregon ranges, where animals are per
ishing by hundreds and even thousands
this winter.
Roaming over the ranges ol the moun
tain slopes are numberless bands of
horses that are dying through starvation
and exposure. The winter is unusually
severe in the mountains, and even cattle
which are taken care ol have suffered
some. The ranges Â«re barren and it
passes the memory of the settlers when
the conditions were such as tney now are.
Whole herds of horses are seen along
the stage road. The iamished beasts have
gnawed each other's tails and manes off.
They are so weak that they can scarcely
more than walk. Frequently a half-dozen'
horses will be found frozen in a snow
bank, where they have stumbled and
stuck fast and are unable to get out.

NOT YET FELONS
Chalmers' An ti- Newspaper
Bill Killed in the
Council.
Was Introduced Because Claims
for Printing Had Been
Presented.
Territorial Lawmakers Refuse to Pay
the Publishers for Tbeir
Work
PHCENIX, Ariz., March B.â Speaker
Chalmers' anii-.iewspaper bill, which
passed the Assembly on Saturday, has
been killed in the upper house of '.he
Legislature. It was laid on the table and
is not likely to receive a hearing at this
session. Thus perishes one of the most
unique measures ever passed by a legis
lative body in this civilized age.
The introduction of this bill by Speaker
Chalmers was the culmination of a fight
between the ultra-economists and thoÃe
disposed to be at least fair toward the
newspapers of the Territory. Chalmers'
bill made it a felony to publish or edit a
newspaper within the Territory, pre
scribed from ten to twenty years' impris
onment for the crime, and r yoked the
Governor's power to pardon in such cases.
Chalmers is a clever satirist, and intro
duced the bill apparently in pooi faith.
The House caught the spirit of the joke,
suspended the rules, pushed the bill to
second reading and thon to final passage,
the measure going through by a good ma
jority. A half-hour later several econom
ical Solon* were on their feet explaining
that they had nothing against newspapers
and had never done anything in all their
lives to offend them. This, however, was
following very closely upon the heels of .a
vote to kill all the newspaper claims in
the general deliciency billâ a vote that
came at the end of a long debate and sev
eral secret sessions.
Some of the newspapers had claims in
for printing reports and many of them
claimed modest sums for furnishing
copies to the last Legislature. All of
these claims had been stricken out and
some bitterness was thereby engendered.
It has been the ;ustoni since the earliest
days for the Legislature to return the
courtesy of the newspapers in supplying
free copies by voting them a nomina.
sum. Those who opposed the precedent
are also tne ones who voted lor bi.; items
of a questionable character.
Capitol Jiuilainr fmr Phoenix.
PHCENIX, Akiz, March B.â Governor
Franklin to-day bigned t!ie bill passed by
the Legislature authorizing the issuance
of $100,000 of 5 per cent bonds to build a
capitol building in Pboenix, and there is
great rejoicing in toe city. Heretofore
the Territory has rented apartments in
the City Hail for its officers and the leg
islature. A site containing ten acres was
donated by Genera: M. E. Collins several
years ago, but the United States Govern
ment would not build a house for ihe Ter
ritory. This measure will have to be ap
proved by Congress before the bonds can
be issued.

PHCENIX, Ariz., March B.â The legis

IT STANDS THE TEST.
Among the Mass of Unworthy Prepara

eminent.
It Is a we.l-known fact that a large per- 9
centageuof whiskies upon the market and .
in use to-day are simply cheap adultera
tions. They may be called "straight
goods," "blends," or any other name that
an unscrupulous manufacturer or dealer
chooses, but the fact remains that they
are simply concoctions and adulterations
which are injurious to any one who uses
them.
In the midst of this mass of unhealthful
whiskies there stands one bright excep
tion. . It has stood out clearly before the
public for twenty years. Its purity, is
guaranteed by the best physicians in the
land, and it has done more to preserve
health than all the other whiskies com
bined. It is Duffy's pure malt whiskey.
It has a reputation established by twenty
years of us*, and it has that reputation to
sustain; It is always uniiorm in quality,
every bottle is precisely alike. Its very
purity rentiers it valuable, but it possesses
in . addition y thereto medicinal qualities
known to no other whiskey. You make
no mistaKe in buying Duffy's pure malt,
but you make an egregious error if you
allow any unscrupulous dealer (or a mo
ment to argue with you that any one of
the cheap adulterated whiskies, that are
on the market is as good as Duffy's. It is
false. â¢ â  â  '

Los Angeles Workingmen
Need No Longer Be
Idle.
Given a Chance to Earn Enough
to Replenish Empty
Larders.
Labor on Park Improvements for a
Remuneration of a Dollar
a Day.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March B.â One
hundred bright silver dollars were dropped
Into the pockets of an equal number of
laborers at Llysian Park this eveninc.
The recipients had worked faithfully all
day on a roadway in the park. They
were the first to be employed from the
army of idle men now in this city.
The coin received is from the fund
raised for the purpose by the Merchants'
and Manuiacturers' Association. Ar
rangements have been made to pay theae
laborers at the close of each day's work.
The men pat at work to-day are bona
â  tide residents of this city, and most of
A :hem have families. To-morrow the force
A ill be increased to 200 and the day after
to 300, and so on until every man here who
wants to work at $1 a day need not be idle.
Nearly all of those who answered the
call went to the scene of their Jabors on
foot. It was a long walk for many of
them, but they did not grumble. The
opportunity to earn $1 a day was a suf
ficient incentive to dvi them into a cheer
ful frame of mind. When they reached
their destination there were no tools in
sihgt, so the gang had to wait until the
arrival of Charle9 Wilae with the supply
of shovels and picks. The plan of tne un
dertaking had been laid out by the en- '
gineers and surveyors and the stakes were
all in place, showing the (me of road, so
there was but little delay when the "im
plements of warfare" were delivered.
When everything was in readiness the
dirt. began to fly.
CRAZED BY UNREQUITED LOVE.
Sad Story of a Fohsk Nobleman's Daugh
ter Whose Affections Were
Bes owed Unwisely.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March B.â A sad
hearted, careworn aud almost distracted
lutle woman ieft this city to-night for tbe
r-cene of a former hanp}' home in Cincin
nati, Ohio. She is Ottolio Burkowsky, a
woman of the Polish nobility, who was
discarded by her relatives because of an
infatuation for Harry Schoonmaker, a
iormer resident of Cincinnati. She ia
said to have passed a 1? Schoonmaker's
wife for many year*, during which time
she filled the position of chief modiste in
a big dry-coods establishment.
Two years aeo s:ie came to Los Angeles
to join the object of her affections. She
found Scnoon maker with another woman.
An erpObUre followed and the rival would
nave nuihine more to tlo with him. Miss
Burkowsky then endeavored to get I
Schoonmaker to return to her, but in
stead he married Miss Elsie Bierlicb, a
handsome 'ceilo-player, well known
throughout Southern California.
Miss Burkowsky bad advanced large
sums of money for Schoonmaker to in
vest. He lost this money, it is said,
in unfortunate ventures. This, with the
losa of his affections, caused Miss Bur
kawsky to almost lose her mind. She
â¢wrote vile and threatening letters to Mrs.
Schoonmaker, and in consequence was ar
rested for making threats against life.
To-day Miss Burkowsky was given until
"Wednesday to file a peace bond of $2000
and made to swear that she would not
molest Schoonmaker'e wife. This order,
it is said, was made to give her a chance
t j leave town, as it is believed that she is
partially demented. Prominent society
reople interested themselves in her behalf
and gave her an opportunity to get away.
EXTERMINATING THE SEAL
Few Animals Left in the Herds That Fre

Channel.
- LOS ANGELES, Cal., March B.âAc
cording to authentic reports from Santa
Baibara if Uncle Sam wants to protect
t!.c s*"als of his own coast he hart better
turn his attention to tbe Santa Barbara
Channel, where during the past few weeks
probably 3000 of t."iese valuable animals
have been killed. Previous to this season
the seaiers have never considered these
near-by waters as worth their considera
tion, but wben the Louisa D visited them
nbout two months apo, and the news o;
her success was learned, she was joined by
four or five other vessels and sad havoc has
revolted.
Except for the killing of a few specimens
for museums, these seal rookeries have
never heretofore been molested. There is
but a limited stretch of coast that the
kseals frequent in any numbers, and the
â¢..unting of the nast winter has diminished
w.i am sadly. The sealers, having practic
, "iily exterminaied the herd, are preparing
to put to sea. The return of a larger fleet
in another year may be expected.

NOT A FUNGOUS GROWTH.
An Expert Accounts lor a Peculiar Dis
co/oration in Certain
Oranges.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March B.âPo
mona and Ontario orange-crowers have
promulgated a new theory regarding the
so-called fungous growth whici: has been
seen on oranges and lemons occasionally
and regarding which the San Francisco
Examiner started an aDortive sensation.
Few people had paid any attention to the
growth until the papers called attention
to it, and then it was found to be a cer
tain marking on fruit which had been
known for years, but which had never
done anything more serious than to con
demn a few oranges and lemons to the
cull pile.
Since the Examiner developed its sensa
tion, D. J. Coudry, an orange-buyer for
the Earl Fruit Company, who is one of
the best-informed men in this section re
garding oranges, has been giving con
siderable attention to the growth, and he
gives it 3s his opinion that it is not of a
fungous nature, but is due to the effects of
the gas used in the fumigation of trees.
He says that where there is an abrasion of
iheskinof the iruit the gas produces a
diacqloration, and that is ail tnero is to
the fungous growth sensation. He can find
the peculiar markings on the fruit no
where but in orchards where the trees
have been ihoroughiy fumigated, and
there the percentage of the fruit stowing
the so-called lungus is very small, and the
markings indicated an abrasion before the
discoloration took place.
RIOTING CCEUR D'ALENE MINERS.
Trouble Between Catholics and American
Protective Association Members
Renewed.
SPOKANE, Wash., March B.â The re
ligious war that has been waged between
miners in the Cceur d'Alene for years past
was given a fresh impetus yesterday by
an occurreVce that threatens to lead to
the shedding of blood. At a recent enter
tainment at Wardner, Miss Johnson, a
schoolteacher, in an address made an at
tack on Catholic?. In last week's issue of
the Wardner Citizen Editor C. K. Bums,
commenting on her utterances, made
some severe strictures upon Miss John
son's personal character.
American Protective Association mem
bers to the number of 150 met yesterday
and a committee of five was appointed to
bring Burris before the meeting. He was
dragged from his office through the streets
to the place of meeting. A stormy dis
cussion ensued as to what to do with
Burris. Some favored a coat of tar and
feathers, but the majority wanted to hang
him. Finally, after a strong appeal from
the leader of the secret organization to
not commit murder, a motion to run
Burris out of town prevailed. He was es
corted from the place by a mob.
Late to-day warrants were issued for
the arrest of eight ringleaders on a charge
of conspiracy and inciting riot. Sheriff
Henri and five deputies have started to
the mines to make arrests. Grave appre
hension is felt at Wardner as to the out
come of the trouble, as the feeling runs
high. _
SAUBALITWS PKCVUAK CASE.
Xovtl JDef&nte Put forward by a Man
Charged. With Crime.
SAUSALITO, C*x.,~* March B.â There
was quite a collection of animals in the
Recorder's court in Sausalito to-day dur
ing the progress of the case of the people
against J. Christensen, charged with ap
plying vulgar language to Mrs. Lucy
Souza.
A novel defense was offered when Chris
tensen, who held a large gunnysack in his
hand, and said that the vulgar term which
he used was the name of the black cat he
had in the bag. His Honor, Judge Pryor,
drew back in horror when Christensen
offered 10 produce the animal, and two
dogs lying on the floor ieft the courtroom
in disgust at having been cheated out of a
scrap.
Christensen is also accused of spitting
at Mrs. Souza's feet.
Christensen put his son and little daugh
ter on the witness-^tand to prove that the
vile name was that which the family regu
larly applied to â  the cat. Judge Pryor
failed to see the matter in that light and
Christensen was found guilty, with orders
to appear for sentence to-morrow at 10
o'clock.

horse Salvable going into the starter's
hands a9to 10 choice. Cash Day was con
sidered the contending horse and was
heavily backed at twos and Bto 5. It was
a one-hor-e race. H. Martin on the favor
ite was nllowed to make his own running
and the son of Sa! valor won easing up in
I:so}*. Cash Day beat Salvation several
lengths for the place. Lovdal never had a
chance.
Bookmaker Barney Schreiber's recent
purchase, Sweet William, was a 7 to 5 fa
vorite for the first event decided, a six
furlong Belling dash for three-year-olds,
and the mudlark laid all over the field,
winning in a common gallop from Alta
mai, the second choice. Siegfried, away
from the post poorly, finished in the show.
Another favorite finished in the two
year-old scramble at three and a half fur
longs. St. Philip, at 7 o 5 throuchout the
betting, led from the time the barrier flew
up, downing Jim Brownell with ease.
Swanhilda, a hot tip, backed from 100
down to 10, was a good third.
Charley Thorpe again showed to good
advantage in the mile and a furlone sell
ing affair that was next called. He had
the mount on Ezell's Morte Kons*, a 16 to
5 chance in the betting, and hooking up
with Perseus, ridden by Piggott, the last
furlong he got his mount past tne judges
half a length in front of Purser's gelding.
Can't Dance, backed from twosdown to 6to
5 favoritism, came from behind, fini v hisig
third. Doctor G made the running to the
stretch, where he fell back beaten.
The fifth race was over ti mile under
selling conditions with Atkin & Lottridge's
Double Quick ruling a ti to 5 favorite.
Collins. Kansorc, Frank Jaubert and
Judge Denny till came in for considerable
support. The first choice took the lead
after half the distance had been covered,
and although stopuing badly the last six
teenth was given the decision over Judge
Denny by a narrow margin. Collins ran a
remarkably good race, Being beaten but a
short head for tne place.
The presence of such fast ones as Sum
mertime, David and Midlight in the final
six-furl one sprint scared oat the greater
portion of the other entries?. The handi
cappers, almost to a unit, landed on Mid
light with 98 pounds up and Tod Sloan in
the saddle, backing the filly down from
8t05t04 to 5. Openinz at twos, Sum
mertime receded in the books until 5 to 1
was obtainable- Two to one was nearly
Iways obtainable against David. When
a ent away, Tnorpe on the latter at once
s ent his horse to the front, and by tne
s ime the stretch w*s reached lie had Mid
night short of ready breathing material.
iHe then went on and won cleverly from
Summertime, which bÂ°ut the tiring favor
ite for the place.

TO FILL A VACANCY.
Police Corporal Gleegon Will Likely
Succeed .Sergeant MeKenna.
At the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners to-morrow night the vacancy
caused by the death of Sergeant McKenna
will be tilled.
It is generally conceded that Corporal
Henry Gleeson will be promoted to fill the
vacancy. He has been for the past four
years the assistant to Sergeant McKenna,
and is therefore thoroughly familiar with
therequirementsof theoilice, besides beine
in pvery respect competent to perform the
duties.
When Property Clerk Cullen died a fow
months ago Sergeant Moran, wUo had been
his chief assistant, was promoted, and the
general belief is that ttie Commissioners
will follow the same rule in Gleeson's case.
AN UNHAPPY WIFE
TURNS ON THE GAS
Mrs. Genie Mann Deliber
ately Ends Her Own
Life.
Young, Comely, Desirous of
Gayety, She Had Left
Her Husband.
H> Is David Mann, a Respected Young
Clerk Living an! Employed
in 0 k and.
Ttfrs. Genie Mann, the young, rather
comely, but dissatisfied wife of David Mann
of Oakland, died yesterday about noon
time while being hurriedly conveyed irora
the private boarding-house at 216 Eddy
street, where she had a room, to t'.ie Re
ceiving Hospital.
She nad deliberately planned to commit
MRS, GENE MANN, Who Committed Suicide Yesterday*
suicide by closing her room and turning
on the gas, and she succeeded.
Letters left by her explain that she was
melancholy and did not care to prolong a
life which she considered a hard one for
her to endure.
Although but 23 year- of age at the time
of her death, she had been married sev
eral years, had experienced marital un
happineas, and during the last four
months had, after her return from the
East, taken up her residence in this City
entirely away and apart from her hus
band.
A servant in the Doarding-honse discov
ered the odor of gas issuing from Mrs.
Mann's room, to which the unhappy
woman had retired aÂ« usual the evening
before. An immediate investigation dis
closed the fact that the case was one for
prompt medical attention, and the patrol
wag n was hastily summoned, but she
died before the hospital was reached.
David Mann, the woman's husband, is
well known in Oakland, where ho has
been a resident for a number of years.
His domestic troubles have been known
to his friends for some time, and they
have looked upon him witu a good deal of
sympathy.
Mann is employed at Abraharason's dry
goods store, and his employers cive him
an exceptionally good name. He is said
to be industrious, steady and energetic,
and a valuable employe.
Mr. Mann married when his wife was
quite yoiini;, and for the first few years
their united l:fo was a very happy one.
Mrs. Mann was decidedly attractive and
some years ago became discontented.
She preferred company and the giddy
whirl of society to home life, and as her
husoand is of a domestic naiure they dis
agreed.
She began to receive attention from
others, and then there was an unpleasant
expose, and Mann sent her East to her
parents.
Mrs. Mann returned from thb East about
four months ago, bat she did not rejoin
her husband in Oakland. She came in
stead to San Francisco and Jed a gay life.
The following op n note, written in
pencil to the proprietress of the boarding
house, explained the situation to those
whodiecovered the body:
Dear Mis. Norton: When you find me this
morning j>k'n>u nave as iif.le fuss made as
possible. Dear friend, lam ab ut to do some

hard one and 1 can't bear it tiny longer.
There is no one to blame at nil. lam na'u

been more so than ever. 1 think I am half
crazy.
Piease telegraph to Mr. Minn right away.

Hich mines abounded there, to be sure,
but they were not for sale at any figure
that Emmons could reach, so he started
out to discover something of his own.
.His funds grew lower and lower and he
was about cleaned out, when one .day
while exploring a rocky, hillside he came
across a ledge that made his eyes glisten.
The rock seemÂ«d to fairly teem with gold
and be hastily located a claim.
By the time he had tiled his location his
cash, was almost gone and he was at a loss
to rind out how to get more. "- He feared to
let any one into the secret of his find, was
suspicious or the telegraph,- which he
i thought of using to get funds from home,
and finally decided to take bis specimens
home, sell his business and property and
fly back to the millions that awaited h!m.
"It was slow work reaching Port Costa
from far away Randsbun. but by dint of
walking a little, riding brnkebeams a little
and paying his passage when be could he
finally completed his journey and at once
made preparations to sell all.
. While an agent was seeking for a pur
chaser Emmons* thought he might as well
ascertain whether his roclc went $1000 or
$10,000 to the ton and came to this City.
Hunting up Thomas Price he closed the
door carefully and then triumphantly,
drew forth his specimens. , -
"Pretty rich rock, that," he remarked,
with much satisfaction, as he handed a
glittering chunk to Price.
The assayer took one look at the speci
men and then sent Emmons' heart into
bis boot? by saying: â¢ - â¢ ,â - . -*'V.^
"That is not real gold; It is fool's goldâ t
not worth a dollar a ton. Iron pyrites, we
call it." : .
-Kmmons waited for no more, but flew
for 'the Jerries and took the first train
home. Me reached thorp in time to save
his property from being sacrificed and has
once more settled down to the life of a

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
TUESDAY .".: MARCH 9, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
46 2. *3 inches
of advertisements, which is
224 inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
.Remember that to help the unempioyed
is to help the City.
Vicious jonrnalism is progressing rapidly
on the toboggan-slide.
A protective tariff will soon bring out
the money needed to make the mare go,
and after that progress will be rapid.
â \Vith a sufficient tariff to protect the
s\igar industry in this country California
would have a future with millions in it.
European diplomacy may yet have to
call in several armies to keep the peace,
It is evident the navies cannot do it alone.
Cali'ornia will have many interests at
stake dunnz the extra session of Congress
and now is the time to prepare to look
after them.
Once more they have had disastrous
blizzards in the East to remind us that
what we call storms out here are only
beneficial showers.
When a newspaper adopts the nature of
a serpent it will be treated like a serpent,
and every man will seek to crush it in the
dust where it crawls.
Let Europe attend to Crete. Our busi
ness is with Cuba. Until we have secured
the rights of patriots in America we ought
not to interfere elsewhere.
There has been no declaration of war in
Europe, but to the Greeks and the Turks
no declaration of intention is necessary.
They understand one another.
The silent Mr. Heitfelt of Idaho may
not get a seat in the United States Senate
after all. He seems to have paid too many
legislators to saw wood for him.
* â¢
Some of the Democratic organs have be
gun to attack the new tariff, although it
has not yet been drawn up. The habitual
kicker kicks because he cannot help it.
The Legislature will please take notice
that an appropriation for a California
display at the Hamburg Exposition will
not be an extravagance, but an economy,
and the people desire it.
Minister de Lome is another statesman
who wrote a book that gives more pleasure
to his enemies than his friends. As he
disapproved of some things in San Fran
cisco it goes without saying that he lacks
bo h judgment and veracity.
It is to be regretted that a mimber of
strikes havo been started in tbe Ea<=t just
at this juncture. The new administration
â will do much to revive prosperity, but
labor and capital must work together in
harmony in order to make it certain.
The Cuban mass-meeting will give the
people of San Francisco an opportunity to
show how thoroughly they share the sym
pathies of the rest of the country with tho
utrugrgSinir patriots of the island and Amer
ican citizens who are imprisoned there.
Massachusetts is raising $20,000 to erect
a monument to Genr>ral Warren, and Mis
touri is raising $1800 to erect one to Daniel
Boone. The difference in the amounts
sbow3 the difference of ideas in the two
Stales as to what constitutes a monument.
The work of the members of Carpenters'
Union No. 453 in building a home for a
fellow-member Is an example worth imi
tating. If the whole community were
actuated by an equal spirit of mutual
helpfulness San Francisco would bo the
most prosperous City in America.
The Mechanics' Library of this City, the
libraries oi .Portland, Or., nnd Newark, N.
J., have set the example of excluding
vicious journals from their reading-rooms,
and so great is the popular approval of the
action that it cannot bedoubted that other
libraries will soon adopt a similar course.
Decadent journalism is repulsive to Ameri
can ideas of decency and will not be tol
erated.
The action of tbe organization of the i
unemployed men in this City in opening
a bureau for t!:e purpose of providing
work for unemployed women is in every
respect commendable and merits the co- |
operation of all who have any means of
aiding the movement. This is not an
issue of charity, but of public expediency.
There should be work for all willing
workers and good waÂ»es at that.
Can a Governor appoint a Senator when
the Legislature refuses to elect one ? That
is the conundrum on the solution of which
lhe organization of the Senate depends.
If the appointments of the Governors of
Oregon and Kentucky a c valid the Senate
will have a Kepublican majority, but
otlierwjÂ»e the majority will be scattering
and the result will be confusion. The
Senate lias heretofore held that a Governor
could not appoint a Senator under such
circumstances, but this teems a pood occa
sion for revising the old rule and making
a better one.
THE CLIMAX OF IMPUDENCE.
The audacity, impudence and brazen shamelessness of the Examiner are now re
vealed to the public at the climax of their effrontery and at the lowest depths of their
cowardice. The proceedings at Bacrarnento exhibit the foul slanderers in their true
nature. Brought to bay on tneir charges against the Legislature of "Bribery in Aid
of Thievery," the whole Examiner gang gives evidence of nothing but cowardice in
aid of lying.
Confronted recently in Sacramento by an indignant man, Long Green Lawrence
submitted tamely in public to the accusations of being "a liar, a crook and a boodling
blackguard." Confronted by the Legislature, which he has foully libeled, Lawrence
by his own mouth confirms the truth of the accusations to which he tamely sub
mitted. He makes no manly effort to prove that he spoke the truth, nor shows any
sincerity or belief in his own utterances. His sole effort has been to get away from
the corner in which he has been caugnt. He has lied, he has evaded, he resorted to
trick after trick, but in vain. Long Green Lawrence at bay is even more contemptible
than Long Green Lawrence at large.
Its own foulness being fully exposed ths Examiner now seeks to defile others.
Haying no character to lose it shrieks lie after lie against the members of the Legis
lature in the hope of inducing them to turn with disgust from further prosecution of
the case. Brazen audacity, shameless impudence, lying effrontery are the masks
under which its cunning seeks to conceal its cowardice. All Ihese, however, will ba
useless. The Examiner and its managers are cornered, and they will not escape until
they have been branded as slanderers of the commonwealth and turned over to the
lash of public scorn.
NO SHUFFLING.
Like an abandoned thief in the dock, a branded slanderer in the
toils of the law, a whining miscreant exposed to the scorn and con
| tempt of honest men, the EXAMINER, inspired by the unspeak
! ably infamous Lawrence and deserted by the cowardly absentee
! Hearst, is making a desperate but futile effort at Sacramento to
evade the issue of bribery which itself raised.
This blackmail! g mongrel of decadent journalism made a direct,
specific, positive charge that "bribery" had b.en employed "in
| aid of thievery." Given the amplest opportunity to prove this
: grave and serious charge affecting alike the individual
l honor of the Legiilature and indirectly the reputation of
! California, the Examiner prates of "privileged communications,"
declines to furnish proof, and, adopting the despised methods of the
j b ackguard, now seeks to assassinate the men who indignantly asked
j for facts, not rumorâ truth, not lies.
Let there be no shuffling. Let the issue be met face to face. It is
hoped and believed that the Legislature will stand firm and reso
lutely assert its constitutional rights and power.
THE BEET -SUGAR INDUSTRY.
Among the interests California will have at stake in the new tariff none will be
greater than that of the sugar industry. The remarkable adaptability of our soil ana
climate to the production of tbe sutar beet is well known. Tiie yield in tons per acre
is immense, the per cent of saccharine contents of those grown here excends that of
any other known locality, and there are three-quarters of a trillion acres within the
limits of the State where the soil, water and climate have been tested as to their beet
growing powers and pronounced perfectly fit. This acreage, if fully utilized, would
produce one- fourth as much as the present entire world's beet sugar output and yield
a revenue of a hundred millions.
The magnitude of the opporhinity needs only to be investigated to be appreciated.
It needs only to be reached out for ntrenuously in order to bo realized. The abundant
profits of its culture have been proven. Concerted action to advance the industry
would add vastly to California's prosperity and, inasmuch as the special session of
Congress is so soon to meet to revise the tariff, now is the accepted time for aclon.
There are now about 22,000 acres in California devoted with gratifying results to
beet culture, but this is not quite a third of one per cent ol the vast area adapted to it.
The price paid averages about $4 per ton lor good beets, and with a protective tariff
there would be chances for even better prices.
Some of our beets have averaged 23.05 per cent of saccharine matter, which is a
world-surpassing record, and the average over the whole acreage is one ton of sugar to
seven tons of beets, while tbe average in Europe, with all the advantage of their long
experience in its culture, is one ton of sugar to seven and fifty-eight hundredths of
raw beets. The people of the United States consume annually 2 500,000 tons of sugar,
and for that part of it which comes from foreign nations we pay $120,000,000. Califor
nia is capable cf producing more than half of the amount of this enormous consump
tion and nearly the whole ot'the amount for which we send our gold abroad to buy.
California herself pays $6,000,000 annually to foreigners for sugar.
The great need is to induce capital to oome tc the farmers' aid in this matter. We
have all else. A proper plant is immensely costly and capital is proverbially timid.
Let the Government make our moneyed men sure that foreign nations are not to be
permitted to rush in with their bounty-cheapened sugar to make their large invest
ments in American factories profitless and then the last essential of succsss will soon
start this great industry toward the :ealization of all its splendid possibilities.
Read the great expose in Tlifl; CAI-Li to-morrow, "The
Hypocrite l~iini;i>k<-d."
VOLUNTEER WORKERS.
The publication in The Call yesterday
of a report of the action of the members
of Carpenters' Union No. 483 in building
a home for one of their fellow-members,
Louis Metter, is another of those illustra
tions of co-operation which ?how how use
ful to society is the fraternal fe:ling en
gendered among workiugmen by their
organized unions.
The publication of yesterday is not the
first time The Call has had to record the
construction of a home for some working
man in this City by the members of his
union. It is in fact no unusual thing for
workingmen to assist one another in that
way, and many instances cuuld be cited
where the homes of mechanics in this City
have been built without any cost to them
for labor. Over and over again the work
ingmen of San Francisco have shown that
they are actuated by a genuine spirit of
mutual helpfulness, and have set a good
example to wealthy citizens of how to ad
vance the welfare of a city by working
together for the general eood.
Such evidences of co-operation among
workingmen in San Francisco aie the
more notable because this is a compara
tively new city. The men who thus as
sist one another in the construction of
homes have come to San Francisco from
all parts of the Union, and possibly from
all parts of the world. They are not
bound together by ties of kinship or mar
ritge, nor have they been friends fr^m
childhood. Many of them are compara
tively strangers to one another. The only
cord which holds them together is tbe
bond of organized labor, and tbe work
they do is, therefore, conclusive proof of
the value of such organizations to work
ingmen and to the community at large.
That which is given by these volunteer
workers to their fellow-members of a
trades union is worth more than the
money value of a day's labor. It counts
for more than the actual labor performed
because it is a'i evidence of friendship
and an expression of resolute determina
tion to advance the welfare not only of
the man who receives the direct benefit of
the work, but of all workingmen who
bave sufficient interest in the cause of
labor to join the unions and take part in
the battle for tbe upbuilding of the wel
fare of industry.
The Call is always well ploased tore
cord sued events. The work done on tha
home of Louis; Metter sets a good exam pie
to the wealth of the City. We are now
engaged in the task of providing work
and wages for the unemployed men and
women of San Francisco. If the citizens
generally had anything like the generous
spirit which prompted tne carpenters of
Union No. 483 that employment would be
given instantly. It would require no
solicitation or urging to obtain the funds
necessary to give every willing worker the
employment he needs. The example set
by the carpenters should not be lew on
the community. Let us all act together
with a like spirit of mutual helpfulness,
and San Francisco will soon become the
most prosperous community in America.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1897.
AN EMERGENCY BILL
A bill has been introduced before the
Legislature and made a special order for
this evening, naving lor its object a reduc
tion in the cost ot holding freeholders', or
charter, elections. It provides for such a
grouping of election precincts at the
time of a charter election as would
do away with a vory material amount
of the expense incident to such
an election. The measure, although
general in terms, evidently applies in a
special sense to the City and County of
San Francisco and would benefit it in a
most material way, in view of the pros
pect of another charter election. The act
is an emergency measure, and having
been introduced too late in the session to
be entitled to passasje without a joint
resolution of the Senate and Assembly
permitting it, should receive the impetus
of such a resolution.
It is a patent fact that San Francisco
needs a new organic law. It is equally
clear that every unnecessary expense of
another charter election should be avoided
to the end that the people may have an
opportunity to vote upon another charter
relieved of the objections whmh defeated
the one most recently proposed and at a
slight expense in the way of taxation.
The S ate at large is not materially inter
ested in this measure, but the City of Ban
Francisco and those who bear the burden
of its taxes are. Tne bill whicti has been
introduced has been officially approved by
the Merchants' Association of this City
and will doubtless meet with tie univer
sal support of its citizens. It should re
quire no further argument to induce the
Legislature to pass the joint resolution
essential to the success oi this measure
and to give it the preference accorded to
emergency bills. It is to be hoped that
it wili receive favorable consideration at
the hands of the Legislature to-night.
THE HAMBURG EXHIBIT.
An appropriation for the purpose of
making a California exhibit at the Ham
burg Exposition is one which the Legisla
ture could well afford to make without
laying itself open to the charge of ex
travagance. It. would provide a means
for opening a new market for California
fruit, woods and minerals, and therefore
would be of benefit to the people of every
section of the State.
Hamburg is one of the largest centers of
European trade. It is the irate through
which access is gained to Germany and
all Northern Europe. There is a consid
erable demand there for fruits and for fine
woods US' ful for artistic purposes, and we
hardly need more than an opportunity to
show our products of that kind in order to
occasion a demand for them which would
be profitable to our producers.
The advantage cl such an exposition is
recognized by the leaders of industrial
and commercial enterprises in this State,
and they have given a cordial approval to
the bill lor the proposed appropriation,
There can be no question of their fitness
to judge of its possible value to the State,
and their recommendations deserve the
careful consideration ol the members of
the Legis ature.
Taken in connection with the proposed
exhibit at Guatemala the one at Hamburg
would round out a complete display of
California products in the places where
such displays would be most beneficial.
It would be useless to show our fruit and
fine woods in Guatemala and equally use
less to display our machinery and manu
factured products at Hamburg. A display
of mechanical industry at Guatemala,
however, and a fruit display at Hamburg
could hardly fail to widely extend our
markets for both classes of our products.
In each case the display would be made
in a place where there is a promising mar
ket for it, and we ought to have both in
order that all industries may have an
equal advantaee.

THE "CALL" SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest
Notab'e Thinkers.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: I have just laid down the March number of the Arena, after
reading the papers by Professor Joseph Le Conte, John Clark Ridpath, Pro essor Frank Parsons
and others, impressed with an Imperative sense of duy to speÂ»k an earnest word to the lar-'e
number of our most Intelligent men and women who I am sorrowfully certain seldom if ever see
this great magÂ«zine, no one of whom should fail to rend Professor Le Conte's paper on the moot
question of our time, here bearing the title, "The Relation of Biology to Phi osophv." which
he says is "the key to whatever is distinctive in my own views." or the raper by John Clark
Ridpatb, the profoundest living historian, on "Democracyâ lts Origins and Prospects," to say
nothing of such contribution? as those of Professor Parsons on "Compulsory Arbitration."
and Mayor Qulncy's on the "Development of American Cities," and a dozen others of moving
interest in this single number of tho Arena.
For the alert minds of our dny, such as find satisfaction only In the new primary thoueht
of the time, not in the echo of the former thinkers who have left their impress upon the world,
Profess >r Le Conte has a word to say which to me comes with the Inspiration of the latest and
most profound religions truth given to men. But it is given for those who have learned to
think, though in time it will paÂ«s into the speech and into the hearts ol the people. I cannot
undertake to review the eighieen pages here. I might as well try to review the multiplication
table, In one sense, so logically and compactly is the subject presented. True, I could say
"seven times seven are forty-nine," and therein give the law of the whole table. So I may
transcribe a sentence or two, which will indicate the whole purport of this latest revelation.
He sees that "evolution in a vague form has beon held by philos vphicat thinkers from the
earliest dawn of thought." and he identifies it with all the revelations and intimations of "tho
all-embracintr and ali-righteous wi'l of God."
"Why? Whence? Whither?" find fundamental answers in this brief paper of eighteen
Arena pages. Le Conte leads the religious thought ana molds the philosophy of this last
decade of the nineteenth century, and the spirit which animates him in all his work may well
be expressed in these noble words of Rev. William Rnder: "I regard a true belief In God as
the best corrective of superstition, and the first thing every child should be taught is a true
estimate of the Supreme Eeing." Read Le Conte. The light that led him astrny from the
mechanical theory ot Pnley was light from heaven. I shall be satisfied if I awake in the here
after wnore Le Conte feels at home.
In "Democracyâ lts Origins and Prospects," John Clark Ridpath touches another side of
life with all the profound s ; *rnifscance of Le Conte and all the sympathy of Lincoln. ThÂ°
ordinary reader can follow Ridpath with ease and delight, though the tremendous s^eep of
his deductions and the all-comprehending grasp of his generalizations will startle any reader
unaccustomed to his marvelous mastery of humnn history. No thoughtful man in any broad
sense an American can read this single shon paper by Ridnath, filling but fifteen Arena pages,
and not feel himself somewhat more a man and much more a patriot. The responsive heart
thrills over his glowing periods, and he grows stronger in the thoneht of being an American
citizen on the threshold of the twentieth century with the possibilities near at hand to be
made concrete realities by that mightiest agency at work among menâ a democratic patriotism
based on the rights of man.
Ridpath traces the democracy of man, not that of a party, to three sources, the gentle
Nazarene, the great Greek of ancient Hellas and the Teutonic barbarian of Northern Europe,
nnd finds in it a threefold development. True, antedating all these, in the far valley of the
Indies the followers of Guatama held human fraternity to be tho law of life. The Nazarene
teacher "tolerated the political order established by Rome in his native country, <but he passed
it by as something in which he found no interest or delight. He told his hearers to pay their
Irxps and say nothing. As to secular eovernment and its methods he said neither yea nor nay.
The institutions of society he virtually Ignored. The keynote of all he said and tÃught in nis
random ministry was the brotherhood and equality of men."
Of Greek democracy Ridpath tell* us that it antedated by several centuries the Asian re
former of Palestine. "The sons of Hellen, as we first discover them in the -Esean Islands ana
on the coast of lonld, were equalizers and levelers; they leveled upward" In ancient Hellas
"rose and reigned the most intellectual race of men that ever inhabited the world, the most
artistic and literary race," a "peoplo whose language nnd arts and learning was borne north,
south, east ana west, touching we might say all the existing institutions of mankind" to
enliven and glorify. But the essential element of Greek democracy was political or institu
tional. On the other hand Teutonic democracy was mainly social. "The theory of tribal
organization among the ancient Gsrmans was democratic In the extreme. The chiefcain was
never more than a leader of equals."
But I f orbear. I cannot summarize Ridpath. lie must be read line by line. Read this
paper on democracy. It will show you wherein "the Rtory of democracy In its issuance from
its threefold source down to its present aspect and condition among the nations, truly and
pathetically told, would surpass the Iliad and all other epics of race-life and human tragedy."
It will open an outlook it were well to con template. It goes to the heart of present conditions.
It is a good thing for us all to see that "it must neÂ°ds be that the advocates of despotism
should suffT fear; that every evil thing in the world is now afraid a~d that every good thing
in the world hts cournge." The reader will also discover that Dr. Ridpath is the editor of this
Arena Magazine, assiÂ«to<l oy Helen H. Gardener, the peerless woman thinker, and he will one
day thank me for writing this 'etter. JOSEPH ASBURY JOHNSON.

The Squirming Faker.
It is amusing to see the Examiner trying to squirm through a very small hole.
The public understand what it means, after faking to get up a small sensation or a big
â¢â¢scoop," as they wou'.d call it.
It is absurd to think that Superintendent Jfiynes can bÂ» compelled *o look through a pile of
100.000 or 200,000 telegrams to pick out those called for. if any are there. In other words,
they are fishing and only fighting for delay, ns the Examiner well knows that it would con
sume several weeks to accomplish what they have asked for. The Examiner has made a bold
and dtsiardly criminal charge. The proprietor of that paper should be made to tell where he
got the information to make this wholesale charge of bribery or pay the penalty of his
criminal act.
The best evidence that the whole thing is an Examiner fake is that no man would be fool
enough to expose himself through a teleeram if he intended such a thing.
Telesraros under the law are as sacred as a sealed letter and the manager of a telegraph
company cannot be compelled to produce them unless there is sworn evidence that these
messages were used for a criminal purpose, and then it must be stated who sent and received
them.
It looks to me at though if there has been any bribery done in the case it ha* been done
by the Examiner, which has evidently bribed a telegraph employe, for which they are crim
inally liable as well as the employe for exposing the contents of any message passing over the
teleeraph line.
The Examiner has boldly charged the members of the Legislature with bribery. Let that
paper produce the testimony or suffer the penalty.
I have no interest in this matter one way or the other than that I wonld like to see this
lying sheet squelcher!. The course of the Examiner has been to drive capital from the
State by advocating strikes and stirring up discontent between employer and employe, so that
people who have money are afraid to invest it in nny kind of manufacturing Dusiness that
requires skilled or unskilled labor. Capitalists do not dare to invest money in any kind of a
"corporation," no matter how many men this corporation should employ, for they well know
that the business would not get well under way before this boodle sheet would make a raid
uron the company and charge it with oppression of laDor. This is a well-known fact, and
there will be but little increase in manufacturing upon this coast while such a state of affairs
exists. A WAGE-WORKER.

Help the Idle to Find Employment.
To the Editor of the San Francisco fallâ Sir: Worklngmen, and especially those out of em
ployment, ought to be grateful to The Call for allowing the use of its columns for intelligent
discussion tending to the solution of the surplus labor problem. In The Call of March 5 Mr.
Orr suggests that some arrangement should be made whereoy idle men could rench placer
mines in different parts of the State, and there for a time malic a living, at least. This seems
very feasible, ar.d if the suggestion were acted upon, with the assisiance of the Mining Bureau,
wonld result in something really practical. Of course all of the unemployed could not, or
would not. leave the City, but men of push and independent character wouid, and these are
the men who ure deserving of assistance.
In yes'erday's Call "Patrick McGinnfs" asks why so many married men are out of em
ployment, us married men are usually preferred to single men when work is to be given out
thereby encouraging improvident marriages and tending still more to overcrowd tne labor
market. He th nks this is all wrone, a:id that employment should be provided only for
'â¢provident single men like myself, a rus;y, crusty, old bachelor." Whether he intends to be
taken seriously or not, there is nevertheless some truth In what he says. Naturally, sym
pathy will go toward a married man who has a family to support, and the single
man, even wh^n sober and industrious, must st-ind aside. A well-known
essayist says we live In a time when and under conditions where the law of the survival of
the fittest can scarcely be said to be In operation, but rather the ron-survival of the fittest He
barks up his assertion by the number of thoughtless and improvident people -who get mar
red, regirlleÂ« of the future either aÂ« to the likelihood of their making a c mfortable living o
of the physical or mental condition of the children they may Drlng into the world. This
class, it is claimed, survives, crowding out men and women the transmission of whose good
qualities wonld benefit the race.
I trust The Call will continue its activity in helping to devise means whereby so many
Idle men in our City may find employment. a Trades Unionist

THE MONARCH SLANDERED.
Stockton Independent.
To those who read of the legislative invest!
tion into the Examiner's charges of bribery in
pussing the bill for the disqualification of the
judges It is plain that the "new" journal is
doing its utmost to obstruct the work. While
boidly professing its ability to prove what it
charges, it doeÃ everything possible to prevent
the giving of evidence thai will reveal any
thing, even to withholding leave to its em
ployes to testify as they were required 10 do.
This is not the course that would be pur
sued by a paper having the evidence
it pretends to possess. Its charges were
made bolu.y, but the evidence on whijh
t l'cy rest appears to be as vague as
that of Polly Gray In the old song
of Jack Robinson. When reproached by Jack
for faithlessness she answered, "Somebody
said that somebody read in some newspaper
as how you was dead," whereupon Polly mar
ried. No one has been produced to assume
the responsibility for the charges, and on the
vague assertions of some pers >nB who are 100
cowardly to come forward and reiterate them
the Examiner's correspondent charged dis
tinctly that money had been paid for the
passage cf the bill and that paper indorsed
the charge in editorial articles. Now when it
is given an opportunity to do what it boasted
it could do it employs attorneys to aid it in
avoiding the necessity that the legislative in
vestigation imposed upon it. Tak-ju i i con
nection with its charges and its boasts the
course of the Examiner is both, cowardly and
dishonest.

THE NEW JOURNALISM.
Portland Oregonian.
The new journalism is In trouble ail around
Two or three of its professors are In jail or on
the wny there foi sending indecent matter
through the mails. Several of its most con
spcuous examples have been excluded from
public libraries as unfit for general reading
These papers always have been excluded from
the houses of refined and cultured men. It is
a^ fact of common knowledge that the New
Yorkers one meets in deceui society know no
more of the Journal than they do of "Little
Â£gypt," and that Californians traveling with
credentials that admit them to the company
of gentlemen make haste to declare that they
neither subscribe for nor read the Examiner
This sentimen t is spreading so fast that many
persons who see nothing objectionable in these
papers themselves are beginning to drop
mem out of deference to the judement of their
betters-Jor business reasons, if for no higher
motive. One of the most responsible journa s
of N^w York lately declared with all delibera
tion of a particularly dastard. y|and brutal per
formance of the Journal that no jury would
punish a male relative of the young woman
outraged for killing the editor.
Pursued by the law, rejected by the best pub
lig opinion, to which in the long run all pub
lic opinion tends to conform, and menaced
openly with the punishment of lyuch law, the
daily papers which outre.ge decency and in
vade the most sacred p ivate rights are al
ready In presence of an impending doom. The
movement of whicti these tilings are symptoms
has just begun. The Federal power is slow to
move in new channels, but it is untiring and
relentless when it has started. Ail the black

PATRIOT GREEKS ARE TRAINING
NIGHTLY TO FAKE THE FIELD
Fifty Men Who Served in the Army Are Ready to
Leave San Francisco for Crete at a
Moment's Notice.
WILL FIGHT FOR MOTHER
COUNTRY.
They Are Regu'arly Drilled by
an Ex-Grecian Artillery
O.ficer.
GREEK RESTAURANTS ARE DE
SERTED BY THE HELP.
The Young Men Have Ri lied to the
Standard and Are Anxious
to Fight.
Peter Carvoones, Demetrius Zervas,
I Demosthenes Capilos Peter Varellas and
a ualf dozen others are watching the trou
ble in Crete with doable interest. They,
with fifty companions who havo "seen
service," are ready at a moment's notice
to leava for the mother country, and
every one of them is a trained soldier.
They served their time in tne army, and
while nearly every one of them is an
American citizen they still consider them
selves in duty bound to obey the call to
arms issued by the Hellenic Government.
Fifty of them drill every night in a hall
on East street, and the leaders assert that
I all and sundry are ready to pay their own
| way to Athens at a moment's notice an!
! will not demand one cent from the Gre
: cian Government in the way of remunera
, tion.
Demetrius Zervas who is one of the
leaders of the small band of fifty, was a
I sergeant of arti.lery in the Grecian army
j a year ago. He fought in the last war on
I the frontier, and has time and again
â¢croÂ«sed swords with the Turks.
If. D. Vainvales, another member of the
company, was a sergeant of infantry, and
he al-o knows considerable about war in
the Orient. With the^e two men as drill
masters, the company is making rapid
progress, and should they sail for Crete it
wili be one of the best disciplined bodies
of men that has left California in years.
Yesterday the restaurants on the steam
ers San Rafael and Sausalito and the
Union Restaurant on East street were de
ser:ed by the cooks and waiters. Ail the
hands were anxious to find out what was
going on, and every one of them is more
than anxious to get a chance to reach
Athens and join in the h" ht against Tur
key. Their sudden departure made things
very awkward on the steamers and in the
restaurants, but the proprietors rut up
with the trouble and freely iorgave the
boys on account of the national feeling.
'â¢"We are all sympathy for the mother
country," said M. D. Vamvalesye.tcrday.
"Still nearly every one of us Das a little
business of his own here, and we will not
make a move until we know that war is
actually inevitable. Then you will find
every one of us ready to sacrifice every
thing in order to go to the front.
"All the Greeks who were born in 1866
and from that up to 1574 are liable for
service in the army, and every one of
them will obey the call. Nearly all of us
are American citizens, but when our duty
doe-Â» not keep us tied to our adopted
country, why then we will go back to our
first home nnd light for our fathers and
mothers, sisters and brothers and rela
tives."
Peter Carvoones is really head a,nd front
of the present movement, and he will be
captain of the compnnv that will leave
San Francisco for New York in a few days
if called upon. "We don't want any
money from the Greek Consul," said he
yesterday. "Every one of us will pay his
own way, and those who have no money
will work their passage. Our first duty is
to the United States, and we will do noth
ing tnat will bring our adopted country
into disrepute. Should Uncle Sam get into
trouble with a foreign power we would
stay at home and fight for Uncle Sam,
even if Ins arms were turned against
Greece. But now, when all Europe is
try.ng to coerce King George and our
relatives are in danger and our Govern
ment does not require our assistance,
.then, I think, it is time for us to get in
and show our colors.
"We are fifty strong, and the force can
be increa-ed to a Hundred at any time.
The leaders are all Spartans, and de
scendants of the 300 who, under the lead
ership of Leonidaf, defeated the Persian
hosts at The pass of Tnerniopyire. Every
one of our little band is ready to fieht at a
moment's notice,, and we will start for
New York the moment war is declared.
We have all quit work, and are now ready
for the call to arms."
Constantine Capilos is acting the part
of the heavy father to all "the boys"
who are so anxious to fight the Turk.
"There are about thirty-five of them in
California who are liable to be called to
arms," said he, when talking about the
matter. "They are from 21 to 31 years of
age, Â«nd would come under what you
would call the first draft. They would not
go alone, however, as every Greek in the
community that can carry a musket is
more than anxious to fire a shot in de
fense of the old tiae.
"I am more than surprised with the
sentiment among my American friends.
Every one of them ii in sympathy with
Greece, and I honestly think that if a
ban<J of Greeks started from here to-mor
row there would be twice as many Ameri
cans ready to cast in their lot in the ven
ture."
Ail thÂ« young Spartans go to Capilos for
advic-, and not one of them will make a
move unless he says so. In the mean
time, however, nearly every Greek restau
rant and business house in the City is tied
up, as the employes are on ihe warpatn.
and they have packed their valises und
are ready at a moment's notice to start for
Athens.
Ihe usual drill took place last night,
and tho full force of the company was
present. Sergeant Zervas put tlie men
ihroup-u the usual exercises, and in their
Greek uniiorms they made a very pretty
picture. "I have only been about a year
in California, but just the same I consider
this ray home," said he. "The United
States has no use for our arms; so mother
country calls us and we will go. I was
sergeant of artillery on the frontier under
General P. Ooloicotronl*. who is now the
head of the artilieiy division of the army,
and und>T him I first smelt powder. He
is a fighter and no mistake, and I am just
achun: to jret back to fight under his lead
erflnp again."
Peter Varellas ha* been away from
Sparta a little over six years. '*I love
America," said he yesterday, "and my
first duty is to my adopted country. But
then America floes not want my assist
ance and my father, mother, sisters and
brothers are in Greece, and iheydo want
my help. We are organized and ready to
leave at a moment's notice and every one
of our little band of fifty will pay his own
way."
Every night the Greeks drill in their
ball on East street and every night the

war spirit grows. They are conservative,
but nevertheless the slightest provocation
will see an exodus of armed men from San
Francisco bound for Crete.
WILLING TO COMPROMISE.
City Attorney CrrsWfll Thinks Buck
ingham & Hecht Would Win Their
Suit Against the City.
City Attorney Creswell has filed an
opinion advising the payment of a claim
against the City in favor of Buckingham
<fe Hecht, who two years a^o filed a suit to
recover $9756 31 for damages resulting
from an aliened improper construction of
a 3x5 orick sewer on Twenty-fourth street,
from Castro to Sanch-z, and the failure to
keep the same in repair, by reason of
which during a heavy rain on December
7, 1894, a great body of water was dis
charged upon the land and premises occu
pied by the plaintiff in tiie manufacture of
boots and shoes, thereby destroying and
injuring valuable property of the plaintiff
and its as-iirnors in the sum oi $'J756 31.
A communication was on February 22
last forwarded to the Board of Supervisors
by the plaintiff's attorneys asicing permis
sion to appear before the board wi-h
vouchers and proof of the loss of the
plaintiff by said overflow and suggesting
that an amicable settlement be made so
as to avoid prolonged litigation if it could
be dune witu advantage to the City.
Thereafter the Judiciary Committee of
the board gave a hearing to the attorneys
and officers of the plaintiff, at which
vouchers were introduced and proofs
made unaer oath showing the loss of the
plaintiff.
Touching the effort to settle the case
Mr. Cre&well says:
I had a representative from the office of the
City and County Attorney present to take part
in the examination of the witnesses of the
plaintiff. TnÂ« Judiciary Committee, after
hearing the evidence, referred the matter to
me for my advice in the premises, which I
promised to give on Saturday, March 6, 1897.
I appeared before the committee at that time
and toid it thai the attorneys and officers of
the plaintiff ha I agreed to take $4000 in lull
payment of nil damages against the City in
vo.ved in the above-mentioned suit. The
vouchers and proofs show an actual and un
dis uted damage largely in excess of the $4000
agreed to b â  taken in satisfaction thereof. In
cooa quence of which 1 recommended your
Judiciary Committee to agree to a settlement
on that b'isis, If a trial should be had the
plaintiff will, in my opinion, recover a much
larger sum than $4000, which would carry
with it the Costs ot suit. In which event the
City would only accomplish the unnecessary
ju-" of its money and waste of the time of its
officers.
FOOD FOR INSTITUTIONS.
Inspector Dockery Will Notify Cor
traitors 1 hat City Supplies Must
lie Inspected.
James P. Dockery, chief food and milk
inspector of the Board of IleaJth, has se
cured the names of all contractors who
simply food to the institutions of the City
and County. The purpose is to give no
tice to all these contractors that all their
supplies must be inspected bsfore they
can be accepted. This move is calculated
to provide pure lood for the City's wards.
ASKS TOR A STAR.
Ex - Policeman BloomfiXd Sacs for
Restoration on the Force.
William J. G. Bloomfield has riled an
action against the Police Commissioners
to compel them to reinstato him as a police
officer. He says that he was dismissed
from the service without proper cause in
1593, and that on the 6th of the present
month he applied to be appointed to a
vacancy then existing, inasmuch as the
Police Commissioners had hitherto re
stored to service one John E. Burriss. Mr.
Bloomfield, by his attorney, Nobby
Clarke, alleges that it was the duty of the
defendants to grant said restoration, yet
they "then and there, with an evil eye
and an unequal band, and in violation of
the laws of the United States, refused to
restore him."
Tie plaintiff asks that the Commission
ers show cause, if any they have, why the
court should not compel them to restore
him to office in order that he may draw
his salary ani nanicipale in the benefits
of the pension fund.

MARGARET CRAVEN
IN "RUY BLAS."
The Clever Actress Makes!
a Successful Reap
pearance.
"Jim the Penman" Pleasingly
Performed at the
Alcazar.
"Pinafore" Revived at Ih3 Tivoli.
Last Week of "Shore Acres"
at the Ealiwin.
When the Holland brothers decided to
abandon their Western tour the Columbia
Tneater was left without an attraction for
this week. In order that the house might
not bo closed, however, the management
en caged Joseph Hawortb, Miss Margaret i
Craven and some actors who happened to
be "resting" and in a very short time
"Ruy Bias" and a curtain-raiser by Au- '
gustus Thomas had been rehearsed and ,
last night they were given iheir first per
formance.
Tnomas' cnrtain-raiser, "A Man of the i
World," is a play with a moral, told in j
rather a preachy-preachy way by a Cap- j
tain Bradbury, whose admonitions recall
those of the tutor in that worthy old clas
sic, "Sanford and Marten." 'Hawortb, who
acted the captain, entered with zest into
the moral of the play by adopting a pulpit
style of oratory that at times lured one
into the belief that he was preaching a
Lenten sermon.
Miss Margaret Craven, with her hair
dressed in a new and very becoming way,
was warmly welcomed. Her part In "A I
Man of the World" did not nive her much
opportunity to show her ability, but she
made the most of the lit; le role.
Considering that "Ruy Bias" was hastily j
rehearsed it was an excellent performance.
The drama, as everyone will remember,
only falls heav.ly on the shoulders of three
of the performers â the Queen, Don Sal
luste and Ruy Bias himsÂ«lt, and owing to
this fortunate fact deficiencies in the
support did not come prominently to the
front, for Haworth astonished his warmest
admirers in the title-role. Miss Margaret
Craven gave a rendering of the Queen's
role which touched and moved her Uearers
even if she had not the power and majesty
ol some other Mariennes.
In his rendering of Ruy Bias Hnworth
did not follow slavishly in the footsteps
of Salvini or any other actor known to
fame. He gave his own interpretation ol
the part and played it on very romantic
and impassioned lines. There was a fresh
ness, almost a boyishness in the intensity i
of his lovelorn passion and despair, hut '
he redeemed his conception of Ruy Bias
from any imputation of effeminacy by his
manly bearing in the scenes with Don .
Salluste and with the Grandees ol Spain.
Miss Craven brought out especially the
pathetic, girlish side of the Queen's nature,
and moved her audience by the reality of
her ennui and heart-sickness under the
chafing restrictions of the court etiquette
anil the neglect of the King. Madge Carr
Cook gave a clever, if a somewhat exng
eerated, picture of the Duenna, and Alice
Perkins was a natural and girlish Casilda.
Carl Smith vai a fairly satisfactory Don
Salluste and will no doubt improve as he |
gains familiarity with Ins role.
"Ruy Bias" was well staged and was re
ceived with frequent applause, particu
larly in the strong scene where Ruy IJljs
defies the Duke and kills him. Trie ver
sion used was that translated and ar
ranged for Edwin Booth.
The Buih-Street.
Manager George E. Crater's company at the
Bush-street Theater began last night a new
play, "Arabian Nights," with the settings the
â¢ame as when It was produced at the Globe
Theater in London. There are nine people in
the cast, and there Is a good deal of fun scat
tered through the acts, which represent
morning, noon and night, respectively. Miss
Essie Tiule, who in times past has oven ap
peared on the stage in t?an Francisco, took the
part of the leading lady, as Rosa Coiumbier.
She is ft laughing, roistering young lady and
greatly snocks the dignified people in the
play, much to the amusement of the onlook
ers. Arthur Hummingtop, represented by
Arthur T. Arper, assumes ttie leading mascu
line role and gels into all kinds ol trouble by
having too many nieces calling to see him.
Tne remainder of the cast consists of the fol
lowing: Ralph Ormerod, Albert C. Ross;
Joshua Gillibrand, Bun Van deve; Dob.-.on,
Colin C; Mrs. Gillibrand, Miss Hattie Foiey ;
Mrs. Hummingtop, Miss Ida M. Parks ; Daisy
Maitlaud, Miss Clair Sinclair; Barbara, Miss
Cora Burns. The Hungarian Oro^stra fur
nished the music. There were some special
ties which added to the interest of the even
ing. Baby lx>uis danced, Henry Blake played
the zither and v\ illiuni G. Giffurd whistled.
Tivoli Upera-Houie.
"H. M. S. Pinafore," about the best of the
Gilbert and Suilivan operas, was presented last
night lv excellent styÂ»e. It Is called satirical
nautical opera, and most people know that it
was written to satirize Smith, the English
publisher, who had been shortly before ap
pointed First Lord of the Admiralty, without
knowing a thing about ships.
â¢â¢Pinafore" at the Tivo'.l is excellently
staged ; the ship and the sea are very realistic
and the view of Portsmouth hfirbor with the
ships and the old hulk outside is true to
reality.
Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Ad
miralty, was most amusingly played by Ferris
llartiiiaii, and his Cockney accent was without
ii flaw. Miss Sea brook made a chnrming !
Josephine and KafTael a very dignified ana :
melodious captain. Rhys Taomus was far I
from being an impassioned Ralph. Rackstraw;
one wondered what the lovely Josephine saw
in his love-making. Miss Holmes, too, did
| not make tho most of Little Buttercup.
Josie Intropedi was bright and pretty as
"Cousin" Hebe, and the chorus of sisters and
cousins and aunts were excellent. The sailors
were bright and tuneful, and W. H. West as
Deadeye looked nnd piayed the part extremely
well. W. H. Tooker made an excellent Doai
swaiu.
At the Orpheum.
The Flying Jordans made a tremendous hit
with their clever acrobatio act last night.
Several new feats were presented and loudly
applauded. Mails and Mails do some wonder
ful work and thougn their net is an extremely

cess. Burke, the comedian, who was last here
with Henderson's big company in "Aladdin,"
fairly set the auaieuce wild.

Miss Lorena Attwood played the customary
persecuted heroine very well.
The scenic effects were particularly good,
the old mill by the creek being most attractive.
At the Alcazar.
"Jim the Penman" was presented last night
at the Alcazar, 'lhe play was ai usual well
mounted, the costumes worn by the ladies ex
tremeiy pretty, and the performnnce good.
Hugo Tolaud appeared as James Raiston, the
former. Georgo Osbounie's Baron ilarttiield
was a remarkably clever bit of character work.
Aaele Btlgsrde, the bet-t a d most, attractive
of the Alcazar's leading ladies, impersonated

manner.

LOCAL FEDERAL OFFICES.
Several Narn r s Mentioned in
Connection With the Cir
cuit Judgeship.
Some Contend That Another Pacific
Coast State Should G;t This
Appointment.
Now that the inauguration of McKinlev
as President of the United States ha 3 be
come a retrospect the next subject of ma
terial interest and discussion araona; local
. politicians is the question. of Federal pat
ronage as exemplified in the periodical re
distribution of Government office* which
necessarily accompanies the advent oE a
new administration.
There ara several comfortable berths
which will have to he fiiled at an early
date, and there are more candidates tnan
there are berths to be tilled.
The name of District Judge Morrow is
popularly mentioned in connection with
the Circuit Judgeship left vacant by Judge
Joseph McKenna's recent resignation and
elevation to a portfolio. There are those
who assert that DeHaven's chances are
superior for the reason that Juilge Mor
row, prior to McKinley's nomination, was
not, it is said, one of the laiter's sud
portors, but was avowedly one of Tom
Reed's backers.
Other probable recipients of the judge
snip are District Judge Hanford of Wash
ington and ex-Senator Mitchell of Oregon,
in support of whom it is canned that in
asmuch as California received representa
tion in the Cabinet a resident of some
other Pacific Coast State should in justice
be appointed to rill the existing vacancy.
Joseph S. Spear, Colonel J. .P. Jackson
and Carlos Young, the commission mer
chant, are spoken of as possible aspirants
for the position of Collector of the Port,
and all three gentlemen have quite an in
fluential backing. Colonel Jactfbon is re
ported to possess the support of the Con
gressional delegation, but even so Mr.
Spear is a formidable opponent, and his
friends are positive in their assertion that
he will receive tho appointment. In that
event it is probable that Colonel Jackson
will receive the Surveyor-ship.
W. H. Quinn, manager of tho Hunting
tor.-Hopkins Company; James Borland,
and Mr. Bellingall, "tho Custom-house
broker, are the three most popular candi
dates for Collector of Internal Kevenue.
James Borland enjoys the advantage of
strong po itical interest. Senator Perkins,
Attorney-General McKennaand Secretary
of Stat9 Sherman being among his friends.
Mr. Quinn and Mr. BeJlincalt rely chiefly
upon commercial support, and have both
b?gun a determined right lor the coveted
appointment.

"IRISH NIGHT."

row .Evening.

of arrangements for the "Irish night" at

him to our City with a "caed mile failte" and
to assure him of our warm appreciation of his
services to Ireland In the past and to tender
him a heariy god-speed on his laudable mis*
sion to the United States.
Furthermore, we earnestly invite our fellow
citizens of San Francisco to rally round our
distinguished visitor in vast numbers in Met

him under their Tory administration in Ire

TOR SEVEN TJBENTH STREET.
The >i--.v Improvement Club Panel
Resolutions 1 hat Mean BasinesÃ<
The new Park Lane and Seventeenth
street Improvement Club held its reg
ular weekly meeting last evening at
Stevens' Hall, 4499 Seventeenth street.
The club is directing its energies toward
the opening and extension of Seventeenth
street, from Uranus to Ashbury.
To have the work done by private con
tract, wliich is the plan most desired by
the club as being the cheaper, the amount
necessary lo be subscribed is $4000. Only
about $1500 has been subscribed. With
this regard the following resolutions were
passed:
Resolved, That we try for one week more to
obtain subscriptions to have Seventeenth
street graded, and If the property-owners do
not subscribe liberally enough, .then be it
further
R.'solved, That we have an assessment dis
trict laid out by the Board of Supervisors to
have said Seventeenth street, graded from
Uranus street lo Ashbury, taking in the same
district that was assessed for the opening of
said street.
John T. Bremens and William Meyers
constitute the committee on subscriptions.
The club is determined to have a car
line on Seventeeth street and a di
rect outlet from the Mission to
the park, and this is the only
street south of Haight that, they say, can
be made a good direct driveway.
CUT IS THE NEOK.
Robert RorÂ« Kjected From a Colored
Club on Stockton Street.
There was a big row in a colored club at
210 Stockton street early yesterday morn
ing, and one of the members was slashed
in tne neck with a knife.
Robert Ross, known as the "Kisa-Eye,"
entered the club about 2 o'clock in the
morning. Soaie of the other members
objected to his presence and they at
tempted to eject him. In the struggle
Ross was badly beaten and finally found
hiiuseli in the street.
George Mosberry, the porter, followed
lloss into the street and continued tne
assault upon him. Ross knocked Mos
berry down and the porter jumped to his
feet and made a jab at Ross' nee!: with a
knife, inflicting a long, deep gash. Ross
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
Dr. Thompson stitched and dressed his
wound. There have been no arrests.
Editor Marriott'* Caie Pontponed.
The case of Editor Frederick Marriott of the
News Letter, charged with libeling Judge
Hebbard. was called in Judge Daingerfleld's
court yesterday. S. M. Shortridge, attorney
for Mr. Marriott, announced his readiness to
proceed, but other cases on the calendar
claimed precedence, and the trial was indefi
nitely postponed.
Severed Hi* Windpipe.
Henry Hastings, driver for William McKen
zie, coal-dealer, 918 Geary street, was taken to
the Receiving Hospital early yesterday morn
ing. He had cut his throat, severing his wind
pipe. Dr. Hartley stitched and dressed the
wound. Hastings appears to be out of his
mind, as he complained that the electric
Hghtu were chasing him around, and he could
not stuii'l it any loueer.
By the Gas Route.
Edward M. Langlin, & young man 21 years of
age, committed suicide early yesterday inorn
ing in a lodging-house at 5 Market street by
asphyxiation. He wa3 a gardener by trade
and had recently been apDointed by the Board
of Supervisors lo a position in Jefferson Square.
He was considered to be a little vreait-onuaed.

ALL FIVE ARE
COMING TOGETHER
Railway Labor Organiza
tions of Oakland
Active.
Big Meeting of Representatives
of All the Different
Branches.
Some Pertinent Words About Labor
Unionism and Its
Effects.
An open union meeting of the fire rail
way organizations was held in Odd Fel-
Jows' Hall, Oakland, on Sunday, all rive
organizations being well represented.
This was the third meeting of the Kind
within the past sixty days.
W. H. Pitts of the Order of Railway
Conduc'ors was chosen temporary chair
man and G. B. McClellan of the Brother-
T. M. PIERSON, Assistant Grand Chief, O. R. T.
hood of Railway Trainmen temporary
secretary.
Chairman Pitts called the meeting to
order at 3 p. m., and in a few well-chosen
â words stated the object of the meeting
was the same as that x>f the two previous
meetings, v-z. : Bringing about federation
of the five organizations representing five
different branches of the railway service,
namely: The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen, Broth ernood of Railway Train
men. Order of Railway Conductors and
the Order of Railroad Telegraphers.
T. M. Piersun, assistant grand chief of
tho 0. R. T., who is in this section of the
country looking after the interests of his
organization, was first introduced and
spoke for an hour in a very conservative
and interesting manner. On this occasion
he said in part:
We are assembled here to-day as representa
tives of the fine, old established conservative
organizations commouly called labor organi
zations, and labor organizations are at all
times subject to attack uy tne press end have
been denounced as no other institutions have
ever been. Yet, in spite of all tnis wa find the
combinations of wage-eainers when properly
handled grew more prosperous from day to
day and we attribute this evidence of vitality
to uo less a fact than that labor organizations
are a genuine product oi the social needs of
our people and are not only indespensable as a
protest against social wroujr.s but as a ueces
' t-ity to guard the toiler from such injury as
Borings from the misadministratioii of indus
trial government.
Labor organizations have been and still are
Instruments oi progress, aud through their
teachings worklngmen have gained and will
continue gaining material advantages, and
when operating under pood laws and a well
disciplined membership our organizations
not onlj' promote the interest of workingmen
by Increasing their reward in dollars and
corns, but uy reducing and uniforming their
hours of toil. Labor can never settle any
question of moral law by resorting to mob
i ule or ;he toi f h. Revolutionary priucipies
in organized labor have never been tse rule
ttiat has raised thu standard oi civilization in
the world's history. Law and order are the
only ruies for labor to be governed by, nnd
when we depart l'rum those rules public senti
ment will coudemn upon such action.
From one end of the continent to the other
the same greÂ«t questions are being discussed
â¢with a. view to discovering and working out
come plan whereby the' industrial prubicm
may be settled and the result of such, a settle
ment wiil bs productive of much good to em
ployer and employe alike. The duty oi organ
ized labor is to assist caen individual member
by wise ana conservative council and in all
questions of trouble aud difficulty we should
try to put ourselves in the other fellow's
place, and if we would do this the question of
strikes and lockouts would be a thing of the
j>ast; lopic and reason would take their place
in the settlement of all questions that might
arise.
The question of federation was dis
cussed at some length by tne spes.ker, and
much good argument was produced to
show the benefits that would accrue both
to the employer and employe if federation
was adopted. After (his the following
local members spoke in favor of federa
tion: J. B. Wilson and G. W. Carroll, of
the B. L. E.; L. J. Bulen. E. L. Talbott,
J. M. Adams, G. B. McClellan and George
Eames, of B. of R. T. ; Jlarrv Adams of
the B. of L. F.. W. K. Pitts, W. P. Bver*,
James Cahill and W. K. Martin, oi the O.
R. C, and others ot the several orders, of
which there was a great many present.
R. W. McGarvie, who for several years
â was deputy grand chief of the Order of
Railway Telegraphers and had charge of
that organization on the coast during the
American Railway Union strike In 1894,
Htid who has always been a strong adher
. pnt to the cause of federation, was pfesent
nnd made a few very interestinc remark.
He said although he was not in the rail
way service he hoped that federation
would be adopted.
By unanimous vote it was decided* that
union open meetings of this character
ehould be held o:> the first Sunday of each
month in Odd Fellows.' Hall, corner of
Seventh ar.d Peraita streets, Oakland, and
a cordial invitation is extended to all em
ployes of the Southern Pacific Company
to attend.
The iollowing permanent officers were
elected to continue the meetings: J. B.
Wilson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineer.", chairman ; C. E. Houck of the
Order of Railway Conductor*, vice-chair
man ; L. J. Bulen of the Brotherhood of
Railway Trainmen, secretary; Charles
Schu of the Order of Railway Conductors,
treasurer; and the following were elected
a tinance committee: U.Adams of the
Brotneruood of Locomotive Firemen, J.
B. Wilson of tfce Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers, E. L. Talbott of the Broth
erhood of Railway Trainmen, W. F. Byer
of the Order of Railway Conductors, R.
W. McGarvie for the Order of Railway
Telegraphers.
"SAID I TO MYSELF."
Peculiar Caption of a Discourse on
Theosophy Sunday Night by
Dr. Anderson.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson addressed the
local branch of the Theosophical Society
Sunday, hia subject as announced being
"Said I to Myself."
In his remarks Dr. Anderson spoke of
the different selves of consciousness
within one individual.
"This body," he said, "is something
that impedes the soul rather than aids it.
I desire to sharply distinguish between a
trance self which we can ourselves con
trol and the hypnotic self, which is a
cowardly, cringing self dominated by
another soul. He who allows another
soul to thus dominate his own has done a
very dangerous thing.
"Tbeosophy cries out its warning against
this dreadful practice which is now being
taught in this State. There is no case of
submission of innocence and purity to
vice which is not of this nature. More
! cursed becomes ibis domination when so
called scientific men practice it upon
young and innocent people for scientific
purposes."
Tne doctor spoke of the reasoning self as
the highest self, and he declared that the
I churchman's conception of a deity which
I could be angry, change its mind and con-
demn its loved ones to everlasting punish
ment was an outrage to the reasoning self.
He contended for a deity which was a con
ception of the best and noblest things
which men could comprehend.

PASTORS WANT REVIVALS
An Effort Being Made to Bring
Evangelist Munhall
H2re.
Rev. J. M. Alexander Talks About
the Islands of the
Pacifi:.
An effort iB being made by some of the
ministerial bodies of this City to bring
Evangelist Munhall here for a four weeks'
series of revival meetings, to be held in
some City church. Rev. Dr. Hemphill
introduced the subject at the Presbyterian
Ministerial Association, and the following
committee was appointed to confer with
other bodies: Rev. Dr. Hemphill, Rev. C.
C. Herriott, Rev. Dr. Mathena, Rev. E.
Jenks and Captain Hal].
The Methodist preachers' meeting ap
pointed all the Methodist Episcopal min
isters in the City on the committee. On
Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock the
joint committees will meet at the Young
Men's Christian Association, and in the
meantime other ministerial bodies will be
communicated with in order that they
may be represented. /
Evangelist Munhall was the speaker at
the Methodist preachers' meeting yester
day. His subject was "Evangelists and
Their Relation to the Church and Pastor."
He spoke strongly in favor of people be
ing saved as, Chris tians rather than as
members of any particular denomination.
Rev. J. M. Alexander. gave an address
on "The 'islands of the Pacific" at the
Presbyterian Ministerial. Association. In
speaking of the Marquesas Islands he re
; gretted deeply the effect of French do
| minion, Raying it had been deplorable and
! demoralizing. . .
Booth Tucker will be the speaker at the
! Presbyterian Ministerial. Association on
) the inst., and it is expected that a
] union meeting with other denominations
will be arranged for the occasion.
At the Christian Ministers' Club Rev.
Dr. James Small of Oakland" read a paper
on "The Baptism of the Holy Spirit."
Orphanage Sunday.
At the meeting of the Presbyterian
Orphanage and Farm yesterday it was re
solved to ask â  the Presbyterian I Sunday
schools throughout the State to hold an
annual Orphanage Sunday, in order to
take tin collections for the orphanage.
Each Presbyterian. Church will also be
asked to take a general interest in two
boys in the home and assist in clothing'
them. The rented building at San Rafael
is full to overflowing, and every effort is
being made to raise funds for building on
the property belonging to the orphanage
at San Anselmo. ,â â¢ / ; ;
Macomber Will Stay.
For some time past the Methodist Epis
copal pastors have been using their in
fluence to have Chaplain r Macomber of
Angel Island moved to the Presidio, as
they believed that he would have a .wider
sphere 'of usefulness there. ; Chaplain
Macomber, however, has expressed his
de ire to remain at Angel Island, where
he â  considers he is most needed, ior there
is no other preacher there and the soldiers
do not want for preaching at the Presidio.
All' efforts to have the chaplain removed
have therefore been dropped. ;.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 3IARCH 9, 1897.
BARNES WILL
HAVE A DEPUTY
District Attorney Will Get
an Assistant for One
Month.
Supervisors Would Not Add Per
manently to the Salary
List
Franchise Sought for a Street Railway
Will Be Considered by Attorney
Creswell.
The Board of Supervisors appointed a
Deputy District Attorney yesterday upon
something like a limited liability plan.
The original proposition contained in the
resolution introduced by Supervisor Britt
was to name Joseph P. Dunne at a
monthly salary of $250 as such deputy.
When the resolution came up yesterday
Supervisor Clinton moved to indefinitely
postpone, and said that there was no need
for the appointment. A deputy had been
appointed during the Durrant case, but
there was no work to justify the employ
ment of a deputy now. Before the dispo
sition of the matter was reached remarks
were made in opposition to the appoint
ment by Mayor Fhelan and Supervisors
Dodge and Clinton. Supervisor Britt
spoke in favor of it. Supervisor Smith
said that ho had found that there are
many criminal cases to De tried, and that
it would be better economy to employ the
deputy than it would be to support forty
six persons indefinitely who are in prison.
After several votes on various proposi
tions looking to indefinite postponement,
postponement for one week, and so on. in
cluding a proposition by Supervisor Clin
ton to have the Mayor appoint a commis
sion of three to inquire concerning the ne
cessity of the appointment, Supervisor
Clinton's motion to employ Mr. Dunne for
one month finally prevailed. The only
Supervisor voting no was Mr. Lackman.
Joseph E. O. Donnell was appointed
special counsel for the collection of de
linquent taxes. A report of the Judiciary
Committee was also adopted making his
compensation 25 per cent instead 01 5 per
cent.
Some discussion took place concerning
revenue to bs secured from licenses. The
subject came up over the application of
the Belmont Social Club for a free permit
to hold a masquerade ball. The permit
was granted. Mayor Phelan suggested
that the License Committee should estab
lish some scale of licenses to provide reve
nue for the City and County from mas
querade balls and also that boxing
matches should pay a license,
Tiie recommendation of the City and
County Attorney to pay Buckingham &
Hecht $4000 in settlement for damages in
curred by reason of the Army-street sewer
overflow was adopted and the money was
voted. Tne expectoration ordinance was
finally passed and will now go into effect.
The proposed order to make the police
keep the aisles and lobbies of tbeatera
clear went over two weeks on motion of
Supervisor Britt. The printing order also
went over two weeks, Supervisor Haskins
saying that the trades wisli to present a
sunstitute for consideration by the board.
The Market-street Railway Company
bid $20 for a franchise ior a street railway
over the following streets:
Commencing at the intersection of Masonic
avenue with Oak street, thence along Masonic
avenue to its intersection with Page street,

SO PAPA GOT THE MONEY
The District Attorney Did Not
Collect Attorney Adams'
Fee.
General W. H. L. Barn?s Conducted
the Julius Kihn Political Cases
and Collected the Money.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger devoted
an afternoon yesterday to hearing the tes
timony in the case of F. Adams vs. W. S.
Barnes and ten seconds in delivering his
decision in favor of the defendant.
F. Adams is an attorney, and his claim
wap tnat he had been employed by County
1 Clerk Curry and others to argue thejr case
before the Election Commissioners and
the various courts in the matter of the
"Tenure of Office Act of 1893," which ul
timately resulted in a victory for his cli
ents, lor his services he was to have re
ceived $100 that never maierialized, and
lie claimed that tbe money had been paid
to AY. S. Barnes, from whom he sought 10
recover.
County Clerk Curry testified that $200
had been paid over oy his office through
bis chief deputy, Piper, toward a fund for
legal fees to fight tbe cave. lie haÂ«t met
W. S. Barnes and between themselves
tney had decided that Attorney Adams
was entitled 10 a fee of $100.
"Barnes 1 chief deputy, Blair, had col
lected the money from Chief Deputy
Piper in my office," said Curry, "and
Barnes told me lie would see that Adams
would eventually pet his pay."
Deputy Piper and Deputy Blair remem
bered very little in regard to the matter â
not enough, however, to either conoborate
or deny any statements made with any
degree of vehemence that could carry con
viction.
Attorney Adams testified in answer to
his associate counsel, J. L. Nogle'?, in
quiries, telling the story of bis deal with
Curry and W. 8. Barnes.
General W. H. L. Barnes, the father of
the defendant, took the stand and told
the story that won the case.
"I never knew that Attorney Adams
had anything to do with the case," ne
said.
"I mnde a contract with City and
County Attorney Creswell to attend to the
suits. Tliere was to be a fee of $4000 in it,
nnd Creswell suggested that some of the
Democratic office-holders would object to
paying a Republican lawyer. He sug
gested al?o that Attorneys Foote and
Coogan be eniployed. While I was pained
to think of civ. ding the fee, I tell proud
of being associated with these gentlemen,
and aquiesced.
''Tho case was lost before Judge Sea
well, and there, for the first time, I heard
of Mr. Adams' connection with it. He
quoted some statutes ana there his ser
vices ended so far as I can remember, ex
cepting that I used some data he produced
to argu9 ihe appeal before the Supreme
Court, when Attorney McEnemey was
al^o in the case.
"I learned from W. S. Barnes after
that that Curry wanted some fee paid to
Attorney Adam?, but I declined to do
tins, as out of $4000 which should have
come in ihe 'charity fund' for Foote. Coo

BUDDHA'S IDEA OF SCIENCE
Rev. H. Dharmapala Tells How Tran
scendental Knowledge Can He
Acquired.
Rev. H. Dharmapala of India, proselyte
of the Buddhistic faith, sppka at Shasta
Hall in the Native Sons' building Sunday
evening. His subject was: "Buddhistic
and Brahminical Transcendental Sci
ence."
The speaker described the powers for
good or evil, which, he said, many Brah
mins at one time possessed through their
great knowledge. This power they came
to use to ths detriment of their race,
thinKing only of their own selfish desires.
"The Brahmins." he said, "had great
power, but Buddha wished not power and
destruction but protection and comfort.
To this end he demanded that students of
these mysteries should first purify them
seives in thought, in word and in deed."
The manner of attaining this knowledge
was then detailed upon. The great
requisite, it was explained, was concen
tration, and in order to attain this con
centration certain principles of conduct
were laid down. These were, in general,
compassion, which precluded the taking
of life, honesty, chastity, truth and tern
uerance. By adhering to these principles
it was maintained that unalloyed joy
could De secured.
DharmapaU to Lecture.
The Rev. 11. DharmapaU will lecture this
evening at B'o'clock at Native Sons' building
on "The Continuity of Life."

Used a Rope to Gain an
Entrance Through the
Skylight.
Opportune Arrival of the Ship
Santa Clara From
Newcastle.
Very Hard Luck of the British Ship
Silbsrhorn While en Her Way
to Victoria.
Peter Wilson, a negro bnrglar whom the
water front police have been searching for,
is at last in custody. He has been in the
habit of letting himself down through the
skylight of James Murray's place on
Washington street by a rope ana taking
everything his hands could Jay on.
Sunday last Murray bad occasion to
visit his office, and he found Wilson at
work ami at once gave the alarm. Officers
Maboney and Hall were soon on the scene
and placed the negro under arrest. He
made his entrance by a ropo fastened to
he skylight and being a sailor had no dif
*.ciiljy in getting out of the window again.
A Among the few arrivals yesterday was
â¢ the American ship Santa Clara. She
made the run from Newcastle, N. S. W.
in seventy-five days, but the captain is not
at all elated over the performance. She
brings a cargo of coal for" the Alaska
Packers' Association, and that concern is
very anxious to get it landed and the ship
ready for a trip to, Alaskan waters with
cannery supplies. The canta Clara left
Newcastle on December 24 and had noth- j
ing but light ana baffl.ing winds trom i
Australia to port.
J. H. Wilson, who stabbed Oscar Mel
drum in a saloon on San Bruno road, was
arrested on the water front yesterday
afternoon. Meldrum was stabbed seven
times, but none of the wounds were con
sidered dangerous ; except one in the ab
domen. He is doing well at the City and
County Hospital, and the physicians
think He will be all right in a few days.
Yesterday afternoon Detective Cody and
Stenographer. Heyneman went to the hos
pital and took Meldrum's statement,
which is as follows:
My name is Oscar Mowbray Meldrum. I am
52 years of age, born in the county of Dur
ham, England. I have been heie six years
and am a master mariner.
We closed up the saloon Golden City House,
San Bruno roadâ Mrs. Wilson and I. I am a
barkeeper there, and old man Wilson com
menced to growl about my making mischief
with his wife. He called me out in the yard
and we had words and we came in the kitchen
again, had more words, and we came to blows.
The first thing I knew I was cut. Captain
Wilson did the cutting. I went out on the
porch to put out the light. This was aoout 10
o'clock. While I was doing this Wilson went
to the till, ami Mrs. Wilson's son told me he
(Wilson) took 50 cents, and I told Mrs. Wilson.
She then told her husband to "get out" and
he went out. I locked the door and we went
back to the kitchen and sat down with the
daughter Florence eating supper.
Wiisou then came to the side window and
knocked, and Mrs. Wilson told him to go
away and go home. Instead of doing so he
came to a side ga;e and raised up my window
and came. through to the fciteuen-door and
"broke the screen off the door, â¢ inserted his
.->Â»- band *ad-fulled. back thÂ« bolt, and then we
i hud the.trouble as Mated.
1 The Merchants' Exchange reporter at
" Meiggs wharf reported yesterday that a
ratt of creosoted timber was picked up this
morning near Point Bonita by the Fort
Point life-saving crew, and while endeav
oring to tow it back into the harbor a
heavy sea -struck it and sent it on the
rocks riear Fort Point, where the life
saving crew are now taking care of it. It
is owned by the San Francisco Lumber
preserving Company.
The British ship Silberhorn, previously
reported, bad a rough experience, She
was" on her way from Liverpool to Victo
ria, B. C, and in a gale lost a suit of sails
had her compasses deranged, her steering
gear damaged ana the high and low
bridges carried away. Three of the crew
were washed overboard and drowned, and
finally the vessel had to put into Barry

The murder of Henry E. Sullivan by
Policeman George Dougherty in Lun
stedt's saloon, O'Farrell and Powell
streets, Sunday night, haÂ« cauÂ«ed a pro
found sensation in the Police Department.
Dougherty was known to be a qui^t, in

him the credit of never having been called
before him for any breach of duty, now-

ever slizhr. He joined tho force Septem
ber 16, 1892. j
Why such a man should have shot down
a companion in such a deliberate and ap
parently cold-blooded manner is what is
puzzling the police authorities.
As far as can be learned there was no
old grudge between Dougherty and Sulli
van, and those who knew them both Bay
they were always on friendly terms.
Dougherty was ausr>ended by the Chief
yesterday morning and a charge of mur
der was booked against him. His case
was called in Judge Campbell's court and
for a week. He was delirious
yesterday morning at the hospital, but
later hÂ» was resting easier. The surgeons
express the opinion that he will recover.
He jeema to be' suffering thÂ« pangs of re
morse and refuses steadily to discuss the
shooting except to say that he was to
blame in the matter.
James Boyle, who was with Dougherty
and Sullivan at the time or the shooting
and was detained as a witness, as he re
! fused to talk, made the following state
ment yesterday morning:
I live on Twenty-second and Maryland
streets, Potrero. I. tend bar for my father,
who Is a snloon-keeper. Yesterday about l
p. m. Sullivan and I left the Potrero and went
to he dogfaces at Ingleside. We were there
until about 6 P. M., when 'we left aad went
down to have an I Milan dinner at Bazzuro's
on Pacific street. During: the day we had a
few drinks. V3ggÃ&s
After dinner we walked up Kearny street,

Dougherty. I have known him about four
months. We met him in the neighborhood of
9 o'clock, and we walked around.' town and
had teveral drinks. â¢ We then went up to Lv li
sted^ saloon, on Powell and O'Farreil streets,
and got there sometime between 11 and. 12.

with each other. I heard some shots, but I
couldn't swear who fired them. 1 was full at
tho time. I did not know that Dougneriv had
shot himself until I heaid so down here at the
City Prison.
I do not know of any trouble existing be
tween Sullivan and Dougiierty. As far as I
Know they were alwnys the best of friends and
had no words at all last nistlit that I know of.
I lid not see the shooting as I was looking the
other way. Tetter 1 heard the snooting I saw
Sullivan fall and did not see Dougherty.
An autopsy was held yesterday on Sulli
van's body by Drs. Gailagber and Morgan
a*, the Coroner's office. It was found that
both bullets had Dierced the heart. The
tiunctures were ab.au two inches apart
and either would have caused almost in
stant death. The inquest v/ill beheld to
da\'.
Detective Charles Cody was detailed on
the case last night. He went to ihe hos
pital and had a talK with Dougherty, but
cou d not get him to make any statement
beyond the fact thet he did the shooting
and was sorry for it. He said he had seen
his father, brothers and sisters, and did
not want to say anyining more to any
body.
It was learned lest night that there had
been for the past two weeks a bad feeling
between Dougherty and Sullivan. Both
were dog fanciers and used to attend the
coursing at lnpleside. Two weeks ago last
Sunday they were both interested in one
of the coursinsr events and Dougherty lost,
lie tlnmed Suliivan for "jobbing" him
and Sullivan resented the imputation.
The sparring bout in Luns'edt's saloon
Sunday night between them was at first
thought to be for fun, but now it is be
lieved to have been in earnest. Both
were clever boxers, but Sullivan, accord
ing to eye-witnesses, had the advantage,
as he was taller and heavier. Dougherty,
smarting u.ider his disadvantage, called
Sullivan an offensive name, and Sullivan
was advancing upon aim when he was
shot.
TOE THE CARNIVAL.
ThÂ» State Tloral Society to Contribute.
Native Sons.
In connectiou with the floral show to be
given during carnival week by the Cali
fornia State Floral Society, under the
direction of Professor Emory E. Smith, an
exhibit of the liva birds of the Pacific
Coast is -low being arranged. This is the
first time an attempt of this kind has been
made in this City.
Members of the joint committee of
Naiive Sons and Native Daughters are
making excellent progress with their
arraneem nts for California day. Tuesday,
May 4. They had a long conference with
the carnival committee yesterday, and
many novel ideÂ»s were suggested. The
l>aiade, which will open the festivities in
the morning, promises to exceed iv point
of numbers an 7 that has bt-en held here.
For the afternoon the arrangements are
not yet complete.
The grand Da n a t the Mechanics' Pa
vilion which wijl close the festivities has
received the indorsement of all the par
lors of both orders in the City. No de
cision has been reached as to its character,
although many favor a fancy-dress affair,
masks to be rigidly excluded. A com
mittee of the Native Daughters, consist
ing of Mrs. Lena B. Mills, Miss Annie
Donaldson and Mrs. Perkins, has been
appointed to prepare tableaux for pre
sentation during tne evening.
The faculty of the University (of Cali
fornia has granted the students a holiday
on Monday. May 3, and on Friday after
noon, May 7, that tney may participate in
the carnival. Professor Newcomer of
Stanford University has informed the car
nival committee "that exercises will be
arranged at Stnnford so that the students
of that university may meet with their
rivals iv the carnival festivities.
RETIREMENT DF
CHIEF CROWLEY
He Is Now in a Position
to Do So at Any
Time.
Passage of the Pension and
Salary BiPs Taken as a
Ccmpliment.
The Chief Says He Will Not Tend.r
His Resignation Ju;t at
Present.
The information received trom Sacra
mento yesterday that the Governor had
signed the bill increasing the salaries of
certain oflic.als of the Police Department
gave great satisfaction to those directly
interested.
Tne liil!, which takes effect immedi
ately, increases the salary of the Chief to
$5000. The office of chief of detectives is
created at a salary of $3000, and Capsain
Lees will now be known as Chief of De
tectives Lees. The salaries of the five
captains â Wittman, Spillane, Gillen, Dun
levy and Robinsonâ Property Clerk
Moran and Clerk Healey are increased
to $2500 each, and the salary of each of the
fifteen detectives to $1800. The total in
crease per month of ail the salaries is
$966 CS.
Tne lieutenants, five in number, are not
included in the Bill, because the office was
created by the Board of Supervisors. They
draw a salary of $140 per month, and as
their duties are of a responsible nature it
is felt that it would be only in the sense
of justice that their salaries siiould be in
creased by the .Board of Supervisors.
The question of the retirement of Chief
Crowley, now that ttie amendment to the
pension bill covering his case and the
salary bill have been approvea by the
Governor, has again cropped up.
Last year shortly after iho death of his
son the Cnief tendered his resignation.
It was pointed out to him that the pen
sion act cahed for twenty years' consecu
tive service in the department, and as
there had been a break in nis twenty-three
years of service he would not be entitled
to his pension if he insisted upon the ac
ceptance of his resignation. Acting upon
the advice of the Police Commissioners
the Chief withdrew his resignation.
The Chief felt gratified yesterday when
he learned that the salary bill had been
signed by the Governor, as he considered
it was a deserved compliment to the de
partment.
"The salaries of the captains," snid the
Chief, "were utterly inadequate, and were
very much lower than in any oilier city
on the continent. lam very much pica ed
that the Legislature has increased them
to a fair amount.
"As to my retirement I have no inten
tion of doing so just at present. lam
now placed in the position that I can re
tire when I like, and circumstances will
guide me as to when that shall be. Ii
will not be just at present anyhow, and
that is all I can say."
The pension bill enacts that any mem
ber of the department alter serving
twenty years and having attained the agÂ«
of 60 y^ars or over can retire on halt puy
according to the rank held by him for not
less than one year prior to the acceptance
ol his resignation by the Police Commis
sioners.
That is to say to secure the half pay of
a captain there must have been at least
one year's service in t>at capacity.
This does not apply to the Chief, as he
has held no other position, but it is
thought that he will yet serve for at least
one year under the increased salary, so
as to do away with any cause for criti
cism.

The Wheelmn's Committee Will
Soon Open an Active Canvass for
Subscription.
Tho unemployed exploited a portion
of Chinatown yesterday in response
to a Brecial invitation from several
of the leading Mongolian merchants, and
were substantially rewarded for their
trouble by receiving a wagon-load of r>ro
visions, a quantity of clothing and about
$50 in cash.
At least 150 men were in line in front of
the wagon and among the vanguard was
the standard-bearer witn a banner in-
scribed to the following effect in Chinese
characters:
There are in this City 10,000 unemployed
men, hungry, destitute, utmost driveu to
desperation. The white merchants have, in a
measure, acted liberally, but cannot meet
every requirement, hence we are compelled to
apply to you folk.
The reception accorded the unemployed
by the denizens of Chinatown was most
hospitable. Few refusals were encount
ered and in many cases the contributions
were entirely unsolicited. Small coins
were thrown from tne windows of the
upper stories by men, women and chil
dren and occasionally a passer-by would
rush up to the line and drop 23 ceuts, 50
cents or a dollar into the offertory- box.

The tickets for this evening's benefit are
going rather more slowly than could be
wished, and the public i"Â«, therefore, re
minded that the box office at the Audi
torium is now open and that plenty of
25 and 50 cent seats are still available.
Several of the citizens' district and
special committees were out again yes
terday, and the result of their activity
was speedily apparent in the shape of
more than $700 additional in the hands of
Daniel Meyer. The most noteworthy sub
scription! were from Hermann Oelrichs,
Mrs. Theresa Oelrichs and Miss Virginia
Fair, each of whom cave $100 to the fund.
Another unknown Ir ; end gave $200. The
receipts up to 4 o'clock stood as follows:

The total added to the Bum of $4112 pre

Mr. Sbarboro, the chairman of the wine
makers' and wine-dealers' committee, has
also collected â¢ nearly $300, which will be
turned in to-day, ana t .c special com
mittee on bankÂ« should experience no
difficulty in raising more than $1000.
A definite move was taken yesterday
afternoon .toward securing the co-opera
tion of the City wheelmen, attached and
otherwise, in the boulevard proposal.
Ex-Mayor Ellert, who originally made
the â  suggestion, had a conference with
Judge Kerrigan, chief consul of the
League of American Wheelmen, and
Charles A. Adams, for the purpose of de
vising a plan of action. Mr. Ellert'3 idea
is that subscription liÂ«ts should be left at
the various bicycle clubs and cycleries of
the City, and he has sngeested that a
verbal appeal to thÂ» wheelmen and wheel
women who patronize the park. when the
weather is line might be made some Sun
day afternoon by somebody who is well
known and popular among the fraternity.
The league is also considering another
project, further particulars about which
will appear later, whereby both the league
and the unemployed may be benefited. ?
Henry Wynne is chairman of the wheel
men's committee and associated with him
are C. A. Adams, .George P. Wetmore,
Judge Kerrigan and Victor A. Hancock.
A meeting of the committee will be held
this evening to discuss ways and means.
The question of the Sutro right-of-way
deed was again 'before the Board of Super
visors yesterday afternoon. Reuben
Lloyd, Mr. Sutro's attorney, assured the
board that Mr. Sutro was anxious to ex
pedite matters a3 much as possible, but
that he felt compelled to obtain some
guarantee that concessions on his part
would not immediately expose him to
ruinous expense. Mr. Lloyd pointed out
that his client had expended nearly all his
ready money on his electric railway and
out at the cliff an<l that a prospective de
mand for, say $100,000, in the way of im
provements on ins portion or the boule
vard was something he was not prepared i
to face.
Mr. Sutro, however, has expressed him
self willing to givo a deed of trie right of
way and place it in escrow for three years.
The question will be further discussed be
fore the Street Committee this morning at
10 o'cloctc.
In the opinion of one of the members of
the Citizens' Executive Committee it is
not absolutely nece sary for the committee
to await the outcome of this complication
before commencing work. The men, he
think-, might start at the present boule
vard terminm and continue it therefrom
until Mr. Sutro and the City have arrived
at aldennite agreement.
Following are the events as they will
come at the great finals in the tug-of-war
at Mechanics' Pavilion Tuesday night for
the benefit of the unemployed :
First, Sweden vs. Canada; second, Italy vs.
France; third, America vs. winner of pull be

fourth, Norway vs. Italy, "challenge pull" for

I tried patent medicines, but, instead of improving I grew worse. Finally
I bought some

NtW YOIIK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. March *S.â The week
opened with an improved feeling in financial
Circes. The marketfor specia ties was encouraged
by the mo:e reassuring advices from Crete in
regard to the Grecian-Turkish complications. This
news received a general value from the advance cf
over 1 percent in British consols in London and
from the increased lirmness of the Continental i
markets. Local operators who sold stocks on the
closing days of last week on the war scare covered
freely at the opening and in a short time prices
advanced 114 to 1% PÂ«T cent right through Ibe
list. It is proper to add that in a inajoiity of in
stances the highest quotations of the day were
attained before the expiration of the first half hour
rf business, following which there was a reaction
in sales by small traders to realize profit.
The Improvement was also checked for a time
by the development of marked weakness in Man
hattan and Jersey Central. .he lormer fell from
18714. to 84y a on reports that the directors at their
meeting to-morrow will reduce the rate of divi
dendsfrom 6 to either 5 or 4 per cent n-r annum.

In sympathy with a fall of seven, po.n in i.ehigh
and Wi;kesbarre consols. Jersey central 5s aiso
vlelaed about, two points. During the afternoon
the stock recovered to 96%, while Delaware and

responding day a year ago. There was a continu
ance of tne excellent demand witnessed last week,
and prices continued on the upgrade, a further ad
vance of.about 10c "$ 100 lbs taking place. Cattle
are now selling much betier than tor a long time
past with the exception of a few fancy lots which
have not varied much.
The sharp advance in prices of togs last week
! failed 10 stimulaie the shipments to this market,
and arrivals to-day were much smaller than on re
cent Mondays. A few weeks ago 40,0i'0 hogs was <
an ordinary supply for the first day of the week.
To-day's run wan barely :i3,000, against 38,721
last Monday, 27,924 a year ajo and 30,5i>1* two
year* ago. The reduced supply Jailed to strengthen
the market, however, as the packers held off for .
concessions. Pr.ces broke 2Va@sc $ 100 lb.Â» a:ter

Sales of sheep and lambs were slow early this !
morning, fleeces being lull of water and buyers, in '
consequence, showe'i a waiting disposition. Later,
however. Ira ie became active, as the receipts were
estimated at only 12,000, against an early esti
mate of 14. C00. The supply was well taken at
stronger prices. .

Garrity for City Attorney and Clement

that City Engineer Wilson will not sue

HOW IT CAME ABOUT.
The Great Battle Over Candidates
and Saloons at the Polls.
OAKLAND. Cal., March B.â The elec
tion is over and the fate of candidates and
saloons has been settled in municipal
politics for iwo years.
The politicians slept but little last night,
and what few surprises developed during
the cumpai^n were nearly all reserved for
its closing hours.
Not until yesterday was there the slight
est evidence on the part of the saloon men
that they intended mating a single effort
to offset the work of the temperance peo
ple. All day yesterday circulars were
placed in every doorway and in the hand
of everybody that was on the street set
ting for'h the condition of affairs that its
author nredicted would be the result of a
majority vote to close the saloons. A
good deal of personal venom was raani
:e*ted, but it could hardly have had any
effect, as long before it made its appear- I
ar.ee the voting pubic must naturally |
hiive made up its mind.
La-<t night at the Army and Navy
League there was an excited session.
Cards had been distributed during the day
among the firemen soliciting support for
Wilson and Dow. the Republican nomi
nees for the Board of Puolic Works. The
knowledge of this got to the veterans mid
they we;e exceedingly wrathy, because it
was a violaton of the ru:es of the depart
ment, and also because it did not contain
the name of tbAeir candidate for Mayorâ J
Captain Thomasâ who was also a Repub
lican.nominee. A cursory investigation
seemed to show that the cards originated
with Fire Chief Fair, and Arthur Wilson
was sent for and sn explanation de
manded.
Mr. Wilson expressed his entire inno
cence of the affair, but his statement wa^
not entirely acceptable to the old soldiers
and no d mbtcut a little ngure in to-day's
v te.
City Attorney Peirsol, who has stood by
Chief Fair throughout the administra
ti n, and who has been running to succeed
Inmselt and relied partly upon :he strength
of the Fire .Department, was particularly
incensed at Fair, and there is more than a
probability that when the Hoard of Works
meet, Peirsol and D:ivie, who have never
yet voted together, except to pass salary
bills, may suspend and nosÂ«ibly dismiss
Chiei Fair from his position.
At the la-t moment the saloon men
passed iicket3 around containing the
names or candi lates favorable to them.
This ticket, however, was not nltogether
reliable, for in at least one ward a cadi
didate's name was used most certainly
j not for trie purpose of helping his elec
tion.
When the polls opened the rain was
pouring and those who had been making
the Â«nti-saloon fight felt their spirits fall
likewise. Their greatest hope of success
depended upon a large vote being polled.
The radical element always patronize the
voting places at Oakland elections, and
with them alone the saloon issue was con
sidered doubtful. With the addition,
however, of about 1500 voters who remain
at home unless dragged to the polls, the
anti-saloon campaigners considered their
chances V"ry bright.
The unpleasant weather, however, did
not deter the ladies from taking their
places at the legal distance from the
booths and protected by an umbrella
handine to the voters little tickets with a
pi asant request to take note of the names
upon them. In some instances the ladies
took their lunch in little baskets and
placed them on the sidewalk while they
actively pursued their work of presenting
cards.
When the sun came out, their hopes
quickly rose, and as the vote through ut
the day was unusually heavy, more so in
some precinct.- than at the last Presiden
tial election, the anti-saloon people wore
a smile of confidence as they anticipated
the prospective vote.
In those wards where lived the commu
ters the result showed that this class of
residents did their duty as never before.
In the Seventh Ward, wnere the majority
of them live, out of 2162 votes, 1700 had
been cast up to noon; at several precincts
for the first two or three hours the vote
cast averaged one a minute, and never
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1897.
have so many ballots been put into the
box before 10 o'clock as wera deposited to
day. It was very evident, judging by the
number of people in line, that in some of
the precints having the greatest number
of voters, more booths would have been
very acceptable.
So uncertain was the strength of the
various candidates, even until the early
returns had b j en received, that up to the
niinute of closing the polls four of the five
candidates for Mayor were each positive
thftt they had carried the day. Never has
such doubt existed for many years, nor
has such supreme confidence been mani
fested by the friends of the various candi
dates. This is also true of the offices for
City Attorney, City Engineer and several
of the Cuuncilmen. Even after 7 o'clock,
when there whs little doubt as to the tren
eral result of the vote, candidates whose
figures were continually getting further
and further behind would pin tueir faith
to some favorite precinct or ward and de
clared that they would yet come out
ahead.
Contrary to precedent, the streets pre
sented a busy scene the whole day, and
although the saloons ol course were closed
the class of people on the street were not
of the nature that patronized those places.
Not a Solitary Fight.
The reputation of the First Ward for
political activity was well maintained, the
chief struggle being for a Councilman.
Assessor Dal ton was buttonholing every
body in behalf of J. S. Coiourn and, James
Henneberry had quite a little army work
ing for bim.
In all the precincts bia votes were cast
and decorated buggies with their lettering
rendered almost illegible by the frequent
showers were Sitting to and fro in every
diroction. All the leading candidates
made a tour of the ward at some period
of the day and all found many earnest
and possibly t irsty supporters, but no h
ing could be done so alieviate their suffer
ings until after 5 o'clock, and as the can
didate cares very little for the voter whan
the pools are closed, the First Ward is
quieter than usual this evening.
Evidently First Warders are anxious to
annex every; hing in >ight, for tho petition
relating to taking in tlie northern terri
tory was signed by nearly evprybodv who
voted. Durin the early morning the
booths were patronized to such an extent
that it was necessary to erect more. Al
though so active the First Ward broke its
record, and the be3t of decorum prevailed
throughout the day.
Where Mrs. Aram Worked Hard.
The Second Ward was very quiet. Many
of the voters had to take an extra trip to
find out where they could legally cast
their ballots. At the county election Clerk
Jordan sent a card to every voter telling
him where he would find his polling
booth. It would have been well had the
City Clerk followed the precedent to-day.
The precinct lines in some of the wards
are different at city and county elections,
and this difference caused the confusion.
One of the most earnest workers in this
ward was Mrs. W. F. Aram, who enjoys
the distinction of having once been a
Deputy Sheriff. She was making an ar
dent fight for Frank Girard, candidate for
Councilman.
Johnny Holmes, the well-known union
printer, was campaigning for A. C. Henry
for Mayor and incidentally doing some
good work for the Democratic ticket.
The ladies pursued their work until the
bulk of the voters had been to the polls
and then went home.
Bowed to the Antl-Saloonlsts.
Professar X B. Meads of the High
School was the most conspicuous fi.ure in
the Third. He is a vigorous prohibition
campaigner and entered heartily into the
anti-saloon campaign. He wore a large
white and yellow badge, big enough for a
napkin, on which was printed in big black
letters, "Close the saloons."
To everybody that went near Â«nough to
him to be spoken to he confidently pro
claimed: "We are going to win."
Rev. H. M. McKnight, Rev. J. E. Bush
nell and others pushed the anti-saloon
end of the fight in such an able inaunei
that the old-time politicians stood quietly
by nnd pained some pointers.
Affairs in this ward seemed to be en
tirely in the hands of those who are
anxious to close the saloons, and although
a bisr vote was cast everything was very
quiet, no challenges were made, and when
5 o'clock came everybody seemed relieved.
Two Friends With One Idea.
Very bitter was the contest in the Fourtu
Ward, la this ward Robert Boyer, the
Republican nominee for the Council, and
Con Krosnahan, the D^aiocratic incum
ben:, sliare the honor of popularity. So
bitter did the feeling become that 'in the
Second Precinct a little affair occurred
that would have been be;ter located at
Carson on the 17th. For causing an op
ponent's blood to flow freely onÂ» en
thusiast passed the remainder of the day
in jail.
Senator Denison took hold of Bayer's
ficht nnd marshaled every hack and
buggy that he couui find to bring voters
to the polls. Con Brosnahan, however,
did not intend to \Â»t the City Hall plum
which lie now holds siip from nis grasp,
and with his friends mudo an energetic
struggle to come out ahead.
With the li'tle exception of BaYney
Nolan going to prison for taking liberties
with Dan Harrington's features, every
thing wa3 quiet. _
Ate Lunch on the Church Steps.
The Fifth Ward is the home of Dr.
Buckland, F. M. Parcells and A. Fibnsh,
ali of whom were very strong candidates
for the Council. Evpry effort had been
made to induce Dr. Buckland, who is at
present a Councilman, to withdraw from
the fl^ht and. make the election of Par
cells, a Republican, su;e. and not split the
party vo;e, which would mean the elec
tion of Fibush, a Democrat. All three
candidates had lots of friends who were
eager in their interests, but the Fifth is a
very aristocratic ward, and the voters
neither challenge nor light but cast their
ballots with kid -loves, and so the day,
though lively, did not produce a single
incident so interesting as a street-corner
fight.
Miss M. Hill stood in the rain in front of
the First Presbyterian Church and dis
tributed anti-saioon tickets with a persist
ence that pu: many older workers to
shame. She staid at her post till the polls
closed, only sitting on the church steps
long enough to eat hÂ»*r lurich.
As Usual, In the Sixth.
The reputation of the Sixth Ward was
sustained, and in the Second [Precinct
there was the usual and expect-d
skirmish. Martin L. Marshall, a well
known politician, was asked by a Davie
man how the Mayor was running. Mar
shall's view did not suit the DÂ«vie man,
and the two were soon considerably mixed.
Marshall forced matters by striking the
man who dared to differ from him on the
nose, and when n police officer appeared
both men ran in different directions, leav
ing little carmine spots in their wake.
.This ward is the home of smiling Billy
VVatkinson, its present Councilman and
Billy, smiling and rotund as ever, rolled
arouud the ward from one precinct to
another doing excellent work on his own
behalf.
"Kid" Prince, without whom no election
woul i be complete, appeared at the Third
Precinct but was regarded with so much
doubt that he had to swear in his vote. In
the First Precinct everything r.as so quiet
that Officer Curtis requested the boys to
give hi m an occasional poke in the ribs to
keep him awake.
Solidity of the Seventh.
There seems to be hardly anything but
Republicans in the Seventh Ward. In
this ward lives Dr. Pardee, who has been
making a strong fight on behalf of the
leading candidate on the Republican
ticket. This is the great commuters' ward
and they lined up very early. The voters
who live and woric in this city very
thouetfully cleared the line so that the
commuters could cast their ballots and not
miss their usual trains to San Francisco.
Rarely has such courtesy ever been shown
during an exciting election and this fact
alone goes to show how nearly solid is the
Rei Ã¼blican spirit of the Seventh Ward.
Some enthusiastic anti-saloon people
circuinted a short letter during the day,
but the Sevent.i Ward is essentially a dis
trict of homes, and it was always expected
that it would give a majority in favor of
closing the saloons.
There was just one appearance of trou
ble over some election officers who were
not on the asses-ment-roil, but Colonel
Robert Jackson had anticipated this, and
was armed with an opinion from the Dis
tric Attorney that quickly restored peace.
The voting during the early hour^ of the
day had been so lively that after 3 o'clock
not 100 votes were cast, and the officers sat
around the aeserted polling-places wait
ing tor 5 o'clock, at which hour the polls
closed, and the fate of everybody was irre
vocably sealed in the ha. lot- boxes.

Auditor Snow's Speech on City
and County Consolidation
Creates D scussion,
Unity Rtqu red to Promote Harbor
Improvements and Annex
ation-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
'JOS Broadway, March 8. )
Within a few days there will be another
conference between all parties interested
as to the plans to be followed in bridging
the estuary. The two wooden structures
ar<j both in need of repair.
The Alice-street bridge is being strength
ened to last until something definite is de
cided upon, and the Webster-street bridge
is too narrow to permit of safe navigation,
as was proved yesterday afternoon.
The Board of Trade and Merchants' Ex
change are greatly interested in the
future of the harbor end at this time there
are many important matters, all rolating
to the harbor, that are in various stages
of progress.
There is the appropriation bill at Wash
ington that may or may not be signed be
fore next Saturday by President McKin
ley; there is the bridge matter; there is
the organization of a line of river boats
and the locating of the commission at
Adams' wharves; there is the necessity of
more wharfage and the greater necessity
of establishing a feeling of perfect har
mony between Oakland and Alameda re
garding recommendations to Wasuineton
a- to how National appropriations shall
be used.
In this same connection must be con
sidered the words of Auditor Snow, de
livered at the Exposition building Friday
night, and also the annexation proceed
ings now in progress in the northern part
of the city. Mr. Snow '-aid :
When the soverument of Oakland becomes
competent and rises to a dignified position
men will speak well of it ana the suburban
population will then desire admission to the
city. A consolidated city and couuiy govern
in* nt mus>t follow for the purpose of ecououiy.
Therefore a new City Hall at this time seems
to me illogical, uules-s we adnm that the de
sirabie conditions mentioned are imposslDle.
All these matters can only be adjusted
by unity, anil upon them depends the
progress of Oakland for the next twenty
years. A ft tidy of the situation clearly
shows that M r. Snow is right, and that the
only economical method of government i 3
by consolidation. Oakland, Alameia and
Berkeley are so thoroughly bound
toEether by a network of swift electric
roads that they are practically one large
town. Neither Alameda nor Berkeley has
a theater, ana the residents have to come
to Oakland. The improvement of the
harbor and the complet on of the tidal
canai are matters of equal .importance to
both Oakland and Alaraeda, and if the
northern territory shall decide to annex to
Oakland, this city and Berkeley would be
joined.
At the present time the cities of Oak
land, Alameda and Berkeley each maintain
expensive local governments, and besides
bear a large share of the expense of the
county government, which is also very
generously conducted, and there has been
an impression for tour years that consoli
dation would be of benefit to everybody.
Hitherto It has been considered too
eariy to take such a step, but now that
Auditor Snow, who has had eight years of
experience, assorts that the consolidation
must follow as a matter of economy, the
subject has been revived.

THREE PRIMARY TICKETS
They Are the Harmonic Hall,
Postal and Gocd Gov
ernment.
B y Burglars â Munhall Meetings-
Meeting of the City
Trustees.
ALAMEDA. Cal., March B.â The result
of the Good Governtment Club primary
on Saturday puts three ticlcets in tne field
for the municipal election to be held on
April 12 These are the Harmonic Hall,
postal primary and good-govern met tick
ets. In their selection, as already stated,
partisan politics cut no figure. There aro
several candidates who are on all three
tickets and whose calling and election
may therefore be considered measurably
certainâ that is unless some- independent
candidates should crop up apcl develop
unexpected strength. The candidates wno
are on all three tickets are : R. G. Wheeler,
for Treasurer; A. F. St. Sure, Recorder;
E. M. Smith, Assessor; B. F. Lam born,
Clerk, and Oscar Rogers, Marshal. The
Anti-Saloon League will not. put any
ticket in the field, though at one time it
was suggested that this might be .done.
They will concentrate t eir efforts upon
securing a majority for the proposition
which wiil be submitted to the voter?,
"Shall the traffic in intoxicating liquors
be prohibited?" This is for the purpose
of introducing the precinct local option
ordinance on the same lines as proposed
in Oakland.
Boy Burglars Released.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. March B.â The boy
burglars were brougnt before Justice Mor
ris this morning, when tue charges against
them were reduced to petty larceny, to
which they pleaded guilty. The Judge
gave them a good lecture and then sus
pended sentence and let them go home,
where it is reported a very warm recep
tion greeted them. Heuer, one of the
quartet arrested, was acquitted, it being
shown that he had nothing to do with the
thefts. It appears that it wan the ambi
tion of the young men to become "first
class safe-crackers," and they intended to
burglarize a jewelry-store and obtain
enough booty to buy a complete outfit of
tools, with which they were going into
business on a systematic scale.
NOT IN POLITICS.
President Rodger* of the Trades Union*
llakrn a Stiitnuipiit-
OAKLAND, Cal.. March 8 âPresident
Rodgera of the Alamecla County Federa
tion of Trades baa issued a statement in
which hÂ° contradicts an article published
in the Examiner yesterday morning and
signed by one F. J. Gregory. A few weeks
ago Mr. Gregory, who poses in his mind
as secretary of the Federated Trades of
Alameda County, also sent a long commu
nication to the Examiner, which was de
nied by the Federation of Trades.
The circular just issued is as iollows:
An article published in The Examiner of yes
ter-lay morning signed by F. j. Gregory seeks
to Impress the minds of people that ue U sec
retary of the Federated Trad, s of Alameda
County and that he speaks authoritatively for
that body. Mr. Gregory Is not the secretary
and is not connected with it in any manner
whatever. The impression be is trying to give
out that the federation is in politics is em
phatically denied, us no officer or member of
the federation has been approached by any
candidate for public r.ffice.
The fedori'.tion lias taken no action directly
or indirectly ntnl absolutely nb-tains from tak
ing part in p lineal camnaigns. In the forma
tion of the Municipal Union Labor League,
tbe federation took uo pÂ«ri as a central body,
while all the members did, as they hud a per
fect right to do. The federation recf'iÂ»nizes
that each individual has n right to ex-'reise
his right of citizeusnip without violating any
oblige tion he may owe to his union.

Crushed Uetween Caw.
OAKLAND, Cai.., March 8 âJames Mc-
Haie, a gnpman on the San Pab.'o avenue
cable-line, was crush'd between two cars
at First street and Broadway at 11 o'clock
to-i.i^nt. The grip on McHale's cur
caught in the slot and the car stopped on
the Southern Pacific track on First street.
He got the crew of a Telegraph-avenue
car to back up their car, with the inten
tion of having them pull his car clear of
the track.
He stood In front of his car with the
intention of coupling it to ihe electric ctr.
The latter came back faster than was in
tended and McHale was caught between
the two. Three of his ribs und his shoul
der blade were broken and he was injured
internally. He was taken to the Keceiv
ing Hospital. The accident blocked
traffic on Doth lines for half an hour.

SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENCE.
Reginald H. Webster Will Assume the
Duties of the Office "So-Day.
Reginald H. Webster will take posses
sion of the office of Superintendent of
Schools to-day and Mr. Babcock will step
out, the time covered by the stay in the
proceedings, five days, having elapsed.
With Mr. Babcock the Deputy Superin
tendent under Mr. Babcock's administra
tion as Superintendent will also go out.
Whether there will be any other changes
in the official force at the office of the
Board of. Education will develop a little
later.
Madison Babcock has not abandoned
the contest for the position 01 Superinten
dent. He is, however, of the opinion that
Mr. Webster's contention >o the effect
that, the Superior Court being 01 compe
tent jurisdiction, he (Webster) is entitled
to hold the position pendine the result of
proceedings on appeal to the Supreme
Court, is well grounded. Consequently
tnere will be no contention in tne new
City Hall about the matter.
The question concerning the position of
secietary, which is occupied by Charles
W. Welch, who was also appointed by Mr.
Backcock as Superintendent and con
firmed by the board, and also concerning
Dr. Kazan, who was appointed as a mem
ber of the board by Mr. Babcock, is the
next most interesting consideration. Mr.
Beanst n, the former secretary of the
board, maces no secret of the claim that
he is entitled to be censidered the secre
tary of the board. The q lestion appears
to b* whether the appointments made by
the Superintendent de fwc:o are legal.

A glance at the foregoing tables shows that
â between guardians, friends and families well
nigh 50 per cent of the boys are located where
they become self-supporting.
Bots trained to work at an early age are less
likely to become a burden on the State or to
themselves than those who begin the battle of
life later on. The former may not have as
much book learning as the latter, but it is a I
fact we I attested by experience, that they be- I
come ranch more successful and useful men in j
nearly every community.
Our boys do very well as a rule, in the
Country; and we are glad to be able to say that,
with very rare exceptions, they are treated
kindly by those who take them into their
homes. This is as it ought to be. They ara
"flesn of our flesh and bone of our bone."
children of the same common Father, born for
one and the same destiny.
The health of our children has been all we
could wisn during the year. Though going
out to school every day and mixing in with
the children of the district, they fortunately
escaped the many epidemics that have visited
our City and caused such fatal results among
the children ot all classes. Out of the 530
children who have made the directory their
home lor a shorter or longer period during the
year not a single death occurred.
The skill of our visiting physician, Dr.
Thomas L. Mahoney, was employed more in
preventing sickness than in healing the sick.
For the success achieved in this direction, he
has our sincere gratitude.
Though our dissenting brethren have, with
in the last two years, established numerous
homes for the waifs of their respective flocks,
more non-Catholic children have come under
our care during the past twelve months than
in any iormer year. They needed protection
and we took them in; they were hungry and
we gave them to eat without asking any ques- I
tions regarding their forms of belief or non
belief. We have many of these children in
the home at present and we find them worthy j
of all the assistance that can be afforded !
them. True charity. makes no discrimination
on account of race or creed. Enough for us if
we can help to make them law-abiding and
useful citizens.
More accommodations are needed If we mean
to hold our own. During the last half-year we
hr.ye been crowded to a degree that endan
gered the health of our community. More
room is now an absolute necessity. . >
Guardianship has been applied for and ob
tained in numerous instances since our last
annual report was rendered to the public.
Only in cases of dire necessity do we attempt
to take the control of children out of the
hands of their parents.
When obliged to do it, however, or to defend
our little wards from kidnapers, Attorney Matt
I. Sullivan never loses a case. From the press
ing demands of a large and lucrative practice
he gives to this work much of his valuable
time.
The ladies and gentlemen who made the fes
tival ot last fall euch a decided success are
â¢worthy of gratitude and praise. Their chief
reward, however, will come in a better world.
â¢ In concluding I desire to thank Mr. F. J.
Kane, the active and zealous secretary of the
Society for the Suppression of Vice, and Offi
cers Holbrook and McMurray.of- the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
These gentlemen are never sparing of their
services when duty or charity calls. The so
licitors of St. Joseph's Union, through a long
period of depression, have given ample evi
dence of their fidelity to the cause of the i.elp
. less poor. Their duty is not pleasant; yet
, the y perform it cheerfully for the sake of the
! Divine Master, who said": ''Suffer little chil
dren to come uno me, and forbid them not,
for of such is the kingdom of heaven." Re
spectfully submitted. D. O. Crowley.

SOON SALINAS WILL SEE ITS
GRAND BEET-SUGAR FACTORY
A Mammoth Enterprise That Means the Investment
of Two and a Half Million
Dollars.
CLAUS SPRECKELS' PLANS
FOR THE STATE.
Over Six Hundred Msn Will Be
Employed and Scores of Farm
ers Find a Market.
MONTEREY COUNTY WARMLY
INTERESTED.
E abbrate Scale of Buildingsâ A Great
Industry That Augurs Much
to California.
Although the time is not definitely
fixed it is not far removed when active
operations will be begun in the erection
of the great beet-sugar factory projected
by Claus t-preckels.
The citizens of Salinas and of the valley
at large keeniy appreciate the great im
portance of the mammoth undertaking j
proposed by Mr. Spreckels and feel that ;
â¢he future augurs substantial and perma
nent advantages from this enterprise, and
as the time draws npar to the realization of
the factory as an actual factor in their in
dustrial works they are still more im
pressed with its magnitude and its glow
ing promises.
It is no exaggeration to say that when
Mr. Spreckels' ambition is fully realized
and this stupendous plant is in operation J
General View of the Great Claus Spreckels Beet-Sugar Factory Soon to Be Built at Salinas.
[Draicn from the architect's drtigtit.]
it will result in an industrial revolution
in this section of the valley.
A cursory trlance at the plant as con
templated will convince any one that the
project, without its equal in the world, is
of immeasurable significance to the people
of Salinas Valley, and that they be quite
pardonable for their enthusiasm in con
templating its erection.
The factory will be picturesquely situ
ated, about fourand a half miles southeast
of Salinas City, on the banks of the Salinas
River. On three sides of it lie the great
plains of Salinas Valley, while imme
diately south and just across the Salinas
River Mount Toro commences its ascent
Irom the level valley and reaches an alti
tude of 3100 feet. Within the shadow of
this mountain tlie great buildings will rear
thefr forms.
The tir-t building met on approach to
thp grounds will be the office, a modern
brick structure 40x80 feet and two stories
high, wliere the Clerical force will be
hou el. Here also the beets to be crushed
will be weighed and accounted for. Pro
ceeding on the grounds in a southerly
direction one nex< comes to the beo't
sheds. These sh>-ds are rive in number,
separated by driveways, ami have each a
winhof 40 feet and a length of 804 feet,
inakirii.' a combined structure covering
KEW TO-DAY.
Most torturing and disfiguring of itching,
burning, scaly skin and scalp humors is in-
stantly relieved by a warm bath with Ccti-
ccra Soap, a single application of Cktiouba
(ointment), the great skin cure, and a full dose
of Clticuua Resolvent, greatest of blood
puriflera and humor cures, when all else fails.

nearly four acres of ground. In each
tLere are two tracks. Two trains can
enter any one shed and deposit beets in
the V-shaped bins, from which the beets
are immediately carried to the ditch
below, a cement-formed canal 18 inches in
width, and in it carried to the cleaning
house, from there to proceed to undergo
the many processes that finally convert
them into sugar.
To the north of these sheds there will be
provided cemented floors for dumping
beets, a measure contrived for the conve
nience of the farmers at the end of the
season, when the bins shall prove inade
quate, and an immediate removal of the
beet crop becomes necessary.
One hundred and fifty feet from the
sheds and to the south, one is brought
against the main buildings of the plant.
The principal building is a structure 106 x
686 leel, built of brick and live stone*
hich. with roof of slate. The extreme
height of this building is 130 feei. In
here there is a wilderness of machinery
almost beyond the power of description.
Machinery of the most ingenious typo,
evidencing the very latest attainments
and skill in the art of mechanism, and
the patents for much of which are exclu
sively controlled and owned by Mr.
Sprecltels. When this vast and compli
cated array of machinery is in motion, it
will crush d^ilv over 3000 tons of beets
and produc? 1,000,000 pounds of sugar.
This vast product is hauled by trains that
enter this building at the northeast cor
ner, there being two tracks for that pur
pose.
Separated from the principal building
py a track and distant to the east 24 feel
is the boiler and limekiln house. In this
house is developed the jireat power that
moves the machinery ot the plant and is
store i the lime used in the sugar-m.iking
process. Tiie dimensions of this building
is 65-\557 feet. From its roof will project
two steel smokestacks, with diameters of
16 feet ar.d a height of 200 feet.
Further toward the east and distant 24
feet with a trac& between is located the
building containing the storeroom, the
machine sbop, the blacksmith shop, tbe
piperoom and the carpenter's shop. Here
all contingencies, in the way of brenks,
wear and tear, are met, with the fullest
equipment to thorough and expeditious
work. This building has a width of 40
feet and a length of 400 feet.
Besides these buildings there will be a
warehouse 100x200 feet and innumerable
minor buiidinns. The inclosed site of the
factory will cover nn area oi 532 acres, and
is a p&rt of the 2500-acre tract owned by
Mr. Spreckels.
To place this mammoth concern in com
plete working operation will require at
least a year and a force of over 600 men
during this period of time. The operating
force of the* factory afier completion will
be between 600 and 700 men. Three miles
ol switches will be necessary to the traffic
of the yard.
The amount of water nccessarv to.sur
ply the demand of one day is 13,000,000
gallons, sufficient to supply a city of
100,000 inhabitants. Thut it will be seen
that the pumping p'aut incident to tuit
undertaking alone s quite an enterprise.
It was the question of water, so important
a factor, that led Mr. Spreckels io select
the present site of the factory. The water
supply is the Salinas River and artesian
wel's. Large pumps will lift the water
from the river to the factory. Across the
river, one half a mil* irom the factory Â«ite,
will be construftcl on the mountainside at
an elevation of 250 feet a re-ervoir capable
of boldine 1,000,000 gallons. The pur
poses of this are to supply the drinking
water and aff rd water in case, of tire.
Be ore tbe entire scheme is competled
and the details of this vust project are real
ized, and do doubt Mr. Spreckels will insist
upon thoroughness and completeness, the
sugar king will in all probab litv b com
pelled to draw his check ior $2,500,000,
"hich, with an investment of between
$700,000 and $800,000 in land, makes Mr.
Sprei kels quite a substantial holder in
Monterey County.
There will be distributed during the op
erating season $12,000 per day or beets
and $5000 per da? for labor and operating
expenses. It will require 30,000 acres of.
land to supply the demand Â>{ the fac ory.
Salinas Valley affords 90.000 acres for beet
Ci^'ivation.
Tne 30,000 under beet cultivation entail
an expense for labor and sped of $22 per
acre, in the aggregate $660.1.00. The same
land sown in grain would entail an ex
pense for seeu, labor, harvesting and
sucks of $fj 25 per acre, or a total of
$157,500.â a difference with some signifi
cance. An element further to be con
sidered in the problem of labor <s that in
hauling the grain crop one carries about
three-quarters of a tun per acre while with
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1597.
he oeet crop one has 12 ton 3to the acre.
Exp'-r.e id' aiso has ; ruveu tha alter use
o lanu for beei crops it is cleaner, and for
netter results are had in trowing grain.
The pulp from the f; ctory will feed and
fatten thousand* of head of c;ittle. The
yearly output of sugar in a five months'
campaign will be about 60.000 tons or
120,000000 pounds.
An approximate idea of the size of Mr.
Spreckels' new ambition can be had by a
comparison with he rest of the best sugaa
factor es in t c St.ite. The tnctory at
Watsonville has a cap.icitv of 1000 tons of
beets a day, the Ch no factory a capacity
ot 750 tons per day and the factory at Al
varado a ca ncity of 500 tons per day,
mating a total of ail the factories com
bined of 2250 tons per day or a capacity
snort of the rapacity of Mr. Spreckels'
new factory of 750 tons of beets per day.
With this prospect in view, it is quite
reasonable that the people of Salinas City
and the valley about it are spurred to a
degree of hiÂ»h expectation, and are lend
ing their full sympathies to this enter
prise, which promises so much for their
future; for, no doubt, aside from the
benefits derived from the establishment of
the factory itself, other industries will
spring up as a consequence of it, for the
valley is large, covering an area of 640,000
acres, with abundant natural resources,
rich and fertile in varied soil, with a cli
mate unmatcnable, but little known to
the tireat outside world, and with vast
tracts in it where even to this day the
only sound that is, beard is the cry of the
shepherd to his vagrant dog. The faith
of the peonle is solidly planted, the fac
tory is no experiment, and its projector
knows no such word as fnilure, and when
these propitiatory signs shall develop to
things real, Salinas Yal ley will owe its
progress and prosperity lo the indomitable
spirit and tireless energy of Claus
Spreckels.
OAKLEY'S FLIGHT
WAS UN IMPULSE
He Had Planned to Go to
Japan With His Wife
and Babj.
Money Was Sp?nt Like Water
While Journeying to
This City.
John M. Oakley's mad career across the
country in company with aa adventuress
that ended in his death at the Palace was
apparently not premeditated, but rather
the sudden impulse of a drink-soddened
brain.
It would seem that sitting ct home in
Pittsbur,: with his wife and little child
they had planned a journey to the Orient,
where he could gain mucii-needed rest.
They would go to the lan<i of the chrysan
themum and there, under the genial sun
of the Mikado's domain, dwell in the idle
luxury that the husband's wealth would
permit. They would make the journey
by easy stages, stopping where the fancy
seized them.
Oakley went so far in his plan as to get
a passport for himself, his wife and the
child. Then came the siren on the scene
and the pretty plan was shattered.
How she gained the mastery over Oak
ley will perhaps never be told, but she
gained it and instead of the peaceful and
respectable journey with his jvife and
baby lie whirled madly across the conti
nent in a perfect drencn of champagne.
Tlie artful adventuress may have known
of hi? intention of going to Japan, and
thus been able to more easily lend him, or
she may have lured him from his fire ide on
the spur of the moment, but one thing is
certain â she kt.ew he had mciey or she
would never have been his companion.
That she was to figure as his wile in the
Ori nt is proved by the fact that he had
engaged passage on the China steamer for
"Oakley and wife. 1 '
The Movy of his dizzy flicht is told by
the documents Coroner Hawkius was per
mitted by the Palace Hotel management
to see yesterday.
There was a letter of credit for Â£1000
drawn by Brown Bros. & Co. on B own,
Shipley <fc Co. of London. Apparently his
ready casb lasted until the woman had
landed him among her friends in New
Orleans, for it appears that the first
n mount charged against the letter was
Â£42 on February 23. This laÂ«t d but a
day. for on the 24th he drew Â£50 and on
theSOtli Â£60 more. Seven hundred and
fifty dollars went in a week, and then the
pair started for San Francisco, champagne
flowing like water all the way.
Arrived here there were more demands
for coin. On the Ist inst. he dreÂ«- Â£100
and on the 21 Â£40 more, nearly Â£700 in
all. Then death exhausted Oakley's letter
of credit, and the siren, bereft of the
source from which her puise was lined,
fled back over her trail of dishonor and
death, leaving her dupe to be carea for by
strangers.
The papers shown the Coroner con
sisted, in addition io the letter of credit,
of letters of introduction to Mrs. Britton
of Yokohama, Mrs. Dr. J. Baliard at Kobe,
and others.
The inquest on the case will be held
this morning at the Morgue, and Coroner
Hawlcins will make a great effor' to ascer
tain some;hing definite regarding the cir
cumstances surrounding OÂ»kley's death.
The manager and clerks, as wpi! as other
employes of the hotel, have been subpe
naed, and will be asked particularly re
garding the woman who accompanied
Oakley.
It is not thought probable that any i hiiSff
ARE FRIENDLY TO "THE CALL."
Paper-Hangers' and Carpenters' Unions Rescind
Resolutions That Were Passed Under
a Misapprehension.
(Wot copyrightedâ The Examiner is at liberty to republish.)
The following communications tell their own story:
San Francisco, March 8, 1897.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir : At the last meeting of
Carpenters' and Joiners' Union No. 304 certain statements
were made upon the strength of which the union passed
resolutions condemning The Call. We have since learned
that the statements made were unwarranted and mislead
ing, and at the meeting held this evening those resolutions
were rescinded, as this union does not wish to do an injus
tice to The Call, which has always been fair and impartial
in its dealings with the labor unions and workingmen.
WILLIAM JILGE,
President Carpenters and Joiners' Union No. 304.
San Francisco, March 8, 1897.
To the Editor of The Call â Sir: In a recent issue of
the Examiner a statement was published to the effect that
the Paper-hangers and Decorators' Union had at its last
meeting passed resolutions condemning The Call.
I am the president of this union and there never has
been a meeting of this body at which such resolutions were
passed, nor any resolutions condemning The Call. I
would have made this statement before had I seen the
report alluded to before to-day.
No one is authorized by the Paper-hangers and
Decorators' Union to use its name for the purpose of
injuring persons or businesses to gratify personal spite. I
feel confident in making this assertion that the union of

OAESOff PIGEON SHOOT.
Ned Fay I eninii an OrdÂ«r From
Stuart to Ship Birds.
Ned Fay, a prominent Jocal sportsman,
is of the opinion that there will not be a
pigeon shooting tournament held in Car
son in conjunction with the big prize-fight.
Mr. Fay said yesterday that he had re
ceived an order from Stuart to purchase
several dozen of the best, pigeons he.could
find in this City and ship them to Carson.
Fay nnswered back that the sportsmen of
San Francisco did not approve of a pigeon
tournament being held at Carson durine
the time in which prize-fighting will reign
supreme, and as a const-quence he recom
mended the postponement of the trap
shooting evmis until May or June, when
an event of the kind cm be carried off
successfully. Mr. F.y will not purchase
birds for the shoot until he receives an
answer to his letter. He adds that there
is a wide difference in the meaning of the
words sporting man and sportsman, and
that they do not travel hand in hand as
many peopie imagine.

THE BUILDING TRADES.
Very Little Work Now in the
Carpentering Line in This
City.
The Matter of the City Hall Marble
Work Laid Before the Stone
â  ! Cutters' Union.
Within the past week the assertion that
times in the carpentering trade are br.sK
and that the members of the craft are
nearly all busy has been repeated by sev
eral, and at last found its way into print.
The statement is not correct. To the con
trary, work is hard to obtain, and there
are far more men man there are jobs.
.At the meetings of the Carpenters and
Joiner*' Unions Nos. 304 and 483 last even
ing the matter was discussed and the
statements were made that the assertion
mentioned is misleading and injurious.
A large number of union carpenters are
out of employment.
They declare that if the rumor ranches
the outside world there will be a rush to
this City, which is now sadly overcrowded
with men who are involuntarily idle.
For example there are about 400 car
penters now in Carson, Nev. {should
i ese become mis ed and come to this
City in the expectation of obtaining em
ployment the situation would be more
embarrassing.'
â¢ A meeting of the Sandstone-cutters'
Union was held at 1159 Mission street and
a large representation was present. An
audience was given to a committee from
trie Marble Cutters and Polishers' Union,
consisting of J. T. McCann, M. J.Fla
herty and J. J. Hourigan. v . -.
The latter called attention to the marble
work now beinc done in the dome of the
City Hall. The committee stilted that its
union de-ires the ec -operation of the
Sandstone-cutters' Union in protesting
against the work that is being done on
that job.
The objection is to the nature of the
work bt>iue done there and the committee
asserted that it is not being performed ac
cording to tne plans and specifications as
called for in the contract. They â¢ further
asserted that the City Hall Commission
ers had been informed of the situation,
but mat these officials seem disposed not
to bother with tne matter.
The sandstone-cutters will consider the
subject at their next meeting.
Tne organization committee of the
Building Trades Council also appeared
and urged the union to affiliate with the
council. This, too,, will be decided at the
next meeting. In the meantime a com
mittee was appointed to look into the
proposition.

FOOP COFFEE.
WOULD LIKE
To Claim the Beuetit If True.
A gentleman stated (hat he had a gentle
running off at the bowels shortly afler
leaving off coffee and starting in the use
of Postum Cereal.
The makers would notobjecttoclaiming
so desirab c a feature lor Postum if the
claim could be sustained, for there is noth-
ing will do an old coffee drinker so much
good as a free action of that sort.
But unfortunately Postum cannot be de-
pended upon to proauce this result, as it is
composed only of grains, and has no effect
except as a very nourishing liquid iood.
The fact is that coffee tenu> to congest
the liver and prevent its free wondng.
Therefore if a coff c drinker will quit the
use of it, frequently the congestion will be
relieve ( and the accumulation of bile will
pass off and clean out the Dowels. Then
continue the use of Postum ami keep well.
It is a pure ood-drink and i-i nourishing
and fattening. A package can bj had

imitations of Postum Cereal Coffee if the
