Salisbury.
If the proposals of the Russian dfpio*
mats and German povernments made two j
weeks ago to blocs the ports 01 Greece j
had been acceded to by the English Pre- !
mier the dangerous developments of the
present time could cever have occurred, j
So the official ) apers in Berlin reason j
and Liberal politicians in fall sympathy j
with Greece think likewise. The aimul- ;
taneout presence of the allied squadrons j
in the PlijeiM. their control of :ue move- |
ments of Greek warships in the jKjean |
Sea and on the coa^t of Crete would have
restrained the popular demonstrations at
Atnecs and elsewhere, whicu have done
so much to force the hands of King
George's government.
There are those behind the scenes who
nay that from the outset of the Greco-
Cretan controversy the pretended partici
pation of the Salisbury Government bad
been abandoned, and that King George,
up to a late pofnt in the diplomatic con
test, was led to believe that eventually
the influence of Great Britain would
square the situation in favor of Greece.
Tnis it the plain language of well-in
formed papers like the Post and Kreuz
Zeitnng. In a recent cable dispatch it
was shown that family considerations
never had any weight with the
Kaiser, whose main aim was the main
tenance of the peace of Europe. But the
influence of the Danish royal family, with
its offshoots in England and Russia, is
known to hare bÂ»ea *t work, aad is be-
Jieved to have been operated with success
wnere least suspected. The Dowager
Czarina, who got credit for almost su
preme power in the Czar's councils, has
failed to alter the understanding between
the Kaiser and tbe Czar, although she has
had the active co-operation of Queen Vic
toria, who had strong sympathies with
Greece and an ardent detestation of the
Turks.
Neither the hand of tne ex-Czarina nor
that of tbe Queen can be made visible in
the game of diplomacy which is now be
in* played, but it is known that both have
been supporting Kinr George and it is
believed that to the Queen's inter.erence
much of U>rd Salisbury's hesitating pol
icy is due. That the Queen does still ex
ercise an oversight of foreign affairs is
perhaps better known at tne German court
than it is in England.
Meanwhile utter distrust in England is
the dominant feeling at the Foreisn Of
fice here, while tbe entente with Russia
is complete. But for Russia the Balkan
Peninsula would now be in a blaze and
Austria and Russia would be mobilizing
their troops for war. There is absolutely
reliable information that the three Bal
kan Statesâ Servia, Bulgaria and Monte
negro â have formed an alliance which ai

A naval officer sent the London Graphic a sketch of the firing of the first shot in the present crisis by thÂ« Greek warship Mianlis, which attacked a Turkish war
vessel. A Turkish dispatch boat with troops on bolrd Â«ailed out of the harbor of Candia, bnt the Miaulis was awaiting her outside. The Turk steered east along the
coast of Crete, with thÂ« Greek about half a mile astern. Matters proceeded thus until the Turk stopped off Sitia (a small village about fifty miles eastward of Candia), and
attempted to land her troopa. As soon as the Greek saw tnis she fired a gun across her bows, and two more, which went over her. The Turk, evidently thinking that

fects not only Turkey but the claims of
Greece and the aspirations of Russia.
The Prince of Montenegro was recently
at Belgrade holding private conferences
with King Alexander and the Servian
Minister and making arrangements for a
concerted movement of troops, and the
visit of the King of Servia to Sofia was
a result of Prince Nicholas' visit to Bel
grade.
Undoubtedly the whole of the triple
understanding is perfectly well known to
the Russian Government and was con
nived at, if not inspired, by Russia. Mon
tenegro is financed by Russia and jtÂ«ts her
armaments supplied or paid for chiefly by
the St Petersburg GoTernraent. Bervia,
iik^ Greece, has defaulted in her debt and
since the campaign against Bulgaria
which terminated with the Servian disas
ter at Slivnitza has made no inch progress

sian protection hare disappeared and the
entente has been achieved. It depends
upon Russia to let the dogs of war slip
from the leash. Up to the present time the
whore policy of the Czar is to restrain
them, and if they are let loose the pro*
found conviction is that the subsequent
embroilment of the powers will be largely
due to England's policy.
There :s not a shadow of foundation for
the current rumors that officers have left
or are Having Germany to take service in
the Turkish army. The few German offi
cers who are still in the Turkish service
are those who belonged to Count yon
Goltz's staff. There are two German offi
cers with Eiham Pasha at Monastir or
Eiassona who were with Yon Goitz and
some Germans who have seen service in
helping on the organization of the rediff
battalions in Salonica. Private letters re
ceived from these quarters state that
mobilization is only partial and proceeds
with great difficulty. Clothing ior tne
troops is badly needed, their provisions
are scanty and the commissariat is disor
ganized. Tiiere is also a scarcity of horses
for the artillery and things are generally
demoralized. The seizure of the moneys
in the banks of the provinces has helped
the authorities in providing for the troops,
but these resources wiil soon be exhausted.
Tne G-rman officers estimate me Turkish
effective forces at Eiassona, Monastir and
Jan>na with detachments close to the
Greek frontier at 77,000 men.

The Governments of England and
France have not as yet given their assent
to the proposal of the other powers to
make no reply to the answer of Greece to
tbe identical note of the European pow
er-, but make a forcible compliance with
the ultimatum of re powers. Thus tar,
it is learned only Germany and Austria
have accepted the Russian proposal to
put the blockade into 1 mined isle effect
and it is believed if tne other powers re

without reference to the attitude of the

LONDON, Â£>g., March 14.â Another
Radical manifestation to express sym
pathy with Greece in her effort in behalf ]
of Cretan Christians was held this after- ;
noon in Trafalgar square. At last San
day's" meeting in Hyde parr ' there were
20,000 persons present, and .to-day it was
estimated that the assemblage was fully
as large if not larger. * Greek 'flags were
numerously displayed, and many of the
persons comprising the : huge crowd : wore i
rosettes made of the national colors of
Greece.
Six platforms had been erected for the
use of the speakers, who included Michael
Davitt. Francis Charming, J. Havelock
Wilson and J. H. Daizeiii, all members of
the House of Commons, and several non
conformist ministers. The speakers main
tained the right of the Cretans to settle
their political differences themselves
without any intervention on the part ot
the powers and denounced Prime Mia
i-ter Salisbury for the part be has taken
in connection with Germany. Austria,
France and Italy to compel Greece to
abandon her attempts to liberate Crete
and to save the Christian population of
the island from Turkish misrule, oppres
sion and massacre.
The resolutions that were adopted amid
much enthusiasm indignantly protested
against the use of British forces to sup
press the laudible efforts of Greece in be
half of civilization and Christianity.
They also declared that the reply made
by the Hellenic Government to the pow
ers offered a satisfactory basis for a settle
ment of the whole question and urged the
Government not to subscribe to the policy
of coercion.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 14.â The
extraordinary tession of the Fifty-fifth
Congress, called by President McKinley,
meets to-morrow at noon. It is predicted
by leading members of Congress with
whom Tee Call correspondent talked to

of the tariff bill and the appropriation

bills that failed in tne last Congress by
reason of President Cleveland's failure to
sign them. The session will probably
last unlil July. All depends, however, j
upon the treatment of the Dingley bill
by tbe Finance Committee of the Senate.
The tariff bill will be reported to the |
House to-morrow by the Ways and Mear.3 '
Committee and it will bave passed tbat
body by April L
At any rate this is the programme of
House managers as stated to The Call
correspondent to-night. It is expected
that the Eenate committee will make a
good many changes, and the Senate, a
more deliberative body than tbe House,
will consume several weeks in the con
sideration of the bill. It is understood to
night tbat the immigration Dill, which
was vetoed by tbe President, will not be
brought up durinz this â â ession. It is
thought that the appropriation bills which
failed to receive Mr. Cleveland's approval,
will be passed through tbe House and
Senate in short order in the shape in which
they were agreed upon in conference com
mittee.
In the Senate will be seen twenty-one
new faces, the most conspicuous of the
new Senators will be Mark Hanna of
Ohio, Thomas C. Piatt, William E. Mason
of Illinois and Joseph B. Foraker.
Senator Spooner of Wisconsin is re
turned to the Senale after an absence of
six years. The faces that will be greatly
missed from the Senate are those ot David
B. Hill. John Sherman, Daniel W. Voor
hee.s the tall sycamore of tbe Wabash;
Joe Blackburn of Kentucky and tbe he
whiskered Peffer of Kansas. Mr. Sher
man was first elected to the Senate in
1861. Ha has served in that body for
thirty- two years, though not continuously.
Mr. Voorbees retires alter twenty years of
service in the Senate.
Out of 356 members of the House of Rep
resentatives 137 have never before served
in Congress. A familiar face will be that
of William S. Holman of Indiana, the vet
eran watchdog of the treasury. He has
served in Congress longer than any otber
living man. His service was continuous
with the exception of tbe Fiiiy-toarth
Congress, when he was defeated for re
election. One of tbe youngest-looting
men in the House will be Marion Devr.es
of California, who defeated Grove John
son.
Sockless Jerry Simpson will be on hand
again, after a retirement of two years. So
will Silver Dick Bland. One of the new
members, James R. Young of Philadel
phia, was formerly Washington corre
spodent of tbe Philadelphia Star. He
was executive cleric of tha United States

liant lawyer, will be one of the interesting

When Senator Davis' motion to refer
the treaty back to the committee was
discussed during the recent special session
there was a general expression of opinion
that the designation of the Judges of the
United States Supreme Court as members
of the tribunal should be eliminated. It
was thought that as jurists in the court of
last resort in this country the Judaea
might be called upon to pass on questions
eimilar to those that might arise under
this treaty of arbitration, and should this
prove to be the case the situation would
be more than embarrassing, as the opinion
of the Judge as a member of our own
court might act as an estoppel in the ex
ercise of his rights as an independent
member of the tribunal. It is almost cer
tain that the treaty will also be amended
along the lines of the Turpie amendment
of the last session, so as to provide that
every case or question intende i to be bud
mitted to arbitration under this treaty
should first be submitted to the Senate for
its ratification.
It seems to be a general impression that
when the Senator appointed by the Gov
ernor of Florida to succeed Mr. Call ar
rives he will be seated. The Legislature
of Florida does not convene until April 7,
and six years ago the Senate seated Mr.
Pasco ad interim under precisely similar
conditions.
The appointee from Oregon, in place ol
Mitchell, has not yet arrived. His claim
to a seat is regarded as res adjudicata by
the decision of the Senate in the Montana,
Washington and Wyoming cases in the
last Congress. His credentials will un
doubtedly De sent to the Committee on
Privileges and Elections, as were those of
Major A. T. Wood, the appointee of Gov
ernor Bradley of Kentucky.
Meanwhile the Republicans, in the mat
ter of organization of the committees, are
playing a waiting j:ame. They will make
no effort to do more than fill their own
vacancies until the Legislatures of thesa
two States elect. It is understood an
agreement has about been reached with
the Democrats to this end.
The proposition to consolidate all ele
ments opposed to the Republicans for the
purpose of capturing the organization and
the committees, appears to have fallen
through owing to the inability of these
elements to come together.
The Republican majority of the Hou^e
having adopted in caucus with unanimity
tbe old ticket, the organization of that
body will take but little time, but there is
no reason out-ide of his own possible de
sire for a day's longer time why the Presi
dent ahou;d not tend in his message to
Congress on the opening day â which is
rather an unusual happening. All the
House has to do after organization is to
draw for seats, and this can easily be done
while the joint committee is on the way
to the White HoUBe to notify the Presi
dent that the Fifty-fifth. Congress is ready
lor business.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 14.â
President McKinley has practically com
pleted his message to the Fifth-fifth Con
gress, but in view of ; the necessity sof the
organization *of the House before the
joint committee of the two houses can be
appointed to wait upon him and inform
him that Congress is ready to receive the
communication, it has been decided not
to undertake to send the message to Con
gress before Tuesday. While but little
time will probably be occupied in organ*
izing the House, the"greater part of j to
morrow afternoon will be necessary for
the drawing of seats by members. It is
expected the President's communication
will be Jaid before the respective houses
by 1 o'clock on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 14.â The
new tariff bill will be introduced in the
House to-morrow as soon as the organi
zation is perfected and will be referred to
; the Ways and Means Committee by whom
it was prepared. It is still incomplete.
The committee spent the better part of
to-day revising the schedules and this
work will be continued until to-morrow
noon. Many details require careful con
sideration and are liable to change at the
last moment.
The bill will be given to the press about
Â» noon on Monday. Chairman Dingley will
' furnish the press a statement which will
interpret the. various provisions of the
measure, explaining the material changes
' that have been made, their effect and the
- reasons which led to them.
' lt .'A" meeting of the â¢ full committee will
' doubtless be called for Tuesday, at which
". time the Democratic members who have
had no connection with the preparation
of the measure will be present Full com
â¢ mittee meetings will continue during the
â¢ remainder of the week in order that the
1 various schedules may be fully considered
'â  and an opportunity afforded the minority
of offering their amendments, which it is
' safe to assume will be promptly voted
down.
; it is Dingley' desire to report the bill
to the House the first of next week to
' have it passed through that ; body at the
earliest practicable moment. No satis
â¢ factory explanation has been given by the
committee as to why incomplete and in
accurate drafts of the proposed bill have
been permitted to be published.

--000 per annum. It introduced a bill mak
ing a horizontal reduction in the salaries
Assemblyman A. W. Kill of
Humboldt*
of public officials, employes and attaches
of all penal, reformatory and charitable
institutions of tbe State. That alone
will save toe State $110,000 per annum,
"Another bill we introduced was one to
abolish the Code Commission, which, if
passed, will cut off an unnecessary ex
pense of $16,000 per annum. We also
favorably recommended the bill which is
now a law limiting tae number of at
taches for subsequent Legislatures, and
which will save to the people about $25,000
for each session of the Legislature.
"ThÂ» Committee on Banks and Bank
ing has favorably recommended many
good banking laws and also killed many
ba 1 ones.
"The most important bills that came
from this committee amend the law per
taining to the Board of Bank Commis
sioners and make it easy for them to do
their work; 'also, a bill making banks dis
cover unclaimed deposits by publishing
each year a lint of all deposits which have
been unclaimed for the period of ten
years.
"One bill which I supported and for
which I received considerable criticism
from remote portions of the State was the
bill appropriating $300,000 to dredge the
Sacramento River. I have no regrets for
the actioa I have taken in regard to that
measure. It is not a steal, but, on tbe
contrary, one of the most needed im
provements that could be made.
"By deepening the river and making it
more navigable it insures reasonable
transportation rates to the people of the
valleys in sreneial and to Sacramentans in
particular. Without steamboat competi
tion I believe railroad rates would be ex
cessive and the people of Sacramento
would be at the mercy of a single corpora
tion. In addition to those benefits by
deepening the river and confining it
within its banks about 500,000 acres of land
would be reclaimed. This land is some of
the richest in the State and when re
claimed would add at least $50,000,000 to
the assessable property of this State,
thereby materially reducing the tax
rate.
"The appropriation may sliehtly raise
the tax ratfl for one or two years, but the
immense public benefits received will be
permanent apd increasing. And if the
L gislature will prune down tbe expenses
of some of its commissions and officers
ar.d abolish others it can save the amount
of that appropriation in one year."
STATE PRINTIXO OFFICB.
lircotnmmdalinni Made in the -Report of
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March U.â There
is much of interest in the report of the
two experts appointed to investigate the
affairs of the State printing office aa to
the way that institution is conducted and
the prices paid for material. The report
will be submitted to the joint investigate
me committee to-morrow. In view of the
fact that one of these experts, Frank Mal
ioye, is a Democrat set* cted by the minor
ity party of the Legislature, and that ho
agrees in every particular with Walter M.
Braunt, his Republican colleague, there
does not appear to have been any ground
for the many harsh criticisms of that in
stitution and the gentleman who is at its
head. Incidentally iome bard flings are
made at some of the State officials. But
tbe most valuable portion of the report is
that which suggests n number of import
ant improvements, which, if carried out,
will Â«ay*Â» to the State in the neighborhood
of $20,000 a year. The report begins as
follows:
We find no evidence of waste or extravagance
in me purchase of stock or the employment of
labor, at ihe present time. But. owing to the
limited time at our disposal, we have no means
of ascertaining to a certainly, if there has or
has not been any w iste or extravagance in the
past. There Is but one correct method to ascer
tain positive information on these points,
namely, by ascertaining tne amount of stock
on hand at a given period, Ray July 1. 1894,
then to ascertain the total amount purchased
for tbe use of the various departments, and the
amount of stock on hand at the present time;
also the value of the stock and labor entering
into tne unfinished work in process of manu
facture, tneu the value of labor and material
entering Into every jjb since July 1, 1894, to
date-
All points In this connection can be readily
had, and will appear fully in our report, ex
cept the estimated value or labor and stock
entering into the respective jobs, and this can
only be ascertained by figuring out the time
and stock necessary to complete each job as it

appears on the general and legislative order
books, which would involve labor of an in
definite time. If this were done a very close
estimate would be had of the exact status of
the department of Slate printing at ; the ' pres
ent time, and, even after the work was I com*;
pleted, there would still be a large margin to
dispute over, owing to the honest difference of
opinion as to the labor entering such work,
which f ct is clearly demonstrated every dRy
by the great discrepancies of different printing
establishments when tendering bids, lor work
in their line, required by merchants and man
ufacturers. --;,â¢'-,â . , < * U'
It being Impossible for us to go into the sub
ject thoroughly and ;do it properly, we de
cided it best 10 dial with the work intrusted
to us in a general manner and see if by. our
recommendations we could prove the meth
ods in vogue in some p irts of the establish
ment, and thereby save unnecessary expendi
ture existing under the present conditions.
c there tore i submit - for ; your ; consideration
this incomplete report, embodying die result
of our investigation and recommendation* as
to changes considered by â ; us:. necessary. The
composing-rooms were found to be clean, well
lighted ana well kept. On me occasion of our
visit, Ma en 9, we found all tiie- workmen to
be in their places before 8 o'clock, and at the
blowing of the whistle all hands started work
ing in the various branches. * ; :: .:â :â "-"'â 
A great saving has been made the present
session by changing the files and histories
from the bulky, awkward size, formerly r. in
use, to the present convenient form. -â '.. "â -;,' .-â â¢ â â â 
After detailing a number of important
improvements that have been made under
the administration of State Printer John
stun, the report concludes as follows: A. '
The pressroom at the time of our several vis
its was found to be in good order. The presses
were clear of â  superfluous oil. The paint on
the frames appeared to have been recently ap
plied and the un pain ted -..arts of the ma
chinery were bright and: dean. - The bindery
was found to be well arranged, clean and well
kept. The change from the third to second
floor has made a gain of 5825 square feet. â  â â â¢
All bindery work done con. aiueJ the best
materials. â  Strength -and â  neatness were ap
parent in the mechanical; portion, especially
of the textbook!-, and the work will compare
favorably With books of similar character exe
cuted in any part of the United States. In the
electrotype department is located a complete
and will-kept plant for all electrotype and
stereotype work required in the State Printing
Office. .. -ivT ".A -.:.... Âv. --:?: â ^-â Â. ; "
There is considerable waste in the engineers'
department, not, however, through any mult
of the engineer In charge, but the waste is ow
Ing to the change from ail steam power to part
steam and part electric power lor; operating
the machinery, heating* the building and the
heating of some presses' where heat is re
quired. The State 'is now paying for electric
power that should be utilized to operate every
thing inside and outside the â  building that re
qu res power, including the elevator. â  - i
We think tho price paid fur electric power Is
excessive, and v. ould suggest that when the
present contract expires a motor be purchased
and the lowest rate lor power be procured.
The general order-book at the printing office
is well kept, showing in detail the items of ex
pense and the cost of each order executed' for
the State departments. The other books nec
essary in an institution of this character are
all that be uesired. ;In addition a system of
time is kept upon every employe of the com
posing and press rooms. '
On examination of the order-book we noticed
many items " of . lithographed and embossed
office â  stationery which nad been", procured
from outside firms. Tnls work is expensive,
and as it is impracticable for the State to put
in a* lithographing and, embossing plant we
recommend that, so far as possible, the heads
of the State departments confine their desires
for fancy stationery to work that can be per
formed at the State Printing Office.
Several typewritten pages are devoted to
giving the prices paid for various supplies
used in the State Printing Office. Com
menting on these the report says: * ~
All the foregoing rates we consider reason
able, and the quotations for paper and card
stock and envelopes are lower than current
prices in the open market.
The more important of . the recommen
dations contained in the report are as fol
lows: ':- : ; :*â â¢;â  â -' ' r -â 'â¢'â  "'' '' p â  -'â -â â  ;
â¢ Grade the salaries of females employed in
the bindery. as to ability: use time .tags, for
employes of the bindery similar to those used
in composition and press rooms; electrotype
all matter needed for future publication; in
troduce a type-casting machine; put in mod-'
crn elevator; obtain -all power required; by
elevator and plan from i electric motor; use
smaller boiler to obtain steam for heating; at
tach meter to electric motor and get lower rate
lor electricity; Induce heads of State depart
ments to use stationery that can be executed
in State printing office, instead of expensive
liihogrxphing and stamping; induce the Sen
ale and Assembly to employ sufficient clerical
force at the Secretary's desk to transmit copy,
to the printing office without loss of time; dis
continue author's correction on proof. ; ,". l
â â  In conclusion, the experts say : â â  â¢ . .. r- ,
If the foregoing recommendations are
adopted and' Droperlv enforced, we -estimate
that a savin* of from $15,000 to $20,000 per
year will accrue to the State.
IN THE INTEREST OF SCIENCE.
Important Expedition to Be Sent to North
eastern Asia and Northwestern
America.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 14.âDe
tails concerning the expedition to be sent
to Northeastern Asia and Northwestern
America show that it promises te be ihe
most important to modern science since
the days of Livingstone and Stanley.
Morris Jessup, president of the Ameri
can Museum of Natural History of New
York, is the originator of the expedition
and will pay all the bilis connected with
it, which during the s>x years of its con
tinuance will reach considerably over $50,
--000. Professor F. W. Putnam of Cam
bridge, who is curator of the antbropo
losical department of tbe American Mu
seum and also of the Peabody Museum at
Hatvard, has tbe eeneral direction of tbe
expedition, but his work here prevents
him ironi going himself.
Tne principal point to be determined by
the expedition is whether or not the pri
meval American Indians and Esquimaux
came irurn Asia originally. This is a ques
tion of tbe greatest importance to the
ethnologist, and has been superficially
treated by many writers, w o hold that
tbe American race is very closely allied to
the Mongolian. The expedition which
will undertake to solve t is problem will
be in two parts, one to go to Asia, the
other to investigate the American side.
The latter section will start about the
first of May, with British Columbia for its
first objective point. Dr. Franz Boas has
oeen chosen to lead this party on account
of his long-continued investigations in
that vicinity, his wide knowledge of eth
nology and his special attainments.
His chief assistant will be Harlan I.
Smith of New York City. With them will
go several specialists In various branches
of research.
The Asiatic branch of the expedition
will not start from this country until Sep
tember, and its leader has yet to bo se
lected.
Tbe collections to be made by the ex
pedition will all linit their way to the
American Museum of Natural History in
New York City, and will make the insti
tution the center of interest to tbe world's
anthropologists and ethnologist for
many years, until the problems they il
lustrate shall have been satisfactorily
settled.

In Impotent Fury He Continues His

HAVANA, Cuba, via Key West, Fia.,
March 11â General Melquise, who was
responsible for the Delgado and many
other atrocities in Pinar del Rio province,
resent ul at not being promoted for his
"heroic" deed*, has decided to return to
Spain, and on the sick plea, it is said, will
sail on the 20th. General Selano will also
leave on the same date.
It is reported that Colonel Net-tor Aran
guren, the Cuban leader who captured
t a Spanish officers on the Guanabacoa
train some time ago, has been summoned
to General Gomez' presence to explain
the reason why he released them without
waiting lor orders.
Colonel Tort of the Civil Guards, who
was in command of Guinea when the
rebels entered the town, has been indicted
on the charge of neglect of duty and
cowardice and will soon be courtmartiaied.
Further details of the attack on Bejucal
have been received. The outrages com
mitted there were horrible. Many resi
dents, men and women, perished. The
official report simply states that it was an
attack on one of the forts and was suc
cessful, the rebels being repulsed with
great losses.
Persons moving In military circles are
authority for the statement thatWeyler has
received a telegram from Spain inquiring
about the Guinea affair, which was not re
ported officially. Weyier gave an evasive
reply and tried to diminish its importance,
at the same time announcing his deter
ruination to leave for the field the follow
ing day. He was ordered to remain and
await further orders.
Secret orders have been given by Weyier
that whenever an attack is made on a
town or city all the female residents, on
the simple suspicion of having connection
with the insurgents, shall also be arrested
as enemies of Spain. They will be sub
jected to court-martial and deportation.
This order had already been carried into
effect, for on the day following the entry
of rebels into a town nine women, with
fifteen children, the majority of the latter
babies, were arrested and brought to Ha
vana.
Persons visiting the palace Thursday
night were shocked at tie sight of poor,
forlorn beings, all huddled on the floor of
one of the corridors with their babies in
their arms, all crying for want of food,
they having been deprived of nourish
ment or drink during the whole day.
Even the volunteers on duty at the palace
were moved to compassion, and all were
indignant at such cruel treatment of help
less women. From the palace orders were
given to send them all to the Casa de
Hogidas, or house of refuge for degraded
women, and later on to be banished to
Puerto Principe.

Elaborate Prcject of Warden French for a
Spiendid Modern Penitentiary at
Fort Lean n worth.
WICHITA, Kans., March 14.â Captain
J. W. F ench, warden ol tue Federal
prison at Fort Leavenworth, is the author
of a project to utilize ihe 500 convicts
now under his control in building a sp en
did modern penitentiary for the housing
of the selfsame men, near the site of the
present old-fasmoned and inadequate
structure where they are at present cou
fined. ,
"Congress haÂ« appropriated $150,000 for
the work," said the warden in a recent in
terview, "the plans have been prepared
and they are only awaiting tiie approval
of the Department of Justice. But we ex
pect with this sum to ouild an institution
that would represent an outlay ot >ww.Â«
000. The land, ol course, is iree, being a
Government reservation set apart m Â»Â«â 
Ou the reservation we also hayÂ» inex
haustible quarries of nne bui ding stone,
lime in abundance and the huest ol clay
for making brick. The convict- will
quarry and dress the stone, make the
bricks, burn the lime and prepare the
structural material in the prison shops.
"When the ouiidiug is done it will repre
sent the newest and best ideas in that
class of architecture. Tnere will be at
least ten gooÂ»i-sized rooms to be devoted
to nigut kcuoos for the men, a firat-ciasa
fcyui'iasiuin, baths and the like, to be used
by those who merit good treatment.
"Tue majority of the meu sent to U3
come from Arkansas, Texas and the In
dian Territory. Criminals from the sec
tions are usually of me frontier type, and
as a rule are easier to reclaim than those
who have been raised in t c oÂ»der and
more settled communities, and who have
developed into evil-doers from innate de
pravity. The latter have hud all chances
to bee mo honorable citizen*, and have
deiberately chosen to be vicious. The
lax standards of border settlements are
o.ten the cause of moral obliquity, but as
a general thing the border man who be
comes a convict is readier to listen to ap
pea.s to his reason and conscience and
maÂ«es more earnest efforts to reform.
Tue re Is in him always a slumbering
spark of manhood, and his cuance of ref
ormation is much superior to that of his
more intelligent but more depraved col
league.
"The central idea in modern penal in
stitutions is founded on the humane prin
ciple to improve the condition of the
inmates and to endeavor to tit them for
respectable living after regaining their
liberty. At Fort Leavenworth we have
abolished the lo k steps and the striped
clothes. A few may wear stripes, bat only
for an infraction of prison discipline.
Shaved heads are also no longer in vogue,
but a man may have all these things put
on him if be persists in violating the rules.
Very few of those in my charge do so. At
least 80 per cent of them are perfectly
amenable to the law of the place. There
are men there that I would trust with all
my property, or with my life.
"Ihe greatest, reform in the manage
ment of convicts would be to make their
terms of imprisonment indefinite, so that
instead of "doing" a fixed time in involun
tary confinement, a man would be allowed
freedom at the earliest moment he was
capable of returning to society. This
would eliminate from the case ail idea of
vmdictiveness, and punishment should
never be vindictive."

Reports of Wonderful Discoveries of Gold

Mountain*.
WICHITA, Kans., March 14.âOkla
homa is in a fever of excitement oyer the
report ttiat both "cold and silver in paying
quantities have been discovered in the
Wichita Mountains, in the Indian Terri
tory, and companies of prospectors are
secretly forming in Kingfisher, Â£1 Reno
and a number of other Oklahoma towns
with the intention of opening up mines
immediately. These reports of rich finds
ox gold In the Wichita range of mountains
ere becoming so frequent and the samples
of the pannings and the different assays
that have been made afford such tangible
proof of the oft- reiterated statement that
the mountains are full of gold that the
prospectors have forgotten their fear of
Federal authority ana are determined to
nunt for the precious ore even at the risk
of their lives.
The Indian police and the Government
troops are kept. busy ejecting miners from
the mountains,* but despite their vigilance
it is stated on good authority that at the
present time there are 1000 men in the
Wichita Mountains who bide in caves and
canyons when the soldiers appear but
proceed with their operations when the
coast is clear.
There is a growing belief among pros
pectors that there is a scope of mineral
land fifty miles in width and twenty miles
in br adtu in these mountains that is mlly
as rich as any gold mines in this country,
and such men as Professor Andrews, a
veteran prospector, declaro that the
Wichita Mountains will within a year be
the scene of a gold excitement as great as
v.as witnessed in California in 1849.

to the Clerical and Anti-Semite parties.
The Socialists are not gaining as they ex
pected, not even in the industrial districts
of Bohemia and Galicia. The German
Liberals are losing ground, and it is
clearly evident that the Badeni Cabinet
will get their majority in members drawn
from the feudal aristocracy and represen
tatives of the Clerical and Anti-Semite
sections. The new Reich-rath will be
what Liberals call a reactionary body.

KINETOSCCP3 FOUND TO WOBK
ON A CLOUDY DAY.
The Battle Could Be Photographed
Though tbe Son Were Hidden
From View.
CARSON, Niv., March 11â When Car
son awoke this morning she was greeted
by a leaden and ominous sky. Groans at
once took the place of tbe expressions of
joy that had been aronsed by the past
few days of delightful weather. Dan Stu
art frowned and looked gloomy enough
when he came out of his apartments and
noticed the forebodings; but his troubles
were nowhere to be compared with tbose
of the kinetoscope pi-ople. They fairly
roared with rage. And it is no wonder;
for these folks have gone to an expense
already amounting to nearly $30,000, and
it has been their plaint all along that un
less the 17th was a clear day all this would
be lost. Dan Smart's fat share of this
kinetoscope privilege would also evap
orate. The latter fact certainly acCounts
ior the popular Texan's frown and gloomy
look this morning.
.But there came to-night a happy little
turn in affairs, which had the effect of il
luminating the countenances of all con
cerned with happy and confident smiles.
The weather did not assume a more pro
pitious aspect â not at all, for those moist
and threatening clonus clung to tbe in
verted bowl all day. Something else hap
pened. The Kinetoscope crew, having be
come desperate, determined to ascertain
,by experiment just where they stood, so
to speak. They bundled up their ap
paratus and hied themselves to the arena.
Everything was put into position, just
as if the battle for the world's champion
ship was to be fought, and at a given sig
nal several members of the outfit climbed
npon the platform where the ring is to
be located and began to execuie a sort of
imitation of a Piute ghost â lance Simul
taneous with their debut came a whirring
and buzzing noise from the interior of tbe
stilted box wherein was located the mys
terious device which takes sixty photo
graphs a second.
The hopping around performance on
the platform continued for three minutes
â the allotted time for one-round of fight
ing under the Marquis of Queensberry
rales, â¢ "Time," rang out a voice from the
interior of the box. The whirring sound
ceased and the dancers stopped for a rest.
Then " they had another three-minute
round and another and another. So far as
the machinery worked everything was
perfection. The ghost dancers were com
plimented for their endurance and the ex
periment was over.
But the most important feature of the
entire affair â the item that was to deter
mine the winning or losing of a small
fortune â wis yet a mystery. The question
was, Had clear negatives been received
under such a frowning and murky sky?
The rilins were taken away to the syndi
cate's laboratory and put through the se
vere chemical process.
An hour later the negatives had been
developed, and it was found that the
amateur Indian dancers had been re
produced as plainly aud distinctly as ll
the sun had been shining its brightest.
A shout of joy went up from the
kinetoscope contingent, for this experi
ment proved something that had never
been -known before â that kinetoscope
negatives could be successfully taken on a
cloudy day.
Stories have been flying around for
some time to the effect that in the event
that St. Patrick's day came in cloudy and
threatening the big tic lit would be post
poned in order to accommodate tbe
kinetoscope concession. Indeed, I have
been informed on the very best of author
ity that the programme agreed upon be
tween the tighi promoters and the syndi
cate was that if the 17th was unpropitious
th.c two imaller contests â Smith against
Green and Flaherty against Hawkins â
would be substituted and the chief event
would take piace the following day if 'he
sun shone. But to-day's happy experi
ment precludes all this, and now tne
original programme will be carried
through to tbe letter.
Corbett and Fitzsimmons will beein to
maul each other at 11 o'clock Wednesday
morning and the other two tights will
take place on the following day. The
big pigeon-shooting tournament will be
inaugurated on the afternoon of March
17, immediately after the world's cham
pionship battle is finished, and will be
continned during the next day and until
the championship at this game is settled,
too. The cowboy tournament is scheduled
for Tuesday; so there is the whole Carson
carnival programme.
Tbe last obstacle which threatened the
consummation of the match between Cor
bett and Fitzsimmons was removed to-day,
when the Cornishman came into town
and announced that be would offer no
further objections to the clause incor
porated in Keferee Siler'a rules permitting
bitting in the clinches and in the break
aways. Bob declared yesterday that he
would not stand by Manager Julian's ac
ceptance of the rules as they had been
published and threatened to make trouble
on tbe day of tbe fight, but after sleeping
ewer the matter he has decided to take
things as they come and makes the re
mark that ha "will Jick that big fellow
anyway."
Those who know Fitzsimmons well still
persist in doubting that be ever seriously
intended to raise a row over this rule, be
cause they believe, down in their hearts,
that he would rather prefer to punch in
the clinches, but that he wanted to lead
Managers of the Big Fighters Agreeing to the Rules as Announced by Referee Siler.
Corbett into believing that he was a
novice at this particular game, thus im
proving his opportunities for openingÃ.
Fitzsimmons was always superb at close
range work and at in- fighting, and it does
not stand to reason that he has forgotten
any of those clever tricks.
Dan Stuart is the happiest man in town
in consequence of Fitzsimmons' decision,
and he has a right to be, for there is now
not another stumbling-block left in the
way of the fight of the century. Nothing
outside of a volcanic eruption or some
thing equally unusual can stop the car
nival.
Neither Corbett nor Fitzsimmons did
much work to-day â not because it was tbe
Sabbath, particularly, but because their
respective trainers have decreed that they
have done enough violent exercise and
must indulge in light work only from now
until Wednesday. Fitzsimmons really
did nothing. In the forenoon he waited
in from Cook's ranch as far as the State
penitentiary, took a bath there and then
attended the regular Sunday religious ser
vices beld at tbe prison.
It is understood that another "exclu
sive" scheme was on foot to-day. It was
to have Corbett and FUzsimir.ons meet at
the prison and indulge in another spec
tacular quarrel, such as <8 alleged to have
taken piace last week. For some reason
it fell through. The story is that Corbett
declined to be cast in the farce. After
Fitzsimmons had waited at the big stctie
structure for at least a half hour after the
services, and no Corbett hove into view,
he returned to his training quarters and
took things easy. This afternoon he and
his wife drove into town for their mail and
to do a little shopping, and that ended the
day.
Corbett was not quite so idle, but still
did not extend himself at any time during
the day. A great crowd of visitors flocked
in and out of tbe Springs from early
morning until late to-night. Big Jim
received everybody pleasantly, chatted
with tbe lady callers and told his visitors
over and over again bow well be felt and
bow confident he was of coming out vic
torious in bis battle with the Cornishraan.
Instead of taking his usual road run
this morning, Corbatt's trainers shifted
the programme and had him do his bag
punching, boxing and other indoor exer
cise instead, leaving the road work for the
afternoon.
"We do this to prevent him from feel
ing the monotony of the work," Trainer
Charley White explained to me this after
noon. ''Billy Deianey and I agreed that
Jim's long siege of violent exercise was
liable to do him barm if it got distasteful
to him, and that's why we changed the
routine. Tbe big fellow's hard work is all
over now. He had his last real work-out
yesterday. We pro Dose to keep him down
to the lightest kind of exercise now until
the day of the fight. He will only get
enough to keep his wind good and pre
vent him from going back. He could not
be bet; er than he is now if he should train
for a hundred years. He is in magnifi
cent shape. To be more emphatic, I will
say right here that I will stake my repu
tation as a trainer that no man ever
stepped into a ring in better condition
than Jim Corbett is right now. Tnat is
saying a whole, lot, I know, but I mean
every word of it. He is tit to fight a bat
tle ol fifty or 100 rounds If necessary, or to
enter into a short and furious contest. It
will make no difference to Jim what sort
of a pace Fiiz cuts out, as he will ba with
him. And if Bob sees fit to lay back and
let Jim chalk out the programme, our
protege will be all the more pleased. He
has the whole thing cut and dried for
such an emergency, and Mr. Filzsimmom
will find it out to his sorrow."
Corbett will be allowed about an hour
on tbe road to-morrow morning and
about tue same amount of time for his
afternoon work. On Tuesday he will get
even less, probably doing nothing in the
afternoon and that will be tbe last work
of any kind, as the fight of his life takes
place on tbe morning of tbe following
day.
Stakeholder Al Smith, Billy Madden
and William Muldoon all went out to
Cook's ranch to-day to see Fitzjimruons,
but as the Cornishman did not strip for
any work they did not have an oppor
tunity to size up his physical condition as
thoroughly as they desired.
"Judging from all outward indica
tions," said Smith to-night, "Bob is in
first-class condition. He has a healthy
complexion, bis eyes are clear and his
movements indicate vitality and agility.
I am sorry I did not get a chance to see
bim at bis work, for then I could form a
better opinion. But then Fitz is never
out of condition and it is safe to say that
be is fit to fight for his life. This will
certainly be the battle of tbe age and
worth going thousands of miles to see."
H uldoon, although on tkÂ« 'exclusive"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
list, did permit himself to confide to sev
eral outlawed press that
he considered that the Cornishman had
trained faithfully. But to a friend Mul
doon afterward whispered that he had ex
pected to see Bob looking bigger and more
brawny than he is. He intimated that, in
hit opinion, Fitzsimmons had been wor
rying a little.
Billy Madden liked Fitzsimmons' ap
pearance. He said to-night that he con
sidered tbe Janky fellow in excellent trim.
"With these two big fellows in tbe su
perb shape I find them," he said, "I am
satisfied tuat the greatest fight ever wit
nessed will take place on the 17th. It is
very apt to be a hurricane affair. You
see Jim and Bob don'tlike each other and
are more than liable to begin heavy hos
tilities the moment they face each other.
It would be a pity to bave the fight ended
in one or two rounds, and yet no one can
say that that will not be the result."
Madden intends to remain on the Pa
cific Coast for several week?. He will go
to San Francisco immediately after the
Carson carnival i* over. He hopes to get
a match for Joe Goddard with tbe winner
of tbe Corbett-Fitziimmons contest, but
has other tails to bis kite, whether be suc
ceeds in this or not. He has Steve O'Don
nell on his staff, and is anxious to match
him against J ffries, Greggains or some
other coast heavyweight. His chanoes to
secure Jeffries are rather slim, as Corbett
has fallen in love with the big fellow from
the southern citrus belt, and, if he whips
Fitzsimmons, will take Mm East as his
sparring partner, a. fight between O'Don
nell and Greggains would be a drawing
card anywhere. I understood that Billy
Kennedy of tbe Olympic Club bas bis
eagle eye on tnis match and wants to talk
business with Midden.
A great crowd of strangers arrived in
Carson on, to-day's trains, most of them
being Eastern sporting men. The influx
will go on increasing now until Wednes
day. Among the arrivals from San Krati
cisco were: Jim Nealon, the handball
champion; Jim Flynn of the Olympic
Club and Fred Graham, the well-known
horseman and athlete. Graham has a
wad of money to bet on his old friend
Corbett He has just come ovar from
Grass Valley and Nevada City, where there
are lots of Corninhmen, who bet even
money that Fitzsimmons will win. He
gathered in a number of these bets.

THE SHAME OF CARSON.
The St. Patrick's day convention has adopted resolutions condemning the dese
cration of the Irish national festival by the proposed exhibition of brutality at Carson
next Wednesday. Nothing less could be expected from that convention, which repre
sents all the Irish societies in this City. Decency demanded it. Patriotism made it
imperative.
No one who has studied the tactics of the prize-fighters can doubt that tbe day
was selected to stir up a certain feeling and thus to draw more visitors to the rine and
more money from the pockets of fools. The real manipulators kept themselves well
in the background and a crowd of sports with so-called Irish names were shoved to
the front to give the affair a Hibernian appearance. The resolutions of the united
societies tear away this pretense and the fight is now seen in its true light as a money
making speculation by men to whom considerations of honor, of morality, of patriot
ism are all subordinated to considerations of pelf. Every race, every nationality hai
its degenerates. We can no more help their existence than we can help the
existence of excretions in living bodies. They are a necessity of nature, tbe dregs in
which the vices of tbe people ran off. But we can see to it that these degenerates
shall not pretend to represent tbe race they befoul. We can see to it that the world
will know them for what they are worth, the ragtail and bobtail of the community.
We can see to it that they shall not have the opportunity to further dishonor a people
whose greatest reproach is that they belong to it. The Irish societies have made their
position claar. The decent Irishmen of this town repudiate with all their hearts,
with all their minds, with all their souls, with all their strength the scandal at Carson.
The newspapers tell as in great detail how one of the pugilists went to mass and
another led in the singing of Methodist hymns. During years and years of their
obscurity they never think of darkening a church door; but now that their every
movement is chronicled they must, like an ill-mannered dog, rub their dirty hides
against the skirts of that institution whose shame, whose only shame they are.
Breaking every law she has made, they blacken her before the eyes of tbe public by
entering her doors. We will not determine whether they are driven by Pharisaism
or by superstition; probably there is an admixture of both. However, we have done
our duty. We have made it clear that the Irish on tbe coast have neither band, act
nor part in the performance. It will oe attended irom all over the country by tbe
modern Goths and Vandals wnoae existence is a peril to society. It is a shame that
a sovereign State could so lower itself before the world as to become an asylum
for those compared to whom the banditti of Romulus and Remus were immaculate
and of untÂ«rni?hÂ«d honor.â The Monitor.
Jim." asked Corbett, as he prepared for
his rub-down. "You and I have played
marbles together, you know, and I would
go more on your judgment than on any
body's. Speak riant out in meeting, old
man, and let us have your honest opin
ion."
"Well Jim," replied Nealon, "what I
have just seen lifts a load from my mind.
You did look kind df jaundic-d when you
left home, and although 1 would not have
said Â»o for the world, I thought you were
a bit foggy. I knew I oou!d pick the win
ner of this fight after I had watched you
box a few rounds and bad a good look at
you when the bout was over. If you aint
fit to-day to figbt for your lite, then I don't
know you, that's all. You look bigger,
work laster and blow less after exertion
this minute than I ever knew yon to do
before. You need not think you are able
to beat me at handball though. I'll take
that conceit out of you to-morrow."
The other members of the party agreed
with Neaion that Corbett was ripo for a
championship battle.
Captain Hinds, superintendent of the
P.nkenon detective agency at San Fran
cisco, who will have charge of tbe police
arrangements at the riugside. was among
the arrivais to-day. With Him came Bol
ton Rogers, ex-chief of poiice of Seattle,
Wash.; M. J. Conway of Ci.icago, and a

utations. Twenty picked men, selected

talk concerning the big fight is as volumi
nous as ever. All the sports who had any
intention of seeing . the mill are now on
their way to Carson. Opinions as to who
will win are still at variance, but the
betting seems to be a shade in favor of
Corbett.
Filzsimmons' stronghold seams to be on
the West Side, where Peter Maher is pop
ular. ; The majority of the , Irishman's
friends contend that if Fitznimmons can
whip Maher so easily he ought to do the
trick when he faces Corbett. Jim Burns
is one of Fitzsimmons' ardent supporters
in, ; this .section of town. He' has over
$5000 already wagered on Bob, and if the
latter looses he will, he says, go "clean
broke." $)/.. â  â  'â  â  â -â â  : : ; â [-- I. ; â .:'â  -
. The v fact that Billy. Edwards is now
placing his friends' money on Fitzsim
mons, is looked upon as a good omen by
the Cornisbman's supporters. They figure
that this is a sure sign that the. Corbett
people are : trying ._> to % hedge. Edwards
would â¢ not say, when asked yesterday, if
he intended to place any of his own money
on Corbett. . â "â .â .â¢.'.'. ''i,:-': : :>â '.','â 'â  â â 'â â â â '.'â  '.. ->"-*-:;
"The cash I have placed on the probable
result up to date,' he â¢ said, "is mostly
commissions. I have a little pile of my
own in readiness to go down, and unless
something extraordinary happens I will
speculate on Corbett."
The sentiment among the members of
the "finest" seems to be for Fi:zsinimons.
Several years ago, when FitzMmmons met
Dempsey, the "cops' ' went down the line
heavily on ; : Jack, ; and %. dropped quite a
sum. They think that they will recover
most of their losses in the coming light
by picking the elongated boxer to win. >
. -Shrewd sports still assorts that \ the bet
ting will b* even money by to-morrow
night,- and claim - that Fitzsimmons' sup
porters will do a wise thing to snap at all
the wagers in sight at prevailing odds.
As a rule the Corbott people are atill will
ins to offer 10 to 8. and in some cases com
promise at 10 to 1%.
Jem Mace notified Barney Aaron that
he would back Corbett to the extent of
$500. Mace, who knew Fitzsimmons
netore became to America, says Fitzsim
mons, while being a great fighter, is not
up to Corbett in point of cleverness, and,
like Al Smith, he thinks Jim will win
handily.
Jimmy Hayes, who has been offering
even money right along, took a few small
waeers on Corbett yesterday at 10 to 9.
Referee Frank Abrahams said yesterday
that ho had received another commission
of $3000 to back Fitzsimmons from a few
Wail-street friends. He will tase Bto 10
if he cannot do better.
"Jack" Smith, Dave Sullivan's man
ager, on Saturday night made a wager of
$200 to $350 on Fitzsimmons with a Boston
friend. It is said that Mike Katzemtein
of the Palace Hotel, San Francisco, who is
in this city, has backed Fitzsimmons for
over $2000 "at 7 to 5, despite the conflict
ing tips he has received from bis friends
at Carson.
Joe Harris, another enthusiastic Fits
simmons man, invested $200 yesterday at
10 to 8.
Major MeLaughlin received another dis
patch from Mose Gunst, the San Francisco
spore Tho latter states that money is
be m Â£ placed in four numbers on Jim, and
he cannot see how Jim can lose.

PROFESSOR BAIRD
BACK IN FRESNO
His Hem --Coming Recalls
a Scandal of Nine
Years Ago.
j,
By Wooing the Wife of Another
Man He Wrecked Twd
Households.
Married the Woman Afterward, and
Both Became Traveling
Evangelis's.
FRESNO, Cal., March 14.â Professor E.
A. Baird is in Fresno once more after an
absence of nearly nine years in the East.
His wife, he says, is acting as oreanist at a
revival meeting in Visalia, and will join
him as soon as she finishes her engage
ment.
Professor and Mrs. Baird, who was then
Mn. J. G. Tnttle, were the principals of a
very salacious scandal immediately before
they left Fresno nine years ago. Both
were married and had families residing in
the colonies. Both were music teachers,
and their intimacy first began while giv
ing concerts together in different towns
of the valley. They also gave entertain
ments at neighboring places in this
county, and according to the story brought
out during the divorce proceedings of Mr.
and Mrs. J. G. Tuttle, it was on the even
ing rides to and from these points that
the entente cordiale between the two
music teachers was established.
Mr. Tuttle remained home and looked
after his farm and did not accompany Ins
wile on these occasions. Mrs. Baird
stayed at home, not suspecting her faith
less husband. The resalt was chat the
Tuttle family was broken up and man
and wife were separated. Mr. Tuttlo
made scandalous charges against his wile
and Professor Baird, and she replied with
grave accusations regarding his doings in
the East before they came to California.
Alter the divorce was procured, Mrs.
Tuttle assumed her maiden name of Juliet
McCleland and left Fresno. Shortly after
that Professor Baird aIBO departed, and
later it was learned that they and joined
each other in Oregon, where they contin
ued giving concerts.
After the processor's unceremonious de
parture Mrs. Baird instituted proceedings
fo? divorce, and it was granted. Then
Professor Baird and Mrs. Tuttle. or Miss
McCleland, were married. They went
East, and it is reooi ted that they toured
tae country, Jie as an evangelist, and she
as a vocalist. They spent a number of
years in Michigan, where Professor Baird
went into business, but he was not very
successful. They ihen came West again.
Mr. Tuttle died in this city a few years
ago. Harry Tuttle, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Tuttle, is now said to be winning fame in
New York as a cornet-player, in fac; he
is classed among the best in the country.

FIVE SUPREME
COURT RULINGS
Decisions Handed Down in
Southern California
Actions.
Ventura and Ojai Valley Rail
way Loses Through an
Appeal.
St. Joseph's Hospital in San Diego
to Retain Property Bequeathed
by J M. Little.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 14.âSev
eral decisions were received here yester
day from the Supreme Court deciding
appeals from the Superior Courts of
Southern California. In the case of Mar
garet J. Barry, administratrix of the
estate of J. M. .Little, appellant, against
St. Joseph's Hospital and Sanitarium of
the Sisters of Mercy et al., the judgment
of the lower court was affirmed. The suit
was instituted in San Diego to set aside
deeds to three pueblo lots in that city
which Little during his lifetime had exe
cuted in favor of the hospital. The Su
preme Court holds that the transaction
was a proper one and the consideration
sufficient.
The court reversed the judgment of the
lower court and grunted a new trial in the
case brought by the Santa Monica Lum
ber Company against J. H. flege, ap
pellant, and Dr. William Nanmann, de
fendant. Tnis suit was brought to fore
close a lien on Santa Monica pr perty for
material. The Superior Court decided
that Naumann was liable and that a lien
against the property would be valid if
properly executed.
In the case of R. fl. Shoemaker Jr.
against David D. Acker the Supreme
Court affirmed the decision of Superior
Judge Waldo M. York here, before whom
the case was tried. The action was a dam
age suit for $35,000 for breach of a written
contract, and the appeal was taken from
the verdict of the jury allowing the de
fendant $2000.
The judgment of the lower court in the
suit brought by the Ventura and Ojai Val
ley Railway Company against F. Hartman
was reversed, and the Supreme Court di
rected the Superior Judge of Ventura
County to sustain the demurrer to tne
complaint. Tne suit was brought to re
cover certain assessments on the capital
stock of the company which had been
subscribed by Hartman. The judgment
of the lower court was for the company,
and the Supreme Court reversed this de
cision on the ground that the company
had no right to levy an assessment, be
cause one-fourth of its capital stock had
not been actually subscribed.
The Supreme Court reversed the judg
ment of the lower court in the foreclosure
suit brought by the California Savings
Bank of San Diego against W. Parrish
et al., and ordered the Superior Court to
nsustain the demurrer to the cross-cor-

Work on the >ptc Line to Commence

LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 14.â
Randsburg is to hare its first railroad
soon. Work will be begun on a line be
tween Kramer, on the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad, and Randsburg inside of a week
and will be hurried to completion. The
route is along one natural grade for the
whole distance, except where it crosses the
divide east of Ransburg, where, it is un
derstood, the heaviest grade will be en
countered. This will not exceed ninety
feet to the mile, and only for a mile or
two at that. The advent of a railroad will
doubtless be a great benefit to the camp
and will induce many to come who are
now kept away by the long stage ride from
either railroad.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
FROM DIVERS
PULPITS
Rev. W. A. Gardner, pastor of the West
Side Christian Church, preached last even
ing to a crowded church on the Fitzsim
mons and Corbett contest. He said:
On the first day of January, 1897, there
was not a place in the United States where
it was lawful for men for a prize or wager
deliberately to meet and pound each other
until one or both were dead or "finished."
On the 29th day of February the law
makers of Nevada said: "Our forty
four sister States are mistaken in
making it a crime for men to fight for a
wager." They therefore enacted a law
which, according to Judge Bonnitield,
Chief Justice of the Bupreme Court of
Nevada, "legalizes the taking of human
life for a reward or wager." The two
BISHOP GEORGE W. CLINTON.
excuses offered by the Legislators of Ne
vada for thus legalizing crime are: "It
will bring money into the State," and "It
will advertise the State." Each of these
statements is true.
Possibly there may be $50,000 left in the
State by those who visit the first prize
fight brought there by their new law; but
Nevada will find it very dearly earned
money. The people who go there will
leave something besides money behind
them. The gathering together in their
capital city of the class of persons who
always swarm around a prize-fight and
the act of their Legislature and Governor
making legal a brutal fight will stain the
morals and blight the character of the
youth of that State, the effect of which
cannot be removed by $50,000,000 of gold.
Truly the State ha* been advertised by
the making of the law and by the light it
has invited.
San Francisco, and especially one of its
churches, was advertised by the murder
of two innocent girls. Thousands flocked
to the church. It was tilled with people
from basement to belfry, but did you
ever hear of any desirable citizens who
wanted to move to this City or become
members of that unfortunate church be
cause of the advertisement by the "crime
of the century"? Such is the advertise*
ment our unfortunate sister State is re
ceiving by the "prize-fight of the cen
tury."
One of the patriotic legislators who con
stituted themselves a committee of invi
tation to bring the Corbett and Fitzsim
mons fight to their State has become seri
ously offended by the insinuations of peo
ple in other States concerning the morals
of Nevada, and he affirms that there is no
State in the Union where life and property
are safer; where women and children re
ceive as great protection and where the
poor are better cared for.
That may have been true in February,
1897, but it will be a long time after tne
17*h day of March, 1897, before, if ever, it
will be again true.
Since the 30th day of last January, when
Governor Sadler signed the law permitting
prize-fighting and Dan Stuart decided that
Nevada should be the battle-ground be
tween Corbett and Fitz-immoiis, the daily
papers of this and other cities have made
occasional (?) references to the event. On
the 4th of this month Mr. McKinley was
inaugurated as President of the United
States, but that event is of such small im
portance with the people of this coast
that the aaily papers give from ten to
fifteen times as much space to the Jatter
event. One paper gives five cuts of the
new President and seventy-five cuts of
Corbett and Fitzeiuimons within the
month.
The people have such a hungering after
this sort of news that their paid agents,
the newspaper reporters and artists are
watching every movement of these men.
They are caught by the kodak when
being welcomed to the State by Governor
Sadler, at the postoffice receiving mail,
sprinting through snow or mud, and in
almost, every attitude the wideawake
newspaper man chances to see them.
The high contracting parties are paid to
tell each day how they have slept, what
they have dreamed, what they ate, eta,
what they are thinking about or any other
matters of importance of which they may
choose to speak.
You will observe that I say the above is
the people's estimate of these events.
Some may inquire why I charge the people
with what the daily papers do. The
Prophet Hosea 2700 years ago said, "Like
people like priest," and bo it is to-day,
"Like people like t'aily papers." That is,
the daily paper is what the people de
mand. Ido not say that this is right, but
I am simply stating a fact.
Whenever the Christian people of this
coast demand it there will be a daily
paper published that will be as careful to
cut out the sensational accounts of prize
fights, horse-mces, lottery-drawings, sui
cides, divorce ecandalÃ, etc., as the pres
ent papers are to secure them. lam hop
ing, praying and working that we may
have such a paper, and to educate the
people up to the necessity for it I deliver
this and similar addresses. Until we have
a better daily paper I shall continue to
patronize those we have and thank them
for the courtesies they show to religious
teachers by weekly publication of their
pulpit utterances and the general religious
newÃ they furnish us.
The fact that such a battle can be fought
on American soil at the close of the nine
teenth century ana be lauded and patron
ized as it has been and will be is a sad
commentary upon the degraded state of
the morals of this Christian land.
" Pugilistic and
Football Insanity."
Dr. HemphiU's topic last evening was
"Athletic Contests i-n General and One
Contest in Particular." His text was 1
C irin thian s, ix :24-27. He said :
These mataphors are borrowed from the
athletic contests of the Greeks who bulked
big in the eye of the world then, and who,
because of their present plucky attitude
a ainst the great powers of Europe, bulk
big in the eye of the world now. That
these athletic contests were attended with
manifest evils, like some of the athletic
contests of our own day, is more than
likely. Paul did not condemn them in
general; nor do we. Love of play is na-
tnral, but if to you all the world is a huge
football iield and all the men and women
in it are merely players, then your love of
play is a malign passion which you cher
ish at the peril of your own undoing.
President Jordan has much to say about
religious insanity, but not a word about
football insanity, which would be a far
more timely topic. The feverish, all
absorbing excitement, which, during the
football season, paralyzes the higher
activities of our young men is fast making
a once innocent amusement an evil that
will have to be shunned like opium
smoking or whisky-dnnKinjr. Amusement
has its place. Keep it in its place. Keep
it your servant and it will bless you. Let
it become master and it will curse you. It
is like a medicine. Tasen in right quan
tity, it is a healthful tonic. Too much of
it is a deadly poison.
Returning to .Paul, he did condemn
some contests in particular. To the
Christians at Corinth, he writes:
"Whether, therefore, ye eat or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the dory of
God." And to the Christians at Colosse
in tbe same strain, he writes: "Whatso
ever ye do in word or in deed, do all in
the name of the Lord Jesus." Badger
baiting, bear fights, bull fights, cock fights,
dog fights, man fights â can you witness
these things to the glory of God and in tbe
flame of the Lord Jesus? If you can, you
must either have a very queer conscience
or a very queer Lord Jesus.
Amusements of all sorts may be put
into three categories : First, those which
are forever right, and in these all Chris
tians of every name can engage without
harm and it may be with profit; second,
those wbich are forever wrong, and in
these no Christian can engage without
harm and loss; and third, those which
are debatable, and when you have a doubt
about anything don't d*o it. "He tnat
doubteth is damned if he doubts." It
may be right for some one else, but wrong
for you because you have a doubt about it.
In which category shall we place prize
fighting? I shall neither insult your inÂ»
telligence nor your piety by discussing
the question before you. It is not in de
batable territory at all. There is not a
man whose opinion on moral questions is
worth a bean who does not condemn
pugilism as utterly brutal, degrading, dis
gusting, diabolical; the most diabolical
of all diabolical sports upon which all the
diabolical passions of human nature feed
and grow fat. "The manly art," they call
it. No, it Is the brute's art, the art of
self-defense. It is the devil's own.
Here is Paul's infallible test for the
coming prize-right: Get down on your
knees when none but God is near and
pray this prayer if you can: "Oh, God, I
am going to see tbe prize-fight in Nevada
next Wednesday for thy glory and in the
name ol the Lord Jesus." Would you,
would I, would any man dare to insult
God by offering such a hypocritical prayer
as that? I wonder how many praying
men will go to see the disgusting exhibi
tion next Wednesdayâ two brutes, yea,
worse than brutes, doing their best, or
their worst, to kill one another.
Poor little Nevada! The only Btate in
the American Union that is willing to be
infamous. Poor poverty-stricken Ne
vada, its products for the most part al
kali, sagebrush and jackass rabbits 1 Poor,
purchasable Nevada â carried in the veÃt
pockets of the highest bidders! Poor, de
cadent Nevada ! What a pity it was ever
admitted to Statehood. And what a pity
tnat the Statehood cannot be taken away
from it because it consents to this infamy.
Poor, disappointed Nevada â the emblem
on its seal of State the riaing bud 1 Blot it
oat and pat in instead the brawny fists
and the ugly faces of the prize-fighting
idols of the hour. And the disgusting
exhibition is to take place on St. Patrick's
day! Well, the Emerald Isle supplies a
large porportion of the world's profee
sional sluggers, and the sons of the Emer
ala Isle chose the day of all the year they
love the best.
His Life Work
Among Drunkards.
6. H. Hadley, superintendent of the
Jerry McAuley Mission of Water street,
New YorK City, spoke in the Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
Mr. Bad ley, who has himself known
what it was to be down, labors exclu
sively among the lower classes of the
metropolis. He entertained and in
structed the audience with an account
of the methods and results of his mission
work among the drunkards of New York.
"You know as well as I do," he said,
"that in every city there is a great army
of drunkards. I have traveled with them
for years. I know their needs and I know
their temptations. Unfortunately they
are just as far out of the pale of the
church as though they were Hottentots,
but they do come to the mission. It is
true they are sometimes badly damaged
when we get them, but they make grand
Christians when they are saved."
Mr. Hadley spoke of the unemployed in
this City and he said he was going down
to see them because he knew that kind of
people. He said tne strong must help tne
weak and at his mission in New York he
had never refused any one anything he
asked for. He "declared the Lord never
sent more work to then than they could
do.
Sin Has the Power
of Self-Perpetuation.
Dr. Case spoke from Galatians vi-7:
"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
also reap." On the subject "Consequen
ces," hb said: "As we sow so shall we
reap. This it a great and universal law.
Deeds are seeds. So with good deeds as
weft as evil. God's harvest is just as sure
as the devil's. God's seed shall come to
God's harvest. Sin Las the awful power
of self- perpetuation. A stub of a cigar
thrown into the dry grass starts a fire that
sweeps down forests and towns with irra
sistiuie mastery. To break one of the
least of God's laws is to open a channel
for destructive energy to work havoc. The
excesses of youth are drafts upon age that
must be met. Character is consolidated
habit. Evil done is not evil done with.
Coleridge says: 'Evil habit first tries,
then drags, then drives.' We naturally
dislike restraints; we hate law. We don't
like the commandments. We are apt to
think we have outgrown them. Many
want no God ; hope there is none.
But now would they feel on a train go
ing at SO miles an hour and no engineer or
fireman on the engine? Or to be at sea in
a storm without compass or pilot? A
universe without a God â too dreadful to
think about. Every commandment is an
illumination and a defense. The fast
young man shuts his eyes to the light and
his ears to the note of warning. He is
going fast from God ; where will he pull
up? Going fast from holiness and purity.
Fast life is artificial life. It is a flash of
pleasure and an eternity of disappoint
ment. Fast life means wrecked health,
horrors of remorse, black despair. Men
are lost not for doing wrong, but for be
ing wrong. A crazy man buckled a
lightning rod to his back to ward off
lightning. Do not make religion a light
ning rod or a fire escape, but let it be
your life.
The Feast of St. Joseph
and Its Lessons.
At St. Mary's Catholic Church last
night the rector, Rev. Henry H. Wyman,
preached a sermon on the feast of St.
Joseph and the lessons to be drawn there
from.
He described tbe saint as one of the
highest types of sanctity. He told the
story of the immaculate conception and
of Joseph's faith in bia spouse and his
trust in God.
"Prayers addressed to this saint," said
the preacher, "will give as the strength to
bear the trials of this life. He is the
patron oi the spiritual life. He may be
called the master of the spiritual life, be
cause his was tbe singular privilege to die
in the presence of our Divine Lord and
the Blessed Virgin. St. Joseph has, there
fore, been cho=en as the patron of a happy
death."
He exhorted his hearers to make the
life of St. Joseph an ideal, assuring them
that in poverty and sickness it is always
capable of affording consolation and ex
ample.
Bishop Clinton
at Zion Church.
Bishop George W. Clinton of St. Louis
preached yesterday at the First African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on
"Higher and Spiritual Evolution," taking
his text from Psalms, lxvii:l3: "Though ye
have lain among the pota, ye snail be as
the wings of a dove covered with silver,
and her feathers with yellow gold." He
said:
"The text before us describes a very sad
and pitiable condition of a great people.
But while a part of the text describes such
a debased condition it also sets forth the
possibility of the attainment of a condition
as bigh above that, and one which stands
in as great contrast to that low condition
as does man in his civilized state stand
above the species of animal claimed by
some to be his ancestor.
"This text refers to the despicable con
dition of Israel in Egypt when subjected
to the cruel treatment and debasing in
fluences of that godless people and
idolatrous nation. Truly Israel's condi
tion is most fittingly described by the
clause, 'I am among the pots.'
"What was Israel's condition then has
been the condition of other nations, races
and individuals time and again in this
world. Such is the condition of nations,
races ana individuals now in many
places."
The Triumph of
Life in Death.
Rev. M. P. Boy n ton of the Baptist
Church preached yesterday morning on
'â¢Life and Death," from the text John xii,
24-25: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, ex
cept a grain of wheat fall into the ground
and die, it sbideth by itself alone; but if it
die it beareth much fruit." He said:
i'lnlip brought the Greeks to Christ
who had said "We would see Jesus" and
the Lord uttered these wonderful words
that proclaim a life in death and a gain in
loss. A right understanding of this text
means a right conception of life. Christ
would free us from the narrow cell of self
consciousness. Jesus' idea of life means
other lives springing up, and that life that
refuses to increase soon finds its lot to be
oblivion. Life in Christ means a giving
up of self. The Cuban patriot who was
shot in the early dawn will rise again in
those who take his place in the great
struggle for liberty and instead of the one
there will be the score.
Anything that frets us from self is a
blessing. Why the gilded hall, tue flash
ing lights, the melody of music, the thrill
of the drama? Why the running from
house to house, from Slate to State, from
land to land? It is man's mad effort to
escape from himself. Christ offers this
escape in himself. He who is free from
himself in Christ will understand death
and read his life-experiences as an open
book. Such an one will not be contented
with his childhood, but will long for the
years of maturity and manhood. The
mo9t wonderful story in the world is your
own life. Taere axe no darker plots in
fiction than those laid by the enemy of
your soul. No hero in song can compare
with the heroic that may be developed n
your own heart, if you will but die in
Christ. Placing onr nauds in Christ a, we
delve into the profan-iry of the t !Â»ought
until we possess the jewelâ ife in death.
All foes are then -defeated, all darkness is
light, all life delizht, and wÂ« eâ¢.alm, O
death, where is thy sting?" All death is
life, all life is God.
Rev. R. C. Foute
at Grace Church.
Rev. E. C. Foute, preaching at Grace
Episcopal Church last night, took his
text from St. Matthew 8:22; "But Jesus
said unto him follow me, and let-the
dead bury their dead."
These seemingly harsh words, the
speaker said, applied rather to the spirit
ually dead thai, the physically dead.
Christ was urging mankind to abandon
evil and follow him. In order to do this
men must rise above the selfish level of
worldliness and live n spiritual life, lhe
spiritually dead in Christ's day were the
Sadducees and Pharisees, who cared
neither for God nor man.
Mrs. Hoffman's
Talk on Temperance
Mrs. Clara Hoffman, National treasurer
of the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, delivered an address at the Cali
fornia M. E. Church last evening, upon
the purposes and achievements of the or
ganization which she represents.
Mrs. Hoffman detailed a number of cir
cumstances wtiich she considered indica
tive of the progress which temperance
ideas had made. The influence of Mrs.
Frances Cleveland, she said, had been
potently exerted in this direction in the
National Capitol during the last four
years, and as an instance she related that
ex-Secretary Carlisle, himself a rather
heavy drinker, recently gave an elaborate
banquet, at which no liquors were served.
The progress of temperance sentiments
in the religious and industrial as well as
the social life of the country was dwelt
upon at length.
Mrs. Hoffman also made a spirited at
tack upon the tobacco habit, which, she
said, bad become the object of agitation
by the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union all over the United States.
Mention was made of the good work
which the union had done in securing
laws for the instruction in the public
schools upon the evil effects of alcoholic
drinks and also the passage of laws in
many States for the protection of minor
girls.
In her closing remarks Mrs. Hoffman
called upon her hearers to be examples to
the young and show by their whole lives
that they were uncompromisingly op
posed to the liquor and tobacco habits.
Dr. E R. Dille on
Unitarianism.
The Rer. E. R. Dille of the Central
Methodist Church discoursed on Unita
rianiim last night. A few of his remarks
were as follows:
"In preaching on TJnitarianism I do so
in no controversial spirit. Many Uni
tarians are my personal friends. With
Unitarians I have no controversy and no
qnarrel. I am ready to admit that as a
denomination they -have done something
for religious thought and religious liberty,
and rendered Christianity a service by
emphasizing and elevating the conception
of Christ's manhood.
"But while I concede to the Unitarians
the possession of much truth, and give
them credit for their influence upon the
literature, culture aud philanthropy of
our time, their denial of the deity of. the
Lord Jesus Christ takes them, as a de
nomination, outside the Christian pale,
and robs their system of moral and apir-
Itual power."
The speaker then proceeded to an af
firmative argument for the deity of
Christ, based on the Scripture, his perfec
tion as a teacher, bis resurrection and his
influence on the world.
THE YOUNG PATRIOTS.
Adding to the Membership Roll of the
â¢ Valentine Holt Society.
The monthly meeting of the Valentine
Holt Society, Children of the American
Revolution, was held last Saturday in the
residence of Mrs. C. W. Moores, 1712 Web
ster street, when Miss Edna Datton,
daughter of Samuel Button and descend
ant of John Libbey and John de Mier,
revolutionary soldiers in the New Hamp
shire and New York lines of the Conti
nental army, was elected to membership.
Miss Harriette Wing Moulton read a
very carefully prepared paper on, "What
Connection Had Thomas Jefferson With
the Repeal of the Primogeniture Act?"
The subject of the lesson for the after
noon was, "John Adams." The work of
the society for the past year has been the
study of the lives of the Presidents of the
United States, and the willingness of the
young patriots to continue in this line is
shown by the remarkable excellence of
the papers presented.
The president of the society, Mrs. A. S.
Hubbard, gave vii interesting account of
the National convention of the Children
of the American Revolution held in the
city of Washington on Washington's
birtnday and it created much enthusiasm
among the members.
At the close of the business meeting
there was presented a charming literary
programme arranged by tho committee

SPIRITUALISM DEFINED.
Elder 15. 'X. An dross Speaks on the Sec
ond (omiiig of Christ.
Elder E. E. Andross of the Seventh-day
Adventist Church spoke last evening at
the hall, 1049 Market street, on the subject
of spiritualism. He said:
"This delusive work of Satan in these
times is plainly foretold in the New Testa
ment. Many Scriptures show that in the
last days, or just before the second com
ing of Christ, there is to come a time of
especial peril and numerous deceptions in
spiritual anl religious matters.
"A spiritualist is one who believes that
departed spirits communicate directly
with men through the agency of mediums
and by various signsâ one who holds in
tercourse with departed spirits.
"We believe that spiritualism is the
working of Satan with all power and
signs and lying wonders to deceive. We
are told that evil angels, tra^formed as
ministers of righteousness, are to deceive,
if possible, the very elect. The spirit
speaketh expressly that in the latter
times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits and doc
trines of devils. We have not the time to
describe the various modes of operation
adopted in the manifestations of the phe
nomena of spiritualism. The crowning
work of its deception is the so-called ma
terialization of spirits.
"That individual who does not believe
that there is a power in spiritualism is ,
certainly deceived, and is where he may
be led into its delusions. The doctrines of J
spiritualism are honeycombing our*^
churches to-day."

NATIONAL GUARD
Talk About the Election of
the Colonel of the
Third.
Officers From Whom No Expla- j
nation Was Deemed
N cessary.
Long Daley-d Decision; â The 0 d j
Springfie'd R fl s to B2 R^p a: d
by Some of Later Date.
There was considerable talk in the
Rational Guard ranks hist week about the
turning down of Lieutenant-Colonel
Duboce for promotion for the position of
colonel of the First Infantry Regiment,
Second Brigade.
Twenty-four hours before the election it
was ascertained that there were more than
â¢ nough among tne forty officers entitled
to vote to secure the lieutenant-colonel
the position he would have been pleased
to fill, but which he did not electioneer
for, he having lonp ago declared that if he
were the choice of his brother officers for
the colonelcy of the regiment he would
1 feel proud of the honor and would do all
in his power to bring the regiment up to j
a standard of efficiency of which every
man in the regiment might justly feel
proud.
Thar* were a number of the officers who
called on him and tendered their sup
port, and there was no pledge, only their
honor. But when the eve before election
came some one started the rumor that if
it appeared on the first ballot that the
lieutenant-colonel did not secure the po
sition 2, combination had been made by
wnich Major Charles L. Tilden was to
have it.
This rumor reached the ears of the ma
jor, who on the night of election, before
placing the lieutenant-colonel in nomina
tion, declared that he was not a candidate
for the position of colonel and never had
been after the announcement of Coionel
llacdona:d's resignation had been made
known. Not only did be not have any
thoughts in that direction, but 011 several
occasions he had been approached and
toid persons who spoke to him of the va
cancy that he was not a candidate.
In spite of this assurance there were
some of the officers who thought they still
saw the combination, and they voted
against the lieutenant-colonel with the
result that James F. Smith was elected.
The new colonel of the First is a good
â oidier, a very diplomatic man, and one
who, it is believed, will work hard to ad
fvance the interest of the regiment, but
there are some of the officers who since
the election have come to the conclusion,
in view of possibilities, that it might have
been better had they voted as they origin
ally intended to. Three of these ca.ied
upon the lieutenant-colonel last week and
said they desired to offer explanations.
â¢'Did you call on me and offer to rote for
me?' asked the lieutenant-colonel. "Yes,"
was the simultaneous reply of the three.
"Did you vote for me?" "Xo," said one
of the three, who acted as spokesman for
all, "that is what we have come to ex
plain." "Then," said the lieutenant
colonel, waving his hand in the direction
of the door, "there is no explanation," and
with that the trio retired.
The new colonel will probably assume
command within the next ten days, and
the probabilities are that at that time, or
shortly thereafter, t.crfi will be several
surprises in the First which wi'.l cause
several individuals to exclaim "Where
are we at?" What these surprises are is
kÂ«Dt a secret, but there are those who,
when asked what they are, do as Cissy
Fitzgerald doesâ wink â that and nothing
more.
A long time ago a man named Douglass
was brought before a court of inquiry in
regard to the management of certain
matters connected with the naval bat
talion, and the court, consisting of Major
Tilden, Captain D. A. Smith and Lieu
tenant (junior grade) Underbill, presented
their report last October, and since tnat
time, so it is stated at division nead
quarters, the case has rested in the hands
of Judge- Advocate James F. Smith.
Ajiottier case is the investigation of
Troop A. cavalry, and what Captain Jenks
bad to do with its finances. In that case
a conclusion was reached some time Ago,
but no action, that is final action, has been 1
taken. There are some members of the
cuard who are curious to know the result
of these investigations.
Another mater is occupying the at
tention of the guardsmen, and that is why
no order has yet come from the office of
the adjutant-general at Sacramento in re
gard to target practice. More than two
months and a half have slipped by and
no State Bhoot has been ordered, and now
that the new shooting regulations are to
go into effect in June next the officers and
men are at a loss to know what is going to
be done. Possibly after the adjournment
of the .Legislature in a few days the Sacra
mento office will give some attention to
this matter.
The guard will at last cast aside the old
Springfield rifles of the issue of 1873 and
receive from the United States Govern-]
merit the modern Springfield that were
called in to make way for the Krag-
Jorgensens, with which the regulars are
now armed. The Government will issue
rifles within 10 per cent of the total equip
ment of the guard in this State.
The bill relating to retiraruootn. pub
lished in lafct Monday's issue of The
Call, has become a law, having been
signed by the Governor.
The Naval Battalion.
The Naval Battalion was drilled on the
Bpreckels wharf last Tuesday and the
men exhibited great proficiency in the
movements. Of late they have taken an
unusual interest in the tactics and every
man seems to be striving to outdo the
other in his endeavor :o thoroughly mas
ter all the evolutions.
The battalion will have another drill on
the same wharf to-morrow night, and
these will be kept tin weekly so that when
the men once have learned all that (here
is to be learned they will be kept in prac
tice. _________
A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION
That Is What the Inspector-Gen
eral Has Gained of the
Presidio Post.
The Soldiers Are Tninking of the Great
Military Tournament That Will
B; H; d in April.
Everything in regular army circles on
this coast is quiet at this tim 2. The only
matter of unusual interest is the inspec
tion at the several posts by Inspector*
General Burton. His inspection will not
be limited to the men at the posts, bat it
will be extended to the buildings and
everything connected with each. While
he has not expressed any opinion in re
gard to what he has already seen there is
reason to believe that he has Deen favor
ably impressed.
A "hold-up" at 9:30 p. m. in a locality by
no means uninhabited, does not take place
every day in the week even in San Fran
cisco. C. F. A. Postel, a prosperous grocer
and wine merchant, whose store is situaied
on the corner of Fillmore and Uni^n
streets, was the victim of such an unrer
taking.on Friday night last, and is $Jo
poorer in consequence.
Mr. Postel was behind the counter on
Saturday evening, when two men bU'l
-denly entered the store. They both car
ried ominous-looking six-shooters and
were effectually disguised by handker
chiefs, wuich covered the lower part of
their faces.
Postel received a summary order to
throw up his hands. He did not comply
at first, thinking that the whole affair was
merely a practical joke, and began to laugh
heartily. His assailants did not recipro
cate this amenity, but curtly repeated
their request for bim to throw up his
hands. "This is no joke," said the spokes
man gruffly. tl \Ve mean business."
Tnen, while one of them made Postel
retreat into the bar behind the store, the
other grabbed a bag in which all ioose
change is kept beneath the counter, *nd
both men hastened away with their ill
eot'.en booty, amounting to about $35 in
silver.
Meanwhile Postel and his wife had
reached the sidewalk by the back way and
had given the alarm. A crowd soon col
lected 011 side the store, to whom Postel
told his story. Several paÂ«sers-by stated
that they had a moment before seen two
men running across a vacant lot on the
same side of Union street as Postel's store,
ana another man, wuo arrived later, said
he had met the same parties on Filbert
street, apparently out of breath and ex
cited. Sergeant Harper and Officer Con
ley took Postal's statement, but no clew
to ttie identity of the culprits could be dis
covered.
Speaking of the affair yesterday Mr.
Postel said that tne robbers were evidently
familiar with his habits, inasmuch as in
stÂ» ad of trying to break open the till they
immediately laid hands upon the bag of
change beneath the counter. Both men
were something like 5 feet 8 inches in
height, slimly built and of light com
plexion, from what little could be seen of
their faces.
At the time the robbery was committed
thtj two officers who patrol this beat were
at Harbor View and Hyde street respec
tively, a fact with which the culprits were
evidently familiar. Mr. Postei now con
tends that the district requires better
police protection and there are many who
will sympathize with his point of view.
Two car lines pass Mr. Postel's store,
the one on Fillmore and the other on
Union street, and there are always people
in the neighborhood. But the very un
expectedness of a barefaced hold-up of
this description was a factor contributing
to trie success of the perpetrators.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
A. J. VANDEUSEN.
A member of the Winona Rifle Club of Minnesota. On February 21 he made a score
of 500 points in 100 shots on the new Columbia target, or a hve-inch average.
This is one of the best 200-yard offhand scores ever made, all of the 100 shots
being within the 12-inch black.
A, H. PAPE BREAKS
A RIFLE RECORD
Three Shots in a Two-Inch
Circle on the Long
Range.
Several San Jose and Stockton
Marksmen Guests at
Shell Mound
The Germaaia Club Fum shin; Many
Pub ie Shootin? Attractions
This Y.'ar.
There were lots of rifle, pistol and mus
ket shooting at the Shell Mound rifle
range yesterday. During most of the day
tbe light was pood and the wind fair.
Later the light played odd pranks on the
targets and the wind died out, leaving the
smoke heavy on the range. For all that
many good scores were made.
Tbe regular monthly medal shoot and
contests for special prizes of the Columbia
i Pistol and Rifle Club drew together a
large attendance. Three visitors spent
the day with the members of the club.
Two are members of the Schuetzen Rifle
Club of San Jose â Dr. F. H. Bangs and
Dr. A. M. Barker. The former was the
winner of the silver service presented by
C. M. Shortridge when that club opened
its new range last year. Dr. Barker is
also a medal- winner. The gentlemen
were provided with their rifles and took a
| lively part in the re-entry contests. The
third visitor wai Mr. Philip-on of the
Stockton Rifle Clud, recently organized.
That club has a membership of thirty
riflemen. It is preparing to construct a \
200-yard range near Stockton, on which
some rood results are expected before
long. The Columbia's guests were much
interested in the results obtained by the
new nitro rifle powder experiments, both
pure and for priming. It is not unlikely
that the San Jose and Stockton Clubs will
adopt the new Columbia target, which re
ceived such a flattering vote in the recent
! contest for a standard target lor the
United States.
A. H. Pape broke the three-shot rifle
record yesterday in the Bushnell medal
match. He made 1, 1, 4â6, in three con
secutive shot--. This means thut two bul
lets strucK the inch center and the third
was only two inches from tbe center, or
an average of three shots in a two-inch
circle offhand, 200 yards. In this match
Pape yesterday lowered his record by six
points, his best thirty-shot scores averag
ing ninety points on three-inch bullseye
hits.
Several other fine scores were also made.
Charlie Daiss in the ten-shot fifty-yard
diamond pistol record made 33 points, the
best score made this year, and only beaten
lasc year by A. B. Dorrell's score of 30.
Ed Hovey ran up a score of 48, Creed moor
count, in the Glindeinann military mus
ket match. F. E. Mason, first class, made
a record of 46, wnich is shooting in cham
pionship form. The class medal scores

SCORNS SARDOU
AND THE COMBINE
Plucky Fanny Davenport
Will Fight for Her
Rights.
Much to Be Expected From a
Woman Who Can Keep
a Secret.
A Wonderful Nameless New Pay
and an Author Whose Identity
She Conceals.
Fanny Davenport, actress, has earned
the right to the title of "The Fearless."
She has two great rights on hand. With
a true artist's inherent love of justice and
the fairness of things she is prepared to
enter the arena single handed and meet
the two greatest theatrical powers, Sardou, |
the famous French playright, and the
eaually famous and all-grabbing great
American syndicate, with Hayman, Froh
man, X aw & Krlanger and four other
minor powers as the head and front of the
offending.
The two great, fights are not billed for
the same day. Sardou la to get his pun
ishment rirst â be was ti.e first to chal
k-nee â and the famous actress will attend
to tne great theatrical trust.
According to Miss Davenport the French
playwright is an incongruous personality.
In his home he is charming, delightful,
generous and hospitable, but in his bureau
d'affaires he is exacting, discourteous,
unreasonable and grabbing.
"I never spent such charming three days
as those I passed as Sardou's guest, at his
lovely castle at Marly le Roi," said Miss
Davenport. "There is something enchant
ing about bis home. From the moment
that you enter the doorway, bordered on
either side Dy a row of sphinx, you feel
you are in an atmosphere of art. Sardou's
home life is beautiful, surrounded as he
is by everything that tasta can suggest
and wealth purchase. . But in him you
find the artist and the business man
strangely and inexplicably combined.
"Wnen 1 took 'Cleopatra' Jrom him,"
continued the actress, "it was after that
most delightful visit t<> his country borne.
With one band he extended to me the i
manuscript, tied and sealed, and be never
let go untu I placed iv his other hand mv
check for $ 10, 000â -bonus for the play.
Eacli plaie, with its mean little water
color sketches of either scene or costume,
represented a grateful 'thank you' and
$100 note, and suggestions as to 'business'
were forthcoming at the same modest
price. And, withal, I had to bs extremely
careful. There could be no demurs. The.
great playwright's leelings are easily hurt,
and li your notes are not forthcoming
quickiy enough he flies into a passion,
paces t:ie floor, and while tearing his hair
cries: 'You think lam a thief. I would
rob you.' "
And that, it appear?, is exactly what
Sardou is trying to do. When Miss Daven
port secured "Gismonda" there was the
usual bonus and 10 per cent royalties ex
acted. "Ciismonda' 1 was not to be done
in French for two years, after which the
royalties were to drop from 10 to 4 per
cent.
The two years have passed. "Gismonda"
has been produced by Sarah Beruhardt â
to wnom, by the way, Miss Davenport
waived all her American rights â and now
Sardou wants his 10 per cent, like Tenny
son's book, to go on forever.
Through his agent, Miss Marbury, he
has brought suit in New York, but la
Davenport defies him and is ready to bat
tle and prepared to win.
Fighting the great combine will proba
bly be not such an easy walkover. The
syndicate has secured a chain of the lead
ing theaters of the United States. Man
agers have been forced to agree to its
terms. Ti;e syndicate controls the lead
ing companies and most of the stars, and
the management which will not come to
terms with them is going to rind itself
in the embarrassing position of having a
theater with no attractions to book.
When the theatrical trust first became
a power an opposition party of actors was
formed, with Nat Goodwin at their head.
The cÂ« nvivial Goodwin has, however, gone
over to the enem.v's camp, and in the
brave little army of re Deis are only left
Joe Jefferson, Francis Wilson and Miss
Dave.iport.
"1 will never submit to the syndicate,"
explained Miss Davenport. "To fall in
line means for them to book you when
and where they please, for which they are
entitled to 5 per cent of your gross re
ceipts and another 5 per cent for permit- â 
ting you to play in their theaters. Joe
Jefferson is gome to hold aloof, but that
is comparatively easy for he only plays
ten weeks a season. Another who will
not consent to enrich a company of un
scrupulous managers is Francis Wilson.
Wilson is determined not to submit, and
if it must be, next season he'll play one- j
night stands. As lor myself I need not :
worry for another year. I am booked foi
an indefinite run at the Tremom Theater,
Boston, booked before the day of the
combination, and if after that I cannot
get an independent tneater, I'll go to
Australia."
it is easy for Miss Davenport to be in*
dependent. In the first place, she has a
*nug little bank account, and secondly,
she has a wonderful new play. This play
is from the pen of a writer whose name
or sex she will not divulge. The play is as
yet unnamed. "It is a historical melo
drama," says Miss Davenport, 4i and that i
is all lam at liDerty to say. The author, I
who has pledged me to secrecy, is not un
known in the field of literature, but ii new
to the stage. I have received already three
acts. They have passed from me to the
author and back again many times, and
when I say I am now satisfied that means
the play must be a tremendous success."
A woman and an actress who has a
wonderful new play in her possession and
won't say one thing about it is a wonder
ful rarity. She is made of different stuff
from the majority. Let Sardou and the
syndicate beware.
JABBED WITH A KNIFE.
Louis K. Feroni Charged With Assault
With a Deadly Weapon and
Attempted Bobbery.
Louis E. Feroni, 26 years of age, who
gives his occupation as an interpreter, was

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
MONDAY. MARCH 15, 1897
All hail Â».he extra session !
Success to your bill, Mr. Dingley.
Now for the tariff of protection and
prosperity.
There will be no complaints of too much
Congress this time.
The country counts on you, Mr. Reed.
Get in and rush things.
Home labor and not prison labor is
what bnilds up the State.
In its main lines the new tariff will be
the McKinley bill over again, and this
time it will stick.
Slum journalism must eventually go to
the slums altogether. The public liDraries
are repudiating id,
Let us bear in mind that free labor pro
duces as cood articles ss prison labor, no
matter what the Examiner says.
The Cuban war has now entered upon
its third year, and, as Spain has not yet
made a strike, she ought to be counted
out.
The change of administration and the
change of atmosphere together are reviv
ing everything. It is going to be a glori
ous spring.
Eastern people are now singing praises
to spring, taking cough medicine, watch
ing out for early violets and dodging
pneumonia.
Among the presents sent to President
McKinley is a tomahawk. Now let the
Iroquois brave 3 look out. The scalping is
about to begin.
It appears mat Mrs. Bradley-Martin
was at the inaugural ball and enjoyed her
self just as much as if there were only four
hundred present.
The Democratic party is not quite
through with the fat incubus yet Cleve
land is said to be writing a book that will
be as big as Bryan's.
Before long the carnivals will be adding
new touches of brightness to the situation
and then pleasure will fairly bubble over
into frolics everywhere.
If the Senators will only behave them
selves as they promise everything will be
all right, and we will have a new tariff to
celebrate on the glorious Fourth.
The Examiner might at least have ab
stained from slandering the Legislature,
buying prison twine and belittling the
products of home labor during Lent.
Only two men in McKinley's Cabinet
had the benefit of a college education, so
it will be seen there is still room in the
politics of this country for the self-taught
man. â¢
It is fortunate that at this juncture we
have in the Presidency a man who knows
how to make friends. Cleveland could
not manage the Senate, but McKin
ley can.
Slandering public men is about as cheap
as any other form of fane news, and de
cadent journals when they see they are
losing too much money often take to it for
economy.
With the beginning of the extra session
of Congress the people of California should
hold an extra session of thought on the
importance of harmony and co-operation
in the upbuilding of the State.
The universal denunciation of vicious
journalism is one of the best signs of an
improved tone of public opinion. Before
long crime-loving papers will have no sup
port except among crime-loving people.
The opportunities to advance the manu
facturing industries of the State will be
better this year than for a long time past
Let us profit by them and buiid up the
homes of the people instead of the prisons
of the State.
With the approach of the rainy season
in Cuba and the beginning of a genuine
American administration in this country,
the outlook for the Cuban patriots is cer
tainly brighter than it has been at any
time sines the war began.
The construction of the Federal build
ing in San Francisco and of the deep har
bor at San Pedro should begin at once.
California counts on her delegation at
Washington to keep at the Government
officials until they get a move on.
There are said to be more unemployed
men in Detroit than ever before in its
history. The potato patch scheme was
such a drawing card that idle people
flocked into the city from every direction,
â nd now there are not enough patches to
go round.
The rapid construction of the Russian
railway across Siberia ought to attract
more attention in California than it does.
The operation of the road will materially
affect our trade with the Orient, and it de
pends upon our energy whether it shall be
to our benefit or our injury.
The civil service rules are good enough,
but many of the men whom Cleveland ap
pointed under them are not good by any
means. To keep the rules right and the
service efficient it will be necessary for
Mr. McKinley to make a number of alter
ations irom the regime of the administra
tion of deficit and disaster.
THE EXTSA SESSION.
The extra session of Congress which
a-s.nibles to-day has every prospect be
fore it cf enacting legislation more impor
tant to the welfare of the country tiian
any which has been enacted since the
close of the war. The committee in
charge of the tariff bill promises to have it
ready as soon as the House is organized,
and a careful study of the members oi
both houses gives promise that the bill
will be adopted without any intense an
tagonism or any attempt at dilatory tac
tic*.
With the passage of the Dingley bill we
shall close the struggles, agitations and
antagonisms of the last twelve years.
Ever since Grover Cleveland came into
office with the avowed intention of de
stroying the protective system the busi
ness of the country has been disturbed,
industry has been rendered uncertain,
enterprises have been made doubtful and
tbe interests of one class of people have
been arrayed against those of another.
Tne defeat of Cleveland in 1888 on a free
trade platform gave the country a tempo
rary respite from these agitations. In
1892, however, they broke out again with
increased vehemence, and despite the /act
that under the McKinley tariff the coun
try attained a degree of prosperity never
known before the incessant clamors of the
free-traders misled the ppople into re
electing Mr. Cleveland in 18!)2.
Since that time the country has had ex
perience with a Cleveland tariff. It has
learned by that experience the folly of
trusting agitators and demagogues. It
now returns to the protectivb system, and
the tariff which will be enacted at the
present session of Congress will be a per
manent part of our industrial system lor
the rest of this generation.
One of the gratifying features of the out
look is the prospect that the new bill will
be passed by what will be virtually the
unanimous consent of all sections of the
Union. Leading men of all parties in
Congress have shown a willingness to per
mit the act to be passed promptly in order
that it may be given a fair trial before the
next election. It is estimated that the
bill will be adopted by the House of Rep
resentatives by about the middle of April
and will reach the Senate in time for that
body to discuss it elaborately and stiil
send it to the President in time for it to
go into force with the beginning of the
new fiscal year, on the Ist of July.
borne congratulation is due to the Dem
ocratic leaders in tne Senate on their wis
dom in advising the members of their
party to make no factious opposition to
the measure. By acting in this conserva
tive way they will go far to redeem their
party from the folly of the last campaign
and win back the confidence which it lost
by the action of the Chicago convention.
The Democrats will lose nothing by the
course which has been outlined for them.
They would lose much, however, if they
persisted in further opposition to protec
tion. The country has now finally passed
judgment on that issue, and any party
which proposes any longer to continue
free-trade agitations to disturb business
might just as well make up its mind to re
tire from politics.
THE FEDERAL BUILDING.
With the opening of the extra session
of Congress to-day renewed efforts should
be made by the California delegation in
Congress to bring about a speedy begin
ning of the work of constructing the Fed
eral building in this City. The agitation
on the subject should not be dropped nor
allowed to nag for a single day. The
work has been already too long post
poned, and the beginning oi a new ad
ministration is the best possible time for
the beginning of a new policy in regard
to the building.
The industrial and commercial bodies
of the City which have co-operated with
The Call in the movement to start the
work dbotild continue that co-operntion
until success is attained. Only by inces
sant vigilance here can we be sure of
activity at Wasbinnton. We must keep
every member of the California delegation
constantly reminded of the importance
of the work to San Francisco, lest in the
confusion and the engagements of the
opening of the new session of Congress
they should be led to overlook the need of
beginning the work at once.
The questions which the people are ask
ing are pertinent They recognize that
the beginning of this work would afford
employment to many persons who are
now without the means of supporting
their families. They are aware that the
money expended for construction would
be put into circulation in the City and
would aid in bringing about the much
needed revival or business. Knowing
these things, they desire to see the work
begun.
What is Senator Perkins doing? Why
are not Congressman Loud and Congress
man Maguire more active in urging the
advancement of the work? Why is not
Senator White showing as much interest
in the welfare of San Francisco as he is in
that of Los Aneeles and San Pedro? vVhy
are not the other members of the Cali
fornia delegation doing something to in
duce the Government officials to rouse
themselves and begin this work at once?
TEADE STEADILY EEVIVING.
Dan's report of the last week's business
shows a steady increase of trade, and the
Review comments on the strange quality
of human nature which keeps up discour
aging talk in spite of the evidence of sta
tistics proving there is pood reason for
buoyant hopes. Hard times have been so
long continued that it seems as if gloom
has become a habit with many people.
That trade is surely though slowly reviv
ing is now a certainty, and it is perhaps a
matter for rejoicing that It is not doing so
any faster, for long experience has proved
that gradual growth is almost invariably
the only way in which permanent pros
perity comes.
It is considered by students of econom
ics that the iron industry is the pulse of
a nation's prosperity. On March 1 the
iron furnaces of this country were pro
ducing 4 per cent more than on February
1. This improvement is much larger
than it sounds, for the same rate would
be 50 per cent in one year. Judging by
the increasing strength of this pulse beat
invalided industry is getting decidedly
convalescent.
The number of failures for the past
week were reduced about one-sixth from
the record of the corresponding week of
last year. This is a wide margin of im
provement and if such a ratio Is kept up
for a few months it will mark all the dis
tance between disaster and prosperity.
The money market is reported to be in the
best of conditions for a healthy expansion
of indnstry and there are no indications
of surplus capital being absorbed by big
speculative enterprises to the deprivation
of more conservative business and the
risk of panic reaction.
Th^ extent to which Western farmers
are finding a foreign market for their corn
is another item of information to Help
brighten the outlcok. The export of the
last two weeks amounted to over 5. 000,000
busbela as compared with 1,500,000 during
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
the same period last year. The alarm
about tbe possibility of an exhaustion of
the wheat supply has passed away and
the export for the past two weeks was
over 2,000,000 bushels.
The signs of the times are that pros
perity is being restored as last as is con
sistent with the laying of a safe founda
tion and careful upbuilding thereon of
something soiid and permanent.
SHAM AND IRRELEVANT.
The Examiner, after several days of elo
quent silence concerning its purchase of
prison-made twine, came nut yesterday in
an editorial wherein it attempted to offer
a sham and irrelevant excuse for the
hypocrisy and iniquity of its relations to
the San Quentin jute mills.
H alleged that "the proprietor of The
Call is a heavy purchaser of sugar- bags
at San Quentin." It obscurely intimated
that "Mr. Spreckels" was the proprietor
of The Call. With equal falsity it in
dulged in the insinuation that the pur
chase of jute baps by the Spreckels susar
interests from San Quentiu was a ques
tionable transaction, for the reason that
in some way it affected the interests of
free labor in California.
There are three answers to the foregoing
triplet of falsehoods, and they are:
Firstâ The proprietor of The Call is
not a purchaser of sugar- bags or anything
else at the Ban Quentin jute mills.
Second â "Mr. Spreckels" is not the pro
prietor of The Call.
Thirdâ The purchase of sugar-bags by
the Spreckels sugar interests is not in any
sense questionable, but, on the other hand,
is in every way a commendable business
transaction, as a reference to the personal
interviews with Mr. Spreckels and with
the representatives of the California free
labor jute mills, which appear else
where in our local columns, will show. The
kind and quality of sugar-bags purchased
at San Quentin are not manufactured in
this country, ana tbe Spreckels sugar in
terests have therefore the alternative of
buying such bags of the State of Califor
nia, and thus assisting to support its
penal institution, or of buying them in
Calcutta. They are bought exclusively
lor use in the Sandwich Islands and for
use in competition with the English
trade. The arrangement for the pur
chase of these goods was made with the
prison authorities with the lr.U concur
rence and approval of tbe California
manufacturers of other lines of jute goods,
from whom the Spreckels interests are
large purchasers of the class of goods
which they produce and are only purchas
ers from Ban Quentin of goods which our
free-labor factories do not and cannot pro
duce in competition with the Calcutta
trade.
The Examiner, on the contrary., buys at
San Quentin a kind and quality of prison
made twine which the free-labor factories
of California do produce and which the
San Quentin mills should not produce.
The Examiner is responsible for this
lapse on the part of the prison authorities
by which they have been misled Into
making jute noods which come directly
into competition with free â labor.
The sham and falsity of its attempted
evasion of responsibility for its purchase
of prison-made twine is too transparent
for furtner discussion, and only intensi
ties the contempt with which it is re
carded by every lover of decency and
truth.
TBANS-SIBEBIAN BAILWAY.
One of the most notable things in the
progress of the world at the present time
is the great plan that has been formed,
and the rapid advance of the execution of
it, by Kusiia for the construction of a
railway to connect Western Europe with
the Japan Sea. It is considered that it
will be an event as important in history
as the cutting of the Suez canal. While
we are attending to rumors of war and
reading so much about it we almost over
look tae large events of peace, which
may, in their far-reachine results of con
quest of the earth's resources for human
happiness, transcend in importance the
squabble* that threaten to waste blood
and treasure.
It is now certain that in a few years
fast trains will run from Calais to Yiadi
vostock. Early in the next century, that
is so nearly here, swift locomotives will
be transporting passengers overland to
the Orient in one-third of the time it
takes to go by Suez and the sea. The cose
of passage will likewise be reduced to
one-third of the present price, and with
this double saving of time and money
there can be no doubt travel will be
greatly increased, and consequent on the
extended communication commerce will
be stimulated and industry expanded.
Already 5000 miles of steel rails have
been laid on the great railway. Conserva
tive China has so far overcome the inertia
fixed upon her by the standstill custom of
many centuries that she has granted Rus
sia the right to build and operate the road
through Manchuria. It is estimated by
the engineers that when the road is fully
equipped the entire trip across the two
broad continents will be made in nine
days and two noun. A ticket from Lon
don to Japan to-day, via the Suez canal,
costs $428; by the new route it will be
about $119. Over a fifth of a million pas
sengers have been going annually to Aus
tralia and China via the S,uez canal, and
it is calculated that a large majority of
these will prefer to make the journey
overland in nine to twelve days rather
than spend twenty-eight to thirty-eight
days and some hundreds of dollars more
on the trip by seas.
Great as the profit of this travel would
be there is little doubt that the added
facilities will cause many more to mate
the trip. The freights that pay the high
est rates are expected to come by the
quick route. The enterprise will be so
immense a revenue-producer it is sure to
result in the keeping of this great high
way oi communication between the East
ern and Western worlds in the best con*
dition for the safe and speedy transport of
merchandise and men.
''THEIR BAOEED PLEDGES."
"The newspaper men who refuged to
break their sacred pledges Buffet for their
honor. 1 '
It is with this canting; and assumptions
phrase that the "Monaroh of Filth, Polly
and Falsehood" refers to the imprison*
ment of Long Green Lawrence and bis
more unfortunate than criminal associate,
Mr. Levin gs.
"Their sacred pledges!" What does
the unsavory and unlettered Lawrence
know of "sacred pledges"? As well
might the unmasked highwayman whine
about his "sacred pledge" not to divulge
the identity or the whereabouts of his pal.
â¢â¢Their honor"! What does this lick
spittle and spaniel ot absentee Hearst,
both of whose careers are leprous rrith Bin
and crime, know or feel of honor?
However, to turn from the unclean, it
is gratifying to the childhood, woman
hood and manhood of California to know
that these precious "newspaper men" are
not altogether insensible to shame, even
though loat to decency, and that their in*
carceration with the thugs and thieves of
a Sacra me to jiil has caused them to
"suffer."

NEWS OF FGRL.GN NAVIES.
The Star, torpedo-boat destroyer built by
Palmer's for the British navy, had a builder's
trial in February and during a three nours'
continuous run averted 31.05 knots per hour.
A serious accident occurred last month on
the British cruiser Gibraltar. While testing
the primers for the 11-inch torpedoes a pre
mature explosion took place, killing three sea
men an^d one petty officer.
Emperor William of Germany has evidently
made up his mind to have a navy second oniy
to that ol Great Britain. Last month he laid
before the Reichstag a paper explaining in his
own handwriting the relative standing of the
navies of France, Russia, United Statei, Japan
and Germany, and illustrated by six tables,
likewise prepared by himself, what tin actual
fighting force at sea of the several countries
consisted of. He grouped Russia and France
together and excluding the Black Sea fleet of
Russia found that the combined fleets of these
two countries aggregated 109 vessels includ
ing battle-ships, armored and protected cruisers
over 2000 tons. The fleets of the United
States, Japan and Germany he figured out to
be 33, 16 and 32 respectively.
Great Britain's naval expenditures have
been increasing at an extraordinary rate dur
ing the past three years and a still further in
crease is anticipated for the ensuing fiscal
year. For 1894-95 the sum expended on new
ships was $23,340,000; last year it losa to
$35,825,000. British navy building is largely
regulated by what !â¢ "ranee and Russia are do
ing in that line, and the principle is to have a
force equal to that of the two countries com
bined. Of the shipsliow in hand and not com
pleted England has eighty-eight in all, one
naif of which are torpedo-boat destroyers and
can be rapidly completed. Fire batte-ihips of
the Majestic class will be commissioned during
the present year and six second-class battle
snips are practical y completed. The present
force available for ships is 93,000 long service
and 23,000 reserve men, and these are likely
to be increased to 100,000 and 25,000 respec
tively.
An Austrian Navy Department publica
tion entitled "Mittheilungen aus dem Gebiete
dcs Seewesen," publishes at some length the
gunnery trials of United States battle-ship
Indiana March, 1896. From this account it
would appear that the Indiana was a dismal
failure. It concludes that the 8-inch guns are
unserviceable as placed and thai some of the
craw were seriously injured during the trial,
that a 4000-pound anchor was lifted bodily
by the concussion of the heavy guns and
moved several feet and that the ship sustained
considerable damage to joiner work and its
fittings. The Indiana has been in constant
commission since her gun trial last March,
and has had frequent drills of late with heavy
and lighter guns and there have been no ;e
--ports of even trifling mishaps. It is therefore
to be inferred that changes have been made
that nave remedied such defects to which all
vessels are liable on a first trial. The article
referred to is ep'.tomized in "Das Echo," a
weekly publication in Berlin, and other papers
in Europe are, no doubt, likewise getting
much comfort out of the alleged failure of the
four battle-ships, Including the lowa, which
latter, however, has not yet been tried.

NAT GOODWINS JOKE WITH
SULLIVAN.
Chicago Kecord.
When Sullivan was in his prime and was sup
posed to be the invincible champion of the
universe, he came to Chicago to play an en
gagement. Nat Goodwin was playing here at
the same time. Goodwin, like every other man
with a drop of sporting blood in his veins,
admired Sullivan. He knew him very well, as
the great actor and the great pugilist both
came from Boston.
Sullivan was standing near a fancy bar at
one of the hotels when Goodwin entered. The
usual circle of admirers were at a safe distance
from the mighty warrior, admiring him in
awe-stricken silence. Goodwin pretended not
to recognize Sullivan. Be strolled over to the
barand naked in a loud voice: "Who is that
big duffer?"
"Bh-h-h 1 That's John L. Sullivan," said the
bartender.
â¢â¢Well, what do I care?" demanded the actor,
and with that he walked over and brushed
against the fighter.
Sullivan glared down at Goodwin and roared :
"Say, who are you pushin'?"
"Oh, keep Â«ttll, you big bluff," replied Good
win.
Two or three of the spectators fainted, and
others pushed forward to save the actor's life.

backing away, appirently frightened out of

looking on ran for their lives, and never came

to assault Sullivan whenever he saw him, and
the big fighter thought it was the funniest
thing the comedian ever did.

Chairman Be sy Says That Every
thing li Ready (or a Grand ob
servaac cf the Day.
The St. Patrick's Day Convention held
its last meeting at Knights of the Red
Branch Hall yesterday afternoon.
The att' ndaiico was not as large as it
has been heretofore, for so earnestly and
enthusiastically have the delegates and
the various committees labored to maue
the celebration of next Wednesday an
event that wih be historical in its mag
nificent completeness that there remained
little to be accomplished.
John Jlulhern, who has presided over
all the meetings, occupied the chair.
Jeremiah Deasy, chairman of the com
mittee on arrangements, made a highly
gratifying report. He stated that every
thing was in perfect preparation for the
celebration, and he spoke warmly of the
faithful manner in which the various sub
committees had performed their part.
He reported that Joseph Haworth, the
eminent actor and author, had volun
teered to recite "fchamus O'Brien" at ttie
evening entertainment in the Pavilion.
At ih- alternoon exercises to be held in
Metropolitan Hall Miss Geor.'ie Stone of
the Columbia Theater had consented to
recite "The Two Thanksgivings." These
announcements were greeted with expres
sions of gra.iuule. In concluding his re
port, Mr. Deasy expressed his confidence
tnat both entertainments of the day would
transcend anything of the kind ever be
fore held in the City.
In response to a question Mr. Deasy
siated that the entire lower floor oi Me
tropolitan Hall would be reserved for tuose
who did not wish to take their chances in
a crowd. No extra charge will be made,
however, for reserved seat coupons.
P. H. Fiynn, chairman of the committee
in c arge of the sale and collection of
ticket?, reported that satislac>ory arrange
ments had been completed ior this portion
of the work.
In pursuance of an invitation received
from Father Grey an expression of the

THEIR FIRST SERVICE.
Two Italian 1 rlegts From Turin In
stalled iv Their Church.
The congregation attending divine ser
vice in Sts.Pietro c Paolo's Roman Catholic
Church yeÃterday morning were rather
surprised to rind two new priests in charge
of the church.
The new clergymen arrived in this City
last Wednesday afternoon from the parent
house at Turin, Italy, to take charge o f
the Italian parish in this City. Their
arrival here ia at the express request of
Archbishop Riordan, who had renewed a
request made by his predecessor, Arch
bishop Alemany, some twenty years ago
to the superintendent of the parent house
in Italy to snpply the Italian wants in this
Cit? with gome priests belonging to the
order of St. Francis de Sales. But at the
time tbat Bishop Alemany made this
request, the superintendent had no clergy
men to spare, consequently none came
until now, when Fathers Raphael Piperni
and the assistant pastor, the Rev. Valen
tino Cassini, have taken charge of the
Italian colony with its 30,000 inhabitants
to minister to.
Father Pippni, who speaks English
tow to-oat; ; â¢:T' : -" i

perience with just one $ thing.
We make only Scott's Emul-

well, has been a resident of Mexico for
sixiee.i years. At Paebla he established
a college of bis order and was rector of it
until two mouths ago, w en lie was re
called to the parent hou-<e In Turin, Italy,
and there received bis credentials for this
archiepiscopal aioces-e. The present Fath
ers are the first of their order in the -
United States, though in South America
and the continent of Europe there are be
tween 500 and 630 of them in various
places.
The or Itr to which these two clergymen
belong was established in Turin about
fifty years azo by Don Jean Bosco. a holy
man who rose out of the poor class of the
Italian population. He received a semin
ary education and was ordained a priest
by the Archbishop of Turin. He was a
man of ability and education and to
share these blessings with the down
trodden waÂ« his heart's desire. He gath
ered around him the wai/s of society and
in his zeal for them established his order,
the Salesians, the first object of which is
the educating of the poor and the teach
ing to them of trades, and second, the da
ties entailed in the rharee of parishes.

SKEPTICISM IN
ITS DUAL PHASE
A Powerful Sermon by
Father Prendergast at
St. Patrick's.
Beginning of the Solemn Tri
duum Ce'eb-ating ths
Silver Jubilee.
The Church a Dream cf Floral Beauty.
Inspiring: Music by the
Choir.
The deep, mellow notes of the organ in
St. Patrick's Church'last evening ushered
in the beginning of the solemn triduuni to
be held i:i celebration of the silver jubilee
of that sacred edifice, and as tbe rand,
inspiring music reverberated throughout
the spacious structure, it carried io the
minds of tbe parishioners an added sig
nificance and inspiration befitting such an
occasion.
At the hour at which services began
standing room was at a premium. Each
parishioner had received a circular letter
from the pastor, Key. P. J. Grey, notifying
him of the fact that St. Patrick's day of
this year will be the twenty-fifth anniver
sary of the dedication of the church and
the ceremonies to be held.
From a decorative standpoint the church
was indeed a dream of beauty.
Se.-vices opened by singing of the ye pers
in English by the choir. Mrs. E. Parent,
Miss Belle Higgins and Mr. Messmer, in
which tne congregation joined.
Tne .-ermon, "A Good Lite-a Preserva
tive of Fai:h," was preached by tbe Very
Rev. J. J. Prendergast, V.G., Su Mary's
Cathedral. The preacher was in excellent
voice and delivered an eloquent exhorta
tion to his hearers to follow in the straight
and narrow path which 1 ads to the en
joyment of an eternal elysmm.
Taking the life of the "Man of Galilee"
as the standard for a life of moral excel
lence, ha quoted the scripture text,
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shail see God," and then delivered him
self of words suitable to it. The sermon
was replete with illustration and also
dwelt largely on the causes and results of
skepticism.
"Why is it," he asked, "tbat men ara
unable to recognize the bon of God above
the son of man, and Hi- faith above ail
human teaching? There are two rea
sons â or, rather, sources oi doubt and un
belief â whatever you choose to call them.
One is in tbe mind and the other in tbe
heart. These force 3 sometime- work con
jointly and sometimes separately."
The former he thought a willful ten
dency to viciousness that would tear
down it possible even the throne of the
Almighty to attain its enti. The latter
was perhaps due to many causes, among
them natural depravity and environment.
If all would lead clean, pure lives the
faith necessary to salvation would abound.
The preacher advised his bearers not to
argue with an unbeliever, because it gen
erally had the effec: of making them more
sinful by giving them a chance to blas
pheme the Holy Spirit.
"Be just," he said in conclusion; 'Took
to your heavenly Father for aid and in
spiration, and when difficulties and trials
oppress you go down on your knees and
pray for strength, and faith, like a heaven
ly tore, will ever go before you and guide
your footsteps."
An offertory soprano soio and chorus
was then rendered by the choir and Mr.
Messroer followed with the tenor solo, "0
Salutaris." The ladies then sang "Tan
tum Ego" (Millet).
Father Brennan officiated in the bene
diction and was assisted by Father Keane.
The services for to-day and to-morrow
were fully published in yesterday's Cail.
JUMPED INTO THE SEA.
A Seaman, Tired of Life, Tries
to End It in the Ocean
Waves.
The Big Barbecm at the Chutes by
the Society of Old Fmnis
Draws a Crowd
There was a great crowd at the ocean
beach yesterday, but one among the
throng was not seeking pleasure. John
Hatpin, an engineer of the French steam
er Madeleine, tried to end his Jife by delib
erately walking out into the surf. He
failed in hi 3 effort, for the waves threw
nim back toward the shore, and he was
pulied out in a dazed condition, but not
much hurt.
J. Rudoiph, of 3170 Sixteenth street, a
driver of the fire department, rescued the
rash engineer and deserves much credit
for his action. The would-be suicide was
warmed up with a drink and kept briskly
walking to put his blood in circulation,
while Rudolph went to telephone for the
Park ambulance. Mounted Police Officer
fccuaeffer reached the scene before the
ambulance and took charge of the engi
neer. He says that the rescued man had
been drinking, but was t:ot drunk. He
seemed dazed for a good while, and when
he was able to talk clearly he requested
that he be sent to the hospital for a few
days.
Schaeffer proposed taking him to Sis
ship, but the man, tapping his head sgr
nificantly, said it was safer for him to be
connned in the hospital for a while, be
cause a spell might come back upon him
that would again tempt him to self-de
struction. The policeman thought he
seemed demented, and Dr. Wymore, who
went after him with the Park ambulance,
also considered him deranged. He was
Bent to the Receiving Hospital.
Halpin asked that the matter be re
ported to bis ship, but gave no reason for
wishing to kill himself. The attempt was
made opposite one of the saloons on the
beach.
The park was thronged with people en
joying the bright sunshine yesterday.
Ooe of the most attractive spots was btow
Lake, with its waves whitened here and
there by the sails of numbers of toy
yachts. They were made to cross and
recross with much swi.tness and pre
cision. The balustrade of the new bridge
is now so far completed as to show that it
will be one of the chief ornaments of the
park.
In the forenoon a boy named G. H.
Fleming of 122 Taylor street was acci
dentally struck a severe blow on the
temple with a bat. He was sent to the
Receiving Hospital, but the injury was
not considered dangerous.
At the Sutro Baths the usual aquatic
sports took place, with the addition of a
new feature by Schulte called the "drown
ing act."
A large crowd attended the Chutes, and
the Society of Old Friends made a great
success of their barbecue. They had
three roasted oxen and a number of sheep
and hogs. Tne president of this society,
Thomas Sawyer, is an old acquaintance ol
Mark Twuin, and it was from him that
t he name of "Tom Sawyer" la Twain's
,amouÂ« i tor/ was takeu. ,
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
The American Bark Carrollton, F-*om Nanaimo, B. C, Made a
Picturesque Entrance Into Port Last Friday Night. She
Did Not Fare as "Well the Following Night, However, as
She Dragged Her Anchor and Collided "With the Oregon.

The Whitehall Boatman Had Another
Exiting Race on the Bay
Yesterday.
The American bark Currolton made a
most picturesque entry info port last Fri
day, but she did not look so well yester
day morning when she was afoul of the
battle-ship Oregon. The red-stack tug
Sea King separated the two vessels ana
the Carrolton is again at her anchorage.
As the Carroiton was making the Golden
Gate the moon broke through the clouds
and showed her the way in. She was
brought to an anchor off Folsom-street
wharf, but during the night fouled her
anchor. The turn ot the tide Bet her
adrift, and the first thing the crew knew
about the accident was when she bumped
up against the Oregon. Neither vessel
was damaged to any extent and the Car
rolton will dock to-day to discharge her
cargo of coal. , i
There was another race among the boat
! men yesterday. The course was around
Blossom Rock, thence to the Presidio
buoy and back to Meiggs wharf, the start
ing : point. Those who entered â  were:
Thomas Hayden, James l< arrell, H.Ben jes,
Albert Heyer, James Bennett, John Cane,
A. O'Connell, ; Harry Johnson, Thomas
Lyons, Thomas : Murray, Dave 'i Crowley
Jr. and Dave Fitzgerald. ' Tho * race was
an exciting one from the start, ana on
several occasions the: boats were bo
bunched that a leader could not be picked.
Off the Presidio Bennett and Hayden got
into difficulties and both had to retire
from the race. Bennett carried away his
jiD-balyardÃ, and Hayden tracKed his
boom. >' > -,
The race was finally won by Dave Crow
ley Jr., with H. Ban jss 'â  second and T.
Lyons third.
V Next Sunday there will be a match race
for $50 a side between D. Crowley Br. and
W. P. Fitzeerald. v The former will sail
the new Whitehall Stewart I Menzies and
the latter will. pilot the old-time Captain

AN APPEAL TO
THE GRAND JURY
The Marble Cutters and
Finishers' Union Has a
Grievance.
No Satisfaction Can Be Had
From the Cit7 Hall Com
missioners.
Obj ctioa Is B in; Raised to tbe Scab
Work Done by the California
Travertins Company.
â¢* â 
The final charter meeting of the
Marble Cutters and Finishers' Union of
San Francisco was held yesterday after*
noon, Thomas Cbristal presiding, James
Shannon and John McCann officiating as
secretaries.
The membership-roll was Bwelied from
75 to 130, and Hereafter an admission fee
of $10 will be charged for all applicants
who are citizens or who have applied for
citizenship and $50 for all aliens. .
The union has but one serious griev
ance, according to the committee reports
turned in yesterday. It is in regard to
tbe work being done at tbe City Hali.
A committee from the union called
upon tne City Hail Commissioners last
Saturday and explained that of tbe three
contractors McCormack and Tanghi, and
the Inyo Marble Company were the only
two who were carrying out their recorded
contracts. The other concern â the Cali
fornia Travertine Companyâ was not per
forming proper work and was employing
rcab labor. The committee received no
satisfaction, Â»nd the union proposes to
swear to an affidavit showing where the
City is being mulcted to ths extent of
nearly $15,000 and ask for an investigation
by the Grand Jury.
MITCHELL THE PHENOMENON.
California BMlavdlst Will Be Backed
Against the Kaatern Players.
Mitchell, the amateur billiardist who
has been d?stingnishing himself recently
at the Occidental Hotel in the Brunswick-
BalWe-Collender Company 14-inch bÂ«lk
line tournament, seems to have all his
own way for the main trophy. Heinecke,
the only other scratch man, is a victim of
stage fright and has not been able before
an audience to play anywhere near h!s
usual form.
Captain Williams, representing the
Brunswick-Baike-Collender Company of
Chicago in this City, contemplates get
ting Napoleon lyes, Jake Scbaefer and
Slosson out here as soon as their Eastern
engagements are at an end, and Mitchell
will be played against them.
The young Californian nas been playing
a phenomenal balk-line game and he is
improving every day. It is confidently
expected that within a few months he
will be fully able to take care ot his end
even with the Eastern cracks.
The tournament will be resumed to
night.

-*â¢ the vital powers, the direct causa of thousands of cases of general nervous ex-

perhaps the most dangerous of the many results of early indiscretions, It drains the

have tried every known means in their attempts to cure it, and have usually given it
up with the advice that it will not be a serious matter. But this is only their way of

CYCLE RACERS
MADE FAST TIME
Road Events and Relay
Try-Outs of Some Wheel
ing Clubs.
R. A. Coulter of the California
Club Covered Ten Miles
in 27:04
\
The Imp?rial, A!.m da, Bay C ty,
Olympic and California Clnbs
AH Held Races.
The annual 100-mile relay race of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs will
be held Sunday, April 4, and will be con*
tested between probably twelve clubs this
year. These clubs are preparing and se
lecting tlieir ten-men teams now, and al
most every Sunday sees some road races
or "try outs" held to test the speed and
endurance of the candidates ior positions
on the teams.
Yesterday there were five of these
events, three being over the Fruitvale
flaywards course and two over the third
relay, through San Mateo and San Carlos.
The Imperial Cysling Club's race had
the most starters and the most accidents
and is therefore wo: thy of tirst mention,
although the California Club made the
fHstest time. The Imperial's was a ten
mile handicap ride, and to spur the riders
on to greater efforts a goodly crizelist
was hung up, a feature that was lacking
in the races held by ihe other clubs.
They started from High street, Fruit
vale, at 11 a. m , and three of the scratch
men â Lind, Maack and tiozio â finished in
27 mm. 29 sec, though the timers sep
arated them by fifth* and there was a dif
ference of inches tetween them. Two
other scratch men â Uarley and Cook â
a.et with an accident and finished nearly
last. Egan and Corny also fell, but bor
rowed other wheels and finished well up
in the bunch.
The following is the summary:
The officials of the Imperial race were:
W. H. Tooker. referee; George J. Panario, E.
F. Flinn, Joseph Catanich, judges; Jrnnes
Lynch, Godfrey Edwards, J. I. JaggUne,
timers: G. Sullivan, G. Roche, starters; \V.
Macfarlane, J. T. Lynch, marshal*; E. W.
Schneider. C. Troliiet, Arthur Nelson, G. H.
Pecht, G. Ward, F. A. Biedman, scorers.
The other two events over the Hay
wards course were tbe relay try-outa of
the Olympic Club Wheelmen and Ala
mertu Cyclers. Considerable speed was
shown by some of tbe men in each.
Kragnejs made tbe fastest time for tbe
Olympics, 28:30. and E. F. Ilus3 was sec
ond best with 29:00, ihe others being close
behind him.
The California Cycling Club's event was
over the third relay, from San Mateo to
Menlo Park. Tbe riders fought a strong
wind a uart of the way, but this did not
seem to effect them much, for remarkably
good time was made. Each man rode
alone and unpaced, and Coulters time ot
27:04 was very fast under the conditions.
The following is the table:
The Bay City Wheelmen held a five
mile handicap race from San Maieo to
San Carlos. C. \V. Still won, with tnree
minutes' Handicap, and Charles A. Kraft
made best time, 12:27.
The agreeable weather yesterday drew
crowds of wheelmen to the park. Many
have not ventured country riding yet,
though the roads are now in very lair
condition.
The indoor tournament which is to
open at tho Mechanics' Pavilion next
Saturday night has excited considerable
interest among the local riders ana a large
number of entries aye bean sent in. No
entries will be received after to-morrow
night. Full particulars of the meet were
given in The Call last Saturday.
NO MORE LEAGUE.
A New Organization of Cyclers to
Be Formed on This Coast.
The movement that was started and
toos root among the wheelmen some six
years ago has matured and become fruit
ful and within a few days the cycling
clubs of this City and, in fact, all over the
Htate will have separated from the League
of American Wheelmen and formed an
organization of their own.
Though the league has a large member
ship in California there has always been
dissatisfaction because ot the few benefits
derived, and it has been with the ntmost
difficulty thai the league membership in
this State was kept np.
Tbe refusal of the league to sanction
Bunday racing was the last straw that
"broke the camel's back," and within a
short time 1000 California members will
refuse to renew their membership, and
many have already done so.
. The league on this coast is dead, and
Phoenix-like a new organization has risen
and wheeling interests will not suffer.
The plan now being dismssed is to form
a Siate organization with the California
Associated Cycling > lubs as a basis, and
gradually widen its scope until it takes
t. c place of the league.
A meeting wi.l be held at tbe club
house of t.ie Bay City Wheelmen on Fri
day evening next at which the plan will
be matured and definite arrangements
made
Forth- present tbe only change con
templated in tbe by-laws of the organiza
tion is the insert on of a clause providing
for a committee on track racing, a matter
which is not now recognized by tbe asso
ciation.
Delegates from all of tbe prominent
clubs in tbe State will be present, and as
all are in line on the question of discon
tinuing their membership to tbe league it
is not expected tbat there will be any
hitch in the proceedings.
The Assoi latod Cyiing Clubs is the most
successful organization of the kind ever
formed in America, and the success of the
past augurs well for the future. There
are now nineteen clubs, with an aggregate
membership of 1600 enrolled, and this will
likely be increased as the objects of tbe
new movement are known.
The association does not anticipate re
fusais on the Dart of the feague because of
tbe withdrawals, but if the records of the
new organization should be refused appli
cation will bo made to tbe Amateur Ath
letic Association, and its sanction will be
quite as satisfactory as that of tbe league.
Colorado, New Mexico and wheelmen
from all other States have tbe same griev
ances against the league as those of Cali
fornia, and it is expected tbat they will
follow in the wake of the < yclists of this
State. An alliance of tbe Western Stales
and Territories is not improoabie, with a
mutual understanding as to rules. This
would answer all the purposes now served
by the leacue.
At the next regular meeting of the
Imperials, this evening, the Olympic
cup, which was won by them in
the recent 25-mile roa<d race, will be pre
sented by President Swain of tbe Asso
ciated Clubs, and the prizes won in the
Imperials' road race of to-morrow will also
be distributed. Tbe social committee has
prepared a little entertainment, so that a
visit to tne clubrooms this evening will be
well repaid.
THE THEATRICAL WORLD.
An Idea of What la to Be Offered to
lhose Who Hay Wish to Go to
I'lay-llousea To-Ni B ht.
To-night there will be presented at the
Baldwin Theater for the first time "Gis
mondn," by Sardou, which has been produced

Melbourne MacDowell.
"The Foundling" Is what is to be offered at
the Columbia Theater this evening. .It is a
play thathad an unusually long run in New
York and it is spoken of as "a jolly success."

eye, will appear and show how she dances.
The company at the Alcazar Theater will
this evening continue "Jim the Penman,
which during the past week proved so great a
success. The continuing of a piece on the
boards more than a week at this house is
against the rules, but that is such an attrac
tion that rules must go.
At tho Grand Opera-house there will be
piacedou the boards "The Eagle's Nest," a
scenic production that contains many start
ling situations and a mixture of comedy,
pathos, specialties and music There is in
the melodrama a wonderfully exciting duel
scene.
At the Tivoli there will be a continuance
thisevening of that nautical opera,"Uer Majes
ty's Ship pinafore," which has awaltenod an
old-time interest in the lovers of light music.
It Mill be presented with the same cast as that
of last week.
To-night a new specialty 1b to be offered at
the Urrheuru. It is the four Cohans, who
style themselves the "automatic doll -dancers."
It will be their first appearance, and there
will also appear for the first time Keating and
Walker, the dancing comedians. There are
other specialties.
At the Chutes there will be the usual num
ber of striking attractions for those who fancy
outdoor amusements. There are the chutes,
the trolley and the scenic railway, in addition
to many other special features that are appre
ciated.
There is not to be any performance at the
California to-night, but to-morrow night there
will be presented by the French opera troupe,
for the first time in this City, Beyer's "Sigurd,"
witn a strong eas; and ballet. It Is a story of
mortals and demigods.
The Armenian Question.
An interesting and instructive lecture will
be Riven on the Armenia-Turkish question at
the Younn Men's Christian Association Audi
torium, Mason and Ellis streets, this (Monday)
evening at 8 o'clock. The lecture, by Rev.
Haskett Smith, will treat of tne country, its
people and customs aud the present unsettled
conditions. Ue has several times visited Con
stantinople and will lecture from personal
observation, throwing several interesting
views of the country on the screen by means
of a stereopticon.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
But One Important Sale
Effected During the
Past Week.
On Every Hand in This City
BuildiDg Is in Prog
ress.
A Feeling cf Confiienc* SÂ» mi to
Prevail Among P rsoas Id?niifi.d
With Property Interests.
Agents continue to report an improved out
look for the real estate market, though mat
ters have not yet assumed that rosy hue
which accompanies a brisk movement in
realty.
There is a strong holding on the part of real
estate owners, so that bargain-hunters have
circumstances against them. A feeling of con
fidence seems to prevail among persons iden
tified with property interests. People who are
buying a home by monthly payments care
little for the condition of tha market. Large
and wealthy operators are apparently less con
cerned as to whether Drices move up or down.
It is quite certain that some of their prop
erty will De sacrificed. They are satisfied mat
real estate will par good Interest on the cost
price, though it may lake a little longer time
to realize than expected.
On every hand in this City building is in
progress. Street improvements of no small
magnitude are being made, while much land
is being graded and put in shape for huilding,
which a few years ago was an inaccessible from
the center of the City as is Sun Jose at the
present time. And on these newly graded lots
homes are being built for people in moderate
circumstances. Without reference to anyone
particular neighborhood, anyone who will put
in a day riding or walking about the outlying
S"Ctions w ill see hundreds of house; of this
cUt s in coune of construction.
When werkingmen are buying homes for
their families and builders are putting ud
houses to sell on long credit, the promise for
the future is cood.
Flat houses are also noticeable by their fre
quency, and it is remarkable how quicklr
they are rented. People want to live in
houses with the more modern ganitarv ar
rangement.--, and owners of old. dilapidated
structures are being compelled to rebuild If
they desire to hold their tenants.
A little attention on the part of owners to
outside aprearancc and within fixing?, with
some changes in plumbing end drainage,
would likely have contented many a tenant
and saved owners more or less loss in the way
of rents. It pays to improve when times are
dull, and this fact, perhaps, is the best argu
ment to capital to come out from the cash
box or hiding-pace.
As to the building of new houses.lt enn al
most safely be said that there is no danger of
suitable structure* remaining idle after their
completion. The City will move forward, her
commerce will grow and expand, while her
population is likely to mcrease in numbir lut
tif.ent to satisfy even the most pronounced
optimist.
The most important sale effected during the
week in local realty was the property situated
on the southwest corner of Van Kens avenue
and O'Fxrrell street for$00,00<Â». The lot has
a fronlaee of 120 feet on Van Ness, extending
from O'Farrell street to Olive, avenue, and a
depth of 178:6 on O'Farrell street. There are
three dwellings on the Van Ness avenve front,
worth about $5000. There is a vacant space
of 70x120 feet in the rear on O'Farrell street.
Segregating this portion and deducting the
value of the improvements, Madison & Burke,
who were the broker?, estimate the price r>afd
for the Van Ness avenue frontage at $340 a
foot.
The following, from Edwards' Criterion, is a
summary of the real estate sales in this City
from January 1, 1897, to January 31. 1897, in
clusive:
Noteâ Toe total number of deeds recorded was
438. but of this number *14 were quitclaim deeds,
gifts ana funnily transactions, deeas in correction,

Have Little Use for Dress
Suits.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 14. j
At the annual banquet of the Alarneda
Medical Association held la?t week. Miss
Mollie Conrjors, the bright editor of
Oakland Saturday Night who wa3 one of
Ihe guests, made a speech which has set
social apd professional circles a-thinking.
In the course of her remarks she said:
"This bright element gathered about the
festive board is never s?en in what are
called 'society circles.' Yet it is the one
element needed â this comradeship, this
i: tod-fellowship, in fact, the real depth of
i incipie and worth to be found in young
who have struggled, worked and
.-â¢. udied and made a success in their
chosen profession; but in our so-called
social gatherings, this element is almost
never seen."-
A* these wordÂ» were delivered, the
speaker faced an intelligent gathering, of
young doctors, young lawyers and other
young men whose brains are the founda
tion of their wealth.
The publicity given to the speech has
brought out many expressions of opinion,
and la.st night a writer who evidently
thinks it safe to hide behind a nom-de
plume, published some very caustic re
marks.
"In the first place," he say;, "these
roung men of brains are not invited.
Neither the Deux Temps nor the cotillion
list ever contains their names. A few peo
ple make up the general list, which rumor
says has come down from time imme
morial with but few additions. Some of
us young lawyers, young doctors and
others would not object to getting into a
dress-suit occasionally and dancing with
Oakland's beautiful maidens, but so far
this has been denied us."
Then comes a long complaint that the
chaperons of the Deux Temps Club send
all their invitations out to Berkeley, aud
their parties are consequently a gathering
of eligible young ladies with students who
are sacrificing their studies for the
pleasure of a fleeting association with so
ciety. .
These young men from Berkeley are an
unknown quantity in Oakland's profes
sional circles. Presumably they are not
wanted any more than Oakland's young
men are wanted by the chaperons of the
social clubs. But the complaint goes a
great deal further and says that the reason
there are so few engagements and so few
new homes in Oakland is because the love
making days of Oakland's best girls are
thrown away upon a passing element
which only comes to Berkeley tor a few
\ years and then goes off instead of enter
\ ing into an acquaintance with the resident
wealth of brain, which alone can lay the
foundation of true society.
These are very serious insinuations, and
when placed before a leading student at
Berkeley to-day he said there was practi
cally no defense to their position. "I
have been to ten dances in Oakland this
last season," he said, "and on no occasion
have I ever been sufficiently acquainted
with the young ladies with whom I danced
to feel that I was obligated to send a car
riage for her cr to take the trouble to see
her home. We received the invitations
und we considered that we were showing
enough gallantry by riding to Oakland on
it street car and devoting two or three
hours to the amusement of the girls. Most
of us, however, pay our dues to these
clubs and naturally feel that we are en
titled to the invitation."
This subject is going to stir up other
elements than the young men. lor to-day
several bright young ladieu expressed their
opinions. They desired to know why the
brain of stenographers, artists and lady
journalists were not just as deserving of
recognition by society as when owned by
youne men.
This ebullition in social and professional
Circles will probably result in the forma
tion of a new social element which will
uÂ«e for its coat of arms, "Brains Before
Wealth."
During the next week the edtor that
started the ball rolling will need a special
clerk to attend to her correspondence.
While the subject of Oakland's young
men is under discussion it will not be
amiss to carry it a little further. During
the paat two years some of the young
men of this city have made reputations as
judges and legislators that rank on a level
with those of older men. In this regard
Hart North of the Assembly has been as
prominent at Sacramento as any other
legislator on the floor. He has been in
strumental in advocating to a successful
lend many bills of benefit to this county.
Aihe same is true of Frank L9avitt, an-
Assemblyman from this district,
" vho was never Ueard of In politics until
he made bis debut in the Legislature. J.
W. Clark of Niles, who is not long out of
the university, did some good work on
behalf of good roads, and Oscnr Breiling
and Howard Wright, two other young
men from this city, have also done good
service.
On the Superior bench two years ago
Juiige Frick was appointed, and his judi
cial career was one of marked ability, and
he showed his strength in popular favor
by the strong rignt he made at the prima
ries against Congressman Hilborn. Judge
Wood of the Police Court, who truthfully
can be said to look like a mere youth,
earned the respect of voters to such an ex
tent that after one term of office he was
enabled to run independently and beat the
regular Republican nominee.
The District Attorney's office has very
important and intricate questions to han
dle all the time, and irorn Attorney Snook
down to the latest deputy all have estab
lished their claim to be able lawyers, and
every one is a young man.
And because'tbis class of young men is
rarely seen at so-called social gatherings
the questions are asked, "What is Oakland
society? Who are its leaders? Who make
out Its treasured lists? By wha; right and
title do these people bold office? Is it by
virtue of money or intellect, or have they
been born to the pnrple?" Wiibin the
next few days there will be many answers
to these questions. Stuart W. Booth.
LEFT THE OLD CHURCH.
; H, Ti James Small and Congregation
.Hare Vacated the Building; Where
'. ' They Worshiped So Long.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
. 908 Broadway, March 14. )
Rev. James Small preached his last ser
mon to-day at the First Christian Church,
Thirteenth and Market streets.; To-mor
row the building will be formally turned
over to the new : owners, : the Swedish
Methodists, and the Christian Society will
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
worship for a time in the Y. M. C. A.
building,
The church just vacated by the society
was organized many years ago when B. F.
Regan of -silver-mining fame was one of
its members. He built a church for the
-ociety at Fifteenth and Clay streets and
for two years worshiped there. Mr.
Regan made one little error which cost
the congregation their church. He failed
to deed the building to the society, and
one day while uiivins a colt around hi 3
home, which is now the Temescal Blind
Home, the animal became frightened and
ran off. Regan was thrown to the street
and sustained a fracture of the skull from
which he died.
The estate was much involved and Mrs.
Regan offered to sail the church to the
Christian Society for $10,000. The offer
was rejected and the building vacated to
day was erected. The o d Regan church
is now known as the Asbury Methodist
Cliurch.
Dr. Will Porter was the first pastor of
the Christian Society, then came Dr.
George Sweeny, after him Rev. J. M.
Monroe, then Rev. David Wetzel, who
died soon after coming to Oakland. He
was succeeded by the present pastor, Rev.
James Small ot lowa, who has been very
popular in the pastorate.
\V. C. Gibb-i of the < flicial board said
to-day: "The location ot our church was
injurious to its pio.Â«perlty as it was far
removed from the residences of the bulk
of its membership. We will occupy the j
Y. M. C. A. Hall until we buiht a central
tabernacle. There will be no union with
the Central Christian Church, but each
congregation will worship separately, as
in the past."
PIRE IN EAST OAKLAND.
Faint Shop anil Carriage Works De
stroyed on Thirteenth Avenue.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 14 âAnother
paint shop was destroyed by fire in East
Oakland to-night, as was also a carriage
factory and a cottage. The total loss will
exceed $5000.
Shortly after 6 o'clock an alarm was
turned in at Thirteenth avenue, and a few
minutes later a general alarm was
sounded. The paint shop of B. Bangle
was discovered in flames, and owing to the
nature of the contents the whole building
was soon burning.
The paintshopis in the rear of Norther's
Carriage Works and the flames rapidly
spread to the factory. A fresh breeze
blowing helped to spread the flames and
the department had a bard job for about
half an hour before they had the fire
under control.
In a cottaee adjoining the carriage-shop
Mrs. Barnum, an old lady, was confined
to her ted with rheumatism. The fire
reached the roof of the cottage and it was
blazing merrily when Deputy Constable
Robinson and Jack Bray rushed in and
carried out the sufferer. â  ;-./. â¢'-..-;
The origin of the fire Is attributed to
spontaneous combustion. In a stable sur
rounded by flames were two cows, and
their rescue was attended with some ex
citement. The hair on one of the animals
was afire and had to be put out by a
splash from a nozzle. This was the sec
ond general alarm within twenty-four
hours.
To Distribute the Patronage.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 14,â 1t is now
generally understood that 'the patronage
of the Board of Works will be distributed
as follows: Mayor Thomas tne Street De
partment, Engineer Clement the Fire De
partment and City Attorney Dow the Po
lice Department. This probably means
that Chief of Police Lloyd will be retained,
that ex-Chief Lawton will go back to the
Fire Department and A. M. Benham will
be Superintendent of Streets.
Young Men's Republican Club.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 14.â Notices
were sent out to-day for a special meeting
of the Young Men's Republican Club, to
be held in Judge Clift's courtroom to
morrow night. Business of special im
portance will be transacted and a full at
tendance is desired.
Out of All Danger.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 14.â Mrs. Hat
tie McDonald, the ex-matron of the Re
ceiving Hospital, is now out of all danger
from her poisoned arm. Mrs. Burnett
has been appointed as her successor and
Mrs. McDonald will leave the hospital
April 1.

all over the country in single- tax circles.
PROF. HOWISON EXPLAINS.
He Say* That Religions Are Not at All
Antagonistic When Bightly
Understood.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 14.âPro
fessor Howison has taken exception to the
synoptical report of hi& article on "Agnos
ticism and the Higher Human Interests,"
and wishes that the following be said in
relation to it:
The object of the whole article Is to show
that philosophy and religion are really not an
tagonistic at all when both are rightly under
stood. To do this, I begin in my article by
saying that, at the first view, tnere is an ap
parent (not a real) antagonism between the
principle of religion and the principle of phil
osophy. I then go on to declare that I do not
share in the belief tnat this opposition is real
and permanent, and to indicate the real basis
upon which the reasoner must proceed who
would vindicate religion from the peculiar
assaults brought upon it by modern agnostic
philosophy. In doing this I criticize iv pass
ing the insufficient methods of the current
religious apologetics.
In the course of the artie'e I allude natural
ly to complaints made by many friends of
religion that our universities are considera
bly infected witn religious indifference, owing
to the prevalence of agnosticism. Referring
to the opinion held by some that this comes
from philosophical teaching, 1 point out that
such is not the case, but thai the fact, so far
as it exist!!, ig owing to a prevalent miscon
ception of the teachings of science and of the
scientific method.
Anotner implication is that I am replying
in my article to recent attacks by a few of the
clerey. This is not the case at all. Tne per
sons really aimed at in my article are a con
siderable number of Btudents in the uni
versities, who affect agnostic views in re
ligion and profess to argue tnem from what
they cail the "principles of science." My ob
ject is to show these young people that sci
ence does uot support their views at all, and
that the sort of philosophy which they follow
is exceedingly incomplete, ana that if they
pursued philosophy to its full conclusion 'hey
wou d be carried far beyond their present
hasty way of tiiinking, coming to know that
the cardinal doctrines of religion are the pro
foundest and the surest certainties.
WANT AETESIAN WATER.
A Well to Be Sunk as an Experiment
In Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Cal,, March 13.-A move
ment is on foot, backed by the Town Trus
tees and A. A- Riohardsoa, a hydraulic
engineer of North Berkeley, to experiment
within the town with a view to ascertain
ing whether artesian water can be secured
for a towr. supply.
Mr. Richardson has made examination
of local wells and expresses the opinion
that there is a stream below the surface,
running from the Sierras to the ocean,
that will furnish an abundance of water,
and he has outlined a plan whereby the
town may establish and conduct a plant
01 its own.
''With thirty-two four-inch wells situated
about fifteen feet apart I tliinJt we could
secure a flow of 3,000,000 callous per day,"
said Mr. Richardson. "The water might
be pumped into a reservoir in the hills
having a capacity of about 10.000,000 gal
lons, and situated 350 or 400 feet above the
level of the pumping works, which would
be suitably located at University avenue
and Magee stn-Â«t, between East and West
Berkeley. Such a reservoir could be con
structed for about $20,000, and the whole
plan, providing not only pumping plant
but mains and pipe* for all the town,
coold be carried out ior about 1350,000." j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY. MARCH 15, 1897.
DAVIE'S FRIENDS
WILL RECOUNT
Sensations Promised at the
Official Recount
To-Night.
Captain Thomas' Friends Ex
press Their Confidence in
the Result.
All Sorts of Serious Charges Being
Made and the Council Will
Investigate.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 14. f
To-morrow evening the City Council
will meet to canvass the vole of there
cent election, and some sensations of
varying degree are promised.
The chief interest, of course, is cen
tered in the vote for Mayor. Since the
unofficial returns were received all kinds
of rumors have been circulated regarding
the illegality of the election board and the
errors made in the count.
It was stated that the majority of
Thomas over Davie is 95, but the friends of
Davie assert to-day that they have ob
tained figures from the election officers
which show that the majority is but 37.
All kinds of objections will probably be
made to the Council. In the First Ward
it is said there were two men on the elec
tion board that could neither read nor
write. At a precinct in East Oakland one
man has expressed his willingness to
make an affidavit that he saw tw-.nty votes
stamped for Davie called oui as being for
Thomas. Another report is to the effect
that some of the tally sheets, of whioh
there are two from each precinct, do not
agree and that the Council will be unable
to decide which of the two to accept. It
is further stated that from at least three
precincts the officers of election did not
sign their returns.
While there is no doubt that a good
deal of what is being said may be without
foundation, some of it is true, and it was
stated to-day authoritatively that the
friends of Mayor Davie and others who
had bet large amounts on the election will
demand a recount after the official can
vass.
Mayor Davie said to-day that he had
already refused to listen to all the rumors
that have been circulated regarding irreg
ularities ana fraudulent counting and had
stated that he would not move for a re
count. He admittcl, however, that there
were many interested parties who were
working to secure evidence enough on
which to satisfy themselves thai a re
count would change the result.
"I am taking no hand in it at all," said
the Mayor, "and have so Btated, but if
others are not satisfied and are willing to
pay to have their doubts set at rest by a
recount I shall have nothing to say, for it
is a right of every citizen to have the bal
lots counted if he has the money to pay
the expense."
The friends of Mayor-elect ThomaÃ
plac6 no reliance in any of the rumors.
They express their confidence that if the
ballots should be recounted the majority
of Thomas is more likely to be increased
than decreased.

IN THE HANDBALL COURTS
Ex - Alderman Dunne of New
York, the Veteran, Plays
in Two Games.
He and T. F. Bonnet Defeat Donnelly
and Lenihan and Kilgallon
and Lenihan.
Admirers of handball crowded the San
Francisco court yesterday afternoon and a
large number could not be accommodated
with seats. The attraction was ex-Alder
â  man James Dunne "of New Yort, the old
time partner of Phil Casey, the champion
handball player of the world, who was
scheduled to take part in two games.
In the first game ex-Alderman Dunne
and T.F. Bonnet played against P. T.
Donnelly, the amateur champion, and 11.
Lenihan, the overhand swiper. When
Donne made hit appearance he received
a flattering ovation. He is 65 . years of
age, but with his athletic frame and
ruddy complexion he looks twenty years
younger. ."â¢â  -'. ; .'
His style of playing was a revelation.
He never lost. his coolness even in the
most rapid rallies and took the most dif
ficult balls with grace and dexterity. He
seemed to be able to figure out just where
a ball would go and he was always found
waiting for it. Hid tossing is hard with
out any apparent effort. ;â  ; -
The first game, which was the belt two
out of three, was probably the finest seen
in the court. -.-, Dunne, Bonnet, Donnelly
and Lenihan were in splendid condition,
and it was seen from the start that each
team played to win. Th Â» pace was ter
rific. '.'.'..-. ':-
Dunne and Bonnet won the first game,
and Donnelly and Lenihan the second.
Shortly after the commencement of the
third Donnelly's right : hand struck tne
wall of the court while trying to hit a
ball with : such force as to draw blood,
which handicapped him,' and he and his
partner los. the game. r, .
M. J. Kilgallon took Donnelly's place in
the second game, which was the best three
out of five. It was a rattling came, . but
the veteran and . Bonnet won by three
games to . two. - John Riordan, the coast
champion, was scorer and referee in both
games. ' ,

The Grand Lodee of California was in
stituted, on the 24th of March, 18S0, and
this had under its jurisdiction nlty-four

there were 131 initiations and forty-eight

years 7 months and 21 nays, ami an ayer
a^e aue of death wa's 54 years 8 months
and 2 days. The average duration of the

months and 10 days.
The amount paid to beneficiaries in 1895

By Caustic Resolution the Cali
fornia Labor Convention
Protests
The Senate Will Be Petitioned to
Grant Counties Loca' Option
in Tcxttion.
"A dollar a day is entirely too small an
amount to be paid the men who will be
given work on the boulevard. "
That was the decision of ttie California
labor convention beld at 915)4 Market
street yesterday. A drastic resolution was
adopted censuring all who had any hand
in determining the rate, but not until a
prolonged and heated debate, lasting
nearly two hours, had resulted irom the
reading of the document by the secretary.
As soon as the routine business of the
body was finished the resolution following
was introduced by P. H. McCarthy:
Whereas, A number of charitable citizens
have, in their endeavors to alleviate the suf
ierings of the vast liorde of starving unem
ployed in this City and County, given freely
of their means, to the end that immediate re
lief be given to those whose families are now
suffering from the actual pangs of hunger;
and, whoreas, those people who have so sjener
ousiy subscribed to this fund are in a majority
of instances employers of labor, to whom they
pay at least enough to keep body and soul to
gether; and. whereas, we believe them to be
as generous with that which they give to sweet
charity as they are in the management of
their own private business; and, whereas, we
believe lhat no man can do a hard day's work
without being properly cared for, at least hav
ing seme.hing to eat which possesses the ordi
nary nutriment of solid and wholesome food;
and, whereas.it ranks amongst the impossi
bilities for a man to support himself and fam
ily on $1 per day, giving himself the three
meals a day which he must have if he is to
work-hard; and, whersas, we believe every
man is in the spirit of the laws of these United
States entitled to fair and just treatment, par
ticularly when endeavoring to live as a peace
ful citizen within the limits of the same;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That we, the California State Labor
Convention, in regular meeting assembled, do
hereby condemn the methods of the so-called
construction committee in their endeavor to
build as much boulevard as possible with
starving and poverty-stricken labor instead of
paying at least living wages out of that fund
given for charity, and that we consider this a
gmva insult to free American labor, which
was only a few months ago promised so much
prosperity ; and De it further
Xetolved, That the convention appoint a com
mittee of three to wait on his honor, the
Mayor, who appointed the general committee,
from which the construction, or rather destruc
tion, committee was appointed, and ascertain
if his views axe incorporated in the decision
of that destruction committee, and that said
committee from this convention be author
ized to call on Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
and request him to enforce the law which
deals with this case; and be it further
EesolvcU That a copy of these resolutions bo
published in the dai.v presÃ.
Ed Rosenberg, representing the Sailors'
Union of the Pacific, was the first speaker.
He was in favor of the rejection of the
resolution on the ground that the proposi
tion of building the boulevard is a private
charitable movement, although he was
perfectly willing for the convention to go
on record as opposed to a wage of $1 a day,
whicti, he believed, would be an unwise
precedent in the establishment of what
sum men should be paid in any capacity.
McCarthy immediately arose to cham

pion his resolution. He declared that it
was a public work, because the deed made
by ex-Mayor fcutro ha 1 been made to 'he
City and County. Furthermore, he be
lieved that any man could aff >rd to give a
piece of land away for a boulevard when

George Lafayette was stroncly in favor
cf the resolution as a whole. He a'so used
pretty strong language in malting the fact
known.
O her members took a part and a fust
and furious debute followed. The Jesuit
was a tie vote on the proposition of cit
ing out the clause relerrtd to. A vote of
10 to 2 resulted in ihe adoption of tiie reso
lution as a whole.
More trouble resulted over the report of
the commutee on tue mass-nieetiut: held
at Metropolitan Temple Feuruarv 28. Ttio
majority report of John Hill, I*. H. Mc-
Carthy, George Lafayette and Secretary
Guy L'lthrop was iavorable.
Ed Rosenberg gnve a minority report,
he having withdrawn from the committee
because ue objected to certain things,
aniuus them a speech made at the mass
meeting made by James Kose, president
of the convention. Between his rulings
against Rosenberg and the antics of a del
egate who was openly charged with nav
lng looked upon the wine when it was
red, Chairman Rose found it necessary to
brinx into play all his Napoleonic ability
as a parliamentarian.
C. Â£. Hawkes created another commo
tion by rising and entering a protest
against some action he understood was
going to be taken by .the committee in de
nouncing certain persons after seeing
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald. It waa
denied that such report was true.
The following committee was appointed
to audit the accounts of the convention:
C. Â£. Hawkes, Ed Rosenberg and Messrs.
Hoey, Hiil and Shuupert.
At the desire of H. Pieace and 11. Neid
linger the following committee was ap
pointed to render at the next meeting a
synopsis of the acts of the present Legis
latuie as re ards iabor bills: C. E.
Hawkes, George Lafayette, T. Lenergan,
W. McArthur, J. Walters, H. Myers, J.
Hill, H. Pieace and D. G. Poole.
Mr. Pieace. who is an ardent single
tazer, moved that the secretary be atuhor
ized to send the President of the Senate a
communication, to be read in open ses
sion by the clerk, requesting that body to
vote for bill 40, granting local option for
counties in the matter of taxation. The
bill has already passed the Assembly.
The motion prevailed.
The convention then adjourned to meet
next Sunday at 1:30 p. m., at which time
important matters will be brought ior
ward for consideration.

ON THE TRAIL
OF THE OCCULT
Psychical Society Girds It
self to Delve After
the Unseen.
it Moves, Elects Ofic?rs and
Appoints Investigating
Committees.
Ghosts, Thought Transferenc?, Clair.
voyance and Hypnotism Will Be
Carefully Studied.
The California Psychical Society, at tbe
age of one year, has pulled itself together,
aud with new life and energy has set about
its proper work of making bold and seri
ous excursions into the stranee realm of
the occuit â into the hidden mysteries of
phosts, rappings, "second-sight, 11 thought
transference, hypnotism, clariaudience I
and the like.
Committees of some of San Francisco's
leading citizens have just begun system
atic investigations of hypnotism and tele
pathy or thought transference, and other
committees of the society's members will
soon be organized and working along
other lines. A great many hypnotic sub
jects and all sorts of people seeming to
have strange powers and strange experi
ences will be secretly and carefully
studied.
They will be quietly gathered from amid
the life of San Francisco, which seems so
full of occultism of every sort ever
dreamed of, and especially from the large
number of people who do not know
strange things, but who go about their \
life and business without saying anything
about it or linking themselves with any of
the long list of societies founded on things
xnvstic.
The Psychical Society was organized
ov*r a year ago, and its membership of
about a hundred was made up of leading
professional, business and scientific men
who felt some interest in the immaterial
things generally bunched as "occult," and
who believed that whatever truth about
them could be gained by man was worth
seeking by strictly scientific methods.
Dr. G-eorge M. Terrill became president
and J. Dalzeil Brown, cashier of the Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company,
secretary. David Starr Jordan and s^nie
otner prominent university men expressed
at least a tolerant sympathy with the aims
cf the society, but aid not actively asso
ciate themselves with it. The so
ciety engaged for one year as lecturer J.
J. Morse, an eminent spiritualist of Lon
don, who returned in December. During
the year the society pursued little if any
original research and its elegant quarters
in the Wenb-in buiiding on Sutter street !
were not often enlivened.
But original research which shall afford {
evidences of the truth or falsity of alleged j
occult phenomena and impartial evidence
of the circumstances, methods, conditions, I
etc., of them is the chief avowed purpose
of psychical societies, among which the
ones at London and Boston are the only
ones which have achieved much fame
and dignity. Both of these societies en
roll distinguished scientific and profes
sional men. Trre great physicist. Pro
fessor Crookes, who gave the -world the
Crookes tube, was last year president of
the London society, and Professor James
of Harvard has led the w< rk ot the Boston
society. These societies have published
many large volumes of transactions which
are full of wonderful things.
It has been the ambition of the most
active members of the local society to do
what the London and Boston societies are
doing, to plunge into the mystical un
known and make detini:e contributions to
psychical science which shall give the
society some value and fame.
That was the i-pirit in which the annual
election was held v few days ago. The di
rectors elected were: James Treadwell,
the mining millionaire, B M. Bradford,
secretary of the Alameda and San Joaquin
(Corral Hollow) Railroad, J. Daizell
Brown, Attorney Maurice V. Samuels,
Jo^e Costa, Consul for Uruguay, Walter
J. Bartnett and R. D. Fry, capitalist.
These directors will in a few days elect
officers.
Delinquents were dropped, ana the
members remaining numbered eigty-five.
The library was moved into the Em
porium bailding and a librarian engag;d.
It is nroposed to hnve monthly lectures
by eminent men, and at the end of the
year to publish transactions which shall
give the chief results of tbe investigations
made.
Investigating will be done by commit
tees, each committee taking a special sub
ject. The ne;v committee on hypnotism
consists of twenty members, and it has al
ready heid two interesting sessions.
Several of the members have privately be
come expert hypnotists, Â«o that no pro
fessionals are called in. J. Dalzeil Brown
is especially interested in this subject, and
U an expert operator himselt.
Hypnotism is the only one of the things
to be studied which has achieved recogni
tion in the general scientific world after
being so long classed with witchcraft and
demonology, but there is a limitless field
for study and discovery in this strange
thing, and the psychical society is goin"
to dig into its mysteries. One of thÂ°
problems which the committee will study
according to one of its members, is the
possibility of clairvoyant powers being
developed in a subject by the influence of
hypnotism.
Tie committee on telepathy is just get
ting to work and other committees will
investigate clairvoyance, mediumship,
etc. The attitude of these investigators
is supposed to be wholly interrogatory
and uninfluenced by assumption?, preju
dices or preconceived notions.
"Our plans are so incomplete and indefi
nite that I can't say much of what we
shall do," said J. Dalzeil Brown yester
day. "In a measure we are groping along
new lines. We believe tnÂ°re is truth tuere
and we want to find it. These are things
which everybody interested in life and
living should investigate. We will hold
the work of the society to strict lines aid
do our work quietly and seriously, avoid
ing public notoriety."
So at last San Francisco enters seriously
into the pursuit of the psychic mysteries
which have fed ignorant superstition since
the creation of man.

SEEKING
A NEW
MASK
The "Examiner's" Futile
Excuse for Its Convict-
Made Twine.
SAYS SOME ONE ELSE
BUYS PRISON BAGS.
J. D. Spreckels Directly Charged
With Encouraging a
State Industry.
HE WOULD NOT PATKONIZE
CALCUTTA.
Officers of the California Cottcn Mills
Declare That Spreckels Wanted
Them toMak; AM the Bags
The Examiner trie? to escape the re
sponsibility of establishing a twine fac- j
tory in San Quentin for its own personal j
U3e and benefit to the extent of 2 cents a
pound by crying out that John D. Spreck
els buys certain of the jute bags that are
manufactured ihere. The Examiner has
been unmasked and compelled to stand
out in the light that the workmen of Cali
fornia may s-ee it for what it is. The piti
ful spectacle it makes demands of it some
excuse, some place to hide.
Excuses or hiding-places are neither of
them at hand in this instance. In the |
ti.-st instance it whined that its purchases 1
did not constitute a big transaction and j
therefore suould be overlooked or con
doned by workingmen because of the
charities it had time to time bestowed.
When it read the expressions of disgust
and contempt that came from working
men ail over the Mateâ from men who
had hitherto believed the Examiner to be
fcneir friend as it Had claimed to be and;
uad waited to hear what explanation it
might make before they would accept j
The Call's revelation as true â it felt ih:it !
it mum at least rind something else to say.
And so, it btii'g impossible to deny the
fact that ii h<is sat up a twine factory in
San Quentin woriced by convicts, whereby
it mignt snve 2 cents a Dound, while twine
factories employing iree white labor are
in operation within telephoning distance
of its Mission-street fakery â not denying
this, it seeks to divert attention from its j
pitiiul position by crying that John D. I
Spreckels buys jute bags at San Quentin. j
Just what that has to ilo with the fact of
the Examiner's twine factory, it does not j
explain. It bays that it uas known this a
long time. Indeed? And why not? It
has always been a matter of common
knowledge. The affidavit required by the
law to be made and wliicfi was industri
ously avoided by the Examiner, was al
ways hied in Mr. bprecKe.'s' case. The
manufacture of jute bags has been under
stood to be carried on at San Quentin for I
years by a special exemption â the one
thing that was not likely to compete with
the free labor of the Stute. The factory
was established as a means of making the
institution self-supporting.
Why any act of John D. Spreckels or
any other business man should be offered
as an excuse by the Examiner for what
it may do is not clear, however. As a j
matter of fact Jar. Spreckels says he bnys f |
baps for certain Hawaiian plantations' j
giving the preference to California over i
the EiiÃlisn market.
Mr. Spreckels' business is Mr. Spreckels' j
buainess and no other's. It may be said
for him, however, that the order for jute \
bags left at San Quentin was in response to j
a special request Dy the board of directors
of that institution and even after the
California Cotton Mills bad declared its !
inability to furnish the bags at the price |
at which the market had been flooded |
here by foreign n.anufacturers.
The bag furnished at Sar. Quentin is a j
peculiar quality, whicn is used exclusively j
for export sugar manufactured at Hono
lulu. The California Cotton Mills, with
its free labor, manufactures every bag that
is used by Spreckels in the home market, |
find they number millions. The rough i
"pocket" bags used in Honolulu were for- i
merly manufactured in Calcutta, and in |
giving ttie order to San Quentin, keeping i
the money in the S..mp and enabling that
institution to become sen-supporting, both j
the San Quentin directors and the Cali* j
forma Cotton-mills Company give Mr.
Spreckels credit tor doing a patriotic and
â¢worthy thing.
The statements of Mr. Spreckels and of
ofheers of the cotton mills bearing out
these statements follow.
"Tfce baga we purchase at San Quentin,"
eaid Mr. SprecKels, "are purchased for
various plantations in Hawaii for which
we are agents.
"Our purchase of sugar-bags is not a
question of competition between local
manufacturers, but between this State
and England.
"The Prison Directors came to us some
time ago and asked us to get our bags
from them rather than from India, and in
this way save ihe State just that much.
We thought it a patriotic policy to do so
and consented. None of the bags pur
chased at San Quentin. however, lave
been used in the sugar business here. The
sugar from our refinery goes into bags
nuide by free California labor. The bags
made at San Quentin go to Honolulu.
They are heavy grain bags, weighing six
teen ounces.
"The ordinary grain bag weighs twelve
ounces, but these, on account of the pur
pose for which they are used, are made
extra heavy. Even when they are or
dered from Calcutta they have to be spe
cially made.
"In Honolulu we also come into com
petition with bags manufactured in Eng
land and sent to Calcutta by English ves
sel?. We aim to compete with England,
that gets her jute from India, and yet to
get the freighting of the bags from here
to Honolulu. Thai gives employment to
our ships.
"Now, say, for instance, that the annual
expense of running some department of the
penitentiary was $10,000, and they made a
profit of that amount upon the bags we
bought from them every year, it would
pimply mean that much saved to the
State, would it not?
"We used every effort to get the local
manufacturers to compete and furnish us
with bags at the same rate we could get
them from Calcutta, but they declared it
was impossible. So there was no alterna
tiveâit was Calcutta or San Quentin, and
we decided, for the reasons stated, in favor
. of San Quentin. I wish to repeat, bow
ever," said Mr. Spreckels, "that every bag
for sugar used by us in this country is
made by free labor and in California."
â¢ OAKLAND, Cal., March 14.â Reports
were circulated to-day by emissaries of
the Examiner that John D. Spreckel- &
Bros, were larger i urchasers of San Quen

quently greater enemies of free labor.
bureckels, it was stated, purchased largely
of the mill in the matter of sugar-bags
that he might have purciassd at free
labor mills. These reports were repeated
by a Call reporter to the officers of the
California Cotton Mills and they were
somewnat amused.
They said they were perfectly aware
that Mr. Spreckels was purchasing some
sugar-buss from San Quentin and said it
was a pood thine that tie was as it kept
the money in the State that would other
wise have gone to Calcutta When
Mr. Spreckels was making inquiry into
the sugar-bag market he consulted the
cotton mills and was informed that they
could not mike them so cheaply as the
imported goods from Calcutta, with
which the market was flooded. This be
ing so, it was better to keep the money in
the State by patronizing San Quentin
instead of East Indian coolies.
The bags bougnt by the Spreckelses at
San Qientin are not used in totfl country.
They are a coarse bag, known as l 'P> ck
ets," and are shipped to Honolulu. For
a long time Spreckels used inijorted bags,
which came to San Francisco and which
were never out of bond, and consequently
no duty was paid on them. They were
merely in transit to Honolulu. All the
fugar ba^s â and they amount to millions
annually â u?eu by Spreckels in California
are made in free-labor mills, and the re
sult is that hundreds of peop c are em
ployed in San Francisco and Oakland in
their manufacture.
Secretary G. K. Miller, when (o!d of the
re â¢ "rts said: "We were consulted at the
: .uu the Spreckeises gave ttieir order to San
Quentin ai.d we agreed that we could not
make the sugar baps at the price at which
tuev could be imported and laid down in
San Francisco from Calcutta. We believe
that Mr. Spreckels conferred a favor upon
the Siate of California when he ordered
his goods of Sun Quentin rattier than
from Calcutta. In this way he is helping
to support the Slate institution without
competing with free white labor. Mr.
Spreckels is a great patron of free-labor
jutemills.
"All of the poods that we manufactnre
anu he uses, he purchases of us. To our
mind, we could make ali of his sugar-baes
if we could furnish them at Calcutta
prices. Witt) Calcutta bags in bond at a
certain crice, no importer with any busi
ness sanse can be expected to pay higher
prices, or his competitors would soon
drive him out of business. We do not nor
never have made a solitary sugar-bag in
our mills that is used for importation.
AH of his beet-sugar bags for Alvarado
and the Western Refinery, San Francisco,
are made by us in the California Cotton
mills. We ship by carload lots to both
places, and often till orders amounting to
$5000 at a time. We consider that Mr.
Spreckels is in every way triendly to the
hundreds of people in our employ. I was

one of the middle men who handle our
goods. He never realized but that the
competition in the price of twine was
from free white labor until he read The
Call of last Wednesday morning."
William Rutherford, the superintendent
of trie East Oakland mills, laughed when
it was hinted that an effort was being
mado to have it appear thst John D.
Spreckels it Bros, were as much of a
menace to free labor as the Examiner.
"The Spreckels hrni are doing the State
a benefit by purchasing some sugar bau'S
at San Quentin," he said. "If they aid
not buy ihere they would have to use Cal
cutta bags and the money would then go
out of the country.
"We do not make any such bacrs and
could not >lo so at the price at which they
are imported from Calcutta. Consequent
ly, by all mean^ irive the work to San
Quentin and lessen its cost to the State.
"I am certain that if we could make
sugar-bags at Calcutta prices the Srjreck
elses would buy every one of us. We
make hundred* of thousands of bags ior
the firm and every pound ot beet su?ar
that is made in Una State and the sugar
refined at San Francisco is placed in our

which are sent directly to Honolulu.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1897.
BERKELEY IS TO
HAVE A PARK
Captain R. P. Thomas Will
Deed "La Loma" to
the Town.
His Acres, Relics and Quaint
Log Cabin to Be Berke
ley's Own.
Will Transfer the Property as Sorn
as the Town Is Able to Care
for It Properly.
BERKELEY, Cat-., March 14. â The
town of Berkeley will cc presented with
one of the most beautiful and pic
turesquely located park sites in the State
as soon as it is able to properly care for
the gift.
Captain R. P. Thomas, a soldier of 1861,
formerly president of the California Na
tional Bank of San Francisco, and present
owner of the Standard Soap Works, an
nounced to-day to a Call representative
that he intended to present to the town of
Berkeley, by deed of trust, his home site
of thirty-two acres at the north end of
the university town. The quaint and pic
turesque iog cabin built by his own hands
after seven years of labor, a portion of his
large collection of war relics and souve
nirs of many battle-fields, wnich are now
protected from the elements by an iron
bound building, will also go to the town.
It is his purpose to give all these things
to Berkeley as soon as the trustpes can af
ford to convert the property into a park
witti walks and drives and shrubbery and
to keep up its appearance.
The property is valued at about ? 25 ,000
and is adapted for a park, being now par
tially covered with eucalypti and trees oi
various other kinds, and command
ing as it does a most magnificent
view of the bay, and the cities.
From Â«he promontory on t.e slope of
the hill back of the main portion of the

property, on which Captain Thomas has
built up and equipped with broad-mouthed
howitzers a veriiable fortress, a pano
ramic view of the land -en pc below cun be
gained which is probably unsurpassed.
This point of vantage is reached by a
tortuous route from his dwelling, and
alone the pain of travel are frequent set
tees with canopies above. From the si le
of the hill, under a weeping-willow tree,
flows a perpetual stream of water.
Though somewhat difficult of access at
the present time from the center of town.
Captain Thomas is planning for a scenic
railway along Cednr street through his
grounds to Gr zzly Peak. Surveyors have
already mapped out the route of travel of
the proposed line, and as soon as the nec
essary franchises have been obtained the
road will be put through. It is proposed
further to build a iesort at the end of the
line which will conlorm somewhat to that
at the summit of Mount Tamalpais in
Marin County.
In speaking of the proposed gift to the
town and his railroad, Cup.am Thomas
said to-day:
"I want to give this property to the
town, if they find they can care lor it
properly and convert it, into a park for the
pleasure of its citizen? and v;siiors.
Throngs of people come over from San
Francisco every week, especially on Sun
day, for a .stroll through the university
grounds iiml over the hills, and I think
tnat Berkeley would be benefited
by a good park. I had thought somewhat
01 giving the property to the university,
but I have concluded that the town can
make more use of it, since I desire that
the place should nlways be kept intact.
"By the building of the suspension rail
road line which 1 have in mind the prop
erty will be made easy of access. Most of
the trees on :he place have been planted
by my own hand during the twenty years
of my residence here, and the love I have
gaineJ for the place would not permit me
to see it subJivuled nor put to any other
use than tor a public benetit.
"The little Jog cabin among the euca
lypti, in which 1 spend much of my time,
is a piece of my handiwork and is a result
of seven years' intermittent work. When
Icniuehere tnese thirty-two acres were
as barren as any plain you ever saw. Al
most any kind of trees and shrubbery c~u
be grown here. There are growing now
almost every kind of fruit-tree known to
California oichardists, not even excepting
the orange, the lemon and thp olive."
SABBATH-SCHOOL BENEFIT.

The benefit at the Tivoli Opera House
yesterday for the Bush-street Free Sab

The work that has been going on for
some time on the parade ground at the
Presidio, for the purpose of enlarging it,
is still in progress, and what there is in
evidence at this time gives a good idea of
what the grounds will look like when they
are leveled and brought up to the proper
grade. When completed it will be one of
the finest pieces of ground for the purpose
tnat can be found in the United State?.
The officers ana the men at the various
posts are all engaged at this time with
thoughts of the great military tourna
ment that is to be held at the PresHio in
April and in which competitors from all
the posts in the Department of California
will take pnrt. This event is one that
will be interestiiu-, not only to the sol
diers, but to the citizens, and it is believed
that there will be an unusually large at
tendance.
In the meantime the men are preparing
for the monthly field day, which is an
nounced for next Wednesday. One of the
events will be a shelter tent and equip
ment race, described in the schednle as
follows:
Two men armed with pistol, loaded with
blank cartridges, in each tent, pitched; blan
keis sp eaii under tliem; bats, blouses, leg
gings, spurs ana pistol off; saddle, bridle and
blanket (unfolded) outside; horsj held ten
yards away. At signal rise, put on clothing,
leggings and spurs; buckle on pistol ; strike
tent; rell blanket id shelter half, and strap on
cantie; fold saddle blanket; bridle and saddle
horse; mount, draw and tire blank cartiidge
irom pistol as sigual oi comoietion.
Another event that is on the list is
called the mounted skirmish contest, and
is describe ; as follows:
Troopers armed with carbine, revolver and
saber. EHCh trooper to take track, draw
tabar, right and lelt cut (alternately) against
infantry Â«t six heads on ground and returns
saber; draw pistol, fire s-ix shots (blank cart
ridges} to right and left front (alternately) at
heads on tnll posts; halt, throw horse and
magazine-fire five shots over horse, no shot to
be fired except horse is down. Five seconds
added to lime for every head missed. (Time
contest.)
In addition there will be a number of
events that will test the agility of the par
ticipants.
Tnat men may sometimes aspire to rise
from the ranks is manifest from an order
recently issued appointing a board of offi
cers to meet at the Presidio next
Wednesday to conduct the preliminary
examination of Sergeant-Major Robert
McCleave, First Infantry, an applicant for
a commission, wit it a view to determining i
bis eligibility for promotion to the grade
of second lieuienant. The board is com
posed of Captain Lewis Smith, Th.rd Ar
tillery; Gaptain Guy L. Edie, assistant
surgeon; First Lieutenant Louis P. .brant.
First Inlantry; First Lieutenant Paul F.
Straub, assistant surgeon ; Second Lieu
tenant Thomas G. Carson, Fourth Cavalry.
The following is the order that has been
received relative to the coast defenses:
No person*, except officers of the army and
navy of the United State?, anil persons in (he
service oi the United States employed in direct
connection with the use, construction or care
of these works, will be allowed to visit any
portion of the lake and coast defenses of the
United States, without the written authority
o i the commanding officer in charge.
Neither written nor pictorial descriptions of
these works will be made for publication with
out the authority of the Secretary of War, nor
will any information be given concerning
them which is not contained in the priuted
reports and documents ot the Wai- Depart
ment.
The commanding general of the army
has prepared a memorandum relating to
lycnums. The idea of the revision is that
these iyceums shali not be conducted in
the light of schools lo prepare officers for
promotion, simply for the purpose of ad
vancing a knowledge of tne military art
and acieuce.
ESCAPED FROM A
DEPUTY MARSHAL
Two Counterfeiters Created
a Scene on the Water
Front.
One of Them Got Away by Join"
ing in the Chase After
His Companion.
There was a scene of wild excitement at
the ferries yesterday morning. The
steamer bearing the Los Angeles passen
gers had just discharged tier human
freight and everybody was making for the
cars when there came a cry of "Stop those
prisoners!" At the same instant two men
broke through the crowd, and one taking
the east side and the other the west side of
East street, they ran for their lives in the
direction of Folsom street. In a few sec
onds there was a yelling mob in chase, i
but had it not been for thepres-nce of
mind of Harry Berges, watchman on
the Oceanic Steamship Company's wharf,
both prisoners would have escaped. He
tripped up one of the fleeing convicts nnd
pinioned him before he could rise. A few
minutes later the panting Deputy Marshal
came on the scene and again handcuffed
bis man. The other prisoner was no
where in sight.
Last Friaay Deputy United States Mar
shal W. J. Oaks left Los Angeles with
Frank Henning and John A. Clark
in hia charge. Both men had been
found guilty of counterfeiting and
were on their way to San Quentin
to serve a live years' sentence. The
prisoners were handcuffed together and
benaved themselves on the way here. It
appears, however, that Bauer could slip
his hand in and out of the cuff at pleas
ure, and he and Henning made all their
arrangements for a brealc for liberty as
soon as San Francisco was reached. While
walking out through the ferry building
the plan was carried out and the wild
rush followed.
Clark ran like a scared deer, but Hen
ning concealed the handcuff-* that dan
fried from his wrist in his pocket and
joined the pursuers. "There he goes!" he
yelled alone with the others, and when
his fellow prisoner had been captured he
quietly slipped away and has not been
seen since.

prisoner explained that he had played an
old trick on Deputy Marshal Oaks. When
the latter put the handcuffs on him he
had his hands clashed with bis thumb on
his wrist. When the thumb was with
drawn there was plenty of room in which
to more his hand in and out.
The Deputy Marshal took no further
chances with the man he had recaptured,
but at once started for San Quentin with
him. On his return he will remain here a
couple of days to see if he cannot recap
ture his other prisoner- Henning is well
known to the police here and it is thought
that bis liberty will be short-lived, more
especially as he still has tbe handcuffs
attached to his left wrist.
Henning and Clark were arrested in Lâ¢
Angeles last December for attempting to
manufacture and circulate counterfeit
coin. Clark had worked for a time in a
dental laboratory, and he conceived tbe
brilliant idea, it seem-, that he could
make counterfeit coins with the same
material â plaster of paris â that he used in
molding forms for the mouth. He took
Henning and a boy of 16, of good parent
j age, into partnership with. him. The
young leJlow was to "shove the queer" on
an unsuspecting public, but his very first
attempt resulted in his arrest. He i
peached on his associates and the officers
withheld bis name from the public. The
unit of Henning and Clark followed.
They were soon afterward indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury, tried in the
United States Circuit Court of Los An
geles, convicted and on March 4 wÂ»Â»re &en
tenced to live years each in San Quentin
piison. In Clark's den were fjund a
clumsy pair of plaster of paris molds for
I puking four-bit pheces and a quantity of
very crude coins. The y>air had apparently
come to on their lirst attempt to "do
business." Los Angeles knew of no pre
vious record of the pair in the line of
counterfeiting. Henning, the one who
escaped, is a native of Belgium, a butcer
by trade, aged about 38 year;., 5 feet 6% |
inches in height and weighs about 100
pounds, dark hair, gray eyes, dark com
plexion, of compact build, scar on left eye
brow and another on right arm above the
wrist.
