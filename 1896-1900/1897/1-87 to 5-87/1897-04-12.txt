DRIVING BACK
THE TURKS ON
THE FRONTIER
Greek Invaders of Macedonia
Occupy the Town
of Baltino*
BLOCKADE TROOPS IN BARRACKS.
Already the Loss Inflicted Upon the Moslem
Forces Is Serious, and the Army
of the Sultan Is Eager for
Open Warfare.
LARISSA, Greece, April 11.â The
Greeks who invaded Macedonia on Fri
day have occupied the town of Baltino,
despite the efforts of the Turkish troops
to check their advance. The garrison at
Baitino numbers 800 troops, all of whom
are now blockaded in the barracks.
Tbe insurgents have taken a number of
â prisoners, nine of whom have been Bent
to Kalambaka. Reports of the successes
of the insurgents have reached the ears of
the trooj p here and have creatly excited
them. They are eager for an ot>en dec
laration of hostilities and orders to ad
vance. Crown Prince Constantine and
other Greek commanders find difficulty in
checking the enthusiasm of the men.
ELAtrSONA, Macedonia., April 11.â Up
to this afternoon the precise detp.iis of the
fighting in the vicinity of Gravena have
not been received. Ed;. em Pasha, the
Turkish commander-in-chief, has sent an
officer to Gravena to ascertain all the
facts. It is undoubtedly due to the fact
that Edhem Pasha has nit yet received
positive information that Greek regular
troops were among the invaders that the
oru t for an advance of the Turkish army
lias not been given.
ATHENS, Greece, April 11.â The Gov
ernment has forbidden the circulation of
official reports of tbe incursion of Greeks
into Macedonia. It is said that every
effort was made to prevent the leaguers
from leaving Greece, but they evaded the
vigilance of the troops and got across the
frontier. Other insurgent bands are along
the frontier of Epirus, but detachments
of the regular GreeC army are keeping
them under surveillance to prevent them
from moving. Contradictory reports con
tinue to be received regarding the move
ments of the Greeks who crossed into
Macedonia and fought the Turks there.
One report says the lighting close to the
frontier hag entirely ceased, but that the
insurgent Greeks are battling in the in
terior of Macedonia. It is asserted they
gained material successes in the engage
ments along the frontier. The Greek loss
is stated to have been several killed and
wounded, while the loss inflicted upon
the Turks was far more serious.
The Italian volunteers under command
of Amilcar Cipriani, the well - known
Socialist agitator, are on the frontier,
where they nave adopted energetic action
against the Turks. They have blown up
with dynamite several Turkish outposts,
and it is said they have caused consider
able uneasiness among the Turkish lead
ers, who fear the success already achieved
will cause them to attempt the further
use of dynamite, which would demoralize
tne troops. The Government has mi

carbines of the most app.. , d pattern, have been tuorouguiy drilled and are considered excellent soldiers.
The San Francisco Call
i structed its agent at Constantinople to I
j deny that Greek regulars took part in the
i invasion of Macedonia.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 11. j
â The Porte has Sent a circular letter to
the Turkish representatives, declaring tne
force thai crossed the frontier Friday were
Greek regular troops. The letter adds
that the Greeks had artillery and directed
I the movements by a bugle corps, which
would not have been the case otherwise.
For these reasons the Porte contends that
Greece was the aggressor, and that Turkey,
i therefore, iseniiued to assume liberty of
action.
A circular issued by the Porte subse
! quent to the above says the Greek in
: vader3 were driven back and the status
: quo on the frontier has been restored.
WAR WILL FOLLOW.
Henry Norman Reviews the Creek
Situation, Which Could Not Ba
Much Worse.
LONDON, Kng., April 11.â A Lariasa
dispatch says the general opinion is that
war will be declared to-morrow or Tues
day. The Greek outposts are being quietly
strengthened. Pmall deiachments of
troopa are being sent forwaid utider cover
of darkness.
Henry Norman, special commissioner
of the London Chronicte, who is about to
retmrn from Athens, telegraphs he has
had farewell interviews with King George,
Prime Minister Delyannis and bkouzes,
Minister of Foreign Affairs. From their
conversation Norman regretfully draws
the deduction that the situation could i,ot
be much worse. The frontier incident, he
says, will probably be closed, but if it does
not set the frontier atiie it will only be
due to the discipline of the regular troops
t ami the severity of orders ttiat they re
main quiet.
Norrnau declares that Greece has loy
ally restrained the irregulars to the ut
most of her power. She repeatedly warned
Europe she could not cheek them defi
nitely. If the present act does not pre
cipitate matter? the next wiU. Despite
ihe fact that Turkey is defyins the treaty
of Berlin and fortifying Preveza at the en
trance to the Gulf of Arta, Greece has re
frained from exercising her undoubted
right to forcibly prevent the construction
of these fortifications.
Norman says a friendly power a few
days ago pressed King George to make a
proposal respecting Greece. The King re
piiec: ''Greece hat already made three
proposalsâ annexation, Bosnian regime
and piebi-cite â ai.d has no other to make.
If the powers reaily want pence they need
only stop trying to thrust upon Cretans a
regime they would die rather than accept
and allow them to decide tbeir own fate."
'lhe writer continues: "Prime Minister
Pelyannis' last words to me were: 'I have
but little hope. It appears toe diplomats
at Constantinople have gone no further
SAN FKANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, APRIL 12, 1897.
RIZA PASHA, the Turkish Minister of War.
Riza Pasha has been at the head of the War Office of Turkey for the past six years. He gained a reputation for bravery
and ability in the field during the wnr with Russia, and has been gradually advanced until he was given the direction of all
the military forces of the empire. There are seven army corps, in addition to the forces in Crete, which have their bead
quarters in Constantinople, Aarianople, Monastir. Etzeroum, Beyrut, Bagdad and Yemen. Each has from 35,000 to 40,000
men, drawn from the surrounding provinces, and is well supplied witto military stores and all necessary equipment.
than agreeing upon the principle of the
Cretan Assembly, and that the Cretans
shall elect their own Prince."
The Times prints these details of the
Gravena skirmish: A band of 1500, com
manded by Greek officers, crossed the
frontier near Balino, and advanced to
ward Gravena Friday. They encountered
the picket of tbe Fifteenth Chasseurs in
the woods and surrounded them. The
Sixth Battalion of Chasseurs, under com
mand of Islam Pasha, came to the rescue,
and two hours later drove the insurgents
to the frontier, killing 150. The number
of Turks killed is not known.
A.n Attack on the Turk*.
LARISSA, Greece. April ILâ It is ru
mored here that an attack has been made
on the Turks at the rear oi Mount Olym
pus, where the Greeks have succeeded in
planting a flag.
FACE TO FACE.
A Place Where the Turks and the
Greeks Confront One Another.
Frotn opposite sides of the straits of
Prevesa at the narrowest part the Turks
and the Greeks are closely watching each
other and the entrance to the Gulf of
Arta, which stretches away eastwardly
into the land for some twonty-hve miles,
and whose control means much to both
parties. At the extremity of the penin
sula, on which stands the old city of
Prevesa, and just outside its walls the
Turks have two strong fortresses â the
one with its principal face southwest to
ward the sea and the other facing directly
across the narrow channel. On the oppo
site side, a little over a mile away, on the
heights above tlie town of Aktion of an
cient fame, siand two Greek fortresses â
Fort Fanta anfl another of more recent
construction, having a mure direct com
mand of Preveso itself.
Both parties are ready for any move,
and a declaration of war or an> attempt
on the part of either to violate the stipu
lations of the treaty of Berlin and send
ships with military stores or war material
into the gulf will witness a critical test of
the strength of the works and the effi
ciency of those that man them. It is not
acre, however, that the clash may bi
looked for. Twenty miles away on the
Grecian side of the Arta River lies the
city of Arta, the Ambracia of the ancients.
Whatever may bo said of the uncer
tainty as to the exact location of the
frontier line between Thp^aaly and Upper
Macedonia and the difficulty of deter
mining when one party is trespassing on
the territory of the other, and the conse
quent room afforded for explanations and
disavowal of overt acts of invasion, does
not apply here. Juat south oÂ» the moun
tain pas? of Metrovo, a few miles to the
northeast of Janina, the frontier line
strikes the head of the river Artn, and,
following the middle of that stream down
to the gulf, cuts olf the port of Epirus be
tween the Arta and tbe crest of the Pindus
Mountain range, running nearly parallel
with the river, ar. d gives it to the Greek*.
Oo the east side of the liver are to be
found Greeks under Greek rule, contented
and happy Ujat after centuries of waiting
I a beneficent Providence has answered
their prayers for release from Moslem
rule. On the west side, and within fifty
miles of Christian Italy, the people, as a
whole, are at.il! Greekâ Greek in religion,
Greek in language and Greek In the sacred
memories of the past and blessed hopes of
the future. But. in spite of tbe blood so
freely poured out by Bozzaris and other
lovers of Christian liberty, they are, by
the dictate of the devil or his late agents,
tie diplomats of the Berlin Conference of
1878, separated from their brothers over
the river, and still kept under the rule of
the Turk. A start is all that is needed to
I set them into an open flame. Turkish
! troops are always kept among them in
force, but these are now engaged in watch
ing the Greeks.
At the City of Arta a stone bridge of a
single arch spans the river.
At the opposite ends of this bridge,
but a few rods apart, witti cannon trained
and guns ready, the Turks and the Greeks
are awaiting the signal for attack and
closely icrutinizeall who come and go. A
state of war, except actual fighting, al
ready prevails. Not only, here, but at
many other points, the river frontier is
readily crossed. Greeks going over rind
themselves among frnÂ«nds. The Turks
nre literally in an enemy's country under
an armistice which may be broken at any
moment. Should the Greeks be able to
force a pasrnge and hold their own in
j Epirus by seizing the roads leading north
j ironi Preveea they will effectually cut off
the Turkish garrison there from all com
munication with Janina and other towns
to the north, and with their navy would
soon make the reduction of the city a
matter of a short time.
SHOCKING FATE OF
A STRANGE WOMAN
Murdered and Decapitated
While Walking in
the Woods.
Her Head Found 200 Yards From
the Body, Which Had Been
Stripped of Flesh.
A Wcod-Cuiter Who Disappeared
About the Same Time as tbe
Victim, Is Supected.
MOUNT VERNON, 111., April 11.â
Boys passing through the woodland on
the Volney Osborne farm, five miles north
west of this city, yesterday, found a
woman's head lying near the public road
leading to Richview. They reported the
discovery. A searching party was organ
ized. They found the body 200 yards from
where the head lay, with the flesh stripped
from the bones, both the trunk and head
beine so badly decomposed as to render
recognition i m possible.
Deputy Ccroner Scatterfield to-dtfy held
an inquest. Tbe testimony showed the
body to be that of a woman who was in
the locality early in November. She was
apparently of middle ace, under medium
height, with Dlack hair. She s-tayed in
the neighborhood two or three days. She
refused to divulge her name, DUt said her
home was in Carmi, HI., m.d that she was
going afoot to St. Louis.
The last seen of her alive was while
walking along the road on which her body
was found. A man who passed her
shortly after she had entered the wood a
quarter of a mile farther on encountered
a woodcutter, to whom he mentioned the
woman's approach. The woodcutter said
he would take her along in his wagon.
They were never seen together, but the
theory is that another Pearl Bryan mur
der has been committed. It is said that
the man suspected of the crime left the
country shortly after the woman's disap
pearance.
DESCENDANTS OF SIR FRANCIS.
They Form an Association to Lay Claim
to the Drake d;ate in England
Worth Millions.
ALTOONA, Pa., April 11.â Two hun
dred descendants of Sir Francis DraKe,
the famous English navigator, have
formed an association in the western part
of Pennsylvania, to put forward a claim
to what was once nis estate. The prop
erty is situated in Devon and Somerset
counties, England, and consists of about
6000 acres and over $200,000,000 cash accu
mulation of rentals for about 150 years.
They say the famous sailor lent property
to his two sons, John and Francis. In
1749 the hoirs of Francis Drake became
extinct and the estate reverted to the
heirs of John. The members of the asso
ciation claim to be direct descendants of
John.

CUBANS CRUSH
THEIR SPANISH
ADVERSARIES
An Overwhelming Defeat of
Forces Under Zamora *
in Matanzas.
VICTORIES FOR THE PATRIOTS.
Weyler Greatly Worried Over the Fate of
the Garrison at the Fort at Seborucal,
Which Was Bombarded With
Dynamite Shells.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 11. â News comes
from Matanzas of a bis: battle fought yes
terday near the estate Andes, a few miles
from El Coliseo. Tha Spanish official re
port published here claims one of the
greatest victories obtained by the Span
iards since the war began.
From other sources, however, it is
known the tight ended in the total defeat
of the Spanish column led by Colonel
Zamora, with Captain Andrade in com
mand of the cavalry force?. The news
proves the strength of the revolution in
Matanzas province, where, according to
the last official communications, only a
few scattering insurgent bands remained.
The Spanish confess the loss of thirty
four killed and tifty-one wounded, Dul, as
in all similar cases, the casualties were
only among the regular soldiers of the
battalion, and the killed and wounded of
the guerilla forces, which, according to the
Spanish plan, always march in front of
each column, are not mentioned. The
Cuban general, Betancourt, reports that
Zamora lost 120 men in the engagement.
The battie began after the Spaniards
had completed the destruction of the
plantation at Andes, under the instruc
tions of General Molina, commander of
the Spanish forces in the province, who
received news that the insurgent! wera
taking provisions from that estate. He
sent Zamora with 2500 men to reduce the
whole prop2tty to ashes. After that work
was completed, when Zamora was leaving
the place, his vanguard was suddenly at
tacked by the Cuban cavalry.
The engagement lasted five hours, and
the Spanish column was compelled to re
tire to El ColiÂ»eo, which Zamora entered
about 6 o'clock in the evening, with the
soldiers panic-stricken and man/ missing.
Of the cavalry of Captain Andrade only a
few men remained.
In Pinar del Rio the war is being carried
on with great enthusiasm by the insur
gents. An engagement is reported at San
Francisco and Recompensa between the
Spanish forces of Veraga and the Cubans,
led by Bermudez, in which both sides had
heavy losses.
Weyler is reported to be greatly con
cerned over the fate of the garrison of the
principal Spanish fort at Seborucal, near
Placetas. The fort was attacked Friday
by a large force of insurgents who bom
barded it with dynamite shells from a
pneumatic cannon. The fort was utterly
destroyed, half the garrison being killed,
and the other half, excepting four men,
captured. Those who escaped fled to
Placetas.
General Weyler and staff arrived at
Placetas yesterday from Sancti Spiritus,
after having made an inspection at the
Jucaro-Moron trocha.
FITZ AND JIM FOOLED.
They Were Induced to Pocket a
Very Small Share of ths
Picture Privilege.
Statements That Caused ths Pugilists
to Take a Moderate Part of
the Proceeds.
BOSTON. Maps., April 11.â According
to a letter received by Editor George V.
Tuohey of the Spotting Review yesterday
from a man close to Enoch the report that
the Rector pictures of the Carson fight
are a failure was sent out to help kill the
bills prohibiting the exhibition of the
pictures now before several Legislatures.
Charley Mulien, who assisted Rector in
makins the picture?, is quoted by Tuohey
as stating In an interview that tbey were
perfect in every respect. Tuohey's cor
respondent further says:
"It will surprise the average person to
learn that Corbett and Fitz-<immons eacli
received $3666 66, or one-third oi $11,000,
the fgure supposed to have been paid by
Rector to Stuart for the control of the
pictures.
"This is how it was done: Fitzgimmons
raised a rumpu* over the money and
tin uly changed the articles of agreement
so tnat he and Co:b::U were given a tl.ur i
interest, and it was agreed that the com
bination should wort on a royalty, with
Stuart as a third party.
"A few days later the machines were
seized in New York, ana to the uniniti
ated it looked as though tnÂ«y could not be
forwarded to Carson in time for the fight.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
This friehtened Fitzsimmons and Corbett
into accepting Stuart's statement, thÂ«t
Rector was willing to pay $11,000 and take
bis chances.
"After considerable bickering Stusrt told
Fitzsimmons and Corbett that there was
danger of the pictures beint; spoiled De
cause of the rarefied condition of the ar.
Th:s proved a settler, and the men signed
on the terms made by Stuart. Edison was
willing to pay at least $250,000 for the
picture privilege. Thus Stuart outsharped
the boxers and secured for $11,000 some
thing for which another concern was will
ing to pay $250,000. Wheelock, Rector
and Stuart form the combination tnat se
cured the privilÂ«ees."
ONE DEAD, THREE DYING.
Result of a Shooting Affray at
the Mining Camp of
Altman.
Serious Trouble Follows the Attempt
of a Drunken Miner to Sop
a Pool Game/
!
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., April 11.-A
serious shooting affray occurred this aft
ernoon at Altman, one of the mining
camps of this district, about five miles
southeast of the city, at the top of the
famous Bull Hill. The trouble occurred
during the progress ot a gsrae of pool, and
was started by a miner named John Cox,
who was intoxicated. Cox attempted to
stop the game, and was warned by the
other Dlayersâ Robert Dailey, Harry
Minor and Samuel Losherâ not to inter
fere.
Cox suddenly drew his gun and shot
Dailey in the chest, the latter dying in
stantly. Minor and Losher attempted to
disarm Cox, but he turned the weapon
upon them, wounding eacn in rapid suc
cession.
As Losher fell a shot from his revolver
inflicted a mortal wound upon Cox.
Losher's injuries are probably fatal, while
there Is no hope for the recovery of Minor.
The latter is tne superintendent of the
famous Victor mine, one of the largest
gold properties in the Cripple Creek dis
trict. He is a man of considerable orom
inence, while ail the men who participated
in the affair are well known at Altman.
The body of Dailey has been brought to
this city and the three dying men are at
the Miners' Union Hospital. This is the
most serious tragedy that ever occurred in
the camp, and has created great excite
ment.

SMALLPOX SCARE
AT HONOLULU
New Chinese Minister to
This Country Refused
a Landing. '
Gaelic Quarantined Because She
Comes From an Infected
Japanese Port.
Annexation Agitator to Bs Sent to
Washington âJapanese Immigra
tionâMilitary Dissensions*
Â«
HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 3-â At a
special meeting of the Board of Health
this morning, called to take action on the
arrival of the Oriental anil Occidental
steamship Gaelic, it was decided that no
exception could be made in the case of the
new Chinese Minister to the United
State?, who was on board and desired to
land with his retinne for a two days' stay
in this port. While tbe vessel herself had
a clean bill of health and there had been
no sickness or deaths on the passage, the
reports received, from Dr. Eidredge, the
Hawaiian Consul and sanitary inspector
at Yokohama, concerning the spread of
smallpox in the Japanese empire, were so
alarming that the board did not hesitate
a minute in arriving at a conclusion to
Btrictly enforce the existing quarantine
regulations. Dr. Eldredge reports 124
cases with 43 deaths in Yokohama alone
for the two weeks ending March 23. For
the ten days between March 13 and 23
there was a total of 3743 cases in the
Japanese empire, with 1100 deaths â a very
high percentage. In all aces but Yoko
hama the disease was steadily on the in
crease.
The Gaelic was allowed to coma up to
the wharf in quarantine and discharge
her freight for fumigation. No one is al
lowed to land from the vessel, even on
me wharf, and no one bat the quarantine
officials can go near her. The Chinese
community is much disappointed over
their failure to entertain their distin
tinguished visitor and have been loading ;
him down with fruits and flowers and
other presents to show their respect. The
Hawaiian Government would have ex
tended the Minister much courtesy had
he been allowed to land, bet under the
circumstances could only express their
regrets in a communication from the !
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
T.e Minister, whose full name is Ng
Choy V>"u Tine Fong, speaks fluent Enc
ash, having been educated in London,
â where he studied law. He afterward
practiced that profession successfully in
ihe courts of Hongkong, where he
eventually attracted the attention of Li
Hung Chang, afterward becoming bis
private secretary. In this capacity he
baa much to do with the Japanese treat
ies, and his present promotion is un
doubtedly cue to the influence of his pow
erful patron.
Since the Japanese steamers have been
running to this port, neither the Pacihc
Mail nor the Occidental and Oriental lines
have carried Â»ny Japanese immigrants or
freight to speak of. It is said that the
recent action of the Hawaiian Govern
ment in refusing a landing to over 600
immigrants brought in Japanese steamers
13 due to the receipt of information of the
methods adopted in obtaining and ship
ping them by the agents in Japan fur
nished by the rival lines, who felt the loss
of this lucrative branch of their trade
severely.
In view of the threatened complica
tions with Japan there is a very general
desire expressed that President McKinley
will send out a successor to Minister
Willis at once.
By way of Australia the news is re
ceived that H. M. S. Penguin will sail
from Sydney lor Honolulu some lime this
month to survey a route between these
two ports for cable purposes. It is s'gnifi
cant also that H. M. 8. Wild Swan, now
in this port, leaves in a lew days for Fun
ning* Island to maÂ«e surveys ior the same
purpose. It may be mentioned that Col
onel Spalding'i franchise from ttie Ha
waiian Government for a Pacific cable
line expires next month.
There is much speculation concerning
the real object of the appointment of W.
A. Kinney tn> special commissioner of the
Hawaiian Government tn Washington
and various surmises are indulged in here.
Yoor correspondent i as it on good au
tnority that he is to go for the purpose of
influencing those of the silver Senators
who are hostile to annexation. Mr. Kin-
i:ey 15 and has been a pronounced advo
cate of free silver. He formerly lived at
Salt Lake and is personally acquainted
â¢with most of the silver leaders at Wash
ington, esDecially those in Congress. It
is the understanding here that the silver
men hold the balance of power in the
United State Senate and the intimation
from t..e Hawaiian representatives at
Washington that the presence of a man of
their own party to work on the sympa
thies of tbe silver Senators would be ad
visable was quickly acted on. This is the
secret of tbe new appointment.
New? comes from Hawaii this morning
of a terrible accident in the mountains be
tween Kukuihaele and Wafmea last Sat
urday, when two heavy wagons loaded
with the paraphernalia of the Montagu-
Faust Circus Company went over a cliff
into the deep gulch bslow, resulting in
the death of one driver, the serious injury
of the other and the killing of two horses.

FEARFUL DISASTER ON THE RAIL.
CHARLOTTE, N. C. April n.â Two passenger trains on the
Southern Railway collided at Harrisburg this morning. Three men
were killed and five seriously injured. No. 36, the fast mail north
bound, had the right of way, and No. 11, the southbound local from
Richmond, had orders to sidetrack at Harrisburg. After leaving Con
cord, however, No. 11 lost time, and at 11:15 was forty seconds distant
from the switch that opened into the sidetrack. Only a space of 100
yards lay between the local and safety. At this point the fast mail
dashed around a curve, crashing into it. The engines and mailcars
were completely demolished. Postal Clerk Benton was imprisoned in
the wreck with an engine above him. Cold water was dashed on him
from the outside to counteract the effect of the scalding steam. He
begged the rescuers to kill him, and lived only a few minutes. Fetus
Eudy and Will Donaldson, firemen, were killed. Engineer Kinney of
Thomasville, N. C. , was fatally injured. The dead and injured were
brought to Charlotte on a special. Among the passengers on the ex
press were Senator Money of Mississippi and General Sanguilly.
arcone the volunteer regiment of National
Hawaiian GuarJs a s\a;e of dissatisfaction
with the Government, resulting In dimin
ished attendance on drills and occasional
resignations of officers. This ill feeling
hart a fresh development yesierdav, when
: a committee of n:ne leading officers, in
cluding tbe colonel, preserved themselves
i by appointment at 2 p. m. at Minister
i Cooper's office to conler with the Execu
tive. It seems that Mr. Cooper had sent
Colonel Fisher a notice, whica was not de
', llvered, that the meeting would be post
'â  poneJ to the sth. After waiting niteen
minutes in the outer office, where they
were distinctly visible through the open
door, the officers sent word to the Minis
j ter that they had come. Instead of coming
, out to make an explanation, he sent ttjeia
; what they consicieied a curt and discourt
eous message that they were to come
on Monday. The officers took this in
dudgeon and left, saying that they should
not try to have the conference with the
i President and Cabinet, as they would not
i be inconvenienced to come again. Cooper
â  then sent tor them to come back, which
they refused to do.
The chief complaints in the regiment
are that the Government does not care to
incur very necessary expenses for the well
beine of tbe regiment, and also that aliens
' are too often given public employment.
Instead of volunteers who have borne
arms in defense of the Government for
four years at great inconvenience to them
selves.
It seems somewhat doubtful whether
, tbe Government will be abie to keep the
i service? of that boay of well-disciplined
1 troops, who are its main defense, -unless
Minister Cooper resigns. Taere are -fifty
, enlisted men on regular duty, but these
i hired aoldien are far inferior material to
! the 3-30 volunteer citizens.
DISTRIBUTION OF PATRONAGE.
ft Is Hh spend That There Is Lkely to
Be a Row Between Ferkma
and Loud.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April ILâCol
ocei George A. Knight of San Francisco
has returned to Washington and is at
W -.Hard's. He protests that he wants
nothing for himself, and his closest
friends believe this. He says he is here
in the interest of a friena's appointment,
bet this is taken with a few grains of salt.
Some of his intimates know that he is
watchine the United Slates Jud-eship.
He is bound that De Haven shall not be
appointed if he can he help it.
Judge Waymire is here yet, and it is the
impression that he will succeed Morrow,
who will be elevated to the United States
Circuit bench. ,T. F. Evans of San Fran
cisco, who is here, claims to have inside
information that Hon. M. M. Estee will
be appointed District Judge, tut Mr. Es
tee's hard political luck lorrueriy does not
inspire much confidence in the California
delegation that he will meet with any suc
cess at this time.
It is whispered in the California colony
here that there is likely to be a pretty row
in the near future between Senator Per
kins and Representative Loud of San
Francisco over the distribution of tbe
loaves and fishes. Mr. Loud, it is said, is
inclined to believe that Senator Perkins is
getting more than his share. It is said
that he will not only insist upon the ap
pointment of a Postmaster at Sail Fran
cisco, but of tbe United States Marshal
and perhaps one other officer, besides the
smaller poÃtofficeÂ» in his district as they
become vacant.
Neither Senator Perkins nor Mr. Loud
wiil discuss the possibility of any dis
agreement between them.
It is believed here that if Colonel Har- '
j rmon Gray Otis will continue to preserve
a dignified and friendly altitude toward '
the administration, he will sooner or later '
| be offered an appointment which woula
not necessitate an absence from the
j United States. President ilcKinley is
said to be fuily aware of the valuable ser
i vices which Colonel Otis performed for
him before the St. Louis convention and
afterward.
Joe Spear of Ban Francisco has started
on his way home rejoicing over the pros
pectânow an assuranceâ 'hat he will be
j appointed to till the shoes of W. D. Eng
â¢ lish, as burveyor ot the Port.

Tbe armor will hereafter be shipped in lots

The Russian officers give no reason for

sufficiently severe. These are the same,
however, as the United States requires
and severer than those of any other Gov

MOVEMEST3 OF TROOPS.
The heavy cost to the army fund in
transporting troops to the inauguration
and the additional drain imposed ov the
presence of even a larger force at the
Grant Monument ceremonies will prevent
any extended movement of troops this
spring. Four troops of cavalry have lately
been transferred in the Weit, two of which
are stationed at Yellowstone Park. Aside
from these tiiere will be little chance, if
any, o! other regimental changes until
autumn or perhaps another year. All
the infantry regiments in the West will
probably remain at their present stations.
BANKING AND CCR&ENCY.
Members of Congress have received
copies of the draft of a joint resolution
authorizing the appointment of a commis
sion to investigate the banking and cur
rency question, prepared by a committee
of the in iianapolis monetary convention.
This committee haÂ« been in Washington
fora fortnight, consulting with members
of the administration and Congress as to
the best method of accomplishing the
purpose. The resolution authorizes the
President to appoint a commission to con
sist of eleven persons whose duty shall be
to at once enter upon a comprehensive
consideration of the currency and bank
ing system. The commission is to report
a bill before November.
The proD.ibi.iUes for a consideration of
this proposition at this session of Con
gress, at best, are remote. There is no ob
jection to it, and it is even admitted to be
a good thing, but the opportunities it
would offer the fcenate for a debat- of the
money question, that might even side
track the tariff, are deemed by Ding
ley and other Honse leaders too great a
risk.
The composition of the commission re
vives tbe controversy which raged at toe
Indianapolis convention over the ques
tion, "Should Congress take part in the
inquiry?" A member of Congress said
yesterday:
"If the friends of the movement want to
succeed, it would bo better to make the
commission consist of three Senator*,
three Representatives and five business
men. Tnen, whatever proposition is
recommended will have friends at court."
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION.
It is reported that T. V. Powderly, ex
grand master of the Knights of Labor,
will be appointed Commissioner of Immi
gration. Powderly is indorsed by many
of the leaving labor organizations of the
country, aside from having the support
of Senators Quay and Penrose and many
members of the Concessional delegation
from the Keystone State.
VIKIT Or SIAM'S KINS.
The State Department is waiting to hear
something official about the visit of the
King of fciain in September, so Congress
can be asked to make an appropriation to
cover the expense ol entertaining
him. The department knows nothing
about the contemplated tour of his
Majesty beyond what has been printed,
but it has taken time by the forelock and
looked up the records to find wbat was
done when other sovereigns visited tais
country. In 1884 the department asked
Congress to make an appropriation for
the entertainment of the Siamese emÂ»
bassy charged with a special mission to
the Government. Congress did not make
an appropriation and the embassy never
came.
ENORMOUS LOSS BY THE FLOODS.

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 11.â The
Department of Agriculture has just issued
a special bulletin showing the condition

A slow fall in the rivers of the hit. LouU

the future ti.ere depends on storm condi

along the Mississippi In that district, but
no danger is apprehended from the water
now in sight. At Memphis the river Is
etstionary. In the northern part of the
Yazoo delta the situation is a little more
hopeful, but it is becoming hourly more
perilous in the White River Valley. At
New Orleans the river has passed the
highest known watermark by the tenth of
a foot, but the levees are holding. The
Ohio from Cincinnati to Cairo has risen
rapidly. The MPsissiDpi has fallen from
St. Paul to Keokuk and Has risen from St.
Louis to its mouth. Light showers have
fallen in the flooded districts.
A POLITICAL SOMERSAULT.
Finding of a Gold Mine in Mexico Has a
Convincing Effect on a Forrmr
Pcpu/ist Leader.
BRUNSWICK, Ga., April ILâ Captain
H. W. Reed, Tom Watson's right hand
man during the Presidential campaign, is
now an advocate of gold, bavine gone ex
tensively into the mining of that metal in
Mexico. Reed was president of the
National bank here. He went as a dele
gate to tha St. Louis convention, where he
waa placed upon tha National committee.
From that position he wa3 chosen a mem
ber of the standing committee of three,
nea:e 1 by Washburn, to arrange an
entente between Watson and Bryan. Reed
thus became Watson's mouthpiece, and
resisted all efforts at fusion upon the
electoral ticket. After the election he
went on atrip to Mexico, whence he has
now returned. He says:
"I have found in Mexico ore which runs
to the fabulocs value of forty-five ounces
to the ton, or $900. Labor there is only 62
cents a day, Mexican money. This gives
a caving of $2 50 a day on that score over
mining in the States. Timber is cheap
and water abundant. I intend to return
to Mexico next month to develop my gold
mines."
Reed's Populist friends here areangered
over the prominent chief's desertion, but
Reed says he won't shut bis eyes to facts.

| House Staniing Committee Vacancies
to Be Filled When the Tariff |i
Disposed Of.
WASHINGTON, D. GL, April 11.â Be>
j yond the consideration of lbs three gen
j eral appropriation billsâ the agricultural,
Indian and sundry civil â there appears to
â  be no definite programme in the Senate
for the week. Even these may not ba
discussed, as Chairman Allison of the
: Appropriations Committee rinds all his
'â  time occuDied with the sub-committee on
: the tariff MIL While the appropriations
i carried by these bills, which failed to be-
I come laws last Congress because of Cleve
i land's refusal to sign them, will not be
â¢ necessary until the beginning of the next
â¢â  fiscal year, yet the Republlctn leaders are
j anxious to get them out of the way before
j the tariff bill is taken up. They should
; occasion very little debate, however, be
! ing practically in the same shape as
' passed last session.
The bankruptcy bill remains unfinished
j business, and debate on this measure will
; fill any time after the morning hour each
day that may hang heavily on the Senate.
It will not be considered very seriously,
! hbwever, as there is a general disposition
' on both sides of the chamber to suspend
â  action upon almost everything except ap
: propriation bills until the vacancies in
committees are ft. led.
The Republican steering committee is
( greatly encouraged with the progress
I made in this work, and claim that their
I plan of making up the committees will
j succeed, notwithstanding the efforts to
{ combine the Democrats, the free-silver
j Republicans and Populists in opposition.
The general treaty of arbitration with
J Great Britain may be taken up again at
any time, thocgn its friends are not over
! confident of its passage and may, if they
cannot command the necessary two-thirds
' majority, allow it todis the most peaceful
i death possible. It has remained in a
comatose condition all the week, owing to
the absence of several Senators who are
| opposed to the convention, and great d ffi
i culty is experienced in arranging their
pairs, it being necessary to pair each Sen
ator in the negative against two in favor.
Until this tangle is Etraightened out there
will be no vote on the treaty. The instru
! ruent has passed toe amendment stage,
I and any speeches yet to follow must be
directly upon the treaty itself.
Tharston of Nebraska, according to pre
vious notice, will on Tuesday continue his
remarks on the foreclosure of the mort
gage against the Union Pacific
There is not apt to be any chance this
weeJt in the present programme of the
Republican majority of ihe House, which
is to meet on Wednesday and Saturday
only and adjourn without transacting
any business. It was thought that Secre
tary Long's communication on Saturday
regarding his inability to procure armor
for the new battle-ships, as the price
fixed by law mi^ht induce tue managers
to deviate from their announced policy so
far as to permit tiie House to do some*
thing to relieve the Secretary's embarrass
ment, bat as the iedu.ct.ion in the price of
armor from $400 to $300 per ton was an
original Senate proposition tha House
will probably await the action of that body
in the matter. Lens will send a copy of
his recommendation to the Senate to
morrow Shomd the Senate before the
end of the week dispose of any of the
three great appropriation bills now on
the calendar the House will promptly
send them to the President, as what few
amendments have been made by the San
ate committee are unimportant.
A broad intimation was given to-day
that Speaker Re<d would not wait until
Congress reassembles in December to
name the standing committees of ihe
House, but that as soon as the tariff bill
was out of the way they would be an
nounced. With this wag coupled the
statement that some matters might then
be considered before the extra session,

Ju-t as these arrangements to elect a

from Louisville on an express train, and
rushing to the place of conference he per
suaded his friends to rescind their action
and continue the war on Hunter. This
they have done persistently since, and
Hunter's election is more doubtful thaa

The Robber's Crime Punishable With
Death According to the Law
of the Rand.
BANDSBUBG, Cal., April 11.â William
fl. Hevrin, manager of the Great San
Juaquin Supply Company's interests bere,
was confronted in his office at 3 o'clock
this morning by a masked robber and
forced to deliver over the contents of the
cash- drawer, amounting to $200. The out
law escaped with his booty.
Hevren had counted :he cash prepara
tory to closing for the balance of the
night, but after placing it ia the safe be
remembered that the change for the sa
loon part of the business was not left in
the register. He took out thbcash-drawer
and walked to the register. Just then the
masked man wanted in, exclaiming:
"Throw up your hands."
Hevren and Frank Ham, the only other
person in the place, at once obeyed. The
robber kept his revolver moving from one
to the other as he edged toward the safe.
He took Hevreu's pistol from it, and,
alter placing it in his pocket, said:
"I want your money."
"All right; here it is," said Hovren. "I
just took it out of the safe; it is yours."
Hevren shoved the drawer toward the
robber, who transferred his revolver to his
left hand and with the right took the
money out of the drawer and put it into
bis pocket. Hevren asked him to leave a
little "chicken feed" to open up on.
About this time the robber became nerv
ous and did drop several coins. Backing
out and cosing the door slowly, he warned
them not to follow or he would kill them.
The safe was wide open, with several
packages of money and jewelry in full
Tiew. One -ack, belonging to Willy Ken
yon, contained $600, and a diamond ring
worth $400 was in another purse, but the
bandit did not molest these packages.
The robber was of medium height and
wore a drab duster. His mask was made
of dark cloth, with white-painted circles
around the eyeholes. The fellow was
tracked to Johannesburg, but there the
trail was lost.
This was the first genuine hold-up ever
attempted in this district and it has cre
mated much uneasiness. According to the
unwritten law of the Rand, a robbery of
this character is as serious a crime as a
cold-blooded murder, and the perpatrator
is responsible with his life to tne vigilance
committee which has been formed by the
miners.
SAN Joi>E FAMILY POISONED.
Barefy Saved From Death After Partak

Mushrooms.
SAN JOSE, Cax., April 11. â Several
members of the family and quests of Al
fred Pozzo, who resides at 80 North River

l'czzo shoved symptoms of poisoning a
few moments later, and then Miss Dollie
Dohrmann, Erban Espinoza and Manuel
Castro became affected.
A physician was summoned, and, after
making a diagnosis of the cases, said the
family had b'iea poisoned by the mush
room* they had eaten. Another doctor
was sent for to assist in relieving the vic
tims, and after two ana a half hours' con
tinued labor with emetics and antidotes
the physicians pronounced the family out
of danger. Mr. and MrÂ«. Pozzo also ate
lightly of the mushrooms, but were not
affected.

OREGON SHEEP STARVING.
Owners Refused Grazing Privileges on the
Verdant Ranges in Wash
ing ton.
PORTLAND, Or., April 11.â E. A. Buck
ley, a sheep-raider of Sherman County,
has been told to keep off the grass by the
County Commissioner of Klickitat County,
Wash. This injunction will, of necessity,
be heeded, but it will greatly injure the
sheep-raising industry of Northeastern
Oregon. Euckley represents many sheep
men who have heretofore been allowed ac
cess to rich ranges in Klickitat County
and the Mount Adams region, across the
Columbia.
It seems that the cattle and sheep men
on the Columbia side want the ranges for
themselve and procured the passage of a
law by the Washington Legislature, which
gives County Commissioners of the border
counties the right to say whether sheep
may come across.
Mr. Buckley, one of the most extensive
wool-growers in Oregon, and another
sheep man, were plainly told by tne
Klickitat Commissioners that no permits
would be issued. In consequence there is
no summer range in sight for over 100,000
sheep which should be taken to ranges at
once, as the hard winter has used up the
available feed supply. Some of the sheep
may be sold, but it Is feared many bands
will die, as the Oregon ranges are utilized
by sheep from other counties.
The Klickitat Commissioners say the
tax heretofore coliected on migratory cat
tie has added something to the county's
revenue, but does not amount to what
regular taxes collected from resident
sheepmen would. They accordingly want
to keep their ranges and siimaiaie the
cattie and sheep industry at home.
EXPORTS FROM SEATTLE.
Heavy Canoes Carried Westward on the

SEATTLE. Wash.. April 11.â The Great
Northern Nippon Yusen Kalsha's steam
ship Bakura Maru has cleared ana will
early to-morrow morning nail for the
Orient with a cargo of about 3000 tons,
valued at $160,500. Its manifest discloses
principally cotton, lubricating oil, paper
mill machinery and flour, consigned to
the ports of Hongkong, Kobe and Yoko
hama.
The Saltura Maru left behind on the
wharves awaiting shipment nearly twice
as much carco as it took. To a greater or
less extent this has been the case since the
arrival in this port, about nine months
ago. of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's maiden
ship, the Miike Maru. Of rawcottcn alone
there awaits the arrival of the next vessel,
the Tenshin Maru, over 2000 baies. For
the week ending witn the clearance of the
Sakura the loral custom-house receipts
amounted to $3750.
Coming this way tbe Nippon Yosen
Kai-lia's steamers have not been so heavily
laden. The^ir cargoes range from about 100
tons, broueht by the first, to 1500 tons by
later vessels. It consistf-d mainly of teas,
silks, rice, matting and Japanese curios.

Witness an Ineffectual Attempt to Dock
the Oregon.
SEATTLE, Wash., April liâ An inef
fectual attempt to dock the battleship
Oregon in the Government drydock at
Port Orchard, that it might undergo
needed alterations and repairs, was made
at noon to-day. Two thousand excursion
ists, lured' thither from Seattle, Tacoma
and Port Townsend to witness the dock
ing, were sorely disappointed. After the
vessel had -teamed up to the mouth of
the docks the commandant decided that a
more favorable condition of the tide could
be obtained, so he announced a postpone
ment of the affair until about 1 o clock to
morrow morning. The noon tide was not
considered high enough by three inches to
guarantee perfect safety. â â. â . .. ' . .. '

BULL-FIGHTS AT YUM A.
James Meadows, a Matador, Gored br an
Enraged Animal He Was
Baiting.
YUM A, Ariz., April ILâ Yuma's five
day fiesta closed to- iay. The Plaza de
Tores was the scene of two more Spanish
bull-fights, and Matador James Meadows,
a brother of "Arizona Charlie" Meadows,
the owner and manager of the Wi!d West
show, was seriously wounded. He is tbe
second man gored during tbe week.
A magnificent black bull named Por
firio Diaz, in honor of Mexico's President,
was turned into the arena and made
straight for Meadows, who moved the au
dience to applause by stepping to one side
an i then vaulting upon the back of the
animal. But the applause died out in an
expression of horror, for the next mo
ment he was upon tbe ground under the
bull's feet and the animal's horns were in
his body. Only the quick work of the
picadors saved his life.
There was no other matador in the
troupe and the fight was ended by lassoing
the bull and throwing him and placing
bags containing corn upon his horas,
whence the picadors took the sacks.

RIIZVILLE. Wash., April ILâCon

day. "Wline he was attempting to drive
from his freight train a number of tramps
nho were stealing a ride on the brake
beams one of the hobos drew a revolver
and from a distnnce of only about ten feet
fired at him. Fortunately the tramp's
aim was bad, and the bullet whistled by
the conductor's head. Doane stood his
ground, although his train crew sought
the shelter of the cars. In a minute or so
tbe train had pulled up until the caboose
was abreast of Doane and he got aboard.
After he had done so the tiamp tired four

STOCKTON, Cal., April 11.â The base
ball season opened iieie to-day with one
of tbe largest crowds in attendance that
has witnessed a baseball game in this city
in years. The contesting teams were the
Imperials of San Francisco and the Stock
ton nine. They jut up as good a game of
ball as any of the wildest baseball cranks
could wish for. The great feature was the
pitching of George Harper. This will be
his last game on the coast this year, as he
goes East in a few days to pitch for the
Brooklyns. He pitched seven innings
and struck out eight menâ five in two
innings. During the first seven innings
only two men from San Francisco crossed
t c home plate and they on errors. Loch
head of Stockton took the batting honors,
but when he took Harper's place in the
eighth inning he did not pitch his usual
game and the San Franciscans made two
more runs. M. White and Harper of
Stockton both lined out two-baggers. Tbe
fielding honors went to Murphy, the Im
perials speedy third baseman. He won
the grand stand by a one-hand catch of a
foul that he had to run forty yard^ to get.
He made some splendid stops of fast
grounders.
Campbell and Long were the umpires
and J. Harr.b Harlan scorer. The runs
by innings were as follows:

BAKERSFIELD, Cal., April 11.â The
baseball contest here to-day between the
Republicans of Fresno and the Bakers

.the eighth inning, when the score stood
4to 3 in favor ot the Bakerstields. The
Fresno team was at the bat. The third
baseman caught a ball, made a touch-out,
and immediately tossed up the ball. Um
pire Burleigh of Fresno decided the man
was safe, on the ground that the ball was
juggled. A contention followed, when
t c game was called off. It was agreed to
refer the matter to President Young of
the National League for decision. Con
siderable money was up on the game. A
large crowd was present, and the contest
was an exceptional one until the disa
greement arose.

SANTA CRUZ. Cal., April 11.â The
Oakland baseball team came here to-day,
in the stead of the Caifornia Markets of
San Francisco, to meet the Santa Cruz
team at Yen de l'Eau. Santa Cruz beat the
visitors by a score of 9to 4. It was a slow
game, because of the ease with which
Santa Cruz played against the unequal
chances of the OaJclancih. Doyle of San
J.i-e pitched for the Santa Cruz team,
striking out twelve men. A feature of the
game was the heavy batting of the home
team.

Protection to B? Accorded to Ameri

SEATTLE, Wash., April 11.â Sidney
Stewart, late chief clerk of the Northern
Trust Company's bank at Chicago, and J.
T. Leipht, a real-eatate dealer of the same
city, who are here en route to the Alabka
gold fields, say that a squad of United
States police is to be stationed on the
Yukon this summer for the better protec
tion of American interests in that locality.
This steo, they state, is to be taken some
time in June, and in furtherance of it Eli
Gage and P. B. Weare, president of the
North American Trading and Transport
ing Company, which maintains a line of
steamers on the Yukon and also operates
extensively in other ways in Alaska, are
reported to have left Chicago last Satur
day for the National capital.
Weare is a son-in-law and Gage a son of
Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J.
Gage. Some six weeks aeo young Gage
passed through Seattle, en route to Chi
cago from Alaska, and while here he inti
mated to friends that such a more would
probably be made. It is supposed to have
been hastened by reason of the action of
the British Canadian Government in send
ing a second squad of Dominion police to
look after the interests of England's sub
jects in her far northern territory. The
second British police squad, numbering
twenty, arrived at Vancouver en route to
the Yukon several days ago.
It appears tnat the British Canadian
police have been particularly obnoxious
and offeniive to Americans engaged in
mining on the Alaska side, in that they
are given to rounding up all lawless and
vicious persons and driving them over on
to the United States, where they plunder
and terrorize Americans. Unjust customs
duties, it is said, are levied and complaints
have been maie by Alaskans since the
British mounted police was first stationed
on the Yukon some eighteen months ago.
Thorp had to pay a duty of 20 per ce*nt of
the cost price of the cattle h<> took before
he could land them on the Yukon.
Stewart and Leignt are heading for the
town of Dawion, N. W. T. They repre
sent they constitute an advance guard of

FAX QUENTIN, Cal., , April 11.âWil
liam Henry Theodore Durrant's first day
at the State prison at San Quentin
passed without incident. He appeared
unconcerned and spent his time in
quietude. No visitors called at the prison
to see him. His father did not come, nor
were bis legal advisers in evidence.
According :o the rules of the prison a
new prisoner must be measured. Dnrrant
was compelled to submit to this ordeal,
and the authorities put him through it in
a short time. He remained uncommuni
cative.
Tbe mnrderer finds that life here is a
trifle different from that In the County
Jail in San Francisco. There he was free
to see the papers and was granted other
favors. Here the journals are not allowed
to find their way into his bands and he is

The latest flutter among the chappies of
New York haÂ» been caused by the iseue of
cards for a bachelor tea to be given by a

for anything.

A movement baa been started in New

Merchants who do not advertise and

the i :streÂ«s;n.' significance of that coinci

mere chance. A merchant in an interior
town does not advertise, and y*et is always

T^'ii:::- cf the ; Itis c: hold
ing a carnival :- San Francisco tirfi year
enables -â¢ to * '.- cer ritf cc^r â¢ - *.t â¢â¢ on
the work of eonstmeiing the 6a.boa road.
This is by .-*!.â¢â¢ xafortczate. Work
on the borleTard will give employment to
men who seed it and the completion of
the enderttking will result ia a benefit far
greater thin any we could have attained
from a carnival, no matter how brilliant
and tzccttttzl it might have been.
>"'. Â» that we are free to direct every en
erjx to the work of constructing the road
we ihozli carry it forward with greater
-:r: : than ever, The subscriptions to the
fimd, which have been libexal in the past,
tÂ±b=Sdce even more so in the future.
T^shbs) e&odSd now De a generoas response
z.o lie call fcr money, and before the week
clones a raffifieot sum should be contrio-
Dted V 3 assure the completion of the work
without a day's delay.
I! we c nto have a carniral we could
etiily make sometnins of the kina by
celebrating the opening of the new boule-
Tard with a day of festivity ana parade. A
grand drive of richly adorned carriages,
accompanied by a gay cavalcade, followed
by a procession of bicyclist*, would make
:he opening of the new road a genuine
festival and proTlde for the people a holi
day that would be boih beautiful and en
joyable. It would not cost anything like
what a carnival would cost, but it would
be hardly less attractive as' a show and
fully as joyous for all who took part in it.
The issue before us then is to raise
money for the boulevard. LÂ»t us see to
it that thi* work is not suspended for a
single day until it has been fully com
pleted- Every citizen in proportion to his
means should contribute to the fund.' It
is a measure devised by public Â«plrit for
the public benefit and rightly appeals to
the public for y;pr>ort.
All who intended to subscribe to the
carnival should turn their subscriptions
over to the boulevard. The pleasure to
be received from the completion of that
work will be not less in intensity and
much greater in duration than any that
could have been expected through tee
carnival. Wden the road is completed and
opened every citizen will feel a gratifica
tion in knowing that he gave active help
and aid In the undertaking. It will be a
pleasure as well as an honor to be in
cluded among tboie whose liberality and
generosity have enabled the City to give
work to the unemployed and wages to the
industrious while adorning itself with so
magnificent a highway as the Balboa
road. 4*:
WOELD MAPS 01 1337 ASD 1897.
The latest volume of "The Etatetman's
Year Book" contains a number of maps
Bbowin'e tae comparative condition of the
is to political geography :n lS37and
IfBT taa Â«Dan of sixty years covering the
re kb of Qaeen Victoria, and it is interest
ing to note tbe changes that have Deen
wrought in that time.
he rat.: s of Europe tbe most notable
changes are in tbe regions platted in this
year's map in soiid colors a? r >errnany and
Italy. Comparing this with the map that
shows EuropÂ« at the time Victoria
ascended the British throne wÂ« see tl.e
region now covered by the Italian and
German empires cut up into a multiplic
ity of petty Statea. Another striking
chang? is MÂ«a in tbe maps of the Balkan
paninsula. Turkey in that region baa
been lessened by the severing of Ken
mania, 't-.z-.-a.. B jigaria and Montenegro.
in the two maps of Alia the most no
ticeable difference is the spread of the
British and the KuÂ«*ian empires. Vic
toria, Kmp;ess of ladia, j.oi reijjni ever
tbe wbo:e of finrmah, the islands of Bor
neo, Sumatra ana their neighbors, nearly
the whole extent of Hindoo:tan, and so
far to the north that only the land of tbe
Afghans i;es between bar dominions tni
those of the great r'.Tal empire oi Russia.
The Flowery Kingdom siili stretches
almost unchanged over an area vast as
Europe, but owing to the suddenly devel
oped warlike prowess of her little neigh
bor, Japan, the peninsula of Korea is no
longer mapped as part of the Chinese em
pire. Russia has stretched herself south
ward -and swallowed Tartary whole, and
that country, as bi# as India, has disap
peared from the map. Russia now bor
ders upon Persia and Afghanistan, with
the exception of a slender strip of inde
pendent territory along the river Oxus as
It flows to the Aral Sea. A'nam has
passed to the French, and the other
changes are minor.
Africa then and Africa now make inter
esting maps to study. In 1537 Egypt for
Turkey, and Cape Colony for Britain, like
two little bites out of an immense pie,
were about all it was worth while for the
mapmakerto color and bound with the
claims of any nation's possession in all
that vast continent whose interior was an
unknown world. Now it is blocked like a
checkerboard with the colors that mark
the claims of the British, Germans,
French, Portuguese, Italians, Spaniards
and Turks.
Far in the interior of the Soudan the
warlike natives that fought with such
fanatic zeÂ»: for the Mah ii Btill
hold their country free from the domina
tion of any civilized power, and on the

bounded. The only thine; else that has

In South America the states of Pata

Brazil haÂ» remained stationary. Chile

the whole tea coast cf Bolivia, and,
stretching far to the south like an enor
mous boa constrictor, has swallowed a.
that narrow part of Patagonia which lay
between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean.
New Grenada has been transmuted into
Colombia, and the Venezuela boundary,
which awakened tne long dormant doc
trine of Monrot, is still unsettled.
In Australia England has had it all her
own way, aad the island-continent, which

SALT RIVER VALLEY.
A Beautiful Region of Arizona That

Dr. GÂ«orge E. Goodfellow of Tucson,
Territorial Health Officer of Arizona, is
in the City. The doctor figures that the
Territory has the required population for
statehood, hut holds that the citizens are
quite well pleased with territorial govern
ment. Tlie custom ol selecting a resident
ot the Territory for Governor gires gen
Â«=;Â«'â  sattAfaction. A new Governor is soon
U> M chosen and several well-known resi
dents are aspirants for the honor.
ThÂ« imputation of Arizona in steadily
Increasing and many of the new-comers
are people of means and influence. The
dÂ«r*U>rmetit of Salt River Valley by rea
son of irrigation has rendered that region
of the Territory a favored place as a win
ter resort. The number of wealthy and
cultured people who elect to spend the
winter there increases with each succeed
ing season. The valley, with its beauti
ful towns and villages, now sustains a
population ot 30,000. "The old ruins occa-
Monallr brought to light indicate that the
valley 1000 years ago wa- densely settled
and perhaps supported 100,000 people.

The Bookbinders' Protective and Bene

day evening held a special meeting to dis
cus* the action of Governor Badd in veto
ing the Stste Printer's appropriation bill, i
which provided the means for conducting j
the State printing office for the next two
! years. As a result strong resolutions con
demning such action were Dassed. These
recited t at the Siate printing office is es- i
tablished by Jaw for the purpose of doing
the printing for the State, which includes :
the text- books for the public schools.
A large number of workmen are em
ployed in this work, and they are de
prived from earning a living by the Gov
ernor's act. The union considers that the
Governor has worked a Mriotu hard ship
on the men and their families, and the
resolution concludes by saying:

It seems to you that that
tickling, hacking cough is all
in the throat. But your doc-
tor will tell you that this sen-
sation is often deceiving. The
cough is often the signal of
deeper trouble in the bron-
chial tubes or in the lung
tissue itself. These inflamed
membranes can only be
healed by treating the system.
For all lung troubles, espe-
cially in the earlier stages, no
remedy equals Scott's Emul-
sion of Cod-liver Oil. Its
special power is in healing
the inflamed tissues of the
lungs.

The discourse of Deacon Webbei

FIEST DAY OP OSICKET.
The Aiameda and Golden Gate Elevens
Opened the Season.
The opening cricket match of the season
was played at Aiameda yesterday, the
event being "Ground vs. Ground." The
perfect weather attracted quite a crowd of
spectators, and the field presented an nn
nsually festive appearance. The cricket
was inevitably rather slack owing to most
of the men being entirely out of practice,
but there were some very creditable per
formances with both cat and ball.
The first Bide to bat was that from
Golden Gate. W. J. Robertson and Price,
who opened the innings, did most of the
scoring, none of their successors reaching
double fieures, and the entire total
reached was but 53.
The Aiameda men did not do much bet
ter than their opponents, man for man,
and they clearly owed their victory to the
fxcelient batting of F. Sewell, the new
Pacific captain. Hood aad Hoyne both
showed something of their wonted skill.
W. Robertson bowled during the whole of
their innings and showea that his recent
accident has not impaired his skill as a
trundler.
Regarded generally, the r>lay on both
*ides gave promise of all-round improve
ment on that of last season.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 12, 1897.
was with the pastor on the platform and j
made an address concerning the work of !
the committee of which he is chairman. !
Mr. Boynton spoke in part as follows:
Much depends upon a right conception of
labor. Labor is not a curse. It is not a result i
of Adam's disobedience as much as It Is the
cure lor all the ills following the fall of our '
first parents.
Labor's strong arm delivers from many ills.
Temptation is overcome, sleeplessness Is
routed, heavy hour; take wings and fly away,
all our food is sweetened, days become a de
light, nights a blessing and life one long
dream realized. One has sung: â¢
Labor is rest from tha sorrows that greet us,
From an the petty vexations that meet us,
>rom the sin promptings that assail us,
From the world sirens that lure us to ill.
When the gate of the first paradise closed
God in his great mercy opened anotherâ that
was the gate to useful labor.
Times of deepest degradation for the race !
nave been those when labor was dishonored I
ana the laborer despised. The race has only
grown in wisdom and stature when labor's
strong arm has been allowed to lift itself in
greatest honor and freedom. Labor'd feet are
not in the way that goeth down to the pit but
on the golden highway that leadcth up to the
city ere the divina carpenter sits upon the
throne. Though the feet may -weary and the
heart and head grow sick in tne struggle, it is
that the toiler may hear the divine laborer
say, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavily laden and I will give you rest."
Were it not for the tired body the soul might
never answer the loving call of the Christ
Labor, thou art royal; born in paradise, thou
hast grown under the guiding hand of thlue
author until that which was the burden of the
slave has become tne wings upon which man
has soared from serfdom to sonship with the
creator.
The Balboa boulevard is a temporary meas
ure as a relief of the sufferer, and not the
place wnere labor snail find a living the year
around. We hall with heartiest co-operation j
this enterprise as a measure for the relief of
the mother and children, but we would wel
come more warmly an adjustment or existing
conditions that would give labor its rightful
wage and place in the body politic. Founda
tion i tones of the Republic are labor; recog
nize this and build the State upon it, and there
shall never be a tremor; reverse this order,
and the stones of labor will crumble the State
to powder. Freedom does not come from the
State to labor, but from labor to the State. 1
love American labor, and in the words of
Daniel Webster, I exclaim: "All my sympa
thies are with it, ana my voice, till I an
dumb, will be for it."
Many Ways Lead
To Repentance.

Arthur H. Clark preached last night

AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
No Good Scores Made on the San

The extreme heat, the Rlarinj; iicht on
the targets and a Jack of enthusiasm had
their effect upon the scores made at

day.
The Pioneers held their annual picnic,
j but the attendance was slight, and what

generally on repentance, sin and tbe
teachings of the church.
"There are several ways for people to
become better," said the speaker, "several
wava for them to learn of the existence
of God and the way of light. First, there
is the voice of God in the human soul, and
this we call reason; then God presents
himself to the sonl by his messenger?, or
priests, in sertnuns â and there are object
ie.-sons like the imposing ceremonials of
the church."
, The speaker hold tbat there are, in a
way, saints and sinners in the church â
some good, some bad â the pood are not
good absolutely, but "relatively so."
A striking part of the sermon was the
conclusion, wherein the speaker treated
of the duty of iorgetfulness regarding past
sins.
"Life Is too busy, too fnll of cares for us
to lose time looking back over evils that
are passed and atoned for.
"We must not cry over error 3 that have
been remedied, for in these cases the war
is over. Duty says, 'Look ahead!" The
future is the field, never again the past."
There will be services at St. Marv'o by
the PauMst Fathers this week every even

as follows: Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

The Triumphal Entry of
Christ Into Jerusalem.
YESTERDAY at St. John's Episcopal
Church Rev. Dr. Spalding preached on
Christ's entry into Jerusalem, and told
how on Pii'.m Sunday so many years ago a
great multitude followed Jesus singing hosan
nas and praise. His disciples and friends
must have thought that he v as now going to
enter into his kingdom. They did not know
that his was to De a heavenly and not an
earthly one, that his crown was to be one of
thorns. The speaker went on to tell of the
Master's life during the following week, of
how he wept over Jerusalem as he looked
down through the ages to its destruction, of
his cleansing the temple, of St. Peter's denial,
of his sufferings and his trial, and finally of
his death upon tne cross for the sins ot the
world. He exhorted each one to think of the
love which was manifested by the Savior's
life, to take him as a personal Savior and real- i
ize that he died for e&ch one of us.
The Cross as a Symbol
of the Regenerated Soul.
REV. J. S. DAVID of the Swedenborg
Mission Society explained thesymbology
of the cross and the crucifixion at
Washington Hall yesterday, illustrating his
sermon by several pictures of crosses in
various forms used by fraternities \>i high
antiquity. In exoteric Christianity, he said,
the cross stands for self-denial and the devel
opment of the spiritual through suffering.
The spirit crosses the tendencies of the flesh,
and thus the flesh or carnal nature is crossed
or crucified. The Roaierucian symbol of the
croos and the rose represented the suppression
of the carnal desires and thence the uufold
inK and iragrance of the spiritual life. The
ancient Egyptian Crux Ansaia, shaped like a
T surmounted by a circle, was the symbol of
in. mortality, life without beplnning or end.
In the deeper Christianity, as unfolded by
Swedenborg, the cross signifies the marriage
of the good and the true in the regenerated
eoul, the result of the crucifixion of the carnal
CRUSHED UNDER
A CABLE-CAR
Serious Accident to A. G.
Maass, a Deputy
Assessor.
Knocked Off His Bicycle by a
Haight-iStreet Car Without
Warning.
He Sustained a Fracture of the Spine
and Contusions on the Head
and Shoulder.
A. G. Maass. a deputy in the Assessor's
office, living at 1007 Golden Gate avenue,
met with an accident yesterday morning
tnat will in all probability make him an
invalid for the remainder of his life.
He is an ardent bicyclist, and was riding
on the cartrack along Market street to the
ferry to catch the 10 o'clock boat for Oak
land.
After passing Steuart street there was a
Castro-street car in front of him, and as
he had ten minutes to spare before the
boat left he rode leisurely behind the car.
Unknown to him Huicht-street car No.
146 was following close behind him. The
cars before approaching East street slacken
their speed, as a rule, and Maass -had no
thought of the danger lurking behind him.
Just before reacmng East, street the
Ilaieht-street car, without any warning,
â track Maass' bicycle and knocked him
off. He fell on his face in the center of ;
tne track, and before the grijiman, vrbo at !
once applied tne brakes, could stop it, the ;
front of the car bad passed over Maass and '
the fender rested upon his back.
There was a rush made for the car by
people who were walking on the side
walks, and the passengers, gripman and
conductor jumped off and pushed the car
back off the prostrate form of Maass. He !
was dragged out in an unconscious condi- j
tion and tenderly carried to a atore 'â 
close at hand. The ambulance was sum
moned and he was taken to the Receiving :
Hospita l , where he soon recovered con- :
sci lusness.
Dr. Woil found that Maass' lower limbs I
were paralyzed, caused by a fracture of I
the suine, and bis right shoulder and head
were contused. Last evening he was re
moved to the German Hospital, where an i
operation will likely be performed, as a \
last resort, to save him from permanently j
losing the use of his lower limbs,
Maass is a comparatively young man and
lived with his parents. Speaking of the
accident he said: "There was a Castro- i
street car in front of me as I pasied !
Steuart street and all my attention was j
occupied in watching it, as it might stop j
at any second and I did not want to run â¢
into it. I preferred to follow leisurely I
behind it as I had ten minutes al my dis
posal.
"I was not aware that a Haight-street !
car was following close behind me and I
suppose it kept crawling up to me. I did
not hear any bell ringing behind me,
when suddenly I was Knocked off my bi
cycle and then ail was a blank until I I
found myself in the hospital.
"A young man who took care of my
bicycle called at the hospital ana told me
the car that struck me was No. 146 of the
Haight-street line and that be noticed
the gripman talking to a passenger on
the dummy just before I was struck. If
the gripman had bnen looking ahead, as
he ought to have been, he would have
rung his bell an<J I would have got off the
track."
DROWNED AT NORTH BEACH.
William FrftÂ»er Goel in Swimming and
Sinks to the Bottom.
William Fraser, 21 years of ape, who re
sided with his parents at 2931 Laguna
street, was drowned in the bay off the foot
of Buchanan street at 5 o'clock last even
ing.
The young man, accompanied by sev
eral friends, went to North Beach in the
afternoon for the purpose of taking a
desires. The>long beam symbolizes goodness,
the crossbeam truth, and the two are united
in a cross when truth leads to goodness of Hie
and enters into marriÂ«s6 therewith. The
cube has a similar for the cube
unfolded mates the cross. The true length
and breadtii of the ordinary ancient cross was
in the relation of four to three, these num
bers, when taken together, representing the
good and the true. Adding four and three to
gether gives ms the sacred number, which
symbolizes the celestial Sabbath of the soul.
This is attained alter passing through six days
or states of labor iv which tlio soul has borne
the cross all the way. The crucifixion of the
Lord denotes the temDtations that he suffered
a:i'l overcame, resulting in the union oi his
human nature with his divine nature.
Feeding the Five
Thousand Hungry.
H. J. Callis of A. M. E. Zion Cnurch
selected as the text for hid sermon last
evening the fourteenth verse sixteenth
chamer of Mathew. "But Jesus said unto
them, tbey need not depart, give ye them
to eat."
In part. Rev. Calli3 said:
"The food which the mass of the church
goers offer to the world is no better than
that which the world has, so the worid
will not receive it. The fish and bread,
after passing through the hands of our
Lord and then from the di?cir>les to the
people, was changed. Before they had
handled it it was nothing but common
tisli and bread, bin after passing througn
their hands it became divine. So our
Lord wants us, as did his disciples, to
obey Mm and we will be able to feed the
w^rld.
"If as disc pies of our Lord we wish to
win the worla we must hold out to the
world something that is better than the
world has."
Star Fell as the
Trumpet Sounded.
Dr. Hempbill delivered a sermon in
Calvary Presbyterian Church last evening
on the topic, "'Apocalyptic Visions in the
Light of Present European Complica
tions." lie said:
"The seer of Patmos heard seven trump
ets sounding. Four have reference to tne
Roman Empire and three to things more
modern. Tne lust three are called the
| woe trumpets. With the sounding of the
j first woe trumpet a star fell. Mohammed
i was thatâ a falling star â the principality
! of Mecca, his by birtb, belonging to an
{ other. A key was given to him and he
i opened the bottomless pit, and cut of it
came smoke and locusts and lions, and
horses and scorpions. Arabia ia the origi
nal borne of the locust, the horse, the
jion and tue scorpion. The symbolism is
I all Arabian. And from Arabia the fol
lowers of Mohammed came, countless as
! locusts, mounted on horses, fierce as
i hons, with a scorpion, like venom for all
j Christians, with faces like men and long
i bair like women.
"Power was given to torment men 'five
montus' â that is, 150 years of actnal time.
Mohammed proclaimed his mission in 612.
In 7t>2 the Caliphate was removed to
Bagdadâ exactly 150 years, during which
swim. They entered the water, but haa
on iy been there a few moments when
Fraser was taken with a cramp. He
shouted for help, but in an instant sank to
the bottom. The friends of the drowning
man made frantic effors to assist him, but
without avail. A grappling-iron was se
curea and at 5:30 o'clock Edward Maloney
succeeded in recovering the body, which
was taken ashore. The Coroner's office
was then notilied and the body was re
moved to the Morgue.

I venom of tLeir stings. The Saracens are
not the descendants of Sara, as their name
implies, but of Hagar. the bondwoman,
and ought to be called Hagarenes.
"Does John say anything about the
present condition of the Turks? He does.
'The sixtn angel poured out his via! upon
tne Â«reat river Euphrates, and the water
thereof was dried up.' That is what is
happening to Turkish power. It is dry
ing up. Tte great powers are nursing
'the sick mat).' not because they love him,
but because they hate each other. They
cannot keep him alive, and the sooner he
dies the better. Lamariine wiote:
â¢Turkey is dying for want of Turks.' It
is true. Decay is at work there, and no
power can stay it la their mode of life
the Turks disclose the prophecy of their
own extinction. The Euphrates' flood is
drying up.
"I fear tnere will be war over the Turk
ish question. War is evil, but not always.
Sometimes it is the surgeon's knife. A
Turkish cancer is eating into the heart of
European civilization, and maybe war is
the only way to cut it out. This, I believe,
is the divine intention concerning Turkey.
It has cursed civilization and Christianity
long enough â too long."
Light of Asia
or Life of Christ.
Dr. F. J. Masters, who has spent ten
years in China, Jast evening delivered a
sermon upon "The Light of Asia or the
Lifcht of the World." He gave Buddimm
credit for teaching many beautiful truths.
He admired Sakyamouni's doctrine of
universal brotherhood, the catholicity of
spirit that opposed the abominable caste
system of India and recognized the
brother in every garb and in every com
munion. Some of the Buddhist sutras
glowed with an inspiration almost divine.
The sutra of forty-two sections contained
truths as pure as the Sermon on the Mount.
It inculcated inward as well as outward
purity. It taught the forgiveness of in
jury; to return good for evil; when smit
ten be not angry; and it defined goodness
as the agreement of the will with the con
science.
Another Buddhist doctrine was that of
Karmaâ the luw of consequences. Every
thing was fixed by an eternal aad inex
orable law of necessity. A man was be
lieved to reap in this life exactly what he
had sown in a former stale of Deing and
no power in heaven or earth could reverse
his fate. The next point touched upon
was Sakyamouni's view of life. Until
Nirvana was reached there was no rest.
I: may take long, long kalpas of time to
wean a man from earth. Suicide only
prolongs the agony. The suicide would
come back into life in a lower and more
bestial shape. No rest comes uutil the
Karma is all used up and the ascending
series of transformations are completed
and the clarified soul slips into Nirvana.
What a contrast is that sweet vision of
eternal life in Christ, and that sinless,
sorrowless immortality brought to life.
After reviewing these Oriental religions
Dr. Masters compared them with the reli
gion of Christ.

Munyon's Medical Institution, 1505 Arch
street. Philadelpnia, Pa., is the best one of
its kind in the world. It employs a large
staff of skilled specialists to diagnose the
cases not only of people applying person-
ally for treatment, but those in all parts of
the country who send in personal letters,
asking the best methods of being cured of
various diseases. Thousands of these let-
ters are received every week, and a staff of
from ten to fifteen doctors are daily em-
ployed in dictating replies through the
medium of as many stenographers. These
letters are received in the strictest confi-
dence and promptly answered with the
best medical advice obtainable. No effort
will be spared to see that each case is thor-
oughly diagnosed and the proper reme-
dies to effect a cure are prescribed. For
these services no fee is expected. .
Prof. Munyon puts up a separate cure for
each disease. At all druggists, mostly 25
cents a vial.

SHE WAS TOO
KIND-HEARTED
The Grandmother Could
Not L?ave the Lit
tle One.
After Abandoning a Bab? an
Old Couple Return to Their
Sorrow.
They Were Trying to Hide a Daugh
ter's Sham . but Mad; a
S rious M stp.'.cs.
Tbe aged couple who were arrested i
Saturday night for having placed an in- i
fant on the steps of a store at 218 McAllis- ;
ter street, with the intention, as was then '
supposed, of abandoning it, were yester- I
day released. An able detective was i
placed on the case yesterday morning by i
Captain Boben, and at 5 o'clock yesterday 1
M Zella Fay," the Little Girl Whose Grandparents Left Her on the
Steps of a Store Which They Thought Was a Foundling Asylum.
afternoon be reported thtt there was
nothing in the action of the old people
which warranted their detention.
In the meantime at the City Prison the
little one was beinp tenderly cared for by
the matron. It is such a wee fait of hu- i
inanity that the doctors of the hospital
guessed its age at one week. Its grand
father, however, says four weeks is nearer
the ijgure, as the child was born March 10.
The cane is bat another phase of the sad
story oi woman's weakness and mnn's au
â Dlicity. Had the grieJ-ctricken pair, in
tent upon hiding the shame of an erring
daugnter, been more worldly wise or â 
harder of heart their plans need not have
miscarried. To-day the little waif would
be tenderly cared for by the sisters of St.
Joseph's Asylum, and the repentant
mother would be loosing forward to the
time when her child, the adopted daugh
ter of a widowed sister, could b a ever near
her and would be the object of no one's
scorn.
The plan as orginally outlined was for ,
the old folks to leave their country home j
with the child, and upon arrival in this
< ity. take it at once to St. Joseph's '
Asylum. There, the Sisters have provided j
a receptacle at the door for just such un
fortunates. In this the child was to be
deposited, the bell was to be rung br the
old man, and ere the Sisters arrived the I
sorrowing pair would depart. Later, a
member of the family would adopt ihe
child, and later, the parents, who are
soon to be wed, would take the little one
to their home.
On the arrival of the grandparents in
this City they were told that at 218 McAl
lister street was such an institution as
they desired. In fact the secretary of an
eleemosynary institution has an office
there for business purposes only.
At 10 o'clock Saturday night they sur
reptitiously approached this place and de
posited their precious charge. Reluctantly
they started away, but within a block or
two the heart of the grandmother fuiled
her. Perhaps she had maternal misgiv
ings that the little one had managed to
kick away some of its loose coverings. She
suggested that they return to the spot and
look at the child. Her husband, nothing
loath, consented. There it lay snug and
quiet just as they had left it.
"Hiram," said the only lady, "I am go
inp to take ii away. It might lie there all
night."
"Take it away goes," said Hiram, and
he reached for the little one. Two young
men were approaching, and he hastily set
it down to let them pass. They saw him
and demanded it it was his bundle. He
said it wai, and that it contained a child.
Then one held him while the other went
for the police.
That is the story of the abandoned
foundling as told by the aged grandfather.
"Leave that child on a doorstep all
night?" he ejaculated as tears came to his
eyes, "why, I would sooner died than
have done it. I intended to wait until I
fohw it was taken."
Then he spoke of the child's mother,
who had always been respected in the
neighborhood for her goodness. He won
dered anxiously if they would let dim
take the child home with him. and in
quired more anxiously if his wife was
all right. They had kept them in remote
cells.
"To-morrow," he said, "we will return
at once to â " and he named the town
where he is known as a hard-workiug,
respectable man.
"If tbe names could only be kept from
tbe papers," said the old man eagerly,
"part of the scandal might be averted. "
And after all, the name* and placedon't
matter much â not so much as refraining
from adding one straw to the burdens of
that unfortunate old couple.

door gatherings of local wheelmen from a
single club ever held, and also proved one
of the most enjoyable. About a dozen
members of the Bay City Wheelmen and
iom>' others were also present as invited
guests.
The party, numbering lully 150. left
here on tbe 10 o'clock boat for Sausalito.
and took the train to ban Anselmo. riding
back from there to EscÂ»lies.
Beiore lunch there were numerous
games. Jack Cunningham won the 100
--yard dash in 10 2-5 seconds, Wilbur Knapp
second. Freu Butz and Phil Fay won tne
three-legged race. A "partnership" race,
one man carrymp his partner on his back,
wont to Frank O'Kane and Jack Cathcart.
Knapp and D>oÂ«an looked to be sure
winners of this event, but Doogan tumbled
near the tape, sending Knapp sprawline
ten feet away. The result was ludicrous.
The moil interesting event was a mile
liHn;lirap race, won by Roy Barney from
TO yards; Dr. Pinching, 05 yards, second;
W." S. Baron, scratch, third.
Ju'lge Kerrigan, Ferris Hartman, .lames
Swinnerion, George Wet more and Sandy
Pluramer were the officials.
Alter a splendid lunch spread in the
cool shade, an excellent musical and lite
rary fiitertainment was provided, consisi
ing oi numbers by Morris Cramer, Joe
Desmond, Wilbur Knapp, Ben Tarbox,
Will Uallett, James Swinnerton, Hynes,
Nelson, Jack Cooney and others.
The run for home was led by Captain
Morel late in the evening, every one voting
that tue outing was one of the best the
club members have ever enjoyed.
The Olympic Cyclers also had as quests
a boat.- crew from tlie club's rowing asso
ciation. In tbe boat's crew were F. A.

the latter port a stop of twenty-four hours
was made to enable the Chinese Minister
to inquire into some matters in connec
tion with cooly labor on the islands. The
steamer brought 110 55 cabin passengers,
17 Chinese and 3 Europeans in the second
class and 47 Japanese for a colony in Mex
ico and 202 Chinese in the steerage. Of
the latter nearly all are bound for Na6b-
Tille, Teun., where they are to form part
of a Chinese village. They are only the
advance guard, however, as at least 1500
more oi their countrymen ara expected
nere on succeeding steamers. The coolies
come here on the understanding that they
are to go back to China within a year, but
like the Midwinter Fair Chinese they will
vanish into thin air as soon as the day ol
departure comes. It is safe to say that
not five out of every hundred that co to

a year.

tug Vigilant. Dr. Bunnell, who was act
inn for Dr. Chalmers, the State quarantine
officer, ordered them back aboard again
and went through all the papers before he
allowed tnem to land. Captain fciilovichof
the Vigilant was anery at having to go
back to the Wilder, Captain McNeal was
as mad as a hatter, the passengers were
wondering what it all meant and the crew
called down blessings on the doctor's head
because they had to go through another
mustering. In the meantime the men on
the Andrew Welch had to possess their
souls in patience until the quarantine
officer was through with the Wilder.
Mrs. C. A. Camp of 1239 Market street
had a remarkable experience Just Satur
day evening. She was on her fay to By

at t>ie ferries pulled out her handkerchief
and with it a roll o! $"iooin greenbacks. She
never noticed her loss and a few minutes
later a couple of adorn came along and
one of them, kicking the roll into a cor
ner, remarked, "That's theater money,"
meaning the imitation greenbacks
nsed on the stage. Soon after
ward two cr.ppled newspaper ped
dlers saw the money scattered around
and gathered it in. Harry Campbell se
cured $250 and Tim Casey $200. A few
minutes later a hunter picked up $35 and
went to the ticket-window wii.i it. The
ticket aeent knew nothing about the mat
ter, and the hunter went away saying he
would cail again this morning to see if
there was any claimant. The hunter vsÂ»
hardly out of tne way before another man
came along with a $5 bill he had found,
and still another came on his heels. Mrs.
Camp was the last one to appear and she
was in tears. She told tier tale of woe
and he police were called in. Cameron
and Casey had been talking about their
"find." and they were taken before Cap
tain Dunleayy, where they at once deliv
ered ud the money. The $35 picked up by
the burner and the two $5 bills reported
by the passengers on the boat will be
forthcoming this morning, ho that Mtb.
Camp will only be a loser to the extent oi
$5, for which she ought to be more than
thankful.

NOTES OF THE
NATIONAL GUARD
Officers Will Ask for Regi
mental Camps This
Year.
Members of tbe Guard Want to
Know What Has Become of
the Inspector.
Ceremonies by th? Companies of the
Second Battalion, Pint Regiment,
Second Brigade.
Now that the appropriation for the
National Guard of the State has been made
the talk in all directions is "camp," but
there is no certainty as to what camp will
be ordered by the commander-in-chief,
whether it will be a division, brigade or
regimental camp. The matter has been
pretty fully discussed by the officers of
the several regiments and while Major-
General James would like a division en
campment the majority of the officer-* are
in favor of regimental camps. These
urgue that as the men have not been to
camp for tbree years and many are new,
never having been to a camp before, they
would not have the opportunity to learn
as much ma division encampment as they
would at a regimental camp for the reason
that they would be called upon to learn
too many new movements in a very lim
ited space of time.
Our National guardsmen it should be
remembered aie not as well tap in the
school of the soldier as are the regulars
who have nothing to engross their attention
but the study under severe disciplinarians of
all that goes to make up a true soldier and it
should not be expected that the guardsmen
can go into the field and in a seven days' camp
master all the intricacies of the movements
that govern as large a body of men as would
assemble at a division encampment. In order
to improve the guardsmen tney should first
be well instructed in the school of the com
pany, then in the school of battalion, then in
me evolutions of the reeiiuent, tnen of the
brigade, and when they are well up In these
they can then dtvote some attention to di
vision matters.
From the talk of officers connected with the
First Infantry and the Fifth Infantry of ihe
Second Brigade it is likely that these will ask
for regimental camps, and that within a lew
days.
The matter of inspections has been very
much retarded this jeer. Op to date but one
inspection has been ordered â that of the sev
enth Regiment. First Brigade. This wascom
menced ou last Wednesday. Orders have Dot
yet been issued for others, although brig
ailer-geneials have been asked to fix dates.
The officials who have charge of arranging
the State shoois are at work, but the guards
men have come to the conclusion that the
work is progressing siowly und that if order.->
are not issued soon there will be some con
flict with ihe law Â»b to the number ol shoots
that the men will have to take part in.
Another matter that has set the guardsmen
to talking it the absence from the armories of
Captain W, de L. Carrington, U. S. A., specially
detailed by the War Department as inspector
of the National Guard ot this State. He did
inspect the guard in July of last year and pre
sented ins reDort, which is i> rimed in the
adjutant-general's report, but since then he
has not been seen where the companies meet.
It may be that there are some of our guards
men who do not kr ow as much about military
matters as they might, but they are of the
opinion that the captain who Is paid by the
liovernment, and has no other duty to per
form than that for which he is detailed should,
in his capacity as inspector, make periodicnl
visits to the armories, watch the drills and
make such comments as would enable the of
ficers and the men to correct errors that they
may fall into, and they think further that he
ought to meet occasionally with the board of
officers and discuss matiers that would in
crease the efficiency of the guard. They < ay
that if an officer of the United States Army is
to make an inspection only once a year the
War Department could detail an officer tor
that purpose for a limited period, and that af
ter having performed that duty he should re
turn to his post. It is just possible. M said be
fore, that these guardsmen do not know as
much abeut military matters as they niiuht.
but their logic Â«eems sound, and if the inspec
tions by the officer detailed for that purpose
were as they tuggest the service would be the
gainer, and could be made more efiective.
Colonel Hyman V. Bush, retired, has been
appointed judge advocate on the division staff
with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, vice
James F. Smith, elected colonel of the First

The Second Brigade.
Major Charles L. Tilden, Third Battalion,
First Regiment Infantry, has been granted
leave of absence for sixty days, with permis
sion to leave the State on account of ill
health. Some time spo he contracted a severe
cold, and under medical advice he has eonc
to a warmer climate lor a time. He has se
lected Arizona as his temporary home.
Last Wednesday evening the Second Battal
ion, Major Hugh T. Simc, whlcb includes
Companie!) M, Captain O'Neil; L. CaptÃin Eg
gert; B, Captain Film er, and H, Captain War
ren, had ceremonies in the regimental armory
at I'ago and Onk streets in the presence ot a
large number of persons, including about 200
lad.es and Mayor Phelau.
There was a battalion drill; then Lieuten
ant-Colonel Duboee wan tendered a battalion
review; Company B. Captain Filmer, gave an
exhibition ot the bayonet drill, and tne cere
monies closed with a dres^ parade, given to
Captain O'Neil, the senior caDtaiu ol the bat
talion.
After that the men who won medals at the
Slate stiooi were called to the front and were,
by Mayor Phelau, presented with the medals
t.iey had won, the presentation being pref
aced by a short eloquent address.
Within two weeks the Finn Battalion, Major
Charles Boxton, will give like ceremonies In
the regimental armory.
Tue Cadet Corps of the Lowell High School,
Captain L,. K. r.dwards commanding, will in
the near luture give an exuibition diill and
dance- in the regimental armory, but the date
has not yet been fixed.
Companies C and G (the Nationals) con tem
plate Riving a minstiel entertainment at an
early day.
A number of improvements have been made
in the quarters of Company X, Captain Thomas
J. Cunningham, at the armory, 815 Kills
street, of iate, under the direction of the cap
tain, who is displaying a great deal 01 interest
in his command nnd doing his best to bring it
up to a standard that no other company will
excel. Tne room that was known as the "hat
room" has been fitted up for the use of the
quartermaster. A number of shelve" have
been put after the manner that such are put
in the United States Army quarters and 0:1
those is placed clothing neaily folded, each
class segregated and each piece numbered as
10 size so that when a desired size is wanted
ji may be obtained without talcing down *
whole stack 01 articles.
{Then there are a number of shelves set aside
hats. Jt shows that the captain has the
bump of order largely developed, and that he
wants a place lor everything and everything
in its place. Auother room, long and narrow,
has been fitted with harness hooks in the
wÂ«llt, each numbered. On each hook there in
a blanket roll, leggings, knapsact, overcoat,
canteen and service hat. Tuft the captain
call* the 'â¢emergency room." In case of a
sudden call lor the men, each one knowing
his number will go to the room, give his
number and will be given in a moment all
that he needs to prepare himself alter he has
donned his uniform. An illustration of the
system showed that there is a great saving of
lime in preparing the men in the event of an
emergency calL

Signal Corps, Third Brigade.
The Signal Corps, Third Brigade, made a very
plucky attempt to break the State record tor
signaling on Sunday, the 3d inst., the stations
selected being Mount Diablo and Marysville
Buttes, a trifle over ninety-twomiles in an air
line.
The Mount Diablo squad, headed by Major
Douelus. signal officer, with Sergeants Bailey
and Byrne and Corporal Taylor, leit Sacra
mento oa Saturday's morning train. From
Muni nt z they drove to Clayton, where horses
wen procured and the ascent of the moun
tain begun. After a hard climb the summit
was reached at 6 o'clock Saturday evening. A
fire was started and the weary soldiers sought
sleep on the softest side of the rocks which
Utter the top of Diablo.
They were up betimes, and after breakfast
waited long and patiently for the clouds to
break. A wind was coming in from the ocean,
carrying with it large banks of clouds and
haze, and the sun shone at only fitlul inter
vals. A glimpse of a faint o'utiine of the
Buttes was caught, but at very rare intervals,
and then only for a few seconds, and it was
with disappointed hearts thai stations were
closed about noon.
The Marysville squad, which was accompa
nied by Colonel Peeler, Assistant Adjutant-
General Peeler and Lieutenant Charles E. Du
hain of Troop B, cavalry, cousi-ied of Lieu
tenant K. L. Martin, Sergeant Watkins and
Private May. Lieutenant Duhain. an old resi
dent of Marysville, acted as advance agent for
the boys, taking tne morning train on Satur
day for Marysville. the balance of the squad
following him in the evening. A start was
made by team fur the Buttes early Sunday
morning. On reaching the base of the moun
tains the work commenced in earnest.
Littered ilown with heliographs, telescopes,
canteens, lunch, kodak, overcoats, etc., the
climb commenced. To add to the discomfort
of tne boys, the sun came out about an hour
too early, and it was finally decided that the
overcoats, at least, be discarded half way up
the mountain. After a heavy climb the foot
of the crags on South Butte was reached and
instruments adjusted. Aoout 10 o'clocic the
clouds gave promise of breaking, the Capitol
aud other prominent buildings in Sacramento
being visible to the naked eye, but off toward
the bay the fog and clouds" seemed to be con
tinually siil ting. The summit of Diablo could
be seen, and a steady flash was kept on it until
2 o'clock, but no response was received, and
station*, were closed. It was thus that the Sig
nal Corps, Third Brigade, failed.
Lieutenant Martin is well pleased with the
trip, however. He is especialiy pleased with
the South Butte as a signal station. He says
that off to the west the snow-capped summits
of the Sierras were p.ainly visible, aud a wide
range for signaling is offered: but that
the prevai nig southwestern wind from the
ocean is very hard to overcome, especially at
this season of the year.
The citizens of Mary.-ville evinced much in
terest in the work of the corps, William Con
lin Droviding the boys with a conveyance and
acting as guide to the summit of the Buttes.
Later in the season another attempt will be
made to break the record, possibly with differ
ent stations. J. H. W ATKINS.

MARKET REVIEW
Agents Report a Good De
mand for All Classes
of Property.
No Particular Enthusiasm Dis
played Among Either Buyer
or Seller.
The Question of Price Is the Factor
en Which Basin ss Largely De
pends Just N w.
Trade In tne real estate line continue? of
good proportions, while the situation generally
partakes of a liopeful character. Tuere is no
particular enthusiasm displayed among either
buyers or sellers, but holders still appear to
have good faith in the future, and to this
foe. ing IS attributable the increase of strength
that seems to have been imparted to values
within the past lew months. Most certainly
- some improvement in matters, because
the inquiry is more general, and there is dis
position to buy iuna oi u;l description*. The
question of prloe is :b<; factor on which busi
iio^s largely depends just now.
The tallowing is taken from the Real Estate
Circular published by Thomas Magte & Sons:
The Hibernla Bank last month lent $379,829
on City real estate, the Savings Union $127,
--â¢400 and the German Bank $141,650. Yet
alter these loans were made all oi the savings
barks had still large surpluses of unused
money on hand, for which there Is only a very
light demand lor City real estate use. No
country loans are now being made. There is
go much money on hand at some or our banks j
that a reduction of the rate < i interest Is j
likely. Existing rates are 6}^ to 7 per cout j
per annum, the banks paying the mortgage
tax. The net rate they earn is 5 tosJ^ percent.
.Borrowers, in the lace of low reals and fre
quent vacancies, cannot as a rule earn these
rales net if they borrow and build.

A two-stofy residence is to be built by Nellie
E. Scott on the east line of Shrader street, 25

A large tract of property overlooking Sutro
Heights and extending from California street
south for about four blocks, has been put on
the market, for sale by Adolpa Sutro. This
land, no doubt, will uttract liie attention of
home-seekers of medium circumstances, which
by reason of us distance from the city's cen
ter, is cheap in price, but nevertheless is one
of the prettiest sections in San Francisco lor
homes. The accent extension of the eleclric
road throughout the Richmond District has
brought the property in the outlying section
of this territory within easy and quick access
to town, and it seems quite reasonable to pre
dict that before many mouths the district in
question will be thickly settled with homes.

A Cruel Attempt to Injure
a Young Lady Yet at
School.

Apologize to Maligned

A Retnrned Traveler Reports a Great
Interest in tbe Endeavor Conven-
tion and California
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
yOrf Broadway, April 11. j
Beneath the surface of local society
there is in Oakland a continual under
current of uneasiness, caused by the
i anoi.ymous letter writer. Thia remark
does not refer to the class of anonymous
letters that nearly led up to the death
last week of a lumber company's man
ager, but to tne class who pose as legiti
mate "iociety." A few months ago the
jcouarlly method of attack was used
I against a very estimable young lady, and
j caused her considerable undeserved
I anguish with regard to the Deux Temps
j Club. Some time previous the same
method of creating unhappiness was
practiced, with a prominent financier for
the victim. Within the past two weeks,
however, an effort to hurt the feelings
and Btanding of an innocent schoolgirl
has been made, but because of the nobiliiy
of minu of all concerned, it has proved
futile.
The girl in question is attending one of
tbe most fashionable educational institu
tions in this city. Owing to one cf those
unhappy events which are co painfully
prevalent in modern society in a State
where divorce laws nre easy the young
lady is at present a ward of Mrs. PrescoU,
whose work on behalf of unhappy little
ones cannot be too highly commended.
Because of this lady's works on beliall of
all children needing more care than is ac
corded them by those responsible for
them an impression has pone forth that
there is a stigma attached to her large
family. This is cruelly false and the
young lady referred to is inferior in birth
or personal charms to none.
The anonymous letter-writer, however,
actuated by a motive worthy of a Macbia
ve;li, wrote to some of the parents ol the
pupils and tried to create trouble. The
result could not have been very satisfac
tory to the writer, for it led to inquiry
and gave a good opportunity to make
public the exact status of about fifieen
worthy young people for whom Mrs.
Prescott in her official capacity is re
sponsible.
One oi the parents written to is a man
known officially, professionally and as a
citizen all over this Stale and would ten
thousand times sooner strike down a
coward than be a {arty, however remote,
to an injury against nn innocent child,
and if he could find that letter-writer Mrs.
Prescott's wards would need no other de
lender.
The politicians have had a recount, and
it is to be hoped that they are satisfied
with the money they have thrown away.
The attempt to discover that fraud had
been committed in the interest of Mayor
Thomas was a most remarkable proceed-
ing from the very beginning. Although
some verj serious allegations were made
"on information and belief" nobody was
anxious to be known as the party who was
making the contest on behalf of Mr.
Davie. One individual did publicly
acknowledge that he had made a bijr bet
and that he would not pay it unless thoro
was a recount, but he did not pay the
expenses, and it is not at all likely that
Attorney Qeorre de Golia will proclaim
from the housetops who paid his fee.
But that is not the point of greatest in
terest at present. The experience of two
recounts held in less than two weeks has
been to prove that no fraud was com
mitted. It is a favorite cry to make in
modern politics, that corruption was re
sorted to to secure certain results. That
cry was raised two weeks ago and has
been effectively refuted and everybody
should know that politics in Oakland, so
far as an election count is concerned, is
absolutely pure. Out of nearly 10,000
votes cast for Mayor, & judicial recount
only made a difference of ten, and as
there were about thirty-four boards of
election officers, who were on duty from
twenty-four to twenty-eight hours, they
are entitled to an apology from those who
unjustly nialiened them.
Few men are more observant or broader
in their observations than theatrical man
agers, ami when they express an opinion
on current events their views are gen
erally correct. A few weeks ago Mark
Thall, the well-known Macdonough man
ager, left the East with n company trav
eling westward. After stopping at all tho
large cities of the South and Southwest he
arrived here Friday. He reports hearing
more of California than in any other
period during twenty-five years of active
theatrical life.
"I have traveled over this country for
the greater part of thirty years," said Mr.
Thall, "and I have never heard so much
interest expressed in California as I have
listened to since I left New Orleans. This
Christian Endeavor Convention that
meets in San Francisco in July is the
cause of it. Ln the hotels and the theaters
people are button-holing every Californinn
that comes along and wanting to know ali
about the State. It is really remaikable
and whenever there was a chance repor
ters would come to me and interview me
about San Francisco. They heard from
some one that I was an old-timer out here
and I had no peace.
"I think Ban Francisco will be sur
prised at the number of young peo
ple that will come here in July.
Thousands of them are not coming
out on a flying visit either, but intend
to take in the West while they are here.
You can rest assured that I told them they
would not see all California had to show
unless they visited Oakland, and I am
very glad there U to be a special Oakland
da*, because I sha'n't feel that I talked in
vain.
"i'eople should make no mistake In this
matter. It is a glorious opportunity to
teach these people something about this
State, and they are coming here willing to
be favorably impressed."

DRESSES IN SACKS,
THOUGH WEALTHY
Peculiar Discovery of a
Man With a Camera
at Pinole.
Mrs. Krieger Was Once a Belle
Who Mixed With the
Giddy Throng.
Now She Digs Clams and On'y Wears
a Dress One Day in Each
Year.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broad way, April 11. >
While seeking interesting subjects for
his camera Arthur Logan of this city
found one to-day that probably cannot be
duplicated elsewhere in the country.
About two mies this side of Pinole he
found a lady of wealth, dressed in Backs
and rope and old shoes and stockingless,
end who used to be one of the best dressed
and handsomest women in the county â
but that wa9 years ago.
Mrs. Krieger is the wife of a prosperous,
hard-working rancher. His farm consists
of about 200 acres, and the horses are
strong and the cows are sleek. The ranch
houses are all typical of a successful
farmer and tbe farming implements are
modern and in good order. Kri> ger is a
very pleasant old man, and everything
indicates happiness and contentment till
Mrs. Krieger appears.
The lady does not seem to have, any
right to be on the place. She iB very
shrewd and economical and works as bard
as her husband, but she ia no longer a
belle.
Many years ago Mm. Krieger was fond
of dress, and when told by her husband
that such tastes were not proper, she at
once went to tbe other extreme, and has
not again changed her mind. Although
her check for $20,000 would be honored,
her entire costume would not be worth 10
cents. Sbe is now sixty years of age, and
believes she is too poor to buy anything
except the plainest of food. In the house
are some beautiful silk dresses, remnants
of former fashionable wardrobes, but only
one day in the year doea Mrs. Krieger ever
indulge in the vanity of wearing one.
Only once in each year does Mrs.
Krieger leave the ranch! and that is the
occasion oi her annual business triptoÃan
Francisco. At this time sbe puts on her
Bilk dress and tine shoes. As soon as she
reaches Pinole station on the return trip
she takes off her shoes and lifts her silk
dress over her shoulders and plods home
for two miles barefooted.
Recently she went to a neighbor to bor
row somo spoons for the use of the help.
Her outfit consisted o! two old sacks, and
when working around the farm one of
these is oiten discurded. She frequently
goes to the beach to dig clams, and nobody
ever wades out further than she. Her
neighbors call ncr the "Old Indian," but
she iB a German and is very intelligent
but for the peculiar notion that she has no
money to spend for dress.
For thirty years the Kriegers have lived
on their ranch, and their only daughter is
married to a San Francisco druggist.

BERKLEY. Cal.. April 11.â The Non-
P.iriisans and the Independent Taxpayers
will be given a place on the official bal
lots at the municipal election to-morrow.
Judge Greenr decided last niaht that they
had come within tho requirements of the
law, notwithstanding the at'.emms of
Sam Fisher, a Populist, ot West Berkeley
to ke-p them off the ticket on a legal tech
nica ity. The Judge overruled the objec
tion brought ngainst them and atated that
Clerk Hanscoru had been right in printing
Iheir names on the ballots.
The Populists as a Party say they did
not .uphold Fisher in his attempt to over
throw Ihe Non-Partisans and the Tax
payers, and on Friday night passed reso
lutions denying that they were in sym
pathy with the movement instituted by
FisLer. This morning the streets were
scattered with dodgers bearing the follow
ing significant siatemeut:
The object of this circular is to present be
fore you the mean, contemptible, degraded
attempt on the part oi some parly or parti' s
to do\vn the Non-partisan af;d independent
Taxpayers' parties. Suit has been brougnt to
restrain trie names of the Non-partisans from
appearing on the ballot. The Republicans
deny all connection with the affair, as do the
Populists also, although the suit was brougnt
in the name ef the Populists by a Populist.
Now, fair-minded voter, jud^e for yourseli and
down whoever is backing this underhanded
disgracelul intrigue, as it is no other than our
enemies. Either Republicanism is swnliowed
up by Populism or Populism by Republican
ism, and they both should be boycotted and
bossism killed.
TO HELP POOR STUDENTS.
Professor Rising's Plan to Help Those
in Need.
BERKELEY. Cat*. April 11.â Professor
Wiilard B. Rising, president of the
Students' Aid Society, wants to see a
dormitory system established at the Stale
University for the benefit of the needy
collegians who are now cooking their own
meals and making their own beds.
He has called a meeting of the society
for to-morrow evening, at which he will
present a plan for a long building, to be
converted into a boarding-house or com
mons for the seventy young men who are
now doing their own housework.
He believes that if they all clubbed to
gether and employed two or three cooks
they could live almost as cheaply as at
present and would not have to suffer the
hardship of existing on two unwholesome
meals a day, as many of them at present
are doing.
There is some talk of securing several of
the university cottages which were pri
marily intended for student use, but
which have of late years been rented to
members of the university corps and
others.
According to the statistical report re
cently issued by the Aid Society a large
number of young men are living on from
$5 to $12 a month. The sixty-eight schol
arships which have recently been en
dowed will yield $125 a year each, or $12 50
a month for the college year. It is be
lieved that this amount, added to the
present income of the self-sustaining
students, will do much toward alleviating
their straitened circumstances.
CAME TO SAY FAREWELL.
Mile. Aimee Pascal Sings Only
Once at the California
Theater.
End of the Season With Ovations for
tba Artistsâ Last N.gh.t's
Farewell.
The handsome Aimee Pascal, who has
been held in reserve during tho whole opera
season, was ailowe.l Saturday night, at
the final performance of the regular
season, to make her first and, for the pres
ent at least, her last bow to a San Fran
cisco audience.
It was a very little chance that the
beauty of the troupe was given. She
played Selika in the second act of "L'Afri
caine," i> role in which the now popular
Mine. Foedor won absolutely no applause
on the opening night of the season. The
beauty had to disguise her good looks be
neath the dusky skin and hideous cos
tume of the African, but even hampered
thus people compared her to Maxlne
Elliott on account of her fine, command
ing figure, her nandsorne profile and flash
ing eyes and teeth.
Selika's music in the second act of
"L'Africaine" is of a weird and barbaric
description which appeals little to the
popular ear, though it has charms of its
own. Hannereti both by maKe-up and
score, Pascal succeeded in making a very
favorable impression. She has a full,
round, dramatic soprano voice of even
quality. A slight tendency to faulty in
tonation was probably the result of ner
vousness.
At the conclusion of the second act of
"L'Africaine" the six principals were called
repeatedly to the footlights. This was part
ly no doubt to show appreciation for Mile.
Pascal and partly as an adieu to Albers,
who had sung the role of Nelusko splen
didly, and who was appearing for the last
time.
The evening bill opened with the third
act of "La Favorita," lime. Fremeau-
Benati singing the title role. This act
gave her an opportunity of singing the
mezzo-soprano's grand aria, "O Mio Fer
nando." In the adagio movement her
voice showed signs of wear, but she sang
tne bravura movement brilliantly. Mas
sart did as good work as he has done this
season in the role of the tricked and duped
Fernando; in fact, he has never acted so

AL BAKER IS DEAD.
He Was a Familiar l'i e ure of the Â« ity'g
Karly Days
After an illness of three months, during
which time he was confined to St. Luke's
Hospital, Alfred W. Baker died there yes
terday morning.
The decease*! was a pioneer of the City,
and came here from Illinois about 1851.
He wa<Â» a son of Colonel E. D. Baker, who
was killed in the Civil War.
He was widely known here in early
days, and made hosts ol friends by his
penial manners and jovial wave. He was
a. fast friend of Thomas Maguire, the the
atrical man, and the two were frequently
seen together.
Al Baker, as he was familiarly known,
was an eccentric bachelor. He was a
little over 60 years of age when ho died,
but his friends say that up to his break
down last fall he was so energetic and so
full of life and gayety they considered
nim as young as most men of 35.
He was for thirty years a clerk in the
United States Custom-house.
Persistent dyspepsia caused the first
breakdown of his health and spirits, and
he tzratiually became unwilling to take
sutticient nourishment to sustain his
strength.
His sister, Mrs. Caroline Baker Stephens
of Seattle, has been telegraphed for, and
no funeral arrangements will be made till
her arrival.
He has one other sister, Mrs. Lucy Hop
kins, who is supposed to be in Seattle.
He left an estate in cash, and his affairs
are in charee of his friend T. W. Scott of
the Custom-house.

SUICIDE IS FUTILE.
lÂ»r. Griffiths Argues That the Self-De
stroyer Does Not Escape From
Ills.
Dr. Allen Griffiths lectured before the
Ban Francisco branch of the Theoiophical
Society at Academy of Sciences Hall last
evening. His theme was "Suicide."
"The suicide not only does not escape
from ills which flash is heir to," he said,
"but failing in that also rushes into other
Ills of which it previously knew nothing.
Heaven and hell are only states of con
sciousness, not localities, and I believe the
soul does not leave this earth when it
leaves the body. Certainly not when the
suicidal act frees it for the time from the
body. 1 '
The speaker argued that instead of capi
tal punishment, which only releases the
soul from the body to continue its evil
propensities, the prisoner should be re
strained amid such influences as to de
velop the better and depress the worse
parts of bis nature.

the last moment at Shanghai to tnice
charge of the construction of a railway for
the Government. In hi* stead came his
younger brother, Ho Vow, a bright Eng
lish-speaking man of about 27 years of
ape.
He will probably be selected to remain
here as Consul-General.
There are Â«>omo nineteen other 'digni
taries who are to be distributed in repre
sentative ollices, but it will require a few
days before they will be assigned to their
respective posts of duty.
One party 19 to leave on the next
steamer for Pt-ru. Another will leave
overland via El Paso to Mexico, while the
third will press on and divide itself be
tween Cuba and Spain.
The Chinese population was aware of
the fact that the Minister was aboard the
Gaelic, and rhen that steamer docked
hordes of Celestials blocked the avenues
ul trullic about the water front.
The representatives of the so-called Six
Companies were the first to drive into the
shed. Accompanied by Collector of the
Fort John H. Wise and D?puty Bam Rud
dell, they easily made their way to the
vessel, where they presented their re
spects.
It wan at this time that the magnificent
self-reliance of Minister Wo Ting-Fang
showed itself. Contrary to all precedent,
the Chinese Consulate of this City had
been instructed to make no arrangements
for housing t:'.e party. As a consequence,
the people from tiie different hotels were
on the gui vive to capture the choice
plum.
As they boarded the steamer the Min
ister listened to each in turn, and he re
mained non-committal until the very last
moment, when he ordered everybody to
thÂ» Occidental Hotel.
In speaking of Die matter later one of
the secretaries said that a m;Â»n named
Tom McKay, a former resident of this
City, but now a railroad man in China,
had advised the Minister on the subject
of hotels before the departure of the
Mrs. "Wu Ting-fan g> the Minis
ter's Wile.
steamer from Hongkong. Still, the Min
ister did not come to a conclusion without
first hearing the sweet stories of the vari
ous runners.
Minister VVu Ting- Fang personally at
tended to other details in regard to his
party, detain men in his exalted position
usually left to others. As a con?M|nrnce
he was besieged yesterday afternoon or a
naif score of railway people who look for
ward to and trust for tue fat plura of
transportation of the enure party out of
this City.
P. K. Gordon, passenger agent of the
Southern Pacific, took charge of the delfc
pation and will send them over as far as
Osden. From there they will go over the
Northwestern, and from Chicago it is
booked that they will travel with J. Cler
fayt of the Pennsylvania lines.
These matter- of business settled the
Minister, throuch his American secretary,
Armando Ribat, who by the way is a
Spaniard, sent a number of cipher dis
patches to Peking and Washington.
Kibas is welt known here and in the
East as the former secretary of General
Barillas, ex-President of Guatemala.
Laic in the afternoon the mpmbrrs of
the press were admitted to suite 33, where
the Minister greeted them most cordially.
He appeared to be a well preserved man
of 60 years.
Aside from his costnme and a slight
slant of the eyes there was little to de
note the Chinaman.
His En lish, although spiced with an
accent more Spanish than anything else,
was fluent and positively correct.
"So you are from The Call?" he said
inquiringly when the reporter was intro
duced. "That is a great paper, with a
large circulation. Am I not rijÂ»bt?"
He then turned to another interviewer
smiling and asked: "And you? The
Chronicle. That's good."
There was just the faintest sign of mer
riment indicated in the twinkle of his eve
and the diplomat general immediately
beeap to divide the iorcts arrayed against
him by asking:
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 12, 1897.
THE MINISTER'S WIFE.
Mrs. Wu Ting- fang, the wife of the new Chinese Minister, stood at her window all
day yesterday, end from the view thus afforded, formed her first impressions of
America and Americans.
One of the first things she remarked was, as she herself expresses it, "the lower
part of the ladies' costumes, it looks so warm and uncomfortable, and must indeed
be hard to get about in : is it not so?" On being informed that some ladles considered
their skirts to be extremely beautifying, she threw up her little hands, arched her
little eyebrows and smiled a most superior little smile. Then she looked at the
"lower part" of her own dress and settled back comfortably with a look that seemed
to say, "What queer ideas of beauty."
She received, with his Excellency, last evening some of the friends made on the
voyage over and since their arrival here. Mrs. Wu Ting-fan? cannot speak English,
so her husband interprets all she says. Being naturally pllv, everything she sees or
hears has a certain amount of fun 10 it for her, consequently there is aiways a wee
bit of a smile hiding around her red lips, ready to break into an iniectious little laugh
at the first opportunity.
"How active the American ladies are," she said in her own tongue and the Min
ister gravely reduced it to English. "And the cars that slide in the ground are so
funny. I tbink the ladies active because they get on and off tbe cars so quickly.
Would they stare at me much if I were to go out? Would I look so very odd? '
When she was told thai people wouldn't look, only perhaps a little bit when she
herseif wasn't looking, she seemed relieved, for it seenis that she is a modest and re
tiring little lady, with a decided aversion to being stared at.
Mrs. ling-fan?: is a Cantonese of high degree and rank. Her feet are surely the
very tiniest feet that have ever pressed American soil, for they are scarcely three
inches in length, and it may be added that both the Minister and his charming little
wife are extremely proud of those same tiny feet. She ha? hardly had time enough
to form any real opinion of the sights and icenes around her, but as far as she has
gone, Â«he is charmed and delighted with all they have seen.
This is the first time the Minister's wife has ever been out of China. She look^j
forward to her life in Washington, but she regrets having had to leave her native
land. The trip over was not a very pleasant one, but Captain Finch made it as agree
able as possible. She and Mrs. Finch are grent friend*, und though they are not able
to hold much conversation they seem to understand each other extremely well.
"Which paper baa the largest circula
tion?"
It was not only in this instance that the
man showed his strength. Throughout
the pleasant interview, which was chatty
as well as instructive, he forced the news
paper men to the defensive, answering
questions himself only when it suited his
purpose, but never refusing a return of
some kind, even if it was not a direct re
sponse.
"Tell mÂ« first, gentlemen,' 1 he said,
"what is the present attituue of the press
Li ChinÂ£ Hsu, Nephew of Li
Hung Chang and Son of the
ex- Viceroy of Canton, Who Is
in the Suite of His Excellency
Wo Ting-fang.
here toward the Chinese? Are we re
garded lavoraDly or otherwise?''
He listened to rather non-committal
answers and proceeded to tell how pleased
ho was to learn that the ill feeline of the
p&et had died out to a great extent.
"I hope to see the United States take a
better view of us, and I believe something
can be done in that way if we put our
heads together and talk the matter over.
"Remember, I do not want to be under
stood as saying tnat my special mission
here is to bring about that desired end. I
am here simply to be the Resident Chi
nese Minister at Washington.
"But 1 want to learn from those I meet
bow the land lies. I want to know what
is the particular 'kick' against us."
The Minister used the slang word as
cleverly as would a Bowery boy, and fre
quently during the interview he used the
vernacular, expressive if not quite proper.
"I want to have all the points gone into.
I want to know whether it is that our peo
ple are too frugal, whether they hoard
their money and send it home; cause the
wages of white men to be reduced below
the living point, or what else?
"No matter where the trouble is I be
lieve it could be adjusted in some other
way than by class legislation, which is a
bad and unjust thing.
"I believe thai the exclusion law was
enacted too hastily. With time this coun
try would have the better class of Chi
nese and would have profited by their im
migration. Instead of shutting out the
coolies you have shut us all out, the edu
cated as well as the others.
'Of cnurs , lam looking at this matter
from a Chinese standpoint. I would be
mi air if I did not also lake your siue of
he question as well.
"No doubt, you had ample reason in
your belief to act as you did, and ihdt la
why, I say, we should get our beads
together and adjust things, that tney may
be mutually beneficial.
"I talnk that tins could be brought
about, or, at least, the laws could be niod
ihed, so as 10 be beneficial io both or to
one, while not detrimental to the other."
In speaking of the existing trouble be
tween thÂ» fcani and tee Yup companies in
this City hi- Kxcellency stated:
"That is a matter I have still to look
into. The best members of the Chinese
colony were at the steamer to receive me
this morning. We did not have much
time to talk the trouble over, but I expect
to remain here a week, and I fancy I'll
have enough of it beiore I get through.
The trouble occurred, as I understand it,
from the killing of one man of the See
YupN by unknowns who are alleged to be
members ot the Sam Yupg. So far noth
ing lias developed to* substantiate the
charge. 1 trust I wiil be able to smooth
over the difficulty and get the colony on a
friendly basis."
The Minister then wanted to know how
the Americans regarded the action of tue
Chinese Consul in regard to his order to
break up the meeting-houses of the See
Yup people.
''I have two ways in which to give an
opinion on the subject," he said, when
the question was put to him. "As a Chi
nese I would say the Consul acted quite
properly. He did exactly as we do in
China. But, from a European standpoint,
I would say he did wrong. You see the
Consul is not acquainted with American
laws as I am. and he assumed a responsi
bility which has brought him into the
courts with a threatening financial liabil
ity over his head. He aHould have known
this and weighed the question of brexk up
or not break ur>, not on the Chinese basis
but on mat of the country to whose laws
he was anienablo.
"It is twenty years now since I was in
San Francisco on my way home to China.
I have not yet had time to look about me,
excepting through the window of my car
riage from the dock.
"I have not yet selected a Consul for
this City, nor have I so far selected the
people I will fend on to Peru. Mexico,
Washington and Spain. I think I will
have these details arranged in a couple of
day.
"My trip here was very pleasant except
ing for a slight contretemps in Honolulu.
"The Gaelic stopped in at Japanese
ports that ara infected, and it w*s con
sistent that we be quarantined at Hono
lulu, but the Government there promised
to be easy with us providing the health
inspection was satisfactory. In accord
ance, the Health Officer and staff boarded
our vessel miles outside and nut us
through a rigid examination. We were
declared tit to land and the ves>el waÂ«
docked.
"Imagine our surprise when we learned
then thai we were not permitted to go
ashore nor to receive visitors. Still, the
passengers from Honolulu to this City
were permitted 10 come aboard of our ves
sel from which I ihink it would have been
prudent to keep away if our Dill of health
was not clean.
"I fancy that President Dole imagined
wronjriully that I might have some treaty
to discuss with him, and as he Knows
nothing of the Chinese question he be
lieved it best to let down the quarantine
barrier between us."
INJURED BY A DERRICK.
Two Men Seriously Hurt While Work
ing on the Seawall at Goat
Inland.
Two men, B. Williams and Richard Mc-
Hugh, who were engaged in buildine the

in hoisting rock from the quarry into the
cars.
Williams was taken to the Receiving
Hospital for treatment of his right thigh,
where a piece ol the shattered timber
punctured the flesh and caused a con
tused wound, wbicn will lay him up for
some time.
His companion, McHugn, was sent to
St. Mary's Hospital, at his own request.
His injuries consist of severe spinal and
back trouble, where one of the fallen up
rights struck him.
FUNERAL OF A HERO.
Knglneer I>. H. Haubrich Burled leg-
terday.
Yesterday there was a sad scene in the
Golden Gate Park at the little cottage
down by the water works plant. The
many friends of W. H. Hauorich, chief en
gineer of the park, gathered there to ac
company his body to the Native Sons'
Hall, where the funeral services were held.
The interment took place in the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery.
The high esteem ia which the engineer
was held in li:e was raised to a climax of
love and admiration by his heroic death.
He nave up his life in the brave effort to
save the lives of others Dy stopping a run
away team.
He is highly praised for his capacity as
an engineer and for his kindness. All tiie
part people loved him and they say they
do not think he had an enemy."
He leaves a widowed mother, who was
living with him. He was bnt 29 years of
ape and the untimely ending of so useful
a life is much to be regretted. His last
act proved how worthy he was of being so
well beloved.

COURSING TALENT
IN GOOD FORM
Experienced a Phenomenal
Streak of Luck at
Ingleside.
The Outsiders Rounded To, How
ever, Late in the After
noon.
It Was a Grand Day for the Sport
and an Immense Crcwi Was
in At endance.
A grand day. backed by a good racing
card, conspired to attract a crowd of
coursing enthusiasts to the Ingleside
Park yesterday tuch as had not been seen
in' years.
The throng was so great in and about
the betting ring, and in the grand stand as
well, that it was with difficulty that the
visitors could move about. It required
the united efforts of four pool-selling con
cerns to keep up with the speculative fra
ternity, and even an additional outfit
would have found as much business as it
could have attended to.
The truth of the matter is that coursing
as it iÂ« conducted nowadays at Ingleside
is in the ascendancy. The rough element,
that came so near killing the sport not
long ago, has been eliminated, and a fair
and square game is now assured to all. It
is scarcely any wonder, then, that the at
tendance is on tiie increase and that en
thusiasm and interest are rapidly reach
ing a high altitude. The trimming down
ol the hills at tiie Ingleside park have al-o
proved to be an immense improvement,
as me spectator* can now secure an unob
structed view of the chase from any point
in the grand stand or betting nnc.
One ol the leaiur**s of yesterday's SDort
was the phenomenal success the talent m*t
with in the early part of the racing. For
a time it seemed that the wise ones were
invincible in their ability to pick winners.
True, they opened up with a blunder, but
after that they recouped with a flourish.
The first event on the card was a contest
between Grace & Dean's Hazel Glen and
Xeetian's Fair View. The sharp guessers
plunged on Fair View and lost heavily.
Certainly this augured a day's disappoint
ment, but it happened that the rule that
generally governs the Miperstitious was
erratic on this occasion, for after the first
dash the knowing iraternity picked fifteen
straight winner".
Indeed, such was their success that the
"outsiders" grew timid and in cunse
quonce heavy odds on the favorites be
came the order of the day. This was
found necessary in order to scare up any
good betting.
The game held on in this way through
out the forenoon, but in the afternoon, at
just about the time when the talent had
commenced to believe that they could not
be headed in their gallop to wealth and
fortune, there came a reversal of form
which sent some of the odds-giving
plungers out of the ring dizzy. That was
when Hazel Glen went out again, this
time to measure her speed against that of
Hooper's Beau Brummel.
Now i'.eau firummel is a celebrated East
ern crack, and those who make it a busi
ness to bet 10 win, rather than permit
themselves to be swayed by feelines of
loyalty to home talent, put nearly all of
their previous winnings on the Beau's
chances and cave big odds at that. When
ttie flag went up oignaling that Hazel had
beaien the star from the East there were
wails and lamentations among the talent,
and a proportionate exhibition of delirious
joy on the part of the victorious shon
enders. Lady Clilton, wbo was another
long shot, followed with a victory over
Susie, and aiter that the outsiders were
happy, for (he plungers' lucky string had
been Droken and betting gradually got
down to an even proposition.
In the initial trials Hazel Glen beat
Fair View, Beau Brummel beat White
Lily, Lady Clifton beat Little Tom, Susie
beat Lightning, Right Bower beat Red
Cloud, Deceiver beat Lass o' Gowrie, Sen
orita beat Cinderella, White Chief beat
Black Prince, Valley Maid beat Wattle
Bloom, Sly Boy beat Ring, Muondyne II
beat Flashlight, Move On beat Gracie S,
Sam beat Unc.e Sam, Miaimo beat Mi
mosa, Wi4l-o'-tbe-Wisp beat Speed, and
Tullermore beat Lady Blarney.
In the first ties Hazel Glen beat Beau
Brummel, L dy Clifton beat Susie, Right
Bower beat Deceiver, Senorita beat White
Cluef, Sly Boy beat Valley Maid, Moon
dyne beat Tullermore, Sam beat Move On,
and Miaimo beat Will-o'-the- Wisp.
The result of the second ties was as fol
lows: Lady Clifton beat Hazel Glen, R;ght
Bower beat Senoritn, Moondyne beat Sly
Boy, and Miaimo beat Sam.
Miaimo beat Ri ht Bower in the next
run-off and Mooudyne beat Lad.y Clifton.
As tha victorious dogs both belonged to
the Healy <fc Egan kennels thoir owners
were not compelled to rnn off the final,
having already secured first and second
money. Dillon & Keilly's Riehr Bower
took third money and M. O'Connor's
Lady Clifton took fourth.
A. C. Bradbury of St. Louis, who has
just arrived here for the purpose of
acting as trainer for W. C. Payton's ken
nels, was an interested " spectator
of yesterday's coursing. Mr. Brad
bury cor-festes that the California
climate and the California greyhounds
combine to furnish some good sport, but
he does not think the coursing men out
this way see the importance of having a
better quality of bares for the same.
"in the East they make it their business
to tram the hares as well as the dogs. 1 '
said Mr. Bradbury. "I notice that this
is not done out here. The bares should
be exercised so as to give them all the
speed possible, thus assuring the public a
high clast of sport. It is acommon thing
in the East to see the hares reach the es
capes and get away from the very best
uoirs sent after them."
Mr. Bradbury brought with him five
cra<k hounds â Pretender, La^y Pem
broke, Jester, Macric and Mystery. Thf
last three are puppies. All of these dogs
will go into Mr. Payton's kennels.
