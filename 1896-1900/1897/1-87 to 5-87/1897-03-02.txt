SENATORS SPEAK OUT.
Mprehousa Leads the Debate In
the Denunciation of the Vile
Charge of Bribery.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March I.â ln an
ticipation of tne action of the Senate rela
t:ve to the slanderous attack of tue Ex
aminer on the members of the Legislature
in charging indiscriminate bribery, the
largest audience present at the opening of
a morning session of that body was in
evidence to-day. Tbe gallery and the
lobby were well filled.
Immediately after the rollcall and
prayer, Senator Morehouse carried out the
procedure announced in The Call this
morning. Every one present Knew what >
was coming and the interest was intense j
in all that was said and done, necks being |
craned and eyes fixed on each actor in the
proceedings, which were brief, but to the
point. Senator Morehouse opened the ball
with the following prefatory remarks:
"Mr. President, just befoie adjourn
ment last Saturday I rose to a question of
privilege, and I rise to a question of privi
lege now. I had, as you all know, bat
just read the article in the Examiner
headed 'Bribery in Aid ol Thievery.'
On the spur of the moment I rose t6
my feet, and I owe to the Senate an apol
oury for some of the language which I
used at that time. It sprang from me
hastily and in the excitement of the
moment. But as to the force and purpose
a: d intent of what I said I have nothing
. to apologize for. I rise on this occasion
to again call the attention of the Senate
to that article, Will you kindly remem-
Jl*r that it is headed 'Bribery in Aid of.
!Maievery. Thousands of dollars corruptly
J>Â» i members of the Legislature to in
fluence their vote.' Observe that the head
is not that it is so rumored, that it is not
so discussed, that it is not probable, but
in most emphatic and unmistakable lan
guage it is said 'Thoas.ands of dollars cor
ruptly paid the members of the Legisla
ture to influence their votes.' " '
"Is it true that any man in this Benate
has received money as a consideration for
his vote ? If such be tire case then it is
the duty of this Senateâ it is the duty o*
every hone-t man in this Senate to know
that fact. For my part I do not believe
there is a man in this Senate who has
placed himself in that position. For near
ly two months I have had the honor ol
Bitting with the members of this Senate.
I have found them gentlemen of culture,
I have found them broad-minded, indus- '
tnous and earnest, and in my heart of
hearts I believe that every one of them
has acted honestly and uprightly, and no
mm would undertake, in my opinion, to
bribe any membs'r of this honorable Dody.
"Let me call your attention a littlo fur
ther to this article. It begins by quoting
Tennyson, 'The jingling of the guinea
heljs the hurt that honor feels,' and adds:
'There is no immediate danger that any
one here will cry out in great pain, for
then has been a deal of jingling. Some
3>od gentleman has been toiling diligcnt
at the Capitol as a dispenser of bribes.'
[s that true? Has some good gentle
an been toiling diligently in this Senate
as a dispenser of bribes? If that be true
then every man in the Senate owes it to
bimscl!, owes it to his own honor, owes it
to the people of the State thai lie should
know who this man is, who has dispensed
bnbss throughout this Capitol building.
"But let me read further on, 'Without a
shadow of a doubt members of the Absani.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
bly and members of the Senate were
bribed to support the bill.' Tliat language
is plain enough; that innguage cannot be
misunderstood. Members of the Assem
bly and members of the Senate were
.bribed to support the bill. That charge is.
i absolutely direc: and certain and- positive.
jls it true? If it be true, then we ewe it
| to the people of the State to rind out. who
! that particular Senator is, and brand him
a? he should be brandedâ unfit to" >it in
l the halls of this Senate. If itbe not true
i then we owe it to the people of California
to show that we have a Senate of men of
honorâupright and honestâ who dare to
meet issues of this kind and to declare
I that we shall not be stabbed by false as
j sertions of this character. '
"1 believe it is with, every member of
I this Senate as it is with me, for I can say
wit . Shakespeare: 'He Who steals my
purse steals trash. Twas'mine, 'tis, his,
and ha 3 been slave of thousands. But he
â¢ who rile ties from me my good name robs
; me of that which not enriches him, but
| leaves me poor, indeed.' I have had but.
one ambition and one.' purpose in life. â
: that when the hand of death touches, my
! brow I may ieave to my wife and children
; that which wiil be a ray of sunshine. to
1 them and ihat will reflect honor Opon
' them. I des.re to .so soape my public
course that when I die there will be a halo
of giory surrounding my career. X have
po doubt it is so with every' member of
this Senate. â  "
"We musr all realize that this charge is
I serious, and I say to you, gentlemen of
the Senate, it is a charge erf' such a grave
nature that we cannot let it pas's by^ â¢ We
owe it to ourselves, to the State and to the
people to prove or disprove it 1 there
fore move the adoption q.f the following
; resolution, which you will permit me to
: read instead of sending it to the desk, so
I there oan be no doubt as to its meaning."
j After reading the resolution, which was
| published in. full .in this morning's Call,
--j he continued as follows: '.
â¢T ask. the adoption of this resolution.
| I ask you to appoint a committee, and. I
ask further that, as the charge points' to
members who vo.ted for the measure, you
appoint on the. committee only members
! who voted against it. I ask further that
you call every member who. voted -for it
before this committee.
"These charges are here, and if they be
true the Examiner should receive tne sup
port of the Sen-ate in bringing to light all
the facts connected with, thtrn. If they
be false then .it should be known to the
world that you aiad I and eve"ry man who
has honestly, fairly and truly done his
duty can dare to fa.cc a newspaper that
seeks to attack Jiini.
"Let me in conclusion paraphrase from
Patrick Henry, 'Give me honor, or give
me deatu.' "
& Senator Simpson- took the floor and
spoke in favor of the- nnanimdus- adoption
of the resolution- as foHows:
."I suppose that Ido not come within
the xmrview of this article, and whichisthe
subject of the resolution which is offered.
It has been my foriune, fellow-Senators,

"There are two pidejr to this question.
We must look upon these questions from
different standpoints. It would be useless
to have a Legislature composed of forty
men in the Senate and 120 in the
whole body if we were all to view these
questions f rora ttie same standpoint. Dif
ferences will arise, but I am tired now of
having, upon occasions of this Kind
where men are honest, the papers come
out and state, without any shadow of evi
dence for it, as I believe is the case in this
instance, that the men who voted either
for or against a measure had been ap
proached, and, m -taiel in this article,
lhattney were rail for their votes. It
has been too long the custom for the
newsp.apers to jump upon the neckÂ«, if I
may use a slang phrase, of every man who
would not bow down to. theiF behest.
'I- believe with the Senator from Santa
Clara, tuatthe great body composing the
Se.nate of this State should arise to that
pomt and say .to- the newspapers : 'Prove
your- charges, or take the consequences.' "
â¢ Senator Seawell, evidently under theim
pression that the investigation was to be
â  made - the business of ttie Senate* at once,
moved that the resolution be made a
special order after the noon recess, and in
cidentally remarked that the charges were
not direct, and were, therefore, unworthy
of consideration. He lost sight of th
fact that the cowardly way in which the
covert attack had been made upon all the
legislators who voted for the Caminetti bill
was the very essence of the offense com
mitted by the. Examiner, as every such
legislator was thereby placed under sus
picion. Had .the .charges been direct,
pointing out the- men who had had their
palms oiled, the situation would have been
entirely different, and the investigation
would have asiumed other shape. As the
matter now stands, the Examiner is under
stronger suspicion of evil-doing than the
men whom it has sought to vilify. Its
chiet motive is now pretty generally under
stood to be the killing of the bill in ques
tion, not that the bill has anything in
herently vicious in its provisions, but be
cause the Monarch of the Fakers has some
ulterior object of its own.
Senator Voorheis opposed any delay in
the adoption of the iesoiution, and the
vote,- taken by ayes and noes, resulted in
its passage by a unanimous vote, thirty
four Senators going on record.
Lieutenant-Governor Jeier appointed
Senators Dickinson, Aram and Seawell as
a committee on investigation.
Seawell objected to coin? on the com
mittee, assigning as a reason the fact that
he had voted for the bill.
Morehouse requested that he be re
tained upon it, as he was known to be
"straight goods all through, a yard wide
and ail wool." â¢ Amid general laughter
Seawell expressed his acquiescence to the
wishes of the Senate; and for the time
being the matter passed out of notice, so
far as the Senate .>s concerned, routine
business being at once taken up. .
ASSEMBLYMEN AROUSED.
They Appoint a Committee to Take
â  '. Action on the "Examiner's"
. Lying Accusations.
' SACRAMENTO, Cal., March I.â The j
CLEVELAND PREPARES TO LEAVE.
Assembly took similar action to tbat
taken by the Senate to-day and appointed
a committee to investigate the sweeping
charges made by the Examiner to the
effect that Assemblymen received $150
each and Senators from $350 to $500 each.
Caminetti rose to his question of privi
lege, but to the surprise of all who heard
him he confined his remarks to the merits
of Assembly bill 273, of which Caminetti
is the author. He made an apology for
the proprietor of the two faKe papers, one
south of Market street and the other west
of the Bowery, and had no words of con
demnation, no expressions of outraged
virtue or of manly indignation for the
stain that had been put upon the honor of
himself and hia fellow- Assemblymen.
The fact that he is a politician, not a
statesman, is the only excuse that can be
urged for him. The Examiner, such as it
is, is the organ of ftis two parties â
the Democratic and the Populist. When
it fouled its own political nest and slapped
its friends in the face Carumeiti smelied
of the nest and gently rubbed the place
where the slap landed and kissed ihe feet
of New Journalist Hearst in his speech to
day. But the Examiner had supported
the man from Amador and bis political
colleagues, and it was the only. newspaper
in San Francisco, such as it is, that would
support h.im and them again when they
bob up serenely for office and for spoils.
â¢ Waymire made another flop to-day. He
was one of the icnoble turee, composed of
himself, Melick and Strain, who voted to
suppress the attempt at investigation,
â and who by that vote announced their
willingness to be silent when they or their
colleagues were publicly confronted with
the charge of being bribe-takers. Melick
voted for the final passage of the bill on
February 13. Melick and Strain voted for
the bill on February 25, when the Assem
bly concurred in the Senate amendment.
They were tnerefore among those de
nounced by the Examiner as bribe-takers
and perjured scoundrels. Waymire was
not present on either occasion, although
present at rollcall on the 25th, bnt the'
vote, as reported in the journal of that
dale, does not show his name. The vote
on both occasions was unanimous.
The final vote on February 25 was as
follows, and those are the gentlemen upon
whom the Examiner has put the charge
of being bribe-takers. It is from this in
teresting group that the Examiner must
select the names of the members whom it
has charged before the people of the
whole State with being felons: Ayes â
Messrs. Aldridge, Allen, Bridgford, Burn
bam, Caminetti, Canavan, Cartwrfcht,
Chynoweth, Clark, Cross, Cutter, Dibble,
Dryden, Elliott, Emmons, Ennis, Fore
man, Goff, Goodhue. Henry, Hill, Hud
son, Keegan, Kelly, Kenyon, Lacy. Lands
borough, Linden terser, Melick, Mulcrevy,
McCandish, McClellan, Pohlmann, Power
of Placer, Price, Rubell, Kyan, Sims,
Shanahan, Soward, Stansell, Strain, To
land, Treacy, Vosburg and Speaker
Coombsâ 46.
But though Waymire, Strain and Me
liok may be rhinoceros-hided in the face
of the terriole charge made against the
majority of the members of the Assembly,
they are the only ones who voted to evade
an investigation.
Cutter of Yuba gets off some good things
occasionally. After the apologioa for thÂ«
Examiner had been made by Caminetti,
Cutter waiked over to ihe correspond
ents' desks, and facetiously remarked that
the difference between the Examiner and
the Assembly was that when the Exam
iner made a charge against the Assembly
it couldn't prove it, but when a charge
was made against'tbe Examiner, such as
being $22,000 deep on the payroll of the
Southern Pacific Company, it was always
proved.
Caminetti emerged from behind a big
pile of law books, and rose to aquestion of
privilege. He said: â¢
"For the hrst time in my experience
as a member of a legislative body 1 feel
called upon, not on my own personal .ac
count, because I am free to say .that if no
other member of this body had been men
tioned 1 should have allowed the matter
to pass by, depending upon time, which
at least sets all things even, to justify any
action 1 may have taken.'
"The article refers to my brother mem
bers upon this Hoar, and hence on that
account I deem it necessary to take action
on this matter. I accept the responsi
bility for this bill. There is nothing in
the bill, in word or phrase that I do not
take the responsibility of, and I am right
upon this occasion. I shall have an op
portunity on another occasion before thÂ«
executive of this State to justify the bill
udoii its merits. I have not in this mat
ter imposed on the members of this
House, and I myself have not been im
posed upon, for 1 myself did not intro
duce the bill without investigation and
without a knowledge of the necessity for
it. This morning I bad the honor of sub
mitting to his Excellency the Governor
this communication :
Sacramento, March 1, 1897.'
Hon. J. H Budd, Governorâ Deak Sir: As
sembly bill 273, entitled, "An act to ameud
section 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure,"
relating to the disqualification of Judges in
certain cases, now before you for considera
tion, has been made the subject of attack in
the issues of the San Francisco Examiner for
the 27th and 28th uit.
Ordinarily, unless a request is made for in
formation, I conceive it to be not on-ly un
necessary, but "a custom more honored in the
breach than the observance" to req"uest affirm
ative action by the Executive upon a measure
that has passed both houses of the Legislature.
On this occasion, however, by reason of said
attacks, in justice to the members who voted
for the bill as well as to .myself as the au
thor thereof, I leel constrained to respectfully
request a hearing thereon on the merits of the'
changes prepared in ;he law. If not out of
place I would suggest that the Examiner be
invited to be present thereat by its attorneys.
Awaiting your convenience in. the matter and
with the hope that after such attacks the Ex
aminer will see the propriety of acceding to
the reasonable suggestion I have taken the
liberty to make, I remain, yours truly,
A. Caminetti,
"I want it to go broadcast through this
Etate," continued Caminetti, "that I am
willing to meet any gentleman that the
Examiner may appoint as its legal repre
sentative to go before the Governor and
in a calm, dignified way upon the merits
of the bill discuss it at such hearing. The
Governor said that he would give me a
hearing some time during the week, of
which he would give me notice.
"The Examiner in an article of the 27th
says that this provision is new to the law,
and that nothing like it is found in the
codes of any other American States. If
the attorneys for the Examiner will take
the same stand I shall have no doubt as to
the â  income. If their knowledge of law is
shown by that article the Governor will
not waste much time in giving them a
hearing on tnat point."
Caminetti proceeded to show that the
States of Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado,
Washington, lowa, Indiana, Kansas, Ken
tucky, Missouri, Nevada, Maine, Alabama,
Wyoming and others bad identically the
same law in operation.
'I will undertake to say, and I set it

California, have adopted tee principle be

ports which have been in circulation here
and have been cabled abroad that General
Weyler had resigned the Governorship of
Cuba because the Government at Madrid
had not consulted him concerning the re

entirely without foundation.

dispatch says that the report that General
Weyler had resigned the Governorship of
Cuba on account -of the failure of the

g&rd to the release of Julio Sanguilly is
untrue.
NEW YORK, N. V., March I.âNot
withstanding the denial from Madrid of
the story that Weyler had resigned it is
generally believed tnat if he has not
already sent in a request to be transferred
he will do so in the near future. It is
known that the release of Sanguilly was
extremely distasteful, and there is no
doubt that Weyler will at once resien tf

It is possible, too, that Weyl^r reali*ss

he does not resign. There fcsa been a
strong party in Spain opposed to Weyler's
methods and who point to the present
results as snowing them to be a failure.

In the lower court Judge Locke held
that it was insufficient under section 5283,
Revised Statutes, because it was . not al
leged "that said vessel had been fitted out â¢
with intent ihat she be employed in* the
service of a foreign Prince or State, or any â¢
colony, district or people recognized aa
such by the political power of the United
States." â¢
Chief Justice Fuller said the court â¢
agreed Judge Locke that the conten- *
tion that for seizure of the. vessel under *
section 5280 depended upon the conviction t .
of a person or persons for doing.the acts
was untenable. The suit, he said, was a â¢â¢
civil suit for the condemnation of the ves
sel only, and was not a criminal prosecu

toward both parties, but the maintei.Â«Rce

peace of one of them is disturbed, is not
neutrality in thesense , in which the word
is used when tne disturbance has acquired

nition of belligerency, and ia a mere mat
ter of municipal administration. No
nation , can permit unauthorized acts of
war within its territory in infraction ot ,
its â  sovereignty, while good â . faith toward
friendly nations requires their preven
tion. Hence,'' as the Attorney-General
pointed out, though the principal object
of the act of Congress was to secure the
performance of the duty of the United
States under the law of nations, as a
neutral nation in respect to foreign
powers, the act is nevertheless an act to
punish certain offenses against the United
States by fines, imprisonment and for
feitures, and the act itself defines the pre
cise nature of those offenses."

the words "state, colony, district or

belligerency, as shown by the instance of \ ;
the colonies of Buenos Ay res ana Fara- i2
quay, the belligerency of one having. been
recognized and the other not, while the
statute applies to both.
"lieJlsgerency," said the Chief Justice,
"is recognized when a political struggle
has attained a certain magnitude and
affects the interests of the recognizing
power, and int the instance of maritime
operations recognition may be compelled,
or the vessel of the insurgents, if molest
ing other parties, may be pursued as
pirates. But it belongs to the political
department to determine when belliger
ency shall be recognized and its action
must be accepted according to the terms
and conditions expressed. The distinc
tion between recognition and belligerency
and the recognition of a state of political
revolt between the recognition of war in a
material sense is sharply illustrated by the
case before us. For here the political de
partment has not recognized the exist
ence of a de facto belligerent power en
gaged in hostility with Spain, but had
recognized the existence of insurrec
tionary warfare prevailing at tue time
and since this forfeiture was incurred."
Quoting the different executive procla
mations on the subject the Chief Justice
continued: "We are thus judicially in
formed ol the existence of an actual con
flict of arms against the authority
of a Government with wi.ich the United
States are on terms of peace and amity
although acknowledgment of the insur
gents as belligerents by the polit:cal de
partment has not taken place, and it can
not be doubted that this executive action
has called the neutrality act into play.
We see no justification for importing into
section 5283 words which it does not con
tain and which would make its operation
depend upon the recognition of bellig-
erency, and while the libel might have
been drawn wilh somewhat greater pre
cision, we are of the orinion that it
should not have been dismissed.
'â¢The decree," said the Chief Justice,
'must be reversed and the case remanded
to the District Court for directions to re
sume custody of the vessel." .

Senor Morote declares that General
Weyler deserves the name of "butcher"

ih..t it is a shame to the Spaniards in
Cuba and to the Spanish Government to
permit the continuance of the many
crimes and barbarities that are committed
on the island. ; V= â¢*â '.='
"I am a Spaniard," said Eenor Morote,
"and I love my country; but I am also a
civilized man, and for botti reasons I la
ment the dishonor that the Spanish Gov

Spain." He added that tL.e Cubans were
being vanquished only id the lying re

"The Cubans in the field," he added,
"are not the savages described inofficial

Senor Morote spoke in terms of praise
of General Gomez, and said thtt the com

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March I.âWil
liam S. Bisbee, owner of ti.e steamer
Dauntless, says tbat the report that he
had refused to make affidavit that the
Dauntless does not intend to violate the
neutrality or navigation laws does him an
injustice. He says that he is perfectly
willing to make such affidavit, also to have
an officer remain on board the vessel in
towing and wrecking trips. The affidavit
wanted by tne Treasury Department from
Bisbee requires him to swear "that the
vessel is not to be employed either alone
or in connection with other vessels to
carry arms, ammunition or men all of the
way or part of the way to Cuba, or to be p,
party, airectly or indirectly, to the trans
portation of arms and ammunition."
He bases his retusal to sign such an
affidavit upon the decision of the United
States Court, which has declared that it is
not against tne law to carry munitions . of
war to Cuba, provided no body of \ men is
carried on tbe vessel at the time. \ â 
To-day Bi?bee applied to the Collector
of Customs for clearance papers fpr his
vessel to carry a cargo of munitions : of war
to a Cuban port. If he is refusedi clear
ance he will then enter a new stit for
heavy damages against the Collector;. He

FAKERS MUST
NOW FACE THE
CONSEQUENCES
principles of justice and founded. upon the
eternal rights of man- as denned by the
Declaration Qt â  Independence and. pro
mulgated to the world by our system of
Government as one of the principles that
make us better than all other nations.
Our Government is founded; upon the
equality 'of all citizens before the law.
"Is not that the fnct ? Can that be gain
said by anybody ? Every man is entitled
under our system of l*w tp a fair and im
partial trial before a fair and impartial
Judge. Is there any dispute- as to thai?
Iti th.3 case of penal offenses you will rind
that tae man charged with the. moat hein
ous crime known to the law, arid the- petty
criminal, that principle prevails and gives
them the same rights that we aria asking
for in this bill, iiamely, that he shall have
a fair and impartial trial, as guaranteed
under the constitution, before a fair and.
impartial Judge. . ; â¢
"While we have acknowledged that
principle; while we have accorded .to the
petty criminal that right we still deny it
to men in civil cases. . If that principle i*
correct In tne eye of the law-matters of
this.State, then it is of more importance
to protect the rights of the petty criminal
tna'n it is to place safeguards around the
poor man. As the law now stands there
is no method by which you can remove
aJudee.no matter how much prejudice
he may have against" you or how much
he may have said against' y.ota, unless he
has the decency to get ou-t of the case and
to send for another Judge to take his
place. "â¢â '... â¢ â¢ .
"It is not sufficient to tell me that you.
can appeal to the Supreme Court. for a re
dress of your wrongs, tor there ia not a
lawyer in the State that does not know
that very often things are- said and don-e
affecting the substantial rights of the
party before the court for which he. can
not gel redress on an appeal, particularly
since we have passed a law that says tbat
tlie Supreme Court shall not give weight
to a mere technical matter not vitally
affecting the rights of the appellant.
"Give the man the rigiit to present the
facts and let the Judge act upon those
facts. The Examiner has itself, in my
judgment, laid the foundation for the in
troduction of just such a measure asthis,
for it has within the past two years,
spoken of Judges of the Supreme Court
who have not done their duty, and it has
spoken of them in a way mat has weak
ened in some degree the respect due to the
judiciary.
"In fact," continued Caminetti, "so
widespread has become this lack of re
spect for the. judiciary that there now is
talk of a co.urt of disciplineâ a sort of
purgatory or reform, school in our" judicial
system. We have two State pri3onÂ» and
three refo: m school*, ana we say to young
men : 'If you act in such a way as to merit
your freedom we will give it to you; but. if
you do not we will send you to San Quen
tin. 1 Now here is a -school -that estab
lishes a court of discipline ior the Judges
even. The Examiner then felt that there
was necessity for guarding the interests
and. the rights of the' pvople in every dii
rection."
Caminetti then went on to explain, sec
tion 4of the bill, and refuted the charge
that the simple filing of the' affidavit
made it compulsory upon the Judge to
transfer the case. He Had copied very
closely the law of Wiscon-siru Thai law
made it obligatory upon the court to
transfer the case. He did not desire to do
tbat, and he had inserted the words
"whea it appears from the affidavit of
either party!" The word "appears" in
that connection has a well-defined mean
ing under 'the law and means that all the
facts must be gone into. In the State of
Wisconsin, where the law is obligatory,
tne courts have decided that it is not
obligatory to transfer the case, unless the
real facts are stated in the affidavit. The
courts -have refused to be bound by th
law where the affidavit was insufficient.'
It was not time, Caminetti argued, that
Â°-n attorney rnipht take advantage of the
unfriendly relations existing between him
self and the Judge to have his case trans
ferred from one court to another! The
bill did not apply to attorneys and covered
only the parties to the suit.
"The great objection that was raised,"
added Caminelti, "was that this law' was
made to tit. a certain case now before the
Supreme Court. I tell this Asasembly, on
my honor as a member of this lbody, that
I did not introduce this bill for the pur
pose of fitting ttiat case or any other. ,1
call upon every member on this floor to
bear out the assertion that I have not
spoken to a single man on the floor of this
house or of tne Senate, to support or vote
for" this bill-. â¢â¢ â¢
"Does it affect, as a matter of fact, the
Hale & Norcoss litigation? It could not
do so, except by a forced construction, or
by too viole-nt assumptions. I respect
Judge Hebbard as ah -honorable man, as
an able -man, as a man who merits' the
good fortune which the- people of San
Francisco have heaped upon him by their
votes: Tbe case went back to him with
nstructions to take certain testimony.
He -has taken that testimony and rendered
judgment thereon. The case has been ap
pealed to the Supreme Court.
"When the Examiner throws doubt on
the judgment of the Supreme Court it has
assumed that which it has no right to do.
The Supreme Court has passed upon every
point at issue, and there can be but very
liUle doubt as to the final outcome, be
cause part of it has been already sus
tained and there can be no doubt that the
judgment will be sustained, because they
have investigated every possible contin
gency that might arise in the matter.
"Assuming for the sake of argument
that the judgment will be set aside and
tbat tbe case will be sent back to Judge
He board for retrial, what does the Exam
iner admit by its statement and its posi
tion in this case? It necessarily admits
that Judge Hebbard is a prejudiced man,
and tbat because of his prejudice he can
not sit in judgment on the case. I say
that tbe Examiner has no right to assume
that, and t have no right to assume it.
If tbe Jud^e is prejudicedâ if the Judge is
in a position that he cannot give any
party to tbat case a fair and impartial
hearing â why not apply to him as well as
to other Judges?
"1 have no feeling in this matter, but I
do have some regard for my standing in
this body, and I have regard for every
member on this floor. I respect them all,
and' l am very sorry that any bill I nave
brought here should be made the subject
of such a discussion."
Dryden of- San Diego followed, and said:
"The name of every member of this As
sembly who voted tor tbat bill has been
sent broadcast over tbe land by im pi ca
tion as having been influenced by money."
He added that he bad favored the bill
in the Judiciury Committee because a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 2, 1897.
similar law existed in Illinois, in which
State ha had practiced law for many
years.
Then Dryden, who is a Populist, be
came flippant, and added: "I will say
that' while the Senate of the State of Cali
fornia is an honorable, dignified and wise
body,! resent with scorn the imputation
of that paper that a Senator is worth $500
and an As emblyninn only $100."
â¢ Toland said he thought mat an imputa
tion founded. upon anything shown in the
Examiner article had been cast indiscrim
inately by the Examiner against every
member of the Legislature who bad been
imt down as voting for the bill. There
was no justice in the asser.ion, and, while
he recognize! the power of a newspaper
"like that," he" demanded the respect due
to .bis personal rights as a representative
of .the people; "and if the Examiner or
anybody," he added, "can trace to any
improper motive any action that I have
taken upon that bill I demand tbat it
start upon any investigation and pursue
it to a conclusion. Illicit or illegitimate
use of p^wer I have no fear of as long as I
have the consciousness of having done
my duty as best I could, and I care not
for anybody's imputation, and I care not
what power they have to disseminate their
assertions."
McCiellan introduced the following reso
lution:
Whereas, The. Examiner on Friday, tbe 2<Jth
day of February, charguii that the members of
this House had been bribed to vote for Assem
bly bill 273,. introduced by Mr. Caminetti,
therefore be it
Reso ted, That a committee of five be ap
pointed by the Speaker to Investigate those
charges, said committee to report not- later
than Wednesday,, the 3d day of March.
Shanahan' moved the adoption of the
resolution.
-. Waymire obtained the floor and said:
"I move to.lay the resolution on the table.
I am tired of these investigations. We
have had enough of them. Nothing ever
comes of them* Let us stop this foolish
ness and go. ahead with our business."
The roll was called on the motion to lay
on the table and elicited tbe fact that
Mehck, Strain and Waymire did not want
an investigation into she charge of bribery
prelerred against every member of the
Assembly. They did not give any reason
for their strange action. Tiiere were 48
noes and 3 ayes.
Then the resolution was .unanimously
passed.
Later ia the day Keegan introduced a
resolution giving the committee on in
vestigation full power to send for persons
and. papers, to administer oaths, to
examine witnesses, and to perform all
other necessary acts for a thorough
examination of the charges made by the
fake journal. The resolution was unani
mously adopted. .
During the evening recess Speaker
Coombs appointed the following as the
committee on investigation: Belshaw of
Contra Costa, Clark of Alameda, Hill of
Humboldt, Mead of Los Angeles and Ryan
of San Francisco. Mead an I Ryan are
Democrats and the others are Republicans.
None of the committee voted for the
Caminetti bill.
The committee had a.preliminary meet
ing to-nrght in room 73 and organized by
electing Belshaw as chairman. It was
decided to ask the Assembly for a clerk, a
serjeant-at-arms and a stenographer, to
be selected from the present list of at
taches, so that no additional expense may
be incurred. The meetings will be held
in the Supreme Couri room, the first at 2
o'clock, to-morrow afternoon.
On suggestion of Belshaw it was decided
to i old all the meetings openly, the com
mittee having nothing to conceal. Tbe
first witnesses examined will be the six
Examiner correspondents, namely: "Blin
ker" Murphy, Edwin H. Clough, L. L.
Levings, Franklin Hichborn, C. H. Jes3en
and Isador Alexander. They will be in
terrogated as to what they know about
the alleged bribery. If they know noth
ing, which, "beyond tbe shadow of a
doubt," they do not, the managing editor
of the Examiner will be subpenaed and
asked whether the wholesale charge in
the Examiner has any foundation, even
in dreams. Should he decline to answer
he will be imprisoned for contempt.
He will be required to give the names of
the Assemblymen whom the Examiner in
its anonymous way charges . with being
perjured scoundrels and bribe-takers, for
a legislator who gives or receives a bribe
is a perjured scoundrel. If he cannot give
those names op the names of bis inform
ants, and it is "beyond the shadow of a
doubt" that he will be unable to do so,
tne lie and tbe fake will be crucified in
sight of the whole people as another
loathsome monument to the enterprise of
tbe "new journalism" which is making of
San Francisco and of tbe State a byword
for the tongue of scorn and derision.

Chandler's Armor-Plate Amendment
to the Naval Bi 1 F.nally
Adopted
WASHINGTON, D. C, March I.â The
Senate met at 11 o'clock this morn.ing and
immediately proceeded to the consideration
of the District of Columbia appropriation
bill. A motion to reconsider the vote by
which the sundry civil bill was passed
last night, was made by Lodge (R.) of
Massachusetts.
Some time afterward he stated his rea
son for the motion. It was that in his
absence last night, and without any notice
to him or any member of the Committee
on Immigration, an amendment had been
put in vitally affecting the subject of im
migration. He desired to have the amend
ment rejecte I, but as be had just now re
ceived tbe assurance of the chairman of
the Committee on Appropriations (Al
lison) and others that tbe amendlnep,
would be abandoned in conference be
withdrew the motion.
The House bili to authorize the sale of
forfeited smoking opium was passed with
an amendment striking out the provision
for the sale of the forfeited opium and in
serting in lieu of it tae words "shall be
destroyed."
Tbe District appropriation bill being
under consideration, it was passed with
very little friction or discussion.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire gave
notice that he would at the earliest pos
sible moment ask action on the House
amendments to the bill for an interna
tional monetary conference.
The last of the great appr6priation bills
â the general deficiency â was reported to
the Senate this morning- The Senate
committee added to it $1,892,000, being
made up principally of claims against tbe
Government. The bill now carries a totai
of $10,334,939.
The Senate at 11:50 took up the naval
appropriation bill. While the bill was
being read it was ordered, at the -sugges
tion of Mr. A lison, that at 6 ?. m. the
Senate shall take a recess until 8 p.m.
The torpedo-boats amendment and all
other amendments np to that point were
agreed to without discussion. The re
mainder of the bill having been
disposed of the controverted amendments
were taken up. The hrst question was the
provision iv the bill that the total co*t of
the armor shall not exceed $3,210,000, to
which the Senate Committee had reported
the amendment that "no contract for
armor-plate kball be n,\*de at a rate to ex
ceed $400 per ton."
Hale (R.) of Maine, in charge of the bill,
stated the reasons for the action of the
committee.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire moved
to amend the Senate amendment by
making it read: "No contract for armor
plale shall be made at an average rate to
exceed $300 per ton," and argued in sup
port of his proposition.
Replying to a question by Qnay (R.) nf
Pennsylvania, Chandler said he had no
recollection of the amendment fixing the
price at $400 being sent by the Senate
Naval Committee to the Senate Appro
priation Committee.
It was surely the conclusion, be said, of
the appropriation committee. He be
lieved that the contractors would makes
fair and reasonable profit on the armor for
the three battle-ships at $300. He under
stood that the Illinois Steel Company nad
written to t&e Secretary of tne Navy stat
ing that if a sufficiently large contract
we r e given to it it would undertake to
make the armor plate for $300 a ton.
Noticing a remark by Quay, Chandler
said that he understood the Senator from
Pennsylvania to conclude that the offer
of the Illiuois Steel Company was not
bona fide, out was for the purpose of an
noying and embarrassing the Carneeie
and Bethlehem companies. That might
be so, he said. He did not know that it
wa* so. II â  had no doubt that the ex
penditure of a million dollar? would
enable the Illinois. Steel Company or the
Cambria Company or other companies to
enter into competition lor tht* contract,
and to furnish armor plate (80,000 tons)
for not exceeding $300 a ton. He there
fore thought that his amendment ought
to be agreed to.
Gorman (D.) of Maryland said that the
cost of the armor would be five times
greater if manufactured by the Govern
ment than if the armor were made by pri
vate establishments.
Gorman advised Senators that the wise
thing to do now was to adhere to the sys
tem inaugurated in 1885, when Chandler
was at ttie head of the Navy Department.
The proposition to establish an armor
factory by ths Government would be un
wise and should be antagonized by the
Senate.
The bill was laid aside informally with
out action on the pending amendments.
Conferences were ordered on tbe Post
office appropriation Mil and on the sun
dry civil appropriation bill.
The credentials of Senator-elect Turner
of Washington and Heitfeid of laaho were
read and placed on file.
On motion of Hill (D) of New York the
Senate at 4:30 p. m. proceeded to the con
sideration of executive business, and at 6
p. m. took a reces â  until 8 o'ciock.
W lien the Senate resumed its session at
8 o'clock the naval appropriation bill was
taken up, the pending amendments being
relative to armor plate.
Ha wlcy ( R. ) of Connecticut opposed both
the establishment of an armor factory and
the fixing of the price of armor at either
$300 or $400 per ton.
Elkins (K.) of West Vireinia opposed
the expenditure of the $3,210,000 for armor
plate carried by the bill until something
definite was known of the real cost of
armor.
He inveighed against the policy of buy
ing armor without knowing anything
about its value. He advocated a suspen
sion of'the work on tne battle-ships if
necessary, for with Congress about to ad
journ, with an arbitration treaty with
Great Britain awaiting ratification, wiih
the Cuban question having the right of
way, and Julio SangUilly on his way to
the Senate to see his sympathizers, there
was no necessity for haste.
Timmins (D. ) of Kentucky said that
while he was a member of the Committee
on Naval Affairs he was unable to give
Eikins all the light he desired. But he
knew there was no expenditure "so reek
ing with fraud and so disgraceful to thosp
responsible for it" He asserted that the
two armor-making plants in the country,
the Bethlehem and Carnegie plants, in
stead of competing were in collusion to
keep up the price of arÂ«nor plate.
He went on to say that, companies got
iheir prices "because they have Irienaa in
the chamber." He spoke oi the examina
tion made into the armor furnished by
Carnegie some years ago, when it was
shoau that the blowholes were plugged
up, tue Government stamp misused and
piaies improperly tempered, and ihe Sec
retary oi ike Navy, tuiough some "hocus
pocus", fined Mr. Carnegie for lurnisblng
deiective piaies. while "our illustrious
Piesideni, wuo, Gou be prai-ea, g >es out
oi power in three days more, remitted
this fine." Rather than pay more money
to the arraor barons he would build a Gov
ernment lactory lor tbe manuiacture of
' armor, even if it cost $600 or $800 a ton,
foi then tbare would tv least be a conso
t>olation of knowing that the armor was
good and the money was distributed
among the workmen.
Quay moved to lay on the table the mo
tiou to reduce the maximum cost of armor
irom $400 io $3uo a ion, but this motion
was beaten â ayes 12, noes 36.
Chandler, in a final explanation of hi 3
amendment, said there was no such thing
as competition in u.e inanuiactur.- of tu
mor plate either in tbis country or in
.Europe and tbat the Bethieuem and Car
negie plants were members of an inter
national combine.

EXTRA SISUON OF CONGRESS.
Issuance of a Proclamation Will Be One
of President McKmley's First
Official Acts.
NEW YORK, ST. V., March I.â A Her
ald special from Washington says: One
of President McKiniey's first official acts
will be the issuance ot a proclamation call
ing tue Fifty-fifth Congress in extra ses
sion. President-elect McKinley has not
yet announced the date on which he will
coavene Congress, but it is understood by
Chairman Dineley of the House Commit
tee on Ways ana Means and others vitally
interested in knowing the date that it will
meet on March 15.
The primary purpose of the extra ses
sion is to pass the new tariff bill. In his
first message to Congress McKinley is ex
pected to devote himse.t almost exclu
sively to the condition of the treasury and
to the necessity for speedily enacting leg
islation tbat will meet the demands of the;
Government.
The general expectation among promi
nent Republicans is that the new Presi
dent will have very little to say in his
first message about monetary reform,
but he may talk of international con if r
ences.
As soon as the Committee on Ways and
â Means has been announced, and in its
Republican membership It is ejected to
be the same as the present committee.
Chairman Dinsrtey will lay the tariff bill
before it. The Democratic members will
demand time for the consideration of the
bill and tbe preparation of a minority re
port, but D.iigley -will probably restrict
them "to about a' week. Tben the bill will
be reported to the House and a special
order for iti consideration will be adopted.
It is expected that this order will allow
but two weeks for debate. Tbe House
will then pass tne bill ami send it over to
the Senate, where the troubles of the tariff
bill will begin, and it is thought it wcud be
impossible to pass it at ;t.l but for tbe fact
tbat many of tbe Democrats and Popu
lista are disposed to give tbe Republicans
every opportunity to carry out ti.eir legis
lative programme. Tbe Senate will exer
cise the full right to amend tbe bill, and
it it probable that tbis, as were tbe last
three tariff bills, will be practically made
by tbe Senate. It is th< hope of tne Re
publican leaders that tbe bill may become
a law and tbat tbe extra session will ad
journ by June.
PREACHING BY TELEPHONE.
Uf 3- Savers at Two Stations on the Mew
Jersey Shore Listen to a Long-
Di stance Sermon.
NEW YORK, N. V., March I.â The
members of the coast guard along the
New Jersey shore enjoyed a double novelty
yesterday. They attendad divine services
and that without leaving their station,
and each station heard the same sermon.
Rev. Mr. Schermer had long wished to
reach the life savers, and last week he
thought out a plan. He Knew that every
two of the life-aaving stations were con
nected by telephone and that messages
were transmitted all along the coast, be
ing repeated at every other station.
The clergyman communicated his pro
ject to Keeper Ludlam of the Stone
Harbor station, who said the idea was
feasible in a wayâ that was, the sermon
could be repeated from every other station,
but there was no way just now of making
drect connection all the way through.
The matter was explained to. the life
savers, who entered into tbe spirit of it
and agreed to send the sermon along, both
up and down tae coast.
Accordingly Mr. Schprmer and his
deÂ«cons went to Stone Harbor yesterday
and the plan was put into successful oper
ation. At the first repeating station either
wav a guard stood a: tbe telephone and
received the sermon by sentences. He
repeated what was said by Mr. Schermer
aloud to his fellow*.
One of them standing at anoth r tele
phone took up the discourse and passed
it along to the next little crowd of list
eners, and thus several hundred men heard
the preacher's woid->.
SANGUINARY RIOT AT KNOXVILLE.
Tracklayars Arrayed Against Police and
Firemen â One Mm Killed and
Many Injured.
BKNOXVILLE, Tbnn., March 1. -A ter
rible riot occurred here to-day, caused by
a conflict of authority between the United
States and city authorities about the con
trol of the streetcar franchise. Several
officers are under arrest. Arnold, a negro,
was fatally shot and Chief of the Fire De
partment Mclntosh had his skull broken.
At an early hour this morning laDorers
were put to work laying rails in the streets
for the possession of which a logai tight
bad been in progress.
Police were ordered to the *cene to stop
the work and were ordered to arrest the
labor rs, which they attempted to do, but
were assaulted by a mob of men.
Then to help the city authorities the
fire department *aa called out, and when
they arrived at tbe seat of trouble they
connected their nose witn the hydrants
and turned the water on the crowd.
The water, instead oi cooling down the
crowd, had the opposite effect, and a hot
tight ensued, in wiiiuh one man was killed
ouiright and twenty were seriously hurt,
some of whom wilt undoubtedly die.
Excitement in the ctv is intense and
further trouble ia probable. All the city
officials are now nmier arrest.

SLAIN WITH GAS

Aged L J White Murdered
by Art Ingram, a
Gambler.
Use of a Novel Weapon as a
Harpoon Cu" urinates in
Death.
Opium, Drunk^nnss, J alousy ana
Crime Lead Up to the
Trageiy.
WICHITA, Kans., March I.â Aa epi
demic of crime > as broken out in this,
city, and to-night has adaed its tragedy
to the list. L. J. White was mur lered by
Art Ingram, a local gambler and thup,
this evening, in front of the latier's home
on North Water street, in a disreputable
part of the town. .
Ingram", who is under arrest, refuses to
talk, but the. supposition is. that White
bad been in the latter's house, that they
quarreled, and that Ingrmra drove him
from the house, and, as the old man fled
in the darKness, hurled a piece ot gas-pipe
after him as one would wield a harpoon.
The gas-pipe struck White ia the back of"
the necK, took an upward course and
buried itself in his brain.
Ingram either did not know the awful
result of his aim or was too much under,
the influence of liquor to realize ii, for he
went to the police' station, told the officers
that he bad got into trouble and asked
them to attend to the injured man. The
police fouud White lying unconscious be
tween the Missouri Pacific tracks with a
long piece of gaspipe sticking in his head.
When the pipe was withdrawn the brains
oozed from the wound. The wounded
man was taken to his home, where he
died within half an hour, never having
regained consciousness.
! Insrara was locked up. His brother,
."Fiatty" Ingrain, is just out of the peni
tentiary, where he served a term for high
way robbery. A. lngram's wife is the one
who was abducted by a' gang of young
toughs over a year ago, taken to Griswold
Park, drugged â¢ and assaulted. Ingram
was one of the gang aud was forced to
marry her. One theory is that the tragedy
to-nigh; was brought on by lngram's jeal
ousy of White; White has until recently
conducted a restaurant on East Douglass
avenue. â¢He was 55 years oid, a member
of the Modern Woodmen and the Knights
of Pythias. Ingram is a molder by trade.
He is an opium fiend.
A.O FHOVJSIOX VOH.iIIZ.EA.GE.
A. DiMagreenbli- feature of the Extra
â¢easion of Congrett.
WASHINGTON, D. 0., March. L â
There is disappointment among the United
States Senators recently ejected and the
old ones who v.-iIJ be here to attend the
extra session that will be called to meet
March 15 on account of the failure of
the law to provide them with mileage.
The law stipulates that members of Con
gress shall be paid mileagu at the rate of
25 cents per mile each way at the begin
n ing of each regular session of Congress
There are but two regular sessions and
the disbursing officers have no authority
to pay mileage for any otner session.
New Senators are expecting mileage
when they appear to be sworn in on tue
4th of March for the special session of
Co.ngress, ana quite a number of the old
members who have been nere for several'
terras were under the impression that
thfiy were al6o entitled to this perquisite.
No members of the Fifiy-nfth Coneress
will be paid a dollar o! mileage until the
first Monday in December, when the regu-
Jar session convene*.

To- Day.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March I.â ln
the HonsÂ« to-day Cannon (R.) of Illinois
presented the suudry civil appropriation
bill and moved- that me Senate amend
ments be disagreed to and a conference on
the differences be requested. He said
there were some 192 of these amendments,
and if there were sufficient time he would
move to go into committee of the whole,
and give one. two, three or four days for
their discussion. The motion of Mr. Can
; non was agreed to and the bill was or
â  -dered to conference.
â¢ Senate amendment to the postoffice ap
/ r-opriation bill was disagreed to and a
* [coxi fere nee on the bill was requested.
â  Senate amendment to the bill providing
â for the sale of opium seized by the Gov
ern ment was also disagreed to and a con
ference asked.
... Senate amendment to the bill providing
/for a bridge across the Mississippi River
near St. Louis, Mo., was concurred in and
â .'; the conference report on the bill to pre
vent trespassing on National military
parks was agreed to.
A bill repealing that section of the law
..providing for sending to Washington by
-special messenger Presidential election
'certificates was passed after an explana
tion by Mercer(R.) of Nebraska that these
certificates could as well be sent by mail
or express, as the present system was
costly.
Senate joint resolution authorizing the
President to detail an army officer as
military instructor in a school of tne
Greater Republic of Central America Was
passed.
The Senate billfto extend the use of the
mails to postal-cards and envelopes owned
â¢ .â By the United States Economic Postage
Association was laid on the table.
.' Aldrich (R.) of Illinois called up the
..anti-prize-fight bill. The measure pro
vides that no picture or description of any
price-fight or encounter of pugilists under
whatever name, or any proposal or record
. of betting on the same, shall be trans
mitted in the mails of the United States 01
â by interstate commerce, whether in a
newspaper or other periodical or telegram,
or in any other form.
S<Â»ction 2 provides that "any person
..â ' sending such matter or knowingly receiv
ing such matter Tor transmission by mail
â ': or interstate commerce snotild bÂ« deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
: unisbable by imprisonment for not more
.than five years in the discretion of the
court or by a fine not exceeding $1000."
: . Aldrich, in supporting the measure,
said that atl the States of the Union save
one or two, forbid prize fights, which have
been sent to the limbo of condemned
customs with dueling, slavery^ lottenei
and polygamy.
';.- The bili, he said, simply protected the
more advanced States, which nave forbid
den pugilism as brutal and brutalizing,
against having prizefights brought into
their borders in pictures and descriptions,
which are only a little less hsrmful than
the degrading sport which they describe.
The bill did not forbid a brief statement
of the fight as a matter of news;
Congress, in its swiftest enactment, for
bade prize-fiehting in its whole jurisdic
tion, and drove a prospective fight an
nounced to occur in one of its Territories
into the mountains of Mexico, which Gov
ernment has also forbidden it. This bill
isbnt a logical extension and protection
of that act, and is in accord also with an
other act of this Congress, approved by
.. tbi- committee and since enacted into
law, prohibiting the interstate transporta
â¢ tion of obscene pictures.
Pictures of the brutality of pugilism
are hardly less harmful to our youth. Ihe
bill is in accord also with the anti-divorce
act of Congress, which has protected the
families of the whole land against the
"divorce colonies" of one of the Terri
â¢â . lories. This bill calls for immediate con
sideration for manifest reasons. It is
b-lieved the reputable press, which de
scribes prizefights only because of compe
tition, will welcome this protection. ' '
Morse (R. ) of Massachusetts advocated
the passage of the measure. He was pliei
with questions, and in reply to one he
*aiil that he hoped that the outcome of
ihe right would be that it would be tele
-1 prapned over the country that the two
I trutes had killed each other.
â¢ Grosvenoi (R.) of Ohio favored the bill,
tooie (R. ) of New York asked if it was
thought that the passage of this bill
would prohibit the printing and circula
tion of the tale ot the fight between David
and Goliah.
Dockery (D.) of. Missouri opposed prize
fiehts, but cont-iderec 1 this an extraordin
ary propositioa. It was censorship on
the press. If it was done it could be ex
tended to details of murder, and other
crimes.
Cummings (D.) of New York considered
it very dangerous ground, and said that it
could be made to prevent sending tnrough
the mails hundreds of books now in print
with pictures in them. .
Hepburn (R.) of lowa defended the
measure, holding that it would not prove
a censorship on ttie. Dress.
Quigg moved to adjourn, pending which
Dockery moved to lay the bill on the
tuble. Quigg withdrew his motion and
I'ayne moved to take a recess. Payne
withdrew that motion and the Speaker
nut the question for the third, reading of
the bill. The vote resulted: Ayea 66,:
noes 55. â  ';.' \ â .
Aldricb demanded the ayes and noes on
the question and they were ordered,
fending the rolicall Grosyenor moved to
refer the bill tothe Judiciary Committee,"
bat it was rejected.
I A motion by Mr. Cannon for a recess
Inn til to-morrow morning was agreed to.

position â the ayes and noes beine ordered

KOREA, CRETE AND CUBA.
Pertinent Questions in the British Com'
mons Replied To by Under Secre
tary Curzon.
LONDON, Eng., March I.â ln the House
of Commons to-day Sir Charles Went
worth Dilke asked the Government
whether they had any information that
the King of Korea is under the protection
of Russia; that the Korean military are
being drilled by Russian officers, and
whether, in the opinion of the Govern
ment, the action of Russia in Korea is con
sistent with the pledge given by that
power when England abandoned Port
Hamilton.
George N. Curzon, Under Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, said in reply that it was
true that some Kor an troops were being
instructed by Russian officers. The King
of Korea, he adaed, left the Russian lega
tion on February 20 and returned to the
palace. Nothing was happening, Mr. Cur
zon said, that could be regarded as being
atTariance with the guarantee given by
Russia in 1886 that she would not take
possession of any Korean territory.
Mr. Curzon made a statement to the
House in regard to the situation in Crete,
in which he said thai instructions bad
been given to the admiral commanding
the British warships in Cretan waters to
prevent as far as possible any acts of ag
gressiveness on the part of trie combatant^
in the island. In -tine with these' instruc
tions, he said, tne admirals commanding
the several squadrons had issued a procla
mation declaring their purpose to oppose
any hostile acts on the part of Greeks,
Turks or Cretans by the presence of war
ships at any point where disturbances
may occur. In regard to Seiino, Mr. Cur
zon said, the situation was critical, and
four warships had been sent to the relief
of the beleaguered garrisons and to facili
tate the departure of refugees. Mr. Cur
zon added that Colonel Vassos, com
manding the Greek army of occupation,
had promised to send an officer to induce
the insurgents to allow the departure of
the blockaded Turkish troops, and a dis
patch just received from Canea announced
that that officer bad already been sent by
the Greek commander.
Patrick O'Brien (Nationalist) asked the
Government whether they had communi
cated with the United States or any Eu
ropean power concerning the disturbed
state of Cuba and asked for information
whether the Government would use their
good offices with a view of securing the
freedom of that Island.
Mr. Curzon replied that the Govern
ment bad had no communication with
the United States or any other power con
cerning Cuba and he was not aware that
there was any intention on the part of
Great Britain to use her good offices to
bring about a settlement of the Cuban
troubles.
FIFE TIRES I* THREE MOUR8 m

NEW YORK, N. V., March I.â A re
markable series of fires, all of mystsrious
origin and all strangely similar in their
characteristics, spread terror through a.
section of the upper east side yesterday
and led to the general belief that a daring
-ncendiary was abroad, applying his
torch for no other purpose apparently
thnn the destruction of human life.
(|Five tires occurred in three hours and
ail within thp district between Sixty-fifth
and Eighty-third streets and First and
Third avenues. All were in tenement
houses and no one could tell how the
blazes started.
Four of the fires, the most important,
occuned almost within a stone't throw of
each other, in a thickly populated area,
Â« few blocks long and two blocks wide,
ana each was started in the cellar. The
clang of the fire bells and the sight of.
engines dashing hither and thither
through the streets naturally created a
panicky feeling among the tenement
house dwellers, who knew not where tne
fiend would strike next. The firemen
were exhausted by the arduous work ex
acted of them.

Cheer as They Wish
Him Godspeed.
Multitudes Choke the Streets o'
Canton Along the Line of
the Precession.
The President-E ect Makes a Touch
ing Little Speech and the
. Tra n Pulls Out.
CANTON, Ohio, March I.â Major Mc-
Kinley's home to-day strongly reminded
all of the stirring incidents preceding and
following the 3d of November. The citi
zens, together with business men, bad ar
ranged for a public demonstration to bid
farewell to their honored and beloved citi
zen and neighbor. ,
The local militia joined in the demon
stration, and at 6:30 o'clock, heaoed by
the famous Grand Army Band, marched
to the McKinley home. As they counter
marched Major McKinley, escorting the
coming tirst lady of tue land, appeared at
his frontdoor. Their appearance was the
signal for cheers, and right heartily were
they given.
As th-y walked from the famous front
porch from which the Major had deliv
ered so many speeches to the coach in
waiting there was a frantic effort to ob
tain a shake of Major McKinley's hand.
This was impossible, as the programme
admitted of not a moment's delay. Major
McKinley paused a few seconds before he
entered the cab to raise hut hat to the
thousands of people. This act was the
signal for another outburst of applause.
Major McKinley then assisted Mrs. Mc-
Kinley's maid into the cab, then followed
her. and the ride to the depot was begun.
All along the route for about a mile
the streets were jammed with peopie,
hundreds coming ironi towns adjacent to
Canton to bid the Major good-by. Cheer
after cheer was given them, and many
women cried as the President-elect's car
riage, drawn by four white horses, passed
along. Major McKinley lowered the win-
dow In the cab as he 'left the home, and
from the opening waved his hand and
Mrs. McKinley her handkerchief.
At the depot the crowd about the sta
tion was packed for squares by people
who struggled ineffectually to get
near the train, which was guarded
by the companies of militia. As the
President-elect and Mrs. McKinley
stepped upon the rear platform of their
private car, the shouts and cheers of the
people again arose. Major McKinley seated
his wife just inside the door and stepped
upon tne platform. The cheering was re
peated, but quickly subsided when the
President-elect signaled the people tp be
quiet. He addressed them as follows:
. "My nei hbora and friends and fellow
citizens: On the eve of departure to the
seat of Government, soon to assume the
duties of an arduous responsibility as
great as can devolve upon any man,
nothing could give me greater pleasure
than this farewell greetingâ thia evidence
of your friendship and sympathy, your
good will â and I am sure of the prayers of
all the people with whom I have lived so
lone- and whose confidence and esteem
are dearer to me than any other earthly
honors.
. "To all of us the future is as a sealed
book; but if I can, by official act or ad
ministration or utterance, in any degree
add to the comfort and well being of our
splendid citizenship and the prosperty of
our beloved country, I will give the bpst
and most unselfish efforts of my life.
[Loud and continuous applause and cries
of We know you will, Major. "J
"The assumption of the Chief Magistracy
is of such grave importance that partisan
ship can not blind the judgment or accept
any other considerations but for the pub
lic good of all to every par ty and every
section. With this thought uppermost in
my mind 1 reluctantly take leave of my
friends and my neighbors, cherishing in
my heart the sweetest memories and the
tenderest thoughts of" my old horne â my
homo now and I trust my home hereafter,
so lone as I live. [Tremendous applause.]
"i thank you and bid you all good-by."
[Another round of applause.]

effort to reach Major McKinley, but the
train was signaled to leave. As it moved

FRESNO, .Cal., March I.â A. H. Myers
and wife were arrested in this city by
Deputy Sheriff Timmin-s to-night for
abandoning their babe on the doorstep of
Rev. J. IJaueh's residence in Selma one
morning about two weeks ago. Myers is
an engineer on the Southern Pacific Ra:l
road, and his many friends are much sur
prised over his arrest, shortly before -the',
arrival of the southbound passenger,
train, on which it was Mrs. Myers' inten
tion to go to Los Angeles. â  : â¢
She and her husband hud about finished
packing her belongings preparatory to her
departure when the Deputy. Sheriff called,
Timmins arrested the hasbaird an.d wife
at the instance of Constable W. M. Spen
cer of Salma, who spent the day in this
city. That officer has been quietly wort
lag on the case since the morning when'
Rev. Mn.Baugh foun-d the little- one on
his front doorstep.. The babe was tucked
in among its wearing apparel inside a va
lise, through the top of which holes had
been cut to admit air. Rev. Mr. tfaugh
has a large family of his own, and he was
adverse to an increase.
Spencer stated to-night that be had con
clusive evidence against Myers and Mrs.
Myers. He gained his clew through a
woman in Selma, who bad made- the
clothing in which the babe was wrapped
when found.
The constable brought the baby to this
city with him to show it to Mrs, Myers
wren she should be arrested, tq see if her
motherly instinct would not assert itself.
His plan worked very- successfully, and
the mother received her little one gladly.
The youngster is about 4 months old,
healthy and vigorous.
Neither Myers nor his wife would make
any statement to-night. Their reason for
wanting to get rid of their child can only j
be conjectured. Mr. Myers has been j
earning a good salary on the railroad and
lives very comfortably. When arrested,
both prisoners took matters very coolly
and appeared not to be surprised at ail.
It is Delieved that they had been in
formed of the investigations conducted by
Constable. Spencer.

lution of the dilh'culty, but advises the
raising ot money and clothing at once by
subscription as well. The call abounds
with appeals to all to help the unem
ployed by attendance at and active parti
cipation in the mass-meeting.
SALE OF A RANDSBURG MINE.
Syndicate of San Francisco Capitalists
Purchases the Butte
Claim.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March. I.âAn
other big mining deal has just been nego
tiated at Randsburg. .. This is the. sale of
the Butte mine to a syndicate of San
Francisco m.-n. The consideration is
$120,000, with a first payment of $20,000.
The Butte is one ot the oldest mines in
the camp, and probably more gold has
been taken from it than from any other
mine there. Development work has been
done on nearly the entire length. The
east ana west shafts are 1300 feel apart,
and there are six otti-r shafts with a
depth of from 50 to 100 feet each. The
west-end s aft is down 150 feet, with a 20
--inch vein of rich ore on the footwall and
an 8-inch vein on the hanging wall. Thij
shaft was sunk for the first 100 feet per
pendicularly, crossing the rein, which
lies on an angle of 40 degrees. Then a
crosscut was made to reach the vein.
When the ore was struck in the crosscut
the vein was five feet in thickness.
A crew of men is at work in the upraise
at the 100 level to connect the shaft with
an air shaft some 60 feet distant, ana as
soon as thin connection is made a contract
will be let to sink the main shaft lUO feet
deeper, when a crosscut from the bottom
will strike the ore vein 400 feet from the
"â¢urface. The ore now being hoisted assays
$84 per ton, and as this is all free milling
the mill return should reach 90 per cent,
of the assay.

TAX ON NEVADA MINES.
Carson Editor. Claims ihe Norcross Bill
..Will Be petit Only a Few
â¢ Capitalists.
CARSON. Nbv.. March I.â A Carson
daily will publish the following tc-mor
row: Assembly bill 74, providing for an
extra tax on the product of mines, intro
duced by Norcross of Washoe, is one of
the smoothest jobs ever engineered in the
â¢ Nevada Legislature, although it is be
lieved that Mr. Norcross in.troduce.l it in
eood faith, without then knowing the slzs
of the grab behind il. It is nothing more
than a scheme on the part of script-dealers
in San Francisco to realize a bie profit out
of bonds in Lincoln County.
In 1873 Lincoln County issued bonds to
the extent of $180,000, Usarine 10 per cent
interest. Interact and principal now
amount to $600,000. In 1895 no interest
had been paid ami no part of the princi
pal. For ten years prior to 1893 the Com
missioners of Lincoln County failed to
levy any tax to meet, the payment on
these' bonds, and the holders Sutro &
Bros, and tue estate of Nicholas Liming,
sued the county in the United States
Court and obtained a judgment for
$600,000. â¢
The" bill will impose tax on the loading
mine in liinooin County, the De Lamar,
and it is hoped to cinch the company to
such an extent that the taxes will make
the bonds worth the amount of the judg
ment. In doing this every other produc
tive mine in the State is sacrificed.

CARSON, Net., March l^Thsi belt of
Nevada silver bullion, -emblematic of the
world's pugilistic championship, which is
to be provided for in a bill about to be m- i
troduced in the Nevada Legislature and
will be presented to the winner of the
Corbett-Fitzsimmons contest,., took the
place of nearly every otner subject in dis
â  cussioa on the streets of ' Carson to-day,
and is e'till being talked about. There is
going to be a division of- sentiment on the
propriety of allowing a measure of this
character ta be spread upon the statute
books, and, while the opposition- may not
develop enough strength to defeat the bill
in the Legislature, should a Vote be taken,
there is a probability that It may result in j
the withdrawal or pigeon-holing of the ]
document. â ,
Hon. Timotny Dempsey, the Assem
blyman who intends introducing the
measure, assures me, however, that he is 1
thoroughly in earnest, and that he is not
going to meet with defeat, lie says he
made a thorough canvass of the members
of both branches of the Legislature before j
he decided to go ahead, and found that a â 
great majority would approve of ;h,e bill.
The measure is at present being drafted
by Hon. Thomas Tennant of CaFson, one
of the brightest lawyers here, and a man
who has served six terms in the Nevada
Legislature. The title of the bill is: "An
act recognizing, the science of physical
culture ethics, aad appropriating $3000 for
Nevada's ens blemaiical testimonial to the
winner of the world's heavy-freight box
ing championship, cotn.memorati.ve of the
forthcoming contest at Carson City, March
17, 1897." â  -
The opposition no far developed to As
semblyman- Dempsey's hill comes from
the same class of citizen?â the conserva
tive and highly moral eiememâ that so
emphatically disapproved of and en
deavored to defeat the original boxing
bill which made possible the great Cor
bett-Fitzsimmons battle in Carson. After
the bill became a law they bowed in sub
mission and waited for an opportunity to
say, "I told you so." they anticipated
that the State would come in for a royal
roasting from the press and vulpit of the
world because of the alleged immorality
of its poDulation; but when they found
that they were getting off comparatively
easily, they concluded that such a terrible
crime had not been committed after all,
and began to thinking seriously of pur
chasing choice seats for the big battle:
But when it comes to talking about
doubling the seal of approval on prize
lighting in Nevada by appropriating pub
lic funds for the purchase of a champion
ship belt for the winner of the approaching
mill, these people are up fa arms again.
They declare it is going a step too far, and
they propose to see that the Dempsey
measure is defeated, if such, a thing is
within their power.
"We might just as well turn the State
into a second Monte Carlo and be done
vith it," was the way one of the opposi
tion put it to-night. "It was going far
enough to legalize the coming boxing con
tests, but to gloat over it by presenting
championship belts Will be to invite a
castigation from the rest of the woorld â
and we would richly deserve it"
tint everybody does not think this way.
As a matter of fact, if it came right down
to a vote of the people tomorrow, I
believe that not only would the boxing bill
be approved, but the Deninsey measure as
welL
Mr. Dempsey says he will introduce- his
bill to-morrow Â«r the neit day and urge
its early consideration. He feels quite
confident that it will pass.
"An* why not?* he asked, when seen
this evening. "Nevada nas come out
openly and above, board and legalized box
ing contests. She is not winking at un
lawful tights, as is nearly every other
State iq ttoe Union. You pick up any
newspap-er and glance over it and in the
dispatches you will lead of a dozen prize
fights taking place in different parts of
the United States almost every night in
the week. Yet tnese same States pretend
that they flo not tolerate boxing. Now, 1
believe that, inasmuch as we have gone
into this matter, we might just as weii do
things in style and right up to the handle.
The contest between Corbett and Pitz-
Bimmons will decide .the championship of
the world and will undoubtedly be the
greatest affair of ihe kind occurring in the
nineteenth. century. Nevada, will thereby
be the best advertised State in the Union.
. It would be no more than right, therefore,
that she should show her appreciation by
offering a small token such as the belt
suggested would be. My idea is that this
belt should be a perpetual representation
of the championshipâ that is, it should be j
held by the wir.ne? of this. battle until be
either resigns his iit!Â« or, 'is defeated by
some other asplran*. â¢ nd tnen it should
go to the new champion. I e would be
known as the 'famous Nevada belt' the
worjd over."
Governor Sadler still declines to say
whether or not he will -sign". the Dempsey
bill when it is: presented to him, pre
ferring, he saysr, to wait until he sees it
before expressing an opinion. Those who
ire close to him still insist that he favors
the project.

MR. CORBETT'S LETTER.
(INTERCEPTED.)
... â  .. CARSON, March 1,1897.
To the Journal-Examiner. (Soft Tiling): â  .
..' It is some tirtie sfncj? THE Call has managed to corral one of my
letters to you, and I feel that I. can write with greater freedom;
1 am sure that I can whip Fltzsimmons. My wife says so.
I. just learned that we have been awfully sold. You have been
writing- stories and printing pictures showing how me and Fitz were
dodging "the cameras of other papers in our wild desire to keep every
i thing for you. WeN, it turns out that instead of dodging newspaper
I artists- with cameras, we. were making fun for a lot of fly drummers
who .had painted little boxes to look like cameras and were amusing
themselves at our expense..- Next to the Legislature if s the biggest
joke, in the State. â¢â¢
I'm affaid we've been doing some raw work again. You know
we gave some money to the unemployed last week. We told all about
it in; big "headlines because the Scripture says when you give alms
sound a trumpet. 'Well, an agent came up from the office with instruc
tions to go to the unions and get them to pass- resolutions praising the
paper for its generosity. It's an old gag that worked well in San Fran
cisco, though some papers used to wonder how the unions happened to
pass such nicely worded motions and never forget to say the good thing
: for us and give the other .papers the black eye. But no one ever
'suspected us of writing the resolutions ourselves and paying some
slick-tongued. delegate to do the engineering.
â¢But I. digress. ' Our agent came up and went to a union meeting.
By and by up comes a resolution praising Mr. Hearst to the skies and
deploring the fact that the other paper owners were not so good as he.
It. would have gone through all right, for the boys were in good humor,
if a tfamp printer hadn't been there. He was all in rags and was a
miserable, half-starved looking wretch, who ought to have been turned
away.
"One moment," he says'. "Let me say something for the unem
ployed. I mean the disemployed. lam one of them. Two years ago
I was setting type for the Examiner. I was earning good wages, sup
porting a wife and children and buying a house on the installment plan.
Hearst didn't need money. He claimed to be worth $28,000,000 and
was- spending coin right and left; but one day he heard about the ma
chine that does the work of five men and before we knew where we
were the tender-hearted philanthropist had thrown fifty or sixty men
and women printers on the street and put machines in our places. The
j other paper's had to follow his enterprise â that's what he called it â or
go to the wall. So that before a year was over there were hundreds of
us out of work. That's what this. tender-hearted philanthropist did for
us. I've had ten days' work in six months. The house that was com
ing in installments went all of a heap. The wife and little ones are in
the poorhouse. That's what Mr. Hearst has done for me and mine.
He has gone to New York and is playing the hog there as he played it
here. He is making it impossible for anyone but a great millionaire to
have a newspaper. Already two journals that were giving work to
hundreds of men have been forced to the wall because they couldn't
I afford to sell their papers for less than cost as he's doing. He's found
! ing the most dangerous monopoly ever dreamed of and all the time
talking against trusts. Give us some more philanthropists like him and
the country will be full of unemployed."
The agent nearly fainted. He had' the tramp vagged late in the
night for stealing a cracker in a saloon, but our resolutions were not
passed. I've said our work is raw .and this is why it's raw: We size
up every man who has to work for his living as a darn fool and some
times we are wrong. We'd better copyright that tramp printer.
Of course the foregoing is not for publication. I send it as a loyal
member of the staff. I want to join the Press Club or the Bohemian
Club when 1 get back to town, so for heaven's sake don't let any one
know that some one is writing these letters for me.

ASSEMBLYMAN TIMOTHY DEMPSEY OF CARSON.
This Nevada legislator is the author of the bill providing for a silver belt,
studded with jewels, to be given to the winner of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight.
It is intended that the trophy shall be emblematic alike of tne championship and
of Nevada's stamp of approval upon physical culture contests with gloves.
dulged in yesterday, and in consequence
things hummed out at Cook's ranch. Bob
took a race around the neighboring hills
during the morning and stopped at the
State prison on his way home for a hot
bath. Fitzs>lmmon9 has become quite a
favorite with the prison officials, and sel
dom passes the place without stopping to
pass the time of day, or, perhaps, take
luncheon.
When he got back to the ranch to-day
he donned bis sweaters and gymnasium
togs and fought his punching-bag. Bob
goes in for this particular work as if he
were engaged in a real fight, and he
pounds the pneumatic ball unmercifully.
One of his assistants held a watch this
morning and timed the bout for regula-
tion three-minute rounds. Fitzsimmons
kept at the bag for fourteen rounds with
out showing much fatigue, and then, after
taking a turn at the wrist machine, he
challenged his trainers tv put on the
gioves. Hictey was first to accept, and
after staying with the Cornishman during
three rattling rounds cave way to Steiz
ner. This doughty lad was good for three
rounds, too, and then it was Koebers
turn. Altogether they gave the big fellow
nine hot rounds, which, with his bag
punching and other exercise, made up a
very fair morning's work.
After luncheon Bob walked into town
for bis mail and. tramped all the way back
to the ranch again for. some more boxing
and bag-thumping.
. . Bob still looks splendidly, so far as indi
cations of health and vigor go, and is as
confident as erer of victory. He seldom
misses an opportunity to tell bis visitors
how hard he intends to smash Corbett
and: with what dispatch he will put the
man with the pompadour to sleep.
Jim Corbett's heaviest work to-day was
in the boxing line. He repeated nis meth

bis bag-punching or playing handball.
Trainer Charley White insists upon this
being done, in order that the big fellow
may do his Doxine while he is perfectly
fresh and full of vigor and spring. Cor
bett agrees that this system is superior to
the one he formerly adhered to.
Corbett's workout this morning con
sisted of fifteen regulation rounds with
his trainers. He had five of them stand
ing in line ready to take their turns. He
gave each of them three rounds, begin
ning with Jeffries and ending with "Big
Jack" McVey, who made his appearance
in the gymnasium to-day for the first time
since his recent illness. Corbett boxed
fast, and while he punched his partners
bard he made no effort to drop them, as
was the case yesterday and Saturday.
The roost noticeable feature of bis per
formance was that notwithstanding the
fact tii at each one of the five sparring
partners was tired and blowing at the end
of bis respective three rounds witn the
Californian the latter finished the entire
fifteen rounds freab and strong ana ready

to the effect that be was not pleased with

to say was that Corbett impressed me as

he had grown so much bigger, and.
â¢tronger. He does not d.ance around so
much. He is, in my .opinion, a far better
man physically than he ever was and I am
that confident tnat he will whip Fiiz that-
I intend to bet a lot of money ou him."
Referee Siier has fallen victim to the
treacherous Nevada winter climate and is
indisposed. He is not seriously ill, how

ROASTS BERKELEY'S OARSMEN.
The Editor of the Stanford University
Daily Declares They Are
" Insulting,"
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 1. â College editors are at war and
all on account of the much-tallced-of
intercollegiate boatrace that Berkeley
clamors for and Stanford declares is out
of the question. The Daily Â±*alo AUo.
the Stanford student journal, hat come
out with a red-hot editorial in which the
course pursued by the members of the
University of California Boating Associa
tion is termed "insulting and unde
served." The indignation of the Stan
ford editor was particularly aioused by a
leader that reiently appeared in the
BerKeley student paper, and was copied
in the San Francisco dailies. He pub
lishes this in response:
Gentlemen of the V. C. Boating Association,
we have something to say to you.
For the phsi two years you have been trying
to force Staniord into a boatrace, and, not
content with sane arguments iti the mutter,
and not satisfied with the explanation of our
inability to make the agreement, you have
departed from the fields ot simple persuasion
and have gone out of your way to criticize us
in terms that are insulting and undeserved.
Vi v charge, us with insincerity and imply
that Stanioid would not meet Berkeley on the
water if she cou'.d. All the foundaiion iv the
case that you think you have against us Is
thiÂ«â the mere tact that Stanford talked in
1892 of entering the Columbian regatta and
made some plans In that direction, which
were speedily droppea when we discovered
how great were the disadvantages with which
we haa to deal.
We were uot "scared out," nor have we ever
seen the time when we were atraid to match
our men of muscle against Hny that Berkeley
cou.d produce. We cau play iootbali li rat rale;
and if we bad a place to tra'iii we might possi-
Dly be able to get a crew in shape to row. And
no one desires this more than we do. We re
gret exceedingly our inability to enter a crew,
and have said Â»o before.
Now then, let there be an end to th's fuss
and sputter. If the University of California
Boat Club cannot maintain its existence with
out a Stanford crew to back it up it had better
call quits and give up the ghost.
We will row when we can. We want to hear
nothing niore from you.
Talk to the galleries if you want to, but we
will hot listen.

FOOP COFFEE.
_ TWO OHIOAGO MEN,
Whose Business Gives Them Wide Ex-
perience.
There are two great grocery- stores in
Chicago wbich rank as among the largest
if not the largest in the world. Their
names are not given in print, as their
competitor would naturally protest
against such prominence. ;
- Tne names of the stores referred to will
be given by letter to any honest inquirer. â¢
'Hie manager of one of these bouses says:
"We are navins a good trade on Postum,
the health coffee made at Battle Creet,
Mich., by the Postum Cereal Company,
Limited, and our. experience that peo-
ple become steady customers when they
once try it. : '
"It is known as the genuine article of
its kind, and : certainly is a charming
beverage. I -have brewed some of the
counterfeits which are on the market,
particularly one that has .stolen part of
the name of Postum Cereal." .
"If anyone wants to know how good
Postum really is Jet him : try it alongside
of the counterfeit. The original article
has great merit or there would not ba so
many trying to imitate it." â 
A counterfeit is always. aa imitation,
and only the genuine will satisfy careful
buyers. . " Z ' :
; The manager of the other store referred
to was â  for ' nine years located among tne
coffee plantations of Java as : a buyer of
coffee for i the English army. He is rea-
sonably supposed to t>e a coffee expert.
Postum is used by his wife, children and
himself at his own home.
A reliable grocer will never offer a cheap
or weak imitation of a genuine original
article because he happens to make a lit-
tle extra profit. But it is well to observe
when genuine Postum Cereal coffee is
ordered that you get Postum and not a
spurious ' imitation - offered as "just as
g00d." â .;.:.:- â ;>;â ;'; â â¢â â ]:'â 'â .â * .-. 'â ':!â¢,'<â¢â : â¢: â â '. â .-..â¢; ;â â â

' The second week of "Shore Acres" opened at
the Baldwin Theater last night. The play was
listened to with maiked appreciation and was
much applauded.
At the Oipheiim.
Two new acts were presented at this house
last night. Waterbury Brothers and Tenny,
comedy musical artists made an emphatic
hit. From the- time the curtain went up
on their act- there was not a dull moment.
The comedy work was exceedingly funny and
the musical part of the bill far above the
average.
Dudley Prescott, the human brass band, fell
rath'-r fiat at firn, but redeemed hLmself by
Ills clever imitations of a planing-mill and
others in "the same order. The grand opera
stars introduced Signor Napoleoni. late of the
Tiveli, in the grana trio from "William Tell."
Slgnor Abramhoff sang an aria from "Faust,"
Miss Julia Cotte the page's song from "The
Huguenots" and Signor Guille the grand aria
from "L'Afrieaine.." They won their accus
tomed api>iaubo. Barney Pagan and Henri
etta Byron won a large share o( r. jiprobatiou
lor their work. Miss Byron dons five different
dresses during the act and looks pretty in
every one of them. Hayes and Lytton pre
sented "A Suent System," and- the rest ol the
bill remained unchanged.
At the Chutes.
The Chutes were closed yesterday on ac
count of the rain, but will be open every oleas

"It is no u*e for us to go off half
cocked," said Spinetti. "We' have the
analysis of thete spurious goods and the
evidence to convict, but we must now look
into the law of the cases and net accord
ingly. These people, are bound to fight
us, as thpir conviction must necessarily
take from them a very great revenue. We

Pierrots.
On all sides there are huge palm leaves,

|| PORTY HOURS DEVOTION.
- niPinn Celebration of the Feast at
St. Jgiiatius' Church.
The feast of the forty hours devotion
was inaugurated at St. Ignatius' Church
Sunday morning with solemnly anpro
priate ceremonies. The church had been
beautifully decorated with roses for the
occasion, and the great number of candles
about the altar gave the scene a stately
magnificence.
At the morning service solemn high
mass was celebrated by Father Ragio
This was followed by a procession of the
officiating priests, brothers and acolyt.es
about the church.
In the evening Father Calzia preached
to a large congregation. His subject was
â¢'The Holy Eucharist" His text was,
"Behold 1 am with you always, even unto
the consummation of the world."
"It is most consoling," he said, -'to see
the number who enter this sacred editice
on this occasion. The forty hours devo
tions is undoubtedly of great benefit to this
country.
"It has a two-fold meaning. In the first
place it is a public expression of our faith.
In the second place it is a manifertation of
our love of Christ." â¢
The speaker dwelt mainly on the first
named object of the feast. Ho argued
thai the presence ot the congreeaion was
a public manifestation of their faith in the
presence of Jesus Christ upon the altar.
The institution of the Holy Eucharist
Hadji Ephriam Benguiat, Who
Will Appear at the Ball in

was explained. This presence, the rev
erend speaker said, wai a source of com
fort and consolation to all who knelt at
the foot of the altar.
He concluded with an exhortation to
his hearers to acknowledge tneir faith be
fore angels and men.
ERA. NOT TO BE FOUND.
A Wntaonvllle Man Who Sold Real K<

C. B. Rea, who came to this City a few
days ago from Waisonville to sell some
real estate, has disappeared and his
friends are anxiously inqririne about
him. He disposed of some property, lo
cated at Colege Park, for his mother, and
received thfl purchase price, $1200 in coin.
A few days later he met a iriend on
the street and borrowed a iloilar, slating
that he wished to return home and needed
that amount to make up his lare.
He stated that he was going to buy later
a stock of rubber goods and go on tht
road as an agent. Since then he has not
been seen.
Kis friends fear that he has spent the
money received ior the sale of the prop
erty and has cither committed suicide or
left ior parts unknown. He is about 45
years ol age, of dark complexion and has
a scar on bis chin.
"CASTE" IN THE
NAME OF CHARITY
Society Belfes and Beaux
Don the Sock and
Buskin.
Children's Hospital and Armi
tage Orphanage the
Beneficiaries.
Fiowers and Applause for the Tal
ented Amateurs Who Appeared
on the Stage.
The company of society belles and
beaux who for the past month nare been
busily preparing Tom Robertson's old
comedy "Caste" Had the gratification of
appearing last evening before a large.
fnshionable and appreciative audience
that comfortably tilled the California
Theater and brought many dollars to the
coffers of both the Children's Hospital
and the Armitage Orphanage.
Like all fashionable audiences, the one
that greeted the charitable amateurs last
evening assembled late, and it wai long
past 8 o'clock before every one was seated
and Professor Stewart's orchestra
struck tne opening measures of the over
ture.
The play moved smoothly. There were
none of those distressing hitches. so com
mon to the amateur representation.
Every performer knew his or her lines,
and what is more, seemed to thoroughly
enter into the spirit of their parts. The
rather forced situations and stilted lines
of the old comedy were naturally and de.
light fully rendered, and the hackneyed
lines "True hearts are more than coronets,
and simple faith than Norman blood,"
were rendered in so charming and spon
taneous a way as to win them ready ap
plause.
"Caste" with each successive act, disclos
ing an entirely new environment relative
to social position and the attendant
money value that characterizes the various
social castes, afforded the ladies ample op
portunities for exquisite and tasty cos
mme. This opportunity they were not
slow to take advantage of, and the result
was seme very handsome gowns worn by
Miss Leila Burton, Miss Ruse Hooper and
Miss May Robeson.
A trained stock company could not have
treated the society comedy any better
than did those amateurs, many of wuom
faced the glare of the footlights for the
first time last evening.
Miss Leila Burton, in her trying role of
E.Â«ilier Ecclea, gave a most delightfully
natural rendering with much tact and
easy trace despite the many temptations
the character offers for overacting.
Miss Rose Hooper was a most bewitch
ing Polly. Dr. Frank Kobinson made a
manly and handsome D'Alroy and S^lden
Stuart gave an exceilent impersonation of
the warm-hearted though rather discern
ing Captain Hautree. Frank Norris'
make-up as Sam Gerndge was one of tne
achievements of the evening. Norris
lived, or rather acted, up to the make-np,
never for a moment forgetting the char
acter he was assuming. Eecles has always
been regarded as the star part in "Caste,"
and the way Cliarles Dickman handled it
it lost none ot its deserved prominence.
Miss May Roi>eson as the Marquise de
St. Maur and diaries Norris as Nixon
added to the general excellence of the
whole cast.
DR. MARTEN IS A CRANK.
Arrested for Sending Threaten
ing Letters to Various
Peop c.
A Srqnel to a Somewhat Unenviable
Notoriety in the Am?. Jos
selyn Case.
Dr. Arthur E. Marten, whose chief
claim to publicity lies in the unenviable
notoriety he received in connection with
the case of Miss Alma Josselyn, is a
patient in the violent ward at the Receiv
ing Hospital. He is charged with in
sanity.
The physician, since his release from
jail about two months ago, has devoted
his time principally to writing tbreaten
ling letters to officers and attorneys who
were connected with the case. Among
those who received these letters were Dis
trict Attorney Barnes, Attorney Davis
Louderback, County Clerk Curry, George
Staacke, Detective Cody and some news
paper reporters.
Yesterday morning Frank Holbrook of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, at the advice of Chief Crow
lay, swore out a warrant charging Marten
with insanity. Detective Cody found the
physician in a lodging-house at 118 Grant
avenue. His arrest was effected without
much trouble. He will be examined before
the Insanity Commissioners this morn-
ins.
Marten's escapade's in connection with
Miss Josselyn were of a dec:dedly unique
kind. The girl at the time she fell under
the physician's influence was living with
a youngrr sister with her grandfather,
George Staacke. Marten was the family
physician, and in some way he succeeded
in gettine the younger girl to make a
serious charge against her grandfather.
His next move was to induce Alma to
bring a suit for $50,000 damages against
Staacke. The notoriety succeeding these
proceedings induced General McComb,
who was then secretary of the Society ior
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, to
apply for letters of guardianship for the
younger Josselyn child. Edna, however,
managed to elude capture.
Marten then persuaded Alma to leave
the convent she was attending and make
her home with nim. The two lived to
gether as man and wife and two children
were the result. The suit Miss Josselyn
had instituted against hor grandfather for
da mu gen was ultimately dismissed much
to Marten's chagrin. His violent disposi
tion led him to threaten his common law
wife frequently, with a result that about
eight months ago he whs sentenced to jail
for six months on a charge of threatening
her life.
Since his release, Marten has shown fre
quent indications thut his mind was going.
He sent a letter to General Barnes, who
was formerly Miss Josselyn's attorney, ac
cusing him of all sorts of perfidy and
challenging him to a duel. Sheriff Whelan
was notified that the City Hall was about
to De blown up by dynamite. Chief Crowley
was called on to arrest General Barnes for
numerous horrible crimes. The other let- |
ters sent were of a similar nature.
The letters in every instance were very
lengthy, and pronounced the writer a
crank of the first degree.
Some days ago Marten placed on file in
the Count}' Clerk's office a contract of mar
riage between himself and Miss. Josselyn.
The document was entirely in the physir
cian's handwriting, even to the two signa
tures.
Miss Josselyn is now living with her I
mother at Grub Gulch, Fresno County.
Her eldest child, is living with' her. The
other is an inmate of St. Joseph's Home.

Senator-elect Platt of New York ha*
been frequently accused of being "fit for

public" in vigorous style.
Governor Pingree of Michigan cesires

In an address before the Press Club, of
Liverpool, on his -return from America,
Dr. John Watson (lan. McLaren) said:
"The press of America will tell on the
press of England in the direction o^ vi
va.eitwand the press of England will tell
and is telling on the press of America in
the direction of dignity." The phrase is.
a pretty one. but if there, has- been any
increase-in the dignity of the. American
press in recent years it hasn't been widely
noted in thin country.
THE FRIEND OF LABOR.
The Examiner, which for a long time openly opposed; the construction of the new
Federal building in this City, no longer dares to display its antagonism boldly, and
now seeks to defeat the early beginning of work by assailing Thk Call for supporting
it. The latest move of the faker has been to denounce The Call as "the enemy of
labor," and to andeayor, .thereby, to create dissensions among the people which will
so far weaken the efforts' to bring about a speedy beginningof the work of constructing
tne Federal building as will result in its postponement for a long time to come.
This trict of the Examiner is older than the Examiner itself. Willie Hearst and
his Lone Green manager are but carrying out a policy which malicious minds devised
for preventing good work almost as soon aa men began to co-operate for mutual
benefit. It is the trick of. creating dissensions among friends. The Examiner knows
that if it can get the people divided and quarreling it can silccee 1 in obstructing once
more the work on the Federal building, and perceiving that The Call is at this time
the foremost advocate and champion of that work it cunningly directs its efforts to
create among the people of the City a spirit of antagonism against Thk Call and
against those who are working with it.
It is hardly likely that these efforts of a discredited fake newspaper will be suc
cessful. The workinemen of San Francisco are intelligent. They know how to read,
they are capable of observing what goes on, and they have memories sufficiently
strong to retain a knowledge of what they have read and what they have seen. They
are aware that the truest friend of labor among newspapers is that paper which labors
most diligently to promote the upbuilding of the City and to provide work for the
workers. They know The Call has at all times beeu an earnest supporter of every
thing which tends to public harmo.riy and an earnest advocate of every measure of co
operation in the direction of -advancing the general welfare. Knowing these things,
they are not likely to be deceived either by the sne&rs or by the lies of a fake paper
which is now trying by indirection to defeat the movementfor erecting the new
Federal building in tnis City. as -effectually as it defeated the. movement before', by the
bolder methods of direct attacK.
It is an honorable ambition to be known as a friend of labor. Possibly no higher
title can be bestowed upon a man or a newspaper at this time. We are living in an
age when labor problems are the most important we have to confront, and he who at
this juncture of the world's history best serves the interests of labor will be accounted
the one who has Berved best the cause of humanity and the advancing civilization of
the world. ...-â¢'
The Call believes itself fairly entitled to be ranked among the most earnest, the
most consistent and (h-e rhpst progressive friends of labor among American news
papers. Take the present condition of affairs as an example. The Call is now striv
ing to unite the in a resolute movement to bring about .the construction of a
Federal building, which the Examiner has- long opposed. -It is urging tne beginning
and continuous prosecution of the work of erecting the ne-w municipal buildfng, and
it is:giving every aid in its power. to all undertakings of- private enterprise for the up
building of the State. The cbnstructioa. of these work's will' give employment to men
who- need it, will put money into circulation, will revive the activity of trade and will
be a benefit to all classes of people. Surely the earnest and persistent advocacy of.
measures. of this kind is ah evidence that The Call recognizes the needs of labor and
is devoting its energies {o snpplyirg- them, â¢' . . . .
In the meantime what is being done. by Willie Hearst and the Long Green man
ager of his newspaper in this City ? Hearst has turned his. back oh California and is
withdrawing a large portion .of his father's estate from this commonwealth to main
tain his sensational and disreputable journal in New York City. Long Green Law
rÂ«nce, his manager here, has abandoned the field ot legitimate journalism and con
tenting himself with getting news by fake dispatches from the Emperor of China,
Li Yune Yuen, the King of Greeccand Prince qf Coburpr, has been endeavoring to.
raise money by extorting subsidies from corporations io make up for the loss that was
sustained by the Examiner when it was cut off from the payroll of the Southern
Pacific Company. .
We need not elaborate on the contrast between the course pursued by The Call
and that which has been taken by tte Examiner. The Gall Btahds fof Pacific Coast
interests and Pacific Coast men. It seeks : to bring about in California a universal
spirit of harmony and co?operation. It seeks to unite men and not. divide them. It
is opposed to everything' which tends to dissensions. It favors everything which
inclines men to work together for a mutual benefits For these reasons it urges all
Californians to unite in a vigorous and combined effort to procure an immediate con
struction of the Federal building. '..'.'
The Call has great gratification in knowing that this movement has been cor
dially supported by the Legislature, the Mayor and Board of Supervisors, the State
Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce, Merchants' Association, Manufacturers'
Association and the Labor Council of San Francisco. With that support it can well
afford to despise the sneers and lies of t be organ of dis-ensions, malice and subsidies.
The Call claims to be the friend of labor, ami in justification of its claim points to
the record of what it has done in the past and calls attention to. what it is doing now.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
The necessity of adopting some of the
plans for building up bar merchant
marine is made very clear by the figures
on the subject collected by the president
of the National Association of Manufac
turers ana recently published in his an
nual report. .
Something over five tiroes as much of
the imports of the United States for tfao
year ending June 30, 1895, came in foreign
vessels as was brought by our own, and in
the export trade the foreien vessels car
ried eleven times as much as ours. Con
sidering the trade with Great Britain sin
gly the figures show. a contrast still more
galling to American pride. Of the import 8
from that country American vessels
brought in only $8,116,991, as against
$150,349,601 handled by foreign ships, and
of: exports carried by us there were but
$108,229,615,. while $395, 632,296 went in
alien bottoms. That is, the American
share of transporting, the British trade
was only 3.18 per cent. With France the I
proportion Was a little better, being 6.56
per cent, but with Germany it was only
one-third of 1 per cent. . . .' '
The extent of the proportionate decrease
in our merchant marine is revealed by the
fact that in 1845 American' ships carried
four-fifths Â©f our import and export traae.
The steps in the rapid decline are' shown j
thus: In 1855 American ships handled |
three-quartera of the trade; in 1860 two
thirds; in 1870 a little over one-third; in
1890 wo had dropped to an eighth, and in
1895 to little more than a tenth.
The rarity of ah Araeric m vessel enter
ing the ports of the Orient is so noticeable
that the Asiatics are said to Lave derived:
the impression therefrom that the. United
States is not a commercial nation. The
American Consul-General .at Bangkok re-,
ported that of over 500 merchant steamers
that entered Bangkok in 1894 not one was
American, and that of over 1700 vessels
entering the ports of Japan the same year
only thiity-two bore the stars and stripes.
"The record of many important ports
â¢jhowth*. utter disproportion between our
importance as a commercial nation and
the insignificance of our snipping. Two
striking examples may be singled out
from the long list. The steamers that
entered Shanghai in 1895 were: British,
1789; German, 445; Swedish and Norwe
gian, 143, and but 2 were American. At
Canton . there were entered in 1895 only
one American vessel to contrast with 1596
British steamers, and the solitary Ameri
can was only a sailing vessel.
That America should not- have made a
great advancement in the proportion-of
her foreign trade' she carried would have
been bad enough, but to go backward at
such an enormous rate is not to be su
pinely acquiesced in. . To ' expand' our'
merchant marine is something more' than
a matter of. National pride, for on many
lines of manufacture we have outgrown
the home markets, and facilities for export
ing in our own ships are growing more and
more a necessity.
The advantages that other nations
give to their shipping interests must
be met by legislation adequate to
put our people on an equality of com
petition. Careful stud-ents of this subject
differ, as to thÂ« proper method in which
this is .to be accomplished, but they
should' get together and concur in some
definite plan to recommend to Congress,
and Congress -should no longer delay in
doing something that would encourage
tbe building up of a great American
marine that would bear some reasonable
proportion to our commerce.
As New York convicts are not allowed
to work at trades tne prison authorities
are teaching them to draw and sing.
They will soon be a cultured crowd.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 2, 1897.
SENATE AMENDMENTS. â¢
The old saying, "Ttie better the day the
better the deed," has received a new illus
tration in the results of the extraordinary
session of the Senate held on Sunday. It
has been rare indeed in our history that
either house of Congress meets on that
day of the week which has been set apart
for rest; but on. this occasion, the urgency
â¢ of the situation required it and the results
accomplished jnstily it.
During the Sunday session the Senate
; materially amended the appropriation bill
in the direction of the public welfare and,
i moveover, restored to the public domain
some twenty-one million acres which Mr.
Cleveland had recently set aside as a for
est reservation. Both of these results are
for the public welfare and will tend to aid
the return to prosperity which has been
so long desired.
Among the amendments to the bill
which wil.l affect California were an appro
priation for the payment of sugar boun
ties, a clause authorizing the Secretary of
War to make contracts for tbe completion
of Oakland harbor improvements at a
cost of $680,000, ot which $20,000 is imme
diately available and $200,000 is to be con
tractedfot during the present year, and j
an appropriation of $4700 for the purchase
of fish-hatcheries at Battle Creek in order
I to propagate salmon.
indirectly California will be benefited
by the' act of the Senate in restoring to
the people the land which Mr. Cleveland
had set aside for a forest reserve. By this
act of the.Senate the people of the States
in which. the reserve was located will be
enabled to enter upon the land for the
purposes of .making homes, opening mines
and procuring timber necessary for the
varied-heeds of industry. None of the re
serves were located in California, but what
advances the welfare of Wyoming, Utah,
Colorado v Montana, Washington, Idaho
and South Dakota, in which States the
reservations weie made, will advance our
welfare, and we can rightly be pleased by
the action of the Senate in restoring the
lands to the people.
It is to be hoped the HonsewllL promptly
accept the amendments and that the bill
will be passed as adopted by the Senate.
If Mr. Cleveland chooses to vent his spite
upon the people by vetoing it let him do
bo. It will be his last chance, and an ex
tra session is coming when there will be a
new President in the White House and a
new order of things in our politics.
THE INAUGURATION.
The great event of the week will be the
inauguration of William Mr-Kinley as
President of the United States. To that
the attention of the people in all parts of
the country is now turned. It is the main
subject for conversation of all intelligent
men and occupies tbe attention of the
leaders of commerce and industry and
the workingmen generally more than any
thing else of a public nature. McKinley
is already speeding on nis way to Wash
ington, and from now until his inaugural
address has been read and studied by the
people it will be the chief theme of their
thoughts and speculations.
It is inevitable that this should be so.
We have seen many Presidents inaugu
rated heretofore, but never since the inau
guration of Lincoln has the country been
so vitally interested in a new President as
it is to-day. Mr. Cleveland, partly by the
defects of his nature, partly by the policy
of his administration and partly by the
blundering of his pnrty, has brought the
country to a condition of distress which
would not have snemed possible had it not
been accomplished. After destroying that
system of protection which promoted home
industries and revoking those treaties
of reciprocity which advanced our foreign
commerce, and in these ways injuring man
ufacturer* and trade, so that thousands of
men were thrown oat of employment, he
even refused to carry on the work which
Congress bad provided, and thus denied
to labor the small chance of earning
wages in that way.
His financial blunders were as great as
those in industry ana commerce. He
brought a great panic upon the country
and so seriously impaired public confi
dence that bankers refused to advance
money for private enterprises, and thus
the natural progress of the people was
checked and injured. As a result of all
these offenses the activities of the Nation
were stopped and the American people,
once the most prosperous in the world,
were brought for four years to a condition
hardly better than that of the working
men of the older and less resourceful na
tions.
It is natural under these circumstances
that the people should look to the inau
guration of McKinley with hope and ex
pectation. The President-elect is radi
cally different Irom the man who is to go
out of offica on Thursday. His dominant,
characteristic is not egotism, but patriot
ism. His policy is not the upbuilding of
foreign nations, but of America. He will
put our finances in good condition, he
will restore the protective tariff, he will
re-establish tne reciprocity treaties, he will
set to work on all public improvements
for which Congress has provided, he will
â¢give work to the workers, ne will build up
the country, he will hasten the coming of
a new era of prosperity, which will be
even more prosperous than the old.
It is for these reasons the people are
now awaiting with eagerness the coming
of the 4th of March. Swiftly as the days
Ily, they will pass too slowly for the im
patience of the workers who have so long
waited for a chance to earn the wages
necessary for the support of their families.
They will read with, eagerness every line
which tells how Cleveland, is packing up
to retire from office and how McKinley is
miving ever nearer to the White House.
Inauguration day ought to be made a
public holiday and a day of National re
joicing throughout the country. The
people are prepared to celebrate it as a
festival, for all hail it as the dawa of a
new era of prosperity and the close of a
Jong term of debt, deficit, depression and
disaster.

Letters From the People.
THE UNEMPLOYED.
Tht Clan tea of Mm Out nf Work mnd
tkn Cijimei.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: Just
now, while the subject of the unemployed is
so prominently before the public, it might in
terest many of your readers to loam some of
the causes that lead to so many being out of
work. The unemployed are divided Into four
overlapping classes: (1) Those engaged for a
short period who have finished their job aod
have not yet found another; (2) members of
trades which fluctuate as to the rolume of
work and yrho at a given time are unable to
get work; (3) those trades which cannot yield
a livelihood to all who compete for work in
them; (4) those who cannot get work because
they are below the standard of efficiency
either in skill or personal characteristics. As
to the direct causes of non-employment, they
may be thus summarized: (1) Seasons
fluctuations, particularly In the building
trades; (2) yearly fluctuations dependent ou
seasonal changes; (3) regular fluctuations
such as those caused by imports and harvest
ing cessation; (4) fluctuations caused by
Changes of fashion; (5) fluctuations caused by
the shiiting of seats ul industry; (G) changes
of process of manufacture, such as the dis
placement of hand by machine labor; (7) gen
eral changes causedby the general depression
in trade. A consideration of these heods will
show cause for the acute distress that exists in
our midst tc-aay. Very respectfully,
\Y. L. BUGLER, 12G Ellis street.

WANTS Hl^ RECiRD TO SPEAK.
Some of Lyman J. Gage's Chicago friends
Intimated to him the other day that they
would like to give him a public dinner before
he went to Washington, "you must excuse
me." was his reply. "I want no demonstra
tion in my honor now. If, after four years of
service as a member of the Cabinet, my neigh
bors think I have served my country so faith
fully that they desire to show their apprecia
tion, v dinner would be all right. I prefer,
however, to enter my country's service with
out heralding. Let my record in office speak
for me."
THE BOULEVARD
READY AT LAST
Work May Begin Upon a
a Part of It This
Morning.
The Spring Valley Deed for the
Extension Has Been
Filed.
The Work of the Relief Committee
of the Unemployed Keeps
Growing.
The situation of the big army of the un
employed at the barracks on Howard
street was not materially changed yeater
day except by an accession to their ranks.
The "commissary department," with the
donations secured yesterday, was fairly
well provided for. The coal supply, which,
was entirely exhausted the night before,
insomuch that the cook was embarrassed,
was yesterday replenished by a donation
of a full ton of the black diamonds from a
dealer in them.
The wapon was out yesterday on two cx
i pedilions and each time returned with a
! number of bags and boxes of needfuls.
I Several bundles of clothes' were received.
The relief committee, composed of five
1 in em hers of the organization, have, a busy
| and distressing time of it during their
j every afternoon sitting. To them is re
ported all the cases of distress of married
I men or families that apply for relief, but
who do not. live or take their meals at the
! barrack?. Many of these cases are pitiful
j in the extreme. â  The committee holds its
sessions in a small room at the head of
the 3tairway leading from the street. The
j room is unlighted save, by a small oil
lamp. Around a table sits the committee
and hears the applicants one by one. The
applicant is required to state his or her
circumstance-, and if they are physically
able are required to pledge themselves to
do their iÂ«hare toward collecting the pro
visions upon which they wish to draw. If
they decline to do this they are turned
away with empty bands. This is often a
j sticking point,- and the applicants rather
than take hold of the rape of the wegon
goes away hungry. *
' Chairman of the committee .and vice
president of the organization, Charles A.
Davis is chief inquisitor. -He explains to
tne applicant that, "to be plain, the men
here have begged these goods. You wilt
at once see that yon are asking them to
share with you the supplies that they
| have gone out upon the streets and begged.
Of course, it is humiliating to have to bep,
ana these men here da not like the task
any more than do. other people. .You will
| see, therefore,, that it is not fair to ask:
them to beg for yon. Now, if you expect
to get a share of the goods you will have
! to share in the work of collecting it; you
i will have to take hold of therope with the
[rest of the boy.s-. "\V ii 1 you doit?"
Of course this speech is .modified and I
varied according to the physical condition- j
of the applicant. If it is an old man, or j
a person in any way disabled, they are |
asked as to their, willingness to as-ist in
any way they can; to ride on the wagon,
| for instance. In almost every case the |
I utmost willingness ia expressed, though
| sometimes with a deal of swallowing of
I that something that rises in the throat of
sensitive people in facing such conditions.
In a few-instances the conditions were top
i much and the applicants .went, their way
! unassisted. Sometimes the applicant is
! set. to work at something about the bar
i racks, such as sweeping down the stairs.
j Indeed, the stairs were swept again and
i again yesterday in this way, for in every
case, where the persons were able, some
work was exacted of them. .
No less ihan forty-two applications
j were heard and relief granted. Where
' acy doubt existed concerning the truth of
I the tales of woe that were' told they were
I investigated by men atppoi.nted for the
! purpose. Among ail the others there was
one particularly painful case yesterday.
An old man and old woman, man and
wife, who live together in a little cabin
beyond the Five-mile House, walked all
the way in to : the barracks yesterday to
I ask for aid. When they arrived they were
| so exhausted as to be almost unable to
tell their story. The old woman, being
asked if she was hungry., answered "No"
and began to cry. They were taken up
stairs, however, and food placed before
them, and they ate as though half
famished. They were giren some sup
plies and then asked how tbey intended
to. get back hoiqe and they replied that
they would have to walk. They were
I civen carfare after the c/ld man .had
| "done his turn" at work about the place.
I A committee, headed by President.
Leffingwell, visited the V,. M. C. A,
rooms yesterday with the expectation of
stating the case before the Monday Club
of Ministers, but they did not know tha
. hours of meeting and were too late.
Mrs. Sheppard, an old- lady living at
2928. Lombard 'street, gave to the relief
committee $10 in gold to be used for the
. relief; of destitute families^ .'-â 
Following is a list 6f. contributions se
cured yesterday by the wagon men:
Three sacks potatoes, ltiO pounds fresh meat,
3 sacks flour, butter, box macaroni, 25 Dounds
rolled oats. 75 pounds corn meal, 60 loaves
bread, half barrel corned beef, 2 bottles wine

fruit, 2 cans fish, bucket apple butter, 10
pounds tea, dozen saucers, dozen plates dozen
cups, 3 coffee-pots, 2 lots clothes, pair shoes 6
cans milk, ton of coal.
The executive committee have made
arrangements for the publication of "Hard
Times," which will contain official ao
nouncenients together with a complete
Jiat of articles and the names of thoae who
have 8O generously donated them from
time to time. The committee states that
while the daily press has been very lib
eral in giving space it cannot Jbe expected
to publish every deta-il which the commit
tee feels should be given to the public.
Tie paper will be publjsned- on butcher
paper and sold â  from door to door by the
registered unemployed only. It will make
its appearance early next week.
The Spring Valley Water Company has
prepared the form of- a deed giving a strip
100 feet wide for the extension of Seven-tn
avenue and :his was presented to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. Adolpn
Sutro telephoned that he would have the

CRACKAJACKS OF THE ROAD RACE
Sunday's great bicycle handicap over the San Luandro triangle was the principal theme of conversation among the
members of cycling clubs yesterday in their various meeting places.
The wonderfully fast time made by Delmas over a rough country road was praised by all, while the others who made
good time and won prizes were not forgotten.
Special praise was given to the great efforts made by Bozio, Davidson, Delmas, Wing, Griffiths and Smith for their
wonderful performance froru start to finish. Bozio, however, came in for extra praise because of his hard-foueht battle for
the place prize, for which Davidson gave him such a close call. In the race Davidson, who was unacquainted with the road
and set the pace for those who started with him, had undoubtedly the hardest task before him. Leaving his bunch,
with one grand spurt he darted ahead and overtook the bunch ahead of himâ the only one between him and the tapeâcarry
ing with him Bozio, who wen the first prize for place. His work showed him to be a first-clafs rider. DeJmas, who is rec
ognized as one of the most prominent wheelmen of the amateur class, and who succeeded in making the fastest time,
hardly did as much as those who knew him had anticipated.
Griffiths, because of his well-known generalship in calculating time and distances, had been backed as a possible
winner, and his finally leading the bunch of fast riders after a hard contest showed his superiority over his competitors.

Mrs. Magdelina Wittemeier was sen

for contempt of court until she consents to
comply with an order to pay $500 to At

The money was found to be duo on ac
count of services performed by the lawyer
in the estate of J. G. Wittemeier, deceased,
of which Mrs. Wittemeier is executrix.
Mr. Hughes wanted his money and the
executrix refused to pay, although the
court had adjudged it to be due.
Attorney M. OL Hassett made an argu
ment before Judge Coffey urging that
there were other legal complications that
diu'lit to be taken into consideration, but
Attorney Benjamin contended that the
lady's defiance of the court's order was
not based on a bona-lide difference of
opinion.
This view was accepted by Judge Coffey
and Mrs. Wit.iemeier was remanded to the
custody of the Sheriff, but subsequently
released on her own recognizance until

time for appealing to the Supreme Court

MRS. STANFORD WILL
PAY THE TAXES
At Least That Is Judge
Hebbard's Decision in
the Case.
Settling the Question of Assess
ment for Personal
Property.
Stocks Owned in California and De
posited E sewherj Held Subj ct
to Revenue Laws.
Judge Hebbard has decided the case of
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, executrix of the
will of the late Senator Leland Stanford,
against the City and County of San Fran
cisco, in which the interest of the City is
at stake to the extent of about half a
million dollars a year. The amount in-
volved in this action is only $10,344 45, but
if Mrs. Stanford should win her case in the
Supreme Court the City treasury would
be deprived of something like |500,000
annually in taxes on personal property
owned by the Stanford estate, the Fair
estate and other estates of similar mag
nitude.
Ail the corporation lawyers of the State,
and they are numerous, powerful, intelli
gent and resourceful, will join forces to
defeat and overturn this decision.
Plaintiff brings this action to recover the
sum of $10,344 45 taxes, assessed against
personal property of the estate of Leland
Stanford, deceased, for the fiscal year
1894-95. which >urn plaintiff paid under
protest. The personal property consists
of stocks and bonds of foreign corpora
tions not doing business in this State,
some of the certificates of which were on
the tax day in the possession of plaintiff
in San Francisco, and some were neither
in San Francisco on the day of the death
of Leland Stanford, nor on the tax day,
nor since, but were and are held outside
of the State of California as collateral
security ior the payment of loans.
The issue presented to the court is upon
the demurrer of defendant that the com
plaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
As against the demurrer plaintiff con
tends that to tax the stocks and bonds of
foreign corporations the tangible property
of which is and is taxed outside of this
State, would be double taxation under
section 3608 of the Political Code, enacted
March 7, 1881, whether the certificates of
the same were or were not in California
on the first Monday in March, 1894. In
iiis decision Judge Hebbard says:
The caso of San Francisco vs. Fry, 63 Cal.,
470, determines absolutely this question. In
that casÂ«. Mrhich our Supreme Court decided in
Jane, 1883, it was distinctly held that shares
of stock in a corporation, the tangible property
of which is situated in another State and sub
ject to taxation under the laws thereof, such
snares being owned by a resident of this State,
are taxable here without regard to the taxes
imposed upon the corporate property; that the
inhibition against double taxation only ap
plies to such uixution by the same State or
Government. a Ââ_
To the same effect arc the cases, San Fran
cisco vs. Flood, 64 Cal. 504, ana Mackay et al.
vs. San Francisco, 45 Pac. Rep. 690. In this
latter case plaintiffs were executors and sued
on behalf of the estate of Theresa Fair, de
ceased, to recover taxes paid under protest
upon bonds of a corporation organized in
Arizona, payable in New York and mortgaged
in Arizona, and our Supreme Court held, July
22, 1896, that said bonds could be taxed In
California as the property of a permanent
resident of California, and that such taxation
was not in contravention of the fourteenth
amendment of the Federal constitution which
guarantees to all persons the equal protection
of the laws. , ,
Under the ruling in these cases the general
contonlion of plaintiff cannot be sustained.
The next contention of plaintiff in support
of her complaint 18 that as to the stocks and
bonds situate outside ot the State, not having
been sen t out of the jurisdiction with the in
tent to evade taxation here, they are not
assessable against her for the reason that the
sunie have a situs outside of the State oi Cali
fornia and have never at any time been in her
].o-.--es*lon or under her dominion or control.
Plaintiff is a resident and citizen of Caliior
nia, and Leland Stanford was a resident and
citizen of California at the time of his death.
In the case of San Francisco vs. Mackay, 4
West Coast Reporter, 407. decided in Novem
ber, 1884, Sawyer, Circuit Judge, held, con
cerning the situs of stock of a California cor
poration, owned by a resident of Nevada :
"The situs of incorporeal, intangible, per
sonal property lor purposes of taxation is that
of the residence of the owner when living out
side ol the State as well as when living within
It. * * * There is no definition, so Jar
as J am aware, in the constitution or statutes
of California declaring what shall constitute
the situs of such property (shares of stock) for
the purpose of taxation or otherwise; and, in
the absence of such definition, we must be
governed by the general and well established
rules of law on tho subject, and that Is that it
follows the person of tue owner."
This case and many others sustain the legal
fiction n.at certificates of shares of stock! and
bonds are wherever the owner is.
Ihe remaluuer of plaintiff's argument is to
the effect that she cannoi be taxed upon the
stocks and bonds pledged in New Yorit as col
lateral security for loans, because not bein^ in
her actual possession she is not chargeable
witn them as executrix, and that being
pledged they are not taxable.
An executor is chargeable with property
which was pledged by his decedent, as well as
with property in the hands of third parties, to
which decedent had good title at his death.
See 7, Am. and Eng. Ency. Law, p. 242-247
--255. C. C. P., Sec. 1443.
The pledging of the property gave the
Dledgee no title to it.or to any part of It. The
pledgee has merely a lien upon it, and tne
title to it is still in the pledgor.
Shares of stock which have been pledged as
collateral are taxable in the piedgor's name.
See "Waltham Bank vs. Waltham, 10 Met.
(Mbfs. ) 334; Tucker vs. Aiken, 7 N. H.,113;
Kattennun vs. Ingalls, 28 N. E. Rep. (Ohio)
168.
Under the constitution and laws of this
State certain deductions are allowed for debt,
for the purpose of fixing assessment valua
tions. Article XIII, section 1, ot the constitu
tion, provides for a reduction from solvent
credits, of debts due toboua fide residents of
this State, and the same provision is re
enactod in subdivision 8 of section 3629, Polit
ical Code, but this favor Is not extended to
debts of citizens o! this State due to citizens of
other States.
Not following the initiative of a great
many ermine- wearers in recent days,
Judg:* Hebbard pauses at this point with
sufficient respect for the constitutionally
recognized lawmakers to say:
If this rule be harsh in its application to the
facts and circumstances of sued a case as the
one before the court, the amelioration thereof
must come irom ihe Legislature, and cannot
come at first instance from the courts.
After reviewing all the law that had
been read in favor of Mrs. Stanford's
claim the decree of the court was as
follows:
The demurrer must be sustained, and as It Is
apparent that plaintiff cannot successfully
amend, the action is dismissed.
Assistant City Attorney Rhodes Borden,
who had charge of this phase of the City's
litigation, expressed gratification over toe
result. He said: "I think Judge Heb
bard's decision is good law, and I don't
see how the attorneys for the other side
will be able to meet his logic when the
matter goes to the Supreme Court. So
far as I can see the position taken by
Judge Hebbard is unassailable and I can
conceive of no contingency by which the
City can be defeated In this controversy.
The State constitution and the provisions
of the codes appear to be conclusive. It
is a signal victory for the people of the
City and the State and I cannot foresee
any chance for overturning this decision
in the Supreme Court."

Excitement That Attended
Last Evening's Tug
of-War.
Sam Pinkerton Smashed Her*

and Mouth.
The Well-Knowa Anchorman Was
Accused of Having So d Oat
His Team.
An exceedingly large crowd of the lov
ers of athletic sport witnessed the second i
evening of the international tug-of-war
tournament at the Pavilion, and as the
contests were spirited the spectators left
the Pavilion pleased with the results.
It was almost 9 o'clock when the Irish
team put in an appearance.
The team was a strong favorite in (he
belting, selling at $10, as against $3 on the
Danes.
Considerable money went into the pool
box, as it was rumored that the Danes
couid not possibly lose.
The tue was short and spirited. The
Irish were first to declare war, and putting
their best endeavors into the struggle,
they yanked the rope so hard that the
indicator took a lively plnnge along the
stick for several inches, then it stopped
short never to go over to Ireland again.
Tha Danes, with one mighty effort,
pulled big Robert Smith, the anchorman,
off his seat and then the jig was up with
the Irish lads. The indicator traveled
with a rush over to Denmark and as it
struck the winning post the judge pressed
the trigger of his little gun and every
body but the losers who wagered on the
Irish team cheered for Denmark. .
The second event of the evening was a
meeting of the Canadian and German
teams. The betting was $10 to $6 in favor
of the Cnnucks.
At 9:10 o'clock the Judge again pressed
the trigger of his little gun and they were
off. The Canadians cut out a great pace
and sent the dial down the stretch so fast
that the Germans could do nothing. The
Canadians won the pull in exactly 17 sec
onds.
The Swedes, who were strong favorites
in the betting, came upon the platform
looking confident. Their opponents were
the Norwegians.
The Norwegians made a good start and
gained three cleats before the Swedes
checked their progress.
Tbe indicator remained stationary for
some little time, as the Swedes were tak
ing matters easy. In the meantime the
poolseller was busy taking in the money
that was wagered by the friends of either
aide.
At a sipnal from their captain the
Swedes made a gallant effort to win back
lost ground, and the struggle was exciting.
The dial slowly moved along the stick
untii it reached its original position, and
there it stopped short. The Swedes, after
a short rest, made another attempt to
gain an advantage, but their opponents
were equal to the tusk, and held them
well in hand. The next attempt
the Swedes proved their superiority

Their opponents were the Frenchmen,

Sam Pinkerton of the Scotch team
leaped like an enraeed tigr r from his posi

man AtKinson, who received a couple of'
good stiff punches in the face.
Excitement was now at fever hoat. Po
licemen ran to the rescue of Atkinson,
and they had their hands-full in the en
deavor to subdue' the inTuriateu Pinker
ton, who was full of singer and light.
The last-named athlete accused Atkin
son of having sold the team out to some
gamblers, and he was backed up in his
opinion by other members of the team.
After the battle was over and the pullers
retired to their dressing-rooms there was
loud talking and threats among the con
testants until some of- the belligerents
were escorted by the officers â  from the
building. As. the pull Was in progress the
betting grew stronger in favor of the
Frenchmen.
The announcer reported just as the next
contest was about to take place that the
referee had investigated the cause of the
disturbance, and found that it was only a
misunderstanding between Atkinson and
Pinkerton.
The last contest was* between the United

TWO WERE TO
BE BEHEADED
How the Chinese Govern
ment Bunishes Rebel
lious Subjects.
Startling Developments of the
Case Against the Chinse
Consul.
Relatives of See Yup Merchants Said
to Have Been imprisoned in
China.
Some startling testimony, showing the
manner in which the Chinese Govern
ment deals with its rebellious subjects In
foreign lands, came to light in United
States Commissioner Heacock's Court yes
terday, in the case of the See Yup Society
against the Chinese Consul.
Fong Yuen Hing is being sued by the
See Yups for $5000 damages, ior having
employed Captain Cailundaa to break up
their headquarters.
Attorney Campbell, who represents the
See Yup Society, stated that he intended
to prove that the Chinese Minister at
Washington, through the information he
received from Fong Yuen Hing, had or
dered seventeen See Y*up_ merchants to re
turn to China for punishment for their
opposition to the Sam Yups.
Two were to be beheaded and the rest
imprisoned for life. On their refusal to go
back to the fate in store for them orders
were sent to their homes in China to have
tneir relatives imprisoned until they sur
rendered.
"We can prove," said Mr. Campbell,
"that the father of one of tbese mer
chants, an old and decrepit man, is taken
out of the prison twice a week and beaten
shamefully to force his son to return. We
have copies ot the indictments against
these men found by a Chinese court and
charging them with high treason."
The Consul denied that he had threat
ened the seventeen See Yups or tlieir
families with punishment if they did not
comply with the order to return, and
stated that he knew of no such orders.
He admitted, however, that at the order
of the Chinese Minister at Washington,
he had told the See Yups here that 1; they
did not close the boycott on the Sam Yups
they would be punished.
Jong Yuen Hing gave the See Yups a
very bad name, saying that in view of the
fact that the twelve highbinder societies
were identified with the See Yup Society,
that organization must be considered bad
all the way through. The Consul said
that the See Yups had made an agree
ment with the Chinese Minister some
time between January 14 and February 12,
1896, not to allow any more shooting in
Chinatown. They were io disband if the
pledge was not kept.
Mr. Campbell's line of questioning was
intended to show that the Consul was
against the See Yups and in favor of the
Sam Yup 9, and that the Minister had
acted on Fong Yuen Hing's reports.
This line of examination was blocked
by Attorney Garter, who appeared for the
Consul, by advising his client not to an
swer.
The Consul took advantage of tbe ad
vice and refused to answer ail questions
relating to the correspondence between
himself anc? the Minister.
Fong Yuen Hing was attended by two
body guards while on the way to and
from the court, and the precaution was
apparently well takon, for among the
horde of Chinese who crowded Jud^e
Hcacock's court until they were driven
out were several well-known bighbinders
who are known to belong to societies
affiliated with the See Yup?. Their low
ering looks followed the Consul at all
times, and tney listened closely to the
statements of the Consul and the ques-
Uions of Interpreter Harry Huff.

HEAVY LOSS BY FIRE.
The California Crockery Company It
.Damaged to the Kxteut of
Nearly 810,000
A destructive lire caused about $10,000
damage in the establishment of the Cali
fornia Crockery Company at 212 California
street yesterday morning. Smoke was
seen issuing from the basement of
the store and an alarm was turned in
at once, but the fire had gained such head
way that the fighters of the destructive
element had a hard time sabduing the
flames.
By the time the blaze was under con
trot the heavy streams of water had
broken a large amount of crockery, and
damage by fire and the tearing up of floors
did the rest.
A. Marx, the proprietor, says that the
loss is fully covered by insurance.

WON HIS SUIT
AND DIED HAPPY
Millionaire Qnackenbush
Passes Peacefully
Away.
His Sole Heir Is Said to Be
His Daughter, Mrs.
Swortfiguer.
Tne Funeral Will Take Place To-
Morrow Afternoon From St.
Stephen's Church.
Thomas M. Quackenbush, the aged mil
lionaire, whose life has of late been matter
of public interest in connection with the
Nancy Abbott suit, a led early yesterday
morning at his residence, Â«li WeoÃter
street.
The immediate cause of i>is decease was
heart failure, but there is no doubt that
his end was hastened by the trouble and
anxiety due to the protracted lawsuit
against Mrs. Abbott, which was decided
in his favor shortly before his death.
Quackenbush had reason to iear that
Mr.-. Abbott, with whom he had lived for
some time as a boarder, would step in
after his death and claim the whole or a
part of his large fortune on the strength
of a spurious marriage contract, some in
timation of which he had privately re
ceived, lie therefore took the initiative
and carried the matter into tne courts,
with the object of preventing posthumous
litigation which might threaten the peace,
quiet and prospecis of his daughter and
sole heir, Mrs. Sworttiguer.
The defendant in the case fought hard
to establish her claim to be the wife ol
Quackenbush, but the testimony of ex
perts conclusively satisfied ihe court that
the alleged marriage contract was a
forgery, and a verdict was returned ac
cordingly.
Tne possibility of the case being ap
pealed did liotseem to disturb the con
t-ntment of the millionaire's last nio
mems, and there is no doubt ihat his
determined action in the matter will help
to simplify the subject-matter of any sub
sequent inquiry.
At the bedsiue at the time of his death
were his daughter and son-in-law, Mrs.
and Mr. B\vortnguer.
The decease I was a native of Schenec
tady, N. V., and came to this City in le^O.
He amazed a fortune as a contractor and
builder, and in later years retired from
active business. The funeral will take
place to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock
irom St. Stephen's Church on Fulton
street, Rev. E. J. Lyon officiating.
1 he will of the deceased and all other
matters of a legal character are in the
hands of his attorneys, E. J. Pringle and
W. W. Foote. The only surviving rela
tives other than nis daughter and son-'.n
aw are two nieces, who reside in tho East.
WOODMEN IN COUNCIL.
A Log- Rolling and Smoker by
Members of Golden
Gate Camp.
Golden Gate Camp No. 64, Woodmen of
the World, he!d an enthusiastic log-roU
im and smoker in the banquet-hall of the
Native Sons' building last evening, which
was attended by nearly 500 persons.
This was in honor of a visit to the camp
from Head Consul Falkenber? of Denver,
who has been in tbis State for several
weeks on a tour of official visitations to
the 9Â»veral camps.
A good programme had been prepared
under the supervision of the following
named committee of arrangements: Dr.
J. Â«J. Bainbridge, chairman; J. P. Farreli,
W. M. Hinds, G. W. Lunt and T. P. San
ford, and was successfully carried out un
der the direction of M. T. Moses, past
consul of the camp.
When the head of the order entered the
hall in company with I. 1. Boak, head
manager for the State of California, the
audience rose and sans; "The Woodman's
Chorus" to the air of â¢'Marching Through
Georgia," and kept it up until the distin
guished yisitor took his seat on the plat
form.
Percy T., Clayton C. ana Albert J. Bon
yer and George Meuser, the Woodmen's
quartet, favored the audience with songs,
alter which the head consul delivered a
very interesting address on Woodcraft.
He closed by announcing that the Head
Camp will hold its session In tbis City in
the year 189 S. He expressed the hope
that Golden Gate Camp, which has now
539 members, will before that time have
increased its membership to t he extent of
making it the banner camp.
The address was followed by a recita
tion by H. B.Jennings; a barytone solo
by Mr. Hinas; ventriloquism by J. H.
Greefkuns; comicalities by Kelly and Mar
lowe, and a song by J. Hanson. Tho sev
eral nuinlers formed a very pleasant en
tertainment, which was highly appreci
ated by all present.
WHY THEY BEEAK DOWN.
Not Only Animals, bnt Menâ A Strong
Object. Lossim.
"lie was a splendid racer once, bnt Is all
broken down now," was the remark of a
gentleman who saw a well-known horse
bobble by. The horse has been overtaxed
and "brolce down." The man of business
strains his energies and breaks down.
ThÂ» wife, mother or workingwoman goes
beyond her strenKth and breaks down.
Th<> world seems rilled with broken-down
people, and unfortunately, It generally
seems to be their own fault. When nature
begins to give way assi.it her. Do it sen
tly, and do it sensibly. Stimulate her
weakening powers with pure whiskey
taken as a medicine ana no! as a beverajre.
Nine times out of ten, the breaking down
will cease and health will return.
It is necessary, however, that only pure
and medicinal whiskey be used, and doc
tors all agree that Duffy's Jure Malt
Whiskey is the only Diire and reliable
preparation it) America. It has tne in
dorsement or clergymen, owing to its
great medicinal qualities. It is n- ed in
hospitals in cases of fever, and where a re-,
liable stimulant is required, Dut it ts great
power is in restoring the broken aewn,
building up the weak and debilitated,' and
giving uew life to the aged. Do not ner
m't any dealer to sell you a worthless
article, claiming it as stood as Duffy's,
which is the only medicinal whiskey be
fore the public.

A. A. Watkins, the president oX the
Board of Trade of Sah Francisco,;. has
issued calls for the meeting of Thursday,
and he says he expects a large attendance.
The subject of the new Postoffice is now
a popular topic of', discussion around
town, and the action of The .Call in
creating the agitation in this worthy
cause is most favorably commented upon..
SIX LARGE BODIES.
The Builders' Exchange Will .Join
in the Big Joint. Mass-Meeting.
The Builders' Exchange ha-s taken Up
the Postofiice building agitation in a man
ner that shows the members propose to do
ail in their power to have the work begun
as speedily alls possible. It frequently hap
pens that when there is any large move
ment on foot different bodies are inclined
to be more or less jealous al each other,
and some annoyance is caused by each ac-
Blring to-be in the lead-. â¢ _ ' "
Not so with the. Builders' Exchange.
Acting upon tbe principle that the greatest
good can be done by the united- action of
a large body, the. exchange has joined
hands with the rive large commercial and
industrial bodies in a joint mass-meeting,,
to be held in tbe chamber of Commerce
j ooms next Thursday afternoon at 1
I- clock. This decision was made yester
day. . ."..â â¢:.'
' In response (o a call issued by the
president, Oscar Lewis, the board of di
rectors of tbe Builders' Exchange met at
their rooms, at 40 New 'Montgomery street,
at 1 o'clock, and representatives of all kinds
of builders, carpenters, plasterers, brick
layers, painters and iron- men, were
present. â¢â , .
President Lewis stated that he had been
absent from the City recently and upod
his return was directed by The Call and
the leading commercial bodies of the City
to a movement that iias for its object the
early commencement of the new San
Francisco Postoffice buiidin?.
.. "We should not be behindhand or in
different to-this proposition," said he. "It
is of gr:-at importance to the contractors,
material men and the laboring classes.
All of these will certainly draw more or
less benefit from having the work begun
and carried to completion and particularly
I at this time when times are decidedly
I 'dull in the buildup line. We should, as
a body, do all in our power to have tne au
thorities at Washington set the ball in
motion. In presenting our wishes and
matins; our requests we should be sure
that we are not misunderstood. Our pur
pose is not to find fault with what has
been done or what has not been done. It
will be of no use to go back over the old
grounds and raise questions as to the pur
chase of the lot upon which ttie building
is to be erected, or comment upon the de
lay. We should impress upon our repre
sentatives at Washington that we need to
have and want the work of excavation
and construction beg.vii as speedily as pos
sible.
"Now, what I propose is this: Let us as
a body join with the other bodies and or
ganizations now in this move, the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, the
Chamber of Commerce, the Board of
Trade of San Franc. sco, the California
State Board of Trade and the Merchants'
Association."
"That would be a good move and I am
in favor of it, that is if they desire our co
operation," remarked Contractor More
house.
"Have no fear about this point," said
Mr. Lewis. "I have seen Julian Sonntag
and some of the others, and they will be
only too well pleased to have us with
them. In fact, the entire body of the
Builders' Exchange is to be invited to be
present and participate in the joint mass
meeting that is to be held in the Chamber
of Commerce on Thursday. At that
gathering it is proposed to prepare a suit
able memorial to be presented to the
authorities at Washington urging them to
have the work on the Postoffice building
started at once; also to have our repre
sentatives in Congress ask, at the special
session, for an appropriation of about
$250,000, in order that the work, when
once started on the 5240,000 now on hand,
may not be stopped for the want of
money. In order that we may take the
first step in this direction I have prepared
this resolution for your consideration:
The resolution was adopted without
hesitation and it was decided that when
the big meeting is hold on Thursday,
President Lewis, accompanied by all who
will be able to attend, will take the reso
lution to the meeting and present it to
the body. It is believed that such an
act) oh will have much more effect upon
the movement and upon the people at
Washington than as tuough each organ
ization act by itself and forward to the
capital a promiscuous lot of resolutions,
and so it was decided.
WIIL SEND DELEGATES.
Tho Local Board of Trada Joins the
General Demand.
The San Francisco Board of Trade yes
terday afternoon appointed a representa
tive committee to join with the other
Ja-ge commercial bodies of tbe City in
hastily taking action calculated speedily
to bring about work upon the new Federal
building.
William Cluff, the wholesale grocer;
H. If. Holbrook of Holbrook, Merrill &
Stetson, â  hardware-dealers; Sanford Ben
nett of Dunham, Carrigan & Co., dealers
in machinery, are the delegates that were
named Jtfy President A. A. Watkins of the
Board of Trade at the meeting of the di
rectors.
"The sooner the work is begun the bet
ter.'.' said WilliaYn Cluff, chairman of the
committee. "It cannot be started too
soon, during the present condition of
workingmen in this City.. The expendi
ture of all that money here is just what
is needed torelieve the distress of tha un
employed. It would furnish a large num
ber of men with work.
â¢ "What is needed is an expression from
the combined business bodies of the City
urging upon our representatives in Con
gress tbe necessity for bringing every
effort to bear to have the new Postofiice
building started immediately. If the
people will demand it and urge it, and our
Congressmen will help, there should be
no further delay." â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 2, 1897.
A WESTERN
EXPOSITION
Arrival of the Omaha Dele
gates on Their Pacific
Coast Tour.
SECURED MONEY FROM
VARIOUS STATES.
Will Visit the Legislature To-
Day in Aid of a $50,000
Appropriation.
EXHIBIIION PRE-EMINENTLY
SBANS-MIS3ISSIPPIAN.
President Wattles and H E. Palmer
on the Support an: Purposs
of the Prrj:ct
The delegation of leading Omaha
citizens who have been making a tour of
nve or six Western and coast States for
some time past in the interest of the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition, arrived
here yesterday from Oregon in the special
car Silver City.
G. W. W r attles, president of the exposi
tion and a leading banker of Omaha,
heads the delegation. Besides him there
are G. M. Hitchcock, principal owner ot the
World-Ilerald; John L, Webstern, an at
torney; H. E. Palmer of the Board of Fire
and Police Commissioners; W. M. G.
Poppleton, a leading attorney, and Clem
ent Chase, editor of the Excelsior. A
number of ladies are in the iarty.
President Wattles and the other dele
gates visited the officers of the Board of
Trade and Chamber of Commerce after
their arrival. They interested both or
ganizations as far as possible, preparatory
to going to Sacramento to-day and call
ing on the Legislature. In several other
States money has either been appropri
ated or steps have been taken that way.
Captain Palmer said in regard to this:
"The Exposition Company is organized
on the stock basis of $1,000,000, one-half
of which is subscribed. Marvin Howett,
president of the Chicago and Northwest
ern Railroad, has just telegraphed us that
he has subscribed $UO,OO'J in aid of the ex
position.
"Congress in the first place appro
priated $200,000 toward it. The Slate of
Nebraska is to give $200,000. Colorado
will make a small appropriation. It has
recently had a hard time with the strikers
at Leadville, and is unable to give as
mu Mi as it otherwise would do.
"Besides these, the following States
have already appropriated, or have taken '
steps to do so: Montana, $25,000; Idaho,
$25,000; Utah, $30,000; Wiiabington, $25,
--000; Illinois, $100,000; Kansas, $40,000;
South Dakota, $20,0OU; North Dakota,
$25,000; Minnesota, $50,000; Missouri,
$75,000; New Mexico. $15,000.
"We also anticipate a small appropria
tion from Arizona. A number of these
States have been personally visited by us.
We have been received in the most gen
erous manner.
"To-morrow we will go before the Leg
islature at Sacramento. We hope to get
an appropriation from California of
$50,000. Everybody is recognizing what a
great thing the exposition is going to be
for all the Western country. It is to be
pre-eminently a Trans-Mississippi Expo
sition, and we think it will be as great as
any industrial exposition held in this
country.
"The exposition will open in June, 1898.
It will be a revelation as to what the West
is, though exhibits of all kinds from other
parts of the world will be made there."
President Wattles talked much in the
same vein, and was lull ol enthusiasm.
Hesaid It was the first time an exposition
on such a scale had been attempted west
of the Mississippi, barring the Midwinter
Fair, which had been carried through to
success here. He thought that Omaha,
too, as a place for the exposition would
open the eyes of many people.
"Afier we have been at Sacramento,
where we hope to get an appropriation of
$50,000," he said, "we will visit Carson,
where the Nevada Laglalature is in ses
sion. I don't know what it will do, but
we hope to get at least a small appropria
tion.
"On account of the deadlock in the Ore
gon Legislature which has prevailed thus
far, Ido not know whether we will get
anvthi;;g there. Colorado, lam assured,
will eive us bometbing. The strike ai
Lead ville has cost the State $300,000, but
it will do its best for us.
"The prospects for a great exposition
are, in the highest degree, nattering. It
will, in my judgment, be the greatest of
the kind ever held."
The delegates visited Chinatown last
night. They are at the Palace.
JUMPED HIS BONDS.
John llogan, Charged With Grand
larceny. Fails to Appear in
.Judge l.mv's Court.
John Hogan is a fugitive from justice
and Judge Low yesterday morning de
clared his bonds forfeited and Issued a
bench warrant fÂ«r his arrest.
Ho.an was arrested at the masked ball
in the Mechanics' Pavilion on the morn
ing ot January 1 for stealing a diamond
pin from Frank L. Noviega, who was
president of the ball committee.
The same day he was released on $2000
bonds, accepted by Judge Low. The sure
ties were Frank H. Meader, 2034 Pine

wno qualified on a lot 2232 Railroad

Meader is what is known as a profes
sional bondsman and is surety on numer
ous bonds in the Police Courts. Judge

woman was ordered into custody.
IN THREE WHITE CASKETS
Pastini's Children, Victims of
Poison Fungus, Carried to
the Vault.
As Socn as the Parents Recover the
Little B:d;es Will Bs
Crf matt d.
Three white hearses bearing three tiny
white caskets in which were incased the
little bodies of the sons of Mr. and Mrs.
Pastini, wheeled slowly away from the
desol"te home to the cemetery yesterday
afternoon.
Six horses, white as the mournful
hearses they drew, walked slowly abreast,
not one pair behind the other, as though
the little boys, poisoned at their last even
ing mea!, wished to be together in death,
as they were in life. Arriving at the cem
etery, the white caskels were placed side
by side in a cheerless vault, to wait until
the heartbroken parents have recovered
their health; then the bodies will be cre
mated.
Many friends followed the bo dies to the
cemetery and before the vault was closed
moved past the caskets to read the simple
inscriptions on the silver plates each bore.
They tell a sad story.
Egidio Pastini, aged 8 years, was the
first to die after bavin- eaten the poison
ous fungus at that fatal meal. On the
afternoon oi February 26 death claimed
him. A few uouÂ» afterward Tito, aged 5
years and II months, the youngest son,
succumbed to the poison. The eldest boy,
Attilio, aged 11 years and 6 days, strag
gled long for life, but he sank slowly into
a deeper and deeper sleep, from which he
could not be roused and it ended in death
on the morning oi February '28. There
were no religious services over the bodies.
Though the family had always been re
ligious, sill the last great blow seemed to
have robbed them of all faith, and the
children were buried without a word of
prayer.
Happiness Las gone out of the life of
Ricardo Pastini, father of the little boys.
For hours preceding the funeral he paced
up and down past the tiny caskets, paus
ing often to look upon the marble features
of his children, whom he had loved so
well and bad lost. He will not be coru
forted, and what makes his lot the harder
is in- belief that he is their slayer.
"There ihey lie, all dead together," he
would say, "and it was I who poisoned
them; poisoned them with my own
hands, and now how I sufferâ miserable,
miserable man that I am."
When the time for ihe funeral came the
scene was most pathetic. The lather and
mother and their daughter, little Eda,
are still suffering from the awful poison,
and fearing that it ruieht overtax their
strength the doctors fort ade their under
taking the journpy to the cemetery. At
2 o'clock the caskets were gently picked
up from the stools on which they rested
and were slowly carried to the waiting
hearses. The father and mother gazed at
each other in silent awe. Their grief was
too intense for tears.
In connection with the tragedy it has
been suggested that twenty-five or thirty
pellets of "anti-scrofuloso" administered
to the children would have saved them.
This is said to be an effective antidote
against that peculiar form of poisoning.
PLYMOUTH CHURCH PASTORATE.
Indications That Some Division Exists
Among the Congregation.
Eev. W. D. Williams, D.D., who has
filled the pastorate of Plymouth Concre
gational Church for the past seven years,
preached his farewell eermon last Sunday
and will probably leave for the East in
the ensuine month.
Though the pastor himself and the con
gregation deny the rumor that any divi
sion within the church itself has led him
to take this step, other sources of informa
tion would seem to justify the rumor. It
is known, for instance, that certain mem
bers of the congregation are so warmly
attached to Dr. Williams that they would
not hesitate to seyer their connection with
Tlyniouth Church if he could be induced
to accept a local call. So strong is the
feeling that about a fortnight ago a gen
tleman from Plymouth Church waited
upon Charles GecUes, an elder of the
Westminister Presbyterian Church, which
is at present without a regular pastor, and
askea him if tnat body would entertain a
proposition to appoint Dr. Williams to
till the vacancy, intimating that in the
event of such action being taken, a con
siderable proportion of the conuregation
would attend the Westminister Church.
Mr. Geddes hansel; declined to discuss,
though he did not deny the lact.
"Ol course such a proposition was ridic
nious," he said, briefly. "How could a
Presbyterian Church engage a Congrega
tional divine? Nor have we any desire to
be mixed up with the quarrels of our
neighbors."

So the Board of Supervi
sors Voted Yester
day.
Resolution Looking to Reducing
the Expense oi Hi.ding
E ections.
Merchants' Association F rms a P. an
lor the Impr.vem3i:t cf F.rst
Avenu?.
The Board of Supervisors voted yester
day afternoon, in accordance with the
recommendation of the Water Committee,
to visit the offices of the Spring Valley
Water Company Wednesday mornins*.
The Water Committee reported that they
had visited the o faces ol toe water com
pany yesterday forenoon. There they
made a demand for detailed information
concerning the compensation and salaries
of officers and employes of the company,
and generally for such other detailed in
formation as the board has sought from
the beginniifg of the water-rate inquiry.
They saw books and accounts, and
Charles Webb Howard, president of the
company, agreed to have prepared a de
tailed statement of the operating expenses
and expenditures of the company as re
quested by the board. Mr. Howard gave
assurances that all the mlormation that
was sought should be supplied, but some
of the facts were to be juven to the mem
bers oi the board in confidence.
The-e were the facts as they were re
ported by the Water Committee. Super
visor Clinton offered a resolution that the
board should visit the water company's
office- Wednesday morning at 10:30 o'clock
and ypoke to the que-tiou.
Supervisor Clinton said that the board
would be able to determine whether cer
tain facts should be received in confidence.
Mr. Howard had answered some questions
propounded by the Water Committee, but
had refused to answer vital questions i.
the answers were to be submitted to the
public, but he had said that he woul i
answer every question asked of him if
cerfain answers could be considered as re
ceived in confidence by the Supervisors:
Mr. Howard had sa d that he would satisfy
the Supervisors that his course would best
subserve the interests of the public.
Supervisor Clinton added that he was not
authorized to make any answer, he
therefore moved that the board should
visit the Spring Valley offices. Super
visor Kottanzi alone voted no.
The board also moved to meet again
next Friday evenirg to resume the con
sideration of the water rates.
The following resolution, which was in
troduced hy Supervisor Britt, was adopted:
Resolved, That the Legislature be petitioned
by the Board of Supervisors of the City and
County oi fcan Francisco to facilitate the pas
sage 01 the act reduiiug the expenses oi hold
ing Freeholders and charter elections, and
also of the joint resolution proposing a con
biitutional amendment bringing County as
well as City offices within the scope of a Legis
lative or Freeholders' charter.
The resolution concerning the placing
of the public priming anain went over.
Supervisor Smith opposed furtbev delay.
Supervisor Britt favored putting over lor
one week, because, he said, the Typo
graphical Union desired to be hear 1.
Supervisor Britt introduced a resolution
to apix'int Joseph J. Dunne as assistant
to the District Attorney.
Mayor Puelan 6poke on this proposi
tiou. Ue -;i.'l that an assistant attorney
had been engaged during the Durrant
trial, when the District Attorney was
crowd eo. with work. Now there would be
very little to do for the assistant, aud he
thought that it would be Hell to save the
$250 per month which it is proposed to
pay an assistant. The matter was laid
over for one week.
Supervisor Rottanzi introduced a reso
lution and spoke in favor of it, the pur
port of the resolution being to favor legis
lation to provide for the payment of the
City's creditors. The resolution was
unanimously adopted.
A resolution providing for the purchase
of certain inventions of fire apparatus
from H. H. Gorter was rescinded and an
other resolution was adopted in its stead,
limiting the amount to be paid to $Â£00,
upon motion 01 Supervisor Britt.
Action waÂ« postponed for one wei'k in
the matter of appointing an attorney for
the delinquent tax department. T be Ju
diciary Comm ittee recommended the ap
pointment of Alfred Fuhrmaun tor the
position.
A communication was received from the
Mutual Electric Light Company, g'ving
notice of an intention to commence dig
ging trenches, laying wooden conduits for
electric cables aud constructing manholes
m .-urtets as follows: Beginning at the
southerly corner of Market and Second
streets, thence along Market street toEast
street; also beginning at the junction of
Market and Spear streets, thence along
Spear street to Folsom street, and thence
along Foisom street about 150 feet east
er y. With this was also filed a bond of
$5000 to lay conduits.
Petitions were recently received from
the Pacific Athletic Club for p rmission
to hold a boxing tournament during the
month of March or April; from the Polk
street Improvement Club for a permit for
the Mutual Electric Licht Company to
erect three poles on each block on Polk
street, from Valiejo to Sutter, on Sutter,
from Polk to Larkin, on Larkiu, from Sut
ter to McAllister, and on McAllister, from
Larkin to Jones.
The Merchants' Association nsked that
action concerning the proposed bitumin
izing of First avenue bt-tween the Presidio
gate and Golden Gnte Park be postponed.
Tne reason given lor this was as follows:
This association is informed by a number of
the property-owners that it is the desire of
6 majority of them to increase the roadway
of -aid avei'Ue by reducinc the widtn, of the
sidewalks from tw<-nty-two to seventeen feet,
or such width as will meet with ihe approval
of your honorable board. Your petitioner be
lieves that this will in time become a most
popular and much traveled boulevard, and for
this reason it respectiully requests your hon
orable board to delay action for two weeks,
during which time your letitioner will call
a meeting ot the property-owners, and will
theu lay before your honorable board a propo
rtion which we think will be for the interests
of the City.

One of the Foremost Medical
Men of America,
Mis Success, Education, Experience
and Integrity Warrant the
Broadest Claims.
Thousands From All Parts of (lie Coan*
try Jtestored to Health Who Had
'IJuen Given Ip- by Other â¢
I'hysic.ar.-i. . .
If graduation with highest hopors from
one of the foremost medical colleges of
America; if zealous effort while in atiend-
bnce at the most prominent hospitals of
London, Paris, Berlin',. Heidelberg,
Munich, Vienna, Florence, Ro-me and St.
Petersburg; if ten years .of practice in
one location' with thousands of cases- suc-
cessfully treated and the warm friendship
of all who have ever been "on the list of
patients is a sufficient .guarantee of the
standing and renab.lity of a- practicing
physician and specialist, Dr. F. L. Sweany
of this City U entitled' to rank as One of
the first. m nof his profession in the land*.
It has come to be a recognized fa.ct . in re-
cent years that a spec.a'iut .in .any class of
diseases becomes an expert in thai par-
ticular line. This is a day of: specialists .
and to this -alone is attributable tne rapid
advancement of science in ail -branches
and partidiarl v is this true in the practice
of medicine and surgery. Diseases which
a few years ago were considered as incura-
ble have become through- the, efforts of
the eminent specialist, Dr. F. L. fcw^any,
easy to master anU permanently cure.
Resulting ir.,m las auvanced ideas and
phenomenal success, Dr.- '-Sweauy's ciffices
at737 Market street are- d.aily crowded try
those, who have con.hdenee in his skill.
His la;ne has reached ail over, the world
so that patients mdy be found in nis con-
sultation rooms who. have traveled from
remote distances to avail themselves of
his lainous services and advice. To this
reason can ba traced the wide acquaint*
anceahip h possesses and the host of
friends he has ah over the United States
and the honors loaded upon him .by sci-
entific societies and benevolent institu-
tions all over the world.
It is an admitted fact that Dr. Sweany
has the largest practice at any specialist
on the comment, and also an admitted
fact that he is -the most successful prac-
titioner.
In speaking of his specialties in a re-
cent interview the doctor said; "I treat
blood", skin disoidersf, female complaints,
stricture, liver, lunts, stomach and heart
diseases, piles, rupture, hydrocele, vanco*
cele and kindred troubles.
"Above it U things, I strive to save the
thousands of young and middle-aged men
who are plunging toward the grave, tor-
tured by the woes of .nervous debility. I
am self-confident regarding my treatment
of this phase of disease. And whenever a
patient is curable (.and th<s incurables are
rare exceptions) I seed him put with liie
into a ne.w world*"- .
When asked if his practice was confined
to his office solely, he replied, '"O.i, no 1
I have hundreds oi patients tjarougnout
tue country whose cases are successfully
treated by confidential correspondence."
It may be relied upon tha.t Di\ F. L.
Bweany makes no promises that his edu-
| cation, expeneiice ) age and history x>l his .
practice do not justify.

CHICAGO, 11i,.. March 1 âThe most serious
drawback to tbe wheat market was lue dull busi
ness to-day. Complaints of the inactivity were
heard on a.l sides, commNsio.i-hiuses being the
principal sufferers. The market behaved irrezu
larly during the morning, opening firm, declining
about 1.2 cent, and then recovering the loss. In
terest as usual on Monday centered in the visible
supply, and the pro-pect of a liberal decrease was
responsible for the rally from the early low point.
Weak London and Berlin cahles and an increase
in Liverpool stoctcn of 152.000 bushe s of whent
and of 9,0-0 sacks of flour caused the sel ing
which carried the market off af:er the opening.
Liverpool < ab.es were i/^d hishpr. Receipts at
Chicago were 25 cars, ai.d 62,868 bushels were
taken from store.
The Nonhwest had 340 cars against 509 a year
ago. The amount, on ocean pa<*age i.ecrea-ed
1,760,000 bushels. The announcement of very
light world's shipments for the week, 636,000
bushels, and the reduction in the visible supply of
1,41Â£,u00 busheis started shorts to buying, a
further enhancement to prices taking piace. The
Eng.ish visible aupplv decreased 266,000 bushels.
Closing Berlin cables weie 3Â£ mark lower. Paris
and Antwerp were enjoying n. holiday. Export
clearances were light at '.'34,318 bmhels. May
wtieat opened from 74 %c to 7431 c. sold between
7*y cand 7514 c. closing at 76Vi@75%c, :! 4(?i%c
hicher than Saturday. Kstlrnateu receipts tor to
morrow. 38 cars. No. 2 red, spot, wheat ranged
from 833/ 8 c to 85V c, closing about S4Vi(*BsV.<c.
CORNâ The corn market was dull but firm.
Transactions bore no mÂ«r<s ot improvement or
Interest, ouly small lots being traded in. outside
orJers were few, and scalping was all that kept
the markt-t from falling into complete listlessness.
Tne firmiipss in tone was ascribed 10 the strength
of wheat and the decrease In the amount of ocean
passaie of 480,000 busheU. Liverpool -.-.ibles
were a sbade lower, and siocks at thai place in
creased 152,000 bnshels. Receipts at Cliicasto
were 337 cars, and 64.890 bushels were taken

bushels. Exports were liberal at 1,048, 1v0 bu<h
els. May corn opened st 24i.\ advanced to 24Vs@
Vie, closing at 24i c, Vs&Vic higher than oa
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 240
cars.
i OATSâ There was some short selling of oats at
the opening, but as the sales did not prove im-
I mediately profltah'e the property was covered,
1 the result being a firmer tone. Trad-rs looked to
j the other market for motive. Receipts weie 220
I cars. There were no withdrawals from store.
Export c.earances were 141. bushels. The
visible supply increased 332,000 buÂ»heis. May

receipts of cattle to-day were of about the propor
tion of tbose of recent Mon lays and practically
the same as on the corresponding day a year ago,
being estimated at 14,000 head. Business started
active at an early hour, and prices for the gen
eral run of cattle were steady, while for the few
! offerings that graded as choice sellers succeeded
I in obtaining an advance of about 10 rents.
To-day* receipts of hogs were about 40,000.
against 42,166 last Monday, 25,902 a year ago

â¢ â¢ 908 Broadway, March 1. (
The last week of the campaign is
already "rtrpducing some unlooked-for
combinations hnd mild sensation!*, though
it is aot expected that anything particu
;.larly radical will transpire, between now
. and next Monday.
The leading issue at present is over the
saloons, and the individual aspirations of
candidates are almost lost signt of in the
earnestness with which tne matter of
closing, the saloons- is being' contested.
The Seventh-day Adventists have issued
a pamphlet in' which they earnestly advo
cr.re closing the salocms. Though, vigor
â¢ opposed to any attempt to have
V m closed on Sunday, because of their
rvsst experience with Sunday laws, they
are very earnest in their championship of
t'-mperance and wish to see the saloons
closed entirely.
Up to the present time, .with the except
tion of the Prohibition ticket, which has
never cut any figure' in local politics, the
only candidate who has declared himself
in favor of closing is M. W. Upton, t tie
Republican nominee for Corincilman from
the f hir.; Ward.
It is probable that during the coming
we-k some of the biker candidates in
dorsed by the anti-saloon -party may de
claie themselves,, but at present saloon
cosinsr is a rock around" whichall are nav
igating very carefully.'
Another little side issue in the campaign
. \-the collapse of the friendship between
Mayor Davie and. Ben Morgan, the Berke
ley aUorney. Since -Mr. Davie came
into public notice ; a few year? .ago Ben
Morgan has been ono of bis most able
champions, and q-q many -occasions has
appeared as Mr. Davie's personal attorney.
In a let er written to the presidents the
Â»' uncil, who has always heert opposed to
Davie., Mr. Morgan says tbat his advocacy
of Davie's. cause two years ago insured L is
election.. He also states that he has since
changed his mind, and that Mr. Davie
. "How did this happen? 'â ' -cx

BURRILL'S GRAVE WORDS
The High Scaool Language Pro
fessor Makes a Remarka
b'e s.tat?ment.
S^ys Experience Has Led the Faculty
to Conlcmn tb.2 Whole System
of Teichin^.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broatlway, March 1. f
Professor Burnll, head of the language
department of the Hitrh School, has issued
a rather sensational letter, in which he
very candidly criticizes the present ad
ministration of school affairs. He says
th.it .it is absurd to expect the best result
where the Superintendent of Schools is also
the business manager of the department.
In conclusion heaays:
I am now about to mats a very grave state
ment. For several years* myself und colleague
in the High School have received the finished
product of tiie lower schools, and havo tested
it as a basis for nigner work: therefore \>e are
better qualified to Judge as to us exact va.ue
than anybody els". Therefore, deliberately, I
pronounce the work unsatisiactory to an un
due and serious degree.
The teaching force of Oakland I believe to
be as efficient as any in trie State. The condi
tion of the pupils when the? leave the gram
mar schools proves the leaching to be efficient.
Thi-y possess an amount of knowledge satisfac
tory large. But li is not the right kind of
knowledge; it is not sufficiently well ordered;
it is not sufficiently definite and firm along
fun iamental lines.
The average pupil cannot be relied upon to
be found along any sing c given line of knowl
edge which any teacher of experience would
grant he ought to know when he loaves the
irrarr.mar school. Furthermore, I am in
formed by some of tne best teacners in the
department â though it follows as a corollary
to the above statementâ that exactly tne same
condition of affair* prevails all along the line
down the grades, This s-hÂ»vrs nothing in the
world but a iack of direction and continuity;
a lack of articulation from grade to grade; a
diff useness and lack of concentration through
out the whole system.
Again, too much of the pupils' time Is con
sumed in recitation, and not enough in sus
tained, self-re. :ant, concentrated study.
Consequently the pupils ire weak in ability
to apply Jhemselvos effectively to any task
independently of the teacher, 'ihis, too) is the
result of diffusem siâ of having so many
things to do that the children r ally have no
clear idea of what they are expected to do.
And what is true of the pupils cannot but be
true of the tenc&ers nl*o, to v less degree and
on a more elevated plane.
To mark out, thereiore, minimum lines of
emj:has:s from the intricate network of the
Whole curriculum, to give direction and con
tinuity to what mu?t otherwise be a multitude
of detacned forces, to inspect mid test, to set
standards, this is the work of the superin
tendent. No one else can do it.
In New England cities with which 1 have
been acquainted the sui'erinttndent Is a
teacher of teachersâ an educational expert.
In the Oakland schools there is no adequate,
thorough-going worK; no superintendence on
the educational side. The subsidiary office of
clerk of the Board of Education and business
agent of the department has largely absorbed
the principal office, for which the other exist*.
Now, if what I have said is true, it is maiter
of vital public raumeut. That it is true is the
intense and almost universal feeling o: the
teachors throughout the department, and they
an: the people who know oetter than Â«nybo<iy
e-lse â better than the Board of Education can
know. AVitli the knowledge, therefore, that
matters like those of which I speak are, for
many reasons, not usually open to the public,
ana with the firm conviction that the public
has a riÂ«ht to know the real condition of the
school system, I have taken It upon myself to
speak asa high and solemn duty.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 2, 1897.
A BRIDEGROOM
AND HIS WOES
Young Rauch Refuses to
Air His Family Affairs
in Court.
Threatened to End His Father
iz-Law's Lie and Must
Stand Trial.
The Bride Ran to Her Father and
the Husband Jumped Out of a
Window
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 1. j
William Rauch, the young bridegroom
who offered some time ago to fight a duel
with his father-in-law with knives, for the
possession of his wife, was in the Police
Court this morning to answer a charge of
threatening the life of Waiter Saviile, his
wife's father.
Rauch made a lUtle speech in which he
staied that the whole matter was a family
quarrel and related to details of far too
sacred a nature to he exposed in the Police
Court. He refused to nubpena his wife
and mother, and stated that his father-in
law had, since the affair occurred, prom
ised not to press the charge.
Two wreks ago Rauch'3 wife, who wa3
formerly Miss Saville, made a complaint
to her father that ?he was being retained
in her home against her will. Prior to
the marriape t;-,ere was a dispute and tbe
young lady and her father rather hurried
the wedding. But after it was over every
body seemed pleased that the tragedy had
been averted. Two weeks ago the war
was reopened and the young lady told
her father that she feared her life would
be sacrificed if something were not done
with Rauch. Saville went to Rauch's
home armed for the purpose of releasing
his captive daughter. Rauch grabbed a
knife, and for a time it looked as thoueh
murder would be committed. But the
young husband ended matters by leaping
through a window and making his escape
v hile Saville walked off with his dauchter.
After this event Rauch informed W. H.
Champion, who i 9 one of the friendj of
the Savil'es, that it was his intention to
recover his bride or have the life of her
lather. He showed Champion the weapons
with which he intended to carry out his

and arrested and taken into court this
morning, where he told his story.

and set his case for trial to-morrow. Papa
Saville says he is prepare! to resist any
attack from younsr Rauch, and that i;
will be a life fora life if the young hus

OBJECT TO MALI.
Horses and Cows o:i the Russell Ranch
Are Temperate.
OAKLAND, Cal., March I.â The horses
and cows ot Thomas B. Russell and Fred
erick J. Russell are temperance animals.
Their owners p.re prominent temperance
advocates of Haywards. The Russells
own a tract of land along the San Leandro
Creek where they pasture their stock.
The animals refused to drink the waters
of the creek which bad been polluted, so
it is alleged, by the adjacent brewery
owned by John Bucken, and which are
said to have a brewery flavor. The taste
of malt is not acceptable to the horses and
cattle and they have indignantly refused
to quench their thirst in the tainted pool.
On account of these circumstances the
Rubsells have just filed an amended com
plaint claiming $1000 for the loss of the
use of their animals and $9000 damages to
the property by reason of the "indecent
and offensive odor and appearance of
the creek."

with the Oakland local, and Alameda pas
sengers will change cars at Fruitvale.
There nre to be four extra tracts laid at
the Oakland mole to do away with the

used by the local westbound trains. For
this purpose it will be necessary to fill in
a section 200 feet in width, and a fence will
be erected m that none but ticket holders
can pass. On the north side of the pier a
fill of 100 feet will be made and the
wagon road will be located there. When

A VETERAN'S DEATH.
Charles K. White's Bnsy and Success
ful ! i'<- Closes.
OAKLAND, Cal., March I.â Charles E.
Whit?, an old-time real-estate man, died
in East Oakland yesterday. A few years
ago he was the most prominent realty
dealer in this city, and during Oakland's
boom, about ten years ago, he was one of
the most successful dealers.
Mr. White was a veteran of the Civil
Was, and an active member of Lyon Post,
G. A. R. Wiien he first came to California
from Maine, where he was born fifty-two
years ago, Mr. White settled at Golden
Gate, and did much to build up that
suburb. About five years ago he moved
to Twsniy-tlurd avonue and has since re
sided thero.
Although a very successful man years
ago, the hard times brought financial
difficulties, and he gradually saw his for
tune slipping from his grasp, and this did
much to bring about his death. A year
ago he relinquished his real estate busi
ness, and devoted himself entirely to
prospecting and mining, owning consider
able stock in mining interests in Amador
County.
The deceased leaves a widow and four
children, and the remains will be interred
in the G A. R. plat in Mountain View
Wednesday morning.
SELLING PELTON'S BOOKS
Secretary Welch Thinks the
Childrea Should Not Be Al
lowed on the Train.
The Case UnJer Investigation by
Mrs. Prescott of th? Chil
dr m 's Sec ety.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call.^
908 Broadway, March L >
J. C. Pelton has been notified that it is
not proper for him to permii his two lit
tle girls to sell his pamphlets and poems
on the local train.
Secretary Welch of the parent society
has notified Mrs. Prescott that complaints
have been made to bim regarding the
cDildren, that they should not be permit
ted to meet all classes of people and to
sell books at all times on the trains, and
he has requested the local secretary to
take such steps as may be necessary to
stop ihe work of the children.
"I have investigated ttiis case," said
Mrs. Prescott to-day, "and I have found
that the children do not miss their school,
aud I think that their position has not
been thoroughly understood by the parties
who have made complaints. They go on
the train with their mother, who keeps a
personal supervision over them, and they
are regular attendants at the Tompkins
School."
The Peltons live in three rooms on Mar
ket street. The family consists of Mr.
Pelton and his wife and threp young chil
dren. MrÂ«. Pelton is suffering from
dropsy and is unable to do any manual
labor beyond her housework. Their
sparsely furnished quarters, though
cramped and innocent of luxury, are well
arranged and cared for, but the income of
the family is so small that life is nothing
more than a continual struggle up the
narrow edge of existence.

SIX FAVORITES
TOPPLED OVER
The Talent at iDgleside
Kept in a Muddled
State.
Green Morris' Mid ight Takes a
Race From a Clever Lot
of Sprinters.
Charlomagne Wias at Odis of 10 to i
Gu'ta Perciia Fa>t tha Wire
First ct 8 to I
Though the day was cold and disagree
able, with the clouds threatening a watery
downpour at any moment, the largest
Monday crowd of the season, if Washing
ton's birthday is excepted, attended the
races at Ingleaide yesterday. Quite in
keeping with the sport the past few daya,
favorites found a very rocky road to travel.
The fifth race was -declared off, and the
well- played choices in all of the other
events were all toppled over. The longest
pric d win ncr of the day was Charlemagne,
carrying Barney Schreiber's colors, which
took the opening mile run at odds of 10
to 1, Twenty bookmakers weighed in and
did a good business.
The track was heavy next the rail, mak
ing any sort of good time an impossibility.
By far the best race of the day was the
fourth, with five fast sprinters facing the
barrier. In the betting the Baldwin filly
Ceioso, ridden by "Sheets" Martin, was
the favored vne, backed from 13 to 5 to 11
to 5. Greyhurst and Midlight were well
supported at trille longer odds. The
favorite and Greyhursst slipped away in
the lead at a break-neck pace, and by the
time tUe stretch was reached were willing
to stop and take a rest. .Applause now
loomed up as a dangerous quality, and
the friends of Purser's mare hegan feeling
for their tickets, when Midliubt came
spinning along on the inside and put it
on the daughter of 111 Used a neck in
1:16%. Greyhurst was a tired third.
Mil.cr carried too much weight, being
unable to get to the front.
Thirteen cheap-selling platers went to
the post in the opening event of the after
noon, a mile dash, with Treachery ruling a
3to 1 tavorite. The winner turned up in
Charlemagne, a 10 to 1 shot which headed
Play Boy in the stretch and led that horse
pasi the wire a head in I:46J^. Tar and
Tartar was a poor thud.
The first and second choices were top
pled over again in the seven-furlong sell
ing run that followed. Two Cheers was
sent to the post an 8 to 5 choice with
Meadow Lark next In demand. The out
sider Roadrunner led the bunch until
within a furlong of the wire, where he was
overhauled by Camelia and beaten out a
length by the Uorrlgan entry. Meadow
Lark was third in a drive.
Old Frank X was installed favorite at
odds of 11 to 5 to win the third event, also
at seven furlongs. He did not carry much
coin as the wise crowd strung their checks
on the chances of Masoero which was
backed down from 6 to 4}Â£. When the
barrier was raised "Slteeto" Martin
hustled Gutta Percha away in front, and
the mnre lasted lon>: enoueh to beat
Double Quick out half a length at the
finish. The favorite was a poor third.
The big coin made The Sinner a top
heavy favorite for the fifth event, a five
furione scramble with a field of nine start
ing. True Blue, the 3to 1 second choice
ridden by P*ggott, jumped out in the lead
with the favorite at liis heel?. Sloan on
the first choice drew his bat at the pad
dock, but could not get up and was
downed a short half length in 1:03%.
Mercutio was third. Alazan and Wood
land Belle were left at the post.
Pat Dunne's unlucky Leonatus colt
Sten,tor was again made a warm favorite
for the final race of the day, a mile purse
affair. Going to the post at odds of 4to 5.
Tod Sloan again succeeded in getting him
away last, and he finished second to

Eventful Night
BERKELEY, Cal, March I.â Henry
Frank, a deaf and dumb instructor in the
State institution for the deaf and blind,
was Btopt>ed late last night by a highway
man, who presented a pistol and threat
ened Frank's life. The latter, being per
fectly deaf, heard no words spoken, but
it is presumed that hi 9 assailant ordered
him to give up his valuables.
Instead of complying with such a re
quest the deaf-mute struck the pistol with
one hand and with the other brought his
umbrella into play, breaking it over the
footpad's head. The latter took fright
and tied, and Frank proceeded to arouse
residents of the locality. His adventures
for the evening were not over, however,
and he succeeded in creating a good deal

ALAMEDA'S CAMPAIGN.
It Is In Full Swing and Candidates-Are
Numerous. â¢ , , â¢. â¢â'â¢â â¢
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 1. âThe muni
cipal campaign is in full swing and the
field is full of candidates,- One â¢thing :
stands out prominently, and that ia the
entire absence of partisan politics in the .. â¢
fight. The term "Republican" and "Dem- .
ocrat" are scarcely heard, and the politfcs
of the candidates cut little or no figurer m
the canvass, indeed are scarcely dis- '. .
cussed. Good government irrespective- of . .
partisanship is'the motto of the people of
Alaraeda, and in this as in many other
respects they are determined to set agood â¢
example to other municipalities. There,
has been some slight attempt at injecting . â¢
partisan considerations into the cam- â 
paign, but it has been vigorously frowned .
upon by the great body of v6ters, and the '
effort has proved completely abortive.
The Good Government Club, an organiza
tion numbering from 1700 to 1800 of the
best citizens of the place, is taking a very
active part in the campaign, though it *
bad been predicted that it would not be .
heard from. â¢ . ! ' V

MORE ROOM MAY SOON BE
PURCHASED.
It Means Work for the Unemployed
and Better Business for the 0!d
Parts of the City.
Bateman Brothers, the contractors, who
are to rebuHd the old City Kali at Wash
ington and Kearny streets, made many
beam glad yesterday by putting a large
gang of laborers at work preparing the ex- '
cavations and digging out the old founda
tions to make way for the new structure.
The Cam, has .long and often urged the
speedy buiidftig of the hall, since the ap
propriati6ri of $300,000 for .that purpose
has long been made. The sound of pick
jind shovel yesterday brought cheer to
many despondent hearts and gave promise
to many willing workers among the un
employed; who have been waiting and
matching for something to do for many
month;.
The beginnine of work on the City
building .will be the signal for consider
able worfc in other auarters adjacent. The
Morgue people- expect to be obliged to
move very soon, while Phil Dolan and
' others have been notified to vacate the
propc-ity at Merchant street and Dunbar
alley by tbe 15th of this month to enable j
the owners of the property to build a new
structure.
Dolan was very happy over the work
yesterday and he spoke for the masses of
the business men in the vicinity when he
said: "The sound of the workingmen
brought' joy to my heart, for it means a
revival of business down in this historic
end of town. T\ r e will all rejoice wben the
multitudes throng the temple of justice
down here again, bringing their quota of
bnsiness to this end of town."
Ned Laniean, the well-known local
politician and Deputy Internal Revenue
Collector, was present to watch the work.
He said:
"This is one of the best things that has
ever been done in the town. It means a
return of business to the north end, and,
finally, that there will be a better class of
bnsiness up this way. As I have spent
most of my life in the north end 1 rejoice
in the good work this Board of Super
visors is doing. I hope the work will be
taken up without delay, so as to give the
unemployed a good chance, thereby re-

lieving the labor situation, in a manner, of
its present com estion."
Ex-Superviso Joseph King was an in
terested spectator of tne work to-day.
Speaking of it he said: "I believe it will
be generally conceded that the beginning
of this work is one of the best thinÂ«B that
has ever occurred for this part of town.
"We ought to have had the whole lot,
including the northeast corner now occu
pied by old buildings. The owners wanted
$87,000 originally, but I believe they are
now willing to take $50,000, and the bill to
enable the City to luy it is now pending
in the Senate, having passed the Assem bly,
Of course the old board could have con
demned, the property and made the hall
the size desired, but that would have ie
sulted ta lawsuits, appeals and delays. I
think nad we gone ou in that way the hall
would riot have been started before the
year 1900. What we want is a hall for tne
people now on earth and work for the un- |
employed who are now begging for the
privilege of earnine bread.
"I believe the City will soon acquire the
jog at the northeast corner by a com pro
mise with the owners; in other words, by
a peaceable purchase."
James Gibb was happy over the work
yesterday. He is very much delighted
with Chairman Sheehan of the Building
Committee of the Board of Supervisors.
"Sheehan is Â»n energetic fellow," said j
Mr. Gibb, "and he seems to take a per
sonal interest in the progress of the work.
1 notice that he comes here often and sur
veys the situation. In fact, though lam
a Democrat, I must say that, the Repub
licans have shown nerve in tliis matter.
Th'.s board seems to be composed of pro
gressive, young blood, and I believe good
results are to follow what they are doing
about the ball."
Coroner Haw Kins said: "It is a good
thing tne worn has begun. We need a
new morgue and this part of thn town
needs the impetus the building will give
to business. Since the appropriation has
been made there is no reason for delay. I
believe $300,000 has been Â«et aside for the
entire work, and the contract has been
let for $260 000. 1 am glad building has
commence'l."
Colonel Grannis said: "Nothing better
has been undertaken for years. I am
sorry there was any delay at all after the
old structure was torn down. It seems
natural and just that the police courts be
in this central part of town."
Oscar T. Shuck said: "It was a blow to
the north end when the police courts and
central station were moved away. I shall
rejoice with all others when they are re
established. The site of the old ball is
historic, adjoining Court Block. All
pioneers will be glad wben the building is
well under way."
George D. Sbadburne of the North End
Improvement Club is working diligently
to have the City buy the northeast corner
of the lot where the hall is to be built, end
he is hopeful that the Senate will pass the
bill enacting the purchase, so that the
work can go on without delay.
And such were the opinions of repre
sentative citizens everywhere. It was the
general idea that the immediate work of
construction will be a blessing to the en
tire City as well as a specially opportune
relief for many of the unemployod.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, M<|RCH 2, 1897.
IS SHE THE ELOPING
PRINCESS ELVIRA?
A Strange Lady Said to
Be a "Countess of the
Blood Royal."
Is Registered at the Palace as
the Ccuntess Espanola and
Keeps From View.
J. M. Oakley, Claiming to Be a Cou
rier and With Loads of Money,
Accompanies Her.
Curiosity was aroused yesterday among
people at the Palace Hotel and elsewhere
as to the identity of a handsome young
lady at the aforesaid hostelry who had
registered as the Countess Espanola.
The Countess came the previous evening
on the train from Los Angeles, accompa
nied by a man about f>o years old, with
short, bushy and somewhat grayish whis
kers. He wore a neat- fitting check busi
ness suit of fine material and seemed by
his manner to be an Englishman. He had
money in plenty, looked distinguished
and was treated with that consideration
which distinction has the prerogative of
claiming unto itself.
When the man, however, came to regis
ter at the caravansary he had inscribed in
addition to the name Countess Espanola,
"valet, maid and courier." There was no
valet or maid in sight, and this was called
to his attention. He said that made no
difference, that he would pay for their
rooms anyway. He had at tirst demurred
at registering at all, saying as a reason
that the lady was a countess and did not
wish to be known. It was with some dif
ficulty that he could be persuaded that
the names must go en the oook. He said
as ior himself he was a courier, and
was escorting the countess on her pere-
Beginning Work on the Foundation of the Hall of Justice.
grinations. He said his name was J. M.
Oakiey.
The couple were assigned to suite 162,
on the first floor, consisting of four
rooms. It is on the corner of Market and
New Montgomery streets and is one of
finest in the house, formerly it was oc
cupied by ex-President Barillas and fam
ily, and before them by numbers of other
persons of prominence.
The attention of passengers on the train
had been attracted to them by their man
ners and by the drinking of wine in lib
eral quantities. The delay and conversa
tion about registering also called atten
tion to themselves and caused the story
of the escapades on the train to be re
counted.
I'.rith had trunks as well as hand bag
gage. One singular thing about Oakley's
trunk was that it was literally plastered
all over with Dapers indicating that they
had been in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna,
Florence, and almost every capital in Eu
rope. It was dotted and splotched like a
checker-board with these, and the trunk â
a huge one, by the way, also showed that
its possessor had been a guest at some of
the greatest European and American
hotels, one of the latter being the St.
Charles of New Orleans.
The lady in the case, who Oakley said
was "a princess of the blood royal," had
a trunk on which appeared in black leu
ter-Â«, besides the splotches of paper tags,
"Miss Jessie Taylor." Miss Taylor, other
wise the princess of the blood royal regis
tered as countess, was not much in evi
dence. She kept in the background, and
afterward, when a visit was made to the
apartments in company with Mr. Oakley,
the royal lady secured the seclusion of an
other room.
Yesterday morning the couple who had
aroused each interest appeared below.
The attendant of the fair lady c& lied for
his bill, announcing that he was going
away. As one report had it, they were
going to Los Angeles; another, that they
were merely going to change to some up
town hotel.
Be that as it may, they secured
a victoria and drove away. How
ever, they did not send their baegage
away, though this aDpears not to liave
been Known to the desk force at the hotel.
Their surprise was great, therefore, when
the Countess and Oakley again came to
the hotel at about 4 o'clock. They were
reassigned to the same rooms.
In a short time it was whispered about
that the mysterious lady was possibly
none other than (lie famous Princess El
vira of Spain, the dangnter of Don Carlos,
the lively lady who eloped to this country
a few months back and has .since been in
seclusion when not traveling incog.
Oakley was asked to express himself
about this.
'"The lady," he said, mysteriously, "is a
Princess of the blood royal; that's who
she is. We are to sail on the China on
Thursday for the Orient. Last year I was
in San Francisco with the Countess yon
Schlutterback of Germany, who is now at
Los Angeles, and whom we have recently
met there. She is a great friend of mine."
Mr. Oakley, however, sometimes when
he bad talked for a time would contradict
himself as to the lady with him being of
royal blood. He had an abundance of
money ana turned it loose on all occa
sions like water. From the advances
made on sundry bottles of champagne it
appeared that the bill for that beverage
alone would be no light one. Oakley
avows that ha is enjoying himself exceed
ingly.
"Look at this," said the companion of
the pretty Countess, and he took from his
pocket a paper and held it aloft for inspec
tion. It was a letter of credit for Â£1000,
or $5000.
"I nave plenty of cash." be said; "if I
hadn't I wouldn't be on this trip."
The attendants at the hotel say that
Oakley treats the lady witti the greatest
politeness and consideration. He is to all
appearances her ready iervitor, and pays
her the greatest respect. The Countess is
of medium height, with very dark hair
and eyes, and is quite young in appear
ance.
DEATH BEFORE HUNGER.
Suicide of Richard Carnell, an Aged
Clerk, Who Wsi Out of
Employment.
Richard Carnell, a clerk, aged 68 years,
committed suicide in his room at the
Workingmen's Hotel, at 907 f'olsom street,
on Sunday night by taking laudanum
and opium.
He left a rambling letter for the Coro
ner, in which he said that he had been
robbed of his all by a lawyer who had de
fended him against a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon and that he was
tired of life. He owed the landlord of the
hotel for room rent and stated in a letter
to that individual tliat he had eaten
nothing for several days and did not care
to further fight against adversity.
The letter to the Coroner was written
on black-bordered mourning paper ar.d
inclosed in a mourning envelope. It is
not known whether he has relatives in
this City.
Several years ago he kept a fruit-stand
on Montgomery street and later was em
ployed in a furniture store at Los Angeles.
'Water Rates Investigation Postponed.
There was no meeting of the Board of Super
visors in committee of the whole last night to
resume the water-rates investigation, as it was
dccide'l at the afternoon meeting ol the board
to hold the next session on Friday evening
next at 7:30 o'clock. Through some misun
derstanding the Spring Valley witnesses and
others were not notified ot this determination,
and the consequence was thai, for the space of.
at least one hour last night Chief Engineer

and a number of the general public paced the
bleak corridors of the City Kail, muttering

phoned Supervisor Rivers, and a minute latef
there was a stampede in the direction of the

ACCUSES THE CAPTAIN.
A Discharged Waiter of the
Steamer Dauntless Makes
Charges.
Says the Commander of the Vessel
Left the Wheel to Drink Beer
in the Cabin.
C. B. Manges, formerly a waiter on the
river steamer Dauntless. haÂ§ filed charges
with the inspectors of steam vessels in the
Appraiser's building against Captain
George Goodell of the steamer. In part
the complaint reads as follows:
On or about February 2, between the hours
ol 1 and 2 a. m., while nearing Valentine
landing, Hnd while the steamer was loaded
with wheat and passengers, and while Captain
Goodell should have been at the wheel, the
steamer being in motion, the said Captain
Gooaell did neglectfully and deliberately
leave the pilot-house and go into the cabin,
where he spent forty-five minutes in drinking
beer and in conversation with several persons,
including the purser. At this time the said
Goodell was supposed to be at the wheel, the
pilot. Captain Andrews, being in bed, having
left the pilot-house at 12 o'clock at night, as
is customary every night. The said Captain
Goodell, on leaving the pilot-house, had an
unlicensed man at the wheel. From my per
sonal knowledge this state of affairs has ex
isted on the Dauntless since September last,
thus endangering the lives of many people
and much property. On more than one occa
blou I have found the snid Goodell iv the
bridal chamber with Mrs. Joseph, the stew
ardess, when he should have been at the
wheel.
Manges was formerly an enploye of
tbe steamer and a few days ago eloped from
Btockton with Miss Maud Spring, the
daughter of a furniture dealer. The
parents followed the couple to this City
and located them at 121! Fourth street.
Manges was arrested, but was discharged
from custody in the Police Court and at
once married the girl.
He blamed Captain Goodell for his ar
rest.
Manges names his witnesses as follows:
Chief Engineer Healey, First Mate John
son, waiters Frank and Nick Costa;
Richard Brown, pantryman; Ben Berg
ener, watchman, and George Cameron,
purser.
IMPRISONED IN
A WRECKED HACK
The Frightened Passengers
Climhed Through the
Windows.
Curious Accident to a Party
Returning From the Pas
tini Funeral.
Springs Snapped and Jammed the
Doors So That the Ladies
Could Not Escape.
A curious accident, that delayed two
cnr lines for nearly half an hour and
placed two ladies in an exceedinelv em
barrassing position for a portion of that
period, occurred at the intersectiou of
Kearny and Clay streets about 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon.
A carriage containing four occupants â
two ladies and two gentlemen â was pro
ceeding along Kearny street toward Wash
ington, and had just reached the center
of Clay street, when there was a sound of
snapping steel as the springs collapsed
completely, and the front of the body of
the vehicle dropped on to the forward
axle, nearly pitching the driver from his
elevated perch and badly frightening
those inside.
The passengers were friends of the Pas
tini family, recently poisoned by eating
fungi, supposed to be mushrooms, and
were returning from the funeral of the
three children who died when the accident
occurred.
Their fears were not allayed when on
trying the doors they found them
jammed fast by the front wheels of the
carriage. Cars on both Kearny and Clay
streets were close at hand, and their I
clanging gongs added to the fears of the
two ladies, who were pale with fright.
The driver was more anxious to get his
horses out of harm's way than to loot
after his passengers, and paid no atten
tion to their frantic demands to be re
leased from their uncomfortable predica
ment.
The doors could not be budeed, so
finally one of the male prisoners let down
the window on the right side of the hack,
and with the aid of members of the big
crowd that had by this timo gathered
climbed out ana to tne ground.
The otner gentleman was too portly to
pass through the window,' so he sai still
and kept the ladies company, while his
companion learned the cause of the acci
dent. Hia report was reassuring and the
ladies recovered their composure and
calmly waited to be rescued.
By this time the horses and pole of the
carriage were out of the way and the will
ing crowd awaited directions from ths
driver as to the best method of getting the
passengers out. With the aid of the im
patient carmen the front wheels and
wrecked springs were moved forward suffi
ciently to allow the doors to be opened,
and the ladies made haste to reach the
cobbles before further complications oc
curred. After they were safe the driver
returned to his horses, with the remark
that the railroad hands could remove the
obstacle in the way of their cars if they
wanted to, and the motermen and con- i
ductors had to tug and pull and perspire
for another ten minutes before the tracks
were clear.
When the wreck, which bore the num
ber 237, but nothing to show to which
company it belonged, had been hauled to
the edge of the sidewalk the driver took
his horses away, leaving the carriage to
shift for itself. One of the passengers was
C. Bassini.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Frank Fuller Has Keturned From the
East â Entries for the Sleet at
Dixon.
Frank W. Fuller of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen, who attended the National
Assembly of the League of American
Wheelmen in company with the Cali
fornia delegates, R. M. Welch and F. H.
Kerrigan, returned from the East yester
day. He was hearty in his confirmation
of everything said by Mr. Welch in the
interview with him published in The
Call last Monday week. He said that no
consideration whatever had been shown

other States who desired divisional option
on Sunday racing. Mr. Fuller is very
much in favor of the establishment of a
Western league, and says California had
better hurry up or it will lose the Honor of
having taken the initiative, as both Il
linois and Louisiana are already taking
steps in that direction.
Nothing will be done here, however, tin
til the return of Chief Consul Kerrigan.
He is expected the latter part of tin."

OPIUM TAKES A JUMP.
The Drug Advances From Twelve
to Twenty Five Dollars
a Pound.
Special Agents Buying in Chinatown.
A Scarcity Certain Until a
New Supply.
Opium is now $25 per Bound in China
townâhigher than it has been in twenty
years past â and the prospects are that it
will advance still further before the pres
ent difficulties of the dealers and fiends in
obtaining it are over.
This state of affairs was brought about
by the action ol the special agents of the
treasury, who are investieatinj; the im
portation of the drug, in taking possession
of nearly all of the available supply in
Chinatown on Saturday nig.it iasi.
They had previously tied up all that
was stored away in the bonded ware
houses, so that there is certain to be a
scarcity until the matter is settled up or
more can be obtained from China.
The Chinese linn of CJuong Form Tai &
Co. ha 3 for years acted as the distributing
agent of the narcotic that is a life to so
many unfortunates in this City.
Though a wealthy firm, it could not
afford to buy opium on the large scale
necessary to make Dig profits, so it bought
from or imported through white lirnis that
advanced the large amount of money
needed to bring it to this port. The opium
was placed in bonded warehouses, the
supply being drawn on by Qnong Fons
lai & Co. in lots of from 500 to 1000
pounds, as it could be paid for.
This was retailed out to smokers or the
keepers of dens in lots of from five to'fifty
pounds, few of these Deing able to buy
larger lots. The firm had about 1000
pounds on band when the special agenis
induced the Collector of the Port to tie up
$300,000 to $400,000 worth in the ware
houses penainjr the result of the inquiry
as to the legality of its importation, and
they felt safe until the storm blew over.
Just to catch the right, however, they
raised the price from $12 to $15 per pound.
Then the special agents concluded that
the opium in Quong Fong Tai & Co.'s
store ought to t>e with the rest as long as
it rested under tbe suspicion of being ille
gally imported, and sent it to the Ap
praisers'store for safekeeping. This sent
the price up at $5 jumps, and there is wail
ing and gnashing of teeth among the
fiends.
