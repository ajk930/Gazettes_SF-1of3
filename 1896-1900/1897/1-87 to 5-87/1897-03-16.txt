r WASHINGTON/ D. C, March 15.â President to-day . ' sent the following mes- |
sage to Congress: ( _. . '".'..'â .â  ,t, Â« ; ' **
To the Congress of the United States: Regretting the necessity which has required me to
pai,; *rÂ»n *toÂ£Â«rhsr. I iexl assembling in extraordinary swion.is'Edfcpeasa^e bp
cÂ»>.U *J . Use <?onilJiio..itÂ» wiiku kve ;iud ,ilie ; revenues :of * the Government.*. It is conceded
that its current expenses are greater than its receipts, and that snch condition has existed
â  for now more than three years. - With unlimited means at our command, we are presenting
the remarkable spectacle of increasing our public debt by borrowing money to meet the
ordinary outlays incident upon even an economical and prudent administration of the Gov
ernment. An examination of the subject discloses this fact in every detail, and leads in
' evitably to the conclusion that a condition ot the revenue which allows that is unjustifiable,
and should be corrected.
We find by reports of the Secretary eft the Treasury that the revenues for the fiscal year
ending June 30. 1892, from all sources were Â¥425.863,260 22 and the expenditures for all
purposes were $415,953,30656, leaving an excess of receipts over expenditures of $9,914,
--453 66. During the fiscal year $40,570,467 98 was paid upon the public debt, which had
b en reduced since March 1, 1889, $255,070,890, and the annual interest decreased $11,684,
--576 1 60. : The receipts of the Government from all sources during the fiscal year ending June
3D, 1893, amounted to $461,716,561. 94, and its expenditures to $459,374,887 65, showing an
excess of receipts over expenditures of $2,341,674 29.
Since that time the receipts of no fiscal year and with but few exceptions of no month of
any fiscal year have exceeded the expenditures. The receipts of the Government from all
sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, were $372,802,498 29 and expenditures
$442,605,758 87, leaving a deficit, the first since the resumption of specie payments, of
$69,803,260 58.
Notwithstanding there was a decrease of $16,769,128 78 in the ordinary expenses of the
" Government as compared with the previous fiscal year its income wns- still not sufficient to
provide for its daily necessities, and the gold reserve in the treasury for the redemption of
greenbacks was drawn upon to meet them. But this did not suffice, and the Government then
resorted to loans to replenish the reserve. â 
In February, 1894, $50,000,000 in bonds was issued, and in November following a second
I?sue of $50,000,000 was deemed necessary. The sum of $117,171,799 was realized by the sale
of the?e bonds, but the reserve was steadily decreased until on February 8, 1895, a third sale
of $62,315,400 in binds for $65,116,244 was announced :o Congress. The receipts of the Gov
ernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, were $390,373,203 30, and the expenditures
$433,176,426 48, showing a deficit of $42,805,223 18. A further loan of $100,000,000 was
negotiated by the Government in February, 1896, the sale netting $111,163,246, and swelling
the aggregate of bonds issued within throe years to $262,315,400.
f or the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the revenues of the Government from all sources
amounted to $409,475 78. while its expenditures were $434,678,654 43, or an excess of ex
penditures over receipts of $25 203,245 70. In other words the total receipts for the three
fiscal years ending June 30, 1896, were insufficient by $137,817,729 46 to meet the total ex
o penditures. Nor has this condition since improved.
For the first half of the present fiscal year the receipts of the Government, exclusive of postal I
revenues, were $157,507,603 76, and its expeiiduu-es, exclusive of the postal service. $195,
--% 410,000 22, or an excess of expenditures over receipts of $37,902,396 46. In January of this
year. the receipts, exclusive of postal revenues, were $24,316,994 05 and the expenditures, ex
clusive of the postal service, $30,269,389 29. a deficit of $5,952,359 24 for the month.
: In February of this year the receipts, exclusive of the postal revenue, were $24,400,097 38,
and the expenditures, exclusive of the postal service, $28,796,056 66, a, deficit of $4,395,
--059 28, or a. total deficiency of $186,061,580 44 for the three years and eight months ending
March 1, 1897.
Â Not only are we without a surplus In the treasury, but with an increase in the public debt
there has been a corresponding increase in the annual interest charge from $22,893,883 20 in
1892, the lowest of any year since 1862, to $34,387,297 60 In 1896, or an increase of $11,493,
--414 40. It mar be urged that even if the revenues of the Government had been sufficient to
meet all its ordinary expenses during the past three years the gold reserve would still have
1 been insufficient to meet the demands upon it and the bonds would necessarily have been
m ssued'for its repletion. Be this as it may. it is clearly, manifested without denying or affirm-
ing the correctness of such a conclusion, that the debt would have been decreased in at least
\be amount of the deficiency and business confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout
the country.
Congress should promptly correct the existing conditions. Ample revenues must be sup
plied not only for the ordinary expenses of the Government, but for the prompt payment of
liberal pensions and the liquidation of the principal and interest of the public debt. In rais
ing "revenues duties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the home market,
so far as possible, to our own producers, to revive and increase manufactures; to relieve and
0 encourage agriculture, to increase our domestic and foreign commerce, to aid ana develop
mining and building, and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal
wages and adequate rewards to which skill and Indus :ry are justly entitled. The necessity of
the passage of a tariff law which shall provide amp revenue need not be further urged. The
imperative demand of the hour is the prompt enactment of such a measure, and to this object
I earnestly recommend this Congress shall' make 'every endeavor. Before other business is
transacted, let us first provide sufficient revenue to faithfully administer the Government
without the contracting of further debt or the continued disturbance of our finances

FIERCE RACE RIOT IN ALABAMA.
Caused by a Colored Burglar, Who Ge s
His Death-Woundâ Many Battered
Heads.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 15.â A
race riot occurred in Birmingham yester
day afternoon and wholesale bloodshed
was narrowly averted. It was brought
about by the attempted arrest of Will
Hunter, a colored man. suspected of being
the burglar who entered Eugene Giacop
pazi's house Saturday night and stole two
watches and $100.
Hunter, who was from Greenwood, Ga.,
was already under police surveillance.
Yesterday afternoon, as lie was eating his
d nner in a restaurant, Policeman William
Perdue'carne in, and placing his hand on
Hunter's snould r toiJ the latter he was
under arrest. Hunter wheeled around,
and drawing a pistol shot the officer in
the jaw and then made off. Perdue fol
lowed the negro, who ran down an alley*
and tired three shots after him, one of
which took effect in Hunter's back. The
officer tiien fell exhausted from the loss

of blood. It was afterward found that
one of the shots hit Myrtle Boland, the
rive-year-old daughter of a widow, killing
her instantly.
HunUr, after running three squares,
scaled a bacJc yara fence, and seeing an
open well jumped into it. Thcro was
ten feet of water in the well. Policeman
Fair, who had meanwhile joined in the
chase, followed the negro to the well.
Although forced to swim to teep above
water, the negro snapped at FaÂ»r. A
crowd had gathered, ami a police riot call
had brought a dozen officers to the scene.
Hunt'T was got out of the well with ropes,
but when the officers attempted to place'
him in the patrol wagon several hundred
necrroes who had gathered protested. A
large number of while men took the side
of the officers and a free right followed,
clubs and pistols being u-ed. John Craft,'
a negro, was so badly injured that he is
now in the jail hospital. In the confusion
the prisoner was hustled to the city jail,
where he died last night.
Twenty battered heads were the result
of the riot. The negroes are still much
incensed, and a strong patrol of police
men aie on duty in the affected neighbor

FRESH HORRORS IN
CRETAN WARFARE
Terrible Explosion od Board the
Russian Warship Siz i
Veliky.
Un'ess the Powers SpeeJily Check the
Pillaging Moslems the Island Will
Bs Devastated.
CANEA. Ceete, March 15.â A terrible
accident occurred to-day on board the
Russian warship Sizoi Veliky. Ti e vessel
was practicing outside of Suda Bay, when
one of her turret guns exploded, owing to
the breach not having been properly
closed. The noise of the explosion was
terrific and its results were most du
astrous.
The turret was blown to pieces and
every one of its occupants was killed.
The turret and cupola in falling killed a
number of others who were on deck. The
killed numbered rifteen, including two
officers. Thirteen men were so badly in
jured that they will die, while a number
of otners are more or less seriously in
jured.
The village of Kissamo, to the west
ward of this city, ia now in ruins from the
bombardment of the insurgents and the
fires which followed the bombardment.
The fort which guarded the village is,
however, intact, the insurgents not yet
having succeeded in lowering it, thouch
they have been firing on it for four days.
The garrison consists of only a com
The Piraeus, the Port of Athens, Threatened With a Blockade by the Allied Fleets*
pany of Tuikish infantry, but it is gal- |
htntly defending its position, though
it is surrounded by insurgents. It is
probable that it will be compelled by a |
scarcity of provisions and ammunition to j
surrender unless assistance is given to it j
by some of the foreicn warships.
There is a complete absence of author
ity here and in certain districts a state of
anarchy prevail?. In some places the in
surgents are in complete possession and]
are pillaging and outraging to their
heart's content. Unless something is
done, and that speedily, by the powers, I
the prospect is that tne island will be J
devastated.
It is reported here that it is the inten
tion of the Christians to exterminate the
Moslems throughout the island. This,
coupled with a renewal of the reports of
the massacre at Sitia, has deeply incensed
the Moslems, who, in a spirit of revenge,
I are more actively than ever engaged in
lootintr the houses of tne Christians un
der the eyes of the foreign sailors and ma
rines who were landed ;or the ostensible
p.urpose of protecting the lives and prop
erty of Christians and Moslems alike.
Many houses have been completely gut
ted of their contents.
The Moslem thieves make no pretense
of conducting their operations in secret,
but pile their booty in open spaces and
and leave some of their number to guard
j the heterogeneous mass while they go in
search of further spoils. Many of the
looters are Moslems who were rescued
from Kandamos and Seline, and their
presence in the city has proved a veritable
scourge to the Christians here.
The latter think that Sir Alfred Biliotti,
the British Consul who brought these peo
ple to a place of safety, should take some
measures to check their thieving propen
sities, but he has done nothing to protect
the Christians from their depredations.
The other Consuls likewise appear to be
[Hf produced from the Xew lorfc Herald.]
unconcerned, although appeals have been
made to all of them to stop the pillaging.
The looters reckon on being able to
escape with their booty to other parts of
the island should any.attempt be made to
take the proceedSfof their robberies from
them.
A number of Christians who had fled
from the city returned on a steamer
to-day for the purpose of getting pos
session of their belongings before they
were stolen by the Moslems.
A numerous body of Turks who had as
sembled on the quay were highly dis
pleased wi;h what they considered to be
an unwarranted interference with their
prerogative of robbery, and they drove
the Christians back, to the steamer. Sev
eral of the Christians who attempted to
make response to the on iau.;ht of the
Turks were nearly thrown into the sea.
There is a serious outbreak of smallpox
at Amoretti, and orders have been issued
for the cleanine of the town.
LONDON, BUG., March 15.â The Athens
correspondent of the Daily News tele
graphs that 6000 Greek infantry started
this afternoon for the Thessaly frontier.
There was much excitement in the city as
the troops tooK their departure, and they
were most enthusiastically cheered.

, RUSSIA'S DOUBLE GAME.
S'cretly Awaitina a Chance to Seize Con
stantinople.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 15â A special
cable dispatch from the press corre
spondent at Athens says:
I learn that secret negotiations are pro
ceeding bevween King George of Greece
and the Russian Government. This in
formation comes from a high and abso
lutely trustworthy authority. Russia un-
Qoubtedly is playing a two-laced game
with the Turkish Government and with
the powers as well.
There is an explicit understanding that
when the Greek army crosses the frontier
Russia shall find a pretext to seize Con
stantinople. The understanding so far as
King George is concerned 13 that in the
general conflict in the Balkans which is
sure to follow fighting on the frontier and
the disruption of the Turkish empire,
which would follow a seizure of Constanti
nople by the Russians, Greece is to be en
couraged to seize ; Macedonia, with the
Czar's promise in advance that she shall 1
be permitted to retain the province. ;

> WASHINGTON, D. C, March 15.â
The Hou=e of Representatives was fully
organized ; to-day by the : election of -
Speaker, clerk,' doorkeeper,', sergeant-at
.arms and other officers. It consists of 357
; members, of whom 109 ; served ;in the la?t
' Congress and 16 in former : Congresses,
while 132 have - never . served jin Congress â¢
before. Politically classified thare are 206
Republicans, 122 Democrats arid 29 fusion
s-ilverites and Populists. ; There were 341
of them present to-day. ; ' ;**. -. '
The vote of the House for the election
of Speaker was: For Keed (R.) of, Maine,
199; for Bailey (D.) of Texas,. ll4; .for-
Bell' (Pop.) of Texas, 21, and for f New
lands (Sil.) of Nevada, 1. : . .
'Mr.* Reed, having been declared duly
elected Speaker of the House for the
Fifty-fifih Congress, made a short speech
promising to perform t the duties of his
office â ; "without fear, favor or hope, of
reward, and declaring that he was ; "im
"pressed ;by j the sense . ; of responsibilty
more than cheered by the sentiment of
J thankfulness." M:f 1 ""'T' ?? ' ;i: -<' v â ' â  ; "' '" '
'Â£!>â¢ Â®fct)i of â¢' off cc was administered to
i him by Harmer^R. ) of Pennsylvania, the
I senior member ;in point of continuous
service, ana the Speaker in turn adminis
tered the oath to all the members. T-V
; On motion of Grosvenor (R. ) :of Ohio
the appointment of the following officers
was made: Alexander McDowell of Penn
i sylvania, ii'clerkp Benjamin if. Russell of
Missouri, sergeant-at-arm3j. William J.
Glenn of New York, doorkeeper; Joseph'
C. McElroy r of 'â¢ Ohio, Postmaster; Henry
M. Coaden of Michigan, chaplain.
The Democratic and Populist \ substi
tutes were formally proposed and rejected
without a division. â 
The officers â¢ thus elected had the oath
administered to them, which included the
declaration that they would not divulge
the secrets of the House. Resolutions to
notify .the â¢; Senate and President of the
organization >of the House â  were passed,
and a committee of three members to join
a like committee on the part of tie Senate
was appointed to wait upon the President.
The first hitch in the otherwise smooth
acting machinery of organization occurred
when Henderson (R.) of lowa offered a
resolution, that until otherwise ordered
the rules of the House of the Fifty-fourth
Congress be adopted as the rules of tho
House in s the Fifty-fifth Congaess, and on
this he moved the previous question. To
this another Republican member from
lowa (Hepburn) proposed an amendment
limiting the continuance of those rules 10
thirty days from the date. â 
McMillan (D.) of Tennessee asked Hen
derson indirectly whether it was the pur
i pose of the Committee on Rules to report
I a code of rules and to let the House have
an opportunity to vote upon them.
"Taere is no doubt," said: Henderson,
"that that will be done. The House will
have the fullest -opportunity to otter
amendments to the rules that will be pre
sented."
The House was counted on Henderson's
motion for the previous question and the
Speaker reported the close vote of 157 ayes2
and 158 noes. Then the Speaker an
nounced an addition of one vote to the
ayes (making it a tie), but that was imme
diately followed by an addition of one to
the noes. The vote was thereupon taken
by ayes and noes and re-tilted in ordering
the previous question on Henucrson's res
olution by 183 ayes and 152 noes, several
Republicans having changed th/r votes
from no to aye.
A point having been raided that under
the rules tcere were twenty minutes for
debate the Speaker said: "There are
rules and rules. Tliere is a rule for the
previous question in the Fifty-second,
Fifty-third" and V if ty- fourth Congresses
and also under the gÂ»nefal parliamentary
law. In the House of Representatives
heretofore the rule has allowed twenty
jninutes for debate.. But that is not the
rule under which we are now acting.
Even if it were there hÂ«is been debate
enough before the previous question to
cut off that twenty minutes. The ques
tion is now agreeing on the resolution. 1 '
The House divided and the Speaker re
ported ayes 157, noes 133, so Henderson's
resolution was aereed to.
The usual drawing for seats was pro
ceeded with, preference being given on
account of long service to Grow (R.) of
Pennsylvania, Holmun (D.) of Indiana
and Harmer (R.) of Pennsylvania. As
members selected their seats many of
their desks were made the depositories of
artistic constructions of flowers. While
this scene was being enacted to the great
amusement of the galleries, the committee
appointed to wait upon the President re
ported through Payne (R. ) of New Yori
that the President "had scut his kindly
greeting to Congress, and said that he
would communicate immediately in
writing."
The making of the report was followed
instantly â at 3:15 p. M. â by the delivery of
the President's brief message, buc its
reading was withheld until the seating of
members was completed.
The President's message was read, and
v, as referred, on motion of Dingley, to the
Committee on Ways and Means.
Dingley then introduced his tariff bill,
which was also referred to the Committee
en Ways and Means.
The Speaker announced the appoint
ment of- tne Committees on ' Rules, on
Ways and Means and on Mileage, as fol
io ws:'
On Rulesâ The Speaker, Messrs. Hendersou

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 14.â
President McKinley's proclamation con
veyed to the Fifty-fifth Congress in ex
traordinary session was read immediately
after the Senate assembled at noon to-day.:
Though the session lasted until 3:25 p. M.,
when adjournment was taken until to
morrow, the greater portion of the time j
was spent in recess waiting for the House
to organize. - -r 1 ',;
W. A. Harris (Pop.) appeared and took
the oath of office as Senator from Kansas
to succeed Peffer, but the credentials of
Henry W. Corbett, appointed by the Gov
ernor of Oregon to succeed Mitchell (the
Legislature having failed to elect) were
referred to the Committee on Privileges
and Elections.
At 3:15 p. m. the first message of Presi
dent McKinley was read. It was devoted
entirely to the tariff. The total receipts
for the past three fiscal years, he said, had
been insufficient to meet the expenditures
by $137,811,000 and the interest on the
public debt had increased by $11,493,000.
These conditions were for Congress to cor
rect. Ample revenue should be provided
for the expenses of the Government, the
prompt payment of liberal pensions and
the liquidation of the public debt. The
necessity of the hour was the enactment
of a tariff bill that would provide ample
revenues and render to labor in every field
of useful occupation liberal wages. "Be
fore the transaction of other business,"
the message concluded, "let us provide
sufficient revenue." *

DINGLEY OUTLINES
THE TARIFF BILL
Explains the General Scope
and Purport of the
Measure.
It Aims to Increase the Annual
Revenue ot the Country
$112,000,000
Home Production Will Ba Encouraged
and Employment Provided at
Good Wages.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 15.â At
quite a late hour in the session of the
House to-day Chairman Dingley pre
sented for reference to the Committee on
Ways and Means, of which it was well
understood he was again to b > chairman,
the bill upon which he and his Republi
can associates have beea engaged for many
weeks.
Most of the essential details of the bill,
except, its administrative features, which
are embodied in the last 4000 words of the
bill, beginning with section three, have
already been made known in these dis
patches; bat in discussing the general
scope and purport, of the bill to a repre
sentative of the United Associated Presses
to-day, Chairman Dingley gave an inter
esting synopsis o: what he expected of it,
r.s follows:
"The bill has two purposes, namely: To
raise additional revenue and to encourage |
the industries of the United States. On
the basis of the importations of the last
fiscal year the bill would increase the
revenue about $112,000,000, divided among
the several schedules roughly as follows:
Aâ Chemicals, $3,500,000.
Bâ Crockery and glassware, $4,000,000.
Câ Metals, $4,000,000.
Dâ Wood, *1 750.000.
Eâ Sugar, $21,750,000,
Fâ Tobacco, $7,000,000.
Gâ Agricultural. $6 300,000.
Hâ Liquors, $1,800,000.
Iâ Cottons, $1,700,000.
Jâ Jute, lineu and hemp, $7,800,000.
Kâ Wooi, $17,500,000.
Xâ Manufactures of wool, $27,000,000.
Lâ Silks, $1,500,000.
Mâ Pulp and paper, $58,000.
Xâ Sundries, $6,200,000.
"This statement is on the supposition
that the imports of each class of goods
would be the same the next fiscal year as j
in the fiscal year ended last June. But ,
as the imports of wool wÂ«re three times j
as great and those of woolen goods more ;
than twice as great in pounds as in 1893, |
the committee assumes that their ex- j
cessive importation would be largely re- j
duced by tne propo-ed bill, although the i
fact that our domestic pro iuctioa of wool !
has diminished 8,000,000 pounds since j
1893 will necessitate the importation of
much more wool.
"Assuming tnat the importations of wool
will tail off at least one-thirU from those
of 1896, on account of anticipatory im
ports to avoid duties, we place the in
creased revenue from this source at
$11,000,000. Anticipating, also, that the
imports of woolens will fall off nearly 15
per cent from the enormous imports of
1896, we estimate the increased revenue
irom tins source under the proposed rate
at about $14,000,000.
"From sugar we estimate $20,000,000 ad
ditional revenue. Anticpating a consid
erable falling off of imports of Havana to
bacco because cf the revolution in Cuba
we reduce the estimates of additional rev
enues to be derived from the tobacco
schedule to $4,000,000. The remaining
schedules will afford a revenue of about
$39,500,000 on the basis of 1896 imports of
bui as there would probab.y be dimin
ished exports at some points, although
the gradual restoration of business activ
ity wouid offset this by increasing
! the consumption of imported luxuries,
wÂ«? reduce the estimates on these to $31,
--000,000. This would aggregate an adJi- |
tional revenue of $80,000,000 the first year. I
A further reduction of hve or ten millions j
for contineencies wouid leave $70,000,000]
to $75,000,000 as the probable increased
revenue irom this bill, whicn would un
doubtedly rise to $100,000,000 the second
year.
"These estimates are below rather than
above the probable result, unless a delay ;
in the enactment of the bill should greatly
enlarge the opportunity for imports of j
articles on which duties are to be raised,
particularly with the woolens, for specu- !
lative purposes. Undoubtedly any delay !
beyond the Ist of May in placing the bill j
on the statute-books would result in a
large loss of revenue.
"'. iis increase of revenue is secured by
transferring wool, lumber, crude opium,
argola, paintings and statuary, straw
ornaments, straw mattings, burlaps and |
various other articles from the free list of
the present law to the dutiable list; by
increasing the duty on woolens; by rais
ing the duty on sugar about tbree-iourths
of a cent per pound in order
to encourage the production of
sugar in this country â which it is
believed can be done, and thus
give our farmers a new crop, which we
now import mainly from abroad; by in
creasing the duty on agricultural products
affected by Canadian competition and on
fine cotton goods; some advanced manu
factures of iron and steel, manufactures of
flax and hemp, in order to encourage them
and other industries, and especially by
increasing duties on such luxuries as
liquors, tobacco, silks and laces, etc.
"The rates of duties proposed are be
tween the rates of the tariff of 1890 and
the tariff of 1894, such reduction of rates
from the former law, preserving the pro
tective principle, being made feasib c by
changed conditions. The iron and steel
schedule is changed very little from that
schedule in the tariff of 1894, the change
being entirely in the more advanced
articles.
"The same is true of the cotton sched
ule. In the agricultural, wool and glass
ware and earthenware schedules alone are
the duties of 1890 fully restored, as a rule,
and in few cases increased with the view
of ample protection and encouraging our
larming interests at.every possible point.
"While the duty on clothing wool is
larger in proportion to the foreign value
than on manufactured articles, yet it is
thought desirable for the public interest
and for our agriculture that we should
prodnce this prime necessity for our
selves. The duty on carpet wools, as well
as upon many other articles, is imposed
mainly for revenue.
"The irritation caused by a few wools
heretofore classed as carpet wools being
used for clothing purposes has been reme
died, by transferring such wools to the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
clothing wool classes, but the duty on
clothing wools has been restored to the
rate of the act of 1890.
"In framing this new tariff the aim has
been to make the duties specific, or at
least partly specific, so far as possible, to
protect the revenue and also to protect
our own industries. This has been done
in response to the wishes of the better
class of importers, as well as of the ad
ministrators of the law and our own pro
ducers. The very great substitution of
specific duties, even where they are only
the equivalent of existing ad valorems,
will of itself increase the revenue and
strengthen the protection offered to our
industries.
"The reciprocity provisions of the act of
1890 have not only been fully restored, but
this policy has been extended by adding
to sugar, tea, coffee and hides as articles
of wnich to make reciprocal agreements
such articles as champagne. brandy,wines,
artificial and natural mineral water?, nr
gols and silk laces. In adding these
articles the reciprocity provision is
strengthened greatly by providing for a
reduction of duties on them to countries
giving us similar concessions.
"The bill, as a whole, has the unanimous
support of the Republican members of
the Wpys and Means Committee, and
will, it is hoped, receive the support not
only of Republicans but of others who be
lieve that revenue should be at least equal
to expenditures, with a small surplus
added, and who are patriotic enough to
entertain the conviction that in adjusting
duties to secure such revenue it is
wise policy to encourage home production
and manufactures and thus provide em
ployment at good wages for the laborers
of our people, upon whose purchasing
power depends the market for our pro
ductions."
The date when the new tariff is to go
into effect is named in the preliminary
diaft submitted to the House to-day as
May 1, 1597. The most important sections
taken out of their order of sequence, are

THE LATE WILLIAM DRURY.
NEW BOSTON, 111., March 15.â William Drury, the noted lacd-owner, who died
last Saturday at his' country peat, Verduretta, six miles from here, will be.buried to
morrow. The occasion will bo notable by the attendance of many old settlers of this
neighborhood, as Mr. Drnry was a veteran of Mercer County, having settled here
in 1833. He often referred with satisfaction to the fact that in those early days he
was acquainted with the Indian war chiefs KeoKuk and Black Hawk, and that
through all the troubles of the aborigines with other settlers his course toward them
was such that he always retained their friendship and respect. Mr. Drury was born
in Pickaway County, Ohio, September 17, 1809, and wa3, therefore, at his death
something over 87 years of age. He leaves s-urvivine him a widow, Mrs. Vashti Drury
(nee Williis), to whom he was married in 1840, Mr. Drury early realized the oppor
tunity for wealth that lay in the accumulation of landed property, and directed his
efforts in that direction so successfully that at tha time of his dea h he was reckoned
to be one of the largest, landholders in the United States. In addition to 6000 acres
of choice farming lands in the Mississippi Valley near this point, worth fIOO an acre,
Mr. Drury's holdings at the time of his death embraced an undivided tract of 40,080
acres near Greeley, Colo., inclosed by a fence twelve miles long and six miles w ide
He also owned extensive tracts in Indiana and Texas. Mr. Drury was one of the
first to import Percberon horses and high-bred cattle and sheep, in which business he
realized rich profits.

and it was understood that he would again
become a pewholder there, his attendance
at the Metropolitan Church being merely
a compliment to an old friend. Bishop
Newman of California, who occupied the
pulpit of his former cuaree on that day.
It is now understood, however, that the
President will i become a- member of the
Metropolitan- Church: The reason for his
change of intention, if a change has
really been made; are "â  not- known. The
Metropolitan Church is located about a
mile from ttie "White House, near, the old
City Hall, now used by the District of
Columbia Courts, in a part :of the city
that was once fashionable. Foundry
Church is about three blocks from the
White House, in the central part of the

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 15.âGov
ernor Build sent a message to tha Senate
I this afternoon announcing that he had
removed Herny French as a Trustee of the
Normal School at San Jose and statin jj that
French hid been attempting to induce the
State Printer and certain officials of the
Legislature to blockade Bulla's Senate bill
495. providing for a chance of trustee* on
July 1, 1897. The Governor complained
that the bill bad been sent to him twice
with 1897 chenged to 1899. The following
is the message:
Executive Department. {
State of California.)
â¢ To the Honorable the Legislature of the State of
Californiaâ GEHiLEyiKS: On February 25 by a
vote of 29 to 1 Senate bill 494 was passed by
the Senate. On March 4, upon Its considera
tion by the Assembly, it was amended, and on
.. Starch 8, by a vo:e of 45 to 5, it passed that
body iS amended. On March 9by a vote of 39
to 0 the Senate refused to concur In the Assem
bly ninendments, and on Man 11 by * vote
of 17 to 7 the . Assembly receded therefrom.
'I lie bill was returned from the House to the
'Sepate and ordered to enrollment. On March
12 what purported to be Senate bill 494 was
handed to the presiding officers and chiof
clerks of your two bodies as duly enrolled and,
therefore, was by them certified to me. The
document certified to me, -however, was not
Senate bill 494 as it passed, but contained pro
visions not contained in the true bill and had
it been approved as certified to me the result
would have been that the bill as passed would
have been "killed."
This fact being brought to the attention of
. the proper officers, a second document pur
porting to be the said Senate bill was trans
mitted to this office, but not accepted as it was
iouud not to be the true bill, or the bill as
passed. Later Senate bill 494 as it passed was
proDeriy dtXfrexed to this office.. 'J, , .' . â  ...
in viewfof these facts and. of certain com
i munications which 1 transmit to you, 1 desire
A to recommend that your honorable bodies,
under a suspension of the rules, pass a bill
making it a felony, with the severest penalty,
fur any person to directly or indirectly write,
.telegraph, telephone or in any manner ap
proach one of the officials through whose
hands ft bill must pess, requesting that official
to blockade that bill or to use his position to
kill the same, or to take any part for or against
any measure before tnt Legislature. The Leg
islature itself, which passes all bills, is the
. proper body-to which appeals should be made,
and if appeals are permitted to be made to
the clerks of said bodies, or persons who may
control. or be employed in the printing of bills,
that a bill be blockaded or killed by '.hem,
methods may te introduced unknown to the
laws for the defeating of measures after their
pjssape.
. It Is now a felony to alter a bill; it should be
a felony for any clerk, or employe of your
honorable bodies to lobDy for a bill, or for any
person to suggest that they In any manner
take part in legislative proceedings other
than in the proper discharge of their duties.
Hud the bill in question been delivered later
in the session, or the under remained undis
covered, even the signature of the Governor j
would not. have made law of the measure |
which your honorable bodies so almost unani
mously passed. The change of a word or a
phrase In the printing of a bill may under our
constitution blockade and kill it.
On March 3 Henry French of San Jose tele
graphed to the State Printer as follows:
Ha.v Josk, Cal., March 3, 1897.
A. X Johnston (personal), Stale Printer, Sacra
mento: Blockade As.-* nib y bill 68H and Senate

On the same day he sent an identical tele
gram to Mr. Brandon, chief clerk of the Senate.
Neither of these gentlemen, however, com
plied with his request or blockaded the bill.
Thereafter Mr. Jotmstor. Superintendent of

lowing letter:

Confer with State Printer Johnston. Can't trust

The letter to Mr. Johnston contained the
language ''I know you are in a position to kill
. these bills" and "See Frank Brandon; I think
he will do anything he can confidentially,"
and the letter to Mr. Brandon the word",
"Now, 1 don't expect you to jeopardize any
thine by makina nn open ii?ht," but "I know
jnu are in a position to kill them if you want
to," and the fact appears from his letter to Mr.
J> hnstou that he was in correspondence on
the snme subject with Jonn Yarcoe, the enroll
ing e'erk of the Assembly.
The State Printer was :;: no manner to blame
for t hu changes In biil 494 that would huve
"killed" it, uor was Mr. Brandon. The fact
remains, however, that the bill was twice so
dealt with after it hnd been propeny passed
and that it contained matters therein inserted
which wou:a most eil'ctually have killed it
had the error not been d scovered.
The danger of the iiefent of deserving meas
ures during the closing days of the session
would be so very easy oy such methods that
every safeguard should be thrown around
them. The heaviest penalties should be at
tached to any secret confidential request made
of the officers hauuling them to interest them
selves in huv manner whatever in their defeat.

Yinlattd n I'roitiiie.
SACKAME.VTO, Cal., March 15.â The
reading of the Governor's message in the
Assembly created us much interest as it
did in the Senate, as:d when Private Sec
retary McCabe had concluded its leading
Chairman Coombs said:
"In relation to the communication just
received from the executive I think this
House should take some action without
delay, as a very serious charge has been
made against one of the clerks of the
House. It should be investigated.
"There should also ba a joint committee
appointed for the purpose of framing a
biil which may carry out the suggestion
of the executive."
Wright of Alameda said that he would
draw up a bill to cover the matter.
Price of Sonoma introduced a resolu
tion to the effect that a special committee
of three should be_ appointed by the
Speaker to fully investigate the matter, in
so far as it related to the Assembly or any
persons under its control.
Speaker Coombs appointed Price,
Wright and Bridgford as the committee.
John Varcoe, the enrolling clerk of the
Assembly, came in alter the report was
read and was considerably surprised, as
Senate bill 494 had never been in his
hands.
Senate bills are not handled by him at
all. He informed a Call reporter that
Governor Budd bad this morning de
manded from him a dispatch which he
(Varcoe) had received from Henry French.
Varcoe replied that the dispatch was per
sonal and private and that he would not
show it until he had gained permission
from the author.
When the committee met in the even
ing Varcoe produced two dispatches and a
letter, the only communications he had
ever received from the French. The first
dispatch reads as follows:
BAH Jose, Cal., March 9, 1897.
John Varcoe {personal) Sacramento, Cal.:
Please wire me latest point on Assembly bill
688 and Senate bill 494. What U their pres
ent position? Is there a probability of their
passage? Have they been amended or not?
Answer paid. Henry French.
The second dispatch is dated March 11
and rea is as follows:
Is there probability of Senate bill 494 be
coming law. Wire answer immediately. If
j amended send copy. Please mail mo histories
from bo;h houses to-day and write me full
particulars. Is Assembly bill 088 dead be
yond hope of resurrection? Henry French.
Slate Printer Johnston was called be
fore the committee and testified that on
March 3 he received a dispatch from
Henry French, and seeing that it con
tained an improper suggestion, he showed
it to tne secretary of tne Senate and an
other person for his own protection.
He received a letter, also, and these
two he handed to Governor Budd, who
promised to return them to Mr. Johnston
in the afternoon, but he had not done so.
Mr. Johnston did not know Mr. French
personally. He might have met nim
once, but he was not acquainted with
him.
Frank Brandon, Secretary of the Senate,
said that the face of the bill showed a
clerical error, said error being the neglect
to stamp "receded from' 1 on onn of the
amendments. Hence it was printed with
the bill when it should have been omitted.
"As a matter of fact," continued Bran
don, on the subject of changing the
phraseology of bills, "the clerks of both
Houses and the gentlemen in positions
under them find very often errors in
amendments, sometimes of such a kind
that they will give the bill a nonsensical
{ reading.
' I make it a point where anything is
! discovered by the clerk that, does not seem
right, we aim to go to the member who
has made the error and ask him to correct
it, at the same time pltcing their initials
on the Argin.
"It wWild cost the State $20,000 some
sessions to correct those bills if the clerks
did not discover the errors before they
went to the printer. In one bill we found
seventeen mistakes. That bill but for us
would have bad to be printed seventeen
times, 500 copies each time, if we had not
called the attention of the members to
them."
The material error was the change of
the date when the new board should be
appointed from 1897 to 1890. The latter
year was an amendment which bad been
receded from and which had not been
canceled or stamped by the clerk of the
Senato desk. Hence the date in the bill
as printed was "1899 "
Chief Clerk Duckworth of the Assembly
was examined respecting the amendments
made by the Assembly to Senate bill 494.
Assembly bill ÃB3 was withdrawn because
it wrs identical in language with Senate
bill 494. All the amendments adopted in
the Assembly were receded from at the
request of the Senate.
John Varcoe said that the Governor had
informed him that when the bill was sent
to the printer it did not show that the
! amendments were receded from. The bill
in th* hands of the committee Dore the
stamp with tlw name of the secretary of
the S;nate.
Secretary Brandon was recalled and
said the clerk of the Assembly had inad
vertently neglected to mark acros me
face of two amendments the words
"receded from," and Mr. Brandon in the
Governor's office in the presence of the
Governor and others, wrote in pencil,
"receded from March 11 â Brandon."
On another amendment on the same oc
casion he had penciled "receded from,"
and had forgotten to sign his name..
Mr. Brandon added that Assembly En
rolling Clerk John Varcoo was as innocent
of any wrongdoing as a man in South
Africa, because the enrolling clsrk of the
A sembly is not allowed to handle Senate
bills at all. Mr. Brandon said that he
was not able to fix whose fault it w.ns. flttK
Price asked whether if these things had
b'- y en properly indorsed "receded from,"
would the Senate enrolling clerk have
made the same error that he dia make?
Mr. Brandon declined to say. That was
for tho committee to decide.Mr.Price asked
Mr. Brandon to produce the letter received
by him from Mr. French. Mr. Brandon
refused. "My letter," he said, "was given
to the Governor under circumstances and

conditions which I don't care to violate.
"Mr. French and I have been friends for
twenty years. His family das been ex
ceedingly kind to my children, and I
think my confidence lias been betrayed."
"By whom? By the Governor?" asked
"Well, in this communication of the
Governor you can draw your own conclu
sions. Governor Budd asked me 10 show
him tlic letter and the telegram which
were directed to me as a confidential com
munication after Mr. Johnston had volun
tarily produced the letter and the tele
gram which he received.
The postscript said that he should see
Mr. Brandon, who would do whatever he
Bight suggest. I handed the letter to
Governor Budd with the understanding
that he should take a copy and not the
original.
Furthermore, my name was not to be
u-ed. I was astounded when I found that
my letter was put into print and sent to
the Senate to-day.
The understanding between the Gov
ernor and myself was that whatever com
munication might pass between the Gov
ernor and the Legislature my name
would not be used.
Price insisted that Brandon should
hand the letter and the telegram to the
committee and Brandon complied with
the request. They were as puolished in
the Governor's message.
Brandon told how Jdiss Todman had
gone up to the Senate chamber and re
quested him to step down into the Gover
nor's office.
There he found the Governor and the
Lieutenant-Governor and the letter and
telegram were asked for. Governor Budd
promised that he would not use Bran
don's name in iho letter or in the tele
gram.
"The Governor showed me a paper with
hi: name signed to it," added Brandon,
'â¢and said, 'This settles the son of a ,
I guess. 1
Clerk Duckworth said the practice was
to put t lie amendments with the bill, with
history of the bill on the bacK. The his
tory explained all about the amendments
and their statuv
It was the tirst time that he had ever
seen the words "receded from' 1 written on
an amendment. lie had made no agree
ment with Mr. Brandon to so mark the
amendments before this present trouble.
Duckworth contradicted tne testimony
of Brandon on the point that this was the
first instance in wnich the Assembly had
receded from an amendment. There were
countless instances of recessions to he
found in the journal.
He bad not received any letters or dis
patches from Henry French daring the
present session.
John Varcoe, enrolling clerk of the As
sembly, produced the telegramsas printed
in this article and a letter of similar pur
port.
Varcoe saw French in San Jose on Feb
ruary 22, and French asked him to tell
the Santa Clara delegation that te would
like very much to have the bill defeated.
The wittness talKed with the Santa Clara
delegation and some others about the bill
and against the bill.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 15.â Asano,
president of the new Oriental steamship
line which is to ply between Japan and
the United States, was in the city yester
day. Mr. Asano has been in Europe look
ing after the business of his company.
He was accompanied yesterday by H.
Koybayashi and A. Kondo, business as
sociates. He was reticent about his busi
ness in this city, but it was learned th.it
while here he consulted with Charles H.
Cramp, the well-known shipbuilder, and
various railroal otficiais regarding the
traffic connections.
A-ano has been negotiating with the
Santa Fe line for a traffic arrangement,
but this is said to have foiled. The cause
given is that the Santa Fe terminals are
at San Diego and this harbor is not large
enough to accommodate the ship* which
will be used. Saturday night Asano dined
with Coilis P. Huntingdon and talked the
matter over with him as far as Mr. Hunt
ington's road, the ; Southern ; Pacific,
wits concerned. It was - said V yesterday
that a traffic . arrangement had practi
cally been . agreed upon between the

Instructs His Attorney to Sus for
Damages if an Action Can Be
Sustained
SACRAMENTO, Cai*, March 15.â The
opening of the last week of the thirty-sec
ond session of the Legislature showed a
plentiful supply of vacant chaiis parti
cularly in the Assembly, many of the
members being away on leave of absence
and others having taken French leave to
be hauled back in a very disagreeable
manner by a Deputy Sergeant-at-aims on
a call of the House.
Tbe exhibition of Mr. Hearst's bogus
gold-brick telegram from "Bert," some
body informing "Blodgett," somebody
in Bakersfield, "that $3000 would save
Bert on reconsideration," has provoked
only ridicule and contempt on the
part of the Assembly. Some pity is felt
for Mr. Hearst by his Democratic "well
wishers because of the merciless manner
in which he is being bunkoed by Long
Green; the bogus telegram, which could
prove nothing if genuine, having cost him
about $250 if rumor is to be believed.
There are a whole lot of worthless and
faked "telegrams" for sale on that and
other bills, but since Mr. Hearst's $250
was paid for the "Bert" telegram the
price has risen to $275 and $300.
It is seldom that the merchants in
bogus telegrams come across so soft a
thing as Willing Willie.
Assemblyman Power has demanded of
the Examiner correspondent that he
charge him directly with the giving or re
ceiving of money. This would give him
an opportunity of beginning action for
libel. He also informed the Examiner
representative that ho would break his
jaw if he came to him again with insult
ing questions.
Power has written to his attorney in
San Francisco to peruse the Examiner
articles very carefully with the view of
bringing an action for heavy damages for
libel.
"I told the Examiner reporter that he
was a liar," said Power to a Call reporter I
this evening, "and that he was trying to
crawl into a hole because he was forced to
deny that I had made the statements
which he had caused to be published in 1
his fake paper. I told him that it the Ex- I
aminer had any charges to make aeainst j
me it should have manhood enough to !
come out and charge me directly with a
crime.
"Just as soon as I saw that piece in tbe I
Kx.iminer I telegraphed to my father the j
following:
BACKAMENTO. March 13.
James Power, Sqn Francisco: Th> Examiner
fake yarn Is false right through. You kuow I
have too much respect for you to do anything
to disgrace you. John Power.
"I also telegraphed in the same way to
Noian Brothers, my employers. The Ex
aminer has made no charge, and there- j
fore there can be no investigation. It has j
merely insinuated, in a cowardly, under
handed, sneaking way. as it does about I
every boay. Let it but make a charge, and
I shall be the first to demand an investi
gation."
Late thisevening Power announced that
in the morning he would rise to a ques
tion of privilege and demand an investi
gation into the insinuations made by the
Examiner.
TO SUCCEED DAN COLE.
Major Patrick Harney Appointed a Mem

SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 15.â This
afternoon the Governor sent to the Senate
for confirmation the name of Major P. J.
Harney of San Francisco to be Harbor
Commissioner, vice Â«Dan T. Cote, term ex

Rudolph Harold was a : s> nominated to
succeed F. S. Chadbourne.
Major Patrick J. Harney is well known
on the water-front. Many years ago he
served a term as wharfinger at Jackson
street wharf, and later was assistant ad
jutant- general under Governor Irwin's
administration. Upon the expiration of
his term in the latter capacity he became
bookkeeper in the United States Sub-
Treasury, but gave up that position to be

tation Company, whose boats run to and
from Sacramento carrying produce. A
year ago he was appointed Port Warden
by Governor Budd and has retained bnh
positions up to the present time. Who
will succeed film as Port Warden is an
open question, but the chances are that
the appointment will be made to-day.
As Major Harney is in Sacramento it
cannot be learned whether he will retain
his position as agent for the California
Transportation Company, but people who
know him assert that he will not, as it
would not do for him to be constantly
passing as Harbor Commissioner upon the
bills of the corporation which he repre
sented.
HI BULK I' ICO TESTS.
D'clarr* that Senator &eau)*ll It Per-
KOnnllit lntTritrd in a Mill.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 15.- Dib
ble caused a sensation in iba House tbis
afternoon when Seawell's Senate bill 113
came up on a second reading.
"This bill," said Dibble, "was intro
duced for the purpose of enabling a cer
tain lawyer to win a particular case. 1
had hoped that he would have the decency
not to attempt to pass this bill."
Dibble explained that Barclay Henley,
a constituent of his, was the lawyer on the
otner siae. He read extracts from letters
received by him from Mr. Henley. The
following is an abstract:
''You will see that the bill says that
after five years no execution shall issue
on a judgment unless it has been reviewed
by soir.e appropriate proceeding. Mark
the obscurity of that language. What do
they mean by that? It Is impossible for
human being to tell. It is simply in
tended to cloud the subject with obscure
phrases in the hope t but it will be con
strued to be a molification of the lan
guage of section 685, which they have at
â¢emptocl to modify by the preceding bill.
The attempt is one that the Assembly
ought to sit down on very sharply, be
cause it is f inhered in duplicity and is
only intended to effect the purpose of a
lawyer, who is seeking to put it through
for his own individual gains."
In another letter Henley says:
"Thepuriione of Senatorl3eawell is to
affect a Jaw suit now pending in which he
is personally interested and is on attor
ney. The facts are that in a certain case,
Wheeler vs. Eldred, in Mendocino County,
a foreclosure suit was commenced and a
decision rendered. The defendant in the
foreclosure suit then, by his attorney, in
stituted injunction proceedings on various
grounds to stop the sale of the property.
"By dilatory tactics they tied up the ex
ecution until five years had expired. We
then applied for an execution and the
litigation that is now pending has arisen
out of that application.
"There is no kind of propriety in it,
and if it passes it Bhould be with an
amendment such as I have heretofore
sent to Judge D;bDle and Judge Bridg
ford, which provides that the bill snal!
not affect matters that are now pending." j
Caminetti raised the point of order that
it was not proper to read private letters
in the discussion of a bill, but Speaker
Coombs ruled the point of order not well
taken.
San ford spoKfi in favor o! the bill.
The amendments were voted down and
the bill went to the third reading file.
ALARM IN MILITARY CIRCLES.
Foreign Governments Already in Posses
sion of the Plans of Uncle Sam's
Fortifications,
CHICAGO, 111., March 15.â A special
to the Inter Ocean from New York says:
Alarm is felt In military circles over the
belief that the order promulgated to the
army by Major-General Miles on March
8, that none but the olh'cers in the service
or those associated with fortifications snail
be yiermitted to visit the lake or coast de
fenses of the United States, has come too
Jate to accomplish the purpose intended.
In other words, the foreign Govern ments,
which it sought to hold in ignorance of
our plans of National defense, are already
in possession of the information.
For years it has been a matter of little
difficulty for visitors 10 cain entrance to
any of the defenses of the United States,
and the army officers in charge of the
works at forts Hamilton, Wadswortb,
Schuyler and Willets Point have been
particularly amicable in this regard.
Permits were not needed or asked for
and a a ranger was seldom molested or
asked what his business was. Writers for
the press, photographers in the employ of
the magazines and others were permitted
to come mid go almost at will and left un
disturbed to take copious notes and pic
tures of the works. The result has been
that the knowledge thus obtained has
been spread broadcast and the people of
the United States have probably a more
thorough knowledge of the defenses of
their Government than the citizens of any
other country have of theirs.
It Is not the practice of the British Ad
miralty, while English diplomatists are
getting black in the face irom shouting
hysterically for peace and arbitration, to
tecall their si ies or dismiss their experts
who keep tab 0:1 the growth of the armies
and navies of their rivals.
It is said on good authority that Eng
land has a more thorough knowledge of
our coast defenses than any other Eur
pean power. Be that as it may, the new
order of things will prevent any civilian
from visid;)g any of the many works of
National defense about New York. The
order not only applies to the defenses on
the seacoast, but to those on the great
lakes.

There Was No Foundation

Libel.
Legislators, Incuding Braunhart,
Testily Before the Senate
Committee.
Their Evidence C;uses the Utter
Collapse of the Most Shameless
of Fak?s
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 15.â 1n or
<ier to throw discredit on the Senate
bribery investigating committee the mon
arch of a thousand lakesâ shameless and
impudent still, in the face of the chastise
ment two of its faKing attaches have suf
fered â has been asserting that the com
mittee would made a vicarious sacrifice of
Senator Braunhart in order to further
punish the managing faker of the news
paper proscribed by decent people through
out the country.
It was stated that on the supposition
that Braunhart was the fountain head of
the baseless rumors on which the Exam
iner's stupendous and silly fake of Febru
ary 27 was published he would be baited
by the committee. This unmanly fline
was taken up by those who would evi
dently have liked to see ?uch an out
come, and was magnified into a report
that the expulsion of Braunhart was not
unlikely.
The whole fabric of this much-inflated
sensation collapsed and was torn into
shreds at the session of the committee to
night, when Senators Shine, Denison,
Braunhart, Pedlar and Bert were exam
ined.
Shine ten ified that he heard rumors
after the passage of the bill that corrupt
means had been used. He did not remem
ber that he had overheard what Senator
Braunhart said to Senator Doty immedi
ately after the passage of Assembly biil
273 by the Senate. He had heard tho ru
mors on the street and at the Golden
Eagle Hotel, but he could not remembr
the name of any person with whom he had
talked en the subjeci.
Senator Denison knew absolutely noth
ing regarding corrupt means to influence
any one in his vote on the till.
Senator Braunhart testified much in
line with Shine. To questions as to
whether or not he had given any informa
tion to the reporters of the Examiner on
which the article of February 27 was based
he returned positive denials. He had
heard only rumors and had simply re
peated these, he said, to his ;ellow Sena
tors as others had done. He could throw
no light of any kind on the subject, nor
give any information that would aid the
committee in its investigation.
Neither Pedlir nor Bert had anything
new or interesting to communicate.

STATE PRINTING
IS THE SUBJECT
Governor Budd Ssnds a
Lengthy letter to
Dickinson.
Reviews the Many Complaints
H; Has Made to Mr.
Johnston.
Expresses Surprise That the Inv sti
gators Found ; the 0 fi:e So
Well Conducted.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. March Gov
ernor Budd sent the following letter to
day to Senator Dickinson, chairman of
the Printing Investigating Committee,
now in session going over the report of
the experts:
Fxecutive Department, {
Sacramento. Cal., March 13, 1897.
. Hon. John 11. Dickinson, Chairman Investigat
ing Committee, Etc., Sacramento, Catâ Dear Sir:
Since answering your letter of March 3 I have
received another letter from your committee
of date March 9, to which at this, the earliest
possible moment, I nope you will permit me
to reply. In this letter, which requests from
meC2rtain evidence, and request* my co-op
eration in the investigation now in progress
before you, you recite that you have discov
ered no "evidence tending in any way to sup
port the charges" which I have made against
the Superintendent of State Priming in my
veto message of February 9 last. I am sur
prised that you should regard the evidence
already in your possession so lightly, and in
. this connection would call certain facts to
your attention.
I complained in my veto message that sec
tion 531 of the Political Code requires the
â uperintendent to make a report to the Gov
ernor "embracing a record of the complete
transactions of his office," "which report shall
show in detail all the items of expense at
tending the State printing, and all the ex
penses of the office," and that the superin
tendent had failed to make the report required
by that section. Yon hare the report and you
nave the law. Ordinari y the fact that the
report did not comply with the law might be
deemeJ some "evidence tending in' any way
to support the charges." ;
I complained that the superintendent pre
sented a payroll for labor perlormcd for the
time from July 1 to July 18, 1896. Attached
to this payroll was a sworn statement that the
services were actually rendered "in the man
ner and on the dates as above stated, and that
the services herein mentioned were actually
rendered. 1 ' Mr. Johnston's foreman, Mr.
Thorp, has admitted, before your committee,
that the statements made in this affidavit
were not correct. Mr. Johnston's affidavit is
on file with the Controller, and the facts are
' before you. This is some evidence.
I stated that Mr. Johnston had failed to
make application to the Board of;Exiiminers
lor permission to incur a deficiency, as he is
specifically required by law to do, and I trans
mitted with my veto a copy of his letters, from
which the truth of this statement appears, and
these letters are printed in the Assembly
Journal of February 9 last.
â¢ 1 stated that his recent official report to me,
dated September 15, 1896. shows that for the
'.fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, he nad ex
pended n| the appropriation for the support
of his office $146,000 59, or more than one
half of his appropriation, and in addition had
used stock on hand to the value oi $12,085 76,
nutkin? the totsi expenditure lor the year
$158,086 35. aid that he claimed to have done
less than $95,000 worth of work. Mr. John
ston's own report of that date is before you,
Rnd on its face bears indisputable evidence of
tne truth of this statement. This is more evi
dence supporting my charges.
1 am informed that when Mr. Johrston was
before your committee, and was asked to ex
plain this great discrepancy, he testified under
oath that his report to the Governor was not
correct in its statement of th amount of
money used for the work and materials of the
forty-seventh fiscal year.
I further understand that Mr. Johnston tes
tified that he had expended of the appropria
tion made for the forty-seventh and forty
eighth fiscal years' for labor done, materials
purchased and indebtedness incurred during
the latter part of the forty-sixth fiscal year
about 000.
It is possible that your committee has over
looked the mil import of this admission.- It
conclusively shows that the Superintendent of
Sate Printing created a deficiency during the
forty-sixth ti>cal year, and endeavored to in
cur an indebtedness in violation of plain pro
visions of law. No provision of our law is
more plainly expressed than this, that no of
ficer "in the service of the State shall have
power to create any deficiency in exces3 of any
appropriation of money made by law," except
upon the unanimous written consent of the
Governor. Attorney-General and Secretary of
State, and any indebtedness attempted in vio
lation of this requirement "shall be absolutely
> null and void," and shall not be "paid out of
any State appropriations." â¢
When the Superintendent of State Printing
used this sum of about $28,000 out of the ap
propriation specifically lor the forty-seventh
and forty-eighth fiscal years to pay
.an Indebtedness incurred in the forty
-8 xth fiscal year, in direct violation of
law, he caused a misappliance of the funds set
apart lor the support of his office
for said forty-seventn and forty-eighth
fiscal years, paying out of an appro
priation for that time a debt unlawfully con
tracted at a previous time, and which the law
in express languace provided should . not be
"paid out of any State appropriation." When
you add to that In order 10 have accom
plished this Mr. Johnson must have made an
oath to the State Board oi Examiners as to the
correctness of the claims, and that they were
for work, labor and materials furnished and
done in the 47th fiscal year, you might be said
to have some "evidence tending in any way
to support the charges." ..
The records of the Controller's office will
show that Mr. Johnston's claims did not state
' that they were for indebtedness incurred, as
he stated, in the forty-sixth fiscal year, and
that if money was drawn for that purpose it
was without the knowledge of the Controller
and in violation of law. .1 annex a letter from
the Hon. E. P. Colgan, State Controller, in
reply to my. inquiry into this question, which
is self explanatory.
It is useless to expect any conflict between
the Controller.- figures and the Printer's for
expenditures, as the former are based on the
, sworn statements ot the latter.
: : Mr. Johnston has frequently attempted to
explain any irregularities which might have
appeared in the management of his office by
Baying that no money was drawn from his ap
propriation except upon claims allowed by the
'State Board of Examiners. When it is recalled
that the only evidence before the board lor its
Information is the sworn statement of that
gentleman and when you thus rind that affi
davits of this character and of the character of
the affidavit attached to the payroll of July 1
to July 18, 1896, are known to have been
made you will realize how little check there is
upon the expenditure of the vast sum bien
nially appropriated for the support of the
State Printing Office. . â  . j
Another statement I made in roy veto mes
sÂ»Â«;e was that the State Board of Educationâ
which, under the law and constitution, has
the right to order priiued the school text
booksâ an order directing the Superin
tendent to print no more copies of a certain
grammar until the further order of the board
This order was one which they had authority
to mane, and which it was the Superintend
ent's duty ie obey, and any Â» responsibility
for its observance rested alone upon the Board
of Education. Mr. Johnston admits to you that
he violated this order of the authority which
the law and the constitution placed above him
and printed 10,000 copies of the forbidden
grammar, with the result that he has nearly
8000 copies on hand and unused.
, I also charged that he had; paid a higher
price lor coal- than ; was necessary, and wnen
before your committee he testified he had paid
higher prices for coal than had been paid for
coal purchased under contract by other ate
officers, but that â  the reason he had done so
was that the coal he | purchased | had a greater
. steam and power producing capacity than the
con tract coal. The fact remains that the coal
which was being bought under contract at a
less rate than he was paying. brings a higher
price in the general market' and later, when
bids were received for both varieties, the coal
for which the Kuperintendent was paying tne
higher price was offered at a lower i rate than
the other ; variety and both materially lower
than the cheaper variety. >. .â ;â â¢
1 stated the circumstances attending the
contract he made for an electrical plant. This
contract was improperly entered into, and the
lacts attending it arid the improprieties with
w hich it was surrounded can easily be discov
er, d and verified by the secretary of the
Bonrd of Examiners, by the Hon. L. H. Brown
and by the propiietors, managers or employes
of elect r eal companies in Sacramento.
My statement regarding Mr. Taylor and the
information he had given me was amply
verified by that gentleman in his sworn state
ment-! before you, and you must remember
that Mr. Johnston has borne strong testimony
as to the capacity and ability of Mr Tavlor.
1 charged that the cos; of public printing in
this State was all out of proportion to its
amount and was much more expensive than
the printing In other States. Tne figures to
verify this s.atement are at your command,
bs is the L braiy bulletin oi New York, where
the figures are tabulated and compared, and
you can with equal facility verify my state
ment that the statement Mr. Johnston made
to me of the printing done for my predecessor
was incorrect.
In your communication to me you state that
you deem it essential to the performance ol
your duty, and to a full and complete investi
gation of the matter you are charged with in
vestigating, that you should be placed in the
full possession of all evidence of every charac
ter relating to this mailer. Â»>nd Â«s you asked
my co-operation, I would suggest that you ex
amine the Superintendent of State Piinting
and his employes, in detail, as to the state
ments in mv message, and that you procure
experts to determine why an expenditure of
$146,000 produced on.y $04,000 worth of
work, and to learn the capacity of the pretses,
compositors andother employes and machines',
and to determine as to the number of persons
necessary to operate the machines and do the
work, and if the number employed was greater
than the capacity of the machines and the de
mands of the institution would justify.
You might examine the payroll and deter
mine if there was any increase in the number
ot persons employed immediately before or
after the holding of political primaries or
conventions or immediately before an flection.
The expert might then report if the work or
dered at these times, or the work actually per
formed at such times of full roll?, justified the
increased employment. Some "evidence tend
ing in any way to support the charges" might
then be discovered.
You might submit orders which have been
executed at the State Printing Office to any
leading San Francisco houses which do not
deal with that office and get their estimates as
to what they wou id do the work for.
To a perfectly unprejudiced mind it might
be regarded as a circumstance tending to sup
port my charg-s that extravagance was prac
ilced in that i.ffice, that the payroll or' the first
eight weeks oi the present session exceeded
the payroll for the corresponding time of the
last session by nversl4,ooo, and this although
you had simplified the method of legislative
printing.
You might inquire why the superintendent
had never giv^'u the Governor the statement
required by the Political Code, and why, in
answer to all inquiries of this office, he has
given only the unsatisfactory statements con
tained in "the appendix to my veto message,
and you might renew to him the questions
which he has as yet neglected to answer to
me. You might also ask him why, in givine
me a statement of the work he had done for
Governor Markham, he omitted so many
items, and whether Â»uch omissions were will
ful, or the result of improper bookkeeping.
And the fact that he haa to change the figures
on his books by nearly $10,000 to make them
balance in the foriy-iourth fiscal year, might
further enlighten you.
I might call your attention to the report of
the Assembly Committee on Commissions, Re
trenchments and Pubic Expenditures, which
was submitted February 11, 1897. In this re
port the committee states that in the books
and in c Hints of the State Priming Office they
found an "apparent irregularity" for whicn
they, after examining Mr. Johnson, his book
ktep-.T and his foreman, wore unable to give a
reason. They further ieported "that in the
matter of the public <tion of State documents
the method is of such character as tends to
unnecessary expenditure of State money ; that
the so-cmied 'Legislative printing' account is
loosely conducted," etc. This committee was
enabled, after two days' investigation, to dis
cover irregularities in thy superinter dent's
accounts, and that tbe State moneys were un
necessarily expended in that office, and its
members mignt, If appealed to, supply you
with some "pvidetic-; tendiug in any wav to
support the charges" of irregularities in this
office and its accounts and management.
I will apain state that the extreme press of
official business has prevented me taking part
in the investigation which you Â»re conduct
ing, and which I deemed you fully competent
to successfu.iy conduct. In view of the grave
case which the record discloses, I cannot ac
count for your statement that you have dis
covered nothing, and submit ii the facts set
forth above do not constitute "evidence tend
ing i;i any way to support the charges" I made
in my veto message, then these charges could
not be sustained by any evidence. Yours re
spectfully, Ja>les H. BrDD. Governor.
P. S. â Since finishing the above I understand
that an "incomplete report" of the printing
experts snows that while they are unable from
lack of time to make a thorough Investigation
or, as they say, "to go into the subject thor
oughly and do it properly, we decided to deal
with the work intrusted to us in a general
manner, and see If by our recommendations
wo could improve the methods in vogue in
some parts of the establishment, and thereby
save unnecessary expenditure existing under
the present condition*," and they concluded
as follows:
"If the foregoing recommendations are
adopted and properly enforced we estimate
LARGEST BOY IN THE WORLD.
SALINAS, Cal., March 15.â A recent boast of a New Jersey newspaper that the little Eastern
State has the largest schoolboy in the worldâ a lad of 17 years, whose height is 6 feet 4 inchesâ
has brought to light the fact that Saliaas has a baby giant that puts the Jersey big fellow to
shame for his dwarfish stature.
John Bardin, a baby-faced and very modest lad of 15, attends the Salinas Grammar Bchool
every day, where he plays like any little fellow in knickerbockers, yet he is C feet 5J^ inches In
height and weighs 220 pounds. He walks rapidly, though given slightly to stooping, a habit
common to many very tail men, who seem eager to thus curtail part of their stature.
In the accompanying drawing young Bardin is shown standing beside a 17-year-old lad of
ordinaiy size. He is head and shoulders above his companion.
The boy-giant ot Salinas is a deceiving study. When one first meets him it seems impos
sible to believe he is so large, for his actions are very childish, and he is so well proportioned,
except for rather narrow, round shoulders, that his great proportions are not apparent. Yet
when Bardin stands by a 200-pound man with a che-t measurement of 40 inchet it Is at once
apparent that the boy is a giant. He has grown nearly art inch in height during the past
nine months, and he fears he will rtow fully five inches more before he reaches maturity.
This remarkable boy's father, William Bardin, was a man about 5 feet 8 inches in height,
and he did not weigh over 140 pounds. His mother is a woman of medium size, but her
parents were very large people. Her father was Gsneral James Collins. He was 6 feet 3 inches
in height and weighed 250 pounds. His wife was also very large, so that young Bardin seems
to come by heredity to his great and promising stature.
"Benches und desks are not made for big fellows like me," he said a few days ago, "and It
is very awkward to be so big."
Young Bardin is probably the largest boy of his age in the world, and his good health and
rapid growth are likely to carry him to the point that will set showmen crazy to have him as
& freak.

Hon. James H. Budd, Governor, Sacramento.
Cal.â Dear Sir: Replying to your Inquiry of
even date I beg to state that no claim of the
State Printing Office for work or labor done or
supplies or materials furnished during the
forty-sixth fiscal year has been paid out of the
appropriation for the support of that office for
the forty-seventh fiscal year. This could not
be done under the law, as the appropriation
for the support of the State Prin tine Office for
the forty-seventh and forty-eighth fiscal years
is included in the general appropriation act of
1895 and cannot be expended for bills or
claims accruing in any other fiscal years. The
bills, which are sworn to by the Superintend
ent ot State Printing as being correct, must
show on their face the fiscal year in which the
indebtedness was incurred and I could not
legally draw my warrant against the appro
priation lor the forty-seventh fiscal year in
payment of an indebtedness created in tho
for ty-sixt^i fiscal year. Very respectfully.
E. P. Colgan, Controller.

BAKEESFIELD, Cal., March 15.âWil
liam Firebauph, a well â¢ known young
farmer of this county, and Miss Minnie
Hamilton of Keene met in town this
morning and were married in haste. The
ceremony was performed at a hotel by a
Justice. At the same hour Miss Rose
Winters and her mother, of Tejon Can
yon, arrived at another hotel. Shortly
afterward it leaked out that Miss Winters
bad been bidden by young firebaugh to
come and make ready for the marriage
altar.
Following close upon her arrival uews
of Firebaugh's marriage to Miss Hamil
ton reached Miss Winters' ears. Then
there was consternation in the Winters
family, accompanied by tears and words
of bitter reproacn. Finally it dawned
upon the Winters that Firebaugn's act
was a proof of a despicable nature, and
therefore Mhs Rose was fortunate in not
having married him.
It appears that Firebaugh has been car
rying on a courtship for some time with
both young ladies, and liad set the mar
riage day and hour with each at Monday,
March 15, at 10 A. M. Of course neither
knew of his relations with the other. Miss
Hamilton arrived first, and Firebaugh
acted upon the principle "tirst come first
served." The Winters brought wedding
gifts and refreshments for a banquet this
evening after the ceremony.
Soon after Firebaugh's marriage he dis
appeared, to the great astonishment of
his bride. He was seen late this after
noon riding roountninward. It is sup
posed that he left to avoid the wrath of
the Wmters. Both young ladies are wel
connected.
GOLD ON THE UVAS.

SAN JOSE, Cal., March 15.â A ledge of
gold ore has been struck on the ranch of
Captain J. C. Wendt on the Uva->, and a
force cf men is working night and day
running a tunnel in tue mountain to tap
the main lead. Specimens of sulphurets
were sent to the Nevada Metal Works of

WOODLAND, Cal., March 15.â Frank
and Edward Prather, who reside near
Knights Landing, have been arrested on a
charge of stealing about forty head of cat
tle from the Fair ranch. Some of the cat
tle were driven off on Monday night and
the rest the following night. B. G. Peart,
the manager of the Fair ranch, located the
stolen cattle on the Prather range, near

Constable Smith of Arbuckle arrested him
on Saturday. Frank, the other brother
implicated in the crime, lived with his
family near Knignts Landing and his ar
rest was made at a late hour last Satur

prisoner. He was handcuffed while lying
in bed and his weapons were placed out
of i;is reach. He had a pistoi lying on a
table neur his bed, another one was found
under bis pillow, and in the corner of the
room stood a Winchester rifle. The offi
cers believe Praiher would have shown
fight had he not been surprised. The
prisoner was brought to Woodland and is
now in tue County Jail.
The Prather boys have always borne a
bad reputation in this county. Ed Prather

very likely that the Santa Fe would pur
chase the road at foreclosure sale next

consolidation with the Atlantic and IV

be general manager of the entire division
from Albuquerque, N. Mex., to San Die jo,
known as the western div son of the Santa
Fe system. ' Both roads are now declared
to be in better shape than ever before.

MAYFIELD, Cal., March 15.â Vincent
Pellanda, one of the night watchmen of
the Stanford estate, attempted suicide yes
terday afternoon. About two months ago
his wife, a comely Spanish woman, left
him for another man. He has been brood
ing over his troubles ever since, and al
though living with his children, decided
to end all.
Pellanda shot himself through the
throat, the bullet ranging upward through
the ton ue and finally io lg:ug in the fore

his chances for recovery are slim. Pel
landa, who is still conscious, begged the
doctor to put him out of his misery. He
has many friends here and his hasty ac

CONDITION OF THE SMALLER
PUGILISTS.
While Conceding Weight Green Is in
Bitter Form Than Smithâ How
the Betting Goes.
I CARSON, Nev., March 15.â For the
.first time in its history Carson was to-day
given .an , opportunity to size up a crowd
of real prize-ring goers. True it is that
hundreds have dropped into town during
the past fortnight, but it was not until
to-day that the legitimate article, as it
â were, put in an appearance, and once
started the crowd came in such numbers
as were never before seen in this part 01
the country.
The early morning train, which usually
brings passengers from both East and
West, was not so plentifully loaded, and
for that reason the residents of Carson
began to think that Dan A. Stuart's great
carnival was not going to be such a stu
pendous affair after all. Bat Masteison,
the famous Southern sport, who is to take I
charge of the entire police arrangements
at the arena, was on this train, and so
was the noted "Parson" Davies of Chi
cago, who is to challenge the winner of
the big battle in behalf of Joe Choynski;
but even they did not set the enthusiasm
going. There was "nothing doing" of the
spectacular variety until this afternoon,
when Harry Corbett's big special train
arrived from San Francisco, and then the
town was practically turned upside down.
This train was over four hours late be
cause a string of freightcars had been de
railed at Towies on the California side
â¢ and blocked the way, but it carried a
good-natured crowd, comprising notables
of San Francisco representing every pro- j
fession and shade of society. Sailor Tom j
Sharkey probably got away with most; of j
*rid/.3ita*fTl&r 83-J admiration of the fast
crowd that had gathered at the depot to
welcome the train, t aDd the populace
trooped after him when he started uptown
as if he were the Prince of Wales. In
deed, it is doubtful, had the Prince
alighted from the same train, if the
mariner would not have had altogether
the best of it. Prize-fighters of reputation
rank above statesmen and all other kinds
â¢ of heroes here in Carson at present.
Doctor O'Donnell followed along in
Sharkey's wake, but as he bad never been
a candidate for Governor, Mayor, Coroner
or any other old thing in Nevada, he did
not get the reception that might have
been accorded him on the Potrero or in
Butchertown when at home. But the
doctor did not emit anything like a wail,
nor did he wring his bands, for he had
troubles of his own.
It appears that during the journey hither
, this eminent office-seeker took advantage
of an opportunity to escape from the hordes
of handshakers and settled himself down
in a soft buffet couch for a nap. While
thus peacefully engaged the hungry eye of
some nimble-fingered rogue alighted upon
that round and fat sparkler that has for a
decade illuminated the doctor's shirtf ront,
and connections were made instanter.
When the doctor awoke he attempted to
have the train sidetracked in order that
everybody on board mi^ht be searched,
and when this privilege was denied him
he threatened to make a sandlot speech.
â¢ Ordinarily such a dire threat would pro
" duce tears from a rock, but it did not have
the effect of bringing back the diamond.
No wonder, then, that the doctor pined
not for a brass band reception upon his
arrival in Carson. ;
There were others on that train. Wyatt
Earp, he of the gun and doubtful reputa
tion as a referee, tripped down the steps
and upon the depot platform jim as chip
per as if he expected to succeed George
. Biler in his task of deciding whether Cor
bett or Fitzsimmons is the champion of
the world. ;
â¢ 'â¢Only as a spectator, that's all," said
Wyatt, patronizingly, in response to a
newspaper man's inquiry as to the real
object of his visit. ''I want to see how
some of these other referees get along,"
he added with a wink. "I hope you re
porters will let me alone up here end not
roast me the way you did down in San
â¢ Francisco. You know we are up in bad
man's country now, so don't prod me too
much."; â¢
Wyatt accompanied this latter sally
â¢ with one of his quiet laugh?, and probably
meant the whole thing as a joke.
Ex-Supervisor Joe King of San: Fran
cisco was a member of the excursion party
and looked quite dignified - as he walked
up' Carson street in company. with Colonel
.Brady and the "banjo-eyed kid," Charley
Kins, Jim Corbett's brother-in-law; ; Eddie
Gooke, Jim's press agent, and Harry Cor
bett make up a little party of their own,
and the Olympic Club was represented by
Buch distinguished members as Jimmy
Coffroth and .Al Hampton, cyclist and
boxer respectively^ And there were many
others, all noted in various ways, but "too
numerous 'to mention." Special trains
will continue to roll in now until an hour
" before the big battle.
The greatest 'event of importance in
Carson to-day was the announcement
made by Dan Stuart late this afternoon
, that -his now world-famous fistic carnival
will see its beginning and conclusion all
in one dayâ the T 17th. This came as a
great ' surprise â : to both the press corre
spondents and the people of Carson, and
neither of v them like it altogether. The
scribes can discern ahead of them a day's
. work that will be f simply staggering and
something s that j will come ' near j choking
the telegraph office, despite the great
preparations made by the Western Union
Betting on the Fight in Harry Corbett's Poolroom, the Principal One in Carson.
jto handle over 1,000,000 words. The Car
j sonites see a short session and a conse
| quent early departure of the visitors, thus
depriving them of a grand opportunity to
reap a golden harvest. Bat it cannot be
helped now, and tbe only thing to do l?
to mate the best of abaM job. The original
programme was to have at least two days of
fighting and a continuation of the champ
ionsnip live-bird shoot until probably the
end of the week, and tbe shopmen, ,
restaurant helpers and hotel men eagerly
looked forward to the grand clean-up.
They will have to do some lively work
now to even half fulfill theirexpectations.
Dan Stuart had his reasons for making
this important change. He found out
that his chief support in the way of at
! tendance was to come from the Pacific
I Coast, with San Francisco as the center,
! and not from tne East as he had joyfuuy
anticipated.
The East has "fallen down" on the big
Texan shamefully. Trainload after train
load of sports were promised by New
YorK, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia,
i Cincinnati and other big cities, but uot
one of these promises was fulfilled. There
is not one big special en route to Carson
from the East, I am told;
Most of those who are journeying west
ward to see the big fight are taKing the
regular overland and will, therefore, drop
into town singly and unannounced.
AH this, of course, was a disappoint
ment to Stuart and something he had not
expected.
Now that the coast people are to form
the bulk of those who are to be at the
arena, Stuart has recognized their claims
regarding the programme. Most of them
want to start back for their respective
homes and places of business on the
evening of the 17th.
This being the case there would scarcely
be a corporal's guard at the ringside the
following day to witness tho so-called
small fights. Dan must make hay while
the sun shines if he wishes to come out
even on this mammoth venture, and he j
must cater to the masses while they are
in Carson. This is why he decided to
crowd his whole show into St. Patrick's
day.
The Corbett-Fitzsimmons battle will
take place first. The two big world's
championship aspirants were notified to
day that they will be required to be in
their respective dressing-rooms at the
arena at 10 o'clock Wednesday morning.
I am given to understand by Stuart
that the tight will begin no later than 11
o'clock, as at that hour the sun, if it is
shining, is in its most advantageous posi
tion for the taking of kinetoscope nega
tives. The management figures on this
contest being over by lunch time.
The arena will then be cleared, a two
hour intermission will be ordered, and
then the place will be reopened for the
scraps between "Mysterious" Biliy Smith
and George Green, Dal Hawkins and Mar
tin Flaherty. Spectators will be permit- j
ted to see both of these latter contests for j
one admission, and this will be just half
of what it will cost to see the heavy
weight battle.
Now, regarding these two "little" fights,
I will say that among the sports now
gatnered here a strong opinion prevails
that one or even both of them is quite
likely to eclipse "ihe fight of thecenlury,"
as it is called, so far as an out and out ex
hibition of fighting is concerned.
The excitement and discussion attend
ant upon the main event of the carnival
these side issues have been to a great de
gree forgotten; and it is not so surprising
when one stops to consider the magnitude
of the world's cbunipionship contest.
Nevertheless, these side affairs are going
to be well worth seaing, or I am a poor
judge of ring events.
T^ke the contest between Green and
Smith, for instance. Who does not know
what to expect when these dashing welter
weights get at each other? Both have
trained hard and faithfully. Both are
ambitious, and both are very close to the
championship rung of the ladder.
I sa<* both of these lads to-day, and it
was difficult to determine which was the
most confident and determined to win.
So far as condition goes I will venture to
say that Green has a little the best of the
situation.
He has suffered nothing by reason of
the change of climate, has entirely recov
ered from the cold he contracted Dy being
capsized In the Carson River, and his
sprained thumb is a* good as ever. He
weighs to-day just 146 pounds, and ex
pects to enter tbe ring a pound heavier.
Hilly Smith, while good enough to fight
a good, hard battle, shows some evidences
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
MR. CORBETT'S LETTER.
Carson, March 15, 1897.
Editor of the Soft Thing (in care of the Sheriff, Sacramento, Cal.):
Two days hence 1 swat Fitz.
I've had cards circulated around San Francisco informing the
public of my triumphal return. If it isn't a triumphal return it isn't
your fault. You've done all for me you could ; so much indeed I some
times fear you've overdone it. But that can't be the case. You're too
brainy for that.
If anything makes me tired more than another it's the preachers of
San Francisco. They don't tell the truth about us. Sunday one of
them said that we gave twenty-one columns to McKinley's inaugura
tion and three times as much to the fight. Maybe he didn't mean to
tell what wasn't true, but his arithmetic must be in need of a tonic.
I've kept count and I'll take my affidavit that we've run twenty times
as much about the fight as we ran about the inauguration. According
to my figures we've printed 390 columns about this great contest and
we ran only twenty columns about the inauguration.
If the preacher does not retract I'll have my opinion of him.
1 have learned one thing since I came to Nevada that will be of
service to me all my life. 1 have learned that it pays to keep in out
of the wet. This information is copyrighted.
lam delighted to see Senator Ingalls here as our commissioner. I
suppose if we'd called him correspondent he'd have been huffed and
would have refused our little bait. It isn't every paper that can get
an ex-Senator of the United States to report a prize-fight for it.
What a self-sacrificing man Mr. Ingalls must be !
I am told that you have in the window on Market street the gloves
that 1 am to wear in the fight. That's enterprise as is enterprise.
Now, I've a pair of suspenders that I broke the other day and a shoe
that is bursted. Couldn't you put them too in the window ?
Isn't the Monitor dreadful !
I think we missed a turn on this Sacramento business. We should
have pictured our men who went to jail as martyrs in the middle of a
big fire giving up their lives for their honor. It would have caught on.
Then we might have had meetings denouncing the Legislature for its
tyranny and passing resolutions praising our honesty and purity of
purpose. But perhaps it's as well we didn't. It's hard to make people
fancy our Andy fighting for his honor after that little affair with Frank
Moffitt and maybe the resolution dodge has been worked by us too
often.
How would it do to get Mr. Cleveland to report the fight for us ?
We might call him the Examiner's embassador to the fight at Carson.
I don't think it would make Mr. Ingalls jealous. I know that 1 and the
other writers here have not been jealous of him. I am suffering with
writers' cramps again and must close. Yours fraternally,
COMMISSIONER CORBETT.
of having trained too rapidly. Billy was
rather late in getting on the ground, and
when he arrived here was corpulent and
away out of condition generally.
With scarcely more than two weeks'
work at Genoa before him he had to go
about it in a lively manner and has prob
ably worked a little too hard. Smith
does not think, s n , though, and nobody
can convince him that he is not fit to fight
for his life.
But what Smith might fall short in as
regards condition he will offset by his
superior weight and size. He is larger
than Green in almost every detail, and
will probably outweigh him in the ring by
a good dozen pounds.
I doubt if Smith can ever right again as
a simon-pure welter-weight. He is sup
posed to be such in this coming fight, but
us the articles of agreement allowed the
men to come Jn at catch weiehts he will
not trouble himself to scale into the welter
class.
These lads are certain to put up a fast,
furious and stubborn fight â something of
the bulldog variety. Both are terrible
punishers ar.d are aggressive.
Smith's greatest fault is his proneness
to lose his head and fight foully. He has
lost many a battle by reason of this fail
ing. He i v not a scienced or finished
boxer, but a fighter purÂ«and simple.
In Green he wili find a pugilist who can
give him lessons so far as the science of
the game is concerned, but who, despite
his cleverness, does not rely upon it to
keep him always out of harm's way.
George likes heavy and damaging work,
and I have kr.own him to frequently ac
cept an invitation to mix ttiinga with an
opponent, whereas if he had used more
discretion and craft he could have won
with far more neatness and without sus
taining any injuries of consequence.
The fight between Hawkins and
Flaherty for the feather-weight champion
ship should furnish tbe spectators with a
splendid exhibition of quick and clever
boxing. Both are in superb shape, confi
dent and eager for tbe play.
They will be required to weigh in at 128
pounds. Flaherty is reckoned as one of
the cleverest little men in America, and if
i.c loses ;he Eastern contingent here will
drop wads o. f money.
He won his golden spurs when he de
feated Frank Erne, the only man who
ever got a decision from George Dixon,
the colored phenomenon of Boston. He
has fought and bested the best men of his
class in this country and teels quite cer
tain that Hawkfn3 will be a "mark" for
him.
Flaherty is a shorter lad than the San
Francisco boy, and inferior to him as re
gards reach, but he is chunky, as round
as a. barrel and as strong as a young lion.
He is said to be more shifty than
Hawkins. Dal will doubtless tase every
advantage of his superior reach, and will
essay to slaughter the Easterner at long
range. The Californians will play him
strong in the betting, because this is tbe
first time he ever fought a man who really
belongs in his class, and as he has invari
ably beaten men much bigger than him
self, they figure that he should defeat
Flaherty in a walk. I would not be sur
prised to see this fight last twenty-five or
thirty rounds.
Jim Corbett did his last work to-day,
and the punching-bag and boxing-gloves
have been relegated to the property
trunks. He will take a couple of walks
to-morrow, but exert himself in no other
way.
His windup this morning comprised
about an hour and a quarter of inside
work, with the usual routine ot bag
punching, handball, wrist-machine exer
cise and boxing. The latter was made
extremely light by order of Jim's trainers.
They consider that he has reached the
acme of physical perfection, and they will
not allow him to take tne slightest chance
of receiving a strain or a bruise, no matter
how trifling.
Fitzsimmons boxed wi:h his sparring
partners and played handball, too, during
the morning, and then went out for a spin
on bis bicycle. In the afternoon he and
Mrs. Fitzsimmons went out for a drive in
their phaeton.
There was rather a suspicious occur
rence on tbe road leading to Shaw's
Springs about 3 o'clock. Corbett had just
left his training quarters for a walk and |
was accompanied by several of his retinufc
of trainers, bis dogs and a number of
friends. He beaded toward Carson and
immediately an (exclusive) reporter or
two galloped off ahead of him on horse
back.
They took up a position at a fork in the
i road leading off to Sam Davis' ranch and
waited for something to happen. It came
near happening this time. Corbett jogged
along ami finally reached the fork, but in
stead of continuing on toward Carson he
turned off toward the Davis ranch.
Jim had not gone more than 200 yards
along this path when Bob Fitzsimmons
and his wife came along the main road in
their phaeton. Joe Corbett, who was out
on bis wheel, bad espied Fitzsiraraons and
pedaled along behiDd him to see what was
going to happen, and iv his wake came
Billy Brady and 'Kid" Eagan in a buggy.
All expected a sensational meeting.
1 drove along with the crowd too, but I
guess there were too many of us on the
road to favor another "exclusive" story,
for Fitzsimmons turned his horse around
after he reached the fork and drove back
to Carson.
Had he arrived out there a minute sooner
bo would have come face to face with the
Californian. I don't think there would
have been any exchange of discourtesies
though, even if they baa collided. The
presence of Mrs. Fitzsimmons would have
prevented such a thing. â¢
Corbett, always a gentleman, would
scarcely hava stooped to insult under
such circumstances.
Martin Julian, Fitzsimmons' manager,
came into town as usual ta-day and had a
new complaint to register at Dan Stuart's
headquarters.
Sibce ibe kick about Siler's rules was
abandoned by Martin his acquaintances
have been wondering what would be his
next objection. It developed to-day to be
an expression of dissatisfaction regarding
his and Fiszsimmons' share of the klnete
scope profits.
Stuart sold this concession for some
thing like $10,000 and promised to give
Corbett and Fitzsimmons 15 per cent each.
Julian now has it in his head that Fizsim
mon's share should be 331^ per cent and
Corbett's and Stuart's the same. He ac
cused Stuart of wanting too much.
The big Texan declined to listen to
the proposition at all. He says tbe failure
of the Eastern excursions will leave him
to do enough scratching in order to come
out even, much less dividing up more of
his prospective earnings with the fighters.
I referred at the beginning of this ar
ticle to tbe arrival of Sailor Tom Sharkey.
Well, the object of Tom's visit is to chal
lenge tbe winner of tbe championship
battle. Tom is also going to make his
debut as an exclusive newspaper corre
spondent.
The sailor says that if he can't beat
John L. Sullivan or Corbett and Fitzsim
mons in tbe art of dishing up signed state
ments, he will go back to sea. But Tom
wants to challenge the winner; tbe loser
he will not deign to recognize at all.
"If 1 can't get on a match with the
champion I'll challenge Peter Maher,"
said the brawny sailor.
"And tnat goes for our money, too,"
chimed in Danny Lynch, Sharkey's man
ager.
"I have a wad of money with me, and
will either put up a depositor the whole
side bet right now. We stand ready to
tight for anything from $2500 upâ the big
ger tbe bet tbe better we will like it.
"Tom wants to get at the winner of this
fight. He has beaten both of them and
wants to do it to tbe best of tbe two once
more, so as to be entitled to the champion
ship. We have our money here and we
mean bus-mess.
"I expect that either of them will craw
fisb. They have found Sharkey a tough
nut to crack. If we can't drive either of
these fellows into the ring we will go after
Peter Maher and will endeavor to have
the match come off in Carson."
Sharkey aud Lynch have gone out to
Empire and will stop with Hawkins and
Green during their stay in these parts.
Another special train arrived from San
Francisco late to-night, bringing about 200
more spectators for the fight. The Carson
commiitee on accommodation bandied
the crowd with dispatch.
An hour after the new-comers had
alighted from tbe train tbey had all been
provided with sleeping apartments, and
there is still plenty of room to spare.
Harry Corbett's poolroom opened the
betting on tbe big fight to-night, and
over $3000 was taken over the counter.
The prevailing odds were 10 to 6%, owing
to the scarcity of Fitzsimmons money.

CARSON, Nev., March 15.â A temper
ature of summer, coupled with a bright
sun and , a clear sky, greeted Corbett and
Fitzsimmons this morning when they
arose to prepare for the light finishing
touches which ' are to . cap - the climax of
their arduous labors like the varnish on
the furnished mahogany.
\ The weather had the effect ; of a dozen
tonics on \ Dan Stuart, and "delighted the

Corbett played . with his favorite wrist
machine for nearly twenty minutes. He
eazed lovingly at the old shaft .and told
the spectators how many years he had
worked up muscle with the apparatus. 1 :
: The driving power ; behind i the j blows
which laid out Sullivan and Mitchell was
all Generated with the weights and shafts
which shall pass into the hands of a San
Francisco journalist to-morrow. ? Jim lost
all of his sentimentality when he faced the
puncbir.g-bag, however, and he cuffed it
about as though he had no further use
for it.
Corbett tarried for another, twenty min
utes with the bag, and then announced
himself ready to ta*e Jim Nealon's scalp
at handball. Three red hot games were
played in less tnan an hour, and Nealon
did not figure in any of them to much ex
tent.-:. - -\ f â -:.-:_; .: -'-;.â  â '*:.â  ; :.;,;
Jim kept up a crossfire of sarcasm at

is down to 146 and looks all over a winner. ,
Haw Kins will not have a pound to spare
in order to get within the limit of 128, but
he appears to be in better shape than any
man in tqe bunch.
Smith is the moÂ»t unlikely lookinz
pugilist of the lot, but he claims that the
doctor will find no iiies on him and that
Green will have his birthmarks spoiled
before the fight is over.
Flaherty is down to 124 and his face i 3
as red as a New England lobster. He has
more coin behind him than have any of
the others and is not saying much about
what be will do with Hawkins.
The great championship battle will not
be a betting affair. In fact there is less
play on the heavyweight evoit than on
any of the other fights. Most of the com
binations beginning with Corbett and end
ing with Hawkins command a premium
of about 20 per cent over those ending
with Flaherty, and almost 40 per cent
over those beginning with Fitzsimmons.
Smith and Green are being played lightly
at about even money. Fitzsimmons'ad
herents want 10 to 6on their man. The
poolrooms are laying 10 to 7 and taking in
nothing on the Australian. Not a single
individual bet of any magnitude has been
reported in Carson.
The ring-posts and ropes arrived from
San Francisco to-day and will be set in
place to-morrow. The platform will be
floored with tongue- grooved white pine,
carefully planed and covered with resin.
The ring proper will be twenty-four feet
square within the ropes, and the platform
will project eighteen inches beyond the
posts.
Dan Stuart's office is being closely
guarded by a couple of Pinkertcn detec

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
TUESDAY MARCH 10, 1897
Read the President's message.
McKinley's style is short and meaty.
No one can complain that the Presi
dent's message is too long.
Now is the time for Californians to get
together and work together.
Congress should see to it that the session
like the message is short and strong.
The President's message contains only
about 1000 words. The new era is here.
Mr. McKinley said nothing about the
currency question. That is another story.
Tue Nevada mill will move lively while
it lasts, but. fortunately, it won't last
long.
Congress has started the legislative
machinery and before long the mi. Is will
be rnoviig.
We shall soon know what the new tariff
bill contains, and the chances are it will
contain all we wish.
It is now said that Lord Salisbury is
patting Greece on the back with one hand
while shaking the other fist in her face.
How is that for diplo ruacy ?
There is lots of new blood in the Senate
and lots of young blood in the Hour-e. We
may expect this Congress to show snap
and vigor from the word "go."
The way to promote prosperity in Cali
fornia is to break away from old fights
and get toeeUier for new wort. Congress
pets the example and the peopie should
follow it.
The scheme of the Czar to have .1 Rus
sian Prince appointed to rule Crete doesn't
promise much in the way of autonomy.
Where Russian Princes are in ofliee the
Czar governs.
The reports of big gold discoveries in
Oklahoma are not wholly unexpected.
The boomers most always have a boom of
some kind, and the divorce business has
recently had a collapse.
The only point in the policy of co
ercing Greece abunt which the powers can
asree is that it serves to distrac t atten
tion for a time Ironi the failure of their
attempt to coerce Turkey.
"In raising revenues," says Mr. McKin
ley, "duties should b* bo levied upon
foreign products as to preserve the home
market as laras possible to our producers."
That is the talk that means business.
The Spanish authorities in Cuba have
already shown that they understand the
meaning of the changed administration at
Washington and American citizens in the
island will get better treatment after tb.l3.
The delegates to th? convention of the
Railway Mail Service Benevolent Associa
tion will receive a cordial welcome in San
Francisco. National assemblies do us
proud and we are always glad to have
them.
While tie House of Representatives is
enacting the new 'ariff the Senate will
have a cnance to settle the aibitration
treaty, and thus business will move at
both ends of the Capitol and the affairs of
the country will soon bo straightened out.
"It is already eviden \ that, in the Depart
ment of Agriculture Secretary Wilson 13
the right man in the right place. The
policy which he outlined in an interview
with The Call shows that he intends to
advance our agricultural interests and
knows .':ow to do it.
In a recent address before the Academy
of Sciences at Brussels General Krialmont
estimated that at the existing rate of in
crease the population of the earth would
exceed the possibilities of food production
in 176 years. This, therefore, is the time
to begin to save wheat.
A New York clergyman in discussing
social discontents recently maintained
that there is more discontent among rich ,
peopie than among poor. Lavish extrav
agance, such as the Bradley Martin ball,
does not much disturb the ranks of pov
erty, he said, but it makes all the rich
folks who were not invited enviou*. jeal
ous and dissatisfied with themselves and
everybody else.
The proposed gift of a park to Berkeley,
â¢by Captain R. P. Thomas, is another evi
dence of the generous public spirit which
actuates so many of the older residents of
the State, and which will doubtless have
its influence in molding the civic pa
triotism of younger men. The park will
be a most notable addition to the attrac
tions of the university city, and it is to be
hoped there will be no difficulty in the
way of carrying out the intentions of the
donor in the near future.
Governor Hastings of Pennsylvania has
vetoed a resolution requiring that all
architects, contractors and laborers to be
employed on the proposed new Capitol
shall be Pennsylvanians und that all ma
terials used shall be of Pennsylvania pro
duction. The Governor is undoubtedly
right in holding that one State should Dot
seek to exclude citizens of others from
sharing in her markets and her work, and
yet it would seem that a Legislature might
justly give preference to the workers of
its own State in an undertaking which
is Co be paid for by the taxpayers of that
S.ate only.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's message is short, terse and vigorous. There is not one unneces
sary word in it. Every sentence terds to the direct object of setting before Congress
the conditions of the country, the evils which affect our industries and the proper
remedy lor them. The whole document does not contain above a thousand words and
yet it covers fully the issue to meet which Congress has been called in extra session.
The President points out that under the Republican tariff revenues for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1892, were sufficient to defray all expenditures and Jeave a sur
plus of $9,014,453. During that year $40,570,467 was paid on the public debt and the
annual interest charge decreased by $11,684,576.
Under the present tariff, with but few exceptions, no month of any fiscal year has
shown a revenue equal to the expenditure. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896,
there was an excess of expenditures ov*>r receipts of $25,203,245 70. The total receipts
of the three fiscal years ending June 30, 1896. were, insuflicient by $137,811,7-9 46 to
meet the total expenditures.
Not only are we without the necessary revenues for the treasury, but with the in
crease in the public debt there has been a corresponding increase in the annual inter
est charge amounting to $11,493,414. These facts, as the President declares, abun
dantly justify the calling of an extra session of Congress to provide a new revenue law
for the Government.
The President does not faii to inform Congress that in providing the new tariff
cure must be taken to provide for American industry as well as for the needs of the
Government. He says:
In raising revenues duties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the'
home market as far as possible to our producers, revive and increase manufactories; to re
lieve uud encourage agriculture ; to increase our domestic and foreign commerce; to aid and
develop mining and building, and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation liberal
wages and those adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justly entitled.
No other subject is treated in the message. All other issues are left to be dealt
with after the important work of providing a revenue for the Government and protec
tion to industry has been performed. No message could be more businesslike than
this. It goes directly to the point, and having made plain the reasons for calling the
extra session, adds not one unnecessary word. We have at last a President who is
something more than a wordmonger, and the message will be read with satisfaction
throughout the country.
WELCOME GUESTS.
The delegates of the Railway Mail Ser
vice Benevolent Association, who will
meet in San Francisco this week, will be
welcome guests in every sense of the word.
The hospitality of the people of San Fran
cisco will give them the freedom of the
City in all that the term implies. They
are good men engaged in good work, and
our people will be more than pleased to
extend to them every courtesy and every
help possible.
It is always gratifying to have a Na
tional assembly of any kind in San Fran
cisco. We are so remote from the center
of population that wben any body of men
representing all sections of the Union
select this City as a place of meeting it is
evident, that they regard California and
San Francisco with reelings of more than
ordinary friendliness. Men do nor come
all the way across the continent for noth
ing. All questions of convenience, cheap
ness of transportation and of time required
for worlc are in favor of Eastern cities for
National assemblies. Wnen such assem
blies meet in San Francisco it is therefore
an evidence that they are willing to forego
all those advantaees for the sake of seeing
this portion of the Union and cultivating
friendly relations with its people.
The work of the convention will be of
interest to all who note with gratification
the growing development of iraternal as
sociations among our people, and tne
steady increase of the practice of mutual
aid and co-operation. W hile the proceed
ings will directly cincern only the mem
bers of tne railway mail service the action
taken will be indirectly henelicicl to the
whole mass of people, inasmuch as it will
bo another evidence of what can be ac
complished by any sociisty, community or
industry whose members work together
with a common object and for the general
benefit.
In the double capacity, therefore, of
friendly visitors and of representatives of
th? ereat principle of co-operation the
delegates to the convention will be wel- j
come in this City. They will be every
where regarded as entitled to the beet that
San Francisco can give. It is gratifying |
to be able to announce that the arrange- j
ments made for the reception of the dele
gates give assurance that they will be re- ]
ceived, welcomed and entertained in true
Californian style. This is as it should be.
California is gratified by the assembling
of the convention in us metropolis and
will show that gratification by a thousand
kindly courtesies to every visitor so long
as be remains within the borders of the
State.
COBDEN AND LIST.
The secretary of the National Associa- |
tion of Wool Manufacturers, in the March
number of the Forum, has a clever paper
comparing the tariff policies of the Cob
dm school in England and that of List in
Germany. Fifty years ago Cobden was !
the leader in establishing free trade in |
Great Britain, and at about the same time
L : st inaugurated the opposite system of
high protection in Germany. Stranga to
say, the writer asserts that both of these
statesmen were correct.
The explanation of this paradox is that,
in the secretary's opinion, "the fiscal
policy which is one nation's meat may be
another nation's poison." Ha does not
believe there is any fixed economical law
which predetermines what policy is best
for every nation, and claims that the his
tory of the world's industrial development
shows that very widely differing tariff
policies may be suitable to the same na
l tion's prosperity at different times. He
even docs not think it improbable that
within the next hfty years we may see
Germany changing to free trade and Eng
land going back 10 protection.
In the iast twenty years England's
manufactured exports hava decreased 22
per cent, and her manufactured imports
increased 47 per cent. In forty years
German}', under her protective policy, in
creased her commerce 350 per cent, a3
compared with England's 150 percent, and
now, though Germany started far behind
the mistress of the seas, she has attained
to an equality of industri al development
with her great neighbor and rival, and
promises to speedily outstrip her in the
race for supremacy.
The distinctive feature of List's eco
nomic teaching was that he enunciated
the principle of nationalism as opposed to
the theories of free trade, by which he
meant that the main purpose of a great
national lucal policy was not merely to
gain material by exchanging goods for
goods, but rather "to gain in political and
productive power."
The conclusion of the whole matter, ac
cording to this reasoner, is that there is no
casNiron rule as to the comparative bene
fits of protected .industries or unirain
meled trade, but it is a question to be de
termined by each nation for itself, accord
ing to the exigencies of that nation at a
given period. List's opinions were chiefly
derived from a study of the rapidity with
which protection gave the United States
industrial independence, and the result
shows bow wise he was in following our
lead.
The women of Chicago have consented
to remove their hats in theaters, but still
the men are not satisfied. It is now com
plained that the girls are too tall for men
to see over their beads. This, however,
may oe only a trick of the Chicago fellows
to make the world believe their girls can't
be overlooked. J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
SEORETAEY WILSON.
The policy which the new Secretary of
Agriculture, Mr. Wilson, outlined in an
interview with our Washington cor
respondent is one which promises to be of
great benefit to the people. The mere
statement of it shows that the Depart
ment of Agriculture i>( now preside! over
by a man widely different from the un
popular Secretary Morton and in that fact
alone there is good reason for public satis
faction.
The new Secretary began his statement
to our correspondent by sayine that in
general terms his ambition will be first
to encourage the raising of the most
remunerative farm prodncts in this
country and second to find foreign mar
kets for them. He will strive to remove
all restrictions now placed upon the cx
i port of our agricultural products to
foreign countries and moreover wilt pro
mote the growth in this country of such
article* of farm produce as are most in
demand in the world's markets.
Coming down to matters of detail the
Secretary pointed out that there was
a chance to largely increase the mar
ket for American bntter. Europe, as
he says, does not and cannot pro
duce sufficient dairy produce to sup
ply the needs of its people and in this
industry there is a good chance for greater
development in America. In addition to
dairy products he hoped to .develop also
a larger production of nitrogenous foods.
These, as he says, are now m great de
mand in European countries ana can be
produced in America in much larger
quantities than at present.
A particular emphasis rots laid by the
new Secretary on the importance of de
veloping the sugar-beet industry. That
subject he elaborated in the interview to
a considerable length. To use his own
striking simile; "We are now Importing
millions of dollar-' worth of sunshine
from Germany every year." Sunshine, as
the Secretary says, makes sugar, and
when we import suear we are really leav
ing our own sunshine unused and import
ing it from tho cloudy skies and gloomy
climate of Germany.
In order to promote the cultivation of
nitrogenous foods and the development
of the beet-sugar industry, the Secretary
will introduce r new system of distribut
ing seeds. He will not send out seeds i
purchased indiscriminately, but will dis
tribute among the farmers such seeds as
are needed to produce the crops for which
there is the best market in Europe. Par
ticular attention will be given to the dis
tribution of sugar-beet seeds, and although
the Secretary has been in office but a few
days, contracts have already been made
for large quantities of beet seeds of the
best varieties, and the work of distribut
ing them will soon begin.
From the policy thus outlined it will be
seen that the change from Secretary Mor
ton to Secretary Wilson in tna Depart
ment of Agriculture will be of great ben
efit to the farmers. We now have in that
important position a man who will seek
to advance agricultural interests, and who
has evidently the required knowledge and
energy as well as the intention to do so.
Secretary Wilson is evidently the right
man in the right place, and President Mc-

WORKING TOGETHER.
All reports from "Washington show that
the Republican lenders of the Cabinet, of
the Senate and of the House of Repre
sentatives are working together cordially
and in perfect harmony. There is not the
slightest sign of division or dissension in
the party ranks. We are to have an
administration a? different as possible
from that of G rover Cleveland. Congress
instead of setting an example of discord
and stiife will show the country what can
be done by unity and co-operation.
This phase of the situation at Washing
ton will have its pfft-ct upon the country.
When the people see the earnestness with
whicli those who represent them iv the
National Government are laying aside
minor disagreements in order to act har
moniously together on those greater issues
which tend to tue general welfare they will
be prompted to act in a similar spirit.
Instead of having an era of disturbance,
agitation and annoyance we are to have
an era of rest, business and the peaceful
development of all forms of enterprise
from the construction of new railroads to
the cultivation of new farms and orchards.
To the people of California the example
set by the Republican leaders at Washing
ton is of particular importance. Our
people, by reason of causes which it is not
worth while at this time to review, have
been more divided than the people of auy
other State in the Union. For a long
time the dissensions among us were so
great that California could hardly achieve
anything either by co-operation among
her own people or from the National
Government.
That time now seems to be happily
passed. At present in the press of the
State there^is but one discordant, wrang
ling and slanderous voice. In every
other instance the press represents the
popular desire to establish harmony and
build up in the State that understanding
of the mutual relations of its people with
one another which is necessary to the
best results. This understanding we
trust will soon pervade every class of our
people. Congress and the administration
are working together. The era of good
reeling is beeun. Let us also work to
gether and our prosperity is assured.

A Garden Brigade*
Editor San Francisco Call: Why doesn't some one organize a garden brigade for the unem
ployed this beautiful sunny weather?
This has been done in a great many Eastern cities by utilizing the vacant lots. The poor
unemployed people of the City could in a few months provide themselves with vegetables to a
great extent. It is wonderful what a small piece of land will produce. Tne ground across the
bay is very fertile, I know, because I have tried it.
There are a great many people who would gladly allow their vacant lots to be worked. A
very few dollars would buy sufficient seed. Things that are substantial and yield well shou.d
be planted, such as potatoes, beans, peas, turnips and cabbage.
This movement needs to be organized. The poor should be helped to help themselves.
Tools might be rented, or hoes, spades, plows, etc., might be loaned by people who have them.
Last year I raised on a very small pit-ce of ground, 25x75 feet, more green peas, string beans,
onions, radishes and lettuce than my husband and I dould use, besides somo sweet corn, pota
toes and summer squashes, all without water.
I know a man who has plowed up, and spaded what he could not plow, five acres of the
steepest part of the Berkeler hills, and now has a promising looking crop of oats. He hai a
few cows and makes a good living for his wife and five children.
Don't all stay in ihe city. Try the countryâ the hills if you can't get the plains. Very re
spectfully, Mks. K. O.
THE APPROACHING OLIGARCHY.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sin: We are making rapid progress toward a new form of govern
ment. We are quietly passing under the control of a judicial oligarchy, the worst form of gov
ernmentâin which the supreme power is placed iv the hand* of a few personsâ which has yet
cursed the world, because in our case the Judges, as we all know, are appointed and controlled
by the trusts, combines and corporations, 'We aro going out of politics, and our reliance
hereafter will be upon the judicial arm of the Government" is the historical declaration of
Mr. Huntington. Government by injunction is already familiar to the public. Annulling
laws made by Congress and State Legislatures will probably be the more common procedure ot
the courts in the near future for governing the country.
A few days since, February 22, the Standard Oil Company set aside the law, a most just
anti-trust law, in Texas through a decision of the Federal Court rendered by Judge Swayne,
prononcing the low null and void. Attentive readers will rememoer that after a great strug
gle the Texas Legislature passed an anti- trust law early in 1895. considered the most compre
hensive, exhaustive and complete anti-trust law ever placed o-i a statute book in this country.
In due time an agent of the Standard Oil Company, our greatest and best organized trust
monopoly in the country, was indicted by the Grand Jury, and after a remarkable trial, was
convicted. He appealed to the Federal District Court, which has just released him and pro
nounced the law null and void.
It will be remembered that the interstate commerce law was enacted for the restraint and
government of railroad corporations, but was never enforced until its provisions were con.
strued by the courts so as to imprison Debs and bis fellow-officers of a labor organization. The
Texas law guarded against such aaangerous misuseoJ the law by this explicit provision: "This
act shall not be held to apply to livestock and agricultural products in the hands of the raiser,"
and to protect labor organizations added, "Nor shall it be understood or construed to prevent
the organization of laborers for the purpose of maintaining any standard of wages."
A bad law this for trusts and corporations, which affirmatively in express terms protected
labor organizations from assaults of any kind and lorbid the traffic of trusts and combines
within the limits of the great Sate of Texas. No such law must be allowed to stand in Texas,
for it destroyed trust rule in that State and was a menace to trusts in all other States, since the
Texans were determined to enforce the law. Accordingly "tho judicial arm" laid it low by one
foul blow.
Here is what the Judge had to say in support of his decision: "This law exempts four
fifths of the people from the operations of the act," the four-fifths engaged in agriculture and
labor, not interested in or connected with a trust or combine, which is always formed to fix
prices and control trade in order to tax the helpless four-fifths ol the population. But this
trust-appointed Judge continued: "Penalties nre visited upon the remaining flfth, in the face
of the constitutional guarantee of perfect equality before the law." His statement is un
qualifiedly false, for it applies to all citizens, if all citizens engage in the formation and
operation of trusts, just as the law forbidding theft or murder applies to all citizens without
discrimination.
But Judge Swayne ventures much farther. He goes so far as to write these words: "F-ven
in the matter of labor, the iniquitous character of the enactment under discussion was appar
eut, for under its terms and provisions the laborer was subject to punishment for doing the
very act the land-owner or farmer was authorized to do." The cooi aflroutery of this state
ment strikes one with amazement. In absolute terms, as we have seen, the law says: "Nor
shall it (trhe law) be understood or construed to prevent the organization of laborers for the
purpose of maintaining any standard of wages."
American respect for courts will become contempt for courts with Swaynes for Judges. And
the public misfortune is tnat there are others, not excepting Sbiras, and including those who
make laws by injunction. Respect lor courts is a dangerous sentiment when their decisions
insidiously subvert the foundations of the Government. To consent in silence to the usurpa.
tions of our corporation-ruled courts is tamely to submit to the stealthy establishment of a
judicial oligarchy. This I regard as a present impending peril. This peril is all the more
menacing that so lew seem to apprehend it. A solitary warning here and there is but a lone
cry in a great wilderness. JOSEPH ASBURY JOHNSON.

THE LIFE OF THE SEA.
Instructive Lecture by Professor Hitter
Before the Academy of
Sciences.
Professor \\ r . E. Ritter, assistant pro
fessor of biology at the University of Cali
fornia, delivered a lecture lust evening be
ford the Academy of Sciences on "The
Life of the Sea."
â¢ His discourse was directed toward show
*ns the significance of marine zoology in
th*e study of biological science. Its ctiief
importance, he held, lay in the great an
tiquity of marine life. All life had its
origin' in the sea, and in consequence of
the peculiar conditions of lile in that
element, the evenness of lemperature and
other conditions maintaining, a more
'teneral level of life and many more
Ancient forms are to be lound there than
tioon the land.
This, he said, enables the biolopist to
figure out the evolutionary history of ani
mals more successfully by their study
than the children of the land afford.

"Gismonda" Startles Bald
win Habitues With Its
Gorgeousness.
"Cissy" at the Columbia Theater
Fails to Draw the
"Chappies."
A Gooi House Greets the Second Week
of "Jim the Penman" at
the Alcaz .r.
Fanny Davenport's gorgeous produc
tion of "Gismonda" at the Baldwin Thea
ater last night was all the advance no
tices have painted it to be. Each scene
was a more magnificent piece of staging
than the one preceding it. and the be
jeweled dresses worn by the star were be
wilderingly ricb. and costly.
Lke so many of Sarduu's plays "Gis
monda" is a series of tableaux, linked
together by a story of love, hatred and
revenge. An especial element of pic
turesauenes? is introduced into this new
play by the scene being laid in Athens
during the Florentine dominion, thus
giving scope for the display of classic
ruins, as well as of Byzantirie and Floren
tine architecture, tapestries and paintings.
Iv the first tableau Gismonda, the wid
owed Duchess of Athens, vows to marry
the man who will rescue her infant son
from the tiger pit, into which he is sup
posed to have fallen accidentally. A fal
coner performs the feat, end tne Due ess
is so shocked at the thought of such a
plebeian alliance that she appeals to the
Pope for absolution from her vow.
The second act shows the cloisters of a
convent, where the Duchess has taken
refuge pending the Papal decision. The
scene is especially gorgeous in color, and
reminds one of a Florentine picture with
its airy colonnades burrounding a court
yard tilled with flowers.
An added picturesqueness is given by
the main body of the convent silhouette
in the background against a saffron and
crimson colored sunset. The scene in
Gismonda's palace is another triumph of
staging. Here the effect is more that of
Byzantium; the gorgeous tapestries bear
paintings of knights and saints, and
through the wide window the Gulf of
Athens fi.tshss the purple blue of the
Mediterranean.
The nymphs' hill by moonlight, with
its crumbling marble columns entwined
with ivy, is another beautiful stage pic
ture; and the last scene of all, the Church j
of Santa Maria, is almost sensational in
its realism. The devout may experience j
a momentary feeling that it is sacrilegious
to bee the priest at the high altar, the I
incense ascending and to hear the orsan j
peal forth, just as if it were a church and
not a theater at all. but there is no doubt
about the gorgeousness and realism of the
stage picture.
The story built round these tableaux is ;
of the usual Sardou type, ha which love >
triumphs over hate and disdain. Almerio, |
the falconer, refuses to release Gismonda,
and the Pope decides against her. The
haughty Duchess imprison? the man she
bas been ordered to wed, ana, moved by
caprice, orders hsr prisoner before her and
offers him her waiting-maid, Cypriella,
for a wife. Alnierio's protestations of
love move Gismonda to believe in his sin
cerity and to love him in return.
In this scene both Fanny Davenport
and Melbourne MacDowell, who plays j
Alraerio, do some excellent acting. Dav
enport's transitions from gayeiy to wrath
and from wrath to love are vervtfleverly
portrayed, and Melbourne McDowell's in
tense earnestness is very dramatic and
convincing.
In the scene on Nymphs' HillGismonda
learns that Zaccarie, the chief of her bar
ons, had planned to murder her little son
and is about to assassinate Almerio. She
strikes him down with his cwn ax,
and to save her from disgrace Almerio
takes the blame of his murder.
In the final s-cene ti.e Duches3 throws
pride to the winds and marries the humble
but faitnful f ilccner.
The heroic role of Gismonda suits Miss
Davenport well. She received a liberal
amount of applause. Melbourne Mac-
Dowell fuliy shared honors with her, if he
did not almost eclipse her in some of the
scenes by the manly straightforwardness
of hia acting. W. H. Elwood was elective
as the villain, Zaccarie. Tberese Miliord
was graceful and pleasing as Cypriella.
Norman D. Conniers was rather a stagy
bishop. The long cast of minor charac
ters was very efficiently filled.
At the Columbia.
San Francisco will certainly earn for Itself
the credit of nurturing none but good young
men. Cissy Fiizgerald opened at the Columbia
last evening, and there was not one chappie
present to give her a hand, not one baldhead
in the front row to take unio himself her elo
quent, much-advertised wink. Cissy came over
from Lnnnon Town with that aggregation of
blonde beauties that sang nnd danced, and
carried away the big American dollars, on the
pretext of presenting a farce-comedy called
â¢â¢The Gaiety Girl."
Cissy's role was a prominent winking part,
with a high kicuing accompaniment. And she
winked. Winked with one eye â the left eye â
and in sveh a manner that every chappie in
the house felt that that wink was directed to
him â and tv.ery baldhead was covered, not
with beads, but regular buttons of perspira
tion.
Then Bhe was no longer called Fitzgerald,
but just Cissy. Cissy, short and snappy as her
wink, sharp as tbe click of her pparly teeth,
ere lier I:p> parted in her all enveloping smilu
and twinkling as her black satin shod, ling and
slender foot, as it coquetted with the chande
lier.
Then la Cissy opened her big blue eye, ran
her slender ringers through her fluffy blonde
hÂ«lr, ruffled that complacent milk-white brow
of hers and decided she must be a s;ar. Like
one of those happy coincidences that bring a
tmigled comedy to a happy, all-satisfying con
clusion, the same thought flashed at tne very
same moment through the tiiinking-capot the
Napoleon of managers, Charles Frohman. He
at once closed with the b'.onde dancer, secured !
a play mat would fit nicely round her twin
kling tors and starred her for 200 nights at
lloyte's Theater in Lestoti] & Kobson's three
act'farce, ''ihe Foundling." '
It was in tins saino tremendous New York
success that la Ci.ssy opened at the Columbia
last evening. A packed house, staid ana
sedate in character, sat through the rather
dreary lever de rideau "Chums" and waited
patiently through an act and a ball of the
farce for the star to materialize.
Cissy came, swlit and s-ure as an arrow,
came, saw and winked, winked her advertised
wink with her adver.ised ie:t eye. raised her
twinkling toes and diseiosi-d billow upon bil
low of lace and frills and rosettes of pink baby
ribbon. There is no gainsaying the factâ
Cissy's lingerie, and she leaves nothing to tne
imagination, is "smashing."
Arm she can dance. She sways her long sup
ple body with a sinuocs Â«ure, manages grace
fully her yard upon yard of heavily flounced
skirts ana comes up culm, Â«miliug and se
rene, without one little blonde riuglet mussed
or out of place and her lmpo-sibie feather
decked hat secure nnd set at the proper angle.
"The Foundling" belongs to that large fam
ily of French Jar6es in which the seemingly
simplest misunderstanding leads to innumer
able and far-reaching en .anglemi-nts. The rim
two acts are spent In weaving tne knotty web,
and the last in explaining to those on the
stage wnat all along has teen so obvious to
those In the audience. There is the tyrannical
wife, the henoecked husband with his pen
cham for actresses, the lovers parted by a
senseless entanglement, the auftere maiden
and the low comedian, with loud clothes and
a cockney accent.
The people who labor with the intricacies of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
"The Foundling" are more than equal to the
requirements of their parts. Thomas Burns is
an unctuous Major Cotton, Miss Me ta Msynard
a fashionable and confiding ingenue, Ella
Craven a fetching Miss Usher and Adolph
Jackson a wanly Hetiry Miller, patent-leather
hair sort of a lover. Jacques Martin, Frank
Batton, E. Soldene Powell, Welter Smith,
Fanny Steven* aDd Clara Baker Rust all con
tribute to the general excellence of the cast.
By this evening, when the young men of this
virtuous City realize what they have missed,
It is safe to predict that tne front-row seats of
the Columbia Theater are going to be sold at a
premium.
The Grand Opera-House.
"The Eagle's Nest," a sensational comedy
drama, was presented to the patrons of the
Grand last night. To judge bj the liberal ap
plause it received it was a thorough success.
Miss Atwood was absent from the cast
owing to a severe sprain her ankle re
ceived when ju nping from the miil
window in "The Black Directive," and Miss
Anna Daly, a clever local girl of considerable
talent, gave a strong perfomance as "Ro-iie
Milford, a ray of sunshine behind a cloud."
Miss Julia Bianc plays the part of a rough
mountain woman with her usual amount of
vim. Â«he also assists Sen Willis in his well
known tramp specialty.
Mortimer Snow assumes the usual disguise
familiar to the ever persecuted but ever heroic
hero. John J. Pierson and Landers Stevens
iairly revel in villainy during the play, but
arc finally suppressed â in the last act, of
course. Fred Butler, who has lately devel
oped a talent lor clever "make-ups," plays
Geoffry Milford, a rather good old man, in a
very abte manner, but however good he may
bo in such parts the gallery gods will have
none of him.
They expect to find him a villain, and un
less he lives up to iheir expectations no ap
plause will ho receive. Leslie Morosco and
Julia Blanc form the comedy of the play.
Bert Monison does a very good dX of char
acter work in the iourth act. The scenic
effects are particularly good, and there is no
reason why 'Tne Eagle's Nesl" should not
enjoy a prosperous run.
At the Alcazar.
The opening night of the second week of
"Jim the Penman" drew a crowded house at
the Acazar. The piece Is a familiar one. well
produced and well played. There has been a
slight change in the cast, Miss Juliet Crosby
taking Mrs. Belmotir's place as Mrs. Chap
stone, and piaying it well.
Miss Buckley and Mr. Clayton work very

At the Oberon.
The Oberon Concert Hall on O'Farrell street,
near Stocston, is one of the finest family re-
I sorts on the Pacific Coast. The music ren
| dered there by Mr. Stark is something grand.

i Saturday and Sunday not a single seat was to
be found in the house. A fine class of peuple
patronize the place. Lawyers, bankers,
1 brokers, mechanics and laboring men sit to

witn the music. Special Police Officers Smith
and Newman, well known to ttie San Francisco
public, are tbe preserveis of the peace. Every

IN HONOR OF THE CHIEF

At the B'nai B'rith Hall last night Unity
Lodge No. 273, I. 0 B. 13., tendered a re
ception and banquet to Martin P. Stein,
grand president of the order, on the occa
sion of his first official visit to the lodges
of this district. The nineteenth anniver
sary of Unity Lodge was celebrated simul
taneously. .
Prior to the banquet the lodge held a
special session for the transaction of im
portant business, which included the in
itiation of two new members. The lodge
room itself wan most tastefully decorated
and the attendance of members excep
tionally large.
The guests, to the number of 200, after
ward adjourned to the banqueting hall,
where for upward of two hours they dis
[ cussed an elaborate menu with appetite
at least, and possibly digestion. But the
I menu speaks for itself: '
Oysters. Sauterne. Consomme ala Royal.
RELISHES.
Olives. Gurkcn.
Shrimp Salad Mayonnaise.
ENTREES.
Burgundy. Chicken Saute.
Champignons. Petit Pols.
ROASTS.
Duck and Turkey. Cranberry Sauce.
DESSERT.
Champagne. Icecream.
Assorted Cakes. Charlotte Russe Tourten.
Tourte a la Duchesse.
Rochefort. Fruits and Coffee. .
The society's sweetest songsters also
helped to increase the universal beatitude
with solos of a popular character.
Full justice having been done to the
menu, the ground was cleared for the
toastinaster, 'Maurice L. Asher, who Is
also president of Unity Lodge, to deliver a
brief address; which was eloquently ac
knowledged by Grand President Stein in
his reply to the coast of the District Grand
Ledge No. 4. The other toasts and speeches
of the evening were as follows: "./ â¢

THE AMARAPOORA
IN TROUBLE AGAIN
Had a Series of Vicissi
tudes in Central
America.
Her Crew Deserted and the Cap
tain Had to Fill Up With
Beachcombers.
There Were Several Fights During
the Voyage and the Cat Com
mitted Suicide.
The tramp steamer Amarapoora arrived
from Central American ports early yes
terday morning after an eventful trip.
After leaving the dock here she had a list
to starboard, and the surveyors refused to
pass her until a thorough examination
had been made. The vessel was finally
straightened up and allowed to go to
sea.
There were lively times on the way
down the coast, and at San Jose de Guate
mala nearly all the crew deserted. It was
The Brit'sh Tramp Steamer Amarapoora Arriving From Central
America. The Pilot Is Aboard, the Pilot's Flag Is Being

During the Voyage.
almost impossible to get men, and Cap
tain Cameron had to take beachcombers,
greasers, negroes and, in fact, anybody
mat would accept a passage for their ser
vices. They are a most motley set, and
as half of them have not a cent the Com
missioner of Immigration should see to it.
that they are not aliowed to land in this
country. On the way back to San Fran
cisco there was many a knockout dlow
given by a belaying-pin because the men
would persist in going aft when they were
sent forward and vice versa. Third Mate
Chermside and one of the firemen na<l-a
hot and heavy battle, but the fireman was
beaten and driven back into the stokehole
much the worse for wear.
At Champerico thero was more trouble.
The raw crew did not know how to handle
the ship and in consequence about $250
worth of coffee was dropped into the
ocean. Finally the ship's cat came to the
conclusion that there was a hoodoo on the
vessel and committed suicide when a day's
sail from this port. Tom was the pet of
Chief Officer Rouse and was in splendid I
health during the entire voyage. Early 1
Sunday morning while his master was
below the cat paid a visit to every one of j
the officers' rooms and then eoinp on deck j
made one bound overboard and was gone. [
That is the story told by the watch on
decs, but there are some who think the
poor brute was thrown overboard out of
revenge.
On Friday, the sth inst., Captain Came
ron reports that a turning mountain was
sighted in a line with Cape Corrientes.
It was not a very hiph mountain, but had
a large cone, and the flame* that it belched
forth lit up all the surrounding country.
The Amarapoora will discharge at sec
tion 2 of the seawall, after which the
chances are she will be laid up.
The wa:ers of Central America have not
agreed with her, and in consequence she
is anything but clean and her bottom is
covered with barnacles. Even If she does
go into commission again she will have to
go on the drydock before another trip can
be made. It is said that the men who
worked iheir way up are going to demand
pay, and yesterday said they would not
leave the steamer until they cot it. In
that event there will be some more trouble
aboard. â¢
TALKS OF PREACHERS.
Dr. Hempliill 'A' el Is His Jmpresaions of
Europeâ Bishop Clinton Makes an
Address to l'astors.
Rev. Dr. Hemphill gave the members of
tba Presbyterian Ministerial Association
bis impressions of celebrated preachers
gathered during a recent visit to tbe East
and to Europe. After dwelling at length
on the theme that preaching Christianity
means exhortation and edncation, the
doctor was asked to give details about
celebrated churches. He responded by
saying that he had found no spiritual
food at the Madeleine in Fario, and that
at the Victoria Church the genuflexions
of the clergyman and his assistants had
pained and shocked him.
"I could only think of a lot of trained
dogs and trained monkeys. Tbe average
Englishman stands up before his audience
and talka like a clown, and the clergyman ,
at the Victoria Church acted as if he had
been brought up in a barrel and fed at the
bungliole." Joseph Parker of the City
Temple was spoken of as grand and up
lifting. Dr. Heniphill also alluded ad
miringly to Canon Liddon.
An open letter to Rev. J. M. Alexander
from Mine. Marie Marshall was read. It
bad reference to some remarks made last
week by Mr. Alexander with regard to
the French occupation of the Marquesas
Islands. Mme. M:ir.-hall stated that the
evil was not with the French, but with
the rum-seliers of other nations. Sue said
the French Missionary Society had done
good work, and added that it was easy to
criticize with folded hands and leave the
work alone, "as your denomination leaves
the French Presbyterians of California."
It was unanimously voted to transmit the
letter to Mr. Alexander.
The Methodist preachers' meeting was
addressed by Bishop Clinton, who is con
ducting the colored conference at Zion
M. E. Church. He spoke especially in re
gard to his work in the South and the
East and gave an encouraging account of
the educational work being accomplished
by Bordon T. Washington in Georgia. S.
H. Hadiey, superintendent of the Jerry
McCauley mission, N. V., also gave Â«n
account of his work.
At the suggestion of the Baptist Preach
ers' Conference it was resolved to hold a
union mooting on April 19, at which the
speaker will be* Rev. J. Chynowith, presi
dent of the Methodist preachers' meet
ing.
Evangelist Mnnhall was the speaker at
the Baptist preachers' conference.
At the Christian ministers' meeting yes
terday, a paper on "The Kingdom of
Heaven" was read by Rev. Prank S. Ford
of the First Christian Church. A com
mittee of throe, consisting ol Rev. Dr. W.
A. Gardner, Rev. S. M. Jefferson and H.
V. Morgan, were appointed to confer with
a like conimiitee of the Baptist Ministers'
Association regarding a proposal to hold
joint meetings.
A communication from the Presbyte

THOUSANDS SEEK
OLD ST. PATRICK'S
Its Silver Jubilee At
tended by Catholic
Throng 5.
Three Ceremonies Observed Yes
terday With Sermons at
Each.
Venerable Father Sc nlan Closes With
a Pi a for Immediate R?pen
tsnee of S ns.
Twenty-one hundred Catholics, slowly
moving and devout, issued last night in
steady streams from the tbres front en
trances to St. Patrick's Church, mingled
for a few moments upon the sidewalk and
then quietly dispersed, part going up and
part down Mission street, and srattering
out toward the different parts of the great
. parish, whence they had come earlier in
the evening.
It was the third time during the day
that such a concourse of worshipers had
come from the stately old edifice. Morn
ing, afternoon and evening those hun
dreds or others in their places bad assem
bled under the high-vaulted sanctuary to
particiDate in the simple but impressive
religious ceremonies connected with the
celebration of the twenty-fifth an niverÂ»ary
of the foundation of that towering, somber
Gothic pile.
At 9 a. m. moss was celebrated, and the
Rev. Joseph M. Gleason of St. Hose's
Church delivered a sermon upon "The
Time of Grace." His thought was that
there is no time so go d as the present in
which to turn to Goa. At 3r. M. there
was devotion of the "Way of the Cross"
and a sermon by the Rev. P. J. Keane of
St. Patrick's Church, who spoke of the
"Sorrows of Jesus." And at 7:30 p. M. t!ie
final services of the day were held.
They were not more impressive than
those that had preceded, but the scene was
perhaps more effective. Hundreds of tiny
gas flames twinkled over a broad, silent,
durk held of seated worshipers, and from
all parts of <he gorgeous, towering altar
sparkled and glinted tbe iights of candela
bra an I the gilded decorations upon which
they shone.
Every part of the extensive seating
space below and in the gallery was
thronged with women, men and young
persons intent upon their prayers or the
words of kindly admonition from the ven
erable father P. Scanlan of St. Joseph's
Church, who delivered the evening ser
mon .
He urged upon his hearers that they
act at once in renouncing their sins so
that with the advent of St. Patrick's day
and the silver jubilee of tne grand old
church named in honor of its patron saint
they might enter upon a life of purity
and untroubled conscience. During his
simple remarks he said:
We all know our own lives. We all know our
acts and our faults. Examine your consciences
to-night and see whttlier you are leading lives
that will blossom in the salvation of your
souls.
You can see for yourselves that if you wish
to profit by confession you should re
nounce your sins to-night. If we neglect this
opportunity now oJ renouncing our Bins who
will be responsible it we should die suddenly
nnd miss the j-alvation of our souls? We
know not when God may cf 11 upon v->. Now
is the time for you. He tells you to-night that
if you come to him with sorrow and confess
your sins he will grant you absolution. Listen
to ins voice to-night.
The service had begun the rosary,
during which the choir sang the myster
ies. After that Father Brennan of St.
Patrick's Church recited a prayer in
honor of St. Patrick.
About a hundred persons remained
after the services for confession, many
hundreds of others having presented
themselves all during the day.
To-day there will be services and ser
mons at the same hours as yesterday.
To-morrow, however, the great celebra
tion will take place. The occasion will
be particularly notable not only because
of the day and because of the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the erection of the big
church, but because of the assembling
from different parts of the State of all the
priests that, at one time or another in the
last twenty-five years, have been pas;ors
of St. Patrick's pari>h.
Would Oust a Professor.
Dissatisfaction bordering on a mild re
bellion has developed among the eighty
five students of the College of Pharmacy.
About fifty of them, urged and abetted
by a lew indignant individuals in tiie
senior class, liave ti?ned and submitted to
the board of di ectors of the institution a
complaint against theconductof Professor
John Calvert, who i aprens to have been
an esteemed member of the faculty for
twenty-five years and was one of the
founders of the college.
According to William M. Searby, the
dean of the faculty, the trouble started in
the senior class. He does not think
seriously of it at all nor that Professor
Calvert will be hurt by it.

MOVE DOUBT.
Melancholia, Hysteria and Other
Nervous Diseases V.inish Under
Its Subtle Charm
The fact that a delicate surgical opera
tion had been successfully performed a
few days ago upon Mr.". A. It. Ciothier
under hypnotic influence has caused con
siderable comment among the physicians
and sursreons in this City. It is hoped by
the majority of them that hypnotism as
a means of producing in-ensibility to pain
will be thoroughly investigated and prove
iiseltto be the mean-; by which both cap
ital and lesser surgical operation* may De
safely and successfully and yet absolutely
painlessly performed.
The lady who was recently operated
upon under this influence has shown no
signs of pain or collapse, nor does she
have the slightest remembrance of even
the minor details connected with the per- |
formance of the operaiion, which so fre- j
quently happens where chloroform or |
other anesthetics have been used.
"The mcst peculiar phase of all," said j
Dr. Ciark last evening, "is the fact that j
the post-hypnotic suggestions so thor
oughly control the patient so far as pain
following any operation is concerned.
"Where a paneir has undergone an opera
lion and is told that he or sne w>il feei
nbsolutely free from pain, nausea or ex
haustion at the time of awaking or re
covering there is never, or at least, hardly
ever any complaint made."
"Of course,'' be contiuned, "ths con
dition of the pat ent depends largely upon
the suggestions impressed upon the mind
just prior to the Una they ure permitted
io awake. If it is suggested to p:iiients
that they are being chloroformed be ore op
erating und this impression is not with
drawn from their mind, nausea and weak
ness will invariably follow precisely as
it v. ould had chloroform been admin
istered.
. "Hypnotism, or as it was formerly
railed mesmerism, is brought about
mainly by the subject himseir, but there
roust be aosolnte confidence paced in the
operator. Any person, whether strong- j
minded or otherwise, can easily resist !
hypnotic influence.
"The prevalent idea regarding hypno- !
tisni is that it is merely a weaker mind j
But j cted to the force or magnatism of a
siruiiger one, or again that one person
superabundant. y charged with ma<rnet'sm
may control another less fortunate, but
this is a mistake br"ti2ht about through
ignorance of the subject. Attain, the idea
lias been advanced that a sulj-ct once
hypnotized becomes more and more easiiy
affected by the operator in proportion to
ihe number of times he may have been
subjected to the treatment, but this is also
equally ridiculous. Any one can resist
the force at any piace or at any time, no
â¢maiter what may bo the condition of
their minds.
"That hypnotism will gradually im
press itself into public favor as a painless
aid 10 surgical opera. ions ttiere is no
doubt In my mind. It is often necessary
to 'prepare' a patient for a day or two, or
even a week, but the delay is counter
balanced by tiie fact that after prerara
tion and operation there is no danger of
heart failure, collapse nor any cf the
many symp:oms so common after the ad
minisirauon ol our modern anesthetic 9."
"I an) thoroughly convinced," said Dr.
Van Meier, 'that hypnotism is our great
est aid to 1 ainless operations. It is also a
remarkable factor in relieving and curing
nervoux troubles such as hysteria, stam
mering and melancholia. Hypnotism wi:l
in time supplant all anesthetics in minor 1
j-urgical operation-^, and many times in
those mosi difficult.
"Mrs. Clothier, upon whom I operated,
presented a peculiar phase to its influ- i
t-nce. Although inseiuibie to p*in wmle â¢
under the spell s. c asked permission to !
viake up, saying, "L t me wake up; 1.
have forgotten someuiing," and after tak- !
ing a drink of water she was soon again ;
insensible to everything, with the excep
lion of the presence of the hypnotist, j
Both mentaiuie were working â uer real- ;
ization of botu her condition a:id the lack
ol power or aesire to overcome it. An i
operator to successfully hypnotize a pa- j
tient must feei absolute. y certain of being j
Ã¼ble to accomplish what he Has started to '
do â that is, gain the perfect confidence of j
t c eu> ject â or all hU efforts will be in
vain. One who can gain perfect trust
from another thereoy removes the self- '
comrol of the patient, and his g:eatest
trouble is passed ever.
''Hypnotism has often relieved and
sometimes greatly benefited acute cases of
paralysis and its uses ai an aid to surgery
and medical treatment will gradually yet
surely take preference over all anes
thetics."
"The skepticism of rje large majority of ;
people," said Dr. W. A. Harvey, "will tend I
to r*tftrd she neneral uses to which hypno- j
mm may be success ully put, but its j
superiority to chloroform, cocaine or gas '
will eventually work us way into public
favor as a cure for nervous diaea-es and an
aid to surgery. Alter it becomes impressed
upon the public that there is an o
lutely no pain felt while under its influ- I
ence, tsic number of operations performed ;
without anesthetics will greatly increase. â 
"Another great advantage is that the j
patients can be hypnotized in a room free
irom the sight of tne dreaded operating I
chair and surgical nstruments and then 1
be induced to prepare himself for the or
deal, insensible to the surroundings, thus !
removing a sliook otherwise unavoidable." j
AGAINST THE BUCKET-SHOPS.
The Produce Kxchange Will >"ot Fur
nish Quotations to Outside Sharper*.
The members of the Produce Exchange
have determined to run the bucket-shops
out of business. There are in this City
half a dozen fellows who pretend to be
grain and produce dealers or brokers.
Th uninformed who desire to invest in
such com mod i ties as tne genuine dealers
handle are taken in and systematically
robbed by these bucket-shop sharpers,
who furnish fictitious or garbled reports
of quotations. This naturally hurts all
legitimate dealers and in the Produce Ex
cn&nge there is a written and an unwrit
ten law i hat none of the sharpers shall be
admitted to membership or allowed unon
th' 1 floor.
Yesterday there was still another effort
to root these fellows out of business.
A proposition was made to amend the
by-laws so as to prohibit the members of
the Produce Exchange from furnisiiing
any information as to quotations to the
bucket-shop sharks, or answer questions
from these fellows by telephone. It was
a poor time for bringing up a proposition
for changing the by-laws, for the at
tendance was not so large as usual, owing
to the press of outside business. A vote
on the proposed amendment showed that
the majority of those present were in
favor of this stringent rule, being 35 for
and only 10 against the change.
The reason that it failed to pass was De
cause a quorum â 50 membersâ was not
present, and it requires a two-thirds na
jority to amend the by-laws. The matter
will be brought Up again to-dar, and it
is expected tuat it will be passed by a very
large vote.
MANY TIMES EXPLAINED.
Difficulty Experienced by a Fair Young
Client in Understanding an Order
of Court.
Owing to incompatibility of tempera
ment Messrs. Hillyer & Jacobs have
sought to be relieved from their position
as attorneys fpr a young woman who is
administratrix of the estate of her mother.
As is customary in such cases the at
torneys have filed a written statement of
their services in order that the court may
understand the circumstances sufficiently
to fix a reasonable fee for the lawyers.
Tne affidavit was made out by Curtis
Hiilyer, a member of the firm, and he
appears to have unconsciously given a
touch of humor to his statement. In the
schedule twenly-one dates are specified
on which the lady was in consultation
with her lawyers. It appeared that she
was impatient over the restrictions of the
law touching her management of the
property, and she specially resented the
order of the court, which her attorney
seemingly approved, wnicn. required the
cash on hand to be deposited in oank, sub
ject to order of the Probate Court. For
this reason each interview with her at
torneys ended soineining like this: "Ex
plained why the administratrix had no
right to spen.l tier share of the estate be
fore it was distributed to uer, she being a
legatee; also why the court had ordered
the money dei osited in bank."
Finally the young lady decided that sho
wanted to get murried, and she thought
she ought to have $600 to prepare for that
event. Her attorneys advised that her
mother's funeral expenses would have to
be paid first: that wedding expense^ were
not preferred claims, but that the law re
lating to preferred claims took cognizance
of funeral expenses only, as usual, there
was an explanation of the question of
public policy, which led the court to order
all 'lie raon y deposited in bunk.
Finally Judge Coff^y, in whose court
the case was pending, sent for Mr. Hillyer
and said that his fair young client had
complained that she had no moii y with
which to prepare for her wedding, and
that besides she was starving. The court
suggested that as this is Lent she did not
require any great amount of food, and
that a* to the matr.monial question he
could rind no provision in the code which,
gnve mm jurisdiction.
The young lady thought she could find
other lawyers w o would help her out of
her predicament, and, Messrs. Jacobs &
Hillyer acquiescing, the court gave her
permission to make a change in accord
ance with her wish.

AFTER THE "SCALPERS"
Railroad Ticket Brokers Cham
pioned by Mayor
Phelan.
The Golden Ga'.e C rnival C mmittes
Wants Them Prevented From
Doing Business.
The ordinance prohibiting the sale of
railroad and steamship tickets by brokers
W; s discussed at a special session of the
License and Order Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday morning.
The executive committee of the Golden
Gate carnival was present to urge that the
ordinance be recommended. The mem
bers stated that they desired to secure
larger reductions ironi the railroad com
pany,for those who desired to attend the
carnival, and that the rai.roud was back
ward about making concessions as lon* as
the brokers were in business.
The ticket-bruk rs asked the committee
to consider the matter well before acting.
Their attorney stated that the ordinance
ii passed would drive many out of busi
ness, and thai the railroad company need
not tear any "scalping" of Â» xcursion tirk
ets to and from he carnival, as the brok
ers do not deal in tickets to ana from lo
cal points.
Mayor Phelan was present, and stated
that he had ascertuinad that the business
of the brokers was principally in tickets
to Eastern pom .Â«, and that they save the
traveling public $75,000 per year.
He favored some measure that would
protect the railroad company from scalp
ing tf excursion tickets to tne carnival,
but wis ay rse to any l<gislation that
would drive ihe brokers out of business.
Tne com 111 it tee reached no conclusion in
the matter.
SUSPENDED TOR FIVE DAYS.
The Penally lufl.ctr d on Captain Good
ell by the Koilrr luspector.
In the case of Captain Goodeli, master
pilot of the Union Transportation Com
pany's steamer Dauntless, charged witb
improper conduct, and of trusting the
safety of his passeneers to an officer with
out a certificate, Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers Bolles and Pnillips rendered the
following decision yesterday:
The charges were filod by one Clifford B.
Manges March 1, 1597, wiih additional
charges of misdemeanor on the part of Captain
<mo i.>u in connection with above matter and
at o'.h#r times.
After careful consideration of the evidence
taken, we find that Captain Goodeli was ne*
lectful of his duty in leaving the viioi-house
in charge of an uniicenstd mau at uifferent
times :tt a particular point in the San Joaquiti
River for the purpose of talcing his lunch. In
extenuation of tnat Captain Goodeli pleads
that no was away from tne pilot-house only a
short time, and gave orders to be called by one
blast or tool of the steam whittle if anything
came in sight.
For reason of the above neglect of duty on
the part of Captain George U. Goodell, we
have suspended hi* license as master and
pilot of s-team vessels for the period of five
diys. Said sufpension to commence March
Hi, 1897.
Ail the other charges of misbehavior ad
verted to herein are not sustained by the
testimony, and the same are therefore dis
missed and Captain Goodeli exonerated there
from.

The Government survey boat McArthur
to-day completed the entrance sheet to
the bay of San Francisco by investigating
a suspicious spot off Tennessee Cove, with
the result that no rock was found. Dur

been encaged in surveying and developing
all the dangers in the bay north of
Hunters Point, and from now on the work
will be from that point south to ban Ma'.eo.
DuriiiK this time the vessel has made
not less than 3000 miles of sounding, with
the result tint sunken danger* have been

and he was consequently turned over to
an 1 fficer sent over for him. The hand
cuffs were placed on his hands and he was
taken over on ihe 11 a. m. boat.
John AlcLaughlin was arrested Satur
day night for being drunk, and two or
three nours later Robert Morgan was
brought in on a similar charge. Mc
\ Laughlin had 23 cents on him when
searched, but Morgan yie ded up $11 35.
Both the men are of about the same build
and both were put in the same cell.

When Morgan awoke he at once de

THEIR CAMPAIGN
IS OUTLINED
Anti-Saloon Leaguers Hold
an Enthusiastic
Meeting.
They Will Hold a Convention
and Organ :z> This City
and County.
Anzicus to Secure Catholic Co-Oper
ationâSpeakers All Hop ful
of Success.
A large and enthusiastic meeting of the
State Anti-Saloon League was held yester
day at the Y. M. C. A. building. A num
ber of prominent preachers from this City
and neighboring towns were present as
well as laymen interested in the move
ment, and the Woman's Temperance
Union, which had postponed its confer
ence for the occasion, had sent a laree del
egation ot member?.
In addition to speeches by temperance
advocates a plan of campaign for the next
few months was outlined.
Rev. Dr. Bovard stated that H. H. Rus
sell, Ohio superintendent of the National
Anti-Saloon League, would spend June in
Caliornia, and suggested that he should
sneak throughout the State under the au
spices ot tne State organization, and that
an Anti-Saloon Convention should be
held in this City on the sth and 6:h of
July. This daio was suggested in order
tbut Christian Endeavor delegates might
combine attendance at both conventions.
"I think," said Dr. Bovard, "if we hang I
together we can uuike California feel the
power of this association."
It was re-olved to hold the convention
as Dr. Bovard suggested, and the hearty
co-operation of the State League wai
promised Mr. Russell in his tour of Cali
fornia.
Rev Dr. Dille made an ardent address,
describing the large area of this City
which is coveied with saloons, which he
declared to be "the power that blocks the
church, obstructs missionary work and
wrecks homes."
Alluding to tho Anti-saloon League, the
doctor compared it. to David, a stripling
which would overthrow the enemy.
RfV. Dr. Cnapman gave a detailed
account of the Sunday closing movement
in Oakland, and predicted that at the next
election the friends of the movement
woula carry the polls.
Dr. Bovard suggested organizing the
City and County of Stn Franci-co, as well
as Alameda County, and expressed the
hope that in time all the counties through
out the State would be organized. After
considerable dscussion it was resolved to
appoint a committee to organize the City
and Coun'y of San Francisco, but as a
strong desire was expressed to secure the
co-operation of Catholics in the move
ment, the committee was empowered to
change it< m earners and add t<> its num
bers as the members saw tit. The fo.low
ing ladies and gentlemen were appointed:
Rev. Dr. Beard, Rev. Dr. Dille, Rev. H.
Bevier, Rev. Dr. Gardener, Rev. M. P.
Bovnton, Mrs. Rose French and Mrs. H.
H. Lnse.
Rev. J. W. Webb of Fresno was ap
pointed State superintendent of the work
of the organization.

Words From a Stranger Smoothed the
..- ; \ :.â  . , , Way. :' ;
An elderly gentleman of fine presence
sat in the business office of one of the
largest grocery-stores in an" Eastern, city
engaged in social converse with one of the
proprietors. They were old friends autl
were renewing the old friendship.
A salesman came into the office and
presented his business to th? grocer, hand-
ing him a card showing a table set with
viands, while the words "Postum Cereal 1 '
and two red disks appeared underneath.
. In a few words the salesman stated that
his firm was desirous of having the grocer
handle "Postum'' in a large way. The
friend and visitor suddenly spoke up and
said, "Will, if you ; never soil that you
have missed a good thing. We use
It at home, and I have drunk it for four
months past in place of coffee because
coffee disagreed with me. People in my
town use the food-drink quite universally,
and you can depend on my word that it is
pure, nourishing and hetlthful. - It is
made in Battle Creek, Mich.,' wholly of

coffee as none of the harmful effects of
coffee." . â  * . â  -.- _

Mr. Schill's statement is but one among hundreds that have teen received from
people who are overjoyed at being cured of ailments such as Asthma, Bronchitis,
Catarrh, Neuralgia, Heart Disease, Eye Disease, Skin Disease, Rheumatism, Mala-
ria, Nervous Diseases, Kidney Diseases. Insomnia, Hysteria, Dysentery, Paralysis, â¢-
Rickets, Scrofula, Consumption, Liver Diseases, Diseases of Bowels, Ovarian Disk
eases, Sciatica.. Tumors and Abnormal Growth, Deformities, Spinal Disease, Varico-M
cele and Rupture, which have proved too stubborn for other medical skill. '
.A. DOCTOR'S < : t.:Krx3xrG-. !
Under no circumstances should the Electro-Medical Cure be confounded with the
ordinary electric treatment as applied by common batteries or with such crude mag-
netic app iances as electric belts and the like. The Electro-Medical Cure is different
in fundamental principle, different in application and different in effect. It is adapted
to the old and the young, the nervous, bilious, lymphatic ; in fact, to each and every
condition of therhuman system. By this discovery medicine is not distributed indis-
criminately throughout the system, but is passed directly to the diseased parts.
SCIENTIFIC : *IjI-A.3>O"CE!SÂ».
The expense of static batteries and more advanced delicate and costly electrical
mechanism prevents the larger proportion of the medical fraternity from purchasing
them. Herein the State Electro-Medical Institute excels, as it possesses the finest
electrical plant in the world. Their use of these appliances in the administration of
medicine, or what is known to the scientific world as the Electro-Medical Cure, is the
result of expensive and exhaustive experimental research. The Ray has proved
itself, in the hands of specialists of the Institute, of inestimable value- in determin-
ing the location and character of disease. .
HOME TREATMENT.
If you cannot visic the Institute, write for the neat and effective body battery,
which can be worn under the clothing, next to the skin, day and night. The poles
of the battery are placed on the medicine-pads ; the electricity passes through them,
carrying the medicine right to the diseased parts, 1 giving almost immediate relief and
effecting cures where all other kinds of treatment nave failed.

THE PRIZE-FIGHT
Seme Few Special Parties
Start on a "Mountain
Pilgrimage."
The Owl Club and Its Merry
Mmbers Will Be Well
Represented.
J mes L Flcod Will Carry His Friends
to Carson in H s Private Car
Del Monte.
The first special train out of this City
for Carson and the Corbett-Fitzs.mmons
tight started last night at U o'clock.
It was made up of eight cars, six of
which carried the ordinary passengers
and the other two will be devoted to the
exclusive use of t c "Owl Club."
The latter institution sprang up like a
mushroom, between two days, when the
"fight 01 the century" was decided upon.
It is not an incorporated club, and like a
rose its life will be only a period of four
days. But it will be a merry life if indi
cations go lor anything.
Douglas White, a newspaperman and
general gooa fellow, fathered tne scheme,
and he has gathered about him a score or
two of the best fellows about town to
make a party. Each is furnished with a
badge reading:
OWL CLUB
Mourtaiu Pilgrimage.
San Fbascisco, California,
to
Caeson, Nevada.
March 15, 16. 17, 18, 1897.
The Owl Club has secured two of the
finest cars used by the Southern Pacific
over the oveiland route. The "Buena
Ventura" is composed of the kitchen, a
dining-room and the commissary depart
ment. Marriott, the famous colored chef,
is admiral of this vessel and his crew con-
Bits of a steward and four waiters.
The "Astoria" is the name of the other
car, an elegant Pullman with two spacious
drawing-rooms, an observation lobby and
reading-room.
The members of the Owl Cluo who are
booked on the "mountain pilgrim
age" are Joseph P. Keily, ex-Judue Walter
Levy, W. Hanson, E, Trask, Percy Mor
gan, J. Lachman, Charles F. Hanlon, D.
Uanion, J. 1). Sullivan, Herbert
Choynski, Louis Metzger, John and
Joseph Kenueay, Senator Eugene Bert,
Ma tin fetevens, l)r. Gallwev, Herman
Denhardi, "Pop" Sullivan, D.ck Miller,
Paul Oesting, Phil Livineton, J. Gold
stein, Jim Dunne, Dr. Sweeney, Dave
Bachman, S. Sachs, D. J. Tobin, William
Miller, Billy Cook, Young Mitchell,
Charles Green. Fred Butz, John Mc-
Mahon, Biiiy George, Owen Hogle, Carl
ton C. Crane. W. J. Kennedy, 'William
O'Donnell and Douglas White.
The club expects to be away four days
and nights and no expense has been
spared to make the "pilgrimage" to the
lighters' Mecca and return an enjoyable
one.
The Harvey & White party, consisting
of twenty-two people from Silver City
>*. Mex., reacned here Saturday over .he
Santa Fe road and will be tacked onto the
Owl Club train. L. W. Liitle and Ira
Blizard, of Denver, Colo., will also join
tue party.
To-nigut James Flood's party will
leave here in the young millionaire's
private car, the Del Monte. Tne party is
small bat quite select. It consists" of
James Flood, Henry Ash, Nat Messer,
John Far ey and Police Commissioner
Moses A. Gunst.
The last special train to leave here
to-night is the "deadhead" car, that
will carry the railroad agents and tneir
friends.
The party will include: Thomas Tiliey,
W. R. V.cc, A. Ottinger, W. N- Price,
'William Marcey, W H. Snedaker, Fred
erick Thompson, J. Adams, P. I). Mc-
Carty, Timothy Mcc ; Hany Buck, Alex
ander Waters, Jack Kapus, George Lipp
man, Charles Miles, Malone Joyce and
Charley Kingsley.
Near;y all the p -ople mentioned above
as going to the right will wait until the
ringside is reached before making any in
vestment.
Up to 5 p. M. yesterday twelve special
Pullman cars had been sold for the 4:30
train this evening. Besides that there is
a car to go from Sacramento, one from
Marysville and another from Stockton.
Tue train out for Reno this morning will,
it is said, carry twelve or thirteen day
coaches for the patrons of the road.
Members of the Bohemian Club have
chartered one special car and members of
tee Pacific Union another for the right.
These cars will be hitched in the regular 6
o'clock train to-night. The 17th is to be
the greatest day oi all the year.
Tiie betting is slow on the result of the
fight. Abe Dani Is, an associate of Phil
PÂ«ryer, the horseman, and the backer of
Corbeit for many years, wae?red $500 on
Corbett at even money. The other end of
the wager is held by Arthur Wheelock, a
brother of Dan Stuart's partner. The only
odds given in this case is that Wbeelocfc
cannot lose unless Fitzsimmons gets
whipped after the tenth round.
Mose Gunst has the heaviest wager yet
made in tiiis City. He contracted for it
the night ot the Fitzsimmons-Sbarkey
fight when he wagereU $3000 even tnat
Corbeit would win.
Otherwise there is little money changing
hands, the CnrDett men demanding |8
against $10, and the Fnzsimmons people
insisting on giving but $7.
Fred Webster's train No. 1, with ten
members of the Pacific-Union Club, will
leave this afternoon.
Charles Asber"* train No. 2 will start at
4:30 o'clock with ihe following people:
Charles Astier. Sol Jacobs General Malow
ansky, Phi. Howeil, T. Coulter, Mr. True
of San Joe, Mr. Suiis of San JoÃe, Eugene
Korn, Harry Hoffman and Messrs. John
son and Smith.

BUDDHISM IN INDIA.
Rev. DharmapiU's DlÂ»conne on the
Religions of the Orient.
Tbe Buddhist priest, Rev. H. Dhnrma
pala, leciured Sunday night at the Native
Pins' Hall on the "Religions of India."
He had a large audience and was listened
to with profound attention.
There is very little Buddhism in India,
he said. When he went into the country
there was practically none, but he was
pleased to be able to say that there was
some revival of pure Buddhi-m there
now, and the birthday of the great teacher
was largely celebrated.
The great number of religious and philo
sophical sects were classed by the spexker
under these general head*: The mono
thsists, who bcli-ve in Braha ns the
creator of all things; the pessimists, who
believe in predestinatiou and lead lives of
severÂ» asceticism; and the materialists,
who deny immortality and teac.i the wis
dom of eating, druiKing and being merry
while life lasts.

Joacbinisen's court yesterday afternoon,
ex-Judge Levy real an affidavit on behalf
of the defendant, asking for a change of
venue.
It was alleged in the affidavit that the
! defendant believed he could not get a fair
and impartial trial before Judge Joachim
sen; that the Juice bad said to divers
persons that the defendant was a brute
and would be held for trial, arid that the
Judge had shown a vindictive spirit to
ward the defendant since they had known
each other in Fre no. ,
Attorney Ackerman for the prosecution
said he had no objection to the case being
transferred to another court, as he wanted
the defendant to get a fair hearing. He
was willing to submit to any ruling of the
court. ,
The Judge denied that he had charac-
I terized the d fendant us a brute or that
I there was any prejudice in his mind
j against him. He could not understand
I why the affidavit had not been presented
weeks ago when the case was first called.
He had no particular desire to try .the
case and he referred ex-Judge Levy to
Presiding Judge Low to tix the court to
which it should be transferred.
Ei-Judge Levy asked Judge Campbell
to take the case, but he refused, and Judge
Low will have to hear it himself as Attor
ney Ackerman objected to Judge Conlan.
Attorney Grady is charged with biting
off the ear of William Schaer, a waiter
in the Orpheum annex several weeks ago.
SCHOOL BOARD ECONOMY
Workmen Will On'y Be Em
ployed oa Half Time for
Some Months.
Directors Burns and Waller Ex inline
Building Sites West of
Castro Street.
Drastic economic measures have been
decided on by the Buildings ond Grounds
Committee of the Board of Education in
order to stave off to as great an extent as
possible the tnreatened deficit in the
School Department funds.
At a meeting of ihe committee yesterday
morning the matter was discussed at
iengtb, and it was decided to reduce the
force of men under the jurisdiction of the
committee about one-half. Chairman
Burns stated that the work on school
buildings and grounds left over by the old
boaid had practically been caught up with,
and that under the circumstances it would
be feasible to reduce the force materially.
He stated that a careful review oi the
sir nation showed that after the short va
cation which begins nrxi week at least
fifteen men cnuid be dispensed with. It
was debated whether or not to select fifteen
men and let them out entirely or to work
the entire thirty on half time, and the
latter plan was decided upon.
Each crew will work two weeks in the
month until the work on hand and the
condiiion cf the funds permi's the em
ployment of the entire force. This order
of affairs will also affect the men under
the control of the Committee on Supplies.
On Sunday, at the request of the West
of Castio street Improvement Club, Chair
man Burns of the Buildings and Grounds
Committee, Chairman Wuller of the Fi
nance Committee and John J. O'Brien.
Inspector of Buildings, made a tour of thÂ«
district represented by the club for the
purpose of looking into the matter of a
school swte for the locality.
A petition for a new school west of
Castro street was put in some time ago,
and it is probabie that the matter will be
reported favorably upon by the two com
mittees and the Duiiding provided for in
the next appropriation.
THE PAPERS MISSING.
Sudden Hitch in the Last or the Suit*
of the Hale A Norcroia
Litigation.
The latest of the Hale & Norcross suits
has come to a sudden hitch, because not
one of the papers filed in the salt can bo
found. They have been taken from the
County Clerk's offlc?.
The missing papers are those that were
filed last week in the suit brought by M.
\V. Foi to restrain certain persons from
voting stock that they ho d in trust at the
annual election of the Hale & Norcross
Mining Company. Fox tiled a complaint
charging a conspiracy on the part of Al
vinza Hayward, Robert Grayson and oth
ers 10 get control of the mine, and asking
that tney be enjoined from voting tlie
stock he din trust. The defendants tiled
an answer denying a conspiracy, and
charg ng that the plaintiff had illegally
obstructed the election. He also tiled a
notice of motion to dissolve the injunc
tion that had been issued, and asked that
Fox be enjoined from further ir.terierencc.
Saturday last the case wns arcued be
fore Judge Slack, and it was then an
nounced that the papers hnd been mislaid
and could not be produced. Yesterday
morning another rfquest for he papers
was made, and then it was announced
that th â â¢>â¢ had actually disappeared.
By agreement copies of the missing doc
uments will be filed, as o' the dates of the
originals, and the case will proofed. The
1 1st- f i has done no one any good, nor has it
harmed any one.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
FA VORITES BEGAN
THE WEEK WELL
Five First Choices in Front
at Emeryville
Track.
Jockey Thorps Was in Rare
Form, Piloting Four of
the Winners.
Ray el Salto Won With Eas â Encino,
at Olds of ioo to I, Beaten but
a Head by Lcvdal.
Six races furnish ample opportunity
to win or lose a few dollars ariund a race
track. Seven events were down on the
card at Emeryville yesterday, and with
tedious waits and exasperating delays at
the post It was nearly 7 o'clock be:ore the
majority of the crowd, hungry and in
anything but a cheery mood, landed on
this side.
The racing, while not presenting any
high-class fields, was above tha average.
Five favorites headed their fields past the
stand, and the regulars are temporarily
possessed of considerable means. The
bookmakers, however, extended to them
a pressing invitation to again be present
to-day.
Jockey Charley Thorpe maintained his
high average and still further increased
his popularity by riding four winners past
the finishing post in front. Thorpe has
many followers and they were wallowing
in c4over.
The sport opened with a iix-furlong
spin for maiden three-year-olds, in which
Velox, backed to 13 to 5 favoritism, showed
j to be the best of a poor lot and won
handily from Cogent, a 10 to 1 outsider.
.Major Fludd. the second choice, finished
bacK in the ruck.
A six-furlong affair under selling condi
tions followed, resulting in an easy win
for Altamax, the 9 to 10 choice, riduen by
Thorpe. Peril snowed a high turn of
speed as usual out in front, but stopped
badly at the end, finishing over two
lengths behind the favorite in 1:15%. Don
Clarencio took the show.
The third event was another six-furlong
run for maiden three-year-old*, lulare
was a 2 to 1 favorite in the betting, and,
after having the 30 to 1 shot Fanny S
ueaten forty yards from the wire, Hen
nessy, who had the mount, overlooked
seeing St. Distaff coming on the outside,
and was nipped out a head on the wire.
The winner receded in the betting from
â¢iy 2 to 5 to i.
I'ne rncy Rey el Salto took the four
furlong scramble lor two-year-olds, hands
down. Coupled with his stable com
panion, Loa Prietos, the ring laid 2to 1
agaln-t the Baldwin entries. Rey el Salto
quicKly rushed to the front after the start
an 1, never extended, passed the wire first
by three lengths in 49 seconds. In a hard
drive Little T G headed out the second
cnoice, Gypceiver, for the place.
In the miie iun that was next decided
THE "CALL" RACING GUIDE.
CALIFORNIA JOCKEY CLUB. Oakland Racetrack, no nilay. March 15- Flftyelffhth Day
of the Winter Meeti njj. i896>97. Weather fine. Track fast.
Lovdal, the even money choice, showed
that be wan many pounds the best of seven
starters. Gut off and knocked about at
the first turn, and again shut > ff entering
tbe stretch, Thorpe got un just in time to
beat the ICO to 1 shot, Encino, a head.
Logan, which was extensively played on
a tip that Ihe "iron horse" had regained
his old form, was third, only a neck far
ther away.
A'o Stemler's fast filly, Scotch Rose, was
the most pronounced sort of a favorite for
the rive-furlong sprint that cams next.
She had the field at her mercy from the
start, find won under wraps from Chenille.
Etta H, tne second choice, away from the
post poorly, was coming, very fast at the
eii'i, being beaten but a head for the place.
The final six-furlong selling event devel
oped the surprise of tbe afternoon. It
looked a soft spot for Caliente and the
books soon rubbed the even money offered
down to 4to 5. Mike Henneasy managed
to get Howard, a 10 to 1 chance, away
from the post advantageously, and al
though the favorite was hard ridden by
Thorpe through the stretch could not over
haul the leader and succumbed by over
two lengths in 1:14%. Shaw landed Mer
cutio in third place.
KOTES.
The match race between Sir William
and The Cheat at four and a half fur
longs, each to carry 110 pounds, will be
decided at the track to-day at 1 o'clock.
The owner of each colt has $1000 posted
on the result.
The owner of Howard was cautioned by
the judges about Tiding poor jockeys on
bis horse at times, and then at intervals
putting up a good rider and stringing the
coin on his chances. If it continues the
entry of the horse will be refused.

THAT THEATER
HAT IS DOOMED
Supervisor Rottanzi Fathers
a Measure to Sup
press It.
Even Opera Bonnets Are Not
Exempt From the Opera
tions of the Order.
The Board Protests Against the
Department of Highway Bills
in the L?gisla'nre.
Monrn, ye ladies who love to exhibit
your monstrous masterpieces of the mil
liner's art at the play. The die is cast,
the sentence passed. The theater hat is
doomed.
The stern gaze of Supervisor Rottanzi
was obstructed at the opera the other
night and bis official wrath was roused.
Crane t: is neck as he rnuht he could catch
but fleeing glancas at "L' Africaine" and be
fore the curtain went down for the last
time he had determined on drastic meas
ures; he would abo .ish the towering bead
gear so dear to the feminine heart.
Bright and early the next morning he
hied himself to a man of law, learned in
Blackstone, Cooley and other authorities
on the ruins of man.
"Wrire me forthwith," he thundered,
"a lawâ a law that will cr-r-r-nsh the
theater hat by tue very weight of its
learning and verbiage.
"Make it broad, make it long, make it
far-reachine, and above ail make the pen
alty of violation heavy."
Then sat him down the man of brains
and evolved. Deep into books that reeked
| of legal lore he delved, and for hours he
j worked and labored.
The result came out at the Board of
Supervisors yesterday when the Super
visor from the Seventh Ward introduced
the following order:
Section 1. No person shall wear any hat or
bonnet or other head covering within any
licensed theater in v.is City and County dur
ing the time of performance In Raid theater or
during the rendition of any programme on the
stage or pUtform of said theater; but every
such hat, bonnet or other head-covering shall
be removed from t he head by the person wear
ing the same during the time of performance
I in said theater <>r during the rendition of the
i programme on the stage cr platform of said
theater; provided, however, that the above in
hibition shall not be htld to include skuilcaps,
lace coverings or other small or closely fitting
head dress or covering which does not inter
fere wnh or obstruct the view if the stage or
platform of sucn tneaier of persms in the rear
of such wearers while in such theater.
Sec. 2. No person, firm or corporation hav
ing the lease, management or control of any
licensed theater sha.l permit any person dur
ing the time of performance in such theater or
during the rendition of any programme on the
stage or platform ol said theater to wear any
hat, bonnet or covert ng for the he-id contrary
to the provisions of section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3. Any person who shall violate the
provisions of section 1 if this order shah be
adjudged guilty of misdemeanor, and upon
conviction shall bo punishable b- a fine of
not less than $3 nor more than $20, or im
prisonment in the County Jail for not more
than one day, or by both such fine and im
prisonment.
bee. 4. Any person who shall violate the
provisions of section 2 of this order shall be
KUllty of a misdemeanor, and upon convic
tion shall be punishable r>v a fine ot not less
than $10 nor more than $25, or imprisonment
in the County Jail for not less than two days
nor more than ten days, or Dy both such fine
and imprisonment.
Sec. 5. Any person who violates the provi
sions of section 1 of this order shall not ue ar
rested by any police or pence officer during
the progress ot thu performance or rendition
of any programme upon the stage or p'atfonn
of such thesur. but such person shall t>e ar
' rested at the conclusion of the performance or
I rendition of tne programme, provided, how
ever, that sucti person may be removed and
' ejected from the theater by the proprietor or
i manager ot such theater.
I bee. 6. This order shall take effect immedi
ately upon passage.
Most of the Supervisors are married
men ami some have grown-up daughters,
and they hesitated about voting on the
order.
Finally Supervisor Britt proposed that
it be referred to the Judiciary Committee,
and this course was taken despite the pro
test of Supervisor Rottanzi.
Supervisor Britt introduced the follow
ing resolution:
Whereas, Assembly bills 762, 903, 904 and
905, creating* State Impart men t of Higoways,
provide for a State tax, about one-third of
which is paid by tbe City and County of San
Fraucisco, and at the same time expressly ex
clude SÂ»n Francisco from tne benefits of the
act; and whereas, the streets ami roads of the
City and County of San Francisco do and will
require all of the money that can reasonab y
be raised by taxation; therefore, be it
Kesolved. That-theSiin Francisco delegation
at the Legislature be requested to oppose the
adoption of the bills unless the City and
County of San Francisco receive direct bene
fits proportional to the amount of her contri
bution to the fund.
The measure was adopted unanimously,
its author remarking that the department
sought to be created might better be called
the Department of Highway Robbery.
The board adopted a resolution offered
by Supervisor Devdtiy pledging the b ard
to open a boulevard 100 feet w do through
the Almshouae Tract so as to conipk-te the
boulevard for which Aaolph Sutro and the
Spring Valley Railroad Company hava
given laud. The resolution also pledges
the board to authorize the Driving Associ
ation to enter upon and open the thorough
fare through the Ciiy's property.

WORK EXPECTED
TO START TO-DAY
At Least Fifty Men Will
Commence on the
Boulevard.
Lists of the Men Engaged Will
Be Published From
Diy to Day.
UiKmp'oyed Appoint a Ccmmittee to
Consider Articles of Incor
poration.
A consignment of picks, shovels and
barrows, with a load of lumber, was de
livered upon the line of the Seventh
avenue boulevard yesterday afternoon.
Superintendent Thomas Eagen and his as
sistant were on the ground making; prepa
rations to start with about thirty men
this morning.
Work will be commenced at a point on
Corbett road, at the southwest corner of
the AJmshouse tract, and will be con
tinued southwest toward the Ingleside
road. The section between that point
and the park will not be touched for the
present.
This line of operation is deemed advis
able in consequence of there being a road- j
â way between those two points, whereas on :
tee stretch over which the new road is !
about to extend, there is no opening at
present.
By to-morrow morning it is expected
that as many as a hundred men will find
employment. This is but a fraction of |
the number who have registered as in j
need of work, some 1350 having placed |
their names on the committee's books.
A list of those required to report for â 
tickets admitting them to work on the
boulevard will be published in the morn- j
ing papers from day to day, and it is ex- j
pected that the fortunate ones whose i
names so appear will lose no time in mak
ing application at the bureau on Leides
dorft street.
Tne committee is more !han ever deter- â 
mined to exclude the unworthy from par- j
ticipation in the boulevard wort, and ,
every application is being carefully inves- |
tigated by the Salvation Army, the As- !
sociated Charities and tlie police. As a !
result of this over a hundred names have
been rejected. Some of the applicants :
gave false names and addresses; others
claimed to have wives and families, which
on inquiry proved to exist nowhere save
in the fevered imagination of the appli
cant, and probably pot even there; others
again were altogether too well known to
the police.
The applicants, whose names are ap
pended, will be put to work to-morrow
on procuring tickets from the barean to
day :

At last night's meeting of tbe unem
ployed at the armory a draft of the Arti
cles of incorporation prepared by T.
Rogers was presented and discussed and a
committee selected to examine it more
fully and report thereon this evening.
The general sentiment of tbe meeting
teemed decidediy in favor of the pro
posal.
A member of the organization named
Oliver was elected vice-chairman in place
of Davies, resigned.
In response to a call for a speech he ex
pressed himself a^ in favorof the proposed
scheme of incorporation, and of anything
that would tend to a more complete con
solidation of the forces of the unemployed.
He urged that the idle masses, not only
here, but all over the United Slates,
should present a brave front and demand
their rights. In San Francisco more par
ticularly he advised his colleagues to in
vade the fashionable quarters and bring
home tne extent and depth of the present
destitution to the minds of the wealthy.
Earlier in the evening a general report
from the Auditorium benefit was present
ed by Chairman Leffingweli. This showed
a sum of about $40 unaccounted for. The
holders of these tickets were appealed to
for an explanation and in some instances
confessed that ''potations pottle deep"
were responsible for the shortage and
another ingenious gentleman informed
the meeting that the money had slipped
through a hole in his pocket. The organ
ization forebore to increase the embar
rassment of the culprits and generously
exonerated them from blame.
Chairman Leffinewell stated that owing
to the absence of the manager of the
mines, with whom he is negotiating to
obtain employment for a large number of
men, nothing further could be done at the
moment.
The funds in the treasury now amount
to $242.
Six dollars was givei to the fund by the
teachers of the Columbia Grammar
School of this City.
Sirs, flagitn Mck.
Mrs. Mollie Hagan, who stabbed her hus
band, John Hagan, recently, and has been
in the City Pris-on since the stabbing, was
taken to the Receiving Hospital last night,
suffering from congestion of the lungs. Dr.
Fitzpibbon says she is in a high fever and is in
the first stage of pneumonia.
WILL CHRISTEN THE SHIP
i Miss Lucie Browj, a Wheeling j
Belie, Comes to Name a
New Gunboat.
AN-wspaper Correspondent Suggested
the Name " Wheeling " and Is
Here to Report.
Miss Brown, Miss Lucie S. Brown and i
Miss Marion Brown, young society women
of Wheelinc, W. Va., who have been visit
i iv.a, in Southern California for several
j months past, arrived at the Palace Hotel j
yesterday and will participate on Thurs
day noon in the launching at the Union
Iron Works of the United StateÃ war j
vessel Wheeling.
Miss Lucie S. Brown will christen the
i vessel by breauing the customary cham- ;
i pagne bottle over her bow as she glides ;
! into the bay at high tide. The Mayor of
: Wheeling -elected the young lady lor tbe ',
\ pleasant duty and notified her by lele
â¢' graph.
Upon the same occasion the Marietta,
| named after Marietta, Ohio, will be
j launched at the Union Iron Works.
Leroy J. McNeeley, who will be one of the
! representative* of the city of Wheeling at the
launching of the two gunboats, Wheeling and
! Marietta, has arrived here from Wash
i ington, I). C, and is staying at the Occi
: dental. He will report the launching for the
: Wheeling Evening News, of which he is the
i representative at the National capital. He
j has come to San Francisco to attend the
! launching, noi only for his paper and for the
j city, but because he has a peculiar interest in
! the occasion w ti ich will mark the advent of the
i vessel an a part of tne United States navy. It was
due principally to the efforts of Mr. JlcNeely
that the gunboat was named alter Wneeung,
the metropolis of the State of West Virginia.
He started the movement in his Washington
correspondence and it was through, his writ
lags that various |West Virginians of promi
nence Decame interested in the matter. He se
cured the co-operation of the City Council and
other official bodies in Wheeling and tnus ob
tained aid and support for the movement
which he undertook alone. He also solicited
the help oi West Virginia Senators and mem-
I bers of Congress and had them each file a
i strong indorsement of the request that the
name Wheeling be selected. Hon. William L.
Wilson, late Postmaster-General, is a distin
guished West Virginian and he became inter
ested in the proposition through the work of
the jtmng newspaper correspondent, and al
though there were as many as two dozen cliles
asking for the honor it Is said that Wheeling
made ihe Btrongest snowing of them all. This
is the first time a newspaper correspondent at
Washington has been t>uccessful in having a
United States war vessel named.
When seen by a representative of Thb Call
Mr. McN'eely said:
"The people of Wheeling are very much elated
I over the success they have achieved and al
j though it is now over four months since the
vessel was named their enthusiasm has not
been abated one whit. They all regret that it
is not possible for them to be present, as this
launching is an event in which they are
much interested. But they intend to send a
I committee of ten Couucilmen loSan Francisco
I whenever the boat is ready for commissioning
; and at that time they wnl turn over to the
ship's officers the testimonial the city has
prepared. Tills will be composed oi a silver
punch bowl and a set of glass and china ware
made in the Wheeling factories and modelea
after the latest design. In 1880 the popula
tion of Wheeling was 30,737 and in 1890 it
was 34,522. Since the last census there has
been a proportionate increase. Wheeling is
onu of the chief cities of the Ohio Valley.
"it is known for its manulacturing industries
and long ago earned the sobriquet of the
â¢Nail City' as a result of its uudi-puted claim
to be the possessor of the most extensive nail
shops ni the world. The city is also celebrated
for its pottery, its china and glassware, but
these are the chief and not the only industries
it maintains. It has extensive iron and steel
rolling-mills and a number of large tobacco
factories. Another important manufacture
which is rapidly being extended is the making
of sheet metal ceiling and roofing. This
fancy-designed, fireproof ceiling which is so
popular to-day had HÂ» first growth within the
gates of Wheeling, and in that city it is recog
nized as certain to gain in importance. Many
other smaller but none the less valuable man
ufactures are engaged in to an extent that
makes the Nail City a decided rival of Pitts
burg and otner cities on the Ohio River."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897,
Where the Unemployed Will Begin Work on the New-

YOUNG CADETS
AT CAMP DUBOCE
The Students of the Lowell
High School Trying
Military Life.
Finding Out by Personal Experi
ence What It Is to Bs Real
Soldiers.
An Attack by Pinole Indians and a
Repulseâ There Will Be a Stum
Battle To-Morrow.
"Camp Duboce" is the name over the
entrance to a pretty little spot in Niles
Canyon, Alameda County, on the north
bank of the San Lorenzo, on which the
Lowell High School cadnts, attached to
the First Infantry Regiment, Second
Brigade, have been in camp since last Sat
urday and where the corps will remain
until Thursday or Friday next.
The camp is in a most delightful loca
tion, environed by some of nature's
grandest scenery and well shaded by old
oak trees. The tents, twenty-live in
number, are piiched in two parallel lines
that front on a street that has been named
Lowell, after the school in which the
cadets are pupils. A color line has been
established and at thÂ« western end are
the quarters of the corporal of the guard,
while at the other end are the commis
sary's quarters. Facing the western end
of Lowell street is the tent assigned to
Firs' Lieutenant Marcus 8. Harloe of the
regimental staff, battalion adjutant of the
first battalion, wmo is acting as instructor
and advisory officer in place of Major
H. T. Sinie, who was prevented from at
tending to the functions assigned him by
re.ison of illness in his family.
Company orders are that on crossing the
color line all persons must salute the flags,
civilians aÂ» well as members of tbe corps,
and if civilians neglect to do so after be
ing notified by the sentry they will be
escorted off the grounds by the corporal's
guard.
Captain L. E. Edwards, who is in com
mand and is an enthusiast in all matters
appertaining to the National Guard, ex
pressed a determination before going into
camp that tbe members of his company
should have a week of strict military life,
not one of pleasure merely, but a week in
which they would learn some of the stern
realities of. a soldiers life. With that
idea in view he is following the rules laid
down by United States officers for the
government of military camps. In the
tents there are comfortable bedding of
fir-t-class hay, warm blankets and all that
is requisite for camp life, but no luxuries or
jimcracks, such as have been seen in the
tents of adult members of the guard at
other camps.
There is a military routine daily. Yes
terday there was the following:
6a. m., reveille ; 6 :15, rollcall ; C :30, inspec
tion of tents; 6:45, mess; 7:45, drili; 9, recall
and guard mount; 12 m., mess; 4:30 p. m., dress
parade; 0, mess; 7, retreat; 9:30, tattoo: 10,
taps.
The officers of tbe camp are Captain
L. E. Edward.9, commander; Lieutenant
George S. Lipuian, officer of tne day ; First
Sergeant Evans, adjutant, and Sergeant
Cowley, sergeant-major.
There will also be extended order drills,
skirmish drills, and all that is calculated
to impress on the minds of the cadets what
soldiers must know. The young men have
shown a willingness to perform all their
duties with military exactitude, and up to
4 o'clock yesterday tnere had not been a
violation thr.t called for punishment by
detention in the guardhouse.
On Saturday the cadets went by boat
and train as far as Hay wards and from
there marched to the camp site, distant
about eleven miles by the road. They
started at 10:40 a. m. and reached their
destination at 3in tbe afternoon, resting
on the way 45 minutes for lunch, and tak
ing two other rests of 15 minutes each.
They covered the distance at the rate of
four miles an hour, route step, which is
half a mile better than the time of regu
lars. Lieutenant Harloe, who accom
panied them, said that he expected to see
several of the cadets drop by the wayside,
but they grittily stuck it out and when
they caught sight of camp they tried to
give three cheers, but it was only a feeble
effort, they were too tired. Alter a few
hours' rest and a good, plain, substantial
dinner they felt "as good as new."
On Sunday nearly all the cadets went to
Niies to attend church service, ai.d in the
afternoon they were visited by nearly
everybody in Niles. The Postmaster of
that place and others, who are members
of a football team there, suggested a game
of football. Tne cadets, who averaged 130
pounds each, made up a team which con
tested with the Nileites, who averaged iBS
pounds each. Although there was no
touchdown, tbe ball at the close of the
game was twenty feet on the cadets' terri
tory.
After the game the belles of Nites and
the young boys in blue had a dance in the
picnic pavilion, music being furnished by
three harmonicas.
During the evening the camp was
visited by a band of Indians from Pinole,
and the cadets feared that they had come
to carry away the contents of the com
missary tent. Consequently a call was
made for volunteer guards, and every
member of the compeny answered
"Ready !" to defendâ their rations. The
Indians came within the color line, and
the cadets, taking them for the enemy,
charged on them and drove them down
the road. While this was being done
three cadets, wishing to test how much
sand their companions had, nid them
selves iv tne brush and suddenly gave an
Indian yell. All of the guard stood man
fully at their posts on t.e defensive ex
cept one, who, when he beard the yells,
dropped his musket and commenced to
cry. When asked if he was afraid he
answered that he was not, but that he
had eaten a preen apple and it bad given
him a colic. His fellow-cadets take no
stock in the apple story and insist that he
was suffering from Indian scare.
Henry Auerbach, who is known as the

the guard on Sunday" night, but it was a
signal failure, and now he shows a bayo
net hole in one of his pantaloon lega to
substantiate his assertion that the guard
was attending strictly to business.
During the afternoon of Sunday the
camp was visited by Lieutenant-Colonel
Duboce, who has taken a great deal of
interest jji the cadet company. He made
a number of suggestions about camp life
and work which will be oi benent to the
young soldiers.
The cadets have been provided with 500
rounds of blank cartridges and to-morrow
they will have a sham battle, and as camp
will be open to visitors they expect to
have many at Camp Duboce to see them
maneuver and present held movements.
THEY WERE NOT ENJOINED
Gibbs and Groom Still Retain
the Lease to Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Cycle Race Meet Will Be Held D â¢
spite Velodrome Management ;
Protestations.
Sporting men, club men and racing
men who went to the City Hall yesterday
morning to witness the battle at law sched
uled to take place between the Velodrome
management and; the â¢, San .Francisco
Amusement Association met with disap
pointment. It was reported that the Vel
odrome Company, through its attorney,
Thomas D. Riordan, would file three suits
against Gibbs and Groom of the San Fran-
Cisco Amusement Association. . *'â¢
The lir.it was to be for an injunction
against R. M. Welch of the League of
American Wheelmen to enjoin him from
issuing to the San Francisco Association
sanction to hold an indoor cycle meet.
The second was to enjoin the Mechanics'
Institute from leasing the Pavilion to the
company, and the third was to be directed
against Gibbs and Groom.
No suits were riled, however, or at least
G.bb* and Groom are unaware of any if
any have been tiled and are confident that
the wrath that consumes the Velodrome
people will never be cooled by judicial'
wisdom.
The Velodrome people allege that Gibbs
and Groom, who are stockholders in the
Velodrome, are guilty of fraud in securing
the lease of the pavilion and the sanction
to open tne meet. They claim Gibbs and
Groom were acting as agents for the
Velodrome management and are much
incensed at the alleged treachery.
They say they will ask the court to ap
point a receiver <to lake charge of the
business and see that the emoluments are
placed where they properly belong.
D. G. Snafer, who is managing the
coming , meet for Gibbs and Groom,
who constitute the San Francisco Amuse
ment Association, says that the admirers
of cycling can rest assured that, notwith
standing reports to the contrary, the in
door meet will open on the 20th inst., and
under the management of the San Fran
cisco Amusement Association.
"The Velodrome management is simply
throwing mud, spreading wet blankets
and endeavoring 10 throw the San Fran
cisco Amusement Company into disfavor
fora purpose," said Mr. Shafer last even
ing.
"The Velodrome Company had a chance
at one time to secure the Pavilion for an
indoor raoet, but failure in a similar en
terprisejsome time ago dampened their ar
dor, and not being composed of nervy
sports the company was not anxious to
again take a risk.
- "Gibbs and Groom, accompanied by W*.
B. Fawcett, who was : managing the pre
liminaries for the meet prior to my ar
rival in this City, leased the Pavilion in
good faith for the San Francisco Amuse
ment Association.
"They were not acting as agents for any
party or firm, and Mr. Fawcett, who is
now with the Velodrome people, is aware
of that fact, and was at the ; time the
lease was made.
"Regarding the statement that the
Velodrome has made a contract with one
ElwelJ, who is accredited with being the
only man on the coast who possesses the
knowledge requisite to build a track at the
Pavilion, I can say that although the
proposition of a contract may be correct,
the following statement is a fallacy.
;. "We have procured the services of both'
a civil engineer and a competent builder
to erect a track for us, and I am confident
that when it is finis it will surpass the
track at the Velodrome.
1 "The statement that the cycling men
will ride if they are assured that the
purses offered will bo paid, no matter who
has the management . of the meet, was
also false. The Velodrome people have
been unable to secure a cracK rider for
over two months. â¢ '

A NEW GAME FOR
THE POLITICIANS
iney Are All Eagerly
Studying the Stratton
Primary Law.
It Revolutionizes the Ways of
Practical Politics and
Conventions.
The Democratic "Outs" See in It a
Hope of Downing th? Kingly
Sam Rainey.
Stratton's primary election law has been
signed by Governor Budd and it is now
in full effect throughout the State, revo
lutionizing practical politics and chang
ing greatly the prospects and probabilities
attendant on a crowd of political am
bitions.
Primary elections in this State are now
hedged about with all the protection of
law and all the sacredness which guard
general elections. Although Kentucky
has a law regulating primary elections It
is not nearly so stringent as our new one,
which becomes a notable political experi
ment which will be widely watched and
studied.
The new law is supposed to be a mighty
blow nt boss rule and machine power and
something that will sweeten with
righteousness that foundation of the
American political system, that fountain
of political power, that sink of political
iniquity, the primaries. Only the trial of
the law can tell how the thing will work.
In Ban Francisco the especial practical
interest in the new law is being shown in
the Democratic camp in which Sam
Kidney's swelling form is perched, the
king, and in which the regular and in
evitable row 13 brewing with the ins on
one side and the "reformers" on tne
other. Perhaps the new primary election
law will smash the fat boss' machine, and
perhaps it wont. It ought to be able to
do so.
The big central jewel in. the law was in
tended to be the opportunity it gives for
any citizen to safely vote at a primary
with a surety that his vote will be
counted. The result is expected to be the
drawing into primary politics of the body
of the electors.
The Stratton law is the re-enactment of
the primary law passed two years ago and
overturned by the Supreme Court, but
with important mollifications and simpli
fication. The Ja-t primary law was framed
for a general law, but the inferior legis
lators objected to their counties being
burdened with a great additional expense
with no great need for the law, and so it
was made applicable to only San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles.
Upon thii ground it was knocked out.
The expense is now greatly lessened,
mainly by combining precincts and by
not paying election officers, and it has
been passed as a general law mandatory
throughout the Stale. The Republican
State Central Committee has been the
especial backer of the bill, and to Chair
man McLaughlln and Secretary Btep
pacher,.who have labored hard for it at
Sacramento, the result is largely due.
Political calculations are made far ahead,
and with the signing of the bill the plans
of the politicians have at once begun to
take shape according to the new condi
tions. The next election seems far off,
but the play for nominations and for con
trol of organizations has begun. Nine
months hence the names of thousands of
primary election officers will be regis
tered.
Hereafter primary elections will be con
ducted by sworn officers, under the gen
eral control of the Election Commission
ers or similar officers, and any act which
is an offense at a general election will be
an offense, with similar penalty, at a pri
mary election.
Primary elections will be general, and
all parties will hold their primaries at the
same time and place and under the con
trol of one set of officers.
No candidate can get on the official bal
lot, for the general election who is not
nominated by a convention created ac
cording to law and at the general primary
except he go on by petition as an "inde
pendent 1 ' candidate. Thus no organiza
tion has any discretion as to operating
under the law, and "appointed" conven
tions are of, the past. There is now but
one path to the convention ball.
Political conventions become legal enti
ties, and are classified as "State," "dis
trict" and "local." One of the things
that will revolutionize conventions "is
that no one may hold more than one
proxy in a convention. This and the
fact that each delegate will bear a legal
certificate of election with a red seal on
it is enough to make many a veteran pale.
No candidate who is nominated by a
convention and certified to by the Election
Commissioners can gei on the official bal
lot to be voted for until he has sworn that
he has not, from first to last, directly or
indirectly, before or at primary or conven
tion, spent in his own or his pai ty 's inter
est more than a specified small* percent
age of the salaiy of the office he wants.
The law in this regard is, in letter, as
stringent as ttie purity of elections law
regulating the expenditures ol candidates
after nomination, and he must file an
itemized account of all expenditures re at
tain to hi 3 party affairs or his own political
interests.
Another drastic and highly revolution*
ary feature is a section providing that no
one employed by the Government, State,
county or town within ninety days of the
primary shall be eligible tts a delegate to
any convention, and the penalty for so
acting is a fine of from $50 to $30 or im
prisonment for from twenty-five to 150
days or both. Some doubt the legality of
this, but it is an interesting effort at the
purification and freedom of political con
ventions and the cracking in advance of
slates.
Other important details of the new law
are as follows:
In Presidential years a general primary
election for delegates to all party State
conventions to choose delegates to Na
tional conventions, nominate electors,
etc shall be held on the last Tuesday in
Mcrch.
A primary eleotion leading up to State
conventions for State affairs shall be held
every four years on the second Tuasday in
July.
Primaries for local conventions shall be
called at proper times by the Election
Commissioners or the county officers who
perform similar duties.
All parties or organizations desiring to
hold conventions must at least twenty
days before the primary election tiie with
the Election Commissioners a notification
of the fact with proper trimmings.
Any new party or organization not hav
ing polled 3 per cent of the total vote at
tho -preceding election may be recognized
as a party entitled to the privileges and
protection of the law by filing a petition
signed by the required 3 per cent It thus
requires a respectable number of electors
to get up a political convention now.
The duties of the Election Commission
ers begin in January of each year during
which a general election is to be heid.
During :hat month they shall select from
the precinct registers the names of fifteen
elec;ors, divided as to party, put each
name on a folded slip and seal the slips in
an envelope, one envelope lor each pre
cinct. The envelope* are boxed and
sealed, and all the names put on a public
record.
Twenty days before elections five names
shall be drawn from each precinct. The
first shall be the inspector and his poll
tics will be a gamble. The two judges
and two clerks shall be of contrary politi
cal faith.
The names of these election officers shah
be published with the notice of election,
etc.
The election officers must serve if not
excused or be punished. Their only pay
will be a certificate of service giving ex
emption from jury duty for one year.
The political organizations shall appor
tion delegates, but there must be one con
vention delegate to each 200 voters.
No ballots except those prescribed and
approved may be used. Each party xrusi
provide and print its ballots, but each
party must use a separate distinctive color
ordered by the Election Commissioners.
The size and style are regulated.
The Election Commissioners must fur
nish a separate old-style ballot-box for
each party at each polling place. Each
box must be labeled wLh its party name
and all shall be in a row in plain sight
and so on. The polls shall be open from
7a. m. to sunset. The Election Commis
sioners locate polling-peaces but not in
saloons, and must furnish precinct regis
ters.
To vote an elector's name must be in
the precinct register used at the last gen
eral election. If he has moved he may be
translerred, and if he is just of age he
may get on the register. The test of a
voter's right to vote any party ticket
shall be his bona-nde present intention to
vote for the party nominees, which he
may declare on oath and then vote. An
official challenger for each party snail be
appointed and sworn.
There are many other regulations re
garding the voting and counting and
wrongdoing on the part of voter or
officer is a felony as at a general election.
The Secretary of State is required to
print for distribution 20 000 conies of the
law within thirty days of passage.
It is provided that ihree election pre
cincts may be combined at the primary at
the discretion of the Election Commission
ers. This ana the provision that election
officers shall not be paid confines the pub
lic expense to ballot-boxes, polling-place ,
advertising, a little stationery, tally
sheets and postage. In this City the ex
pense will be but a few thousand dollars.
Registrar Hiuton regards the law as prac
ticable.
Copies of the law are in keen demand
among the local politicians and naturally
so. It will be readily seen how greatly '
changed are the conditions under which
the future party central committees will
be created and controlled. It will be
quickly seen how different will be the
probable membership of the conventions
that will nominate State and county offi
cers next year and as a consequence how
different will likely be the tickets that
will go before the people. There is a
different game to be played against and
tactics must change.
OBOOORY BREAKAGE.
Ordinarily Five-Per Cent ; Likely to Be
More When Dropped.
Importers of crockery usually figure on
breakage at 5 per cent. Not very much
stuff is broken after it has been actually
received. Men become expert in handling
samples and stock, and they don't very
often drop things. The bulk of the break
age is in transportation. Crockery is
shipped chiefly in crates, casks and cases.
The familiar crockery crate is a package
peculiar to England and the United States.
Crockery Irom Continental Europe comes
mostly in caslcs and cases, though a little
of it comes in slatted Dozes something like
crates.
The crockery crates used in England
and this country make a very heavy pack
age, running from 700 to 1500 pounds, ac
cording to the goods packed in them;
hollow ware that cannot be nested, such
as toilet sets weighing the least,
and such things as plates, that can be
packed closely together with only the
straw intervening between the pieces,
weighing the most. Whoever has seen a
crockery crate handled must have ob
served that it is yielding; it sways and
gives more or less in the handling. It
might be supposed that crockery shipped
in a package like tb's, that does not
always preserve its form, would be more
likely to be broken, but it is said that this
yielding is to sorr.e extent a protection to
the goods; it takes up shock' that might
break things in unyielding packages. At
any event, the breakage in crates and in
rigid packages, such as casks, is about the
same.
Obviously a crockery package cannot De
dropped for any considerable distance
without danger oi at least cracking tome
of the things contained therein. There
was once being hoisted up to an upper loft
in the establishment of a New Nork
crockery importer a crate containing a
hundred dozen seven-inch plates. In
some way this crate got loose and fell
from the height of the tnird story to the
sub- basement When this crate was
opened it was found mat every one of the
1200 plates had been broken. â New York

A Scheme That Worked.
"Then you absolutely refuse to allow
your daughter to marry me?"
"I positively do!" roared the father.
"Urn ! I expected as muci," murmured
the young man, as be edged toward the
door. "I merely went through the formal
ity of asking you in order to avoid the
possibility of a suit for breach of prom
ise." â Philadelphia North American.
A business man of Toledo, 0., asserts that in his case
dyspepsia was an inheritance. He obtained his first sup.
ply of r
Ripans Tabules
from Chicago because he could not then find them in
Toledo. Now the druggists there all have them.
nes one of the little packages with him all the time, and
if he has that distressed feeling after a hearty meal, or a
headache, he takes a Tabule. "My wife also uses them,"
he writes, "and if my boy feels sick he asks for one."
LONELY OLD PEOPLE.
How the Sunset of Life May .Be Made
Most Charming. ,;.;
There are .many elderly ladies, whose
strength is feeble, whose digestion is poor
and for whom life has no pleasure. There
are others who are the ' very picture of
health. Do you know why?
It is not difficult to answer. The truth
is that healthy old people are those who
possess the most "vitality .-, and whose
digestions are "good. Women who are
weak in advanced years lack this vitality.
If they would be strong, tnev must gently
stimulate the system. Thousands of
elderly people havn discovered a way of
doing this, and some are giving other*
the benefit of their experience. >
Mr. Alfred P. Chapman oi 29 Hanover
street, Baltimore, says: "My grand
mother, who is now past 90 years of age,
has been using Duffy's pure malt whiskey
for some time pasiarid'it has acted almost
like a charm, giving her an appetite and
allaying all disorders of the stomach. I
am convinced that it is a splendid thine
for elderly reotlo who require a tonic as
well as a stimulant."
; Dr. S. Weir Mitchell recently said;
"The safest drink for people who wish to
enjoy a hale and hearty old age is pure
whiskey." It should be remembered,
however, that there is only one absolutely
pure whiskey and that is Duffy's pure
malt. It is a pure, healthful stimulant
whic builds up the system, restores lost
vitality and manes weak people strong
and well. s ' ' ' â¢

Fair People Want No Jury
in the Pencil Deeds
Case.
ODD TACTICS TO DELAY
THE TRIAL.
The Bonanza Interests Are Mer
cilessly Arraigned in
Court
THE DEEDS DEPOSITED WITH
JUDGE SLACK.
Attorney Delmas Declares a Special
Law Has Been Passed (o Crip
ple Mrs. Craven.
It was on the cards that the Craven
deeds chapter of the Fair case should have
'opened yesterday morning. Mrs. Craven
was ready, but the bonanza side was coy
and held off. Attorney Delmas, on behalf !
of the principal of the Mission Grammar j
School, shied his castor into the ring in I
the beginning and announced that he and i
his were ready for the fray, and even went !
so far as to deposit the famous pencil j
documents with Judge Slack as an evi
dence of good faith. He was willing at
that very moment to begin the big case
before a jury. It happens that the Fair
people wanted no jury, and it was behind
DELMAS Arraigns the Fair People on Their Efforts to Postpone the Trial of the Pencil Deeds.
this that they maneuvered the entire day
for delay. For their pains they were
peppered with hot shot in a way that was
great sport ior the onlookers.
Attorney Charles L. Wheeler bore the
burden of the assault and as attorney for
Miss Virginia Fair Wheeler is playing a
little legal game of shuttlecock. The fitht
on the deeds is directly between Mrs.
Craven and the executors of the big estate
in the form of a suit to eject them from
the possession of the two pieces of prop
erty to which she lays claim under the
deeds. At the last moment he is en
deavoring to play the part ol an inter
vener, as lawyers call it. In the hair
splitting of court precedure Wheeler has
raised the fine point that the young
heiress has some equitable rights, and that
these must be pat>sed upon by a court and
not a jury. _ ,
This was the plan pursued by Wheeler
yesterday and ihe end of it ffil tbat it
succeeded in a temporary postponement.
As a portion of the ruse, Wneeler read
iiaw and lawbooK references sufficient to
Aiive J udge Slack a day's work looking up
nbeTecords.
The Craven interests were not at all
pleased with these tactics, and invited
the battie on the spot. There was no
d Sire on their part to keep the Fair
children out of court, providing on the
otner hand they would not attempt to
delay the big trial any longer. The
challenge to begin the case, so long de
lavrU, was given without any conditions,
but it was not flccepied, and the result
was that Delmas reached for the Fair poll
and basted it without mercy.
"We want to go to trial," he began.
"We arÂ« ready now, th;s moment. We
want no more delay. It the children in
this case, or anybody else, desire to come
into this case to try it we have no objac
tion to their coming \n on two conditions
th*t their coming in shall produce no
delay of this already raucn-aelayed case,
and that their coining in shall not disturb
the order of trial which lias been agreed
upon between the parties to this case.
Now, with that understanding upon this
proposition, if Virginia Fair, or Theresa
Oeirichs, or Charles L. Fair, or anybody
else, desire to come into this case and
upon the record nle s>uch pleadings an
they please and participate ru the trinl as
they please, we have no objectionâ anon
the twofold condition that I renea; â 'hat
theft coming in shall not delay the tr;ai
at. this day, and that they -hail not de
prve Mrs. Craven ot the right whirl) she
obtained by stipulation of proceeding to
have her case heard before the tribunal
selecieii by b-jth parties for that purpose.
So tbat, if your Honor please, whether
I counsel on.th- other side who represent
Ith* intervenors will need to put them
selves or us to the necessity of further
argument upon that matter will alto
gether depend upon w:.at attitude they
ussume toward the two propositions that
I have made.
"They do not want this case to ba tried
before a jury. Charles L. Fair has al
ready made that statement. The sitter
to-day but re-echoes the sentiment of her
brother expressed last year. We wish this
case tried before a jury, and we now say
to the other side, after all these charges
that have been made o: the fraudulent
character of these instruments; a:ter the
criminal courts have been put in motion,
and our witnesses dragged before those
courts and subjected to information ; after
the Grand Jury has been buuv for weeks
examining into the genuineness of those
deeds, in secret conclave and ex parte,
where we are not heard; we have come to
day, in the broad light of day, to face you
before the triounal that mud ultimately
determine upon the guilt or innocence of
these parties. Tney are ready for triai.
"They are ready, thank God, for once to
meet the nccusaiions which have bee:i
made and by whic.i the public mind is
sought to be poisoned. They are ready to
stand or tail upon that proposition. And
after all these things have been done the
reputation, the character of all these wit
nesses has been befouled and besmirched; j
nfier every attempt has bpen made to stab
them in the back by secret and ex pxrte
proceeding, when they come beiorea court
under a stipulation which guarantees
them that rig t, you shrink from the or
deal and you do not want to face the par
ties that you have accused.
"Yon do not want to give them the trial
to whic i they are entitled in defense of
their reputation, in defense of their prop
erty, but the question transcends a ques
tion of property to-day â in defense of I
their reputation, in defense of their lib- j
erty, in defense of their character. You j
do not want a jury of their countrymen to
pass upon the question of their innocence
or their guilt. Was there ever a caso, if
your Honor please, in which an issue aris
ing in a case in a court of justice should
more appropriately be tried before a jury
than this?
"If these deeds are what they have been
said to be there are half a dozen felons in
this State who deserve to be behind the
bars of the Statu prison. The determina
tion of th^ issue in this civil case deter
mines their fate; for, if it shall be found
upon this trial that those deeds are forg- i
cries, the District Attorney of this County
would be derelict to his duty if he did not
at once tile informations or at least accusa
tions of a criminal character against these
parties. With sucn tremendous conse
quences, therefore, is the trial of the issue
fraught for all these parties â mother, her
daughter ana a venerable oid woman who
is at the point of death to-day, a young
| man whose character has been huherto
j stainless in this community and others â
all hang upon the trial of this issue. Their
liberty, their character, their reputations
are dependent upon it. Ail that they asE
! is, after these postponements, alter these
delays on account of absence, on account
of sicKness, on account of anything else, is
that they at least be given the privilege of
confronting ineir accusers and the mid
night assassins of their character; meet
them in the broad lace of day bei'orj that
tribunal which has been constituted and
recognized for hundreds of years as the
bulwark and protection of the weak against
the strong.
"The other side do not want that. At
the last hour they come to the conclusion
that a jury i 3 not the proper tribunal to
try this case. But, if your Honor please,
we make the proposition to them now,
here, to any and all of you wo say, we will
submit to a jury in that box tne single
question whether those deeds are genuine
or not. Ii matters not whether the issue
arises upon legal pleadings or upon equit
able pleadings, by cross-complaint or by
equitable defense, we will agree with you
to submit to-day that single question to a

their verdict is against us you may have

parties who nave participated in this fraud

"I do not care whether there is a peti
tion in intervention in equity or whether
it is at law; whether it is an action of
ejectment or whether it is an action to
cancel deed*. I care not; all that we say
is in some shape give us a trial; give us a
trial now. And all that we wish to try,
in any shape that you desire to put v, all
that we desire to submit to the jnry in any
form that will suit you, is the single ques
tion, Are these deeis genuine or forged?
If your Honor please, I appeal to your
Honor, and it will save an immense
amount f>f arguing and trouble in this
mutter. Your Honor has it in your power,
even if this should be conceded to oe an
equitable defense, or otherwise, your
Honor has it in your power to submit that
question to a jury. We w;iive all for
malities. Tell us that question shall be
submitted and we are ready to go on in
any way, shape or form. If these plead
ings give them the advantage of opening
and closing in the proof and in the argu
ment, let thtm have it.
"We are willing to give them Â«very ad
vantage that they can demand of us ex
cept two â don't wear us out by delay and
don't deprive us of the right to justify our
selves before the tribunal which the con
stitution and the laws have given us in
that respect; and, furthermore, don't pro
tract this case, if your Honor please, until
further special legislation shall be ob
tained in the halls at Sacramento in bills
to De signed by the associate counsel in
this case, the Governor of this State, to
hamstring U3 as has been done last weetc
and is contemplated to be done iurther."
The Fair side did not like the fire appar
ently, for G.irret McEuerney, the repre
sentative of Attorney Goodfellow, wanted
information about tiu3 matter of special
legislation.
"1 will toil youto|what I refer," said
Delmas in reply. "It is to the bill ap
proved March 4, 1897, to amend section
1207 of the Civil Code referring to transfer
of that property and fixing the time that
defective certificates of acknowledgment
sh II becom valid."
McEnerney â How does that refer to this
case ?
Delmasâ lt changes the Jaw of this
State, sir, as it has beeu on the statute
book for over thirty years. And by sav
ing that no certified copy of a record shall
be admissible in evidence until the genu
ineness of the instrument recorded shall
tirst have been provouâ a pro vision which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
exists in no State in the Union, and never
existed in Ihi3 Siate until this act was
passed.
MeEnerney â I want to say, so far as I
am concerned, that this is the first time I
ever heard of that statute in connection
with this case.
Delraasâ I refer yon, sir. further to an
act approved March 3, 1897, entitl d "An
act to amend section 12300f the Civil Code
of the State of California relative to the
recording of conveyances." I might refer
you further to a bill pending before the
Legislature and wnicn has passed both
houses, and which was awaiting last week.
I and which is awaiting the signature of
} the Governor to-day, unless he has signed
it this morning, by which ttie testimony
of our main witness. Mrs. Craven, is to be
cut off.
MeEnerneyâ l was waiting for counsel
I to refer to that bill, a copy of which I
have. That act was inciuded in the report
of the Code Commission. He refers to
Senator Aram's bill, No. 8, to amend sec
lion 1880 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Delmasâ l haven't any doubt, if your
Honor please, of the propriety of that bill;
I haven't any doubt of the justice of that
bill. Let us goon and try this case, and
I let us not delay it until that bill which has
been passed just now in order to suit the
exigÂ«ncies of this case is signed, whether
!it is just or unjust I make no doubt that
! these other bills are jmt, though their
j justice h is been hue discovered and dis
covered just in time to have the law passed
in order 10 be in effect alter the manif >ld
continuances that we have had here should
have passed.
The talk then drifted to dry law.
Wheeler entered a formal proposal that
Jud c Slack decide at once if it was a case
for a jury, and on these lines the lawyers
fought it out for the reit of the day, while
the jurors were excu-ed at Miss Fair's
expense.
The pencil deeds were formally taken
charge of by the court cierk upon Judfie
| Slack's refusal to assume the resnonsi
bility of guarding the valuable documents.
The case will go on this morning.
WITH THE LABOR UNIONS
The Painters May Be Reorgan
ized by the Paper
hangers.
Better Tims Exrected by the Ircn
molchrs and Bricktayera Tlrs
Spring
The Paper-hangers' and Decorators'
Union has under consideration a propo
sition that is eomethini; of a novelty. A
year or so ago the Painters' ami Decora
tors' Union took a >purt and by spring its
roll showed about 1200 members. As
many were decorators and prtper- hangers
it was decided to form a paper-hungers'
and decorators' union, which was dona,
the new union receiving its charter from
the Planters' Union. The new or aniza-
I tion from men to now has increased in
strength and standing,
The Painter*' Union, on the contrary,
took the down-hill course after the big
stride last summer. Three weeks ago the
body was so small and the interest so
wanting that the remainder divided what
money tnere was leu' in the treasury ami
disbanded. Now the proposition that the
Paper-hangers' Union is considering is
that of reorganizing the Painters' Union.
I the body from which il received its
I charter.
This matter was discussed at the meet
ing las evening and the sentiment was
that it would be a good move. In the
near future a reorganized Painters' Union
will probably take its place among the
lubor organizations of this City.
At the International Bricklayers' Union
meeting last evening the report was made
that business is beginning to pick up a
little, but that there are plenty of men to
nil all demands ior much more work than
appears in sight. At the next meeting a
full attendance is desired, as matters of
special importance will be reported by sev
eral committees.
A the next meeting of Carpenters' and
Joiners' Union 483, on Monday night, at
91534 Market street, two new officers will

Vice-President W. A. Carter are about to
depart ior the mining districts in British
Columbia.
At the meeting of the Ironmolders'
Union last evening at 1159 M ission street
the reports from the different shops
showed that better times and more busi
ness may De expected upon the upeni g of

PURE FOOD WINS
THE FIRST ROUND
Conviction Secured After
a Short Day in
Court.
Ev:denc2 in the Case Confined
Strictly to the Face
of Sale.
Interesting and Able Arguments ol
Counsel oa the Statutes
Involved.
The adulterated food cases attracted a
large audience in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday afternoon and evening.
The cfcÂ«e tried was that of William
Cline, 949 Market street. The trial lasted
until late in the evening and ended in
Cline's conviction. No evidence as to the
character of the ingredients in the article
complained of and sold was admitted,
neither was any testimony as to Cline's
knowledge in tne case allowed; the evi
-1
denca was confined strictly to the fact of
th* sale and that was admitted.
The Judge rendered his decision on the
demurrers filed on Thursday in the cases
of Chris Nuhrenbertr, J. Barclay Smith,
A. Quade and J. Levi. He said although
the complaints were not so carefully
drawn up as he would have liked, still ha
thou.'nt they were sufficient to Constitute
a public offense and dismissed the de
murrers.
Attorneys J. W. Dorsey, A. A. Sander
son, Wai J. Tusker and M. W. Sanderson
for the defendants look exceptions to the
Judge's rulings and asked a continu
ance till this morning to enable them to
plead, which was granted.
The defendant was chareed with sell
ing an imitation of raspberry syrup
which consisted of wnter, glucose,
cane-sogar and fuchsine as coloring. The
defendant was represented by attorneys
A. Campbell and D. J. Donavan, and As
sistant District Attorney Joseph J. Dunne
appeared as special pro-ecutor, assisted by
Prosecuting Attorney Spinetti.
A venire of fifty jurors had been sum
moned, but owing to challenges by the
prosecution and defense only te:i had boen
accepted when the venire was exhausted.
T. J. Bass, the painter, was excused be
cause he frankly stated that he would not
tnke the law in tt.o case from the Judge,
but wtuld put his own construction upon
it, raising a lau?h by saying, "I a- a juror
am the judge, and yon (meaning the
Judge) are nobody." W. R. Peterson, an
other painter, was excused on almost
similar grounds.
Seven jurorsâ A. Dockleman. J. Smith,
Joseph Rosenburg. James Ponden, M.
Sciler, A. B. Smith and W. Manning â
failed to make their appearance, and the

Another venire of ten was issued, and
the other two jarors were soon accepted.
The twelve jurors who tried the rase were:
8. A. Barr, George W. Wright. W. Jacobs,
H. Davis. Joseph Conn, E Douglas?, H.
Franzen, W. A. Coffee, W. R. Eaton,
Charles Baddock, Hugh McCormick and
j R. Lewin.
Prosecuting Attorney Spinetti opened
the case by reading the complaint and as
serting that th* allegations in the com
plaint would be proved to the satisfaction
of the jury.
Attorney Campbell moved for a dismis
sal on the ground that the complaint did
not state that raspberry syrup was an arti
cle of food or drink for" man, as required
by the statute, and on t lie ground thai the
article sold was not iood, but a drink or
drug.
Assistant District Attorney Dunne re
marked that the defendant's counsel was
covering the same ground as in the argu
ments on the demurrers, and the Judge
denied the motion.
The hrst Witness called was J. Josephs,
salesman for the defendant. Ue hau no
recollection of selling a bottle of raspberry
syrup shown him to Thomas S. Taylor,
a deuuty food inspector, and he failed to
identify Taylor. He would not swear he
did not oell it to Taylor.
Deputy Food Inspector Taylor testified
that he purchased the bottle from Jo
sephs in Cline's store on January 21, pay
ing 40 cents for it. He took it to me
Board of Health Office and then it was
sent to Professor Wenzeli for analysis.
Professor Wenzeli, analytical chemist
for the Board ol Health, testified that lie
first saw the bottle on January 21. He
made a chem>cal analysis of its contents,
which he found consisted of water, cine
sugar, glucose and furhsine or aniline
dye. Ttiere was no trace whatever of
raspberry.
"Is there anything deleterious or in
urious to heal in in cane sugar?" asked
Attorney Campbell.
Dunne objected and a long argument
followed. He contended that the ques
tion of whether the article was or was not
injurious to health did not figure in the
case at all. That question arose under
the "mixing" clause of the act, but here
the defendant was charged with selling
lor raspberry syrup what was not rasp
berry syrup, which was a statutory adul
teration. He must do business in the
truth and sell raspberry syrup.
Campbell replied, alleging that the de
fendant was not charged with selling an
imitation, but a so-called compound of
raspberry syrup.
The Judge sustained the objection.
Professor Wenzeli, in further cross-ex
amination, said tuere was nothing known
in chemical science as compound rasp
berry syrup. The analysis showed 26 1-5
water and 73 4-5 solids. It contained no
acid which raspberry syrup should con
tain. Glucose was to be found in the juice
of fruits and in honey.
''Did you find anything deleterious in
the sample?"
Objected to and objection sustained.
Witness said tie knew raspberry syrup
v.hen he saw it. The contents of the bot
tle analyzed was not raspberry syrup. He
i. ad made raspberry syrup but had never
analyzed it.
The prosecution rested and Attorney
Campbell renewed his motion for a dis
missal, which was denied.
Tbt> defendant testified that he did not
sell the bottle in evidence, but he sold the
article in his store. He did not manufac
ture it, but purchased it from the manu
facturers.
Campbell offered as evidence a bill from
the manufacturers of the article, with tho
object of showing that defendant had no
knowledge of the ingredients, but sold the
article in good faith.
Dunne objected, and said the turning
point in the case had now been reached.
Knowledge on the part of the defendant
or lacK ot knowledge was of no account.
The defendant was bound at his peril to
know the nature of the articles he sold.
He quoted numerous authorities in sup
port of his contention, and instanced de
cisions on the tame point in other crimes
and offenses.
Campbell contended that according to
the Penal Code every crime must be a
union and joint operation of act and in
tenr, and he defied the Assistant District
Attorney to find, any decision in the Cali
fornia courts to sustain his argument.
The defendant had not and could not com
mit a crime. If the law intended to reach
any one, it was the manufacturers and
not the retailers.
The Judge said, in view of the decisions
enumerated by Assistant District Attorney
Dunne, he would sustain the objection.
After tho argument of counsel, the
Judge instructed the jury in tne law bear
ing on tho case and as to their duties.
Tlie jury retired al 9:40 p. m. and at 10:30
returned for instructions.-' They asked if
the bill from the manufacturers to tbe
defendant wus in evidence, and the Judge
said it bad been ruled out. It was stated
that eleven were for cony:c;ion. They
again retired, and in ten minutes returned
intimating they had failed to agree upon
a verdict.
"One man is a candy mnn," said Jnror
JlcCormicK to the Judge, "and he won't
a^r?e upon any consideration."
"I am sure tna juror will not allow his
personal interests to interfere with his
duty," said the Judge, "so you had better
retire anain."
Eleven of the jurors demurred, bat the
Judge insisted and hinted he might be
forced to lock them up for the night.
The jury returned at 11:15 o'clock and
the foreman, W. H. Coffee, announced
they had agreed upon a verdict of guilty
with a recommendation to the leniency of
ihe court. The jury thanked the Judge
for holding a nignt session.
The Judge will sentence the defendant
this morning.

Paine's celery compound.
It i 3 foolish to take poor health "philo-
sophically" these spring days. There is
j no reason why any one should sit hands
in lap and submit to headaches, poor ap-
petite, continual tired feeling or constipa-
| tion. If every disheartened invalid will
ro right at getting well by using Pane's
I celery compound that person will be as-
tonished and delighted with the quick-
ness with which this wonderful remedy is
able to call a halt to wasting diseases, dis-
eases of debility and a "run-down" con-
dition.
Paine's celery compound doss wonders
in making people well.
Here is what a woman, an ambitious
J and hard-working member of the legal
I profession in New York City, says of this
i great remedy:
220 Fourth avenue. New York.
While a student in the New York Uni-
versity law school, and under great pres-
sure fiom worfc and stud}', I was advised
to take Paine's celery compound. I did
so, and its beneficial resivits to one whoso
nerves are under the trial of severe mental
effort I am only too ready to assert After
! latins three bottles I found that it pro-
j duced quietness of nerves and induced
I sleep, very beneficial to my health. For
those troubled with insomnia I can heart-
ily recommend it as a harmle-s inducer of
sleep on account of its quieting effect on
the nerve 3. Yours very truly,
(Signed) Florence H. Dangerfield,
Attorney and Counselor at Law.
Paine's celery compound, which makes
the weak 3trong, has received testimonials
from thousands of people who had almost
despa-.red of ever again being in perfect
health.

It Killed Stonewall Jacksob.
The bullet which it was claimed was the
direct cause of Stonewall Jacfcson's death
is now in possession of I. B. Wheeler of
Highland Falls, N. Y. Wheeler has doc
uments which clearly prove the authen
ticity of bis claim.
W r heeler's cousin was on Jackson's staff.
Early on the morning of May 1, 1863,
Jackson's division, in nccordance with the
decision of a coitncil of war, moved
toward Chancellorsirille. Lee had yielded
to Jackson's advice to flanu the
Union forces. The stratagem was
a complete success, and Sickles'
column went to pieces under the terrific
onslaught of 25,000 praycoats. It was
while reconnoitering in the darkness that
evening that Jackson's own men, mistak
ine their leader and his staff for Union
cavalry, poured a shower of bullets into
their midst, and, although several pierced
the intrepid leader, it was the one in Mr.
Wheeler's possession that made tbe fatal
wound.
The surceon who amputated Jackson's
erm threw the bullet against the wall in a
violent fit of anrer, and Wheeler's cousin
picked it up and carried it through the
war. The former Confederate died long
after the war, and Wheeler, while going
through his effects yesterday, lound the
bullet ana its history.â New York Herald.
The Ist of January has not always been
the first day of the year. For 700 years

GROWING GREATER
Big Blocks Now Being
Erected in All Parts
of the City.
Labor and Lumb:r Being Cheap
Investors Grasp Their
Opportunity.
Many Church Properties Are Mad.-
Valuable by the Surrounding
Improvements
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 15. f
There is more builaing being done in
this city at the present time than has been
in progress for years. Sevral contracts
have been recently let, and on many lots
that have always been vacant large build
ings are in course of erection.
This life in the building trade is notice
able all over the oi y, but more so in ihe
neighborhood of Clay street and Eleventh
and Fourteenth streets.
At Clay and Twelfth streets the large
AbrahamÂ«on block is nearly completed.
It is built of brick and iron and is four
atoties tiph, with a laree frontage on two
street-. On Eieventn. street the building
vr:iich will be occupied by the Acme Club
is also far advanced. On Fourteenth
street, right opposite the Macdonougu
Theater, Dr. Woolsey is erecting a nand
sonie block, in the construction of wlsich
marble will b? largely used.
St. John's Episcopal Church is now Dre
paring plans for the erection of its build
ing on a lot which it l:as recently pur
chased near the center ot town. The
first Christian Church, which vacated its
o!d building yesterday, is also pieparing
io erect a suitable house of worsnip. The
Twentieth-- treet Free Bapiist Cuurch has
a r moÃt sufficient, funds raised to build a
handsome edifice, and the spiritualists
have recently organized for the purpose
of erecting a tempie of spiritualism.
Quite recently Giei's riall has been
completed, which is a comp etc remodel
ing of the old Galvin carriage factory on
>'our;eenÂ»h street. In the neighborhood
trf Washington street, toward C:ay, Mrs.
Blake completed some time ago a lar^e
brick block, while on the same street
Loring Hall is also a new block.
Very gradually the line of new build
ings is working out toward r'ourteentn
and Grove streets. When the gas com
pany built its terra cotta block at Thir
teenth and Clay lour years ago business
people laughed at the location. Very
gradually large tlocks and stores are b>
ing built, winch reach now almost to the
gas office. In tbai neighborhood tnere
are several large pro: erties, each consist
ing of a whole block and occupied by but
one solitary dwelling or iodging-house,
all of which is on the market, and if not
disposed of soon will be cut ud into lots.
The First Congregational Church made a
deal some time ago by which a larg<> slice
of its property <vas sold to a good aavan
tage, and it is only a auesuon of time
when they will be forced to sell their large
property and move to a quieter locality.
Mr?. Biake's seminary and buildings aj
jtvning ie *rÂ« now on ianu whicn is far
more valuable for business purposes, and
as all the buildings are old there is no
doubt they will soon give way to more sub
stantial blocks.
At the present time labor is remarkably
low and lumber is very cheap, conse
quently houÂ»es are being Duilt all around
itie outskirts ot the city, and everybody
who has any ready money to invest is
putting it into income-paying property.
LIGHTS FOR THE MOLE
r Â»â â --. ;
Alameda Has a Contract With
the Southern Pacific
Company.
The â¢ Narrcw-Gause D.pot Will Be
in Darkness Nj
Linger.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 15.â The
Board of Trustees to-night authorized the
City Attorney to draw up a contract with
the Southern Pacific Company to furnish
electric light for the depot at the narrow
â  gauge mole.
â¢. The contract price is to be $75 per
month, which is to include seventy-five
lights for the outside and sixteen iighrs
for ti e inside of the offices. The railroad
company will supply the material to ex
tend the city line down the mole, and the
city's force will put up the wires. The
contract is to hold good for one year.
G. A. Bordwell presented to tne board a
petition signed by 500 electors asking that
ihe question of saloon-closing in precincts
be placed on the official ballot, to be voted
for at the election next month. Accord
ing to the referendum ordinance the num
ber of signatures required is cnly 10 per
cent of the legal voters, which number
would bÂ« about 320. Mr. Bordwell stated
that tn<) Anti-Saloon League had many
more signatures to petitions and it re
served the right to present them here
after.
Chairman Ford e re r declared that under
the terms of the ordinance the board is
not called upon to take any action. The
Cry Clerk would tile the petition and
treat the petitioned matter as provided
for in the ordinance.
M. P. Wiggin, counsel for the liquor
dealers, made an argument against the
referendum, uging that it is in conflict
with the State law regarding constitu
tional amendments, which recognizes sub
mission of questions of public interest to
.the people at large and not in political
subdivisions. Other objections under the
State law regarding bailois and the mat
ter thereon were urped, and the general
stand was maintained that there is no
legal provision to submit any question to
a vote of a municipality, except the mat
ter of the issue of bonds for a public Im
provement. ' ' ~\ : - ;â ;â :
City Attorney Taylor gave the opinion
that "tne State law expressly provides lor
the submission of questions of public mo
ment.
Trustee Hammond, speaking for the
liquor-dealers, declared that they are
quite willing to submit the question to
the people at large. He was certain that
no precinct referendum would stand hve
minutes in a court. -
A Church Anniversary.
- ALAMEDA, Cal., March 15.âT0-mor
row will be the eighteen anniversary of
'the organization of the Congregational
church of Alameda. In a hay loft on

BOUND ANYWHERE
BUT TO CARSON
Many Oaklanders Will
Leave Town Till Thurs
day Noon
Very Few Going to Nevada, but
All Will See the
Fight
Charley Hautalen'j Special Train Is
Causing a Good Deal of
At xiety.
Oakland Offick Fan Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, March 15. )
Carson is having a bad '-ffect on Oak
land. To a coriain extent it is as demoral
izing to the business and professional ele
ments as a political campaign.
All of to-dtty men who have made up
their minds to see the great exhibition
next Wednesday have been formulating
P?ans. making excuses and conceiving
devices by which their out-of-town busi
ness can be made to demand their atten
tion till Thursday noon.
Thursday noon has a peculiar signifi
cance. About thai hour a special train
wiil arrive in Oakland from Carson and
will bring back many of the select parties
that are not particularly anxious to have
it known that they are patrons of a prize
fight.
To-morrow afternoon, at 4 o'clock, Char
ley Mauialen, ex-chairman oftl.e Republi
can County Central Committee, will chap
erone a very select party to the wintry city
in Nevada. He has chartered a special
train, and one of the obligations he has
! undertaken is to guarantee that a list of
I its passengers shall not be made public.
For this reason a very clever device has
been adopted. In the rear of Mautnlen's
special will be a lonely coach, wliose des
tination will be some point between Port
Costa and Sacramento. Everybody going
j on the train who has any scruples at all
regarding his excursion will, of course,
j merely be taking a trip to Dixon or some
I other unimportant point.
Lliifortunateiy the train could not be
held back until after dark, or it wouid noi
arrive in time to witness tne right. It
must leave in broad daylight, and the
number of Oaklanders who will go Sncra-
I mentoward in that tail coach will no
! doubt be very surprising, considering
bow close is the adjournment of the Lsgis
laiure.
While it ia not likely that the shrewd
men of Oakland will resort to the old
"burying his grandmother" ruse, many
sudden notices of business requiring their
presence at Ukiah or Santa Cruz or same
intermed.ate point have been received,
and on more than one office door can be
seen the story, ''Out of town ; will be back
Thursday noon." Quito a few have al
reaay packed their satchels and labeled
them to any point north or soutii, but have
been very careful that there shall not be a
suggestion of "easterly," while in their
pocketbooks could be found pasteboards
containing in capital letters the words,
''Special to Carson."
In probably no other city in the Union
would such tactics be necessary, but Oak
land is different from every otner city,
and it would blast her reputation for two
decades should it become known that
there werÂ«i enough lovers of prize-lighting
within her sacred borders to till a rpecial
train.
This on top of the defeat of the saloon
closing proposition would be altogether
too much even for Oakland.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â There will

davits ana depositions to be taken.
McELROY IS ANGRY.

.ml Nuvy Lengue.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â Colonel
J. P. McElrov, who waa expelled rr< m the
Army and Navy Republican League, is a
very angry man. His expulsion was due
to the fact that he violated a sworn obli
gation by deserting the camp and going
to \he standard of A. C. Henry in the re
cent municipal campaign.
The colonel said he intends to take the
matter into court and sue the Jeacue for
damages. He says lv should have been
tried by court-martial aa becomes a sol
dier, instead of being expelled without a
hearing. The officers of the league ridi
cule the colonel's position and assert
that, having taken the oath to support
the Republican ticket, he was bound to
support it, and not turn trai or to a man
wno was only put up for office for the
purpose of pulling enough votes from
Captain Thomas to elect Mayor Davie.

V Â«eh I'aaless Eipeime.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â John
Stewan objected to having a case tried in
Judge Cliffs court and decided to have it
tried in Livermore. The nniount involve i
is $10. The railroad fare for round trip
from Oakland to Liverniore is $3. Six
people will have to pay this fare because
of the change of venue. The suit was
Drought by John Stewart against Mrs. F.
Miller, and when Judge Clift was asked
why it was not transferred to Judge Allen's
court across the street he explained:
"Stewart objected to having the case go to
Judge Allen and he also objected to hav
ing it Bent to East Oakland or Alomeda.
Therefore there was no alternative but to
send it somewhere else, and I transferred
it to Livermore because Justice Taylor has
transferred several cases to my court."
CANDIDATES SPJNT LITTLE.
Their "Friends, " However, Must Have
Been of the Very Beat Brand.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â Although
there was plenty of money spent in the
last campaign it must have been by the
friends of the candidates, for those who
sought the people's support are filinc the
lowest statements of election expenses that
were ever seen. H. D. Talcott, including
an assessment by the Republican City
Central Committee, spent $47 25. A. Fibujh
was elected a Councilman on $46, while
Mark A. ThoniMs was elected a School Di
rector on $19 60. Considering th- enor
mous amount of illustrated literature and
cards that were distributed printing must
have been very cheap, or else candidates
must have kept very faulty books. : ',;â  _

A FLY WAS ON
THE DEPOSITION
Official Court Reporters Baf
fled by an Unruly
Graphophone.
Sounds Attribute to the D.
poneat That H3 Never
U t?red.
An Expert F.rul y Found That an
Insect Hat Caused All the
Excitement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 15. J
The use of the graphophone is becoming
common with the official reporters of the
Alameda Superior courts. It is a very
delicate instrument, and not only records
tee words the reporter s anxious that it
should, but just as faithfully retain* all
other no s -s, aad herein lies the secret of
an investigation that has just been con
cluded.
While talking into bis machine the re
porter, if he cannot n;ake out his hen
tracks with ease, will sometimes comment
on the diiiiculty, and for some time this
somewhat bothered tue lady typewriters
whan transcribing from the delicate wax
cylinders, but they have now become used
to it.
Saturday, however, a d fficulty arose
that puzz ed all the official stenographers
and typewriters in the City. A very im
portant deposition had been taken by
Eugene Van Court, ihe Police Court
stenographer and well-known athlete.
Eugene sat down at the grapboplione and
faithfully read off his notes, which were
just as failhiuily recorded on the cylin
der. He turned over tho cylinders to
Miss Anna Fogurly, one of the speediest
typewriters in the coui:ty, and, with the
repeating machine screwed firmly to her
bead, .the touched the button and the
wheeis commenced to revolve.
The machine diin't ta.n. It quarreled
and buzzed and snarled, and M:ss Fojrarty
was alarmed. She hud never heard of
such a deposition, and saia that she never
wanted the privilege of transcribing any
such thing. Thinking, perhaps, tuac tin*
gnipbophone was out of order, the cylin
der wa- put on another machine, but it
only made matters worse. It actually
swore.
Stenographer Van Court was sent for,
and when he Heard his deposition he
vowed that he had never used such lan
guage, but there was his mark on the
cylinder and he could not disown it.
Then the assistance of Frank Thwaites,
the official s enographer of tho District
Attorney's office, was invoked. Mr.
Thwaitesis an expert on graphophones,
ami he gave the cylinder a trial. He
1 stened eagerly for a few moments and
then said very decidedly, -'No deponent
saveth what 1 hear and never did."
The incident created great interest
among the little army of reporters and
stenographers, and as nothing could be
done an expert from the agency was
called in.
The machine was carefully inspected
and the great secret was revealed. All the
official repertonal talent ot a county had
bten outwitted Dy a lively buzzfly. The
little insect had crept itito the tv c and
had buzzed and crawled all the time Van
Court was rolling off that deposition and
all the vibrations of the busy winga had
been recorded as well as the heavier vibra
tions of the athlete's voice.
Van Court has talked that deposition
over atam and now he makes his boast
that having carefully inspected the tube
beforehand there will be no flies on the
testimony. ___________
HATED TO BE "JOSHED."
Blue and Go d Editors Confronted
by a Student Bsnt on
Revenge.
Spoils a Form of Type to Prevent a
Jibs Frcm Being Pub
lished
BERKELEY, Cal., March 15.âFore
bodings of lively times to come lor the
editor of '.98'? "Blue and Gold" jave al
ready made themselves apparent, though
the book is only half finished and the date
set for its appearance is one month hence.
Already Editor-in-chief G. J. Rector and
Manager L. C. Mott have found it nects
sary to use their muscle to prevent vio
lence from being committed on their per
sons by an enraged classman who was
bent on keeping n certain "josh" on him
from being printed.
It was last Saturday at the printing
office in San Francisco where the book is
being published, that the difficulty oc
curred. The young man in question,
whose identity the editor and manager
after being implored swore to keep in
violate, heard thai a joke concerning him
was to be published, and thinking that he
could most easily head it off by bluffing
the printer, went to his office and looking
over the forms of type he discovered the
lines he sought.
He made "pi" out of the standing type,
and was taken to task by the printer, ana
asked lor an explanation. Just ai this
juncture Mott and Rector appeared on
the scene, when hostilities were resumed.
A battle royal was imminent, but discre
tion finally prevailed, and the subject of
the cutting doggerel was given to under*
stand that he could not bluff the edi
tor, whereupon he offered an apology
and pleaded that hie name would
not be mentioned to the outside
world. Rector "Dig" says that the ques
tion is to appear aiong with other similar
ones and that he does not propose to be
scared into suppressing tho s] ice which
will give flavor to the class yearbook. On
the contrary he say- he in. ends to make
poo I use of bis right of speech and that
coercion by any one short of the faculty
will not work.

OAKLAND'S OPPIOIAL COUNT.
it Closed After Midnight With No
Change in the TotalÃ
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â The Coun
cil chamber presented one oi its old-time
appearunces to-night, the occasion being
the official canrass of the election of last
Monday. Although there w<.re a few
gross errors discovered, they were in re
gard to minor offices. The revelations
promised by the friends of Mayor Davie
via not develop.
The loDby waa picked, and the throne
passed the barrier and flocKel around the
tellers and clerks. All the old counci.
and nearly all ih â  new were present, and
there was also a small army of political
hangers-on, who are living between fear
and hope till the new administration takes
(.ffice and the ax begins to fall.
Counciimen Manuel and Towle who bid
farewell to the Council nexi month ana
who, therefore, have no need to save their
Voices for some of the heated debates that
are anticipated, were appointed teller* and
'â¢Old Pard" Basset;, who had dcci ed dur
ing the day noi to introduce his Sunday
closing ordinance, kept them supplied
with drinking water.
The tally progressed rapidly. For the
first time in offic:al canvasses lour patent
addiDg machines weie placed in the C >un
cil chain ber and t c semi-numan mechan
ism did good work.
In the Fourth Precinct of '.he First
Ward Davie lost liftmen and occasionally a
vote or two would fluctuate, but nothing
of interest occurred till me Second Pre
cinct of the Fittn Ward was reuc-ied. In
the envelope with the ballots there was no
tally-sheet and a ss.trch was inÂ«de for it.
Tue inspector named Sherman was sent
for, and afier iiaving testified that the
tally sheet was in another envelope it was
produced, and the count proceeded alter
all kind- of objections had Dee n offered
by Councilman Kaufman on behalf of
Mayor Davie. Tne canvass added a few
to Thomas' majority, out the vote as
already printed was altered in no material
manner.
The count closed soon after midnight
and showed no change that affected the
totals.
BASSETT BACKED DOWN.
D.d Not Carry His Threat in Re
lation to Sunday Â£a oon
Closing.
Could Not Gt Enough Votes anl Could
Not Make a Losing
Fig It.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 15. \
Councilman iJas-iett did not introduce
his Sunday-ciosing ordinance at the Coun
cil to-nighi. He had intended to take up
the measure for the purpose of getting
even \vi h that element of the saloon
keepers who defeated him at tho election.
"Since making the announcement that
I intended to introduce a Sunday-closing
ordinance," said Mr. Bassett to-day, "I
have taken a step which it would perhaps
have been wiser to have taken before. As
certaining the number of votes that would
be necessary (o suspend the rules, I find
wesuou.d be one, and possibly two, short.
"The rules cnn only be suspended by
eight votes. My motion would receive
but seven. The ordinance would then be
reierreri to its proper committee and be
con>idered in that committee of the in
coming Council, and they would most
certainly relegate it to a pigeonhole
eternity.
"My opinion is unchanged that a Sun
day-closing ordinance, while not affecting
the orderly law-abiding saioon, would
drive out of existence the disreputable
hole in the wa'.i kept by individuals who
would sell liquor to a drunken father or
his four-year-old child. As lam now ab
solutely certain that the ordinance could
not be passed to print this evening, which
is a necessity to its final passage before
the present Council goes out of office, 1
decided to withdraw it and not make a
losing fight.

Donors
RESOLUTIONS GF THANKS TO
"THE CALL."
Prominent Citizns Delivered Stirring
Addressesâ Congress Ap
pealed To.
"Cuba Libre" held full sway at Califor
nia Hall last evening, the Cuban League
being oui in full force to testity to its
sympathy with the patriots ana to receive
from the fair hands that made it the
Cuban banner emblematic of the Cuban
Republic. The Ladies' Auxiliary of the
league, consisting of Mrs. A. Bertucci,
Mr 3. M. Popper, Mrs. M. Cricamo, Mrs.
L. Froment, Mrs. J. H. Jones, Mrs. G.
Getz, MrÂ«. G. Fowler, Mrs. F. E. Mas
cherini, Mrs. L. Smith. Mi-s M. Papa,
Miss B. Luz. Mrs. J. Lambuck, M:ss F.
Luna, Miss L. Brown, Miss M. Brand, Miss
O. Cassins. Miss M. Lavare. Miss M. Mod
est, Miss G. Gratn, Miss E. Podesta, Miss
H. Cashinsand Miss L. Guinass, was pres
ent in a body, each member wearing the
Cuban colors, and presented the hand
some banner amid much enthusiasm from
ihe crowded hall.
There were also present, in addition to
the members of the league, a number of
prominent citizens, and toe speeches in
favor of free Cuba that were made were
. received with spontaneous enthusiasm.
The meeting wa< called to order by
President John H. Jones and communi
cations expressing regret 3t being unable !
to attend were read by Secretary Mas- ]
cherini. Among them were telegrams |
from A. D. Jones, Senator Feeny and J.
Bohannon of Sacramento and W. J. Jacks
of Winteis and Mayor Phelan sent a let- ;
ler of regret expressing his best wishes
for the success of the league.
President Jones called the attention of
the members to the mass-meeting that is
to be held on Saturday evening and par- I
licularly requesting that all present at- j
tend on that occasion.
Mrs. Frona E. Woite was introduced to
speak to the members on the Cuban ques
tion and spoke of the great pleasure she i
tocÂ»s in addressing so many enthusiastic i
friends of the Cubans.
"I cannot understand," she said, "why
Cuba should be under the rule of Spain, ;
nor why the United States Government i
should be so tender of the feelings of the !
Spanish. Spain recognized the Southern I
Slates forty days after the rinn<j on Fort
Sumter. They say that the Cubans are
negroes. What of it? What if they have
colored blood in their veins, are they not |
as worthy of sympathy as those who are !
white? Are they not human beings with I
the feelings and rights of men and
women ?
"It is time we helped Cuba, as we i
wanted beip while we were struggling for
freedom. If we are going to help Cuba we j
should do it now.
"Think of the indignities that Butcher !
Weyler has heaped on the women of
Cuba. He forces them to wear in their
hair the Spanish colors, yellow and red, j
instead of the reJ, white and blue that
they love so well. But they show their
spirit by putting in a knot of black to
testify so their sorrow at their country's |
fate."
Charles M. Shortridge was called on to |
speak, but gave way to the Ladies' Auxili
ary, which, represented by pretty Miss
Irene Bertucci, stepped forward and
handed the beautiful emblem to Presi
dent Jones.
The speech that accompanied the ban
ner was in well-chosen words and was
warmly applauded. On either side of her
stood Johnny and Rosie Mascherini, the
children of the secretary, each bearing an
American flag.
In accepting the banner the president
spoke as follows:
Ladies of the Cuban Auxiliary: On.behaH of
the Cuban League of San Francisco I accept
this ensign, the token of Cuba's iuture lib
ertyâthis banner constructed by ihe hands of i
those whose hearts yearn and plead lor the |
freedom of an oppressed people. As I gaze I
upon this hnndlwork I imagine how happy j
and proud and with what renewed courage !
those struggling patriots will battle when j
they know that even in the far-distant West j
there exists a band of courageous, energetic
and determined women who labor and prny
tnat the shackles of tyranny and oppression
may be torn from those whose heroic struggles
entitle them to the sympathy and assistance
of the wnole civilized world.
Whenever we shall look upon this flag it

With a Banner at California Hall Last Evening.
will recall to our minds that the noblest, the
; purest and the best instincts of mankind ex
hort us to further and greater action, and tliat
our labors can only cease when our object has
been accomplished and Cuba is a recognized,
independent nation by the entire world. I
again thank you for this emblem of your de
votion to the cause.
He then introduced Colonel C. L. Tay
lor, who said that he was heart and soul
in sympathy with the Cubans in their
struggle for liberty.
"It is in the interest of liberty the world
over," he said, "that we aid Cuba in her
great struggle. What, matter if they are
colored? They are people to ba admired;
they love freedom."
A. P. Van Dnzer was introduced, and
read a poem of his own composition for
whicn he asked the consideration of the
audience. It was filled with patriotic en
thusiasm, ana was received with much
favor.
George T. Gaden said that he spoke from
the standpoint of one who knew the state
of affairs in the Gem of the Antilles â he
had been in business there ten years, and
knew the exact state of affairs.
The Cubans, he said, *vere a brave and
deserving people, who were ground under
the iron heel of Spain. "Cuba for the
Cubans" should be the cry of all liberty
loving nations, and the Americans in par
ticular.
Charles M. Bhortridge addressed the
audience briefly, calling attenti n to the
mass-meeting of Saturday night. He was j
sure, he said, that the committee on reao- j
Unions would produce something of which
the people of San Francisco would be
proud, and that the able orators who
would speak would show the audience
that there was reason why the people of j
the United States should raise their voices
in unison in favor of Cuba Libre. He ]
spoke in glowing terms of the patriotism i
of the Ladies' Auxiliary, and said that !
San Francisco should be proud of its !
members.
Mrs. John H. Jones recited "Little Joe," j
a pathetic poem that brought tears to the j
eyes of the ladies and a storm of applause
from the male members of the audience.
Secretary Faust E. Mascherini was the j
next speaker, and he directed particular 'â 
attention to the fact that The Call was !
the only newspaper that had shown any |
interest in the Cuban movement in San |
Francisco. He spoke of the apathy of the
Examiner, which claimed to be a friend of
liberty and the Cubans, and yet let its
readers think that there were no friends of
Cuba in San Francisco by excluding from
its columns the news of the great progress
that had been made. He characterized
The Cali, as the true friend of Cuba and
liberty, and called upon his hearers to
support it to their utmost extent.
At the conclusion of his address George
T. Gaden proposed a vote of thanks to
The Call for its efforts in behalf of the
Cuban movement, and the measure was
carried unanimously.
A set of resolutions introduced by A.
Meyer, a member of the league and of the
committee on mass- meeting, appointed by
Mayor Phelan, were adopted by acclama
tion. They read as follows:
Whereas, a state of war exists in the island
of Cuba, causing the death of many human!
beings and great destruction of property and
seriously injuring American commerce and
interests; and whereas, Spain has shown its
inability to conquer the inhabitants of Cuba j
now fighting for their freedom and the over- j
throw of their cruel and unjust rulers; and
whereas, the Spanish soldiers with the
knowledge of their superiors brutally murder
peaceful citizens and destroy their property i
and also show no respect for the rights of I
American citizens in Cuba; and whereas, the
speedy recognition of the Cuban patriots by i
this Government as belligerents would soon
end the war and thereby save from death
thousands of human beings and stop the
wasteful destruction of property in Cuba,
therefore Ije it
Resolved, That we the citizens of San Fran
cisco and members of the Cuban League of I
this City here by request our Representatives
and Senators to use their earnest efforts to
have the Cubans, now manful iy striving for
freedom, recognized by the Government of the
United States of America as belligerents, and
also use their influence to have this Govern
ment protect its citizens now in Cuba; and be
it further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
sent to our Representatives ana Senators in j
Washington, h. C, and to the press of this
City.
The meeting closed with three rousing
cheers for Cuba Libre that made the build
ing ring. __________^^___

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1897.
RAILWAY MAIL MEN
OUT FOR A "TIME"
A Big Trainload From the
East Drop Down in
This City.
Annual Convention of the Mu
tual Benefit Associa
tion.
Will Be Here for Five Days Doing
Business and Seeing the
Sights.
There rolled down the Oakland mole
yesterday afternoon a special train that
had carried a merry party across the con
tinent. The eight Pullmans of which it
was chiefly composed emptied themselves
and shortly thereafter this same merry
party was scrambling for streetcars at the
ferry in this City seeking their respective
hotels under the pilotage of a committee
of railway mail service men. For the
merry party was composed of delegates to
the convention of the Railway Mail Ser
vice Mutual Benefit Association, which
convenes in this City to-day. The con
vention will be held at the Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium, to be called to order at 10
o'clock this morning.
This is the twenty-second annual con
vention of the association and its first
visit in this nearly a quarter of a century
of its existence to the Pacific Coast. This
is not to say that it did not want to come
earlier, but not until now have the
obstacles to the "long haul" been over
come. In 1893 they came as far out as
Denver, and thought they were doing
well. At tiie convention last year a strong
puil and a pull all together succeeded in
landing the gathering for this year over
the Rockies. Arrangements have been
made for a big lime and every man and
woman of the party is bent upon making
the most of it, for the party does not con
sist of delegates alone. They have
brought their wives and other lady
relatives along, and the party numbers
about 300. The headquarters is at the
Baldwin Hotel, where the officers and
their contingents are housed.
The Railway Mail Service Mutual Bene
fit Association is an insurance organiza
tion, including in its membership railway
postal clerks of the United States, post
office inspectors and department officials,
who supervise the transportation of mails.
It was organized twenty-seven yeais aeo
and now embraces a membership of 3760,
every one of whom is insured for $2000. It
has had its ui'S and downs, but is now
tending uninterruptedly upward. A treas
urer who in the loose metnods of the
earlier stages had given no security and
ran away with all the funds gave it its
principal downward tumble, but the finan
ciering has fallen into better habits, and
the association is one of the soundest of
the kind in the country. It was started
with the purpose of overcoming the exces
sive premiums of insurance required by
the oid companies of these men in their
extrahazardous calling. The organization
has but one salaried officer, and he re
ceives the pay of his grade in the mail
service. By keeping the expenses at a
minimum in this way the association has
effected a system of insurance the cheap
est in the world.
The annual gathering is not a strictly
business affair, but, as has been indicated,
a large measure of amusement is allowed
to diversify its programme. The Post
office Department gives encouragement to
tliH by furnishing transportation, and
Ihe convention has come to be an annual
outing to which the delegates look for
ward I'rom year to year.
The transcontinental train was made up
at Chicago, the delegates from east of the
Missouri gathering there on thp 9th inst.
Conducted by Superintendent L. L. Tracy
of the sixth division, they loft there Tues
day afternoon last and ran to Portland.
At Spokane Superintendent Flint of the
eighth division took charge of the train.
They spent a day in and about Portland,
and left Saturday evening. They arrived
at Sacramento yesterday morning, and
were received and addressed by Governor
Bucid in the Assembly chamber.
Mayor Phelan will deliver an address of
welcome at the opening of the business
su-Bion this morning. President P. P.
I Waring will respond, Superintendent
F int and others will also make addresses.
Another session will be held in the after
noon and in the evening a promenude
concert will be <:iven in honor of the
guests at the Emporium.
On Wednesday a bay excursion 5s ar
ranged and in the evening a theater party
at the Tivoli, "Tne Merry Wives of Wind
sor" being the attraction.
Thursday will be devoted to business
again. On Friday a run will be taken to
Santa Cruz and the big trees. Saturday
morning will be the final business session
and in the afternoon a ride to the Cliff is
scheduled. In the evening a reception,
with lunch, will be held at the Baldwin.
During the stay the ladies of the party
will be looked after by a committee of
ladies and will be shown about and enter
tained, while the men are holding their
business sessions.
The party will leave for Los Angeles
Sunday morning.
Following are the committees having
charge of arrangements here:
Transportationâ fcamuel Flint, R. R. Munro,
W. C. Hammond.

AUSTRALIANS COMING.
Arrangements About Complete for the
Approaching; Visit of the Anti
podal Baseball Team.
The final arrangements have been about
completed for the coming visit of an Aus
tralian baseball team. Manager Harry
Musurave is now in this City and stopping
at the Baldwin Hotel. The Australian
mails, which arrived here Saturday,
brought further information regarding
the proposed trip.
The Australian baseball team is made
up of the very fastest players to be had in
all Australia. In order to secure the best
available talent a committee of three was
appointed to select the touring team. As
a result of their work the following play
ers have been chosen to represent the land
of the kangaroos: William Ellis, W. Ingle
ton, C. Kemp, P. Layer, P. McAllister, R.
Eruers, H. Irwin, C. Over, S. W. Smith,
H. Stuckev, J. Wallace, A. E. Wiseman
and J. McKee.
A. G. Spalding's famous globe-trotting
expedition with two 01 the fastest base
ball teams that ever swung the willow
marked the initiation of the great Ameri
can game into the Australian colonies.
That was eigtit years ago. Since Spald
ing's departure the sport lias taken a
strong hold on the Australians, and it has
been dividing Its popularity with cricket
ever since.
As a result the Anstralians became very
enthusiastic over the game and decided to
send a club to this country to compete
against our star aggregations.
Harry Musgrave, the manager of the
baseball team, was here last summer as
manager of the Australian Cricket Eleven.
The very reason that he was selected to
conduct this baseball enterprise is due to
the tact tnat the cricket affair was so suc
cessful.
Mr. Musgrave is well known to the
theatrical profession. He is a member of
tue firm of Williamson <feMusgrave, lessees
and managers of the Princess, the leading
theater in Australia. Mr. Musgrave organ
ized a fair for the benefit ot the Actors'
Fund, and as a result of bis good work he
netted the fund over $8000.
AVALANCHE OF SOOT.
Malicious Mischief on the Part of a
Workman on the Hoof of the
City Hall.
One of the workmen employed in lay
ins a cement roof on the City Hall amused
himself yesterday afternoon by throwing
chunks of mortar down the chimneys on
the Larkin-street wing of the builJing
The result was that tons of soot were
dislodged and descended into the rooms
on the different floors. Chief Crowley
was talking to Commissioner Gunst and
another gentleman in bis office when the
soot poured imothe room, covering the
Chief from head to feet and the greater
portion of the carpet and furniture. Com
missioner Gunst and the other gentleman
escaped by rushing out of the room.
Captain Lees happened to be out of his
office and escaped the avalanche of soot.
His carpet was covered with several
inches of the soot, and it took one of the
janitors nearly all the afternoon to
straighten out things in the Chief's and
captain's offices. The rooms in the base
ment did not escape.
Sent to Jail.
John Burns and Frank Howard, two ex
convicts who were arrested last week on
Gough street while acting suspiciously, were
each sent to the County Jail yesterday by
Judge Campbell for having burglars' tools in
their possession. Burns got an additional six
months for vagrancy.
STRATTON
IN TOWN
The Famous Owner of the
Independence Here to
See the Mines.
HE MAT MAKE LARGE
INVESTMENTS.
Is Pleased With Discoveries
Near Yuma and Will

HE WILL ALSO j XAMINE THE
MOTHER LCD*.
His Story of the Work oa His Great
Properties and the Progress
cf Cripple Creek
W. S. Stratton, owner and discoverer
of the famous Independence mine at
Cripple Creek, and the largest owner in
the Portland mine in the same camp and
also widely known for iis richness, arrived
here yesterday and is at the Palace. He
is accompanied by Augustus House of
Colorado Springs. Mr. Stratton is by far
the most conspicuous of ail the bonanza
kings of the Western States who have
arisen during the pa-u few years.
His wealth ii variously estimated at
from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000. Only four
or live year- ago he was a carpenter in
Colorado Springs. Times being hard, and
unabe to get work at nis trade, he set out
prospecting. He wandered a few miles
away in the mountains to the west, and
there struck the ledge of the Independ
ence, a name celebrated now throughout
the globe. Then arose Cripple Creek, one
of the most fascinating and entirely
unique cold camps of the world.
The man who has accumulated the
wealth of a Crossus in so short a time yet
bears all the marks of the prospector.
Last night at the palace he wore an old
drab-colored hat, with a liberal breadth of
brim, and his garb throughout was that of
a plsin and unpretentious man' of the
west.
He is of medium size, has grayish eyes
and a mustcebe almost snow white, while
his hair is iron gray.
"I never was in California before, ex
cepting fora few days two yours ago," said
Mr. Stratton. "I wasn't here long enough
to fiml out much about the mineral re
sources. This time I want to stay longer.
I have come partly lor bus ness and partly
for pleasure. I have been struck with the
evidences of mineral richness in Southern
California, not at Randsbunr, for I have
not been there, but in the vicinity of Yu
ma and about seventy-five miles from
â¢ here, where the recent strike was made.
From what I could learn from inquiry of
different persons, I came to the conclu
sion the country wag pretty rich. The
mountains about there look much as
they do in the San Juan country.
'â¢It is my intention to co back there,
for I want io find out more about it. I
may also visit some of the mines of the
mother lode in the foothills of the Sierras,
but as to this I can tell better later.
"No, in my judgment that great tunnel
under Pikes Peak will never be built. It
is ail nonsense talirmg about it. Why. it
would take twenty years to complete
it, and then the mines of Cripple Creek
would be all played out. And they don't
know whether they would get any min
eral under the peak anyway or not.
They might just as well go out and run a
tunnel into these coast mountains any
where.
"The mines of Cripple Creek are show
ing up now better than ever, but the town
itself is slower. There are too many peo
ple there or have been. 1 suppose that
there are not less than 40.000 now scat
tered around in the district. The
town is like most all of the towns west of
Ohio â overdone. It is the same way in
Denver, and the same way on this coast.
"I am only working about seventy-hve
men now on the Independence, but I
have a great many powerful drills and
other machinery which has taken the
place of many men. The work I am doing
is largely development. The Portland is
working a good force. lam interested in
three very larga groups of mines besides
these. One is the Gold Crater, and in each
group there are some thirty or forty acres
or more. The development on these is
going forward steadily.
"It seems to me from what I see that
California miners do not push things as
much as we do. If we had in Colurado
the big veins and rich ore that I con
stantly hear about here we would do a
great deal more with them. It seems so
to me, at least.
"I know your Mr. Lane here who is
manager of the Utica. He iÂ« a big broad
gauge man. I met him in Denver during
the last campaign.
"It was in that campaign that I offered
to wager $100,000. Some pÂ»ople in New
York were putting up s3oo, ooo against; it, or
wired me that they would, and wanted to
place $300,000 more. They never came to I
the front on either wager, however, and
convinced one by this act that they were
only bluffing."
Mr. Stratton and his associate will
probably be here several days before set
ting out to see the mines.
