j (By the Court.)
The Senate of the State was engaged in an investigation of the
conduct of its members under a published charge that some of them,
whose names were not given, had taken bribes for aiding in the
passage of a certain bill. The news editor and one of the reporters of
the- paper which published this charge were called upon to testify in
the matter and refused to answer certain interrogatories propounded to
them, upon the ground that the information sought to be elicited was
privileged and the evidence, if given, would be irrelevant and hearsay.
The question, in brief, contained a demand that the witnesses should
give the names of those from whom they had received information
touching the charge of bribery and the substance of that information.
The inquisitorial investigation upon which the Senate was engaged was
one strictly within its jurisdiction to prosecute. It had the undoubted
power to examine into the alleged criminal conduct of some of its mem
bers, with- a view to their expulsion or other punishment if found
guilty. (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal., 395.) Under such an investiga
tion these witnesses who were shown to have been responsible for the
public charge, and who at the same time disclaimed personal knowl
edge of the facts, were asked to give the names of their informants. It
was a natural and logical method for the Senate to follow in its
endeavor to arrive at the truth. If the witnesses first answering that
they had no personal knowledge of the matter were to be justified in
refusing to give the names of their informants, the Senatorial inquiry
must necessarily come to an end. Upon the other hand, if they stated
the names of their informants and the nature of their information the
Senate could summon those persons and so trace the charge to a just
conclusion. The evidence, then, was relevant and pertinent. The
case differs from those presented in court where the interests lie
between conflicting parties, and where improper evidence sought to be
introduced in the interest of one must be to the injury of the other.
Here the inquiry was inquisitorial to arrive at the truth concerning the
charge of corruption, silent as to names, indefinite as to facts, but
sftrcific in its assertion of bribery. There were no parties to this
proceeding. The Senate was investigating the conduct of its own
members, and it was a contempt of its authority for the witnesses to
refuse to give the names of those who were responsible for the pro
mulgation of the charge. It cannot be successfully contended, and
has not been seriously argued, that the witnesses were justified in
refusing to give these names upon the ground that the communication
was privileged.
. The writ is discharged and the prisoners remanded to the Sheriff
of Sacramento County.
"The writ is diÃcnarced and the prison
ers remanded to the Sheriff of Sacramento
Count y."
Short but decisive these few words of
the Supreme Court, and to the Examiner
fakers came almost as the knell of I
doom. Back to the grimy dungeon now
goJ-ons Green Andy Lawrence and his
unfortunate lieutenant, L. L. Levings, in
justification of the fact that mua-siinging
and charges of corruption without eround
are not altogether profitable occupations,
to far as the honorable Senate of the State
of California is concerned, at least.
Â£tep by s;ep the procedure mapped out j
by Senator Morehouse, who has been the
foremost of the Senate champions, has
Lcen successfully followed, aud in every !
pnise of the case the honor of the legisia- j
'to s has been vindicated. Senator AiÂ«ore- I
â¢use's position lias been strengthened, j
and the Examiner has been driven farther i
and farther into the maze of falsehood and j
equivocation witb which it has surrounded

ter of every honest man who dared resent
the imputation against his integrity,
the Long Green editor and his paper
have been convicted of what they
dared not admitâ that his charges of
bribery emanated from himself; they
were the natural offspring of a mind bent
in tin- direction they indicate.
Through it ail Senator H. V. MorehouÂ«e
has been the leader of ihoso who dared
drag into the lieht. a paper more u<sd to
do its work in the dark. He has de
manded all along that the charges having
been made by the Examiner must be
proved by the Examiner, ana failine to
prove them that they be admitted to be
false. His answer was a shower of mud.
He it was who saw the investigation
properly proceeded with, and wr.o headed
off the wiles and tricks of the unscrupu
lous parent of the charges. He it was
who followed tue case fo the Sacramento
courts and to the Supreme Court, and
whether before court or committee he has
been able to pierce the cloud of malice
and venom and personality with which,
after the manner of the devil-fish, the Ex
aminer concealed itself, and keep the
squirming faker for once in its life to a
straight lino of fact and expression.
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MARCH 17, 1897.
The Justices of the Supreme Court, Six of Whom Heard and Denied the Writ of Habeas Corpus Secured by Andrew Lawrence,
The decision of the court was rendered
at a late hour, after a session lasting iroru
10 o'clock in the morning. Argument on
the part of counsel took up most of the
day, and it was only a few hours nfter
ward that the decision remanding the ed
itor in contempt and his unfortunate lieu
tenant back to prison was rendered.
The Supreme Court sitting in bank heard
argument in the matter of the habeas cor
pus procee iines instituted by tlie attorneys
acting for the managing editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, A. M. Lawrence,
otherwise known to fame as "Loner
Green," and L. L. Levinjjs, one of the Ex
aminer's Sacramento correspondents, both
of whom were recently committed to jtil
by the Senate for contempt, on t eir re
fusal to answer certain questions pro

and Falsehood. . ....
pounded by the Senate itself, as well as
by the committee appointed to consider
the charge of bribery, preferred against
tho former by Mr. Hearse's -ocal exponent
of gutter journalism.
Judge Hughes of Sacramento, it will be
remembered, originally issued the writ of
habeas corpus, but declined to reverse the
decision of the Senate, declaring in effect
that that body had authority to act in the
manner staiea. The attorneys for the de
fendants th n applied to the Supreme
Court for another writ, which was granted
and made returnable yesterday mornim?,
the defendants being admitted to bail in
the meantime.
The six Supreme Court Justices who
card argument yesterday were Chief Jus
tice Beaity and Justices McFarlane, Har
! rison, Garoutte, Van Fleet, Henshaw and
Temple.
G. W. McEnerney conducted the argu
ment on behalf of the pntitioners, associ
ated with him being C. F. Heggerty, A. J.
Glunie and Georee A. Knictiit. The At
torney-General, William F. Fiizgerald,
and his deputy, W. H. Anderson, repre
sented the Senate, while tae public-spirited
and indefatigable member of that body
from Santa Clara County, LL.Y. Morehouse,
was also on hand to prompt and advise as
the circumstances suggested.
The argument had well begun before the
unhappy "Long Green" could summon up
sufficient courace to enier the courtroom.
Then he stole in noiselessiy "lest men
should say look where three farthings
goes," as the poet has it, and with bated
breath soueht the sheltering protection
of his attorney. â¢
. Tne small audience present was com
posed: to a grÂ»>at extent of newspaper men,
who mturally leel a professional interest
in the proceed ings; â .- ' â 
Attorney McEnerney opened the argu
ment shortly - after 10 -o'clock and con
tinued lor upward of an hour. Â»
He 'contended that the limit of the
Senate's â¢ authority was, with respect to
matters or this kind,, an investigation'
of the s truth or falsity of the charge
of v bribery, and ' that it was no " part I
of its duty or power to set on foot an in
quiry as to wuether or not its members
had been slandered. - la the latter case
the proper recourse was to the ordinary
courts by means of civil and criminal ac
tions.â¢"" ' â¢" - -- â¢
i , He took the position further, with refer
ence to ? the resolution, i that it coupled
matters over wnicii the Senate ' had â¢no
jurisdiction with other matters over which t
it had jurisdiction, and that these two
classes of inquiry .being' so interwoven â 
and dependent the whole i matter fell, in
| asmuch as it was impossible to determine
whether * the "questions propounded were
referable \ to 1 the portion within the Sen
ate's jurisdiction or to the o4hÂ«r. ' ;
: Attorney-General ..Fitzgerald, V havins;
taken exception to McEnerney's interpre
tation of the facts," which he in his turn
recited for the better enlightenment of the
court, quoting the questions t , and the
answers which resulted in the committal
of \ the r . petitioners, proceeded to, define
the functions of a writ (of â  habeas corpus,
which tie held to be one of the first ques
tions presenting itself. He said: "Now,
where the petitioner is held in custody by
an officer under a warrant of commitment,
the functions of the writ of habeas corpus
are limited always > simply to ;an â¢' inquiry
with reference to the jurisdiction of the
court, or the body issuing the i, process, or
to the validity of the process upon its face.
The writ of y habeas corpus can never ba
i yoked for the , purpose fof â¢ bringing up
from an inferior court to the â  Superior; or
Supremo Court the facts of the vase, nor
the errors of law committed ac the trial. 1
In other words, the writ of ; habeas corpus
can never be made to serve the purpose of
a writ of error. ' h- v,'::y- ; ;â ' ;
"My friend, Mr. McEiierhey, has con
ceded the jurisdiction of the Senate over
the subject matter of the inquiry in so far
as it relates vto the , investigation of i the
charges of bribery of members of the Sen
ate, but he objects to its exercise of juris
diction over the part relating to the expos
ures of the scandals referred to :in this
newspaper-article. Well, ; now, if 4 the
court please, the principal object of that
investigation, and the only object of that
investigation, was to examine into the
charges made by the Examiner article of
ihe wholesale bribery of the Senate of the
State of Calilornia. It is true that the
resolution does contain a statement vitn
reference to scandal, but this is mere sur
plusage, and was not intended to and
could not confer any jurisdiction upon the
Senate with reference to an investigation
of this matter for the purpose of merely
exposing the scandal.
"The real object, I say, was simply to
make a lull ana complete investigation of
the^e charges, not against any particular
individual. There was no individual be
fore that Senate under investigation; it I
was an Investigation into a sweeping
charge made against the Senate of the
State of California in its entirety â a mat
ter, I say, not affecting the individual,
but the public interests; a matter of the
gravest and most profound public inter
est, rising far above individuals and made
for the purpo3Â« of protecting those public
in'crests by an investigation, having for
us object the discovery of the truth br
faisity of those charges, and if true in the
exercise of its constitutional power the re
pulsion of the dishonest and corrupt mem
bers of that body."
The Attorney-General then cited au
thority for authority, beginning with the
State constitution, which declares thai
any person mny be compelled to testify in
any lawful investigation, and shall not be
permitted to withhold his testimony on
the ground that it will subject him to dis
grace or infamy. He also quoted the sev
eral sections of ihe Political Code bearing
on the case, which reiterated in still more
specific language the terms of the consti
tution. The present contentions of privi
lege, he argued, were completely swept
away by these provisions.
"In a proceeding of this sort," he said,
'I sny that the Senate is not inferior to
the Supreme Court of this State. I say
that no steps taken by the Senate in the
exercise of its constitutional powers with
reference to the subject matter of investi
gation before it c;m be inquired into by
j this ci urt, and that the finding of the
Senate is absolutely conclusive upon tins
court."
He argued that the Senate did rot sit
as a court in this case to determine a con
troversy between private parties, but in
an inquisitorial capacity to investigate
charges affecting its honor and public uso
fulness. The facts themselves could not
be brought up here on a writ of habeas
corpus.
The Senate was really co-ordinate with
the Supreme Court in a case of this kind,
possessing as it did constitutional author
ity to protect itself in the same manner as
the latter in matters of contempt. Nor
was it to be presumed, nor was it ex
pected, that the rules of evidence which
obtained in controversies between indi
viduals be*fore the courts could be made to
apply to the Sencte, Cushing having
clearly declared the distinction between
private causes and inquisitorial proceed
ings.
He showed in conc'u ting his argument
ihat in the case of Levings the answer to
several qnestions merely involved a sim
ple negative or affirmative, so that the ex
cuse proffered in the case of A. M. Law
rence had no forcible application.
The clerk was ordered to keep the office
open after the regular hour, which pave
promise that the decision would be handed
down some time during the evening.
Sure enough, it came in shortly after 5
o'clock.
Lawrence and Levings are now out of
the hands of the Supreme Court and in
'he tende~'caie of a libeled and outraged
Senate. Unless an appeal be made to the
Federal couri, as is talked of, their quar
ters for some tlmo may be in the Sacra
mento County Jail.

SACK AMENTO, Cal., March 16. â It was
but a few minutes after the decision
of the Supreme Court was rendered when
the news was received in the Senate. It
spread like wildfirp, and within half an

ATHENB, Greece, March 16.â A pro

to-day. The Ministers discussed at great
length the attitude to be taken in the
event of the powers attempting to coerca
Greece into compliance with their de
mands. It is stated that no disposition
was shown to accede to the demands, and
that it was finally decided to take active
measures as the only possible solution of
the difficulty.
It is thought tbat by active measures is
meant a declaration of war against
Turkey, which in its effect would give the
right to Greece to maintain her army in
Greece and deprive the powers of any
right of interference.
Crown Prince Constantine with the
first regiment of infantry is momentarily
expected to leave Athene to assume com
mand of all the Greek forces in Thessaly.
The prevailing conviction here is that
war is inevitable.
It is understood that the Cabinet at its

LONDON, Bho., M^rch I(s.â The Stand
ard will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Athens saying that up to this time
the Government had received no official
notice that the fleets of the powers were
blockading the ports of Crete.
A dispatch from Vienna to the same pa
per says that the representatives of the
powers in Constantinople have been en
trusted with the scheme for the autonomy
for Crete.. Their work will be partly facil
itated by consultations with the Porte.
The Rome correspondent of the News
says that he has reliable information that
Greece is now disposed to adopt a concil
iatory attitude toward the powers. He
adds that Greece proposed to concentrate
her troops at some easily victualed point
on the coast of Creie where they will be
separated from the insurgents.
.She also proposes that the Ottoman
troops shall be placed at points removed
from the insurgents, so that. the powers
themselves may pacify the rebels. Then
it will bo expected that the Cretans will be
allowed to choose freely between
autonomy and annexation to Greece. If
they choose autonomy, the Greek and
Turkish forces will leave the island at the
same time.
Little reliance is placed on this dispatch
here. The powers insisted that their
Cem.i:.ds as set forth in the identical note
to Greece should be acceded to in their
entirety, and af.er Greece's reply to the
note had been received they refused to
enter into any further negotiations on the
subject. It has been repeatedly stated
that the powers would not consent to a
plebiscite in Crete to decide whether an
autonomous Government should be estab
lished or the island annexed to Greece,
and consequently it is believed it will be
impossible. that Greece should now make
such proposals." Furthermore, the powers
have decided that the Greek troops must
leave Crete before the Turkish forces, and
it is 10 compel compliance with these
demands that the blockade of the island

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â
President McKinley to-day sent to the

dor Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to
France.
Henry White of Rhode Island, secre
tary of embassy to Great Britain.
Colonel John Hay is an ideal man for
JOHN HAY of Washington, Embassador to the Court of St.
James.
the court of St. James. Colonel Hay is a
literary man well-known in Britain for
his books, 'Little Breeches," "Castilian
Days," "Pike County Ballads" and
others. Although he affects repentance
for the "ballads," they arc among the
robust and living, if a shade coarse, litera
ture of these times. They have never
been equaled by an American, if Bret
Harte is excepted. Apart from his
iit-rary genius. Colonel Hay is a man of
affairs. He has been secretary at Paris
and Madrid. He was charge d'affaires at
Vienna, and ho was President Lincoln's
secretary. He is learned, polished, deep,
familiar with the strange ways and mouth
tilling words of diplomacy, and is at ease
in any kind cf company. Colonel Hay is
59 years old, and has long been a resident
of Washington, where his bouse is one of
the most hospitable. It was here that he
wrote his "Lr.fe of Lincoln," which is re
garded as oue of the most valuable of the
contributions to the literature of the
United States. Colonel Hay is recognized
as a tine orator.
Genera! Horace Porter of New York, the
United States Embassador to Paris, got
fcis title in the Union army, ia which he
was a bricadier. Trained for a soldier, he
lived the life oi a aoHier and was an officer
ot the army until 1873, when be retired.
He was a warm personal friend of General
Grant as soldier and President, and was
Grant's representative at banquets or other
affairs where oratory was expected of
the prominent guests. This was before
Grant became a public speaker himseif.
General Porter thus became one of tho most
brilliant talkers in America, and now at 70
he may be said to be one still. When he re
tired from the army he became vice-presi
dent of the Pullman Palace Car Company
and liolds the office yet. Army menâ I
good array menâ always maka railroad
men, and General Porter is no exception
to that rule. For a quarter of a century
he has occupied important positions in
many of the great rai.ronds. He is
scholarly, rfliised, eloquent, witty and
thoroughly equipped to lii the important
post in Trance lor which he has teen se
lected. General Porter is oae of the most
entertaining after-dinner speakers in
America, another good reason why he
will do well abroad.

The elephant that was to be killed is 11
feet high and weighs three and a half
tons. :He has been with the show twenty
years and is vaiue lat $<5000. The ivory in
his tusks alone is estimated to be worth
j $000. The elephant developed a bad tem
per recently and has become a burden to
the show people. He could not be kept
safely with the other elephants and trie
lives of his keepers have been in almost
daily danger." 'â â 'â ' - .

phant'g carcass. The dose to bÂ« given Tip
was cyanide of potassium. Wallace
brought up a satchel filled with tlie ooi
son. Tip had been chained securely in
one corner of the eiephnnt-house. Double
chains had been fastened to his legs and
tusKs, as it was feared that in his death
Struggles he might brrfak loose.
All other aiepnants were taken nut of
the house at 12:30 nud Tip became the
center of interest. Wallace put two hand
fuls of the poison capsules in a pail of
mush. They had been coated with bees
wax in order that their effect might be
slow and easily observed. Tlie mush was
given to Tip and the crowd stood about in
breathless expectation. M:my looked to
see the huge body fall instantly to the
ground. Other< thought Tip might make
a dash for the door.
But Tip disappointed them all. He just
dranic v; the mush and apparently suai
out all of the capsules. Wallace insisted
that Tip had eaten some of the cai sules
and the spectators retained their wailing
attitude. Then apples were split open
and capsules inserted in them. Tip took
all these voraciously, but invariably
placed the crunched fragments of the cap*
suips on the ground with his trunic.
Wallace kept the spirits of the crowd ut>
by asserting that in the animal's stomach
there were two ounces of poison and
death would ba a matter of only a few
minutes. But the minutes wore into
hours, and still the elephant stood there
with ;he crowd watching him. More cap.
Â«ules were fed to the elephant, this time
in molas es. but ittill the crowd waited in
vain. Tip's stomach, Wallace asserted,
now contained more than four ounces of
poison. One ouhcp, he predicted, would
kill him. For six hours the visitors
watched that chphant, and for six hours
Tip only bilnked and looked sleepy.
Toward the end of the afternoon he
briphtene i up visibly, despite the doses
which had been administered to him.
Another attempt will be made to Kill him
to-day.

GETTING TO WORK
ON THE TARIFF
Ways and Means Commit
tee Hold a Three-Hour
Session.
Democrats Want Tims to Ex
amine the Bill Before It
Is Reported.
Republicans Think That Two Weeks
Should Su fice for Debate in
the H use.
WASHINGTON', D. C, March 16.â The
new tariff bill was considered to-day by
the Ways and Means Committee. The
session lasted three hours. The sugges
tion that the bill be reported on Thursday
met with strong opposition from the mi
nority. The Democrats insisted that they
only desired time in wn'ch to examine the
measure. The bill will probably be re
ported Thursday.
Dolliver stated in reference to the agri
cultural schedule that the changes were
1 more in form than in substance. Tne
duty on animals was less than the Mc-
Kmley rate. So far as oranges were con
cerned, the duty was assessed by the
pound instead of by bu.k, in order to
secure a more equitable adjustment in
the collection of the duty. The increased
rate on broken rice was made to cover the
evasion of the present law. Chxcory
root, hitherto free, was now dutiable at 3
cents a pound, inasmuch as the industry
had been recently established in the West
of preparing it as a substitute for ciffee.
Payne was asked as to the amount of
revenue the substitute schedule would
produce. He could not say, but thought
the increase would be about $16,000,000.
Robinson of Louisiana estimated the
revenue from su.^ar to bo $50,000,000.
It was developed incidentally that the
tariff on 95 per cent of the sugar importa
tions will yield an ad valorem duty of 72
per cent.
It wa3 decided at the afternoon meeting
of the committee that an adjournment
should be taken from this evening until
10 o'clock Thursday morning. The pur
pose of this was to permit the Democratic
members to study the bill and to prepare
any amendments which they propose
offering when the committee reassembles.
The minority wiil to-morrow afternoon
meet at the Capitol and decide upon the
line of policy to be pursued by them in
committee Â«nu in the House.
It isstili undecided if the bill shall be
reported Tliursdby, but the Democratic
members believe this to be the intention
o: tue majority. The understanding i*
that if the bi:J be reported Thursday it
will be at once taken up for consideration
without waiting tor the Democratic minor
ity to report. Some oi tue Republican
members think two weeks should suffice
for debating the measure in the House.
The liquor schedule was the first to be
considered this afternoon. Evans of Ken
tucky, who Has prominently identified
with this schedule's preparation, ex
plained its provisions. He showed bow
the diitv on brandy had been increased
from $1 80 to $2 60 a gallon, and pointed to
tbe advantages the wine-producers of
France would gain if that Government
should pire this country a corresponding
advantage on our exports. He showed
that the rales in the liquor schedule were
substantially a return to those in the Me-
Kiniey law.
Wheeler of Alabama referred to the
enormous profits which the manufacturers
of a certain grade of liquors enjoy in this
country owing '.o the excesive protection
which enables them to sell a cheap article
it enormous profit. The .present penalty
for the o practices is a fine, but Wheeler
contended that a heavy punishment by
imprisonment should also be added, as
the line in itself was not a sufficient deter
rent. His suggestion that the bill be
u mended in this particular was not
adopted, although several others ex
pressed their belief that it was sound in
j.rinclple.
HoTikins of Illinois, who explained the
provisions of the woolen schedule, de
tailed at some length the reason why Bag
dad wool, China lamb's wool, Castle
Branca, Adrian ople skin wool or butchers'
wool, such as have been heretofore im
ported into the United States from Ar
gentina, Australia, Russia, Egnyt, Mo
rocco and other countries, and which for
many years have been classified as wools
of the third class, were placed in class
one. They were, ha continued, found to
be of a superior quality, and in many re
spects equal to the best grade of Austral
ian wool and properly subject to the duty
of 11 cents a pound which had been placed
upon them.
Russell was next called upon to explain
the silk and paper schedules, which be
did in ex ten so. The latter schedule, be
--â -â¢ill, differed little if any from the present
low.
Itrntrbnck on Alcohol.
â¢ WASHINGTON. C, March 16. -The
Secretary vi the Treasury/ has announced
on the basis of an opinion of 'he Attorney-
General, that domestic alcohol re-im :

OFFICES FOR CAUFORNIANS.
Spear, Jackson and Kcwaiskv Will Be
Provided For, but De Young's Chances
Are Slim.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 16.â 1t
seems to be settled that Joe aiiear will be
appointed Collector of Customs at San
Francisco. Major McKinFey feels praleful
to Mr. Spear for organizing McKinley
clubs more than two years ago. He
regards Mr. Spear aa a safe business man,
and in no sense a politician. Mr. Spear
has engaged rooms at the Shoreham, and
will remain here for several weeks.
Colonel John P. Jackson will be taken
care of by Senator Perkins. He may be
made Postmaster when McCoppin's term
expires.
It is the general impression that M. H.
de Young wiil fail in his ambition to be
appointed Embassador to Italy. Some of
the California Republicans are making a
strong fiÂ«ht against him. Wuliam F.
Draper of Massachusetts will probably be
appointed.
The prospects of Colonel Kowalaky for
apt>oinimeni as Minister to Belgium are
not bright He is anxious tor tiiis place
in order to educate his daughter ai Brus
sels. It is understood that Henry C.
Payne of Wisconsin will be appointed to
Belgium. Co onel Kowalsky will be pro
vided for in some way, for, aÂ« in the cas?
ol Spear, the President believes he owes
him something ior having organized Mc-
Kinley clubs in California.
The Typographical Union is keeping up
its fight on Colonel Oiis. Representative

AN IMPROMPTU CONFERENCE.
Secretary of Stats Sherman Discusses
Grave Matters With the Committee
on Foreign Relations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 16.â There
is every indication of a much freer inter
change of views and of confidence between
the State Department and the Committee
on Foreign Relations of the Senate since
the advent of the new administration.
A visit of Secretary Stierman to the
Capitol this afternoon was entirely unex
pected, and the first that was known of
his visit was wLien, after big luncheon, a
messenger notified Chairman Davis tnat
Mr. Sherman was at the commit:ee-room.
An impromptu meeting was called, and
for an hour the committee and the new
Secretary of State conferred about our
relations with other powers.
Mr. Sherman was naturally anxious to
know what headway had been made with
the arbitration treaty, and when he was
told that it was expected to make a favor
able report to-morrow the Secretary ex
presse i his piea.-ure. It is well known
that President McXinley and his Secre
tary subscribe to the treaty and the pur
poses f r which it was negotiated, but be
lieve it should be amended in several par
ticulars.
There was also considerable discussion
relative to the construction of the Nic
araguan Canal, a question which is bound
to come prominently to the front during
this Congress. Mr. Sherman is favorable
to this project, but lias taken the grou-id
in bis speeches in the Semite that' the
canal should be constructed through the
instrumentality of the United S'.ates
alone, rather than through the agency of
a private corporation, aided and assisted
by (his Government in the matter of
bunds.

'"Their employment by '' contractors or
the army engineer*?" Hawley (R. ) of

"NEW YORK, K. V., March 16.- A press
special from Havana, via Key "West, Fla.,
says:
The news that Spanish forces have met
with a serious disaster in the west is con
firmed. It is learned from what is deemed
a reliable source that a train conveying
600 troops, while going from Artemisa to
*ome southern port, was blown up by
Gubans, more than 300 troops being killed
or wounded.
The details give a tragic coloring. The
Cubans had learned that the troops were
.to be sent on that train. They mined a
long high trestle crossing St. Carman
Channel. This bridge is more than fifty
Jte<"<- high. The mines were exploded as
the. train was passing over it, with ter
rible effect. Half of the entire train was
lifted up-aud thrown into the deep chan
nel below. _].:;Â£* : :t* J .-
. The force of the explosion was terrific,
the ground being torn up for a great dis
tance. The cries of the wounded ana the
shouts of those unhurt added excitement
and terror.
As the remainder of the troops rushed
oat of the ruins they were met with a
withering fire from the concealed Cubans,
and dozens were killed at the first volley.
The contest lasted an hour, the Spaniards
bravely fighting from behind the cars, but
it was useless and to save their lives they
surrendered.
â¢ The cars that had gone down caught
fire and were entirely destroyed, many sol
diers being caught in them and burned to
death. More than 300 troops were found
to be missing, and are supposed to have
been killed.
The Cubans lost possible forty men.
All the prisoners were released, save the
officers, who were held for the safety of
eight insurgent officers at Artemisa, who
Dad been sentenced to death by the Span
ish commander, and Colonel Penco, the
Cuban commander, sent word that if
these men were shot he would order his
hostages to be kilJeJ, and that twenty of
the soldiers would be shot, too, in re
venge for Cuban soldiers shot there last
, week. â¢ . I^. '"; -
It is said that the Cuban officers were
released from Artemisa.
FJLIBVSTt.IIS DISCTTSSED.
a Subject Jhnt Occu â¢><<â¢* the Attention of
th- fnbinet.
*}TJXaroy,-D. â¬Â March 16.â The
filibustering operations between thiscoun
i try and Cuba occupied the attention of
ttie Cabinet to-day. Attorney-General
M Kenna eava hi-* views i>f permitting
filibustering s'.earoer3 to clear for Cuban
ports with arras and munitions of war.
A general discussion followed bis re
marks.
The Attorney-General has decided not
to render an opinion in the case of the
Eteamer Dauntless until he can obtain ad
ditional facts relating to the application
of her owners to c!ear from Jacksonville
w.th arms find ammunition.
Under ordinary circumstances the ap
plication would be granted without ques
tion, but the fact that the Dauntless or
any other vessel would be obliged to clear
for some Cuban port held by the Spanish
put a new phase on the matter. The
cargo could not be landed there and the
vessel would be seized. This would make
it necessary for a yes el to attempt to land
the cargo at some noint along the coast,
and in order to deliver the arms and am
munition to the insurgents an armsd force
would be necessary.
Tne knowledge of this raises ihe ques
tion whether the men who are to carry out
tte plans maae for a filibustering vessel
would not constitute an armed expedition
â a clear violation of the law. The Attor
ney-General will have to decide whether
tne force that is likely to be taken on the
Datrntless is an armed expedition within
the meanine of the law. Permission was
given the steamer Commodore to clear for
a Cuban port with arms and munitions of
war, bat the vessel was wrecked before
reaching the Cuban coast.

The Ship Litfcom His Been Sold and
Captain Brunings Will Take
Ccmmcnd of Her.
Many men have made fortunes through
going "down to the sea in ships," wfcile
others have met with nothing but mis
fortune. In the old days the clipper bark
Comet made money for all who handled
her, but latterly she has been a hoodoo,
and every man who has paid purchase
money on her has lost it.
Several years ago J. H. Conradt, the
dentist, purchused an interest in the ves
sel and he and his associates at once pro
ceeded to repair her. They paid $8000 for
the clipper and spent another $30*0 in
making her spick and span.
When ready for sea Captain Kirk was
given command and he took her to
Shanghai. Wliile trading on the Chinese
coast the owners got dissatisfied and sent
out Captain Broadhurst to relieve. The
latter skipper will be remembered as the
man who lost the Alicia at the entrance
to the harbor of Apia, in the Sanioan
group. When he left here he had a power
of attorney to handle the vessel and sell
her whenever he had a good opportunity.
A few days after taking command Broad
hurst .sailed for Chee Foo on the Yellow
River. While making the entrance the
Comet went ashore on the northeast head.
She was afterward got oft' und taken back
to Snanghai, where she was repaired.
Bills began to pour in and finally the ves
sel was attached. As there was no money
in sight she was put up at public auction
and sold to n man named Morrisey lor
$3000. It took almost that amount to
cover the expenses, so the owners are out
and injured. By last accounts Captain
Broadhurst was still in command oi the

board last week in a partially intoxicated
condition and when reprimanded by the
officer of the day looked in his face anrt
told him to go to a pines of torment. He
was at once pinced under arrest an I was
court-martialed ysterday. He was found
guilty nnd was sen;enced to one montn in
"the brii.',"" to serve one niton th on "police
duty" and to lose one month's pay.

and telegraph editor of the Bulletin,
leaves for a trip to Hilo on the ship
Roderick Dhu to-morrow. Mr. Sheridan

The Haroor Commissioners held a very
short session yesterday. What little busi
ness did come up was laid over until next
meeting, as Ci mmissioner Cole is at
present in Sacramento. Among the mat
ters that went, over was the question of
substituting kiln-dried Oregon pine for
oak in the interior finishing of the new
leiry depot, the question of removing
solicitors from the btockton steamers and
the request of the Pacific Pine Lumber
Company to reduce ihe rate of wharfage
on Berry street.
The captain of the British ship Grenada
had a tilt with the board. He went up to
Port Co-tta without paying his whariiige
bill, and a collector was sent after him.
He was compelled to pay $3 50 for ex
penses, and objected to that amount. As
fie was liable to a penalty of $600 ana the
United Suite? 3dnr>hal might have been
sent to collect the money, Captain Korff
should consider that he hag got off very
light.
When the British ship Lathom soiled
from San Francisco last December no one
ever expected to see her change her flar.
She has pone over to the Germans, however,
and in future will fly the flag of the house
of Waijen, whose handsome cralt, the C.
Â±i. WaijÂ»n is now in port. The Lathom
is a hand-orne ship of 2385 tons net regis
ter, and will thus be one of (he largest
vessels in the German mercantile marine.
The Lathom is now loading at Swansea for
San Francisco.
Captnin Bruninps, the popular and ac
complished master of the C. H. Watjen,
now in j ort, will bring the Lathom to tan
Francisco. He received a cable yesterday
to leave at once for England, and wns in
formed that Captain Kobbe was on his
way here to relieve him. What the new
master v, ill be like remains to be seen,
but everybody knows Captain Brunings.
Since he came here as mate of a German
vessel in 1874 he has always made frionds.
In 1882 lie was here as the master of the
Josefa, and for tlj,e last seven years he has
been corning here reipularly in the A'at
jen. His promotion entitles him to the
honor of placing after his name the ini
tials showing that he is an oliicer of the
German naval resprve.- The jolly captain
will receive an ov.uion when he comes
back again as rna>ter of the handsome
clipper Lathom.

STAIEWAYS MAY BE ABOLISHED
The Incline Plane M:Â»y Yet Be Intro
duced Into Our Home*.
The buildings of the future may have
neither elevators or stairways as those de
vices nre understood now. Tne latest in
vention is an inclined elevator. It is prac
tically a moving incline plane, running on
sprocket wheels at the top and at the bot
tom, with a handrail moving at the aims
rate of speed. The person who wants to
go from a higher to a lower floor or con
trariwise simply stepson the incline plane
ana is carried upward or downward with
out jurring or uncomfortable sensations of
any kind. They are so constructed that
it is not necessary to step off. The pas
senger is literally "delivered" without any
effort on his part, and without any danger
of accidents. It is an application of the
movable sidewalk which has Deen dis
cussed since tne World's Fair. It is be
lieved with this device upper stories will
be made as accessible and as agreeable as
the lower stories.
The incline elevators are completely
under tne control and are started or
{ stopped at the pressing of a button. In
buildings in which the stream of people
is continuous the incline plane can be
Kejit continually moving. In otnera they
can be run only when needed. The de
vice of merely pressing a button does
away with the necessity of elevator men
and boys. They are also believed to bs
less dangerous than the ordinary elevator
boxes winch slide up ana dowa grooves.
Whet her the incline plane could be lued in
iweniy-story buildings or even '.en-story
buildings is another question. It would
necessitate a great many changes and
woulu consume too much time. The in
clined plane is a good device to connect
lirsi and second stories or to facilitate en
trance to the elevated railways in the
cities. â lowa State Register.

"THE CALL'S" SPECIAL WRITERS AND ARTISTS IN CARSON.
ONE WORD FROM
SILER AND THE
BATTLE BEGINS
On the Eve of Their Struggle
Both Gladiators Are
Confident
EACH IS IN RARE CONDITION.
Corbett the Choice of the Experts and Heavy
Bettors â Attendance Will Be Light
and Dan Stuart Is a
Loser.
CARSON, Nev., March 16.â When all
the tickets are taken in at Dan Stuart's
mammoth arena to-morrow and the box
offics receipts are counted up, it will be
found that the big Texan lias met an
other financial Waterloo. Stuart deserves
sympathy, for he went into this gigantic
protest with enthusiasm and spent money
lavishly in order to make it a success. He
is probably "in the hole" at least $50,000
to-night. Not enough tickets have been
sold to come anywhere near paying ex
penses.
There is a large-sized string attached to
the kinetoscope concession. The latter is
really Stuart's only hope. If the day is
good and is clear enough for photography
and the machine works as it should, he
may eel out of Carson without having to
walk; but with these ticklish conditions
attached be can see no sure money at all.
And even this does r.ot near the end of
his trouble. I referred in my dispatches
last night to the fact that Martin Julian,
Bob Fitzsimmons' manager, had come into
town with a complaint to the effect that
he and nis brother-in-law were not getting
â¦nough out of the Kinetoscope privilege.
Fitzsimmons had been promised by Stnart
fifteen per cent, and Corbett the same.
Julian thinks now that Stuart is liable to
make too much money and wants the
sharing to be done on tbe basis of one
third each, that is â Fitzsimmons, Corbett
and Stuart. This was the demand he
made laÂ«t evening, and Stuart told him
that he would never agree to it. Martin
went away in a huff, but came back to-day
with a new demand. He had been doing
gome figuring, he said, upon what might

Ddaney, Will Second Him in the Ring. ,
1 ba Stuart's profit out of the kinetoscope
experiment, and he decided that if it was
successful $13,000 would be little enough
for Fitzsimraons. Julian said he wanted
this amount in advance and in cash. Mr.
Stuart, while inclined to scorn the rotund
little manager's proposition, abstained
from indulging in strong language. It
i would not do, he argued to himself, to
have a row with Julian or Fitzsimmons at
this late stage of the game and jeopardize
the tiiiht. He was quite conciliatory, and
invited Martin in:o the rear room of his
headquarters for a quiet little talk.
Just what transpired there nobody
knows, and neither Julian nor Stuart will
I tell; but whatever it was it evidently was
to Julian's satisfaction, for he went awny
weaiing a pleased expression and a tri
umphant, swagger. I am given to under
stand that Stuart, after explaining about
the contingency upon which hinged the
â  kinetoscope privilege, promised to raise
Fitzsiromons' allowunce in case the pic
tures proved to be a success.
The heavy falling cff of tbe Eastern
i visitors to the fight is something that has
j hurt Stuart's pocket seriously. When he
was making his plans for tbe arena he
was given reason to believe that at least
twenty special trainloads of snorts would
set sail for Carson from such cities as
New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cin
cinnati, New Orleans, Chicago, St. Louis
and Salt Lake City, and that these, joined
with tbe throngs that promised to come
I from California ami Oregon, would easily
I make up a crowd of at least 25,000 specra
j tors. With such an attendance at the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1897.
mission, a golden future â¢was staring him
in tue lace. The Californians have ful
filled the Texan's expectations, but the
Easterners, from whom he expected his
greatest support, have "thrown him
down," as the expression goes. Out of all
specials talked about in the East only
one is on the way, and that is simply a
remnant of what the Siler-Hogan excur
sion of a series of trains was intended to
be. Tnere are about eighty aboard, in
stead of the 1200 counted upon. All the
other Eastern specials were abandoned
entirely, because of lack of enthusiasm
and a desire to cling to, rather than part
with, dollars.
"The trouble is," said Billy Madden, in
attempting to explain the Eastern short
coming to-night, "the kind of people who
usually attend these sort of affairs have
not cot money to spare nowadays as they
had in tne good old days. They all re
tain their customary zeal over prizefights
and their hankering for seeing them. I
know hundreds of yports who would be
only too glad to journey to Caraon, but
they could rot rake together a healthy
enough pile. There is another thing that
hurts the fight, and it is the impression
JAMES J COREETT.
that prevailed through the East that Car
son was nothing but a dinner station and
that besides being btnied beneath snow it
could not accommodate a hundred visit
ors, much less several thousand. They
had visions of tramping around all night
on sleet-covered sidewalks, bedless and
hungry, and did not like the prospect.
They stayed away rather than take a
chance."
Madden does not know all. One of the
greatest injuries the bi^ project received
(and tnis is admitted by Stuart himself)
was trie publication of a story to the effect
that Corbettana Fitzsimmona met one
morning la*l week on a highway and in
dulged in a quarrel for the particular ben
efit of an "exclusive" San Francisco jour
nal. The story itself was all right enough
because of its spectacular attributes, even
if It had been true, but what hurt Stuart
wns the development th&t both Corbett
and Fitzsimmous accepted money for the
parts they played. This caused thÂ« sport
ing world to grow suspicious. They ex
changed knowing winks and whispered
that if Corbett and Fi'zsiramons would
accept money for engaging in a little
trick like that highway episode they could
le induced to engage in a fake fight for a
proper sized sum.
Some people are already glad to have a
chance to point out that the fight is not to
be "on the square," and they can be
scarcely blamed on account of the fre
quency with which big events of this
character have turned out tc be disap
pointments. A story floated out from the
East at least a month ago to the effect
that either Corbett or Fitzsimmons had
agreed to "Jay down" at Carson for a very
large sum of money, but when this was
run down it did not reach any reliable
source. The rumor, however, did its dam
ace and refused to die out, notwithstand
ing tiie fact that both men were training
harder than they ever had in their lives,
and that their bitterness toward each
other had grown apparently to tremend
ous proportions.
Now Dan Stuart feels the effects. Peo
ple will not journey across tbe continent
to see a fight to which is attached the
slightest shadow of suspicion. This is
not saying that anything wrong has been
noticed in connection with the prelimina
ries of the fight of the century, and I only
refer to it as an illustration to show why
it is that Stuart's vast arena will not hold
the thousands to-morrow that he ex
pected.
True to their promises neither Corbett
nor Fitzsiramons did any work to speak
of to-day. In fact the Cornishman made it
a complete holiday and did not take his
customary spin into town. After break
fast this morning he donned his working
clothes and heavy shoes, and in company
with two of his trainers went out for a
jog on the road leading from Cook's ranch
to the Nevada penitentiary. Here Fitz
-Bimmons pat in half an hour frolicking
with the guards and other prison attaches,
took a bath in the hot mineral plunge and
then sped home. His run dia not take in
over three miles altogether. He termed it
I simply a little loosening up exercise, in
tending to keep his joints easy and wind
on tap. 7 'I ha rest, of the day was con
sumed in lounging about the ranch and
talking with the many visitors who went
out to hare a look at the man who hopes to
win the world's championship laurels from
James J. Corbett to-morrow. . ,
The fact that only one day was left to
tell the tale of : the ' preat. battleâ one day
between Fltz and ; his futureâ had no ap
parent effect on the temperament of this
famous lanky fighter. To all appearanco
he was os confident as ever of the outcome
of the meeting, and when talking of to
morrow's event was careless and even flip
pant. He adhered to his old story that
the fight would be short and sweet. He
does not expect the tight to last over eight
rounds at the outside. .,. , ,-
Fitzsimmons will do no work whatever
to-morrow morning with the exception of
a little jaunt of a mile or so before break
fast. He will then ; rest until 9 o'clock
and in company with Roeber. Steizner,
Hickey and Julian will drive in to the
arena."." .;â â 'â¢' Â£' - ' '

keep himself limber and to hold bis wind
Jim went out on the road and took a jog
to within a few hundred yards of Carson.
This was repeated in the afternoon. The
conclusion of the latter performance was
a grand sprint for his training quarters,
the bit; fellow covering a distance of at
least a quarter of a mile.
"This is my last run, boys," be shouted
as he passed a party of friends driving in
from the springs.
Jim intends to take a half-mile run
early in the morning. This is scarcely
customary with pugilists on the morning
of a great battle; but Corbett has asserted
all along that he is differently constituted
from most fighters and requires a differ*
ent line of work. He says he has
always found it beneficial to indulge in
a sharp but not protracted sprint some
hours before entering tbe ring, and he
does not intend to diverge from the prac
tice on this occasion.
It was announced to-night that Billy
Madden, the celebrated Eastern sport and
manager of champions of the arena, had
been selected to act as master of cere
monies to-mojrow at the amphitheater.
Billy Jordan, whose familiar voice and
figure have graced every ring event of
prominence in San Francisco, is here in
Carson, and it was the ambition of Jor
dan's friends to have him serve at to
morrow's great event, well knowing that
the old chief would thus be rendered the
proudest man on earth. Bat fate and the
light promoters ruled against "Our Billy."
Maddens friends had the inside pull and
Jordan can now earn no more distinction
than serving as one of "those prominent
at the ringside."

Martin will retire and take a seat beside
his sister, Mrs. Fitzsimmons.
It is not al together settled to-night just
who will be in the corner with Corbett.
It was thought several days ago that the
matter had been disposed of. Jim had
announced that bis handlers in the ring
would be Charley While, the old reliable
Billy Delaney and big JackMcVey; but
since i his decision was reached Prolessor
John Donaldson, who Las served in Cor
beti's corner in most of the Californian's
battles, has arrived in Carson, and so has
Jim Carr of San Francisco, who was be
hind the Olympic Club idol in his famous
barge figtit with Joe Cboynski.
Both of these late arrivals are reckoned
as mascots for Corbett â they consider
themselves as such and so does Jim him
self. The limit to the number of seconds
allowed in '.he ring has been placed at
three. White and Delaney cannot be spared
and so it remains lor the third choice to
be made between Donaldson, Carr and
McVey. The big wrestler is satisfied to
withdraw and the question is now whether
Donaldson or Carr will go along with Cor
bett to the ring.
In response to a notice sent oat by Dan
Stuart, William A. Brady, representing
Corbett, and Martin Julian, manager for
Fitzsimmons, met this evening at the big
Texan's headquarters for the purpose of
determining which corner of the ring the
respective fighters were entitlpd to. As is
customary in such affairs the flipping of a
com was to settle this important matter.
Brady produced a big round dollar from
his jeans, and proffering it to Julian, gen-
e rously asked him t o toss. Ju lian foronca
in his life was in an amiable mood and
would not veiirnt himself to be outdone
by Brady in an exchange of courtesies.

won. In consequence Corbett will to
morrow occupy the corner thai will leave
the sun shining upon his back and, pos
sibly, in his opponent's eyes. There is a
difference of opinion about this being an
advantage, for as the fight will take place
close to the noon hour the sun will
naturally be directly overhead and will
inconvenience neither of the pugilists so
far as corners are concerned. But as it is
always considered a good omen to win
the toss, the Corbett camp is accord
ingly quite jubilant to-night over Brady's
luck.
While Brady and Julian were together
the formality of inspecting the gloves to
be worn by the big fighters was under
taken and disposed of. When Corbett's
gloves were exhibited Fitzsimmon*' man
ager scrutinized them most minutely,
picked them over, peeked inside and,
fitting them to his hands, tested them
against the wail. Finally, hand ine them
back, to Stuart, Julian said that he would
not permit them to be used in the fight.
He asserted th* the se&ms had, to all ap
pearance, been purposely left unfinished
and consequenty rough and liaDle to
scratch and injure Fitzsimmons. He also
objected to the manner in which the right
clove bunched up over the first knuckle.
All thjs, he said, with a significant shake
of the head, indicated that the gloves had
been "made to order."
Brady, not to be outdone by the little
manager, immediately found a number of
alleged flaws in Fitzsimmons' mittens.
He said that they were under weight and
hai been spread out so as to offer the
Cornishman's hands as thin a surface of
padding as possible.
Brady and Julian always wrangle when
they get togetlier, and ihis developed into
an unusually hot one. Stuart, as usual,
interceded as peacemaker. After a long
talk, i:i which both managers used strong
language and matters began to look as if
there was going to be a rerious breach,
Stuart finally suggested that the faults,
it lav ts there Tvere, found in the gloves
were ar, bad on one siJe as on the other,
and that eac i side could well afford to
withdraw its objections. Brady said he
was willing, ant then stared at Julian.
Martin hesitated a moment and then
turned away, saying:
"Let her go."
So the gloves will go on the hands of the
fighters just as they are, ana just as they
were made. They will remain in Dan
Stuart's possession until they are needed
in the ring.
Julian and Wyatt Earp bumped into
each other on Carson street this afternoon,
and Julian, remembering his late ex
perience in the Sharkey-Fitzsimmons fight
in SÂ»n Francisco, could not r sist the
temptation to snap at the man who carries
the gun. Earp was in a retaliatory mood
and talked back. Bystanders thought
there was going to be a ruix-up. but it was
o;i!y a war of words after all, and the only
demonstrative conduct was a shaking of
Jis;s. Julian said Earp was a robber and
Earp said Julian was a squealer.

WATSON'S PREDICTION.
Olympic Club Expert Be
lieves Three Californians
Will Win.
CARSON. New, March 16. â I visited
Corbett at his training quarters at Shaws
Sj>rincs to-day. I found him surronndea
by a lot of friends, including a crowd of
Olympic Club men from San Francisco and
quite a delegation of Eastern SDorting
men, -including Frank Stevenson of New
York, the well-known referee, backer and
authority on pugilism ; Warren Lewis of
New York, another prominent sporting
man, who was for years the backer of Jack
Dempeey; and Dr. Langdon, the vice
prenident of the New York Athletic Club.
Corbett seemed to me to be in better
condition than I ever saw him before in
his life, and that is saying a good deal, as
Corbett was given all liis preliminary in
structions in the art from me and I have
seen him prior to every battle in which he
has fought
He spoke of my having instructed him
in the presence of a large crowd out to
his place, and laughingly remarked that I
would either be proud or ashamed of him
ty-morrow. I replied, "I guess I'll be
proud of you, Jim."
As I have said, he looked to be in splen
did condition. His eyes were bright, his
cheeks were healthy looking, his skin
clear/and he was lively and full of vim
and confidence. He should weigh about :
180 pounds, which is the best weight he j
could fight at.
I had a long talk with Corbett after he
was through shaking hands witn the!
crowd which was there to greet him. He j
said he never felt better and that he was j
perfectly confident of winning. He said j
Corbett Takes His Last Cross-Country Run Before the Fight.
ROBERT FITZSIMMONS.
' the length of the fight would depend
largely on Fnzsimmons; that if Fitz
simmons cut out a rapid pace from the
start the tight would not last more than
six rounds, but that if he (Corbett) had to ;
CO after him it might last much longer.
He was perfectly satisfied with his con
dition, and said that if he did not win it
would not be on account of his condition.
He said lie had taken a nice walk this
morning, and was going to take another
after 1 left. It is hard for his trainer to
make him stop working, and he wears
| them all out.
There was a constant stream of visitors
j out to Corbett's place all day long, and
Mr. Slingerman, the proprietor of Shaws
i Springs, told me that there had probably
: been 1000 poorle there up to the time I
| left. It is about two miles from Carson
I City and the road is lined with buses car-
I rying passengers back and forth, most of
whom seemed to be personal friends of
the champion and all of whom insisted on
shaking bands witn him and offering
their best wishes for his success to-mor
; row. Corbett's friends here outnumber
Fitzsimmons' by rive to one.
After leaving Corbett I drove ever to
Cook's ranch to see Fitzsimmons, but the
big Australian bad just started out for a
long walk, which was to have be*n his
last active exercise betore the fight. There
were a great many visitors to Fitzsim
mons also, but there did not seem to be
many who claimed a personal acquaint- j
ance with him, and they were drawn
there more out of curiosity or a desire to
see him and compare his condition, build,
etc., with Cortett.
FitzÂ«immons seemed to be in excellent
shape, of which I have not the slightest
doubt, as he was always a conscientious j

trainer and takes pood care of himself.
Fitzsimmons will enter the ring weighing
; about 170 pounds.
I introduced Dan Stuart to Billy Jordan
this afternoon, telling him Jordan wouM
make a fine master ol ceremonies as he bad
| acted in that capacity at every prominent
| fight that had taken place in San Francis
| co and vicinity for the pasi riiteen years.
; Stuart said he had had some talk with
Billy Madden, who formerly managed
John L. Sullivan, Joe Goddard, Peter
Maher, Jack McAuliffe and other big
fighters, and had decided to tender the
I honor to bim. Jordan felt a little disap
j pointed because ne could not officiate.
J do not think there will be as big a
crowd here as was expected, in fact the
general impression is the attendance will
fall considerably under Stuart's estimate.
At the outside there will not be more than
5000 people present.
I went out to the amphitheater, which
{ is built in the center of the racetrack.
First the outside fence surrounding the
racecourse has to be pasted, and inside of
this there is another fence about tiftaen
feet high, inclosing the seats and the ring.
The seating arrangements are excellent,
chairs being placed close to the ring for
tne more expensive seats, and back of
these are raised seats costing |20, $10 and
$15. The ring is raised about four feet,
directly in the center, and will be in plain
view of all.
I heard to-night that Corbett had won
the toss for choice of corner?, and selected
the southeast corner. As the tight takes
place about 11 o'clock, one will be about as
good as the other.
It is Dan Stuart's intention to pull off
ell three fights to-morrow, instead of
holding the two minor contests until
Thursday, as he at tirst intended to do.
This will be more satisfactory to most of
the visitors, and is the best arrangement,
as after the big light they will want to get
out of town as soon as possible.
I have seen the two California boys,
George Green and Dal Hawkins, who are
to meet Billy Smith and Martin Flaherty,
respectively. They are both in splendid
shape and I confidently look upon them
as winners. In fact, after a careful study
of all the various contestants in the three
fights, I am strongly inclined to the
opinion that the three Californians â Cor
bett, Green and Hawkins â will win.
The weather here to-dey was quite
agreeable, but the night is clouding up
and a cold wind blowing and snow is pre
dicted, if it should rain or snow during
the fight it would be very disagreeable for
the contestants and the audience, but the
fights will not be postponed on this or any
, similar account.
The latest order is that Corbett and
Fitzsimmons are to be in their dressing
rooms to-morrow morning at 10 o'clocK
and ready to enter the ring by 11.
There is a big crowd of snorting men
here and the betting has beon qjite brisk
among them, though no particularly large
wagers have been recorded. The odds here
are: Corbett-Fitzsimmons 10 to <% Green-
Smith even money, Flaherty-Hawkins 10
to 8.
John L. Sullivan is expected in town on
a late train to-night, and a band of music
and most of the visitors and residents wili
be at the depot to greet him and escort
him uptown. The prospective arrival of
John L. i.as created considerable talk.
Tom Sharkey is here, but I have not heard
him say anything about challenging the
winner at the ringside.

"BUT ONE MAN IN IT."
"Parson" Davies Says Corbett
Has the Fight Already
Won.
CARSON, Nev., March 16.â "Parson"
Davies, whose name all men interested in
athletic sports are familiar with, was
about the most conspicuous man in the
crowd that gathered in the streets of Car
son to-day to discuss the big battle of to
morrow. Davies' hair is now as white as
a snowball, and when asked why the
stranpe change in his hirsute adornment,
the "Parson" smiled and in his own
pleasant way said:
"Why, my dear fellow, all animals of
the high or low creation change to white
in snow-clad countries."
I found the "Parson" as affable and as
willing as ever to chat on matters sportive.
When I put to him the question that is
being put by everybody, "Who do you
think will win the battle?" he did not
hesitate a second in answering: "Why,
there is only one man in the game, and
that man's name is James J. Corbett. I
could not have answered you had I not
seen the gentleman, and I pledge you my
word that I have never seen an athlete
â oarsman, boxer or sprinter â in better
form to contest for a life, if neces
sary, than is the Californlan to-day.
MARTIN FLAHERTY, the Opponent of Dal Hawkins.
Ha is a perfect specimen of physical
manhood, and knowing as I do
his remarkable cleverness, I for the life of
me cannot see how he can be defeated.
Mark you, this man Fitzsimmons is one
of the hardest punchers I have ever seen,
but he cannot hit Corbett as he has hit
other men; consequently, I can see only
one mÂ»n in the earns. I may be wrong,
but you have aste^d m^ for ruy opinion,
and there it is. Yes, I am going to San
Francisco, and I intend to remain In that
beantiful city three or four months, dur
ing which time 1 may pull off somo ath
letic affairs. You know I am always in
terested in something sporty."
"I see, Mr. Davies, by the New York
Journal that Peter Jackson has signified
his intention of challenging the winner."
"Well now, my dear fellow, that is ab
surd. Peter Jackson was a grand fighter
in his day, but like poor old John L., the
colored gladiator has run his race, and I
am certain that bo will never enter the
prize ring again. Peter Jackson is too wise
.- man to issue a challenge unless it was
backed up by good hard coin, and if some
of the pugilists who are always writing
challenges to the newspapers would send
a money order along to back up their
statements there would be more fighting
and less talking among the alleged cham
pions.
"By the way, this man Charley Mitchell
is out with a challenge to tight the win
ner. Well, he can afford to leave FitzÂ»ini
mons and Corbett severely alone. If he
really wants to fight somebody, and will
put up coin to prove that he means busi
ness, I will name two men who will meet
him in a limited contest or a contest to a
finish for $5000 a Bide."
"Now. Mr. Davies, do you really think
that Fitzsimmons and Corbett will fight to
win the heavy-weight championship to
morrow?"
"Why should I have any reason to
think otherwise? Are not both of the
men trained to the hour? And it means
thousand* of dollars in the pockets of the
winner. I cannot see what object either
man would have in throwing the fight.
If Fitz3inimons was to go out, why, com
mon-sense would tell you that be would
be at least selling at even money, which
would come in so heavily toward the end
that he would finish a strong favorite. Is
not that a fact? No; I am just as posi
tive that the best man will win as I am of
eating breakfast to-morrow morning. I
am sure Fitzsimmons has not sold out, as
he really believes that he will whip Cor
bett in short order."
"How about that invitation Dan Stuart
sent you to stay away from Careon? It
was reported that you had said the fight
was eoing to be a fake."
"Well, now, don't that sound ridicu
lous? Why should I say so? I met Mr.
Stuart on my arrival here, and we hau a
hearty shake of tha hands. Nothing was
mentioned concerning ray statement of
fate or Mr. Stuart's invitation to me to
stay away from the fight. The whole
thing was faked. I nra here, ana that is
evidence in itself that fie matter is not
worthy of attention. My brother, V. R.
Davies, will arrive this evening in charge
of a special from Chicago, which will carry
with it the noblest hero of them ailâ John
L. Sullivan." M. J. Geary.
OPINIONS OF SPORTS.
Experts on Ring Contests
Say the Figfot Will Not
Last Long.
CARSON. New, March 16.â The last
twelve Hours of daylight remaining before
the greatest struggle in the history of
pugilism begins were ushered in with low
ering sines and a threatening atmosphere.
Fortunately these conditions, which
threatened to put a damper on the
spirits of all concerned in the big event,
did not last long, and after a tussle old Sol
came to the front, but the outlook had the
effect of making both Corbett and Fitz
simroons do a little more work than they
had intended to do on the day before the
battle. Fearing to take any chances under
existing atmospherical conditions, both
men exercised with a view to keeping
their wind up in case of a possible post
ponement. Nothing short of a rain or
snowstorm will bring about snch a possi
bility, and all the indications tend toshow
that fair weather will be vouchsafed to
morrow.
The looked-for specials from East and
West arrived to-day and discharged addi
tions to the crowd, which already has
severely taxed the resources of the town.
The attendance at the ringside will not be
as large as was Anticipated. Between
3000 and 3500 people is, perhaps, a careful
I estimate of the number who will see the
meeting of the two men which it took
nearly two years and the expenditure of
thousands of dollars to bring about.
Visitors kept arriving and departing
from Shaws Springs ana Cook's ranch
all day. and the roads between Carson
and the training quarters presented a
busy scane, with a constant stream of
vehicles of all kinds passing to ana fro.
P. J. Corbett, Jim's father, arrived by one
of the Western specials shortly before
noon. William A. Brady met Corbett
senior at the depot and drove him out to
the springs, where they found Jim busy
entertaining a number of friends from all
over the States. For each and every one
the big fellow nad a pleasant greeting and
a cheerful, confident word. In fact, Cor
bett never seemed in better spirits since
he began training than he did on this, the
eve of the contest which carries with it
the future of the winner both as to fame
and fortune.
Fitzsimmons' visitors had to wait some
time before he put in an appearance at
tne ranch, as Bob was making hay while
the sun shone and taking advantage of
the bright spell to do some jogging along
the road. When he returned and had had
a rnbdown he was in evidence, and his
conversation showed just as much faith
in his winning star as his rival displayed.
This overwhelming confidence on both
sides is a bit of a puzzle to all the sports.
It is undoubtedly genuine in Bob and Jim,
and tends to still further shake up the
ideas of any one who is inclined to waver
about picking the winner.
If the victory had to be decided by the
amount of confidence entertained by the
rivals, the referee would have a much
harder task than that which will be under
taken by Referee George Siler to-morrow,
and the contest would probably be pro
longed to a mucn greater degree than is
looke I for under Queensberry rules. The
prevailing opinion seems to be that the
duration will be limited to fifteen rounds.
Judging by the belting:, this number is
the fovorhe, while under ten rounds comes
in as second choice. No one is inclined to
think that the battle will be along one.
The interpretation of the rules, which
allows hitting in clinches and on the
breakaways, appears to account in a great
measure for the popular idea of a short
fight. Dan Stuart, it is evident, assumes
with the majority, since he has put on the
two smaller fights to follow the big event.
The betting remained about the same
to-day. There is plenty of Corbett money
in sight, but Fitzsimmons cash is not
forthcoming in sufficlen l quantity to make J
the pencilers change the odds from #% to
10 on the Californian. Paris niutuals with
Coibett, Green ana Hawkins as the pick
of the combinations were very slow, and
there were scarcely any buyers for fitz
simmons, Smith and Flaherty.
It was not quite the day of rest at the
camps that was anticipated, although both
men let up considerably and dispensed
with the sparring end of the programme
entirely.

An Indiana legislator wears the laurel

It is to be regretted that the new tariff
does not piace a duty of 2]^ cents a pound
on Zante currants as well as on other
raisins, but the proposed duty of 1% cents
will do until we can educate the Eastern
people on the subject and convince them
that the so-called "Zante currant" doesn't
come from Zante and isn-'t a currant.
The reciprocity features of the new
tariff are larger oven than those of the
McKinley bill, under which Secretary
Blame was able to do so much to advance
the commerce of the country, and Secre
tary Sherman will therefore have an op
portunity to develop tbe policy of his
great predecessor and mane it a perma

Mr. Dingier wjm able to accompany the
report of bis tariff bill to Congress with
the announcement that as a whole it has
the unanimous support of all Republican
members ot the Ways and Means Com
mittee. The statement pives encourage
ment to t!ie hope that it will find an
equal favor with all Republicans in Con
gress and that we shall have the bill
enacted and put into force without un
necessary delay.
The statement of the Governor that
Senate b:il 4M was twice sent to him in
incorrect lorm justly raises a suspicion of
foul ;>!:iy to defeat the measure, and the
investigation should not stop until the
guilty parties nave been found ana evi
dence obtained to convict them. Errors,
of course, are inevitable in any sort of
business, but when errors occur twice in
the same way in the same bill it is clear
there is bad business somewhere.
John Hay, tht newiy appointed Erubas

literary man. He has, in fact, many
talents of many kinds. He wrote "Little
Breeches." It remains to bÂ» seen if he
can resist the blandishments of a dinner

brilliant chance to distinguish himself as
an offset to Bayard, and perhaps he will
know enough to make bis hay while the

REMANDED TO JAIL.
The Supreme Court has heard ihe defense which Andrew Lawrence and L. L.
Levings of the Examiner hod to make for their refusal to cive evidence concerning the
truth of their charge that members of tne Senate were bribed to vote lor Assembly
bill 273, and having heard it has remanded tho culprits to jaii.
The decision ol the court was not unexpected. Ihe offense of the Examiner was
so vicious, and the contempt of the Senato on the part of the men who were responsi
ble for the publication of the charge of '-bribery in aid of thievery" was so impudent,
that their attorneys could mnke no defense for them. The Justices of the Supreme
Court required hardly five hundred words in which to state the facts of the case, re
fute the plea put forward by the culprits and order their return to the Sheriff of Sac
ramento County.
The puoiic is familiar with the whole story. The Exavi inn in express terms as
serted that bribery had been used to pass Assembly bill 273. It made the charge ab
solute and without qualification. It stated the amounts ihat had been paid to Sena
tors and Assemblymen. The managers and the Sacramento correspondents of the
Examiner were called upon by a committee of the Senate to give evidence of the facts
on which ihe charge was made. They testih'ed that they knew nothing of the truth of
what the Examiner had published, but claimed that they had been informed of the
bribery by others. When asked the names of the informants they refused to give
them. Thus, these men who had made public a grave charge against members of the
State Legislature â a charge which had every aspect of a malicious slander â undertook
to defy the Senate and to put off the investigation with effrontery and impudence.
The Senate, acting in defense of its dignity as the highest legislative council of the
State, and far the purpose of obtaining evidence which would either expose bribe
takers or clear the honor of innocent men from the stain of a foil! slander, ordered
Lawrence and L vings sent to jail. From that order an appeal was taken. Both the
lower and the Supreme Court have sustained the Senate. As was said in the
decision of the Supreme Court, "It cannot be successfully contended, and has not been
seriously argued, that' the witnesses were juÂ«tified in refusing to give these names
upon the ground that tbe communication was privileged."
Thus by the Senate, by tho Superior Court of Sacramento County and by the Su
preme Court of California the Exaviiner, through its representatives, Lawrence and
Levings, stands convicted of publishing a maiclou3 lie for which it has no particle of
deiense to make. The only refuge to the slander-mongers is to assail the Supreme
Court. Their only force is malice. Their only weapons are lies. By these were they
brought into disrepute, and by them will they endeavor to smirch the reputation of the
men who have judged them and condemned them.
To Senator Morebouse, who has led the battle in defense of the honor of the
Senate and the good repute of the State, and to all who have aided him in his contest
with the slanderers, the thanks of the people are dne. Innocence is honored when
guilt is condemned, and every honest man in the State is benefited by the decision
which remands Long Green Lawrence to jail.
THE BOULEVARD.
The beginning of work.on the boulevard
is a gratifying accomplishment. Taking
all things into consideration, the work
may weil bÂ« accounted as one of more
than ordinary importance. It is an evi
dence, in the lirst place, that the people of
San Francisco are responsive to the needa
of their fellow-citizens who are out of em
ployment, and are willing to co-operaie
together to provide work for those who
need it. It is, moreover, a proof that we
have now attained a public spirit capable
cf undertaking large enterprises lor the
public good. Both of these things? are
gratifying in themselves and have in
them, moreover, the promise of greater
things to come.
The boulevard when completed will be
one of the finest driveways in America.
It will be a notable addition to the attrac
tions of San Francisco. It will open up
for residences one of the most picturesque
portions of the peninsuia, and will thereby
add materially to the wealth oi the com
munity. While in process ot construction
it will afford employment to a large num
ber of men at fair wages, and will there
fore be a means of providing comfort to
many a home which has been macie deso
late by the depression of hard times.
When the work thus undertaken has
been completed the people of San Fran
ci%co will have an object lesson in the
value of co-operative effort. They will see
before them a monument to public-spir
ited enterprise. They will have a contin
ual reminder of what can be accomplished
fur the sreaeral good when any consider
able number of citizens work together in
harmony ana unity. The result can
hardly fail to be the development of a
deeper and broader civic patriotism than
we have yet known, and out of the uootl
thus accomplished there will floÂ«v forth
results too great to be easily calculated.
We have started work on the boulevard.
Now let us get the Government to start
work on the Federal building.
THE DINGLEY TARIPF.
In introducing the tariff bill prepared
by the Ways and Means Committee Mr.
Dingley said:
The "bill as a whole has the unanimous
support of tne Republican members of
the Ways and Means Committee, and will,
it is hop.-d, receive the support not
only of Re-publicans but of others who
believe thm revenue should bÂ°> at least
equal to expenditures, with a small surplus
added, ana who are patriotic enough to enter
tain the conviction that in adjusting duties to
secure such revenue it is wise policy to en
courase home production and manufactures
and thus provide employment at good wages
for the laborers of our people, upjn whose
purchasing power depends the mtuket for our
productions.
That statement is about all the argu
ment needed for the new bill. The tariff
is devised for the purpose of raising addi
tional revenues for the Government and
of encouraging and promoting the indus
tries of the people of the United Stales.
It is clearly, therefore, a measure which
appeals to the patriotism as well as to the
economic sentiments of the people. It
has received as a whole the unanimous
support of the Republican memDersof the
Ways and Means Committee, and there
can be little question that it will obtain
from all Republicans a support almost
equally harmonious.
In the draft of the bill, as reported, tbe
time when tbe new tariff is to go into
effect is fixed for May 1. This is an earlier
date than was expected. The country
would be fairly well satisfied to see the
bill in operation by the beginning of the
new fiscal year on the Ist of July. The
more promptly the bill can be enacted,
however, the better the people will be
pleased, and there will be no little gratifi
cation if the House and the Senate act
with sufficient promptness to put it into
effect at the time desired by tbe Ways and
Means Committee.
That there are minor defects in the
measure goes without saying. A tariff
b.ll designed to achieve the double pur
pose of providing a revenue as well an pro
tecting industry must at times subordi
nate one of these aims to the other. Be
cause of the necessity of raising a revenue
absolute protection is not given to nil in
duslries, and because ot the necessity of
giving some protection where it is needed
the revenue to be raised by duties on
injrorts will not be as great as it might
have been. Looked at from either of these
points of view separately, the bill is sub
ject to criticism, but taken altogether it
is a measure which merits the support of
the people ana will undoubtedly be ac
cepted as fairly satisfactory.
The measure as a whole being in this
way sufficient lo the present needs of
the people, the oniy object now to be de
sired is its speedy passage and enactment
into law. All commercial and industrial
bodies should unite in urging Congress,
and particularly the Senate, to adopt the
bill without unnecessary delay. We have
waited a long time to see American mills
and industry once mora in operation. Tbe
unemployed call for work and wages. The
country needs the new measure at once.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1897.
THE CUBAN MASS-MEETING.
The meeting of the Cuban League at
California Hall on Monday evening, called
I for the purpose of receiving from the la
dies' auxiliary a banner of the Cuban Re
public, was a fitting preliminary to the
great mass-meeting of citizens which will
be held on Saturday evening at Metropol
itan Temple. It served to call public at
tention to the movement now under way
in this City and will have its effect in pro
moting the enthusiasm of the i>eople.
The object of the Cuban League is to
i advance the cause of the Cuban patriots
i and the establishment of the independ
j ence of the island as a free and sovereign
; republic. With that object the great mass
of the American peop c are in full sympa
thy, and if there were no other cause at
\ stake there would still be a hearty re
sponse to a mass-meeting called to give
encouragement and support to the league.
At the mass-meeting, however, there will
.be another cause as well as that of free
Cuba to be taken into consideration. It
is the cause of American citizens impris
oned without just cau^e. It is time the
American people nnd the American Gov
ernment began to act with more vigor for
the protection oi American residents
abroad. Ie is disgr&celul that this great
j Republic should De less careful of the
| rights of her people in foreign lands than
|is Great Britain. Tbe time has come
when the simple assertion, "I am an
Ameiican citizen," should be as complete
a protection in every foreign land as was
the saying in the ancient world, "lama
Roman."
The mnss-meeting to be held on Satur
day evening will serve the double purpo3e
of expressing popular sentiment in favor
oi free Cuba and the popular resolve that
America shall protect her citizens abroad.
The time is mo*t opportune for declaring
the will of the people on these subjects.
A new administration has come into pow
er, on which the people can rely fur t lie
adoption and enforcement of ft true Ameri
can policy. It is timely, therefore, for the
people to declare what they regard as true
Americanism, in order that Congress and
j the administration may tie made conscious
| that they will be supported by tue whole
| people if they put a summary end to the
i Spanish atrocities in Cuba.
THE ARBITRATION TREATY.
Unless something occurs to interfere
with the prearranged programme tbe Sen
ate while waiting for the tariff bill to be
adopted by the House will employ its
linft in discussing the proposed arbitra
tion treaty with Great Britain. This
treaty is now in the hands of tire Commit
tee on Foreign Relations and will proba
b'.y be reported as soon as the new Senate
is organized.
It is likely that the terms of the treaty
las reported from the omruittee will be
materially different from those which
were arranged by Secretary Olney. The
amendments will ba In the direction of
securing a greater freedom of action for
the United States than was permitted
under the Omey arrangement, and to that
extent will tend to make the measure
more popular with the people even if they
do not make it altogether satisfactory.
Among the proposed amendments is one
providing that every case or question in
tended to be submitted to arbitration
under the treaty shall tirst be submitted
to the Senate for its ratilication. This
change is in the highest decree important.
It will be remembered that the chief
objection made to the Olney treaty by
Senator Morgan was that it would place
all our dealings with Great Britain wholly
in the bands of the President, who under
the treaty could submit whatever question
he chose to arbitration without consulting
the Senate at all.
.If the President so cho^e he might sub
mit even such vital issues as those arising
under the Monroe doctrine or the control
of the Nicaragua canal to arbitrators with
out consulting the Banate. This would
have been subversive of the intent of the
constitution to eive the Senate equally
with tbe President control of our foreign
affairs and would have been a dangerous
power to intrust to a sinvle man no matter
how excellent he might be.
Another amendment proposes to change
the treaty so far as it requires Judges of
the United Stales Supreme Court to serve
as the representatives of this country on
the board of arbitration. It has been
pointed out that these Judges would
probably have to pass upon cases arising
under the treaty, and if they bad served
as arbitrators they would inevitably be
prejudiced and bound to render decisions
as Justices of the Supreme Court in ac
cordance with the arrangements they had
made as members of the board of arbitra
tion. The argument against this clause of
the treaty is so weighty that it can hardly
fail to determine tbe Senate to adopt the
proposed change.
Taken altogether it is probable that the
treaty, if adopted by the Senate, will be
radically different from that arranged by
Secretary Olney. It will be by no means
so complete a surrender of freedom of
action on the part of tbe United States.
It will make tbe Senate equally with tbe
President a party to all issues submitted
to the proposed arbitration. It will be,
therefore, a much better measure than
the one which now gives so much dissat
isfaction to ihe people. In tbe mean*
time it should be remembered it is aiso
quite possible that despite the proposed
amendments the Senate may reject the
treaty altogether.

DEGRADAiION Oi- THE
"NEW JOURNALISM."
Cleveland Leader.
Elbritige T. Gerry, the superintendent 01 the
New York Society for the Proven tion of Cruelty
lo Children, has just dealt the ''new journal
ism" a severe blow in a report on the increase,
ol crime among the youth of New York.
Mr. Gerry finds there are ninny causes for
juvenile criminality, but the most fruitful of
ail causes are the sensational newspapers
which are published in that cityâ papers which
seek to make vice attractive to the young and
ignorant by going into all the details of every
crime committed, and by picturing criminals
more or less in the light of heroes. He says he
is not mistaken, lor he has questioned many
juvenile offenders and has discovered that they
obtained most of their ideas from the sensa
tional newspapers, and he regards them as
much worse than the dime novels and other
flash literature.
Mr. (ierry could have had only two news
papers in mind, and those are the two expo
nents oi "new journalism" which are striving
for supeuiacv in their particular field. Their
Sunday editions are a disgrace to the journai
isiic profession, filled as they are with horri
ble pictures of every description, and it is a
serious question when the limit of indecency
will be reached by vhese unscrupulous pub
lishers.
ADVICE TO tFfiChoEEKERS
St.. Louis >-tar.
"Go home and wait," says President McKin
ley to the office-seekers.
Certainly this is good advice. Nothing is to
be gained by hanging around Washington. If
you have any claims on the administration
President McKinley has announced that he
will consider all applications In due time, and
wi.l try to give the offices to those who are
most entitled to them. And furthermore.be
states that the offices to be filled will be filled
by P.epublicans.
There are a whole lot of men in Washington
to-day who seem to think that they are espe
cially entitled to Federal positions because
some accident hns brought thtim into tempo
rary prominence. These are the most impor
tunate oi all office-seekers and make life a bur
den uoi only to the President, but to the mem
bers of his official farailv. It ispniDasJeas
much to get rid of this class a* for any other
reason that President McKiuley gave the ad
vice he did.
Outside ot some of the important appoint
ments President McKinley has stated that he
will do little before Mayâ and May is a long
wa , y *i?- n WO Â«1<1 seem, tht-refore, that all
this office-seeking outfit would see the wisdom
of following the President's advice.

Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest
Pawnbrokers' Charges.
To the Editor of the Ca'lâ Sir: Among the bills it is expected to rush through the Legislature
during the closing days of the present session is one designed to repeal that section of the
Penal Code which prohibits pawnbrokers from charging more than 2 per cent per monih
interest.
The business of pawnbroking has always been kept more or less under State surveillance.
and from the very nature of the case it is eminently proper that such should be the fact. It
has been so in California from the earliest times. In the so-called "flush" period these people
were allowed to charge but 4 per cent per montn, which rate was afterward reduced to the
present figure, 2 per cent.
Even under the present law the unfortunate pledgors, ignorant of its beneficial provisions,
are in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred forced to pay from 10 to 30 per cent a month. Suf
iice it to say that a provision that has been found necessary through all the prosperous years
of California's history to safeguard the unfortunate debtor, and the equivalent of which ia
found in the code of every civilized State, should not now be brushed aside in the obscure
hurry of the closing days of the session. We do not believe that such a bill could puss in the
face of ii full and fair discussion. Ii any measure ever deserved exposure and defeat this bill
clamors for such disposition. J. B. C.
A Fruit Restaurant.
To the Editor of the San Francisa Callâ Sir: May I .suggest, through your influential col
umns, to any enterprising capitalist who is looking around for a new investment that a fruit,
arinn restaurant might prove a profitable venture in a central city location this coming sum
mer. There are numbers of people nowadays who have found that the ordinary diet of
bread, mem and wg stables washed down with beer, wine or coffee, is one that cau be agree
ably and beneficially varied by an occasional change on fruitarian lines; while not a few have
been convinced both by the logic of the fruitarian school, and their own or friend's experi
ence that a constant resort to, and dependence upon "Natural Food" is the surest preservative
of, and guarantee for thai abounding health and vigor which every man and woman, if they
only knew what it meant to themselves, would place before every other Ambition.
Should this proposition not appeal with sufficient force to. the ordinary commercial-minded
capitalist, perhup9 a co-iperative joint-stock company might be formed to carry it out. com
posed of those who would guarantee their support to such an enterprise by their regular pat
rouage. I am, etc., William Mitchell.

EXPERIMENTING WITH
THE SUGAR BEET.
Washington Post.
Secretary Wilson has directed that the num
ber of five farmers be named ia every county
oi Missouri who are willing to plant sugar
beet seeds furnished by the Agricultural De
partment and at the end of the season forward
a portion of their crop to Washington for
chemical analysis and tests of saccharine qual
nv.
Secretary Wilson has contracted for 6000
tons of sugar beet seed since he lms been in
the department, and will make experiments
similar to that proposed for Missouri in every
county of fourteen States where the soil and
climate are suitable. Five iÃrmers in every
county will be asked to grow the stock and
the experiment stations in the several States
will be used as headquarters for directing the
work and making the chemical analysis.

"Down in the vicinity of Tupelo," said Pri
vate John Allen to a Washington Post man,
"some time during the summer of 1896 a
traveler on horseback espied a tow-headed,
bare-legged country youth of about 14, driving
a pair of billy-goats to a wagon ol home archi- j
tecture, on which rested a barrel of water. A
conversation ensued and the stranger ascer
tained that the lad hauled the fluid from a
river hard by his home to the paternal cabin
for use on washdays. He was further enlight
ened that the pay was sometimes as good as
15 cents a day.
â 'â Would you sell your goats, bub?' asked
the traveler.
"'I guess I would, miater, if somebody would
give me $2 for 'em,' replied the boy.
" 'Hold on down there,' shouted a native
who had just come up in time to near the con

The Barkentine Archer and the Schooner Jennie Wand, Two of the Vessels Which Arrived Oxf the Heads in the Midst of the Blow Yesterday,
A NORTHWESTER
CAUSES TROUBLE
Steamers and Sailing-
Ships From the South
Overdue.
The Pacific Mail Company's
Peru Was Looked for Sev
eral Days Ago.
Two Vessels From Hawaii and Sev
eral Coasters Were Ou side in
a Bunch Yesterday.
All classes of vessels bound north are
having an unusually bard time of it, and
a big fleet from Newcastle, N. S. W., Ha
waii and the Orient is now overdue. The
I Zealandia :s a fair example of what they
j have had to suffer, and she was two days
overdue owing to the heavy northwester
| that has prevailed for over two week.
At noou yesterday it was blowing forty
nine miles an hour at Point Reyes and
sixteen miles an hour at Point Lobos,
while at Â« p. m. it was blowing sixty-Tour
miles at the farmer place and iorty-eight ,
ai the latter, and still gathering in force.
Tiie sea was a very heavy one, and all the
vessels that made port had a very hard
time of it.
Steamers from the north came near
breaking tho record, and the State of Cali
fornia made the run from Astoria in thir
ty-seven hours, her own beÂ»t performance
being ihirty-six and a half hours. During
a very heavy norther three years ago,
however, the Columbia made the same
run in thirty-five hours.
On the other side of the case the Pacific
Mail Company's Peru from Hongkong via
Yokohama and Honolulu is now several
days behind time, and toe same com
pany's City of Sydney should have cot in
yesterday morning. On her way to Hong
kong the Peru lost a couple of the blades
of her propeller and trie reached her des
tination several days late. The damages
were repaired, but there may have been a
flaw in the ousting somewhere and the
propeller may have something to do with
the slow passage. In the case cf the City
of Sydney it is undoubtedly tun strong
head winds that are keeping her back.
She is not heavily laden ;md the north
wester would take a great hold on her.
Among the sailing vessels that got in
yesterday were the barkentine Archer I
from Honolulu in nineteen days and the
schooner Jennie Wand in an â¢ichteen
day trip from Kahului. The latter is
one or ihe best trips of the season, as the
R. P. Ritbet and Alden Besse are both out
twenty-five days from Honolulu, and the
crack brig J. D. Spreckels took almost
that time to get here from the islands.
The Archer and Wand were in company
with several ciaft of different description !
off tbe beans yesterday, and as the wind j
was fair they all sailed in, much to tbe !
discomfiture of the towboat captains.
Several other vessels were seen in the dis
tance, but when tbe gale began to increase
in fury they put about and made for the
open sea.
In the early morning a fleet of about
fifteen scow schooners started for points
on 'he Sacramento and San Joaquin r.vera.
They got as far as the Chickens all right,
but then the storm came down upon them
in force and all had to run for shelter un
der the lee of Portuguese Point. As at 3
p. m. tbe gale was still increasing Piper,
Anen, Goodall Company, several of whose
schooners are among the fleet, sent out a
tv- Â»ih provisions for the men and also
to render assis;ancÂ» if necessary. The cap
tain of the Shasta, who came down from
Pinole Point, said the schooners were all
riding easily, but that it would probably
be twenty-four hours before they would ba
able to resume their voyages.
Tbe shipping along the front was well
protected and no damage was done. It
was very rough on the bay, however, and
passengers by the various lerry steamers
did not enjoy Mie experience.

actress aereed to engage herself to him as

be awfully in earnest.
In order to preserve his rights the plain

A MAGNIFICENT ELK.
The State Board of Trade Ro n mi Â£n-
Hreued by a Siglclyou County
Exhibit.
Captain A. W. Brown, U. 8. A., was
busiiy engaged yesterday, with the assist
ance of C. M. Johnson, floor superintend
ent, in placing in position on the east side
of the State Board of Trade rooms on Post
street a collection of deer heads that will
add much to tha finished appearance of
the exh.bit.
Tbo central figure is the head and neck
of a majestic elk weighing 210 pounds.
When alive the animal must have
weighed between GOO and 700 pounds. It
was one of a band of seven imi fell by
Captain Brown's own hand. E les have
been hunted so persistently in biskiyou
County that they hate not been seen in
twenty years except now and then in
small bands.
Groupe i around the elk't bead are the
heads of twenty deer, all magnificent
bucks. One la what is called a "tighter,"
the prominent characteristic being a de
cided tendency toward a Roman nose.
On a sbelf under tne collection of deer
head- have been placed two large white
owls, killed near Crescent City last winter.
A flock of about 200 were driven down
from Alaska by the exceeding frigidity Of
that rigorous clime.
Three Japanese pheasants, one female
and two mules, placed under the owls,
add to the artistic appearance of the
exhibit.
Captain Brown has extensive copper
mines near lirants Pass, Oregon, and
some in Caliiornia near the boundary j
line. TheelK's and deer heads were in
tended <o adorn his own dining-room, but
he li n ally concluded to place them in
position at the State Board of Trn<ie
rooms to show what Siskiyou and Del
j Norte counties are in the way of a hunter's
paradise.
RAILWAY BONDS ARRIVE.
j They Are of the Valley Road, but Will
Not Uo Sold for Some Timeâ San
Kafael'a Petition. U:,t':ti
'dome of the first mortgage forty-four
! year gold bonds of the. San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railway arrived here
yesterday fresh from i the , presses in New
York, and the remainder will continue to
come till all are here.
The lot which arrived yesterday con
sisted of 250. There is nothing unusual
about them. They are much like mining
stock freshly issued and unsigned except
that they are In different shape. To each
bond, which bear the face value of $1000,
is attached the : coupons, each of which is
good for $25 interest every six months.
This is at the rate of 5 per cent a year.
It is believtd the bonds will bring con
siderably above par. However, Mr. Watt
said yesterday he had no idea when any
of the bonds would be placed on sale.
The road, he continued, was not ready for
it ana probably would not be for some
time. .
The directors of the road held their reg
ular meeting yesterday, but little was done
besides auditing several bills and transact
ing general routine business.
The directors of the Ban Francisco and
North Pacific Railroad also- met yester
day. One important matter before them
was the consideration of a petition from
San Ralael asking for lower fares.. The
matter was discussed and went over lor
thirty days.' Vice-President Foster said
several of the directors had not before
heard of the petition. They concluded to
take more time to look into it.
WOLPF INDICTED.
Several Matters Brought Before the
Grand Jury.
The Grand Jury yesterday returned an
indictment againit V. S. Wolff on the
charge of obtaining money under false
pretenses. Wolff had a number of sight
New York dralts cashed at the local banks.
Several witnesses were heard in an in
quiry concerning an alleged assault by
R. H. Patterson and Bern hard Ward,
which is alleged to have taken place in a
saloon kept by one McManus on Feb
ruary 12.
John Lynch was also heard in an allega
tion against Michael Costello, in which
Lynch charges Costello with the murder
| of his wife, who was the daughter ot
Lynch. Costello and his wife did not live
happily together. She died suddenly on
the morning of March 9, 1895. The cir
cumsiances were suspicious, and an in
quest was held and an autopsy performed.
Nothing was discovered that Mould war
rant a charge of murder. The physician
who was called immediately after the
death certified that the cause of deaih
was consumption. Costello is keeping a
store at the corner of Gilbert and Bran nan
streets.
Further testimony was also taken in
the Fair case. _

TO CELEBRATE
A SAINT'S DAY
Grand Programme of Ex
ercises in Honor of
St. Patrick.
Impressive Anaiversary Ser
vices at St. Patrick's Church
Last Night,
Entertainments Will Be Given at
Metropolitan Hall and Mechanics'
Paviliou.
Today being one of the greatest of all
Irish festivals will bo httimrly celebrated
in San Francisco by the Irish societies of
the City. The secular exercises wili in
clude a doable celebration, commencing
at 2 o'clock: at Metropolitan Hall and
closing at the Mechanic^ Pavilion with a
grand musical festival and promenade
concert. A choice literary and musical
programme hns been prepared for both
functions, special features of the celebra
tion at the Mechanics' Pavilion being the
display of stereopticon views of Irish and
American scenery and a grjyid chorus Oi
500 voices, the whole under the direction
of Alfred Roncovieri and John W. Me-
Kenzie.
The Knights of St. Patrick will hold
their twenty-second annual banquet me
! same evening at Delnionico's, the quests
I assembling at 8 o'clock. It pofs without
saying tha: the we'l-earnerl regulation of
that order for bounteous hospitality,
characteristic of ihe race, will be more
than sustained i>n tnat occasion.
The ceieuration of the twenty-fifth an
niversary of St. Patrick's churcn on Mis
sion street will be continued throughout
morning, afternoon and evening. The
fact that this anniversary fall 3on a dar
so auspicious in the Cutholic calendar
makes lheev?nt doubly interesting, and
it will be signalized by the assembling
from all parls of the State ol all the priests
w..0, dOrinj: the term of its existence,
have been pastors of St. Patrick's Church.
The special services yesterday were quite
as impressive as those of Monday last.
Tho huge and imposing interior of the
church was crowded from the altar rails
to the doorwny3 with earnest worshipers,
who f-rvently joined in the responses, and
listened attentively to tbe religious ex-
Donations of the orh'ciatin? priests.
The order of the service was as follows:
Recital of the rosary by Father Brennan,
during which the choir san^ tbe mysteries;
special prayers in honor ol H. Patrick ; sermon
by Father M. D. Connolly <<f St. Paul's; bene
diction of the blessed sacrnment, leather Cou
nolly officiating, a^slsttd by Father hrennan
and Father keane; blessing of objects of devo
tion by Father Brenuau.
Father Connelly preached an eloquent
sermon, with St. Matthew x as liii text,
in wii.cii the Savior counsels his apostles
piior to sending them forth on their mis
sion to tbe nations.
"I take this text," said the preacher,
"first because it conveys a solemn injunc
tion of the greatest importance to all who
would be followers of Christ, and sec
ondly because of the virtues which it In
culcates, namely, fearlessness with re
fp.'ct for men ana a salutary fear of God.
These virtues shine forth with a special
brilliancy in the light of him who is I ie
land'a apostle, the patron of her church,
whose feast we celebrate to-morrow. That
St. Patrick was an. mated by a great fear
of Ood is manifest from tho heroic au
sterity of his life, and the severe penances
to which he subjected himself. In carry
ing out his high mission he displayed the
greatest fearlessness towards men. His
courage and his manliness never failed
him when his duty to tho one true and
living God, whose minister he was, re
quired him to apeak openly against the
idolatrous customs of the people among
whom he preached.
"While aimiring the heroism of this
great apos Je of our race let us ask our
selves whether, in the profession of our
faith and the fulfillment of those duties
which that faith tmsils, we have been
moved by the spiritot Christian independ
ence which we so admire in the glorious
St. Patrick."
The preacher cautioned his hearers
against an attitude of a too ereat human
respect, pointing out that those who court
human approbation too frequently forieit
tho approoiuion of God. He denounced
the miserable cowardice which prompted
the renuncation of religious convictions
for fear of a smile or a jest, and referred
scathingly to the unfortunate being who
could not be witty witnoutobscenliy as "a
man who is doing all that in him lies to
bind the souls of his fellows to the chariot
wheels ol Satan."

BOTH EAGER FOR DIVORCE
Ernest Narpt and Wife's Dc
mestic Infelicity Reaches
a Climax.
She Claims That Her Husband Has
Persecuted Her, ani He That
His Wife Is Insane.
Last Wednesday Mrs. Ernest Narjot,
living at i\K Goiden Gate avenue, filed a
suit for uivorce acainst her husband,
E, nest Narjot Jr., the son of the artist,
and alleges In her complaint extreme
cruelty and failure to provide. She was
married to him about four months ago,
and they lived together scarcely two
months.
Mrs. Narjot is a woman about 30 years
of age, and the daushter of William Jack
son of R neon Hill. 6he possesses five
children by a former husband, John Dray,

here and San Jose, now dead.
Mrs. Narjot claims that when her has
band cot possession of all her ready cash,
aoine $500, and could not intimidate her
into procuring more be left her, and since
has threatened to prosecute her for open
ing his letters. She asks for no alimony.
Her eldest boy, aged 11, sells gum in the
Oberon.
Narjot resides at 138 a Fourth street, and
is the manufacturer of electric trusses. He
says his wife can have the divorce, pro
vided she asks for no alimony, and asserts
that she is mentally deranged.
"She is a Christian Scientist," he ex
plained, "and has lost her mind in study
ing it. I was afraid to live with her
longer.
"Since I separated from her she has
caused me much annoyance and financial
loss by having my letters sent her and
opening them. Many were from physi
cians who used to send me patients re
quiring electrical treatment. My wife di
vulged their names and the nature of
their ailments and the physicians nat
urally sent no more persons tome."

SINGER CHARLEY
TORE HIS HAIR
The Impresario's Anguish
Caused by an Attach
ment.
Bellet, Stage Manager of the
French Opera Company,
Sues His fctar.
Said to Be the Rfsult of a Misunder
standing â Property to Bj
R leascl T\.-Day.
Monsieur Charley tore his hair.
Attached! Disgraced! And by a man
he had thought his friend.
Perhaps there had been some mistake â
he would look again.
No, there was no mistake; he had been
sued and his beautiful costumes and stage
paraphernalia attached by Emiie Bellet.
There was the writ of attachment and the
gendarme who served it, and the ponder
ous Sheriff's lockâalas, it was too true.
Monsieur Charley tore his hair again,
for he is an impresario, and such actions
are a part of his dally or rather nightly
routine. The story of Monsieur Charley's
trouble is this:
When the French Opera Company, now
playing in this City and in which he is a
star, left Paris there was urgent need of
money âto be precise, 7000 francs âto get
tiie company to New Orleans. At first
there was some question as to where it
was to ba obtained, but Monsieur Charley
is a man of resources, and he soon nego
tiated a loan of the money from a Parisian
banking-house.
The bankers heard that the New Orleans
season bad been profitable, but the ex
pected draft did not materialize, and when
the company reached here the financiers
be?an to grow anxious.
EmiJe Bellet is the stage manager and
director of the company, and he was re
quested by the bank to jog M. Charley's
memory and take legal steps (o collect the
money if thm expedient failed.
Bellet at first demurred, for he was a
friend of the impressario, but be was
finally induced by the bank to act as its
asent. and when requests for liquidation
of the debt failed to bring results he sue<l.
Attorney Ruef drew up the papers, which
peremrtorily demanded the payment of
$141130, the American equivalent of 7000
francs, and âM. Charley tore his hair.
Attorney Ruef is authority for the state
ment that tlie matter hi been amicably
settled; that the whole affair was the re
sult of a misunderstanding, and that the
property attached will be released this
morning.
Last evening M. Charley had evidently
recovered from bid vexation of the morn
inc, for he sang his part in "Sigurd"
without the faintest suggestion that his
heart had been troubled by the sight of a
Sheriff's writ.

CHANGE OF VENUE
BILL IS PASSED
Senate Reconsiders Former
Action on Bridgford's
Measure.
Heated Discussion Precipitated
on the Flcor of the Upper
House.
Twenty-Six Mmb rs Vote "Aye,"
While Twe ye Are Opposed to
the Substitu c
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 16.âAn
o:her long and heated discussion was pre
cipitated in the S nate this afternoon on
Bridgiord's As-embly bill 977. the substi
tute for the Camiuetti bill 273. It had
onca been refused passage by the Senate,
but it was decided to give it a reconsidera
tion, and yesterday it was amended and
made a special order for 2 o'clock to-day.
TnÂ« section of the measure which has
caused more debate and more real sensa
tions than any bill before the present
session of the Legislature now reads as
follows:
Wnen it appears from the affidavit or affi
davits on fl'.e that either party cannot iiavea
i:i:r and impartial trial beiore any Judge of a
(ourt ot record about to try the cese
by reason ol tne prejudice or bias of such
j'jd::r, stiid Judge shau lorthwith secure the
nervices of some other Judge, of the same or
a-.ioilier county, to preside at the trial of said .
action or proceeding; provided, that in an ac- ]
no 1 ) in the Superior Court of h county, or of a j
city ami county, havm*; more than one aepart- |
meat, said actlm shall be transferred to an- |
other department thereoi, and tried therein j
In ;lie same manner as though originally as
signed to such department. The affi
daTit or affidavits alleging the disqua.i
ncation of a JuOge must be tiled and served
upon the ndverse par.y or the attorney for
such party at least one day before tne day set
for trial of such action or proc-edir.g; pro
vided counter affidavits may be tiled at least
one d iy thereafter or sucn iurthcr time as the
court may extend the time for filing such
counter affidavit?, not excetding five days,
and for this purpose the court may continue
the triai, and in no cause or proceeding c.tn
more than oil" such chance of Judges be had.
But the provisions ol this section shall not
apply to the arrangement of the calendar, or
to the regulation of tie order of business, nor
the power ci transferring the action or pro
ceeding to fort>e other court, or the hearing
upon such efli iavits a:id couuter affidavit*.
Senator Seaweil opened the debate by
saying:
"This bill has been the subject of mnch
feeling and contention. If I did not be
lieve that this was the best bill for the
purpose sought to be accomplished, I
would not urge it upon the Senate."
The privilege of peremptorily challeng
ing jurors was referred to, and the speaker
said that a sinsi ar right should exist in
reference to the Judge of the court, whose
] owers were far superior to those ol any
one jaror or an entire body of jurors. He
disclose 1 the amended bill at lenetti and
exhorted the Senate to pass the measure.
Senator Simpson advrried to his oppo
sition to the now notorious A-sembly oill
No. 273, and stated that he objected to
that me.isnre because he thought v needed
amendment. The bill now presented, he
paid, met wiih Ir.s approval and he in
tended to vote for it.
Senator Giiiette opposed the bill as un
necessary, and as Le:n{* a "slap" at the
emir* judiciary of the State.
Senator Bulia, who vo:ed for No. 273,
said he beiisved that the evils under the
proposed new and amended bill would be
greater tba:i the evils which the bill
sought to remedy, and that be would vote
against the measure.
Senator Withington spoke in f&vor of
the bill.
Senator Dickinson said be voted against
273 because there was no limit to the
number of times a change of ve:iue could
be taKen under it. He believed the
amended bill wai hi favor of a just and
fair litigation.
Senator Pealar spoke strongly in favor of
the measure, declaring that he did not con
sider it right for any one to vote for a law
simpiy because a corporation or a weal thy
individual might incidentally be bene
fited thereby.
Senator Wolfe supported the bill, and
on Stratton demanding the previous ques
tion, the roll was called and resulted in
i he passage of the measure by a vote of
26 ayes to 12 noes, as follows:
Androus, Beard, Bert. Boyce. Chapman,
Dickinson, Doty, Feeney, Franck, Gleaves,
Hall, II nderson, Langiord, Linder, Mahoney,
Pedlar, Frisk, ifeawen, Shine, Shippce, s-imp
eon. Smith, Toner. Voorheis, NNithiugton,

Aram, Braunhart, Bulla, Dwyer, Flint, Gil
lette, Hoilowuy, Jones, La Hue, Luchsinger,
Stratton, Troutâ total, 12 noes.
Denison refrained from voting, and
Llorehouse was absent in San Francisco
to represent the Senate id the contempt
matter bs:ore the Supreme Court.
The bill now toes to the Assembly for
concurrence in the amendments made by
tne Senate. It is understood that tne
amendments will be promptly approved
and then sent to the Governor, who has
already signinea his willingness to sign it.
BUDD MAY VÂ£TO THEM.
Doubt as to His Action on the
Dredger and Restralnlngf
{[ â 'â ; V Dam Bills '
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 16.â The
ten day-' limitation on the dredger bill
and the bill enabling the State to use the
joint Federal and State appropriation of
$500,000 for the construction of restrain-,
ing dams will expire to-morrow, and the
Governor will send a message upon his
'action with reference to the bills. The
enemies of the draper bill say to-night
that the Governor will veto it. Assembly
man Cutter rays that he will approve it
because, he paid to a Call reporter to
night,, the Governor was a man of his
word, and the Governor as good as told
him yesterday morning that he was going
to sign it. ; ' â  '
It is known, however, that the Gover
nor's brother, John E. Budd, is bitterly
opposed to 'he ! measure and has urged
him to place bis veto upon it. John
Budd's ; objections are principally that
there are anajts and gravel In the-, riv-ra
and (hat the lightning scoop-dredger will
be rendered almost useless by reason of
these obstructions. ' The dredger, worked
well enough in the Mississippi River,
argued John Budd, but it wouldn't work
in the Sacramento River.
'In the minds of the friends of the bill
the issue lies between me Governor's
word and the influence of the Governor's
brother. If the latter influence shall pre
vail and the Governor shall veto the bill,
it is .believed tnat the rumors of bribery
- afloat at the ; time -of the passage of the
bill will be used in justification 'of the
veto. But friends of tiie measure say tha
they have assurances from the executive
thai he will sign 1. 1> bill.
Tne Governor has assured Assembly
man -. ward : that 'â  he will sign the ' bit 1
bringing into operaiion the $500,000 appro
priation for the construction of restrain
ing dams. , .', . .
WOHK FOR THE IDLE.
Toland's Bill to Provide Labor for
the Poor Passes In the
Assembly.
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. March 16â If the
poor of California nad been present in the
Assembly tins afternoon and could bare
heard the eloquent and burning words,
the expressions of sympathy in their be
half from the lip* of Waymire, Dryden,
Emmons, Price, Dibble, Shanahan, Cana
van and Leavitt they would have shouted
for joy. But though the pleasure is de
nied them of be.ng present in the body,
they may read in The Call the glad tid
ings that the Assembly passed Toland's
bill (No. 285) allowing Supervi ors and
roadniasters to give every poor man a job
at three meals and 35 cents a day.
On behalf of tnÂ« bill Waymire and Dry
den stood arm in arm, while facing them
in opposition to the bill were Dbole and
Shanahan, cheet by jowl. The legislators
who favored the bill cried for the sorrows
of the ppor man even as the child cries
for purgatoria. Those who opposed the
bill took the raaged tramp to their warm,
palpitating bosoms and rained hot, briny
tears down his back.
Los Angeles, as generous with her gold
as her soil is with the succulent orange,
demanded in nickel accents that the hon
est tramp should be given ..is ooard and 35
cents per day, and the dishonest tramp in
jail his board and 10 cents per dayâ '.here
evidently being a 25-csnt margin between
vice and virtue. The supporters of the
bill argued that dumping gravel into
chuckholes on the county roads at 35 cents
per day would abolish poverty and pre
vent another French revolution.
Dibble denounced the bill as socialistic
and revolutionary and tearlully pleaded
that the poor man should not be cast into
slavery with all his sins on his head and
all his rags on his back, unshnven and
unshaved. The bill, in his opinion, rein
troduced the slavery of a century ago, with
its taskmasters and its scourges.
Sanaahan also moistened the rags of
the poor with Sbasta-water tears. The
bill, he said, would reduce the wages of
laborers* all over the State to 55 cents a
day ana board.
Bui thÂ« bill passed hy a vote o! 42 to 24,
and Leavitt gave notice of a motion to re
consider.
JM(K>CU WAS ABSENT.
JVo Action, Token by the Scandal Investi
gating Commute*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 16â The
Assembly committee to investigate the
French scandal held no meeting to-day on
account of the non-arrival of Mr. French.
The Sheriff at San Jose, to whom the
subpena for Mr. French had been issued,
telegraphed to Cnairmnn Price thai Mr.
French was in San Francisco and a
subpena was sent thither, but no reply
had been received up to a late hour to
night. The committee will hold its rinal
meeting to-morrow and will report that
no blame is attached to any of the at
taches of the Assembly.
LATE TRAINS FOR SAN RAFAEL
Petitions Asking the North Pacific Coast
Railroad to Be.ter /ts
Service.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 16â The
T>eoj>le of M rin County are ab><ut to peti
tion the North Pacitic Coast road to run a
night train from San'Rafael and Mill Val
ley to San Francisco, to leave those towns
about 10 o'clock and to arrive in San Fran
cisco at about 11 o'clock.
The petitions are to be circulated in
every town on the line of the railroad be
tween San Rafael and Sausalito and also
on the Mi.l Valley branch. The petitions
are being prepared and will be put in cir
culation to-morrow.
Wui-e the North Pacific Coast Railroad
runs a boat to Mann County, leaving San
Francisco at 11:30 p. >i., it has nevet at
tempted to run a boat leaving this side
late in the evening except on special oc
casions.
The most prominent men in Marin
County are nutting thu petition forward,
and it was not agreed to take action until
the opinions of a laree number of citizens
in favor of it were obtained. The petition
I asks that the boat be rnn at least once a
i week, on either Wednesday or Thursday
| night.
'â¢T c summer timetable of the North
Pacific Coast road will be issued in a short
| time," said one of the leaders in tbe move
i ment in discussing the proposition to-day,
I "and as the railroad runs a boat on
I Wednesday nights from San Francisco at !
! a late hour it would be but a trifling ex
' psnse to make an extra trip, leaving the J
i Marin side at an hour that would allow â¢
j peop c to visit friends across the bay and j
â¢ return to their homes in Ean Francisco
j the evening.
"The petition which we will circulate
' for signatures to-morrow has the approval
of the improvement club members in the
various towns %nd other citizens, among
whom are Sidney B. Cusbine, Judge j
Thomas Foltreil and Commodore C. H. i
Harrison. "We believe the railroad wil. j
grant this request, for their summertime- i
table ?s always excellent and the running I
of this train will add greatly to tbe
travel."
Following is the petition that will be
j circulated:
! J. B. Stetson, Prttident North Pacific Coast
j Ra. lroad â Dear fciK: We, the undersigned
J residents and propurty-owuers living in Mill
Valley and vicinity, appreciating the good
j service you have rendered us in the past, and
I especially during; last mmmtr, respectfully
1 petition that, if it is possible, you will make
'â¢ p.n evening trip to San Francisco, leaving Mill
j Valley somewhere in the neighborhood of 10
o'clock.
If you find it Is Impossible to run more than
: once a week we wouid suggest that the trip he
! made on Wednesday or Thursday nights. We
| feel that the trip would pay the railroad, be
sides adding to the social attractions of this
bi'Je oi the bay.

MENDOCINO ASYLUM CASE.
Dr. Martin, on Inmate, Claim* That He Is
Not Insane, but Has Been Cruel//
Wronged.
URIAH, Cal., March 16.â Dr. Arthur
Martin, who has acquired more or less
notoriety in Kan Francisco during: the
past three years owing to his matri
monial experiences with one Alma Jos
selyn, was to-day brou lit before Judge
Mannor of the Superior Court of this
county by Dr. E. W. Kinj, medical super
intendent of the Mcndocino asylum.
Martin had prjyed .'or the issuance of
habeas cornus, which petition was granted
I ana the writ made returnable at 10 o'clock
to-day. In his own|behalf Dr. Martin re
lated his troubles of the past three years,
arguing that an attempt had been made
to separate himself and his wile by vari
ous schemes, which he alleged were per
petuated by Secretary Holbrook of the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Soriety of San Fran
ciico and General W. H. L. Barnes, whom
he bad retained as counsel in the litiga
tion between his wife and her grand
father, George Staacke.
His statement wns made in the presence
of the court and officers thereof, mid sev
eral reporters, ana showed a thorough
knowled c on the part of the man ot botli
legal and medical experience. He state!
that he was a irraiiuateof the Homeo
pathic College of Medicine at BHlumore,
and of the Homeopathic College at Vien
na, Austria. His story ol his alle.ea
wrongs was exceeding interesting, and,
if true, would show that the man was
greatly wronged ; but these were declared
by Dr. E. W. King to be t:.Â« delusions of
a diseased mind. .
Martin says that he doeÂ« not know the
present whereabouts of his wife, nor of iiis
two children, and makes all manner of
arave charges against General Barnes, and
Rlleges that lie will bring disbarment
proceedings agninst that gentleman. Mar
tin was committed to this asylum on the
4th inst. by Judge Belcher, but stated that
he had no hearing in court and his com
mitment was brought about by fraud.
Drs J. C. Maddux, W. N. Moore and J.
L. Bond were present as experts, and
after hearing the matter Judge Mannnn
remanded Manning to tbe custody of Dr.
King.
FRESNO LABORER'S AWFUL DEATH
Becomes Entangled in a Lasso Thrown
Over a Mule and ts Dragged
for Hours.
FRESNO, Cal.. March 16.â William R.
Miller, a farmhand, met with an awful
death yesterday afternoon at the Bonni
fieid ranch, sixteen miles east of this city.
While lassoing mules he became en
tangled in a rope attached to a wild
animal. The mule ran and dragged him
for several hours, until it completely ex
hausted iuelf. The unfortunate man's
body was horribly mangled.
Miller went out wiih his brother-in-law,
Nathan Higgins, to catch a number of
mules which were grazing in a pasture.
The animals were all very wild, and con
siderable difficulty was experienced in
rounding them np. Miller succeeded in
throwing his lasso over the head of one of
the mules, but it made a lunge and jerked
the rope from his grasp. Then the two
men set about to get hold of tne trailing
rope again. The mule ran around in mad
career, and finally Higfiins gained a posi
tion immediately in front of the animal.
The n.ule was running with such speel
that, when the man appeared in front of
it and suddenly checked its course, it
reared on its hind le.s and made a vio
lent turn to one side.
In doing so it sent the rope, which was
trailing behind it, twirling in the air. A*
the end of the lasso descended Miller,
who was directly under it, reached up to
catch it. His luni missed it and the rope
twirled around bis arm. It tied itself in a
very peculiar manner into a hitcu, se
curely fastening the unfortunate laborer's
arm. In an instant the mule had resumed
its wild race around the pasture, dragging
Mill-r at the end of the rope. The animal
then jumped the fence, and the man's
bo<iy struck this with terrible fdrco.
Higgins mounted a horse and pave pur
suit, in tbe hope of slopping the runaway.
For several hours he followed and tried to
head off the wild animal, but could do no
more than change its course. Higgins'
horse gave out and he had to give ud tne
cnase. Tht* mule did not stop until it was
sta gering, and then Miller's body was
freed.
Miller was 24 years of age. His mother
1 yes at his brother-in-law's, where he Had
been working.

' The little Sarsaparill a birds bring joy to mother's boys. They will bring real lasting joy to you
too. Gentle reader, this is the time of the year when every one needs a good blood y medicine. The
reason being that the blood is sluggish and thick, the liver and kidneys are inactive and the stomach
needs tone. You will find many good and many bad " Spring Remedies " in the drugstores, but you
will find none so good as Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Other people say so because other people know
so. Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is nature's true remedy. In the first place it is a gentle laxative. You
don't : need nasty pills. Yes, Joy's is a laxative that loosens the v bowels in that slow, gradual I manner "
so as to cause no uneasiness, no gripes, no sick stomachs. In the second place, Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla; will . drive the impurities of the blood through nature's natural channels, so you won't have
skin spots, face sores, sarsaparilla sores, when you take Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparil'la. It is the modern
medicine. It is good for the ills of Spring. - ; '-â ;'.
'[' It is the open boast of ; some druggists that they can always " substitute " when a lady inquires
for a remedy. Don't let them do it. When you ask for Joy's get Joy's, and nothing else. â¢; ;
TWO MURDERERS
CONFESS GUILT
Story of the Killing of
Serafino Genignani Is
Told.
An Indian and a Ha! '-Breed
Committed the Horrible
Crime.
Dragged Their Helpless Victim From
His Bei by His Whisk rs and
Butchered Him.
KEDDING, Cal.. March 16.â The pre
liminary examination of William Miller
and Louis Richards, charged with tho
murder of Serafino Genignani at New
town last week, was held in Judge Gar
den's court here to-day.
The defendants, one of- whom is a full
blooded Indian and the other a half-breed
Indian, appeared without counsel and
conducted their own defense.
The witnesses examined were chiefly
Indians, but all the testimony was decid
edly against the defendants and pointed
directly to their guilt. Clothing which
they wore on the day of the murder,
found in their cabin and in different por
tions of their dooryard, covered with
blood, was identified by several of the
witnesses. The knife found at the scene
of the cutting was identified as belonging
to Miller; the shoea worn by them pre
vious to the murder were found to fit ex
actly the tracKs found around the body
and leading to the house of Genignani.
At the close ot the examination Judge
Garden held the defendants to appear
before the Superior Court on a charge of
murder.
After the examination was ovar and the
prisoners locked in their celts Ricnarrii, the
Indian, called for the District Attorney
and to him made a clean confession of the
entire affair.
The facts as stated by Richards are as
follows:
On the day of the murder Richards and
Miller hud been drinking and about 6
o'clock applied at Genignani's cabin for
aomft wine, which he relused them. They
left the place and went to Newtown, where
they took several more drinks. They
returned to Genignani's cabin at about 8
o'clock. Genignani was lying on his bed
as eep. The men broke into his cabin,
caught Genignani by the beard and pulled
him from the bed. In doing this they
pulled a greater portio:i of his beard out
by the roots. Genignnni attempted to d -
fend himself, but had no weapon. He
fought ti.em as best be could and en
deavored to get away. They felled him
to the floor with :â  blow on the head and
robbed him of $33. They then grabbed
him by the hair an i whiskers and pulled
him from the house about twenty steps.
He again struggled to escape, when Miher
pulled out a large pocket-knife and
stabbed the poor victim in the throat just
above the breastbone.
They dragged him a few steps farther,
where they cut his throat and cut a large
gash in the back of his head. They then
dragged him farther with the intention
of Incline the body in a reservoir. A
picket fence was in their way and they
there left the body.
The murderers then took from Genig
nani's pockets what trinketsand valuables
that were in them and went back to his
house, ransacked it, and then br ke into
the wineiiuu.se and stole a large quantity
of wine and left ten casks of wine flowing
to the floor. They then changed their
clothes, hid a par: of the bloody clothing
ai.cl buried the remainder, and hid the
monoy and trinkets stolen from their
v ctim.
The fiends then went to Miller's cabin,
where they were arrested.
Richards states thai Mil!er did the kill
ing, while he helped drug the body to
wnere it was found. He told the District
Attorney where the hidden money and
trinkets cou d be found, and made a clean
breast of the whole affair.
A good deal of indignation is fe't here
to-mgnt over the affair and there is strong
talk of lynching.
Miller is an intelligent half-breed and
r<*ads and writes the English language
fluently. He is a mean-looking fellow
and bears ail the marks of a bad man.

from his ; home a wee* , ago Friday. No
trace of the missing man has been found.
'The road he took from his home for

It is thought he became froz n and blinded

these fathomless depths. . .
Mr. Roberts' was; recognized as one of
the ablest political writers : in Northern
California and the last' article from his

last Thursday. A Btrange coincidence,
taken with the supposition that. he : fell

Joseph Kerr, a Respected Rancher Living
Near Paso Robles, Suddenly Goes
W.idiy Insane.
PASO ROBLES, Cal., March 3.âJo
seph Kerr, a highly respected rancher,
who lives a mile and a half northwest of
here, went violently insane to-day. It
took the united efforts of five men to sub
due and bind him.
Kerr was lound in the hills back of his
home by Constable "Â¥. B. Saunders. Ha
made a desperate attack on the constable
with a large knife, and Saunders, who is
a iarge and powerful man, was like a
mere child in the bands of the madman.
If assistance had not been at han't it
would have fared badly with the officer.
Sauuders beat his handcuffs hard enough
to break t: em over the head of K?rr i.e
fore the maniac could be subdued. Finally
he was bound and brought into town.
Kerr has always been a hard-working
and industrious man, and no reason can
be assigned for his sudden madness. He
has a wile and two small children. They

One Great Object of Tbis Work Now
Is to Get the Churches on a
Higher Plane
Ira D. Sanfcey, the famous singing evan
geiist, author of "The Nine. y and Nine,"
and other religious songs that Bre heaid
in the various languages of the world, ar
rived here yesterday. Mr. Moody did not
come with him, but Mr*. Sankey did ;*also
Mr. and Mr*. J. E. Sankey of Brooklyn.
The evangelist is loosing very much as
he did when last here. His health seems
good and his spirits are lively. He said
he was feeliug very well indeed, but that
Mrs. Sankey needed the California air
once more, and he decided to bring her
here.
"We left New York on February I to
come here for the benefit of her health,"
he said, "and on the way held meetings
at Buffalo, St. Louis, El Paso an i Red-
Jands. lamto be here till April 8, when
we will go to Portland, Tacoma, Seattle
and Spokane, and we wili probably hold
meetings in all these. Then we will go
Home by the Northern Pacific.
''Meantime I will remain here and will
conduct the singing here for the State
Sunday-school convention, which meets
on April 6, 7 and 8. Besides this I may in
a few days hold some meetings iv this
City.
"The meetings I have recently held have
not been evangelistic as such, but are a
service of song and story. Tbis is my va
cation time and I want to muke its work
as light as I can consistent with the good
to De attained.
"So 1 sing some of my songs that are
dow pretty weil known throughout the
globe and tell how I came to write tuetu â
that is. what led to it and the circum
stances surrounding each case, in this
way 1 1 ink I have been able to do a great
deal.
"Neither Mr. Moody nor myself has been
speaking u> the masses as much as for- j
merly. Our work has been in the church, i
It baa been with the object of arousing the
people there to action and having them go
forward and bring in the people. We find
it worts well.
"We say to them, 'You know it is true;
now go out and do thi work.' Ourt-fforts
have been to get the churches themselves
on a hguer plane.
"And in regari to the Christian religion
in tbe East and elsewhere where I have
been I can s. v that it is developing and
taking a very iJrm hold on the people. I
have just been holding meetings for four
mont * recently in New York, in Car
negie Hall, w here the attendance and in
terest was something remarkable. I have
never seen greater interest than was mani
fested at tue-e meetings.
"The Christian faith is certainly taking
a deeper hold on the people of the coun
try than ever. My particular object is
now to get ttie churches aroused to doing
their whole duty. They have all the
means, and all it requires js tbe firm be
lief that always brmgs the' Christian's re

upon.
They at first thought of making lint and
bandages to forward to Cuba, but the dif
ficulty of landing such articles on the
island was suggested and the scheme
abandoned.
They are now working on a plan for giv
ing a series of entertainments, by which
;hey hope to accumulate a substantial
sum to buy nv-dic ties and arms. The
league itÂ«elf will begin wotking toward
the same object as soon as the mass-meet

A WORD FROM .SILEB .
UNO THEY'LL FIGHT
Continued from Fifth rage.
to the springs was Lia Fuller, whose sis
ter La Loie, is an old friend of the Cali
foruian. Billy Woods and Jeffries were
about as contented a looking pair as coulii
be found in the vicinity to-day, since they
had a rest from Jim's mauiing apparatus.
M, Vey also wore a jaunty smile, which
wes absent during the days when his head
was battered against the wooien wails of
the gymnasium. Later in the afternoon
Jim went for a short walk and came home
with a series of smiles and sprints.
At Cook's rancn Hickey and Stelzner
had time to compare notes on past injur
ies, as they were not asKe.l to put on the
gloves. Roeber, however, had to push
and shove for a few minutes while the
champion tried out his wind. Bob then
took a turn at the bag and sprinted round
the yard a few times. A little roaa work
wound up the proceeding.
Both pugilists turned in early to get a
gocd long rest before the eventful hour.
According to to-night's arrangements Cor
bett will perhaps take a short walk in the
morning and then drive to the arena. Of
course the weather will have a great deal
to do with the plans of both men.
Professor Walter Watson of the Olympic
Club, San Francisco, who is credited with
having brought out Corbett's boxing abili
ties, was probably the most welcome vis
itor at the Californian's quarters to-day.
He comes as a special writer for The
Call.
"Come iri and take a flash at me, Wal
ter," said Jim afti r a handshake. "Your
opinion oupht to Bettie the question of
my condition."
Watson followed the champion's father,
P. J. Corbett, into Jim's cottage, where
the examination took place. Jim stripred
to the waist and Watson thumped him
and kneaded every muscle in his trunk.
Corbett senior adjusted his spectacles and
watched the process.
"You are down pretty fine, Jim, pretty
fine," said Watson. "Not too fine, under
stand me; just about ri^ht, I should think.
I never saw your muscles so hard. They
show through the skin more than ever be
fore. Perhaps that is why you appear to
be drawn down so much. Your neck is
bigger than it used to be, I think. Have
you been saving your right? Your left
seems to be bigger than I ever saw it. If
you were a stranger I should say you in
tended to fight this battle with one hand.
i Your right shouMer muso'es strike me as
having just about the proper develop
ment. Perhaps I shouldn't be too criti
cal, but I know yon take some stock in
what I'm saying. You are harder than
you were in former years and carry less
beef on you. I should say that you were
in absolutely perfect condition for a man
of your ace and development. The more
I look et you the better I like your appear
ance. If, as you claim, yonr bellows are
all right the championship will stay in
San Francisco."
Jim's father had not much to Â«ay.
"J;m seems to have muscles st'eking out
all over him," was the old gentleman'
comment. "His face ain't so very thin.
His si-oulders look very big to me. Come
to think of it I never saw them look so
large. Now, so far as his color goes, I
want to tell you right now that he never
looked better. Those lines about the eyes
are perfectly natural. I had them when I
was his age. Jim ani Joe taKe after me,
you know. I am satisfied with the lad's
appearance, and if he don't win â well, he
shouldn't have any excuse to offer the
folks at home."
Jack McAuliffe, the ex-lightweight
champion, attracted a little attention on
Carson street this afternoon.
"I have not seen cither of the big fel
lows stripped," said Jack to a crowd in
front of Stuart's office. "You can't tell a
zreat deal by a man's face and not much
more by seeing him stripped, but accord
ing to my notion noth Jim and Bob are
'tiner than silk.' Why shouldn't they be?
I think the pace will be so hot that the
fight will not last more than six rounds.
Judging by their talk to me they ain't
going to do much dancing about and
drawing out. This fisht is for blood, and
it will be all over by 11 o'clock to-moriow
if the sun shines."
Wyatt S. Earp, who refereed the
Sbarkey-Fiizsimmons contest, sized up
the heavy-weights this morning. Earp is
a secretive man naturally, and he had not
much to say when he came back from
Shaw's Springs.
"I thought Corbett might not be as
good as he was represented," he drawled.
"He looks migh y determined, though,
and I don't believe he is afraid of an ana
conda. Fitzsimmons ain't as heavy as
when he foucrht Sharkey. Maybe be is
worrying. The man with the most nerve
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. MARCH 17, 1897.
is going to win this fight. Both of them
aie well fixed for that article to-day."
If expert opinion counts for anything
the battle will bÂ» a very short one. A
few guesses as to the number of rounds
follow:
W. A. Bradyâ Not less than four and not
more than eight ror.nds.
Martin Julianâ Fi zsimmons will knock
Corbeit's head oft befcre the sixth round
is over.
Billy Delaneyâ l look for a fast fight.
Corbett will get Fiiz's measure in two or
three rounds. There is too much at stake
for eiiher man to run any risk by ruahing.
Ten rounds ought jo decide matters.
Ernest Roeberâ lf the morning is cold
they will fight fast. Fitz will get his work
in about the fifth round. I think Corbett
will get rattled and run into a knockout
about that time.
Charley Whiteâ lt will be the fastest
fieht between heavy-weights in the h s
tory of pugilism. Corbett wiil fool them
on his punching power. Six or eight
rounds will see the last of Fiizsimmons.
Dan Hickey â The man who gets the
first punch in will likely v"n. Fitz will
be cooler then Corbett, and if Jim forces
matters Bob will get to his jaw before sev
en rounds are over.
Billy Woodsâ Fitz will never put a
glove on Corb3tt. If he can stand up be
fore Jim for three rounds he is a better
man than he was when I sparred with
him.
Jack Stelzner â Corbett will lose his head
when he finds that Bob can hit him, and
Bob will knocK him out inside of four
rounds.
William Muldoonâ The two men are in
such perfect condition that I hardly think
the tight will last more than thirty min
utes.
Jack McAnliffeâ lt is a erndge fight,
and no time will be wasted. The man who
keeps his head will win in short order.
Tom Shark-y â The kinetescope people
won't need much tape for this fight. The
men will go at each other like tigers, anil
it will be all over in less than twenty min
utes.
Billy Maddenâ "We will never live to Â»cc
such a fact light between two big men.
They have old scores to settle, and it won't
take them Jong to do it.
Al Smith â I don't think it will be a very
long fight. Corbett usuiilly trims his man
in short order, understand me, and
Fitz doesn't lose much time, either. We
won't have to wait lone for the finish.
Jimmy Wakeleyâ Six rounds will tell
the tale, if I am a judge. These fellows
have plenty of speed, and there won't be
any fooling on either side.
Notwithstanding these predictions the
talent is buying pools on rounds ten to
fifteen.
"Whera are all these people going to
sleep?" asked a tall Englishman who had
traveled all the way from London to see
the fiÂ«ht. His query raised a point which
had not been sufficiently considered be
fore. Every lodging-house and private
residence is crowded, and still the visitors

to dry footing, as they were the last on
deck.
There was considerable delay in getting
the battle on account of a scarcity of
boxing-gloves. Corbett had retained pos
session of his mittens after the inter
rupted fight of a week before, bnt the
Ghoynski laction had allowed Joe's sieves
to be cared for by a friend who failed to
reach the place of battle. Corbett, to ex
pedite matters, said that he would use
his two-ounce gloves and that Choynski
could don any of the several pairs of
driving-gloves which were in tlie posses
sion of the sports. Choynski finally
selected a pair of mitts that happened to
tit him nicely and the battle was soon de
clared.
Corbett started into the engagement
with a crippled right hand, which was
sore from his fight In Marin County. In
the fourth round be broke the third
knuckle ot bis left hand, but he remained
on deck and foueht right along to a finish.
Choynski was coached by Jack Dcmpsey
and Corbett had Billy Delany as bis prin
cipal second and adviser. Demptey read
Joe quite a lecture before the contest and
admonished him to stay away from Cor
bett, otherwise he would leave him to
look out for himself. Choynski listened
implicitly to the then great ricg general,
and, acting under instructions, he re
ceived a terrible face-punching. Corbett,
who is a long-range tighter, jabbed Choyn
ski with his leit until the receiver could
hardly see his opponent.
In sheer desperation toward the close of
the tight Eddie Graney instructed Choyn
ski, contrary to Dempsey's wishes, to get
in close and mix it up with Corbett, and
he sailed in and slogged with right and
left. Corbett appeared for the first time
at a disadvanta c, but Choynski had com
menced his new style of fighting too late
in the game. He was extremely weak
from loss of blood and the exertion of a
hot rush winded him. There were many
of the spectators who said that if Choyn
ski had cut out his own style of ii hi ing
and had some other second besides Demp
sey the result would have been different.
After the battle, which lasted twenty
seven rounds, Corbett's wounds consisted
oi two maimed hands, a black eye, swollen
lips and a lump on his forehead.
Choynski's face looked fearful. It was a
mass of cuts, bruises and discolorations,
with both eyes in mourning.
Corbett's next contest of any note was a
six-round bout against Jake Kilrain in
New Orleans on February 18, 1890. Corbett
"smothered" Kilrain, and was givon the
decision. But his next battle, winch was
the hardest of all, took place In the old
California Club against Peter Jackson, the
colored heavy-weight champion of Aus
tralia.
The contest was declared a draw at the
end of the sixty-first round. Both men
manifested .such marked cleverness that
heavy blows were out of the quest .on, and
The Soft Glow of the Tea Rose

that was why the battle went on to such
a length.
The sports said after the fight that
Jackson was gone and that he had lost his
hitting powers, because he was unable to
conquer Corbett, but the great colored
fighter exploded that opinion when be
met the then great slogger of the day,
Frank P. Slavin, in England, and on the
evening of March 30, 1892, Slavin was
whipped to a finish and was knocked oat
in the tenth ronnd.

SHARKEY
SAYS HE
WON'T PAY
Takes High Moral Grounds
Against Trainer Allen's
Bill.
HIS CONTRACT AGAINST
PUBLIC POLICY.
Work Done in Furtherance of a
Prize-Fight Not a Legal
Basis for a Suit.
CIVIC FEDERATION IS GIVEN
A WEAPON.
Opponents of Boxing Matches In
formed That Such Contests
Are Feionions.
Easiness men and dealers in general
will fina it necessary to use great caution
in their transactions with prize-fighters if
the theories of Thomas Sharkey are sus
tained in the courts.
Trainers of pugilists will also find it
essential to arrange for the collection of
their wages in advance, lest the lighters
to whom they give instruction may grow
bo virtuous after victory that they will not
feel disposed to fulfill the requirements of
a contract that is contrary to public
policy, illegal and, consequently, not
binding.
From a sporting viewpoint this attitude
assumed by Mr. Sharkey is most im
portant. It has put a weapon in the
bands of those who are opposed to boxing
matches, for if Mr. Sharkey says his con
test with Mr. Fitzsimmons was a prize
light and, consequently, a felony, or, to
say ibe least,- an infraction of the peace
and unlawful, then those who are opposed
to fistic encounters are justified in appeal
ing to the law for the suppression of such
exhibitions.
If the members of the Civic Federation
or others interested in such matters care
to take the question to the courts they
have but to copy the brief tiled by Mr.
Sharkey. in which he solemnly declares
that such boxing affairs are illegal, and
t tie arm of the law will be stretched forth
to end them. This will be a result neither
looked for nor appreciated by the promot
ers of pugilistic encounters.
Some time .ago J. J. Raver, assignee lor
George Allen, sued Sharkey lor $500 on
account of Allen's services in training
Mr. Sbarkey for his boxing-clove contro
versy with Robert Fitzsimmons in a cer
tain 24- foot ring in this City.
Herein restea a dangerous element, for
Mr. Sharkey, througn his counsel, W. H.
L. Barnes has taken the high moral
ground that the contract under which the
services were rendered was in itself a con
tract, "contrary to common decency, pub
lic morality and the law." For this rea
son the defendant asks that judgment be
given in favor of himself and against the
plaintiff on the pleading.?. The alleged
services as specified in the complaint are
as tollows:
That within two years last past at the City
Â«id County of Han Francisco one George Alleu
performed work and labor and rendered ser
vices in and aDout the training ana prepara
tion of the defendant Thomas sharkey lor his
fistic encounter with one K. Fitzsimmons.
Mr. Sharkey's lawyer proceeding on the
lines laid down says:
We contend that It appears from the com
plaint that the services rendered were in the
training of the said defendant for a prize-fight j
and comes within the provisions of the act of |
March !>. 1893, prohibitory of prize-fighting I
and making me same a felony.
Mr. Sharkey then quotes from the Cen
tury dictionary to snow that a fistic en
counter is a prize-fight and that a prize
light is a fistic encounter.
.From the same source it was learned
that a fight means to engage in battle or
single combat, to attempt to subdue or
destroy an adversary by physical means,
bo that in fact, Mr. Sharkey avers, the
complaint attirmativelv alleees a fight
"whereby bruising or maiming or other
serious bodily curt may result to the
participants."
Mr. Sharkey in further opposition to the
payment of Mr. Allen's Dill sets forth the
folio wine argument:
A further element of prize-fighting Is set
forth in the complaint in tbe allegation that
plaintiff's assignor trained defendant. It is a
matter of common knowledge that training is
a matter antecedent to a pnze-flclu and pre
paratory theretor, and the court may so con
sider such matters; as it was said in the case
oi Seville vs. the State, reported in 30 N. E.
.Reporter, 624, as follows:
The question (What is a. prize-fight?) is not one
of skill or science, to be decided upon the opinion
of those ezperieuced in sucli practices, or by rules
adopted for tbe government of associations of said
pers jus, but one within the comprehension ot the
common unders. sliding and the range of common
knowledge.
â¢ Mr. Sharfcey's protest against the liqui
dation cf the debt adds:
Conceding for the purposes of argument that
the "fistic encounter" for which plaintiff's
assignor trained the defendant, Sharkey, was
not a prize-fight. H must have been n case of
battery, as is shown by section 242 of the
Penal Code. The note to that section is in
these words: "Where two persons mutually
fight by agreement each is equally guilty of a
several and distinct offense."
Again, 11 the "fistic encounter" alleged is
not a prize-fight, but en ordinary ngnt, doeti
that fact make it any more decent, moral or
lawful?
Following that pointed question Mr.
Sharkey sets forth the several grounds of
public policy, morality and decency
whereby such a contract would be void,
and incidentally leads tne court to infer
that it would not be right to pay the bill,
even if he should wish to do so. He re
gretfully says:
Objection to a recovery cannot be obviated
or waived by any system of pleadings, or even
by the express stipulation oi the parties. The
court itself is bound to raise objection to the
proceedings in the interest of the administra
tion of justice and will not listen to claims
founded on such services as those alleged to
have been rendered in this case.
To establish this principle Mr. Sharkey
cites the learned opinion of the United
States District Court of NÂ°w Jersey, where
Oscanyon sued the New York Arms Com
pany for commissions on certain arms un
lawiuliy sold to the Ottoman Government,
whereupon Mr. Sharkey solemnly com
ments:
If the court condemns such a contract as the
one embraced in the case quoted, how much
stronger the case at bar appeals to the court
forcondemnatlon. If such a contract is de
. clared to be contrary to public mornlitv a
fortiori, so should a contract bo decinrcd that
has for its objee. the teaching or training and
educating of one mvi toattempt to physically
defeat, subdue or destroy an adversary.
To further bolster up his determination
not to do anything so mucii against
public policy and morality as to pay his
trainer for teaching him the manly art oi
prize-fightinp; Mr. Slinrkey cites the de
cison of Judge S'Uider.-ton in the ca-e of
Filzjirarnons vs. Sharkey, when the court
refused 10 entertain the matter ai all and ,^
ordered ihe complaint stricxen from the
tiles of the court.
Upon the consideration of these ideas
of public policy and morality, and be
cause he does not wish to riolnte any of
tho law-! of the land, particularly with
regard to the paying out of money, Mr.
Sharkey asks thai the complaint of his
trainer, Mr. Allen, be dismissed with
costs. ___________^
NO REBATE TO j-XPOKTEBS.
An Important Decision on Suga* Draw
backs on Canned Fruit*.
Collector J. H. Wise has received in
structions from the Secretary of the Treas
ury relative to the liquidation on draw
buck or rebate on refined cane sugar in
canned fruits for export. The instruc
tions are self-explanatory, as here seen:
Washington, D. C, March 11, 1897.
Collector of Custtms, Han trcmcUcoâSw- The
department duiy received your letter of the
26th ult., furttier in rotation to the question
wnether the rates of drawback on sugar used
IB the canning of iruit for export which were
revoked by the circular (No. 120) of August 1,
1896, can be restored. It appears that the
allowance of drawbact on imported rehued
Micur used in preparing and canning iruit
was discontinued lor the reason that all nat
ural ripo fruits contain some cane sugar and
tlmt the cane sugar present irom the fruit
itself can by no means bo distinguished from
the imported cane hUjjar added in the canning
process, and consequently that the quantity
of imported sugar toutained in the exported
article cannot be ascertained in the manner
contemplated by sectiou 22 of the act of Aug
ust 28. 1894. â¢ â¢ â¢ t
I have to inform you that Inasmuch as the
quantity of imported suffar contained in the
exported preserved fruit cannot bo a-certained
without recourse to other means than the
analysis oi the exported article itself, a restor
ation oi drawback on Bnid article ib deemed
incompatible with the rirst proviso of section
22 of the act of August 28, 1894. which re
quires that the imported material shall so ap
pear in the finished article that the quantity
thereot may be ascertained.
This decision directly affects a large
and growing industry oi this State. The
purpose of tne drawback on cane sugar
was 10 encourage the manufacture and
export of canned goods, tne same as on
raw svik. However, in the matter of tne
sugar, the Government found that it was
getting tbe worst of the bargain, for the
saccharine matter as represented in the
finished article was always greater than
t c amount of imported sugar actually
used, thus making the rebate exceed the
amount of the duty.
PURE- FOOD CAMPAIGN.
The Committee Will Soon Cod
fer With the Board of
Health.
Result of tbe Prosecutions Before
Ju'ge Cumpb-il â Cases to B;
Appst led.
The pure-food committee of the Council
of Associated Industries was in session
yesterday afternoon, and as the result of
its deliberations decided to accept an invi
tation extended to it by the Board of
Health to confer with tho latter on the
subject of adulterated foods.
Tne members present yesterday were
Isidore Jacobs, representing the San Fran
cisco Frait Exchange, who acted as chair
man; Charles R. Allen of the Chamber of
Commerce, James W. Kerr of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, J.
A. Filcher of the State Board of Trade, P.
J. Healy of the Mechanics' Institute, B.
N. Rowley of the State Board of Horticul
ture, David Rich of the State Development
Committee and U-car Lewis, secretary of
the committee.
The chairman, in opening the meeting,
reierre.l to the successful prosecutions in
Judge Campbell's court last Monday. The
decision of the court, he pointed out, was
of far-reaching importance, and would
ultimately; affect an enormous quan
tity of adulterated goods imported from
the East. The Dis'.rict Attorney felt con
vinced that tbe law would be sustained in
every particular in case of appeal in ac
cordance with tne action of State and
Federal courts in other parts of tne
Union. The Board of H-aith had sue
gested the advisability of a general con
ference of the various commercial bodies
of the City, and of the State if possible,
being held at an early date in conjunction
with the board to discuss the subject.
The Board of Healtn, it was afterward
stated by members of the committee, is
alone authorized to ta&e action, but be
fore resorting to thoroughly drastic meas
ures in its attempt to stem the tide of
adulteration, wishes to learn the senti
ment of the public with reference tq the
j same, and considers that a conference of
this description will be the nioit satisfac
tory means of arriv ng thereat. After
some discussion Mr. Filcher offeree, the
following resolution, which was adopted:
Resolved, That it be the sense of the commit
tee on pure foods from the Council of Asso
ciated Industries that it accept the invitation
of the City Board of Health to confer with it
on the subject of adulterated foods.
William Cline, grocer, 949 Market street,
who was convicted by a jury in Judge
Campbell's court Monday night for violat
ing the adulterated food act, was sen
tenced yesterday to pay a fine ot $50, with
an alternative of fifty days in the County
JaiL
Attorney A. Campbell, for the defend
ant, gave notice of appeal and filed the
necessary bond.
Chris Nuhrenberg, J. Barclay Smith and
J. Levi waived a ]iiry and their cases were
set for trial on March 23, 24 and 25 respec
tively.
A. Quade, H. Rathjen, W. Cline, N. P.
Olsen, Jonn iÂ±. Kanip, Henry Schroeder
and A. A. Brunner demanded a jury, and
their. cases were continued till March 23
to be set.
LAWEENSEN'B DEATH.
It Wat Accidentalâ The Funeral Largely
Attended.
The funeral of Christian Lawrensen,
who died through an accident on Wednes
day last, took: place on Sunday and was
attended by a very large number of mera
bars of fraternal orders. It was held from

ered one of the best appointed funerals
held here for a lone time.
Mr. Lawrensen lived with his wife and
stepson at 520 O.ik street. On Wednesday
evening he expressed an intention of tak
ing a bath before retiring. On returning
from a lodge visit his wife was horrified
to find that he had succumbed to the
fumes of escaping gas. The Coroner's in
quest disclosed the facts that his heart
was weak and that the gas fixtures were
defective. Tbe jury returned a verdict of
accidental death.
The widow is prostrated with grief and
Mr. Lawrensan's death is besides mourned
by a large circle of friends.
Mate Keud Acquitted.
David Read, first mate of the ship W. F.
Babcock, was tried by jury yesterday in the
United States District Court on a charge of
cruelly beating and wounding a sailor named
William Pinceval. The evidence showed that
on September 26, 1896, while the vessel was
on the way to tins port, there was trouble be
tween the officer and the nailor, and that the
former bent the latter with a bela.lDg pin.
The jury brought in a verdict of "not guilty,"
which was a great surprise to all who had
heard Â«.he evidence and the Judgo's charge to
the jury.

FOUR FAVORITES
WERE DEFEATED
So All of the Sports Did
Not Depart for Car
son City.
Cash Day Got the Decision Over
Santa Bella in a Close
Finish.
Miss Ruth Tork the Opening Race at
Odds of 25 to Iâ Tom Griifin's
Martha a Fast Filly-
Many familiar faces were missed at the
track yesterday, large delegations of the
sporting fraternity having taken their de
parture for the scene of the big fight.
However, the crowd in attendance made
free with their money and the bet
ting was good. Outsiders In the betting
had much the best of the argument, but
two of the six favorites scoring. LittlÂ«
Scot, a horse backed down from 100 to 15
to 1, gave the ring a scare by bMng beaten
but a head in the first race decided.
The rejuvenated cripple, Cash Day, was
in winning form and succe ded in captur
ing the rifth race, a six-furlong sprint for
a princely $350 purse, by tbe narrowest of
margins. The Chicago delegation soon
caused his opening odds of even money
to be rubbed to 9to 10. Bellicoso and imp.
Santa Bfila were about the only ones of
the other starters to command any back
ing. H. Shields cot the favorite away
lrom tne post well, but quickly took him
back until he was last of his field. Away
from the post poorly Thorpe on Bellicoso
showed in front as the stretch was
reached with Santa Bella at his heeis. The
latter mare soon headed Burkes big
sprinter, and was not caught until tbe last
few jumps, when Shields managed to get
up with the odds on choice and was given
tbe decision. Bellicoso was a poor third.
The opening seven-furlong purse, with
"dogs" galloping to the post, furnished a
sixteen rare guessing match. Tar and
Tartar opened a 1 to 2 favorite, receding to
evens. A very warm tip on Little Scot was
passed about, causing the horse's odds to
be gradually swiped from 100 down to 15.
The rank outsider headed Biily Aycrs in
the ttretcb and at tbe paddock looked a
probable winner, when it seemed as
though Williams grew over-confident and
Miss Ruth beat him a head. The winner
was a 25 to 1 shot in the ring.
The 3to 5 favorite in the three and a
half furlong scramble for two-year-olds,
Don Luis, developed about as much speed
as a "busted sport" returning from Car
son. Potentate, a racy looking son of Ra
cine, led to within about fifty yards from
the wire, where a sleeper, Sadie Schwartz,
with odds of 20 to 1 about her, happened
along and won easily by a couple of
lengths. The favorite was one of the tail
enders.
Tully Coulter's filly Woodland Belle was
heavily backed at odds of 11 to 5 to
win tne third event over seven furlongs,
but was kicked in tbe^nigb hind leg while
the field was at the post and took no part
in the running. Grandezia, a 5 to 1 choice,
ridden by Little Clawson, showed in front
all the way, and won hard ridden at the
end by half a length from Altanera in 1:31.
Queen Nubia was a tired third.
The Baldwin youngster, Rey Salazar.was
backed down from 6 to 2 to 9 to 5 to win tbe
second two-year-old scramble, and fai|Â«sd
to set away part of the purse. Tom Grif
fin's filly Martha, heavily played by the
ex-jockey at 4 and |5 to 1, outfooted Col.
Dan through the stretch, winning by a
neck, rattlinir off tbe three and a half fur
longs in 42}Â£ iecond!Â«. The winner was
excellently ridden by Marty Bergen,

The Association Decided Upon
Some Few Changes in
Its By-Laws.

' |
The twenty-second annual convention
of the United States Railway Mail Service
Mutual Benefit Association convened
yesterday morning in the Young Men's
Christian Association Hall.
President P. P. Warring called tne con
vention to order and introduced Mayor
James Pbelan, who welcomed the visitors
to this City.
Superintendent Troy of the Chicago
Poatolfice, and Superintendent Flint, lo
cated in this City, briefly reviewed the
work of the railway mail Burvice since it
was started in 1843.
The committee on credentials, consist
ing of Josepn Rositer, J. T. Van Meter, 0.
B. Wagner, W. Rhodes. A. L. Bohymer, M.
J. Dolan, C. E. Wiley, F. S. Putnam, Fred
Wescott, W. S. Corning and G. W. Rat
leff, reported 173 people as delegated to
attend the convention and an attendance
of 170. Tne absentees were J. M. Moore
and A. J. Srnitt) of Division 5 and A. D.
./Morgan ot Division 9.
The votes ot the absent delegates were
given to their respective divisions.
The secretary-treasurer's report showed
a mortuary list of twenty-nine in the tiscal
year against a membership of 3657. The
average age at death is 36 years. Only six
deaths are booked to railroad accidents.
The committee on legislation advised
that no more than a $2000. insurance policy
be allowed any member.
The changes in the constitution and by
laws caused the convention to spend hours
over matters that could have been de
cided in short order bad they been al
lowed at once to pass according to the de
cision of the committee appointed a year
ago at the last convention. The recom
mendations of tiie committee were nearly
all adopted.
The main discussion was on the advisa
bility of .having regular pnysicians at
tached to old line insurance companies as
examiners. It was decided that the old
system of accepting certificates from fam
ily physicians would be continued.
The committee on legislation was in
creased from three to live members, and
the board of directors will henceforth be
nine instead of seven.
The proposal of the board of directors
that the executive committee be allowed
$25 per annum each brought up a spirited
debate and was finally voted down.
Tne delegates propose devoting a great
deal more time oi this convention to
pleasure than they do to business.
List night they put in most of their
time at the promenade concert. This
morning they have two pleasure excur
sions on hand. Superintendent Flint of
the local posi office is to meet the visitors
at U o'clock and join in a private "stag"
party about town.
The second excursion is to be on the
bay.
Business of the convention will be re
sumed to-morrow morning.
President Warnnjr's report as filed
shows an increase of 560 members in the
past eighteen months.
The visitors who desire to do *o will
assemble on the steps ot the Mint this
morning and be photographed at 9
o'clock, prior to their trip on the bay.
SUCCESSFUL RICHMOND.
The Wants of the District Being At
tended To by the City's Repre
sentatives.
The Richmond residents, through the
Point Lobos Improvement Club, have suc
ceeded in the point of getiing pretty nearly
everything asked for, and the present is
no exception to that rule, for both the Su
pervisors and the School Directors have
acted favorably -to the petitions of the peo
ple of that section.
The paving with bitnmen of First ave
nue, from the Military Reservation to
Golden Gate Park, has at last been ordered
by the board, notwithstanding the protests
and opposition of a few residents who op
posed the improvement.
Now that the work has been formally
ordered a first-class boulevard will be pro
vided between the points mentioned,
which will give a pleasant and direct drive
way from north to south between two
pleasure grounds.
The next request coming from the peo
ple of the Ricnmond district was for an
other school building on the northern
slope of the hill between California and
Clement streets and Seventh aim Eighth
avenues, upon which block there is a
schoolhouse lot. The Board of Education
has consented to have it erected.
The third but not the least important
branch of the municipal government â
the Park Commission â has also heartened
to the request of the people through the
improvement club, and will order Point
Lobos avenue put in good condition, so far
as the funds at its disposal will permit.
With tbo*e public improvements going on
the property-owners are fully keeping pace
by erecting new buildings.
The exterior work on the Maria Kip Or
phanage is complete, while the interior
finishing touches are nearing a similar
condition.
The old Bay District race course is al
most rilled in and laid out in streets
and avenues, and it will ere long have
hundreds of dwellings rising over it.

DO NOT EXPECTORATE.
thief Crowley'a Views on the Enforce
ment of the New Ordi
nance*
The ordinance making it a misdemeanor
for nny one to expectorate on the public
sidewalks, in the corridors of public build
ings and in streetcars was signed by Mayor
Pbelan yesterday.
Chief Crowley was asked last night as to
his views regarding the enforcement of
the ordinance.
"I have not yet received an official copy
of the ordinance," said the Chief, "but as
soon as it is sent me I shall instruct the
different captains to see that it is en
ldrcrd.
"I recognize the fact that it will be a
difficult matter to enforce it. Tafte streat
carÂ«, for instance. We cannot have an
officer on each streetcar, and suppose a
passen er expectorate* in the car, who
will arrest him if he ahonld leave the car
before an officer can be seen by the con
ductor?
"Then, again, take a crowded thorough
fare like Market street. A man is not
going to expec.orate on the sidewalk in
tne presence of an officer, and with so
many people passing and repassing it will
be almost impossible to make an arrest.
"However, the mere fact that a man
leaves himself open, to arrest by expec
torating on the gidewaiks will have a ten
dency to make him observe the law in
that respect."
EETOET 00USTE0U3.
Paigage of Wit Between a Judge and
an Attorney.
Upon an application for a counsel fee in
the probate department of the Superior
Court yesterday, one of the most reputable
practitioners sail that the amount asked
for was not named, with a view to reduc
tion Dy the court, as he understood was
the custom in this tribunal.
The court responded that it was sorry
that such an impression should prevail,
for while it was true that a few of the
attorneys exaggerated tbeir applications
with an expectation that the Judge would
reduce them, yet the majority of the
members of the bar acted in eood faith
and wi;h a view to maintaining their
standing as honest men seeking no more
than their just dues.
The practitioners who sought unduly to
enhance their emoluments, he said, and
to obtain exorbitant allowances, although
occasionally successful, wre marked by
the court, and their temporary advantage
meant their permanent 10-ss of caste in
the profession and credit with the court.
The Export Beef Law.
Many months ago a United States Inspector
of Mtais for the export trade was appointed

spector at this port has been or. duty ever
since. The act under which he was appointed

Wise: -.-:â¢'â

WHEELMEN AT WAR.
Litigation Over the Proponed Bicycle
Toumauiriit In Thi* City.
Bicycle enthusiasts are saddened by the
prospects of litigation that threatens to in
terrupt the proposed wheelmen's tourna
ment at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
The Velodrome Company, through its
attorney, Edward Landie, yesterday filed
two suits in the Superior Court asking for
alike numoer of restraining orders, or.o
directed against the Mechanics' Institute
and the other against the San Francisco
Amusement Company, preventing the
former from granting and the latter fr^m
securing a lease of the Mechanics' .Pavilion
for the purpose of holdin bicycle races.
The San Francisco Amusement Com
pany is represented principally by Gibbs
& Groom, and the present suits are the
outcome of their differences with the
plaintiff roncerning a bicycle tournament.
R. M. Welch and the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen are also namea as defend
ants, and the Velodrome Company has
signified a determination to tight the mat
ter out if it take-* all summer.

Merlo.FIGHTING FOR A
TRIL BY JURY
Mrs. Craven Ready for. the
Ordeal on Her Deeds
to Begin.
' Attorney Delmas Thaws Out
â¢ ; * the Invitation to a Legal
Banquet
But the Fair People Figbt Shy and
Will Struggle Desperately
.â¢ *. . for More Time.
It will not be the fault of the Craven
attorneys if the effort of the Fair people to
delay the trial of the pencil deeds by an
attempt- to thwart the wish of the
5 woman to have a jury in' the case
succeed?. Judge Slack spent yester
. day listening to the merits of her re
.quest. Attorney Delmas had the floor
, morning and afternoon .to expound
â  the law. It was, of course, a legal argu
ment, but there was spice and relish in
terlarded through it that gave it a zest to
the layman.
f ' Imas is anxious to go to trial at once
with the big case. It should have begun
Yesterday .morning, but at the last mo
\ Afient Charles' L. Wneeler discovered that
'the, cause was one which the bonanza
heirs were not anxious to submit to a
jury. Forthwith on behalf of Miss Vir
gmia Pare there was interjected into the
affair the fog of equity ; that is, that the
heiress 1 rights could be better determined i
in a court of equity. '
It was to fight this plan of delay on the
â  part of the army of lawyers in the employ
of the dead bonanza king's millions that
Delmas was fighting, and in his odd satiri
cal moments he took some strong thrusts
at the Fair people.
S There was a grim satire in his invita- j
tion to the long-delayed legal banquet. I
â¢Your high-priced experts are her.?," be I
bega;n. "Professor Kytka is here with his
big Camera. Your double magnifying
glasses and your microscopes are here. If
all these facts which you have dinned into
our ears are true, if our deeds are forger
ies, which you ought to be now able to
prove by the voluminous evidence you |
have, taken, and the army of experts,
cameras and microscopes, come and prove
â  it. We are ready for the ordeal now.
''It our deeds are foreeries they can be !
proven so in a court of law, and a jury 'â 
verdict to this effect will annihilate taem i
as thoroughly as any decree of a Judge !
sitting as a chancellor in a court ol equity '
! It the deeds are bad in law they are bad !
in equity.
â  "\ou have declared they are forgeries.
Now is your time to prove it."
The attorney proceeded to lay down the
law and- the facts-. The lawyers who had
charge of th interests of the estate had
all, in a written agreement, stipulated
that the case could be tried by jury upon
a ten days' notice. It was the Fair people
who cad asked for repeated delays, and
now when the court had decided that no
more of these tactics would avail any
thipe, other subterfuges had been resorted I
<o. The bonanza interests had said that j
Mrs. Craven had no tile to the property j
the, claimed, forsooth nothing could be
more easier than la make good.; . . - . -*~i
{ ."The suit was a plain action to quiet I
I title, continued Delmas. "Nobody ever i
J dreamed it was anything else," he con- |
I
tinued, ''and this was an issue for a jury to
pa-s upon." Decisions and legal references
were quoted at length.
"For months," concluded the attorney,
"we have been called forgers. The news
paper^ have been filled with interviews
and statements to hamstring and cripple
our cause. The Grand Jury has been in
voked, and a criminal persecution against
our witness threatened, burely now that
we ask that we be tried for these charees,
our request will De granted. If the
or.er side could prove these deeds fraud
jty a simple 'mathematical ciemonstra
â¢ ''i.' we ask that it be done. If our wit
wsses couid be convicted id the criminal
clurts a jury would have done so. We
ask that in this trial, when the reputa
tion and even the liberty of Mrs. Crav<*n
is at stake, if it be proved her deeds are
forgeries, tliat we be also tried by jury."
Attorney Wheeler will take up the dis
course this morning to fieiit for delay.
AN AMLEICAN OHINAM^K
Interesting Hintory of UÂ»Â» H. Forester
or Lansing, Mlcli.
In- bis ''Personal Recollections of the
Taipirig Rebellion," whicii occurred In
China liiirtv years ago, General Edward
Fort>ster, who commanded the imperial
force?, rebates an interesting story of the
capture of Singpu, a Chinese city in the
hands of the rebe s, hundreds of whom
were captured Â»nd beheaded by order of
Li Hung Chang, who was then at the head
of the Government.
"Among those led out one day to be
slausrntered." General Foster write?, "was
jlie lj-year-old son of one of the Wangs.
Used as X hart become to bloodshed ami
death. I could not stand by and see tnis
innrcent lad murdered. When I inter
ceded with" the Mayor he readily con
sented to spare Ihe boy* life.
"The lad turned out to bi a bright-witiert
and tender-hearrert little iellow. I kept |
him with me whiie in China as assistant j
to my steward, and he subsequently ac- !
companies me to Egypt and Europe. |
1 inally I brought him to this country and j
B; laced him in school at Clayton, N. Y. j
\n attaining manhood he settled at Lau
ling, Mich., where be married an Ameri- i
can girL A few months ago, wnile tray- j
ejinÂ« in the Western States, I stopped at
Lansing and hunted up my ex-steward.
It was a pleasant meetmg, lor I found him
n happy business man of considerable
property."
â¢The little Cliinese lad thus befriended
by General Forester is to-day a leading |
business man of Lansing, with but faint i
I recollections of his childhood life in the
â  Flowery Kingdom. He has taken the
| name of his illus;rious benefactor, and is
I known by the name of Usa H. Forester.
He carries on an extensive bazaar-store
and is the owner of considerable property
in Lansing. He hns an intelligent, iv
' teresiing lamily, and, save only in ihe
'general contour of his features, he is as
i thoroughly American as any of his neigh
! bors.
"My parents lived in a place called Zing,
in the interior of China," said Mr.
Forester, a day or two ago, duriug an in
teresting chat upon his rather eventful
! history. ''We seemed to be in danirer and
i had determined to leave the city. We
traveled all night, goina in the direction
of the mountains, where we thought we
should he safe, when we feil into the hands
of the lebels. I remember that I ran
bacK to a town, but they followed me and
took me prisoner. When I trieil to get
away again a soldier stabbed me in the
| leg. After that I went with the rebels
i peacefully. They kept me prisoner, as
' near as I can lix the time, about eight
| months, when the city where we were
stationed was captured by General Fores
ter. The general is mistaken, I think,
: regarding the danger I was in when he
i beiriendel me. I was a prisoner of the
; rebels and was not in danger of execution.
However, I do not underestimate the ser
j vice which he rendered me."
Mr. Forester says he never was so
frightened in his life as when he first saw
the English soldiers under General Gor
don's command. "'I dad never seen a
foreigner before," he said, "and the sight
of the strange-looking men nearly scared
me to death."
"You have no desire to return to your
natve country?"
"None, except from curiosity. I would
be unabie to locate my relatives or to
make myself known. Ido not know what
became of my pureuts, and I have forgot
ten entirely ray native language. 1 simply
know that my first name, 'Usa.' which I
bore in China, si-niiies in the language ot
my parents 'have wealth.' "
Mr. Forester has resided in Lansing
twenty-seven yars. After leaving school
I at Clayton, N. V., he spent some time as
j a clerk in New York City and at Hagers-
I town, N. Y. He is proud of the fact that
he came to Lansing without a dollar, and
that he has acquired bis present wealth in
the business and social world entirely uu
i aided by others.
ATHLETICS TOR WOMEN.
I New Conditions Kpquire a Higher
Physical )><â  veloiuiieut for the Sex.
Already there is talk of the organiza
! tion of women's athletic clubs in some of
I the large cities. This should cause no
I surprise, says a writer in the Woman's
j Home Companion. A higher physical de
j velopment for women is required by the
rapid advancement of the sex in those
pastimes md business pursuits formerly
monopolized by men. Public sentiment
has undergone a marked change in the
last few years, making it possible for
women to engage in athletics for the im-
I provement of their physical well-being
without exciting horrified comment from
those who have a high regard for the pro
prieties of life. It is no longer contended
I by any considerable number of people
| that in doing this she necessarily sacri
! tices the dignity and refinement oelon^-
I ing to an ideal American womanhood.
All modern arguments seem to be in
! fhvor of stronger and more rugged
physical development on the part of the
weaker sex. It is tne kind of develop
ment that brings the strength necessary
to sustain the burdens and trials of mater
nity, the obligations of wifehood, the
duties of home-making, the responsibili
ties of official trust and the exactions ot
the various fields of usefulness that have
been opened to women ali over this coun
try. Tnere has been an evolution of the
popular conception of the ideal woman.
She may reprosent the highest type of
womanly grac and refinement .and still
Doast of well-trained muscles, steady
nerves, a healthful digestion and a sound

tanght to Mil bnjjr the place of the "chug
ing vine" is unfitted for the newer condi
tions of life. She is unprepared for any of
the many emergencies that may burden
I
her with responsibilities and duties requir
ing strength, self-confidence and endur
ance. Encouragement should be given to
every form of athletics, properly con

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1897.
THE LATEST THING
IS AIRSHIPS
Charles Stanley of the Mis
sion Adds One to the
Collection.
He Has Fixed His So That It
Will Alight Safely as
Well as Fly.
Uncb Sam Has Given Him a Patert
and Now Capital Is All That
Is Need d.
The imaginative flock: of airships is
larger by one because of Charle9 Stanley's
fanciful genius,
Mr. Stanley is an industrious and
thoughtful middle-aged mechanic now
employed at the Mission foundry out on
Harrison street and he is also one of those
men with an inventive turn of mind
whose nights are given to studying how
to make ideas work by machinery and
whose careers may be trailed by the
patents they have dropped. He belongs
so for to that great majority of this class
who have not been able to get rich inÂ»,any
thing but inventions. Up at Vallejo he
The Stanley Patented Flying Machine, Which Is the Latest
Mission Invention.
once created a boat intended to be sailed,
rowed or propelled like a bicycle, and
while he was a niotorman on the San I
Mateo electric road he devised a irolley
that wouldn't slip and a track brake that
would stop any car in live feet.
But he thinks that he has achieved suc
cess at last. He realizes in advance that
it is plain that his airship will go to New
York in thirty-six hours and a local capi
talist is waiting to see his model work be
fore putting ud the $5000 needed to build
one a hundred feet or so long.
The Stanley airship has been patented,
and so it lias become a new invention, and
then airship ideas are all interesting.
This one consists of the familiar aluminum
cylinder Tilled with gas and driven r.ith
propellers, and the inventor depends on
his new devices for its success.
The upper four-fifths of the aluminum
cylinder consists of compartments to bi
tilled with lbs, and the rest rffords a sort
of basement for machinery, Ireight and
passengers. Mr. Stanley figures out that
with^a cylinder, the main part of which is
100 feet long and 40 feet in diameter, he
will have a weight of stiip and macuinerv
of 6000 pounds and a buoyancy of 8000
pounds, leaving a margin of nearly a
ton for passeneers, baggage and freight.
This buoyant body' is to be moved
through the air by two propellers, at front
and rear, the front one hauling on the ship
and the rear one pushing. The machin
ery in the lower part of the cylinder will
consist of an engine of great lightness to
use some power yet undecided upon, and
the necessary sbaiting, gearins, etc.
The front propeller is one of Mr. Stanley's
novelties, he says; but the two chief im
provements on the other aluminum cylin
der plans are horizontal propellers above
and the aeroplanes on the side. The
great inconvenience about airships is the
necessity for alignting now and then, and
it is recognized by all rirship inventor*
that alighting on the foreign element be
low it something worthy of grave consid
eration. It must be done with gentleness
and in good oid'i, for a great airship
thrashing around amid blasts und barbed
wire fences would be a saddening spec
tacle.
Most airship inventors count on swoop
ing close to the earth and poiiina de>i
cately wlu.e anchors and hawsers are
thrown out and made fast, whereupon t he
great fabric may be lashed <iown. But
there is great danger in anchoring on the
swoop and poise, and Mr. Stanley's hori
zontal propellers solve the difficulty.
When the buoyant ship is fairly over the
depot area these propellers will steadily
and with any needed degree of uentleness
force the shipdownwara to the anchorage
while the other propellers hold the
nozzle against the wind.
T .ore is a rudder for lateral steering
and side aeroplanes, or rather mdd. rs for
turning tue ship upward or downward.
O-ber inventors have fixed one big rudder
on the side lor this purpose, but Mr. Stan
ley says that they would tilt the bhip to
j the angle of the incline of the course, and
i he will have three or more working syn
chronously, but of ft iff -rent sizes, with the
largest behind. Thus the ship will main
tain a horizontal position.
The pilot will stand in the front part of
the cylinder with windows be'ow, above
and about him, with his band on the rud
der-wheel ana by an engineer's signal
cord and two levprs. These levers will
work the side rudders. Now, wnen the
pilot wants to turn to one side very
auickly he can suddenly pull one lever
and throw the planes on one side into a
vertical position. They will t us act like
one oar in the water, retarding ihe prog
ress ot one side and adding to the effect \of
the rudder behind.
The whole device is rather simple, and
Mr. Stanley says that he is so sure that it
wiil work that if he had the money, he
would put every cent into a big one with
out wasting any of it on experimental
models. The details of provid'ng state
rooms and lor passengers, etc., will come
later.
'â¢I estimate that this ship would go to
New York in th'rty-^ix hours," said Mr.
Stanley yesterday. "There would possibly
be two or three stops on the way with
v. cant lois fixed up lor landing, tnough
they needn't be large, and two men would
be enough at the depot grounds. We
would riirtit nway get the contract lor
carrying the United States mails, and with
the savins in time, rich people would pay
more t an they would on the cars. Our
operating expenses would bÂ«i next to
nothing. For safety, I would rath-r ride
on tbnt airship than on a motor oar."
Mr. Stanley is building a model one foot
long to work by clock work. T.e patent
waa secured February 6, by Attorney C.
H. Hubbs, and the invention is now
among the airships of tue Patent Office.
A Curious Salutation.
When l'etberick, the traveler, camo
upon the Mehr tribe of the Nile country
he was Riven a ereat rec-ption by the na
tiv -s. Finally the head chief of the Mfthr*
entered Petherick's tent. The latter ex
tended bis a and to welcome the visitor
upon which the latter deliberately spat
into toe open palm. Petherick was so en
raged by the seCming indignity that he
was about to knock the chieftain down.
On second thought he resolved to return
the compliment, which he did with more
emphasis than elegance. This seemed to
delitht the chief, and later PetLerick
learned that spitting into the visitor's
hand was the mode of salutation in that
country.
MAKING THE TORTILLA.
Process of Producing Mexico's Main
Article of Food.
Edward Pa*xe Gaston. writing in "Bread
making in Mexico and Zuniland," in the
January Woman's Home Companion,
thus describes the making of the Mexican
tortilla: "The tortilla is typical of old
Mexico anu is encountered wherever the
influence of the cactus republic has
reached. It was found as the main article
of food among the ancient Aztecs at the
time of the Span-sh conquest more than
three and a half centuries ago, and the
little hand-ground and palm-fashioned
corncake has well he.d its own down
through the ages, being to-day as popular
and in as general use as ever."* * *
Shelled corn intended for this u;-e is first
soaked over night in limewtaer until the
outer husk of the kernel is loose enough to
be removed by being rohe l between the
han'ls, and is then ready for grinding.
"This is done by the Mexican women of
the lower class, who often work in the
doorways of their homes, bending over
the historic stone handmiil called in Mex
ico a nictate. The mill is simply a rough
slab of stono supported by four stocky
legs, and is made of volcanic tn'a, the
coarse grain of whicn is best adapted for
the grinding of corn, beans, chile, seeds,
cheese or whatever it may be desired to
finely pulverize. The stone handmill is an
indispensable iiem in the culinary outfit
of the tropical home. The accompanying
handpiece, looking like a rude rolling-pin,
is also of stone, and i* briskly worked up
and down the incline of the stone table by
the woman as she bends to her work with
a steady swing of body, shoulders and
arms. * * * It is claimed that the flour
for the tortilla can be perfectly milled only
by their ancient methods, and w;<en one
sees i be result of the Krindins he is ready
to admit that possibly they are ri^ht.
"As the moist windrows of the meal
roll off the prinding-hoard it is caught in
a basin, and is then all ready for being
formed into caKes for baking. When
ready to bake a woman tnkas a small
lump of the heavy mixture and lay* it in
the palm of her hand; then, with the
other hand, she rolls it into a ball, and be
gins to quickly pat it Into the required
thinness, deftly spreading; the finders to
allow it to enlarge its size, and changing
it from hand to uand until it is only an
eighth of an inch in thickness and gener
ally about six inches in diameter, although
sometimes as large as a dinner plate.
* * * The plastic calces are tossed, one
after another, as convpieied, upon thr
st.-v , called a bra^ero, and n.~ fast as deli
cately browned and turned they are placed
in a steaming heap, enveloped in a cloth
to keep them warm, and from which arises
a most tenanting odor."
CAPTAIN JAMES WATSON.
An Clltl-XJme tNavigator'a Remarkable
Career.
An eventful and moat interesting career
was closed by the death of Captain Jaine*
Watson, which occurred at bis home in
the town of Westchester, say* the New
York Times. Although 98 years ol i, he
retained his mental and physical vizor in
an extraordinary degree up to the day <>:
his death. On Thursday evening he wss
apparently in good health. Early the
next morning came a siroke of paralysis,
which proved fatal.
When 15 years old young Watson went
on his first voynge as cabin-boy on the
Havre packet ship Courier. This was in
the spring of 1814, and J. Feniniore
Cooper and George W, Biunt, the latter
afterward noted as a by irosrapher and
nautical publisher in this city, were cabin
bovs on the same ship. Both Cooper and
Biunt retired from the me-chant marine
service soon afterward, but Watson Btuck
to it and worked himself up, step by step,
to the rank of captain. Ho commande i
ihe packet ship Albany in 1832 and in 1837
was mane captain of the fine new Havre
packet Virginian. It has been often said
of Captain Watson that he was one of the
most popular navigators with both ship

owners and passengers that ever sailed
out of the port of New York.
In consequence of his high stamUngas a
trustworthy and safe commander bis ves
sel, the Virginian, was chosen by the Gov
ernment to bring the French indemnity
money to this country three generations
ago. Many notable men and their faniili s
were passengers on the Virginian to ana
from Havre. Commodore Stockton, who
wa%one of his passenger j, presented Cap
tain Watson with a valuable telescope,
why:ii is still in possession of the family.
Captain Watson was a close observer of
tne great Napoleon's career, and his per
sonal relations with residents of Havre
and other French cities brought him in
touch with some of the events of that
stirring period in the history of Europe.
On one of his voyages Cap'ain Watson ran
his vessel into the port of Liverpool just
atter tne news reached there of the battle
of Waterloo. In after years he was able
to recall a great many interesting details
of the Napoleonic period.
About tiftv years ago Captain Watson
retired from business and went with his
tamily to live on the ancestral estates in
Westchester. Besides the property left
him by his lather he inherited part of the
estate of his grandfather, Captain Israel
Hunnywell of the Revolutionary army.
He retaned all of this property tor asso
ciation's sike until a year or two ago,
when hrt was induced to sell about thirty
acres. The old navigator's life was
singularly tranquil and enjoyable for
the past two score of years. He
made many friends, and be de
lighted to entertain them. His mind
remained remarkably clear to the
last, and he kept himself thoroughly
informed on the affairs of the day. Al
though never seeking public preferment,
he always took the liveliest interest in
politics and wa* always on the side of
honesty, conservatism and clean govern
ment. The old gentleman had h e'ear
recoUection of tae war of 1812. He was
one of tbe l&da who helped to throw up
breastworks to defend the city of New
York against the British, and he also paw
the British fleet lying in Westchester
Creek.
Captain Watson leaves two unmarried
d;tU-'liters, Maria Hunnywell and Agnes
Arden Watson, both of whom were with
Him when he died. Funeral services will
be held to-morrow and the interment will
be in the family vault in the old St. Peter's
Churchyard.
OTJDINOT'S MEMOIRS.
Story of Napoleon's Career Told by a
Marshal of the JÂ£inpire.
There seems to be no cml to the litera
ture connected with the Napoleonic era.
The "Memoirs of Marshal Oudinot" are
the theme of exiended review by the Lon
don critics.
Napoleon, after the battle of Marengo,
L-uvti Oudinot the command of a corps in
the camp at Boulogne, where preparations
for a descent upon England again occupied j
the mind of the Emperor. Two years were j
wasted in this work, when Napoleon sud
denly chanted his plans, and hurle.i upon
Central Europe the armies he hi><i intended
to use againsi England. In 1805 the cele
brated Corps of Grenadiers, raised by
Junot, and afterward known us the "infer
nal column," was placed under the com
mand of the young uenerai. It was com
posed of the finest men of the army, and
on more than one occasion decided the
fate of battles. Oudinot was elevated to
the rank of marshal and Duke of the em
pire after the battle oi Wngrarn. His first
wife died in 1810, and in January, 1812, he 1
married Mile, de Coucy, the author of
these memoirs. Oudinot was seriously
wounded at Polotsk, while in command
or the Second Corp3 in the Russian ex
pedition. His young wife, hearing of bis
wound, joined him at Wilna, and shared
in the disastrous retreat of the French
army. Chapters 4 and 5 contain a graphic
detail of their sufferings irom the terrible
and daily increasing cold under which
the Grand Armee gradually melted away.
During the retreat the wounded general
suffered torments.
Dr. Cagriomonl tried to dress the sick
man's wouad, but everything froze be
neath his ands and he had to give up the
attempt. They tried to use the provisions
brougiit on one side from "Wilna and on
the other from Konigsberg, but every
thing â bread, wine, ham, poultry â was
frozen and could not be thawed, even
when put before the stove. A -lieht damp
ness was all that appeared on the outside
of the eatables; the inside remained a3
hard as stone.
In the advance upon Beriin the columns
of Bertrand, Regnier and Oudinot were
unable to CGiscentrate, owing to the diffi
culties of the country, and at Gross- Beeren
the latter received a severe check. This
repulse, combined with others received by
Napoleon's lieutenants, culminated in the
supreme defeat at Leipzig. The Duchesse
describes the confusion at Versa lies on
the eve of the a b I. ration of Napoleon :
It was almost darK when we arrived.
We took possession of two adjacent rooms
In an already crowded inn in the RuÂ«j de
J'Orangerie. During the whole night an
incessant and confused noise told us of the
passage of a laree number of men, horses
and carriages, an I soon the daylight re
vealed the most astonishing sigbt that ;
human eyes perhaps have ever looked j
upon. We stood motionless at our win- 1
dows; what we saw passing, my children,
was . . . the empirp! The empire,
which wa-< departing, with all its pomp
and splendor; the Ministers, ail in their
coache9 and six, Ukin<: with them port
folio, wives, children, jewels, livery; the
entire Council oi State; the archivesjf the
crown diamonds; the administrations.
Ar.d installments of power and magmfi- !
cence were mingled on the road with
humble households who had heaped up
on a barrow all they had been able to
carry away from the houses which they
were abandoning, as they thought, to the
pillage which was about to burst forth
over the country. The cannon had begun
to thunder at daybreak.
TELEPHONED TO HIS DOG.
Now Tom Reynolds HaÂ» to Be Mighty
Careful, or He'll toss the Dog.
i Tom Reynolds of Reynoldsviile. was in
town this week. r Torn has an v intelligent
dog, which was sent to him from Australia
and of which he very fond. The dog is
also badly infatuated with Tom, who has
a telephone in his house. Tom has taught
the dog to understand , that the machine
can talk by holding the - receiver to the
dog's car. On several occasions when Tom
has been away he called up his resilience
and had the dog brought to the 'phone,
when he would talk to the canine in such
soothing language as to rill the canine
with delight. He would, of r course, rec
ognize his master's voice, and make all
sorts of ' demonstrations of joy. - About
two weeks ago Tom brought the no? to
Punx?utawney, ' and while g here talked
over the 'phone' to his friends' at homo.
He also permitted his dog to listen. From
this tlie dog; got the idea mat there were
only two 'phones in existence â one at his
home and.the oilier at the Hotel Waveriy
in Punxsutawney, as the ; circumstance
about to be disclosed will abundantly
prove. ,
â¢ Last ; Saturday Mr. Reynolds came ,to
Punxsutawney and called ud the dog at.
home as ususual. The do? barked and'
whined and made a great ado, all of which'
could be heard over, the wire.
About an hour afterward, just as Tom
was about to leave, judt;e of his surprise
to see his dog come bounding into the
hotel ! He had run fourteen miles in less
than an hour. - : : â¢'' â¢ ; : â 
Now Tom says that, as the dog is firmly 1
of the impression that there is but one
other telephone box in the country besides
tne one in his house, he will not dare to
talk to the doe :rom any other point, be
cause if he does, fiat dog will start imme
diately for the Waveriy Hotel, Punxsu
tawney, expecting to .'hid him there. - V T.
Wire Fences in England.
English devotees of the hunt are meet
ing with occasional disaster on account of
the growing baoic among farmers of in
closing their lands with wire fences,
sometimes barbed, in the place of rail
fences. A few farmers are so obli ing as
to take down these wire fences in' the win
ter, others tie rea rags on the wire, so that
the obstruction may be announced in time
to the horseman, but a few farmers who
are against the hunters on principle say
that if men are going to ride over their
lands they do so at their own risk, and re
fuse to announce the presence of wire.
The other day a six-season mare, as
clever a hunting horse as was in the dis
trict, was litemlly cut to ra s, the strand
of barbed wire being run loosely throngn
the lop of a bed^e and lapp>ng around her
like a snake when she was brought down.
The mare was shot and the rider escaped
a broken neck only by a miracle. This
happened in one ol the most fashionable
hunting distnc'.s.

Painful diseases are bad enough, bat when a

[ is no let up to the mental suffering day or

such a strain men are scarcely 'responsible for:

he now declares that any man who' will take,

NEW YORK, >'. V., March 16.â The sensation
of the day in stock circles was a break in Missouri
Pacific from 19 to 15 on unusually heavy trading.
The old report of a receivership was freely circu
lated, but this time the rumor was met with a
most emphatic denial on the part of the president.
Mr. Gould, in a statement published shortly after
the slump, denied absolutely that a receiver would
be appointed and also expressed his willingness to
cash coupons of the company at their face less
the usual rebate at the rate of 6 per cent per
annum. He also said that the earnings of the
road were improving. In his opinion, the attack
on the stock and the reports of a receivership were
tli" res It cf a desire on the pan of the bears to
cover short sales on other stocks. The denial
alarmed the shorts, a rush to cover followed and
. the stock bounded up to 18%, closing at that
figure.
\V abash stocK and bonds -declined In sympathy,
but the general market iield remarkably well
throughout the raid. In fact, as the dar ad
vanced, railway and industrial stocks hered
strength, and near the close the best injures for a
long time past were recorded in many Instances.
The confident buying o these Issues was the
subject or much comment and had a great deal to
do with the firm front presented by other railway
stocks, iliinois Central, which has been dormant
of late, had a spurt of activity, and in buying for
both local and foreign account advanced about 3
I oints to tti"* i. In the af ernoon Fesslon .Manhat
tan and Western Union were conspicuous a d
mi ved up iV 2 percent each to 87*4 and 8614 re
spectively, covering of short contract! accounts
for the improvement.
In the Industrials sugar was traded in ex-divl
der.d of 3 per cent. The stock was sold down to
11 ';Â« and rose t011'36/a Kubber preferred was In
better demand on the denials of the reports of a
war in the trade. Speculation cioÂ«Â»d strong in
tone. Total sale: were 239,131 shares, of which
65.600 were Missouri Pacific, 50,100 sugar, 8600

to the '-put" price. The influence detrimental to

gard of our advance of ycsterJay was evinced.
Considerate wheat bought last we.-k and yester
day was Dressing for sale at the start, and the sen
timent to buy was not of the sort to prompt free
buying, con seauently the action of the market
was of a retrogressive character. The receipts in
thÂ» Northwest were fair, 250 cars am vine, against
3:27 last Tuesiay. Chicago received 332 cars and

a string market at -t I ou s and a decrease in the
world* available stocks, as reported by Brad

prices. The recovery carried tee market above

William Smith Will Have
to Pay the Penalty
of Eloping.

a Warrant Charging
Perjury.
The Man Who P anned a Runaway

Oakland Office Sax Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March lti. f
When "William H. Smith, who planned
â n elopement on bicycles with Miss Delia
L. TucKer a few months neo, has finished
bis eighteen months' sentence for stealing
two wheels he will probably find himself
with another term to serve.
To-day F. W. Tucker, father of the girl,
swore toa complaint charging Smith witn
perjury. Six months ago Smith induced
Tucker's daughter to run away from home
in San Jose and marry him in this city.
Th.c honeymoon did not last long, !or on
the evening of their wedding day they
>were arrested at the Weber House for steal
ing bicyclf s and Smith was convicted.
The charge of perjury is based on the
fact that he swore Delia Tucker was 19
years of age, when he weil knew she was
but 14 She was, En fact, a mere school
girl with whom Smith became acquainted
while they were living in the same board
ing-house in San Jos?. He taught her to
ride a bicycle, and the girl became very
much attached to him. He planned a
bold scheme to marry the girl and escape
before the father would learn o. ttie aff-iir.
He went to Portland, rented two wheels
and shipped them to Oakland. In this
city he met the girl and they were mar
ried. The police, however, had tr.iced ihe
wnee's, and when they were ordered to
be delivered at the loclginc-house an offi
cer went with them, and as soon as Smith
claimed ownership he was arrested.
Mr. Tucker swore to the charge to-day,
so that as soon as Smith serves out his
sentence in the Oregon prison he will be
brought back liere and tried for perjury.
The father proposes that thÂ« young fellow
Ehail pay the full penalty for his great
wrong.

bullet-hole piercing the brain. He had
shot himself over the left ear, and the
-bullet made its exit over the right ear,
Ira'cturing the skullcap so that but for the
scalp it might have been lifted off the
'skull. By his left side, as he lay across
.the bed, was a 38-caliber Smith & Wesson
revolver with one empty cartridge.
Bcbomborg was a native of Germany, aged
55 years, .and a member of West End
r Lodge, A. O. IT. W. He left surviving a
widow, a married and an unmarried
daughter and a son. Since his bank
ruptcy, he has been in a very despondent
mood over business affairs and took to
.drink. Only last night tie was about the
street consulting friends and acquaint
ances as to the best methods of suicide.
The wound in the left .temple and the
finding of the weapon on the left aide of
the body is readily accounted for, as the
â¢ suicide did not have the free use of his
right arm on account of paralysis. Betore
coming to Alameda, Schomborg was many
years ago in the draying- business for a
ban Francisco wholesale house.

ANCIENT DARKNESS
TO DISAPPEAR
Narrow-Gauge : Mole Will
Soon Shine as the Noon
day Sun.
Old Travelers Will Have to
Protect Their Eyes From
the G!ar>\
For a rter of a Century the Little
Coa'.oil L imps Have Done
Duty.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 16. \
After twenty- live years of darkness the
A'ameda mole is to be lighted. Old
timers who have prown gray crossing the
bay and coing to their homes in Alazneda
or Oakland by . the narrow-gauge route
will undoubtedly receive this piece, of in
;:-â 'â  â¢ â â  â -. â  â  â  â  â 
formation with much snspicion. It has
been promised for many year*, but each
night the flickering little o 1 lamps have
been all the illumination that enabled
them to appreciate the darkness between
the boats and the train.
All kinds of protests have been made
and on numerous occasions the aid of the
newspapers has been invoked to light the
depot that Fair built. But nothing has
been done nor probably would have been
done had not the city of Alameda, which
Oaklanders cynically refer to as "sleepy,"
procured a municipal electric-light plant.
This she has dons and one of her best
patrons will be the Southern Pacific Com
pany. In a few days a hundred powerful
big arc lights will be placed around the
depot, and the effect will be such as no
one can predict, beoause the grpat dark,
smoky, barn-like structure has never yet
been lighted. The dim glass on the ton
has effectually prevented the sunlight from
entering, and the little conloil lamps have
never pretended to do any more than
prevent people from failing through holes
in the whari after dark.
O:d Alamedaus will imngine until they
get used to it, that they have landed at
the brodgauge mole and will be looking
at their fobs and asking all sorts of ques
tions to persuade themse.ves they have
not made a mistake. It is not unlikely
that some of them will have to wear
shades for theireyes till they get accus
tomed.,^ the briEhtness.
The enterprir-e of the little cily in get
ting a light plant that will produce a rev
enue, lis highly commended on all sides,
and the very best advertisement it could
possibly receive will be the lighting of
ibe mole, because every one for months
to come will surely ask, "What are these
bright lights, an i whence came they?"
WATER FOR BERKELEY.
An Abundant Supply Declared
to Be Easily Ac
cessibe.
Subterranean S.re nn cf Great Vo'
urae Said to Flew Under the
C. liege Tcwn.
BERKELEY, CAI., March 16.â The
question of secunnz by tlto town of
Berkeley its own water supply, as stated
In yesterday's Call, has created no in
considerable comment among the citizens
of the college town. Many of tboM who
have been hitherto skeptical with regard
to the practicability of the plan, on ac
count of tbe seeming unavailability of a
sufficient supply easy of Â»ccesÂ«, have been
brought to an opposite view through the
data furnished by A. A. Richardson, a
hydraulic engineer, who has been recently
engaged in prospecting for the source of a
sup i>l y.
The engineer has made an examination
of a lar&:e number of the weils in town
and declares ne has found conclusive evi
dence of ihe existence of a subterranean
stream.
"I hnd," said he. in speaking of his, ex
periments, "that water is reached in a
stratum of sand at from forty to fifty feet
below the surface. It. has been found im
possible, in digging wells, to get more
than five feet below where the sand
begins. The water flows in so rapidiy
that iv i tii as large a force of men as can be
employed no progress In Â»hoveling out
sand can be made.
"Another strong indication i< that the
grains of sand at that depth are round
an) smooth. This proves tiiat there is
motion ana motion, caused by running
water. It is also a significant fact tnat
the water in our wells in sonia cases rises
to within ten feet of the surface, though
not reached till a <!epth of forty feet has
been attained. Other indications are to
be found in the hills, where 1 have seen
water bursting out in ravines. And even
if there were no su^h proofs a strong pre
sumption would still remain. Where does
the water come from tnat is in our wehs
if not in a moving stream from the Sierras?
It is not -urface water."
Mr. Richardson states that a San Fran
cisco firm is preparing to secure material
for a test "tubular wHI" In Berkeley and
will present th town with the necessary
pipes, so that an investigation can be
made.

WHO SHOULD SERVE?
A Question liaised as to- the Legal
ity of Substituting
Justices.
OAKLAND, Cal., March I&â W. F.
Aram has attacked the validity of Justice
Cli't'a action in calling in Justice Law
rence of Brooklyn Township and Justice
Shaw of Berkeley while lie was visiting in
the East and Honolulu. The point is
raised on the language of section 922 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads:
In case of slckne-s or other disability, or
necessary absence of a Justice, on a returu of
a summons or at the time appointed for a
tria;, another Justice of the same townshlD or
city may, at his request, attend in hfs behalf,
and thereupon is vested with power, for the
time beine, of the Justice before whom the
summons was returnable. If the case is ad
journed the Justice before whom the sum
mons was returuab c may resume jurisdiction.
Mr. Aram insists that Justices Allen or
Wood are the" only Justices competent un
der the foregoing law that ooold sit for
Clift. If his point is well taken it woud
upset all of the legal work in Justice
Gii.t's court in about three months.

POISONS IN EVERT-DAY POOD.
Infinitesimal in Quantity, but Virulent
if Concentrated.
One of the curious and little-known facts
brought to light by recent investigations
is that in almost every kind of food some
- 1 1 1 : i: 1 amount of poison is to be found.
Often the quantity is so small that chemi
cal analysis does not reveal it, and ir is
only discovered by certain effects upon the
human system under certain conditions.
Small as these quantities of poison are,
however, in comparison with tne other
constituents of any one food, they do
exist, and are poisons of a deadly sort.
Concentrated, the amount of poison that
is taken into the system during an aver
age lifetime would be sufficient to kill an
army instantly. Yet the extremely
minute fragments absorbed during each
meal not oniy do no harm bat see at almost
health-giving. At leas;, it is certain that
many of ibe most dan erous and destruc
tive substances known exist in tangible
quantities in some of the most valued
tooda.
Foods that contain the worst poison* in
these tiny quantities may be eaten con
stantly without any unfortunate results.
There is no more popular and widely used
Soud than the potato. In Ireland, in cer
tain districts, little else is eaten, and the
peasants thrive wonderfully on them. Yet
the potato be>ongs to the same botanical
class as the deadly nightshade, and has in
it the same poisonous element.
M my other vegetables have the same
curious quality. In nearly every vege
table and fruit that grows above the
ground, except the cabbage class, what
ure known as vegetable acids exist. There
is a different one in each vegetable and va
riety of fruit, and all are deadly poisons.
Nevertheless, it would be impossible to get
a sufficient quantity into the stomach at a
single meal to do even the slightest in
jury, and the gastric juice absorbs and
renders harmless these poisons unlail
inely.
Tap:oca i& another food substance that
contains parson. Tins has long been
known. The fact was a;Â»a n cniled to the
attention of scientists hy Henry M. Stan
ley, who carried in his kil on one of his
journeys in the "Dark Continent" a large
quantity of tapioca, and had the opportu
nity to detect the danger in its use when
not properly prepared, Under proper
conditions tapioca is not harmful, but
poison is present in it in such a large
quantity that many precautions should be
taken.
Even beer has its portion of poison, a
substance known as picro-toxin. Lemon
juice contains a viru ent and dangerous
element â citric acid â and in many of the
lemon drops ana bottles of lemon juice
commercially prepared this aubjtanue is
made up in the laboratory, and mixed with
a disregard ol the way nature does it. The
natural juice of the lemon is not in the
least poisonous, even taken in large quan
tises, but lemon juice chemically made,
aÂ« it frequently is ior th c trade, needs to
be iooked warily at.
Bitter a momH have poison in them to
such a perceptible extent that actual cases
of poisoning are on record. Strawberries
and rhubarb contain oxalic acid. This, as
almost everybody knows, is one of the
most deadly and rapid poisons, when used
in any apiveciable quantity. Ceriain peo
ple are affected quickly by even a few
strawberries. Lobsters, shellfish and crabs
possess an irritant poison which produces
nauspa, vomiting and general depression,
in addition to skin eruptions. In ice
cream is sometimes to bo found tyrotoxi
con, and clam chowder, made under the
best conditions, often ..as ptomaines of a
virulent and dangerous sort.
Cases have gone on recor i in France of
diseases caused by the eating of rye bread.
In these instances the grain became
musty on the stalk and was made into
fl mr without its mustiness having been
noticed. From tuis mustiness, wincti is
not at all perceptible in me bread, the
loweriul poison ergot arise?, causing
eventually, If sufficient of this bread is
taken in;o the system, paralysis of the
extremities. â New York Tribune.
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN.
How s Texan >herlff Captured Jim
Sandes.
When the bheriff went over from Golden
Hill to Lucky Valley after Jim Sanders,
who was wanted for shooting Dan Wil
liams in a quarrel over a game of cards,
he didn't even take a gun along. He
iound his mau in a saloon and asked
him to step up and take a drink. Jim
complied, but kept a hand on his gun.
When they had drunk they sat down, Â«nd
the Sheriff told three or four funny
stories. By and by the puzzled Jim broke
out with:
"See here, Joe, did you come over after
me?"
"Wall, I thought you might want to jog
along back w th me," was the reply.
"Ko: much I I'll never be taken
alive 1"
"Then that settles it. Let's hey an
other drink."
They drank again, and the official told a
very funny story about a tenderfoot's ex
perience in Golden City. Jim laughed as
loudly as ihe others, but presently grew
more serious, and said:
"S;Â«y, Joe, ye can't take me alive I' 1
"Wall, we won't worry about that,
Jim," was the reply. "Let's hey anotuer
nip and then a gameof cards.''
The game lasted until the Sheriff had
lost about $20. Then he ordered drinks
and sang a song. When the song was
finished he said to Sanders:

you to-day?"
"Yon hey, Joe, and no mistake."
"Treated you like a gentleman, hevn't
I?"
"You certainly hey."
"That's my way of doing things. Now
I want you to treat me like a gentleman.
Go back to Golden Gate with me."
"But I shot Dan Williams over thar."
"Of course you did."
"Anil tney want to hang me."
"Of course they do, but that's nothin' to
me. I didn't make the laws. I was sent
out arter you and I want to take you
back. I could have sneaked in and got
the drop on yer, but I knowed 'twould
hurt yer pride. Hevn't I been tender
with yer?"
"You hey, Joe; but I don't want to be
hung."
"I s'pose not; but see bow nice I've
used ye. Would any other Sheriff hey
don it?"
"No, I reckon not."
"Of course not, and if yon are hung
won't I boss the job and make it as easy as
possible? Just come right along to obleege
me, Jim."
"Would it be a ereat favor to you?"
"It would, and it would show me that
you was a gentleman to boot. I'm a gen
tleman myself, and I kin appreciate a gen
tleman."
"Wall, Joe," said Jim, after a moment's
thought, "I did say I wouldn't po, and I
diil think I d dn't want to be hung, but to
obleege you and to show these critters that
I know what good manners is, I'll no

BBUOE AND THE SPIDER.
The Pretty Romance of the Scotch
Warrior Only a Fable.
Another cherished delusion is gone.
Ever since Robert Bruce became a charac
ter in historical literature we have Heard
and believed tho story of the spider, whose
persistent industry before his eyes gave
him fresh courage to renew the struggle
for Scottish liberty against the English
foe. For generations that spider has tone
spinning through the imagination until
the threads of ttie tale became as linn y
fixed in our minds as ever Robert Bruce
was upon his throne. The incident has
been one ot the stock themes in addresses
of school ci.iidreu lor ni h a century.
School histories nave p ; ctured it as one of
the great thing* in their somewhat hazy
records of medieval Scotland.
William Tell and the apple might be
nothint: but a sun myth, but we felt we
could cling to Bruce and the spder; there
was something human and likely about
that, while the exploit of shootinz an ap
ple from a boy's head with a crossbow was
a little uncanny. It seems, however, that
our faith is again to be flouted and once
more the finger of scorn points us out as a
credulous folk, easily pleased with au old
w.ves' tale.
A new life of Robert Bruce is about to
be published, written by one ol those pes
tilent fellows whose thirst for realism is
sufficient to wreck all that is romantic in
twenty literatures if he nave tne oppor
tunity. This historical Gradgrind has
di-covered that there is no foundation for
the story of Bruce and the spider, that the
plucky fellow never watched the little in
sect triumph over obstacles, was never en
couraged thereby to fresh efforts against
h s fot-Â«, and that really the only fact in
the whole business was the fighting, but
that is so remote and so common that no
one is interested. â Brooklyn Eagle.
Senator Quuy as-a Lawyer.
A personal friend of Senatoi Quay, who
has known him intimately tor the past
forty years, tells this interesting story of
the Senator's first and oniy law case: Mr.
Quay had just been admitted to the Dar
and was trying his niakien case. He was
rattier a bashful young man, and above
all things dreaded to speak in puolic
When lie arose to address the jnry lie be
came exceedingly nervoui and could
scarcely proceed with his speech. While
he was still struggling to overcome his
excessive diffidence lie chanced to glance
around and saw some of the other attor
neys in the room laughing. Believing to
a cenaintv that they were laughing at his
forensic efforts, he at once sat down and
refused to proceed iurther wiih his re
mark?. From that d.iy he gave up the
practice of law, refused all cases that were
offered to him, ami entered into local poli
tics with that earnestness which has since
made him one of th most successful poli
ticians of the present day. He began at
ih? botiom of the ladder, first holding a
minor office, and Gradually reaching
higher and higher, until he attained his
present National prominence and power. â

Prospective Heiress Who Supports Her
self Rather Than Live on Relatives.
It has been made public, according to a
Sedalm dispatch to the St. Louis Globe
Democrat, that Miss L. Dray ton Astor, an
heiress and descendant of the late John
Jacob Astor of . New York, is employed as
a chambermaid in Hotel Sicher here un
der the name of Draiie Langdon. She is
a daughter, of W. D. Astor, who died of
lead-poisoning in St. Louis twenty-three
years ago, leaving his only child, Dratie,
as she is I now known, in' charge of her
aunt, wife of the late Major Lancdon.
Six yrars later the aunt died, leaving
Dratie to tight her own way in the world.
She acquired a -common-school educa
tion, anil, possessing, the , fin* busines3
qualifications of her father. Miss As;or
enlisted in the < service of me. Churchill
and was sent out as a public speaker
under the auspices of the National Reform
Association. â  She gave promise of being a
i tine orator,, but three years ago she suf
fered a severe attack of pneumonia, and
was compelled to abandon her vocation on
account of a weak voice. Then she went
to live with her aunt's relatives in Saline
County, Mo. .-:
â  Attorney Garesche of St. Louis, who has
Miss Astor's interests in charge, says that
she will receive a lecacy of $20,000 in June,
1897, i eft her by a cousin. Miss' Drexel 'of
Philadelphia, who recently entered con
vent. She also receives, in October, the
deeds and full title: to a 480-acre tract of
land in Saline County, Mo., which is in a
high state of cultivation and is very valu
able. Â ; â  .' â â "::'
This land is a part of the estate of Miss
Astor's aunt, and it has been in litigation
for thirteen years.. Recently the case nas
been decided :in favor of Mi- Astor, it
having been shown'that it was purchased
with . money belonging to - her father.
This, together with the legacy 'oi her
cousin, Miss Drexel, leaves Miss Astor
quite wealthy, anc 1 Lawyer Garescho says
that by next October he will have dis
posed of three wills, which will leave Miss
Astor in | possession of about $70,000, be
sides which 'she will, receive, after tne Ist
of May next, an annual income of $5000
from the estate of the late J. J. Astor of
New York. â  * :,
- Miss Astor is a prand niece of John Jacob
Astor, deceased. Her mother was a Drexel.
Her father was connected with Blow's
lead factory, St. Louis, and at. the tune of
his death was studying law in the office of
Judge Colt in that city.
She was 12 year? old when her father
died. : M iss ; Astor is - l about the | medium
height, has golden brown hair, handsome
large; blue eyes, fine, clear, open counte
nance, and carries herself with that proud
Astor bearing that cannot be imitated or
counterfeited. She is a perfect Christian
lady in every respect, and has mate many
Jnenda during her two months' residence

A New Bullet.
The British War Department was much
disturbed to find tbat the stopping powers
of ibe bullet of their service rifle, the Lee-
Metford, is so feeb.e that in the Chitral
campaign the soldiers Jos; confidence iv
their weapons. The bullet had great
penetrative power, but a great many
of the tribesmen bit by it ad
vanced as thou-h untouched, and
it comparatively seldom caused instant
death. One tribesman who had been hit
by six bulles was treated in hospital, and
made a quick r*Â»cov<Ty. Steps were soon
taken Dy the War Department to devise
a more destructive missile, and experi
ments nave been made witn a bullet hav
ing a metal-covered point made thin,
witn a lead core slightly exposed. While
the flight of the bullet through the
air is not interfered with, as
it strikes an object it spreads out,
and has almost the terrific power of
laceration of the exD o-ive bullet. A
French officer has endeavored to make a
compromise between tiiese two forms of
projectiles by inventing a bullet having
the maximum power of disabling and the
minimum power of killing. It is made
of paper, with a thin shell of aluminum.
It has the same precision as the ordinary
bullet, but produces a perfectly smooth
wound. The Austrian War Office is now
making trials of the invention.
Jnlea Verne.
Except when he brings out one of hi 3
marvelous books we hear little of M. Jules
Verne, but the fact is that he is leading a
very quiet life at Amiens. Although 68
years of age and wearing the appearance
of a retired general, he is lull of energy
and as hard-working as of yore. He is
now busy in the execution of his plan for
publishing a series of stories bearing on
different countries. Be ore beginning a
particular wort M. Juies Verne leads up a
number of geographical, historical and
other books treating of that part of the
world, ami as he goe3 on the pot gradu
ally germinates in his mind. He is, in
deed, an actfve and laborious toiler, rie
rises regularly at 4 o'clock in the morning
and writes steadily until noon. He retires
to rest at 9, except on two evenings in the
week, when he ai companies his wife to the
Grand Theater, dining before at a restau
rant opposite the building. This is his
great treat, and he is fonu of remarking
that on these occasions he and his wife
enjoy themselves just as it they were a
young couple on tneir honeymoon. Asa
matter of fac, M. and Mme. Jules Verne
have not been near Paris for the last eight
years, an i find that their life at Amiens
suits them perfectly. â London Telegraph.

BREATHED, ONLY
TO BE STRANGLED
A Baby's Body Found in
the Bushes in Golden
Gate Park.
Its D?ath Was Caused by As
phyxiation Produced by
Compression.
The Infant Is Believed to HaY3 B en
Klled by the Cruel Hinds of
It* Parents
â¢.
A case of infanticide, the murder of a
baby that had scare? seen the light of day,
was discovered in Golden Gate Park yes
terday afternoon.
Early in the afternoon a number of
children were playing in the park, near
Stanyan and Bulia streets, when they
found a common barley sack in the
bushes. The opening; of the bag was tied
by a piece of twine. Curiosity prompted
the youngsters to untie the cord and peep
in. They were norrified to discover the
body of a little naked baby.
In less than a minute the children were
out of the park and hurrying to inform
the police. Officer J. W. Durkin investigat
ed and found that the children's story was
correct. He telephoned to the Coroner,
and Deputy Hallett and Messenger Smith
went for the body, from all appearances
the person or persons who deposited the
body there must have dropped the bundle
over the fence during the night. It was
just inside of the part fence close to the
point wnere the steam cars turn out of
Stanyan street on the way to the ocean
beach.
Dr. John Gallagher mad# an autopsy on
the body and bis investigation led con
clusively to tne belief that the little one
had been murdered soon after its birth.
Dr. Gallaeher said : "The body is that of
a male child a few hours old. It was alive
once, foi- its little lungs bad been expan
ded with air. Its death was caused by
asphyxiation produced by compression, I
should judge. There are no marks on the
threat to show that it was stifled to death.
The compression was most likely that of
squeezing the body over the lungs so that
they could not move. Such treatment to
a child young would produce death very
speedily and leave no marks of violence, i
This infant might have been smothered to
death, but I believe that compression was
the cause."
As soon as the police learned the nature
of the case an inquiry was set on foot
amonc the residenisof that part of the
City, but no one had seen anybody there
who had carried a barley sack. It is
likely tiiat the unnatural parents took
such an hour for the commission of this
foul crime and the disposing of the body
that their identity will never be known.
It is also likely that the murder was com
mitted in some other part of the City and
by persons who live a long distance from
the park.
IMPALEMENT OP THE BONNET.
A Painful anil lie ting Incident of a
Now Y< rk Itainstorm.
They were talking of Uie variety of queer
Jitlle incidents which the streets of New
"York have to offer for the daily entertain- j
ment of the idle but observing pedestrian.
"Why. it's a regular continuous per
formance, if you enly keep your eyes open
and look about you," concluded the man
whose "reminiscences" had made him
easily the stsr narrator of the party.
"Indeed. I believe you," remarked the
little wo:nan in the corner, who up lo that
point had contented herself with listening
to the stories of the others. "I believe
you, because I w;s in one act of it myself
yesterday on Twenty-third street. 1 as
sure you tbat I am not particularly proud
of the part I played, but then 1 did it
purely from necessity, not choice.
'â¢When I started out to shop that after
noon the sky was perfectly clear, but in
about an hour it came on to rain very
suddenly, and I was caught without an
umbrella. I had a new bonnet on, too â
one of those tiny things, you know, made
mostly of jet and lace, and barely resting
on the top of my head. It didn't even
have strings to hold it on. WelJ, I was
hurrying along as fast as possiDie, my sole
idea being to get tnat bonnet under the
sheltering roof of the nearest store, when,
happening to glance a little distance
ahead of me. I saw something which fairly
paralyzed me with astonishment. I stood
still for a moment, unwilling tv believe
my eye?. But there waÂ« no Mistake.
"Tiiere was my cherished bonnet, which
I had believed to be perched securely
upon the top of my head, dangling from
the rib of a man's umbreila. several yards
away. Worst of all, the owner of the
umbreila, blissfully unconscious of bis
ridiculous 'caich,' was striding rapidly
along through the rain, increasing at
every step the distance between me and
my ill-fated property. There was only
one tiling to be done, and it was clear to
me that it must be done quickly, too.
P.cking up my skirts, I ran after that
man at top speed. I must have been an
impressive object, in my bedraggled and
hatlesa condition, but 1 )iÂ»Â«l no time to
think of that then. When I finally
reached him, I caught at his sleeve and
managed to gasp out :
' "Ob, sir â excuse me â but you've got my
bonnet!'
"He turnei.and judging from the ex
ppressiou on his face, I ima me he was
quite as much surprised as I had been a
minute or two before. He was a dignitied
old gentleman with kind-looking blue
eyes.
" "Your bonnet, madam? I â haye â yonr
â bonnet?' he repeated slowly, emphasiz
ing e.-.cu word, as if to make sure that he
bad heard me right.
"'lt's caught on your umbrella,' l ex
plained, feeling my face getting redder
every moment; 'you must have picked it
right up from my head as you passed me,
but I never felt it at all.'
"But this time we were both laughing
heartily over the absurdity of the affair,
hut 1 can tell you it will be a lesson to
m*. Never again will I go ont until I
have fastened my bat securely to my
head by every means Known lo'women."

FROST, SHARP AND HEAVY,
THREATENS THE FIGHT
Railroad Officials Say That Less Than iooo Persons
Will Go From Here and Only 500 Frcm
the East.
HAS DAN STUART BEEN
BITTEN ?
The Peculiar Agitation of the
"Examiner" Causes Wide
Distrust.
TEN DOLLARS WOULD HAVE
BEEN PLENTY FOR SEATS.
The Fight Promises to B; a Complete
Failure From the Standpoint
of Attendance.
After all that has been said for weeks
past of the prospective enormous attend
ance at the big prize-titrnt the affair prom
ises, in theatrical parlance, to be "'a frost."
From the latest and most reliable infor
mation to be obtained last night from rail
road officials it seems that less than 1000
persons have gone to Carson from all Cal
ifornia.
It was estimated also at railroad head
quarters that not more tnan 800 men had
come or were on their way from cities and
towns east of there.
The total exodus from San Francisco,
ail told, has been only 626. And this is
the city that was expected to send thou
sands to tne ring side. Thoughtful esti
mates had ra need oetween 2000 and 5000,
and others had gone much beyond these
figure 5 . The conservative had not pre
dicted Jess than 1500 from this City alone.
This State was counted on to furnish the
majority of the visitors to Dan Stuart's
arena. Very probably it has done so, but
with only a scant thousand. According
to the railroad companies the estimated
attendance from points outsile of Nevada
is considerably less than 2000. If that
little State, with its depleted population
of less Lhan 40,000 souls, equals the num
ber that have gone from California the
modern coliseum, with its seating capacity
of over 17,000, is destined to present rather
a bare appearance this forenoon about, tbe
time Comet t and Fitzsimmons enter the
ring.
Dan Stuart, the promoter of this fight
and the builder of the arena, is said to
have lost heavily on a similar venture in
El Paso, Tex. That he expected to even I
matters up at Carson is indicated by the
extensive preparations made for a great
crowd. Little by little, however, esti
mates of the number that would occupy
those seats have been reduced from 20,000
to 15,000. to 12,000, to 8000, to 6500, and
latterly to 5000.
The recent decision of Stuart to have
the three contests take place to-day would
indicate that he suspected tbe "frost," j
and shaped his plans to corral as big a
crowd as possible by combining all the
available attractions.
The kinetoscope privilege may prove to
be Stuart's saivation.
Anent tne facts given by the Southern
Pacific yesterday it was stated that the
crowd had dwindled away and fallen
down till but a mere vestige -of what was
to show up at Carson was actually ma
terializing. It was the impression that
Dan Stuart must bs very ill. He had con
structed a great amphitheater, and with
all the men be could pull together and
get to attend it threatened to cut a very
lonely tigure there.
."Almost nobody is going compared with
those who, it was ?aid, wouid go," said
General Superintendent Fillmore. "There
won't be 1000 people frbm all California,
and from the East an exceedingly small
number promise to be ou band. Where
they were miking of four or hve special
trains from Chicago a few weeks ago, oth
â¢rs from New York and hundreds of peo
ple from the South, there is next to no
ttody coming. The trains dwindled to
two or three cars. One noted Â«porting
man who had telegrapned us he would
bring 150 people finally was able to get
ill tbe people he could rake together into
a single car.
"That is the way it has been all over.
Dan Stuart must be sick, I should think.
The fact is, those seats were too high.
The idea of paying $40 for a seat is not to
be thought of. People can't stand it. At
'.his rate it would cost a man $100 to see
:he contest, and that's a, good deal of
money tliese times.
"If Stuart had sold those seats for $10
.nstead of ?40 he would have got a great
leal more money."
Other things have contributed to make
;he attendance small. An impression has
jot abroad that tue Examiner and Stuart
ire tocetber engineering the fight, and, as
;hey have no confidence in the Examiner's
methods in conducting a fight, they are
jierfectly willing to let it alone and call it
juits. There will no doubt be grief over
:he fiasco, but it appears that it will ac
:rue where it is needed the most. It is no
wonder that people have decided to stay
it home and hold on to their money.
OAKLAND REDEEMS ITSELF
Mot Enough Carson Passengers to
Fill a Special Train.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broauway, March 16. \
Oakland has redeemed itself. There are
lot enough citizens who wish to see a
>rizÂ«-fight withiu her borders to fill a spe
lial train.
Although a goodly company of the
porting fraternity and a few who wouid
eel aggrieved if they were classed with
hat eiement left this afternoon for Car
on there was nothing like the exodus
bat was anticipated. There is. however,
. little ioker somewhere in the woodpile,
or many professional and business men
.r,e missing this evening from their usual
taunts, and as they have been talking
onsiderably of their interest in to-mor
â ow's battle the inference to be drawn
Irani their absence is at least suspicious.
There was to have been a special train
>f day coaches run from the pier for the
iccommodation of those who desired to
tiake a daylight trip, but it failed to move
ait owing to a lack of patrons. From this
t is evident that the Oaklanders who de
dred to be protected from the pnblic gaze
lave gone to Carson by the side streets, as
it were, or have gone ahead and will board
the through trains at wav stations.
This morning a train of thirteen day
coaches was taken to the pier to be used
as a special, but when the time came to
start there were only twenty-five passen
gers on hand. They were quickly gath
ered into one car. which was attached to
a fÂ»st engine, which sped away to over
haul tho regular overland train, so that
tbe expense of a special would be avoided.
At 5 o'clock tins evening the Ja*t special
left the pier. James Flood and party left
in the millionaire's private car Del Monie,
which wa- attached to the special, as was
also a car for the railroad agents and their
incnds. The Bohemian Club and the
Pacific Club eaca had a special car, and
the Oakland contingent had five cars. As
a report reached the pier that the drink
ing water at Nevada is of very poor quality
the dining-car G. W. Pierce was stocked
with enough, refreshments, both liquid
and soiid, to last both ways.
This train is due at Carson at 8 o'clock
to-morrow morning. In the train were
twoimoty cars, and when it stopped at
the racetrack a large contingent got on
board as speedily as possib c and the two
cars were rapidly filled. Thi* somewhat
solved the secretof why so lew Oskland
ers were .Â«,een at the pier. It would be an
outrage or. humanity to publish the list
of passengers, and consequently those in
charge of the train, when asked who they
were carrying, calmly replied that they
were nearly all strangers. As a matter of
fact the Oakland contingent looked like
the busiest part of Broadway packed into
five cars,
FEW MEN START TO WORK
Oaly Half Those Accepted Came
Yesterday to the Boule
vard.
Improved Order of R n d M?n to Give
the Movement a Benefit
March 24.
The applications for work on the boule
vard have reached 1500, but of those men
already recommended as particularly
worthy few have shown up for work.
Thirty whose tickets were ready yester
day morning failed to appear at the Le:d
esdorff-street office for them. Only eigh
teen men presented themselves to Super
intendent Eagen to begin the actual con
struction out beyond the park, although
thirty could have been employed at once.
About hfiy more tickets for workerÃ
were issued last ni.-ht to occupants of the
old r.rmory on Howard street, where the
organized unemployed hold forth. It is
expected that 100 more persons including
these will be given an opportunity to be
; gin this morning to earn something on
! the boulevard.
Some little apprehension was created by
a notice posted yesterday on Mayor Bu
tro's property warning persons 10 keep off
from that particular bit ot land which it
is understood he has given for the boule
vard. It seems he has not yet signed the
deed, and that ne suspects that the water
company is getting the better of tne prop
osition. The construction committee de
cided not to take the notice seriously, and
when that point is reached the men will
go right on witn the proposed roadway.
Another benefit to the boulevard fund
wa< decided upon last night. It will be
given by the Improved Order of Red Men
upon the evening of March '2-i at Metro
politan Temple. The proersmrae will
consist of mnsical and literary numbers.
There will be a lecture by Professor
Frank J. Polley of Stanford University
upon the "Aborigines of the American
Continent," and vocal music by Signor
Bolini and by tbe Knickerbocker quartet,
specialty work by tne three Mohr
brothers and other volunteer talent prom
ised by the proprietors of the Orpbeum.
The organized unemployed will help to
advertise the entertainment. Last night
they again discussed the advisability of
incorporating so as to have a permanent
home maintained by monthly dues and
able to support a man at $2 a week on
credit when he is out of work.
EPWOETH LEAGZJEHS.

FLAMES FLAPPED
AMID MACHINERY
Two Wood- Working Shops
Have Gone Up in
Smoke.
Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars'
Worth Burned in Two
Hours.
Sone Insurance Was Carried, but the
Loss Will Be a Severe
One.
The Pacific Planing-mill?, near Sixth
and Berry street*, and the Pacific Wooden
ware and Cooperage Company wÂ«re de
stroyed by fire last evening, and only by
bard work was the surrounding property
saved from a similar fate.
Tbe fire started, so far as can be learned,
in the rear of the Pacific Planing-mills,
and the flames were first seen bursting
through the roof beside the smokestack.
It was supposed to have started in the
boiler-room.
J. T. Daniels, the night watchman, and
Policeman M. T. Hurley saw tiie fire first,
and turned ia the alarm. Before the de
partment arrived the combustible mate
rials in tbe mill had got well started, and
despite every effort the fire spread to tbe
cooper-shops adjoining.
There the names were got under control,
but not belore both buildings had been
burned clear through to Channel street,
and several vessels lying at the wharves
there had been more or less damaged.
The first alarm went in from box 156 at
10:45 and within ten minutes after the
second followed. It was a hard tire to deal
with, and fears were at one time feit that
the large warehouse on tbe corner of Sixth
and Berry, belonging to the Woodenware
and Cooperage Company, would be
burned.
The planing-mill was owned by A. Han
son. With the machinery, building and
stock, his loss is estimated at at least
$â¢-'5,000, of which $15,000 is covered by in
surance.
The cooperage company is owned by a
syndicate, of which Henry P. Dodge is
president It fared much worse. A great
deal of valuable machinery was destroyed,
besides a large stock, and it was stated
that $50,000 would barely cover tue io3Â».
The company carried $20,000 insurance.
The steam schooner Noyo iving at the
wharf was afire once, but she was towed
out of harm's way as soon as possible.
The lumbar scows Annie Eliza and No. 7
were damaged slightly, the scow Nellie
Mich was scorched to the extent of $400
and the Lime Point sustained a damage
of $50.
B-yond the supposition that it started
in the boiler-room nothing is known of
the origin of the fire. At 12:15 the fire
was out.
John Valentine, who lives in Mont
gomery's Hotel, on Second street, jumped
on a hosecart to ko to the fire. He was
ordered off at Fourth and Townsend
streets, and in jumping off begot in tne
way of truck '_'. He was knocked down
and seriously injured. At the Receiving
Hospital it was found that his left thigh
bone was fractured and he had sustained
abrasions and contusions of his limbs
and other injuries.
MODERN MUSIC DRAMA
San Francisco Takes Very
Kindly to Reyer's Opera
"Sigurd."
Wagneriam G> Inio Rap'ures Over
the Beauty of the Scoreâ Fine
Costuming.
Modern musical drama of the later
Wagnerian type is practically an un
known art in San Francisco, but last
night the French Opera Company per
formed the very up-to-date work,
"Sigurd," for the first time here, and
if applause goes for anything the audi
ence took to it as kindly as a duck takes
to wat-r.
"Sieurd" has been in the repertory of
the Paris Grand Opera for about ten
years, but so far it has made uo headway
on this sine of the Atlantic. The com
poser, Ernest Iteyer, has broken away
from old traditions as completely as
Wagner did.
There are no morceaux that can be en
cored. In the style of the early Verdi
school everything is linked together in the
score, for, like ttie Bayreuth master,RÂ»yer
has tried to give bit work all the cohesion
possible. Reyer no doubt owes something
to Gluclc and the German romantic writ
ers, such as Weber, but lie has borrowed
the fully doveloped use of leit-rnotives
from Wagner, and has orchestrated them '
very fully and richly.
Tnere was a great deal of orchestra last
night, and though M. Nicosias, the chef
d'orcbestra, did bis best to prevent the
orchestral score from becoming blatant
the California Theater is such a bonbon
box of a place for music drama the vocal
score would no doubt have been more
enjoyed had it been possible to have the
orchestra deep down out of sight and par
tially muffled by distance.
The suoject of "Sigurd" is taken from
the Nibelungen, thai collection of legends
that furnished Wagner with his famous
tetralogie. There is a strong family like
nes\ between the libretto ot "Sigurd" and
those of "Siegfried" and "The Dusk of
the Gods/ but the French librettists have
chanued the motive for the awakening of
tlie Walkyrie. In "Siegfried" the hero
delivers Brunehilde for himself, becomes
her husband and forgets her immediately
afterward, thanks to the fatal draught of
the traitor Hagon. In "Sigurd" he only
awakens the Walkyrie for his friend
Guiither, whose sister Hilda he loves.
The libretto of Reyer's music drama was
compos d by Dv Locle and Blau. So much
has been written Ã¼boct the plot during the
last week that it is scarcely necessary to
repeat it in detail.
"Sigurd" grew upon the bearers as they
became familiar with the {"it-motives, and
no doubt a greater familiarity with the
work would reveal many more pleasing
themes. There is nothing the average
opera audience loves more than a tune,
and in spite of the fact that the first act
ends in some line martial-sounding music,
the recitatives are long and monotonous
and little or no melody was apparent in
the whole act.
The orchestral prelude to the second
act contains a strongly marked theme,
which at one time aroused the flagging
attention of the audience. This attention
never waned all through the act, which .
contains some exceedingly beautiful
music.
TheHicn Prest, a part excellently taken
(by Freicne, has sotue fascinating lines in
the forest scene, and the orchestra accom
paniment is most effectivp. SÂ«me of the
choruses in this scene are very fine.
Massart was the tenor, and when left
alone by the altar in t c forest scene he had
an exquisite aria which deservedly brought
down the house. Ii was very Wagnerian,
of ihe genre of the "Prize Song" from the
"Meistersingers," and even on a first hear
ing its beauty was very apparent, par
ticularly as Massart sang it in splendid
style.
Ttie scene where Brunebilde is awak
ened from her long sleep suffers by com>
parison with the same scene in Wagner's
"Siegfried." Dramatically speaking, the
fact that Sigurd has his lace hidden and
is almost mute mars tne action. Brune
bilde, however, has some fine lines, es
pecially the "0 mon Sauveur Silencieux,'
and although Mme. Foedor is not ca*t
in a heroic enough mold to make an
ideal Walkyrie she sang and acted very
acceptably and was heartily applauded.
Reyer awakens Brunehilde twice, thÂ«
second time in Gunther's bere, where
Guntber falsely asserts i.c is her deliverer
and claims her for his wife. Henri Albers.
who made a splendid Guntber. was in
tensely dramatic, both vocally and his
trionically, in this scene, and Mme.Foedor
seconded him well. In the second tableau
of the third act Hagen (Athes) has some
fine lines to sing.
The last act is somewhat somber, bat
there is very poetical music in the scene
between Brunehilde and Sigurd.
Taken altogether the casi was uooa.
Massard, who seems to excel in heroic
roles, made a good Sigurd, though he
played almost as much to the audience as
if he had been singing in a ballad opera.
Henri Albers, who is an artist in every
thing he undertakes. wa>t an irreproachable
Gunther. Mme. Fremeau was good as
Uta and Athes did well as Hasten.
Mme. Berthet is too doll-like in ap
pearance and acting and too light of vcice
to make a very satisfactory Hilda, but she
sung sweetly. The cuoruses were fairly
good.
"Sigurd" was brilliantly costumed, and
some of the pictures presented were ex
ceedingly artistic and imposing.
There is no possibility that Reyer's
music will be sung or whistled in the
streets, but people wtio incline to Wagner
ism in their tastes are sure to support it
heartily if it be given again.

BUTTONS MADÂ£ OF MILK.
The Dairy Will Also Supply Combs,
r.ru.h Handle* and Kilihird Kails.
For a long time buttons and other arti
cles for which bone is generally used have
been made from congealed blood pur
chased by the button-makers at the
slaughter- houses and treated with some
substance that hardened it to the suffi
cient consistency. From blood to milk is
a long remove, but the s>anie articles that
are ir.ade from blood can be made from
milk by a process invented by an English
man named James Callander and soon to
be introduced into this country.
The milk used is the skim milk that is
of little use for domestic purposes and can
be obtained very cheaply. It is the nuik
that remains after the cream has been
skimmed off. The process of turning this
liquid into buttons, poolbalis, combs,
backs of hair brushes and aim lar articles
consists, first, of straining the milk through
a cloth, in order to remove every vestige
of cream, and then mixing it with a suu
stance the ingredients of which are a se
cret of the inventor nnd compressing it.
At the end of three days the substance is
as solid as celluloid, and is ready 10 be cut
and shaped in any way the manufacturer
wishes.
At present a factory in Holland is en
gaged in fashioning the hardened milk
into various articles, buttons being the
chief. The buttons made in this peculiar
way differ very little in appearance from
ordinary bone buttons. They are a creamy
white in appearance, but can be colored
black or red or any other color by mixing
the coloring matter with the milk before
the hardening process begins. They are
said to possess advantages over the bone
and celluloid article in being iess brittle
and ics liable to chip. For mis reason
the billiard balls and pool balls which
have been ma >c in England from this sub
stance have found favor where a cheap ball
is required instead of the expensive ivory
onas.
For combs the milk substance has been
found to be especially v>ell adapted, as it
is smooth and delicate to the touch, and
derives from its creamy origin a glowy
surface that is just the thing for combs.
In the same way it is a good substitute
lor ivory in billiard and pool balls.
The great difficulty the inventor had to
overcome, and which he grappled with un
successfully for seven years before lie hit
upon the right plan, was to keep the color
of the substance of a uniform shade. Ac
cording to Mr. .1. R. Burdoch of Brooklyn,
who has known the inventor for many
years, tho early experiments with m.lk
buttons always resulted in tha turning out
of a substance hard enoujrh, to be sure,
but breaking out in spots of yellow, like
freckles on a country boy.â New York

BOOK AND PRIEST
CALLED USELESS
Dharmapala, the Buddhist,
Lectures to Theoso
phists.
Nirvana Defined as the Union of
the Individual With the
Infinite.
W.sdom Without Love Said to Be Im
possible in the Viry Nature of
the Thin?.
H. Dharmapala, the Buddhist monk,
lectured last night to a select audience in
Native Sons' Hall, under the auspices of
Golden Gate Lodge of the Theosophical
Society, on the subjsct of "The Growth of
Spirituality."
The lecturer advanced the ides that
ignorance is the fundamental cause of all
misery. The notion of illusion he took to
be that which is not fixed or immortal.
"Nirvana," he said, "is the separation
of the soul and the body and the union of
the individual with the infinite. It is to be
realized in life and is not an after stat*.
"I norance consists in not i r >perly urÂ«
derstanding the laws of nature. Neither
is speculation spiritual growth, but rather
experience. Religious life does in no sense
depend upon dogmas, but upon experi
ence.
"Truths are things that stand on self
evident facts. They do not require the
authority of priests.
".Regulation of the mental faculties is
the path of progress and final liberation.
Man is the concentration of actions of
wnich self is the embodiment."
The speaker here used the simile of a
mother's love for her child, which ex
prcts no reward for its labor, as a guid
ance to all human action. Some time
was spent in dwelling on the good that
would come to humanity if all our actions
were dictated by a spirit of unselfishness,
and c included as follows :
"Yon cannot have wisdom without love.
Every thoueht should be one of love and
compassion. No book or priest is neces
sary to one who really wishes to lead a
religious lite; but be roust never be in
acdve, never lose vigilance.
"If a man continue thus he will in
time drink deep of the stream that flows
by immortality's shrine, and sinning will
become to his pure mind an impossi
bility."
AN EXPENSIVE WAR HISTOBY.
It Will Cost Over Three Million Dollars
Uefore It la Completed.
The most expensive book that was ever
published in the world is the official his
tory oi the War of the Rebellion, which is
now issued by the Government of the
United States at a cost up to date of
$2,334 328. Of this amount $1,184,291 has
been paid for printing and binding. The
remainder was expended for salaries, rent,
stationery and other contingent and mis
cellaneous expenses, and for the purchase
of records from private individuals. It
wil require at, least three years longer and
an appropriation of perhaps $600,000 to
â¢ complete the work, so that the total cost
â¢will undouotediy reach nearly $3,000,000.
It will consist of 112 volume*, inciudin >
an index and an atias, which contains ITS
plates and maps, illustrating the import
ant battles of the war, campaigns, routes
of march, plans of forts and photographs

v Dear Sir.â cannot say enough for yonr," Gol- ,
i den Medical Discovery." For two years my little A
boy suffered with lung trouble â taking la- 4
grippe; second | intermittent fever: , third, lung"
trouble. For two years he coughed. The phy-
sician could do no good and I thought he must *,
I die. I was told to try Dr. Pierces Golden Mcd-
f ical Discovery.'- 1 did, and before he had taken
one bottle he began to mend and could eat a
little. When he had taken four bottles lie waa
well and now is as stout as before. '.'"
