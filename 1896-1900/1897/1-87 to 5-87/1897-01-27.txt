Big Fire.
John Wanamaker Saves His
Establishment by His o<vn
Private Brigade.
Intensely Cold Weather Interferes
With the Efforts of the F.iemen
to Check the Confl gration.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.., Jan. 26.â One of
' most destructive fires that have visited
tiiia city in recent years broke out shortly
before 7 o'clock this morning in the whole
sale and retail grocery-stora of Hanscom
Brothers, 1317 Market street. This firm
occupied a portion of the larce building of
Hirsch & Brothers, umbrella manufac
turers, which extended from 1309 to 1317
Market street.
The flames spread rapidly throughout
the building and to the adjoining proper
ties all of which were occupied by mer
cantile establishments. The location is
in the heart of the city, and diractly op
posite the Hirsch building was the exten
sive and famous establishment of John
Wanamaker, and within a few hunered
yards stands the spacious City Hall.
In addition to the thousand or more
employes of Wanamaker's, wnich include
several hundred girls, there were many
thousand other toilers at (he time moviig
toward thsir respective places of business,
and the result was that the streets in the
vicinity socn became choked with im
mense surginc crowds. The proximity of
the City Hall also adued to the crowd the
great army of city clerks and other
officials.
Mayor Warwick, Director of Public
Works Thompson and other executive
officers at onre began the direction of the
police and riremen. The weather was in
tensely cold, and this in 'a measure de
terred the efforts of the firemen in check
ing the flames. The Wanamaker estab
lishment was at one time in flames on the
Market-street front, but a detail oF fire
men was quickly put to work on the
building and soon checked the progress of
the fire there. The entire block on the
south side of Market street from Thir
teenth to Juniper and from Market to
Filbert is practically in ruins. .
The fire started in a bakery which was
. cS ty Hanhcoio Bios, in connection
:h their grocery-store, and which -was
-ocated in the basement thereof. Hans
com Bros, occupied a portion ot the lower
floor and basement of the six-story build
ing used by Hirsch Bros., extensive um
brella manufacturers, and the flames were
first seen by an employe of the latter firm.
Two employes of the bakery, dazed from
the effects of the smoke, were rescued and
taken to a drugstore which was subse
quently destroyed. The Hirsch building
was also occupied by Dennett's restau
rant, where thirty waitresses were em
ployed, ail of whom escaped in safety.
Hirsch Bros, utilized a portion of the
lower part of the structure and ail of the
upper stories as a salesroom and manu
factory, nearly 500 hands, a large per
centage of them women and girls, being
employed.
Owinsr to the early hour, however, but
six workmen were in the place and they
left before the fie became general. The
intensely cold weather and a high wind
was a barrier to the riremen, and although
six Blarms were sonnded, and about ail
of the city's fire apparatus soon appeared
on the scene, the flames spread with
alarming rapidity. In half an hour the
whole block of business establishments
from Thirteenth to Juniper and Market
to Filbert streets were in danger of des
truction. The fireman worked heroically,
but their efforts were futile. The spray
from the streams of water fell on them
and froze, huge icicles were formed on the
walls and roof of t!ie burning structures.
AtÃo'ciockit was clearly evident that
the block was doomed, and some atten
tion was turned to surrounding property.
At this time the wind carried the blazing
embers across tc Wanamaker's store and
the clock tower was soon ablaze.
The fire engines did not have sufficient
force to send the water to the tower, and
alter burning some minutes it fell. The
lire iher; communicated to the roof, but it
â < was held in check, and in comparatively
little time was practically extinguished.
The Market-street front of the store was
badly damaged.
At 9 o'clock, while the flames were Rt
their height, Chief of the Fire Department
Baxter sent two engines to the vicinity of
Filbert and Juniper streets, and several
lines of hose were run into Silver street, a
small thoroughiare between Market and
Filbert streets, and directly in the rear of
the Market-street properties. The firemen
Btationed there did efficient work to pre
vent the flames from spreading to the
building occupied by the Dunlap Printing
Company and the Collins Carriage Com
pany. The crowd saw the walls totier,
and cried for the firemen to run for their
lives.
The brave and ice-covered workers
Btarted lo run. but two of them were
struck by the debris and severely hurt.
The Market-street front of the Hirsch
building fell at about 8:30 o'clock, but no
one was hurt. The flames raged fiercely
nnti! 11 o'clock, when they were under
control. The HirsCh building was owned
by the Henry C. Gibson estate. The
streets in the vicinity were covered w'th
ice, and the trolley and otber wires m the
vicinity were broken down. The efficient
police reguiations, however, in keeping
the crowd at a distance prevented possible
accident? by contact with wVes.
Mr. Wanamaker carries his own insur
t ance. When it was feared that his estab
lishment would also be doomed, 600 of the
employes were organized into brigades
and under Mr. Wanamaker's personal
direction they beean preparing for the
worst. The fire was confined to the roof
and tower, however, because of the cour
ageous work of the firemen.
The lunchrooms in the establishment
were thrown open to the firemen and me ,

employes, and hot coffee was served to
the fire-workers. John A. Felt, who was
employed at Ivins, Deitz & Magee's car
pet-store, 1217 Market street, hall a block
from the scene of the fire, dropped dead
this morning. While the flames were
raging the work of carrying out goods was
begun, and it was while assisting in this
work that Felt dropped dead.
In the midst of the intense excitement
and while nearly all the firemen were en
gaged at the great conflagrations, two
alarms came from other sections of the
city. One at 10:05 o'clock came from
Archer and Pine streets, and another at
10:25 came from Franklin and Callowhill.
These fires, however, were extinguished
with slight damage.
Mrs. Hall, janitor of the building 1312
Filbert street occupied the fourth story
back room with her two children, Mary
aged 4 years and Adam aged 2 years. All
were asleep when the fire was discovered
anu were aroused just in time to save their
lives.
The two firemen who were injured by
the falling walls while engaged in hghl- <
ing the fire from Filbert street were Wil
liam J. Gorman aged 32 years, assistant
loreman of company No. 1, and Frank
Piper, 36 years of age, a hoseraan. Gor
man was severely injured abont the head
and burned on the neck by flying embers, !
and Piper was struck on the back by fall- j
ing bricks and had his shoulder contused.
Several other firemen were overcome by
the smoke and stili others were affected by
the intense cold and had to be taken to
hospitals for treatment. Every hospital
in the city sent an ambulance to the scene
of the fire and many representatives of
the medical emergency corps were on the
ground prepared to render medical aid.
The principal losers are: Hirsch &
Bros., umbrellas; Hansconi Bros., grocers,
and A. W. Dennett, restaurant, 1309 to
1317 Market street, buiiding total loss:
loss on buildings and contents, $300,000.
The loss to the three tenants and business
is fully covered by insurance.
The building 1319 Market street, occu
pied by Henry Pium & Bros., loss on
building and contents, $250,000; fully cov
ered by insurance. The Dunlap building,
1306 to 1310 Filbert street, owned by John
Wanamaker; loss on building, $50,000;
insurance, $35,000. The building was oc
cupied by numerous tenants, the principal
losers among whom are the Dunlap Print
ing Company, whose loss is covered by an
insurance of $68,000; the Wilbur Printing
Company, loss covered by an insurance of
$10,000; the Collins Carriage Company,
loss $10,000; fully covered by insurance;

these were small buildings, and were
badly gutted, but the loss was pretty well
covered by insurance. These buildings
were occupied mostly by small tenants in
a small line of business, and most of them
carried lines of insurance nearly sufficient
to cover their losses. The losses were dis
tributed among so many that only an
approximate idea of the tdtal loss could be
gathered, but the greater part is covered
by insurance. The total loss will probably
not exceed $1,000,000.
FORTY FIRES IS CHICAGO.
One Was of a Very Serious Aature, and
Ten Persons Were Injured.
CHICAGO, li-1., Jan. 26.â During a de
structive tire in the 6-story structure at
196. 198, 200 and 202 Monroe street, occu
pied exclusively by wholesale firms, ten
persons were seriously injured, seven of
i whom were firemen. Three of them will
probably die.

caught under falling wall, both legs broken
and breast crushed, will probably die;
William J. Workaman, fireman, caught
under the wall, back injured and hip in
jured, may die; James Shanahan, fire
man, internally injured aad spise hurt,
may die; Jerry Kedcroit. fireman, legs se
riously crushed by falling wall; Patrick
Ryan, fireman, struck by failing wall, in
ternal injuries and ankle crushed, will re

almost entirely destroyed by the flames,
I and th? loss is estimated at not less than
I $330,0C0. The building alone, the prop

The atock3 of these various concerns are
entirely lost. The losses are fully covered
by insurance. â¢
The fire originated on the first floor of
the butlding, which was occupied by
Wurzberger Bros. When discovered flames
were bursting from a dozen windows, and
in a few moments the west half of the
building was enveloped in flames. A lire
wall divided the buildings, but only
afforded a temporary barrier to the flames.
The flames spread rapidly over the struc
ture.

Legislators Asked to Pass a Bill That
Will Help Commerce at
This Port
â¢ SACRAMENTO, CAi.., Jan. 23.â
was a great day for tbe San Francisco
committee on commerce sent here to pre
sent the needs of San â¢ Francisco, in the
matter of pilotage reforms before the joint
Commerce Committee of the Legislature.
The session lasted two hours and a half,
and the passage of each, minute percepti
bly strengthened the position of the San
Francisco commercial delegation. â¢ -
Hugh Craig acted as spokesman for his
colleagues and was ably seconded by C. E.
Naylor. While .no definite action was
taken by the , Legislative committee to
night, the evidence in the shape of facts
and figures presented by Craig and his
associates appeared so striking that it was
only a sense of fairness to the pilots and
Pilot Commissioners that prevented the
committee from at once deciding to recom
mend the reform measure for passage. .
The first: bill considered was that ap
propriating $75,000 for the construction
and equipment of a fireboat with a speed
of not less than twenty statute miles per
hour, a pumping capacity of not less than
8000 gallons per minute and a draught of
not more than seven feet when loaded and
equipped for service.
It was explained shat the light; draught
and high speed were necessary in order
that the fireboat might be available for
use at Stockton and Sacramento and other
inland points where it might be of service.
It was decided to report the bill favorably.
Senator Gleaves' measure relative to
pilots, Pilot Commissioners and pilotage
was next considered. The bill reduces the
number of Pilot Commissioners at San
Francisco from three to one, and the Com
missioner, as well as the pilots appointed
by. him, ; is required to hold certificates
from the board of examiners of the Cham
ber of Commerce. It further provides for
two classes of pilots, general and special.
â¢The former are those to be directly carter
control of the Pilot Commissioner, while
masters and mates of American ships and
masters of .tugboats are to be known as
special pilots. The license fee is fixed at
$10 per annum, j and .the j license can be
renewed from year to year by the payment
of $2 50 for each renewal. 'r r>>
it was when the section referring to the
compensation of pilots came under dis
cussion that . general interest became
aroused. This section reads as follows: j
Every general pilot of the harbors of San
Francisco, Mare Island,' Vallejo and Benicla
must render an account each day, or as often
as practicable,, to the Pilot Commissioner, of
each and all vessels to which or for which ho
has rendered service, and the pilotage there
for must be charged up and collected by the
said Commissioner, who shall deposit the same
with the State Treasurer. The Commissioner
shall draw by warrant upon the State Treas
urer, specifying the purpose, for the necessary
expenses of : the pilots, boats and office ex
penses, not to exceed $200 per month salary
for each general pilot licensed and actually
rendering services that produce an income
equal to such salary $200 per month saiary
tor the Commissioner; $100 per month for the
secretary; $40 per month rent and sundries,
and $500 per month for the use, maintenance
and repair of each pilot boat in actual service,
not to exceed four. Any surplus remaining
shall go to the State public school funa.
After this had been read Hugh Craig
read from a communication which had
been received - irom the secretary of the
Pilot Commissioners. This gave a review
of the pilot business in and out of the
harbor of San Francisco for the past
fifteen years. This showed that the four
pilot-boats now in service at San Francisco
were the private property of the pilots
and that their average cost was about
$18,000, and -that the average monthly
earnings of each of the twenty pilots en
gaged in the service was $329 88. He
showed farther 'from the statement re
ceived from the Pilot Commissioners that
these earnings were made after rebates
amounting to nearly one-half of the gross
earnings were made to local shipowners.
This discriminaiion, he averred, was made
in order to retain the friendship and aid
of the San Francisco shipowners when
necessity such as the present occasion cre
ated arose for their kindly services.
In response to some questions by Sena
tor Braunhart, a member of the Senate
Committee on Commerce, â  Craig stated
that ample provision was made in the
measure under consideration for the valu
able services of the pilots by paying them
a salary of $200 a month, and that ample
returns were made them for the money
they had invested in their pilot- boats by
allowing them $6000 a year for each boat.
This allowance, he stated, gave them a net
return of $2400 a year on an investment of
$18,000. ' '' : Bi^Â£ft
Senator Braunhart still sought enlight
enment. He stated that several times be
fore similar measures had been before the
Legislature,' but each time they had failed
of passage. He explained that such meas
ures were generally referred to by a pe
culiar term by the press and no member
cared to be under suspicion of favoring
such a measure. He asked Craig ' why
such a bill was now again submitted, in
view of the past history of its prede
cessors. "'â¢ ; â¢â 
In his sweetest tones and manner Craig
re plied that never, before had tbe best
co mmercial element of San Francisco had
an opportunity of applying to such an in
telligent and able body of < legislators.
When the -laugh; at Braunhart's expense
had subsided Craig further explained that
there. was really no need for; pilots ' in ;t he
harbor. of; San f Francisco.. He said the
harbor was -so well s guarded by fi lights
and signals that . the insurance people
would charge no more for covering a ves
sel that did not engage a pilot than for
one that did. .:-. : -â ;..( 'â¢ '; â  â¢:.', ,"f
C. E. Naylor said that in his opinion
YOUNG MR. MAHONEY of San Francisco and His Contested
Seat.
there should be free competition in the
pilotage business at the port of San Fran
cisco, and that if this was brought about
there would be a clear saving of $78,000 to
the State. He added that the measure
under consideration was in reality a con
cession to the pilots.
Georee E. Plumer, who has been man
ager of six vessels for fifteen years, said
that only on three occasions did any of
his vessels have to employ a pilot, and
that yet he had been compelled 10 pay
large sums annually to the pilots for
services which they had never performed.
C. E. Nay lor followed this line of argu
ment by stating that he bad letters from
San Francisco ship-owners, showing that
they had paid from $1100 to $19,000 a year
lor compulsory pilotage, and for services
which had never been performed.. He de
clared that in this showing the present
law would certainly be declared to be un
constitutional, if brought to a test.'
Craig again took up the argument, when
the following section was under considera
tion:
The following shall be the rates of pilotage
into or out of the harbor of San Francisco: All
vessel 8 under 500 tons, $3 per foot draught;
all vessels over 500 tons, $3 per foot draught,
and 2 cents per ton for each and every ton
, net registered measurement, in all casts
where Inward-bound vessels are not spoken
until inside the bar the rates of pilotage above
provided shall be reduced 50 per cent. Any
vessel, the master or mate of which holds a
special pilot's license and which displays the
requisite signal, or that is in tow of a steam
tugboat, the master of which is a licensed spe
cial pilot, or that is engaged in the whaling or
fishing trades, shall be exempt from all pilot
age at any port in this State, unless a general
Dilot be actually emgoyed, and all provisions
of law to the contrary are hereby repealed.
This he declared was the most im
portant clause in the whole bill, and was
designed to free the commerce of San
Francisco from the incubus which now
oppressed it and which for many years
past has driven the foreign trade that
rightfully belonged to San Francisco to
otber ports.
The present rates of pilotage are $5 per
foot draught for vessels under 500 tons,
and $5 per foot draught and 4 cents per
ton for each ton net registered measure
ment for vessels over 500 tons. He con
cluded by explaining the great saving that
would result from the enforcement of this
section, by cheapening the cost of actual
pilotage service and by doing away with
pilotage altogether where a vessel was
being towed in by a tugboat and where
the master or mate of a vessel held a spe
cial licence as pilot.
After all who desired had been heard
Senator Mahoney moved that the whole
matter lie over until to-morrow night at 8
o'clock, in order to give the Pilot Com
missioners a ciiance to be heard. The
motion was carried.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28.â The
matter ot providing for ihe reorganization
of future sessions of the Assembly was
made the subject of a li7ely debate in the
House this morning. It came up on the
special orders when Chynoweth's bill was
reached. The bill limited the number of
attaches to be employed on prelimi
nary organization. The reading of the
bill was the signal for a member, once
well known as a Democrat but who a
short time ago drifted into oblivion on
the mud scow of Populism, to rise and
move an impossible amendment for toe
purpose of being in harmony with his
Quixotic environment.
Mehckof Los Angeles, a newspaper man
whose voice ene:.li aloud in the wilderness
of the Mojave desert near Laucas.ter, op
posed the amendment. "The law as it
stands," he said, "may be good enough
for Populists, but it is not good enough
ior Republicans. Tne gentleman says
that there is no need of temporary or
ganization. Whether that be s.o or not,
we find in looking over the history of past
sessions of the Legislature that there have
been times when for weeks aud nearly a
month the temporary organization waa
prolonged. At the time of Mr. Stanford's
election to the United States Senate we
know that the temporary organization
was held for seventeen days, and there
have been other times when it was even
impossible to organize at aIL This bill
provides for twenty-four attaches in the
Assembly. They are absolutely needed to
carry on the business of tne House."
Mr. Waymire said that the bill would
give to the organization of the Assembly
ample power in the selection of its clerics
and other officers. The bill would pre
vent abuses such as bad been noted in the
past.
The object of the bill, Valentine said,
was to take the matter out of tbe bands
of the Speaker.
'â¢The power of appointing the attaches
should be taken out of the hands of the
Speaker," continued Valentine, "because
it was a power that was likely to be
abused. It had been abused two years
ago and it had been abused at this session.
The selection of the attaches by the chief
clerk is wrong in principle and pernicious
in practice. The Assembly should ap
point its own employes. We don't need a
wholearmy of temporary and permanent
attaches for the use of the temporary or
ganization."
Chynoweth took the floor and in bis
most impressive manner begged the House
to vote down the amendment. The
amendment would leave the law exactly
as it was, and would allow the Legislature
at tne next session to repeat the scandals
which have agitated the present session.
On motion of Xreacy the whole subject
matter and all tbe bills relating thereto
were referred to the committee.
There was Duckworth talk in the air all
the morning and a disquieting rumor that
at least two members of the committee
were in favor of conducting the investiga
tion in the dark. There was more than
rumor in it, as the newspaper corre
spondents learned, and a committee of
reporters waited upon Speaker Coombs
and asked him whether be haa agreed
that the proceedings should be of the
star-chamber whitewash variety, and he
replied that he would not consent to have
the investigation held in any but a public
manner, and furthermore, that he would
use all the influence in his power to have
the investigation held with open doors.
The committee of investigation met at
3p. m.. Judge Waymire presiding. Chyn
oweth produced the temporary roll, and
on r equest of Emnions the committee
authorized the chairman to issue a
subpena for S. J. Duckworth to appear
and produce all written requests and other
evidence, documenary and otherwise,
bearing upon the matter of the appoint
ment of temporary employes.
R. R. Duckworth announced that bis
brother was still confined to his bed ana
unable to appear; that his physician had
consented that he might go out to-morrow
for exercise, and that if strong enough at
that time he would attend the meeting.
The subpena accordingly was issued sub
ject to the certificate of Mr. Duckworth's
physician.
North of Alameda was called to the
stand and said that lie bad been informed
that among the papers in his possession
was a document containing a list of ap
pointees in Duckworth's own handwriting.
Chynoweth suggested that tue witness
sihould produce the papers instead of tell
ing the committee of what he bad been
informed, and North replied that the
papers were under his control, locked in a
safe uptown. He aked that he should be
subpenaed to produce the papers, be not
desirinÂ«r to volunteer any evidence.
Belshaw of Contra Costa came next.

him was read by Chynoweth. It was to
the effect that three of Duckworth's em
ployes had not been present in Sacra
mento on the day of the temporary or
ganization, but on the contrary were in
Monterey. iJelshaw said that he did not
know Thomas Doud, the writer of the let
ter, and had never seen the original roll.
Breiling of Alameda identified the tem
porary roll. He said that he had asked Duck
worth to assist him in raakine up the roll.
Duckworth told him to copy tbe names of
attaches out of the journal and to allow
them seven days' pay; that such had been
the course pursued by the Legislature two
years ago. The witness employed Ed J.
Smith and R. R. Duckworth to assist him
in making up the roll, and they found
i hat there was a typographical error.
There were several names of persons ap
pointed by the chief clerk that had
been omitted from the journal by a mis
take of the printer. It was found that
the name of M. A. Kearney was on the
list and not in the journal as printed.
Several other errors of the same kind
were also f und.
Breiling proceeded to teli how he had
withdrawn the whole report for further
consideration by the committee. On
January 5 the report as corrected was
printed in tbe journal. It was generally
understood that the attaches on the list
had performed the duties for which they
were paid. The Committee on Mileage
made no investigation; they were there
simply to fix the mileage without Daying
any regard to the salaries.
The witness did not authorize anybody
to write the name of Ella Bateman on the
report. She was the wife of Andy
Brand). He did not know who put the
name on the list/
Emmons asked: "You have stated that
Duckwor.h told you to put some addi
tional names on because there was some
kicking on account ot certain parties not
having been taken care of."
"He told me," replied Breiling, "that
he had appointed those names, but that
they had been left out of the journal by
the printer."
"That was after the Speaker was
elected?" su gested Enimons.
"Yes," Breiling responded, "but whether
he appointed these men after the election
of the Speaker or before, that I cannot
6ay."
The followine names, added to the roll
after the acpointment of the Speaker,
were read and noted by the committee:
T. W. Measure, electrician, $35; R. A.
White, gatekeeper, $28; W. A. Reyner,

XO ZOTE FOR THE LARKS.
Assembl'jtnan Price Declares They Are
an Enemy to Crops.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 26.â The
mellow warbling of the joyous meadow
lark, caroling in the shade of the redwoods
and among the vine and olive-clad slopes '
of Forestville, delights not the heart of
Assemblyman Price. When he awakens
in the morning and says his prayer, the j
sons of tbe lark drives pious thoughts out
of his mind. He h ars a million of them j
singing sweetly to their mates, while wax- j
; ing fat on his cherries and peaches in the
orchard, and the desire to murder is strong
, within his bosom.
So when Way mire of Alameda made a
pretty speech in the Assembly this morn
ing, telling his fellow-members from the
hills and dales and streams and groves
that the meadow-lark is the sweetest of
all the feathered songsters we know, that
its carol soothes the traveler passing by
and causes the plow horse to kick up his
heels at the plowboy, Mr. Price grew red
and pale by turns.
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker," and Mr.
. Speaker heard the call and recognized the
; gentleman from Sonoma as soon as Way
mire had taken his seat, with a coun
tenance exhibiting signs of a good deed
well done.
Then Price grabbed the bird idol of the
American poet, muffled its feathers and
stained its golden breast with gore as he
wrung its neck and cast it down quivering
at the feet of the poetic gentleman from
the city.
"The meadow lark is one of the most
. destructive birds we have. You should
go to Sonoma County and see how they
ruin the fruit and grain crops. They
should not be protected but should be
wiped off the face of the earth."
"I propose an amendment to the bill,
Mr. Speaker," said Dennery of San Fran
cisco.
The clerk read the amendment, which
was to insert in place of "meadow larks"
the words: "Chippies in cities and cities
and counties of the first-class." The dis
cussion was ended by the burst of laughter
which followed, and the meadow lark may
yet be saved.

Catting Off Priviieges That Are
Now EDJoyed by the
Southern Pacific.
Peculiarly Worded Measures That
Would Ha-nper the San Jcaquin
Valley Lino.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 26.â Friends
of the San Jaaquin Valley road say that
there is danger to all new railroad enter
prises in this State in certain bills now be
fore the Assembly. The first is Clark's
Assembly bill 433. already published in
The Call, to the effect that it snail be un
lawful lor the B>ard of Supervisors of any
county to grant any franchise for the con
struction, operation or extension of any
railroad over or upon any or part of any
county road or highway except for the
purpose of crossing the same. As every
traveler well knows a considerable portion
of the Southern Pacific lines run very close
to county roads at many points in the
State, and yet nobody has ever complained
of the contact. The utility of the public
of devoting a narrow strip of broad county
highway to railways is not a new dis-
| covery.
The San Joaquin Valley Railroad is laid
on a part of the county road running out
of Stockton, and no protest against its
operation has ever been raised by the m
j Habitants of the section of the country
penetrated by the railroad. The conces
sion is in tber interest and serves to
cheapen and facilitate the procuring of
rights of way. Obviously enough this is
why opposition to the Valley road is
striving at this time to bar the way. Tbe
Supervisors of San Joaquin, Stanislaus,
Tuoiumne and Calaveras counties are
ready and anxious to co-operate with all
legitimate projects to construct new rail
roads through the respective territories
over which they have jurisdiction.
Aware of this condition of Iffairs, and
that the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra
Pacific companies are seeking to secure
other rights of way in this fashion their
enemies hope to strangle thai bona fide
enterprise by inducing the Legislature to
enact a law prohibiting county Super
visors from granting any franchise "for
j the construction, extension or operation
of any railroad over or upon any or part
of any county road, or hiehway in any
county in the State of California, except
! for the purpose of crossing the same."
Mead's Assembly bi:l 331 amending
j section 359 of the Civil Code seems to be
another effort of the opposition. The
clause prohibiting companies from issuing
' bonds in a total amount greater than
90 per cant of the cost of the corporate
plan v, or property upon the security of
which the bonds are issued will if enacted
render it impossible to borrow the capital
necessary for the completion of any new
competing railroad in this State.
The legal construction to be given to the
wording of tbe proposed ordinance is that
no money can be borrowed until the work
of building a road has been finished and
the actual cost ascertained.
Assembly bill 310, by Dibble, is also ob
jected to by the friends of the Valley road.
It reads as follows:
Sec. 1255. Costs must In all cases be al
lowed to the defendant, and he shall be en
titled to include in his cost bill all payments
made by him to the official reporter for the
transcription of the notes of the evidence
given at the trial, whether such transcription
has been grdered by the court or not, and the
defendant shall also be entitled to recover as
costs a reasonable attorney's fee in the case,
to be fixed by the court.
The original section reads as follows:
"Costs may be allowed or not, and if al
lowed, may be apportioned between the
parties on tbe same or adverse sides, in
the discretion of tne court"
S. D. Woods of Stoctton, on behalf of
the Valley road, and Mr. Bullock, the
projector of the Sierra Pacific road, ar
rived here to-night to look after the bills.
GESERAL LEGISLATION.

Water- front Market.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan 26.-In the

full provisions are made for the establish
ment ana maintenance of a free public

ciscb. The text of the measure follows:
The State Board of Harbor Commissioners

all perishable products, arriving by rail, boat
or other conveyance, including fruit, vege
tables, eggs, poultry, game, dairy products
and fish, coming luto San Francisco, and shall
permit the Bale of such products thereon, by
or for account of producers only, under such
regulations as may be prescribed by the said
Harbor Commissioners, and as the public con
venience may require.
The docks and piers so set apart for a free
public market shall be as convenient as pos
sible to that portion of the Cfty and County of
San Francisco in which the principal whoe
sale trade in perishable products is now car
ried on, and must be so situated as to be ac
cessible to all water craft ordinarily employed
in carrying such products upon the waters of
San Francisco Bay, aud vessels so loaded shall
have preferenca in docking at said wharves
over others not so engaged.
Cocking room at said piers shall be assigned
without partiality to all vessels engaged In
the transportation of such products, and the
space assigned shall be sufficient to permit
such vessels regularly running upon a route
to receive and discharge their entire cargoes
at such piers if they so desire.
Appropriate space upon the State property
adjoining the piers shall be assigned for car
tracks, sufficient to accommodate the cars of
all lines bringing perishable products into the
City, with sheds ior discharging and unload
ing so far as the space will permit, and the
land belonging to the State, so far as it may
be required, shall be assigned for this purpose
in preference to other purposes.
For the use of these tracks the State Harbor
Commissioners shall prescribe such regula
tions as public convenience may require and
fix the compensation to be paid by the com
panies making use of them for th.s purpose.
The Harbor Commissionen must construct
suitable tramways and tracks or other devices
lor the rapid conveyance of perishable prod
ucts frwin car to boat or other conveyance to
the stalls id the free market and operate the
same.
Ths HaTbor Commissioners shall assign
space wiihin the free market to all producers
of perishable products and all commission
merchants or other agents of proa ucera, who
shall make application therefor and agree to
transact business within said free market
solely for producers' account and under such
regulations as the Harbor Commissioners may
prescribe, provided that commission m.er
chauts shall not occupy space to the exclusion
of producers who desire to sell in said free
market on their own account. Ko rental shall
be charged fur space in the free market. Any
violation of this act, or of the regulations
made pursuant thereof, shall exclude the per
son or firm guilty of sucn violation from the
privileges of selling in the free market during
the pleasure of the Harbor Commissioners,
not exceeding one year, in addition to any
other penalty which may be incurred thereby.
For the payment of the expenses for said free
market the Harbor Commissioners may, in
their judgment, so adjust the tolls as to pro
vide the necessary revenue.
The officers of said free market shall be a su
perintendent and assistant superintendent,
who shall also be secretary, and such othei
employes as the State Board of Harbor Com
missioners may appoint. The salary of all em
ployes of said free market shall be fixed by the
State Board of Harbor Commissioners.
All officers a-d employes of any public mar
ket on the State property are officers and em
ployes of the State, and Â£hall qualify in the
same manner as other employes, and give such
bonds as the Harbor Commissioners may pre
scribe.
A measure introduced with a view to
military operations in the State was pre
sented Joy Senator Dickinson to-day. It
will also, if passed, result in great benefit
to wheelmen and every one who has occa
sion to drive, ride or walk from one part
of the State to another. Its provisions
follow:
It Is hereby made the duty of the Boards of
Supervisors of the several counties of the State
of California, within ninety days after this act
takes effect, to have a topographical map of
their several counties made by the County
Surveyor, said map to be drawn to a scale of
oue-haf inch to the mile, to be divided into
townships and sections and te exhibit the lo
cation of all roads and highways, bridges,
streams, cities, towns, railroads, level and ele
vated lands and the general topographical
features of the county.
One copy of such map is to be filed with
the Board of Supervisors of each county
and one copy at the Capitol.
A measure to increase the salaries of
certain officers contacted with the San
Francisco Fire Department was submitted
by Senator BÂ°rt. It provides that the fol
lowing shall be tha salaries paid after the
passage of the bill: Chief engineer, $5000;
assistant chief engineer, $3600; secretary or
clerk, $3000; assistant engineers, $2100;
veterinary surgeons, $1800. The salaries
paid at present are: Chief engineer,
$3000; assistant chief engineer, $2400:
clerk, $1800; assistant engineers, $1800!
These salaries have not been changed
since 1878, where there were but twenty
one companies in San Francisco. There
are now fifty. The office of veterinary
surgeon is one to be newly created by the
bill.
Senator Pedlar presented a measure to
day which has threefold purpose in view.
It extends the rights of savings and loan
institutions in the matter of investing
their funds by permitting them to pur
chase and hola school-district bonds and
warehouse receipts for grain actually on
storage. He anticipates that this, by
bringing savings banks into competition
with commercial banks, will tend to se
cure better terms on loans obtained by
farmer?, and will also create a better
market lor the sale of school-district
bonds.
Treacy's Assembly bill 492 amends the
act governing the rock-crushing plant at
Folsom by providing that no crushed rock
shall be used in any of the streets of any
city or town, except in front of property
belonging to the State.
Fohlman has introduced No. 493 pro
viding for the relief of volunteer firemen
who may be disabled during active service.
It reads as follows:
Section 1. In any municipality having a
volunteer fire aepartment it shall be the duty
of the Board of Trustees or other governing
body, in its annual tax levy, to set apart an
amount equal to a per capita tax of $3 for
each active fireman on the roll of membership
of such department, who shall be thereon at
the time of the fixing of the annual tax levy,
and have so been for a period of not less than
one year immediately prior to such tax levy.
Sec. 2. A board of relief is hereby created
to consist of three trustees, to be annually
elected by said Fire Department.
Sec. 3. The duties of such hoard of relief
shall be to pass upon all claims for relief for
disabilities occurring during active service,
and shall have power to dra|r warrants pay
able from the said relief fund in amounts not
to exceed fifty dollars (S3O) at any one time.
S?c. 4. The chief engineer, in addition to
his usual duties, shall make an annual report
to the said trustees or other governing body at
such time as other annual reports of muni
cipal officers are made setting forth the con
dition of the department, number of fires at
tended, etc., etc. , and a complete list of the
active membership of said Fire Department,
from which list the per capita tax levy shall
be computed.
Sec. 5. Within the meaning of this act no
department shall consist of less than two \2)
companies.
Bee. 6. In addition to the chief engineer and
trustees, such fire department shall selectsuch
other officers as may be prescribed by the laws

to be known as the fireman's relief fund shall
be paid to the Treasurer of such town and by
him placed to the credit of such relief fund,
only to be disbursed upon an order or orders

Canavan's bill 494 provides that all imi
tations of butter or caeese shall be plainly
marked on the package with the words
"substitute for butter" or "substitute for
cheese," as the case may be, in printed
letters in plain rooian type of a size not
smaller than pica, an inch high and naif

of the manufacturer, the name of the
place where manufactured or put up, and

TO ORDER A. CHAAGE OF GRADE.
Favorable Action on the Bill Giving the
Sup*r*i*or* M re Power.
SACRAMENTO, . Cal., Jan. 26. â The
Assembly Committee on Municipal Cor
porations held a protracted meeting this
evening to consider Dibble's bill con
ferring power upon the Board of Super
visors to order a chansÂ» of grade of any
street in San j Francisco notwithstanding
the protest of any one owner of property
abutting on the grade.
Ex-Superintendent of Schools Denman,
Attorney Rosenthal and others addressed
the committee. It appeared from their
statements that under the law as it now
stands the protest of one property-owner
can prevent a change of grade. Denman
said that it was the wish of the majority
of property-holders in the business part
of the City to have the streets leading to
the City front as nearly level as possible
in order to facilitate the work of teams in
hauling merchandise, etc.
The residents and business people on
Polk street and Van Ness avenue wanted
a straig.it road -to the 'wharves; but they
were blocked by one or two property
owners. Rincon Hill should be cut
through, als<\ he paid, and all business
streets should be graded either level or
not more than a 5 per cent grade. Polk
street had several hogbacks which should
be cut down and hollows which should be
rilled up. San Francisco would grow very
fast in a few years, and would demand
level streets for tbe transaction of its
business.
After making a few amendments the
committee agreed to report favorably on
the bill.

Principles of Arbitration
Approved by Leaders
at the Capital.
Ex-Secretary Fester the First tc
Speak at a Big Public
Meeting.
Justice Brewer and Others Tell Why
It Is A ways Well to Avert
Horrors of Warfare.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 26.-A very
distinguished audience, representative of
social and business elements of the Na
tional capital, filled the Grand Opera
house at 4 o'clock this afternoon ''to
attest their approbation of the ereat prin
ciple of international arbitration as em
bodied in the treaty between this country
and Great Britain, pending In the Senate."
Ex-Secretary John W. Foster, who
called the meeting to order, disclaimed
any purpose of criticizing or seeking un
duly to hasten or influence the action of
the Senate. He said be recognized the
Senate as a co-ordinate branch of the Gov
ernment. He closed by saying:
"I venture, however, to say, speaking
for myself, that the final action of the
Senate will not be such as to defeat the
treaty, which is desired by the great ma
jority of the people of the United States
and whose defeat would discredit this-
Government in the eyes of the civilized
world."
The outcome of the^meeting wa3 the
unHnimous adoption of a resolution de
claring that, "believing this treaty to be
a distinct advance toward the best civili
zation and trusting that it may prove a
helpful example for other nations, we
shall hail with joy and patriotic pride its
adoption by the United States."
Rev. Â£. B. Hubbard was the presiding
officer and delivered an eloquent address,
after which he declared be looked forward
to the day when there will be a court
which shall be'recognized by all nations,
which shall look into all difficulties and
settle ihem by arbitration.
President E. L. Whitman of Columbia
University made some pointed remarks
about two diseases prevailing in American
social life, one known as anglomania and
another disease largely political in its
character, known as anplophobia. He
claimed that anglophobia was as unrea
sonable as anglomunia was ridiculous.
Ex-Senator John B. Henderson, form
erly of Missouri now of Washington,
delivered a vigorous address in support of
the general principle of arbitration, in
which he incidentally critic zed the tone
of President Cleveland's Venezuelan mes
sage, and asked if arbitration was good for
England and Venezuela why not good for
England and the United States.
Asbociate Justice Brewer of the United
States Supreme Court, who was intro
duced as president of the Venezuelan
commission, aroused the audience to the
height of enthusiasm. He began by say
ing that when he received tue request of
the committee to take tart, in the proceed
ing? and was sure that the speeches would
be limited to five minutes, be came to the"
conclusion that all he would have to do
would be to stand up and be counted in
favor of arbitration because in bis experi
ence no lawyer couid say what he had to
say under two hours. So he had come
here to be counted in favor of arbitration.
â¢'When I say that," continued Justice
Brewer, "I do r.ot want to be considered
as one who would trespass upon the pre
roeative of the Senate to make a care.ul
canvass of every line of that treaty. I
appreciate fully the words of the Senator
trom Massachusetts (Hoar) recently ut
tered in protest auainst pressure for haste.
I do not believe in saying 10 the gentlemen
chareed with the duty of considering care
fully that treaty that 'you must vote for
it.' There is something in my own nature
which, when anybody says to me 'You
must,' causes something to run up my

Here's a proposition you never heard of beforeâ a twentieth-century
idea in a Clothing Sale.
This week we have put on sale the samples of Men's, Boys' and Chil-
dren's Clothing that our Traveling. Salesmen have returned. Formerly, at
the end of the season, we sold these samples to retail dealers who bought
goods of us, at a fraction of their valueâ just because they were samples.
Now we give you that advantageâ give you the opportunity to buy the best
Clothing at a saving you little dreamed of.
The number Is not large ; to get your choice come at once. It's worth

â¢â¢It is the Senate's duty to consider that
treaty carefully, and when 1 say that it is
no trespass upon their richt3 for Ameri
can citizens to express their views of
that treaty, I am sure there is no one
who will more cheerfully accord that right
than the senior Senator from Slassa
cim -setts (Mr. Hoar), whom we all delight
to honor. In spile cf all the in imations
I see iv the press I believe that the Senate
will not declare itself 'in favor of the taw,
but against its enforcement.' They will
act upon it with the desire to do the best
for the interests not al >ne of this country,
but for thf world. [Applause.] I know
Judges raaice mistakes, having been on
the bench many years.
"I know it is dangerous to submit grave
questions to such a tribunal, and if I
could cite my brother w:th whom I have
been associated for two years (referring to
Justice Harl an, one of the Bering Sea
arbitrators) 1 think I could illustrate that
at his expense. [Laughter.] But, then,
what are the errors and losses incidental
to arbitration compared to the horrors of
war? [Applause.] What are a few mil
lion dollars of wrongful damages in com
parison to the sacrifice ol thousands of
numan lives?"
Justice Brewer in hispe'oration brought
down the house by a brief bu: dramatic
poem on "Lost Opportunities," which, to
the surprise of many of his bearers, he
said had been written by bis fellow-citi
zen, ex -Senator John J. Ingallsof Kansas.
He declared in ring'ne tones his opinion
that the United States now had an opdot

for the purpose of publicly attesting upproba
tion of the great principle of arbitration em
bodied in the treaty between the United States

sympathy with the object of this meeting and
ardently hope that the promise held out to us
by this treaty of settling our disputes with
out thosA tareats and rumors of war so
disturbing to public peace and business will
be iulfilled, I regret that a previous engage
ment which I cannot postpone will prevent
me from joining in person the distinguished
gentlemen who hava issued the call in ap
proving the arbitration. In taking this course
a joint letter has been published expressing
the sentiments of Cardinals Vaughn, Logue

SLhIGUISH CATASTROPHE.
Forty lounff Person* Oo Over a Preci- |
pice Into a Qunrrtt. ,
ALTOONA, Pa.. Jan. 26.â At 10 o'clock
last night a sleighing party of forty per
sons from Tyrone accidentally drove into
the ' quarry at Pemberton. The sled,
horses and pleasure-seekers were precipi
tated to the Dottom of the precipice,
wÃere they lay in a great mass. A special
train from Tyrone conveyed to the scene
of the catastrophe all the doctors in town,
The party was mostly made up of young
people. Boys and girls with arms and
legs broken, with blood streaming from
their woun 'a, lay in great drifts of snow,
slowly perishing from the intense cold.
The mercury was 3 deg. below zero,
adding to the horror of the catastrophe.
The latest reports say that none are dead,
though twenty are fearfully injured,
among them Alice Haddtn, Jessie Stone.
Eugene Crampton, William Jones and
Howard Templeton.
Just who is to blame for the accident no
one likes to say. The horror of the situa
tion is so great that people talk very little
about it. Some of the people in the party
had many relatives and friends and the
grief of the community is consequently j
great. .i'^A''".. ._ : ; . ':.â '. â¢ :^J:

IN CUBA'S CAUSE
Quotes Monroe's Messages
in Support of His
Contention.
Foints Out That Recognition of
Belligerency Is Not a
Cause of War.
Other Senators Discuss the Bill
Concerning an International
Monetary Conference.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 2H.â ln the
Senate to-day, Frye (R.) of Maine pre
sented the remonstrance of a labor union
against the restoration of flozging in the
merchant marine. In the lalter connec
tion, Frye slated that there was no amend
ment pending in the Senate or any b;ll
that restored flogging in the merchant
marine. On the contrary, the amendment
referred to, in the unanimous opinion of
the Senate Committee on Commerce, save
greater security than the existinn law or
any other bill now pending in Congress to
she sailor against brutality by master or
officer at sea.
Hill (D.) of New York, from the Judi
ciary Committee, presented a report on
the general subject of concurrent resolu
tions, and suggested tnat it he ou the
table for the present.
Tne House amendments to the Senate
bill for the survey of a water route from
the mouth of the jetties, at Galveston,
Tex., to Houston, Tex., were laid Lefore
the Senate and concurred in.
Turpie (D. ) of Indiana then resumed his
speech, begun yesterday, on the subject of
recognition of the republic of Cuba. He
said that he would a great deal rather de
pend upon the credit of the Cuban Re
public than upon the resources of Spain,
stripped as she was of one great source of
revenueâ the isiand of Cuba. He quoted
from a message of President Monroe in
1817, on the subject of war between Spain
and her revolted South American colo
nies, to show that belligerency was then,
in the second year of the war, recognized
by the United States.
He also quoted from President Monroe's
messages of 1819 and 1820,0n the same sub
ject, in which the hope it expressed that
Spain will terminate the exhausting con
troversy on the basis of independence â
not on the basis of autonomy, as now sug
gested by the administration for Cuba.
If the recognition of Cuban belligerency
â would be a cause of war with Spain,
then the United States should have de
clared war against Spain from the day
after the surrender of Lee at Appomattox.
No war ensued from tb.3 recognition of
belligerency. Dor even irom the recogni
tion of independence. President Monroe
had recognized the independence of seven
bomb. American republic in success on
without war ensuing. Amity and peace
prevailed between Spain and America that
was uniirokan. There was no fear ot war
with Spain. There had never been such
a war, and he hoped and trusted that
there never would be. The rscognition of
belligerency was a right, not a cause of
war.
Turpie also quoted from the message of
lf~2i, which he called "the great message"
â that declaring the Monroe doctrine â and
compared with it the position of the pres
ent executive, v. - hich showed, he said,
rather an anxiety that the revolution
Bhould fail and that the Spanish Govern
ment should be restored. He went on to
compare the strength of the Spanish and
the revolutionary armies. Tlie Cubans,
tie said, had 35,000 men, trained, disci
plined and armea with the very best ma
terial and with all the munitions of war,
and had a 15 035,000 other men, trained and
disciplined, but armed with inferior
weapons.
he said, had 100,000 regular troops
â40,000 in stations along troctia?, 40,000 in
garrisons in the seaports and 20,0* X) in hos
pitals, suffering from wonnus and disease.
{Spain had also 50,000 militia, in order to
allow the regulars more leisure, more free
dom in conducting tne principal cam
paien.
What principal campaign, he asked,
bad they conducted ; what effective cam
paigh? Cuban independence, he declared,
â¢was already an accomplished fact, but
that did not neces.<ariiy imply that the
hpanisu forces would cease fighting.
In conclusion, Mr. Turpie said: "If the
Cuban patriots succeed we may then
cJaim thAt we were friends of the republic
â friends in need, irienrts in the hour and
day of danger. If failure befall them
(which may God avert) our action will
Btiil lose nothing of grace or grandeur and
we Bball then keep faith with the quench
less spirit of freedom which ha- set our
feet in such a large room.' '
At the conclusion of Turpie's speech.
Hill's joint resolution as to tne recognition
ol foreign governments was taken from
the table and placed on the calendar.
Chandler move 1 to proceed to the con
sideration of the bill for the purpose of
representation of the United States at any
international monetary conference here
after to be called.
White sent to the clerk's desK and had
read an editorial from Chandler's paper
declaring that Senator Sherman is to be
the leader of the Republican party in the
new administration, and giving numerous
citations from Sherman's speeches in favor
of silver money.
After the reading. White said he pre
sumed tne quotations were correct, as
f-berinan was'in his seat and did not cor
net them.
Can:io:i (R.) of Utah said that the mere
presentation of the pending bill was a rec
ognition of the Republican party that a
rest nation of silver to its old place as a
mo'.iey metal was required by the world,
anu especially by the United States.
knowing the ardent devotion to the cause
oi bimetallism of the Senators from New
Hampshire and Colorado (Chandler and
Wolcott) he was not disDosed to admit
that the bill was proposed in a mere per
functory spirit, and he should vote for it
in la present form if no better phraseol
ogy could be substituted.
Stewart (Pop.) ol Nevada pave notice of
an amendment providing that in case the ]
international conference should be held
and should not agree on a system of inter
national bimetallism, it snail be the duty
of the Secretary of the Treasury, one
montn after the adjournment of the con
ference, to coin ail the gold and silver
brought to the mints for the benefit of de
positors, the silver into standard dollars
and the gold into coin as now provided by
law.
The bill went over after notice by Chand
ler that he would press it to a vote as soon
as possible.
- The Nxaragua canal bill was then taken
up, and Morgan (D.) of Alabama, in charge
oi it, offered an amendment designed to
meet the objections suggested in the letter
from the Minister of the Greater Republic
of Central America. It is to tiip effect that
at least 5 per cent of the $100,000,000 capi
tal shall be reserved for the Central
American governments, and that notuing
In the bill snail bo construed as empower
ing the canal company to do anything m
zonsistem with the terms of its conces
lion.
At the close of Morgan's speech Daniel
(D.) of Virginia began a sarcastic speech
on the monetary question bristling with
allusions to the.Uspatch of Senator AY ol
cott of Colorado as the "erubassador pleni
potentiary of the Republican party for
the restoration of tnat (Treat Atnencan
system of bimetallic finance which they
had beon so successful in destrovine.
Passin- from this divereence Daniel ad
dressed himÂ«dÂ« to the hill immediately
before the Senate-thc Nicaragua canal
billâ which he strongly opposed.
\t the close of Daniel's speech the Sen
ate at 5:25 went into executive session and
shortly thereafter adjourned until to-mor
row.
BVVSE OtKHISIIttS A VETO.
A Totally Blind Jou>* Veteran Has Ilia
iV union Hvitovd.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 26.-An
other Presidential veto was repudiated by
the House to-day. The bill to restore
Jonathan Scott, a veteran of the Fifth
lowa Cavalry, to the pension roll (from
which he was dropped by the bureau in
1894) at the rate of $72 a month for a total
blindness, failed to rece.ve Mr. Cleveland Â«
approval. Upon recommendation of the
Committee on Inva iri Pen-ions the House,
by a vote of 137 to 52, passed the bill over
the veto.
A bill was passed to pay $462 to John
McÃae, a deputy United States Marshal,
lor expenses incurred by him in 1859 in
seizing and caring tor thirty-six members
of the cargo of Air. cans landed by the
ship Wanderer near Savannah, in an
effort to evade the anti-slave trade law,
the thirty-six being afterward returned
to Africa. ,
Hitt (K.) of Illinois reported the diplo
matic and consular appropriation bill,
which was placed on the calendar.
The rest of the day was spent in com
mittee of the whole in consideration of
the Indian appropriation bill. There re
mained thirty of the eighty-one pages un
disposed of when the committee rose, and
the House adjourned at 5:10 o'clock.
WRECKED ON A SIDING.
The Eastbound Uuion Pac.fic
Fiyer Is Badly Dam
a?ed.
Two Pul mans Smashed to Splinters.
It Is No: Known if Any L yes
Were Lost.
CHEYENNE, Wto., Jan. 27.â The end
of the eastbound Union Pacitic flier was
wrecked at Tie Siding, a small station
about thirty miles west of Cheyenne,
about 1 o'clock this morning.
The east-bound train arrived at the j
siding first and ran onto it in order to j
allow the west-bound, then due, to pa:^
Owing to the crowded condition of the
siding the waiting train could not get
clear of the main track, and two Pullmans
were left beyond tne switch.
Before the siding could be cleared the
westbound train dashed into the rear Pull
mans and smashed them almost to splin
ters.
Immediately the uninjured eneine was
brought out from the siding and s -nt into
Cheyenne with the news, and a wrecking
â  train was sent to the scene of the disaster.
The two Pullmans, which bore the brunt
of the shock, were well filled with sleep
-1 ing passengers. It is known that among
the passengers were several Californians.
There is no telegraph station at Tie
Siding, and so details of the wreck are
but meager. It is reported that some
hours must elapse before definite news
reaches this coast.
The westbound train was going at near
ly full speed at the time of the collision, |
and it is reported that it must have been
a bad one.
A CONSULAR IMBROGLIO.
Commercial Complications Caused by the
Greater Republic of Central
America.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 26.â N. Bolet-
Peraza, the newly appointed Consul-Gen
eral of the Greater Republic of Central
America, a number of the steamship own
ers whose vessels run to ports in Hon
duras, Salvador and Nicaragua, and a lot
of merchants doing business with the
same ports are all much worked up over
the refusal of Jacob Biaz to give way to
the new Consul-General and recognize him
as the rightful consular representative of
the combined Central American republics.
As a result of the controversy between
Bolet-Peraza and Uiaz there is also a ques
tion of validity of a lot of invoices which
Biaz has passed as Consul-General of Hon
duras since the official appointment of
Bolet-Peraza.
The new Consul-General said last night
that the cargoes would be liable to seizure
as smuggled goods in the absence of in
voices signed by nim and that it will be
his duty to see that this liability is exe
cuted. A year ago last June Honduras,
Salvador and Nicaragua entered . into a
treaty for the promotion of the greater
republic of Central America. According
to the terms of treaty the three countries
were to aboli-n their separate foreign lega
tions and leave foreign affairs to a diet of
three membersâ one for each of tne coun
tries, which should appoint representa
tives abroad. This diet organized in Sep
tember last. It recalled all existing pat
ents to consuls and in November ap
pointed Bolet-Peraza, who was consul
officer of Salvador, Consul-General here,
and Jose G. Rodriquez Minister to this
country.
On January 16 Adolph D. Btrauss, who
had been Consul for New York, turned
j over his records, etc., to Bolet-Peraza, but
Biaz would not. He said he had been ap
' pointed by the Government of Honduras
and had received no notice of removal
from that country. Some merchants got
their invoices signed by Bolet-Peraza and
some by Biaz.
A representative of Biaz said last nignt
that the trouble was over. "Mr. Biaz,' he
said, "refused to trive up his place until he
was officially notified that he was relieved,
but he has now received notice and will
retire."

California.
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 26.â "We
will have nine stars in our banuer instead
of four before the end of the century,"
declared Susan B. Anthony, the veteran
president of the National American
Woman Suffrage Society, in her annual
address to the convention wnich opened
to-day. She seized the banner from the
desk before her and waved it aloft. "It is
an American rla?, save that it Has only
f jur stars â one for every State which has
granted full suffrage to woman," and
the confident declaration of the beloved
president set the convention in an uproar
of applause that last <l several minutes.
The convention opened this arternoon
in the Central Christian Church, with
about 300 ladies present. It was 15 de
grees below zero, but the cnurch was
crowded to iÂ»s capacity forenoon and
afternoon. Seventeen States were repre
sented, the weather keeping away many
delegations.
Miss Anthony presided, assisted by
Anna Howard S ;aw of Philadelpnia, vice
president at large. It was voted that no
State that das not paid its dues should be
allowed to vote.
The following committee on resolutions
was named:
Colorado, Mary C. C. Bradford ; Illinois, Mrs.
Kate Hushes; lowa, Mrs. Julio Clarke Hallsm;
Kansas, Mrs. E. M. Wardell; Kentucky, Sarah
C. Bennett; Mtissachusett^ Mrs. H. C. Black
well: Massachusetts National, Mr*. C M. A:

nesota, Miss Martha Scott Anderson ; Missouri.
Ella HttrriÃon; Montana, Dr. Mary A. Atwater;
Nebraska, Mrs. AbbieGay Dustin; New Jersey,
Mrs. P. C. Wright; New York, Mrs. H. Banck;
j Ohio, Dr. Violet Swift; Pennsylvania, Miss
I Marie Beatrice Loucks.
Miss Shaw made her report as vice-pres
ident at large brief, because the same
ground was covered by the address of the
president. She told of the campaign
waged the la-t year in California for th<Â»
woman suffrage amendment, resulting in
110,000 votes for and 123,000 against. It
was the largest vote suffrage had ever re
ceived in any State, although it did not
carry.
Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery, the secretary,
told of the work of the National headquar
ters in Fiiiladelpnia in sendine out liter
ature ann securing assistance irom the
Dress.
She said the past year bad been t c
most successful in this direction in the
History of the association. She recom
mended that the headquarters be removed
to New York. She said the States that
had secured suffrage because of the assist
ance of the National organization most
always drifted from it and were of little
assistance afterward. She recommended
that the association be divided into two
houses, making the women from the en-
I franchisee! States the upper house.
Miss Anthony delivered her address,
which was enthusiastically received, in
the afternoon. Among other things she
said :
The year 1896 witnessed greater successes
than any other eince the first pronunciamen to
was marie at Senecu Falls, N. V., July i 9, 1888.
On January b the President proclaimed Utah
to be a State, with a constitution that does not
discriminate agafnat women. Thus we have
two States coming into the Union on the prin
ciple of equal rights to ali women guaranteed
oy their constitutions.
November 3, by a majority of 6000 the men
of Idaho declared in favor of woman suffrage,
and for the first time In the history of judi
cial decisions upon the enlargement of
woman's rightÃ, civil and phjuficat, the courts
of Idaho â Judges Houslan, Morgan and Sulli
van â unanimously decided that the amend
| ment so carried was constitutional. This ue
cisiou is the more ratnarkable, because the
constitution might easily as well have been
interred to require amendments to receive a
majority of the total votes cast at the election
as a mabority of the votes cast on the amend
ment.
By the former construction the amendment
would have been lost, notwithstanding that of
all who cared to express an opinion two to
one were in lavor. Jl any one will go through
the history ol our woman suffrage movement
since the days of reconstruction and the
adoption of the fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments to the Federal constitution
taking the decisions of the Supreme Court of
the United States in the cases of Myra Brad
weli for the protection of her civil rights, and
of Mrs. Virginia L. Munro for the protection
of her political rights, and the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States Riving
women the right to vote for County School
Commissioners, and various other decisions â
he will find that in every ca-e the court has
put the narrowest possible construction upon
the spirit and letter of the constitution.
Whereas, the Judges did themselves the
honor to make a decision in direct opposition
to judicial precedent and prejudice, so the
Idaho victory is a great cred it, not only to the
niÃJority of men who stood for the amend
ment, but to the three Judges who made this
broad and just decision. The National Asso
ciation speakers went to Idaho â Mrs. Oevoe in
1895, Mrs. Johns and Mrs. Gatt in 1896â and
thty, with Mrs. Bradford and Miss Reynolds
of Colorado, iieid meetings and organized
suffrage clubs in the' different settlements
throughout the State. I have not yet leurneci
how many of the resident women took i art in
the campaign.
We also had pending in California woman
suffrage amendments. Your president, vice
preside!! t-at-iarge and National organizer, to
gether witti Miss Yates, Mms Hay, Miss Mills,
Miss Swett and Miss Lucy Antnony, gave
more or less time to speaking and working in
that State for eight motitns. Never have I
seen more thorough and effective educational
work done in any one of the thirteen suff raije
amendment campaigns since 1887. Could we
have counted out the two largest cities â San
Francisco and Oakland â the amendment would
have been carried by about 500 majority; and
in this connection i want to call your atten
tion to the immensity ot that State, stretching
nearly a thousand miles north and south, and
with au area greater than all New England,
New York and Pennsylvania combined.
The facilities are very poor, and. long and
weary stagings are necessary to reach the men
who Â»re scattered over the ranches and mines
oi that great territory.
Sau Kr&nclsco is to California what New
York City is to the Empire State. All the
rural counties can be educated so that a ma
jority can be given for any measure of justice,
out the cities of San Francisco and Oakland
contain a very large number of loreign born
voters and native born Chinese who have just
come of age, aud this weighted down the in
telligence not only of thoÂ»o two cities but of
the rent of the State.
But California's defeat Is simply victory de
ferred, for the Legislature is sure to resubmit
the amendment, and the educational cam
paign carried on for the last two years will be
continued for the coming two, when a large
enough number will be converted to overcome
the slum vote, and November, 1898, will add
to our flag the star of Calilornia.
But it is not only in California that we are
likely to have amendment campaigns during
the coming two years, but Nevada and Oregon
and quite probably Washington and Montana.
I thing the one and only sure thing to carry
an amendment is througu the organization of
a club in every voting precinct of every
county of the State.
It is little use for us to make our appeals
upon State or National political party conven
tions, or on Congress or State Legislatures for
resolutions in favor of woman's enfranchise
ment, while no appeals come up to thorn irom
tut' rank and tile of the voters.
Our wvirit, thereiure, for the coming year, is
to puth local organization more thoroughly
than ever before, and to do that work preciLCt
by precinct, even if we compass but one county
of a State during the year.
Following this reports were made by j
Mary Hay for California, who said that
suffrage would carry there the next time,
and it would be soon, and by Mary C. C.
Bradford for Colorado, who said the work
in that State, where women now have the
franchise, is to make it a success. Ea uca
tion must be done among the women, aud
they must be trained to interest them
selves in the use of the ballot. Mrs.
Catherine McCuliough Waugh spoke for
Illinois.
Senator J. E. Rowen. the suffraee leader
in tbe lowa Legislature, made an address,
which was received wuh much enthusi
asm. He declared that he believed that
another trial would bring victory in lowa,
although be could offer no encouragement
with the present Legislature.
Mrs. Adelaide Ballard, for lowa, said
much encouragemeut was received from
the Legislature, and she believed lowa
was near to adding a star to the flag.
MisÂ« Laura Ciay for Kentucky and Mrs.
Wiilard for Michigan made short reports,
encouraging in Â»one.
Alice Stone Blnckweil of Boston con
cluded tue day's programme with a strong
address on equal rights.
In tlio evening a reception was given to
the members of the association and the
members of the lowi Legislature at the
home of Mrs. A. F. Hubbell. Theie was
a great crush, fully 1000 people attending.
The association will probably be invited
to attend the Legislatnra on Thursday
and the members will be given an oppor
tunity to spenk.
FRIGHTFUL RAILWAY WRECK.
Canadian Pacfic Express Plunges Down
an Embankmentâ Two Persons Killed
and Many Injured.
MONCTON, N. 8., Jan. 26.â Palmers
Pond was tc-day the scene of a most dis
astrous railway wreck.
The Canadian Pacific express, running
over tbe Inter-Colonial Railroad tracks,
due at Moiicton at 1 P. M., arrived at Dor
chester a little behind time, and when
turning the bend at Palmers Pond the
train broke away from the engine, pre
sumably owing to a broken rail, and
dashed over a 75-foot embankment to the
ice in the pond below.
The engine on breaking away from the
cars kept its course and was brought
through to Dorchester station, where the
news was first made known, and a wreck
ing train was hurriedly sent to the scene
of the accident.
Meanwhile those who had survived the
fearful plunge bent ihemselves to the task
of rescuing the more unfortunate. The
intense cohi added to the iiorrors of the
situation and the sufferings of the injured.
When the wrecking train arrived at the
wreck the United Associated Presses'
representative, who was on board, lound
two of the occupants dead and nearly a
score more or less injured. They had
been tak n from the wrecked coaches ana
laid upon the snow on the bank of the
pond.
One of the dead was a woman, Miss
Patriquin, a dressmaker of Bloomfield,
Kings County, N. 8., who was taken from
tne coach in which she went down to her
death in an almost unrecognizable condi
tion. The other was Postal Clerk Edge
comb of St. John, N. B.
Tne injured were rescued from the up
turned coaches through the windows.
The most â¢ seriously injured are: Hon.
Dr. Borden, Minister of Militia, cut
about the head; Henry McLeod of
Pictou; Mr. Brner of Amherst, N. 8. ;
Rupert Neil of Westvilte, S. C. ;
Edward Blanr.hard of Amherst, A. W.
Taylor of Amberst, A. W. West of Am
herst, George P. Buring of Halifax,
Charles Thompson, brakeman. All of the
latter were more or less injured.
The dead and injured were placed
aboard the wrecking train and brought to
this oty. The wrecked coaches were
seven in number, aud all were smashed
Â£lmost to splinters on tbe ice in the
pond. The laiW were torn up and the
track badly damaged.
STILL BELOW ZERO.
Many Frostbitten and Hungry Sufferers at
Chicago, but Relief Work Is
Going Ahead.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 26.â Bitterly cold
weather, aggravated by wind, continued
to afflict the poor people of Chicago to-day
and make the lot of those more fortunate
at least uncomfortable and attended with
danger from frost bites.
At midnight to-night the official record
was that of three successive days of tem
perature below zero, and in the double
figures most of that time, too. The most
cheering information that can be given
by the Weather Bureau as to the future is
that the tenaency to moderation mani
fested after noon to-day will probably
continue to-morrow. It will not be so
co!d â about zero â and the cold wave may
slightly decrease during the day.
The day began with the mercury show
ing 14 degrees beiow zero, falling to 16 Dy
6 o'clock thi3 morning. When the army
of store-workers and other wage-earners
were compelled to leave their homes they
suffered under a temperature of 15 degrees
below. At noon the weather had mod
erated to 9 degrees, and from that time
until 4 o'clock the mercury continued ris
ing. It was stationary a 4 degree* for sev
eral hours after that hour, but fell slowly
late to-night, as usual.
An un Known man was found frozen to
death on the outskirts of the village of
Tinley Park, near Blue Island, on the
Rock Island, this morning. James Mc-
Cormick and George Wentz, a teleirraph
operator, were found at an early hour to
gether on Wells street, with both their
bands frozen. Many less severe cases of
freezing were reported during the day
from the police stations and drug stores.
The suffering from want of food and
sufficient clothing has been arrested by a
generot's contribution of money, food and
clothing. Tne relief fund reached nearly
$10,000 this evening, subscriptions coming
trom outsiue the city, and many thou
sands ot dollars worth of supplies were
received fiom citizens. Tbe whole police
force under the practical uirect ion of Chief
Badenoch was utilized day and night to
ascertain the needs of tne sufferers and
distribute supplies in patrol wagons and
ambulances.
It is estimated that 15.000 persons have
been given enough food, fuel and clothing
to keep them irom extreme suffering since
the Mayor's proclamation was issued.
Mayor Switt said that more distress had
been found among the poor and absolutely
destitute than had been expected, and the
demands made for help were becoming so
great that it might become necessary for
him to appoint special committees to col
lect additional funds among the business j
men ot the city. .
Every police station has been made a
storehouse for coal, beef, beans, peas,
coffee, flour and meal. The starving peo
ple were brought to the stations and given
a liberal allowance, with an invitation to
call again when the supnly was exhausted.
The mo3t numerous cases of acute suffer
ing come from South Chicago and Grand
Crossing-.
The officials and employes of the Postal
Telegraph Cable Company made up a
fund of $2000. v
Frozen to Death in Sovth Dakota.
YANKTON, S. D., Jan. 26â On Friday
last John Winter, a farmer, living four
teen mile 3 northwest of this city, was
frozen to death within a mile of his home,
fhe body being found yesterday by a
neighbor, who spent the greater part of
thf day in a search for him.
Winter ieft this city Friday afternoon
before dark. His mother, who came to
town with him, was persuaded by friends
to remain over Sunday on account of the
intense cold, but no persuasion could pre
vail upon him.

SANTA BARBARA'S
DAY OF MOURNING
Dr. Richard J. Hall's Body
Borne to Its Final
Rest.
Old and Young Alike Weep at
the Bier of the Poor
Man's Friend.
Successes Achieved by the Physician
Who Was Beloved by All
Who Knew Him-
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 2txâ
This has been Santa Barbara's day of
mourning. To-day the May of one who j
claimed as liis friend the totterinc octo
genarian and the laughing child alike
was borne to its last, resting place in
Montecito Cemetery. The man so hon
ored in death, for whom the tt-ars of an
entire city were shed, was Dr. Richard J.
Hall. The announcement of his death at j
10 o'clock Sunday morning, though not
wholly unexpected, fell upon the people
of this city like a thunderbolt from a clear j
sky. It is doubtful if there is another in- !
stance where a stranger coming among
strangers won in seven short years the
love and admiration accorded to Dr. Hall.
Yesterday the Mayor issued a procla
mation requesting that all city offices be
closed and asking the citizens to close
business houses between the hours of 1
nnd 4 this afternoon. This was strictly
and voluntarily adhered to. The funeral
procession, preceded by a band, started
from l>r. Hall's iate residence, buck of the
Mis.-ion, at 2 o clock. it halted at the
Presbyterian Church, where the funeral
sermon and a final benediction were im
pressively delivered by the Rev. Dr. Car
rier.
The church was a marvel of floral decor
ations, so unstintingly and tastefully had
the ladies of the St. Cecilia Club arranged
their offerings of garlands. Pink and
white were the prevailing colors. As the
pall-bearers entered the edifice the orches
tra played "Prayer," by Salome. The
procession moved slowly to the pulpit,
the coffin being followed by the honorary
pall-bearers. As the casket was placed
before the altar it was covered by a pal:
of 60,000 violets. Surrounding the coffin
were several hundred very beautiful floral
pieces, contributed by the associations
wit n which the doctor was connected.
The Philharmonic Society contributed a
large harp of carnations and maidenhair
ferns. From Brooklyn and New York
had come telegraphic orders for many
Moral offerings.
Mrs. Hall and her two daughters en
tered the church together. The pall
bearers, hospital nurses in costumes and
members of the household occupied seats
near i tie bereaved family.
Every vehicle that could be procured in
this and neishboring towns whs tilled by
those who knew the man in life and who,
as a last offering to his memory, followed
his body to its last resting-place. At
Montecito Cemetery the services were
brief and simple.
Born in the historic town of Armagh,
Ireland, Dr. Hall came withhis ptren ts
to New York, his father, the Rev. Dr.
John Hall, accepting a call to the Fifth
avenue Presbyterian Church, which he
still holds. The future doctor received his
early tuition at the public schools of New
York, entering Princeton Coll -go in 1871
and graduating in the class of 1875. He
took while at college an active interest in
athletics and was a member of the Prince
ton crew which rowed at Saratoga in the
year of his graduation.
He then entered the College of Physi
cians and Surgeons of New York City, and
was graduated in 1878, securing the first
position in a special examination of honor
men. He was immediately appointed
interne in Roosevelt Hospital, where he
completed the fall term of service, a year
and a half.
In October, 1879, shortly after the com
pletion of his ho-pital service, Dr. Hall
married Mis* Eliza Coolidge of Boston,
and went abroad to continue his medical
studies.
After a prolonged stay in Europe,
principally in Vienna and Heidelberg, he
returned to New York, where he became
a-^ociated with the late Dr. Henry B.
Sands, the distinguished surgeon. Dur
ing the early part of this connection ho
conducted classes in medical instruction
which were unusually successful. Subse
quently he was appointed demonstrator
of anatomy in the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, and later still was ap
pointed to the assistant professorship of
anatomy in the institution,, after severe
competition, in which two surgeons of
National reputation took part.
During this period he was largely in
strumental in organizing and putting into
operation the well-known outdoor service
ol Roosevelt Dispensary. This was an in
novation to dispensary work, since it in
volved daily attendance on the part of the
surgeons, and developed into one of the
greatest clinics in the country.
Dr. Hall was at this time appointed vis
iting surgeon at St. Luke's, Bellevue and
Roosevelt hospitals, a distinction rarely
attained by any surgeon, and perhaps
never before by one so young.
While as-ociated with Dr. Sands he
performed, it is stated on good authontv,
the first operation in this country for
appendicitis, and he operated three times
for the same disease before it received its
name at the hands of his distinguished
associate.
Under the arduous strain of his ex
tended service Dr. Hall's health broke
down in spite of the relief afforded by
several vacations, and he came to Santa
Barbara in the fall of 1889.
From here he went to the Sandwich Isl
ands, but returned in a short time and
made Santa Barbara his home. He was
appointed chief surgeon of the Cottage
Hospital some five- years ago, and had
since performed many remarkable opera
tions.
Dr. Hall was a contributor to scientific
literature, and only a short, time ago sent
a paper by special request to the Paris
Academy of Medicine.
His skill was at ail times at the service
of the poor, and be performed operation
after operation without reward save the
gratitude of the patient. Aside from his
profession, Dr. Hail took a:i active interest
in all that pertained to Sun.?. Barbara.
He was elected president of the Flower
Festival Association in 1894 and retained
the office until his death. Dr. Hall was of
magnificent appearance â tail, finely pro
portioned and stately.

CREEDS TAUGHT
IN THE SCHOOLS
Bishop Montgomery Says
the Law Is Openly
Violated.
Protests Against Sectarian Re
ligious Services Before
Pupils.
The Preaching of a Baccalaureate
Sermon Calls Forth a Spirited
Communication.
LOSAAGBLES, Cat.., Jan. 26.â Bishop
George Montgomery of the Catholic dio
cese of Monterey and LO3 Angeles pub
lished an open letter in tne Herald of this
city to-day which will be read with inter
est all over CaJifornia, since it raises a
question of vital import to every citizen
of the State. The communication in full
is as follows:
As a citizen and taxpayer of this city-I beg
enough space in your paper to enter a re^peci
iul protest against permitting our non-secta
rian schools to be made feeders to sectarian
denominations, in plain violation of the con
stitution of the State.
H seems to me that this sort of thins has
gone on about long enough. Time and time
ajtain our daily papers have informed us that
at the closing exercises oi our schools the
minister of some religious denomination ad
dressed the classes. And, besides, it is a fact
well known that in many of the public schools
of the State there are he.d religious exercises
as distinctively sectarian as any church serv
ice. Let those who want sectarian schoois
build them, equip and support them at their
own expense, but not at the expense of the
public.
This writing has been suggested by an item
in this morniug's issue of your paper. It is
there stated that a prominent minister of this
city yesterday "addressed the baccalaureate
6ermon to the students oi the Normal School."
The sermon, as reported, ivas clearly sectarian.
It was delivered, not in the school buildinr,
but in church, where "a block of seats in front
of the pulpit was reserved for the graduates
and their teachers." It was delivered 011 Sun
day at the regular Sunday service, with all
the appendages, it may be presumed, of a
church service.
The characters used in illustration were our
blessed Lord and St. Paul. I think I believe
as strongly in those personages an'l their
teachings as does the speaker of the occasion,
and 1 believe that that teaching ought to be
the rule of our lives. But I do not, therefore,
think it the piorer thing to thrust my belief
before the students of a non-sectarian school,
supported, pro rata, Dy the taxes of Jews and
non-believers.
The constitution of the State guarantees to
the Jew and the non-beÂ«iever that their chil
dren shall not be taught anybody's religious
creed, as It guarantees that same immunity to
every other parent.
It is supposed that the children there are
taught respect for the laws and obedience to
them, and I confess thht it seems to me a
strange way of inculcating that respect and
obedience â by violating them. It is not rignt;
it is not honest. Very respectfully,
George Montgomery,
Bishop of Monterey and Los Angeles.

ENDED HIS DAYS IN VICTORIA.
Death jof " Alabama George," Who Served
on the Cruiser From Which He
Was Nicknamed.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 26.â There
died last night a man whose nickname,
"Alabama George," recalls the famous
Confederate cruiser which, played such
havoc among Northern shipping daring
the civil war in the United States. "Ala
bama George's" name wasHagbert fiansen,
and he was-a Norwegian by birth. In his
younger days he joined the Alabama, and
as one of its crew helped in the capture
of quite a number of Yankee vessels. Only
a few days ago he recalled the fact that
when the Alabama was off the coast of
England, a short time before it met the
Kearsarge, a tug came from shore and
took him and several others of the crew
to land. When they were paid off his
share wai $1200 in prize money.
"Alabama George" lived in a cabin be
hind the Jubilee saloon. On Saturday
evening, while sitting in a chair in the
saloon, he was instantly taken ill. A
policeman was called, and the ex-Con
federate was picked up and carried to his
bed, but he died almost immediately and
before medical aid could be secured.
Heart disease was his ailment.
Ho had been asked by a brother
in North Dakota to go there and live, and
only a few days before his death a ticket
came, of which he had intended to make
use this week.
Turlock Irrijaion Work.
MODESTO. Cal., Jan. 26.â Work on the
much-delayed and much-talked-of con
tract between Judge J. A. Waymire and
the Turlock irrigation district has at last

has agreed to compete the district's sys

the outstanding bonds of the district.
Saunnlito Fishermen Arrested.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Jan. 26.â A raid was
made yesterday nnon fishermen off Sausa
lito by Deputy Fish Commissioner J. H.
Davis. Four men were arrested for fish
ing without licenses and brought before
Justice Pryor. They were: Vincente
Maricano, Giuseppe Maricano, Carlo
Quaterano and Giuseppe Catalano. This
morning the men were re eased upon
paying costs and procuring licenses.
Victoria Inquiry Ended.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 26.â The Bering
Sea Claims Commission transacted no
business this morning, the cases of the
British being now practically completed.
From the number of American witnesses
examined here it is now regarded as en
tirely improbable that the commission
will visit San Francisco.

CARSON, Nev., Jan. 26.â Senator John
P. Jones, the silver champion, was to-day
returned to the upper house of the Na
tional Congress by the lawmakers of Ne
vads. Tliere was no real opposition, the
incumbent getting all but five votes in
both branches of the Legislature. The
two houses will meet in joint session to
morrow and go through the formality of
recasting the ballot and declaring him
their choice.
In the Senate Jones was nominated by
Lord of Storey; William McMillan (R.)
by Summerfield of Wa-<hoe, and Judge
Fitzgerald by Skaggs of Eiko. The vote
resulted: Jones 12, McMillan 2. Fitzger
ald 1. In the Assembly Jones and Mc-
Millan were the nominees. The former
received 28 votes and the latter 2.
Senator Jones will entertain the mem

OH EG OS'S LEGISLATIVE FARCE.
Ttco I/oxvtr Houses of the Legislature in
Session tit Once.
SALEM, Or., Jan. 26.â The regular
House (temporary) was called to order by
Speaker Davis at 9:30 o'clock this morn
ing. After calling the roll the House
adjourned to 9:30 to-morrow.
At 10 o'clock Benson called his House to
order. The roll-call showed thirty-one
members present. The House proceeded
to read petitions praying for a law against
cigarettes and demanding economy.
Several resolutions and bills were intro
duced. Tnere were no new developments.
The House was unyielding, but utterly at a
loss what to do. The Senate is still going
on with its business.
It has now become apparent that no
further attempt will be made by this
House to enforce its recognition by the
Senate, for the sentiment anpears to be
growing that the Benson House is not a
legaiiyconsiituted body. Tne Senate will
sit down upon any attempt to recognize
the House. The business now being trans
acted by the House is looked upon aa a
farce. There is no immediate hope of
electing a United States Senator.

BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 26.â The Populists
in the legislature have returned to their
first choice for Senator, and were joined
by four Democrats in voting for Clagett.
Two ballots were taken, the first resulting
in Clagett receiving 29, Dubois 26, Nel
son (Pop.) 13, scattering 2. Second bal
lot: Clagett 31, Dubois 26, Nelson 12.
; The answer sent by sixteen of the
eiehteen Democratic members of the Leg
islature to Chairman Jones of the Na
i tional Democratic Committee, in which
they absolutely refuse to accede to Jones'
request that they throw their strength to
Duboia, I us proved very discouraging to
the Dubois contingent, for without Demo
cratic aid Dubois cannot be elected. It
looks like a deadlock for an indefinite
period unless the Democrats recede from
their determination not to vote lor Clag
ett. That they may do so at any time
is, however, one of the possibilities. Ii is
the impression to-night that an effort will
be made to-morrow to elect Lewis
(Pop.). _

EUREKA, Cai:, Jan. 26.â county
road which crosses the -Arcata and Mad
River Railroad track just beyond the
bridge where the fatal wreck on that
road occurred last September, came near
being the scene of another disaster last
evening. John and William Underwood,
brothers, residing on Dows ' Prairie, were
going home on horseback from Arcata,
and on reaching the long slope on the
road lead down to the railroad crossing
started to race their horses. As. they
neared the track, the evening train for
Blue Lake came into Bight and so close
was John, whosÂ«Â» horse was in the lead,
that he had barely time to throw him
self out of the saddle before his unfor
tunate mount was struck by the moving
train and instantly killed. The horse's
body falling under the wheels, almost
derailed the train. William, whose horse
was slower, was enabled to check it in
time, and aoing to his brother's assistance
found him painfully bruised and cut by
the fall. . v. ;

*irat Payment on the Lnn&B Ceded to
the Government.
LEWISTON, Idaho, Jan. 36.â One of
the payments to Indians on the â  Nez
Perce reservation for their lands ceded
to the Federal Government a year . ago is
now being made. The total sum to be
disbursed is $180,000. Agent Fisher began
to issue checks to the Indians of the
Lapwai agency reservation .at 9 â  o'clock
this morning. Owing to cold weather, the i
Kamias and other Indians from outside
districts did not appear. About 200 re
ceived their checks. Lewiston bankers
did not make arrangements to cash the
checks at the agency. Some bankers from
rival towns were present. Merchants on
the reservation prepared to accommodate
the customers to facilitate collection.
They paid out $20,000 to-day. Only a
dozen Indians came to this town for iheir
money, and they are '"painting it red."
SANTA BARBARA DEBATES.
Men of Learning Discuss Economic
. Frcb/ems Before the Social
* Labor Society.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 26â No
local controversy in recent years has
creatad such a lively interest as the social
problem now being debated under the
auspices of the Social Labor Party of
Santa Barbara, This society started last
November with a small membership, but
now the largest hall la too small to ac
commodate its members, and those drawn
to its meetings by curiosity.
The principal speaker last nifjbt was
F. M. GalÃiher, who read on "More or
less Slate Control," which brought forth
a lon;,' controversy and searching criticism.
The import of the paper was that the
minority, being the better educated and the
wiser, must replace in power the majority
which was rushing headlong after an im
possible happiness that no legislation
could obtain. H. J. Weeks ridiculed the
idea that the majority could not be
trusted. He in turn was followed by a dozen
others, some among the most talented of
Santa Barbara's people, who are now
thoroughly interested in this movement.
The Rev. F. S. Forbes closed the de
bate in a sarcastic vein, stating that he
did not sea why a voor man should be
favored more than a rich one; why a man
who stole a State should be confined in
the United Statt-s Senate and a man who
stole a loaf of bread oe supported in a
State hotel; why a man who Btole a rail
road should be compelled to ride in a
palace car, while a man who stole a ride
should live at a public hotel supported by
the people. He said these things might
be natural and that the leopard could not
change his spots, but he thought the
people could spot the leopard.

STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 26.â The session

priated for the library fund. After a
vigorous debate the question of maintain
ing a free Hebrew school was defeated.
This was one of the most hotly contested
of the subjects that came before the ses
sion, as the next meeting- place of the
Grand Lodge, Portland, Or., was to-night
selected.
After the adjournment the deleeates re
paired to the residence of Moses Marks,
where a reception was tendered the YisiM
ors and their friends by M. P. Stein, the
newly elected president of the order. An
impromptu musical and literary pro
gramme had been prepared, and the affair
was one of the most enjoyable in the his
tory of the organization.

MILL VALLEY, Cal., Jan. 26.â
Monte Vista Hotel, situated on Throck

number of physicians who had become
interested in the proposition. ,
Tat*i Kern's Grand Jury.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Jan. 26.â The
last ot the famous "long" Grand Jury
indictments met an inglorious fate last
niuht, when it took a trial jury less than
five minutes to find Superintendent
of Schools Harrell not guilty of
the charge of misappropriating public
funds. The indictment was based upon
the evidence of Expert Edgar Moore
of Los Angeles, and he bad become so
thoroughly discredited in the previous
cases that no weight was attached to his
testimony. The acquittal lollowed almost
as a matter of course. Every indictment
found by that Grand .Jury has now been
disDOsed of, and the result has in every
case been the sameâ prompt acquittal aa
soon as the trial jury could take a vote.
Atti-mped Suicide at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 26.â A
young woman, evidently insane, made
two attempts to commit suicide on the
outskirts of the city yesterday afternoon.
Sue stood on the railroad track in from
of an approaching freight train. The
train was stopped just in time. The fire
man got out and iield the woman until
the train passed. The outgoing train
rner. another at Brighton. The trainmen
informed the incoming crew, putting them
on their guard. When the girl made a
second attempt she was taken on board
and brought to the city, whence she was
sent to the County Hospital. She is a
stranger, and refused to give her name.

Wallace, the Por land man who claimed
to nave been the victim of a sensational
highway robbery near iiere a few days
aeo, is in serious trouble. He has been

in Butte County to be used for a few days
and then returned, but that he did not
return the animal or pay fc its use.
Wallace and bis wife were very indignant
over his arrest, claiming that it was due
to spitework. Wallace acted so queerly
about tbe alleged robbery many here
discredit the entire story.

ROASTED IN HIS
BURNING HOME
Nathan B. Dimmick's Body
Found Wrapped in
Flames.
Murder or Suicide of an Aged
Capitalist of Santa
Cruz.
Kerosene Oil Poured Over the Floors
of His Dwelling to Hasten
Its Destruction.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 2a â The
body of Nathan B. Dimmick, burned to a
crisp, was discovered in hia burning
dwelling east of this city this afternoon
by two neighbors. The surroundings in
dicated either murder or suicide.
The body was lying face downward on
the parlor floor. Both that room and the
bedroom adjoining were ablaze, but the
firemen soon quenciied the flames, which
did not reach the other portions of the
building. A large tin bucket near the
body appeared to have contained kero
sene.
Dimmick was 64 years of age and had
been married twice. His first wife died a
year ago and two months ago he married
Mrs. H. B. Herrick. He was well-to-do,
and the couple lived on his income. They
were preparing to move to San Diego.
About 2 o'clock this afternoon Mrs.
Dimmick came to town, leaving Mr. Dim
nr.c-k at home, as he complained of head
ache and said be would lie down and
sleep. His gold watch, which was found
near the body, had stopped at 2:45, indi
cating the probable time of his death.
A. A. Day, a neighbor, saw Dimmick
enter the house from the rear. Five
minutes later the fire broke out. Day gave
the alarm, and with several neighbors,
burst in the door.
In the sitting-room they found a five
gallon oil can with a large hole cut in the
top through which the oil had been
emptied.
Another can in the woodshed had been
cut into with a spade and part of its con
tents poured out, presumably into the
bucket found in the parlor. A broom
standing near by bore evidence of having
been used to spread the oil.
The position.of the body does not favor
the theory of suicide, for which no ap
parent cause existed.
On the other hand the gold watch and
$18 in gold and silver found on the body
are evidence that if a murder were com- :
mitted the object was not robbery. The I
body was so badly burned that it could
not be ascertained if any wounds bad
been inflicted. The men who ran to the
rescue are quite positive that all the doors
were locked on the inside.
Pendleton Defaulter Sentenced.
PENDLETON, Ok.. Jan. 26.â Gaorge R.
Lash, the defaulting City Recorder, was
this morning sentenced to three years and
six months in the penitentiary, and fined
$4000. The court instructed the Grand
jury to make a searching investigation
into the charges that other town officials
are implicated in the defalcation.

trunt it is proposed to erect a big club
house and other improvements for a New
York sportsmen's society. The improve
ments will cost 150,000.

TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 26.â Mrs. Hattie
Morrill, wife of W. I*. Morrill of Santa

surgical operation to remove a cancer.
Her husband was present.

QUEENSTOWN, Ireland. Jan. 26â The

British ship Ditton, which sailed from
San Francisco on the same day. The
latter vessel has not yet been sighted.

Paine's Celery Compound Is Working
Miracles in Curing Disease.
Paine's celery compound is working
miracles in the cure of disease!
So saya a recent article by ths foremost
medical essayist in Boston.
"Nothing shows more conclusively," he
adds, "the astonishing capability ot
Paine's celery compound than the thought-
ful, open-minded clas3 of poople who use
it and recommend it, both in public and
among their closest and dearest friends
and relatives. Among us (physicians)
there is no longer any hesitancy in recom-
mending this â¢greatest remedy without
stint of praise."
About the same time the above article
â¢was published tnere appeared in the Bos-
ton Journal the following letter from
David K. Chasser of 452 Windsor street,
Cambridgeport, a suburb of Boston:
"I take great pleasure in testifying to

efforts proved of no avail. I have been

vortised medicines, but having stiff ered
excruciating pains in the bead, which tbe
doctors informed me were due to neural-
gic symptoms, I determined to try Maine's
celery compound on the advice of a friend.
"To my surprise I found an entire
change going on afier taking a little over
three bottles and I beean to feel like a
new man. I have for tbe past 10 or 12
years suffered from pains in the back and
other symptoms of derangement of the
kidneys and bladder, and hive spent many
sleepless nights in consequence, but now I
sleep sound, thanks to tfie common sense
which induced me to try Paine's celery
compound. I will ev3r praise the marvel-
ous potency of this valuable medicine,
and at any time will be glad to give per-
sona! testimony at my address should any
sufferer care to call, as I consider it selfish
to keep sach a blessing boused up, and
think the proprietors of Paine's celery
compound deserving of more thanks than
I can convey in words for making me a
new man."
A word to other sufferers:
Go to your druggist for a bottle of
Paine's celery compound, and allow him
to apll you nothing else !

HAS PASSED
His Funeral Made a Gay
Holiday in China
town.
THE CAMERA FIEND IN
CLOVER.
While the Widow and Her Chil
dren Wept the See Yups
Celebrated.
A HOB AT THE CEMÂ£TERY
PLAYS HAVOC.
The Police Have Secur d Another
Suspect â He Is Gee Pon J n, and
Is Well Identified.
The funeral of Little Pete yesterday
i formed the occasion of a heathen holiday.
When any great thine shall happen in
Chinatown in the years to come and some
word shall be wanted to draw comparison
of the interest manifested, it will be set
alongside of "the day that Little Pete was
buried."
From tbe lighting of tbe first taper
on the curb in front of the closed shop
where ha was shot to death until the
mob charged, almost over his coffin, at
the cemetery, carrying away tbe baked
meats and putting to rout the mourners,
the affair was an altogether notable one
in funerals.
Little Pete was not a good man in his
lifetime, but he had a pall and it made
him great. Perhaps in his wicked way
he was great in the first instance, and tnat
secured him the pull. At any rate he was
great, at the last, in Chinatown, and his
greatness, testified to by a funeral a mile |
lone, was the cause of bis undoing and
precipitated the funeral upon him pre
maturely.
To the matter-of-fact native a Chinese
funeral, with its barbaric rites and color,
and incense and chanting, is always inter
esting, but the interest attaching to Little
Pete himself and his killing being added
in t'lis instance made it a gala day in
Chinatown.
Ail tbe night before there bad been go
ing on in the street in front of the build
ing where the murder was done, and
where the body now lay, those familiar j
preliminary rites, the burning of punk, j
the clang of cymbals, the incantation of !
the priests and the offering to the gods !
of fruits and meats and drinks. For the
body had been brought from the Morgue
and lay in the shoe factory on the second J
floor that had been owned by the schem- j
jne little Chinaman.
On the floor above, in the two little j
â joms that had been their home, the wife j
and her children and her friends kept up i
an intermittent moaning.
In tbe ovens and bakeshops of tbe neigh
borhood great preparations were going
forward, for unheard of quant iti s of
meat and pastry had to be prepared for j
the appeasing of the ravenous appetites of
tbe gods and their consequent propitia- I
tion in behalf of the very unsavory record ;
of Little Pete.
Then there were great numbers of
gowns to be stitched together for the ,
mourners, real and purchased.
Yesterday morning early the real ser
vices began, although the hour fixed for j
the funeral was at 1 of the afternoon. The
leather and tbe machines and all the work
of the factory had been cleared away as i
much as possible and the handsome black j
Funeral Procession of "Little Pete" as It Started From His Late Residence and Scene of the Murder on Washington^Street.
metallic casket placed in an "L" of the
low ceiled gloomy room in front of the
windows. Banked about the head were a
profusion of flowers in costly designs, from
the friends of the deceased, in white and
yellow.
At the foot of the casket were number?
j of colored candles and burning sticks of
punk that weighted the already heavy
atmosphere with their smoke and in
cense. A: the dark, rear end of the big
room sufpended near the rafters was an
altar with the images of heathen gods and
more candles and more punk.
In the corner of the room opposite to
where the casket stood were scattered the
widow and children and their supporters,
the professional mourners, the latter
wearing blue wrappeis and flowing white
headdresses.
The widow wore over all ajjhood and
wrapper of sackcloth, which enveloped
and concealed l:er. The children were
dressed in like manner, exceiit that their
faces were not hidden. The party were
grouped upon thm;- knees upon a mat,
and kept up a constant and subdued
lamentation, which served as an accom
paniment to the incantations of the priest.
Men dresssed in blue and white gowns
stood as sentinels by the casket, and the
brother of the dead man stepped about
giving directions.
A long procession of men, friend s of the
! deceased, at a given signal came into the
! room, and two by two knelt before thje
foot of the casket, taking their last fare
well.
All this time the door from the street
was open, and those whites as well as
Chinese who had the proper influence
with the policeman on guard had admit
tance. Their tobacco smoke mingled
with that of the burning punk. They
shuffled about tosether, few of them think
ing to uncover their head*, but all lost
in Tvatching the curious spectacle that
was passing. On the boxes and perched
upon the heaps of leather and findings in
thÂ« r-mote corners of the black and
grimy factory were pigtails of low degree,
quite as much interested as the whites, to
whom it was all less familiar. Through
the crowd on the floor there struggled now
and then one of those white women of
I Chinatown to whom it is said "Little
! Pete" in his lifetime had been very
I generous. One of them brought to his
i casket a littls bunch of flowers.
In thi" setting, his fieure half revealed
through the glass cover, the dead man's
powder-stained face looked up to the
smoky rafters, the round hole in his fore
nead telling its own story.
Outside the street was blocked for
squares away. A squad of twenty-rive
policemen found it impossible to keep the
tliorouirhfare open. Every window on
j the street and every dcor and lamppost
was occupied, and housetops all up and
down the street were fringed with peonle.
Business in a large part of Chinatown was
practically suspended.
And just around the corner, at the
headquarters of the See Yup Tong, that
plotted and executed the murder of Little
Pete, was in progress at that very moment
a celebration of the event.
Wnile his friends mourned the members
of the highbinder society made little con
cealment even in public of their joy at
the success of their undertaking. So ap
pare.it was this that it was fearei there
j might be some interference with the
i funeral ceremony, and this, besides the
! anticipation of the crowds that might, be
collecte I, decided the directors upon hold
ing aji tbe services within doors.
The police were feopt busy in their en
j deavor to keep people moving so that a
| way might be left for the hearse and the
I carriages of the mourners. Only these
j attempted to come into Washington
i street, they being statior.ed and receiving
j their occupants in the remote side streets.
Shortly after 1 o'clock the procession
started. It was ied by a platoon of police,
who forced the way open. A brass band
followed. Carriages containing the floral
â  gifts preceded the hearse. This latter was j
! drawn by six black horses caparisoned in I
I black trappings. Following came the
mourners, coisy in their lamentations,
and then tbe gongs and symbols and all
â  the rest of it. As they moved away from
I the nouse it wa>> cleared of thp evil spirits
! that came with death by an explosion of
j firecrackers.
The procession moved up to Stockton
street ana north to Montgomery avenue,
| thence to Dupont street, to Post and
j thence west to the cemetery. The mourn
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1897.
ers walked over all this route to Post
street, where they were lifted into cov
ered express wagons, and in that shape,
signifying their sorrow, were carried to
the cemetery.
There the crush was almost as great as
it had been in the City.
The Sam Yap cemetery is a little patch
of ground adjoining the Jewish cemetery
at the further limits of Richmond. The
purpose of going there was not to inter
the body, but only to complete the funeral
ceremony, for afterward the body was
taken back to the undertaker's, there to
remain some time and be finally sent to
China.
The road leading to the cemetary was
darkened for a mile by people who fol
lowed the slow procession. They came
by streetcar, on bikes and by private con
veyance, and when the hearse drew up at
the gate, the platform provided for the
casket and the mourners and the priest
had already been pre-empted. A mounted
policeman rode into the mass before it
would disperse. At one end of the plat
form was an immense table, and upon
this was 9prend the roast pigs and shoep,
poultry, trays of rice and of tea and gin,
that weighted down several wagons in
their transportation.
The casket was put in place, and the
mourners took their places about it, and
were so pressed upon by the crowd as to
be scarcely able to retain their places.
The bonfire that makes a part of the cere
mony had to be lit at a considerable dis
tance away. People climbed upon the
monuments th.it flank the place and
broke down some trees in the neighbor
hood, trying to hang on to the branchei.
The ceremony was shortened on this ac
count.
Then come the most remarkable scene
of all. Immediately upon the removal of
the casket to the hearse again and the
withdrawal of the mourners to their bag
gace-wagon, the crowd developed into a
mob and made a rush upon the table
tilled with meats. A woman started it.
She wanted a souvenir of the funeral of
Little Pete and, stepping forward, took
one of the little vessels that make a part
of the spread. The crowd yelled and in
two minutes the table was swept clear of
the more portable things.
A man picked up a dish of rice and
threw it over the crowd, creating a panic.
The mounted policeman, who had ridden
away, escorting the mourners, hearing
the noise, returned in time to see four
men dragging away the carcass of a
roast hoe. He dashed through the crowd,
overtook and compelled them to carry it
back again, amid the hoots of the crowd.
Tftus ended the public funeral service of
Little Pete. The throng strangled bsck
to town, carrying with it a sense of hav
ing been well entertained.
For three days the widow will make
lamentations at the undertaking estab
lishment, and then the body will hÂ«
placet* iii a receiving vault at Laurel Hill
until, the estate having b^en settled up,
it will be -eat to China, and widow and
children will go with it.
The Chinese New Year will be^in on
Monday. It has been stated that the
widow of Little Pete has expressed a wil
lingness to go home during the tirrft
month of the new year, taking with her
but $10,000, and that she wishes the re
mainder used in paying legal fees, funeral
expenses and costs of settling up affairs in
general, but principally to be used in the
detection, arrest and prosecution of her
husband's murderer.
HIS HEATHEN PRAYER.
I Something: of the Meaning of the
Ritual Performed Over "Little
Pete's" Remains.
The incantation of the prest in yester
day's ceremony consisted of the Faoist
chant, and it was accompanied with a
pair of rosewood clappers. The chant is
adopted from tne Sanskrit, and none but
! the priests themselves can understand the
' literai signification.
The meaning of tbe chant of the priest
is simply that of a prayer. In it he be
seeches the Chinese Pluto, Yung Loh
Wong, to be merciful to the spirit of the
I dead man.
ANOTHER SUSPECT.
Gee Pon Jin In Jail at tho Instance
of Frank Mason.
Another Mongolian of vicious appear
ance is confined in the tanks of the City
Prison under suspicion of having fired to*
shots that closed the career of "Little
Pete." He is known by his fellow pagan
associates as Gee Pon Jin. The police ac
cept the name as correct, as it is of slight
importance.
They Know him to be a member of the
Suey Sing Tong, a reckless man in high
binder controversy, and have a fairly
good case against him, so they are con
tent.
Frank Mason, an ex-fireman, is the
most important witness against the pris
oner. Us had passed through Ross alley
into Washington street on the night of
the murder, and was standing near the
barber-shop when "Little Pete" was shot
to death.
Two Chinamen, one of them the assas
sin, sprang from the doorway and hur
ried past the ex-fireman. Plenty of ligln
was stiining from the windows on the
street, and Mason impressed the features
of the fleeing hiehbinders on his mind.
Since that time Mason has been fre
quenting tbe Mongolian quarters, hoping
to meet the Chinaman he iiad seen hurry
ing from the scene of the killing. Last
evening he was successiul and noticed
Gee Pon Jin entering a tenement house at
824 Washington street. He notified Officer
W. H. Young and they returned to the
lodging-house together.
After a ciimb up a dark flight of stairs,
the policeman and his informant located
the room entered by the desired China
man. He was sitting among a dozen of
his fellow countrymen. Mason pointed
him out, and he was placed under arrest.
Sergeant Mooney of Â«he Chinatown squad
was informed of the arrest and will trace
Gee Pou Jin's movements since the mur
der.
MANY MEN GUARDED.
Chinatown R sts Under an Awful
Suspense.
Larking in the dimly lighted streets and
dark, foui-smelJing alleys of Chinatown
are scores of highbinders thirsting for the
lucre that will come into their itching
palms by the shedding of hnman blood.
M an v of tnese fiends in human shape are
strangers to the denizens of the Chinese
quarter â hatchetmen brought from the
interior and coast 'owns for a price to
avenee the death of "Little Pete."
Foremost among the men marked for
slaughter is Chin Hen Shin, better known
as "Big Jim," a man reputed to be worth
nearly a million dollars, lie owns a club
house on Waverly place, various business
houses and banks and extensive property
in Cnina.
Everywhere "Big Jim" goes he is closely
guarded by a Caucasian. Profiting by the
carelessness of "Little Pete," "Big Jim"
â¢ never permits his guard out of sight for an
instant.
The Sam Yups have nothing in par
ticular against the Celestial in Question,
but he is the richest and most influential
man among the See Yups, and that has
branded him. The price on His head is
$5000.
Then there is Ung Hung, commonly
known as "t!ie Russian," interpreter and
policeman for me 1 Sain Yups and a per
sonal friend of "Little Pete." He must
die. the See Yups say, because he knows
too much about the murder and may
choose to tell it at any time. His bead is
worth just $2500 to some Jiighbinder, and
is considered cheap at that, because be
was instrumental in the arrest of the two
suspects now in jail. Hung, however, has
employed Tom Douglas, son of Captain
Douglas, as bodyguard.
A price of $2000 also rests on the head
of Sin Goon, a r.urrn pe:*on:ii friend of
"Little Pete." He has employed* Tom
Conboy as guard, and the two are more
inseparable than schoolboy chums.
Done Gong, the Chinese interpreter,
never goes out witbout a guard, and sel
dom is *een on the streets at all. Guards,
in fact, ard a regular fad in Chinatown
now.
So bitter is the feud that a See Yu p
translator, who was present to act as trans
lator of the priest's sermon at Pete's
funeral, was complained of to Attorney
Riordan, and asked by that gentleman to
leave in order to avoid trouble.
The See Yupi say they have all those
who took a prominent part in the arrange
ments lor Pete's funeral mentally noted,
and they will probably prepare the por
tion of lead due them.

TO BOND THE CITY
FOR SEW SEWERS
Many Objections Will Be
Raised to the Prepo
sition.
The Improvement Is Very Ne
cessary, but the Method
li Questioned.
Several Citizsns Believe Tbat the
Supervisors Are Beginning at
the Wrong End.
The resolution passed by the Board of
Supervisors on Monday lookinc to the
bonding of th <â¢ City in order to raise funds
for ihe creation of a modern sewer system
was the subject of much comment yester
day amonÂ« people conversant with large
engineering undertakings. The resolution
was that the Supervisors ask the Legisla
ture to pass an act to submit to the taxpay
ers a proposition to issue 4 per cent bonds
to run forty years.
In addition to the plan to complete a
sewer system compatible with the City's
growth and needs the Supervisors put on
a rider by adding, "and to clear itself
(San Francisco) of a just indebtedness
wnich was contracted in the legitimate
pursuit of its business." This last clause
may provoke some opposition, for a num
ber of the business men of this Ciiy be
lieve that this just indebtedness may be
provided lor in otaer ways than by bond
ing.
Whatever may be the result of the reso
lution it 13 safe to say that it will be at
least half a dozen years and maybe more
before San Francisco has a complete or
even a partly completed sewer system.
C. Ev aid Grunsky, the civil engineer, is
probably one of the most enlightened men
on the sewer system of this City, for lie
has made an official examination of the
entire matter, and his report to the Board
of Supervisors is in the municipal reports
of 1893-94.
In 1892 the Supervisors created a com
mission of three to investigate the sower
system of this City. The Commissioners
we r e Colonel George H. Mendeli, Professor
George Davidson ami Irving M. Scott.
They selected as active engineers C. E.
Grnnsky and Marsden Manson.
The two labored hard and found th*
task even greater t tan tliey had antici
pated. To their surprise they found that
the Ci'y had practically no records of its
sewer system as to the size thereof, grades,
how constructed or of the existence of
sewers in some streets at all.
In consequence the engineers were
obliged to go over the entire City to obtain
the necessary data. To say that they found
the system, if such it can be called, in a
wretched condition, would be putting it too
mildly.
Speaking of the matter of bonding the
City, Mr. Grunsky said: "The City can

or plans btiscd upon a definite project, and
this project snou d be evolved by compe
tent engineers. Before even thinking of
the bonding matter, a commission should
have at least two years to form a plan for
a system , find the engineers would require
at least $10,000 to perform their work prop
erly. ''
Julian Sonntae, president of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, is
an enthusiastic advocate of the bonding
proposition, for he said: "I believe that it
is just, and I would hail such an act with
greut satisfaction. With a proper sewer
age system I am sure that the mortality
of this City would be decreased oy 15 per
cent. During the past few months the
death rate Irom diphtheria and kindred
diseases that arise from impurities such
such as this City is subject to has been 21
in 1000. Think of it. That this City is
sadly in need of a perfect modern sewer
system goes without saying. There would
be no trouble in bonding the City; that is
the public would not object to such a
Course if it was known that the work
would be done without the usual jobbery.
Nearly all the opposition that comes from
the people is caused by the fear that for
every dollar's wortn of work actually per

"If this proposition assumes favorable
shape I will have a proposition to sub
mit to the Manufacturers and Producers'
Association with a view of having it sub
mitted oy this body to the Board of Su
pervisors. The purpose is to throw such
safeguards nronnd the whole matter as
w.ll prevent jobbery. Mv proposition is
this: That the Board of Supervisors en
iist the good offices of Senators Perkins
and White in a request to the Federal
Government to secure the services of two
or more United States Engineers from the
army corps who will exercise a superin
tendency of the construction of the sewer
svdtero of [his City. I would have the
Supervisors piace the entire matter of con
structing the sewerage system in the
hands of the Mayor and these army engi
neers suggested. My reason for wanting
the Feilera! engineers to take practical
charge of the work iÂ« because these army
effi' era, who hold office for life, either in
active service or under a pension when
they grow old, cannot be corrupted by
con tractors or political jobbers. If this
matter takes definite shape I believe that
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation will stand by the suggestion in the
interests of honesty. Unless sometning
of this kind is done I am afraid that it
will be the same old story of fleecing the
taxpayers in the interests of the political
jobbers and contractor."
President Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association shook his head when the
proposition of raisinc funds by issuing
City bonds was made to him and he said:
"I am in favor of the City paving its debts
as soon as it can. lam mo.-t heartily in
favor of an improved and perfected sew
erage system and the issuing of bonds for
that purpose; but as to the present sug
gestion for raising money by bonding the
City lam opposed to it. What is my rea
son? It is this: We are not prepareu to
do so now. It is not the proper time. Be
fore the City can be I onded we must have
a better municipal syst m of government,
a new charter and a general better busi
ness system under which such business
can be transacted. If we bond the City in
our present condition difficulties and tan
gles of a most complex and embar
rassing nature will arise."
President Dohrmann, in discussing the
Eewerage system, gave expression to tne
views that are >et forth in the udvance
copy of the Merchants' Association's Re
view ot February, which reads as follows:
The probiem of devising a correct system of
sewerage lor San Francisco is one of such
great magnitude as io require most careful
consideration. No hasty or ill-advised plans
should be adopted. We believe that the ap
pointment of thy competent engineers in 1892
to investigate the condition and actual needs
ot the sewerage system of ban Francisco was a
step in the right direction. We strongly rec
ominead that a commission of the most cap
able and re iable on?lneers be appointed by
the City to continue the work begun by the
previous sewerage emmission.
Alter a careful and thorough report has been
ofnciaUy made by a commission of the most
trustworthy engineers, the City authorities
shouid cant ouÂ«ly proceed to provide ways
aud menus for the construction o' a correct
system of sewerage. The cost ot this immense
improvement would be too great to be raised
by ordinary luxation in oik- year or several
fiscal years, but should be provided by bond
ing the City for a sufficient amount as pre
scribed by law. Posterity would enjoy the un
told blessings of an improved sewerage system
equally as much us the pre-ent generation,
and, therefore, the expense should be justly
distributed over a long period of years.
Resuming, President Dobrmann said
that when Mr. Grunsky and Mr. Manson
made their report of the cost of and Dlajis
fora perfect sewerage system the City cut
the work off, and since then nothing has
been done in that line. The Merchants' As
sociation proposes to petition the Board of
Supervisors to have the work taken un
where it was left off several years ago, and
thereby save the trouble of going all over
the same ground again. The association
will ask that a commission to this end be
appointed to lnok into the cost and re
quirements of tms much-needed improve
ment, and then for the City io be slow
and cautious in the manner of baying me
work^one. For such work the City will
no doub: have to be bonded, but the City
should not be bonded for old debts, which
should be prov.ded for in other ways. In
addition to the recommendation by the
association set forth that body would in
clude m the object of the bonds such
matters as the improvement of streets,
better pavements and the repairing of the
principal streets uf the City.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The Legislature is dull, Dut that is a
good sign.
Trade promises to blossom oat this
spring like a sunflower.
It is now said ofjthe Legislatme that it
does not talk, but it works.
The Nicaragua canal bilL hag still
enough life left in it to kick.
It takes a blizzard to fan the embers of
Chicago charity, but it can do it.
Little Pete has been buried, and now
how long will it take us to bury his mur
derers?
Spain continues to talk of reforms for
Cuba, but the Cubans insist on making
it a revolution, and there you are.
It is now reported that McKinley has
said that all talk about his Cabinet is
"mere gossip," but that also may be gos
sip.

has an economic value just read the re
ports of tbe condition of workingmen in

Ex-Queen Liiioukalani made her call
upon Cleveland and he showed his hand.
He also said it was a glad one, but that
may have been a bluff.
While they are shivering with blizzards
in the East, we hnve on this side the
mountains just enough snow and ice to
make a Truckee festival.
A bill has been introduced into the Ne
vada Legislature bearing the title, "An
act to restrict and license glove contests,"
and the emphasis is on the license.
If there is no worse scandal affecting
tin* Legislature than that of the payroll
there will be more satisfaction in the State
than has been known in a long time.
What is the use of announcing that
Cnnrles W. Fairchild, the newly elected
Senator from Indiana, was born in Ohio?
Isn't it always an Ohio man who gets
there?
There have been so many hold-ups in
Chicago of late that nearly every man in
town has provided himself with a pistol,
;ind the gun-dealers are calling it a trade
revival.
It goes without saying that the investi
gation of the stuffed payroll must be
made in public. The people demand that
the examination shall be as open 83 the
offense.
The public schools should not be closed
for a month, neither should they be kept
open at the expense of the teacher". It is
a poor town that cannot run its schools on
a proper basis.
Senator Chandler avows a determina
tion to prevent what he calls "the whole
sale larceny of senatorships," but he
would do better if he could prevent the
larceny of Senators.
The Supreme Court has decided that a
sailor who refuses to fulfill his contract to
serve on board a vessel must go to jail,
but if a shipmaster should refuse to keep
his contract with a sailor would he go to
jail? _
The German physician, who claims to
have discovered that all people in this
country have what he calls "Americanit

it a disease. Americanitis is the vigor of
sanguine healthfulness.
The Kansas legislator who is trying to
achieve fame by presenting a bill makine
it a misdemeanor for a woman to ride a

famous if he will devise a plan by which
a girl can ride the wheel in any other way.
Senator Turpie turns from a three days'
speech against the Nicaragua canal bill to
make another long one on Cuba with all
tbe ease of a man who has versatility
enough for all things and assurance
enougii to regard the Senate as his private
talking rink.
In declaring the Southern Pacific Com
rany to be an unlawful organization,
having violated both Federal and State
laws, the attorneys for the Railroad Com
mission have struck tbe nail on the head

cnn drive it home and clinch it.
Dun's Etview calls attention to the fact
that "the greatest growth and prosperity
the country had ever seen came suddenly
in 1879 after several months of disappoint
ment because specie resumption had not
yet brought the benefits expected." There
is a promising chance that something of
the same kind may happen this year.
From 8t Paul to Galveston ther* has
come upon the East a dread severity of
cold; not like a wave that passes, but like
a spell that has come to stay and intends
to enter every home that is not carefully
guarded. Truly it is good to live on this
side of the mountains. There is wisdom
and profit in it as well as joy and pleasure.
Since the Atlanta Constitution con
siders the town has grown large enough to
justify it in publishing an evening paper
in competition with Moke Smith's Journal
it is probable that late statesman will re
gard it as big enough to support another
morning paper. When newspaper de-
Telopments get started they multiply
rapidly.
THE EASTERN BLIZZAEDS.
The severe cold which prevails in the
East at this time seems to be in many re
spects almost unprecedented. The extent
of territory covered by it reaches from Bt.
Paul, Minn., to Galveston, Texas. It has
involved in an equal suffering the great
cities of Chicago and New York and the
sparsely settled prairies of Western Ne
braska and Kansas. In some places there
has been enow sufficient to destroy flocks
of sheep and in other places where snow
was needed to protect the winter wtieat
there has not been enough to save those
crops from destruction.
Even the most casual reading of reports
from the various sections of the East shows
how great is the economic value of the
equable climate of California. Even if
the element of human comfort is left out
side of consideration there is still enough
in the contrast between our conditions on
this side the mountains and that which
prevails eastward to demonstrate that our
climate in the winter is worth to us many
millions of dollars annually.
With the coming of the blizzards there
has beon an appeal throughout the East for
charity. This appeal seems to be in every
way urgent and pressing. It is not merely
the thriftless and idle vagrants of human
ity who are suffering now in the great
cities, but industrious workingmen and
their families. The Mayor of Chicago es
timates that it will require not less than
$100,000 to meet the temporary demand for
supplies to prevent the starvation and
freezing of thousands of people in that
city. Pititul stories of destitution are re
ported from the prairie States and well
to-do farmers find it as necessary to be
prompt in their charity to their poorer
neighbors as do the wealthy residents of
great cities.
Fortunately these appeals for charity
will not be made in vain. Everywhere,
from Minnesota to Texas and from Ne
braska to Massachusetts, there will be not
only hearts prompt to sympathize with
the poor, but hands ready to help them.
The telegraph, by making known the
wide extent of the suffering, serves to im
press the public mind with its greatness,
and thereby impels them to be active in
their efforts to save. The extreme suffer
ing as a consequence wili not be great nor
very much prolonged. American charity
has never yet failed to be equal to any
disaster that has befallen its people, and
in that well-established truth people of
the East may find some consolation amid
the storms that surround them.
In the meantime, as a matter of human
charity as well as of business, it would be
well for boards of trade, chambers of com
merce and the press of California to call
the attention of the Eastern people to the
fact that they can gain immunity from
storms by making their homes in this
State. There is no reason why any man
of moderate means or of comparative
wealth should remain in a land where he
is exposed to blizzards and storms when
he can mate his home in a land of winter
sunshine without forfeiting his allegiance
to his country and his flag. Eastern
charity can save many people from the
worst effects of the storm at present, but
the only way for them to find permanent
relief is to come West.
MANUFACTURERS' CONVENTION.
The second annual convention of the
American Association of Manulacturers,
which met at Philadelphia yesterday, will
be one of more than ordinary interest. It
assembles at a time when Congress is pre
paring a tariff which will seriously affect
the interest of all manufacturers in the
country, and therefore its proceedings
wili be naturally directed to politics as
well as to business.
While the open hearings before the
Committee of Ways and Means in Con
gress, which is preparing the new tariff
bill, have been closed, there can be no
question tnat the members of that com
mittee will gladly recsive and carefully
consider any recommendations which
may be made by a body of such import
ance as this convention. In a certain
sense therefore the delegates at Philadel
phia will have something of practical
legislation on their hands. It will be an
opportunity for them to make clear to the
Ways and Means Committee what degree
of protective duties is necessary to the
welfare of American manufacturers, and
to protect it not only from Europe, but
from the growing competition ol China
and Japan.
It is more than probable the convention
will recommend the creation of * Secretary
of Commerce, to have a seat in the Cabinet
and to share in directing the affairs of the
Nation. Such an official has been called
for for some time and the creation of the
office has long been a subject of Congres
sional consideration. The advocates of
the measure have good reasons to support
it, and it is certain that sooner or later it
will have to be adopted
As the United States increases in wealth
and population and grows both in the
extent and variety of its industries there
is necessarily a demand for new depart
ments of Government supervision. We
recognize in the West the urgent need of
a Secretary of Mines and Mining and can
well appreciate the desire in the creat
manufacturing States for a Secretary of
Commerce. The United States can well
afford both tbese officials. There would
be more economy in paying the officers
required to perform the duties of the new
departments than in leaving tbese vast
industries without the supervision neces
sary for their best development.
SUBSTITUTION.
The practice of inconsiderate retailers
in attempting to substitute untried patent
articles for those of established reputation
is not only an evil of long standing, but is
one of growing injury to all parties con
cerned. The producers of such articles,
the newspapers which advertise them and
the public which buys them are all af
fected to their loss by the practice of subÂ»
stitution, and it is also easy of demonstra
tion that the retailers themselves who
engage in such practice are injuring their
business.
To bring a new remedy or a new food
into general use there are necessary three
things. First, that the new article shall
be extensively advertised; second, that it
shall be of sufficient merit to win popular
favor after having been tested, and third,
that the retail dealer shall supply it to
his customers when called for. If the re
tailer takes advantage of the presence of
his customer, who has come to purchase
a specific article, to coax him into buying
something else, he to that extent injures
tbe advertiser and tends to diminish the
cause which brought the customer to his
store.
Buyers can easily see how great is the
harm done to them by this practice of
substituting inferior articles for those of
established repute. Men and women who
have been made the victims of this prac
tice will not care to return to stores and
shops where it has been imposed on them.
Thua the dealer who has been successful
in one sale loses the chance of making
many others. He has been "penny wise
and pound foolish, "as the old proverb
has it He has made one sale of the sub
stitute, but lost a good customer and the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1897.
sale of dozens of packages of the estab
lished article.
The affairs of this world are so closely
associated that the interest of one legiti
mate industry is inseparably associated
with the interests of all other legitimate
industries. When a wrong is done to onn
all allied enterprises suffer. In the sale of
patented articles the producer of the
article, the newspaper in which it is ad
vertised, the dealer and the customer for
it have clearly one and the same interest.
If the producer finds that by advertising
he does not gain customers in a certain
community he sood ceases to advertise in
the papers of that community. The pub
lic is thus deprived of the knowledge of an
important article of beneficial use. and
the dealer loses the opportunity to sell
not only that article but even the inferior
thing which he has been substituting for
it.
It ought not to be necessary to point out
to intelligent dealers the wrong they are
doing to their own trade by the practice
of substitution. They reap the benefit of
all the advertising which is given to the
genuine article, and it is to their ad
vantage to have that advertising con
tinued. The dealer who intentionally
lessens the sale of an advertised article re
stricts his own business and injures his
own purse. There ought to be enough
business sense among retail dealers to
understand this and a sufficient apprecia
tion of the importance of the subject to
impel them to act together to put an end
to a practice so hurtful to all concerned.

A correspondent of the New York Tribune, from West Virginia, writes as follows: "The
mention of Judge Nathan Goff for a Cabinet position pleases the people of West Virginia,
and his appointment to sucU a position will
meet with the hearty approval of all West Vir
ginia Republicans. One of the Incidents in
Judge Goff's life which has attached him to
the people of his native State was the letter
which he wrote when confined in the dun
geons of Libby prison.
"Judge Goff, then a Union soldier, was
taken a prisoner January 20, 1864, and was
confined for four months in Libby. A rebel
spy named Armsey was likewise captured and
incarcerated within the Federal lines and
condemned to be shot. Goff was held as a
hostage for the spy, and word was sent to the
Federal Government that he would be shot if
Armsey was executed. Goff heard it. and
wrote these lines to President Lincoln: 'If
*uage jyaman iÂ»w Armsey is guilty he should be executed re
gardless of the consequences to me. The life of a single soldier should not stand in the way
of adherence to the great principle.' The letter is on file in the War Office."

THROUGH ALAMO SQUARE.
Grove Street to Be Opened From the
New City Hall to Golden
Gate v Park.
At a meeting of the Hayes-street Im
provement Club Monday!night the question
of opening Alamo square by running Grove
street through' from Steiner to Scott was
fully discussed, but no decisive action was
i taken further than to : instruct the aele
gates to the affiliated clubs to bring tne
matter up at the next meeting.
The Board of Supevisors in 1889 passed
an ordinance authorizing the opening of
this street through the square, on the con
ditions that the property-owners along the
line of Grove street pay for thÃ grading,
sewering and paving out of their own
pockets.
The expenses of this was figured at
about $14,000. Those conditions were ob
jected to on the ground that the pro rata
was unequal and unjust. It would impose
a tax of $1 per foot frontage on all the
property-owners from Larkin to Baker.
The property-owners at either end of the
street objected to this, and as a conse
quence the scheme did not go through.
The conditions of the present proposed
levy are that those on tne further end of the
street should be assessed at 10 cents per
foot, the rate to continue proportionately
toward the center, when the $1 limit
would be reached. In favor of this schedule
it la advanced that the labor and material
are cheaper than they were eight years
ago. Should this project be carried out,
an application will be made to have the
name of Grove street changed to Park
avenue.
It is further claimed that the grade on
this street is less steep than that of Golden
Gate avenue, and as it leads direct from
the City Hall to the park entrance, that it
would make one of the most pleasant
drives in the City in that direction.
The matter will be fully discussed before
the affiliated improvement clubs when the
Hayes Valley delegates get seated in that
body.
The following delegates were elected to
the affiliated clubs: Charles Alpers, J.
Harry Scott and P. J. Gompertx. It was
decided to change the night of meeting
from Monday to the second and fourth
Wednesdays of each month.

Laurel Hall Glub Entertains in Honor
of Its President, Mrs. I.
Lowenberg.
Miss Teen Goodail, daughter of Captain
Goodall, and Hugo Keil were married last
evening at the residence of the Dride, cor
ner of Pierce and McAllister streets. The
wedding was a very quiet affair, only rela
tives and immediate friends being present.
It was a violet wedding. VioletsâPar
ma, Marie Louise and the pure white
blossoms â were used entirely in the deco
rations of the home.
The bride's bouquet was of white violets,
the Marie Lonise variety were carried by
the maici of honor, and quantities of the
modest little blossoms spanned the arch
way of the bay-window, in which the cere
mony was performed, and composed the
snowy white wedding bell that swung
over the heads of the young couple.
Rev. George Walt of Trinity performed
the ceremony.
The bride was attended by Miss Nellie
Boyd, who officiated as maid of honro,
and Ed Keil was best man.
The bridal gown was fashioned of hand
some white brocade and chiffon combined.
The yoKe was ol the latter and the chiffon
formed the corsage. The neck was cut
low and the decolletage outlined with a
bertha of Venetian point. The veil was
fastened to the coiffure with a diamond
crescent, the gift of the groom.
Miss Boyd, the maid of honor, wore a
white brocaded satin gown trimmed with
Brussels net
Mr. and Mrs. Keil left tbis morning for

they will make their home at Belvedere.

evening by the Laurel Hail Club in honor
of its president, Mrs. I. Lowenberg.
The Laurel Hall Club is one of the most
flourishing and popular of the many
literary clubs of this City, and to the
excellent work of the president, Mrs. I.
Lowenberg, it owes much of its success.

follows: Orchestra: greeting, Mrs. Law
don; song, "Erl King," Miss Joseph;

Shareholders Jnost and Butler s nÂ«l on
a Judgment Against a Corporation.
Mrs. Agnea E. Kiernan, by her attor
neys, Delmas & Shortridge, has sued C.
C. Butler, Be bread Joost and Fabian
Joostfor their respective proportions of
debts due to the plaintiff from the San
Francisco and San Mateo Railway Com
pany.
Mrs. Kiernan was injured by an acci
dent on t&e line of the road and instituted
an action for $20,000 damages. The jury
gave her a verdict lor $5000 and judgment
was entered for that amount.
No appeal has been taken by the com
pany, and. one year having elapsed, it is
now unappealable, final and conclusive.
Demands have been made for the money
due from the defendants, and they have
refused to pay. Inasmuch as each de
fendant owned 5000 shares of the capital
stock of the company at the time the
liability was incurred the plaintiff now
asks that they be compelled to pay her
$1250 each, making $3750, and for the bal
ance she will look to the other stock
holders.
A similar suit wan filed by Rudolph
Collink against the Joosts and Butler for
the following sums: Against Butler,
$625; against Behrend Joost, $1125; against
Fabian Joost, $325.

ANOTHER SLEUTH
COME FOR BUTLER
Detective Roche of Sydney
Arrives From Wash
ington.
Chief in Original Searcli and
Then Sought Extradition
Papers.
Fears the Murderer Will Use His
Money to Fight His Case in
Federal Courts.
Another detective has arrived from
Australia and has stationed himself with
the two that for days and days have re
mained constantly at the little harbor po
lice station on Meigsrs wharf, waiting for
the coming of the ship Swanhilda with
Butler, the murder-fiend, aboard.
The new mara is John Hoche, who hns
been connected with the Sydney Detective
Office for the last fifteen years and is re
puted to be one of the best known de
tectives in Australia. He was the chief in
the searcli for Butler in the colonies. It
was principally through his efforts that
several mysterious murders were traced to
a common source; that a pnotograph was
obtained ol the suspected but little known
man whom it was finally learned, had
shipped from Newcastle, N. S. W., on No
vember 23 in the Swaubilda bound for San
Francisco.
Roche arrived in this City yesterday
forenoon direct from Washington. He
was agreeably surprised to find Detectives
McHattie o* Newcastle and Conroy of
Melbourne already here before him. He
had not expected any assistance in taking
the murderer back, for these men had not
left Australia until two days after his de
parture, thoueh they had reached here
very much earlier because of having come
by a more direct route.
According to Roche nine or ten mur
ders are now attributed to Butler, and
there are possibilities of others being dis
covered. As a fake mining expert, luring
men with money to inspect his mythical
mines, Butler conducted a cold-blooded
murdering business in the country from
August 2to November 14. On November
23 he sailed away in the Swanhilda.
It was afterward that his villainy be
came partly known to the police, and
little by little his monstrouscharacter has
been exposed.
Who Butler is, whence he came an I
what are his connections is yet unknown.
Evenhis right name is a mystery, for he
has assumed several names.
Two of Butler's intended victims es

Come Here by Way of London and Washington With
Extradition Papers for Butler, the Murder Fiend.
caped. One was an old mining man
named McAllister. Ho had seen Butler's
advertisement in a Sydney paper and had
arranged to meet him. On the way into
the country be became suspicious, partly
because of the insignificant little coal
scuttle shovel that Butler carrie I and
partly because of Butler's repulsive
countenance, and he deliberately left his
guide and returned to Sydney. Butler
also returned, and it was then that he
registered by another name at the very
hotel he had left a lew hours before.
The other man who escaped Batler's
murderous designs is Conroy himself. He
was not then a detective, but had some
money and had read the advertisement.
When, however, he saw Butler's face be
decided that he would give up the pros
pective investment rather thau enter into
a partnership with such a man. Both
Conroy and Roach describe Butler's face as
one noticeably repulsive, such a face as
can be remembered. His nose is pecul iar.
It is turned slightly to the left and is very
flat on the bridge. Physically Butler is
powerful. He Is about 5 feet 11 inches in
height and weighs 186 pounds, la addi

tion to these physical peculiarities Butler
has a noticeable sailor-lika walk.
It is now kno"rn, says Roche, that
Butler came to Newcastle originally from
Africa as a sailor. About three and a half
years ago he shipped for the west coast of
America and was then called by his ship
mates "Jock," though those that were
acquainted with him at the time and
when he returned do not remember his
name, but know that it was not Butler.
Because of his apparent familiarity with
the place in hla conversational references
to it it is thoueht that Butler hailed Irom
Shropshire, England.
While workina upon the case Roche
found a photograph of Butler taken some
time in September. It was in tbe pos
session of a youn.' woman in Sydney, a
waitress, with whom the murderer had
while taking his meals formed a passing
acquaintance.
From that photograph, cautiously bor
rowed without the eirl knowing it, copies
were made for circulation throughout the
colonies. It was by means of one of these
photographs that Conroy recognized the
murderer as the mining expert.
That Butler is now on board the Swan
hilda, and probably in irons, Roche has
few doubts, as he places reliance in the
Australian press report which stated that
a certain vessel had spoken the Swanhilda
and supplied her with papers criminating
jjutler.
Rociie says that he Hopes to have a
Bpeeial cabin built on deck for the accom
modation of his charge on the homeward
trip. He does not f;incy being compelled
to occupy the steerage on his account.
For some time alter his arrival Roche,
together with McHattie and Conrov, were
with the British Consul. Roche â also
spent a half hour with the Chief of Police.
The question raised by Roche is, W ill
ButJer, who must have considerable
money with him, tight his case here in
the Federal courts and resist being re
leased to the Australian representatives?
Ab soon as be shall have arrived and been
captured the detectives will be given a
hearing to prove their claim upon him.
Then if the Federal Judge thinks that the
facts warrant it be will permit the captive
to be held for transportation.
The result of the inquiry will be tele
graphed to Washington and the extra
dition permit will be telegraphed back.

WHEAT SHIPS ARE
LOADING LUMBER
The Anglesey Has Been
Added to the Engaged
List.
She Will Take Her Cargo in
the Bay and Thus Save
Dockage.
D G. Camarinos Has Gone to Hono
lulu to Start a N?w Com
pany.
The British ship Anglesey was towed
down from Selby's by the tug Fearless
yesterday. She is the first of the disen
gaged fleet to come out of retirement, aad
will load redwood lumber for England.
All her ballast was put in at Selby's, and
the vessel will not have to dock again in
this port. Her cargo will de brought down
in .the coasting fleet and put aboard in the
stream, thus saving dockage and towage
expenses. Of the engaged fleet in port, 17
vessels are loading wheat, 5 are loading
lumber, one is going to Newcastle in bal
last to load coal for this port, one in going
to Honolulu to load sugar for New York
and another is going to Paget Sound to
load lumber for Australia. All of them
that can are saving expenses by taking in
ballast or loading in the stream, and in
consequence the balarfce sheet of the Har
bor Commissioners will not show up very
well at the end of the month.
The Anglesey is> anchored off the Fol
som-street pier, and the work of loading
her will begin to-morrow.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia sailed for Honolulu yesterday, with
one of the largest cargoes she has taKen
away for months. Among the passengers
were D. G. Camnrinos, the ex-Greek Con
sul and J. Travis, late of the Chronicle.
Mr. Travis goes to Hawaii to take a posi
tion on the Hawaiian Star, while Mr.
Camarinos goes to incorporate the Ameri
can and Hawaiian Commercial Company.
The concern will operate near Hilo, ana
its object is to cultivate all kinds of tropi
cal lrults and vegetables, besides aspara
gus, green corn, string beans, and among
the fruits will be grapes, peaches, cherries
and strawberries. These will all be landed
here in midwinter, when the market is
bare and in return California products
will be shipped to the islands. If ail goes
â¢yell with the project two steamers â one
of 1200 tons and tne other of 1500 tons
will be built. These will have refriger
ating chambers and beef and mutton will
help to swell out the return loads to Hono
lulu. Camarinos is confident that his
scheme will go through, and expects to
have an opposition line of steamers on the
route inside of a year.
The tugboat Lena B was in trouble
early yesterday morning, and not only
lost" her smokestack but was otherwise
damaged. The steamer Willamette had
a breast line out to Main-street wharf,
while Bhe was lying alongside the City of
Puebla at Beale street. In the early
morning along come the Lena B and the
steel hawser just missed the pilot but
caught the smokestack, and carried away
everything aft of it. The captain of the
tug asserts that be will have damages out
of the Willamette for having a breast line
out, or else he will libei the steamer.
George Dryden, wharfinger at Main
street wharf, had a narrow escape yester
day. Two longshoremen were having a
quarrel, and one of them went for the
other with a hatchet. Dryden ran in to
Btop the fray and received a blow on the
hand that nearly cut off one of his fingera,
He at once went to St. Mary's Hospital,
where the wound was dressed. Wben the
longshoreman saw what he had done he
at once made his escape and has not been
seen since. .
Another party of hunters sailed in a
small boat on a whale hunt yesterday.
They intend it successful to bring the
mammal to Mission-, treet wharf and
their exhibit it. The captain of the crew
applied to the Chief Wharfinger for space
yesterday and the iatter, acting under in
structions from the president of the board,
said he was entitled to space so long as no
nuisance was created.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's

with canned goods, and yesterday the
State of CaU'ornia went alongside and

of the bleakest on the water-front, and in
consequence Captain Carey and Chief En
gineer McKaiK are down witn bronchitis,
while Purser Bendel and half a dozen
other members of the crew are suffering
from severe colds.
Mate E. G. Sorgatz of the ship Hawaiian
Isles denies that he ever knew Butler or
ever paid him $5 in order to save trouble.
The statement was made that Butler ap
plied to Captain Kustel, stating that he
haa been sent on by the ship's agents in
Sydney. Ln the meantime Sorgatz had
been engaged, and so the captain in
formed the so-oalled murderer. In order
that Butler should not be out of pocket,
The Call stated, Sorgatz paid him the
money. This the mate denies. All the
rest of the story is vouched for by Captain
Kustel.
The Harbor Commissioners had a
lengthy session. The petition of 700
workingmen who have to cross the
Fourth-street bridge mornine and even
ing in order to reach the Union Iron
Works, the rolling mills and BUgar re
finery, asking that the draw be closed be
tween the hours of 5:30 and 6:30 a. m. and
6:30 and 7:30 p.m., was laid on the table.
The men pointed out that a detention of
ten minutes at these hours meant the loss
of an hour's work. The Commissioners,
however, looked at the other side, and
President Colnon remarked that the loss
of an hour to a vessel meant the loss of a
tide and twelve hours of idleness for the
captain and crew.
The dredger Empire was offered to the
commission, but Chief Engineer Hoime3
and Superintendent of Tuga and Dredgers
Brown decided that she was too large for
the work, so the offer'was rejected. A
new dredger will be built
The new Postoffice in the ferry depot
was discussed, and President Colnon re
marked that the alterations necessary
would costssooo at least. "They want an
elevator, a steel vault for registered pack
ages and many other improvements," said
he. *'VVhen the ferry depot was designed
we nev-r figured on a postoffice such as
they ask for, but since the railway mail
service has been extended to the streetcar
line? extra facilities are necessary. We
have just $000,000 with which to put up
the building, and if we cannot make these
necessary alterations without overrunning
that amount we will have to ask the
Board of General Appraisers to allow us
to charge the extra cost to the harbor
improvement fund."
All the members of the board were in
favor of making the alterations askea for
by Postmaster McCoppin, and they will
be carried out.

was crowded to the doors, and the floral
offerings were unusually beautiful. The

RAILWAY SERVICE
MEN WILL MEET
Hundreds of Uncle Sam's
Postal Employes Ccming
to This City.
Their Twenty-Second National
Convention Convenes Here
in February.
Delegates of Their B nevolent Order
Will Come From All Parts of
the United States.
The twenty-second National convention
of the Railway Mail Service Benevolent
Association will be held in this City dur
ing the week of March 15.
The holding of a convention in San
Francisco has been a project long cher
i*hsd by the clerks in thiÃ division of the
service, but the great distance to be
traversed by the delegates from the East
ern States has until this year been an in
surmountable obstacle. Two years ago
the Southern Pacific Company made a
Prominent Local Members of the Railway Mail Service Benevolent Association, Shortly to
Convene in This CityÂ»
very generous proposal to the clerks, and,
using this as a basis of wortc, Superinten
dent Flint and his secretary, W. C. Ham- j
mond, succeeded in making such arrange- {
ments with other transportation com
paniealn the Western States as to render
the undertaking feasible, and at the Chi
cago, convention in 1895 this City was
selected for the meeting of 1867. For over
a year, therefore, preparations for this
convention have been made by the officers
and c.erks of the postal service in this City
and throughout the Pacific division of
the railway mail service. As their ar
rangements are nearing completion and
the day approaches they are looking for
ward to the arrival of their co-workers
from the Eastern States with many happy
anticipations.
The association, which this gathering
will represent, is an old and
benevolent order, whose membership is
composed of rail way postal c;erks, postoffice
inspectors and department officials who
*upervisr> the transportation of the mails.
It was founded twenty-seven years ago by
a few route agents who desired to provide
for the families of their comrades killed
in the service, and, at the same time, es
cape the exorbitant premiums demanded
by insurance companies.
It met with much opposition and no
favor during the first years of its existence,
largely because its promoters were with
out financial training, and its scant mem
bership was scattered over a large scope of
territory. Finally, however, by the favor
of a department ofliciul, a convention was
held at Chicago, which excited some en
thusirsm ano gave courage toils sponsors.
The membership soon afterward showed
an appreciable growth, department and
division officials applied for admission
and the prestige of tne society seemed es
tablished. In an evil hour, however, a
treasurer was elected, who signalized hi?
administration by absconding with the
entire assets, which, through loose busi
ness methods, were at the time unsecured.
Thus deprived of everything but its
name, thÂ»> association began another up
hih struggle with only 140 members. By
levying double and treble assessments on
the remnaut of its membership who were
willing to ptnnd this sort of financiering
it established a small reserve fund. It
was then incorporated under the laws ot
Illinois and its certificates written to
cover deaths from any cause. It has since
experienced a steady growth and has at
this time 3760 members who are each in
sured in the sum of $2000. It has but one
salaried officer, who receives tne pay of
his grade in the Railway Mail Service.
By keeping the expenses of administra
tion at a minimum it affords to its mem
bers the cheapest insurance known.
The National convention is an old cus
tom of the clerks. At first only business
meetings were held ns circumstances de
manded, but for many years these have
been merged into one general gathering
and the business routine supplemented by
social features in which the families of
the delegates participate. It has thus
come to be the annual holiday affair of
the Railway Mail Service, to which every
clerk looks forward with keen interest.
These annual meetings, by affording the
rank and file of the service an opportunity
to exchange ideas and compare methods,
have been beneficial to the service, and
the dei>artment has always encouraged
them by arranging transportation for the
delegates and their tamilies.
In recognition of the hazardous work
and valuable service performed by the
railwayman clerks the cities in which
their conventions have beÂ«Â»n held hereto
fore have made special rfforts to provide
suitable entertainment for tire visiting
delegates. .
The assistance given by the citizens 01
.San Francisco, so far, toward the eiuer
tainmentof these visitors indicates t;<at
there will be no cause for complaint
asiainst tho hospitality of the Western
metropolis-
The dele;;at o s and their wive*, number
ing in all about 300, will leave Chicago in
â  special train over t!Â»e Burlington route
anfi will reach San Francisco via Billings
(Mont.), Spokane and Portland, stopping
one day in the last-named city-
They will arrive in Ban Francisco March
15, remaining hire tire days; thence to Los
Angeles, where they will remain twodays,
and take up the homeward journey via
the Santa Fe route. The special train,
consisting of eight Pullmans, will be pi
loted over the greater part of its lons jour
ney by Captain L. L. Troy, superintendent
of the Chicago division of the railway. mail
service. When it p.vse* into toe Pacific
division at Spokane. Wash., it will be mef
by Superintendent Fiint. who will be the
â¢olci man', until it leaves his territory
again at Albuquerque, N. M. The enter
tainment in this City will be a
bay excursion, a trip to Monterey
ana the Santa Cruz big trees, a
day at the Cliff House and Golden
Gate Park and an excursion to liaywards.
The evening entertainment will consist of
a banquet, theater party Hnd a tour ot the
Chinese quarter. At Sacramento the dele
gates will partake of a breakfast provided
by the cimeu-j of that ciiy, after which
they will be escorted to the Capitol build
ing and received by Governor Bndd. At
Los An^-eies a trip will be arranged either
to Mount Lowe or Catulina Island. For
the purposes of this entertainment the
railway postal clerks of San Francisco.
Lo? Angeles and Oirden have subscnbsi
$2000 and additional amounts have been
received from citizens of San Francisco
and the postmasters at neighboring cities.
In order to increase thi* entertainment
fund PostofSce Inspector Erwin has con-
sented to deliver a lecture on the postal
servic at Y. M. C. A. Hall on February 4.
This lecture will explain in detail the
functions and opera. ions of the United
States postal system, and will be illus- I
trated with stereopticon views. Mr. Erwin
has been collecting data for this lecture for
several years, and his long connection with
the department as one of the confidential
agents of the Postmaster-General renders
him peculiarly tit to speak on this subject
This lecture wa< arranged by the postal
clerks, thinking that its instructive
features wouid prove especially interesting
to the business community, which de
pends so largely on the mails in the con
duct of daily affairs.
In the arrangements for this National
convention the Postoffice officials at
Washington and the superintendents of
Eastern divisions have taken the liveliest
interest.
The arrangements for the reception and I
entertainment of the visitors in San Fran- j
Cisco have been in charge of Assistant
Superintendent Lewis, Uie executive of
ficer for the association for the Pacific
division; Superintendent Flint; the di
vision 01 Pos-toffice inspectors; T. T. Ford, !
superintendent of mails, and the follow- \

EESULT 01 A RAID-
Private Detective C'allundan Fined \
SUM) for Malicious Mischief.
T. H. Callundan, a priva'.e detective, was ,
fined $100 or 100 days in the County Jail
by Juure Joachirasen yesterday, on tiie
charge of malicious mischief. His attor- i
nev, W. H. Cook, gave notice oi appeal.
Callundan was arrested on October 16
on a warrant sworn out by Lee Hen. Four j
days previous Cailundan, acting tinder the j
instructions of the Chinese Consul, raided j
thÂ« clubrooms of the See Yup society in
Chinatown and destroyed, it was alleged,
about $5000 worth of property.
When the case was tried it was urged
that, as Callundan had acted under in
structions of the Consul, there was no
malice on his part, but the Judge took a
different view of the case.
The Callundan raid was one of the moves
in the Sam Yup-See Yup warfare that re
sulted in the assassination of "Little
Pete."

MRS. QUACKENBUSH
VISIBLY TREMBLED
Attorney Foote's Pointed
Questions Affected Her
Nerves.
Nevertheless She Held Her
Ground in Regard to Her
Marriage.
Gas Bills and Grocery Accounts That
Caused Acrimonious Dis
cussion.
Mrs. Nancy Ann Abbott Quackenbush
had another interesting interview witb
Attorney W. \V. Foote in Judge Seawell's
yesterday.
incidentally her attorney presented on
her behalf quite a number of documents to
sustain her claims to wifebood.
For instance, there were about a dozen
gas receipts for the house occupied by
Mrs. Quackenbush, all of said receipts
being made out in the name of T. M.
Quackenbush, who is claimed by her as
her husband by contract, although he
denies it.
Against this batch ol documents Mr.
Foote directed an energetic attack.
Mrs. Quackenbush testified that in order
ing provisions and supplies she made out
a list of what was wanted and Quscken
bush signed it. Then it was sent to the
dealer. lie always gave Mrs. Abbott a
part of the money necessary to pay the
rent. Stie produced a receipt bearing the
signature of a woman now dead for rent
once paid by Quackenbush. She also had
a package of receipts from the San Fran
cisco Gaslight Company made out to
Quackenbusb.
She produced some private notes writ
ten to her by Quackenbush. They were
almost ai illegible as Chinese lottery tick
ets. Attorney Foote insisted that the
court shou d read them and then pass on
tLeir legiblity. Judge Seawell could not
read them, and Attorney fiodgers started
to decipher them from a translation.
Foote objected to the translation, and
Mrs. Abbott was asked to read them.
The lady made an effort, but it was im-
possible for her to give the fall signifi
cance of the scrawls.
The jimduction of tbÂ« grocery bills
aroused Mr. Foote'a ire. He wanted to
j know if all the bills lor groceries bad been
kept by her, and she said that she retained
all th:>l came into her hands.
"Don't you know that there were
grocery bills made out in your name that
were receipted and that you destroyed
tnem?" thundered Mr. Fooie.
"That is not true," replied the witness
in fear and trembling.
"Did you not buy groceries at Chiff's
and Sbnrboro's in your own name?" was
the next question.
"Not that I know of," replied the wit
ness.
A rpoeipt for rent for the premises at
1001 Washington street, signed by D. L.
Fonts and dated January 2, 1893, was pro
vocative of much discus-ion. It read:

to Mr. Quackenbush?
Tne \wtness â He asked me to take care of
them?
Why do you call this receipt "them?"
I mean all the receipts.
Don't you know that he was exceedingly

Yes.

Yesâ rather.

Yes.
Didn't he take a receipt for every nickel that

Mr. Foote's inference in his subsequent
questions wa> that Mrs. Quackenbusb had
taken possession of the papers belonging
to Quackenbush for the purpose of bolster
ing up ncr claim.
The note signed "yours lovingly, T. M.
Q.," was especially objected to by Mr.
Foote. He asked "the witness if she did
not write the "lovingly" in after she re
ceived it from Quackenbush, and she de
nied the insinuation. She also resented
any imputation that ehf has fabricated
any papers for use in thi9 suit for $300 a
month alimony.
Mrs. Eva Poindexter and Mrs. Delia
Heerness testified that they heard Mr.
Quackenbush and Mrs. Abbott, as she was
then known, talk of their engagement to
be married and of their intention to go
East on a bridal tour.
On cross-examination Mrs. Poindexter
confessed to Mr. Foote that she abandoned
her children in the Eist before coming to
Caliiornia. She said she obtained a divorce
from her husband, but tne records of the
court were produced, showing that her
busband obtained a divorce from her.
SCHOOL DEFICIT LARGER.
Director Waller Discover* That the
. ... Amount Exceed* His Original
â  . â  â  Estimate. ,
- The meeting of the Board of Education
this evening will be a very lively affair in
all probability. H The deficiency in the
finances of the School Department is,
according to the figures secured yesterday
by School Director Waller, larger than
was at first supposed when it was placed
at $90,000. Yesterday Mr. Waller an
nounced that the deficit at the end of the
fiscal year will be nearer $120,000 than any
other figure.
Books and accounts have been carefully
considered during the past few days by
Mr. Waller, and he has also worked inde
fatigably to ascertain facts from all
sources, that the situation may be fully
understood. Auditor Broderick and the
Tax Collector have supplied some data.
The result of all this is that Mr. Waller
will have a statement, type-written, to
present this evening for the consideration
of his fellow -members in the board, and
the statement will be madeâ ''There is the
defict," this being followed closely by the
question â "What are you going to do
about it?"
"We hope by economy," said Waller
yesterday, "to diminish me amount of
the deficiency some before the end of the
fiscal year. We will get $10,000 less from
the apportionment 01 the Supervisors of
the City taxes than we figured on. There
is also another deficit due in the second
installment of the State taxes, which in
stalment ought to have amounted to $217,
--000, but it will fall down to $197,000.
The Supervisors figured too closely.
If Auditor Broderick's figures had been
taken in making the apportionment we
would have been in much better shape."
Yesterday the representative of the
Miriam Company of Boston, who fur
nished a stock of dictionaries to the
School Department, called upon Mr. Wal
ler to see what could be done in the direc
tion of getting paid for them. He said
that be did not want the dictionaries back,
but wanted the money for those delivered,
amounting to $<J4S. The purchase was
clearly in violation of the one twelfth act
and Mr. Waller has been so advised by
Auditor Broderick. j The agent went away
and probably will be heard from later. .
MARKET-STREET MASHER
A Tonne; Lady Testifies Against Joseph
Bush, Who nls Convicted of
Vagrancy.
Joseph BuÂ«h and S. M. Stone, the
Market-street mas tiers, appeared in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday to answer the
charge of vagrancy.
Detective Graham and Policeman Mr-
Gee testified that the two young men had
been hanging around the Emporium for
some weeks and complaints had been
made to them that ladles had been in
sulted by the mashers.
Carrie Epstein, a young lady living at
3523 Twenty-third street, -testified that
Bush had accosted her on Market street
last Wednesday. He asked to escort her
home, and she felt indignant and told
him she did not know him. She walked
away, but he followed her up Powell street
and again spoke to her. She walked as
far as O'Farrell street, Bush still following
her, and as sho turned along O'FarrÂ»Â»ll she
met Policeman McGee. She told McGee
that Bush had insulted her and McGee
placed him under arrest.
Bush eland that he had no intention
of insulting the young lady, said he was a
married man and a plumber by trade.
The Judge convicted him of vagrancy and
ordered him to appear for sentence to-day.
The case against Stone, whose chief fault
appears to De that he was a. companion of
Bash, was continued till to-day.

Two unfortunate men trusted their Jives
to .a frail scaffolding yesterday morning,
and now one is dead ami the other's life is
flickering, ready to go out.
Both were married men, with children
depending upon the earnings of their toil.

avenue, while J. Buckley, who is so bruised
and injured that there is faint chance of
his recoverinc. has a wife and a couple of
babies at 1307 Broadway, Alameda.
Walter U.ake, the contractor, and a
brother of the- man who died immediately
after the fall, is a house-painter, whose
office is on California street, near Kearny.
He instructed William Blake anc" Buckley
to take their paraphernalia to the build
ing of Poy Kee & Co., shoe manufacturers
at 51 Stevenson street, and prepare the
three-story building for painting.
The iren arrived there early, and about
10 o'clock they had the scaffolding hang
ing. The ladder, at either end of which
the guy ropes from above were attached,
was a frail affair rvhich had been in use
for years. On it lay a thin plank, and
botb.of these were incapable of holding the
weight of one man, let alone that of two
and the paint Dots.
They broke squarely in two as soon as
thu painters got aboard, pnd down crashed
the .poor fellows to the stone pavement
fifty feet below.
Blake struck on Ins bead, leaving a gory
mark where he fell. This injury caused
his death. Buckley broke his right arm

THE KENNEL CLUB GONE.
The Olympic Gun Club Will Step Into
the Shoes of the Defunct
Pacilios.
A special meeting of the Pacific Kennel
Club vas held last evening in the Occi
dental Hotel to hear the report of a com
mittee recently appointed to interview
members relative to the policy of the club
in the future.
E. Briggs, who was chairman of the
committee, reported that of twenty-eight
members who were interviewed all were
in favor of the ;lub disuanding. Mr.
Bushnell then moved that the money and
property of the Pacific Kennel Club be
given to the Olympic Gun Club as a
guarantee fund, provided that it will give
a bench show this year in this City,
and in the event of the Olympic Gun
Club failing to hold a show this year the
money of the Pacific Kennel Club placed
in its charge revert to a committee ap
pointed by the chair, or in theevent of the
Olympic Gun Club holding a successful
show without the necessity of having to
call upon the funds of the Pacific Kennel
Club, said fining must be refunded to the
committee to be equally divided among
the Protestant, Catholic and Hebrew or
phan asylums of this City.
The motion was carried unanimously
and the chair appointed Messrs. Watson,
Uruenhagen, Briggs, Bushnell and Haight
as the committee.
E. Briggs moved that owing to the fact
that the hazardous duties of the club have
tor years failen upunthe shoulders of a
few enthusiastic members, and because of
, the lack of interest and support iuani-
fested by its representatives, the club
disband and that its secretary duly notify
the American Kennel Club of its action
and tender the Olympic Gun Club its
hearty support in the event of a show be
ing held under its auspices. This motion
was also carried unanimously. The mem
bers present tendered a vote of thanks to
the officers of the club for their untiring
efforts to further the interest of the club
during their term of service. The Olympic
Gun Club will meet this evening to hear
the report of the committee, and as it
will doubtless be favorable to- the Gun
Club it is safe to iay that a bench show
will be held this year.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1897.
DAVID WAS FIRST
AT LONG ODDS
The Ring Laid 30 to 1
Against the Meek-
Looking Chestnut.
All Six of the Favorites Met
With Defeat at Ingleside
Yesterday.
The Sinner Was First at Odds cf
30 to Iâ McLight NosÂ»d Out
Cabrillo in the Mile Rui.
There was a mild growl among a few
turf patrons on Monday at the frequency
with which short-priced horses in the
betting caught the eye of the judges first
at the local track. Yesterday long-shots
rolied over The line in such profusion that
it is probable the voices of these grumblers
are hushed torever. The star of all these
rank outsiders was the plebeian-looking
chestnut David. The son of Wawekus
arrived here recently from New Orleans,
and one day last week started in a seven
and a half iurlong dash at Oakland, finish
ing a eooa third to Yankee Doodle and
Mt. McGregor 11. Notwith^tandine this
fine showing the ring laid 30 to 1 against
him. The race sras third on the card, a
six and a half furlong spin, and David was
meeting such good ones as Ferrier, Liber
tine, California, Zainar and Geyser.
Ferrier, carrying 110 pounds, was the
post favorite at odds of 9 to 5, with Liber
tine a liberally backed second choice.
Zamar II made the running and was first
lnlo the stretch by a length, followed by
Libertine and Geyser. Below the furlong
pole T. McHugh on David moved up from
next to last position, passed both Zamar
and Libertine and taking the rail
position won handily by a couple of
lengths, and incidentally set the track
record for the distance at 1 :21%.. In a
hard drive Libertine beat Dan Bonig's
sprinter a head for the place. Both the
favorite, Ferrier, and California suffered
interlerence during the progress of the
race.
This was not the only startling surprise
of the day. In the last race of the day
The Siuner, with 30 to 1 about bim,
downed Gene Leigh's fast celt Good Times
and others, and old McLigbt headed
out his company in the mile at a happy
f'gure in the betting. Tom Griffin's mare
Addie Buchanan lowered the colors of
the cinchy favorite, Applause, and three
others siartine in the fifth event, and alto
gether it was a most disastrous day for the
first choices. The desire of those looking
for spice and variety must certainly have
been satiated.
The first race decided, a six furlong, sell
ing affair, with light welter weight up,
saw the 6 to 1 outsider, Masoreo, cleverly
ridden by Charley Thorpe, finish first half
a length ahead of the 2 to 1 choice, Neb
ula, piloted by Jones. The Corrigan en
try, Jezebel, was third.
Eleven members of the kindergarten
divis on face J the barrier in the three fur
long scramble. Carrying 118 pounds, Duke
of York II was backed down from 5 to 2
to 6 to 5, and although putting up a most
creditable race, was outfooted and beaten
half a length by the Ezell entry, On Gua
Nitn,with lOSDonnd* in the saddle. Count
of Fanders was once again third. The
winner wa-10 to 1 in the betting.
The mile run that followed was prolific
of another upset. With Sloan up, Cabrillo
carrying 104 pounds, was a supposed "lead
pipe," but in a run home from the head of
stretch was outpaced by McLigbt and
nosed out at the wire in 1:41%. Olive came
very fast at the finish, ending up a close
third. The winning nor c was ridden to
good advantage by "Skeets" Martin, after
getting away from the post last of the field.
Although on paper the fifth event at a
mile looked a good thing for Purser's mare
Applause, which was held a 1 to 2 chance
in a majority of .the books, the knowing
money went in on Addie Buchanan, forc

Doggett raced the favorite's bead off the
first six furlongs and when challenged by
Addie Buchanan in the stretch had noth

The Beautiful Creation of the Silversmiths* Art to Be Presented to
the Owner of the Horse Winning the v Spreckels Cup,"
One of the Classic Events of the California Turf, Down
for Decision in the Near Future at the Ingleside Track.
I:42>Â£. Treachery caught the tiring
favorite the last few strides, getting the
place by a nose.
The Sinner will be held in much
greater respect when next he appears.
He wa9 allowed to grope back in the
betting on the final six-furlong sprint, de
cided under selling conditions, until 30 to
1 was obtainable, the supposit on being
that 121 pounds was more than he could
handle. Hennessy took him out in front
from the start and, never headed, passed
the judges over two lengths clear of
Basquil and the 9 to 10 choice, Good
Times, which pair fought it out for the
place, resulting in a victory for the former
colt.
LADIES' DAY AT INGLESIDE
Seyen Well-Filled Events at One
Mile or Over Down for
Decision.
Some cf the Best H rses in Training
at the Track W.!l Faca the
Barrierâ N.tes.
This is "ladies' day" at Ingleside track,
and seldom has a racing organization fur
nished its patrons with a programme of
such rare excellence. Every race down
for decision is at a mile or over, and the
lovers of long-distance spsrt will be in
their element. AH of the best horses in
training quartered on the track are en
tered, and the novelty ot seven distance
events being decided in one afternoon
promises to attract one of tne biggest
crowds of the season. Among the entries
are Pat Dunne's grand horse Captive;
David, the sensational winner of yester
day; Semper Lex, and other cracKS. Spe
cial cars will be run for the accommoda
tion of racegoers over the electric line on
Mission street.
President A. B. Spreckels of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club announced yesterday
that the four-mile race originally set for
decision on Fehruary 22 would not be run
on that date. 1 his date was claimed by
the Ingleside association some time ago
for the . running of this particular race,
but on last week the California Jockey
Club announced that the four-mile stake
on that club's programme would be run
on February 20. This would, of course,
preclude the horses running in ' this
latter race starting again two days later.
Yielding to ihe wishes of horsemen with
an eye to capturing one or the other of
these distance runs, Mr. Spreckels said
that his club would postpone the running
of its stake until later in the season, an
other stake being substituted as the fea
ture of the Washington's birthday card;
David won a number of handicaps dur
the past summer. He was well nigh un
beatable at Milwaukee, so a prominent
trainer states, showing himself a horse
capable of reeling off a mile in l; 40.
Sam Doggett must be a very poor judge
of pace. He rushed Applause away as
thou h the distance* to be covered was
three panels instead of la mile and the
mare's defeat was predicted before half
tb* distance had been run.
Morrellito is the first of the get of the
dead Morello to lace the* barrier. He did
not accomplish wonder?, but may improve
with a little more age.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman placed $100
about the ring on David, getting 25 to 1
for his money. He bought soda water for
everybody in proximity to his stand when
that horse won.
Olive ran a corking good race yesterday
and is evidently rounding to again to her
old form. â¢â¢â â¢â¢â .._ - - â

known local firms, as follows: Four
against 8. Glaser, three against the Abner
Doble Company, one against Bowen &
Schrarn, one against Goslinsky & Co. ana

Hangs Upon a Hat.
The preliminary examination of John Dra
back on the charge of burglary was com
menced yesterday afternoon before Judge
Campbell. Draback was accused of breaking
into the store of Antone Drankley, Thirtieth
and Mission streets, last Friday night. Con
siderable evidence was taken, and the whole
thins appears to hinge on whether a hat iound
in the store belonged to Draback. He was
told to put it op in court, but it did not fit
him. The case was continued.

Death NoW Comes Suddenly tO
â¢ : m-
Mrs. Thomas J. Shack
â 
leiOrd*
Just Three Weeks Ago tin Heal of
tbe House, Too, Expired of
Heart Dis a,e
ââ
Like her husband, who went recently
before, death came suddenly but easily to
Mrs. Elizabeth P. Shackleford. It was
heart disease, according to the doctors, in
both cases. â¢
Just three weeks ago Attorney Thomas
J. Shackleford took a seat in a train at
Visalia en route to his home at 1006 Leav
en worth street in this City. When the
conductor asked the passenger for his
ticket death paid the fare. The end had
come /the jogging of cars. So it
was with the widow he left behind. ['
At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
string snapped and there passed from the
Southern element of San Francisco society
one of its most popular members.
Mrs. Shackleford was a Miss Hunter, a
native of Lexington, Mo., in 1848. .Her
late husband was a Southerner from
_ -â¢".. .-i_.' - . ;â  -â  - â¢ ., -â¢â , -,- . â 
Lynchburg, Va., and the turmoils of the
Civil War sent both families West in the
early '60s. Shackleford settled in Visalia.
So did Miss Hunter and her people. ;
Just twenty-eight years ago they were
married. The husband had political am
bition end gratified them in his younger
days.' He was secretary of the State Sen
ate in 1868 and representative in the As
sembly from Tulare County a year later.
Later he drifted to San Francisco, and
was at once admitted to the inner circle of
"chivalry" element of the Southern
Democrats. He' was appointed secretary â 
of the Board of Health and later cashier
of the Custom-house, under Collector John
S. Hager. Throughout he was a good
citizen. -â â .-:>-; V
The funeral' has been set for 2 o'clock
to-morrow. The:ob?eqnies will be held in
'he family residence and the interment at
Masonic Cemetery.

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and ram*.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in tha interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is. inclosed with isobars of

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer

NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 2b\-The transactions

were confined to room-traders and were entirely
devoid of significance, save perhaps in the way of
indicating a disposition of outstanding noldero.
'1 he tendency was upward in the very start except
for occasional rains by the bears, having but little
effect. Coalers were strengthened by denials of
some of the sensational reports recently current
concerning the affairs of the Delaware and Hud

This raid tailed to Influence the market in the
slightest degree, and toward the close there was
an advance all along the line. The demand to

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 26.â Wheat broke sharply j
to-day, despite the bullish construed Government j
report. For some time the trade hits based
operations on the cry that the Government would
report a yield from 425,000,000 to 450,000,000
bushels for 1896. The lisures yesterday placing
the crop at 427,000.000 bushels should have, ac
cording to all ru:esoi cons stency, caused prices to
advance, but. on the contrary, m is usually the
case in speculation, the unexpected hapi.eued and |
prices slumped with rapidity. Liverpool rabies i
quoted a loss of from Vis J to S-irl' tUus display- |
ing unconcern a;, the om\;a report of the Ameri- j
can crop. From the opening there were li avy i
offerings, and no demand except from "put '
holders.
Receipts were 45 cars and 81.663 bushel* were
taken from store. The Northwest had 125 cars
against 268 last i uesday and 406 on the corre
sponding day a week ago. Bi adstreet's reported a i
decrease In the world's sto ksof 1,137.000 bush
els, which was a bull disappointment. Closing
Tans and Berlin cables were lower. Antwerp was
unchanged. Kxport clearances amounted to 316,
--384 bushels. May wh- a- opened from 79Vic and

S7S 8 .-,
CORNâ Weakness was prominent in corn as
well as wheat on account of the sympathy exist
ing between the two grains. 'lhe Government
statement showed that the crop of 18^6 was
fully as great as every one expected. The esti
matÂ« was given as -.'J83.000.0U0 bushels, some
thing enormous. Prices sold off. but not as
sharply as those of wneat. HecÂ«:pts were 453
cars and 70.000 bushels were withdrawn from
store. Liverpool cables quoted i*! decline. Brad
street's reported an increase of Â±uÂ«,000 bu-hels tn
mocks. Exports were light at. 134.042 bushels.
May corn opened at 2hS.Â±(a23?.gc, dec ined to "JS-Vs

Estimated receipts for io-morio>v 210 cars.
OATsâ Everything else being in a sate of col
lapse there was no reason why oats should not be
in line. The air of weaknesspsrvading the other
pits existed here. The Government estimated
last year's yield at 707,000.000 bushels. Receipts
were 318 cars and 24,055 bushels were withoiawn
from store export clearances were 12,662 bush

UNION STOCKYARDS, 111.. Jan. 26.-The
supply of ca tie on sale to-day was, as usual on
Tuesday, smallâ only 3000 head.
The day being cold buyers were reluctant to
spend much tiui-Â» in the yaids. ' A dull steady
market was therefore noted. Most of the cattle
were ordinary in quality. Feeders have teen too
saving of their corn, and fewer fat cattle are being
sent to market than In other season i when feed
was worth double the amount. The co weather
is hard on hogs In transit, and a good many have
reached here in a halt- frozen condition. Only
18,000 arrived to-day, against 37. 174 last Tuesday.
Eastern shippers took one-fourth of the offerings
yesterday. Shippers were light purchasers this
morning, but with the small prices supply prices
were sustained. During the latter part of the day i
prices weakened, and closed be lower nan yps.er
day's top figures, sheep and lambs were weak,
the supply being liberal and demand poor. Prices

A Kentucky Humorist.
The late W. A. Conchman of Ciark
County, Ky., was the perpetrator of an
extraordinary practical joke. Returning
from a hunting trip one evening he was
attracted to a country church wnere a re
vival was in progress. After watching
tiie services for awhiie he climbed up on
the roof to get a better view through the
hole wnere a stove-pipe was meant to co.
In the excitement of the evening one of
the congregation shouted out: "Gabriel,
blow your horn! I'm ready to so!" The
temptation was foo great for â¢Conchman
and, putting his horn to his lips, he blew
a blast through the flue- hole, and stam
peded the congregation to a man. Tne
Grand Jury discussed the propriety of in
dicting the sacrilegious hunter, but no
proce- dings were laKen against him.

W. R. Davis Speaks of the
New Electric Road
Across Town.
Prominent Capitalists Assert
That They Are Acting
in Good Faith.
Broadway Wi! 1 No Longer Be the
Deadline Street of Passen
ger Travel.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
008 Broadway. Jan. 26. J
4- franchise has been asked of the City j
Council /or a new electric road to run )
across, town, and tbero is much specula
tion concerning its promoters and the ul
timate object of 'iesiring the franchise.
The route proposed is as follows: Com
mencing at Fallon and Sixth streets,
along Sixth to Oak, along OajÂ£ to Ninth,
thence along Ninth to Market, along
| fc'ot to' Tenth, thence io Center, then
/ Twelfth, along Twelflh to Peralta,
' cc to Lincoin and out westerly to the
city boundary.
Ex-Mayor W. R. Davie, who seems to
know more about the franchise than any
else, said to-day that the franchise
'..;>- ! oen asked for in good faith.
"Waeiherit pay or not," he said, "is of
little* consequence to the public, if mon
eyed men are. willing to take the chances.
It has been suggested that the roate is
beiiig sought for the purpose of a steam
rOavl' to connect with some railroad, but
tills is nonsense because the law pro
vides that a Council mny grant a frsn
chise to an electric road, but that two
thirds' of the pro] erty-owners alone the
street must give their consent for 8 right
of way for a steam line. Tho.-e who be
lieve that the promoters are not in earnest
will rind their errer in due time."
The franchise was tough: by J. J.
Lamping, and i; :s learned that he repre
sents Frederick Delger and other cap
i; a lists.
For a long time rcuch complaint has
been made that Bror.dway has been a dead
line to ttavei irom cither East or West
Oakland. Ayearaeo passengers coming
in ironi either end of the city could trans
fer across Broadway and be taken to the
other end of the city. But at the time
staied a compact was entered into by
whicn no transfers were granted across
Broadway, except those that went out to
Fiedmom. This system has worked a
great hardship on resio.ents of either end
oi the city who wish to cross Broaaway,
and- for ' a long time they have sought
a means to break up the existing agree
ment. It is true that a trip from Iruit
vale to West Oakiaud coud be made on
the Seventh-street local for one nickel, but
a very small percentage of the population
lives in the neghborhoud of the Feventh
street local, and as a street passenger ser
vice it has never been patronized beyond
a very limited extent.
The route of the proposed road will
(ik up the agreement not to transfer
n Broadway, oecause the existing law
bits' any company from charging
..ore than one fare for cars going in any
one general direction, and as Sixth and
Fallon streets is the westerly shore oi
Lake Merritt, and Lincoin street rnns close
to the bay, the new road will certainly
lind a large share of traffic awaiting it.
Should tne new road be run in connec
tion with the Vaadercook system on
Eighth street it would, with the various
branches, be as large a consolidation as
that of F. M. Smith's syndicate. It is not
at all unlikely that the application for the
franchise, however, maybe largely in tha
nature of a powerful threat to force the
existing roads to give transfers across
the city.
CALL IT COERCION.
Streetcar Men Required to Go On
X'ecord Regarding Total
Abstinence.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. .26.â The em
ployes of the Oakland Consolidated Kail*
road .are being confronted with a pledge
which they regard very much as being a
coercive measure. It binds the signer to
abstain from intoxicating liquor at all
times, never to enter a saloon, and con
cludes with a clause dv which the em
ploye agrees that to be seen coming out of
n saloon shall be a sufficient ground for
dismissal.
The pledge has been presented to the
men for several days, but up to the pres
ent time not more than a dozen have
signed it out of fully 120 employed on the
DR. MYRA KNOX.
THE LADY WHO ACCEPTED AND THE LADY WHO REFUSED.
â¢ OAKLAND, CaiÂ», Jan. 26.â The Populist City Central Committee is somewhat disconcerted over the resignation of
"Mrs. Sarah C. Borland, who was nominated for School Director. The precedent for ladies serving on official boards in
Oakland was set two years ago, when Dr. Myra Knox waÃ elected to the School Board after being nominated by the Non-
Partisans. Mrs. Borland is an active worker, and is president of the City Political Equality Society, and would probably
have been elected. She gives no reason for declining the nomination.
Dr. Myra Knox, who was recently nominated by the Republican Convention for School Director at Large, has accepted
the nomination, and will without doubt be re-elected. At different times she has acted as president of the Board of
Education, and is one of the most indefatigable of workers.
road. The carmen feel that their posi
tions depend en signing the pledge, and
that the moral of the whole business is
"sign or make room for somebody else."
The secretary of the road says there is
no compulsion about the matter. "The
pledge was started," be said, "for the pur
pose of seeing how many total abstainers
we had in oar employ ami how many
would be willing to sign. The men who
sign it will not gain anything by so doing
and the man who does not sign will be in
no danger of losing his job."
The Consolidated road has always
boasted of having the most steady em
ployes in the city, and ex-Superintendent
Grim used to take a personal interest in
his raen. There is a Christian Endeavor
Society among them, a Y. M. C. A.
branch, both of which are well attended,
and the men are noted for their sobrie<y
and attention to duty.
It is considered a. piece of coercion to
present the pledge and the carmen are
unanimous in the opinion that so lar as
signing it is concerned it is a kind of Hob
son's choice.
Superintendent Rudolph, with whom
the idea originated, controls the Grove
street iine and its branches on Eighth and
Sixteenth street?, the Twelfth-street tvad
and the Highland Park and Fruitvu.e
road, and it is expected that the pledge
will be submitted to the employes of the
whole system.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1897.
DICK'S SACRIFICE
NOT IN VAIN
His Sister Priscilla Is Now
Able to Return to
Her Work.
Jitory of a Little Stipulation
Filed With the County
Clerk.
A Year Ago He Gave His Flesh That
His Sister's Hand Mi^ht
H^al.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 26. \
A little document was filed in the Su
perior Court to-day that tells a very pretty
story. It was a stipulation entered into
between Priscilla Overly and the Cascade
Laundry, by which the former waves all
claim against the laundry in considera
tion of a certain sum and a position at
such work as she is capable of performing.
Priscilla's brother, Diet, is as joyful
over the result of his sacrifice to relieve
his slater's injuries as any little hero can
be. Nearly a year aeo his sister met with
an accident with one of the ironing ma
chines la the laundry, and was so burned
that it became necessary if she were to be
properly healed, and have the use of her
hands, that some one should give enough
flesh and skin from their hvine body to
graft over 'the girl's wounds.
No sooner did little Dick, who was then
11 years of age, hear of his sister's plight
than he at once made up his mind to give
that which alone could ni I her.
The girl's father at tir-t offered to let the
necessary flesh betaken from his arm, but
as this would tafce him from his work for
some time the offer of little Dick was ac
cepted. He went out to the hospital like
a little hero and the physician took the
necessary matenal from his leg and for a
time brother and sister remained at Fabi
ola. It took him a long while to recover
from his sacrifice, but several months
have passed now s nee he was able to re
turn to his studies in the Lincoln School.
His sister's hand has thoroughly re
covered, rlthougti it will be a long time
before it regains its former streneth, and
consequently she will be provided with an
easy class of worK for some time.
Little Dick reler3 with pride to his suf
fering for ibe saKe of his sister and says
that although the ordeal did hurt him
somewhat, the satisfaction he now has
from seeing his sister able to use her hand
more than recompenses him.

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 26.â Three house

WILL PRESERVE SILENCE
Ebell Directors Will Pay No Attention
to Fairy Tale*.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 26.â The Ebell
Society director? held a meeting this
morning and decided that, so far as the
complaints recently made are concerned,
they will preserve a disnified silence.
There was perfect unanimity at the
meeting, and the directors decided that,
as there was. nothing wrong, tuere was
consequently no explanation necessary.
It was the sense of the board that the best
way to silence those who are trying to cre
ate dissension would be to take no notice
whatever of them.
Although the difficulty has been treated
in this manner, it is the general opinion
of the majority that the Ebell Society
will soon have to decide for itself
whether it soallbea literary or a social
organization.
This question is really at the bottom of
the present misunderstanding and there
are many who thins that the society is
drifting "away from its original purpose.
They declare unhesitatingly that the lit-

j erary atmosphere of the Ebell Temple has

j ture of a classical nature is being gradu

Mrs. President Bunnell declares that
j out of the 425 members there are not more
dissatisfied ones than she can count on

deijm to acknowledge that their attemot
' to make the club appear notorious is
worthy of the smallest consideration, and
there is no doubt that a vast majority of
the club is in harmony with the president.

of Livermore was discharged to-day by
Judge Clift on a charge of bigamy. The

his divorce from his first wife had been
granted that she cmnot possibly be per

MISSING LINKS
MAKE MYSTERY
C. C. Nordhausen Suffocated
From Internal Hem
orrhage.
He Is Thought to Have Been
Shot Outside the Bald
win Hctel.
Strange Reply to a r.eath-B?d Ques
t.cn â It- Taylor on the Wounds.
Police at Work.
Charles C. Nordhausen, the Oakland
capitalist, who was taken from his room
in the Baldwin Hotel last Monday morn
ins to St. Luke's Hospital, suffering from
a bullet wound in the left breast and
another wound in the forehead over the
right eye, died at the hospital at 3:30
o'clock yesterday afternoon. The bullet
punctured the lungs, as they were filled
with clotted blood, and he died of suffo
cation despite all that could be done to
relieve him and save his life.
Certain circumstances at the Baldwin
Hotel and a statement made by Mr. Nord
hausen at the hospital, after he was told
he was going to die, have thrown a mys
terious light upon the case, and given rise
to suspicions that, instead of accidentally
shooting himself, as he stated, Nordhausen
was shot by some one else.
The police have been made acquainted
with the details and Detective Whitaker
is investigating the affair.
Nordhausen left his home in Oakland
last Saturday, telling his wife he was going
to Randsburg, where he was interested in
some mining properties. For some rea
son, known only to himself, he did not go
to Randsburg, but went to the Baldwin
Hotel Saturday night and engaged a room.
It is said that he had then been drinking,
and the story from this point on Is about
as already published. It is not known
where he spent Saturday night, but all
day Sunday he was in his room, and fre
quently rang for drinks. He was not
noticed when he came in Saturday night,
and the time of his return isnot'known.
Sunday he frequently rang up bell
boys, ordered liquor and was liberally
supplied witii it by the drink and by the
bottle. He had the appearance on Sun
day of having been on a heavy debauch.
The bellboy also found the gas turned on,
but not lighted. Wnen Nordhausen's at
tention was railed to it he said he did not
care a blank if it was turned on.
When he called a boy about 7 o'clock
Monday morning he said he had shot him
self and demanded to be removed at
once to the hospital. The manager of the
hotel and Dr. W. E. Taylor, who lives at
the Baldwin, went to iho room to give
what aid they could. Nordhausen told
the doctor that he had accidentally shot
himself while dressing at 2 o'clock that
same morning.
He declined to be treated at the hotel
and insisted on being removed at once to
St. Luke's. Dr. Taylor made a brief ex
amination, despite Nordhausen's protests,
to see whether he was in danger of dying
while on the way to the hospital, and,
finding no immediate danger, though the
patient's pulse was high and feeble, indi
cating a hemorrnage somewnere, an am
bulance was summoned and in a little
while Nordhausen was where he wauled
to be â in the hospital.
It was only after Nordhausen's death
that surmises began to be made and appa
rently uiirecoiicilabie circumstances to
develop. Dr. Taylor said last evenine,
when asked about the condition of the
wounds when he was first called to see the
patient between 7 and 8 o'clock Monday
morning, that they looked to him to be
much more than six hours old.
He said he thought at the time, from
the examination he made, that the wounds
were inflicted long before 2 o'clock in the
morning, which was the time Nordhausea
said he had accidentally shot himself. He
said the blood in the wound in the fore
neact was very dry and had the general
appearance of having been inflicted twenty
four hours before.
The bullet wound near the left nipple
had also bled profusely, and it had caked
and dried into Nordhausen's undershirt.
The doctor thought also that thia wound
was aged more than six hours. There
was a slight burn around the bullet
wound in the breast, indicating that the
weapon had been fired close to the body.
From the looks of the gash in the fore
head it was impossible to tell whether it
was made by a bullet or some other blunt
instrument. When asked what he thought
about the case, Dr. Taylor refused to in
dulge in any surmises.
Dr. C. M. Armistead attended Nordhau
sen at the hospital. Yesterday afternoon
he told Nordhausen that he had but a
short time to live and asked if he had any
word to leave in regard to his property or
other matters.
Nordhausen replied that his affairs were
in good shape and he had nothing to say.
Dr. Armistead then asked him: "Who
was the woman who shot you?"
Nordhausen cast a glance at the physi
cian and said, in feeble tones: "Never
mind about that; It's done now."
A few minutes later be became con
scious, talked rainblingly about mines and
Randaburg and did not regain conscious
ness before he died. He had a touch of
delirium tremens Monday night.
The manager of the Baldwin told
Deputy Coroner McCormick and Detective
Whitaker that he thought that Nord
bausen's wounds had ben inflicted outside
the hotel. Circumstances which indicate
this ar~> that Nordhausen had a bandage
around his head on Sunday and the bell
boy said he leaned to one side when he
moved or walked as though he was suffer
ing pain in that side.
The body wai removed yesterday after
noon first to the Morgue and thence to an
undertaker's. A post-mortem examina
tion of the remains will be held to-day.
Nordhausen in said by a relative not to
have been a drinking man. He wrs all
right if he took only one drink of liquor,
but he became in a manner wild if he took
two drinks.
Mrs. Nordhausen called at the hotel and
hospital yesterday afternoon for the few
personal effects and trinkets, including a
diamond ring and a watch, which the de
ceased left. At the time of his death he
had $4 50 on his person, and is said to
have started for Randsburer with consid
erably more money. Mrs. Nordhausen,
her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. J.
H. Sonnichsen, are about prostrated with
grief. She has three children.
Detective Whitaker said at a late hour
last night that, from the investigations
na had made so far, he was inclined to
think it a case of accidental shooting.

her waiver to all interest in her husband's

C. Ainswortn Jr. and M. B. Ainsworth,
and then continues:
"Juat prior to the 18th of August, 1894,
I had several consultations with my said
stepson and my said sons relative to my
rights under the last will and testament
of the said John C. Ainsworth, and my
said stepson and my said sons told me
that under the provision of paragraph
thirteen of said will I was entitled to a
monthly income of $1000 during my life.
My best recollection is that my stepson
and sons advised me that such was the
advice of Arthur Rodgers, bui in this par
ticular I may be mistaken. At all events,
the statement was made to me by tUeni
that this was my interest under the will
and in view of that statement and without
consultation with any other person or per
sons I consented to waive any and all in
terest in the community property of said
estate, if any such there be, being perfectly
satisfied with such provision of $1000 pei
month for my life."

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tos'sea on the troubled sea of sexual weakness ,
until ' it was a question whether be had not
better take a dose of ; poison, and thus end all
his throubles. - But providential â  inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the â¢ general health, â  but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man .who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free.; Now, when I say free 1 mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast,' but there are thousands of men
Buffering the 'mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at onca could
they but get such a remedy; as the one that
cured me. ; \ Do not try to study out how I " can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary '

A BIG BATTLE FOR
LAVEAGA'S MONEY
It Was Begun in Judge
Coffey's Court Yes
terday.
Attorneys Lyons and Dwyer
Quote Antagonistic Code
Provisions.
Thousands of Doliars Involved in the
Question of Collateral Inheritance
by a Legitimate Child.
Argument in the J. Vicente de Laveaga
estate was opened in Judge Coffey'a court
yesterday morning by Attorneys Lyons
and McEnerney, representing the recog
nized heirs of the deceased, while Aitor
ney J. J. Dwyer spoke for Anselmo de
Laveaga, who claims to be the natural
son of .'. M. de Laveaga.
The estate amounts to about $900,000,
and there are five claimants, including
young Anselmo.
Anselmo was recognized and adopted
by his father and legitimated in the most
solemn manner. It is ackuowledged'on
all hands that the adoption of Anselmo
by his father is complete and indisputable
under the laws of this State, so far as the
rights of the young man to inherit from
his father's estate is concerned, yet
Messrs. Lyons and McEnerney argue that
he has no right to inherit collaterally
from his uncle Vmcente.
Addressing the court, Mr. Lyons said :
"Ii requires no argument to show that
this is true. A mere reading of the stat
ute is sufficient 10 establish our position."
Thereupon Mr. Lyons read section 1387
of tbe Civil Code of the State of California,
which so far as it pertains to the matters
involved in this litigation, provides:
Every illegitimate child is an heir oi any
person who in writing, signed in the preseDce
of a competent witness, acknowledges himself
to be tbe fattier of such child.
Mr. Dwyer returned a Roland for his
Oliver, and read section 230 of the Civil
Code, which says:
The father of an illegitimate child by pub
licly acknowledging; it as his own, receiving it
as such with the consent oi his wife, if he is
married, into his family, and otherwise treat
ing it as if it were a legitimate child, thereby
adopts it as such, and such <-hi!<i is thereupon
for all purposes legitimate from the time of its
birth.
Mr. Dwyer was not so positive in his as
sertion of his position as Mr. Lyons had
been, but he intimated that he thought
that the lawyers on tho other side would
have a hard time sweeping away that pro
vision of the code whicn makes the child
thus recognized "legitimate for ah pur
roses."
The court intimated that it regarded the !
question presented to be of great impor- j
tance, aside from the amount of property
involved, which is considerable. The
point in controversy is wnether a child j
thus acknowledged has a right to inherit
from his father's brother, the boy's father
having died before his unc!e. m view of
all the circumstances, the court desired to
jzive full ecope for argument by counsel.
The court i>ad no knowledge of "the ques
tion here Dresented ever being decided in
this State.
It was agreed that briefs shall be sub
mitted and that there shall also be oral
argument.
To strengthen the claim of the yonng
man Anselmo as an heir to a share of his
uncle's estate the allegation will be
pressed that a great share of Vincente's
estate was actually inherited from An
Â«eimo's father, and to back up Anselmo's
ripht lor an inheritance :t is pointed out
that he was recognized in nis uncle's
will and accorded a .iberal b quest, but
not as much aÂ« he woul i receive if de
clare'! an equal heir with the other
legatees under the will.
Intimation has been made that the
legal fight against Anselmo will include a
question of identity, and he will be called
on to establish the fact that he is. really
the chiiii of Vincente de Laveaga's brother.
Depositions of residents of Mexico will
be taken, as Anseimo was born in that
country, where his mother died several
years ago.
It is evident that a prolonged struggle
for the thousands of dollars has been be
gun, and it may be years before any of the
neirs will be in a position to enjoy the
fruits of victory.
WOMEN WRITERS.
Interesting F;:pers al the Monthly
Meetingâ A Musical Programme.
At the ruonthiy meeting of the Women's
Press Club Association, held in Shasta
Hall on Monday afiernoon, the following
excsllent programme, prepared under the
direction of Mrs. Frances Fuller Victor,
was presented to a large anaience:
Piano solo, (a) -'AufschmlDg" (Schumann),
(6) "Spinning Song" (Mend lssohn), Miss Mar
guerite O'Connell; paper, "Among the Alas
kans," Mrs. Maria Freeman Gray ; violin solo
(selected). Mile. H. Chamonde St. Hubert;
poem, "A Greeting to the Frost," Miss Harriot
M. Skidmore; paper, "The Army Woman."
Mr-;. J. J. O'Connell; song, "For All Eternity"
(Mascheroni), Mine. L. Steffani; violin obli
gato, by Professor Johansen, accompanied by
Professor Zilliani; paper, '-Across Some Pleas
ant Thresholds," Mrs. M. V. Tingley Lawrence;
violin solo, "Spanish Dance" (Sarusate), Pro
lessor Johansen; recitation (selected), Mrs.
Frances B. Edgerton.
Mrs. Hester A. Dickinson, president,
presided. Miss Alice G. Friedlander re
ceived and seated tbe guests.
Mis. Frances Edgerton failed to appear,
so Miss O'Conneh of Oakland favored the
audience with an extra selection on the
piano.
Mrs. Gray's paper, "Amone the Alas
kans," was very interesting. She de
scribed the island of Unalaska and the
habits of those that live on the island;
also the beautiiui scenery that greets the
eye at every turn in that region. The
poem by Miss Harriet M. Skidmore was
*-ell received, and she was prevailed upon
to read it twice.
"The Army Woman" was discussed at
length by Mrs. O'Connell, who went on
to say that tliere was no mote mistaken
idea than that garrison life was not one ot
unalloyed pleasure. She paid a tribute to
army officers in saying they are the most
devoted, self-sacrificing husbands in the
world, and the audience nvist have agreed
with her, for the remark was received
with much applause.
"Across Some Pleasant Thresholds" was
the title of the paper read by Mrs. Law
rence, and she described the surroundings
and interiors of such homes as those of
Julia Ward Howe, Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Mrs. William Hearst, Mrs. Field,
wife of the Chief Justice. Mrs. General
Logan, and closed with a touching tribute
to tbe memory of the late Mrs. Benjamin
Harrison, whose hospitality had been
accorded to her in the White House.

A LITTLE FAMILY SQUABBLE
AGITATING THE FAIR HEIRS
The Attorneys for Mrs. (blrichs and Her Sister Think
the Prosecution of Cooney a Bad
Move.
EXECUTORS OF A LIKE
OPINION.
The Millionaire's Son Insisted en
It Despite the Protest of
Other Interests.
A NEW WITNESS IGUND FORi
MBS. CKAVEN.
Webb Saw the Bonanza King in Hsr
House on the Date of the
Marriage Contract.
Tuere is discord in the ranks of the Fair
lawyers and beirs. While all lined up in
the common cause against Mrs. Craven |
and her pencil deeds, they have taken to j
quarreling atnonc themselves over the
best way to defeat these documents.
Cooney is the rock upon which they
have split. The prosecution of the young
notary in the criminal courts was an inno
vation in the programme of the campaign j
against Mrs. Craven prepared just after j
Dr. Marc Levin^ston withdrew the famous i
pencil will. Tne groundwork of the cvi- ;
dence upon which the police are now :
seeking to convict Cooney of perjury was j
laid by the attorneys for the special ad- J
ministrators of the estate, W. M. Pterson, /
R. B. Mitchell and Garret W. McÂ£n- I
erney. When detectives in the employ of j
these interests fell afoul of the records of j
the printing house of H. S. Crocker & Co. ;
the chestnuts they pulled out were to be
used not in a criminal prosecution of j
Coonev, but as a lever to duleat Mrs. Cra- !
yen's deeds in the civil litigation pending
before Judge Slack.
Captain Lees was atonce called in to aid
the cause of the estate. Every movement
of Fair on dates that have a vital bearing
on the big is-ues involved was duly traced
and chronicled. First of all Lees discov
ered tbat Fail was in San Rafael on Sep
tember 24, 1894u the day on which Mrs.
Craven says the dead bonanza king made
the pencil will in her house at 2uol Cali
fornia street, and handed her aeeds to
property worth $1,500,000 in the presence
of Mrs. Haskins. For a day or so the
cliief of detectives thought he had un
eartoed a mare's nest, but a -econd inves
tigation convinced him that Fair came to
ban Francisco during the day, returning
to the Marin County suburb in tne even
ing. There was more work along these
lines and the detective talent turned it
attention to Cooney and nis acknowledg
ments on the pencil deeds.
The Crocker printing-house story, as it
is now known, with its defective printing
defects, was the result of this labor. 'But
the discoveries which have since been her
alded with a flourish of newspaper type
by the Fair side of the case were originally
not to be made known at all. It was the
intention to spring them as a eort of mine
on Mrs. Craven, when she would be totally
unprepared for them, in the civil litiga- |
tion. The attorneys for the special ad
ministrators of the estate favored this
plan. So did .Reuben Lloyd and Russell
j. Wilson, the Jeeal advisers of Mrs. Her*
mann Oelrichs and Miss Virginia Fair.
It was Charles L. Fair, through his at
torneys, Knight & Heggerty, that jumped
over the traces. They were cognizant of
every move Lees and his detective force
made, and tne moment the Crocker story
was strung together they launched out in
the criminal prosecution of Coouey, in
spite of all sorts of protests on the part of
tne other attorneys in the case. McEner- |
ney and Pierson deplored this movement,
but once it was precipitated were forced to
give it all the support at. tneir command
in self-interest. Lloyd and Wilson fell in
line in a half-hearted way.
The wisdom of the move is seriously
questioned now by the executors and ad
ministrators, and rumor has it that youne
Fair is rather inclined to believe be made
a hasty jump. The exoneration of Cooney
would prove a serious blow to the cause of
the heirs. It would mean a tacit defeat j
of the Fair children in the first serious
skirmish they have taken part in. It I
would indirectly go a long way to estab
lish the validity and genuineness of
Cooney's part in the transaction, which is
one of the points the opposition have vig
orously opposed from the' inception of the
lawsuit. That is why, now that they
have been dragged into the legal pnddle,
every resource at the command of the
millions of. the dead bonanza king is now
directed to convict Cooney. Tbat is why,
also, there is a marked coolness between

McEnerney and Knight, and rumor has
it that Reuben Lloyd is not doing his
share to push the bandwagon along.
Captain Frank E. vV'e^b, in addition to
being the chief witness in Cooney s de
iense. is down as an important factor for
Mrs. Craven and her pencil deeds. Webb
will be called to narrate a visit he made to
Mrs. Craven's home at 823 Sutter street on
the nieht of May 23, }S',)2, the date of her
marriage contract witn James G. Fair.
On the evening of May 24, 1892, the pupils
of the Mission Grammar School gave an
r>:>nat!c entertainment at the Grand
Opera-uouse, and the preceding afternoon
was devoted to dress rehearsal, it has
i been n contention of the Fair people that
Mrs. Craven could not have supervised
the details of this rehearsal and at the
same time have performed such an impor
tant function as marrying James G. Fair.
They claim to have secured evidence to
prove that she spent the entire afternoon
at the opera-house, looking after the de
tails of the performance.
Webb is a brother of Mrs. Alma E.
Greenwell of Alameda, who at that time
was a pupil of Mrs. Craven and took a
prominent part in the operatic perform
ance.
"On the afternoon of the rehearsal,
which, oy the way, is the date of Mrs.
Craven's "marriage contract," said Webb,
"I went down to the Grand Opera-house
to see my sister. The rehearsal was pri
vate and a woman at the stage door re
fused my request for admission. I then
asked to see Mrs. Craven and was told
was not there. I thought I was being
'strung,' so to speak, and after a second
request to see my sister I left, rather out
of temper. I thought tilings were not
eoing right and made up my mind to have
my sister withdraw from trie pan she was
slated for in favor of her understudy. I
was pondering on this subject all the
afternoon and by evening my mind was
fully made up to tell Mrs. Craven of my
plans. I met her on Kearny street, in
front of Newman & Levmson's and re
galed her at once with my tale of woe.
She tried to smoothe matters over, and as
a last resort asked me to walk home with
her. As we went up the steps of her
liouse, at 823 Sutter street, the door was
opened for us by James G. Fair. He baa
evidently been watching for us through a
window, for just as she prepared to turn
the knob the key turned inside and tbe
Senator drew open the door. He stepped
aside into the parlor doorway for us to
pass dowu tbe hall. Mrs. Craven seemed
rather confused, and thinking I was not
wanted I hastily bid Mrs. Craven good-by
and left the house."
The Cooney people have been studying
up the subject of the evidence Handwrit
ing Experts Ames and Carvalho will give
at the trial, ana they are prepared to prove
that these experts have at times varied as
much in opinion as they agree on the
genuineness of the pencil deeds. In the
Twentietn Century for August there is a
reminiscence of a former disagreement of
tnese two judges oi handwriting. It is as
follows:
"A recent case in onr New York City
courts, when a merchant was almost rail
roaded to prison on the evidence of two
experts in handwriting, was the means of
bringing before tbe public again the fa
mous Garfield-Morey letter, and also
tnrowine new light on the historical
events of the Presidential campaign of
1880. The two experts, Messrs. Ames and
Carvalho, testified in the recent case that
a certain letter of a libelous nature was
written by the merchant in question. In
opposition to them was h. A. Spencer,
who provid that several of trie features in
the handwriting were common to otners
not at all interested in the case. Th re
fore the matter settled down to a question
of expert testimony, which developed the
fact that Mr. Carvalno testified in 1880 that
the Morey letter was in the handwriting
of Garheld himself, whereas Mr. Ames
charged oneKenward Philin as the author
of the forgery. Here we have two experts
holding different opinions on the more im
portant case, but agreeing on the more
recent one. During the imprisonment of
Kenward Philip, Governor Jewell, chair
man of the Republican National Commit
tee, engaged Mr. Spencer and his brothers
to investigate the case. These three ex
perts, authors of the Spenceri*>n school
publications, and practically experienced
in handwriting of all kinds, examined tbe
matter thorouehly and rendered their de
cision to Govrnor Jewell. That decision
exonerated Kenward Philip and vindi
cated General Garfieid. Tnis is the first
time that publicity was given to the inside
facts in question.
"It is alarming to contemplate that on
this unsound judgment of experts respect
ing handwritings men may be deprived of
their liberty who are as innocent as the
deceased Kenward Philip, and as blame
less as tbe world lamented Gartielu."
The Cooney case will be resumed this
morning. ______^_^^____

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1897.
THE DEFECTS IN PRINTING IN THE COONEY CERTIFICATES.
Captain Lees, in his attempt to prove that the notarial blanks used on the pencil deeds were printed by Crocker <fc Co. in
1896, over a year after the death of James G. Fair, has discovered thirty-six typoeraphical defects in the forms. But twenty-nine
of these are visible to the naked eye, the balance being revealed by the aid of a magnifying glass. The defects upon which the
case of the police will rest in a great measure are shown in the above reproduction of the Cooney acknowledgment. They are, 1,
defective "o" ; 2, defective "f"; 3, defective "leaders" in blank line; 4, worn "leaders": 5, defective "r" in word "hundred"; 6,
impression from worn ''leaders": 7, defective "f" in "before"; 8, another "leader" imperfection; 9, defective "f" in "for"; 10,
more "leader" defects; 11, defective "w" in "whose"; 12, dot over "a" in "name"; 13, another "leader" imperfection; 14.

SOCIETY HONORS
BISHOP NEWMAN
A Brilliant Gathering at
Mrs. Stanford's Re
ception.
Guests From Far and Near
Meet the Distinguished
Prelate.
The Mansion on the Hill Ablaz? With
Lights and Beautiful With
F.owsrs.
The wealth, beauty, wit and fashion of
the City and surrounding towns, aug
mented by distinguished representatives
of all the professions, met at the Stanford
mansion on California street yesterday
afternoon to meet Mrs. Stanford's guests
of honor. Bishop and Mrs. Newman.
The distinguished prelate and his wife
have for many years enjoyed the tender
friendship of Mrs. Stanford; in fact, be
tween Bishop Newman and the late Sena
tor Stanford existed a lifelong friendship.
When Mrs. Stanford conveyed to the
venerable churchman her sincere desire of
giving some form of entertainment to do
him honor it was at his own request 'that
the lady decided upon a reception.
Fifteen hundred invitations were issued
for the occasion, and. with few exceptions,
no regrets were received.
The guests came from far and near, and
never before in the social history ot the
State has one roof sheltered so mnny dis
tinguished people.
The details of the reception were ar
ranged with ail that attention to minutiae
which has always distinguished entertain
ments at which Mrs. Stanford has pre
sided.
The entire lower floor of the mansion
was thrown open to the guests. The apar
ments were brilliantly illuminated, and
the guests wandered ax will amid the rare
and costly collection of art with which the
house is filled.
But little floral decoration was found
necessary to embellish the vast apart
ments, and the few choice blossoms used
were placed with discretion and taste in
costly vases ana bowls where guou taste
directed.
In the dining-room a long table was set,
and some hundred garcods stood ready to
dispense all the delicacies of the season,
witn punch, coffee, tea and chocolate to
wash them down. â¢ '
In the art gallery the orchestra was
placed. Here also the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin clubs assisted, and in compli
ment to Mrs. Stanford rendered several
vocal and instrumental selections.
The hours of the reception were from 3
till 6, and /daring these hours there was a
constant stream of visitors to meet the
distinguished guests of honor. Each de
nomination sent two representatives, and
clergy and laymen mingled in the merry
throng.

BARRY-FLYNN FIGHT.
Flynn Forfeit* His Bail, and the Case
Against Barry Is Dismissed by
Judge Low.
Judge Low acted a? referee yesterday in j
the fight between Editors James H. Barry j
and Thomas E. Flynn that occurred on j
Montgomery street Monday morning.
The Judge had to decide which of the two,
or if both, had been guilty of disturbing
the peace.
Editor Barry appeared fresh and smil
ing in court, but Editor i?'iynn did not j
respond to his name when called by the I
rourt ciier. Judee Low promptly declared j
Flynn's bail of $10 forfeited.
Policeman Leonard was called to the
stand, and testified that he saw the two j
editors scuffling on the streets and placed :
them under arrest. He did not know who i
was the atreressor.
Editor Barry told tlie story of the en- ;
counter. He got off a Sacramento-street;
car at the corner of Montgomery street,
ana was walking toward his office when ;
some one came suddenly behind him ami â 
struck him with a cane. He turned round i
and saw FJynn with the cane uplifted to I
strike him aeain. He grappled with his !
assailant, took the cane from him, threw >
him into the gutter and was just goinc to i
chastise him when he was arrested. . !
The Judge promptly dismissed the case j
against Editor Barry, who walked out of j
the courtroom with a smile on his face.
