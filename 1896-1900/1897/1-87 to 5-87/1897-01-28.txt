Regarded as an Indication of an
Informal Tender of the
Piace.

retary of State.
HICAGO, 111., Jan. 27.â Lyman J.
J â -, president of the First National
' liaok of Chicago, received a telegram this
afternoon from Major McKinley, asking
him to come to Canton. Mr. Gage left on
the 11:30 train to-night over the Pennsyl
vania road and will arrive in Canton at
1 :30 to-morrow afternoon.
Major McKinley's message i* taken as
an indication that he will tender the
treasury portfolio to the Chicago banker. I
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 27.â The complex j
political probiem surrounding the selec- j
lion of Major McKmiey's Cabinet is now
believed to be practically solved, and
Lyman J. Gage of Chicago as Secretary of j
tjie Treasury is regarded as the key to th-^ j
â¢ituation, and -the almost certain choice of
â¢ the President-elect. This moral certainty
.is strengthened by the fact that the presi
dent of the First National Bank of Chi
cago is now on nis way to Canton, in re
sponse to Ihe telegraphed request of the
major to visit him.
Chairman Hanna came here and was
engaged for several hours to-day in con
sultation with Mr. McKinley. It is
thought that Mr. Hanna approved of Mr.
Gage as chj^f of the treasury. It is known
that ever since the election of Mr. McKin
ley powerful personal and political pres
sure has been exerted on the next Presi
dent, especially from friends and Repub
lican leaders in Chicago and the Middle
Western State, to procure the appointment
of Mr. Gage for the treasury portfolio.
The work has been done in such a quiet
and dignified manner that public atten
tion has not been directed toward the
influence until recently. It is now be
lieved that Mr. Gage's appointment to the
treasury will be determined this week.
. When that position is filled the other
portfolios can easily be disposed of. ex
cept as to that to be given to New York.
That problem remains as intricate as ever.
me impression prevails here th*t
enerai Woodford has the best chance of
appointment.
The President-elect does not seem to
have been influenced against General
"Woodford by the mild protest which was
entered against him yesterday from East
ern visitors.
Colonel John Hay is here in the interest
of a friend and does not now expect a
Cabinet position for himself.
Ex-Governor Osborn, who has been the
guest of Cornelius Bliss at Jeykill Island,
on the Georgia Coast, will remain here
until Friday and then return East.
Mr. Hanna's visit is not taken to have
any bearing on the Ohio Senatorial situa
tion. Cabinet and inauguration matters
engrossed the time of his conference with
Major McKinley.
Governor Bushnell has received a letter
from Senator Sherman, stating that he
â¢will not resign his seat in the Senate until
he is con firmed as Secretary of State.
ZIMaX J. GAOL'S CAREER.
Waa at One Time Sight Watchman at a
Lumber- Yard.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 27.â Lyman J.
Oage, the foremost financier in the West
ern metropolis, and who is likely to suc
ceed Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle,
â was born at DeÃnyter, Madison County,
N. V., June 28. 1836. His parents, Eli A.
and Mary Judson Gage, were descended
from English stock, and were born in New
York State. Lyman was taken to Rome,
JJ. V., when 10 years old and placed in
the Rome Academy, where he remained
four years. His term in that institution
practically constituted his entire scholas
tic education.
His first position in business Jife was as
clerk in the Rome postoffice, and later he
became route agent on the Rome and
"Watertown Railroad. In 1854 Mr. Gage
m obtained his first bank position, being
\ employed in the Oneida Central Bank, at
Borne, at a salary of $100 a year.
He remained there a year and a half,
and in the fall of 1885 he arrived in Chi
cago. He took the first job he could get,
â  with a lumber-yard and planing-mill firm.
He was engaged as bookkeeper, but he did
other utility work, such as loading and
unloading lumber and teaming. The ex
treme business depression of 1858 com
pelled the firm to dispense with his ser
vices .is bookkeeper, but rather than fcave
â¢ no job at all Mr. Gage worked for six
weeks as night watchman of the firm's
property.
â  While engaged in that humble but
bread-winning capacity the opportunity
of Mr. Gage's life came to him in the
shape of on offer of a position as book
keeper for the Merchants' Savings, Loan
and Trust Company.
From that position, nearly two score
year> ago, Mr- Gage's career has been up
. ward by long, steady strides until now he
occupies the highest position which can
be attained in any financial institution in
Chicago, that of president of the First Na
tional Bank. In the spring of 1860 he had
become assistant cashier of the Merchants'
Bank; later cashier, which office he held
until 1868, when he accepted the same
position in ttie service of the First Na
tional Bank with which he has remained
continuously. His promotion was rapid.
The old charter of the bank expired in
and upon the reorganization of the
â¢ bank Mr. Gage was elected vice-president
and general manager.
About the same time a* special compli
rn nt was paid to his abili y as a banker
by his election to the presidency of the
American Bankers' Association. About
two years ago this week Mr. Gage was
elected president of the bank on the re
tirement of Mr. Nicholson, although Mr.
The San Francisco Call
LYMAN J. GAGE, Probable Secretary of the Treasury in President
McKinley's Cabinet.
Gage had been the real president of the <
bank for several years.
At the inception of the World's Fair
enterprise, Mr. Gage showed his faith in
the financial outcome, guaranteeing, with
three other eentlemen, that Chicapo would
carry out her part of the contract and
raise $10,000,000, which was largely in
strumental in securing the fair for Chi
cago.
Mr. Gaffe was the first president of the
World's Fair directory, but on his eleva
tion to the presidency of the bank, he was
obliged to retire from the presidency of
that board. He refused to accept any of
the princely salary the directors had set
aside for the president of the directory.
Mr. Gage has been married twice â first j
in 1864 to Miss Sarah Eiheridge, daughter '[
o; Dr. Francis B. Etheridge of Littl- Falls, ,
N. V., who died in 1874, and in 1887 to |
Cornelia Gaee of Denver, Colo. He is a !
lover of art and literature, beinff a director
of the Art Institute, and spends many of
his evenings in his library, although be- j
ing con-iderable of a club man and a fre- j
quent figure at banquets.
SB ERMAX HVGUEsia IIAX\A.
But It In Thought Qorernor Bushnell
Will Aot appoint Him.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 27.â Governor
Bushneil to-night admitted that it was
true that Senator Sherman had written a
letter to him in regard to his resignation
from the Senate. He said the letter was
private and as he had regarded it as con
fidential he would still do so, though he
might ultimately give it to the public.
No one but himself ha:l seen it. He
would say, however, what every one would
guess anyhow, that the Senator told him
that he would probably soon resign and
that he thought it would be best lor the
party and for the State and country if
Mr. Hanna would be appointed as his
successor.
It is generally believed that the Gov
ernor will not comply with Senator
Sherman's request and his manner of
speaking of the advice he had received
frpm the Senator seemed to corroborate
this view of it.
AN EARLY TARIFF BILL
Hanna Speaks of the Programme of the
New Administration â Dinghy and
Aldrich at New York.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 27.â A Sun
special from Canton, Ohio, says: Chair
man Hanna left at 4 o'clock this afternoon
for Cleveland. Before leaving he gave, in
a somewhat indirect way, the programme
for early legislation under the incoming
administration.
He referred to the current gossip that it
is the intention of Major McKinley to
convoke. Congress in an extra session on
ASSEMBLYMAN TREACY, Who Is Looking Out for the Interests
of the Bakers.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, JANUARY 28, 1897.
March 15, and he also intimated strongly
that an understanding has been reached
with the doubtful Senators which insures
the success of an administration tariff
bill.
The programme as arranged is that
Chairman Dingley of the Committee on
Ways and Means' where the bill will orig j
mate, will frame a bill.
He is at it now and Senator Aldrich is
assisting him and preventing the incor
poration of any clause that will meet
with objection in the upper branch of
Congress. When the measure reaches the
Senate he is to pilot it througn.
The programme, as it is arranged, calls
for tire passage of a bill within sixty days,
and the schedules to be arranged so as
that the measure would be in full force
and effect with the beginning of the fiscal
year, on July 1.
The bill is to be distinctively a protec
tion bill, incorporating, so far as it is
practicable, the main features of the Mc-
Kinley law, but the first requirement of
the new measure is that it shall produce
sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the
Government.
The desire of the administration, Mr.
Hanna said, is to get the tariff measure
into operation as soon as possible, so that
the country may experience the relief of
its increased revenues. That, he said, is
what the country needs, and until it is
secured no substantial improvement can
be expected. He expects an era of pros
perity to immediately follow the enact
ment of the new tariff bill and hopes for
but little relief irom the present depres
sion before that time.
QUITS HER GIPSY LOVER.
After a Violent Quarrel Princess Chimay
Pecks Her Trunks and Leaves
for Monte Carlo.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 27.â A dispatch to
the Mail from Vienna says that a violent
quarrel occurred between Princess Chi
may, formerly Clara Ward of Detroit, and
Janos Rigo, the Hungarian gipsy musican
for whom the Princess recently deserted
her husband. The screams of the Princess
j and the violent language of Rigo created
! great excitement and alarm among the
| guests of the hotel where the couple were
staying and coniplaiift was made to the
landlord. The affair ended by the depart
, ure of the Princess, who started unat
i tended by tue.eypsy for Monte Carlo.
Before leaving the Princess paid her own
share of the board due at. tho hotel, but
refused to pay that unpaid by Rigo, who
is consequently in an awkward position,
being in need of money to settle his ac
count. . . . .

Their Cause at Sacra

Hugh Craig.
Senator Gil'ette Suggests a Compro
miseâFurther Hearing Deferred
to Next Wednesday.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27.â The
Committee on Commerce and Navigation
held a late session in the Senate to-night
and was addressed by Lawyer Frank of
San Francisco, attorney for the pilots,
who said that to-day sixty disengaged
ships were lyinp; In San Francisco harbor
waiting lor freight. Captain Barber spoke
also, and said that only one-ninth of all
the vessels entering San Francisco harbor
were American, the others bein.; foreign.
He said that Captain Plummer remarked
that he didn't care how much pilotage
was charged foreign vessels so lone as his
own vessels were not charged so much.
Captain Plummer argued that a com
petitive system' 1 of pilotage would send
boats fifty or sixty miles outside the
Farallones picking up vessels. Pilots
would then seek business instead of busi
ness seeking them. He was asked whether
he knew of any port in the world that did
not have compulsory pilotage, and he re
plied that he did not and bad not studied
the matter.
Hugh Craig of San Francisco remarked
that the worm had turned to kick. He
charged that big shipowners were "al
lowed rebate which they were not required
to pay," while the small owners were the
sufferers. No association or company had
a right to monopolize the business of
pilotage and to pay rebates to certain
shipowners which it did not allow to
others.
The speaker poohpoobed the idea that
tie occupation of a pilot was dangerous.
Pilot-boats were the most seaworthy of
all cralt, and he had never heard of a pilot
being drowned. He suggested that the
whole receipts of pilotage should go into
the State treasury. No foreign man-of
war required a pilot to take it into the
harbor of San Francisco,' because they
knew the entrance to this harbo- so well
that they could come in in the dark or in
a fog.
Craig asked how it was possible that the
State should allow pilots to c-iarge so
much in excess of the value of tneir ser
vices that they could afford to rebate
thousands of dollars. Tne fees should be
paid into the State treasury, and then the
pilots could be paid handsomely for their
services.
Senator Gi'lette. through Senator Braun
hari, suggested a compromise to the effect
that the pilot fees should be reduced and
paid into the public treasury; that the
boats be maintained out of the treasury
and the pilots paid a liberal salary. Lawyer
t rank asked for more time to consider the
proposition.
At 11:30 p. m. the committee adjourned
until next Wednesday night at 8 o'clock.

Bow Additional AÂ«meÂ» Were Attached to
the Temporary Roll.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27.â There
was a not very lively session of the Duck
worth investigation committee this after
noon. Mr. Duckworth was still too sick
to get out and the committee went on
without him.
E. S. Gridley, journal clerk, was called
to the stand. He produced his records
showing Duckworth's original list of ap
pointments; also a letter from Duckworth
to the State Printer, in which Duckworth
stated that in copying the names for the
Printer he (Duckworth) bad omitted the
name of C. H. Rodriguez, and he there
fore asked the State Printer to put the
name in the journal of the next day.
He also showed a slip of paper with th 6
name ot J. L. Martin on it. This, the
witness could not explain, except that
somebody had given it to the State
Printer to add to the list. The other
names were placed in the journal.
Minute Clerk Wickham was called, but
he could not make any lucid explanation.
He did not think that Duckworth hart any
right to go over and correct the minutes
without sending the correction through
him. Neither bad he any right to go to
the printing office and make the correc
tion.
Mr. Gridley was recalled and said that
on January 6 another list of names was
handed to him by Wickham or Duckworth,
he was not certain which one of them. He
knew that it was one of them, because he
would not have received such a list from
any one else. It was a further correction
of the journal of January 4. The journal
was corrected so as to include this list of
names. What is known as the bond copy
of the journal included this list of names.
They were handed in by Duckworth on
the 6th. Speaker Coombs instructed him
(Gridley) to insert that list in the journal
as a correction.
These names had been suggested by
mem bera in the body of the house â he
did not know whom. Bond copies of the
journal are printed on bond paper, with
blank spaces for the signatures of the
clerk and the Speaker, and these aie filed
with the Secretary of State. The. bond
copies show that these men were ap
pointed on January 4, whereas in fact
they were appointed on the 6th.
North of Alameda, the next witness,
produced a list of attaches with the names
of the members who had recommended
them to Mr. Duckworth, but at the request
of Judson C. Brusie, counsel for the chief
clerk, the list was not read nor given to
the press, not being admitted in evidence
because of the absence of Mr. Duckworth,
who wished to make some corrections in
the list. The committee adjourned sub
ject to the call of the chair.
Speaker Coombs denies emphatically
that ka ordered the additional names

Furniture Taken from the Hooma of
Z>rgi*lntive Committees,
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27. â The
bills for furnishing committee-rooms of
the Senate were presented to-day. The
aggregate exceeds $500. The chairman of
the committee which passed on the ac
countsâSenator Hollowayâ said the high
est retail prices had been charged. It was
developed in the discussion that $641
worth of furniture purchased two years
ago had been appropriated by various
offices in the Capitol, the Governor's office
taking a good share. Senator Smith was
vigorous in his condemnation of this plan
of grabbing desks and etiairs from com
mittee-rooms. He insisted that State
officers should furnish their own offices,
paying for the furniture with money
allowed them for that purpose.
It was not fair that the Legislature
should be made the scapegoat for all the
wrongdoing about the Capitol.
The npshot of the discussion was the
appointment of a committee, consisting of
Senators Smith, Gillette and Dickinson,
to ascertain what had become of the fur
niture purchased by the Senate two years
aeo, and to ascertain iurther if the expen
sive desks and chairs recently bought
ought not to be returned, with proper
compensation for their temporary use.
Leave of absence for sixteen Senators to
visit public institutions was granted to
day. The delegation will go to Stockton,
Santa Clara, Los Angeles, San Ber
nardino and San Diego.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27.â
warm discussion between Assemblymen
Leavitt and Caminetti over the motion to
reconsider the vote by which the $75,000
appropriation for the State Printing
Office was passed was the only interest
ine feature of , to-day's proceedings in the
lower house. Mr. Caminetti stated that
New York State t>aid out less for State
printing than did California. This fact,
be said, was not due to heavy orders from
California State officials, as alleged by the
Ways and Means Committee, but .to
gross extravagance in the State Printing
Office.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SAYS LITTLE PETE
RACED TO THE END
Trainer Rainier Tells How
He Bought Three Horses
for Him.
Stories of Bribed Jockeys, False
Colors and a Big Coup
Spoilt by Death.
A Sensational Statement That if Veri*
fi d Will Implicate Some of the
Most Noted Trackmen.
The latest sensational sequel of "Little
Pete's" untimely demise is the statement
by James B. Ranier that the little nabob
was not "ruled off" the turf as effectually
as supposed last spring.
Pete had apparently been "pla ying the
horses" in his peculiar way up to the time
of his death, and on Saturday next the
big coup of months of crafty manipulation
of track men was to have been "pulled
off." The story implicates some ot the
most famous jockeys and owners on
the tun.
James B. Kainier is, according to him, a
horse-trainer. He said last night:
"After Pete got ruled off 1 operated for
him on the racetrack, and while he has
not been betting heavilyâ only a hundred
or two at a timeâ he has been working in
other ways.
"At his suggestion I bought three
horses. I bought them at a good price, on
the condition that the people, in whose
names they stood, would go on racing
them in their colors, but at my orders.
"It was a snap. If Pete had lived only
a week longer the bookkeepers out on the
tract next Saturday would not have had
sufficiont to pay car fare home. He would
have cleaned up at least $200,000.
"Why, I gave the widow $1800 to-day,
the proceeds of one winning on one of our
horses on Friday in Oakland. Now I have
sold the horses at a pretty good price, and
will turn the checks over to the widow.
"Pete's play was this: He gave me a
note, or power of attorney, six months
ago, saying, 'Anything this man does or
says for me I will stand by.' Well, I
always had some money on hand to treat
the 'push,' and the jockeys and I would
put up champagne for the high-toned
ones and perhaps steer them into good
feminine company.
"Then when my man was mellow I
would suggest that he wasn't riding for
bis health, and that all I wanted him to
do was to ride one race for roe â be to get
50 per cent of the winning. They all knew
Little Pete would divide fairly when he
said, 'You shall have your cut.'
"One crackajack jock came to town, and
when I broached the proposition to him
and showed him Little Pete's note he was
a little leary. He said he never did busi
ness with any but principals.
" 'Vsry well,' I aaid. 'Here's a hack;
jump in and I'll take you to my prin
cipal.' I took him up to Cninatown and
baited the hack a little below Pete's. I
left him in the back and went up and got
Pete and introduced him. Pete climbed
into the back and I left them there.
"They drove off together and when I next
saw that jockey at the track, he said: 'It's
all right; whenever you want me to ride
for you, just give me the word.'
"I tell you we had five of theni (the
jockeys) sure. It was the greatest thing
ever done. There was no playitig for
place, bui just straight winning. The
names of the jockeys are known every
where, and the alleged owners of our
horses are some of the biggest people on
the turf.
"1 have documentary evidence of what
I say, including some interesting letters.
"Aly arrangement with Little Pete was
for running expenses and wages for the
time being. We were looking for the big
clean-up on Saturday. When that came
I was to have 50 per cent of the total pronts
of the game.
"And I would have got it sure. Pete
was square. When he said 'You shall
have your cut' that was enough, and he
never threw me down yet. I understood
some one had got hold of part of the story
and so I thought it best to make a clean
breast of it."
Mr. Eainier's sensational story is of the
kind to furnish considerable food for solid
thinking to lovers of square racing and
may bear fruit on investigation.

Hearing Accorded at Sacramento by
the Committee of the Legis
lature.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27.â R00m
72 was too small to hold the Committee
on Labor and Capital and tbe crowd of
persons representing the different inter
ests in the several bills before the commit
tee. Assembly bill 282 was first taken up.
It provides that it shall be unlawful for
any person confined or employed in any
penal institution in this S'.ato to engage
or be employed in the manufacture of
anything whatever that is an article of
commerce in this State, except jut* bags
and broken stone for roads and highways.
The bill does not apply to the manufac
ture of any article consumed in the penal
institution where manufactured.
Oscar Lewis introduced a mbstitute pro
hibiting the quarrying of raw material or
the manufacturing of any article of com
merce except jute bags and broken stone
for use in country roads only.
Mead of Los Angeles said that it would
be better to allow cf\shed rock to be sold
to contractors and cities for street im
provement, because such street work would
employ a much larger number of laborers
than the number that would be deprived
of wort in the stone quarries by virtue of
the competition of the prison at Folsom.
Powers, an attorney, informed the board
that cut stone was beine made by convict
labor in Folsom for sale to private con
tractors.
City Trustee Devine of Sacramento, a
stonecutter by occupation, said that if
the stonecutters in the Folsom prison
would be allowed to supply small dealers
in cut stone with material for their work,
two stonecutters would be employed
where only one was employed at present.
He argued in favor of supplying municipal
corporations and others with broken
stone for street purposes. It would not
be necessary to create a commission to
attend to this matter, because Warden
Aull and his assistants would be amply
sole to take care of it, and to supply
Board) of Supervisors with the informa
tion needed by them.
City Trustee Bentiey of Sacramento said
that tbe private quarry at Cordelia could
not turn out in one year enou b rock to
complete one job of street work in Sacra
mento. That statement was mane by M.
McDonald, one of tbe most extensive con
tractors in the State.
Mr. Thomasson, owner of the Cordelia
quarry, said that the capacity of his quarry
was 250 tons per day, while the capacity of
the FuiÂ«om crusher was between 400 and
500 tons. He had not sold a quarter as
much rock last year as be did the year be
fore. He did not make two months' rnn
on his quarries during the whole of last
year on account of the competition of the
Folsom crusher.
"With regard to the argument that cheap
convict-made macadam material would
give employment to many more men than
were now employed in street wort, he
said that in bis experience in quarrying
with 103 men he produced a quantity of
rock which would employ Qnly ten men
to spread on the streets. It would be
necessary to put ten convicts at work in
order to give one free man employment
on the outside in handling the material
after it left the quarry ; so, in order to give
ten men work on the streets, the bill pro
posed to throw ninety free quarry men out
of work.
Tbe speaker contended that the trap
rock taken from the Folsom quarry was
not so good road metal as basalt rock, and
that the testimony of engineers was that
basalt was the best rock for macadamiz
ing. He surprised the committee by stat
ing that owing to the competition of
prison labor he would be oblieed to close
his quarry after the termination of his
contract with Mr. McDonald. He would
lose $8000 per year if he continued to oper
ate his quarry.
Mr. The mason also called attention to
the fact that the State did not derive one
dollar's Trorth of revenue from the rock
crushing plant. The State had donated
the power, the plant and the labor, and
the Prison Directors were not allowed to
charge any more than the actual cost of
tbe wear and tear of the machinery and
the oil used in lubricating the machinery.
Oscar Lewis of San Francisco addressed
the committee on behalf of the laboring
people of San Francisco. He began by
saying that the original idea of the
Bureau of Highways was in connection
with the rock-crushing plant, and it was
the understanding that nothing was to be
charged for the power or the labor of the
prisoners and that the State should
charge only 10 per cent above the cost of
tbe wear and tear, the power and the oil
used on the machinery.
"But it is contended here," said Mr.
Lewis, "that because Sacramento, Stock
ton and Marysville are within the radius
of cheap transportation from the Folsom
quarry the people of the whole State
should be taxed 10 support that institu
tion for the benefit of those three cities.
The principle is wrong. It is the growing
idea all over the States of this Union to
confine convicts to such work and to the
production of such things as are used in
the prisons. New Yoik State is now con
fining its prisoners to the manufacture of
such articles as are consumed in the pris
ons.
"You might just as well come here,"
added Mr. Lewis with warmth, "and ask
the State to furnish the city of San Fran
cisco with a tiounnill, so that we could
pet cheap flour and bread for the working
people of that city. Bo far as the rock
plant is concerned at the present time, you
have done nothing but exercise your pris
oners. You might just as well have ex
ercised them in riding bicycles, for it
would be much cheaper. You have not,
with all this prison labor, earned even a
cup of coffee for the convicts.
"Let the State charsre enough for the
rock, so that at least the cost of produc
tion, including to some extent the main
tenance of these prisoners, comes back to
you; otherwise I don't see where the tax
payer has any advantage. It is a one
sided proposition."
Walter McArthnr of San Francisco was
tbe next speaker. He said that he did not
consider tne bill a measure in the interest
of labor. Tbe laboring people opposed
emphatically any form of prison competi
tion with free labor and drew an arbitrary
.line at the prison gate:
' All that was necessary for the mainten
ance of tbe prisoners should be manufac
tured inside the prison walls, but they
should not be allowed to make anything
for consumption outside tne prison gates.
The tendency of the present age was to do
away with prison labor, added Mr. Mc-
Arthur. Several of the Southern States
had abolished the system of renting out
convict labor because it impoverished the
free labor of the State.
"If you start prison labor in the produc
tion of raw material for the construction
of roads, how can you stop short of put
ting convicts at work in the proJuction of
raw materials necessary in other lines of
industry? They mignt just as well be
put at work in coal mines aDd in lumber
mills and on the farm to provide wool
and cotton raw material. The next prop
osition two years hence might be to em
ploy convict labor in building county
roads, and there will be no end to it. By
prison labor, if this idea be carried out, the
working classes of this Republic will be
reduced to a condition of serfdom. Poor
working people are those who are injured
more by competition.
"Why not put freemen to work on the
roc:k-crusher?" asked Mr. Me Arthur.
"Supposing that we didn't have any con
victs? !â¢ say that this is a measure to
make convicts, and instead of decreasing
tbe taxation for the support of penal in
stitutions you will have more penal in
stitutions in the State to support.
Assemblyman Canavan asked what
should be done with the convicts â should
they be idle.
"No sir," replied Mr. McArthur, "you
could pu* them at nork making their own
clothing and improving prison buildings.
If it comes to a choice between finding
work for convict labor or for free labor it
is a choice between two evils, and 1 think
that free labor should be given work first.
If convicts go insane and commit suicide
because they have no work to keep their
minds occupied, why not keep the lowest
freeman from committing suicide?"
Cutter of Yuba remarked that if con
victs made their own cloihing they would
to that extent compete with free labor.
He announced that tbe city of Marysville
would require 700 carloads of crushed rock
for the street this â¢ummer. The putting
of this quantity of material into tbe
streets would employ many men and con
tractors were pledged by a bill which bas
passed the Assembly to pay thoir laborers
on public work $2 per day.
Mead moved that tbe bill and tbe sub
stitute be referred to a sub-committee of
three, with instructions to prepare a sub
stitute for both, limiting tbe v c of prison
crushed rock to public work. Tbe motion
was adopted, and Mead, Canavan and
Landsborough were appointed aa tbe sub
committee.

Enactment.
Ex-Mayor Sutro's Attorney in
Vain Declares It an
I justice.
The Lawmakers From the Metropolis
Consider the C mc.cry
Question.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27. âAn
old-fashioned meeting of the San Fran
cisco delegation of the Senate was neld
this evening to consider cemetery closing
and reducing street railroad fares. Sena
tor Mahoney, chairman, presided, and
had a great deal of trouble in restraining
Senator Braunbart from eloqu nt out
bursts. Martin Kelly, president of the
Good Government Club, was a spectator.
The substitute for Senate bill 230, which j
allows sixty tickets to be purchased at 2>Â£
cents each and compels street railroads at
certain towns to carry passengers for _' J
cents fare, provoked the discussion. Major
McKinney, attorney for Adoiph Sutro,
opposed the bill. He said it cost $1 a trip
for every car run from the en>] of the
Siitter-street road to the Cliff and return.
The road, ha said, would lose money if
the fares were reduced. He citea the
Castro-street line, which did not pay at
first, and was constructed only when the
Crockers were assured that the money
would ccme back during the closing years
of tbe fifty-year franchise.
"Great injustice would be done to cut
the fare now," said the major.
The sentiment of the delegation favors
tbe passage of the bill. The bill has been
recommended "to pass," and that order
was not changed.
Senate bill No. 306, prohibiting the
burial of the dead within the corporate
limits of any incorporated city after the
year 1900, called out animated talk.
Mi. Hubbs, president of tbe Richmond
Improvement Association, spoke in favor
of the bill. He p;H*e to each member of
tbe delegation a printed copy of Mayor
Phelan's message, favoring the closing of
cemeteries. This gave ez-Supervisor
James W. Burling an opportunity to say
that if Mr. Pbelan had made, before the
election, the declaration in favor of closing
the cemeteries he would not have been
elected.
Burling said there was no demand from
residents of San Francisco in favpr of
closing the City cemeteries. The agita
tion, he asserted, came from the syndi
cate of San Mateo cemeteries. They
wanted to break up the cemetery business
in San Francisco.
President Fletcher of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club presented a petition
signed by 1400 residents of San Francisco
p.gainst the passage of tbe bill.
In view of the importance of the sub
ject and the fact that several San Fran
cisco members were going on the Southern
California junket further consideration of
the cemetery bill was deferred until next
Wednesday evening.
The Senate committee to count the bal
lots in the Hall contest will not meet until
to-morrow morning.
SPEAK FOR hHBE CVBA.
Populist Orator* liaise Their Voices in
thn L-gittlnlure.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27. â The
Populists aeclared war on Spain this
morning and recognized the independence
of Cuba, but owing to the defective quality
of their ammunition â it being composed
chiefly of compressed wind and fusion
gas â no harm was done either to Spain or
the United States.
The harmless explosion of bottled venge
ance was set off by Assembly joint reso
lution 17, reported from the Committee ou
Federal Relations, relative to the struggle
of the people of Cuba for a free and inde
pendent Government. The resolution was
to the purport that it would be better for
the Congress of the United States to act
in the matter as its best judgment might
dictate.
Burnett, a Fusionist from Paso Robles,
-who had not been heard from very ofte n
duriirg the session, took the floor and
made a speech, which from the manner of
it 3 delivery must have been a studied
effort. He was in a high state of indigna
tion and punched and cross-countered
and uppercut the air with vicious lunges
of his right fist. He said that the atti
tude of the United States was a disgrace
and that the method of warfare adopted
by Spain in the wholesale murder of men,
women and children, and the wanton de
struction of property, was such as should
provoke the decided and immediate inter
vention of the United States. He there
fore offered a substitute resolving that we
extend the warmest sympathy to the
people of Cuba; that the time t.ad long
since passed when this Government
should have acknowledged the independ
ence of Cuba; that the methods pursued
by Spain in her efforts to subjugate Cuba,
including wholesale murder, outrage and
pillage, called for immediate action on
the part of this Government, and there
fore the Congress of the United States was
requested to acknowledge the independ
ence of Cuba.
North of Alameda expressed the hope
that the belligerent substitute would not
pass. There were likely to be many
changes in the Cuban situation before
Congress took up the matter, and it would
ba more prudent, he thought, to trust to
the discretion of the Representatives in
Congress and not hamper them will* war
like resolutions from afar.
Populist McCleilan from Hanford made
a warm speech in favor of Burnett's sub
stitute. Valentine (R.) of Los Angeles
spoke in favor of the original r*port of
the Committee on Federal Relations.
Matters of legislation should be left to
Conpress, he said. Melick (R.) of Los
Angeles said that he paid a visit to Florida
not long ago and there learned of the
frightful atrocities committed by the
Spanish troops upon Cuban men, women
and children, but the Legislature
of California was so far away from the
scene of action that it waa fair to presume
that Congress knew what was best to be
done and could be trusted to do the right
thing when the time came.
The Populist substitute was avalanched
beneath opposing votes and the report of
the committee was adopted.
FOR Ht.ll Eli HIGH W* TS.
Three Bills Providing for an Extensive
> System. ,
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. Three
bills of probably as great importance as
any that have been introduced this ses
sion are:
Assembly bill 596, introduced by En
nis, denning a great system of State
highways. The highways provided for in
the bill are the main lines of travel, and
traverse every county in the State.
They touch every county aeat, and every
town in the State of 1500 or more inhabit
ants is connected by means of them. It
is a system that it may take a number of
years to construct, but if finished it will
give California one of the greatest systems
of highways in the world, excelled only
by thos- of a few European countries.
These State highways are, however, only
the main lines of travel. The other roads
of the State are still left under county
jurisdiction.
Assembly bill 595, introduced by Ennis,
provides for the levying of an ad valorem
tax of 2)4 cents on the $100 of assessed
valuation of nil property of the State for
the constiuction and maintenance of the
great system sf State highways outlined
in the preceding bill.
Assemhly bill 597, introduced by Clark,
provides for the creation of a department
of highways to manage the State highways
and to give advice to local officials when
they request it. This department would
take the place of the Bureau of Highways,
which goes out of existence in April.
These bi.ls are companion* and are de
pendent upon one another. It was found
necessar>- on account of constitutional re
quirements to pat the matter in separate
bills rather than in one as first intended.

DES MOINES, lowa. Jan. 27.â Three
busy sessions were held by the National
American Suffragists to-day. The fore
noon was marked by a sharp clash be
tween the Eastern and Western delegates,
in which the West came off victorious.
It arose when the report of the committee
on campaign conditions was called for by
Anna L. Diggs of Kansas, a Populist and
co-worker of Mary Ellen Lease. Mrs.
Diggs was not present, but had sent her
rerort.
It stated that Republicans and Demo
crats were firmly set against woman
suffrage and there was no hope of friendly
action by them. The Populist party con
tained the greatest proportion of advo
cates of suffrage, but the party manage
ment -had set its face firmly against any
thing that would jeopardize the industrial
emancipation for which the party i* wort

Mrs. Diggs recommended that political
work be placed in the hands of the women
affiliated with the dominant parties in the
several States.
As to Kansas she said since the defeat

in 1894, the cause was hopeless there.
The report did not please the conven
tion and after it had been referred to a
committee for consideration, a resolution
was presented providing for censorship of
all reports before they were read to the
convention. Tne Eastern women favored
and the Western opposed it as Deing un
democratic, and the Westerners won the
day.
The report of the treasurer showed a
favorable condition of affairs witn finances
in good condition. Nineteen States were
represented in thÂ« convention, entitled to
cast 225 votes.
The committee on plans for work rec
ommended that it be pushed in Western
States, especially California, Oregon,
Washineton, Nevada and lowa, and that
efforts in other States be abandoned for
the time being.
A proposal to remove National head
quarters to New York came from one
branch of the committee and other like
proposals from other members. This will
be fought out later.
The afternoon session was devoted to
memorial addresses on departed mem
bers.
The evening session was of greatest pub
lic interest and wa3 largely attended.
Addresses of welcome were made by Gov
ernor F. M. Drake of lowa, Major John
Mac Vicar of Dcs Moines, Rev. H. O.
Breeden and Mrs. Mattie Locke Macomber
for the woman's dubs of Dcs Moines, and
Mrs. Adelaide Ballard of Hull for the
lowa Federation of Woman's Clubs.
Susan B. Anthony responded with an
address in which she expressed confidence
in the immediate future of the movement
and especially in the outlook in lowa.
The leading address of the evening was
by Carrie Lane Chapman Catt of New
York, which closed the programme. She
spoke of the future of the movement.
THE BLIZZARD STILL BLOWS.

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 27.â Therfc was an
appreciable moderation of the temperature
in Chicago to-day, but zero weather and
below was the best that could be had, and
the same is promised for to-morrow.
The record for continuous temperature
below zero for this city was broken to-day
by a run of eighty-four consecutive hours
from 1 a. M. January 24 to 1 p. m. to-day,
at which hour the zero mark was officially
recorded on the Auditorium tower.
During the previoas twelvo hours of the
day the thermometer had ranged between
4 deg. and 1 dep;. below zero. At 2 o'clock
this afternoon 1 deg. above zero was re
corded, and the same temperature con
tinued for three hours; tnen zero weather
and below returned, with the prospect of
colder weather to-morrow.
Snow fell lightly all day and into the
night, being driven by a wind, v hich
made the fine snow a source of great dis
comfort.
The drifts caused the snowpjows and
street-cleaning wagons to reappear. The
police continued their effective work of
providing instant temporary relief to ttie
thousands in want. Twice as many cases
were attended to as yesterday, the total
number of persons given food, clothing
and fuel Deing estimated at 10,000.
The letter-carriers are aidihg the police
in finding' the deserving ca?es in their
districts. The Mayor's fund now amounts
to $50 000 including the value of supplies.
About $30,000 cash has bean received by
the treasurer alone.
Many thousand dollars have been given
in the last three days for distribution,
apart from the Mayor's police relief
scheme, a result of his proclamation.
JACKbONVILLE. Fla., Jan. 27.â At 9
o'clock to-night the mercury bad fallen to
29 degrees in Jacksonville, with a west
wind and a barometer of 30.12.
This indicates that North Florida will
experience a freeze. As the tracking in
terest" of the northern portion of the State
are meager no great damage is expected.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Jan. 27.â There is but
s ieht relief to-day from the cold wave.
At 10 o'clock this morning the thermom
eter was 4 degrees above zero. The rail
roads are beginning to suffer from the
stoTm. Nearly all trains are now arriving
from one to ten hours late. It is estima
ted that 30,000 persons are destitute in this
city.
DENIBON, Tex., Jan. 27.â .Prominent
stockmen in Indian Territory and the
Panhandle report that the recem blizzard
has resulted in ihe death of thousands of
cattle on the range. It is.the first time in
years that the large watercourses were
frozen over.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 27.â *' or several
days the mercury baa been from 10 to 15
degrees below zero throughout Nebraska.
There are 500,000 sheep being fed in Ne
baska at present, and many have been
lost from severe cold.
YANKTON. S. Dak., Jan. 27 âReports
are meager Irom the caf.le ranges of this
State. The losses along the Missouri,
River will be heavy. The weather in that|
section has ranged from zero to 36 be lo^
ever since Friday. The snow is the deep
est for many years, and the cattle are able
to tind grass only in such exposed places
as the ground has been blown bare of
â¢snow. Worse still, the rivers are froeen
solid.

A Million Hollar* Tm*& for Atlantic Citff
â Oinatter Claim*.
CAMDEN, N. J., Jan. 27 âThat a rail
road collision is cosily as well as disas
trous has been demonstrated by the
amount of money which the railroads, the
West Jersey and the Philadelphia and
Reading have paid out as a consequence of
the Atlantic City disaster, when forty-four
persons were killed and a larger number
injured last summer. It has cost the
roads thus far nearly $1,000,000 to settle
claims for damages and all the cases have
not been settled yet.
The accident was caused by a Reading
flyer crashing into the West Jersey excur
sion, on which were-the Order of Red Men
returning from a day's outing at the sea
shore.-
One of the latest claims to be settled is
that of Mrs. Samuel Mita of Bridgeton.
Sue brought suit ior $90,000 for the killing
of her husband and daughter and the in
jury to herself and son. The road has
settled with her and the amount is said to
have been $30,000.

Saved From the Waves

Hands.
Rough Experience of the Crew
of the Steamer Elsa From
New Orleans.
After Many Trying Ordeals They
Finally Reach New York and
Proceed to Their Homes.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 27.â Delbert
A. Cleveland of Norwalk, Ohio, arrived at
Quarantine on Monday on the steamship
Seguranca, having been sent from Havana
by Consul-General Fitzhugh Lee. He
and eight companions of the wrecked
propeller Elsa were released yesterday
and will proceed at once to their nomes,
Mr. Cleveland tola his story as follows:
The steamer Elsa, of which I was third
owner, was going from New Orleans to Bocas
del Toro, when she ran on the Colorado reef,
on the northwest coast of the province of
MnardelÃio, on the evening of Januarys.
In five minutes the ship was under water.
We had Darely time to taite to the boats, and
did not succeed in saving anything but the
clothes we stood in. The boats were soon
Separated in the dark. We got through the
reef and fought a rough sea for six hours. In
the morning we sighted shore and reached it
that night. Here we found our companions.
We were completely exhausted, and after
buildings fire and eating a very scanty meal
we lay down and slept soundly.
Next morning we took to the boats again
and proceeded in a westerly direction. Be
fore noon we saw the smoke of a steamship,
which was coming directly for us. We were
not much cheered to see that it, was a
Spanish gunboat, the Aguila. We imme
diately had visions of a sojourn in Moro
Castle and other horrors, but we found that
the commander, Eueenio Montero, was a
gentleman in every sense of the word.
The moment our situation was explained
to him he ordered that each of us should re
ceive a drink of whisky and a good meal. To
fulfill the letter of his duty he dispatched a
boat's crew to look around and see if we had
landed any arms or ammunition on the island.
After satisfying himself in this respect, Cap
tain Montero got under way again aiid carried
us to the eastward. He took us to the port of
Mantua ani reported to General Francisco
Aregonez, the commander of the place.
When the commander of Arroya heard our
story he went on board and took myself and
another back to the wreck of the Elsaâ even
then under the suspicion that we were filibus
ters. After beating around the reef for some
three hours the Elsa was finally located. The
warship sent a small sailboat and some sea
men, the commander and ourselves to search
the wreCk. We found that sne had settled a
little there in the water and had the appear-
aiice of beginning to break up. Everything of
value was put on the sailboat. As nothing of
a suspicious nature was found on us we were
tak-en back to Arroya.
We stayed there two days as virtual Drlaon
ers, not being allowed outside the guard
lines. We were kept in an empty warehouse
and had very plain food. The town had been
partially fortified. There was a deep trench
â¢bout the place and nobody ventured outside
for ftfar of the insurgents. The towu was in a
miserable condition. The inhabitants were
dying off like rats in their homes of starva
tion and fever. Pea soup and fish were the
only things they had to eat. There was abso
lutely no trade of any sort going on. We were
told that we could not take our boats any fur
ther and that we would have to go overland
to Havana.
Early one morning we were ordered out.
We took packs on our backs and with an es
cort of about thirty soldiers started for the in
terior. As tve tramped on patiently toward
Mantua we could sco great volumes of smoke
to the east, which the soldiers informed us
was from villages Vhich had .been burned by
the insurrectionists. We saw the glare of theÂ«e
fires when we stopped cur march for the
night. Our guard became larger as we ad
vanced?
Uniforms? The troops have none; they wear
any sort of coat, no underwear and canvas
shoes. There was a regular collection of hats
in our guard. The only uniformity was a
little red button worn on the hats and the
blanket carried by each man. The food of the
company consisted of pea soup and bea bis
cuits. Meat ? There was none. There was
nothing but devastation to be seen on the
road.
At Mantua we were put up at the Hotel
Gran da. We slept that night in a vacant
shed with the rest of our crew and had the
ground for a bed and one blanket each fur a
cover. The next morning a courier with a
message arrived. The bugle was sounded and
within half an hour about 150 horsemen and
800 soldiers rrere on their way to the south,
where we could see smoke and hear a lot of
firing. 1 did not hear the result of the en
gagement.
We left that day for Bsja. We found this
place in the same miserable condition as the
others. Some of the soldiers we met threat
ened us, but our own guards were very civil.
From Baja we were escorted to Pinar del Rio,
where we interviewed another general. We
were now in the heart of the richest tobacco
country in the world. There is a railroad run
ning through it. We noticed that the earn
were made in the United States. The loco
motives were of the Baldwin male. Tnis road
is not doing any business to speak of, for the
insurgent* tear up the track and wreck the
traluÃ about as fast as the Spaniards can make
repairs.
From here we started on a long journey
toward the east-northeast, passing through
what was once a beautiful farming country,
but now it is all desolation. At Vihales we
purchased shoes and some food. The diet of
eea biscuits, beans and pea soup was beginning
to tell on us. We had not tasted any beef for
some days. The native troops have great
vitality. â¢ They do service on almost no food
and with rags to cover them. So yellow and
miserable is their appearance that one of our
seamen said that he could lick three of them
at a time easily.
Most of the.^e poor devils look as if they were
Buffering from jaundice, and their bones
stick out of their cheeks. They are covered
with vermin. They are armed for tne most
pert with old-fashioned Remingtous.
When we got well inland, we found that all
the young men were gone. There were old
men, women and children to be seen. Ail of
â  them looked ill. Bridges were down every
â¢ where, and we had to lord some of the rivers
with the water up to our waists. Only the
chimneys of the sugar-houses were standing.
The condition oi the Spanish officers in the
field is not as bad as that of the men. They
haye uniforms and manag3 to get provisions
for themselves and their horses. Those of
them that we met treated us well.
â  At a town called Consolacion the soldiers
got boisterous, and we were afraid they were
going to attack us. They did much loud talk
ing, shaking their fists and pointing their
suns at us, but the trouble was finally settled
. iv peace, and we were allowed to proceed.
We had now been joined Dy many other
soldiers and had quite a big escort. Mo>t of
them, however, were either wounded or unfit
ior duty, owing to sickness.
We arrived one morning at Rio Blanco, a
fine town only a couple of miles from the
coast. Here we were told that withi:i a few
days we wou.d get a steamship irom Havana.
We were very glad to hear it, for we were ut
terly tired out.
We had been here only s short time when
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
smoke waR seen. This was announced to be
onr steamship. She came within half a mile
of the coast. We were rowed out in large
lighters and put on board, together with the
sick and wounded soldiers. There was already
a big cargo of wounded on board. The sights
I saw on that ship I shall never forget. How
ever, you soon get accustomed to such things.
The'steamer made but oae stop between Rio
Blanco and Havana, and that was at Bahia
Honda More sick and wounded sqldters were
crowded oq here and a considerable amount
of corn and supplies was landed. Ihe condi
tion of tne sick and wounded might have been
toeiped had there been medicines, but there
was none at all.
At Bahia Honda we weighed anchor at 2:30
p. m., passed outside the reef and shaped a
course tor Havana, which we reached Sunday
morning, January 17. The Morro Castie and
forts were saluted as we passed inside the har
bor and we were in the Cuban metropolis. The
three guns and our bill of lading were sent on
board a Spanish gunboat which lay in the
harbor, and we waited in great anxiety to hear
our fate. After some time a guard came back
from the gunboat and we were escorted to a
cheap hotel, and now had a chance to wash
ourselves and eat a good, hearty meal.
The following-day, much to our surprise and
gratification, we were presented to the Ameri
can Consul, General Kiizhugh Lee, from whom
we received the treatment of shipwrecked
mariners. We had contracted quite a large
bill for our expenses while being brought here,
and our compass and instruments were taken
from us to be sold to meet ihese expenses.
Some olour boys were badly in need of cloth
ing, what they had being much torn and worn
out by the long hard trip across the island,
and Uncle Sam now supplied them with over
alls and some very thin cheap garments to
wear back to the States In zero weather, and
furnishtd us with steerage tickets, which
obliged us to sleep on the decks without bed
ding or blankets/ and to eat our mealioffihe
deck out of tin pans. Our treatment at the
hands of the Spaniards, whom we looked upon
as enemies, had been a good deal better.
There was a contrast in the case of the Nor
wegian sailors on board who were being sent
home by tneir Consul, and who also n ad been
shipwrecked. They were the crew of a bart
that had gone ashore near Vera Cruz, Mexico,
where the Norwegian Consul had provided all
with good, warm clothing aud a second-ciass
passage, and first-class passage lor the captain
and mate. So the Norwegians did not return
to their homes like tramps. We reflected upon
the poverty of Uncle Sam, who could do no
better than send his sailors home in the dead
of winter with no underclothing, and with
only the thinnest, apparel and very little of
that.
FR OM m E st.tT OF WA R.
Paaaenger* of the Olivette Bring a
Budget of Interesting A>wÂ«.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 27.â Passengers
on the Olivette report that Gonzales
Moreno, one of the most prominent citi
zens of Puerto Principe, for ten years
Mayor of the city and a rebel colonel in
the last war, nas joined tbe insurgeuts, as
has also Venanci Sorenz, a Spaniard, com
manding a detachment of troops in San
tiago de Cuba.
An expedition is said to have landed at
La Caleta, near Cape May si. It is also
reported that Ruiz Riveira gave a severe
thrashing to General Melguizo near Pi
nales and inflicted heavy losses, the
Spaniards losing thirty dead and eighty
wounded.
It is reported that when Weyler was
marching down CandelaHill, near Guines,
six shots were tired on him by some party
nidden in the bushes near by, injuring a
lieutenant and a private at his side.
On the 16th inst., passing by the town
of Malpaez, six miles southeast of Sague,
General Carreras ordered it burned, and at
the same time he carried off a number of
peaceful citizens and had them hacked to
pieces with machetes.
The guerrilla chief brought into Sugua
the dead bodies of four paciricos, one a
poor cripple, oue IS years old and three
children. This and other distressing facts
are given by a member of Uarrera's guerril
las.
The same authority says he saw over
twenty families trudging in Sagua la
Grande, driven from Malpaez. Some of
the women and children were virtually
nude. He also learned from a Spanish
officer that Gomez's infantry was camped
on the Manajanabo plantation, which is
betweeu Santa Clara and Camajunia. He
also informed the same party that there
was no doubt that Gomez had received a
big expedition at some point along the
Sagua coast.
FOURTEEN GIRLS MURDERED.
Bodiet Found in a Care, Where Dog*
Were Gnatclng lheir Bone:
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 27.-A Kfy
West, Fla., special says: The bodies of
fourteen girls have been found in a small
cave within half a mile of the Spanish
encampment at Guanabacoa on a road
visitors are not allowed to travel. They
were discovered by a boy who saw some
dogs gnawing bones.
Driving the dogs off be saw that they
were human bones, and noticing from
which direction they had been dragged he
came to this opening, and venturing in
saw the decomposing bodies.
The bodies could not be identified fur
ther than that they were female bodies
and young. The girls had been cruelly
murdered and some had been hacked in
pieces.
The publicity given to the many mur
ders committed at Guanabacoa hat
alarmed even the Spanish residents, who
fear the effect on the American people.
After the discovery of the girls' bodies a
large delegation of Spanish merchants and
business men called upon the Marquis de
Ahumada, the acting captain-general, and
made strong protestations to him upon
the subject.
He promised, it is said, though reluct
antly, to speak to General Weyler about it.
The patrol killed two boatmen Tuesday
night without warning as they ap
proached tnn quay, and threw them into
the water. One of the few remaining con
vents was entered by soldiers last Satur
day, and but for the interposition of tbe
authorities the inmates would have been
maltreated.
DRAFT OF A HOME-RULE I, AW.
What Spain JÂ» Said to Be Willing to
Concede to Cuba.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 28.â A dis
patch from the Herald's correspondent in
Havana, sent via Key West, says:
"I have seen absolute drafts of the home
rule law which Spain is to concede to
Cuba. The act provides for a legislative
assembly, wholly selective by an enlarged
suffrage and composed of a Senate
and Lower House. Besides hav
ine tfie sole powar to vote an
especial budget of the island,
this chamber has full power to draw up
and control the budget of what may be
termed the imperial expense?, or tbe ex
penses of tbe army and navy of Spain,
and so far as they are legitimately tc be
nhared by Cuba. This budget of material
expenses will be sent to Madrid for the
approval of tbe Cortes.
"With the Governor-General is vested
the power to appoint all officials in the
Cuban Government with the exception of
tbe directors-general, or collectors of the
ports and secretaries-general of the Gover
nor-ceneral and civil Governors of tbe
provinces, who are to be selected by popu
lar vote.
"Ail of those who shall be appointed by
the Governor-General must be confirmed
by the Assembly created by the reform
measure in the same way that Federal
appointments require confirmation by the
Senate in the United States.
"This Cuban Assembly will have full
and exclusive power to initiate all money
and tariff bills, and no bills of this nature
can be presented or considered by the
Madrid Government until they have been
approved by the Cuban Assembly.
"The reform measure was read to-Mr.
Olney in Washington last December by
Minister de Lome, and met his unquali
fied approval.
"Liberal as the concessions seem I do
not believe that the Cubans will accept
any reforms to which the United States is
directly or indirectly not a party. The
gurantee of reform is now sought in the
commercial agreement now being nego
tiated at Washington.
"In this agreement Spain clearly recog
nizes the new autonomous system in Cuba
and any failure to carry out the agree
ment now or to abrogate it in the future
would be a breach of faith with the United
States sufficient to justify remonstrance,
and eventually, if necessary, actual inter
ference. If the terms of this pledge given
by Spain to the United States are suffi
ciently explicit and unmistakable under
this indirect guarantee the Cubans will
accept the reform bill.
"I can say that I have the authority to
give this assurance, otherwise neither this
nor any other agreement, however made,
would be accepted. This has been said to
me many times during the last few days
by the most authoritative leaders in the
civil councils of the insurgents, and may
be regarded as final."
UOVEMEXiS OF GOMEZ.
The Whole Inland Watching thÂ« Innur-
qmt Chieftain.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 27.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: It
is reported in this city that General Go
mez is in the province of Matanzas. The
wnoie attention of the island is now cen
tered on Gomez, nltbougn it is always
difficult to tell with certainty the where
abouts of the Cuban leader. Gomez never
permits his position to be exactly known
until he strikes one of his unexpected
blows. But that he has passed the
boundary of Santa Clara province ap
pears quite certain.
Forty more persons were arrested Mon
day and sent to the common jail on politi
cal charges. Weyler's policy of terror and
persecution is producing the natural effect
of augmenting tbe insurgent forces, and at
tbe same time is stimulating the universal
dissatisfaction and tbe purpose to resist
Spain to the very end. It is said that Major
Fondiviella will soon be promoted to
the rank of colonel. The truth is that
Weyler has offered him a reward for his
recent massacres. Weyler is an intimate
friend of Fondiviella and brought him to
the island as one of tbe men in whom he
has the greatest confidence. He served
under Weyler in the Canary Islands. The
news of his promotion for the savage
butcheries which have made him famous
is, tberetore, not at all extraordinary.
There is no truth in the report, originat
ing in Key West, that the blowine-up of
the gunboat Cometa will result in a duel
between General Weyler and Admiral
Navarro.
Nevertheless, as has already been re
ported, there is bitter feeling and much
rivalry and jealousy between the navy and
the army. Admiral Navarro and Weyler
have exchanged angry notes about s*v
eral matters, and this duel has been going
on for a long time, but pens, ink and paper
are the only weapons used.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 27.âCom
mander Colby of the cruiser Newark re
ports to the Navy Department that on
January 23 he stopped the launch Undine,
which acted mysteriously.
The vessel came out of St. Johns har
bor, and he ordered a shot to be tired

Under these circumstances Commodore

HOUSE DISCUSSION
ON IMMIGRATION
Eloquent Pleas for Protec
tion of the American
Workingman.
Tariff Legislation of No Avail
if the Influx of Pauper
Lsbor Continues.
Hepburn of lowa Luily Cheered by
the Gal?riesâ Conference Report
' on tie Bill Adopted.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 27.â The
House to-day, alter tbe reading of the
journal, entered upon the consideration
of the immigration bill, as agreed upon
by tbe conferees of the House and Senate.
Bartholdt (R.) of Missouri, chairman oi
the House Committee on Immigration,
refused to sign the report. It was agreed
that the debate should continue until 4:15
o'clock to-day and that members should
have tne right to print.
Danford (R.) of Otiio opened the debate
in the presence of a large number of
members but an unusually small attend
ance in the galleries. He explained
the changes made in conference and
answered the objections made to the
separation of an illiterate husband
and his wife. He admitted that his bill
was drawn for the purpose of excluding
undesirable immigrants and that the edu
cational test was inserted in order to carry
out that purpose. The time had come, he
said, wnen something should bo done to
restrict immigration.
Time and again the conventions of the
two great parties had promised the coun
try relief on this score, but this was the
first real effort to make good these
promises.
He read from statistical returns of the
Superintendent of Immigration to show
the large proportion of illiterates coming
to the United States from the southern
and eastern portions of Europe, asserting
that the immigration from the western
and northern nations of Europe wouldbe
but little affected by the proposed legisla
tion.
A significant statement had been made
In the newspapers recently to the effect
that if every industrial wheel in the
country was started and the mills fully
manned there would bi two or three hun
dred thousand men still unemployed.
He did not speak for the ''Weary Wat
kins" who did not want to wort at any
time, but for those who want to labor and
who were pleading for legislation for their
protection.
The provisions of the bill known as Cor
liss' amendments, and intended to deal
with that class known as birds
of passage, Mr. Danford said, would
doubtless be found difficult to en
forceâmore difficult, probably, than was
imagined â but that something must be
done to prevent the forays of these people
who come in the summer and flee in the
winter was eenerally conceded.
Dolliver (R.) of lowa asked what was
the purpose of departing from the educa
t onal test fixed by the House and Senate
bill, and providing that the immigrant
should read and write the constitution of
the United States in the language of his
native or resident country.
Danford replied that it was to reach the
Russian Jews, who, being driven from
their homes and having drained the
charity of Western Europe, were being
thrown upon our shores in great numbers.
For the first time in their history the
Hebrew Associated Charities of New York
were compelled to appeal for aid to people
outside their own race for the relief of
their people in t. at city.
He concluded with an earnest plea for
the passage of the bill.which would in some
small degree relieve the country from the
menace to which it is exposed under
present laws. He did not as-k that ward
ship be worked to any one, but that the
interests of the residents of the country
might be conserved.
In opening the debate in opposition to
the adoption of the report, Bartholdt said
he bad refused to sign the report
for two reasons â first, that by
its provisions families â husbands and
wives, mothers and children â would be
separated, and second, that it forbade the
entrance of immigrants who could not
read the language of their native or
adopted country.
This drastic provision, be said, was not
contained in either the Senate or House
bill, and its appearance vindicated his ex
iiressed fear some weeks ago that if the
bill went to conference it would return in
a shane which could not be justified to
the constituents of many Representatives
am* would offend the sense of justice and
right of the country.
TThe bill, Bartholdt asserted, would de
feat the purpose nominally ureed by its
advocates, of establishing an educational
test. It would shut out, for instance, a
class of Germans who had for 3QO yenrs
made their homes in Russia, the language
of which they did not speak; also many
of the residents of Alsace-Lorraine who
had not yet acquired the German lan
guage.
To Hitt (R.) of Illinois, who inquired as
to the status of the Swiss, who had no
distinctive national language, would they
be shut out according to the gentleman's
construction ot the law, Bartholdt said
three languages had obtained recognition
in Switzerland, and immigrants from that
country would choose among them.
Many members interroeated Bartboldt
with a view to demonstrating that the
language clause wonld not work such dis
advantage as he imagined. To all of
them he said his object was to perfect the
measure so as not to expose desirable im
migrants to the jeopardy involved in the
preseut form of tne bill.
Several suggestions were made as to the
best manner in which to secure this end,
but friends of the bill found none of them
acceptable.
Referring to the statement that the bill
was intended to reach especially the Rus
sian Jews, Bartholdt said :
"If ia thi3 dawn of the twentieth cen
tury my constituents should ask me to
join in jurther prosecuting them I would
lay down my duties here, return to my
sanctum and write editorials against such
an inhuman proposition." [Applause.]
C. W. Stone (R.)of Pennsylvania advo
cated the adoption of the conference re
port, saying that if it were not adopted
Congress would do nothing at this session
toward the restriction of immigrants.
Many members, be said, received tele
grams like the one he sent to the clerk's
desk, and had read from a steamboat
agency in Chicago requesting constituents
to wire their Congressmen to vote against
the immigration bill under threats that
an affirmative vote meant defeat for re
election.
The demand for the passage of the bill
bad been made by the National â¢Conven
tions of the Republican and Democratic
parties, and, further, the immigration of
recent years entered into disastrous com
petition with the workingmen of the
country, forcine *.hem to either take low
wages or to abandon their labors alto
set her.
If the test proposed in the law had been
in effect the past year it would have kept
out 68.163 immigrants from Russia, Italy
and Austro-Hungary, from which coun
tries generally the undesirable class came,
while only 4146 would have been returned
to Germany, Sweden and Norway, Eng
land and Ireland, which furnished the de
sirable immigrants.
Speaking of the distribution of the im
migrants Stone said that of the 343,000
who came in last year 224,650 remained in
the States of Massachusetts, New York
and Pennsylvania.
"It is no wonder," be said, jrfch great
earnestness, "that the gentleman from
Missouri (Barthol-it) and otner Western
Representatives oppose Uie passage oi an
immigration bill, because it does not
trouble them.
In the name of his State Stone de
manded some restriction. It was useless
to pass tariff laws mtenaed to benefit the
workingmen of the country unless they
were protected against the invasion of
pauper labor from abroad. [Applause. |
Tne adoption of the conierence report
was antagonized by Buck (D.) of Louis
iana. In eloquent words and impressive
manner* he spoke of the benefits to Amer
ica from immigration which were too often
forgotten or unappreciated.
Johnson (R. ) of Indiana followed in
favor of the conference report. Tne bill
proposed, he saiu, did not co far enough.
He wished one broad and drastic enough
to meet the evil which the legislation wag
intended to meet.
There were many immigrants who could
read and write who were otherwise totally
unfit to become American citizens. Any
law short of absolute restriction of immi
gration must necessarily be arbitrary in its
â¢effects. Gentlemen might quote scripture,
might go back to ancient history and
make beautiful speeches about the hu
manities; but the practical fact was that
the time Had come when American
civilization was in danger from the in
novation of foreign hordes upon our
shores to deteriorate the blood.
Parker (R.) of New Jersey objected to
the report of the conference committee for
the reason that it went further than the
provisions of either the House or Senate,
and that was beyond the purview of such
a body.
Corljis (R.) of Michigan explained the
necessiti"S of the provisions in tbe bill
suggested by himself, aimed at what are
known as "birds of passage."
In Detroit alone, lie said, there were
10,000 citizens anxious to work, unable to
obtain it because of the presence of aliens
who were there temporarily, defrauding
the American citizens out of their rights.
When be took bis oath of office as a
member of the House, it wus not to legis
late for the benefit of the whole world, but
for the upbuilding and protection of the
American people. [Applause. J
Walker (R.) of Massachusetts said that
nothing in nis experience as a member of
Congress had made his blood boil as had
this conference report.
The nihilist, socialist and anarchist
could easily pass the educational teat and
come in. It would be better lo admit
some cf the nonest farmers and working
men who could not read.
While I annon (R.) of Illinois had voted
to exclude the Chinese, alien-contract
labor and paupers and favored the impo
sition of the educational test provided in
the House bill, he could not support the
conference report because it was ambigu
ous. If it was desirable to shut out cei
tain classes of people, shut them out
directly and not in an indirect manner.
Morae (R. ) of Massachusetts said his
colleague (Walker) did not represent the
sentiment of Massachusetts on the sub
ject; it demanded restricted immigration,
and the pending bill met that demand.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio would not vote
for a bill that permitted a man to aban
don his wife and bring in his pauper rela
tives.
He would not vote for a measure framed
specially to restrict the entrance of the
Russian Jews, for such a vote would be
charged up to him as a vote against a man
on account of his religion.
And ne would not vote for the provision
when opened the door to immigrants of
any class, pauper, criminal or insane, r>ro
yided only that they had resided for a time
in Cuba.
Danford (R.) of Ohioâ That is to last
only as long as the revolution lasts.
Grosvenor â Well, that may be a long
time, if the revolution-continues as long
as the last one did.
Dolliver (R. ) of lowa antagonized the
report, expressing the opinion thai it was
vastly more important for a man to enjoy
the society of bis wife than cf his grand
father, which the bill provided.
It also contained a provision for free im
migration from Cuba. This was intended
to bring a thrill of joy into the insurgent
camps in Cuba, to be. informed that after
two years of consideration and a variety
of legislation the great American republic
had decided to admit Cubans into this
country without undergoing a civil service
examination. (Laughter).
fioatner (D.) of Louisiana spoke for and
Taylor (R.) of Ohio against the report,
and the debate was concluded by Hep
burn (R.) of lowa in favor of the confer
ence report.
In concluding his remarks Mr. Hepburn
drew an eloquent and effective picture of
the American workingman as a citizen
without work, searching for it and re
turning home unsuccessful.
"What lullaby," he asked, "will that
man sing to his hungry child at nizht to
sa'isfyits cravings? That man has the
ballot, and, knowing what your knowl
edge must be of his action, I ask if it is
not the part of patriotism and statesman
ship to provide for him?"
He expressed the belief that even on
this inclement day there were 250,000
American citizens unable to obtain work â
turned out of their places to make room
for those from foreign lands.
"You talk of dividing the bounties of
this great republic with the people of the
whole world. Let us serve our own first:
let us keep the places for American labor
ers to delve in, and then if we have to
spare we can invite those of other na
tions." [Loud applause, in which the gal
leries enthusiastically joined. J
The vote was then taken on the adoption
of the conference report, and on a division
it was agreed toâ ll6 to 105.
Bartholdt demanded the ayes and noes,
which resulted in 131 ayes and 117 noes.
The usual motion to reconsider and lay
that motion on the table having been
made by Danford (R.) of Ohio and agreed
to, the House at 4:45 adjourned until to
morrow. .
FORECLOSURE NOT NECESSARY.
Eminent Lamer So/s the Union Pacific
Has A/ready Forfeited /is
Charter.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 27.â There
is not the slightest chence that the Harri
son-Gear bill for a Pacific Railroad com
mission can become a law. The question
then recurs as to proceedings in court.
The Call correspondent was informed
to-ni>>ht by an eminent and able lawyer
who expects to take part in this suit that
foreclosure proceedings in the case of the
Union Pacific will not bs necessary, as it
was expressly stipulated in the act of 1878
that six months after the roads, or either
of them, had defaulted, they, or either of
them, should forfeit their charter and all
rights whatsoever granted.
This attorney, who understands Pacific
Railway affairs thoroughly and who is
considered one of the ablest corporation
lawyers in the United States, contends
that foreclosure proceed lncs are unneces
sary in the case of the Union iPacific, as
that company has been in default for four
teen months, and all of its rights granted
by the act of 1878 are therefore forfeited.
Foreclosure Bill Sited.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 27. â The
Government bill for foreclosure of its
mortgage on tÂ»e Union Pacific Railroad
Company was filed in the United States
Circuit Court here to-day. The amount
of the mortgage Is $27,236,512, and the
overdue interest $29,6b4,tkiti 39.

West Point Cadets at the
Inauguration Is the!
Subject.
Allen's Keen Thrusts at the
Delaware Senator Returned
With Interest
The Nicaraguan Canal Bill Elicits
Warm Debate, but No Action
Is Taken.
WASHINGTON. D. C., Jan. 25.â 1n the
Senate to-day the MiiitaryAcademy appro
priation bill was taken up, the question
being on Proctor's amendment to pay the
transportation and subsistence of West
Point military cadets coming to Washing
ton to attend the inaugural parade. Proc
tor submitted a brief argument in support
of the amendment.
Gray (D.) of Delaware opposed the
amendment. The last inauguration
which the West Point cadets attended, he
said, was in 1872, and he understood that
at that time two of them lost their lives
inconsequence of exposure. He did not
feel that the time had come for bringing
the cadets of the Military Academy to
grace the inauguration ceremonies.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska expressed his
surprise (ironically) at the position taken
by Gray, who, he said, had given his sup
port to the Republican ticket in the recent
campaign. Why not, he asked sarcasti
cally, let the cadets come and see the con
summation of that great event.
Allen argued that to bring these carets
here would be a work of supererogation;
"not only that, but H is foolishnessâ ab-
solute, inexcusable foolishness. They are
not to be brought here for educational
purposes. This a mere excuse. They are
to come here to witness the display of the
assumption of the crown by the Presi
dent."
"The crown of thorns," Gray suggested.
"I should like to see the time come
back in this country," continued Allen,
"when a man would be inaugurated as
Jefferson was â in absolute democratic
simplicity.
"Riding up to the Capitol on a street
car," Gray put in.
"Yes, riding up on a streetcar," Allen
assented.
"That is good enough for any man ; or
on horseback, if he can ride; that is good
enough for any man."
The discussion was continued by Haw
ley (R.) of Connecticut and Thurston (R.)
of Nebraska, who favored the amendment,
and by Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire,
Hale (R.) of Maine, Stewart (Pop.) of Ne
vaaa, Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas and Cook
erill (D.) of Missouri, who opposed it.
The debate was closed by Hawley, who,
in reply to arguments In favor of sim
plicity, declared that there was "a great
deal ot rot in this world." He would not
say where it was located.
The vote was then taken and the amend
ment was rejected â ayes 20, noes 28. The
bill was then passed.
Senate bill to provide for further prov
ing the genuineness of handwriting in
United States courts was taken up, briefly
dist ussed and passed.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire pre
sented the memorial of Henry A. Dupont
of Delaware, claiming that there was an
error made in counting the vote in the
Senate on his claim for admission to the
Senate and asking that the question be re
opened. Referred to the Committee on
Privileges and Elections.
Tne Nicaragua canal bill was then taken
up, and Morgan (D. ) of Alabama, in
charge of the Dill, made an elaborate state
ment in reply to the claim that the cost of
the canal would far exceed tbe estimates
of the Canal Company.
Morgan asked unanimous consent to
have a vote taken on the bill and amend
ments at 3 o'clock next Friday, but objec
tion was made by Turpie (D.) of Indiana.
Morgan then gave notice that he would
ask the Senate to sit out the bill to
morrow.
Hale (R.) of Maine, while declaring
himself favorable to the Nicaragua Canal,
did not think that the Senate was more
likely to find itself in a domain o; ac
quiescence and consent for the enterprise
on the part ot the Central American
powers by asserting that there was an im
pertinent intrusion on their part or that
there . was any attempt at blacKmail, as
the Senator from Alabama had declared
the other day.
Sherman (It.) of Ohio said he believed
and still believed that the only way by
which the Nicaragua Canal could be con
structed was by the action and power of
the Government ot the United States.
The Frelingbuysen-Salva treaty was be
fore the Senate ten years ago. He sup
posed it would accomplish the purpose,
and he believed that if that treaty had
been ratified the canal would have been
completed at this tlrue.
Unfortunately, however, that treaty had
been withdrawn from the Senate. Prob
ably the Maritime Canal Company had
been too sanguine in its expectations.
At any rate, it was unable to borrow
money to go on with the work. It had
been compelled to seli bonds at usurious
rates and t he result was that the com pÂ«ny
had praciically failed and was unable to
complete the work.
"In my judgment," Sherman pro
ceeded, "that canal can never be built by
a corporation. It must be built, if at all,
by the people of the United States."
As to the criticism of Mr. Rodriguez

Sherman asserted that the right of that
Minister was as clear as the right of the
British Embassador, and that he should
be treated with kindness and forbearance.
His honorable friend (Morgan) had im
agined that Great Britain was back of the
Minister from Central America, but that
Senator was always apt to refer to Eng
land as a bugaboo. [Laughter.]
TLe Senate of the United States, he
added, does not fear England or any other
power. The people oi the United States
do not fear England. We have had two
wars with England, and I hope that we
will never have another.
The two nations ought never to right
with each other. They ought to be al
ways friendly. Great Britain is now more
and more following the example of the
United States in having a government "of
the people, by the people and for the peo
ple."
"And I believe," he continued, "that
the time is not far distant when Great
Britain will be as free as we are and will
approach nearer and nearer to the rule of
the people. But for the Irish question she
would be still nearer to it.' 1
Sherman went on to say that although
he should vote tor the bill in any form in
which it might be presented, he thought
the better way would be to allow the mat
ter to rest
The bill could not pass Congress during
the present session, as in all probability ii
passed by tho Senate it would not be
taken up in the House. He would not
take advantage of the misfortunes of the
company, but would pay back to it every
dollar that it had expended.
White (D.) of California asked Sherman
if the pending bill was not substantially
the same as he had reported to the Senate
some time ago as chairman of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, and on which
bill he had indulged in extended eulo
gistic comments.
Sherman admitted that it was, but
added that the company was not able to
build the canal.
White further asked whether it had not
been evident at that time that the con
struction of the canal would require the
assistance of the United States.
"Yes," Sherman replied, "and if the
United States had given that assistance
tne company woulu probably not have
failed."
Morsan objected to a statement by
Sherman that the Maritime Company had
gone to Congress to ask for assistance.
"Did I say bo?', Sherman asked.
"You said so," Morgan replied.
"I think we sought the company,"
Sherman corrected himself.
"Yes, we sought tbe company," said
Morgan, who went on to speak of Sher
man's allusion to thp negotiation of a new
treaty on the line of the Frelinghuysen-
Salva treaty.
Vilas(D.)of Wisconsin moved to com
mit the bill to the Committee on Foreign
Relations, and then suggested that if
Morgan preferred to have it recommiited
to the select committee on the Nicaragua
canal he would modify the motion.
"The chairman of the select committee,"
said Morgan in a haughty tone, "has
never any choice between insults."
Vilas disclaimed the idea of offense and
modified his motion.
Aldrich (R.) ot Rhode Island spoke
against the motion and in lavor of the
bill, referring to what lie called the prom
ise of Sherman â the future Premier â to
negotiate a new treaty,
"I did not say that," Sherman inter
posed.
"You said," Aldrich repeated, "that if
the bill were allowed to go over a new
treaty could be negotiated, but we have
no assurance that the States of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica will enter into any such
negotiations.
"The friends of the bill should under
stand that this recommittal means the
death-knell of the project which is so dear
to the hearts of the American people."
Without action on Vilas' motion to re
commit, the Senate, at 4:45 p. M., bjr a
vote of 28 to 27, adjourned until to
morrow.
DECLARED A DRAW.
Decision in the Stelzner- Van Buskirk
Contest Fails to Please the
Spectators.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 27.â Referee
Donahue declared the Van Buskirk-Stelz
ner ten-round contest a draw, and nearly
800 spectators declared Referee Donadue's
decision to be so odorous that ii required
immediate intermentâ and chere were not
over 820 spectators present.
They declared that Slelzner was robbed
of his hard-earned honors, but just the
same it was a great battle.
From start to finish it was seemingly
Stelzner's fight, he landing at will on his
opponent, closing one eye entirely and
greatly damaging the other, and pro
ducing a decidedly Hamburger steak ap
pearance to Van's iace.
Van Buskirk proved to be a glutton for
punishment. He kept following Stelzner
up in every round, at times attempting
hard swings with his right, some of which
landed, but the majority hit the atmos
phere.
In the first round Jack jabbed hid man
repeatedly in the face with his leit and
received several bard left swings in re
turn, honors being about even.
In the second Van cut the pace and
lauded several heavy right swings on
Jack's head and body, and received In re
turn left jabs which invariably landed on
his optic.
Van had the best of it Toward the end
of the third Stelzner punched Van all
over the rine, and in the fourth he re
peated tbe performance. At y tie end of
the round Van went to his corner with
one eye closed and his face covered with
blood.
The fifth and sixth rounds saw some
hard righting, with honors easy, but in
the seventh Jack again pounded Van and
tnd"d the round with a left swing that
nearly drove Van througd the rones.
The eighth was all Stelzner's. He
landed at will, Van taking his punish
ment without a murmur and r.ever mak
ing a lead. It ended with Van being a
little groggy.
In the ninth Van again failed to land a
blow on hia clever opponent, who jabbed
him repeatedly on his damaged face
In the final round Van started on the
aggressive, but his damaged eyes pre
vented liim from landing with any accu
racy, and the round ended witu Stelzner
hammering Van at will.4
DEAF MAN ON
A FRESNO JURY
Sanders' Cellmate Has Tell
ing Testimony to
Offer.
A Stubbcok's Cold Evidencs
Against the Accused Pro
fessor.
A Sensation Expected From the Ex
posure of an Alleged Manufac
tured Defense.
FRESNO, Cal.. Jan. 27.â 1n the trial of
W. A. Sanders for forgery John Reich
lnan, the expert on handwriting, was on
the stand during the greater part of the
day and was cross-examint d at length by
the defense.
The witness made practically the same
explanation of the characteristic* of
Wootton's genuine signature as Mr. Gum
pel did the day before, and pointed out
the differences in the signature to tlip
draft. Mr. Reichman was very positive
that the draft, deeds and letters were for
gerie?.
Deputy Sheriff Peck was placed upon
the stand. He had taken a leading part
in conducting the investigations wuicb led
to Professor Sanders' arrest. The mnin
point of his testimony was the rinding of
a draft book by himself and Detective A.
B. Lawson ir. tue delendant's office at Lis
ranch.
Tne book contained blank? precisely
like the one on which tho drait whicii
Sanders is alleged to have forged was
written. The officer found that one
blank had been torn out, together with
tho stub. Next to the binding the torn
edges couid be seen, however. Such
books always contain fifty blanks, and
the witness found, upon careful counting,
that there were only forty-nine in the
book.
Robert Anderson will ba called to-mor
row forenoon to testify regarding the
agreement he entered into with Professor
Sanders to assist in fabricating testimony
while they were cellmates in the County
Jail.
It is understood that he will tell every
thing in regard to the transaction, and the
manufactured statements which Sanders
wrote for the two witnesses Ander-on was
to procure will probably be introduced in
evidence and the sensational contents
made public.
There is room for serious doubt whether
one of the jurors is hearing all the tppti
monv introduced. His name is J. M. Rose
and he is an elderly man. His bearing is
imperfect â so much so that he can under
stand only when distinctly spoken to.
When Mr. Rose was examined as a
talesman the attorneys had to out their
questions in such a manner, and he stated
mat whenever he should be unable to hear
the testimony he wculd tell the witnesses
to speak louder.
While one witness was on the !>tand
early in the trial District Attorney Snow
asked the juror if he could hear what was
being said. "Most of it," was Mr. Rose's
reply, and he was informed that he ought
to understand everything.
Although Mr. ftose occapies a chair
near the witness-stand, it is doubtful that
he Hears all the testimony. The witnesses
sometimes eive tueir answers in an under
tone, making it difficult for a person even
with normal hearing to understand them.
This is a very important matter. The
attorneys aup court, being deeply occu
pied with tbe proceedings, forget that the
juror is partially deaf, and do not always
require the witness to speak out.
Mr. Rose probably thinks he catches the
answers, but it may be presumed at least
that this is a very unreliable manner of
presenting testimony to a jury.

Monterey Favort County Division.
MONTEREY, Cal., Jan. 27.â The sub
ject of dividing Monterey County, which
was broached some time ago and had
quieted down, is being again agitated arid
on a very firm basis. It is believed tnat
the combined efforts of this city and Pa
cific Grove, together with the residents
down the coast, will eventually result in
this county being divided. It 19 proposed
to form a new county out of the present
Fifth Supervisorial District. At a mass
meeting held here a few nights ago the
advocates of the project showed by facts
and fizures thai By the consolidation of
some of the county officers the govern
ment of the county could be carried on
with less taxation tuan is now beins; paid.
Monterey would be the county seat and
old Colton Hall is to be repaired and used
for a Courthouse.

Columbia tinhermr-n Mat/ Strike.
PORTLAND, Ob., Jan. 27.â The success
of the Alaska canners' combine has led
Columbia River canners to agitate the
scheme of a tinner organization than they
now enjoy. The only obstacle is the
Fishermen's Union, which is one of the
strongest organizations of its kind in
existence. As a result of last season's
strike the canners lost heavily. They
claim they will give only 4% cents a
pound the coming season, while the fisher
men demand 5 cent*. The probabilities
are that there will be another great strike
unless the canners give in.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
THE BISHOP SAYS
BOVARD IS RIGHT
Montgomery on the Tax
ing of Educational
Institutions.
The State Sffould at Least Re
frain From Taxing Pri
vate Schools.
Cla nu Government Excluded From
Is Prerogatives That of Teach
ing Religion.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Jan. 27.â Bishop
Montgomery contributes the following to
the discussion of the question of taxing
educational institutions in California,
which has been brought to public notice
anew by President Jordan of Stanford
University, Rev. B. F. Bovard of the M.
E. Church and others, through the col
umns of The Call. The prelate said:
I think Dr. Bovard is quite right. Presi
dent Jordan spoke simply for the Stanford
University, and Dr. Bovatd merely shows that
ail arguments used by the president are, on
every couit, far more telllug In favor of the
private schools and other institutions where
religion is taught.
For the most part private schools owe their
existence to a desire on tne part of certain pa
rents that religious training go hand in hand
with secular leaching, wnilst religious In
stuction is uot made an essential part of uni
versity training. Many, in fact most, of the
private schools and churches have been built
and are sustained, taxes included, with the
hard earnings of the poor p.nd middle classes.
It may be that the people have not yet
weighed sufficiently the arguments advanced
by Dr. Bovard, but they will come to adopt
them yet. *
The proposition is a very pimple one, it
seems to me. It is this: The Government is
nou-sectarian. It has no religion, and can
teach none as such, yet it depends upon re
ligion for its very life. Dr. Bovard might
have coutinued to quote from Washington in
these words: "Where is the security for life,
for property, for reputation, If the sense of re
ligious obligations deserts the oaths which
are the instruments of investigation in courts
of justice?"
The declaration of independence simply pro
claimed that we are by nature entitled to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and the
revolution was waged to make good that
declaration.
The constitution was formed to secure us
the fruit of tne revolution. And here is Wash
ington declaring that it can't do such thing
unless religion comes in as auxiliary. But the
Government wisely excluded from its preroga
tives that of teaching religion. Since, there
fore, it has committed itsulf to a non-reli
gious system it yet depends upon religions for
its own successful operation. What ought it
in common sense to do? At least favor the
private enterp ise of those who can and will
teach religion. How shall it favor and en
courage these pr vate enterprises? Why, at
least, by refraining irom taxing them.
1 his would seem a very cheap way of retting
that which is essential to its life, aud which
Washington tacily confesses it can get in no
other way. Oh, yes, I not only indorse Dr.
Bovard's views, bull am very glad to see that
a change of heart is coming over his denomi
nation, for, if I mistake not, his particular de
nomination worked hard to have that very
clause, taxing everything in sight, inserted in
our constitution.
NEW DANGER TO ORANGE-GROWERS
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Mem
orializes the Government Against
Mexican Fruit and a Worm.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 27.â The
orange-growers of California are threat
ened witn a calamity 10 which the peat of
the red and the while scale cannot be
compared in destruction.
The Federal Government was asked this
afternoon by the board of directors of the
Chamber of Commerce of this city to pro
hibit all importations of fruit from Mex
ico, on account of the danger of bringing
into California the Mexican orange worm
known to science as the Tryeta ludens.
The Horticultural Commissioners of Riv
erside have brought the pending danger to
the attention of the chamber in an ex
haustive report. From this it was learned
that the ludens is deposited in the orange
by the fly and the insect passes the larvae
and pupa stage in the fruit, emerging there
from a developed fly. The worms are said
to be disgusting creatures and make the
fruit offensive and useless.
It is pointed out that the chief danger
of infecting the groves of California is
through using fan tears that have been
employed in the Mexican orange trade.
The report states that most of that traffic
is bandied with the same cars that are
used by the growers of this State.
The only safety is in securing from the
Federal Government a prohibition of all
importations of fruit from Mexico, as long
as the ludens exist in that country. To
secure this measure all possible efforts
will be made.
The ravages of the white scale, which
threatened at one time to wipe out the
orange-groves of this part o- the State,
were as nothing compared to the. possible
damage the ludens would cause if it is
allowed to gain a firm foothold. As it is
shippers cannot be too careful in their use
of cars that may have bÂ»en employed in
traffic from Mexico. These, while being
cleaned at packing-houses, are very liable
to distribute the germs of the ludeus
among the finest orchards.
BARIUCLMA \ WILL 11 A Mi .

of Hit Wife.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 27.â J. Bar
thelman, who killed his wife last Dccc m
ber, was last evening found guilty of
murder in the first degree. His defense

the prisoner by the insanity plea, but to
no avail.

Prisoners.
WALLA WAL.LA, Wash., Jan. 27.âPar
ticulars of an attempt to escape from the
penitentiary were brought to this city

sixty-four feet distant. The dirt taken
out was thrown iuto a cavity under the ad
joining room. (
He had succeeded in tunneling forty feet
when discovered. A short-hancued shovel
was found in the tunnel, and a tramcar
improvised from jute, with long strings
attached, was used to carry the dirt awsy.
Harrison, who had also been in the hos
pital for three months, did janitor work,
and had the freeuom of tne yard. It was
Harrison's actions that caused the Deputy
Warden to suspect that something"TFas
wronÂ«. He was frequently sent on er
rands to the laundry, but never neglected
an opportunity to pick up a piece of
string. After being watched for three
days he was followed last night about
midnight, and the hole in the floor of
Casey's room and the excavation below
were discovered.

STAGGERED BACK
AND FELL DYING
Tragic Suicide of Attorney
Charles F. Wilcox of
San Jose.
Carbolic Acid, Lest Fortune and
Poor Health Were the
Causes.
Career of a Prominent Man Who
Lived in Santa Clara County
Nearly All His Lif>.
SAN JOSE, Cat.., Jan. 27.â Charles F.
Wilcox, a prominent attorney of this city,
committed suicide In his office in the Safe
Deposit building, corner of First and
Santa Clara streets, at 1:15 o'clock this
afternoon.
He took a large dose of carbolic acid.
After taking the poison he entered an ad
joining room where his brother, Harry E.
Wilcox, and Miss Dorsey, a typewriter,
were and said :
"Harry, I've taken carbolic acid."
He then staggered back into his office
and seated himself in the chair at his
desk, where he expired in about ten min
utes.
An alarm wa< given and several occu
pants of the building entered the room.
Dr. Seifert was telephoned for and every
thing possible done for the suffering man,
Charles F. Wilcox, the San Jose
Suicide*
but without avail. Tne tioÂ«e taken was
about four ounces. On a shelf in the room
was an eight-ounce bottle about half full
of carbolic acid. â¢
For i he past two years Mr. Wilcox has
been in ill health and at times was moody
and morose. He also suffered great finan
cial losses, and ihe-e matters preyed upon
his mind until it became weakened.
About ten years ago Mr. VVilcox's father
died, leaving him about $75,000. This
money was not well invested and he lost
it all. He hegan the erection of a mag
nificent residence in Alaroeda, but before
it was finished financial difficulties over
took him and it was turned over to
creditors.
Two weeks a o Mr. Wilcox disappeared
from his home, and at that time it was
thought he had wandered off and killed
nimself. A few days later tie was discov
ered in San Francisco and appeared to be
in a half-dazed condition. He would give
no explanation as to the cause of the trip
other than that tie wanted to rest. It is
said that this forenoon he vi-ited Oak
Hill Cemetery and wandered among the
graves.
Mr. Wiluox arrived at his office shortly
after noon to-day and busied nimself with
some papers, among which was a nolo

At the time of the failure of the Pacific
Bank in 1893 the Mendocino Bank had
$9410 27 on deposit at the Pacific Bank.
Wood held 212 shares of the bank stock,
and the Mendacino Bank, through Wads

share of the liability. The case was orig
inally brought in the Justice Court, where
Justice Dwyer gave judgment for the
plaintiff. The decision to-day was on an
appeal."

AMERICAN SBIITIMG.
Its Restoration I*iscu*.ied at the Manu
facturer*' Contention.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 27.â
convention of the National Association of
Manufacturers was late again this morn
ing in assembling for the day's session,
and it was after 11 o'clock beforo Presi
dent Search called the convention to
order. The first subject was the discus
sion of President Search's report. On
that part of the report under the head
"The Restoration of American Shipping,"
A. It. Smith of New York challenged the
statement that the decline of our shipping
is due to the protection of our other in
dustries at the expense of our shipping
trade. Mr. Smith contended that, the
protective tariff imposed on imports has
turned the attention of the people to the
development of our internal affairs to the
neglect of the extension of our shipping
interests.
Mr. Smith's exception led to quite a dis
cussion; his views were sustained and en
larged upon by other members.
A resolution was introduced that Presi
dent S arch appoint a special committee
to consider anil report upon the best way
to restore the American flag on the high
sens. The resolution w:;s adopted.
Quite a discussion followed a proposition
to change the reading of the president's
report, but the opposition was so pro
nounced tbatth" motion was withdrawn
SUICIDE BEFORE POVERTY.
Abigail K. Perrlne Ends Her Life in
the Layâ She Was De
spondent.
Abigail E. Perrine of 1212 West street,
Oakland, committed suicide early on Tues
day morning by jumping in the bay off
the Clay-street wharf. Her body was re
covered by two of the sweepers employed
by the Harbor Commissioners.
About 12 o'clock Monday night the
woman was noticed by the engineer of the
tug Willie. She was standing near the
float of the Clay-street wharf and was act
ing in a peculiar way. That was about
the last seen of thf> woman alive. When
the steamer Dauntless arrived from Stock
ton at 8 o'clock yesterday morninp the
action of her wheel caused the body of the
woman to rise :rom the water.
George H. Armes and C. M. Armes of
West Oakland called at the Morgue yes
terday and identified the body as that of
Abigail E. Perrine, who was housekeeper
for her brother at 1212 West street, Oak
land.
It was learned that the woman was de
spondent because her brother was out of
employment, and had often threatened
suicide.
OAKLAND. Cal., Jan. 26.â Miss Abigail
E. Perrine was a highly respected and
devout member of the First Baptist
Church of this city. She left home yes
terday about 2:30 o'clock and went to
the City, where she was met at the ferry by
George H. Armes, a neighbor and old
time friend. He asked her what she was
doing in San Francisco at that hour of
the day.
"I have important business," she said,
and passed on without stopping.
Deceased was one of turee maiden sis
ters, the others being Miss Frances and
Miss Susan, engaged in the dressmaking
business. They have been residents of
the city for twenty-five years or more.
About ten years ago tieir only brother,
then living in Kansas, lost his wife, leav
ing a family of three boys and two girls,
the youngest a baby two weeks old. The
sisters decided to rear the children aiid
Aliss Abbie went after them. Since then
they cared for these children and gave
them a good education.
About six years ago the oldest boy went
north with Harold Bolce and settled in
Spokane, where he now lives. The
youngest boy died of consumption last
December. Misa Perrine worried over him
a great deal and the friends of the family
fear that she temporarily lost ncr reason
and dnring that time took her life.
The Rev. Charles H. Hobart, pastor of
the church, was aware that she was in
mental trouble. "She came to me as her
pastor," said he to-day, "and said she had
been worried a great deal of late over
Leon's illness. She was a beautiful char
acter, and if she had bean in her right
mind self-destruction would have been the
farthest from her mind. She was retiring
in her disposition, but a most devout
Christian, and lam confident she took her
life in a fit of temporary insanity."
HEFNING KOSTEB'S WILL.
Valuable Estate Bequeathed to the
Family of the â¢ estator.
The will of Henning Koster, who died
in Markoldtndorf, amt Einbeck, Han
ovÂ«r, Germany, on the 11th oflast August,
has been filed foj^probate. Property in
this City belonging to the estate is valued
at $43,000. The entire estate is bequeathed
to the family of the deceased.
Tne manner in which wills are executed
in Germany is illustrated by the trans*
lated copy presented yesterday. The in
troductory paragraph reads as follows:
Done in County Court, EinbecK 11, on the
sth of February, 1890. at theresidence of
Capitalist Henning Hotter, in Marltoldeu
dorf. Present, County JudseWahrenburg.
at the request of the capitalist, Henning
KoÃter of Markoldendort.
The judge heretofore mentioned had gone to
his (Henning Koster's) residence for the pur
pose of taking down his last will. The said
Capitalist Koster was found in his residence
The same said that, by reason of his illness by
gout, lie had begged the court to call on him
for the purpose of taking a last will. After the
court had convinced itself by means of investi
gation that tne said capitalist, Henning
Koster, was in full possession of his mental
faculties, the same gave and caused to be
written down the following testamentary
dispositions.
A certificate is added showing that thÂ©
wi.l was properly deposited with the public
court, and that after the death of the
testator it was produced and the seal was
broken in the -presence of the widow
Because two attesting witnesses are rel
quired to a will which is to be submitted
for probate in California that formality
was complied with, although such a course
was not necessary under the laws of
Germany.
The estate outside of San Francisco is
said to amount to $500,000.
Statistics obow that out of the 5,000,000
inhabitants of London more than 300 000
iamilies earn less tnan 3s. a day.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Gal., Jan.
27.â From now on track athletics will
boom at Stanford. J. F. Kjnp, the well
known coach, took charge of the men yes
terday. When questioned as to his method
of training, he said that he would first
try the men to seÂ» for what events each
was bsst fitted. These trials will take in
about a week. After that the training
would, he said, be^more systematic. Bis
long experience in developing men led
him to believ* that best results could be
obtained by specialization. For this
reason he would not require much sym
nasium work, although some would be
prescribed to harden the men.
King believes Stanford's prospects this
year are very promising. He has kept
close watch of Stanford's steady improve
ment in field events and is doubly inter
ested, as several of his former pupils are
wearers of the cardinal. Dare Brown,
Stanford's wall-known mile runner and
present manager of the team, will assist in
training the men. He suggested several
slight changes in regard to the track cal
culated to improve the work of the ath
letes. These changes will be attended to.
J. F. King holds several athletic records
hims"lf. He has run the 100-yard dash in
:09 4-5, and In the high jump has oleared
6 feet 3 inches. He established tne world's
record in the old Caledonian eventâ the
hop, step and jump. He has trained the
Omaha Athletic Ciub track team and the
Olympic Club of San Francisco, and for
the past six years has acted as physical
director of the Multnomah Club of Port
land.
The track men expect H. P. Cross, who
coached the Stanford lootball men this
year, to visit them occasionally. He is at
present residing in San Francisco.

HEAD ON FIRE
â  No one can think of a more serious calamity
no one can realize its true tearfulnessâ the
hair of a. man burning. Very few men hare
ever experienced this, yet it is not much
worse than the silent, steady declining force*,
in man. YOUNG MAN, if you are troubled
with vital losses; if you are troubled with ex-
hausting complaints, pimples, baahfulness,
aversion to society, stupidness, despondency,
loss of energy, loss of ambition,' loss of self-
confidence; if you find your manhood slipping
away from you, make an effortâ make a
feeble effortâ and come to the Hudson Medical
Institute and consult with the doctors who
have created the wondrous "HUDYAN." Tail
"HUDYAN" cure is positive. This Is stated,
knowing there are hundreds and hundreds of
so-called cures. If you will walk with us
through our corresponding department, you
will find on the shelves rows and rows of testi-
monials from suffering, humanity, and these
letters come from all parts of tne United
States. From the little hamlets and big town*
and large cities, from New York, from Chi- j
cago, from Petaluma, these testimonials tell a
grand tale. They tell a tale of relief and cur*
of men who deemed themselves incurable.)

Seven Long Races That Kept

Finishing Second in the Handicap.

It takes more than a drizzling dowD
pour of rain to dull toe appetite of a
California race-going public Sucu a lact
would a critic arrive at if be were to see
the crowd pouring in through the gates of
lngleside irack yesterday, which, by the ;
way, was ''lauies' day."
There was an apparent look of relief de
picted on everybody's face that one day
was to pass without hall a dozen tiresome I
sprint dashes to be run off. The different |
events were all well contested, with a dash j
and vigor that imbued in them the real I
jwang of sport, and a repetition of the j
JpT-.r.'g.-amme is earnest y hoped for.
1 ; course mud is always a strong factor in
Foiling form players, butthe track was
hardly in a slushy enough condition to
interfere with the running, and the favor- i
niis met with more than ordinary success, j
four out of the seven choices sent to the
post returning with the coin.
The defeat of Pavid in the mile handi- j
cap was one of the hardest raps tht- talent |
received during the afternoon. He won j
on tiie day preceding with such consum
mate ease, that with 104 pounds in the
saddle and ;i strongly deve.oped penchant
for soft pomp, the chestnut horse was con
sidere : wet< nigh invincible.
T. McHugh had the leg up, and his
mount â rtii* backed from twos down to 3 to I
2. Caspar, with 99 pounds up, ridden by i
Jones, led the lust choice from the time
the barrier was raised ;nd headed him
i per the finishing line by a length and a
half in 1 :4" J. Schiller showed speed in me
szetch. ending up a fair third.
Though devoid of much class the open
ing mue run, with a tield of -eleven start- |
ing, ;urnished a good betting proposition.
Will Wallace's o.d horse, Manchester, rid
den by Charley Thorpe, was made favor
ite in the betting, but cut a very sorry
figure in the real running. La q t Chance,
a 5 to 1 shot, took the lead when half the
distance had been covered, and at ihe end
won easily by a couple of lengthi from
Japonica, a 30 to 1 ontsider.
The brown uorse Benamela had a very
enjoyable trip of it in the mile and a six
teenth event, decided under selling condi
tions tnat followed. With Willie Martin
up he went to the post a 9 to 10 choice and
Birupiy wallowed in ahead of Semper Lex.
Flashlight had a world of speed up to
within a furlong of the stand wh -re he be
gan tiring, eventually taKing the short
end of the purSe.
Th-e hurdle handicap, over a mile and a
furlong, saw another lavorite earn brack
ets, although by the narrowest of margins.
Andy Blakeiey's jumper, Mr. Reel, looked
to have all the best of the weights with
128 pound- up and was rightfully made an
even money chance. Cairns, wJjo had the

was a good third.
Seven three-year-olds next tried con

chase, Greyhurst, opened a strong b to o
favorite, but such a stiff play went in on
Stentor that the friends of the gruy geld
ing were able to get 8 to 5 for their money.
Loulou X, with r "c.itcb" of ninety-three
pounds, and "Paffle" Thompson in the
saddle, looked dangerous and the mare
was well supported at fmirs. Of the
others Personne was the most fancied.
When the barrier went lip Greyhurst
swerved and was away badly. Stentor
was slow to break and he too got some th*
worst of the break. Thorpe took advant

saved several loot lengths with the favor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
A FAKE THAT MAY CAUSE BLOODSHED.
The Examiner's Silly Story About the Arrest of See Yups in China May
Have Serious Results â The Chronicle in a Facetious Vein
Dissects the Latest Creelman Yarn.
The Examiner yesterday insisted that the fake story about the action of the Chinese Government at Peking a few hours
after the murder ot "Little Pete" in this city was true. A more palpable fake and a more brazen reiteration have never been
presented by the "monarch of trie fakers."
"Little Fete" was murdered Saturday
night The Examiner said on the Mon
day morning following that at 6 o'clock on
the morning of Sunday "The Chinese
Consul tn this city telegraphed the facts
of the murder to the Minister at Washing
ton," and that "early in the afternoon
word name back that in China eyery im
mediate relative of the local president ana
secretary of the See Yups was under
arrest"
Bearing in mind that at 6a. m. in San
Francisco the time is 9:45 p. M. in Cnina,
the palrable fake at once becomes appar
ent Allowing that it took one hour for
the transmission of the message to the
Chinese Minister at Washington and for
him to get his message under way for
Canton, and another hour to get th/news
to Canton, and it appears plain that it was
then within fifteen minutes of midnight.
The Governor of Canton then bad to
rouse the EmpÂ»ror, who must have heard
the news ai 1 a. m. or thereabouts il there
was no deiay. To get word back to San
Francisco early Sunday afternoon that the
relatives of the See Yup'orficials had all
been arrested was lively work. Roused at
1 a. m. it was necessary for the Emperor to
have all his arresu made and the news made up for transmission to San Francisco by 5:45 the next morning, allowing two
hours' time to get the news through, and estimating 2 p. m. San Francisco time as not too early to fit the description of early in
the afternoon.
Therefore, from 1 A. M. to 5:45 a. m., Pekiug time, the Emperor had to communicate his royal pleasure to the Governor of
Canton, and for the Governor and his satellites to hunt all over Canton with dark lanterns for "all the relatives of the president
and secretary of the See Yups," to cast the people, when found, into dungeons and to close up one of the most remarkable trans
actions ever recorded outside of the pages of the veracious author of the tales of Munchaasen and the fancies of the "Arabian
Nights."
"Away over in China," said the great faker on Monday morning, "that heavy hand has been laid upon the relative* of those
suspected of having a guilty knowledge of the death of 'Little Pete' ; men women and children are already in the dungeons,
wondering why they have been haled from their homes, trembling with the dread and apprehensive of the worst"
They had reason to tremble if there was any truth in the Examiner's yarn, for they were hunted out of bed not earlier than
2 a. M. and "not later than sa. m., Canton time, and to make a thorough search for them all and to have found them all would
have required the services of an army of winking, blinking and yawning officers.
Z^OZZi It is evident to the most casual thinker that there was no need for any such haste, more than there was need for any such
fake story. The people, according to the clocks, must have been ail asleep, and there was no reason to supp6se that premonitory
visions could wake them and send them scurrying into places of biding before morning. They could just as well have been arrested
The Emperor of China Issuing the Warrants for the Arrests.
the next forenoon, when they would have been equally unsuspicious of approaching danger, and it is strange that the absurdity of
the whole proposition did not at once become apparent to the laker, whose glib pen was guided only by the dictates of
imagination, in entire disregard of palpable facts.
"The Emperor of China has reached out to strike," continued the faker; "to punish the innocent in Peking that there may
be peace in the Chinese slums in San Francisco. That is Chinese justice. Whether it will be effective in this far laud is a matter
for the future to say.''
The absurdity of the whole proposition has been already demonstrated. It is not necessary to have the testimony of the
Chinese Consul and Vice-Consui in this City that no message was sent out on the Sunday following the "L'ttle Pete" murder â the
next day; but such denial was promptly made at the Chinese consulate. Indeed, the Chinese consular officers were appalled by
the effrontery of the Examiner fake.
The local Vice-Consul, King Owyang. made the following statement on Monday, the day when the Examiner's fake
appearpd, which ought to be and Is conclusive:
"Not only has no telegram been sent by the Consul-General to our Minister at Washington, but no one connected with
this consulate has told anybody so. In fact, to my certain knowledge 110 reporter of the Examiner was seen yesterday either
by the Consul or myseJf. Ido not care to draw down the censure of any newspaper on myself or the Consul, but am obliged to
correct such glaring misatatements of facts."
The Western Union people made it clear, by conclusive figures, that it would have been impossible for the news to have
gone to China ana for the respones to have been received in San Francisco in the prescribed time, adding corroborative proof of the
falsity of the whole story.
Yesterday the Examiner, with characteristic brazenness, insisted that its story of last Monday morning wastrne in the fol.
lowing words:
"The Call denies the truth of the statement that the relatives of the figbtine SeeYups and SamYups are being incarcerated
in China. It is hardly necessary lor the Examiner to reiterate th 9 statement and add that it is absolutely true. Th c news comes
from thoroughly reliable sources."
However, evidently not resting easy under the accumulating proof of its gigantic and foolish fake, it tried to justify itself
and still further fool the public by asserting that it maintains special correspondents in all parts of the world, spending large
sums for their salaries and expenses.
in the light of the fact:* nbove quoted, tne necessity for having these allege I correspondents does not appear, for nothing
that they could ever send as news could begin to rival the productions of the fiction department which predominates in the edi
torial rooms of the "monarch of the fakers."
Probably nothing "nervier" in the war of a wind-up for a fake has been published than the following:
"Probably there is nothing stranger in all the history of governmentâ this pagan monarch moving to bring peace to a Chris
tian city ten thousand miles away, and far across the seas."
Probably not !
The Chronicle makes merry with the Examiner's fake story and The Call's thorough demonstration that it is a fake. Some
of the Chronicle's ideas are worded as follows:
"In the case of The Call the offense Is very rank. It seems that the Examiner beforo the body of 'Little Pete' had
grown fairly cold had the relatives in China of the local president and secretary of the See Yup clan s ifely lodged in jail. Ac
cording to this veracious chronicle an ex-Consul General of China, whose mortal form is in Cuba, but who-*e astral liody is pre
sumably here, telegraphs the facts of the murder at 6a.m. on Sunday to the Chinese Minister at Washington. The latter at oneÂ«
cabled them to Peking. With a promptness hitherto unknown in the official life of Cuina the Governor of Peking or the Viceroy
of Chih-li sent the news to Li Hung Chang and the Tsung-li-Yamen, while the latter, not stopping tor a long breath, carried it to
the throne.
"His Majesty, the brother of the sun and moon, 'pot a hustle on,' as the saying goes, and the resident families of the See Ynp
officials were dragged to the waiting cages, whereupon the Minister at Washington was notified. He in turn wired the astral body
h ere, and the lntter, eiebt hours alter he had sent ihe first message, handed the news to the Examiner. What made the romance
the more remarkable and interesting was the assumption thnt the Chinese Emperor and Ministers had done all their work by
niiiht. The envoy at Washington got his news, if instantly, at 9a. m., Eastern time. At that moment tne clock marked nearly 9
p. m. in Peking. It m-as, say, 10 p. m. when the Governor of Peking was pulled out of bed. A return message to San Francisco
was then due in six hours, which gave the Emperor and his Cabinet until 4 o'clock in the morning to get hold of the See Yup peo-
Dle and make things warm for them."
, LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 27.â The San Francisco Examiner's fake Chinese story of two days ago, having been taken
seriously by the leaders of the warring tongs of this city, has stirred up the belligerents to a state of unprecedented fury and is
likely to be the immediate cause of bloodshed in the Cuinese quarter. The "monarch of the fakers" was being hawked about
Chinatown to-day, and no amount of warning that the story was a mere fake seemed to allay the excitement. It aeems that
the "Heathen Chinese " know nothing about fnke journalism.
The incredulous Mongolians seemed to think thnt what one newspaper did the others copied or Indorsed, and they could
not be' swerved from this conviction and it was learned that, generally speaking, this is the prevailing notion about this latest
at upendous fake in "swift" journalism on the coast.
A Call correspondent visited some oi the most prominent Chinamen in Chinatown this forenoon in order to get their views
upon the subject. The first Ihree visited could "not sabe,'' or at least they claimed they could not, but when approached upon
other matters could un derstand all right, The office of a well-known interpreier was visited.
The correspondent found him busily engaged in reading up the account oi "Little Pete's" killing, as published in the Ex
aminer. In fact, he had copies of all the leading paoers of San Francisco before him. He was asked what effect, if any, the ac
tion of the Emperor woul 1 have in this country as portrayed in the "Monarch." "Bad effect," was the reply. "There will be a
heap more trouble than before."
"Do you anticipate any trouble among your people in Los Angeles?" was asked.
"I'm afraid bo, he answered. "Some bad men have rome here in the last few days. The boycott trouble ia not over, and
'Little Pete' had many friends among the Sam Yups. There was a big meeting last night, but I don't know what was done. It
was the .'â¢am Yups that held the meeting."
Chief Glass stated that trouble is looked for at any moment in Chinatown, but he is prepared to give the warring factions a
warm reception.

CHINESE MUST
OBEY THE LAW
Chief Crowley's Drastic
Letter to the Consul-
General.
Firecrackers Must Not Be Ex
ploded DuriDg Their New
Year.
All Violators of the Law in This
Respect Will Be Suverely
Punished.
The lawlessness that has existed among
the Chinese in Chinatown* for years past
culminating in the minder <>r Little Pete
has pat Chief Crowley on his mettle and
in the future the Chief intends to compel
the Chinese to abolish the customs of
their own country, which they hare been
permitted to indulge in unmolested.
One of the privileges granted the Chi
nese has been the indiscriminate use of
firecrackers during their New Year festivi
ties. This year that privilege has been
withdrawn and the Chief has notified the
Chinese Consul that the explosion of fire
crackers is prohibited by law and that the
violators will be severely punisned.
The conclusion of the Chief's letter to
the Consul, which was sent yesterday,
conveys a world of meaning to the Chi
nese. The letter is as follows:
Office chief oe Police, )
San Fbancisco. J*n. 27, 1897. i
Hou. Fung Wing Hing, Imperial < hinete Cnn
sul-Ucrural,Bo6Stockton strut, Cityâ Dear Sir:
Will you plt-ase notify your coumryiuen thai
the explosion of firecrackers in this City is
prohibited by law and that the violators wiil
be severely punished?
No permit will be granted to any one this
year to explode firecrackers in this City dur
ing the Ciiine.-e New Year. In connection with
this matter it may be well lor me to state that
hereiofore your countrymen have been treated
with great consideration by the authorities of
this City in matters bearing upon the habits
and customs of their country at or about their
New Year. Recent events have shown that a
very large proportion of the Chinese popula
lation are unworthy of being granted favors
or privileges ol any kind, because they do not
appear to have any respect for our imvs, but
set them at defiance.
When the ire of the American people be
comes aroused in this matter the Chinese will
discover their mistake, and this question will
probably ba settled in a summary way. Re
spectfully, P. ckowley, Chief of Police.
CHINATOWN IS STARTLED.
Rumors of Foui Schemes Frighten
the Mongolians m d Amuse
the Police.
Rumors by the score, some startling and
others truly oriental in their ludicrous
ness, are fleeting litce lightning flashes
through the dark alleys and narrow re
cesses of Chinatown. Last evening Ser
geant Cook was informed that a foul
scheme to assassinate a police officer had
been concocted by the highbinder;.
First the rumor bad it that the Sam
Yups had men posted on the ro< fs over
looking the streets ready to shoot an
officer and blame the killing on the See
Yups. Later the report was reversed, sev
eral Mongolians stating that the See Yups
were the plotters. The police are not in
clined to cieuit the story, but nevertheless
many an officer patrolling his beat
glances aloft much of tener than occasion
stems to require.
About 9 o'clock Chinatown was again
startled by the rumor that Dong Gong, in
terpreter and police informant, had been
shot to death. Later the report simmered
down and rumor had it that the interpre
ter had been shot in the leg. Sergeant
Cook investigated the affair, and found
Dong safe and uninjured in his home,
guarded by a police officer.
The most startling report of all origi
nated in Sullivan alley. Here a number
of Chinamen informed Officer McGavern
and Special Officer Downey that the high
binders were storing arms and ammuni
tion in an underground dungeon near Pa
cific street, preparing to do battle with
the whites in case tbey were molested i i â 
their controversies. But this is looked
upon as a hoax.
LOS ANGELES DEBUTANTE.
Miss Trei Bemynton Makes a Success
at the Tifoliâ Clever Work at
the Alcazar. .
Debutantes seem to be the order of the
week at the local theaters. Tbe last to
join the ranks is Miss Yves Remynton,
a Los Angeles girl, who made her first
public appearance on any professional
stage last nigiu in the title role of Wal
lace's "Maritana" at the Tivoli. She has
sun? a good deal at concerts and amateur
performances in the City of the Angels,
but she is quite unknown here, and, there
fore, won tne hearty applause she received
entirely on her own merits.
Miss Remynton is a slim, dark girl, who
looked very well in her gypsy's dress,
and entered with so much spirit into her
part that she <iid not convey the impres
sion of a beginner. She has a limit but
penetrating voice, which is sweet and
sympa Ik tic in quality and shows evi
dences of good training. A t first she suf
fered from nervousness and showed a
slight tendency to sing out of tune, but as
the opera progressed she shoos off her
nervousness and did excellent work.
The rest of the cast of "Maritana" is
good. R:.ys Thomas never appeared to
better advantage than he is doing as Don
Caesar de Bazan. His singing of "Let Me
Like a Soldier Fall" is nightly encored
again and again. John J. Raffael is also
excellent as Don Jo-e.
On Saturday nieht the new burlesque,
"Aladdin," will be produced.
"The Devil's Auction," which has
bright, new acts and dances this week,
has only a few more days to run et the
Columbia. On Monday the humorous
farce-comedy, "A Prodigal Father," will
open at the Columbia. One of the special
ties announced ior this piece is the toe
dancer, Titenia. Titenia is a Utah girl
but her successes have been made at the
Olympic and the Casino 111 New York.
. The rough edges in Monday night's per
formance of "Magda" at the Baldwin
Theater have been worn away by practice
and the play is now running quite
smoothly. "Magda" will be the bin Kfr
to-night, Friday night and the Saturday
matinee. On Saturday evening "Marie
Stuart will be presented.
One of the best performances of "All
the Comforts of Home" seen in San Fran
cisco is being given at the Alcazar. Mrs.
Bates, as tbe terrible Mrs. Be, tier, is thor
oughly in her element and arouses roars
of laughter by the sincerity of her domi
neering ways. J. B. Polk was never more
at home than as her luckless spouse,
whose tastes incline him to give little
breakfasts to opera singers and whose
duty-chains him to Mrs. Bender's side.
The affectation which often mars Jfiaa
Beatrice Lieb's acting really helps her in
the role 01 Fid Orotanski, the frivolous
opera singer with a taste for champagne
breakfast?.
Hugo Toland is still suffering from
hoarseness, but was a good deal better
last night. Miss Juliet Crosby and Miss
Gertrude Tidball, the two debutantes, are
quite at home on the sta<?e, and Francis
Powers, May Buckley and Walter Belasco
contribuie to the fun of the pi^ce.
William Gilctte's "A Legal Wreck" will
be next week's bill.
"The Orphans of New York" is ex^rtim?
its drawing powers well at the Grand.
Edward I. Heron gets through the dash
ing part of the resourceful "Shiner" in a
way that is eminently sa.isfactory to the
hearers, and the children are doing espe
cially pretty work.
Bessie Clayton has firmly established
herself in the good will of the Orpheum
public by her clever dancing and contor
tion work, and Kiralfy has bocome auite a

next week.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
Perhaps Creelman is a myth.
After all there is no news but legitimate
news.
What Willie Hearst lacks most is a ref
eree lor news.
Somebody has been making a guy of
the Examiner.
With the new journalism any old thing
does as a fak3.
Philadelphia tempered her blizzard
with a tire, but it did not comfort any
body.
It takes time, work, energy and money
to get genuine news, but anybody can
write a fake.
By and by the fake journals will learn
that it is better to know less news than to
know so much that ain't so.
People may read fake papers for amuse
ment, but they must turn to legitimate
journalism to find out what the news is.
"It is hardly necessary for the Examiner
to reiterate the statement and add that it
was absolutely true." And yet it did so.
As one of the new British warships ha
been named Goliath some tugboat ought
to get in and knock it out with a sling
shot.
If the Examiner managers bad any sense
of humor they would see that Creeiman
and all the other fakers are just playing
them for soft things.
The rains of this winter are coming just
right to suit the orchardists. They could
not have arranged the weather better if
they had held a convention to do it.
In locating Li Yung Yuen in this City,
although he has been in Cnba for four
months, the Examiner got the Li all right
and that is as much as it ever wishes.
The next thing we know, some clever
joker will sell Long Green Lawrence a
telegram from Mars signed Li Yung
Yuen, and Willie Hearst will have to pay
for it.
If the Examiner pays as much as 14
cents for such stuff as its Chinese dis
patches it is not to be wondered that it
has to resort to devious methods for
raising the long green.
Why should the Examiner try to induce
the public to believe it keeps high-priced
liars in various parts of the world when
its Chinese dispatches show that its big
gest and rawest lies are dug up in its own
office.
When a newspaper is roped in by such
a raw fake as an alleged dispatch from
China to an official in San Francisco when
that official has not been here for four
months it is time for somebody to make a
shake-up in that office.
In objecting to the Nicaragua canal
under the coutiol of the United States
the Government of the Greater Republic
of Central America is taking a very good
way to get the whole country under the
august protection of Uncle Sam.
It is to be regretted that the Examiner,
after having enterprise enough to get
news to China and back in ten hours, did
not have enough sense to get information
from Stockton street of the name of the
Chinese Consul-General in this City.
Tbe vehement reply of the Examiner to
our light and amusing skit at its ''dis
patches from China" was written in the
tone of an editorial, flashed up in the
form of a news story and displayed in the
advertising columns. Why were those
things thus?
Not long ago the scuaming faker pub
lished a statement that ibe President of
the United States bad entered into a
secret treaty with the Spanish Govern
ment to crush the Cubans, and "it is
hardly necessary for the Examiner to re
iterate the statement and add that it was
absolutely true."
The Examiner says Li Yung Yuen is in
this City, that be holds the office of
Chinese Consul-General and is in danger
of assassination for sending a dispatch of
Little Pete's death to the Chinese Minister
at Washington. As Li is not in this City,
is not Consui-General and sent no such
dispatch the statements are good ex
amples of what the Examiner news service
is worth.
The wild romance of the Emperor of
China waking up in the middle of the
night to send officers over his empire to
arrest men whose names he did not know
and then telegraphing at 4 o'clock in the
morning the result of his activity to San
Francisco for the information of a man in
Cuba is surely amusing, and all the more
so because some solemn fellow thought it
was serious and paid for it as news.
Governor Pingree of Michigan has found
so many laws in that State either ob
solete or so construed by the courts as to
be inoperative that he has offered a re
ward of $25 to the student of the Univer
sity of Michigan who will compile the
greatest number of such laws, and has ap
pointed a commission to decide the con
test. The compilation will be not only a
good exercise for the students but it will
serve to call attention to the useless
statutes and prepare the way for their
abolition. It would not be a bad idea for
every State in the Union to have a similar
overhauling.
A SAD DEPEOT.
The vagaries of the Examiner are such
that f w people are surprised by any new
antic it may commit. With it anything
goes, from extorting money from a rail
road to bunkoing a prize-fight, and it
fakes with equal facility scandals artiome
and direful sensations abroad. Neverthe
less, so far as it was capable of surprising
anybody it did so yesterday in a double
column, double-leaded, double-dyed at
tack on The Call for giving to one of its
mo3t amusing fakes the advantage of
free advertising in the homes of intelli
gent people.
The Call had pointed out that the as
sertions of the Examiner concerning the
arrest in China oi the relatives of persons
suspected of the murder of ; 'Litte Pete"
was a fake. It showed that the feat of
telegraphing news to China and back
again could not have been performed;
that no such telegram as stated by the
Examiner had been sent from this Cily by
the Chinese Consul-Gsneral; that no tele
graph office in this City had received or
dispatched such a telegram, and finally,
that Li Yunj; Yuen, whom the Examiner
declared to be the Chinese Consul-General
in this City, has been in Cuba for upward
of four months. Surely this was a good
proof of thepcwers of imagination which
exist in the Examiner office, and was a
good advertisement of its ability to keep
pace with the latest developments of the
so-called new journalism.
So far from being grateful for our adver
tising, or recognizing the humor of the sit
uation, the Examiner took up the matter
seriously. It declared that it has great
opportunity to know everything that hap
pens because it has correspondents all
over the world, from Madrid to Shanghai.
The earnestness with which it made these
claims showed that in its solemn stupid
ity it was not aware of the fact that we
had not charged it with a lack of corre
spondents elsewhere, but only that it did
not send a reporter to the office of the
Consul-General on Stockton street in this
City.
The Examiner asserts with a dignity
truly pompous that concerning the "In
carceration," as it calls it, of the relatives
of the fighting Bee Yups, "it is hardly
necessary for the Examiner to reiterate
the statement and add that it was abso
lutely true." Surely we can agree to that
proposition. It was entirely unnecessary
for the Examiner to do so. Nobody
thought the statement true when pub
lished, nobody thinks it is true now, and
there is certainly no necessity for the Ex
aminer's young men to lie in editorials
when they could lie in the local columns
at space rates.
It is clear the managers of che Exam
iner are lacking in a sense of the ridiculous,
as well aa of veracity. They cannot see that
these clever fakers from Madrid to Shang
hai, and not a few in San Francisco, are
simply {joying Mr. Hearst and selling
him any old thing for news. They are
slyly stabbing Long Green Lawrence
to make Willie Hearst bleed. Tnev send
him any sort of a fake, no matter how
raw, and he is unable to see that the stuff
is absurd.
Long Green cannot even keep posted on
local affairs sufficiently to know the name
of such an important official as the Chi
nese Consul-General in this City. A faker
brings him a dispatch which he alleges to
have been written by an official on Stock
ton street when the official has been for
four months in Cuba, and the Long Green
manager, not knowing the difference,
calls it news from China and pays out Mr.
Hearst's money for it.
It is a tad defect, this lack of a sense of
the ridiculous. It has led Long Green
Lawrence into many an ngly situation
and most woefully has Willie Hearst had
to bleed for it.
A IEEE MARKET.
A bill has been introduced into the
Legislature by Senator Hall providing for
the establishment and maintenance of a
free public market on the water front of
thi-> City, and we have, therefore, a chance
to obtain this long-desired and much
needed public improvement.
The bill requires that the Harbor Com
missioners shall set apart a sufficient
number of docks on the water front, con
tiguous to each other, for the reception of
all perishable products, including fruit,
vegetables, eggs, poultry, game, dairy
products and fish, coming into San Fran
cisco, and shall permit the sale there of
such articles by or for account of the
producers only.
Other sections of the bill provide the
details for carrying out the plan, and
seem well adapted for that purpose. The
measure is, therefore, one which on its
face is deserving the support of the Legis
lature, and, while it ought to have care
ful consideration, so that no mistake may
be made in the enactment of such im
portant legislation, it should, neverthe
less, be free from merely petty criticism or
ill- founded opposition.
People of San Francisco have for a Jong
time past had the subject of a free market
under consideration. It has been fully
discussed both in the press and by those
who would be interested in it, and has
everywhere received favor and support.
It would be an important step in the
direction of bringing the producer into
close relations with the consumer, and
would, therefore, be a benefit to the great
majority of the people, both of the City
and of the interior of the State.
There is no reason apparent why there
should be any opposition at all to a
measure which promises to be of such
public benefit The bill provides that the
Harbor Commissioners shall assign space
within the free market to all producers of
perishable products, and to all commission
merchants and agents of producers who
shall make application therelor and agree
to transact business within the free market
solely for producers' account, and under
such regulations aÂ« the Harbor Commis
sioners may prescribe. Commission mer
chants are not to be permitted to occupy
space to the exclusion of genuine pro
ducers, and no rent is to be charged.
These provisions seem to cover the
essential points desired by the people in
the establishment of such a market, and
the bill on the whole appears to be a good
one. It has been introduced into the
Legislature in response to a popular de
mand caused by an urgent need, and is,
therefore, one of the measures now before
the Legislature which should receive
warm support and be promptly enacted.
WOBK AT SACRAMENTO.
The legislative session at Sacramento
has thns far been dull except for the one
sensation of the stuffed payroll. This is
not a bad sign. Dull sessions are gener
ally business sessions, and from all reports
this promises to be one of that kind.
The main work of legislation is neces
sarily done in committee, where there is
no opportunity for oratory and little
chance for making reputation!. It is this
committee work which now occupies the
attention of members of both houses, and
it is gratifying to note that they are devot
ing their time to that instead of making
sensational speeches on the floor of the
Senate or of the Assembly.
It happens that at this time both par
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
ties in the Assembly are led with mere
than ordinary parliamentary skill and
business discretion. The actual leader of
the Republican majority, and therefore
the virtual leader of tha Assembly itself,
is Judge Dibble, than whom no abler par
liamentary leader exists in the State.
The Democratic and Populist fusion, so
far as it is capable of loilowing leadership
at all, foliows that of Carainetti, and is,
therefore, much better directed than
minorities have been in times past.
The people of California can well afford
to have a dull and strictly business ses
sion of the Legislature this year. The
stuffed payroll has furnished more than
all the scandal and sensation which there
was any demand for. It has served to
attract the attention of the general public
to the Legislature, and been a warning to
the legislators themselves to be on their
guard against extravagance and reckless
ness in t&e expenditure of public money.
From this time on the people will be well
satisfied if the Legislature attends closely
to its work and furnishes economy in pub
lic business rather than profusion of ora
tory.
It must be borne in mind that the work
in committee is after all the most im
portant woik which the legislator per
forms. It is by committees that bills are
drafted and put into proper shape to pro
vide for the welfare of the public, and to
guard against the attacks of the courts.
When the work has been well done in
committee the debate and the vote in the
Assembly and the Senate are very little
more than acts of ratification, and hardly
count in the serious work of the session.
How important this committee work is
may be estimated from the report that up
to date there have been introduced into
the Assembly alone as many as nine bills
dealing with the subject of road improve
ment. This multiplicity of bills referring
to one subject involves the committee in
charge of that subject in the difficult task
of combining and harmonizing them into
one comprehensive measure. Committee
work, therefore, while dull, is in every re
spect important, and it is to be noted as
a good sign of the coming results of the
session that the members seem content to
perform this duil work with zeal rather
than to endeavor to make reputations for
themselves by holding long debates and
giving utterance to Duncombe oratory.
"ME, TOO."
A number of the leading Democratic
newspapers of the country are predicting
a split -in the Republican party, stormy
times for the McKinley administration,
and a oeneral row in the next Congress.
As a rule they offer no reason for these
predictions, but when they do they assert
that Senator Piatt of New York is going
into the Senate to oppose McKinley, and
that he will lead an anti-administration
faction of Republicans in that body.
The value of these predictions may be
estimated from the credibility of the sole
reason given for them. If any man be
lieves that Senator Platt is going to start
or 10 encourage a faction fight in the Re
publican party, he has been either a very
careless reader of current events, and
knows little of the character of Mr. Platt,
or else he is utterly unfitted to draw con
clusions from the facts that are known to
him.
Senator Platt long ago received what
was then regarded as the disreputable
name of "Me, Too." The name wa3 not
given him for nothing. It stuck to him
because it was characteristic of him. He
was a follower of Roscoa Conkling, and
was loyal in his following. Ho believed
in party discipline and he acted upon it.
When the crisis came in tbe fortunes of
his great leader and oi the organization of
his party in his State he did not hesitate
to resiern a aeat in the Senate rather than
to be found false to the discipline which
he honored, the leader whom he loved
and the organization which he served.
By holding steadfastly on his course
Mr. Platt has demonstrated his fitness to
cad as well as to follow. The name "Me,
Too" has ceased to be one of opprobrium.
It is now recognized as the name of a man
who can always bs counted on to support
his party organization whenever his help
is needed. He is not one who will break
away from the ranks under the strain or
stre-s of whatever battle may come. He
is not only an advocate but an exemplar
of discipline. He has shown it in the
past, and there can be no question that he
will more splendidly illustrate it in the
future.
Those Democrats therefore who are hop
ing to gain some advantage for their dis
rupted, disorganized and discredited party
by confusion among Republican leaders
in the next four years will be disappointed
so far as their hopes are based upon any
lack of fealty and ioyaity in Senator Platt.
It is an easy and a safe prediction that
whenever the Republican party under the
leadership of Major McKinley calls upon
the Senate for support of any great meas
ure the Senator lrom New York will be
found prompt to sustain it and ready to
answer now as he did of old, "Count in
me, too."
ARBITRATION TREATY.
Some Kecison* Why California' t Sena-
torn Should Oppose It.
M. Cooney, the well-known attorney of
this City, has forwarded to United States
Senators Perkins and White a communi
cation of which the following is a copy:
At the suggestion of many citizens of thli
State i aslc you to oppose tne ratification of the
so-called arbitration treaty between our Gov
ernment and England vow pending in the
Senate. Many reasons are assigned for oppos
ing it and none in favor, save the sentimental
idea of International peace. Opposed to this
comes the suggestion that up to this time we
have succeeded fairly well in that respect. I
may add, too, that the United States must de
pend upon the Nation's own strength to main
tain international peace as well as the Monroe
or any other American doctrine. But if a
treaty should be deemed useful why should
our people accept any European monarch as a
limit arbitrator? Again, What is there to ar
bitrate ? If any question should arise at any
time similar to the Venezuela affair, at
home or upon any other part of the
western continent, no trouble would
be had in securing a commission for
that particular purpose, and If it could not bo
arbitrated in that summary way surely it
could not be by the terms of a standing treaty,
which must necessarily be more complicated
and more difficult of construction. Suppose
any of the subjects of England in her many
provinces, sucn as Canada, Ireland or any
other people, should declare for independence
and the iriends of liberty in this country
should feel it their duty to give them aid and
encouragement, would not the United States
be likely to be dragced into the affair by rea
son of this treaty? "iou see England acquired
by conquest and holds by force many of her
provinces, while the United States acquired
none in that way and holds none by force.
The people of the colonies did, however,
acquire these United States from England by
force and descendents of that people, the citi
zens of this Republic, are well able to maintain
the independence and integrity of this Nation
witbln her own borders and before the world
without any alliance with England or any
other European power Thus you will see that
England has nothing to lose by this treaty,
and I am unable lo see where the United States
can gain by it. Very respectfully,
M. coojrax.
LATE MARTIAN ADVICES.
Brooklyn Eagle,
If the same thing had happened on our
planet that has occurred In Mars, the arctic
explorers could probably take their vessels
right up to the top of the earth. A big rift
has occurred in the Martian ice cap, and an
immeuse section of ice is probably moving
bo u tli ward, leaving an. opes. nua.
ARE YOU AN EPICURE?
If you are you will be thoroughly interested and eagerly concerned in the subject of the
very newest and latest of all dishes calculated to tempt the palate.
If you are not you will, nevertheless, experience a lively hankering to know just what
this rare, new discovery may De.
"You may be partial to frogs, or snails,' or
turtle or terrapin; but this dish to which we
refer is incomparably Better than any of
those enumerated.
It is declared to be the most delicious food
known to man.
There is no doubt but that there are dozens
of appetites even right , here in San Francisco
60 jaded that they are willing to test anything
new in the form of something to eat.
â  But in this instance the epicure will have
the remarkable advantage of having forced
upon him ,by fashion something that' is
palatable, and will not have to go through his
usual punishment when adopting a new
dish and in acquiring a new taste. I
The caterers and those in charge of the
culinary departments of the downtown clubs
P caterers and those in charge of the
departments of the downtown clubs
will be particularly attracted by the new fad.
It will mean a new. useful and healthful
industry in country places.
And what is this wonderful dish? And what kind of an industry is at the back of it?
This you will find out in Sunday's Call. It will tell you all about it, and you may be
assured that the story is an extraordinarily good one.
We may live without books!
What is knowledge but grieving?
We may live without hope!
What is hope but deceiving?
We may live without Jove!
What is love but repining?
But civilized man
Cannot live without dicing.
Just 10.
The question of the new dish and its merits is of as much importance almost ai the one
which relates to the discovery of poetry in the plaint of a Noguchian Snail.
The Sunday Call will tell you about the most marvelous of recent departures in the
world of the winged wheel.
Everybody wants to know about it. If not because he is a lover of the biking sport, then
because his friends are, and because he wants to keep up with the times on a matter that the
multitude is certain to discuss.
This bicycle invention is going to knock all previous records into the middle of ne~t week,
or somewhere still further back in the horse-monopolied past.
The newest macnine, of which a full description will appear in Sunday's Call, is uestined
to cut the time lor a mile down to less than a minute.
Think of ltl Lightning express locomotives won't be in the race, and the running horse
will be dbfeated with an ease that will put its rider to blush.
Novel things in science, literature and art; treasures of poetry and Bong. You will have
them served up to you to your heart's delight in The Sunday Call.
WHY THERE WERE NO DEMOCRATS ON THE LIST.
Marriot Brosius of Pennsylvania, who is the author of the bill introduced in Congress pro-
Tiding for the retirement of civil service employes of the Government, tells a good story
In connection with the recent criticism of Cleveland for extending the civil service over
thousands of offices after be bad turned the Republicans out and filled the offices witb
Democrats, iays the Washington Post. Brosius
maintains that the Republicans have every
thing to gain and nothing to lose by the adop
tion of the merit system, and in substantia
tion of this relates an incident told by Major
Harlow of the Civii Service Commission about
B. B. Smalley, the well-known Democrat, Col
lector of Customs in Vermont. One day some
of the Democrats came to the Vermont Col
lector and complained:
"See here, Mr. Smalley, you have not got any
Democrats in your office. These fellows hold
ing the Government positions are all Repub
licans."
"I am afraid not," said the Collector, regretfully, "The trouble is, our Vermont Democrats
don't go to school as they should do, and until they do there is no way of getting them Govern
ment positions."
NO HOPE FOR THE MEN.

"What is it, my son?" inquired the priest.
"That when I am dead, tather, you will put

Mile Antoinette Trebelli, who has Just ar
rived from Australia, will begin her American
nÂ«.rt tour at the California Theater
C oÂ°n Tv sdav! February 9, Gustav Hinrich,
will conduct a grand orchestra, organized for
The occasion. Mile. Trebelli is a well-known
concert singer, especially in England, Holland
Russia and Germany. A few years ago , .he
came to America for a brief season udiiv
with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and
with Theodore Thomas' orchestra. Special
inducements were offered her to make a more
extended tour in America at the time, but she
had made a contract to sing with Hans
Jiichter's orchestra in London, and therefore
could not remain in this country. She is pas
sionately fond of traveling, however, and
nearly two years ago set out on a tour of the
world under the management of the well
known lmpressario. Vert. She toured in South
Africa, penetrating; as far as Zululand, then
went to Zanzibar, and afterward toured all

over Australia. Mile. Antoinette Trebelll is
still quite a young woman. She is the daugh
ter of the famous contralto, Trebelii, though
her own achievements in the musical line do
not cause her to depend on her mother for
fame. Antoinette, however, has never cared
to sing in opera, so tnat her name is not so
widely known as it would have been if she
had been appearing at the great opera-houses.
She is a soprano with great flexibility of exe
cution. At her concert she will confine her
self chiefly to grand operatic arias, with
orchestral accompaniment
The admfmstration of La Scala, In Milan,
has started a new departure in the way of
providing facilities for press representatives
on the second floor of the great opera-house,
a large and elegantly furnished room having
been placed at the disposition of the press. The
apartment is provided with every facility for
writing, telegraphing, telephoning, dispatch
ing messages, etc. This is an innovation that
would be warmly welcomed in other cities
beside Milan, for it is often a great conveni
ence to newspaper men to be able to write,
telegraph or telephone between the acts, and
in the majority of American theaters not the
slightest accommodation is provided for pen
ning a line. A wail has been going up from
some of the New York dramatic critics that
in many cases their offices are situated too far
from the theater to go there to write after the
performance, and no accommodation being
provided by the managements of the theaters,
they have to rush to a messenger office and
write hastily in the midst of the noise and
clatter.
A Berlin newspaper, the Gegenwart, pub

roles: "Illustrious and divine friend, 1 can

admiration is his. My friend, will you have
the kinduess to tell the excellent artist couple
how much their work has exalted and en

"Berg, 12th June, 1865.
"Addressed to the t>oet of tÂ»xt and of music,
Richard Wagner."
At Triebschen, near Lucerne, a plaque bear
ing an inscription hat just been placed at the
entrance to the villa, on the banks of the Lake
of the Four Cantons, which Wagner inhabited
during the six years after his departure from
Munich. The inscription is in these terms:
"In this house Richard Wagner lived from the
Ist of April, 1866, till the month of April,
1872. It was here that the master first began
the 'Meisteriingers,' -Siegfreid, 1 'The Dusk of
the Gods', the 'Imperial March' and the
'Siegfried Idyl.' " This plaque will set at re.n
a misapprehension on the part of couriers and
guides, for the villa is generally pointed out
to tourists as the spot where Wagner wrote
"Lohengrin," perhaps because its proximity
to the water and the low green bank recall
the scene in "Lohengrin" when the swan first
arrives.
A rather curious Incident happened at the
Paris Opera Comique the other day during the
performance of "Mignon." Mile. Fernande
Dubois, who sang the title role, was out of
health, but not wishing to disappoint the
public she took what she thought were
some drops of a calming potion to
steady her nerves, but by accident took
a drug which caused her to fall in a dead
faint soon alter she had gone on the stage.
The curtain was lowered and Mile. Parentanl
hastily replaced her comrade and the opera
was about to be taken up where the other
Mignon had fainted, but the audience pro
tested, orylng out that i t would have "Mignon"
from the commencement, so the opera was be
gun all over again and came to a close nearly
an hour later than usual in consequence of the
interruptions.
Edward Grieg is in Vienna, where his con
certs are creating quite a sensation. Among
the pieces that he has conducted is "Bergliot,"
which although not an absolute novelty is not
widely known. It is a monologue, which is
given without accompaniment, but the or
chestra adds musical illustrations quite inde
pendent of the monologue. This form is abso
lutely new, and it seems the "Bergliot" has
met with great success in Vienna. Grieg Is
a'i?o being very much admired as a pianist .|
He plays as a composer and not as a virtuoso,
but even from the mechanical point of view
his playing is such that lew professional
pianists can compete with him.
Antoine Bruckner, the Viennese master yrbo
died recently, left by will all hia manuscripts
to the Imperial Library of Vienna. These
manuscripts have been handed over to the
library by Dr. Theodore Reisch and Professors
Loewe and Bchell have b.=en detailed to
classiiy them. They embrace the eight first
symphonies, part of the ninth, the mass in D
minor, 150 psalms and two choruses for male
voices.
La Menestrei states that Mile. Francesca
(MisÂ£ Fanny Simonds on of San Francisco) has
been singing, among Mine. Marchesi's other
pupils, at a recital in the Theatre Mondain be
fore she goes to Nice for the opera season.
In the mad scene from Ambroise Thomas'
"Hamlet" she made a great Impression. Borne
of the other pupils especially mentioned are a
young Canadian, Mile. Toronta, who is said to
possess a limpid voice of wide range; Misa
Papayane, a Russian singer, and Mile. Kirine.
Richard Pohl, a well-known writer on musi
cal subjects, has just died at Baden, near
Carlsruhe. He passed part of his life at
Weimar, where he was an intimate friend of
Franz Liszt, and he has published several
works on the Weimar master, as well as on
Berlioz and Wagner. It was he who wrote the
librettos of Schumann's "Manfred" and Lissf a
"Prometheus," and he also translated Berlioz's
works into German.
The Gazette of Cologne publishes a telegram
from St. Petersburg stating that that town has
just sent four carloads of musical instruments
(including pianofortes) to Abysslaia on an.
order from King Menelik. The dusky monarch
has also engaged a troupe of Russian musi
cians and a conductor to make music for him.
This opens up a new field for artists and for
manufacturers of musical Instruments.
A grand and very successful musical festival
has been given at Gand in honor of Mile. Au

the music performed was of Miss Holmes' own
composition and was all received with en
thusiasm. The duo from the last act of "La

It will be in vain to look for a permanent or
solid trade revival until after the tariff bill
gets on the statute book. As tho bill will prob
ably touch all the schedules in some degree,
there will be a good deal of uncertainty in
most of the Interests until the measure passes
into the President's hands. This will give a
speculative character to most of the business
done in tne larger fields in the interval, and
as a consequence the forces of industrial re
cuperation will be impeded lor the time. A
settlement of the question is imperatively re
quired at the earliest practicable moment, so
that business men can deal with certaintiea
and finalities. The country needs ample rev

wants a long rest from tariff tinkering.

IT WAS TOLD ON A
GOOSEBERRY BARREL
Story of a Burglary in
Hueppeden & Mueller's
Grocery.
French Maids and Other Ser
vants Gather Around in
Heartfelt Sympathy.
Two Clever Thieves Succeed in R fling
the Cashbcx of an Unsus
pecting German.
It was a cosmopolitan aggregation that
came and went all of yesterday to and
from Hueppeden & Mueller's grocery
store.
Something dreadful had happened, it
was quite evident, for the news of it had
spread for blocks around in an extraor
dinarily short space of time.
Burglars had visited ihe place; they
had stoleu money and things, and dear
Mr. Mueller, who was always so kind and
prompt in his attentions, might have
been murdered, perhaps, had he been
there when the thing occurredâ but he
was not.
That did not lessen the sensation, how
ever, around Golden Gate avenue and
Lott street, where the popular grocery
store is located. It is a neighborhood of
private houses and of people comfortable
enough in their situation in life to have
French maids with dainty caps, Japanese
boys with clean aprons or smoothly
shaven Chinese servant?.
They were all aware of the calamity
that had befallen tbe grocers, and the
rain cut little figure with them in their
decision to call and hear all about it from
the victims themselves.
Hueppeden, the younger man of the
firm, was alone in the store when a Call
reporter dropped in, his partner (Mueller)
having gone to the police office to tell his
troubles. To state it more correctly, only
one of the firm was in the store, but he
was not alone. Around him, as he sat on
a gooseberry barrel, the head of which
threatened any moment to shift and let
him fall through, were three inquirinc:
friends, each with his share of sympathy
and a desire to hear the details of the af
fair in all its minuteness.
"C'est terrible! 1 ' exclaimed the pert Jittlo
French maid from the 1900 block, who
hugged under her gossamer the baby boy
she had no right to have taken out in the
ram, as she heard the sorrowful grocery
man's tale of woe.
"Yes, it was," echoed Hueppeden. catch
ing the clritt of her remark. "You see,"
he continued, while adjusting the barrel
head that had become more insecure as he
wiggled about so as to address his re
marks in turn to an Irish woman of huge
proportions, who insisted upon having
her inquiries answered even if her sleeves
were rolled up and she wore no French
cap.
"It was all the money in the house to
pay our bills this month. Just think, 291
dollars and 90 cents."
Hueppeden is a rather good-looking
man on the sunny side of thirty-five. He
is possessed, too, with a magnetic way of
imparting his feelings as he addresses a
person, even if it is with tbe strong dia
lect of a German who comprehends better
than he speaks the English language,
His polit* attentions to the French maid,
offering her a cracker- box on which to sit,
and his pulling out a 100-pound sack full
of potatoes, on which he proposed to have
the Hibernian visitor rest herself while
they listened to his story, showed he
understood the delicate little attentions
pleasing to the other sex, and the de
meanor of both women indicated their
appreciation of his eallantry.
"Merci bien, monsieur," warbled the
maid.
"Mercy, too, says I," uttered the ma
tron; "peddlers are bad enough around
our place, without *mch things as buglars."
After serving a Japanese lad with some
small order, Hueppeden returned to his
barrel head, and bis late customer joined
the quiet little giri-servant who had been
standing all the while listening, wide of
mouth, to the horrible details of the
burglary.
As he sat there on a throne as insecure
as many others less pretentious, the grocer
strung ont bis yarn in an interminable
fashion. The froth had melted off the
growler an urchin bad had tilled in a
hurry a half hour previous for his thirsty
father, and the clocfc ticked wearily as
tne audience drank in repeated doses of
the same story, forgetting in their interest
their duties to their employers.
"There was a little fellow, just so
small," said Hueppeden, illustrating the
height by putting his hand to the chin of
the lady seated on the potato sack, she
reddening as in pleasure she had been se
lected and theretore became part of the
thrilling story.
"He came here about 9 o'clock yester
day morning and bought ten cents' worth
of wine. Then he went out by the back
way and called me to ask whether Dr.
Girisy lived down the street. He talked
with me for five minutes, and some other
fellow came in from the front and ran
away with the cashbox under the
counter."
This tale of woe was repeated hundreds
of times yesterday and the gang of burg
lars who have infested that portion of this
City near the panhandle of the park will
have to carry strone "jimmies" hereafter if
they hope to crack any houses in that
neighborhood, for there will be no more
doors careiesslv left open.
SUICIDE OF A CLERK.
Angus McMillan Become! Despondent
and X urns on the Gas.
Angus McMillan, a clerk, about 30 years
of age, committed suicide in bis room at
160 Ninth street by inhaling illumiuating
gas either Tuesday evening or yesterday
morning. His Dody was discovered at 6
.o'clock by J. McDonald, owner of the
house in which the young man took his
life. Both gas jets were turned on and
the body was rigid, showing that death
had taken place some hours before.
From papers found on the body it was
learned that the suicide had been em
ployed, ud to a iew months ago, as a clerk
in a St. Helena grocery-store. He leit
that position and came to this City, but
was unable to secure employment. It is
thought that owing to this fact he became
despondent, and deciding that life was
not worth the living killed himself.
Kevival Meetings.
The opening service of a special series of re
vival services was held at Simpson Memorial
Methodist Episcopal Church Monday evening,
which gives promise of developing into the
greatest religious awakening ever experienced
in that section of the City. Dr. Urmy, pastor
of tne First Church, preached a sermon on the
power of the Holy Spirit, and so moved the
people that many went to the altar. The Ep
worth League is out in force assisting in the
services These meetings will be under the
direction of Drts. Phelps, Urmy and Stephens,
who have combined for an extended series of
meetings at the three churches represented.
Dr. Phelps of California-street Church preached
last evening. _

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
The German Ship Watjcn Flew Her Flags Yesterday. She Was Decorated in Honor of the Thirty-
Seventh Birthday of Emperor William and the Captain Kept "Open House n in Consequence.
THE DOCTOR AND
THE DETECTIVE
Opposite Opinions as to What
Caused Nordhausen's
Death.
Doctor Taylor Says the Man
Cou'd Not Have Shot
Himself.
Detective Whittaker Says ths Evi
dence All Shov3 That
He Did.
The mystery surrounding the death of
C. C. Nordhausen. the wealthy dry-goods
merchant of Oakland, has been intensi
fied by the result of the autopsy upon the
body.
Ex-Coroner Dr. Taylor, who was tbe first
physician called to attend Nordbausen,
and Autopsy Surgeon Morgan performed
the autopsy yesterday afternoon and came
to the conclusion that the man was mur
dered and that the case was not that of a
suicide.
The fatal bullet entered the left breast,
and ranged downward until it struck one
ofthexibs. This bone turned the course
of the bullet inward and the leaden pellet
passed through the lung and lodged in the
back.
The doctors are satisfied that the bullet
was never fired by Nordhausen. The
weapon was discharged when the man
was lying on his side, and wa3 held either
over his shoulder or' at an angle with the
stock or handle considerably elevated.
A careful examination was made of the
raggea cut or wound in the forehead.
Nordhausen stated that it was caused by
a fall, but the physicians are convinced
that it was produced by a blow from a
blunt instrument. The edges were ragged
and bruised, and while the skull was not
fractured there was a clot of blood on the
brain under the wound.
Detective Ross \\ tiitaker, who has been
steadily working on the case, differs en
tirely from the opinion of Drs. Taylorand
Morgan, and from his investigations he
has no hesitation in saying that Nord
hausen shot himself.
Yesterday he procared the bullet that
was extracted from Nordhausen's bo ly at
St. Luke's Hospital and it tits exactly ihe
exploded sbell in the revolver that" was
found in Nordhausen's room in the Bald
win Hotel, and the sbell is an exact coun
terpart of the other four in the pistol.
The pistol was identified as Nordhausen's
by J. Heeseman, his nephew.
That is one reason why Whitaker scouts
the idea of murder. Another Is that the
necktie worn by Nordhausen is burned
and shows where the builet went through
it. The revolver is ono of the most diffi
cult to pull, and the presumption is that
to enable him to pull the trigger he had to
hold it at an angle, which would account
for the course of the bullet.
Besides there are the statements made
by Nordhausen before his death to differ
ent people that. he shot himself. First to
Manager Lake of the Baldwin Hotel, then
to the doctors at St. Luke's Hospital, to
Heeseman, his nephew, and to others.
The last person he talked to on the sub
ject was Robert Durat, steward at the
nospital. In answer to Durst's question
he said "1 shot myself.' 1
"What for?" asked Durst.
||"It was an accident," curtly replied
Nordhausen.
He was also asked about his watch and
chain and he replied, "Never mind about
that. It doesn't amount to anything.
That's all right."
â¢â¢There is no woman in the case," said
Whitaker last night. "Of that 1 feel as
sured. No woman was seen going in or
out of his room during the time he was at
the Baldwin. From the time he regis
tered at the Baldwin till six or eight hours
before he rang for the bellboy Monday
morning he had been drinking whisky
and absÂ» nthe. He was never known to be
a drinking man, and drinking to excess as
he was while at the Baldwin might have
had something to do with the shooting.
"The cut on bis forehead may have been
caused by a fail or he might hare got
mixed up in a scrap, but that had nothing
whatever to do with his death."
The friends of the deceased scout tbe
idea of his going off on a spree, They
think that he fell in with some thugs who
found his soft spot was Randsburg, and
in his enthusiasm over tbe subject he
failed to detect their character and that
they got him out, drugged, robbed and
murdered him. It is possible that when
assaulted he attempted to use his pistol.
He was an extremely sensitive man and
was just the person who would seek to
hide the mortifying circumstances of such
an event to the very last.
The deceased was worth about $100,000.
In addition to one-half interest in the
Reliance building he owns some real
estate in West Oakland, and also has re
cently made an investment in Randsburg,
the value of which is not known. He is
also the owner of some stock of unknown
value.
The funeral was arranged to-day to be
held Friday aftefnoon, but in view of the
developments this may be changed.
EMPEROR WILLIAM
WAS REMEMBERED
His Subjects Made a Gal
lant Display on the
Front.
In Spite of the Rain the Watj.'n

Commissioner Cole's Nime May Not
Appear in the Archives of the
Ferry Depot.
The birthday of Emperor William of
Germany wa^ celebrated on the water
front yesterday. Among the vesisels that
were decorated was the C. H. Watjen.
Although some of the stevedores were at
work, nevertheless not a man in the
ship's crew did a nand's turn. All on
board had a holiday and a regular holi
day dinner. The bill of fare, both fore
and aft, was the same, and every seaman
fared as well as the captain. After dinner
the health of Emperor William was arunk
in gin punches.
.Emperor William Is 37 years old, and
the Watjen is only one of the many ves
sels in the German mercantile marine
that celebrated his nativity. The Watjen
is 8 years old, and during that time not a
desertion has taken place. Daring his
career as master Captain Breming has
yet to find the man who wanted to leave
the C. H. W'atjen of his own accord.
The master has been trading to Cali
fornia bince 1874, and every year the vessel
has been in commission the crew has
never failed to assemble on January 27
and cive three cheers for the Emperor.
"Rates are so low," said Captain Biem
ing, ''that I will have to lay up. I offered
to pay my men off, but not one of them
would leave the ship. They agreed to ac
cept any terms I might offer, but insisted
on staying by the Watjen. Nearly all
have been on her for years and all look
upon her as a home.
Among the crew of the Watjen are the
sons of three German millionaires. Their
fathers sent the lads to sea sooner than
have them run away from home. One of
them is the son of one of the heaii men in
the North German Lloyds Steamship Com
pany ; another is the only son and heir of
the owner of twenty fashing steamers,
while the third is the prospective heir to a
baronetcy.
The Harbor Commissioners are in a
quandary.jln a few days the laying of "the
first stone" in the building will be a
necesity. The Risdon Iron Works has
faithfully performed xts part of the work,
and ail the iron work thot the contract
calls for has been put up. The corner
stone is also ready, but there is no stone
with which to continue the work. Agents
of the company have been applied to. but
they can give no definite answer, and the
chances are that weeks may elapse before
the foundation can be commenced.
In the meantime the cornerstone has
been made, and on it is the name of Har
bor Commissioner Cole. The latter goes
out of office next March, and should a
successor be appointed the beautiful Dlock
of marble will have be be defaced and the
name of the new Commissioner chiseled
in.
Another of the disengaged fleet will pull
op her anchor and depart for new quarters
within a few days. The Hiawatha will
leave in ballast for Newcastle, N.
S. W., to load coal for San Fran
cisco. The coal rate from Australia is
only about 15 cents less than that from
San Francisco to Europe, so many owners
figure that it is cheaper to send a vessel to
Newcastle, N. S. W., and there load coal
for this port again than to tie the vessel
np. Favorable winds would bring the
ship back herein time for next season's
shipments of wheat, and in that event the
owners would make expenses and have a,
chance for a profitable year's work at the
end of the run to Europe.
The sealing schooner Kate and Ann is
at anchor in Drakes Bay. Captein Frank
Morrow came to port in order to get a new
boat-steerer for one of the crewÃ. Boat
steerer Cowen was taken sick while out on
a hunt and, gradually growing worse, the
men had to put him back aboard the
schooner. Captain Morrow saw that the
man was very sick, so he ran for Drakes
Bay, where the sick man and the captain
were landed. Cowen was given medical
attendance and Captain Morrow came to
San Francisco to secure another boat
steerer.
When the Kate and Ann headed for
Drakes Bay Hunter Dan Clausen and a
couple of men were out at sea chasing
seals. Clausen had only been married a
few days before the vessel sailed, and
when he saw the schooner heading for
shore and the steamer Arcata headed for
San Francisco he decided to make for
home. He reached here Tuesday, ana will
leave here this morning again with Cap
tain Morrow and Jack Lee for Drakes Bay
to rejoin the sealer. Lee will take the
place of Cowen, who is now on his way to
San Francisco.

Supervisor Dodge Receives
a Visit From a
Milkman.
A Renewal of His Hospital
Contract Worth $1000
to Him.
Was Fr<e With His Money Among
City Officialsâ The Grand Jury
Will Investigate.
Mayor Phelan has addressed a com
munication to Chairman Peixotto of the
Grand Jury calling attention to charges
of attempted bribery which have been
made against Frank Maity, the milkman
who had the contract under the old Board
of Supervisors! >â¢ supplying milt to the
City and County Hospital. The allega
tion as stated in the Mayor's communica
tion is that Marty approached Dr. Wash
ington Dodge, chairman of the Hospital
Committee of the present Board of Super
visors, and certain officers in charge of
public institutions, with a view of cor
ruptly obtaining a renewal of the contract
for supplying milk to the hospital.
Mayor Pheian also calls attention to the
report of the expert, W. D. Griffin, of the
Board of Health, "in which serious alle
gations are made involving fraudulent
contracts to deliver goods and to perform
work."
The Mayor volunteers, when the jury
shall undertake the investigation, to lay
before it certain information that is in his
possession. What that information ia he
refuses to state.
A morning paper is authority for the
statement that Milkman Marty sent a
friend to Dr. Dodtte to give him to under
stand that if the contract were given
again to Marty he (Marty) "would make
it all right" with the doctor. The doctor
refused to listen to such overtures, but a
few days later Marty himself appeared
before Dr. Dodge and in so many words
offered him $1000 as a present if he would
give him the contract for supplying milk
to the Almshouse and City and County
Hospital.
The story went on to say that when
Marty did not get the contract in spite otÂ°
this inducement he went to Superintend
ent Reddy of the AlmshouÂ«e and offered
to give him a regular stated sum of $40 a
month and Ed McClung, the clerk, $20 a
month if by the use of their influence be,
Marty, got tbe contract.
As to the truth of all this Dr. Dodge
will not speak. He said last evening that
it was farthest from his mind to make
any complaint before the Grand Jury
against a "poor devil of a milkman whose
head I myself cut off." The whole mat
ter was extremely annoying to him, he
said, as he had no desire to pose as "Mr.
Honesty come to town."
Colonel McClung being interviewed, said
that there was no tintn in the statement
as to Marty having offered him any money
to recover to him the contract. He said
that shortly after Captain Reddy became
superintendent Marty had offered him a
piece of money as a present and quite as a
matter of course. He seemed to think it
was all right to do bo. There was no con
sideration offered. Captain Reddy de
clined the gift, saying that he (Marty) was
mistaken in the man he had to deal with.
Shortly after that Marty offered him,
McClung, a $5 gold piece in the same
way, wnich, in the same way, was de
clined. There the matter had ended,
Marty appearing quite surprised at en
countering people who refused money
when offered to them. Colonel McClung
said he thought the Dr. Dodge incident
a ltogether likely to have occurred as re
lated.
As Mayor Phelan bas brought the
matter to tt:e attention of the Grand Jury
an investigation will of course be made,
and it is expected that a great deal of
other information along these same lines
will be developed.
There are delivered to the Almshouse
thirty-five cans of milk per day, three
gallons to the can, at 50 cents per can;
there are delivered to the City and County
Hospital twenty-five cans, making sixty
cans or $30 per day â over $900 a month.
This is quite a contract in milk, and
deaiers say that the rate of a fraction
above 4 cents a quart in such quantities
is quite profitable.
Joe King was the chairman of the Hos
pital Committee of the old board, and it
was he who awarded the pontract to
Marty. The price was reduced by Marty
at that time from 60 to 50 cents a can.
King declares that tie "received no $1000
for the contract, either."
Only Hit Kxaimner Story.
Yesterday morning the Examiner printed a
story to 'he effect that Dr. A. H. Glannini and
Dr. Howard Morrow had been dumped out of
a buggy, and that Dr. Glannini . had j his foot
crushed and was confined to his bed. As usual
the story was incorrect. Dr. Giannini says he
was not even out riding with Morrow or any
one else and was not hurt. It was only "an
other Examiner yarn."

Favors.
Strenuous Efforts to Practice

i
The Substitute Teachers' Salaries
Discussed â Many Changes
Recommended.
For nearly three and a half hours last
night the new Board of Education re
solved, amended, argued and made
speeches to the gallery. The first oppor
tunity to make a speech was when the
roll was being called. Director Head in
terrupted by saying:
"I object to the calling of the name of
Dr. D. P. Ragan as a Director of this
board. His right to sit in the delibera
tions of this body is in doubt. At the last
election R. H. Webster was elected Super
intendent of Public Schools. He pre
sented himself for recognition as such,
but his demand for his rights was over
looked and he was obliged to appeal to
the courts, and his case is now in court.
"While the matter stands thus Mr. Bab
cock has no right to act as Superintend
ent de facto and appoint any one to fill
vacancies in the board while his own posi
tion is in question. Therefore, I protest and
ask that Dr. Racan's name be not read, in
tne rollcali."
Chairman Barrington ruled that Mr.
Head's protest was out of order.
One of the principal features of the
evening was a report presented by the
Committee on Janitors, which consists of
Directors Gallagher, Burns and Drucker.
In brief it provided for the dismissal of a
dozen or more women who have been en
gaged in the menial task of keeping the
school buildings tidy, and read as follows:
Resolved, That the following janitors be ap
pointed vice those removed: A. Gault, Poly
technic High School, vice Mrs. Moore; William
Hugh, Rlncon Grammar School, vice Mrs. H.
Heapy; John E. OwenÂ«, Spring Valley Gram
mar, vice A. Ascher; James Cavanagb, Le
Conte Primary, vice Mrs. 8. Gordon;
Mrs. Burns, Douglas Primary, vice Mrs.
R. Breen; P. J. Sullivan, Hamilton
i Grammar, vice Mrs. B. Ross; Catherine
Maguire, Agassiz Primary, vice Mrs, B. Hoff
man; Mrs. Lawton, Crocker Grammar, vice
Mrs. H. A. McAllister; Mrs. Klynn, Girls' Hieh
School, vice Mrs. F. Letts; Mrs. Mahoney, Edi
son Primary, vice Mrs. H. iiomm; John Kear
ney, Longieltow Primary, vice Mrs. M. Clyne;
M.'iliues, Sau Francisco Normal, vice Mrs. 11.
Hanwigsen; A. Ascfaer, Hancock Grammar,
vice Mrs. B. Manning: Mrs. McAuliffe, Whit
tier Primary, vice Mrs. M. Lynch.
This brought Director Head to bis feet,
and pointing to the recommendation of
the committee, he said: 'This is the re
ward for political services. In order to
provide places for big buriy political heei
ers who have done work at the polls and
elsewhere this committee proposes to
throw out upon the cold charity of the
world these women, many of whom are
widows and have little children to support.
1 protest against this board taking such a
step and placing itself on record in any
such manner. No board in the past lias
dared to take such action.''
Mr. Head staled that, in the first place,
he objected to voting on the whole resolu
tion, in which the fate of nearly fifteen
widows was involved, and he called for
each change to be taken up and voted
upon separately. There was a fight against
this course, but it carried. As a result
only three changes were made, and they
were the appointments of John E. Owens,
Catherine Maguire and Mrs. Mahoney.
Directors Bantel, Burns, Gallagher and
Raeran voted solidly ior the appointments
as recommended by the committee.
Director Waller submitted a detailed
statement of actual receipts and expendi
tures from July 1, 1896, to January 1, 1897,
showing a deficit, on the basis of the full
allowance of half of the appropriation, on
January 1, 1897, amounting to $36,865 05.
Adding in the half of teachers' salaries
for November yet due the total deficit on
January 1, 1897, was $74,838 15. He also
submitted a statement of estimated ex
penditures and available funds from Janu
ary 1, 1897, to July 1, 1897, based on actual
ana estimated receipts, showing a total
deficit July 1, 1897, of $124,746 20.
Another long argument having economy
as its basis was called forth by a report in
relation to cutting off the pay of the sub
stitnte teachers, which was as follows:
Your special committee, consisting of Direc
tors Ragau, Head, Derham and Superintend
ent BabcocK, to whom was referred the resolu
tions offered by Director Waller that the un
assigned teachers now doing substitute duty
be added to the day substitute class, and the
suspension of the substitute list below the
number thirty beg leave to report that it has
carefully considered the subject maHer and
reports favorably on the resolution that the
unassigned teachers be placed at the
head of the substitute list and that they be
assigned to the first vacancies in the depart
ment and that it is the sense of the committee
that the substitute list as it now stands is re
quired for the needs of the department and
it is opposed to the suspension of any of the
substitute class.
Tbe resolution was adopted.
P. M. Nolan, chairman of the City Board
of Examination, made the following rec
ommendations:
That Miss Henrietta E. CarviUe be granted a
grammar grade certificate on her California
life diploma of the grammar grade.
That Mrs. Sadie Garvin be granted a gram
mar grade certificate on her California life
diploma of tne grammar prade.
That MiÂ»s Mai Mead Galloway be granted a
grammar grade certificate on her life diploma
of graduation from the San Francisco Normal
class.
That Mrs. Annie McCone Callwell be granted
a grammar-grade certificate on her diploma of
graduation from the San Francisco normal
class.
That Miss Erne F. Grant be granted a gram
mar-grade certificate on her diploma of gradu
ation from the California State Normal school
located at Chico.
That a special bookkeeping certificate of
Miss Maggie McDonald be renewed.
That Miss Louise H. Krauss be recommended
to the State Board oi Education for a State
educational diploma of the grammar grade.
The report was adopted.
The Committee on Classification made
the following recommendations:
That Miss Alice E. Lynch of the Hirst Gram
mar School be transferred to the Webster
Primary School; that Miss F. L. Soule of the
unaÃsigned list of teacaers be assigned to
the Hirst Grammar School; that Miss
F. A. Gilmoro De assigned to the charge
of the class of Miss Cora Gallagher of the
Everett Grammar School, now on leave of ab
sence: that Mrs. Irene Reeves and Miss Henri
etta C. Byrne be appointed High School
substitutes, to be paid only for act*
ual services rendered; that six type
machine typewriters be transferred
from the Polyclinic High School to the Mission
High School; that Miss L. R. Pettigrew of the
uuassigned list of teachers be assigned to the
Third Grade class of the Emerson School;
that Miss Emily Hartrick be trans
ferred from the evening substitute list to

The recommendations were adopted.
The Committee on Rules recommended
that the March vacation be postponed

nival week; also that permission be
granted to the young ladies of the Girls'
High School to have an entertainment
for the benefit of their school library.
The same committee also recommended

TEACHERS AND CONTRACTORS
MAY SUE FOR THEIR BILLS
Ex-President Hyde Says the Auditor Must Pay
Claims.
HE SCORES TWO BOARDS
Says the Last Two Bodies Have
Been Extravagant and
Arbitrary.
CANNOT DIVIDE SCHOOL FUND
The Ex-School Director and Attor
ney Says Mandamus Would 6a
Against the Auditor.
There has been considerable interest in
the status of the public school funds for
several weeks owing to Auditor Brod
erick's statement that there are no avail
able assets with which to pay teachers
their current salaries.
Auditor Broderick's statement seems to
confirm the estimate of Chairman Wal-
Jer of the Finance Committee of the
Board of Education, to the effect that the
department is confronted with a deficit of
about $90,000.
F. A. Hyde, ex president of various
boards of education, has entered the field
as a disputant of nearly all the facts
alleged by Chairman Waller and Auditor
Broderbk,
That the case may appear clear to the
taxpayer, it is well to recur to Auditor
Broderick's figures. His statement ot
the condition of the finances of the de
partment is contained in the following
table:
Appropriation for 1896-97 *1,000.010 00
>or Mission Hieh School 200,000 00
Balance from 1&96-96 41,277 2o
Total $1,VJ41,'277 2b

Total amount available to De
cember 31, 1896 $541,277 25
TpUUamouut audited 660,161 08
Overdraft for the last half of tbe
fiscal year $18,873 85

January 74,000 00

Audited $52.MX) 00
Uii hand not audited... 4,443 45â $56.943 45
Balance $143,056 55
The chief contest in which the Dublic
is concerned is that between the chairman
of the present Finance Committee and the
chairman of the same committee of a for
mer board. The Auditor's statement
seems to confirm the estimate ot Director
Wailer, but F. A. Hyde, former presi
dent of various boards, has different ideas.
In an interview wnh Thb Call yesterday
he said:
The fact Is that none of the figures are cor
rect. The claim of ex-Director Hawley that
there is no deficiency is correct, but his fig
ures in support or the proposition are absurd.
The figures of Waller and Auditor Brodenck
are correct, but they do not support their con
clusions that there is a deficit. The Auditor's
error, which has been accepted by the present
and past Boards of Education, is in settin â¢
aside the sum of $200,000 for the Mission
High School, as a separate fund, not to be
trenched upon except lor that purpose. It it
true that the Board ot Supervisors assumed to
do this, but there is no authority of law there
for. There is put one school fund, and if the
Supervisors can say that $200,000, or any
sum, shall be spent for the erection of a High
School they cau Bay how much the directors
shall spend for slate-pencils, or carpenter
work, or salaries.
The uchool Directors themselves have no
power to divide the school fund. The fund is
responsible for bills of any character in the
order of presentation. The late board re
tained a half month's salary from the teach
ers. The money was in the treasury to pay
them and they were entitled to their money.
I understand that the Auditor has declined to
approve some of the bills contracted by the
late board. In my opinion he has no right to
do it, and if the contractors know their rights
they will get their money before it is used lor
other purposes. Tbe shortage will become ap
parent when the contractors for tbe Mission
High School apply for their money, but as
their demands will not mature during this
fiscal year, there seems to be no reason why
the teachers should not be paid their full
salaries.
While it is true the last Board of
Education employed a great many un
necessary teachers, that is no reason
why ail of them should foot the bills.
But, if the present board refuses to pay the
teachers iheir half-month's salary, which was
withheld by the late board, they can collect it
by law. The same is true of the contractors.
The Auditor must know, for he has been in
office long enough to know, that he has no
right to withhold the payment of any bills
approved by the Board of Educatiouâpro
vided the one-twelfth act is not violated.
The Hoard of Supervisors appropriated
$1,200,000. If, in that appropriation, it was
stated that $200,000 was lor building a Mis
sion High Srhool tuat was only advisory. If,
lollowing out that advice, the Board of Educa
tion chose not to spend the $200,000 for other
Surposes, it could appropriate it to tne Mission
jgh School; but, it the directors contracted
indebtedness in excess of $1,000,000 then the
surplus must come out of the $200,000 fund.
In fact there is but one iund. The Auditor
says that there is at present Â»n overdraft on
the funds of the department of $36,833 96. In
this deficit he does not include the $200,000
of which $100,000 is to the credit of the fund
up to the first of this January, and it leaves.
Instead of a deficit, a considerable fund car
ried over.
It is undoubtedly true that the late board
bought supplies and contracted obligations
that were unnecessary and extravagant, but
that Is no reason why those who have parted
with their goods or furnished labor and mate
rial should not receive their money. They
made their contracts with the Board of Educa
tion, and iheir bills huve been presented and
approved. 1 thiuk that the Auditor knows too
much law to refuse to pay them if they give
him to understand that their claims will be
eniorct'd through the courts.
I see no necessity lor closing the schools, nor
for the teachers losing any portion of their
salaries for the present fiscal year.
THE SEWER BOND ISSUE.
Ki-MÂ»yor Ellert < hinkn That Sewers
Can Be Provided Without Bond*.
Ex-Mayor Ellert says that he believes
that a sewer system can be provided for
dan Francisco without a bond issue, by
providing it gradually. He has long been
of this opinion.
"We were on the right track to accom
plish that when we had the Sewerage
Commission, consisting of Colonel G. H.
Mendell, Professor Davidson, Irving M.
Scott, Marsden Man son and C. Â£. Gran
sky. Bat the politicians got away with
that commission, although I did not
think when the Commissioners were ap
pointed that they would dare to do that.
After that experience, it is doubtful if an
other commission could be appointed on
the same general plan.
â¢*Tue resolution adopted by the Board
of Supervisors calling upon the San Fran
cisco delegation at Sacramento to work
for an act enabling the Supervisors to
submit the question of bonding the City
and County to the people may result in
trying that question out. I bave never
been in .favor of running the City and
County into debt and am opposed to it
now. Still the question will be settled by
the majority if it is submitted, and if the
majority want bonds they will have
them."
PSO&KESS ON SIXTH.
That Street to Have Electric-Cars and
Bitumen.
The merchants on Sixth street are by no
means satisfied with the partial improve
ment bo far made on that street by the
illumination lately added to its attractive
ness.
The prime movers in the improvement
of this street are: H. Wolf, J. F. Swee
ney, L. V. Merle, H. Alsbach, S. Rosen
thai, W. Marks, H. H. Plant and W. A.
Etting. These gentlemen with others will
institute a crusade against the cobbles on
the street, in favor of bitumen. They
will also agitate tor a better car service.
"We want," said H. Wolf, " a line of
cars that will connect us with South San
Francisco by giving transfers at Third and
Townsend at that end of the line, and
also to Market and the cars running to
the Western Addition.
"As far as the City Front and North
Beach is concerned, we understand that
the idea of the Market-street Railroad
Company is to cross Market, go up Taylor
as far as Bush and run down that street
as far as Kearny. wnere it already has a
track that connects with Montgomery and
Sansome. Once there it can run over its
present route to the ferries and up Jack
son to Kearny, where it can transfer to
the cars on that line to the Beach.
"The only thing, as we understand it,
that stops this scheme it that the fran
chise of the Suttar-street road is now be-
fore the Supreme Court wailing for a de
cision. Then we expect to see a move
ment made in this direction."
Tnese ideas of Mr. Wolf are shared by
others and a new era of prosperity is looked
to for the future of Sixth street.
At the next meeting of tbe club all the
real estate owner* will be invited to be
present and to join the club. For, as the
merchants express it, what will benefit
the tenant must assuredly benefit the
property-owners.
Tne following new members were added
to the roll at the meeting on Tuesday
night:
I. S. Cohen, Marks Bros., John F. Sweeney,
L. A. Devoto, Gus Jacobs, Louis Rubenstein, O.

FELL TO HIS DEATH.
A Chinese Plunges Down One
Hundred Feet in the
Palace HoteL
Tried to Get Into a Moving Elevator,
but He Slid Under It Into
the Sbait.
Chin Wah Sing, a Chinese housecleaner
employed in the Palace Hotel, fell down
an elevator shaft yesterday morning and
was killed. It was a shocking accident,
for the distance be fell was from the fifth
floor to the basement, something over 100
feet.
When the Coroner's deputies reached
the place they found Sing lying on a pile
of pipes. Scarcely a bone in his body
escaped unbroken: in fact, the man was
literally crushed by the^ force of the fall.
The accident occurred at the elevator on
the Annie-street side of the building, the
one chiefly used by the servants. The
cage stopped on the fifth floor, going up,
to allow James Casey, a carpenter, to
enter.
When the carpenter was safely inside
Joe Gi ills pie, who was in charge of the
elevator, closed the door. At thai moment
Sing ran to the elevator and seized the
door before! the latch caught, and tnrow
it open sprang for the ascending cage,
which was then about three feet above
the leve! of the floor. In doing so he
slipped and both feet went into the eleva
tor shaft under the car and the iorce of
the fall threw the Chinaman's body into
the shaft. A moment later there was a
sickening crash as the body of the man
landed on the iron pipes over 100 feet
below. From appearances the unfonun
ate fellow must have turned over com
pletely as he went down, for his head was
crashed out of all resemblance to that of a
human being.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
The Two Desperate Prisoners Who Trusted r to the Water Rather
Than to the Deputy Sheriff.
LAST CHANCE FOR
THEIR LIBERTY
Two Manacled Prisoners
Attempt to Swim
Ashore.
They Are Supposed to Be the
Highwaymen Wanted in
Fresno.
Frank Hall and James Wilson Make
Desperate Attempt to Get
Away From a Sheriff.
The early risers who frequent the water
front viewed something out of the ordi
nary shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday
morning, when the Stockton boat reached
her mooring.
Two prisoners, handcuffed, who were in
charge ot Deputy Sheriff W. E. Henry of
Fresno, saw a faint possibility of liberty,
and they availed themselves of it. It was
a forlorn chance, and came near beins
iheir undoing, but they were daring
enough to grasp ai it.
The men are Frank Hall and James
Wilson, who are said to be tbe two hard
est characters who ever visited Fresno
County.
Quite recently no less than twelve peo
ple have been "held up" in Fresno city
within a few days.
Deputy Sheriff Henry and a friend
named L. P. Timmins got a fairly good
description of the men and traced t.eui to
StODfeton. Whiie Henry was on the levee
from which leaves the afternoon boat for
this City on Tuesday he noticed his men
among the passengers. The gang-plans
was about to be hauled in and there was
no time to notify Timmins of the fact.
Henry therefore jumped aboard and
started with the steamer for hub City.
At midnight Henry and the captain of
the vessel placeJ the men under arrest,
handcuffing them for safekeeping. They
pleaded innocence of all crime, as is usual
with their Kind, and behaved quite prop
erly until the steamer neared the dock in
the morning.
At this stage of the trip the prisoners
made a desperate rush for the vessel's side
and clamoered overboard.
They endeavored to swim to the wharf,
but their manacled wrists provea unhandy
and they were almost drowned before a
boat reached them.
They were conveyed to the Receiving
Hospital and put to bed while their
clothes were being dried. At 4 o'clock in
the afternoon Deputy Sheiiffs Henry and
Timmins, who reached here on a later
boat, took the two men back to Stockton.
MANHATTAN AIHLETES-

ern, Roster and Berguram of the San Fran
cisco Turn Verein g:ive a pretty exhibition
on the vaulting horse and parallel bars.

Held to Answer.
Alfred F. Davis, a barber, who shot his
brother-in-law, William F. Healey, in the Mis
sion on New year's morniDg, was yesterday
held by Judge Low to answer before the Su
>Â»erior Court on the charge oi assault to mur
der in $1000 bonds. Healey at one time was
expected to die, but he is now in a fair way to
recover.
Market-Street. Masher.
Joseph Bush, the Maritet-street masher, who
was convicted of vagrancy by Judge Conlan
Tuesday, appeared for sentence yesterday.
i The Judge, after giving him a deserved
scorching, sent him to the County Jail for six
months.
THE MEET OF
THE ENDEAVORERS
W. A. Gillespie Here From
Pennsylvania to Fix Ho
tel Accommodations.
He Estimates That at Least 5000
Eastirn Delegates Wili Come
to This City.
Says It Is Untrue That Philadelphia Is
Alter the Convention â A Great
Meeting Expected X re.
W. A. Gillespie, formerly president of
the Philadelphia Christian Endeavor
Union, comprising 20,000 members, ar
rived here yesterday to arrange for the
reception here of the Pennsylvanians who
will attend the great convention in this
City July 7 next. Mr. Gillespie is accom
panied hy George A. Metzger, also of
Philadelphia.
He Â«ays about 350 mem bers of the Chris
tian Endeavor from Pennsylvania have
arranged witn him to come here. Besides
tbeni in the same party will be 100 or 125
from Washington, D. C.
"The rates are fixed," said Mr. Gillespie.
"They will be $50 from Chicago for the
round trip, and about $63 lrom Philadel
phia. We will come by way of Chicago,
stopping there for half a day, at Denver
one day, Manitou a day. Glen wood Springs
pan of a day, and Salt Lake over Sunday.
"My object in coming was to arrange
for stopping over at those places and for
hotel accommodations here. The matter
of our transportation has been already
fixed.
"Philadelphia is not a possibility In con
nection with this convention, notwith
standing >c r ecent dispatch mat claimed
that City was in the field for it. To begin
with it does not want it. It isn't ready
for it, and if it did want it it would take
a year to get ready.
"I think at least 5000 will attend the
convention from the East, and I will be
disappointed if there are not 15,000 as a
whole here. The largest conveu tion ever
held was in Boston, with 56,000 registered
delegates and 70,000 delegate' as a whole.
Many uf them did not register.
"The convention at Washington last year
had 41,000 registered delegates. The vari
ous Stales East, so far as I am informed,
are expecting to come ht-re in large forces.
â¢"Corning by the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific we will return by way of Port
land, the Northern Pacific and Yellow
stone Park. We win come on special
Pullman trains, composed of the finest
modern cars. There will be two or three
of the trains required to carry the Penn
sylvania and Washington delegations.
"Our date of leaving Philadelphia will
be June 28, and we expect to be absent
just a month.
"The Pennsylvania State Endeavor
Union is the largest in the world. It has
over 4000 societies and over 200,000 mem
bers."
Messrs. Gillespie and Metzear will be here
but two days, and will then go to Los An
geles. Returning here they will go home
via Oregon.
POINT LOBOS OLUB.
Favors an Increase in the Fay of Fire-
men and Police.
- At the meeting ot the Point Lobos Im
provement Club Tuesday a special com
mittee on transfers on the cross streets re
ported it had succeeded in getting trans
fers to and from the Fillmore-street line
after the Ist of February. For this con
cession a vote of thanks was tendered the
committee.
A report was received from the com
mittee appointed to induce 'he Oiynipic
Salt Water Company to put sidewalks in
front of its property on Point Lobos
avenue, with the assurance that this
much-desired accommodation would be
complied with.
A resolution was introduced instructing
Presidenr Fletcher, now at Sacramento,
to advocate the bill now befote the Legis
lature increasing the pay of the chief and
captains of the San Francisco police.
An amendment wet offered to this reso
lution advocating an increase in the pay
of the chief ot the Fire Department to
$6000, assistant chief $3000. secretary $3000
and district engineers to $2100. Both were
carried unanimously.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
BURGLARS HAD IT
THEIR OWN WAY
They Looted the Scott-Street
Home of Samuel
J. Allen.
Diamonds and a Quantity oi
Valuable Jewelry Was
Secured.
The Po ice Have Been Notifi d About
Two Suspicious Characters Who
May Have Done the Jcb.
The residence of Samuel J. Allen, a
weigher in the employ of Dunsmuir &
Co., the great coal importers, was selected
as a choice bit of household to enter and
plunder last Monday morning.
Tbis quiet little home is a six-room flat
at 412 Scott street, within a few doors of
Oak.
Mrs. Allen and her daughter left their
home on Saturday afternoon for a pro
tracted trip into the country. The hus
band and father would have followed in a
lew days but for the fact that he was noti
fied by the police that the house had been
plundered. He immediately recalled his
family and they have been looking over
the place ever since discovering the ab
sence of additional articles of value.
The Aliens' flat is an upper one of a
new style of building. The bathroom
opens up both -on the back porch facing
the East and into the kitchen through
which admission is obtained by a sliding
door.
About 2 o'clock in the morning of Mon
day, the French inaiU of Mrs Curry, who
iiveÃ in the lower flat, heard some noise
in me story overhead. She knew that
Mr. Allen's family had gone away to the
country and she suspected that burglars
were at work.
Her suspicion was strong enough to
make her hide her face beneath the
blankets and await results with fear and
trembling.
Monday afternoon she became courage
ousenongh to climb tue steps to the upper
flat, so as to hang up her washing, and
she discovered that the bathroom door
leading into the flat had been broken into
by burglars, who had looted the place.
She immediately informed the lad in tne
corner grocery-store, who in turn told all
about it to me police. The latter, there
fore, are in search ol the burglars, who
are supposed to be two "suspicious char
acters" wno have been loitering about the
neighborhood for the past ten days.
The burglars managed 10 pick the two
locks from the outside door to the kitchen.
In the bedroom they secured a valuable
pair of marine classes, two choice razors,
a diamond snirt stud, one c.imeo ring, a
microscope and a lady's diamond-studded
'spider^' brooch. Tney were frightened
away, no doubt, as they left several purses
of coins, silver and gold, that Mrs. Allen
bad been collecting as souvenirs of her
European travels. Other pieces of jewelry
and the silverware were also overlooked.
RAILROAD BOOKKEEPING
Action on a Uniform System
Temporarily Postponed by
the Commission.
Small Transpor a o.i Lines Will Be
Rv quired to Present Their
Tar.ffi
The Railroad Commission did nothing
of vast importance or interest to the pub
lic at its regular meeting yesterday after
noon.
Communications were read by Secretary
Newman from various railroads in regard
to making a report of every tariff to the
cemmission, and in regard to a uniform
system of bookkeeping which, it was pro
posed, all the railroads of the State shou'd
adopt. The replies on these matters have
been published and are in the biennial re
port recently distributed. As to tariffs,
many small railroads and other transpor
tation companies of the State replied,
in brief, tnat they carried no passengers
and no freight outside their own private
business, which business was, in most in
stances, stated to be that of logging or
lumbering in their own camps, or for their
own mills, and that they had no tariffs of
any nature to submit.
The reading of these communications
bron ht out some discussion In regard to
tariffs and charges made by stage lines
and small steamboats on inland lakes.
The opinion was expressed by Chairman
La Rue and Commissioner Stanton that
the small transportation companies of
this kind also come within the province
of the commission, and the resuit will be
that the secretary will communicate with
as many of them as he can find.
The replies in regard to uniform book
keeping showed, with some few excep
tions, a general disposition to acquiesce
and fall into line. Where suggestions
were made by the companies they were to
the effect that the interstate commerce
system be adopted. No action was taken.
A communication dated Montreal, from
the "Canadian Inquiry Into Transporta
tion Charges on Farm Products," was
read. It asked for the tariffs in this State
ou a variety of things from milk to bop
poles. The secretary will give what in
formation he has.
After the meeting adjourned Commis
sioner Stanton was asked concerning the
bringing up before the board again of the
commission's right and duty under the
constitution of proceeding to make an in
vestigation of rates and charges and
â bonds on its own hook, under its constitu
tional authority. Nothing toward an in
dependent investigation will be done at
present.
Populists on Bills.
The executive committee of the People's
party met at their headquarters in the Murphy
building on Saturday, January 23, and or
ganized by electing J. A. Anthony chairman
and T. H. Hatch secretary. Resolutions were
adopted in favor of the bill before the Legis
lature for the government of employment
agencies and also for an amendment to the
constitution in relation to the incarceration
of children for seeking alms on the street
Resolutions were also passed against the Loud
Postal bill.
Salomon Wag Convicted.
Some days ago Officer Butterworth and Meat
Inspector Ben Davis of the Health Depart
ment arrested J. L. Salomon for causing the
butchering of a diseased cow on the San
Bruno roiid Yesterday Salomon was found
guilty by Judge Low. Sentence was deferred.

A journeyman barber in Cincinnati, a specially intelligent man and
a favorite with his patrons, says of "
" I want to say that for eight months I have taken three a day and
have ; not been to see a doctor once since I commenced to take them. â  ,
â¢Znl w ? u ' d u V S to have a big tube put down my throat and have
my stomach flushed (I believe that is what they call it) three times
every week by a doctor; that charged me 50 cents for every time.
,Of course, that gave me relief, but the trouble always came back
again, and I can tell you it was no fun to be pumped out about every
two days. The doctor said I had catarrh of the stomach. Whatever it
was, it don t bother me now. For four years I was troubled so that I
used to lose about three days out of every month.V When this barbsr

him with a Tabule. and \ if taken it removes the difficulty forthwith. V

Henry E. Highton Lectures
in Metropolitan
Temple.
Describes the Growth of Reli
gious Toleration in
America.
No Consolidation of Church and State
is Possible Unier the Con
stitution.
In Metropolitan Temple last night Hon.
Henry E. Highton delivered an instruct
ive lecture entitled "The True Basis of
American Citizenship," under the anÂ»
pices of Golden Gate Council No. 84, Y.
M. I.
The lecture was preceded by s short pro
gramme, to which the Sacred Heart
Orchestra, under the direction of Prof.
Karl Shernslein, and George W. Colvert,
a humorous elocutionist, agreeably con
tri bated.
The president of the evening, Samuel
Haskins, spoke briefly ia anticipation of
(>'r. Highton's subject. HÂ«s claimed for
the Catholic church an attitude of respect
toward the civil authority of tbe State,
though as a church it is not identified
with any one form of government. "To
us," taid he, "the stars and stripes is the
symbol of our political and religious
liberty. We shall see that it flies higa
and that it flies forever." Mr. Highton
continued:
The centuries of persecution in the name of
religion have ended, and those persecutions
themselves nave been grossly misconceived.
They have been attributed by atheists, by
skeptics, by agnostics, by scientists, to religion
itself, whereas they arose, wherever they ex
isted, from the incessant struggle of bar
barism, through undeveloped humanity,
against the teachings oi religion. Religious
wars, so-called, class and individual contro
versies originated in these struggles. But the
entire world has outgrown the barbarism of
force* Fanaticism, bijrotry, intolerance, in
their political application represent the vices
and not the virtues of man. They were
the very elements which it was the province
and tbe function of religion finally to extir
pate.
When the Government of the United States
was firmed in theory at least fratricidal con
tests in the name of religion, upon this conti
nent and wherever our institutions prevailed,
were over. They are now substantially ended
In fact. The American people having under
gone the throes of birth and the vicissitudes
of cbildnood and adolescence are now studying
their own institutions and exploring their
origin, their framework and their progress
amidst all setbacks and temporary tailures,
with reference to the present evils with which
they hare to contend and the future to which
they aspire.
Mr. Highton spoke of the duty of every
citizen to withstand every disintegrating
influence and to hold the Government and
its administration where the fathers
placed it. He anticipated his conclusion
when be described the true basis of Ameri
can citrzensbip as a moral basis â the
recognition of the sovereignty of a per
sonal God and tbe brotherhood of man,
botn denned and expressed in the moral
law.
The lecturer proceeded to illustrate his
Rneurrient by tbe facts of history, dividing
thesÂ« info three epochs, viz.: (1)' from
M 1492-1607; (2) from 1607-1787; and (3) from
I 1737-1897. ite outlined clearly and suc
cinctly tbe process of colonization in the
various States of the sub-equent Union,
and quoted the terms of their charters,
showing that both the discovery and
colonization of America were undertaken
in the spirit of religion.
The Spanish alone, and they were a
Catholic people, established nine distinct
Governments in North and South
America, while Canada from 1635, when
Cartier first settled there, till 1759, when
therlSnelish tooJc possession, was a French
province, and when tbe transfer was made
the Catholics were secure ia the free ex
ercise of their religion. He dwelt at some
length upon the position occupied by Vir
ginia in the early seventeenth century,
when Sir William Burke saw fit to thank
God for the absence of free schools ana
printers.
The charter of Massachusetts provided
a certain measure of religious toleration,
while in New Hampshire the principle of
representation was recognized as e;irly as
November, 1629. Rhode Island provides a
charter indicating the beginnings of free
dom, and independence in tbe modern
sense of the term. In the Catholic colony
of Maryland religious liberty was estab- i
lisluti as tua fundamental law, and in
New York liberty of conscience was I
granted to settlers. New Jersey, Pennsyl- I
vania. North and South Carolina were j
likewise spe'ified.
The constitution of the two last named
was'framed by the great John Locke and
provided that no man was to be a free
man who did not acknowledge the exist
ence o; God and the fact thai he ought to
be publicly worshiped.
Mr. Highton referred to the noble work
accomplished by Catholic missionaries
and explorers, and added that to all these
early settlers â to the Puritan, the Cava
lier, the Catholic, the Trinitarian, to those
of the moat diverse and conflicting opin
ions, was the one great central recogni
tion of the personal God and a moral force
as the basis of his sovereignty and pa
ternity among mankind.
He devoted attention to the provisions
of the Americau constitution respecting
A religious liberty, emphasizing the fact
that in these the State is create**listinct
aid separate from the church and that
there can be no possibility of their con
solidation so long as these provisions are
adhered to.
His closing periods dealt with the de
parture of iacts from theory and of the
corruption which American political prac
tice'has developed. Mr. Highton also
contended that the genius of our constitu
tion should properly exclude and does
exclude tbe pagan and idolator, such as
the Chinese are known to be.
KENNY'S STRANGE CASE.
He Is Supposed to Have Been
Knocked Senseless and
Robbed.
Patrick Kenny, an old man, is in^a
padded cell in the Receiving Hospital
with his mind unbalanced, and there 13 a
strong suspicion that foul play has had
much to do with his unfortunate condi
tion, mentally and otherwise.
Kenny is an old soldier, and for 18 years
was on the quaitermaster's staff at Van
couver, B. C, his son now occupying the
position ha held.
7 About three weeks ago he came to this
I City from Vancouver with the intention
\ of procuring a suitable place for his wife
* and daughter.
On his arrival he called upon Sear's &
FoJey, saloon-keepers, East and Washing
ton streeu, who were old friends of his,
and they mocured a room for him. Two
or three days later he went to the General
Postoffice 10 cash an order and told Sears
mnd Foley that he would go to the Pre
iidio to see an old friend.
The old man was well dressed and had
Tfie Messenger Boys Formed a Circle and Gave Mrs. Stanford Three Rousing Cheers*
some money in his pockets besides what
he would receive for the Postoffice order.
He did not call upon any one at tbe Pre
sidio and nothing was heard of him for
several days.
On Wednesday, January 13, he was
found wandering around the streets in the
BOutMern part of the City, and he appeared
to be demented. He could tell his name,
but nothing would convince him that he
was not in Vancouver.
He was dressed in an old suit of clothes
and wore a pair of old brogans. There
was no money in his pockets, and there
was an ugiy scar on his forehead which
bad not quite healed.
January 15 he was taken before the
Insanity Commissioners and sent to the
Almahouse. He remained there for about
a week and then wandered away.
Sunday last he was iound wandering
along Suiter street and was sent to the
Receiving Hospital. K^nny has no recol
lection whatever of being in this City, and
it is impossible to get any statement from
htm. Ie is supposed that he had been
decoyed Into some den, where he was
knocked down and robbed oi his money,
clothing and boots, and after a few days
was cast adrift in the old suit.
He was perfectly sane when he arrived
here, and it is believed that the blow on
the forehead has affected his brain.
BURGLARS TREMBLE.
Judge Carroll Cook Will Sentence
Them to Twenty-Five Years'
Imprisonment.
Judge Carroli Cook yesterday sentenced
J. A. Jensen to twenty-nv6 years in the
MR. AND MRS. WILLIAM A. WHITTIER (Formerly Miss
Elizabeth Carroll), Whose Wedding Was One of Three
Which Took Place in Society Last Evening.
State prison for burglary, and intimated
that this would be the limit for such male
factors as are convicted in his court of
burglary in private residences. .
Judge Cook makes .a distinction in cases
where a burglar merely enters a store or
other unoccupied building for the purpose
of obtaining plunder. That course, while
it is highly reprehensible and ought to be
met with proper punishment, does not
call for the extreme penalty. The court
holds that the lives of peaceable citizens
are endangered when a burglar niters a
private residence, for he goes there pre
pared to do mnrder'in the event of re
sistance being offered to him in his depre
dations.
Another point to which Judge Cook
directed attention was the patent perjury
tnat had been committed by the delend
ant in the present case. He said that
hereafter witnesses would be held to a
strict accountability, and that he would
cause the immediate arrest of all witnesses
who testified falsely in his hearing, even
if it took most of his time to try the per
jury charges.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1597.
SIX HEARTS THAT
BEAT AS THREE
William R. Whittier Weds
Miss Elizabeth
Carroll.
Nnptials of Miss Martha Shain
wald and Leopold
Meyer.
Er. Vcorsanger Presides at the M-r
--nage (f Dr. Sharp and Miss
Rose Eppinger.
In spite of the rain and altogether disa
greeable weather yesterday we'ddin bells
rang out merrily and, all superstitions to
the contrary, time happy young couples
liave a bright and joyous future before
them.
At noon Miss Elizabeth Carroll, daugh
ter of Mrs. K. T. Carroll, and William
Robinson Whittier, son of F. W. Wbittier,
were married, Archbishop Kiordan offici
ating.
The limited accommodations of the Car
roll residence made a small wedding im
perative, consequently, though the bride
for the past few seasons has been one of
the most popular of belles and the groom
is a much sougtit after beau and club
man, it was necessary to limit the invita
tions to relatives and most intimate
friends.
In spite of the limited number of in
vited guests the arrangements for the
-wedding were elaborate in the extreme.
The decorations certainly were the most
artistic and beautiful that ever graced a
San Francisco bridal. They consisted en
tirely of huge branches heavily laden with
golden oranges and the fragrant orange
blossoms. The effect was indescribably
beautiful, and combined with the heavy
fragrance of the blossoms the rooms
looked like some bit of enchanted forest.
Tbe gown of the bride was beautiful and
delightfully simple. It was of whue
satin, completely shrouded in fluffy white
tulle. Sprays of natural orange blossoms
were caught around the hem of the skirt
and fastened in the fleecy folds of the
veil. There was no lace on the govrn and
no jewels were worn. The bridal bouquet
was composed of white hyacinths and
lilies oi the valley.
Miss Gertrude Carroll, who officiated as
maid of honor, wore a dainty girlish gown
of whito mousseline de so c, trimmed
with innumerable tiny littie flounces and
narrow lace insertions. She carried a
"Trilby" bouquet of lilies.
The bridesmaids. Miss Julia Crocker
and Miss Romie Wallace, were attired
alike in pale yellow tulle over yellow
satin. A girdle of yellow satin spanned
the waist. They carried bouquets of jon
quils.
Mrs. Carroll, mother of the bride, wore
an elaborate gowu of black velvet. The
corsage was trimmed with costly white
point.
Mi 33 Mattie Whittier, sister of the
proom, wore an elegant gown of white
siik and cerise velvet.
Mrs. Bothin wore an elegant black bro
caded si.k trimmed with rare old laces.
The bride presented her attendants with
dainty pearl and diamond heart-shaped
brooches as souvenirs. Tbe groom gave his
lest man, Milton Latham, a diamond
lleur de its scarf pin.
Many elegant and costly presents of
siiver, crystal and rare works of art were
received. Mr. and Mrs. Whittier left yes
terday afternoon for General Murphy's
ranch in San Luis Obispo, where two
weeks of the honeymoon will be spent.
They will then leave for a rive months'
European tour.
Miss Martha Sbainwald, sister of Her
man Sham wald, the well-known real es
tate man, and Leopold Meyer, a mining
man of New Zealand, were married last
evening at 8:45 o'clock, at the Colonial,
where the bride has made her home for
the past year.
The cerrraony, which was performed by
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger, was witnessed only
by relatives. There were no bridal at
tendants.
A rjeeption followed the ceremony for
which 200 invitations were issued. The
newly wedded couple stood in a bower of
pink Japanese fruit blossoms, from which
hung a wreath of pussywillow and true
lovers' knots, filled with roses and daffo
dils. The bride's gown was of white tulle
over satin and trimmed with point lace.
Mr. and Mrs. Merer will make their
future home in New Zealand.
One hundred invited guests witnessed
the ceremony which united Dr. James
Graham Sharp and Miss Ruse Kppinger.
The wedding was celebrated at the resi
dence of the bride's parents on Octavia
street. Rev. Dr. Voorsanger read the
words which.made the happy couple one.
Miss Julia Eppinger, sister of the bride,
was maid of honor, and Dr. William
Sharp was best man.
It was a white and green wedding.
Eucalyptus, huckleberry blossoms and
papyrus were effectively used in the
ecoration ot the home. The bride's gown
was of white tulle over white satin. The
corsage was trimmed -with duchesse and
point. The maid of honor wore a charm
ing dress of white taffeta and Brussels
net.
Dr. and Mrs. Sharp will leave to-day for
a honeymoon trip, keeping their destina
tion a secret. On their return they will
reside at 2315 California street.

Mrs. Stanford showed that she was
delighted, and w en Corcoran, an Ameri
can District messenger, sat down at a
piano and began playing "Sweet Rosie
O Grady" and to -ing the song she seemed
p riecily happy that her guests felt thor
oughly at home. One popuiar song fol
lowed anotherand ihe boys joined in with
out regard to vocal quali;y.
Before leaving they formed in ,a circle in
the broad main hall and gave tbe Stanford
University yell, lollowed by three rousing
cheers for Mrs. Stanford.
Mrs. Stanford toM them that it had
given her more pleasure to receive them
than it could give them to be received,
and if all should be spared until next year
she would repeat the reception or vary the
entertainment. She said tnat they put
her in mind of her own little boy, who
was about their a^e when be was taken
from her. Sue told them that she hoped
they would all aspire to something high,
and bear in mind that wnh a free univer
sity education with reach no position is
impossible to the ambitious boy.
Henry Beck, manager of the American
District Telegraph Company, who acied
as general escort to the boys, made a little
speech on their behalf thanking Mrs.
Stanford for the pleasure they had had.
As each boy was leaving the bouse he
was given a large package of cake and
cookies to carry away witti him.

THAT PARK INQUIRY.
The Committee of the Old Grand Jury
Keporta to the New Body.
The park committee of the late Grand
Jury appeared before the present Grand
Jury, at it 3 session yesterday, and laid be
fore it a report concerning its investiga
tion of certain financial transactions by
the Park Commission. The committee of
the old Grand Jury was composed of C. C.
Burr, Will Ashe and J. C. Nealon. They
were given full opportunity to elaborate
upon their report, no other business being
taken up during the afternoon. The re
port itself is not a big document, and con
tains nothing that has not already been
published.
The committee of the present Grand
Jury numbers three â M. P. Frogley (chair
man), P. 0. Ahem and W. N. Bruntâ but
will toe enlarged to take up the matters
complained of and a thorough investiga
tion will be made.
Chairman Peixotto says he is convinced
from what he has heard that there has
been no intentional wrong in the conduct
of the affairs of the park. If there has
been anything to which exception may
be taken it has grown out of lapses of
vigilance in the many financial transac
tions. However, he says, the whole
matter will be looked into closely.

Cuvee) is unsurpassed in quality, dryness

Explanation.
The arrow Dies with the wind. The top 13 jn ret
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; .those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid I
lines, connec rom s of equal air pressure; iso- I
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means hit;h barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usi.ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable: j
but when the "low is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, ralu south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder I
weathor In winter. The reverse of these condition! |
â¢rill produce an opposite result.

MEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 27.-Speculatlon at the
Stock Exchange was lifeless a-rain to-day. Here
and there, owing- to special causes, some wide
changes were noted, but the majori y of the usual
ly active Issues dragged along in a listless way.
A feature of tbe session was the depression in the
Hocking Valley securities, the common falling 2:-,
to 7, the lowest figure yet reached. The consoli
dated fives dropped 8 1 i to 68 and the general fives
6 to 63, the foimer subsequently ra lying to 70%
and the stock to By a . The break was due mainly
to forced sales of securities held in loans. Reports
of a receivership could not be confirmed, although
the rumor was again widely circulated. In Feb
ruary and March the company has interest charts
of about $300,000 to meet.
In consequence tho effort of the managers ofthe
bituminous roads to settle their differences aDd
res>oie rates Is anxiously awaited. The Ohio soft
cat roads were in session at Columbus. Ohio, tc
day, but up to the close nothing of a definite char
acter could be obtained. The anthracite coaers
were also heavy at times: Delaware and Hudson
and Lackawanna were pressed for sale on fears of
unfavorable annual r -ports. The first-named
company submitted its statements for tbe year
ended December 31, 1*96. lust near the close. It
showed a loss of net earnings of 1590,243 and a de
ficit of $684,983. Jn 1895 the deficit was 9851,
--606. Dividend* earned last year were a fraction
over 5 per cent, against 6% In 1895. In both
years 7 per cent was paid to me stockholders.
The Lf ckawauna report will come later in the
week, and the best information is that this com
pany will also make a poor showing. The market
was not specially influenced by the heaviness of
the coal properties, and held tolerably firm until
the pub ication of the Delaware and Hudson re
. port, when a slightly weaker tone was noticeable.
â  At one lime the grangers showed a tendency to
cut aloof from the g neral market, tbe December
statement of the St. Paul having exceeded the ex
pectations of the bulls. For the period named thÂ«
road reported a gain in net clearings of 94148. It
was said that the Burlington report for the same
month will also show a slight increase In net
. earnings. This statement is looked for. - Outside
of issues named, them was nothing In the market
to call for special comment. Commisslor.-house
business continued dull, whi.e London operators
cut no figure whatever in the dealings. '
Speculation cosed quiet. ' Net changes show loss
Of 14 to . 1% per cent, the latter In Delaware and
Hudson, Long Island alvanced 'i per cent to 46

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. In,, Jan. 27.â Wheat was in a com
pletely demoralized and panicky condition this
morning. Openiug at thÂ« '-Puts" prices dropped
without hindrance until 76% c tor May was
reached, where a little demand seemed to spring
up. and a moderate rally then took place. Com
mission houses were heavy se.lers, tnelr sales rep
resenting pyramids built se\ eral months ago.
The bears were merciless In taeir selling, many
remembering the chastisement they received in
the bulte which look place during the latter part
of I^-96. Liverpool gave unqualified recognition
to our weakness o yesterday, declining from 1%
@'.'i4d. Snow was raported throughout the West,
w in. v was of vast lmportancj to the new crop.
Receipts a Chicago were 35 earn, and bi, -16
bushelt were taken from store. Ihe Northwest
had l<2cars against SIX lav Wedneslay and 441
a year ago. Closing Continental cablet were

bushels. May wheat opened : rom 77c to 76Vic.

ClOiiDK at 855/ B Â®H45, B C.
CÂ«>RN â The corn market was neglecred, all
speculative attention being centered In wheat.
Business was slower than usual an! piice fluctua
tions were narrow, reflecting in ibe;r direction the
depressed condition of wheat. Receipts were 148
can. and 68 840 bushels were taken from store.
Llverpoo cab es were i/^d lower. Export clear
ances amounted to 394. iB9 busnels. Wbeu wheat
rallied corn showed a disposition to advance. May
corn ooened at 2.^5%c : sold between that price and
2 3%<&24c, closing at the latter. ig<gÂ»i/4C higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts lor to-mo -
row 234 carÂ«.
OATSâ What was true of corn was applicable to
ous. They were dull and a.mosi neglected, with
the little trading there was Indicating nothing
other than sympathy with oth-r markets. Re
ceipts were 166 tars. There were no withdrawals
from sture Exports amounted to 186.032 busti
els. May closed V*c higher. Estimated receipts
for 10 morrow 130 cars.

ket was a little firmer.. T be hog market afforded
no strength, nor did grain, but there was some
demand from packers and that served to sin: am
1 prices easiW. Later. wuÂ«n a very weak feeling
was reported In hogs, the product market eas d
off, closing "ViCailOc lower for May pork and So i

UNION STOCKYARDS. 111.. Jan. 27.-About
'.'9,000 head of cattle hive arrived here during the
I first half of the week as compared with 32,611 for
the same portion of lav. week and 30,335 for the
corresponding perioJ in 1890. Since Monday the I
recfiip s have been light and have b?en running
behind other weeks Today with an estimated
ran of 10,000 in .'re was an active demand at gen
erally stronger {trices, and deslra . lo.s sold at
about 10 cents per 100 pounds higher. Butch
ers' stuff and feeders shared in t be rise. The cold
we-uticr Is cutting down the marketing of hots
very material, v, aud trie receipts are falling far
below recent wee<s. Barely 86.000 ho^s have
arrived during the past tnreÂ» days against 125.400
for the same period last wesic, 70,703 a year ago
ana 89,8 HO two years ago. Packers are not buy

[ from day to day. - Trade was rather animated to
j day, the feelln? Nt first bring stoady, but trie close

the receipts or sheep for th first half of the we.'k

LIBERTY'S DEBT
Lectures at Length on
"What Freedom Owes
to Rome."
A Claim That Prosperity Has
Followed in the Steps of
Protestantism.
Asserts That the Reman Cathorc
Peps Is "Foreign and Un-
American to the Core "
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27.â The First
Presbyterian Church was packed to-night,
the large crowd being attracted by the an
nouncement that Rev. R. -F. Coyle, D.D.,
was to lecture on "What Liberty Owes to
Rome." He said in brief:
I am not here to-night to indulge in person
alities or to call in question the integrity of
individuals. From first to last I must be
understood as dealing with the Papacy as a
system, or an institution, and not with those
who belong to the rank and file of the Romish
/r jrcn. If my words cut, it will be with the
i edge of :ruth and not because of any
jL-r.-onai malice toward my fellowmen who
oiffer from me in religious faith.
The belief is strong in us that Protestantism
has cut something of a figure in the world as
the friend and advocate of liberty. Either we
have read or we have heard that ii not the
author of liberty it created the atmosphere in
whrch -liberty has flourished. Unless we have
been altogether deceived from the very edge
of the dark, Rges, in field and forum, iv pulpit
and proiebsor's chair, iv church and state,
Protestantism has been liberty's unceasing
and undauuted champion. Its children have
poured out ttieir bluod like water to keep
hberty'sbanuers in the sky.
Wherever it has found its way freedom and
prosperity have followed. Look around the
world, go over the map of the globe, pick out
the bright spots, and see if without exception
they are not places lit up by Protestantism.
Protestantism is not infallible, and it has
never blasphemed God by any such monstrous
claim. It has made mistakes. It has some
times been intolerant and narrow and bigoted,
and its emancipation has not fully come yet
It has burned and killed and persecuted. It
has its fanatics and blood-thirsty advocates,
and he is no frieud of Protestantism who fills
its flaws and cracks and ugly places with
putty, and then varnishes them over to make
it look sound and beautiful.
Let in tbe light, all the light possible, no
matter what biack and vile things it may re
veal. Cover up nothing, open your schools,
open your institutions, open your histories to
the sunlight of truth and the inspection of I
the world, that Is the spirit of Protestantism. }
It makes no apologies for its bigotries and
thumbscrews. Ii is ashamed of them. It hangs
its head as it reads the story. But after the
very worst ha 3 been said, after every damaging
Hem has been brought out into light, there is
still left a tremendous balance against the
Papacy.
Ihe speaker at the Macdonough Theater de
clared the other night that while "She (that is
Rome) had supreme power there was no suun
thiug as a despot known in Christendom." If
this conduct of Alexander 111 was not despot-
Ism what was it ? The fact that Rome swal
lowed up all despotisms in herself did not rid
the world of the tyrant's heel, but only made
it the heavier. I refer to this because that foot
on the neck of the German Emperor was typi
caL It stood for spirit. It was Papal doctrine
made flesh. It was Popish authority at its
highest and proclamed the subordination of
Caesar to Peter; of the state to the church; of
th-e civil power to the Papacy.
Now let us follow the course of freedom over
. as and uoie how greatly it has been en
.raged by Rome on this Western hemi
.-jihere, The deiendera of the Papacy say to
us: "Look at the early Maryland colony it you
want evidence that Home is the friend of lib
eriy. Lord Baltimore obtained a charter in
1632 which provided complete toleration;
that, no preference should be given to any
stct, but mat all settlers in the colony should
enjoy equality ot religious rights." All o!
which is true, but, as in the matter of the
Magna Charta, it is a long way from being the
whole Truth.
Whatsoever there was done in the colony of
Maryland in favor of religious toleration was
done only in obedience to the charter and
p.gainst the known and steady policy both of
the Church ol Rome and the Jesuits. Nobody
can justify the intolerance of the Episcopnlians
oi Virginia or the Puritans of New England,
and while we may now congratulate ourselves
that counteracting influences were planted in
Maryland, It should not be forgoiten that those
who brought them accepted toleration from
compulsion and employed all the arts and
cunning of Jesuitism to get rid of it. Intoler
ance, it Is true, accorded with the spirit of
that age and some allowance, but no apology,
is|to be made fur it on that account. But the
first influences that set in against it were
Protestant .exclusively, not Roman Catholic.
Nowhere in the Roman Catholic world could
religious toleration obtain a foothold.
Although great men and laymen of the church
gave it their support, Rome would not permit
it, and her fiat was the law of the church.
"When Rome has spoken," said Augustine,
"that is the end of the matter."
Ladies and gentlemen, the ruling power of
the Roman Catholic Church is foreign and un-
American to the core. Foreign, I mean in
temper and sympathy. Its Pope is foreign, its
colleger of cardinals Is foreign, iv apostolic
legate is foreign, a great multitude of its
priests and teachers are foreign and a very
large 'proportion of its increase comes from
foreign emigration. It is founded not upon
the people, but upon the monarchical princi
ple, th.c absolute supremacy of the Roman
Pontiff and therefore cannot in its inmost soul
be lriendly to a republic. Against foreign
influence Washington warned his country
men to be on their guard in his farewell ad
dress, and, fellowmen, this foreign influence
has come. It is here masquerading behind
the stars and stripes, bubbling over with
mock patriotism, sbowine its loyalty in loud
est terms in order the better to get in its
wort Its 'oft-proclaimed fealty to our insti
tutions and its sudden love for "Old Glory"
have adecidedly Jesuitical look.

Traded in Runaway Lads.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27.â Several
youug lads of West Oakland, whose
library consists of a few dime novels, have
lately run away and caused tneir parents
and the police some anxiety.
It is now stated tbat Albert Ward, a
voting fellow of 14 years, who lives in
West Oakland, has been making a busi
ness of inducing t!ie little fellows to leave
home and then taking a reward from their
parents for finding them. Three young
fellows have disappeared within the last
week, and Ward, who is borne on parole
from Whittier, is charged by the parents
with being responsible for their absence.
Italian Confidence Men.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27. â Three
Italian confidence men are in the County

it. They worked the gripsack trick on
him to procure his money, but were all

does not intend to allow himself to rest
under the stigma laid on him by Rev. Mr.
Bolton of Ban Francisco.
Mr. Law touched up the subject in dis
pute to-day in the following philippic:
Nothing has been farther from my intention
than to engage in personalities in talking
about that most sacred of subjects, the Lord's
supper, nor to treat it lightly, and I utterly
repudiate the polite innuendo of Mr. Bolton
that I have done so. At the same time there
is such a thing as Deing overnice iv phrase
ology and so obscure in the use of technical
language that people are at a complete loss to
know whether one holds to a certain position
or its diametrical opposite. In the words of a
Jingle, which all will see the force of. some
writers and speakers
Wire in then wire out.
And leave the people still In doubt
w nether the thing that made the track
Was coming out or going back.
One expression which the printer made me
say of Mr. Boiton was not correct and 1 hasten
to point it out:
"Not content to compel his communicants
to drink from a common cup, where they are
brought in contact with unclean lives and
possibly contagion, he uses his own lips to
cleanse the rim of the chalice."
Substitute the word "lips" for "lives" and
you will have what I did say. The hostess
says, "Bring a clean glass for Mr. Bolton," and
before Mr. Bolton has a glass of water the
waiter takes away the glass he was about
to use, simply because his table-fellow had
drunk from it. This does not imply that the
glass waa otherwl.-e unclean than by having
had a neighbor's lips touch the rim. Shall we
be less fastidious at the Lord"*!, table than at
our own? From the standpoint of the hum
blest home in this land, to say nothing of the
standpoint of sanitary science, the cup which
is severally drank from without turning, r S
extrojne ritualists use it, Is an unclean cup
until it has been cleansed with something be
sides human lips.
Mr. Bolton admits that he uses his own
mouth to wipe the edge of the cup after those
at the rail have communicated. He tries to
explain away its luck of tidiness by saying
this cleaning of the cup with his own lips takes
place after those at the rail have communi
cated. He noKlects to state that the cup which
has been thus cleaned is not washed, but is
used again for the people to drink from, so his
mouth 1s the cleansing agency, and people do
drink after he- has wiped the cup with his lips
without the cup being washed between cele
brations. I should be glad to learn that I nm
mistaken in Mr. Bolton's particular use of his
chalice. But I am not mistaken about this
being the general practice of the "confrater
nity" ritualists.
Mr. Bolton says the "confraternity" is not a
secret society and that Its doings are open to
the light of day. That being true let me ask
two questions. Firstâ Does Mr. Bolton turn
the cup as he is passing it from one to the
other at the communion rail, or do all drink
from the same place on the rim of the Cup?
Secondâ Has it been his practice to wash with
water the outside and the iuslde of trie rim of
that cup after he has cleaned it with his lips
before it. is used again for the communicants
at the rail? Every physician and nearly all
laymen know that there are at least three
deadly and incurable diseases which may be
trausniitted by an indiscriminate use of the
same drinking cup without washing. So this
is right to the point and it is not personal.
Will Mr. Bolton please enlighten us in regard
to these points without reservation or eva
sion?
Yes, I know people talk about Lotta's foun
tain and ferry water barrels, but I never saw
any one drink at those Dlace* who did not pre
viously wash and rinse and run water in and
out of the cud until it was clean. The veriest
tramp does this, but no one has a chance to
rinse a cup as it is passing at the communion
rail. No, it won't do to say this is a matter that
rests with the clergy, for the people are the
ones who do the drinking and they have a
right to demand that they have a clean cup.
We must not be so godly that we cannot be
cleanly, lor "cleanliness is next to godliness."
We must get our health standards irom the
medical profession, not the clerical. The
clergy may properly sow "spiritual" things,
but it is from the laity they expect "worldly"
things, the financial thiugs, the sanitary
things about which the clergyman nas not the
proper means of judging.
The battles ot the Reformation were fought
thai the ci'.urch might be freed from priestly
abuses nnd Jtonush errors a:nl practices, and I
am simply doing that which I agreed to do at
my ordination when I strive to 'drive away
from the church all erroneous and strange
doctrine contrary to God's word, and to use
both public and private monitions as need
shall require and occasion shall ue given."
With that obligation full upon me (and I <io
not recoil from it) I would invite Mr. Bolton
to look at his own preface egnin and then
reconcile his teachings with those of the
house of bishops of the Episcopal Church in
America and the prayer-book. Would one sus
pect from the following preface that Mr. Bolton
teaches that after he has consecrated the
bread and wine at the Lord's supper it actu
ally becomes trie real body and Dlood ot Jesus
Christ, witli blood, bone, nerves and flesh, and
whatsoever else pertains to a real material
human body? That is what the 'confraternity'
is for â to promulgate just that thing and the
ritual growing out of it. It is what is called
transutistHutiiition and is the Romish part of
the society's teaching in particular.
Thn way Mr. Holton makes it read in his
little preface is as follows, and please notice
how innocent it seems: 1. The honor due to
the person of our Lord Jesus Christ is the
blessed sacrameut of his body and blood.
They think the}' have the real body (and
blood) before them, and they bow to it and
genuflect and must eat ai;d dri ik it all, be
cause it is his own gi-nuino body and blood.
That is why Mr. Bolton wipes the edge of the
cup with his lips. Was I far from the plain
truth of the matter when 1 said such practices
had their root in an idolatry forbidden by the
commandments and a horrid cannibalism
which was opposed to every civilized instinct?
Now see what the prayer-book teaches about
it, page 564, article 28:
Transubstantiation (or the change of the sub
stance of bread and wine) in the supper of the
Lord cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but Is repug
nant to the plain words of scripture, overthroweth
the nature of a sacrament, and hath given occa
sion to many superstitions. The Dody of Christ Is
given, t&r.eri and eaten In the supper only after a
hea*euly aud spiritual manner.
Upnn this authority, of his own church,
which Mr. Boltou is not loyal to, I protest in
the name of Episcopalians all over this coast.
This Romish teaching gives rise to great in
jury to the church, as well as to practices of
uncleanlii'.ess in the use of the communion
cup. .My contention is for the clean cup,
which will properly honor the Lord, from
which we drink the wine "in remembrance
that Christ's blood was shed for us." It Mr.
Bolton thinks he can be an honorable church-
man while teaching that which his church
forbids aiter he has promised to uphold her
ancient practices as "set forth by this church,"
tlint is a matter for him to settle with his
Bishop. I have no intention of constituting
myself his official accuser, for it would doubt
less please him too well to pose as a martyr to
his favorite views. In the third division of
his preface Mr. Bolton says the society Is to
"promote the observance of the Catholic and
primitive practice of receiving the holy com
muniou â fatting. What business has a loyal
and an honorable church clergyman to give
time and energy to such a teaching as this
when our house of bishops, as late as 18!J5,
sent to all the clergy of the United States tlieir
views of this practice in a "pastoral letter?"
Hear whnt they say aDout fasting before
receiving the holy communion: "It has no
warrant in the words or iv the circumstances
of the institution of the sacrament. And
there is no statement in the prayer boot hs to
the requirements for the right reception of
the holy communion which includps it or im
plies it. And therefore no minister of this
church is justified in doing more than to com
mend it where it may be safely used to such
as can receive it." Page 16.
If Mr. Bolton Is a better authority on what
the Episcopal Church believes and teaches
than her house of bishops and the ritual con
tained in her book of common prayer that fact
has not yet appeared to the church at large.
My pliin feeling in regard to him is, that as
his ritualistic services are at complete va
rinnce with the teachings and belief of the
American church, he ought, as an honorable
Christian gentleman, either to teach and do
what the Episcopal Church teaches and does
or cease eating her bread Frankly, I know
no way to distinguish Sir. Bolton's teaching
and practices from those of Rome, except that
having a wife he cannot be in the Roman
Calho-lic priesthood. Xor In saying this do I
intend to have it construed into a personality,
for it is not. It is the plain, everyday, com
mon truth, and two-thirds of the Episcopal
clergymen and communicants on this coast
know it to be an unprejudiced opinion.

Ex-Offlcer Banks' Whereabouts.
OAKLAND, Oal., Jan. 26.â Several
montns ago Officer Banks mysteriously
disappeared from this city and his where
abouts remained a mystery until last
nigbt.
Officer Carson arrested a tramp by the
name df Tom Kelly, and on the way to
the police station Kelly told the officer
that lie was sleeping in a lumber-pile at
Chicago, and when he awoke be saw
Banks handling lumber.
He sooke to Banks, but the latter tried
to deny his identity. Later on he ack
nowledged that he was the ex-police offi
cer of this city.
Banks is wanted here for bribery and
perjury. 4 An effort will probably be made
to have Banks arrested and returned to
this city.

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27.â Last night
little Willie Byers, 6 years of age, spent
the night in jail because there was no in

is but one more instance of the necessity
of providing a home, such as was outlined
in an article which appeared in The Call

PASSING OF THE ADOBE.
La Casa Molino del Rey, the
Oldest Landmark, Razed to
the Ground
Anniversary Dinner of the Brother
hood of Andrew and Philip.
Midnight Raid.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 27.â One of the
oldest landmarks of this city was razed to
the ground to-day. It was familiarly
known as "La Casa Molino del Rey," and
has been the scene of many masquerades
and other social diversions which marked
the early life of Alameaans. In those
days the house was surrounded by a dense
growth of oak trees and heavy under
brush. Many a one has lost himself in
the wild and dark tangle at night. A
cheery light in the old abode was always
a welcome beacon to the wayfarer and he
always found a good Samaritan in the
Tappan family.
La Casa stood on what Is now Fifth
street, and was the home of the genial and
big-hearted Robert B. Tappan. There he
was born ana for thirty-eight years en
joyed life as he never will again. In 1856
James Millington, for many years a City
Clerk of this city, built a kitchen, making
five rooms in all. Not a scantling entered
into its makenp. The house was fast fall
ing into decay and served no other pur
pose save to attract the curious as a re
minder of the days when, as- Judge Tap
pan states, Alameda was not upon the
maps, but a cattle- range of Peralta's
princely grant.
Anniversary Dinner.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 27.â The Brother
hood of Andrew and Philip of the First
Congregational Church of this city gave
their annual dinner last evening with
about 125 guests present. "Blessed Be
the Tie That Binds" was sung and the
Rev. J. A. Cruzan offered an opening
prayer. This was followed by an address
of welcome by President W. W. Ander
son, after which Mr. Graves, who with Mr.
Drake represented the Society of St. An
drew of Christ Church; Rev. Dr. Bovard,
on behalf of the Park-street M. E. Church;
Dr. W. C. Pond of the Bethany Congre
gational Church of San Francisco; Mr.
Start, representing the Presbyterian
church, and others spoke.
At 6:30 o'clock the guests were seated at
a table in tne shape of a hollow square.
After satisfying the inner man the .-Ã¼b
ject of the evening, "A Christian Man
hood," was discussed admirably by the
Rev. George B. Hatch of Berkeley, Pro
fessor Elmer E. Brown of the University
of California, 11. P. Hardy of San Rafael,
J. R. Knodell of Oakland, Thomas AdJi
son, M. D. of Berkeley and the Rev. J. A.
Cruzan. The order is an organization of
men for mutual help in the Christian life
and for the spread of Christ's k kingdom
among men. Its two rules are:
Firstâ To pray daily lor the spread of
Christ's Kingdom among men.
Second â To make an earnest effort each
week to bring at least one man within
hearing of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as
set forth in the services of the church and
its organizations.
A Midnight Bald.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 27.â Ah Sou and
Chong Sou of Clement avenue were awak
ened just before 1 o'clock this morning by
the barking of their dog. Upon EOintr to
the door they saw four men leaaing off
tneir four horses. They made a dash for
their animals and three that were going
westward dropped the halters and ran
away. The otner one was bound for the
east and escaped with his horse. Half an
hour later Quong Hing Kee of Bianding
avenue heard his wagon start off. As he
had left it unhitched he decided it was
stolen, and reported the case to the police.
No tracks of either have been found to
day, and it is not Known whether the
horsethief was the one who tooK the
wagon or not.
NEW FOOTBALL CAPTAIN.
Berkeley Will Name Its Leader
for '97 Upon Next
Saturday.
It Is Probable Ttat Carr '99 or Has
kell '97 Will Withdraw in
Favor of the Others-
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 27.â The man
who will lead Berkeley's football team to
victory or defeat in the coming Thanks
giving intercollegiate match will be chosen
next Saturday afternoon. The player on
whose shoulders will rest the responsibil
ity of next season's training, and in a
large measure on whose energy, coolness
and generalship will depend the destiny
of the Berkeley team, will be singled out
from the thirteen players who did battle
for the cause of the blue and gold last
Thanksgiving day. The choosing of a
football captain is popularly considered in
college circles as the most important elec
tion of the year.
Out of the five candidates prominently
mentioned at the opening of the term the
list has narrowed down to two. These
are Carr and Haskell. Both did good
work in the intercollegiate, both are hard
and hendy players, and both seem to pos
sess the necessary executive qualifications.
Matters may be adjusted so as to have
one of the two candidates withdraw, as
was the case last year when Sherman and
Ransome were up, and make tue elccion
unanimous.
Basket-UaH Players.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 27.â The co-eds
of Stanford University are anxious for an
other ba*ket-ball contest with Berkeley,
but the girls of the State University are
not disposed to enter another intercol
legiate match, so it is not likely that a
game can be arranged.

MOTT RESIGNS.
Will Not Try to Succeed Himself as
Councilman.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27â Frauk Mott,
President ot the City Council, who was
nominated by the Republicans last week
to succeed himself, surprised politicians
to-day by sending the following letter of
withdrawal to the City Central Committee:
To the Chairman and Members of the Republican
City CeiUral Committeeâ Oesilrmes : Although
strenously protesting against the use of my
name as a candidate for Councilman from the
First Ward of this city I fina ly yielded to tne
importunities and persuasion of my friends
and permitted myself to be a candidate for re
nomlnation, hoping that I might arrange to
accept the nomination, and in the event of
election render some further public service to
the city.
However, after very careful corsideration
of all the interests affected by my action, I
find that my own business interests and the
interests of those who are connected with me,
require so much of my time and strength as
to lenve none for other matters. I, therefore,
respectfully resign, and decline the nomina
tion of Councilman from tne First Ward ten
dered to me by the Republican Convention of
this city.
Assuring you of my interest in the wellare
of the ticket named by our common party, and
of my hope for its success, I am very respect
fully yours, FRANK K. MOTT.
In this connection an oversight has been
discovered regarding the delegation of
power by the convention to the central
committee. It has always been custom
ary for the convention to authorize the
committee to fill all vacancies, but on this
occasion this was not done and there may
be some complications arise in the ap
pointment of a candidate to take Mr.
Mott's place. The Municipal League will
hold an executive meeting next Monday
evening in Masonic Hall, when a full
ticket will be nominated from the choice
of the three parties.
There is talk of a Citizens' ticket being
placed in the field, but it appears to be
simply the talk of a few politicians, none
of whom can be found who will admit tney
are connected with it.
The Republican City Central Commit
tee met to-night and decided to take Mr.
Mott's resignation under advisement.
A Difference of Opinion.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27.â The Mer
chants' Exchange is in receipt of a letter
from Assemblyman Waymirein which he
says he does not approve of the bill mak
ineit legal to attach salaries of public
officials. He says the remedy of creditors
is to refuse credit to those who will not
pay.
The exchange has passed the lollowing
resolution:
Eesolved, That the communication from
Judge Waymire be received and placed on
file: and be it further
Resolved, That the Merchants' Exchange
does uot believe the reason given by Judge
Wayinire to be founded on equity and justice;
and be it further
Resolved, Tnat the Merchants' Exchange be
lieves it to be the duty of the legislative body
to so make the laws of the Btate that they
will protect mercantile interests from the acts
of dishonest officials as well as from private
citizens.

SHARKEY KNOCKED
OUT IN ONE ROUND
Justice Carroll Did the
Act and Softly
Smiled.
The Issue Was the Payment of
George Alien's Ciaim for
Services.
This Was Decided in Favor of Alien
for the Full Amount Claimed
for Training.
Tom Sharkey, the pugilist, has been
knocked out. The act was performed by
a small man, who had no gloves on at the
time. This small man is compact and
trim and wiry. The remarkable thing
about the whole affair really is that when
Sharkey was knocked out the small man
was sitting and had a pen in his stoat
right fist. Several spectators were there.
The small man was Justice of the Peace
John A. Carroll. Before him for consid
eration was the case of Raver against
Thomas J. Sharkey. The way Raver
came to be the plaintiff was that George
Allen, who prepared Sharkey for his fistic
encounter with "Lanky Bob" Fitzsim
mons, and who claimed that he had never
been fully paid for his serviced, assigned
his claim to Raver. Thereby the knotty
question came before Justice Carroll as to
whether assisting a pugilist to engage in a
fistic encounter was participation in an
unlawful act. Of course if the act was un
lawful there would be no recovery at law.
Sharkey's counsel propelled this ques
tion at Raver, who, as assignee, sat imper
turbably by, and it came with the force of
a catapultic blow from Bob's "good right."
But it did not land.
Yesterday Justice Carroll gathered him
self in a struggle with the legal question,
for there was no question concerning the
performance of the alleged service. Then
he wrote the following decision, which set
tled Sharkey in one round :
This is an action brought by plaintiff to recover
the sum 01 $299 99, alleged to bo due for work
and labor penornied and services rendered
by one Georee Allen, the assignor of the plain
tiff, in and about the training of the de
fendant for a certain glove contest with one
Robert Fitzsimmons.
It is urged with much emphasis, by the at
torney for the defendant, that no recovery
can be had in this action, inasmuch as the
services which were performed by the de
fendant were unlawfnl, for the reason that
said services were render-.'d the defendant for
a "flsiic encounter,"' and that such contests
are prohibited by statute.
I have no doubt that this rule would apply
if the assignor were a principal to the so-called
"fistic encounter," as is claimed by the de
fendant, but in the case at bar the'assignor
was simply a servant to perform certain du
ties for defendant. If this so-called "fistic en
counter" had never taken place, could the ques
tion of a violation of the statute then be
raised?
It has been decided by our Supreme Court
that horse-racing is contrary to public morals,
but there are numerous decisions which hold
that the trainer of a racehorse and the jockey
who rode him were entitled to recover for
their services, and I am of opinion that the
same rule applies to this action, and that the
plaintiff herein is entitled to recover.
The only question then to be determined is
the amount of damages to which the plaintiff
Is ent.tled. The defendant does not deny that
A'len worked for him for the time specified,
but he claims that he paid Allen the sum of
$200, and this amount he claims was sufficient
for his services.
Danny Xeedham, Jimmy Carroll, Billy
Smith, and swme other pugilists of less note,
testified to the value of services rendered by
Allen, and there seems to be a consensus of
opinion that the sum of $500 would be a very
reasonable nrnount for the services rendered;
and as no evidence has been offered to con
tradict this testimony, I must be governed by
it. It is therefore ordered that judgment be
entered in favor of the plain tin" as prayed.
When the body blow had been admin
iptpred Justice Carroll leaned back and
smiled conter.tÂ°d!y.
BUT NINETY-NINE LEFT.
The Exempt Fire Company Holds
Its Annual Election ot
0 ficers.
The Last Su: viving Reiic of San Fran
cisco's Volunteer Fire Depart
ment at a B?i quet.
The annual election of officers of the
Exempt Fire Company, the last surviving
reiic of the San Fr ncisco Volunteer
Fire Department, resulted in the choice of
the following named to serve for the cur
rent year: President, George T. Bohen;
vice-president, Andrew J. Jessnp; secre
tary, J.- J. Guilfoyle; treasurer, James W.
Kentzel; directors â Joseph Figei, George
J. Hobe, William Larkina, W. L. Rickman
ana Joseph Marshall.
Monday evening tne Exempts gave a ban
quet in the "Old House on the Hill," and
there were present besides the members a
number of invited guests, most-prominent
among them Mayor J. D. Phelan.
After an excellent menu had been dis
cussed, Colonel C. L. Taylor spoke of the
heroic worfc of the brave firemen and de
clared that they are deserving of the most
liberal appropriation to enable them to
carry out their most hazardous duties, and
declared that the $12,000 paid annually to
assist those old-time volunteers who by
reason of age and disability are no longer
able to provide for themselves is money
. well spent.
James O'Donnell. secretary of the com
mittee that has the distribution of the
money, read statistics, showing that at
the time the Volunteer Department was
disbanded there were 826 members who
joined the Exempts and 465 who did not.
Since then 296 firemen hay-) been buried
by the Exempts, and by reason of the loss
throueh resignations and for non-payment
of dues there are on the roll but 99 of the
B_6. He also stated thai aside from the 99
but 325 old firemen are living, and that
since the organization of the department
in 1850 there have died 966 Exempts. He
then gave an account of the disbursements
of the money in sums from $10 to $20 for
disabled firemen, many of them taken
from the Almsbouse and hospitals.
Mayor Phelan, after alluding briefly to
the organization and the work that the
pallant firemen had done, said: "You
have strong claims on the City govern
ment, ana when you make a call for aid
that call should be answered with the
same alacrity that you showed when you
were called to duty."
The speaker then told how ne learned
to appreciate the valiant deeds of firemen
when be witnessed the great fire at the
World's Fair at Chicago, when so many
firemen lost their lives in the discharge of
duty, and concluded Dy saying, after pay
ing a plorious tribute to the Exempts: "If
in your old age you firemen ask for com
pensation to aid* you in declining years,
not by favor, but by liglit, you are entitled
to it; you have earned your reward."
Auditor Broderick said that no bill was
more justified than the one giving an
allowance to support the old veterans.
Ex-Judge Robert Ferral made an elo
quent address aud there were speeches by
"Uncle" George Bromley, Lew Battler,
Supervisor Britt and others, and then fol
lowed songs that ttie old boys used to
sing and stories of volunteer days.
The committee on invitations, consisting
I of George T. Bohen, A. J. Jessup, J. J.
I Guilfoyle and J. W. K>ntzel, sent invita
tions to Governor Budd, Lieutenant-
Governor Jeter, Mayor Phelan, the twelve

THE GLEANERS' REUNIONS.
The Object of a New Society to Fur
nish Entertainment for the Ex-
F-mpts Facing: the End.
The flag-raising commemorating the
fiftieth anniversary of the taking posses
sion of California by Commodore Sloac,
which took place on Portsmouth square
last July under thÂ« auspices of the Ex
empt Fire Company of the Ban Francisco
Volunteer Fire Department, and the inter
esting friendly reunion which followed
the event, were what inspired the forma
tion of a society composed of women re
lated to lhe brave, unselfish firemen who,
in the earlvdays, sacrificed, money, health
and life to protect the interests of the San
Francisco pioneers.
This organization, of which Mrs. Geoige
J. riobe, the wife of one of the old-time
firemen, is president and Mrs. Andrew J.
Jessup is vice-president, has been in ex
istence a few months. "The ladies, " said
Mrs. President Hobe, "first obtained from
the ExemDts permission to hold reunions
in the meeting hall of the company.
Then they held a preliminary meetine on
the 22d of August and on the 16th of Sep
tember following the organization was
completed by the selection of tiie present
president and vice-Dresident and the selec
tion of Mrs. A. McCrcsen, Mrs. McFar
land and Mrs. Ameiia Freeman as an ex
ecutive committee. The society was
cnristened 'The Gleaners,' for all at the
meeting realized that they were entering
a field on which the reapers had finished
their work. The memories of 'Auld Liang
Syne' inspired them all, even at this late
day, to gather something that would glad
den the hearts of the fire laddies who are
facing the sunset of life.
"Trie Gleaners are banded together to
work for the Exempts and promote so
cial and intellectual intercourse among
the families of the members of the old
Volunteer Department. For years and
years the men met and were well ac
quainted with one another, but there had
not been in ail these many years meet
ings of the female relatives of these old
firemen.
"Joseph Figel, who was present at one
of the reunions, voiced the sentiments of
all when he expressed the hope that the
lady relatives of the Exempts would per
petuate the memory of the gallant tire
men â a body of men ranking second to
none in The annals of thÂ« City.
"Our object," continued Mrs. Hobe, "is
to promote a spirit of sociability amon?
the families of the Exempts. Our
reunions are informal, non-sectar.an and
non-political. We have no salaries to pay
and no officer will be allowed to receive a
present. Women of good character, re
lated to Volunteer fireman who at the
time of the disbandment of tho Volunteer
Department were entitled to exemption
certificates, are eligible to membership.
We hold our reunions on the third Wednes
day of eaca month in the hall of the Ex
empts. The president and vice-president
are elected annually and the executive
committee is appointed by the president
and a committee on entertainment is ap
pointed each month The only revenue is
the contribution to the mitebox by mem
bers and visitors, as there are no dues.
"We have already had two very pleas
ant reunions, the last on the third Mon
day ol the current month. Vice-President
Mrs. Jesaup had charge of the programme.
There was a piano solo by Miss Galvin;
the president gavn those present a little
talk about the society, its aims and gov
erning principles, und gave some remin
iscences; Joseph Figel on behalf of the
Exempts delivered an interesting speech,
which was full of instructive information ;
Charles Plum, ex-president of the Ex
empts, delivered a pleasing address; Mr.
Junes and Mr. and Mrs. J. Ken'.zel gays ex
celient vocal music, and Professor Harris
gave some artistic music on the piano,
mandolin ana banjo."
Considerable interest has beefe awakened
by the Gleaners, and names are being
constantly added to the roll of member
ship. It will no doubt soon outnumber
the Exempts, who now have but ninety
nine on the roll.
Bogus Fire Detective.
A man calling himself a private fire detec
tive has been visiting a number of residences
in Hayes Valley for the ostensible purpose of
examining the stovepipes anj chimneys. The

MORE DISCOURSE
ON BAD PRINTING
Old Straw Thrashed Over
Again in the Cooney
Case.
The Enright Deeds Refused as
Evidence Against the
Notary.
More Expert Testimony on the Matter
of Technical Work in a Press-
Room and Such Like.
Because a man has turkey in his hon?e
it is no proof that he did not feed on beef
steak for dinner.
This was the gustatory metaphor Attor
ney Patrick,"VV. Reddy introduced into the
Cooney case yesterday to shut off the in
troduction of a certain deed as evidence
which the notary acknowledged on the
same date as li is notarial certificate to the
famous pencil deeds. The day in ques
tion is September 21, 1894, and on that day
Cooney put his certificate to a deed made
by Joseph E. Enrijjht, conveying certain
property to his rnfe. In this case he used
a form with bis name printed on it. In
the .case of Mrs. Craven's deeds the ac
knowledgment was made on a general
blank. The Fair people see in the~e facts
evidence against Cooney. Through Assist
ant Prosecuting Attorney Hosiner they
endeavored to ret the Enright document
into court, and then it was Reddy sprung
the turkey metaphor to his o-vn advan
tage.
When Magistrate Carroll Cook heard
arguments on both sides. Hosnier con
tended that the fact that Cooney used his
individual blanks on one deed and gene
ral DlanKs on Craven deeds, was proof,
prima facie, that there was something
â wrong. Keddy stood pat on the turkey
logic, and in the end the court fell in;o
line.
The prosecution put Detective Seymour
on the stand to formally introduce the
Enright documents, after a tedious day
of technical evidence on the part of a
number of H. S. Crocker <fe Co.'s em
ployes. For many a day the Fair chil
dren have held these deeds up their sleeve
to spring at an opportune moment in
tfapir tigbt against Mrs. Craven.
The pencil deeds were acknowledged by
Cooney at his place of business, 11 Mont
gomery street. The Wright documents
were exectfted in his father's office in the
Pbelaii building. That is wny, according
to the young notary, different forms of
notarial certificates were used. But tbis
explanation has never been satisfactory to
the Fair people. They see in this use of
different blanks a world of meaning. It
was not probable, they argued, that
Cooney would use a general form in one
case and a blank containing his printed
name in another without cause. The
reason they advanced was that the pencil
deeds acknowledgments were made after
Fair's dtath and on forms that would
bring home no telltale evidence of such a
fraud. Tbese Wrigbt deeds have been in
the pos^es-.ion of the attorneys for the
Fair children since the inception of tbe
case. Yesterday was the first time they
undertook to make them a factor in ihe
case. Notwithstanding their defeat it is
very probable that to-day they will at
tempt to get tbe documents into court by
a round-about method, and have turkey
take the precedence for the nonce of beet
steak.
Aside from this incident the proceedings
in the cass yesterdny wore devoid o! in
terest. Attorney Reddy was thrashing
old straw in the hope of cornering any
stray grain. In the morning George W.
yon Abn was put on the stand to tell how
a job in printing is locked in the "chase"
in Crocker & Co.'s establishment. He re
membered mat in 1894 a stereotype of the
ordinary notarial hlanu was made. It was
destroyed in I^s because it was neces
sary to insert the words "to me" in the
Â£opy. There was some technical testi
mony ou type and the manner in which it
is distributed, when Attorney Reddy
asKed:
"What became of the stereotype?"
"1 destroyed it as soon as the order
came up to insert the words 'to me' in the
form."
"Did you ever mako any other changes
in the reading? '
"Not that I remember."
"Was the same type used In all forms?"
â¢'I suppose it was."
"You u&ed electrotypes ol the words
'State oi California' in printing all legal
blanks?"

"I suppose we did generally. The elec
trotypes were in use when I entered the
employ of Crocker & Co. Sometimes I
have set np the form entirely from type."
Fred J. Daniels was called to shed more
light on the matter of ''locking forms."
He identified various marks he had made
on the proofs and copy he had of notarial
blanks printed since 1894.
Charles H. Crocker said the words "to
me" had been dropped about 1891 and
printed again in 1895.
W. A. Stanlord was again called to
identify some marks he made on the copy
for 10,000 notarial blanks on January 8,
1896. Vor. Ann came back again to say he
knew nothing of proofs or forms printed
prior to 1894, because it was the custom to
destroy this kind of stuff after it was three
years old.
J. O. Jephson, a printer at 1709 Market
street, took the stand to say he had printed
the forms used by Cooney on the Enright
deeds, but was not allowed to tell his
story, because Attorney R.eddy said this
fact'had nothing to do with the perjury
charge against Cooney. The case will be
resumed this morning.
OOEINTHIAN YAOHT CLUB.
New Officers Klected and a Long De-
bate Over What Is an Amateur,
The Corinthian Yacht Club hÂ«sld its an
nual meeting last night in Rd Mon's
Hall, 510 Bush street, elected officers for
tl:p eusaing year, fruitlessly debated the
detiniiion of an amateur athlete, and con
cluded with a little social time furnished
in a neighboring refreshment place by the
newly elected officers, who are" as follows:
Commodore, Alex J. Young; vice-com
modore, Carl WestTfeld; port captain,
John H. Keefe; board of directors â Alex
J. Young, Carl Westerfeld, John EL
Kee:e, E. B. Lathrop, 0. L. Barrett, F. R.
Cook, William Fisher; regatta com
mitteeâJ. H. Happs, P. J. Morbenstein,
T. J. Kavanaugh.
Some of the Principal Figures That Appeared in the Cooney Case
Yesterday.
The treasurer's report showed that the
club has beeun the new year with a neat
balance of $330 93. During the year past
the total receipts were $1926 and the total
disbursements $L7*is 07.
There are now 144 members in the
Corinthian Yacht Club.
The appointment of inter-club delegates
was left to the board of directors.
John W.- Pew. the retiring president,
was chairman of the meeting, and there
were forty-five members present.
The proposed definition of an amateur
yacbtsnian, whicb was much discussed
and without definite action, reads: "An
amateur or Corinthian yachtsman is one
who has never accepted remuneration for
services rendered in handling or serving
on a yacht or any coastwise or inland
water craft, or wbo is a professional in
any other sport." Many of the members
thought this too exclusive.
THAT OONTBACT MAEEIAGE.
Quackenbush Against (juackenbuah
otill Occupies Judge Seawell.
The troubles of Thomas M. Quackenbush
and his wife, Nancy Abbott-Quackenbush,
again occupied Judge Seawell's attention
yesterday.
Mrs. Quackenbush claims a right to $500
a month for permanent support by virtue
of a marriaee by contract.
Quackenbush admits that the writing is
his, but says he did not know what he was
signing.
The first witness called was Mrs. Delia
Heermans, who testified: "The first time
1 met Mr. Quackenbush was at Mrs.
Quackenbush's home on Leavenworth
street. I met him on a Sunday at dinner
with a Judge Hardy. I met him fre
quently on Sundays at dinner, and in ihe
evening he would remain and I would con
verse witn him and with her. It was at one
of those times that he told me of bis engage
ment. He told me be wan engaged to Mrs.
Abbott, and that they were to be married
and take a trip to Canada and also to New
York, and that he was going to build a
house for her, and that the house would
be built just as slie planned it."
Mrs. Mary Gooding, Mrs. Harret
Macool, F. C. Noble and Henry W.
Brindelson had known Mr. Quackenbush
and Mrs. Abbott and bad supposed them
to be married. Their knowledge on this
point was not clear. Further testimony
in this case is to be heard to-day.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1897.
MOURNING IN THE
BIG BROWN HOUSE
Mrs. Flood, Stricken With
Pneumonia, Died Last
Evening.
Conscious to the Last She Talked
and Prayed With Those
Around Her.
Her Children Were With Her When
the End Came â Funeral to Be
Unostentatious.
There is mourning in the big brown
stone mansion on California street. Mrs.
Mary L. Flood, widow of the late million
aire, James C. Flood, died last night at
9:30 o'clock.
Last Sunday evening she was taken ill
and her ailment rapidly developed into
pneumonia. Dr. Morse was summoned
and everything possible to check tue dis
ease was done, but it was useless.
Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Flood began to
fail, and it was evident that death was
near at hand.
Yesterday she failed to show signs of
improvement, but remained conscious
and cheerful. Around her bedside were
gathered her children. Her mind re
mained unclouded to the lost, and up to
within a few moments before her death
she talked and prayed with those around
her.
Mrs. Flood came to this City la?t fall to
take up her permanent residence in the big
brownstone mansion on the brow of Nob
Hill.
She had been living in the almost
since the death of her husband, but bad
determined to make her San Francisco
house her home.
While in the East her health was not of
the best, and one of the reasons for her
taking her residence here was the hope
thatt he California climate would benefit
her.
With her came her daughter, and while
neither Mrs. Flood nor her daughter were
often seen in society circles their in
fluence was great. They never seemed to
care for social life and the mansion on the
hill has never been lit up for an evening's
pleasure.
In charitable circles Mrs. Flood was
well known, although her charity was not
of the ostentatious kind. She gave largely,
but she gave quietly, and many who par
took of her boumy knew not from whose
hand it came. It is certain, however, that
her charities amounted to several thou
sands every year.
When she was taken ill last Sunday it
was not supposed that the malady would
become serious, but as her strength began
to fail, her family became much alarmed,
and never left her bedside except for a
moment at a time.
Monday the nrst symptoms of pneu
monia showed themselves and then it was
the suspicion that the illness might prove
fatal came into the minds of those around
her.
Tuesday she was better, but the im
provement was but for a few hours and
she showed 3igns that the disease was
growing upon her.
YeÃterday morning about 2 o'clock she
sank so low that her children thought the
end was near, but again she rallied and
passed the day in safely.
As evening approached it became ap
parent, however, that there was no hope,
and friends and relatives could only stand
by the bed and wait for the end. It came
at half-past 9.
Mrs. Flood was 69 years old. She leaves
two children, Cora Jane Flood and James
L. Flood, both of whom live in the house
on the hill.
As yet no arrangements fur the funeral
have been made, but it is understood that
tha interment will be private.
Mrs. Flood's estate, from all accounts,
amounts to a very large figure. Since
James C. Flood died his estate has been
divided in various ways and much more
of it has gone to the children than was
given to them at bis death.

PIEE, WATEE AND WHEELS.
Their Devotees to Be Enlisted in the
Carnival Scheme.
F. W. Billings, secretary of the Watson
ville Volunteer Fire Department, has ad
dressed a letter to the carnival directors
regarding a proposition to have a volun
teer firemen's tournament some day dur
ing carnival week. No provision has been
made by the executive committee for any
tiremen's tournament, but if a sufficient
number of the Volunteer Firemen's Asso
ciation of the State should signify their
willingness to participate in such an af
fair the committee would devote an after
noon to it.
A letter was this morning addressed to
the secretary of the Pacitic Inter- Yacht
Club Association calling the attention of
that body to the fact that a day had been
set apart for a naval display, in which it
was proposed to assemble all the war ves
sels, yachts, etc., in the bay in a grand
marine pageant, to be concluded with a
regatta of sailing vessels. The associa
tion has been asked to name a committee
to confer with the carnival directors on
the detail?.
The Cycle Board of Trade and Asso
ciated Wheelmen will noli a meeting to
morrow night in the assembly-room of the
California Hotel, to discuss bicycle day
in carnival week.
DEFICITS IN CITY FUNDS
Dr. Rottanzi's Caustic Comments
en Seme Lavish Expen-
ditures.
With Strict Economr Many Deficits
May Vanish at the End of
the Fiscal Ye2r.
Dr. Rottanzi, the chairman of the Fi
nance Committee of the Board of Super
visors, has been busily engaged for some
time in clearing up the City's balance
sheet. Upon consultation with the chair
men of the various Supervisorial commit
tees and their assistants he hopes that an
economical administration henceforth will
leave ultimately no deficit.
As affairs stand now, including con
tracts for $12,500 in the Street Depart
ment, there is a net deficit of $71,898 44.
The greatest apparent deficit, impos
sible for the Finance Committee to curtail
on account of vicious laws enacted by
previous Legislatures, exists in the County
Clerk's office. The deficit in that particu
lar department for the first six months
amounts to $13,646 83.
As its oxpenses last year were over
$134,000 and the appropriation for this
year is only $100,000. the approximate de
ficit will foot up over $34,000.
In the street-hunting fund there is a
deficit of $11,322 50 for the first six months.
On consulting with Mr. Rivers, Dr.
Rottanzi believes this appropriation will
be made to balance before the end of the
year.
In the Street Department the deficit
amounts to $19,310. Outstanding con
tracts on hand aggregate $12,500, thus
leavine the department to run on about
one-thira the appropriation for the next
six months. Chairman Devany believes
that with strict economy f here will be no
deficit at the end of the fiscal year.
The stationery and supplies department
has a deficit of $2405 16 out of an appro
priation of $22,000. Chairman Hawkins
slated to Dr. Roitanzi that all the depart
ments were without any stationery what
ever, and that "the cleanup was com
plete." By curtailing expenses he expects
to come out clear at the end of the fiscal
year.
"I 'hink the City and County Hospital, "
said Dr. Rottanzi, "has been conducted in
the most scandalous manner. As a mem
ber of the Hospital Committee, on visit
ing that institution I was not surpmed,
but simply horrified at the condition in
which thai institution had been left.
"Tne amount appropriated for repairs
was shamefully wasted and the place left
in a most deplorable and unsanitary con
dition. The deficit for the first six months
amounts to $3787 81, and the repair fund
was overdrawn by $789 23.
"I did not care to interfere with the ex
pert of the Board of Health in bis work,
but am willing to co-operate with that
b dy in bringing to light the criminal ex
penditures made in that institution.
"In County Jail No. 2 the deficit aggre
gated $2725 28 and in the police patrol
$1800 2L
"The election fund was overdrawn by
$12,600 81. No remedy can be had for
this unless there be a surplus in other
departments.
"There are surpluses in several depart
ments. That in the fire alarm repair fund
amounts to $7717 20."
Dr. Rottan/i believes that in great part
the deficit is due to extravagance in tne
management of affairs and the crea
tion at Sacramento of unnecessary offices
with large Kalaries in this City.
JENNIE PARSONS' MONEY.
Her Relatives l-lghtlng Her Husband*
Kin for th# Uatate.
The contest in the estate of Jennie Par
son*, deceased, has been narrowed down
between the relatives of Mrs. Parsons on
one side and the relatives of Otis Parsons
on the other side.
Mrs. Parsons and her husband were both
drowned at sea ninety miles from Victoria
by the wreck of the steamship Pacific in
1875.
A year ago a woman calling herself Mrs.
Minnie Adams Brooks laid claim to the
estate of $4000 on the ground that she was
the daughter oi Mrs. Parsons and at the
same time offering a will said to have been
written by Mrs. Parsons after the ship
began to go down. It was represented
that the will was nicked up in a bottle on
the coast near the wreck.
Some time ago the so-called Dottle will
was declared invalid and at yesterday's
hearing of the case it was learned that
Mro. Brooks is dead. No appearance was
made on behalf of her heirs.
A continuance of a month was granted
for the purpose of taking the deposition
of Neil Henley, the only survivor of the
wreck, for the purpose of proving which
was first drowned Mr. or Mrs. Parsons, as
on that point depends the inheritance of
the estate.
THE STOEM IS GENERAL
Heavy Rains Falling in All Parts of
the State.
According to the reports received at the
local weather bureau the rain that
reached this City yesterday morning was
a part of a heavy storm that extends all
over thp State. For several days past
there /lave been indications that there
was a storm approaching.
Last night's prospects were for a heavy
downpour in the mountains and alonu the
foothills. Those at the weather bureau
predict that the storm will last over to
day in many parts of the State, and per
haps longer. Last evening it was difficult
to predict when the change would take
place that would scatter the storm.

WILL E. FISHER
SUED FOR DIVORCE
His Wife Says He Has
Been Drunk for More
Than a Year.
Going the Pace That Kills on
Money That Was Not
His Own.
Great Mental Anguish Cair.ed to the
Woman He Had Promis'd to
Love and Cherish.
Will E. Fisher, the real estate dealer
who succeeded in spending more money
than he could earn, ha - a new trouble to
face as his wife Rebecca fisher has sued
him for a divorce. The complaint de
manding a legal separation on behalf of
Mrs. Fisher was tiled yesterday by Bishop
& Wheeler, attorneys for Mrs. Fisher, and
thus the expectations of her friends and
relations came true. For a long time
those familiar with the relations of Mr.
and Mrs. Fisher have been looking for a
disruption of the family as it was known
that his habits were not in accordance
with her ideas of right. His indulgence
in Btimulants has been particularly obnox
ious to the lady and all hei pleadings for
him to desist have been in vain.
A friend of the family, who professed to
know the grounds on which Mrs. Fisher
demands a divorce, said yesterday that
she alleged habitual intoxication as the
main cause of the action against her hus
band. She alleges that for more than a
year he has been addicted to excessive in
dulgence in thÂ« flowing bowl, and that in
consequence she das suffered great mental
anguish. He has been incapacitated for
the proper discharge of his duties as a
business man on many occasions, and to
this is attributed some of the acts that
have brought him before the courts in
civil suits, and also in the proceeding
which seeks to have him arrested for al
leged embezzlement of $1688 belonging to
the Wallace estate.
While Fisher has been going the pace
that kills and has been squandering the
fortune which bis wife inherited from a
former husband she has been doing her
best to gather up the loose ends of her
affairs, but all her efforts have been frus
trated by the reckless acts of her spouse.
Patience has ceased to be a virtue, and at
last, for self-defense, she is driven to the
divorce court. Fisher married his wife,
who was then Mrs. Jennings, in 1891. She
avers that since their marriage he has
never contributed anything to the sup
port of the family. In the statement of
his affairs she appears as a creditor for
more than $40,000, showing that from time
to time he obtained cash from her. These
sums went with the lunds of his clients
and patrons to meet the requirements of
his extravagant expenditures.
W. E. FISHER RETURNS
Back From Stockton Accompanied
;by a Private Detective.
Will E. Fisher, the real estate agent
whose disappearance several days ago, in
the face of serious financial embarrass
ments, called forth unfavorable comment,
returned from Stockton yesterday morn
ing accompanied by one Joseph Nye, said
to be a private detective. So much is
definitely known, but both Fisner and his
companion subsequently vanished into
airy nothine, leaving not a rack behind.
It may, however, besalely assumed that
if he did at first seriously contemplate
flight from the inconsiderate demands of
his creditors, second thoughts suggested a
more honoraDle course of action.
The report contained in some of the
evening papers to the effect that Fisner
claims to have been in communication with
his creditors lacks official confirmation.
CharlesS. Neal, who was appointed one
of a committee of three for the purpose of
obtaining from the various creditors as
signments of their claims, with a view to
consolidating the same, professed com
plete ignorance of Fisher's movements,
beyond the information already pub
lished in this paper. "We propose to ap
ply for an assignment to levy on the
assets," said Mr. Neal. "though as yet we
have discovered nothing more tangible
than Fisher's office furniture with which
to meet the expenses of such an applica
tion. We have commenced suit lor office
rent, as is publicly known, and intend to
aerve the necessary papers on Fisher him
self jnst as soon as we rind him. Person
ally I was not aware that he was in town
until I read the eveninc papers."
E. B. Jennings, the stepson of the in
solvent real estate agent, could supply no
additional particulars. Fisher had not
been near the house up to a late hour
yesterday afternoon.
His disappearance dates from Monday
a week ago, ana was first made known id
connection with the suit instituted against
both Fisher and Henry A. Smith by the
special administrator of the Fair estate for
$600 rent due and for restitution of the
premises at 14, 16 and 18 Post street. It is
known that he was in Stockton on the
Tuesday morning, and was there tempo
rarily housed hy Joseph Nye. Both IN ye
and Fisher took passage on the Weber on
Tuesday evening last for this city, and
were recognized by several passengers.
Immediately upon the boat's arrival here
they again disappeared, but whether or
not they have gone into hiding the sequel
alone will show conclusively.
