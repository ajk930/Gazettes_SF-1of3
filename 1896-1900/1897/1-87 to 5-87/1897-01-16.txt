Into Towns.
-_.'â¢ KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 15.â Advices
'!:6m Havana state that the effect of Wey
f ier's famous Bayate edict of the Ist inst. is
\ teing felt with more intensity in the
provinces of Havana and Matanzas than
â¢"in' tbat of Pinar del Rio, since those
provinces, being more thickly populated
and having more farms and estates than
the former, the wholesale abandonment of
the properties and concentration of the
people in the towns will not only augment
misery already prevailing, but also present
the serious inconvenience of lodging so
many people in towns already full to
overflowing.
' Without discussing Weyler's inhuman
measures in thu3 depriving peaceful and
unoffending citizens of their rightful
means of existence and handling tnem iv
already crowded spaces, exposed to all the
rigors of hunger and disease, simply for
the sake of clearing the country of so
called rebel sympathizers, a legal point
has been sprung by the foreign property
owners, especially the Americans who
.own large properties in the provinces of
Havana and Matanzas, which will surely
lead to complications and claims on the
Spanish Government.
Weyler distinctly states iv the decree
that those who wish to remain on their
properties must exhibit the last tax bill
â¢ paid.
As taxes are only levied on productive
industries, and these planters have not
been able to worK en account of the ab
normal conditions in the provinces since
Gomez' invasion in December, ISOS, no
taxes have teen collected since tha; time.
The Government tacitly admitting such
unusual circumstances or being powerless
to collect them while the rebels were in
possession of the country, did not press
their collections, consequently no taxes
have been paid in the country since the .
date mentioned.
Besides that Weyler has unofficial
! ordered that no sugar crop should be ]
r..dde, and now he wants the sugar-plant- !
ers to pay taxes on an industry which j
they nave not been able to produce.
One result is that the manager of the |
sugar estate at San Antonio, near Mad
ruga, Havana, owned by Antonio Terry,
an American citizen residing in Paris,
presented himself to Consul Lee demand
ing protection because the military com
mander ot Madruga ordered him to aban
don the place, which is one of the most
valuable estates in the province, worth
half a million dollars, because he did not
present the required tax bill. Consul Lee
at once took the case in hand, and simul
taneously pressnted the case to the Cap-
I tain-General and the State Department at
Washington. No replies ha.* been received
either from Weyler or Secretary Q;ney.
To depict the situation in Pinar del Reo
noihi-ig can be better said than to trans
late tiie report of a trip made to the city
of that name by a correspondent of La
Luch
"All the way traversed by the railroad
from Artemisa to Conso'acion del Suris,
without exaggeration the most chastised,
has undoubtedly suffered most irom the
ricors of war. The fields wasted and
abandoned; the bushes and trees de
stroyed and the yellow and decayed leaves
strewn by the wind as tears drawn from
the mother earth, pained and anguished
at the folly of men; the huts destroyed;
the stone houses, in other times happy
homes, converted by the hands of rebels
end Spanish alike into heaps of ruins, the
black and fallen walls of which, covered
with lichen, only serve as a refuge for the
lizards and owls; the canefieids, dried up
and covered with bushes by the ravages of
fire; the towns, the authorities of which are
making great efforts to remedy the necessi
ties of I he residents full of people, of poor
lamilies who daily troop down from the
hills, attenuated by hunger and emaciated
by the fevers in such a way that they re
"semble skeletons risen out of their tombs
to appear before the final judgment. To
the right and left of the road as fast as
the train winds its rapid march the trav
eler observes with painful anguish the
desolation and ruin within the inextin
guishable poetry of these exuberant fields,
always green with the eternal verdure of
spring, as if God witb his eloquence would
show us that the only thing we men can
do is to destroy the beauties which surged
from his bounteous will."

MAY AOO.V ESD THE WAR.
Senator Sherman Thinks That Spain
Mil" Grant Autonomy.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Jan. 15.-Senator
Sherman passed through Pittsburg to
night, en route from Canton to Washing
ton. On the subject of Cuba Senator
Sherman said:
"It begins to look as though Spain
would grant Cuba some kind of autonomy
which will speedily end the war. If the
Spanish Government would grant to the
people of Cuba the same rights that are
accorded to the people of Spain it would
have much to do with ending the strug
gle. I am in favor of non-interference
with the affairs of Cuba. About all we
want to do is to buy products of the
island and sell her all tbe goods we can.
I do not believe there is any reliable news
coming from the war.
* "We have no knowledge of what our
representative, Mr. Lee, reported to the
President, except as might be inferred
from the message, and one can readily un
derstand that it might be embarrassing to
him, in his relations with the Spanish
authorities at Havana, if the full text of
his report were made public. We do
know, however, that the reports from
The San Francisco Call.
Cuba, published in the newspapers every
morning, are very unreliable."
"How about an extra session of Con
gress?" Senator Sherman was asked.
"It is absolutely certain that we will
have an extra session, and the earlier It is
held the better. It is very necessary that
we should have a prompt readjustment of
the tariff, and it is probable that the extra
session will be confined to tariff legisla
tion exclusively, though you know Con
gress can consider any subject once it is
called in session."
"Who will probably succeed you, Sena
tor, as chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee?"
'Probably Senator Cushman K. Davis
of Minnesota, though Senator William P.
Frye of Maine is next in order of appoint
ment to a place on the committee. Mr.
Frye, I believe, will prefer to remain at
the head of the Committee on Commerce."
WEYLER _*.*. JHE FIELD.
Marching in the Direction of the Forces
Under Gomez.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 16.â The
Herald's correspondent in Jacksonville,
Fla., telegraphs a3 follows: I have received
a dispatch from Havana which says that
General Weyler has again left that city
with his columns for the field.
This time the captain-general marches,
Havana advices say, in the direction of
the borders of Matanzas and Las Villas,
where Maximo Gomez is supposed to be.
A special cable to the Herald from Ha
vana says: The Rev. Samuel D. Payne,
pastor of a Congregational church in San
ford, Flu., writes to Consul-General Lee to
look out for his son, who he believes was
captured by Spaniards. John W. Sher
man, a Lynchburg (Va.) printer, is also
sought for through the consulate ny his
wife.
REFORMS FOR CUBA.
It Is Alto Reported That Sanguilly May
lie Pardoned.
LONDON, Em?., Jan. 15.â A dispatch
I from Madrid says that the Cabinet council,
| over which the Queen Regent presided,
i has decided to immediately introduce re-
I forms in Cuba. The decree putting the
i reforms into effect will be published on
the King's fete day. The dispatch also
says it is probable that Julio San guilly,
the American citizen recently sentenced
in Havana to life imprisonment, will be
granted a free pardon.
LONDON. Eng., Jan. 15.â The Madrid
correspondent of the Standard confirms
the statement that the Spanish Govern
ment has decided to immediately effect
reforms in Cuba. It is added that the
Government is taking such a serious step
I o.i the event of Mr. McKinley's advent to
j office, hoping to clearly indicate that it
! acted spontaneously in going even beyond
the power voted by the Cortes, for which
'he latter must grant a bill of indemnity.
The reforms will show to what extent the
Government is prepared to go, and that it
i is gradually preparing the colonies for
! autonomy, without yielding the rights of
! Spain and Parliament. It will also soon
; be seen that Spain is disposed to make
j sacrifices in connection with the Cuban
j budget. The reforms will not be realized
â¢a; thou: seriously dashing with Spain's
i material interests. Spaniards look with
j impatience and anxiety to the effect the
! reforms will have in America.
-SO MEGOIIATIOMi MADE.
Premier Co nor us .-.uihorires a Denial
of Published Reports.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Jan. 16.â special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Madrid
says: In regard to the reported negotia
tions with the United States to bring
about peace in Cuba, Premier Canovas
says in an interview published in the Im
parcial yesterday that no negotiations are
going on.
He authorized the paper to deny the re
ports published both in the Spanish and
foreign press. All he knows is that they
are entirely unfounded.
"I have been studying the problem of
reforms," he said, "for some time, and I
will hand the decree to the Gazette when
the moment for enforcing them is consid
ered opportune.
"The reforms will be most ample â more
ample, natuially, than those granted to
Porto Rico. They will, I trust, satisfy the
necessities."
Going to Fitht for Cuba.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Jan. 15.â Second
Lieutenant Charles E. Hays of the
Eighteenth Infantry, who is a native cff
Illinois and rose from the ranks five years
ago, has gone to Cuba to accept a com
mission in tbat army. In his resignation,
which was accepted by the President to
date from January 6, he made no refer
ence to his future movements, but in
transmitting the resignation to his colonel
he said that he was going to fight for
Cuba's freedom.

remained for a week, and will sail for New
York on Monday.
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY 16, 1897.
HOW HAVANA IS FORTIFIED BY THE SPANIARDS
Havana has long bsen rated as one of the most strongly fortified places in the world, and certainly as the second strongest if not actually the first in the
Western Hemisphere. It has been considered as practically impregnable, and justly so if massive stone walls, frowning fortresses and numbers of guns should count
for anything, for with these Havana is most abundantly furnished. Its impregnability to-day, however, against attack by modern means and methods is an open
question. Since its capture by the English in 1762, when the Morro Castle was mined and taken, no attempt has been made against the city, and its powers of resist
ance have remained unproved". Since that time, too. its defenses have been largely strengthened. At the time of the English attack they consisted of the Castillo de
La Fuerza, built in 1530 by Hernando de Soto, on the eastern side of the town, as a defense against pirates who had taken and burned the city two years before; the
Castillo de La Punta and the Castillo de Las Tres Reyes del Morro, at the entrance to the harbor, begun in 1589. after a second capture and sack of the city by the
pirate Jacob Sores. Though often threatened, for nearly 80 years these partially completed structures served to keep off any attack.
In June, 1762, an English fleet of 200 sail, with an army of 14.000 men, under the Duke of Albemarle, appeared off the town. Landing a large force on the coast
east of Murro Castle, they laid seige to it for two months, finally springing a mine and taking it by assault. The city capitulated and was held with the coast from ,
Mariel to Matanzas till the following year, when it was restored to Spain in exchange for the Floridas. vs - , .-. '< ' â  r^?^<Kl '"'"- -'â *- '"â¢-'" -,
Upon their departure the reconstrhction of Morro Castle was begun under the direction of the celebrated Marshal O'Reilly. Also the erection of the fortress
San Carlos de La Cabana, just east of Morro; the fortress of Santo Domingo de Atares, some distance below the arsenal, on the southwestern^end^^th^-j-v^^tph^^*
Castillo de Pnncioe, on & hill about biaii. w?miAjtetMM*m*a. -Xtmm vm* tnu.am fc-ftt-t im _uwHuÃ-*hwl by -WTt, btrt *_*Â«â¢- _e*,n Â«*:â¢_<_Â«- >Â»Â«â¢ . -c â~..
time to time since, and several minor batteries added. San Diego, or Fort Number Four, just east the Cabana, commanding the land approaches from the east as
well as the bay; the Queen's battery, on the northwestern corner of the new town; the battery Santa Clara, ,on a considerable eminence further to the
west, and San Nasario battery, between it and Principe, as well as the battery of the "Twelve Apostles," near the Morro, mounting twelve pound bronze cons;
a water battery, La Paslora, at the foot of the western slope from La Cabana, bearing directly upon the entrance, and Casa Blanca, near the water's edge, further
east. An old tower, La Charrera, stands on the coast some two miles to the west of St. Lazaro cove.
Quite recently new batteries on modern plans and with modern equipments have been constructed one on the coast northeast of Morro and another on a
hill west of Santa Clara battery.
Morro Castle, being an object of much prominence on entering the harbor, is briefly described, as far as can be seen from the outside, by nearly every writer
on Havana, and those few visitors who in times of peace have been able to gain access to the inside have been limited to certain parts of the fortress, commanding
fine views, but affording no opportunities for observing the details as to armament, etc. Its walls are of massive stones and of great thickness, on the scarp being
fully 100 feet high and 50 feet wide on top. There are a large number of old-fashioned 24 and 32 pounders strung around, and lately a number of modern cuns of
high range have been mounted on the west and sea side. The .sea coast battery just beyond, in addition to its twenty-four 32-pounders, has been strengthened with
some Krupp guns. A covered way leads from Morro to this battery, also one to La Cabana fortress, further to the east
The Fortress de La Cabana is the largest on the Island, and said to be one of the best in the whole world. Lite the Morro, the forts are constructed of solid
stone and concrete. They are over half a mile long, and have room for an unlimited number of cannon and accommodations for 4500 men. They mount a large num
ber of old-time cannon, many of them relics of special instances of triumph of the Spanish armsâ bearing such once awe-inspiring names as 'The Thunderer," "The
Peace-maker." "La Terror," "La Destrucion," etc. Newer guns have been added in later years, which sweep the sea to the north, as well as the city to the south,
the country on the lower side of the bay and beyond Regla, and even as far as Guanabacoa, three miles to the east. On the southern side of the fortress the wads rise
right up the bay side, and on the northern and eastern sides are of great strength and height. San Diego, or No. 4, lies about half a mile east of La Ca
bana, and was once quite a strong fort. It commands the land approaches from the east, and has lately been improved and strengthened with new guns.
Of the fortresses on the otner side of the bay Del Principe is by far the largest and strongest. It commands not only the approach by sea and the entrance to ,
the harbor, but also the country around in every direction. It bas been improved and strengthened lately, as have the batteries to the north, intended for sea defense.
The new battery to the west of the Santa Clara has only lately been completed. It is said to be equipped with Krupp and Armstrong guns of late model, and will doubt
less prove to an attacking force one of the most formidable defences of the whole lot. Each of these fortresses has its own Governor or commander, who resides
within its wallsâ all bein_ of course under the Captain-General. La Cabana ana Del Principe are under the command of brigadier-generals of the Spanish army. Morro
has a major; La Punta, San Diego, Santa Ciara, San Nasario and the new battery, captains, and the others, including Atares, on the south of the city, lieutenants.
This grading of the commanders gives some idea of the relative importance of the several fortresses from a Spanish point of view.
Against such appliances as the insurgent army can command the city is indeed impregnable, with La Cabana and San Diego commanding the approaches from
the east and southeast; Atares on tho south and Del Principe and the other batteries to the north of it, sweeping the country to the south and west a_d southwest;
these would render a belt of country encircling the entire city from one and a half to two miles wide untenable by any force, unless advancing by regular siege ap
proaches. Strategy or treachery alone could put any of these strong fortresses in possession of the insurgents. Swift raids might give them temporary possession of
parts of the city, but the whole place is so thoroughly commanded by Dal Principe and Li Cabana that it could soon be destroyed . and burned over their heads.
Other provision is also made against such raid 3. On every road leading into Hivana fortifications have been erected, equipped and manned. Miles of earthworks
have been thrown up, and on every little eminence commanding a half-mile radius a fort has been built of stone and earth and roofed with boiler plate, and having
a lookout on top. Every little cluster of houses on the outskirts of the city, and every plantation near has its little fort commanding the place. These are garrisoned
by from 80 to 150 men, and many have machine guns. Th. approaches to Regla, across the way from Havana, and to Guanabacoa, some three mile* to the east, are
likewise guarded. The su.ar warehouses of Regla are use as forts; barricades of barrels and sugar sacks, filled with earth, built across the roads, and barbed wire
strung on if posts all around the towns to guard against sudden raids.
. Even in the piping times of peace Havana is essentially a military city. The very head of the Government is a soldier, and so on down to the lowest. The
officials are mainly military men. At every corner is a soldier, a sentinel stands before every public office. . Guard reliefs and patrols traverse the streets at all
times. Bugle calls and drum rolls fill the air, and "Quien vive?" "Who goes there?" is to be heard at all times, day and night. The plain answer, "Espana," Spaniard,
or "Forastero," foreigner, is not sufficient, especially at night. If you have no pass, a full and minute explanation must be given as to who you are, and the object
. you have in being on the street. Formerly the answer "Americano" would be enough to lower the challenger's gun instanter and allow you to pass on your way
freely, but now it is the very opposite. The American is no longer popular, either with the "peninsulares"' or Spanish soldiers, or the "insuiares" or those recruited
on the island. Every opportunity of stopping him is seized, and this, with the constant espionage of the detectives who dog the steps of every visitor from the
â¢ United States, makes one feel that he is a persona non grata in Havana. . ,

RETRENCHMENT
HOW DEMANDED
Purchase of the Expensive
Furniture Will Be In
vestigated.
Meanwhile Warrants for Pay
ment Will Be Withheld by
the Controller.
Speaker Coombs Says Plainly That tho
Grind Jury Will Consider the
Expenditures.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 15.âAc
cording to caucus programme the Assem
bly Democrats and Populists roared to
day on the extravagances of temporary
organization. It was acknowledged that
there was no law against the chief clerk
putting 111 attaches on the temporary
roll, but Mr. Shanahan denounced the act
as extravagant beyond all precedent. He
said that the present term was his fifth in
the Assembly. During the session in
which he last served th-s cost of tempo
rary organization was only $600, which
sum was $500 more than ought to have
been allowed. The obvious deduction was
tbat the present Legislature in allowing
$4000 had exceeded a just allowance by
$3900.
While the members were storming
about expenses already incurred and paid,
The Call arrived, containing an exclu
sive account of the reckless squandering
of the contingent fund for the purchase of
costly furniture. Two years ago commit
tee-room lurniiure sufficient to last the
Legislature lor twenty years was pur
chased. Already this session ten expen
sive desks, costing about $50 each, have
been bought for the Assembly, and as
many more for the Senate.
The expose in The Call prompted As
semblyman Emmons of Kern to imme
diately prepare and introduce the follow
ing resolution to investigate the trans
actions:
Resolved, That this House Instruct the Con
troller to withhold all warrants for furniture
purchased during this thirty-second session
of the Legislature, ostensibly for the use of the
various committees of the Assembly, until the
said purchase can be investigated by a com
mittee appointed for that purpose.
The .resolution was not referred to a
committee but was immediately adopted
by the Assembly, and in accordance with.
He p-orUioi** tt*
ment oi furniture "will not be authorized
until all the facts are presented to the
House. Action of a similar character will
probably, be taken by the Senate.
During the discussion on the subject of
the roll of temporary organization Speaker
Coombs announced that he had taken
steps to present the matter to the Grand
Jury should the Assembly fail to investi
gate. Subsequently the Speaker, who had
called Judge Dibble to the chair, said on
the floor that the announcement he had
made with reference to Grand Jury inves
tigation was not intended to prevent in
quiry by the House.
Assemblyman North of Alameda sug
gested that the best thing to do was to
wait until the committee of five to whom
the subject was referred should present a
report.
Mr. Shanahan raised the point of order
that the committee of five represented a
caucus unknown officially to tne Assem-
biv.
"Mr. North did not acknowledge that the
committee referred to was appointed by
the Republican caucus; neither did he
deny it.
The discussion ended by sending the
Dryden resolution, calling for an investi
gation to the Committee on Attaches.
The Speaker indicated that the committee
would report next Monday.
There was another breeze over the San
ford resolution to thank Congress for de
feating the funtiin*. bill and to as_ the
Governor to proclaim a legal holiday in
honor of the defeat. This resolution
emanating from the union caucus of
Democrats and Populists was concocted
for political buncombe. The Republicans
perceived this point yesterday and re
ferred the subject to the Committee on
Federal Relations, Mr. Goodhue, chair
man. To-day the committee reported the
following substitute:.
Resolved, That the Assembly of California
congratulates the people upon the defeat of
the refunding bill in Congress, and earnestly
protests against the passage of any other bill
of like import whatever now pending or to bo
introduced hereafter; that it is opposed to pe
titioning the executive to declare Saturday a
legal holiday in honor of the passage or defeat
of any bill pending in Congress; that the ex
ecutive is vested with power, under section IO
of the Political Code of CalHornia, to declare
legal holidays and suspend general business,
including all industrial pursuits, and should
the executive of this State deem that
such occasion has arisen upon the de
feat of the funding bill, or shoull ha
deem such occasion arises upon the passage
of a protective tariff upon the lines of the
former McKinley tariff law, the executive of
this State, iv the exercise of his discretion,
will doubtless proclaim a holiday; that this
Assembly will aajourn at such time as it may
deem proper in view of the public duties
which may be imposed upon it from time to
time and will remain In session when it can
best subserve the interests of the people of
California. S. E. Goodhue, Chairman.
The reference on the substitute for a
legal holiday in honor of a protective
tariff bill riled Snanahan and other Popu
lists.
Mr. Caminetti asserted that the minority
on the floor had had no opportunity to
study the substitute. Besides, he pro
tested against the action of the committee,
ln his judgment the language of the reso
lution was not respectful. He thought
the Assembly should show more respect
to the Governor. He moved that the reso
lution be recommitted to the committee.
Assemblymen Bridgford, Caminetti,
Shanahan, San ford and Emmons partici
pated in the discussion. Ou the motion to
recommit it North of Aiameda called ths
previous question. The question was
ordered and the recommittal denied. The
report ot the committee was adopted. Mr.
Sanford changed his vote and gave notice
of leconsideration. This indicates that
the minority will renew the fight next
Monday.
Assemblyman Emmons was allowed to
file a protest in the journal to "the effect
that the original resolution introduced by
Sanford was not sent to the committee.
Chief Clerk Duckworth was allowed to
insert in the journal that he sent the
original resolution to the State. Printer in
obedience to the rules of the House and
the law of the State. -
In the field of real leadership Judge
Henry C. Dibble has been accorded the2
first place by almost unanimous consent
*>f the Republican majority. As chairman
Df the Committee ou Revision of tne
Codes he holds the most responsible posi
tion on the floor of the Assembly.
The Assembly Ways and Means Com
mittee last evening voted to report ad
versely on the bill providing for an ap
propriation in aid of the McKinley
protection arch at Washington on in
augural day.
Colonel Henry G. Shaw, who appeared
before the committee to make an argu
ment for the bill, was seen aft*?r the meas
ure was squelched in committee : He said :
"I do not regret the action of the com
mittee. It would have been a quick way
to have raised the money for the arch if
the State had promptly provided for the
expense. This is, however, a business
question rather than a political one, and
the business men of California will appre
ciate its importance because they under
stand it and politicians do not. California
is going to have a great arch on Pennsyl
vania avenue on March 4 illustrating her
magnificent fruit products and other re
sources notwithstanding the refusal of a
legislative committee to recommend a
trilling appropriation for the expense.
"All over the land it has been published
that we are going to mak? a display of
our products in Washington upon tho in
auguration of President McKinley, and I
cannot see now how we can well back out.
The cost would be a mere bagatelle. I can
raise the funds required very easily among
the business men of San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Sacramento, San Jose and Stock
ton. They will realize, without any argu
ment, that there never was presented so
favorable an opportunity to show to the
wealthy people of the East that California
is in the lead as a State fo: climate, soil
and all the comforts of civilization."
Kenyon from the Committee on Con
tested Elections asked the privilege of the
Assembly to conduct the Power contest
in San Francisco. He figured that forty
witnesses coming from that City to Sacra
mento won i cost $9SO, whereas it would
only cost $220 for me committee to visit
San Francisco.
Chynoweth of Anaheim, who seems to
have a grievance against Kenyou for
something which occurred the other -day
when the latter was presiding, strenuously
â¢â bjeVted to any committee junket to San
Francisco.
The San Francisco delegation held a
short session after recess to-day and con
sidered A. 1?. No. '1, authorizing a Japan
ese interpreter lor the Police Court. The
delegation cut the allowance from $150 to
$75 a month and agreed to report favorably
on the measure.

iday Resolution Reported by the
Federal Relations Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 15.â 1n the
Assembly this morning the Federal Rela
tions Committee reported a substitute for
the ling bill holiday resolution, de

them took the first train leading out of
the city. In truth, there was not much
for them to do. the State Printer having
completed only twenty-three out of some
thing like 350 bills, so that there was little
or nothing to do except to adjourn over
and give tho printer's office a chance to
catch up with the big rush of business.
Senator Dwyer's bill (S. B. 60), which
has been referred to the San Francisco
delegation, will prove to be of great in
terest to San Franciscans. It authorizes
the Supervisors of San Francisco to levy
a tax for the collection of $300,000 to be
expended for a municipal hospital to take
the place of the old County Hospital.
Senator Dwyer says that the old hospital
is unlit for habitation, and would long
ago have been condemned by the Board of
Health for that reason, had the board the
power to do so, but it has no authority to
condemn a public building. One of the
internes is said to be sick with typhus
fever contracted by reason of the defective
drainage and sewerage. The Supervisors
are authorized in the bill to select the site.
Another bill by the Senator provides for
the creation of a State inspector for the
Hospital for Infectious Diseases. It is
proposed by the bill that the lepers now
in the Pesthouse in San Francisco shall be
supported by the State, as these lepers
come from all parts of tho" State and from
foreign ports. An appropriation of $100,
--000 is asked for to construct and maintain
the institution, which must be built out
side of the City and County of Sau Fran
cisco.
Senator Luchsinger to-day offered a
joint resolution providing for the deep
ening of the straits leading from San
Pablo Bay to the Mare Island Navy-yard.
The till has been referred to the Commit
tee on Commerce and Navigation and will
no doubt, be reported upon favorably.
Senator Braunhart introduced a bill ex
empting "typewriters" and bicycles from
attachment and execution. The bill will
be probiibly amended by substituting the
words "type-writing machines" for "type
writers." There does not seem to be any
valid reason why typewriters should be
exempt from attachment. This would
work an undeserved hardship upon thou
sands of poor but pretty girls in this
Slate * ,- T â 
Senator Smith of Kern and San Luis
Obispo counties introduced a bill to-day
providing for the appointment by the
Governor of five trustees to serve as a
board of trustees of c. State Normal School
to be established by the bill in the town
of San Luis Obispo, where a site will be
offered free of charge to the State. The
trustees have the option of erecting a new
building or purchasing an old one. Tnere
is some talk among Senator Smith's con
stituents ol purchasing for the purposes of
a Normal School the Hotel Ramona in
San Luis Obispo. The appropriation in
the bill is for $100,000, for constructing,
furnishing and maintaining the school lor
the next two fiscal years.
The Senator is now besieged with let
ters saying that his constituents in San
Luis Obispo County have heard a rumor
that the Senator was about to ask for an
additional Judge in that county and pro
testing against such a measure. The Sen
ator says that there is no truth whatever
in the rumor.
Senator Stratton introduce I a bill this
morning to appropriate $15,000 for a
monument or a statue .to the memory of
Colonel E. D. Baker in Golden Gate Park.
Senator Luchsinger will introduce a bill
next weeK changing the date of State
Labor day to that of the National Labor
day, they being at present a month apart.
One day he thinks is sufficient for work
ing people in California to be docked in
wages for a labor holiday. The Sen
ator introduced a bill to-day reduc
ing the salaries of county officers all
around. "They are now elected for a
four years' term," said the Senator, "and
they are receiving as high salaries as they
did thirty and thirty-five years ago. It is
the sentiment of the people in all the
counties that the salaries are too high."
The bill bus been referred to the County
Governments Committee. He will also
introduce a bill to fee the Tax Collectors
for collecting licenses. At present the
Tax Collectors receive no lee for this ser
vice, and therefore cannot send cut men
to make the collections.
In accordance with a resolution made a
law by the signature of the Governor yes
terday, the bills and resolutions of both
houses are now printed on leaves of the
same size and style as the journals. This
makes the bills much easier to handle and
bind them than tbe sprawling sheets used
at previous sessions.
Jake Steppacher, secretary of the Re
publican State Central Committee, is
studying over the various primary elec
tion bills, so as to blend them harmoni
ously and consistently into one which
shall bo acceptable to the City members
and country members alike. The expense
of holding these elections is a stumbling
block. It is his desire to frame a law
which shall prevent cooked primaries by
allowing all parties in interest to put up a
ticket of their own.
Senator Arms' bill amending the act
creating a Commissioner of Public Works
provides that the Commissioner of Public
Works shall serve for the term of four
years at a salary ol $4000 per annum, pay
able in monthly instalments.!
Another bill by Senator Aram provides
that at the general election in 1902 and
every six years thereafter there shall be
elected a Superior Judge in Yuba County
and one in Sutter County, each to receive
a salary of $4000 a year, half to be paid by
the county and hair by the State. Another
bill amends section 1880 of the Code of
Civil Procedure by the following: "And no
party to an action or proceeding shall be
allowed to testify where the adverse party,
or the party for whose immediate benefit
the action or proceeding is prosecuted or
defended, is the representative of a
deceased person, when the facts to be
proved transpired be ore the death of such
deceased person."
Senator Heard's bill, which has now
been printed, authorizes Boards of Super
visors to "contract for supplying the city
with water for municipal purposes; j to
purchase, lease or construct water works
and electric plant, and all machinery,
conductors and appliances necessary
therefor, and to supply said city with and
to sell to the inhabitants thereof water,
hplir, heat and power."
When the bill becomes a law the city of
Alameda will be the first to take advant
age of it.
Another bill by Senator Beard provides
that a majority of the {"roperty-owners on
the frontage of any road district lying out
side of the limits of an incorporated city
or town, and whose population shall ex- j
ceed 500, may petition the Board of Su- j
pervisors of the county within which said j
road district is situated to have sidewalks
laid or improved. For the purposes of
this act the population shall be ascertained
by taking the great register and allowing
five persons for each elector registered
thereon in such road district.
The meat of the insurance bills intro
duced by Senator Bert is as follows:
No corporation, association, partnership or
individual of any Government foreign to the
United States shall transact insurance business
in this Slate, or be admitted to transact such
business herein, unless it shall have made a
deposit of not less than $200,000 with the
Treasurer of this State or with the proper
officer of some other State of the United States.
Associations of individuals formed upon the
plan known as Lloyds, whereby each associ
ate underwriter becomes liable for a propor
tionate part of the whole amount insured by
a policy,"may be authorized to transact Insur
ance business, other than life, in this State,
in like manner and upon the same terms and
conditions as ara required of and imposed
upon insurance companies of other States of
the United States.
Senator Bert's amendment of the police
pension bill reads as follows:
Whenever any person at the taking effect of
this act, or thereafter, shall have been duly
appointed or selected, and sworn, and have
served for the period of twenty years, or more,
in the aggregate, as a member, in any capacity
or any rank whatever, of the regularly consti
tuted police department of any such county,
city and county, city or town, which may
hereafter be subject to the provisions of this
net, said board shall be empowered to or
der and direct that such person shall
he retired from further service in such police
department, and from the date of the making
of such order the service of such person in
such police department shall cease, and such
person so retired shall thereafter, during His
liietime, be paid from such fund a yearly pen
sion equal to oue-half of the amount of salary
attached to the rank which he may have held
in said police department for the period of one
year uext preceding the date of such retire
ment.
Sec. 2. Section four (4) of said act is hereby
amended so as to read as follows :
Sec. 4. Whenever any person, while serving
as a policeman in any such county, city and
county, city or town, shall become physically
disabled by reason of any bodily injury re
ceived in the immediate or direct perform
ance or discharge ol his duty as such police
man, said board may, upon his written
request, or without such request, if It deem
it to be for the good cf said police force, retire
such person from said department, ana order
and direct that he shall be paid from said
fund, during his lifetime, a yearly pension
equal to half of the amount of salary attached
to the rank which he may have held on such
police force at the date of such retirement, but
on the death oi such pensioner his heirs or
assigns shall have no claim against or upon
such police relief or pension fund.
COMMITTEE JUNKETS.
Members of the Assembly De
termined to Keep Down the Ex- Â«
pense of the Trips.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 15. â The
Assembly Committee on t Commissions,
Retrenchments and Public Expenditure
met this evening to consider junketing
schemes referred to the committee for in
vestigation. The chairman, Mellick, and
his associates have determined to make a
vigorous fight on the floor of the House
against this feature of public extrava
gance. The temper of the committee was
adverse to all trips, but doubt was ex
pressed whether the Assembly was ready
to vote against the whole plan of legis
lative visits to public institutions. If no
other measure of reform can be secured
the committee must sustain a proposition
to limit the number of junketers to three
on each committee, and these three to be
allowed only actual railroad faro and $3 a

day for expenses. Nine committees an
ticipate a junket. â¢
There is sure to be a vigorous appeal
from land-owners ol the Sacramento
Valley for the proposed appropriation of
$300,000 to deepen" the channel of this
stream. There "is a strong influence be
hind the measure and some active work
was done to-day in rallying members to
the support of the bills which were intro
duced yesterday.
In committee Leon Dennery of San Fran
cisco expressed his sentiments with some
animation. He did not pretend to dispute
tbe vitality of the measure, but he was not
in favor of placing the power to appoint
the advising officers in the hands of Gov
ernor Budd.
J. K. Price, chief engineer of the Board
of Public Works, has unbounded faith in
the plan now proposed to secure deep
water navigation -between San Francisco
and Sacramento. In an interview to
night he said there was no reason why
the $200,000 necessary to build one of the
great modern dredgers should not be ex
pended in California. He is confident
that the work can be done at the Union
Iron Works. A dredger with ample power
to displace from the river bed and transfer
to the shore of the stream 8000 cubic yards
of soft mud an hour could be constructed
for the sum named. The greatest obstruc
tion to navigation is the shoal at Rio
Vista, where the depth of water does
not exceed four feet. The shoal is a mile
wide, but could be dredged for a sufficient
depth to float large vessels at a cost not
exceeding $20,000.
Next Monday Senator Voorheis will in
troduce in the Senate two bills and a con
stitutional amendment to exempt the en
dowment ot Stanford University from
taxes. Similar measures will be intro
duced in the Assembly by Malcolm of
Santa Clara. Mrs. Stanford is compelled
to pay taxes amounting to $30,000 on the
property devised to the university. It is
cited as a singular fact that Caliiomia is
more unfriendly to the founders of col
leges and institutions of learning than
any other State of the Union. Rocke
feller's endowment of the Chicago Uni
versity is exempt from taxes. Cornell's
endowment was not taxed, yet the State
of Caliiomia makes the Stanford Univer
sity pay taxes on the entire gift of the late
Senator.
Mrs. Stanford is so hard pressed for
ready money to meet the expenses of the
university that she is compelled to use
the means which she bad set aside to sus
tain kindergarten schools in San Fran
cisco. California, it is argued, has sent
3000 students to Palo Alto, yet Mrs. Stan
ford is taxed by the State for maintaining
this institution of learning to instruct
them. <>
The constitutional amendment will be
so drawn as to exempt from taxation* only
institutions of this character. The ex
emption will not apply to colleges,
schools and academies established for pri
vate gain or institutions conducted by
sectarian societies.
The Capital Deserted.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 15. â The
usual places of legislative congregation
are deserted to-night, nearly all the mem
bers having left for San Francisco and for
the near-by counties to spend Saturday
and Sunday. There are not more than
half a dozen at the prize-fight and about
the same number at the theater. By Mon
day the State Printer will have a large
number of bills ready and the commit
tees will be able to get to work. All indi
cations are that next week will be a busy
one.
Slate Printer Wants Money.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 15.â
State Printer is out of money, and the
Assembly Ways and Means Commit
tee this afternoon recommended an
immediate appropriation of $75,000 for
his office.
FLOATED ON A WIND CAPITAL.
Judge Grosscup's Sharp Rebuke to Coun
sel tor Stockholders in a Swindling
Corporation.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 14.â An applica
tion for a receiver for the Harrison Inter
national Telephone Company by the Fort
Smith (Ark.) stockholders, who sold the
stock of their company in exchange for
Harrison stock, wds heard by Judge
Grosscup in the Federal court to-day.
The occasion was taken advantage of by
the court to sharply rebuke the petition
ers and say some plain things about the
Harrison Company. After reading the
bill Judge Grosscup said he could not con
sider it in its crude, vague form, as "a
court cannot take cognizance of town
meeting allegations," adding:
"This corporation seems to have been
floating on a wind capital of $80,000,000.
It is not as solid as water. Why don't
you ask to get back your stock? You ap
pear here for two men only, not as philan
thropists for the whole public."
"We prefer to appear as stockholders."
replied Judge Erb, the counsel. "This
thing is a gigantic fraud. They elected a
company of men for directors who were
not fit timber for Presidential cabinets â
men of national reputation â Chasles Fos
ter, ex-Secretary of the Treasury; United
Stales Senator Elkins; Patrick Egan, ex-
United S.ates Minister to Chile; R. C.
Kerens ol St. Louis and Major William
Warner of Kansas City.
"These men announced a grand scheme
of conquest. The whole world was to be
seized as a field of operations. The affair
was concocted in sin and fraud."
"In other words," said the Judge, "you
elect to come into court to disclose this
tremendous swindle as stockholders."
Permission was given to amend the bill.

Prospects Good for a Double Lynching
at Adams Park. Ga.
MACON, Ga., Jan. 15.â A special from
Adams Park, Ga. says: Charles Forsyth
and Willis White, the negroes who are
believed to be the men who shot and
fatally wounded Mrs. Rowland, wife of
the Postmaster, while robbing the post
office at this place last night, were run
down by dogs and captured near here
early this morning. Mrs. Rowland died
to-day from the effects of her wound. The
people have begun to gather for the pur
pose of lynching them. The report
reached Macon to-night that a mob had
taken them from jail and hanged them,
but the rumor has not been verified.

ARMY OFFICERS
IN A SCRAMBLE
Retirements and Promo
tions That Will Soon
Occur.
Thankless Patronage Falls to
the Lot of President-Elect
McKinley.
Eligibles Will Not Hesitate to Press
Their Claims Upon the N.-w
Administration
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 15.â A Washing
ton special says: There is going to be a
general shaking up of the army during
1897, and President-elect McKinley will
have the selection of a major-general and
brigadier-general within two months after
he is inauguratedâ March 4, 1897.
Among the general officers the first
vacancy created, on account of reaching
the legal requirement of 04 years, will be
that of Major-General Thomas H. Rnger,
who will be 64 in April, 1897.
A little laterâ May 8â Brigadier-General
Frank Wheaton will reach the retiring age.
There will be a vacancy in the adjutant
general's department after January 25,
when Colonel Oliver D. Green will be re
tired, and September 11 Brigadier-General
Ruggies, adjutant-general of the army,
will be 64 years of age.
In the quartermaster's department there
will be a retirement June 11, when Lieu
tenant-Colonel Louis C. Forsythe will
reach the prescribed age. Within a few
days â January 18 â Brigadier-General
Michael R. Morgan will retire from the
head of the subsistence department of the
army, and his successor, Colonel Thomas
C. Sullivan, will be 64 years of age Novem
ber 4, 1897.
Colonel Charles T. Alexander will be
ineligible for service in the medical de
partment alter May 3, and Lieutenant-
Colonel M. E. Waters will reach the retir
ing age November 15. There may be a
vacancy in the corps of engineers before
the close of President Cleveland's admin
istration, although the chief of engineers,'
Brigadier-General William H. Craighiil,
is not eligible for retirement until July 1
of this year. There was a verbal agree
ment made, however, when he was pro
moted that he would be content with the
office of chief of engineers until the dawn
of 1897. Should he retire there will be an
opportunity afforded Colonel Jobn M.
Wilson, at present superintendent of pub
lic buildings and grounds, to become his
successor, and President Cleveland would
like to make his promotion belore leaving
Washington.
There will be but one change in the cav
alry owing to the age requirement during
1897, and Major James Jackson will be
eligible for retirement November 21.
There will bea chance for several promo
tions in the infantry during this year,
commencing with Colonel James S. Casey,
who will retire January 26. , Captain
Henry Romoyn will follow suit June 1,
and Colonel William J. Lyster June 27.
July 26 will find Captain Francis E. Pierce
eligible for retirement, and the other in
fantry officers who will be eligible com
prise three majors â 0 is W. Pollock,
August 7; Francis F. Lacey, August 8;
Clarence E. Bennett, December 22. Two
post chaplainships will become vacant
this yearâ Captain George W. Dunbar,
March 9, and Joseph H.\G. Irish,
August 7.
From the foregoing list it will be seen
that President-elect McKinley will have
considerable business on hand so far as
the army is concerned, for every one eligi
ble for promotion will not hesitato about
preferring claims upon the new adminis
tration.
PRIVA TE PENSION BILLS.
Most of the Time of ihe House Taken
Up in Their Consideration
Yesterday.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. Allen
(R.) of Utah started business in the House
to-day by presenting a resolution calling
on the Secretary of the Interior for infor
mation as to why patents had not been
issued for land secured by bona-fide pur
chasers from the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, the lands having been given
the company under Government grants.
The resolution was agreed to.
The Committee on -Contested Seats de
cided for Price, the sitting member of the
Third Louisiana District.
Johnson (R.) of Indiana secured the
adoption of a resolution providing for ex
pediting the contested election case of
Benoit vs. Boatner from the Fifth District
of Louisiana, so that it might be disposed
of at the present session.
Quite a little opposition developed over
a resolution from the Committee on Ac
counts for the employment of fifteen fold
ers for two months to refold documents
that had been injured in the failing of a
building during the hurricane here Sep
tember 29 last, and finally the ayes and
noes were ordered on the amendment to
distribute the places among the States
that had no appointments on the roll at
present. The amendment was rejected
and the resolution rejected without an
other rollcall.
The regular order was then demanded.
This was the consideration of private pen
sion bills. An interesting tight developed
over a Senate bill granting a pension of
$100 ncr month to Mrs. Annie Gibbon,
widow of General John Gibbon.
Tracy (R.) of Missouri offered an amend
ment reducing the amount to $50 per
month. This was warmly opposed by
Curtis (R.) of New York, who made eulo
gistic references to the services of General
Gibbon.
Grosvenor (R. ) of Ohio was also against
the bill. He said in answer to Willis (R.)
of Delaware, who protested against dis
crimination for the widows of distin
guished officers, that 99 out of every 100
privates of the late war would vote to give
Mrs. Gibbon the full amount.
Wood (R.) of Illinois opposed the grant
ing of special rates of pension through
the medium of private bills, on the ground
that it was contrary to general law.
The previous question on the passage of
the House bill granting pensions to Gray's
Battalion of Arkansas Volunteers, vet
erans of the war with Mexico, was
ordered, on .motion of Thomas (R.) of
Michigan, but the bill went over until it
could be engrossed, under a demand for
the reading of the engrossed copy.
A House bill to increase the pension of
Clara L. Nichols, the present Postmistress
of Fort Leavenworth and widow of Brevet-
Major-General W. A. Nichols, developed
some slight opposition.
In committee of the whole the House
had reduced the amount ot the increase to
$50, but on motion of Dalzell (R.) of Penn
sylvania the House, after listening to a
eulogy of General Nichols by that gentle
man, made the amount $75 and then
passed the measure. .
A House bill granting a pension to
Sarah E. Comly, widow of Major Clifton
Comly, was also passed. A number of
other private, pension bills were passed
and the House then, at 4:56 o'clock, took
a recess until Bp. m. . ,
At the night session of the House a
round dozen of pension hills were passed.
The widows -ot General Green Clay
Smith and George A. Morrow were bene
ficiaries in two of the bills passed, the
former receiving $50 per month and the
latter $75 per month.
The House at 10:30 p. m. adjourned.
FOR A PACIFIC CABLE.
General Swayne Argues In Fator of Its
Building Being Thrown Open to
Competition.
WASHINGTON,- D. C, Jan. 15.âGen
eral Wagner Swayne of New York, repre
senting the Pacific Cable Company of New
Jersey, appeared before the House Com
merce Committee to-day in support of a
proposition to tnrow open io competition
the building of a cable from the United
States to Japan via Honolulu. All the
cable bills before Congress, he said, rele
gated the details to the Postoffice Depart
ment, thus recognizing the cable as a part
of the postal service. The postal service,
he held, was not required to be remunera
tive, therefore the stipulation to pay the
money of the United States in the form of
a subsidy to the cable company for a term
of twenty years was not strictly a subsidy,
inasmuch as the Government's business
is to be carried during t at period free of
charge. There was no inconsistency in
that, he thought, as the mails were car
ried in some parts of the country by
private parties who were paid for the ser-
In answer to queries from the commit
tee General Swayne explained that the
other company which desired the contract
would undertake to build the cable this
year. His company could not do that.
Neither could his company lay the cable
to Japan and China within seventeen
months from this date. They would not
attempt to do it until the bed of the ocean
had been properly surveyed.
The English ' Government, he asserted,
would not ley their cable if the United
States enters the field. In this connection
he referred to the existing conditions in
the Hawaiian Islands by showing that the
Hawaiian people feel that they may not
long remain an independent country.
He asserted that sooner or later they would
cast their lot with some nation, and that
nation would probably be the one which
would put them in communication with
the remainder of the world and thus help
them to build un their commerce. In an
swer to a query if the men composing
his company were responsible, General
Swayne mentioned the names of some of
the leading incorporators, among whom
were Colonel Spaulding, who had resided
many years in Honolulu and held a con
tract from that Government to lay a cable
to San Francisco. Other members ofthe
company were: D. O. Mills of New York;
General G. M. Dodge, who built the Union
Pacific Railway; James J. Hill, the Presi
dent of the Manitoba Railway ; Abram S.
Hewitt of New York, and others. (
WILL BEGIN IN JUNE.
At Last There Is a Promise That Work
Will Be Commenced on the New
Postcffics. Building.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 15.â "When
do you think construction of the San
Francisco postoffice building will be com
menced?" The Call correspondent asked
the supervising architect to-day.
"You may say to the San Francisco
people that we expect to begin work not
later than June 1," said tnat official.
â¢'Work, has been retarded on account of
the report of War Department engineers
which we are now awaiting. It will be
remembered that agents of this depart
ment caused borings to be mado on the
lot at Seventh and Mission streets and the
board reported that the ground would
support such a structure.
||"Butyou must understand that there
are yet some engineering problems to be
solved. We turn d over to the War
Department the data furnished us by the
experts who made the borings, and the
War Department engineers have been
engaged in maKing calculations of the
weight that can be supported by such a
foundation. The engineers who were
assigned the work of making these com
putations have a vast amount of work of
this kind on hand, and we will have to
bide our time. Just as soon as the figures
are received from the engineers, we will
advertise for bids for the excavation and
the work of laying the foundation of the
building."
"Will any change be made in the plans
of the building?''
"We are aware that many criticisms
were made of the new design, after the
Spanish renaissance, as printed in the
San Francisco Call, and we have decided
to modify the plans by diminishing the
height of the towers. With this exception,
there will be no change in the design."
It is understood that the plan of the
building, with its high towers, as printed
in The Call, were suggested by Supervis
ing Architect Aiken, and that one of the
draughtsmen of his office prepared the
drawings in accordance with Mr. Aiken's
ideas. The supervising architect then
took a vacation for several weeks, and dur
ing his absence the plans were approved
by Chief Executive Officer Kemper, who
was the acting architect and who did not
wish to modify the design of his superior
officer. However, when Mr. Aiken "re
turned and saw the drawing of the build
ing, with its monstrous towers and saw
the severe criticisms published in San
Francisco he resolved to make a change in
the plans as indicated.
XAVAL ARMOR FLAXES.
Se cretary Herbert in Harmony With the
Arte *terl Board.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 15.âSec
retary Herbert has approved the revised
steel specifications devised by the newly
organized steel board, of which Com
mander Coffin, Constructor Dashiell and
Engineer Freeman are members, and in
making them public this afternoon he
says the chief of construction and steam
engineering, the present steel board and
the McCormick board are unanimously
agreed on the changes, which also give
complete satisfaction to the contractors.
The Secretary is confident that under

SOME VERY RAW FAKING.
Out of a Four Line Cablegram the Chicago
Associated Press Sends Columns
of an Alleged Confession.
NEW* YORK, N. V., Jan. 15.â A rare
specimen of reckless faking was furnished
by the Chicago Associated Press on Mon
day in an alleged cable dispatch from
Yokohama, a column in length, four lines
of which were devoted to announcing the
arrest and subsequent confession of Miss
Mary Jacob, formerly Governess in the
family of the late Walter Raymond
Hallowell Carew, for whose murder his
widow is now on trial in Yokohama.
With the exception of this announce
ment the entire "dispatch" will doubt
less be recognized by newspaper readers
and certainly by newspaper workers as a
rehash of the mail matter from Yokohama
concerning the case which has been pub
lished in the American newspapers from
time to time since the death of Carew in
October. Even so it might have escaped
further notice except as an example of
impudence in palming off warmed up
mail communications for genuine cable
news if the faker had been content to
let it go at thai. His delight at seeing
his creation in print, however, made him
bolder and next day he sent out a para
graph, dated Yokohama, of course, mak
ing the positive statement that the trial of
Mrs. Carew had been "brought to a
dramatic close by the appearance and
confession in court of Miss Jacob that
she was the real murderess."
Even this too, might have passed
muster, but unfortunately for the ro
mancer of the Chicago Associated Press,
he took a day off on Thursday when it
appears the office actually did receive a
cable dispatch from Yokohama which
failed to bear out a single particular the
statements contained in the two "cable
dispatches" previously sent out. The
"sub. who was presiding over the
imignation bureau in the faker's absence
was not equal to the emergency and sent
the dispatch out, but he did not make a
column of it. It did not require a column
to inform the clients of the Chicago As
sociated Press that they had been im
posed upon by the faker; that there was
not a word of truth in the statements con
tained in the alleged cable dispatches
from Yokohama. Eight lines were suffi
cient to let the cat out of the bag into
which tho laker had put him. Few
words were necessary to tell that Miss
Jacob had not confessed, "although an
announcement to that effect had been
made public" by the faker and also to
state as a matter of fact that the trial
had not been "brought to a dramatic close,
hut was still in progress."
PACIFIC SHORT LINE.
Road to Be Built From Sioux Ciiy to San
Francisco â Millions Behind
the Project.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 15.â Donald Mc-
Lean, builder of railroads, was in the city
to-day en route to Salt Lake. He is the
promoter of the Pacific Short Line, the
road that is to run from Sioux City to San
Francisco. !i. "' :.
"That road is going to be built," said
Mr. McLean." â  It is now built from Sioux
City to O'Neill, Nebr., and trains are run
ning every day; and, what is more, the
road pays. We will begin building the
extension early in the summer, letting the
bids for its-construction in May.
"The road will be 305 miles shorter than
any other transcontinental line, and it
will traverse a country where the grass
grows, and not a desert. We cross the
Union Pacific on a trestle just east of Og
den, and after we leave Ogden we go off to
the north, and we come into San Fran
cisco around the tanneries, thus, you see,
avoiding the ferry-boat service.
"1 have European backing for $32,000.
--000, but it will not take this much to build
the road. lam confident that it will pay
from the start. As regards terminals and
division points, of course I know where
they will be, but do not care to make them
public now, for obvious reasons.
"We cios* the Pacific slope of the Rock
ies at Beck with Pass and the Atlantic
slope at Sweetwater, and traverse toe
famous Weber Canyon, We will have a
line into Salt Lake and already we have
twenty-five miles constructed.
"I am interested with the George Q*.
Cannon road from Salt Lake to San Diego,
and it is on business connected with this
that I go to Salt Lake."
XOFEL CASE OF DEFAULT.
Why ' a South Dakota Treasurer Was
f<hort in His Accovnta.
YANKTON, S. D., Jan. 15.â The Com
missioners of Yankton County claim that
the retiring Treasurer, D. E. Lloyd, is
$17,000 short in his accounts and will at
once bring action against his bondsmen
to secure that amount. The case is a
novel one in many respects. The deficit
comes from the fact that Lloyd neglected
to collect personal property taxes which
the law of 1893 provides shall be collected.
Lloyd says that the collection of these
taxes would necessarily entail a good deal
of expense, and that as the law made no
provision for recompensing him for this
extra expense he had allowed it to go by
default. The ooard is advised oy the
County Attorney that the Treasurer's
bondsmen are responsible for his per
formance of this duty, and they will not
accept his final report nor release him or
his bondsmen until some satisfactory ad
justment of this matter is made. *The
case will probably be taken into the courts.

FISHERMEN IN PERIL.
Carried Out on Lake Michigan by Drifting
Iceâ Many Rescued, but Five Are
' Probably Lest. *
MARINETTE, Wis., Jan. 15. â About
fifty fishermen were upon the ice at Green
Bay to set their nets this morning, when
a heavy wind sprung up and the ice began
to move out. Boats were sent to their
rescue and all but five ol the imperiled
were â brought ashore in safety. , The
names of the probable victims are: Ed
Hoffman, Nels Matson, Charles Neelan,
Manuel Holgren and Johnson. Three of
them have families.
The men were unaware of their peril
while the ice on which they stood drifted
rapidly eastward. They were several
miles from the break before the rescuing
parties in two boats started after them.
One boat returned with no news. No aid
can reach the drifting prisoners to-night.
All of them live at Menekaune, where the
piers are lined with people waiting for
news. The ice was believed to be safe,
because a team passed over it to Sturgeon
Bay three days ago. Hundreds of people
will be deprived of their only means of
support by the loss of the nets which
were placed on the broken ice. There is
one hope of safety for the occupants of the
ice floe in the fact that they had skates on
and may reach tbe opposite shore. The
fishermen say the only chance of their co
laborers is in reaching Green Island.

737 Market St., .Sau Francisco, Cal.TO BE REFERRED
TO A COMMISSION
Senate Committee on Pacific
Railroads Agrees on a
New Bill.
Similar to the Substitute for the
Funding Bill Offered in
the House.
Senator White Declares the New-
Measure Is a Plan Arranged
by Huntington.
WASHINGTON, D. c, Jan. 15.â The
Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads
after a long session this morning agreed
to report favorably the Gear bill providing j
for a commission, consisting of the Attor- I
ney-General and the Secretaries of the
Treasury and Interior, for the setilement
of the debts of these roads. The bill is
similar to that introduced in the House;
and is identical with the substitute which j
was offered in the House by Harrison on ;
Monday when the refunding bill was de- I
feated.
At Morgan's suggestion the following
proviso was added at the end of section i,
which fixes the basis of settlement, and
with this agreed to the bill was ordered
favorably reported by a unanimous vote:
"That said Commissioners, in making
eny settlement under this act, shall re
serve to Congress the rieht to regulate or
prescribe the rates of toll? or charges for
the transportation of freights or passen
gers to be charged on any or all of the
said railroads and all other lights and
powers in respect of said railroads and
railroad companies as they now exist."
Concerning the bill for a commission to
settle the Pacific railroad debts, which
was reported favorably to-day by the Pa
cific Railroads Committee of the Senate,
Senator White said to-night that he was
convinced that this was Mr. Huntington's
plan. HÂ» does not favor it and is re
solved that it shall not pass the Senate if
he can help it. The fact that Senator
Morgan has been brought around to the
support of this proposition is rather dis
couraging to the Californians, but there
are other good men in the Senate, such as
Senators Allen and Pettigrew, who can
be aepemled upon to assist Senator White
in his fight against the bill.
It is understood that Senator Morsan is
not irrevocably committed to the Harri
son bill, although he sug rested an amend
ment to it at the committee meeting to
day. Senator Morgan and Judge Maguire
will have a conference and may decide to
press the bill authorizing and directing
the Attorney-General to bring suits in the I
Court of Appeals in the District of Co- j
in mb : a.
The Call correspondent to-day inter- j
viewed a number of members of the
Housj on the proposition for a commis- |
sion, and finds that the new bill, ii it is
reported to the House, will meet with
practically the same opposition that the |
funding .bill encountered, it might prob- I
ah prove a little stronger than that bill, I
but it 13 double*!. The assertion is made |
to-day by well-posted men that the Pa- I
cine Railroads Committee of the House is 1
wasting time in attempting to agree upon
a new bill of any kind.
A heavier proportion of the opposition
also comes from men who do not want to
bother with the question a~ain, and who
assert that there is sufficient law on the
statute-books now to protect the interests
of the Government and the roads.
âº- tome quarters the new bill is char
acterized as the last efforts of the railroads
to delay a settlement with the Govern
me:,'. The charge is made that a com
mission would take some years in reaching
a settlement, if it could reach it then.
The roads, it is said, are as able to settle
now as they will be at any future period.
If it is ascertained that the opposition to
the new bill is about as great as to
the former one it is doubtful if the Com
mittee on Rulc-s will agree to a day or two
for consideration of the measure. They
will take it .-a us 'less waste of time.
Representative Meiklejohn oi Nebraska,
wbo opposed the funding bill, states that
fie will also oppose the new measure be
cause he is satisfied that the Government
can foreclose its inortzages and get all or
most of what is due. He believes that
there would be bidder* for the property.
These bidders, he thinks, would represent
Eastern roads which want a through iine to
the Pacific Coast. Representative Pendleton
and Cockreil of Texas both expressed op
position to the new bill, stating that it is
unnecessary. Judge Cockreil says that
commissions for such purposas are worth
less affairs. Judge Pendleton thinks that
the Government can get at least two
thirds of the amount due it under fore
closure proceedings.
Concerning the report that a New York
syndicate has made an offer for the Union
Pacific the Post says this morning:
"In addition to the announcement made
yesterday morning of the efforts of the
New York syndicate to gain possession of
the Union Pacific road the Post is enabled
this morning to present the exact details
of the proposition which has been made to
the Government. The net balance due
the United States by the Union Pacific is,
in round numbers, $53,000,000. In addi
tion to this there is the sinking fund of
$17,000,000. The syndicate proposes to
make its first bid at *"_-- 000,000, or if the
value of the sinking fund is desired by the
Government io be coverÂ»d into the treas
ury $45, 000,000 will be offered. In either
event the total is $25.00*J.0G0 less than the
net debt or the net debt and the sinking
fund combined. Of coarse if there should
be another bidder at the sale, either repre
senting home or foreign interests, the
syndicate would be prepared to raise its
figure.
"I is learned that the syndicate, which
is an open one, includes Morgan, the
Vanderbilt interests and a large number
of financial leaders and trust companies
of New York, and has already secured the
underwriting of about $40,000,000 in the
fnrtherance of its enterprise. Nothing
will be done by the Attorney-General in
the direction of instituting foreclosure
proceedings until he is thoroughly satis
fied that he had a guarantee of the largest
bid which can be obtained. In other
words, he will not institute procesdings,
and have the sale of the road declared,
only to find that the Government inter
ests have been sacrificed. Foreclosure
proceedings are mandatory under the law
unless some other legislation ls enacted to
take the place of the law of March 3, j
1837." â¢ . â  {

CONFIDENCE IS RETURNING.
Comptroller Eckels Anticipates No More
Bank Failures â Business, He Says, Is
Bound to Improve.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 15.â Comptroller
James N. Eckels was in the city to-day
signing checks for the first 50 per cent
dividend to be paid to the depositors in
the National Bank of Illinois.
"My coming on here and spending five
days in signing these checks," said Mr.
Eckels to a reporter, "saves about $2500 to
the creditors of the bank, as if the checks
were sent to Washington and compared
and signed there it would take from five
to ten days longer. The interest on
$4,003,000 for five days at 5 per cent would
amouut to auite a sum. I sent my chief
clerk on ahead to compare the checks, aid
when everything was ready I came here
to sign them.
"Mr. McKcon, the receiver, will be
ready on Monday to pay oat $1,000,000 as
the hrst dividend of 50 rer cut. That's
pretty quiet work, paying a dividend
within tuirty days after a bank is closed.
"When the bask closed its liabilities
were estimated at $12,000,000, but these
have been scaled down to less than
$10,000,000, and there is money enough on
hand to pay 50 per cent of this amount.
There is no telling wi.at the bank will
realize. It will pay the depositors, I be
lieve, every cent, and the stockholders be
lieve there will be something left for
them.
"As to the situation, I think there will
be but few more if any bank failures.
Confidence is returning, and busines* is
bound to improve in the near future. I
am satisfied that the outlook is much
brighter than it was."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
JOHN SHERMAN
TO BE PREMIER
Accepts the State Portfolio
in the McKinley
â  Cabinet.
John Russell Young and Ex-
Governor Long of Massa*
chussets Also Slated.
Senator Burrows of Michigan Trying
to Secure the War cretary
ship for Alger.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. Senator Sher
man, who this afternoon authorized the
United Associated Presses to positively
announce that he has accepted the port
folio of State, and ex-Governor John D.
Lone of Massachusetts, who will in all
probability be in Major McKinley's Cabi
net, sat down at table with me President
elect to-day. The other guest at luncheon
was Senator Burrows of Michigan.
Senator Sherman arrived at the house
about an hour and a quarter before noon
and left for Washington at 2 o'clock. He
had a long talk with Major McKinley. and
they discussed many men and measures.
The formation of the Cabinet was the
main topic of conversation. Senator
Sherman said appointments and the or
ganization ot the work in his department
would not be considered till after the in
auguration of Major McKinley. It is un
derstood that the appointment of a Secre
tary of War was not discussed to-day. but
the gossips have it that John Russell
Young of Philadelphia is under considera
tion. Senator Sherman was in excellent
spirits and seemed full of vigor.
The visit of ex-Governor Long, follow
ing so closely upon that of Senator Lodge
of Massachusetts, is construed to mean he
is not unwilling to accept a place in Major
McKinley's Cabinet. Senalor Lodge as
sured Major McKinley there were no ob
jections to the appointment of ex-Governor
Long on the part of Massachusetts Repub
licans, and it may be deemed reasonably
c rlain that he will be the New England
member of the Cabinet.
Major McKinley and Governor Long
had a long talk and the latter left for the
East this afternoon. It is not thought
that the particular place in the Cabinet
which is likely to be offered Governor
Long has been determined. No tender of
a portfolio was made to-day. Long said
he simply came to confer with Major Mc-
Kinley.
Senator J. C. Burrows of Michigan came
to see the President-elect in the interests
of General R. A. Alger, whom he hopes
will be appointed Secretary of War. Sen
ator Burrows said the Republicans of
Michigan had counted upon General
Alger and that ne had the hearty indorse

not indicate that the portfolio had been

pretty strong here that it will be. The
differences that existed between Senator

happily adjusted and form no obstacle
whatsoever to the appointment of General
Alger to the Cabinet. This is stated upon
high authority.

The Late Henry C Benson, Pioneer Minister.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Jan. 15.â Rev. Henry C. Benson, a pioneer Methodist minister of this
const, died at his home at Santa Clara at 1:15 o'clock this morning after a long and pain
ful illness from a complication of diseases.
Mr.* Benson was born at Xenia, Ohio, in 1818. He worked his way through college and
in 1842 was graduated by the Indiana Asbury University, now know as De Pauw University.
In 1842 he was admit ed to the India Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church,
and in the following year was transferred to ihe Arkansas Conference, having accepted an
appointment as missionary to the Choctaws. In 1845 he was transferred to the North
Indiana Conference and resumed the pastorate. In 1850 he was appointed professor of
languages in the Indiana Asbury University, which institution subsequently bestowed
upon him the degree of D.D.
In 1852 he resigned his professorship to come to California. He landed In San Fran
cisco early in the spring of 1852. He served as pastor of various important charges and
as presiding elder until 1864, when he was selected by the General Conference to the
editorship of the Pacific Christian Advocate at Portland. Or., where he remained for four
years, declining a re-election and also the presidency of the Willamette University to ac
cept the editorial chair of the California Christian Advocate, which he filled for twelve
successive years.
He returned to the pastorate ln 18S0 and remained in active service until a few years
ago, his semi-centennnial of work as a minister of the Methodist chuich being maae the
occasion of a fitting celebration by the conference then in session at Pacific Grove. He
was always an ardent supporter of the University of the Pacific and for many years one of
its most efficient truseees. A widow and nine children survive the deceased.
The funeral of Rev. Dr. Benson will take place at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon at the M.
E. church in Santa Ciara. It is expected all the prominent Methodist ministers in this section
of the State will be present. . .

It is stated that six powers have already

Receiver Anderson Talks of the Affairs
of the Union Pacific.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 15.-E. Ellery
Anderson, one of the Government direct
ors and a receiver of the Union Pacific
Railway, was asked to-day what he
thought of the proposed commission to be
composed of members of the Cabinet to
settle the indebtedness of all the bjnJ
atded railways. He replied:
"I am, and have been all along, in favor
of the foreclosure of the mortgag-* and the
sale of the property, providing there i 3 a
guarantee of a reasonable bid. So far as
the outcome is concerned, 1 think the
Government ought to realize from the
Union Pacific Railroad from $40,000,000
to $45,000,000, including the $16,000,000
now in the sinking fund. The whole of
the Union Pacific's indebtedness to the

BAA KERS ARK ANXIOUS.
! Want to Find Out the Condition of Cuba
Before Loaning More Money.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 15.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: A
: banking firm of this city has received let
, ters from Paris, London and Berlin asking
! to be informed as to the real state of af
i fairs ,in the island and the prospect of
i speedy pacification of the provinces of
i Havana and Pinar del Rio. These letters
are from bankers who have been ap
; proached by agents of the Spanish Gov
! ernment to negotiate a new loan of
' $50,000,000 for the expenses of the war in
i Cuba, giving as security an additional
; issue of the mortgage bonds of 1895 at 5
; per cent interest, with the guarantee of
I tne customs revenues in the island.
The Spanish agents have declared the
pacification of P.r.ar del Rio is a fact,
though it is impossible to proclaim it be
i cause martial law is necessary there, mas;
-; much as a few bands of bandits still re-
I main, and the pacification of the province
': of Havana will soon be accomplished.
The answer given to these letters means
the failure of Spain's negotiations. The
! banking firm referred to has informed its
correspondents that the pacification of
Pinar del Rio is far from being a fact, and
1 that in Havana province the war is as hot
j as ever, and extends even to the suburbs
! of the capital itself.
But even though this were not so, the
! Havana banker adds, the proposed secur
ity for the desired loan is no security at
j all. The customs revenues are pledged to
] pay the principal and interest of the
bonds of 1386 at 6 per cent, and so are the
\ ordinary and extraordinary taxes of the
, island. The bonds of 1895 are practically
only a second mortgage. Besides, neither
j Cuba or Spain is able to pay the $40,000,000
of the Cuban debt.

"It may sound like nonsense, but it is

BONANZA FIND IN
MARIPOSA COUNTY
Mine Owned by Fresnoans
Will Yield Enormous
Returns.
Gold Streaks in Decomposed
Slate That Was Believed
Valueless.
Assays Show That a Ton of the
Quartz Is Worth Six Hundred
Dollars.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 15.â The Mariposa
County mine, in which Dr. E. C. Dunn
and Attorney Mark Walser of this city
are interested, has turned out to be a
bonanza. The fact has been established,
and the two Fresnoans will be men of
fortunes in the near future. It has been
Discovered that a formation of decomposed
slate, which was struck in the mine and
considered entirely worthless and a seri
ous obstacle to further penetration of the
mountain, abounds in gold, assaying
nearly $000 a ton.
The owners of the mine had considered
that they were expending money on
"dead work" in digging out the slate, un
der which, according to mineral laws,
they expected to find a vein of gold ore.
The obnoxious formation was extensive,
and the owners believed they were having
very hard luck, as they believed that a
large amount of money would have to be
expended to get through to the gold-bear
ing stratum. But it has turned out that
the slate is very valuable. The discovery
was made through the curiosity of Attor
ney Walser, who sugeested that a few
samples of the "stuff" that had given so
much discouragement be assayed.
The owners could hardly believe it when
the assaver said the rock was worth on an
average ss94 a ton. Computing according
co the average of the several assays made
the amount of "dead work slate already
on the dump at the mine will yield about
$75,000. The formation still in the moun
tain is a larire one, and if it all contains
gold of a $600 ratio the mine is a veritable
bonanza.
The name of the mine is "Contention."
It was purchased last April by the present
owners. It is located about twenty miles
above Coulterville.

Declares on the Gallows That
the Doom He Faced Was
Merited.
History of the Criin<! for Which He
Suff?red ths Ex'reme
Penalty.
NAPA. Cal.. Jan. William M. Roe,
the murderer of Mrs. Greenwood near this
city six years airo, lias paid the penalty for
his crime. To the end the assassin main
tained that careless demeanor that has
puzzled even the prison officials, who are
accustomed to mingling with men of his
class. It was not a spirit of bravado that
upheld Roe as he ascended the steps of
the scaffold, it was utter disregard for the
coming of death. He went to his doom as
one who had no regrets for the past â no
lean for the future. On the* gallows he
ihanked the prison officials for having
treated him kindly said that he deserved
death, and then the trap that >3ent his soul
b'fore its Maker was sprung.
There were many visitors, most of them
Sheriffs from other counties, who had
come to witness the execution. A crowd
of curious people was at the jail last even
ing to see and talk with the condemned
prisoner. Hoe seemed the same as ever.
He joined pleasantly in the conversation.
Not until after 2 o'clock this morning did
be retire to his bed. About 4 o'clock he
awoke, and from that time until morning
he tossed restlessly about, sleeping but
little.
This morning be seemed as well as ever
nnd pnrtook of a hearty breakfast. About
10:30 o'clock C. J. Beerstecher, who had
defended Roe when the murderer was
tried befcre Ihe Superior Court, paid a
farewell visit to Hie prisoner. Roe was in
his usual good spirits. He shook hands
with his attorney ami again 'har.ked him
for the defense made at the trial. Roe
said:
"1 am ready to die. Every one has to
die some time and my time has come. 1
might as well die now as any time and 1
wish they would hurry up."
Shaking hands again, Roe bade farewell
to his attorney.
The trap on the scaffold was again tried
at 10 o'clock. All the arrangements
proved satisfactory, and the Inclosure was
immediately cleared of all persons but the
officials and the carpenters. This was

"Thank you; youhavedoneyourduty."
He remained sitting in his chair and
manifested no feeling whatever. He was
quiet during the reading and was the
most unconcerned person present. He
felt sorry for the olficers for the duty they
would have to perform, but for himself
be had no pity and asked none.
The inclosure was well filled, there being
nearly 400 spectators. When the doors
were closed at 11:16 o'clock the visiting
Sheriffs were escorted to the scaffold by
Sheriff McKenzie. They took their places
in the rear of and around the trap. At
11:25 the spectators were requested to pre
serve silence and to remove their hats.
A minute later Sheriff McKenzie, followed
by Roe, at whoso side walked Under
Sheriff Robert A. Rrownlee. with Wall
Kennedy and Captain Kettle of the Salva
tion Army bringing up the rear, walked
down the covered entrance. Roe's hands
were bound, but he smoked a cigar and
smiled at the crowd. There was no step
more firm than his as ho mounted the
gallows platform. He was directed to
stand upon the trap, and as he was being
placed in position be looked at the spec
tators and remarked, nervously though
smilinely :
"Kind of monotonous," following it
with a "Hello!" to a familiar face in the
crowd.
Sheriff McKenzie asked, "Is there any
statement you wish to make?"
"Haven't much to say," replied Roe;
"only wish to give my thanks for the way
I have been treated ; treated me well, and
this man here (indicating Wall Kennedy),
this man has helped me out considerably.
I have no creed or kin or anything like
that, so 1 think that is all I want to say."
Sheriff McKenzie and Under Sheriff
Murderer Roe, Smoking a Cigar, Calmly Ascended the Stairs to the Gallows in Napa Prison. Of Those Within
the Inclosure He Was the Most Unconcerned.
Brownlee adjusted the straps' binding
Roe's limbs.
"I got a paper I want to give to the
turnkey later on." said Roe.
Sheriff McKenzie took a paper cut of
Roe's inner pocket and handed it. to Wall
Kennedy.
During all of the proceedings Roe
puffed away on his cigar, bending his
head down as low as his knees to occa
sionally remove the weed from his mouth
with his pinioned bands.
"Good-by now! ' said Roe.
"The lord bless you!" said Captain
Kettle.
Captain Kettle offered a prayer. Then
Sheriff McKenzie placed the noose over
Roe's head and adjusted the knot. Under
Sheriff Brown lee placed the black cap over
the murderer's bead and the spectators
heard the muffled admonition from the
condemned man to the Sheriff to "draw it
tight."
The Sheriff gave the signal, by raising
his band. The trap was sprung at * 11:31
o'clock, the body shot down and Roe's
earthly career was at an end. He neither
kicked nor struggled. Dr. Hennessey was
in charge of the body after that time. He
was surrounded by other physicians. The
body hung motionless except as it lightly
swayed to and fro. Just nineteen minutes
alter the drop Dr. Hennessey pronounced
life extinct. The corpse was not immedi
ately cut down, however, two photographs
of it with the officers and physicians be
ing firs' taken. A few minutes later
Sheriff McKenzie severed the rope with
the knife taken from Roe when he was
arrested. The lifeless clay was taken in
charge by Coroner Keyser. It will be
shipped to San Francisco and will there
"in the interest ot science,' as directed by
Roe in bis lifetime, be given over for
special examination of the brain and other
organs.
Captain John Q. Greenwood, husband
of Roe's victim, quietly witnessed the exe
cution from a point near the gallows.
Koe was a remarkable criminal. He
made a confession to Sheriff McKenzie,
which that officer will not give in its en
tirety for publication, because of the im
plication ol other criminals yet at large.
Roe confessed to having participated in
no less than twenty-six murders, besides
other offenses of lesser magnitude. The
crime which lie to-day expiated on tbe
scaffold is remembered not only, by the
George S. McKenzie, Sheriff of
Napa County.
residents of Napa County but of the whole
State.
About dark on Monday evening. Febru
ary '.), 1891, probably between 5 and 6
o'clock, Captain Greenwood was coming
toward his house from the barn, situated
about seventy-five yards in the rear of the
dwelling. He was surprised to meet two
well-dressed strangers advancing toward
him. He was still more surprised to see
both immediately raise pistols, which
they pointed at him and commanded him
to throw up his band**. Seeing that he
was in the power of the strangers the cap
tain did as he was ordered. The next
command was to give up his money, to
which he replied that he had none.
Captain Greenwood was by his captcrs
escorted into the kitchen. There he was
tied hand and foot with vineyard twine or
strands of bale rope, and his hands and
feet were triced up together, leaving him
in an entirely helpless condition and
cramping his limbs so badly that they
gave him severe pain after being in the
position a short time.
From a small, square bottle be was then
forced to take several swallows of what
proved to be some sense-destroying drug.
Mr. Greenwood soon found that he was
becoming unconscious. White he was
being bound in the kitchen his wife, who
bad been to a neighbor's after a newspaper,
drove up and Itaving her horse standing
walked up and opened the kitchen door.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 18, 1897.
Just as she did so one of the men stepped
out and attempted to seize her. Mrs.
Greenwood stepped backward and fell
from the porch into the flower-garden be
low, a distance of about four feet. So impet
uous was his onslaught upon her that her
pursuer could not stop himself and he also
fell, alighting on the woman. He arose
and dragged her up on to the porch and
into the kitchen, where, with his com
panion's assistance, her hands and feet
were tied similarly to her husband's and
a draught of the drug was forced down
her throat.
Captain Greenwood had sufficiently re
covered from the opiate by this time to in
quire if his .wife was hurt.
"Yes," she replied, "I am hurt badly."
More of this drug was administered to
both and the woman was carried into the
room adjoining. Then Captain Green
wood lost consciousness from the effects
of the drngs administered to him and
kne.v no more lor the time.
Captain Greenwood regained conscious
ness about 11 o'clock, and with a mighty
effort broke the cords which bound
his feet. Then he crawled to the
door, braced himself and managed to
get to his feet, though his hands were
bound behind his back. His first thought
was for his wife, and he entered the bed
room to find her lying dead upon the bed.
He went into the hall adjoining and was
again confronted by the two fiends in hu
man shape. They knocked him down,
and while he was lying on the floor shot
him twice in the side of the head, one ol
them cursing him as he shot.
"Though not at the time entirely uncon
scious the captain feigned d ath so suc
cessfully that they left him, though
taking the precaution to bind and gag
him. The men left the house, took Mrs.
Greenwood's horse and buggy, the animal
having remained standing where she had
left it, and made good their escape.
Captain Greenwood lay bound and
gagged until 7 o'clock in the morning,
when be again succeeded in petting his
feet free, and walked for a distance of
about 100 yards to the gate fronting on
the highway. A neighbor. Hugh Kelly,
came along and saw him. Kelly removed
the gag and heard the story of the horri
ble crime. He at once alarmed the neigh
borhood and sent, word to Sher .ft' Mc-
Kenzie.
The gag was a piece of a small broom
handle, wrapped in cloth torn from ono
of Mrs. Greenwood's white skirts, and
tied with a piece of window cord similar
to that used in binding Mrs. Greenwood's
bands. Captain' Green was shot
twice in the left side of the head, as has
been stated. One bullet passed downward
into the mouth, and was, with a tooth
which it had loosened, spit out on the hall
floor. The other ball ranged upward,
and was removed from the side cf the
head, where it had imbedded itself in the
skull. It was of a smaller size, showing
that each man lired a snot and that their
revolvers were of a different size.
Several years passed away beforo either
murderer was caught. Then Schmidt,
while intoxicated, told a Denver saloon
keeper of his part in the crime. His ar
rest and conviction followed.
Liquor was also the undoing of Roe.
He confided in Los Angeles to a man
who sold him liquor, He was arrested
several months ago and promptly tried
and convicted. His execution to-day was
the last act in the tragedy, or series of
tragedies.
Roe was not in theory or practice a
Christian. He expressed a belief in the
doctrine of reincarnation and refused to
receive visits Irom priest or minister,
though frequently requested to do so. Roe
professed a regard for tho feelings of his
relatives, and it was, he said, in deference
to them that he consented to receive
members of the Salvation Army. The
words of cheer they gave him were not
heeded by the condemned man, as he said
he felt secure and satisfied in his belief,
but he listened to what the Salvationists
had to say respectfully.
Roe's regard for his mother was rather
remarkable. Reference to her was the
only thing that moved him during the
trial, and to the last he seemed to main
tain this regard. When being tried a let
ter was received from his mother, in which
she said she did not believe her boy was
the" murderer lie had confessed himself to
be. She thought he was either crazy or
pretended to be. Roe was offered the let
ter, but said he would not read it, as it
would maka him feci badly.
There does riot seem to ha7e been any
thing in: the parentage of Roe which
would reconcile the theory of hereditary
depravity in the murderer. The mother,
for whom be entertained a regajd, was the
wifo of a man named Basil Roe. She
married in Ohio. Roe deserted his wife
and came West. He is thought to have
been killed in Nevada. Mrs. Roe went to
live with her foster parents named Blum,
and the condemned murderer accompan
ied her. He disagreed with Mrs. ilium
and left home. This was the beginning
of a life of wandering which ended to-day
on the trap. Roe had a grandmother of
easy virtue, and to her is attributed his
traits.
I Roe was very glib of tongue and de
lighted in telling of crimes he bad com
mitted. Had his record been what he
painted it, he would have been a leader
among murderers; but investigation
showed that while he had led a life of
crime and spilled much blood, he, in many
cases, lied abo\t his escapades. Phy
sicians spent considerable time in locating
his abnormal points as indicative of so
called degeneracy, but Roe had all the
characteristics of a manufactured degen
erate. Dime novel reading started him
on an imaginative career of crime, and
vice, principally the opium habit, aided
him in realizing the aspirations to be a
criminal. He displayed the instincts of
the opium fiend rather than of the "de
generate" in his statements to the last.
Roe was prone to confess to his misdeed*).
He said he had had a number of esca
pades at the home of his youth, which
were, on investigation, found to be pure,
labrications. He later said he had killed
a number of Indians and white men in
Idaho, and had been sent to the peniten
tiary for shooting a bartender.' He served
a term for shooting the bartender, but the
other statements could not be verified.
It, is certain that Roe committed at
least one murder other than that of Mrs.
Greenwood. His victim was a peddler he
met on the road near Barstow. He mur
dered him and left his body to the coyotes.
He robbed the body of jewelry and other
possessions of tbe peddler and made his
escape. Though one of the feet of the
murdered peddler was found by some
prospectors a few weeks after the murder,
nothing was known of the murder until
Roe made his confession. A search then
disclosed the skeleton.
Roe was 44 years of age, but despite the
wear and tear of a rough life he did not
look to be more than 35. He was born in
Ohio and came to this State in 1873. He
spent much of. his time since then in this
State. ; '

IN UKIAH JURORS' HANDS.
Twelve Men Deliberating Upon the Fate
of Rancher Mudgett's
Slayer.
UKIAH, Cal., Jan. 15.â The fate of
John Dodge, the self-confessed slayer of
Rancher Mudgett of Usal, now rests with
a jury. At a late hour to-night twelve
men were still deliberating, with little
likelihood of their reaching a verdict be
fore being locked up for the night.
The entire day was consumed by the
argument of Senator Johnson on behalf
of the defendant and by District Attorney
Sturtevant on behalf of the .people. Late
this afternoon Judce Mannon delivered
his charge to the jury, and at 6 o'clock
the case was sti omitted. During the argu
ment of the Distr.ct Attorney, while the
latter was scoring Dodge for his cold
bloodedness in shooting Mudgett and
afterward robbing him and burning the
body, the defendant for the first time
during the trial relaxed his customary
stoical expression and the tears came to
his eyes. His mother, a rather intelli
gent-appearing old Indian woman, sat be
side him and to all appearances did not
realize what was transpiring. His lather,
who is one of the pioneers of the county
and was formerly a wealthy man, sat out
side the court railing And appeared to be
the most interested of all.
San Dienana Will Xot Ratify.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Jan. Efforts
have been made to get up a mass-meeting
to ratify the defeat of the funding bill,
but they met with failure. The business
people generally opposed such demon
stration because it could accomplish no
good purpose, in their estimation.
Another reason for indifference is that
negotiations are pending to induce the
Southern Pacific to build to this place,
and such opposition at this time would
have anything but a beneficial effect.
There are many who favor the defeat of
the bill but do not care to make public
demonstration of their feeling.

NIELSEN FREED
BY JUDGE BUDD
Stockton Jury Directed to
Acquit for Lack of
Evidence. v
Former Employers Fail to Prove
That the Bookkeeper Was
an Embezzler.
.
Had Accused Him of Stealing Thou
sands of Dollars From the
F.rm.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 15.â Edward C.
C. Nielsen, who was charged with embez
zling thousands of dollars from the plan
ing-mill firm of Thomas & Buell of this
city, was acquitted to-day by a jury, by
direction of Judge Budd, before whom the
case was tried. Nielsen was for years head
bookkeeper and cashier of the concern.
When it was tnought by the firm tnat he
bad been taking money systematically
from the cash of the* house he was dis
charged, but it was not until after he had
been away for some time that a warrant
was sworn out for his arrest. He had dis
appeared, and many believed the popular
accountant bad committed suicide.
Sheriff Cunningham located him in San
Luis Obispo County, where he was passing
for a laborer. When it came to the trial
of Nielsen, Thomas & Buell could not pro
duce sufficient evidence to show that their
former trusted bookkeeper bad ever taken
money, as the members of the firm and
others had had access to tbe cash drawer.
Judge Budd ruled every bit of the testi
mony for the prosecution out, and directed
the jury to acquit Nielsen.
The case has aroused great interest here,
on account of the prominence of Nielsen
and the large amount alleged to have
been taken during a number of years.
CIA IMS THE KASSOI. ESTATE.
Alameda Man Declares He Was the
Dead Rancher's ton.
STOCKTON. Cal., Jaa. 15.â A petition
for a stay in tbe distribution of the estate
of George M. Kasson, deceased, filed by
Attorneys Denson and De, Haven to-day,
promises to create a sensation in this
county. Several months ago, Kasson,
one of the wealthiest ranchers of San Joa
quin County, died leaving an estate valued
at $250,000. At the time of toe filing of
the will for probate there war* a great con
troversy among attorneys as to who would
represent the absent heirs, of whom there
are a number in the Eastern and Middle
States.
The estate was about to be distributed
when George H. Llndy of Alameda, to-day
throiiÃh his attorneys, petitioned the Su
perior Court to cite all the claimants to
show cause why it should not all be turned
over to him.
The petition is very brief, but it alleges
that Lmdy is the only and the legitimate
son of the wealthy San Joaquin rancher.
Kasson was always neld in high esteem
in this county and no one, not even his
intimates, ever heard of his having a son
by a former marriage or otherwise. For
this reason the petition causes much com
ment here. The claims of L'.ndy will be
bitterly opposed by the heirs named in
the will.

ENGLAND VS., AMERICA.
The Extent of the Coffee Habit.
When one notices the difference in the
average people of England and America
regarding their diet and digestive abilities
some natural inquiries come up. What
does the Englishman eat tbat gives him
such good digestion, and what is the rea-
son for so much dyspepsia among
Americans?
Rudyard Kipling makes out a "pie belt"
through New England and says its path-
way is strewn with dyspeptics. The
American's love for lard-loaded pastry is
probably the cause of some trouble, but
the apparently harmless coffee is without
doubt the fatherof more stomach troubles
in America than any other item of food or
drink. Great Britain consumes about
30,000,000 pounds of coffee annually, while
America disposes of something like 330,-
-000,000, nearly or quite eleven times as
much.
Analytical chemistry discovers the same
poisonous alkaloids in coffee as are found
in strychnine, morphine, tobacco and
whisky.
These slight poisons taken daily accum-
ulate until the effect on the nerves and
stomach is pitiable with some people (who
are peculiarly susceptible to poisons), the
doses are continued irom day to day with-
out knowledge of what is so surely destroy-
ing the power of nerves and stomach.
It is a trial to give up coffee, but a new
beverage has made its appearance on the
market, which is so like Java coffee in its
deep seal brown color and assuming the
rich golden brown of thick Mocha when
cream is added, that lovers of coffee who
are denied its use, because of the effects,
can adopt this new food drink freely.
The change in taste is so slight that many
do not discover that any change has been
made. The new product is called Postum,
and it is asserted by the manufacturers,
the Postum cereal Company Limited,
Battle Creek, Mich., that it consists
wholly and solely of wheat and other
cereals, carefully cooked and roasted in
different ways. When tbe parts are
mixed or blended a perfect breakfast bev-
erage, it true health coffee results, which
contains the nourishing and healthful
properties of the grains intended by
nature for man's subsistence.
It is worthy the trial of any one who has
trouble with coffee, or whodesire** to recu-
late their habits with due regard to health
and longevity.
There is but one genuine original Pos-
tum Cereal coffee with a multitude of imi-
tations offered as "just as cood."

A LEGAL HOLIDAY
Defeat of the Funding Bill
to Be Celebrated
To-Day.
â â  I - â  â 
Lieutenant-Governor Jeter Will
Preside Over To-Night's
Meeting.
Speeches by Prominent Peop c, Mu*ic
ani Fireworks Will Make Up
the Programme.
At the request of prominent citizens,
among them Mayor James D. Phelan,
who desire to celebrate the defeat of the
funding bill, Governor Budd has declared
to-day a legal holiday.
His proclamation, issued late yesterday,
is as follows:
Whereas, The people of the State of Califor
nia have, by petition, by ina=s-meeting and
through the "press, urged Congress to defect
the Pacific railroad funding measure; ana
whereas, in this Mate the conventions- of the
great Natiunai political parties hare, througn
their platforms, declared strongly against â¢
such refunding schemes; and whereas, the
. present Legislature lias (as did its predeces
irs), by a unanimous vote, instructed the
Senators from California and requested its
.Representatives in Congress to use all honor
able means to defeat the railroad funding bills
pending in such body; and whereas, the House
of Representatives of these United States, in
compliance with the expressed wishes, peti
tions and instructions of this State aforesaid,,
did on the llth aay of January, 1897, refuse
to pass the fat-ding bill then pending in said
b dy, and did defeat the same; and whereas,
it is meet and proper when the United States
Congress acts on the petition of a State in a
matter of such grave importance that the ap
preciation of such State should be expressea
in a befitting manner;
Now, therefore, by reason of the premises
and for the purpose of voicing the apprecia
tion and pleasure of the people of this State
over the compliance of the # House of Represen
tatives with .our express request, I, James H,
Budd, Governor of the State of California, do
hereby proclaim and appoint Saturday, Janu
ary 16, A. D. 1807, a legal hollo ay.
In witness whereof 1 have hereunto set ray
hand and caused the great seal of the Slate of
California to be hereunto affixed this 15th day
of January, A. D. 1897.
James H. BrDD. Governor.
L. H. Brown, Secretary of State.
Owing to the fact that the news of the
proclamation did not reach the City Hall
until many of the municipal departments
had closed for the day, some of the offices
will be open for business this morning,
but all will close early.
At the celebration this evening Lieuten
ant-Governor Jeter will preside. Governor
Budd was asked to occupy the seat of
honor, but he was compelled to decline in
order to fill an important, engagement at
Stockton, and suggested the Lieutenant-
Governor. The latter, in response to a
telegram, said that he would bs pleased to
come down from Sacramento to take part.
The following will deliver five to ten
minute speeches:
Hon. E. W. McKinstry, Congressman-elect
de Vries, Senator FraiiC-, Hon. George A.
Knight, Hon. John T. Doyle, Hon. Adolph

STIERLEN'S LETTERS.
Ex-Judge Sanderson Testifies He Placed
Them in the County Clerk's
Offlce.
Ex-Judge A. A. Sanderson appeared in
Judge Belcher's court yesterday in re
sponse to a citation served by Attorney
Monteith touching certain letters hitherto
offered in the case of Alfred Isson against
George Stierlen. . â¢
Isson sued Stierlen, his brother-in-law,
alleging that Stierlen had alienated the
affections of Mrs. Isson. To prove this
assertion he produced some letters that
were written by Stierlen to Mrs. Is
son. The letters fell into Isson's hands
by reason of tbe fact that his wife was
drowned at sea while on her way from San
Francisco to their home in Mexico.
Attorney Eisner, representing Stierlen,
began to make technical objections to the
examination, but Judge Sanderson asked
that no objection be placed in Mr. Mon
teijh's way. He said the letters were
placed in his keeping by the attorneys in
the case; that they were called for by the'
Unite! States postal authorities, and sub
sequently were returned to him, after
which he placed them among the papers
in the case in the County Clerk's office.
He does not know what has become of
them since, but Believes Mr. Monteith
could find them if he made a caieful
search.
Judge Belc' er remarked that he had no
objection to the making of a statement by
Judge Sanderson, but it appeared that
Mr. Monteith had not laid a proper foun
dation for the present inquiry, and the
motion to produce paperA would' be de
nied and the citation discharged.
THE BILL-POSTEBS MEET.
Elect Officer*, I>IÂ«oum Art and Catchy
Things Generally in Advertising.
The members of the Pacific. Coast Bill
posters' Association, representing the
States of California, Oregon, Washington,
Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah,
met at the Russ House yesterday after
noon and last night. W. H. Lee of Santa
Rosa, the president, called the meeting to
order and made a brief and interesting
speech setting forth the progress made in
the art of bill-posting. The reports of the
secretary and treasurer showed the asso
ciation in a healthy condition financially
and that there were sixty-five members,
with many applications from persons de
sirous of becoming members.
Officers were elected for the ensuing year
as follows: W. H. Lee of Santa Rosa,
president; W. G. Humphrey, Stockton,
vice-president; J. H. Simpson, San Fran
cisco, secretary; W. A. Caswell, Sacra
mento, treasurer. . â¢
Modern methods in bill-posting were
discussed." It was Drought out that one of
the most vital tilings in reierence to bill
posting was to furnish vouchers to adver
sers showing. that the bills ordered, had
actually' been posted and where the post
ing was dona. Invitations were received
from the theaters offering seats to the
members. An invitation* was also ex
tended by the California Adsigns Com
pany for a drive in the park to-day and a
luncheon at the Ci iff House. These will
probably be accepted.
Emergency Home Benefit.
An entertainment will be given January 21
for the benefit of the Emergency Home. The'
programme is as follows: Overture, Blah
chard's orchestra; Girls' Alumna? Glee Club,
under the direction of Philip Wand and Stuart

WATCHING FINANCES.
Supervisors Will Retrench to Avoid
Deficiencies in Municipal Funds
During. tÂ«e Year.
The proceedings of the meetings of the
committees, of tie Board of SuDervisors
suggest that retrenchment in municipal
offices and departments will be the order
for the present at least.
The Finance Committee at its session
yesterday arranged for a meeting in the
Mayor's office with President Sabin of the
telephone company. Supervisor Rottanzi
has taken the lead i*n economy in the
matter of telephones' and will try to see
that a contract advantageous to the City
is made. -â,*';
The bills for meat/ furnished the jails
were c.osely scrutinised and signatures
withheld. The iceman's account for cool
in * material for the .filter in the Clerk's
office was also the subject of comment. It
was thought that f- a month was too
much and that the expense. must be cut
down.
The Street Lights Cofmmittee is also pre
paring to retrench. Tl;ie overdrafts on the
street lights fund haa left very little for
the new committee to ': work on for some
time to come, and the. matter will be re
ported at the next meeting of the board
with a suggestion that, all light, that can
be dispensed with be turned off.
The committee will probably recom
mend t'. at during the night of full moon
and for two nights preceding and follow
ing full moon no light ts be lit. By this
means a further deficiency may be avoided.
OAKLAND CREEK BRIDGE
The War Department Grants a
Fifteen Months' Extension
of Time.
The Cost of $80,000 Will Be Borne
Equally by Alameda County
and the Railroad.
The probability is that there will be only
one new bridge acinus Oakland I Creek,
between Oakland and Aiameda, instead of
two. Word was received at the Southern
Pacific Railroad offices yesterday that Sec-
retary of War Herbert had granted an ex
tension of time in which to arrange the
proposed consolidation of the Alameda
County Supervisors and the Southern
Pacific in regard to th. construction of a
combination bridge. . The original time
would have expired next August, but the
extension gives about fifteen months from
this date in which to construct the bridge.
The next thing in order now is a con
ference between the Supervisors of Ala
meda County and the Southern Pacific
officials in regard to ! the plans of the
bridge. .No time has : been set for this
meeting, but it will doubtless be held soon,
as all the time granted' will douotless be
consumed.in building the bridge. " -
The combination bridge will be one of
the finest in the State. 'It will be a steel
structure with stone ahutments. The
draw will be 150 feet wide. The cost of
the new structure will be about $80,000.
The location of the bridge has not yet
been finally determined. It may replace
the present structure at Webster avenue
or be built between that avenue and Alice
street. â¢ . *â â  'â¢ . . -
The plans will, in all probability, be
made by the Southern Pacific. No work
to speak of has yet been done upon them,
and the details are therefore not deter
mined. It is considered probable that
the wagon and pedestrian floor will be
above the railroad tracks-"-".''-', .* ;>-".L;-\

GREAT JOY IN CHICAGO.
Mr. Plotke's Anii-Hai-in-the- Theater Or
dinance Becomes a Law
Right Away.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 15.â The ordinance
passed by the City Council two weeks
ago against the wearing of head
gear in theaters and % amusement bouses
during the performance, and mak
ing the management liable to a fine
of $25 for each offense, was vetoed by
Mayor Swift to-night, and a, substitute
ordinance less sweeping in its scope was
passed and signed by the Mayor.
There was some question as to the le
gality of Plotke'a anti-hat ordinance, since
it provided no penalty against the wearer,
and to-night Mayor Swift suggested a sub
stitute. The* penalty is directed '.against
the woman who persists in wearing her
hat at a theater, making her liable to a
fine of $3. :â¢;:
The management, by the new ordinance,
is exonerated from any responsibility.
The ordinance will go into effect , to
morrow. . '.''â¢'â 
By. the terms of the ordinance the per
sons cuiity of the offense are not to be in
terrupted during the entertainment. < *
At its completion an officer may be
called and* the guilty one, if she desires,
may pay the fine then* and' there to tho
police and receive a receipt for it. In this
way she can escape arrest.
Wild Flight of an Electric Car.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Jan. 15.â morn
ing, an electric car on the Pennsylvania
avenue line became uncontrollable on ihe
heavy grade on West Main street. It was
impossible to stop its wild flight. When
the car struck the [ Thirty-fifth street
curve it was running at a frightful speed,
it left the track, . crashing into a large'
telegraph pole at' the curb. The car was
split in twain and the passengers hurled
in' all directions. The car was pacKed with
passengers, and , there ' was the wildest ex
citement, amounting to a panic. It was
miraculous that there was not loss of life.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
BE MAY SING
"ROSIE O'GRADY"
A Jury Decided This Yes
terday With Very
. Little Delay.
Little Johnny Robertson's Sweet
Songs Are Not to Be
. . Suppressed.
One Striking Instance of How Juries
Will Decline to Enforce an* .
Unpopular Law.
Police Judge Campbell and a jury of
men, tried and true, spent all yesterday
afternoon trying to discover whether W.
H. Leahey of the Tivoli had committed- a
grievous crime by paying little 12-year
old Johnny Robertson $15 a week to sing
: 'Rosie O'Grady" in a spectacular extrava
ganza called "Jack and the Beanstalk."
The jury ignored the technicalities of
the law and set the Tivoli people free, on
the broad ground that the evidence
showed that the agents of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Children origi
i nally investigated the cape and said there
: was no violation of the law.
There is in this State a law which makes
I it a crime, per se, as the lawyers say, to
| hire any person under 16 years of age to
sing on a stage. â¢ The law was originally
passed by the staid old citizens of the
New England States, who anciently
looked upon theaters as allies of the evil
one. The following gentlemen as jurors
freed the defendant in less than two min
utes: Richard Rosing, Dan Mahony,
Horace Wilson, Monroe. Harris, E. B.
Clausuns, J. J. Crow.J. D. Long, H. Wall,
S.Jonas. M. Collins, N. Wertz.
The law plainly says tbat any person,
whether parent, guardian or employer of
any child under the age of lfi years,- who
shall "exhibit, use or employ said child
in the vocation of singing, playing or
walking a rope," shall, etc., etc., be con
! sidered a criminal, and as such be subject
| to puni-jhment. But the jury would not
i enforce the law, would not have the ver
i diet the way of the code.
. There was absolutely no contest about
the facts in the case. The boy swore he was
12 years of ape, that be sang night after
night at the Tivoli, that he was hired and
i paid so to do by the managers.
Manager Leahey swore to facts com
pletely corroborative of the boy's story,
adding that Secretary Holbrook, Officer
McMurray and others of the society had
seen the performance and decided that it
was not objectionable; that ihey had al
lowed Gertie Carlisle and other children
to sing at the Baldwin and elsewhere
without molestation, and had pounced
j upon the Tivoli.
Attorney Jobn T. Dare spoke with due
j dignity for the Sti*.te. Attorney Loewen
; thai, ior the theater, took the broad view
! that the lav**** was ridiculous, praised the
proprietors of the theater for the charities
and the case was won.
Manager Leahey swore that the child
was not overworked, and the boy said: "It
is a pleasure to sing, your Honor." It
j waa shown that the boy is getting a musi
i cal education at the Tivoli; that he goes
! home at 11 p. m. nightly with his mother
| and gets $15 a week for his services.
THE HOPKINS MILLIONS.
Next of Kin Suing the Chief Heir for an
Accounting Under an Original
Agreement.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 15 -Three
more suits, it was stated yesterday, are to
be brought against Edward F. Searles,
who inherited the Hopkins millions on
the death of his wife, Mrs. Hopkins-
Searles, and incidentally a bit of legal
gossip was made public concerning the
enormous fees . paid the lawyers who
handled the estate. Butler, -Stillman &
Hubbard of this city were afterward en
gaged to manage the vast estate, and it is
now said : that for this service they re
ceived $1,800,000 down and a substantial
percentage of future profits. x
Eugene Hanscheck of the firm of Han
echeck & Norton of 96 Broadway, is au
thority for this statement. His clients
are C. N. and G. J. Hebbard and Mrs.
Amelia Hebbard Wheeler,' cousins of Mrs.
Hopkins-Searles. They were among the
next of kin who contested the will. The
case was tried in Essex County, Mass.,
1892, and Mr. Searles agreed to a settle
ment.
â¢Timothy Hopkins, the adopted son of
Mark Hopkins, and the chief claimant,
accepted $6,000,000, ; and the: Hebbards
say. they were promised $25,000 each by
General Hubbard as their share in the
â¢settlement. ' Some of the money has been
paid them, but the greater portion has not
been forthcoming, they say, and they are
now suing for the original amount^ in the
Supreme Court. The cases, have been
placed on preferred-cases . calendar ; and
will soon be tried. . _..-'
Mr. Bearles is living in Massachusetts.
He has spent about $8,000,000 of the $18,-'
000,000 left him by his wife in hushing the
clamor of ; the several contestants of ' the
will. The estate has 'increased in equal
amount, and be is now amusing himself
â¢by spending some of the millions in build

on an island off the coast of Maine.

SAYS COONEY WAS A TOOL
District Attorney Barnes Thinks
the Case Against Him Is
a Strong One.
No More Arrests Will Bj Mad?. Until
After the Preliminary Hear
ing N.*xt We k.
George Knight and Charles Heggerty
both reiterated yesterday that the arrest
of ex-Notary James. J. Cooney was but
the first move in a series of criminal prose
cutions growing out of the suits brought
by Mrs. Nettie R. Craven against the heirs
to the Fair estate. >^X' r
"I cannot say just when, but all the
parties to this conspiracy will be arrested
in due time we. don't propose to allow
one of them to escape," said George
Knight. "With regard .to James J.
Cooney, we feel rather sorry for him. than
otherwise's We believe he has been the
tool of others. We have absolute proof of
his guilt and, of course, the guilt of the
others. '
"We may or may not have the com
plaints sworn to, and the prosecutions be
gun before the trial of the . ejectment suit
conies on, but in any case the prosecu
tions will be made."
District Attorney Barnes made a state
ment of similar import. He said he had
no hesitation in declaring it as his opin-.
ion that the pencil deeds were part of a
gigantic conspiracy, and that unless he
had reason to change his opinion all the
parties, suspected would be arrested. He
said he did not believe in moving too fast,
however, in such a serious matter.
"I shall try out the' truth of the theory
we are working upon in the preliminary
hearing of Cooney next week," be said.
"If my conclusions le correct Cooney will
be shown to be merely a misguided tool in
thje hands of bold conspirators. We in
tend to exhaust every resource to bring
the principals to justice.
"It will be my duty to prefer additional
charges against Cooney, but I snail do so
only as a matter of form, and I shall ask
the court to allow him to go under these
upon his . own â  recognizance.' Tbe case
against Cooney," continued the District
Attorney, "seems to be impregnable, but
until it is heard and Cooneys given a
chance to explain all the circumstances
that indicate his guilt. I do not desire to
cause any more arrests."

According to one of the Olympic mana

put in its bill for expenses, assuming that
they would probably, be more man those
of tne home .team, the question naturally
arises, Was ihe .game a benefit or an ex
pensive luxury to charity? â¢ -t â . '.t^u^t;
1 Had the match been played as originally
arranged and not as. a compromise semi
professional exhibition, Olympic was to
nave received 35 per cent of the gate re
ceipts. As a charity game, with full
expenses allowed, Olympic would receive
about $-00 more than it would otherwise
have got. ' â :."''â  . -. â¢'â  : --- â  ; j
But the president of the Pacific-Ama
teur Union positively declares that in theÂ«
presence of witnesses he permitted the
game,, with the professionals in it, only as
an exhibition fur chanty : and . with no
other expenses to be considered except
the rent and preparation of the grounds
and the printing of advertisements for tne
game. ' -V. '

Piesident Alien and Secretary Cook of
the suspended Acme Athletic Club ap
peared at the meeting, last night and
placed the responsibility for the club's
suspension from amateur standing upon
the shoulders of one of the Acme Club'
directors, who, it was claimed, personally
and without authority arranged and ob
tained amateur sanction for tlie recent
boxing bout between Tighe and Muller,
which the association declared was a pro
fessional match.
This matter will,' however, be given
another. special hearing at the special
meeting next Tuesday night. The sus
pension, of the Acme Club for thirty days
virtually prevents any of its members
: from competing as representatives of the
club during that time. Some of therm, it
is said, will com pete in cycle-races with
the permission of the representative of
the League of American Wheelmen.
In ; this connection it was stated last
night that the Amateur Athletic Union of
America is at present. taking steps that
will shortly result in an official dissolution
of the alliance that has heretofore existed
between that organization and the League
of â  American Wheelmen. This . in effect
means that hereafter the Amateur Ath
letic Union purposes to be its own judge
of all branches of amateur sports, includ
ing cycling. '

Money Cheaper in Xexo York Than Any
where Else in the Wr.rld.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 15â
weekly statement of the Associated Banks,
to be issued to-morrow, will show a large
increase in the cash on . hand as ' the con
sequence of an unusual state of affairs in
the money market. About a month. ago
the presidents and other leading officers
of some forty banks belonging to the
Clearing-house attended a dinner at the
Union League : Club, given by Henry W.
Cannon, president of tne Chase National
Bank. T''i^ngyWtSM*&JJrlllftllAl^ 1 >yW^WilP'Wlii j__il!3l jjf-ijlt"
.. At this gathering an understanding was"
reached that no call loans, or, in other
words, loans payable on demand, should
be made at a fate less than ' 2 per cent per
annum. For three or four weeks previously
most of the call loans had been made at
I}>_ per cent. At this rate the banks did
not consider that they ; were receiving an
adequate return for their money. â ,< l:i
During the presert week the borrowers,
found that they could obtain money from ;
the trust companies, insurance companies
and other large lenders at 1 per cent. r , ;
Accordingly they shifted their loans to
a large extent; that is, they i paid off the I
loans to the* banks and got - accommo
dated from the lenders, whose rates were
14 per cent lower. The banks secured only:
a small part of the new loans. The ; rapid
accumulation of money in their vaults
which was er.rning not ing at all finally
! brought them to a realization tbat their
' agreement to keep the call loan rate up to
2 per cent could no longer ibe adhered to |
with advantage, and many of them were
accepting offers of 1% percent. : Although i
tne tendency 'i money Jis ..downward all
over the world, it is cheaper in NewV York
than anywhere else, v ;.-

THE CALL -PEAKS FOR ALL.
Well done, Cuba !^_
The patriots are marching on.
The news will stir the Senators up.
Now we know why Weyler returned to
Havana.
Talk of economy in the Legislature be
gins to sound like a roar.'
McKinley is getting his Cabinet work
down to the finishing touches.
It is high time the march of improve
ment started up Fourth street.
The Cubans have taken the war into
their own hands, and may take Havana
also.
Pasadena and Los Angeles are now ad
vertising themselves as tobogganing re
sorts.
It profited Spain nothing ro kill Maceo
and make way for Gomez to come to the
front.
It is" a pity we cannot kill cinch bills
like cinch bugs by a process of white
washing.
There is a chance now that even Cleve
land may* have a new light and recognize
something.
The Park Commission is willing to meet
the' Grand Jury any day and explain
everything.
_â¢ â  â
Every State in the Union is in doubt
whether to trust to- the Legislature for
economy or to pray for it.
General Weyler's campaign seems to
have been just sufficiently aggressive to
make the Cubans red hot.
The Code Commission itself has fur
nished the Legislature with enough food
for thought and study for sixty days.
Let us celebrate the defeat of the fund
ing bill, bur let us not forget that ihe war
is not yet at an epd, and another battle is
sight. ______
The temptations "to rake her" will be
as great with this Legislature as with any
of its predecessors, but let us hope it will
resist them.
Huntington is now in favor of a Gov
ernment commission to settle the Pacific
roads debts. Anything to postpone fore
closure suits him.
# â¢
In the Republican Legislative caucn3 in
New York Mr. Choate had seven votes,
and the world now knows that there are
some mugwumps still living.
People who wish the Legislature to be
economical should begin by urging their
representatives to be economical in asking
for appropriations for their own counties.
We did not need a bureau of highways
to tell us that bad roads cost more than
good ones, but all the same it is just as
well to have the truth repeated in an offi
cial form.
Democrats and Populists will denounce
the Republican majority in the Legisla
ture and charge ti em with extravagance
as a matter of course. What else are their
tongues for?
â *
If California is to have an arch of fruits
and flowers over Pennsylvania avenue on
inauguration day it will have to be erected
by voluntary contributions. The Legisla
ture is not indulging in that kind of State
pride this year. *â ;"*,".
The return of Thomas â¢C. Piatt to the
Senate from New York will be dramatic in
everything except the essential feature of
a drama. The foes who triumphed over
him in the old days are gone, and he re
turns to the arena too late to take up the
old fight and* enjoy a sweet revenge.
The supporter of Joseph H. Choate in
the Republican caucus at Albany who de
clared his name was familiar as a house
hold word throughout the Union, and
then voted for him as Joseph F. Choate,
was most undeservedly laughed at. His
candidate is familiarly known as Joe
Ohoate.
Â«
The bill of Senator Androns making it
a misdemeanor to advertise lotteries or
the results of drawings should find strong
support from all parts of the State. . These
swindling schemes can never be sup
pressed as long as they are permitted to
advertise and delude the people into the
bnhef that they ready pay prizes.
As a result of enforced idleness among
the prisoners of Kings County peniten
tiary in New York there have been
twenty-two attempts at suicide- and three
attempts at murder Within nine days, and
yet in the* New York clubs there are
plenty of fellows who are idle for months
without getting .'.restless-..* The trouble
seems to be with the convicts that the
idleness is forced on them. It is compul
sion that grinds.
If our Scottish fellow-citizens seriously
undertake the work of raising the neces
sary funds to erect a worthy monument to
Burns they will not lack for assistance
from the people generally. Burns is some
thing more than the poet of Scotland he
is the poet of humanity â and all who
value manhood more than rank and title
will aid in raising a monument to him
who sang the great song, "The rank is but
the guinea stamp, the man's the man lor
a' that." : ,
M'KINLEY'S CABINET.
The announcement by-Senator Sherman
that he had been offered ana has accepted
the office of Secretary oi State in the Cab
inet of President McKinley settles the
point of greatest difficulty which has been
experienced in making up the new admin
istration. ' With this office arranged for
the rest of the work of forming the Cabi
net will go forward rapidly and within a
few days we may know who are to be the
heads of all the great departments of the
Government under the new President.
It cannot be denied that the elevation
of Senator Sherman to the office of Secre
tary ol State is something of an experi
ment. The Senator has long been eminent
in finance, but has no established repute
in foreign affairs. Though he has been
lons*; in the Senate and has taken part in
debating all great questions of interna
tional policy which have come before that
body in the last thirty years, he has not
identified himself with any important
measure affecting our foreign relations.
The inclination of his mind has been
toward monetary questions, and it is these
he has chiefly studied. In the prime of
his life as Secretary of the Treasury he
proved himself one of the ablest and most
successful financiers the country has ever
known. It is, to say the least, doubtful
whether iri his old age ho can achieve an
equal service for the Nation ; in the alto
gether different office for which h*_ has
been chosen.
It is certain that as Secretary of State
Mr. Sherman cannot measure up to the
standard of James G. Blame, who cast
such a brilliant luster over the last Re
publican administration. It is equally
certain, however, that he will give far
more satisfaction to the people than the
Democratic Secretaries who preceded and
followed Mr. Blame. He will have more
force and more Americanism than Bayard
and Gresham and 'more experience and
tact than Oluey. He will enter upon his
office familiar with all foreign issues now
under negotiation, and, notwithstanding
his advanced age and predilection for
financial subjects, can be counted on to
direct our foreign affairs, if not brilliantly
at least safely, soundly and patriotically.
It must be borne in mind that while
the Secretary of State is conventionally
regarded as the head of the Cabinet, and is
sometimes spoken of as the American
"Premier," he is officially no higher than
other Cabinet officers, and. the importance !
of his position is determined by the im
portance of the issues which arise for him
to deal with. â  A: the present juncture
there seems no grave crisis to confront a
Secretary of State unless perhaps one
should arise out of the war iri Cuba, and
the recent course of Mr. Sherman in the
Senate gives assurance that he is fully
equal to the task of dealing with that in a
way to maintain the dignity and the wel
fare of the Republic.
f *
The most important place in .the new j
Cabinet will be that of Secretary of the j
Treasury. With so many and such im
portant economic and monetary questions,
to be solved during the next four years,
the head of the Treasury Department will
be in the storm center of Amercan poli
tics and the most conspicuous figure in j
the Cabinet. There is need for a man of
exceptional strength and intellect in that
office. It entails even in ordinary times j
more exhausting duties than any other in i
the Cabinet, sÂ»nd at this time will require \
a vigorous body and rugged health, as well i
as a clear head to perform tho work. It is '
not surprising that in his old age Mr. j
Sherman should have preferred quieter
duties. The country will wait with eager- j
ness to hear who is to have that responsi- |
ble and arduous office. It is the Secretary :
of the Treasury who is to deal with the I
great issuas before the people, and for this i
administration at any rate be the head of
the Cabinet, tha Premier ol the Govern
ment.
THE PARK COMMISSION.
It is to be hoped the controversy raised
over certain expenditures by the Park
Commission will be brought to a speedy
conclusion by an open and public investi
gation of the accounts of the commission.
There is reason for expecting that this
nope will be gratified, since both the Park
Commissioners and those who have raised
the charges against them seem willing to
meet an investigation at one?. B_H
The Park Commission is one of the few
official bodies in which the people have
confidence and which has hitherto es
caped the breath of scandal and been ab
solutely free from * suspicion of wrong
doing. It is, therefore, the more to be
regretted that at this lime anything has
arisen which tends to diminish the faith
which the people have in the commission
and to raise a doubt as to the manner in
which the sums intrusted to it have been
expended.
It is gratifying to note the commission
has expressed a willingness to have a full
investigation made of .all its expendi
tures. One of its members, John Rosen
feld, state 1 in an interview published in
The Call yesterday that if the Grand
Jury wished to have an investigation the
Commissioners are ready at any minute
and willing to give all help possiDle. It is
still more, gratifying to note that at a
meeting of . the committee appointed by
the late Grand Jury it' was stated by E. P.
Farnsworth that he is not prepared to say
but what the Park Commission has done
its. duty. "I do not believe," said he,
"that with their knowledge any crooked
ness or irregularities have been' counte
nanced."
It iB the hope and the expectation ofthe
people that all charges made against the
commission will prove to be ill-founaed.
Our Park Commissioners in the past have
most ably and. economically administered
the funds entrusfd to them. They have
made for us at Golden Gate Park a garden
and a forest of surpassing beauty out of
the barren wastes of sand hills, where it
seemed that nothing would grow. Their
accomplishments have been a source of
civic pride and we have slways taken vis
itors to the City to the park with feelings
of more than ordinary satisfaction. It
would -be a loss to tne community if at
this time we should find tbat this commis
sion also has been guilty of favoritism,
extravagance, or worse, in the performance
of its duties. â¢ v
The issue raised in the controversy is
one of too much importance to be ignored
and certainly the solution of it should not
te postponed. The people, we repeat, ex
pect a speedy investigation and prompt
settlement of the charges. If there is any
thin . wrong it should be known at once,
and if there is not this commission, in
which we have hitherto taken so much
pride, should be restored to its foi mer
position in public confidence.
SENATOR PL ATT.
The return of Thomas C. Piatt to the
United S'.ates Senate will be another illus
tration of the Way tho" whirligig of time
brings about its revenges." In this case, :
however, the revenge will be but a barren
accomplishment. The contests in which
Mr. Piatt engaged when last/in the Senate
are over,* and his foes of those days, like
his colleague, Conkling, have gone beyond
the reach of triumph or defeat. Mr. Piatt
will find himself in office confronted by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
new issues and surrounded by new men,
to whom his bygone battles are but little
more interesting than ancient history.
As a matter of fact the election of Sen
ator Piatt, though it will recall a memory
of his former defeat, has ho association
with it whatever. His success is simply
an evidence that in New York politics the
honors go to the workers. The man who
leads either party in that State arid tights
its battles to a victorious result is the man
whom that party delights to elevate to the
highest.offices in its t-ift.
New York politicians " do not turn
away from their best leaders for . senti
ment any more than for money.
Though among her citizens are the
richest men in the Union, New York
has never been known to send a man to i
the Senate simply because of his wealth
and his business ability. Though it is the
home and dwelling-place of many a
learned and eloquent "scholar in politics,"
it has never chosen one of them for its
high offices. The New Yorkers under
stand that the leadership of parties and
the management of politics are matters of
not less importance than business and
scholarship, and elect to office men who
have shown their fitness toattend to them
with skill and efficiency.
Mr. Choate' who posed as the Republi
can rival of Mr. Piatt, is in many respects
the very opposite of the kind of man that
New York elects to offie?. He is a cul
tured scholar, an able lawyer, an eloquent
orator and an honorable zen, but he
has never made a study of politics, never
assisted in organizing bis party and never
exhibited any great desire for its success.
In the recent campaign, for example,
when Republican workers were every
where earnest and active to win the vic
tory. Mr. Choate did not even make a
speech. He seemed to be utterly in
different to the result aad certainly con
tributed nothing to tho victory.
Such a man would hardly have made a
good Senator even had he been elected. The
man who takes no interest in politics in
private station is hardly likely to take
much when in office and t.he country loses
very little when he is left to follow the
pursuits that are most congenial to him.
The people have no reason to regret the
return of Mr. Piatt to the Senate, notwith
standing he has been so often denounced
as a "boss." He is a man who under
stands parties and politics, and the poli
cies and principles of government. He
will be a strong man in the Senate, and
the Nation, his State and the republican
party will be benefited by his services.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
John P. Wilson, who wrote the fascinating
song, "Dat New Bully,': and whose play of
"Little Robinson Crusoe" has been generally
discussed, is busy with one or two fetching
productions which will probably be published
during the next few months. Mr. Wilson has
devoted a great deal of attention to song
writing and has many interesting and novel
ideas regarding songs that should catch on
with the public. He is the author of the song
"Crappy Sam," successfully sung by May
Irwin, and he is now writing a new burlesque
on "The Prisoner ot Zenda" for the Con
cordia Club. At -the Palace! yesterday, .'in
the company of several friends who were dis
cussing the subject, Mr. Wilson said: ' â¢ â¢ â¢
7"ln the composition of a popular. song but
one question is to be considered: What will
the public take? The author's one aim Is to
find as satisfactory an answer os possible :to
this query and write accordingly. But, alas!
no man has yet been wise enough to prophesy
JOHN p. WILSON, Author of Dat New Bully" and Other Popular Songs, Who Is
Writing a Burlesque. â¢-*; .= "'
correctly as to the likes and dislikes of the
fickle public; so the song-writer must use his
skill and tact, coupled with his experience
and observation, and leave the rest to the
publisher and providence.
"Two points, however, must be borne in
mind, the commercial view, and tho avoidance
of art; for art is not essential for this work,
unless a Happy knack of versifying can be
dignified by that pame, and The general pubic
have little taste for the higher variety. This
statement is only made concerning ephemeral
songs of the day, ior a song to become standard
and live must possess genuine merit in point
ot versification, musical setting, or both. 'Tis
of the popular lyric effusion of which we are
â .peaking, however, and we will confine our
selves to that topic.
"To begin, the writer, observes the style of
the latest song that has met with popular ap
proval, and likely as not appropriates the idea;
or possibly he has a touch cl originality and
copies nobody, though this hypothesis is im
probable. Then comes the choice of a subject,
and though the popular writer should be pro
lific In themes and happy in their selection, a
trivial inciuent may serve as the groundwork
if prorerly handled, or an imaginary one with
a varnish of reality, the thinner the better,
will answer as well, though novel situations
are much sought after nowadays.
"Whatever the theme selected he must make
the lines broad and 'their meaning unmistak
able; the sentiment must be exaggerated, like
the scenes in a melodrama. If he writes. of
love it must be of the fatthful-until-death
varietyâ unworldly, improbable. 'The world
loves a lover,', but for the commonplace wooer
the world has do sympathy, aud in a song the
public's sympathy must be .aroused. The
lover in the lyric must be a bold, handsome,
devil-may-care fellow, and love like Antony.
No half-way business goes with the patrons of
this style of song, and the 'woeiul ballad made
to his mistress' eyebrow' 'for them is played
out. -.'.'â¢â¢
"If a comic song is projected it should be
strictly comic, not humorous; with touches of
horseplay thrown mr- catch words and forcible
phrases.
"For a dialect creation authorities on dialect
can be consulted to advantage, supplemented
by observations of the manners and speech of
the nationality to be depicted, the whole
broadened and boldly accentuated. 7/... -
"In the topical verse everything should be
subsidiary to the climax. The concluding
phra-e should be like the cracker on the whip,
snappy, pungent, startling. Perhaps no style
ot verse is so difficult of construction as the
topical, for tho air is Usually but a vehicle for
the words, its success depending on the ap
propriateness of the theme and the manner la
which it is presented.
"The selection of topic having been made
and the lyric constructed to the best of he
author's ability, It is given over to the tender
mercies of the composer, and if he be clever
and grasps the versifier's idea he makes the
music in concord with the words. We will
draw a charitable veil over the differences lia
ble to arise between author and composer, the
brain torture the latter undergoes in the com
position of a catchy air and accompaniment,
aud imagine the song as a thing complete.
"Then comes the most difficult task of all,
that of placing the song upon the market. If
possible a punlishcr should be found, whose
inherent honesty has not succumbed to oppor
tunity. It is a mooted question among song
writers if- such a one lives to-day, the preva
lent opinion being that, like the dodo, the
species is now extinct if it sver existed at all.
The publisher tound. the next thing is to get
some sinner to give the song to the waiting
public, and it's right here that that important
factor, the 'popularlzer,' gets in his work.
Different iootiight favorites are cajoled, flat
tered, persuaded sometimes by the promise of
a share in the profits ..into 'putting on' the
song, for all interested know that the success
of the bantling is largely dependent upon tho
personality of the introducer. Such a party
being procured, the soug is heard by the
public. ..*â ., Â '
"Apropos, a word or two about songs that
have made money through such instrumen
tality may not be amiss.
"In the song 'After the Ball' - the verses are
beneath contempt, and the air has such a wide
range that the average voice has not the com
pass to, sing it. I once heard, a music hall
singer render the first part in tne original key,
and the retrain a tone lower. Still in spite ol
its bad rhyme and faulty construction, this
song had an enormous -sale, the profits being
variously estimated at from $75,000 to $100,
--000. Another song which has been successful
from a monetary standpoint is labeled My
Mother Was a Lady.'
"It tells the stor y of a girl who came to the
city to seek her brother, and obtained a situa
tion as a waitress. j Fancy the Idea of, laying
the scene of a sentimental ballad In a hashery !
In -the first 'verse the heroine ' with the lady
like mother is rudely .'joshed' by a drummer
she is attending at table,* and the 'josher' asks,
her to marry him in the - third. Talk about a
rapid age, it's alt settled iri five minutes and
in the most | puerile verse ever perpetrated.
Both of these bongs were well introduced, and
to that lact must their success be attributed,
for it would be doing an injustice to the intel
ligence of ; the -American public to say they
were accepted on their merits. â '.'..â â .'.'.
"The 'popularize.' exhausts all the tricks of
his trade to make a song 'go.' The 'b6y in the
gallery' scheme is \ one' of them, though now
hackneyed by overuse. '.' Having the song
illustrated by means of stereopticon views is
another. A favorite method of "gaining that
essential thing, the sympathy of the audience,
is the 'spiel*. before', the rendition of the song.
This consists of a little story of 'how the song
came to be written,' which in nine cases out of
ten is the purest fiction. Nevertheless these
fairy tales are accepted by the majority and
lend a glamour of reality to the song, without
which it would be wholly hollow and artifi
cial. !â -â¢'; .. â  '.' â¢ â¢' â  '
"Such is the story in brief of the popular
song from inception to presentation, with
most of the worry left out, and now- the fancy
of the public must \ determine whether it
stands or falls.
"Perhaps in time to come the criticism of
the general public will grow more acutu and
a ballad will be accepted strict!*,- on its ar
tistic merits, but to-day, as ; belore remarked,
when author and composer have put forth
their best efforts the rest must be left to provi
dence and the 'popularizer'." ' -";>â¢â¢

Letters From the People.
FOURTH STREET.
Improvements , Xeeded .on . That Import
ant Thoroughfare of the City. "
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib.:
It being true that "The CAll speaks for all,"
the mercnants and business people all along
Fourth street would owe their everlasting
gratitude to The Call if it would appropriate
a small space of its valuable columns in set
ting forth to the public the present disgrace
ful and perilous condition of this street,
particularly that portion between Market and
Mission, the cobblestones and loose rocks, the
unevenuess of the grade caused by the raising
of the grade in laying the trolley-car track
rendering it dangerous for teams nnd buggies
to pass over the same without accident. The
attention of the authorities has been repeated
ly called to this matter by the citizens and
taxpayers, but in vain. Smash-ups and break
downs are of almost dally occurrence and- the
real condition of the portion of this street be
tween Market and Mission is actually a public
'shame. Tue business -people *on this street
justly complain that the money of the City- is
lavishly expended on streets and avenues in
the outskirts of the City where there is scarcely
any business or travel, while here, in the very
heart of the City, a street thnt is constantly
thronged with travel is suffered to remain iv
a condition that would be a disgrace to a Hot
tentot village. Not only are the interests of the
citizens on this street involved in the putting
of this street In proper condition, but the pub
lic generally are equally Interested. We hope
through The Call to be able to attract the at
tention of the authorities to the necessity of
moving in this matter. . -'.'â¢*. A. Swift.
OCCULT TEMPLE OPPOSED.
Countess Wachtmeister Sana Mine. Blavat
sky Was Strongly Opposed to It.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: In
your issue of the 30th of December you pub
lished a ino-u interesting article on the growth
of theosophy. Among other items it was
stated thatthe "Blavatsky-Judge faction pro
pose to establish an occult temple." As the
daily companion and student of Mme. Blavat
sky during the last six years of her life I can
' give the.public some very interesting informa
tion lv regard to Mme. Bluvatsky's opinion of
an "occult temple."
In the early days when a group of now well
known men and women were the dally pupils
of our gieat teacher, we asked H. P. B. it we
should get.the money together and buiid such
a temple. Her answer was clear and 'positive.
She said: "By no means- If such a temple is
built it will begin with ceremonial magic and
end in black magic." . '. ;
Whatever temple may be built for occult
practices by people calling themselves . theoso
phists, I beg of you in justice to the memory ol
our great teacher, don't unite her name with
it. : 7 Constance Wachtmeister.

in awarding to Americans the contract for the

All the famous construction works in the

provide these accessions to Japan's war navy.

NO SWANHILDA
The â¢ Hawaiian Isles From
. Newcastle Got in
Yesterday.
She Sailed a Week Ahead of the
Anxiously Looked For â¢
Vessel.
Harbor Commissioners Will Meet With
the Chamber of Commerce .
Next Tuesday. ' .
Meiggs wharf will be the center of at
traction on the water front to-morrow.
Every bark that shows up on the horizon
is immediately set down for the anxiously
expected vessel. The fact that the incom
ing vessel has only three masts, instead of
four, as is the case, with the Swanhilda, ;
does not seem to count, and rowboats,
towboats and police- boats all mak e a race
to get aboard.
When the Hawaiian Isles, from New-.
castle, was sighted everybody made sure
she was the much-desired vessel, and
even|when she was made out all and sun
dry went to her in order to make sure that
she had not spoken the Swanhilda and
that Murderer Butler was not aboard.
Captain Kustel's report is very brief and
is as follows:
Hawaiian Isles, Hawaiian ship, from New
castle. Australia. January 15â Sailed Novem
ber 17; crossed the equator latitude 30 south,
longitude 171 east; then passed westward ot
Fiji Islands; crossed equator longitude. l 77
west, '_!) Jays out; then "had* moderate wiuds
to latitude 30 north, longitude 178 west, alter
which we had stormy weather to port. .
December 2, H. A. Cummings. seaman, a na
tive of Scotland, aged 23 years, -fell from the
fore rieging, a distance ot about '20 feet, and
died from the effects a few minutes alter. He
was buried at sea.
On no occasion was the Swanhilda
sighted, and as she sailed several days
later than the Hawaiian Isles the chances
are that it will be at least next Thursday
before she ran be looked for.
The Alonowai, which arrived from' the
â¢colonies, brought the story about the
Swanhilda having been spoken near Fiji
by the steamer Taupo, so Captain Frazer
must be close behind the Hawaiian Isles,
and as the former is a fast sailer in light
winds she may safely be looked for before
the end of next week.
The Harbor Commissioners held a
special meeting yesterday to meet a com
mitee from the Chamber of Commerce.
The latter was composed of ex-Super-
I visor Taylor, Captain James Chapman,
Hugh Craig and" Captain W. L. Merry.
The gent'emen wished to impress upon
the board the necessity fop a time ball
and a flagpole for the displaying of storm
signals being placed upon the tower of
the new ferry depot. The matter was
j discussed pro and con, and then in order
â  to facilitate matters President Colnon at
the suggestion of Commissioner Chad
bourne announced that the board had
practically decided a fortnight 'ago to
make the desired changes and that the
chief engineer was now at work on the
matter. Mr. Holmes and Lieutenant
Hu lies of the Hydrographic Office will
perfect the plans and then the contractors
will be instructed to make the necessary
changes. .."'.:,<
Before the meeting adjourned President
[ Colnon invited the members of the Cham
ber of Commerce to attend all the meet
ings of the board and make as many sug
gestions as possible, as the commission
wanted all the light possible in order to
properly handle the front. Hugh Craig
responded in kind and asked the board to
attend the meetings of the' Chamber of
Commerce. He was particularly anxious
to have them present at the meeting next
Tuesday, and the chances are that the
Commissioners, will meat early Tuesday
morning in order to be in attendance. On
that occasion the belt railroad will be dis
cussed. .'..''
The battle-ship Oregon made a start on

GEOEGE HAAS' WILL. ;

fortune, which is estimated to be about
$500,000.
Tne remainder of the estate is bequeathed
to relatives and friends, the business and
store of the candy factory being given to
bis three lons, share and share alike. The
eldest son, William, is already in posses
sion of his share of the business, which is
said to be very profitable, as was evidenced
by the substantial estate* left by the tes
tator. The residue of the estate is to be
distributed among the five children of the
testator. IBBgripSfi'ggidgli
A provision is made to the effect that the
testator's children shall not have control
of their shares until they have reached
their majority, and then only subject to
the determination of the executors that
they are fit and proper persons to be en
trusted with the care of property. Mrs.
Amelia Haas, the widow, and William
Gru'enhagen, brother-in-law of the testa
tor, are appointed executors * without
bonds.
The will was executed a week before
Haas' death. .

Captain Lees has been notified from
Denver, Colo., of' the arrest of William
Flannery, a notorious pickpocket, who is

many months ago for picking the pocket
of Mrs. Mary Birch near the Morosco
Grand Opera-house. He forfeited ". his
$3000 bond, and the night before he left
town he plundered tbe house of L. Bur
tin, one ol his bondsmen.

MRS. LEES HAS
PASSED AWAY
She Died Quietly Yesterday
After a Last Short
Illness.
For Years She Had Been an
iQvalid Dependent Upon the
Care of Others.
Tlie Veteran Captain of Detectives and
His Children Were by Her
Bedside.
After a last short illness Mrs. Jane
Amelia Lees passed away yesterday morn
ing. She was surrounded by the mem
bers of her family, aud death came peace
fully after the years of pain she has suf
fered.
The sturdy old captain, hardened in the
contemplation of the sorrows of life, as
THE LATE MRS. JANE AMELIA LEES.
evidenced in his daily routine of business
during the past quarter of a century,
melted away yesterday afternoon in hot
and burning tears as he gazed upon the
features of his life-long companion.
When Mrs. Lees breathed her last
shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon
the captain and his children were at her
bedside. They had been watching there
for many nights and days, expecting the
worst. The unfortunate woman had suf
fered much. For more than twelve years
bronchitis and asthma had held her a
martyr, and in latter months she was nec
essarily dependent upon the care and
affection of her husband and children.
â¢ Mrs. Jane Amelia Lees was a most char
itable woman. Sbe was essentially a home
body, seldom being seen in the â¢ society
circles to which her attainments entitled
her. She had a little coterie of friends
who gathered about her and through
whom she did many acts of benevolence.
She was 67 years of ape and the mother
of five children, two of whom are living.
They are Miss Ella Lees and Fred W.Lees.
Mrs. Lees was a Miss Jane Amelia Fisher.
She was born in Bambrid-*: â¢, Eng:, June 2.
1829. .As a very small child she and her
parents iesid-d in Baltimore, and in 1851
she came to this city as the wife of I. W.
â¢Lees, whom she married two years before.
The police have as yet made no arrange
ments for the funeral, i^i . -
MUSIC JOINS LABOR.
The Local Musicians' Union . Affiliates
*--'. Itself With a National Organ!- â¢
zation of Labor.
The local Musicians' Union has deserted
its old standard and joined the labor or
ganizations of America under a new one â
the American Federation of Labor.
Formerly the San Francisco, musicians
were affiliated with the National League
of Musicians. .In course of time a new
thought showed itself in the ranks of
union musicians and it developed into an
independent body known as the American
Federation of Music. The difficulty be
tween the two branches was that one side
held that musicians are artists, while the
contended that . they are laborersâ
of course, only in the union point of view.
.When the American Federation of La
bor held its convention recently in Cin
cinnati it granted a charter to the Ameri
can Federation of Music and thus brought
the musicians within the 'pale of labor.
Musicians j united with the new organiza
tion will consequently share the benefits
of mutual , assistance in . . case of strikes
because they have taken a stand on the
broad prinoiples of labor.
; ... Delegates from â â * the \ Musicians' Union
reported the change at last night's session
of the San Francisco Labor Council. L.
Linhart, C. fc*'c hup pert', M. Davis, A. Di
jean, Thcraas Ginman and M. Manheiru
were the chosen delegates of the union.
Ironmoldprs' Union No. 164 elected T.
Hurd and William T. Boyce as its repre
sentatives to the council and they were
seated last night. *. ' ?y-.'*; : -^"^
. Communications were rend.from Sacra
mento and -San Diego council, which con -
triouted financial support to the labor
convention to be held in this City in. the
interest of labor bills for the present Leg
islature.
J. Hill was nominated for president for
the next term, C. *E. Hawkes for vice
president, Joseph Walters for financial
secretary and S. Smith for sergeant-at
arms. Other nominations were postponed
.for a week.

WARRANTS FOR
TWO PHYSICIANS
They Failed to Register
Births at Which They
Attended.
Dr. Eidenmuller and Dr. Lowry
Find Themselves Within the
Clutches of the Law.
'â¢ '. â â  "â  â '..-.
The Unfavorable Showing of Births
Against Deaths the Cause of
the New Crusade.
The opening gun of the Board of
Health's crusade against the physicians
who fail to register births, as required by.
law, was fired yesterday when warrants
for two well-known physicians were sworn
out against Violators of the law. '. â 'â ;;"."'â  :â -;
The present board has felt a great deal
of annoyance over the fact that the num
ber of births reported at the Health Office
was alway than the number of deaths,
although it was well known that the
actual number of deaths occurring during
any given period was less than the births.
There is a section of the Political Code
that reads as follows:
Sec. 3024. Physicians and midwives must, on
or. before the fourthday of each month, make
a return to the Health Officer of all births,
deaths and the number .of stillborn children
occurring in their practice during the pre
ceding month. In the absence of such attend
ants, the parent must make such report within
thirty days after the birth of the child. Such
returns must be made in accordance ; . with
rules adopted and upon blanks furnished by
the Board of Health.
The Board of Supervisors has also taken
hold of the matter and passed a more
stringent order, which is as follows:.
Order 2341.* - 'â  ' â ^vi'f*? 1 '
Sec. 1. Physicians and mid wives must, on or
before the fourth day of each month, mÂ«ke a
return to the Health Officer of ail births occur
ring in their practice during the preceding
month. -In the absence of such attendants,
the parent must make such report within
thirty days after the birth of the child. Such
returns must be made in accordance with the
rules adODtt* d and upon blanks furnished by
the Board of Health. . .
Sec. 2. Any person violating any of the pro
visions of this order shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor and be punished by a fine not
exceeding $100 or Imprisonment not exceed
ing ninety days, or by both such fine and im
prisonment.
The board attempted to enforce these
measures some time ago, and caused the
arrest of a physician who had failed to
register a birth at which he officiated. He
was regularly tried before a Police Judge
and convicted. .
Since then, and up to yesterday, though
violations of the law were frequent, no
arrests were made..'
--â¢ The semi-annual report of the board
was recently issued, and the showing of
births against deaths was so bad that the
members decided to make an example of
a, few physicians, and gave orders that
the first cases where good evidence could
be obtained â¢ should be taken into the
courts.
Within the past few days C. A. Blank
and J. G. Barker, have reported that
though children were born to their wives
at comparatively recent dates they were
unable to find any records to that effect.
The physician .who attended Mrs. Blank
was Dr. *\V. C. Eidenmuller of 14 Grant
avenue, and the attendant of Mrs: Barker
was, Dr. E. N. Lowry of 213 Geary street.
On the statements Obtained from . the
fathers warrants were sworn out before
Judge Joachimsen for the two' doctors,
and they will b) vigorously prosecuted.
In future arrests will ba made in all
authenticated cases.

Hugh McDonnell on the Dullness
in the East and Interest
in California.. .
A Crowd of People Coming to invest
â¢ in the God MinesâThis
State in Clover.
Hugh McDonnell," the widely known
mining man, who effected the sale of the
Iron Mountain mines a year ago, and who
owns valuable mini ng property at Copper
City and Tehachapi, returned here yester
day from the East, after four weeks'ab
sence. f â /..â Â£":â  ..:..â¢
: Mr. McDonnell visited Denver, Chicago,
New York and other places of importance.
He says business is very dull everywhere
he has been and that no place in the East
Is to be compared with this country.
â¢'l'll never kick at California again," he
said, expressively; "it's the best place
there is,' go where you will. Business is
infinitely better here than it is anywhere
East. I was surprised to see haw quiet' it
was everywhere. Chicago is quieter than
it was when I was back there in the sum
mer. The banks that have been breaking
there have scared people.
. '.'lt's better in New York. They've got
more ' people there, or . at least more
people go there, ana- they get a show on
their streets, but they are not doing much.
The other cities in the East are dull, too.
"I found there was great interest in the
East in the new mines at Randsburg. I
was asked a great many times about them.
California mining generally. is' receiving
great attention. The East is putting lots
of money in here, as is England and other
countries of â¢ Europe. They are sending
their experts here, and more property will
be bought. The South African excite
ment is off and the mining world is turn
ing to California.
"In Colorado I was much surprised at
the interest in Randsburg. Lots of Colo
rado men have come out and become in
terested in that camp, and they have gone
back and eulogized it as being very rich.
This has started others this way. 7 ,\/ ; '
"I saw nowhere where business was so
pood or money so plenty as in California.
We are really in clover. One is struck
with that when he compares the places he
has seen in the East with San Francisco
and other towns of this State. We are
strictly in it, and I am not exaggerating
a bit when I say so."
Mr. McDonnell will visit his mining

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What ' the Wheelmen, Anglers, Baseball
Players and Riflemen Are Doing*
*'-â  ---Ââ  â â¢'â â â â . .. â - â 
No donbt there will be a large gathering
of the patrons of wheeling at the Velo
drome track to-day to see the races, which
should be good, as the wheelmen who
have entered are considered first-class per
formers.
A rush of anglers to Russian River is ex
pected to-morrow, as latest intelligence
is to the effect that the fishing is first
class.
At Shell Mound Park the" rifles will
crack lively to-morrow, as several- clubs
will be represented before the butts.
Basebalfis looking up and, as the sport
ing public is taking an interest in the
National game, clubs are being organized
in city and country.
There is some talk of a meeting between
the greyhounds of this City and Sacra
mento at Interstate park.
THE WHEELMEN.
Blgr Success Predicted for. the
League Benefit Meet To-Day.
To-day occurs the biggest cycling meet
ever known in the history of the State.
The first blue-ribbon meet ever held here
is to be given at the Velodrome track this
afternoon, and that it has struck a popu
lar chord is evidenced by the immense
entry list of riders and an unprecedented
advance sale of seats. - . .*
The benefit is for the North California
Division, League of American Wheelmen.
The National assembly of the parent body
is to convene in Albany, N. V. ," early next
month, and the North California division
. has several requests to ask of it for the
good of the cyclists of this State. The
board of officers realized that the only
way to get proper recognition was by send
in-*;* a delegation there, and it is for this
purpose that the blue-ribbon meet was ar
ranged. The treasury of the division,
while having some funds in it, was not
â sufficiently plethoric to admit of standing
the expense, so the members, riders, deal
ers and every one interested were. asked to
"stand in".and they have done it with a
wiil. The track was donated by the Velo
drome, the printing, advertising and
music were free by courtesy of different
people, and the riders themselves agreed
to ride, and to ride their very best at that,
for blue ribbons as prizes. Every thine, in
fact, is free, except admission to the races.
There is not a pass extant. Every com
petitor, official and spectator will pay at
the gate and "paper" will be a nonentity.
Furthermore, the largest crowd of the
season and the best races as weil are anti
cipated, and altogether it promises to be a
great meet from every point of view. __SK
The track is at Fell and Baker streets,
and the races will be called at 2 o'clock
this afternoon promptly. Up to the noon
hour seats can be had at Sherman &
Clay's; and after that time at the track.
The two professional events will he a one
third mile scratch and a half-mile handi
cap, and the two amateur events a one
third mile scratch and two-thirds mile
handicap. Then there will be the Velo
drome Shield race between D. E. Whit
man of Los Angeles and. C. E. Dow of
Seattle, and other features -which will
combine to make a most interesting after
noon's sport. !.â *.
The local riders and officials are an
noyed at the lack of support they have re
ceived for this meet from the Garden City
Cyclers of San Jose. As one gentleman,
who does not wish bis name used, said:
"While the . meet will be an unqualified
success without their support, still we feel
that they should have sent us their- riders
and done everything to help the thing
along, as the benefits we expect to derive
from favorable legislation from the Na
tional body will be more to the Garden
City Cyclers than to any club in the State,
as they own their own track and have
such a large membership. They only sent
us one actual entry and two others who
wanted to star when they were not stars
themselves. I really wonder if they ex
pect us to help them any."
This speaker expressed the sentiments
of many others whom I have spoken- to
regarding the meet. There was almost
unanimous support from the dealers, who
contributed toward the souvenir pro
gramme and took quantities of seats* be
sides. The local clubs also took blocks of
seats, and will cut an important factor in
the cheering when any of their respective
men win. The Cycle Board of Trade has
two boxes for its officers and delegates.
The prizes to be given the men are quite
artistic, and are the handiworK of the
Hancock brothers. Jules is the secretary
of the Associated Cycling Clubs, and
Victor represents the membership com
mittee ol the league. The first prizes
will be blue ribbons, printed and tasseled
with gold. The ribbons for second prizes
, will be red, and white will represent third
"money." It is not for their intrinsic
value that the riders want them, there
fore, but for the prestige of winning them
at this particular meet aud before the
immense audience that will attend it.
Charles S. Wells and W. A. ("Bob")
Terrill have just received the prizes won
by them at a Denver meet over a pear ago.
Wells won a $150 diamond and Terrill a
$75 one. The meet was not a financial
success and they did not get their win
nings. The club was- suspended from
sanction privileges by the racing board
, until the prizes were paid. Such is the
protection the'Leagueof American Wheel
. men affords its racing men. The men
: have now received their prizes and the
club will probably be restored to good
standing. -.'77 ; v"V
E. H. Stoddard is making a trip through
some of the northern counties on busi
ness.
The Imperial Cycling Club will hold a
members' meeting next Monday night.
i The billiard tournament at the club is
drawing to a close and a whist tourna
ment is being arranged. The club's fourth
party will take place next Tuesday even
ing at Native Sons Hail. The party will
be a social success and the proceeds there
from will be used to defray the expenses
of building the gymnasium recently
added to the clubhouse. The members
will attend the L. A. W. races at the Velo
drome to-day in large numbers to shout
for their clubmates.
The Bay City Wheelmen will have a
cribbage tournament in the near future â
something which the members have been
wanting for a long time. Already many
a two-handed practice game may be seen
around the clubrooms evenings, and one
hears more about "fifteon-two,*fifteen-four
and one ior hi 3 hat" tnan about bicycling
nowadays.
The Alameda Cyclers bave a little social
function planned for Friday evening, Jan
uary 29, in the form of an entertainment
and musical*. The club is in a prosper
ous* condition.
George E. Dixon, the popular announcer
and tandem cnampion, who has just re
turned from Sacramento, says that the
Capital City Wheelmen there are in a
nourishing condition. Many improve
ments hatVe recently been made in the
clubroooms, and the membership bas in
creased materially. The club will enter a
team in the next relay in April.
The East Oakland .Wheelmen's enter
tainment and dance is set for fiext Friday
evening, January 22. and the cycling cir
cles of . Oakland will he represented on
that occasion. An excellent programme
has been prepared. The affair will be
held at Washington Hall, Sixth avenue
and Twelfth street.
R. M. Thompson, the well-known
dealer of Fresno, and member of the State
racing board is in the City, partly on busi
ness and partly to attend the league meet
at the Velodrome te-day.
C. E. Martling, the Crimson Rim man,
arrived from Loa Angeles Thursday night,
* V
coming here to meet Joseph al. Hill o
the same company, who is on a trip
around the world. Mr. Hill will leave for
Honolulu onthe steamer to-day at 1 p. m.
He is well posted on cycling matters all
over the country, and is of opinion that
the present season will see a revival of the
boom of 1895. Agents everywhere report
large advance orders for 1897, and- with
tho absence of cheap wheels and mush
room factories, or rather assemblers, the
business is in a healthy condition.
Frank W. Fuller of the Olympic Club

committee of the North California Di

noon from the East. Mr. Shafer's plans
are not known, but it is thought he comes
here to take charge of McFarland and

many friends and they will make it seem
like home to him when he gets hereto

THE GUN.
Sportsmen Enjoyed Good Shooting
on Bay Farm Island Years Ago.
Duck shooting " in the marshes that
â¢ margin the 'bay is not as good as the
lovers of the sport would wish, and it Is
extremely doubtful if there will be any
shooting worthy of mention from now
until the close of the season, as the birds
have scattered throughout the country.
From Mount Eden and Alvarado news
has been received that some of the resi
dents of Alvarado have had good sport
during the past week popping spoonbills,
which are tolerably plentiful in the marsh
ponds. :vi*.."i'f; .-'.-.
Duck-shooting in the swamp lands near
San Pablo is said to be very fair, but
owing to the prevailing fine weather the
birds depart for the bay after they are
disturbed in their. feeding grounds. The
morning and evening shooting is very
good. .', '..\ . ..;
Among some of the prominent sports
men who thought nothing of bagging
thirty or forty ducks in a day's shoot on Bay
Farm Island in the seventies were: Jerry
Browell, Bill Clark, Judge Rix, Fred Van
Sicklen, John Stack, Dick- Brooks, Billy
Dugan, Fred Johnson, Ned Edwards, Bob
Lbwenberg, Harry Quinton, Harry Put
tocfc, E. Lynn, Tommy ' Potter, ' Tom
O'Brien, M. Ault, Bill Harrelson, Charles
Cate, Charles Precht, Henry Cohn, Judge
Carroll and o* hers, some of whom are to
day. as passionately fond of the game of
hit or miss as they "were twenty years ago.
But the birds are annually growing
scarce on the marshes within easy reach
of this City because of the large extent of
country in Southern California which has
within the past ten years been made fer
tile by the Irrigating system. In fact "a
large proportion of the wilu ducks which
are shipped to this City during the season
for shooting are killed on the plains of
Southern ' California, where, twenty years
ago, not a bird was seen at any time of
the year. Then, again, it is said that in
Alaska the â  natives' gather thousands ". of
eggs of wild ducks' and geese which are
shipped to England yearly.
The Sportsman's Club ot Portland, Or.,
has appointed a committee to confer with
United States Senator Mitchell with a
view of introducing a bill in Congress to
stop the shipment of the eggs of aquatic
birds out of the country, and it would be
to tbe credit of sportsmen of this State if
the Olympic Gun Club, which is now the
strongest club *of its kind in California,
would appoint a committee : to interview
.Senator Perkins on the matter when he
arrives. â¢ " â : ;â¢..- â " .'
Quail-shooting is said to be first class, as
the birds have forsaken the heavy timber
for the open country, where they can be

found on the sheltered side of the canyons
enjoying their daily sun bath. :
Fred Butler, a prominent sportsman of
the Tamaipais Sportsman's Club, states
that he did not kill 125 birds in one day's
shooting at Point Reyes, and that what he
did bag was only an average mess.
"Yes, with my shooting companion,
Rudolph," said Butler, "our bag for
three days amounted to 109 birds, and not
125 as reported. Last Saturday and Sun
day I grassed eighty-four birds, and could
have killed over 100 if 1 desired, but being
a gentleman sportsman' I thought I would
leave a few birds for -stocking purposes.
You can therefore see that I am not a pot
hunter, as I kill all my birds on the wing,
and the ones I chance to miss are killed
by my companion. There is no such
thingas suffering among the feathered
families we attack either, as we kill our
birds clean and consequently cripples are
scarce in that part of the country."
The following letter is self-explanatory:
San Francisco, Jan. 12, 1897. â 
Sporting Editor: At Bakersfield, Kern County,
commencing next Monday, January 18, will
be held the annual field trials.
The number of entries is unusually large
and as they include many Eastern-bred dogs
the trials will carry much interest. - Quail are
very plentiful and good shooting Is guaran
teed to those desiring the same. The hotel ac
commodations are first class and rates rea
sonable. The Pacific Coast Field Trials Club
invites your presence. * John M. Kilgarif,

John Tarns, a young Sau Franciscan,
who made his mark at Cripple Creek by
discovering and selling mines and thus
amassing a fortune, has returned to this
City and is indulging in his old passion
for duck-shooting. Last Tuesday he went
with his brother and invaded the Suisun
marshes for a couple of days. The genial
John, wfjo is noted for his truthfulness,
as admitted by a jealous brother, bagged
fifty-eight duck, to say nothing of snipe
and small birds.
The clucks were divided as follows:
Canvasback 17, teal 12, widgeon 9, sprig
12, mallard 8. ' The* actual hunting time
was less than eight hours as John got
stuck in the mud, and weighing as he
does 230 pounds, it took his brother and a
gamekeeper two hours, to get him out.
The brother threw a fence board for him
to cling to until the keeper went for a
block and tackle. A rope was then thrown
which the mired hunter made fast under
his arms while a stake was being driven
to make fast to. Tben he was snaked out
like a big redwood log. "Hadn't been for
that I'd killed a hundred," said .John;
"as it was,' I ouly go? forty-shots."
.An Eastern exchange says: Otis Fel
lows, who will soon have a traveling rec
ord to compare favorably with the Wan
dering Jew's, took out to California on this
trip a couple of beagles and a brace of
Irish terriers for John E. Doak of Stock
ton. The beagles are by Champion Royal
Krueger-Hornell Ruby, and the daredevils
are by Champion Crib-Limerick Lass â
breeding tbat is good enough for most
people.
THE RIFLE.
Annual Election of the Nord
Deutscher Verein.
In all probability there will be consider
able lively rifle-shooting at the Shell
Mound rifle range to-morrow. Compa
nies A and F of the Fifth Infantry Regi
ment will hold their monthly medal
shoot. Companies B and Lof the First
Regiment will hold similar contests. The.
Knights of the Red Branch will hold their
monthly class medal contests, and the
San Francisco Schuetzen Verein members
will indulge in rifle practiced
The annual meeting and election of the
Nord Deutscher Verein was held recently
and the following were elected for the
ensuing year: August Meyer, president;
Henry Stelling, vice-president; Chr. C,
Schroeder, secretary; â¢ William Mueller,
financial secretary; Otto i-chinkel, treas
urer; finance committee â Ernest F. Bar
ruth, Henry Miesner and Ludwig Siebe;
doorkeeper, George Stelling.
This organization is one of the most
prosperous in this locality, and its mem
bers are* nearly all enthusiastic, riflemen,
who aro able to hold their own against all
comers. It now has a membership of 400
on the club rolls. Aside from the shoot
ing feature, it is a beneficiary organiza
tion, and in case of sickness it pays its
members $10 a week. When a member
dies the family receives $400. In case the
wife of a member dies, he receives $100.
The regular dues are $1 per month.
The treasurer reported that there is $25,
--000 in the bank to the society's credit,
known as the reserve fund. The interest
of this fund is used for sick benefits and
death benefits. No assessments are made
upon the members unless the reserve fund
in the hands of the treasurer runs down
below $800. In the last year the society
lost fifteen members by death, but no as
sessments were levied upon the others,
and there still remains in the treasurer's
hands, exclusive of ihe reserve fund
stated, $3000. The society was organized
on November 5, 1874.
ROD AND REEL.
Grand Sport Is Now to Be Had in
Russian Riverâ Fine Catches.
If the lovers 'of angling who fancy troll
ing for steelheads desire anything like
sport this winter, they .should journey im
mediately to Russian River, where the
fishing is now about as good as it will be
this year, notwithstanding that the net
fishermen are shipping from Duncans
Mills large numbers of the so-called
salmon to this City.
The railroad is patronized extensively
by the angling fraternity of this. City, still
it will transport fish over its line which
are taken by illegal, means, and the rev
enues derived by the company from such
shipments is not to be compared with the
financial support it receives from anglers
and sportsmen. With few exceptions the
nets used for the capture of steelheads .by
the fishermen who reside in the vicinity
of Duncans Mills are not of legal size, but
the Fish Commissioners say that their
treasury is empty, and consequently they
cannot afford to deputize 'an officer to
make arrests, and thus the matter stands.
The Supervisors of Sonoma County
some time ago , repealed an ordinance
which prohibited the â . capture of . steel
heads at the mouth of the river by means
of nets which stretch from bank to bank,
and as a result few fish can now be seen
in the streams, that empty into the river:
. The netters, it appears, are not satisfied
with the. law as it reads relative to the
size of the meshes of nets that is permis
sible. Latest reports from Duncans Mills
state that the fishes are being caught in
nets the meshes of which are much
smaller than the law allows, yet some
steelheads escape the lines, as' may be
seen by the following, which is a copy of
a letter received yesterday at this office:
Duncans Mills, Jan. 15, 1897. .
Sporting Editor Call: The fishing of the last,
few days nas been very good, and if it does not
rain tome grand sport; will be had while the
river is in its present fine condition. Cross and
Wilson caught five yesterday evening, Crack
nell caught two and several were hooked and
lost. . I have just learned that the boy* are
having great sport this morning near the
mouth of Austin Creek. Butler, Gallagher
and Judge Evans are in the swim to-day. But
ler shipped three fish to the anglers' head
quarters, on Sutter street, to-day. The spoon
is doing the work. Yours truly, ;
I G. W. Morgan. 7
In all probability there will be a rush of
anglers to "the fishing banks" to-day, as
the weather conditions cannot be relied
upon ; the first rain will destroy the sport.-
The Golcher Bros, have received 1 some
beautiful grilse \ rods, and leaders which
anglers who are : desirous of having
the best quality of goods should see. Toe
rods in construction are something simi
lar to the tournament rods. H ; v .-
A few fish were caught during the week
at Point Reyes, but. is- safe to say that
anglers will not have real good sport until
netting at the mouth of the creek is
stopped. 7 â â '.;â  " -. *-' :-â '"-'. '- '-.;',-' â â -;' ':-â 'â¢-- "â¢â

ON GRIDIRON FIELD.
Never-Defeated y. M. C. A. Team
to Meet Undefeated Lick School.
The Y. M. C. A.-Lick School game to
day at Central Park promises to be an ex
citing contest. There is personal enmity
and much rivalry behind the match.
Both teams play creditable football.
Lick has gone through the season with
out once meeting defeat. The school was
not a member of the State Academic Am
ateur League, and consequently the team
did not contest with St. Matthew's School
of San Mateo for the State championship
in the sub-coilegiate class. "â¢ :.-
The little Y.M. C. A. lightweieht team
has an unprecedented record. It has been
organized three years, has played thirty
five games and. has never been defeated.
Its latest creditable showing was against
the University club team, which it defeat
ed in a practice game just before the re
cent society and charity game, in which
the army and navy team outplayed the
big university men. The Y. M. C. A.
eleven weigh on the average 132 pounds,
while the Licit School eleven average
twenty-five pounds heavier to the man.
The greatly superior weight of their op
ponents in to-day's game will compel the
Y. M. C. A. eleven to make particular use
of their trick and team plays. iv. ; : â¢",7~
Game will be called at 3 o'clock.
Syorting Editor Callâ Sib: Last Tuesday the
Examiner - published an account of the game
between the Mill Valley Football Club and the
Themis of San Francisco, which was entirely
erroneous. Among other things it was stated
that the effective work behind tbe line on the
part of the -Mill Valley team won the game.
As It was the passing* was so poor that the
ball rarely left the quarter's hands, and when
it did reach its destination the runner was
generally downed -before he passed -his own
line. The score published by the Examiner
was Mill Valley 16, Themis 4. The cqrrect
score, which can be testified to by C. F. Re
gan, the referee, is Themis 6. Mill Valley 4.
The Themis played a good, clean name.

HUMOR FROM THE
SUPREME BENCH
" '
Pleasantry in an Opinion
.Written by Justice
7 Temple. ;
Attorney Spencer -.-. of Lassen
County Won an Interesting
v Appeal Case. '
Justices McFarland and Henshaw Join
in a Learned Discussion of the
. â >â â  Game of "Frog." .*
It is not often that public attention is
drawn to the rare wit and humor that lie
entombed in that somber" repository
known as the Reports of the California
Supreme Court.. It happened yesterday
that a sample of this heeling spirit of
pleasantry was developed 'â  from one of
those formidable tomes during the pro
ceedings in Judge Slack's court, while an
application to strike out a big cost bill was
on hearing. The court and all the jurors
enjoyed the joke hugely. General W. H.
L. Barnes, who happened to be present,
seemed to be as happy as if listening to or
telling a good story at a Press Club jinks.
John A. Wall objected to the entire cost
bill in the suit of Kennedy and others
against the San Francisco and San Mateo
Construction Company and others. To
support his position he read an affidavit
to the effect that he had given notice of
the motion to strike out, and further that
the proposed cost bill had not been "de
livered" within the five days allowed by
law. -'-.^t. ' - â¢ .
Attorney Anson Hilton, speaking on be
half of the cost bill instead of replying
to Mr. Wail's five-day proposition, made
a counter attack by saying that Mr. Wall's
motion to strike out was not made in the
ten days allowed by law, but that only
notice of such a motion had been filed,
though the actual motion .to strike out
came much later and therefore too late to
help Mr. Wall. _'*-; --':''
Judge Slack said he was willing to hear
argument and as Mr. Wall did not seem
to think that the assault on his proposi
tion was really serious Mr. Hilton said he
would read from a decision made by the
Supreme Court of California, the opinion
being written by the learned Justice Jack
son Temple and concurred? in by the
learned Justices T. B. McFarland and F.
W. Henshaw, the same being reported in
volume 41 of the Pacific Reporter, page
1095.
The original suit was begun by F. V.
Spencer against J. G. Leonard in the Jus
tices' Court at Susanville, Lassen County.
Spencer obtained judgment by default,
and Justice James Branham gave notice
that he would, thirteen days after the
entry of .default, take up a notice of an
application made by. Leonard for the set
ting aside- of. the default. Spencer, on
tbe date of the proposed hearing, applied
to Judge. W. T. Masten of the Superior
Court of Lassen County for a writ of pro
hibition to prevent Justice Branham irom
further considering the case on the ground
tbat be had lost jurisdiction, more than
ten days having expired after the default
was . entered. The Superior Court denied
the writ and Spencer appealed to the Su
preme Cour.t That august tribunal over
ruled both Judge Masten and Justice
Branham and held that ' Spencer was
right. Spencer & Raker and F. C. Spencer
appeared for the appellant, Goodwin &
Goodwin and J. "E. Pardee for the re
spondent., v .*,
Mr. Hilton read from the report of Jus
tice Temple's opinion as follows:
The written notice was handed to the Justice
of the Peace on Monday evening, and the
Justice was told to file it. He was not asked
to act upon it, and the ' counsel for the oppo
site party were not notified of any hearing
and were not present.' Indeed, respondent's
counsel seem to admit that the paper was
handed to the Justice at a time when no action
cou d be expected. Ihey hay that a Justice
courtis wherever' you -find the Justice, aud
that "attorneys, like other human beings, are
not above customs of a country, and it Is
at least awkward, if not downright impolite
ness, to stop the deal in a game of 'frog,' and
distract the attention of the 'swampers' from
.the contest of the 'widow' by injecting into
the proceedings, 'If your Honor please, as
attorney representing the defendant in Doe vs.
Roe, I respectfSUy move,' etc I How much
better to respect the rights of all, and when
the court is sipping the fruits of a well-earned
victory (his own, or some one else's) quietly
band him the paper, with a statement of Its
contents, and a request that it be filed; and if
the 'victories' have not been so frequent but
that he knows what he is asked for, and pro
ceeds thereafter to act upon the request, it
would seem that as much had been accom
plished as could have been by the most format
viva voce motion.
Justice Temple, -after making this quo
tation from the brief on file in the case,
adds : . . *:--"â >*f
Although not able to determine from the
language of the learned counsel what his
Honor was then doing I understand the state
ment as an admission that he. was not then
engaged in judicial work and was probably
not in a condition to do so. At all events no
present action was asked and none coula have
been had in the absence of the opposite party
without notice to him. â¢ \tt-,x^;^T. .;: -.' :''â¢-'
After .disposing of the incidents of the
"frog" game Justice Temple deals with
the legal question in these words:
The question then is, When a motion must
be made upon .notice within a given period
can a party extend bis own time by filing a
written motion within the period and giving
notice of a bearing of the motion after the
time has expired?: To ask the question is to
answer It. â¢ â¢*â¢â 'â  .- -- , â¢â â¢,'â¢â  <".*-."...â . â â  :*
i Applications for relief must be by motion,
and "making and not filing a written ap
plication for such rule or ordsr is not
sufficient. The attention of the court
must be called to it and the court
moved, to grant â â¢- it." People vs. Ah
Sam, 41 Cal., 645. Here, although the* atten
tion of the court : may have been called tc it,
no present action was requested. If the mo
tion had been made, had the court continued
the hearing for argument or for - further evi
dence, it would not have lost jurisdiction, for
in such case. the application would have been
made in time. Judgment and order reversed.
Judge Slack, as was ' his duty, only
laughed at the humorous, comments of
the Supreme Court, and,' after looking
over the papers a moment, remarked that
it did not appear by any of the pleadings
that Mr. Hilton had served his cost bill,
and that Mr. Wall's affidavit ; was not
material because it simply alleged that
the cost bill was not "delivered" in time.
If it was intended to allege that it was
not "served" in time, the word "served"
ought to be used. Since the attorneys
were, insisting on % technicalities it ; was
necessary that the rules -should be en
forced in all their strictness. The lawyers
were given a week to settle their differ
ences or to amend their pleadings accord
ing as they were disposed.
LIQUOR-DE ALER 3/ ORGANIZE,
Protective Association of the State, of

A convention of the retail liquor-dealers
was held yesterday afternoon in Concord
Hall, Alcazar building, at which, a. State
organization was - formed < under ; the i title
of the Protective Association of '-. the State
of California. The meeting was called to

No. 2 of the â¢California . State Protective
Association, In the course of his remarks
Mr. Garland ,-' stated i that ; branch No. 2,
which j was â¢" composed of the retail liquor
dealers of San Francisco, was organized to
meet the exigencies of the recent political
i campaign and protect the interests of the
liquor-dealers. ' Since the election, . the
wholesale liquor men had 'formed ta new
organization, the 5 operation and benefits
of which were confined exclusively to per

by themselves.-. . â  -...â',
"In view of the fact that the Anti-Saloon
League is perfecting and i , * xt l ?^S ! "
organization throughout the -\ State it is
deemed expedient, continued the speaker,
that a permanent protective association of
the retail dealers be formed. J. L. Kaao
vich of Radovich Bros.. was elected chair
man and a temporary secretary was ap
pointed. A comprehensive system of by
laws was adopted and the following
permanent officers were elected: presi

junction with the, wholesale! association
in protecting the interests of the traffic in
malt, vinous and. spirituous liquors.

16 years of age", with a small pistol at 416

it was discharged and the small
bullet made a slight scalp wound on

leg when his balf-brother entered the
room to show him his new revolver, one

proached the owner of the weapon ex
claimed "Now prepare to die," and his
remark was followed by an explosion and
a cry of pain from the injured lad. The
elder brother ran away in fear and Dr.
Caglieri was called. He found that, the
only damage to Devricco's head was a

NO LONGER TO COMMAND
Captain George Chauncey Board
man Has Resigned From .
the Signal Corps.
Retires Because Pressure of Business
Will Not Permit Him to D.vote
Time to the Organization.
George Chauncey Boardman, captain of
the Signal Corps, Second Brigade, N. G. C,
at a meeting of the corps held on Thurs-
Capt. George Chauncey Boardman
day night, astonished the members of his
command by announcing that he had ten
dered his resignation and that it bad been
forwarded to Brigadier-General Warfield.
Captain Boardman, who is general agent
of one of the large insurance companies of
this City, expressed his deep regret to be
forced to take the step he had, but stated
that the nature of his business was such
that it was impossible for him to devote to
the corps the time required, and rather
than neglect his auties as a guardsman be
had concluded to retire and allow some
one who had the time to assume the com
mand of the corps. '
The announcement was a complete sur
prise to the signal men and it. was inti
mated that the fact of the captain
having been married last* October
might possibly have something to do with
the resignation; but that intimation was
silenced when it was announced that Mrs.
Boardman was opposed to his retirement
from the service. â¢ *
Captain Boardman has been connected
with the National Guard since 1885. He
was private of the Cadet Company, Second
Artillery, January 29, 1885; corporal of the
-same, company March 1, 1886, and ser
geantofthe company November 1, 1886.
He was honorably discharged October 20,
1887. On the following day he enlisted as
a private in the Signal Corps of the First
Infantry, and on the Ist of April was
transferred to the Brigade Signal Corps.
May 21, 1889, he was elected sergeant of
the corps, and on the 3d of August he be
came first lieutenant of the Signal Corps
of the Second Brigade. On the retirement
of Captain A. A. Hanks he took command.
Since the organization of the Signal
Corps he has been an enthusiast in the
work, and ever since he has been in com
mand he worked hard and faithfully to
bring it up to its present efficiency. So
high a reputation has this company at
this time that-among National guardsmen
it is known as the "cracker jack company."
There is not a member of the corps but
feels sorry to part with the captain, .who
has won their esteem and highest respect.

A. W. FOSTER HAS
WON HIS FIGHT
Sidney V. Smith Not a Di
rector of the S. F. and
N. P. Railway.
Outcome of the Hot Fight Made
' for the Control of the
Company.
â : _.
Decision' of the Supreme Court Over
turning the Findings of Judge
Angelotti. %
President A. W. Foster of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railway Company
has won his fight in the Supreme Court in
the case of Smith and others against the
company. The court handed down a de
cision of great length yesterday, reversing
the order by Judge Angelotti of Marin
County denying a new trial. The whole
history of the contention made by Sidney
V. Smith and others was gone into. The
court found that the stock held in. the
names. of Sidney V.' Smith, A. W. Foster
and Andrew Markham had- been pooled
for five years; that the stock-pooling
agreement was not unlawful; that the
agreement between the three gentlemen
was susceptible of being used as a proxy,
and that a majority of the three parties to
the agreement could vote all the stock.
The decision was not based upon tech
nicalities in any respect. "The Superior
Court erred," so the decision reads, "in
finding that Gundecker and Wagner were
bona-fide stockholders in the defendant
company, and also in refusing to receive
in evidence the instrument of March 22
and tbe evidence offered by the defendant
in connection therewith for the purpose
of sustaining the averments of their
answer." â¢ Â "7^7
The suit grew out of a struggle for the
control of the road. An election for di
rectors was held at the annual meeting of
the stockholders, February 25, 1896, at
which the question of control was put to
a practical test. At that meeting the votes
offered by Sidney V. Smith, Peter Gun
decKer and G. E. Wagner were rejected.
A. W. Foster and Andrew Markham voted
the 42,000 shares, which had been a part of
the estate of James M. Donahue. The re
sult was that when the votes were counted
Sidney V. Smith was not one of the de
clared directors-elect. Those who were
declared elected were: Antoirre Borel, A.
W. Foster, Andrew Markham, P. N. Lilien
thal, George A. Newhall, James B. Stetson
and John L. Howard. ; -Vv
The votes of Peter Gundecker and G. E.
Wagner were rejected, as well as Sidney
V. Smith's. The reasons assigned were
that- Gundecker aud Wagner were
not bona-fide - stockholders, and that
Smith," by virtue of" his agreement with
Foster and Markham, had pooled the
stocks held in their names on the books
for a period of five years, to be voted as a
unit during that period, and that it wan
cast by Foster and Markham in pursu
ance or that agreement. If the votes thus
cast had be n received Smith would have
been elected a director instead of Liiieu
thai. *
Judge Angelotti found, in the suit
which was brought subsequent' to the
election of directors, to have Smith de
clared a director instead of : Lilienthal,
that both Gundecker and Wagner were
bona-fide stockholders and that their
votes should have been received; also
that the agreement to which Smith was a
party with Foster and Markham did not
preclude Smith voting the stock standing
in his name as he might choose. Judg
ment was therefore rendered by Judge
Angelotti that Lilienthal had not been'
chosen as a director and was not entitled
to exercise the office; also that Smith had
been chosen and was entitled to be recog
nized as a director. -."
A motion for a new trial was made,
which was denied by Judge Angelotti.
The .status ;of the Smith, Wagner and
Gundecker stock was discussed fully by
the Supreme Court yesterday. "We are
very clear,"* so reads the opinion, "that
one in whose name stock has baen regis
tered upon the books of the corporation,
but who has never had any interest in the
stock and is only a dummy for the real
owner, and when the object of such regis
tration was for the admitted purpose of
enabling the real owner to avoid certain
statutory liabilities, whether said purpose
would be effectual or not, is not a bona
'fide stockholder and should not be allowed
to vote at an election."
Concerning the Smith stock the court
found, in addition to the fact that the
agreement'must be held as a proxy, that
the agreement could not be considered
illegal by reason of being in restraint of
trade, nor illegal or against public policy
to separate the voting power of the stock
from its ownership.
Underlying the contest over the election
of directors was the question of consolida
tion with the , North Pacific Coast. To
this the Foster party was opposed.
Criminal* Sentenced by Judge Wallace.
Judge Wallace passed sentences on a lot of
criminals yesterday morning. The penalties
imposed were as iollow3: William H. Brittan,
convicted of manslaughter, to serve ten years
in the State prison at San. Quenttn; Charles

Mrs. YTorthington in San Quentln.
After numerous delays and stays of execu

was sent to the State prison at San Quenttn
yesterday for the purpose of serving . out the
remainder of her sentence.CHINESE BLOOD
AT FEVER HEAT
War Liable to Break Out
Again in Chinatown's
Alleys.
Fierce Quarrels Cause Trouble
Enough in the Kong Chow
Asylum.
The See Yup-Sam Yup Boycott Con
tinues to B; a Disturbing Cause
Here and in Ch'na.
Chinatown is again in an uproar. The
maxims of Confucius have been tossed
into dark, ill-smelling cellars, and the
war god claims the supreme attention of
the Celestial optic nerve.
Tne __ong Chow Asylum fi_ht has
broken out again, this time the strife be
ing augmented by an internal dissension
that ha* resulted in the boycotting of
eight Kong Chow merchants by their own
fellow-members.
News reached Chinatown a few days ago
that the president ol the King Yung Com
pany, who returned to China lately, had
been degraded in office and his property
confiscated, and tbat he was obliged to flee
to the Straits Settlement to avoid death.
The reason assigned for the disaster was
that be had been an active participant in
the See Yup-Sam Yup controversy, which
the Chinese Minister at Washington had
ordered to cease.
Then Lee Poy, a director of the Kong
Chow Asylum, claimed to have received
news that several of his relatives had beeu
thrown into prison and thirty-five of them
attacked for the same reason. Affairs at
once reached fever heat.
Lee Lun Yuen, the president of the
Kong Chow Asylum, at once had posters
placarded over the dead walls of China
town reading as follows:
Our Kong Chow has more men in the See
Yup company than any other body. Our
members are getting Into trouble at home on
account of the boycott against the Sam Yups.
Yang Yu has received orders from the Gover
nor at Canton to breaK up the boycott These
men will be set free and their property re
turned if the boycott is declared oil".
Therefore in the name ol the Kong Chow
Asylum 1 hereby declare the boycott against
the Sam Yups off.
â¢ The posters bore the signatures of Lee
Lun Yuen and about a dozen directors.
Their appearance caused great excitement,
and even as late as last night Officer
Owens bad ail be could do to keep Spoftord
alley clear.
Then various members of t' c Kong
Chow arose in wrath and declared vocifer
ously that this was only another trick of
Ihe local Chinese Consul, and that their
officers had been bought off. They added
to the disturbance by posting other flam
ing placards to the effect that no matter
"what action the officers might take the
boycott was still on.
Ihe names of several stores whose pro
prietors were known to be in favor of
peace were also pasted on the dead walls,
With the request that although members
of the Kong Chow Asylum they should
be boycotted by their own members. The
names of the stores are the Thing Hi, the
Tiunc* John, the Hon Hi, the Lung Sing,
the Gooee Lung, the Hop Wall Lung, the
Fong ; ng Hi and the Mow Hing.
The See Yup Association is composed of
'our bodies, the Kong Asylum, and the
King Yung, the Hop Wah and the Sue
Hing companies. As the latter three
have so far remained quiescent, the peace
movement on the part of the president
and directors of the Kong Chow appears
only to have created internal dissension
in that body.
There are also other wars and rumors of
wars in the Chinese quarter. The Sue
Sing has indulged in a good many threats
of late as regards avenging the murder of
Chew Ging, which occurred a few weeks
ago on Jackson street, and if bullets do
not fly pretty soon it is not due to any
adherence to the ethical part of religion on
the part of the highbinders.
A Chinese named Lee Fook has forthe
last seven or eight days kept himself in
strict seclusion, owing to a few gentle
hint? that it would not be safe for bim to
promenade the streets. This is not on
account of a highbinder feud, but merely
for personal reasons.
About three weeks ago Liv Tung, who
rnns an opium Joint on Duncourt alley,
off Jackson street, between Dupont and
Stockton, was arrested for selling opium
to FooK. The fact that the latter, who^e
business is that of guide, had been seen in
conversation with a police officer a few
hours before the arrest was deemed suffi
cient evidence that he was a stool-pigeon,
and that meant trouble.
Fook's friends warned him that his life
was in danger, and he kept bidden. Last
night he went with the police to Fung's
place, and had it explained to the heathen
in charge â Fung being absent that he
â¢was not responsible for the arrest.
The frightened man also made an earn
est plea in his own behalf. This shows
the fear that pervades the entire Chinese
quarter. Fung's associates were warned
to keep the peace.
Cases of blackmailing are frequent. The
latest is that tried upon a merchant
familiarly known as "Billy Cakes." What
with blackmailing schemes, bitter feuds,
tbe See Yup-Sam Yup boycott and the
latest trouble in the Kong Chow Asylum
things in Chinatown are ripe for a busy
time at the Morgue in the near future.

The New Orphanage to Be Built at Gilroy for the Children of Odd Fellows.
[Reproduced from a drawing by the architect, William Binder.]
PLANS FOR THE
HEW ORPHANAGE
The Heme for Parentless
Children of Odd
Fellows.
It Will Be Built at Gilroy on a
Tract Donated by Mrs.
C. A. Hoxett.
The Building It Has Been Decided to
Erect Will Accommodate One
Hundred Children.
Mrs. C. A. Hoxett of Gilroy, Mrs. M. F.
Thorndike of Stockton, Mrs. Olive Allen
of Santa Rosa, and Mrs. Mary E. Donoho
of the board of trustees of the Orphans'
Home of the Independent Order of Odd
Fellows, appointed by the State assembly
of the Order of Rebekahs of California,
after a number of protracted sessions,
decided yesterday upon a plan for the
home which will be erected in Gilroy.
There is another member of the board,
but she was by reason of illness prevented
from attending the sessions.
Some time ago the parent order erected
a homo for aged Odd Fellows at Ther
malito, Butte County, but it has no ac
commodations for orphan children of
members of the order, so the ladies of the
Order of Kebekahs, which is a branch of
the parent order, thought they would see
what they could do for the little waifs,
and after a long discussion, they deter
mined to start an orpnanage. Many sites
were offeied after the ladies had received
assurance that their work would receive
the support of the membership through
out the jurisdiction, and they were all
carefully examined and the -various ad
vantages claimed for each were fully con
sidered.
At last it was decided to accept a tract of
five acres of land in Gilroy, generously
offered as a free gift by Mrs. C. A. Hoxett.
The citizens of Gilroy became enthusiastic
when they learned of the choice and
through a committee announced their de
termination to contribute $2000 to the
building fund.
Numerous plans for a building were of
fered, and the ladies, assisted by the ad
vice of ex-Judge Davis Louderback, the
board's legal adviser, selected one sub
mitted by Architect William Burill of
San Jose.
The tract donated by Mrs. Hoxett is
within five minutes' walk of the heart of
Gilroy and fronts on Forest lane. The
ground is level, but so situated that the
drainage is satisfactory. The site com
mands gas and water privileges and the
surroundings are admirable.
The building to be erected has a central
or main portion with a wing connected by
short wide hallways; all portions are to
be full stories ana basement. The main
entrance, which will face south, will be
fronted by a large porch with a balcony
over it. On the ground floor will be the
matron's room and parlor; back of these
will be eight bedrooms on the left of the
rotunda, and on the right two large class
rooms so arranged that they can be con

PACIFIC COAST FISH.
Statistical Agent William A. Wilcox
Collecting I acts for Ills Forth
coming "Report.
William A. Wilcox, statistical agent for
the United States Commission of Fish and
Fisheries, is at the Grand Hotel. He has
been on a visit to San Diego and points
along the coast in the interest of the Fish
Commission, and has been collecting ma
terial for his annual report.
Mr. Wilcox's territory extends from San
Diego to Cape Flattery. He collected the
facts for a book of over 300 pages, includ
ing many handsome plates, as a report of
the fisheries of the Pacific Coast for 1895.
What he has been getting for the past
year is supplementary. Mr. Wilcox does
not see anj' large profit in the salmon
| canning business considering the present
j prices. In fact, he says the canners had
j all tbey can do to pay 4 cents for taking
the fish and paying the other expenses.
"I do not see," he continued, "where
there is much money in it. 1 have taken
a good deal of pains to examine into the
salmon business. It has not lately been
productive of much profit.
"The oyster business centering in San
Francisco is one of the most important
branches of the fishing industry in Cali
fornia. San Francisco firms with exten
sive beds of native and Eastern oysters
are the only planters of oysters in this
State. Each fall and spring, as those in
the fishing business are aware, seed oysters
! in carload lots are brought from the At
i lantic coast and planted in the bay. For
several years as many as 100 carloads,
averaging ninety barrels of seed oysters
to the car, have been planted each year.
j Some oysters have also been brought
' from the beds in the State of Washington.
If it were not for this constant planting
of seed oysters the beds would soon be
come exhausted, for the natural propaga
tion does not keep up with the demand."
Ten small sailing vessels are engaged in
bringing the oysters here as they are
needed. Oysters brought from the Atlantic
coast and planted in the Washington beds
retain their flavor, though the Washington
oysters have a strong copper flavor which
they also retain when planted in the Cali
fornia beds.
Special Agent A. B. Alexander, who
has recently been gathering information
on the Columbia River, is with Mr. Wilcox.
He has just returned from the north.

Caledonian Club Gives the
Movement an Unmis
takable Impetus.
A Committee cf Forty Members
and an Appropriation
of $1000.
By Resolution Others Besides Cale
donians Are Permitted to Serve
on the Committee.
The Bums monument movement re
ceived a considerable impetus last night
at the regular meeting of the Caledonian
Club ia Scottish Hall, on Larkin street.
Clansman Y. C. Lawson, who is assist
ant auditor of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s ex
press, offered the following resolution :
Whereas, In view of the fact that the Cale
donian Club of San Francisco is desirous of
honoring the memory and immortal genius of
the poet, Robert Burns, whose works have
been read and enjoyed the world over, by all
nations and by people in every station in life,
and whose memory is dear to every one who
admires all that is Dure and noble and true in
the characters he has depicted so well; there
fore be it
Resolved, That it is the earnest wish of the
Caledonian Club to see a monument erected
in Golden Gate Park, in this City, to the mem
ory of Robert Burns that shall be a credit not
only to the Scottish residents, but to the City
and citizens of San Francisco. Be it further
Resolved, That the Caledonian Club sub
scribe toward the erection of said Burns mon
ument the .entire net - proceeds of its annual
gathering and games each . year until the
monument has been erected, together with
such other donations as the club may deem
advisable.
To this end I herewith submit the following
resolution:
An additional standing committee shall be
established, to be known as the Burns monu
ment committee, such committee to consist of
the chief, the four chieftains, together with
lii teen members of the club, to oe named by'
the chlet not later than the first meeting in

The duty oi this committee shall be to take
entire control of the erection of the proposed
Burns monument and to devise ways and
means to secure sufficient funds lor that pur
pose. They shall. have power to add to their
number not exceeding twenty members, or
non-members, of this club, making the total
number of the committee not to exceed forty
persons. They shall have power to fill any
vacancies which may occur.
This committee shall not be subject to para
graph 1, article 13, of the by-laws, but shall
serve without pay and shall serve until said
monument is erected and unveiled and until
all bills in connection with said monument
shall have been paid, and they shall report at
least quarterly to the club.
They snail have full power to act, but all the
business of this committee shall be transacted
in the name of the Caledonian Club oi San
Francisco.
Any duties which it may be necessary for
this committee to perform, and which are not
herein specified, shall be referred to the club
for action.
The Caledonian Club agrees to pay the cur
rent expanses of this committee until it has
turned over to said committee the net pro
ceeds from the annual gathering and games
to be held on the last Saturday in May, 1897.
The resolution was unanimously adopted
with the exception of that portion of it
which appropriates funds, which, under
tie by-laws, "must lay oyer till the next
meeting.
A resolution was also read appropriating
from the funds of the club $1000 as a con
tribution to the Burns monument fund.
Under the by-laws this also went over to
the next meeting.
FUNERAL OF A SOCIALIST.
An Oration Delivered in the City Cem
etery Over Society's Extremes.
The funeral of Olaf Pearson, aged 43, a
native of Sweden, who died last Monday
at the City and County Hospital, took
place yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock
from the undertaking parlors of H. Suhr
& Co., Mission street, between Eighth and
Ninth.
Out of respect to the deceased's sym
pathy for the socialist cause a funeral
committee of two, consisting of Theodore
Krause of ttie German branch and Theo
dore Lynch of the Liberty branch, at
tended the obsequies, acting as pall
bearers. At the grave Theodore Lynch
took occasion to pay a farewell tribute to
the fidelity of character and devotion to
principle that characterized their dead
comrade.
The poverty of the surroundings, a
lonely grave in the potter's field, after a
life of toil and sickness and suffering, so
overcame the speaker thnt he commenced
to depict in bitter terras the extremes of
society when both have succumbed to
death. The speaker pointed to the gor
geous marble shafts and granite pillars,
whose ornate columns stood guard over
the last abode of the tenants in the ad
joining cemetery, and arraigned in bitter
terms of reproach the social system that
discriminates between those who live in
idleness and luxury and the industrious
poor, whose lives are spent in poverty and
hardship, and whose graves are marked
by obscurity, with rude, rough boards as
silent epitaphs. â â

AFTER THE STRAW
BOND CLERKS
The Grand Jury Looking for
Bonds That Cannot
Be Found.
Experts Expected to Make Some
Very Interesting Revela
tions.
1
The Judge Campbell Inquiry Will Be
Begun on Monday at a Special
Session.
Experts have been put upon the books
of the late Police Court clerks at the in
stance of the new Grand Jury, and revela
tions of the most interesting but not un
expected character are loosed for by that
body.
The straw bond question, which has
been a live one in police circles since the
memory of man can recall, will, it is in
timated, have a fresh illustration in that
of the clerks themselves.
It is said that certain of tbe bonds of
these ex-clerks are missing and not to be
found, so that in case the expert makes
discoveries that would lay the bondsmen
liable, there will be some difficulty in re
covering from them.
William E. Lutz, secretary of the jury
and chairman of the committee on courts,
submitted a partial report yesterday
which dwelt particularly on the straw
bond evil.
Secretary Lutz has proposed in con
junction with District Attorney Barnes a
bill to be presented to the Legislature,
which is calculated to correct this evil to
a certain extent. It provides that the
District Attorney shall appoint the prose
cuting attorneys in the Police Courts and
have a general supervision of their duties;
that the County Clerk shall appoint the
clerks in the several Police Courts and be
responsible for tbeir acts, and that the
Sheriff shall appoint the bailiffs in the
courts and be responsible for their acts.
The session of the Grand Jury yesterday
was very short, an adjournment being
taken to Monday, when a special sessio n
will be beid.
An inquiry will then be begun with re
gard to the allegations to the effect that
Judge Campbell has been addicted to
Jeav'ng his blank certificates of release in
the hands of irresponsible parties about
tbe City.
Benard and O'Brien, the saloon-keepers
who. were most particularly mentioned,
were subpenaed to appear before the jury
yesterday and responded, but they were
not called upon, the matter being post
poned until Monday. *â¢â¢* :

AGAINST SALARY BILLS.
The Iroquois Club Says Time* Are Too
Hard for Such Legislation.
At the meeting of tbe Iroquois Club last
evening Max Popper introduced the fol
lowing resolution:
Whereas, There are now pending in the
Legislature certain bills, the object of which is
to increase the salaries of many officials of
the City and County of San Francisco very
largely over the amounts those officials have
received for many years past ; ana whereas, it
is a matter of common knowledge that lor
some years the business in San Francisco and
throughout the State has steadily diminished,
that wages all occupations have fallen, that
values of property have greatly declined, and
that the burdens of the taxpayer have yearly
become harder to bear; therefore be it
Resolved. That we deem it unfortunate that
the Legislature should at this time consider
any proposition to increase official salaries be
yond tho present amounts which were fixed
when this City and State were more prosper
ous than now, and which amounts have sat
isfied those officials for many years; and be it
further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
mailed by the secretary to every member of
the Legislature and that a committee of five
be appointed from the club to go to Sacra
mento, should it be necessary, and protest
against the passage of these bills.
The resolution was adopted with hearty
cheers.
The following resolution by E. P. E.
Troy was also adopted: "_ ', ".',-'
Whereas, The House of Representatives at
Washington did, January 11, 1897. by a pro
nounced majority reject the infamous Pacific
Railroad funding bill, and whereas California
Representatives (excepting one) proved loyal
to their constituents, and whereas an honest
pres*, public-spirited citizens and a Congress
composed of members who possess the full
realization of their duty to the Nation's honor
sustained the position taken by the opponents
of this nefarious scheme; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the Iroquois Club of San
Francisco, extend our congratulations to Con
gress, our representatives in the Senate and
the House, the press of the land, and particu
larly the Examiner, Call and Report of this
City, and the committee of fifty and the many
other public-spirited citizens who aided in
this great victory; and De it further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
spread upon the minutes of this meeting and
a copy sent to each and every member of Con
gress.
It was decided to have a discussion on
the question of the foreclosure of the
mortgages held by the Government on
the Central Pacific Railroad next Friday
evening. James H. Barry of 'the Star and
Joseph Leggett will be invited to address
the club and its invited friends on that oc
casion.
DEFENDED HER DOG.
Miss Bertelsen and Bx - Policeman
Shields Have a Lively Bow.'
There was a lively and interesting shoot
ing scrape in the far Mission last evening,
in which an ex-policeman and a cow and
a woman and a b'g dog were the promi
nent characters. Ko one was hart, that is
by the bullets, but Miss W. A. Bertelsen,
a tailoress, was locked up upon a charge
of having committed an assault upon ex-
Policeman W. J. Shields with a deadly
weapon.
The woman is 45 years of nge, and she
lives at 2641 Mission street. W. J. Shields
conducts a wood, -coal, hay and grain
business across the street, at 2630 Mission
street.
The woman owns a large Newfoundland
dog, and *ast evening, when Shields was
leading his cow down the street, the dog
ran out, and in a moment man and dog
were in a mix-up.
Then Miss Bertelsen went to the dog's
rescue, and drawing a 22-caliber revolver
fired at Shields. Shields seized the woman
and held her until two policemen arrested
her. t
Miss Bertelsen says Shields threatened
to kill her, and that is why she got a re
volver. Shields was not hurt.

CRUSHED TO THE EARTH.
Caught Under a Heavy Log
and Picked Up for
Dead.
A Veteran of the Mexican War the Vic
tim of a Painful Accident Ãack and
Legs Partially Paralyzed.
From the Tribune, Sioux City, lowa.
Thomas Miller of Adavil'.e, lowa, was re- |
cently interviewed by a Tribune reporter. He i
is a man of 66 years of age and a veteran of
the Mexican war. He is a man of remarkable
vigor, considering his age and the hardships
through which he has passed.
"Mr. Miller," said the reporter, "I under
stand you have used Dr. Williams' Pink Pi.ls
for Pale People and have also recommended
them to your neighbors. Will you tell me
how they have benefited yon?"
"Certainly," replied the veteran. "I shall
be glad to tell you about my case, but in order
that you may understand it fully I will have
to go back about twenty years and give you a
part of mv past history. 1? â¢
"In 1875 I was the victim of a very painful
accident. I was then living in the State of
Michigan, and at the time of which I speaK
one of my neighbors was building a log barn.
I was at the 'raising,' and the structure had
nearly reached completion, and a heavy biack
ash log was bsing hoisted into position. It
was nearly in place when the workmen above
lost their "hold on it. It rolled to the ground
and I was caught under it and crushed to the
earth. They picked me up for dead and car
ried me into the house. I was not dead, how
ever, but I was pretty badly used up. I had
received severe internal injuries and had
several bones broken.
â¢ "In it day or two Inflammation of the bowels
set in, and the doctors gave up all hope of sav
ine me. But have a very strong constitution,
and I think that helped me in a great meas
ure to rally. When I had recovered sufficiently
otherwise to get around 1 found that my back
and legs were partially paralyzed and I could
not walk. I finally got so I could walk with
the aid ot a cane, but I was unable to do any
work, and there was scarcely a moment that
I did not suffer more or less pain in my back
and kidneys.
"I continued in this condition until about
four years ago, when I visited my brother,
Adam Mil. who lives at Reinbeck, Grundy
County, lowa. His wife had been a great suf
ferer from rheumatism and told me she had
been cured by the use of Dr. Williams' Pi >k
Pills for Pale People. I resolved to try them
and accordingly bought a box. Before I had
finished taking them I felt a decided improve
ment, and when I got home to Marcus, where
I then lived, I bought six boxes more. I us? d
them strictly according to directions, and
soon began to feel like a uew man. There was
a peculiar sensation in my buck and limbs
which 1 can best describe by saying that I felt
as if I was being supplied with new nerves
and new muscles. The improvement con
tinued until to-day I think I am ss strong as I
should have been if I. had never met with the.
above-mentioned accident, and I don't think I
exaggerate when I say I can do as good a day's
work every day as any man in Plymouth
Couuty of my age."
"Yes, I still take Pink Pills occasionally,"
said Mr. Miller in reply to a question. "I
wouldn't be without them in the house, and 1
never lose an opportunity to recommend them
to my neighbors. I believe it is due to them
that I am in my present state of health aud
vigor."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are
not a patent medicine in the sense that name
implies. They were first compounded as a
prescription and used as sucn in general prac
tice by an eminent pnysician. ' So great was
their efficacy that it was deemed wise to place
them within the reach of all. They are now
manufactured by the Dr. Williams' Medicine
Company, Schenectady, X. Y.,Â«nd;are sold in
boxes* (never in loose form by the dozen or
hundred, and the public are cautioned against
numerous imitations sold in this chape) at 50
cents a box, or six boxes for .$2 50. and may
be hsd of all druggists or direct by mail from
Dr. Williams' Medicine Company.

rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths, j
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid *

therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The j
word "h;gh" means high barometric pressure and j
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and ls usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. i
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington \
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior i
and low along the coast, and the lsoVars extend |
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low" ls inclosed with Isobars of ,
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and i
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may he expected in summer and colder

NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 15.-The feeling In
stock circles to-day wad more confident than for
some time past, mainly owing to the remarkably
favorable statement of the foreign commerce of
the country for the month of December and the.
calendar year 1896, the steady increase in the'
treasury gold reserve and the superabundance of
money both here and in London. -Three In
fluences have apparently served to stimulate
interest, not only in Investments but also in the
speculative markets. They have Induced the
recognized bulls to take a fresh noid, and at the
same time have frightened the shorts. The latter
made active efforts to cover, and their purchases,
together with a fair demand for foreign account,

'ihe market was strong from the opening to the
close of the session, the dealings having been bel
ter distributed than of late and the advances In
prices having been general. No attention was
1 aid to the Cuban trouble, which for the mo
ment has been relegated to the background. The
upward movement ln Sugar gained additional
force from the announcement of a further advance
in prices of refined and from advices from Wash
ington that If any change is made la ihe tariff on
sugars it will not be detrimental to the interest) of
the sugar refiners. The contest between the
American Sugar Company and the Arbuckle Bros ,
in which there are no signs of a let up, failed to
check the advance.
The commission houses reported more numerous
orders tor stocks) for outside account, although it
Is admitted that the business is still to a large ex

-14,494 shares, and the advance ln prices was
equal to V*Â®'- 1 /* per cent, the latter in Wheeling

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 15.â Opinions were con- !
flicting In the wheat market to-aav. It was con- j
sidered advisable to sell at the opening because
Liverpool failed to properly respond to our 1 cent j
bulge of yesterday, but when % of a ceDt decline j
was established the Government report assumed
prominence as a topic. A good many traders I
bougnl on the presumption that the report wonll
con. aln bul'isb informaion. It was notable that 1
St. Louis bought a great deal of wheat, and as that |
town has been the active raider of ;pilces for ion j
days it was fair to believe that "shorts" were cov
eting.
Receipts In the NOrthwest were 291 cars,
against 178 last Friday and 373 a year ago. Chi- 1
cago had 18 cars and inspected out 181,373 1
bushels. When It was ascertained subsequently
that the Government report would not be Issued
to-day early buyers turned sellers and strength i
gave wry to weakness. Export clearances were |
328.816 bushels. Closing Continental cables i
quoted moderate advances. Liverpool closed %d
higher than It opened. May wheal opened from
80% cto 803/ c, sold between 81c and 79% c, clos- '
ing at 80c bidâ %@**%c under yesterday. Esti- i
mated receipts for to-morrow, 29 cars. No. 2 red I
spot wheat ranged from Bl%c to 89c. closing ;
about 87Â®88c.
CORNâ There was nothing doing in the corn '
market. A few professional scalpers hung around. j
A stray order or two in commission men's bands j
were noticeable. It was difficult to trade, there
being so little interest displayed. Receipts were
301 cars, and 37,357 bushel's were taken from
store. Liverpoo cables were %d lower. Exports !
were 371,062 bushels. May corn opened at 24%,
advanced t0 25, declined and c osed at 24%, 1/4 to J
s/ 8 under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to- J
morrow. 2SO cars.
O .'ISâ As has recently- been the case, more busi
ness was transacted in oats than in corn, but it
was mainly local, and evidenced the professional
sentiment, wbicb was sympathetic with tbat of
wheal. Receipts were 167 cars, and 59,744 bush
els were withdrawn from store. Exports were
1895 bushels. May oats closed 3/ 8 to V* under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow,
228 cars.

opening exhibl.ed a continuation of yesterday's
strength, although business was light. Hows were
firmer, an incident which added to the strength of
provisions. Later packers sold freely and prices
yielded to the pressure. May pork closed 12yÂ«c

Ul'N's REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 15.â P.. G. Dun A Co.
will say ln their weekly review of trade: The
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
greatest growth and prosperity the country - had
ever seen came suddenly "In 1879, after several
months of disappointment- -because - specie re
sumption had not brought the benefits expected.
It takes time for new confidence to reach through
easier money markets, large ciders, resuming
mills, expanding employment and larger dis
tribution to the results which make still greater
and lasting gain possible. Such gradual and
steady improvement has been In progress tor
more than two months. The output of plgiron has
gained 41.6 per cent since October I. The output
of coke has increased 88 7 per cent since October
1. Sales of wool have become large. Money mar
kets feel a steady increasa in demand for com
mercial . and manufacturing loans. Additional
works have gone into operation each week In Jan
uary, and the working force is larger than at any
other time for six months. The gain may be
ascribed to deliberate judgment of the ablest and
most prudent men in business.
Ills not time for high prices. Many who are
anxious to get ear.y hold on the market are mak
ing* for the moment lower prices than they could
afford to maintain. With the increase in the out
put of pit iron to 159,720 tons weekly, against
142,278 last month, the price is a shade lower at
the East and Chicago, but heavy purchases al
ready advance Bessemer steel a shade at Pitts
burg. steÂ»l bars have been reduced lc and
some other finished products $1 per ion, out the
demand on tbe whole is steadily growing. The
coke output has risen from 60,000 to 94,342 tons
weekly and minor metals are a shade stronger.
'textile manufactures are not encouraged
by the demand for good), though more
print cloths were sold than for many
weeks- Lower prices are expected In goods
and slow buying ls not unnatural since cot
ton has fal eu 17.8 per cent from September 11,
print cloths 7 per cent, bleached goods 3% to sy ,
and brown goods 2%, 3(_14 per cent. Though
woolen goods do not improve there have been,
purchases by large mills which cover for two
weeks of January 11.110,300 Bounds at the
three chief markets, against 11,817,600 last year.
Some large purchases of leather indicate that
some shoe manufacturers are seeing their way to
more ac-itve work and shipments from the East In
January thus far are '.0 per cent larger than last
year. Hides at Chicago are 2% per cent lower.
Clearing-house exchanges tor the month thus
far are less than 1 per cent below last year's,
though still 25.2 per cent smaller than tho year
1892," the year of greatest prosperity. Tbe rail
road earnings and tonnage f r January thus far
are light, owing to Western storms, but December
returns cover $38,686,912 on roads in the United
states alone, only 2.3 per cent less than last year.
The Pennsylvania and some other roads have
commenced to buy rails and several costl>* Im
provements have been ordered, the Columbia
bridge alone calling for 70*".) tons or steel and a
terminal improvement lor the trie will cost
Si, 000,000.
Th â¢ wheat market has varied but slightly,
closing %c lower. Western receipts for the week,
1,505,320 bushels, against 2.916,274 last year,
are cheesed by storms and by current prices in
view of the farmers' expectations Atlantic ex
ports were 1,456,408 bushels, flour include.!, and
f r two weens 3,484,317. against 4,483,199 last
year. Traders begin to realize that enormous ex
ports of corn are taking the place of Wheat ln
foreign consumption. Lotion took a rise of au
elgnth on a trader's estimate without change iv
conditions.
The money market has been disturbed by a
com blnallon of large tankers not to lend on call
below 2 per cent, which invited all sorts of finan
cial institutions to lake the market, caused pay
ment of hank loans lor some millions and left
supplies of muds so heavy that time loans were
sharply marked down. More was done In com
mercial paper, though offerings increased but
moderately. Receips from the interior exceeded
shipments by $1,500,001;. Fxports continue io i
exceed last year's for the week 8 per cent, while 1
Imports fell 10 per cent below last year's.
i-ailutes for the week have been 455 in the
United Mates against 395 last year, and 71 in
Canada against 81 Us. year.

Statement by Way of
a Contrast.
He Is Anxious For the.WorJd
to Know That a New Pre
cedent Is Set.
Tbe Largest Item Is : the Amount
Spent by Committeemen on
Election Day. â¢ *
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call.)
;-"â¢â - 'JOS [roadway, Jan. 15. )
Chairman Brosnahan of the Democratic
County Committee has a vein of humor in
his politics. He does not believe that the
oi.i county committee should have too
much notoriety, and. so he has prepared
an interesting document that sets forth
what hie committee has been doing since
the juvenile orator of Nebraska made hia
bow to the country.
While the old committee is: being sued
for its hills ana- the ball of responsibility
is being tossed from one to the other, the
' new committee is congratulating itself
and is making known the fact that it has
paid all its campaign expenses. It was
not Known before that it was necessary
for Democrats, even when in a state of
fusion with the Populism, as was the case
during the last campaign, to make public
the fact that they paid their bills, but
after the unfortunate experience of their
predecessors Air. Brosnahan evidently
thought it advisable to establish a new
precedent.
There are many interesting facts men
tioned in the statement, and the freedom
from debt is certainly a new feeling for
Democratic committeemen. It is true
that the party did not hold its ground in
the county during the last campaign, but
this attribute to the actions of their
predecessors.'
The names of several well-known Dem
ocrats are not on the list of contributors,
but this i- accounted for tv t c fact that
they belonged to the cold party. Among
these are J. J. White, postmaster, J. West
Martin, the banker, and it is also noted
that W. W. Foote does not appear in the
list. Among those who bore the brunt of
the expense are W. J. Dingee, John JHack
ett, R. M. Fitzgerald. J. M. English, T. C.
Coo'gan, Frank Dium and C. Brown.
Warren B. English, Collector ot the Port
at that time, and nis brother, W. D., did
not contribute to the campaign, .and the
list shows, as nothing else could, how
completely broken up were the old party
lines.
The fireworks that were let off jointly by
Populists and Democrats cost $126, while
$234 was paid for bands. All the ex
penses amount to $12 less than the sum
collected. The largest item which ap
pears reads: "Furnished to members of
the County Committee on election day,'
$245." This amount, it has been calculated,
would furnish one "refreshment" to-nearly
every Democratic voter who went to the
polls.
In conclusion Mr. Brosnahan, with a
slight touch of irony, says: "All bills con
tracted by tbe officers of this committee
have been paid and we hold receipts for
the same. 1 wish to thank the members
of the County Committee for their assist
ance and energy displayed during the last
campaign." .
DAVIE WILL RUN.
lie Cannot Say Yet How Hi Will.Ap
pear on the Ticket.
OAKLAX D, Cal., Jan. 15.â Mayor Davie
will be a candidate for Mayor. For some
time Mr. Davie has been very silent re
garding his intentions, but he stated to
day tnat he would certainly be on the
ticket to be voted for in March. '
"Although I intend to be a candidate
for Mayor," said Mr. Davie this morning,
"I cannot say on which party ticket I
shall be or if 1 shall be on any. My name
will come before the voters, but more than
that I cannot say at this time."
Marriage on tlie American Flan.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 15. â Justice
Richmond of Alvarado will perform a
Chinese wedding ceremony to-morrow
evening on the American plan. Hing
Ball, a prosperous young merchant, pro
cured a license to-day to marry Si ling.
The groom called at the County Clerk's
office to-day and as soon us he procured
the license ne asked the Clerk to attach to
it pictures ot himself and bride-elect.
Clerk Ewing obliged Mr. Ball and the
photograph of the youne lady shows her
to oe a very attractive maiden for a Chi
nese.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
COL. IRISH'S DREAM
TO BE REALIZED
West Oakland's Marsh Will
Soon Blossom With
Roses.
â  '. : â¢Yr*"'^
Microbes and Miasmas Must Give
Way to Butterfl.es and
Perfume.
Overland Passengers Will Scon Change
Their Opinions of West
O.kland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broad way, Jan. 15. J
In a few months, for* the first time in
the history of the city, West Oaklanders
will be able to enjoy one breath of pure
air.
For thirty years, according to the oft
repeated remarks of Colonel Irish and
many other residents of that section, all
manner of germs that are bad microbes,
tubercule insects and miasmatic odors
have been waited over the marsh by the
breezes from the bay into the windows
and doors of the residents of that part of
town.
But the end is now in sight. At last
the desired end has been gained, and the
Colonel has probably, been' advised by
telegram in the East by the West Oak
land Improvement Club that the mars_,
is doomed. i'~'-- ;
Nothing has rejoiced the citizens of that
section so much as the knowledge of the
fact that the City Council purchased last
night two blocks of marsh land for the
purpose of a public park. The site of this
park is almost in the middle of the
marsh, and will be 'at once filled in and
planted with trees and flowers that will
make all manner of pleasant perfume.
For thirty/years millions of people
from- all parts of the country have passed
over the overland road across this marsh
on their way to San Francisco, and the
opinion prevails that the horrible, ill
smelling sight is a typical specimen of the
city on this side" of the bay. A few
months ago the railroad company, acting
in unison with the West Oakland Im
provement Club, filled in a small oortion
of land near the Sixteenth-street depot,
and this is being planted for a starter.
An ordinance has recently gone into
effect compelling scavengers to cease
dumping on the marsh, and this is an
other step toward purifying West Oak
land. Now that the land is bought, there
is nothing in tne way of the immediate
progress, of that section. -7.; * ;

NOT LEARNED TO TALK.
Mrs. ' Carmen Schwartz Is the
Most Childish Woman
v . on Record.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call.)
.908 Broadway, Jan. 15. J
. The- most childish woman and mother
that bas come before the courts of this
county is Carmen Peralta Schwartz. Sha
is 26 > ears of age and has one child, but is
so simple that Judge .Greene only per
mitted â¢ her , husband to become her
guardian on . the condition that he would
place her in Borne institution where she
could be educated enough to enable her
to act with discretion.
Mrs. Schwartz is unfortunate enouzb to
be the owner of an estate valued at about
$18,000. When on the witness-stand
Judge Greene could not believe that she
was really unable to answer his simple
questions. She did not know her name if
she. saw it, could not add even the
simplest figures, did not know how old
she was, and, in fact, could tell the
court nothing but that she knew she cared
for her little child.
When her case, was in ; court a few
months ago Judge Greene severely repri
manded her ; husband for not doing any
thing toward improving the. mental con
dition of his wife. .Some of the court's re
marks conveyed more than a hint that
Schwartz might' not be anxious for his
wife to know too much. Since giving the
promise to educate her Schwartz has neg
lected to keep it. A few weeks ago he
appeared in court with a request to draw
money from 1 his wife's estate. Judge
Greene reprimanded him, and stated that
he would entertain a motion tor yoke the
lettors and appoint a new guardian. x To
day Constable C. F. Weldon filed a peti
tion to be. appointed guardian in the place
of Schwartz. ' ' .
. Since his ' marriage Schwartz has got
into trouble by ': the too free use .of . his
knife, and, his trial for assaulting W. H.
Whipple with a deadly, weapon is how
pending. The p tition of Weldon will be
heard next Monday. : ;*
jjbe; husband and wife converse in a
jargon that closely resembles baby prat

court as no one else can understand it.

SHOT HOMING PIGEONS.
Wanton Cruelty That May Cripple a
. ; .' ".*.'., ' Useful Industry.'^',
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 15.â John Mole'
ot the Latham Terrace pigeon loft reports
some wanton cruelty by pothunters which
is likely to compel the abandonment of
the homing races which have been con
ducted by the California H ming Club.
Mr. Mole sent twenty- birds to San
Jose last Tuesday to fly to this city pre
liminary to tho homing race to take place
in connection with the Pacific poultry
show which opens here in a few days. Of
this number only fourgot home, the most
of the others being shot down by pot
hunters. .'* 'tt . ';*..' â¢ . -
One of the best-known pigeons; known
as Cock E 111, flew home and through the
trap into the loft with both legs broken by
shot. The bird was so badly wounded that
it had to be killed. The endurance of the
homer pigeon thus mangled shows its
persistency. This bird was a valuable
thoroughbred Belgian and pigeon fanciers
say it may be necessary to pass a bill pro
viding a penalty for shooting homing
pigeons. ' . â¢,' - ; .
Trustee W. D. Leydecker of Alameda,' an
enthusiastic fancier, loosed thirty birds
recently which he was training for the
Sacramento race and only one of the
number reached home. In the Sacra
mento race of last Monday out of 300
birds set out only twenty-live came
through alive.

largely attended and thoroughly appreci

tor and Messrs. W. J. Hynes, Alex Ros
borough and A. P. Smiley bandied the
tambos, while Messrs. Bob Mitchell,
James Swinnertou and .H. F. Sheldon did
the bones with perfection. The musical
part of the programme opened with a
chorus by the entire company and was
followed by Mr. Hay who sang "Shall
We Ever Be Able to Fly?' Then "That
Melody Divine" was sung by R. 1. Mould.
Mr. Mitchell sang "O Promise Me"; A.
G. Burns, "Dear Old Pard" ; Alec Ros
borough, "My Gal Is a High-born Lady";
C. Jacklin, "We Don't Know How Much
We Love Them Till We Lose Them";
Swinnerton was the ladies' ideal and
made a hit with "C6on Dun Gone"; 8. H.
Henley closed with "Toreador" from
"Carmen."
The flying ballet, a burlesque, . set the
audience wild with , delight. Instead of
the invisible wires and supports, heavy
iron bars and rope were used. The dancer
was suspended by the latter hooked into
a canvas belt two or. three feet wide by
means or a large iron hook. The athletic
part of the programme was pood, and con

TO TELEPHONE
SUBSCRIBERS.
Believing that a knowledge of the man
ner in which switches or calls from one*
eubscriber to another are made by the
young lady operators of the company will
be interesting and of benefit to our sub
scribers,' we. give in this | article, in lan
guage as free from technicalities as such
description will admit, the means and
method by which all calls are made and
answered. * ' ;
We would, first like to say that no tele
phone system ; now exists or will . ever, be
devised which will be either automatic or
free from constantly recurring troubles.
A gas company, a water company or an
elecir c light comyany, after its system is
once installed, has but to pump- supplies
into the mains and its patrons tap off
such quantity as may be desired. Every
telephone subscriber, however, must have
an individual medium of supply in : the
shape of a separate pair of .wires running
from his residence or office on exposed
poles (where they must be protected from
the electric light currents and induction),
thence underground through frequently
miles oi streets^ to the , central or one of
the branch offices. Here they are equipped
.with a number of small devices, ail of
which are essential, and are then termi
nated at the 'switchboard within reach of
the operator. J
Remember further that all this mechan
ism, which is necessarily very line, is con
stantly in motion during the greater part
of the waking hours, and to a limited ex
ten:, all night. This continues 365 days
in 'he year, so it is apparent that ihe wear
and tear upon the lamer part of tne sys
tem, which is common to the use of all
subscribers, is very great, and in spite of
th. utmost care and unremitting atten
tion, interruptions in subscribers' circuits
will sometimes occur. . .'
The telephone statistics of the United
States, which have been carefully kept, in
dicate thai San Francisco has the most
rapid service of any large city, and the
service troubles are less. We make no
comparison with European cities, as but
few of them ma"ke any effort to give quick
connections, and the plants, as a rule, be
ing operated by various governments, lit
tle attention is. paid to complaints. ~7 V
. SWITCHING APPARATUS.
The switchboard, on . which the sub- .
scribers' lines terminate at the central and
branch offices, is a long upright structure
divided into sections of about three feet
wide, each section oeing the end of from
fitly to 150 subscribers, according as the
lines are frequently use 1 or otherwise.
Each pair of lines terminates in a small
shutter (the office of which is to fly up
and expose a number), a minute incan
descent lamp and an orifice into which a
plug can be inserted. ich section is also
provided with a large number of plugs
attached by flexible cords to pairs of wires
running to each section of every other i
switchboard in the City, whether in the
main or branch office. . V. â 
Two young ladies sit at each section
wearing a very light telephone at one ear
and having just in front of their faces a
suspended telephone transmitter, thus
leaving both hands free. â¢''.',
One of, the young ladies answers only
the signals of subscribers who call the
office, with whom she talks direct, and
the other connects to and rings up these
same subscribers when they are called for
by some one else. Each young lady at
tends strictly to her particular duty and
does not interfere with the work of her
associate. (.7 -7'.
METHOD OF SWITCHING.
A subscriber takes bis telephone from
the book and puts it to his ear. Instantly
the miniature lamp attached to his line on
the office switchboard lights and the little
shutter flies up, disclosing his number.
The young lady at once inserts a plug into
bis line and says "Number." Upon re
ceiving the same she immediately con
nects with tho operator having the sub
scriber called for, telling her the number
wanted, and the latter completes the con
nection and rings the subscriber.- bell. .
The act of ringing the subscriber's bell
always lights a small lamp, which con
tinues to burn until the telephone j called
for is taken off the nook; it then goes out.
When a subscriber terminates a tele
phone conversation and hangs' up his
'phone a red lamp lights in the office, and
the young lady pulls out the plug and the
switch is finished without the operator
hearing any of the conversation except
when she comes on the line to ask for the
number. . ; â¢:â-;
All of this is very simple, and if the
calls- were evenly distributed over the
working hours of the day, the young lady
operators would be happy in their calling
and our subscribers would commend our
service without stint, but unfortunately
at times a number of , subscribers, some
times five, sometimes ten, whose lines ter
minate in the same section will have oc
casion to call the office at precisely, the
same instant, and then it is the young
lady, unless she is very experinced and
cool headed, becomes agitated and con
fused, for she knows that the impatient
gentleman whom she answers last, al
though only thirty or forty seconds may
elapse, is apt to tind fault with the delay.
In order to meet this difficulty we have
what is called the overflow switch-board,
and if the calls in a section come in so
rapidly that it is impossible for the girl to
handle them, she simply plugs those' to
which she cannot attend into this over
flow through . lines provided for the pur
pose, and here they spread out among a
number of young ladies who sit all day
waiting for such splashes from the busi
ness waves. After, reading this a sub
scriber will be conscious that his cull is
overfl wed by faf slight delay in the in
quiry for the number and two or three
sharp clicks which 1 precede it. From the
overflow board the process is the same' as
irom the subscribers' sections j just ex
plained..
Now it is a face that ninety out of every
100 calls are received, connected up and
disconnected without any loss ot ; time
whatever; 'the other ten come to us in
times of rush and "are subject to a slight
delay. Furthermore, most of our opera
tors will get a little contused if the rush.es
are long continued, and perhaps make the
wrong connections, neglect the signal to
disconnect, or make an error fin the num
ber. If this occurs frequently wi;h the
same girl we have to dispense with her
services, and it is sometimes pitiful, for it
is usually those that try hardest and have
urgent need. of the positions who are most
troubled in this way. Our ; best operators
leave ? from ' lime . to time j and we have a
class of hew ones constantly in practice,
but a great many never acquire neediul
'coolness and self-reliance. â¢
. It occurs tons that many of our patrons
who may be required to wait for half a
minute will do so more patiently if they
fully understand -the.- cause thereof, and
realize that it is not inattention or neglect
on the part of the operator. It is to ac
complish such purpose that this article is
published.- ..-' â ". â¢ â  f. â¢."â â¢;'';.

HENNESSY LANDED
LITTLE BOB FIRST
â¢
The Chestnut Horse at Odds
of 50 to 1 Outfooted
Lovdal.
Formal Is Quits a Horse After
All, Beating Ferrier in
a Gallop.
Osric II AÂ»ain Finished in Front of
Arrezzo â Ricina Gained a Close
D.clsicn.
One of the most popular of local horse
owners is Bob Davenport. Now Bob is
not just a Chang in stature, nor is he as
diminutive as one of the Rossow midgets
by long odds. Among his worldly poses
sions is a chestnut gelding called Little
Bob, presumably named after the gentle r
man just mentioned. Game as a bulldoz,
this chestnut horse when up on edge has
in the past furnished race-goers a surpri-e
when the game was dull and at a low ebb.
The first race at Oakland yesterday passed
off quietly and then came the second. It
was a mile and'a sixteenth selling affair,
for which Lovdal was an odds on choice.
Little Bob was a starter with Mike Hen
nessy up, and the ring laid 40 and 50 to 1
against him. In a desperate drive "the
Irishman" got the rank outsider over the
plate a heck before tne favorite, which was \
piloted by Charley Thorpe. The time, j
1:48^, marked a most creditable perform
ance.
On a prominent eminence overlooking
the track Bob Davenport, s.anding in a
statuesque position, nervously pulling on
a stubby mustache, viewed the finish. He
did not win a million dollars; neither did
he let his horse run unbacked. Doyle,
Monita and Foremost, prominently men
tioned for first place, brought up in the
ruck.
Opening at odds of 6 to 5 and then re
ceding to two**, Racina disposed of the
twelve other maiden three-year-olds that
lined up in the opening six-l'urJong dash.
Lead in throughout, the filly won in a
hard drive from Modestia, an 8 to 1
chance. The Stock Broker, equally as
well backed as the Winner, was a close
third. Ig_@ Â£Bf*-_P
Osric II and Arrezzo, meeting on nearly
equal terms, fought it out again in the
third event over seven and a half furlongs.
Seven to five was laid against either in the
beti ng. Bernardillo and the two other
starters were quite extensively backed.
The race simmered down to a stretch duel
between the brace of favorites. ' Thorpe's
football tactics were the most effective,
and, running Willie Martin on Arrezzo
nearly into the judges' stand, got the de
cision by a head in 1:85%. Bernardillo'
wa" third, but a heck away.
What a good time Midlo would avo
bad - beating Formal yesterday, sure
enough. Pat Dunne's horse started equal
favorite in- the betting on the mile das i
with F_rrier, and * won in a common gal
lop, stepping off the distance in 1:41%.
Ferrier was hard ridden to down Peter tue
Second a necK.
Old Tim Murphy looked to have fallen
into very easy company in the concluding
race on the card, a six-furlong sprint, and
although going over to the barrier a 3 to 5
chance, finished outside of the money.
Nelson, second choice in the betting, out
footed Roadrunner at the end, beating
that horse a halt, length. Flush Ban, a
500 to 1 shot, was third.
NOTES.
Favorites were successful on three dif
ferent occasion? yesterday.
"Chub" Russell, a California boy, who
made quite a reputation for his saddle
work in the West the past two seasons,
arrived here from Cincinnati yesterday.
Russell piloted the FleiscLman horses last
season. ]>
Abe Shields says He is glad to get back
to California once more and is confident
old Logan will be as big a public favorite
as eve:. Mr. Shields brought along sev
eral other useful bread-winners irom New
Orleans with him. Â£_S__
Ed Purser and his friends were all con
fident 1 that Modestia beat Racina out in
the opening race of the day, notwithstand
ing the fact that the Burns & Waterhouse
filly Racina was Miven the decision. There
was much snarling and gnashing of teeth
over the.result.
Golden, who had the mount on Moreno,
and Shultz, who piloted St. Apollo, were
both set down for indifferent riding.

noon's running events:

How He Lost It.
In the days when 18 Royal street was
one of the most notable gambling- houses
in the country, said an old-timer in the
rotunda of the St. Charles to a New Or
leans Times- Democrat reporter, a fel
low who had lost his right arm in a
frawmiJl two years before was playing
faro in such luck that he had nearly all
the white and red checks out of the rack,
besides having better than half a stack of
blues. Two countrymen were watching
his pay in open-mouthed admiration,
when one made the remark: .' "Â«*c'
"That's a smart man; I wonder how he
lost his rieht arm?" . i" â¢' â¢
"Perhaps it was in the war/
â¢ "I wonder how it was."
"Don't you know bow he lost his right
aim?" said an old gambler who had been
losing and Was in bad humor.
"No."
"Would.you like to?"
"Yes."
"He lost it on the five of tbe deal before
the iast."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
NEW YEAR'S GIFT
TO COMPANY A
League of the Cross Cadets
Presented With Fine â¢
Clubrooms.
The Crack Corp3 Finds Itself
in Elegantly Furnished
Quarters.
But the Name of the. G nerous Donor
Has Been X pt Secretâ Renewal
â¢ of Pledges.
Somebody of remarkable modesty Has
done a handsome thing toward the League
of the Cross Cadets of St. Mary's Cathe
dral parish, but who he is not a boy in
Company A of the cadet corps can learn,
despite all Kind of maneuvering to hnd
his name.
All that the cadets know, and they have
become satisfied with this rather limited
knowledge, is an admirer of the league
presented them with an elegantly
equipped clubhouse and kept himself in
the background.
Company A is made up of Catholic
boys who live in that part of the Western
Addition included in the cathedral parish
and are looked upon by their comrades as
being the representatives of the wealthy
and most prominent families having sons
in the vigorous temperance organization.
Whatever goes on in Company A is soon
Communicated to the other companies of
cadets in San Francisco, and of course the
present of a comfortable clubhouse is now
furnishing talk for members of the League'
of the Cross in all parts of the City. And
the news has spread * among the , boys'
families, with the result that guessing is
mixed with curiosity as to the ide ntity of
the generous donor. --'f-
The clubrooms which the cathedral boys
found ready for them Bt a . moment's
notice are located at 331 Golden Gate
avenue â a central location just a block
from the City Haâ and within a minute's
walk of all parts 01 the parish. The rooms
comprise a cardroom, or rather an amuse
ment-room, pool and billiard room,
library, parlors, office and a gymnasium.
The apartment that appeals to those
cadets with a leaning toward athletic ex
ercises was not fully furnished, but as the
needs of the cadets appear new app'iances
will be added, and so in time the gym
nasium will he quire complete. The other
apartments are handsomely furnished and
carpeted in good taste; in fact, everything
tnat boys- could want for their comfort
and delight has been provided, even to a
sdpply of current literature and a stock of
good books in the library.
The clubrooms were given Company A
# as a New Year's gift, and. a very accept
able one it proved to be; Every evening
sees a gathering of the cadets there, and
they spend the time in amusements that
have a beneficial effect upon character.
As soon as a programme can be arranged
there will be a series of entertainments
calculated to elevate the intellectual and
moral standard, with other events to
matte the club life attractive. The com
pany is in charge of Captain Frank 8.
Drady, First Lieutenant William C. Hop
per and Second Lieutenant Robert G.
Drady. In all there are about 100 cadets
in the company, which was organized in
1894 as the pioneer uniformed corps oi the
Leaeue of the Cross. The Rev. Peter C.
Yorke is the sp ritual director. .-
A movement has been started to have
the other companies unite in the armory
on MarKet street, near Tenth, formerly
occupied by the First N. G. C. Regiment.
Last week the board of officers of (he
league moved into the armory building,
I followed by Company H. If enough com-
I panics take quarters thei.e it is o.lieved
I that the building will be made the City
headquarters of the league generally, as it
now is nominally owing to the occupancy
by the board of officers.
Colonel W. P. Sullivan, Major William
McCarthy and T. R. Curtis have been ap
pointed a committee on renewal of
pledges, to make arrangements for a mass
meeting of the League of the Cross in St.
Mary's Cathedral on the. last Sunday in
February, which immediately precedes
the Lenten season. The officers expect, to
have all the boys from Oakland and San
Francisco in line on this occasion, and
the cadet regiment will be out in full force
under command of Colonel Suiifvan. The
services will be of a religious character,
and his Grace Archbishop Riordan will
deliver an address to the boys and preside
at the administration of pledges. All
members of the league will there and then
make a solemn renewal of their promises
to abstain from liquor. .

HE FOUND GOLD
WITH A PICK
Freight Agent Luce Strikes
a Fortune for the Other
Fellows.
The Randsburg Extension Will
Not Be Built Now by the
Southern Pacific.
A Ledge of Rich Ore Uncovered by
Two Railrocd Officials While
Digging for Fun.
G. W. Luce, assistant ' general freight
agent of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, found a fortune down at Rands
burgthe other day. He jabbed the point
of a pickjinto a ledge ricb with gold. The
only element of sadness about the whole
matter among Mr. Luce's friends is that the
ledge and the fortune belong to others.
Mr. Luce and A. D. Shepard, assistant
freight and passenger.agent of the South
ern Pacific, with headquarters at Los An
geles, made a trip into Randsburg and the
mining section of that vicinity to mate an
investigation into the volume of freight
and passenger business that could be done
by the proposed extension of the railroad
to Randsburg.
In connection with the gold story it also
develops that the extension to Randsburg
will not be built immediately. The result
of the trip of H. L. Huntington and other
officials to the mining section is under
stood to have been tbat while they re
ceived a very favorable impression as to
the mineral resources and possibilities of
the section they prefer to wait till greater
age and permanency has settled in the re
gion before building a railroad there. And
that means that the extension for the
present will not be proceeded with. It is
also thought that the defeat of the fund
ing bill has put a damper in general on
Southern Pacific construction work.
But to return to the story of the Luce
ledge. Two prominent mine-owners,
Messrs. Langdon and Hanson, own a
claim, which adjoins the Kinyon claim
on the south. Considerable work bad
baen done on it in the way of hunting for
a ledge which was supposed to be hidden
somewhere beneath the surface, but with
out success.
Messrs. Langdon and Hanson bad de
cided to abandon the claim, and, in fact,
had already carted away some of the tools
and supplies.
Messrs. Luce and Shepard were up that
way one day with one of the owners of
the claim. Mr. Luce saw a hole in the
ground and a few rusty picks and shovels
lying around. Ordinarily a hole in the
ground possesses no a.tractions for any
body, but in some mysterious and unac
countable manner the assistant general
Ireight agent from San Fiaucisco was
seized with an irresistible desire to dig. j
He threw off bis coat, seized a long-dis
used pick, jumped down into tbe hole and
went to work with an energy that was a
fine example for any section-hand be
tween Portland and Galveston.
"Here, Shepard." said Luce, "get hold
of a shovel and scoop 'er out."
Soon Shepard and Luce were both hard
at work tearing ud the earth and hurling
it aside to the four winds. It is not often
any Southern Pacific official gets entirely
in a hole outsiae of Washington, D. C,
but in this instance these two were in it
with both feet.
They had been at work about fifteen
minutes when chug! went the Lucenian
pick into something awful hard.
"I've struck something," shouted Luce,
'ascertain as the Valley road is no toy
railroad." He resumed work with re
doubled vigor.
Shepard thrÂ»w out th* earth in all direc
tions. A rat terrier working at both ends
wasn't in it with him.
In a few more minutes a fine ledge one
foot in diameter was uncovered. The ore
has been assayed and it runs $S4 84 to the
ten in gold. It was not till they heard of
the result of the assay that Messrs. Luce
and Shepard began to perspire. It was
the beginning f f the vein that they struct,
and as a rule the ledge gets richer further
in.
It was a lucky strike. It is said Lang
don and Hanson are going to give Luce
and Shepard a big ( interest in the claim,
but this bas not been corroborated.
"I picked up that pick and began to dig
just for fun," said Mr. Luce yesterday
afternoon when asked about the story. "I
had no idea of striking anything. I was
astonished at the result and so were the
owners of the mine."
VIOTOEY BATEMAN DENIES.
She Says No 111 Feeling Exists Between

Miss Victory Bateman, with eyebrows
arched and accent expressive of surprise,
takes occasion to deny that any ill feeling
exists between herself and Manager Kyle
on account of her failing health or resig

BUSH STREET WILL BOOM.
Only Waiting for a Supreme Court De
cision to Make Substantial
Progress.
The property-owners and residents on
Bush street, from Kearny west to Van
I Ness avenue, are anxiously waiting to hear
J Irom the Supreme Court in the case which
I will decide the legality of the franchise
under which the Sutter-street Railroad
Company has operated its ghost-car ser
vice for a number of years.
The lower court lound there was no
franchise within the meaning of the law.
From this decision the company took an
| appeal.
A. S. Baldwin, who is the agent for the
Macdonough Estate Company, said yes
terday: "I am not the only one on the
line of this street anxiously waiting a de
! cision from tne Supreme Court. When
I that comes, and just as soon as we know
. that the Sutter-street Railroad Company
| must remove its tracks, a club will be
; formed and the street will be improved.
"There are sufficient public-spirited cit
izens owning properly on its line to make
a move just as soon as ihey find that there
will no longer be a horsecar there.
"The estate which I represent has footed
all the bills and engaged tbe le^al talent
jto test the matter in court. Until the case
' is decided there is no use in forming a
| club, as all we could do would be to patch
I up both sides of the street, leaving the cen
ter in precisely the same condition as it
now is."
Others interested in the improvement of
the street expressed themselves similarly.
I All appreciate the support which The
! Call bas shown for the betterment of the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
MRS. DIMOND WILL
FACE HER HUSBAND
She Denies That She Eloped,
and Returns to Hono
lulu To- Day.
Charles Wilson Hastens to the
Home of His Parents at
Seattle.
The Accused Woman Makes Charges
Against Her Husband, Involv
ing Society People Here.
Mrs. W.W. Dimond, wife of a promi
nent Honolulu merchant, will return to
th 6 little island of Oabu on the Coptic to
day. She will fight her husband's divorce
case, deny all allegations of improper con
duct with Charles D. Wilson, who came to
this City about the time she came, and
will make sensational charges against her
husband.
Charles D. Wilson, whose name has
been coupled in an unenviable way with
that of Mrs. Dimond, alarmed and
MRS. W. W. DIMOND of Honolulu, Who Denies That She
Eloped With Charles D. Wilson.
humiliated over the trouble he ha-i caused
the lady, fled the City last night. He took
the evenine train for Portland and may
go as far as Seattle.
â 'The story of any improper relations
between Mr. Wilson and me is absolutely
false," said Mrs. Dimond with spirit last
night. "It was set afloat by my. husband,
who served me with divorce papers at
midnight the day before I sailed.
"He says I deser led my child, but the
fact is that the Hawaiian law forbids the
removal of a child during the pendency of
divorce proceedings.. My husband served
me with a writ of habeas corpus for the
child at the same time that divorce papers
were served on me, so I bad to abandon
the trip, for wbich I had secured tickets,
or leave the child. 1 did the latter and
now I shall return and give my husband a
battle for my honor."
Mrs. Dimoud was reluctant to speak of
her troubles in detail, but she Anally said :
"My husband is not himself. My body
was covered with black and blue marks
when I sailed and I came here to get fur
ther evidence against him.
"When this case comes to trial the
names of some swell San Francisco
women will come to light as having
alienated a part of Mr. Dimond's affec
tions from me. It is well known that a
half-Hawaiian woman at Honolulu is in
fatuated with Mr. Dimond."
Mrs. Dimond is in a fighting mood, and
she says she intends to face her husband
and force him to prove or retract every
charge he has made.
The following telegram from the lady's
former home lends color to her story in so
far as it concerns her own movements.
The message is from The Call corre
spondent at Cedar Rapids, and is as fol
lows:
CEDAR RAPIDS, lowa, Jan. 15.â When
Major M. A. Hlgley of this city, the father of
Mrs. W. W. Dimond, who is reported to have
eloped trom Honolulu with Charles Dlllard
Wilson, was shown the dispatch, he denied
there had been an elopement. He asserted
that his daughter came to San Francisco upon
the advice of physicians to recover from the
effect of cruel treatment inflicted upon her by
her husband, who has brought suit for divorce
at Honolulu.
Major Hlgley stated that his daughter had
made answer to the bill with countercharges, i
and would leave to-day by the steamer Coptic
for Honolulu to fight the case. She learned of
the scandalous charges as soon as she arrived
at San Francisco, and accused her husband of
instigating them. Major Hlgley declared she
bad traveled alone.
Mr?. Dimond has made a contract to
sing for two years in the United States.
She will return as soon as she is through
with her domestic troubles.
"Mrs. Dimond has a rich soprano witb
a range of two and a half octaves," said
A. J. Moore of the Orpheum last night,
"and when she gets a start there will
never be any trouble about getting en
gagements with eood companies."
Mrs. Dimond gave the following author
ized statement concerning her affairs yes
terday :
I did not elope with Mr. Wilson or anybody
else. Furthermore, my husband knew of my
proposed departure, as is shown by the fact
that he bad divorce papers prepared to serve
on me just as the steamer was about to sail. '
The story that I paid Mr. Wilson's debts is
also as untrue as the charge that I abandoned
my child. Further evidence that I have no in
tention of deserting Honolulu can be found in
the fact that I will return to the islands on the
steamer Coptic to-morrow, as has been my in
tention right along.
The purpose of my visit here was, as my
*^______ â â  â â _____M_M______Bl_____Mâ â -*c.'. ; : -
husband well knows, to secure evidence of his
perfidy, which I have obtained. He knew this
and took advantage of it by suing me for a
divo-ce. â¢
Mr. Dimond and myselt have not lived hap
pily for a long time, a fact due to his neglect
and cruelty to me. Long ago I learned ot his
unfaithfulness and charged him with numer
ous intrigues which he could not deny.
Finally his conduct away from home became
so notorious that we have practically lived
apart since. .
These facts will be fully set forth and their
truth established when my attorneys, Thurs
ton & Stanley, present my side of the case in
court.
My visit to San Francisco was by suggestion
of my lawyers. 1 had learned that a year ago,
when my husband came hither after his fath
er's funeral, he was guilty of serious conduct.
One ol the intrigues in San Francisco of
wnich I have secured evidence concerns two
young women well Known here and my hus
band's brother as well as himself. I have the
dates and places of these occurrences.
But the most serious charges 1 will be able
to prove against him will involve the names
of several women distinguished by their social
connection in Honolulu. -Â**!
With the aid of my lawyers I will also fur
nish evidence to ohowlhat lor two years past
my husband has been consorting with a hula
hula dancer on the island.
In fact, I have been quietly securing this
evidence against him for many months. He
finally learned of it, and has tried to antici
pate my civil suit.
Mrs. Dimond says that she and her hus
band were about to separate nearly three
years ago and concluded to patch up their
differences on account of their child.
Until the husband began to drink to great
excess, she says, she intended to remain
with him, and did not leave him until his
conduct became unbearable.
Before he left for the north yesterday
Mr. Wilson made the most positive denial
of any wrongdoing. He said time would
develop the facta in the case, and until
then he would do nothing further than
nut in a general denial. He did not deny
that he had a deep friendship for Mrs.
Dimond. Those who know the parties
well say he has a d<ep infatuation for the
lauy, which she has not reciprocated, and
that this ha 3 caused the notoriety.
Mr. Wilson's parents live at Seattle.
They also deny the story of the elopement,
as the following telegram shows:
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 15.â Mrs. Wilson, ns
also his parents, Captain and Mrs. William E.
Wilson, say they do not believe there is any
truth whatever in the story sent out from
Honolulu to the effect that Charles Dillard
Wilson and Mis. W. W. Dimond had eloped.
Mrs. Wilson was seen at the home of her
parents-in-law, on Mattery street, where she is
stopping, to-night.
Sue says she left Honolulu owing to ill
health, intending to go to Denver, thinking
the climate of that section might do her good,
where she also expected to be joined by her
brother, Richard E. French, manager of Lin
coln J. Carter's Defaulter Company. Finding
upon her arrival, in San Franc sco that her
brother would not reach Denver for some time,
she decided to come on to this city and visit
upon the invitation of her husband's family.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson some days ago received
a letter written by their son irom Honolulu
during the holidays iv which he stated thai
nfter the first of the year he would return
home, it beii.e his intention to accompany his
wife back to Honolulu after she had recovered
her health.
The statement that her husband had ill
treated her or in anywise caused her to sus
pect . him of unfaithfulness, Mrs. Wilson
characterizes as untrue.
In the letter to his parents Wilson an
nounced that he would return home via one
of the Canadian Pacific steamers, and that be
haa been prevented from making an earlier
departure by the fact that his employers had
requested him to delay the trip until after
New Year's.
For some time Wilson, who was born in this
city, was an accountant in the offices of the
Oregon Improvement Company. He bore a
good reputation here and his family is highly
respected.

Sheriff Whelan in a Quandary as to
What He Shall Now Do With
the Tiny Waif.
A tiny waif of three years trot 3 blithly
about the corridors and rooms of County
Jail No. 3, practically without parents and
without home except for the roof that
now covers her.
The little one is the daughter of Mrs.
Louisa Worthington, woo has twice been
convicted of the murder of Harry Badde
ley, and who began her twenty- live years'
sentence at San Quentin yesterday.
The baby, who bears the name of Ellen
Worthington, was born since Mrs. Worth
ington was incarcerated for the shooting
of htr lover,. and has been with her during
the years she has been under the Sheriff's
charge awaiting or rgoing trial.
Now the mother has been taken away
to pay the penalty of the law and Sheriff
Whelan is in a quandary as to what to do
with the baby. The husband of Mrs.
Worthington is caring for the other two
children that were born to his wife pre
vious to the tragedy and, being in poor
circumstances, it is not thought that he
could support the additional burden of
the third child.
The authorities at the jail have become
very muc i attached to lue little one, who
is said to be exceptionally bright, and are
loth to part with her, but they realize that
the institution is no place for her.
She cannot be cared lor at San Quentin,
and the Sheriff does not wish to place her
in a charitable institution. It is hoped
that some family who will give the baby
a good home will adopt her, so she can
be brought up without the knowledge of
her birth almost in tbe shadow of the
gallows.
Meanwhile she plays about and sings
her baby songs totally unaware of her
mother's terrible fate.
Mrs. Worthington's removal to San
Quentin was accomplished in a very quiet
manner. She haa frequently threatened
suicide, and the Sheriff was fearful that
she would attempt to carry out her design
if she knew that she was to be taken
"across the bay."
No one knew that her time had come
until a deputy Sheriff called yesterday to
tell her to prepare for the journey.
She exhibited little emotion when
parted from the baby, and accompanied
the deputy with all the apathy that has
characterized her actions since her arrest,
three years ago.
THE CREW WOULDN'T WORK
Seven Men on the Schooner Elsie
Refuse to Go to the Japanese
Sealing Grounds.
Last night about 11 o'clock the revenue
cutter Hartley found the sealing schooner
Elsie of Port Townsend drifting in the
calm about the lower bay trying to reach
an anchorage. The cutter made fast and
towed the vessel over near Black Point
where she was moored and the revenue
steamer returned to her wharf.
Captain Fred Currey of the Elsie stated
to the revenue officers last nignt that his
seven sailors had refused duty a few days
ago, and their action forced him to run
for this port. The Elsie sailed with a
crew of twenty-one from Port Townsend
December 20 tor a year's sealing voyage
I in the North Pacific.
The hunting along this coast was un
successful, snd Captain Currey decided to
run over to the Japan sealing grounds,
and last Wednesday, when be headed
west for the Asiatic waters, the seven saiK
ors refused to handle the vessel.
"They not only refused to turn to," said
the captain, "but they .informed me that
they would not work when they got to the
Japanese grounds, and gave no reason for
their action.
"When they shipped in Port Townsend
they were given au advance, which of
course they spent ashore before we sailed.
The day before, they struck they drew
quite liberally clothing from the slopchest
tothe amount of $275. To fit out the
schooner it has cost me over $3000, and
here lam 1000 miles out of my course. I
suppose I will have to get rid of these
fellows and ship a new crew. They are all
old sealers and knew what they were do
ing when they came aboard the Elsie."
The men on being questioned sullenly
refused to answer or make any explana
tion for their mutinous action. Captain
Currey will lay the matter before the Fed
eral authorities to-day. There seems to
be no reason why they should persist in
refusing to work the schooner.
MAY ROGERS' DOWNFALL.
She Is Accused of Stealing Jewelry
From Her Employer's
â ' House.
' The strong hand of the law was laid
heavily upon young May Rogers of 6
Chesley street yesterday afternoon, for
she was placed in the City Prison with a
charge of grand larceny placed opposite
her name on the prison register. About
two weeks ago J. B. Queen, manager of
the California Fig Syrup Company, living
at 436 Buchanan street, wanted a servant
in bis home. Among the applicants was
one more comely and apparently brighter
than the rest. She gave the name of Ruby
Pritchard, and said that she had lived
with her uncle and aunt on Seventh and
Market streets. She obtained the position.
After a few days the family began to
miss a number of small articles. Queen
called upon the Chief of Police and stated
his troubles. Detective Anthony was
started out on the case at once. Before
Anthony reached the house the bird had
flown, and the family found that in* her
last flight she had taken with her a dia
mond bracelet, a pocketbook, a pair of
gloves and several other small articles.
After a long search the detective found
at 314 Green street a girl named Ruby
Pritchard, but she was not the one
wanted. Queen had never seen her before.
However. Miss Ruby had a gijl friend
who had recently been living out, and
who had recently returned to her home
at 6 Chesley street. Her friend's name
was May Rogers. The detective soon had
Miss Rogers in the Chief's office, and
when Queen was called he recognized the
girl at once. The detective went to the
Rogers' house and found some of the
stolen properly, but the diamond bracelet
bad been pawned for $5. , He recovered
the jewel on the pawn ticket. Miss Rogers
was .charged with grand larceny. It is
her first offense so tar as known. Miss
Ruby Pritchard was very indignant that
her friend should have made use of her
name in such a manner.
Fire in a Dwelling.
The alarm from box 49 at 6 o'clock last
evening was for fire caused by a defective
chimney in a frame dwelling occupied, by Mrs.
Alfred Schwartz, 420 Powell street. The
damage amounted to about $25.
