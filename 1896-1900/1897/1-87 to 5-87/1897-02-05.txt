That May Cause the ex-Militiaman
to Be Pub::c'.y Accused
BACRAMENTO, Cm,., Feb. 4.â Colonel
. Thomas F. Barry of Sar. Francisco, ex
militiaman, Democratic politician and at
torney, will be publicly charged with be
ins b. lobbyist for hire, and his exclusion
from the floor of the Senate will probably
be asked for by Senator Bulla to-morrow.
On the same c casion he will pay his
compliments to another lobbyist, who
lirst offered his services to the Los An
geles Senator, and afterward, on the ae
clinationof his proffer, worked against the
measure which he originally proposed to
favor. The name of this gentleman Sena
tor Bulla refuses to ditclose.
The bill about which these peculiar de
velopments cluster is that introduced by
Senator Buila, ana which provides for the
certification of land titles and simplifica
tion of real estate tran?fers.
After the defeat of the measure on Tups

consideration. Yesterday the Senate con

Senator Bulla is of the opinion that the

been influenced by the arguments of those
personally interested in its defeat. In
illustration of his views he related the
followinc; bit of history :
"I know," he said, "that the bill has
been opposed by Colonel Thomas F.
Barry. Yesterday I asked him why he
â¢was working aeainst the bill. He an
swered that tie was here in the interests of
the abstract companies. He further stated
that he was receiving pay for his efforts
directed against the bill. When I called
his attention to the fact that he was vio
lating the law he explained by saying that
he was employed as the paid attorney ol
the abstract companies. I then told him
that he was violating the law by lobbying
on the floor of the Senate and Intimated
that I might have him excluded from the
Benate chamber. His only reply to this
was that this was my privilege.
"All this was freely admitted in the
presence of another Senator. If Colonel
Barry continues his efforts against my
bill I shall feel compelled to call the

in duty bound to protect my bill.
"It nas iurther come to my Knowledge
that the alleged facts of the main argu
ment made on the floor were made by
Colonel Barry, and I know that many
misstatements were contained in the
statement furnished by him."

M'KENNA
IS IN THE
CABINET
California Highly Honored
by President - Elect
McKinley.
THE JURIST NOTIFIED
LAST NIGHT.
As Yet the Position He Will
Occupy Has Not Been
Designated.
HANNA FOR POSTMASTER-GEN
ERAL.
It Is the Accepted Opinion that He
Will Represent Ohio in the
0 ficial Family.
Judge McKenna of the United States
Circuit Court last night authorized tne
statement that he has been invited to ac
cept a position in the Cabinet of Presi
dent-elect McKinley and also that he has
signified bis acceptance. He did not care
to give for publication the dispatch in
which the tender of a position was made,
nor did he wish to make his response
public
He considered these communications
conlidential and personal. He had ex
pected the communication from Canton.
"I can say only this," said Judge Mc-
Kenna last evening, "that no position has
been designated which 1 am to occupy.
That is for Major McKinley to signify.
Beyond this I cannot say."
The definite announcement that the po
sition has been tendered and that Judge
McKenna has accepted the appointment
wal not come a9 a surprise to any one, for
tne fact has been generally forecast, eyer
since Judge McKenna was summoned to
visit Major McKinley.
The peopie will naturally be much
gratified that California has been recog
nized in the make-up of the President's
official lami'y.
Judge McKenna, on his return from
Canton, spoke very plainly to a represen
tative of this paper. "I hay* not been a
candidate for a position in Major McKin
ley's Cabinet," he said, 'and lam not a
candidate." Further than this, he
modestly forbore to speak.
"We were all surprised," said the re
porter, "when we heard that you had so
suddenly gone to Canton."
"Not more surprised than I was to go,"
answered the Judge, quietly.
From this it is made clear that the posi
tion and tue attendant honor which is
naturally conferred by it came ansoueht.
Judge Joseph McKenna was born in
Philadelphia on August 10, 1843. He
came to the coast in 1855 and settled in
Benicia, Solano County. He was educated
partly in the public schools and in the
Benicia Collegiate Institute. He studied
law nnd<r Professor Abbott of that insti
tute and was admitted to the bar in ISUS;
elected District Attorney of Solano
County; re-elected in 1867. As District
Attorney he moved up to the county seat.
After leaving the District Attorney's office
he practiced law.
In 1875 he was elected to the Assembly
of the State of California for the se-sion
of 1875-76. In 1876 he was nominated for
Congress and was beaten, the district
being Democratic. Renominated in 1878
he was defeated again by a narrow ma
jority.
Upon the State being redistricted he
was nominated by the Republicans of the
Third Congressional District, and was
elected in ISB4 to the Forty-ninth Con
gress. He was re-elected successively to
the Fiftieth, Fifty-first and Fifty-second
Congresses. While serving in the Fiity
second Congress he wat appointed by
President Harrison a United States Cir
cuit Judge, and has served in that capa
city to date.
HANNA'S INTENTIONS.
It Is Reported That He May Accept
the Postofflce Portfolio.
CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 4.â The indica
tions are now thai the political intentions
of M. A. Hanna will occupy the Cabinet
guessers the rest of the week. It is re
ported by many of Mr. Hanna's Cleveland
friends who have visited Canton within
the last ihirty-six hours that he may ac
cept the position of Postmaster-General.
Trie more generally accepted opinion is
that Mr. Uanna thinks that he will be
appointed to the Senate by Governor
Bushnell, but the rumor that Governor
JBushnell has decided to appoint Lieuten
ant-Governor Jones to the Senate in suc
cession to John Sherman, March 4, is not
thought to be wholly reliable.
An earnest effort on the part of local
Republicans attached to both wings of the
party in this fctate is being made to main
tain the harmonious relations whicu have
existed in the State for the last year and
a half, and it is by no means certain that
Governor Bushnell may not at the last
moment appoint Mr. Hanna to tne Sen
ate, though up to this time he has in no
way indicated his willingness to do so.
Whether Mr. Hanna is appointed to the
Senate to till Sherman's unexpired term
or not, he will be a candidate lor the Sen
ate at the regular fall term of the Legisla
ture which is to be elected next fall and
which meets to choose a United States
Senator in January next.
Many of Mr. Hanna's friends want him
to go into the Cabinet, and Major McKin
ley has desired it ever since his election.
The bel'ef is that Mr. Hanna will be
here at 1 o'clock to-morrow and will spend
the night, and it is more than likely that
he will come to some detinue conclusion
respecting the Cabinet, although he awaits
the efforts of those who are trying to
arrange matters in the interest of party
peace, though he may not announce his
decision for two or three weeKs.
The visit of General Alger to Canton to
day was not fraught with importance.
He came to present the wishes of some
Michigan friends, and there was a little
talk about an Assistant Secretary of War,
but nothing of a definite nature respect
ing this important appointment was done.
The visit of Chairman Gowdy of the In
diana Republican Committee was one of
interest. He spent the day in Canton and
hÂ»a an extended talk with the President
elect. Mr. Gowdy says Indiana wi!l be
modest in her demands upon the Presi
dent-elect, and when pressed confessed
that he would like to be appointed
Consul-General at Paris. As a matter of
fact, applications for office from Indiana
have not been as numerous in Canton as
from many other States.
There are at least twenty applicants for
the post of Consul-General at Pans.
The appointment and acceptance some
time last night of J. Addicks Porter to the
position of private secretary to the Presi
dent-elect puts a stop to further discus
sion on that subject.
Perry S. Heath of Indiana, who was a
good deal talked of in connection with the
office of private secretary, came here to
day in response to a telegraphic message
from the President-elect. Mr. Heath was
offered and accepted an appointment.
The position to which he has been as
signed, however, has not been given out.
Mr. McKinley said to-night: "I have re-

SOME NEWS
FROM THE
OLIVEBANK
Butler Was Known on
Board Her as Robert
Ashe.
HE WANTED A SEAMAN'S
BERTH.
Captain Petrie Easily Identified
a Picture of the Cap
tive.
BUTLER HOLDS A LEVEE IN HIS
C7LL.
Denies Tbat He Was Interviewed, or
That Hi Maie a Confession or
That He Insulted Ladies,
The third day of Butler's incarceration
has passed and still he is self-possessed,
non-committal and apparently indifferent
to the awful charges of many murders
that have been placed against him.
He emphatically denied yesterday that
he had made any confession, and repudi
ated the facts, sentiments and unnatu
rally graceful language attributed to him
by the Examiner in its inaccurate and
boastful article.
He was at his own reaueat furnished by
the Australian detectives with a suit of
new store clothes, which he donned early
in the afternoon to be more presentable
to his numerous visitors, many of whom
were women.
The police estimate that fully 3000 per
sons have thus far called to see the human
monster. No restrictions have been im
posed. Every one is admitted to the corri
dor. The Chief or Police gave orders to
admit any respectable looking person.
Some of these visitors hover near the
bars in close proximity to Butler. Some
of tnem give him cigars. Most of them
talk to him. To all oi them he appears
uniformly courteous and stands up nearly
ali day on parade for the satisfaction of
the morbidly curious and the sentimental.
Butler's property has all been placed in
safe keeping, and not even his attorneys
can see it until the extradition proceed
ings commence.
KNOWN AS RICHARD ASHE.
Butler Served Under That Name
Aboard the Olivebank Four
Years Ago.
"That is Richard Ashe, a native of Ire
land, who served aboard my ship as an
A. B. in 1898," said Captain Petrie cf the
British ship Olivebank last night when
shown a picture of Lee Weiler, or Frank
Butler, the man now in the City Prison
accused of at least a dozen murders.
The Oiivebank has been outside for
some days, and on several occasions she
was reported as the Swanhilda, both be
ing four-masted bark-ricked ships. When
the news came that Butler had made a
voyage on the Olivebank, there was a rush
to board the ship and secure Captain
Petrie's statement. After identifying the
picture he said :
"I shipped Richard Ashe in Rio da2
Janeiro, in April, 1893. He told me that
he held a certificate of competency, and
only chipped before the mast because he
wanted to get out of the place. He was a
good seaman, and truthfully, I can only
remember of one occasion on which he
gave trouble. He was laid up with the
rheumatism, as well as I can remember,
and was on the sick list when we reached
port. I sent for the doctor, and that gen
tleman said he was not so sick but that
he could work. I went into the forecastle
with the second mate with the lotion the
doctor had left, but Ashe got into a vio
lent rage and refused to allow me to apply
the medicine.
"H â¢ also remarked that he bad it in for
the captain of the Star of Russia, and that
he would make both of us suffer before hÂ«
was through with the matter. When we
reached our dock Ashe was arrested, and
just before <he Olivebank sailed I paid
him off in jail, giving him 30 shillings
that was coming to him, and I tbink his
receipt is now on board.
'Last trip, or Jast December rather,
when wÂ« were in Newcastle, I ran across
Ashe; or, as you call him, Butler, again.
He was well dressed and prosperous, and
xvhen he accosted me on the street I
stopped and spoke to him. In answer to
my Questions he said he had come from
Sydney to ship as mate of a vessel, and he
expected to get away in a few days. He
went about openly in Newcastle, and
seemed to hare plenty of friends. Dur
ing the voyage he mads on my ship as a
sailor he dil not impress roe as a bad
man, nor did he show any sign of insub
ordination until we were within a few
days of port. He was a uood sailor, and
did his work well. He seemed fairly well
educated, and appeared to me *.o be above
the rank of an ab e seaman."
Arthur Partridge, one of the apprentice
boys on the Olivebank. was on the sbip
for his first voyage when Butler joined
her at Rio de Janeiro. He at once
recognized the picture of the supposed
murderer, and said that when he Joined
the sbip Ashe said he had been second
mate of the Scottish Giens.
"The men in the forecastle did not like
him," said Partridge, "because he had
such high and mighty ways. Once he
refused to scrub the boat on the main
hatch because be thought it would make
him look undignified. H; had to do his
work, however, and he vowed to get even
with some one."
Captain Petrie and Apprentice Part
ridge will probably be called upon to-day
by the police to identify "Lee WeJier" as
the man who, in 1893, passed himself off
as Richard Ashe, second mate of the Scot
tish Giens.
BUTLER'S LEVEE IN JAIL.
Ho Is Besieged by Visitors Who
Bring Him All There Is Nice
to Eat.
Butler, Lee Weller or any other name
by which do may be called, is very sore at
the treatment he has received at the hands
of the Examiner. He did not fail to tell
this to every visitor wto called on him
yesterday, and they were many.
According to his story the Examiner
has maliciously traduced him with an
idea of aggrandizing itself as an enterpris
ing and successful paper, regardless of
accuracy, truth or common-sense, and
with a venomous idea of prejudicing his
case. But bis own statement, signed be
fore witnesses, as he in his cell deplored
the condition of affairs, tells the tale bet
ter than could columns of comment in
the premises. It is p jblished iii these col
umns.
There is no doubtfng that Butler is
uroving a great attraction at the City
Prison.
Turnkey Shaw stated yesterday that the
Australian prisoner came third on the list
as star lodgers. Durrant attracted ihe
greater number oi cranks and Winthrop
came next.
As a matter of fact, the way Butler's
levees are being attended, it is likely that
he will eventually gain a notch or two be
fore the detectives will have him in hand
on the way to Australia.
The hawkshaws from the Antipodes
have been besieged by acquaintances, and
even strangers, for permission to look at
the prisoner, and ihe following letter has
been forwarded to them as a business pro
posal:
San Fhancjsco, Feb. 4, 1897.
To the Australian Vetectives: I will donate
to you or any Australian charitable institution
the sum of one thousand dollars ($1000) for
the services of Lee Weller (Butler) as an ex
hibit for the period of oue week. The object
is lo exhibit him to the public for pity.
Thomas H. Shaw.
Shaw stated frankly when asked about
his proposal thai he would, if permitted,
exhibit Weller as & business proposition,
as he saw "enough cranks around this
City to pay him a handsome profit for the
privilege of seeing the murderer."
Detective Roche of Australia brought
around a tailor to measure Butler for a
suit of clothes.
"We have taken all his wearing apparel
from him as evidence," said Roche, "and
we must furnish him with clothing in its
Btead."
Late yesterday afternoon the clothes
came and the prisoner donned them ail
except the coal. He feels more comfort
able in his sbirt sleeves.
A. B. Doming, a religious patent medi
cine man, called on Butler during the
morning. He pleadea with him to fast
during a few days, to as to purge his mind
and body of all sin. He advised that the
prisoner should then feast in good shape
and he furnished him with substantial
stuff enough to do it.
There were three jars of Dickies, three
pounds of cheese, one bag of crackers, one
bag of nuts, four pounds of dried figs, two
dozen bananas, a score of apples and
oranges, as well as numerous other bun
dles, including a pipe ana much tobacco.
Aside from the cranks that called on
Butler there were some people who were
Honest in their endeavor to see the man.
Among them were Captain Kustel of the
ship Hawaiian Isles. The captain sailed
from Australia * few days before the
Swanhilda.
Butler, it appears, asked toe captain for
a berth aboard his ship as mate. Captain
Kuscel refused to take him as a mate had
already been signed.
When the two men met in the prison
they knew each other at a glance.
"Hello 1" exclaimed the captain, ex
tending his hand between the bars of the
cell.
'"How are you, captain?" inquired But
ler, gra3pmg the skipper's proffered fist.
The two men conversed for a few mo
meats on every topic excepting the one
uppermost in cither's mindâ that of the
murders.
Others who called and who recognized
Butler's as a familiar face, but who could
not positively identify him, were John
Dowling, Owen Bradley, Edward Daly
and Michael Glenn of the La Grande
Laundry, where Butler Worked about four
years ago. Butler knew them, however,
better than they knew him, and especially
in the talk with Glenn he recalled small
incidents of days gone by that made the
crowd search back in their memories and
finally decide that they mn-t have been
acquainted at some time with the priioner.
A Letter From Weller.
LONDON, Eva., Feb. 4.â A letter from
Lee Weller, one of tbe victims of Frank
Butler, now under arrest in San Francisco,
has been received by Solicitor Donaldson.
It is daiea November 26, 1896, and informs
a lawyer that the witer is going pros
pecting. A part of the letter is written
in a hand- writing different from Weller'*.
Donaldson is of the opinion that this is
Butler's handiwork.
Solicitor Donaldson, who is the execu
tor of Waller's will, says the latter left
very little property.
AS USUAL, A FAKE.
The " Examiner Â»s" Interview With Butler Denied and
Condemned.
The Examiner is evidently suffering from an acute attack of silliness. It printed
a faked interview with Butler, the alleged murderer, Wednesday morning and called
attention to the feat yesterday in the following idiotic utterance:
mi. AND kxclusith.
" The Examiner" Had the Only Statement From Butler.
The only newspaper In the United States which contained a statement yesterday from
Frank Butler, under arrest lor murders committed in Australia, was the Examiner. So,
likewise, the only paper which contained the prisoner's admissions that he had passed as
Richard Ashe, and that the name Lee Weller was not his true name, was the Examiner. All
this was most important news, and without it the story of the capture and the conclusion of
this extraordinary man hunt was not complete. The statement made by Butler was of the
utmost importance because It outlines the general scope of his defense.
It was not to be expected that a man under charge of murder would disclose the whole
truth, but there are part* of Butler's story supported by corroborative proofs, and more
particularly those relating to his life in California, that have absorbing local interest.
That the Examiner was enabled to publish this statement is a source of pride, especially as
other papers working in the same field were defeated in getting at the pith oi the story.
The Examiner was not the first paper that said Butler had been known as Asbe.
The Callâ and probably the other papers of the Cityâ gave that "most important
news" long ago, and referred to it again on the day after the capture. The Australian
papers that arrived in this City about the middle of January had the same important
"news."
As to the interview with Butler, the prisoner made the following statement, which
â peaks for itself, yesterday afternoon:
CITY PRISON, Feb. 4, 1897.
To the Editor of the Call : In this morning's Examiner an article is published pur
porting to be an interview with me in regard to my affairs, my past life, aliases,
alleged residence in this City and the particular cases on account of which I am in
detention. 1 desire to repudiate the alleged interview, as it is entirely false. 1
granted no interview of the kind to the Examiner representatives, or any other per
son or persons. The story, therefore, is an absolute lie, calculated to misinform and
mislead the public and do me great injury.
Why the Examiner should so falsely represent me by publishing such an inter
view, which I did not give, I do not know, but I feel that it is a most despicable and
cowardly action against a man who is in peril and has no means of defending himself.
Again, I repeat that the Examiner interview is as false as it is malicious.
The Evening Post contained the following denial:
CIIY PRISON', San Francisco, Feb. 4. 1897.
The statements which have appeared in the morning papers, and in which It is implied
that I have stated certain facts, containing my past history, are pure and simple fabrications.
I have not as yet made any statement as to my life, ana will not do so until T am authorized
to do so by my attorneys. When lam ready to make such a statement It will appear over my
own signature. This will probably occur after the preliminary trial. Ido not tnke this course
from a desire to conceal anything that tne public should know, but I cannot afford to risk any
chances on my case. The statement that I have beeti rude and insulting to vUltors is bdso
lutely false. I have been uniformly courteous. lam glad to see strangers, and they need have
no fear as lo a cordial acknowledgment of their visits.
Newsiaper men may speculate in their columns and editors endsavor to make the public
believe that they have my confidence, but it counts for nothing. When I am ready to talk I
will atiest the genuineness of the interview by attaching my signature to the same. Â»
i Lee Weller.
Mr. Weller wrote these fe* lines in my presence and I attest their eenuineness.
H. S. Robinson, Captain of Police.
Hearing that Bntler had declined to become an accomplice in its fake interview of
yesterday morning, the Examiner had its men around him all last evening. They
apologized for having published that he insulted ladies who came to visit him, and
offered to make it all right if he would stand In. After an hour and a half the re
porters departed with something bearing Butler's signature.
To a Call reporter, later on, the prisoner said he had signed a statement to the
effect that the Examiner's story was all right. He had heen told, he said, that the
reporter who wrote the fake would lose hi? place, and as ha has not been here long
enough to know that what the Examiner wants i 3 fake-writers he believed the story
and signed the statement. He sxid, however, that he did it only becanse he did not
want to get any one into trouble, and in consideration that the Examiner should
correct the impression it had spread that he insulted ladies and on condition that the
paper would apologize. He said, too, that his statement to The Call, obtained witn
ont misrepresentation or fraud, was absolutely correct, despite what he signed for
the Examiner.
Captain Robinson was present when Butler signed the Examiner's ready-made
justification, and he, Butler says, joined in the request to help the reporter out of
trouble, and witnessed ihe signature, as he had done before.
LEGISLATION FOfi
SAN FRANCISCO
f Continued from Hrit race. J
ing of the City cemeteries should be left to
a vote of the people of the City.
Ex-Supervisor Burling declared the
agitation to bo incited by the San Mateo
cemetery associations who, he said, were
interested in the closing of the City ceme
teries so as to increase their own revenues.
By a unanimous vote the committee de
cided to recommend that the bill do not
pass.
William Clayton, the secretary of the
San Francisco and San Mateo Electric
Railway Company, appeared before the
joint committee in opposition to the
Braunhart bill for 2J^-cent fares on street
railways at certain hours of the morning
and evening.
He stated that the receipts of the com
pany for the year 1896 averaged $533 22 per
day and that one-third of tbis amount
was collected between the hours pre
scribed in the bill for making the reduced
rate. This would mean a loss of $78 74 a
day to the company. * The areument
mode that a reduction in rates would in
crease the traffic he pronounced to be
fallacious. He said the population of San
Francisco was not great enough to supply
tbis expected increased traffic. Many who
now ride at other hours, he said, would
take advantage of the prescribed half
rate hours, and thus the revenue of the
company would be still further dimin
ished. He asserted that no man of re
sponsibility would take the road as a gift
if this bill were passed.
Many other roads, he believed, would
have to be abandoned, as it would be
profitable to operate roads only on the
most-traveled streets, such as Market
street and Kearny street. Wages of street
car employes, he assure t the committee,
would certainly be the first to suffer if
any decrease occurred in the revenue of
the company.
Referring to the Toronto street railways,
which it has been stated were operated at
great profit under a reduced rate system,
he said the regular car employes there
were paid but 16 2-3 cents per hour, while
extra men received but 15 cents. In San
Francisco all car employes received 22
cents per hour. He also stated that rail
road supplies cost less there than here.
In conclusion he said the passage of the
bill wouid mean tbe practical confiscation
of the property of the roaa, and that the
company would have to retire from busi
ness. It looked to him, he remarked, as
if this legislation was in the interest of the
great Market-street Railway Company, as
it would force the little roads to fall into
the hands of that corporation.
George A. Newhall of tbe Presidio and
Ferries Railway declared that bis com
pany had $500,000 inverted in the road
and that it had earned no dividends for
the past six years. Last year ti.e com
pany lost $25,000 and daring the last five
years the company had lost 90,000 passen
gers annually owing to the traffic Having
beed diverted to other new competing
lines. He entered Into figures and showed
that the company would suffer a net loss
of $64 per day if the reduced rates were

put into operation. He ended by declar
ing his company, too, would have to go
out of business.
At this Mayor Phelan was announced
as being present, and was asked to ad
dress the joint meeting on all measures
before the Legislature relative to San
Francisco. He declared that there was no
need of additional Superior Judges in San
Francisco, but was in favor of increasing
the salaries of such Judges from $4000 a
year to $Â«000. He explained that his
opinion on the latter proposition was
simply that of an individual.
So far as the Police and Fire depart
ments are concerned he saw no reason for
a general increase. He thought, however,
that the Chief of the Fire Department
should be given a salary equal to that of
the Chief of Police, which is $4000. The
Fire Chief is now getting but $3000. Dis
trict engineers of the Fire Department, he
believed, might also justly have their
salaries increased from $150 to $175, and
the secretary of the Fire Commissioners,
he suggested, ought to have his compensa
tion increased from $150 to $200 per month.
There was no urgent necessity, however,
he remarked, for increasing salaries in the
Police Department. The chief aim of this
measure, he declared, was to raise the
salaries of certain police officials, ndtably
that of Chief Crowiey. so as to permit him
to retiie on a good pension. Speacing of
pensions, he suggested that men at 60
years were still hale and vigorous in San
Francisco, and he thought the retirement
age should be extended to 65 years.
On the matter of low streetcar fares, he
thought that so far as the Market-street
system is concerned it would be no hard
ship to them to reduce the rates between
the hours named in the Braunhart bill. If
tbis perverse corporation, as he termed it,
would only learn from the experience of
other cities it would make such reductions.
'Many people," he said, "have been
driven away from San Francisco because
they could not afford to live in the
suburbs, as carfare was too high." A re
duction in rate* on the Market-street sys
tem, he declared, would tend to increase
the population of San Francisco. So far
as the Presidio and Ferries road is con
cerned he thought it would have to give
up the ghoÂ«t for the benefit of the woric
intrman. He expressed the came views
relative to the San Mateo Electric Rail
way. .
He favored the clo&ing of all the City
cemeteries, as they thwarted the growth
of San Francisco westward, the building
of a $75,000 fireboat and the election at
large of the Board of Equalization.
He was strongly opposed to the propo
sition of taking a census of the cities of
the State. He saw no use for such a pro
ceeding as it appeared to nim, so far as
San Francisco is concerned, to bo a cover
simply for creating desirable places.
No words were spared in denouncing
the present police judiciary, wbicn he
said did not require any additional court.
It was siciply inefficient, not inadequate,
he said. Cri me now went largely unpun
ished, and no one was ever imprisoned
where a fine could be imposed.
The committee was informed that Gar
ret McEnerney was preparing a constitu
tional amendment providing for the re
daction of the number of precincts in San
Francisco, so as to diminish the expense
of holding elections there. The immedi
ate object of this, he exnlained, was to
hold special elections for Freeholder! and
for a new charter.
||Senator Bulia of Los Angeles has a bill
pending providing that one street railway
shall not usa the tracks of another for
more than five blocks. Senator Bulla was
captured as he entered the chamber at
this point ana asked to explain to the
Mayor the object of his bill. He did so by
stating that it was to protect a certain
railway property in Los Angele* from
competition. The Mayor asked to have a
conference with the southern gentleman
and the latter agreed to the suggestion.
The offices of the County Clerk, Re
corder, License Collector. Sheriff and
other county departments were criticized
for alleged extravagance. He said there
was a tendency in hard times to create
places for friends who were thrown out of
employment.
Applause greeted the conclusion of the
Mayor's address. He stated that he would
remain here to-morrow, and would be
pleased to consult with the authors of
measures relating to San FrancWco.
Assemblyman Treacy called the Mayor's
attention to his bill, "preventing the de
pletion of the pension fund of the Police
Department by promoting officials just
previous to their retirement." His bill,
he declared, would save as much to the
city as would be required to increase the
salaries proposed in another measure con
sidered by the Mayor, his reference being
to Wolfe's bill.
Wolfe took the floor in behalf of his bill
and paid high tributes to the Chief of
Police and nis subordinates.
Assemblyman Dibble, speaking in refer
ence to the liulla bill previously referred
to, said the greatest evil California was
suffering from was the prohibition in the
constitution against special legislation.
He thought the words of the constitution
should be exactly reversed so as to pro
hibit the enactment of general laws when
special laws would answer.
He informed the members of the joint
committee that a constitutional amend-
ment was now in the Assembly providing
for the passage of special laws for special
interests and special instances by a two
thirds vote of the Legislature, subject to
the absolute veto of the Govornor. Such
provisions, he declared, would prevent
undesirable and harmful combinations.
Supervisor James Brut of San Francisco
expressed himself in favor of increases in
the salaries of the Chief of Police, the
captains and detectives, the fireboat and
reduced car fares.
1 Assemblyman Dibble asked the Mayor
to explain why he should object to the in
crease of salaries of certain San Francisco
officials when the charter which he sup
ported during the last election provided
for such increase.
Mayor Phelan answered by stating that
times had chanced, crops had failed and
other things baa occured to make such an
increase undesirable at this time. Inci
dentally he made reference to his election
being due to the Democratic voters.
This brousht Wolfe to his feet in a short,
eloqnent and impassioned speech. He de
clared that at the time of the election a
question of religion, which was a violation
of the spirit of the constitution, bad en
tered into the campaign. He asserted that
the Mayor owed his election not to his
advocacy of the new charter, but to the
vote of the fair-minded and broad-minded
men of all denominations and all political
parties, who were determined not to per
mit any religious question to enter into
the politics of San Francisco. Senator
Wolfe's remarks called forth hearty ap
plause.
A. K. Stevens, representing the Sutter
street Railway, appeared in opposition to
the 2'2-L-ent fare. He argued that the
aciionof the Legislature should be based
on facts and not on sentiment and theo
ries. The Sutter-street Railway, he said,
had a large capital invested and had
tended to develop the western portion of
San Francisco. This books of the com
pany, be said further, showed that for
the last eight years the large capital
locked up in the enterprise bad paid only
5 per cent a year, ana that for the nine
years prior it did not pay a cent.
C. L. Ackerman argued that the 2}4
--cent bill was a contemplated injustice to
a!i the smaller street railways, and that
the measure was one inspired by revenge
ful and vindictive spirit against the Mar
ket-itreet Railway.
He declared that Mayor Fhelan did not
have a dollar invested in street railroads,
because he was too shrewd a financier to
put his money into Â«-uch enterprises, as
he knew the profits were not what mc-t
people believed. He pleaded for fair con
sideration and a chance to be properly
heard as to all the facts and figures.
Senator Braunbart, the author of the
bill uuder discussion, declared he would
not consent to such a hearing as Mr.
Ackerman suggested, as that idea, he
thought, was suggested simply to buffet
the bill about from pillar to post. He
asserted that the Legislature had before
regulated carfares by statute and could do
so again if it saw fit.
Mr. Center, representing the San Fran
cisco Association of Improvement Clubs,
spoke against any increase in salaries of
San Francisco officials.
County Clerk Curry opened Â»,is remarks
by complimenting the Sheriff and the Po
lice and Fire departments of San Fran
cisco. He said that his predecessor had
neglected to collect over $100,000 in fees,
and the Mayor, whose duty it was to look
after the matter, could come into his of
fice at any time and ascertain where the
delinquents are. He added that it was
true he had employed more men than his
predecessors, but as a resnlt be had turned
Into the treasury $22,000 last year after
paying all the expenses of bin office,
which was more than self-sustaining. He
was willing at any time, he said, to have
his office investigated by the Superior
Judges of San Francisco or by the Demo
cratic Judges alone. He ended by speak
ing in favor of the adoption of a new char
ter two years i ence.
Senator Wolfe moved that the bill pro
viding for increases in the salaries of cer
tain police officials in San Francisco be
reported back with the recommendation
dv the Senate committee that it pass.
The motion was adopted. It was also de
cided to report the free-market bill favor
ably to the Senate, and at ten minutes
past 12 the committee adjourned.

TARIFF SCHEDULE
NEARLY FRAMED
Important Change Excludes
Importation of Mexican
Cattle.
California Fruit and Wine In
terests Will Be Fully
Considered.
Members of the Ways and Means
Coirmiitee Feel Gratfi-d at
the Progress M^de.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â The
work of framing the new tariff law has
been well advanced by the Republican
members of the Ways and Means Commit
tee and the United Associated Presses is
to-day enabled to report progressAvith the
leading schedules. The last of the formal
hearings of interested parties was given on
January 11, so that only a little more than
tnree weeks has passed. The chemical
schedule, which comes first on the list,
the glass schedule, the metal schedule and
the cotton schedule have all been put in
tentative form with some controverted
questions still open, and the agricultural
schedule was nearly concluded to-day.
The wine and spirit schedules in the Mc-
Kinley bill have been adopted without the
change of a line.
The most important change Is on live
cattle, which is covered by a blanket pro
vision of the existing law for all live ani
mals at 20 per cent ad valorem. The rate
under the new law will be $5 per head on
cattle more than a year old and 25 per
cent ad valorem on cattle valued above
$20. This is thought to establish a more
equitable rate than the McKinley law,
which imposed $10 per head on all cattle
more than a year old without regard to
value, and is regarded as sufficiently pro
tective against the importation of Mexi
can cattle.
The rate on barley is the McKinley rate
of 30 cents per bashel, which was de
manded by the American barley-growers.
Hay is put at $4 per ton, the same as in
the McKinley law, and hop 3at 15 cents per
pound, which is also an extract from the
McKinley law.
Vegetables all go back to the McKinley
rates, potatoes being put at 25 cents per
bushel, and flaxseed at 30 cents per bushel.
Other items upon which McKinley rates
are restored are salt at 12 cents per 100
pounds in packages, and 8 cents when in
bulk, starch 2 cents per pound, salt meat
extras 3 5 cents per pound, milk 5 cents per
gallon and poultry 20 per cent. â 
Eggs go back to 5 cents per dozen and
berries to the old McKinley rate.
Oranges and lemons will be adjusted in
a manner to meet the wishes of the Cali
fornia fruit-growers. The rates have not
yet been absolutely fixed, but will involve
a different classification from thai of the
McKinley law.
Under the chemical schodule, soap made
of caustic soda and kindred chemicals re
mains at the rate fixed in the Wilson law,
which is considered sufficiently pro
tective.
TnÂ« principal oils are left at existing
rates, except in the case of linseed and
flaxseed oil, where an advance was re
quired because of the restoration of the
McKinley duties on raw materials.
Refined borax is advanced from 2 cents
to 3 cents per pound, which is somewhat
under the McK'nley rate. Boracic acid
remains at 30 cents per pound, the rate
fixed by the existing law, while borate of
lime is increased to 2 cents per pound.
There are only slight cnanges in dye
stuffs and their elements. Lead, in ores,
is fixed at 1 cent per pound, pig lead at 2
cents and white lead and lead acetate at
2'^ per cent These rates arc considerably
less than those of the McKinley law.
Castor oil is left at 35 cents per gallon, the
rate fixed under existing laws. The cot
ton schedule has not yet been quite com
pleted, but there will be few chances, ex
cept on the fine yarns and costly fabrics.
The schedule was satisfactory in its con
struction to many of the manufacturers
when it was put in its present form and
they are asking only minor changes.
Wine* and spirits will be made satisfac
tory, if possible, to the California grape
growers and manufacturers, hut, as indi
cated, this can be accoraplisned by the
restoration of the McKiniey rates.
The iron and steel schedule, like cot
tons, was left in a fairly satisfactory con
dition to the manufacturers by the present
law, and they will not be changed except
upon a few special articles like tin plate
and cotton ties, and some of the makes of
tube steel. There may be some more
changes in surgical instruments and tools,
but the advances will not be large.
The duty on steel rails has not been
fixed, and the committee will endeavor to
obtain some further data before adopt
ing It.
The earthenware schedule taalso incom
plete but will be put upon a firm protec
tive basis.
The rates on decorated china were pat
exceptionally low in the present law, be
cause of irritation between the manufac
turers and their employes. The new
rates will be specific so far as practicable,
and plate glass will be subjected to ad
vances. G!a?s above 24 by 30 inches,
and not exceeding 24 by 60 inches, will
be left at the present rate of 22}Â£ cents a
square foot. The next bieher size will
also remain at the present rate of 35 cnts
per foot. The smaller sizes of plate glass
are advanced from sto 8 cents per foot
when not exceeding 16 by 24 inches and
from 8 to 12 cents per foot when not ex
ceeding 24 by 30 inches square.
The committee have talked over a few
other schedules, but have not yet reached
definite results. They are awaiting the
mestinc of wool prowers and manufac
turer* week after next before deciding on
the rates for these articles.
A rate of 8 cents per pound upon all
classes of wool has been suggested as a
probable compromise on the raw product.
The progress made indicates that they
will have the bill well in hand before
March 4.
Leading members to-day express great
satisfaction at the progress already made,
which covers nearly half of tne printed
test of the schedule.

FREE SILVER FUSIONISTS.
The Long-Expected Address at Last Issued
to the Public Proposing Radical
Financial Reforms.
DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 4â The free
silver fusionists of lowa issued their prom
ised address to the people of the State
to-day.
It is signed by the nine members of a
committee appointed at a conference here
in December of the Democrats, Populists
and Silver Republicans of the State. The
address is very long and temperate in
tone. It recommends that the alliance of
the three parties be coniinu-d on the
same ba-iu as effected in vhe late cam
paign; that separate organizations be
maintained, but that all conventions, State,
National and district, be held at the same
place and at the same time, and that the
same candidates be named by ail.
The address then proceeds with a long
discussion of the political and financial
situation. It regards the results of the
recent election as a vicioryfor shyer, in
spite of the result in the electoral colleges,
and declares that there can be no perma
nent return of prosperity to the country
under the gold standard.
The fact that McKinley's election has
not brought a return of prosperity is
pointed to as an evidence that it will not
ultimately produce better times.

tion whom he has to consider, and that
population can only be conquered by war,
which would cost Russia as dearly as in

"FALSE AND FOOLISH
OBJECTION TO RUM"
Senate May Exclude Liquor
From the National
Capitol.
Id justice of the Shutting Out of
an Immigrant's Igno
rant Wife.
The Fourth Day of Vila's Speech in
Opposition to the Nicaragua
Canal Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4âAs soon
as the routine morning business was dis
posed of in the Senate to-day the House
bill was taken up to prohibit the sale of
intoxicating liquors in the Capitol. It had
been reported by Morrill (R.) of Vermont
from the Committee on Public Buildings
and Ground-, and he desired its passage
while declaring it was unnecessary and
was based on a misapprehension in the
public mind.
Sherman (R. ) of Ohio took a Bimilar pry
sition. Even though it was based on false
and foolish grounds he thought the Sen
ate ougnt to meet the popular objection
and pass the bill.
Hill (D.) of New York took a different
view of the duty of the subject. He de
nounced the bill as silly, unwise and un
necessary, as a weak yielding to an alleged
public sentiment which regarded murder,
robbery and burglary as minor crimes in
comparison with a disregard of prohibition
laws, and as vicious and cowardly. He
moved its reference to the Committee on
Rules, whose jurisdiction extends specifi
cally to ail that concerns the Senate res
taurant, but that motion was defeatedâ
ay es 27, noes 30.
At the close of the morning hour the
bill went ovrr without aciion. It will
probably be taken . up for action to
morrow.
The next question was the conference
report oa the immigration bill. The dis
cussion on this was short, as Lodge (R.) of
Massachusetts, having charge of It, recog
nized the justice of the objections made 10
it by Hill and other Senators in re
gard to shutting out the ignorant wife of
an immigrant, while the husband might
pass the reading and writing test. Lodge,
himself, made the motion that the con
ference report be disagreed to and a new
conference ordered, and that motion was
agreed to without objection. While it was
pending Carter (R.) of Montana remon
strated against the provision intended to
exclude Canadian workmen, as it would
juÃtiiy the Dominion of Canada in
adopting drastic measures against the
10.000 American miners who found con
stant work and good wages in the Koote
nai country in British Columbia.
The Nicaragua canal bill was taken up,
and the remainder of the day's session
was occupied by Vilas in opposition to it,
this being the fourth day of his speech.
He argued that the duty of the United
States in the matter of the canal is to have
a survey made and a complete plan pre
pared, and then to confer with Great
Bn tain, Germany and France as to thecon
struction and maintenance of the work.
He had not finished his speech when the
Senate adjourned.
Proceeding* in the House-
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4. â Con
sideration of the bill making appropria
tions for the expenses ot the District o!
Columbia for the year ending June 30,
1898, engaged the attention of the House
to-day to the exclusion of almost all other
business, and at adjournment it was still
the unfinished business.
The further conference asked by the
Senate upon the immigration bill was
agreed to and conferees were appointed.
Among the few bills passed in thecourM
of the day were the following: Granting
rieht of way through the Gila River Res
ervation in Arizona to the Hudson Reser
voir and Canal Company. Granting a
pension of $50 a month to the widows of
General J. B. Carr and General John

for the Colonies, was signed by the Qaeen
.Recent to-day. The document covers sev
eral pages of the official gazette, and addi
tional detail? of its provisions, which were
obtaine i by a rrrre>-!ita:ive of the United
Associated Fre-se?, show the following
provisions of the scheme:
One of the principal features of the plan
is the creation of a Cuban assembly, which
will be known as t c Council of Adminis-
iration. This body will be composed of
thirty-five members, of which twenty-one
will be elected by popular vote and s>ix by
the ieadine municipal and provincial cor
poration?. The remaining eight members
will consist of a leading magistrate, a uni
versity professor, an arch-episcopal dele
gate and n>e ex-Senators or Deputies. All
measures desired by municipal and pro
vincial councils, which may be disap
proved the governor-general, can oe ap
pealed to by the Administrative Council,
and finaliy referred to the colonial minis
ter at Madrid.
The municipal and provincial councils
will nominate the municipal Judges and
the Council of Administration will frame
the budget and draw up a customs tariff
under the proviso that a protective mar
gin of 40 per cent at least shall be allowed
to Spanish goods against foreign goods.
The customs officials must be Cubans.
The Governor-General of the island is
Â«mpowered to appoint the high officials,
but they must be Cubans or Spaniards
who have r<-sidpd on the island ior two
years. These officials include the magis
trates and prefects. The municipal coun
cils-general will elect their own Pre-i
--dents and control the administration of
education.
The Government reserves full power to
maintain public order and may adopt
measures even against these reforms
whenever such measures may be needed
to supress rebellious movements.
The Government will reguiate the tariff
until a Cuban tariff is decided upon.
As previously announced, the Cuban
representation in the Senate and Cham-
ber of Deputies will remain as heretofore.
The publication of the plan has made a
."bad impression in Spain, as the scheme is
generally regarded as giving everything
to ibe Cubans.
The scheme provides that Spanish prod
ucts entering Cuba shall be granted a
rebate of 40 cer cent as compared with the
duties imposed on foreign products.

A Cuban Say Jheif Can Conquer Spain
and finvern ' /iem<Â« lvet.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 4.-Senor
Tomas Estrada Palma, the Cuban dele
gate, when interviewed to-day concerning
the proposed reforms in Caba, gave out
4he following statement :
"Had genuine autonomy instead of
sham reforms been offered to the people
of Cuba before they rose in arms, the
Cubans would surely have accepted it,
and, therefore, bloodshed and total devas
tation of the island would have been
â¢verted.
"If the Cuban people did not accept
these sham reforms then, and rose in arms
for independence, how would they accept
them now and enter into any kind of com
promise which has not for its basis the
nbsolute independence of the island?
They are sure of success, and one thine is
ceriaiDâ that is that the Cubans never
again will place their necks under the
Spanish yoke.
"They have proved so far that they are
able to conquer the Spaniards and eovern
themselves."
This was .all that the Senor had to say
with regard to the Spanish promises of
reform, but other members of the Junta
talked more freely.
"Spain," said one of them, "will never
grant to Cuba the autonomy that England
gives to Canada. Instead of real auton
omy Spain desires to get Cuba again in
its power by granting it reforms winch
are virtually meaningless. In fact,
Cubans generally do not believe that
Spain is capable of being just, and we do
not beJieve that Senor Canovas and
Colonial Minister Castellanos can formu
late or devise any reform without preju
dice or bias.
Were Cuba now to accept autonomy
from Spain it would be a virtual surrender
on the i art of the Cubans. A treaty be
tween Spain and Cuba must have lor its
basis the absolute independence of the
island of Cuba."
SPA.SIARHS ABUSE A GIRL.
A. Cultured Toting L a d y BanlÃhed for
Sympathy With Cub ins.
TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 4.â Among the ar
rivals on the Olivette this morning was
Clemencia Arango, a sister ol Colonel
Arango of tae iusureents in Cuba. She is
the daughtei of the late Dr. Araneo, the
" noted physician of Havana, and a young
lady of rare culture and intelligence. Her
, brother being an officer in tne Cuban
â army, she was naturally thought to be a
sympathizer with the cause of liberty and
information on which to base an edict
banishing her from the island. A few
day* ago she and two others, who are in
Key West, received the following notice
from the Government:
Under the reserved seal of the Police De
partment of the city of Havana, bearing date

Mrs. Kose Cigerra, Miss C'lemeucia Arango
and MHs Emilia Cordoba, that, ou account of
their action iv favor of the Cuban cau'-e, they
are deetued connected with the insurrection,
end all the more dangerous because they are
women.
The captain-general, on agreement with the
proposition of the civil Government, haa de
creed with to-day'a date that time women
shall be banished from this island, and they
are hereby prohibited from returning until an
express edict shall be issued permitting them
to do bo. They are ordered to leave within
three days, commencing on the day they were
notified, together with the intelligence that if
they should not abandon the island at ihe end
of the time stated they shall be imprisoned as

on December 8 last as a political suspect,
took place to-day, and resulted in his ac

There was no evidence produced at the
trial to prove that he was connected in
any way with the rebellion.

saved from being overthrown in the
Chamber of Deputies to-day.
On Tuesday, during the debate on the

were secured to defeat it, but only by an
extremely narrow margin. The vote in

He Shed Tears of Joy at
His Enthusiastic
Reception.
May Bring an Action for Indem

England.
Claims That the British Polici Manu
factured the Evidence to Be Used
to Convict Him.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Feb. 4.â The cen
tral figure among the cabin passengers on
board the steamship Majestic, which ar
rived from Liverpool to-day, was Edward
J. Ivory, alias E Iward Bell, wno was re
cently released from jail in London by
the British authorities after their charges
of alleged conspiracy to injure life and
property Dy dynamite had bÂ°en aban
doned by t tie prosecution.
Ivory was accompanied by John F. Mc-
Intyre, former Assistant Di-itrict Attorney
of New York County, and three witnesses
who went lrom here to testify in Ivory's
behalf.
Tie Majestic was sighted off Fire Island
at 10 o'clock this morning and arrived at
Quarantine about noon. Ihe large ocean
steamer was met at Quarantine by the
steamer Laura M. Starin with a reception
committee on board, composed of mem
bers of the Irish National Alliance and
prominent Irishmen from all parts of the
country, and friends and sympathizers
ready to welcome Ivory back to America
and freedom.
As the Majestic slackened her speed
Ivory and his counsel, John F. Mclntyre,
stood upon the upper deck and waved
their hats and handkerchiefs to the crowd.
They were transferred to the Laura M.
Starin, but before leaving the Majestic
Ivory indignantly denied the report that
he had received Â£10,000 from the British
Government, nor had he received 5 cent 3
28 indemnity for his incarceration. He
said he certainly would not go on a lectur
ing tour through the country, but tnat he
intended to liva in his home in Harlem
just as quietly as he had done Defore he
went aoroad.
Mr. Mclntyre said he had been very
cordially ana courteously received by
counsel on the other side upon his arrival
in London, and had been accorded full
charge of the defense in Ivory's case. He
declined to discuss the case in detail just
then. The Ivory party was most heartily
received on board the steamer Laura M.
Starin, which at once proceeded to the
city, where the party was landed.
After Ivory, Mclntyre and the three
witnesses were transferred to the Starin
they were immediately surrounded.
Ivory's friends embraced him, and the
reception drew tears from his eyes.
As soon as comparative quiet was re
stored President Lyman of the Irish
National Alliance bade Ivory welcome
back to New York. He said the entire
powerful machinery of the English Gov
ernment had b*en brought into play to
convict Ivory. Mr. Lyman complimented
Mr. Mclntyre on the part he had played
in defending Ivory. "If England ever
again attempts to convict an innocent
Irishman," be said, ''the must reckon s c
has to deal with a combination on this
side of the Atlantic who will defend his
intfreits to the las:.' 1
When Mr. Lyman had concluded there
were loua cries for Ivory. Mr. Ivory in
response to the demands for a speech
bowed his acknowledgments. He waÂ»
about to speak when Charles O'Connor
McLaughlin, secretary of the Irish Nation
al Alliance, delivered his address of wel
come to him, Mr. Mclntyre and the three
witne?ses. Ivory tnen made a brief reply.
"I must say," oe said, "thatever since I
was able I did all I could to advance the
cause of Irish freedom and nationality.
There is nothing, however. I ever did for
Ireland I am sorry for, and tnere is noth
ing I ever did that could raise the blush
of shame to my cheek "
Mr. Ivory ai*o spoke enthusiastically
of Mr. Mclntyre's efforts in his behalf.
This was the signal for another outburst
ot cheers for Mclntyre, wno made a short
address in response. He *aid that the
lawyers who had been engaged to defend
Ivory had advised him to plead guilty.
"They told him," he said, "that there
was no hope of an acauittal, and that there
was evidence of an incriminating character
whi. h would send him to a felon's tomb.
i lelt that justice must prevail. I saw
Ivory, talked with him and told him not
to plead guilty, for I saw no evidence
which would justify conviction. Ivory's
immediate response to me was: 'I will not
plead guilty, and I never intended to do
so.' "
Mr. Mclntyre then went on to tell of
the trial. He declared the proceedings
showed tba" Scotland Yard manufactured
the evidence for the purpose of sending
Ivory to prison. "1 say that the testi
mony against Ivory was manufactured,"
cried Mr. Mclntyre, ''upon my character
and aÂ« an American citizen, by Inspector
Melville and the crowd of Scotland Yard
for the purpose of procuring an indictment
against Ivory.
"Ivory, it is true, was accorded justice,
bui it was done under pressure. I want
to say now that the reason Ivory was ac
quitted of the charge was because fee was
an American citizen, and because they
knew the United States Government was
willing to back him up in the event of in
justice being done him. Ivory is here.
He has come back, and in a free man once
more. It is the duty, however, of Ameri
cans to stand tty Irishmen when they are
in difficulty. Ivory does not deny that he
is a Fenian, or that he wants to see Ire
land free once uiore."
At this juncture there were loud cheers
for Ivory, Mclntyre and the witnesses.
Ivory took a clipping from his pocket and
hande i it to Mr. Mclntyre, whispering
something to him. "Mr. Ivory," Mr. Mc
lntyre said, "has asked me to d?ny a
statement published in one of the news
papers thai he received $50,000 from the
English Government as an indemnity for
his arrest."
There was great cheering as Mr. Mcln
tyre concluded his address.
Father Murphy of Boston then made an
address.
There was a big crowd gathered at the
Battery pier when tne Laura M. Starin
was tied up there. The crowd went wild
as Ivory walked down the gangplank, ac
companied by Mr. Mclntyre. Hats were
tiunc in the air, canes were waved on
high, and Ivory was surrounded by an
enthusiastic throng. He shook hands
with everybody near by, and he and his
party then entered cabs and were driven
to the oflice of the Irish National Alli
ance, in tne Potter buildinc.
The gathering there was purely infor
mal. A number of friends and members
of the alliance gathered about, but they
saw very little of Ivory, as he was closeted
with Mr. Lvroan, General Keiwin, Colonel
P. J. Cody and one or two others. It was
said tu&t the purpose oi tuc conference
was to decide regarding the urging of a
claim for unjust imprisonment against
Great Britain. As a result oi the confer
ence Mr. Mclntyre was directed to look up
international law bearing on ivory's case,
and it sufficient grounds can be found a
claim for Indemnity for false arrest and
imprisonment will bo made through the
State Department at Washington.
Mr. Ivory went untown to his place at
One Hundred and Twenty-third street and
Lexington avenue, where a big crowd was
waning to give him a rousing welcome
home.
A SANTA FE STATEMENT.
Reasons Why It Opposes a Proposed Re
duction of Freight and Passenger
Rates.
TOPEKA, Kans., Feb. 4 âThe Santa
Fe Railroad Company this afternoon sent
a memorial to the Legislature on the pro
posed railroad legislation. The memorial
is signed by E. P. Ripley, and among
other things it says:
"The largest taxpayer and the largest
single interest in your State appeals ior
justice â it wants nothing more. Its in
terests are indissolubly involved with
those of your constituents. It can only
prosper as the State prospers; its prop
erty cannot be removed. It has suffered
in the depression of recent years as
severely as any interest in the State; it is
now struggling to earn for its owners not
an adequate return for capital invested in
it, which is impossible under present
conditions, but a small Interest on
a fraction of its cos". In earlier and more
prosperous times the Atchison, TopeKa
and Santa Fe, like most of its fellow
citizens in Kansas, permitted itself to ex
pand too greatly, for it built railroads as
citizens built towns â in the belief that
they could be sustained. The belief
proved to be lallacious, and as a conse
quence the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe has upon its hands some 2500 miles of
road in Kansas, mucn of which does not
pay operating expenses, and nearly half
of which contributes little or nothine to
payment of interest on the company's
debt. Yet there is not one of these
branches that Hoes not serve many com
munities, not one so poor that citizens of
its territory could do without it, so we
all must stay in Kansas and nope for
better times."
The memorial, which is very lengthy,
then goes into the situation in detail,
giving figures to show that a reduction in
the present freight and passenger rates
would not only be unreasonab;e, but
wou<d make it impossible for railroads to
as business and pay operatinc expenses,
and in the case of branch lines drive them
absolutely out of existence.
Mr. Ripley offers to throw open all the
books of the company to prove his state
ment? regarding the condition of the
road.
THE McKINLEY TARIFF AGAIN.
Campaign Pledges to the farmers of the
Country Will Be Kept by Repub
lican Leaders.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 4.â A Herald
special from Washington stays: The Re
publican leaders propose to fulfill their
campaign pledges to the farmers of the
country by a general increase in the tariff
rates on all agricultural products. While
tne Republican members of the Ways and
Means Committee have not formally
drafted the agricultural schedule of their
new tariff bill, they have practically
agreed on moat of the items.
With the exception of cattle, nearly
every farm product in the schedule will
be returned to practically the McKiniey
rates. The duty on catile, wh;ch is -0 per
cent ad valorem under the present law,
and which was $10 per head on cattle more
than 1 year old and $2 per nead on 1 year
old or under in the McKiniey act, will
be somewhat leas than under the McKin
iey act, but will be hi h enough to keep
out most of the Mexican cattle which
under the present law are brought into
the United States to be fattened in Kansas
and neighboring Stated before being sent
to market.
This change in the du-ty on cattle will
not be satisfactory to ail of the cattle
farmers of the country, for a considerable
number of men in Kansas, Colorado and
other States have found it much more
profitable to feed Mexican cattle for the
market than to raise the stock on tneir
farms. While the cattle-raisers of Texas
are thus to be eiven only a part of the
protec;ion they enjoyed under me Me-
Kmley law, the growers of barley, hay,
hops, beans ana other products with whsch
similar products in Canada come into
competition are to have a return to the
McKiniey rates on most artic.es.
The hens along the border are also to
have a return to tne McKiniey protection
of 5 cents per dozen on tue ee^s laid by
the hens of Canada. Butter and cnee^e
makers of New York are al>o to have the
duties on those products increased from A
cents per pound to 6 cents, and the raisers
of vegetables, whose principal competi
tion comes from the early vegetables grown
in the islands, are to have a substantial
return to McKiniey protection.

Jieport of AÂ«*r lork Chamber of Com-
mrrce Committee cm Finance.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 4.â The regu
lar montuly meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce was held to-day. Tne meeting
was well attended. The committee ap
pointed to attend the monetary conference
in Indianapolis, suoiniited its report
through its chairman, John Han&en
Rhoades.
In submitting the report, Jdr. Rhoades
spoKe in the most laudatory terms of the
action of the convention and the men who
participated in its deliberations. He pre
dicted that there can be no permanent
prosperity until the existing evils of ltu
currency and banking system are reme
died.
The report re?iews the proceedings of
the convention and the report adopted by
it, and says: "It is hoped and believed
that the action taken at this convention
will meet not only with the approval of
the banking and mercantile interests of
the country, but be followed by the people
at large, who will insist to tneir repre
sentatives in Congress that patriotism
should rise above partisan feeiinc, and
that all shall unite in one effort to restore
and maintain the credit of the Govern
ment and give to commerce and trade a
sound, solid, safe and elastic banking sys
tem.
"Submission to existing conditions is no
longer po-sible. The dangers ahead are
threatening, and something must be uone.
Your committee believes thai the action of
the convention has formulated an oreani
zation which can and will bring relief. It
has meant, and still means to do it. It
has not adjourned sine die, and wili not
so adjourn until its work is completed."
Isador P. Strauss moved that a com
mittee be appointed to consult with the
powers that be, and have embodied in the
call for an extra session of Congress a
request thai in addition to the tariff, the
monetary question be also considered.
The motion was adopted.

INQUIRY INTO THE
UKIAH MURDER
Ybarra Now Denies in Toto
That He Killed His
Employer.
Two Witnesses Before the Cor
cner Who Saw Him Wield
the Knife.
Preliminary Examination Set for N xt
Monday â The Victim's Funeral
Largely Atterded
UKIAH, Cai.., Feb. 4. â An inquest was
held this morning on the body of Benja
min Henderson, who was yesterday
stabbed to death by a man in his employ.
Tue Coroner's jury found that deceased
Tvas 6'J years of age and a native of Scot
land, and came to his death by three
Knife wounds inflicted upon him by one
Gregorie Ybarra, who is the man under
arrest.
The testimony of William Owens, who
was an eye-witness to the affray, was
substantially that Henderson had ordered
Ybarrato go out and skin a sheep that
had died during the night. This, it ap
pears, the man was unwilling to do. The
next Owens saw was the prisoner stabbing
the deceased. He says the latter had a
two-by-four scantling about three feet long
In his hand, but did not, so far as Owens
saw, strike Ybarra with it. Witness de
scribed the means employed by him to
stop the flow of blood from Henderson's
neck. He died, as stated, about three
minutes after the last blow was inflicted.
John McPherson, also an employe on
the ranch, stated that he heard consider
able noise and that this attracted bis at
tention. AH be saw wa3 the prisoner
cutting at Henderson for the last time,
and that while Ybarra was cut. ing him
Henderson was lighting him off with his
bands. He saw no stick in the latter's
possession.
The prisoner now denies in toto that he
inflicted any wounds upon Henderson,
but admits that he had some difficulty
with him in the early part of the morn
ing and that Henderson struck at him,
but that he simply pushed Henderson
away and did not cut him. He denies all
knowledge of the killing, and claims that
he was in his cabin until he was arrested
by the officers.
The knife that he yesterday stated he
was using in peeling potatoes at the time
of the affray was found by the officers at a
camp occasionally used by the prisoner in
summer, and which is situated about a
quarter of a mile from where Henderson
was stabbed. The knife seen in Ybarra's
possession en the day of the killing by
several parties, and â which he was to use
in skinning the sheep ordered by Hender
son, has not yet been iound. The pris
oner claims that the knife recovered by
the officers is the only ens he ever had.
At the autopsy heid on the body last
evening by Dr. G. \\ . Stout three knife
wounds were discovered, two of wuich
migtit be termed fatal wounds. The
wounds were all on the left side of ttie
dead man's* body, and therefore evidently
inflicted while he was facing his murderer.
One wound was in the neck, about mid
way between the ear and the collarbone,
extending to the bone, ana severing the
jugular vein and carotid artery. The sec
ond was just below the shoulder, striking
the fifth riD. The third was between the
eighth and nimhribs, about eight incbes
from, the backbone, penetrating the cav
ity. Each of the wounds was about an
inch in length.
The preliminary examination of Ybarra
has been set for next Monday at 10 o'clock.
The funeral of Henderson took place to
day, and a lar^e cortege followed the body
to the grave, at the Masonic Cemetery.
He was buried under the auspices of
Abell Lodge No. 146, F. and A. ML, of
which organization he was a prominent
member.

AKJZOSA'S lItKASVHER SUED.
Complaint Alan filed Against Bit
Bondsmen for 912,000.
PfICENIX, Axiz., Feb. 4.â To-day the
Attorney-General hied a complaint against
James A. Fleming, late Territorial Treas
urer, and his bondsmen in two official
bonds given by him while hejwas Treas
urer, for alleged breach of botb, for the
sum of 112,100.
The complaint alleges that Fleming,
while Territorial Treasurer, demanded of
his predecessor as such Treasurer, and re
ceived from him as such Treasurer, funds |
of the Territory which came into his
bands on account of certain transactions
with certain Territorial funding bonds
from Seasongootl & Mayer, and that on
his retirement from the office of T/easurer,
instead ot delivering the money to his suc
cessor, as his successor did to him, he car
ried it out of tne treasury and refused to
surrender it to his successors or to the
Territory, although demands have been
made for the money.
Tue action is in two counts, one against
the bondsmeu on his general bond and ihe
other against the bondsmeu on tue addi
tional bond required by the funding act,
under the terms of which, it is alleged.
Fleming received the money and was
empowered to receive it. The action goes
on the theory that all money received by
the Territorial Treasurer, as such, on ac
count of the Territory, if kept or con
verted, and not turned into tne treasury,
to be held by the successor, is
a breach ot t:ie official bond that
authorized the Treasurer to receive it, and
a breach of official duty, too, which ren
ders the bondsmen liable.

FIRE AT REDWOOD CITY.
Great Damage to the Grand Hotel and
Instruments of the Telegraph and
Telephone Companies.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. 4.â At 7
o'clock this morning an alarm of tire was
turned in at station 2 at this place. The
fire was discovered in the office occupied
by the Postal Telegraph Company and the
Sunset Telephone Company, situated in
the back of the Grand Hotel building. It
was noticed first by John Conover, one of
the proprietors of the hotel, who attempted
to extinguish it by throwing on a bucket
of water, in consequence of which he
received quite a severe shock of electricity.
The tire company soon appeared and
extinguished the flames, thougn not be
fore considerable damaee to the building
and instruments of the telegraph and tele
phone companies had been done.
The cause of the conflagration is vari
ously accounted for, one theory being
that the local electric-light wires, which
in many places are quite loose, had dur
ing the sto-m become crossed with the
telegraph and telephone wires, thereby
overcharging the latter, with the result
that the current left the wires and ignited
some papers lying on the operating-table.
Another is that the wires were surcharged
by reason vf the electrical disturbances
noticed in the atmosphere early this
morning. The entire telegraph and tele
phone apparatus was burned out and
damaged beyond repair.
On learning of the fire the officials of the
telegraph and telephone companies sent a
man from San 1- ra::c.s-co to replace the
damaged instruments with new, which he
says luay take three or Jour days to do.
The operator lost all the messages sent
through the office during the last month.
The damage to the building wes entirely
covered by insurance.

tions on its dam and flume near the
mouth of the Little tiur River, twenty
miles down the coast from Monterey.

ments in this ctiy for material to be used
in the construction of the flume, power
house, etc. Ha will leave with a force of
workmen ior the south as soon as it is pos
sible after the present rainstorm.
Tnis power company was organized here
about two years ago and commenced oper- j
ations on the cam and water flume, but J
owing to some legal difficulties in regard |
to water rights, etc, was compelled to dis- 1
continue work after almost completing the I
dam. Everything now being settled, the
company will begin the construction of a
plant at the .Little Snr River costing $45,
--000. Major DandrUge will have full
charge of the work, and expects to com
plete it in August.
The operating of this plant includes a
flume two miles long and a large Pelton
water-wheel to generate the power. The
Dower so generated will be transmitted by
electricity to Monterey and Pacific Grove,
where it will be used for electric light,
! street railway and other purposes. The
i company claims it will be able to deliver
about 1200 horsepower. The power-house
will be built on the bank of the Sur and
the distance for trie power to be transmit
tea from the power site to Monterey 11
twenty-two miles.

Great Preparations for Entertaining

CARSON, New. Feb. A. âWilliam Wheel
ock, Dan tftuart's partner, arrived here
to-day. He went at once to A. Livings
ton's saloon and the two were closeted for
an hour. On coming out of the conference
he exhibited a telegram from Stuart say
ing that both Corbett and Fitz-immons
would train in Nevada and would be on
their way this week and that Stuart would
reach here Sunday or Monday.
When asked about the location, \Vheel
ock said that would be settled on Stuart's
arrival, after loosing into the facilities in
everyway; that he had never given any
information about location in any man
ner, as he did not know and would not
know until Stuart's arrival. He remarked
that he would remain either here or in
Reno until that time.
When asked about the prospects of a
good attendance, he said everything indi
cated a very big attendance, especially
from the large cities, where special trains
were being chartered by Board of Trade
men and brokers, and that San Francisco
was thoroughly awake and would send a
big delegation.
Regarding Federal interferenca be said
teat matter gave him no concern what
ever. He said they bad the best legal ad
vice in the country on that point months
ago, and the opinion of Judge McKenna
only confirmed it
Virginia City people have now aban
doned the idea of bringing off the fight in
so high an altitude as the Comsiock and
are for Carson almost to a man. The
Carson promoters now depend on Storey
County to see that they get the mill as
against Reno, ana know that the com
bined forces can repeal the bill if Carson
is not solected as the battleground. Be
yond this there is nothing new, and
things will remain in abeyance until
Stuart arrives and starts up the machinery
apain.
The city is filling up with strangers
looking about for places to start up vari
ous kinds of businesses in order to catch
some of the money expected to begin to
circulate here about the Ist of March.
Carson is already beginning to receive
benefits from the proposed i"u.'ht, the Vir

It is positively stated that Fitzsimmons

clasa condition. Betting on the contest is
even, Corbett, however, being a little the
favorite. A large crowd gathers at the
depot every day to watch arrivals, it being
thought that the pugilists will dron in as
quietly as possible to avoid being bothered
by newspaper men, etc., until they become
settled and rested.
EXCITED SPORIISO JtfÂ£>.
Seek to Learn Why Fits Tore Up the
Agreement.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 4.â Sporting
men from all parts of Greater New York
crowded into the apartment* of Al Smith,
final stakeholder for the Corbett-Fitzsim
moiia fight, at the Gilsey House this morn
ing to learn what would be the effect of
Fitzsimmons' action last night at the
Bartholdi Hotel, when he tore up the
stake agreements after the papers had
been Bent to him for bis signature. All
sorts of rumors had been circulated among
the sporting fraternity last night and this
morning, most of which were to the effect
J that the tight had been declared off.
Mr. Smith said: "Fitzsimmons merely
destroyed an old agreement as to stakes
which has no bearing on the riant what
ever. What his reasons were for tearing
up the paper I cannot say. It was prob
ably another exhibition of his extremely
eccentric nature."
The paper which Filzsimmons destroyed
was an agreement which he and Cor
bett signed some time ago to fight for a
side bet of $5000 before the club offering
the most flattering inducements before
March 1,1397.
Manager Brady, who looks after Cor
bett's interests, decided to renew the
agreement for the fight on March 17 if
Fitzsimmons agreed. It was the exten
sion of this agreement which awaited
Fitzsimmons' signature when he tore up
the papers.
Fitzsimmons did not give any particular
reason for wanting the agreement de
stroyed, but it is said by persons who
know him that he wanted to give Corbett
an opportunity to raise the side bet if he
wishes it.
WAXTS TO MEET ttIIARKRI.

PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 4.â As both
Maher and Kharkov intend to challenge
the winner of the Corbett- Fitz;immons
tight next month, John J. Quinn, man
ager, and Michael Connolly, backer, for
Maher, to-night niade the following
proposition to Sharkey :
Peter Maher will fight Sharkey in Ne
vada for any purse Dan Stuart will offer
and a Bide bet of from $5000 to $10,000. If
Maher don't win thÂ« match he will not
challenge the winner of. tbe Corbett-Pl!z
simmons fight. If Sharkey is defeated,
then Maher is to challenge the winner of
the big battle.
"Maber, "said his manager, "is satisfied
be can easily defeat Sharkey, and has no
doubt about his being able to defeat
either Corbett or Fitzsimmons. We de
sire the public to know that Maher is
willing to meet SnarKey and show that lie
can defeat him, and be fully entitled to
challenge the champion, no matter
whether it be Corbett or Fitxsimmons."
STOCKTOA'S lii.M'll SHOW.
Kennel Club in a Quandary Veer the
beltctien of a Judge.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 4.â The Stock
ton Kennel Club is still in a quandary
over its next bench show. It wants to
cancel its contract with Mason and have
J. Otis Fellows judge tlie dogs, but Mason
will not have it that way. The !a:est move
is to hire Fellows in addition to Mason
and divide the work. It is thought that
each might make some reduction from his
original price, and that such a thing would
be ol benefit to the show. It is thought
that most of the members are in favor of
this, and it will be brought up at a meet
in-' to be held to-morrow night.
Dr. Davenport, who went to San Fran
cisco last night as a member of the advis
ory committee of the Pacific Coast Advis
ory Board of the American Kennel Asso
ciation, returned to-day, and action was
taken on tue dispute over the question of
judge*. The meeting is liable to decide
whether or not a dog show is going to be
held, as if the wrangline goes on and the
committee do not get to work the prepara
tions cannot properly be made.

JURY DISAGREES
IN SANDERS' CASE
Stood Four for Acquittal
and Eight for Con
viction.
Discharged by Judge Webb, Who
Sets the Next Trial for
March 15
District Attorney Snow Will Not Rest
Until H? Has Secured a
Conviction.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 4.â After deliberat
ing twenty-four hours without being
able to agree, the jury in the case of W.
A. Sanders was discharged just before
noon to-day by Judge Webb. Eight men
were for conviction and four for acquittal.
Ten ballots were taken, but the result re
mained unchanged.
As soon aa he had discharged the jury
Judge Webb reset the case of the people
against W. A. Sanders for trial on March
15 next. Nothing was said about the bail
of the defendant, nor did he make appli
cation to have it reduced. The four jurors
who voted for acquittal were John C.
Moore, William Lloyd, D. A. Dunbar and
R. L. LeonbarL Mr. Leonhart acted as
foreman of the jury, and just after the
court formally discharged it he asked the
Judge if the members were not forbidden
by the law from discussing under any
circumstances what transpired under their
deliberations.
"No; you can talk all you want to now,"
was Judge Webb's reply.
The jurors who voted for conviction ex
pressed some dissatisfaction at the action
of the four men in the case. It appears
that there was very little argument in the
jury-room. Mr. Leonhart seemed to be
the only one who would engage in any
discussion.
"We could have argued the case until
doomsday," remarked District Attorney
Snow this afternoon, "without changing
the minds of these jurors."
It appears that the main point advanced
by Mr. Leonhart, as spokesman for tho.se
favoring acquittal, was the testimony of
Albert L. Stetson and Charles H. Cham
bers, who believed they had seen Wootton
in San Francisco after February 1, 1894.
.None oi the jurors cave any considera
tion to the testimony of Robert Anderson,
who said that Sanders had tried to manu
facture testimony for his defense.
Professor Sanders and bis wife feel much
encouraged over the result. They had not
expected an acquittal, and iheir hopes for
a disagreement were realized. The de
fendant's bail at present is placed at
$5000, which he cannot furnish. Hit at
torney, Frank H. Short, stated yesterday
that he would probably move to have the
amount reduced. This was the second
time his trial had resulted in a disagree
of the jury, and the defendant's attorney
thinks of course that his client ia entitled
to have bis bail fixed at a lower figure.
District Attorney Snow is determined to
secure a verdict in the case. He stated
to-day that he will prosecute the case
again "with all the vigor that is in him."
He stated that be would resist any motion
for the reduction of Banders' bail.*

Multitude* of Small fish Washed on the
Braeh and Cnpturrd.
' PACIFIC GROVE, Feb. 4.-A curiout
phenomenon is causing great interest to
tbe citizens of this city among the pines
and tbe visitors from tbe East and else
where who are here are wondering what
sort of a town they nave got into. At low
tide yesterday a New Hampshire man
who was walking along the cliff above the
beach noticed that each wave of any siza
would as it rolled in bring with it a quan
tity of small, apparently live objects
and leave them as it receded. When
he examined more closely he was amazed
to find that the squirming things were
sardines and mackerel and seeing that
they wera in perfect condition he captured
a Â«w of them.
Or. his way he told of the wonder be had
come upon and soon the beach on both
sides of .Lovers Point was lined with eager
tishermen and women. As soon as the
tide rose, however, it was no longer possi
ble to pick up the fish from the sand, but
as tbe waters immediately adjacent to the
beach were full men went out in small
boats and by dragging nets, or even com
mon potato sacks, bad no difficulty In
making a rood catch. Hundreds of sea
birds were about to dispute for possession
of the fish and the racket they made was
considerable.
The explanation of the phenomenon a3
eiven by the local fisberm-n is that the
sardines ana mackerel were driven so far
into shore by their natural enemies,
whales and sealions, both of which have
been frequenting Monterey Bay of late,
that they ran Into shallow water and so
were caught by the waves and carried up
to the sand.

ORDERED OUT OF PORTLAND.
Burr Ferguson, a Most Notorious Confi-
dence Operator, Must Seek
Pastures New.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 4 âBurr Fergu
son, one of the most notorious confidence
operators in the country, claiming to be
seekine recruits here for the Cuban army,
was ordered out of town to-day. In 1888
he married *he orphan daughter of a
once weil-known citizen of New Orleans
possessed of considerable wealth, among
which was $30,000 in bank. T c honey
moon had !-carcely been obscured by what
is nnjusily termed matter-of-fact married
life when Ferguson's first criminal act
became notorious.
It was laic in the year of his marriage
that he drew $J5,000 of his wife's money
out of a bank on a forged cneck. Early the
following year he made his advent in
Honolulu.
Meanwhile Mrs. Ferguson's friends
urgently suggested that the officers of the
Department of State at Washington be
asked to devise some means to bring this
scoundrel back to New Orleans; but Mrs.
Ferguson, being of a retiring and sympa
thetic nature, declined to sanction the
adoption of pucli a measure.
News of Ferguson's infamous delin
quency did not reach the islands until
long after he had won favor at the dusky
court and had married into a branch of
the royal family. The expose occurred in
1891.
The affair was not allowed to appear in
the papers, and for prudential reasons it
was not loudly discussed on the street
corners of Honolulu. Ferguson was sent
away from the islands, but not without
carrying a considerable sum of royal gold
com with him. lie then kept from puolio
view until 1894, when he was arrested in
Boston for counterfeiting, but he was not
convcied. Since then he has been in the
toils in several other cities lor confidence
operations.
TO PASSENGER AGENTS.
Chairman Caldwell of the Association
Writes a.n Important Letter on ihe
Endeavor Convention.
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 4.â Chairman
B. D. Caldwell of the General Western
Passenger Agents' Association has just
written a highly important letter to the
agents of tne West concerning the policy
to be pursued by them in the matter of
rates to and from San Francisco during
the coming Christian Endeavorer conven
tion. The letter was supposed to be a
secret, but its contents have been secured.
It read as follows:
Chicago, 111., Jan. 28, 1897.
To Members: It has come to our notice that
certain personally 'conducted excursion
agencies (particularly first-class agencies)
contemplate making provision for controlling
under their auispices business to San Francisco
and return, at the rates agreed upon, ior the
Christian Endeavor meeting to be held in
July, 1897. In order to remove misat>preben
sion, and prevent complications likely to
arise thereirum, the undersigned, in con
formity with the provision of the agreement
by which it is mÂ»ae my duty 10 devise and
enforce proper regulations for an equitable
division ot the business moving or tne rates
and arrangements for the Cnristian Endeavor
meeting, respectiully fives notice that the
obligations resting upon lines, parties to this
agreement under the resolution providing ior
division oi traffic, would prevent them from
affording aid or facilities of any character
to such excursion agencies, in the
soliciting or controlling of such business, and
we believe that it is the duty of interested
lines, so far as it is within their control, to
prevent the solicitation and control of sucn
business by such excursion agencies, at i*ast
until such time as this may be specifically
stated as permissible under the chairman's
announcement of regulations to govern in
division of the business, and pending which
no action looking to the solicitation or control
of such bu-iaess tarough any sources should
be permitted.
All lines are respectfully requested to be
governed in accordance with tne above, and
lines on which so-called personally conducted
tourist excursions are run are specially re
quested to give notice to all concerned in con
formity herewith.

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR AltPASSES THROUGH
THE ASSEMBLY
Dibble's Bill to Prevent the
Pledging of Legislative
Candidates.
Earnest and Tel! ins: Argument
oi the Author Routs the
Opposition.
Fnsionists Ranted in Vain Against
the Measure That Promises a
W .'lconic R form.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Feb. 4.â When
Dibble's Assembly bill 170 came up on
linal passage in the Assembly this after
nooD, a heated discussion was precipi
tated, the Democrats and Populists, led
.by Shannon, objecting to^ the passage of
the bill and denouncing it as a scheme to
stop the mouths of orphaned candidates
Who had no political convention to lather
and mother them. The bill makes it an
offence for any one to require a candidate
lor a legislative office to pledge himself to
vote for a certain u:ll or a certain measure,
provided that such candidate be per
f 11 it ted to pledge himself before the con
vention placing him in nomination.
Dibble made a rattiing speech in which
he. said that no man can properly or hon
estly, represent his constituency if he is
bound .by a specific promi:Â»e to persons
nominating him or for special measures
or any particular bill. As soon as a can
didate receives the nomination for a leeis
lative office, men on both side* of differ
ent propositions approach him and de
mand that hÂ» should pleige himself to
vote for tbis bill or that bill, the demand
implying the threat that if he does not so
vo;Â« he will be blackballed at the polls.
"No man." continued Dibble, "is lit to
be a legislator who is not free to go into a
board yf supervisors or a board of educa
tion or into the Legislature absolutely free
to vote -on one side or theotherof any and
every question. It is one of the evils of
the day that men continually demand
pledge* of candidate^ â men who have no
right to do so. This bill provides that he
may make pledges to the party or conven
tion which nominates him. No one but
bis party has a right to exact any promise
from him."
North of Alameda argued that the bill
would save candidates from much annoy
ance.
. Bridgford remarked that annoyance wnÂ«
Incident to the business of running for
bffice.
' When any one asks me what I think of
any proposition," he added, "I am always
ready and willing to teii them, and if they
don't want me then I will stay away.''
"It is in the ripht direction of reform
and pure politics." said Canovan.
."In San Francisco every minute in the
day," said Mahoney, "we have hundreds
of petitions presented to us for our signa
tures on one thin? or anoihei, and it is
very annoying to all of u c . If anybody
wants anything in legislation he should
f.-o to the convention and have the conven
tion pledge tie candidates."
Lacy of San Francisco made his maiden
speech in a gentle, maidenly way. He
hoped that the bill would prevail. He
had been importuned by different persons
to sign different things. "We ought to
come here to Sacramento untrammeled,
an i we should not be tied up with any
promise?," he added.
. Bettman complained that he hai been,
figuratively, stood up at the muzzle of a
shotcun, and he suggested, "in the inter
est of decent politics," that the bill should
be passed.
Hill complained that the bill did not
treat independent candidates fairly.
Mead denied that the bill prevented
the free expression of the candidate's
opinion on any subject on earth.
â¢ Treacy supported the bill.
Toland an>'. Shanahan opposed it-
Dibble said that the gen.l< nvn who had
criticized the bill did not understand it.
It did not prevent a candidate from ex
pres-ing his opinion on any subject. The
evil t. at is desired to be corrected is the
hab't that has grown up in tbii State of
standing candidates up and demanding
that they shall pledge themselves to vote
for this particular bill or that particular
measure. He had known instances where
. persons on both sides of a question had
roade such demands. During his recent
canvass fifty demands had been made
upon him by persons wno threatened to
defeat hi- election unless he would prom
â¢ ise to vote for this whisky bill or that pro
hibition bill or that fiah bill. How can
any man go before this Legislature, he
asked, if he is pledged to a measure which
be uas mi -understood and which he finds
to b*Â» wrong alter it has been discusse 1 on
the floor of the House?
"I believe in the representative Govern*
ment," continued Dibble. "No man can
b- free to renresent the people who sent
him to the Legislature unless he goe*
there frÂ°e from all piedges except to the
party which sent him there pledged to
maintain certain principles of govern
ment, until be can stand before his people
and hear the 'discussion on measures de
sizned to serve the public interests. I
hay? seen men come upon this floor with
written pledges, and have seen them
shake them in the faces of men who
lind signed piedges that they would vote
for a certain bill without amendment;
wnen it was shown that if the bill passed
without amendment it would defeat the
vety purpose for which it had been
framed."
A round of handclapping greeted
Dibble's remarks, and the bill was finally
passed by a vote of 45 to 20.

An Investigation by the Aanembly Re
trenchment Committee J* Commenced.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. The
| Assembly Committee on Retrenchment
â  began its investigation of the State Print
ing Office this afternoon. Mclick in the
chair. Governor Budd was absent, having
â  gone to San Francisco, and State Printer
â  Johnston did not appear.
Assemblyman Caminetti appeared as a
j witness and said that he bad conceived it
j to be his duty to inquire whether the ap
j propriation of $75,000 was necessary. He
â  found that no demand had been made on
j the State Board of Examiners for a
:' deficiency statement. He understood that
i Johnston had printed 10,000 copies of the
I grammars in defiance of the order of the
I State Board of Education. Two years a^o
Senator Smith wanted the statutes of the
! last session printed. It was estimated
that the printing of tho-e would cost the
State about $700, but the actual cost had
i been $7000.
The witness retold the old story about
the coal contract. The contract was let to
I the lowest bidder about a year ago, and
jon the day tuat the contract was let
Johnson bougut seventy-five tons of coal
from the old contractor, who was th*> suc
cessiul bidder, at the old contract price.
Assemblyman Bridgford said about the
same thing.
H. Rogers, general foreman of the State
Printing Office, testified that the volumes
of the (statutes printed were 30,000 in
number, instead of 10,000, and that the
paper alone cost $1700.
Governor Budu, said Mr. Rogers, had
i his siiaie of the patronage of the State
j Printing Office in the per.-ons of Mr. Sev
ery, a compositor, and Miss Crandon, a
helper in the pressroom.
The committee then adjourned.

Postage of the Bill Introduced by Sen
ator Pedlar.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 4.â Boxing
matches lor prizes, purses or profit of any
kind are prohibited by the bill introduced
by Senator Pedlar and passed by the Sen
ate to-day. It is as follows:
Every person who engages In, instigates, en
courages or promotes, either as principal, aid,
second, umpire, surgeon or otherwise: '
1. Any sparring or boxing mutch, or exhi
bition f'<r a puise or prize, or any boxing or
sparring match oi any nature whatever, either
with or without gioves. In any building or
inclosure. to which an admission fee is
charged; or

prize-rightini:, with or without glove*, is guilty
oi felony, and noon conviction shall be fined
not less ihun $100 <>r imprisoned in the State
prison not more than one year, or by Doth
â uch fine and imprisonment.
Senator Wolfe opposed the passage |of
trie bill lie ground that it would seri
ously interfere with the public exhibition
given by the Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco. He stated that a small admission
fee was sometimes charged by the club to
sparring exhibitions in order to raise
funds for the maintenance of the Institu
tion, but not for individual profit. He
also saw no reason, he said, why glove
contests for prizes should be proscribed.
Senator Pedlar came to the rescue of his
bill by saying that any club that depend
ed for its existence on exhibitions of this
kind ought to disband. He concluded in
dramatic style as follows: It any man
wants to bruise his feilow-man for profit,
let him hie away to the mountains of Ne
vada, but let them not ply their vocation
within the boundaries of California."
The bill passed by a vote ot 23 to 7.

DODGING THE TAX COLLECTOR.
The Southern Pacific Causes Embarrass
ment by Refusing to Pay lls Dues
at the Needles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 4.â The |
Southern Pacific Company maintains its
steadfast adherence to an old rule of avoid
ing the payment of its taxes wherever it
is possible. A late instance of its deter
mination to defer payment of its just dues
at tbe Needles, in tbis State, has caused
considerable embarassmeut over school
bonds.
In the year 1890 bonds were issued for
$.0,000, payable in five equal installments
of $4000 each, with interest at 8 percent.
Provision for payment of principal and
interest was made by levying a special tax
on the assessable property of the district.
T c railroad is one of the principal tax
payers of the district and has failed to pay
any part of its asses>ment in this line,
hence the first in^tulinient of interest on
ihe bonds has not been paid.
The Oakland Bank of Savings pur
chased these bonds, and now proposes to
take some steps to collect what is due on
the bondsâ the first installment of $4000
and the overdue interest. Yesterday At
torney McPike of San Francisco appeared
before the Board of Supervisors at San
Bernardino and laid the case before them,
requesting some action in relief of the
bank. The board, by a unanimous vote,
rÂ«Â«olved to prosecute to final oeteimina
lion such action as m necessary to collect
Irom the Southern Pacific Railroad the
necessary taxes, penalty and interest due
on the bonds, ou condition that the bond
holders shail hold harmless the company
from any cost, damages or liability as a
company by reason of such action. They
have engaged the firm of Dunn A McPike
as special counsel to assist in the prosecu
tion of the case. The District Attorney
was ordered to forthwith tile a complaint.

the wages of street railway employes in
this city to-day. All the employes on the

per clay, while conductors receive $2. This
is for day work of from ten to twelve
hours. The night shifts have averaged
about eight hour* and for these the Tem
ple-street men have received from $1 75 ;o
$2 per day for unpnien and conductors
respectively. The new rule gives the night
men 20 cents per hour without dstinction,
which on eight-hour shifts wo-iid give
both gripmen and conductors $1 60 per
night.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
Appropriation bills are looming up.
McKinley's Cabinet receives praise on
all sides.
The exposure of a liar is the vindication
of honesty.
The pilotage bill has struck a squall and
will need a good pilot to bring it safe

Sprinkling rosewater on a dog-kennel
wastes the water and does not improve

If as it is now expected, we can get a new

we will have on the glorious Fourth.
Utah has named her Senator and thus
one more deadlock is broken. The chances
now are that the next Senate will be a full
house.
The people who pÂ«y 50 cents for Butler's
autograph are the latest illustrations of
the old proverb about a fool and his
money.
A new competitor is in the field for the
Union Pacific roid, and Uncle Sam's
chance for getting his money back is im
proving.
Before we get through with Willie
Hearst's gang we will force them to vin
dicate Senator White and the Park Com
missioners.
As one result of the glove contest law,
Nevada is already gettine a great deal of
advertising for its picturesque manners
and thrilline statutes.
The Bradley-Martina may rejoice In the
knowledge that they have given occasion
to more sermons than any forty other sin
ners in tne four hundred.
In askine for detailed statements from
the watercompany the Supervisors should
have included a statement of money paid
to blackmail journalists.
The Examiner actually boasts of having
got a story from Butler, just as if the Li
Yang Yuen incident was not enough of
that kind of thing for awhile.
When tbe water and gas companies
make a full report of their accounts the
people will be able to estimate what rates
the Supervisors ought to fix.
If no money is paid to blackmailers the
great corporations of the City and State
will be able to conduct their business more
cheaply for the benefit of the people.
The vindication of Mr. Fitch from the
assaults of the lampooners and carica
turists of the Examiner was good in itself,
but it is not enough. There are others.
The facility with which Butler reels off
his fake stories shows that he mistook his
vocation when he became a murderer. He
ought to have been a decadent journalist.
It seems that Mark Hanna is not going
to have the satisfaction of taking a seat in
the Senate without making a race for it.
In tbe politics of Ohio, there are no soft
snaps.
If tbe report is true that Eastern hat
manufacturers are paying good prices for
jackrabbit skins, California has a chance
to start a new industry and keep it moving
on the jump.
Whenever an act of corruption on the
part of the Examiner is exposed Willie
Hearst throws the blame on some of his
subordinates. There is more sneak in him
than in a snake.
A resolution has been favorably reported
to the State Senate appropriating $5 a day
to bupply the Senate with pure water, and
it is evident times have changed since the
Legislature of a thousand drinks.
The Supervisors have gone in the right
way about the work of lixing water rates.
When all the facts are known, it will then
be possible to form a just estimate of what
is fair for both the people and the cor
poration.
The Kansas story of blow snakes enter
ing a farmer's house and killing his
children by breathing on them may be
true, but there will be a suspicion that
there was a breath of Kansas whisky blown
about the house by somebody.
Bear in mind that the real issue between
The Call aud the Examiner is not whether
water and gas rates shall be reduced, but
whether rich corporations shall be made
to pay blackmail to rascals and then make
it up oy charges on tbe people.
"Blackmail I levy," says Lawrence with
a smirk;
"1 also lie and never like to work;
"But I've my uses." Here his tone
giows fierce,
"I bleed rich Willie and I fatten Bierce."
Senator Vilas declared on Wednesday
that the resolutions favoring the Nicaragua
canal adopted by several Democratic
National Conventions were "idle expres
sions." It is therefore gratifying to know
that the Senator himself will be politically
idle as soon as his present term is over.
The report that the convention of the
Christian Endeavor Society was to be taken
away from Ban Francisco has been em
phatically denied. It seems to have been
simply a Chicago fake, and was probably
the result of some decadent journalist in
that city trying to imitate the Li Yung
Yuen story.
THE AMENITIES OF JOURNALISM.
The republication in the Examiner on Wednesday of an editorial published in The
Call in May, 1895, commending Mr. Hearst and his paper furnishes a good occasion
for reviewing the course of The Call under its present management toward that jour
nal and its proprietor and toward ttie State at large.
The present proprietor of The Call in assuming control outlined a policy calcu
lated to advance the welfare ot the State by putting an end to those local and personal
jealousies and antagonisms which had bo often prevented the accomplishment of
great enterprises. The aim of the policy was to promote harmony in the State and
to bring about an era of good feeling which would enable all classes of the people and
all the newspapers to work together in unity for the general good.
It will be remembered that at the time this policy was announced it was denomi
nated by other papers in the State as "rosewater." It was, however, well received by
the people and by most of the newspapers. The term "rosewater" was not applied in
derision. As a matter of fact there did at that time arise a new impulse toward
harmony among Californians, and whether The Call caused that feeling or not it
certainly promoted it. We have seen many good results flow from it. One of these
is the accomplishment of the enterprise of constructing a competing railroad in the
San Joaquin Valley and another is the harmony and success with which the people of
California have acted in the effort to obtain a representative of the State in the
Cabinet of President McKinley.
It was in accordance with that policy The Call wrote its courteous words of Mr.
Hearst on the eve of his reported departure for a voyage around the world. We com
mended the Examiner then as we did all other papers in the City and in the State.
We had at that time no knowledge of ai.y corrupt practices on the part of Mr. Hearst,
nor had his paper then become so extravagantly sens-ational and so low and coarse as
it la now. Our commendation, therefore, was given in good faith, and as an evidence
that we cherished no jealousy agaiust our competitors in business, but were ready
and willing to give them credit for all that any of them could do to advance the wel
fare of California.
The courtesy of The Call was not well received by the Examiner. The managers
of tnat paper had knowledge which we did not possess. They knew that they were ex
torting money from corporations, that they were subsidized by the Southern Pacific
Company, that they were reachine for blackmail in every direction, and that the re
port of Mr. Hearst's voyage around the world was a lie. Knowing tnese things,
they knew ihat any permanent alliance with The Call was Impossible. They could
not hope for continued favor from an honest journal any more than from honest
people, and they began at once a course of attack against The Call designed to bring
its proprietor into disrepute and to injure the business of a rapidly growing rival.
The course of events soon led to the exposure of some of the corrupt practices in
the Examiner office. It was made known that at the vÂ«ry time while the managers of
that paper were loudly asserting their regard for the public welfare thpy were drawing
secretly a subsidy of $1000 a month from the Southern Pacific Company.
Mr. Hearst has indeed tried to exonerate himself from the baseness of this secret
betrayal of the interests of the people by throwing the biame upon his subordinates.
His attempts in that direction, however, were more than counterbalanced by the fact
that he did not prosecute any of those subordinates for robbing him, and it is there
fora evident that they had duly turned the subsidy into his pocket. Moreover, in the
face of this charge he soon appointed to the control of the Examiner the notorious
Andrew Lawrence, whose familinr nickname of Long Qreen sufficiently attest* his
character and his repute in the community.
As soon as the exposure of the secret subsidy was made the Examiner became
more open in its attacks upon The Call. It directed its malice not aeainst the paper
only, but against the proprietor and his relatives and personal friends. The man
agers of Mr. Hearst set to work their wits and their viciousness to assail the new
proprietor of The Calt, even more bitterly than they had assailed the former propri
etor, Mr. Fitch. All their lampooners, their caricaturists, their sneaks, spies, libelers
and maligners were turned loose upon The Call, its proprietor and his relatives to do
their vicious work as best they could.
In making these attacks the E.r>tminer was wise in its generation. The managers
of that paper knew that between themselves and an honest newspaper there must
Booner or later be antagonism and conflict. There can be no friendship between hon
est men and blackmailers. It was a matter of prudence, therefore, for Mr. Hearst and
his satellites to take time by the forelock and begin the attacks on The Call at once,
so as to partially discredit whatever exposures it might make of the villainous prac
tices in which they engage.
The issue between The Call and the Examiner is now made up, and it Is for the
public to decide between them. There should be no mistake made as to what is the
true nature of the issue. Our present controversy with the Examiner is not over a ques
tion of water and gas rates. We are as de^ irous as is every one else to see San Fran
cisco supplied with cheaper water and with cheaper gas. The i^sue between us and the
managers of the Examiner is simply whether disreputable newspapers are to be al
lowed to levy blackmail upon rich corporations. On that issue we confidently appeal
to tne public. The tight with the 'Examiner is not of our making, and we are waging
it not for personal advantage but for tiie general good and the protection of capital
from the assaults of blackmailers and extortioners.
THE RIGHT WAY.
The Board of Supervisors has gone about
the work of fixing wa>r rates in the right
way. Tbe Water Committee of the board
at a meeting on Wednesday formally
called upon the water company to give a
detailed statement of nil facts and sta
tistics which will be necessary for the
board to have in order that it may fairly
and accurately calculate what charges the
company shall have the right to make
upon tbe people. The demands cover
nearly every feature of importance iv the
business, and if honestly complied with
will furnish to the public as well as to the
Supervisors sufficient data on which to
base a just estimate of what should be
allowed to the water company and what
should be expected from it.
The information asked for is confined
strictly to what may be called the legiti
mate business of the water company. This
was perhaps as much as the board had a
right todemand, but it might have thrown
a broad light upon the present situation
of affairs in this City if it had called also
for a statement from the water company
of the subsidies which it pays to news
papers, or to those who manage them.
Such a statement might not have had
any effect in determining what were the
honest expenditures and legitimate net
income of the company, but would have
been very pertinent to certain questions
now before the public.
That the people of San Francisco desire
cheaper water rates is unquestioned. Men
always wish to get the most possible for
the least outlay. That is the first step in
economy. Men who do not have such de
sires are thriftless and wasteful. It is
therefore not only natural but rignt that
the people should expect from the Board
of Supervisors to make for them the best
terms commensurate with justice and fix
the charges for water lower than they
have been in the past, if that can be justly
done.
Between this general desire for a cheaper
and, therefore, more economical water
supply and a wild demand for such a re
duction in water rates as would despoil
the company and diminish the value of
invested capital there is a wide gulf. The
one is honesty and fair dealing. The
other is the outcome of dishonesty ana a
spirit destructive to every interest of the
community. There is no large number of
people in San Francisco who favor any
thing like injustice to the water company.
The wild clamorers against corporations
are noisy, but they are not numerous.
The great majority of our citizens expect
the Board of Supervisors to do what is
right and fair and they have every gratifi
cation therefore in noting that the steps
thui far taken tend in that direction.
To carry on the war in Cuba Spain has
had to levy a tax on bread, with the result

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1897.
THE FAKE AND THE FACT.
The Examiner has published for the past several days at the top of its title page
the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches "-â¢
' Of Ads During 1806.
* 5,964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner was probably not aware that a
careful record was being kept of the actual amount in inches of its advertising and
that in consequence it could be confronted with the following fact.
â â r lâ l t*i *ry .a. â¬,_ mj^i
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches Â©
Of Ads During 1806.
That is one fact, and here is another: j
â¢ THE CALL PUBLISHED "
239,551 Inches Â©
Of Ads During 1896.
~^ 3,023 More
Inches were published In THE CALL
than in the Examiner during 1806.
It is to be remembered that daring 1896 the Examiner published approximately
800 inches of illegal lottery advertisements, of which Thk Call did not and would not
publish one.
The monarch of the fakers has doubtless succeeded in securing thousands of
inches of advertising during the past year by dupine and deceiving advertisers through
false and arrogant assertions of the character of the foregoing fake. It would seem,
however, from the facts that the merchants as a rule have not been misled by its
fraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that its books are open to inspection, but we suggest that it
inspect its own books Defore it ventures upon the publication of another fake.

PBOSPERITY'S BETURN.
The complaint comes from some quar
ters that the prosperity promised upon
the triumph of MrKiniey has not put it
self much in evidence, and discontent is
felt because an overwhelming confusion
of the financial policy championed by
Bryan has uot come in the form of a great
rush of business â a magic transition from
deep depression to everywhere overflow
ing cups of plenty. These complaints
and discontents are signs of impatience
rather than of reason. After the long
depression caused by the Democratic
tariff prosperity cannot return in a single
season.
It will be remembered that for several
months after tDe resumption of Bpecie
payment in 1879 many of the great staple
products stubbornly refused to rise in
price, and the same questions as to the
whereabouts of promised prosperity were
aÂ«ked by the doubters of those days as
aro being querulously put now. Then, as
now, however, the good seed was slowly
germinating in ths ground, unseen by the
superficial observer, yet in bountiful
preparation all the same to turn the win
ter ol discontent into glorious summer.
A t the end of a year from specie resump
tion the average of railway stocks had
risen from $33 to $65, and in the third year
to $92 15. Investment stocks rose 42 per
cent in three years, manufacturing stock
45 per cent, and bank stock 20 per cent.
Notwithstanding the slowness of the start
and the continued clamor of the discon
tented, who were too blind to see the pro
cesses of steady growth, the statistics
showed that the volume of business grew
in one year more than 40 per cent, and in
three years the earnings of the railroads
had reached tie immense increaÂ»e from
$490,000,000 to $725,000,000.
Even if the return of prosperity now
were as slow and slight as those over
hasty critics would have the country be
lieve, its lingering is thus seen to be no
evidence that it is not abundantly coming
in the time required for a steady and
healthy expansion. A too rapid develop
ment is often the forerunner of a disas
trous crash in the world of business. The
long depression inflicted upon the country
by the folly of Democratic legislation is
already passing away, and before the year
closes we shall have evidences of a coming
prosperity as great as that which slowly
but surely followed the resumption of
specie payment.
GROWS GREAT PLURALITY.
Washington Post.
Representative at Large Galusha A. Grow of
Pennsylvania has the proud distinction of
having received at the last two elections a
larger plurality than any other candidate for
any office in any State in the Union. His
plurality in 1804 wss 246,462 an<? in the last
election it was over 2:)7,00(J, or 4000 more
plurality thÃn Mr. McKiuley received; in the
State. Another peculiar feature in Mr. Urow's
early political life was that he was legislated
out of office b7 bis own party. He represented
a district in 1860 that gave a majority of
about 10.000. Two other districts in Pennsyl
vania at, th.'.t time also gave overwhelming
Republican mnjnrities, and in redistricting
the State on the basis of the vote lor President
Lincoln, a strong Democratic comity was
a Mod to each one ot three Republican dis
tricts, in the hope ot preventing the election
of Democratic Representatives. The result was
ilisastrous, especially in the district which had
formerly been repreÂ«ented by Mr. Grow, for he
whs defeated in 1862 by 1400 majority. With
one exception, this district remained Demo
cratic for many years. Last year, however,
the same counties gave him over 11,000 ma
jority.

UNCLE SAM HAS FIRST-RATE WARSHIPS.
It was "Fighting Bob" Evans who remarked, when he heard that Spanish ire had beei

belligerents, that il Congress gave our battle
ships a chance at the Spanisn fleets the Span
ish tongue would very soon enjoy a sort of

He aid not say it in just those words.
Nevar mina tUat, however.
It is all very well to make those grandilo
quent boasts.
Kobody who it at all acquainted with your
Uncle Samuel has the least suspicion ol a
doubt of his ability to trounce Spain in short
order without even shedding his coat.
But the science of naval warfare has put
certain strong weapons into the hands of in
ferlor powers.
Those submarine torpedoes, for instance,
could be made to play havoc with big iron
clads in their present condition.
One of those death-dealing missiles approaching unseen a formidable battle-ship, and shat
tering the hull beiow the surface ol the water, might sink a veritable army to the bottom of
the sea in a very tew minutes.
But science has come to the front again with a means to protect battle-ships from torpedo
attacks.
The torpedo will stand not a ghost of a show when the new scheme is adopted by the navy.
This is interesting.
With tne new torpedo-killer In use Evans might, in csse of such a war as the one that was

It isn't news to you, perhaps, that the ancient Egyptians appreciated the cat as a house

that its mummy is found entombed along with those of Pbaraohs and high priests.
The Aryan leeend, "The Cat of Knowledge," which has come down to our times and
climes as "Puss in Boots," is evidence of the estimation In which the animal was held on the

Last Tuesday night the hall in which Ivy
Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star holds
its meetings was crowded with members and
visitors to â¢witness the Initiation of two candi

witnesses of the rendition of the work In a
manner that won for those who conducted it
the openly expressed laudation of many. The
ceremony of initiation in this order it a most
beautiful one, and when it is well performed,
as it was on Tuesday night, it creates a feeling
of the most intense admiration for those who
are joined in the bond of fraternal love. After
the singing of the closing ode there was an
adjournment to the banquet hall, where a fine
collatiou was served to the members and visi
tors. During the evening there were short

proved himself an admirable after-dinner
speaker, and the manner In which he ac
quitted himself insures for him an engage

FIRST CATCH YOUR HARE
The Hare Is Caughtâ Both Railroads
Are *'orfe.ile&.
To the Editor of the San, Francisco CallâSin:
For years there has been talk of Government
ownership o f railroads, but how are we to get
possession of the roadsâ how first catch the
hare? That has ever been the question of the
objector, ana whatever others may think, he
has insisted that his question has never been
answered, at least not to nis satisfaction. But
at last he has an answer. That objection no
longer exists so far as the Union and Central
Pacific railroads are concerned, though the
general public seems to be ignorant of thisim
portpnt fact. At first thought it is cause for
astonishment that such ignorance is general,
and but lew even suspect the truth of tho
mutter; yet who can name the great daily
newspaper which has giveu the subject a thor
ough investigation ? I can name but oneâ the
Philadelphia Itemâ a stalwart Republican
newspaper which champions and glories in
genuine reforms.
In a strong editorial of December 29 last
tbe Item calls attention to "the long and
strikingly able speech of Senator Morgan of
Alabama," in which he declares that in "the
Charter of the Union Pacific and Central Pa
cific roads, and in various measures which
have become laws since the charters were
granted, there was fixed in iavor ol the United
States a strict statutory lien upon these prop
erties which lias never been surrendered ana
which differs d'ametrlcally from a mortgage,
providing specifically that upon the failure of
these corporations to meet the payment of the
maturing bonds the whole properties of these
companies are forfeited by the operation of
law. Both these corporations "having de
faulted in their payments, they have no more
right in the properties covered by their char
ters than has auy citizen." In tact, "their
right of property ceases and passes by opera
tion of law into the hands of the Govern
ment."
According to Senator Morgan "these proper
ties belonged to the Government when the first
lorteiture occurred." He goes on to say that
"numbers of eruuite gentlemen have insisted
that the Government ought not to own tuese
properties, and they have seemed to Buppo^e
that it would require some new legislation for
that ownership to come about; whereas, in the
very charters under which these railroad
companies were organized, a proviso for tho
ownership of these properties by the Govern
ment was expressly made, the conditions all
stated and tne manner of acquirine actual
possession provided for; and to-day, instead of
having to enact laws to take possession of
these properties, or to declare a forfeiture ol
them if we propose to sell them, we shall have
to repeal the laws which now stand."
This explicit statement of the law and the
facts in the case is not denied or controverted.
It thus appears that the hare is caught â the
Government now owns one of the great trunk
lines traversing the western half of the conti
nent, and it is in order for those men and
newspapers which have so vociferously and
strenuously opposed the infamous lunding
bills, but felt constrained to remain silent as
to Government ownership while these billi
were pending before Congress, to announce
their championship of their concealed con
victions and declare for Government owner
ship and operation of these forfeited roads.
As the Item of January 15 pointedly lays:
"No question is raised in congress over the
right'of present Government ownership, but
it is being willfully ignored. Congressmen
who refer to it are sat down upon," and "there
are newspapers in plenty who by silence or
open support arc willing to see the public de
frauded.''
In a ringing editorial, January 25, the
Item warns the people "that there is a scanda
lous deal afoot to rob the public in the matter
of the Union and Central Pacific railroads."
"This new^form of robbery, embracing many
millions, as the throwing away of the present
Government ownership of these roads, ac
quirea by the original contract with the Got.
eminent in 1802, which provides that in de
fault of payment by the railways of the ma
tured Government bonds, default beginning
January 1, 1897, these railways become the
sole property of the United States. Under tho
command of President Cleveland foreclosure
proceedings began two days since, January 23.
to sell the Union Pacific and the Kansas Pa
cific at a public sale; but according to pub
lished reports this whole procedure was insti
gated by the security-holders outside of the
Government, beaded by the old ring which
has already made so many millions most scan
dalously out of the Government."
Our silent friends who profess to believe in
Government ownership are also warned by
tho Item that "although the sale must be open
and public, In form at least, the ring which Is
in fact forcing the sale comprises all the
known bidders in the market. This ring is
prepared to put the sale through with a rush
before trie public and Congress really compre
hend what is beiug done." There is also a
plot to depreciate the value of the Central Pa
cific property, ns dependent on the Union
Pacific, by the salÂ© of the latter road first. No
one believes that the Government will realize
much by the sale to the ring of these railroads,
while the opportunity will be lost to operate
them as Government roads. It seems to me
that the whole country ought to be ablaze
with indignation over this bold and impudent
betrayal of a trust of such magnitude to the
Nation, and that the people should arise in
their might and assemble in vast mass-meet
ings In every State of the Union to thunder
their anathemas against our public traitors
and thwart this gigantic scheme of plunder
and prevent this National calamity. But Is
there any hope that it will be done ?

The American Schooner Nokomis
Mad? a Smart Voyage From the
Hawaiian Isles.
The American schooner Nokomis got in
from Hilo, Hawaiian islands, yesterday
in the smart time of twelve days. She
made a pretty picture as she lurled her
sails and dropped anchor in the vicinity
of the Swanhilda. Captain Roos says
that it was the rou^ht^t voyage he ever
experienced, and that lie sighted nothing
in tne shape ot a sail from the day he left
Hiio until he reach? 1 the Farallones. The
wind being fair he refused a tow and
sailed into port. Tlic Nokomis is sugar
latien and will po to the refinery to-day.
There was more trouble among the men
on the C. D. Bryant yesterday. When
Captain Lee sailed bis vessel into port he
had two stowaways in irons. The men re
fused ;o work, so they were put on a bread
and water diet. Lost Wednesday night
they were locked up us usual, and the
chief officer saw 10 it that they wero
Btcarely handcuffed together.
Yesterday morning they were gone and
also tue captain 3 gig. Tne Jatter was
picked up by an incoming towboatand
returned to the barkentine. Later in the
Jay the men turned up at the Harbor
Police station and gave themselves up.
They had managed to sever the chain that
kepi them together, but could not g^t off
the cuffs and they wanted Captain Dun
leavy to help them out. The latter lis
tened to their tale of woe and went for
Captain Lee. The latter said he did not
want to prosecute them, and said if they
would row the boat back to the C. D. Bry
ant be would give them a note to the
mate instructing him to unlock the hand
cuffs and let them go. This the men
agreed to do, ana laier on they were put
ashore and now they say they will prose
cute Captain Lee for cruelty.
Deputy Sheriff Harris of Tulare County
was in an awkward predicament yester
day. He had a prisoner with him who
had been sentenced to :i long term in San

reached the Tiburon ferry he discovered
that he had left tbe commitment papers
behind him. lie toon his man orer to the
Harbor Police station and expla ned his
predicament. Captain Dunleavy took
charge of the man, and Harris at once
telegraphed for the commitment to be
sent on. In explaining the matter he
said that in changing bis clothes before
leaving he left the necessary papers in the
clothes he had laid off.
The question of pilotage, commerce and
navigation will evidently be well threshed
out during the present session of the Leg

Holmes of the Harbor Commission have
been summoned to Sacramento to give
evidence in the above matters, in so far as
they affect the port of San Francisco.
Commissioner Cole would also have gone
to Sacramento, but at the present time he
is confined to nis bed with a severe attack
of stomach trouble. His friends, how
ever, expect to see him out and about
again in a few days.
The steam schooner Farallon sailed
again on her regular run last Wednesday.
The owners have twice attempted to cur
tail expenses by cutting down the number
of the engineer's staff, and on each ocea-
Bion the Marine Engineers' Association
has protested. On the first occasion the
vessel was delayed several days and then
the owners gave in. On the second occa
sion the vessel was tied up and all hands
discharged. Finally she was again put
in commission and the engineers have
won the day.
Captain Ryder of the ship Elwell has
won another suit of clothes. He made the

call a halt or else raise the standard. The
Elwell made the run from Nanaimo in
thirteen days, which is very quick time
considering the adverse winds encoun
tered.
IN A HAZE OF SMOKE.
First Concert Given by the San
Francisco Symphony
Society.
Excitement Csus d by the Accidental
Burning of Some Paper at the
Columbia Theater.
Despite the weather the first concert
of the San Francisco Symphony Society
was well attended, and excitement was
not wanting.
During the first number, "Erne Faust
Overture" by Wagner, the attention of
the audience was suddenly distracted by
the atmosphere becoming heavy with
smoke, and the beauty of the music was
for a moment forgotten. At the close of
the number the smoke became almost un
bearable, and as the aulience was getting
restless it was explained that some paper
had been thrown on the furnace fire and
the smoke came in through the fines. The
musicians played in a decided haze tne
rest of the afternoon.
Dvorak's symphony in D major followed
and was beautifully interpreted by Mr. Hin
nchs' musicians and was enthusiastically
applauded. Mrs. Katherine FiemiaK-
Hinrichs made her initial bow to the San
Francisco public and sang an air from
Uounod's "Queen of Sheba" in inch a
manner as to win for her an encore.
Tachaikowsfcy's "Marche Slave" finished
the programme.

counterbalance meets the rafters.
Tropp was tightening some bolts, and,
knowing that he was working in the ele
vator shaft, the man in charge of the
machine called to him to ask if everything
was clear. "All rightâ go ahead!'' shouted
Tropp, and the cage was started.
Tropp's head was partially inside the
runway of the counterbalance, and he
most have miscalculated the time he had
in which to withdraw it, for the huge
weights caught him and almost tore his
head from his body.
C. M. Barrows, an employe of the firm,
said that something was wrone, and yelled
to the elevator man to stop, but it was too

Death must have been instantaneous,
for the cage was moving rapidly and the

Tropp's body was removed to the
Morgue, where his employer Charles
Kromburc, called later to make arranÃe

Tropp alone was to blame, ns he had given
the word to start the elevator and should
have at once withdrawn bis head from its
dangerous position. He also stated that
Tropp had no relatives in this City, nis
wife having died six or seven years ago.
Deceased was GO years of age and lived

that caused the accide..t was the one used
to carry the patrons of Smith's Cash

that he could give no lucid account of the
terrible affair except that the carpenter
told him to co ahead, and he had sap

ANOTHER SALARY
IS NOW IN DOUBT
Superintendent and Archi
tect on the Same
Footing.
One More Tangle in the Mission
High School Excess
Contracts
Auditor Broderick Thinks Ha Will
Return the Warrants Without
His Approvel.
Auditor Broderick said yesterday that
be had nearly decided to return, without
approval, the warrant for the payment of
Architect Havens of the Mission High
School. He also said that if the archi
tect's warrant cannot be paid neither
can the recently elected superintendent of
construction draw salary, for they stand,
legally, ou the same footing under the
existing conditions.
That Mr. Broderick questioned the
legality of Mr. Havens' claim as the archi
tect of the Mission High School has been
published in this paper earlier, out it will
come as news to the board that the com
pensation of the newly elected superin
tendent of construction may also be dis
puted by the Auditor. For the last few
days the Auditor has busily engaged him
self in the consultation of authorities and
the decisions of courts, accumulating the
law books in his private otlice until a
small-sized law library was there.
Yesterday he Baid that while his mind
was about made up he siill wanted to get
another opinion. There Is no dispute
that the plans have been prepared by Mr.
Havens. The trouble is that the con
tracts already awarded exceed the esti
mate made by Mr. Havens in an advisory
capacity for the use of tne board. Mr.
Havens figured the cost of the building at
$137,000. The contracts already awarded
amount to $140,138, or $3138 in excess.
Mr. Havens has figured his commission
on the basis of the cost of $140,000 iustead
of $137,000.
Auditor Broderick thinks that the
board, having accepted $137,000 as the
architect's statement of the cost, is bound
by that. Moreover, he ihinks ihat the
architect is bound to see that the structure
is built for that amount of money. How
the same general proposition has been re
cently viewed, in anotni-r case, is in
stanced by the Affiliated Colleges. The
contracts for the construction of the
Affiliated Colleges buildings having ex
ceeded the appropriation, the architect
could not get his lees out of the appropria
tion. Whether he will get the fees by a
special appropriation by the Legislature
or by what plan he will be paid the Audi
tor does not know, but tne Auditor holds
that under the general law, there is no
way to pay the architect of tho Mission
High School, and be thinks that the gen
eral law control* him. If there is no
money to pay the architect, there is no
money to pay the superintendent of con
struction.
Mogan Wants His Salary.
Joseph M. Mogan has asked lor a writ
of mandate to compel Auditor Broderick
to sign a warrant for the payment of bis
salary as Fish and Game Warden, which
office he formerly held. He says the Su
pervisors have no legal power to remove
him from that position.

"HOW THE DUTCH
TOOK HOLLAND"
Dr. Wendte Told the Story
in a Lecture Last
Night.
The History of a Brave People
Who Initiated Free In
stitutions.
Declared to Have Ben at One Time
Pre-eminent in A 1 the Wa ks
of Human Life.
Rev. Dr. C. W. Wendte of Oakland deliv
ered a lecture ai Golden Gate Hall last
night entitled "How the Dutch Took Hol
land," a splendid series of stereopticon
views adding greatly to the inherent in
terest of his subject, which was dealt with
in a manner both historically instructive
and entertaining.
Dr. Wendte in his introductory remarks
related how when a happy boy in his na
tive city of Boston the only grief he
knew was occasioned by his playmates,
who, on the strength of his foreign
patronymic, called him a Dutchman.
"They were unaware," said Dr. Wendte,
"of any distinction between the two
branches of the great Teutonic iamily,
but included them all under the ceneric
and mildly contemptuous term 'Dutch,'
whom our school geographies were want
to describe as brutes wholly given over to
gross and sensual pleasures."
Later in life, the lecturer said, when he
had removed to Sau Francisco, and in the
Mercantile Library of this City first pe
rused the glowinp page 3of John L. Mot
ley's "Dutch Republic," be lelt penitent
that even as a boy he should have been
ashamed to bear their name.
With this preliminary Dr. Wendte pro
ceeded to condense into an address of
something more than an hour the experi
ences and impression* derived la the
course of a ten days' tour in the Nether
lands. He described tne characteristic
phytirai aspect of the country, with its
marvelous system of dikes, which has
redeemed it from the inroads of the ocean
and has involved an expenditure of some
thing line $1,500,C00,000.
He reviewed the history of its most
notable cities and seats of learning and
tne associations which have made ihem
famous, and described the habits of the
people and the aspects of social life. In
conclusion he told of the heroic struggle
maintained for centuries against the hos
tile forces of nature and war with the
Spaniards, a struggle which culminated
during the supremacy of William of
Ornnce and his equally illustrious son
Maurice.
From the Hollanders, the lecturer in
sisted, the Pilgrim Fathers first obtained
their knowledge of free institutions, which
they in turn conveyed to this continent,
and thence it was that the English im
ported them into their own country.
It was a strange circumstance that a
people so essentially practical as the
Dutch have always beeu sUould have pro
duced one of the moat remarkable schools

The Teachers Object.
At a meeting of public school teachers held
on Wednesday it was decided to appoint a
committee of teachers on legislation to go to
Sacramento, especially in reference to tho
certificate biiL Tho rain kept many teachers
away. The discussion was informal. In addi
tion to tbe certificate matter, the changes pro
posed in tho pension law were also considered.
The objection to; the certificate changes is
based on the provision that teachers may
hereafter, when applying for a renewal of
certificates, be examined upon branches upau
which they were not originally examined.
"For instance," said one oi the teachers sar
castically, "how wohld it do to examine s
policeman for perpendicular penmanship, or a
lawyer or physician on their qualifications
tor playing the piano." The discussion was
earnest and energetic.

LEGAL STRUGGLE
FOR LITTLE EFFIE
Mrs. Holstrcm Files a For
mal Petition for Guar
dianship.
Swears She Will Not Give Up
the Search So Long As
She Lives.
William A. LighthaH, Father of the
Petitioner, Will Appeal to the
Courts.
Mrs. Lucinda Holstrom continues to
supplicate the powers that be lor the re
turn of her ward, but not legally adopted
daughter, Eliie R. V. Holstrom, concern
ing whom there has been so ruucn con
troversy in the Superior Court. Since the
child was taken from her custody she has
exhausted every device known to her to
ascertain the child's whereabouts. No
information has yet been obtained by her,
but she swears by her hope in heaven not
10 give over the search so long as she lives.
Sne declares that it will be impossible
for any one to keep her from finding the
child. Through her attorney, Leonard S.
Clark, Mrs. Hoistrom has filed a petition
in Judge Coffey's court to be appointed
the legal guardian of the child, hoping
thereby to obtain an order compelling
Officer Kane to disclose the little one's
hiding-place.
In her petition Mrs. Holstrom sets forth
tun: the child was born in this City
December 15, 1892, and was given to her
by the child's mother, an unmarried
woman, when the little one was six days
old. Mrs. Holstrom lurther avers as fol
lows:
"That ever since the 21st day of Decem
ber, 1892, and until the Ist of February,
1597, she has carea for, nurtured, clothed
and maintained the child and provided
lor its wants in the most careful and affec
tionate manner, and has treated her in
evtry way as though sue were her own
aud has become attached to her as fully
as though she were her own flesh and
biood. Also tnat the child has never
known any other mother ana nas been
happy and contented in her care and lias
been well and liberally provided for. Mrs.
Hnlstrom also says she is well able still to
cure for and to provide for and maintain
and educate Erne in a manner appropriate
to the cniid's necessities and condition."
No letters of guardianship have ever
been issued to Mrs. Hclstrom, nor lias she
ever legally adodea ttfie, not believing
tnat her custody of the little giri would
ever be questioned.
On the Ist day of February, 1897, one
.Frank J. Kane, she furtner avers, without
any right or authority, and witu force and
arms, and with great violence, and witn
threats and menaces, seized and carried
Erne away with him ana put Mrs. Hol
strom in great fright and terror, and de
prived Erne of the tender and affectionate
care which Mrs. Holstrom has always ex
tended to her. Since then Mr, Kane has
bad Etiie within his possession and con
trol, without any ri^ht or authority there
for.
Then MrR. Holstrom says that Effie is in
need of a proper custodian, who will care
for her as a mother should; that Effie re
sisted and protested with all her power
against being removed, but that in spite of
her cries and screams and remonstrances
she was forcibly seized and carried may
by Kane, to her great fear and trepidation,
grief and agony, and to the sorrow and
anguish of the petitioner.
Mrs. Holstrom additionally says she is
the only person capable of taking* care of
Effie, and that she is acquainted with her
wants and necessities, predilections and
tendencies, and is tha only person who is
a tit or proper gnaraian of her.
She also says that the mother, Sally
McGuire, is not a fit nor a proper person
to have the care or custody of Efhe, and
avers tnat the mother ol Effie does not
reside in San Francisco.
William A. Lighthall, father of Mrs.
Holstrom, is much attached to the little
girl and seems determined to get her
back.
"She was my little playfellow, and I
treated her and looked on ncr as ray own
granddaughter," said Mr. Lighthall.
"We all fairly worship her, and if there is
anything the matter it has been that we
have petted her too much. Some people
might thin* so, but I can't agree on that."
Like any one closely touched by a mat
ter of this kind, Mr. Lighthall reasons
sharply concerning Officer Kane's conduct
Id taking away the child. "If Mr. Kane
had aright to take our baby he would
have an equal right to take anybody's
baby, and then if an effort were made to
get back the child he could answer that he
gave it to a person who saia she was
the child's mother; and according to this
view there is no law to stop him. He
Ewears that he doesn't know the woman's
name. How, then, does he know that she
is the child's mother? How does Mr. Kane
know that my daughter is not the chilli's
mother? We had the child in our custody
and he entered our house by force, with
out warrant of law or order of court, and
on his own authority took the child. If
he nad a right to do that, then it is no
longer true tiiat a man's home is his castle.
"There has been no hearing in court to
decide between us, but I hope there may
be. He said my daughter was accused of
being a bad woman; I say that is noi irue.
She live? at home with her mother and
me, and is as good a woman aa there is in
tne world.
"It is easy enough to speak sianders of
any woman, but is a police officer war
ranted in trying the case against an ac
cused woman ou his own responsibility?
If so what is the use of the courts?
"If Mr. Kane bad a ri<ut to take away
my daughter's little one on the meresayso
of outside and interested parties and then
sneer in our faces when we ask for tne
â¢law's protection what are we to do? What
can we do? We may have to submit, for
we are not rich: but I will not rest under
such oppression without protest. 1 shall
cry oui tor justice for my daughter and her
little one uniil so cue righteous Judge shall
hear me."
The case will be called for hearing in
Judge Coffey's court next Tuesday morn
ing, the 9th inst.

Wedding.

Congratulation-
Mr. and Mrs. H. P. Spitz of this City
celebrated their golden wedding last
evening in the comfortably appointed
parlors of the Concordia Club, which
were also suitably decorated in honor of
the event. A limited number of t!ie most
intimate friends of the venerable couple
were invited to at;end and partaUe of an
elaborate dinner, which was tastefully
served in the course of the evening. No
less than three generations ot tue descend
ants of Mr. and Mrs. Spitz were represented
on this unique occasion, in tne persons ot
their children, their grandchildren and a
great-grandchild.
The lapse of half a century since first the
happy couple became man and wise l.a?
proved powerless to weaken the mutual
affection and respect of honeymoon days,
though that time, no doubt, has written
wrinkles on the brows of both. To them
has been accorded in full measure those
rewardH which should properly accom
pany virtuous old age, "such as honor,
love, obedience, troops of irieuus. "
Mr. and Mrs. Spitz were ably assisted in
the arduous but pleasurable duty of re
ceiving, by their daughters. Mrs." A. A.
Son, Mrs. H. Lyons and Miss Hannah
Spitz, and their sons. At>e, Jake, Theodore
P. and Isidore D. Spuz. The two last
named made a special journey from their
Eastern homes in order to rejoin the
family circle and swell the chorus of con
gratulations and good wishes, whicb were
so liberally bestowed upon their parents.
The toilettes of the ladies present were
in every case appropriate, among the
BON noticeable bein^: Mrs. L. P. Weil, j
in green brocade and rare old lace; Mrs.

petitioned Judge black to b- permitted to

basis of paying $l"Â», (XiO to each institution.
Six ot ti.e organizations have agreed to the

The societies to whom the sum of $15,000
eacn will be given under tne compromise
are a< follows: The Little Children's In

In the application for the settlement it
is stated that the validity of -he btquens
to these institutions is in doubt, and that
if payment of residuary interests provided

delay would ensue, and the aforesa.d
beneficiaries might lose all interest in the

supposed he had mistaken some one in
tbe United States for tbe late famous

But Dr. Haweis has tbe better of his
critics, as lie point* out in the following
letter to a London paper:
To the Editor of the Westminster Gazetteâ Sn:
It mi) liot be my business tounlighteu ignor
ant Americans about tiiclr own eminent men,
but it is certainly odd that no many American
newspapers and men of standing â like Dr.
Cuyler, for instance, whom you quote in your
issue of January 2â -appear to be unaware of
the very existence of ex-Senator Charles Sum
ner of San Francisco, whom I allude to in my
book, "Travel and Talk"â and from whom I
heard (I may say, in praise of that book), only
yesterday. I continue to receive every week
dozens of cuttings from America, ridiculing
me for supposing that Charles Sumnerâ the
famous Oharl-s Sumner who died in 1874â is
still alive. Who said he whs alive?â not I.
That any respectable journalist can be Ignor
ant of the work of that other Charles Sumner,
who so bravely led the attack on postal and
telegraph monopolies, and who i- now a very
well-known attorney-at-law at San Francisco,
and a familiar visitor to Washington, I cannot
understand. A blunder doubtless there has
been, but it is the Ignorant blunder of Ameri

the head of the delegation to defeat the

the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
favored, but which was defeated in Con

THE DAIRYMEN'S BILL.
Views of a Practical Man From
Petaluma en the
Subject.
L Tomasini G yes SumÂ« Facts and
Figures to Show How It
Will Act.
L. Tomasini of Petalnma writes as fol
lows on the proposed dairymen's bill, now
before the Legislature :
The opposition encountered by the dairy
men's bill, now before the Legislature, and the
doubt raised by some of its members of the abil
ity of the dairymen to understand their busi
ness and to tnke care of themselves, can oniy
be presumed as coming from a misunderstand
ing of the biil itself.
The bill provides ior the inspection of dairies
as to their sanitary condition and at the same
time inspect all animals used for dairy pur
poses ior infectious and contagious diseases.
The bill originated from the dairymen them
selves. The dairymen aud cattle-owners of
the State are most interested and none under
stand the dairy interests and needs better
than they themselves.
The interest iii the welfare and health of the
public Is an interest of the dairymen. Part of
all dairy products sent in to the market to be
sold to the public is used by the dairymen,
their wives and children. The dairy industry
1b undergoing its evolution. The time has ar
rived for new systems, new rules and regula
tions. The object of the dairymen's bill la to
purify all herds from diseased animais, to In
sure pure and Healthy milk, butter and cheese
for themselves as well as the public in a
manner that may be accomplished without
difficulty, without working an injury upon
the dairymen and at tne least possible ex
pense.
The idea of leaving to the County Boards of
Health to appoint veterinary purgeons to make
this inspection would be impracticable. In the
report of the Illinois Dairymen's Association
for 1896, Dr. M. R. Trumbower, State Veteri
narian, in answer to a question as to how
many veterinary surgeons would be required
to apply the tuberculin test to the dairy cows
of that State, baid be had figured that out and
found thnt in order to apply the test to the
1.900.000 cows in the Ktate, it would take 460
veterinary surgeons for eighteen months and
cost tne State $1,800,000. At thia estimate it
would require an army of eighty veterinary
surgeons to apply the test to the number of
dairy cow* in our fiiato ftt Â» cos t of not leu
than $330,000, which ia not the intention of
the proposed law and does not include the
value of the animals that would be condemned
and slaughtered under the test.
The main object of the law is to inspect dai
ries and creameries as to their sinitnry condi
tion aud to weed out animals whose physical
condition indicates that their milk is not fit
for food or products manufactured therefrom.
By this mode of inspection a large per cent of
diseased animals would be condemned as un
fit for dairy purposes.
The competent and practical dairymen who
by th.li bill will make the inspection will per
ceive a sick cow as readily as the watchtui
eyes of a mother notices some ailment among
the members of ncr family. It the inspector
is in doubt as to the nature and seriousness of
the disease he may call in a veterinary sur
geon in the same manner as a mother would
call a physician. The member* of the present
State Dairy Bureau, appointed by Governor
Budd to carry out the law ior the suppression
ol oleomargarine and filled cheese, are practi
cal dairymen, and by their efforts in enforcing
the law have driven these fraudulent products
out of the State at a cost of less than half of
the amount of money appropriated for the
purpose.
What the dairymen object to Is the radical
measures proposed by Boards o: Health giv
ing authority to veterinary surgeons to
slaughter all' animals where the mbrculin
test reacts without some provision to protect
them against unnecessary losses.
It is admitted by all authorities on cattle
diseases, both iv the old and new wond, that
the tubercuun test is the best means of defect
ing tuberculosis, but it Is also admitted that it
cannot be regarded as certain it-gal prooi or of
absolute reliability at all times. A dairyman
may wish to have further knowledge and
prool in regard to the di-ease bef>>re the sus
pected animals are slaughtered. It is not for
the sick cow whose usefulness is apparently
destroyed by disease so as to justiiyhir de-
Btruci ion that the dairyman UKSlorcompen
saiion; it is for the cow that is so Slightly af
fected as to not affect I.er product, or for those
destroyed through the mistake of the officials,
that the dairymen demand compensation.

A MILLION
Mrs. Stanford to Part With
Many of Her Valuable
Acres.
The Money Will B5 Used
to Pay Off ihs
Legacies.
The Property Includes Some of the
Finest Tracts in ths Vast
Estate-
Mrs. Stanford is going to sell over a
half million dollars' worth of land. She
so decided last night and completed ar
rangements at once. The property will
be put on the market immediately. Mc-
Afee Bros., real estate agents, of 108
.Montgomery street, will make the sale.
The property consists of live ranches in
different parts of California. Altogether
there are 6SOO acres of land, much ol it
â¢ very fertile.
It will be extensively advertised, both
in the East and on this coast. The idea
is.to cell each ranch as a whole if possible.
> This property is part of the so-calied
"l.e!ana Stanford estate, which itself is
>pr>arate from the endowment of Stanford
University.
â¢The valuable and extensive Vina, Grid
ley, Palo Alto and other ranches, together
forming a total of 86.400 acres, have noth
ing to do with this sale. They cannot be
sold. They are forever the property of \
the upiversity, having been given to it by (
tenaior Stanford during his lifetime.
It will be remembered, however, that
Senator Stanford made provisions in his
will for twenty-seven legacies, amounting
to over $1,000,000. Some of the legatees
were relatives, others were friends of Sen
ator Stanford. Mrs. Stanford has been
paying money to tee different legatees as
fast aa it has been possible to realize from
the property.
This sale is primarily intended to raise
money to make further payments on the
legacies. It is also i<art of a general plan
to settle up Senator Stanford's personal
estate so that, all claims being paid, she
may turn over the balance to the univer
sity, for it was Senator Stanford'B wish
that the university should get even more
property than that with which he oripi
nally endowed it.
In addition to the3e fine ranches, valued
at over a half million dollars and now
offered for sale, Senator Stanford's estate
Includes over anali million dollars' worth
of other real estate in City lots and small
lanches and a half million dollars' worth
of stock in the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. This is all separate from Mrs.
Stanford's own property. After the pres
ent saie is consummated the other land
will eventually be put on the market.
It will thus be seen that after ail the
legacies shall have been paid, there will
be neany $1,C00,000 to turn over to the
university to sweil the munificent gift of
millions already bestowed.
Mrs. Stanford first contemplated this
Rale a month ago, and incidentally men
tioned it at that time. She said nothing
more about it, however, until last night,
when Mr. McAfee was summoned to her
residence on Nob Hill, and there the pre
parations were perfected.
The appraised value of the fine ranches
is slightly in excess of $500,000. The
agents hope to sell them for more than
that. '
The Copeland ranch, of 2000 acres, in
Tehama Cou nty, is one of the properties
to be converted into cash. It is appraised
at $100,000. It adjoins the Vina ranch,
ihat belongs to the university, and a large
part of it is river bottom Jand fronting on
the Sacramento River. The soil i 3 rich
and black. The land is covered with live
oaks, and is irrigated throughout with an
unlimited supply of water from Deer
Creek. The ranch was originally intended
for a line horse farm, similar to that at
Palo Alto. There are buildings and im
.provements on it that cost Senator Stan
ford $50.000â barns, sheds, stalls, race
tracks and other conveniences peculiar to
a first-class racehorse farm. The place is
planted to grain and alfalfa, and there is
an orchard. The railroad and the county
road cross the ranch. The Vina railroad
station is close by.
The Dr. Irwin ranch of 3000 acres, ten
miles from Martinez, in Contra Costa
County, is another of the farms offered
for sale. It is valued at over $00,000.
Formerly it was a part of the well-known
Government ranch, so callei. It is valley
land. The soil is a rich loam. At present
It is rented and is planted to grain. There
is some marsh land along near the bay
and that is used for grazing. This ranch
wiK be sold as one piece or in small hold
ings, as it has already been surveyed for
subdivisions.
The McCoppin ranch of 320 acres, two
miles from Ban Luis Obispo, will also be
It belonged to ex- Postmaster Mc-
Coppin of San Francisco. It is very fertile,
and. is particularly adapted to the erowtu
of grain, beans and vegetables. Some of
it last year yielded as much as twenty-five
eack3 of barley to the acre. It is situated
ne,ar the narrow-gauge railroad and
county road to Port Harford, and is close
to the San Luis ObisDO Racetrack. There
is a cottage and a few outbuildings on the
place.
The StiJlman ranch of 280 acrei, about a
mile from the center of the town of Red
lands, in San Bernardino County, is also
. for tale. It is in the midst of beautiful
orange groves on a sloping hillside over
looking San Bernardino, Highlands, Men
tone and other towns in the valley. Two
railroadsâ the Southern Pacific and the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe â run
within a block's distance of the place, and
county roads bound it on ali sides. Dr.
Stiiiman, an old-time Califorman, after
whom it was named, bought the place
twenty-five years ago.
He intended to make it a wine ranch
and to-day a large part of it is set to wine
grapes. There are also peach trees and
apricot trees. The original but little
Uied winery and brandy-still, together
with a small packing-house and a cottage,
.are all the buildings. Every square yard
of the land is under cultivation and it is
all rich, productive land, irrigated from
the Sunnyside ditch, one of the oldest
watercourses in that part of the country.
The land is especially adapted to oranges
and there are about 100 orange trees on
the place. It is supposed to be worth
over $30,000.
The last piece of property of the present
Jist contains 1200 acres of picturesque hill
tide land immediately back from and
DR. WENDTE SPEAKS IN DEFENSE OF DR. JORDAN.
Rev, Alfred Kummer, Pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal Church, Disagrees With
Stanford's President.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4, 1897.â Dr. C. W. Wendte came to the relief to-day of President Jordan and issued the following
open letter to the ministers who are criticising the Stanford professor:
The discussion evoked by recent utterances of President Jordan on revivals seems to one of your readers, at least, to be uncalled for.
President Jordan was addressing, without notes, a congregation of liberal thinkers lice himself. There was no intention of giving to the world
his utterances, much less to attack any local religious movement, of whose existence he was quite unaware. A reporter who was present
caught a flying expression from his lip*, and evidently no; correctly, as there are current two or three different versions of what he said. 'Even
as given in the newspapers his remark is far from being absolutely condemned by the orthodox clergy, the Rev. Dr. Dille, amoug others, agree
ing %rith President Jordan as to the irrational and demoralizing character of some revivals. Dr. Coyle's declaration that hÂ» never saw an ex
hibition of this kind is very mxpiistaf. Tne writer ha 6 witnessed the most disgusting displays of religious excitement and emotionalism, in
wnicli uot merely reason, but decency, were thrown to the winds, and this in the churches of leading denominations, North and South.
It is true a better, saner, more wholesome spirit prevails in the movements conducted by Mr. Moody, Mr. Munhall and others. But this
is mainly because of the growing ascendency of that reaion in religion which the university does so much to foster. The church might take
to heart St. Paul's terse comments on the fanatical excesses of the church of his day: "In the church I had rather speak five words H4th my
understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. Brethren, in understanding be not children, bÂ« men."
Jesus told us to worship God with all our heart and mind and soul and strength; that is, with our feelings, our reason, our daily service
and our moral and spiritual aspiraiions.
This balanced piety is the ideal to strive after. To attain it we need to cultivate, in moat of our churches, the rational part of our nature,
and toresiraln tne emotionalism to which Teligious people are so proae. Imagine Jesus of Nazareth conducting a modern revival. Compare
the more or lass sensational methods there employed to the heavenly calmness, the sober appeal, the spiritual instruction of the Sermon on
the Mount.
la any case do not let us be unjust to Professor Jordan by imputing to him sentiments and motives which he never entertained. And
especially do not let us condemn him for successive changes of opinion in religion, so long as these changes were all in onedirectionâ forward
into licht and freedom. ',
"When 1 was a child," said the great apostle, "I spake as a child, I understood as a child; but whea I became a man I put away childish
things."
The truth is. the great universities of our country, with few exceptions, stand for intellectual freedom; for the unfearing and nnre
strained application of the reason in all things philosophic and religious, as well ai scientific. This means that the current supernaturalism
is doomed, and that Christianity, divorced from credulity, miracle, emotional exess, traditionalism and creedal subscription, is to take the
place of the existing churches.
This transformation is going on with ever-Increasing power and speed. The recent utterances of Professors Howison, Hudson, Gayley,
Jordan aadLeConte arc only responsive echoes of the sentiments of President Harper. President Schumann, ex-President White, President
Eliot, President Low, Professor Brigf^, Lyman Abbott, Dean Farrar. Washington Gladden and scores of others still nominally in the orthodox
church, but in reality not of it. Truly, the religious freethinker can say to-day jubilantly with the reformer, Ulrich Ton Hutten, three centu
ries and more ago: "The sciences are studied, arts flourish, knowledge and true piety increaseâ it is a joy to live:" Chaeles W. Wendte.
REV. MR. KUMMER'S PLEA FOR REVIVALS.
As a minister of the Gospel, now engaged with my ministerial brothers in revival work, I have bÂ«en greatly surprised and
deeply grieved at the following statement which you made in your sermon on Â«'A Sober Mind" before the Unitarian Society of
Berkeley on last Sunduy, January 31: "Stimulants produce temporary insanity; whisky, cocaine and alcohol produce tempo
rary insanity; and so does a revival of religionâ one of those religious revivals in which men lose all their reason and self-con
trol. This is simply a form of drunkenness, no more worthy of respect than the drunkenness of the gutters."
This statement is not only historically false ana unscientific, but in extremely bad taste from one whois not a minister but a
scientist, and therefore, according to the "scientific method," not qualified to speak intelligently upon a purely spiritual method
of propagandism.
The charge you make against revivals is the same that the Pharisees made and which Peter refuted on the day of Pentecost.
That revival, as you must know if you are familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures, was not the first nor the laÂ«t. All along the line
of history from Pentecost through the first centuries; after the dark ages to Luther and Melancthon, the Renaissance, to Calvin
and the Wesleys, to Jonathan Edwards, on to Moody and a thousand other evangelists of these times, rrvivals have beon ap
proved of God for the spiritual and intellectual awakening of the world. I have seen Mr. Moody, B. Fay Mills and other great
revivalists, in ruass-meetings, put the test to ascertain what proportion of their great audiences of Christian people started in the
religious life through the influence of revivals, and the testimony has always been that an overwhelming majority were con
verted through the power of revivals. What will you, President Jordan, say to this undeniable fact?
You are the president of a college, and, therefore, you are supposed to have studied colleges in every possible relation.
You must, therefore, know that very few educational institution! have escaped the excitement which you decry with a mind that
is evidently far from "sober."
Allow me, learned sir, to recommend to yon a careful study of the educational tcbles furnished by Dr. Dorchester and
General Eaton. From these tables you may learn tnat of the 30.000 students who'are now pursuing regular college courses in this
country, almost one-half are Christian. At Amherst, William". Middlebury, lowa, Berea, and many denominational colleges and
universities, three out of every five students are Christian. Revivals are common in colleges; especially have they been so in
recent years. At Princeton, nearly all of the last thirty classes have experienced seasons of revival, and a few years ago over 100
were converted in a single term, and there was great excitement, still not as much as over a modern game of football. At Am
nerst, Williams, Dartmouth and other Eastern colleges revivals have been the rule rather than tne exception. And at Oberlin,
DePauw, the Northwestern University, and in many other Western colleges, revivals are frequent and powerful. Yale has had no
less than forty revivals, resulting In the conversion of at least 1500 souls. Dartmouth has had tenor twelve revivals, resulting in the
conversion of more than 300. These and similar statistics are easily accessible to any one who is in search of the truth, and he
who overlooks them or willfully perverts them may not hope to escape the criticism of better informed or more honest toilers in
the fields of culture. No, learned sir, you would be in better business and would much more please your patrons and the Chris
tian young people we send to you from our Christian homes, many of whom made their religious start in revivals, If you would
help these young people to warm up tbe icy atmosphere of Palo Alto, made icy by your skepticism and moral indifference, if, as
the noblest college presidents have done, you would foster a revival spirit rather than promulgate the skepticism, infidelity and
materialism of Voltaire, Colenso and Paine among thesojatuuents at Palo Alto.
But your remark is not only historically false, but it is unscientific and extremely ill advised. You are supposed to know
the meaning of words; the etymology of tne word "revival" is so easy that no profound Latin scholarship is necessary to see its
full import, and, therefore, you must know that every religious awakening has its analogy in nature, in art. in science, and in
every form of human learning; there are seasons of depression, "winters of discontent," to be followed by the blossoming
spring of an awakening, sunshine, fruitage and prosperityâ that has always been the order in nature, business and Providence,
or grace.
You insist upon the scientific method. You say that the utt*rances|of thelogians are of little or no value upon scientific
matters; tbey know nothing of scientific observation and classification ; tney may be graduates of Yale, or Cambridge, or Lelpsic
or Tubingen; they maylhave pursued faithfully and for years post-graduate courses; they may have taken the honors of their class,
but, according to your dictum, they must never dare to attack your materialistic vaporines, nor your science "falsely so called "
for, forsooth, they are not supposed to have the mental astuteness to understand these things; that is all plainly the spirit of
the president of Stanford University. Well, so mote it be. But, air, we ask you to take your own medicine; we want you to
abide by the scientific method. Wbaf, let me ask, do you know of revivals? How many have you ever attended? Were
you ever at the altar as a seeker of salvation? If you were and w<re sincere, in what estimation will you hold the man who
pours forth contempt upon that most sacred moment in your llfe?sÃut if not, with what authority can you speak upon a matter
to which you have never given your mind, much less your heart? Christianity, too, has its laboratories
Were you ever in the refining fire of a red-hot revival? Did you ever, in deep humiliation and prayer, apply the chemicals
and scalpel of rigid self-examination, consecration and the searching, cleansing power of God's spirit? To ask these questions is
to answer them. What right have you, then, according to your own scientific to denounce revivals, and speak of
"whisky," "cocaine" and the "gutters" in the same breath with a word which, to all God's true people, stands for the most
sacred memories, the purest aspirations, the most wholesome reform, and the most ra lical and lasting work of the spirit of God?
Your words are sacrilegious, born in spiritual blindness, and unworthy the "sober mind" of a common crossroads schoolteacher.
Your utterances and conduct as a Unitarian preacher have a still more serious bearing. We, as parents and patrons of your
school, have rights which, if you are a man, you must respect; if you will not respect them you simply prove yourself entirely
unworthy and unfit for the sacred interests reposed In your hands. We do not propose that you shall, without protest on our
part, make skeptics and infidels of our &ons and daughters. If you had the wisdom you ought to have, and a tithe of the "sober
mind" of which you so conceitedly boast, you would keep out of pulpits, and especially out of Unitarian pulpits. You are not a
preacher. In the humble judgment of many good people, you make lamentable failures whenever you attempt to preach for it
is evident you have no preparation for that sacred work.
You will allow a humble Methodist preacher ta apply your own scientific method when he asks you to stick to ichthyology,
conchology, seals and whales, for about these matters you are capable of instructing the public, but let others who have been spe
cially called, and vrho have given the best yeaÂ«a of their life in special preparation for their work, who have studied sacred history
and philosophy, and who have felt revival fires in their own personalities, let them preach the Gospel of the Son of God and bring
about the spiritual awakenings and missionary enterprises which makes trips to the Sandwich Islands and the seal countries pos
sible and safe for you, a student of fishes.
You will never be a true educator until you know something experimentally of the revival spirit. We make this statement
both as pnilosopby and history. This is what the editor of the Boston Journal says: It is a well-known fact that religion was
both the basis and motive of the establishment of the older colleges in the East, as well as of the newer institutions of the West
and South. Harvard was founded because of the dread of leaving an Illiterate ministry to the churches; Yale was
established for the nurture of a more rigid orthodoxy than that prevailing at Harvard and for the education of a ministry
for the New Haven colony. So of Princeton, Dartmouth. Bowdoin, Amherst and others. The religious idea waa prominent and
fundamental in their establishment; they were born in that Bpecies of excitement which you have the su
preme folly to condemn; the Western colleges are in a large number of instances, whether denomina
tional or not, the direct outgrowth of missionary movements and revival power. lowa College
was founded by the famous Andover Band and has always been an active agent in evaneellration. At Oberlin, in
its earlier years, a banner waved from the flagstaff bearing the inscription, "Holiness to the Lord," and a soirit of aggressive
piety has marked that institution in all the stages of its growth down to the present moment. At Harvard, in the earlier days
the students were required to rerjder the O d and New Testaments from their originals into the Latin, and many other religious'
studies and duties were imposed.
Allow me, now, in a final word, Professor Jordan, to remind you of a fact which you seem constantly to forget, that you
stand in a representative place and capacity; that even if in your secret thought you are a modern destructive critic, a materialis
tic evolutionist, a deapiser of evangelistic fervor, and a Unitarian, occupying Unitarian pulpits on the Lord's day, you do a stupid
thing and make a fatal blunder when you air your skepticism and disseminate your speculations and insult the Christian con
science of your best and most numerous patrons. The wisdom of the serpent should be combined with the harmlessness of the
dove, but the combination will never be made by one who possesses neither. You have yet to learn the patience, the humility
and the silence of the true scholar. If speech be silver, then, indeed, is silenca golden to men who occupy petitions so difficult to
fill and so delicate in all their various adjustments as a college presidency.
How many students would there be left at Palo Allo if every young lady and gentleman who has gone there from evangelic
ally Christian homes would pack up his trunk and leave your college? Will you seriously attempt to answer that question and
in the future endeavor to act with that equipoise, that judicial fairness, that "sober mind," which should characterize a college
president? Alfred Kttmmer, Pastor First M. E. Church, Oakland.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1897.
GONE AFTER SCHUBERT.
The Pay Which the Cashier
Received and the Rapid Life
He Lately Led.
Detective Boss Whitaker left yesterday
morning for Yuraa to bring back E. W.
Schubert, the defaulting cashier and
bookkeeper of the Rubs House, who was
arrested there on a telegraphic dispatch
from Captain Lees on Wednesday night.
It will cost $250 to bring Schubert here.
and that amount was yesterday banded
over in cash by Colonel Young, the pro
prietor of the Kuss.
This expense, with the amount of the
defalcation, which is $1200 of itself, will
have to be Dome by the American Surety
Company. This company bad a $2000
guarantee policy on Schubert, and any
sum inside this amount which he might
et from the Rusb House the company
vroaia be liable for. Schubert himself,
however, bad to pay for this policy, as is
the custom in such cases, and it cost $"5
for each yÂ»ar.
It is said that Bchubert has no re
sources, and if this be so and he cannot at
least render a quid pro quo in his dilem
ma, he will have to suffer the conse
quences of his misdoing. Some verbal
comment has been made that the salary
he received was not sufficient on which to
properly; tut Colonel Yoiing has a
different story to t 11 regarding this.
"He received $70 a month besides his
board and room, and bad an attendant
the same as any. of the guests to wait on
him," said the colonel. "He certainly
had money enough to meet all reasonable
expenses, to say the least. What he did
â¢with the money which he took from > the
hotel I do not know, but I believe from
what I hear that he has lately entered on
a career of fast living."
Schubert appears to have done a good
business in Denver during the lively times
there some years ago, when he bad charge
of the Oxford. When hard t mes after
ward came be seemed unable to live with
in bis income and fell into unfortunate
ways, which have resulted thus injuri

Professor R. A. F. Penrose, president o
the Pearce Gold Mining and Milling Com
pany, Pearce, Ariz., is in the City. Tbe
Pearce mine, in which he is a large
owner, has up to the present time been
developed by the use of horses and whims.
It is now the intention to pet a heavy
plant of machinery to place on the
mine. This will materially expedite the
gettinc out of ore.
"Up to the present time we have taken
out between 15,000 and 18,000 tons of min
eral,' 1 said Professor Penrose, "from a
depth of about 300 feet. Tbe time has ar
rived now when we need a good plant.
This means, of course, improved hoisting
machinery, cages, about 600 feet of tram
way for carrying the ore to the bins and
other apparatus.
"Beside this we will put on a large mill
for the successful treating of the ore.
Hitherto we have been shipping tbe
product of the mine to Pueblo. We load
the ore on tbe Southern Pacific cars at
Cocuise, a station fourteen miles from our
mine. We haul the ore there by wagon.
"About 100 tons a day is the output.
We ship nothing that does not go at least
$50 to the ton."
Profe&sor Penrose is of the chair of econo
mic geology and mining in the Chicago
University. He has been for several
years past interested in mining in Ari
zona. One of his partners is John Brock
man, the pioneer of New Mexico and Ari
zona, who was on General Howard's staff
in the Apacne campaign.
Professor Penrose will examine different
kinds of machinery while here. The
mine, which is fourteen miles from Bis
bee, will be well equipped.
THE BAKER MONUMENT.
The Petition From the Pioneers
for a $15,000 Statue Goes
to the Legislature
M.xican Veterans Join in the Request
to Honor Bakerâ A Belief That
the Bill Will Pass.
W. L. Duncan, one of the members of
the Society of California Pioneers, who
commanded a company under the elo
quent and brave Colonel E. D. Baser dur
ing the war, introduced resolutions at the
recent meeting of the Pioneers for a
$15,000 monument to Colonel Baker. The
resolutions were sent to Sacramento Wed
nesday, to be presented to the Legislature.
Mr. Duncan believes that the Legislature
will appropriate the amount desired for
the monument.
"The Veterans of the Mexican War,"
said Mr. Duncan, "have drafted similar
resolutions, and th?y went up to Sacra
mento this afternoon. Our resolutions
went to J. A. Waymire, who will present.
them. From all 1 can learn we will hava
a good show to get the $15,000. In all

California was doing something to com
memorate the brave deeds of Colonel
Baker.
"I commanded a company under Col
onel Baker, and am the only one I now
know who served similarly under him,
though there may be others. Colonel
Jerome of the Custom-house, who is a
nephew of Colonel Baker, believes the
money for the monument will be speedily
obtained."
The resolutions, which were offered oy
Mr. Duncan, seconded by Sum Halliday
and adopted by the Pioneers, and which
have now gone to the Legislature, are as
follows:

Pioneers, having heard that a bill is now

A DAY FOR LUTHERANS.
They Will Celebrate the Four Huu
dredth Anniversary of the Birth
of Mrlaucthou.
Tee following address to toe Lutherans
of the City has been issued :
Four hundred years aeo on Tuesday, Feb
ruary 16, Philip Melancthon was born and
twenty year* later became the poweriul and
indispensible ally of Lu.her and tne German
Reformation. In the evening of that day tne
Lutherans of every nationality in Sen fran
cisco and around the bay will unite iv com
memoration of his birth. The exercises will
be held In the First English Lutheran Church
on Geary street, near Gough. Addresses will
be delivered by prominent Lutheran clergy
men, among whom are Rev. Dr. Busbiiell of
Oakland, Revs. Â£. Icelander, Th.D., H.
Gen re We and C. Moenl of San Francisco and
others. The day is one of world-wide celeb
rity.
Wherever there are Lutherans, and especially
in German*-, the homd of Melancthon's
activities and of the Lutheran reformation,
i.uTo the four hundredth anniversary of
Melancthon's birth will be observed. No
pains are being spared to make this celebra
tion around San FrancUco Bay a real houor to
the man celebrated. The "Preceptor Ger
maniae" â the scholar of the reformationâ is
not a hollow tit c (riven to the associate and
colaborer with Lu'her, but one earned by him.
Even the twentieth century may learn irom
him, for it is a fact that never since his death
were his life and writing so generally and
carefully studied as nowâ the four hundredth
anniversary of bis birth. Six nationalities
will be represented in this celebration and
nearly all the Lutheran pastors will take part
in the services, special music will be fur

Me.ancthon was the writer of the Angs

PEfiKINS' KEPLY.
Hit Views on the Wisdom of thÂ« Ar
bitration Treaty.
In reply to a letter from Judge M.
Cooney resarding tue arbitration treaty,
Senator Perkins has sent the following: ..
United s-'tates Senate, \
Washington. D. C, Jan. 38. 1897. j
Hon. M. C'coney, Pkrlan Building, San Fran
cisco. CaLâblY Deab Judge: I tnauk you very
much fo your letter of Jauuary 21, relating to
the proposed arbitration treaty, for I find that
my mind has been traveling in exactly the
same path as your own, which has been edu
cat d to follow out the intricacies of law and
ascertain remote results. lam lri'e to bay that
I cannot, as yet, see that advantage can ba
gained by the Uuited States by this particular
treaty. It seems to me that through it we
should be in dansrer of having our affairs
inextricably entangled with thos_- of European
powers, so that every political disturbance
abroad would produce disturbance at home.
We have thus far been fortunateâ Ido not
think most of us recognize how fortunateâ in
being entirely free Irom European political
entanglements, and I should deem it a great
misfortune if we should ever be so connected
with European affairs as to btcome one of the
Dowers which are always on the verge of war
with each other.
I am in favor of arbitration of international
differences and of differences at home grow
ing out of the relations of labor and capital.
But I am of the opinion, as you are, that in
the former case an arbitration commission
can be formed to dispose of disputes which,
when settled, will leave us free of European
Influence as we have thus far bfcen.
While these are toe general grounds on
which I object to a treaty of this kind, I have
specific objjction^ on the score of the char
acter of the final arbitrator, who is, in my
opinion, bound to decide in favor ol England
in any case that might come before him.
Yours very truly, George C. Perkins.

NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. -The reduction In
the Bank of England discount rate from 3Vi to 3
per <ent Had comparatively little influence on the
markets for securities at, the opening to-day,
partly because Lnadon failed to respond
to the news. It was quite evident that
the action of the directors of the bank
bad been discounted, a reduction in the
bank rate having been foreshadowed by the de
clining quotations in the open market at London
for some days past. Stocks, after advancing i/ 8 <Â°
Â» 6 percent, soon developed weakness, and under
tel inij, chiefly tor the short account, almost the
entire list sustained losses varying from Vi to 1
per cent. The downward movement was tempor
arily checked by the unexpectedly favorable
showing made by the Chicago. Bnrlluston and
Quincy. Unas rumored yesterday and this morn
ing that the statement wou d show a decrease la
net earnings of about S20J.000; instead the
official figures reported an Increase as compared
with 1895 of $76,799 in net .earnings, and of
$69,630 in surplus.
On this shorts covered freely and Burlington
rose rapidly, Influencing other stocks. The im
provement was of short duration, however, and
during the afternoon the advance was Dot only
lost but In some Instancesâ mostly industrialsâ
losses were recorded. Sugar fell from 1165/ 8 to
114%- while Leather preferred declued to (>9i.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111,, Feb. The first trend of !
wheat to-day was downward, but toward the end j
of the hour the recovery of good New York clear- !
ances took place. The trade was of a very slow I
order, scalpers having the market to themselves
most of the time. The Cincinnati Price Current
summary was a trifle bullish on wheat, stating
that the recent freezing weather was assumed to
have caused som* damage. Receipts at Chicago
were fourteen cars, and 67.362 bushels were taken
from store. The northwest had 299 cars against
176 last Thursday ana 574 a year ago. Liverpool
cables were l@li^d lower. Reaction took place
! when it was learned that other seaport points had
I not kept in line with New York in the matter of
shipments, the total exports of wheat and flour
from Atlantic pores aggregating 33.329 bushels, of 1
which 196,248 bushes was from New York.
Cable reports showing a shottage in the French
crop started -'shorts" to covering, and a sharp
bulge resulted. Closing cables were lower. Hay
wheat opened from 74vs@74S/f,c, sold between
741/4 and 761/8". closing at /4 c. 3 /4 c higher. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 20 cars. No. 2 red,
spot, wheat ringed from 8.-!/4C to 8ol B e, closing
at 85V,,fe86V8 r "-
CORN â .'iterations in the price of corn were
very small, the business being of such slight vol
ume mat it was temarkable that quotations did
not remain perfectly stationary. Ttie strength or
weakness or wheat, however, exerted a slight in
fluence, o whicn the change* were due. Receipts
were 575 cars, ana 181, 18'J bushels were with- .
drawn from store. Liverpool cables were 1 i'l
lower. Exports were 446.887 bushels May corn
opened at 24c, sold at 241,4 c. closing at the "hater,
14c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts I
for to-morrow. 550 cars.
Oat There was very little difference either In
tone or character between oats and corn. Moder
ate fluctuations with narrow limits took place.
Receipts were 305 cars. There were no withdraw
als from store and exports were Insignificant.
May oÂ»ts closed a shade higher. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 280 cars.

UNION STOCKYARDS, in, Feb. 4. -The ex
tremely small supplies of cattle that are coming
on the market this week are Imparting strength to
prices, and good tat beeves are selling better than
for some time past. To-day's run was remarkably
small for a Thursday, being estimated at 6500
head as compared with Â«330 last Tnursday. The
sruallness of the supply made buyers ea-er to pur
chase. Prices were stronger to 10c higher or good
cattle and vaincs for dry-fed beeves averaged fuiiy
20c higher than at me co.ie of lust week. About
l:;O,OU'J hog* have l*en received so tar this week,
as compared with 3 15,650 tor the same time last
wetlf and 92,000 a year ago. The supply to-dÂ»v
however, showed a marked falling oft. Trade was
active and prices were stronger to 6c higher. Trade
in sheep and lambs was animated at firm prices.
The receipts ihls week are running a few thousand
behind last week and lait rear, but prices are ral

UNCLE'S BLOOD
Assessor Dalton and Mr.
Pelouze Do Not Extend
the Glad Hand.
The Ex-Supervisor Believes He
Was Deserted in His
Hour of Need.
Dalton Brings Pro<f That His Journey
Last October Saved a
Life.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 4- f
The color of a man's blood, which has
been determined by scientific research,
is playing an important part just now in
one of the prettiest though most bitter
fignts that has taken place in Alameda
Oqunty politics for many years.
Word was received from Sacramento to
day that W. S. Pelouze, ex-Supervisor
from West Oakland, was at the halls of
leglslat on doing all in his power to se-L
cure a reduction of the salary of his late
Assessor Dalton and Mr. Pelouze Are Friends No More, The Assessor Is Proving by His Uncle's
Blood That He Did His Duty, and the ex-Supervisor Is "Working at Sacramento to
Decrease His Late Friend's Salary.
warm friend and political supporter, As- t
sesSor Henry Dalton. For many years Mr. i
Pelouze sat in the Board of Supervisors,
arid mi hen Henry Dalton blush* d into
fame about Jour years ago in local politics j
he was really introduced to the giddy j
whirl of politicians by air. Pelouze.
The friendship deepened as it lasted, i
and last October, when Pelouze was pre- I
paring to succeed himself ac Suj>ervisor, j
Henry Dalton promised to give him all j
the aid in his power, and no doubt in
tended to do so. This was in a measure
due to Pelouze, who had deserted his old
camp two years previously to indorse the j
new regime that was inaugurated when
Dalton entered the County Assessor's I
office. Whenever an assessment came up j
before the Supervisors Pelouze's "aye"
â was-always heard in favor of sustaining
Dalton's figures.
All would have gone smoothly had not I
severe sickness come into Dalton's .amiiy I
fibput a month prior to the election. In
Ootober Dalton received a telegram re
quiring his immediate attendance at the
bedside of a dying uncle. While he was
away the election was held nnd Pelouze
wps relegated to the large army of unsuc
cek :'ul candidates.
Â« was a great surprise to me," said
jjftsessor Dalton to-day, "to learn that
Pelouze was opposing me, and his opposi
tion ia quite undeserved. I showed him
the telegram before I left, and while I was
away my father left his work for two
weeks and worted for Mr. Pelouze and the
result of his labors was shown in the fact
that in thp First Ward Mr. Polouze polled
50 per cent more votes than any other
candidate."
Now the fun has commenced and Mr.
Dalton is earnestly explaining that his
duty to a member of his family is superior
t.o "a political obligation. Mr. Dalton's
actions on behalf of his sick uncle saved
that gentleman's life and in this connec
tion Dr. E. H. Woolsey, a stanch Demo
crat, innocently figures in a keen Republi
can battle. Mr. Daltou brought his uncle
to Oakland and placed him in the care of
Dr. Woolsey. When he came here a scien
tific examination of his blood was made,
when it was discovered that it was so
much like water that it only contained 85
per cent oi its normal coloring.
Bo assiduous was Mr. Dalton to his uncle,
and so conscientious was the genial doc
tor, that at a recent examination of the i
uncle's blood it was found to be so near i
the rich, natural color that it contained 63
per cent of its normal redness. In a little !
â svhiie Mr. Dalton claims that pure car- !
mine.nuici will couise through his uncle's i
reins, ana that he will be a strong man, i
whereas but for Nephew Henry's prompt
actions he might have been an angel.
Kow, these facts would be humorous
were it not that they are serious matters,
ar*i Assessor Dalton Is showing his friend
Pi- V. oolsey's scientific figures in support
o-'r " claim that blood even two-thirds
bhft of par it thioker than waterâ even
political water. In the meantime Mr.
Pelouze is trying to induce the Legislature
to ccatt t about $Â«000 per year off his late
friend's salary, and everybody is wonder
ing what will happen before the curtain is
rung down.
MT. Pelouz*, long accustomed to office,
is rather anxious to be elected Council
man from the First Ward. He does not
say so, but it is reported that his friends
are pressing him into the fight, and this
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
in Oakland means the same thing. Ap
parently the City Repub'ican Committee
is rather in favor of Mr. Pelouze's a-pira
tion, for last night they declined to till
the vacancy on their municipal ticket
from the First Ward, although in receipt
of the resignation of the regular candi
date, Charles Henderson. Under tue cir
cumstances it would not be surprising if
Mr. Pelouze should be elected, although
he cannot at this time expect much sup
port from the County Assessor.
DAUGHTERS WILL RESIST.
William Hnlcorab's Children Will Op
pose the Claims of Sophia Mc-
Farland for Service*.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â The two
daughters of the late Wiliiam Holcomb
intend to resist to the bitter end the
alleged ciaini of Sophia McFarland lor
nur<inc their .atlier from November, 1870,
to November, IS'Jj.
M irb Lydia Holcomb says that there is
not a particle of foundation for the claim.
"When our mother died we were quite
young, and so long as we can remember
Sophia has been our housekeeper. Of
course, she was a good deal like a mother
to us, bui we always looked upon her
after we grew up as our housekeeper, and
1 think we shall have no difficulty in
proving that she received her salary every
month. Her complaint, 1 believe, asks for
$7500 due for nursing, boarding, lodging,
counseling, advising and taking care of
my father for twÂ»nty-five years. It is all
nonsense. Sophia did rnaso an excellent
housekeeper, and father pot a great deal
of confidence in her, but if she has done
all this, is it not just exactly what she was
kept in our house for?"
One of the most intimate friends of the
family stated last night that the matter is
easily explained. During the lifetime of
Mr. Holcomb, Sophia McFarland was
really the ruling spirit of the house, but
after his death the two daughters, who
are the executrices, concluded that they
were nble to manage affairs themselves, so
they discharged Sophia, took other apart
ments and rented their hou>e. The old
servant, feeling herself agsrieved, and no",
being remembered in the will, then
brought suit.
Mr. Holcomb was president of the San
Francisco Produce Exchange and one of
the most generous men in Oatland.
FAIR'S OIL-LAMPS TO GO
Th:y Have Been at the Narrow*
Gauge Mo:e Nearly a
Generation.
The Southern Pac.fic May Patronize
Alameda's Municipal Electric-
Light PlaDt
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â At last there
is some likelihood that the dim coal-oil
lamps that were plnced in the narrow
gauge depot by James G. Fair when he
built the narrow-gauge road, nearly a gen
eration ago, will be coon supplanted by
electric light.
For many years the thousands of people
who used trie narrow-gauge system have
been complaining of tlie dark, dismal ac
commodation at the pier. On windy
nights one half of the lights would be
blown out, and passengers coming from
the ferry-boats to the train easily imagined
they were in a dungeon.
This is soon to end. H. P. Foster, as
sistant manager of the Pacific system of
the Southern Pacific Company, has writ
ten to City Clerk Lamborn of Alnmeda,
asking for the lowest possible hgure for
which tne city will light the Alameda
mole. This application is regarded with
milch satisfaction by Aiamedans, as they
have recently completed the installation
of a municipal electric light plant of great
power, and are naturally anxious to ob
tain all trie business possible.
They are more than pleased at the pros
pect that their mole wiil be lighted and at
the same time that the city will derive a
benefit from the improvements in a finan
cial way as well as by an increase of com
fort.
The city of Alameda has made the fol
lowing offer: For ten arcs, 2000 candle
power each, $120 per month; for three
arcs and 25 candiepower incandescent,
$120; for 100 incandescents, 25 candle
power, $120; for the first cost of wirinu to
the mole, $450. It is stated that these fig
ures are lower than could be supplied by
any private company.
Another Liberty Tree.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â Detective
Shorey has a small tree which grew from
a walnut that was found on Washington's
grave. He has presented the tree to the
senior class of the high school, and they
will plant it with some ceremonies on
Washington's birthday.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, ISO 7.
A BRIDE SEEKS DEATH
Only Three Months Ago
She Was Married at
Los Gatos.
Without Warning Sha Drank
the Contents of a Vial
of Acid.
A' though Medical Aid Was Promp*,
It Is Not Uniikely That Sha
May Die.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 4.â Mrs. Fred
erick Kleupfer, a bride of only tbree
months, took an ounce and a half of car
bolic acid this morning. Her excruciat
ing cries attracted the attention of ber
sister-in-law, Mrs. William Tulley, who
was in an adjoining room, and she was
also heard by several pedestrians on the
streets. Dr. Sanders was at once sum
moned and applied the proper antidotes.
This morning Mrs. Tulley and Mrs.
Kleupfer took a walk upon Fark street for
the latter's benefit. At Riley's drugstore
Mrs. Kleupfcr bought a vial of carbolic
acid and the two returned to the latter s
rooms, 1513 Park street.
While Mrs. Tulley was busying herself
in an adjoining room the bride swallowed
; the entire contents of the vial. Her
screams as the violent pangs of the bnrn
ing acid began its deadly work, brought
her aid.
Dr. Sanders pronounces her case a most
; dangerous one and while he prevented
I immediate death it may be that the acid
I will yet prove fatal. Her critical condi
tion made it impossible for her to make a
statement and the relatives refuse to say
anything in her behalf. Her husband is
expected home to-night.
Yesterday Mr. Kleupfcr was summoned
I to Stockton by his uncle, Charles Kleupfer,
who was arrested for the killing of Charles
R. Dodge and Alexander Borland at New
I Hope, Stanislaus Conntv, Tuesday. He
is unaware of this last affliction.
He and Miss McCoy were married in Los
Gatos only three months ago.
Another Mmlcftl Organization.

OAKLAND BEFORE INDIA.
Mayor I>Â»Tle Will Not Comply With
Muycir Phelan's Requeit.
OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 4.â Mayor Davie
decided to-day not to comply with the
request of Mayor Phelan to help send
assistance of food and money to the
sufferers in India. Instead, he is devoting
his efforts to alleviating the suffering and
want in this city. Said he to-day:
I do not propose to ask the peoplo of Oakland
to geml moDuy away from home when there
is distress on every hand at home. We cannot
afford to send away a dollar.
1 have made arrangements with local real
estate men to secure several tracts of land at
very reasonable rati*, which will be tilled as
soon as the present stormy weather has tub
sided, und I think by March 1 we can tmve a
number of acres of land in first-class condition
I MvÂ« had many < flora of assistance in my
eeheme from mnny citizens of Oakland, and I
know that more offers will come. The assibi-
anee will be used in buying seed for the land.
The expenses not raised by donations of lib
eral citizeas will come out of the urgent ne
cessity fund.
Tills is simply tne beginning. Next year,
whoever is Mayor, will be able to do a great
deal more. More land ran be put in, a greater
number of people tan bo employed, more
products can be raised and the profits will be
greater.
The idea is to enable those interested to ele
vatn our ( \v:i people Mid PUt them ona plnn
above want. Tbere nre between sixty and
â event; prisoners in jail, ni.d tneir labor could
be used 10 prcni advantage. One acre of land
can support lome famiiv, and la some in
stances tiilf tin ten wou:d sufliue.
DUGAN MAKES COMPLAINT.
He Objects to the Suggestions of a
Berkeley Kditor.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â Daniel Dugan
has sued the Uazettv Publishing Company
of Berkeley for $50,C00 for alleged criminal
libel. Dugan's cornpiaint refers to an
article two weeks ago under the headline,
"Was Ha M ordered T" One paragraph of
the alleged li-jel contains â¢sough matter
for six dime novels. It is ai follows:
A strange case of disappearance, pregnant
with dark suggestions of a secret tragedy, is
that of Thomas P. Koark oi West Berkeley, for
whom a wife auU .six children have been
watching and waiting since September 23.
Roark was employed as a carpenter by D.
Dugan, wtio keeps h resort on Rose street, near
the main line railway track. It is a lonely
piece and the brooding wife or widow has
almost concluded that if the walls could speak
they would be able ta tell the fate of the lost
man.
On account of the presumption that he
might have killed and done away with
Thomas Roark, Mr. Dugan says he has
been damaged in tne amount named.
Asked Puckott to Free Her.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 4.â Stewart A.
Puckeit, whose troubles with a brother
Odd Feliow who stole the affections o! his

Lodge, will sue for a uivorce. He has re
ceived the following letter irom his wife:
Mr. Puckett: When 1 left you yesterday I
promised to see you once more, but 1 Had no
intention of ever beeing you again. 1 have
fully made up my mind that I shall never live
with you again under any consideration or see
you. The only iavor I a*.k of you Is to grant
me my freedom. As you know tnat we are not
suited to one another, it is best for you to go
your way and I miue. I will expect an answer
to this note as soon as possible by letter ouly.

Two Viewi of Salary-Cutting.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Feb. 4. â Assessor
Dalton and Sheriff White take differ
ent views of the matter of having their
salaries cat. Mr. Dalton says that if his
salary is fixed at a certain figure
there will be no limit to the amount of
deputies that an Assessor might employ,
and that the cost to the county would con
sequently be a great deal higher than it is
at present.
Sheriff White says: "I really have noth
ine to tay in regard to this question; the
Legislature can reduce my salary if it
wants to. Officials are the servants of the
people and if they decide we are petting
too much they have only to say so."
Annexationlats Organize.

oughly competent company at the Mac

Glen MacDonougu's play is full of rattling

HALF A THOUSAND
CASES REPORTED
Interesting Features in the
Annual Report of the
Children's Society.
>
Alameda County Must Be More
Generous If the Work Is
to Continue.
Most of the Funds Us^d Are Supplied
by the Parent Society Acos>
tie Bay.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, feb. 4. f
The annual report of the Alameda
County branch of the California Society of
Prevention of Cruelty to Children was
filed with the parent office to-day. Al
though it appears to be a mass of details
and figures there are several very impor
tant features connected with it.
In the first place, it is surprising to find
that tho county of Alameda contributes
less than two-fifths of tbe amount ex
pended, the balance coming from the head
office. This, it is thought, is a state of
affairs that ought not to exist, and will no
doubt be news to those who support the
society in this county.
It was partly this dependence on San
Francisco that caused a little rapture
some time ago between Charles P. Welch,
MRS. LYDIA A. PRESCOTT.
the secretary, and Mrs. Lydia Prescott,
the general superintendent for this county,
and which ended in increasing the scope
of Mrs. Prescott's jurisdiction.
The report shows that the welfare of 501
children was involved in last year's work,
and of this number more than one a day
was actually cared for. In addition to
t hi", 108 cases were investigated, 40 caÂ«es
were prosecuted and a vast number were
turned over to the various officials and
fraternal societies. The entire expense
was a little less than $50 a month, and the
figure includes rent, telephone, transporta
tion of children, and other small expendi
tures. Tiie total amount expended has
been, $574 90. Of this amount $150 has
been received from dues of members, $50
from the Oakland Exposition and the re
maining $374 90 from San Francisco.
The work has now approached a point
at which it is necessary to decide whether
it shall be continued or not. There i-< no
doubt that the county wants the work
supported, but as the labor of carrying it
on devolves on the local agent, Mrs. Pres
cott, it is very evident that she cannot at
tend to the duties of the work and also
look after the obtaining of subscriptions
trom members.
The report suggests that a systematic
effort be made to place the matter before
the public, as that is all that is necessary
to secure the needed support. During the
past year many notable cases bare been
attended to and maiiv little ones rescued
from ill treatment or worse, and the close
of the year was marked with a great in
crease in the number of applications for
help. The list of children placed in insti
tutions is but one branch of the work, but
it shows how varied and of how great a
scope ia the work accomplished by Mrs.
Prescott. During the year the following
number of children have been placed in
the institutions named:
Bt. Joseph's Youtha' Directory 14, Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society l,Bolvatlon Army Home
(San Francisco) 4, Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum 2, St. Joseph's Infant Asylum 2, Pres
byterian Orphan Asylum (San Ka(ael) 9, Shel
tering Home (Oakland) 34, Magdalen Asylum

tory 5, orphanage (Beulah) 11, Ladles' Keliof
Society (Oakland) 14, Bishop A rmitage Church
Orphanage 2, West Oakland Home 14, Girls'
Training School 2.
Judge Gr9ene from the Superior bench,
Judge Wood from the Police Court, Dis
trict Attorney Snook and Prosecuting At
torney Melville have all had ample op
portunity to carefully observe the work of
the society, and there are on record many
of their testimonies to the value of the
labors of Mra. Prescott.
THE STORY 01 THE MATKA.
Professor Jordan Lectures Before the
Geographical Society of California.
Professor David Starr Jordan, president
of the Stanford University, delivered a
lecture entitled "The Story of the Matka"
before the Geographical Society of Califor
nia in Golden Gate Hall Wednesday even
ing.
The story of the matka, as told to Pro
fessor Jordan by a native woman in the
icy regions ol the north, is a pretty legend
of seal life, full of barDarous supersti
tions, and credits the fur-bearing animal
with almost understanding. Aiong the
threads of the legend are carried the un
learned savage?' belief of the origin of the
seal, it* life and the subsequent trouble
when its skin came to be considered an
article of value in civilized countries.
At the conclusion of the legend a num
ber of stereopticon views showing the fur
seal and its living grounds were thrown
up n a canvas on the stage and explained
by Prolessor Jordan.
The most Interesting views were those
of lue ujjuiinj; males' battlefields, coy

Professor Jordan explained that the
wholesale killing of these vicious males
during the past few years by fur-hunters
had proved a blessing in disguise. Tho
males in their battles inevitably kill
large numbers of pups, and their jealous
ra^e frequently prevents the increase of
the herds.
OLYMPIC ENTERTAINMENT
How Members Will Be Amused During
the Months of February and
March.
The Olympic Club directors met last
evening and decided upon giving the fol
lowing programme of entertainments for
the pleasure of its members: On theeven
ing of the 17th inst., which will be ladies'
night, a grand series of atnletic feats will
follow a burlesque by club members on
"The MiKado." On the 26th the cham
pionship handball tournament will com
mence.
It was intended to hold a series of box
ing contests on the evening of March 17,
but as many of trie members of the club
propose to witness the Corbett and Fitz
siminons light on that day the Olympic
contests will doubtless be poatponed to
some future date.
George Newball, the club's president, is
now figuring upon encaging a special
Pullman car, in which club members will
journey to the battle ground in royal
style.
A bowling tournament will commence
on the evening of March 21.
The ciub has made special arrangements
with P. Waverly Shipman of Toronto,
Canada, by which the famous Misses
Webling of London, England, will ap
pear at the club in their specialties.
The gymnasium of tbe club will be ar
ranged in such a manner as to accommo
date n large gathering of people on the
evening of >iarch 2, whon tbe Misses
Weblings will perform.
MOD JESKA PLAYS SCRIBE
The Polish Actress Revives the
P.ay That First Won
Her Fame.
A "Standing Room Only " Sign Shows
How Her Work Is Appre
ciated-
All through the Modjeska season the
public has shown itself quick to respond
to those roles in which the star especially
shines, and last night the one and only
performance of "Adrienne Lecouvrear"
brought out a "standing-room only"
house.
Modjeska's impersonation of the un
happy French actress was always consiJ
ered one of her best efforts. It is seven
years since she played it, bat her work
last uig.it showed that time has not
withered her delicate and finished con
ception of the role. From the time she
entered in the green-room scene till
Adrienne's death the Polish actress fas
cinated her audience.
As Michonnet George Osbourne had his
opportunity this season and he made use
of it in a way that won him frequent ap
plause. Uaworth was not in the cant, and
the hero's role was played by Lonergan,
who was not quite such a dashing, hand
some Marshal Saxe as his Earl of Leices
ter and his Macduff would nave led one to
expect. He performed the part with a
good deal of sincerity, howeyer, and added
to the success of the performance.
Sosso did not make the most of that
officious gossipmonger, the Abbe de
Chazeuil, and Landers Stevens lacked
dignity and repose as the Prinre de Bouil
lon. Mrs. Levick was fairly satisfactory
as the Princess de Bouillon and Miss
Joliiffe was quite at home as the actress of
the Comedie Francaise, Mils. Joubenot.
Miss Perkins as the Duchesse d'Aumont
might have been on better speaking terms
with her lines.
iÂ£ven if the minor. roles were not played
with the careful finish which would have
characterized them in a good French
company, Modjeska's exquisite im
personation of Adrienne would bare
covered a multitude of minor sins, and,
considering that Scribe's play was re
hearsed lor one representation only, the
whole performance was a remarkably
creditable one to all concerned.
To-nicht and at the Saturday matinee
"Mary Stuart" will be the bill, and "Mac
beth" will be played to-morrow night.

NEARLY RAN ON A
WRECKED BRIDGE
A Catastrophe Narrowly
Averted on the Laundry
Farm Road.
The Rainstorm Caused the Creek
to Undermine an Embank
ment.
Passengers Sav<d by the T.mely
Warning of Iwo Men Who
Made the Discovery.
Oakland Office Saw Fbancisco Call,*
908 Broadway, Feb. 4. J
Two men by giving a timely warning
prevented a heavy electric-car of the
Laundry Farm road from going over an
embankment into an overflowing creek
during to- night's rainstorm.
The place where the accident occurred
is near Talcotts dairy, between Fruitvale
and Leona. There is a creek passes under
the track and a trestle and embankment
are built to carry the track.
In summer the creeK is dry, but in win
ter it is turned into a raging torrent and
sometimes carries along with it hundreds
of torn of earth. The heavy rains of the
past week have swollen the creek, but no
damage was done till to-night. This
evening the creek overflowed with the
velocity of a freshet and made serious in
roads in the embankment. The earth was
washed away and the trestle was endau
gered.
Between the hours of 7 and 8 the force
of the water undermined one side of tbe
trestle and some of the woodwork was dis
placed. If a car had run over it nothing
could have prevented it being hurled
down into tbe creek, which at that place
is about twenty feet in depth. The wash
out was discovered by two men, and,
knowing that an electric car was soon to
cross, they at once started oat to Inter
cept it They saw the powerful headlight
some distance away, but owing to the
rain and the darkness of the night it wal
not easy to attract the attention of the
motorman.
As the car was about to ran over the
trestle it was stopped, and an examina
tion soon convinced the conductor and
motorman that they had experienced a
very narrow escape. They saw that tbe
trestle was partly broken, and informed
the Dassengers that they could carry them
no further. Among the passengers was
Sergeant Ous Pollard of the Salvation
Army and a lady Salvationist who was re
turning from Beulab, and when they tip
toed their way across the wrecked trestle
they were somewhat alarmed to find that
even their slender weight caused the tim
bers to give.
The cars in use on the Laundry Farm
road are the heaviest in use on any road
in this county, and bad the 7:45 car run
any nearer the trestle nothing could bave
saved a fearful catastrophe.
The night receiver at the power-nous*
said at 10 o'clock that the embank
ment was washed out, and that there
would be no more travel till the trestle waa
repaired.
PROM WORK TO DEATH.
Walter Harris Fall* From a Steamer's
Deck and It Drowned.
Walter Harris, a shipbuilder's appren
tice, 14 years of age, son of A. Harris, who
resides at 2913 Twenty-third street, fell
into the bay from the deck of the steam
ship HeiJen, now under course of con
struction at the Union Iron Works,
Wednesday morning, and was drowned.
The boy disappeared at 8 o'clock, but the
foreman thinking that he bad gone home
paid little attention to the fact.
Late in the evening the boy's parents
becumo anxious over the iad'a failure to
return home, and went to the iron works
to make inquiries.
A search of the premises was made, and
the boy's coat and lunchcan were found.
This led up to the belief that the boy had
been drowned.
Yesterday the bottom of the bay in the
vicinity of the Helien was dragged and
the body was brought to the surface at 4
p. m. The Coroner's office was notified
and Deputy Coroner Tyrrell removed the
body to the Morgne.
Just how the accident that resulted in
the lad's death occurred is unknown. It
is surmised, However, that he was walk
ing along the forward deck, tripped, Mi
overboard and was drowned.

PICKING WINNERS
AN UNCERTAINTY
Mud Seriously Interferes
With Four Calcu
lations.
â¦ ________
Loulou R and Summertime the
Only Winning Choices at
Ingleside.
Harold Lindsay Was a Surpriseâ Judg
Denny Let the Talent Down
v With a Thud.
There was no growling at languid rides,
CO complaints of jockeys pulling horses
and no grumbling at bad starts at Ingle-
Bide yesterday, The sport was indeed a
lottery in every sense of the word. The
money was laid down on the chances of
this or that horse in the rin?, the starters
wended their way to the post, the sound
of pattering noofs splashing through the
slushy going was discernible through the
heavy fog and drizzling rain and then
the crowd awaited results. Not until
nearly opposite the saddling paddock was
it possible to tell wh;ch horse w:s leailinp,
Two winning first choices out of six prives
an impression of tiie uncertainty of rac
ing iv mud and rain.
With all of tnese unavoidable draw
backs, the attendance was good and the
twemy-one pencilers that weiched in
found no scarcity of coin in the market.
Tom Griffin popped another one of his
curious bonbons in the openinc six and a
half furlong sprint, dropping llarold
Lindsay down at odds of â¢; and 7. Jack
o' Lantern was played from 7 to 5 down to
even-money favoritism, and after getting
away from the post under full sail de
lighted nis adherents by finishing lifth.
Harold Lindsay came out of the logbank
rirst and downed Tulare, a 20 to 1 shot,
two lengths with ease. In a drive Jazjbel
go' the sbow from Cogent by a short uead.
The nve-furiong scramble, with a field
of ten starters, that followed, was a g.ft
for the 2 to 1 favorite, Loulou R, wnich,
piloted by Sam Doggeit, won as she
liked from Mercutio, a 4U to 1 shot. Sugar
foot was a close ti.ird.
McNaughton and Muir thought their
black colt Judge Denny a "moral" for the
third event at seven furlongs, and advised
all of their friends to get aboard, .-even
to five was always obtainable about The
Juikfe, and although the going was just to
his liking fie provei unequal to the occa
sion. Mobala:-ka, the second choice,
ridden by Sloan, won in a canter from the
100 io 1 sbot Boreas, which beat the first
choice a len^-u.
The wise ones were again sadly at sea
over the result of the next race, a six
furiong SDrint, with a held of but live
itoing over to the barrier. Pat Dunne's
Salvable carried all ol the Dig coin at odds
of 6 to 5 and even money, and his backers
i ad the intinite pleasure of seeing L-icky
Dog win from tLe favorite hands down.
"The Dog" opened at odds of 2% to 1, and
6wasatpne time obtainable. Fly made
the running the first part of it, but died
away to nothing.
Three heads on the wire marked the
finish of the fifth race over seven lurlongs.
Alone Fonse, Frank X and Babe Murphy
locked horns the last lurlong and crossed
the lne in that order. The winner, a6 10
1 chance in the betting, was piloted by
the crack Western jockey. Charley Thorpe.
The last event on the card was a mile
run, and Summertime, with but 104
pounds up, looked a legitimate 1 io3
chance. However, she oj ened at Ito2 in
the ring, and at call even money was laid
against her. She won in a common gal
lop, with the second choice, George
Palmer, rinisnine in the place.
NOTES.
It is said that Tom Griffin desired to put
Charley ThorDe up on Harold Lindsay,
but tne judges were of the opinion mat if
Barnnger was sufficiently experienced to
ride for the public's money he was good
enough to pilot the way for Griffin's coin.

flas-wielder, arrived from New Orleans

At the outlaw Iron Hill track on Janu

reappearance, after a long retirement on
the Morris ranch in Texas, and was the
medium of a "killing." After opening a

during his warming-up gallop, and his
price dropped back to 6to 1. The books
were then besieged with coin. The
distance was four and a half furlongs, and
he won in a gallop. Tne one-time record

THEY'RE FOR
CUBA LIBRE
Members of the Grand
Army Speak Out in the
Cause of Freedom.
THIS COUNTRY SHOULD
LEND SUPPORT.
Department Ccmmander Mastel
lar Would Serve on the
Committee.
ASSISTANT ADJUTANT - GIN
ERAL WOULD, TOO.
Others Suggested for Consideration by
Mayor Fhelan as Material for the
Lccal Branch of the L ague
Department Commander of the Grand
Army T. C. Mastellar is in full sympathy
with the movement to establish in this
City a branch of the Cuban League of the
United States of America.
He says that among Americans there
can be but one sentiment in this matter
and that stands for Cuba Libre.
The department commander fei in the
City laÂ»t evening and attended the meet
ins of Lincoln Post at Native Sons' Hall.
He had heard of the action of the execu
tive committee of the Cnbr.n League at
New York in addressing Mayor Phelan on
ihe subject and expressed himself as quite
ready to lend what assistance he couid in
the matter.
Assistant Adjutant-General Robinson
also spoke out without reservation on the
subject. He he wotild"*h *â¦ only lie
willing to suggest names for tf; commit
tee, but, the question being put to him,
said he would he willing to serve on such
committee himself. "I stand pat on that
question," he said. "I am in tavor of free
Cuba and would be glad to do what I
could on the lines of the Cuban League as
I understand iheni."
Mayor Phelan went to Sacramento yes
terday and therefore took no action in the
Cuban League matter. The expected let
ter from the secretary oi the league ar
rived in the morning's mail. The letter
is brief and businesslike. It reads as fol
lows:
The Cuban League of the United States of
America. Colonel Eihan Allen, president,
115 Broadway. Charles H. Deuison Esq.,
treasurer, Potter building, 38 Pfirk Row,
New YurK. Fmutis Wayland Ulen Esq.,
secretary.
New York City. Jan. 22, 1897.
Hon. James I>. Phelan. San Francisco, CV .â
Dear Sib: Will you kindly send us from
among your prominent citizms the names for
a commif.ee of such number an yon may
think best to organize in your city a branch of
the Cuban League of the United btates? In
naming them, please put first ou the list the
name oi the person you suggest bs chairman,
and last an active, earnest young man for
secretary.
We also Inclose you the address and resolu
tions adopted at a public meeting in mis city.
Very truiy yours, FRAXCTI W. (Jlf.n.
Before leaving the Mayor said lip would
select these names very carefully and
would probably seek the advice of others,
especially those who had been active in
the cause, in order to be certain of secur
ing the proper material. He will there
fore probably not reply to the letter for
some days.
In speaking of the matter last evening
Commander Mastellar said :
"I am in iavor of rendering: all the sup
port to the Cuban patriots thai may be
prop-rly done. I have a prejudice aeainst
takine up arms, to be sure, but I believe
that all the weight of moral .support that
could be (riven by th:s country should be
civen. I believe the members of the
Grand Army wili be found to feel the same
way from one end of it to the other.
There are many men prominent in affuirs
generally, as well as in the Grand Arm}',
whom I mi. .'lit name who would give
strength to such a committee.
"Who are they ? Well, there ia Colonel
C. Mason Kinne and Charles E. Wilson
and J. C. Currier and J .hn Whiteside and
J. G. Gicsting and Major W. B. Hooper of
ihe Occidental Hotel and General T. H.
Goodman and Colonel A. D. Cutler and
George H. Robinson and Sol Conen and
Colonel George Stone, president of the
Union Leasue Club, andâ well, many
others. To be sure, I have not consulted
any of these men, but I believe they are
all prompted by the same l'eelings as my
self. I sympathize heartily with the Cu
bans in their struggle, and believe that the
moral support of this Government should
be given them in their right for freedom."
Assistant Adjutant-General Robinson
was also at the meeting of Lincoln Post.
Spoken to about the matter he said
frankly: "I would, of" course, be willing
to serve on a committee to form a branch
of the Cuban League in this City. lam
heartily in sympathy with the Cubans in
their struggle. Yes, you may say that I
stand pai on that proposition."
This voiced the sentiment of all the old
aoldiers snoken to at the poÂ«t meeting.
JUNIOR ORDER DAY.
Programme of the Celebration to Be
Held In Xhii City on the Evening
of the 2Â«d.
The committee of arrangements having
charee of the celebration of the Junior
Order of American Mechanics' day, which
falls on the anniversary of Washington's
birthday, held a meeting in Shiels build
ing last Wednesday night, and John
Klien, chairman, and Calvin Ewing re
ceived the reports of the several sub-com
mittees. These show an unusual enthu
siasm in the work, and it is an evidence
that the celebration will be a memorable
one.
The Daughters of Liberty, who have
charge of the celebration to be held in this
City in the evening, reported good success
in the sale of tickets, and they declared
that all who attend the entertainment and
dance in Golden Gaie Hall will have an

BLACKMAIL-THE "EXAMINER" COAT OF ARMS.
MR. GOODMAN WILL
SEE ABOUT RATES
Not in a Hurry to Cut for
Men Who Will Go to
Nevada.
Looks Upon Talk of Thousands
From the East as a Sort
of "Jolly."
He Will Fmallv Decide Ab ut the
Rites for the Fight When Stiurt
Gets Here
Relative to the fixine of a rate from the
East and coast to the Corbett-Fitzsim
mons fight in Nevada General Passenger
Agent Goodman of the Southern Pacific
said yesterday that nothing would be
done until Stuart arrived here. Stuart
left Dallas on Wednesday for Carson.
He will be a day or two in Nevada and
then is expected to come direct to San
Francisco.
Mr. Goodman rather deprecated the
talk that had been made regarding the
great crowd alleged to be getting ready to
come from the East to witness the battle.
'â¢Some of these people have been send
ing us telegrams, making great claims
and wanting low rates," he said. "One
of these dispatches said 15,000 people
would come h re. Such talk is being
made by people who know nothing of the
conditions.
"I asked how these people were going
to jtet there. They can't all go in a day,
and they won't start three or four dnys
ahead. They'll say they haven't time to
take from business that way, and they
won't have.
"The fact is there won't be 5000 people,
let alone 15,000, who will come from the
East. How would even that many cet to
Reno or Carson in a day and be cared for?
All the hotels and restaurants couldn't
accommodate them. But besides the
Eastern people, look at those wno would
attend from different places In Nevada
and from here and otuer places on the
Pacific Coast."
Mr. Woodman intimated be did not be
lieve over 500 or 600 persons would come
from the East to see the battle. The bie
crowd he thought would be local and
irom the coast. Talking farther of the
rate from the East, he said:
"We have been thinking of giving our
regular round-trip rate, good for months,
or something like that. Holders could
come and see the comest and then come
on to the coast and stay as Jong as they
liked. The round-trip rate from Chicago,
good for that length of time, ib $110- How
ever, we shall see when Stuart sets nere
what we will do. We do not know yet
which town the fight will be held at nor
what it is intended to charge for tickets to
the fignt.
"When we know these details we can
figure more definitely. No, I don't think
the matter of the passenger rates will
come before the Transcontinental Asso
ciation. There is no meeting between this
and the fight, anyway."
Mr. Goodman was considerably amused
at the cartoon in The Call yesterday, re
pubiiahed from a l'itisburÂ« paper, nnd
representing the Eastern idea of the Ne
vada Legislature, and portraying the leg
islators heavily equipped with revolvers,
shotguns, boxing-gloves, and fierce mus
taches and long hair. He said it very
fairly represented the Eastern idea of
most of the Legislatures in the West,

Professor Lance Continued His Remarks
<>n Photography.
Last evening the California Camera
Club had its regular semi-monthly demon
stration. Professor O. V. Lange contin

order to give artistic effects in photog
raphy. The demonstration of ten days
ago was in the minds of the members and
the result was a very large and enthusias

The mountain itself was from one tie a

broken ana the foreground from another
negative was taken, while ttie clouds were
from still another, the whole producing a
very beautiful result.
A great number of prints were shown,
demonstrating the fact that with a little
practice even an amateur can eliminate
certain objects from the resulting print
and put others in their stead, in order to
produce effects not obtained in the origi

DEATH TO THE SEALS.
Expedition to Be Organized to
Go to the Farallon
Islands
Guns Will Pop, and After the Killing
Salmon Will Have a BetWr
Chance to Exist
There will be an expedition to the teal
rocks off the Farallon group of is ands
before long for the purpose of killing off
seals by the thousands. This plan is
eagerly advocated by Frank E. Booth,
who is engaged in the commission and
brokerage business at 1212 Davis street,
and also by J. P. Haller, manager of the
Sacramento River Packing Company.
These gentlemen are concerned in the
marketing of canned salmon, and they are
also interested , as a matter of public
spirit, in the extent of an industry which
brings in much money to California an
nually and ought to bring in a great deal
more.
But the great herds of seals which con
gregate at the Farallon seal rocks are
epicures, and are at the same time gifted
with weil nigh inÂ«utiab<e appetites. Air.\
Haller figures out that a seal will eat at
least 120 pounds of salmon per day if thnt
much is in reach, and the basis of fcis cal
culation la eminently practical.
"You will recollect the seal at Wood
ward's Gardens," said Mr. Haller. "I
ascertained by making inquiries, that
sixty pounds of fish was fed to that seal
daily, and then it seemed to be half
starved. It could easily have eaten twice
the quantity. Now there are thousands
of seals at the Faralion seal rocks. They
intercept the salmon as the fish run north
or run south, and pursue the fiÂ«h far up
the Sacramento River. It is difficult to
estimate the great loss caused by the -eals.
But for the hatcheries the salmon would
entirely disappear."
The plan for an expedition may take in
a tug, with riflemen on board, or may
take in tishine-boats, with arms on board.
The fishermen are very mucn in earnest
in the matter.

SWINDLED BY A
SMART DRUMMER
Victor S. Wolf of New York
Daalt in Worthless
Drafts.
Got His Friends to Indorse Them
and They Had to Pay the
Amounts.
He Is Wantel in Fresno, and Will
Have to Answer to Three Charges
m This City.
Victor S. NVolf, a traveling salesman
from New York, has apparently a long
term in the penitentiary staring him iv
i he f;ice.
Eleven years apo Wolf, while in this
City, made the acquaintance of Benjamin
Lewis, who is an attorney in the Mills
building. They became quite friendly,
and one Saturday afternoon, just before
the banks closed for the day, Wolf called
at Lewis' office and artced him as a favor
to indorse a draft for $150 on a New York
bank, as he wanted the money badly.
Lewis willingly did so, and the draft was
presented at the Bank of California and
paid. The draft was returned dishonored,
and Lewis swore out a warrant for Wolf's
arrest, but Wolf had lied.
Wolf returned to the City recently, as
L'jwis met him on the street on the
morning of the 26th of January. Lewis
hastened to Judge Joachimsen's court
and swore out a warrant for Wolf's arrest
on the charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses, but Wolf had taken alarm at
Lewis' recocnition of him and departed
in a hurry froci the City.
Belore he fled he succeeded in securing
Â£300 from two confiding friends. While
uere he hud taken his meals at the Occi
dental restaurant, 327 Bush street, where
he became friendly with Joseph Munier,
the proprietor, and Gustave Peltzer, a
wine-growers' agent, whose office is at 525
Front street, and he made bad use of their
friendship.
On January 2(5, after Lewis had recog
nized him, Wolf went to Peltzer's office
and told him he was in immediate need of
funds. He produced a draft on a New
York bank and asked Peltzer to indorse it
just as a matter of form. Peltzer, like
Lewis, was willing to oblige him, and
wrote his name on the back of the draft.
Wolf ttien called upon Munier and told
him tnat he was leaving the City for a
few days, and asked, as he owed a lew
dollars for meals, if Munier would indorse^
a draft lor $150 on a New York bank. He
said he could get it ca-hed and pay
Munier the small amounts he owed him.
Munier indorsed the draft, but he did not
bee Wolf again.
Both drafts were cashed at the Bank
of California and Peltzer and Munier
were considerably surprised when they
were notified a day or two ago by the Bank
of California that the drafts had been dis
honored.
Yesterday mornine a dispatch was pub
iishpii in the papers from Lus Angeles that
Wolf had been "arrested there on Wednes
day on v teleErum from Fresno, where be
was wanted for securing the indorsement
of a Fresno liquor-dealer to a worthless
New York tlraft lor $100, and that he would
be taken to Fresno for trial.
Peltzer read the dispatch in the papers
and yesterday afternoon he swore to a
complaint in Judge Joachimsen's court for
Woli's arrest on the charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses. Munier wiil
also swear to a complaint to-day, and
when Wolfs preliminary examination is
concluded in Fre>no. he will be brought
here to answer to the three charges against
him.
A MATINEE MUSIOALE.
It Will Ke Given T n -Morrow In Corn-

GUN, OAR AND ROD.
l'iii\crÂ«ity Boat Club Will Have a
Regattaâ Encinal Gun Club
1: lection.
The rowing annex of the University of
California will hold a regatta on the 27th
inst., on Sessions Basin.. Alameda, and it
is said that the Alameda Boating Club
will follow the example in April. The
programme will consist of barge and skiff
races, and if the weather be favorable it
is expected that !<orue fast time will be
made, as some of the oarsmen are now in
good condition.
Professor Miebling of the Olympic Clnb
is figuring upon the holding of another
wrestling tournament in the near future.
He says that among his pupils there are
many clever wrestlers who will certainly
enter for the next contests.
The Olympic Gun Club is already pre
paring for the inaugural opening of the
season's trap-shooting. New traps, new
grounds and new men will be seen at the
opening shoot, which will be held shortly
alter the close of the season for the shoot
ing of game birds.
Tho Encinal Gun Club heid its first
meeting of the season at Birds Point, Ala
meda, last Monday evening. The follow
ing officers were elected for the ensuing
year: J. H. Walker, president; D. Pulsar,
vice-president; H. Dunshre, secretary; F.
Schultz, captain; J. H. Walker, H. Bet
ten, H. A. Hoyt, directors. The ciub
grounds at Binls Point are being hand
somely fitted up for tho season, and will
be in readiness for the openintr shoot,
which will be held on February 28. This
club was organized last year, and has in
thai, short time developed many good
shooters, two of the members having won
the novice medal last year. The club
starts out with twenty-two members, and
it is expected the roll will be greatly in
creaaeu during the season. The regular
club si.onts will be held on the second and
fourth Sundays of each month.
Intelligence from Sacramento states
that the Senate Committee on Forestry,
Fish and Game decided Wednesday to re
port to the Senate the Assembly bill hx
ing the close season for salmon and trout
without the proposed amendments. This
is a blow against closing the season for
catching trout until May 1.

night and signed the contracts for their
respective teams.
One and all reported great progress in
training, and staled that their respective
teams will have better men and be in
better condition on the- 27th than on any
previous occasion.
Quite a number of side bets were made
respecting the positions in vbicb par
ticular teams would finish in the tourna
ment, and from the enthusiasm displayed
throughout, the proceedings it is evident
that the men will give a good account or
themselves when the pistol is tired.
â¢ The teams represented were as fol'ows:
America, Captain Buckley; Ireland, Cap
tain James Hurdnedy ; Scotland, Captain
S. McGregor; Germany, Captain Schilling;

CALIFORNIANS IN
THE TRANSVAAL
What American Enterprise
Is Doing in South
Africa.
Mining Methods Revolutionized
by Natives of the Golden
State.
Martin Haurwitz, M.le. Trebelli's
Manager, Tells of Their Success
in the Dark Continent.
Martin Haurwitz of the great London
firm of concert managers, Vert & Haur
witz, is in this City, having recently come
from South Africa, where he met all or
nearly all the Callforniaus. who have done
so much toward the development of the
remarkable mineral resources of the
Transvaal.
Mr. Haurwitz is a keen observer and is
enthusiastic in his praises of the work
that Californians have done in the Dark
Continent.
"American brains and enterprise," he
said at the Bohemian Club last evening,
"have revolutionized the mining industry
of South Africa.
"Previous to the advent of such en
engineers and experts as John H. Ham
mond and others the fate 01 the wonder
ful Transvaal was in the hands of English
army oiticers and others, who knew really
very little of praciicul mining, and the
country did not deve.op nearly as fast as
iis resources warranted. When the Amer
icans took hoid, However, there was a
c:ani:e. They introduced new methods
and ideas and the monthly output of the
mines about Johannesburg is now over
200,000 ounces per month or about $4,000,
--000. This is exclusive of the diamond,
ostrich leather, wool and otner industries,
that yield an enormous sum nionihly.
"Americans are gradually working into
all these lines and making their intelli
gence felt in all directions. South Africa
is deficient in the production of cereals,
machinery and other things that America
is noted for, and 1 understand that Cali
fornia is sending these products to Africa
iv larÂ£e quantities.
"It seems to me that a steamship line
between ban Francisco and Â£outh African
ports would pay well, and I marvel that it
has not already been established."
Mr. Haurwitz also spoke in the highest
terms of Herman Jennings, Charles Con
nor, Robert Williams, Thomas Main and
other Califormans wbo have cast their
fortunes iv the Transvaal and said that
all were doing wonders for the develop
i ment of the country.
The concert director comes to San Fran
cisco on a tour of the world as the man
ager of Mile. Antonette Trebelli, the
famous singer, who will appear at the
California Tneater on the 9th inst. Be
ginning an American toar in San Fran
cisco is an innovation, and in case success
attends ncr efforts the proteges of Vert &
Haurwitz will |in future start from San
Francisco.
