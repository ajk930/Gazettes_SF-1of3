"PACIFICATION" OF
THREE PROVINCES
Insurgents Disprove Wey
ler's Misstatements by
...-. Bold Operations.
Extensive Loss of Life Caused
by Blowing Up a Train With -
Dynamite.
Spanish Censors Fail to Entirely Sup
press All Details of Victories
' by the Cubans.
- KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 31.â Advices
from Havana say that in fiat contradiction
<: all rumors lately circulated that the
rebels are demoralized and weakened and
re.'dv to surrender, especially in Pinar del
Rio Province, where Weyler made the as
sertion that only 500 remained in strag
gling bands, word reached Havana Fri
day that the insurgents had dynamited a
train, causing great damage and loss of
life. Although the censor for stated rea
sons maintains the official pacification
and suppressed the information in the
papers, tne news has spread and all are
now familiar, with the details. The affair
created a great impression and was widely
commented upon.
Investigation disclosed the fact that on
the morning of the 28th, as a military
train wr.s crossing a culvert at a place
named Ocegnera, between Candelaria and
Mangos, tremendous dynamite explosions
occurred, ditching the train and tender. '
Tne armored car was completely wrecked j
and other cars were also more or less
damaged. The engineer, fireman and
thirteen soldiers were killed. The surgeon,
twenty soldiers, conductor and a brake
man were woundeJ.
Assistance was hurriedly sent and the
dead bodies were brought to Havana.
The wounded were brought toCalendelria.
The foregoing is not the only evidence
of rebel activity in that province. The
official reports daily announce numerous
encounters in different sections of the
country. In order to diminish the im
portance tbey are always reported as skir
mshes, with considerable rebel losses and
trifling on the Spanish side. When the
affair assumes undue proportion*, as Mel
guizo's recent defeat, the whole details
are suppressed.
Other advices from Pinar announce a <
change of leadership in the rebel force. j
Maria Rodriguez, after joss.' ally cross- i
ing the trocha with a strong body guard,
has assumed command, and Raft Rivera, :
who was designated to take charge of the |
Cuban forces in Havana province, man
aged to pass the celebrated line Friday
ano is near Mariel now at the head of the
in-urgents of this section.
Another striking illustration of the
Spanish misrepresentation is the assertion
that three western provinces are practi
cally pacified, which was given Friday
night, when late stragglers witnessed all
the eastern heavens illuminated as if
Guananacoa was on fire. That town ' is
not burnt yet. but reports the next day
stated that Aranguan had struck an
other bow in the vicinity of Havana,
sacking and burning the hamlets of Cruz,
fiedra 2nd Bacuranao, near Guanabacoa.
Wednesday last the rebels burnt most
of the town of Nueva Paz, in Havana
Province, despite the fact that the town is
protected by ten tor's, with a earrison of
300 men. All were taken by surprise
when they saw the rebels in the place.
AH the stores were looted and then
burned.

An Expedition Sent Out by Weyler
Ji'outed by Cubans.

Fordino Benedetto, the Firebug: Who Has Kept Petaluma in a State
of Alarm for Many Days.
The San Francisco Call
West special says: Another marine dis
a'ter to the Spaniards is reported. This
rime the Navy Department will be
charged with it, as one of General Wey
ler's river expeditions was badly used up.
Fifteen men are reported to have been
killed or missinc and the number of
wounded is put at seventy-five.
Hearing that the insurgents had forti
fied some heights near Paez on the river
(auno, Santa Clara province, Qeneral
Weyler sent Colonel Serves witn 300 men
in small boats to capture the place and
destroy the forts. After proceeding up
the river twenty miles on rounding a
sharp bend a heavy fire was opened on the
expedition with xifles and a 6- pound field
piece. Tne river was shallow and narrow,
the channel being near the bank where
the insurgents were.
Tbe fourtH shot from the cannon sank
one boat, and a moment later another
boat was sunn. The Spaniards leaped out
of their boats, waded to land and charged
the insurgents, who were protected by the
high banks and the thick bush. The Span
iards drove the insurgents off, but could
not capture the cannon. Resuming the
journey the expedition was harassed at
every bend in the river.
A lew, miles from Paez the Cubans
opened lire- with two cannon. Six boats
were quietly sunk and then the rebel
rifles played havoc witn ihe Spanish sol
diers as . they struggled in the water.
Four of the wounded were caught by alli
gators near shore and dragged under.
Colonel Serves was forced to order a
retreat which speedily became a rout.
Hastily the boats pulled back, but the
Cubans pursued, keeping up a constant
fire and sinking more boats.
Had not a reinforcement met the Span
iards ten miles from Cienfuegos not ten
men of the three hundred would have es
caped. General Weyler made no official
report of this matter.
SCHEME FOR REFORM.
Spain Ready to Put It in Operation
When Provinces Are I' iclfied.
LONDON, E**a., Jan. 31.â The Stand
ard's Madrid correspondent telegraphs
that Queen Regent Christina will on
Thursday next sign, at a meeting of the
Cabinet, the Prime Minister's' scheme of
reforms in the Spanish West Indies.
The scheme was devised after several
conferences with the leading Conservative
Senators and the Marquis de Apez Teguia,
the leader of tha Cuban Conservatives,
who is now in Madrid.
The reforms will go into operation in
Cuba as soon as the pacification of tho is
land will permit. The scheme will state
that the Government is willing to enter
tain suggestions as to West Indian tariff
reforms and the subsequent improvement
of commercial relations with the United
States. The whole matter will be han
dled cautiously.
The correspondent adds that it would be
premature to suppose that the scheme
will effect in Cuba autonomy similar to
that enjoyed by the Australian colonies
and tbe Dominion of Canada. . . ,

Blue Outlook for the. American Prisoners
in Cuba.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. I.â A special
dispatch to the Herald from Havana says:
Neither in official nor in mil tary centers
is there any information to the effect that
the American prisoners will soon be re
leased. Consul-General Lee is also igno
rant of such contemplated action on the
part of the Spanish authorities.
A prominent lumber merchant, Senor

HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 31.â The Gacatia
prints three decrees issued yesterday by
Captain-General Weyler from bis head
quarters at Las Cruces. These decrees
order the enforcement in the province of
Santa Clara of the provisions of his last
three previous decrees relative to the con
centration of the inhabitants, the sale of
goods and the establishment of zones of
cultivation as provided for in the provinces

CABINET WORK
FAR FROM DONE
Judge Goff Will Probably
Have to Decline a
Portfolio.
The Last Member May Not Be ;
Announced Before the In
auguration.
Diplomatic ani Consular Appoint
ments Will Not Be Considered
Before Apr.l.
* CANTON, Onto, Jan. 31.â With Major'
McKinley's inauguration but a little more
than four weeks distant there still re
mains a good deal of work to do in the
way of completing the Cabinet-
No word has been received from Judge
Goff, but the conviction grows that he
may find it impossible to accept a port
folio. In case ha does not go into the
Cabinet the whole question of Southern
representation in that body will be re
opened, and there will be another rush for
Canton on the part of delegations in the
interest of rival candidates. i&fl
There is no light to be had on the New
York situation to-day, and there is reason
to believe that the President-elect may
not choose the last member of his Cabinet
till he gets to Washington. It is also
likely that only one more of the Cabinet
appointments will be formally announced
before the list is sent to the Senate on the
sth day of March. The President-elect
has taken the public into his confidence
to a very considerable extent, and may
deem it wise to Keep his own council dur
ing the next two weeks. Most of the can
didates lor the positions of assistant sec
retaries will next follow in order.
It may be stated on excellent authority,
and no doubt the statement will be of in
terest, that applications for appointment
to the diplomatic and consular service will
not be considered till aftei April 1. This
will not of course apply to tho important
embassies, which will no doubt be tilled
shortly after the 4th of Match.
It is probable that the extra session of
Congress will consider and pass a bill pro
viding for the establishment of a Depart
ment of Commerce and Industry. It this
is done there will be another Cabinet offi
cer to appoint and a number of subordi
nate positions to fill. '
Members of Congress who have visited
Canton have talked a good deal about the
wisdom and necessity of creating another
department of the Government, and the
prevailing opinion is that it ought to be
done. It Is likely that some of the semi
detached bureaus now nominally under
the jurisdiction of the Treasury and Inte
rior departments would be transferred to
the new department."
Major McKinley has had unbroken quiet
to-day, and the rest was a welcome one, for
the last week was one of the most labori
ous he has spent since his election. Con
gressman James Wadsworth of New York
had a long Interview with Major McKinley
to-day.

PIERRE, S. D., Jan. 31.â The only
thing in the Senatorial situation is a coup
which is planned by the element from the
Black Hills whicn is here fighting Plow
man. Paragraph 35, article IV, provides
"that no Judge ot the Supreme Court or
Circuit Courts shall be elected to any
other than ' any judicial office or be
eligible thereto during the term for which
he was elected such Judse. All votes for
either of them during such term for any
elective office except that of Judge of the
Supreme Court, Circuit or County Court
given by the Legislature or people shall
be void." * '
Judge Plowman's opponents have pre
pared an open letter to the members of
the Legislature charging that in receiving
and recording votes for Plowman they are
violating their oaths of office.
DEPEW AS EMBASSADOR.

Court of St. James.
ALBANY, N. V.. Jan. 31.â The Argus
has a strong editorial favoring the ap
pointment of Chaiincey M." Depew ai Em-_
bassador to England. The concluding
paragraph reads: "Mr. Depew Is the very
beau ideal of an American diplomat, and
President McKinlev will not merely make
no mistake but will be fortunat* 1 if he se
cures the services of Chauncey M. Depew
as Embassador to Great Britain. In him
the whole country will feel that it has an
able and faithful representative, who will
be tho vigilant exponent and guardian of
American honor and American interests."

Is Discredited by the Young

BUTTR , Mont., Jan.' 31. â It is an
nounced here to-day that Frank Worthing,
the young English actor, and Miss
Blanche Bates, wbo during the past season
have been playing lovers' parts in the
Frawley company, which closed an en
gagement here last night, are engaged,
and tbat the marriage will take place soon
after the close of the season.
Mrs. Bates of tbe Alcazar stock company
and the mother of Miss Blanche Bates,

"I cannot imagine how the report

The Powerful New Cruiser Brooklyn, Which Is Reported to Have Been Badly Damaged by Ledges of
Ice While Steaming* Down the Delaware* Captain Francis A. Cook Commands the Vessel.
CRUISER BROOKLYN
BATTERED BY ICE
On the Way to the Cramps
Shipyard, When a Ledge
Was Struck.
Serious Damage to the Vessel I .
Reported, but t c Affair
Is Kept Quiet.
Two Pilots Unable to Prevent the
Warship From Swinging Out
of the Caanne . < â  -
- PHILADELPHIA, Pa.. ' Jan. ; 31â No
details of the damage done to the new
l United States cruiser Brooklyn, which
struck on a rocky ledge yesterday after
noon while proceeding . down the river to
a safe anchorage from the Ice behind the
Government piers at Marcus Hook, six
i teen miles below this city, could be learned
to-day. since the Brooklyn was put into
commission a few weeks ago she has been
lying at the League Island Navy-yard.
The ice has been running very heavy in
the river since tho recent cold spell and
i the Brooklyn : was in danger of damage to
! her propeller blades in the place where
j she was anchored. It was therefore de
j cided to move her to Cramp's shipyard,
' where she would be out of danger and
| where, at the same time, the opportunity
would be taken to fit a new safety valve
j on her engines.
The Brooklyn made an attempt to reach
I Cramp's yesterday morning, but the ice
I was too heavy to risk the ship in and she
was turned and headed down stream for
Marcus Hook.
The Brooklyn proceeded under her own
steam and had nearly reached her desti
nation when from some cause unknown
to the officers of the ship and the two
pilots in charge she swung out of the
channel and struck bow-on on a rocKy
formation on the ledge. The cruiser im
â  mediately swung back into the channel
: and got to the sought-for anchorage be
i hind the ice piers at Marcus Hook.
It is: reported that the damage to the
! ship is so serious that the water entered
i the compartments under the engine and
fire rooms. No .confirmation of tbis was
obtainable from any of the officers of the
vessel, but the cruiser appears to be down
at tbe bead, as if sbe had taken in water.
One of the officers of the ship admitted
that the vessel had struck on the ledge,
but beyond this would say nothing. No
one at League Island Navy -yard here
knew anything further of the damage
done to the Brooklyn than stated. If the
vessel has been seriously injured she will
probably be detained at League Island
and the usual court of inquiry will be
ordered by the Secretary of the Navy.
CAPTAIX COOK REPORTS.
Says the Compartments Underthe Engine
Are Filled With Water.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 31.â A Herald
i
special from Washington says: A dispatch
received by Secretary. Herbert from Cap
tain F. A. Cook, commanding the Brook
lyn, confirms the report of the accident
sustained by the cruiser in the Delaware
River. Captain Cook telegraphed to the
department from Linwood, Fa. His mes
sage reads:
Left League Island on account of Ice Jam.
Struck on Schooner Ledge. Double-bottom
compartments under engine and fire rooms
lull of water. Leaks in bilge, but kept clear
by pumping. Safely moored to ice pier.
It is thought that Secretary Herbert
will order a court of inquiry to investi
gate and obtain facts concerning the dam
age the vessel has suffered. No action
will be taken, however, until a full report
is received from Captain Cook.
Secretary H rbert considers Captain
Cook one of the most careful men in the
department, and desires to obtain lull
particulars from him. Ha regrets the ac
cident very much on account of his desire
to have the Brooklyn participate in the
blockade in the City of Charleston by the
Atlantic squadr >n. It is not thought
she will now be able to engage in it. She
has been ordered to return to League Isl
and Navy-yard as soon as the ice clears
away, and repairs will be made.
A Herald special from Philadelphia
says: Commodore Howell, commandant
of the League Island Navy-yard, had not
received at a late hour to-night any news
of the damage to the cruiser Brooklyn.
Admittance to the crippled cruiser was
refused to ati newspaper men. She is
moored to one ot the ice piers at Marcus
Ice House and does not appear to be in a
bad way.. Commodore Howell says the
vessel is under the control of her com
mander and out of his jurisdiction. She
was made ready for sea about two weeks
ago, but was detained in order that a
defective steam valve could be sent to the
Cramps yard for repairs.
It is thought that the floating ice cov
ered the buoys, so that the pilots who are
perfectly familiar with the location of the
ledge could not seep in the channel. Ordi
narily the rise of the tide is five leet, but,
as a result of the gale that has been blow
ing for several days, the rise was only
about four feet, and when the Brooklyn
reached there there was about twenty-seven
feet of water over the ledge. The cruiser
was drawing about twenty-six feet and
would have passed down in safety had she
not struck one of the blocks of granite to
wiiich the buoys are anchored.
' John J. Williams of Chester, a sub
marine diver, said he saw the Brooklyn
approach the ledge at a good ratecf speed,
followed by two tugs. He did not suspect
that she had struck, as she proceeded
down the river as though nothing unusual
had happened.
TWO DISASTROUS FIRES.
Seven Persons Burned to Death and
Thirty Families Made Homeless at
Hoboken, N. J.
HOBOKEN, N. J., Jan. 31.â This city
was visited by two disastrous tires be
tween .30 Saturday night and 3 o'clock
this morning. Seven persons were burned
to death and thirty lamilies were made
homeless.
The Saturday night fire started in the
three-story frame building at 41C Newark
street. Hers six persons lost their lives.
They were: Mrs. Nellie Schroeder, 40
years; Henry Schroeder, 11; Maggie
Schroeder, 7; Kate Schroeder, 9; Jonn
Schroeder, 3; Will Schroeder, 3 months.
The father of the lamily, Charles Schroe
der, was in a near by saloon playing cards
while his wife and children were dying.
The second tire started at 3 o'clock this
morning in the five-story double-deck
tenement at 157 Fourteenth street. In
this fire three tenements â 155, 157 and
159â were entirely wrecked and 153 was
damaged badly by water. Mable Mangles,
8 years old, was burned to death on the
lourth floor of 157.
The tire at 410 Newark street started in
a detective flue in Schaffer's wheelwright
shop, on the ground floor of a three-story
frame building. Scbaffer occupied the
second floor as living apartment.. The
front rooms on the third floor were occu
pied by Charles Schroeder and his family,
.while James Blanch field and family occu
pied the rear rooms. The Blanchiields
first discovered the fire, .which had gained
such headway that they" barely made their
escape by way of the roofs of adjoining
buildings.
, Alter the fire had been subdued little
save the shell remained. The police
finally reached the top floor, where,
stretched across tbe bed, blackened and
charred, lay Mrs. Schroder, and clasped
tightly in brer arms was the little baby,
Willie. In the same bed lay the charred
bodies of the girls, Maggie and Kate. It
is likely that they were suffocated in their
sleep. On the floor near the window lay
the body of the boy, John. Henry, the
oldest boy, was found under a mass of
debris in the hall, burned almost to a
crisp. It is believed that the boy was
aroused during the fire, and in bis efforts
to escape ran into the hall, wnere he was
overcome by tbe smoke.
The loss to the building and its contents
will probably not exceed $15,000.
The fire at 157 Fourteenth street, at 3
o'clock this morning, started from some
unknown cause. Ail the families were
forced out in their night clothing. The
family of Ferdinand Mangles occupied the
fourth floor. Mrs. Mangles and her four
children started for the street, which they
reached in safety with the. exception of
Mable, who was suff oca tea. The loss on
tne buildings 155, 157 and 159, which were
completely wrecked, is between s7s,ooo and
$80,000. Not over a half-dozen families in
the three buildings carried any insurance,
and their belongings were worth about
$10,000.

Pathetic Episode in the Life of
the Demented Dealer in
Incendiarism
Bacams a Vagrant When His Wife and '
Children Refused to Cross the
Sees to Join Him-
PETALUMA, Cal., Jan. 31.â alarm
and anxiety that ba3 given a nervous
tremor to this city during the past few
days has been displaced to-day by that
composure which is native here. When
it became known this morning through
The Call that Ferdino Benedetto, the
Italian now in the tanks, had confessed
to having started all the fires that have
threatened the destruction of the city re
cently and that his statement of detail,
coinciding exactly with the facts, could
not have been learned by him from any
other person, a ereat sigh of relief went
up all over the city. As a result, a great
many men who, rejoicing in recently ac
quired jobs as special watchmen, will, no
doubt, â  find their several occupations
gone. It will be some days, however, be
fort the effect of the widespread and well
founded alarm will wholly dio away.
Every striking of the hour by the big
alarm bell causes a slight palpitation of
the heart of all who hear it and the quick
return of that dread that has robbed people
of sleep lately.
Last night while people, still weary
from fighting the flames, were congratu
lating each other that the cause of their
trouble had beeu captured , and placed
where he could do no more harm, the fire
alarm rang out again. People hesitated
and looked at their watches, loth to be
lieve tiiat it was not striking the hour,
and then ran in the direction indicated.
The fire apparatus was out in a few min
utes, and the streets were alive with peo
ple convinced on tbe instant that l'eue
detto's confession amounted to nothing.
A defective flue caused this spasm. Tha
most mischief it did was in causing the
alarm to be struck, and when the little
blaze had been suppressed the faith in
Marshal Collins* capture was renewed.
.In their present 'temper people do not
readily accept the plea of insanity on be
half of the little Italian. True, his act is
that of an insane man, inasmuch as tha
burning of a big warehouse, a bridge, a
lumber-yard and a woolen-mill could not
possibly benefit him. The tearing up of
his blankets and throwing them away,
together with his shoes and hose, leaving
him barefooted on a stone floor in a dark
cell at the beginning of a winter's night
was not a sane thing to do. But people
say that that might have been good act
ing, and the fact that he did not profit by
the big blazes lie started may have been a
miscarriage of his plans.
If the woolen-mill and the bridge had
burned there might have been a panic, in
the midst of which he could have looted
private dwellings with impunity. Mar
shal Collins recalls the fact, too, that
when arrested Benedetto denied ail knowl
edge of tne crime, and adhered to his de
nial until old man Mezo asked him why
he did not speak when, running away
from the burning warehouses, Benedetto
met him on the bridge. Benedetto thought
he had been recognized ana so confessed
to the whole series of fires. The fact was
that Mezo, in the darkness, had not recog
nized Benedetto, but merely put the ques
tion as a test. Stronger suspicion was in
the Marshal's mind against an'entirely
different individual.
Having confessed, Benedetto became a
braggart. He is a little fellow, rather pre
possessing in both manner and appear
ance â not counting his clothes, which are
those of a laboring man. He has a round,

His eyes are dark and complexion"
swarthy, after the typo of his country

the fires, he shrugged his shoulders and
said he "liked to see tnem burn"'; he "felt
that way"; he would "light another if at

thing, as it would give men woik," and
he would "prefer to burn brick buildings'
for that reason, but the frame buildings
burned more easily." . ... -.â¢'â¢'
There is a touch of the pathetic in the
man's story. Through all his homeless
ness and night wanderings, his lying
beside the fire of engines in the yard to
keep warm and dry these winter nights,
his being ordered after a brief interval at
each refuge to find new quarters until
there were no new quarters, and it was in
the Marshal's mind to arrest him as
a vagrant â during all this period of dreari
ness, while he dozed in saloons during the
day and skulked about the (middy streets
and the railroad yards at night, avoiding
men and speaking only when he could
not avoid it, he has kept, neatly wrapped
in paper next his heart, the photographs
of his four children, who live with their
mother in distant Tuscany..
When Benedetto came to this country
some years ago it was with the purpose of
seeking fortune for bis family. He labored
as a section-hand on the road for months,*
saving bit by bit from bis small wages
until he had sufficient to pay the passage
of his wife and babies. He sent the sum to
bis wife and bade her come. After wait
ing fv*r months a letter came from Italy
saying his wife and chilaren would remain
".â¢â¢here they were.
About that time Benedetto fell sick.
They said he bad suffered a sunstroke
while at work on the road. At any rate, he
has never worked since, but has kept away
from men as much ss possible and taken
to skulking in the dark. Then he began
the lighting of ambitious and destructive
. fires.
Marshal Collins, while half the town was
engaged in trying to subdue the roaring
furnace at Whitney's warehouses, found
Benedetto sitting quietly before a stove in a
saloon in East Petaluma Saturday morn
ing drying his socks. Ha was placed in a
cell in the County prison and left alone.
At 10 o'clock that night the Marshal en
tered the dart corridor and almost ferl
over a lot of rubbish in iront of Bene
detto's cell.
He struck a light and found that the
prisoner had torn his blankets into shreds
and with every other portable thing that
bad been in the cell had thrust them
through the bars .-nd was himself stand
ing back in the shadow barefooted and
half dre-sed. Over the heap of rubbish
in front were scattered a number of small
pieces of white cardboard that had been
the photographs of his children.
"What did you do this for, Fordino?"
asked the marshal.
"I am now done with them," said the
man quietly, in his broken English.
CLOSES A TELEGRAPH OFFICE.
The Argentine Republic Punishes a DIS-
criminating I ompany.
BUENOS AYRES, Argentine, Jan. 31.â
The Western and Brazilian Telegraph
Company, an English concern which had
a monopoly of the telegraph communica
tion on the coast of Brazil until 1893, is
connected at the city of Buenos Ayres
with the lines of the River Plate Tele
graph Company of Montevideo. In order
to harass competition in the United States
and in Europe an overcharge of 57 cents
in gold per word beyond Buenos Ayres
has been imposed on telegrams sent by
way of Galveston to Brazil since 1832.
Representations to the different govern
ments concerned produced no effect until
last June, when this Government ordered
the River Piate Telegraph Company to
stop collecting the overcharge in Argen
tine territory. Protests and proposals for
an arrangement of the matter followed,
all tend. to elude the jurisdiction of
Argentine.
Last October the Argentine Government
gave the River Plate Telegraph Company
twenty- lour hours' notice to comply with
its decrees. The company replied", stating
that it had obeyed and always would
obey the orders of the Government. This
has since been found to be false, because
on the occasion of the reduction of rates
in January the overcharge on messages to
Brazil figured along with the new tariffs
submitted to the Government for approval
according to law.
The Government sent a representative
to the office of the River P. ate Telegraph
Company to prove tbat a violation of its
decrees was being insisted upon, and at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon the Govern
ment stopped the service heie of that
company because of insubordination.
Since then the River Plate Telegraph
Company ha** inquired of the Govern
ment en what terms the reopening' of its
offices would be permitted, and the
Government has replied that only on un
conditional surrender, without any re
serve, expressed or implied, will the com
pany be allowed to resume business.
This the company has failed to agree to,
and consequently its office here will re
main closed until such time as they B**,e ttt
to comply with the order of the Govern
ment to make their tariff uniform, charg
ing all the public alike and stopping the
discriminating rate heretofore imposed on
telegrams by way of Galveston.
The public service is being well attended
to by the "via Galveston" route.
A HVs BAND'S MOTEL REVEXGE.
Burns His Hotel and Cremates Himself
to Avoid Paying Alimony.
NASHOTA, Wis., Jan. 31.â 1n order to
keep his wife from ootaining alimony or
from receiving any considerable share of
his estate, Harry Haug, the well-known
proprietor of the Hotel Switzerland, yes
terday made preparations to cremate his
body by setting fire to his hotel and then
shot himself. Hang quarreled with his
wife a few weeks ago and the pair sepa
rated, the wife coming to this city and
taking preliminary steps to secure a di
vorce. This greatly exasperated Haug,
and his friends say that he at various
times threatened he would take his life,
but that he would leave nothing to his
wife.
Yesterday his hotel was discovered to
be on fire in three .places at the same
time, and before any assistance could be
obtained it was in ashes. Then it was
discovered the proprietor was missing. A
search was made for him, but he could
not be located. To-day the neighbors
searched the ruins and ound the charred
trunk of his body, minus all of its mem
bers, in a cistern which was in the base
ment of the hotel. Alongside of the body
was found Haug's revolvtr with one
chamber empty. The place was on fire
in three places in the upper story. Haug
then shot himself. The body was found
directly under his room. Haug was 49
years of age and was reported to be in
fairly good circumstances. The hotel was
valued at $5000 and was insured for $2000.

An Elaborate Propcsitioa for the
Creation of a Department of
Highways.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 31.â The
most radical step forward in the way of
legislation in the history of this State is
illustrated in Assembly bills 595 and 596,
Dy Ennis of Sacramento, and 597, by
Clarke of Alameda. No. 597 provides for
the creation of a Department of Highways
which is intended to build Slate high
ways for the benefit of tbe people of the
whole Stale. Three Highway Commis
sioners are to be appointed by the Gov
ernor, one from the northern, one from
the southern and one from the central
part of the State, not more than two of
whom shall -belong to tho same political
party. They shall each receive the sum
of $3000 per annum, the secretary $1800 per
annum, the clerk $1500 and the steno
grapher $1200. The term of office shall be
four year*, and the office shall be in the
Capitoi building. The bill says:
The Department of Highways shall take
possession in the name of the Stale, and as j
rapidly as the funds provided therefor will
permit, of all roads which have been or may
be declared State highways, and in cases
where the Legislature may define the general
direction aud route of a State highway, the
department shall definitely locate the same
upon the best grades and alignments, ana as
closely following the general lines defined by
the Legislature as the topography of the coun
try will permit, and in consonance with the
best , interests of the State; and wher
ever the location of an existing county
road, or any portion thereof, is such
that it may he properly defined as
a State highway, or a portion thereof, then the
location of such county road shall be utilized
for said State highway; provided, that all
highways included within the boundaries of \
the lands of State institutions, parks, or reser
vations now governed by bodies specified by
law. are hereby expressly excepted from the
jurisdiction of said department.
The Department of Highways shall have
charge of the locating, constructing and main
taining of ull State highways, aud to such
end Â«hall let all contracts, purchase all prop
erty or supplies and employ all assistance or I
labor, or incur otherexpenses incident thereto
and necessary therefor.
All work costing $500 or more must be
let to the lowest Didder after due adver
tisement. Tho department is empowered
to condemn she right of way.
The revenue for the work is raised by
bill 595, which provides for an annual ail !
valorem tax of 2">_j cents upon each $100 j
of the assessed value of the taxable prop- I
erty of the State to be paid into a separate
fund to be known as the State highway j
fund. This money is to be appropriated I
without reference to fiscal years for the !
construction and maintenance of high- '
ways. Not more than 5 per cent of this â¢
fund shall be expended in any one county j
of the Mate in any one fiscal year.
Bill 596 provides for the classification of
tho roads within the limits of the State as ;
lollows: First, State highways; second, ]
county thoroughfares; third, district
roads. The following are declared to be â â

OPPOSED BX LEGISLATORS.
Members of Boh Bouses 'Who Object to
Paying for Diseased Caws. .
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 31.'â Senator
Smith is one of the members of the Upper
House who is opposed to the dairy inspec
tion bill, which provides for the killing of
infected cattle and the payment therefor
by the State. He believes that the meas
ure as favored by the Committee on Agri
culture will not achieve the main object
of the billâ the eradication of bovine tu
berculosis.
"My position in this matter," he said
to-day, "is a little different from many of
the members, as both the counties which I
represent â Kern and San Luis Obispoâ are
very largely interested in the dairy busi
ness, and anything that would benefit the
dairy interests I would be bound to pro
mote. Dairying is the leading industry in
both counties.
"Up to the present time I have not re
ceived word from any of the dairymen of
my counties asking me to support this
measure. On the face of it I believe the
bill is not drawn as it should be.
"Admitting that tuberculosis is as
prevalent as some say, there is a doubt in
my mind that they are taking tbe right
course to stamp it out. Wo have a num
ber of excellent and very competent dairy
men in both counties, but I doubt that
they are skilled in the detection of dis
ease, and whether they would be capable
of examining herds and detecting this dis
ease. I question the advisability of put
ting the matter in the hands of tne dairy
men, as provided by thn bill. It seems
to me that it ought to go into the hands
of the county boards of health, who are
competent to conduct the work on a scien
tific and disinterested basis.
"I have been reading up on the matter
lately and I find that various authorities
differ very widely as to how dangerous
bovine tuberculosis is and what the treat
ment should be. Professor Alvord of the
National Dairy Bureau recently said in a
lecture before the California Dairymen's
Association that he --van ted to enter a
vigorous protest against this sudden on
slaught on the cow. He thought that
there was a disposition in several States to
act too precipitately in the matter and
that the disease would be better under
stood by waiting a reasonable time. His
idea is that it is not so dangerous as
people imagine it to be. He even went so
far as to say that cows affected by tuber
culosis could be safely used for breeding
purposes and that iheir milk could be
utilized if properly treatel by some
method of sterilization. He strongly
deprecated the proposition of killing all
cattle that showed symptoms of tuber
culosis.
"The idea of compensating people for
tbe death of an animal is decidedly
unique. If an animal is so badly diseased
as to be killed I don't understand how it
can have any commercial value tbat the
State should make good. The result of
compensating for such cattle would be
that California would go into the market
to buy and pay for all the cattle that
showed this disease and the expense bill
would soon run far beyond the proposed
appropriation."
Dr. D. F. Fox is the veterinary inspector
of the county of Sacramento and for the
past six months has been actively en
gaged in inspecting the dairies in and
about the city of Sacramento as the ap
pointee or the Board of Supervisors of this
county. During this time he has exam
ined about 500 animals and has con
demned and killed about fifty under the
power given him by tho sanitary laws of
the county. In no instance has compen
sation been made for such cattle.
In some cases resistance was attempted
to his carrying out his duties. But when
he explained that the owner of the con
demned cattle would either have to quietly
suffer tbe loss of his diseased stock or
take the alternative of being publicly ex
posed through legal proceedings as selling
milk from diseased cows all desire to op
pose bis operations ceased. In every case
a post mortem was held on the slain ani
mal and in no instance was the tuberculin
test found to have been at fault.
, Contract labor and the use of imported
materials on all public buildings is sought
to be prevented by Senate bill No. 500.
Foreign lumber is absolutely proscribed.
Its principal provisions follow:
All work done upon public buildings in this
State shall ne done under the supervision of a
superintendent or State officer, or officers hav
ing charge of the same, and all labor em ployed
on said buildings, whether skilled or "un
-Bhilled, rhall be employed by the day, and no
work upou any of said buildings shall bo done
by contract.
All public buildings which may be hereafter
constructed, repaired, refitted or refurnished
in this State, must be so constructed, refitted
or refurnished with material the native pro
duct of this State, if such material of suitable
quality and of sufficient quantity can be pro
cured In this State. This section shall apply
to the following materials: iron, slate, terra
cotta, marble, stone, cement and lumber; ex
cept where lumber of a suitable quality can
not be procured within the State, the "same
may be procured from any of the Pacific Coast
States or Territories. No lumber which is im
ported from any foreign country shall oe used
in the public buildings in this State.
Interior representatives are just now
greatly exercised over the question of
compensation to Justices of the Peace and
constables. The fee bill of 1895 put the
fees down to such a point, it is claimed,
that the Justices and constables in the
rural districts are not able to make
enough to justify them in holding the
positions.
"The question is bow much salary it
would be advisable to give these officers in
lieu of fees," said Senator Pedlar in dis
cussing the matter. "Nearly every mem
ber now here is wrestling with this ques
tion, not only in tbe Senate but in the
Assembly. The general provisions of the
county government bill provide that
t ere shall be only one Justice and one
constable in each township having a pop
ulation of less than 3000. The power of
dividing the townships is vested in the
Boards of Supervisors, and the practical
solution of tbis question seems to lie in
giving a fair salary to the officers Or in re
ducing the number of townships."

Arranging Special-Train Parties to the
Scene of the Fight.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. I.â From
present indications there will be a largo
delegation of New York sporting men at the
ringside in Nevada when Robert Fitzsim
mons and James J. Corbett battle for the
heavy-weight championship of the world
on March 17.
Already -'special train parties" are be
ing arranged and Al Smith predicts that
more New Yorkers will attend the con
test than ever left the metropolis on a
similar occasion before.
The pronounced enthusiasm among New-
Yorkers with regard to the big mill is due
to the certainty that both principals will
have absolute protection from the authori
ties, and that visitors to Nevada will
surely see a fight and be just as free to go
and come as the principals.
BETTIXG 0> iHE FIGHT.
Plenty of Corbett Money in Sight at
Odds of IO to 7.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Jan. 31â There
have been several large bets made on the
coming fight since its location was decided
upon. ' * . ~i.., i ;'i.*;j;~'
Some even money has been wagered,
but as a general rule Corbett is the favor
ite of the big bettors and his admirers are
compelled to lay odds ' in order to get
their money down.
The best wager on the battle recorded to
â¢late was made by Joe Vendig, who laid
$1000 even with a prominent wholesale
dry-cood3 merchant. Al Smith put up
$1000 to $700 with a noted physician at
Deinionico's on Thursday night.
There is plenty of Corbett money in
sight to wager at the prevailing odds of
10 to 7. It is said that A! Smith has been
commissioned to bet $40,000 at this price
while Johnny Kelley has a $5000 commis
sion from Bookmaker J. E. McDonald,
who sailed for England last Wednesday.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark,, Jan. 31. â In
response to a query asking his opinion of
the prize-fight law recently enacted by the
Nevada Legislature. Governor Jones last
night wired a New York paper as follows:
â¢'The new prize-fieht law of Nevada is, in
my judgment, exceedingly unwise. We
would not tolerate such a thing in
Arkansas. Our legislature now in session
is considering a bill to make prize-fighting
a felony." .

Warmly Received at All Points They
Visit in the South.
GALVESTON, Tex., Jan 31.â The Con
gressional Harbor Committee arrived to
night from Houston. They left Houston
this morning, coming down Buffalo
bayou on the big boat, inspecting the
water approaches to Houston with a view
to their improvement with appropriations
from the general appropriations. From
expre-sions dropped by various member
of the committee they will favor deepen
in*: the channel to Houston and establish
ing the point lowest the field of produc
tion. They also examined closely tne
harbor improvements, and were surprised
at the immensity of the work and the re
sults accomplished.
To-night the committee decided to go
to Velascq by rail instead of by sea, and
will leave at 8:30 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing. After inspecting tbe improvements
at the mouth of the Brazos river they will
return to Houston to-morrow evening and

and investigate Trinity River, with a view
to its improvement. The committee is
highly pleased at their hearty reception
at ail points visited by them in the South.

Treaties That May Cause Much

Â°
Loige Exposes the Attempt of a For
eign Corp ration to Defeat the
Immigration Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31.â Much
of the time of the Senate this week will
probably be spent behind closed doors.
The general treaty of arbitration between
the United States and Great Britain will
be reported to the Senate to-morrow as
amended by the committee Saturday. In
addition to this general treaty there are
also the trademark and copyright "treaty
with Japan and the convention providing
for the appointment of a commission to
determine the boundary line between
Alaska and the British possessions, which
will probabiy be sent to the Senate to
morrow.
These matters, to say nothing of the un
rest of the Democrats on account of the
holding up of the postoffice nominations
by the Postoffice Committee, will causa
more or less of executive debate. The
Nicaraguan canal bill, on which Morgan
was vainly endeavoring to secure a time
for a vote, still remains- the unfinished
business.
The bankruptcy bill was agreed upon to
follow this, but the two steering commit
tees have decided that the Hawaiian cable
bill shall be considered first. Bf_9B
The House will devote the coming wees
largely to the consideration of appropria
tion bills and election cases. The case of
George A. Cornett vs. Claude A. Swanson,
from the Fifth District of Virginia, is on
the calendar, and Thoma3 (R.) ot Michi
gan has given notice tbat he will call it up
for action on Wednesday. The diplomatic
and consular and District of Columbia ap
propriation bills are ready. Before the
week closes the postoffice and naval bills,
it is understood, may be presented.
Senator Lodge to-day said: "Since re
ceiving a copy of the telegrams which
Ciausenius & Co. â¢ were sending out to
affect votes on the immigration bill and
which I gave to the press, there has been
sent me a copy of the circular which this
same firm has been sending out through
the mail. As they stated in an interview
that they were sendin_- ont their tele
grams only in their individual capacity,
it will be interesting to observe that this
circular is addressed to agents, who I sup
pose were also to act in their individual
capacity and not as agents of the North
German Lloyd Steamship Company. The
circular in full is as follows:
Chicago, January 25, 1807. .
To Agents: Tbe immigration bill, which is
intended to materially restrict immigration,
comes up for final disposition in the House of
Representatives- in Washington, D. CL, on
Wednesday, the 27th inst. It is quite clear
that immigration will really De restricted al
most to the extent of total exclusion ot immi
grants should it become a law. and every effort
should therefore be made to insure the deieat
of the bill. You are indirectly Interested in
the defeat of the bill as much as we are, and
we would respcctlully ask you to wire your
Representative in Congress immediately on
receipt of this to vote against the bill, i;,iorm
iug him that the measure virtually means ex
clusion, and his vote in favor of the same wil
mean repudiation by his constituents and his
defeat at the next election. Trusting that you
will not fail to give this your prompt atten
tion, we are yours respectfully.
H. Clacsemcs & Co.
"Inclosed was a little red slip of type
as follows: 'Wire your representative
lully and let us know cost of telegram and
we will promptly refund amount to you.'
"I think it very desirable that the atten
tion of Congress, of the press and of the
public should be drawn to this attempt on
the part of the agents of a foreign corpora
tion to defeat a measure of ereat public
importance in which the people of the
United States are profoundly interested."

COHEN IN TA COMA'S JAIL
Added Notoriety for the Man Who De
serted His Betrothed at San Jose on
the Wedding Day.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 31.â After an ab
sence of two weeks Meyer Cohen has re
turned from British Columbia. The po
lice bad been loosing for him, and early
this morning Detective Ashby took him
into custody as he landed from the Vic
toria steamer at Seattle. â ' ' -
For several months Cohen has worked
for the Daily Ledger as collector. It is
alleged that he failed to account for
something less than $100, his arrest being
made on a warrant sworn out by the
Ledger charging larceny by embezzle
ment.
Cohen is about 27 years old, and accord
ing to stories in circulation here, is far
from being a model young man. lt is
claimed that several young women of
good familes are minus gold rings set with
jewels which they loaned to him upon the
assurance that he was very fond of wear
ing rings.
Although the police are reticent it is
known that tbey have located one dia
mond in a pawnshop and its fair owner
will probably nave to pay a considerable
sum to obtain it. A tailoring company
and the Hotel Ghilberg have fair-sized
bills which they hope in some manner to
collect, as tbeyunderstand that Cohen's
people in San Francisco are well-to-do.
In other towns also Cohen cultivated
the acquaintance of the fair sex. Cahfor
nians here state it was he who created a
sensation early last year by failing to ap
pear in San Jose on the day set for his
marriage to Miss Greenwood. Extensive
preparations had been made for the wed
ding and the bridegroom's non-appear
ance formed a basis lor several interesting
stories.
He came northward at that time, and,
after visiting other Northwestern towns,
landed in Tacoma about November 1. He
went to work lor the Ledger, and was also
assistant manager of the Ninth-street
Theater. â¢ -'>/,'- .*..â¢. ..,
About two weeks ago Cohen was re
ported missing. Tde police have since
kept trace of his wbereaoouts and reached
the conclusion that he would return this
way with the Grover Company.
It reports be true, he left an unpaid
board bill at Seattle, whence he went to
Victoria with the "'Dazzler" Company.
One of the "Dazzler" chorus girls is said
to have lost a ring, while the manager
cashed Cohen's order for $15 on the Ninth
street Theater here, and found later that
the tneater owed him nothing.
Cohen joined the Grovers at Vancouver
and assisted in billing them through Brit
ish Columbia. If he gets out of , his pres
ent difficulty he will remain with the com
pany. He is still in jail. His bail will be
fixed to-morrow.

missioned and sent to the Asiatic station.
A large force of men is engaged on the
boilers and machinery of the Baltimore

result being that many of the mechanics

the material has arrived rapid progress
will be made. ~ i

26. Kearny Street, San Francisco, Cal.NEW RULES FOR
ARMY DISCHARGES
Important Changes Contem
plated by the War De
partment.
A Simple Form to Be Used in
Describing the Record of
the Soldier.
General Craighill Will Retire To un
tarily To-Dayâ Colonel J M. Wil
son H s Successor.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jin. 31âIm
portant cnanges in army resti'ations rela
ting to discharges are un-ler consider
ation at the War Departme-t. The proba
bilities point to the issuance of new orders
on the subject in the early future. The
Assistant Secretary of War now has the
matter beforo him. He will soon submit
to Secretary Lamont recommendations as
to what changes in regulations should be
made, especially as to the kind and form
of discharges and manner of preparing
and issuing them. This work, under Gen
eral Doe's direction, is a new form of dis-
/ c\ .arge, and rules of guidance have been
"f. drawn up. These are at present receiving
* -fiat official's attention. â¢
1 The Assistant Secretary's proposition is
to have but one kind or form of discharge
hereafter. On the face of this it is to be
stated tnat the person named "is hereby
discharged from the army of the United
States."
The face of the discharge will not indi
cate the character of the man, but on the
back it will appear, both in a general way
and also in a special manner, upon what
the officer signing the discharge based his
conclusionâ that is, one line will be given
to the soldier's general merit mark. This
will be defined by the words "excellent,"
"good," "lair," "indifferent" and "bad."
Tuen will lollow lines upon which to give
information as to the soldier's proficiency
in military duties, sobriety and obedience,
to be similarly defined by words.
A similar system of making discharges
of sailors and marines is in force in the
naval service. Recently the board of
marine officers considering records of en
listed men in connection with the award
ing of good-conduct badges have found
that certain non-commissioned officers
and privates were given excellent char
acters, while tlie information concerning
their .proficiency in cleanliness, sobriety
and obedience averaged good or fair.
Another feature of the new proposition
is to have appeals in discharge cases set
tled in military departments where the
discharges are granted. Tne plan provides
for doing away with character boards.
Each company commander is to put on a
soldier's discharge the marks which he
thinks he is entitled to, also his general
standing of efficiency. It will not be neces
sary to inform the soldier what tbese
marks are, but if the captain decides that I
the man's service has not been nonest and j
faithful he must notity him of the fact.
Then the soldier may appeal to the post i
commander, who will oint a board to
consider the case. If the board sustains
the captain the case is dropped. Whether
it approves or disapproves the case next
goes to the post commander. His action
is final if he agrees with the board. If he
proves the case is forwarded to the
department commander. No appeal to
the War Department is now proposed,
although this point has not been definitely
settled.
General William P. Craighill, chief of en
gineers of the army, will voluntarily re
tire from active service on Monday next.
It appear? that General Cr->.ighill has a
strong prejudice against being retired for
age.' .To his friends he has said that ne is
.good for ucU more hard work; that he
is desirous of obtaining suitable employ
ment in civil life, and that his chances of
securing an acceptable position might be
impaired should his record show that he
had quit the active list on account of ace.
The Call corresrondent learns that t.e
President has decided to name Colonel
John M. Wilson, in charge of public
buildings and grounds in the District of
Columbia, as General Craigbill'a successor. j
Colonel Wilson is an officer of marked
ability. He was an ideal superintendent
of the military academy. His manage
ment of Washington public buildings and I
grounds shows him to be an officer of fine
executive ability. â¢ |
BOLT TRUST COLLAPSED.
Prices Fall Twenty Per Cent Within the
Lust Three Days.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 31.â A morning
paper says: The bolt trust nas collapsed,
and prices have fallen 20 per cent Within
the last three days. The market is still
demoralized with values uncertain and ir
/ regular, and there are prospects of still
k" '* i.er declines next week. The bolt
..nil ust included in its control the manufac
turers of machine and carriage bolts and
the puts and lag screws. It was formed
shortly aft. the nail trust, and 3. 11.
Parks of Boston, as "conimissi**per,"
drew a subsidy of 5 cents a keg on the en
tire output of the manufacturers as long
as prices were maintained. Though the
combination advanced prices 60 per cent
it aid not go tothe extortionate lengths
of its sister organization, and for that rea
son has lived longer.
The shovel trust, which was formed
' about the time of the bolt agreement, is
" still working satisfactorily. Prices are 50
to 100 per cent higher than before the,
cement was formed, but it is generally
â¢ conceded that the shovel and spade men
were losing money at the prices which
.previously prevailed. Tne largest-factory
in America., which burned down just be
fore the trust formed (the plant of a Pitts
burg manufacturer), has been rebuilt, but c
lias not been put into working order.' In
trr.de circles it is' known that the trust
pays to keep the plant idle, and. as a local
dealer expressed it, the plant "makes
money, but no shovels."

Reduction of 'Wanes. 'â¢ -
TOLEDO. Ohio, Jan. 31.â President W.
1). Mahon of tne National Association of
Street .Railway Employes, arrived here
to-day to" consult with the local union in
the matter of the Toledo Traction Com

TRENTON, N. J., Jan. 31.â The Masonic
Grand Lodge of New Jersey has decided
to build a home for aged and infirm mem
bers of the order, and a committee of
three, headed by Grand Master Forlmeyer,
is in practical charge of the enterprise. A
site containing thirteen acres and a man

to maintain the institution.
CAUGHT AFTER MANY YEARS.
Arrest of Thomas H. Stout, Once a
Trusted Bookkeeper, Who Committed
Daring Forgeries.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Jan. 31.â Thomas
H. Stout, alias Appleton, alias Robert
Craham, who is under arrest in Cincin
nati and is believed to be a forger wanted
by the police of this city, was for some
years the confidential bookkeeper of the
Wall-street firm of Jones, Kennelt it Hop
kins. He was always considered a steady
man until hit sudden disappearance on
September 1, 1.91. Upon the examination
of his books-it was found that Stout had
forged the firm's name to checks on the
Holland Trust Company of 99 Cedar street
to the sum of ?IG.OOD. Nothing was heard
of him for some lime, until finally it was
learned that he was in London, where he
was doing business wit** a firm of Ameri
can brokers in that place with the firm
name of John Shaw. In London he was
known as Appleton, and was said to have
considerable money, buying and selling
American stocks.
Detectives were sent to London, but he
had disappeared. He was traced from
London to Antwerp and from there to
Paris, where he adopted the name of
Graham and then suddenly disappeared.
Several years went by and .nothing was
heard from him. Filially the Holland
Trust Company asked the police of this
city a short time ago to again take up the
case and more circulars were sent abroad
and to ie police in every city in the
United Slates. The trust company also
offered a reward of $250 for his arrest, but
nothing was heard from him until Friday
last, wnen Captain O'Brien received a
telegram from Cincinnati announcing his
arrest there. The trust .company, who
were the sufferers of Stout's forgeries, wer**
notified of the information from Cincin
nati and persons were sent to Cincinnati
to see if they could identify him.
They identified him as Stout, and sent
word that the prisoner would come to this
city without the necessary requisition pa
pers. Detective Daly of Captain O'Brien's
staff left here to-day to bring him to this
city.
It is also said by the police that they
think Stout has forged checks on the Sea
board National Bank to the extent of
nearly $6000, and that they will also prose
cute him. A reporter called at 201 West
One Hundred and Tenth street, where
Mrs. Stout resides, and in reply to several
questions she admitted that the man under
arrest was her husband, but further than
this would have nothing to say about the
matter. She, however, added that she
thought it was all a mistake.
MRS. BOOTH'S NOBLE WORK.
Es abl/shng Homes for Ex-Prisoners or
Graduates From the State Prisons
of the Country.
TRENTON, N. J., Jan. 31.â Mrs. Bal
lington Booth, formerly of the Salvation
Army and now at the bead of the Volun
teers, is a visitor at the Slate prison here,
with the object of securing members from
i among the convicts for her organization.
She delivered two addresses â one this
morning and the other in the afternoon â
in which she explained to the prisoners
the character of the work she was now
engaged in. Her audience in each ad
dress consisted of about 500 convicts, and
there were present besi .es, as invited
guests, Mrs. Emily Williamston of the
State Charities and Aid Association,
Mayor Yard of Trenton, Senator Voorhees
of Union County, Speaker MacPnerson of
the House of the Assembly and a few
others.
Mrs. Booth informed the prisoners that
eight months ago she had dedicated the
remainder of her lite to the service of men
and women in prisons of this country.
She loved them and could and would help
l those who wanted to live better lives.
I There were outside of the prisons many
i worse people than there was inside. Her
organization, she said, was the Volunteer
Prison League. Homes would be estab
lished for ex-prisoners, or "graduates, '' as
she preferred to call them, and detectives
and policemen would not be permitted to
cross their thresholds.
In New York she had established a Hail
of Hope, In which she expected to shelter
many "graduates." She expected 100 of
them down from Sing Sing next April.
Rev. George Maddock, chaplain of the
State Prison, and the prison quartet took
part in the exercises, and nearly 600 pris
oners declared their intention oi joining
Mrs. Booth's. league.
To-morrow Mrs. Booth will go into the
cells of the prisoners for individual work,
which is even more effective. She intends
visiting in turn all the great prisons.
Financial help will be forthcoming, she
says, for the establishment of several
; homes similar to the Hall of Hope.

Presses.!
BERLIN. Germany, Jan. Public
interest in the Reichstag this week has
been at the very lowest ebb. At no time
have tnere been more than thirty mem
bers in the building, including those in
the restaurant or library, and it has been
next to impossible to obtain a quorum.
In view of this state of apathy on the
part of the imperial legislative body, it is
not surprising that the reslaiirateur who
holds the contract to supply the members
with meals refuses to keep the restaurant
open any longer unless ne is subsidized,
and has given formal notice that he will
retire on April 1. In the meantime an
other contractor will be advertised for,
but what success will attend the attempt
to get a responsible and competent person
to undertake the service remains io be
seen. Apart from th*? fact that the keeper
receives no subsidy, the terms of his con
tract rÂ« quire him to furnish members of
the Reichstag with a full dinner at the
very reasonable rate of a mark and a half
a head and a limited repast at one mark
each.
The National Zeitung, commenting
upon the fact that there were only ten
members present upon the occasion of a
recent debate upon an important
measure, says: "Members of the Reich
stag appear to think that debates are
useless, as they lead to no practical
action."
The Berlin newspapers, noticing the
visit to the German capital of Count
Muravieff, the Russian Foreign Minister,
contrast the general indifference shown to
his presence in the city with the interest
taken in the recent sojourn of Count Go
lnchowski. Brief as Count Goluchowski's
stay in Berlin was, it resulted in an im
portant change in Germany's policy to
ward the Sultan and probably also in the
Balkans.
The Austrian Government has long
maintained that the objects of the Drei
bund, and especially of the dual alliance,
could only be attained by concert of
policy at Constantinople. The adhesion
of Germany to the Russian schemes of re
form without co--rcion, while Austria and
Italy supported England in insisting upon
coercion if necessary, was neld by the
Austrian Minister to menace the stability
of the alliance.
Count Goluchowski is understood to
have made the all-important declaration
to the Kaiser and Prince Hobenlobe that
Austria and Italy would join them in im
posing by force the needful reforms upon
the Sultan, if they had to act without the
co-operation of France and Russia. Noth
ing but defeat in diplomacy and disap
pointment of aim has resulted from the
attempts of Germany to cultivate the
friendship of Russia. The Russo-French
entente has grown in closeness, while the
understanding between the Dreibnnd pow
ers has been subjected to some strain.
Count Goluchowski has now succeeded
in obtaining such a full agreement with
the Kaiser as will enable the Embassadors
of the three powers to work in perfect har
mony. If the Turkish correspondence is
sued by the English Foreign Office had
been completed up to date, instead of fin
ishing at the close of December, the mod
ification in Germany's policy would have
been set to alter the position* in the east.
The Kaiser is no longer a hard and fast
opponent of coercion, but has agreed to
join In coercion if the other powers are
unanimous.
Europe is thus within view of present
ing the Sultan with a programme of re
form under compulsion, not the moral
pressure tbat the Russian Government
still holds out for, but the material en
forement which Austria, Italy and Eng
land have for some time agreed upon.
A draft of the reform demands have at
last been prsented to the Sultan through
Baron v*>n Calice, the president at the
Embassadorinl conference.
The semi-official idea of the scheme of
the powers has teen received. The prov
ince^, Asiatic as well as Europe, are to re
ceive some sort of elective councils, with
administrative governments. A council
of State, composed of members represent
ing the provinces and members appointed
by the Sultan, is to sit for a stated annual
period in Constantinople. This council
will have a voice in the appointment of
Ministers and in the arrangement of
finances. The Sultan is to govern through
his Ministers and not through the palace
functionaries, and the administration of
justice is also to be reformed.
The struggle which is proceeding in
Austria between the Clerical and Anti-
Semite coalition and the German Liberals
and the Social Democrats is watched here
with the keenest interest. The forecasts
of the rÂ£sul:s of the election, predicting
the triumph of the Clerico-Anu-Seiniie
parties, have already been cabled. Count
Badeni, the Austrian Premier, despite his
circular to the provincial governors direct
ing them to observe the strictest im
partiality, is undoubtedly assisting the
groups which the liberals call reactionary.
Count Badeni's organ, the Reichswehr,
in an official communication diffuses the
necessity of creating a new governmental
party, which is to embrace all parties of
conservatism and Catholicism and which
will "worthily sustain the best traditions
of the Austrian state."
i The aristocratic clubs, such r.s the
Hohenwart (the feudal party in Bohemia),
and the Clericals in the Tyroi-Salzburg',
Upper Austria and Styria, are rallying to
the call of Badeni. This new party will
forts the center in the coming Reicbsrath
and tbo nucleus of a strong Government
majority. The Socialists arc actively
working an electoral acitation in Vienna
and in all the manufacturing centers, and
Cxpect to secure about twenty scats.
They have fair prospects in some work
; inirmcn's districts in the north, especially
i in Bobemia, where the excitement is in
tense, and the elections are not likely to
pass off without rioting. The mixed
nationalities of Austria are in a ferment
and present a more complex election
problem than ever, but Count Badeni will
get -he sort of 'majority he wants.
Thp young Princes received a visit from
the Empress, who came to Ploen to bee
her sons, who are attending school there,
and later proceeded to Kiel, to be present
at th*> christening of the newborn son of
the Emperor's brother, Prince Henry of
Prussia. > ,
The Emperor has added the penalty of
expulsion from the army to the sentence
of five years' imprisonment which was
imposed on Lieutenant Baron Brusewi'.z,
who killed an artisan named Siebemann
in a cafe at Carisruhe some time ago for a
fancied insult to his dignity as an officer.
Report says that the Kaiser has ar
ranged to pay a visit to Spain, and has re
ceived an intimation from Queen Regent
Christina that she will be glad to receive
the Emperor and Empress in Madrid.
The court at Mayence I. as condemned
Percy Bartholow, United States Consul at
that place, to pay a line of 200 marss for
assaulting and severely injuring an in
mate of his bouse by striking him on the
i cad with a revolver. The assault was
committed in October last, and in Novem
ber ii was reported that the proceedings
had been abandoned upon his settling
with the injured man privately, but this
appears not to have been the case. Bariho
low set up the plea of no jurisdiction, but
the court rejected lt. The Consul will
now appal from the judgment of the
court, and proposes to call upon Embassa
dor Ãbl to intervene.
The Prussian Minister of Agriculture
has recently altered the regulation of the
importation of American horses. The
executive authorities have been instructed
that henceforth American horses are to be
kept isolated at the ports of entry for
eight -days. Alter veterinary inspection
during that period, they are to be free for
sale or inland transportation if the
veterinary surgeon declares them free of
infectious disease. .
The Government is about to send a
special commission to Bombay to investi
gate the bubonic nlague which is raging
there, with a view of adopting a pre
cautionary measure against -the intro
duction of the. disease into Europe. Dr.
Koch, the eminent bacteriologist, has been
summoned from South Africa to head
the commission.
A circular issued by the French sugar
syndicate is being warmly discussed in
commercial circles connected with the
German sugar industry. The circular
states that the French refiners would ask
nothing from the Government if Germany
and Austria, aiming at the ruin of tne
French sugar trade, had not created the
export bounty system and now were
opposed to its complete abolition.
"The weapon," adds the circular, "ri
vals use against us must be used against
them. The French sugar industry abso
lutely condemn the export bounty system,
and if the French refiners are forced to
demand the continuance of bounties, it is
only in order to paralyze thereby the
effects of the German-Austrian bounty
stem.
Tlie Berlin Handelsblatt voices public
and trade opinion here in expressing the
hope that an understanding between
France, Austria and Germany to abolish
all bounties will ere long be arrived at.
Seeing that each Government has professed
willingness to reduce or abolish the boun
ties, provided the other Governments
act in concert, there ought to be no dif
ficulty in agreeing.
The Berlin Municipal Council has de
cided to distribute in all the schools in
Berlin on the occasion of the Kaiser Wii

at a cost of 20,000 marks will be so dis
tributed. .\
The great costume procession, which
will be a big feature in the centenary
celebration, will be increased by a grand

and the Niederwali monument. The car
will be drawn by sixteen horses and sur
rounded by a squadron of armor-clad
knights.
Prince Egon Fuerstenberg, heir of tho

nent residence in Austria and on his Bo
hemian estate. He promises a short an
nual visit to Germany, so as to be entitled
to exercise his rights as a member of the
Upper House of the Prussian Landtag
and of the Upper Chamber 01 Baden. It
will be something of a loss to Germany
that the famous stable of the late Prince
Fuerstenberg will now be transferred to
Austria. The Fuerstenberg races were

OUTLAW TAYLOR
CLOSELY GUARDED
Boasts That He Will Yet
Escape F/om Hanford's
Prison.
One ex-Missourian Who Visits
â¢ His Cell Not Positive as to
His Identity.
His Doubts Dispelled by a Frank
Admission Made by the Meeks
â¢ Murderer.
HANFORD. Cal., Jan. There seems
to be little doubt that the man captured
on Friday at a sheep camp near Hanford
is George Taylor, cne of the murderers of
the Meeks family. Lane, the Missourian
who first met Taylor in this vicinity and
gave the officers the information which
led to the apprehension of the outlaw, is
positive that the right man has been
taken. He knew the Taylors well in Mis
souri, and although confinement in jail
and a roving life following his escape has
somewhat altered tne appearance of the
once prominent stock-raiser, Lane says
there can be no mistake as to his identity.
To-day another ex-Missourian, James
Sayers, who is now teaching school at
Goshen, was sent for and visited the jail
to identify Taylor. He last saw tbe mur
derer of the Meeks family in 1892, having
been then but slightly acquainted with
him. Sayers was- not fully satisfied â  and
would not say positively that the man
now in the Kings County prison is the
one for whom Missouri officers have been
seeking for months past. He. believed
George Taylor to have been a taller man
with a larger chin.
When he knew Taylor the latter always
wore a Prince Albert coat. His hair was
dressed in the prevailing fashion and his
clothes were those of the city clubman.
The man who appeared before Sayers to
day was rough and unkempt in appear
ance, and his hair nad been innocent of
the touch of the shears for many months
past. He was attired in rude and ragged
garments that did not belie his own state
ment that he had been a passenger on
freightcar brakebeams over all the rail
roads on the coast.
But if Sayers was not able to positively
identify the prisoner Taylor himself gave
evidence that he had known the school
teacher before. As he came out from his
cell he was measured and found to be 5
feet t\\_ inches tall. Sheriff Buckner
raised tne heavy shock of hair from his
forehead and temples, revealing features
intelligent in appearance. Taylor has a
high forehead, and the lines of his sun
browned face betokened learning. Sheriff
Buckner told the prisoner that- an old
friend of his wished to see him. As Sayers
stepped forward Taylor was asked if he
knew who the visitor was. Taylor looked
at Sayers and said, hesitatingly, that he
thought he had seen him before, and if
not Sayers he had seen the latter's brother
or some one who looked like him.
"Did you know his brother?" tbe Sheriff
asked. â¢ .
"I never knew any good of him," was
the reply.
Sayers' brother helped to capture Taylor
in Missouri, and the prisoner's admission
is evidence that he knew both the visitor
to his cell and the latter's brother. His
manner when he first looked upon S3yres
was proof also- that he did not see him
for the first time.
Taylor has become very boastful. He
laughs at the supposed weakness of the
iron bars which imprison him, and says
ho will wager that he can cut through
them within five minutes. He declares
that ho will never be taken back to
Missouri. The outlaw will be closely
guarded until the Eastern officers arrive
with requisition papers. They realize
that they have no ordinary criminal to
deal with.
DEL MONTE IMPROVEMENTS.
Numerous Changes Intended to Enhance
the Popularity of the Famed
Hostelry.
DEL MONTE, Cal., Jan. 31.â T0 those
who know California's world-famed re
sort, beautiful Del Monte, in its many at
tractive phases, it would seem that to sat
about improving it would be. a needless
undertaking: But with all its pleasant
ness Del Monte is not quite up to date,
and the inanajement proposes to make it
so that no one can find fault. An addi
tion will be built at the rear of the central
portion of the hotel, but running parallel
on its longest side with the present large
dining-room. This addition will be di
vided into two supper or breakfast rooms,
which will be separated by wide folding
doors, so that in the dull season of the
early winter months, when guests are
comparatively few, it can be thrown into
one moderately sized dining-room and
thus make it possible to close the main
dining-room, which now must be used
whether the guests be few or many.
The. present reading-room will be con
verted into a cafe, in which light refresh
ments will be served at all hours, and from
this room a series of swinging glass doors
will' open on to the veranda. The veranda
will be inclosed in glass and heated, and
growing flowers and palms will make it a
charming place at all seasons of the year.
This arrangement will enable the guests
to have afternoon tea or a cup of choco
late after the morning dip in the surf,
without being obliged to retire to their
rooms to be served.
To make up lor the loss of the reading
room the bed chambers on the south cor
ridor will be demolished and in their
place two reading and writing rooms â one
for ladies and one for gentlemenâ will be
substituted and fitted up attractivly. In
the basement of the addition a cyclery
will be built.
, hen the new dining-rooms are fin
ished the hotel will be immediately put
upon the European plan entirely, and the
management feels assured that the change
will give satisfaction.
LEGAL FIGHT OVER FEES.
Administrator Ausi rais Brings Action
Against a Count,/ Clerk.
. SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 31.â An important
legal point in regard to the filing of ap
praisements of estates will come up in the
Superior Court to-morrow morning on the
application of J. E. Auzerais for a writ of
mandate to compel .County Clerk Pfister
to file an appraisement in the estate of
Edouard A. Auzerais, deceased.
Edward L. Auzerais, administrator of
the estate of Ei. Guard A. Auzerais, filed an
inventory and appraisement of the prop
erty comprising an estate valued at
$668,000. Edward L. Auzerais died and
John E. Auzerais became administrator of
the estate. A second appraisement was
made and was presented ior filing to
County Clerk Pfister yesterday by J. R.
Patton, attorney for the administrator.
The County Cierk refused to file the ap
praisement on the ground that the law
requires the payment of a fee of $1 for
every $1000 of ihe estate over $3000. The
administrator claims he should pay only
15 coats, the usual filing fee, as the ap
praisement has once been filed and paid
ior at the regular rates'.
SANTA CLARA'S PETITION.
Will Ask for an Appropriation for the
Repair of the Moint Hamil
ton Road.
SAN JOSE. Cal.. Jan. 31.â The Legisla
ture will be asked to make an appropria
tion for the repair of the Mount Hamilton
read, which was constructed to the Lick
Observatory by Santa Clara County at a
cost of $100,000. Steps to this end have
been taken by the Supervisors and the
matter is in the hands of the legislative
delegation from this county. The road
was constructed in 1876 and since that
time little repairing has been done to it.'
It is twenty-eight miles long and runs
through a rough; mountainous country.
Tho road is a very expensive one to keep
in repair, and as the law requires that
money raised for road purposes shall be
expended in the district where it is col
lected, it is im possible to keep the road in
first-class condition with tne small amount
raised in that sparsely settled section.
The amount of money that can be ex
pended on the road do**" not exceed $200
yearly. The culverts are rotting, bridges
need repairing and tbe road graveling,
and unless the State renders assistance
the finest mountain road in the United
States will be destroyed, and it will cost j
many limes the amount, now necessary to <
repair it.";*. â 
The county derives but little benefit from
the road, and it is thought the State should
help keep it in good condition, as most of
the travel over it is by tourists and visitors
to the observatory, it is understood the
Regents of the Slate University, who have
control of the observatory, will indorse
the application for an appropriation.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 31.â A musical

Peculiar Deaths at Vancouver.
VANCOUVER, Wash., Jan. 31â
sudden deaths during the past forty-eight
hours of Sylvester Wickers and wife, the
latter's death preceding that of the hus
i band by only thirty hours, have created a
sensation here. The Coroner held a very
unsatisfactory and incomplete inquest,
which has tended only to muddle matters
more. The supposition is that the hus
band, either through cruel treatment or
j otherwise, caused his wife's death and
then ended his own life with a draught of
I carbolic acid.

Probably . Fatal Shooting
Affray in a Saloon at

Miner . James Van Rapper the
. Victim and B. T. Price
His Assailant
Tha One Strikes Oat to Avenge an
Insult and Receives Cold
Lead.
CALIENTE, Cal., Jan. 31.â Newscomei
j from Kernville of a probably fatal shoot
ing which occurred there this afternoon.
B. T. Price, a brother of Thomas Price of
San Francisco, was the man who used the
revolver, and his victim was James Van
i Rapper, a miner of Kernville. The crime
I was committed in Perry's saloon.
Van Rapper was talking with Perry
concerning certain friends of his when
Price joined in the conversation and made
disparaging remarks concerning the men
of whom they were speaking. Van Rap
per took offense and made an angry re
ply. At this Price called him a liar, and
was knocked down for the insult.' 'Ââ¢!
Price arose and drew a revolver. He
shot at Van Rapper twice, the first bullet
striking near the heart, ' penetrating a
pocketbook and letters, glancing on a rib
and lodging in the right side.
The second shot was taken as Van Rap
per attempted to run from the room. The
bullet pierced both legs below the knee.
Van Rapper is not likely to recover, as a
physician could not be obtained imme
diately and his wounds were not dressed.
Late to-night a surgeon who had been
summoned from Los Angeles had not yet
ar rived.
This affray calls attention to the almost
total disregard of the law in Kernville. No
arrests have been made, nor is it likely
that the town authorities will take any
action. Shooting scriraages are frequent
in Kernville. Nearly every male resident
of the town goes about well-armed, ana in
true Western fashion feels called upon to
draw and fire at the slightest provocation.

LOS ANGELES, Cm... Jan. 31.âGov
ernor Budd and the State Senate and As
sembly committee, on a tour of inspection
to the State institutions and proposed
sites for others in Southern California,
reached Los Angeles this afternoon from
San Bernardino. There are twenty
members in the party- They have made
a careful investigation of the workings
and needs of the reform school at \\hit
tier. inquiries into the feasibility of estab
lishing anew State normal school and a
State wharf at San Diego, inspected the
asylum for the insane at Highlands and
visited the State normal tchool in this
City. The party was met at the Arcade
Depot here by the trustees of the normal
school and Superintendent Pierce and
taken in carriages to the normal build
ings, where Professor Pierce acted as pilot
and explainer of the uses of the diffeient
apparati and appurtenances in the various
rooms. The Governor was much inter
ested in the plans in the Sloyd industrial
department and the gymnasium. He ex
pressed gratification at what he saw and
the good uses made of former appropria
tions for this school. ;.:N . . "
Superintendent Fierce will ask for the i
small appropriation this year of $5000
' extra, to be used in removing and remod
â  cling the gymnasium. The importance ol
the proposed change was made clear to
â¢â¢the Governor and the members ol the
committee. Professor Pierce started for ;
.Sacramento to-night to look out for the
â¢ annual appropriation bill.
. During the party's stay in the city the j
Governor and several members of the
â¢ committee were interviewed by a Call
'-. correspondent. The Governor spoke in
the most flattering terms of the zeal of the
committee in making the inspection, and
said that no doubt great benefit would re
sult from the investigation. The com
: mittee, it seems, is a composite one, in
cluding two or more, members from "each
.of.the regularly constituted committees j .
of the present Legislature. -â¢ â¢ ."*
'..One of the chief objects of this.inspec- j
â¢ tion tour is to get a clearer conception of.
- the advisability of transferring the Whit- i
tier girl- to the vacated State institution .
for the leeb!g-minded at Santa Clara. It I
â¢ was learned from Senator La Hue of Napa
and others that the change will undoubt- |
edly result ior the "best, relieving over- j
crowded . Whittier, assuring far better
discipline for the girls, at a slightly in- j
creased expenditure, and giving room for j
smaller boys at the reform school. When j
questioned about- his veto of- two years ;
ago of the bill making' an appropriation '
for a normal school at San Diego, the '
Governor said:
"I guess the legislators will understand
the situation now.and will do the right j
thing." &^flÃ_9B__V*H_|
The lack of harmony among the offi- j
cials at Whittier was regretted by two or
three Senators, but it was not stated j
where the blame lies'.
San Diego is asking for $75,000 for a new j
normal school, and two sites were pre- i
eented to the committee. It is reasonably
safe to say that the committee will not
recommend ". the '/ appropriation. The
wharf project seems to have impressed
the committee much more favorably, and, '
since $25,000 only has been asked for the
purpose, it. is likely that the building of '
the wharf will be recommended. '
Superintendent Campbell of the High- |
lands Asylum has asked for the modest I
sum of $330,000 for that institution, most
â¢ of which he will hot realize this year.
The asylum is reported overcrowded, but
splendidly managed.

GYPSIES NEAR MILL VALLEY.
Pitiful Sight at a Ram-Soaked Camp
Where Dwells a Party of Brazil
ian Romanies.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Jan. 31.â A sight
can be witnessed to-night near Mill Val
ley which is not only awful but heartrend
ing and appeals to every sympathy in the
human breast. A band of'gypsies has its
camp pitched just beyond Millwood sta
tion, about one mile below Mill Valley,
and the rain and wind has rendered the
temporary habitation a sorry place. The
ramshackle tents which the gypsies have
erected to serve as protection against the
storm are water-soaked and leaking, and
the cold, raw winds sweeping over the
marshes from Richardson* -Bay adds to
their pitiable condition. The houses are
exposed to the fury of the storm, and the
water rushes down the embankments and
flows through the camp in streams. The
ground is thoroughly soaked and the
camp, save for a bluflon the west, is with
out shelter from the wind.
The women are half clothed and the
children are not as well provided for.
Fires can be started only in the tents and
these Diazes are ihe only means by which
the unfortunate band can keep warm.
The encampment has been located be
low Millwood for a number of days, and
Deputy Constable Ben Miller, who inter
viewed the chief, elicited the information
that the band was on its way to Honolulu.
I- came trom Brazil and the chief stated
that the Brazilian Minister was making
arrangements for the trip to the islands
so that the band hoped to continue its
journey in a short time. The gypsies
seem to have plenty of money and have
purchased much food in town. Last night
they held a feast and liberal quantities of
wine and beÂ«-r were indulged in. The
band hjfl given no trouble and the people
of Mill Valley have not been molested by
petty debredations, as has been the case
when gypsies have been encamped in the
vicinity before.

Oakland Unanimously Chosen as the
Next Meeting- Place of the
Association.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., Jan. 31.â The
twenty-six. annual convention of the
Pacilic Turn Bezirk of North .American
Turn Bundes was called to order in
Masonic Temple this morning by Presi
dent Albert Currlin of San Jose. The roll
call by Secretary Ludwig Weber showed
forty delegates present, representing every
society in the district save Santa Cruz.
In the election of permanent officers of
the convention, Louis Markus of . San
Francisco was chosen president, Dr. H.
Moore of Oakland vice-president, Reinholt
Miller of San Francisco secretary and Fred
Guentherof San Francisco assistant sec
retary.
After the president had appointed the
usual committees on organization, the
order of business was the reports of the
retiring president, secretary, treasurer and
district turn leaders, and also of the
committee on the festival held at Santa
Cruz last year. The secretary reported an
increase in membership of thirty-one. The
average attendance compared favorably
with that of last year.
A petition signed by twenty-eight mem
bers of the Santa Cruz Turn Verein, set
ting forth the fact that the society has re
scinded its action withdrawing from the
North American Turners' Union was read.
The executive committee was instructed
to notify the Santa Cruz Turn Verein that
its action in withdrawing was not in ac
cordance with the .constitution.
Oakland was unanimously chosen as the
next meeting place of the convention. On
account of the gymnastic festival an
nounced to be held at St. Louis in May. it
was decided not to hold a similar meet
ing on this coast this year.
The committee on investigation c books
and accounts reported ail in cood order.
It was agreed that a Turn Verein must be
long at least three years tothe Turn Bezirk
before it can hold a festival, and ii was de
cided to request the various Turn Vereins
to allow young men between 18 and 21
years of age to become members on pay
ment of half dues.
To-night a banquet was tendered the del
egates at Turner Hail. Mayor Ellis and
t..e Town Council and prominent citizens
were present to welcome the strangers.
BUR ROUGH VALLEY MYSTERY.
Authorities Now Believe That Rancher Ben
â¢ son's Triplets Were Killed by His
Sister-in-Law.
FRESNO. Cal., Jan. 31.â Deputy Dis
trict Attorney E. A. Williams is of tbe
opinion that there will be some startling
developments concerning the death of
three babes which were born to the In
dian wife of Edward A. Benson in Bur
lough Valley recently, immediately be
fore her death. It was at first reported
that the triplets had been strangled by
thei. - father, who could not see his way
clear to rear them after the death of their
mother. The authorities went to the
mountains and held an inquest over the
bodies of the babes, but could not find
substantial evidence that they had been
murdered.
Subsequent investigations hayÂ« con
vinced Mr. Williams that there are good
grounds for believing that the triplets
were choked to death by an Indian woman
known as Miss vVaterwheel, a sister of
the deceased mother. It appears to be a
custom among the Indians to dispatch
newly born infants if their mothers die.
They believe that the little ones cannot
live anyway, and consider it best to end
their existence at once and relieve them
of suffering. Mrs. Benson was a squaw,
and her sister is believed to have carried
out the custom of the tribe.
When Dr. Adair conducted the autopsy
on the bodies of the triplets at the time
Coroner Long held the inquest, he found
bruises on the throats of two, which would
indicate that they had been strangled, but
he did not consider that the marks were
sufficient to establish the fact. Constable
Dennis of Sentinel, who has also been
conducting investigations, expresses the
same opinion as Mr. Williams. He is
being assisted by some half-breeds in his
inquiries. All the evidence is being
gained from Indians, and this, of coursa,
is not the most satisfactory to advance in
court.
When the inquest was held Miss Water
wheel, Benson and his children all testi
fied that the babes had died from natural
causes. Benson's home, where the al
leged triple murder took piace, is situated
in a deep ravine in Burroueh Valley. It
is an out-of-the-way place and few white
people ever visit it. The road down to the
house is a tortuous one. Indians are the
only ones who frequent the place.
MOLINA TAKEN TO FRESNO.
The Captured Out/aw Will Be Tried for
a Murder Committed Four
Years Ago.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. Deputy Sheriff
Peck arrived last night from Ban Luis
Obispo with Ramon Molina, a Mexican,
who was arrested a few days ago in that
city for the murder of a young man
named Trinidad on Cantua Creek, in the
wastern portion of this county, in 1893.
The Sheriff of this county had received an
intimation that Molina was in San Luis
Obispo, and telegraphed to the Sheriff of
the latter county to arrest him.
Molina is about 55 years of age and can
not speak English. He killed Trinidad in
a cabin over a dispute regarding the pos
session of land. He is said to have been
drunk when he committed the murder
He conveyed his victim's body in a wheel
barrow to Cantua Creek and buried it in
the sand. Hogs uncovered it a few days
later and it was found. The killing was
witnessed by Joe Tirado, and Molina at
tempted to kill him also. The murderer
was chasing the witness with a six-shooter
when Frank Lynch and John S. Wright
drove up. Then he took after them and
chased them away. Molina disappeared
and Sheriff â¢ Hensley was unable to find
him.
Sheriff Scott and his deputies have never
relaxed their efforts to find the fugitive,
and a few days ago their perseverance was
rewarded by locating him at San Luis
Obispo.
A* far as can be learned Molina's killing
of Trinidad was wholly uujustifiab.e. He
is said to have shot the young man down
in cold blood, and intended to killTirado,
the only witness to the deed.

erate of Wilson's, giving his name as John
Murray, was also taken into custody by
the officers. Wilson executed the forger
ies and Murray's duties were to cash
them, while the forger waited for him
outside. "'-'â¢;
When searched three checks for $27 each
were found on Wilson's person. He had
forged the names of Mayor C. C. Cray
croft, W. B. Short and W. B. Copeland
to tbem, tut his imitations were very
poor. At thÂ«i two stores where Murray
tried to pass Wilson's checks, the clerks
suspected that they were forgeries and re
fused to cash them.
In 1888 Wilson was sent from Fresno to
Folsom to serva a term for grand larceny,
which he committed in entering a tailor
shop and stealing a quantity of clothing.
He is about 45 years "of age. Wilson ac
knowledges his guilt.
TACOMA'S CHURCH TROUBLE.
Pastor Harriman, Accused of Insanity,
Resigns and Denounces His
Congregation.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 31.â The cul
mination of the troubles that have almost
broken up tho First Baptist church came
this morning when Rev. N. H. Harriman,
the pastor, arose and read his resignation.
The congregation was dumfounaed, and
did not take any action. It could scarcely
nave done so, for the minister was so firm
and calm in making his statement, that
nothing was left to be said. He upbraided
the congregation. Said he:
"While I have been delivering Christ's
messages at the hall (referring to the
'come-outer' meetings he led last week),
members of this church, in covenant rela
tions with me and my family, and claim
ing to love me and them, believed and
gave currency to the satanic rumor â
satan's last stroke to. destroy man's testi
mony that he cannot silence that I had
become mentally unbalanced."
The denouncement was full of sarcasms,
and closed with a fervent declaration that
all was in the hands of God. The church
will probably not select another pastor
for several weeks.
The pastor to-night preached a powerful
sermon in another building and was lis
tened to by a majority of the members of
the Baptist church, who evidently are go
ing to stand by him. Not within several
weeks has this man, now charged with be
ing insane, appeared so rational. Since
the trouble began, three .'weeks ago, he
Las been fasting, praying and leading per
sonal !.anctllicatior. meetings, which were
attended by large crowds of the curious.

Mill Valley Entertainment.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Jan. 31.â The
entertainment given last evening by tho
young ladies of Mill Valley for the benefit

"Spider Kelly" and "Peppers," pugi

HYDE REPLIES
TO THE AUDITOR
The Ex-Director Supports
His Position Regarding
School Finances.
He . Discusses Nepotism as an
Offense Common in the
Last Board.
Mission High Schoolâ A Claim That
Contractors Are Taking Des
perate Chances.
F. A. Hyde, ex-School Director, submits
the following reply to Auditor Broderick,
in re finances of the School Department:
I did .not know until 1 read the Auditor's
statement that I was engaged in any personal
controversy with him.- In my recent Inter
view with a Call reporter I stated my views
on certain legal points and the Auditor makes
apir-onal attaci*. on me in his-reply. lam
quite willing to meet it: -â¢>.:.
He states truly that he refused to audit sev
eral bills contracted by the .Board of Educa
tion of .which I was president, which I had
approved as such, and it.is a fact that his ac
tion was to my "displeasure and vexation" so
far as I pllowed myself to be displeased or
vexed by the combinations that we're persist
ently obstructing the efforts ot the board to
reform school affairs in this City. The mat
ters to which he reicrs were, to the best of my
recollection, as follows:
There are ore seventy-five* schools in this
City, In charge of as many different princi
pals, among wnom, as a whole, there was no
uniformity of standard nor unity of action.
Each principal had his or her own interpreta
tion of the course of study, and, in late yearn,
no effort had been made to bring the depart
mem up to a modern standard, or to keep pace
with other cities - in improved educational
facilities. The Hoard of Education, with a
view to getting the latest and d st that there
was in such matters, employed Professor
Voder, who had high recommendations from
Eastern normal *>c'iooiÂ« and educators, as a
scholar, lecturer and teacher, and he was ap
pointed "Teacher of Methods," the idea being
that lie could interpret many new ideas to
our principals and teachers, and .assist in ele
vating the whole educational tone of the de
partment. . . Â,_â¢ "
Then there was the case of Miss Ball, who
was employed as a teacher of drawing. She
nad had extended experience as supervisor in
Eastern' cities and came very highly recom
mended. At one time the department had
wasted a good deal of money in the emp.oy
liieiit ot drawing teachers, who went irom
shoot to school as class .teachers. Very little
good was accomplished because of the limited
amount of time, that could be given to any
one. pupil or class. The board thought that
the work could be done by the regular teach
ers, but, as it was new to most of them, it was
proposed that one supervising teacher be em
ployed, who would direct and systematize the
work, and that It would be a good deal
cheaper to instruct'the teachers, and through
them the children, than to proceed under the
old system. 5 â :'.,â 
The employment of these two persons ex
cited the opposition o: a certain class of teach
ers who persistently opposed every effort of the
board to bring the department to any state of
discipline, and who had had their own way
\ so long without supervision that it was ex
tremely In-some for them to submit to au
thority. The majority of the School Directors
paid no attention to these complaints, but
when tho warrants of Mr. Voder and Miss Uall
came before the Auditor the ma. contents had
better success and be refused to sign them.
He was not sustained therein, either by the
law or the decision of the courts. He pro
fussed to find authority for his action. in a de
cision of the Supreme. Court, in the case of
Harry vs. Kennedy/wherein the court decided
that the School Directors were not authorized
to employ inspectors, their authority being
limited to the employment of teachers, but it
was] perfectly evident to any unbiased person
that the Barry case whs not Authority,- because
Mr. Voder and Miss Ball were not inspectors
nor superintendents, but were engaged daily
in teaching. . .â ..â -"â â â¢" â  â¢
Neither one of them, however, could afford
to go into the courts to maintain their rights,
for it meantconsiderabie expense and long
delay. So Mr. Yoiier was elected principal of
the Normal School i.nd Miss Hall a teacher oi
drawing therein, and the unprogressive, selllsh
and vicious element in the' department
triumphed. â¢
A strict and literal construction of the deci
sion in the Barry case .will slop the pay of
every principal In - tne department in schools
oi eight classes and upward, none of whom
teach classes.
Another warrant that the Auditor refused
to approve was that Of Mr. Beanston for a
compensation of .*SO a month as clerk of the
standing committees of the board. If there
was ever a righteous and worthy appropria
tion of money ii was in this case. The Auditor
was sustained in his action by a rigid and
very technical construction of an act of the
Legislature, but were he to construe the
various provisions of the consolidation act
and other laws governing the administration
of municipal affairs in this City as closely as he
did in the "casi of -Beanston hundreds of em
ployes could not receive their pay.
When it was first decided to pay Mr. Bean
ston this $50 a month the matter was sub
mitted to Auditor Smiley, who decided in
favor thereof; and, later, when Mr. Broderick
followed Mr. Smiley as Auditor, he, too, wil
lingly signed Mr. Beanston's demand, until
Mayor Ellert took umbrage at some remarks
that I had made concerning him and called
Into question the validity of the board's action
in paying this compensation to Mr. Beanston,
after which the Auditor refused to audit the
Beanston warrants.
Ido no; now remember any other warrants
that he refused to audit for claims approved
by me as president of the Board ot Education ;
but if he did I will say that they were equally
meritorious, and the Auditor's objections
equally frivolous. If he had been as particu
lar in his dealings with the last Board of Edu
cation there would have been some check on
their prodigal extravagance.
AS TO the PRESENT BOARD.
Mr. Waller says hat the construction of the
Mission High School has already been com
menced and that there Is therefore a neces
sity for the appointment of a supervising in
spector. I was not advised that the work had
been begun, and if it has then lam willing to
concede that some one should be appointed to
supervise it. I did not know that 1 was talk
ing for publication when I discussed that
matter with The Call reporter.
NEPOTISM IN THE LAST BOARD.
I think that I did ex-Director McEiroy an In
justice in singling him' out as an.example of
nepotism in the last board. The fact is that he
was only one of many offenders in that line.
One Director had two daughters appointed as
teachers, another had his sister apDointed, an
other had his son appointed, another had his
nephew appointed, another had his sister-in
law's salary raised from $80 to $125 a month
and appointed her to two other positions
drawing salaries, which gave her a raise from
960 to $1900 a yearâ that Is to say, she is re
ceiving pay for three different positions. Ido
not mean to say that there was corruption in
such appointments. It is possible that these
appointees were all worthy and capable peo
ple. I know nothing against them personally
and am ranking no charges. Ido not. how
ever, approve of the -system. The last Non
partisan convention exacted pledges from a'l
nominees for the position of School Director
that they would not appoint any relatives nor
vote lor the relatives of any other School Di
rector. But the Non-Partisan party wiil have
very little to say in this preseut board.
THE AUDITOR.
I have read the article by the Auditor, and
I am not anle to determine Just what he means
toady about the segregation of funds for school
purpose*". He does not, in terms, claim that
he, or the Board of Supervisors, or the Board
of Education has that power. He says: "They
(meaning the Board of Supervisors) have
ordered and published au allowance of
â 1, 000,000 lor school purposes and $200 000
for the Mis-ion High School. That is 'law
enough for an honest Board of Education and
an Auditor that will act under its spirit"
But suppose that it is not an honest Board of
Education. Does the Auditor mean to say
that he or the Board of Supervisors can pre
vent the Board of Education from spending
the entire appropriation in any manner that
it pleases, which is not contrary to the law?
The fact is, as I have already stated, that the
Board of Supervisors has no power to direct
the Board ol Education now money shall be
spent. It is true that, if the Board of Super
visors requested the Board of Education to
spend it In a certain manner, an "honest
Board of Education and an Auditor thai will
act under its spirit" may use the money for
the specific .purpose lor which it was appro
priated; but, if the Board of Education is not
"honest' within the meaning of the word as
used by th; Auditor, then the Auditor is help
less; and, ii the Board of Education hi
"honest," then the Auditor has nothing to do
but to approve the .demands as they come
along within the one-twelfth act. \
Ia a former interview the Auditor says that
he has the right to apportion school fund: ior
special purposes and professes to fiDd HUUor
ity in the statutes of 1871-72 and 1875-
Tne acts that he refers to are undoubtedly as
follows: . , ._ '7-7. ;
1. In the fourth section of the act of April _,
1872 (statute 1871-72, p. 846), is a requirement
that the Board of Education shall, before tht
third Monday of Marco in each year, report to
the Board of Supervisors an estimatt of the
amount that will be required to meet the cur
rent annual expense for the next year, in
which there shall be specified the amount re
quired for supplies, purchasing and procuring
sites, leasing rooms, erecting buildings, fur
nishing, c.c. This was simp >* ior mfoima
tion, and there was nothing in the act that
authorized the segregation of funds for anj ot
these purposes by the Board of Education or
that required the board to be limited to any
of tho amounts designated in that report
This act is partially printed in the conso.ida-,
lion act, but on page 174 of the edition com-,
piled by A. E. T. Worley is tound the following
note: "-sections 4, 5 and 0 relate to estimating
necessary annual expenses of schools and col
lecting tax therefor. Superseded by section 1,
act of April 3, 1870. supplement Xl'. "
Therefore the Auditor can find no authority
for the segregation ot school funds in the
statutes of 1871-72. This brings us then to
the statutes of 1875-70, in which he says he
finds autnority. By section 1 of the act of
April 3, 1870' (Stat. 1875-70. p. 9021 it is pro
vided "that Hie Board of Supervisors be au
thorized and empowered to levy and cause to
be collected, at the time and In the manner
of levying State and other City and County
taxes, the amount of tax determined and re
ported by the Board of Education" ; but there
is no direction therein and no authority given
to the Board oi Supervisors to design any
particular amount lor any particular pur
pose. - ; â¢
There is. therefore, but one school fund, and
when that school fund has been created by
the Board of Supervisors under the law it is
the right and duty of the Board of Education
io spend it for the maintenance and support
of the public schools under the provisions of
the law, without regard to any suggestions
from the Board of Supervisors us to the specific
purposes for which any -part of the school
mud may be designated..
THE PRESENT SITUATION. '.
The Board of Supervisors appropriated
?1."X)0,000 for the public schools. Practically
the Board of Supervisors requested that $200.
--000 of it be used for a Mission high school;
and, had- the Board of Education limited its
expenditures for other purposes to the remain
ing 000,000, then the *p-"00,000 could have
been used lor' the purpose intended. But
that was not done.. Salaries were raised, un
necessary teachers appointed and a general
system of reckless expenditure maintained in
ail departments. At the end of the J*rst hall
year the board had largely exceeded the limit
of 500,000 in its expenditures and the e/sccess
.must come out of the $200,000. The Board of
Education â  > aced in the position of spending
money for' .urge and unnecessary high
school build u 0 - hi the Mission, and deliber
ately paying . iherefor out of the teacners'
salaries. Between now and the Ist of next
July, before there can be another appropria
tion, the schools must either be closed, or else
a deficit of $100 00Q must. made up.
There is just u__.ut that amount left in the
Mission High school lund, and the question
is, Shall the teachers pay the bills' oui of their
salaries and the City nave an unnecessary
high school? .My opinion is that the teachers
are not suffering for another high school. Wo
have lour on hand already and there is abun
dant seating capacity for additional pupils in
them all. The majority of the teachers in the
department are industrious, hard-working
and capable and ought to be paid; and the
money is on hand to pay them. Tnose who
nave during the present fiscal year furn. Ned
supplies * under contracts ought also to be
paid; and the money is there fur them. If the
Auditor says that he will pay tae teachers
and that the contractors must wait, then he is
tatiug upon himselt the right to say who
shall be preferred creditors, and this he has no
authority to do. When the Board of Educa
tion approves a demand and it comes to the
Auditor there is only one thing that he can
consider, and that is whether or not it is a
legal demand. â¢ â¢. .-..._'/
The Auditor tries to make a left-hand fling
at the Board of Education of 1893-94. it he
would liKe to indulge iv a public discussion
as to she comparative work of that and the
succeeding board I shall be pleased to accom
modate him. -;â¢ 'â¢ â¢:,--..;
The present Board of Education is now con- |
sidering the question of retrenchmeat. There ;
is no amount of retrenchment now that will !
make up the deficiency of -{"100.000 except
closing the schools or withho. ding. the teach- j
ers' salaries, unless the Directors use the j
funds that are on hand. _. - .â¢ s . -.
CONTRACTS FOE THE MISSION HIGH SCHOOL.
It seems that ttie contractors for the Mission
High School building are taking desperate
chances. Thei? demands j cannot mature dur
ing this fiscal year, and by that time every
dollar of money in the treasury will be used
up. .Where then are they toget their money?
It may be that the hoard of Suyervisors will,
make' another appropriation, but possibly
the new- members may not see the necessity
for another high school. -. It certainly be
hooves all the taxpayers to make a protest
against such a- wanton waste of money. The
present contractors, therefore, are in a deli
cate position. There is no method by which
they can get the money set aside ior their
benefit, and by the time they have completed
their work ami are ready to present their bills
there will be no money to pay them. â¢
FINE RIFLE SHOOTING.
Valuable Prizes Offered by the
Manager of Schuetzen Park,
. . San Rafael.
The wet weather of yesterday did not
deter a number of enthusiastic marksmen
from participating in their favorite pas
time at the Schuetzen Park range. It was
the first monthly competition for the valu
able prizes offered by F. Schumann. He
offers four prizes, viz., $25, $15, $10 and $5
for the best ten tickets (3-inch bullseyes
only to count) of ten shots per man. with
MISS FttANCES WEYMAN.
j-trISS FRANCES WEYMAN IS ONE
â  B * of the pretty young ladies now visit-
ing friends in Hanford. As is well
known in Hanford, Miss Weyman left her
home in Omaha, Nebraska, in search of
good health. Before her arrival she was
but the ghost of her real self. Now she is
strong, brimful of energy and perfectly
beautiful. Although sue used several
bottles of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
her face showed no signs of a pimple, a
blood spot or a Sarsaparilla trade mark.
The reason is obvious. â  Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla, unlike the .iodide of potas-
sium faarsaparilla, contains only hemsâ
California herbs and herbs that will dry up
the facial blemishes and purify the blood
without throwing out spots on the face.
Listen to Miss Weyman: "You may tell
the manager of Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla that I am delighted with California
in general and with Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla in particular. I almost wish I
was a native. Don't you see what a great
thing it is to have people speak of your
own State as being great in health-restor-
ing qualities? Yes, when I return to
Omaha I will be sure to carry several bot-
tles of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and I
shall always praise the remedy, as it has
done me great good." The experience of
Miss Frances Weyman will be your ex-
perience if you try Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla. Don't allow a druggist to talk
you out of the "native Sarsaparilla"-
Joy s \ egetable Sarsaparilla.
No druggist owns stock in Joy's Vege- ,
able Sarsaparilla. Any druggist claim
to pay us advertising bills is a fraud

RYAN ON lUGILISM.
A Good Thing - hat It Will lie Confined
to tin- Sagebrush.
Tax Attorney E. B. Ryan ol the South
ern Pacific Railroad permitted his mind
to wander from tax title.-, deeds, claims
and records, and roam over the crossties
of the road into the State of Nevada,
where glove-contests for a purse have
been legalized by the Legislature and ap
proved by the Governor. He said:
"It strikes me that the legalizing of
prizefights in. Nevada is a good thing. In
a financial way it may be a good thing for
Nevada, and it Is a good thing for the en
tire country that pugilism is now relegated
to the sagebrush: The people who see
them will go there especially with tnat ob
ject, and the moral sensibilities of com
munities which don't want pugilist exhibi
tions will be shocked no longer.
"The passage of the prizefight bill" will
also have the effect of . considerably de
creasing long-range fighting in tho news
papers. It will, perhaps, also reduce the
number of actual contests, for there isa
place now where a fight can take place.
One man may say to another now, 'I can
lick you for money, maroles or chalk.'
One or tiie other of them will have to go
over into the sagebrush and light it out or
Eton talking.
"If other ev. ls which no amount of law
can suppress were confined to or.c place
where they could be watched, regulated
and restricted, methinks it would be better
lor our day and generation."
Thus ended the commentary.
Delay- Bonding the City.
'Ihe Merchants' Association has sent a peti
tion to the Board of Supervisors to withdraw
the petition sent to the Legislature for per
mission to bond the City Jn order to raise
unds to make a complete sewer system in this
City. That is, the body wishes the petition
withdrawn lor the present, as the time is not |
arrived for such mi action, and it would only,
result in confusion. When bonds are issued
for improvements it is contended tnat tne
matters of conduits for electric light, tele
graph.and telephone wires should be consid
ered and included;' It holds that all the facts
and data as to plans and-.' <*osts. should be de
termined by a commission and a board ot
competent engineers, and the request is made
that such a body be created assoon as possible.

Several important measures will "be
recommended by the Union League Club
for passage during this session of the Leg
islature. Among these will be one to
have the primaries of all political parties
held on the same day. It is thought that |
in this way the work â¢of professional po- I
litical fixers may be thwarted,, and the !
voters given a better show to express their
real desires. .â¢'â¢-' '
The political committee of the club held
a meeting Saturday afternoon. There
were present ex-Senator A. P. Williams,

Ford, Charles F. Bassett, Con O'Connor,
Colonel Miles, General S. W. Backus.
Major Meyers, H. G. W. Dinkelspiei and
General Fried rick. â¢â¢..'
The committee recommended that a
general meeting be called for next
Wednesday evening to consider not only
the primary law but other political mat
ters of importance. In reference to the
primary law it is the desire of the com
mittee that it be: regulated by the. same
penalties -and conditions as the general

The sermon, which was eloquent and
powerful, was delivered by Rev. Henry
Wood", S. J. He opened his address with
a realistic description of St. Paul's
journey to Damascus and the incidents of
his conversion. "One lesson which can
be drawn from. his life as a Christian," he
said, "is that true Christianity consists in
a devotion to the person of Jesus Christ,
our Lord, and the union of the soul with
Him. Considering Christianity under
this aspect it is clear that outside tht pale
of the Catholic church Christian spirit is
decaying. Men respect Christ as a man,
reverence Him as a teacher, but they, are
gradually losing sight of these two points
which have constituted the strength of
Christianity from the beginning.
./ "It was the understanding of this that
gathered together the first associates of
the congregation of St. Paul the Apostle.
They are united together by the firm reso
lution to give themselves without stint
to the knowledge and love of Christ, which
was the great characteristic of St. Paul.'.'

to join with them in their prayers to God
that this great gift might be granted them.

direction of Miss Collins, organist, ren
dered a programme of choice music.
After the first gospel Rev. Father Cara
her preached from the text, "Jesus know
ing that bis hour had come that he should
pass out of this world unto the father,
having loved his own who were in the
'world, he loved them unto the end."
The burden of the address was calcu
lated to make tne congregation realize the
immense love shown by the Lord in insti
tuting the eucharist and to point out their
obligation oi making a return of that love
in some degree.
In conclusion he said: "The Redeemer
earnestly desires to enter into your souls
and to make them your abiding place, and
you in turn should run forth to meet : him
with the swiftness with which the thirsty
stag "runs to drink out of the clear, limpid
stream."
Father H. H. Wyman of the Paulists

'The Sacred Synaxis of Sion."

Had Times and Debt Compel It to
Restrict Its B n fits to tbe
Present Inmates.'
The board of lady managers of tho
French Christian Union of California has
decided on account of the hard times
and a debt of $250 to close until further
notice the home for self-supporting con
valescent or unemployed girls and women.
During the last year there have been
sheltered under the roof ol "La Famille"
(The Family) not only French girls and
women, but also American, German and
British women, who could not be ad
mitted into other homes because their
age had passed the limit, or because their
convalescent state on leaving the hos
pitals required cares which ' those institu
tions do not take upon themselves to
give. This caused Mine. Marie. Marshall,
a member of the Red. Cross Society in
France, to start the work for convales
cents in "La ramille."
Convinced, through the good already
done, that such wont must continue tne
president of the French Christian Union
ol California has taken upon herself alone
the entire responsibility to keep this quiet
family-like shelter always open to loose
in need of such. The debt has been in
curred, through the admission into ' the
home of some very distressing cases which
have not been able to pay, board, which
have remained some length of time; also
because a means of helping this worK has
not been sufficiently understood by ladies
who come to ti.e employment office. This
office is kept after the rules of the Inter
national Union, the Friends of Young
Women, headquarters in Switzerland; the
girls pay no fee for getting a situation â
they must only bring references â but the
ladies must pay $1 for one year, and thus
become members of the office with all the
rights attached to it. Many will not agree
that it is the paity who can afford to pay
for helps that can also pay lor getting
them.
An appeal is made by Mme. Marshall
to all men and women -viio are anxious to
help the self-supporting when in distress,
regardless of creed or nationality. Thirty
subscribers giving mon hiy 50 cents, or
sixty giving 25 cent?, will insure the rent
of the home, for which a generous donor
gives the remaining $5 monthly. For a
time the inmates will be doing their own
light housekeeping under the care of a re
liable housewife. The convalescents will
always receive special attention. .
Any name, address and amount toward
the rent subscription can be sent to the
president of the French Christian Union
of California. 1520 Clay street.
A MUSICAL BURGLAR.

Willi Breaking Into the 1 eople'a
1 alace.
Otto Feusberg, a young man, was ar
rested last night by Policemen T. L.'Ryan
and Ed ODea on the charge of burglary.
He is accused of breaking into the People's
Palace about three weeks ago and stealing
a drum, two drumsticks, a trombone and
about : $25 worth of poker-chips. The
stolen property has been recovered.
Feusberg was one time a bellboy in the
Windsor Hotel. Then he became a clerk
for William Nicol, real estate agent, sM]_
California street. He was discharged from
that potation about two months ago," and
since then Nicol has employed an expert
to examine his books, and although the
examination is not yet finished over $300 is
unaccounted for. It is probable that an
additional charge of forgery will be pre
ferred against him by Nicol.

Blocked Out in the
Pearce Mine.
Shipments of ioo Tons a Day and
About 200 Men. Employedâ Will

Anions the recent arrivals here was
John Brockman, the widely known pio
neer, banker, Indian-fighter and mine
owner of Arizona, and Professor R. A. F.
Penrose of the chair of economic geology
and mining in the Chicago University.
They are the principal owners of the cele
brated Pearce mine, thirty ' miles north
of Bisbee. Professor Penrose, who is a
brother of the lately elected United States
Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania, who
succeeded Cameron, is president of.the
mine and Mr. Brockman is general man
ager. m%t_i:
The Pearce is one of the latest developed
big mines of the country. It was discov
ered by a man of the name of Pearce,' and
Messrs. Penrose and Brockman bought it
last May in this City. It is said they paid
$250,000 for it, most all of which was taken
out ol the mine after they took possession.
Extensive bodies of ore have since been
developed, and the property is estimated
at several millions. The gentlemen are
here on a business trip, and will ere long
put a large plant ol machinery on the
mine, besides an extensive mill for treat
ing the ore, which is both gold and silver.
' The ore is at present being freighted by
horse and mule teams for fourteen miles
to Cochise, a station on the Southern Pa
cific Railroad. There is a heavy product
from the mine. â 
I â¢ "Our ore is being sent to Pueblo for
| treatment," said the professor. "We ship
approximately from 2(500 to 3000 tons a
month, or in the neighborhood of 100 tons
a day. .We have shipped more than that.
Nothing is shipped that does hot go $50 or

this is not all ore. Tne shipping ore will

â¢ "Our 'working * force, including the
miners, freighters and others required,
1 amounts to about '200 men. Hitherto the
ore has been bandied by the use ot horses
and whims, but we have been enabled to
accomplish a great deal in this way.

J. L. BARDWELL'S PRESENT
A ' Fine Collection of Animal
Paintings Given to the
Park Museum.
Swimming Races and High Diving
at Sutro Bathsâ The Chutes
Closed.
'. The wet and dismal weather yesterday
prevented pleasure-seekers from enjoying
the park and Cliff House. 'No one was
stirring in the park except an Occasional
horseman out exercising a trotter. ' .
In the park museum there is a new at
traction in the fine collection of water-'
color paintings of birds and animals
which were recently presented by John
L. Bardwell. This collection of sixty-four
finely executed little pictures- were painted
by Henry yon Ainmond, who is an artist,
a naturalist and an anatomist. He is con
sidered a very fine animal painter, and
some of his pictures of horses were painted
by special order of the Sultan of Turkey.
He has also done some good work for the
Khedive of Egypt.
In making these portraits of birds and
animals he copied them irom life in the
zoological gardens of Europe. One of the
finest of them represents a black leopard
of Java, which is a very rare animal.
Judges of art say he has the power of
making his figures stand out in a very
life-like way. '
At the Sutro Baths there was some spir
ited switnmine races. The'tifly-yard race
for boys was won by F. Clough. The 100
--yard race, oi en to all, was well contested,
and J. A. Jackson reached the goal first.
The next leature on the programme was
the high diving irom a sixty-foot pedestal
by Professor O. Schulte. The fourth was
an amusintr aquatic performance by R. B."
Cornell and Edward Empey. representing
one of the San Francisco notice force and
a plundering German from "Teh'amny
avenue," causing much merriment. The
obstacle race, whicn was a swim through
five sriSall tanks and a climb over the divi
sions, was the prettiest performance of
â 11, and the prizj was cai ned off by Otto
Schulte. ',â¢ '
The Chutes were closed on account of
the bad weather. They exnect to have
big crowds and a gay time there this week
with the Chinese. Thirty-live thousand
invitations have been issued to the Celes
tials to come out to the Chutes for their
New Year's frolics.

THE PICKPOCKET'S TRICK.
Like the pickpocket in Oliver Twist, the Examiner is lustily shouting "Stop thief,"
lin order to divert public attention from itself and from it 1- discovered and undiscov
| ered felonies. lis Long Green manager evidently overlooks the fact that when a crook
| who has already to his account a prior conviction is again accused of an attempt to
' commit blackmail, it is not a. sufficient defense to allege that the District Attorney is
guilty of something or other. :.././;â¢" * . .'.* â¢
The question in which the public is interested does not refer to the accuser, but to
the accused, and whenever a felon who has served his term for a crime comes again
before the bar, his ' past offense is rightly weighed against the presumption of his
innocence. ' " â¢
This is peculiarly true in a legal as well a** in a moral sense of the course of extor
tion and of its most notable modern and local adept, the San Francisco Examiner.
j It has once been convicted upon undoubted proof, and upon its own confession, of
blackmailing the Southern Pacific Company out of $22,000 under that pledge of silence
which lurks within the blackmailer's promise ol "fair treatment." It has been a
matter of current rumor for months that other large corporations in anil out of Cali
fornia have secured immunity from assault by a similar arrangement and by the
regular payment of various sums. fjm\^m^ 'â ".:, ' J-i-'J:-
It might well be supposed that these levies would be sufficient to maintain a
newspaper conducting its internal affairs with a business honesty not extended to its
outside relations, but it seems that this has not been the case with the Examiner. In
fact it could hardly be expected that it would be in view of the theories of life and of
business which its owner and its "Lone Green" manager are known to prefer.
Mr. Hearst never earned an honest dollar, while Long Green Lawrence never be
lieved that an honest dollar was worth earning, or that the Examiner ought to east dis
credit upon the principles of its owner by attempting to earn it. The public mind is
quite Well saturated with the.idea that the Examiner never does anything with an
honest and unselfish intent, and that whether, it promotes a charity or assails an in
dustry, a sordid if not criminal motive is t' c mainspring of its action.'
''â¢'. This being the case, it will not avail the Examiner in the present instance to cry
"stop thief "at honest men nor to assert that the gas and water companies are guilty
and, therefore, ought not to be protected against blackmail. In the eye of ' the law
and in common prudence the blackmailer is regarded as guilty of a dastardly crime
even though he may be threatening to make public the truth regarding the victim he
has selected for his prey. 7.7 â¢â¢'..- -
The experience of society has proven that the wretch who makes commerce of an
insecure concealment of another's secret offending is the more dangerous criminal of
the two for the reason that if successful to-day his selected victim of to-morrow may
be an innocent person whose fear of notoriety will impel him to the payment of black
mail in order to prevent the publication of a lie." â â¢.â '.'
It is of the utmost importance to those who.have property interests in California
or who have reputations to protect, that they give present heed to these things. The
Examiner has once been convicted of extortion, and has frequently been suspected of
: a repetition of its offense. "...
It is a matter of rumor, which reaches across the continent, that the wasteful and
reckless career in journalism of its owner is about to end for lack of' further funds
from his father's estate to spend. It isa well-known, fact that for the past year the
Examiner has run an unreined course in the publication of every fraud, and .fake, and
folly which might for the moment attract the public eye, regardless of the truth of its
articles or the consequences of its acts. â â¢ -'.-
It is more than a matter of rumor that the Eastern supply of funds to the local
staff has been cut off and that, true to the instincts of their- Long Green chief,
the black flag of â¢ piracy has been' hoisted to the Examiner masthead. The
support ; which it . is openly . givin** to â  every ' cinch bill before

Commission; the assault which it is directing against every local corporation which it
suspects may have reason to buy its silence; the daily repeated misrepresentation of

Stateâ all indicate that it is out foe boodle, and that by a bold and extensive system of

THE NASHVILLE EXPOSITION.
At the meeting of the California Press
Association, held at Yallejo, â¢ a resolution
.vas unanimously adopted favoring an ap
propriation by the Legislature of $10,000 to
make an exhibit of the products of Cali
fornia at the Nashville Exposition. A
hill providing for the appropriation has
been passed by the State Senate and is !
now before the Assembly. It should ba I
promptly adopted there and approved by j
the Governor. *: Â','â¢'
The appropriation called for will be in j
no sense an extravagance. The Nashville
Exposition will be the greatest of its kind
in the United States this year and one of \
the. best ever, held in the Union. Every
State will be represented at it and the I
leading commonwealths will have build
logs of their own, in which displays of
the best productions of their industry and ]
their resources will *be made. -â  It is
altogether rightand fitting that California \
should be represented at such an exposi- i
-*tion. . We cannot afford to be counted out J
at any gathering where our sister States j
are assembled.
In addition to the State pride which
impels us to make as good display as
any other State at an exposition of this
kind, there are further reasons for the ex
hibit to be drawn from questions of profits '
and advantage. . The Southern States i
are at the present time offering big in- I
ducements to settlers from the North. ;
Large numbers of home-seekers from the I
colder and more crowded States will un- j
doubtedly visit Nashville in order to see
where they can find homes for themselves i
where the climate is milder and the soil !
more fruitful.
California, also, desires to reach these
people. In this respect she is a rival of i
the South. She should . make a good j
showing for herself at ah exposition
where all the Southern States will be !
conspicuously represented, and give
ample evidence of her superior oppor
tunities and advantages for all who are
seeking homes or investments for capi- !
tal. .
j The -Press Association gave the subject
lull consideration before indorsing the
| proposition for the proposed exhibit. It
is well, known that the editors of the
State are not inclined to look with favor
! on anything which involves a useless ex
: penditure of public money. Their decla
j ration in favor of the appropriation is
.the best commendation it could possibly
receive. The passage of the bill will be
regarded favorably in every section of the
State, . and there can bt* little question
that if a good exhibit is' made we shall
draw to California thousands of immi
grants who otherwise would make homes
in the South.
KANSAS AND THE EAST.
Governor Leedy of Kansas has the satis
.faction of knowing that his inaugural ad- j
â  dress has giyen rise to a wider discussion
than that of any other Governor in the
Union.. This was not due to its length, al- â 
though it was one of the longest on record,
! but to the manner in which he defended
Kansas against the attacks of Eastern
qities. _SZ_Ei
. It will he remembered that of late years
it has been the fashion in the East to de
nounce Kansas as a land of ignorance, ec
centricity and dishonesty. In reply to
these reiterated criticisms, the Governor
said that while -in the great cities of the
East: ' '-.-. J'j'j:
"Children linger in the streets untaught, ' j
except in the lore of the pavement; un
fed, except at the hand of charity; un- !
housed, except in the kennels they dispute j
with creatures scarcely less miserableâ tbe !
commonwealth of Kansas, rejoicing in a
.public school system; which is the most !
grateful heritage we received Irom our '
fathers and the best legacy we can leave to
! our children, finds ample houseroom and :
schoolroom for every Kansas child, and
, for such straggling waifs as come to ns for
I aid in Kansas, except .those birds of pas
â¢| sage which flit by us, grim reminders of
! old communities.
â¢ The truth of. this assertion has goaded |
the Eastern critics into making various !
kinds of reply. ' Some. are flippant, some j
are spitciul, and some, we are glad to say, |
are wise. The flippant ones seek to evade Â«
the charges made by the Governor by
j mocking at the wealth of Kansas and de
| claring that her schools have not enabled
her people to pay their debts. The spite- '
ful ones retort that the Governor's mes
sage is only another evidence that Kansas
farmers hate the East. The wise, ones
however, admit that' Governor Leedy is
right and call upon the large cities the

AID TO AGEIOULTUBE.
Some interesting statements of the
amount of Government aid to agriculture
are made in a preface which J. Sterling
Morton, Secretary of Agriculture, has re
cently written for a book for farmers
which is soon to be published by James C.
Ambrose of Evanston, 111. â¢â¢ From these it
appears that whatever else the farmers may
have to complain of, they certainly cannot
deny the generosity of the Governmeni in
endeavoring to assist their industry.
; During the last .thirty years, the Secre
tary says, the United States has by enact
ment given to farmers between 2,000,000
and 3,000,000 farms averaging over eighty
acres each. It has during the last ten
years founded and maintained agricultural
colleges and experiment stations in every
State and Territory. Tbe appropiiation
for - experiment stations is $750,000 an
nually, and about $1,100, 000 every year is
taken Irom the treasury for colleges of
agriculture and mechanic arts in which
free tuition is provided and.courses of in
struction in agriculture are given. Be
sides about $000,000 in interest is annually
received by the different-States and Terri
tories from land-g'ant funds held in trust
by them from . proceeds of the land act of
1862.
. Attention is called to the fact that the
Government, passing by commerce and
manufacture in its favoritism of farming
interests, has created an executive depart
ment of agriculture which costs more than
two millions per annum. In addition to
all this Uncle Sam sends out every year â¢
several hundred tons of garden seeds for
free distribution.
This is certainly a showing of which
America may be proud and which farm
ers should appreciate. . As a result of this
munificent encouragement our farming i*
the finest in the world. In addition to
feeding and clothing our own people bet
ter than tho inhabitants of any other por
tion of the globe are fed and clothed, the
farmers of Ihe United States ship abroad
a surplus amounting to over $500.000
each year. .
The record proves that while the Gov
ernment cannot be expected to make
everybody prosperous by direct enact
ment, it can by wise laws and judicious
expenditures open a way for prosperity
and extend a helping hand to individual
effort, which will' make success far more
surely and widely attained. It is also clear
that since the Government has done so
much for farmers they should gratefully
remember it, and cheerfully assist other
industries in obtaining the favorable
legislation .and aid, they need from the
Government. *
COAST hX^HANGES.
â  The Monterey Sew Era has cut its Subscrip
tion price in twain, and for a dollar a year is
j going to furnish its readers with a paper us
| bright and newsy as ever it issued at the $2
rate. :-:.;â '
The Downievllie (Sierra County) Enterprise
has entered Its second year and joyfully
speaks of its excellent prospects for the future.
The paper looks very comely in a new dress of
.type.
The Lemoore Leader, next to the oldest paper
in Kings County, Is very happy at the begin
ning of its ninth year, as it has just, been
recognized for the, first time as the county
official paper. ' . . "
. The Fresno Watchman has completed its first
year and proudly announces that its Success
as a weekly publication has Induced its own
ers to make plans . tor ; the issuance of a daily
in the near future.
. Published-, weekly at Alcatraz Island Is a
lively little paper called 77*. lap. It would
appear from its columns that existence over
at Alcatraz is not at all dull. The prisoners
have an orchestra and give frequent entertain
ments, and the dances in the prison mess hall
seem to bo highly pleasurable affairs.
The Pctalumian has lost itself, so far asname
is concerned, in the Petaluma Weekly Budget
The paper has been - enlarged and the new
editor, Frank H. Snow, proposes to give his
readers just a plain budget of news, without
political frills. He appears to understand his
business, and that is saying quite a good deal.
George F. Weeks has sold the Bakersfleld
Caiifornian to Alirea Harrell, who will J en
deavor to keep the paper up to its.present
high standard. In one respect, however, the
new proprietor will inaugurate an important
change, in making the tah'fornian Democratic
in politics. The' paper has hitherto made its
political abode in the field of the elect.
The Promoter is the name of a new paper in
Williams, Glenn County. The editor, H. D.
de Gna, declares that his aim will be to redeem
the fair name of Glenn County from the odium
engendered by the faction fights of the past.
He will know neither clique nor faction,
neither ring nor anti-ring, but will work for
the common good of all. The Promoter pre
lents a clean and neat appearance.' >Â»â¢=Â£'
The proprietors of El Barbareno, the cleverly
edited Santa Barbara weekly, have decided to
Issue once a month "a beautiful illustrated
magazine to be styled El Barbareno Illustrated
Monthly." The scope of the new work will be
National in its character, although the special
object will be that of concentrating attention
upon this glorious coast section, with its su
perb climate and remarkable resources.
Says the Fresno Republican: A few days ago
J. D. Culp of Gilroy, the well-known tobacco
grower, visited Fresno with the view of ascer
taining whether there was any soil in the
county adapted to ' tobacco-growing. He . did
not have far to look, for be found the best
kind of soil not far from this city. Since
Fresno County has soil adapted to the growing
of Havana tobacco. it is to be hoped that -the
crop will soon be given a trial here. It would
be a great source of profit to our people if suc
cess were attained.
" The San Mateo Leader observes that the
future prospects of that section "are brighter
than those of any other section of the State.
The Call has announced that the Valley road
would make China Basin, on the Potrcro, the
terminus; that to reach that -point the road
would approach this section through the Pa
checo Pass, below Gilroy, thence northward
along the' westerly shore of the bay to San
Francisco. San Mateo will be benefited be
yond measure. This action, once begun by
the Valley road people, will undoubtedly
hasten the construction of the double-track
bay-shore cutoff, and this point will then
enjoy an hourly service, which, in addition to
the benefit ot being on a main transconti
nental line, will give us' a prestige that will
prove a Godsend to this section Those who
can' look into' the future and reason intelli
gently agree that San Mateo is a place with a
brilliant future."
NEWS OF FOKEIGN NAVIES.
Twenty additional torpedo-boat destroyers,
with a speed of 33 knots, are to be ordered
for the British navy during the present year.
It is reported that Orders for 275,000 horse
power in Belleville boilers are in hand for the
British navy, and all the vessels ordered dur
ing 1890 will be fitted with this type. : "â " .
The Russian naval programme contemplates
an expenditure of 800,000,000 roubles, equal
to 0,000,000, up to 190(5. This Implies a
large number of new vessels and a strengthen
ing of its fleets in the Baltic, in the Black Sea
and the Paclflc. A fourth station is to be
established in the Arctic, as & port has been
discovered on the northern coast, wnich is to
be connected with Finland by railway.
The Pomone, a 20-knot cruiser, is shortly
to be begun at Sheerness dockyard, and is to
ba completed for commission In twelve
months. The ship will have a length of 300
feet, 36 feet 6 Inches beam and a displacement
of 2135 tons. The machinery will develop
7000 horsepower under forced draught ana
5000 under natural draught. Her armament
will consist of eight 4-inch quick firers, eight
3-pound Hotchklss guns, two .45-inch Maxim
guns and two 14-inch torpedo tubes.
Thirteen out of the nineteen steamers of the
Russian volunteer fleet were at Sebastopol on
January 7. ready for any emergency that might
arise, to carry an army corps to any part of
the Bosphorus. Two additional are building
on the Ty'ne and three more will be ordered
during the present year. The net earnings of
the fleet for the past year amounted t0.f1,
--663,000, which will be expended on new ships.
The Government pays this fleet a liberal sub
sidy for the transportation of convicts to Sag
hallen.of which it carries about .1200 each
season at the rate of $116 for each, and in ad
dition it is paid $340,000 suosidy yearly. It
is the intention of the company to raise the
fleet to thirty steamers, which In time of war
may be converted into fast armed cruisers.'
Thirty million dollars is to be expended In
improvements to the Devonport dockyard. At
present Keyham and I'evonport, on the banks
of the river Thames, cover an area of 145 acres,
aud the scheme contemplates the utilization
of 100 acres in the vicinity for dockyard pur
poses. There will.be a tidal basin of 35JÂ£
acres of 1550 feet length, 1000 feet wide and
55 deep below the coping stones. Leading
into this basin there will be three docks of
larger dimensions than any yet built, which
will give Devonnort ten docks, second only to
Portsmouth, which baa fifteen docks. Already
$10,000,000 has been expended in dredging
ami $20,000,000 more will be expended during
the next ten years in building docks and work
shop.Â«, which will make Devonport the largest
naval arsenal in the world.
Spain, in a feeble way, has endeavored to
increase her navy. It has purchased from
Ansaldo & Co., snip-builders near Genoa, the
armored cruiser Giuseppl Garibaldi, which
was intended for Italy. She is of 6500 tons
displacement, 388 feet length, 59 feet beam
and 23 feet 7 inches draught. Her horse
power is 13,000, and she is expected to make
20 knots. The armament is 'two 8-inch
lifles, ten 6-inch and four 5-inch rapid-Arc
guns and .twenty-four"small caliber rapid-fire
and machine guns. The ship is to be deliv
ered at Barcelona in February. Another
cruiser has been ordered from Ansnldo, to be
delivered in fifteen months. At the home
dockyards two new 'vessels have b?cn
launched recently, and there is much activity
in preparing ships for sea and collecting war
material.

DEFECT IN THE NEW ARS.Y R.FLE
. Philadelphia Ledger.
. Since it is conceded that the battles of the
future are. likely to be fought at extremely
long range, because the deadly effect of mod
ern artillery will not permit combatants to
get very near each other, the unreliability of
the Krag-Jorgensen rifle at distances of 800
yards and over seems j to. be a fatal defect in it.
Ever since this rifle was adopted for use in the
army there have been adverse criticisms 6f it
In both official reports and unofficial remarks,
but the finding, of General Ruger's inspector,
that it is, in some respects, inferior to even
the old Springfield rifle, should command seri
ous attention. - It would be . very costly to
fully provide the United States army. with a
weapon which wou.d fail in the event of action.

the society has increased and although
the subscriptions have also increased , he.
finds himself handicapped in his work.for

. There should be at least $3000 a year given
to this society. There are wealthy people in
this City wuo could afford that, amount out. of
their pinmoney every year for the saving of
the helpless little ones whom; I receive irom
the custody of their unnatural parents,
whom I find steeped in vice through their ex
cesses in drink, and immorulitv; their; so
called homes filthy and their .children naked

The pagans are thoroughly -convAiced
that the dark alleys, narrow recesses and

who died in sin. According to the rubric

warned his -hear.ers'th'at-thff remedies he
had to propose '.were. '.not net, and
that they could not. be expected to be
applied all at once. There is no royal

competitive system, and mentioned two
agencies which must be used to open' the
way for a belter systemâ a better,educa
| tion and a better ' religion.- In.the im
i provement of education he laid special
| stress on the need of putting industrial
| training on an-" equality with the more
purely intellectual education.'.' The .im
j provement of religion he holds must be
a teaching of the doctrine of brotherhood
in a more practical Sense than is now
done. : Christ planted himself clearly oh
the principle of fraternity..', Current re-.
. ligion is formed mote from the teachings
' of St. Paul than of Christ. '.
Co-operative industries, profit sharing,
. and the doing away with the , system of
selfish competition, "is a remedy the speak
er prophesied will neutralize .Â° indus

While not distinctly avowing an ac
: ceptance of. /the. single tax doctrine of
Henry; George, the â¢ pastor looks for- a
| remedy of present evils by some similar
â  method of breaking up; land monopoly,
and letting the people have the use. of
land free as the use of air. "Let the hands
have acres and the acres have hands. Her
bert Spencer, John Stuart Mill, the his-,
torian Froude, tie scientist Wallace, the
commentator B ackstone, deny that land
can be property in the sense that movable
things are property." -.. The old Jewish
â law that. prevented great land monopolies
by compelling its return to the people at
the end of every fifty years was cited with
â¢ : approval. -H

, fated by what has recently been done in

' .The thieves that planned the robbery
had arranged for one of their confederates
to go .to the firebox mentioned. There,
with a huge bowlder, he smashed in the

This brought out the engines in the sur
rounding section, -J Under" the stringent
rales of the Fire Department every man
attached to the company must report at
the box from which the alarm comes, and
this, 'too, without any loss of time. ' Some

doors of the engine-house as the wagons :
roll off on the run...' ..' â â¢â  -' 'â¢;' : .~â'. '
On the return of the men to their houses

found turned inside- out, -.while many
articles of clothing would missing. â '.:=â¢. â¢
â¢ The thefts, have been reported to the
officials of the Fire Department and by
them to police headquarters, but so far
the culprits have, not been caught.

their inability. to meet tneir monthly pay
ments for the necessaries of life,. and in
this way the thefts have been let out to
others not pledged , by. strict secrecy. â¢
Saturday being payday with' the fire de
partment, the thieves who concocted the
raid on the men's pocket at Engine Com
pany 29 on Brannan and Eleventh streets
yesterday morning,, when the box was
smashed open; did ..not .go away empty
handed, much to the lamentations of the
hard-worked men and their families, who
were le t short of their scanty stipend in
consequence. â¢
The two false alarms turned in yester
day afternoon from boxes 98 and 56. were
believed to have been prompted by a sim
ilar motive to that of 238, .after which the
men of engine 29 were fobbed.: :".'â¢.
The victims of the scheme complain bit
terly of their loss, and urge upon : their
friends in Sacramento the necessity, of
putting the .department on a full-paid
footing, with provisions that one of their
number be permitted to remain on. guard
while the company is out on duty.!.
A fire alarm was turned ih about 12:20
o'clock this morning from box 296, situ

be discovered, and it is supposed to have

Divine " Allegory.
The . Rev. J. S. David, minister 'of the
Third S"aredepbor*;ian Society, commenced
a series of doctrinal lectures at Washing
ton Hall, Red Men's building, . 320 Post
street, yesterday morning:.' .\-
He said the Mosaic account of the flood
has been the subject of a vast amount of
speculation and comment. Some regard
it as a myth pure and simple; others re
gard it as a partial myth having grown
out of a physical catastrophe, - which
might have been the sinking of the conti
nent At.antis. The popular belief among
Christians is that the story is literally
true in al^its historic details, having been
written by divine inspiration.
Tnere are those who believe that it was
written first by one of the- wise sages of
high antiquity and contains a deeply
esoteric meaning. The new churcii
claims that the sacred scriptures were
written Dy divine inspiration, and there
fore contain infinite depths ol meaning
veiled in allegory. According to Sweden

The real estate market has been rather quiet
during the week as far as important sales are
concerned, though there continues to be con
siderable inquiry for good investment prop
erty. â¢'â¢;â  ."â¢.- . s'f . â 'â "â¢'. '
. The present is an excellent time to buy land
in San Francisco.. At such a time as this,
when there is no wild excitement in the air,
and when prop is valued at exactly what
it is worth, there,is an excellent opportunity
for judicious capitalists to look over the field,
and, getting a little out of the regular, rut, in
vest 'their money in properly that has not yet
become high-priced, but Is likely to be so in
the near tiiture. . 'Â§"fsÃÂ£JL.&i
, The opportunities which are now presented
In' this City for purchasing houses on easy
installments have undoubtedly, to a certain
extent, interfere.! with the renting business,
as there is within '-.the average American a
strong desire to own his own home, however
humble it may be.- . ;â¢"
The facilities for acquiring homes In San
Francisco, which until a few years ago were
confined' to those in possession of considerable
means, are now within the reach of everyone j
who has a few hundred dollars and Is in re
ceipt of a regular salary such as enables him
to pay a fair rent. Sometimes it is even
possible for a man. to buy a house and lot
without paying; anything down. . â 
In such ca c ei, however, as may naturally be
; supposed, the property offered is not of t he
I most desirable description, consisting gener
ally of small lots in out-of-the-way parts of
town, which the owners have -been, unable to
dispose of in any other way.
When, however, a man can buy a comforta
ble house and lot by ring a couple of hun
dred dollars down and about as much monthly
as the rent would amount to, there is no great
cause for complaint. * It is true that the inter
est during the early years, together with the
insurance - and taxes adds materially to the
payments which have to be made at iirst, and
for this reason owners who sell in such a man
ner should, when so desired, spread payment
over as long a term of year- as possible. '*. .-
The real estate brokers are tindiug encour
agement in the prospects ot increased immi
gration toÂ» the State owing to the active work
of .Dow*rful colonization organizations.
â¢ A great hindrance ip the legitimate coloni
zation enterprises of this Slate has "been- the
: disposal in Eastern and. European markets of
comparatively worthless lands of California
I at the same ngure at which good lands have
; been offered here. ".-.â â¢ â¢.'-'
There is no more hopeful sign in California
! to-daythan the lact that all over the State
i large holdings of land are being divided up
and sold to settlers in tracts of a few acres each.
It is, only a few years sinee -one of tho chief
I obstacles to immigration to this Slate wis the
I difficulty to secure small farms of. desirable
land in localities. All is changed now.
j Some of the largest tracts have been divided
I up ana colonized; others are now being sold '
off. ".-..*â¢ . â¢ Â

the level 'of a farce an l .elevates have to

... This stale of affairs has been proved .to
' exist during the past week. so far.as mu
nicipal politics is concerned, ' and -the
struggle, for every. office 'â '. will be made on
personal ra ther than on party lines.
This decadence party fealty was never
so- manifest before, but :it; is not hard to
find a reason for ii. It is due. to the lack
of party leaders. With a firm, disinter
ested.hand at .the hem of either of the
three recognized parties all tendency
toward political anarchy could be quickiy
dispelled and. the wanderers brought bacK
into the fold. This absence of abe lead
- ers applies to air-parties,' and.' there .is i not
to-day a political leader in Oakland Take
the -Republicans. George =. Pardee -.leads
one-. element; Fred. A. Campbell another,
George de G-ol.i'a another, while W. H.
Friend, Captain Thomas arid, others' each

The .Populist's are worse off than any.
A. A. Bretz has declared that it is impos

D "-unison has lost the grip he acquired

the help of .the remnant of his Bryan
Army and Navy Free-silver League, and
R.-.v. S. Goodenough.. and City Attorney
Piersol are \ the only .two. actively trying

are .ike a cr.o.vd of sailors hauling on a
rope. with. no boatswain's whistle. to har
monize their efforts, and ; wise' is - he' who
iin prophesy "the complexion. oi : the next
Council and Board of Education.'
H. O. Trpwbridce, State . Commissioner
to the Hamburg Horticultural Exposition,
which opens next- .May; is meeting with
an '.experience that. is novel to him.
Whenever he .sets forth the value of such:
an opportunity.' to a. horticuitiir'ai State,
such; as California, he: always hears the
fcuggestion' that the trip will be a pleasant
one -for him and that .he." has a' .-good
thing.'-* Ho is rather tired of this, and
when' asked yesterday if he .was .-doing
well he made the following reply:
. -"This is the most- thankless:' task ever
undertaken. -For three monfhs 1 have
given all my time to stir up interest in this'
great exhibit and it has been a labor of
love entirely, it I go to Hamburg I ex
pect to have my expenses paid, but no
more, and still I meet people on every hand
who treat me as tnough 1 were an advent
urer planning, for some pleasure trip.
One. man told me that such soft things
as I had were not to be fourd every day ;
another said it would be a- very peasant
trip I was 'arranging' for, and another
party said that those having in charge the
Stale exhibit should certainly pay for the
material to exhibit. And. this, when lam
making terms with railroads to carry ex
. hibits free and Irving to' tret small sums
from each county to pay the necessary ex
penses. ..If this be the rewaru for showing
a -little disinterested spirit- t'ne'n
many things in' California -..hitherto ob
scure to me are made plath."'..
â¢â  . The cry for Greater Oakland is a good
one. This city needs -to â¢be greater!- in
every sense of the word. It needs more
â¢ territory on which to expand and more
greatness of civic pride, more greatness in*
her politics, more greatness in the men
who would mold people's opinions, and
â¢ more greatness when" questions arise con
cerning th 6 welfare, of the municipality.
â¢For* years Oakland has suffered because
,'lhe outside world ha- looked upon it as a
â¢'.city, of-" cranks â political r and jeltgiou's,
and ...of- .all'- petty -minded people â
aiid this idea has been generously circu
lated by rival cities. ," .â  â¢: "".
'To. some extent this has been deserved,
; but with the -new era. this should ail' be
â¢changed, and Oakland should be as great
.in heart as in .body."- Nobody .wants any
. more of .Oakland as 'she. has been ;'; there
â¢ was, in fact, too much, of its 'kind. .But
with aliberated water front, the -certainty'
that* cbmpeiirig railroad- will soon be
- here.and a desire on the part of thousands
" of- people who live in the outlying dis
tricts 10 become an integral : portion of
Greater Oakland, there is a hope that the
â  indifference and stagnation -of the' ; past
-..may never return, and that this city may

The Federal Labor Union, which was
reorganized two weeks ago, objected to
, the. principle of the Grovt -street lines in
asking its men to sign a pledge of total
abstinence from -intoxicating liquors, and
to admit that they consider being seen
coming ou. of a saloon as a valid reason
for dismissal.'. .- -.:â¢â â 
At its meeting last-night .'.the following
report from the committee of ten was' read
and unanimously adopted': ' ' '\.-
â It is an insult to .employes 'to-put- up signs
asking the. public to. report any cases of inci
vility, and suggests 'that carmen are notable'
to behave themselves unless coerced into de
cent behavior. A man should be .presumed to
be a gentleman until he proves that "he. Is not,
and then he should be dismissed. It is no
valid cauie lor dismissal because* amain may
be seen .'leaving a saloon. Such mi idea is un-
American^ The same City Council that gives
franchises ,to ; street-'- railroad- .companies
granted licences to saloon-keepers, and the
lf-tter p*y more for the privilege than, the
street-railroad companies. : ..
As a part of the .traveling public we object
to act at the request of street-railroad com
panies as spies upou their employes, be ieving
-that- if we are .wronged or our ; wives and
daughters insulted we are Intelligent enough
*Â°,?. eek Proper redress in the proper quarter. -.
We deprecate the use to which the pledge is
being put on the system controlled by F. M.
bmitn, as it has a tendency to make the em-,
ployes adopt something of which they do not
conscientiously approve, so = that tbey may
continue, to earn a living for their families."' :
" It was moved and adopted -that "this
union heartily condemns the action of the
.City Council in the matter of the garbage "
crematory, as it gives the crematory com
pany a monopoly of the garbage of the
city, thus depriving some- .hard-working
men of a chance to make a living." It
was stated that .the crematory company,
through their lrancbise.-are forcing scav

CARR '99 AND HASKELL '97, WHO ARE OUT FOR THE
CAPTAINCY OF BERKELEY'S ELEVEN.
BERKELEY, Cai., Jan. 31.â The absorbing topic of conversation in the student body at
Berkeley Is the question why the election of a football captain for the season of 1897 aid
not taxe place yesterday afternoon, as had been previously and definitely announced, and
which of the two candidates now in the field will finally win out. It is generally con
ceded that the election was allowed to go by the board on political grounds. But the real
reason lor the incomplete list has become apparent. The students regard with special
significance the fact that one of the two candidates is a fraternity man, while the other is a
"non-f rat," and that the six who are supporting the fraternity candidate are likewise,
fraternity men, while the remaining seven are of the "non-frat" contingent. During the
two months* campaign for the captaincy of the 'Varsity, which has come to be regarded as
the most coveted position in any of the student organizations, four men have been prom
inently mentioned for the place. These are Carr, who played â¢ center in "the
last/ intercollegiate; . Haskell,-- who played quarter after Kennedy had .broken
; his hose, -Hall, halfback, and Hutchinson, who held down the left end In the 1895 inter
collegiate. â¢ All, these men, especially '. the first three mentioned, have been- working
for the place mote or less vigorously ever since the big game, and it was not until two â¢
or three days ago that Hall and Hutchinson retired to leave the place for Carr and Has
kell to fight for.. brought gridiron fame with him when be came to Berkeley,
having been a. star player on the.formidable Belmont eleven; but Haskell's football ex
perience, though he is now a senior, has been confined wholly to the Berkeley field, his .
first wprk'havlpg.beeri done at end and quarter in 1895. -".Last fall he captained- the second
eleven from his position at quarter through practically the whole train lag- season. ' His
qualification's for captain lie largely in his genei alshiD and his rapid method' of play,
â¢Trie next" date announced for the election to take place is the coming' Saturday afternoon. .."
Candidates for manager have-begun' to announce their names. Though the election Wil
not take place for a month or more three men are In the field. ' They are: , Reinhardt' '97,
the present manager; Track Captain Everett Brown '98 and Allan Chiclrerlng '98. ' * .

BERKELEY, Jan. 31.-â Dr: David
Starr i Jordan has : , declared that revivals
are a species of insanity or moral drunk
enness rather than the result of a change
of heart.
-. This startling statement . was made by
the ..president of .Stanford' University in
the course of a lecture ..delivered at Berke
ley this morning, under . the auspices of
the Unitarian Society.
v His audience, which . filled Stiles Hail,
: was composed, largely of members of the
university faculty : and students.. but even
these exponents of advanced thought
: were rather startled at the emphatic views
expressed by the head of the Palo Alto in
stitution, and a decided furor was pre
dicted when th 1 * report, of his utterance
reaches the orthodox ministry.
Dr. Jordan spoke at some length on this
phase. of his lecture, which he denomi
i nated "The Sober Mind." '.' He declared
that it : was : an absolute - impossibility to
Undergo the transition from a wicked to
an upright-life in five minutes.
' Preceding this rather sensational state
\ ment Dr. ' Jordan treated his subject in
i the light of modern philosophy and drew
j his illustrations irom such men as Thor
eau, Tennyson and Fitzgerald.
He believed that the man of -sober mind
instead of attempting to adjust the world
â¢ to suit his individual opinion would en
j deavor to adjust bis own point of view,
I and thus show consideration for things
i past and things present. He described
| the various forms of pessimism and their
causes, believing that the most pessi
; mistic man of all is the one who sees
I things only as they are, without , looking
| to what might be their possibilities.
It is only as man improves himself and
I eets out of bis immediate environment, he
j said, that he can expect to be of "sober
mind."
Dr. Jordan said that he was not a
preacher, but that if he ever became one
' he would take hi; texts up where he found
â¢ tbem, thus indicating tue liberality of his
j doctrine.

when he went to the store to-day to. look
at his treasure he found it was gone.

door had been bored. â¢ There was a nickel

AN OPTIMISTIC RELIGION
Rev. Harold Bolce Talks on the
'â¢ Theology ot the Next 'â  â â¢ '.>
â¢ ' 7 ; , Century. â :â¢â¢;.â¢;.â . ;j ':
He Says the Doctrine of Hell and a
Devil Is "Only a Fable That â
Will Be Discarded. .' â¢'
Rev. Harold Bolce spoke at Golden Gate
Hall last night on "The Religion of the'
Twentieth Century," treating incident
ally on the religion of the past and the
striking characteristics of the nineteenth
century.
' "It is but a few years until we reach the
twentieth century," said the speaker,
"and one naturally speculates 'on what
will be the religion of that epoch of his
tory. It strikes me that whatever else
that religion will be it is to be a beautiful
optimism and it is to be free from some of
the cruel theology 'that has characterized
the past." :'.j.-'-J. 7: 7 7
Tne speaker showed that 'the great
characteristics of this century have been
religious liberty and the" triumph of
democracy. ."It is no longer the divine
right of kings," he said, "but the divine
right of .the "individual. Never before
have there been such. possibilities as exist
to-day in every realm of activity. â¢' Tors
has resulted :in a broadening of views. It
strikes me that the religion of the twen
tieth century will be far . more optimistic
than -that of to-day. Schopenhauer can
not triumph in the future. Nothing but â¢
optimism can reconcile the- tragedies of .
human, life and. modify our views of the
.violence that abounds in nature." .;-.
â¢â  The speaker, held that theology will
have little place in the. religion of to-
morrow." "The- torch of science purges
religion of the idea of a devil,'-' Â° he said,
"and drives out the idea of eternal hell."
Damnation as a doctrine is a nightmare,
like the fairy tales of goblins and spooks.
It is wrong to say that God will cast any
soul as rubbish into an eternal void, but
men will, of course, suffer the consequen
ces of their actions. .'lf no soul is io be
eternally lost there is, then, no. element of
failure in creation. The twentieth century
will not believe in a non-resident God, but
in God everywhere, for all lile = dwells in
the perpetual presence oftbe infinite yet
God does not discuss whether drops, or
gallons of water ' are proper in . baptism.
Jesus was not a theologian, and the church
is yet to outgrow theology."

â¢â¢: Sacramento at this time, but there appears
.." to be a very strong movement to assist the â¢.
- .".-bill introduced to secure tWo camp sites â
â¢â¢â¢ one. in the northern part of the State and .
: â¢ the other in the- southern part. While j
". "campsites are good in their way, there are j
- '_â¢ many in the guard who are of the opinion j
.."â¢'that they are nut of the necessities at this i
. -period. They say that there ,never has { i
been any difficulty in securing sites, and
. that it were best at this juncture to let
' â¢*â¢ the site go to some future session, and to
. do some practical work in the lino of
having camps, or appropriation for the
Same. The Dill for sites was introduced
â¢â¢ by Cross of Los Angeles, and the mem
; bers of the ' guard â¢ think it somewhat
.singular that it should name as Commis
sioners to secure such sites a man from
Lbs Angeles, Adjutant-General Barrett,
who is from the southern part of the
. State, and leaving one Commissioner to
be selected from anywhere, but he would
â¢be in the minority in that commission.
- These sites are to be secured either by do
nation or purchase, and if by purchase at
a cost not to exceed $40,000. * - *

with, bigamy. .- â¢â¢ . â¢â ' * .." â¢*.- *Â°- ' â¢* ... _. 'â  :
From the hrst it has. boen apparent to
detectives ahd all whoeonversed with bim
that he is a well-educated man, and no one
was able to draw from -him the' history of
the past. This .at noon he made public
a document, that contains some remarkable
and interesting statements.
â '. Gay declares that- he comes of a family
that is influential -.politically, and.'thai.he â¢
â was -a- few years ago a man of wealth and
commercial standing. He still refuses to
say where his parents are living, as he de
clares it- would break their hearts did they
know he was in distress.. '
About ten days ago Gay was living in
Alameda with is wife, whom he married
a short time ago. Without any warning a
woman from Colorado entered his house,
declared she was his wife and a little later
caused his arrest for bigamy. . '..-'"
Among his other troubles Gay tells
of bis surprise when tendered a bill for
the headstone of his wife's previous hus
band.-. Another amusing chapter is his
description' of the surprise he was treated
to when he answered a "young lady's"
matrimonial, advertisement and found he
had accepted the proposal of a woman old
enough to be his mother. ". â¢"
Gay's strange tale, he says, would never
have been told had it not been for the
story of the â¢ lady from Colorado, which
was published some days ago. * .'â¢-.'
Here is Gay's little romance:
"Every man must look out for himself,
and I should not have said a word In
self-defense. had I not deemed it necessary
to speak and defend myself from the
statements of this woman from Colorado.
"It was in February or March of 1896,
--while I was .engaged in " business at Ben
son Mines. N...Y., that a copy of.the
Chicago, World fell into * my 'hands. It
publishes. a free correspondence column,
and while looking over (his . column -one
day I saw the following peisbnal*
â¢ Wantedâ Correspondence- by a Christian
.woman of '.Kind and loving disposition; he
must have means' and live West of the Missis
sippi River; object matrimony.
*7. .*'-- Mrs. Nellie Vans, Washington", Ind. .
-"â 'ln a spirit of fun I answered this ad,"
and received a letter from the advertiser;,
in which she stated that" her name was
Mrs. Millie'Ed.ean, and that. her home was
in Pueblo, Colo., and .in her next letter
she begged me to hasten to her at Wash
ington, Ind.; Hint she had' been suddenly
called to Pueblo, and that she would iike
to have the /question settled before she
went home, l did .not go, however, and
our correspondence was kept up.' She
wrote very sweet and tender letters to me,
and praised herself up so very much tbat
I began to thin]*; she was a good Christian
woman. She sent me references, but 1
placed so much confidence in her that I
would not write to them. â¢ â¢â '.* *.
â¢-.-â¢'We' exchanged' photographs,* and her
picture was very good and pleasing. It
was . the 7 picture of _.a ' young-looking
woman, -Finally, however, her letters be
gan to assume a vulgarity of * which I did
not dream her capable, and, although we
were engaged to be married, I did not ap
prove the language. We were to have
been married in the fore part of Septem
ber, but when" I received those letters I
became suspicious that all was not right,
and r I. did not write so" often, although re
ceiving 'one letter every day from her.
Finally I wrote to her asking a postpone
ment of the marriage. ; She refused to
consent to it for even a day, saying that I
must fulfill my promi-se or it would be the
"worse for me. ' â¢ . â Â°
â¢ â¢"Then L came more of those tender and
loving letters until about the 20th of June,
when one day word came to me tbat my
last venture had. failed, and the last cent
I possessed in the world was. gone. In a
\ moment of frenzy I at once telegraphed
| to Pueblo that -I should leave for there
the- next moaning. 1 must have been
crazy, for all I can remember was that 1
was escaping from a place where I bad
worked hard to live a true, honest and
Christian life, but. where I had lost all I

The Book of Job
The seventh of a series of Sunday evening
sermons on the Bible was delivered last' c veil
ing by the Rev.- William Rader in the Third
Congregational Church. It was on The Bo6k
of Job," which, the reverend gentleman, de
clared, belongs to the wisdom literature of the
Old Testament. Reviewing the book; at
length, the speaker said: "Job teaches the
possibility of disinterested goodness;- of c ing
ing to truth for its own sake, j The Book of
Job teaches us to distinguish between punish
ment and discipline; between anger anti love,
and that wnile we do not understand the way**
of the Almighty we should tryst and. not be
afraid.". â  , Â'.*â¢â¢' v J
