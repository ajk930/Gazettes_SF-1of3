APPEAL FOB THE
PERISHING POOR
Chicago's Mayor Calls Upon
Well-to- Do Citizens
for Aid.
Forty Thousand Families Sorely
iD Need of Fue ! , Food
and Cothing.
Heroic Efforts of the Police Depart
ment Temporarily Allay the
Awful Suffering.
CHICAGO, iM-t Jan. 25.â The people
,pf Chicago in bodies and as individual
â¢:zens were aroused to-day to take
i orapt and generous action for the
prompt relief of the two score thousand
destitute families who are in want of food
and clothing, their distress having
reached a critical stage during this in
tensely cold weather.
Between 5 and 7 o'clock this morning
the weather bureau in the Auditorium
tower, where it is warmer than on the
street, recorded 20 degrees below zero.
Only once in the history of the bureau,
December 24, 1872, when it was 23 below,
has the temperature fallen lower. From
9 a. M. to 2 p. h. there was a gradual rise,
the range being from 18 to 12 degrees be
low, but the relief was hardly felt when
accompanied by a cutting wind from the
northwest. The highest temperature for
the day was 10 degrees below zero, and to
night the bureau' thermometer is moving
slowly down again with no hope of relief
held out for to-morrow.
Mayor Swift issued a proclamation to
day, according to his expressed intention
yesterday, appealing in urgent language
to all citizens who have the means to
spare to contribute at once money and
supplies to prevent the starvation and
freezing of unfortunate thousands. He
. urged the subscription of $100,000 as beine
none too much to afford the relief needed.
Mayor Swift's proclamation is as fol
lows:
To the Gcntrous People of Chicago: The pres
ent severe weather must naturally excite the
keen sympathy of every kindly disposed per
son for the worthy and suffering poor. A pro
tracted period of business depression has
thrown thousand!" of men and women out of
employment and brought want to families not
previously familiar with it. No startling
emergency exists, but the need constantly dis
cerned in cities is now augmented by the
hard times and the extreme cold. You hava
ever been found generous in behalf of all
worthy objects, and I think if proper at this
::ui ;n this way to call your attention to
special occasion now existing for a mani
festation of your reasonable generosity.
The distress of women and children in their
homesoughtespeciallv to be relieved. Thoreare
many worthy persons who hesitate to seek as
sistance but suffer in silence. I propose to
utilize the police department, havr; them In
vestigate cases of destitution, particulftrly in
homes, and give prompt help to thoÃe found
wortny.
I ask contributions of money, food and
clothing. Money maybe sent to E. .I. Keith,
president of the Metropolitan National Bank,
and all money contributions should be desig
nated as intended for the "Mayor's Relief
Fund."
This will be expended under the direction of
the General Superintendent of Police for the
purchase of fuel and food. Contributions of
food and clothing may be sent imme.iiately to
the General Superintendent of I'o.ice 8t the
City Hall. George B. swift, Mayor.
The funds of the charity organizations
have' become depleted, owing tothp extra
ordinary demands made upon them even
during the mild winter weather which
lhas prevailed here until a lew days ago,
and the Chicago Relief and Aid Society
was compelled to make a special appeal
for money last week to carry on its work
because ol the unusually larce number of
heads and supporters of families who are
unemployed while willing to work.
â  Before the Mayor's proclamation was
issued contributions to the special fund
came pouring into his office in currency
and checks, while various offers of pro
visions, clothinu, coal and wood were re
ceived on a liberal scale. The Board of
Trade and other organizations started to
raise relief funds and the churches and
palvation armies began making sys
tematic and extensive arrangements to
help in the charitable work along their
special lines. Souphouses and shelters
will be established and maintained as long
as necessary.
[ A plan which the Mayor and Chief of
Police Badenoch agreed upon at a confer-
V eoce to-day was immediately put into
effect. The city will buy with the special
fund food and fuel and distribute them on
demand through the agency of the police
department. This relief is to be afforded
without the usual investigation until the
regular charitable organizat ons are able
to take up the work. All police stations
have been thrown open to the freezing
multitude.
The Mayor's proclamation is the first
of the kind to be issued in twenty-five
years.
The worst and most numerous cases of
Buffering were reported from South Chi
cago and Kensington, where thousands of
men have been lnid off at the steel mills
and other establishments.
. The savings of most of these victims
have been used these hard times to pay
for their little homes, leaving them prac
tically penniless, although not paupers.
Much da mace has been done in the sub
urbs to telegraph and telephone wires by
the cold. Traffic with Cicero was sus
pended until lale 10-day by the collapse
of cable poles.
The worfc of affording instant tempor
ary relief during the inclement weather
was pushed by the police agents using
patrol wagons and ambulances in such a
systematic manner that no case of desti
tution reported remained unattended to
I to-night.
At midnight the thermometer registered
111 degrees below, and it is believed the up
ward tendency will continu-. Police sta
tions about the city are filled with lodeers,
many of whom applied for shelter with
frozen ears and fingers.

PENVER, Colo., Jan. 25.â The coidest
weather of the winter has prevailed in this
The San Francisco Call
city and throughout the State during the
past forty-eight hours, and still continues.
At 8 o'clock this morning the thermome
ter registered 8 deg. below zero. Several
cases of probable suffering were reported
to the County Commissioners and relief
was promptly furnished. Trains are pull-
In* in and out on schedule time and no
serious delay is reported either on moun
tain or prairie roads.

I Thousands of Families in St. Louis Are
in Dire Distress. .
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 26.â The cold
wave which gathered in British Columbia
on Friday swept down on this section
yesterday and still continues here though
slightly abated to-night. At 7 o'clock this
morning the temperature was exactly
zero. At. noon 3 degrees above was re
corded and at 5 p. m. 4 degrees above. This
extremely low temperature following
sharply upon a long season of mild
weather found thousands of ( poor families
unprepared.
The demand upon the associated chari
ties for food and fuel was never so great.
Nearly 300 men and women were in line
to-day waiting for assistance. The Police
Department is doing everything possible
to relieve the distress. Twenty-two frost
bitten victims were treated at the City
Dispensary to-day, and three amputations
were necessary. Hundreds of homeless
people are sheltered to-day at the police
stations.
The river has not yet closed here, though
it is full of floating ice, which endangers
shipping. Trains were generally on time
this morning, but this evening all those
due from points west ana south were late,
in one instance two hours and ten min
utes. All were delayed by snow block
ades. Special dispatches show that no
section west or south of this city has es
caped the sudden fury of the blizzard.
For the first time ice formed for a short
time over Lower White River, in Arkan
sas, to-day. Snow is reported in West
Tennessee and Southern Illinois. The
great fruit section of Southwestern Mis
souri, and Northern Arkansas has es
pecially suffered, and nothing can save
the crop. A fall of snow that would have
saved trie wheat fields of Missouri. lowa
and Nebraska did not come with the cold
wave, and predictions of disaster to the
crop were frequent on 'Change.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 25. â The
coldest weather this winter has prevailed
during the last twenty-lour hours in this
section of the Southwrst. There is no
snow, but a high, freezing wind has added
to the suffering. Great loss cf livestock is
reported. Tne cold wave extended to the
territories. An average of 4 degrees be
low zero is reported in Kansas, with no
prospect of immediate relief.

ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 25.â Excessive
.cold is reported again to-day alt over the
Northwest. It is 20 below in St. Paul and
as low as 32 below at points northwest of
here. Signal service reports, however, in
dicate that 1 there will be a slight modera
tion to-morrow. . ... , .. : ........
Railroad trains . are all running here,
but are from one to four hours late, ow
ing to the inability of the trainmen to
keep up steam in such intense cold. The
South Dakota rotary snowpiows are work- '
me to raise the blockade caused on all
railroads by Saturday's and Sunday's
storm.
The Chicago and Northwestern Railroad
will soon have its East and South lines
open from Huron. A snowplow has been
sent to the train snowbound at Higbmore,
S. Dak., since Saturday last with about
forty passengers.
The Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad
in Dakota is completely tied up, and it
will be several days before an attempt
will be made to open the Great Northern
line between Watertown and Huron.
Nothing concerning stock on the ranges
can be learned for several days, but it is
feared the intense cold and deep snow will
entail severe losses.
Apprehension is also felt for settlers in
remote districts where fuel is scarce. The
storm covers a vast area of South Dakota
and in many respects is more severe than
the storm of 188*, when 107 persons per
ished.
DULUTri, Minn.. Jan. 25.â The Gov
ernment thermometers here to-day regis

DEB MOINES, lowa, Jan. 25.â With the
mercury lor the past three days having
scarcely mounted up to zero and most of
the time 10 to 25 degrees below the at
tendance will be disappointingly small
when the annual convention of the Na
tional Woman Suffrage Association opens
to-morrow. There is hardly a delegate
from south of Kentucky, and the East
will be poorly represented compared with
expectations. The Far and Central West
will be fairly represented. As a result the
executive committee to-night discussed
having the conventions hereafter in the
summer or fall and a change will probably
be made. The more noted leaders are
nearly all here. To-morrow afternoon
Susan B. Anthony, the president, will de
liver her annual address and the reports
will begin. They are expected to show
the work to have made encouraging
progress.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 25.â The ter

among the poor of Cleveland eclipses any
previous record. " ;. *
This morning the mercury had dropped
to eleven below, which brought a number
ot half-starved, frozen 7 families to the
relief departments of the city. They ap
plied for food and coal. Red tape in < the
matter of the investigation was dispensed
with, arid for the first time in the history
of the city the applicants- for relief were
given the benefit of a doubt.

INCIDENTS OF THE FOLSOM EXCURSION.
WEYLER'S PATH IS
MARKED BY FIRE
Illuminates the Way So the
Insurgents Have Time
to Avoid Him.
Assistant Butcher Fondeviella Is
Causing a Terrible Reign
of Bloodshed.
Continues to Arrest and Slaughter
the Unfortunate Citizens of the
Town cf Guanabaco 1 .
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 26.â Advices
from Havana say that the conflict be
tween the sugar planters and Weyler con
tinues with more bitterness than ever.
Both are deiermined to carry out their
purposes and the unusual spectacle is pre
sented of two contending parties tiehting
with one another without openly declar
ing their hostilities.
Of the war little that is new can be said
Weyler continues on his march without
deviating from the highways and railroad
line?. Despite the strong column march
ing w'th him, he fears to enter the unex
pioied regions. As he burns and destroys
everything in his passage, he illuminates
his way as if be curried a torch in his
hand, and the rebels can easily avoid any
encounters with his solid column. Thus
it is explained why he has no encounters
with them. '
As an idea of the notorious Fondeviella's
character, it is said that when it was re
ported to him that all the Spanish officers
captured by Aranguerin had been re
leased he remarked: "Aranguerin did well
in setting th*;m free, or there would not
remain a single Cuban alive to-day in
Guanabacoa."
The arrest and Killing of the nnforiunate
citizens of that town continues, and as he
has prohibited their removai to this city
or other places, the situation can ba un
derstood. Persons who have visited the
town say there could not be a more shock
ing sight. All the houses are closed, ladies
fear to look out of the windows, as the sol
diers will surely insult them; few citizens
walk around the streets, only armed sol
diers, soiled and repulsive, are to be scan.
Reports of the landing of expeditions
have baen afloat in Havana for the last
few days. One is said to have landed in
Pinar del Rio and the other around Mau
zanitlo. The exact location has not yet
been ascertained.
The forces under Weyler's command
number 14,000 infantry, a cavalry regi
ment and twenty-two pieces of artillery.

Information Given Out by the Legation
at Washington.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 25. --"The
most complete news that we have yet re
ceived from Cuba." said Mr. Dubosc, the
first secretary of the Spanish legation ,
to-day, "reached us to-day by cable from
Madrid. It is a telegram from the Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, Duke Tetuan, em
bodying the points of a dispatch sent to
him by the Captain-General at Havana.
The Duke's dispatch reads as follows:
" 'General Weyler at the head of four
teen battalions has traversed the provinces
of Havana and Matanzas, compelling the
principal rebel chieis to fly to Las Villas,
abandoning their horses in the river Ha
bana, many of the fugitives perishing in
Maritimas. Weyler considers that in Ha
vana and Matanzas there are no longer
great organized bands to disperse, and that
both provinces may be regarded almost
entirely pacified. The sugar properties in
the rear of the troops have already begun
to grind.'
"This information the Minister, Mr. Du
puy de Lome, authorizes me to give to the
United Associated Presses," said Mr. Du
bosc. '"Aside from the fact that it comes
from the Minister of Foreign Affairs it
has been confirmed by several other
sources and may be relied on as entirely
correct. The legation is very particular
not to give out news tÂ»at cannot be sub
stantiated. This is the second dispatch
that the legation has mod's public in two
months. The other waa at the time of
Maceo's death, which was at first denied
here and in New York and afterward,
when it was no longer denied, it was im
puted to treachery.
"I should explain," Mr. Dubosc went
on, "that General Weyler started on his
present trip about ei<sht days ago. The
province of Pinar del Rio has been under
practical subjection ever since Maceo's
death. The province of Santa Clara can
hardly be said to have ever been in revolt,
and as a revolt we now have four pro
vinces in which there is little, if any, dis
turbance. When the new reforms for
Cuba are promulgated, as they will prob
ably be in the next fortnight, they will
be put into effect in all the six provinces
of Cuba. You ask me if the Cubans are
ready for these new measures. I have no
hesitancy in replying in the affirmative.
The only people who oppose the reforms
and desire the continuance ol revolution
are the patriots in New York. The rebels
in Cuba are anxious for peace. In my
opinion the days of the insurrection are
numbered."
MOST BARHARO US WARFARE.
Foreigners Protest in fain Against
Spanish Atrocities.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 23.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: In
the province of Havana the war has as
sumed the most barbarous character since
Wcyler gave his last orders to Jay waste
the entire country.
Around the town of Guines the Span
iards have destroyed everything. Noth
ing can stay their inhuman work, and the
property of either friend or foe is reduced
to ashes. Many foreigners have vainly
protested. The protest of a foreigner is
brought to Weyler, or, in his absence, to
his secretary, the Marquis de Pelmerala.
The reply is generally: "Let the foreign
ers present their claims through diplo
matic channels."
Senorita Sigarron, a distinguished
young woman, has received orders to leave
the island within a week under pain of
imprisonment. Another Cuban lady,
Etnelia Cordova, has received a similar
order of banishment. Clemencia Arango,
sister of the Cuban Colonel Raoul Arango,
was the victim of still more cruel treat
ment. The police searching her rooms for
letters from her brotner treated her so
rougiily as to arouse the indignation of all
the neighbors.
An editorof the Diarfo de la Marina was
summoned to the palace of Admiral Na
varro as soon as the news was circulated
of the destruction of the Spanish gunboat
Cometa by the insurgents near Cayamos,
Matanzas. The editor received orders to
deny the news, and accordingly the fol
lowing lines appeared in yesterday's edi
tion of the paper: "The splendid gunboat
Cometa is dbiug her duty on the coast of
Cuba. She has not been destroyed by the
insurgents. The press of New York has
again been deceived by the lies of the
Cuban sympathizers, who, by way of Key
West, send to the United States all kinds
of false reports." >
La Lucba publishes the same denial as
official, which relieves it of any responsi
bility in case the authorities are in the
wrong. However, the Cubans here have
ratified the news. It came to Havana
through a trustworthy Cuban agent.
That the town of Cayamos, where the
cunboat is said to have be n blown up,
surrendered to the insurgents and was
destroyed is beyond any question.
Admiral Navarro was so angry over the
news that be said; "I will order the
Cometa to enter Havana harbor with all
her flags flying and salute Morro Castle
with twenty shots." Time will show
whether Admiral Navarro is playing a
game of blnff.
In Brujo, Pinar del Rio province, a hot
engagement lasting four hours was fought
on Friday, in which the CuDans num
bered 2000 men. In Sagua another en-
I gairement of importance has occurred, in
which the Spanish Captain Carerras suf
fered losses, and the Cubans lost thiee
well-known leadersâ Estanilas, Jose Rogue
and Pedro Nod arse.
Near Victoria de las Tunas another en
counter is reported between Calixto Garcia
and the Spaniards, in which a Cuban vic
tory is beyond any doubt. The Spaniards
confess to seven killed, which is an ex
traordiuary admission in an official report.
Around Havana and even in the poor
districts of the city famine is spreading
and if the destruction of all the country
continues, as Weyler intends, the misery
of the once rich capital of Cuba will at
tract the attention of the world. The
epidemic of smallnox is augmenting. The
cases number 3200 to-day.
ARIIESTISI* lH CUBA.
President Cleveland Submit* .Some In
formation to the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 25.â The
Presiuent to-day sent to the Senate, in
response to a resolution, a list of American
citizens, either native born or naturalized,
who have been arreste.i in Cuba since the
beginning of the present insurrection,
together with the action taken in each
case. The arrests number seventy- four.
Of these seven have been tried, and ap
peals were taken in two instances from
the sentence imposed â those of Sanguilly
and Someilian. In the case of the five
Competitor prisoners a new trial has been
ordered. Seven American newspaper cor
respondents were also arrested and ban
ished. ________^__
SMALL FIREARMS IN DEMAND.
Chicago Dealers Have Not Done Such a
Thriving Business Since the B/g^
Railroad Sirike.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 'Js.â On the prin
ciple that it is an ill wind that blows no
one any good, dealers in small firearms
are congratulating themselves that the
carnival of store and street holdups has
given their business a more decided boom
than it has experienced since the great
railroad strike and the so-called Chicago
riots. Despite the heavy penalties pro
vided by law for the carrying of concealed
weapons it is said that from 50 to 60 per
cent of the male population who are out
after nightfall provide themselves with
means of protection. In most of the
saloons, especially in the outlying dis
tricts, a revolver can be found reposing on
a shelf under the bar or in the hip pocket
of the bartender, and the same applies to
drugstores and other places of business
such as restaurants that keep open until a
late hour or all night. In the business
offico of one of the largest gas companies
in the city a big navy revolver rests in full
view on the counter immediately beside
the cash drawer, although the receiving
clerk is protected from outside attacks by
ar. abundance of wire netting.
It is the consensus of opinion among
dealers that there are more revolvers be
ing carried or otherwise used for purposes
of protection in this city than ever before.
Loaded canes, on the other hand, are a
drug in the market. All the ticket-sellers
of the Metropolitan elevated road have
also been equipped with revolvers.

TO PROBE THE
GREAT SCANDAL
Speaker Cocmbs Announces
the Committee on the
Temporary Roll.
It Is Believed That an Effort
Will Be Made to Suppress
the Evidence.
Members of the Assembly Would
Rather Duckworth Take the
Blame Than Themselves.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 25.â Speaker
Coombs this morninc announced bis com
mittee to investigate the scandal of the
temporary roll. They are: Waymire,
Ken yon, Strain, Keables, Boone, Emmons
and Stanseli. The resolution authorizing
their appointment called for a fall, free
and fair investigation of all matters con
nected with the temporary organization
of the Assembly, and Judge Waymire
seems determined to carry on the inves
tigation in that way.
The committee met in the library at 5
o'clock this afternoon in a pokey corner
where the newspaper tiles are stored and
after calling the meeting to order Chair
man Waymire made a little speech call
ing the attention of the members to the
importance of the duty required of them
by the Assembly. "It Â»s our duty as
legislators," be said, "to allow no more
men to be employed than are necessary.
If we have permitted any more men to be
employed than are necessary we are to
blame. If Duckworth, as the clerk
charged by us to attend to this matter
that no more should be employed than
are necessary, has violated that duty we
should know it."
Waymire went on to say that he had
heard that Duckworth had remarked that
he would employ more men the next
time. It would be well to inquire wheiher
the clerk had made that remark. It was
In order for the committee to devise a plan
of procedure.
Enimons suggested that it would be
well to inquire how certain powers of at
torney got to Sacramento so soon after
the warrants for mileage, etc., had been
drawn. He moved that the committee
should first ascertain how many men
were employed in the temporary organi
zation, what it had cost, by what author
ity had they been employed, and whether
in appointing toem any wrong was com
mitted and who was to blame.
Chynoweth said that he had accepted
his appointment on the committee with
the understanding that he would be al
lowed to make a thorough investigation,
so as to place the blame wh ere it be
longed. Chynoweth was thereupon se
lected to examine witnesses on behalf of
the State.
Judson C. Brusie appeared as counsel
for Duckworth. Belshaw placed the com
mittee in possession of a letier which he
said be had recently received. It was
written on a letterhead of the Monterey
Meat Company and was signed "Thos.
Doud." The writer said that C. A. Rod
riguez, A. Gunzensdorfer and W. H.
Kearney, who had been placed on the
temporary roll at $5 per day, were in Mon
terey during the temporary organization
ot the Assembly and were not in Sacra
mento at all. They were intimate friends
of Duckworth. The letter concluded, "If
you will investigate you will find that N.
Friedman, the man who cashed so many
of the warrants, is Duckworth's brother's
political partner in San Francisco."
Brusie at this point entered a protest
against the mode of procedure pursued bp
the committee. He said that it would be
very unjust to Duckworth if the commit
tee accepted evidence in his absence and
which might be used against him subse
quently.
Emmons said that he was there as a
member of the Assembly to rmrga the As
sembly of the charge of stuffing the roll.
"It seems," he added, "that we are mak
ing a good deal of Duckworth and very
little of the investigation. Wherever the
blame is there let it be placed and let
everybody know it. I believe in going to
the root and bottom of this thing."
The remaining members of the commit
tee seemed to be of the same mind. It is
reported that an effort will be made by
Assemblymen on the committee to star
chamber the investigation, because tut
movers do not wish to have ail the facts
published regarding the appointments
made at their request, and several other
matters.
But the composition and temper of the
committee are such that the effort to sup
press the facts will fail. The people of
the State demand all the facts in the case
and they are entitled to have them through
the only unprejudiced mediumâ the press.
The committee will meet to-morrow after
the third reading of the file ha* been fin
ished, and will proceed to examine the
temporary roll and take evidence thereon.
Duckworth's brother i* satisfied with the
personnel of the committee. He exhibits
the following dispatch from the chairmen
of the Republican and Democratic com
mittees of Monterey County:
Salinas, Cal., Jan. 23, 1897.
To Hon. 8. J. Dmdtwortk: Yonr friends in

in not resigning, and believe you are right.

Somewhat of a sensation was sprung by
Cbynoweth. He stated that a certain bill
which had been introduce'! had been de
tained and not sent to the printer. He
understood the clerk had withheld it at
the request of some person aivi wanted to
know if thai was usuai. Speaker Coombs
stated that no one had a risrht to request
such action and the clerk bad no right to

TWO IXTEKEbIIAG EPISODES.
Peculiar Distribution of Printed Bill* to
He Investigated.
SACRAMENTO, Gal., Jan. 25.â There
were two interesting episodes in the Senate
chamber to-day. One was in reference to
the appropriation bill for the State Printer,
and the other bore on what Senator With
ington designated as "the robbery of the
sergearit-at arms' office."
It was the hour for the consideration of
Assembly bills, and under this head the
Assembly bill, amended co as to carry
175,000, as originally asked for by State
Printer Johnson, was called up. It had
been reduced by the Assembly to $30,000.
The Senate Finance Committee had re-
Etored the $75,000. Chairman Voorheis ad
dressed the Senate in behalf of the measure,
explaining that tbe State Printer had ap
pearei before the Finance Committee and
had made a showing that convinced them
of tbe necessity for the $75,000 appropria
tion.
Senator Withington was of the opinion
that the appropriation oupht to be cut
down to the figures fixed by the Assembly.
He charged that the expense of the State
.Printing Office had been greatly increased
by the cost of printing reports, argu
ments, etc., for the Railroad Commission
in connection with "the fake suit brought
by the Southern Pacific Company against
the Railroad Commission." He addsd
that all that bad been accomplished by
the expenditure of a large sum of money
in this suit bad been the overruling of a
demurrer. Withington was quite carried
away with his spasm of economy.
Yoorheis explained that this amount
was absolutely necessary if the business
of the Legislature were not to be blocked,
as there was absolutely no funds at pres
ent in the hands of the State Printer,
The amount asked for, he said, would
carry the State Printine Office to the end
of June, the close of the fiscal year, ana be
concluded by remarking that he did not
think it necessary for the Senate to make
a gallery play for reducing the amount, as
had beec done ia the Assembly.
The amendment to the Assembly bill
tiling the appropriation at $75,000 was
carried by a vote of 31 to 4.
Brannhart moved as an amendment to
the bill that the money appropriated
therein should be applied to priming for
the Legislature only. He explained that
be did not think it right for the Legisla
ture at this time to provide for a deficiency
in the State Printing Office. There was
some argument, and on being pot to a
vote the amendment was defeated by 6
ayes to 26 noes.
It is a notorious fact that for torn c days
it has been impossible for any one, Sena
tors included, to get copies of certain bills,
notwithstanding that a special resolution
was passed early in the session providing
that Senators, newspaper correspondents
and others properly entitled to them
should be provided with copies of all
Senate documents. Trie annoyance cre
ated by this state of affairs became
so aggravated to-day that Senator With
ington was impelled to introduce the fol
lowing:
Resolved, That the sergeant-at-arms be and
be is hereby instructed and directed to pro-
Tide no persons other than Senator*, the Sen
ftte commiueea and the statutory officers of
SENATOR HOLLOWAY, Chairman of the Committee on Attaches and Contingent Expenses.
the Senate with any Assembly or Senate bills,
and that he is specially instructed not to lur
nish to persons not so connected with the
Senate any bills or other documents in his
charge for distribution.
This was viewed as being aimed directly
against the news-paper men, but no oppor
tunity was given them to be heard in the
matter until it had been passed, thought
less as it would appear, without a dissent
ing vote.
When Senator Withington was asked if
his resolution was intended to apply to
newspaper correspondents he replied, in m
tone of indignant virtue: "Certainly.
We propose to stop these robberies of the
sergeant-at-arms' office."
Subsequently Senator Bulla moved to
reconsider Withington's resolution, and
in the course of the debate which followed
Withington charged tne Los Angeles Sen
ator with obstructing legislation by tak
ing up the time of the Senate in behalf of
the newspaper men, and implying that he
had interested motives in so doing.
Bulla'd motion to reconsider was carried,
and the objectionable resolution was
amended so as to exclude the newspaper
correspondents from its operation.
After the adjournment of the Senate
Bulla took Withington to task for his re
flection on Bulla's action, and quite a
heated altercation took place. The sym
pathy of the Senate, as its action proved,
was decidedly with Bulla and the cause he
espoused.
Incidentally it may be staled that 500
copies of each Senate bill are ordered
printed, and that out of this number 100
are sent to the Assembly, 200 are used to
supply, presumably, although not in real
ity, various State offices and newspaper
correspondents, and sixty are for distri
bution among the Senators and statutory
officers of tbe Senate. Not since the ses
sion began has any correspondent bad a
copy of a bill placed on his desk, and what
becomes of the additional 140 copies of
bills is a mystery.
Senator Bulla stated to-day that he had
heard that one of the attaches in the office
of the sergeant- at- arms bad been each
day mailing forty-five complete files of all
bills to some individual, for which service
he was receiving v compensation of $5 a
day. Scrgeant-at-Arms Blackburn denies
that this is to. There may be an investi
gation of the sergeant-at-arms' office.

Braunhart Teru Anxious to Jteauee the
Streetcar Fare*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 25.â When
the San Francisco delegation held its first
official meeting as a Senate committee to
day it took up Senate bill 30, providing
for reducing streetcar fares in San Fran
cisco during certain hours of the morning
and evening to 1% cents. Senator Dick
inson opposed the 'motion to report it
favorably, and said that before any action
was taken the street railways to be
affected should be given a hearing.
Braunhart called attention to the fact
that the bill was in the hands of thÂ° Com
mittee on Corporations, of which Dickin
son is a member, for some time before it
was reported favorably to the San Fran
cisco delegation. It was finally decided
to report the measure favorably to-mor
row.
The author of the bill claims there is no
reason why the measure should not pass.
He alleges it is neither unconstitutional
nor unjust, as claimed by its opponents. In
support of his measure he cites an article
in a publication known as "City Govern
ment." Using the facts and figures con
tained in this article the author of the 2%
--cent measure said:
"It is a well-known fact, and one ac
knowledged by the street railway people,
that San Francisco residents do more
riding in proportion to population than
any city in the world. The annual gross
receipts of the Market-street system alone
are $3,000,000, sad though it is capitalized
for about $17,500,000, it pays fair dividends
every year.
"I have no doubt that it can be proved
that the actual value of the plant is but a
small portion of this amount. All that I
claim, under the circumstances, is that if
the Toronto street railway, with a less
percentage of riding population than San
Francisco railways enjoy, can afford to
carry passengers for from 2% to 4 cents
eacb, tnose of Ban Francisco should cer
tainly be able to do the same, and even
considerably better."

Snail the Product of the Folsom. Crusher
Compel* it/i Mr tie Labor?
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 25.âCompe
tition iii crushed rock between prison aud
free labor formed the principal topic of
discussion before the Senate Committee
on State Prisons to-day. :
The question was whether the product
of .the Folsom rock-crasher should be put
on the market in full competition with
that of private crushers, or should be
used only for highways outside of cities. .
It was decided to refer to the Attorney-
General whether it would be lawful to fix
two prices for : the Folsom product â one
price for rock to be used in the streets of
cities and a lower price for ; that to be
used on country roads. Another way out
of the difficulty that was suggested was to
fix a compromise price of 40 cents a ton
at the crusher." The present price is 25
cents. -While this is said to be satisfactory
to the competitors of the prison establish
ment, it is feared there may be opposition
.to it from those interested in the improve
ment of country highways. It was de
cided to recommend for passage the bill
appropriating $18,000 for 300 acres of im
proved land contiguous to the Folsom
prison grounds, to be used for agricultural
purposes.

Afternoon and Night Sessions
That Last Very Late
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 25. â The
Assembly is fairly getting used to the bar
ness of legislation, and a ttioug 1 half-day
sessions have been the rale during the
past three weeks, for the purpose of giving
the committees an opportunity of meeting
and work ng upon the bills, which to-day
reached the total of 519, fair progress has
been made.
Committee work is much more import
ant thud the mere onlooker would think.
The weiding of similar bills into one
uniting the good features and eliminating
the bad leatures of ail saves whole days of
time to the Assembly. For instance, two
members of the House have on more than
one occasion introduced bill?, some of
which were duplicates of others, word for
word. Then Senate bills have come in
duplicate of Assembly bills. The doubles
are thrown out, and ball a dozen illls on
the same subject and to the sume purport
are fused into one. Add to those combi
nations the bills reported upon adversely
and the pile of abou* a thousand bills in
both house-* will be materially reduced.
While the As>embly may have appeared
to be taking things easily, the same peo
ple when divided imo committees have
worked like wolves in full chase after a
fat porker. They have afternoon sessions
and night sessions, and the reporters have
their bands more than lull in chasing
around after the fifty committees imo
which the membership of both houses is
divided. Tne present session has devel
oped the fact that the Capitol building is
much too small to accommodate the com
mittees. Several have been obliged to
hold meetings in uncomfortable corners
ot the library. Others met in the base
ment, others in the attic and others in the
Assembly and Senate chambers. Their
afternoon sessions are long, sometimes
continuing untif after the dinner hour,
and the evening sessions are often pro
tracted until after midnight.
The Republican majority under the able
leadership of that shrewd tactician, Judge
Dibble of San Francisco, and the Demo
cratic minorityâ part of it fused with the
lost cause of Populism â under the leader
ship of the quiet but wily Caminetti, seem
to be determined to do the right thing for
the people, although the Demo-Pops spend
much valuable time and wind in trying to
mate political capital out of the mistakes
of the majority.
The Assembly, this session, has not yet
given any striking illustration of brilliant
oratory or statesmanship. With the ex
ception of the 6an Francisco delegation,
it seems to be made up of new material of
a different mold; not so showy as their
predecessors, but bent on business. Not
much time has been wasted in speeches,
and in fact there are not more than half a
dozen men in the House who can make a
speech that even the unthinking gallery
will applaud. Of these half a dozen Dib
ble stands at the head, and those who
have heard Judge Dibble speak in public
may be able to form a good estimate of
the rest.
Belshaw has some fire, but is impetuous
and is liable to say the thing in haste trial
is afterward repented of at leisure. North
is also fluent with the fluency of a turbid
flood in the snow- melting season, but the
big white polkadots in his necktia attract
the attention of the spectators 100 much
from the subject matter of his remarks,
dazing or hypnotizing them with white
spots on their minds. Treacy of Jan Fran
cisco speaks from the shoulder, and Leon
Dennery uses the stuffed club of oratory
in a surprisingly agile and gymnastic way.
Kelly, Henry, Pohiman aud Jones do not
aspire to the laurels that crown the brow
of the orator. They introduce bills and
work for them in a quiet and effective way.
Cutter is a ferocious speaker, and is at his
best in a cyclone.
It would be much easier to point out the
speakers who are missed than those who
are here. Spencer of Lassen, who made
so gallant a fight at t c last session for
woman suffrage, Jud B-rusie of Sacra
mento and a few more whose voices are
not heard in legislative balls are among
those whose loss is the most conspicuous
and whose piaces as entertaining speakers
remain unfilled.
But it requires a great occasion to bring
forth great speakers. The occasion has
not yet arisen in the life of this session,
and when it does who knows but that a
Kelly, a Damon, a Chynowetb, a Robin
son, a Guy, a Breiling, a Burnham or a
Price may not arise in his seat and stir
the gallery with the unwonted thrill of
eloquence that comes from the heart,
coaling the tongue with honey and gold
as in olden days when heroes moved 1 the*
souls of men co deeds of daring and re
nown.
The San Francisco delegation this even
ing agreed to report favorably upon
Treacy's Assembly bill 427, which pro
vides for t tie establishment of a municipal
hospital for dipsomaniacs and morphine,
opium and alcohol inebriates, in munici
palities of the first ciass, namely, San
Francisco. The bill has already been pub
lished in The Call.
The Assembly Committee on Prisons

J.OS AAGELEs' DILEMMA.
jftot let Heady to Support a Firttt-Clata
tjitv Government.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 25.â Senator
Bulla wants tbe minimum limit of popu
lation for cities of the first class raided
from 100,000 to 250,000. He explained on
the floor of tbe Senate to-day that Los
Angeles was now so near tbe 100.000 limit
that she would soon be within tbe first
class and tbat many hardships might thus
be imposed on her.
If Senator Denison's bill relative to tbe
examination of applicants for admission
to the practice of law, which he intro
duced to-day, becomes a law, the number
of embryo lawyers turned out each year
may be considerably reduced. It provides
that enminatlons-snall be held at least
twice eucb year, either before the court in
bank, before either department or at
chambers, as tbÂ« coiirt may prescribe.
No examination shall be for a shorter time
than two hours, nor shall the questions
to,be answered bs less than fifty. Sach
questions shall bo prepared by the Justices
of the Supreme Court and at each exami
nation shall Oe the same for each appli
cant, and no applicant shall be admitted
to practice by the Supreme Co'irt wno
does not correctly answer three-founhs of
the questions submitted to him, nor sha 1
the same set of questions be used a second
time within live years from their first use.
Senator Dickinson, with a view to pro
vdina permanent camp-* of instruction
and sites for target practice for the militia,
to-day offered the following bill:
The Adjutant-Genera! and two p-rsons to be
appointed by the Governor, one of whom shall
be a resident ol LcÂ» Angeles and the other a
resident of San Francisco, are hereby ap
pointed commissioners lor the purpose of
sen ciiug and acquiring, by donation or pur
chase, two suitable sites ior camps of instruc
tion aud target practice for the National
Guard of the State of Ca ifornia. One of such
sites shall be the one, in the judgment of said
commissioners, most available for the troops
of the northern part of the State and the other
for the southern part of the State. Said com
missioners *ha:l also have the power to make
such improvements on the grounds and the
approaches thereto and erect such buildings
thereon as will put the property so selected in
a condition suitable for the reception of or
ganizations oi the National Guard ordered to
camps of instruction and for target practice.
The bill carries an appropriation of
$40,000.
Senator Pedlar evidently has an idea
that the office of attorney for the State
Board of Health and the Board of Health
of San Francisco is a sinecure, and to-day
introduced a bill aboiishinz that position.
If the bill is passed it will save $3000 a
year to the State.

The Nerves of Life
IT IS A GOOD THING FOR EVERY ONE TO
I know that when they worry or Iret or over- .
exhaust their train they afreet these nerves,
because these nerves originate in the brain
and are distributed to the throat, lungs, liver,
heart and stomach. If people would really
study the human anatomy more and be less
prudish they would live better and longer
fives. It is only a little wnile ago that tha
Puritan would cover the uprights of a piano
so that no one could see its extremities in bold
outline. These days have passed away ani
men and women are leading better lives and
are leading more accurate lives. We espe-
cially appeal to young men. YOUNG MAN,
have you a true discernment of the difficulties
with which you have surrounded yourself?
Do you realize that your nights of dissipation
and no sleep hive brought on your present
decline? Have you erred in youth? Have
you exhausted your nerve forces? If you have
abused yourself, kept too late hours or dissi-

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 25.â 1n his
opening prayer in the Senate this, morn
ing the chaplain referred to the illness of
the senior Senators from Indiana and
Mississippiâ Messr.-. Yoorhees and George
â and to the tribute to be paid to-day to
ex-Speaker Crisp of Georgia, giving
thanks for "the army of noble men who
have served and are serving this nation."
Cardinal Gibbons, wearing the red skull
cap of his orHce, occupied for a few
minutes a seat in the diplomatic gallery,
and ex-Sena;or Henderson of Nebraska a
seat in the reserved gallery.
A communication was laid before the
Senate from the Attorney-General in re
spouse to a resolution of Saturday last in
relation to the foreclosure proceedings in
the case of the Union Pacific Railroad
Company.
Burrows (R.) of Michigan presented
petitions on the subject of the Senatorial
election in Delaware, and Chandler (R.) of
New Hampshire gave notice that it was
his purpose to suggest to the Senate
wheth er some methods cannot be estab
lished to "prevent the wholesale larceny of
senatorships in various States.'"
Pettigrew (Sil.) of Soutn Dakota offered
a resolution for a special committee of
five Senators to inquire into the issue of
land patents to the Pacific railroads and
to the California and Oregon Railroai,
and to the diversion from the reports of
gross earnings of the sums paid to the Pa
c;fic Mail Steamship Company. Referred.
Cbandier (R.) of New Hampsnire intro
duced a bill, which was referred to the
Judiciary Committee, providing that no
person shall be tried in courts cf the
United States for acts in aid of the Cuban
Fi.epublic.
Ihe Military Academy appropriation
bill was taken up, the pending question
being on the position of the West
Point cadets in the approaching inaugural
ceremonies.
After remarks by Thurs ton (R.) of Ne
braska in support of the amendment the
bi 1 was laid aside to give Turpie (D.) of
Indiana an opportunity to address the
Senate in regard to Cuban matters.
It was 12:35 p. m. when Senator Turpie
took the floor to make his promised speech
on our relations wild Cuba. The galleries
were scarcely one-quarter filled, and the
Senator's thin, non-resonant voice was
drowned in the opening paragraphs oy
ihe buzz ol conversation on tne floor. He
read a voluminous tyce-written manu
script, asserting that evun before the pur
chase of Florida by the United States,
Spain's title to Cuba was no more valid
than to Chile, Colombia and Mexico, but
after thai event its title became much
more dilapidated.
The Declaration of Independence of the
United States, he c'aimed. was for every
people to ebtab'.ish a Government of
its choice and there cou.d be no crime
asainst municipal law or against the Gov
ernment disavowed by buch a decree.
S;nce 1850 there had not been ten years of
continuous peace in Cuba, and hundreds
of thousands of citizens of that country
had taken up arms to assert their rights
and stop existing forms of tyranny and
despotism.
What then, he asked, was the duty of
Congress in the premises? The constitu
tional power given by Congress to regu
late commerce wnn foreign nations, cc
declared with much emptias's. included
the fc m of recognition of governments.
â¢He elaborated upon ibe definition o: the
word "commerce,'' with some brief illus
trations dtrived from t c use of the term
. as applied between the sexes, and which
raised a titter of laughter, and with num
erous references to the legal definitions of
the term "commerce," as construed by the
courts.
Considering the clear language of the
constitution â which conferred upon Con
press the law-making power, not the law
passing power, Hiia thai a veto could al
ways- be overridden by a two-thirds vote â
i: was plain to him, he said, that there
was a scheme in the constitution for gov
ernment by Congress alone as well as srov
erument by the President and Conere^ in
unison. The President might make a
treaty and Congress confirm it, but Con
gress could the next dny repeal it.
At this point the Senator became ener
getic, and brought his tist down on his
desk with much iorce, which scattered
his noted in every direction, but a couple
ol active pages picked up bis notes, and
Mr. lurpie continued bis remarks, which
were listened to with much interest by
those on the Democratic side.
The Senator concluded by saying that
ho had not originally approved the form
of the Senator from Pennsylvania's
(Cameron) resolution, but approved of the
effect of it.
Tne hour of 2 p. M. having now arrived,
the Nicaragua canal Dill was laid before
the Senate, but on request of Morgan (D.)
of Alabama was postponed until to-mor
row.
Then Tnrpie began the second part of
his speech on the President's relation to
Congress in regard to the? recognition of
Cuban beliigerencv. He illustrated the
existing state of affairs in Cuba, contend
ing that seventeen years aeo the Spaniards,
by agreeing to an exchange of prisoners,
had recoenized Cuban belligerency. He
compared the two troche erected by Wey
ler to the wall built by Roman in Britain
to keep out the Scots, and said the object
of the trochas was plainly to prevent the
capture of Havana by thie forces of the
Cuban republic.
He dencunceu Weyler as a diminutive
rapttle, who used his sword against wo
men and children and fcught the enemy
with paper pellets, and said that Weyler's
ppology for Zertucha's betrayal ot Maceo
by stating that Maceo feli in "loyal bat
â¢ tie" was a recognition of belligerency and
an acknowledgment of the existing con
dition of war.
Speaking of the recognition of the bel
ligerency of the Cubans by the United
States he said it would enable them to
issue letters of marque and drive Spain's
commerce from tue oceans, Bnd would
leaa finally to the recognition of a new
nationality.
It being now 3 P. M. Mr. Turpie sus
pended his speech, and, after receiving
the President's message giving the list of
persons claiming to be American citizens
arrested in Cuba, the Senate suspended
business to listen to entogies on the late
ex-Speaker Crisp, and immediately after
adjourned until to-morrow.

to be constitutional and within the juris
diction of State courts to enforce.
The case at the bar came up from the
Northern District of California uoon the
appeal of Robert Robertson, P. H. Olsen,
J. H. Bradley and Morris Hansen irom
the judgment of the United States court
for that district, refusing to discharge
them from the custody of Barry Baldwin,
United States Marshal, on their petition
for a writ of habeas corpus.
These men signed articles in San Fran
cisco to ship on the American barkentine
Arago for a voyage to Knappton, Wash.,
thence to Valparaiso, Chile, and to such
other foreign ports as the master might
direct, and return to a port of discharge
in the United States.
At Astoria, Or., the men deserted the
vessel, and being arrested on a warrant,
issued by a Justice of the Peace, were held
in irons sixteen days and returned to San
Francisco. On the way there they refused
to work, and on arrival were he!d in cus
tody by a United States Commissioner for
trial upon the charge of violation of sec
tions 4593 and 4.595 ofthe Revised Statutes.
They sued lor their discharge on a writ of
habeas corpus, on the ground that their
detention was in violation of the thir
teenth amendment to the constitution,
which forbids involuntary servitude, ex
cept for crime of which tne subject has
been duly convicted. Judge Morrow dis
missed tneir petition and remanded them
to the custoJy of Barry Baldwin, Marshal
lor that district.
Justice .Brown delivered the opinion of
the court; Justice Harlan dissented. Dis
posing of the question of jurisdiction,
Justice Brown said the statute giving
Justices of the Peace jurisdiction of com
plaints against seamen for violation of
iheir contracts was within the "judicial
power" of the UniUd States, and that
Congress lawfully authorizes State courts
to issue warrants, sucn as the one upon
whicti tue petitioners were arrested in
Oregon and returned to their vessel.
Tne next question was what constituted
"involuntary servitude," which was pro
hibited in the thirteenth amendment in
the opinion of the court. It attached to
servitude which was involuntary at the
inception of the contract. It was true
that there might be no remedy, if the con
tracting party escaped from the control
of the person with whom he had con
tracted, and that the contract might be
considered null a*nd void, not in accord
with public policy, but these considera
tions could not make the service con
tracted for involuntary servitude.
"If the terms wer? to be construed by
the party affected," said the court, "and
the contract terminated in his election, a
man ought not be able to contract for a
personal service, and to surrender his per
sonal liberty, even for a brief period under
certain conditions specified in the con
tract. By such condition a soldier might
desert his command on the eve of battle,
and however satisfactory that might be to
him, it could hardly be considered as
tending to the good discipline or effective
ness of the army. "
Practice and precedents extend bacfc
into the periods of antiquity, said Justice
Brown, and concurred in holding seamen
to the terms of their contracts. Naviga
tion could not be carried on without the
enforcement of contracts and the author
ity ofthe law in question was found in the
constitutional power to regulate foreign
and interstate commerce. These codes of
all maritime nations, from the earliest
age to the present period, contained simi
lar propositions, and in view of all tne
conditions involved in tne case, the opin
ion concluded, the court found the ar
rest and imprisonment of the petitioners
wit h involuntary servitude forbidden by
tne thirteenth amendment to the consti
tution, and the judgment ofthe court of
the Northern District of California was
affirmed.
In bis dissent Justice Harlan laid much
stress upon the importance of consequence
invoived in the decision of the court. He
denied the relevancy of reference to laws
passed by the Hanseatic League 400 years
ago, or even the Colonial Council of Mas
sachusetts 200 years ago, relating to the
laws ol seamen. These laws, he said, had
been passed in 1797, and had been permit
ted to remain upon the statute-books, in
his opinion, for want of consideration,
largely. He asked what diSerence there
was, in essence, between the overseer
standing over a man with lash in his hand
and compelling him to !aoor against his
will and the United States Government
through its Marshal compelling a man to
perform a contract which be no longer
wished to observe.
Discussing the possibilities of legislation
upon tue principles of tbe decision of the
court Judge Harlan called attention to
the va-tly wider field that waa open to
State Legislatures wnich were restricted
only by what was specifically prohibited
to them, compared with Congress, which
acted only on delegated powers. Wnat a
sensation, he asked, would result from
the passage by a State Legislature of
a law authorizing the arrest of a do
mestic employe who had contracted
for six months' service, but who had
at tbe end of a month, for reasons sat
isfactory to himself or herself, decided
to abandon the contract. Yet he asserted
that the right of the Slate to do this rested
upon just as solid a oasis as th- decision
of the court in this case. The English
Parliament was all-powerful, and by a
ten-line statute tniirht wipe out the magna
cbarta, and there was no legal power to
say it nay. In this country the legislative
department had no power whatever, ex
cept only such as was conferred on it by
tbe constitution, and that, be contended,
did not give Congress the right to pass a
law which compelled one man to serve
another against vis will. It was a matter
purely of personal and private contract.

Mrs. Nellie Bartlett Files
a Sensational Suit
at Eureka.
Asks the Court to Annul Her
Marriage to Her Pres
ent Husband.
Learned After Wedding H m That
Another Han Still Cla.m d
Her as His Wife.
EUREKA, Cal., Jan. 25.â Mrs. Nellie
Bartlett has recently made the startling
discovery that Bickford Bartlett, a weal
thy rancher of Arcata who married her
over three years ago and by whom she hai
a child 2 years old, ia not now and never
has been her husband in the eyes of the
law. Instead of beine a gay young grans
widow at the time of her marriage to
Bartlett she was still the wife of another
and had unconsciously committed big
amy. The case is not one of the "Enoch
Arden" order or of the dead returned to
liie, but is simply the outgrowth of the
law's delay, coupled with a misunder
standing on the part of Mrs. Wood or
Bartlett or, more properly speaking, Miss
Nellie Houghton, for that was her maiden
name, which she had resumed previous to
her marriage to Bartlett. The story is
brought out in the suit which she has in
stituted to annul her marriage with Bart
lett
On March 4, 1888, Nellie Houghton, then
18 years old, and Samuel DeÃome Wood
who was many years her senior, were mar
ried at Philadelphia. They lived together
until 1893, when the wife brought suit for
a divorce, and in July of that year, the
testimony being all in, the case was given
to the Master in Chancery. Her attorneys
had assured her that the divorce would be
granted, and when afterward they in
formed her that the case had been given
to thÂ« Master in Chancery she understood
that to mean that she had obtained the
coveted decree.
In the meantime she had come to Hum
bold t, where she met Bickford Bartlett;
their admiration was mutual, and, believ
ing herself a sinele woman, she married
him in August, 1893. It was not until re
cently that, through her mother, she
learned that at the time of this last mar
riage there was a man in Pennsylvania
who still had the legal right to call her his
wife. The Master in Chancery there did
not file his report granting the divorce
until the following November, or two
months after the second marriage.
It would add to the romance of the
affair if it could be said that the plaintiff
was taking these legal steps in order to
rectify a mistake and begin married life
over again, but unfortunately such is not
the object of the suit.
SAN JOSE CHARITY SCHEME.
Co-Operation of Supervisors Desired in
the Distnbutton of Aid to
Indigents.
SAN JOSE, Cal,, Jan. 25.â Rev. H. Mel
ville Tenney and S. B. Hunkins of the As
sociated Charities, Mrs. Ben Cory and
Mrs. F. D. S. Williams of the Ladies'
Benevolent Society, and Mrs. W. B. Hiil
of the Catholic Ladies' Aid Society ap
peared before the Board of Supervisors
this morning, and urged it to co-operate
with them in dispensing aid to the indi
gent. It is claimed that a great many un
worthy persons obtained relief from the
Supervisors through deception and fraud,
and it is desired to have the board dis
pense the relief it does in the city under
the direction of the various benevolent
societies, in order to prevent this imposi
tion. They wanted the Supervisors to
join with delegates from the various
benevolent societies and elect an investi
gator, whose duty it should be to exam
ine the cases of all applicants for relief,
and that no aid be granted unless the case
was favorably reported upon by the in
vestigator. It was pointed out that fre
quently from $500 to $1000 was given to
indigents in the county, and the ladies
believed that their system of dispensing it
would be a saving to the taxpayers.
Supervisors Stern. Austin and Rea were
appointed a committee to meet with the
representatives of the benevolent societies
at the Associated Charities next Wednes
day a.ternoon and discuss the plan.

ADDED TO STANFORD'S MUSEUM.
Students Uncover the Fossif Mastodon
Tusk Recently Discovered
Near Mayfis/d.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
25. â A party of students this morning
unearthed tlie fossil mastodon tusk, which
was discovered a mile and a hal! west of
Mayneid about a mouth atro. The tusk
was imbedded in tertiary gravel in the
Dottom of a ravine. Two ends badly de
composed were showing, and as they
were about foarteen feet apart it was
thought that a pair of tusks had been dis
covered. The investigations of the stu
dents showed, however, that the ends be
longed to the same tusk.
The party after much hard digging suc
ceeded in uncovering the tusk. It was
found that a middle quarter had been en
tirely destroyed by the action of the
water in the ravine. Tyro pieces were
fairly well preserved, one about four feet
in length and the other rive feet. They
were carried to a secluded place within
easy reach of the road. A wagon will be
sent for them and they will be transported
to the Stanford mastam, to be kept there
as relics.
Scientific men have abundant proof in
the way of similar fossils that mastodons
and elephants once inhabited this par' of
the country. Tnit discovery will simply
add to the proof already obtained.

IN DRUNKEN RAGE
INVITED DEATH
Supposed Burglar Shot at
Fresno Was Only a
Reveler.
Attempted to Enter the Wrong
House When Stupid From
Intoxicants.
Dies in Jail Frcm Wounds Inicted
by the Owner of the
Dwel ing.
FRESNO. Cal., Jan. 25.â Fred Bauraan,
who was shot in the legs last night by
William Hill, a colonist, who mistook
him for a burglar, died this morning at
the county jail. At first it was believed
that his wounds were not serious, but
hemorrhage set in, and he died in his cell
sometime before the day jailer made his
morning rounds.
Bauman was undoubtedly innocent of
burglarious intent, but Hill had every
reason to believe differently. Bauman
was a hard-working and honest man, and
has been employed at the Helm ranch for
several months. On Sunday he came to
town and became considerably under the
influence of liquor.
He started for home last night, and it
is believed that he lost his way. He un
doubtedly thought, in his drunten
stupor, that he was at home when try
ing to enter the colonist's house. He bad
always borne a good reputation, and his
untimely death is very much regretted.
Mr. Hill was exonerated by a Coroner's
jury to-nigbt.
Bauman first went to the front door of
the house, and Mr. Hill, having in mind
the recent hold-ups in this city, at once
came to the conclusion that the visitant
was a burglar. He ordered the intruder
away, but, instead oi leaving, Bauman
went around to the back >ard.
Mr. Hill then armed himself with a
shotgun and going to tha rear of the
porch ordered Bauman to leave. The
supposed burglar started off, but returned
a few minutes later. Then the colonist
again ordered him to ieave the place.
Bauman began swearing and started
toward Hill, exclaiming:
"I'll fix you."
As he advanced the rancher warned
him to stop or he would shoot. To this
the stupefied man paid no heed, and in
self-defense Hill fired at his legs, filling
them with shot.
The colonist immediately brouefit his
victim to the County Jail, where his
wounds were dressed. Believing that
they were not serious, the jailer put Bau
man on a cot in a ceil, where he was found
dead thiÂ« morning. Mr. Hill had not
known Bauraan and conld not see in the
darkness that we was under the influence
of liquor.
Bauman was a Swede and 27 years of age.

FORGER SANDERS'
CLEVER SCHEME
Tried to Hire Witnesses
to Establish His In
nocence.
Prosecution Finds a Statement
Which He Wrote for Their
Guidance.
Taken From the Convict's Cellmate,
Who Was to Hive Conducted
the Negotiations.
FRESNO, CAL., Jan. '25.â Professor
Sanders' hope of freedom, based on the
Supreme Court ruling' ordering his third
trial lor forgery, has seemingly gone a-
Elinimerinjr. Special Counsel Hinds came
into court with a large-sized bomb this
morning, and he proceeded to hurl it in
the direction of the defense without delay.
In his opening statement to the jury he
told of new evidence discovered since the
second trial, exposing a scheme whereby
the man twice convicted ol attaching
William Wootton's signature to a valu
able paper and who is suspected of know
ing what became of the missing rancher,
hoped to establish his innocence to the
satisfaction of the jury.
The substance of the new evidence is
that Sanders several months ago had for
a cellmate Robert Anderson, who was
sent to the State's prison for stabbing a
young man named Berry at a dance in
Kingsburg. Anderson did not expect to
be convicted and Professor Sanders was
of the same opinion.
They entered into an acreement where
by the former was, upon his release from
jail, to go to Los Angeles ana try to get
two men to swear in Sanders' behalf. They
â¢were to testify tbat they bad seen John
Gnausch, Graves and William Wootton in
Los Angeles after the disappearance of
tbeÃeedley rancher.
District Attorney Snow has in his pos
session the statements alleged to have
been drawn by Professor Sanders, in his
unmistakable handwriting, which these
witnesses were to memorize and recite on
the stand. To strengthen this evidence,
Sanders is said to have written in large
print on a sheet of brown pap6r a notice
-offering a reward for tiie return of certain
letters and papers which had been lost on
the street.
In each corner of the paper the defend
ant had punched a hole, to make it ap
pear tbat the notice had been nailed to a
post- The two witnesses whom Ander
son was to find were to testify that, be
sides seeingWootton, Knausch and Graves,
they had torn this notice off a teieeraph
pole in Los Aigeles. It was signed and
had been placed there, according to the
statements prepared by Sanders, by one
of these three. Anderson was to get the
three witnesses and Sanders agreed to pay
him to do so.
Attorney Hinds displayed the state
ments Sanders is accuseJ o: having manu
factured, but did not read them to the
jury. The prosecution declares there is
no question that the wriling is that of the
defendant.
These important papers and statements
were discovered on Anderson's person
when he was searched before being taken
to the penitentiary. They were sewed in
a tobacco bag in his shirt. It is under
stood that since then Anderson has con
fessed. He was not able to carry out his
part of tue agreement with Sanders be
cause of his conviction.
Of course if the defendant could have
produced two more witnesses who had
seen Wootton alive alter his disappear
ance from his ranch, and proved that
Knausch and Graves were not myths,
Sanders could not be guilty of forgery or
any other crime in connection with the
case.
Attorneys Hinds and Short enlivened
the proceedings considerably to-day witn
their numerous byplays and side com
ments directed at each other. First Judge
Webb asked them to desist, then he
warned them and finally be sternly or
dered them to obey. He remarked that
the attorneys knÂ§w batter than to act as
they did.
Tne opening statement of Attorney
Hinds was comparatively brief. He gave
a clear outline of what the prosecution ex
pected to prove, the evidence except for
that just discovered being abont the same
as that adduced at Sanders' 6econd triaj.
SACRAMENTO MONGOL'S CRIME.
Attempts io Defraud a Chinese Merchant
end Uses a Revolver When
Detected.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 25.â Hong
Kee, a wealthy Chinese merchant, who
fox upward of twenty years has been en
gaged in business in the old mining town
of Folsom, barely escaped joining his
Celestial ancestors Saturday nigbt. His
assailant. Ah Sun, is incarcerated in the
county jail, charged with attempted mur
der.
Ab Sun purchased a quantity of first
grade opium from the merchant, toot it
home, removed a portion and substituted j
an equal portion of a low grade of the
drug, and then returned to the store with
the mixture and demanded a return of hb
money. On being refused he drew a re
volver and fired at Hong Kee, who saved
his life by a quiet turn of the body, tne
bullet "-carrinq his chest.
Ah Sun, supposing tUat he had accom
plished his murderous purpose, fled to his
cabin, removed the discharged shell, sub
stituted a fresh cartridge, and was mat
ing preparaiions for flight, when Deputy
Sheriff H. N. Burke, who had been in
formed of the attempted murder, entered
the front door of his cabin.
As soon as Ah Sun saw the officer he
dashed out of the back door into the dark
ness closely followed by the official.
A hot chase across the fields ensued, the
officer following his man by sound.
Eventually the wouidbe murderer ran in
to a wire fence an.l was overtaken aud
aiter a struggle disarmed.
Hong Kee came to this city to-day and
a meeiing jf the tong to vr hicn he belonged
was called. For a time war was imminent,
but eventuailv the matter was arranged
in Chinese fashion. It is understood that
Ah Sun must suffer at aha bands of the
white man's laws.

FATHER AND SON fN JAIL
Postmaster Draper and His Boy Are Ac
cused of Stealing the Funds of
the Cheyenne Office.
CHEYENNE, Wto., Jan. 25.âPost
master Georgre A. Draper and his son.
Charles A. Draper, assistant postmaster
at this place, were arrested to-night by
Inspectors McMechen and Waterbury of
Denver, charged with the tljeft of a regis
tered package containing $3552.
The registered package in question con
tained the surplus funds of the Cheyenne
postoffice for the last quarter, and was put
up here by the postmaster in the presence
of two witnesses for transmission to Chi
cago on the 16th inst.
The registered pouch remained in the
Cheyenne office in a vault to which the
Postmaster and his son had access for
several hours before train time. When
the pouch reached Chicago it was found
to have been cut open and the package
abstracted.
Suspicion was directed to Draper by the
fact that he has heretofore made his re
mittances by draft. Investigation shows
that the list upon which he kept the list
of his remittances on was dcctored.
He made large deposits in the banks,
and a large number of bills deposited
were identical with those remitted, except
that the numbers were transposed.
Mr. Draper and his son were suspended
from .service and the office placed in
charge of the bondsman.
BIG CAR SHOPS BURNED.
One of ihe Foremen Is Overcome by ihe
Heat and Perishesâ Many Men Will
Lose Employment
PLATTSMOUTH, Nebr., Jan. 25.â
The Burlington and Missouri River Rail
road's carshops in this city were totally
destroyed to-night. Nine coaches were
undergoing repairs at the time, of which
number two were saved. George Flech
ner, one of the foremen, was overcome
by the immense heat and perished. It is
estimated that the loss wilt exceed
$125,000.
The alarm was turned in soon after 9
o'clock by parties who noticed the blaze
breaking out in the coachhouse. There
was a :-trong wind blowing and it was
feared that other buildings would burn
also.
Telegrams were sent to Chief Redell at
Omaha, but later countermanded, when
this department with the aid of the shop
men hemmed in the burning district and
gained control of the flames. Scores of
workmen are thrown out of employment
by this disaster. It is thought probable
that the railroad will rebuild, at once on
the same site.
The blackened corpse of George Flech
ner, after the fire i.ad been put out, was
found in the ruins. It is supposed that he
was suffocated with smoke when his com
rades were pushing some of the rolling
stock out of reach of the flame?. No one
noticed his absence, and the man perished.
A PLAY BVDELY TERMINATED.
Actor Henley Arretted on a Charge of
Grand Larceny.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 25.â The large
audience which had assembled in Wal
lace's Theater this evening to witness the
first performance of Miss Margaret
Mather's revival of " Cymbeline " was
dismissed at 9 o'clock owing to the ar
rest on a charge of grand larceny of Ed
ward J. Henley, who was to play the
role of lachimo.
The errest wa? made as Mr. Henley was
pnterinc the stage door of the theater at
7:30 o'clock. He was taken to the West
Thirtieth-street police station, where,
ow ing to the charge being felony, bail was
refused. Efforts were made by C. W.
Burnham, manager of the theater, and by
friends to procure the attendance at tiie
police station of a magistrate, but their
efforts were unavailing.
After holding the audience until 9
o'clock it was decided that an announce
ment be ruade from the stage that the per
lormance would ba postponed until to
morrow evenin.-. While the announce
ment was being made Miss Mather was in
her dressine-room, almost prostrated.
Mrs. Hoffman Martin says she advanced
$50 to Henley while he was rehearsing in
her company at the Murray Hill Theater,
and received an order from him on Miss
Mather for the amount. She said that she
had presented the order to Miss Mather
and that it had been repudiated.
The manager offered to settle the in
debtedness at once, but the detective said
tbat the warrant called for the arrest of
Henley, and that he would have to take
him to the police station. It was pro
posed that the detective stand in the
wines and permit Mr. Henley to go
! through the performance before he was
removed to the station, but this was
positively refused. The messengers were
sent in all directions for a magistrate to
j take bail, bnt none could be found.
Henley, while he was a prisoner this
evening, said: "This woman has been
i threatening me for several days, by letter
and verbally. I shall prosecute her to the
full extent of the law for false imprison
ment, and lam surprised that a magis
trate would issue a warrant on such a
case."
Mrs. Hoffman Martin came to this city
from Han Francisco. She is the widow of
John Martin, a California millionaire, for
whose murder by poison she was tried
and acquitted, and afterward was engaged
in extensive litigation in the Weet.

STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 25.â There was
but one question be. ore the Grand Lod>e
of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith
to-day, and that concerned the endow
ment feature. At present a $2000 policy is
paid on endowments, and an assessment
of $2 50 is levied upon each member.
The younger members of the order pro
test that they should not be assessed as

of B'nai B'rith.
heavily as those who are much nearer the
grave, and it is claimed that this general
assessment has kept many eligible He
brews from the lodge.
This forenoon's session was occupied by
a lengthy exposition of the subject by Mr.
Gutstadt, the chairman of the press en
dowment committee. He was in favor of
allowing the policy to stand as it has
been, but of arranging a gradual scale of
assessments.
This afternoon the speakers were limited
to ten minutes each, and many gave their
views upon the mooiea question. The
general opinion was that a change should
be made; that the policy should b- left
undisturbed, but that the assessments
should be graduated. The bone of con
tention proved to be just what plan to
follow in readjusting the as s essments.
The discussion was continued until 6:30
o'clock this evening, when the report of
the conference committee on endowment
was adopted, together with an amend
ment proposed by Sol Levy of Washoe
Lodge No. 450. The report, which is of
interest to all members of the ordtr, is as
follows:
Firstâ That it Is the sense of the committee
of the wbole that no plan reducing or scaling
the endowment of $2000 after paying ihe rate
required be entertained.
Secondâ That we are opposed to complete
op lonal endowment, but iavor the existing
law relating thereto.
Thirdâ That the full rate of endowment of
$2000 be maintained.
Fourthâ That ihe management of the endow
ment tund remain in the hands of thy .\I. \V.
District Grand Lodge.
Fifthâ That a classified scale of rates be
charged according to age.
Sixthâ That we recommend the adoption of
the following schedule of rates for an endow
ment of $2000: 18 to 22 years of age, inclusive,
$175; 23 to 27, inclusive, $2; 28 to 32, in
clusive, $2 30; 33 to 35, inclusive, $2 50;
38 to 42, inclusive, $2 80 ; 43 to 47, inclusive,
$3; 48 to 52, inclusive, $3 25; 52 and over,
$3 50.
The amendment proposed by Mr. .Levy,
and adopted, relates only to members who
may hereafter join the order. It provides
for optional graduated endowments of
$500, $1000, |1500 and $2000.
To-night tne members held their grand

OLD ARMAGOSA'S
GOLDEN LEDGES
Rich Strike Reported From
the Lower Panamint
Mountains.
Pay Dirt Found in a Claim Well
Known in the Days of
Forty-Nine.
Had Been Abandoned After Its Quartz-
Mill Was Destroyed- by
Indians.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 25.â Parties
just in from the lower Panamint Moun
tains, where they have been working in
the old Amargosa mine owned by LO3 An
gees people, bring flattering news of a
rich strike at this claim. T ey say they
have opened up a six-foot vein, the ore
assaying $115 per ton. This mine is one
of the old-timers and has made a wide
reputation. It is well known to all pio
neer milling meg, having been worked in
the early 50' s.
The first quartzmiil ever erected in
Southern California was hauled from San
.Francisco by wagon and placed on this
property. The mill was very crude, being
mostly of wood, with iron shoes and dies.
The freighting cost 25 cents a pound. At
that time forts were built to protect the
men from the Indians.
The ore produced from the mine then
was fabulously rich. Much gold was
taken out up to the time the mill was
destroyed by the Indians. Sine 1 then the
mine has been cosed down until the pres
ent owners took hold of the property.
They intend to build a mill and reopen
the claim.
The vein just opened shows permanency
and richness. To the north of the Amar
eosa is the Confidence mine, owned by
Salt Lake people. A large plant of ma
chinery has been placed on this property.
Tne Panamint country has long been
known as one of the richest mineral sec
tions of California, and while it was worked

VISITS G ROVER CLEVELAND.
Ex-Queen Liliuokalani Pays Her Respects
to the President, and Thanks Him
for Past Courtesies.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 25.-Ex-
Qneen Liliuokalani paid a personal visit
to President Cleveland to-day. It was en
tirely informal, and it was so designated
in the note sent by the deposed monarch
to the President requesting the privilege
of calling, and the answer of tue latter in
granting it.
Hel/uli, agent and secretary of Liliuoka
lani, and Julius N. Palmer of Boston, the
American friend of ibe Queen who accom
panied her to Washington, went to the
White House this morning with an auto
graDh note from the ex-Queen addressed
to the President.
She asked merely that he receive her in
formally in a personal capacity, basing
the request on the ground that it was a
custom in her country for the head of the
government to receive foreign visitors of
distinction. Shortly after noon the Pres
ident sent a note to Mr. Heliule appoint
ing 3 o'clock as the hour he would be
pleased to have her call.
At the appointed time, Liliuokalani,
Miss Kai Nahoalana, her companion-in
waiting, Mr. Heliule and Mr. Palmer
drove up to the White House in a car
riage, and were immediately shown to the
Blue Room. The ex-Queen was tastefully,
dressed. She walked with dignity across
the lobby to the private corridor.
The meeting between the President and
the former Queen was extremely cordial.
Mr. Cleveland, enuring the room, ad
vanced with outstretched band, and as he
grasped that of Lit iuofcalam he exclaimed :
"I 8m very plad you thought of calling
on me"
The President invited the ex-Queen and
her companions to be seated, and then en
tered inio a pleasant conversation with
the former. They talked about the death
of Minister Willis, and the ex-Queen spoke
of him in words of praise: "Yes; another
word, Mr. Cleveland, he always filled what
ever position he held with credit to him
self and his country."
There was nothing said about her res
toration, but the ex-Queen took occasion
to thank the President for the withdrawal
of the annexation treaty from the Senate,
sent by Mr. Harrison four years ago.
In reply to a question about Mrs. Cleve
land's health the President remarked shei
had been prep&r ing to go out before he went
downstairs. He sent a messenger who
informed him that Mrs. Cleveland had
gone out walking a few minutes before.
These things formed the bulk of a conver
sation that was informal and personal
from beginning to end.
SEQUEL TO A CONFIDENCE GAME.
Real Estate Broker Arrested at Omaha for
His Connection With a Gang of
Swindlers.
OMAHA, Nebb., Jao. 25 Georee Hack
ett, a real-estate broker of this city, was
arrested to-night for conspiracy on an in
dictment found by the Grand Jury at
Ogden, Utah, last June. Behind the case
is the story of an alleged confidence game
in which one Charles L. Blazier, now serv
ing a ten-years' sentence in the Utah
Penitentiary for obtaining money under
false pretenses, is said to have been the
principal and Hackett the stool-pigeon.
According to Hackett he met Bl; z:er in
Denver in 1891, where Blazier was doing a
land-office business as a mining broker.
Blazier removed to Oerden and later
opened a correspondence with Hackett,
which terminated in Blazier employing
Hackett as cashier in a bans to be opened
at Ogden, which was to be known as the
"Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank."
R. E. Moulton, a wealthy stock man of
Ogden was induced to deposit $20,000 in
negotiable notes for trie bank, receiving in
exchange bank stock for the amount.
Th-re were others who followed Moui
ton's footsteps into the bank.
In about two weeks toe bank vaults
were filled and G. L. Blazier. J. H. Steil
inesand G. T. Harris disappeared sud
denly together with tne money leaving
Hackett and Moulton to i old the sack.
Plackett was afraid to remain because of

Whips Ernie Stanton in fifteen Mound*
Before Â» London Club. -
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 35.â The fight be
tween Pedlar Palmer and Ernie Stanton
came off to-night before the National
Sporting Club and resulted in a victory
for Palmer in the fifteenth round.
The men fought at 117 pounds for a
stake of $300 a side and a purse of $500
given by tue club. Both are English. In
October Palmer defeated Johnny Murphy
of Boston in a fiehtfor the bantam-weight
championship of the world, the English
man being awarded the battle on points
at the end of the twentieth round.
In the fi ht to-nieht- Palmer was the
favorite in the betting, odds of 9 to 4 be
ing laid on him. Both men were in
splendid condition. Palmer led the
iiehting from the start and his superior
skill was immediately apparent .In the
first round he landed three times on Stan
ton's face, and in the third round drove a
blow nome on his nose, causing it to bleed.
Palmer's smartness enab.ed him to avoid
the blows aimed at him by his opponent,
while at the same time he delivered his
own blows freely.
Stanton's strength enabled him to take
the punishment Palmer administered to
him, but tie did not land a single clean
blow for six roun Is. The fight was in
Palmer's hands throughout.
In the tenth round the spectators saw
that Stanton had no chance of winning
on his merits. The odds in favor of
Palmer had at the end of the tenth round
risen to 4 to 1.
Irs the fifteenth round Palmer knocked
Staiiton down twice, whereupon the
referee stopped the light and declared
Palmer t. c winner.

j A Marvelous Feat in Telegraphy â News of Little Pete's
Death Wired to the Emperor of Chinaâ See Yups
. Arrested in Consequence and an Account
of the Government's Action Wired
Backâ All Within \2
Hours.
Yesterday morning the San Francisco Examiner, so deservedly
dubbed the "Monarch of the Fakers," on account of a long, pea-green
record for lurid, flashy articles with absolutely no foundation in fact,
came out with a two-column, double-leaded story with startling head
lines, to the effect that the relatives in China of all those suspected of
responsibility for the death of "Little Pete" had been cast into dun
geons. In revolting and grotesque detail the article pictured the pres
ent situation in Chinatown, told of how the highbinders plotted their
crimes and carried them out, stated the inability of the police to cope
with the difficulties that confronted them, and ended with the assertion
that the Emperor of China accomplished what the President of the
United States tails to do by punishing the innocent in Peking that there
may be peace in the Chinese slums of San Francisco.
"At 6 o'clock yesterday morning," reads paragraph that at
tracted the most attention, "the Chinese Consul telegraphed the facts
of the murder to the Minister at Washington. Early in the afternoon
word came back that in China every immediate relative of the local
president and secretary of the See Yups was under arrest."
When this remarkable fact became known to the local Consul
>eneral and Vice Consul General they were struck dumb. They
v nched themselves to see if they had not fallen into a trance, but it
was not so. Then they consulted with each other relative to seeing a
physician and undergoing treatment for loss of memory.
The employes of the Western Union Telegraph Company, on read
ing the Examiner story, were simply astounded. Never in all their
experience had they heard of so remarkable an occurrence in the his
tory of telegraphy. At 6A. M. the Consul General had telegraphed the
facts of "Little Pete's" murder to Yang Yu, the Chinese Minister to
Washington. Then he in turn had sent a cable message by way of
London, thence by a very devious route to the Chinese Governor at
Canton; the Governor had communicated with the Emperor of all the
Chinas on the subject; the ponderous machinery of Government of the
slowest country in the world as regards executive action had been set
to work ; the relatives of those suspected of responsibility for the
death of "Little Pete" had been arrested and cast into prison ; and finally
the news had been sent back to the Minister at Washington and by
him to the local Consul Genefal in the afternoon of the same day, from
which source that hysterical journal, the Examiner, had gleaned the
information which embellished its columns of yesterday.
The fatuous attempt of. the Examiner to dupe the general public
into the belief that it is a world-beater for exclusive news is thoroughly
exposed by the statements of King Owyang, the local Vice Consul
General. He made the following statement yesterday :
"1 was greatly surprised on reading the article in to-day's Exam
iner. The statements were preposterous on their very face, as any
body would know that such a tUing could not take place so soon, much
less have been learned of here.
" Not only has no telegram been sent by the Consul General to our
Minister at Washington, but no one connected with this consulate has
told anybody so. In fact, to my certain knowledge no reporter of the
Examiner was seen yesterday either by the Consul or myself. Ido
not care to draw down the censure of any newspaper on myself or the
i Consul, but am obliged to correct such glaring misstatements of facts."
Nor did the propensity for faking of that worthy journal, the Ex
aminer, end with accomplishing on paper the prodigious feat mentioned
in the foregoing. The local Consul General, under the name of " Fung
Wing Hang (his true name being Fung Yung Heng), was quoted as
making an official statement through his interpeter that the murder of
" Little Pete" was directly due to a "lack of vigilance on the part
of the police in Chinatown." The interpreter's statement that neither
the Consul nor himself saw an Examiner reporter on the day in ques
tion is sufficient of itself to disprove the assertion. Knowing that the
police felt bitter over the alleged statement, King Owyang took occa
sion yesterday to deny its authenticity.
"As I said before," he remarked, "we have seen no one represent
ing the Examiner, and have never at any time said anything deroga
tory to the police in Chinatown. We have no complaint to make of
any lack of vigilance, and, on the contrary, believe they have done
their duty at all times."
Along with its mass of false statements and malicious attacks on
the Police Department the Examiner made one error that is simply
ludicrous and must have been written by some one just waking from a
Rip Van Winkle sleep. A photograph was run of Li Yung Yuen over
the caption of "The Man Marked for the Next Slaughter." Then fol
lowed a two-column paragraph in small type to the effect that he is the
local Consul General and is under the ban for having communicated
the facts of "Little Pete's" death to the Minister at Washington.
Threats were said to have been made openly in Chinatown "that the
next man that shall taste the vengeance of the See Yup Society will be
Li Yung Yen, the Chinese Consul General."
Li Yung Yuen is the ex-Consul General and has been in Havana,
Cuba, for the last four months. When the war there abates enough
for news to reach him of the danger his life is in from San Francisco
highbinders he will doubtless tremble greatly in his embroidered clog
shoes. The present Consul is Fung Yung Heng, or, as the Examiner
flvvould have it, "Fung Wing Hang."
-I Obtaining subscribers by publishing fakes is just like what the
\Statutes call obtaining money by false pretenses.
A CHINESE EDITORIAL ON "LITTLE PETE."
The Chinese Recorder, a weekly published by Mem
Kee & Co. at 847 Dupont street, will contain next Wednes
day an editorial warmly eulogistic of " Little Pete " and con
demning the act that deprived him of life.
The editorial writer of the sheet is a bright young Chi
nese named Ching Ho, who was educated in the missionary
schools. Yesterday he furnished the advance sheet of a
part of the editorial to appear Wednesday, but for certain
reasons best known to himself will not divulge the rest.
Freely translated it reads as follows :
"'Little Pete,' as he was commonly known, was the
most famous man among us. He may have had his faults
and more than the average man, but his good qualities were
more than sufficient to counterbalance the evtf part of his
nature.
" He has furnished more work to those in need than any
man that can be named. When he had no work to give he
\furnished sustenance to the needy. The list of his bad
traits does nowhere contain the word miser.
" It is to be hoped that the police will succeed in catch
ing the murderers and that they will meet with speedy pun
ishment. It is not generally believed, however, that the
two men now under arrest are the guilty ones."

Chief Crowley's Views of the Situa
tionâA Chinese Editorial on
the Dead M n.
It it the general belief of those most con
versant with the status of thines in China
town that the reign of tbe knife, the
hatchet and the secret bullet is at hand.
Rival longs are busy, and these tongs, or
societies, may be likened unto tbe bitter
clans that have often decimated each oth
er's ranks in some such deadly battles as
the Hatfieid-McCoy vendetta in Virginia.
Sergeant Price and six picked men went
into Chinatown at 7 o'clock yesterday
morning resplendent in bright new uni
forms.
This pleased the hatchetmen, and within
an hour notices were posted throughout
Chinatown: "Look out lor Sergeant Price
and his men ! Tbey are dressed like pea
cocks, and are coming to stop the war
among tbe Chinese."
It is the prevailing belief now that tbe
See Yud men will soon lose one of their chief
people, because the Sam Yups have sworn
to avenge tbe deatbof their leader, "Little
Pete."
Chinatown is to-day Infested witb high
binder societies â bands of cunning des
peradoes who live for murder and black
mail. They have thirty or forty meeting
place?, and their notices are posted freely,
without molestation. Many of them sail
under pretense of being merchants' clubs,
and the Police Department bas not yet
felt justified in ordering the doors beaten
in and the bands of highbinders dis
persed.
A few years ago the highbinders were
put to flight by Sergeant Price and his
men, and a year passed without a shot to
disturb the peace. Then the Police De
partment became lenient, ceased visiting
the meeting-places, and desperate high
binders began to hasten to San Francisco
once more. In the past two years they
have congregated rapidly, and to-day
there are more highbinders in Chinatown
than at any time in its history. They do
not tear tbe police, because the Chief bas
been sued by many Chinese for destroy
ing property in the past and annoyed by
litigation of various kinds until he is
afraid to take any aggressive measures
until the suits are won. Snits involving
large sums are still pending in the United
States courts, and it has required great
diplomacy to prevent further annoyance.
As Chief Crowley is not provided with a
large sum with which to combat such vex
atious litigation, he has decided not to
make a vigorous and aggressive fi^ht on
the murder societies untfl he gets some
standing in the courts. It is rumored in
Federal circles tbat Chief Crowley had
reason at one time to believe that the Chi
nese Consul would stand by him if he
made a fight to destroy tbe warring tongs,
but his experience has been bitter, for he
bas not received tbe aid be expected from
tbe Consul.
Sergeant Price believes there will be
serious trouble within a few days after
the funeral of "Little Pete." He says the
hisrhbmders talk openly and make no
secret of their intentions. Tbat tbey
want to kill a See Yup of high standing
there can be no question. The See Yups
outnumber the Sam Yups thirty to one,
and while they are generally poor, there
are some rich men of great influence
among them. A conspicuous target of
this character is commonly known as
"Big Jim," owner of several large restau
THE EXAMINER'S SPECIAL CONSUL-GENERAL.
People were smiling yesterday over the accuracy of the Examiner in publishing the
above picture as that of the present Consul-general in this City. That remarkable sheet
represented him as terrorized here and in abject fear of his life. As a matter ot fact, the
pictureis un old one of the ex-Ccnsul-General, who, according to Vice-Consul KingOwyang,
is now in Havana, Cuba. But with the grapevine telegraph at the Examiner's command,
a little misrepresentation of this kind only excites amusement and the comment, 'Any
fake goes with the Examiner."

rants and buildings. It is believed by
many that he will be killed before the
week is over to avenge the death of
"Little Pete," and "Big Jim" is graver
to-day than he baa been in years.
The siluation is something akin to a
reign of anarchy among the whites. Talk
with what the economists call the prole
tariat, the common masses of working
Chinese, about the deatn of "Little Pete"
and they will say : "Heap good to kill
him quick. Some Chinamen getting too
rich."
The See Yups are the names of tbe poor
and whatever troubles they may have with
tbe Sam Yups a bitter cluss hatred is at
the bottom of it and is tbe lasting cause
of the feud. Thus far the war in China
town is a part of the protest of masses
against classes, and it is world-wide in its
scopeâ living wherever the Chinese popu
late the earth.
It is highly improbable, according to the
ideas of several gentlemen who speak the
Chinese language and who have traveled
in China, that Li Hung Chang or the
Emperor Kwonjj Sui will ever interfere
with so petty an affair as a war among
Chinese thugs in San Francisco. One
reason is that the See Yups are all mem
bers of the Ngi Hing Wooi Society, one of
the most powerful political organizations
on earth. This Ngi Hing Wooi party was
organized to perpetuate tbe Mongolian
blood in power rather than the Tartar.
The See Yups would like to see Li Hung
Chang Emperor instead of Kwong Sui,
who is a Tartar. It is said tbat Li Hung
Chang is a secret friend of the powerful
Ngi Hing Wooi and that this society would
always be powerful enough to protect its
friends, the See Yups, from punishment
in China or elsewhere by orders of Li
Hung Chang or the Emperor himself.
THE CORONER'S INQUEST.
A Jury Impaneled Yesterday
Viewed the Remains.
Inclosed in a somber casket of costly
material, with rich silver mountings, the
remains of "Little Pete" were removed
from the undertaking parlors of N. Gray
& Co. yesterday morning to the Monrue.
A crowd of tbe morbidly curious gath
ered, but were not granted admittance.
Coroner Hawkins had impaneled the
following persons to act as a jury at the
inquest, and they were on hand to view
the body:
A. Grauwell, 1418 Powell street; L. Hur
ley, 617 Mission street; M. Vanrierbuitle,
1111 Buchanan street; F. Harman. 5 Treat
avenue; W. L. Murphy, New Western
Hotel; F. Frey, 1708 Larkin streer;
Thomas McCue, 110 Fourth street; J. C.
Brandelin, 1913 Mission street; E. C.
Jahn, 517 Howard street; Gus Rummell,
20 Bernard street; R. Jones. 946 Mission
street; F. Ransome, 334 Eddy street; L.
Delatonr, 136 Fifth street, and H. S. Dunn,
610 Montgomery street.
The date of the inquest has not been
set at this time, but it will probably be
held later in the week.
Later in the afternoon the body was re
moved to the dead man's home at 819^
Washington street. It now reposes
within thirty feet of the spot where the
flame of life was extinguished by the as
sassin's bullet.
"THE WIDOW'S GRIEF."
Highbinders Watch the Scene of
Mourning With Satisfaction.
After the remains had been viewed by
the jury that will act at the inquest the
body of Fang Chiiig, or "Little Pete," was
removed by the undertakers to his home
at 81934 Washington street. When the
ca-kf t was taken from the hearse a scene
pitiful :o witness took place.
The widow of the murdered man leaned
over the coffin with the tears streaming
from her eyes and gave way to her grief in
heart-breaking wailing and rn.oaning.3She
was fupported by two male relatives, who
were themselves weeping.
"Little Pete's" mother-in-law was as
uncontrollable as her daughter. Their
violent manifestation of grief did not
abate for some time.
The casket with its contents was ten
derly carried upstairs and laid on two
sable-covered supports. Candles were
lighted and placed at the foot of the
casket and the other ceremonies peculiar
to the Chinese religious customs per
formed. Two huge bouquets of violets
were placed on the casket by the widow.
Mourners, dressec in white, with a white
strip tied around the head, the ends being
left to hang down the back, grouped them
selves near the tapers on a mat.
The arrival of the body created great
excitement The police were kept bu-ied
in making the crowds move on. High
binders would station themselves in the
adjoining doorways and wa;ch every move
made with the eyes of a hawk.
"These fellows," said Officer Regan, as
he shouted to a gronp of Celestials, and
emphasized his remarks by pushing one
of them forcibly along, "want to see who
offer condolence to the relatives. When
it comes to a feud they will have such per
sons marked."
Though the police succeeded in keeping
the streets clear of highbinders, the win
dows opposite were infested with them in
force. Their almond eyes took in every
thing to the minutest detail. Many per
sons are even now marked for death be
cause they showed sympathy for the fam
ily of the dead.
CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE
Suspects Invent N^w Tales to Con
fuse the Police.
Chin Poy now has a new tale to account
for the whereabouts of himself and Wong
Sing during the hours immediately pre
ceding the murder of "Little Pete." He
says they left their room and went to din
ner at 5 P. M. They returned shortly be
fore 7 o'clock, and neither left the room
until arrested by the police.
Sergeant Mooney and Officer P. A. Gil
leii held a consultation with Wong Chung,
the barber in whose place of business Pete
was killed, and Wong Loons, a man being
shaved at the time of ttie casualty, in the
City Prison yesterday. Louie LocK acted
as interpreter. Judge Robert Ferral was
also present.
Tne result of the conference is withheld
by the police. They refuse for obvious
reasons to state at this time whether the
witnesses recognize the two men accused
as the murderers or not. They do state,
however, that no vital testimony was ad
duced. Of cours* this was expected by
the police.
CHIEF CROWLEY'S VIEWS.
Ho Attributes to Llttla Pete All
Recent Outbreaks in
Chinatown.
Chief Crow!ey, in speaking yesterday of
"Little Pete's" murder, blamed him for
all the trouble that has occurred in China
town since he first came into public no
tice.
"Little Pete," said the Chief, "was un
qnestionably the cleverest Chinaman on
the Pacific Coast, and probably in the
United States. He was a born organizer,
and was full ot schemes and deviltry.
"Until his advent there were no high
binder societies or tongs, and the Chinese
were quiet, orderly and peaceable. He
was the rirst to organize a tong, and
finally be had fifteen or sixteen oi them
at his command. They levied blackmail
upon house of ill fame and upon inoffen
sive merchants, and by that means Little
Pete became a rich man.
"Going back thirty years or so the Chi
nese were formed into organizations duly
incorporated according to the laws of the
State. Ah Ching, as noble and honorable
a man as ever lived, was the president of
one of the leading companies and when
there happened to be any dispute among
the Chinese ne was selected almost inva
riably as arbiter and his decisions were
never questioned.
"Then followed the organization of the
Six Companies, which was really brought
about by the poverty among the Chinese,
so that they could by consolidation more
easily help their less fortunate country
men.
"I remember when it was decided to
send forty women back to China. I was
consulted in the matter and procured a
house on Grove street for the women till
the steamer was ready to sail. The Six
Companies boucht tfieir tickets and every
thing was ready for their departure, when
some lawyers applied for a writ of habeas
corpus before Judge McKinstry and the
women remained. Little Pete's Hand was
in the business to prevent tbe women from
leaving.
"He was at the bottom of every black
mailing scheme and held absolute pow*r
over the highbinders in Chinatown. He
enriched himself at the expense of fallen
women and merchants who were afraid of
his power to sacrifice their lives.
"Four years ago, when Sergeant Price
and his squad demolished the headquar
ters of the different tongs, it was Little
Pete who instigated the damage suits
against me and the squad in the United
States District Court because, as he said,
it would deter me from any further at
tempts to repeat the dose. In that Little
Pete made a mistake, and ne came to rec
ognize that fact.
"Five years ago I prevailed upon the
Six Companies to employ eight responsi
ble Chinese to act as policemen, and each
of ths eight carried a tag signed dy me
showing their authority. By that means
I thought they would be able to keep the
Six Companies and myseJf posted as to
any proposed action of the highbinders to
commit murder. I have found out my
mistake, as they have been utterly useless,
aud I will ask the Six Companies to dis
continue employing them.
"It has always been the case that while
there was an extra force of police in
Chinatown there was no shooting, but as
soon as the extra force was withdrawn
trouble recommenced.
"It would take 140 men to properly pa
trol Chinatownâ that is, forty men on
three watches of eight hours each. The
taxpayers would never tolerate the ex
pense of Keeping such a force of men in
Chinatown. Besides, with my present
force the men would have to be taken from
their beats, and people living on these
beats would be unprotected. That would
never do.
"I have about twenty men in China
town now and will keep them there under
Sergeants Price and Cook till the present
trouble blows over. I can do no more
with the torce at my command."
"THE AMERICAN TERROR."
Sergeant Price Believes That More
Bloodshed Is Inevitable.
Sergeant Price is now in Chinatown
with a special detail of eight men. He is
relieved at regular intervals by Sergeant
Cook with anotner special detail of the
same number.
As is well known. Price is the man who
broke up the highbinder organizations
about four years ago, and inspired so much
dread in their murderous breasts that for
about three and a half years there was
hardly any trouble at .all in the Chinese
quarter. He is called by Chinese "The
American Terror." When such men as he
come to retard the present situation as a
crisis future murders need surprise no one.
"I regard the situation here as most
serious," he said yesterday, "but do not
look for any great trouble till after the
funeral.
"I understand that the Sara Yup men
have imported the most desperate rascals
belonging to the highbinder tongs to be
found in the interior and coast towns to
carry on the feud. One thing is certain.
ThÂ»re was a time when I knew every high
binder in Chinatown and where nearly
every individual one could be found, but

IN LOS ANGELES, TOO.
The Blood Fever Is Making Itself
Manifest In the Southern
City.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 25.â The
tragic death of Little Pete at the hands of
hi enemies has greatly intensified the an
tagonism between the contending factions
of Chinese boycotters in this city. In view
of these things the situation in Chinatown
is becoming more strained every moment,
and the report of tbs highbinder's pistol
is likely to be heard at any time. To-day
Saey Bin and Wong Bong, two of the Sam
Yup bad men, arrived Jrom San Francisco
to aid their friends in resisting the Sea
Yup boycott.
Tne murder of the Sam Yup chief in
San Francisco has aroused all the mem
bers of that, company to a state of fury,
and the killing will be avenged here if the
opportunity out presents itself. The con
tending tongs have been quietly arming
themselves all day, and tue situation is
assuming grave proportions. Chinamen
from the vegetable gardens and small
villaees about the city are docking to this
city in great numbers, and their manner
and conversation denote a state of intense
excitement and anxiety. The police have
been doubled in Chinatown :o- night, and
general preparations are under way to
prevent an outbreaK or quell a riot. Tbe
Chief declares he can cope wirh the
belligerents, but this is very much doubted
t>y many citizens in case a hght is once
begun.

THE HIGHBINDERS.
While the notorious "Little Pete" was
not a citizen of such character as to make
his murder a loss to the community, he
was, nevertheless, sufficiently prominent
and powerful to make it an important
event in the City and to call sharply to
the public mind the growing evil of per
mitting highbinders to ply their murder
ous trade along our streets.
Ever since the outbreak of the struggle
between the Bee Yupi and the Sam Yups
professed murderers have plied their trade
in the streets of Chinatown, and have re
peatedly slaughtered their victims under
circumstances which show not only a dis
regard for human life, but an utter con
tempt for American law. "Little Pete" is
only one of several victims who have
fallen in this struggle, and there is ample
reason for believing that his death will
be followed by many others unless drastic
measures are taken by the police to pre
vent them.
It has long ago been demonstrated tbat
it is impossible to govern the Chinese com
munity by laws which are sufficient for
Americans and Europeans. In the first
place, the Chinese, as a people, have no
abhorrence of murder, and make no effort
to hunt out the perpetrators of such of
fenses. In the second place, they have no
regard for the sanctity of an oath, and on
i he witness-stand commit such perjuries
tnat, whether they testify for or aeainst
the accused, they invariably leave in the
minds of the jury the suspicion which
raises the douot that, under our law,
must be construed in favor of the pris
oner.
To govern tlie population of Chinatown
there is needed something of the strict
and despotic law of China. The police
force in the limits of the Chinese district
should not only be increased in numbers,
but sl;ould be given increased power. The
police should have authority to arrest any
Chinaman whom they suspect of being a
highDinder and search him to see if he
carries concealed weapons. They should
not have to wait for the commission of a
crime or to have reason for suspecting a
man of committing it in order to be
authorized to arrest him and make the
search. They should have that authority
and be instructed to exercise it at all times
of the day or night.
In the performance of their duties in
Chinatown it is as easy for the police
officers to "spot" hitthbinders as it is for
them to spot well-known crooks among
gatherings of Americans. If they were
authorized to arrest any person suspected
of being a highbinder, to search him and
to take away from him any weapons
found on him, much might be done to
eradicate that murderous gang from the
City.
Certainly we have had an ample expe
rience of Chinatown to be well assured
that the ordinary processes of our law are
not equal to tbe task of holding in sub
jection the malignant nature of these
Mongolian murderers. The highbinders
constitute a profession that is public in
its nature. They have their meetings al
most openly and many of them are well
known to the police. They work for hire,
and advertisements offering rewards for
assassinations are posted in Chinatown as
publicly as advertisements for any legiti
mate business. It is certainly not beyond,
the power of American law and justice to
put a stop to such open offenses.
The British Government by takingdrastlc
measures exterminated the thugs in India,
aud while in doing bo it committed many
acts which shocked the sensibilities of the
civilized world, the measures nevertheless
proved efficacious and were justified by
the results attained. California could
well afford to imitate the British example
in this regard. While stringent measures
against highbinders might raise a cry in
the East of injustice to the mild-man
nered yellow man they would at least save
our City from the disgrace of tolerating
professional murderers and in the end
would justify themselves by the establish
ment of law and order and the preserva
tion of life.
The highbinders must be suppressed.
They constitute a menace not only to the
Chinese but to the white race. It is true
that at present they rarely or never under
take to kill a white man, bat if they are
permitted to grow bold in their infamous
trade there is no telling to what extent
their violence may go. "Little i'ete" has
not been a credit to the City while he
lived, but if his murder in a barber-shop
on a public thoroughfare, in an hour of
business activity, rouses the people to a
sense of the evil which confronts them
and determines them to take resolute ac
tion to suppress it, then "Little Pete" will
have become something of a public bene
factor and do enough by his death to
counteract the evil he did in his life.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
A carious situation has been produced
at Washington by the letter of Senor
Rodriguez declaring that the Greater Re
public of Central America will not con
sent to the construction of the Nicaragua
canal under the terms of the bill now be
fore the Senate. The letter virtually kills
the bill, but the advocates of the measure
are resolved that it shall not die until
they have thoroughly investigated the
source from which the letter comes, and
made clear the motive as well as the
mea.iing of it.
Senator Morgan, who has given the sub
ject careful consideration, declares that
the bill was drawn bo as to come within
the terras of the concession granted by
Nicaragua. He asserts there is nothing in
it which justifies the Government of that
country in withdrawing the concession,
and insists on keeping the bill before the
Senate until all the Nicaragua corre
spondence with our State Department can
be laid before the Senators for consider
ation.
Of course the efforts of Senator Morgan
will not help the bill directly. Since the
Government of the Greater Republic,
which now acts for Nicaragua, has de
clared its opposition to the measure the
matter becomes one of diplomacy, and
must be dealt with by the State Depart
ment rather than by Congress. The Sen
ate, neverthless, has an equal voice with
the President in managing foreign affairs,
and by bringing before it all the corre
spondence of the State Oflice on the sub
ject may discover some means by which
to overcome the objections interposed and
make clear to the Government of the
Greater Republic that it would do well to
withdraw the opposition and make way
for the construction of the work.
The importance of a canal across the
isthmus is bo great that the United States
cannot permit either the folly or the pride
of the people of those countries to prevent
its eventual construction. Sooner or later
there must be such a canal and when com
pleted it must be under the vinual con
trol of the United States. We need the
use of it for commerce and we would need
the command of it in time of war. It
must therefore be an American canal, and
since the United States is the only power
in America capable either of building it,
maintaining it or defending it, it must be
under our control.
The action taken by the Government of
the Greater Republic will have Us effect
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1897.
In determining the action of tbe Senate on
tn<3 proposed aroitration treaty with Great
Britain. The canal is one of the subjects
which we will not be willing to submit to
the arbitration of any European power.
Thus the complication which has been
developed over the canal bill will affect
the principle of arbitration, which
but a short time ago was regarded so
favorably throughout the country.
The people will uphold Senator Morgan
in his right, even though, it appears to be
a forlorn one. The issue is not one which
we can trust to the hidden processes of
diplomacy. It should be discussed in the
open Senate, and if the Greater Republic
of Central America is to prevont the con
struction of the work, which will be of
benefit to its country, simply because it
will be controlled by the United States,
the people ought to know the reason why.
THE CONTROLLER'S REPORT.
The report of the State Controller for the
two fiscal years ending June 30, 1896. forms
a compact volume of statistics of 198 pages
and will be found dry, tedious and heavy
to those who by their duties are required
to read, mark and inwardly digest it. The
work nevertheless deserves to be studied,
for as it deal's with the finances of the
State the recommendations contained in
it are of concern to every taxpayer.
The Controller calls attention to the In
crease in offices and commissions during
the two fiscal years included in his report,
and says tbat while ia the last two State
campaigns "everybody preached economy
but few if anybciy practiced it." He goes
on to show that during the sessions of
1891,1893 and 1595 the number of offices
and commissions were largely increased,
and says: "The monthly salaries paid in
this office alone on the last day of each
month have increased in round numbers
from $36,890 in January, 1891, to $44,700 in
November, ]896, an annual increase of
nearly $95,000. These figures do not in
clude the payrolls of any of the State in
stitutions, nor do they convey an idea of
tbe additional expense to the State, for
the salaries paid these newly created offi
cers and commissions is the smallest part
of the appropriations made for their ben
efit."
During the period of this increase two
commissions have been abolished â the
Forestry Commission and tbe State Board
of Viticultureâ whose work has been
turned over to the State University and is
now conducted at a comparatively small
expense. The fact that there has been an
increase in the salaries and appropriations
for State officers and commissions despite
the attempt at economy by abolishing the
two named will be surprising to the tax
payers. "Certainly," as the Controller
says, "this does not look like economy,
nor even an approach to it."
The poor policy which prevents the
maKnificent water power owned by the
State at Folsom prison from being util
ized in some manner to the pecuniary
benefit of the taxpayers is pointed out and
the Controller recommends that if it can
hot be used for tbe purpose of manufac
turing articles of wearing apparel
used in various State institutions
because of competing with free labor
it could be well employed in the gen
sration of electrical power which could
be transmitted to Sacramento and used in
the Capitol, State Printing Office and agri
cultural pavilion. It is calculated the
amount saved by this alone would pay a
large return on the investment.
The one cheering feature of the report
is to be found in the statement that the
total general fund estimate for the next
two fiscal years is $6,027,164 16, a reduc
tion of about $1,050,000 from the estimate
of two years ago. This reduction is
caused by the elimination of items for the
support of aged indigent?, district agri
cultural societies, boards of horticulture
and viticulture, debris commissioner,
commissioner of public worKs, schoolbook
department of the State Printing Office,
and the Supreme Court commission. It
is pleasing to know that something was
,ione in the past in the direction of econ
omy, and the present Legislature we trust
will profit by the report to devise means
for greater economy in the future.
. TRUE ART APPRECIATED.
California offers substantial encourage
ment to artists of merit. This is shown
by the fact that those who devote their
best efforts and talents to painting, sculp
ture or other branches of the plastic arts
are rewarded by returns which if not al
together commensurate with their own
ideas of their deserts are at least equal
to the emoluments gained by persons of
equal ability in the more prosaic walks of
life.
A gentleman connected with a promi
nent school of ait and design nas made
extensive investigations touching this
subject, and ha 3 ascertained that any
properly educated artist who studies and
works, and who, in short, does his duty
by his profession, is able to maintain a
respectable position in society and his
financial returns are on the average as
great as they would have been had he ap
plied himself with like diligence to any
other profession.
Of course it is all at variance with the
accepted canons of what used to be known
as Bohemia for disciples of the gentle arts
to manifest an inclination for industry and
providence, jet it is noted that the bril
liancy and genius of those thus endowed
is by no means clouded, but that on the
other hand they shine all the more re
splendently because they are able to meet
the proper and reasonable requirements of
their station in society by tne exercise of
ordinary circumspection in the usual af
fairs of lite.
While California does not put forward
her artists as the most thrifty and frugal
class of citiiens, yet it is with no small
degree of satisfaction that this develop
ment of the new and true spirit of the
realm of Bohemia should be encountered
heie in sunny California, where the sway
of easy and generous living has been
almost universal.
An additional subject for congratula
tion, though it may to a certain extent
detract from our self-glorification in re
gard to the extent to which artists are
patronized in our own State, is that there
is beyond our borders an increasing de
mand for the creations of Californian art
ists. This fact is attested by the orders
for paintings received almost constantly
from New York and other Eastern cities.
McCULLAGHS LOVE ROMANCE
I'ittsbnrg Dispatch.
Henry Watterson, who for thirty years was
a close friend of J. B. McCullagh, confirms the
impression that there was a love romance in
the dead editor'B early career in St. Louis.
The young woman in the case lived in Louis
ville for a while. She was a handsome and
accomplished girl, and was the adopted
daughter of a present St. Louis official, who
was Mayor of St. Louis in the early '70's, and
almost a millionaire then. Her foster parents
lived in the most aristocratic section of St.
Louis, and broke off the match because McCul
lagh was poor. "Why, he is only a reporter,"
was the crushing reply, when she pleaded for
permission. About twelve years ago she mar
ried a rich doctor, and they moved to San
Francisco. He cruelly abused her from the
8 tart, and in a few years she got a divorce and
soon after died oi a broken heart. The recol
lection of the affair saddened McCullagh's
later yearn, and helped to make him the cynic
he was.

ILXAS ANGEL.
Washington Post.
Chief among the Populist candidates for the
Senatorship in Idaho whom Senator Dubois
has to fear is one bearing the euphonious
name of Texas Angel. This is not a nickname
and Mr. Angel is considered quite a big gun
out in the Gem of the Mountains State. He
was a gallant soldier in the Union army and
led a company in a desperate charge at the
battle of Games' Mill. An old friend ot his
tells a story of this charge which would indi
cate that there is some connection between
profanity and good fighting. This particular
charge was so desperate that 175 men were
killed out of a column of 400. The men
wavered in the face of the storm of lead that
met them. Angel sprang iorward swinging
his sword and shouted 10 them in language
more forcible than elegant to "line up." They
did line uo and carried the position that was
the objective poiiu of the charge. Some of
the men explained afterward that when they
heard their captain, who had the reputation
of being a very pious man, talk like that they
were more afraid of him than they were of the
enemy in front of them.
AMÂ£RICANiTiS.
A New Name for the Disease Commonly
Known as Hustle.
Minneapolis Tunes.
A German physician has discovered a new
disease. He calls it Amencanitis. Upon
comiDg to this country he was puzzled by find
ing among his patients all manner of nervouJ
disorders which seemed to have no organ ft!
cause. He has made a study of the different
varieties that come under his notice, and has
named the mysterious malady Americanitis.
In his opinion, the trouble arises in the hurry,
excitement and intense application of Hie in
this country.
It Is true that as & nation, Americans lack
repose. Yankee zeal in well-doing is an un
deniable facr of history. It is proverbial
among foreign chroniclers who have written
us up and especially down.
Threa-fourths of the population is afflicted
with nervousness, which varies in intensity
from trivial habits and mannerisms to actual
disease. We drum with our finders. We pull
flowers to bits. We twist and untwist scraps
of paper. We tap the floor with our feet. VN c
gesture wildly, and sway back and forth In
rocking chairs. Finally, we, collectively and
individually, chew gum. All this occurs in
ordinary conversation and passes for vivacity.
It is regarded as not only perfectly innocent
and natural, but as a necessary form of work
iDg off superfluous energy.
As a matter of fact, it is a most unreasonable
mode of expression and an unjustifiable waste
of vital energy. It is a serious indication of a
wrong altitude of mind and an unwholsome
mode of Hie.
It is not work, but lack of reDose, that Is the
cause of the nervous prostration and breaking
down characteristic of modern society. We
live too intensely. We throw our whole being
into every trivial act. We talk with our hands
and our eyes and our shoulders as well as our
voice. We push with our feet on the carriage
floor as though to hurry the too slowly moving
wheels. We listen with tense muscles to an
animated speaker and wonder at the close of
the day why we are ex&austhd in body and
mind.
Nature never intended that the whole body
should work all the time. In accordance with
the universal principle of rhythm she de
signed the different members to alternately
work and rest, sparing each other. When we
disobey this law of repose there is a constant
friction that must in time wear out the ma
chine. The result is chronic fatigue, not from
overwork, but from unnecessary work. When
we learn to use only those muscles which are
needed for a particular act we will expend but
a small fraction of the vital energy we now
lavish on our work, and we will have a reserve
force that will save us from premature break
down and tide us over disease.
Students of physical culture are making a
study of the laws of repose. Tney may one
day evolve a science of rest which will prove
the cure for that degeneracy which we mourn
in modern society.
THE SEAT OF EMPIRE.
Washington Post.
The steady decline of the relative greatness
and power of the East is very Impressively
shown by each succeeding decennial census
and the reapportionment thereunder of seats
in the National House of Representatives.
One has no occasion to look at the big picture
hung over the west staircase of the hall in
which that House assembles in order to realize
how surely and how fast the star of the empire
takes Its way westward.
A PECULIAR PEOPLE.
Chicago News.
Above or below this whirling earth there is
not a more interesting subject for study than
the American people. They are blessed with
more different kinds of contradictory natures,
they are more consistently inconsistent, they
are more harmoniously unharmonious than
any other people that ever drew the breath of
life. ___^________

Freemasonryâ A. T. D., Los Angeles, Cal.
There is no certainty as to the date of the ori
gin ot Freemasonry. The difficulty of arriving
at the precise time, place or circumstance in
which Masonary or its true prototype began
has been encountered by every writer on the
subject. It is claimed that recent explora
tions in Egypt accord with the tradition that
the order was in existence when the pyramids
were built. Modern Freemasonry began in
London June 24, 1717, "high noon of the year,
the day of light and of roses," when the four
London lodges, having created themselves
into a grand lodge, named tneir first grand
master. In England there is a claim that the
order was established in York in the year 926.
This is a subject that ennnot be answered in
the space allotted to this department. It is an
interesting one, and the writings of Anderson
and of Preston, which go deep into the origin
of the order, will give you a great deal of in
formation.

If the augnrie9 are not falsified the pres

JOHN McLAREN, Who Has Acted as Superintendent of Golden
Gate Park for the Past Ten Years.
eat McLaren recalled some of the things
that have been accomplished during his
tenure of office, as also a few other projects
which are seriously contemplated by the
Park Commissioners.
"The construction of Stow Lake and the
waterfall," he said, "was certainly one of
the most extensive and noteworthy addi
tions to the attractions of the park during
the last ten years. It fulfills a twofold ob
ject. An elevation of 300 feet above the
tide level helps to maintain the parity of
the water, which is both attractive to the
eye and useful for irrigation purposes.
"The reclamation and cultivation of the
sand dunes have involved an enormous
amount of labor. Sea bent grass must first
of all be planted ana allowed to remain
for two years, at the end of which the
sand is usually tied down pretty firmly
and available for the growth of primroses,
California poppies aud the lupin shrub.
No less than 350,000 trees were planted
west of Strawberry Hill during one of our
heaviest years.
Â£"Many miles of roaos and walks have
been constructed and about 300 acres of
lawns and open glades have been added in
recent years. The object of the Commis
sioners is to reproduce as faithfully as pos
sible the more pleasing atpects of nn tram
meled nature as represented both by wood
and water. With respect to the last
named feature we can extend the surface
of such improvements in a westerly di
rection at a comparatively small cost, ow
ing to the numerous springs which are to
be found near the surface of the soil.
There is a good deal of sand, bat when
this is removed the water level can be
reached without much difficulty.
The eucalyptus, pine aud cypress form
the best preliminary growth I know, for
the reason that they can stand our ever
lasting winds better than any other
shrubs and form a protecting shelter for
plants not as robust in character.
"The three-mile drive along the beach
was finished last year and the three
bridges already constructed together with
the fourth now in course of construction,
represent a large outlay of time and ex
pense. The new bridge, when completed
will be 160 feet long by 132 wide and will
provide an ample drive for horses, a foot
path and a bicycle rath.
"The children's shelter and ladies'cot
tage were built last year, and Mr.
Sweeney's generous donation of the Straw
berry Hill kiosk is among the most at
tractive of recent additions.
"We expect to add twenty acres to the
lawn surface this year, and we are intro
ducing new species of seeds right along.
Tne Commissioners seek to make our col
lection of California trees, plants and
flowers, as also suitable specimens from
Washington, Oregon and Arizona, as per
fect as possible. The Orient and Europe
have likewise furnished many flourishing
varieties.
"There is no other park in the United
States that can boast of so comprehensive
a collection. Hundreds of delicate species
which can be raised without difficulty
here would perish in a night in the Eatt.
"The area of sixty acres formerly occu
pied by the Midwinter Fair is being rap-
Idly restored to its original condition.
Water-pipes have been laid down in
twenty-five acraa, the surface of the soil
has Deen covered with a foot of loam, and
the whole area has been refunded.
"It is hardly necessary to enumerate
such improvements as the museum iron
annex ana the park lodge itself. The
latter is, perhaps, not the largest, but cer
tainly one of the handsomest and most
suitable buildings of the kind in America.
Donations to the museum continue iti
generous abundance, Mr. Daggett's recent

Mr. McLaren intimated that there is a
probability of the park being illuminated
with eiectncity at an early date, more
particularly along the various drives
The cultivation of orchids is an impor
tant part of the superintendent's duties.
The Yandas and Cattleyas are doing
very well and other varieties from Central
America and the East Indies seem to
thrive. The zoological collection will from
time to time receive additions in the shape
of those animals and birds which may be
allowed to enjoy a certain measure ofi
freedom. The present park staff com-i

MORE PUNCTURES
IK LEES' THEORY
In Pegging Up Some Holes
the Detective Opens
Others.
Cconey's Lawyers Introduce " To
Me" Nctary Blanks Used
Four Years Ago.
Wade Qualifies a Sweeping Statement
Only to Contradict a Former
Witness.
It was Captain Lees' uneasy day. The
chief of detectives found, when the
Cooney case was resumed yesterday morn
ing, that there were squalls in all quarters.
His clients, the Fair children, had become
entangled in a nasty little lamily snarl
over the expediency of proceeding with
the case just at present. Moreover, the
discovery by the Craven people on Satur
day last of a batch of "to me" notarial
certificates in Attorney John H. Dickin
son's office that had been printed Drior to
1890 had punctured one of the tires of the
prosecution, so to speak, and Captain
Lees and things generally were not run
ning harmoniously together.
There was a corresponding elevation of
spirits among Cooney's adherents. His
attorneys impaled the prosecution by forc
ing Simon H. Wade to qualify his state
ment previously made that none of these
"to me" blanks had been turned out by
Crocker previous to August, 1895. Wade
saved himself and his firm from a har
pooning on sharp facts by declaring that
his memory along these lines did not ex
tend further back than 1895. But he fell '
afoul of a former witness on the same side |
when he told that the key words in legal
blank, "State of California," were printed/
from electrotypes instead of from type di
rect, and that these electrotypes bad been
in use in his house for many years.
There is a detective "o" in the word
"of" of this phrase in the Cooney blank,
and W. E. Stanford, the manager of the
legal blank department, had identified
the pencil deed certificate by this very de
fec'ive letter. Wade's testimony was
that electrotypes of the three words had
been in use at least fifteen years.
The case occupied the entire day. It
was a rehearsal of the technical routine of
a big printing-house, and to the uninitia
ted was a hashing of dry and uninter
esting details. Reudy thrashed his straw
over and over again. He had Foreman
Wade go over the detail of his work, and
the progress of a job in printing under h.s
supervision. There were tine points to be
brought out, as line almost as the invisi
ble defects in printing in these Cooney
certificates, and Reddy weighed and sifted
them with the greatest care. Battered
type was his principal theme. He put
into the hands of Wade specimens of va
rious notarial blanks printed by Crocker,
and haa the foreman enumerate the de
fects with the aid of magnifying glasses.
Where Reddy was going in his devious
digging and probing none but himselt
and Cooney knew.
After leading Wade through a catechism
on defective printing he suddenly intro
duced two deeds, both containing ac
knowledgments, with the words "to me"
in their contents. One of them, executed
by Notary Felix .Marcuse of Alameda,
j bore date May 29, 1893. The notarial ac
knowledgment of Marcuse corresponds in
form, size and printing defects in every
respect with the blanks used by Cooney,
with the single- exception that the ruling
on the margin is slightly more distant
from the border of printed matter.
The second rteed was acknowledged in
Stanislaus on July 18, 1893. The printed
matter in the notarial lorm is distended
ao as to include one more line than is con
tained in the Cooney documents. The
words "io me" occur in the proper place.
Both of these acknowledgments bear the
trademark of H. S. Crock- r & Co., printed
on the margin, and they ore self-evident
contradictions of the famous ''mathemat
ical demonstration" the Fair children de
clared they would bring forward to prove
that these words were not printed in no
tarial biants prior to August 18, 1895.
Lees examined these documents curi
ously. Ho turned his magnifying glass
on the Marcuse document repeatedly, and
made a detailed inspection of ttie defects
in the printing. Then it was hung up in
j evidence, and Reddy let his witness go
CAPTAIN FRANK E. WEBB.
Captain Prank E. Webb, who is a clerk in the law offices of John H. Dickinson,
will be the chief witness in Cooney's defense. It was â Dickinson who, as attorney
for tne printing-house of H. S. Crocker & Co., passed upon the legal wording and
torm of all legal blanks. There is now in Webb's possession; obtained from the
records of Dickinson's office, copies of blanks printed by 'Crocker & Co. as early as : â¢
1889â certificates of acknowledgment similar in wording and containing the same
defects in printing as those used, by Cooney on the pencil deeds of Mrs. ( Craven. f
The date of the printing of these blanks cau be established by reference to the tiles ;
of Dickinson' 3 office.
THE SAN FISAfTOISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1897.
FOREMAN SIMCN H. WADE as an Expert in Detecting Defects in the Printing of Legal Blanks.
to his seat after Bix hours' tedious ques
tioning.
Wade took n is place for cross-examina
tion the moment the case was called.
Cooney's attorneys presented him in turn
with the various "exhibits," as the copy
and proofs of notarial blank? printed by
Crocker since 1894 are legally termed, after
which the printing foreman was asked to
relate how he kept house.
"You have been superintendent of H. S.
Crocker's printing department for twenty
five years?"
"Yes, sir."
"And copy coming from the store goes
direct to you?"
"The person in charge of the blank de
partment 9ends his copy direct to the man
setting up the type. He, in turn, records
the copy in a book, sets it up, prints it,
and the"bla:ik i* filed away."
"What becomes of the proof?"
"It is sent to the proofreader for correc
tion and returned to the compositor who
locks tfce forms."
"Does the compositor put the forms in
the chase?"
"He sees that another man puts them
there. This man, in turn, delivers the
job to the pressman. As soon as the job
is completed it is delivered to the packing
table. The type, in turn, finds its way
back to the man who locked up the form
and l? returned to the case."
Continuing, Wade described the duties
of a proofreader and paper-cutter.
"How is proof taken in your otlice?'
"Sometimes through a press, sometimes
by means of a bammer or mallet and a
pianpr."
"Sometimes mistakes escape the notice
of the proofread .-r?"
"Very rarely."
"You do not look after each piece of
work individually?"
"Well, no; not exactly. I keep good
men to see that the work is done."
The examination drifted In detail to the
methods by which the house kept a record
of the number of notarial certificates, or
"blank No. 32." printed. It was cus
tomary /or tha compositor to enter the
number of blanks printed, the kind of
press used, and other minor details, in his
tiiriebook.
"What is the manner of printing forms
in your office?'
"Generally from the type, although
sometimes we use an electrotype or stereo
type."
"In case of blank 132, did you ever use a
stereotype or plate?"
"Yes, I think we made a plate of this
form in 1894 "
"Did you ever use this plate?"
"Yes, in 1894. In 1895 the form was
destroyed, because it became necessary to
insert two words in the blank."
These were the famous words "to me,"
Wade informed Reddy. Ha thought only
one set of blanks had been run "off from
the stereotype that did not contain these
words.
"Did yon ever print blanks with these
words in previous to 1894?"
â 'I suppose we did."
"Didn't you say here the other day that
in August, 1895, was the first time Crocker
& Co. had printed tliese words?"
"I said that as far as I knew this was
the case," was the testy answer. "My
records on this subject do not go back of
1894. I suppose that the house printed a
good many of tliese 'to me' forms before
that, as ihe lnw required the use of the
words. I want to set the newspapers
right as farns I am concerned."
Wade then told how lie had first come
to take an interest in the case. Manager
Crocker came to him about two month.s
ago and requested him to furnish copy
and proof of all the notarial blanks printed
by the house !cr the past few years.
"Did you know what was tho object of
your search? '
"Oh, yes; to produce evidence, I be
lieve."
"Against Mr. Cooney?'
"No. I think I did not know Mr.
Cooney then, but I supDOse it was to pro-
Stafe of California,
TWO STORIES OF DEFECTIVE LETTERS.
This is a reproduction of the key "State of California" in the pencil
deed's acknowledgment: According to Foreman Wade. Crocker & Co. have been
using electrotypes for this phrase for fifteen years in all their legal forms. It will
be noticed that the letter "o".in "of" lacks a small section to complete its perfect
contour, while. a "twist" flourish is missing from the lower end of the letter "f."
It was on account of these defects that W. E. Stanford was confident on Wednes
day last the Cooney blanks had not been printed previous to 1895. If the words
are an impression from a sterotype the defects must be in the plate and have been
printed as long as the plate has been in use.
duoe evidence in the Fair case generally."
"Did you have any conversation with
anybody else besides Mr. Crocker?"
"Yes; 1 believe Captain Lees came Into
the stationery department one day and
mr.de inquiries concerning 'blank No. 132,'
which he held in his hand. A few days
later a younc man, un assistant to De
tective Stilwell, called to inquire about
the blank. I said: 'Oh, I have seen that
blank before and I nave nothing to say
about it' A day later I asked Mr. Crocker
what I should do if people continued to
ask me questions ou this subject and he
said 'Refer them to me, 1 and when Stil
well himself called I sent him to Mr.
Crocker." . ' ,
'Was your attention called to any par
ticular form of type?" - - ' â - .
"Captain Lee?, when he called, showed
me Â« photographic copyâ" ;
"Yes, did he call your attention to any
thing in particular in this copy?"
"Not then; but later I wa* called to
the back office and Captain Lees asked
me certain questions relative to the man
ner in . winch the type was set ' up and
locked in the press." â¢ -
"Do you know if the words 'to me' were
printed previous to 1891?"
"I have no positive knowledge, but I
believe they were always printed in the
forms previous to the time the stereotype
was used in 1894." . ' .
"Were stereotypes used previous to that
'â¢1 don't think so, but they may have
been." .. '..
"Do yon know if there was any change
in blank 132 in 1891?" v
"I don't know anything about it. My
records, as I said before, only go Dack to
1894."
"Did yon ever see a blank printed by
Crocker & Co. before 1894 containing the
words 'to me' ?" ; \ , ,'â â â â 
"Not to my knowledge or recollection ?
Attorney Reddy: then presented Wade
with a notarial blank printed in 1880 con
taining the words "to me." Wade identi
fied it as the work of Crocker & Co.
"You will observe that this blank is
marked '124 N. That was the number
adopted before '132 N, 1 was it not? "
' "I presume so." .^ - .
â a Reddy then produced a second notarial
blank with tne words "to me." , It con
tained in the date line the figures "189â,"

evidently intended for use in the "nine

found tbirty-one in * this form, fifty-three
iin that of "August* 8, 1895. The introaac

"Could not these defects occur through
poor paper?" ://:,â  .-: '
"Yes," that is possible. There are a him
dred ways in which the defects might oc
cur. For instance, something might come
in contact. with the lace of the type."
The form of March 16, 1894, Wade said,
was stereotyped for the first time to his
knowledge in the history of the legal
blank work in the house. The stereotype
was destroyed in August, 1895, because it
was necessary to insert the words "to me"
in the old form of the blank. He thousrht
the plate had been used but once. The
key words, "State of California," at the
too of the blank had been electrotyped
many years ago for convenience sake.
There were a number of these electro
types in the printing department and it
was his opinion that they were used in
every form of blank..
George W. yon Ahn, a compositor in
Crocker's printing department, was called
to testify that he had set up various
forma of 'notarial blanks. District Attor
ney Hosmer had him identify the proofs
of the two forms in the 10,000 order of
January 8, 1896. Prior to the issue of Au
gust, 1895. Yon Ann said the blanks were
printed irom a stereotype. On that date
the stereotype was destroyed because the
new form required the insertion of the
words "to me."
"How long had you been using the
stereotype?" asked Attorney Reddy.
"Not very long. 1 '
"When did you first use it?"
"I think it was in 1895."
The case will be resumed to-morrow
morning.

ing for a Valley Kesort.
General Manager Henry C. Whiting of
the San Francisco and North Pacific Rail
road denies tue latest report from So
noma ihat the company will soon begin
to construct a sidetrack from Vineyard
station to the beautiful grounds of Buena
Vista. Mr. Whiting said yesterday:
"We hÂ»ve not got that far with the mat
ter yet, and at present the company has
no such intentions. After we looked at
the Vallejo place it occurred to us to look
at Buena Vista. The grounds would be
very expensive to keep up ana it would
cost* about $5000 to run a spur track to the
place. Buena Vif'a would make a superb
summer resort. We should be very glad
to land passengers there if somebody
would take hold of the place and make
another Del Monte of it. In fact it is a
Del Monte now. The grounds have foun
tains and flowers and are very handsome.
"We have been looking for a new picnic
resort for some time, and we will have
decided on the place in a few weeks, or
the whole matter will have been dropped
by that time."
The chateau at Buena Vista stands on a
mound and can be seen up and down the
valley for fifteen miles.

Annoyance.
If Arrested and Convicted a Long
Term of Imprisonment Will Be
Imposed Upon Him-
The Fire Department has been put to
considerable expense and annoyance for
the past two or three months by turning
out to false alarms.
Saturday night a false alarm was turned
in from box 147. Howard and Twentieth
streets, which was followed about half an
hour later by a false alarm from "box 97,
Polk and McAllister streets. Sunday
night a false alarm was turned in from box
34, Mission and Steuart streets, and yes
terday morning there was another false
alarm from box 87, Hayes and Steiner
streets.
Every effort had been made by members
of the department to find the man who
was turning in these false alarms, but
without success. Chief Sullivan became
exasperated and yesterday morninsc ad
dressed a letter to Chief of Police Crow
ley, asking the co-operation of the Police
D epartment in finding the man and put
ting a stop to the persistent annoyance
and continued expense.
The Chief at once notified the captains
of the different divisions to see that every
officer was instructed to keep a sharp
lookout for the man and to arrest him at
all hazards if discovered in the act cf turn
ing in an alarm.
AH the other members of the Police De
partment were similarly instructed, and
the citizens are asked to assist the police
and firemen in their efforts to arrest the
man.
Within the past two months there has
been on an average one false alarm per
day. Sometimes there would be three on
one night, and then there would be a ces
sation for a night or two, when two or
three more would follow.
Calculating thu time between the alarms
has led to the conclusion that the man
rides on a bicycle, and it is said that on
more than one occasion a bicycle-rider
was seen hurrying away from the direc
tion of the fire-alarm box a few seconds
beiore the fire-whistles sounded. He has
evidently some swift means of locomotion,
and it is* believed to be the bicycle.
The man la supposed to be a discharged

QUARRELS OF TWO
VENERABLE LOVERS
Thomas M. Quackenbush
Objects to Paying $500
a Month.
Nancy Ann, His Wife by Con
tract, Demands That Amount
of Him.
He Fears That She Will Attempt to
Ob a.n Half of His Estate After
His Death.
Mrs. Nancy Ann Abbott-Quackenbush
bad an interesting time in Judge Seaweil's
court yesterday, when her suit against
Thomas M. Quackenbush for $300 a month
alimony or nermanent support was called
for trial. Mr. Quackenbush's suit against
her to have canceled a certain marriage
contract and other papers which she holds
was taken up simultaneously, as the prop-
MRS. QUACKENBUSH OR MRS. ABBOTT.
erty rights are identical in both actions.
She say* he is worth $600,000, while he
declares that his property will not total
more than $300,000.
Mrs. Quackenbush is elderly but well
preserved, with the manners of a lady of
cultnre, gentle voiced and clear of intel
lect. Her appearance on the witness-stand
indicated that she knew what she was |
about, and none of the attorneys was able j
to shake her from any position that she
onoe took in regard to the relations be
tween her and Mr. Quackenbush before
and after their marriage by contract
In reply to Attorney Arthur Roagers the
lady told a simple tale of her marriage by I
contract. She said that she met Mr.
Quackenbush first when she went to him
for the purpose of seeing about some re
pairs to a bouse in whic:i she was living.
Alter that their acquaintance ripened into
friendship, and be often called to see her.
He manifested his affection for her and
asked her to marry him. He rented a
room in her house and a few days after
ward they were married by contract, the
document being in these words:
San Francisco, Nov. 15, 1889.
Know all men that I, Thomas M. Quacken
bush of the City of San Francisco, State of
Calllornia, and Nancy Ann Abbott of Sao Fran
cisco, State of California, do agree to live to
gether as man and wiie, share and share alike,
60 long as we both shall live.
Thomas M. Qtjackenbvsh,
Nancy Ann Abbott.
To indicate that she was recognized as
the wife of Mr. Quackenbusb, she pro
duced the following order for the delivery
of some valuable diamonds:
December 22, 1892.
Mr. Gunter Fredericks: Please deliver the dia
monds left in your care to the bearer, my
wife. Thomas M. Quackenbcsh.
It was agreed, Mrs. Quackenbush testi
fied, that there should be no public an
nouncement of the marriage, but consider
able comment having been made in reeard
to her relations with M r. Quackenbush, she
talked with Attorneys Roagers and Heller,
and received a form of acknowlegment of
marriage, which she wrote out, and Mr.
Quackenbush signed it on Christmas day.
It reads:
December 25, 1892.
Mrs. Nancy A. Abbott Having become my
wife on November 15, 1889, upon my agree
ment that she should receive a wife's snare of
my estate at my deatb, 1 now confirm that
agreement and charge my property with it,
and change my will to give her this full share
as if I had made no will, and she can make
public our marriage.
Thos. M. Qcackenbush.
This brief document was made the sub
ject of considerable discussion later in the
day, as Attorney W. W. Foote showed
thai MrÂ«. Quackenbunh testified originally
that Mr. Quackenbush suggested the
words in the statement, and he believed
that her subsequent correction was made
at the suggestion of others, who knew
that it might be important to have the ex
act truth brought out.
Another paper was also offered in evi
dence, showing further acknowledgment
of the marriage:
San Francisco, January 4, 1893.
I do hereby declare that Mrs. Nancy A. Ab
bott and mysell were married on November
15, 1889, and we have since lived together as
husband and wife, and 1 hereby so change my
-will as to give her a one-half interest in my
estate at my death.
Thomas M. Qdackenbcsh.
Wituess: A. H. Abbott.
Delia M. Hurmans.
Mrs. Quackenbush said she had asked
her husband to sign that document be
cause he had promised her and her son
that he would do so. He signed it just as
he was about to go away to the springs for
the benefit of his healtu.
When Attorney Foote began bis cross
examination it was evident that there was
no good feeling between them, as they
met before at the taking of the lady's pre
liminary deposition, and tde verbal con
test begun at that time was continued in
court. After leading the witness quietly
over the main points of the case Mr.
Foote took up the marriage contract of
:NoYember 15, 1889, and a spirited colloquy
took place.
Mr. Footeâ Now, this so-called marriage con
tract. Was it for love 1
Mrs. QuackcnbUÃhâ Yes, I loved him; I cer
tainly loved him.
Mti I.uk you your age, madam *
My asre?
Yes, your age; that is, if you don't object.
I don't.
Well, what is It, please?
I WBF 55 last Christmas day.
And Mr. Quackenbush, you said, is rising 76?
Yes.
And you still say that the marriage was for
love ?
I loved him a great deal.
Were you enamored of his person and the
qualities of his mind?
I thought a great deal of him.
Are you sure that mercenary motive! had
nothing to do with the matter?
I had no such idea.
Mr. Foote was evidently inquisitive in
regard to the preliminaries of the engage
ment and the signing of the contract, and
Mrs. Qutfcken bush was shy about telling.
The dialogue was quite entertaining.
Mr. Footeâ l want you to answer me now.
Was there no love-making?
The witnessâ Tnat is a question that I re
fused to answer on the taking of my deposi
tion.
â¢â¢I remember that, and I remember that
your lawyer Instructed you to refuse to an
swer. Now I ask the court to direct you to
answer." .
The witness appealed to the court and
Judge Seawell said as gently as possible
that it was necessary for the witness to
disclose all th 6 circumstances attending
the ceremony.
Mr. Foote (returning to the attack)â Now
whs there any love-making before the signing
of this first contract?
The witness (reluctantly)â Yes.
"Any hugging?"
"Yes."
"Auy kissing?"
â¢â¢Yes."
"Then, you signed the contract?"
"Yes."
"Who drew up the contract?"
"I did."
"Still it was only for affection that you
signed the contract?"
â¢Yes."
â¢ 'Then what did you mean when you put in
the words 'share and shard alike' In the con*
tract?"
â  It meant that if he had plenty I was to
share it with him, and if he was poor 1 was to
share his poverty. Of course, I expected my
husbaud to support me.
When erguing as to the admissibility of
Mrs. Quackeu bush's deposition as evi
dence in the present hearing Mr. Foote
said:
I believe this woman was in a scheme to loot
this old man's estate. She isn't teliing the
truth. When she testified originally that
Quackenbush dictated that document of
acknowledgment and that no :orm had been
supplied by her attorneys I believe that she
knowingly stated what she knew to be false. I
contend that I have a right to present this to
the court, as it goes to the credibility of the
witness.
This position was sustained by Judge
Seavrell, and the witness explained that
she did not unuer.-tand the question of
counsel. She thought reference waÂ« made
the original marriage contract, when she
swore that she had no form to go by in
drawing it up.
The case will go on at 10 o'clock this
morning.
ON TWO MORE BLOCKS.
Third Street Is Going to Have
More Electric Lights
at Once.
From Mission to Folsom Will B

More lights are going tip on Third street
and before the weefc is out the two blocks
from Mission to Folsom will cease to mind
the passing of the sun.
On Third street it is the property-owners
who are patting up the greater part of the
light fund and as they are not so accessi
ble as the merchants the fund is increas
ing more slowly. There is enough on
hand now, however, to cast the darkness
from two more blocks on Third street and
the necessary lights will be put in as soon
a 8 possible.
Those who have signed the subscription
fund for the two blocks from Mission to
Folsom are:

R. E. Snook, William Enrenpfort, David
Keil and Gus Harshali.
Charged With Burglary.
Gus Peterson, a laborer, 27 years of age, was
arrested early yesterday morning for visiting
an opium resort. An additional charge of
burglary was booked against him. He is ac
cused of breaking into the room of G. H.
Poole, one of hi* associates, and stealing a
gold watch, a silver watch and some clothing.
They Were Acquitted.
Ellis Swain and James Mulvey, the two
young men charged with an attempt to com
mit a criminal assault on Mrs. Belle Nava, the
wife of a barber, had their cases dismissed by

Special Reports.
A meeting of the Pacific Kennel Club
will be held this evening for the purpose
of hearing and acting upon the report of
the committee which was recently ap
pointed to interview its members on the
future of the club, viz.: whether it' will
disband or continue to exist.
In case the committee reports that a
majority of the members favor dissolu
tion, then in all probability the directors
will decide to disband, in which event the
Olympic Gun Club will give a bench show
this year in the Mechanics' Pavilion.

The Ones Who Are Marching Toward
Death and Do Not Realize It.
The official returns of the city of New
York show that more than one-third of all
deaths are from consumption, pneumonia
or grip. When we stop to calmly think
over this fact it seems really awful. And
yet every case, without exception, started
from small beginnings. A cough in the
morning; tickling in the throat; a thick,
ph legmy discharge: chilliness at night;
difficult breathing; a tightness across the
chest; these and many more symptoms
indicate the presence of that terrible dis
ease which, unless checked, means certain
death with long painful suffering. .
Id view of such serious and ever-present
facts the suggestions and advice of the
most eminent physicians are of the great
est value. â¢
Dr. John Gardner, one of the most emi
nent physicians in London, says: "Sci
ence, common-sense, Holy Scriptures, and
all experience testify to the benefits de
rived from the use of pure whiskey."
. Dr. D. H. Barker says: "I have used
and examined Duffy's pure malt whiskey,
and find it the best I ever tried."
These truths should serve as a guide for
all who feel the approach of consumption,
no matter by what path it may come. We
do not hesitate to assert that any man or
woman who will use Duffy's pure malt
whiskey according to directions can defy
consumption and prolong life with all its
blessings.

TAKING THE BROAD VIEW.
The Answer to the Comp aint of the
Company Filed by Attorney-Gen
era Fitzgerald.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald yesterday
yiiei an answer to the complaint of the
â 4 ..hern Facific Compauy against the
-t 7 .Board of Railroad Commissioners, in the
â  a:aon to have the board restrained from
enforcing its 8 per cent reduction in grain
rates ttnd the 25 per cent reduction in
other freight rates proposed.
The answer makes some strong home
thrusts against tne defendants. It de
c'ares the Southern Pacific Company to be
an unlawful organization, having violated
the laws, State and Federal, and the State
constitution in leasing and operating the
several roads mentioned in the biil.
declares that the company has no
right to an injunction, because it
has a recourse at law in defending
Bgainst suits to enforce the rate,
and that the board cannot be
restrained, as it does not attempt to en
force the rate, its function being wholly
legislative. The complainant, it says, is a
corporation of another State, ana is not
authorized to do business in this State,
ei<ept upon such terms and conditions
and in obedience to such laws, rules and
regulations as the State of California
chooses to enact, and is in no position to
complain of the provisions of the consti
tution or laws of the State of California,
or of anything done under them by any
board or officer of the State.
Tue document is a lonÂ«c one, but full of
neat and interesting reading to tne ship
pers of the State. In the first place it is
denied that the Southern Pacific Company
is, or has been, operating lawfu ly any of
the roads described in the bill under any
lease. It is averred that the so-called
leases mentioned in the bill are invalid,
and of no effect whatever.
Having no information sufficient to en
eb c them to answer the point the
defendants deny that the complainant
has ever bad a paid-up capital stock of
$120,934,170, or any paid-up capital stock.
It is denied that the Southern Pacific
holds a lease from the Oregon and Califor
nia Railroad Company, and for lack of
ii formation it is denied that the Oregon
I and California has a paid-up capital of
1 JH.000.000. It is also denied that any of
* the lines mentioned in tne bill are held
under a lease from the Central Pacific.
Tne same denial is made a. so as to the
alleged $67,275,000 of the capital stock of
the Central Pacific
The same denials as to lease from the
California Pacific Railroad and as to the
alleged $12,000,000 capital stock of that
road, also as to the Northern California
Railway Company and its alleged $12,
--896,000 capital stock, also as to leases from
the Northern California Railroad Com
pany and its alleged capital stock of
$1,280,000, also as to leases from the
South Pacific Coast Railway Company
and as to its alleged capital stock
of $6,000,000 also as to leases from the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company and
as to its alleged capital stock of {68,402.
--feOO, also as to the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company of Arizona and a 9 to its al
laged capital stock of $19,995,000, also as
to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
of New Mcx co and its alleged capital
stock of $6,888,800.
It is denied that none of the corpora
tions mentioned in the bill, other than
the California Pacific Railroad Company
and the Northern Railway Company, have
or more than one year received ani been
entitled to any profit above their actual
expenses, or that any of them have paid
dividends to stockholders. It is averred
that in 1894 the Southern Pacific Com
pany aereed with Sir Rivers Wilson, the
representative of the English stockhold
ers of the Central Pacific Company,
that the Southern Pacific Company
would pay to the stockholders of
the Central Pacific Company a dividend
of 1 per cent per annum until "satisfac
tory legislation" could be obtained for the
adjustment of tne company's debt to the
Government, and that after such legisla
tion to pay 2 per cent for a period of two
years, and that that agreement was kept
and the dividend paid during 1894, 1895
and 1896.
It is averred further that the payment
of this dividend of |672,000 per year was
kept secret and not disclosed to tiie court
/.pun the hearing cf the preliminary in
-1 lion.
"^ A specific denial is made of the aliega-
V s of the complainants as to the in
debtedness, the gross earnings and the
taxes levied and paid. On this basis it is
denied that any reductions in freights
proposed by the Board of Railroad Com
missioners would, if they bad been en
forced for the year 1894, have resulted in
any diminution of the reventfe of theSouth
eru Pacific Company or the Central Pa
cific Railroad or would have amouated to
$1,775,000 or in any sum; but it is
fverred instead that such reduction
would have resulted in an increase of
business and of the profits thereof.
The Railroad Commission further de
nies the correctness of the reports of the
company as to cross earnings and as to
its expenses, and denies thai the proposed
reduction would make any difference in
tho relationsnip of these two, except for
the betterment of the company.
It is denied that the services of its
oincers have been secured as cheaply as
possible and avers that "it is notoriously
true that for many y/ars last past the
Southern Pacific C>myany has expended
large sums of money in the employment
of politicians and others to improperly
influence various, branches of the Federal
and State governments and to obtain for
itseU advantages to which it is not
entitled," ana that a large part of the
sum named as operating expenses is ex
pended for such unlawful purposes.
With regard to construction expenses it
is averred thai a larger part if not all of
the supplies and material for the roads
have been obtained through subsidiary
icompajiies, composed of its own officers
{and certain stockholders, and has paid
Jfherefor much greater sums than the
|ame could otherwise have been obtained
for to the fraudulent advantage of the per
sons composing these subsidiary com
panies.
Answering the allegation that the
rates in many cases are now fixed at
the,actual cost of transportation by rea
son of competition with other carriers by
railroad and water, it is averred the rates
were never fixed so low in any instance,
except where it is the object of the South
SHOULD EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS BE TAXED?
Rev. F. D. Bovard Makes a Scholarly Plea for Exemption for Churches and Benevolent
Centers From Burdens That, He Says, Are a .
"Reproach to California/
President Jordan bas recently set forth some strong reasons why the State should not tar the Stanford University. "There is no
State in the Union that receives outside gifts in so cold a spirit as California" applies not only to Stanford but to every private edu
cational institution in the State. It is a noble spirit In Mrs. Stanford to meet the annual deficit of the university from her private
resources, but she Is not tbe only victim of the policy of this great commonwealth. There are hundreds who give in smaller amounts,
but in the same spirit of se'f-denial, to piece out the inadequate endowments reduced by State taxation.
California by an unfortunate construction of the old constitution in 1868 began and under the new constitution continued an
anomalous course toward her private benevolences by taxinc everything in sipht. This "6old spirit" nas driven many of the princely
fortunes out ot the State and set the current of charity t 'ay from popular benevolence, bringing nearly every private edncntlonal
Institution intheSt'teto the verge of financial despair. Persons well d'srosed toward benevolent enterprises will not give their
asÃiÃtance to institutions whose doors will sooner or later be closed by the Tax Collector. Neither Stanford nor any other institution
whose endowment is taxed can permanently endure-. It Is not a question of money alone, but the apparent scorn and contempt
accompanying taxation of a benevolence that antagonizes and discounts the motives which project and sustain a great institution.
The low huckstering spirit that takes into the account simply the economic man, ignoring the higher and nobler element of human
life, will Gradually ossify nnd fossilize every instinct for refinement and culture, without which the State must fall to the rear in the
final march to victory.
The educational institutions do not stand alone in this matter. "No other Sate in the Union," nor in the civilized world, treats
her churches "in so cold a spirit as California." Auam and again have the churches been driven from their locatlDn by the Tax
Colleotor. They have been compelled to move awÂ«y from the centers if population and relocate upon obscure streets. There is no
State in the Union with such poor churches. The average tax upon each church is more than $10 per month. Nearly $3,000,000 is
spent annually for tbe moral and religious training of the citizens of this State, and that, too, by less than 10 per cent of the popula
tion. The State will not Rll^w her church corporations to engage in any business for gain, and yet they are taxed precisely the same
as the factory in the same block . How can suoh a law be juat ?
The church does not exist for itself, but for the State. The church member does not need th 3 church any more than his neighbor.
Every reason that can be urged for the exemption of free libraries, educational institutions, must appeal with still greater force to the
State 1n behalf of the churches. Can the Civil Cod9 stand if the m ral code is allowed to crumble down ? Has not moral deteriora
tion already set in? A lawyer of wide practice told me in th" presenceof a Congregational clergyman within ten days that perjury was
the rule in every case. A high official, himself in business in Oakland, Haid he was prepared to speak lor nine-tenths of all the merchants
on Broadway, an ! that thpy would take the ground. squarely that gambling and pool-selling was a good thing for the "town." We do
not know under what code they would arrest a clerk for robbing their tills. While we do not fully accept these statements, yet there is
reason for a careful study of California morals. There is sound tissue, but strong ryidence of disease. Can anything take the place of
that reverence for law, that sense of duty toward the community, that orderly self-reÃtraint arising from the acceptance of the csrdlnal
doctrines of Chrisfanity ? By what power is it proposed to control the masses, stung by poverty, weltering under a sense of injustice,
when the consolations, the hopes, and the softening restraints of religion are withdrawn? It is utterly vain to ta'k of "natural percep
tions af right" Â»Â«eubÃti<utes for reli"ion. Nothing but the glistening bayonet, the measured step nnd the haughty command of mili
tarism can preserve ord*>r when religion is dethroned. With the decline of religion come bribery, jobbing, perjury and moral and in
tellectual death. Patriotism has never stood alone. Washington said in his farewell address:
"Whatever may be conceded to th" influence of refined education, reason and experience both forbid us to expect a nation's moral
ity can prevail in exclusion of the religious principle."
This is not a nutter of sentimentality. California has made no provision for the moral and religious training of her citizens. It
is a mistake to suppose that the church carries on its work for sectarian purposes. Tnere U not 1 per cent of all the vaÃt sum raised
for religious work in the State trnt has the sMghtest reference to mere propagandism. The whole motive of the church is fidelity to the
highest interest* of the citizen, and to <his end it may challenge comparison with any non-sectarian institution in the United States. It
stirs the compassion of the rich toward the poor, brings consolation to the sick, relief to the needy, contentment and patience to the
discouraged and in a thousand ways softens the asperities of life, and makes the protlem of government comparatively simple.
Of all the poison-tipped innuendoes hurled at the church that of "sectarianism" is the most unjust. BecauÂ«e the various churches
ftdheretodifferentmethods.no matter what their spirit and Rims, tbe cry of "sectarianism" Is raised. Would it be just to Stanford
University because it has "college spirit." flios its cardinal colors, "yells" after a fashion as different from the Berkeley "yell" as the
rsalm-sineinjr of one denomination differs from the more lively tunes of another, to cast it out as "sectarian" snlt having lost its savor?
Or bfcause it is $ compelled by its charter to teach that there is a personal God and that the soul is immortal, would the State De justified
in declaring it "sectarian" and displace the trustees? What is this malady so 6neeringly called sectarianism and which disqualifies
church people for citizenship in a.country which owes everything it is above paganism to the doctrines promulgated by the churches?
Is it to hold up before the youth of the Ptae a pure and exa 1 ted type of righteousness; to lift up for an example a stainless character;
to insist on the eternal difference between right and wrong; to teaoh self-denial; to subdue the wild, rnde energies of man into the
tender amenities of civilized life? These are the things undertaken by the churches. Now, in all candor, what good thing does the
non-sectarian do that tbe ''sectarian" does not try to do? Whenever non-sectarianism can point to a spot ten miles square in this
State, or on the face of the earth, where property, reputation and life are safe, and where a man can bring up nis family decently and
yet has no church, then and not till then shall we join in the hue and cry against "sectarianism," but until then we must think it sheer
prejudice.
Taking it for granted that the ends of all educational agencies are the same, it is difficult to understand how the State can take
from the endowment of one and add It to another. Put the case another way: Suppose that the appropriation to the State University
exactly equaled the tax collected from the churches and from the endowments of other educational institutions in the State, then one
institution would be clearly subsisting upon the others, and though this is not literally truo the effect on the benevolences under taxa
tion Is precisely the same as if it were.
Let California submit an amendment to the constitution which will relieve all educational institutions from taxation, and spe
cially the houses of worship and the ground upon which they stand from this burden, and she will double her population in ten years
and her reproach will be taKen away. jr. rj. Bovard.
ern Pacific Company to crush ont opposi
tion and destroy the property uf com
peting common carrier 3 .
It i< further averred that large expendi
tures have been made by the unlawful
combination of corporations controlled by
the Southern Pacific Company for the sole
purpose of shutting out competition and
destroying the interests of other common
carriers and perpetuating the control of
the complainant over the commerce of the
Btate. The company recoups itself for
thesÂ« expenditures and for the low rates
fixed at certain localities by this unlawful
combination and by unreasonable and un
just increase of rates in other localities,
"all in order 10 perpetuate its monopoly
of the business of transportation in the
State and stifle competition and drive all
competitors from the market."
It is averred, further, that the com
plaint of the Southern Pacific Company
in making application for an injunction
did not properly present the resolution of
the Railroad Commission providing for
fhe reduction wnich it complains of, but
undertakes to mislead the court with re
gard to a general reduction of freight
rates. "It was and is the intention of
said board," says the answer., "before pro
ceeding to make schedules in pursuance
of said resolution as to commodities other
than grain to investigate and inquire into
the conditions and circumstances sur
rounding, bearing upon and affecting the
traffic and rates of charges of said rail
roads in the State of California."
The .commission denies that it has
threatened to or intends to harass the
railroad comnanies with a multiplicity of
actions, or that it fixed the rate in the
present instance arbitrarily, but that on
the contrary it gave the railroad a full
hearing, the compan being represented
by its attorneys. It is denied that the
rates fixed are unjust or would be con
fiscatory of the property rights of the
company.
The commission denies that they ever
threatened to reduce the passenger fares
of any of the roads mentioned, but they
deny also that any such reduction ot fares
will prevent the roads from paying ex
penses, but on the contrary such reduc
tion would result in an increase of busi
ness and protus.
Denial is made that Commissioners La
Rue and Stanton pledged themselves by
their party platform to make reduction of
rates without regard to the justice of the
act. It is averred that all ot the members
of the board before taking any of the
acton complained of made a thorough
and complete investigation of the
freight and grain rates of all the com
panies mentioned, hearing many wit
nesses and giving the attorneys of
the railroad ail the opportunity
they desired to be heard. It is denied that
the actions of La Rue and Stanton as mem
bers of the board in voting for the reduc
tion were not in good faith and the result
of a bona-fide determination that the re
ductions proposed were just and reason
able.
It is denied that the members of the
board will proceed to enforce the rates of
freight fixed by the grain-rate resolution,
but they aver that obedience to the rates
fixed by the board is to be enforced by
criminal proceedings, to be instituted and
Frosecuted by other officers of fhe State,
tis denied that the rait is a controversy
between citizens of different States, "and
In this behalf aver that the State of Cali
fornia is the real party in interest in the
defense of this sun."
The answer then seta forth that the rail
road company is not entitled to the relief
asked lor, for a number of reasons:
Firitâ Because there Is an adequate remedy
at law for auy and ail of the matters set forth

REV, MR. BOLTON
INFORMS DR. LAW
Lucidly Explains His Cer
emonial Direc
tions.
But Calmly Ignores the Personal
Attack ot the Oakland
D.vine.
Justifies Ru e 29, Which Wai More
Particularly Referred To by
His Opponent.
Rev. W. W. Bolton, pastor of the Church
of Bt. Mary tho Virgin in this City, does
not recognize the propriety of personalities
among gentlemen of the cloth, and de
clines, therefore, to stimulate the appetite
of the Rev. V. Marshall Law of Oakland
for such a phase of polemics by any pro
fessional retaliation of his fierce attack
from the pulpit of the Church of the Ad
vent last Sunday.
Dr. Law saw fit to take exception to Mr.
Boiton's method of administering the
holy communion, observing in this con
nection that "not content to compel his
communicants to drink from a common
cup, wheretiy they are brought in contact
with unclean lives and possibly contagion,
he uses his own lips to cleanse the rim of
the chalice." A small pamphlet contain
ing Rev. Mr. Boiton's annual rfd ress to
the members of St. Francis Ward of the
Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament,
together with certain ceremonial direc
tions, furnished the text of Dr. Law's
philippic, in the course of which he denied
the claim of the author, that these direc
tions are the general use of the Anglican
communion.
Rev. air. Balton, when seen yesterdÂ«?y
and questioned on the subject of Dr.
Law's attack, said he must refuse to take
any notice of the actual language used by
Pr. Law toward a brother tlergyman as
benii; "ao entirely uniuinisterial." Ke
ferring to the pamphlet itself he said:
''The Confraternity of the Blessed Sacra
ment, whove pamphlet on ceremonial
directions has been taken exception to by
Dr. Law, is an organization stretching all
over the world. Its objects are as stated
| in the pamphlet: (1) The honor due to
the person of our Lord Jesus Christ in the
Blessed Sacrament of His Body and
Blood; (2) mutual and special interces
sion at the time of and in union witl) the
Eucharistic Sacrifice; (3) to promote the
observance of the Catholic and primitive
practice of receiving the holy communion
lasting.
"There is a ward of this confraternity in
this City, to which members throuehout
California belong, and of which I am the
superior. That pamphlet contains my
annual address at the least of Corpus
Christi in 1896, and was sent to every
member in the State and to every clerev
man of the Episcopal dioceses of Calf
fornia. The ceremonial directions would
naturally be of first consequence to the
clergy. In the preface are these words,
which certainly do not make for warfare
among ourselves: 'They are placed in
your hands that you may pass them on to
some relative or friend in the sacred min
istry whose high privilege it is to stand
before the Lord at his altar. If this be
done with that Christian charity that
should actuate us in all our dealings with
those of our brethren who cannot see
things spiritual just as we ourselves do
look at them we believe that these direc
tions, far from givin* offense, will be re
ceived with many and grateful thanks. 1
"The Confraternity is not a secret soci
ety, and all its doings are open to the light
of day. These directions have also been
sent to many of the clergy in other States
and have been most, kindly received. The
hope has been expressed by them that in
time a much greater similarity of ceremo
nial than has heretofore prevailed in the
Episcopal church may result from this ini
tiative on the part of the Californian
clergy.
"With respect to Dr. Law's interpreta
tion of the passage which deals with the
cleansing of the chalice by the lips of the
clergyman, I would say t< at be evidently
supposes that after each rail full of com
municants has been disposed of the priest
is directed to cleanse the rim of the chalice
with his own lips, whereas the rale itseif
(rule 29, page 13) expressly states:
29. When he returns for the Chalice he first
places Clborium from whence ho took it, then
genuflecting, takes the Chalice. Returning
after communicating the people, he cleanses
the lip* ol the Chalice with his own lips,
places upon it the Pall, then covers both
Chalice. Paten and Ciborlum with the "fair
linen cioth" or white veil of lace and genu
flects.
'â This means that the chalice mast be
thus cleansed after the last communicant
bar, taken the sacrament. The reason for
observing this rule is to prevent the ab
sorption of any portion of the sacrament
by the linen which is placed over the
mouth of Ihe chalice at the close of the
communion. To permit the linen to ab
sorb any portion of the sacrament wiiich
human beings should alone partake of
would scarcely he conducive to a reveren
tial attitude. The rule specifies the almost
universal practice which has been handed
down from generation to generation. I
may add that tbe future Darts of these
directions will be published as soon as we
have the necessary means at our disposal.
These will deal with low muss witb a
server, high mass, solemn hi.'h mass, the
canon, the triptych and others."
Rev. W. W. Bolton stated that he had
mtiie a special study of ritualistic observ
ance^ for twenty years and considered
himself competent, therefore, to express
an opinion. __^_____

MODJESKA PLAYS
AT THE BALDWIN
The Polish Actress Makes
Her Entree in
"Magda."
New Acts in " The Devil's Auc
tioa"âDebutantes at
the A.catraz
A Female Rival to Sindow at th.
Orpbeum â " Maritana" Revived
at the Tivoli.
An audience that almost filled the Bald
win Theater assembled last night towel
come Mine. Modjeska back to the stage.
Suderruann's powerful piece of character
drawing, "Magda," had been chosen
for the opening bill and in the
title rule the star was supported by a
specially selected company, which con
sisted to a considerable extent of local
talent
The he:oine of "Magda" does not ap
pear till the second act, so the whole
bouse was seated and expectant- before
Mme. Modjeska made her entrance. She
was gree c 1 with an ovation on her en
trance, but the Polish actress is too essen
tially an artist at heart to interrupt the
action of a drama by tripping to the foot
lights and bowing her acknowledgments.
San Francisco audiences are fairly fa
miliar with the plot of "Magda," indeed
Mme. Modjeska has played it here her
self, and it is sai.i to be one of her favorite
roles. The play is not so familiar, how
ever, that it can be thoroughly enjoyed
when the lines are not audible, and
Modjeska's voice was very weak
bt*t night, so much so that there
were speeches when the hearers had to
depend on her expressive face and their
own knowledge oi the story <o catch the
drift of what she was saying. At times
the tragedienne threw off this weakness
and spoke so that her worda could be
heard in the remotest part of the theater,
as for instance in the first scene with the
hypocritical councilor and in the heavier
scenes with her lather, but ii was in the
conversational poitions of ihe play where
interest is apt, to fl.ig most that the gifted
ac'res-b wa- most inaudible.
Modjeska's Interpretation of Magda
was fascinating, intensely womanly and
powerful, wuere fierceness was required,
but the bad scarcely the animal spirits, so
to speak, to invest the singer with the
recklessness, the headstrong chafing
against moral and parental restraint and
the love of vagabondage which make
Magua's actions and character consistent.
The Magda Just night was a beautiful,
wouianiy Deinn, with no underlying sug
gestion of the tigress, no disreoutabie part
to harden and corrupt her.
Joseph Haworth played the rols of
Major Bchuuert, Magda's fathei, on the
wbo c, i:i a powerful and satisfactory man
ner. Hss makeup was realistic and he en
tered with force into the strong scenes
with Magda and the councilor, though his
voice wa- somewhat gentle and caressing
in its accents for the stern old martinet of
a soldier; in fact, Jiaworth's^tock of stern
ness was scarcely large enough for the de
mands of the role of the m.tjor.
Miss Frances Jolliffe quite surprised
even her warmest friends in the role of
Marie. It may have been stage fright
that nerved her on to make a supreme
effort, lor the real feeling and the perfect
naturalness with which she played her role
savored very little of the deDutante. It
Miss Jolliffe does as well as tuis again and
does it often sue wiU make a name for
h rself.
Eor an actor who is almost nnknown to
fame Lester Lone gan did splendid work
as the rector. In his scene of renuncia
tion with Ma.dii there were real tears in
his voice and eyes. It is hard to say why
George Osbourne, as the Councilor,
adopted a make-up that caused one to
think of a pork-butcher and a manner
that seemed to be perpetually acting:
"How many cents worth did you say you
would buy?" A man of Osbourne's ability
should i.aye made the Councilor more at
tractive; as it was, bis appearance was an
insult to Magda's taste.
At tha Orpheum.
New at the Orpheum this week are Alcide
Capitaine, Bessie Clayton and a special gro
tesque dance by Arnold Kiralfy himself.
Miss Capitaine is an aerial acrobat, and her
performance captured the audience. She does
daring feats on swinging bars, and the colored
lights that are thrown on this young woman
while in midair enow that the greatest physi
cal culture has but developed the beauty of
her figure.
Kiralty sandwiches himself in between evolu
tionsof the shapely coryphees 01 the ballet.
HU dance is extraordinary in its eccentricity.
Mr. Kiralfy was unfortunate in receiving only
scattering applause.
Morosco'a Grand Opera-Home.
The five-act comedy-drama, "The Orphans
of New York," was put on at the Grand Opera
house last night for this week, before a large
audience. The scenery and situations are
quite melodramatic at times. One of the most
effective scenes is the burning of an orphan
asylum at night, from which the little gins in
their streaming white nignt robes are safely
led out by the nuns.
There is enough love, murder, humor, ex
plosives and thrilling situations to hold the
continued interest of the audience. Edward
J. Heron took the part cf "The Shiner," and
Rosamonde O'Conneli made an ideal nun, as
Sister Gertrude, 'ihe audience bestowed ap
plause in generous quantities.
At the Ale z:tr.
"All the Comforts of Home" was revived last
night at the Alcazar to a crowded house. Miss
Juliet Crosby, a local debutante, made her first
appearance at this house and proved to be a
very pretty and promising young actress. It
was an evening of debuts, for Miss Gertrude
Tidball has appeared but once.
Tivoli Opera-Bouse.
"Maritana" was presented last night by one
of the best casts the Tivoli has ever offered.
It is a relief to hear this company in straight
roles occasionally, and each and every member
of the cast was received with enthusiastic en
cores. Mr. Thomas made a splendid Don
Caesar, acting and singing the part in a man
ner quite equal to that of any of his prede
cessors. W. W. West was quite as much at
horn 1 in the King of Spain as the Irishwoman
ot "Jack and the Beanstalk," and that is say
ing a great deal.
Horse Show at the People's Palace.
Bristol completely fills the stage this week
at the People's Palace with bis beautiful edu
cated horses, poniss and mules. This is the
"equus curriculum" that appeared last week
at the Chutes.
"The Devil's Auction" at the Columbia last
night was diversified by several new acts,
dances, etc., the chief of which was an aerial
act by the grotesques Tonner and Fobel, who
substituted a bamboo pole for the ladder in
their irnt'v'ze act and, oue at each end, per
formed gymnastic feats.
Messrs, Friedlar.dcr, Gottlob & Co. are
negotiating for a concert at the California
Thenter with the famous singer Mile. Antoi
nette Trebelli as the star. She is a daughter
of Trebelli, the once famous contralto, and has
a soprano voice of great sweetness.

WHERE IS FISHER NOW?
Bis Family Has Not Heard From Him
Since His Financial
Collapse.
The whereabouts of Will E. Fisher, the
real estate agent who disappeared from
this City a weeK ago to-day, leaving his
affairs in a hopelessly wrecked condition,
is still unknown to his family.
A United Press dispatch yesterday from
St ckton to one of the evening papers here
said:
"Will E. Fisher, the San Francisco real
estate agent, is in Stockton now. He is
being concealed by a private detective,
who will allow no one to see him. Fisher
claims that all his business matters will
be straightened out; that nis friends are
now working to this end.
"Fi-her has been sick here."
This information, while not new to the
family, has not been substantiated by any
reliable private .nformation. Several days
ago, it seems, a telephone message came
to the Fisher residence, 1210 Slitter street,
saying, in iffect, that the missing real es
tate dealer was there in hiding.
Fisher, however, has not communicate. l
with or been heard irom by his family
since he was last seenâ a week ago io-day.
He had not been at home later than two
days preceding that.
The members of the Fisher household
and the intimates of the family know of
no friends who may be intending to see
that all claims are paid.- They assert that
Fisber'3 affairs are hopelessly involved
and tnev further say that they do not see
where Fisher had any money to hire a de
tective as he wa< not known to have had
any cash with him.
The friend who came 1o his rescue in a
similar financial difficulty on a former
occasion is not atrain idvancmg money.
E. B. Jenninss speaking last night lor
Mr. Fisher said:
"There are about sixty creditors, con
fined almost entirely to this City. An
effort is now being made by Charles S.
Neal, the assignee and representative of
the Fair estate, to have the creditors sign
a petition of claims in order to force a sale.
A committee, consisting of P. Blake, C. S.
Neal and myself, has been appointed to
submit the petition to the different credi
tors for their - gnatu res."

NEW YORK MARKETS
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 24 -Speculation at the
Stock Exchange was quiet again today, the sales
aggregating only 129. 953 shares. In this small
total sugar figured for 19.500, Burlington for
15.800 and St l'Â»ul 12,300. The opening was
quiet, following which an advance of I.4 ft. 1 per
cent took place. This was partly the result of a
reduction in the posted rates of sterling exchange
Of 2 c from $4 85y 2 @4 87y , and partly because
the bears did not continue their raid of Saturday.
Tee loss in St. Pan 1 earnings for the third week of
January, which proved to be much smaller than
expected, was also used with good effect. London
again sold in the local market, parting with 5000
shares of various stocks-
In th â¢ industrial group General Electric was no
tably firm on toe announcement of the deal for
the equipping of the Fourth, Sixth and Eighth
avenue surface lines had been perfected. Tobacco,
however, was down % to 73Vi on the legal com
plications of the company.
The feature of the afternoon trading was the
heaviness or the anthracite coalers. Lackawanna
fell 2V-j to 152: Delaware and Hudson, 2% to
lU63'Â«: Jersey Central, 2y b to 98, and Heading, 7 /8
to 26 s/ 8 .
The selling was based on the belief that the an
nual reports of the larger companies now about
doe will compare unfavorable- with previous years.
Statements that the New York and Kscanaba,
one of the Delaware and Hudson leased lines, had
Issued *1,0U0,000 of 41/2 per cent gold debenture
bonds last year led 10 ir<-e selling of Delaware-
Hudson shares and played right into the hands of
the bears. The general list yielded 2Vi from the
highest of the morning in sympathy with the coal
ers, bat in the final dealings there was a fractional
rally. The market closed weak in tone. Net
changes show losses 01 Vi.Â® s /8 per cent In the gen

CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 25.â There was scarcely
any trade in wheat at the opening or for an hour
tnereaiter this morning. A St. Louis bouse
I bought a little at the start. The amount taken
I would not have been noticed In an ordinarily
' active market, but with a quio'. 1 It it was not only
I observed but commented 1 1 he heavy snow
â  of Saturday, followed by the 1 xtremely low tem
-1 peratures of ~unday, were viewed as being of In
: calculable benefit to win wheat. The feeling in
the market was a trifle firmer at the openinv on
Liverpool's early advance of i/4.<X. but soon after
' ward a change in sentiment tooi place and prices
I eased off. The amount on ocean passage decreased
320.000 bushels.

noted. There was the usual indifference to trade
! exhibited, however, ana prices soon dropped lower
I in sympathy with those of wheat. Receipn were
1 291 cars and 18*5 bushels were taken from store.
The amount on ocean passage decreased 480, C00
bushels. Liverpool cables wer> quoted as un

portions. About 15,000 head came in, as com
pared with 704 last Monday and 12,131 on the

good demand and the extremely cold weather
made buyers and sellers a little more ready to
agree than usually. Well- finished stock was
sought for constantly. Supplies of bogs are fa'l
-ing . off Id the last few weeks. The receipts just
now are much larger than in recent years, but the
January receipts so far are less than that of the

THE STOCK MAKKET.
Mining stocks sold rather higher again on the
morning call, but subsequently weakened and
were lower in the afternoon, closing weak.
The Savage assessment falls delinquent in office
to-day.
The Pacific Auxiliary Fire Alarm Company haa
declared a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share,
payable February 15.
The annual meeting of the Pacific Rolling Mill
Company has been called for February 3.
The report of the Con. Cal. A Va. for the weak is
as follows:
| 1000 levelâ The south drift started fiom the
wes'. crosscut at v point 124 feet In from the top of
the upraise from west crosscut 2 from the ncrth
drift from the Con. Va. shaft station has been ex
tended 20 feet, passing through porphyry, clay and
quartz of low assay vilue; total length 35 feet.
1650 k-velâ We ure repairing aud easing timber*
on the ninth floor south drift, on the ninth floor
in the siope at v point 100 feet eas: and 25 feet
south of an east Hue from the Con. Va. shaft an
upraise has been started and carried up 18 feet,
passing through quartz and porphyry from which
a few tons of milling ore have ueen savtd. This
upraise will be earned up inclining to rlie west to
connect with the south drift, whern the streak of
good ore was recently found on the twenty-sixth
floor.
1760 levelâ From the twenty-sixth floor, at a
point 72 fei't In from tne mouth of the west drift,
a north drift hus been advanced 18 feet From
the end of this drift a w>st crosscut has been ex
tende t 42 ftet, passing through porphyry and
quartz of low assay value. From the tenth,
eleventh and sixteenth floors on the east side
above the sill floor of this levelâ at the north end
of the stopes in old ground oi former workings,
and from the sixteenth iloor on the west side of
the slop-, we have extracted 19 tons of ore. The
average assay valne. per sample taken from tbe
can in mine, was 925 10 a ton. From the west
drift at a point 191) feet in from its inoiitn. the
north arift has been advanced 19 feet, passing
through porphyry, clay and quartz assaying 92
and $3 a ton; total length, 39 feet. Opposite the
north drift the south drift hus been
advanced 10 feet; total length, 80 ie-t.
This drift wheu advanced 25 te-t showed a
streak of ore 15 inches wide on the west
side of the drift and 18 inches wide on the east side
of the drift. Humpies taken across the face of the
drift from the streak assayed *72 05, $74 50 and
$381 40 per ton. Along the earn side of the drift
5 feel north from the face there is a widtn of 18
Inches of ore assaying over $200 a ton. We have
extracted from this streak about 3 tons of ore as
saying $217 ;i ton. which still remains In the drift.
Work here ras beÂ»n suspended, as we cannot re
move the ore un ul an upraise connection hus been
made with our 1650 level, which I estimate will
take four weeks. We continue filling the open
space in tbe stopes between tbe eighteenth and
twenty-sixth floors with fine rock. This work will
be completed during tbe coming week, and all the
places from which tbe bad air has been escaping
will tuen be clost-d. Ibe total extraction of ore for
the week amounted to 19 tons. Tbe average assay,
from samples taken from cars when raised to the
surtace, was $43 48 a ton."
In the Optiir mine, on the 1000 level, west croes

seams of cli y. > c the old Central tunnel wnr^iius
of the Ophir, from the west crO3Â« ut from the
Mcx can shaft. at a point 132 feet in from its mouth
from the south drift 60 feet in from Its mouth
from thÂ» upraise carried up 15 feet, they are re-
Opening an old west crosscut, and huve extracted
therefrom eight tons of ore assaying 524 42 per
ton.
In the Hale & Norcrosa mine, In upraise 1, 900
level, they have stopped the south drift from the
south end of the sixth floor, and started to upraise
3J feet south of upraise 1 in quartz and clay about
16 inches thick. The on; extracted is of low value,
U saved and put with old tilling* separate, in
upraise 2 have worked north aud west from the
ninth floor, only seams of ore are now In tne

THE BLACK BALL
The Ebell Society Has a
Secret Committee of
Three.
One Member Says the Club Has
"Ultra-Fashionables" and
"Ordinaries."
President Euanell Is Charged With
Being an Autocrat, Which Her
Friends Deny.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad way, Jan. 25. )
The fashionable Ebell Society Is seri
ously disturbed over the secret use of little
bJack balls. The beautiful Grecian temple
at Thirteenth and Harrison streets that
was dedicated with much eclat about three
months ago is now the scene of a factional
war, the cause of which is so much at
variance with the objects for which the
society wae formed tnat the efforts of the
members are about equally divided be
tween upholding their end of the contro
versy and trying to prevent the details
|/rom becoming known outside of the
charmed circle.
A short time since it was decided to in
crease the membership from 300 to 400,
and a sufficient number of applications
v, ere received to make the list complete, |
but, although several applicants were in !
every way worthy of becoming members i
bo far as their fitness to discuss "higher I
subjects" is concerned, they were quietly j
blackballed by a mysterious committee of j
three, whose identity is being very care- j
fully concealed.
Mrs. Alice W. Bunnell, the president of !
Hie society, names one lady, who appoints j
two more, and these three constitute the :
committee whicii parses on the names of
all applicants. The president refuses to
â¢ divulge their names and preserves a digni
fied silence that is very exasperating to
those who have been humiliated by the j
use of the little ebony balis. There was a
' time when all the members of the Ebell \
Society wer. 1 not nursed in the lap of lux- i
ury, and the feeling islmanifested that
there is a de-ire on tt-.e part of what one >
lady call? the ultra fashionables to frown
upon the "ordinaries." Acting on this i
â¢ idea the intellectual feature of the club has :
been â¢ subordinated to t.e social side and \
the outcome is in doubt.
â¢\V. at spires within the society i
does not Delor.g to the public," said Mrs.
Lunnell to-day. "'lt appears that some
one is inclined to think that I have made ,
myself an autocrat of (he society, because
I refused to divulge lie names of the com- |
mittee. I have nothing to say in regard i
â to the entire matter, for I believe that this j
is a question which concerns the society, |
and not the public."
One of the leading members of the
Eoeil, who has been on the roll since it j
Jirst started, gava the following synopsis :
of the situation this evening: "The start - s
of tbe whole matter," sue said, "was when !
the leaders tried to outdress each other.
There are many members ho could not
afford to follow the fashion, and conse
quently it was very apparent that the
Aclfth would "scon be transformed into a
â¢ very exclusive fashionable society. On
ifhe roll are many schoolteachers and
I'adies who maintain themselves. In the j
intellectual debates these ladies take a \
prominent part, and do not seem to be I
liked for doing so. This investigating
committee of three is all wrong, and mem- j
bership c houll De limited only by the
will of the club as expressed by a major
ity vote.
"Then, Pgain, there is too much gossip
at the lunches in the clubro.oms, and the
. Service is abominable. Covers are some
times prepared for 100, and twice that
number is invited. Then there is a
scramble for seats, and only two attend
ants are there to do the waiting.
"This secret committee, appointed by
the president, has the fate of every lady
REV. T. J. LACEY, M.A.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 25.â Word bas been received from the Key. Thomas
James Lacey, rector-elect of- Christ Episcopal Church, stating that he will not ar
rive until after Lent. He had been expected early in the next month. Rev. Hack
Â«U Smith, the explorer and lecturer, has agreed to remain here as a supply until
the rector's arrival.
The rector-elect was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, June 8, 1870, received his educa
tion in the public schools of his native city and was graduated from Hughes' High
- School in the class of '88. He then entered the University of Cincinnati and
studied three years finishing his collegiate education at Griswold College, Daven
port, lowa, while acting as assistant instructor in Latin.
Mr. Lacey began his theological studies in private under the personal direction
of Bishop Perry of lowa and then spent a year at the General Theological Semin
ary in New York, at the same time pursuing a post-graduate course of study in
1 the university of the city of New York. He was ordained deacon in St. Paul's
-Achurch, Cincinnati, Ohio, October 1, 1893, and immediately accepted a call to the
V sistantship of St. Luke's Church, San Francisco. Later he became headmaster
of Trinity School and was admitted to the priesthood in St. Paul's Church, San
Francisco, February 28, 1896.
Mr. Lacey has been an extensive contributor to the religious papers and maga
zines chiefly in the department of church history. He accepted an invitation last
fall to become assistant at St. Lutte's Church, Brooklyn, which position he re
linquishes to accept the call to Alameda. In 1895 Griswold College conferred on
Mr. Lacey the degrees of Bachelor or Divinity and Master of Arts. The new rec
tor hopes to arrive and enter on bis duty March 21, the third Sunday in Lent.
His mother will accompany him and remain several months.
in its hands, and a large number of wor
thy laUies will not apply for membership,
owing to the suspicion that attaches to
the secret committee. Who ever heard of
a society whose by-laws state that n was
organized for mutual culture requiring a
certain standard of dre*s and a certain
length of eenealogy as qualifications for
membership?' . . . ,
Mrs. A. \V. Bishop is a firm defender of
Mrs. Bunnell in the present upheaval.
"These stories are all the result of spite
work against Mrs. Bunneil, said Mrs.
Bishop to-day. "Our president has worked
hard for the success of the society for the
past six years, and thiÂ» is all the gratitude
that is shown her. It is an effort to drag
her down, and is spite work through and
through, and it is a shame that it has
gained *uch general headway. I cannot
believe tnat any one could spring such
stories concerning Mrs. Bunnell or accuse
her of antocracy."
H. O. Trowbridge, whose wife has been
one of the most active members of the
Ebell Society for the past two years, said
to-night that the real difficulty consists in
tbe point as to whether tne Ebell Society
is a social or a literary organization. "If
it is a social organization," he said, "then
the members have a perfect right to de
cide by any legitimate means who shall be
their companion and who shall not. If,
however, it is a literary society then there
should be no secrecy over the question of
admittance to membership. 1 am very
sorry that anything of this kind has oc
curred. But there is no more unpleasant
ness than is to be found in any purely so
cial society where membership is governed
by strict rules."
One of the young ladies who was mys
teriously blackballed is the daughter of a
prominent member, and her mother has
determined to know the secret of her
daughter's humiliation or else take such
steps as will end in the society adopting a
rule by which all applications for mem
bership shall be submitted to the general
body. *
BOUGHT THE PARK.
' Board of Works Takes the Step that
Will Blot Odt West Oakland's
Marsh.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 25.â The West
Oakland Park site was formally accepted
at a special meeting of the Board of Works
I held th'.s morning. The site purchased
] covers about eleven acres, and consists of
tbe two block- of marsh land bounded by
j Eighteenth and Twentieth, Campbell and
| Wood streets, and the price paid by the
I city is $6866. The West Oakland Improve
ment Association has worked hard to
j obtain a park and to permanently abate
! the marsh nuisance, and they are well
' satisfied with their efforts, for the plan of
improvement as previously outlined, is to
fill in the marsh and make the park at the
same time.
Before the Board of Works accepted the
bid ;in agreement wa< filed by the Pacific
Coast Dredging Company, in which it was
; set fort.li that as boon as the city pur
: chased the land and commenced to sell
i aiul improve the same, tbe company,
within thirty days thereafter, -will com
i raence to nil in all of the marsh bounded
\ by Twenty-second, Sixteenth and Peralta
! streets and the Southern Pacific tracks.
; Thi* is the result of an agreement made
â  with all the adjoining property-owners
before the bid was offered to the city.
Now that tae site has been selected the
i improvement association has called a
meeting for to-morrow evening to con
! -ider a plan for the improvement of the
pars when it shall have been filled up.

and Day to Defeat the Rail
road at Washington.
The Reaction After Success Proved
Too Much for His Brain.
He Will Recover.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 25.â Overcome
with anxiety and weakened by incessant
toil as a member of the Committee of
Fifty in his attempt to overthrow the
funding bill, William M. Coward of 2211
Ellsworth street, Berkeley, has lost his
reason. By constant and unabated effort,
both night and day, to undo the plans of
Collis P, Huntington be has given way to
WILLIAM M. COWARD, the Weil-Known Real Estate Man and
Member of the Committee of Fifty, "Whose Efforts Against
the Funding Bill Are Said to Have Caused His Temporary-
Men tal Derangement.
the demands upon hia strength and now
he is a physical and mental wreck. In
disconnected sentences and in partly in
coherent tones be talks of Hnntington
and the railroads.
"God has righted the wrong," says he;
"and now the poor people will be free."
For several days be has been talking in
this strain, but last night the crisis came,
and he gave way under the load, and was
to-day taken before the Insanity Com
mission.
During the time that Mayor Sutro was
gathering his forces to struggle against
the passage of the bill by Congress
Mr. Coward took a most active part in
the work of the committee, and a portion
of the time worked night and day. Hav
ing an extensive insurance and country
real estate business at 11 Montgomery
street, San Francisco, the extra work of
writing communications, gathering data
concerning the Pacific railroads and meet
ing committees began to sap his vitality,
but being a man of great firmness of pur
pose he kept up under the severe nervous
tension until the last.
The unfortunate man is full of ideas
concerning the funding bill and religion
and though he seems to be conscious of
all that is going on about htm he has no
power of thought or ability to express
himself.
This morning Town Marshal Lloyd
called at the residence of the unfortunate
man and decide! to take him before the
Insanity Commission. Accordingly he
was conveyed to Oakland. Before taken
away a number of friends called and at
tempted to converse with him, but with
out avail. Though not violent he seems
almost wholly devoid of his mentality
and can talk of nothing but the funding
bill.
Mr. Coward has a wife and four chil
dren in Berkeley. He has been residing
here for about six months, having pre
viously lived in San Francisco. Mrs.
Coward is grief-stricken, and for a long
time could not be prevailed upon to leave
her husband's side. She says that the
physicians assure her of his ultimate re
covery, but that some time will be neces
sary to build up his wasted energy.
When he first came to San Francisco
Coward was associated with Bovee, Toy &
Co., but later went into business for him
self in the building occupied until re
cently by O'Farrell & Co.
LOST ALL HIS FAMILY.
Edgar 1.. Cox, l>eÂ«ijondent and Ivoneljr,
Takes a Fatal Draught of
Morphine.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 25.â Edgar L.
Cox went to a room at 418 Tenth street
Saturday night, drank the contents of a
large bot'le of morphine and was found
i dead at noon to-day.
Judging from some memoranda found
in his room Cox's life for the past few
years has been peculiarly unhappy. On
one piece of paper dated last Saturday was
the following note: "I have lost my wife
and children; the children were stolen
from me by Miss Preston in Sacramento
some years ago. I have not been happy
since. My children was all I had to live
for. My dear little Mnllie, I have not seen
a happy day since I lost them; therefore
I will say good- by."
There was a pocketbook in the room
and also a Bible. On one of the leaves of
the former was written: "To whom it may
concern: I ask pardon for what I am. I
have no hones of ever seeing my children.
God bless them. If I could see my little
Mollie again thÂ«o I would have hope.
Good-by to all."
Cox was known to Mr. Hartor, who is
one of the people interested in the gospel
tent at Fourteenth street and Broadway,
and in a little note to the Coroner Cox
asked that all his personal effects be given
to Mr. Harter. Another memorandum
conveys the information that "Since I
wrote this I went out and had a good meal
and a good drink and n cigar. I have a
â¢brother, one earned E. F. Cox, in San
Francisco."
The unhappy man was a painter by
trade and has been known in this city for
some,years. He was always regarded as a
steady workman, but for several months
he has been unable to procure employ
ment, and this, with his brooding over his
domestic trouble, caused him to be de
spondent and become tired of li.c.
A Burglar In Her Bedroom.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 25.â Miss Vinnie
comb, who resides at the residence of Mrs.
Rebecca Knox, was disturbed in her
slumbers early yesterday morning by a
burglar, who was inspecting the bureau
by the light of a candle. As soon as she
saw the man, who had a big, fat, red face,
she screamed. The candle went out im
mediately and nothing more was seen of
tbe thief.
F;ora his methods the burglar evidently
knew something about the plunder he
was after. He had taken a flatiron from
the gas stove in the dining-room into tae
lady's bedroom, and evidently became too
frightened to use it. The police have been
looking for a man of his description for
some time, and his depredations have
been reported from many quarters.
A Fractured Skull.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 25.â Vance C.
Hollowell, by his guardian, has brought
suit asainst the Southern Pacific Company
for $50,000 damages for injuries received
last November, T;hen the plaintiff was
struck by a locomotive at Golden Gate.
Tue boy had his skull fractured, and it is
alleged that owing to the injuries he will
never regain his normal mental faculties.
It is also alleged that the accident was due
to the bell at the crossing, which was out
of order and did not give warning of the
approach of the train.
New Infirmary Physician..
OAKLAND, Cal., Jau. 25.â The Board
of Supervisors to-day appointed Dr. S. A.
Buteau visiting physician to the County
Infirmary at a salary of $75 a month in
the place of Dr. A. Shirk, whose position
was declared vacant
M'CLYMONDS MUST FIGHT
Professor Burrill of the High
School Wishes to Suc
ceed Him.
The Populist Candidate for Mayor
on tbe Religirus
Issue.
Oakland OrncE San Feajtcisoo Call.)
908 Broadway, Jan. 25. )
Superintendent McClymonds, who baa
become accustomed to looking upon his
situation in the City School Department
as a permanency has received notice that
when the Board of Education which will
take office next March appoints some one
to fill the office for the succeeding four
years he will have a strong competitor.
Professor E. F. Burrill, head of the lan
guage department in the Oakland High
School, issued a public statement to-day,
in which he says:
In order to forestall uncertain rumors, and
to be perfectly frank with all concerned, I
wish to annouTice my candidacy before the in
coming Board of Education for the office of
Superintendent of Public Instruction. I make
the announcement, assuming that the most
important educational office in the City ia
strictly a non-poiitical one, and that the only
requisite is personal fitness to administer Its
duties. It is accordingly as a competitor, not
as a contestant for the office, that I shall enter
the field.
This declaration from Professor Bnrrill
came as a great surprise to Superintendent
McClynfonds and his political suppcrters.
There will be several changes in the next
Board of Education, and it is stated that
Professor Burrill has obtained pledges
from many of the candidates for School
Directors before making known that he
was in the fight.
There are no complaints against the
present Superintendent, but the feeling
exists that wh-n a man has held a $3000
job for eieht years he has had his
share of political pie.
Dr. Buckland, the Councilman from the
Fifth Ward, will run as an independent
candidate to succeed himself. V. S.
Northey i* out with a petition as an inde
pendent Councilman from the Seventh
Ward.
Rev. Mr. Goodenough, the Populist can
didate for Mayor, gave an interview to
day in which occurred the following lan
guage: "I have very positive views about
the free library. There should be no cen
sorship exercised over tne literature of
any kind, either in the free library or
reading-room, except it be of an obscene
or profane character. There is no place
for religion in American politics. I am
opposed to any indorsement by religious
societies of any candidate. The issues to
be met are plainly political and have no
connection whatever with religious be
lief."

Is Very Weak. ,
OAKLAND, CaW Jan. 25.â John How
ard was held to answer this morning; for
being implicated in the death of Anna

Judpe Wood stated that he did not con
sider the evidence: connecting Howard
with the crime as of much weight except
the dying girl's statement. He said that

release on habeas corpus, but he did not
think it proper for him, considering the
gravity of the offense charged, to allow

INGLESIDE NOW
HOLDS THE HAND
Three Choices Win Recpsn
ing Day at the Local
Track.
Buckwa Took the Mile, Down
ing Captive and Other
Fast Ones.
Scimitar Was the First Favorite to
Fall â Tuxedo Ou'jumped the
Favorite G-illant
Ingleside track on this side of the bay
rÂ«opened yesterday, and there were no
lamentations, no expressions of regret on
the part of the talent. The track across
the bay is pleasantly situated and equally
as palatial in its appointments as the one
at Ingleside, but oh, my ! what hard luck
the favorites played in, to use a sporting
phrase. To be sure the first choices do
not all win at the track within a stone's
throw of the Pacific, but as a rule they
fare much better. While not the most
fastidious and fascinating card ever offered
a race-going public, the, attendance at the
local track yesterday was large, and the
eighteen bookmakers laying prices were
kept bnsy handling the coin offered.
The weather was mild and summer-like
and the members of the cripple division
were frisfy as two-year-olds. Three favor
ites won and three were beaten. The
downfall of the beaten favorites was ac
complished mostly by second or third
choices, and none of the successful horses
ran loose.
Ed Purser's wise old horse Backwa cap
tured the classic event of the card, the
mile run, starting a4to 5 choice. Picking
up 111 pounds and piloted by Henry Mar
tin, he took the lead from Captive before
a quarter of the distance had been trav
eled, and won without noticeable effort
from Wheel of Fortune. Captive, ridden
by Willie Martin, was the runner up for
some distance, and then fell back, finish
ing fourth, behind Greyhurst. The mile
was covered in 1:42.
Ed Games' brown gelding Collins
opened the day auspiciously for the favor
ites by starting an even money chance for
the openintr mile and a sixteenth run
and winning in a gallop from The Bach
elor, carrying the Corrigan colors and a 15
to 1 shot "in the ring.
The brown colt Scimitar, with "Skeets"
Martin up, was the favored one in the
betting among the seven starters that lined
up at the barrier in tU6 seven-furlong
dash that followed. The favorite ran a
good race, but could not overcome the ad
vantage guined by Minnie Ccc, against
whom 5 to 1 was laid, and was four lengths
behind Hoenitr's mare as the stand was
passed. Old Jack Richelieu took show
honors.
The maiden hurdle event over a mile and
a sixteenth, with four obstacles to clear,
was supposed to be a good thing for Gal
lant, which was played from twos down
to 6 to 5.
The old graj horse, imp. Autonomy,
also had a host of friends who accepted 2
to 1 laid about him. The gray showed in
front as usual, but gave way to Gallant as
the stretch was reached. Things now
looked comparatively easy for the favorite,
when suddenly Tuxedo got a move on
and, passing the leader, won hands down
in 1:56%. Autonomy was a fair third.
Opening in the betting in the fifth event,
a six- furlong spin, at odd* of even money,
Mobalaska receded to 7 to 5, and was
clowned quite handily by Kowalsky, the
second choice, who walked over the line
two lengths before the Corrigan entry.
Show honors went to Allahabad, a 60 to 1
outsider.
Pat Dunne's brown sprinter Preston
never will find much easier game than the
company he met in the final six-furlong,
and going to the post at the prohibitive
odds of 7 to 20, disposed of Peixotto at the
end without much difficulty. Sport Mc-
Allister, which made the running into the
stretch, was third.
NOTES.
The magnificent Spreckela cup to be
presented to the owner of the winning
horse of the race called in honor of the
president of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
is on exhibition at the Palace Hotel grill
room, and is assuredly a masterpiece of

602 Market Street,
the silversmith's and engraver's art. It is
the most beautiful trophy yet offered in
connection witn a race in this part of the
country, nnd is admired by all. The
Spreekela cup is down for decision in the
near future at Inpleside track.
The action of the California Jockey Club
in setting February 20 as the date for the
decision of the four-mile stake race, to be
decided at the Emeryville track, is shabby,
to say the least, yet perfectly in keeping
with the greedy, grasping policy of that
track. Some weeks ago the Ingleside man
agement, following the custom observed
by all first-class racing organizations, an
nounced that the four-mile stake event
would be decided on February 22. Wash
ington's birthday, thus affording the gen
eral public an opportunity of witnessing
the big race. Now at this late date comes
the ultimatum of the California Jockey
Club folks announcing that the long dis
tance affair on its calendar of events will
be run on February 20, just two days
prior to the Ingleside race. It looks lise
a bit of sharp practice on the part of the
people across the bay.
The Ingleside Association is boastine
over its card for Wednesday ("ladies'
day") and Secretary W. S. Leiike grows
jubilant at mention of it. Seldom has a
track in the West offered the public such
an excellent programme of events, all at
distances of a mile or over. The idea of
getting up such a card originated with
Ingleside's energetic and hard-working
secretary ana Mr. Leake is entitled to
much credit for doing away with the
"short-bred" distances that have such
little charms for patrons of the turf.
Wednesday bids fair to be a banner day at
the local track.
Collins, winner of the opening race, has
undergone the operation of nerving and
altogether is a pretty bad cripple.
"Curly" Shields says he thinks a hoodoo
hovers over his brown colt Scimitar. He
is an uncertain performer and has cost hts
owner many losing bets.
Captive didn't appear to be up to much
yesterday. He must have been sadly out
of form to liave been beaten so badly in
the ordinary time of 1:42 for the mile.
In a letter received by a turfman in this
City recently the news was conveyed that
the pooling privileges for the Montana
circuit will be controlled the coming sea
son by Ed Tipton.
Secretary Leake of the Ingleside asso
ciation is in receipt of a letter from
Colonel Sanders D. Bruce, in which that
gentleman states that tue Jockey Club
does not and never will own the Stud
Book. The Turf, Field and Farm of Janu
ary 8 also publishes the followlnsr im
portant notice to breeders from the pen of
Colonel Bruce:
Lear Sir: I desire to call your attention to
the following no.ice from E. C. Hopper, secre
tary of the American Turf Congress: "All
horses will have to be registered in Bruce's
American Stud Book before they will be per
mitted to start on Turf Congress tracks."
No foals of 1896 reported to the Jockey Club
and paid for to them hrve been reported to I
me, notwithstanding I have irequently re- |
quested them to do so and to pay over to me
one-half of the registration fees in accordance
with the agreement between me and the lockey
club.
Reports to the Jockey Club were made at my
request by circular issued in compliance with
that agreement with the understanding that
the payment of the registration fee of $2 per
head for native and !Â£3 for imported horses
would insure entry in the Stud Book and half
the fees would be paid to me for such entry.
As the Turf Congress rules require reg
istration in the Stud Book before a horse can
race on Turf Congress tracks the action
of the Jockey Club as &Dove stated there
fore disqualifies ail the foals of 1896 re
ported to them from racing on Turf Con
gress tracks, and disqualifies as well the
foals of other years reported to them and
not registered in the Stud Boot;. If, therefore,
you desire your foals registeied in the Stud
Book, it will be necessary for you to send me
a duplicate report for 1896, stating also such
mares as were barren, slipped foals and
were not bred in 1896 to make the record
complete. The Jockey Club has been paid $2
and $5 respectively for native and imported
horses, and by virtue of my agreement with
the Jockey Club entitles them to registry in
the Stud Book witnout additional charges to
the breeder. The rules rrohiDlt the repetition
of names, except by the addition of a numeral'
and claims tor names will be registered in order
of priority. By the withholding ot the foals
of 1896 the compilation of volume VII of the
Stud Book has also been greatly delayed.

William Alger of Boston, the eminent lec
| turer and divine, who has already signi
fied nis willingness to fill the Berkeley
pulp;t for a period of four month*. Dr.
Al#er will arrive on February 28, and will

National repute and Is spoken of as one
of the great preachers of the country. He

three years a.sro, when he preached to the
Unitarian Society for several weeks. He
was the missionary of the National Uni
tarian Association at the time of the or
ganization of the Berkeley cnurch.
A Lively < hate.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 25.â Special
Officer Cory had a peculiar experience
with one Charles Vino of Oakland yester
day, in which a footrace was a feature.
Vino fired a shotgun in an orchard near
tlie center of town, which attracted the
attention of the officer. While in pursuit
of the firearms ordinance violator Cory
inadvertently showed his star. Upon
seeine it Vino set op a hot sprint, fol
lowed by the officer. They ran tor a mile
or more, when Vino lost a shoe and was
forced to give up the chase. The spec
tacle of the officer chasing a shoeless vic
tim, elicited much attention along the
route of travel.

SHOT HIMSELF
OVER THE HEART
C. C. Nordhausen, an Oak
land Merchant, Has a
Narrow Escape.
There Is a Likelihood the Patient
Will Recover at St.
Luke's.
An E rly Mornin? Tragedy in the
Baldwin Hot.-l After a Pro
traded Debauch
C. C. Nordhausen, a guest at the Bald
win Hotel, touched the button yesterday
morning, and wben J. J). Pettit, a bellboy,
responded, informed nim in a matter-of
fact way:
"I want to go to St. Luke's Hospital."
The lad found the guest disheveled and
blear-eyed, lying on a lounge, his clothing
C C NORDHAUSEN.
charred as if by some application of a hot
iron or coal.
"Are you ill?"
"No; not very. I only shot myself, acci
dentally."
That was enough for the boy. He rani
as he never did before, and, while still out
of breath, he reached the cffi:B with the
ttartlinjr announcement that:
"Dere's a man what shot hisself up
stairs, and he wants to go toder hospital.'-
Manager Lake proceeded to the guest's
room, where he was joined by Dr. Tavlor,
who Hves in the house, and for whom he
had sent.
Nordhausen was suffering greatly, but |
refused all assistance,
A gasjet, unliKhteJ, was found to be j
turned on, emitting its deadly fluid, and. j
when his attention was called to it and it j
was turned off, he said:
''I don't care; let it aione."
The man had apparently endeavored to
commit suicide. He had been drinking
heavily since Saturday night, when he
registered at the hotel. His haunts had
been those of the tenderloin, where back
rooms abound, and when he returned to
his apartment at an early hour Sunday
morning he was very much the worse for
bis many libations.
During Sunday he repeatedly rang up
belltoys, who furnished him with more
liquor as he ordered it. His head was
bandaged in a manner that showel he
bad been his own attendant, and now it is
assumed that the ugly gash under the
towel was caused by a bullet he intended
to be a messenger of death.
The hotel people discovered an exploded
cartridge in the bathroom, and there was
another in the revolver which Nordhau-en
handed over, showing that two shots had
been tared. The second, and main wound,
was found about an inch above tne left
nipple, the bullet ranging inwurd to the
ribs and. around to the bark, where Dr.
Armstead of St. Luke's Hospital found it
under the skin.
The Baldwin people wired to Mrs. Nord
nausen at 1322 Adeline street, Oakland,
the wile of tne wounded man, and she
reached the hospital yesterday afternoon
with ncr nephew, C, J. Heesmean, who,
with his ur.ciÂ»\ nas been in the clothing
business at 1051 Broadway, Oakland.
Neither of the relatives could under
stand the cause of the man's rash act,
and, although the physicians declare there
is hardly any dancerof his death from the
wound inflicted, they gave strict instruc
tions that he should not be seen by any
strangers.
Scout the Idea of Suicide.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 25.â Mrs. Nord
hausen and Charles Heeseman, nephew of
C. C. Nonihausen, returned home to-night
after Visiting St. Luke 1 * Hospital.
"The stories of attempted buicide are
absolutely without foundation," said Mr.
Heeseman to-night. "Mr. Nordhau sen
went to San Francisco Saturday to meet a
party that was to accompany him to
Eandsburg, where he was to have gone
to-day. He only returned from Rands
bnrg last week, where he has a large busi
ness interest, which has proved a very
Buccessiul venture. He was to return to
day and was at the Baldwin, where he
always stays when across the bay. I saw
him and talked a long time with him to
day, and he assured me that he bad no in
tention whatever of taking his life. He is
a stranger to firearms and never carried
them in his life till he went to Randsburg.
â¢'His financial standing is good, and his
home relations are the most pleasant, and
1 am convinced that the whole affair was
an accident. It is only a flesh wound, and
had he contemplated suicide he would
never have inflicted such a wound as ho
is suffering from. The proprietor of the
Baldwin Hotel assured rue that there is
not a particle of truth in the story that
the gas in (iiÂ« room was turned on."
C. C. Nordhausen is one of the most
acdve business men in this City and a
director of the Board of Trade.
He came to this city from the South in
1876, and two years later he and his
brother, Ernest A. Nordhausen, opened a
email store on Broadway, between Fifth
and Sixth streets, which they conducted
until 1885, when they moved to Eleventh
street and Broadway. This latter store is
Btill conducted by a nephew, Charles F.
Heeseman.
When Ernest Nordhauson died last
April Charles fell beir to part of his sav
ings, and in October he sold the store to
his nephew and retired Jrom basine-s.
During the summer, however, he had
taken a trip to Europe and through the
j East. Ii is estimated that he is worth
about $75,000.
Tne Reliance building on San Pable ay
! anue and Seventeenth stiryt was the joint
property of tue two biotuers. Besides a
wife Mr. Xordhausen has lour children,
the oldest about 15 years.
Mr. Mordbausen was public spirited,
taking great interest in every project ad
vanced for the city's interest, and alto
gether was one of the most popular mer
chants on Broadway.

SUPERVISORS VOTE TO BOND
THE CITY TO BUILD SEWERS
The Legislature Requested to Enable the Board to
Bring the Question to an Issue.
This Decision Was Reached
Speedily and Unanimously
Yesterday.
TWO INTERESTING INTERVIEWS I
Mayor Phelan and Ex-Mayor Sutro
Say That They Consider the
Action Premature.
The Board of Supervisors voted yester
day afternoon to ask the representatives '
of San Francisco in both branches of the
Legislature to work for an act to enable :
trie board to submit to the taxpayers of- j
this City and County a proposition to j
issue 4 per cent bonds to run forty years, j
No amount of bonds which it is proposed â¢
to ask for was mentioneu. The purposes ;
for which the bonds are to be issued are,
as set forth in a preamble and resolution, |
"to complete a sewer system compatible
with its (San Francisco's) growth and
reeds, and to clear itself of a just in
debtedness, which wns contracted in the
legitimate pursuit of its business."
This was the last matter to come before j
the board yesterday. To the astonish
ment of Mayor Phelan, which he audibly ;
expressed immediately after the adjourn- ;
ment of the board, the preamble and reso- j
lution were passed without any cebate i
arid unanimously. The terms of tiie reso- j
lution are in exact accordance with the I
terms of a petition which was presented i
last week and which bore the signatures of j
between 400 and 500 business firms and j
persons roughly estimated. This petition j
was referred one week ago yesterday to j
the Committee on Legislation, of which
Supervisor Britt is cnairman. The com
mittee yesterday reported the preamble
and resolution, which mean so much, and
the report was adopted without delay.
Immediately after this a motion to ad- ;
journ was made and carried.
Mayor Phelan looked surprised and ex
pressed freely freely.
"I am greatly astonished," he said,
"that there was no debate. I had ex
pected that there would be some debate
on that report."
Supervisor Britt, who stood near, said: i
"We all thought that it was a good thing j
and so we passed it."
Mayor Phelan called for the petition
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
WILL NOT CLOSE
Many Teachers Willing to
Donate Their Ser
vices.
A Generous Offer Will Be Made
to the Board of Edu
cation.
All Agree That a Prolonged Vacation
Would Rain the Discipline
for Some Time.
The public schools must not be closed
for all that the Board of Education states
that there is not sufficient money to pay
the teachers for the full twelve months,
and that retrenchment of at least one
month's salary is necessary. Such is the
edict that ha 3 gone forth from quite a
number of public school teachers of this
City. It must not be understood by this
that they assume to dictate to the board,
but rather desire to keep the schools run
ning at their own expense, if necessary,
and trust to the public's sense of justice
in the matter of the payment of salaries
by and by.
When it became known that there would
be a deficiency in the fund from which
they receive their pay and that the mid
summer vacation would be likely to last
ten weeks instead of six, the teachers in
several, and probably many, of the schools
began to do a little thinking on their own
account as to how it could be pre
vented. At last a plan was sug
gested which they believed would be
accepted even though it meant much
Belf-Â»acrifice and, perhaps, hardships on
their part. Who originated the idea or
how it started is not known, but the plan
is this: That the public schools should
be kept open during the month in
question and that the teachers will give
their services gratis if necessary; but,
trusting that the Supervisors in time
will make a special appropriation for the
services performed. As stated the idea
met with favor in general, but still there
are those who have no desire to labor for
nothing and others who believe that
under the law their salaries will go on
whether the schools are closed or remain

which had led to the renort and the im
mediate action of the Supervisors, ana
scanned the signatures to the petition.
The preamble and resolution reported
and adopted are as follows:
WHKKEAS, The citizens and taxpay- j
en of this City and County have filed I
with the clerk of tfcis board a petition j
requesting that a resolution be adopted !
memorializing the present Legislature j
to pass a law eiving power to the Board
of Supervisors of the City and County
to submit to the citizens a proposition
to issue bonds for the payment of out
standing indebtedness and for the in
auguration of a complete sewer system ;
therefore,
RESOLVED, That this board requests
the present representatives of this City
and County both in the Assembly and
Senate to use their efforts in the direc
tion of having an act passed to enable
the board to submit to the taxpayers of
this Ci(y and County a proposition to j
issue 4 per cent bonds to run forty
years to enable this municipality to
complete a sewer system compatible
with its growth and needs and to clear
itself of a just indebtedness which was
contracted in the legitimate pursuit of
its business.
Supervisor Rottanzi said last evening
that he thought that there could be no
serious objection to ttie resolution. The
purpose of passing it was to secure some
action on tne part of the present Legis
lature rather than to wait two years.
When the Supervisors are enabled to pro
ceed they enn go ahead whenever the
time arrives for such action.
The language with which the resolution
concludes, '"to clear itself (the City and
County) of a just indebtedness which
was contracted in the legitimate pursuit
of its business," while it is a little in
definite may be held to apply to the set
tlement oi something like $200,000
worth of indebtedness for supplies
and stores furnished to the City,
which were never paid for because
they were in excess of the appropriations
for the years in which the debts were con
tracted.
Mayor Phelan and ex-Mayor Sutro were
interviewed last eveuing concerning the
bond proposition.
Mayor Phelan said : "The action of the
board in the matter of asking authority
to issue bonds for a sewer system and to i
pay the City's creditors was hasty. Prom- I
inent firms petitioned for this at the last
meeting, and as it was referred to a spe
cial committee â the Committee on Legisla
tion â it was lost sight of and was brought
up at the last minute out oi order. The
report should have gone in with other re
open, and that they can legally collect for
the iull twelve months.
Those who are most earnegt in the plan
suireesied state ihat patriotism and the
love of their profession are not the least
j important features of the movement. Be-
I sides, to have such a long enforced vaca
! tion would do much to destroy the dis-
I cipline of the schools. Among those
foremost in the movement is A. L. Mann,
principal of the Denman School, and he is |
ab!y supported by the vice-principal, Mrs.
E. M. Baumeardner. When the Board oi !
Education meets to-day they will present
the following communication:
Sax Francisco, Jan. 26, 1897.
To the Hon. Board of Edtication â Uentlemen:
The teachers of the Deuman School respect
fully request your honorable body Dot to close
the public schools of the City and County of
San Francisco for a month, or any length of
time on account of a shortage oi funds. We
think that it would be a great injury to the
pupils under our charge to omit any portion of
the studies or discipline for the scholastic
year.
As to compensation for our services, if you
should be compelled to withnold any part of
our annual salary we are quite confident that
the people of this City, acting through you
and the Honorable Board of Supervisors, as
they have frequently done on similar occa
sions of this kind, will take care that our past
dues shall be fully repaid in the shortest time
possible.
Quite a number of the fifteen teachers
in that school will sign the communica
tion, but Mr. Mann stated that he wasjnot
in a position to speak for all, as he bad
not been able to discuss the subject with
every one. In speaking of the situation
he said: "We have been through this
â  same thing before and we have never
lost very much. We need not fear in this
instance, for the people, the press and the
I politicians will not see tne teachers loae a
dollar. Furthermore, I will say for my
self and my vice-principal that we have a
sincere feeline that we would rather teach )
for a month for nothing than see the j
schools close â for the children's sake and '
for the honor of the profession.' 1
Professor Charles Murphy, the head of
j the department oi political science 1 at the
; Polytechnic High School, said :
"The suggestion I would make to ex
tricate ourselves from the difficulty would
be to continue the schools and let the
teachers wait for their salaries, even if
they had to depend on the liberality of
the Board of Supervisors in the tax levy
for the next fical year.
"The closing of the schools will not
remedy the evil. It in doing a great in
justice to bar the doors at a critical period
during the latter half of the school year.
From conversations with numerous teach
ers lam of the opinion that a very large
majority favor the continuance of the
work even at the sacrifice of their salaries,
as has been the case in the past"
Similar views are entertained by Miss
Pbelomena Nolan, the principal oi the
Washington Night School. She has dis
cussed tne situation with the teachers of
that school, and says they agree to the
proposition. As many of the pupils who
attend that institution are children who I
labor in the daytime, adults wno are en
devoring to secure an education, and many
people of foreign birth, the confusion of a
long enforced vacation would do more
harm than can be estimated.
W. N. Bush, principal of the Polytech
nic High School, spoke of the matter in a
rather conservative manner. He said
that if the other teachers are required to
donate their services tor a month he would
do likewise, but he is of the opinion that
it is a case of law and not contribution.
If he understands the situation the teach
ers are engaged for twelve months, vaca
tion or no vacation, and that if there is no
money in the regular fund for their pay
ment they will be paid out of the first ac
cumulation in the Treasurer's general
fund.
Miss Georjsie Morse is emphatically op
posed to giving her services for nothing
and said: "Why should I? Who will pay
my board bill while I am performing a
service for the people? We are obliged to
iireÃS, buy shoes, gloves and pay carfare.
But few teachers have been able to save
much money for a rainy day, and those
who have not saved will be obliged to
borrow money at 3 per cent interest while
working for nothing. If it is 'close the
schools or work for charity* I prefer to
close the schools so that I can go to the
country, where livine is cheaper and
where one can wear out some of one's old
dresses." Miss Morse said several other
equally breezy things relative to a big city
getting into such a tix as to make such
affairs possible, but added in conclusion
that if the City would promise to pay
some time she would be willing to work,
even if she had to borrow money and
stand the interest herself.

ports, and the resolution should have
come up later, when it would not have
been unexpected.
"Its object now is, I think, to sound
public opinion. It mentions no amount,
because, I suppose, there is no data before
the board concerning the cost of a sewer
system. The way to proceed is to first
ascertain, by a commission of engineers,
what the City wants and then provide for
it. lam now in consultation with an emi
nent engineer, and have, learned the
methods of otbercities.
"Granted that our sewer system is seri
ously defective, of which we have abun
dant evidence in Grunsky's and Manaon's
reports, we want a scientific plan, and
then decide to build a large section of it
yearly, either out of the tax levy or by
bonds.
"Until the magnitude of the work is
known, I would not decide which metood
is the better. The City Hall, now practi
cally completed, will require no future
levy, and so the builuing of sewers, alter
a comprehensive plan, might take its
place, and $250,000 on $300,000 annually
might be appropriated lor this purpose.
New sewers are urgent. They are not so
urgent, however, but that such an outlay
will not suffice for construction, as lar as
I can see, at the present time. Or perhaps
a comparatively small bond issue, to
gether with an annual levy, might be best.
It all depends on the magnitude of the
work, its urgency and cost. I will care
fully inquire into these matters and ad
vise the board, which will, 1 am sure, act
with care and deliberation when their
vole carries with it the expenditure of
public moneys."
Ex-Mayor Sutro said: "I do not think
that it is wise to proceed until this matter
is discussed publicly and the people have a
chance to reach a conclusion. lam in
favor of paying up the indebtedness of
the City. The goods were furnished and
the debt is justly due. The debt ought to
be paid out, of the regular income. It is
not exactly legal, but the honor of the
City and County is concerned.
"There is no doubt that a sewer system
is necessary, but Ido not think that it is
wise to attempt so large a work in a time
oi financial depression, when we do not
know what is ahead of us. We should
wait. lam of the % ouinion that the first
step to be taken should be the appoint
ment of a commission, to be composed of
competent engineers, to make plans and
give an estimate of the probable cost.
"There are things absolutely necessary
for our welfare. We need a sewer system,
but we also need a water works system, to
betwned by the City and County. If we are
to incur a bonded indebtedness we should
have the sewer system and the City and
County's water system included, and the
bond issue should be sufficient to provide
for both of these large enterprises.
"At this time the City is in a wretched
financial condition. We should not go
ahead until we have absolute security that
the money will be actually expended eco
nomically for the purpose in view. The
commission should be appointed to con
sider bota the sewer and the water works
systems. I think that we could well wait
two years with advantage. If we have
lived so long with our present sewers we
can live a little longer. I would suggest
a commissiou to include Professor George
Davidson, Colonel Mendell and Mr. Grun
sky or Mr. Manson. Such a commission
would not entail heavy cost for tlaefr ser
vices.
"We should have our whole plan well
in hand before we proceed. Ihere will
be no risk in bonding if the thing is prop
erly done and at the right time. But we
must have a perfect system before we
start. In two years we may be prepared
to go on."
siderationof the finances of the School De
partment, has reached practically the
same conclusion as Chairman Waller of
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Education. He said yesterday that theie
will be an actual deficit amounting to
$71,055 24 at the end of the present month.
He submits the following figures to
demonstrate what the actual fact is: â¢
Overdrafts for six months $18,873 85,
bills on hand not audited $17,959 12, esii
ruated teachers' salaries $74 000, estimated
office and shop expenses $5.")82 50. Tnis
makes up a total of $116,415 47.
Tne estimated overdralt on January 31 is
estimated at $33,084 14, and there is also
due half the salaries for November, 1896,
amounting to $37,973 10.

THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.
What a Prominent Merchant Thinks of
the Coming Convention.
L H. Morse of the King-Morse Com
pany, who returned last week from the
East, in speakinz of the Christian En
deavor convention to be held in this City
next July, said:
Yes, the Christian Endeavor convention ia
going to be a great thing for California. All
through the East, wherever I went, I found
the people tain ing about it and planning tor
it. i visited Chicago, New York, Boston, Ixjw
ell, Mass., Pittsburg. New Orleans, Indianapo
lis and a number of smaller places. Every
where I weat I took occasion to introduce my
self as a Califirulan and to speak a word of
invitation to the convention. What I had to
say was everywhere received with the greatest
interest, find I found the peopleâ especially
the young peopleâ eager to learn more about
our Golden West. I think we will have a big
crowd out here next July.
The American Bark Snow & Burgess Making Port Last Sunday. The Gracie S Put a Pilot Aboard When Off the Farallones
and a Few Minutes Before the Tug Active Took Her in Tow. The Snow & Burgess Left Australia a Day Later
Than the Swanhilda.
DETECTIVES ARE
STILL HOPEFUL
No Sign of the Swanhilda,
but She Is Hourly
Expected.
The Captain of the Snow and
Burgess Looks for Her
Next Week.
Remarkable Experience of a Water-
Front Expressman Last
Week
Every vessel that is siehted from Point
Lobos nowadays is at once set down as the
long-looked-for Swanhilda. Towboatmen
and ship-owners look for her either to
night or to-morrow. Should she not put
in an appearance during that time, then
they say she will not get in for a week.
Their opinion is based on the reports of
the barks Andrew Welch and Snow and
Burgess. "There must have been heavy
westerly weather outside," said Captain
Marshall of the tug Active yesterday.
"There was a heavy westerly swell rolling
in last Sunday, while the wind was from
the northwest. Both the Andrew Welch
and Snow and Burgess reported westerly
weather, and it should bring the Swan
hilda in to-night or to-morrow if she is
anywhere in the vicinity of San Francisco.
The Snow and Burgess took a different
course altogether from that taken by the
Swanhilda. He stood away to the west
ward and came up around the Marshall
group. The other vessel was spoken in
the vicinity of the Fiji group by the
Taupo, and must thus be taking the same
course as the Morialta, that was 70 days
gettine here from Newcastle. If the four
master reported by the Australia is any
where in the vicinity she should be along
inside of 12 hours."
The report of the Snow and Burgess will
make interesting reading for nautical men
who are figuring upon the arrival of the
Swanhilda. It is as follows:
Sailed from Sydney, N. S. \V., November 25.
Had northeast to north-northeast wind trie
first four days out, with line weather; then
had easterly and southeasterly winds from
light to brisk. Crossed the 180 th meridian,
in latitude 27 deg. south, thirteen days out.
Got the southeast trades in latitude 23 deg.
south, longitude 177 dee. west, which were
moderate to iresh, but lost them in latitude
10 deg. south, longitude 172 west. Then we
had calms, baffling, squally winds and much
rain. The weather was very sultry and warm.
Got the northwest monsoons in latitude 9
deg. 30 mm. south, longitude 171 de?. west,
which carried us to latitude 6 deg. south,
longitude 162 deg. west, where we got the
northeast trades. Crossed the equator in lon
gitude 163 deg. 30 mm. west, thirty-five days
out. Lost the northeast trades in latitude 23
deg. north, longitudo 167 deg. 30 mm. west,
and then we had southerly to south westerly
breezes, with occasional rain and hard squalls.
On Sunday, January 17, we lost the fore and
main topgallant sails in a hard squall in lati
tude 35 deg. north, longitude 146 west. In
fact, it has been very squally for .some time,
and we bursted several sails after we left the
northeast trades. Then we had south to south
east wind and misty, rainy weather to within
fifty miles of San Francisco.
If the Swanhilda struck the same winds
and encountered the same conditions as
the Snow and Burpess she should be along
here any time. If she struck the calms
encountered by the Morialta around the
Fiji islands she will not be herefor a week.

Jerry Sullivan, the well-known water
front expressman, had an experience the
other night that he is not likely to forget
in a harry. It was past midnight and
very dark and cold. The horse and wagon
had been put up hours before and Jerry
was sleeping the sleep of the just. He
was aroused by s <me one thumping on
the stable door, and when Jerry put his
head out of the window upstairs he
learned that the man who was making all
the noise had been directed to his place
and wanted him to go out to Hegger'ty's
saloon on the ocean beach and brine in a
trunk. He ofrered to pay well for the job
and Sullivan finally agreed to go. He went
out alone and secured the trrfhk, but on
his way beck got lost in the park and al
most ran over two men who were fighting
in one of the side walks. One of the men
ran toward the beach and the other man.
pulling a gun, betran to fire and yell at
him to stop. Jerry's horse took
fright and ran away, and when he
finally reached the Baker-street en
trance the man who had done the firing
was waiting for him. He asked a number
of questions, and ended up by letting
Jerry go with a warning never to mix
himself up in a scrimmage again, "lie
dad," said Jerry at parting, "it was you'se
that mixed me up. Sure an' I was the
innocent victim. Didn't my horse run
away, and haven't the trees scraped half a
gallon of paint off the wag n."
||Jerry finally reached the water front
again and after stabling the horse carried
the trunk up to his room. Next morning
the stranger came along and had jrith him
a large valise. He paid the expressman
well and said he would take the contents
of the trunk along with him. Jerry
offered to help, but the man said
"no," and going into the room
slammed the door in Sullivan's face. Ke
was inside about ten minutes and then
came out, saying he would call for the
trunk in a week. The next day he was
back again and got the expressman to
take the trunk to the Oakland ferry. That
was the last seen of him, but ever since
Jerry has been wondering what was in
that* trunk. He cannot understand why
it was necessary to go and bring it in from
the Cliff House in such a hurry and why
the contents should be taten away at onÂ«
time and the trunk at another. It may
nave been opium, stolen property ora
dead body: and says Jerry: "Bedad I d
give a week's wages just to know what the
thing really held."
Charles Denker, a stevedore in the em
ploy of Chase & Co., was badly injured on
the steamer Progreao yesterday. A coal
bucket fell on him. breaking his jaw and
shoulder-blade and also several of his ribs.
He was removed to the German Hospital.
The sealing schooners LuJsu D and Kate
and Ann were reported yesterday by the
steamer Arcata. The former had 126 and
the latter 90 skins when spoken.
Sixty-three days out is the record of the
Swanhilda this morning. When the ship
arrived at Newcastle from Cape Town she
was fifty days on the passage, which is
ordinarily made in ten days' less time.
Her hull was foul, as she had not been on
a drydock or cieaned for a long time, and
this was the reason given by the agents
for a loss of 25 per cent of speed between
the two ports.
The Swanbilda has not been cleaned
and is sailing between two ports on a pas
sage that consumes aa average of bO days.
If she loses 25 per cent from the foul con
dition of the bottom she will be out close
on to 75 days. The prospect of ten more
days' watch for Butler is not very alluring
to the detectives who pace Meiggs wharf
day and night, and the lookouts on the
tugs anb pilot-boats, but the watch will
go on till the big four-master shows her
royal trucks above the horizon.
To-day Detective Roche will arrive
from Washington by the overland. He
will go directly to the office of Captain
Lees, thence down to Meiggs wharf, where
he will take his place in the watching and
waiting for the Swanhilda.

RIVAL EDITORS
FIGHT A DRAW
The Outcome of the Trouble
Between T. E. Flynn
and J. H. Barry.
A Blackthorn Cane Figures as
the Weapon in the Early
Morning Contest.
Confl cting Statements as to the Part
of the Principals â Bail Deposited
by E ich for Appearance.
The contest which has been waged in
the editorial columns of the Wasp and the
Star by Thomas E. Flynn and James H.
Barry yesterÂ«iay resulted in a battle be
tween the rival editors. They met near
the corner of Montgomery and Sacramento
streets and there was a brief and decisive
struggle, and then Edward F. Leonard,
the officer on the beat, took both to the
California-street station. There they put
up $10 each for their a!>pearance to-day.
At the station their clothing was shown
to be marked with Montgomery-street
m.ud.
Said Mr. Barry in regard to the circum
stances of the fight:
"I had just got off the Sacramento
street car at the corner of Montgomery
and was on the way to my office when a
slight breeze seemed to lift my hat off my
head. I turned round to recover it and
confronted Tom Flynn in the act of rais
ing a heavy blackthorn cane to strike.
"I immediately grappled with him and
a struggle ensued. I got hold of bis right
wrist so he coula not use the cane and we
wrestled till we approached the edge of
tbe sidewalk, when I threw him into the
gutter. I was then on top and bad pos
session of the car.c.
'Turther proceedings were stopped by
the arrival of an officer. That is all there
is to it.
"The evening papers contain a state
ment that I was struct fonr times. It is
untrue. I was not even scratched. As
exhibit A in this case l speak for myself."
Mr. Flynn said: "This originated
through a criticism I made at the time of
the appointment of the committee to go
to Washington in connection with the
railroad. Barry was put on the commit
tee along with George K. Fitch and James
D. Phelan, and I said he waa not a repre
sentative man and shouldn't be put on it;
that he only discredited it. Barry began
at once to say all kinds of false things
about me and lasc week he was particu
larly offensive.
"This morning I was walking up Sac
ramento street and he was comin â¢ down
on the dummy of a Sacramento-street car.
As I sawhim I bailed him, but he paid no
attention to it. He rode on till he got
about twenty yards from the crossing,
when he jumped off and walked very
quicltly toward his office. I followed him
up rapidly, and as he was going around
the corner 1 grabbed him by the shoulder.
"Then I asked rum why he bad been
printing such scandalous stnff about me
as had recently appeared. He said some
thing about printing what he pleased, and
would give no satisfaction. 1 had a cane
and I gave him a blow on the Â«ide of the
face, and directly I gave him another one
on the other side. He was dazed and con
tinued to grab for the stick. I hit him
about four blows. I kept backing off, so
as to get the use of the stick, and in doing
so I slipped from the curb and went down,
and pulled him down on topof me. That's
about the amount of it. I expected when
I saw him to five him a couple of good
whacks with the stick and end it at that."

in which were attractive booths where
refreshments, such as lemonades, punches
and cigar*, could be obtained. These

dancing. The best people of the City were
represented. Mrs. C. J. Field, the presi
dent, and Mrs. J. K. Firth, the secretary
