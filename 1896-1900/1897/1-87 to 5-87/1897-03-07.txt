another step in behall of the Turks, ana
fuel has thereby been added to the in

British Consul here, to Candimo?, whither
he proceeds with the ostensible object of
rescuing the besieged Moslems.
The Consul is on board the Rodney. It
is thought that the real object in landing
the foreign force is to compel the insurg
ents to raise the siege of Candimos, if
necessary.
Candimos is among the mountains,
seven miles inland. ; It is reliably stated
that there are 9000 Mussulmans in the
town, and that their situation is very
grave. The insurgents' guns are destroy
ing the works, which the Turks are gal
lastly defending.
A number of combatants on both sides I
have been killed, including some of the
leaders. \
The 500 foreign Bailors and marines
have been landed, and will start at once ',

NEW YORK, N. T.. March 6.â A cable
dispatch was received by D. N. Boiassi,
the Greek Consul-General in .New York,
this morning from M. bkouzes. the Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, say;ng thai Greece
had calied on the reserves of the classes of
1886, 18b7, 1868, 1869, 1870. 1871, 1872 and

is instructed to give immediate informa
tion to all the Consuls of Greece in the
United States and expects them to do
their duty. Ail the Greek citizens of this

to-day. There are 20,000 Greeks in this
country, of whom about one-fourth are

this mandate carries punishment of two
years' imprisonment and a tine.
Consul Botassi said the cablegram was
of a most alarming nature and war
seemed imminent.
"It is very serious," said Mr. Botassi.
"I am instructed to even call out the re
serves^ that belong to the classes as iar
back as 1866, and so it is evident that King
George sorely needs the support of every
able-bodied Greek in his struggle. The
men whom this call affects are only too
willing to go if they can only afford tne
cost of the journey. The Government haa
no appropriation for the transportation
of the reserve?- I receive daily hundreds
cf offers from patriots who remember the
days of Marathon and whose lives are at
their King's service. Considerably over
100 have left already and many more are
preparing to join their respective regi
ments."
"I very much fear," continued Mr.
Botassi, "that on Monday war will be de
clared. King George has been given
until noon on ihat day to declare his in
tentions, and I feel almost certain from
the tone ot dispatcnes I have recently re
ceived that King George's answer will be
the brave, defiant answer that Greece" has
always given to her enemies, whether they
be great or small. In the name of King
George I wish to officially notify all
Grecian reserves who are in this country
that their fatherland calls them back to
the ranks, and to all. Greeks, whether they
hive fought in bygone days or whether
they have not, in the name of my king
"your country wants you."

BERLIN, Germany. March 6.â The
authorities of the Foreign Office here con
tinue to express confidence in the ultimate
submission oi Greece to the demands of
the powers for the withdrawal of the Greek
fleet and troops from Crete, though the
King and Government of Greece, for rea
sons of domestic policy, may go to the
most extreme vergÂ» of war with Turkey
before complying with the requirements
of the powers' demand. The latest official
advices from Athens point, to the certain,
fact that the foreign representatives will
leave the Greek capital on Tuesday if the
reply of the Government of Greece to the
ultimatum of the powers is unsatisfac-
tory.
The tenor of the reply of Greece to the
demands of the powers is already fcnpwn
from the personal communications of
Premier Deiyannis to the foreign Minis
ters and an answer will be substantially
that Greece declines to withdraw her
troops from Crete altogether, but will
offer to station them in certain districts
of the island, provided the Turkisn troops
be confined to c?rtain other sections,
while the Cretans shall bo allowed the
freedom to vote upon the question wheth
er the island shall be annexed to Greece or
placed under an autonomous adminis
tration.
This plan is known to have the approval
of France, Italy and Great Britain, but
theatitude of Austria is doubtful. The
Kaiser and the Czar, however, will be cer
tain to reject this method of settlement
and will insist that a complete evacuation
of the island by Greece must be prelimi
nary to further negotiations.
The terms of the reply will lead to a
prolonged exchange of communications
between the powers and cause a cessation
of action in the meantime.
If as the result of communication be
tween the powers the blockade of the
Piraeus should be enforced, there in still,
however, a prospect of a settlement of Ihe
trouble without resort to arms. It is re
c.tlled how events developed in 1886, when
Greece made a claim toa section of Mace
donia to balance the acquisition of East
ern Roumama by Bulgaria. Greece at
tnat time mobilized and massed troops on
the frontier and had several encounters
with the Turks. The powers presented
Greec? with an ultimatum and demanded
her disarmament. After a delay of a
week Greece answered the ultimatum, and
SENATOR MORGAN of Alabama Says That Congress Will in the Near Future

the reply being inadequate the Ministers
left Athens and the powers blockaded the
Greek ports.
The Delyannis Ministry, which was then
in power in Greece, resigned, and after a
diplomatic struggle lasting a month, the
King, with a provision*.! Government, gave
way to the inevitable. This is a matter ot
history which is likely to be repeated.
Nevertheless Serviaand Bulgaria are mak
ing every preparation for possible eventu
alities. Since King Alexander of Ssrvia
returned to Belgrade from h is visit to Sofia,
orders have been issued by the Servian
Minister of War, General Miskovitch, for
an immediate re-enforcement of the Ser
vian troops on the southern frontier. Bul

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6.â The
Call correspondent, by appointment witu
Senator Morgan of Alabama, met this dis
tinguished gentleman at his residence to
night, and was accorded an interview with
him on the subject of the proposed Nica
ragua canal. Senator Morgan, like all of
his colleagues, is much fatigued after bia
all-night vigils in the Senate chamber
during the closing days of the fifty-fourth
Congress, but when his favorite topic was
proposed he entered willingly and ear
nestly into a thorough discussion of the
subject.
At first Senator Morean (being politi
cally opposed to the administration now
in power) disclaimed any knowledge of
what its policy might be, but before the
close of the interview he expressed the
opinion that no action would be taken
during the extra session of Congress,

My little boy was afflicted with Eczema In
acute form for nearly a year, during â which
time we tried without success every known
remedy. The disorder appeared on the right
cheek and was of a blistery and bloody form.
His pillow, mornings, would bear the bloody
imprint of the side of his face, while it was
impossible to prevent the little fellow from
scratching his face, owing to the intensity of
the itching. I was advised to try Cuticuka.
The first application was made before putting
the child to bed, and the appearance of the
affected parts showed a noticeable improve-
ment the next morning. As a result of the con-
tinued use of Cuticura my child has as fair
and smooth skin as can be found anywhere.

Kiniey promulgated 10-day is to meet on
March 15. Senator Morgan said:
"I would much rather not give any ex
pression of my opinion as to the bill's
chances at the present time, for really
there is little that I cnrÂ» say. The new ad
ministration bas only been installed two
days, and therefore has had no time to an
nounce its foreign or domestic policy.
Certainly I, as one of opposite political
faith, have no means of knowing what its
policy will be as regards the building of
the canal. In a few days, or as soon as th*
new President has had time to familiarize
himself with the duties of his office and
has had time to consult witn his official
advisers (his Cabinet officers), I expect to
have a long talk concerning the canal.
Until then I will be unable to form any
definite opinion as to the chances of my
bill. I will say, however, that I beiieve
that the new administration will favor the
project. â¢
"The new Secretary of State, Mr. Sher
man, served for many years on the Senate
committee with me and I know his policy
very well. He favor* my bill, for he bas
reported it to the Senate twice. It is true
Mr. fcherman has in times past changed
his policy with respect to legi-iation pend
ing before Congress, but I have no reason
to believe that he will be inconsistent in
this regard. I feel quite sure the canal
bill will pass. If we cannot get it through
at the extra session our efforts will be
renewed next winter. Until I have talked
with the Dowers that be I will be unaDle
to express any positive opinion as to the
bill's chance? at the extra session. lam
rathei incline.] to believe, however, that
President McKinley ana Speaker Reed
when they met yesterday concluded it
would be wise anJ expedient from a politi
cal po.nt of view to attempt no legislation
at ttie extra session beyond the passage of
a tariff bill and of the appropriation bills
that failed by reason of the veto or non
signature of President Cleveland."
The Call representative sugeested to
Senator Morgan that during a recent inter
view with Speaker Reed the latter stated
to the correspondent that the state of the
Nation's finances would not warrant ex
travagant appropriations for public build
ings or for any otuer public works, be
cause the Wilson tariff biil aid not pro
vide adequate revenue, and for the same
reason Mr. Reed as a member of the Com
mittee on Rules had refused to set a day
for ccn-idp-ration of the N caraguan canal
bill. The Call correspondent then asked
Senator Morgan, "Do you think it possible
that after a new tariff bill has been passed
Bpoater Reed will be willing that Congress
should expend money for needed public
improvements, including the canal's con
struction?"
. Senator Morgan seemed half inclined to
resent the imputation of the Repub ican
party that the Wilson bill had failed to
provide sufficient revenue, but wisely con
cluded not to defend this measure, but to
shoulder the responsibility upon the Su
preme Court of the United States, which
had nullified the income tax. He ex
pressed his conviction that the time would
come when this court's personnel would
be so changed that the constitutionality
of an income tax measure would be cou
lirmed.
Senator Morgan thought that perhaps
Attorney-General McKenna would suc
ceed Justice Field on the Supreme Court
bench and was anxious to know what view
Mr. McKenna might entertain as to the
constitutionality of an income tax. He
peemed very much interested in Judge
MiKenna, particularly as he had heard
that Judge McKenna had been appointed
a United States Circuit Judge chiefly
through the influence of Senator Stanford.
Morgan's interest in the matter is only
natural, since the Pacific Railroad force
closure suits are to be prosecuted by At
torney-General McKenna.
Returning to the canal topic, Senator
Morgan gave ex-President Cleve and a
roasting for issuing millions of dollars'
worth cf bonds for the profit of a syndi
cate of bankers when half of that money
would have built the Nicaragua canal, the
construction of which would be of incalcul
able benefit to the woild and* especia'ly to
the United States in time of war and in
time of peace. "No wonder the whole
world regards our policy with amaze
ment," said Morgan.
The Senator further expressed the opin
ion that Cleveland had studiously, stub
bornly and jealously opposed every one of
the foreign policies which liad prevailed
during the administration of his prede
cessor, Mr. Harrison.
"The people of the United States," he
said, "are learning more every day about
the incalculable advantages that wou.d
accrue lrom the canal's construction, both
from a commercial and patriotic point of
view. The time is not far distant when
there will t be such a demand for the cÂ«nal
from all sections of the country that the
people's servants in Congress will not
dare to longer disregard that demand.
"The people of California and the Pacific
Coast are naturally most to be benefited,
for they will be relieved of the monopoly
and tyranny of the Pacific railroads. It
is therefore only natural that they should
take the lead in the canal matter. The
Californians are people of indomitable
energy and enterprise, and friends of the
canal biil expect them to continue their
efforts, which have been so valuable to us
heretofore. 1 firmly believe that by per
sistent and united efforts we will be at
last successful in build ing a waterway that
will be the grandest artery of commerce in
the world, of inestimable benefit to the
commercial population of our country,
and in time of war o." advantage that can
not bo calculate I in dollars."

ORGANIZATION OF
THE NEW SENATE
A Matter of Some Concern
to the Republican
Caucus.
Uncertainty as to the Seating
of Oregon and Kentucky
Appointees.
Hints That All Other Parties May
Combine to Capture the Com
mittees
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6.-The
first caucus of the Senate of the Fifty-fifth
Congress was held this afternoon. It was
not productive of result?. After a discus
sion of one hour and a half, during which
Senator Allison of lowa was made the
caucus chairman and Senator Wilson of
Washington re-elected caucus secretary,
a resolution was adopted authorizing the
chairman to appoint a committee of
seven, of which he himself is to be the
head. This committee is to be known as
the committee on the situation.
The discussion this afternoon, while
larsely informal in character, developed
the fact that the Republicans are not
agreed as to where they stand or how they
will stand when the membership of the
Senate is completed by the election of
Senators in Oregon and Kentucky to fill
existing vacancies.
Senator Aldrich, a member of the steer
ing committee of the last Senate, started
the discussion with the statement that
the caucus should decide whether it
should at this time appoint a committee
to nil the vacancies in the Senate commit
tees, or whether it should appoint a politi
cal committee similar to the steering com
mittee of last session.
Senator Aldrich, who had given the sit
uation in the Senate very careful consid
eration, was inclined to go slow, and sug
gested that it would be wise for the
Republicans to know their strength be
fore asserting it. This suggestion ap
peared to meet with the commendation of
the other leaders in the Senate.
Senator Proctor said there could be no
doubt that the Republicans would have a
majority in the Senate with the vote of
the Vice-President. He asserted that a
Republican would be sent from eacn of
tne Stales of Oregon and Kentucky.
Inasmuch as this makes but a total of
forty-four votes, and as forty-five are
necessary to lie the Senate on a lull vote,
Proctor was asked where he proposed to
get that one vote.
Proctor evaded the question and the
conversation became general.
It is said that no names were mentioned,
but tbe intimation was very sir. nsly con
veyed that Kyle would supply that vote.
Kyle is the Populist recently re-elected
from South Dakota â¢Dy the s lia Repub
lican vote after the greater part of his own
par-y Lai forsaken him. bhoud he vote
with the Republicans and should they get
the two votes irom Kentucky and Oregon,
Vii-e-Presiden t Hobart would be in a posi
tion to cast the deciding vote on ail con
tested questions.
The action of Governor Bradley of Ken
tucky in appointing Mr. Wood to succeed
Blackburn was commented upon. It was
conceded that this appointment would be
contested and that the credentials of Mr.
Wood would be sent to ti.e Committee on
Privileges and Election*, where a light
against him would be inaugurated.
Tbe resolution of the (Senate in the Man
tle case was also referred to and the pre
diction made that Mr. Wood would hardly
be permitted to take his seat.
Senator Hoar took tbe ground that the
Kentucky case was controlled by the de
cision in the Blair and Bell cases from
New Hampshire, a decision which, he ob
served parenthetically, ought to have been
respected in consideration 01 the Mantie
case. For this reason it was believed by
many that no Senator from Kentucky
would be permitted to take bis seat until
he whs elected by the Legislature.
The Oregon case also came in for some
discussion, Senator Proctor making tbe
statement that the Governor of tnat State
would also appoint a Senator.
In view of ail these facts, it was agreed
that it would be the rart of wi-dom to
move slowly, and a resolution offered by
Cullom, and modified at the suggestion of
Hoar, was agreed to, providing for the
committee heretofore indicated. This
committee will confer with the Demo
cratic leaders in an endeavor to ascertain
the "situation," and will report to another
caucus wh eh will be held Tuesday.
Senator Platt of Connecticut suggested
that the conditions in tbe Senate were
such that a political advisory committee
was absolutely essential, and, temporarily
at least, the dvii s of the old steering com
mittee will be performed by tbe committee
which Allison is authorized to appoint.
Plait's suggestion iloubtless grew out of
the minor that has been going the rounds
for several days that the Democrats, both
sound money imd silver, ir.tend to com
bine with tbe silver Republicans and Pop
ulists in an attempt to capture the com
mittees ana organizations of the Senate.
Tuis alleged combination was not referred
to this afternoon in specific language, but
was ninted at in tbe numerous references
to "existing conditions" and phrases of
similar import.
Tne tariff was mentioned bnt incident
ally. No uneasiness was manifested on

that score and the statompnt was made
that there w> v d be no sprious opposition
to the pas a,'e of a tariff bill constructed
by Repub. icans after a reasonable time
had been given to debate.
No otner questions were discussed. The
sneakers were: Senators Frye, Hale,
Pritchard, Hoar, Cullom, Chandler, Piatt
of Connecticut and Carter. The latter
gentleman gave every evidence of working
in perf- ct harmony with bis Republican
associates, regardless of his predilection
for silver. He advised the caucus that
ih re was no need to hurry in this matter,
ana suegested, as had several others, that
belter results might be obtained by first
ascertaining what the exact situation in
the Senate was.
Platt of New York did not attend.
Hanna and Foraker of Ohio were present,
and participated in the i roceedings only
as intensely interested spectators. Neither
of them addressed tin* caucus.
It is probable that after Allison's com
mittee have had a conference with the
Democratic steering committee, a Demo
cratic caucus will I c called.

LEGISLATION FOR
THE WATER FRONT
Assemblyman Pohlman Is
Working to Secure Im
provements.
Proposed Issuance of Bonds ior
the Extension of the
Seawall.
East Street Should Also Be Put in
Conditicn to Moke It a Credit
to the City.
SACRAMENTO, Cat,., March I.â Gus
Pohlman, chairman of the Assembly Com
mittee on Commerce and Navigation, re
ports that the committee has about fin
ished its work.
"Among some of the bills considered by
the committee," said Poulman to a Call
reporter this morning, "is the measure to
transfer to the San Francisco harbor fund
$43,125. This amount is over and above
the sum allowed the depot fund and has
I been in the State treasury for some years
: past an 1 could nof be used for any pur-
I pose under the law. By the adoption of
this bill the Harbor Commissioners can
be enabled to make vast improvements on
the water front.
" 'Bond bill, 1 or bill 472, relating to the
irnprovement*of the water front, is a mat
ter that I have been required to explain to
many inquirers. To repair the wharves,
including the placing of new piles, re
plutikin_-, etc., will cost no small amount
Assemblyman Gustave Pohlman*
and it will be a question of only a very
short time when the same work will have
to be gone over again.
"There is urgent necessity for the con
tinuation of the seawall to the south. By
the terms of this bill bonds are to be issued
for $1,000,000, payable in twenty years. Ie
woula not only be an enduring improve
ment to the harbor but a source of reve
nue as well.
"After the bill shall have been approved
by the Governor the voters will be given
an opportunity to vote for the bonds at
the next election.
"I believe in good roads and a good
water front," added Pohlman. "During
my residence in San Francisco, for the
past forty-four years, I can look back and
recall many of the old-time wharves, the
dangerous mantraps and the inconvenient
landings. East street should be of uni
form width and reDaved in order to com
plete the work and make the water front
a matter of priue to us."

Governor - Budd'* Appointment* Con*
firmedâ So Camp Sites â >o Orereoati.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 6.â Some
time ago the announcement was made
that Governor Budd did not intend
to send to the Senate any of
the appointments he had made
in the National Guard for fear that
they would not be confirmed, and that to
overcome this he intended to allow the
appointments to expire and that he wouli
re-appoint toe nominees after the adjourn
ment of the Legislature. This woul<l hare
affecte i the division comraanler, General
Jamas, Brigadier-Goneral Warneld and
many others.
At a late day the Governor did send in
the names of the individuals appcinied
by him and they were all confirmed on
Friday.
Another matter which interested the
National Guard wa* the question oi camp
sites and military camp 3. Senator Dck
mson was the father of a measure for the
appropriation of $40,000 f r the purchase
of two sites. In me Senate this provision
was killed, as wis also the provision for
< vercoats for the guard, the latter on the
ground of economy.
Senator Dickinson pave notice of re
consideration in th j matter of camp sites
and if that fails he will try to have an ap
propriaiion of $40000 passed for expense*
of military canj|<s during the next two
years. There have not been any such
camp 3 for three ypars.

England Anxiout to Extend the lime
to Greece.
LONDON, Eng.. March 6.â There still
does not seem lo be complete accord
among the powers, especially in the case
of Great Britain, as to when the final
steps shall be taken to coerce Greece into
complying with the demands that have
en made upon her by what i* called
"United Europe." So far as foreign af
fairs co, trie so-termed Infallible British
Prime Minister seems to be in doubt as to
the outcome of his vigorous policy, which
has called forth heartfelt condemnation
by many English newspapers, and it is
said that he will propose to the other
powers that before blockading the coast of
Greece that country be given an extension
ot time in which to consider her re
eponse to the collective note demanding
her withdrawal from Crete.
Indecision is generally a sign of weak
ness, and it is so believe I In this case to
be. It is thought that Greece does not
need ar.y farther time to consider what
reply s c will make to the powers. 6mall
and weak as she is it is judged from the
dispatches irom Athens tnat she is thor
oughly determined to maintain her pres
ent attitude and defy the powers to do
their worst.
In the meantime the admirals com
manding the foreign fleets off Crete have
been ordered to report a plan for the
blockade of the Greek coast, and this in
the face of the menacing position evi
denced by the mobilization of the Greek
army and a report that a squadron has
started for the ccast of Macedonia.
A re&orter of the United Associated
Presses was told at the Foreign Office to
day that the officials there still had confi
dence that there would be no armed colli
sion between Greece and the powers, and
if the statements attribute-d to the Greek
Prime Minister, M. Delyannis, be true it
is evident that the Foreign Office officials
are viewing the situation with an optim
ism that is not warranted by the facts.
Though the current of British sentiment
flows strongly in favor of Greece in the
Cretan imbroglio, it is apparently not
strong enough to direct the policy of Lord
Salisbury. He may pretend to bow to the
popular will, but really he is taking Ms
own course, acting on the dictum of Lord
Beacoustield that diplomacy must be
guided by statesmen and not by the
"chatter of irresponsible frivolity."
Following the iuea that the Govern
ment's foreign policy, right or wrong,
should have the support of the country,
some of the Liberal papers are discovering
that something can ue said of diplomatic
action which, though contrary to general
sentiment, is, in official opinion, keeping
Europe out of war, an opinion which it is
leared will shortly rece vo a sudden
shock. The Gladstone, Labouchere and
general Liberal comention that Crete
ought to be united with Greece has led to
some public enlightenment on the exact
j :stice of the Greek claims, the position
of King George toward certain of the pow
ers and what might be the results of union
upon Crete.
It has transpired that King George since
his settlement on the throne has been
drawing annually from England. France
and Russia a pen-ion of Â£12.000, each
power giving him Â£4000 per annum upon
the understamlin that that sum shall
continue during the good behavior of him
self and subjects. There are those who
look upon the Greco-Cretan trouble as a
prearranged scheme to save the King
and his dynasty from a revolution, which
would embarrass the King and his guar
antors.
Anent the Greek claims, racial and re
ligious, there are now voices beard pro
testing that the modern Greek is the
merest mongrel making fraudulent use of
tradition, a most indifferent Christian,
and wanting Crete for the purpose* of rob
bery. It certainly can, be affirmed with
accuracy that the people of ;he lonian
Islands ceded to Greece through Gladstone
regret the change lroni prosperity and no
taxation under Britain to diminished
trade and heavy imposts under Greece.
A letter issued by ihe Geographical
Commercial Society of Paris from a Syria
correspondent declares that t c Cretans
distrust Greece, ant want autonomy.
Under tho Turklne CreÂ»an Christian have
been exempt from military service, paid
with much irregularity their imposts and
have long bad a quasi independence. An
nexed to Greece they would be liable to
military duty, be burdened with taxation
and a mob of Greek functionaries to rule
over them and collect the taxes. This is
of course ex pane evidence, and it does
not in any way agree with the statements
of the leaderÃ of the Cretin in-urgents,
who declare that they will fight to the
death to free themselves from every sem
blance of Turkish rule and who protest
that they desire annexation to Greece.
Probably Lord Salisbury and other
European diplomats care little for the cry
of Crete foi the Cretans. But it is obvious
that autonomy similar to that of the
island of Samos would commend Itself to
state-men. Samos has a purely Christi n
population and so differs from Crete,
which has about one-fourth Moslems.
Samos, be it noted, though entirely Greek,
has refused to become a part of Greece,
preferring autonomy with an annual
tribu c oi 300.000 piastres to the Suitan to
being ruled by Christians of the same
race.

As a Measure of Decency and for the Protection of
Public Morals the Portland Library Asso
ciation Expunges the "Examiner"
From Its Files.
PORTLAND, Or., March 6.â At a special meeting of the board of trustees of the Portland Library
Association, comprising some of the most intelligent and influential men here, a resolution was adopted
expunging the San Francisco Examiner from the files of the library. This resolution was somewhat of a
surprise to a comparatively small number of the members, but it was brought about by the earnest
solicitation of the majority of the patrons of the library, the younger members of whose families spend
much of their time there.
A Call correspondent interviewed several of the trustees with respect to the proscription of the
Examiner, and as to whether there was any very recent cause for their action. All of them state that
they rarely saw a copy of that journal, but the frequent critical reference by the reputable press of the
Pacific Coast to its pandering to indecent and corrupting sensationalism prompted them to investigate the
moral tone of that paper with the aforementioned result.
"We would just as readily allow the young people visiting the library to revel in the nastiness of
the Police Gazette as have them perusing the columns of the Examiner as it is now coeducted," remarked
one of the trustees. "That paper to-day is doing more harm," continued he, "in corrupting young minds
than any of the weekly publications prohibited from entering the homes of persons making any pretension
to respectability or decency. 1 must say that our board has been very derelict in its duty in not earlier
causing the removal of the Examiner from the files of the library. I cannot understand how any moral
community can long tolerate such a crime-encouraging and morality-destroying sheet as the Examiner. Its
ghastly illustrations alone are sufficient to condemn and cause its exclusion from decent homes, as if it were,
what it really is, a thing unclean. Then, the graphic and ghoulish manner in which it publishes the in
decencies of its own City and elsewhere, which, if necessary to appear as news matter, should be dis
missed with a few obscure lines of reference, shocks one possessed of any refined sensibilities. In my
opinion it may not be long ere the Examiner shall be refused transmission through the mails."
Another trustee stated his reason for voting for the adoption of the resolution as being the repug
lance he has for the so-called new sensational newspaper. "It fails to fill the mission of legitimate journal
ism to educate the people and chronicle current events in a pure, incorruptible style, and its tendencies are
for no moral good. Although we have been somewhat tardy in removing this San Francisco sheet from the
library where our young people had easy access to it, I opine that our course will have the effect of greatly
diminishing its circulation in private houses here, where its influence to degeneracy may produce irremedi
able harm in future," added this trustee.
The action of the Portland Library people is discussed everywhere, and scarcely an expression of
condemnation is heard.

Managing Faker Hides May

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 6.â Wine-
Ing under the probe that has discovered
to the world its utter shameleÃsness and
malignancy, that galled jade, the mon
arch of the "new journal" fakers, now
prates of its honor, and seeks to hide its
dearth of facts behind a virtue in which
us poverty is equally great.
Acting under instructions, the only
member of the Examiner staff' who ad
mitted to haying any knowledge of the
data on which the bribery faKe article was
based, refused yesterday to divulge such
information, its sources, or anything that
would give the investigating committee a
tangible clew to work upon. His excuse
ifor his obdurate course was that his honor
was involved, as to give the Legislature
the information which it asked would ne-
Vossitatate a violation of confidence and a
breach of his word of nonor.
This peculiar attitude is viewed with
â¢corn and ridicule. Attention is directed
to the puerile character of such an ex
cuse, which is presented to shield the
honor of one individual, when that same
person has been guilty ol not only im
pugning the honor and integrity of nearly
eiehty legislators, but by his present
course in presumably preventing the ex
posure of a most serious crime and the
punishment of the criminals.
Viewing the matter in this light, there is
a positive conviction, not merely a senti
ment or opinion, on the part of every one
familiar with the subject, that the Ex
aminer article was a fake; that it was
known to be a fake when published and
that the fake was published for an object,
and that in order to avoid being publicly
branded as a self-confessed faker it was
willing to make maityrs of members of
the reportonal staff.
This idea tnat it had an object in seeking
to bring about the defeat of Assembly bill
No. 273 by the publication of its fare
bribery article was apparently confirmed
by the statement made by Frank Moifitt
in the interview published in The Call
this morning to the effect that he had de
clared that Andy Lawrence, managing
i editor of tbe Examiner, was interested In
line Hale & Norcross judgment.
I While little regret is expressed over the
predicament in which the managing edi
tor of the Examiner has involved himself,
sympathy is felt by many of the Legisla
tors for his subordinates, and more par
ticularly for "Blinker" Murphy, who, it
now appears, has also made himself liable
to imprisonment, for contempt
During the Senate examination last
night Murphy wai asked by Senator
Morebouse: "Do you know of your own
knowledge of any communication relative
to this matter from the city of Sacramento
by any person connected with the Ex
aminer, either on Saturday of last weeu
or for a week or ten days preceding that
time?"
His reply was: "I do not think I can
answer that question unless Mr. Hearst
consents to my doing so."
Senator Morebouse stated to the com
mittee that he did not think this was a
proper ground for declining to answer, as
the matter in question was not a priv
ileged communication.
Chairman Dickinson directed the wit
ness to answer the question.
"I do not desire to be in contempt to
the committee," replied the witness, "bat
I shall have to decline to answer the ques
tion under the circumstances."
His further examination was abandoned
at this point, and it is understood that in
the resolution that will be introduced in
the Senate on Monday, three persons of
the Examiner staff will be called to the
bar of the Senate to purge themselves of
or be punished for contempt. These will
be Andy Lawrence, J. J. Levings and Al
Murphy.
So palpab'e has now become th; fake
character of the story published in the
Examiner of last Saturday that there is
talk about a combination between all the
maliened members of both branches of
the Legislature for the purpose of bring
ing libel suits against that journal, each
legislator to sue for $50,000.
Much mystery and capital has been
made by the faking newspaper out of the
telegrams which it stated had passed be
tween Senator Voorheis and certain prom-
inent people. It has tried to make it
appear that the Senator from Amador had
received telegrams from Charles F.
Crocker. Alvlnza Hayward and W. F.
Herrin in reference to the use of illegal
means to bring about tbe passage of As
sembly bill No. 273. Senator Voorheis
makes no secret about having received a
telegram from each of the individuals
named and of their contents, and is ready
to submit them to the committee when
ever its members call for them. The one
from Hayward asked Voorheis' support
for Senator Wolfe's bill relative to extend
ing the rights of corporations sole, a meas
ure in which Archbishop Riordan is
greatly interested.
That from Mr. Herrin was in reference to
the claim of the Southern Pacific Com
pany against the State for money due it,
according to a recent decision of the Su
preme Court of the United States, while
the dispatch from Colonel Crocker re
quested Senator- Voorheis to support the
University tax bill, tbe final passage of
which was a cause of rejoicing throughout
the State.
It was on chimeras like this that the
Examiner based its positive assertion that
"without a shadow of doubt* members of
the Legislature had been bribed. To-day
it aeain snarled and snapped at every one
who it found would not stand aside and
permit it to go nnwhipped of justice. But
itsjnaundenngs are now only laughed at.
Its fangs have been drawn and its venom
is innocuous.
Its attacks are now courted as the highest
commendation. Its reputation as a faker
is now as fixed and unchangeable as the
star Sirius in the firmament. If it has
friends to reward it must condemn them
in its choicest billing-gate, and if it has
enemies to punish it need only laud them
to the skies.
At the executive session of tbe Assem
bly bribery investigation to-day it was de
cided to defer action in the matter of con
tempt on the part of Andy M. Lawrence
and L. L. Levings so as to srive tbe Senate
an opportunity to deal with the recalci
trant witnesses.
Should that body not decide to imprison
the witnesses for their contempt if they
continue obdurate the Assembly will press
the matter to such a conclusion, as that
body is determined to make tbe Examiner
prove its positive charges or admit that
the whole fabric of its article was, as
Attorney Knight virtually admitted last
night, composed "at an idle moment in
idle rumor and street talk" when the
writer was "filled with good gin cock
tails."
Attorneys Knight. Clunie and McEner
ney this evening served tne following
paper upon Chairman Dickinson of the
Senate investigating committee:
In response to the understanding between
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
ourselves and the committee last night we
have to request that you issue the following
subpenas: To Frank Jaynes, superintendent
Western Union Telegraph Company, requiring
him to appear before the committee on Mon
day, March 8, 1897, and bring with him all
telegrams under his control tliat within sixty
days last past have beeu transmitted over the
wires of the Western Union lelegraph Com
pany and addressed by Senator E. C. Voorheis
from Sacramento to AWinza Hayward at San
Francisco or San Mateo, to Colonel C. F.
Crocker at San Francisco, to George W. Baker
at San Francisco or Oakland, or to W. F. Her
rin at San Francisco; and also to bring with
him any telegrams ander his control that
have witnin sixty days last past been trans
mitted through the Western Union Company
to Senator E. C. Voorheis at Sacramento from
Alvinza Hay ward at San Francisco or San Ma
teo, George W. Baker at San Francisco or Oak
land, and from W. F. Herrin at San Francisco.
The document asks also for telegrams
from Hayward to Baker, from C. F.
CrocKer and from W. F. Herrin,
The counsel asfc for a second lubpena
requiring Jaynes to bring all telegrams
that have been sent or received at Sacra
mento between January 10 and February
27, inclusive, by Senators Androus, Bert,
Bulla, Chapman, Doty, Dwyer, Feeney,
Franck, Hall, Henderson, Langford, Lin
der, Mahoney. Morehouse, Pedlar, Prisk,
Seaweil, Shine, Stratton, Toner, Voorheis
and Wolfe and nfty-one Assemblymen.
The names given in the request are of
the Senators and Assemblymen who voted
for Caminetti's bill 273, but nothing is
said about the bill in the document. The
fact that the request for the suboena
does not state that the telegrams required
relate to that bill shows that the Exami
ner's attorneys are pJaying a game of
bluff.
They know that under the rule of evi

than 273 are not admissible in evidence,

a howl to the effect that the Senate de

Johntian Make* an Explanation to the
InveaUiatino Committee.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., March 6.â The
joint committee to investigate the affairs
of tne State Printer met this, afternoon,
with Senator Dickinson in the chair. 11.
T. Devlin appeared as the attorney for the
State Printer.
State Printer Johnstqn appeared before
the committee, and la reply to m question
as to whether there was a deficiency in the
State .Printing Office at the time of the in
troduction of A. B. 263, appropriating
$75,000, said that there was not.
All claims against his office, he said,
were passed upon by the State Board of
Examiners. It was his custom before the
bills went to the board to cneck them over
and ascertain whether they were correct.
In purchasing supplies for the printing
department it bad been his custom to ad
vertise for a period of thirty days for bids
as required by law.
A recess was taken until 8 o'clock this
evenine. Johnston, in reply to Assembly
man Caminetti's questions, said that the
first dispute between him and the Gover
nor occurred last July about the July pay
roll.
They had another difference about a
coal bill. It appeared that before the new
contract for coal had been entered into
the office eot out of coal and Johnston
bought seventy-five tons of coal under the
old but then existing contract at $10 per
ton. The price was 96 cents a ton higher
than the rate under the new contract
The coal had been ordered from ti:e con
tractor some time before.
Caminetti examined the witness very
closely on what kind of inks he bought
and where, but he made nothing out of
tnat, 8s all supplies for the Printing Of
fice were purchased by contract.
Senator Seawell took up the examina
tion at this point and went over the sta
tistics contained in the last biennial re
port of the State Printer. He asked John
ston concerning an^apparent shortage of
$51,000 and Johnston explained that that
was made up by $28,000 worth of legisla

John Skelton, a coal dealer, was asked
as to the manner in which he delivered
coal to the State Printing Office. .
Senator Dickinson said to Caminetti,
who was examining the coal-dealer, "If
you believe or even suspect that coal was
bought and paid for and was not deliv
ered, we will give you every opportunity
to ascertain tbat factâ we will give you
full scope."
Caminetti denied tbat he had such belief
or suspicion, but he asked whether Skel
ton could furnish the committee with a
statement of the quantity of coal deliv
ered by him and the weight of each load
delivered.
Skelton said he would be able to pro
duce the required statement by next
Wednesday.
Caminetti at this stage of the proceed
ings became a little irritable because of
a remark made by Dennery ana asked
tbe chairman to keep "that boy" quiet.
Dennery resented the remark and said
that if the chair would not protect him
from inanlt he would protect himself,
whereupon Senator Dickinson observed
that it the gentlemen desired to indulge
in personalities he would furnish them
with boxing-elovcs and a referee.
Skelton was ordered to produce the data
next Tuesday morning. The witness said
that he bought his coal from tbe Oregon
Improvement Company in San Francisco.
He declined to state what he paid for it.
Ten dollars for Brymbo coal was a fair
price.
J. Thorpe and other witnesses were ex
amined as to the manner in which orders
for printine were received and the general
routine of the work in the State Printing
Office. The Assembly will resume its in
vestigation at 10 o'clock to-morrow (Sun
day) morning.
SUAXAUAX LAUGHED AT.
Could Xot Defeat the Municipal Incor
poration Bill.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 6.â There
was a lively tight in the Assembly this
afternoon over Senate bill It, entitled
"An act to validate the organization and
incorporation of municipal corporations."
Tha act, if it becomes a law, will enable
the suburban town of Emeryville. Dear
Shell Mound Park, Oakland, to make its
own laws, just as any other town.
Shanahan made a violent attack upon
the bill. He said that it was in the mter
e-t of people who owned the racetrack at
Emeryville, ana he made a heated decla
mation to the effect thut the racetracks
were circles of science where men gambled
away their money and women lost their
honor, presumably by drinking wine be
tween the heats; but Bhanahan did not
explain in what way or to what extent
women who attend races lost their honor.
This violent attack was replied to by
Leavitt of Alameda, who remarked with
horn -miide sarcasm t!iat the gentleman
came from a county where there were no
racetracks, "and," he added, "I hope they
will never eet any racetracks up there
since they, send such people as he to the
Legislature. 1 '
Bettman explained the purpose of the
bill and read an editorial in The Call
advocating its passage. Ue denounced
the remarks of Suanahan as uncalled for
aud misleading. He explained that it
was a general law applicable to all the
towns in the State, and that there was no
valid reason why the bill should not be
come a law.
Dennery, shaking his hand in the direc
tion of the political orphan from Shasta,
remarked that the gentleman appeared
to have a bad attack of railroad on the
brain.
North of Alameda spoke in favor of tho
bill. It affected the incorporation of the
town of Â£meryville, which had been
already incorporated; the bill was a just
one and harmed no one, and he would
vote for its passage.
The bill waa finally passed by a vote of
49 to 21.
Shanahan changed his vote and an
nounced that on Monday he would give
notice of a motion to reconsider.
Hat* of Adjournment.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 6.â The

a Woman's Peculiar
Fad.
Mrs. Calvin of San Francisco
Loses Her Incisors Set
With Diamonds.
Is Chloroformed by the Culprits, Who
Then Use a Pair of Den
tist's Forceps.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 6.â Mrs. Cal
vin, whose husband is engaged in the
commission business in San Francisco,
came to Portland to visit her sister about
four weeks ago. This week she uncere
moniously took her departure for home,
which fact caused considerable surprise
among her acquaintances nere. Repeated
inquiries as to her action brought to light
the details of a most daring and peculiar
robbery.
Mrs. Calvin, who is a handsome woman,
became a few years ago a victim of a fad
that prevailed at that time. She had two
Valuable diamonds set in her upper front
teeth, so that when she parted lips in a
smile the sparkling gems shone resplen
dently. Her peculiar adornment at
tracted considerable attention while here,
for it was something out of the ordinary.
Mrs. Calvin was alone in her sister's
bouse last Monday afternoon when the
doorbell rang. She answered the sum
mons and admitted two men, who claimed
they were plumbers sent by the owner to
inspect the house. Mrs. Calvin was lead
ing tbem to the kitchen, and when in the
dining-room they seized her, placed a
chloroformed handkerchief to her nose
and rendered her unconscious. Then
with forceps they extracted the two teeth
in which the diamonds were set and left
the place.
Mrs. Calvin recovered and summoned
assistance, but refused to allow the police
authorities to take charge of the matter,
objecting to the notoriety. The following
evening she Ooarded a train for San Fran
cisco.

Mrs. White was in Mountain View
shopping yesterday and appeared to be in

afternoon anl shortly afterward fell to
tne floor in a fainting condition. There
was no one in the house but four small
children, and they put a Dillow under
their mother's head ana covered her with
some bedclothes. She appeared to be
asleep, so the eldest child put the others
to bed and watched by her mother. The
little watcher at length retired, thinking
her mother would be all right in the
morning.
When she awoke this morninÃ her
mother was still lying in the same po
sition. She tried to arouse her and found
her dead.
Neighbors were notified and the Coroner
summoned. Coroner Secord held an ln
â quest this afternoon. Death resulted from
heart trouble.
The deceased was the wife of Thomas A.
White, chief of the railway mail service
Detween San Francisco and Ogden. He
was telegraphed to at the latter place to

Mountain View for many years and was
about 35 years of age. She leaves four
children, the eldest of which is about 10
years of age.

FRESNO JURORS DISAGREE.
County Officials Again Fail io Convict a
Chinese Lottery Proprie
tor.
FRESNO, Cal., March 6.â The difficul
ties which beset the officers of Fresno in
trying to put a stop to the Chinese lot
teries which are running in full blast in
Chinatown were again demonstrated to
day in the trial of Ah Lee, a Mongol
charged with soiling tickets. The guilt
of tne defendant was conclusively proven,
but his attorneys succeeded in arousinc
the prejudices of six of the jurors to such
an extent that they voted for acquittal.
Ah Lee was represented by three of the
best attorneys in tne city. Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Jones conducted a very
vigorous prosecution. The District At
torney's office has always worked hard to
suppress the lotteries, but has always had
its purposes defeated by the strange con
duct of jurors.
Some of the acquitting jurors in to-day's
case are known to have been loudest in
criticism of tne officers for not putting a
stop to the lotteries.
Two witnesses swore to-day that tbey
went to Ah Lee's place in Chinatown and
each bought a ticket from him. Deputy
Constable Crutcher testified that wlien he
arrested the defendant the latter pleaded.
"Don't arrest me; I sold those two tick
ets," practically confessing his guilt. The
officer also seized a complete outfit for the
Belling and marking of tickets, which he
found Ah Lee presiding over when he
served the warrant. The officer took pos
session of a spindle hoUUng duplicates of
the tickets Lee had sold for the next draw
ing. There were also several books of
blank tickets.
AH this paraphernalia was shown to the
jury. The defense offered no testimony
and Lee's attorneys contented themselves
witu arguing before the jury. They
owelt at length upon the fact that the
otner big lotteries, such as the Honduras,
were allowed to sell tickets throughout
the country without molestation. The
lawyers cleverly urged that the Chinese
were being persecuted. This was their
only defense. The jury was out for an
hour and a half, at the end of which
period it returned to court and announced
its inability to agree, standing six for ac
quittal and six for conviction. Justice
Sl John then discharged the jury.
SAN DIEGO TRAGEDY.

Cuts His Throat With a
Razor.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 6.â Charles

LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 6. -Last
summer when the Democratic Convention
deadlock in tne contest between Qeorge S.
Patton and L. J. Rose for the Congres
sional nomination ended in tne with
drawal of the principals there was none
so eloquent in behalf of any candidate as
was J. Marion Brooks in urging upon the
assembled faithful the name of Obarles A.
Barlow. Barlow had been nominated by
the Populists at San Luis Obispo a few
days prior to the Democratic Convention
in this city. Brooks cbampioned Barlow's
fight in tho Democratic Convention, and
in a speech of great fervor elaborated on
the wisdom of breaking the deadlock by
indorsing the "Farmer Statesman." The
convention did not agree with Brooks, but
instead nominated Harry Patton. The
latter was afterward relegated and Barlow
was substituted on ihe Democratic ticket.
His election by a small majority followed.
Brooks worked early and late ior "Hon
est Charley" Barlow, and now Brooks it
suing Barlow for $4000.
Brooks filed bis suit here this afternoon.
He alleges that during the past two years
he has loaned Barlow various sums aggre
gating $2000, and has also given him ad
vice and rendered him other valuable ser
vices worth $2000 more. He, therefore,
asks judgment against the Congressman
for $4000.
LI ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS.
Supreme Court Decides an Appealed Case
Against a Kansas Rat way
Company.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 6.â An im
portant decision nas been rendered by the
Supreme Court of this State in the case of
William Ferguson, plaintiff and respond
ent, vs. M. H. Sherman, the Electric Rapid
Transit Company et al., defendants and
appellants, the opinion reaching the Los
Angeles office for tiling to-day.
The appeal was from the judgment and
order denying a new trial. The plaintiff
pleaded that the defendant, the Electric
Rapid Transit Company, was a corpora
tion, organized under the laws of Kansas.
He alleged that a judgment had been ob
tained in tbe United States Circuit Court
for the District of Kansas for $7717 50 and
costs; that he caused execution to be
issued out of the court to be levied upon
the property of the company, which was
returned wholly unsatisfied! Then fol
lowed an averment that under the con
stitution and laws of Kansas in such a
case execution mÂ»y be issued against any
of the stockholders to an extent equal in
amount to the amount of stock by him
owned, together with any amount unpaid.
The defendants, other than the company,
were sued as stockholders.
The action, then, says the Supreme
Court, is an effort upon the part of the
judgment creditor of the Kansas corpora
tion to enforce against California stock
holders tneir statutory liability for the
judgment's debt. Appellants' contention
was that all of the provisions of the Kan
sas law contemplate special statutory rem
edies given by the laws af another State,
and not consonant with the laws and pro
cedure of this State, and that ?uch liability
cannot be enforced in this action.
After an elaborate discussion of the
points raised ihe Supreme Court holds
that the decision of the lower court, hold
ing the stockholders liable, was correct,
and the judgment and order is affirmed:

STEEL MILL TO REOPEN.
Wheels of a Los Angeles Plant Will Soon
Turn Again After Months of
Idleness.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 6.â The
Los Angeles Iron and Steel Mill is to re
sume operations on a greater scale than
ever. Several months ago this concern's
failure was the one topic of interest in
business circles. The mill was built two
years ago at a cost of $150,000. It employed
eighty men and did a profitable business
until the steel billet and rail pool caused
trouble last summer.
Strenuous efforts are now being made to
put the mill in operation again. The steel
billet pool burst, and with the prospect
of railway connection with Salt Lake and
a speedy construction of a deep-sea harbor
the steel men are gaining courage.
It is planned to build an addition to the
present plant, to be used in the making of
steel billets, which have Hitherto been im
ported. This addition would cost $30,000.
Local capitalists are becoming interested,
and it may not be long until the smoke
again issues from the chimneys of the big
rolling-mill on Mateo street.

how serious the defeat was.
In spite of the art of snatching victory
from defeat, in wnich the Spanish official
reporta so greatly excel, General Vara del
Rey is obliged to confess his disaster,
though finding an excuse in the superior
numbers of the Cubans and the advantage
of their position.
In his report, known at Manzanillo,
though probably it will not be published
in Havana, he says that his column was
only 1500 men strong and estimates the
Cubans at over 3000.
The Spanish dead, he says, were 500,
and he adds, that notwithstanding he was
obliged to retire the losses of the insur
gents were also severe.
The batile turned against the Spaniards
when General Vara del Rey tried to cross
on his way to Manzanillo the river Buey
notwithstanding the heavy fire from the
Cuban rifles and two cannon, one a 12
--pounder, wnich caused terrible slaughter.
While crossing the river all was disorder
and confusion among the Spaniards, and
he could not reply to the volleys of their
foes. Nearly all their horses were drowned
and they had to abandon the more im
portant part of the convoy they were es
corting.
A small bridge of wood of which they
availed themselves broke down, and with
it one of the Spanish cannon sank to the
bottom of the river. Other cannon were
left on the shore, and were captured by
the Cubans.
On the other side of the river General
Vara del Rey found another Cuban
column waiting for him. In the state of
panic and confusion in which his troops
had been reduced the Cubans were able to
complete their victory.
General Vara del Rey himself narrowly
escaped capture.
In tiiis situation the Spaniards decided
to abandon the remainder of the convoy,
which they succeeded in taking across the
river, and they hastened their march to
Manzanillo.
As the object of the Cubans wa3 to seize
the convoy, the fight ended there. It
lasted eight hours. The Spaniards took
two hours to cross the river, and they be
haved with great courage during all the
battle. Not a single Spanish soldier de
serted.
All who did not reach Manzanillo were
left, killed or wounded, on the field. The
battle was directed by General Calixto
in person, though the real success he ob
tained was in great part due to the skill
of his chief of staff, Colonel Mario
Menocal.
SAXGUILLX'S DKEP GBATITUDE.
Hardly Kealizet Thnt He It Again a
FraÂ« Man.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 6.-General
Julio Sanguilly, who was released recently
by the Spaniards nfter two years in Ca
banas fortress at Havana, arrived in this
city at 2 o'clock this afternoon. He was
met in Jersey City by 200 Cuban sympa
thizers, among whom were his brother,
Manuel Sanguilly, and Mrs. General Ca
lixto Garcia, wife of the famous Cuban
General. Sanguilly was accompanied by
his wife, his son and a niece, who came
with him from Havana. Mingled with the
cheers for Cuba libre and General San
guilly were cheers for General Fitzhugh
Lee.
Before proceeding uptown General San
gnilly, in answer to questions, said to the
reporters:
â¢'I can hardly realize that I am free and
â¢within arms' reach of my friends and re
latives. Two years is a long time in the
Cabanas, and to breathe the free air again
and to graip the hands of old friends is a
boon at one time I thought would never
come to me. To that brave soldier, Fitz
hugh Lee, and to the American people, it
would be impossible forme to express my
gratitude. My life belongs to them and
to him.
"After months of stone walls and
Spanish guards there seems to be a new
hope and new life in everything I feel or
hear or see."
'â¢Is it true that you have given up your
claim as an American citizen against the
crown of Spain as one of the conditions
upon which you were released?"
"There is not the slightest truth in such
a statement," lie replied. "I would not
give up the honor ol being an American
citizen for Spain. I know now too well
what it means to be under the protection
of the American flag. It i 3 too dear a
thins to renounce, even where one's life is
concerned. ''
"Regarding the Cnban cause, do you be
lieve the Cubans will eventually
triumph?"
"Absolutely," he replied. "In my
mind Cuba will be free within a year. All
we want and all we need is for the Unit^
States Government to allow us to lanl
armament and ammunition upon the
shores of Cuba. As soon as that is eranted
Spanish rule will cease and Cuba will see
her way clear to absolute independence."
When asked what the Cubans thought
of the attitude of ex-President Cleveland
on the Cuban question, he replied :
"They, of course, do not indorse the
President's attitude. The Cubans I
have recently met express great hope that
the new administration will deal indul
gently with the Cuban Republic. They
have a government, and they have shown
beyond a doubt that they are able to codo
successfully with the Spaniards. That
should give us a right as a Government, and
we expect President McKinley to do tnat
which ex-President Cleveland failed to
do â give the Cubans belligerent rights."

' HAVANA, Cuba, via Key West, Fla.,
March 6. â On the night of the 4th inst.,
about 6 o'clock, a band of Cuban
patriots entered the important town
of Guines, Havana province, and
with heavy discharges of mus&etry
forced the garrison to retreat into their
barracks and the forts surrounding the
town. After taking possession of the
sanie they overran the town, setting fire
to the houses. After accomplishing their
bold deed they quietly left the town.
In order to appreciate the importance of
the deed it is necessary to know that
Guines has a population now of 16,000
souls and the garrison exceeds 2000.
Yesterday the parties of Frederico Nunez
and Ernilio Loran, 200 men, "surprised
seventy laborers of the sngar estate

province, in the act of cutting cane. All
of them were held as prisoners for a couple
of hours and finally released after depriv

YACHT ROVER'S
PERILOUS TRIP
Disabled by an Unknown

Seekers' Thrilling Experience
oo the Water.
After a Wild and Exciting Race the
Vessel Is Run Upon tin B>ach
With Its Cab. us Flooded.
SAUBALITO, Cal., March 6.âCommo
dore Charles C. Bruce, owner of the swift
yacht Rover and one of the Trustees of the
town of Sausalito, had a thrilling and per
ilous experience in San Pablo Bay last
night, which would have terminated dis
astrously had not the commander of the
Rover been a careful mariner.
The commodore, who is well known in
yachting circles, being a member of a
couple of yachting cluba, invited a party
of five to spend a couple of days with him
on a cruise about the bay in the Rover,
Last night while sailing about San Pablo
Bay an unknown craft, which displayed
no lights, crashed into the yacht and stove
a hole in it, through which the water
rushed.
In a moment the greatest excitement
prevailed aboard and Commodore Bruce
was unable to ascertain what boat had
caused the collision. After causing the
damage the strange craft disappeared and
the Rover's crew at once set to work to
keep their yacht afloat. After repairing .
the damage as best the facilities would
allow Commodore Bruce determined to
make a bold attempt to reach Sausalito,
where he could beach the boat. He turned
it& head about, and then commenced a race
full of excitement.
Under the stiff breeze which was blow
ing the yacht, in its disabled condition,
made good time, but the water was slowly
rising in her cabin. Mr. Bruce, when
seen to-day, said that they had a fearful
tussle, and as evidence showed where his
hands were cut and bruised from his
labors to keep the yacht afloat.
Finally Sausalito was sighted and the
party gave a sigh of relief. Straight for
the lights on the waterfront the pretty
yacht was headed. The water had been
pouring in until it was waist deep, and
the commodore lost no time in sending
the boat upon the beach, and their danger
had passed. The party got ashore as soon
as possible. This afternoon the yacht was
bailed out and towed to its moorings near
the San Francisco Yacht Club house.
The damage to the yacht is not great,
but none of the party is desirous of re
peating the thrilling experience. Mr.
Bruce said this afternoon that he had not
learned what sort of a. craft bada enhed
into his boat, '

NEW YORK. N. V., March 6.â General
Sangailly and his. family were the guests
of honor to-night at the entertainment
given in aid of the Cuban hospital fund at
the Carnegie Lyceum.
He was too fatigued to speak In answer
to frequent and enthusiastic calls, but had
to shake hands with nearly a thousand
persons before the audience would let the
performance proceed.
The incident of the evening was the
meeting of General Sanguilly and Gen
eral Daniel E. Sickles in the letter's box.
. When the veterans shook hands the
audience cheered for Sanguilly, General
Sickles and Consul-General Lee, and the
performance stopped until the enthusiasm
subsided. The entertainment was a suc
cess in every way.

PORTLAND BANKER
BECOMES SENATOR
Henry W. Ccrbstt Named |
as the Successor of
Mitchell.
Appointed by the Governor After
the legislature's Failure
to Elect.
Is Prcmlnent in the Bus ; ness World j
and Sirved a Term in
Congress
PORTLAND, On, March 6 âln view ot
the failure of the recently adjourned i
Legislature to elect a successor to Senator
J. H. Mitchell, Governor Lord to-day ap
pointed Henry W. Gorbett, vice-president
of the First National Bank of this city, to
fill the vacancy.
Mr. Corbett was born in Westboro,
Mass., on February 18, 1827, and for more
than forty-live years he has been a con
spicuous man in the Northwest. He was
one of the first members sent from Oregon
to the upper house of Congress after this
State's aimissio.i.
In 1869 Mr. Corbett, in company with
Henry Failing, purchased a controlling
interest in the First National Bank of
Portland, an institution that had been es
tablished in this city four years previou*
to that time. Messrs. Corbett and Failing
became its financial head. This is today
the oldest and strongest National bank in
the Pac.fie Northwest. In addition to his
conneciion with this bans Mr. Corbett Is
interested in many other important busi
ness enterprises which have received and
are still receiving the benefit of his able
counsel and pecuniary assistance.
He has been a director of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company ; he is
largely interested in the Portland Cordage
Works; he is one of the leading stock
holders of the Portland Linseed Oil
Works; he is one of the leading owners of
Oregon Transfer stock; lie is vice-presi
dent and principal stockholder in the Ore
gon Fire and Marine Insurance Company;
he is president and one of the originators
of the Security Loan and Trust Company
and is largely interested in street railways
In this city. At the present time Mr. Cor
bett is president of the c mpany which
built and furnished the magnificent Hotel
Portland, second in size only to the Palace
Hotel of San Francisco. He has also been
prominently connected with the Board of
Immigration.
In private enterprises Mr. Corbett has
always responded liberally and wisely to
all calls for support or encouragement in
any form, and he enjoys a flattering repu
tation for liberality in the line of effective
beneficence. H- gave $36,000 toward the
erection of the First Presbyterian Church
in this city, and in addition he has made
liberal endowments to many of the char
itabe institutions of Portland.
In politics Air. Corbett was originally a
W'fiig and a devoted follower of Henry
Clay. Upon the formation of the Repub
lican party in Oregon he became one of its
leaders, ani as chairman of the Republi
can State Central Committee performed
valiant service toward securing the as
cendency of the grand old party in Ore
gon politics. Mr. Corbett's debates on
National finance and the funding bill
while he was in the United States Senate
are still cherished by his colleagues as
masterpieces of logic.
Mr. Corbett was an anti-Mitchell man.
He is perfectly eouhd on every plank in
ihe Republican platform ; he favors a gold
standard ; is enthusiastic in support of
the Nicaragua Canal project and believes
in the efficacy' of a reasonable tariff to
protect American industry.
SHE PULLED HIS BEARD.
Portland Lawyer Attacked by an Irate
Washerwoman on a Crowded
Street.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 6.â W. L. Nut
ting, a lawyer, who a few years ago en
joyed some prominence here in his protes
sion, figured in a sensational street episode
here to-day. On Yam hill and First
streets, a locality crowded on a pleasant
day, Mrs. Keppler, a poor but stalwart
laundress, encountered the lawyer and
began talking to him in a loud and in
timidating tone. This in a few moments
attracted a large crowd. Nutting, natur
ally of a retiring disposition, made an
effort to get away, but the laundress was
determined that the crowd should hear
her story of a long-standing unpaid wash
bill.
Eventually, when the lawyer could n o
longer stand the ridiculous position in
which he was placed, he made a deter
mined attempt, to leave the scene, but the
woman seized his very long benrd, jerking
it several times i<"> accentuate her closing
remarks. Mrs. Keppler vÃnished from
the scene just in time to miss the police
patrol-wagon.
Lawyer Nutting had a similar experi
ence with an iniuriated woman about two
years ago, but he did not con-ider it of
sufficient importance to cause her arrest.
It is also quite improbable that he will
prosecute Mrs. Keppler.
BETROTHBD FOR THIRTY YEARS.
Courtship Begun in Ireland Several Dsc-
ades Ago Ems in an Oregon
Wedding.
GERVAIS, Or., March 6.â David Barnes,
a well-known and fairly well-to-do citizen
of ibis place, a few days ago married the
woman to whom he plighted his troth in
Ireland thirty years ago. Her name was
Catherine Welch. Barnes regularly cor
j responded with her for twenty-six years,
' when he sud enly ceased writing. Why
j no one knew, for he was never known to
! pay attentions to any other woman since
he came to this part of the country. He
often spoke of the only woman he ever
loved, whom he left in the old country
during the heydey of his youth. Why he
! never sent for her remained an unex
| plained mystery to those in whom he con
fi led, because he- was well able to care for
a wife.
About ten days ago there arrived here
direct from Ireland a fine-looking woman,
who, after remaining in seclusion in a
' hotel for two days, visited Father Blan
! chet's church. Afier the service she mi
i formed, the divine that she was the woman
who, for almost a lifetime, had patiently
been waiting to become David Barnes'
' wife, and she complaintd because he tiad
; neglected her in the matter of correppond
| ence during the past four years. Father
j Blancliet well knew Barnes and he. ar
â¢ ranged a meeting between them. Barnes
I was not informed as to why the priest had
: *ent for him, but the moment be and Miss
: Welch saw each other there was a mutual
i recognition, despite the mauy years that
; passed since they met,
If the fire of love had ever smoldered in
j Barnes' heart since he ceased writing to
: his fiancee it blazed forth airesh on this oc
casion, and now they are a happy married
i couple.
DECREASING MARE ISLAND'S FORCE
Workmen Become Idle Because of the
Delay in Procuring Necessary
Material.
VALLEJO, Cal., March 6.â Eighty-five
mechanics and helpers were discharged
from the steam engineering department
this afternoon and it is expected that at
least as many more will be compelled to
pack up their tools and leave the station
within the next week. It is said that the
cause for this extensive decrease in the
force of workmen is that there is not
enough material on band to continue
work now well under way. The navy
yard officials are seriously handicapped
by the slowness with which the powers at
Washington distribute supplies and ma
terial. There is considerable work near
inc completion and an abundance of
money to carry it on, but the needed sup
plies in some departments are not yet In
sight.
Taltrjo Xmtimma Celrbrate.
VALLEJO, Cal., March 6.â Vallejo Par
lor No. 77, N. S. G. W., celebrated its
eleventh anniversary last evening with a
party at San Pablo Hall, which was at
tended by several hundred ladies and geu
tlemen as guests of the members. Vallejo
Parlor is one of the most prosperous in
hib section, with several thousand dollars
in its treasury and beinc governed by pro
gressive men.

day on the 17ih.
The "oldest inhabitants'' of Carson,
with their weather oracles, have lost their
jobs as prophets. When the big snow of a
fortnight ago tumbled upon us they
handed out chunks of consolation in the
shape of declarations that never before
did Carson weather behave in so recalci
trant a manner. This was the tirst winter
in years that the good people of Carson had
ever been given a chance to go tleieh
riaing, said these veteran wiseacres. But j
this year everything seems to be coming j
in a lump.
But the prophets are not to blame and
there is no help for the situation. It
might be worse, you know. Ihe snow is j
her-, and it is still snowing, and there I
may be snow on tne ground in large, fat |
layers np to the day of the battle which i^
agitating the v,-orid. It will in no wise
inconvenienice those who intend coming
here to occupy a seat in Dan Stuart's
mammoth arena. In fact it will be a nov
elty for thousands of them â that i?, the
thousands who are coming from sunc!ad
California. Tiie only anxiety being ex
perienced because of the climatic somer
sault belongs to those who are interested
in the training of Corbett and I'iizsim
mons.
The Cornishman as well as hi; trainers
declare solemnly that a little matter of a
foot or so oÂ» "the beautiful" will in no
wise handicap their operations, and to
prove that they were serious in what they
said the whole band of them slipped into
their Arctic shopp r.nd heavy clothing and
trudged for miles to-day over nature's
white carpet. But not so with Corbett.
Jim still sticks to bis theory that the ex
posure attendant upon tripping through
banks of snow is not worth the risk. His
greatest care all through bis training has
been to prevent contracting a cold or tak
ing even the slightest chance of incapaci- I
tatine himself for the event of his life.
His explanation is always the same â
wnether the trainer, newspaper corre
spondents or casual visitor â that he
wants to step into the ring a healthy,
whole mas, without an ache or an ail
ment and with no opportunity to offer an
excuse in the event of his defeat â an event
for the consummation of which the Cali
fornia gladiator can !Â»ee no possible chance.
"Now isn't this exasperating ?" said
Corbeti this aFtjernoon, as he impatiently
jammed his fists into hiÂ« trousers pocfcats
and walked over to a window of Shaw's
Hotel to peer into the storm. He could
see, through the founding cloud of whie
that was lazily settling toward the earth,
the indistinct outlines of his handball
court and the little sheds that surround
the main building at Shaw's Soring.
"This puts an end to my outdoor work,"
mused the big lellow. Jim was talking to
nobody in particular, po this is not exclu
sive. There were a dozen or more people
in the room at the time, but, strange to
Hf, none of tbe copyright sleuths.
"You don't mean to say that you in
tend to eive up road work^jntirely now?"
ventured one of t!ie company.
"Of course I do," replied Corb9tt, as if
surprised that anybody should ask such a
question.
"But what will your trainers say about
itf
"Let me tell you something," said the
man who lowered the famous John L.'s
colors, turning from the window and
dropping into a convenient chair. "My
trainers and I are in perfect harmony as
regards everything that takes place here
at the springs. They are guided more by
what I tell them as to bow I feel and whai
1 need than I am by what they might
choose to prescribe, although we never
have any clashes. I am the one who has
to fieht Fitz â not they. I knovr wnea I
am feeling right and what work is doing
me good. They consult me only on these
point 9 and offer advice. That has always
been my method of training, and inas
much as I have never iost a battle or even
been crowded in a contest, it must be a
pretty good method. Now, road work
is always beneficial and is particularly
good in the way of developing one's wind.
But there are other ways of reaching the
same end. My handball court is open
roofed, and in consequence I get all the
fresh air I need while doing my boxing
and handball playing, i will miss the
road racing, because 1 like it, but my hav
ing to drop it will in no wise be a handi
cap to my training. This snow may be a
good thing after all. My trainers have
now and then expressed a fear that I will
do too much work, and as this storm will
necessarily cut out a portion of the train
ing routine and reduce my work it may
be to my advantage. But, no matter what
any of us may think, the snow is here,
and no human power can prevent it, co
we will have to philosophically bow in
submission,"
View of the Completed Portion of the Coliseum at Carson, Showing the Ring in the Foreground.
It may be true, as James J. said in the
course of his remark?, that the fact that
i,is handball court is open roofed may he
a great advaniape in the way of admitting
fresh air, but it also showed itself to-day
to be something of a handicap. It let in
the ;-now. The floor of the court soon be
came white coated and treacherous:y
slipperyâ so much so that handball-play
ing waÂ» eliminated from the afternoon
programme. Jim played a couple ot
frames in the morning, but had to be de
cidedly gingerly about it for fear of sus
taining a fall that might be serious in its
results.
In the afternoon Trainer Billy Delaney
swept of the snow and after resining the
floor pronounced it >afa enough for a few
rounds of light boxing.
Despite Billy's carefulness the floor was
still in such a dangerous condition that
Corbett narrowly escaped meeting with
a:i injury that might have decided the
great championship battle in advance. It
was while he was having a bout with Big
Jack McVey, the wrestler, that the acci
dent occurred. Corbett confines himself
to clinching tactics when with McVey,
and he was carrying out his usual pro
gramme on this occasion. He has boring
into the big fellow and forcing him across
th? room when the champion's feet finally
leaclud a spot on the floor which was
caked with fleet. In an instant both legs
flew apart and Corbett partly did what is
known in acrobatic circles as the "split."
It is painful to those who do not prac
tice it and it hint Corbeti. He recovered
himself in a second, however, and again
plunged into McVey. But that prac
tically put an end to the afternoon's work,
as Trainer Charley "White, who bad be
come somewhat alarmed at the chances
Jim was taking on the slippery floor, soon
coaxed the champion to stop boxing for
the day and retire for a rub-down.
But .suppose we have something now
about Fitzsimmons, the "other fellow."
Bob's latest freak is a notion for handball.
Heretofore he has been inclined to sneer
at Coroett's penchant for this class of ex
ercise, but now he is going to be a crank
at the game himself.
He has started in to board up the in
terior of his gymnasium, assisting with
his own hands, and will have & very fair
court finished by Monday. His trainers
are groaning over the outlook, for they
can see only an increase in their labors
rather than the handball displaying any
other feature of the training bill.
When Fitzsimmons got out of bed this
morning he took a peep at the drifting
snow and wondered if the big man at
Shaws Springs was astir. Roeber and
Hickey took the Coruishtnan in charge
and marched him through the snow for
tweive miles '.his morning. They passed
the penitentiary at a gallop, came into
town through the slush and mud, and
peoule wondered at the daring of the
lanky fighter. On the way back to his
training quarters Bob stopped from time
to time and walked at a brisk gait with
Hickey.
Then they leaped into a gallop for 300
yards or more, and when they passed the
penitentiary, whic i is a stone structure of
strange design, they saluted the sentinels
on the turrets. It is only a half miie from
the prison to Fiizsimrnons' -headquarters.
He made this distance through the slush
ahead of Dan Hickey. and when he
knocked the snowballs. off his feet at his
training quarters he said :
"This is the worst game I've been
against yet. It's snowballs from break
fast to supper, but I'll bet five dollars to a
sausage that the other fellow has iiot
taken the run that I've made this niorn
inp. They say I'm not in condition and
that I'm not ready to right. You've seen
me in other rights and I think you know
that I've got something up my sleeve."
Fitzsimmons tneu entered his training
quarters and was stretched upon the
bench, where Roeber and Hickey rubbed
him Irom necK to ankles. As the giant
lay upon this couch he said:
"I've just got a letter from my wife, and
she tells me she ha* decorated our home
with crosses and evergreen. This good
woman," said Fitzsimmons, "has always
made this provision before a battle â that
is, before ray battles. I may be supersti
tious; I may be a crank; 1 may ba
'nutty,' as some people say, but somehow
or other I always sort of bank on the good
woman who has raised the cross .for my
victory."
It was then that big Roeber entered the
training quarters and began sprayrng
the legs of the athlete. Hickey wa- at his
throat with harsh towels and with a joke
now and then. When the big fellow had
been rubbed from head to loot he bei_an
ihe work of building a handball court in
side of " his gymnasium. Three men as
sisted him in this work. They were Roe
ber, Hickey and . Stelzner. Fiiz-umruons,
with his keen eyeâ and th* eye, by the
way, which has done some business in the
ring â cut the timber and placed all the
posts and boards in position. He seemnd
10 be as much interested in the construc
tion of the handball court as he would be
in a battle for the championship of the
I world. He watched every movement of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
the men ana to ona of the correspondents
said:
"I'm cut out for a carpenter as well as a
fighter. There's no chance for me to lose
this battle, but if I should, by hook or
crook, I think after the work of this after
noon I have demonstrated the fact that I
can build a structure at least."
After Fhzsimmons had finished his
work as architect within his own training
quarters he took a shotgun and, with
Stelzner, went into the mountains to hunt
some game. The two men started in a
bhnlmg snowstorm â a storm which has
raged for twenty-four hours â and after a
naif-hour's tramp through Rattlesnake
Canyon, they shot nine quail. Th'se Ne
vada birds are strange to Eastern sports
men, for the reason that they have a yellow
tail.
When Fitz returned to headquarters and
again stretched himself upon a couch in
the gymnasium he said:
"I am not like a whole lot of fighters.
Most of them say when they go into a
battle of this kind that it will be their
last. This is nonsense to me. Win or
lose, I'm going to keep on fighting, and
that I'm going to win I'm as certain of as
I am that St. Patrick's day comes on the
17th of March. I'm in a sort of peculiar
position. Many people, including those
who started to win my title to the cham
pionship, have said that I was drinking
liquor. Permit me to say to the people of
this country that I have taken only seven
drinks of whisky since I have been in
Carson. These were taken because of a
throat trouble and cold, which must peo
ple suffer from in this climate.
"I want to say to my friends in every
part of the country that I am the Fitzsira
mons who entered the ring in San Fran
cisco, at New Orleans and at Langtry. I
am making no boast that I will win this
fight. I know I'm up against a clever
man and a strong man, but I think with
the training I get and my own experience
as a general inside of the ropes that I will
outpoint him ana outpoint him hard.
Understand, this is no boast."
Fitzsinimons then arose from his couch
and, stretching his massive form, freckled
from head to tpe. and hairy from the neck
to the elbow, entered the gymnasium and
wrestled with Roeber.
Then he returned to his work of con
struction of his handball court inside the
building. He sawed most cf the timbers
and "bossed" the job from start to finish,
and when he was through with this work
he began to pluck the feathers from the
quail he had shot early in the afternoon
to the mountains.
The Cornishman considered that he
had only done a fair day's work, although
everybody else about the ranch was worn
out and longing for bedtime. This man is
a phenomenon and no mistake.
i'arson Davies, the celebrated Chicago
sport and manager of pugilistic stars, will
not be greeted with a hearty welcome by
the management of the comine carnival
in Carson in the event that he should
journey hither.
It appears that the "Parson" has given
it as his opinion that the big scrap be
tween Corbett and Fitzsimmons is to be a
fake, and this has greatly incensed Dan
Stuart. Through his secretary, W. K.
Whcelock, Stuart extended a formal in
vitation to-night to Davies to stay away
from the n ht. The Chicagoan is sar
castically informed that, inasmuch as he
knows so much about the outcome of the
mill, there would be no need of his going
to the expense and trouble of traveling
away out to Nevada to see it. The "Par
son's" reply to this joyous epistle ought
to be interesting. J. G. Mahsfikld.
SAN DIEGO PRIZE-FIGHT.
Gallagher and Weady Contest Be tore the
Silver Gate Club Declared
a Draw.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 6.â Eight
hundred people witnessed a ten-round
prize-ring contest at the San Diego Thea
ter to-night between "Billy" Gallagher of
Los Angeles and '"Jack" Weady of the
U. S. S. Monterey for the welter- weitht
cuampionshipof the Pacific Coast, a pnrse
of $300 and one-h:ilf of the gate receipts.
The right opened at 10:30 o'clock With
Charles Kaufman as refereÂ».
In the first two rounds Weady clinched
frequently io avoid punishment. At the
end of the third round he looked tired,
but h- walked up promptly at the call of
time and look a number of Gallagher's
heavy blows with a grit that surprised
every one.
Ifroru that time on both men rushed the
fighting, and in spite of Gallagher's supe
rior science, at the end of the tenth round
Weady had decidedly the best of the con
test, although the referee declared the
match a draw.
The affair was very successfully con
ducted throughout under the auspices of
the Silver Gate Athletic Club. Several
police officers were present, and perfect
order waa maintained.

ture went through the Assembly to-day.
It is as follows:
An act making the publication and editing

editors of the Territory; and whereas, the
nineteenth legislative Assembly of Arizona
views with alarm the encroachments. of the
capitalistic press, and has assumed the posi

lic morals; therefore
Be It enacted by the Nineteenth Legislative
Assembly of Arizona:
Section 1. That hereafter it shall be deemed
a felony to edit and publish a newspaper
within the Territory of Arizona.
Sec. 2. That the punishment for the crime
herein described shall be not less than ten
years' nor more than twenty years' imprison
ment In the penitentiary at Yuma.

herein described be and is hereby revoked and
annulled.
Sec. 4. This act shall take effect and be In

times and passed in fifteen minutes in the

Receives Many Messages
and Visitors.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 6.âPresi
dent McKiniey was at his desk at 9 o'clock
this morning and hard at work. His cor
respondence is accumulating rapidly.
Among the callers to-day were Senators
Allison and Gear of lowa. Pre-ident Me-
Kinley leceived hundreds of congratulat

them were the following:
H. H. Kohlsaat telegraphed from Chi
cago: "We salute you. Mr?. Kohlsaat
joins in heartiest congratulations to Mrs.
McKiniey and yourself. God bless and

The President and Mrs. McKin'ey were
pined at lunch by their relatives from
Canton, most of whom left for home this
evening.
Nearly all the receiving during the
afternoon took place upstairs in the Presi
dent's office. People came singly or in
delegations.
When a delegation arrived its members
would be corraled in the reception ball
and kept there until the President was
able to receive them. Then Secretary
Porter's messenger would throw open the
doors of Mr. Porter's room and announce:
"All who want to pay their respects to the
President step this way."
This waa the signal for a concerted
movement toward toe messencer, but he
would make everybo'vgpt in lino and
pass through to the President's office in
an orderly manner.
The President was in the best of humor.
His faculty of remembering faces and
names served him well, and sent many
people away smiling and happy. Colonel
Frea Grant of New York moved in and
out about the office rooms during the
afternoon.
About 4 o'clock he presented the mem
bers of the Riverside Republican Club of
the Twenty-first Assembly District, New
York, with the ladses who accompanied
uiern. Colonel Grant is said to be a can
didate for the office of Assistant Secretary
ot War.
A son of another former President also
paid his respects. It was Russell Har
rison of Indiana, who left for his home
to-niebt.
Vice- President Hobart dropped in for a
few moments during the afternoon.
Ladies accompanied the members of the
National Fremont Association, which was
headed by Major R. H. Long of Pittsburg,
founder of the association. Senators Car
ter and Mantle brought several Montana
ladies. Senator f iuuip led an Idaho dele
gation.
Among other callers were Bishop Arnett
of Onio, a prominent man in the Afro-
American Methodist Church; ex-Senator
Paddock of Nebraska; Charles Foster,
formeriy Secretary of the Treasury, and a
delegation Irom the convention ol the
Afro-American Editorial Association.
Shortly after 5 o'clock tne President
and Secretary Porter went out walking.
They passed out the east gate of the White
House grounds and walked eastward
along Pennsylvania avenue. Many peo
ple recognized the new President and he
was kept bunv doffing his hat.
To-night the President entertained a
number of intimatn and personal friends
at dinner. Most of those who were pres
ent went to the inaugural concert in the
Pension building later on.

CROOKS ESTATE IS
TO BE SETTLED
Important Suit for the
Partition of a Million
Dollars.
Real Property in All Parts oi
San Francisco Is to
Be Sold.
Heirs and Creditors Anxious to Re
ceira the Shares to Which They
Are En tit cd.
An important action at law for the set
tlement of the affairs of the weil-known
Crooks estate lias been begun in the
Superior Court by M. C. Hnssett, attorney
for Samuel R. Crooks, the amount in
volTed being nearly $1,000,000. It is in all
respects a friendly suit intended to deter
mine the rights of heirs and Claimants to
the Crooks estate.
Among the defendants named are: Jon
athan J. Crooks, Matthew J. Crooks, Rob
ert Lee Crooks, Margaret J. Morffew,
California Newton, Susan Smith, Ida
Olive Hodpen, J. J. Crooks &t executor of
the will of Susan Crooks, Kate M. Skelly,
Mary Rose Crawford, Daniel Crawford,
John Crawford, Kate M. Stoney, Robert
Lee Crooks, Jonathan Peel, Genevieve
Peel, Anita Gonzales the Hibernia Loan
and Savings Society, Christian Strobel,
Thomas Ambrose, Flow Crooks as execu
trix of the will of Stonewall Jackson
Crooks, and half a hundred others.
The real estate involved is mostly lo
cated in this City and is very valuable. It
is scattered ail over the City from North
Beach to the Potrero and from East street
to the park. Quite a lot is on Julian
avenue, near Fift-enth street, not far from
what was formerly Woodward's Gardens,
and some is on Kearny street.
The complaint al:eges that plaintiff
Samuel R. Crooks has an estate of inherit
ance in the propeny, consisting of an in
dividual one-ninih thereof as tenant in
common; that the defendants Jonathan
J. Crooks, Matthew J. Crooks, Robert Lee
Crooks, Margaret Moiffew, California
Newton, SuÂ«an Smith, Ida Olive Hodgen,
who bave each a like individual one-ninth
interest therein, and the defendants Fiow
Crooks and Jackson B. Crooks are also
together the owners of an individual one
ninth part as tenants in common with the
plaintiff.
It is also set forth that the Hibernia
Savings Bank, Thomas Ambrose, Chris
tian Strobel and Kate M. Strong have in
terests in the reai estate in some sort by
reason of mortgage* and liens on the
same. Tbe other defendants have claims,
or at least pretena to have claims, that
ar2 at present unknown.
The plaintiff therefore asks that judg
ment be entered in accordance with ihe
respective rights of the different claim
ants, and that if partition Cannot be made
then that the property be sold and the
proceeds distributed according as the
riehts of the parties may appear.
GOLD NUGGET MAN.
A Trick That He Has Successfully
Played Upoct Several People
Recently.
A tall, elderly man, dressed as a farmer
and known as the "Gold Nuuget Man,"
has, after a lapse of two or three years,
commenced operations aga.n.
The field for his operations is in the
neighborhood of the leading hotels and
banks and he appears U> be an apt stu
dent of human nature, as he seldom meets
with a failure.
His modus operandi is as follows: He
covers a piece of lead about half an inch
long and a quarter of an inch thick with
gold leaf. Then he places it at a conven
ient spot, covering it with du?t or mud to
escape observation. He srntids a t?w feet
away and when he sees a 1 1 tc >^ 1 3- victim ap
nroacbing he picks up the spunou* gold
nugget, faces the approaching victim
scraping the dnst or mud troni it. The
victim, as a rule, asks him what he has
tounu, and he replies, "Look, it is a gold
nugget."
Tne victim becomes interested and when
the old man telis him he is poor and wants
money badly and will part with the nug-
Let for a few doilars tic generally gels the
money and hurries away.
The trick has been played successfully
several times w.thin the past few days.
O::e of bis victims was H. Anderson, a
curt-stone broker on Montgomery stree;,
who parted with $5. Tourists are his par
ticular prey an'i the victims are so dis
gusted with themselves tliat they are
saii^fied to bear the loss of the few dollars
rather than let it be known that they were
so easily duped.
The "gold nugget man" is about 55
yenrs of age, tali and with iron-gray
whiskers closely trimmed. He lives in
the neghborhood of Third street.
THREE FIRES YESTERDAY.

Geary street and a smaller amount to the

MAYOR PHELAN
MAKES PROTEST
Addresses an Open Letter to
the Board of Super
visors.
Opposes the Appointment of a
Deputy District At
torney.
He Says That Th re Will Be No Money
on Hard With Which to Pro
viie a Salary.
Mayor Phelan at the last regular meet
ing of the Board of bupervisors spoke in
opposition to the proposition made for an
assistant to District Attorney Barnes. He
stated some of his reasons for bis opposi
tion. He has now prepared a letter set
tin); forth bis views more fully, which is
as follows:
It 1b proposed to elect a Deputy District
Attorney at a 6aiary of $250 a month, and I
desire to communicate certain information
upon this subject for your guidance. First,
under act of March 2, 1891, the District Attor
ney has power to appoint three deputies, a
chief clerk and two assistant clerks, which
compose his statutory staff, and which I be
lieve to be sufficient lor the proper conduct of
his office. In August, 1895, ihe District Attor
ney asked the Board of Supervisors lor an as
sistant in ihe prosecution of criminal cases,
1 >â¢.â â . ii v- of the Imi mint trial, and W. 8. II inkle
was appointee. Since the" the board nas
passed seven resohuious extending the em
ployment of Mr. Hinkle, generally for three or
four months at a time. The last resolution
was adopted January 2, 1897, permitting him
to retain his position until February 1, 1897,
when his employment ceased.
The Board of Supervisors, in giving addi
tional assistance tn the District Attorney, is
supposed to be acting under the law of May 1,
1801, which confers power upon the Board of
Supervisors "to allow and order paid out of
t."- general funa not to exceed the sum of
$5000 in any one fiscal year for the employ
ment of special counsel." The object of this
act wms to euablo the Board of Supervisors to
employ special conusel in civil case* where
the interests of the City demanded such em
ployment, ana that has been the practice up
to the time of the request made by the District
Attorney, who asked that counsel be allowed
for th â  prosecution of criminal cases.
For the fiscal year ending June next the
followiug sums have already been paid out
and contracted for, which you will see ex
hausts the appropriation of $5000:

From this showing it will appear that there
is no money on hand, even if it were desirable
to pay an Assistant District Attorney for the
balance of the fiscal year.

LECTURES ON BUDDHISM.
Key. Mr. Dharmap ila, the Buddhist
Monk, Speaks to Large
Audiences.
Rev. H. Dbarmapala, the Buddnist
monk, delivered a lecture a Stiles Hall,
in Berkeley, at the invitation of the Uni
tarian congregation, Friday evening, his
subject being "The Reconciliation Be
tween Christianity and Buddhism." He
gave a brief and very lucid exposition of
Buddhism, showing the points of resem
blance between tbe two religious, particu
larly in the ethical teachings. He said lie
thought mat. many of the Buddhistic ten
ets were specially adapted for the Oriental
people and their nature, and that the true
worn of missionaries would be to try and
amalgamate Buddhism and Christianity

CRIMINALS SENTENCED.
Judge l>n)iii<''i I>ock Was Crowded With
Culprits Yesterday,
Judge Frank H. Dunne held a well
attended levee in Department 11 of the
Superior Court yesterday. The dock was
filled wit's criminals and the courtroom
was crowded with the usual number of
sympathizers and spectators. It was noted
that tbere were thirteen in the prisoners'
dock, which, Clerk Martin ser.ously re
marked, was an* unlucky number. The
prisoners probably concurred.
Neal Nicholson was convicted of burg
lary in the first degree for raiding an un
dertaker's shop at night, and was sen
tenced to three years at bard labor in the
State Prison at Folsom. It was fortunate
for Nicholson that he chose a business
place instead of a private residence as the
scene of his depredations, as the courts
deal more sternly with criminals w:io in
vade the homes of citizens than with those
who enter empty nouses, where there is
little danger of murder resulting from the
attempt to plumler the premises.
Michael Enriidit, convicted of grand
larceny, was sentenced to San Quentin for
two years.
Patrick O'Mally was fined $100 for
hitting a policeman on the head with a
club.
Emmett Brennan, who was also found
guilty of grand larceny, had his sentence
postponed until the 13th inst.
Frank Carnivali is a fugitive from jus
tice. He is charged with assault to
murder.
Herman Conn, charged with stabbing
Petronia Quinores on the 17th of last
January, pleaded not guilty io the charge
of assault to murder and will be tried on
the 16th inst
Nine otner culDrita of ereater or lesser
degree also had their cases attended to,
dates of trial set and motion- for reduc
tions of bail and the like heard and deter
mined.
Judge Dunne's calendar is getting in a
better condition than it has been for a
long time. Trials are expedited as much
as possible, having due regard to the in
terests of the community and the rights
of the defendants.
The Labor Convention.
The California Labor Convention will not
hold its regular meeting until next Sunday,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
THIS MAN MADE
REVIVALS A STUDY
And Will Become a Pro
fessor at Stanford
University.
Edwin Diller Starbuck Called
to Palo Alto by Dr.
Jordan.
Will Tak? the Place of Professor
Barnes, Who Is Going; 10
Europe.
Edwin Diller Starbnck of Clark Univer
sity, the nian to whom Professor Jordan
refe-red in his recent remarks upon the
subject of religious revivals, is to be a
professor at Palo Alto.
He is an authority on the effects of re
vivals. It was partly through a perusal
of his treatise entitled "A Study of
Conversion," that the attention of the
president of Stanford University was at-
EDWIN DILLER STARBUCK, an Authority on Religious Revivals
Whom Dr. Jordan Has Called to a Chair at Stanford.
tracted to him. He is a young man, at
present a fellow in philosophy, but
his call to Stanford University ii in
line with the course generally pursued by
Dr. Jordan. He keeps his eye upon the
work and development of young educa
tors throughout the country and when he
believes that he has found an original
thinker who gives promise of adding
something of value to the world's stock
of knowledge he tries to secure him for
the faculty at Palo Alto. It was in this
way that he chose Dr. Rosa and Professor
Powers and several others.
Starbuck will take the place temporarily
of Professor Enrl Barnes, head of the de
partment of education, and will probably
offer in addition to other v/ork a course in
some phase of religion. He will begin his
duties at Palo Alto next September at tne
opening of the new college yenr.
Professor Barnes r.nd his wife, professor
Mary Sheidon Barnes of ihe department
of history, will start for iiuroue late in
May or at the close of the present college
year on a leave of absence of fifteen
months, during which time they purpose
to make a special study of the lÂ«test edu
cational and historical methods in vogue
both in England ana on the Continent.
Their headquarters will be in London,
where Mrs. Barnes hopes to do much his
torical work in the British Museum and
in old libraries. Their trip, while osten
sibly for recreation, will amount prac
tically to a careful and studious investiga
tion of new ideas to be introduced into
their work at Stanford.
btarbucii's ideas on religious revivals are
briefly indicated in tne following extracts
from his study of conversions:
It Is significant that of the whole number of
caseÃ studied, only two or three of those who
had been through revival experiences spoke
iv unqualified terms of the approval of the
usual methods employed. There were a few
of the number who condemned tnem severely.
! here was a general depreciation of the emo
tional pressure usually exerted, and this com
ing from the converts themselves should be of
value.
We have'seen that the average age of revival
conversions is considerably less than the non
revival, which shows that they have been hur
ried. There is every evidence that many of
them have been hastened unduly. Many were
left out ol the study because tiiey had clearly
been forced in to compliance with what they
were not ready intelligently to accept. They
were pulled green and withered.
It was especially true in the case of sensitive
eirls who were carried away by ttie excite
ment and afterward awakened to the fact that
it was not a true experience. It is like pulling
away the folds of a growing bud to disturb un
duly the tender unfolding of religious na
ture. The greatest difficulty seems to be that
the hardened natures who need the help of
violent methods for restoration are the lust to
respond, and meanwhile much harm is done
to those who are receptive and responsive to
finer influences.
Unless the person is ready for a change,
the results of hastening conversion are apt to
be temporary and soon followed by relapse.
We huve seen that "backsliding" much more
often occurs after revival experiences than
after others. The question is, How can we
preserve the essential things in revivals, and
at the same time escape their evil effects ?
How can the uninterested be led to identify
themselves with righteousness and the way
ward be reclaimed without harm to those who
least need the influence of revival tactics?
People snould be dealt with as individuals as
far as possible, instead of in masses. The
higher motives should be appealed to more
and the lower ones less.
Conversion means unselfinx, the entrance
into a new life of insight and love, ana the
wise teacher will naturally hold up those in
centives which are in direct line with the new
life.
Conversion 1* not a matter for the churches
alone. It is under certain conditions a vital,
normal step in individual growth. We shall
learn not only to anticipate, but to brlngabout
such conditions as will foster an awakening of
the whoio being to larger insight.

his accounts against him and he promised
to settle the amount as soon as possible.
He obtained a situation in Jackson, but

Mechanics, which recently closed at Sac
ramento, the following State officers were
elected for the ensuing year: State Coun
cilor, Henry C. Schaertzer of Council No.
35 (re-elected); State vice-councilor, M. H.
Bellinger of Council No. 20; State secre
tary, George E. Terry of Council No. 35

tional representative, R. F. Burns of
Council No. 2a
It was decided that the next meeting of
the State Council shall be held in Bauta
Barbara on the 15th of March, 1898.
The per capita tax was fixed aifl, and
it was decided that no such tax should be
levied on the honorary members of the
order.
During the session there was a great
deal of legislation that was of a character
that while It is of importance to the mem
bers of the order is not of a general
public interest, referring principally to
matters of secret work.
Charters were granted to several coun
cils that were instituted after the adjourn
ment of the previous State Council.
The several recommendations of the
State councilor were all adopted as pre
sented, with two exceptions, and these
were adopted with a slight modification.
In view of the increased labors of the
State Council secretary it was decided to
increase his salary, and during the propo
sition to do this that official was paid a
high compliment for the excellence of his
work aud close attention to the duties of
the office and bis interest in the work of
the order.
The State was divided into three dis
tricts for two purposes, one for the pur
pose of holding the State Council Conven
tion in the districts alternately and the
other for the purpose of having tnree or
ganizers to attend to the advancement of
the order.

JOHN M. OAKLEY
DIED OF DRINK
Dr. Morgan Made a Chem
ical Analysis of His
Stomach.
No Poisons Beyond Those of the
Embalming Fluids Were
Found.
JnstlC9 Barry Says the Palace Hotel.
Need Not Deliver Hs Effects
to the Coroner.
From the investigations of Dr. Morgan,
the chemist of the Coroner's office, it ap
pears that the death of John M. Oakley,
the Pittsbure millionaire, waa caused by
an overindulgence in alcoholic stimu
lants and not by any poison that might
have been administered by himself or
others.
Dr. Morgan made a careful analysis of
the stomach and contents and found no
poisons beyond small quantities of zinc,
arsenic and carbolic acid, that were con
veyed there during the process of em
balming.
The stomach bore evidences of having
been much abused, and death undoubtedly
came from the exhaustion of the vital
forces through dissipation and lack of the
proper nourishment.
The Coroner has decided to hold the in
quest on Oakley's case on Tuesday, and
will sift the matter thoroughly at that
time.
The manager, clerks and other em
ployes of the Palace Hotel will be called
upon to eive their testimony. The jury
will be composed of the following: U A.
Smitn, Arthur Balkman, Thomas McCord,
J. Rittler, James Shute. \V. O'Connor,
Alex Schmulian, G. \V. Newman and A.
.Nordman.
Yesterday the issue concerning the cus
tody of Oaicley's trunk, valise and other
property, which was Jeft at the Palace
Hotel, came finally up foi decision in the
Justices' Court before Justice Barry. The
result was that the search warrant was
dismissed by the justice who found that
it was defective. He ordered that the
trunk and valise and contents, which
have been in the property-room of the
Police Department at the new City Hall,.

A TRUE SPECIALIST.
The record of DOCTOR COOK is sim-
ply a series of professional triumphs.
Equipped with everything essential to the
most modern methods of practice, he has
accomplished greater good, relieved more
suffering, gladdened more hearts, and made
happy more homes within the past few
months thau other physicians have been
able to do in years. He makes no pre-
tensions to perform impossibilities, but
some of his cures do seem but little less
than miraculous. Many of his most bril-
liant triumphs are in chronic, long-linger-
ing diseases, which other physicians have
pronounced hopeless. Prompt and perfect
cures he guarantees.

Good T.mes Adds Another to His List j
of Wins-David Took His Race
Pulled Up to a Walk.
With a gale blowing from tbesou'west
that would cut an aged limburger cheese in
sections of four, and raindrops pattering
on the roofs and window-panes as large as
Sandow's dumbbells, it would seem that
nothing short of the Iron Cross, a ticket
for a free lunch in a racetrack restaurant,
where a doughnut or a "ham and over" is |
as expensive as a I'nited States senator
ship, a Seeley dinner or a picture of
Grover Cleveland frozen in a cake of ice,
would tempt people to attend the races
yesterday. Still, under all of these un
p.easant climatic conditions yesterday,
the popularity of In^leside was again at
tested by a very liberal gathering of rac
ing enthusiasts, on the occasion of the
closing day of the semi-monthly meeting.
The caliber of the sport was excellent,
even if the special mile dash, with Mag
net, David, Damien and l>ibertine, did
not take place, owing to the condition of
the track. Favorites proved successful on
live different occasions, and a second
choice and an outÂ».der, Palmeraton,
backed down lrom 15 to 8, captured the
other two events decided.
The special feature of the card was the
Crocker Belling stake for 2-year-olds at
four furlongÃ, worth about $1500 to the
winner. Eight embryo racers tried for
the prize with the Burns and Waterhouse
pair, Miss Rowena and Duckling, ruling
overwhelming favorites in the betting at
odds of 13 to 20. Of the otner starters
Estro, Aluminum and Queen Mab com
manded the most respect from t tie talent.
Without much delay Havey sent them
away to one of his prettiest starts. Eddie
Jones on Miss Rowena was quickest to get
under way and showed first before the
turn was reached. The chestnut daughter
of Imp Midlothian found the distance a
trifle lengthy before the wire was reached,
but hung on gamely, defeating Alumi
num a scant length in 51^ seconds. Tne
latter a shapely but rather undersized
eoii of imc. Idalium and Glitter, made a
gallant effort to overtake the leader and
had the distance been further hergtme-.
nesa might have proven successfully. Estro
was a close third.
The opening event was a six-furlong
spin with weights raised ten pounds above
tne scale. Good Times, with 119 ud, was
a 7 to 10 favorite, and catching George
M.ller at the paddock, he beat the "Texas
Hindoo" a head in 1:1834- Roy Carruthera,
at odds of 100 tol, nnisned third.
The Corrigan entry Soniro was chalked
up favorite in the belting on the mile sell
ing run that followed, but failed to land
tue coin. Encino showed first as the
i unch swung into the stretch, but aoon i
developed his usual quitting tendency, j
Two Cheers, the second choice, wended i
his way around the bunch and finisued j
first by two lengths with considerable to j
spare. The favorite took the place in a
hard drive from,Encino.
Tnere were but four starters in the mile
handicap, Can't Dance 93, Paiomacita 96,
Lincoln 11 92 and Grey hurst with 94 pounds
ud. The weights looked to favor Can't
Dance, and he was backed down from 8 to
sto evens. Gieyhurst, which opened at
even money, receded to 810 5. Tod Sloan
took the favorite out in front and, never
extended, the Longfellow colt won gallop
ing Jrom Lincoln. Greyhurst, apparently
a trifle stale, was an indifferent third.
Ed Corriaan'oEOod jumper, Reddington,
found easy game in the mile-and-a-quarter

DAYLIGHT BURGLARY.
The Residence of Mr*. Halleck, 114
Scott Street, Entered and Several
Articles Stolen.
A bold burglar visited the residence of
Mrs. Halleck, 114 Scott street, on Thurs
day afternoon and carried away a gold
watch and chain, a valuable diamond pin
and a purse containing ?7 50.
Mrs. Dall, a lady friend of Mrs. Hal
leck's, called upon her that afternoon,
and as she intended remaining for tea she
took off her gold watch and chain and
placed them and her purse in a drawer in
Mrs. Haileck's bedroom alongside a dia
mond pin belonging to Mrs. Halleck.
The ladies went into the parlor and after
chatting for about an hour Mia.. Halleck
had occasion to go into the bedroom. It
occurred to her somehow to look into the
drawer, and to her astoni-hment her
diamond pin and Mrs. Dall's gold watch
and chain and purse had disappeared.
Policeman Durkin was notified and his
suspicions fell upon the Chinese servant,
but after interrogating him he was satis
fied of liis innocence. It is supposed that
a peddler who was seen in the neiuhbor
hood slipped into the house from the rear
door and stole the articles. A number cf
thelts of a similar nature have been com
mitted m that locality lately.
THIS COAST FAVORED.
Appropriations Made for Point Arena
JLife-Saving Station and for a
Tide-Gauge Here.
Captain Merry, secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce, has received a letter from
Senator George C. Perkins, a part of which
is as follows:
We hare teen successful in securing appro
priations in the sundry civil service bill for
the construction of a tide-gauge ia San Fran
cisco showing to vessels entering or leaving
the exact state of the tide, and whether rising
or falling; an appropriation of $250,000 for
dredging a chnnnel at Mare Island, and one
for the compilation of the Alaska coast pilot
and a new survey steamer.
Information lias also been received by
the Chamber of Commerce that an appro
priation favored by that body has been
made for the construction of a iife-saving
station for Point Arena, where several
vessel! have been wrecked.
The Charity GamÂ© Postponed.
Owing to the recent rain the Dry Goods Com
mercial Baseball League has been forced to
postpone their opening until March 14. The
schedule as published will remain unchanged
and the tirst gnme, that Detweeo Newman &
Levinson and J. J. O'Brien & Co., will be
played ior the benefit of the unemployed.
Mayor Pheian will attend the opening game
and start the series by throwing the first ball
into the flel'i.
That a large audience will be in attendance
is assured by the advance sale of tickets,
which though dÂ»ted March 7 will be honored
on March 14. The management oi the league
are as much disappointed as the puDlic over
this forced postponement. However, a glance
at the grounds would convince one of tne im
possibility of ball-playing on the field to-day.

SLID DOWN THE
RAIL TO DEATH
Little Harry Kelly Falls
Three Stories in the
New Brunswick
Happily Playing He Lost His
Balance and Was Precipi
tated Headlong.
He Was Taken to the Receiving Hos
pital and Died in Less Than
Three Hours-
Harry Kelly, a bright boy 6 years of
age, was fatally injured last evening at the
New Brunswick Hotel, 148 bixth street.
Harry was amusing himself by sliding
down the banister from the third to the
second floor along with other boys and
lost his balance. He had just started and
fell from the third floor to the basement,
a distance of about forty feet.
Some of the inmates of the hotel heard
Harry's yeil of fear, followed by the
crash as his body struck the floor in the
basement hallway. Tney ran to the spot
where he lay unconscious and some one
rang up the Receiving Hospital for the
ambulance.
The boy was taken to the hospital and
Drs. Fitzgibbon and Maher found that his
skull was fractured, his ribs were broken
and he was injured internally. They ex
pressed the opinion that ho could not live
many hours, which was verified, as the
boy breathed his last about 9 o'clock.
Harry lived in the hotel with his
mother, Mrs. Patrick Kelly. She had
just left the hotel when one of the other

euests overtook her and told her of her
son' 3 accident. She hurried back and her
grief was terrible as she gazed upon his
mangled body. She remained at the
hospital till he died, and it was a hard
taÂ»K for Dr. Fuzgibbon to tell her that the
end had come.
"It was only yesterday," she wailed,
"that I cauehthim sliding down the ban
isters, and I whipped him for doing it.
He promised ne wouldn't do it again. I
had juut left the hotel to visit a friend, and
had scarcely walked a block when a man
came running after roe and told me what
had happened."
"Oh, why did I not take him with me?"
she cried, as she wrune her hands and
paced excitedly up and down the corridor
in the hospital.
The body was removed to the Morgue,
and an inquesc will be held.
CROWLEY'S DEPOSITION.
The Chief of Pollen Would Not Break
Up the Headquarters of the
See YupÂ«.
The hearing of the ca*e of the See Yup
Society against Fong Yuen Hing, the
Chinese Consul, was resumed in United
States Commissioner Reacock's court yes
terday with the offering in evidence by
the attorney for the society of the deposi
tion of Chief of Police Crowley.
Darin ; the early part of the hearing of
the case Attorney J. C. Campbell, who
represents the See Yups, said that be in
tended to prove that the Chief had been
approached by the Consul, who asked him
to break up the See Yup Society by wreck
ing its headquarters.
That the Chief refused to because he
thought it was unlawful, and told the Con
sul to do it himself if he was so auxious to
have it done.
That the Consul had offered to indem
nity the Chief against damages in $0000
and later in $10,000, but that the head of
the Police Department had refused to
bar* anything to do with the matter on
the ground that no indemnity would jus
tify an unlawful act.
The deposition produced bore out the
statements made by Mr. Campbell, and
will be among the important documents
that will be laid before the Chinese Minis
ter at Washington, and before the Na
tional Government, if such a measure be
comes necessary.

Polished Marble in the City Hall Dome
to Be Viewed by Experts.
The City Hall Commissioners have de
cided to consult experts concerning the
polishing of the marble work in the dome
of the new City Hall, concerning which
complaints have been made. Representa
tives of the Marble Cutters' and Finish
ers' Association yesterday visited the new
City Hall and declared that tne polishing
was not satisfactory and tliat the crevices
were filled with beeswax. Architect Shea
said that the marble had been polished by
machinery and was not as high a polish
as that done by hand, as shown by the
sample submitted by the complainants.
Ship for India to Be Ready.
A letter was received yesterday by the
Chamber oi Commerce from the Secretary of
the Navy Baying that In accordance with re

The figures showing the total amount of
sweet wines produced in this S.ate during
the past season have just been made pub
lic by the Internal Revenue Office.
They show that the product for the year
will fall 50 per cent below that of last,
owing to some extent to the fact that the
grape crop was short of other years.
The season during which wine-manu
facturers receive the brandy used to fortify
their product free of charge is from Au
gust 1 to May 1, they being compelled at
other times to pay a tax of $1 10 per gal

SELLING TICKETS
FOR THE FIGHT
Two Thousand Reserved

Oakland.
Sanguine Predictions Concerning
the Attendance About
the Ring.
Twenty-five Privata Detectives May
B; Sent Up to Carson to
Keep Order.
The sale of seats for the Fitzsimmons-
Corbett fight began in this City at noon
yesterday. The sale was carried on by
Edward G. Coot. W. H. Clark, Dan
Stuart's cousin, was present, but took no
active part.
All orders from the smaller cities of the
interior have been filled from Carson.
Many San Franciscans have also procured
tickets in the same way. The sale will
close at noon, March 14.
It was stated yesterday by Agent Cook
that the sale of ticket* bad been a most
pleasant surprise to Stuart, as the pro
ceeds would almost double his expecta
tions. He believes that there will be 20,000
people present.
"Last Thursday," said Clark, "an order
came in from Pittsburg for 175 seats and
for 260 from St. Louis. Small places,
where we expected to disrx>se of only two
or tnree seats, nave sent in orders for from
six to ten."
As soon as the sale opened Billy Wil
liams for Charles L. A*her of the Baldwin
Hotel purchased $1500 worth of $40
tickets. During the afternoon nearly 200
tickets were sold. About half were for $40
seats, and the proceeds, according to
Agents Cook and CiarK, amounted to
nearly $6000. Many tickets were also sold
in the evening.
If was expected that 5000 tickets would
be sold in this City alone, but that the es
timate has been reduced considerably is
shown by the fact that just 2000 tickets
have been retained to supply the demand
of both Oakland and San Francisco.
In the morning some time was spent in
a consultation between Captain Hind of
the Pinkerton Detective Agency and Clark.
An agreement was reached that probably
twenty-live Pinkerton men will be sent to
Carson.
Their duties will consist in taking charge
of the gates into the pavilion, to kee-D a
close lookout for thieves and to assist in
preserving good order generally.
Clark seems to be enthusiastic over the
condition of the principals and gave it as
his opinion that the contest would not
terminate under ten rounds, and may last
much longer.
"It is hardly possible," he asserted,
"that either man will take any chances
when so muqh depends upon the result. I
believe that they will try to size each
other up for at least live rounds, Fitzsim

tactics and Corbett because of hia lanky

GET SOME ROSES IN YOUR CHEEKS. YOU CAN DO IT.
Winter is about over. Hoary frost and cold rains are giving way
to sunshine and light showers. Now is the time to begin to get a stock
of good health. If you wish to put the blood in good order, if you wish
to get rid of your pimples and facial blemishes, if you want to clean the
Liver, Stomach and Bowels, use the native Sarsaparilla. It is called
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. This vegetable remedy is a first-class
laxative and it does not gripe. v It is pleasant to the taste and agreeable
in its effects. The many people who have used Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla praise it. Here are a few of the people's good wishes:
Mrs. William T. Bulmer of Stockton writes:
"Edwin W. Joy Company â Gentlemen: Your Sarsaparilla is cer-
tainly a fine laxative and it has brought me good health. I took a few
bottles of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and I- was. astounded with the
results. I never took any medicine that was so pleasing. I) got rid of
my. sallow complexion and dragging sensations. I hope some poor suf-
ferer will read this and get a bottle of Joy's. It is a good Spring
Medicine."
H. J. Mulvaney of Monterey says:
"Edwin W. . Joy Company â Dear Sirs: I was cured of a bad at-
tack of Rheumatism by the use of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I had
a chronic constipation that never seemed to be relieved. I had always
to be taking some pills. Well, now I take nothing. Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla cured me." Â« â 'â¢â¢'.-'â¢.:â¢â â  ";â¢â¢'" **-
Miss Emilie Jennings of Little Shasta, Shasta County, Gal., says: ;
"I was in San Francisco three weeks ago. I asked for a bottle of
Joy's Sarsaparilla in a corner drugstore. They insisted on my taking
something just as good. I took a half bottle of a sarsaparilla I never
heard of before, and it liked to kill me. I got disgusted and bought a
bottle of jdy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla from a reliable drugstore. lam
feeling fine. All the pimples left my face. I can do my work without
getting weary. - : I used to get so tired at times. I can certainly praise
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla." \-

AGAIN IN THE TOILS.
Alonzo J. YFhlteman, a Notorious Con
fidence Operator, Arrested for Swin
dling a New York Bank.
Captain Lees was notified last night by
the Pinkerton agency, New York, that
Alonzo J. Whiteman had been arrested
there for swindling the Columbia Bank,
501 Fifth avenue. On February 20 he de
posited in the bank a check for $3700 that
afterward proved to be forgod, and on
February 23 presented a check for $600,
drawn to order of "currency," and got the
money.
Whiteman, according to the Pinkertons
and Captain Lees, is one of the most no
torious confidence operators and forgers
in the United States. About two years
ago he passed a forged check for $500,
signed Frank Dixon, on J. D. Maxwell,
an insurance ngent.
He was arrested in New Jersey and
fought his extradition, but was finally
brought back here by Detective Ross
WhitaJcer and tried for the crime of
forgery. Judge Wallace on August 30,
1895, sentenced him to nine years in San
Qaentin, but in September, 1896, he was
granted a new trial and was acquitted.
Whiteman at one time was a member of
the State Senate of Minnesota. He squan
dered between $200,000 and $300,000 in
herited from his father's estate. Then he
became a professional swindler and ope
rated in different cities. His sister, Mrs.
Gibbs of Dansville, N. V., always came to
bis relief and he escaped punishment.

"The Southern Pacific Railroad esti
mates there will be 12,000 people at Carson
to see the Corbett-Fitzsimmons battle,"
said W. H. Mills yesterday. "Of this
number about 40C0 will go from Nevada
and 8000 from the East and PaciQc Coast.
All the Pullman cars not absolutely in use
for twenty-four nour runs are to be nsed
for Carson light purposes. The road- has
sent East for more Pullmans, and is naul
ing one or two empty Pullmans by every
tram.
"It appears, however, that three or four
persons are going by ordinary coacb to
one in the Pullmans, which seems to indi
cate that many comparatively poor people
are going to see tbe tight.
"There never was a better prospect for
fruit in California than at present. The
season is four or tive weeks behind last
year. The winter has been cold and back
wa d. However, if we get a day or two of
quite warm weather after the prevailing
rain the buds are likely to shoot at once.
"The prospect for grain of all Kinds is as
fine as could be desired. Wheat is in ex
cellent condition and coming in rapidly.
Oats, barley and other grain are the same.
Grass is also growing rapidly, and the in
dications are that there will be a ytiy
heavy crop.
"Mining in California is extremely satis
factory at present. Everything appertain
ing toit is in better shape than for years.
Mining men report that it is very active
out in the mountains. There is plenty of
water everywhere."

OAKLAND ELECTS NEW OFFICIALS TO-MORROW.
To-morrow Oakland will cast its ballots
md maKo its choice of otiicials out of a
wide variety of nominees â a wide variety
of men and parties. It will close one of
the most notable campaigns the city has
seen. The great question of the cam
paign is of course the anti-saloon move
ment. The result of it is in doubt, the
pros and cons being equally confident.
Following is a word or two concerning
the candidates on the three principal
tickets, as to who they are and upon what
grounds they ask the suffrages of the
people. A few independent candidates
are making the canvass, but their chances
of election are small.

worker for goo't roads and is indorsed by
the irood roads association. He has been
handicapped, however, through being so
little known. He has oeen making up tor
this as best he can by an active canvas.
He is a man of family.
S. Goodenough, People's party candi
date for Mayor, is a resident of the Fifth
Ward. He founded the First Universalist I
Church, ana was pastor until three years
ano, when he resigned from the ministry.
He is a fruit-grower, and was for several

A. C. Henry, who is making an inde
pendent run for Mayor, is one of the old
est residents of Oakland. Mr. Henry and
bis wue came aero*< the plains in pioneer
days, and his business enterprises in this
city pave been very successful. He has,
at d Keren t times, founded four of the
most substantial of Oakland's bunks. At
present Mr. Henry is president of the
California and Nevada Meat Company,

one of the wealthiest men in this city.
He has always been a Republican and has
always supported the party financially.
He did not approve of the manner in
which the last convention was held, and
decided to run alone. Mr. Henry was
once Mayor of Oakland and he has also
been Tax Collector.
The Republican Candidates.
Auditor â Roland W. Snow is serving
his fourth term as City Auditor, and surh
is b's certainty of being returned again
that the Democrats made no nomination.
Mr. Snow comes of an old line. He was
born in 1850 on Marthas Vineyard, Mass.,
which was purchased by his ancestors in
1640 from Lord Sterling. He is a descend
ant of Governor Mayhew, but was adopted
83 a child by Joshua Snow, a shipmaster.
He came to Oakland in 1875. He was the
first and has been the only City Auditor
Oakland has had.
City Treasurerâ Z. T. Gilpin has been
City Treasurer for several years, and like
Auditor Snow he practically is without
opposition in this campaign. He is a busi
ness man rather than a politician, and is
respected as such. He makes no speeches,
but attends to business in such i ash ion as
to enlist the confidence of the electors of
cl 1 , parties. The Democrats have made no
nomination for this office.
City Attorneyâ W. A. Dow is a wÂ«>ll
taovo attorney of this city. Four years
ago he was elected to the City Council by
the Municipal League at the same time
Dr. Pardee was elected Mayor. He served
laithfully during the period of activity in
the water-front litigation and has won
public favor by his official conduct. He
is familiar with the work that falls to the
office of City Attorney and has been
heartily indorsed by several organizations.
City Engineer â Anhur R. Wilson, the
incumbent, is the Republican nominee.
He is an experienced and energetic offi
cial. He has effected improvements dur
ing bis term of office as Engineer and
member of the Board of Public Works in
the Street Department and in the Police
and Fire departments. He is recognized
as the friend of organized labor.
t Councilman at Large â H. D. Talbott is
an attorney. He presided over the last
Republican convention. He is not an old
resident of Oakland, and the prominent
place he has taken in Republican politics
is an evidence of his native force and
abilities. He is an old veteran and a
prominent member of the G. A. R.
Councilman at Large â B. C. Cuvellier
lives in West Oakland, and it is to his
energy and perseverance that that part of
the city owes its park. He labored as
iiduously for the improvement and the
marsh at West Oakland will soon be a
thin? of the Dast. He has always been
identified with progressive interest! in the
city.

I will encourage home industry and the establishment of manufacturing enter
prises, and do ail in my power to develop our extraordinary commercial facilities.
I will encourage competing railroads to make their terminals in Oakland and
favor the prosecution of the present water-front suits to a final issue.
I regret that the state of my health will not permit me to make an active per

fully believe the result will bs for the best interests of the city. Very truly yours.
. W.K. THOMAS.
Oakland's hope of becoming a great commercial and manufacturing city rests in a
large degree upon the improvement in a practical and substantial way of her great
natural harbor advantages. To this end I shall in the future, as I baye in the past, do
all in mv power to urge forward the water-front litigation to the
court of last resort or until the city is auain in possession of her WHAT
entire water iront. â¢
On thi?, to the people of Oakland the all-important question, DAVIE
my record is without qualification. The initiatory step which led
to a decision of the 'Supreme Court that the party that had for WOULD DO.
thirty years held the city's water front had no title to the prop
erty was taken by Councilman Bassett and myself and we pushed the contest to a de
cree sustaining the city's title.
There had previously been much litigation on the water front, but, in every
case, at the critical moment, the city's interests were either abandoned or sacrificed
to other interests. Our contention was on the merits of the case.
We made the contest on principle, and upon principle we were determined either
to win or lose. At the end of six months' litigation, which, it will be remembered,
was carried on at our individual expense and did not cost the city a dollar, we non
suited our opponents and obtained a decision, but for which it is more than probable
the city never would have made another attempt to regain her water front, without
which she conld not hope to become what she will with it â a gruat commercial port.
In the prosecution of this water-front litieation, the result of which promises bo
much to the people of Oakland, and in building a wharf and bulkheads upnn the
property, which on the final decision will pass to the city, I expended some $40,000.
On this exDenrtiture I have received no return, and I have been compelled to assign
the property as security for some of the money expended in its creation. My record
on the water-front issue is well known to every citizen of Oakland, and the facts
above mentioned art merely noted as evidence of my unfaltering purpose to in every
way aid the city in her efforts to regain her water front
In this connection I will call attention to the fact that the opposition ferry
established by myself and associates, while a pecuniary loss to the projectors led to a
reduction of passenger fares and freight rates between this city and San Francisco
which saves the people not less than $1000 per day. These fares and rates can never
be increased except by c >nsent of the Board of Railroad Commissioners. This benefit
to the public is not only substantial but permanent.
I shall in the future, as I have in the past, advocate economic government. In
my mes-ege to the Council vetoing the $1 18 tax levy I offered to guarantee an ex
penditure of $75,000 per year on permanent improvements out of a $1 tax levy besides
meeting all the legitimate claims against the city.
After two years' study in municipal affairs I am satisfied that upon a $1 limit of
taxation $100,000 may be annually expended on permanent improvements without
impairing the usefulness and efficiency of a ninele department.
My two years' experience as Mayor goes far to convince me that during the last
five years enough of tr.e people's money has been frittered away through $499 resolu
tions and by other means, for which there has been comparatively no return to have
done much toward building a substantial City Hail.
I have been, and shall continue to be, a strong advocate of public improvements.
During my term of offiue I have signed ordinances for the construction of the boule
vard, for the purchase and improvement of a park for West Oakland, for the construc
tion of East Twelfth street as a main thoroughfare, for a new engine-house on Sixth
street, for the purchase of a steam rollerâ this lpst can, I am conlident be manufac
tured by a local firmâ and for the repair of Telegraph avenue.
I shall continue to urpe the importance of making all improvements, particularly
of streets, bridges and buildings, of so solid and permanent a riatufe that the outlay
for maintenance will not be so considerable as heretofore.
I belive it is possible for municipalities to select from public officials who are able
and willing to manage the city's business with the care and economy that private
business is managd and to handle the money of the taxpayers with prudence judg
ment and economy that characterizes the handling of their own money. So far as in
my power I have endeavored to act upon a policy based on this belief and if the
people re-elect me to the office ot Mayor I shall continue the support of this policy
A glance at the high rate of taxation that prevailed for the past six years will satisfy
any one that it has not been for want of funds that.Oakland's improvements are "n
general, of such an unsubstantial nature. The taxpayers have supplied the funds
but they have received little in return that is solid and enduring. The salary and
maintenance claims have often depleted, the treasury.
I believe economy and progression may go hand in hand. I believe more may be
done than has been done with a lower tax levy than has, as a rule, been imposeJ upon
the taxpayers. One of the first questions asked by persons seeking investment is what
is your tax rate for city purposes? We should so conduct or municipal affairs that
we can answer this question to the satisfaction of the questioners. I am and shall
continue to be an advocate of as low a rate of taxation as will meet the requirements
of an economic but progressive government.
If elected Mayor I shall, as heretofore, devote mv entire time to the business of
the city to the end that I may act intelligently in all matters affecting the city's in
terests in the many duties pertaining to the office of Mayt>r, of Police and Fire Com
missioner and member of the Board of Public Works.
The annual election of public-school teachers is not, in my judgment authorized
by the Btate law. It is a custom that should be abandoned. Teacher* should be
permanently employed during their competency. This would take the School Depart
ment out of politics. The cost of maintaining the city's public schools could I be
lieve, be materially reduced without in the least impairing its usefulness and efficiency
If I am re-elected I shall do my utmost to advance the interest* of the whole city*
keeping ever in mind the important lact that the exigency of the times demands as
low a rate of taxation as is consistent with that progression essential to the due and
proper standing of our beautiful city. j l ijaVIE
In accepting the nomination for the office of Mayor for the city of Oakland I hare
carefully considered the duties and responsibilities of the office, and am prepared, if
elected, to devote my time, my energies and my best abilities to the faithful
perform
ance of the Mayor's duties. My sole hmbition would be to makÂ«
a record for faithfulness, efficiency and devotion to the public
interests, bo that all citizens, irrespective of party, would join in
saying at the end of my term of office: -'His work has been well

energetic, firm and watchful.' lam under no pledge or promise of any kind to any
one. I shall so continue henceforth, and prefer defeat in this way to election'in any
otuer. If elected I shall enter office free and untrarumeled, prepared to act in accord
ance with my best judgment for the good of the whole city.
The study and practice of the law for the past fourteen years will assist me in
mastering the details of the water-front litigation. These suits should be pressed for
ward as speedily as possible, lor at best such litigation is too lengthy. The city's title
to the water front cannot be too soon recognized and determined by the courts for
Oakland's commerce and industries are impatiently awaiting the time when the city
â¢ball be restored :o ncr own and shall control and manage her harbor facilities.
The competing railroads of Los Angeles and Spokane constantly present tons the
industrial and commercial advantages of additional railroad facilities. It should be
the foremost ambition of the Mayor to procure for Oakland the w< stern terminal of
the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. All legitimate inducements should te held out.
The bonus heretofore subscribed by public spirited citizens has lapsed by expiration
of time. The institution of a new subscription list siiould be one of the efforts of
Oakland's next Mayor. In facilitating the procurement of rights of way for the new

road Oakland should sot allow the interior cities to excel her. She should win and
wear the palm.
Oakland has a great industrial and manufacturing future before her. With ad
ditional railroads and the control of her water front restored, great factories, mills
and foundries would line her shores. The Mayor of Oakland as its chief executive ot
ficer should endeavor to induce the location of such industries here. In the present
time of financial stringency and commercial depression Oakland must be particularly
active in these directions and. the spirit of enterprise and advancement aroused and
encouraged.
We are not now in a condition to bear an increase of the tax rate. Incomes are
diminished, and business is not as profitable as formerly. We must practice economy
in our city as well as in onr household affairs. But let it be a wise economy. Let not
the cent saved obscure the dollar lost thereby. A tax rate of not to exceed $1 10 is
under economical expenditure sufficient to pay the interest on our bonds, carry on
the city government and at the same time produce a substantial public improvement
each year.
We must not allow what we have procured at the expenditure of millions to decay
and become useless for lack of repair, nor is it wise economy to neglect the sanitary
and commercial conditions of the community. Under a tax rate ot not to exceed $1 10
the city can preserve its present possessions and add year by year to its improvements.
The West Oakland marsh should be reclaimed as a sanitary necessity and to
remove from the eyes of visitors here the blot upon the landscape that first greets
them upon their arrival. The streets of the city are its commercial arteries. They
should be restored 10 the condition they were in some twelve years ago as
rapidly as possible. It has been demonstrated that a substantial improve
ment in this direction ran be made each year by the fact that by reason of
the energy and activity of the Good Roads Association, the Board of Trade
and the Merchants' Exchange $25,000 has been this year set apart by the Council for
the pavement of East Twelfth street, from First avenue to Eleventh avenue. The re
clamation of the marsh is also in progress. As much and more can be done every
year, until in a few years Oakland's main thoroughfares, at least, shall be in rood
condition. It is the squandering of public funds that must be guarded against, and
the Mayor's chief duty is to be ever vigilant in this direction. If elected Mayor I
should personally supervise ail public work and require its performance in strict ac
cordance with specifications. I should at all times favor the acceptance by the city of
streets put into the re quired condition at the expense of the property-owners.
An ordinance has oeen prepared by a committee of which I am a member which
covers this matter specifically, and which will shortly be presented to the Council.
Upon public wort I favor the employment of bona-fide residents of Oakland.
The public schools should be liberally supported.
Horace Mann, the celebrated educator of New England, was a member of my
family. lam a graduate of the public school system of this State. I graduated from
the University of California in 1881. My brother, A. L. Mann, was Superintendent of
Public Instruction in San Francisco and is now principal of the Denman Grammar
School. These connections ought to bespeak for me my views upon the public scnool
question.
Such in brief is my position upon some of the matters which I consider of im
portance to Oakland.
Space forbldi me from referring to other matters or going more into detail at this
time - SETH MANN.
Firstâ l will so arrange my business as to give the fullest attention to the duties
of the office and give to the city a practical business administration.
Second â I will cultivate harmony between the executive and legislative depart
ments of the city government in order that the interests of the
oitv may be most effectually promoted. WHAT
Thirdâ l will carry a like spirit into my relations with the
Board of Public Works, Board of Police Commissioners and GOODENOVOH
Board of Fire Commissioner!). The most important adminis
trative interests of the city are embraced in th- specific duties of WOULD DO
these three organizations, and therein the Mayor will be ex
pected to find the fieid of his largest usefulness.
Fourthâ l shall co-operate coidialiy witu the Board of Education Board of
Library Trustees and Board of Health on the important duties of heir respective
department!).
Fifthâ lt will be my pnrpose to keep in close touch with the peopie and acquire
the clearest possible understanding of their interests and needs; hence suggestions
coming from the people will always receive candiu consideration.
Sixthâ l am impressed with tne great morit of the plan which Mayor Josiah
Quincy of Boston has adopted. He has formed a sort of cabinet or advisory commit
tee of seven gentlemen, selected from as many different lines of business and industry
who voluntarily meet with him at stated times and advise concerning all questions of
larf.e municipal importance. The plan has worked admirably and is growing in pop
ular favor. I believe that representatives selected from the Board of Trade the Mer
chants' Exchange, the Good Roads Association, the Federated Trades, the' Builders'
Association and, it may be, others, could and would give the Mayor most valuable
aid and counsel. By this or some other equally practical method I shall aim to secure
the complelest possible understanding of all important matters requiring my official
action. *
Seventhâ l am unqualifiedly in favor of a generous policy of public improve
ments, with rigid economy in expenditure. What tli taxpayers of Oakland want is
that every dollar paid out of the city fumis shall be for 100 cents' worth of benefit to
tne city. Upon this basis there will never be a high rate of taxation, and all expen
ditures will be in the nature of permanent investment.
Eighthâ l am in hearty sympathy with the pronounced demand for good roads.
We have already made a small beginning in the way of permanent street improve
ment, and I shall promote its extension as rapidly as possible. Good roads are a sure
index of advance and advancing civilization.
Ninthâ l shall give earnest attention to the subject of sanitation. Oakland can
be made to take the highest rank as a city of healthtui homes.
Tenthâ l shall endeavor to secure the early acquirement by the city of municipal
public utilities in order both to reduce the cost of service to the people and lighten
the burdens of taxation.
Eleventh â I shall press the water-front suits to a decision favorable to the City by
every resource at the command of the Mayor's office.
Twelfthâ The question 01 a public park commensurate with the present and pros
pective needs of our city is beginning to attract the attention that Its importance
deserves, and I can do no more than promise to assist in reaching a satisfactory solu
tion of the problems which it involves.
. Thirteenth â I shall urae the economy of providing employment for as many resi
dent workingmen as possible in needed public improvements. It is cheaper than
charity, because the city gets value received for money thus paid out. The worst uae
that can be made of men is to support them in idleness.
Fourteenth â In these and other ways I shall aim to foster and encourage the com
mercial, manufacturing, mercantile, industrial and social interests ot Oakland, and
rouse our city from the lethargy into which she has fallen. This should be the great
railroad center of the Pacific Coast. We should not miss our present opportunity of
facilitating the terminus of the Valley road at our own water front. Other lines
would follow until the transportation system of our country will meet at our wharves
the commerce of a hemisphere. S. GOODENOUGH.
I will endeavor to conduct the affairs of the city as I would my own private busi
nest. In fact, I think it is the duty of a public official to use greater discretion and
more Vigilance in looking after the business of the municipality over which he is
selected to officiate than over his own affairs. With the private
citizen, he is handling his own money and has no one to account
to but himself. â¢
On the other hand, the official in whom the trust of the people
Is reposed act* as tne representative of all, and must use great
care in putting out the money received from the many. All
must be treated alike, and tne judgment of a practical business

WOULD DO.
man is needed to inure an economical yet progressive administration. For every
dollar of tax paid in this city should receive the full 100 cents' valuation.
The condition of our streets is a matter of grave moment. I would try to see that
every one of them is put in first-class condition. Not paved as in the past, sometimes,
with large rocks at the bottom over a faulty bed and screenings on tcrp, bat with
honest materialâgood, substantial rock of uniform size that shall form a compact and
solid surface. If the paving is done properly it will last for years and save the city
thousands of dollars.
Then, too, the streets should be beautified. Along the business thoroughfares and
main arteries the streets should be bituminized. Take for instance Ninth street. Ten
years ago I saw that this was properly bituminized and it has not cost the city one
cent for repairs since. Some other streets on which work has been done much later have
been a continual burden and are now in a bad condition owing to hasty and faulty
paving. When the streets are once thoroughly renovated the city should take charge
of them and see that they are nicely kept.
I would encourage all manufactories, industries and competing railroads. One
line wants to come in here now and there should be no stone left unturned by the city
to get it. Being tne terminus of another railroad means much to Oakland. It will
give employment to many citizens, help increase the population and is certain to have
a beneficial effect on commerce.
As far as the water-iront suits are concerned, tney should be rushed on to a
speedy and certain termination. Oakland must have her water front and I would
never sign a release of it in any way. The cases have now been in court off
and on for forty years and they should be kept there until we get a definite answei,
one way or the other. Doubtless they will be decided in our favor. Wlien once the
city nets possession of Its rightful property there shou d be no delay in improving it.
Next I would try to buiid the city up in population and commercial importance.
I would try to give out the public work to our own laborers and mechanics, thus
keeping the money at home as far as possible and giving tne needy ones an oppor
tunity to earn an honest living. The improvements which should be made are many
and home labor should be recognized to the exclusion of outsiders.
In municipal affairs I would seek harmony between the executive and legislative
departments to the end that the best interests of the city may be subserved and so
that no internal bickerings shall be as a stumbling-block in the onward march of
progress.
Lastly, I would urge an economical, conservative, yet progressive administration
of affairs. I would do all in my power to advance Oakland until it finally reaches the
high plane of prosperity which its natural advantages have preordained for it. Yours
respectfully, A. C. HENRY.

NEW TO-DAY.
A MASS OFSOREST
Eczema Quickly Cured by
the Electro-Medical Treat-
ment When All Else Failed.
THIS WELL KNOWN OLD PIONEER OF CALIFORNIA,
I through whose veins courses the stanchest blood of the Revolu-
tionary days, who resides at 905 Fillmore street, in this city, wrote to
a friend a few days ago as follows :
â¢A.XJO2STSZ O MORROW.
' San Francisco, February 23, 1897.
"Dear Sib: I have just been cured of eczema by the Electro-Medical Cure, which
recently created such a Juror of excitement in the scientific world. For many lons
months I had suffered intolerable itching on my chest, back and neck. Haying tried
m*ny remedies and doctors, I whs astonished at the rapid relief I received at the State
Electro-Medical Institute, at 3 Eddy street, near Market. The eminent specialists of
tne Institute, who discovered this combined ; treatment of medicine and electricity,
have not only effected a complete cure of my ailment, but have made a number of
cures in other diseases that I know of which are truly wonderful."
ALONZO MORROW, 905 Fillmore street, San Francisco, Cal.
ONE AMONG MANY.
Mr. Morrow's statement is but one among hundreds that have: been received
from people who are overjoyed at being cured of ailments, such as Asthma, Bron-
chitis, Catarrh, Neuralgia, Heart Disease, Dyspepsia, Eye Disease, Skin Disease,
Rheumatism, Malaria, Nervous Diseases, Kidney Diseases, Insomnia, Hysteria,
Dysentery, Paralysis, Rickets, Scrofula, Consumption, Liver . Diseases, Diseases of
Bowels, Ovarian Diseases, Sciatica, Tumors and Abnormal Growth, Deformities,
Spinal i Disease, Varicocele and Rupture, which have proved too stubborn for
other medical skill. .
SCIENTIFIC APPLIANCES.
In the administration of the Electro-Medical Treatment the Institute uses the
most complete and costly Galvanic, Faradic and Static batteries, the Static battery
alone costing over $1000. The X-Ray, too, has proved itself of inestimable value in
determining the location, extent and character of disease. .
HOME TREATMENT.
# If you cannot visit the Institute write for . the neat and effective body battery,
which can be worn under the clothing, next to the skin, day and night. The poles
of the battery are placed on the medicine-pads ; the electricity passes through them,
carrying the medicine right to the diseased parts, giving almost immediate relief and.
effecting cures where all other kinds of treatment have failed.

NOW OUT OF JAIL
Taken to the Home of a
Good Woman in
Oakland.
Mrs. Mary L. Martin Is to Act
as Mother Pro Tempore
in This Case.
Mrs. Holstrcm ani Mrs. d'Artnay
Faced Each Olh^r in Juige Cof.
fey's Court Yesterday.
Judge Coffey's court-room was crowded
with women at 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon as that was the hour set for hearing
the application to take little Effie V. R.
Holstrem from the City Jail and give her
into the custody of some good woman
who would properly care for her, and as
Judge Coffey hoped, would supply to the
child habiliments appropriate to her sex,
Mrs. Sarah d'Aruiay, mother of the
child, was in court, as was also Mrs. Mary
Lucinda Holstrom, the foster-mother, and
as they faced each other it was apparent
that there was r.o love lost between them,
no matter vAat may be their affection for
the baby girl, Effie.
In t!ie preliminary stage of the proceed
ings there was a scene which threatened
to de>elop into a free fight, because the
bitter feelings which exist between At
torney Eugene Deuprey and Special Offi
cer Kane of the Society for the Prevention
of Vice. la their ardor they were led to
overstep the boun ds of propriety.
"The child was taken by force from the
residence of a private citizen by this fel
low Kane, who is come to be known as a
regular kidnaper," remarked Mr. Deu
prey.
"You're a liar," mildly responded Kane,
who stood in the rear of the room. The
remark was not in Mr. Kane's ordinary
tone, and so the words were not heard by
Mr. Deuprey, but were caught by the court.
Both gentlemen were severely rnided by
Judge Coffey. He told them that they
ought to be fined $200 each and sent to
jail lor two days.
On account of the opposition to her ap
pointment Mrs. Barron withdrew her ap
plication for the position of guardian or
mother pro tempore of the little girl, and
Mrs. Mary L. Martin, who lives at the
Girard House in Oakland, was introduce^
to the court as a proper person to assume
that responsibility.
She testified that she was moved to
make the offer voluntarily on account of
an article which she read ia The Call,
uiv.ng the particulars about a lutie girl
being incarcerated in the City Prison in
the vicinity of murderers and ottier male
factors. She said she had often read of ]
rases whrre children were ill treated, but
no other case had appealed to her sympa
thies as this had.
Attorney Matt I. Sullivan drew out the
admission that Mrs. Holstrom asked Mrs.
Martin to apply lor the custody of the
child, but the lady insisted that she had j
not made up her minJ to do so untii the i
rend an account of the case in her morning I
paper. Mrs. Martin presented recom
mendations from Judge Ham and the
Chief of Police of Oakland and other re
putable citizens showing her to be a
proper person to have charge of the child.
Another quarrel occurred between Mr.
Kane ar.d Mr. Deuprey, and the court
compelled both of them to sit down. Mr.
Kane was reminded that he was not an
attorney, and that he has no business to
stand in- a threatening attitude while a
witness is giving testimony. He was re
quested to desist from this custom here
after.
Mrs. Mary Lucinda Hoistrorn, the foster
mother, was sworn. She admitted that
she had cut the girl's hair and had
put hÂ«r in boy's clothes, saying that
she did so because Mr. Kane had threat- j
ened to seize the chid the first time he j
had a chance to lay hands on her, and for i
fear that the threat would be carried out
the little one had been disguised. She
thought she was justified in doing so.
Mrs. Holstrom ai.-o confessed to Mr.
fuilivan that Mrs. Vaikeubeig WM on
her way to Fresno with the liitte girl
when arrested, but she said she had no
intention of taking the child outside the
State of California or beyond the jurisdic
tion of the court.
When asked if she was willing to have
the child placed temporarily in ti:eCar c
'if some good society for the protection of
children, ehe burst out :
"No, no; don't send her to any society.
Let some kind woman have her. I don't
want Mr. Kane to have anything to do
witn her. He dragged her from me one
morning before she had her breakfast, and
he wouldn't let me dress her or kisa her,
and said I had no right to touch her, al
though I had loved her and car6d for and
nurtured her for four years just as if she
had been my own."
The court and alltne lawyers were try
ine to stop the flow of words, but it was
useless to attempt to stem the tide until |
the tears came to their rescue and hers.
Then she wept as if her heart would break
and it was noticed that quite a number in
the courtroom suddenly required the
services of their handkerchiefs.
Judge Coffey looked dietressed, for he
haa a man's dislike for scenes. He waited
patiently until the lady regained her com
posure, and when she said that all she
wanted was for the baby to have its rights
she was assured that the coun would do
possible in that regard.
I Mr. Deuprey said that if Mrs. Martin
vnonld not prove acceptable, he wouid sug
gest Mrs. C. L. Benton of 406 Butter street,
Mr*. J. C. Young of 114 Cumberland street,
or Mrs. Ramsey, editor of the Pacific
Youth.
Mrs. Sarah d'Arinay, a neatly dressed,
quiet and good-looking woman, was sworn
und testified tiint she is theTnother of little
Ettie and iivcs in D;xon, in this State. She
had no Objection to letting Mrs. Martin
take the child provided none of the parties
in interest are permitted to visil tier pend
ing the hearing of the application for per
manent custody or adoption.
Judce Coffey said : "How about your
self? Will you also forego visiting the child
in the meantime?"
"Yes, provided MrÂ«. Holstrom is also
prohibited from seeing her," was the re
ply.
Mr. Deuprey commented somewhat se
verely on this, saying it might be Mrs.
d'Artnay's disposition toward the child,
but that Mrs. Holstrom had other and
more tender semirnents. fche wanted to
see the little one and minister to its
needs.
"Well, I'll allow both mothers to visit
the child at all reasonable hours." was
Judge Coffey's humane decision, and he
signed a uecree constituting Mrs. Martin
the legal guardian and custodian of little
Ettie until lurther order of the court. He
warned Mrs. Martin to be zealous in the
discharge of her duties and to guard her
charge well, for it is evident that Mrs.
Holstrom is a shrewd and d sperate
woman, that she has a great affection for
the child, and would obtain possession of
ihÂ« child by any means in her power.
Mrs. Martin retired to Judge Coffey's
chambers, when, in less than ten minutes,
ehe manifested litr litness for her position
as guardian by having the little one
laughing and romping among the law
books and transcrips on appeal and other
legal bric-a-brac that cumber the apart
ments. Both mothers were excluded, and
were told to call at the Girard House in
Oakland if they want to see the child. The

MARY LUCINDA HOLSTROM, Foster-Mother of the
Child, and MRS. MARY L. MARTIN, Appointed to Act
as Mother pro Tempore.
little girl's joy wh n told that she would
not hnve to go back to jail was unbounded.
Judge Coffey took a brief recess to enjoy
the result of his wi3<iom.
Just before the adjournment of court
Attorney Sweeney addressed Jud c Coitey
on behalf of Mr. Kane, who wished to
apologize to the court for his hasty words
to Mr. Deuprey.
Judge Coff >'V said he thought Mr. Kane
owed the court two apologies, for he not
only called Mr. Deuprey a liar within the
hearing of the court, but had assumed a
minatory attitude and had engaged in a
I second quarrel with that gentleman. He
reproved Mr. Kane for acting as if he
thought the Probate Court were a rousta
bout report, a piace for violence. He was
reminded of his duty as an officer of the
court, and was told that he (.uaht to keep
j his tenuier and practice eeif-control. He
I could not blame tLe papers for roportinc
1 these disgraceful fcenes. He blamed
those who created t tie disorder.
Mr. Kane expressed deep contrition and
asked forgiveness, whica was granted by
ihe Judge.
It was understood that the case is to be
transferred to Judge Slack's department
of the Superior* Court for trial, as Judge
Coffey announced that he would noi hear
it further.
ANOTHER SAD CASE.
Mrs. Emma Brown and Her Daugh
ter Catherine Mingle Their
Tears.
The case of the. guardianship of little
eight-year-old Catherine Brown, heiress
to considerable property, came up before
Judge Coffey late yesterday afternoon.
Some time ago letters of guardianship
were granteJ to J. C. Kane, and Attorney
Stoney attempted to have the order set
aside, as the mother, Emma Brown, a
widow, wishes to retain custody of her
daughter.
Attorney Sweeny contended that Mrs.
Brown is an unfit person to have the cus
tody of the little child, a beautiful girl of
about eight summers, with long black
ringlets falling gracefully about her shoul
ders.
The mother and daughter were in court
and mingled their tears in sorrow at the
prospect of being separated.
Judge Coffey said it appeared that the
mother signed the original petition.
Mr. Stoney thought this was a mistake
and promised to make an investigation.
Mr. Kane explained to the-couit that be
haii kept his ward in the Mount St. Joseph's
Asylum and that he had refined to let the
mother visit her daughter Sunday because
that is not the regular visiting day. He
was willing to let her visit the girl at
proper times.
The court could see no reason for chang
ing the original decision and confirmee
the letters of guardianship hitherto issued
to Mr. K>tne, but granted a stay of pro
ceedings for ten days.
This caused a misunderstanding on the
part of Mr. Kane, for as soon as he reached
the corn â or ne attempted to take poses
sion of the child, as he thought it was nis
duty to do under ihe order ot the court.
Tne little girl shrank from his touch in
terror ana ran sobbing to her mother.
This led to a consultaiicn between Mr.
Kane and Mr. Stoney, and tLey linaily
returned to Judge Coffey's court, where
Mr. Kane asked if he was not entitled to
the immediate possessd n of .his ward.
"At the enu of ten days," replied Judge
Coffey. ''And you may find it requisite to
carefully watch tim movements of the
niother in the meantime, or the chiid may
disappear," be added.
Mrs. Brown and little Catherine stood at
the door ot tUe courtroom as if transfixed
with dread while listening to the worils of
fate, for the truth was borne in on them
as never before that a jndce sitting on his
bench has the power oi life and death over
his iellow-men; that he holds their fate in
his hands.
When assured that they had ten more
days in which they may enjoy their mu
tual companionship they JJett t the room the
two happiest mortals in San Francisco.

ALLOTMENT PLAN
FOR UNEMPLOYED
Major Winchell of the Sal
vation Army Ex
plains It.
D. stric. and Special Committees
Do Some Rustling in
ths Rain.
Mayor Pbclan Will Shortly Inter
view Mr. Sutro R-garding the
Right-cf-Way Daed.
Major W. \V r . Winchell, tha superinten
dent of the Salvation Army Bccial depart
ment, has been very busy during the last
lew weeks perfecting the details of rhe
army allotment colonization scheme, by
means of which, it is expected, permanent
relief and a respectable livelihood will
ultiniaiely be assured to thesurpluspopu
lation of this and other California cities.
"Commander Booth-Tucker will be here
from the 18;h to the 23d," said the major
yesterday, "and on Monday, the 22d inst.,
will address a meeting at the Chamber of
Commerce and explain the details of the
scheme.
"The following evening he will address
an open social meeting at Metropolitan
Hall upon the same subject. He is just
now in Chicago on business connected
with the allotment plan, and will proceed
hence to Texas to inspoct some unoccupied
lands, which may prove suitable for a
colony. The citizens of Detroit have just
donated the armyj $60,000 worth of prop
erty, to be devoted to the colonization
project.. This is the most magnificent gift
we have received since the introduction of
the army into the United States.
"In order to put the allotment scheme
into operation, which we hope to do next
fail, certain preliminaries will have to bÂ«
undertaken. Tho .plan I have adopted is
this:
"I have made arrangements with large
land-owners in Sonoma and Contra Costa
counties to put a large force of men to
work at once clearing extensive tracts of
thickly wooded land. I have a house al
ready on the Sonoma tract suitably fur
nished and capable of accommodating 100
men. The price of their board will be
ta.ien out in iuniber, which the army
guarantees to sell in the fall and realize
buflicient to pay to men $1 50 a cord, and
perhaps more. Ten men can cut ten
Cord 3of wood a day, which means $1 50
per man a day. The army will supply a
superintendent anu & cook.
"I expect to send out my first batch of
fifteen or twenty men on Tuesday, and in
the meantime I am selecting the most
worthy and capable among the uuein
ploypd.
"When the summer comes i shall have
no difficulty in hndiug additional work for
a large number on ranches, harvesting,
gathering fruit, etc. The farmers and
orcharoists whom I have interviewed
assure me that they will alway* give
American labor the preference, especially
if the army will ruate its if responsible
for the good behavior of the men.
"All tnis leads up to our colonization
scheme, which, as I have said, we hope to
put into operation next fall. The army
already owns a 300-acre farm in Contra
Costa County and I am considering other
offers of exiensive tracts suitable for such
purposes, one in particular of 17,000 acres
in Tehama County.
"Mow, with proper economy, a propor
tion, at least, of the men, who meanwhile
have been engaged in clearing these
woodrd lands already referred to, should
easily have $150 or $200 to their creuit by
next summer, and 1 propose to offer them
â if i hey are airreeableâ ten acres of land
and so much lumber in lieu of a cash pay
ment. The unpjiid ba ance can he mude
good in rive years at a low rate of interest.
I believe that a house can be put up for
less than $100, If we have the mmber and
services of a capable master carpenter.
One hundred and fiity dollars, therefore,
would be ample to enable a family to
make a start of this kind, and with ordi
nary good management the cost of the
land shoul.i be entirely defrayed in a
year.
"The army, of course, will provide
proper instruction and supervision until
the colonists have paid for their holdings
and are sufficiently advanced to dispen-e
with both. We will also establish, a bank
Into which they can place their savings.
"We hope to establish 100 families in this
manner nrxi fall."
Three of the special and district rolief
committees were out in the rain yester
day, busily canvass-ing for subscriptions.
The committee composed of Lippman
Sachs, \Y. M. Bunker and H J. Crocfcer,
and ex-Mayor Ellen's committee, were
especially active and succeeded In raising
the fund'in the hands of Daniel Meyer to
$4112.
Circulars were sent yesterday to Super
intendent Ditrgett of the United States
Mintund to each of the principals of the
City schools, asking both the Mint em
ployes and the scho< Heachers to donate a
portion of their salary to the boulevard
fund.
The present inclement weather, though
It has undoubtedly interiered with the
work of the committees, has predisposed
the public to assist the unemployed by
accentuating the misery of the latter.
The only obstacle which it likely to pre
vent nn early commencement of work
upon the boulevard lies in ti.e conditions
contained in Mr. Sutro's deed conveying
thirteen acres of lÂ«nd to the City south of
the park. Mayor Phelan finds some con
ditions in the Sutro deed which he hopes
Mr. Sutro will set aside, and he will confer
with Mr. Sutro and will then try to pre
vail upon him to eliminate these obnox
ious clauses.
Yesterday's rain seriously interfered
with the comfort of the men at the arm
ory. The commissariat wagon did not
make its customary number of rounds for
the good an.l sufficient reason that very
few of the members of the organization
are sufficiently weii-shod to brave tne
fury of the elements. However, several
acceptable contributions were received in
the course of ihe day, among such being:
One hundred loaves of bread, ten porndg of
Caimy, fiity pounds of cornbails find a small
case of etjgs from W. S. Townsena, 627 Martiet
street ; eiK&t bundles ol clothing, containing
twenty suits of underclothing, shirts, 00l ars
and undershirts irom "Uncie Jacob's"; two
Diindlos oi clothing, from Mrs. Korn, 538
Minnn street; groceries from Mrs. Fred Killop
and, K. J. ShroeJor of Filimore Â§tretÂ»t; liny
pounds of beet from S. P. Hicks of the Bouuo
mitrkei; two sacks of flour, two boxes of toma
toes, saci of vegetables, twenty-five pounds of
bacon, two sacks of bread, and $10 CH.sh lroia
the ban Franti&co Trades and Labor Council.
The family relitf committee once more
calls attention to tli â¢ need of shoes of
every description, pants and undercloth
ing. The committee yesterday acted on
the Erady case at 605 Pine street. The
landlord, whose peculiarly inappropriate
name is Lovely, was determined to. eject
both man and wife unless a portion of the
ient were forthcoming. The committee
provided temporary accommodation for
Mr. and Mrs. Brady at 664)4 Howard
street. Mr. Brady, it may be added, is
bedridden.
Greor is an old man of 55 residing at
410J4 Valencia street. His wife was
striken quite recently and is suffering
from a complication of ailments. The
family have no money, nothing to eat, no
fuel and cannot pay the r^-nt. Greer
called at the prmory yesterday, and in
ppite of his years accomplished a good
day's work and subsequently carried a
sack of coke and a supply of provisions all
the w*y to his home on Valencia street.
Mrs. Cahillof 353 Dora street haa four
children, one of whom is at the point of
death as the result of diphtheria. These
are only a few of the cases that have re
ceived atsention at the hands of the com
mittee, but with the best will in the world
that body can do very little with the scant
resources at its disposal.
The organization generally appeals to
the charitable for donations in tvÂ« shape
of canvas to place at the bottom of the
sleeping bunks and quilts and Dlankets,
new or old. Deprived of thÂ»se necessaries
the men are frequently obliged to lie down
in their damp clothes at the imminent
ri^lc oi contracting disease.
Last night's concert at the California
Theater and the baseball game to-day
have interfered somewhat with the sale of
tickets for the benefit entertainment at
the Auditorium on Tuesday evening, but
the men wiil make another effort 10 get
rid of the balance in the interim.
Discussing the dollar a day proposition
of me citizens' relief committee, one of
the inÂ»moers of the family relief commit
tee thus expressed himself yesterday:
"Any man who will aslc another to work
for less than he himself is w lling to realize
as a profit on the sale of his goods, if he
be a merchant, has no piace in a com
munity where a semblance of justice pre
vails."

THE SINGLE TAX
IN NEW ZEALAND
Consul Connolly Says Its
Success Has Been
Proved.
First Law Passed During a
. Period of Deep Depres
sion in '91.
N w Manufactories Are Running Full,
Paying Grod W.gs and Pros
perity Is G;teral.
John D. Connolly is Consul to New Zea
land, the land that sia,zle-taxers point to
as tlieir object lesson. He was appointed
by- President Cleveland in his first term.
He was not displaced by Harrison and
; was reappoinied l>y Cleveland. He has,
there ore, been Id position durnÂ» all the
period that has seen the adoption of that
system of taxation which makes the near
est approach to that advocated by Henry
George.
Mr. Connolly has watched the move
ment with interest and id his report of
April, 1894, he records his observations
and conclusions concerninj its operations
and eftects. That report so quickened the
interest in the subject that his time and
energy have been severely taxed in
responding to a deluge of inquiries from
prospective immigrants, social reformers
and men of all conditions who were in
terested.
Not only that, but the department at
Washington lias been subjected to a sim
ilar strain, insomuch that it was forced to
call upon Mr. Connolly for a supplemental
report, giving further information and
carrying his observations on the same
iin?s down 10 the present lime. Tbis re
port has just been received and published
by the Treasury Department. It contains
much matter of mccv interest, especially
at this time, when the legislatures of rive
Stales, including California, are consider
ing amendments to the constitution look
inc to the adoption of the single tax.
The policy in New Zealand was inaugu
rated by John Ballance, who became
Premier in 1891. He was a man of great
ability and firmness and succeeded iti
winning public confidence to such an ex
tent that, as Mr. Connolly says, any
measure that he proposed was invariably
anopted. Prior to the passage of the first
act introduced by Ballance the country
had passed through a series of years of
the severest industrial depression, suc
ceeding a period of wild speculation, due
to the extravagant and wasteful expendi
ture of millions of money in building rail
roads and other improvements for which
there was no real demand and for which
the time had not com*'.
By the act of 1891 all personal property
and borne improvements were exempted
irom taxation. Two years later the act
was amended exempting all improve
ments. li\ thiÂ» way a change in the inci
dents of taxation was effected from a land
personal property and improvement tax
to a land improvement tax.
This change Mr. Connolly says is now
generally admitted to be a "beneficial
step," "was made with satisfactory re
iqlts," and altogether "demonstrated the
wisdom of abulisliing the improvement
tax."
.Referring to the manner in which this
legislation was at first received he saya:
Of course, as might naturally have been ex
pected, a cry ot alarm went up, and this class
oi legislation was condemned far and wide as
being revolutionary and un-English, and
those who favored such laws were denounced
as "socialists" and "spoliators." Be this as it
may, me people adhered to their sealed pol
icy, and the hand ot ihe clock has not been
turned back as yetâ the course ot legislation
still goes on.
And further on-he says:
Now, however, the people are rapidly begin
ning to realize the beneficial effects of the new
era that' had been inaugurated a few years
back and are becoming reconciled to the in
novations they were wont to condemn hereto
fore. .
And rgain :
The wisdom of the alteration in the inci
dence of taxation from land and personal
proporiy to land and income tax has now been
fully demonstrated.
Both me press and the people eeem recon
ciled to tiie present Fystem, but it hus taken
some time for the wealthy and well-to-do gen
erally to cease their opposition to the new
conditions.
Labor is relieved from taxation, except In
the matter of customs duties, toward which all
have to contribute.
In New Zealand the land and income tax is
now popular; it is accepted in lieu of tho
property tax; it is a success.
Speaking of the beneficial effects of this
legislation he says:
With the abolition of the property and im
provement tax for" state purposes improve
ments have improved very largely all over the
colony.
That the legislative innovations of tho im
mediate past u&vt) sbocked the sensibilities 01
a iarge number of well-to-do colonists is un
questionably true, but at the same time, as
against any inconvenience tin-y may lihve ex
perienced on this aci ount, there is the lact of
increased prosperity in nearly every branch of
trade ai.d industiia. life throughout the coun
try, Jarm produc.s are fetcniug satisfactory
prices, manufacturing industries are running
full time and paying good wages and lair in
ter-st on the capital invested, labor is remu
neratively employed. Interest on money has
lallen from 6 and 7 per cent to 4 ai.d 5 rer
cent (this of itself is sufficient to prove that
money is abund.tnt). Millions of En*riis:i cap
ital are flowing in ior the development of the
gold fields oi the colony and the creait oi the
country at no period of its history stood so
high on tiie English market as U does to-day.
1 may also mention tnai through, thegenu*
me encouragement given by the Government
to ihe small-i.irmer class the waste lands of
the country are being rupidly tRKen up
wherever lnnd is found suiUb c for farming or
grazing purposes.
John Ballance did not live to see the
beweticia. results of the legislation which
he inaugurated, but his memory is held
in grateful remembrance, and the work he
began has been carried forward by his fol
lowers, though not with that force and
ability that he would have brought to its
execniion.
Tlie recent lpgislation is more distinctly
single tax than that which has preceded
it. Consul Connolly in speaking of the
"new local bodies rating act on unim
proved values, passed July 10. 1896," the
last revenue act of the colony, says: "This
act should Elad'len the heart of the
average Single-tuxer' for the reason that
it goes a lons way iti that direction."
In his official roport he pays the single
taxers the compliment of attributing to
their persistent and well-directed efforts
the enactment of this important measure,
saying:
There are a large nura ber of single- tax advo
cates in tbe'oolony wno have been for a con
siderable time endeavoring to get some such
measure pas ed as a sort of entering wedge or
prelude to a more comprehensive scheme of
single tux, and I believe 1 am right in saying
it is to their persistent advocacy the passage of
this measure is maiuly attributed.

WHAT MANLY POWER DOES.
It makes your life happy, because it makes you feel that the great
est of nature's gifts has been preserved by you. V
It makes your nerves strong and gives you the sensation of true*
manhood. It makes you a power among men, because they recognize
in you a superior type of man. : . V ;;-f
'.:'â¢ It is worth while being a strong man, because not one in ten is
really, and truly free from the effects of habits formed in youth.
The man who is lacking in vital force is only half a man. He lacks
confidence in himself he is confused in ideas and slow of brain; his
sleep is unrefreshing, back weak, heart weak; he is really on the verge
of nervous collapse half the time, and' easily 1 ; gives way to temptations
and excesses; he is the man who needs such a remedy as
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT
Made and perfected for the care of weak men. In this it brings health
and happiness to all men who have wasted' the force of manly energy.
"Electricity is Life" to such men, and this famous Belt is the spring
from which all men may drink new power. V'
Manly Strength Restored.
' SAN FRANCISCO, December 28, 1806.
â¢ DR. A. vT. SANDENâ Dear Sir: A few months ago I purchased one of your
strong power Belts for vital and sexual weakness, disease of the kidneys and pain in
the back. i was suffering from pain to such an extent that I could not work and
could hardly sit down. The Belt has completely cured ! the pain and . the kidney
trouble and restored my manly strength entirely. 1 would not -be without the Belt
under any circumstances. Yours truly, :
CHARLES FORREST, 310 Twelfth street
â  Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is not an experiment. Cures like the
above have been reported daily for years. It is a positive cure for all
nervous troubles, whatever the cause. Why- do you not save the
money you pay. the doctors for three months' treatment and try some-
thing new ? Drugs are old and have proven useless for such troubles.
. It will. make you strong; it will steady your nerves and check all
waste of ; power in r thirty days. Its full force is directed to the weak
parts and the effect is magical. Cures of the worst cases are made in
two months. -rv :^'^^ \ . , ' ."
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
If not, call and examine this wonderful Belt. Test the powerful
current it gives and see how easily regulated it is. Don't be ignorant
of a remedy which may correct all the past mistakes and assure you
future happiness. Don't delay ;, act now. Get the book "Three

NEGLECTED, BUT HOPEFUL
People on the Mission Road Are
Moving to Secure Im- .
provements.
Mission F.v:-Mi c Improvement Club
Met Last Night and Voted for
Progress.
Mission road, one of the oldest thor
oughfares out of the City, is the last to
receive official recognition at the hands of
i the City authorities. ...
This is the complaint of the residents
and property-owners on that road, as ex
pressed at a meeting of. the Mission Five-
Mile Improvement Club herd at Liguri
Hall, last might.m ight. Mud several feet deep,
with an 1 oveitlow of sand and rock which
was washed down from the many cuts and
gullies on"the A south side of the road,
showed, that the complaint is not un
founded; â  .- ",â¢,â . v - .
Dr. E. X. Torello presided at tne meet
ing. He said that something would have
to be done by the club to awaken the City
authorities to the absolute necessity of
putting Mission road in a passable condi
tion. As it is, there is neither gas, water,
po ice protection nor protection against
tire.
There was not even an alarm box within
two miles of Lisuri Hall, which is about,
the renter of the inhabitable section.
Ths excuse offered by :hs Supervisors
when spoken to about tho neglect of the
section is, "Shortness of funds."
Dr. lorello considered ihis worse than
no excuse. The people have been paying
taxes into ihe City Treasury for the past
fur; y years upon acres of laud and ur>on
considerable psrÂ«onai property. Yet,
they h >ye their streets in a virgin condi
tion instead of any attempt to have them
improved.
These remarks were coincided in by the
members present.
The committee on streets reported that
it bad petitioned the Supervisors to repair
the bridge over Mission Creek, so that
the proper grade could be established pre
paratory to having the roadway payed
with bitumen; also that hydrants be
placed along re line of the road from
College Hill to Ocean View, and that the
Spring Valley Water Company be re
quested to place mains over the same.
A motion w;i- carried that the Super
visors be requested to grada and pave
Brazil avenue from Paris to Munich
streets, a distance ot five blocks.
F. J. Gilfeather moved that the Super
visors recommend an ularrn-box be placed
at the junction of Mission street and Sil
ver avenue. And also that the Market
street Railroad Company be requested to
erect a shed at the same place for the ac
commodation of the public, who are now
compelled to stand in the mud and rain
while waiting for a car. Both proposi
tions were uiianimousiy adopted.
Secretary M. H. Levy offered a motion,
which prevailed, that the pas company be
requested to put mains along Mission
street.
It is the intention of the Five- Mile Im
provement Club to have the Mission road
attendPd to in the near future.
The following are the ciub officers:
Dr. E. N. Torello, president; H. E. Doyal,
vice president; M. H. L a vy, recording secre
tary; F. J. Oilfeather, financial secretary; R.
Cereghino, treasurer; executive committee,

know, a-, well as those with whom' you will

THE WAR UPON
IMPURE FOOD
Associated Industries De
cide Upon a Course
â¢ of Action.
Determined to Pat a Stop to
the Sa'e of Adulterated
Predicts.
Will Find H w Fir the Law Can B?
Employed to Accomplish the
D.-sired R-su ts<
A meeting of the Council of Associated
Industries was held yesterday, at which
Julian Sonntag presided. The bodies rep
resented were the State Board of Horticul
ture, E. F. Adams and B. W. Rawley;
State Board of Trade, J. S. Emery and J.
A. Filcher; Mechanics' Institute, E. A.
Denicke; San Francisco Fruit Exchange,
Isidor Jacobs; Chamber of Commerce,
Charles R. Allen and L. F. Latresto;
Manufacturers and Producers' Associa
tion, J. W. Kerr, M. J. Keller and Oscar
Lewis.
The latter, who is a member of the pnre
food committee, stated that he had met
District Attorney W. 8. Barnes relative to
prosecuting those who are dealing in adul
terated food products. Mr. Barnes' letter
upon the subject was read. In thia he
stated that if every wholesale and retail
dealer in San Francisco who carries or
handles adulterateu food products should
be arrested, hundreds of respectable mer
chants would be put to this disgrace and
the couns would be clogged fora long time
to come.
Mr. Barnes' advise was tbnt the com
mittee should select one strong case and
that the offender should be prosecuted
through all of the courts, for such a case
would surely be appealed. In this way all
of the legal technicalities could be brought
out and argued and the prosecution could
at last secure a final and adequate decision
by a court of competent jurisdiction that
would show the scope and effect of the
act and the powers 01 the prosecution.
Mr. Barnes also suggested that a retail
grocer should be selected and arrested for
selling a single article or package. In
con jlusion he said :
I therefore suggest that, the simplest and
easiest way always being the Dest, the Jpure
food committee will, in my judgment, attain
the best results with the least cost and the
smallest amount of individual hardship by
proceeding upon the lines that I have indi
cated; especially, as I understand, that the
j object of this movement is not so much to
pu. ish dealers who may, innocently, have
! sold or handled aaulteratcd food products as
' it is to stop this traffic, drive bad goods out of
our borne market and protect the people from
the results of their own ignorance of the sani
tary conditions of the tood they take.
J. A. Filcher said that it would be well
to proceed upon the lines suggested by
the District Attorney.
Isidor Jacobs was of the opinion that
an aggressive campaign against all who
violate the law would be productive of
the best result!. He stated that the
efforts of the Board of Health in causing
many arrests have already caused several
of the local manufacturers of adulterated
food products to go out of that line of
business.
C. R. Allen and J. W. Kerr suggested
that many innocent retail dealers would
be made to suffer by pursuing a severe
couse.
E. F. Adams spoke in favor of making a
tes* case.
Mr. Kerr stated that the Council has
two objects in view. One is to see that
only pure goods are sold, and the other is
to preserve the reputation of California
goods. Many an Eastern firm is putting
up adulterated goods and marking the
nackases with California stamps. This
does California industries a great injus
tice.
B. N. Rowley stated that the wholesale
dealers do not desire to handle impure
poods, but are compelled to do Â«o by the
demand for cheap articles. Wholesale
dealers will gladly co-operate witn the
Board of Health in suppressing the sale
of adulterated and injurious foods.
After much discussion and several
amendments the council adopted the fol
lowing resolutions, presented by E. F.
Adams, as the policy upon which the
council will operate hereafter:
Whereas. It is well known that there Is an
extensive trade in imported adulterated food
products, which has grown up from n. desire to
supply cheap goods to those demanding them;
and, whereas, it is of the utmost importance
thai the community should be protected from
the use of adulterated food products deleteri
ous to the public h^mth, a duty which espe
cially devolves upon the Board of Health ; Â»nd,
whereas, it is of equal im;or;ance to the pro
ducers and manufacturers of this State that
California should become known to the world
as a State where it is not Dossible to buy ndul
terated food products, whether deleterious to
health or not. except as the adulteration may
be stated, therefore.
Resolved, That It shall be announced that it
is the policy of this council, by which we will
abide in the future, that we will oppose by
all 1-iwfiil means in our power the selling of
any adulterated food products whatever,
whether deleterious to health or not, except
under n name which shall disclose its true
composition. That to this end we will aid in
the prosecution of any party or parties under
arrest for the violation of any pure foo<l or
health law, whether resulting" in any ininrv
to the public health or not. That we affirm
as the principle by which we will be gu'ded in
causing prosecutions that the consumer has
the right to receive that product which he
orders and pays for, and that the person who
sells it should be held responsible for that de
livery, and that therefore we will, as represent
ing consumers, diree* our nttacks to the re
tailers who supply them and to leave to them
the duty of prosecuting tho jobbers and man
ufneturers from whom they may purchase
such goods.
The council decided to co-operate with
the Manufacturers and Producers' Asso
ciation in holding a State pure-food con
gress in the near future, the object of
which is to make arrangements all over
tne State for enforcing the laws rela
tive to adulterated foods. The date for
holding the congress is rot vet set. It was
also decided to in lorse the legislative bill
to appropriate $(>OCO to defray the expenses
of forwarding and installing a fine exhibit
of California products at the Hamburg
Exposition.
Pure Food Crusade.
The cases of Henry Rathjen, William
Cline, A. Qnade, Barclay J. Smith and
Charle? Fulirenberg, grocers, charged
with offering for sale adulterated food,
were called in Judcre Campbell's court
yesterday and continued till next Thurs
day. J. Levy, trrocer, was also arrested
yesterday on a similar charg*.

The storms of the past week have bad a
marked effect on the municipal campaign.
Candidat s have not been able to draw
people from their homes to sit in damp
hails and listen to dry speeches, and as
the men who are anxious to govern the
city for the next two years consider it ab
solutely imperative that the voters shall
know what they all think, the campaign
has developed during the past three days
into one of literature, which has flooded
the postoffice, tired the mail-carriers and
produced ennui in the voters and caused
tiie domesiics who have charge of front
doorsteps to imperil their fuiure by ex
pressing their opinions of office-seekers.
An actual count shows that twenty can
didates or part es have resorted to the
mails for tne purpose of getting their
views before the public. Judging by the
sodden missives that foot passengers have
been obliged to kick oat of their way on
the sidewalks, not more than one-half of
these packages of photographs, advice anil
theses have got past the uousehoiders'
doors.
There are about 9000 voters in this city,
and as it is the custom to transform the
great register into mailing lists on such
occasions as these, it is certain tbat not
less than 180,000 extra t>ieces of mail have
cone into the postoffice during the past
few days.
Much of this matter is still in the office,
ana probably borne of i; may be there after
the vutes are cast next Monday.
Although the Postmaster is personally
attending to the effort-' of his carriers and
seeing that each one does as much work
as possible, a strict limit is placed on bis
ambition. The Jaw expressly forbids car
riers working more than eight hoars a day,
and at the end of that time they must re
turn to the office and cease delivering.
The winds of tne past week have cer
tainly blo^n much good to local printers,
for never before was so much matter put
into type as during that periO'i.
The procession of canvas houses built on
buggies met with a serious mishap this
morning. A sudden hail s-quall seemed to
center at Eleventh and Broadway, and
the sirone wind pre-sed so heavily on the
canvas that the wagon was overturned and
all its colored advice wai laid in tbe gut
ter. The other wagons turned their horses'
head to tbe wind and saved being blown
over, but despite the animal's efforts to go
forward, there was a recession of proces
sion for a few minutes.
The anti-saioon crusade will be prose

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
STRUGGLE FOR THE
SOBRANTE GRANT
Victor Castro's Evidenc? Is
of a Most Startling
Nature.
D carfs That H- N^ver Bor
' rowed Money or Deeded Away
His Rights.
Records Show That He Did, but H
Denies That the Signatures
Are His.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, M.rch 6. )
Ten years ago a suit w:is brought by tha
late Edson Adams of this city to quiet
title lo the enormous Sobrante grant, sit
uated across the border in Contra Coata
County. The object of the suit is to parti
tion 20,000 acres or more of the Sobrante
amoiiii the different claimants who can
show a pood litle. All these years have
passed since 1885 without the case reach
ing a trial. But it is now beiu. heard in
the Superior Court of Martinez. Edson
Adams has died and his son is now acting
in the place of his father. A small army of
attorneys is engaged on t.* case. John
R. Glascock and C. E. Wilson represent
the heirs of Edson Adams, Victor Castro,
the original gramee, is represented by P.
G. Galpin, and other lawyers in the case
are: Messrs. Mhoon, Haieht, Ball, Rix
ford. Countryman, McGraw, Griffith, Sam
Bell McKee and Reed & Nusbaumer.
The testimony shows that in 1841 Gov
ernor Jean B. A^varado bestowed a grant
of land upon two brothers, Victor Castro
and Jean Jose Castro. The grant was the
famous Sobrante. Victor Castro is the ,
central figure of the suit; although he
must be 80 years of age be is so well pre
served that ne does not appear to be more
than 60. He lives on his homestead in
Pinole and during the trial he has Liven
testimony which has amaz?d some of the
attorneys. There is not among all the
surviving Spanish Califortiiana a mure in
teresting character tnan Victur Castro.
The grant was recognized as va.id by
the United States Land Commission, anii
the Castros set up a claim to about 70,000
acres. It was finally decided that the
grant did not include the surplus lying
around the edges of the original rive
ranches, but only a single body of land
lying oetween tnem.
Fifteen years ago a patent was issued
for the Sobrante, which filed the extent
st about 20,000 acres, located on the water
sheds of the San Pab^o Creek and Wildcat
Creek. Its present value is about $550,000
The tangle to the titie began t\tien the
Castro* gave notes secured by mortgages
which they failed to pay, and foreclosure
followed. Among the person* from whom
Castro botrowed money was Edson Adams
and E. W. Leonard, and both of tlie^e par
ties foreclosed and secured title by sher.ff
sale. John Wilson also loaned money to
Castro, and this c aim ip, supported by the
usual evidences, but old Victor Castro
when he went on the stand paralyzpd the
lawyers by asserting that be never bor
rowed any money and never gave any
notes or mortgages.
The old man, wnose ininrt spems to be
very clear, said that In 1856, when the
loans are ?aid to have been made, be was
worth $250,000 and was shipping beef cat
tle to San Francisco by schooner from
Pinole three times a week. The notes
witu his signature were presented to him,
but he denied ever signing them. Even
when a judgment on record lor $19,5,000
was sbown to him be calmly said that he
had never loriowed the money.
O'ber transactions were produced in
evidence, one of them being a deed to "he
whole Sobrante in 1857, executed by both
Castros to John D. Fnsbee and De Saido
for a consideration of $40,^.00.
The remaining interests were disnosed
of to Horace Carpentier and Edson
Adams.
In addition to these complications, the
mortgagees in many instances assigned
their claims, which were again assigned
until the complication of titles is now
more intrica c than any Chinese puzzle.
All told :he litigants number between 300
and 400. Some of them live on the lami
and are liable to be dispossessed, although
this will not occur for some years, as it is
impossible for the case to be decided ulti
mately by the Supreme Court without
many delays.
A deal of the fighting far posses
sion accompanied by bloodshed, winch
took pace in former years, was outside
the limits of the present Sobrante grant.
It was when the courts decided ihat Cas
tro could hoid only the -in^ie body of
SoDrante land and not the margins that
the latter lapsed into the public domain,
and upon these pieces took place those
bloody straggles which were so frequent
twenty years ago.
The trial of the case will occupy several
more weeks.
BUSINESS OF EVERYBODY.
The Christian Endeavor Convention to
Be ;t-ai!ii a Benefit to Alaraeda
County.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 6.â The Chris
tian Endeavurers of Ahtmeda County
have issued a circuiar in which they state
that the residents of this county are
vitally concerned in the coming gathering
of Endeavorers in San Francisco. They
believe that an hour in a fruit orchard is
a better adyertisement than a bundle oi
statistics.
"It was the earnest efforts and untiring
zeal of a few unselfish Alameda County
workers," it says, "that made it possib c
for California to secure the convention,
and now.it id to our interest to see that in
all of the many plans for the visitors a
day or two is provided for a visit to this
county." The circular then continues:
One plan offer< d is to arrange a grand ex
cursion on the Southern Pacific wlierety all
who desire to take the trip ui.iy trglv nan
opportunity to visit the interior, spending the
entire day and poing to lrvmgtou and' L-ver
more. This would mean the hearty co-opera
lion of the people residing in ihe count? , tne
railroad and tne city societ.es. It worna un
doubted,y be tne meaiiK of securing .-ev.-ial
hundred of the very beg! class of peop.e as iu
ture residents of the county.
The City Union has already named a com
mittte 10 arrange lor a grand floral fete to be
held in the streets of the c ty of Oakland on
Tuesday, July 13, the o) je< t bei g to impress
upon the visa ors theudvantnges i.ithisduniy

Alameda County's headquarters in Fan

of the most DOpular :n the City, and it will
be to the interest o tve y citizen to sec thst it

Hocieiies should benin m once :o canvass their

distribu ion to delegates, and in tuis Â«ay give
them an inkling oi wnai a paradise thecounty
renl y is to reside in.
The bur leu of this work will not fall upon
the members of ihe soc eiies altogether.
Every man who owns land is deeply interested
in securing settlers and the matter should bo
presented to them by one able to do it and
then be followed up with a request for either a
can subscription or donation of fruits io bo
used in interesting the visitors' to Fran
cisco in Alameda County. What Alameda
County needs to-day worse th>in any.hing else
is several thousand Christ a.i men i nd women
from the Eastern and Middle States to settic on
small hu.diags and cultivate the soil.
The directors of the Fabiola Hospital
stated to-day that they have decided to
forego their annual flower fete this year in
favor Â«>f the Endeavorers. The ladies
sate that in doing this they are taking
into consideration the thousands of vis
itors who will be on the coast during July
and August and the advantage to be
gained by united efforts to attract atten

WERE BUTCHERED.
They Made a Brave Fight
Against Odds and Killed .

MURDERERS MUST BE GIVEN
UP AT ONCE.
If This Was Refused the Islands May
Already Have Been Shelled
by the Japs.
"Spain will have to make reparation to
Japan for the murder of the Japanese
traders in the Carolines, or else there will
be trouble," said Captain Luttrell yester
day. "It was nothing more nor less than
a case of cold-blooded murder, and the
unfortunate Japs did not even get a right- j
ing chance for their lives.
"They were enterprising little fellows,
and after a few months' residence at j
Kueaei tney controlled the trade of the j
group and established a regular line of
schooners between the Carolines and
Japan. When at the height of their pros
perity the natives rose against them and I
every one of them was murdered. It is
said the Spaniards instigated the uprising,
but that I cannot vouch for.
"Now, let me give you my own private
opinion about the Japanese. I have no j
love for the little brown man, but as a I
fighter he can't be beaten. Every one of :
them made a fight for his life, and while
there were twelve Japanese dead, at least j
twice that number of islanders accom- *
panied them to the happy hunting- i
grounds before the sun set.
"It was an unpiovoked quarrel, and j
Japan will make Spain pay for the loss of i
life before the trouble is all over. Two !
gunboats were stationed at the Carolines i
when we left, and the proposition was to j
shell the villages the first week in January
unless the murderers of the Japs were
given up to the commander of the Japa
nese fleet. The Japanese will insist upon I
carrying their point, and Spain must give
in to her, as the Japanese are in force and
ready to enforce their demands."
Captain Luttrell had a bad quarter of
an hour at Taputeouea. The British Con
sul got after him because he had left "a
destitute person" on the islands and
wanted to fine him $100. Luttrell refused
to pay the fine, and took his agent and
trade aboard and cleared out.
A year aeo Captain Luttrell was in com
mand of the schooner Viking, and had as
a passenger Mrs. Broeder and her three
children. They wanted to join her hus
band and father in the Gilbert Group, but
when they reached Taputeouea they found
he was at Ponapi in the Carolines. The
German residents got up a subscription
for her, and she was sent on her way re
joicing. On her arrival at . Fonapi Mrs.
Broeder found that her husband had sailed
for San Francisco to join her there. Dis
appointed the second time the wife was
in despair.
All her money was gone and she did not
know where to turn for relief. The Brit
ish Consul finally came to her assistance,
and as there was a ship in port at that
time bound for Antwerp he shipped
her and the children as passengers and
gave her enough money to reach her home
in Saxony.
Carl Broeder, the husband, learned of
hit wife's whereabouts from Captain Lut
trell yesterday, and as soon as he can
â¢traighten out bis business here he will
â tart for Germany to find his wife.
"I took the woman to the Gilbert Group
as an act of charity," said Captain Lut
trell. "In order to accommodate her I
had to give up my room and bunk with
the mate. What became of her after she
landed at Taputeouea I only know from
hearsay. Consul Campbell has had it in
for me for a long time, however, so he was
glad of any excuse to fine me. He hau no
use for American traders anyway, and
harrasses them in every way possible.
"When he wanted to practice an imposi- :
tion on me, I simply took all my supplies
ana merchandise aboard and left the place.
Mrs. Broeder had very little money when
she left San Francisco, and when she

WERE IT NOT CALLED A JACKSON SQUARE.
HERE IS THE TRUTH.
The Malicious Lies of the "Examiner" Officially Refuted and Its
Misrepresentations Laid Bare.
SAN FRANCISCO, March Â£, 1897.
To the Editor: I desire to state that the printers who visited the International
Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers, Local No. 21, on Wednesday evening, March 5, 1897,
at Academy Hall, 927 Market street, showed no intent nor purpose to convey the impres
sion that they in any way represented Typographical Union No. 21, of the International
Typographical Union, but merely that they were individual members of The Call chapel,
with no delegated power, and that they visited us for the purpose of correcting a mis
statement. _ ,
I also desire to state that the same gentlemen appeared before the Building Trades
Council on Thursday night, and they were extended the courtesy of the floor in a like
manner to that of the meeting of the Metal Workers, and they conducted themselves in a
like manner.
I also desire to state that no resolutions were passed by the Building Trades Coun
cil on Thursday evening, March 4, 1897, condemning or censuring any newspaper or pub
lication. H. C. HINCKEN, President Building Trades Council.
W. M. PAGE, Secretary Building Trades Council.
Mr. Page also made the following statement:
"I wa"s present as one of the delegates of the Building Trades Council at the meet
ing held at 91$ Market street on Thursday night, March 4, 1897, and as an individual and
not as a representative of that body I will state a resolution was presented by J. W. Rose
in substance the same as the one passed by Carpenters' Union No. 22, which he asked to
have the Building Trades Council adopt. The council decided not to take action and re
ferred the matter to the several unions affiliated.
"The statement made in this morning's Examiner that the council indorsed th ose
resolutions and condemned The Call is false and without foundation in fact. The coun
cil passed this matter without any action whatever. Therefore, the council cannot take
any action whatever until the several unions take action on the matter, to which all such
must be referred.
"I make this statement voluntarily, in order to correct any injustice that has been
! been done to The Call, that has always been friendly to labor and workingmen."
An instance showing to what extremes the Mission-street faker will go came to light
last nighÂ£ two representatives of the Examiner called upon Joseph Walters, the Secretary
of theTjnited Brewery Workmen's Union, with a view of obtaining a condemnation of The
Call, but they ran against a snag in Walters who manfully answered;
"Under no consideration will I bring such a matter before my union. I have no
I reason to question The Call's fairness to the laboring people. The explanation of why
those resolutions were not published is sufficient for me and for any fair-minded man. In
the past The Call has maintained a friendly attitude to those who labor with their hands
for a living. Its reports of union matters, even in times of great trouble and when the
workingmen were sorely distressed, were invariably fair, impartial and the most accurate
of any of the daily papers of this City. It would ill become me or the union of
which I am a member to condemn a friend of any kind, and particularly a paper that,
as I said, has, so far, been the fairest and most accurate in its reports of labor union
matters."
failed to meet her husband, what little she
had soon disappeared.
"The next time I Tislt the Gilberts, I
hope there will be a representative of the
United States there to take care of our
trading interests, and the next time l visit
the Carolines, well I wouldn't be a bit sur
prised to see the Japanese flag flying from
the Government House in Ponapi."

A Heavy rainfall failed to keep away the
music-lovers of the City from the Trebelli
matinee at Golden Gate Hall, and well
were they rewarded, for Mademoiselle
Trebelli excelled herself. From the mo
ment she appeared she seemed thoroughly
in touch with her audience. Encore after
encore was demanded, and after bowing
three and four times she was finally com
pelled to accede to the persistent de
mands.
The bolero from Verdi's "Vepres
Biciliennes" was the most important
work done and elicited round after round
of applause. For an encore she sang the
"Laughing SonfÂ»," "Eclat pour Rire"
from Auber's "Munon Lescaut."
Miss V. Schorcht played Vieux

One of the most important communica

tile:
Sa>- Francisco, Cal., March 6, 1887.
Mr. Chairman awl Members of the Cuban Com
mittee of Fijty-eightâ Gentlemen: Ar. a regular
meeting 01 me Democratic Central Club, held
at Knights oi Pytnias Hall on Thursday even
ing, the sth inst., a committee was appointed
to draft resolutions indicating a sympathy
with and a desire to co-ooerate with the
Cuban Committee of Fifty-eight, which was
to convene the following evening by order of
Hon. Charles M. Shortridge, chairman, with
John H. Jones secretary.
In accordance with instructions the com
mittee have prepared the following report to
their club, with the understanding mat it
should be submitted here this evening to
be made a part of the proceedings:
Whereas, We, the members of the Demo
cratic Central Club of the City and County of
San Francisco, believing as we do in the in
alienable right of one people to shake off the
political bauds which have bound them to
another when such bands have become op
pressive and destructiveÂ©' material prosperity
and civil and religious liberty, we deem it the
common duty of every American citizen to ex
tend his full sympathy to such a struggling
people; and whereas, we are in daily receipt
of news through the public press of atrocities,
some of which are 100 inhuman for publica
tion in detail, against a people who are pour
ing out their iife blood f<>r freedom from the
arbitrary rule of an effete monarchy, as did
our ancestors more than a century ago, we be
lieve that Cuba, the queen of ttie Antiliies,
should have the full moral aud physical sup
port and aid oi the greatest Republic the
world has ever knownâ the United States of
America ; therefore
Resolved, That the Democratic Central Club
hereby expresses its willingness to co-operate
with the Cuban committee and all other bod
ies having in view the establishment ot the
autonomy of Cuba and the recognition of the
so-called insurgents of that island as a govern
ment de jure as well as de facto; further
Rcsoved, That our Representatives in Con
gress be requested to use their best efforts to
accomplish the letter and spirit of the above
resolution ; further
Resolved, That we extend our heartfelt
thanks to the American press for the manly
stand it has taken in behalf of freedom and
"Libre Cuba."

SAILORS TO CELEBRATE.
fcor Yesterday Was the Thir

Their Union.
Exercises Postponed One Week on
Ac-ount of the Inclemency of

The Sailors' Union of the Pacific intends
to have a jolly time in celebration of the
thirteenth anniversary of its existence on
Saturday evening next. For that matter,
everything was programme for last even
ing, but the rain god stepped in and
* polled all the fun â habit peculiar to
'â  hat erratic deity.
Just thirteen years ago a few old sailors
fathered at the foot of Folsom street, near
& pile of lumber, and there in the open
fir, with the cool salt breeze blowing in
|om the bay, formed what is known as
tfie Sailors' Union of the Pacific. It en
sured, and after some time a three-story
!^ick structure was erected at the corner
if Mission and East streets as headquar
ters. : ; . â  - \ -â ' " ' '
f There are now about 250 members in the
Union, and it is divided into two compa
niesâA and B. : Every year the ? birth of
the union is fittingly celebrated,' and the
annual event is one in which the members
always take a keen interest. j /
First the members. will gather at the
hall on the corner of East and Mission
streets. From there the line of march will
be to , the,: foot of Folsom-street wharf,
â¢where v the : organization', was founded.
I'.ree cheers will be given on this historic
tVot. : * ; . â -/:â "â :,â :â â â :. .-'';â .: ' ,
Then, with torches flaming and banners
fliuinting and a band playing the familiar

turning at length,' to the hall, ; where a
programme of literary i exercises will be
Tied out. Among the speakers on the
occasion will be Editor James H. Barry.

NOT A GREEK
BUT WOULD GO
The King's Call to Arms
Deeply Stirs Local
Patriots.
Members of the Reserve May
Hasten to the Scene of
Action.
The Hellenic Society Will Hold an
Emergency MeetiDg to Discuss
the Situation-
The local Greeks are deeply stirred by
tne intelligence that the Greek Minister
of Foreign Affairs has cabled to the act
ing Grecian Minister at New York in
structing him to call out the members of
the Grecian reserve in the Unitert States
and to urge them by every means to go to
the assistance of their native country.
There is not a single able-bodied Greek
in San Francisco who would not respond
to this call with alacrity if he were able to
do so. Unfortunately for any immediate
practical evidence of patriotism, most of
the members of the Greek colony are poor
and have not the means at their disposal
to carry them back to the old country.
In this dilemma they chafe angrily, and
are now trying hard to devise some feasi
ble scheme to defray the necessary trans
portation expenses. There are probably
about fifty members ot the reserve in this
City, but that number does not include
those others who, though they have never
served in the ranks, are capable of carry*
ing a musket. There is some possibility
that the wealthy Greeks, of whom there
are many in other parts of the United
States, will rise to the spirit of an inspir
ing occasion almost unparalleled in the
annals of modern European history, and
create a fund which will enable their war
like countrymen to obey this call to arms.
The money recently raised by the
Greeks in tnis City was designed to help
the widows and orphans of murdered
sires in Crete, and cannot be diverted
from that noble object. As soon as tne
proceeds of the Greek ball have been esti
mated and added to tat sum previous. y
raised by voluntary subscription the total
will be forwarder to the Metropolitan
Bishop of the Greek cuurch at Athens
and by him distributed.
The Hellenic Mutual Benevolent So
ciety will hold an emergency meeting on
Wednesday evening, the 10th inst., and
disctiss the situation.
"We feel," said A. J. Kosto last
night, "that something shou!d be done
and done quickly. Every Greek in the
City feels that his country needs him, but
without money what can he do? A few,
it is true, possess a little property, and
these will, no donbt, try to sell it as soon
as possible and hasten to the scene of
action. The whole colony is deeply stirred
by this intelligence and will leave no stone
unturned to obey the call of their King
and country. There are many here who be
long t^ the army reserve and would" joy
fully don their uniforms again in antici
pation of striking a decisive blow at' the
power of the hated Ottoman.
"The Hellenic Society will do its best to
promote this patriotic determination, and
in the course of tfce next few days we may
be able to report something definite."
Stole a "Poor" Box.
Minnie Norton, a girl 16 years of age, was
arrested some months ago along with another
girl for stealing the poor box from St. Francis'
Church, Vallejo street. She was not punished
on her parents promising to send her to some
friends in the country. Minnie remained
away for a few months, but returned to the
City, and last night Secretary Kane ol the
Pacific Coast Society for the Suppression of
Vice and Policeman Coieman arrested her and
booked her for some pubic institution.

IF~^ 'QUIPPED with a static machine to
Ira.-*""'' - elierate electricity, a Crookes tube
JLii^^ of unusual size and novel in some
respects for the production of the X rays,
and various minor and accessory appli
ances, Dr. M. J. Woolf is conducting in
ibis City in a laboratory a series of experi
ments having in view a complete demon
stration of something new aiike to medi
cal and electrical science. His central j
idea is that it is possible with the X ray,
and solely through the agency of that
mysterious ray, to convey through the
tissues of the human body medicines of
curative properties.
Dr. Woolf goes so far as to say that he is
certain that this is so and that he has
demonstrated such to be the fact. It is j
not the purpose of this article to deny nor ;
to affirm that Dr. Woolf's conclusions are
correct. His idea and claims are, how
ever, so distinctly original that some facts
are given which are derived partly from
observation and partly irom Dr. Woolf's j
statements. These are submitted for
what they are worth with the confident
expectation that they will pique scientific
interest and perhaps promote investiga
tion in the general direction in which Dr.
Woolf's experiments lead.
For many years, and perhaps many cen
turies, the idea has been prevalent
in different portions of the globe that the
rays of the sun possess not only the
power to vivify, but that also they afe
healing agencies when properly applied.
Solan'oms have bien instituted in con
nection with hospitals and elsewhere for
the purpose ot affording patients a chance {
to reap such beneficial resu.ts from sun !
baths as could be brought. Coupled with i
the theory of the penetrating nature of |
sun rays has coexisted the practice of !
anointing with various drugs or chemi- j
cals tor sun rays to act upon directly or !
through thicknesses of glass. If benefit is !
received' in solariums, and those benefits j
are traceable or at least reasonably to be j
attributed to sunbeams or sun-rayy, :
several questions naturally occur at once j
to the lay mind and the scientific mind.
What rays are these which possess tbe â 
penetrative and curative power? Surely,]

?_ l -'A-HE spicy peppers have grown tall, |
/{.A have branched, have bloomed and
jjy* fruited into aromatic shower
clusters of scarlet berries, these many
years, alone the streets of beautiful Los
Angelesâ John C. Fremont first took I
up his headquarters in that low adobe
house standing now in a populous re.-i- i
dence district of this city. By a pretty, j
even if not strange, coincidence, the pep- j
pers have grown tall, too, before that other j
homo which, after many years, is destined
now to be that of the Deloved wife of the
explorer's youth, Jessie Benton Fremont.
Tnis name, so cloriously written upon
the paces of history of the entire country
as well as that of early Ci lifornia, is not
unfamiliar to a younger generation wLich
has read in history of thai Presidential
campaign in 1856, when the followers of
the Republican standard took off their
hats and shouted for its candidate for
chief executive, John C. Fremont, "the
Pathfinder," and then cheered for his
beautiful wife, the lovable woman who is
now spending the evening of her life
within view of the scene of some of the
most thril ling incidents in her husband's
eventful career. As she sits in her lovely
home amid beautiful California flowers
to-day, and discusses the changes through
which the Government has recently gone;
as she reads of the inauguration of a new
President of the Nationâ she hears the
echoes of those che-rs, thinking, as a pol
itician thinks, after long years of trained i
thought, of the country's perils and the
country's needs in the past and at the
present.
But broader and more beautifully, she
thinks as a woman, of the wives of Me-
t Kinley and ot Bryan, even without parly j
preference, knowing as but few women do i
among the millions of women in this great
Republic just what it is to be the wife of
a Presidential candidate, one of those few
who, through a glorious if seemingly al
most endless summer have looked for
ward to that day so full of meaning to all
Americansâ the 4th of every fourth
November,
And oh last Thursday, the day of Presi
dent McKinley's inauguration, she could
fully realize and sympathize with the con
flicting emotions of these two women wj.o
had passed through the soul-harrowing,
some will say. they are not the heat rays !
nor the ordinary light rays. Dr. Woolf
thinks they are the mysterious ultra-violet
rays, which are known to have, he says,
capacity to penetrate. "Why," so he has
reasoned, "cannot these ultra-violet rays,
in other words the action of the sun rays,
be intensified so that in a few minutes as
much may be effected as could ordinarily
result after many days?" In his experi
ments, lending to demonstrate thai his
conclusions a-* to the actual facts are accu
rate, Dr. Wooif has employed the appar
atus which has already been roughly
enumerated.
The static machine is a very large af
fair, driven steadily by water-power and
yielding an unfailin Â» supply of electricity,
the conditions being those of the alter
nating current. At a distance of a few
feet, connected directly with the static
machine by thoroughly well protected
and thoroughly insulated wires, is a
Crookes tube of very large size, supported
on a standard. It is through the
Crookes tube that Dr. Woolf focuses so
to speaK the ultra-violet rays upon the
subject of his experiments. The produc
tion of the X ray directly from the static
machine without any intervening coil or
battery is a factor which Dr. Woolf con
siders unique and valuable.
The remaining conditions are easily de
scribed. The class of chemicals most
easily caused by the X ray to penetrate
the human system are roughly described
as crystalloids, nor will Dr. Woolf be more
specific in alluding to them. In addition
to the X ray tbe subject is able to become
thorouguly electrified, so that a spark can
readily be taken from any part of the
body. The electric current passes in
through an insulated stool,, upon which
the feet of the subject rest. The first evi
dence of complete electrification is the
unmistakable tendency of the subject's
hair to stand upon end. The subject,
judging by the experience of the writer,
does not experience any particular sensa- I
tion while he is becoming electrified.
The wires, carefully insulated, neverthe- |
less give out much electricity, leakage,
I and thi3 was fully determined by the I
uncertain days ol the last Presidential
campaign as the wives of the candidates.
She could apprec ate, in part, the feeling
of pride in her husband's achievement
that filled the breast of Mrs. McKinley;
and she couid appreciate still more fully
the regretful sorrow that must have per
meated the breast of Mrs. Bryan, when
she read of the triumphal entry of her
husband's late opponent into the National
capital; for the same feelings bad been
hers on one similar occasion just forty
years ago to the day.
But those memories have lost, I fancy,
somewhat oi their power to stir the quiet
of that sweet old lady, who rests and #
dreams in the languorous beauty of her
southern garden and enjoys only the
golden reflection of -hose dazzling days
without their jnr and discord.
It was in this mood 1 found her one
warm fragrant evening. She lives in
Adams street, that part of Los Angeles
remarkable for its fair homes, made fairer
by the luxuriance and charm of tropical
gaidens. Magnolias overshadow the fresh
lawn, orange trees and fan palms gather
the perfumes In their cooler masses, and
the graceful, willowy pepper flings out its
scarlet, bead-strung clusters to every pass
ing breeze, all conspiring to make beauti
ful the spot which bhe has chosen for the
home of her dec ining years.
She was sitting in her pretty reception
room, its windows thrown open to the
dewy night, so warm and wooing in this
southern latitude, and she herself as warm
and wooing as the air. Her daughter was
with her, and a friend â some very dear
friend, who proudly professed her love as
she arose to go. Everything and every
body seems to love Mrs. Fremont.
And then followed a most delightful
evening, for Mrs. Fremont has seen so
many pi.ases of lite and has fathered
around her such a store of reminiscence
that she is a charming conversationalist
and a delightful entertainer. She talked
of a fashionable wedding in Washington
at which she appeared in all the glory of a
bridesmaid when she was but 15; she told
of Her travels in Europe, of her journey
ings to the Golden State in the early days
of California to join her aaventur us hus
band, and of many other incidents of her
life that were highly entertaining. i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
writer, who took sparks from different
points on tbe insulated wire*. The air dur
ing the experiments is undoubtedly in ac
tive and rapid vibration. Every atom in the
bo iy of the subject is insensibly affected
by the electricity. Perhaps this molecular
activity is largely a factor.
The X ray concentrating.suppontitiously
at least, beneficial rays of the sun and
directing them to the anointed part, is
produced by the static machine without
the evolution of any heat in" the Crookes
tube. The rays generated are so powerful
that it is possible to see through the abdo
men at a distance of eight feet. The ab
sence of heat is in accordance with
acknowledged electric theories, because
there are no calorific effects in the gener
ation of energy by the static machine.
Dr. Woolf says that "Whether the static
machine has anything to do with the
effect of the X rays in carrying medicine
into the system is, of course, a matter for
conjecture. Certain it i* that the X rays
will not produce the effect alone. The
static machine causes the atmosphere to
be penetrated for several feet around with
electricity which may possibly cause a
molecular disturbance in the flesh tissues,
so that the rays can do the work of carry
ing the medicine. This can, however,
only be determined in the future.
"My discovery was made only a short
time ago. It may be summed up simply
in this, that the mysterious radiance in
passing through flesh tissues is capable of
carrying with it certain particles. These
particles can be in the form of certain
chemicals, which are carried directly into
the system, and should there be a diseased
part it will purely be reached and a cure
can be effected. That this can be done I
have in a number of cases fully demon
strated. I simply have anointed the
skin over the diseased or painful part and
then subjected it to a few minutes' ex
posure under the X ray, and that is all
there is to it."
Dr. Woolf Is young. He is an enthusi
astic electrician and physician. He firmly
believes that he has discovered something
new in electrical application, as his re
marks indicate. There is no doubt that
his claim will be vigorous!}' discussed.
But none of these were as interesting as
the story she told of the courtship of Gen
eral Fremont and of her romantic mar
riage to the explorer. She met John C.
Fremont in the very late thirties. Fre
mont was then a second lieutenant of en
gineers in the United States army and was
engaged in a survey of the territory that
lay between the Missouri and Upper riv
ers. The your.g officer was introduced
into the home of Colonel Thomas H.
Benton, then United States Senator from
Missouri, and at first sieht, according to
his confession to the young lady after she
becamo his wife, fell deeply in love with
Miss Jessie Benton, the second daughter
of t c Senator, and then a young girl but
15 years old. The young lieutenant proved

Some Rich and Rare Memories of "The Days of Old"
When Colonel John C. Fremont, "Jhe Pathfinder/ Pitched J"lis Tent on the Qround
Where the Palace Hotel NoW Stands
to be an ardent wooer and at once began
to press his suit. The object of his affec
tions looked favorably upon his wooing,
but the parents of the young lady seriously
objected to his attentions to their daughter. I
Colonel Benton was vehement and out
spoken in his opposition to young Fre
mont's suit. He declared thai his daughter
should not wed an army subaltern. He
declared that the army was not a profes- I
sion; that an officer's income was only a
salary that ended with his life, leaving his
widow a helpless ward of the War Depart
ment. Mrs. Beaton's objection to Fre
mont's suit was based upon the extreme i
youth of her daughter. Both father and
mother expressed the greatest personal
regard for the young lieutenant, but they
were determined, lor the reasons they
gave and which they considered all suf
ficient, that he should not wed their child.
But the soldier-lover was persistent. He
told the father of the young girl he loved
of his ambitions; how he intended to rise
above the rank of a simpie lieutenant of
engineers and make for himself a name
that should be illustrious; but to all the
young lover's pleadings the father turned
a deaf ear, and would often become impa
tient at the young man for his persistence.
It was during the summer of 184 L, while
young Fremont was endeavoring to over
come these impediments that had been
placed in the way of his marriage, that he
received a strange but emphatic order
from the War Department to make an ex
amination of the Dcs Moines P.iver, then
upon the extreme frontier and upon whose
banks the hostile Sacs and Fox Indians
made their homes. The order was a
'strange and mysterious one, but it was in
exorable. The young lieutenant and his
sweetheart suspected that the idea of send
ing him into such distant territory eman
ated from Colonel Benton, who hoped that
during the long absence of the soldier
his daughter might be weaned away from
what he considered a mere infatuation of
hers.
There were but two courses open to
young Fremont â to obey the order or
throw up his commission. He was a
soldier and he obeyed orders! With the
best spirits he could command Fremont
set out upon his perilous expedition. He
discharged his duty with jo much credit
to himself that, the gallant soldier return
ing not only found the loyal heart of his
lady love awaiting him, but an appoint
ment to explore the Rocky Mountains
and also to find a new emigrant trail to
the Great West.
Soon after the young officer's return to
Washington on the 19th of October, 1811,
he and Miss Jessie Benton were quietly
wedded in Washington. Colonel Benton
and his wife soon became reconciled to
the marriage â so soon, that the very next
year the colonel intrusted his 12-year-old
son, Randolph, to the care of Fremont as
his companion during his expedition to
the Rocky Mountains.

ripples with laughter when her lieutenant,

Nor does she leave them with a plain wed
ding-ring and an equally plain future.
Step by step she paces out for them a

The year after his marriage young Fre
mont bade his youthful bride farewell and
started on his perilous expedition to the
Rocky Mountains and began a career
marked by hardships and vicissitudes, but
which finally earned for him the fame of
being a Presidential candidate and the
name of "Pathfinder."

these bygone troubles of Mrs. Fremont
have made her broader and sweeter and
betier. Her soft, glowing whi'.e hair is
brushed away from a brow serene and
tranquil, and her bright, steady eye and
beautiful smile are but tempered with a
trace of that experience which has swept
through her life only to ennoble ir.
Her daughter, Mis? Elizabeth Fremont,
whose share of experience in those event
ful years was not a little, gives many
lovely pictures ot her mother; brief
glimpses, it is true, but touched always
with that steady lighting of strength and
sincerity so characteristic and so admira
ble. '"We had a rare opportunity to test
our patience once," she said snjilingly,
after finishing a bit ot personal history.
"Our camp at one time, just a group of
tents, was pitched on the present site of
the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.
"The City then was made up of the worst
and the best elements â the quiet, peace
loving old padres and the habitues of the
hundred gambling dens. Sprinkled in be
tween these two were tne miners and pros
pectors, men of all grades and types, out
of which sprang trio manhood of our
present day. Once when my mother was
very ill, we attempted to buy for her some
egss with which to tempt her apj etite.
The market price was $12 a dozen, but at
this particular time the possessor of such
a luxury would not part with thpm for
thrice that amount. In vain be was
offered again and again an ever increasing
price, but be stubbornly refused to sell.
Suort.'y after these hopefe3S negotiations
were abandoned our untempted eggiuan
was not to be found ; but Â©re long he ap
peared at tiie door of our tent, beaming
like the full moon with smiles and bright
ness, and in his most elegant manner
kindly presented a little package of eggs
to mother â all he had.
"But the beauty and glory oil abont us
compensated much for our deprivations.
I remember of traveling by wagon from
the bay country to Manposa through
scores of mile?, level as a floor, and all
overflowed with bloom. In our white
covered "schooner" we crossed the San
Joaquin Valley, its great expanse blue
and billowy as the sen from masses of
azure blossoms. We seemed absolutely
to swim up into the dimiy outlined hori
zon, where the blue of world and sky
met."
Mrs. Fremont published a book several
years ago under the title of "Souvenirs of
My Time," in which she recounts most
graphically the most striking incidents of
ncr eventful life.
The name of Fremont will always be in
separably connected with the history of
California. The old Californianâ it dogs
not matter which kind â he who used to
talk of Pike County, or of baked beans, or
he who still talks of tha time when the
water came up to Montgomery street â the
old pioneer, I say, is proud of the Cali
fornia Battalion, and we, iss native 3 , are
proud of it, too. We honor them, those
fine old pioneers, who wern so solid for it
and for its leader, John C. Fremont. But
1 venture to say there is another kind of
California battalion to-day â a more quiet,
perhaps smaller, but none the less loyal
company â out for the election to leader
ship of such as this one of California's
dearest women, she who shared the vi
cissitudes of the State and Nation, the
daughter of the Senator and the wife of
the candidate â Jessie Benton Fremont.

Among Historic Monuments in the Beautiful, Picturesque Valley of the Avon
PBiHE chief attraction of Bournemouth

jlfcK usual number of lungs, legs and
eyes â is that it is such an excelled*., start
ing point for innumerable excursions, by
train, by coach, by carriage or wboel and
even on foot if there are any who are not
too proud to travel so humbly.
For a breatn of th-i deep pine-scented air
of the New Forest, for a quick glimpse of
the Valley of the Avon, with Christchurch
and Christchurch Priory, it is well to
patronize the coach.
It is quite an imposing coach that stands
in the square in Iront of one of the big
hotels, with four well-groomed horses un
der gleaming harness, a coachman in
livery on the box and a footman behind
to manipulate the horn, and sometimes,
as a final touch of luxury, a tiny long
coated postillion.
It is a clear, light morning as we start
down the street, with a jingle of bells and
a jovial cracking of whips and a blast from
the horn that reverberates among the
hills. Before many minutes pass we are
out of the streets i;i the pine avenues,
rattling down the road ;it a pace that
speaks weli for our pro^reÂ«s through the
day's rich programme. A half hour's
drive, over the rough, wet roads, with the
flooded fields on either side; the whoie
country involuntarily converted to a Dutch
landscape â brings us to our first destina
tion. Chnstchurch Parish consists of the
Priory, the ruins of the old feudal castle
and castle keep, the little Norman bridiie

original church is, or just when the town
was started, is a matter cf interest to anti
quarians. The placo is mentioned in the
Saxon chronicles, and the earliest men
tion of the Priory is in the Domesday
Book. It was presented to the architect,
Bishop of Durham, Kahh Flam bard, by
William 11, and the monks had many
a curious legend as to the building of the
church. The verger, who is a rare exam
ple of his kind, and is young, interesting,
and talks like a college- brtd man, smiles
as he relates that originally another site
â was chosen, but every night the day's
labor was destroyed and the stones re
moved Jo the rising ground between the
two streams, the Avon and thÂ» Stour. At
last they determined to continue on the
spot to which the heavenly finger pointed,
as 500,000 franc?, that arc the usual accom
paniment of every public undertaking in
France.
When the funds from this source are
exhausted a treasury loan is to be made
guaraweed by the entrance fee?.
The site selected lies on both sides of
the Seine from the Pont de la Concorde
down to some distance below the Pont
1 d'Jeaa.
In the northeastern part on the Champs
Elysees are the gates of entrance and the
Palaces of Fine Arts. The ground chosen
for these latter was occupied in part by
the great Palace of Industry erected some
years ago. This has ueen razed, and
palaces 2 and 3 are to be erected in its
place. Tne entrance to No. 2 will be the
grand entrance to the exposition, by which
all public and ctlicial visitations will be
made.
The grounds bave been inclosed by a
high palisade fence, and there is to be no

and this lime they were assisted by those
determined spirits who had first foiled
them.
A supernumerary workman was ob
served to toil during the hours of labor,
but he exhibited a most unusual indiffer
ence to his meals am! his wages, thus sat
isfying the roo-t incredulous that lie must
have been heaven-sent. A beam that was
too short was lengthened a whole foot, and,
in fact, so marvelous was the assistance
of this incorporeal workman that popular
belief could only attribuie it to the most
direct personal intervention, and the edi
tice was dedicated to Chris:. There is a
continned list of priors from 1150 to 1539,
when King Henry VIII obtained posses
sion of it and granted it to the wardens
and inhabitants of Christchurch forever.
I However much that august monarch sev
! ered himself and his people from Rome,
ithe church has all of the characteristics
and some of the grandeur of the great
cathedrals. An avenue of elm?, gaunt
: and twisted and leafless and black, leads
to the north circle, in the center of which
S is the wide pointed arch which forms the
' direct entrance to the church. In olden
! days it was called the Galilee. Here the
! prior was wont to sit at an oaken table to
| sign and seal all the secular documents â
bills for wax alar lights, or marriage cer
tiheates, or deeds of land.
The interior is a marvel of discolored
I stone. The roof is of timber and must
j originally have been paintud, aa were the
capitals of the columns that here and
there bloom in a little cluster of brilliant
marring the beauty of the adjoining j
grounds or disturbing the convenience of
the public by the cartage of old and new
material up and down the avenues. This
will be done t-ntirely by underground
railways. The accompanying cut shows
the first stroke oi work in the construc
tion of the railroad from the grand pal
aces 2, 3 and 4 to the Seine, by means of
which everything is to be handled by
boats on the river.
One of the most interesting and instruc
tive features of the work now under way
is that of forest-making. Huge trees, of j
large girth and great spread of limb, are
being transplanted in preat numbers in
the exposition grounds. Trees of mature
growth and great sizo are selected. Exca
vation i* made about the roots so as to
leave them intact in the inclosing earth,
which is so bound and swaddled as to
hold it firmly in place while in transit
on a specially contrived vehicle from the
forests to the place of repiantins;.
The selections were all ninde some time
aso, and as soon as the winter was well
set in large forces of men were bet to work
and the transplanting pushed rapidly so
as to cet the roots well settled in the
ground before the sap begins to run.
By the time of leafing tha formerly
colors. In the center of the nave w? see (
the four massive Norman arches in which
stood the old lantern tower, which gave
light to the choir at a time when glass was I
the luxury and extravagance of kins?.
The Kood screen, carved like an Italian
bridge, separates the nave from the choir.
The great Rood, a figure of Christ on the
cross, used to stand just over the screen,
and here the monks celebrated the mass at
midnight. To this day the lessons are read
from the top of the Rood screen.
It has been said that Christcbtirch is
the only example in England of a min
ster choir remaining absolutely untouched
hi all its quaintness and beauty. The choir- j
stalls are very curious, and the wood
carver of that day must have been allowed
more latitude than his present-day broth
ers. Age lends richness and dignity to
even the most vulgar design, and it is only
after close inspection that we discover the
subject of the splendid carved chairs. A
sailor in a nightcap, having a hand-to
hand battle with a goose, who has stolen
hisdinner; a hungry dog gnawing a bone;
a clown with a swollen face; a monk at
prayers, while a cur makes away with his
dinner; a fox preaching to the geese â and
the animation of these cackling geese
speaks well for the arts of the mendicant
friars to whom the carving has been at
tributed.
The chief jewel in the crown of Christ
church is the reredos, the arrangements of
the high altar, a marvel of archaic carv
ing. What it must have been eight cen
turies ago, with its images of silver and
the gleam of its golden vessels, with the
priests in gorgeous vestments and the
iight of a hundred candies, ail this we can
oniy imagine.
Next to it is the chapel of the ill-fated
Countess of Salisbury. The verger mur
murs how they dragged her from the
chapei, poor old woman, and threatened
her with instant death unless she would
divulge the hiding place of her son, Car
dinal Pole; how they mutilated and de
faced the beautiful chapel and plundered
it of its ornaments; and, finally, they be
headed the poor Countess in the Tower
of London. And this was the Reforma
tion !
Next to the chapel is a little stone
chamber, with no entrance to the church
but an opening large enough for a man
to thrust in his hand. Th<?re was a special
grant for the lepers of the parish, and that
fund is now divided for the benefit of the
deserving poor. It was into this closed
stone cell that they marched, at a certain
hour when the road was cleared for them,
with the sound of their desolating cry
warning their feilow-rnen. The priest
han led in the wafer through that tiny
opening, and before the end of the service
they went forth again through a black
arch with an iron door.
It is a great temptation to linger in the
quaint old church ; perhaps there is hardly
a finer Norman tower than this, with its
boid circular staircase, its splendid arcade,
with its fourteen divisions so wonderfully
wreathed, one within the other and orna
mented with intricate Roman inter
lacini:s, a Iretwork of stone. There is the
lady chapel and the old missal-room, full
of grinning and grotesque gargoyles, and
the crypt, that was discovered in this
century packed solid w;th human bones.
It is with quite the proper little shudder
that we leave this gloomy little subter- I
ranean chamber and pass out into the j
< empty spaces of the Champs Elysees and |
other parts of the grounds will have the
appearance of a forest of fifty years'
growth.
From the Champs Elysees section pas
sage is had to the next, lying on the j
south side of the Seine by the new Pont ;
Alexandre 111, a splendid structure, de
signed by the celebrat3d MM. Cassien-
Bernard, the cornerstone of which was
laid by the Czar during his visit to Paris
last year. The second or Industrial and j
Manufacturing section lies along the Es
pianmie dcs luvalides and comprises four
extensive and splendid palaces.
The plans have recently been amended j
I to make tlie river banks one oi the greatest
attractions of the exposition. Between
the Pont de la Concorde and the Pont de<
j Invalides they will be lined with gayly
decorated terraces and gardens, and on
the south side along the Qual d'Orsay will
stretch hothouses for the horticultural ex
hibits, the pavilions of foreign nations
and the buildings for various special ex
hibits, while from the Pont de l'Alma on
down on both banks will be exhibits of
forest, field and seas.

M^EADOW LARKS sing in the air
S these days, whirring; up from the
_J field furrows with little bursts of
aonji, which they continue as they fly.
This is the very height of their musical
achievements and they reserve it to cele
brate ths recurring spring season. A little
later, when they have wooed and won
their mate and are burdened with family
cares, they will still sing, but more
scdatelv.. from the rocks and the fence
tops. Lateryet, in the autumn days, they
will surprise you by whistling melodiously
from the treetops, for they are biids of
many moods and resources. We owe
them a debt of gratitude, for they stay
with us and sing for us the year round.
They really cannot help sinsine, and as
an earnest of their musical mission they
carry, picked out in black in the brave
yellow of their breasts, a tiny lyre. It is
hard to imagine what our fields would be
without the cheery notes of these birds
singing sweetness into the wheat and bar
ley and oats.
The meadow larks set up housekeeping
early in the season and nest on the
ground, drawing down the tall grasses in
a very clever fashion to conceil their little
Lorries. The small hen is herself quite a
sincerand the pairs may often be heard
cf a summer evening indulging in soft
musical dialogues, now and then inter
rupted on her part by an abrupt chan.e to
a queer, little sculding burden with which
she assails her mate, jometimes keeping
it up for some time.
Just now, however, nothing ssems fur
ther from the ken of the birds than car?.
The air np here on tee hills rings with
their melody and the trees are gay witn
their petty fluttering. It is curious how
prone the birds are to confine themselves
to special localities, jn my immediate
neighborhood, for instance, there are no
meadow larks, but less than a quarter of
a mile above me there are great numbers
of them. To reach them I strike oyer the
hills and pass through an orchard where
hundreds of robins have their headquar

come to this orchard, nor will I meet
many beyond it. Just below me the red
shafted nickers throng. This woodpecker

gp- HE old form of rest cure, with j
its dismal accompaniments of dark, |
pictnreless rooms, its enforced i
isolation from relatives and friends for
a period of six weeta or two months,
its still more trying ordeal of over
feeding, is a thing of the past. It has
been tried and found wanting. Those
who were so unfortunate as to Lave sub
mitted to the rigorous, one might almost
say heroic, treatment that was a part of
it, came forth from it with nerves more
sensitive than ever, mentally unbenetited,
and physically changed only in the pos
session of the extra pounds avoirdupois
the overfeeding had induced. The super
fluous flesh, however, did not mean more
stiength, and it became a matter of re
joicing when, after a few weeks of ordi
nary routine, the patient regained his
usual size. This rigid form of restâ or,
ratner, torture cure, as some who have
taken it facetiously style itâ has been suc
ceeded by a more agreeable as well as
more effective method of restoring tone to
overtaxed nerves.
This is what is known as the Dartial
rest, the leaaing of a comparatively pas
sive existence during possibly three days
of each week for a month, or perhaps two,
the period varying according to the condi
tion of the patient. During these three
days which are passed in bed no treatment
is undergone, except such as relates to the
complete relaxation of mind and body.
Jt may not be uninteresting to picture
the details of this partial rest cure as it is
taken by those whose means and leisure
enable them to reap its full benefit.
The appearance of the patient as she
lies in bed propped up by downy pillows
if> a pleasing one. it is true there are
dark hollows about her eyes that tell of
mental exhaustion and a certain pallor
that betokens luck of strength, but her
cheerful demeanor does not give one tne
impression of an invalid and her cheerful
surroundings do not suggest the sick
ioom. She wears a soft silk dressing
jacket of some becoming color trimmed
with knots of ribbon here and there and
filmy lace at the neck and ialling over the
hands. Her hair is arranged in a loose
knot on the top of her head and confined
with a ribbon corresponding in hue with
that in her jacket. A few flowers are
pinned upon her breast. The appur
tenances of the bed and the room are of
the daintiest. Flowers sent by loving
friends are upon a table near her and also
her favorite books. There is no formida
ble array of medicine bottles upon the
- drcs-er â only one containing a pleasant
tonic.
She eats nothing she does not like, nor
is a handsome bird, but is no less a fellow
than the high-hole, the yellow woodpecker
; of the Eastern States, grown more vivid
in coloring under our favoring Californian
I sides. 1 came upon cna by the roadside
i the other day, lying with outstretched
wings, apparently helpless, on the bank.
I approached quite closely before he
I moved. He flew then witb no especial
effort, but only a short distance, with both
legs banging limply, as if broken. Thir.k
--; ing to catch him I went in pursuit, but he
flew off again and a*ain, each time giving
, a low, troubled cry. In a minute or two
he was answered, and a ddzen or more of
his fellows appeared upon the ncene. Ido
not think I ever before saw so many wo od
peckers together. Round and round their
; wounded companion the 7 flew, calling
'. softly and evidently directing their move
ments with evident reference to me. I
I approached again, and this time the disa
bled flicker let me come quite near, cer
tainly within a couple of yards, before he
rose, surrounded by his comrades, and flew
â  forward. They alighted with him some
! distance away, and as soon as I moved all

every appearance of aesign, and I have no

result that I have recorded.
The delicious spring days of the past
week have brought the small birds out in
great numbers. A flock of greenlets took
; possession of the willows a day or two ago
and have kept the thicket alive with mel
ody ever since their arrival. Indeed, 1
heard them long before I could detect
' their tiny shapes among the young foli
i iage. These are still the days of little
; things, and only the birds that love the
; low, thick-growing trees and bushes have
, as yet come to us. There wili still be days

and so the lovers of tall treetops and high

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
reason the English SDarrow, the one rowdy
of the tribs, is not very numerous Here
abouts this spring, though one or two pairs
have already begun building. We can
spare them, However, but not for a good
deal would I consent to apare the aristo
crat of the whole family, the white
crowned sparrow.
I saw the lirst one of the season yester
day, as I lay in the grass looking up to
where massed white clouds drifted, now
and again, across the blue roof which
seemed to bend down to meet the* green
walls that inclosed me. It was like being I
alone in a small world of my own, ''blue
sky overhead, green sky breaking under,"
and into the midst of it all the white
crowned sparrow flew, perched upon a
low branch just above me and survey ed
Ime \vi:h calm, serene interest. My heart
j gave a leap of welcome. The plain slate-
I colored bird, with his royal little nead, is a
favorite 01 mine. There is a severe ele
gance in the sober earb, a penile, assured
refinement of manner and expressionthat
establish the bird's position at once. He
needs no credentials. You trust him in
stinctively, but when he begins to sing
you at once welcome him in your affection.
One never grows very intimate with the
white-crowned sparrow. He hovers about
and above you, and you may delight in
I I his grace and the beauty of his black-and
i white head, but he is off if you approach
! too near, though not, I am sure, because
i]he is afraid of you. He does not fly away;
. j that phrase is much too abrupt to charac
i | terize the gentle dignity with which he
. ! withdraws from your too near approach.
I 1 If you remain quiet he will presently re
' turn to bis old position and begin to sing,
i j but if you do not take this hint and main
[ | tain a due reserve toward him, he will go off
i I altogether. It is better to humor him,
â¢ ! for he is a delightful companion, only too
â¢ ] glad to have a listener to his sweet, clear,
j but rather plaintive song.
.'â  When I saw the white crown I knew I
I might look for his constant companion,
. i the white-throated sparrow, for these birds
- j are almost always together. I was not
; ; disappointed, for during the afternoon I
r â  encountered quite a flock of the white
â¢ throats among the cypress trees. This
I little bird is not so handsome as its royal
i â¢ friend. It has a tiny white streak along
I j the top 01 its head, and a yellow
) I line before the eye. There is also a dash
s j of yellow in the wings and the throat is
1 marked with a broad white patch. I also
t ' noticed t tie skylark sparrow that same
i j day, and got one or two fleeting glimpses
: j of a plain little bird that 1 took to be a
j Le (Jonte's sparrow, but I could not get
near enough to determine his identity.
As I lay watching the white-crowned
I sparrow my attention was attracted by a
â¢ small object stirring among the thick
i tangle of myrtle that clothes the banks of
i the stream running among the willows
I far below. The distance was too great to
; permit making the obj?ct out, even with
: the aid of a field-glass; so, creeping cau
i tiously down, I crawled in among the
i j myrtle that, unmolested for years, had
, | piled up upon Use!! in rant luxur.ous
. ; ness, so that one could lie among it and
,i be almost hidden. The object of my
: search disappeared a3 I drenv near, but,
â¢ keeping the spot in view, I crept on until
i at last, thrusting an investigating hand
; among the tangled vine?, 1 routed out

usual, Madame, her teacher, requiring Oj
to our mutual discomfiture, a va:ab>nd
hen who, obeying a wild impulse of almost
lost heredity, bad escaped from some
c'n'cken-yard below and stolen a nest in
this wooded tangle.
There iÂ« not much romance about a
h^i's nest. We destroyed that long aeo,
when we took to raising cnickens that we
might eat them; but there is, after all,
something appealing in the thought of
this clam ay, urotesque, often-thwarted
creature, following the deepest instinct of
nature, stealing away to this secluded
spot in the vain hope of eluding her com
mercial destiny. Who can say that that
lowly nest among the myrtle represented
less brooding mother-love, less tender,
anxious, patient yearnin?, les3 fon 1 hoi c
for the future than centered about the
tiny home of the pair of ruby-throated
humming-birds that nested yonder in the
sw etbrier last summer?
Should we despise the white-crowned
sparrow. I wonder, if we could bring it
tamely about our dooryard to look to us
for food and shelter and become spirit
lessly subservient to our ends? Ah, that
little "if" bides the very pith and point of
the matter. The gentle little songster
will not be tamed, even for the seeds and
crumbs. His is a nobler spirit, c, diviner
spark. A lifetime of the cage and the
seedcup would not reconcile him to the
loss of freedom, and this is a large part of
what makes him so dear to us. We love
best, after all, that which we do not con
trol. The physical difference between
the ben and the songbird is by no means
so great or so far-reaching in its effect
upon us as the moral differpnee that sep-

THE MIGHTY MAN OF THE ORPHEUM.
I her very little mental exertion. She
reads â nothing that calls for much
thought, but something light and pleas
ant. Occasionally she takes up some
i fancy work that lies by her. At the first
' indication of fatigue the maid draws the
curtains, shutting out the sunshine which
has been allowed to stream into the room,
I and the patient takes a nap. Her inti
-1 mate friends are not excluded. They drop
' in and chat with her awhile, keeping her
j pleasantly informed of what is passing in
i her circle during her throe days' seclusion.
This one day is an example of theotliers
passed in bed. On the fourth day the lady
rises as usual and attends to the multifari
ous duties that await her. The next week
she takes the three days' rest again, and
I continues it each week during the period
prescribed by her physician.
Of course this luxurious mode of recuper
ating requires more or less constant
attendance. Unless one has a special
maid it incurs a severe tax upon the sec
ond girl, who can scarcely be expected to
attend to her usual duties as well as
assume those of a nurse. To hire an
attendant in a cas- requiring no serious
care seems an unnecessary expense. A
lady in this city who occasionally takes
this partial rest for the restoration
of her nerves has met the emergency in j
a most ingenious way. Her little girl of I
6 years (who is taught at home) is pressed
into service, but in such a manner that it
becomes a pleasure not a hardship to the j
child. It is in fact made a kind of play.
Instead of pretending to be a baby in
mamma's attire and assuming the airs
and conversation of one she plays nurse.
In order to make the child enter the more
earnestly into the "new game" the mother
has made a nurse's costume. A black
alpaca apron is worn over the blue or pink
gingham dress; a tiny white shirt front
covers the waist, with black tie at the
neck, and on the head is piaced a jaunty
mull cap. Nurse Faithful, ?.s the little
one is dubbed, is a quaint figure as she
moves softly about with a dignity and
earnestness suitable to her calling. No
nurse ever felt more fully the responsibil
ity of ncr calling. Sue has entire charge
of mamma, whom she addresses as Mrs.
B. She receives the flowers and ar
ranges them tastefully in glasses or
vases; gives the time; assists in
serving her patient at meals, and
sbakes the pillows as deftly as an older
nurse. She also reads to her invalid,
though ler choice of books 13 limited to
those containing words of one syllable.
Mamma is not the little nurse's only
patient. With swift foresignt she has
brought in her doll's bed and placed it
beside the larger one. Isabella, who has
lost an eye, and Elsie, whose arm is
broken, are placed therein and their
imaginary wants attended to as carefully
as the real ones of her patient. Through
out all she enjoys the play and gives the
patient just the diversion her tired brain
requires. ,
The Bouncer, a Top-Loft
Actor of Heavy Leads
FfT^AYlow! Here comes de bouncer!' 1
iÂ£*- At the words four grimy little
mmJ? hamls shot out simultaneously as if
io recover two dice which lay upon the
floor of a nook in one of the recesses in
the gallery of one of San Francisco's
ponular- priced theaters.
A little crap game between four gamins
of the street had been in progress there,
an. l the warning to "Lay low!" was none
too soon, for the special officer of the
hou-e immediately descendei upon the
crap-shoo'.er-i.
"What are you doing here ? ' demanded
this factotum of the theater.
"Nawthin 1 " piped four snrill voices in
wonderful unison, while four little dirt
begrimed faces, that had been flushed and
excited a few moments before by the
passion of play, were now upturned to
meet the lowering gaze of the bouncer
with an air of injured innocence stamped
upon them.
The quartet was dispersed and the offi
cer sought new fields to conquer.
While the bouncer of such theaters as
Morosco's Grand Opera-hov e and the
Orpheuni are almost, unknown to those
who occupy places in the lower house, he
is really an important functionary in
these places. IVhile he is a man of few
. inches to the people who fill high-priced
] seats, he is a giant, seventeen feet high,
j to the gallery t?ods and is feared and
hated by them accordingly.
The bouncer grows in importance step
by step as he mounts the stairway lead
ing from the parquet of one of these thea
ters to the galleries. There he is Czar.
"Wot de cop says goes!" said a gamin
of the theater-loit to me, and from the
gallery point of view he told his whole
conception of the special officer in a nut
shell.
The bonncer is also an important per
son in his own mind. If he were. not his
tasks would be more difficult, for it takes
a whole lot of self-confidence to be a suc
cessful bouncer. The man's troubles be
gin with the first rush made by an eager
crowd when the gallery doors of one of
these theaters are thrown open, and they
continue until those same doors are closed
upon the back of the last departing *'god"
after the play is over.
When the rusn for the galleries begins
the bouncer's discriminating eye must
separate the lambs from the goats; for
there is such a thing as caste even in the
top lofts of a popular priced theater.
However a eood patron of the bous?
Chimrnie de Tough may be, he cannot
i enter the sacred precincts of the galleries
of such places as are dignified by the
name of "the family circle." "Chimmie"
may put on his best clothes and eat a
whole package of Sen Sen drops in order
to hide the lurking odor of gallons of
bad whisky which he has consumed, and
may tuck his best girl under his arm and
put up a bold "front" to the bouncer, and
vet not be able to enter the Mecca of his
ambition â "de family circle."
For the bouncer is inexorable. He keeps
a little list of those patrons of his theater
calleries who are prone to misbehave
themselves during a performance, and he
trpats them accordingly. The well-regu
lated "ten-center," who is content to sit
still in his seat and express his approval
or disapprobation of a play in "ohs!" and
"ahs! " is allowed to enter "the family
circle." He who is ordinarily inclined to
roughness, but who can be recalled to or
der by a tap or two of the bouncer's stick,
is sent to the "nigger heaven," while there
are others who are not permitted to enter
the theater at all.
Last Sunday night an urchin with great
blue eyes and a face that Despoke ignor
ance of all things bad, save dirt, accosted
Aaron Powers, press agent of Morosco's.
"Say, mister," he said pleadingly, as he
tugged at Powers' coat, "I'm on de dead
square, I am; but de cop has trun me
down an' won't let me go into d' show. I
never did nawthin'. Youse knows I'm
strate, 'cause l'se sold yer papers. It was
anoder kid dat trun de spitball at de bald
head, but de cop tot it was me r.nd tole
de man in de box office to give me de mar
ble heart, an' bo I can't go into d' show.
S'e? I wants youse to square me."
Touched by the appeal, Powers got the
gamin with the pathetic bine eyes past the
, box office, and the urchin was happy on
his way to his heaven in the theater loft,
when the chief bouncer pounced upon
him.
"What are you doing here?" the officer
demanded of the youngster, as he grabbed
him by the collar.
"Please mister, I'm squared?' the
urchin gasped.
"Squared nothing! Come along to the
box office and net your money back !" and,
impelled by the strong arm of the bouncer,
the gamin proceeded to the ticket seller's
window, where the 10 cents he had paid
for admission wai returned to him.
"Sorry, Mr. Powers." the bouncer said
to the press agent, as the latter began to
tell of the cherub's plea, "bat this is about
the toughest kid we ever had in the gal
lery." And "Innocent Biue Eyes" was
ignominiously shovad into tde street.
The bouncer earns his salary. From
the beginning to the end of a performance
he is about the busiest man in the house.
I was talking to Jack^Tillman, the burly
special officer of the Orpheum. the other
night, when he suddenly, with a hurried
"S'cuse me," darted away and made a
dash lor the gallery. He returned in a
few minutes a little breathless, but other
wise unperturbed.
"Whut was the matter?" I asked.
"Oh, I had to throw out a couple of sail
ors who got gay," he said indifferently.
The gallery has a keen apt>reciation of
the ridiculous, and once its risibilities are
aroused even the bouncer finds it difficult
to control it. At times it is like the woman
who had an overweening desire to taugh
at a funeral.
The other night while a most pathetic
scene was being enacted upon the stage of
one of the local theaters, the eallery broke
out suddenly in one loud guffaw. The
bouncer rushed to quell the disturbance.
He found the cnu-e of the undue merri
ment in a quiet man who sat munching
candy in the front row.
The man had been sitting quietly on one
of the rear sea*s, with his hat on, when he
saw a gcd who had been occupying one of
the reserved seats in the front row leave
the house with the air of one who was
leaving it for the night . This man made
a slide for the place and secured it. Hav
ing taken hia seat he removed his hat, in
accordance with the rules of the house
governing those who occupy such exalted
positions. Then the disturbance in the
tallery began. The man's head was ns
bald as a billiard ball, save for a little
fringe of hair that skirted his collar.
A gamin directed the attention of the
gallery to the shining mark, and immedi
ately the gods broke into a wild storm of
laughter and showered innumerable spit
balls at the luckless baid head. Before he
could restore the gallery to order the
bouncer had to induce the man to seek a
less conspicuous place and to resume his
hat.
The gallery god is a stickler for his
"rights." He goes on the hypothesis that I
he "has paid to see the show and he is j
going to see it." He is no respecter of
persons. A woman with a big hat in iront
of him is a black beast to the god, and no
regard for sex impels him to keep his dis
regard for all such to himself. Bouncer
Tillman had to arrest a man the other
night for insisting on the removal of a
woman's hat that offended him.
â 'Now, look a-here," the gallery god said,
as Tillman escorted him down the stairs,
ain't right â see? I asks de loidy
tree timf*^ perlite to take off her tile, an'
pc wuuri't do it â see? An' who tell
wudn't get mad?"
Hugging one's best girl in the gallery is
not considerod good form by the
bouncers. It's a pose that doesn't go.
The other night a young Barbary
Coaster, aressed up "to kill," with nis
THE BOUNCER AT THE GRAND.
"steddy" swinging to his arm, accosted
George Delmas, the head bouncer at
Morosco's. He was one of those wh.o
had been nut on the tabooed list of the
special officer.
"Now, look-a-here, Del," he said, "my
guurl is here wid me, an' I want to go into
de fam'ly circle, see! If you'll let me go
in I'll be on de dead fquare."
Delmas allowed the twain to take seats
in "the family circle," but he had to pull
Ihem from their places during the second
act. They had gone to sleep in each
other's arms and were snoring away to
gether as if to beat the orchestra playing
down below.
But it ia Dot always with such easy
going people that the bouncer has to de a
While there are times when he must be a
diplomat, there are others when he must
be a bruiser, *and thera has been many a
lively go between "d*> cops" of San Fran
cisco theater lofts and obstreperous
patrons of the houses that have
never been recordpd among notable
fistic encounters. For your truc-biuo
bouncer has the "scrapping blood" royal
in his veins, and when things aru rveu
had rather use his tisi'3 tiian bis club.
But the bouncer has his club with lum all
the time, and the gallery gods know it,
and they respsct the club, if not the man.
They know the officer has the law and the
numbers on his side, and it is only when
they get drunK that the top-lofters ques
tion the authority of this monarch of the
theater galleries, and when they do this
they invariably land in the City Prison.
For "de bouncer rules de roost 1"
y\r\ Elk park.
"I own an elk farm. As far as I know
there is not another such farm in the
world,' 1 says a writer In Topeka Capital.
"There may possibly men wbo hold elk in
captivity and who keep them for breeding
purposes to a certain extent; but to have
a regular farm, where there is nothing but
elk, where they are looked after, kept in
condition and treated just the same as any
cattle â that is a thing which I do not be
lieve any one has done before me.
"My farm is one of the most picturesque
parts of Colorado, in a valley sixteen
miles east of MeeKer. It is 1(33 acres in
extent, and through the length of it runs
a splendid trout stream, well known
throughout the surrounding States under
the name of the Big Beaver. My farm ia
in the very heart of the White River coun
try, a tract which i 3 not excelled in the
United States for the variety of its big
game. Indeed, it is often called the Para
dise of the Sportsman.
"Some idea oi the extent to which I work
my farm may be gained from the 'act that
each year 1 raise from my elk alone
enough bay to bale up LOG tons, and
garner from 300 to 500 bushels of grain.
On this farm, which ia HoOO feet above the
level of the sea, the elk roam through the
timber land and across the roliing mead
ows just as though they were not capiive.
But they are safe enough, nevertheless,
for I have them fenced in with a live
strand barb-wire fence.
"In my time I have lollowed many lines
of work and farmed in different part 3of
the country, but I have never found any
such experience as I am now passing
through. The elk is such a strange ani
mal; but in time they get to be just as
gentle as milch cows.
"It has been four years since I first took
the notion ot taming the elk and rasing
them, just as other people raise cattle. It.
took me a year to get me farm in order,
to capture the six animals with which I
started and to place them in the inclined
ranch. Up to that time I did not know
whether thÂ« idea was feasible; I was airaid
that I should have a great deal of trouble
in domesticating them.
"In their native tracts the elk of all s zes
ann apes seem to be perfectly able to take
card of themselves and their horns.
But when once they get on a faim
they seem to forget all this. The
young steer?, especially, get into no
end of trouble and break their horns
in the most distressine manner. As
these broken horns and badly spreading
prongs injure the general appearance of
the herd, I have contrived a means of reg
uiating and controlling the horn's growth.
This is done by means of a box-like
wooden frame, light and easily carried by
the elk. The horns are guided in their
growth by this frame, and it also keeps
the animal from getting into bad places in
the timber belt. Then, too, when tho
horns Â»re still in the miik they are very
soft and easily damaged. They have t">
be watched with the greatest caution, and
iron rust must l>e mixed with their food,
as it has a strengthening quality."
The most valuable fur is that of the sea
otter. One thousand dollars has been
paid for a single skin of this animal not
more than two yards long by three-quar
ters of a yard wide.
The most unhealthy city in Europe is
Barcelona, Spain. The number of deaths

EVENTS OF THE WEEK SOCIETY
Pf^HE advent of the Lenten season means I
tj3o rest and quiet in social circles. Until
o'iV* the penitential season is past, there
will be no big entertainments.
Little luncheons, informal dinners, card par
ties and small teas always flourish during
Lent, and at mi-careme there is sure to be one
or more elaborate social functions. Prepara
tions for Easter will take up much of the lei
sure of the smart set, and it is expected that
. beveral of the generous hostesses who have
â  cot entertained during the winter will redeem
themselves by brilliant Easter entertain
merits.
â¢ Naturally all the entertainments of the past
week were insignificant and puny compared
With the magnificence of the Mardi Gras Dall. i
Contrary to custom, entertainment of the
Art Institute more than realized the expecta
tions of those fortunate enough to attend.
On Monday afternoon ihe Misses Sidney
Smith entertained a few young girls at an in
lormal tea at tneir home on Broadway.
On Monday evening Mr. and Mrs. Schwerin
gave an elaborate dinner party at which

'_'i>. The occasion was an "at home" reception
given by Mrs. E. C. Voorheis, Mrs. A. W. Bar
rett, Mrs. 'William Beckman, Mrs. F. S. Strat
ton and Mrs. Thomas Flint.
A large throng of the best-known society
peoDle residing in the Capital City attended,
together with many prominent representatives
Irom other cities of the Slate.
A feature of the reception that attracted
m cciai attention was the superb decoration of
the parlors. Delightful music was discoursed
throughout the evening and refreshments
were served.
The assembly and german of the Entre Nous
Cotillon Club held on Thursday evening in
the Maple Hall of the Palace Hotel was the
last meeting this popular club will hold until

Nnshville, Term.. by tLe opening of the mid
â¢wi liter meetings of the American Whist
Lengile.
The Nashville American of February 23
Buys: Tne members of the Nashville whist
clubs are having a real good time just now.
Nothing so delights the heart of the genuine
whist er.thusia.-.t as to be able to interchange
vkwsofthe great game of science with and ]
play it with those who have become cele
brated as exponents of the game. This oppor
tunity is now afforded the members of the
local clubs to a rare degree, for they have as
their honored guests the executive committee
of the American Whist League.
The business meeting of the committee was
opened at the Duncan Hotel at 10 o'clock, j
Vice-President H. A. Mandellof Detroit presid
ing. On account cf sickness in the president's j
luinily he was unable to attend.
The session was occupied in discussing and
formulating plans for the next congress, which
meets on July 6 at Put-in Bay, on Lake Erie.
The report ot the tournament committee on
t!;e schedule of games for the congress was re
ceived and adopted.
The two principal contests that will take
place at this meeting will be that for the Ham
ilton Club trophy, for ternus of four, and the
one for the American Whist League trophy,
ulso for teams of four. There will also be a
contest for pairs, playing for the Minneapolis
trophy.
' Heretofore the American Whist League
trophy contests commenced the middle of the
week. It will now commence the same time
as the Hamilton trophy. The preliminary
games will take place each evening instead of

President Kellogg of the State University, ;
wo hundred and more members, nearly every ,
one of whom has a system of play of his own. ;
o wonder President Weems took a trip into !
the wild rind woolly West to get away fiom
making explanation* of why such a sad state
of affairs exists. The only way we can account
for it is, one of the members of this club is one |
of the committee of experts appointed by the
president of the American Whist League to re
port at the next congress, to be held at Put- j
in-Bay in July next, a system of play which in I
their judgment is the best. This gentleman
is undoubtedly having the entire membership
of the club try all known and unknown sys- I
terns to aid him if possible in making a thor
ough report. We have olten thought it strange
that a club containing so many individual ex
pert players made such a Door showing when
they come to play match games. But the de- |
moralized condition ol whist in the club is the j
probable explanation.

WHIST
Trick Gâ North's lead of jick tf spades shows i
that he has queen and two more at least re
maining of ihe suit.
Trick 7â lt is now quite clear that North has
the king of diamonds (see remark at trick 1).
Trick 11â North is marked with the best
diamond and the best spade. If South lea Is
the king of club> and then a small club North
will be put to a card (guessing), and, unless he
has followed the discards very carefully, may
throw the wrong card; and thus East aud
West would save the game. Honors counted

SHORT SUITS VERSUS LONG SUITS.
Mrr. Margaretta Wetherall Wallfice, whist
editor of the Evening Post of New York, com
ments on the short-suiters as follow*:
"The Eastern series of matches for the chal
lenge troDhy ended last Saturday with an
other defeat for the celebrated short-suit team
of the Wh;st Club of New York, the victory
going to the Albany Whist Club by a final
score of 24â1!). The contestants were: al
bnnv (holders)â E. Le Roy Smith (enptain),
C. F. Snow, 0. Batchelder and D. Muhlielder;
the Whist Club of New York (challengers)â
C. R.Kelley (captain, and couch), C. A. Hen
riques, W. E. Hawkins and E. A. Buflington.
The holders played their usual conserva
tive long-suit game, and the challengers
upon this occasion varied their customary
snort-suit absurdities by playing tne equally
dangerouÃ nou-informatory guess game that
has recently been advocated by whist writers
who by forge of circumstances have been
obliged to give up exploiting short-suitism.
The changes made in the New York's system
do not appear, however, to have helped the
score, the result of the match being the usunl
Waterloo that overtakes all teams that are
foolhardy enough to play any inventions of
their own against the established system
which is used by all the star tournament teams
of the country. It must not be forgotten that
while New York sont its crack four into the
contest, Albany was deprived of the expert
services of Barrlngtoa Lod?e Jr.. a valuable
veteran in match play whose position on the
team could not be adequately filled.
What Is Jormey's High-LoW piay?
This question we have been asked a number
I of times since the puolicatton of our "Whist
[ Don'ts." The "high-low play" is merely a
! name given to the playing of an unueces-
I sarily high card, afterward a lower one, at any
stage of the game for the purpose of informa
tion. It can b? used in calling for trumps,
echoing or sub-echoing the call, to change the
suit, to reverse the meaning of your discard,
to show strength or command in Â»uit, or to
show weakness. Some time ago we asked, and
off -.-red a premium, lor a name for this play,
and dancing. At 11 :30 the guests sat down to
a bountiful supper.
Among those present were: Miss Lulu Bur
meist?r, Herman Vmidcwater, Miss Dollie
Walsh, Frank Kerrigan, Miss Marsarct Pride.
Edward Michel, Miss Margaret Michel, Edward
Felvey, Miss Loretta Holland, George Merrill,
Miss May Merrill, Neal Kenetick. Miss Josie

and Miss M. Hughes In the grand march.
This is the last party that the club will give
until May 11. owing" to the Lenton season. Tne
floor was under the dirpction of the following:
Floor manager, K. Matheson; assistant, M. L.
and Mrs. L. \V. Sitton, president of the Kate
Wlieelock Clnb of Portland, Oregon, came to
our rescue. We think the term or name high
low is a good on", and when we use it our read
ers will know what it means.
Healdsburg Whist Glub.
The selection of Arthur L. Harris of Santa
Rosa as one of the directors of the Pacific Coast
Whist Association was a good choice. Every
we ( ek we hear something good of him in a
whist way. The boys of Healdsburg no doubt
caught the fever of Him, aud ihe result is the
formation of a now whist club with the follow
ing members: Dr. C. W. Weaver, J. R. Miller,
F. Cunningham, John Meiler, A. W. Garrett, J.
F. Ciiff man and William N. Copeland.
What Is the Jhree-Trump Echo ?
We have of late been asked to explain the
thr.'e-trump echo. E. T. Bikjr, whist editor
of the Brooklyn Engle and one of the whist
experts of the Ciuntry. answers the same
question so wl-II that we quote It:
The three-trnmp echo was introduced about
a year ago and was lit first used only whan a
partner led a high trump, lndiOKiiiig great
strength, such as ace, queen or jack, but not
with king. It consisted then in pi lyi-'S the
second Dest trump, whether holding three or
four, and afterward playing the next lower on
a partner's lead of such high card, on the
theory that if a partner had such a long trump
suit nothing was lost by playing second
best, even if a high trump. It was after ward
changed so that it was used on any high card
led, und more recently on any trump led 1 by a
partner. In this case, however, It was fjund
that loss frequently ensued If the second Best
trump was played, and it turned out
that partner was not leading from trump
strength, so that the device has been still
further modified uutil it is generally used as
iollows:
When you are playing to your partner's
lead of trumps and nro not trying to win the
trick, play the intermediate of exactly threa
trumps; bnt with more or lesi ihnn, three
play your lowest trump. At the first oppor
tunity you should make the echo in a plain
suit to inform your partner that you held
originally more then two trumps; the fail
ure to echo will show that you did not nave
as many as three. Suppose, for example,
that your partner leads jack of trumps. You,
holding ten, seven and four, play tue seven.
On the uext round, or in case you should
ruff, p]ay the four and your partner will un
derstand that you have one higher than the
seven. Suppose a piain suit is led by your
adversaries and you play the three and then
the two of the plain suit. Your partner
will know that you hold more than two
trumps. If you next piay the four of trumps
j he will kuow that it is three exactly, but if
j your next trump, after having echoed, is

Games and dancing were indulged in until
early morn.
At midnight the guests repaired to the din
ing-room, where a sumptuous repast was
served, atwhioh many toasts were offered.
higher than the first one played, your partner
will know you held as many as four. The ad
vantage of this is that if it turn* out that
your partner led the jack or any other trump
from weakness, you have not given away your
holdinc as soon as your, adversaries by hold
ing your lowest trump if you held. four. This
style of echoing in trumps is decidedly the
most satisfactory. and advantageous of any
ever devised, as it gives earlier Information of
your holding to your partner when ho wants
it and enables you to withhold it frequently
when it would be disadvantageous. It is only
used, however, when you are following suit to
your partner's lead in trumps and are not try
ing to win the trick. In all other cases the old
plan of echoes and sub-chocs are still used.
The following scene was witnessed during
the; New Jersey match at one of the tables
where a Brooklyn pair was seated East and
West. South opened with six ot diamonds,
West played knave, North won with the ace
and returned small diamond. East, having
king, queen and another left, won with the
queen, and-his partner played the tray. East
immediately -led trumps up to a five-card
trump suit in North's hand with most disas
trous results, and when the deal was finished
and it was iound that they had lost just four
tricks. East mildly (?) remarked to West:
"Partner, not that I wish to find fault, but
why in thuuder did you call for trumps?"
"I did not call," replied West. "Yes, you
did," said East: "you played the jack and
then the three, and, of course, . I had 10 lead
trumps. " "Oh," said West, "I was only cov
ering second hand, because I held an imper
fect fourchette," .Curtain.

& MINERS
?|p5^HE new State Mineralogist, A. a Cooper,
Vl"~Y " M Â° me idea 3 about the State Mining
34?* Bureau and its operation by which he !
may thus early be differentiated from other"
State Mineralogists we have had. There has
been considerable curiosity manifested regard
ing Mr. Cooper and the official career which
he is about to begin, and what he announces
concerning his policy will bo read with in
terest.
The term of Mr. Crawford expired February
23, but Mr. Cooper, on account of private af- i
fairs, will not assume his duties until April 1, j
allowing the present regime to be maintained
another monta. The new official will mean
time have on his hands the pleasant task of
deciding on the distribution of the patronage
of the office, for which there is the usual
scramble-
Mr. Cooper is yet willing to speak only in a
very general we- about what he will do.
That, of course, depends mainly on the appro
priation allowed by the Legislature. li the
amount allowed for the support of the bureau
should be but the $12,200 a year allowed by i
the Assembly committee the mineralogist
could be little more than the keeper of a mu
seum, but Mr. Cooper is confident that the
Â£50,000 now named by the Assembly for the
two years will be allowed, and that he will be
able to carry out the work he contemplates.
The gold miners, whose interest is mainly
in the gold fields, nave been slightly suspi
cious of the new official because he has not j
been known as a gold miner, as his predeces
sors have been, and have wondered, if he
would not wander too far from the mother lode
and- forget the shining metal in the asphaltum
fields and other deposits of baser treasures.
A brief conversation with Mr. Cooper yester
day indicates that he appreciates fully the
chief importance of gold mining, and will en
deavor to make the Institution of the best
practical service to the industry, and that he
is inclined to exalt petroleum, water and
other resources somewhat higher than other
State mineralogists have done.
Mr. Cooper followed his father into the gold
fields of the State in 1853, and was a gold
miner for some years. For a good many years
now he has lived at Santa Barbara, and as a
civil and mining engineer and otherwise has
been concerned chiefly with the asphaltum,
petroleum and water resources of that region.
How he will apportion the energies of the
Mining Bureau remains to be seen, but it is
promised that the minor minerals of the State
will receive increased attention.
"The economic geology of California" is to
be the keynote of the new administration,
and its worK is to be "practical." Mr. Cooper
is especially interested in two things. One is
the development of a great subterranean
water supply tor regions of Southern Califor
nia, for which it can be developed by boring
tunnels Into the Coast Range of mountains
and tapping the water reservoirs formed by
impervious strata.
"Water is the great thing," said Mr. Cooper.
"It will transform a desert into a paradise.
It is our most precious mineral product, espe
cially south of TehachapL The possibilities of
supplementing the surface supply with a sup
ply from underground are great and but little
studied. At Santa Barbara the tunnel which
has been bored into the mountain range for
1000 feet now yields .100,000 gallons daily,
and the Ripply increases with each foot
idvanced. At Pomona a tunnel yields 200 |
aches per day, or ten times as much as at
Santa Barbara.
â¢ "The Santa Yuez range will undoubtedly
yield water enough to irrigate the entire nar
row stretch of land along the coast for 120
miles from Point Conception to the San Buena
ventura River. This is the best lemon-produc
ing region in California, but it lacks the
needed water. In this range the water is ob
tainable ia this way because of the geologic
structure. The strata when they were up
lifted and folded on each other formed by iheir
grinding action veins of clay, which are im
pervious to the water, while the sandstone
formations between them act as a sponge to
bold the water. The mountain ranges of the
State, especially of Southern California, are
worthy of long and careful study, with
teference to the possibilities of their thus
yielding permanent water supplies. Hardly
my study in this direction has been made,
md it is worthy of the attention of the State
Mineralogist. I shall give my personal atten
tion largely to this and to the oil fields.
"California is third among the States as an
ail producer and it might be first. We have
an oil belt extending from Humboldt County
to Orange County, yet if the Market-street
Railroad Company used oil for fuel it would
use the eutire product of the State itself,
rhere are oil indications along the entire
Coast Range and yet thera has ceen virtually
ao prospecting for oil done. The discoveries
if the Snmmerland and Los Angeles fields as
well as others have been* made white boring
for something else. This suggests the great
fusibilities of the range when capital takes
bold. It will cost a good deal of money to
study the formations. I would continue the
rood work in Southern California which has
jeen done by Mr. Watts, possibly with some
modification*, and would extend the study
ilong the entire coast to the extent that the
possibilities permit.
"The most valuable work of the bureau Is its
Reid work, and this should embrace the eco
aomic geology of the State and be wholly
practical. The undeveloped and slightly de- |
reloped mineral resources of the State are
jreat and varied. The building stones, es
pecially the limestones, of the State deserve
jspecial study. As one of many things take
hÂ«* matter of hydraulic cemants. We import
â¢ast quantities from England, Germany and
Belgium and manufacture very little, yet the
materials of required excellence undoubtedly
?xist in the State and will be revealed with
the stu3y of its economic, geology."
"Gold-mining is, of course, the chief thing,"
said Mr. Cooper, when that was mentioned.
"I think that it would be a good thing for the
Mining Bureau to study what processes are
best adapted to ores sent in rather than to
simply make free assays and show the amount
of the precious metals In them. Especial at
tention should be given to mining processes,
for scientific processes are becoming more im
portant every year, Â«nd research should aid in
adapting these processes to California ores.
Everything done should be practical and
economic. I have not settled on any particu
lar lines to be followed, but I shall not try to
find out whether the Coast Range or the
Sierra' Nevada Range is the oldest, for instance.
No; the mother lode has been studied until
the mother is tired. The daughters ought to
have a chance. For one thing I don'ttninkl
shall advertise Individual mines in a direc
tory."'
This observation relates to the descriptive
roster of the mines in the State contained in
the lait and in two or three old reports of the
State Mineralogist. ,
"I don't think it important to tell that this
thc.il is down so many feet and that the horse
pojver of that engine is so much. I would
give less attention to what man has done aud
more to what God has done.
"Well, as to particular subjects of Inquiry
there are many. For instance, there are tne
zold-bearlng beach sands along the southern
coast that deserve study. These sands are
thrown up mainly by certain kinds of storms, '
\nd so can be worked but irregularly, and '
hey are crudely worked. Improved methods j
md processes might bo found adapted to
hem."
Mr. Cooper's offhand remarks thus given
ndieate that the new State Mineralogist has
)r:ginal idea's to start with and that Some in
.cresting and important work may be done by
he Minine Bureau during the next two years.
The miners seem to be coming out of -their
wrestle with the Legislature as fortunately as
they expected aud by getting practically all
they asked for. At this writing the debris and
the dredger appropriations are in the hands of
the Governor, with the certainty that trie
debris bill will be signed and a probability
that the dredger will al*o be.
As soon as the debris bill Is signed the $250,
--000 tnat has lain in the treasury for four years
will be available, and Debris Commissioner
John F. Kidder may at once arrange with the
Federal Debris Commission for its expendi
ture, according to their plans, in paying the
Stale's half of the cost of impounding dams.
The allied measure appropriating $300,000
for dredging the lower Sacramento is iudl
recty of importance to the miners, largely in
the further casing of the way to the resump
tion of hydraulic mining and the lessening of
opposition that will result. Strong influence
will be brought to bear to maintain at $50,000
the appropriation for the support ot the
State Mining Bureau for two years and the
effort promises to be successful. To cut down
the amount would be to paralyze this impor
tant institution which may do so much to aid
development of the mineral resources of the
State.
SAMPLING.

working test is to be made should be taken

DIFFERENT ORES.
cal miner in a quantity not less than thirteen
cubic feet and should be of as true an average
of the ore in sight as can possibly be obtained.
The broken thirteen cubic feet should then
be conveyed to the place selected for making
the test and with spaliing-hammers broken to
the size of macadam stuff, of which, alter a
thorough mixing, 200 weight representing as
nearly as possible an average of the whole
should be taken and placed on a piece of can
vas about two yards square, in the center of
which is a stamp-die, and then with cobbing
hammers the 200 weight should be reduced
small enough to pass through a two-inch rid
dle. The die is then removed and the canvas
raised from each side so that the broken
quartz will be well mixed, from which two
samples of four pounds each can then be
taken.
The cobbed four â¢ pound camples should
then be passed through Taylor's hand rock
cruther till it is fine enough to go through a
seive with thirty holes to the linear inch, or
finer if considered advisable.
Ta ylor's hand-crusher has many advantages
over the common mortar and pestleâ first, in
the rapidity with wnich it will crusn the ore
to the desired fineness without the stamping
and grinding action of the mortar and pestle,
by which action so large a proportion of the
gold is laminated and floats away when at
tempts are made to obtain the gold by me
chanical assay-washing.
Those conversant with mining and milling
know that there are three modes of reducing
gold ores, copper, Rilver, lead and other oresâ
namely, "crushing," "stamping" and "grind
ing." The first is effected by horizontol roll
ersâ rock-breakers; the second by stamps; the
third by edge-mills, pans, arrastras and mill
stones.
The great objection to the two latter modes
of reduction in the treatment of gold ores are
the lamination of the gold, and the produc
tion, when silver, copper, load and other ores
are so reduced, of so large a quantity of slimes.
Tha various simple appliances employed for
panning out gold and the separation of it
from pyritic matter and earthy materials are
as follows: First, "flit shovel," the use of
which is by Cornish ore-dressers termed "van
ning." The foreman of the different dressing
floors where cooper, lead and tin ores areas
sorted and concentrated for market neces
sarily "van" with considerable skill. Vanning
is occasionally brought into use in testing for
gold.
Secondâ The "pan" as used by placer miners
and prospector*. It is made out of one piece
of sheetiron, and for washing gravel and
cleaning up in milling it is superior to any
other utensil. A small riddle (picking riddle)
similar to those used in assorting lead and
other ores, would greatly assist the operation
of washing small quantities of gravel. The
earthy matter would be more easily removed
or cleansed than by rubbing the gravel be
tween the hands. The picking riddle, with
about eight hole* to the linear inch, has two
long handles fixed to It to work it.
A large tub, partly filled with water, is re
quired. The riddle, with the gravel in it to be
washed, is then immersed in the water, and
by a sharp, quiet, half-rotary motion the cloy
or soil is soon removed from the pebbles or
gravel. What will not paÂ«s through tho rid
die is then emptied on a table or board, so
that it can be examined to see if there are
any nuseets or cement that require crush-
Ing. In estimating the value of "drifting
gravel" it is best to do so by the cubic foot,
and in the i.bsence of sluices to use the
picking riddle and then to wash cut the gold
with a pan. "In place" the average Small
gravel will weigh eighteen cubic feet to the
ton; on the dump twenty-oeven cubic feet.
Thirdâ The "horn spoon" used principally,
I believe, by the Mexican minors and millmen
I to teat the mercury in the different stages of j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 7, 1897.
the "patio" and other amalgamation pro- I
cesses. Many of our California experts use it
in prospecting for gold. It is of various shapes I
and sizes, but all of them too small to treat a I
quantity of pulp sufficient for a washing test
for gold, besides which the grease from the
finger ends in stirring up the pulp in the
spcon causes a large proportion of the
scale gold to float away on the water, particu
larly that form of gold generally met with in
the cellular portions of the quartz and mostly
associated with ferruginous matters. To prove
how easily the gold attaches itself to the
grease, take some seabeach gold, put it into the
horn spoon and rub it with the ends of your
fingers, then add water to it, and you
will find the greater part of it will float away.
Nevertheless, with the horn spoon the pres
erve of gold may be detected, but I cannot
recommend it for a mechanical or washiug
assay, the results not being reliable, in fact,
mere guess work.
Fourthâ The '-Batea," a wooden bowl or yes
! sel used for washing gold by the Mexican and
j Brazilian miners, and though these two im
i plements differ very much in size and shape,
1 in skillful hands very good results are ob
; tamed from both. My improved form of Bra
! zilian batea is the result of many years of
; study. The pattern of my latest improved form
| I have given to John Taylor i Co., and to
| Justinian Caire of this City, who are mak
i ing them in good form and of suit
j able wood. The improved batea if skill
fully handled will give very accurate results,
showing nearly every particle of mechanically
| combinea gold in the lodestone. It is very
! useful aÂ» a concentrator to find the percentage
!ol pyri'.ic matter in the ore. When the miner
I is desirous of making a very accurate working
j test two bateas should be used, so that the
tailing irom the first operation can be worked
over again. Tne rirht hand fingers should
i also Â«je covered with rubber cots, so that
i the please from them may not float the
gold. A little washing ammonia should also
be added from time to time during the wash
ing or panning out. In case there is any
taicose or greasy matter in the samples, it
snould be soaked in boiling water with a little
caustic soda for ten or fifteen minutes before
panning.
When the gold and pyritic matter are
brought together in the center of the batea
and well freed from the gangue, allow them
to be covered with one or two inches of water,
: and then with a bar magnet remove all mag
| netic iron, which can be easily effected, but
j care must be taken at the same time, that
none of the gold it picked up with the Iron ;
by striking tne magnet slightly against the
side of the washing tub the iron will fail from
the magnet.
When all the gold is well collected In the
center of the batea a little pure mercury Is
added, sufficient to form a hard amalgam.
This mercury being rubbed by the finger cov
ered by a cot^wi 11 rapidly take up the gold,
the wooden surface of the batea greatly as
sisting the operation.
The pyritic matter left, if thought to con
tain any gold, can be ground up fine with
watar and mercury In an agate mortar or
roasted in a clay dish with a little nitrate of
soda and then amalgamated.
The four-pound samples are then to be
treated as directed in using the batea and the
j resulting amalgam put in a piece of charcoal
I and the mercury volatilized by the aid of a
blowpipe; the resulting gold being weighed,
the value per ton of rock will be found by
the accompanying tables. In case the fineness
of the gold appears to d.ffer from that of the
district it can easily be determined with suffi
cient accuracy by the touchstone of testing
needles.
It will be necessary for the miner or pros
pector to have a portuble, accurate and cheap
balance, which can be had of Messrs. John
Taylor & Co., First street, San Francisco*
Prospector' 3 and miner's cold table to deter
mine free gold per ton of 2000 pounds average.

Many years ago I had occasion to make a
cursory examination of what at one time was
considered a very important mining district.
"Meadow Lake," a large town was built, then
called "Summit City," which "city" might be
said to have been built up by hign assay;, and
let down by working results.
It is impossibe to say how many indes
cribable processes were tried there to save the
gold, from numerous high assays they were
led to believe the lode matter contained.
The samples which gave high as-ays were
supposed to have been taken by parties who
thoroughly understood the business. The as
say certificates ot Meadow Lake rock, if bound
up together, would make quite a large volume.
Vast sums of money must nave been expanded,
how much it is impoÂ«siblc to tell; but I feel
assured that had the simple, practical test
which I have now tried to describe been
applied at the mines by some experienced
hand, the greater part of the money would
have been saved, and from the cursory exam
ination I made of the district I feel satisfied
many of the large mines would now be in suc
cessful operation.
I hope the day has gone by when breaking
small pieces of rock from here and there in
the lode for fire assay, or worse â¢â¢till, pound
ing in a mortar and afterward attempting to
wush out the gold with greasy fingers in a
horn spoon and then by the aid of a powerful
magnifier guessing the gold contents of the
rock, will be considered a reliable assay.
It might save a great deal of trouble in case
the prospector feels satisfied that the lode
matter is worth it to have the four-pound
samples careiully washed and then send the
concentrates to be smelted. Professor Price's
charge for such work is about $3.
MINING MISCELLANY.
American Flat seems likely to be drained at
last, and if so, a partial revival of the pros
perity cf the Comstock region will follow.
American Flat is an eleva ed basin close to
the Comstock group of mines, and contains
extensive veins of good ore which were partly
developed years ago. Water appeared so
abundantly at comparatively slight depth thai
work was abandoned on all the properties,
which have been idle ever since. Pumps were
inadequate to overcome the flow, and the de
velopment of the lodes was seen to be impos
sible without deep-tunnel drainaee. Such a
tunnel has long been a Comstock dream.
The cheapest plan is to connect with the
Sutro Tunnel by a tunnel from one of the Com
stock mine?, and to bore such a tunnel 7&00
feet in length from the Alta mine, a company
has been formed at Virginia City with a capi
tal stock of $10,000,000. The directors are to
be: H. M. Yerrington, W. E. Sharon, J. W.
Eckley, H. M. Gorham, E. D. Boyle, Albert
Lackey and J. R. Ryan.
The Thistle Shaft mine In Plumes County is
to be pumped out at large expense and a mile
drainage tunnel is talked of.
A great amount of mining machinery and
supplies is stored at various mouutain points
waiting for the roads to become passable.
The Taylor diggings hydraulic mine of
Plumas County is to Ije put into operation with
twenty-five men us soon as the water season
opens.
A ledge of gold ore fifty feet wide has been
located in Muletowu Mountain, Shasta County,
and hp.s been traced for over a mile.
The Kappahanuock mine, Tuolumne County,
is to have a fifteen-stamp mill.
The Accident mine at Big Oak Flat, Tuo
lumne County, has been bonded for $8000.
A French company, which has Dought the
idle Punchbowl gravel mine in Tabe Mount
ain, Tuolumne County, will soon begin opera
tions.
Copper has been added to the discoveries of
the Randsbuxg district.
A marble quarry has been located in San
Bernardino County, twelve miles from Victor.
The Pittsburg mine, in Nevada County, will
soon resume operations on an extensive scale.
C. J. Bandman has sold his interest to Mr.
Epstein, one of tne original owners, who will
pay all claims and employ a large force of
men.
The Hidden Treasure mine, In Placer
County, will soon have a 75- horsepower elec
tric-power plant, and trie scale of operations
generally will be increased.
At the Red Point gravel mine, in Placer
County, the main tunnel Is in 10,000 feet, and
sixty men are employed.
Directions for sampling auriferous lode mat

Garlock in the Randsburg district, has tele
graphic communication, mail twice a day
and- eleven stages each way daily. It is again
reported that Southern Pacific surveyors are
In the field pioneering for a branch road into
the district. The town has about 300 people,
four stamp mills and one cyanide plant.
The Ford mine is almost the first effort at
deep mining around San Andreas, Calaveras
County. The mine was operated for some time
by the Ford brothers, but later corporation
was effected, a number of the leading citizens
of San Andreas and their friends taking a
portion of the stock, and they have kept a
force of men employed under the Ford broth
ers. The snait is now down 400 feet. The
company intends to continue the shaft on to
the 1000-foot mark. A mill test of 1000 tons
is to be made as soon as a mill can be secured
for the purpose in the neighborhood.
At ;he Kennedy they arc sinking the south
shaft from the 1950 level, and will probably
co down to the 2200 level before stopping.
The are working the levels from the 2100 .evel
in the north shaft, taking out ore enough to
keep the 40-statup mill running niiht and
day.
The Bonanza on Grizzly Gulch, Siskiyou
County, will be opened up this spring, some
very rich, ore having been discovered last
winter.
The men who have a bond on the Allen
mine in Quartz Valley, Biskiyou County, are
meeting with succeSs. On the 350 level they
drifted north and tound a good 4-foot ledge
thtt prospects well. Compressed air is used
for drilling' and also tor running tne hoist.
The quartz is crushed in a 10-stamp mill.
The Opera mine in tho B.ick Hawk mining
district, San Bernardino County, has been
so!d by O. G. Leach to R. F. Harrison and
Llewellyn brothers of Los Angeles.
The Minnesota mine, Shasta County, will be
started up again. There isa 10-stnmp mill ou
the property and at a depth of 400 feet the
ledse is from three to six feet wide.
The Gladstone property, Shasta County, is
to be explored with a diamond drill.
The Le Roi mine, British Columbia, has
shipped 100 tous of ore daily on an average
this year.
The Kootenay country, British Columbia,
has produced this yÂ»Â«r. up to February 20,
$1,296,800, of which $632,900 is the value of
the product ot smelters snipped and $663, 894
is the value of ore exported.

INCIDENT OP THE REVOLUTION.
j The r:im Mi* Chain Stretched Across
the Huditon to .Defend the River.
There are not many peoplo who would
j recognize in the name Samuel Wheeler a
i person who did valuab.e service for onr
i country in the war of the Revolution. It
was he who made the famous chain that
was stretc ea across the Hudson River to
stop the British warships from ascending
the stream. At the time General Wash
ington was puzzled about defending the
river.
"I wish I conld get a chain made, but
that is impossible," he said, and General
Mitiiin, who overheard tne remark, ex
claimed :
"'Not so. We hayÂ« a man in the army, a
townsman of mine, one Wheeler, who can
make you such a cnain."
General Washington bad Wheeler
broueht to him and said:
, "I want a chain to put across the North
River to stop the British ships. Can you
j make it?"
"I can," replied Wheeler, "but I cannot
[do it here."
"Then," said Washington. "I will cheer
fully give you dismission from the army to
do "so, for badly as we want such men as
you I cannot afford to keep you."
Mr. Wheeler made the chain, and its
links were hauled across New Jersey, to
be finally strung across the river, where it
did good service. By building a fire under
one of the links and then using a sledge
hammer and a chisel, it was ultimately
cut apart. â Harper's Round Table.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
SUNDAY MARCH 7, 1897
During the week ending yes-
terday THE CALL published
46 1 S inches
of advertisements, which is
Q Q4: inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
Now, tnen, for harmony.
Let us make it an era of good feeling.
The way to have prosperity is to work
for it.
There should be no factious opposition
to the tariff.
Let us start the boulevard as a highway
to better times.
Don't fail to subscribe to the fund to
provide work for the unemployed.
When all classes of citizens work
together great things are accomplished.
The cloudy skies give the outlook for
agriculture all the brightness of sunshine.
The great powers have found th<?y can
not take Greece out of Crete with soft
soap.
If we get the new tariff bill by the Ist of
July we will make the Fourth glorious,
indeed.
The Greek backbone is strong enoueh to
make a bold front and may be Btrong
enough to win out.
A war in the Levant would send wheat
prices sky hiph and it mÂ»y come before
the next crop is ready.
In the ta6k of restoring prosperity the
people have a responsibility hardly less
than that of the Government.
No one objects to Cleveland's duck
shooting trip this time. We have in
Washington a much better man to attend
to business.
This ought to be a great year for carni
vals in this country, as the people were
never more joyous or more in a mood to
have a jubilee.
No objection was made in the Senate to
any member of McKinley's Cabinet ex
cept Bliss, and yet everybody knows that
where there is harmony there is sure to be
bliss.
Since a war against her has been raised
in the Caroline Islands as well as in Cuba
and the Philippines, Spain will have
reason to believe that all islands are of
a volcanic nature.
Not a sinele sentence in McKinley's
message tends to stir up strife among the
people. It said the right things in the
riebt way and appeals to the sentiments
of all patriotic people.
The story that microbes four inches
long have been found in Chicago water
was probably staried by some visitor to
the city who drank so much Chicago beer
that he was unaole to tell the difference
between a microbe and a sausage.
The Boston Transcript says that tbe
seven wonders of America are Niagara
Falls, Yosemite Valley, Mammoth Cave,
Muir Glacier, Natural Bridge. Yellowstone
Park and the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado. The list is good, but why Kansas
was left out is another wonder.
According to Mr. Prater of St. Louis,
the time is soon corning when farmers
will receive about $25 per acre for their
cornsta.ks after tbe corn and fodder have
been stripped from them. The stalks, he
says, will be used in making cellulose,
celluloid, smokeless gunpowder, lacquer,
cattle feed, roofing maierial and a material
that will answer every purpose of papier
macbe.
At the recent municipal elections in
Philadelphia five women were elected to
the school board, so that now there are
eleven women >n that body representing
nine out of the thirty-eight wards of the
city. The success of the women is re
garded by the press of Philadelphia as a
matter for congratulation, and the predic
tion is made that before long every ward
will have at least one woman to represent
it as a school director.
A few years ago some enterprising roan
brought water hyacinths from Venezuela
as a fine plant to adorn the grounds of
one of the big hotels in Florida. The
plant got into the rivers of the State and
thrived like the rabbit in Australia. It
now impedes navigation on such impor
tant streams as the St. Jonn, and serves
as another warning to man not to be too
hasty in propagating either plants or ani
mals in lands where nature has not placed
them.
Senator Wolcott, who has just returned
from Europe, says: "An international
agreement for theremonetization of silver
is entirely feasible, and its accomplish
ment rests largely with the United Stales
and is dependent on the course wo pur
sue." This statement is encouraging, and
taken in connection with McKinley's
promise that Internationa! bimetallism
will have early attention gives hope that
this issue in like the tar.ff â will soon be
nut of po.itics.
PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY.
In the beginning of this new administration and in the efforts mado tc hasten the
coining of a new era of prosperity, it must be borne in mind that the people have a
responsibility hardly less than that imposed upon Congress and the President. To
achieve the best results from the legislation which ia expected.it is essential that
tnere should be harmony among classes of citizens and cordial co-operation in the
task of restoring public confidence and upbuilding the industries of the country.
We rightly count upon Congress to act promptly in adopting a new tariff which
will provide an adequate revenue to the Government md afford protection lo Ameri
can labor. We expect tne Senate &â¢> well as the House to be prompt in enacting the
new measure. Wiiile we have these expectations, it is only right that we should act
in accordance with them. It will be in vain to look for harmony in Congress if there
is no harmony among the people. If dissensions exist among citizens they are cer
tain to be reflected and possibly exaggerated at Washington, and the result will be
discord and antagonisms which will seriously impair the force even if they do not
wholly baffle all efforts made to provide the much needed legislation.
In a particular degree the newspapers of the country are charged with responsibil
ity at this time. They should give to the Government every support required for the
best results and should abstain from all attacks of a mere partisan or factional char
acter. The new tariff snould not be assailed as the work of spoilsmen and corpora
tions; it should not be denounced as favoritism shown to the, rich against the poor.
No attempt should be made to prejudice the public mind against it in advance. On
the contrary the press should wait until the tariff bill is presented before it enters
upon the work of criticising it, and even then the comments should bo directed to the
end of making it in every way beneficial to the welfare of the people. There will be
room enough for legitimate criticism in pointing out how particular schedules may
possibly be changed to advantage, without resorting to mere partisan attacks and de
nunciations designed for no other purpose than that of discrediting the bill and ex
citing the passions of the ignorant and the prejudices of one class of men against
another. â 
The new administration ought to be for America the beginning of an era of good
feeling. It ought to see the end of those prolonged antagonisms over economic ques
tions which have disturbed the country ever since the appearance ol Grover Cleve
land in public life. The time has come when labor and capital, rich and poor, debtor
and creditor should work together. We have passed through a most disastrous expe
rience. Every one now recognizes the supreme importance of reviving the industries
of the country and furnianing employment to labor. The people and the press at
well as Congress should recognize their responsibility at this juncture. Trie time has
come for harmony and co-operation. Let us act together, and in a time much sooner
than is expected in some quarters we shall achieve a return to prosperity and restore
the normal conditions of American life.
VICIOUS JOURNALISM.
In the great cities of Europe and of the
East the attention of students of social
topic 3 has been called to the extraordinary
increase in recent years of jnvenile crime.
In New York this phase of depravity has
been startling, and there has been much
discussion concerning the cause of it, ana
the best methods of remedying the evil.
The course of the discussion has made
clear the fact that all investigators are
agreed that the chief if not the sole cause
of the increase of crime among juveniles
is due to a crime-lovinE and crime-pro
ducing newspaper press. Mr. Gerry, presi
dent of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, in New York City, in
discussing the extraordinary increase of
child criminals in that community, says:
The first course of their training in vice is
â¢what may well be called vioious journalism.
Lurid stories of crime, illustrated by vivid
pictures representing criminals In daring and
attractive attitudes; descriptions of criminals
arrested for gross immoralities, with the like
pictorial illustrations; narratives of these and
especially of children charged with crime,
where all the details are elaborated witn the
greatest care, with their pictures often of a
salacious character, malting a deep-seated and
deep-rooted impression. Anyone conversing
with children held for crime may soon learn
whence the suggestions of crime ere derived.
They are only too ready to talk on the subj -ct,
and frequently to compare their exploits with
those chronicled in these newspaper!.
This presents a new chase of the evils of
decadent journalism. The wrong done to
society by such papers as the New York
Jvurnal and the Ban Francisco Examiner
has been repeatedly made known. So of
fensive have these papers become to
decent people that in New York a bill has
been introduced Into the Legislature to
prevent the publication of the pictures of
citizens without their consent. This bill,
which seems a blow at the liberty of the
press, is cordially supported by many of
the leading pupers in New York on the ex
press ground that decadent journalism has
carried liberty to such a d gree of license
that the welfare and decency of society re
quire some restriction upon the privileges
which have been hitherto accorded to
American newspapers.
The support given to the New York bill
shows that decadent journalism is danger
ous to the press inasmuch as it threatens
to compel the public to seriously restrict
the freedom which journalism has 10..g en
joyed. The newspaper profession there
fore even more than society generally has
reason to denounce, condemn and use ail
its efforts to force these foul and effensive
journals out of the ranks of the profes
sion. Society at large, however, will find
in tho reports of the increase of juvenile
crime sufficient rÂ»ason why it should co
operate with legitimate newspapers in the
war against fake and foul journalism, and
for that reason we call par:icular attention
to the discussion now going on in New
York and to the statement quoted from
President Gerry.
The remedy for the evil is well stated
by the New York Post:
The press will never become moral or decent
by dint of exhortation. The only argument
that can reach it, short of a severe penal
statute, Is tho argument of the almighty
dollar. Cut off the profits of crime-breeding
newspapers and you would be surprised to see
how moral they would become. We do not
propose to waste any breath on newspaper
proprietors. It is to the general public, to the
Christian men and women who buy their
daily poison, to the business men and philan
thropists who keep their wretched and in
fectious sheets alive by advertising in them,
that the appeal should be ma.le. Theirs is the
responsibility and in their hands 1b the
remedy.
NEW CHEMISTRY Of FARMING
The study of bacteria is continually
magnifying our knowledee of the im
portant part these tiny microbes perform
in the works of nature. After the won
derful revelation of the nature of various
diseases, never understood till this micro
scopic life was scientifically observed, we
were next surprised by the accounts of the
skilled cultivation of choice breeds of
bacteria for use in produring butter of
surpassing flavor and keeping qualities.
Ab if wonders are never to cease, now
comes Dr. Henry W. Wiley, chief of the
division of chemistry in the Federal De
partment of Agriculture, to tell us that
bacteria are busy in all agricultural soils
preparing plant food, and that the roots of
our growing crops do not and cannot
directly take up ti>e mineral substance of
the soil and organize it into plant life.
This curious fact was explained in a
lecture recently delivered by Dr. Wiley to
the chemical section of the Frantlin In
stitute upon the subject of "Soil Ferments
Important in Agriculture." He stated
that the old idea that the soil is an inert
mass of mineral matter has given way to
the new conception of the soil as a living
organism, and that the production of
arable soil is known to be largely due to
the activities of certain forms of bacteria,
which decompose the inert mineral sub
stances. In addition to the minute or
ganisms which dissolve the soil particles
there are others active in preparing or
ganic food for absorption and assimila
tion by plants.
This discovery has already been found
to be of great practical importance. It

was learned tnat the microbes worked by
a process called nitrification, whicL is the
conversion of ammonia and its compounds
into nitrous acid, and ironi & study of the
successive steps in this operation it was
deduced that nitrogenous fertilizers
should be applied in moderate quantities.
Practical results have also been obtained
by the artificial production of a breed of
bacteria which have the power of absorb
ing free nitrogen from the air and present
ing it in available form for the plants.
Some years ago Dr. Wiley predicted the
farmer would soon be supplied by the
chemist's laboratory with the bacteria
suitable for growing his crops, and last
year a nitrifying ferment was produced
called "nitragin," which is sown on the
crops and greatly facilitates their growth.
The rapid advance of science in compre
hending nature's secrets promises such an
increase of man's dominion of the earth
that the next century may be bringing us
such a submission of matter to mind as
will make life royally rich to all but the
wicked ana the lazy. This new Knowl
edge of the chemistry of farming may be a
long step toward such scientific agriculture
as will make the means of sustenance so
abundant all men will have time for much
beyond the vror 1 ? of earn ng a living.
EXCLUDED.
It will be seen by our Oregon dispatches
of this morning that the trustees of the
library of Portland have excluded the Ex
aminer from that institution on the ground
that it is unfit to ba read. The state
ments of the trustees show tnat the action
was not taken hastily nor without due
consideration. Their attention having
been called to the character of the paper
by the procests against it in legitimate
journals, the trustees investigated it and
found that the charges were well founded
and that the Examiner is really too inde
cent to be allowed a place in their public
reading-room.
The action taken by tbe Portland library
is doubly satisfactory inaÂ«much as it not
only puts the stamp of official condemna
tion on decadent journalism, but shows
that the earnest protests of legitimate
journals have had weight in impressing
upon the public mmd the extent of the
evil influence of such vile, vulgar and
venal publications. It is also gratifying
to learn that public opinion in Portland
strongly sustains the action of the trus
tees. The exclusion of the disreputable
sheet is everywhere approved, and ample
evidence is given that in Portland at any
rate the sensational sms and indecencies
o: decadent journalism are condemned as
they should be.
It is only a question of time when the
example set in Portland will be followed
elsewhere. It is indeed probable that bs
fore long such papers will be excluded
from the mails. The benefits which Son
Francisco and California would derive
irom such exclusion are many. The whole
State suffers from the foul and false
stories which the Examiner tends abroad.
It injures the repute of the City and the
State wherever it goes. It defames one haif
the people in order to corrupt the other
balf. The trustees of the Portland Library
have done well for California, therefore,
as well as for Portland in excluding the
slum journal from the reading-room and
the tiles.
WORK TOR THE PEOPLE.
President McKinley has shown a true
appreciation of the c ndition of the coun
try by stating in his ituuigura. address
that the responsibilities of the high office
he has assumed are augmented at the
present time "by the prevailing busi
ness conditions, entailing idleness upon
willing labor and loss to useful enter
prise." He has furthermore shown a
statesmanlike capacity in dealing with
the-te evils by the remedies which ne pro
poses for them.
Expressed in its simplest terms the
policy winch the President urges upon
Congress is the adoption of a tariff which
will furnish an adequate revenue to the
Government and afford work for the un
employed.
It is an illustration of McKinley's inter
est in American labor that in the course
of his address he gave more consideration
to the problem of giving employment to
American labor than to that of providing
a revenue for the Nation. Each is, of
course, important, ana the fact is well un
derstood by the President, but neverthe
less be devoted more of his address to the
welfare of the people than he did to the
National revenues. He knows that when
the home is prosperous the Republic is
prosperous, and that the best way to se
cure National welfare is to provide for the
personal prosperity of every industrious
citizen.
"The depression of the past four years,"
says the President, "has fallen with a spe
cial severity upon the great body of the
toilers of the country, and upon none
more than the holders of small farms.
Agriculture has languished and labor
suffered. 1 ' He urges therefore measures
which will promote the interests of the
farmers and secirre to labor the oppor
tunities of earning the wages to which it
is entitled. He strikes directly at the evil
which affects the country. He aims in a
broad National way to give work to the
unemployed.
It is evident that this is to be in the full
sense of the word a workingruan's ad
ministration. Us most careful thought
and its strongest energies will be direc ed
to procuring for theÂ°An>prican working
man "an honest dollar and the chance to
earn it." To provide work for the work
ers will be the chief object of McKinley's
care. He has ever been known as the
champion of the workingznan, and with
proper support from Congress can be
counted on to do much to provide oppor
tunities for labor and to carry comfort
into every home.
What is done for the workers will be
done for the community at large. As the
President said in his inaugural address,
"Legislation helpful to producers is bene
ficial to all." His administration there
fore means first of all work for the work
ers, and secondly the improvement of
trade. These are the things the country
most needs, and every class and condition
of people may therefore rejoice in the ac
cession to office of the new aJministration,
and find gratification in the policy it has
outlined for the country.
THE AGEICULTUEAL OUTLOOK
At no time during the history of Cali
fornia has the agricultural outlook of the
Stat- been so completely dependent upon
the action of Coneress. Several years of
free trade in some lines of produce and of
a tariff so low on others that it is almost
equivalent to free trade have served to un
duly depress these lines, not only in Cali
fornia, but throughout the United States.
The wooi-crowers of the country have
been practically ruined, barley is away be
low what it ought to be selling for to-day,
dried fruits are too cheap for profitable
production, and so on down through a
list of productions, all of which are di
rectly or indirectly affected by the present
tariff.
Tnere never was a better outlook for the
farmer, as far as abundance of crops is
concerned, than at this moment. The
winter has been remarkably propitious.
It has been neither too wet nor too dry,
neither too cold nor too warm. The
farmer has had exceptional opportunities
for getting in his crops to the best advan
tage. As the result a vast acreage has
been sown to hay and grain and the plant
looks well everywhere. Fruit-growers
point to the remarkable showing of fruit
buds in their orchards.
If no unforeseen disaster occurs the out
put of the great grain and fruit staples
this year will be enormous. Nature i 3 do-
ing her part, and it only remains for Con
gress to perform its own in the matter to
bless the State with one of the most pros
perous years in its history, if Congress
places a reasonable tariff on those prod
ucts that need it the work is accom
plished.
An additional import duty of, say, 2
cents per pound on prunes makes no dif
ference to the average consumer, but it
means great rewards for the grower. Two
cents per pound means the payment of
his labor bills, material, taxes and inter
est. It represents the difference between
profit and loss. It means that he will Bell
his prunes at 4]4 cents per pound instead
of 2)4 cents, and that at the end of the year
he will find a satisfactory profit to show
for his investment. With the wool
grower the case is even more pronounced.
A suitable tariff on wool means to him
the difference between independence and
bankruptcy or between financial life and
death. It means the resuscitation of a
paralyzed industry. And so on down the
list.
The indications are that Coneress will
revise the tariff on these lines. If it does,
prosperity immediately smiles on the
California agriculturist. True, he is better
off to-day than his fellow-farmer of the
Eastern States, but times are not as good
with him as they were under a protective
tariff, and he knows it. Accordingly his
voice is heard in the land demanding pro
tection, and the chances are that he will
got it. If he does he again becomes the
most prosperous farmer in the world.
As for wheat, the outlook for this chief
staple is good. While no leading operator
will hazard an opinion as to future p-ic>B,
the general opinion among the best-posted
men in the trade is that win o quotations
may be lower during the harvest season
than they are now, nobody expects that
ihey will fall to the low level of eeveral
years ago. In other words, no intelligent
man in the trade expects to see wheat
again down to ttie cost of production for
some time to come. As to future quota
tions, it is merely a question as to per
centage of profit. At present values wheat
is a profitable crop.
Hence, as far as present indications go,
the agricultural outlook for California this
year is good. If Congress gives the farmer
his tariff it will he much better.

SMALL-CALiBER RiFLES.
The adoption of the small -ca'.ibor maenzine
rifle by the different nations hrs been proba
bly the most marked change in infantry equip
ment of ihe past decadeâ in fact amounting
a most to a revolution. France initiated the
new movement, to be followed in rapid suc
cession by the other nations. This, with the
simultaneous adoption of smokeless powder,
has become a great factor in altering the
tactics not only of Infantry but of cavalry and
artillery as well, since tactical formations
must always depend primarily on the kind of
arm used by the enemy and by ourselves.
The new rifle gives a higher velocity to the
bullet and longer range. As a further result
of the Increased velocity we have a flatter
trajectory, which in turn has increased the
deadly zone to 400 ynrds, and the danger zone,
or space within wnich the bullet in its flight
does not rise ab>ve a man's head, is now thrice
that distance. At 7300 yards, or over four
miles, the bullets still have velocity enough to
cause severe injury.
But. possibly, the most marked effect at
tendant on the introduction of the new small
caliber arm is in the number of rounds carried
by the goldier. Where formerly the infantry
soldier could carry but seventy rounds, and
often went into battle with only twenty rounds
in his cartridge-box, he now carries 150
rounds or more. The German soldier on going
into battle will have on his person 200 rounds,
with 100 rounds more immediately available
in the ammunition train. This, combined
with the facility of rapid firing afforded by
the magazine principle, has greatly compli
cated the question of ammunition supply to
the line of battle.
Fra discipline, always so important, has
now become doubly so. Undisciplined or raw
troops are especially liable to waste their am
munition, and lack of ammunition wtfl doubt
less decide many battles in the future.
The Krag-Jortrensen rifle, with which the
army is now equipped, h-s a caliber of .30
inch, being about a medium between those of
other powers. The navy, in the selection of a
new arm, seems to have gone to an extreme in
the adoption of the Lee rifle with a caliber of
only .236 inch. The reason for the adoption
of a different caliber from that inuseinlhe
army is not apparent, especially ns grave
doubts exist whether in the .30-caliber the
limit has not been passed and a j oint reached
where ihe "stopping power" of the bullet has
Deen sacrificed to a reduction in weight find
increase of number of rounds to be carried
A resolution recently introduced Into Con
â¢ gress is designed to threw light on the ques
tion.
It would seem that both army and navy
should not onlyjtiavo the samecaliber but the
same rifle. Occasions may easily arise where
in joint operations of Ihe army and navy It
may be necessary for one department to call
upon the other for a supply of arms and am
munition. The navy especially should always
be able to replenish iU supply of small-arm
ammunition at any of our coast forts, to the
vicinity of which its ves-eis would naturally
conic. The matter of uniform calibers and
ammunition for heavy guns afloat and ashore
is quite a d:flerent quo.-tion, but it is to be
hoped tnat the army and navy may soon agree
on the same caliber for small arms, as they
hava already decided on a uniform code of
signals by flag or otherwise-
It Is designed to make Fort Wadsworth, at
the entrance to New York harbor, a type fort.
Here will soon be installed a type system for
the control of heavy artillery fire.
The solution ot this problem, the import
lance of which in sea-coast defense is second
only to that of guns and forts, has been in
trusted to the Board on the Regulation of Sea
coast Artillery Fire. This board is composed
of artillery officers of the highest ability and
the subject has received the careful and pro
longed stuay which its importance demands.
The result will be a system of tactics for heavy
artillery designed to realize from the guns
their maximum effect in actiou.
The new Army Register for 1897 shows a
total of 2145 officers on the active list, divided
into 532 staff and 1613 line. The latter is
composed or 445 cavalrj-, 288 artillery and 880
infantry officers. Of the total number 31 are
"additional second lieutenants, graduates of
West Point, appointed in excess of the normal
number, and indue time to be appointed as
full second lieutenants.
Of the "old army" who served "befo' de
wah" GO still remain on the active list, while
46 officers appear as having served more than
twenty ytars in oue grade. Of ihese, 14 are
first lieu tenants of artillery, 6 of whom served
during the War of the Rebellion. Surely, pro
motion in the United States army in time of
peace is not so rapid as to be especially dtu
zling!
A new act of Congress authorizes officers now
In the regular service and who served in the
war of the rebellion to bear the title and on
occasions of ceremony to wear the uniform of
the highest rank held by them. At the termi
nation of the war many meritorious volunteer
officers were given commissions in the regular
service, but necessarily of a much lower grade
than in their volunteer service. General
Miles, now at the head of the army, after
serving as major-general of volunteers, was
made colonel of an infantry regiment. To
prevent contusion a law was finally passed
prohibiting an officer from using or being ad
dressed by any titie except that pertaining to
his actual rank. Owing to changes and pro
motions the new law will affect comparatively
few officers now in the service, but notably in
the case of a number of captains who will now
become "major" and of a few first lieutenants
of artillery who will henceiorth be entitled to
wear the gold ieai.

KARMA. A STUDY OF THIS LAW OF CATJSE
ASDEFFEUI- By Jerome A. Anderson, M.1).,
F.T.S. Published by The Lotus Publishing
Company, 1170 Market street, San Francisco.
Price $1.
"From the blossoming of a daisy to the up
heaval of a continent everything is law-gov
erned." If one were lorced to condense to a
single simple sentence the entire purport of
Dr. Anderson's new book, "Karma," he could j
scarcely do better than quote the foregoing
words,- taken from page 29. And then, if a
very brief and comprehensive explanation of
this law were demanded, one could, with ad
vantage, quote again irom the same page:
"And the effects seen are either harmonic or
are but the effort of nature to restore disturbed
harmonic conditions." One might go further,
were it necessary, and say that "Karma" seeks
to show that "All is governed by law."
Cause and effect is- one definition of karma,
but hardly a complete one, for the Western
world knows the law of cause and effect merely
as a physical law. Science itself will not dis
pute that ''the blossoming of a daisy" or "the
upheaval of a continent" is under the law of
cause and effect. But here science and the
Western world halt, while the author of
"Karma" and a good many other thoughtful
men and women go several steps farther and
declare that the law of cause and effect is con
scious, though insensible and impersonal; that
it rules upon all planes of nature, animate and
inanimate, physical, mental, psychic and spir
itual; that it deals exact justice to every being,
though there be thousands of years between
the sowing of the cause and the reaping of the
effect ; that it is greater than love, because love
can only be known by contrast with hate; that
it is more compassionate than mercy, because
exact justice is the greatest compassion; that
it is Infinite, unfallng and extends beyond time
and eternity, being the law of an uncognizable
God, around whose pavilion there is eternal
darkness to mortal ken.
Karma is a good English word now and has
corqe into all the new dictionaries. It came
in about the time that the word "altruism"
began to be recognized by the lexicographers.
And though the two words have none or but
scant philological relationship they go hand
in hand and are used much by the same class
of writers. The author of "Karma" uses "al
truism" often, and seeks to show that only by
a thorough understanding of the nature of the
former can the ideals oi the latter be e\^n ao
proximately attained. In its truest sense al
truism means brotherhood, and brotherhood
Is but a sentiment, says the author, to those
who do not realiz3 that men are brothers in
fact because they are but aifferentiatled rays of
the divine and conscious whole.
Ttie author of "Karma," it need scarcely be
said, is a theosopuist of high standing and
also a director in the School for the Revival of
the Lost Mysteries of Antiquities, at Point
Loma. Being a theosophist his explanation
cf the manifested universe is: The result of
an external differentiation forever taking place
within Absolute Unity, that which differen
tiates being Its two great aspects, conscious
ness and substance.
Under the law of karma (known on the
pliysicnl plane as the law of cause and effect
this differentiation takes plac â¢- And there is
nothing outside of Absolute Unity nor noth
log beyond the range of karma. Hence there
Is nothing outside of nature, nothing can be
6upen.atural or beyond nature and nothing
cp.ii happen that is not the effect of an ade
quate cause.
To those familiar with only Western thou?nt,
logic, philosophy and religions, it is difficult
to perceive the justice or the adequate cause
under.ying the hard luck and seemingly unde
served misfortune that follows John Smith
through life, or the good luck and smiling for
tune that ever waits upon the career of such a
hard-hearted, unscrupulous man as Thomas
Smith.
But the author does not find the same dif
ficulty in the treatment of his subject, for ho
declares that man lives many lives on this
earth and that the condition which John
Smith find? himself in now is but the result of
the acts and thoughts of his previous life. It
does not follow, of course, that John Smith
was necessarily an evil man in his last liie; it
may only be :hat he neglected to round out
certain portions of his character which are
now being filled in by his pn-sent experi
ences. This is reincarnation, and â It may oe
stated as well first as lastâ that unless one can
accept the rationale of reincarnation, one can
scarcely see the eternal fitness of things in
Karma. For on the face of things the worid is
unjust, and only to those who are willing to
uk* more than a cursory view of life will the
law that "Whatsoever a man soweth thatsbali
he also reap" become a practicable and guid
ine truth.
"Karma," from a literary standpoint, is the
best of Dr. Anderson's works, and tliat is say
ing a good deal for the artistic merit of it.
Though philosophical it is not abstruse, and
there is much good taste and earnest elo
quence in the composition. It will doubtless
be' read and valued by many more than those
who may agree with all it premises.

LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE.
OX MANY SEAS-By Frederick Benton Wil

Hotel, C :y, the Emporium iiook Department

"A sailor's life, by a sailor." These half
dozen words form an exact estimate of a book
recently published by the Macmillan Com
pany of New York and entitled "On Many
Seas." The adventures 'herein narrated read
so much like the record of past events that
one would almost ike to take them us history;
but fact or fiction "Oa Many Seat." is one of
the best nautical stories we have read in
years, and its author and editor are to be
congratulated upon having furnished the
reading public with something breezy in that
class oi literature, where it is exceptionally
difficult to find novel and entertaining
matter.
There are not many who can tell a pleasing
â¢tory, like this, in the first person, but the few
who can are able thus to throw a charm of
vivid actuality about tne tale which makes us
heed with a more lively attention than can be
aroused by any other method of telling, which
is like hearsay evidence compared to tne testi
mony of one wh j has seeu und heard, and
knows. Tne rightful aud deep dislike of ego
tism produces, by an association of ideas, a
prejudice which makes it difficult, even in
fiction, to use the pronoun "1" without of
fense, but when we find a talker or a writer
with the rare gifi of so using n that our in
terest in the story makes all thought of ego
tism sink out of mind, how close to
our lives his story comes. "This with
my own eyes I saw; thus in my
own heart I fe.t; through such experiences I,
a human like as you are, actually passed."
These ar3 moving considerations, and our
gympatny, when adventures are so narrated,
takes us out of ourselves to follow the nar
rator through the thrilling scenes. So it is in
this tale of a life spent "On Many Seas." end
Euch may in part explain the book's sudden
success. It was electrotvped in December,
1896, and in February, 1897, a second edition
was printed.
The style of telling this story is unostenta
tious; It is simplicity itself. The editor
of the booi, William Stane Booth, had
often listened with great pleasure to the sea
man telling the disconnected yarns, and r.fter
a good deal of persuasion got him to write
them all down ia Ms own words. Tae editor' c
task was merely one of elimination to get
them into a book of reasonable size.
The seaman, Williams, seems t> have been
born with a disposition to rove. He was but a
child when his father moved to New York,
and the first thing tho youngster did was to
disobey the injunction to stay close at home,
anJ he started out on a trip to inspect the big
city and of course got lostf Instead of going
to the polic? for aid, he had a terror of them
and ran away whenever one came near him.
When he got a little older he took a dislike to
his stepmother and fled to Maine to try the
fa-ciuations of farm life.
He soon found there was no romance in that
and decided ;o go to sea. The overpowering
motive in his first resolve to leave the f aim
was that a young companion proposed that
they run away, and Williams did not want to
shirk anything thut seemed to require nerve
to do. The boys balKed in their first effort to
getaway. A kind uncle persuaded Williams
to go back and consult his father before ha
went to s;a. When he got home his mother
in-law greeted him with the affectionate ex
clamation, "Well, what in the world did you
come back for ?" This mÂ«nner of welcoming
him home made him Btill more determined to
put to sea.
He first shipped on a little schooner bound
for Feruandina, Ha. In the captain of this
boat he found a man who would not keep a
youngster hungry fcr adventures long in de
privation. Tnere was soon a great gale bow
inn and the steward gave Williams the cheer
ing news that if the wind did not moderate or
shiit the young sailor's carcass would be roll
ing in the surf before another morring
dawned. The captain met the challenge of the
breeze by hoisting more sail, and made the
little schooner leap more than half her length
out of ;he water ever time she rose on a sea.
He made her dance, and at every plunge she
would bury nor bowsprit, "and the water in
the lee was as green as it was over the side. "
Williams overheard the mato say to the cap
tain, "If you don't take some of this sail off
her she will start a butl and go down like a
stone." The bold skipper gave this prompt
reply, "And if Ido take any of it off her she
wiil wrecjc on Hatteras before 10 o'clock to
night; she is hardly holding her own now.
No, sir; if she can't live through this breeze
let her go to h flying."
Such is the adventurous start of our young
hero on a seafaring career, and this vigorous
swing to his story-telling is well sustained
throughout, as with varied fortune ne voy
aees over many seas. Ho made up his mind
I in the beginning to become a captain, but
when he thought of all he would have to
learn it made him "iired beforehand." Down
j on the Florida coast the ship's cook became
I disabled and the captain made Williams cook.
[ Wlien he objected, the captain assured him
j that a cook was an officer on board a ship, and
it was an honor to hold that position.
Williams went at it with a vigor, and was
soon grease and soot from head to foot; but
tne meals were never ready on time nor fit to
eat when they were ready. One day a big
Swede came to the kitchen bringing a sample
biscuit, which he complained was more fit for
a deep sea lead that for human food. Our hero
was nor, tired, dirty, disgusted. In language
more emphatic than polite he requested the
Swede to travel to I'luto's realm. "You tell
me that, you dirty swab," said the Swede, and
he put his foot inside the galley door.
Williams knew that the cook's galley was
his castle, and he grabbed the potato-masher
and made a lick intended to mash the in
vader's head; but by a lurch, lucky or un
lucky, of the schooner, the missile failed of its
mark. A few days a;ter the disagreement the
big Swede, who had in the interval made up
with Williams, came to the galley door with his
tin plate, and as it was a very cold morning
he asked that the cook have something hot
for him when he came from the wheel.
The cook told him all right, and when he
heard him coming for his breakfast he put a
Bhovelful of fire in his pan and covered it with
a tin pie-plate. When the hungry Swede en
tered Williams set the hot plates on his two
open palms. Then there was war again.
There is an interesting description of the
way in -^hica the trained elephants in the
East pile lumber and are bossed by a big ele
phant foreman, who carries a short chain to
punish those in his gang who disobey the
rules. And there is a good yarn of the East
ern seas about one Mike, au American sailor,
who was wrecked with a lot oi Portuguese.
Far out at sea iv an open boat he could hear
the starving aliens talking suspiciously in a
tongue uukoown to him, and he fancied they
eyed him with an appetite for American meat
that grew ever keener and keener as the pass
ing hours made the pangs of hunger more im
perative.
Years afterward, it is related, Mike would
have nightmare dreams of this terrible inci
dent in his life, and Williams gently hints a
suspicion that there was some norror con
nected with the escape which Mike never
confessed. Could it be possible that the
time-honorea custom of casting lots in such
emergencies was resorted to and that Mine eat
one of the I'ortuguese who had beeu watch
ing him so hungrily?
Tbese are brief samples of his rich experi
ences, but the telling of amusing yarns is not
the sole excellence of the book. There is a
splendid description of an encounter with
icebergs in the Antarctic seas and a thrilling â 
escape from being crushed between colliding:
ice mountains that loomed up tail as the sky.

â a.c by William Doiey, Palace Hotel, City.
This little book contains a number 01 short,
sad sketches of lives whose usefulness or hap
piness has been wrecked. There is an ad
mirable brevity in the way these tragedies
present their leading features and the lesson
they teach is quickly grasped. The warning
to those who by their evil deeds hurt not only
themselves but others is given with much
force, but there is a tcne to the book which
gives the impression that the writer attributes
all the wrong of these failures to the first
movers in evil, who put pain upon those
who tave been honest, kind and true.
There 'is no hint of blame for those who
weakly and willfully refuse to bear in a proper
spirit the burden of unhapplness thrust upon
them by the misdeeds of others, and thus per
baps criminally permit their lives to become
wrecked from mere lack of fortitude, which
would have carried them through the rough
est day to a usefulness and happiness beyond
the trial.

And a secret purpose of glory In every part,

To thrill with the Joy of girded men,
To go on forever and fail, and go on again,
And be mau'.ed to the earth and arise,
And contend for the shade of a word and a

A Dreamer.
He is a dreamer; let him pass.
He reads the writing In the grass;
His seeing soul in lapture goes
Beyond the beauty of the rose.
He is a dreamer and doth know
To sound the furthest depth ot woe;
pleasure, but soon tires of that and goes to
work.
But It is unscrupulous work to amass a for
tune. He succeeds, but he finds no happiness.
The condensed substance of what his book
conveys to his son is that there is but one
creed for men, tne cardinal principle of all
faiths, unobscured by superstition or ritualâ
the religion of right and wrong. "Think care
fully and you will be unable to discover any
act of sin which is not a violation of a fellow
creature's rights." To strive to live without
thus sinning be tells his son is life's problem.
This religion of life sought to be impressed
upon the son for whom the story purports to
be written is good enough so far as it goes, but
it does not go near far enough. It acknowl
edges no obligations of worship and love to
the Supreme Being, which is the greater part
of religion. That is the first and great com
mandment. The otber one taught by this
book is like unto it, but it is only secondary,
and to seek to separate it from its companion
and greater law and have It stand alone as a
guide to life is false philosophy.

He dreams of love, and life and death.
Oh, man! Oh woman ! lad or lass,
He is a dreamer, let him pass.
T. P. O'Connor's London Sun. â 
The Whale and the Creed.
Religious fights I always did bewail;
'Tis something that I never take a start in.
I hate to see good people rant and rail
Of things on which no one should feel too
"sartin."
So this dispute ' twin Jonah and the whale
It's hard to see bow one can take much
heart in,
And get his feelings all torn up and nettled
About a thing that never can be settled.
I have a friend as old as he can be;
His legs are wobbly and his head is hoary â
Who in a thuusand ways has shown to me
A faith implicit in the Jonah story;
His old wife with him scarcely can agree;
She says it is an ancient allegory,
And he. in peace, permits his wife to doubt it,
Though years ago they quarreled some about it.
The Bible is a book that I adore
For precepts found within its sacred pages.
Oft when I'm sad I turn its pages o'er
And readthe record of departed sages;
Thackeray was; but his father considered him
a great man, and that was enough for The
Boy. He did pay particular attention to Mr.
Thackeray with his eyes and his ears, and one
morning Mr. Thackeray paid a little attention
to him of which he is proud indeed. Mr.
Thackeray took The Boy between his knees
and asked his name, and what he intended to
be when he grew up. Ha replied, -"A farmer,
sir." Why, he cannot imagine, for he never
had the slightest inclination toward a farm
er's life. And then Mr. Thackeray put his
gentle hand upen The Boy's little red head
and said, "Whatever you are, try to Oe a good
one."
If there is any virtue in the laying on of
hands The Boy can only hope that a little of
it has descended upon him.
And whatever The Boy is. he has tried for
Thackeray's sake "to be a good one."

Mr, Stead, determined on introducing jrood

The Academy finds fault with what are
called "cross headings." In the journalistic
craft "cross headings" are lines of small
capitals wh.ch break up the long columns of
matter. In a poem tnose "cross headings''
would be singularly out of place. Suppose one
were tÂ© subject Longfellow's "Excelsior" to
this kind of chopping up into bits, as "The
Flag He Carried." "The Sort of Man He Was,"
"What the Old Chap Said," "The Maiden Does
the Talking," "Where the Dog Comes In,"
and, finally, "What He Shouted."
How indescribably funny Is that idea of
Charles Lamb which Thomas Hood remem
bered and described. The subject was about
the strange notions some very matter-of-fact
people lorm of the jgys of heaven. Charles
But matters in dispute, alas, no more
My wayworn and distracted mind engages
Like Jonah and the whale and Noah's landing
And things that tax my feeble understanding.
I read instead what I can understand.
The story of a Father's love, undying.
The promise of anotner, better land
Beyon i this vale of pain and want and
sighing,
A mansion in a city great and grand,
The glory of man's highest art outvying,
Where wickedness can come to torture never
And weary souls can rest in peace forever.
And while I don't bank much on any creed
And doctrines taught by schools ecclesiastic,
I gather comfort from the things I read ;
It makes my heart more mellow-like and
plastic.
I cannot follow where some teachers lead,
Nor take their theologic potions drastic;
And this is all my creed, awake or sleeping,
The Lord is good, and I am in his keeping.

Wild Is the sea and dark when night befalleth,
In unknown tongues breaker to breaker
caileth;
With murmurs as of menace and foreboding
Groan the black waves beneath the grim
wind's goading.
Yet passing lights may shine with friendly
seeming,
And from the pharos tower long rays are
streaming;
And songs of mnriner9 are blithe to hall
The rising anchor or tne spreading sail.
There is another sea which no man knoweth,
W'nereon with merchandise no captain goeth;
Unfathomed, uniilumined, and uncharted,
Whence never ship returns of all that started.
Yet where the distance darkens ever dimmer,
Dost thou not far discern a golden glimmer?
And down the fitful night-wind faintly
ringing,
Hearest thou not a strange triumphant
singing?

classmate of Robert Lincoln at Cambridge.
When Abraham Lincoln was running for Presi

lished in newspapers all over the country.
Robert cut out one of these pictures and
pasted it nn the outside of an envelope which
contained a letter to his father. The letter
reached Abraham Lincoln without losing a

the face represented in the woodcut.
Poetry does not always spell profit in the
dollar sense. William Morris left $225,000,

$5000, Christian Rossetti $65,000, Professor
Blakie $20,000, Dante Gabriel Rossetti
$25,000, Charles Mackay $13,000. The rich

LITERARY NOTES.
Mr. GladÂ«tone is about to bring out a second
series of books made up from his occasional
writings. Ti.e first volume will appear in the
spring.
F. Tennyson Neely has just published a
paper-covered edition oi Captain Charles
King's '-Fort Frayne," of the cloth edition of
which, he states, nine editions were sold
within a year.
During her stay in England Miss BeatriC9
Harraden will see through the press her Cali
fornia story, "Hilda Strafford," which ran
through Blackwood's Magazine last year.
Messrs. B'.ackwood will be the publishers in
this country, ani the volume will be issued
by them this month. The American edition,
published by Dodd, Mead & Co., Boston, will
appear at the same time.
Ouida has written a book called "The Mes
sarenes," which is said to be a new departure
for this clever, if eccentric, writer. The hero
cf the story emigrates to America, where he
accumulates a fortune by more or less ques
tionable means and returns to England to
spend it. The efforts of the millionaire and
his wife to buy their way into society are said
to be handled with a scathing pen.
We have received from the publisher, A. W.
Voorsanger, a copy of the Pacific Jewish An
nual. The work contains a good deal of in
formation touching communal institutions
founded by Hebrews of the Pacific Coast.
There are also added the usual calendar, list
of festivities, etc. The annual will be found
of considerable interest to members of the
Jewish faith resident in the State or upon the
coast. It is issued from the office of Emanu-El.
We learn that since the middle of November
last over 120,000 copies of J. M. Barrle's books
have been sold in England and the United
States, 100,000 of these being "Sentimental
Tommy" and "Margaret Ogilvy." It is said
that the sale of the latter book Jn England Is
only restricted by the difficulty In reproducing
the etched frontispiece portrait of Margaret
Ogilvy, which is printed in Paris and cannot
be supplied quickly enough to meet the de
mand for the book.
When "Tess of the D'Ubervllles" \ras first
published, it was generally agreed that it
contained material for a fine play. With the
author's consent, the play has been made by
Lorimer Stoddard, son of Richard Henry
Stoddard, who has done considerable literary
work already, and has had what many theat
rical managers regard as almost indispens
able in a writer for (he stageâ experience as
an actor. It will soon be produced In New
York by Mrs. Minnie Maddern Fiske, who will
appear in the title role.
The London Bookman says: "We understand
that the Clarendon Press are meditating a
groat and worthy enterprise, no iesa than a
complete and magnificent edition of the Brit
ish classics. The volumes will be produced in
sumptuous form, and as far as possible the
editing will be final. It is 100 soon as yet to
give exact particu ars, but It w'.ll be generally
felt that the Clarendon Press is taking a step
worthy of its greatest traditions in giving a
fittine and permanent form to tho classics of
Britain."
"Tatterley. the Story of a Dead Man." is thÂ©
title of a novel by a new writer, T. Gallon,
which is to appear shortly in Appleton'sTown
and Country Library. This curious and strik
ing story takes the reader out of the beaten
track of current fiction, and any prototype
which is suggested belongs to an earlier time.
The book will be found intensely interesting,
very vivid in its pictures of avarice and love,
the meaner pnssiona and the noblest senti
ments, and American readers are likely to
jun English critic 1 !; in predicting a brilliant
future for this new and talented writer.
The "College Yearbook," which Stone &
KimDall announced for publication last De
cember, has been delayed, and is now to be
issued. The delay was caused by the exceed
ing difficulty of collecting so varied a num
ber of interesting facts about the colleges of
America, including not only full lists of the
faculties of each institution, but the records
of the athletic and other contests, as well as
college societies, which go to ninko up this
volume. The book makes, altogether, about
600 pages, and will be of great interest not
only to students and instructors, but to those
preparing their sons and daughters for Col
lege.
Graduate Conrses, 1897-98, is the third issue
of a very valuable annual, which sets forth
compactly, bo that comparisons are easily
made, the special opportunities which our atf
ierent American universities offer to grad
uate students and specialists. Complete
lists of graduate courses to be offered
in all the leading universities, together
with statement of requirements for
degrees and for admission to advanced stand
ing; the fees asked of graduate students; the
scholarships or fellowships open to them; the
library or laboratory facilities; the numbers
of graduate students already connected with
each universityâ all of these things are con
cisely stated in these pages, so that it is offered
to ever.- intending student as a valuable
source of information.

British history is contrlbu:ed to the Review
of Reviews in this diamond jubilee year of
Queen Victoria's rule by W. T. Stead, who
traces the growth of imperial dominion and
the influence ol the royal family from ths
point of view of the typical British subject.
The article is illustrated with a largo number
ot portraits of the Queen and of members of
her family circle. Many of these portraits are
rare, and are now published for the first time
in America.
The "Critic's" Lounger gives a new view of
the^ publishing business in a couple of para
graphs on "Tne Book of Wealth"â a "sub
scription book," of which the ordinary edition
is to be sold at $1000, and the limited edition
at $2500. This book will chronicle the accom
plishments of wealth from the earliest days to
the present day, in all countries. He giyes ua
incidentally a description of the canvassers
who sell these books. Theirs is not the drudg
ery commonly associated with that profession :
"There are not more than half a dozen
men in the whole United States who
can sell these expensive books, and they
sell notning else. Their season ii short, but
their harvest is large. They live in the most
expensive hotels, and, instead of trudging
wearily from door to door, drive about in their
broughams, accompanied by a man servant
who carries the book. The latter is not
brought into the house until the possible
purchaserexpressesawish toseeit. One of tha
most successful of these agents told me re
cently that his season in New York did not be
gin till the Horse Show, and that it was over
by the first of June." Who would not be a
book canvasser under such conditions? The
Lounger adds that this particular book has
been subscribed for by more than half the
crowned heads of Europe.
Meesrs. D. Appleton & Co. announce for
early publication "Pioneers of Evolution,"
from Thales to Huxiey, by Edward Clodd;
"Memoirs of Marshal Oudinot, Due de
Reggio," compiled from the unpublished
papers of the Duchesse de Reggio; "Some
Masters of Lithography," by Atherton,
Curtis: "The Aurora Borealis," by Al
fred Angot; "The Beautiful Miss Brooke,"

namic Sociology," by Lester F. Ward; "S:ght,"
by Professor Joseph Le Conte; "History of
Bimetallism in the United Slates," by Profes
sor J. L. Laughlin, and "Actual Africa," by
Frank Vincent. Tne same firm will pub
lish shortly "Memoirs of Marshal Oudi
not, Due de Reggio," compiled from tha
hitherto unpublished souvenirs of the Duch
esse de Reggio. The marshal's wife was much
with her husband in tbe field, accompanying
him, for instance, during the retreat from
Moscow. Of that she gives a very graphic de
scription; and, Indeed, she draws vivid pic
ture! of all that stirring epoch. The book
takes in the revolution, the directory, Napo
leon's ascendency, the restoration, and cornea
up to about 1830. It has photographs of tha
marshal and his wife, who in the end of course
threw in their lot with the Bourbons.
The opening pages of the North American
Review lor March are devoted to a timely and
elaborate paper from the pen of Sir Edwin
Arnod on "The Famine in India." The prob
lem of "Prison Labor" is tnoughtfully con
sidered by Carroll D. Wright, United States
Commissioner of Labor, and in "The History
of a Poem" Edmund Gosse recounts the cir
cumstances connected with the production of
the late Coventry Patmore's work, "The Angel
in the House." "How to Reform Business
Corporations" is discussed by V. H. Lockwood,
and M. Georges Clexnenceau contributes the
second and concluding portion of his paper on.
â¢â¢The French Navy." A writer under the Big
nature of "A London Police Magistrate" gives
a description of "Drink and Drunkenness
in London," dwelling especially on the class
known as habitual drunkards. Under tne
captain of "The Railway Problem" are treated
two distinct and vital aspects of this great
question, the Hon. Lloyd Bryce considering
"The Legislative Solution" and James J. Wait
giving "A Mercantile View." The Hon. Edwin
Taylor appeals to the country at large "In De
fense of Kansas," and progressive religious
thought has its champion in Professor C. A.
Briggs, D.D., who furnishes a brilliant paper
on "Works of the Imagination in the Old Tes
tament." Other topics dealt with are: "When
Congress Should Convene," by the Hon. J. F.
Shatroth; -'The Question of Ships," by Win
tbrop L. Marvin; "Amenities of Philology,"
by Professor E. W. Bowen, and "Objections to
a Children's Curfew," by Winiired Buck.
Dr. Nansen's "Farthest North"' was pub
lished Id England ou Tuesday, February 16,
and on the same day the Messrs. Harper made
a formal publication of the book in this coun
try. To do this they had to make almost su>
perhuman efforts. The booK is In two vol
umes, octavo, and covers 1200 pages. Rough
proofs were received from London and
the matter was at once put Into type.
It took a tremendous force of printers
to accomplish tnis by tho desired
time. Then the revised proofs were sent over
from London, and the first American proofs
corrected by them. Though they worked as
printers have seldom worked before, it wa3
impossible to publtsh more than a sufficient
number of copies by the 15th to meet the re
quirements of the international copyright
law. The regular publication of the book
here will not bo until some time in March.
It will have 120 full-page and numerous
text illustrations, and sixteen colored
plates in fac-simile from Dr. Nansen's
own sketches, besides photogravure portraits
aud four maps. Notwithstanding the enor
mous price, $50,000, which they paid for it,
the English publishers of the book, Messrs.
Archibald Constable & Co., are said to have
more than insured their expenses with their
advance orders. "Farthest North" will be
bound in a greenish color, suggestive of the
tinge of the ice fields. On the cover of the
first volume will be a picture of the Fram,
etched in gold. An edition for the colonies
will be published in the Macmillan Colonial
Library.

F-*|RESSMAKERS tell us that it has
â a Ik ' jeen aa exceeding long time since
%mjji variety of costume and beauty of
maierial have been so charmingly com
bined as in the constructions of the dress
maker already planned for the Easter
days.
The truest of all things that can be said
about the Easter designs is that while they
are novel they are not strictly new. We
are often told that in dresses for women
there is never anything new under the
pun â that history merely repeats itself. I
Now oftentimes this is an atrocious slan
der. Our gowns are novel and new, and
in my heart I have always believed that
tue reason they were said not to be was be
cause of that innate jealousy of mau who
secretly fumes because his clothes are
never anything but worked-over styles.
This year, however, we must confess that
the novelties are few.
Eastep Costumes.
There is no intention to recall a single
word of praise said of the Easter costumes.
They are just as pretty as ttiey can be, and
the woman who could not find something
to please her among them is really too
particular for this world. It i 3 just a
feast to go and look at the fashion plates,
ana if you know some milliner, some
awell one, well enough to get in behind
the scenes, your breath will be fairly takeu
away by what is shown you. Probably
you wili'not have money enough to in
dulge in the beautiful creations yon see,
but then you know there is always the
/satisfaction ot realizing that the less ex
pensive gowns are nothing in the world
tut combinations of ideas gained from
other gowns whose cost has a terrific
effect on a bank account or a lonely purse.
Skirts are not going to be so full. Not
that there is going to be nn approach to
that abomination known as the "pull
back," but the voluminous has been re
tired and the gowns will not contain yards
of material that is of no more use than
â would be a bouquet fastened in the middle
of one's back. Sieaves, too, have really
diminished, and only a comparative full
ness is retained at the shoulder, a modifi
cation ot" that styie known as "Jeg o'
mutton." The skirts are more trimmed
than last season, and are generally quite
flat in tront. They have wide tabliers and
gored back breadths mounted in two or
three hollow plaits.
Belts and Bodices.
There are some of the creations of the
dressmaker which dispense with the belt.
The bodice comes over the skirt ana ends
in points back and front. This, however,
need not be taken as meaning that the
belt is vegetating. Not at all. Just so
long as the bolero exists belts will con
tinue to bold their own.
â  The belts, by the way, which are sup
posed to be of the sort which will become
popular are composed oftentimes of bands
of ribbon describing a downward point
and an upward point, the latter much
more defined than the former, three large
paste buttons adorning the middle, while
others are buckled at the sido. Another
belt is high in the back and narrow in
front, with a pa^te or a cut-steel buckle as
fastening. It is an unquestionable fact
that the trimmed skirt is making its way
into fashion. So far the skirt trimmings
of aay dresses are not too obtrusive, but
evening skirts are much more elaborate.
The blouse bodice in its many varieties
is still a prime favorite, and likely to re
main so all spring and summer. One
charming variety is made up of red
â¢woolen fabric, trimmed with black galon
twisted inio macaroons. The blouse bod
ice opens over a chemisette of gem-em
broidered white siik filied in with while
velvet, the collar being of the same. The
waist is confined by a belt fastened with a
buckle. The sleeves, adorned with braid
ings, are puffud at the top and frilled with
lace at tho wri3t.
Tl^e Princess Robe.
The princess robe, in all its simplicity
of line, seems again to be popular, or
rather achieving popularity. The style
of other days has been t-iightly modified
to suit tue requirements of the present.
An up-to-date robo is composed of red
cloth with strapped seams, the seams be
ing finished to correspond. Tho draped
apels in this particular robe are of white
satin veiled by cream-colored guipure, !
Then there is a lace cravat and a lace fin
ishing to the sleeves. This is one of the
! very swell robes, but of course the style is
maintained in equally striking but much
less expensive fashion. Braids, or galons,
as they are sometimes called, are to be
u*ed in conjunction with velvet, moire,
cloth and woolen materials.
Brocades.
The brocade petticoat is being worn a
little and is goin_- to be worn a good deal
I more. Take a real good brocade at a sale
price in a iloral design on a dark ground
and it is not at all a baa investment. How
j much superior such a one is to the white
| cambric only those who have had ex
perience of both and the laundress can
tell. It is not an extravagant plan to al
low yourself an undersfeirt of brocade also
in a pale color for evening wear. A very
â  mart little skirt was noticed the other
day which was made from three sale rem
nants â or rather four â when the ribbons
are included. The brocade itself was very
pretty with ita bunches of violets and
ratnoi bright green leaves scattered over
a darker green background, the lining of
the skirt being of shot glace 6ilk in har
monizing tones of violet and green. In
side the hem there were three Jittle
flounces of the glace silk while the skirt
was trimmed outside with a very deep
Five o'clock tea apron of turquoise blue taffeta, edged with white lace and a striped black and white ribbon.
White batiste nightrobe with sailor collar, ornamented with white lace insertion and edging. Thh collar opens upon a pleated plastron
and a flounce of white lace headed by insertion. Cuffs to match.
Sleeveless chemise of white batiste, hand embroidered and lace-edged. Pink or blue Inch-wide satin ribbons are run through worked
buttonholes near the top, frgut and back, and are tied iv bows on the shoulders.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
flounce of bright green silk pinked out
along the lower edge and veiled with fine
black Chantilly lace. This flounce was
headed by a box-plaited ruche of violet
ribbon with smart little bows in the two
colors at intervals all around.
Silks and Brocades.
These are to be had in wonderful varie
ties this season, owing to the fact that
there is a growing demand for tftese
fabrics, as in many cases silk has taken
the place of wool, and in numerous in
stances where wool has been used the ap
pearance of silk is carried out by an in
termixture of silk with the wool. As a
result ruany Jong-closed factories have
been opened, and from Italy are coming
some silks that will cause the merchants
in Lyons some uneasiness, so beautiful
are they In texture, coloring and design.
Bonnet has on the market at the present
time several most beautiful silks, firm as
a board and astonishingly reasonable in
price.
That we want variety is fully compre
hended by importers, and as a result a
bewildering number of patterns are pre- |
sented on our counters. For example, we j
may well be surprised at the novelties in
the waterings of the black and white silks
alone, as there are moire antique grounds
with large satin leaves, and over this
small cloudy effects. Charming is a white
moire watered to resemble water thrown !
on a highly polished surface, "where it is
apt to fcrm itself into deep points." Fre
quently in the case of new waterings there
are several aquatic designs in which
streams of satin appear to be bordered
with frost, as you may have seen the vege- !
tation with snow and hoar frost beside a
frozen stream.
Italian Satins,
The satins now being sent ont from
Italy I am really curious to see, for they
are said to be singularly oeantiful and
most diverse in color. The bouquets of
colored brocaded flowers, large and small,
on distinct grounds, are another great
element of beauty. They are, as it is
j technically called, emroidered after the j
weaving, and the back of the pattern dis- I
covers the various colors employed. There j

in a couple of shades, and there are many
j bold and beautiful Drocades in which
flowers of various kinds and different hues
would seem to have been painted on the
material.
It seems that at a very moderate price it
is quite possible to produce a greater ap- j
pearance of richness in brocade than in i
a:iy oiher make of silk, and c rtainly the
best qualities will long remain in vozue,
so marvelously lovely are they in patterns
and colorings, and they faithfully portray
nature, whenever flowers or vegetation
are the designs employed. As a result the
rarely exquisite greens in connection with
brighter hues seen on light grounds are
worthy subjects for an artist's brush, so
minutely do they reproduce the rarest and
most gorceous of blossoms.
in the cheaper silks are shown the dull
checked patterns our grandmothers used
to wear with so much complacency, but
tnrouirh the somber checks the weavers
have introduced a single bright tone with
excellent results.
Surah is to be again in demand as well
as Mascotte silks, they are between
merveilleux and surah. Foulards are
destined to be employed in the evolution
of numerous pretty, simple, cool little
frocks, and for waistcoats, vests, coats and
trimmings are to be hail an enormous
choice in closely woven geometrical pat
terns of many colorings intermixed. These
look much licher and more expensive than
they really are. There is a marked ten
dency to use surah, in many cases, instead
of taffeta. Our American silss daily gain
in popularity,, as in designs and quality
they are steadily improving.
Tfoe Latest Summer Fabrics
Which have reached vÂ«, so far, are many
of them possessed of rare beauty, among
them I am enthusiastic over the grena
dines, the grass linens and a new weave of
chiffon, one of which, a black one, is
woven with hroad black satin stripes and
then brocaded over in white skeleton fern
j leaves, and ghostly looking orchid and
iris blossoms. Others in gray, pink and
blue are equally artistic in effect.
Have you ail seen the beautiful displays
of grass linens and organdies in tue win
dows of some of our principal stores dur
ing the past week? That dainty linen
with the very open mesh of an ecru tone
j over a bright green silk taffeta is most
I fetching, as is also the one having a
twine-colored background, over which are
odd purplish figures. This one is to be made
over silks of the same line, with a great
sash and stock of wide ribbon to match.
Almost equally worthy of admiration is
another having a similar ground sprayed
with crimson roses. Crimson silk is to be
used as a lining. Such gowns will be
reveled in by young girls in the evening,
but their elders show a preference for
j dresses of figured or dotted black or white
! net, these all being made over brignt
, hued changeable taffeta.
Theri is noted a decided tendency to re
turn to dresses of black and white lace,
and the most extravagant orders have
been given for entire lace robes by several
of our country women who have recently
returned from abroad.
The plain organdies just uncaied at a
great New YorK house have in numerous
instances their skirts trimmed with inser
tions, which are graduated in length or
j with flounces in gradations, or grouped
Jon the bottom. The Spanish flounce will
I be worn, but it is to be varied in many
j ways.
Jin Jlmeriean Girl,
! With lovely fluffy blonde hair, was a pic
ture at an informal dance given about two
weeks ago. She was garbed in a pale blue
and white foulard, covered with an odd, ir
regular white figure. It was made over
taffeta, which exactly matched the blue
tone. Around the bottom of the skirt was
a email ruflle of light blue chiffon. This
! had two beading*; each as well as the
I lower hem, was ed^od with a narrow fine
and delicate lace. It is difficult to describe
the waist. Soft, full ruffles extend from
the low-cut neck to the waistband, all
being edged with the lace. Silken ribbons
complete it. Ribbons are much worn on
all dresses of either satin, silks or velvet.
Speaking of foulards, brown and tan, or
gray and black, go especially well together.
A gray and white one I recall that is es
pecially pretty also, of black and white
combination, that has tiny white ruffles
with black lace on them. The sleeves are
tight with three ruffles at the top.
Jleeordion Skirts
Are to bp popular, that is an accepted fact,
and in Europe an entirely new kind of

and exquisite little affairs will bold their
own lor many moons, for, according to
Vague, "tlie charm of the bolero has lost
none of its attraction, and promises to vie
with the popularity of the blouse, which
was an enduring favorite of years' stand
ing. The bolero is now so well under
stood â so well modeled to suit every
figure, and has been found so adaptable to
bodices of gowns, ranging from full dress
to negligees, and so capable of holding the
richest trimmings in voe;ue or treated with
extreme simplicity â that it is not to be
expected that so admirable a dress featare
is to be abandoned. Empiecements â
those varied and pretty bodice conceils
designed to ornament them in odd way?,
introducing tine bits of lace, needlework
embroidery or rich stuffs in contrastâ will
hold their own we feel sure, as they are
too serviceable in producing a variety of j
models.
"Our summer gowns, we may feel as
suied, are to hay* their bodices trimmed
with flat or ruffled boleros, as well as lace
ones; and puttings have their share of
ornamentation, while plisse will con
tribute their pre-eminent grace and be
comingness."
There is nothing more novel than the
moussehnes de soie painted in pale colors
in imitation of old brocades. Dresses made i
out of these gauzy stuffs are trimmed
with flounces cat bias, alternated with
lace. The bodices are adorned in the
same wny and finished at the waist with
wide pleated bands of a bright color in a
miroir velvet of a strongly contrasting
shr.de, with three rhineslone buckles upon
one Â«ide.
Silk slips are used for all these dresses,
and naturally such toilettes necessitate
the wearing ot the loveliest of underskirts.
Tfye Wfoite Petticoat,
Which has been discarded, in a great
measure, for several years, is to be once
more indispensable, and -some owned by
a New York belle, who has just returned
from abroad, are very exquisite, being
masses of laces and delicate incruated em
broideries. Greatly will the laundries re
joice at the news, but for those of mod
erate means this decree of fashion will
not be received with rejoicing, so ex
pensive are to be skirts and so enormous
will be the laundry bills. However, the
fiat has gone forth and girls who are fond
of tine needlework will, during these
Lenten days, make many a dainty gar- |
ment, in the evolution of which can be i
used the fine pieces of embroideries and j
laces accumulated by the careful shopper
during the recent sales.
Such work is very satisfactory when
one has an abundance of leisure, other

cheap varieties, but well-made and neatly
Handled articles.
How seldom nowadays do we hear of a
bride making for her trousseau the thou
sand and one garments which a century
ago she busied herself with. I have heard
grandmothers regret the change, but I
cannot say I do, lor what does the aver
age bride want with two or three dozen of
each article of underwear? The fashions
change in everything, and the slender
maiden frequently becomes a plump
matron, who has no use for the great
chests of underlinen. Even table-linen
changes so in style that no large amount
should be purchased at one time. Several
of our pretty girls are so soon to become
brides that I am repeating my advice to
them, by which some ol my readers may

the only harmless method that can be
employed is the free use of castile soap

but will darken the hair. I feel positively
sorry for the women who insist on using
chemicals on themselves to alter naturc'3

Styles for Men.
Many of the new plaids and checks just
received in New York are being much ob
jected to by conservative men, as they are
both loud and horsey looking. These will
not be fashionable E ist, neither will they
receive the stanm of approval of our bent
dressed men, cb Him says:
"In order to avoid conspicuous clothing
you will have to study the patterns in the
latter i 3 rather effeminate, I think, and
not in keeping with the chromatic mascu
line mode."
The bsst fabrics to be ordered made up
for your shirts are cheviot or madras, the
very ordinary percales are all going out of
style. Avoid vividly hued shirts as care
fully as the too pronounced tweeds, but it
i 3 predicted that tartan ties and imperials
are to be very popular all spring; also hat
bands to match tne ties.
For overcoats the most popular fabrics
are coverts and kerseys, and light taa
shade* are preferred. Undressed worst
eds, vicunas, Venetians and cheviots are
being made up into long coats.
It is thought that the wearing of knick
erbockers will eventually revolutionize
men's fashions, and one authority de
clares '-I advocate knee breeches for full
dress, formal dress, every kind of dress
except nightdress." C. C.

718 MARKET STRBBT.He Sought Fortune in the Copra Groves
/\ Galiforr\iar\'s Pare Experience in tke South Sea Islands ar\d
Why JHis Venture Failed
WHITTLE is thought, as we daily gather I
"Isij around the "festive board" to par
***/ take of the delicacies of the menu,
how they are obtained or how great a dis
tance they come from. In illustration of
this statement the experieuce of F. M.
Kendall, a Californian, in respect to one
articJe of delicacy will be interesting.
Having learned How much profit couid be
acquireu in tue cultivation of "copra," or
cocoanut, the greater part of which is
raised in the northern part of the island
of New Guinea, Mr. Kendall sought the
advice of prominent officials of the Ger
man Government, and encouraged by
their representations concluded to enter
into the pursuit. He accepted as a part
ner one who was an active member of the
agency, on the island.
Mrs. Kendall accompanied her husband
on his expedition, and was the first Ameri
can woman to place her foot upon the soil
of this portion of New Guinea.
How the South Sea Islands first became
inhabited by Kanakas is a mooted ques
tion. It is thought by Borne that refugees
from the Malay peninsula and adjacent
islands crossed over in canoea and by
lapse of time their original traits of char
acter became obliterated and gradually
became those of the present inhabitants.
Another theory ur^ed with more perti
nancy is that a banishment from Mexico
drove a strange people to seek an asylum
in those vast wilds. This theory is par
tially sustained by the discoveries in
Mexico of war implements and coverings
for their person similar to those now used
by the Kanakas.
Although much effort has been made to
civilize these peoples, but little success
comparatively has been aitained, as each j
island embraces a separate tribe, distinct i
in itseif and hostile to the others.
Nature seems to have particularly fa- j
vored the island of New Guinea for the j
raising of cotton and copra, but the Ger- I

man Government is not liberal In extend- i
ing inducement to the world to come and
assist in improving the vast territory by
the sa!e and occupancy of land.
Kendall wa3 exremely disappointed
and utterly astonished when the Govern
ment officials refused to sell or lease a
foot of available land to him, and to only
allow him to purchase the wild land as he
went into the interior. But his only exit
from the country was by means of a Ger- j
man steamer which p'.ied between Her
bertshoh and Singapore once in every
two months. He was ob'.igjd to accept
the {â ituation. and lived in one of the
Government houses until he was deposed,
be'ore the arrival ot the steamer.
He and his wife and the others of the
expedition would have been in exceed
ingly sad piigrit but lor the courtesy of a
Ruraan Catholic Uisliop, who presided
over a mission established there before the
German regime. The men of the party
were taken into the b:o;l.er's house an 1
the others into a nunnery, and the voy
agers were entertained by the Catholics
nntil the time of their tlepanure arrived.
The personal effects of Mr. Kendall and
bis associates were disposed of at a great
sacrifice.
t The first endeaver to opon up this island
Iwas made at Frederick Williams Haven.
â Here was cleared 3750 acres of land, and
riDout one-third of tins aiea had been
planted when, tho effect of opening up
such an extent of the germ-tilied earth at
once, the yellow fever broke oat, causing
the death of many hundreds o' the na
tives and a number of Americans.
Opposite from Frederick Wiiiams Ha
ven, the Government seat, is situated the
heralet oi Herbertsuoh, the place where
Kendall and his associates were landed.
There is a beautiful bay between the two
places extending several miles, and open
at either end to seafaring vessels, forming
a fine land-locked harbor. Here was made
a more successful attempt to cultivate the
copra, and 2TjOO or more acres of laud was
iru proved.
But immediately back from the unim
proved land the Kanaka lives in all his
native fierceness and savanoness. Within
a mile and a half of Herbertshoh two
natives, a man and a boy, were killed,
roasted and eaten by the Kanakas. The
parties who did the eating were afterward
arrested by the German agency and were
tried for the offense and convicted ana
hanged. In such a neighborhood Kendall
and his party were offered land to carry
out their undertaking. The case cited is
not isolated. The naiivo has r.ot the
semblance of fear of consequences when
onco his wild nature becomes aroused.
still exists on the island
vciih only a very thin veneer of assumed
civilization to cover its ghastly form.
The method the agency uses in procur
ing native laborers, Mr. Kendall says, is
unique. A small schooner is employed
with a complement ol officers and crew
and is supplied with articles of trade cal
culated to tempt the cupidity of the
native. The vessel cruises amone the
Ulauds and the trader* and crew are
landed in small boats at various points to
meet the natives as they line the shore.
The captain of the schooner and others
endeavor to persuade the natives to go
aboard the7essei and often success crowns
their efforts; at othei times more strenu
ous measures, Mr. Kendall says, arc em
ployed. Few natives from New Guinea
are selected i'or tins work since their
escape to the interior is easy, while those
from other islands have extremely limited
opportunity to get away.
"There is a semblaee of a contract for
three years made between these poor
slaves, as they are in fact," said Mr. Ken
dall, "and the agency, whereby the natives
are to be housed and fed taro and rice
and for their weekly services receive the
munificent stipend of two sticks of infe
rior tobacco, one-quarter of an inch square
and six inches long, twenty-six to
the pound. at a cost of 32 cents;
also one clay pipe (all the natives
use tobacco, both male and female).
"Every month a lavalava is added to
their wages. This consists of two fancy
cotton bandana handKerchiefs, used about
the loins as their only article of covering
by the men, and in many instances used
by the women in the *anie capacity. After
the expiration of this contract the native
laborers are furnished with a trading box,
consisting of such articles as best suit
their idea for disposal among their fellow
creatures. But, though they, in their
ignorance, consider this a gift, in reality
it has been paid for by their labor many
times over.
"The manner of preparing the grou nd
for the planting of copra is very simple,"
said Mr. Kendall. "The natives grub
with a large hoe the trees, which are com
paratively few, and none are larjje. Vast
tracts of land are covered only by gniss cr
berry bushes arising from the burned
district, which these nomadic tribes h&\Â£
sat on fire in their wanderings over the
plains in search of food.
"The soil is principally sandy, richly in
termingled with vegetable mold, which
renders its productiveness exceedingly
active. When all is in readiness for the
planting rows are made ten feet apart and
either young sprouted cocoannt plants,
obtained by the natives in the interior or
those without any advancement, procured
from wild trees near at hand, are placed
in the rows.
"These plants mature in three or four
years and coruiuue twenty or thirty years
A RATTLE SNAKE RANCH
IN ARIZONA
Â§)jS the Bill Williams fork of the
â Z Colorado River, in the western part
R of Arizona, near tlic junction of the
Rio San Marie in Mohave County, within
a stone's throw of Yavapai and Yuma
counties, perhaps fifty miles southeast
from the Needles and fifteen due east from
Planet Town, is the rattlesnake ranch of
Mark Dorney. A more particular location
of the place â lacking tiresome citations of
ran<*e, township and sectionâ could
scarcely be given, for this is yet a wild and
unpeopled district of the Treasure Terri
tory, and guideposls and landmarks are
neither plentiful nor certain. But any
one who hails from that part of the Terri
tory will tell you all about it, because if
they haven't seen it they have heard of it.
Of ail the ranches on earth perhaps
Mark Dorney's is the strangest and the
most fearsome. There is always a well
tilled keg of rye or bourbon in the cabin
and usually the door to the cabin is wide
open. A collateral circumstance is that
the whisky is safe under all conditions.
When Dorney noes to Planet Town he
leaves the bouse wide open â to let it air

in bearing. Between these trees cotton is
planted similarly in style to that em
ployed by American farmers in their
culture of peas. In ten or twelve days
after planting appears the green blade,
and in six months the first crop is gath
ered, which, it ordinarily productive, is
sufficient to remunerate the expense of
preparing the land and considerably
toward the payment of it, if it could be
purchasea. This cotton production con
tinues, to greater or less succe.-s, every
six months for live years without replant
ing and only an occasional weeding, 100
pounds to the 2>Â£ acres Deing an ordinary
yield.
"In planting the copra, nuts fairly
ripened and those fully matured are
selected. Once at the stockhouse an outer,
fibrous covering is removed, the shell
broken. The â¢verbenas,' or female labor
ers, secure the white meat, cutting it into
small pieces, preparaiory to putting it
upon racks to be dried by solar or artificial
heat, the time depending mainly upon the
maturity of the nut. The immature nuts
are soft, but their contents can be readily
eaten with a spoon.
"It tanes about 7000 nuts to produce a
ton of dried copra, and a tree will yield
about 100 sound nuts yearly. The price
varies, but the average result is $40 per
ton. With some slight exceptions, the
greater part of this production is shipped
from this inland to Germany, where it is
placed in its commercial form, known as
'desiccated cocoanut,' 'confectioner's
stock,' and by other names."

only one man ever steps knowingly, and
that man is the proprietor of the rattle

This reign is regarded as the most bril

The Spaniards boast justly of the reigns
of some of their sovereigns. James lof

to 1276, while Pedro IV and John II ruled
respectively fifty-one and fifty-four years.
From the time iripain was consolidated, in

four and forty-six years.
The reigns of several of the Prussian
kings have been very long. Frederick

"Kiil the sarpint as soon as he stints," !
says Dorney. ''Cut him up in small pioces I

it absorbs the poison. When it is good

Dorney has made a good deal uf money
Out of his surprising occupation in the
last three years. He is "proving up" on a j
quarter section, and every acre of his land
has its score or more of rattlers' nests.
He makes the conditions agreeable for
them. He harvests the old ones, and the
others breed fast enough. In the begin
ning he found his c!aim overrun with
rattlers. Thai's what put the idea of
breeding them into his head.
Dead rattlesnakes are worth money, if
one knows how to dispose of them and
has a liking for the business. The bar-
Vest is a profitable one. To begin with, a
good percentage of the rattles will sell to
the curio stores at Santa Barbara, San
Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
They bring as high as 50 cents a dozen
wholesale, and perhaps a couple of hun
dred dozen can be sold in a year. Bat

"^â Sv a * been stirre( * to a turbulent pud*
u*r* die by the news of the dance to be
given by Mrs. Dutch Pete of Greenhorn (
Gulch next Friday night in the scnool-
I house, on which occasion Mrs. Pete has
promised to knock all the spots off the
dance given last month by Mrs. Turkey
Joe of Cricket Flat.
The sums spent for cheesecloth and
prize-box jewels will amount to some
thing, while the grub will be hot stuff.
Mrs. Pete has been cookine the old hen a
few days already, and she admitted to
your reporter (exclusive) that she intended
to make sandwiches of said ancient fowl
and pieces of soda biscuit.
At the memorable function of Mrs. Joe
the guests were regaied with fried perk
between cold pancakes, and then the storm
of denunciation that arose from the poor
and the preacher* almoit drowned ihe
fiddle.
While partakintr of the sumptuous sup
per on Cricket Flat, the braast of Mrs.
Pete swelled with envy so that her next
to-her-Sunday Dafque burst down the
back, causing some invidious remarks
about red flannel and black shoestring.
At that moment Mrs. Pete resolved to
show them Cricket Flatters they are by
DO means the only shirts in the laundry,
and to that end she has been doins; extra
churning ever since and laying by a part
of her princely income to make a spread
at her own dance.
It is understood that persons appearing
in the same rips worn at Mrs. Turkey Joe's
dance will be politely but firmly requested
to chase themselves out of that, and
Cricket Flatters are turning and dyeing
and lixing up. They realize that not any
old tiling will do for an occasion of the
sort. Red and green ribbons have ad
vanced in price, and Bhiemoss of Humbug
has been employed to design one new
creation and take a aettin' of turkey eggs.
Mrs. Dutch Pete herself will appear as
in the picture given (pxclnsive) in timo
thy green muslin de caiico, built high
above the waist and cut short below. Her
hair will be dressed in Irish feathers,
placed with unstudied careles.sne.ss, and
her diamond breastplate cost exactly 5
cents at. Mm. Heybrooke's notion-store.
Mrs. Pete intends to be head couple in the
famous basket quadrille with young
Pitchpine Jenkins, and to make sure of
him he nas been given a pound of butter
and four pints of sour milk. The way
tliey will sashay, do-see-do and balance to

future's history.

grease enters into the composition of
some very high-priced cosmetics, and
when converted into oil has medicinal
properties that render it very valuable to
druggists. Cattle rangers in the neighbor
hood Jcok with some envy upon the
profits of Mark Dorney's outlandish busi
ness, and there have been rumors of rival
rattlesnake ranches, but as yet no one has
appeared who comoines the competency
and the pluck necessary to engage in the
hazardous enterprise. Men who do busi
ness in Arizona aie not, as a rule, fas
ti Jious in the matter of avoidine rattlers.
Yet no man seeks lheir company, and the
idea of living forever in the midst of them
is disconraeing to the average cow
puncher, and not sufficiently enticing,
even considering possible profits, to in
duce any precipitate rush of the very
wildest and most dare-devil rangers into
that vocation.
"I drifted into it because I had to," ex
plains Dorney. "I started out by trying
to kill off all the rattlers on my Diace, but
I found there were so many of them that
I save up the job in disgust. I bad killed
four or five hundred when somebody told
me I could sell the oil and the hides. I
didn't believe it at first, but when I found'
it was a sure go on that line I just turned

"she don't mind no expense so long as
she can put out Mrs. J^e's eye."
Your reporter has with much difficulty
succeeded in petting descriptions of a few ]
of the most expensive and notable get-ups.
Mrs. Ernestina Bhnlcy, the world
famed heiress of a rockpile, will wear a
new dress of pink cheesecloth and pillow-
case lace. The waist will bo made with
needle and thread, and the skirt wi'l dip

her new gree;i glass breastpin. Mrs.
B inky will wear a switch, and have her
weather-eye open for a beau.
Young Miss Manzanita Jim will be

tint as 1 could for the reptiles. I have a
pretty nice harvest every year now.
"How do I kill' em? Just hit them with
a thin stick. A rattler is the easiest sort
of thing to kill, you know. Only don't
hit down at a rattler; he'll be apt to get
you if you do. ' Hit sideways. You can
hit quicker that way, and besides,' it cuts
off his movements better and more
surely."
Dorney doesn't have any regular harvest
time. He just goes around killing off the
big snakes as fast as he wants to work.
When he has slaughtered four or five !
dozen he gets to work skinning them, and
then he tries out the fat in a big kettle
that rests on an adobe oven in front of 'his
cabin. Dorney's cabin is not entirely like
the other cabins in that part of the world.
It rests on stilts ana is ten/ feet above
the ground. This altitude !is not for sani
tary reasons entirely, , but to insure soli
tude at night in the midst of unpleasant i
company. There is a rude ladder reach
ing from the ground to the door.
"I had steps at first," says Dorney, "but â 
I found some of the. big 'fellers' could
climb them." ~:
Now he sleeps soundly at night with' i
only that keg of -firewater for company, !
and the fact that there may be a neat I

Quair\t English Gustoms.
There is scarcely a manor in England
where some queer old custom dating bacJC
to feudal times does not survive, recalling
the former prestige and glory of tn c
"lords of the manor." Thus at Brough
ton, on each Pa'ni Sunday since time
immemorial, the so-called "gad whip' 1
memorial service takes place. The
lord of the manor, leaving his pew
in tho chancel, advances to fhe steps
thereof and crncks a heavy carnage
whip three times, while the rector is
reading the first lesson. At the beginning
of the second lesson he approaches the
parson with his whip in his hand and a
purse with gold pieces tied to the other
end of the lash. This he waves thrice in
the air and then holds the whip so that
the purse hangs directly over tho priest's
head until the cone usion of the chapter,
when the priest takes possession of the
imrse and reverently places it on the altar.
Volumes might bt written about these
aueer manorial customs, the origin of
most of them being lost in antiquity.
A Bishop's Story.
A good story is i oing the rounds on
Bishop Paret of Baltimore. Some time
ago he was the guest of an Episcopal
family in West Virginia. Learn
ing from the Bishop that he
liked hard- boiled eges for breakfast,
his hostess went to the kitchen to
boil them herself. While so engaged
she began to sing the first stanza of a
hymn. Then she sang the second stanza,
the Bishop, who was in the dining-room,
joining in. When it was finished there
was silence, and the Bishop remarked,
"Why not sing the third verse?" "The
third verse?" replied the lady, as she came
into the dining-room carrying the steam
ma eggs. "Ob, that's not necessary." "I
don't undeisrand," replied Bishop I'aret.
"Oh, you see," she said, "when I am
cooking esrgs I always sing one verse
for soft boiled and two for hard boiled."
Glowworms are much more brilliant
when a storm is coming on than at other
seasons. Like many otner mysteries of
nature this curious circumstance has
never oeen explained.

A thought for the comiDg week:
"That the tongue is not steel,
Yet it cuts!"
March! yon blustering, noisy lout!
What are yon d> ing V Where do you stay ?
Winter is flying in broken array;
Come! bid her whirl to the right-about-
Get the fields ready for April and May.
Thaw the ice from the frozen rill.
Blow the clouds to their proper places,
Gather the strong winds loud and shrill
To dry the marsh and to clear the hill,
For spring to display her airs and graces!
Awkward you are, and sharp, no doubt;
Still are we glad to see you near,
With cheek so ruddy and eye so clear,
With lusty humor and joyous shout,
Calling iar ofi ior the summer to hear.
Rough as your clumsy touch may be,
It fringes the tassel for alder and larch;
Your jolly, gruff laughter rings merry and
arch;
You are the sort of a fellow for meâ
Come from your hiding-place. Forward,
March! M. E. Blake.
'Tis March! March witb his dark days
of farewell to winter and bis bright blue

If those who were blown to this world
of ours by bieak March winds ever wear
upon their fingers a bloodstone they will
be given great wisdom, and in time of
danger be always firm and brave.
An odd stone it is, too; hard and finely
tibrous, being really a kind of iron ore. It
varies in its color from a steely gray to a
bright blood red.
It was very highly prized by the an
cients, many of the Egyptian intaglios be
ing made of it, but now it is principally
used as a polish for other stones and
metals.
"What is commonly called the blood

Spring.
I come, I coma with my cheering smile
Each waiting flower to greet;
O'er hill and dale,
In wild wood vale,
Are the marks of my dancing feet.
My steps are light as a feather blown
Wherever the wind may list;'
But the flowers wild
Have blushed and smiled,
Wherever my lips have kissed.
The hills are clothed with a vivid green
Of softest moss and grass;
A graceful bed
For the lovely head
Of each little wildwood lass.
I bring for these, my children dear,
The gift, of a sunny smile,
And a soft caress,
And a dainty dross
Colored ia glowing style.
To them I am a Santa Claus
Who comes but once a year,
But I linger long
With a smile and song;
I sm loth to disappear.

True Story of
Billy Young,
JHE DRUJ^ER BOY.
BY STELLA M. IDDINUS.
(As Related to Her by Her Father.)
IriN July, 1862, Captain Owens opened a
jj recruiting office in Detroit for the
_!Â£ Twenty-fourth Michigan Infantry, and
to attract attention he Dad little Billy
Young (who did not look to be over 8
years old) drumming for him in front of
his office. No one thought of so small a
boy going to the war; but Billy was full
o f fight and wanted to do his share in put
ting down the rebellion.
His mother would not consent to his gc
ine with the regiment and it nearly broke
the little fellow's heart. So it was a sad
day for him when the Twenty-fourth left
A GAME WITH MAMMA'S BOA.
March bloWs aWavj the storms of Winter
To make earth and skvj ready for the joys of spring.
j Billy for a "home guard" and went to the
"front" without him. Yet he kept on
beating his drum in public, but kept his
thoughts to himself.
One day not lone after the Twenty
fourth departed he saw troops going on
board a boat bound for Washington. He
joined the troops and asking no questions
he walked on board unmolested. The i
Twenty-fourth was in camp at Washing- j
ton, and what was their surprise to see j
one day coming up the road but a
drum with a little head just peeping over |
it, and lo! and behold Billy soon arrived,
happy and hungry. The captain wrote
his mother concerning his whereabouts j
and she could do no more than give her j
j consent for him to remain. So Billy en- ]
j listed as a drummer.
The regiment soon went into active ser
â  vice and the little drummer was allowed
j to "run wild" or any way he liked. Some- '
where in Maryland he picked up a little
darky boy about his own age named
I Lincoln. They chummed, and when Billy j
was tired Lincoln carried the drum. They
ate, slept and were always togetherâ very
. much alike except in color.
Billy's clothes soon wore out, so he had
to tafee a pair of men's pants and cut off
the legs. Then he pulled the waistband
clear up to his armpits and did not care
how long the war lasted. Nevertheless he
| had lots of "good stuff" in him, only it
i needed to be brought out. After about
j six months his captain had a tine new
j military suit of clothes made on purpose
i for Bitly by a tailor in the company. The
I little boy next had his hair cut and went
\to the creek and took a good bath. Put
! ting on the new suit he took a look at bim
: self; first at his pants, then at his coat.
' Finally straightening himself up be said:
! "Now, Billy, yon have got to be a man.
| You can't chum with the darky any
! more." An for the rest of the time he was
| a perfect little gentleman and did the
j drumming both for the brass band and for
j the drum corp*.
Sometimes on dress parade the running
blackberry vines would catch his feet and
i over on his drum he would go, just as any
boy might fall over a barrel, but up he
would jump, run and get his place and
drum away as if it was all in the play.
i Even the colonel had often to smile, and
some of the band boys couldn't blow for
: laughing.
Billy was a temperance boy, too. Yes, he
i promised his mother he wouldn't drink
i and he kept that promise faithfully. Often
â  when the band went to serenade some
generals he felt insulted v.'hen the bottle
was passed to him. Once as his regiment
was failing back (won't call it retreating)
from Stevensburg, Va., the shells were
| falling pretty thick, and Billy, if he was
j small, was making "good time."
As they passed a house where several
' ladies stood looking out, one of them said :
' "Oh! see that little drummer-boy." An
other said: "Where? O, yes! The dear,
| little fellow."
Billy shouted: "If you feel so bad as
that, why don't yon bring out a hoe-cake?
; But then, don't know as I could stop to
i eat it. I'm very anxious to get across the
river just now."
On the march for Gettysburg he got
very tired, so when he passed near the
quartermaster's wagon, as he knew a good
thing when he saw it, he stopped with
him. Here let me say he was always wel
come anywhere around headquarters. He
would co out to buy butter and eggs of
the farmers, and when he offered the
i money to pay they invariably refused it.
He said it didn't make him mad a bit
when they refused the money. In that
way be kept the quartermaster's table
well supplied. After the battle of Gettys
| burg come one said: "Billy, where were
j you at the time of tho fight?" Straight
ening up his little form he answered:
"Twenty-six miles in the* rear, living on
the fat of the land." There was another
William Young in the regiment Once
when Colonel Morrow was at home on a
furlough Billy's mother asked Die colonel
wh<Â»t kind of a soldier her son made.
Thinking of the other William Young,
he answered, "A good soldier â always in
the thickest of the fight." The mother
was frightened, and cried: "What! my
little boy in the thickest of the fight?"
The colonel saw his mistake and said,
"Ob, you mean little Billy. He is a good
boy and a fine drummer."
While the regiment was in front of Pe
tersburg Billy got a fifteen-day furlough
to go home and see his mother. He got
back as far as City Point, Va., on time,
but being quite sick he called on a Mrs.
Dr. Ripley â a lady in charge of the low
dist Kitchen whose brother was one of the
Twenty-fourth boys and on duty thereâ
and. as Billy had met Mrs. R. several
tirces before, hÂ« was as much at home in
her tent as though it was his mother's.
The comrade notified the colonel in the
I morning of his reÂ»,urn, about fcis sickness,
and Billy was allowed to stay at the hos
pital until he was better. It took a long
I time for him to recover, for ha had so
much fun boating on Appomattox Bay and
taking in the sights at the landing that he
didn't care to be better. Billy was a fine
scroll writer. One day Mrs. Ripley saw
that he was very busy with a pencil and a
pine board. After he had gone out she

read thus:
Sacred to the memory of

Who departed this life gallantly fighting
for his country.
Peace to his ashes.
But everything has to end at some time.
One day Billy came in looking a little
sober." Sfid he: "Here is an imperative
order for me to report to my regiment."
â But Billy," said the comrade, "do you
think you are strong enough to go yet?"
"I'm afraid I'm not quite; the bay looks
so tempting, 1 think I'll chance it a lew
days more," was his reply.
Well, he finally went back and the
colonel was so pleased to see him that he
asked no questions about his sickness.
He served the full term (three years) and
went home to Detroit quite a grown-up
boy. He proved to be sober and indus
trious. After a while ho learned the en
graver's trade, married a pretty girl and
becrme in time the head of a family.
So, according to the old adage I will say
in conclusion: "All's well that ends

U WAS YOU EVER A NAUGHTY GIRL, FAN-FAN?"
Robbie's Story.
"Tell me a story, niimms, please,"
urged little five-year-old Robbie; as his
mother came into the sitting-room where
he was playing with his Noah's Ark. "I'm
just t:oing to put Noah ami his wife to
bed, and the animals are shut up for the
night. Won't you tell me a story?"
"There isn't much time before papa
comes home, dear; only about Qfteen
minutes. He is coming early to-night."
"Never mind, mamma; you can tell me
a nice little story in fifteen minutes if you
begin right away," ana Robbie drew his
little chair close beside his mother's and
waited for her to begin.
"Once upon a time," she began, "a good
while ago, there was a little boy named
Otto."
"How lone ago, mamma? Was it
evsr'n ever so many days, or was it a
year?"
"It was more than a year, Robbie."
"How long time is a year, mamma?"
"A year is twelve months."
"But how many days, I mean?"
"Three hundred and sixty-five," an
swerrd Robbie's mamma.
"Oh, what lots of daysl" said Robbie,
looking very thoughtful. "Was Otto a
very little boy, mamma, littler than me?"
"Don't say 'littler than me,' dear," said
Robbie's mamma, "for that isn't a nice
way to talk. Say smaller than I."
"Why can't I say littler as well as
smaller, mamma? I think it sounds just
as nice."
"I can't explain that to you now, Rob
bie, but if you don't care 10 hear about
the little boy, I'll go and see about papa's
supper," said Robbie's mamma, half-rising
from her seat.
"Oh, I do, I do, mamma!" cried Robbie,
twisting his little chair about and seizing
his mother by the neck. "Please tell me
what the little boy did."
"The little boy went out to play in the
garden," began Robbie's mamma again,
but Robbie interrupted:
"Was it a great big garden, mamma, or
was it just a little one, like ours?"
"It was a pretty large garden," Rob
bie's mamma answered, patiently, "and
little Otto staried out to play there â "
"Did it have flowers and trees, and
pretiy, furry caterpillars, and dear little
bop-toads, mamma?"
"Yen. it had all those, just like our gar
den; nnd Otto "
"O mamma, I think I must tell you
somefin' before I forget it again. You i
know the soiled place on my blouse you
asked me 'boutl"
"Yes. You said you didn't know how
it came there," answered Robb c's mamma,
soberly.
"Well, mamma, I did 'orget, but now I
'member all 'bout it. There was a dear
little hop-toad lying rig it down in the
garden patch, watchm' to catch a fly for
His breakfus.' I didn't want to 'sturb him,
so I nad to lie right flat on my stomach to
kiss him, he looked so cunning!"
"Bnt you shouldn't have kissed him,
Robbie. You know I've told you a great
many times not to kiss anything or any
body but papa and mr.mmnand uncle and
auntie. Can't you remember, Robbie V"
"I thin* I'll 'member now, mamma,"
said Robbie quickly, evidently anx-ous to
change the .-Ã¼bject. "Tell me, mamma,
what did the little boy do when he went
out in the garden?"
"When the little boy went out into the
garden to play," continued Robbie's
mammn, "he did not notice v black cloud
that was just coming up in ibe West."
"What made the cloud black, mamma?
Did the angels up in the sky paint it
black?"
"No, dear; clouds are black when they
are lull of rain or wind."
"I don't like black clouds, mamma, and
I don't believe the little boy liked them
either. I like white clouds and pink and
red clouds. Mamma, are there any green
cloud*?"
"No, Robbieâ"
"Why?"
"Now, Robbie, you must not nsk so
many questions, or I shall never finish my
story," said Robbie's mamma a little im
patiently. "Otto, as I said, went out in
the garden, and he carried with him a lit
tle shovel and pail â "
"O, mamma," cried Robbie, jumping
out of his. cliair, "was he going to dig
clams ? Don't you 'member what a lovely
time I had on the beach with my little
shovel and pail when the man snowed me
how to dig clams out of the mud, and they
siuck out their little biuck heads and spit
at me."
"Yes, I remember," said Robbie's
mamma, pressing her little boy oack into
his chair. "Do sit down, Robbie. Otto, you
know, was in a garden, not on the beacli.
Clams don't live in flower sardens."
"Why don't they live in flower gardens,
mamma? What do nice little clams live
in the mud for?"
I Robbie wriggled himself hail-way across
his mamma's lap, and looked eageriy up
into her face. Robbie's mamma began to
look tired, ami paying no at'.ention to his
last question she went on with her story.
"Otto, as I tola you, did not notice the
bLck cloud, and he was walking into the
gnipe-arbor swinging his little pail, when
suddenly he beard a loud rumble and a
crnsh which he knew was thunder â "
"Oh, mamma! Wasn't he awfully fright
ened? I don't like thunder."
Robbie's mamma glanced at the clock.
1 But what makes the lightning? Mam
ma, teil me what makesâ"
Robbie's mamma held up hÂ»r hand,
while a look of great relief came over her
1 face.
"Hark! I think that is papa's step in
the hall. Yes, it is. Come, let us run
and meet him."
"But, mamma, I want to hear the rest
of the story about the little boy In the
garden," cried Robbie, as his mamma
hastened into the hall. â Youth's Com

had one of the swiftest rides on the "skees"
tnat 1 ever had. The snowshoes are made of
wood. In the middle it is the thickest, where
the straps for the feet go in. The snowshoes
are tapering and the tip is bent or curved. To
make snowshoes it is necessary to get the

âHarper's Round TÂ»MÂ«.A Battle Underneath the Ocean's Waves
May Be a Feature of the Next Qreat Warâ Jules Verne's Dreams
May Be Pealized
I|T SEEMS a fact beyond question that
a marked feature of the next great
_ii war will be submarine conflicts. Ex
periments have just been made with tir
ing solid shot and projectiles under water
with marked success.
Not only will wave-hidden mines ana
marine torpedoes act as destructive ele
ments, but it has jun been discovered
that guns can be successfully fired under
water, and an effective submarine battery
will be a part of the armament of every
coast fortification.
It is bad enough to take chances of
being blown into the air in fragments, ship
ACTUAL TEST DEMONSTRATES THAT SOLID SHOT CAN BE FIRED U.NDcR WATER. .
a I all, by the explosion of a dynamite \
mine hidden under the water, or to have
a jagged hole made in the vitals of the sh ip
beneath the water line, but there is some
thing distinctively terriole in the thought
that along the shore, no one can tel:
where, there is hidden a submarine bat
tery which can s-end solid shot, and ex
j lo?ive shells through the water and all
c bs:ruct:on* until they reach the hull of
the doomed ship.
Tell the ordinary sailor or marine there
is danger ahead and he will cheerfully
fjce it. That is his business and what he
is there for. He expects iÂ». But like the
child w o is afraid of the nameless and
unknown terrors of the dark, both Jack
and the Jolly have a holy and reasonably
pardonable horror of the unknown.
In a state of war everybody is prepared
for such things as a sudden journey into
the air and a descent in fragments, or a
dull explosion followed by a ripping of the
, and the graduated sinking of the
i 4c battle-ship. There is nothing like
this, however, in connection with the dis
charge of a submerged battery.
There is no report, no smoke and no in
timation, save a slight ripple of the water,
that anything unusual has occurred, unti:
suddenly the vast hull shivery, trembles
a* if a ledge had been struck and then
wit ha roll and a plunge goes downward
to the bottom.
Unlike the torpedo which can in a meas
ure be guarded aguinst and the mine
which Can be located and exploded in a
variety of ways there are no known means
of guarding against a military attack
when made below the surface. For the
experiments which demonstrated the en
tire feasibility of the firing of guns be
neath the surface of the water a 110
--j>ound gun was used. The experiments
i recently made in Portsmouth harbor were
I unique, in detail.
i At low water tb.3 sun and its carriage
V.vaa lowered beneath the surface and a
diver sent down to place it in position on
a solid plank platform laid on the bot
tom. Tho platform was weighted with
lar(;e blocks of granite to keep it steady
and the gun and carriage was then placed
in position.
Fur the first test a target composed of
oak-beams and plar.ks twenty-one inches
thick was lowered and set in position be
neath the water at a distance of seventy
live feet from the muzzle-of the gun._ l>e
hind this target the hull of an old vessel
was towed into position directly in the
line of the fire from the gun.
In order to make the test the more
severe sheets of boiler plate, three inches
in thickness, wÂ«r â¢ riveted to the hull of
the craft at the point where the shell from
the gun woujd strike, if it was not de
flected by the water.
Having made all these preparations the
diver cam*; to the surface, and talcing the
shell with which the experiment Mas to
be made again went below the surface and
carefully loaded the gun, which was then
aimed at the target ana the hull.
A wire connecting with the firing mech
anism of the eun led to the shore some
distance away, where it connected with
an electric battery in charge of the firing
pnrty. The test was made at high tide.
When all the conditions were right the
T word was given and the current sent from
' the battery through the wire to the sub- ,
merged gun. There was a slight disturb
ance of the water over the place where the
gun was sunk, aud the vessel anchored
beyond the target was seen to rock and
sway and then gradually settle ia the
water and sink.
Splinters of wood covered the surface,
and there was every indication that the
experiment had been a succ/ss. At the
next low tide an examination was made
of the sunken vessel, when it was found
that the hull'had been pierced completely
through by the solid shot. The target
was in splinters. The three-inch boiler
plate was in fragments and portions of it
driven into the woodwork of the hull,
while on both sides of the hull balow the
water line were two huge jagged holes big
enough to sink a ship of the line in rive
minutes.
No one was more suvprised at the un
expected results than the experts who
witnessed the tests. They had expected
The Great Elephant Artillery of India
Neither JMire Nor Barricade Pro^e Lasting Obstacles to the
progress of the Tremendous Beasts
Hp\HE elephant has become one of the
vJ"^ most important adjuncts of the
j4f* English army in India. He is at
tached to the artillery in every sense of
the word and drags the biggest guns as if
they were feathers, keeping a steady pace
with the tramp, tramp, tramp of the in
fantry. He is no laggard at any time and
deep indeed must be the mire and high
the barricade which be cannot walk
through or demolish. In one respect the
elephant in artillery is like Napoleon â he
never knows defeat.
The officers and men of the Indian army
have for years been working with the idea
of making the elephant more and more
useful. At first the big beast was usect on
the fortifications for hauling timber and
all Kinds of tasks for which great strength,
absolute obedience and docility were re
quired. Tne elephant is not a particularly
intelligent beast and therefore his prog
ress has been slow along the lines laid
down by the disciples of Mars, Now he
knows a3 well what to do as the best
posted ariilleryman and will bring his gun
to the regimental front with as much pre
cision as the veriest martinet who wields
the sword could desire.
To gnin an accurate idea of the elephant
in service with the artillery a glance at
the accompanying illustration is helpful.
He is shown at rest and on parade, and
to all appearances realizes as well as the
mahout, who perches upon the g ant
head, that he is or. view and must look
his best and btand as straight as the ranks
in front of him. Everybody who knows
anything about ihe elephant is aware of the
fact that when excited he is in the nature
of a terror. Oddly enough, however, tlie
trained elephant rarely gets into thnt
state of mind. With the knowledge he
cains seem to come the power to control
himseif and to do his duty as best be can.
The particular use to which the ele
phant is put in the ar.illery line in India
is as a beast of draught for the heavy bat
teries and the guii3 of the siege trains.
These instruments of war are tremendous
in size and exceedingly heavy. Until the

one of two things â either that the gun
would burst and raise a water
spout, or that the water would deflect the
shell to such an extent that it would go
wide of the mark. On the contrary, the
shot went as direct and accurately as if
fired in the usual manner through the air.
The water appeared to have no effect upon
it, and in no apparent manner destroyed
its effectiveness.
This test has had the effect of opening
tip possibilities of submarine warfare
hitherto undreamed of. Fitted with a
porthole beneath the water line, with the
muzzle protruding and made water
of bullocks. There was, however, no end
of trouble with these beasts. T>ey were
hard to control, and so many of them
were required that they proved a good
deal of a nuisance. So it is that the Brit
ish artilleryman rejoices at the snb titu
tion of the elephant for the bullock. One
elephant will draw without effort a piec.?
of artillery wh:ch a long line of bullocks
would have difliculty in moving at all.
Every one of these heavy batteries
which the elephant moves from place to
place consists of four forty-pounders and
two six and three inch howitzers. While
one elephant can draw, if necessary, a
single piece of artillery, in order not to
strain him at all they are sometimes
paired or driven tandem. For instance,
in such a battery as the one just de
scribed twelve 'elephants are utilized.
These are not ail employed in drawing
the artillery at the same time, for it is
well not to work an elephant too hard,
because if that is done he is apt to become
stubborn, despite his nsual tractabilit}'.
FÂ»r this reason the elephants are 'given
kindiy usage, and under those circum
stances do all that is asked of them.
The elephant battery, or'rather the guns
thereof, is always accompanied by ammu
nition wagons and baggage. Owing tothe
fact that the supply of properly trained ele
phants is limited, bullocksare still utilized
as the beasts of draught Jor the battery
accompaniments. The fact, that 262
bullocks are required to draw the ammu
nition and baggage forms a striking con
trast between their power 3 and those of
the elephants, for the gross weight of the
ammunition and the baggage la infinitely
less than that of the artillery itself.
The ISritish artillerymen do not attempt
to manage the big beasts that draw the
guns. To accomp.'ish this task there ia
employed a staft of twelve mahouts, with
twelve assistants, the latter being under
the command of an official known as jem
adar, or captain. All are natives of India.
Then, besides the elephant company, as it
is called, there are with each battery a
jemadar, six sirdars and 131 drivers who
care for the bullocks. Theretore, it can
be seen that a battery of artillery in India

tight in the same manner as the shaft
holes are kept from flooding the ship,
there is no reason why a ship cannot
steam head on to an enemy and sink
her without firini? a shot abova the water
line.
A single shot fired from the submarine
gun can easily pierce the unarmored por
tion of the huii beneath the water and
sink the ship before those aboard are
aware that they have su3tainpd any in
jury. Torpedo-boats, thus fitted, jan be
made much more effective, as a submarine
shot, as has Dean demonstrated by the
target and the boiler plate, can pierce any
ordinary torpedo guard, ana at the same
time have sufficient force to cause fatal
dumage to an enemy's ship.
As a means of coast defense also these
submarine batteries will be far and away
in advance of the present system of miqÂ«s
and torpedoes. A battery sunk beneath
the surface can be aimed at different ele
vations, and there is almost no limit to
tiie damage a submarine battery could do
among tho unprotected hulls of an invad
ir.e fleet.
amounts to something. In fact, it is a
little army in itself, for every one of the
natives employed is supposed to be com
petent and ready to fight if necessary.
Whenever it happens that the battery is
to be transported a great distance the rail
road is used ss an aid, if it can possibly be
made available. In such cases it is neces
sary, of course, to transport the elephants
by rail, and special cars have been made
far the purpose. These cars are in ap
pearance like the ordinary coal car on an
American railroad, the sides bÂ°ing about
half the height of a -boxcar. At one end
of the car is a small house in appearance,
with one end omitted.
In this little house sits the mahout or
attendant of the elephant, who sees thnt
during the journey he does not become
frightened and has no opportunity of in
juring nimself. Over the rest of the car
there is a framework. There are three
steel posts at each side. Running length
wise and attached to these are two sec
tions of steel of about the size of the ordi
nary pine boarJ.
At thp end, blocking up an opportunity
of egress, are two small steel baams of the
size of the scantling. From the hignest
of the sections of steel on the tide rises a
thin piece of steel to a height which car
ries it just clear of the elephant. Running
from the top of these small pieces of steel
in tie form of the letter V is another steel
section, and tha whole prevents the ele
phant from rising or sitt ng down. He
must either lie down entirely or stand up
straight.
Straight across the car and attached to
the lower section of steel on the sides is a
big beam that keeps the elephant from
being thrown against the end of the car
by a sudden jolt. Entrance and exit from
the car are made by means of a heavy
platform. In this way the elephant 19

from place to place without fear of injury.

elephant battery drawn up at a review in

A Fire Engine With Pneumatic Wheels
It Runs OVer the Roughest Pavements as J^oiselessly as a Bike
Journeys on Gobblestones
Â§ONDON, Eno., March 6.â fire en
tfo\ gine that travels on pneumatic
â¢S""*' wheels, without horses, is astonish-,
ing the Englis&men" nowadays. The only
familiar feature is the everlasting gong
and the helmet of the firemen, although
the line of hose that is seen reeled up in
the rear is an old friend in a new place.
The genius of the inventor has for some
time past been guided in the direction of
the mechanical eatures of the Fira De
partment. The papers have been full of
letters to the editor, whicti the average
Britisher is so fond of writing, and in these
has been a host of suggestions, good, bad
and Indifferent, reearding improvements
which the writers were convinced should
be made, and at once, in the fire appar
atus. There is nothing that the average
Londoner is mora afraid of than fire, and
consequently his mind has a strong bent
toward all that will help to reduce that
dancer to a minimum.
While all these people have been writ
ing and talking a genius has acted, and a
result of his thought and ingenuity is the
tire engine referred to in the first para
graph of this article. A curious looking
engine it is as the accompanying illustra
tion, which was drawn from a photograph,
plainly indicates. Little enough. like the
fire engine one sees in America and en
tirely lacking the hiss, puff and blow and
the clouds of smoke that have heretofore
rendered audible and visible the presence
of the foe of all flames.
The motive power of this engine is gaÃO
lene, ami, as the photograph plainly indi
cates, the engine itself is very different
irom the machine that is ordinarily in use
for the purpose. It is more compact and
Dowerfnl â two improvements that will be
very welcome. In the rear of the engine,
and within the railing, is the fire hose on
the reel of the usual pattern. Thus the
engine and hose cart are in one. Ordi
narily the fireman seizes the hose and un
reels it himself.
With this most up-to-date of fire en
gines, however, there is a contrivance
which will reel or unreel the hose, action
being regulated by a lever close to that
which operates the engine itself. This is
one of the features which firemen find
great cause for enthusiasm. In fact the
London rire-fighters, who are considered
iully equal to the bravest and best, even
as good as the firemen of the United
States, think that tne reel fea.ure is the
point par excellence of the invention.
Generally the engine is supposed to
carry five men, but thi3 number can be
increased if desired, as the additional
weight of a larger crew would have no
appreciable effect upon, the speed, which
is any where from twelve to twenty miles
an hour, according to the size of the en
gine and the desire of the crew, or as the
exigencies of the occasion demand.
Two of the firemen stand on the foot
board of the engine, which makes the en
tire circuit, the contrivance being of an
elongated nature. The fifth man is the
pilot. He stands within the rail, and by
means of a wheel laid flatwise upon an
iron bar steers the queer machine. There
is the usual headlight fjr use at night
located directly forwarl of the wheel bar.
The oddest flatura of the w ole contriv
ance, however, is found in the wheels.
These, as the illustration shows, are huge
pneumatic affairs, the spokes being very
like the steels which are su noticeable in
the bicycle. There are just four of them
to every engine, the same number
that would be required of any other
wheel, but the rirenien, despite the
lightning speed at which they travel, feel
far less of the frightful jolt, constant jog
gling about, like dice in a box, that is
cenerally their fate. Instead, they feel
very little more of the jolting sensation
than one would experience on an ordinary
country road. These wheels are geared
precisely likeanv other wheel, their only
peculiarity being in point of material and
construction.
Contrary to supposition, the wheels, so
far a3 it has been able } to demonstrate
with experiment, show no signs of great
wear. One would naturally think that
such a tremendous weight as this lire en
gine upon rubber would bo apt to make
the yielding substance tear and be lacer
ated.
This is not the case at all. On the con
trary, the wheels show after several trips
little sign of having been in use at all. So
far not a single one has given out and
there has been no lapse of any kind from
lack of air.
Just at the inner rim of every wheel is a
small brass cap which screws down over
an orifice intended for replacing a supply
of air which might leak away.. Of course,
in time a certain amount of air is bound
to escape from a pneumatic tire, and so a
blower is attached to the little motor and
whenever the eng neer thinks that the air
in the tires is getting low he connects tire
and motor, and, presto! the tire 13 as firm
ns the grasp of an office-holder upon a
place under ;he Government.
On each side of the engine and secured
just beneath the footboard is a length of
capped hose, wnich is to be used for a hy
drant connection if desired or coupled
to a regular line. Tue footboard itself
is made of solid oak and Ea^lish oak is
proverbial for its lasting qualities. Eng
lishmen have never forgotten Friar Tuck's
remark, that an oak stove was better than
riches, and when properly wielded worth
much silver ana gold,
i The fittings of the engine, such as shown
n the illustration, are vpry complete and
equally attractive. There is something
which is in a measure inspiring about fire
apparatus to most people, and this new
contrivance, althoug > fashioned queerly
and seemingly, at first, clumsily, prove-*
upon closer inspection to have been con
structed with a view to utility from every
point.
The decorations, while handsome in
great degree, are not in the least gaudy,
butall combine to ive the engine abso
lute harmony of appearance and to im
press the beholder with the idea that the
machine is made for service and nothing
else.
Several severe tests have been given the
machine and it has stood them alt. The
Board of Fire Underwriters is carefully

view of submitting an opinion re
gai ing its usefulness, which will

This Man Was
Telephoned Through
There is only one man in the world who
has been telephoned through. He is
Torger 0. Enderson, a Swede of Rock
Dell, Olmstead County, Minn.
He held the ends of a telephone wire
while people several miles away talked
through him. The electrical current
knocked him down, but he held bravely
to the wires, and the remarkable experi
ment was a complete success. His per
formance has attracted wide attention
among scientific men. Here is the first
account that Mr. Enderson has ever writ
ten concern. na it:
'â¢To the Editor: I believe that I am the
only man in the world who was ever talked
through. It is a strange experience and
one that Ido not care to duplicate. Al
though it occurred very recently, it seems
to have attracted the attention of scient
ists, and I have received a number of in
quiries from them.
"I was getting ready to go and fix up
the telephone wire, which seemed to be
broken somewhere between Rock Dell and
Hayfield. These two towns are seven
miles apart, ana we could not get a mes
sage through at all. The electricity would
not work or the wire was broken, or some
thing was wrong, and as nobody knew
what it was, we had to investigate. We
suspected it was a broken wire, and so J.
W. Lundale, tne operator at Rock Dell,
BEHOLD THE NEW MOTOR FIRE-ENGINE!
asked me to go out and find the trouble.
If it was a broke:) wire, he said, he wanted
me when I got the j.lace to take hold of the
two ends, so that he could send a message
through me.
"You see, he wanted mo to be the con
nection between the two broken ends of
the wire. You know, when you tnlk
through the telephone, it ain't, the sound
wave from your voice that goes over the
wire, but it is an electrical vibration. So
it was this electrical vibration that was
to go through me. I was afraid to try
it, but Lundale told me that there
would not be any danger at all, and so 1
sata i would, provided it was a broken
wire tbnt caused the trouble. Lundale
and I set our watches at the same time
and I started out to hunt np the break. It
was a sure enough break, and it happened
about three miles from Rock Dell.
"1 looked at my watch after I got to the
broken wire and iound that I had forty
minutes to get ready to be the connection.
I mado a ioop on each end of the broken
ends of the wire so I could get a good
hold and there would be no mistake about
the connection being all right. I had not
pone alone to this place, as there were
four men with meâ Y< rkel Jortenseon,
Martin Hanson, Cyrus Rier^on and An
drrw Olson. After a while it got to be the
time when I had a^reel with Lundalo to
try the experiment. I took hold of the
loops and Martin Hanson held the watch.
Then Lundale called up Haylield, the
call for which is two rings I could feel
in my body what station was called. If
somebody had hit me on the hoad twice
when Lundale called Hayfield it would
not have been any plainer tome.
"Hayfie:d did not answer at first, and
Lundale called it ud three times. The
last time was too much for me and I leil
to the ground, losing hold ol one wire. I
was not hurt ai^y, only just knocked
down, and I grabbed hold of the wire that
bad dropped. After a couple of minutes
Lundale called up Oslo. I could feel the
five short rings for that place just like five
thrills going through me After a little
while Lundale called up Dodge Center by
three rings. It was pretty hard for me,
but I stood it, for I had made up my mind
that I would not give in just as long as I
could hold myself together, but when
Lundale gave Austin a call he rang me
down as flat as a pancake. I never did
know what the Austin call was, but I
think it takes a pretty good long ring to
get the town.
"liven this did not hurt me, bo I got up
after a minute or two and took bold of tho
ends of t:e wire and made the connection
for the answer from Austin. I managed
to hold out until the time Lundale and I
hail agreed that I was to hold the wire
was up. Then I fixed the wire, and we all
went back to Rock Dell. When I got back
to Dell Lundale told me that while I was
holding ttie wires he got an answer from
Oslo, which was seven miles away. He
had also bad a talk with Doiipe Center,
which is twenty miles from tho Dell. He
had quite a talk with Austin, forty miles
away, but he did not hear from Hayfield)
which, I oelieve, was because the operator
at that place was not cere when the call
came. There is no reason why he should
not have answered if he had heard the
ring.
"1 cannot say that my experience as a
means of connection of telephone wires
hurt me any to amount to anything. Of
course the electricity jerked my muscles
terribly. I seemed to suffer the moat in
my arms, particularly in that arm that
was holding the broken wire that ran to
ward the Dell. All the while the talking
was going on I felt hard shocks in my
chest, but I can hardly explain how it
really felt. Just the same, if anybody is
thinking of trying the same thing who has
not very strong nerves, they had better
tuke my advice and give the idea up.
"You see, k dues not make any differ
ence how strong a man is; if he has not
got good nerves electricity does not agree
with him. I've had lots of little shocks
in fixing telephone wires, but they never
have made me lame or anything of that
kind before. It seems to me that there
must have been a highly powerful current
of electricity passing along that wire when
I acted as the connection. I remember at
a fair once talcing hold of the handles of
one of those machines that they give you
electric shocks with, and that made me
feel just a very little bit like I felt when I
was holding those broken wire 1 !. Besides
th-.' pains in my chest and in my, arms I
felt just as if somebody was pricking me a
little all over, and then as if in some way
or other they had been able to grab hold
01 my nerves and give them little pulls.
'"I am not at all nervous and it takes a
good deal to startle me, so I was not scared
at all while these things I have written
about were going on. It never seemed to
me that as long as you were careful there
was any danger In letting a little elec
tricity into you. It a.l depends how you
do it. I thought of nil those things when
1 was holding these wires. When it came
so fast that it knocked me to the ground
I thought it was getting sort of strong, but
I did not feel there was any reason for me
to be frightened. T. O. End-rson."
Mr. Enderson'a experience was certainly
most remarkable. That he waa able to
endure the continued shocks and be none
the worse for acting as a conductor lor a
tremendous currant of electricity falls
little short of the marvelous. It is no
exaggeration to say that ninety-nine per
sons out of 100 woul I have neariy died,
had they grasped tne ends of the broken
wires. These wires were not exactly what
are known as live, when broken, but im
mediately the connection was formed and
the telephone put into use they practically

AT THE THEATRES
fF^LEVER old Sardou I there may
â¢l^*Â« still be differences of opinion
I^^/T about bis being a great dram
atist, but every one must reverentially
own that he is the press agent of
the century. The wily old fellow has not
made a single convert by his new play
â¢â¢Spiritism" (Spiritualism), and his fellow
mediums are pained and disgusted beyond
measure at his banal treatment of "mani
festations," but what does Sardou care? He
has secured whole lots, acresâ
miles of free advertising, in the French
papers, and as a consequence on the open
ing nieht, at the Renaissance in Paris
spiritualists and skeptics almost fought
one another to get into the theater to sea
"Spiritism."
The play was produced simultaneously
on this side by Charles Frohman, but
tbero are no press agents in New York
like Sardou to keep the thing booming, so
discussions on Spiritualism have not
crowded the bombardment in Crete and
the McKinley inauguration out of the
American papers. In Paris the press for
â¢weeks devoted whole .pages to "Spiritual
Manifestations Through Mr. Sardou's
Eyes, 1 ' "Is Sardou Really a Medium?"
etc, etc. Sardou cunningly started the
controversy by declaring that "Spiritism"
would be his confession of faith, his credo.
This was the signal for a light on the pros
and cons of Spiritualism, in which oceans
of printers' ink were shed. The contro
versy lasted lor weeks, but Sardou knew
how to keep np interest to the bitter end.
Just before the first performance it was
declared that all the performers had be
come converted to the new relieion by
dint of rehearsing "Spiritism," Bremont
recalled that he had once turned tables,
Laroche was shaKen in his unbelief, and
even the divine Sarah showed a hitherto
unexpected yearning for the occult. On
the day of the last rehearsal at the Re
naissance Sardou gathered bit actors
round him and told them how and why
he became a Spiritualist The recital oc
cupied columns and coiumns of type, and
as he had taken care that the great dra
matic critics were there too, Sardou had
the pleasant experience next day of see
ing the budding aspirations of Prince
George of Greece shoved into obscure cor
ners of the newspapers and "Mr. Sardou
Tells How He Became a Spiritualist"
given a place of honor.
Cariosity to see the play was intense,
and spiritualists and skeptics vied with
one another to get seats first, but as
"Spiritism" unrolled its somewhat weary
length, it did not succeed in convincing
any one; the unbelievers remained bru
tally skeptical, and in the loyer between
thÂ« acts they said : "It is Saran who makes
the play. Isn't she great; younger and
greater than ever I"
The Spiritualists whispered among
themselves that Sardou had committed a
grave fault against the new religion,
â¢â¢making a spectacle of it, and exposing
the high and noble manifestations of
spirits to the laughter of fools â this will
certainly bring him some occult chastise
ment." As an aftermath to the great
Bardou-Spiritualist controversy the French
papers are asking: "What will Sardou's
occult chastisement be?'
There is nothing mean or bigoted about :
Sardou; he lets the Spiritualists and their i
opponents In his play have full fliDg to
argue, and counter-argue, till the audience i
T'onders where it will all end â at least ne j
doss this in the French version. 1 have
not seen Mr. Fronman's adaptation. The
hero of "Spiritism," d'Aubenas, is a
gentleman with more taste for getting
switched on to the spirits ot his late
lamented relatives than for holding sweet
converse with Simone, his living wife, j
The fair Simone so resents this invidious i
distinction that when the play opens she
is on the eve of flight with a Roumanian
adventurer, Miknael Stroudza. The fol
lowing conversation, which . passes in j
d'Aubenas' villa, is a sample ot what |
S.mone fled from. The talkers are I
d'Aubenas, Dr. Davidson, a Scotch me- j
dmm; Dr. Parisot, an obstinate old fel
low who won't go to a seance for fear of
being converted, and Dcs Aubiers, a friend
of d'A'ibenas:
Parisot (scornfully taking off his gloves;â
You have seen Dr. Davidson perform?
D'Aubenasâ Three times. The first three
seances were curious, nothing more, but that
of yesterday was startling.
Parisot (sitting on the lounge)â Mere trick
ery.
D'Aubenasâ Judge for yourself. This table,
which hed done nothing more than turn and
answer our questions by very distinct taps,
suddenly stole away from tho contact of our
hands and turned by itself all round the room;
then it rose up high from the floor, and after
having floated in ihe air for some seconds fell
back softly onto the carpet.
Parisot (still skeptical)â All that I suppose
took place in total darkness?
D'Aubenasâ Not at all, It was ai light as it
Is now.
Dcs Aubiers (calming in)â l felt a touch on
my shoulder and by instinct felt the place and
my hand came in contact with another.
Parisotâ Made of fiber.
Dcs Aubiersâ A hand of flesh, warm, supple,
palpitating. I drew away my hand and the
other stretched itself out and touched Mares
cot's heed. He cried outâ
Marescotâ That is to say â
Dee Mibiersâ l mean he howled outâ after
which the hand grasped thru of Mr. d'Aube
nas, who seized It and tried to hold It, but it
melted away in his grasp and dissolved into
vapor.
D'Aubenasâ That's so.
Parisotâ Was that all?
D'Aubenanâ ol), no. Directly after the clock
nagan to strike little, silvery strokes like the
beating of au insect's wings.
Parisotâ Oh, some night-moth imprisoned
In the works of the ciock. As for the rest

Is nothing simpler. It was Instinctive mus
cular impulse. And the hand â cerebral ex
citement, auto-suggestion.
Dcs Aubiersâ Oh, excuse me, excuse me! We
heard and saw for ourselves.
The controversy rages until it assumes the
ponderous reasonings of a co'lege debate, as
you will see from the following, which is
hurled at the unbelieving Parisot's head by
Dr. Davidson:
"The most learned men, the most competent
men, those who carry the most weight of au
thority on account of position and character,
believe In manifestations. Only to quote Eng
land as an example, doctors, physiologists
like Gully and Eil.tson, physicians such as
I.o'lep, astronomers like Cballis. mathema
ticians like Morgan, naturalists like Sir
Russell Wallace, engineers like my friend
Verify, inventor of the electric condenserâ all
members of the Royal Society or professors of
the exact sciences at the universities of
London, Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow and
Dublinâ all bear witness to the incst remprk
abie phenomena. The most bigoted in favor
of spiritualism are precisely those who hnve
studied it In order to show its absurdity,
among others the eminent chemist, William
Crookes, whose example is typical." * â¢ â¢
And so on and so on, via dicendo, till ParlÂ«ot,
â¢ M i Hardened in unbelief, gels up and puts on
his gloves, saying: "Enfln, if you have savants
to attest to your facts, there are also more
savants who deny them."
Davidsonâ Especially those who think them
selves infallible ard who, like yourself, have
refused to make any investigation.
Parisotâ lt is no use studying what does not
exist.
Davidsonâ What tells you spiritualism does
not exist T
Parisotâ Common-sense.
Davidsonâ Ah, poor good sense! Is It re
sponsible for all the errors laid at its door?
It was in its nnine that the rotundity of the
earth was denied; it was in its name that they
said that the people of the antipodes walked
head downwards, and said to Christopher Co-
Davidson gives examples of Idiotic things
said and done in the name of common-sense,
but Parisot, who is still unconvinced, takes his
departure with the Parthian shot: "Human
patience has its limits, but human credulity
has none."
People interested in occultism wonld no
doubt find the whole debate interesting to
read, but it is hard to see how it can ad
vance the act:on of a play. In the second
act Sardou leaves debating alone, for
Simone hss to be dealt with. Her adven
tures resemble those of the Princess de
Chiraay, with the addition that d'Aube
nas erroneously believes his wife has been
burnt in a railway accident. In tue final
act she appears to him clothed in white,
like a phantom, and begs his forgiveness.
He grants pardon to what he believes is
his wife's spirit, but as she flings herself
into his arms he sees that she is really a
creature of flesh and blood.

in without much regard to their ap
propriateness. In fact, when the char
acters burst into song the sentiments they
express are sometimes the reverse of what
they have been saying in prose. The mu
sical-costume-comedy has a well-detined
plot, but stands badly in need of a chorus
to impart animation and movement, par
ticularly in the market scene.
Nanon, the flower-girl, lives all by her
self in a mansion at the corner of the mar
ket, and across the way seils flowers in
one of those nice little kiosks that the
municipality of Paris das thoughtfuliy
provided for venders of newspapers, etc.
Nanon is supposed to have lived over a
century ago, but she is only anticipating
modern improvements by having her
kiosk. It is scarcely correct to say that
she sells flowers, for the only people who
ever appear in the market are a baker (in
love witn Nanon), Miss Alice Gaillard,
who plays the part of the presiding genius
of a vegetable stand, and titled people and
tneir hirelings from the court of Louis
XIV, who come and go without buy'.ng
anything. This may be the reason why
Miss Rice decks herself out with her
flowers, like Ophelia, only more so, for her
hat looks like a roof garden, and birds
would be tempted to build their nests in
her corsage and skirts.
Nation is a very virtuous little flower
girl, so every one says, but tbe audience
is offered no explanation of tbe fact that,
although her hand and heart ar* pledged
to the comic baker, she sings "Oh, swear
to be good and true to the maiden yon say
that you adore" (called from "Dorothy")
with the arm of a wick d marquis round
her waist. This marquis has made a bet
that the flower-girl snail be his with a
baron whom Nanon calls: "You disrep
utable old roue, you." Alter the flower
girl has asked tne marquis to "swear to be
good and true," he is scarcely to be
blamed lor not taking her seriously when
she says: "Get alonu, marquis, my heart
is another's" (meaning the baker's).
The Marquis makes a Machiavellian plot
to kidnap her. Disguising his varlets as
soldiers of the period he Bends them forth
to arrest a fugitive chevalier, whom
Nanon, with the most worthy motives,
has been shielding from justice in her
mansion. The chevalier, who is always
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
popping out of the mansion and delving
the police to find him, ha> just finished a
love duet with his sweetheart, Mile.
Vivienne de Villianne, sister of the
wicked marquis, when the soldiers are
sighted in the far, far distance. Nanon
has time to change clothes with the che
valier, and thinks she has hoodwinked
the enemy nicely by being arrested in her
friend's place, but the wicked marquis
laughs "Ah! Ah!" in the background, be
cause the ilower-girl was the very person
be wanted.
When they get Nanon to the abode of
the Marquis they incite her to drink
brandy, smoke a long clny pipe and
otherwise act as befits a noble chevalier.
Meanwhile the Sadv who presides at the
vejetable stand has gone to the King and
procured a royal decree commanding the
marquis to marry Nanon or he imprisoned
in the Bastile. Complications too numer
ous to describe ensue, but in the end
Nanon shows a fine scorn for titles. She
actually does not want to become a mar
quise and gives her hand to the comic
but bibulous baker.
Miss Rice's little bit of fat in "A Flower-
Girl of Paris" is where she tries to act like
a swaggering chevalier. Several of the
members of the company sing and act
acceptably, but they cannot sing and act
away tbe impression that the piece ought
to have been au opera bouffe.

Every one interested in Miss Davenport
is anxious to know what sne is to do
next season, and also anxious to know
what she is to do with the Sardou
plays when sho is done with them.
Even her old stage manaser, who has
been with her ever since she com
menced starring, has no idea of her plans
for next season, and no one is to know
until this season is over, the actress de
claring herself pledged to secrecy. A very
close friend recently, at rehearsal, asked
Miss Davenport to give her a hint. Miss
Davenport laughed. Then she pointed to
the paint-frMme high above her hea<l and
exclaimed, "Do you see that?" The friend
n. dded. "Well,' 1 she said, "if I play in
this house next season, and I exrect to. I
snalJ jump from that in the play I pro
duce," and that is as much a-< any one
knows of Davenport's plans up to date.
Rumor nays that the new play is on an
American subject, but even on that point
Miss Davenport is silent.
Dramatic Brevities.

during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or soli'i
Hoes, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso

word "hich" means high barometric pressure aDd
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
| refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
: and accompanied by ciondv weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain la probable:
but when the "low- is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able." With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
' Â«-eÂ«ttier may be expected In summer and colder
' weather In winter. The reverse of these condition!

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. March 6 âDespite the warlike
tenor of the press dispatches this morning the
barometer of the European political situation,
British cotfsols, were quiet and steady. This was
a serious backset to the bull movement in wheat.
Furthermore Liverpool cables quoted only a slight
advance, showing Indifference and less anxiety at
that place. Prices in this market opened at a de- '
cline of Vie to Vie from yesterday. A rail .â  to yes- i
terday's figures then took place, the strength' be- !
ing Imparted by "shorts" covering.' -When that '
demand was satisfied a reaction took place.
Receipts in the Northwest were liberal at 327
cars, atÃlnst 230 las'. Saturday and 41)4 a year
ago. Chicago receipts, 2J cars, and 32.538
bushels were inspected out. The week's shipments
from both coasts were light at 2,075.000 b ishels, I
against 2,408.000 bushels for the corresponding {
week a year ago. Argentine shipments this week j
were 192,000 bushels. Cosine continental cable i j
wÂ»-re irregular. Export clearance* were lieht at I
138.168 bushels. -May wheat opened at 763/gC to 1
761,8 ' ; sold between 76% c and 76c, closing at '
.76(a.76VgC, Vi@% : under yesterday. Estimated j
receipts lor Monday. 14 cars. No. 2 reJ, spot,
wheat was quotably ss(Â§,B~Vie and closed about
85cto88Vic
: COKNâ corn market was stealy generally,
the opening, however, bring easy, partly through
the Influence of the quieting cables an<t partly In
sympa.by 'with wheat. The large exports from I
bbth Coasts for the <veek, 5,255.006 busheU. were
a factor in affording sus aiiiing power. Receipts 1
were 290 cars, and 1Â«2? bushels were taken from j
store. Liverpool cables were 1.4(1 higher, but 1
quiet.' Heavy buying by a promi:iant snippin; |
house Imparted strength later. Export clearances
were heavy at 778,657 bushels. Awn i - ship
ments were light at 40,000 bmheis. May con
opened at 24Vjtc sola between tout and -4-<4c,
closing at i.'45 /B e. unchanged from yesterday. Es
timated receipts for Monday 270 cars.
OAToâ The trade in oats was light and the tone
steady. he same consideration which tended to
restrain bullish ardor in wheat and corn was ef- {
fective In oats. Receipts were â '! 37 cars There
were no withdrawals from store. Kxport clear
ances were 5U.000 bushels. May oats closed a
shade under yesterday. Estimated receipts for
Monday 600 cars. Â«

PROVISIONSâ Ttie run of hogs at the yarai
this mo/ning was little more than half the num
ber exacted. An advance of sÂ®lo cents in prices
at that place was the result, and product received
stimulus from that circumstance- May pork

One of the greatest diving feats ever
achieved was in moving the cargo of the
ship Cape Horn, wrecked off the coast of
South America, when an English diver
made seven descents 10 a depth. of over
200 feet, remaining at one time forty-two
rainuies underwater. An authority states
that the greatest depth to which man has
been known to descend does' not exceed
220 leet, which is equivalent to a pressure
of 88>$ pounds to me square inch. Â«

THE MONEY TANGLE
Result of the Important
Monetary Conference at
Indianapolis.
Agreement Upon a Standard and
the Issuance of One Sound
Paper Currency.
Executive Committeeman John P. Irish
Explains tue Proposed Check on
Congestion of Capital.
The following interesting facts regard
ing the recent monetary conference in
Indianapolis were gathered from John P.
Irish, the local delegate, and who was also
appointed a member from California of
tue executive committee:
"The monetary conference held in Indi
anapolis on January 12 last was composed
of delegates from forty States, met to con
fer upon means of bring. ng sharply to the
attention of Congress the need of currency I
reform and the introduction into our
financial systf m of stronger elements of
stability and flexibility.
"The conierence agreed upon the stand
ard of values, upon the necessity of taking
the treasury out of the banking business
:ind of reducing our six or seven form? of !
paper currency to one, National in its
origin and character, based upon the same
general principles as the present National
bank note.
'â¢The issue of such a currency, it was
agreed, must be under guarantees as sound
as the foundation of the National bank
note?, but under a banking system which
will promote its circulation instead of its
retiremenr, as now.
"This system, it was agreed, must be
framed to DUt the surplus capital â the
loan iund of the country â where credit
can acquire its U:e in the field of produc
tion in the South and West, aa well as in
the manufacturing and mercantile centers
of the East. The present tendency to
congest capital in the centers, whence its
flow to aid agriculture and transportation
in the wheat, corn, cotton, tobacco and
fruit growing field is sIUL-gisli and costly,
was regarded as tne odium of the Na
tional banking system, which requires at
tention.
"To project its organized force into the
settlement of tt.e problem the conference
ordered its president, Hon. C. Stuart .Pat- j
terson of Philadelphia, to appoint an ex- j
ecutive committee, which is to urge Con
gress at the extra session to authorize the
President of the United States to appoint
a commission, non-partisan in its charac
ter and representing production, manu- j
facture, commerce and banking, to exam
ine the whole currency problem and
report to Congress a solution in the form
of a bill.
"Immediately following the favorable
expression in President McKinley's in
augural, Mr. Patterson has announced
the following executive committee to
represent the conference: H. H. Hannn, j
Indiana (chairrann); M. L. Crawiord, i
Texas; W. B. Dean, Minnesota; J. W. ;
Fries, North Carolina; J. F. Hansen, j
Georgia; C. C. Harrison, Pennsylvania; !
Rowland Hazard, Rhode Island; John P.
Irish, California; H. H. Kohlsaat, Illi
nois; J. J. Mitchell, Illinois; Alexander
E. Orr. New York; George Forta Pea
bodv, New York; T. C. Power. Montana;
E. O. Stsnard, Missouri; A. E. Willson,
Kentucky.
"These* gentlemen will present tne sub
ject to Congress tuis month, and there is
no doubt that wise and speedy action will
be taKen. The State Association of
Bankers meets shortly in Los Angeles,
and will probably express itself upon this
subject."
ACTING SUSPICIOUSLY.
Two Ex- Convicts and Another Young
Man Arrested With Burglars'
Tools on Them.
Four young men were seen by Police
man David Murphy to be acting in a sus
picious mannerat the north end of Gqugh
Btreet Friday afternoon-. As he approached
them three of them ran away. Murphy
searched the one that remained, but found
nothing incriminating in his possession.
He proved to be James Dacey, an ex-con
vict.
While Murphy was searching Dacey two
of the trio that ran away returned. Mur
phy insisted upon searching them and
iound a lot of skeleton keys on one of
them, he allowed Dacey to go, but took
the other two to the City Prison, where
the one that had the skeleton keys was
recognized as Frank Howard, an ex-con
vict. The oiher pave his name as John
Burns, but the police do not know him.
Murphy thought he saw Burns throw
something away, and he returned to
Gough street and found an iron bar, a
'jimmy" and a picklock.
Dacey was arrested yesterday by De
tectives Gibson and Wren, as the police
believe that he and the others have com
mitted several daylight burglaries in the
Western Addition and North Beach. Un
less some evidence can be procured against
them Howard will be charged with hav
ing burglars' tools in his possession and
Dacey and Burns with vagrancy.
LOUIS GOSCH'S DEATH.
William Brugge Arraigned in Judge
Lov'i Court.
William Brugge was arraigned in Judce
Low's court yesterday morning for the
murder of Louis Gosch in a saloon at Fre
mont-street wharf Friday afternoon. The
case was continued till Friday next, pend
ing the result of the Coroner's inquest.
It is the intention of the Police Depart
ment to revoke the license of the pro
prietor of the Martin Mine saloon on
Pacific and Front streets for the part he
took in endeavoring to defeat justice by
attempting to assist Brugge to escape.
Lecture by Judge Morrow.

children, and even his sisters and his
cousins and his aunts.
War against the poor folks, who shiver
in their rags and bee for work until neces
sity and hunger drive them to stealing
and killing. The poor are always sure of
one shelter, one little space of repose, and
when pride is lost in the dizzy twain, the
ptison cell looks from afar, like a fairy
palace tilled with enchanted beings. A
policeman seems like one of the good genii,
and nis rough grasp seems to the starving
wretch like the gentle guiding hand of an
angel. Oh, the poor of great cities are as
the lean rats in the haunted castles of the
Rhine! Pity them!
War has broken out among the noble
ministers of the holy gospel, and like a
lot of magpies they are arguing and de
bating such "weighty" (?) subjects as
Jonah's restful days inside the narrow
stomach of a whale. As a whale's throat
is remarkably small some of the blushing
wiseacres declare that it was a shark's
stomach in which Jonah bo peacefully
reposed until said shark was harpooned
(or something like that) and Jonah was
permitted to step out upon the sandy
beach and return to his friends and
kindred. A number of sober-browed
clergymen have boidly stepped forward
and called the whole story a bad little
naughty "white lie." But what's the use?
Perhaps Jonah â well, it's a deep subject,
and my plummet will not serve to fathom
the dense depths.
Then there is a war begun against the
laws of marriage. Some poor deluded
legislator, yearning for popular notoriety,
has introduced a bill in the New York
Legislature making it necessary for a
prospective bridegroom to make formal
application at the clerk's office several
days before the marriage license is
granted. Think of a couple of hearts
throbbing and bursting with love having
to wait days before the marriage cere
mony can be legally performed! Mar
riage should be encouraged, not dis
couraged. Many a young couple would
run out and be married and live happy
ever after if it were not the custom to
have gay wedding bells and fruk-caKe and
old shoes filled with rice, and a lot of use
less articles called a trousseau and the
"bless-you-my-children" ceremony to
wade through. Let the young folks
marry when they please, how they please
and wherever they please. Tne world
needs more marriages. The welfare of
this great land depends upon the legal
union of true lovers and gentle sweet
hearts Discourage these comfortable
"bachelor clubs," frown on the "asso
ciated leagues of bachelor - maids and
widows" and make those mateless ones
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.
HALE BROS
yearn for homes and families. That's the
way to do it! Who will start the move
ment?
Californians are proverbially clannish,
and as our own little Edna Wallis Hopper
is a general New York favorite we are
naturally very proud of her and her re
markable advancement in the theatrical
and comic opera world. At present she
and her tall husband, De Wolf Hopper,
are playing Sousa's "El Capitan" at the
Broadway.
True to his principles as a native of the
sunny coast Louis Sonnikson, the genial
and popular merchant o'. San Jose, invited
a half dozen Californians to attend trie
performance of "El Capitan" last Wednes
day evening. It was a stag theater party
and the happiest little group to be found
in town that night. Perhaps pretty Edna
did not Know it, but six big hearts beat a
tat-too of greeting to her and six pairs of
honest hands were about blistered from
applauding every little song she piped and
every little dance step she made. Oh,
they were a jolly crowd, not noisy, mind
you, but so happy and Californiaesque.
Of course, a supper at the Imperial fol
lowed, and there were memories to recall
and stories to relate and appropriate
toasts to offer; until the hands of the big
clock across the way suggested that morn
ing was growing old. They hurried out
into the frosty air, and after many hand
shakes and adieus to their host, Mr. Son
nikson, who was to start homeward thÂ«
next evening, they parted, softly hum
ming: "Viva la, viva la, viva l'amour,
viva la companie."
These merry young men were Leonard
Robinson of Robinson Bros. & Co., San
Francisco; Joe L. Dlnkelspielof San Fran
cisco, Lawrence Archer, son of Judge
Lawrence Archer of San Jose; David M.
Foltz, the New York representative for
The Call, and C, H. Gray of Cluett, Coon
& Co., San Francisco.
On Friday afternoon the Professional
Woman's League gave their fourth annual
reception in the grand ballroom of the
Waldorf Hotel. It was a great success
and one of the most brilliant gatherings of
the season. Every one of note in the
world of music, art and letters was
present.
The little Los Angeles nightingale, Miss
Ethel Irene Stewart, sang two beautiful
songs, which were received most enthusi
astically. Yon Biene, the celebrated cel
loist, listened attentively, and afterwards
remarked to a friend: "It is amazing to
bear such a marvelous voice come from
such a baby faca. 1 '
Miss Stewart'deplores her youthful face â
but it is a charm to be proud of.
Tall, stately and rich-voiced Olive
Oliver, another talented Caiiiornian, took
part in a little skit which bad been pre
pared by Miss Mary Shaw, entitled "The
First "Woman's Jury." It was rather
rough on the brainy women of to-day, for
it made twelve jury women act like a lot
of silly schoolgirls. However, it accom
plished the desired purpose, for every one
laughed and enjoyed it aud declared it
"just like a lot of women."
Poor women !
Mrs. Frank Leslie, looking very hand
HALE BROS
some and well gowned, was at the recep
tion.
Mrs. A. M. Palmer, president of the
leaeue, cave a most interestinir and digni
fied address, which met wita many con
gratulations.
Among the crush were such well-known
people as Lillian Ilussell, glowing with
health and beauty; Mrs. Julia Marlowe
Tuber and her husband, Kobert Taber,
both looking very much alike with their
dimpled chins and high white foreheads.
Then there was dear old Mr?. John Drew,
who is looking in the best of healih, and
who. by the way, delivered her lines in
the "First Jury of Women" farce with all
the vim and spirit of Mrs. Malaprop's
da vs.
Joe Holland, Henry Miller, Viols Allen
and Daniel Frohman moved about in the
throng exchanging pleasantries with
friends, and pretty Nanette Comstock, our
talented San Franciscan, looked very
plump and happy as she stood with her
whiie-hnired husband, the distinguished
looking Frank Burbeck.
Altogether the league reception may be
considered the most successful ever given
before by any woman's club in New York.
W. H. Wright of San Jose left for the
West on Thursday, anticipating a short
stay in Chicago en route.
Athole McÃean arrived Saturday and is
stopping at the Continental.
Miss Gertrude Rutledge is at the St.
Cloud.
Apropos, they have a way of pronounc
ing St. Cloud in New York which defies
description, for 'tis neither French, Irish
nor English. The other evening a young
Westerner jumped into a hansom and
said, "Drive me to the Saint Cloud." The
cabby looked very wise, and answered,
"You mean the 'Sang Clew,' don't you,
sir?" "No; I mean the St. Cloud; drive
ahead," said the Westerner. "Well," an
swered the suDerior cabby, "I'll drive you
around to the 'Sang Clew.' sir, and if that
isn't the place you mean I'll go to the
place you say, sir."
N. Wines of San Francisco reached the
city Siturday morning, and is registered
at the Hotel Continental.
Al' L. Flickinger, the successful fruit
packer of San Jose, arrived in town Friday
night. He declares that the demand for
California canned and dried fruits are in
greater demand this year than ever be
fore. This must be welcome intelligence
to the fruit-growers throughout the State.
M. L. Stone, who is attending the busi
ness department of "Adolphe's" on Fifth
avenue, it not particularly enthusiastic
over the Eastern climate. He says the
"weather is good enough, but the climate
is not all it might be." Mr. Stone is liv
ing at the Hotel Vendome.
Dr. Ernest W. Auzal, who was so promi
nent for several years in the army and
navy circles of San Francisco, has been
meeting with great success as a specialist
on nervous diseases ever since he left the
navy, two years ago, and took up his resi
dence in New York. Dr. AuzaJ has lately
taken new and handsome apartments at
51 West Fiftieth street. He has been
elected a member of the New York
Neurological Society.
Mrs. Charles Winthrop of Oakland, with
her two daughters, is visiting friends out
near the Park. They will return home
before Easter.
I. George Mooser, who but recently re
turned from an enjoyable visit to Califor
nia, says that if the United States Govern
ment proclaims war against Spain, he will
enlist as a soldier and fight for the cause
of right and justice. He longs to die
bravely or Jive as a hero.
Mrs. Winnifred Black, the gifted and
popular 'Annie Laurie," has been very ill
during the past month, and was obliged to
HALE BROS
go to the Bermudas for health and rest. The
warm, balmy climato of the southern
islands has aided in restoring her health
to a remarkable degree, and letters from
her give the news of her return to New
York during the coming week. She and
Mr. Black are planning to return to Cali
fornia in the near future.
Long ere this letter reaches Its destina
tion Me Km ley will have received the power
of office. What will his term mean to the
millions of loyal men and women in these
United States? It seems like reading the
history of the Chaideans and Egyptians
when one looks ahead four years and real
izes that McKinley will step down and out
of the White House on March 3, 1901 A.D.
Won't it seem odd to write 1901 A.D.?

Mi Â«. M. A. Harding of London Thinks
Ho HaÂ» Been Murdered by Butler.
Mr 3. M. A. Harding of 19 Knatchbull
road, Camberwell, London, C. E., has
written 10 United States Commissioner
Heacock stating that she fears Butler, the
Australian murderer, has made away with
her son.
She states that her son went to Aus
tralia about ten years ago, and up to 1891
wrote home repularly. His last letter
mentioned the fact that he was going on
a prospecting tour with three other per
sons, and the mother fears that he may
have fallen in with Butler. This is un
. likely, as Butler was In this City in 1891.
Since he left home young Harding uas
fallen heir to a por'.ion of his father's es
tate and is being searched for by his rela
tives.

A wholesale paper dealer in New York City relates that his first expe-
rience with Rlpans Tabules began iS months ago. Prior to that he could
not recall a time when he was not troubled with constipation. iNothing
gave more than temporary relief ; but, since taking
Ripans Tabules
nobody has had more perfect digestive organs than he. The bowels
perform their functions with regularity ; there is no distress after eating,
no headache, no heartburn, no dizzinessâ nothing of a dyspeptic nature.
The same gentleman also relates that " if he occasianally stays a little too
kte at the club and meets convivial companions, a Tabule taken before
going to bed wards off every unpleasant after effect."
