GOMEZ GETTING
VERY CLOSE TO
CUBA'S CAPITAL
* - - 1 j
Spaniards Badly Routed by
Advancing Insurgent
Forces.
THIRTY-TWO GUERRILLAS ARE
HANGED AS TRAITORS.
Notwithstanding Weyler's Reports of Pacifi
cation the Cubans Boldly Invade
Havana Province and Strike a
Decisive Blow*
HAVANA, Cuba, May 10. â Eighty
wounded Spanish soldiers have been
brought to Havana by railroad, lt is
believed tbey fought in a battle against
General Gomez.
At a late hour it is said that Gomez is
}rÂ» Havana province and that a big battle
was fought yesterday near Guinez, thirty
miles from the city of Havana, in which
the Spaniards were routed with heavy
losses.
The sensation this has produced here is
Tery great. Not a single word has been
allowed to b3 published here about Go
mez's march. At an earlier hour intense
excitement was created here by the news
that Gomez was at Bermeja, Matanzas
province, ten or fifteen miles from the
border of Havana province. The entire
guerrilla force of Bermeja was captured
by Gomez. Ten of these were released
later and returned to the Spanish out
posts, declaring that the commander of
the Cuban forces, who had a talk with
them, was Gomez himself. They declare
he has about 2000 well-armed men, almost
all cavalry. It is said among Cuban sol
diers that the Cuban general Francisco
Carrillo is following Gomez with 3000
men, and ia now probobly in about the
center of Matanzas province.
The Bermeja guerrilla band captured
by* Gomez was composed of forty-two
men, thirty-two being Cubans employed
by the Spanish on account of their knowl
edge of the country. Gomez freed the ten
Spaniards and ordered the thirty-two
Cubans hanged on the spot as traitors.
The order, was immediately executed.
This military movement of Gomez fol
lowing closely upon the great military
march of General Banderas from Santiago
de Cuba to Pinardel Rio is a decisive blow
in the campaign against Weyler.
The crimes of Colonel Fonsdeviella in
in Gnanabacoa are in full course again.
Yesterday some fifteen Spanish soldiers
entered the house of a Cuban named Ri
carao Rodrieuez and arretted him. His
wife interfered in his behalf. She was
tied to a chair, gagged and assaulted.
Rodriguez was put in chains, dragged
out of town to the old place of execution,
â  where so many murders have been com
mitted by order of Fonsdeviella. There
he was slain.
Weyler arrived yesterday at Sancti
Spiritus. Ex-Governor of Havana Porrua
and General Figueroa sailed for Spain to
day, the latter on sick leave. Ten politi
cal suspects, nine cattle-stealers and
twelve nanigos were deported to-day to
the African penal colonies.
Teodoro Menedez Gonzales was shot to
day at Cabanas for the crime of rebellion.
SPA IX WEARY or WAV,
60 She Is Willing to Give Up on Any
Kind of lerms.
HAVANA, Cuba, May 10.â Dispatches
j from Madrid state that it is the general
! belief in tbat city that negotiations of the
greatest importance to Cuba are now in
j progress between the Spanish Govern
; ment and that of the United States. Just
what the negotiations may lead to is not
; known, but it is thought that they will re-
I sult in a much more liberal administra
tion for the island, if not in its complete
I independence. That there is probably
some foundation for the rumor is indi
cated by the refusal of Senor Canovas to
communicate to the Cortes the diplomatic
correspondence that' has taken place on
. the subject.
Notwithstanding the statements made
by the Spanish authorities that the war in
Cuba is practically over and that there is
! little except guerrilla fighting on the
! island, those who are familiar with the
j situation know that the revolution is very
! far from being suppressed, and tbat the
' borne Government is getting very tired of
; the struggle and would gladly avail itself
of any means of ending the war that
would not involve a confession of defeat. .
The war has been terribly expensive for
Spain, both in the matter of money and
also in life. The loss in the army has
been very heavy, not so much as a result
of conflicts with the insurgents as on ac
count of the climate. The Cuban climate
has been very severe on the unacclimated
soldiers from Europe, who have died by
the thousands. Ever since the war began
the hospitals have been full to overflowing
with Spanish.
The stories of starvation continue to
come from the interior. Thousands of
I people on the island have died of starva
tion and the deaths from this cause will
I be greatly increased before any help can
1 come, ln all parts of the island there is

Tttrple Hacks Vp ths Joint Resolution
Presented by Morgan.
WASHINGTON, D. 'C. May 10.âMor
gan's resolution recognizing belligerency
in Cuba was taken up in the Senate to
day, and Hale addressed the Senate in op
position to it.
Turpie argued in favor of the resolu
tion. He spoke of the universality of
American sympathy with the Cubans,
saying the only question was how far that
sympathy should go. Should it be con
fined to meetings or should there be an
official declaration, asking the Govern
ment to give expression of it, that it be
published and proclaimed throughout the
world. He thought tuis sympathy should
take shape in official action now, to-day.
It ought to be no longer delayed. The
resolution should not be referred to the
Committee on . Foreign Relations, for
that committee was unanimously in favor:
of it, and had reported a similar resolu
tion two months ago, only that was con
current while this was a joint resolu
tion.
Referring to the objections that the
Cuban patriots held no seaport, Turpie
cited many other cases, including the
colonies wherein all the seaports were
! held by the enemy, and said the struggle
I for liberty had not in any age depended
on seaports. It had depended on the
great principle that people who live in a
country are entitled to rule and govern it.
They had the God-given right to dominion
over it. This was tbe ace of revolution,
and he hoped it would last long enough to
drive the last remnant of monarchy from
the American continent.
White of California, a member of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, chal
lenged the correctness of Turpie's state
ment that the committee was unani
mously in favor of the resolution, and he
compared the concurrent resolution re
ported last session with the joint resolu
tion now pending to show the disparity
between them. He thought the usual
course should be followed and the resolu
tion referred to the Cammittee on Foreign
Relations. 'â ''â â tf- â ',''.
Morrill said he would like to talk briefly
on the subject, but preferred to do so to
morrow. On his motion, therefore, tbe
Senate proceeded to executive business
and afterward adjourned.
NICARAGUA EXPEDITION ARRIVES
Now the Honduras Revolutionists Will
Attempt to Stand Off the Lucy B's
Bombardment
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 10.âAd
vices from Puerto Cor ter are to the effect
that the Nicaraguan expedition sent
against the revolutionists, under General
Raines, bad just arrived there in the Lucy
B, carrying two cannon, and was prepar
ing to bombard the town. American resi
dents were very much disturbed at the
situation, and looking impatiently for the
arrival of an American warship. The
revolutionists are determined to make a
stand at Puerto Cortez. They have con- j
centrated their forces there, and an en
gagement between the Lucy B of the
Nicaraguan navy and tho land forces of
the revolutionists was momentarily ex
pected. The revolutionists have destroyed
the railroad bridge trom the interior to
Puerto Cortez, and so prevent an attack
from the Government forces or those of
Salvador marching from the interior.

OF A CANINE HERO
j Carries a Message Eighty
Miles to Relieve a
Settlement.
Through a Dense Forest the
tv ; ; Dog Makes His Way to
Civilization.
Carrying a Massage That Many Are
* Stricken With Smallpox the
Animal Makes a Long Trip.
WATERVILLE, Ms., May 10.â Friday
morning when Landlord Joshua Hilton
of Hiltons, near the Canada line, went to
his front door at an early hour he found &
half-starved dog lying on the piazza. At
tached to the dog's collar was a piece of
oilcloth such as is worn nowadays by
river drivers. This was rolled up and tied
to the leather strap about the dog's neck.
Inside the roll of oilcloth was found a
piece of paper bag crumpled and soiled
on which was rudely printed in ink or
painted the following*.
"Sefen lions is al dying 28 folk is sik
smal pox al sik foloe dog. Jony Wood."
Landlord Hilton stood astounaed, but
soon raised the house and all began to
study out the thing. The dog was not rec
ognized, but the name â evidently that of
"Johnny Wools," a half-breed Indian
was recalled, the owner having visited
Hiltons on several occasions. Mr. Hilton
figured It out that the settlement known
as Seven Islands stricken with small
pox and that Johnny Wood had written
the message and sent the dog out to some
settlement.
A party was at once organized to start
an expedition from Hiltons up the Canada
road into Canada as far north as Ash
burton and then to proceed east to Seven
Islands, in Aroostook County, to relieve
the settlement. The nearest settlement
in Maine is Winterville, in Aroostook
County, sixty-five miles distant. The
next nearest is Seboomook, at the north
ern extremity of Moose Head Lake, and
in Somerset County, seventy miles away.
Ashburton, in Canada, is but forty miles
off, but Hiltons, in Somerset County and
on the "Canada road," so called, is over
eighty miles distant from Seven Islands. .
Around about that section and between
the points mentioned there is nothing but
the virgin forest. The , county is cut up
by the tributaries of the St. John and the
western feeders of the Allagash rivers.
Seven Islands is inhabited by hunters,
gum-gatherers and by people who come
from Canada. It is a place - without a
store, hotel, clergyman or physician. It
would not be at all strange for a case of
smallpox to be there, and the disease
once started, from the condition of things
would spread through the settlement.
OMAHA HAS TWO MAYORS.
Both Conducting Business, but From Dif
ferent Headquarters â Injunctions
ot All Kinds Issued.
OMAHA, Nebb., May 10.â Omaha has
two very active Mayors to-night. Moores
has his headquarters in a private office,
while Broach , is occupying a similar posi
tion in", the; City Hall, supported by the
Fire and Police Commission and li; police
men who patrol the corridors. The city
is running smoothly with its dual govern
ment, while injunctions galore have been
issued by different sections of the District
Court. , , \ ** Â.'.,., .'
. This morning the new Council sent a
communication to Moores recognizing
him. Moores replied that he would send
in his regular message to-morrow night.
The Council then held an animated ses
sion. One member made an effort to go
into ; 1 Mayor . Broach's * office > and was
ejected, whereupon the Moores Council
passed a fiery resolution demanding re
dress of the Police Commission.
Mayor Moores, accompanied by the new
City Attorney, marched to the City Hall
amid the cheers of the crowd and passed
through the line of police to the Mayor's
door. When he thrust an officer who
stood at the door aside and- tried to enter,
he found it locked. A knock brought the
Chief of Police and a dozen officers, who
refused to admit Moores.
After this display of force Moores left,
and finding Broach at his business house
demanded the office, but Broach refused
to surrender. While returning to his pri
vate office Moores was served with an
order from one of the Judges of the
District Court restraining* him from
interfering with Broach., The case; is set
for hearing to-morrow. 1 '" 1 "'
COULO THEY HAVE BEEN SAVED?
Conflicting Stories Concerning .the Burn-
ing Up of the Immigrants in the
Steerage ot the Leona.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 10.â The fore
hold of the Mallory line Leona, in which
thirteen people were suffocated Sunday
morning, was not officially Inspected to
day. Captain Petrie of the United States
Board of Inspectors of Steam Vessels will
probably call the officers of the steamer,
the owners and some of the passengers to
give evidence to-morrow. This evidence
will be of a conflicting nature. v^/'-' â¢
Many passengers made statements to
day reflecting upon the courage of the
crew. Some of them intimated, too, that
if more immediate attention had been
paid to the human beings caught in the
fore hold and less to the general safety
their lives might have been saved. On
the other hand, some of the cabin passen
gers had nothing but praise for the con
duct of Captain Wilder and crew. â¢; The
officers themselves say everything possi
ble was done to save life. W-H'
It is not clear how the fire started.
Statements of agents of the line and
officers make it appear that every pre
caution was taken to prevent any accident
happening to the combustible part of the
cargo. i^ i &?.*?h^' : Â£t i bVr^' \ â ''.
One thing not explained yet is what the
three members of the ship's company,
who were suffocated with ten .steerage
passengers, were doing in that part of the
hold where their bodies were found. This
was near a case of matches, and an iron
lamp box, in the bottom of which was a
large quantity of mineral or sperm oil. . 1
The rooms were formed entirely of
wood, and filled with, small bunts, in
which the passengers slept. Between
them was a wide companion way leading
to the deck. Both rooms, opened beside
the stairs, and any body who gained " the
door would have had little difficulty in
escaping.

WASHINGTON. D. C, May 10.â The
Call correspondent had another inter
view with the supervising architect of the
treasury to-day about the commencement
of work on the San Francisco Postoffice
building. He said:
"The San Francisco people seem to be
very much interested in the matter, for
since Tub Call published its interview
with me on Sunday morning I have re
ceived a number of telegrams from Ssn
Francisco, as well as some visits from
newspapermen. I have not much to add,
but I will be able to give you a more
definite idea as to dates if you wish."
â â  Mr. Aiken then called one of his subor
dinates into the office, who said that the
notice to tenants on the Seventh and Mis
sion, streets lots was dated i May 7, and
was expected to reach San Francisco not
later than May 12. The tenants have
been given thirty days' notice and all of
them are expected to vacate the premises
by June 12. The Collector of Customs has
been instructed to see that they obey this
order. , ..
The advertisements for bids for the
work of removing the buildings on the
lot have already been sent to San Fran
cisco, but will not be published for four
weeks. By the end of that time, or about
June 10, the entire plans for the founda
tion and first story will have been com
pleted, as well as the specifications, and
the advertisements for bids for this work
will run for four weeks, or until about
June 7or 8. The award of contract will

The Marquis is heir to the title and es

toward shuffling off this mortal coil, and
as the . present status of the Marquis
among the court circles is decidedly em
barrassing (to j his \ royal spouse, it is pro
posed to create him a Peer without watt
ing for his succession to his father's title,
so that in state functions he may take the
precedence more properly attaching to the
husband of a Queen's daughter.

ONE MISTAKE
COST GREECE
THE VICTORY.
Edhem Pasha Had Despaired
of Breaking the Lines
of the Enemy.
ALL CHANGED BY THE RETREAT
.*; \ FROM PHARSALA.
That Same Evening the Sultan Sent an
Envoy to Make Overturesâ Now the
Hellenes Are on the Verge y,
of Revolution.
LONDON, ENG., May io. â The Athens correspondent of file
Chronicle claims to have the highest authority for stating that the
retreat to Pharsala arose from one Greek general's mistaking the re
treat of the Turks for a forward movement to turn the Greek flank.
On the evening of April 23, when the retreat occurred, the state of
the Turks was simply pitiful. Edhem Pasha, despairing , of breaking
the Greek lines, had ordered a retreat to Elassona.
The same evening a special envoy left Yildiz Kiosk for Athens,
bearing a letter making overtures for peace at a sacrifice to Turkey.
The letter only arrived yesterday.
LONDON, Esq., May 10.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Athens, sent
shortly beforo midnight, says Greece has
agreed to immediately recall her troops,
to recognize the autonomy of Crete and
to entrust her destinies to the powers, who
will subsequently intervene and stop the
war. .
This Is confirmed by another dispatch
from Athens, which, further, says Ger
many insisted upon the condition that
Greece has now accepted,- implying that
the other powers were willing to make
conditions less rigorous.
The Daily Mail's Berlin dispatch says it
is stated in a telegram received therefrom
Athens that King George has resummoned
Delyannis, late Premier, and the fall of
the Ralli Ministry is probable.
Much comment is excited by the Vienna
Neve Freie Presse'a report to-day of the
conditions under which Turkey signified a
willingness to conclude peace. These are
reported to be the payment by Greece of a
war indemnity of $15,000,000, the acquisi
tion by Turkey of frontier advantages at
Prevesa, Dumasi and Milouna, the abroga
tion of all special .treaties favoring Greek
subjects, and a cession to Turkey of the
Greek ironclad squadron. This is dis
counted, however, by a dispatch to-night
to the Daily Telegraph from Vienna say
ing the Neve Freie Presse statement is de
clared in official circles entirely incorrect.
The Daily Mail correspondent, who to
day rode from Arta to Patras, says that
questions asked of villagers along the
route,; not so much respecting the war
but what would follow, brought forth an
swers which, in the majority of cases,
showed the opinions to be revolutionary,
giving the impression that every thins
was ripe for a serious political revolt. He
adds that there are a large number of
troops at Caravassara, Agrinum and else
where awaiting equipment, besides 2000
volunteers who joined under the auspices
of the National Society. Finally, the well
armed peasantry are thoroughly discon
tented. So, if the National Society desires
to take advantage ot the nation's mis
fortune there could hardly be a better
chance.
m
CONST ANTIN A COWARD.
English Correspondents Tell How
He Suppressed the News of
His Faulty Leadership.
LONDON, Eng., May 10.â The corre
spondent of the Daily Mail, now at Volo,
sends a scathing denunciation of Crown
Prince Constantino. - He says from the
opening of the war the Crown Prince, in
his capacity as censor-in-chief, has blocked
all news sent by 'English reporters^ This
led to their mailing their reports to
Athens.' Even then they were not always
forwarded. The Minister. of War, the
correspondent adds, issues every evening
an official account of the day's events and
this is incorporated in telegrams, which
explains their inaccuracy. Tne cor
respondent says the Crown Prince, who is
perfectly acquainted with the English
language, altered news dispatches so they
would read favorably to himself. ' The
Greek disaster was due chiefly to the
Crown Prince. He is ! answerable' for de
stroying the morale of the army. VBy
giving an order to evacuate Gritzovali the
place was lost. He ordered a retreat from
Turnavo * and ran away y from Larissa,
abandoning the panic-stricken populace,
who believed the city would be defended.
Ail cursed the Crown Prince for deserting
them. Tl^. .â¢â â 
The writer further declares the disaster
was due to a lack of discipline and scarcity
of officers. j; Seven hundred cavalrymen
composed of the gilded youth of Athens
reached Turnavo on the 'fifth day, of the
war, but ; did 1 not find , a 1 single horse?
Greece hoped to mobilize 80,000 ' troops,
but she actually mobilized only half that
number. ;. Then everything was â  wanting,
except ammunition. ' Owing to the fact
that there was no control over the rations
PRICE ; FIVE . CENTS.
the troops were without food two aayi
previous to the evacuation of Larissa.
Other dispatches, including one to the
Morning Post, concur without mention
ing the Crown Prince regarding the bad
management of the campaign. These
dispatches declare the forces were not or
ganized and the officers were untrained. It
is stated that when the civic authorities
of Volo asked the military commandant
what to do when the Turks came, lie re
plied : "Do what you like. Does it concern
me?"- * ',â *.*â  â â â¢:â â .â -â¢* r.r.
'Jy On the other hand there is nothing bot
praise for General Smolenski, who, like
the army, seems to have been a victim of
the bad system and negligence of the
Government at Athens. . '
The majority of the newspapers
chronicle the fact witbout comment. The
organs of ex-Premier Delyannis attack
the Government, and urge that a stronger
defense be made. ; \';^
BLUNDERS IN EPIRUS.
Unsupported Evzones Compelled
to Fall Back and Join the
Mad ' Retreat to Arta.
LONDON, Esq., May There had
been no intelligent account of the collapse
of the GreeK campaign in Epirus and the
ignominious retreat of the Greeks to Arta
until the receipt to-day of the vivid descrip
tion published by the Manchester Guardian
by Allen Upward, the novelist, who has
been a volunteer on the Greek side since
the outbreak of the war. During the first
day's campaign the Greeks achieved bril
liant tuccesses, the Turks retiring every
where before their advance. Phlllipiada
was taken easily, and then came the first
Greek repulse at Pentepigadia. Upward s
account of what followed must be accepted
as possibly correct, for he is a strong Greco
phile. He says the Turkish force was
gradually strengthened, while on the Greek
side the force consisted of a regiment of
Evzones or highlanders of Greece with a
couple of guns. There were other bodies
of troops along the road at various dis
tances.in the rear, but no attempt was
made to bring them to the support of the
Evzones.
All day Wednesday, April 21, the fire
between the outposts at Pentepigadia
grew in fierceness, but Turkish fire grad
ually got to be the stronger. During all
tbis time the Evzones were left to repre
sent the Greek army. The Turks on
Thursday discovered the smallness of the
enemy's force, and after a strong fusillade
began to advance on all sides, enveloping
the Evzones, who, knowing they were not
supported, gave nay when the red fezzes
appeared on. the crest of the hill. The
Greeks retired down the mountain side.
Accounts of the retreat differ, but the
best of the report is that, while the
Evzones stood out bravely in the entrench
ments against the Turkish fusillade, the
instant they saw the Turks move for
ward they broke. Certainly nobody else
made any stand. The infantry down the
road, who had not even seen the enemy,
fled in panic , the instant they perceived
the Evzones retiring. The panic commu
nicated itself right down the line, and in
a few hours the whole army was in full re
treat to Arta. '*.
Instead of trying to retrieve the situa
tion and reassure the troops, it is al
leged that Colonel Manos, the Greek com
mander, himself ordered some of them to
come on with the rest of the army. Thus
between the panic of the men themselves
ann the orders of their superiors the whole
force which had crossed the bridge at
Arta with such high hopes , a week before
came streaming back from the first dark
ness of night to early dawn to the place
they held when the war began.
Â Not alone was it the army which poured
into' the town. Throughout the entire
countryside the melancholy news that the
Greek army was on the run spread with
incredible ; rapidity. Everywhere homes
were deserted, mules and ponies laden
with sacks of meal, bedding and every
thing that could; be carried, and a start
made for Arta. The road became choked,
and swarms of fugitives mixed with the
retreating troops in hopeless confusion.
Mr. Upward adds:
. "I saw old women staggering along
bent almost doable under : their heavy2
burdens, jostling with the animals as tbey
crowded toward the narrow bridge. At
dawn the dreary procession was still on
the way. I saw the bridge choked with
the rout. The scene in the streets of Arta
was equally miserable. The shops all
closed with one accord ana the inhabi
tants gathered in angry groups expecting
to hear the thunder of the guns of the ad
vancing Turkish army. A rumor arose
that Colonel Manos was about to quit the
town. A deputation warned him he
would not be allowed to leave without
molestation. The troops were then in a
state of utter disorder. They were angry
with themselves and their commander,
and it seemed as though they .would
mutiny at any moment. One soldier of
good position, speaking to me in English,
said: 'The next thing we will be fighting
each other. The war with Turkey is over
as far as wa are concerned. We no longer
consider the Saltan our enemy, bat
rather our own King.'
"Since the bad news was received from
Thessaly and the fall of the Governmen t
at Athens this feeling has become uni
versal. , The Turks, if they had chosen,
might have marched into Arta Friday
mornine. I didn't see a sentry on the
bridge on duty. Trenches were unoccu
pied and nobody was making even a show
of defending the town.'
The condition of the collapse as de
tailed by Mr. Upward continues to-day.
Shops in Arta are being reopened, but the
inhabitants completely mistrust the
Greek leaders. Colonel S:ratos, Manos'
successor, immediately countermanded
the latter's orders for the movement
against Prevesa. Now Stratos himself is
being hemmed in at Arta. It was stated
Vassos was to have been given the com
mand of the trooDS at Arta, but it is too
late to revive the morale of the troops and
save the Epirus campaign, which, de
spite the early promise, is now as hope
less as the campaign in Thessaly.
PRIm\CESS BEATRICE'S BEAZTB.
Bill >ot Allow Ber to Participate in the
Jubilee Festivities.
LONDON, Exg., May 10.â The reports
that have been current in court circles for
some months concerning the precarious
health of the widowed Princess Henry of
Battenberg, better known as the Princess
Beatrice, favorite daughter ana companion
of the Queen, find a strong indorsement
tbrougn tbe announcement in the court
circular that sho will not participate in
the jubilee festivities. : V
She will go to Germany in a few weeks,
there to remain until July. Officially it
is stated that this step on the part of
the Princess is due to the fact that she is
still in mourning for her husband, but
the latter has been dead considerably over
a year, and both the court in general and
the Princess in particular have been out
of mourning since the memorial anniver
sary on the Isle of Wight some months
since.
The real facts are understood to be that
the Princess is in no physical condition
to stand the strain that constant attend
ance on her mother, the Queen, during
the jubilee period would involve, and that
consequently, in order that no sensation
might be produced by her experiencing
fainting or collapsing spells in public, it
has been thought best that she. should
leave the country and spend t c jubilee
period in quiet with the court of Germany.
BOMORS TO BISMARCK.
Admirers Bold a Torchlight Procession
at Friedrichsruhe.
BERLIN, Germany. May 10.â The Ham
burg friends or Prince, Bismarck and a
number of bis friends and admirers from
other places held a torchlight procession
in his honor at Friedrichsruhe tc-night,
the anniversary of the peace of Frankfort.
Three thousand participated in the pro
cession. The weather was not propitious,
there being a heavy rain.
The Prince, who seemed to be enjoying
good health, witnessed the procession
standing on a balcony. Later an aduress
was presented to him. In reply he said
that he had most agreeable recollections
of those connected with tbe conclusion of
peace in 1871. He added that this Mon
day was the fiftieth anniversary of his
entrance into parliamentary lite. Since
then, he said, he had experienced much
Jove and hatred. Tne advantage of grow
ing old was that one became Callous to
hatred, insult and calumny, while one's
capacity lor love and good-will grew
greater. \ â  'â. :':i-y

MAP ILLUSTRATING EDHEM PASHA'S ADVANCE UPON DHOMOKO.
Vrysia, which the advance division of the Turkish army has already occupied, is a small town just half-way between Pharsaia and Dhomoko, being two hours' ride
or eight miles from either place. It is reached by two roads from Pharsaia, one the main road over the hills and the other along the edge of the plain which ey over
look. The first, leaving Phar?ala by the southwest, winds up the hill past the Gougava Springs, through the pass between the Skia and Alogopati ridges, and thence
down the plain. The other runs west to Tchasmat and thence south through the open country. Vrysia does not lie directly upon either road, but a short distance, three
quarters of a mile to the left, at the eastern extremity of a salt marsh which extends into the mountains and which is, crossed by both roads on causeways. These roads
continue south, neatly parallel to each other, to Dhomoko, the last two miles being up through the narrow ravines of the Dhomoliotikas River. Three other roads leave
the plain at Bazaraki, two of which lead into Dhomoko, one by the hills and the other, for the greater part of its course, on the plain. The third, which is a good car
riage-road, follows the windings of the Sophadhiiikas River around the southern side of the Palaimonastiro Mountains to Lake Omvriak, where it forks. One branch,
going directly south, crosses the Orthrys Mountains by Makhlauka Pass, and the other, turning south at the eastern end of the lake, crosses the mountains a little to the
west of the main road from Dhomoko through Phaueka Pass. East of the main road is another, not practicable for vehicles, running from Pharsaia to the left of the
Alagopati ridge to Rizi, thence over the Khassidiari Mountains to Karatsali and on a couple of miles east of Dliomoko to the main road just before it enters Phaueka
Pass. With all these routes to their front, one on each flank to their rear, even though they come very near together just below Dhomoko, Edhem Pasha, with his su- #
perior forces, will doubtless be aDle to force the Greek army from their present position without a heavy fight or assaulting their strong works.
JAPAN'S ATTITUDE
TOWARD HAWAII
Will Seek Damages for
Rejection of Its
Emigrants.
Commission on the Way to
the Islands to Make the
Demand.
China Also Has a Grievance-Small
pox Succeeded by Diphtheria
at Honolulu.
' HONOLULU, Hawaii. May 4.â The Pa
cific Mail steamship China errived from
Yokohama at 7 a. m. yesterday, but saw
nothing of the Japanese cruiser Naniwa on
the way. That war-vessel left Yokohama
at 1 p. M. on April 20, according to dis
patches received by the Hawaiian Govern
ment, just four days previous to the sailing
of the China. On board the Naniwa is
Councilor Akiyama of the Japanese For*
eign Office and two special newspaper
correspondents. The vessel also brings
three of the rejected Japanese emigrants,
whose presence is claimed to be necessary,
as they are to give evidence in the pro
posed investigation to be conducted by
the Japanese commission, j The Japanese
newspapers are full of comments on the
rejection of tbe emigrants, and seem to
anticipate trouble with the United States
over the action of Hawaii.
The Japan Times says of tie situation:
Nothing would be more regreta than to
see the matter transformed into a serious di
plomatic complication between this country
and the United Stalesâ contingency which
is not by any means impossible, and which we
leer is exactly what some politicians in Ha
waii are most desirous of bringing about.
Japan will not flinch from meeting manfully
any turn the question may assume, but it
would be extremely deplorable should circum
stances force any serious rupture with a na
tion to which we owe so much in our past
efforts to advance along the path of the new
civilization.
The Japan Mall has the following con
cerning the amount of damages ' likely to
be claimed by Japan from Hawaii:
It is said that the emigration company of
Kobe claims 320.60 yen for every man turned
back. l The sum of 320.60 yen is to cover all
the expenses Incurred by the emigrant on ac
count of travel. outfit, etc. It sounds like
a good deal. The Kobe company had 313 emi
grants returned, so that its total demand
amounts to 97,893.10 yen.
According to the native Japanese press
Councilor Akiyama is expected to con
clude his mis-don and return home in
about three months. They publish the fol
lowing as tbe instructions given by Count
Okuma, Minister of State for Foreign Af
fairs, to the Japanese Minister in Hono
lulu: " : *
â 1. The Hawaiian Government, in refusing
to permit Japanese emigrants to land, put it
out of the power of the Japanese Consul to
adopt measures for their protection and to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAT 11, 1897.
discharge other necessary functions. Its action
must be regarded as contrary to the treaty.
2. The measure taken by the Hawaiian Gov
ernment to prevent the Japanese emigrants
from placing the matter in the hands of legal
advisers amounted practically to undue inter
ference with individual rights of the Japanese,
and must also be a violation of the treaty.
3. The fact that the Hawaiian Judiciary, in
I conformity with the position taken by the
! executive, refused to entertain the suit at
j law instituted by the Japanese whose landing
i had been prevented, must be regarded as a
violation of the legal rights secured to the
! Japanese by the treaty. ,- : . v ;"
Contrary to all [expectations the China
brought 256 Japanese to tbis port. They
are all contract laborers and no trouble is
anticipated in landing them, the Pacific
Mail officials having seen that their papers
were all regular before giving them pas
sage.
It is said that troubles never come
singly, and the Hawaiian Government is
certainly having its share of them now.
On top of the Japanese immigration mat
ters Chinese Consul-General and Diplo
matic Agent Goo Kirn Fuey has served
notice on the Hawaiian Government that
he wants an official investigation made of
the recent labor troubles among the Chi
nese at Lihue plantation, on the island of
Kaui. It will be remembered tha: about
fifty Chinese contract laborers made an
assault on one of the lunas or overseers
and upon his calling other lunas to his
assistance a free fight ensued.
During the melee one of the lunas
named Wolters fired several shots, at first
into the ground and afterward into the
crowd. One Chinaman was shot and died
a day or two afterward. The Coroner's
jury exonerated the luna, of course, but
the Chinese Consul is not satisfied with
the way things were managed at the in
quest. ' He sent over a special attorney to
watch the proceedings for the Chinese
Government, and now follows his demand
for an investigation.
-There have been no additional cases of
smallpox among tbe Japanese at tbe quar
antine station since the last mail, and it is
thought all danger of a further outbreak
is over. . But Honolulu is now fighting a
fresh and more insidious disease in the
shape of diphtheria, of which there have
been no less than four cases in the past
ten days in four different parts of the
city. Two of these were reported to the
Board of Health on Saturday afternoon,
and a special meeting was held- for the
purpose of taking action.
It has always been claimed that a case
of diphtheria was unknown in Honolulu,
but there appears to bo no doubt of these
cases. The first child died under an opet
atlon, being brought- to the physician In
the last stages of the * disease. Tnat phy
sician instantly called another, and it was
decided that tracheotomy mu3t be per
formed at once, but tbe child died as the
tube was being. inserted in its throat. In
this esse and the three others bacteriolog
ical cultures were made from the mem
brane of the throat and the bacilli of diph
theria found beyond a doubt.' It is sup
posed that the disease must -have been
brought here from San Francisco recently.
Just at present there is an epidemic of
sore throats here and the Board of Health
is very much worried over tbe outlook. A
meeting of all the physicians in the city
has been called for to-day, and all physi
cians and school teachers are required to
instantly notify the board of all cases of
suspicious sore throat which may come
under their observation. Quarantine
measures so far have been left to the dis
cretion of the attending physicians and
tbe executive officers of the board. For
the past month the trade winds have been
blowing very strongly, accompanied by
extremely light showers or squalls, but
the total rainfall .in *, the City for the
month has not equaled three-fourths of an
inch. To this peculiar, weather the doc
tors ascribe tbe sore throat epidemic.
Dr. Eidredge, sanitary inspector for tbe
Hawaiian Government at Yokohama, re
ports that the smallpox epidemic in Japan
is about over. For the two weeks previous
to the departure of the China there were
only eight cases in Yokohama with two
deaths. On this showing and the posi
tive assurance from the China's doctor
that there had been no sickness of any
kind on the voyage, tbe China's cabin
passengers were allowed to land here yes
terday and spent the day taking in the
sights. The steerage passengers were
sent to Quarantine Island to complete
the period of eighteen days' quarantine
from the date of leaving Yokohama.
Mrs. Julia Waterbouse, wife of Senator
Henry Waterhouse, died suoden.y at

A GREAT XAIUR BASIN.
Site selected for the Government Reservoir
in Wyoming.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., May Xo.âLieuten
ant Chittenden, the Government engineer
detailed to choose a site for the proposed
Government reservoir in Colorado and
Wyoming, has selected the great natural
basin near Laramie as the ; Wyoming
site. This ".. basin is in "j the : heart ;of the
Rocky Mountains, and is ten miles long
by two wide. -Its maximum depth is 150
feet, and the Government engineer esti
mates that it will hold 20.000,000.000 cubic
feet of r water. The walls of the basin are
without a break and the bottom is of rock
Imperyious to water. The Big "Una Little
Laramie Rivers will be tapped, and it will
take between five and six years to fill the
basin. Water can be stored to keep the
entire eastern part of Wyoming and

VICOTRY FOR THE
BELL COMAPANY
Stubbornly Fought Case
Decided by Justice
Brewer.
Court of \ Appeals Sustained
in Its Berliner Patent
Ruling. \
Suit for Cancellation Was Begun
by the Government Five
Years Ago.
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 10.â The
Berliner patent lor the telephone trans
mitter, which now controls the telephone
business, and is owned by the American
Bell Telephone Company, was broadly
sustained in the Supreme Court to-day.
Justice Brewer announcing the opinion.
Berliner died his application in the
Patent Office in 1877, after which the Bell
Company obtained possession. The patent
was not issued until 1891. The original
Bell patent expired in 1893, and the issue
of the Berliner patent practically extended
the monopoly of the Bell Company until
1908. V
Suit was begun by the Attorney-Gen
eral of the United States in 1892, in the
Circuit Court at Boston, to cancel the pa
tent, and a decree was made for the Gov
ernment in that court. On appeal by the
company the Court â¢of Anneals for the
first circuit reversed the Circuit Court and
sustained the patent. Thence the Gov
ernment brought the case on certiorari
to the Supreme Court.
Judge Brewer in his opinion said that
the Government based its suit for cancel
lation upon the ground that the delay of
thirteen years in the issue of the patent
was under conditions unlawful and fraud
ulent ; that the claims for the patent were
covered by the patent previously issued
to Berliner in 1880; that the patent issued
was not for the invention described in the
application, and that the invention for
which the patent was issued was barred
by previous public use for more tban two
years. In a suit of this kind, said Brewer,
as in a suit to cancel a land patent, the
Government must establish its grounds
by clear and satisfactory evidence. Upon
the record submitted in the case the court
held: . . ,T.'-' '
1. There was no evidence of any corruption
or undue influence used by Patent Office of
ficials or employes to hinder or delay consid
eration of the Berliner application or issue a
patent thereon.
2. There was no testimony to show that the
delay complained of was at the instance or
procurement of the telephone company or any
of us officials. -v\;
3. Whatever delay -lid occur was caused by
the officials of tne Patent Office, and the of
ficers oi the telephone company were In no
wise responsible. The judgment of the Court
of Appeals is therefore affirmed.
Justices Gray and Brown took no part
in the decision. Justice Harlan dis
sented.

HIS WEAKNESS.
Every man is supposed â '
to have a weakness, or
you may say a leaning,
toward some particular
endeavor in life. Some
men like music, others
books, etc. Then again
there are men who are,
Eof a convivial nature, <
men who always wish to
be with the boys and
to do as the boys do.
These men soon grow
old, because they dissipate,
they abuse their young
lives in early manhood,
and doing so sow seeds
of dissipation that ends
in the whirlwind of debility , 'â 
and disease. Such a
â man applied to the Hudson
doctors for their great
Hudyan remedy-treatment.
He used the treatment
exactly as the doctors
advised him, and in the
â  course of a few months
he was entirely renewed.
Of course, if he again * :
began his recklessness
he would soon glide
into the same condition.
But he was a wise man.
. He knew he was cured
and' wanted to stay
cured. This man has
written a testimonial â¢

IS SAFELY CAGED
Capture of the Leader
of a Gang of West
ern Outlaws.
Wounded by a Deputy Mar
shal He Is Finally Tracked
to His Lair.
This Clever Stroke of the Officers
Breaks Up His Band of
Cutthroats.
WICHITA, Kaks., May 10.â A dispatch
from Newkirk (L T.) says: The Newcomb
band of outlaws has been completely
broken up, the capture of Ed Newcomb,
the leader, putting an end to the organiza
tion. Deputy United States Marshal P. I.
Brown arrived in the city last night hav
ing in charge a bunch of United States
prisoners, and related the facts connected
with the capture of Newcomb. Deputy
Brown, in company with Deputy Lead
better, had been scouring the Indian coun
try for two weeks in search of the New
comb gang. The officers became sepa
rated upon reaching a stream, Brown
searching the timber on one side of the
river, while Leadbetter performed a like
service upon the other side.
Brown was on foot, leading his horse,
when, at a turn in the road, he came face
to face with the notorious outlaw, Ed
Newcomb. Tbe outlaw's Winchester im
mediately went to his shoulder, but be
fore he could fire Brown sprang behind a
tree and the outlaw immediately followed
the example and sought safety behind a
tree.
The officer and the outlaw, each using a
tree for breastworks, began firing at each
other when either would expose himself
the least bit. One bullet passed through
the crown of the officer's hat, while sev-
eral times the bullets cut the tree so close
to his head that the flying particles of bark
would strike him in the face. The tree
behind which the outlaw sought shelter
was not as large as the one that protected
the officer, and the outlaw fully realizing
this fact darted away through the thick
underbrush and mounting his norse took
to the hills.
Next morning both officers, confident
that the outlaws were in hiding some
where in the vicinity, began a careful
search, each taking a different direction.
Deputy Leadbetter had not gone far when
he met a physician, who informed him
that he had been hastily summoned to at
tend a man who had been shot the night
before. Leadbetter, surmising that the
wounded man was Ed Newcomb, followed
the physician at a safe distance, and a
ride of a few miles brought them to a
cabin in a heavy bunch of timber under
the bluffs near the river bank.
Dismounting and leaving his horse in
the bushes, the officer crawled cautiously
to tbe cabin door and entered suddenly
with a cocked revolver in each hand. He
covered the surprised inmates with his
puns and beheld Newcomb lying upon a
bed in a corner of the room. The officer
having tbe drop on ail present there was
no resistance, and in a short time he had
his man loaded in a wagon and on his way
to the United States prison.
The arrest of Newcomb virtually breaks
up the last of the organized band of rob
bers that have terrorized the Indian Ter
ritory. Newcomb is an old band at the
business, having trained with the Dal
tons, the Cooks, Cherokee Bill, Slaughter
Kid, Dynamite Dick, Bill Dooiin and
like gentry of six-shooter fame, but has
always heretofore managed to elude the
officers. A few months ago he organized
a band consisting mostly of young half
breeds, the majority of whom are now be
hind prison-bars, and began a system of
robbery that was terrorizing the country,
but with the arrest of Ed Newcomb the
last one of the old original train and bank
robbers passes off the scene of action, and
law and order will reign supreme until
another Richmond takes the field.

DENVER SMITH FIGHTS FOUL.
Butts a Tooth From Choynski's Mouth and
Is Promptly Disqualified by the
Referee.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 10.â "Denver"
Ed Smith was disqualified in the fourth
round by Referee Roche at the Broadway
Athletic Club to-night for hutting Joe
Choynski in the mouth. Joe lost a tooth
i hereby, but won the purse money, about
$3000, and the admiration of the spectators
for his clever and clean maneuvering.
From his appearance when he was
stopped Smith's adherents were not filled
with the confidence which was held by
the admirers of ChoynskL The Denver
man was flabby and seemed in need of
several weeks' more training, although he
assured everybody who questioned him
that he had never stepped into a ring
more lit.
Profiting by experience in his fight with
Maher, Choynski, realizing that ne bad a
slugver pure and simple to deal witb, de
cided to tight Smith at lone range, thereby
permitting himself to wait for an opening
for a final punch. Joo quickly convinced
the3oCo spectators that he was Smith's
cluster in science, ring tactics and general
knowledge of pugilism. The Denver fight
er's methods from the very outset were
limited to dangerous swines with his
right for the jaw and hook blows at close
quarters with his left.
Choynski, with good judgment and
most skillful control of his nands, avoided
nearly all of Smith's blows or broke their
force so that they were practically harm
less, and then, when openings came, he
deftly shot his gloved fists to vital spots
until ' Denver" Smith was covered with
blood and a good imitation of a punching
bag. . _ -â¢" :
The referee's decision came when he
was convinced that it was Smith's intent
to violate the Queensberry rules, and his
ruling was received with universal com
mendation, cheers for Choynski ami hoots
and hisses for Smith until he disappeared
in the dressing-room.
When Choynski left the ring "Parson"
Davies. his manager, declared* that be
would back him for $5000 against Fitz
simrnons in a limited-round bout or to a
finish, the winner to tafee all. Davies has
already posted $100J with Al Smith to
bind this match, and says he will put up
$4000 more inside of forty-eight hours if
Fitzsimrnons will accept the challege.
The betting was in Choynski's favor
about 100 to 60. The Caltforninn had
trained faithfully at Newdorp, S. 1., in
company with Sharkey, and when he
came to the clubhouse his condition was
well-nigh perfect.
When Corbett, accompanied by Al
Smith, appeared there was a hearty
round of applause. Corbett, togged in
the height of fashion, bowed in response
ana took a seat close to the ring.

BANDITS WORSTED
BY A NERVY YOUTH
Bold Attack Upon Two
Masked Robbers at
Nevada City.
Walter Kavanagh Prevents the
Looting of the Union
* Hotel Safe.
Unarmed and Alone ** Ha Assails
the Intruders and Drives
Them Off.
NEVADA CIIY, Cal., May 10.â Walter
Kavanaugh.a 20-year-old youth, is the hero
of the hour in Nevada City. Unarmed and
alone he engaged in combat with two
masked bandits who were robbing the safe
in the Union Hotel early this morning,
and drove the pair from the place. He
was the target for a volley of bullets, but
held his ground and . escaped from I the
fray unscathed, after preventing the loss
of nearly $1000, which the robbers had
taken from the safe. : * *
Two men wearing linen dusters and
masks entered the office of the hotel at
3:30 o'clock this morning through the
washroom, to which apartment they had
gained entrance from the rear of the build
ing. Walter Kavanaugh, the night clerk,
was alone in tbe office. One of the intru
ders covered him with a revolver and or
dered him to give up the valuables.
K'ivanaugh handed over his watch and
$70 in money.
The men then searched in the drawers
and lockers back of the counter for the
keys to the safe and the money drawer,
and succeeded in rinding the .keys, but
could not pick out the right ones. They
ordered the night clerk to open the safe
and take out the money. â¢ While Kavan
augh was thus engaged one of the robbers
stepped around in front of the counter
and kept him covered with a pistol. The
robbers in the meantime bad turned off
the lights and locked the front door.
The first thing taken from the safe was
a bag . containing money belonging to
sporting men. Into this bag was put the
watch and $70 taken from Kavanagh.
Next came the cash drawer. Just as Kava
nagh removed this from the safe he noticed
that one of the men had his head partly
turned, and, raising the drawer, he threw
it with all of its contents into tie robber's
face. The blow staggered the outlaw and
Kavanagh seized his revolver, which was
lying under a newspaper about a foot
from the safe, and began firing at the man
in front of him. After the first shot Kava
nagh dropped to his knee back of the
counter, but continued shooting.
The shots aroused the people in the sec
ond story, and J. Northway, proprietor of
the hotel, came hurrying down the stairs.
Hearing the people coming from the floor
above, and fearing capture, the two
masked men fled, going out by the same
route by which they had entered.
As one of the men reached the door of
the washroom he turned and fired four
shots at the night clerk, all of which
passed in close proximity to Kavanagh's
head and lodged in the wall.
The only thing carried away by the rob
bers was a revolver. â¢ _ here was over $950

â  Young Kavanagh is scarcely of age, is
short of stature and weighs about 120
pounds. By tbis morning's eallant act be
has put himself on record as one of the
nerviest fighters in the mountains.
Within haif an hour after the bandits
bad beaten a precipitate retreat Sheriff
Getcheil and Night Watchman Russell
had been notified of the occurrence and
were on the scene with the county blood
hound "Jim Budd." . ; "i;p
In the alley in the rear of the hotel was
found a heavy dark coat, castaway by one
of the robbers, and tbe masks they had i
worn. The bloodhound was given a sniff !
at these articles and took up tbe trail. He
led the officers along High street in the j
rear of the gasworks, across the fill-in in
front of the Carbolic church, then out Coy- i
ote street into the Manzanita hydraulic
diggings. An occasional track seen here 1
and there showed there weie two of the
fugitives and that they were afoot.
"Jim" followed th.m steadily through I
the claim along the ravine and out under |
the South Yuba Company's flume to tbe j
Blue Tent road, along which he traced
them north for a mile. Finally the trail j
turned and the doc started back toward J
tbe city. Sheriff Getcheil believes the I
robbers live here and that they are now in I
hiding within the city.

GIRLS MAKE WAR
ON A CORPORATION

Demolition of Houses
and Fences in
Larkspur.
Two Sisters Employ Men to
Clear a Highway of
Obstructions.
Claim the American Land and Trust

j
BAN RAFAEL, Cal., May 10.â There
ha ye been exciting scenes at Larkspur to
day. Houses and fences have been torn
down by force and the work of demolition
would have been complete had not bneriff
Henry Harrison stepped in at an oppor
tune moment and stopped the destruc
tion.
Two sisters, Belle C. Brown and Mary
A. Brown, the former being a teacher in
the public school at San Rafael, own
property in Larkspur which has become
known as Brown's camp grounds. During
the summer months they lease it to vari
ous camping parties. To reach the
grounds one must travel a distance of
naif a mile through Larkspur and over
the property of the American Land and |
Trust Company. The president of the
company, G. W, Wright, caused a fence j
to be erected across the road leading to }
Brown's camp grounds. The girls j
chopped the fence down last week.
Wright had a house built a few days ago, j
and the Brown girls threatened to have it j
torn down, claiming that it was on the
road leading to their place and was an
obstruction.
This morning Marshal John E. Creed of
Sausalito, with a party of five, drove to
the Brown camp and without delay be
gan the work of removing the house and
demolishing the fence. Of the latter
about 200 yards of bart-ed wire was cut j
into small bits and the posts dug up and j
splintered. The bouse was raised and j
moved a distance of thirty feet off tbe dis- j
puted road and onto property belonging j
to Wright. . j
Creed and his men worked quickly. i
Only one man interfered. He was an em- j
ploye of Wright by the name of Tim j
Murphy. Descending on Creed and his
five Sausalito workmen with a huge club, .
he ordered the Marsnal to stop, but Creed .
drew a pistol and told Murphy that he i
had better go about his business. When
Murphy caught s ght of the weapon he j
arrived at the same conclusion, and when !
last heard from he had visited a house j
some distance away to ask for a drop of i
wine to steady his nerves.
When Creed and his men finished their i
task the Brown sisters had a fine repast j
ready for tnem and wine flowed ireely.
Then Sheriff Henry Harrison descended !
upon the scene and served injunction pa- \
pers, which had been sworn out in the Su- j
perior Court.
More trouble is expected. President !
Wright of the land company claims he is j
in the right and that he is privileged to j
build a bouse or a fence where he did.
In the Superior Court tbis morning >
Belle C. Brown ana Mary A. Brown filed j
a complaint for an injunction against tlie
American Land and Trust Comcany and ;
William Wright, restraining the defend- j
ant corporation from obstructing the road ;
leading to the Brown Camp Tract. The j
plaintiffs allege that they have enjoyed a i
right of way from Larkspur to their camp |
and that they are now informed that the ]
company intend to erect a house and fences i
so as to prevent the use of the road, to the
injury of the Browns. Judge Angelotti j
issued the injunction, which was served '
late this afternoon on President Wright of j
the land company.
President Wright said this evening:
'â¢Of course we will fight this matter, j
These women are simply attempting to
steal our property. Only last week they j
assaulted me. They flew at me and tore |
my clothes and broke my watch.''
Mr. Wright here produced his time- i
piece, which bad been battered to such a
degree that the lid refused to stay j
closed.
"They also called . me various names,"
he continued, ''and I had a bard time
with them. They have no right to come .
on our property or have men come on our
property to remove any house or tear !
down any fence. We don't intend that
they shall -teal the property, and we will |
fight the case to the end and claim dam- 1
ages for property that has been de- j
stroyed."
The Brown girls tell a different story, j
They are well known in the county and |
are popular in Larkspur, where they have j
lived for some time. They say that the |
roads aye sixty feet in width, but that j
li. W. Wright and the land company j
have only a 30-foot road near their camp, j
The trouble has but commenced, and it j
has become a battle royal between two
girls against a big corporation. Public I
sympathy is against the latter, and the j
outcome of the affair promises to be sen
sational. *
KOON FOR ARIZ OS A MURDERERS.
Fifteen Who Escape the Gallows lie-
caute of a Fault,/ Law.
PHOENIX Ariz., May 10.â After a more
careful canvas of the situation by the
territorial authorities it appears now that
there are fifteen murderers in various
parts of Arizona who will. in .all proba
bility escape the death penalty because
lhe last Legislature, in revoking the old
murder law and enacting a new one,
tailed to provide for the pending cases.
Df these fifteen the one that probably de
ierve-i hanging roost is Augustine Chacon,
who has just been convicted of the mur

Graham County.
Chacon was the leader of a small band
of notorious Mexican cutthroats. This
band broke into Becker's store at
Morenci and while rifling the money
drawer were surprised by the proprietor.
Chacon stabbed Becker almost mortally
and men escaped. During tbe chase by
a Sheriff's posse Chacon shot the man for
whose murder he has been convicted from
behind a sheltering rock. â¢ * ;â â 
'â  His case has been pending a long while
and he seemed to have powerful friends.
Although tried and convicted once under
the law as it stood before the Legislature
met, the best legal authorities in the
Territory are now of the opinion that he
can not be legally executed.
FAMOUS ARIZONA SUIT.
Ntw , Trial of the Government's Action
Against the Copper Queen
Company.
PHCENIX, Ariz., May 10. â United
States Attorney Eilinwood has received
instructions from- the Department of
Justice to retry the cas? of the United
States against the Copper Queen Company
for $133,000, which is claimed by the
Federal Government for timber cut from
Government lands.
This case is the most important in the
history of Arizona jurisprudence. It has
dragged along in the Federal courts of
the Territory for years. Last fall it was On
trial in Tucson before a jury for two weeks
and resulted in a disagreement. About
seventy-five witnesses were examined and
several days were consumed in agument.
The timber for the value of which the
Government sues was cut In Chiracabna
mountains, about forty miles from Bis
bee, where ii was utilized by the mining
company. The of the timber having
been cut is not the point in dispute, the
question hinging almost entirely upon
whether the land from which the Umber
was taken was mineral land or otherwise.
The lecalHiuestions involved are of such
importance that the Attorney-General of
the United States has applied to the In*
terior Department for the assistance of the
director of the Geological Survey, to
determine the nature of the lands in
question. The survey party in charge of
a skilled expert, will be forthwith dis
patched from Washington to the Chira
cahuas, to settle the question scientifi
cally. It the surveyor is a tenderfoot, his
thoughts and anticipations, and possibly
his realizations are not to be envied dur
ing the .coming few weeks, for the scene
of his investigations is in the heart of
the marauding Apache country. Â» S-
The United States Attorney's office is
already at work on the preliminary papers
to be hied in the case, and the trial is ex
pected to be had eurlynn the November
term. It is scarcely probable that United
States Attorney E.'hnwood will still be
representing the Government at that
time, though there is some expectancy
that the reopening of .his case will result
in bis retention in office until the case is
concluded. JK
NO HOPE FOR THE SAMARIA.
Body of One of the Missing Vessel's
Seamen Sighted Off Cape
Flattery.
VICTORIA, B. a, May 10. â Captain
Nikells of the ship British Yeoman is
witness to the fact that some if not all of
the crew of the lost Samaria have been
drowned. On Friday night last, while off
Cape Flattery, he passed through a quan
tity of the Samaria's wreckage and soon
afterward saw the naked* body of a man. j
The man was evidently one of the Sama
ria's crew and probably had been drowned
while making a futile effort to save bis
life by swimming.

seals from the channel islands, reposing

CRUSHED BY A HORSE.
Mrs. Id. B. Roienber; Seriously Injured
by the Animal Running Away and
Falling on Top of Her. i
Mrs. L. B. Rosenberg of 36 Maple court
met with a very serious accident last
evening and she is considered to be . in a
critical condition. v
About 5 o'clock a gentleman friend, who
had hired a horse from a .downtown
livery stable, rode up to the house and
made a call. The animal was a spirited
one, and as Mrs. Rosenberg is a fine horse
woman she expressed a desire to take a
turn on the horse. â¢.'..:. ;-â¢ ; *>:;.p ; *? ".;J-J.-~. .iJ' : <J
Tbe gentleman protested, as be thought
it bad not been accustomed to ladies, but
be yielded and she sprang into the saddle.
Maple conrt runs off Fourteenth street,
between Guerrero and Dolores, and as the
horse turned into Fourteenth street it
took the bit between its teeth and started
off at a furious gallop. Mrs. Rosenberg
lost complete control over tbe animal and
clung to the saddle for dear life. As the
horse turned sharply into Valencia street
it slipped and fell and rolled over the un
fortunate lady.
Several bystanders sprang to her as
sistance and dragged her from under the
horse. -A citizen, who was passing in his
buggy, pulled and she was lifted into
it and driven to her home. The family
physician was summoned, and he ex
pressed doubts of her recovery as she is
internally injured.

FIGBT AT AN OREGON DANCE.
Lafayette Farmer Fatally Stabbed in a
( ' ;:'--J_.. Free- for- All Battle.
LAFAYETTE, Or, May 10.â A fatal
stabbing affray occurred bout two mil s
north of here, on the Will Green farm,
at 2 o'clock yesterday morning. A neigh
borhood dance was in progress and r the
Garner brothers of Lafayette were there.
It seems that a quadrille was called, while
some of the dancers wanted a waltz.
Then the row began. The men went
outside the house on a porch and six or
seven of them began to fight. Pistols
were brought out, and knives were used.
After a few blows Will Hill said he was
stabbed in the abdomen, and went over
to where Wirt Garner was standing, and
with several others accused Garner of
having been his assailant. The doctors
say there is no hone of Hill's recovers*.
( FOOD COFFEE.
LESS HARD LIQUORS.
And More of a Food-Drink in Demand.
At the bars of the betier class nowadays
there is a call for some hot -.drink that .is
non-alcoholic and it is coming to be quite
the thing â to serve "Postum,' ' the ; grain
coffee, made at Battle Creek, Mien. It is
known to ; be highly nutritious and have
none ;of the ill ' effects of coffee, or any
j other unnatural stimulant., A men grow
older and wiser the tendency is toward
healthful food and drint, leaving tbe hard
liquors to the youngsters who think they
can stand anything. Postum "makes red
blood," and the time comes to every one
when a rebuilding, of * blood and tissue
along the lines of better health is neces-
sary. There is but one royal - road, i. c.,
through good food and healthful drink.
A reliable grocer will never offer a cheap
or weak ; imitation : of : a genuine original
article because he happens to make a Tit-
tle extra profit. - But it is well to observe
when genuine Postum - Cereal coffee
is ordered that you get Postum and not a'
spurious imitation offered' as "just as
good." . â¢ â  ; *
CARTER'S TRIAL
NEARING AN END
Evidence Presented to
the Mare Island
Court.
The Lieutenant's Threatening
Letters to Doughty of
Healdsburg.
i . '''â â :â ' -.; .â ' : .;
Promised to Make It Lively for the
Sonoma Man's Son in the
Navy.
VALLEJO, Cal., May 10.â The Carter
court-martial at the navy-yard is still
dragging its weary length along, but with
prospects of being brought to an early
termination. As near as . can be learned,
the facts so far adduced are as follows:. â¢
J. A. Doughty of Healdsburg had a son
who shipped as landsman on the receiv
ing-ship Independence in 189. or 1895.
Lieutenant Fidelio Carter was, and is
still, one of the officers of the Inde
pendence. One of his duties is to drill
the men in the manual of arms. Young
Doughty, it appears, was not lively
enough in [ his movements to suit the
lieutenant, and it is claimed that the boy
wrote to. bis father that the lieutenant
had struck him with his sword and other
wise ill treated him. The father there
upon wrote the lieutenant a sharp letter,
which was responded to with a battery of
hotshot, the lieutenant declaring that the
boy was idiotic and of no account.
Shortly afterward the boy. deserted and
went borne. He was brought back to the
ship and turned over to the proper au
thorities. Evidently warm words passed
between Doughty senior and Lieutenant
Carter, for on the Healdsburs man's re
tarn home in October, 1895, the letter
written to him by the lieutenant was for
warded to Secretary of the Navy Herbert,
who referred it to Captain Frank Wildis,
then in command of the receiving-ship In
dependence, for investigation.
Captain Wildes made a report to the
Navy Department exonerating the lieu
tenant from the charge of having struck
young Doughty or in any other manner
maltreated him. The report was evi
dently satisfactory to the Secretary, as
nothing further was beard of the matter
until last month.
Thoughts of the charges made to the
Navy Department evidently rankled in
the brain of Lieutenant Carter. In
March last he indited another letter to
Mr. Doughty, asking bim to withdraw the
charges from the Navy Department, as
they stood in the way of his being held in
favor by the Navy Department or his
brother officers. Now, here is where the
lieutenant made the error by adding the
implied threat tbat if the letter was net
withdrawn he would make it lively for the
boy, who was still under him; that be
would rake up the desertion case and
have him tried and punished.
This letter was by Mr. Doughty for
warded to the Secretary of the Navy, who
immediately ordered Lieutenant Carter
tried by court-martial. The charges and
specifications were two in number; one
for scandalous conduct prejudicial to the
interests of good morals in the navy, and
the other for conduct unbecoming a gen
tleman and an officer of the navy. - *"â *' - >
The court now engaged in trying the
case includes these officers: , Captain
Loui. KempS, president; Commander
Hanford of the Alert, Major Pope from
the barracks, Lieutenant - Commanders
Speyers and Perkins, and Lieutenants
Phelps, ' Milton, Lefevre and Hughes.
Lieutenant Dion Williams from the bar
racks is acting as Judge Advocate, and
Judge Highton of San Francisco and
Lieutenant C. Marat Perkins from the
barracks are acting as counsel for the ac
cused. : '*. : *â¢ â¢' ' '
Mr. Doughty, It is understood, simply
sent the Carter letter to the Secretary and
made no direct complaint against the
accused.' I^-'tlJ]

Monitor Landed a Purse at) lds of 15
to Iâ Lady Hurst Firs Past
â¢he Wire. )
If the sport at Emeryville esterday is
any criterion the favorites te going to
have a hard row to hoe the hai weeK of
the season. The attendance was good,
and the talent had the pleasur of seeing
five of the six choices bowled per. Many
of the winners were not withot friends,
which prevented the inembersif the ring
from corraling all the circtating me
dium.
The only race of the afternon afflicted
with any class was the mi} and a Six
teenth, with Wheel of Forane, imp.
Trance, Instaliaior and Beiardillo as
starters. "The Wneel" open! an even
money chance, but a stare was^rected by
Trance being hammered down 15 to 5,
and 8 to 5 was obtainable again the mare
around post time. She went y Bernar
dino in the stretch and, hid pressed
at the tape, beat Instaliatori length in
1:481^. Bergen on Trance ws outrun,
hti.Miing last.
The brown gelding Perhaps*vas a pro
nounced 9 to 10 choice lor te onening
event over five and a half furloes but his
chance* were killed by racing ff in front
-with Heartsease and he fadediway near
ing tbe stand. Hennessy on he 15 to 1
â  hot drew out of the bunch an in a drive
Jed Blue Bell out two lengths in I:o9'^.
Hear;.Â«eaÂ«f bung on, capturing the show.
Lady Hurst, a 3 to 1 chanc. took the
mile selling run that followed a field
of fourteen facing the barrier, tough with
a better ride Devault. the 13 ti s favorite,
which was plainly the best, sbuid have
taken the money. Clawson toe the Lady
iff in front tit the turn and ac was en
abled to win at the end by 1 length in
1:43. The first choice finished i the place
luliy fifteen lenctbs before Wiow Jones.
The third event at seven inrlogs lo> ked
like tough timber and all nine c the start
ers were accorded more or les support.
Midlight and Horatio both opeed at twos.
The latter eventually closed faorite with
Midlight receding to 5 to I Jimmy
Bozeman, on the outsider Vragua, set
the pace to the stretch followd by Mid
lieht and the first choice. Beitw the fur
long pole Bob Lorn got up wit) Lost Girl
and in a drive from that poiit on out
finished Una Colorado, which came fast
on the inside, and gained the vrdict by a
head. The winner was 6tol ii the ring.
Tom Kiiey's slashing good eet Salabar,
a brown son of Salvator and Btvaria, fur
nished the surprise in the tvo-year-old
six-furlong run. Marty Bergtn had the
leg up, and, keeping bis mouniin reserve
till the stretch was reached, noved up,
and at the wire easily downed the hard
ridden and swerving favorite Mchael 111.
Torsida ran very disappointingly, tailing
to land within the money. El-snore, which
finished third with 113 pounds up, was a
20 to 1 shot in the ring.
The Cambridge stable's Perseus, al
though he has failed to shew winning
form in his past two races, wai a li to 10
choice for the final race at th) day, and
again suffered defeat. Clawson, nitride
the 6to 1 shot Fortunate, toot the lead
from the start and, maintaining it to the
end, won ridden out a bnp.th ahead of
San Marco in 1:42. The fsvorite was third,
a head away. j -

THE RAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 1, 1897.
WADING THROUGH
THE DULL PERIOD
Counsel for the Fair Ex
ecutors Making Slow
Progress.
Foreman Ksele's Entry Book
T Found to Have Beea
Mutilated.
-â¢
He Flippantly Attributes the Tamper
ing to " Carelessness, Frirolty
or Humbug."
Recent proceedings in the Fair-Craven
litigation have certainly been dry enongb,
due chiefly to the slow progress made by
those who seek to prove tbat the Craven
deeds are not genuine, but when the hot
wave got in its work yesterday the tired
feeling became epidemic. The elimina
tion of the usual morning session, in order
to accommodate one of the jurors, short
ened the day somewhat, but even after
that breathing spell the case dragged
feebly at best.
The attorneys for the executors of the
Fair estate progressed but a fraction of a
stingy inch, and that was by passing from
the weary discussion of notarial blanks to !
the quizzing of a lone witness regarding
the daily routine of his humdrum life in
a dingy printing office. Blanks were bad
enough, but when this witness began to
read off entry after entry contained in a
series of thumbed order-books, covering a
period of several years, those who were
compelled to remain in court yawned and
stretched and kicked themselves to keep
awake, while everybody else c. eared out.
Once and only once did there develop
premonitory symptoms of a general
awakening. That was when D. M. Deimas,
leading counsel for MrÂ«. Craven, called the
attention of Foreman Keefe of tne Crocker
printing establishment to a number of
erasures and other evidences of tampering
in one of those order-books. :â â¢ v
"lean only attribute that to carelessness,
frivolity or humbug," replied Keefe upon
being asked for an explanation.
But Mr. Deimas wanted to know more
about it than that, so Keefe went on to
say that somebody, "for want of something
else to do." must have been monkeying
with the book.
"Is this the way you have been in the
habit of keeping" your accounts?" asited
the attorney sharply. IS " '
Keefe said he did not attend to the ac
counts himself at all times. It must have
"been the boy," who had wanted for some
thing else to do and satiated his desire by
mutilating the book.
That was as far as the thing went. Mr.
Deimas had made his point by casting a
bi-; black doubt on the reliability of those
records, and did not pursue Keefe farther.
Mrs. Craven was absent from court yes
terday owing to continued illness, but
the defense's table wa^ brightened by the
presence of Miss Margaret Craven and a
lady friend.
The examination of Keefe having been
left unfinished when court adjourned last
Friday, that individual resumed the stand
when the proceedings began. Over two
hours of Friday's session were wasted by
the attorneys for the plaintiffs in an effort
to prove by this witness what the custom
was iv the Crocker place as regards the
printing of legal blanks. Mr. Deimas, for
the defense, professed not to understand
the motive for interjecting such evidence,
and objected to it on general principle,
with the result that, try as he would, Mr.
McEnerney could not get it in.
Just before adjournment, however, Mr.
McEnerney assured the other side that he
merely wished to lay the foundation for
other evidence by means of Keefe's testi
mony, and on that all objections were
withdrawn. So it was, then, that when
Keefe resumed the stand yesterday he
began the narration of nothing more in
teresting than a s eepy story about the
process of turning out legal blanks. When
an order comes from the blank depart
ment for the manufacture of these sheets,
it is accompanied by a "copy" of the par
ticular one desired. Keefe receives these
and turns them over to the compositors,
proofs are taken, ana when everything is
in apple-pie order the pressmen do the
rest. It was in reference to the ramifica
tions of the "proofs." however, that the
attorneys wanted Keete to be most ex
plipit. for there is one of these things
that figures as an exhibit of great impor
tance in this case.
Keefe was at last excused, and "the
boy" who, for want of something else to
do, got the foreman into that scrape about
the records, was called and sworn. Dan
Murphy, he said, was his name. Dan is
just 20. He has been with the Crocker
Company four years, and his job is to as
sist Keefe. Murphy remembered that not
so very long ago he hunted up a package
of legal-blank "proofs" that were printed
in January, 1896, and turned it over to his
superiors. And that was as far as he got,
for court now adjourned. Dan will tell
the rest of hi- story to-day. _;"

GALEN CLARK

Yosemite Valley's. Guar
dian Now Seeks
Rest.
Over Twenty Years in the
Service of the Great
Reservation
He Has Been the Host of All tbe
Celebrities Who Have Cro?se3
tbe Hills.
Galen Clark, for many years the Guard
ian of the Yosemite Valley, will soon re
sign his position and retire to private life
and live out the remainder of his days in
absolute rest. It is likely that when the
Commissioners bold their next meeting in
the valley, next month, they will select
his successor V;:i|!
Mr. Clark is now 83 years of age and he
feels that a younger man should assume
GALEN CLARK, for a Quarter of a Century Guardian of the
YoJemite Valley, Who Will Soon Resign.
[From a photograph by Taber.] ...
the roanv cares and responsibilities that
attach to the position he has held so long.
For over twenty years he has been the
Guardian of this beautiful reservation, ex
cepting a short time he was one ot the
Yosemite Valley Commissioners, and Mr.
Hutchings was the Guardian.
Mr. Clark first went into the valley in
1856. He was lured there by the stories
told of the unsurpassed beauty and
grandeur of the scenery. Most of those
stories were told by the Indians, for at
that time but few white men had visited
the place, and they were in search of gold
rather than the beauties or nature. As
the valley was in tbe heart of the moun
tains and not upon any regular traveled
road, Mr. Clark did not remain the**e long,
but he never went very far away. He set
tled down on the Wawona road, where he
established a small wayside store and
hotel where he served the then large trav
eling public. As the valley became better
known pleasure-seekers and tourists be
gan to visit it, and most of these stopped
at Mr. Clark's. '*
As stated, Mr. Clark bas been officially
connected with the valley and commission
for about twenty years. " During this time
and the years preceding, Mr. Clark has
been acquainted with and the host of some
of the most celebrated people in the world
who have visited this coast, for few have
departed witbout going to the Yosemite
Valley. Thus by. this time, Galen Clark,
pioneer and Guardian of the valley, is
known all over the world.
His retirement is not solicited by the
commission, for he is still physically and
mentally vigorous. He is getting old, he
tells the Commissioners, and wants to live
the remainder of his days in peace and
without cares, among the natural beauties
that first charmed his younger fancy. His
wishes will be gratified, for the Commis
sioners will permit him to live in the val
ley to the end of his days, if he so wills,
and such is probably the case. Old Guard
ian Clark has repeatedly staled t'iat be
wants to live, die and be interred in what
he believes to be the grandest scenery out
of doors. To this end he has selected a
neat little plat in the reservation ceme
tery where he wants his remains to be
placed. Until he goes to his last ret the
board will provide the old man with a
neat cottage, where he may live in com
fort, for he is fairly well provided with
means, - having always * been economical
and industrious.
At the request of Governor Budd the
regular meeting of the Commissioners was
held Saturday instead of yesterday. 1 Most
of the proceedings were of a routine char
acter. ' ;*, * * a
Miles Wallace was elected vice-presi
dent in niace of Henry X. : Field, and
Abbott Kinney of Los Angeles was ap
pointed a commissioner. Charles 8. Given
was made a member of tne finance com
mittee.'/*;-; ,\ .- .**.-,-' xi-'Jr
It was decided to expend whatever sum"
may be necessary to put in a new boiler,
improve the kitchens and build dressing
rooms for ladies - who - go driving in the
valley. ______________________

NOW FOR DOGS

The San Francisco Kennel

Great Success.

show. ' â 'â J:iJ i^y â  ':
Dog shows in San Francisco have been
generally well-patronized, particularly by
local dog fanciers. But it is said by the
managers of the San Francisco Kennel
Club that the coming show will attract
attention from the surrounding country
as well as from this City, because entries
have been xeceived from all parts of the
State. . * _ 1
Quite a number of names of diminutive
dogs of all colors and pedigrees imagina
! ble figure on the entry list. There are the
little "toy" dogs, and then there are
noble St. Bernards with majestic looking
heads and intelligent eyes which will cause
no end of comment, as competition among
them will be very keen.
The setters and pointers will be many,
and among the former class there will be
very close competition, as the lovers of the
sporting dogs have been importing new
stock and infusing new blood into this
State within the past year from the lead
ing kennels of the East. , .".'..
The fox terriers will be strongly repre
sented this year, and it goes without say
ing that particular interest will be mani
fested by the breeders in the judging of
this class of dogs.
Mason surprised the talent at the last
bench show held in this City by bis sys
tem of judging, which some local experts
said was foreign, in many respects, to
what tt.e local breeders of fox terriers ex
pected. But then every judge hhs his own
views on form and. construction, conse
quently the breeders of fox terriers may
expect to hear of many changes in
Mason's system of judging at the inau
gural bench show of the San Francisco
Kennel; Club. '- '. -â ' â¢**" " ' -

to Growth.
At an enthusiastic meeting, of citizens
of the Western Addition held in Franklin
Hall, Fillmore street, last evening, a club
was formed for the purpose of promoting
the material interests of that section of
the City.
Permanent organization was effected
and the following officers were elected:
W. H. Hazell, president; Dr. C. V. Cross,
vice-president; J. Henderson, secretary.
After an animated discussion of the many
needs of the locality, the I following reso
lutions were unanimously adopted: J ,-. ; â 
Whereas, The Western Addition Develop
ment Club has been organized for the purpose
of uniting the citizens and property-owners
in this portion of the City in an' effort to pro
mote its * advancement > and .prosperity ; and
whereas, the several cemeteries herein lo
catea constitute an almost absolute barrier to
the growth of the City westward, and area
constant menace to the health 01 our citizens ;
therefore - . ...-..â¢..
Resolved, That, among other obJects.we have
in view, we will use all honorable . means
toward the abatement of this evil. -:â ,..
Resolved, That we heartily indorse' the senti
ment expresed by his Honor, Mayor Phelan, in
his inauuural address to : the Board of Super
visors, touching the matter of city growth and
improvement, ana realize, with him, the fact
that the -cemeteries located in the Western
Addition ! constitute an obstruction to the
growth of the City greater than all others
combined.:
'â  Resolved, That 'â¢ tbe Mayor Is to be com
mended for his efforts to abate this evil, to
create .public sentiment favoring the same,
and in calling the attention ot the Boar a of
Supervisors and the Board of Health thereto.
We believe that he should be sustained , ln his
laudable efforts, thereiore
Resolved, That we will give to him and to all
others who join with him ,in his efforts our
moral support and influence on all occasions,
and will do all in our power to bring about the
closing, within a reasonable length of time, of
tne cemeteries which now obstruct the prog
ress and development ot | that portion of the
City in which we are so greatly interested. â -.-
We believe that the Board of Health now has
the authority and pov.er to enact such sani
tary laws as will cause burials in the City cem
eteries to cease. Therefore,' "\ ''â¢*'â¢ ' â¢ '.*â â¢*-
J Resolved, That the power of said Doard be
earnestly invoked in the premises, to; the end
that further burials therein be prohibited by

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THE SUMMER MONTHS.
Are you poinf: to the country on a vacation ? If
ro. It is no trouble ior us to forward THE CALL to
your address. Do not let It miss you for you will
miss it. Orders given to the carrier or left at
Business Office will receive prompt attention.
KO EXTKA CHARGE.
The summer came in this time with a
spring and lauded with both feet. *
The friends of Greece sympathized, but
those of Turkey lent a helping hand.
Work on the new Federal building will
surely begin this summer. The agitation
has not been in vain.
This year may not break the record for
disasters on sea and land, but it is keep
ing well up to the extreme limit.
This week will probably see the end of
the war in Europe, but the cause of the
disturbance will remain and there will be
another war by and by.
We have had plenty of warm weather
for City people to enjoy the picnic season,
and now we can join tbe farmers in get
ting up an agitation for rain.
Tbe warm spell has been decidedly
favorable to tha idea of establishing more
park?. Everybody feels the need of them
and is inclined to help them along.
Spain had better inform the Cubans
they are not worth the. money it costs to
govern them, and so take her troops.
and dismiss the war with Castilian scorn.
The Boers and v the British in South
Africa are increasing their armaments,
not for the purpose of making war on one
another, but as mutual assurances of the
maintenance of peace.
The revival of business goes on so
smoothly and steadily that few people
take note, but nevertheless we are rapidly
passing from the Democratic depression
to a stage of normal prosperity.
Chinese are reported to be coming in
over the Mexican as well as the Canadian
border, and it seems about as hard to keep
them out of this country as it is to keep
jackrabbits out of a Fresno vineyard.
The prospects are that the brilliancy of
the approaching celebration of the Queen's
jubilee will be marred by two dark spots:
the high prices ior windows overlooking
the parade and the inevitable poem by Mr.
Austin.
The concert of Europe has developed
into an alliance of the three Emperors,
while the rest of Europe is on the outside
waiting for the tune to be set and wonder
ing whether there will be any part in it
for them to play.
One set of men are urging the House of
Representatives to take up the currency
question, and another set are urging that
something be done at once to promote
American shipping, so life at the capital is
rapidly becoming warm.
The movement to establish harmony
between the National League of Musicians
and the American Federation of Musicians
ought to be easily accomplished if there is
any man in either association who is capa
ble of striking the keynote in the right
pitch.
Omaha fought hard a short time ago to
prevent the Missouri from splitting the
town in two and flowing througn the
middle, but as she has now two Mayors
and duplicate sets of officers in all depart
ments of the municipal government she
would have done better to save her energy
and money and let the river take its
course. -* T 'â ;
The investigation of the way the civil
service was administered under the Cleve
land administration has brought to light
many glaring instances of favoritism, and
it begins to appear now that the best way
to reform the service would be to get rid
of the Cleveland rules and appointments
altogether with a clean sweep and then
start over again.
The Salisbury administration has not
played a distinguished part in European
diplomacy this spring, but the Liberal
party in England has eat an even worse
figure. Instead of following the splendid
lead given by Gladstone, each of the as
pirants for Liberal leadership started a
little tune of his own, and the result was a
Confusion of weak sounds. instead of a
swelling chorus which would have carried
all England with it.
, The amount and quality of the schemes,
plans, suggestions and proposals for
restraining the Mississippi which have
been advanced since the recent floods
have so wearied the minds of those who
live in the stricken districts that the New
Orleans Picayune has been fed to declare
that "what some people do not know
about the levee system would overflow the
river banks at any season of the year if it
could be lumped together, and dropped
into the water."
The tax on bequests in England is said
to have yielded a revenue during tbe last
fiscal year.of over $70,000,000, and the op
eration of the law is so : satisfactory in
every way that some of the Massachu
setts papers are urging the adoption of a
similar tax in that State to the exclusion
of all other taxes on personal property.
The Boston Herald estimates that in that
city alone such a tax without being made
too onerous would produce a revenue of
about $6,000,000 yearly.
THE FEDERAL BUILDING.
The announcement in The Call of Sunday that notice had been given to tenants
of premises on the site of the proposed Federal building to surrender them within
thirty days is conclusive evidence that at last we are to have the beginning of that
long delayed work. The agitation begun by The Call, and so well and strongly sup
ported by the commercial and industrial organizations of the City, is to be crowned
with success. 'J\?. : -%'
According to statements made by Mr. Irish, the notice served on the tenants
means that work will begin with the first of the fiscal year. Contracts for excavating
and the foundation work will be let as soon after June las possible. Tests made by
the engineers have proven the site to be perfectly safe for the building, and there is no
reason to look for or fear any farther delay in the construction of the edifice.
It is hardly necessary to point out the benefits we may expect from the prompt
beginning of the work. It will mean the employment at good wages cf large num.
bers of skilled and unskilled workmen for months to come. It will put into escala
tion large sums of money and thereby materially.' advance the retail trade of the City.
It will go far to relieve the overstocked labor market ana benefit indirectly even
those workmen who do not find employment on the building itself. In short, we
have many reasons to congratulate ourselves on the prospect ahead, and to look for
ward to the coming work with sanguine expectations.
We would lose much of the benefit of the work on the building if wo' overlooked
the moral contained in the experience we have had with it. There is every reason
to believe the work would have begun long ago and the building be completed by
this time, if our citizens had worked together in harmony to accomplish it. Unfortu
nately, for a long time there was a fight made against the site by men who were evi
dently determined that San Francisco should- have no new building unless it were
placed on some site of their own selection. While the counsels of such men and
their organs prevailed, dissensions were rife and every effort for the building made at
Washington was defeated by the opposition at San Francisco.
That these dissensions would have Deen as disastrous now as in the past had they
not been counteracted by a more potent influence cannot be questioned. It was in
this work The Call was able to render valuable service to the community. By re
newing the agitation for the building and calling upon men who could be reiied on to
work together harmoniously for the accomplishment of the task, it succeedod in
arousing public opinion here, silencing the voices of dissension and bringing to bear
at Washington the force necessary to enable our delegation in Congress to get the offi
cials in charge to begin the work without further delay.
Congressman Loud has been particularly active in promoting the work at Wash
ington and deserves thanks. We are also indebted to the McKinley administration
for its promptness in reversing the do-nothing policy of Cleveland. We can fully
recognize and appreciate these services without in any way detracting from the fact
that when the work on the structure is begun it will be to us another evidence of the
value of harmony in public enterprises, and another proof that if we turn away from
those who would raise dissensions among us for personal advantage, we can accom
plish almost anything we desire in the way of municipal development.
A FLEETING CHANCE.
According to reports in the Eastern
press such chances as we may nave had to
get San Francisco included among the
cities to be visited by the coming delega
tion of merchants from Mexico, Central
and South America is rapidly passing
away. The time fixed for their arrival is
near at hand, and arrangements for their
reception are about completed.
The latest information on the subject is
to the effect that the delegation will num
ber sixty-five, including twenty members
from the provinces of Mexico, Many of
the most important commercial bodies in
South America will be represented. The
delegates are expected to arrive in Phila
delphia on the 2d of June, and there they
will be the guests of the Philadelphia mer
chants. Their itinerary provides for a
stay of seven days in Philadelphia and
about five days in New York. From there
they will go to New England, and then
westward as far as Minneapolis and St.
Paul, returning to New York for a lew
days.
The object of the delegation in visiting
this country is to see what the United
States offers that will be attractive to the
trade of the countries south of us. Cali
fornia bas a good deal to show in that
way. San Francisco therefore should have
been included in the list of cities to be vis
ited. "When the delegation reaches St.
Paul it should continue west, instead of
returning East, and perhaps it is not yet
too late to have the route changed.
Considerable attention has been given
of late in this City to the subject of South
American trade. It would seem tbat a
visit of so many representative merchants
from those countries would materially aid j
us in promoting it. If we are to have the ;
visit, however, is clear we must act ;
promptly. There may be a chance 'yet to
bring the visitors here, but the chance is j
a fleeting one, and if any action is to be ;
taken it must be taken without delay.
WOMEN AND TEE "POWERS."
The press dispatches yesterday in
formed us that Crown Princess Sophie of
Greece had again been to the pains of
affirming into the ears of her royal
brother, William of Germany, her own
personal conviction of the justice of her
royal father-in-law's policy in Crete. This
valuable assurance was supplemented by
tbe sisterly inference that the big brother
would forthwith step dutifully forward
and champion her desires.
Up to date the big brother has'dis
played an apathy in the face of this ap
peal which leads to the reluctant sus
picion that he is not altogether what he
might be in the way of a champion for a
sister in distress. On the contrary, there
have been voices supposedly authorized
to speak for Emperor William which
have been bold enough to intimate that
of all the "powers" Germany will be tho
last to accede to King George's wishes in
the matter of a settlement with Turkey.
King William, it is solemnly averred,
may even insist I hat King George cease
being a king. Just what relevancy this
amazing flight of fancy may be thought
to bear to Greece's dispute with Turkey no
human being is able to discern, nor is any
one but the Kaiser's family physician
likely to find anything serious in the re
puted remark. But that and other
meditations of the "powers," Germany,
included, are being none the less indus
triously circulated for the world to ob
serve and be entertained by. And all this
in spite of the fact tbat Princess Sophie
and other female relatives of the royal
principals in arms are employing their
feminine wits to turn the tide the other
way.
Women have been at the bottom of
some of the most famous state intrigues,
wars and diplomatic deals tbat were ever
known, and in all cases their influence
has been felt in some degree*. There has
always been a woman at every court of
war in history who has wielded more In
fluence in the affairs at hand than has
the king whose favorite she chanced to
be. Sne has been a bad woman rather
tban a good one in most cases, but not in
allâ for occasionally a king has been
found so rare in disposition as to find a
favorite in his wife, and some wives are
not bad. Other kings have bad sisters
whom they listened to with favor and who
were good. , That j may have been the re
flection which encouraged Princess Sophie
to approach Emperor William, forgetting
that where twenty good relatives, fair and
beautiful, have failed in such an affair
one bad outsider equally fair and beauti
ful has succeeded, and that nineteen more
outsiders in nineteen other cases might
succeed just as readily while all the rela
tives on earth were failing.
Have the : Princess of Greece, the Prin
cess of Wales and the Dowager Czarina
of Russia accomplished anything by their
energetic appeals in Greece's behalf? Did
the ; mother influence her son, the
daughter her mother, or the sister J her
brother? Answer these queries and then
reflect upon whether or not the rulers of
other periods and of other wars were ever
influenced by other kind of women.
THE SAN: FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 11. 1897.
FARM TAXES.
The United States Department of Agri
culture has issued a circular on "Local
Taxation as Affecting Farms," which w4il
be read with interest throughout the
country and may be studied with advan
tage by all who are concerned in questions
of tax legislation. The* circular is based
mainly upon data obtained In New York,
but it reviews the tax laws of other States,
including California, and affords a fairly
comprehensive summary of the system of
farm taxation throughout the Union.
The report points out that while local
taxation is a subject discussed by confer
ences of farmers with more earnestness
than any other subject of legislation, and
a great deal of. discontent is felt with
present conditions, yet there is not a State
in the Union in which the general methods
of taxation as they now stand were not
originally dictated by farmers, The laws,
however, have not operated as was ex
pected. As the report says, "The farmers
in all the States have obtained all the
laws which they asked for, but they never
could make these laws work.''
The evil, it is said, does not lie in dis
honest or inefficient administration. On
the contrary, it is declared that taking the
country over "the better tbe law ie from
the farmer's theoretical standpoint the
worse it is for him in practice, and the
more faithfully it is administered the
more does the average farmer suffer from
its effect.'* Even the California system of
requiring a detailed assessment of prop
erty separately classified does not prouuce
the hoped-for results, and leaves the bur
den of personal property taxation much
heavier on the farms of the Slate than on
the cities.
Statistics gathered for the purpose of
this investigation show that while a
larger proportion of personal property Is
returned under the listing system than
under the other system, yet in all cities
governed under that system the propor
tion of personal property to real property
shrinks about as much with each succeed
ing year a3 in cities where no lists are re
quired, while the proportion of personal
property belonging to farmers which is
assessed and taxed under the listing sys
tem is greater than it is where that system
does not exist.
Until further and completer studies have
been made of the subject it will not be
possible to draw definite conclusions as to
the best means of remedying the evils that
are now apparent. The author of the cir
cular under review estimates, upon the
basis of assessments made in Massachu
setts, that if farms were assessed only at
their strictly unimproved value the valua
tion would be only 40 per cent of the im
proved or market value, while the unim
proved value of city lots should be 58 per
cent of the improved value. In some
States tbe assessments as made at present
almost reverse this percentage.
The subject is one which requires the
scientific study ot trained experts to deal
with it thoroughly. No true remedy can be
found by the struegle of town and farm to
shift the weight of the burden of taxation
upon tbe other by means of boards of
equalization, which, as the circular says
of that in New York, "every year In
creases tho valuation of New York City,
although it is honestly made, and de
creases the valuation in the interior of
the State, where it is , far less honestly
made, for the sole purpose of taking off
one or two million dollars a year from tha
farmers' taxes and laying them upon the
large cities.'' .

New York Tribune.
Senator Faulkner tells; an Interesting Inci
dent of his recent trip to New York. The
famous Stonewall Brigade band, of Staunton,
Va., went to New York as the guest of Charles
Broadway Roues, a former Virginian. The
members were: quartered at the Windsor
Hotel, and after the arrival of the President
serenaded him. : Then . they played in the
lobby of the hotel. After they had finished
one of the band came up to Senator Faulkner
and asked if General Gordon was In the party.
Upon being iniormed that the ex-Confederate
commander was in .the hotel the musician
said he would like to see General Gordon and
remind him of an Incident of the war. When
the Georgia ex-Senator was found the mem
ber of the band said : â â â â -<
"General Gordon, I want to remind you of a
promise you made. We were before Fort Sted
man. p* Early in- the -morning, before the as
sault, you came by, and rising in your stir
rups and looking over the ground you said
that you would give every man who entered
Fort Stedmau that day a sixty days' furlough
and a gold medal. I was one of those who
went into Fort Stedman, and I now call upon
you to redeem your promise."
"I remember the incident perfectly," replied
General Gordon. "I am sorry that I can' give
yon the medal, but Grant has given you the
promised furlough." '. â â ' *â -â -*
A little later ex-Governor Flower of New
York heard of the incident, and got General
Gordon and the former Virginia private to
gether. "Grant has given you the furlough
which General Gordon promised," he said to
the musician, -'and I will see that the other
onion of the general's promise is redeemed,
will give yon a gold medal as soon as Gen
eral Gordon prepares a suitable inscription
for it." ;.- .: - . __*-'â¢-.

The Doom of the Silver Party.
Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: The inner circles of the banking syndicates of New
York and London probably understand the purport of the news Item given below better than
the general public, audi have not a' doubt in the world that my interpretation of it is en
tirely in accord with the concealed truth of the situation; nor am I the less certain of it be
cause there may not be a dozen renders who will at first agree with me. It is a cablegram
trom the hadquarters of the money power of the world in these words:
;_..._ â *-.. "London, Eng., May 1, 1897.
"The National Review, a monthly magazine, commenting on the appointment of Wolcott,
Paine and Stevenson as Commissioners to visit Europe tor the purpose of promoting the inter
national bimetallic agreement will say to-morrow: 'The commission will receive the cordial
co-operation of the British Government.' It adds that even Sir Michael flicks-Beach, Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, the only monometallist in the Cabinet, desires a settlement of the
question." â â ' - â  ?-~ 'â '. ''-â â '-'â  ~ -"c-" .
We are all agreed that this Is news of deep significance, end I desire to indicate its full
meaning as I understand ft. being quite willing that he who will shall laugh first, while I
wait to laugh last. This news means that the gold men now own nearly all the great silver
mines of the world, and in due time, perhaps in a few months, they will consent to the re
monetizationof sliver and they will thereby "clean up" two or three billion dollars, and at
the same time avert a world-wide crash which men of all shades of political opinion teel to be
in the air. * . f- I- ....
I Quite well I know, as I have intimated, how preposterons this may seem to most men, for
most men read the newspapers and take the news which is made up for them without a
thought as to its. source or inspiration. But let us go a little deeper than the surface, for the
item of news above reported is out of the ordinary, very decidedly. ... _.
While there is ample room in the news columns of our daily papers for pugilistic contests,
ball games, "bike" races, domestic scandals and like matters, there seems to be no room for
the news that millions of "English capital" have recently been invested in the great silver
mines of Mexico and in the more marvelous silver and lead mines of the far North, in the
Slocan district ol British Columbia, as well as in other silver-mining districts of the world.
This most significant and important news comes through private channels alone. *
" It is now no longer disguised that there is a growing apprehension in tne public mind that
the gold basis is too narrow for the volume of currency necessary for commercial and Indus
trial transactions, and hence there is urgent need for more primary or redemption money;
and. moreover, what is more to the point, the vote for free silver at the last election in the
United States, in spite of all that could be done by the gold men, was quite too alarmingly
large to render the future sufficiently certain for safe business purposes, while the continued
activity and zeal of the sliver "agitators" is contributing an element of still graver uncer
tainty. Only one remedy remainsâ corner and control the silver as well as the gold, and then
remonetiza silver and reap the profits. **:.*"'?:*â  s.-.j*-:* "' ; .''~* â  . ___, . _Â __ .
It is well known that many grave men begin to doubt if Increased tariff rates will bring
the prosperity they anticipated, since a large part of that increase is to be placed upon articles
consumed by the common people, who are not prosperous now and may not be able to buy the
goods manufactured under a protective tariff. : If this should prove measurably true there will
be disappointment and dissatisfaction Which may defeat the Republican party In 1900. But
with silver rernonetized and the National banks as owners of silver autnorlzed to issue silver
certificates in place of the Government there will be an era of great prosperity under the Mc-
Kinley administration which will end ma blaze of glory and will give the Republicans an
easy victory at the Dolls in 1900, and the silver craze will become silver sanity, with the honor
ot it duly accredited to the Republican party. This is what I anticipate. Hence the meaning
I put upon the London cablegram quoted. JOSEPH ASBT.RY JOHNSON.

The War in Cubaâ F. J. 3.. City. The di
rect cause of the war in Cuba was excessive
taxation and discontent about the March elec
tion in 1893, of representatives in the Spanish
cortes, together with inability to secure home
rule.
Land Subscriber, City. The land laws
and the manner in which Government lands
are open to settlement are too long to publish
in this department. For 25 cents you can

the pacer shelters the rider if there is a strong

against, and again If. there is no wind to in

California Volunteersâ F. J. M., City. The
statement made to you that "during the Civil
War San Francisco did not furnish enough
men to make up a regiment of 1001) men," is
not correct. The muster of the First Regiment
ot Cavalry, California Volunteers, shows 565
of the men composing it were enrolled in San
Francisco, that of the Second Regiment of
Cavalry shows that of the number of men
in it, 1454 were enrolled in San Francisco.
This being enough to disprove the assertion
the roster of the other companies were not ex
amined. In addition to the two regiments
named, there were: The First Battalion of
Native Cavalry, First RÂ«giment Infantry, First
Battalion Veteran Infantry, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth. Sixth, Seventh and Eighth reg
iments of Infantry, the First Battalion of Cali
fornia Mountaineers and the California Hun
dred. In the "Record of California Men in the
War of the Rebellion," compiled by Brigadier-
General R. 11. Orion, adjutant-general of the
State of California, published in 1890, occurs
,the following: . i,
The state of California, being located far away
from the more active scene of the war, was no:
called upon to furnish troops for immediate service
against the Confederate soldiers and no quota was
assigned to It; yet during ihe war calls were made
upon it for several regiments and for volunteers,
aggregating more than 16.000 men. besides 500
who wan enlisted within , Its borders and became
put of the quo a of Massachusetts and eight com-,
panics raised for Washingto â¢ Territory. â¢.-(. t
The State of <a!ii..rnta famished during the

by Chinese soldiers upon a Japanese column
at Seoul, Korea. July 23, 1894 and ended with
a treaty of peace in April 1895. The cause of

. *
Arr.val of the Chinaâ Au Exciting
Y.wl Race to B; Held N;xt
Sunday.
The Pacific Mall Company's China ar
rived from China, Japan and Hawaii yes
terday after a smart trip of 27 days 13
hours. Her run from Yokohama was
made in 16 days 15 hours 31 minutes, and
that from Honolulu was made in 5 days
20 hours and 6 minutes.
The vessel was not expected until this
afternoon, so her arrival ahead of time
was a surprise. She had 101 cabin passen
gers, 3 Europeans, 580 Chinese and 36
Japanese steerage passengers and 1610
tons of cargo. Strong northwest eales
were experienced during the entire pas
sage, but Captain Saunders says it was a
very pleasant run nevertheless.
All the cabin passengers were thor
oughly examined while the steamer was
at anchor off Meiggs wharf, and late dur
ing the afternoon were taken ashore in
the company's tug Millen Griffiths.
There was no disease on board, but as
smallpox is prevalent in Japan and diph
theria has broken out in Honolulu it was
thought belter to order the vessel into
quarantine. All the steerage passengers
will be fumigated, after which they will
be landed. Many of the Chinese wiil
leave on the overland train for the At
lanta Expo-ition; others are in transit for
Central America, and the remainder are
for Ban Francisco.
The China brought the news that the
American ship Indiana, loading Â«u,-ar at
Hilo. Hawaiian Islands, for New York,
had sprung a leak, but was in no imme
diate danger. Tbe water was kept down
by tbe pumps, and a diver was on bis way
from Honolulu to the scene when the
China sailed. It is thought that the leak
can be temporarily plugged and the vessel
sailed to either Honolulu or San Francisco
for permanent repairs.
The Japanese warship Naniwa was
daily expected at Honolulu. She has on
board Councilor Asiyama of the Foreign
Office and two representatives of tne Im
migration Office. They will look into tbe
matier of Japanese immigration in Ha
waii, which has been causing trouble be
tween the two countries.
A meeting of the shareholders of the !
schooner Bowbead was held yesterday,
but nothing definite was done. It was
proposed to sell the vessel at auction to
the highest bidder, but many of tbe â hare
holders refused the proposition. They
wanted ber sold for anything she would
bring over a stipulated sum. That prop
osition was also voted down, and then
some one proposed that she be advertised
for sale, and when that failed several of
the shareholders left the meeting in dis
gust. Those wbo remained then decided
to sell their individual interests to the
highest bidders.
Two failures during, successive seasons
on the coast of Japan caused the owners
of the Bowhead to lay the schooner up in
Oakland Creek, where she is now. She is
not improving with age, and the general
impression is that she should be sold, but
not at a great sacrifice. The probable
merging of four or five shareholders' in
terests in one hand may make a differ
ence in the complexion of affairs.
Harry Seimer and his brother Fred are
to sail a match race from Hunters Point
around Goat Island and back next Sun
day. The young men used to jointly own
the sloop Lizzie S, but latterly Fred has
completed a handsome new sloop which
be has named the Hazel, so ths partner
ship is dissolved. T.ie new boat will not
be of' the ways until Saturday night, but
Fred is so confident about her abilities
that he is ready and willing to sail the
moment she enters the water. A big
crowd from South San Francisco will fol
low the race in a tug.
The ship Charmer has been a little over
two weeks in port, yet her big cargo has
been discharged and part of her outward
cargo put aboard. Capt. Holmes expects to
get away the first of next week and says
he intends to make a new record for Hie
run between Ban Francisco and New York.
The ship Bt. David, which got in lust
Sunday afternoon, was docked at Harrison
street and was discharging yesterday after
noon.
All the Dunsmuir's hoppers and the
coalyards are full, so the steamer Welling
ton will be turned into a storeship for the
time being.

ALCAZAR ACTORS
WEAR THE QUEUE
Production of a Chinese
Melodrama by Amer
icans.
The Girls in "Excelsior Jr."
Prove Younger Tban
the Jokes.
"El Capitan" and "Shamin O'Brien"
Are Both Continuing Their
Run of Popularity.
With a burst of wild, barbaric music
and a demoniacal beating of gongs the
orchestra at tbe Alcazar last night at
tuned the startled audience to the proper
frame of mind for listening to Francis
Powers' lurid little drama of Chinatown,
"The First Born."
Mr. Powers has broken into pastures
new for an American dramatist in taking
Celestials for bis characters. Every
theater-goer has seen comic Chinamen
doing "turns'* in variety performances,
and "The Senator" boasts of one Celestial
who is taken seriously, but a real Chinese
play, full of the sights and sounds and
smells of Chinatown has never been seen
MAXINE ELLIOTT, Who Will Appear as Ada Injjot in David Gat-rick" at the Baldwin
Next Week.
upon the American stage before, and may
never be seen again.
Mr. Powers is evidently an advanced
realist, for his "First Born" is a regular
Celestial "Cavalleria Rusticana."' He has
taken just such a plot as might come up
any day in the police courts, over a Chinese
murder case, and has made the climax of
bis story the starting of the feud between
the See Yups and tbe Sam Yups.
The play is "Chines*, quite Chinese you
know," and an American audience, strug
gling rather hopelessly with the unfamiliar
names and the yellow faces, is only just
beginning to know who is who, when the
climax is reached.
Mr. Powers' friends say he has studied
for months to write and produce "The
First Born," and every line of his play
shows it, for he has actually succeeded in
becoming a foreigner In the midst of bis
own people, who are pleasingly alluded to
as "white devils'' throughout the per
formance.
- The dialogue is written in the Oriental
style of flowery compliment and imagery,
and contains some very pretty gems of
rhetoric, though this r rococo style of talk
rather cogs the wheels of combination for
dramatic purposes. -A
If Francis Powers has succeeded in
writing bis play from a Chinese stand
point, as far as "white d^vila" can judge
he has been even more successful in put
ting it on tbe stage "alice same China
town." , The scenery, the dresses, the
sounds are those of the Mongolian quar
ter, and by some occult means the over
powering smells are wafted across the
Alcazar's footlights in all their pristine
strength.
The audience was very much amused at
Miss May Buckley's mincing walk as a
slavegirl, held in durance vile, and
George Od bourne played a learned doctor,
as if : be had graduated at Canton. A
number of other members of the company
were ail more or less successfully dis
guised, most of them more, and the supers
were real Chinamen.
The audience, for some unexplained
reason,: received the performance with
frantic demonstrations of delight, and
Mr. Powers, being called on for a speech,
modestly responded by throwing Mowers
at George Os bourne and at Hip Long, a
Chinese gentleman who was enjoying the
performance from a private box and who
seemed nowise ; embarrassed at suddenly
being made a public character.
At thÂ« Baldwin.
The drawing- strength of "El Capitan" wu
well exemplified last evening. Every seat in
the theater was occupied, and many stood to
hear the music. â¢ It was : observed that the
audience was excellent in quality.; At the
close of the second net De Wolf Hopper wis !
recalled several times. He embraced the oc
casion to make a speech abounding in humor
and fcapDy allusions. The audience seemed
delighted to get something thai was not an
nounced on the programme, and rewarded the
speaker with generous applause.
At the Columbia.
For the present the Columbia is the house
of the man with the elastic limb, the lady with
the stripped voice and maidens galore with
abbreviated skirts, chic hats and patches on
chin and cheek.
p All these people form part and parcel of the
"Excelsior Jr." Company, a farce comedy that
starts out with .he commendable object of
presenting an extravaganza founded on a
well-regulated plot, but which, after the first
few scenes, evidently gave up the intention as
a very bad, unworthy and altogether ungra
cious job. If the management would be con
tent to give "Excelsior Jr." straight, without
senseless padding made up principally of stale
jokes and time-worn songs, the extravaganza
would be worthy of consideration. There are
some good people in the cast, old and tried
favorites, and several newcomers who are sure
to make lriends. "**., .*_ -1*0 .*:;
Sadie Martinot. who heretofore aimed at and
attained the dignity of a four-sheet i oster all
to herself, 18 a central and attractive figure in
dainty form and stunning hat. Her Imitation
of Yvette Guilbert went with a vim and dash,
and possessed all the chic one associates with
the original.
Johnny Page's Imitations are worthy an act
by themselves. They are original and clever,
and possess the true essence of fun and
comedy. "Excelsior" was handsomely
mounted, recalling to mind the gorgeous stage
pictures of the Christmas-tide extravaganza.
Grand Opera-House.
The patrons of Morosco's were treated last
night to a picturesque comedy-drama entitled,
â¢'The White Rat." The hero of this play man
ages to implicate himself in the murder of a
Swedish sailor. Of course he had nothing to
do with it. because the heavy villain always
attends to that sort of thing, but the hero is
sent to prison anyway and the villain bears off
the prizeâ a stuffed white rat, in which the
sailor has hidden a diamond of immense
value. After the villain bas disposed of the
jewel he puts his money out at Interest and
enjoys a prosperous life for a year or two.
Then the hero escapes and the villain'! trou
bles begin again. Finally, through the timely
aid of a man who goes blind right after the
murder, and who regains his sight right after
j the escape of the hero, the innocence of the ,
good young man is made plain and the
villain gets his jtut deserts and is dragged
away to prison, ana so ends the thrilling tale
of "The White Rat."
As the Swedish sailor, Landers Stephens
does some really excellent work. A number
of specialties are given, prominent among
them, being a musical team of Chine c Im
personators, Johnson and Harvey, and Baby
ewis, who does some clever singing and
dancing. The opium den was a triumph of
scenic art.
Next Monday Maud Edna Hall will make
her reappearance in "East Lynne."
At the Auditorium.
Mrs. Dlmond still continues along the tight
path that she hopes will ultimately lead her to
favor. Tne audiences at the Auditorium have
steadily diminished since the night the lady
made her initial bow, and the third week
found only a scant audience to revel in her
mixed voice and too. too solid flesh. The
operetta moves along smoothly and tunefully,
ani what the choruses have lost in numbers
they have added ln excellence. Mrs. Dimond
is determined to stick to the stage just as long
as she can charm an audience into the theater.
Her chances are growing daily beautifully
less, and now would seem to be the time for
the lady's admirers to come to tho front and
cheer her on.
Tivoli Opera- House.
. "Shamus O'Brien" entered into the third
week of a prosperous run at the Tivoli last
night. Mr. O'Sullivan, Mr. d'Arcy and all the
rest of the cast are making themselves more
popular, and the play Is still drawing we 11 ..;

Several of last ween's favorites are still
drawing well at the Orpheum. ; Alexander
Tacianu, the soprano-barytone, is an especially
applauded performer, and ; the ' charming
dancing of Fleurette and her four Fieurs de
Lis win as many expressive sighs of approval

appearance last night, and sang several popu

tunately the crocodile sprained his wrist so
severely that 'he will be unable .to appear

Finished Last Even

The Largest Gain Known in
vÂ£% This City for a Number
of Years Past
s
An Exhaustive Canvass That Cost tbe
City $6000 Approved by Super
intendent Webster.
The taking of the school census of this
City wbich has occupied the attention of
Census Marshal Wardell and a large staff
of assistants for some time past was fin
: ished late last night, when the last of the
I clerical work was done and the results
! submitted to Superintendent of Schools
i Webster for his approval. . ,; 'J
The increase of 2013 children of school
age over the number recorded last year is
! the largest known for several years past,
! and Superintendent Webster believes tbat
1 the canvass has been mo-t thorough. In
many districts where there was reason to
believe that fewer children than actually
existed were recorded it was necessary to
canvass several times, and a number of
blocks were canvased as many as five
times.
r In order to finish tbe work within the
time required by law it was necessary in
some instances to work the men on Sun
days, and this additional labor, taken with
the large number of men employed, has
brought the expenses of the census up to
about $6000.
It was found in many cases where pu
pils reported that the census-takers had
not called at tbeir home, tbat tbe children
were mistaken, inquiry of the parents
showing that the canvassers bad called
and taken the names without the know
edge of the pupils. The figures as verified
and approved by Mr. Webster are as fol
lows: . "..

ENDED HER LIFE
WITH STRYCHNINE
Suicide of Cicelli Podesta.
the Mother of Six
Children.
No Cause for the Woman's
Desperate Deed Is
Known.
Early in th? Evenin; She Was Light-
Hear to J and Happyâ At io Sh;
Was Dead
Mrs. Cicelli Podesta, the mistress of a
comfortable home at 1029 Clay street and
the mother of six children the oldest 14
years of age and the youngest a tiny baby
girl of IS monthsâ committed suicide last
evenin. at 9:30 o'clock by drinking a large
draught of strychnine. The motive
which prompted the deed is a mystery.
Mrs. Pode-Ua returned to her room after
doing some shopping at 6 o'clock in the
evening. Half an hour later her husband,
Antone Podesta, who drives a wagon for
Cavagnaro's winehoase, returned home,
and supper was prepared. During the
course of the meal the woman, according
to Podesta, was in the best of humor, ber
mind apparently being free from any
thought of death.
At 8 o'clock Podesta retired and bis
wile stood on the doorstep conversing
and joking with some friends wbo chanced
to pass. The friends left and Mrs. Po
desta walked into her husband's room.
She carried a glass in her ban J and with
out saying a word raised it to her lips and
drained its contents. She then called to
her husband, who was in bed, and told
him tbat she had taken poison.
Podesta refused to credit the statement
for a snort time. Mrs. Podesta finally
reeled and fell heavily to tba floor, and he
then knew that her statement was true.
He hurried fora physician, but when the
: phytician arrived it was too late.
An antidote administered failed to undo
I the work of the poison, and in half an
j hour the unfortunate woman was dead.
The Coroner's office was then notified,
and the body was removed to the Morgue.
Mr. Podesta is heartbroken over the
death of bis wife, who was but 29 years of
ase, and is at a loss to understand her
strange act.
"My wife haspeen in the best of health
for some time," he said, "and so far as I
know her life has been devoid of trouble.
She never complained or intimated tbat
her life was other tban a happy one, and
that is what mystifies me. We never
quarreled and what could have prompted
tier to leave her babies motherless I will
never know. She must have been tempo
rarily insane."
DE. BARROWS IS HERE.
The Eminent. Divine on His Expe
riences in India, Japan and the
Hawaiian Islands.
The Rev. John Henry Barrows, D.D.,
president uf tbe Parliament of Religions
at the World's Fair, now professional lec
turer on comparative religions at the
Chicago University, and for fifteen years
past pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Chicago, arrived here on the
steamer China yesterday. He has been on
a tour of the world and is now en route
home.
"I delivered 113 lectures in India and
also spoke at forty receptions and crossed
tbe country live times.. traveling over 6000
miles there," said the doctor. "I also de
livered twenty-three lectures in Japan
and one in Honolulu; ' My trip was in
every way very interesting. I found
earnest listeners to the slory of Christ
wherever I was. I was in the famine dis
tricts of India teveral times and witnessed
tbe keen suffering of the people. I spent
some little time in Japan and was quite
taken with that country.
"It was in Hawaii, however, that I
found an almost ideal stale. The people
there show in a magnificent way the
power of Christianity to highly civilize
a people.' 'â ', They jj are . kind, hospitable,
moral and religious. We should by all
means annex Hawaii â not as a State but
as a Territory. If we don't we are fools."

SMITH TO THE
AID OF THE ZOO
The Site of the City and
Connty Hospital Pro
posed.
Supervisors Will Consider It in
Committee of the
Whole.
A Crop of High-Hat Ordinances Ma
turingâ for the Balboa
Eonlevard.
Supervisor Smith has found a way to
provide the City with a zoological garden
that avoids the difficulty that has hereto
fore presented itseii â the City's inability
to purchase real estate. He presented the
following resolution yesterday :
Whereas, It has been made plain to the
Board oi Supervisors during the past thirty
days through the medium of the press,
public meetings and personal interviews with
citizens that a large percentage of our people
favor the early establishment of a zoological
garden or park in the neighborhood of the
Mission, and that it is the duty of this board
to favorably recognize this sentiment in a
manner that wili harmonize with our party
pledges and the powers vested in this body;
and whereas, the Supreme Court has held in
Yon Schmidt vs. Wiober 1.105 Cal., p. 151 1 that
the Board of Supervisors of the City and
County of San Francisco has no authority un
der the consolidation act to. purchase real
estate, and in Smith vs. Broderick (107 Cal.,
p. 044) that each year's * income and
revenue must , pay each year's indebt
edness and liability, and that no
indebtedness and liability incurred in any one
year shall be paid out of the income or rev
enue of any luture year; and whereas, at the
late session of the Legislature an act was
passed conferring power on the Board of Sup
ervisors to lew a special tax for a new City
and County Hospital; and whereas, ln view of
the public sentiment in favor of a park, the
lack of power to purchase land without legis
lative or charter authority, our party pledges
to the people to conduct the government with
in the $1 limit, and special authority irom
the Legislature having been conferred to raise
$300,000 for a new hospital, be it
Resolved, That a site be selected for the new
hospital on that portion of the Almshouse
tract adjoining the new Affiliated College
buildings, thereby making It available to the
students tor clinical purposes. That the four
blocks now occupied by the City and County
Hospital in the southern portion of the Mis
sion be converted into a zoological garden.
That we favor petitioning the next Legislature
for power to purchase land for an additional
park in the northern end of the Mission for
drive purposes.
The matter was referred to the commit
tee of the whole.
The board is threatened with a full crop
of high-hat ordinances. Supervisors
Smith and Cliuion both admitted yes
terday, when a revised Rottanzi effort in
that line was under discussion, that they
had measures in course of preparation
and would present them soon.
Supervisor Rottanzi's latest ordinance
was passed to print by a vote of 8 to 4, but
Supervisor Smith dasn.d the autnor's
hopes by changing his vote and giving
notice that he would move fora reconsid
eration at the next meeting. This bars
the progress of the ordinance until the re
sult of the reconsideration is known.
Tlie board was pledged, by resolution of
Supervisor Delaney, to provide and pay
out of the general fund from the urgent
necessity appropriation tor the next
fiscal year the sum of $300 to defray part
of the cost and expense of the work of
constructing Balboa avenue.
The Auditor was authorized, by resolu
tion, to consolidate the appropriations for
Jails 2 and 3 and the lund for the subsist
ence of prisoners, in order to meet the de
ficiency in the funds oi Jail 3.
Supervisor Devaney, chairman of the
Street Committee, introduced a resolu
tion, that was adopted, requesting the
chief engineer of the fire Departmentand
trie superintendent of the Fire Alarm and
Police Telegraph to investigate and re
port to the board the names of persons
and corporations who have electric poles
with wires suspended, so hat the board
will be able to ascertain whether such
privileges are legally enjoyed.
Supervisor Clinton introduced a resolu
tion providing that in its next annual
statement tne Spring Valley Company
shall give tbe names of ail of its ratepay
ers, alphabetically arranged, with the
amount paid by each.
Supervisor Devaney's resolution, calling
upon the Superintendent of Streets to
furnish a statement of the streets or por
tions of streets upon which are laid street
railroad tracks, and which have not been
required for the operation of the lines dur
ing the past six months, was adopted.
The resolution of Supervisor Britt, pro
viding for the placing of thirty-two new
hydrants, was reported back from the
Jfire Department Committee with a de
duction from thirty-two to sixteen. Su
pervisor Smith wanted to postpone the
placing of any hydrants until the condi
tion of the public funds warrants such ac
tion, and asked that the matter be laid
over. The report of the committee was
adopted.

FEARS A PARIS HORROR.
Mayor Phelan Wants the Fire
Ordinancs Strictly

Chief Sullivan Asked to Report
Whether or Not It I. Obseivrd
tt Present.
Mayor Phelan bas taken alarm at the re
cent holocaust in Paris and will try to see
that all danger of such a catastrophe here
is obviated by haying the tire ordinance j
properly enforced. He addressed the fol- I
lowing letter to Chief Sullivan yesterday:
D, T. Sullivan, . Chief of the Fire Department, j
City Hall, San FrancUcoâ Dear Sir: We are re
minded by the calamity in Paris of the danger
to which our citizens are exposed from fire i:i |
places of amusement, and I call your atten- I
tion to the tire ordinance with respect to the- i
aters, being order 2927 of the Board of Super- '
visors, and particularly to section 50 thereof,
and ask that you report to me whether places
of public amusement have complied with the j
lew.
I am Informed that none of the theaters
have, ior instance, the water curtain, provided
for in the last paragraph of the above section,
which requires a 2}_-inch perforated pipe, or
equivalent equipment of automatic or
open sprinklers, which when in oper
ation shall form a complete' water
curtain for the entire proscenium open
ing, and similar sprinklers placed over
the stage at such intervals ss to protect every
square toot of stage surface when said sprink
lers are in use.
I will make certain recommendations to
morrow to the Fire Department Committee of
the Board of Supervisors, and will rely upon
your valuable co-operation In making further
suggestions and recommendations for fire pro
tection, not only in the theaters but in other
places of public assemblage.. Respectfully,
James D. Phelaj*, Mayor.
The Mayor thinks that the present fire
ordinance is sufficient if. properly en
forced. â â > â¢ V *

ber while Key. William Rader was presi
dent of the club. *.. i I v? i
It is only a week since Mr. Rader was
unanimously elected president, in the ab
sence of Dr. French, and the doctor's ac
tion yesterday was quite unexpected.
"1 desire," he said, "to withdraw from
membership with the Congregational
Monday Club, for by remaining I should
be tacitly indorsing the views on the Scrip
tures held by Mr. Rader, and Ido not
consider his views consistent with evan
gelical Christianity."
The club at once put Dr. French's desire
to withdraw to the vote, and his resigna
tion was accepted unanimously. Speak
ing on the subject afterward a prominent
member of the club said:
"We have warmly indorsed Mr. Rader,
because we recognize his right to do his
own thinking. Congregationalistsdo not
put a padlock on any man's mouth. Mr.
Rader belongs to tne liberal wing of our
denomination, and we intend to uphold
him in thinking lor himself."
The paper of the day at the Congrega
tional Monday Club yesterday was by
Rev. Dr. W. H. G. Temple of Seattle, on
'The Sermon; Its Anticipation and De
livery and Its R flex Influence." In the
absence of the writer it was read by Mr.
Cruzan. . ~
Professor Jefferson spoke to the Chris
tian ministers yesterday on "Comprehen
sive Christianity." A motion was made
to have a Pacific Coast convention of
Christian ministers on July 13, the day
following the close of their great Chris
tian Endeavor convention. Rev. W.
Gardner, Professor Jefferson and Rev. W.
B. Berry were the committee appointed to
make arrangements.'
At ti,e Methodist Ministers' Club yes
terday Rev. Dr. Case read a paper entitled
"What Is the Matter With the Churches?''
An animated discussion followed. Those
who took part were: Rev. Dry. Beaity,
Hammond, Dille, Beard, Jones, Pierce,
Matthews, Urmy, Masters, Simmon,
Briggs and Mine. Mountford.
Dr. Hobbs of Inuia spo&e about the re
lief for tbe famine. He said 2500 tons of
grain were coming here from the East,
and California was wanted to furnish 50u
more tons to make an even 3000, and also
furnish the sacks. A committee of three
consisting of Rev. Drs. Matthews, Urmv
and Harris was appointed to confer with
tbe business men of the City on that sub
ject. .'. '.;".' V-: .'
Rev. Dr. Alexander read a pai>er before
the Presbyterian .Ministerial Union yes
terday on **T c Higher Criticism Tested
by Modern Instances." In a .scholarly
review of the subject tbe doctor upheld
the inspiration of the Scriptures.

ALL ASKING QUESTIONS.
Mrs. Annie Besant Submits Herself for
Two Hours to Seekers After
Information.
A very interested little croup of listen
ers and questioners sat for two hours with
Annie Besant yesterday in the room of the
Tbeosophical Society at Native Sons' Hall.
Mrs. Besant had invited all who wished
to come and she would answer all ques
tions tbat tbey might have in mind or
that they wished to put to her. The drift
of the questions followed the lines of the
lady's lecture of the evening before. The
little group was composed chiefly of
women, although there was a fair sprin
kling of mnn. The questions were all
asked by women.
The idea of reincarnation, the. relation
of the soul to tha body, the relationship of
parents to their own children in the light
of the soul having lived before and having
been unrelated to them in past lives was
what the leader of the new cult was called
upon to explain. The soul, she said,
sought in rebirth the parentage that
would give ita body. and an environment
under which the demands of the sonl,
created in a previous existence, might be
responded to. - .. .'_"; :â 
Mrs. Besant will lecture at Native Sons'
Hall tins afternoon.

THIS IS SCIENTIFIC.
The Combined Testimony of ' Some
Leading* Men of the Age.
What is a cough? It is an irritation of
the throat and lung's. What causes it?
Congestion. Stop the congestion, the irri
tation ceases and the cough is cured.
But how to stop the congestion! Ah,
there is where the physicians have always
been puzzled. Some doctois give cod liver
oil, others cough syrups, but the most
advanced prescribe stimulants. Nature
must be assisted. Pure whisky will do it.
See what physicians say: -
Professor Austin Flint of Bellevue (New
York) College says: "The judicious use
of alcoholic stimulants is one of thestrit
ing characteristics of progress in the prac
tice of medicine during the last half cen
tury/ .â¢ ,
Professor Henry A. Mott of New York
says: "The purity â¢of Duffy's pure malt
whisky (as simple analytical tests will
readily "convince a physician or expert)
should certainly recommend it to the
highest public favor."
Dr. William T. Cutter. State Chemist of
Connecticut, says: "Duffy's pure malt
whisky contains no deleterious or in
jurious qualities, and its absolute purity,
as well as scientific mode of manufacture,
must recommend it to general use and
favor."
Duffy's pure malt whisky is a certain
cure and preventive of congestion. Be
sure and secure the genuine.

Editor Marriott Having a Hard Tim?
â¢ Telling a Jury Why He Crit
/ - icize! a Politician.
Those campaign criticisms on the part
"â¢â¢â¢ of various people which irritated the sen
[ sitive breast of Judge J. CL B. Hebbard to
such an extent as to drive him to an at
tempt to gag any expression of opinion of
political candidates appear to be daily be
coming a source of more worry to him.
The attempt of Editor Marriott to justify
â¢** the opinion he expressed previous to the
election by proving that Hebbard was not
exactly as immaculate a candidate as the
dignity of the bench should exact has de
veloped into an attempt on the part of
the man who is seeking libel redress to
obstruct and shut out evidence by every
possible resort known to law.
" The affairs of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank and the management of it by
John F. Sheehan during his term as re
ceiver are tender spots, which positively
- bring pain to Hebbard's attorneys when
Editor Marriott's attorney, Samuel M.
Shortridge, would probe into them. The
lawyer is, of course, endeavoring to con
vince the jury that Hebbard has a few of
the' frailties common to ordinary mortals,
toputitmild, but the other side will not
have it. When he would convince the i
jury that Marriott was not far wide of the
mark when he declared that Hebbard was
morally responsible for some of the losses
sustained by the depositors of the People's
Home Savings Bank, Judge Daingertield is
. invoked in piteous accents to call a halt.
Thus it is that the case drags along
somewhat slowly. All day yesterday At
torney Shortridge sought to tell the jury
more of the details of the management of
the savings bank, and Hebbard strove
â  just as hard to keep these little matters
irom being related. Now, of course, it
happens that Sheehan, as receiver of the
bank, got the office through Hebbard, and
the latter naturally dislikes to hear any
alleged misdoing of his servant related.
- It was this connection between the two
which led the bank depositors to issue
some campaign literature last October,
which indirectly is responsible for tne
case Judge Daingertield is now listening j
to. . Of course, mixed up in these matters j
there are echoes of the campaign it- j
self. For instance, there is the mci- i
dent of the depositors holding a meeting
- in the Bush-street Theater a few evenings j
previous to election and the attempt on
the part o! Hebbard's friends to break it
up. Then there is the effort of the man,
who was then a candidate for the bench,
effect entrance into the meeting through
the medium of a sergeant of police and
subsequently make a speech. Prior to
tnis there are ot'ier things distasteful to
his bearing if the actions of Hebbard's
attorney to prevent their recital goes
for anything. There is his employment
of a private detective to mollify the angry !
members of the bank depositors' com- j
mittee, the circumstances surrounding \
ins discharge of sheehan in the face of'
the protests of the representative of half j
tbe depositors, his famous injunction re
[training tne old board of directors from !
meeting to resign in conformance with
the request and wishes of the bank de- ,
positors, and there are others.
It is upon these affairs, that Editor Mar- j
riott bases his right to express bis opinion ;
of Hebbard during the last campaign, j
but the candidate is making the way as
rough as possible for tbe newspaper man ;
to accomplish his object.
When me People's Home Savings Bank
failed among the assets was a note of M. :
J. Sherman for $-9,000, secured by other
notes and mortgages on property in I
Arizona. John L. Flournoy,,as one of the
attorneys :or the .bank, was called to re
late how the directors and Sheehan had l
pursued a sort of willy-nilly method of
collecting the money against his protest j
and incidentally to answer the inquiry if ;
Sherman had not got an extension of time !
â¢ upon the payment of a small sum of j
money to the receiver and his attorney, j
Fiournoy was only preparing for a start |
when Attorney Kahu, after consultation j
with his cieni, invoked a campaign of
objection and legal hair-splitting, f j
Attorney Shortridge, in defending bis j
inquiries, replied that he proposed to show j
Fiournoy one piece of evidence of tbe 'â 
conspiracy to gain control of the bank by :
' Sheehan, and which could not bave been
carried out except by the acquiescence of
â¢ Judge Hebbard, who appointed him, and j
subsequently, the lawyer argued, the peo- |
pie that obtained control of the bank pro- j
ceeded to violate their trust. Judge Heb-_ t
bard was aware of acts that brought
this board into being, and the incident
was one of many which led Editor Mar
riott into criticizing Hebbard's qualities
and record as a candidate for Superior .
Judge and accuse him of being "morally
* responsible" for certain losses to the de
positors. Judge Daingerfield thought, how
-ever, that there was some doubt of Heb
â ' bard's knowledge of the affair and Fiour
noy was not allowed to reply. ...
When Attorney Shortridge attempted
â " to elicit from Fiournoy what loss the bank
sustained in the Sherman matter, Heb
. bard's attorneys again interposed. An
attempt to have Fiournoy relate the de
tails of the manner by which Sherman
'â ' secured an extension of his indebtedness
met the same fate.
** We wish." argued Attorney Shortridge,
"to justify Mr. Marriott's expression
of opinion that Hebbard was a disgrace
to the bench, and to that end put facts be
fore the jury to enable them to determine
if Mr. Marriott was correct in his opin
ion We wish to show that Judge Heb
bard was the instrument byiWhich and
without which certain " men. couid * not
Lave accomplished their purposes, and
that any citizen was consequently justified
in oj posing bis candidacy." . - **:
â¢A new tack wa--. taken with equally
fruitless result. Fiournoy was not al
lowed to say that Hebbard's attention
was called to the doings and manipula
tions of Sheehan and . his board of di
rectors and the inquiry was dropped. . -
.It was thought that the list of Heb
bard's court employes who attempted to
â¢lobby that Bosh-street Theater meeting of
bank depositors in his interest had â¢ been
exhausted, but Attorney Shortridge dis
covered anotber one yesterday in the per
son of Harrison O. Jones, Hebbard's court
stenographer. Jones attended the meet
ing, so he said, to get a* shorthand report
of the proceedings, but resented the insin
uation that he was there at his employer's
request. It was a case of disinterested
ness, pure and simple, that led him to use
a bankbook, temporarily left in his posses
sion by a "frifcnd in England." This was
about'the way Jones told his story:
"Who asked you to go there?"
"No one." f'
"How did you get in?"
"Ob, I borrowed a bankbook and went
there." ' " :*..T-r * ' l^'s.m
"You went there to take down the pro
ceedings of gentlemen assembled in a
private meeting?"
. "I thought it was a public meeting."
"If you thought it was a public meeting
why did . yon borrow a passbook to gain j
admittance?" ' ?. : '~
"Well, I was a friend of Judge Hebbard?" |
"You were not a bona fide depositor?"
"No."
"Did you tell Judge Hebbard you were
going?"
"I told him I saw a wagon on the street
advertising the meeting." . -â¢-. a ;
"What time did you get the bankbook
to work your way in on?"
"I think I took it. A young man in
England left one with me."
"You peddled passbooks to others for
that meeting?" ...^
"Yes. I thins I gave one to 'Bob' Fitz
gerald." ? s : -'
"What time did you arrive at the thea
ter?" . . v&Ht
"O.i, I was one of the first to get there.
I sat off to one side." *"^ Â»
"Did you take any part In the meeting? '
"Oh, yes, I got excited enough to vote
several times."
"Vote! What right had you to vote?
"Well, simply as a holder of a pass
book." - .
Jones did not like the remark of Attor
ney Shortridge that "many a man had got
into trouble for attempting to do things
with other men's property." Jones could
not recall if he had consulted with Receiver
Sheehan previous to the meeting.
lt was Police Sergeant Jesse F. Cook
who took upon himself the task of escort
ing Hebbard through the front doors of
the theater despite the remonstrances of
the doorkeeper. The candidate for the
bench it seemed had doubts about the
possibility of his reception at the door of
the depositors' conferences, and he ac
cordingly telephoned from his. political
headquarters to tne California-street sta
tion for assistance. Whether it was a
squad of police be requested or not was
not learned, but Cook, who was doing
duty at the theater doors on that evening,
was* ordered by special messenger from
his lieutenant to report to Hebbard at his
headquarters for duty. It was about 9
o'clock when the candidate and the police
officer met and what followed, according
to Cook, was in this way:
"Where did yon meet Hebbard?"
"In the restaurant under his political
headquarters." .--.â *.>.
"Was there a bar there?"
"No; I think it was a bakery."
"The Judge preceded you into the thea
ter?"
"Yes."
"You pushed the doorkeeper aside and
passed the Judge in."
"I went in quickly and said to the door
keener, 'This is one of the Superior Court
Judges Judge Hebbard.' "
"What business had you to speak and
pass him in?"
"Well, I regard him as my superior offi
i cer. As a police officer lam an officer of
the court." i. -.;.
"He asked you to go to the theater with
him?"
"Yes. I would do the same for any other
police officer." ..Â«;.;
"Would you break into a house if a Su
perior Coun Judge asked you?"
"I di n't break into the meeting. I went
in quietly enough." '
"Did you see a gang follow you in ?"
"I dun remem Der that I did."
"You say you didn't .break -into the
meeting!"
"No."
"\ou knew that onlr those with pass
books were allowed in?"
"I was told that only those with pass
books would be admitted."
"Didn't the doorkeeper ask Judge Heb
bard for a book!" *.-.-:%
--"Yes."' -
"Did he present one?"
"No." \; Â»;;
! "You just pushed your way inâ you ana
! he?" "=&:",â ; -
"I did as he asked me â to escort him
in." There was more of this kind, and
the police officer made way for C. E. Pal
mer, secretary of the bank.
By way of a beginning Palmer declared
that he was unable to discover in the
bank records the correspondence that
passed between Sherman and Receiver
Sheehan concerning ihe former's indebt
edness to the institution. There were
other discrepancies in the bank records,
according to Palmer. He told Attorney
Shortridge that there bad been no item
ized list of the assets since Sheehan had
taken possession of the bank, neither had
the receiver offered any trial balance of
his accounting to the court at the time of
bis discharge, beyond a simple general ac
count of the property that was then in
his charge.
Attorney Shortridge then offered as
evidence the record of the special meet
ing of the stockholders held on July
5, 1894. and thereby stirred up Hebbard's
attorneys to a storm of protests. Judge
Daingerfield inquired in what manner this
record affected Judge Hebbard.
Attorney Shortridge in reply related the
court proceedings, by which Hebbard had
made James Alva Watt the bank's attor
ney at Sheehan's request. "Incidentally,"
continued the attorney, "we wish to
show the manner in which Sheehan and
Watt created a board of directors favora
ble to their own interests. We wish to
show how this meeting was manipulated ;
bow 3000 shares were. not allowed to be
voted. We wish to show that Watt and
Sheehan allowed the Dr. Jenningson stock
to be voted only after they had got control
of Mrs. Jenningson, and that they at that
very time bad an injunction in their
pocket preventing any one else from using
it if it was to be used against their inter
ests, on the ground that the stock was
fraudulently issued, which was true."
To all. these pertinent facts Attorney
Kahn protested frrjm the bottom of bis
heart. Judge Daingertield finally ruled
that the evidence was not admissible inas
much as no definite proof was offered
that Judge Hebbard was aware of the do
ings of the bank directors or stockholders.
# Then Attorney Shortridge attempted. to
get this evidence before the jury by means
of an oral recital of the doings of the
stockholders from the lips of Palmer.
"Was the Jenningson stock voted?" he ,
inquired of the bank secretary.
An objection from Kahn and an adverse
ruling from the court.
"Has that stock been declared fraudu
lent and void?"
Again Kahn successfully interceded
with the court.
"Do you know that an injunction was
issued restraining that stock from being
voted, if any one offered it antagonistic to
Sheehan's interests?" â¢â  : *'- j
Kahn invoked gag law again. Short
ridge again offered the records of both the
stockholders' and directors' meeting, but
Kahn fought vigorously against letting
the jury know what they contained, to the
end that the court decided in bis favor.
Attorney H. W. . Huiton told of, a
conversation he had with Judge Hebbard
in the latter , part of May, 1891, in which
he complained of Receiver Sheehan's talk
ing in the newspapers in a manner de
rogatory to the bank's interests and the
depositors', committee. In one of these
newspaper statements Sheehan had' de
clared' that his influence had been asked
by tbe committee to effect an organization,
of the bank. Hutton had told Heboard
that he thought Bheehan had be ter at
tend to his business. The Judge replied
that he had no control over Sheehan's
tongue, and tbe incident ended at that, as
they. say in diplomacy. ,

called for and could not ba found and
Judge Hebbard himself was put *on the
stand to enlighten the jury ot his employ
ment of Gamage during the campaign.
His replies were shifty and elusive. He
admitted that be knew Gamage, but did
not "employ' him, or at least had never
paid him anything for his services. Sub
sequently Hebbard admitted that imme
diately after Attorney; Shortridge - had
called the detective's name as a witness
he had '" conversed in -private , with
him in the corridor, but had not seen him
since."
Carnage's interview with Benjamin Levy
and other members of the depositors'
committee was done out of pure friend
shin for him, declared Hebbard."
"Is Gamage one of your best friends?"
"I consider him so."
. "Is Detective Curtin in your employ in
this case?"
"No."
"Yon are not paying him any money?"
"No." * â¢â¢- .:Â»; /i;Vpv ; â  * -â â 'â 'â '

"I don't know, unless it was because of

"He's indicted by the United States
Grand Jury?" asked Attorney Bhortridge.
"I don't know tnat he is. I heard you
tried to get him indicted."
"Who told you that?" ;Â«'*â *-"â 
Hebbard replied that it was "somebody,
he could not remember." â¢
Attorney Shortridge challenged him to
produce his informant, but Hebbard got
behind his "Could not remember." ..
Receiver John F. Sheehan had a short
session on the witness-stand, but when
ever a leading question was put to him
Hebbard's attorneys threw themselves in
the way of a reply with all the vigor at
their command. Evidently Sheehan is
one of fortune's favorites and the good
things of life come to him like snow on a
summer day. That $500 a month job he
fell into as receiver of the bank
was a complete surprise to lum; he
never solicited it;' in fad, he never
thought of it until "some one gave
him the slightest intimation" almost a
week before the prize fell into his hands.
The special meeting of the bank stock
holders held on July 5, 1894, resulted
in the election of a board of directors
of Sheehan and Watt's selection.
Sheehan admitted the 3000 shares of stock
issued to Dr. Jenningson in return for a
note of $107,000 were "voted.' ,7 J
"That stock was afterward canceled,
was it not, as fraudulently issued?"
"Yes, I believe so; but wo voted it to
get the McDonald directors out." *
- An attempt to get Sheehan to shed a
little light on the manner in which he
had settled a claim held by the Lower
Kings River Reclamation District resulted
in padlock tactics on the part of Hebbard's
attorney. Similar manuevers shut vii
any information concerning the way the
Kansas City Real Estate Association got
an extension of time on its indebtedness.
A number of questions of like import met
a similar fate, and tho Marriott interests
gave it up as a bad job. The case goes on
this morning. V'f;

remained about six weeks, and one day
departed suddenly, taking with her $260
in coin and some trinkets. '
The case was reported to the police, and
Captain Bohen set his detectives to work
to find tbe girl and arrest her. No. trace
of her could be found. Sunday nieht
Policeman Frank Riley learned that Ida
was wanted, and last night he arrested
her iv a house on Mission street. >v_{;

The residence of Mrs. Clark W. Crocker,
at Octavia and Sutter, was yesterday in a
state of hubbub an a burly burly as would
certainly have caused the demolition of
any bit of gingerbread that might have
been located thereabouts. But cut of that
chaos will rise the .perfectly ordered
Gingerbread Fete, to, be inaugurated to
night and to continue through the week
for the benefit of the Children's Hospital. .
AT THE GINGERBREAD FETE, OCTAVIA AND SUTTER.
The preparations indicate a week of rare >
entertainment, certain to attract such,
crowds of society people as will keep the 1
housÃ full and pile up a large lund for the
benefit of the hospital. All the' lower
part of the handsome big dwelling has
been given over to the entertainment, in
cluding the main floor and the billiard
and other rooms below.
A detail of soldiers from tbe Presidio
was employed yesterday afternoon in
covering the large lawn at the side of the
house â and extending it to and along the
Octavia-street front â with an immense
canvas under which, to-night, a veritable
midway plaisance will be in full play,
Under the glare of electric lights, to the
music of the Presidio band, and the spell

will dance, the snake-charmer will charm,
experts will.- make the real Turkish
candies before the eyes of purchasers,
while tbe crackle and fragrance of pop
corn will fill the air. The tattooed man
and the Circassian beauty will display
their charms, and, Punch and Judy will
parade their incompatibility of temper for
the benefit of the children.
As sine shows to the Midway there will
be a kinetoscope, phonograph, shooting
gallery and a short-range shooting gallery

â¢ Simultaneously with the appearance of
the Epilark, but whether in celebration
of its birth or in sorrow for tbe dead
Lark nobody exactly knows, the staff
of the old publication weNt a- larking in
Oakland, where Mrs. Charles Webb How
ard gave them a dinner. Ail but Bruce
Porter were there. There were s songs be
fore, the soup and speeches before the
roast, and before .the halcyon time was
over Geiett Burgess* was bedecked in
strange skins and crimson robes and pur
: pie thine- in memory of his famous
p Purple Cow.
But coming to the Epilark, it may be
generally described as resembling the
Lark. It contains many good things*
The following explanation by Gelett Bur"
gess is a conspicuous feature .of the issue
at hand:
Had the Lark sought deliberately for a
unique policy to exploitâ a new field un
trampled by the ruck ot the army of the peri
odicals fresher pastures could have been
found than the optimism toward winch It flew
Ingenuously and instinctively, feeling for the
North. That it has traveled steadfastly in this
direc ion is its only reason for existence and
its one claim to serions recognition.
For It has been a decade of small things and
minor poesy and the Lark was too amateurish
an effort to stand for much more than a sin
cerity of impulse. But, though small, it has
been a positive protestâ not iv the debased
meaning oi the word but In its original signifi
cance. It nas protested the joy of lite, the
gladness of youth and love and the belief that
these shall endure. To have struck this note
month bx month (do matter if a little off the
key at limes) is its apology for being. To have
done it gayly with a native and unaffected
spontaneity, is its hope for^remembrance.
But the little spring that we have wattled
overflows Its margent and trickles down into
the brook and joins the river, sweetening and
cooling the eddies of the flood. ; Haply some
careless hand may break the rushes and dis
coveing the fount, cast in a spray of honey
suckle and of mint to be borne down to us
where the stream broadens and flows smooth
and quiet between the fields.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 10.âThe stock mar
ket developed to-day a distinctly better tone than
has been shown for a long time. The Improve
ment was generally attributed to European ad
vices indicating the termination of hostilities.
There was considerable good buying, and as sell
ing was chiefly by traders either to realize profits
or the expectation of a speedy reaction, the con
clusion was reached that bu-.-ing was in the main
better than selling. The prospects that 94,000,
--000 or 95,000.000 in gold will be exported this
weeek had no effect upon the narrow speculation.
Granger stocKs were exceptional)* strong. So
were Chicago Gas, Northern Pacific preferred,
Reading, American tobacco and United States
Leather. The last named two scored the only
noteworthy net gains recorded.
Western Union was not favorably affected by
the decision ot the Supreme i ourt in favor of the
Bell Telephone. The only stocks in which there
were approximately normal dealincs that closed
lower than ou Saturday were Sugar. Refining, Con
solidated Gas and Tennessee Coal and Iron. Gov

San Francisco, May 10, 1897.
Chicago.
Liverpool markets opened steady at Saturday's
prices Frenih markets were not quotable
changed. 7he disposition in wheat at the start
was one of firm -ess. Prices opened at a "Lout Sat
urday's final quotations. Tie first news of Im
portance came in the shape cf a report from the
Indiana State Agricultural. Bureau, giving the
condition of the growing wheat crop at 50 per
cent, against 61 per cent last month. This news
frightened the shoitsand started themtocoverin -.
July, which sold tit 721/gc at the opening, was
wanted at 73c during tbe firs: hour of the session.
Around this price the market hesitated. Offering*
were liberal, causing a mump to 7.3.'g@72V_c, from
where a g-a'lual advance took place.
The visible supply showed a decrease of 2,550.
--000 bushels, the largest during the pr-sent crop
year. Tracers were inclined to look upon the
decrease as a bull sli teature, and cod buying
resulted. July advanced to 73i_c, but reacted to
72%0 at the cioie, under realizing sales ly those
who desired to even up their trades.
< onset vative brokers were inclined to view the
future of whoa, with more favor. ' Stocks are
becoming dangerously low at home and abroad.
Unless present indications change ma erially, the
visible supply on July 1 will notexcetd 12,000,000

The Government report due this afternoon
kept traders thin narrow limits, many prefer

than ou any previous day.
'Ihe weather man whs not willing to forecast
rain for a day or two, if then. Some ariue rain at
this time would completely ruin the wheat crop.
This may or may no; be so. Much would de end

Disastrous Fire at Thir
"â¢;â '. teenth and Jackson

Edson Adams, Henry B. Hough
ton and G. W. Baker Suffer
Great Losses.
The Fames Were Discovered In a
Stable by Youi:g Lads While
Pii-iy-nS Tennis.
â 
- Oak! Office Bah Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 10. \
- Several lads playing tennis at half-past
".-this afternoon saw flames issuing from a
stable at Thirteenth and Madison streets,
and before they were subdued the dam
ages amounted to about $50,000 and two
of the finest homes . in the fashionable
part of Oakland were in ruins.
The fire which proved so disastrous
started in a mysterious manner in a stable
in the rear of the house occupied by Edson
Adams.
Percy Gaskill and George Gage, son of
Stephen T. Gage, were in' the tennis
court and as soon as they saw the flames
they gave an alarm.
There was considerable delay in turning
in the alarm from box 9, at Twelfth and
Madison streets, which was one block
from the lire, and in this interval the
blaze spread rapidly.
When the department arrived there was
a*big fire to handle. The flames ate their
way into tho Houghton residence to the
west of the stables and into the Baker
residence on the east at the same time.
There were two* other stables besides the
one where the fire started and ihe flames
soon spread 10 them both.
The horses were led out and the carriages
taken to a place of safety. It was soon
seen that the fire was beyond control, so a
second alarm was turned in. By the time
the extra engines arrived a breeze sprang
up and other buildings were threatened
by the sparks. .v'-.p r
Twenty minutes after the first alarm
was rung in, a general alarm was sounded,
and every engine in the department was
on the sceneâ and so was half of Oakland.
The chemical engine which arrived first
succeeded in putting out the fire in the
Houghton residence, but before water
could bf got to it the flumes broke out
afresh. For over an hour the fight was a
stubborn one, and the flames seemed to
have a hold of the large gabled roof that
cemld not be located or quenched.
Wben the Houghton house was com
pletely ruined it was hoped that the Baker
House would be saved, but suddenly flames
shot out from half a dozen places in the
roof at once, and not until it was de
stroyed and the house gutted was the fire
under control.
The firemen fought well, and frequently
the crowd cheered some especially brave
conduct.
The bouses are of three stories and all
the active work bad to be done from lad
ders and window-sills in the midst of
dense smoke. To add to their discomfort,
it was necessary to fight the tire from
leeward, as the breeze from the westward
sent flames and smoke and cinders and
water in the firemen's faces.
There were several minor accidents and I
a few burns were dressed on the spot, but i
no serious accident was reported.
When it was seen that the residences I
were doomed scores of people helped to '
carry the furniture to a place of safety. i
Much of it was saved, but the damage is '
very heavy as so much was smashed and j
ruined by smoke and water and fire.
Much valuable bric-a-brac was destroyed, j
and as the houses were two of the most
luxuriously furnished in the city the j
damage will be very large.
George W. Baker, his wife and Miss !
Irene Baker are at present at Honolulu â¢
and the two son*, Harry and Ray, are !
living at the house alone. They "found i
plenty off riends, however, in their efforts j
to save everything possible, and although '
some of the carpets and heaviest furniture j
could not well be handled in a hurry
everything portable was carried out, I
especially things prized by the family.
W. E. Dargie mustered all his clerks
and reporter- and personally directed the
work of salving in the Baker residence,
and his brigade did not stop till smoke
and water made farther work impossible.
The prooable loss is: Houghton resi- j
dence, $20,000; Baker residence, owned by
Mr. Swift, $8000; furniture, $3000; stable. !
$2000. Total, $33,000.
THE OPERA-HOUSE EIRE.
No Light on Its Originâ Heavy "Loss of |
- a Performer.
Â ALAMEDA, Cal., May 10.â -There are I
no new developments with iegard to the !
opera-house fire. The cause remains as '
much a mystery as ever. It is thought a j
leaky gas jet may have had something to i
do with starting the flames, and it is also !
suggested that a lot of greasy rags used
for cleaning wheels in the cyclery -may
have played a part in the origin of the j
hre. But i . will be difficult to learn the j
exact cause the destruction was so com
. piete. It now appears tbat the delay in |
getting water on the flames at flrstwas
caused by a disarrangement of the hydrant
from attaching hose to it at first and then
removing it to give place to the engine.
Some of the packing became disarranged !
and it took quite a while to remove it, j
while in the meantime the flames were |
rapidly spreading.
The heaviest individual loser next to !
Mr. Lindermnn himself is Zera Stmon,
who had just concluded a three; days' en- '
gagement at the theater and had all his j
effects end properties packed up ready for '
removal. Not a thing was saved, even his I
clothes sharing tie common fate. He
had Deen many years in making his collec- j
tion of sleigh l o -hand machinery, etc., I
and says tbat $2000 would not cover their
value. Indeed, much of it cannot be ie- !
placed. ;..â â  i.;. .â 
It is not considered likely that Mr. Lin- ,
derman will rebuild, and a!r:?ndy there is !
talk about putting up another building of j
a more substantial character for theatri- !
cal purposes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 11, 1897.
DEATH OF PIONEER
JUSTUS GADING
Farmed Forty Years at
Mount Eden and Died a
Rich Man.
Lived Out His Theory That
Farming Is a fa'er Invest
ment Than Mining.
The Homestead Has Been Managed
Profi ably by Three Succes
sive Generations.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 10. f
Justus Gading.a pioneer of Mount Eden,
died yesterday at his home, after a resi
dence in this county of forty-two years.
Mr. Gading was one of the most success
ful farmers of this county, and died a com
paratively rich man.- He was an ardent
advocate of the theory that farming can
be made to pay and pay well if a farm be
handled in a business-like manner, and
JUSTUS GADING, Who Devoted His Life to Farming and
Died Rich.
' his theory, after being ably tested by him
i self, was found to be eminently successful.
On New Year's day, 1835, Justus Gading
was born at Bremen, and for a few years
I he worked as a printer; afterward went to
; sea for a year or two along the coast of
; Europe and served for a short time on a
I German man-of-war.
When he was but 20 years of age he
j came with his parents around Cape Horn
jto California. They arrived here in 1855,
j and after a very short stay in San Fran
j cisco they settled at Mount Eden, ac
. quired a moderate-sized ranch, and the
family has lived there ever since. Many
years ago young Justus became imbued
| with the gold fever, but a very short ex
; perience at the mines convinced him that
! there was more in farming than in min
ing, and after two months' experience he
returned to the Alameda County ranch.
Anxious to start in business on his own
account, he located on a farm in San
Lorenzo, but one year was sufficient to
convince him that be could do better on
the old homestead, so he returned to the
' Gading ranch and has made bis home
I there ever since. JJ J\ ,;-.'â '
Several years ago he married Miss
; Catherine Fo.te, and their two children
i are now living on the ranch.
A few months ago Gading began to feel
! the effects of old age and was stricken
' down with sickness. He gradually be
| came worse and for several weeks his
I death has been expected.
Nine years ago, in company with his
I wife, he visited the scene of his boyhood,
l and feeling that he was breaking up, he
repeated the visit three years ago, on
I which occasion -he was accompanied by
his daughter. His estate is large and in
! good shape, and his son is thoroughly
i qualified to carry on the old homestead,
| which has now been tie abode of three
! generations. The estimated value of the
I property is about $200,000.
MURDER IS EXPECTED.
Three Outbreaks Hay, Now Oc
curred Between the Ama
dors and Gal legos. '":}_.
If Threats Amount to Anything There
Will Soon Be B oodshed in
Pieasanton.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,!
908 Broadway, May 10. f
It will probably not be long before
there. Is a murder or two at Pieasanton.
Ti.e Amadors and the Gallegos have
fallen out and declared war, and as they
are both of a belligerent nature blood is
likely to ; flow. . :'?->*.- A-'J-'J-M.^''^
Mrs. Amador recently, it is alleged,
quarreled with her neighbor, Frank Gal
legos, and soon after the quarrel Gallegos
was shot, but not badly, oy some one on
Mrs. Amador's premises. As near as
could be ascertained, the shot came
through a knothole in a big fence between 'â 
the two properties. Mrs. Amador, of I
course, could not be seen by Gallegos, but j
witnesses asserted that she was near her
side ot the knothole when the shot was
fired. In .court the . case against the !
woman was considered strong enough, to
bold her over to answer for an attempt to j
murder.
Since the examination war has twice
broken out again. The witnesses in the
case met and had an excitable time on
the street. Hostile action was only pre
vented by the J arrest 'of Mrs. Â» Amador.
Antone H. Bernel, a witness opposed to
her, caused : her arrest : and charged her
with disturbing the peace. Mrs. Amador
â¢wore at him and precipitated the quarrel
by stopping a spring wagon in which she
was driving and showering all manner of
abuse on him, while some of her friends
applauded and some of Bernel's took his
part and all seemed anxious ior a mix-up.
The arrest i f the lady, however, restored
order. She at once pleaded not guilty,
and after a short trial was acquitted.
While the trial was in progress Gallegos,
the prosecuting witness, was having
trouble with Joe; Beinel, who is also in
terested in the case. The two men were
making all kinds of dire threats, and the
bystander** expected to see a tragedy, but
the Marshal came along, Gallegos secured
Bernel's arrest, they were all marched
into court, Bernel pleaded guilty of dis
turbing Gallegos' peace and paid his fine.
As he walked out ol court he declared he
would have revenge. Gallegos also de
clares he ia out to be revenged or. all his
enemies. Mrs. Amador has indicated the
manner in which her revengeful spirit
manifests itself. Antone Bernel also wants
satisfaction, and as I'ieasanton is a small
.place and some of the opposine factions
are bound to rub shoulder* with each other
a few, times a day the Marshal has pre
pared himself for the worst.'
A feeling oi intense bitterness exists be
tween the two factions, and on account of
the , numerous arrests and the felony
charge hanging over Mrs. Amador an out
break is hourly expected. ; -. < * .

MAY GET THE MEDAL.
Four Students at Barkele/ Vie
for the Scho'arship
Award.
A- G Van Girder of Loj Angeles Is
Thought to Hold the Highest.
Cast Ranking.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 10.â As com
mencement day at the State University
draws nigh, speculation is rife as to which
one of the 140 students in the class will be
awarded the regents' gold medal for
scholarship. The prize, which is awarded
annually to the "most distinguished stu
dent in the class," seems certain of going
to one of four persons whom the seniors
have picked out as holding the highest
ranking. Though no one wiil know defi
nitely to whom the meJal will go until
the meeting of the regents on Wednesday
morning, it Is quite certain that their
-â¢election will be made from either A. G.
Van Gorder, Miss Adele Schwarzchild,
Frank Tade or Charles Elston.
The cdds seem to be in favor of Van
Goider, it being the general belief that he
has scored more "first sections" than any
other '97 "grad." The fact that he was
oat of college for two years and is not a
regular member of the class of '97 seems,
however, to militate against his chances
for the golden prize. He entered as a '99
man, was away for two years and returned
last year. While absent from Berkeley he
made up a portion of the prÂ«scribed work,
and will graduate after only three years'
actual attendance at the university. This
fact may be viewed by the faculty an mak
ing up for having been absent for a year,
though in past years a failure to remain
in college continuously has lost the medal
to the student. vv;V.
Miss Schwarzcbild has taken the course
in mathematics, which is generally con
sidered to be the most .difficult of all at
Berkeley, and her achieving such a high
ranking as to entitle her to consideration
among the first four students in the class,
is looked upon as no small achievement.
If the medal goes to her it will be the
first time a student electing such a group
of studies has won the honor. Frank
Tade ana Charles Elston both hold high
ranking, but their chances are not con
sidered as favorable as those of Van Gor
der and Miss Schwarzcbild. Van Gorder
is enrolled in, the y college of .*: natural
sciences, and comes from Los Angeles:
Miss Schwarzcbild is in the college of social
sciences and lives In San Francisco; Tane
comes from Sacramento and has been pur
suing work in the college of letters, while
Elston has been in the college of social
sciences and hails from Woodland.

HAPPY RESULT OF
A LITTLE STORY
Don Soberanes Will Not
Die a Blind Pauper in
an Almshouse.,
Found by His Sister, Whom He
He Had Not Seen ior Over
1 Twenty Years.
Half a Century Ago His Family Wer*
the Largest Land-Owners in
Southern California.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 10. J
Don Feliciono Soberanes will not die in
the County Almshouse. The once proud
and wealthy Spaniard, who bad come to
the point where he is blind and was starv
ing, and who asked to be shown the way
to the water that he might end his mis
pry, has been found by his sister. And all
this happiness has been caused by the
little story of the old man's trouble pub
lished in The Call last Saturday.
The old man was at the County Infirm
ary to-day and, to his great surprise, his
long-lost sister called on him and, al
though he could not see her, he had the
pleasure of embracing her after twenty
years of separation.
Mrs. Anita Shaw of 1314 Tenth street,
who has lived in Oakland for the past six
years, is the widow of the late Dr. Shaw.
She was born on the A. La Salle rancho
near Monterey. On leading The Call
Saturday evening she noticed the name of
Soberanes and at once recognized in it her
lost brother. ; 'v r v
Early this morning she applied to
Supervisor Mitchell to learn more of the
man and his whereabouts. On being told
she repaired at once to the infirmary and
spent four or five hours in conversation
with her brother.
"My hopes are that I can have his eyes
treated," said Mrs. Shaw, "and then get
nim into the blind asylum. I have noth
ing compared to what I formerly hnd, but
shall take â > ood care of my brother. Our
parents came of the nobles of Spanish and
French society. Governor Pacheco and
all of the earlier settlers of this State knew
my brother and our family. . \
â¢'lt was through reading The Call that
I learned of my brother's present condi
tion."
f'eliclono Soberanes is proud of his his
tory. He comes of the very oldest and
wealthiest Spanish families of the pioneer
days.
"I was born in Monterey County, tear
the present site of that city, In November,
1826." if aid he this afternoon, as he sat -in
the office of the County Infirmary. "My
two brothers entered the army at the
breaking outof the Mexican War and soon
alter I followed, although only 18 years of
age. I was soon compelled to return, ow
ing to my father's serious illness.
"Father and mother were both horn in
Spain, but came to Mexico about 1800.
He did not remain there Ion?, but soon
came to California, where he acquired im
mense land estates. The San Lorenzo
.rant, now King City, was all his. Buena
Vista grant was another; the A. La
Salle, and Gilroy rancho all belonged to
him at one time.
"It was in '63 and '64 that misfortune
began to overtake us. The rains were
light, which caused a failure of the crops.
Ten thousand sheep and thousands of
heads of horses and cattle were lost in
those two years. Taxes and lawyers got
what was left and we had nothing.
"I have been all around since, and finally
landed in Los Angeles, where I asked to
have my eyes treated. I believe it is a
cataract* but I am blind all but a little
light that comes in through one eye. Tbe
Supervisors there sent me to the in
firmary, but after being treating there for
sometime 1 became discouraged. I knew I
bad a sister in Oakland. I thought if I
could get here, perhaps she could help
me. I applied to the Supervisors, but
they refused at first, but when I told the
doctor my sister might be able to pay my
ease- be recommended that they send
me here. *. .â-'./ ..
"1 came here and at once sought the
City Directory, but was dismayed to find
no si' of her name in it. It was then
that I became discouraged and wanted to
get out of this world, for there was noth
ing for me.
"My father paid more money for taxes
to build the blind asylum and other State
institutions than any other man ever did,
and when one of his children wants ad
mission to the asylum to have his eyes
treated it is denied him. This is, indeed,
a hard lot. lam the only applicant from
Monterey County, and yet I must wait
until forty-five others are out of the way."

RICHMOND
PROTESTS
Her Representatives De
mand the Removal of
the City Cemetery.
STRONG RESOLUTIONS
ADOPTED.
To Prevent the Spreading Broad
cast of Contagious Dis
eases.
REASONS THAT CAM NOT B^
GAINSAID.
Executive Committee of tha Improve
ment Association Appeal to
the Supervisors-
At a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Richmond District Improve
ment Association the lollowing resolu
tions, etc., were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, The time has come for action in
removing irom this County the City cemetery,
the great barrier to its further progress and
the breeding spot for contagious diseases,
which fact prevents many persons from Duild
ing and improving, as it is well known that
Chinese, paupers and all who die of con
tagious diseases, such as smallpox, leprosy,
etc., are here interred, and it is also a fact that
the clothing of the Chinese dead, no matter
what the cause of death has been, if of any
value, is tept by the cemetery employes and
sold or given away to junk-dealers and others,
aDd many of the blankets are now used by
teamsters and others for horse blan
kets, which are thoroughly saturated
with germs of the most loathsome dis
eases, thereby spreading disease through
out the City and lew know how it is caused to
be spread; and lurther, this cemetery lies
just west of Richmond and the winds from the
ocean blow direct from this pest-breeding
spot, carrying its deadly germs over ail the
homes of citizens, thereby endangering the
lives of over 300,000 persons, the half of which
has never been told. It is an appalling and
fearful state of things to be at.o wed to exist in a
civilized city like San Francisco, and should
be abated at once; ana whereas, as the lives
of our children ana families demand it at our
hands, and' as tne State Board of Health,
as also the Board of Health 01 the
City and County of San Francisco
did both unanimously declare in
1895 that the burial of the dead in the City
cemetery was dangerous to life, and the city
government has no moral right to maintain a
nuisance dangerous to life and detrimental to
public health, more especially when the law
provides a remedy, and an exchange 'can be
made for lands outside of the City on such
terms as would provide ample funds for remov
al of all bodies thereto and also leave a hand
some surplus for the City. The City cemetery,
this disease-breeding incubator, consists of
150 acres, commanding the most beautiful
aud grand view of the Golden Gate and en
trance to the harbor, a marine view that can
not be surpassed. Also the folly of longer
continuing the temporary burial of more
bodies, which must be removed at great ex
pense, sooner or later, is self-evident; also the
barbarous practice of scraping the flesn from
ths bones of the dead Chinese, which is ob
noxious to the eyes of a civilized community,
and prevailing winds carry microbes of in
fectious diseases broadcast throughout our
city, and as the presence of this cemetery de
preciates the value of "and over a large area,
tuis depreciation entailing the loss to the
City of over a quarter of a million dollars an
nually in taxes on the property thus affected ;
and whereas, the Board of Supervisors is em
powered under the law to exchange for other
property, under the provisions of the thirty
fifth supplement to the consolidation act of
tne City and County of San Francisco, con
firmed by tne statutes of this State during the
session of the Legislature in 1867-68; there
fore, be it
Resolved, That we petition the Honorable the
Board of Supervisors of the City and county
of San Francisco to immediately exchange
the City cemetery for property outside this
County, and prepare the acquired land for
burial purposes and have all bodies removed
thereto; and that we also earnestly petition
the honorable the Board of Health for their
co-operation in this important matter.
C. H. Hcbbs, President.
J. S. Malo-TET, Secretary.
It was decided to call a mass-meeting
of property and others in the West
ern Addition, to advocate this matter, on
Wednesday evening, May 19, when emi
nent speakers will address the meeting.
TO BOOM BUILDING TEADES.
Union Carpenters Holding Monthly
Meetings for Mutual Benefit.
The carpenters' unions of this City are
holding a series of monthly meetings
open to the public. The object is to ex
cite among the outside members of the
craft a keener interest in the cause of or
ganized labor, with a view to bettering
the conditions of tbe trade. The first of
these meetings was held last evening at
1159 Mission street, under the auspices of
Carpenters' and Joiners' Union No. 304.
The attendance was very large and ad
dresses were delivered in tbe English and
German languages. The speakers were P.
ii. McCarthy of No. 22, Henry Warnecke,
P. Ross Martin, Mr. Hutchings ex-presi
dent of No. 483, Henry Behnke of No. 304
and others. Next month the meeting wil.
he held under the auspices of No. 483, and
No. 22 will follow. The third month's
gathering will be under the auspices of
the Italian Carpenters' Union No. 95.
A meeting of the Sandstone-cutters'
Union was neld last evening and it was
reported that business is very dull at pres
ent. A delegation from the Building
Trades Council was received. The mis
sion of this committee was to induce the
union to affiliate with the council. It is
likely that representatives will be sent to
the council.

WORTH A HALF MILLION.
W. B. Carr Had His Business
Affairs in Excellent
Shap..
A Complete Settlement Was Made
With Haggin and Tevis Two
Years Ago.
Prrominent men of San Francisco who
were intimately acquainted with W. B.
Carr do not entertain for a moment the
idea that his death was other than acci
dental. Speaking of Mr. Carr's business
affairs yesterday M. M. Estee remarked:
"You can make the statement public as
coming from me that Mr. Carr did not
owe, all told, $5000. He had an appoint
ment to meet me to-day and secure $4000
on a business transaction. He owned val
uable land and lots, unincumbered, and
was not in any sense financially embar
rassed. People who knew Mr. Carr inti
mately knew him to be a man of his
word â a man of honor and strict integ
rity. I knew him well for forty years.
"Yes, he made Mr. Sargent United
States Senator in 1872. I was secretary
of the Republican State Committee that
year when Newton Booth ran for Gov
ernor. It was understood in that cam
paign that Booth should be Governor and
Sargent United States Senator. No agree
ment of that Kind was made, but that was
the understanding and the campaign was
conducted on that line. Booth was
elected by the voters of the Slate, and
when the Legislature convened Sargent
was elected to the Senate. Carr managed
the Senatorial campaign in a masterly
manner.
â¢'Mr. Carr did not take an active part
in the contest at Sacramento when Gov
ernor Stanford defeated Mr. Sargent for
the United States Senate. Mr. Carr did
not take much interest in the framing of
the new constitution in 1879. He made
some suggestions, but they were not car
ried out. Subject! pertaining to irriga
tion called him to Sacramento frequently
during the session of the Legislature of
1895."
Another lawyer of this City who was
reckoned as one of Mr. Carr's close friends
predicted yesterday that the Carr estate,
when probated, would approximate $500,
--000. Commenting on the Kern County
land investments, he said: <*
"The interests of Haggin, Tevis and
Carr in Kern and Kings counties were
enormous. The property at one time
was valued at $15,000,000. There were
twenty-seven immense ranches, each em
bracing so many thousands of acres that I
dare not give figures. In 1895 Carr had a
settlement or segregation of interests with
his partners, lias-gin and Tevis. He re
ceived then some money and lands, and
after that settlement conducted his enter
prises on his own account. I know that
he regarded himself as released from the
activities and vexations of business, and
he told me that he was planning to enjoy
life, as his aifaiis were in such shape he
could take a rest. He seemed to be as
happy as a bird."
Funeral ceremonies over the body of
Mr. Carr will take place to-day. Among
the pa! l- bearers selected are: M. M.
Estee, W. W. Foote. Smith Brown, E. A.
Heacock and Mr. Drumm.
The directors of the San Francisco Soro
sis met yesterday and appointed a com
mittee to prepare resolutions expressing
the sympathy of the society with Mrs. W.
B. Carr in her bereavement.
The committee was composed of Mrs.
George J. Buck-nail, Mrs. John Conness
Jr., Mrs. M. If. Estee, Mrs. Irving M.
Scott and Mrs. George Law Smith.
DEINK DROVE HIM OEAZY.
An Unknown Colored Man Assaulted a
Citizen and la Arrested.
A big colored man is being detai ned in
the padded cells for the insane at the City
Receiving Hosoital. No one knows who
he is or whence he came, but his actions
have been such during the past twenty
four hours as to make him a proper person
to be held under strict surveillance. -
Officer W. P. Dslton of the Seventeenth
street station was called to the home of
Jonn Leonard, at Sixteenth and Caroline
streets, at an early hour yesterday.
Mr. Leonard, accompanied by his wife,
had been attracted by noise in the back
yard, and when they investigated they
were met by the colored man, who imme
diately showed battle.
Leonard was hardly a match for his as
sailant, but Mrs. Leonard went to the res
cue witn what was left of hot water in the
kettle on the stove.
Tbe colored man surrendered under the
scorching and submitted quietly to the
policeman who had come in auswer to the
cries for help. -
The prisoner has been booked on
charges of drunkenness and disturbing
the peace.

The benefit performance to be given at the
Baldwin Theater on Thursday afternoon, May

GIVING MEDALS
IN THE SCHOOLS
They Lead to Political Con
nubiation, Says Mr.
Faulkner.
Teachers Discuss the Philosophy
of Gauging Merit Deci
mally.
Superintendent Webster Favors Re
turning to the System of
Medals and Reports.
"Rewards and Ranking in the Public
Schools as a Means of Encouraging Good
Work and Deportment" was the subject
of a talk last night before the San Fran
cisco Teachers' Club by R. Webster,
Superintendent of City Schools.
The subject was all the more interesting
because* of the fact that the retiring Board
of Education had made a rule that no
medals should be awarded in the schools
this year, the board having been impelled
to tbat action by the request of a large
majority of the school principals.
The abolition of rewards, marks and
ranking in schools had been suggested by
many teachers, while others earnestly ad
vocated the continuation â â  of the system,
said Mr. Webster. One of the principal
objections to the system was that stud
ents worked for marks snd rank rather
than for learning. But the speaker con
tended that this objection was trivial and
without any logical foundation; for
whether a student studies for the I marks
or the knowledge he certainly cannot
gain one witbout the other. The practice
had been to multiply scholarships and re
wards in the universities, it having been
found that they acted as a salutary stimu
lus.
By a system of credits or grades a pupil's
work was kept under strict, observance
and a check was imposed upon idleness or
bad, behavior. There was no doubt that
such checks were needed. To determine
the fitness of a pupil for promotion to a
higher grade it would be necessary to be
guided by the credits gained by the pupil
in tbe grade in which he might be at the
time. It stimulated effort, because there
was competition; it checked egotism and
made the pupil ambitious and self-reliant.
It was this competition and rivalry which
developed .. such men as Demosthenes,
Cicero and Daniel Webster. By it, men
were measuring their strength in : the
arena of thought, and .by it they are
spurred onward to greater effort.
It was now proposed to abolish this sys
tem of credits and rewards which kept
alive enthusiasm, and by which the pupil
gauged bis progress in his studies. ; pi,
It had been argued, he said, that pupils
should study for the love of study, but it
was not natural that they should. Cred
its and rewards inspired them to acquire
the habit of study, which they took with
them into life as tbey grew older. Study
for the . love of study could not be incul
cated in the mind of the pupil. The most
eminent educators in the country had de
clared that percentages and rewards were
necessary ' to -Jj- induce pupils to .*'â¢ study.
Therefore the system should be continued
and encouraged. .
i" Silas A. .White asked whether Mr. Web
ster had not found it difficult to keep the
record of proficiency of pupils *in recita
tions or oral work, and Mr. Webster ' re
plied that he did not use figures, but made
private marks in the corners of little
squares in the register used by him.
Mr. White called up . the subject of the
announcement by tbe Board of Education
that no more medals should be given out,
and of the doing away with the monthly
reports to parents. Since those two
changes, he found that his pupils were
losing interest in the work and were fall
ing behind. He never had so poor a class
before.
Mrs. Woods took issue with the position
of the last speaker. She had found by ex
periment that the abolition of the credit
system was productive of much improve
ment in the class. The pupils were not
envious or jealous of one another, and
they got into the habit of asking ques
tions of the teachers, wnich thÂ«y would
not do if credits were given.
Two other lady teachers said that they
had abolished the credit system and had
put the pupils on honor. They were
taught to attend to their studies as a mat
ter of duty.
Miss Connell was of the opinion that
without credits the pupils would not know
whether they had been doing well or
poorly.
Miss Hodgkinson told how she had
heard Professor David Starr Jordan tell of
nature's bribes. For instance, nature be
stowed an appetite in order to bribe peo
ple to eat. Now, if nature offered bribes,
why should not teachers offer the same in
they way of credits and rant and promo
tions? she asked.
The question was greeted with applause.
Miss Conklin spoke against tbe working
of percentages as closely as 91, 92 aud 93.
Her idea was to rate those pupils who had
gained over a certain per cent as "excel
lent" and those who had not attained to a
certain minimum percentage as "poor."
Thus the best as well as the poorest pupils
would not stand alone and would not feel
their position so keenly as they would un
der tbe old system of percentages,
Richard D. Faulkner, principal of the
Franklin Grammar School, said that he
was sorry to see that the Superintendent
and many of the ladies present ware
directly opposed to him in his attitude
toward the system of marking credits, an
attitude which he had maintained ever
since he graduated from the Illinois Uni
versity twenty years ago. His son, who
was going to the Lincoln School, had
brought home a report-card naming him
as No. 1, and his boy wai very proud of
it, but he, the father", knew that the boy
was not No. lin many things, and the
report-card was meaningless to him. He
would rather know how his boy would
stack up alongside of the rough-and
tumble boys and how he would turn out
twenty years from now.
, He had charge of a night school in this
City a short time ago, and he sent report
cards to the parents every day. Some of
these reports announced that the pupils
whose names they bore had been absent
on the evening before, and ; that he had
seen them on a corner smoking cigar
ettes. Then be would ask the parents to
help him, and they would do so.
The consensus of opinion among the
most prominent educators in the United
States was against those who ;*-: supported
the system of rewards and credits. Pu
pils don't need to ; be marked: down* and
they should not be ! given medals. He
added: aaafa^.^-i'^^
"Some of the most disreputable things
that have ever happened in this City have
been in connection with: the medalsâpo
litical connubiation and - other disrepu
table , practices. p These .% medals i caused
much hard feelings, and placed the prin
cipals in an uncomfortable position."
Mrs. L. K. Burke said that notwith
standing Mr.' Faulkner's 'assertions JJ he
seemed to follow the same .system as the
rest of the teachers. lie might have sent
more notes to the parents concerning the
conduct of the pupils and he ; might not
have sent reports -of' their standing so
often as other teachers did, but his prac
tice was about the same as that of the rest
of the teachers. -" *.â¢.,': ''^&_^kW_^s_^_fS^
Professor M. E. Blanchard said that the
extremes in the dispute seemed to Â« be ; be
tween a decimal system of grading and a
more general system of : rating. : He â¢ did
not think it possible ;to : rate '-. intellectual
ability .r mathematically. &: It j consumed
time and did not decide very much after
all. Grown people are not rated that way, 5
JUDGE MAGUIRE
IS HOME AGAIN
The Postoffice Likely to
Materialize in the Near
Future.
He Is by No Means so Sanguine
About the San Pedro
Harbor.
The Tar ff Bill Will Scarcely Be
Adopt, dÃe fore the Middle
of Jay.
Hon. James G. Maguire arrived home
ast night direct from Washington and at
the end of the swiftest journey he has ever
made across the continent. There met
him at Sixteenth street in Oakland quite
a delegation of his friends, among them
Joseph Leggett, Registrar Hinton, J. L.
Gallagher, W. D. Joyce, his brother, E. H.
Maguire, and his sisters.
Judge Maguire was in the best of spirits
and reported himself to be in excellent
health and very glad to get borne again.
Those things at Washington that interest
him have been accomplished or are in a
position beyond his help, and he, there
fore, felt privileged to come home.
] "I think the tariff * bill will not get
through the Senate earlier than the first
week in July," said Mr. Maguire last even
ing in a brief interview.
"The fight on . the " tariff between the
East and West has been very sharp, but I
believe the bill which may be passed by
the Senate will be speedily adopted by the
House."
Speaking of the Postoffice matter Judge
Maguire said : "I understand that the sole
occasion for delay in this business arises
from the delay of the engineers of the
War Department in filing their report with
the Secretary of the Treasury. That, how
ever, has been done, and there is now no
further reason for postponing the begin
ning of ; work. The fact that the tenants
on the pronerty have been given notice to
vacate indicates jat least i that there 4is
nothing in the re-examination of the site
recently made by engineers to justify a
rejection of that site. Therefore, as there
is no good reason for delaying the work,
we v may reasonably hope that it will be
speedily inaugurated, and that the build
ing itself may at last become a fact rather
than a dream." â -'. -.*â 'â :*,
.With regard :to the : San , Pedro harbor
Judge Maguire was not in , a . sanguine
mood. :He said Secretary Alger is dis
posed to bold off, despite all the needs of
the * case that . have been represented to
bim and the influence that has been
brought to bear by the people of the State.
..â¢'The Secretary of War.'.', said ', Mr.' Ma- 1
quire, "is disposed to refer the whole mat
ter back to Congress on the ground that
the appropriation already made will i not
complete the work. As you know, a pro
vision' was made for 'the expenditure of
$2,900,000; to construct a :, breakwater.
Southern 'Pacific engineers have repre
sented to the Secretary that the work can
not be done for a less cost than : $5,000,000,
and that representation has been made a
pretext for delay. At ?. first 'i it was I said
that General Alger had I discretion 'i in the
matter, as the language of - the bill used
the word 'may' Secretary 'may,' in
stead of 5 'shall,' ?, proceed. -It became 1 so"
manifest that this interpretation and -the
reference back to Congress under it would
defeat the whole intent of the bill th-it it
has been abandoned and is no longer
urged. Now, as I say, the Secretary is
standing exclusively in his objection on
the ground that the money provided will
not complete th*Â» work, wbil* the assur
ances of the engineers are to the effect
that the work can be done for the sum
provided. Just how long this may stand
as an excuss for doing no wore at all is
uncertain."
Governor Budd and Attorney-General
Fitzgerald came down from Sacramento
on the same train with Judge Maguire.
ROLLED DOWNSTAIRS.
Mrs. Keating of Tennessee Street Hal a
Fortunate Escape From Seri
ous Injury.
Mrs. Keating, 1106 Tennessee street, had
a narrow escape from death yesterday aft
ernoon, and as it is she is nursing a
sprained wrist and ankle.
She lives in the upper flat, and about 1
o'clock was standing on the porch in the
rear hanging out some heavy clothes on a
line to dry. The weight of the clothes
forced out the pulley to which the rope
was tied, and Mrs. Keating, who was lean
ing upon the rope, lost her balance. Al
most by a miracle she did not fall over
the balustrade, but staggered back and
rolled down about twenty steps.
She was considerably shaken up, and
Dr. de With was hurriedly summoned.
He found that she had escaped with a
sprained wrist and ankle. She is a big,
heavy woman, which helped to save her
from having some bones broken.
If she had fallen forward and over the
balustrade sho would have dropped a dis
tance of about thirty feet with serious re
sults. â  .
CHINESE MUST GO BACK
United States Commissioners
Can Enforce the Exciu-
sioa Act.
Judge Morrow Decides That Judge
Heaccck's Interpretation of the
Law Is Correct
United States District Judge Morrow yes
terday banded down an opinion sustaining
the position taken by United States At
torney Foote and United States Commis
sioner Heacock in the habeas corpus pro
ceedings in the matter of Wong Focfc, a
Chinaman found in Arizona without the
necessary papers entitling him to land/
Commissioner Heacock decided that the
judgment ; of deportation rendered by
United States Commissioner 3." H. Carpen
ter of the Third Judicial, District of the
Territory of Arizona, which order was
approved by United States 'Judge Baker
of that district, was valid and should be
carried out. â  Counsel > for the 'Chinaman
contended that Commissioner Carpenter's
order was illegal and invalid, and that
only a United States Judge has power to
examine witnesses and make orders in
Chinese deuonation cases. In his opin
ion Judge Morrow says: -
It is unnecessary, to consider at length the
question involved. The whole matter was criti
cally discussed and considered by the special
referee (Commissioner Heacock) ln his * opin
ions and findings, filed May 3, 1897. I airree
with him that section 3 of the act is to be
read in connection with section' 6. Section '_
of the same act is also consistent with and
fortifies the interpretation: to be given to the
expression, .."A -United. States Judge." That
Congress intended that United States Com
missioners should have the power to deter
mine whether Chinese persons were lawfully
within the United States and to make the ap
propriate order of deportation if they were
found to be within the United States "in vio
lation'! of section 6 of that act is, I think,
patent from a reading of the act oi May 5,
1892, as amended by the act of November 3*
1893, in its entirety", and also from previous
acts upon the subject.
The" expression "A United States Judge"
found in section 6 of the act of May 5, 1892,
is in my judgment a general one, and refers
to those judicial officers, viz.: "Justice, Judge
or Commissioner," previously and specifically
enumerated in sections 2 and 3 of the same
act. ! A United States Commissioner Is cer
tainly a judicial officer, and exercises, it is
True within very narrow limits, the functions
of a United States Judge. . * * * One of the
strongest reasons tor the appointment of a
United States Commissioner in certain local i-
ties is because distance or tbe difficulty of
travel render the court ana the Judge thereof
difficult of access.
The prisoner was remanded into the
custody of tne Marshal and will be sent
back to China.
In the cases of Tsu Tse Mcc and three
other Chinamen fonnd illegally in Texas,
the Commissioner ordered the prisoners
remanded for deportation.
NO MONEY TO PAY.
City Employes Matt Go to the Broker!
for Two or Three Months
at least.
It is quite possible that the City em
ployes whose salaries are to be . held
out until the new fiscal year in order to
pay the demands of contractors may have
to wait a much longer time than the mid*
die of July.
lt has developed that there will be no
money to pay them for about three
months. The reason of tbis is that the
personal property taxes, out of which it is
intended to pay them, will not be appor
tioned until September, and that there
will be very little money available until
then. ,lIJ__|HBIB-J--I-B-_'l **'-'
The money received from fees and other
sources before September 1 will-not be
nearly sufficient to supply the demands.
The brokers will reap a harvest, for in any
event, whether next month's pay is forth
coming or not, the July and August sala
ries will not be paid out of the City trea
sury. .
