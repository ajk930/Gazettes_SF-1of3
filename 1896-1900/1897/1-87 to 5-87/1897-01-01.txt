Reforms of a similar character, it is
amtained, were prepared for both

PHILADELPHIA. Pa., Dec. 31.â
Cuban insurgents are waging "an active
warfare against -the Spanish army in the
eastern provinces of; the island, according
to reports brought to this city by Captain
Gray of the British steamship .Tiverton,'
which arrived from Santiago de Cuba.'
After leaving Santiago no less than six en

Mountains between the insurgents 7 and
the Spanish soldiers were witnessed from
the deck of the Tiverton. -â ' tr - " "r*;
Captain Gray says that shot and shell
were scattered in all directions in the sea
not far- from the vessel, and that many;
wounded and dying men could' bs seen
rolling down the steep mountains to the
edge of the sea. The insurgents, the cap-;
tain ' says. ? were ] * undoubtedly part of
Gomez's army, who had been sent to the
coast to convoy an insurgent expedition
to the interior of the island. Nearly all
the way from Santiago to Cape Mays! in
surgent camps were visible. ..' . â  . j
While the Tiverton was 'In'Nuevltas the
insurgents were encamped on the out
skirts of the town 'and' could be plainly

breakfast. \- Tbey even went _so â¢ far, Cap
tain Gray declares, as, to send challenges
to the Spanish officers to attack them, but
slipped away when the , soldiers appeared.
When the Tiverton left Santiago the num

of the city was much improved. ,

was found dead in the rear of his resi
dence, 8378 West Pine boulevard, at" 6:30
o'clock t is morning. He had evidently
jumped from the window of- his room on
- the ; third t floor , some time between mid
night and daybreak and dashed his brains
out on the stone flagging of the yard. At
6:30 o'clock this morning one of the
stable-boys employed 'by Mrs. Manion, a
sister-in-law, with whom Mr.' McCullagh
lived, found the body. ' The skull .was
crushed in and the brains were scattered
about on the flagging. Mr. McCullagh
was attired in his nigbiciothes. Mr. Mc-
Cullagh had been confined to his room
since November 10 with acute asthma,
complicated with nervous depression as a

election. v â¢ â  <â¢ . 'Â..-â â¢

for a little while last evening. He said be

His brain was affected, but bis intellect

nervousness and exhaustion, complicated
with a recurring kidney trouble. ' . The

Joseph B.McCnJlagh; was born in Dub
lin, Ireland, in November, 1842. and when
about 11 years of, age came to thii country
on a tciling^hip, working- his passage be
fore the mast. ti .' Arriving in New York in
1853 he 'was. apprenticed to ; learn the
printing business in the office of the Free
j man's Journal. ;_. : ,,,. t'j~ '*â¢, â .'-â . â¢ â  -
Five years later, in 1858, he came to St.
Louis and entered the office of the Chris
tian! Advocate as a printer. When the
war broke out he, acted as correspondent
for the Cincinnati; Commercial and. this
work gained him a great reputation. Later
he acted as Washington correspondent for
that paper. _. . , . .' -Â,-'â :':
In 1868 he became editor of. the Cincin
nati Enquirer, and subsequently, in 1870,
went to Chicago and took charge of the
Republican .of ..that city. The great
fire of the. following year swept the Re
publican out of existence' and Mr. McCul
lagh assumed . editorisi management of
the Missouri Democrat of St. Louis. The
paper was later on consolidated with the
Globe, and Mr. McCullagh . continued In
charge of the Globe-Democrat from that
time to the present. He never married. .
Every minute detail surrounding the
tragic death of Mr. McCullagh r has been
developed and all confirm the theory of
death by suicide. One of the mental tend*
encies of the deceased, known only to a
few. who were bis intimates, was the stoi
cal belief that when life was a burden it
could in good conscience be laid down.
It is now admitted by his attendants
that be committed suicide. At 10 o'clock
last night -be was . found in bed almost
asphyxiated and unlighted gas jets turned
on. He was with difficulty revived. When
nis room was , examined to day the gas
jets were again found turned on. . The
attempt at gas suffocation proved too slow
for the determined man, and in despera
tion be leaped from a window. ' The death
of no citizen of Bt, Louis within a decade
has caused such a. sensation.,' All classes
grieve ! at his tragic end, and none more
than the political opponents who he has2
valiantly fought and often vanquished.
The details of the obsequies will be an
nounced to-morrow.
CHARACTER OF McCULLAGH.
Incidents in the Life of the Great Xetet
paper Man.'
During the siege of Vicksburg McCul
lagh was doing newspaper work and was
in the wheelhouse of a blockade runner
wben a cannon-ball took away half of the
frame structure. McCullagh ' turned to
the terror-stricken pilot after removing a
hitherto undisturbed cigar from his mouth
and asked "Do yon suppose that fellow
intended that shot for us?"
McCullagh admired manly men above
all things and hated a coward. In his
newspaper experience in Cincinnati,
Chicago and St. Lous, and especially in
the latter city, his personal nerve was
frequently put to a test and was never
found wanting. His correspondence for
the paper he represented during the
Civil War was graphic and masterly and
the letters he wrote for the paper have
served to make history.
McCullagh was an indefatigable worker.
He not only managed the Globe-Democrat
as far as its editorial policy was concerned,
but wrote its leading editorials and
editorial paragraphs. He was a master of
epigrams, and his editorial paragraphs
were always terse and full of meat. He
was always at his best in the face of
defeat. He did his most brilliant work
after the defeat of Blame in 1888.
McCullagh's greatest endeavor in life
was to build up a, paper for the masses,
and when he bad lull sway of the Globe-
Democrat be came near to doing this.
His idea in journalism was to make a
paper that would be of interest wherever
it might be taken up by readers. Pursuing
this course, be made the Democrat
a paper that was read by travelers every
where. There was never a piece of news
afloat, that McCullagh did not get. He
had a sublime disregard for telegraphic
tolls, and would often order a bit of cable
intelligence from a European capital,
which would not make more than a dozen
lines, but yet would cost the paper a
princely sum. Still it was the "news,"
and that was what McCullagh was after.
Under bis management, when he had
things his own way on the Globe-Democrat,
its telegraphic tolls were tremendous. He
had a special correspondent in almost
every town arid hamlet in the United
States and in all the principal cities
abroad, and he knew almost every one of
them by name and demanded from each
of them the news.
"What is news" was never a conundrum
to McCullagh. He knew what news was,
and got it
McCullagh was thoroughly democratic in
away. He was passionately fond of bil
liard-playing, and always indulged in a
game or two before dinner at the Southern
Hotel. One could always find him there
at 6 o'clock in a genial, kindly mood,
ready to roll the ivory bails with any one
who cared to play, with him. As he was
an expert in the newspaper business, so
was he an expert at billiards. The time
be spent at the billiard-table was probably
his happiest, except when he gloated over
some great coup that he had made for his
paper.
When playing billiards he was always
'approachable. A young fellow once called
upon McCullagh in his office and asked
por a position on the paper. He was
briefly told that there was no place open
for him. That night he strolled in the
Southern Hotel billiard-room and found
McCullagh rolling the balls around the
table in a listless way that betokened a
desire to have some one challenge him for
a game. The young man took a cue from
the rack, the balls were lined up and they
entered upon the contest. The young
fellow out of a job proved to be the
superior player and defeated McCullagh.
At the end of the _.a_ne the managing
editor turned to the solicitor for a position
on his paper and said:
"Come down to the office to-night. I
have something for you to do."
And w. en the young man w6nt down to
the Globe-Democrat office he was given a
position on the telegraphic desk at a very
good salary.
These are but incidents tbat indicate
something of the character of Joe McCul
lagh. He was one of the old-time news
paper men that loved his paper above
pelf and fame. He bad a keen apprecia
tion of the dignity of the newspaper pro
fession, and a happy faculty of imbuing
this feeling into the minds of all the men
Who worked for him. He was a courage
ous man, a rattling good newspaper man,
a good fellow and it is a pity that he is
dead.

Boston Aldermen A our Want to Spend
the Money for a School.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 31.â The appoint
ment of trustees to administer the Frank
lin fund was considered in the Suffolk
Probate Court yesterday by Judge Grant.
When Benjamin Franklin died in 1798 he
gave by bis will to the inhabitants of Bos
ton Â£1000 sterling to be let out in small
amounts to needy apprentices of the town
at an annual interest of 5 per cent. This
plan was to be pursued for a period of 100
years from the time of his death, when
the fund with its accumulations should be j
applied to specified public objects. The
management of this fund was directed by
his will to be under the Selectmen, "uni
ted with the ministers of the oldest Epis
copal, Congregational and Presbyterian
churches of Boston. :
The fund now amounts to $360,000 and
the Board of Aldermen would like to ap
propriate it for the erection and mainte
nance of a trades school. '
The case before the court to-day was
the petition of Mayor Quincy and the Al
dermen for the appointment of them
selves and Revs. Stopford Brooks, Duane
and MeClellan, as the ministers of the
tbree oldest churches enumerated in tbe
will, as trustees to administer the fund.
Ever since 1822, when , Boston became a
city, there have been no Selectmen, and it
is a question whether or not since th?t
year there has been any trustee for the
fund at all. The case was continued till
Monday. '...'â¢. *'â¢â¢*-*_ ; "- : 'i

CONTRACT FOR
TWO CRUISERS
They Will Be Constructed
in This Country for
Japan.
One of the Modern Warships to
Be Built by the _cotts, the
Other by the Cramps.
Great Speed and Power Must Be Shewn
by th; Vessels to Fill x
Requirements
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 31.â Twen
ty-four months from this date the rapidly
growing Japanese navy will be increased
by the addition of two swift cruisers of
American build.
The contracts were sisned to-day at the
Japanese legation by Minister Hoshi, rep
resenting the Japanese Government, and
by Henry Scott of San Francisco and
Charles H. Cramp of Philadelphia, repre
senting the Union Iron Works and the
Cramps' shipyards respectively. -
Shortly after the the termination of the
Japanese war, when it became
known that Japan purposed building a
large navy, the two American firms sent
aeents to Tokio to secure a part of the
work. Their efforts were for a time un
successful, but they were ably seconded
by the legation at Washington, particu
larly by its naval attaches, and by the fur
ther fact that a ter a careful investigation
of the great European and American
navies the Japanese Government satisfied
itself that the Americans had reached the
perfection of naval machinery and that
our engines and boilers were superior to
those of other nations.
Tnese favoring influences culminated
to-day in the signing of contracts.for two
second-class protected cruisers, one to be
built at --.an Francisco and the other at
Philadelphia, both to be completed with
in two years. '-y "yr" * '_* '*â  *i '._*'
The two vessels -will - cost $3,000,000 in
round numbers and represent the latest
and best type of architecture. Each will
have a displacement of 4760 tons, or 260
tons more than the Chicago, which was
one of the original quartet of steam vessels
that marked the renaissance of tbe
navy. Their length over all will be 374
feet with a bread of 48 feet, an extreme
depth of 30 feet and a draft of 17 feet 9
inches.
In point of speed they will outstrip any
v ssel in the American navy except the
Minneapolis, which Bteam3 a trifle more
than 23 knots an hour. The new vessels
will make 22>*" knots under forced draught,
which is a fraction faster than the Colum
bia, the sister ship to the Minneapolis. '"
They will be -Constructed with longi
tudinal and transverse bulks, divided into
compartments, an armored conning tower
and the engine and boiler rooms .will be
protected underneath by a double bottom.
Their main battery will consist of two j
eight-inch guns, one i:/ the forecastle and
tbe other in the poop, with a secondary
battery of 10-centimeter guns, twelve
12-pounders and six balf-f-onnders. The
12-centimeter guns and the 12-pounders
will have a broadside fire. .Their offensive
Qualities will be completed by the addition
of five torpedo tubes. The vessels will be
built of the best quality of American steel
and represent the newer types of American
construction. The engines will be triple
expansion with cylindrical boilers. In
the arrangement of the crew's quarters
and the galleys, they will differ somewhat
from American- ships and made to
conform to the Japanese idea of utility
and comfort.
Some of the guns will be manufactured
in England and the remainder in the
imperial yards of Japan. A similar con
tract will be given to an English ship
building firm, with a view to testing the
relative merits of American and English
skill. If the two vessels in question prove
satisfactory, they will point the way to
future contracts for American builders.
It was stated this afternoon by. Com
mander Mania of the Japanese legation
.that the vessels composing the American
fleet in Eastern waters during the past
year have proved an instructive object
lesson to the Japanese Government as
showing the capabilities of the Americans
in' the art of ship-buildiug. The Olympia,
tbe superb protected cruiser of nearly 6000
tons displacement and carrying a battery
of four 8-inch and ten 5-inch rapid-fire
guns, was sent to the China station a year
ago, where her fine sea-going qualities
won for herself . arid incidentally for her
builders unstinted praise, and aided mate
rially in satisfying tbe Japanese that the
Americans are building to-day -the best
ships in the world. It is an interesting
circumstance that the contracts made to
day are the first Japan has given to any
outside nation since the late war. Prior
to that contracts were placed in England
for several small cruisers, but none has
since been made there, although, ps pre
viously stated, a sister ship to the two
American vessels will now be built in that
country. â  ' â¢**â¢'

ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 31.â Edward C.
Flanagan, an employe of the Standard Oil
Company, attempted to exterminate the
Allen family at Poplar Springs, De Kalb
County, to-night, and did kill three. His
victims were Dixon E. Allen and wife, an
old couple, both aged over 70 years, and
Miss Ruth Stack. â¢ ' .
Flanagan seems to have been in love
with : Leila . Allen, the 11 - year - old
daughter of Dixon Alien, the old couple's
married son. Allen and his wile and two
children lived with them in a cottage four
miles from the city limits. ' Flanagan had
been boarding with them for six months.
His actions to-day were not quite natural,"
but he did not cause ary alarm. It was
noticed, though, that he was anxious to
get the members of the family to leave
the house. Late in the afternoon be re
turned and when supper was announced
be ate with the family.
When he bad finished, be asked Mrs. G.
W. , Allen to give him a drink of water.
She left the room to gut it. Her husband
was standing )by the table talking to his
father. Flanagan went to bis own. room
and returning in a moment thrust a pistol
close to the son's head and j fired. Allen
dodged | and \ the j ball struck ! him . in the
back of the head. .- .'â  ;- : A :^y. '!__/''"-
Flanagan stepped over his body and
knocked the lamp from the .table with a
wave of his pistol. Old Mrs. Allen, Miss
Stack and the children ran into the room
in terror. Flanagan clubbed! the elder
Allen with his pistol and killed him. -!
Then he strode quickly from . the room,
where the women ?, were screaming, and
began firing on them. Old Mrs. Allen
was shot through the body twice arid
killed. Miss Stack was shot through the
back of tbe neck and fatally wounded. .(. .<
_ At this moment the daughter-in-law,
who had gone for the water, returned and
rushed into the room. -.'She found that
Flanagan 'â  was trying to kill * Leila, her
daughter. She struck the pistol, and then
clinched with the murderer. _
He struggled until he had dragged her
outdoors. Flanagan fought like a mad
man and tried his best to shoot her. She
succeeded in preventing him from firing
for a minute or more, "uy this time her
husband had recovered consciousness and
he ran out to his wife's rescue. Help soon
arrived. Flanagan was bound and held
until Sheriff Austin arrived. v '
A large crowd assembled' and talked
freely of lynching Flanagan. The Sheriff
did not wait to give them an opportunity,
but immediately hurried the prisoner off
and brought him into the city, where he
was placed in the jail.
Miss Stack died about midnight. Bhe
was from Birminhham and was to have
been married. _

GRAND FORKS, N. D.'. Dec. 3Lâ a
meeting of the : Second National Bank
this morning they decided not to open for
business. The following notice was posted
on the doors: ' â  *-
, "On account of recent heavy with
drawals of deposits and the impossibility
of realizing on our asset;*, it has been de
cided by our board of directors to suspend
and the Comptroller has been advised of
our action." - "!; : _ 7
.The officers of the bank were inter
viewed arid while not prepared to make
any statement until the Comptroller and
Bank Examiner could be heard from, the
following facts were gleaned from the
statement made by one of the bank
officers: ; Immediately following the
failure of the Bank of Illinois and the
Bank of Minnesota, the bank had sus
tained a shrinkage of $40,000, while their
depoists amounted to about $17,000 during
the last fourteen days.
V On last Monday the bank published a
statement of this business at the . close of
business December 17. which showed loans
arid " discounts, $158,086 92; due from na
tional and State banks and approved re
serve' agents, $9342 59; due to "banks and

bank was to be of $20,000 capital and to
commence business on or about January

president of the failed Bank of Illinois,
and Philip Henrici, the most prominent
German restaurant-owner in the city, who
are tbe bondsmen of the bankrupt banker,
E. S. Dreyer, as treasurer of the West
Park board, will be formally notified next
week that Mr. Dreyer has failed to acquit
a claim of $310,000 in favor of the park
board.
The bondsmen will be called upon to
make the amount good, as they are sure
ties for $500,000. This aotion bas been
decided upon by the board and its attor
ney has been instructed to proceed.
Mr. Dreyer is seriously ill at his home
with inflammation of the kidneys, and his
physician has forbidden any one seeing
him to talk over his business difficulties.
Because of the banker's physical con
dition, Bondsmen Washburne and Hen
rici did not press their inquiries when
they visited him a few days ago to learn
how he had invested the park money. He
admitted, however, that he had sold park
bonds at one time to exceed $50,000, which
was a violation of a promise made at the
time Mr. Henrici signed the bond, accord
ing to" the latler's statement to-day. He
added: "Mr. Dreyer told .me he was
worth a million dollars above his liabili
ties at the bank. I believed it then, but I
know better now. I was deceived." -
Mr. Washbume says he will not shrink
from his obligation. He is also a private
banker.
At a special meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Dime Savings Bank which
was elected 'yesterday Ralph Metcalf was
appointed treasurer of the bank, a posi- .
tion equivalent to that of manager. This
action displaced George W. Reed from
the treasurershtp, which he held for years.
Mr. Metcalf, to whom the appointment
was a surprise, assumed charge of the
bank at noon. He said be had received
no orders as to _ the bank's future and
would only say the directors had arranged
to meet every dollar of deposits when due,
or before. Interest ..may be paid January
2. The directors are not disposed to ac
cept any offer tof outside assistance to

DEBS IS A SO CI ALLS T.
Did Xot Support Bryan Because He lit -
' Here in Free Silver.
TERRE HAUTE, Tnd.; Dec. 31.â Eugene
V. Debs has left the.; People's party and
become an out and out socialist. In a let
ter to be printed to-morrow in the Rail
way Times he states' that he - supported
Bryan and free silver not because he re
garded the free coinage of silver as a
panacea for National ills, but because "it
furnished ;> a rallying cry ? and _ common
ground against the trusts, syndicates and
corporations, and once united they could
press forward against industrial slavery.
He r says 80 per cent of organized wage
earners voted for Bryan, and the result of
the election was due to the fact that un
organized workers overwhelmingly out
numbered those who were organized: and
wbo bad been educated and drilled in the
tactics of the enemy and could not be
coerced from 7 voting : their own , convic
tions. - The ballot, however much it has
been eulogized, has been beaten to the
earth â by boodle, and cannot be relied
upon to execute the will of the people
while they are in industrial bondage. He
believes tnere is a way out: of -this "laby
rinth, tortuous, blinding and confusing
maze." The leaders of the socialist army
have thrown open the door of bone to the
toiling masses. Speaking for himself he
says he is a socialist because he has be
come convinced that the competitive sys
tem is utterly cannibalistic." The issue is
socialism versus capitalism. He con
fesses to no hope for the toiling masses
except by the pathway mapped out by the
socialists. , The election was really a
flaming symbol of victory because it
aroused the mind forces of millions of
men.

What Came of an ration by
Two Brilliant Y.ung
Doctors.
Death, Remorse, Suicd*. Insanity
/ and Life 'Imprisonment, Figure
in the Narratiy--
\ LONDON, Eng.. Dec With the ac
tion 10-day of the National Medical Coun
cil in striking from the roll of regi tered
practitioners the names of Drs. Timothy
Jones and Henry Richards "Finis" was
written to a story of one of the saddest
tragedies in the later history o: the med
ical profession of Great Britain.
Briefly told, Dr. Jones has Deen for years
one of the leading physicians and sur
geons of Wales,' He was a member of
several . learned societies, ami medical
libraries have been enriched by numerous
.works of research and . importance bear
ing his seal of authorship. A
His practice was aristocratic and lucra
tive and he lived in magnificent style at
Swansea. Dr. Richards, bis principal as
sistant, was a young graduate w great
promise. A few months since Dr. Jones
was approached by the head of a w,_]thy
family of which be was medical ad
viser, and who â¢â ' implored him to
perform an illegal operation up.n
a b autiful young girl named Ll^-
Challenger, forewoman of a millinery em
porium, and with whom the doctor's
patron had been on intimate terms. In
an evil hour Dr. Jones, .notwithstanding
his hi.h reputation, consented. Then
followed an appalling series of tragedies.
The young woman died under tbe sur
geon's knife and in his own office.
Concealment was impossible. The po
lice were notified, and the doctor and his
assistant, young Richards, were arrested
as the body was being borne from the
Morgue. The Coroner's jury ordered
them held for trial on a charge of willful
murder. They refused to betray the prin
cipal in the case; but the latter, overcome
by remorse and apprehension, committed
suicide on the night they were lodged in
jail. His wife, a society queen and weal
thy in her. own right, became a raving
maniac, and is now an inmate of an asy
lum near Bristol. ...*..
Drs. Jones and Richards were placed on
trial for their lives, tbe prosecution being
assumed by the Crown. Almost hercu
lean efforts were made to send both men
to the gallows, but the previous high
standing of Dr. Jones had created strong
sympathy in his behalf. The trial lasted
a week, and in the end the two prison
ers were convicted of manslaughter. . The
presiding Judge was less disposed toward
leniency, and a month ago to-day sentence
was pronounced. *' * â ""- '"-~*"-~-
Dr. Jones, author," lecturer, humanita
rian, leader of , bis profession and society
lead-*-, was sent to penal servitude for life.
Young Richards, his j nupil, found a bril
liant career cut short with a sentence of
five years. To-day the final words of the
last chapter were written and the names
of the two unfortunates blotted from the
records of the profession.* /_/ . â¢ *

ROME, Italy, Dec. 31.â Inquiry at the
Vatican concerning the report that Arch
bishop Corrigan of New York was soon to
be elevated to the cardinalate has elicited
the information that none of the Pope's
entourage expects the appointment, will
be made. The Jesuit element In the
sacred college is favorable to the Arch
bishop's promotion, it is said, but Cardi
nal Kampolla, tbe Papal Secretary of
State, is opposed to it, not for personal
reasons, but sorely because of the signifi
cance which the. opposing party in the
College of Cardinals would attach to the
appointment. Furthermore, it is said at
the Vatican that the nomination of any
new Cardinal at the present time is ex
tremely unlikely. _

ASK PROTECTION
Higher Duties Required for
the Manufacturers of
Wood.
Millions invested in an Industry
Ihat Is at' Present on
the Wane.
Members of the Ways and Means
Committee Told About Comp.
tion With Canada.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 31.-The
two industries, woods and manufactures
of wood and pulp, papers and books, were
the subjects of the hearing to-day by the
Committee on Ways and Means. The
hearing was opened on behalf of the
lumber interests by C. D. Goodyear of
Buffalo, who had been designated for the
purpose by the Cincinnati lumber conven
tion, and who was accompanied by two
oi her representatives of that industry.
Mr. Goodyear said that recent events
convinced the lumber people that tbe pro
tective idea would prevail at least until
the assembling of a new Congress. As
suming that protection to American labor
and industries would be the policy of the
incoming administration, the lumber
people were present to demand what was
due them. here was invested in this in
dustry over $750,0-0,000,. It was one of the
most important industries deserving con
sideration at the bands of the committee.
There were at least 600,000 persons directly
engaged in it and altogether there were
3.000,000 people receiving their livelihood
from ihis great industry.
He .aid that the lumbermen were not
asking anything exorbitant nor beyond
what was reasonab'e. What they asked
was, substantially, that white pine, hem
lock, Dasswocd and sycamore be placed
on the same footing as spruce, which was
now protected by a duty of $2 per thou
sand, while the others had bad only a pro
tection of $1. Under all tariff legislation,
he said, spruce had remained under the $2
clause. Under this protection the prod
ucts of Maine, represented by those in
Congress who looked after her welfare,
had never failed to have protection to the
extent of $2 a thousand, while white pine,
hemlock, sycamore and all other woods
were protected only to the extent of $1.
The chairman (Dingley of Maine) re
marked that Maine was a pine-tree State.
"Yes," Mr. Goodyear replied, "a pine
tree State without any pine, but with a Jot
of spruce, of which a new crop can be
raised every thirty years. '
Dolliver (R.) of lowa asked whose fault
it was that other lumber had not received
the same protection as spruce. â¢
"It was the fault ol the lumbermen
themselves," said Mr. Goodyear- "Unul
1*92 they never teemed to have awakened
from their lethargy. They name here t..'
that time,' but the sentiment at that time '
was directed against the protective idea,
and they failed io accomplish what they j
asked for. Now, the lumbermen of this i
country are crushed, and the/ have learned !
of the important features of the tariff act I
better tban they did before. They have j
fouhd out thai under free trad", as it is I
under the Wilson act, the industry bas |
gone into decay, and to-day they are suf- I
fering from foreign competition to an ex
tent that they never suffered before. The
failures among lumbermen have been
larger tban in any other large and leading
industry. It amounts to almost paralysis
in some sections of the country. In the
State of Michigan and in the Northwest
generally the payrolls of lumber have
fallen off more than 40 per cent since the
free-trade tariff bill has been in opera
tion." ,'v3KB
The Chairman Do you ask that a duty
of $1 be placed on all kinds of lumber?
Goodyear â Not at all; but we ask that
the duty of $2 be applied to all kinds of
lumber.
Canada was the greatest competitor in
woods. The conditions prevailing there
were much more liberal. Here the Gov
ernment demand $3 ncr thousand units
stumpage against 50 cents in Canada.
Libor in Canada was less, and here the
lumbermen paid over $3,000,000 annually
on their lauds, while the Canadians pay
no taxes at all. In his opinion the present
rate on railroad t. â¢_>, . telegraph and tele
phone poles and fence rails and poles
should be continued.
In reply to Russell of Connecticut, he
said that he would not tax logs. All of
the log- entering' here came from Canada;
their handling and milling gave employ
ment to a vast number of laborers, and
the cost of bringing the logs to the United
States and tne risk involved amounted to
a protection himself.. Many mills and a
lar.e amount of labor depended on this
supply, and the lumbermen did not want
to damage this branch ot the industry.
Canada was also sending all of -her cheap
lumber here, to the detriment of our insti
tutions.
The chairman remarked on the question
of revenue fr<-*m lumber that between 1890
and 1895 the importation of lumber had
increased, while the revenue had fallen
over $2,000,000 to $712,000.
"We surrendered," he added, "$1,300,000
in revenue and gave the Canadians the
privilege of importing $13,000,000 worth of
lumber here without any advantage to
this Government."
"I thank the chairman very, much,"
Mr. Goody, replied, "for the statement
he has made. i deem that statement only
necessary to sustain my argument, which
is that the Government has not only
under the present tariff lost a. large
amount of revenue, but thut the law has
also incited competition against us in one.
of the greatest industries of the country."
The act of 1890, he said, gave lumber an
average protection of Â£0 per cent, and that
of 1894 an average of 35. per cent. The
lumbermen were now asking $2 per 1000,
an averago of about 20 per cent ' and a
1' wer average than had been given in any
tariff bill in the past thirty years. They
asked this and thought tnat the business
warranted it.
Tawney of Minnesota inquired whether
it was true that there existed a combina
tion or trust among the lumbermen.
Goodyearâ There is no, such a thing in
existence .in the United States, acd it is
not possible.
I. Enochs of Jackson, Miss., appeared
on behalf of Southern lumber ant. asked
why it should be discriminated agi. inst in
favor of cotton, tobacco and "mountain
dew." r \^X . .., v^-'
Thomas Walker of Minneapolis _ asked:,
for a duty sufficient to protect the capital
invested in the labor employed. , ;
The witness was inquired of by Tawney
of Minnesota, Mr. Payne of New York and
other members as to the relative prices of
lumber before and since the tariff act of
1890 under which the duty on lumber was
reduced. He admitted that even under
that tariff reduction the prices had gone
up until 1893, but bad since fallen in the
Minneapolis market from $12 50 a thou
sand to $9.
He did not assert positively whether the
falling off i*" price was to be attributed to
the influx of Canadian lumber under the
reduced rate of duty, or to the general
depression of business; but suggested that
both causes had operated. He denied any
Knowledge of a lumber combination.
A.H. Winchester of Buchanan, W. Va.,
spoke for the lumbermen of that State and
its purely American laborers. _-- .
C. H. Lang, representing, the rattan
manufacturers of the Wakefield Rattan
Company of Massachusetts, asked for a
duty ol 5 cents per pound on all manufac
tures of rattan not lurther advanced than
spilt into reeds and strands and a duty of
10 cents per pound on chair cane and other
products of rattan split and sawed ready
for manufacture. He also asked that the
clause providing for tbe Iree entry of reeds
not further manufactured than cut into
lengths suitable for whips be eliminated
and that a duty be placed on them.
L. C. Wagner of New York protested
against the inequality in the present
specific rates of duty on cigar labels which
were not consistent with the specific rates
on other lithographic prints. He would
later submit rates that he would suggest.
John Norris of New York said that the
newspapers of the United States were now
at the mercy of a combine of paper-mills
to keep the price of paper up. The aim
was to keep the price at abont 2)_ cents
per pound, when it could be made and sold
at 1% cents per pound. To take the pres
ent duty off paper would be a check upon
monopoly and force the combine to .keep
the price down.
TESTS OF STtitoL ARMOR.
Plates From Carnegie to Be More Rigidly
Inspected.
WASHINGTON. .D. C, Dec. 31.â The
special board appointed by Secretary Her
bert to examine a number of defective
structural steel plates delivered by the
Carnegie Steel Company at Newport News t
for the battle-ships Kentucky and Kear
sarge has submitted its report to the Navy
Department. The board made very ex
tensive tests of material at the shipyards
and arrived at these conclusions: i
That if the specifications be held to re
quire the test of the plates to be made by :
bending the specimens longitudinally a
large proportion of the steel complies
with the specifications. If, however, a
transverse bending test is also required,
only one lot of plates â the 17^-inch plate
âmeets with ,the demands. The defects
are attributed to the fact that the plates
receive most of the work in the mills in
the direction of their length and the
failure of the inspectors to detect these
defects was due to the failure of the
.specifications, in their opinion, to require
a transverse bending test.
The board believes that more reliable
steel for hull plates would be obtained by
chancing the present requirements so as
to allow the tensile strength to very be
tween 57,000 and 66,000 pounds per square
inch, requiring a minimum elongation of
25 per cent of steel above 60,000 pounds
and one-third of 1 per cent additional
elongation for each thousand pounds be
low 60,000. The plates for the battle-ship
Illinois were found to be of- better quality
than those rolled for the Kentucky and
.Kearsarge. In all cases, however, the
s*"-el was found to be of- superior quality
to the best commercial steel, as well as to
that used in foreign navies.
Upon these findings the department bas
authorized the inspector at Newport News
to use so much of the steel plate on hand
as he may rind suitable, while the in
spectors at the mills have been instructed
to hereafter make the transverse bending
test in the plates. The steel board has
been ordered to meet at the department
Saturday next to confer with the Secretary
r-tpecting the changes necessary to .be
made in the specifications.

augh, a prominent minister of Winters,
has just departed from that town under
peculiar circumstances. Waugh, in addi

edited a weekly paper and did politics.

in his church and charges were filed
against him for heresy. His latest esca
pade was of a very sensational character.
Waugh married the favorite daughter of
a prominent Solano County farmer in op
position to her parents' wishes. They re
sided in Winters, apparently happy, until
Waugh began hi* misdeeds by forming an
attachment for a young lady of his con
gregation; took her out driving and en
tertained her at bis study under the pre
tense of teaching Latin. Matters went
from bad to worse until the young lady's
mother intercepted a letter from the min
ister to her daughter. It was shown to
Waugh's wife, who: immediately went to
her parents' home. â  He has since left and
Winters people are of the opinion that he

PACIFIC : GROVE, Cal., Dec 31.â The
highest, tide known -for years prevailed
here last night, and considerable damage
was done to , property along the water
front from the wash of the waves. The
rocky buttress, which supports the tracks
of the Southern Pacific Railroad between
"Chinatown" and Pacific Grove, was
washed away, so that many of the big
stones were loosened and some displaced,
and the" breakers were dashed up over the
track itself.
The new wharf at the bathing beach,
which was built last summer for tbe use
of pleasure boats, was broken up and the
greater part of it was carried out by the
ceding waves.
One casualty so far is reported. A young
lady,* an Eastern tourist sojourning here,
whose name .is unknown, in order to see
the height of the: waves, ventured too far
out on "jLover's "Point," a point twenty
feet high, and: was, thrown by an extra
large breaker* upon the j rocks in such a
way that her leg was wedged between two
bowlders and broken just below the knee.
When found by, her friends she was still
conscious,, but suffering frightfully. , Her
injuries have been attended to and she is
now doing well.
The waves last night dashed over Seal
Rock on the famous Seventeen-mile drive,
something very unusual. In Monterey it
was feared the Del Monte __. bath-house
wharf was in danger, tbc waves breaking
over it and running high up on the beach
under the baths.

returned two I indictments against him
one on a charge of forgery in having, it is
claimed, forged the name of T. A. Acock

As published before in the columns of
this paper, L. M. Landsborougb, who is
Assemblyman- sleet on the Populist ticket

County Clerk for upward of four years,
was discovered to . have formulated a
systematic plan of robbing . the county by
having jurymen' sign their demands for
fees due on blank forms and then raising
the amount due them and pocketing the
balance. As far as known he has been
pursuing this method but a short, time,
and claims to have stolen but â¢ $140, which
he has made good. The affair has created
much comment, as the guilty man was

other and: possessed an army of friends,

TIRED OF ORATORY
AND PETITIONS
The Harbor Commission
Get Down to Practi
cal Work.
Will Make Their Own Investi
gations and Collect Their
Own Evidence.
An Exhaustive Study to Ba Made of
Both Santa Monica and San
Pedro Waters.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 31.â The
Harbor Commission having now set
seriously to. work to make their selection
between San Pedro and Santa Monica,
they will hear no more oratory, listen to
no more petitions and not be further
bothered by the bickering of rival engi
neers, but will henceforth make their own
investigations and collect their own evi
dence. The board held an all-day execu
tive session to-day, but did nothing more
tban take measures, and have soundings
and borings made all over the waters of
the contesting places.
It is regarded as probable that little at
tention will be paid to the arguments made
during the public sessions or to the evi
dence then taken. It looks as if the board
tended to make a very exhaustive study
on its own account, as it has been given
out that tbe members expect to remain
hereabouts a month or six weeks.
The work of boring commenced to-day
at San Pedro and the steamer Gedney wiil
be used to make sounding at both places.
To-morrow* the commission will take a
day' off from its labors and go to Pasadena
to see the Rose Carnival as guests ot the
Chamber of Commerce of that city.
Kramer Convicted of Forgery.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 31.â W. E.

a check for $22 65 on the Farmers' and
Mercbants'*Bank and caused J. W. French
to cash the check. Kramer and a com
panion, J. Harris, left tbe city, but
were arrested at Fresno by Detective
Aublc Kramer claimed to have secured
the check from a man named H. Kearney,
with whom he had traveled from Truckee
to Los Angeles.

AA' I A YAEZ SHOO TIX G.
Result of an Attempt to Jump a Mining
Claim,
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec 3Lâ A
telephone message received here to-day
from Santa Yiuz brings the report that
Frank Knight was shot by William Step,
a rancher, 84 years old. Step claims that
Knight jumped, or tried to jump, his
claim. A man named Fillmore, with
whom Knight was living, it is said, is also
mixed up in the fray.
Bad blood has existed between them for
some time, since the trio were in trouble
over the stealing of some hogs from an
other rancher named Wiat, over a year
ago. Considerable amusement was created
in the court at the time over the expert
testimony of the black and white hairs of
the dead porkers. Knight's wounds are
not believed to be fatal and so far no ar
rests have been made.
The Monterey at Santa Barbara.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec. 31.â The
coast defense vessel Monterey arrived
here at 3:30 p. m. to-day. She came glid
ing slowly but gracefully down the chan
nel and anchored about a mile from shore.
Some of the boys were allowed to come
ashore and are now enjoying Santa Bar
bara's delightful climate.
BUNKOED TO HIS DEATH.
Fleeced by Sharpers, a Texas County
Treasurer Covers His Shortage
i With a Bullet.
AUSTIN. Texas, Dec 3L â County
Treasurer A. J. Jernigan shot himself and
inflicted a wound from which he will
undoubtedly die. The shooting was a
deliberate attempt at suicide and took
place in bis office.
Some time ago the colored porter of the
County Courthouse came to him with a
story of buried Mexican gold. Some
colored friends of the porter had let him
into the secret. They claimed to know
tiie exact spot where the gold was buried
â¢and said that it was in the vicinity of the
city.
They asserted the gold was of almost
fabulous value and told a plausible story
of their inability to make use of it them
selves, 'I hey offered to sell their secret to
the janitor ior $20. 000.
This amount was wholly beyond his
ability to raise and for a while negotia
tions ceased. Â Finally, however, he
brought up the subject, and then was told
to find out how muc i; he could raise. ' It
was at that time he broached the matter
to Jernigan and got him interested.
Jernigan had no money of his own, but
he was so firmly convinced of the exist
ence of the Mexican treasure that he took
$4500 out of the county lunds and gave it
to the janitor, expecting to be able to re
turn it within a few days. From other
sources the janitor secured $6000, and the
whole amount was paid to the sharpers
who had originated the story, and who
promptly disappeared.
Jernigan was badly broken up by the
affair. He was worried about it as the
end of the year approached, knowing that
the shortage must soon, become known.
Finally when discovery was close at hand
he shot himself.
Suicide of an Ex-Senator.
LINCOLN, Nebr-. Dec. 31.â Ex-State
Senator Henry C. Zebrung, at the head of
the Standard Glass and Paint Company
and one of the most prominent and popu
lar men in Lincoln, committed suicide by
hanging himself in the loft of bis barn
some time during the night, where he
was found by his son early this morning.
He was 52 years old, high in the ranks of
Masonry and .was reputed to be wealthy,
of serene temperament and apparently
without business cares.
Death of General Classen.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Dec. 31.â General

the funds. He was found guilty and sen
tenced to six years in State prison. In

Continued from First Page,
lector against the vessel being allowed to
depart. The protest was filed by the Col
lector, but the vessel was allowed to de
part, as clearance had been granted. The
Commodore carried a ciew of 28 men,
000 cartridges. 175 rifles. 1000 pounds of
giant powder and other munitions of war,
besides a quantity of medicines and stores.
The Dauntless has not yet returned to
load with the cargo of munitions of war,
although permission has been granted her
to clear for Nuevitas, Cuba, with arms
and ammunition. Nothing has been heard
of her since she left here Tuesday after
noon to go wrecking, as her owners say.
.The sudden departure of the cruiser
Raleigh from Key West at 1 o'clock this
morning has caused considerable uneasi
ness in Cuban circles, for it is believed. she
has been ordered to stop the Dauntless
and Commodore and search them to as
certain if they are violating the law by
carrying a body of men as well as a cargo
of arms. If the men are found on either
steamer the vessel will be seized and
brought back to tbis port.
The Three Friends returned to port
to-day and is in charge of the Collector of
Customs. Her crew came ashore Imme
diately and disappeared. None of tbem
would talk.
BELIEVE MACEO IS DEAD.
Member* of the Cuban Junta Do Sot
Credit the Story That He Lives.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 31.â A repre
sentative of Dr. Palma was seen at the
Cuban Junta headquarters in this city this
morning and asked about the dispatches
presented yesterday that Maceo is still
alive in a Cuban hospital, where he is re
covering from his wounds. His attention
was called to a rumor alleged to bave
come from the wife of a prominent Cuban
who landed at Key West confirming tbe
statement that Maceo is alive.
Dr. Palma's representative said: "You
can say that the Cuban Junta believes'that
Maceo is dead and that he died in the
manner described in the circular recently
issued by the Junta. -We have fully satis-'
fied ourselves of his death and are work
ing under that conclusion. While we are
so rry to have lost so great a leader it has
not materially interfered with our plans.
We place no credit in .these repeated
reports that Maceo is alive.'' .
DE LOME VISITIXG OLAEY.
It Is Believed That He Protested Against
the Cruise â¢ f the Dauntless.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 3Lâ Dupuy
de Lome called at the State Department
at noon to-day and had a short inter
view with Secretary Olney. . He declined
on leaving to state the object of his call,
mere remarking that it was -diplomatic
day, when it was customary for members
of the corps to see the Secretary.
There is no improbability in the assump
tion that bis visit was made personally for
the purpose of protesting to Secretary
Olney against any permission 'being
granted by this Government allowing the
Dauntless to carry a cargo of arms to any
Cuban port. The refusal is desired to
avoid any international ; complications
which must inevitably ensue if the per
mission is granted.
With Arms for Insurgents.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 31.â At the
Cuban Junta it was said to-day that the
Dauntless and Commodore would prob
ably leave Jacksonville about Saturday
with arms anc ammunition for the insur
gents. The statement "telegraphed from
aWashington that both will take out clear
ness in the regular way is confirmed
here
Rievera Reported . Wounded.
KEY WEST, Fla., Dec. 3Lâ lt is re
ported here that General . Ruiz Rievera,
who succeeded Maceo, was badly wounded
in an engagement.: The rumor lacks con

In its report tne jury states that it is con
vinced that attempts at blackmailing
have been mede, but it has been unable to
j find sufficient evidence to bring an indict
i ment. The jury hopes that all the officers
j will be untiring in their efforts to bring to

This brief statement of the jury shows
that it believed that T. Demarais, Sam
Ralston and John Harrison were in a con

Lehmann, the victim of the intended mur

Schweizer announces that he will imme

many who would like to see the whole
case aired in the open courts, as it has
many peculiar features.
In its report the Grand Jury calls atten

HEAVY DAMAGES AWARDED.
Rev. Mr. Craven Must Pay Dearly for
Threatening Sirs..- liraui
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 31.â Mrs. Emma
Braun was allowed $45,000 damages by a
jury in Judge Lain's court yesterday in a

CHICAGO, 111-, Dec. 31.â The last day's
session of the Board of Trade was not as
lively as "generally, but when the gong
rang at 12 o'clock 100 or more of the frisk
ier members, armed with sacks of corn,
oats, etc., lined up along the windows and
began a fusillade of cereals upon their fel
lows, '.while-gleeful yells saluted their ef
forts by the '"gallery gods." 'â > There was a
dense crowd in the galleries laughing,
cheering and' begging the throwers to
throw. A bag of chaff 'landed among
them, and great was* the consternation as
the clinging stuff . settled .over sealskin
sacque and broadcloth coat Down stairs
the sharpshooting was becoming dis-
tinctly personal and individual. : .- ; â -
At first v the shooting had been at the
crowd of struggling brokers. As, the
crowd separated into little groups there
was a chance for target practice and it
was well improved.' "ln three minutes it
was all overâ the ammunition had given
out. . ... , '* ".'.. ,
"Quietest closing season on record,''
said one of the old members, v "In fact, it
was an awful fizzle, compared with former
years. Time was that everybody would
have a bag of flour planted somewhere
and ready, but there was not a bit of flour
thrown to-day and not half as much grain
as usual."
It was reported afterward that ansedict
had been issued against the throwing
practice, which accounted for, the small
amount of target shootingjand the innocu
ous character of the missiles.

EUREKA, Cal., Dec. 31.â The extraor
dinarily high tides of' the past few days,
combined with a heavy southeaster pre
vailing, have wrought considerable damage
about Humboldt Bay. There has been an
exceedingly rough bar, and seas have been
breaking in at the entrance and clear
across the bay to the inner shore opposite.
As a result a large section of the Eel River
and Eureka Railroad track, which skirts
the bay there, has been washed out and
seas are breaking across into the reclaimed
fields of Pine and Buhne's dairy farms.
The Eureka and Klamath River Rail
road bas also lost a large section of tract
on the peninsula, near Mad River Slough
in the northern end of the bay caused by
high water. The jetty trestle-work on
both sides of the bar has also suffered.
Several bents of the north trestle were
carried away and a number of scattering
piles were knocked out by wreckage from
the south jetty and swept across the
channel. The current is also cutting away
the inner side of the south sandspit back
of the jetty wharves and landing stages in
the bay. The carrying away of the trestle
does not affect tbe jetty already built, but
work cannot be resumed until the trestle
is rebuilt.

PLOYD'S WONDEEPUL PIEE.
A Taste Which , When , Ouce â¢ Ignited
Nothing Can Pot Out.
There is a fire that never dies, and it is
here, and in this world, too. This strange
fire is of the consistency of paste, and is
harmless when in a quiet state. The fric
tion caused by rubbing it against,- a hard
surface will, however, set it aglow, and
nothing will extinguish the flames, which
will burn' with a blue light and an intense
i.eat until the compound is completely de
stroyed by combustion. Water has no
effect upon it ; it can be made into balls
and thrown anywhere, and it will burn
with a slow but fierce combustion which
makes it unlike any known fire.
Dynamite and gunpowder require a
: spark to Ignite them, and powuer pro
duces an explosion, not a regular fire. To
ignite this compound there is just the
slightest friction of rubbing it against
some ordinary substance. There is no ex
plosion or rapid spreading of flames, but
a strange, pasty substance composed of
living fire, which cannot be stamped out
or killed in any known way.
Jobn Floyd, the discoverer, has been
for several: years delving in all sorts of
cnemicals, as bis numerous inventions re
quired constant study. One day . c wished
id make a certain substance with which to
experiment, and for that purpose placed
in a liquid some waste substances which
he thought would, when dissolved, pro
duce the wished-lor compound. But he
found lbe material he wanted before the
liquid was dissolved, so he left the jar
containing the solution on the shelf for
several weeks, t : inking no more about it.
Finally he thought of using the jar and,
lifting it down from the shelf, some of the
liquid spilt on , the floor. Mr. Foyd
thought nothing about the matter tii he
noticed a sensation of heat about his foot,
and on looking down found that the soit
paste which had fallen out of the bottle
had become a mass of soft, flickering
flames emitting an intense heat. He put
his fool on the spot, stamping it out, as he
thought, and turned to his work.
When he turned around again he saw
that instead of going out the fire paste
was steadily burning; that hi- rubbing it
haa only smeared it over the floor, and it
was eating into the wood every moment.
He then threw several buckets of water on
the stuff, but the water had no effect other
than to be concerted into puffs of steam,
and the fire burned steadily on, cutting its
way through the soft pine flooring. As the
experiments were being conducted in the
back of a drugstore, which was filled with,
dangerous chemicals, he knew that some
thing must be done to put a step to its rav
ages or the whole place would le blown to
atoms. ' ';\
After many fruitless /attempts to put it
out he cured a hatchet, and it was only
by cutting out , the entire square of wood
on: which the : paste , rested tnat he suc
ceeded in stopping the tire, which burned
for at least an dour. ;,:<j_S3Â£g____|g
Afraid of the uses to which this dis
covery might be put, Mr. Floyd has never
made the secret of the ingredients public;
but he says that the cost of making it is
so small that it can easily be used instead
of the cheapest waste materials. And for
that reason he will not let the formula
become known, v for incendiaries y would
take advantage of it and no place would
be sale trom burning. .Those who use oil
or _~ dynamite Or i powder -* can be easily
traced, as some preparation' is necessary,
but with this liquid fire a criminal who
knew its composition could burn his way
noiselessly through '_ any door or set any
home ; on - fire by throwing against it a
noiseless ball of tbe composition.
The cost of making this liquid fire is so
small that it can be easily used instead of
coai in heating a furnace. But the most
valuable properties are those which it pos
sesses ~ which are absolutely foreign -to
those of fire as known to us. \* All forms of
except that of electricity, must be
generated in some kind of a furnace and
be constantly supplied with fuel, but this
fire is both flame and fuel itself. About a
cupful: can be set on fire and it will burn
with a steady glow for an; hour.
This wonder. ul fire can be utilized in
the kitchen* and â "; stoves can be dispensed
with altogether as entirely useless. In
order to fry anything it is only necessary
to bang the pan from a wire and smear
over the bottom with a spoonful of the
liquid. In an instant ; there will be a hot
fire which will burn for over an hour. 80
that the cook of l the '' future .can take her
fire out into the country ; it can be u.ed in
(cooking in camping; there will De no coal
bills, but the work of heating furnaces, of
burning fires in grates or running motors
can be done by a harmless little spoonful
of paste, which can be taken around in the
vest pocket. . .',.,.. ,' * .

Dr. Price's Clever , L
Dog.
Dr. Price's dog gratified â¢ the - monthly
meetine of the Humane Society at Relief
Hall, 141 East Ninth street, yesterday
afternoon. The animal was really some
body else's dog. It was a St/ Bernard dog
of corru.ated, anxious brow and pessimis
tic attitude. Dr. Price called him Trixie.
The dog's 5 owner had failed to secure a
license, so Trixie was impounded, lie
escaped, from the pound, though he re
ceived two bullet wounds in what tK.
Price called "the mad dash lor liberty.
The doctor found the brave xrixie
on the street, escorted him home,
treated his wounds and retained him un
til "the period of convalescence was in
aueurated." Then Trixie went away,
nodding his melancholy ears at the doc
tor's suggestion to come around once,, a
day and ("receive * additional treatment.
And the next day accordingly Trixie did
appear, received " treatment and disap
peared. On one occasion came also the
reprehensible master. Ho made inquiry,
was informed and also disappeared, with
out loaning Trixie a* dollar to pay his
doctor' 3 bill. When the patient " was
cured he ceased his daily calls- Trixie,
said Dr. Price, was only one of many dogs
that he had met, only one of many unap
preciative animals that he had cared for
himself in the absence of a public shelter

Commissioner Trowbridge, who will

ing with all the packers and growers and
Boards of Horticulture in California.
The State Board of Trade has just issued
a staten ent, in which are set forth some
of the .-alien facts whicb show how neces
sary it is for California to be adequate^
represented at the great European exposi
tion.
Mr. Trowbridge, who made, frequent
visits to Germany, fives it as his opinion
that with proper efforts on the . part of
fruit-g.owers, the people within the Ger
man empire would buy at a profit through
the producers at least half the dried fruit
put up in California. â  a 4-,
The California State Board of Trade has
undertaken the work of presenting Cali
fornia's claims at that exposition. But in
order to succeed it must have the co-oper
ation of fruit-growers and some assistance
from every fruit county of the State.: It
asks that every organization interested in
fruit-growing take up this work at once,
so that a collection of fruit-food products
from each fruit county of the State may
be speedily obtained. A display from
each fruit- producing locality in California
at Hamburg will tend to emphasize the
extent of the industry in this State.
The collection should include, so _â¢ far
as practicable, dried fruits in variety,
raisins, canned fruits, canned vegetables,
jams, jellies, .wines, oils and nuts. It is
desired that, so far as convenient, these
goods should be of commercial grade and
put up in commercial packages, as it is
the intention tbat the display shall repre
sent such products as can be supplied in
quantity from a ton to a carload.
If not convenient to send the goods in
commercial packages the State Board of
Trade will have them packed in San Fran
cisco by experts in accordance with trade
regulations, and will brand and credit each
lot of goods to the locality that sends it.
Craigie Sharpe, secretary of the Oakland
Boar . oi Trade, James A. Filcher, B. N.
Rowley, E. W.Maslin and Mark L. Mc-
Donald have been appointed a finance
committee for the purpose of attending to
th.- expense of the exhibit.
They have carefully sized up the situa
tion and have issued the following memo
randum: .'â¢.-,'
Some financial assistance will- be expected
from each county, but it will be so little that
the amount will no doubt be readily appro
priated by tiie respective Boards of Super
visors on proper representation to tbem by
such committees as may be appointed forthe
purpose. From no one county .do we expect
more than $250, and this much only from
three or four of the largest and most directly
Interested. From this sum the amount will
vary down to $50.
The insignificance of these sums for an en
tire county, considering the great importance
of the work, will ,be apparent when it Is
stated that mercantile bouses in San Fran
cisco that are preparing :to send exhibits {to
Guatemala expect that it will cost each one of
them, exclusive of freivht and the value of
exhibit material, from $300 to $500.
A large commercial house .or packing com
pany desiring to send a special display of
their particular line of goods to Hamburg
will be expected to contribute toward the ex
pense. They can ascertain the amount by

Bishop Newman's Sermon
at the Howard- Street
Chnrch.
A Dissertation on Life, Suicide,
Homicide and Various Sins
and Crimes.
. *
An Immense Throng Gathered to Hold
"Watch Night" at the Close
of the Year.
At the Howard-street Methodist Episco
pal Church, W. W. Case pastor, there was
but scant room last night at the usual ser
vices closing with each year.
The regular choir was not present, but in
its stead other voices were raised in sacred
song. * *â¢
Professor Mar; in Schultz rendered Pen
lield's "Cuius Animatn" as an organ vol
untary.' Steams' "Father in Heaven*'
was sung by Mrs. W. E. Mayhew. Miss X.
Roberts aud S. Y. Wood. Miss Ester
Need ham of Oakland sang Vannah's solo
for contralto "Abide With Me." Gou
nod's soprano solo, "Ring Out, Wild
Bells" was rendered by Mrs. Martin
Schnltz.
Bishop Newman preached the watch
night sermon. It was a great effort and
held the congregation spellbound to the
close.
The text was from James iv:l4: "What
is your life?" The following is a synop
bis: â â¢ *
Life is a gift of God; the beginning of man's
immortality, the connecting link between the
past and the luture. It is a period of prepara
tion, also a period of termination.
It is a grand tiling to live. Whether in the '
ephemera of an hour or the eagle of & century,
the flower of a day or the yew tree of a thou
sand years, 'heinfant of a week or the man {
three score years and ten, life is a glorious
fact, .
Life is everywhere; it is the only thing of
which God seems prodigal. There is life in
the earth and on the earth, in the sea and on
the sea and throughout the vast expanse of
the atmosphere. There is life in the fungi, in
the lichen, in tbe blood-rain, in the fire that
sparkles on the summer sea, in the motes that
dance .n the sunbeam and in the dewdrr-pr-
Aurora's diamond. Give the microscopist
more light and he will reveal the existence of
more life. It is not possible to conceive of
life devoid of grandeur. Whatever may be the
misery incident to existence, to live is prefer
able to annihilation.
Among tne mysteries of life is what scholars
call the lea?e oi life. Ko general law has yet
---en discovered either in the animal or vege
table kingdom fixing this limitation. The
lease of life varies in animals and in plants.
In some it is a song, a thrill of love ; in others
. it sweeps througn the centuries. The average
lite of a rabbit is eight years, that of a dog i
â¢ twenty-four years, tbat of the sagacious and >
docile elephant 150 years; the raven that
croaks his coming lives througb the century, |
and the whale a century and a half. The !
, grains of wheat taken from the hands of a j
mummy terminate after 3000 years of cap- j
tivity. The somber cypress flourishes through ,
eight centuries, the cedars through 2000 years, ]
the yew tree through three milleniums. There
is at Calaveras, in California, one of .the
.Sequoia Gigantea big trees, as they are i
i sometimes called â that is 450 feet hien and !
100 feet in circumference. Tnat tree sprouted i
when Solomon was in his glory; it was in its I
prime when Rome was mistress of tbe world; â 
- it stood in its majesty when Christ was a babe
in Bethlehem.- --_-_**'â¢ â â â  'â â - - â¢â
What life is is one of the deepest of all mys- â .
teries. The answer has baffled the chemist, !
the biologist and . physiologist, who have i
toiled in vain on this splendid theme. But
the heart of nature's mystery has defied all
research. Bichat may say: "Life ie the sum
of the functions by which death is resisted."
Herbert Spencer may say: "Life is the con- i
ti noons adjustment of internal relations to i
external relations." Aristotle may say: "Life :
is the form of organism" ; but still we ask,
"What is lifer* Bichat merely tells us that
liie is not death; Spencer simply gives us the
signs of life; Aristotle gives us a fact, not a
definition. In a general sense we may say that
life attests its presence by certain signs.
As we now understand, life is fivefold
vegetable, animal, immaterial, spiritual and
eternal. Life in the vegetable kingdom Is in
dicated by secretion, absorption and reproduc
tion. When applied to animals its indications
are sensation, motion, procreation. Ascending
the scale to the higher animalâ manâ and in
addition to these characteristics of the lower
brute creation are the higher attributes ex
pressed by Intelligence, volition, consciousness.
That wnich we call the immaterial is differ
entiated from all lower forms of existence by
attributes which never characterize matter.
Life spiritual Is that harmonious relation in
which man lives in communion with his cre
otor, while life eternal is immortality of ex
istence in blissfalness of condition. But
whatever maybe our definitions, life seems
to be an impartation rather than Â« creation. .
There is but one life in the universe â the life I
oi God. The Scriptures are accurate in the as- :
sertion that "in him is Ine," which has adepth j
oi meaning to command our keenest thought i
end widest research. The old Hindus enter- i
tamed this loftier conception of life as an im
portation, and said that all human lives were
parts of the infinite .iie. and as drops of water
return to the ocean, so ali souls return to the
Infinite Father by absorption. Underlying this
description there is a deep thought, but by
them misunderstocu and misapplied, tor ti.
imparted live.-, whether of man orof angels,
wili retain their'individnality forever.
The Scriptural history is that after man's
body was" formed the Almighty inflated his
lungs and set hi- heart in motion by breath-
Ing into his nostril- the breath of bis animal
.lie, anl added thereunto that which we call
the soul, which is the changeless, immortal
life of man. This is the f.nal conclusion of
Darwin and Wallace, compelled to this con
clusion by Mivart, a Christian scientist. It
nay oe that some scholars, commonly called
atheists, have been misunderstood. Huxley
would say that protoplasm ls the basis of it--.
whicn is a fact; and Tyndall has said that all
lite is from antecedent life, which is an expres- .
sion of the nigbe-t .ruth. ..--*...-;
Bat lite is of immense importance primarily
to the Individual, secondly to society at iarge.
To the individual :it is the beginning of his
immortality, given ;or the : "noble purpose of
self-development and lor that probation from
which he is to enter upon the exalted state of
his blissful eternity. Who can contemplate a
thought so sublime- without placing the bigh
est value upon our mortal existence? And as
this life radiates the darkness of death it
fleshes its corruscations upon the materialism
of the day and lights up the tomb to the great
f y..ad. To the iudividual-life is the unfold
*''-''' his character. It is the accumulation
of those lorces which enter so largely into his
destiny, and to destroy such a lite is to inter
rupt the great process of nature and cheat
man of his malienabie rignt*.
Among civinzed men there are two estimates
oi tee importance and value of human exist
ence, one of vanity an contempt, the other of
dignity and power. The former estimate is
largely due to -.be deplorable fact that some
oi our best poets and essayists have given ex
pression to thoughts gioomv and contemptu
Â°" _ _
St Paul gives a more exal;ed view in those
memorable words, " For me l Â° live is Christ,"
and the Master's conception tt higher than
the highest when he declares "I must work the
works of him that sent me, while it is day;
the night cometh when no man can work
."â¢. . its grander aspect life is a web, time is ft
shuttle, man is a weaver. "My day* are swifter
a .\T Â£av r ' shuttle." The principle oi ac
tion's the thread in the. weo; but two things
are trueâ that which enters into the web will
reappear and nothing will reappear that has
not been placed '" the web by the deeds Â°*
Â ?< ur . tap ? Btry of life we may weave forms of
Justice, truth and holiness; of faith, hope and
charity; of saints, angels and God, and that
tapestry may coyer the walls of one mansion
of blesseane.s to excite the wonder and ad
miration of stunts and angels. Bat in that

The pictured side of life's web is turned toward
the infinite; that which is seen by us is often
amass of confused knots and colors. Some
fancy they are weaving angels; eternity will
reveal a devil. The Greeks have given us the
fable of the fatal sisters to illustrate the origin,
progress and termination of We. Ciotho held
the distaff and attached the thread of life;
Lachesis with the spindle spun off that thread;
and Atropis held a pair of scales to weigh the
thread a sun dial to measure its length, and
a pair of scissors to cut it off. These fatal sis
ters ever attend us. â  * * * â  .
The crime of homicide consists primarily In
three things: The destruction of the image of
Godâ for every man is God in miniature, pos
sessing the attribUies of the Creator in limita
tion and bears the likeness of the Almighty
in a spiritual and intellectual sense; for one
human being to lay his band upon another is
to lay that hand on the image of God and, in
a certain- sense, upon God himself. It is
usurpation of tbe prerogative of tne sovereign
of the universe, who has the right to create
and the right to destroy.. It is also the inter
ruption of the unfolding of that individuality
to which all have an unquestionable right,
and he who interrupts that unfolding com
mits a crime against man-kind. It is robbing
society of an individual life, the Influences of
which might have gone forth as so many
beneficent streams issuing from the fountain
of goodness. Society depends largely upon Its
individual component parts, out of which
come public opinion and public conscience.
It is thus the community is built up in its
multiform relations, its education is ad
vanced,' its religion is promulgated and civili
zation attains its loftiest results. By the pro
tection of the Individual society reaps the
golden harvest .of purity, charity and devo
tion. ____^>___B_B_)__Pfi___B*_
There is a looseness in public sentiment
touching the right of suicide. The great mas
ters of moral philosophy have borne no un
certain testimony against the right of self
destruction. There are times when despond
ency takes possession of men, when life seems
a failure, and when men say, "The fates are
against me"; that "life ls not worth living."
In such a supreme moment as this they dis
patch themselves into the presence of their
Creator unbidden, with life's, duties undone
and its responsibilities unmet. It Is a mistake
to suppose that suicide ls largely from coward
ice. The greatest characters in history have
thus ended their existence. â¢ * â¢ .
The Bible gives account of no thoroughly
good man who has dispatched himself, but the
great sufferers in biblical history have en
dured patiently, as when David says, "I
waited patiently for the Lord"; as when Jere
miah declares, "It is good that a man should
both hope and quietly wait"; as when St. Paul
triumphantly exclaims, "I reckon that the suf
ferings of this present time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory which shall be re
vealed in us."
Perhaps there is no part of that great epic,
the Boole of Job, that is more intensely affect
ing:"than when in his extreme agony, with
children gone, wealth gone, health gone, his
wife whispered, "Suicide, Job; curse God and
die." But, rallying in the grandeur of his
faith, he triumphantly exclaimed, "All the
days of my appointed time will I wait till my
change come." * ' * *
There is, nowever, a vaster sweep in this law
of life, comprehensive of those sanitary condi-,
j tions which are promotive of human existence.
i It is a startling tact that from one-third to one
; half of all persons born into the world die be
' fore reaching the age of five years. This ter
j rible reality, from another point of view, is
: more apparent in the fact that the child which
has completed Its filth year actually has an cx
i pectation of life more than twelve years great
jer than it had at its birth. The younger the
i child the larger is the death rate.
More than half of those who die under five
| "years of age die in their first year. in all the
â  ] great cities of our own country out of every
! one hundred live-born children about twenty
; five die before the end of the first year, and
| from forty to fifty before the close of the fifth
â¢ year. The diseases by which infancy is thus
j swept from the face of the earth are traceable
j to causes that have their remedy in a sanita
"â¢ tion by science. Among the fruitful causes of
i those earlier deaths are heredity, poverty,
exposure to cold and wet, excessive heat, im
. : proper feeding, filth ftid overcrowding. The
â ! common tenement- house in our great
' cities isthe charnel-house of infancy. What
! ever may be the advantages of great cities, the
death rate of infancy corresponds to th* den- i
sity of population. The remedy of* these j
i causes is within the reach of the wealthy, the
1 philanthropic and the scientific. Â» Â« *
This earth is a battlefield. The mounds of j
I Magenta and Solferino along the roadside be- !
j tween Turin and Venice are vast tombs !
i wherein sleep the heroic dead who died for j
, giory and for empire. Our earth is one vast I
i cemetery, filled with the victims of men who
I have plowed the fields with the plowshare of !
: destruction to gratify ther thirst for glory,
; but whose names will go down 10 posterity the
I synonym of infamy to be execra ed to the last ;
! generation of time as those born to be a curse [
| to virtue and mankind.
The verdicts of _ history are now being i
' changed. The warriors whose names once i
j awakened shouts of applause are now.regarded j
jas human monsters. Their sad end was mer- j
i ited by their bloody career. Behold the end of
! four of there greatest -warriors: Alexander >
j died ln a drunken revel at Babylon; Hannibal j
j committed suicide by poison in Bitnynia,
j Asia, unwept and unhoni red in a foreign land ;
Caesar was murdered in Rome at the base of j
) Pompey's Pilar; Napoleon died in exile on an '
i island in an unfrequented sea. The time will i
! come in the interest of a common humanity i
j and in obedience to this ancient law, "Thou j
I shslt not kill," when all nations shall revere
I its authority and bow obediently to its behe.ts. |
NEW FRENCH HOSPITAL.
A Noble Institution With the Latent
Medical and Surgical Appliances
Known to Science. '
The progressive and generous spirit of
the French residents of this City is fitly
represented by the great work of the
French Mutual Benevolent Society, the
erection of the magnificent new hospital,
occupying a healthful and commanding
site, 240 by 600 leet, on Point Lobos
avenue. It is accessible to cable and elec
tric cars and is only a few minutes' walk
from Golden Gate Park. Members of the
medical profession pronounce it unsur
passed for medical and hygienic purposes
in the United States. Every up-to-date
improvement for the well-being and com
fort of patients is iv successful operation
at the hospital.
The spacious grounds are admirably
adapted for the benefit of convalescents,
who receive the ocean's pure and health
giving ozone wafted from the near P.-.cific.
The medical staff is composed of men
eminent for skill in their special lines, as
follows:
Dr. H. B. de Marville is chief surgeon;
Dr. car J. Mayer, surgeon adjunct and
gynecologist; Dr. D. L. Bazet, genito
urinary diseases; Dr. Leo Newmark,
nervous diseases; Dr. C. G. Levison, path
ology; Dr. de Chantrean, treating physi
cian; Dr. E L. de Corval, visiting physi
cian ; Dr. K. Fischl, oculist and aurist;
D**. Louis E. Brun, dentist.
The officers and directors are: O. Bozio,
president; P. Carnes, first vice-president:
J. A. Bergerot, second vice-president; J.
Deschamps, recording secretary; Leon
Bocquer:-z, financial secretary; M. Fago
they, J. Bergez, J. P. Lartigan, T. Lacoste,
M. Fabreque, M. Coite, L. Carraine, F.
Queyrel, E. A. Lemoine, D. PolidorL
While the rates are $2 per day in the
wards and $3 and upward in private rooms
it may be remarked that the medical at
tention and service are the same to every
patient. At the hospital outside physi
cians are permitted to attend their own
cases, their :â  patients , receiving every ad
vantage of the institution.
Any person in health and under, 50
years of age can become a member of the
society on payment of a small, entrance
fee and $1 a month. Membership entitles
one to free treatment in case of illness,
either at home or at the hospital, and
free consultations from the doctors of the
society, which maintains two pharmacies,
where medicines are free to members. -
The most, careful supervision is exer
cised by the directors, two of whom make
daily visits to the hospital, y Dr. Pachex is
resident physician and there is a doctor in
attendance day and night to receive pa
tients, as well as three internes to take
care of tbem in the absence of the doctors.
A large number of people ; have entered
as life boarders. They have discovered
that no hotel or home can possibly furnish
the medical service, the scientific appli
ances and happy entourage to be found in
the New French Hospital. The great suc
cess and popularity of the hospital is due
in a great degree to the wise and careful
management of the board of directors.
Senator Hall's Seat Is Contested.
D. J. McCarthy has filed a contest against
Sidney Hall, Senator-elect from the Twenty

that the election officers in his district made a
great many errors, and Ihe adds that Mr. Hall
violated the purity of election law by spend
ing a great deal more money In his canvass
than the law allows. Henry Dibble Jr. Is at
torney for the contestant.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 1, 1897.
CALVARY'S CHAPEL
TO BE REMOVED
The Familiar Old Land
mark Will Soon
Disappear.
For Many Years It Stood at the
Cemetery Entrance on
Ellis Street.
In Its Place Will Be a Handsome
Lawn and Fenceâ lts Varied
History.
A familiar old landmark out at the end
of Ellis street is to be removed to give
way to modern improvements. In its
place will be a handsome lawn and an or
namental entrance-gate. The landmark
is the mortuary chapel in Calvary. Ceme
tery.
For many years this unpretentious
â -:'â '.-â¢ ;r;*.*' ; * â¢ y_S^_--"- 1.
rhe Old Church in Calvary Cemetery That Is to Be Removed
frame structure has stood at the end of
El is street, where that thoroughfare ter
minates near the entrance to the ceme
tery, and has commanded a broad view of
tbe Western Addition from its -elevated
site. Immediately after the holidays steps
wi.l be taken to either move the chapel to
some other location or to tear it down. It
i.as been condemned, in fact, as some
thing of the past, and not an ornamental
structure at the cemetery entrance, where
first impressions are received of Calvary
burial-ground.
Other cemeteries in the viciuity have
been steadily improved in appearance by
the removal of old - fashioned wooden
structures and the substitution of artistic
buildings, by planting hedgerows . and
fencing with concrete walls. So that they
are now really handsome parks, at least
in the portions round tbe mam entrances.
For some time past Calvary has been un
dergoing a general transformation. On
the Geary-street side concrete walls 'have
been constructed and sidewalks laid, and
an ornamental fence bas been run along
the easterly boundary on Broderick street.
Inside, the gra.splats have been enlarged
and the grounds otherwise improved in ap
pearance.
The removal of the chapel will open a
vista of green lawns and shrubbery beside
the main entrance for carriages. For some
time it has been regarded as a defect that
marred the effect of recent alterations.
The little church building has a varied
i.istory. Originally it was intended for a
chapel wherein services could be held over
the remains of people to be interred in
Calvary Cemetery. For a time . lt served
as a church for Holy Cross parish, before
the present parish church on Eddy street
was moved out to Eddy and Scott streets.
Then the congregation of Holy. . Cross
worshiped in the new church, but as there
were not sufficient accommodations â¢ for
Sunday-school classes in it, the pastor,
Father McGinty, utilized the building at
Calvary gates for Sunday-school purposes.
The children of the parish have met there
every Sunday morning for ' religious in
struction, and still continue to do so, and
will hold their New Year and Christmas
festival there next ' Sunday for the last
time.;
As soon as the building is removed the
children will meet at the parish church
between the hours of divine service Sun
day mornings and there receive instruc
tion in their faith.
There will not be a new mortuary
chapel in Calvary Cemetery to take the
place of the one about to" be taken down.
It is not needed now, and in fact the old
building has not been used as such of late.
The reason for this is a new order regard
ing Catholic funeral services in San Fran
cisco. When a funeral takes place from
the parish church with a requiem mass in
the .morning a priest accompanies the
body to the grave, where .prayers; for the
dead are recited. And if there is no requiem
mass the office of the dead is said by a
priest in the parish church.

The Society of California Pioneers Hold
a New Tear's Eve Reception.
Pioneer Hall was crowded with the pick
of the City j last evening. The occasion
was a New Year's eve reception given by
the Society of California Pioneers to the
members and their friends. '.- From the ap
pearances - every invitation was accepted
and a most enjoyable time was had.
The hall was beautifully decorated,
potted plants, ferns and flowers, banners
and flags setting off the ballroom in a
most attractive way. The affair was mi
i formal to a very large extent. This was
particularly so with regard to the enter
tainment Between the dances those who
felt disposed added to the pleasure by
songs, recitations and stone*. Miss Flor
ence Fairchilds was called upon twice to
sing an i she freely responded. J. B.
Swan told several of his original dialect
stories ; Miss Teresa Cleveland gave a
recitation and W. H. Barnes delivered a
short address. ; v;
Several others also contributed to the
entertainment. The affair was under the
management of the following gentlemen:

THE CATHEDRAL
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
Archbishop Riordan Speaks
to His People in Elo
* quent f Strain. â¢
He Gives Words of Good Advice
and Points Out the Way
of Life.
The Congregation Sings in English
the Beaut fal Hymn, "0
Holy God!;:
For the second time in San Francisco
the congregation of St. Mary's Cathedral
blended their voices in sinking last even
inc. A year ago the first attempt at con
gregational singing was made after the
sundown of the old year, but the chant on
that occasion was timid and Jacked the
spirit and feeling which made the effect of
last night's hymn exceedingly impressive.
The whole congregation joined in the "Te
Deum," in English, "0. Holy God I" and
the hymn was sung in English as follows:
Holy God, we praise thy name!
Lord of all, we bow before thee I .
All on earth thy scepter claim,
All in heaven abo v.? adore thee;
Infinite thy vast domain,
Everlasting is thy name.
Hftr-K.' tbe loud celestial hymn,
; Angel choirs above are Biasing
Cherubim and seraphim
In unceasing chorus praising, _â '-'- r
' Fill the heavens with sweet accord, '
Holy, hoy, holy Lord.
. i
Holy Father, holy Son,
Holy spirit, three we name thee
While In essence only one,
Undivided God we claim thee
And adoring bend tbe knee
While we own the mystery.*
The services were commemorative of
New Year's eve, when thanksgivings are
offered for 'he graces and benefits of the
year and good resolves are formed for the
coming one. St. " Mary's ' Cathedral was
crowded in every part. Christmas decora
tions of palms and masses of evergreen
with bunches of the scarlet glory pea
grouped about the magnificent white
marble altar still graced the sanctuary,
which, was dazzling in . its brilliancy.
Thousands of lights in candelabra lent
their luster to the > peculiar beauty of the
scene, and the whole - interior was glori
ously illuminated.
Solemn vespers began at 7:30 p. M. They
were chanted by the Rev. Father Ramm.
Handel's Pastoral Symphony was given '
as a prelude by Professor Harrison on the
grand organ, and then the psalms' were
sung to Gregorian chant. Aloys Werner
sang Adam's "Noel" as a tenor solo. The
psalms were rendered by the cathedral
chorus under the direction of Rev. Jerome
B. Haniugan. '"
Archbishop Riordan delivered a beauti
ful sermon bearing .': especially on the
going, and coming of the. years. His
Grace's address partook more of the na
ture of advice and exhortation to his flock
than it was sermonlike. His words' were
directed to the hearts of his people, and
so fittingly that they reached every one.
He saio that when the old year is about
to close and the new one is at hand it is
well for all to look back over the past year,
and see if a . lesson can be gathered from
its-diversified days. A deep lesson would
be found therein if people would taxe it to
heart, and here the Archbishop presented
a very happy and striking simile of man
being cast in a loom and a man's heart
as a shuttle. As it : moves io and fro
through the loom the heart picks up
sometimes darkness, sometimes bright
ness. N&_M____B_|___-_A'__-__fÃÃ
And out of men's dark days and bright
days Almighty God is weaving a garment
of beauty fit to adorn the walls of the
celestial home. __kas__aE_____gPft___K^^l**'s
The Apostle Paul says all things work
to the good of mau. He looKs over human
things to say that they are all good; that
they are all useful, all . have a certain
value. Are they valuable to all people ?
No. He does not say that all things are
good for all men. Nothing has any abso
lute value, things are: only a means to
something that is good, and ail depends
on the use made of them. St. Paul means
good that endures; the good tnat affects
souls, and which men shall carry with
them into eternity, the goodness of God
as reflected in human life. â¢
In human things as in divine, love is
the prime force of our natures. If man
loves the noble and the good he is moving
In the direction of what is noble and
good. : '"Show me what a man loves,"
said his Grace, '.'and I will! tell you what
he is. Unless .we have love in our hearts,
unless it penetrates our natures, it is not
of the kind that would save our souls."
The Archbishop told his hearers that in
the brief time still, remaing of the old
year enough pure repentance could be
thrown into it to atone for deeds of the
past. To Christian people, the closing
moments of the year come with a solemn
pathos. ' It was well at this* time to ask
how the year was spent. .-,...
On looking back too little of the spirit
ual will be found, and our faith has been
strong only in words. "Let as turn and
greet - this new year," he added, "witn
firm resolutions of virtue, meet it at Chris
tian people and say that what is left to us
shall be spent as Christian children should
live. ''Â»'^-*-^^'^l^*^!^S_Â®Bi?_E__BH____i
"Let us begin our days aa Christian peo
ple should with at least a short prayer,
think of our divine Lord _ during the day,
and at night in prayer thank him for his
graces; go to mass on Sunday and' to our
duties." '' " - -
After the sermon the Archbishop offi
ciated at benediction with the blessed sac
rament,; assisted by Fathers Bam m : and
Byrne and Key. P. Mulligan as master of
ceremonies. Miss Remington of St. Louis
made her first appearance here. She is a
soprano, with a rich â voice, full of power
and dramatic beauty, and her singing of
Millard's Aye Maria was an exquisite in
terpretation of the beautiful hymn. The
choir sang the -.Balu_aris".and "Tantum
Ergo," after which, the congregation sang
the Te Deun__. The choir was as follows:
Miss Grace Remington, solo soprano; Miss
Mac Corlett, alto; A. Werner, ! tenor; â â  big. A.

LEVIN BROTHERS' DEBTS
Board of Trade Adjusters in Each
of the Firm's Four
Stores.
The Levin failure was the talk in mer
cantile circles yesterday. During the
afternoon the Board of Trade sent out this
notice:
San ncisco, Dec. 31, 1896. .
To the Creditors of Livin Bros., San Fi ancisco
and Oakland, CaLâ Gentlemen : Your com
mittee, appointed at the reguiar meeting of
creditors, beg to report that they have secured
assignment irom Levin Bro*. to Jacob Levi Jr.,
A. L. Whitney and J. P. Edoff of all their prop
erty, aud now have adjusters in each of the
four stores, with the Berkeley store closed up,
its stock being moved to Oakland/
We shall furnish you with a full statement
of affairs within a few days, and, at the same
time, advise further with you as to the best
course to adopt. Very respectfully,
J. Levi Jr., A. L. Whitney, Jesse W. Lilien
thal, Louis Getz, J. P. Euoff, M. Samuel, J. J.
Schuti, committee.
Several leading creditors were inter
viewed yesterday for The Call, and the
opinion was expressed that the assets oi
the firm would not produce more than 40
per cent of the indebtedness. A repre
sentative of a prominent house said that
his firm would cheerfully accept 20. per
cent of its account with Levin Bros.
The adjusters of the board have now
control of Levin Bros.' main store and the
branches. An immediate inventory of the
goods in hand and an examination of the
books of such store will be made. Nothing
of a definite character regarding the value
of tbe assets can be obtained before Mon
day next.
Merchants who have seen the checks
representing the payments of $30,000 to
creditors between November -23 and De
cember 26 say that the last large payment
was made to H. Levi & Co, The next
largest check was one for $1700 in favor of
C. E.Whitney & Co.
'It is remarked as creditable _to the
Levins that they have surrendered all
their property, money in bank, real estate
and lite-insurance policies for the benefit
of their ; creditors. The Anglo-California
Bank, a creditor to the amount of $33,000,
is secured to some extent by an equity in
real estate on which the German Savings
Bank holds a mortgage. C. E. Whitney
& Co. are secured in a measure by as
signed insurance policies.
A representative of a leading firm on
Market street says that Jacob : Levi was
perfectly lair and just in his appointment
of the committee. It was according to
custom and right that Mr. Levi presided
at the meeting Wednesday, as his house
was the largest creditor. When a request
was made to him that the dealers in dairy
products . should have representation .on
tbe committee he readily assented and ap
pointed tbe merchants whose names were
suggested.
There were no startling developments in
the Levin failure yesterday. In the fore
noon a number of creditors held a meet
ing â â  at the Board , of Trade rooms. The
future action of the creditors was dis
cussed in a general way, but it was decided
to do nothing until after a report of the ad
justers, which is expected to be filed on
Tuesday. The main . and branch stores
were in charge of accountants yesterday,
and the work of making an inventory
proceeded without delay.
Julius Levin yesterday sent the follow
ing letter to The Call:
To the San Francisco Call: The report pub
lished in the daily press of an interview had
with me and relating to the losses sustained
by my firm, in so far as it reflects
upon . the Integrity of * any of our . em
ployees, does .both them ana me a
great Injustice. Nothing was â¢ further * from
my thoughts than to call in question the in
tegrity of our gent employees, whose fidel
ity to our interests, and strict integrity, have
always commanded our fullest confidence and
appreciation. Julius Levin.

them.
We ought to begin this winter the fight

The proposal to erect at Washington an
arch of California fruit over one of the

be merit in it. At any rate. it will be an
other means of surprising the East with
our arch ways. , , .. ,
The deep interest taken by Washington
in the -Mothers' Congress to be held in
that city in February inclines to the belief
that the people of the capital have a fond
hope the mothers will take the boys of
the other Congress off J their old tracks by
a few well-applied switches.
Among the Congressional novelties of
the season is the introduction of a joint
resolution to amend the constitution so
that terms of Eepresentatives shall be in
creased to four years, of Senators to eight
years, and of the President to eight, lt is
supposed the business interests of the
country will support the measure in order
to get a rest from frequent elections,' but
business will remember Cleveland and the
cuckoo Congress and prefer to keep the
right to make a clean sweep once in two
years. y â ,
A HAPPY NEW YEAB. ...
With glowing anticipations of better
things and with resolutions so to act as to
speed their coming, men and women of
the civilized world will greet the New
Year's day. It matters not if the sky be
overclouded by storms of wind or rain or
snow, it will be, nevertheless, to the great
majority of us all a bright ami happy new
year.
The day will draw its brightness less
from any sunshine it may radiate than
from the luminous prospects which the
mind can discern upon the horizon. On
this day pessimism will bo banished and
every intellect will seek only for those
signs which promise good to nations and
to men. Such signs will not be lacking in
any country nor to any class of people.
The kindly earth is full of promises to
man, and Mother Nature gives assurance
that these promises will hs fulfilled to all
who obey her laws and work in accordance
with her rules. Bright, therefore, will be
the day in every land brighter in America
than to others, and brightest of all in
California.
The happiness of the day will depend
upon the heart which receives the in
fluences of the good prospects around.
There are people who would be sad even
in the halls of heaven, as there are others
who would find cause of rejoicing under
the most gloomy conditions. It is the
latter class to whom the day will be a
happy one, no matter whether the sun
shines or the rain falls. They will see in
the abundant promises of nature a thou
sand opportunities for their own advance
ment, and they will with resolute minds
and cheerful hearts determine to make of
them the beet use and profit.
- Surely the people of California and of
the United States generally have good
reason to be well satisfied with tbe out
look. Our country is to-day more pro
pitious to men than any other on earth,
and our State offers more encouragement
to industry and enterprise than any other
in our country. As a Nation we are so
powerful that we can not only command
peace for ourselves but can go far toward
securing it for others. As a State we are
so prosperous that we can not only fur
nish our own people with abundance but
out of the profusion of our crops can ex
port much of those products of the .soil
which in less favored lands are counted as
luxuries.
Under these circumstances our people
have a thousand inducements to the mak
ing of good resolutions. ' It needs but lit
tle reflection to discern that wherever we
have failed in the past the failure has
been largely due to defects ! in ourselves.
In our individual undertakings we have
not put forth our full strength or exerted
all the virtue that is in us. In our public
enterprises we have not co-operated with
a complete cordiality or made use of the
full force of our united strength. There
fore to attain in the coming year the re
alization of what we now anticipate there
is needed more than anything, else a de
termination to reform ourselves and to
act m the work of the coming year with a
greater individual vigor and more ol pub
lic spirit and general harmony.
Tee Call, speaking for all, wishes for
California a Happy New- Year. It desires
that the coming twelve months shall have
more of realization than of disappoint
ment. It sec 3in the advantages of the
State a thousand opportunities for public
and private advancement. It wishes all
of these opportunities to be used to the
fullest extent and the advancement to be
.carried forward to a degree of prosperity
which shall assure the welfare of all. It
therefore urges the adoption of good
resolutions which will tend to promote
every rightly directed effort of the indi
vidual will, and every enterprise which
either civic pride, State interest or Na
tional patriotism may induce us to under
take.
STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
The impetus given to street improve
ments by the splendid accomplishments
in street lighting during the last few
months will undoubtedly be continued
into the coming year and promises re
sults far greater than even the most san
guine anticipated a comparatively short
time ago. Progressive merchants and
property-owners along a large number of
our principal streets have shown an ability
to co-operate which has not only accom
plished much in the past but gives assur
ance of even greater things in the future.
There is hardly any feature of our civic
life during the past twelve months which
can be regarded with more satisfaction
than what has been done in the way of
better street lighting. We have seen our
principal thoroughfares almost trans
formed in this respect within a time com
paratively short. We have seen moreover
a manifestation of public spirit and a
comprehension of the advantage of merg
ing individual profit into the general
good which gives assurance that we shall
never again, for some time to come at any
rate, have to complain of a lack of public
spirit among our people or of enterprise
among the owners of our real estate.
There is no direction In which this pub
lic spirit could have been more profitably
directed than in that of street improve
ments. Our thoroughfares bave long been
the main defect of our City. While we
have progressed in many ways and kept
pace with the most important cities in
the Union in many important respects we
have fallen far short of them in the man
agement of our streets. We are still to a
large extent in the cobblestone age of
street work, while they have gone for
word to asphalt or other pavements of
equal merit. We need a new awakening
on this subject, and the better lighting
which progressive merchants have fur
nished us has prepared the way for it. *
San Francisco needs street improve
ments of all kinds. Our thoroughfares
should be not only better lighted, but bet
ter swept, better paved and better sewered.
We have begun the work of some of these
improvements and should not rest until
we have accomplished them all. The
spirit manifested by progressive citizens
sbould show itself among those who are
entrusted with municipal authority. The
new year should begin an era of better
street work, which will assure 4us thor
oughfares equal to those of any city in
the Union. This is one of * the hopes
which will most strongly animate people
generally with the beginning of the new
year, and there will be grievous' disap
pointment if we do not approach near to a
complete realization of it before the twelve
months are over.
OALIFOENIA PEOSPEOTS.
As far as California is concerned, the
prospects are exceptionally, bright. It is
the current phrase among farmers that
thus far the season has bsM "made to
order." A larger acreage has been tmt in
to grain .than ever before, and the crop
prospects at present are brilliant. The
rains have occurred at convenient inter
vals, and there has been abundance of
warm sunshine to help the plant along.
Green grain fields are now showing all
over the State, and if no untoward event
occurs the crop of 1897 will be immense;
Nor is this all. Present conditions extend
a reasonable assurance that prices for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; FRIDAY, JANUARY 1. 1897.
grain during the coming year will be first
class. .Wheat is worth $1 50 to-day and it
is not. expected to fall much below this
figure between now and harvest. '-.to
those acquainted wiih the wheat trade
$1 50 for wheat to-day is equivalent to $2 a
few years ago, and when wheat sold at $2
the farmers were about the most prosper
ous class in the State. And everybody
knows that when the farmer prospers
everybody else does well.
Nor does wheat alone extend encourage
ment. Fruit is expected to be a profitable
crop in 1897, for last year's crop was not
heavy, and dealers expect that it will be
wholly cleaned up when the new crop
comes forward, so there will be no large
left-over stock to stand iii the way of good
prices. The well-known attitude of the
Republican party, on wool, too, is more
than encouraging to the wool-grower, who
now sees light ahead for this grossly
abused and almost extinguished industry.
Wine, also, is bringing a better price than
for years, and this brightens the - outlook
for the vineyardist, and raisins sold off
liKe hot cakes during September, 1 October
and November at profitable prices, thus
reviving the drooping spirits of the almost
discouraged grower. Mining, likewise, is
remarkably active, and large amounts of
capital have recently been invested in it.
Money is abundant, and present indica
tions are that it will be more accessible in
1&97 than for some years past. Thus the
State, as well as the Nation, is emerging
from depression into prosperity.' .__.*._.â .'
This is the outlook, and it bids fair to
be realized. From all signs at the moment,
the year 1897 will be successful to the
capitalist, merchant and farmer, and thus
to the State and country at large. ...-
THE OUTLOOK POE 1897.
It is the general belief among finan
ciers and business men throughout the
United States that the Ist of January,
1897, will mark a turning point in the
commercial record of the country. We
have lately passed through one of the
most trying financial epochs in our his
tory. Prices for most commodities have
touched the lowest point ever known.
Agriculture and manufacturing have
been depressed and trade lias been at a
standstill. That normal speculation,
reasonably confined, which always ac
companies a- healthy condition of trade'
has been diminished almost to the point
of extinction. In fact, there has been no
speculation of any consequence for several
years, and while the mints have/coined
more money than usual and the vaults of
banns and other financial- depositories
have been heavily supplied with funds, it
has been almost. impossible to obtain
capital with which to embark upon. new
enterprises. This gloomy state of affairs
for several years was due to nothing else
than a general want' of confidence. '"
But new conditions have "arisen to
change all this and create activity and
confidence out of stagnation and distrust.
For several months the outlook has been
steadily improving. It was Known, about
the middle of last September, that the
success of the Republican party at the
polls would accomplish more in the way
of stimulating commerce than any other
agency, and as soon as the public became
satisfied of this fact business improved as
if by magic Lines that had languished
became active; a disposition to invest in
safe enterprises became manifest; money
became more accessible and at more reaon
able rates of interest; mills that had been
idle for months started up; prices for
many commodities advanced, and with
this appreciation appeared a rush to buy
goods and replenish depleted stocks; and,
in short, the whole financial and com
mercial complexion of the country under
went an almost complete transformation.
The rising tide of prosperity was by no
means confined to the more densely popu
lated sections of the East. It was felt in
California in unmistakable form. It
showed itself in renewed activity in wool,
hops, dried fruits, hides, leather, provi
sions, wheat, barley and flour, and, in
brief, in almost ail of the principal staples.
The purchases of wool, wheat, raisins
and dried fruits were enormous, and this
immense commercial current continued
until the approach of the holiday season,
when business quieted down all over the
world. But while it lasted we did a fine
business. r
The lull is the usual December relaxa
tion, and is probably . temporary. It is
generally expected that the turn of the
year will witness a revival that will usher
in a new period of prosperity, which may
last for some years. There is widespread
confidence that the incoming administra
tion, if not fettered by pernicious partisan
opposition, will place American trade on l
a permanently prosperous footing. Re- 1
invigorated by this belief, the commercial
elements of the country are already
making their plans for lively times
ahead. All signs point in that
direction. The balance of foreign
trade, so long against us, is now in our
favor, and London has actually been bor
rowing from New York by drawing bills
against credit, the transactions on this
account having footed up an enormous
total. Indeed, these credits and the ex
port bills now held in Now York 'make a
total of 135,000,000. This is expected to
offset the. adverse balance of trade that
usually appears in the first quarter of the
year, hence it is not expected that we
shall export any quantity of gold during
the next three months.
;',:,. Every; business man. understands what
this means. It signifies that more gold is
coming into the United States than is
going out. lt means that we . are selling
more goods to Europe than -Europe is sell
ing to us. It means just so much more
money in circulation in the United States;
just so much more confidence, and conse
quently just so much more willingness on
the part of capital to lend itself to new
enterprises. The effect of this will be far
reaching. Trade will be stimulated in all
quarters of the country, and not a nook or
corner will' fail to feel the electric thrill of
renewed confidence.
ETJEOPEAN AFPAIES. .
. The sanguine- men and women
among the peoples of Europe can doubt
less find in their environment a multitude
of reasons for expecting a happy and pros
perous New Year. They can hardly con
ceal from themselves, however, that grave
dangers threaten; the permanence of the
existing truce among the nations, and
that before the close of the year ail Europe
may be involved in a war which will carry
â¢mourning and grief into thousands of
households.
! The Turkish crisis, which a few weeks
ago seemed near a solution, was never in
a more dangerous condition than at '; pres
ent. After years of disagreement the
three great powers, Great Britain, France
and Bussia, have succeeded in uniting
upon . a â¢ plan v of \ reform "â¢ in "the Ottoman
empire, but now the Sultan of Turkey
positively refuses to accept the â¢: terms -.' of
fered him, and finds, either from some
European nation- or bis own despair, a
strength to defy the ; allies and to insist
upon' holding the course which for so long
a time has been an offense to humanity.
Whether" the Turk is relying upon prom
ised aid from Germany, or whether in bis
mi i i â ! in â â "â  â !â  i iii i liirT -lin iMifmani*- â¢hinigr-T' iiii_iHTHii-- l -in."-iii- *__* "vi, ii-ira..
barbarism he has resolved to die righting,
rather than yield tamely to the domina
tion of his enemies, matters very little to
the crisis which confronts Europe. > In
either case the fact remains the same. The
allied powers who have the greatest inter
est at stake have demanded of the Sultan
certain concessions, and he, for the pres
ent at least, has positively refused to con
cede them. The issue therefore is one of
imminent war, and this constitutes â 'â &â ,
heavy cloud over the welfare of the world
on this New Year's morning.
The diplomacy of Europe is conducted
mainly by a hidden hand. The world had ;
a startling proof of that a few months ago
when it was made known that even at the
time when the triple alliance was formed
between . Germany, Austria and Italy
Prince Bismarck had entered into a secret
treaty with Russia which bound _ him to
be false to his Austrian and Italian allies
whenever it was necessary for himsell and
his secret Russian friend to act together
for their mutual â¢'â¢* interests. With this
revelation fresh in the minds of men there
can be no great degree of confidence in
the permanence of the present alliances. ;
Germany, while professing to be the
friend of Turkey, may be really co-operat
ing with other powers, and Russia, while
avowedly in alliance with j Great Britain
and Francs, may be preparing schemes
directly hostile to their interests.
It is conceded that every nation in Eu
rope desires peace, but nations no more
than individuals, can attain their desires
unless the policy of their conduct is wisely
directed with a full understanding of all
the conditions around them. It is more
than doubtful if there exists a single
statesman in Europe to-day who knows or
even believes that he knows all the forces
that are operating in the direction of war.
This condition of affairs leaves almost
everything to chance and the be_t that
the statesmen of Europe can do is to put
tbeir nations on guaid . and strengthen
their forces for. the coming conflict.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
I Professor H. A. Ward, the scientist who â  has
been exploring the Great Barrier Reel off the
coast of New Zealand, and who .arrived at the
California ja; few days ago, has had a curious
career. He came to this State in the early days
and examined ' different | places ' for gold.
Finally vhe ; got a stampmill made at the old
iron foundry of which the Union Iron Works
is the outgrowth, and set off with it to Utah. .
; He did not make a sufficient fortune to en
able him to withdraw from the pursuits of an
active life, but having scholarly tastes ne set
tled down as professor of natural sciences at
Rochester University in New York. â  A little
later he got tired of holding; this position and
proceeded to establish a sort of museum of
natural science.
This was over forty years ago. and the Insti
tution has been open and running ever since.
It was to help keep it going that the scientist,
now gray-bearded,- made his long trip to the
Great Barrier Reel He was collecting corals
in and about there,' and was particularly for
tunate in getting a large lot. , i
The professor also got shells, warclubs and
various other things which he picked up
along the coast. It is a new and unique coun
try for explorations, the veteran traveler says.
The bronzed natives, who dig holes In the
sand and hunt for bugs and worms, were In
teresting to him, though he says "that they are
noways high in the Intellectual scale.
However, they are exceedingly cunning and
handy withal with their boomerangs. They
propel them a wonderful distance and with
great accuracy. rJ ii__^__rt^i^^_*_|Bffl^-|
The professor visited New Guinea while ab
sent The natives of the southwest shore are
much like those of West Australia about Cook
town. The scholar "had no use for any of
them.;' :â¢ ' '.v-v^?'- 'â 'â '.â '3' *â (''-'â â â 
"When we were away on tbe coast we never
ventured to them," he said, "unless we had
loaded revolvers in our hands. It would not
do to do otherwise. The natives 'were too
treacherous to trust. They frequently kill
while men and on the slightest provocation.
Robbery is one of their principal objects."
. Professor Ward has already been away from
home a long time, so he will not tarry here
long. He will soon go to Rochester with the
aggregation of - queer things that he has
gathered. ,

How the Ship America Went Ashore at
San Pedro.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
In your issue of to-day 1 note asiatement over
the signature of C. F. Swan, master of bark
Theobald, where he says the ship America
went on dhore at San Pedro with one anchor
on the bow and no crew on- board. When the
gale came on from southeast, knowing the ex
posed position of the ship, every precaution
was token to hold her to her anchors. The
second anchor was let go with a good spread,
and not foul, as. the captain stated. As the
gale Increased the stream and kedge anchors
were let go with hawsers attached. , In the
height of the gale the port chain parted and
the ship began to drag. In giving more chain
on starboard anchor the. compressor lost con
trol of the windlass and tbe , chain goiug oul
with great force : carried . away . the . two-inch
bolt which fastened it to the keelson. Of
course, the chain went overboard. When the
ship struck the reef she had not an anchor
left. The crew consisted of fifteen men, offi
cers included (her sen complement being
twenty-five), a force sufficient to handle the
anchors. The writer's experience of twenty
five years as master has taught him. better
than to jeopardize - the ship's insurance and
owners' property by such a lubberly trick as
letting his ship drive on shore. with his an
chors on the bow in a port like San Pedro.

LOWER RATES
FOR PILOTAGE
A Reform Will Be Agitated
in the Next Legis
lature.
Problems Â°in Navigation Dis
cussed by the Committee
on Commerce.
A Clause to Exempt Steam Craft
With Special Pilots Frcm
General Pi age.
An important and enthusiastic meeting
of the committee on commerce was held
yesterday afternoon in the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce, the vice-president,
Hueh Craig, presiding.
The secretary, Charles E. Naylor, gave
an extended report of the work of the
officers during the past eight months,
which has been entirely educational and
preparatory. The treasurer, George. E.
Plummer, rendered a financial statement
showing a large sum of ready cash in the
treasury and no liabilities to meet. â¢
The main business of the meeting was
the consideration of proposed legislation
in the interest of ocean shipping. A re-
port on the pilotage question by a sub
committee was read and . tne following
recommendations were referred to a special
legislative committee with instructions to
prepare suitable bills for presentation to
the Legislature:
. Firstâ Reducing the maximum rate of pilot
age from $5 to $3 per foot draught. <â  â¢
Secondâ The number of general pilots to be
reduced to a maximum of ten.
Thirdâ The masters of all tug boats regularly
cruising the waters of this bay and the ap
proaches thereto, the masters of all steamers
and steam craft regularly trading with this
port, and tbe masters of all American sailing
vessels regularly tr.ding with this port, to be
examined by the Pilot Commissioners and
licensed as special pilots.
Fourthâ Any sailing vessel or other craft in
tow of a tug having as master a licensed special
pilot, to be exempt from all pilot fees unless a
general pilot be actually employed. * .
Fifthâ Steam craft under the command of a
master licensed as a special pilot to be exempt
from all pilot fees, unless a general pilot be
actually employed.
Sixthâ Any sailing vessel under the com
mand of a master licensed as special pilot to
be exempt from all pilot fees, unless a general
pilot be actually employed.
Seventhâ Every master examined by the
Pilot Commissioners and granted a special
license to pay a fee of $10.
Eighthâ A special pilot license granted to
the master of any tug, steamer or sailing ves
sel shall entitle the holder to act as pilot for
the vessel for which the license is granted
only; masters duly licensed to act as special
pilots for one vessel may, however, have their
license transferred to act for another vessel
upon the payment of a fee $1. â¢ ,
Ninth â A provision making it a misde
meanor, with proper penalty, for pilots .to
make any discrimination in the collection of
pilot fees, or to pay any rebates except such
as are expressly provided for by law.
Tenthâ A provision requiring the Pilot Com
missioners to make each year to the Governor
of the State a full report of all the pilotage
collected, with other necessary statistics.
After the pilotage question was dis
posed of the 'meeting adopted a resolu
tion asking the Legislature to submit to
the electors of the State a constitutional
amendment removing the State and local
tax from ocean-going ships, and I directed
that a petition be circulated for signatures
of business houses favoring such a meas
ure.
A resolution was also adopted favoring
the repeal of State quarantine laws for
the reason that the Federal Government
has a complete inspection system at this
port, and provides a station with every
safeguard against the invasion of infec
tious diseases.
The legislative committee will prepare
bills and make a vigorous effort to have
them passed by the Legislature, a major
ity of the members of which they teel
sure will not be influenced by the silvery
arguments generally presented by the
opposition to pilotage reform legislation.

Mate Anderson Held the

Intruders.
Three Would-Bs Masters Were
Ejected From the Sharpshooter
Without Ceremony.
Anderson and One of His Victims
Were Picked Up in the Bay by
..'.'â  a Boat's Crew. '_
The old barkâ now barkentlneâSharp
shooter is once more in trouble. Just what
is the matter no one seems to know, but
it is a fact nevertheless that she is always
in trouble. As a bark she was on her way
here' from South American ports with a
general cargo, when she was dismasted in
the Gulf of California and drifted out to
sea. Later she was picked up and towed
to San Francisco. The hull was sold at
auction, and the vessel was repaired at
considerable cost and turned into a bark
entine. She was leaded for Sydney, but
Captain Kustel bad to put back on ac
count of the leaking decks. The cement
put over the seams had washed off and
the vessel took in considerable water. Tbe
return trip from New South Wales was a
long one, and as the voyage did not pay
expenses and the prospects were not bright
the vessel was tied up in Oakland Creek.
â¢ Chiistmas day Captain Kustel went
ashore and left Mate Anderson in charge.
The latter went to a neighboring ves
sel to have a holiday drink, and in
the meantime one of the owners
went aboard. Anderson put in an ap
pearance a few minutes later and
ordered the stranger ashore. He refused
to _;o and asserted his ownership. The
mate laughed, and taking bim by the ear
walked bun ashore. Anderson is a Swede
and stands six feet in his stockings.
The owner went away vowing venge
ance, and at once 'sent down a man to
lake charge of the vessel. â¢ When. he dis
played his authority Anderson said:
"Captain Kustel is master of this ship,
and he left me in charge. You must bring
an order from him be. ore I move."
The new captain attempted to assert bis
right, but Anderson without ceremony
walked him ashore. A second man was
sent down, but he also was worsted, and
When a third put in an appearance tnere
was a free fight. During the squabble
both Anderson and , the new captain fell
overboard. The men on the whaling bark
Lydia saw the disturbance and the de
nouement and at once went to their assist
ance. Both .men were, hauled out .and
dried, and when* they returned to the
â  Sharpshooter Captain Kustel was in com
! mand. 'â¢' ' .' -...â¢â¢.
Later on Captain Peterson, late of the
brig Lurline, assumed command.
Anderson was told by Captain Kustel to
! allow no one aboard without his permit
! and he followed his orders to the letter. '
| Captain Kustel will assume command of
| one of tbe Australian packets in a few
days, and it is safe to say that Anderson
will be his chief officer. The Sharpshooter
is one of the handiest and speediest' boats i
that sails in and out of San Francisco, but
just what will be done with her is prob
lematic. â¢ '""..â

Sergeant Tom Mahoney of the harbor
police was a proud man "yesterday. Phil
S. Beei presented him with a magnificent
' new badge as a New Year's present. It is
of solid silver and tie words "Sergeant of
Police" are in blue enamel. The' number
56 is in raised gold figures, and the whole
makes a unique and handsome badge.
Sergeant Mahoney received the bad a
weeK ago, but could not accept it before
he received ..permission from the Police
Commissioners.' That was given, last
night, "and "Handsome Tom" is now
wearing his new badge of oilice.
Captain Dunleavy also received a
present. "The boys" got together- and
had an enlargement of the photograph of
Chief Crowley and the Police Commis
sioners made. It is "a picture" in every
sense of the word and no one was more
surprised than Captain Dunleavy when be
saw it. When be left at noon for his
lunch the space behind his desk was
vacant and on his return half an hour
later there ' hung the picture, with the
words "Captain Dunleavy, a happy New
Year," on a slip of paper in the corner.
There was nothing "the boys" could have
given the captain that would have pleased
him better than the pictures of bis Chief
and the Commissioners, every one of
whom is his personal friend. â '."
There was a general mix-up among the
Custom-house officers on the front yester
day. Inspector McKenna was sent to Fol

well taken care of. The staterooms are
all that could be desired, and not a thing
is lacking in the equipment of the vessel.
The Zealandia can make her fourteen

is that she wiil beat the Monowat's time

The preliminary examination of Benja

Attorney D. B. Woodworth, was contin
ued before Judge Campbell yesterday
afternoon. "_.-'.':
Hudelson's cross-examination by Wood
worth, which has occupied four after
noons, was concluded yesterday, and tbe
Judge heaved a. sigh of relief. Wood
worth confined himself almost entirely to
asking the defendant whether certain
statements had been made before the
Judiciary Board of the American Protec
tive Association during the hearing of the
charges against Rev. Donald M. Ross,
most of which was objected to as irrele
vant and immaterial, and the objections
were sustained. 'â â¢
" The Judge objected to Woodworth
dragging in the names of reputable citi
zens because certain persons were reported
as having made statements which no sen
sible man would believe they would make,
but by asking the question Woodworth
succeeded in his object.
Several times Hudelson had to ask the
protection of the court from insulting re
marks made by Woodworth till; finally

dissolve tbe tempora injunction ob
tained by Supervisor Wagner, represent
ing the Twelfth Ward, said injunction
restraining Mr. Rivers from attempting to
take possession of bis office until further
order of '.he court.
In the outset Judge Hebbard announced
that he would decline to hear any argu
ment touching the validity of the recent
election, as he holds a commission under
that election and would consider himself
disqualified for sitting for the pnrpc.se of
deciding as to the legality of the election.
He was willing to hear argument on the
technical point as to whether an injunc
tion would lie in such a case as the one at
bar, and by consent further proceedings
were continued until to-morrow morning
at 9:30 o'clock.
. An effort will in the meantime be made
to get the case before some Judge of the
Superior Court who. is legally qualified to
take ud the matter in all its bearings, in
order that a decision may be reached upon
the merits of the case at the earliest pos
sible moment.

they are about oefori) they begin the prac
tical Dart of it."*" At any rate, as lsaid, if
the work is undertaken it should be with
a view of doing it properly.
"By the way, continued Mr. Dunn, "a
Burns monument was*, agitated some years
ago by " the St. Andrew's Society and a
number. of subscriptions were secured. I
remember that I donated something. The
plan. was never carried out, and so I sup
pos i they have the money then collected.
It ought to form a nucleus for a new fund.
Ye-, I am in favor of (a Burns monument
that will be a credit to Scotchmen and the
descendants of Scotchmen in this Ciiy." *
To Dr.Miuton, professor in the theo
logical college at San An mo, is due the
credit for reviving the Burns, monument
idea at i this time. : Dr. '< Minton .visited
Scotland last August, representing l the
Scotch societies here at the Lord Kelvin
jubilee: At the banquet given jin '.: Maple
Hall -at the Palace - Hotel on : last- St.
Andrew's night, November 30, Dr. Minton
responded to a toast-to Scotland in the
course of which he mentioned the name
of Scott. He was: interrupted ;by ; pro
longed applause..^'
A little further along he spoke of Burns.
The * burst of ".; applause ' was ?;" such Vas -to
make [a'J distinct ; impression upon a him.
Afterward he spoke of it and said that the
sentiment ''. was ' evidently *so U quick % and
warm in the Scottish heart for Burns that
it \ should ; find some T substantial: expres
sion an J that :. the old; monument idea
should 'be < revived ;. and _, placed : in: such
hands as would enlist confidence, and it
would go through to a finish; in short

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE. :
The Record Shows > a Big Majority in
Favor of New Families. "
The records ot the County Clerk's office
show that- there are still a great many
more marriages than, divorces in,. San
Francisco, the marriage licenses issu?d
during the year 1896 numbering 3136,
while there were only 783 divorce suits
filed in the same period.. ' .' ".".'.'
â¢ It Is noted that June is the banner
month for marriages, while October , is a
close second. â¢ . '
â¢ The recoid, according to the months, is
as follows: January, 239; February, 280;
March, 216;' April, 261; May, 186: June,
313; July, 252; August, 257; .September,
257; October, 311; November, 287; De

In the matter of divorces, it is interest
inn to note that persons whose names'
begin with S, M, C, B and H have shown
great proneness to divorce litigation. The
list, according to initial, .is as follows:
Those whose names be_>in with A number
28 in the record of divorces, while B has
7,*) representatives, the remainder of the

As an aftermath of the Choynski-McAullffe
contest comes a suit tor $100 against '-Young
Mitchell,^manager of the new Occidental
Club, by J. C. O'Donnell, representing the
"Mission giant. " It seems that the tiling of a
suit against Mitchell was a mistake, as lie has
withheld ' the money on account of garnish
ment served on him by the Sheriff. When
that is removed he asserts his willingness to
turn the amount over to O'Donnell.

MYSTERY OF A
STOLEN PURSE
It Contained Two Hundred
. Dollars and Several
Valuable Papers. '
Mrs.' Frankopan, a Visitor to
. the City, the Victim of
a Thief.
She Lost the Key of Her Trunk, and
When She Got It Opined the
Purse Had Disappeared.
, Detectives are busily engaged endeavor
ing to elucidate the mystery of a robbery
that occurred at 1711 California street
Wednesday morning.
Tbe house is occupied by Mrs. T. H.
-Jndd.and Mrs. Frankopan, a friend, is at
present on a visit to her during the holi
day season. a . .' ' . - ;
Wednesday morning after breakfast
Mrs. Frankopan discovered that she bad
lost the key to her trunk. She searched
everywhere for it,"but could not find it,
and after lunch she went to a locksmith
to get him to open the trunk.
The locksmith went back with her and
they went to her room. t After trying sev
eral keys, one was found to fit the lock
and the trunk was opened. Mrs. Franko
pan saw at once that some one had been
tampering with the contents of 'the trunk
since sbe last looked into it in the morn
ing before losing the key. ,
N 'She * reached for the place where she
kept her 'purse to get money to pay the
locksmith, and found to her surprise that
it had been stolen. Bhe searched through
the trunk, thinking the purse might have
been by mistake put in another place, but
it was not to be found.
The- purse contained a number of valu
able papers and about $200 in coin. Mrs.
Frankopan is more vexed over the loss of
the papers than the money, and as they
are of use to no one but herself she is very
anxious, to get them back.
. Information of the robbery was at once
sent tO police headquarters and two detec
tives were sent to tue house. They ques
tioned the servant girl and every one in
the house, but were unable to get a clew.
The purse must have been stolen be
tween 10 o'clock in the morning and 1 in
the afternoon by some one who found the
lost key. At least that is the conclusion
the -detectives arrived at, but who the
thief is remains a mystery so far, although
the "sleuths" look wise and give tne
impression that they will soon 'have a
clew. â¢ . Â°.
"1 have no idea who stole the purse,"
said Mrs. Frankopan last night. "I have
no suspicion of any one, and if I had it'
would not do for me to say so unless I
had some good reason for doing so.
â¢ "It is possible tnat a sneak thief may
have entered the house by tbe rear door
and opened the trunk with a false key,
but it seems iroorobable. The frontdoor
is always kept locked, so that no one
could enter by that way.
**I think the trunk was opened and the
purse stolen during the short time I was
away for tho locksmith. It is an unfor
tunate affair and I hope the police will be
able to clear it up."

LIGHTING UP THE
CITY ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
How the Fiesta People of Polk Street Speeded
Away the Departing Year of
"Ninety-Six."
The Merry King, Surrounded
by His Royal Court, Was
in the Parade.
FATHER TIME IN BURLESQUE.
Fourth and Sixteenth Streets Have
Wheeled Into the Line of Light
â¢_ ;..;\. and Progress.
Polk street "rang out the old, rang in
the new" last nigi-t in a merry carnival in
celebration of .electric lights and coming
prosperity. It was a riot of flaming lights,
flaring red fires and bursting bombs. The
thoroughfare from Sutter to Pacific was a
brilliant avenue between two lines of
The Characters, the Throng arid the Fireworks That Closed the Polk- Street Fiesta Last Night.
colored lanterns and decorated windows.
On the last day of the fiesta every bright
bit of bunting tinted in the yellow and red
was brought out and flung to the breeze.
Then was Polk street in her glory.
All day yesterday the sidewalks were
crowded, and last evening there was a
perfect J9m. The cable-cars only with
difficulty could make their way along.
Several squads of merrymakers gro
tesquely arrayed moved here and there
around the street, stopping at different
localities to give an impromptu entertain
ment. Funny visaged fellows" appeared
on the roofs and at upper windows and
highly amused the passers-by with their
clownery.
An old man appeared marching with a
stately tread down the street, and this
venerable personage seemed to be the real
king of the carnival. If this was not his
role he was either a Father Time, a Cupid
or a Mercury. His tall hat was ornament
ed with several large feathers, as were also
the lower part of his trousers legs, which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 1 p 1 89 T.;
made the likeness to the quicksilver god
quite complete. However, on his shoul
ders were : as.tened a big pair :of turkey
wings that fluttered in his movements
quite birdlike. ,i^P_B____S_______P* **
The graceful pinions savored of Cupid,
but the old chap's gray whiskers mad*) the
Father Time manifestly apparent.
At 8 o'clock the scream of a bugle an
nounced the coming of an important per
sonage, and the King of the Fiesta rode
into the street, His majesty's charger was
inclined to jump the contract of uphold
ing a monarchial instiution and scuiry
back to the stable, but was persuaded to
remain with the circus by a tight xein.
The sovereign looked every inch a king,
according to the pictures of those individ
uals, and fitted into his place in the carni
val right royally. He was attended by a
troop of mounted courtiers and guards in
mass and followed by a military band of
music.
Then came carriages containing the offi
cers of the fiesta and the players of the
court. , There was also long line of dec
orated vehicles representing, the business
firms of Polk street.
During the parade rockets, bombs and
Roman candles were let off, filling the air
with brilliant flashes of * colored light.
Every other person was armed with a fish
horn, and the noise they made was deaf-
ening.
When the clocks told the end of the old
year preparations for firing the pyrotec
nic pieces were made, and all stood ready
to witness the display.
-At the stroke of midnight the entire
street was a blaze of glory and the mani
pulators of the fireworks began to make
preparations to fill the sky with creations
glorious to behold, among them many em
blems of purely local significance, yet
many emblematical of the passing of the
old year.
Tue pieces displayed in the variation of
powder-colors were three striking pictures.
.First, that of "Old Father Time, 1896." As
it burned away a vigorous, young Cupid
marked * '1897". came bounding into' view,
after which there came like a benediction
the old, old greeting generous, yet ever
new, "A happy New Year to you!" :.
There were many incidental pieces of
note among the fireworks, one of which
read in flaring letters, "Patronize* Polk
Street." irfll'Hll' l hh â¢W!t\ifrn l r w VR!B Bm
The fifteen or twenty dancers and street
performers attracted considerable atten
tion and applause. They were distributed
along various parts of the.line of march at'
proper distances, so as to amuse specta
tors and break the monotony of the cele
bration. *-'." ,",".'â¢'
Marshal Heintz, the king, and hi** cour
tiers and the many carriages conveying
the fiesta committee made an imposing
appearance. â  ... \
Among the noted guesj^were the mem
bers of the L.irk n-street Improvement
Club, chaperoned by President Kohn and
Secretary Dross. .
. The business wagons extended for many
blocks, the line of march at night being
substantially the same as that of the
afternoon. The procession moved from
Van Ness avenue to Eddy street, thence
down Eddy to Larkin, Sutter, Polk and
Jackson, with a countermarch to Sutter. ,
It was the general impression of all that
the lighting and improv'd methods of
business will attract general attention and
stimulate local pride in business, so that
merchants wili begin business in 1897 with
renewed hopes of substantial prosperity.
GLORIOUS SIXTEENTH.
The Thoroughfare a Blaze of Light
and Splendor.
Sixteenth street, from Valencia to Fol
som, was as much another part of the
City last night as an avenue from Chicago
or a bit of Central Park.
The fiesta of the* Sixteenth-street Im
provement Club, beginning shortly after
nightfall, impressed upon all the fact that
they have a section where brains, energy,
push and business, acumen thrive amid
'solid home comfort in the "warm belt of
the Mission." There are no less than six
lines of caw that tap this locality, carry
ing a population of over twenty thousand
people' rough the arteries of commerce
â¢.arid traffic- â  â :â¢â *

line of Sixteenth street bung their places

anese ianterns and evergreens. They did
it with such earnestness' that Sixteenth
street last night looked like an arched
passage-way of wide dimensions, bril
liantly illuminated with' electricity and
bonfires at every corner. â¢
Yon der Mehden's band 'of twenty
pieces headed the parade of merchants,
discoursing music along the line of march,
while the hired men in charge of the py
rotechnics sought spots in the multi-col
ored canopy to send up shells and rockets,'
that the outside world might, know .that
it was "a night in Sixteenth street." .

NINTH-STREET PROGRESS.
Now the Solid Business Men There
Want Good Pavements.*
I The progressive business men who : were
in the.v an of street lighting by electricity
and illuminated Ninth street from Market
to Mission are one and all satisfied with
their work. 0 Such an improvement as they
have accomplished did not fail to have its
effect, for already Nintl**r Street is crowded
at night. And -it has encouraged the
merchants on that thoroughfare to make

difference is that between day and night;
There are six arc lights in each block, and
no other street has done better. But that

"Immediately after the holidays there
will be a meeting of the merchants in the

as far as . Howard, if ; not to Folsom, to
come together on a proposition of taking
up the present pavement and laying bitu
men. Ninth street is level and â _ could
easily be made a part of 'the Folsom-street
boulevard, in which case teams and vehi

going to or from the Mission. This would
bring mote business to* us all along the

not have a street equal to any in point of

It lacks what is technically called "stop
ping power." The bullet" devised by the
Bridgeport man has a cavity near the
point which causes it to "mushroom" â "
i. c., spread â on striking so as "to pro
duce a large an : lacerated wound, accom
panied by great shock." In time ot peace
it may be employed for killing lions, tigers
and elephants.
The very newest thingin this line, how
ever, is tbe aluminum bullet. Of course,
it is very light, aluminum being only
about as heavy as chalk. It is not intended
for use in war, but for hunting and shoot
ing at targets. Ordinary bullets have an
excess of force for such purposes,,
taveling unnecessarily far. Those of
aluminum, on the other hand, have about
tho same force for short distances, but
their velocity diminishes rapidly beyond
303 yards. *_L____Â£t >*.'-..-_<..-;-.â¢.â¢_â¢â  <.-,â.-'

ing may avail himself of the novel idea of
another inventor, who suggests' that tin
plate shot would be preierable to the kind
now in Use. These latter 'are coated with
graphite to blacken and polish them, and
this is alleged to be objectionable because
the graphite fouls tbo gun. Furthermore,
the load is acted upon .chemically by the
animal juices, so aB to be injurious to tbe
eater .of the flesh. This is obviated by the .
coating of tin. :"JEÂ«SK?-Â£3-S
There is a popular notion, by the. way,
to the effect that lead shot are made
spherical by falling from- a height. This
is an absurd error, inasmuch as the only
purpose of lofty shot towers is to give the
shot a chance to cool and harden as they.
tumble. They are just as perfect spheres
, When they start from 'the top as when
they reach the well of water 200 feet or so
.below. The Â° usefulness of the water is .
merely as a soft cushion to 'receive them.
Shot cannot be made from pure lead,
but an admixture of arsenic causes the lead
to form globules, like mercury. The molt
en mixture is placed in a big iron sauce
pan with a perforated bottom, and the
drops falling through are the shot They
must fall some d: stance in order to get

plumbago, and finally put through a se

OTTINGER'S RACING DEAL.
The Supreme Court Considers Facts in
an Agreement With Hankins
â Et Al. , :
The Supreme Court yesterday decided
a case in which. legal light was thrown
upon the subject of Letting on horse
races. Hankins and others were partners
with Ottinger and others in a deal by
which all premiums and \ stake moneys to
be received from the Pacific Coast blood
horse association and the California
Jockey Club, which should be won by their
hoises, should be evenly divided, half and
halt One of Ottinger's. horses won $5480
and Ottinger refused to divide. Hankins
and the others cot judgment and Ottinger
appealed the case to the Supreme Court. â
The Supreme Court considered what
legality there is in betting on â¢ horse races
in California and defined the distinction
between money due on bets end money
received - for premiums. "At common
law," said the court, "a' wager made in
respect to matters not affecting, the feel
ings, interest or character of a third per
son, or the public peace, or good morals,
or public policy, was -'valid and Its pay
ment could be enforced." But where the
conditions were the opposite no action
could "be maintained. Whether . betting
on horse races was of a character to fall
within the latter class at common law is a
matter about which there is elsewhere
some contrariety, but ;in .California that
question bas been settled. '-. â â¢.".
The court found that" in the. case of .
.Gridley against Djr-n it was held that.'
such 'contracts are void as contravening
good morals and cannot be enforced by
the courts. "It is well settled .that a bet
or wager, such as comes within the rule
of public policy and good morals .invoke 1 1
in that case and by the appellants here,
is where the parties competing themselves
each put up or bet a certain sum or valu
able thing, . which 'is'to -_ be taken .by the'
winner and forfeited *by the loser on the
turn of an event. Such a contract will
not be. affirmed by the courts, but the par
ties will be left for. redress to their own
code of ethics." v; .
The contract in this suit was not such a
contract, i "It related solely to purses or
stake moneys to be paid by the associa
tions offering them and covered nothing
Which the parties themselves might see
fit to hazard. ; There was no wager or bet
of their own money. Bating ;is regarded
as immoral.* â ' Offering } of â  a purse i encour
ages the breeding of an animal for speed
and competing for sued offerings is not a

forgery, was called ; in : Judge Conlan's
court yesterday' 1 and continued till Mon
day. â  ..-.- ; * . . "â ;â¢-; .
Dewey was arrested; about three weeks
ago by - Detective tv Harry Rey nolds. He
and a man named .Harris, who escaped
from Los "Angeles, ';?â¢'* are accused of
swindling a large number of merchants
by means of a fake directory. They got
the merchants to sign a contract for an
advertisement at a nominal charge, and
when the contract was presented for > pay
ment the amount had been raised all the
way from $10 to $50. .'ln. many instances',
rather than, have trouble, the merchants
paid the amount.
Captain Lees yesterday received a letter
from New York inclosing an article from
the New York Herald exposing a similar
swindle there amounting, to over $80,000.

CHARLES KOHLER'S
CREDITOR LUCKY
They Will Be Paid in Full
for All Their . Â°
Claims. Â° "
Judge Coffey Decides That the
.Testators- Mother Must Â°
â  ; .â¢ Wait. ' â¢â  .
She Was Her Son's Partner, and His
_: Individual Bills Must Be
Settled First. Â° Â°
Creditors of the estate of the late Charles
Kobler and others similarly situated will
be interested in a decision handed down
by Judge Coffey yesterday in which Mrs.
Elise Kohler, a surviving member of the
firm of Kohler ___ Frohling an 1 mother of
the decedent, sought to have tier claim
against the Charles Kobler estate prorated
with the claims of other creditors. .;"
George H. Blucher is an individual
creditor of the decedent testator, Charles
Kohler, who was a member of the firm of
Kohler & Frohling, a partnership very
largely indebted to many persons. , The
affairs of the partnership are not yet set
tled. -i .-â¢'...'â¢'
â '. In case the assets of the firm shall prove
insufficient to discharge the partnership
debts,' Judge Coffey says,' then the estate
of the testator wili be liable. v
The account of the executor, says the
court, shows that he has sufficient cash on
hand to satisfy ail the separate creditors,
with a surplus. Butcher asks,, therefore,
that the executor be directed to pay his
claim in full as a separate creditor. =
Other claims . have been presented,
among them that of Mrs. El ise Kohler for
a large sum. Mrs. Kohler's claims have
been allowed and approved by the pro
bate court as contingent claims against
the estate in question, and it is contended
that in tbe circumstances of the case and
under the articles of _ copartnership of
Kobler & Fronting, of which she was a
member, Mrs. Kohler is entitled to rank
as a separate creditor, and as, if that be
so, the assets of the estate at present will
be insufficient to pay all the creditors of
that class Mrs. Kohler's attorn, ys suggest
that the utmost the court may now uo is
to make, a pro rata payment. " 0 '-..
The claim of Mrs. Konler arise from her
paying the- one-third of the losses of the
him of Kohler & Frohling that would
have been paid by, Charles Kohler if he
had lived and had been financially open to
respond to those demands. Mrs. Kohler is
held for losses and must make them good
out of her personal estate, â¢ for -which
reason she contends tbat she has a right
to stand as an individual creditor on an
equal footing with other creditors.
A clause in the copartnership agreement
reads: "It is furtei* agreed that said Elise
Kohler,. Charles Kohler and Hans H. Koh
ler shall each bear alike- one-third of all
the Josses, if any, of said business."
The point before the court.was to deter
mine whether Mrs. Kobler's claims are to
be classed as _ partnership claims or as
separate claims. â¢: ' .
The estate had on hand $15,959 96, and
the personal claims, excluding" tho^e of
Mrs. Â»Kohler, amount to but $11,740 89.
The claims of Mrs. Kohler foot up $106,996,
and she objected to paying the claims of
others unless she should be ; allowed her
pro portion, of the funds in. the hands of
the executor. â¢
Blucher objected to this on the ground
that, Mrs. Kobler must rely 'on the assets
of the estate of the deceased after his in
dividual debts are liquidated. In support
ing this view Judge' Coffey said that , the
question -was' reolved finally into this
form: "Whether the claims of Mrs. Elisse
.Kohler, as the surviving partner of Kohler
& Frohling, were entitled to preference as
against the estate of Charles Kohler, de
ceased, over the liabilities created* by him
individually in his lifetime, as was; the
claim of B.ucher. -I thinK uot"
. The order that Blucher be paid was
made, and all of Kohler's individual cred
itors will now receive payment in full in

Judge McKenna Has .Refused to Issue
."an Injunction In the Aerial 3
â¢: Ballet Case. .'â 'â 
United States Circuit Judge McKenna
has denied the application of Carl E. Nils
son for an injunction -to prohibt the
Palmer Cox brownies company and Al
Hay man Company from producing, the
aerial ballet at their performance at the
Baldwin Theater." : Nilsson has a patent
for the machinery and appliances by
which dancers are made to appear to per
form in midair, and he claimed tnat the
apparatus used by the Brownies company
is an infringement upon his patent. He
not only asked for damages but an injunc
tion restraining the Baldwin Theater peo
ple from further, use of the machinery in
question. =
Judge McKenna, in denying the Injunc
tion, stated .that the patent being of very
recent date is virtually a "green patent"
and the public has not yet had time to
recognize < ituer the patent or the rights
confirmed by the ; letters patent. More
over, the patent has never been in litiga
tion to determine its validity. In his re
marks Judge McKenna said that the affi
davits of the defendants were not at all
satisfactory, as tney failed to meet or an
swer the allegations set out by the com
plainant. In fact the affidavits presented
by the latter as weil were vague. '_ He
added that Nelsson had many opportuni
ties to contest this case in the East, but
he neglected to do so. and it is not really
fair to the. defendants to enjoin them
from using the usual ballet apparatus as
they would be and have been deprived of
the privilege of presenting 'certain evi
dence which they could secure in the East.
A SEALER CONDEMNED.
The Schooner Jane Gray Forfeited for
Illegally Killing Fur Seats. Â°
United Stales District Judge Morrow has
rendered an opinion in the sealing case of
the United States against the American
schooner Jane Gray, her cargo and C. F.
Nonhemann; the owner of the schooner.
The action was to condemn the vessel,
with all tackle, boats, furniture, pro
visions and cargo, ; consisting of 257* fur
seal skins, .for violating the act of Con
gress of April 24, 1894, which prohibits
the pursuing and killing of seals in the
waters surrounding the Pribilov islands,
within a zone of sixty miles of the islands.
In the libel 'there 9 were two .counts, one
that the sealers killed, twenty-one seals
within the prohibited area, and the other
lor pursuing seals. The schooner was
seized by the United States revenue cutter
Corwin, then stationed- In Bering Sea for
the purpose of protecting the seais.
Judge Morrow is of the opinion that
the day mentioned in the libel the Jane f
Gray was not pursuing seals, as the weather
waÂ« too rough. Â° __';. -.>â¢'.'.*_
Upon the second count" the Judge says
that the testimony ot the officers of the
Corwin is positive that the Jane Gray was
within the prohibited area on the evening
of August 22, 18S6. The cut picked up
two of the schooner's boats, and in one
the body of a dead seal was found. When
the Officer of the Corwin boarded the
Jane Gray He saw several dead seals on
deck. After summing up all of the evi
dence and testimony, wnich shows that
the schooner and her boats were within
the prohibited area engaged in the un
lawful _ business of killing fur seals, the
Judge says, "Let a judgment and decree
of condemnation and forfeiture be entered
in favor of the United States." . ;; 'yt. _
The schooner was valued at $2765 and
the cargo at $2179 50. While the judg
ment is ofor0 for the condemnation the decree
will go against the bondsmen, who will be
obliged to .make good to Â° the Government
the aggregate of the amounts staled....

BELIEVED THAT HE
WAS DIVORCED
Curious Defense of Charles
D. Dinckley, a Big
amist. o
He Has a Worthless Certificate,
c Which He Got Over Three
o Years Ago.
It Was Signed "Judge J. H. Prout,"
and Was Given Him by, an At
torney He Had Employed.
Charles D. Dinckley, who was arrested
Tuesday night on a charge of bigamy, will
have a curious defense to offer when the
case: comes on for Hearing before Judge
Joachimsen. . . ,
Yesterday his attorney, Walter Gal
lagher, had a talk witb- Chief Crowley.
He told the Chief that Dinckley bad a
certificate of divorce from his first wife in
bis trunk, and he asked that an officer
should be detailed to accompany Dinckley
to his Home, so that the certificate could
be obtained. ; Â°
This, was done, but it was discovered
that the certificate was _ a worthless docu
ment. It purported to be a certificate of
divorce granted â¢by Judge "J. ri. Prou."
on August 19, 1893, in the case of Charles
D. Dinckley against Alice M. Dinckley,
and was countersigned by- "John Row
lins. Deputy County Clerk." To make it
appear more regular a notarial certificate
signed by Notary Public Wheat was at
tached, which had been originally attached
to some other document. _
Dinckley said he paid a man who repre
sented Himself as an attorney $50 to pro
cure the divorce for nim, and he' believed
the certificate was genuine. He had for
gotten the name of the attorney. His at
torney will. now contend that Dinckley
cannot be convicted of bigamy, as he hon
estly believed he had been divorced from
hi- first, wife, and the certificate will be
offered as evidence o^that fact.
Dmckley was married to his first wife
in New York twenty-one years ago. He
was at one time a merchant, but has for
some years been employed in the con
struction-department of the Market-street
Railway Company. He is now over 60
years of age, but is hale and hearty.
On November 26 he was married to
Augusta Gabrieison by the Rev. Dr. Dille, â¢
and they were living together up to the
time Dincklew was arrested..
The friends of the first Mrs. Dinckley
allege that Dinckley's sole reason for get
ting rid of her was because she has been
for some time a sick woman and be de
sired to be relieved of the obligation of .
supporting her. ' The complaining witness
in the case is Mrs. Carrie Hall, 780 Mi-sion
street,* a friend of the first Mrs. Dinckley.

The annual circular of I.' Steuart gives the re
ceipts of coal at this port in 1896 at .1,296,900
tons, against 1,415,200 tons in 1895. Last year's
receipts were "as 'follows: -Australian, 241,600
tons: Great Britain. 145.900: British- Columbia,
437,100; Eastern, 17,700: Seattle. 134,200;
TacOma, 263,900; Coos Bay, 49,100; other mines,
4500. â  â â ' . ' "
The circular says: ."In my annual report of
' last year I stated that the people of tne State had
reaped the benefit of cheaper fuel than ever before
known In the history of. California. The year just
ended, however, "outstrips Â»li previous records In
respect to prices of Australian coal, low grade
steam coals from Australia having been fold here
in considerable quantities by the cargo 'as low as
$3 75 per ton, while prices of English anthracite
coal have ruled higher than last year; the highest
price of Australian coal during' the" year being
H5 25 per ton. -and IkM highest price of English
. anthracite coal $6 75 ton:, the average reduc
tion in crice-of Australian coals this year, as
against ttie previous ear's prices, being $- 60 per
ton, and the average increase on price of English
anthracite coal being $105 per ton during. same
periods. ."â "' - â¢
â  "It-is gratifying to note that the consumption of
coal throughout the State for the year now ended
has been mlly up to tne average, notwithstanding
the fact tha oil. water power, electricity and
natural gas nave been utilized Co a arge extent tor
power . and other manufactu ting purposes, super
seding the use of coal in such instances, which
certainly is satisfactory evidence of the pro
gressive and growing requirements of the State.
â "With all these aids to prosperity _ the State
lar-ks one most essential element necessary to
promote its more rapid growth and general devel
opment, ami that is cheap Internal transportation.
Wuen this has been achieved then an eia of true

40.0C0 tons, together 152,600 tons, making- the
to-.al imports here and in the south 1.449,500
tons." 9 â¢
The circular pf J. W. Harrison says: 'Our con-'
sumption of coal this year is over 10 per eeut less
than in 1895, which is an assurance that the out
going year has not been -a profitable ope for our

DUN'S REVIEW OE - TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 31.â R. G. Dun <- Co.
in th*Â»ir weekly review of trade Saturday, Janu
ary, 2, will say : There have j been more commer
cial ; failures in 1896 than In any previous year
except 1893, about 14,890 against 13,197 last year,
an increase in number of about 12 per cent and ln
liabilities of 29 per cent.
The year closes with an epidemic of failures,
mainly at the West and in banks, loan and trust
companies, or concerns dependent on them. The
action of clearing-houses in various places mdi- !
cates 'no want of confidence and several banks
which have failed will be enabled to pay in full,
but disclosur-s of unsoundness in a few widely
known institutions in the abnormal state of popu
lar tee;ln_ after an extended contest on monetary
Issues mis caused distrust and suspicion where it
is frequently undeserved.
There has been no monetary pressure' to cause
trouble, nor have importations of products de
clined in value. There has evidently been ' too
liberal assistance given by some fiduciary con
cerns to speculative operations. No drain on
Eastern f tiuds has resulted since the first alarm
at the large failures. Failures often grow more
frequent as annual settlements approach. 0
The year 1896 has been one of singular and con
fusing fluctuations in process, of which very lull
detai.s are given. Wheat rose to 81c February 8,
fell t060%c June 29, and rose to 92c December 9.
Cotton started at 8.31 c, with stories of scanty sup
pi fell so 7 62c March 6, rose, to 8.37 May 7:
dropped to 7.05 c July 16, when a heavy surplus
was pressing; rose to 8.87 c September 10; with
stories . that the new crop was ruined fell to 7, but
closed at 7:12- f ..'-â â¢? â¢
Wool rose at an average of $14 70 for all domes
tic grades February 1. fell to $12 16 -eptemberl,
rose to $13 66 ; December 1, and has since de
emed. Iron Â»nd its products rose 3 per cent to
April 1 and then declined every month to Decem
ber 1, In all about 20 per cent. since rising slightly.
Boots aud shoes tell 13 per cent in the spring,
against leather 18 and bide <21 per cant. Then
shoes rose gradually 20 per cent to December and
leather 17 percent, but has since' fallen '3 percent, ;
while bides ruse 25 per cent to July 3, dropped 22
percent to July 8, rose 50 per cent to Novem
ber 4, and have since declined 13 per cent.
cotton goods were at be highest point January
1. fell 17 per cent to' August 6. rose 7 per cent to
November and have since declined about 2 per
ceuv \" . " ' ' â  i .
The Incongruity of these changes shows what ob
stacles business has bad to face. In none of the
Industries mentioned bas there been activity the
past week. 'Holiday dullness has oetrn intensified j
by the failures ana the efforts of great combina- .
tions to make new arrangements. 'With iron, coke, ;
wool, co ton and bides a.l somewhat lower, there
is almost universal 'confidence that | business will â 
soon become large and safer tban for a long time.
The cotton-mills have enormous stocks of unsoid
goods in seme lines, the surplus of priu: cloths be
ing the larges. ever known and' about a quarter of
a year's cousump;lou." .
Wool sales dropped 24 percent in the first four
month and were (-mailer than tor five years: de
creased 56 per teat* in the .second four., mouths,
when new wool was coming forward, and were ,
'much th- smallest ever, known, except in the
panic of i 873, but. enormous sa cs, mainly specu
lative, made the trade during the 1..5. four months
equal to that of last year. The volume of busi
ness during 0 i 896 has varied remarkably. Pay
ments through tbe ciearing-bouses I were slightly
lower iv each of, the first four mouths than in
1895. but 20 per cent' smaller than In 1892. In -
the six months. May and October Inclusive, pay
ments weie every month smaller, than last year,
- 16 ncr cent in September, and in that month and
October about 24 per cent snuii>er than in 1892.
â¢In .November a small Improvement over 1.-96
appeared and the decrease from 1892 was but 12
cent, but in December payments Vvere 9.8 per
cent smaller than last year, and 2.08 per cent
smaller than in 1896. - " . " Â°
Railroad earnings were slightly larger than 'ait
year In etch of the first seven months and smaller
each month than in 1892. In Aug-mst and the lat
ter months theie has been iv decrease as great as
12 per cent In November from 1895 and. 6.2 per
cent In August from 1892.
. Wheat has rlaeii to ihe highest point since June,
1892, because Western receipts iff five weeks have
been but 13,280,000 busheis,agai___st _!_>, 606,357 last
mar., Atlantic exports, flour included, have been
In five weeks 9,900.000 bushels and 10.413,249
last year." The exports from New* ork Decem
ber were 6 per cent larger and imports 12 per cent
smaller than last year.- Â°;. v ; ' ââ¢ ''â ';':

OAKLAND, Cal , Dec. 31.â The military
ball of Company F was held at the armory
to-night. Very elaborate decorations were
prepared, and a very influential gathering
was present. Company F is the most
historic organization in Oakland. It was
founded in 1877 by Colonel William T.
Little for the purpose of suppressing any
"July riots" in Oakland, such as occurred
in that year in San Francisco. Nine
hundred and fifty-two of the most repre
sentative citizens formed the early organ
ization, which was known as the Oakland
Light Cavalry. It was later changed' to
an infantry compiny and taken in by the
National Guard. Their annual ball is
always a social event, and that of to-night
was equal to any that have preceded it.

Assembly-man Oscar F. Breiling is de
termined, it possible, to ameliorate the
condition of the residents of bis district
so far as the West Oakland marsh is con
cerned.
Since h\a election he has been working
hard io formulate a bill that would give to
the municipality power to condemn the
marsh as a nuisance.
Last evening Mr. Breilin?, in conjunc
tion with Judge Frick, carefully went
over the proposed measure, and the Judce
pointed out some sections which appear
Oscar Breiling.
to conflict with existing laws. There are
certain statutes as they stand at present
which might; be construed us making it
possible for the city to do what was
sought to be done under the proposed
.measure. But the nui-ance has existed
so long that-it was thought that no exist
ine law could reach it. : Â°
"I l_*ve promised the people," said Mr.
. Breiling, "that I would do all I could to
afford them relief from the West Oakland
marsh and I have worked night and' day
to Keep my promise. My idea is to have
the municipality given power to condemn
special nuisances, with the hope of having
it in an especial manner, refer to the
marsh at West Oakland. .. â¢
"Although Judge Frick has pointed out
to me sections in the laws which make it
possible to do what I sought to do with
my bill I have not given up the idea of

BUTTE BACKS OUT.
Will Not Meet the Reliance Team on
the Gridiron.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 31.â There will
be no football contest between the Re
liance and Butte teams. To-day. Captain
McMillan of Butte refused to match his
men against the local club. -
"It is a clean backdown, prompted by
cowardice," said Fred Frick, captain of
the Reliance team. "McMillan knew we
could beat tbem and therefore he refuses
to play. He did not dare to come out at
first and refuse to play us, but kept pot
ting matters off. At last he said he would
play if Benson's employers would extend
his leave of absence. We telegraphed to
Butte and an extension was given Benson.
It was then agreed tbat the game should
take place on tbe 9th, but later McMillan
hemmed and hawed so we agreed to play
next Tuesday, to which McMillan con
sented, but this morning sent word that
he would not play us at all. He tried to
dodge the game all the time, but 'J we
consented to everything and forced him to
play or absolutely back down." '-r-iyyy

NO REGARD PAID
TO INSTRUCTIONS
Alameda Politicians Set the
-. Precedent of Acting In'
* dependently.
All Manner of So-Called Pledges
* and Principles Are
Ignored.
Several Legislative Candidates Elected
in Opposition, to the Plat- ':.
â â :'"' form. 'â "â¢-'â¢: _
' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,} â¢
908 Broadway, Dec. 31. J
There is a general feeling of political
emancipation "in Alameda County. The
dictates of different sections of the same
parties have come to be regarded as carry
ing no weight or imposing, no obligation
on the parties whom they would .bind.
. This feeling bad its birth four months
ago when the great, fight occurred over
the manner in which delegates to the
State Republican convention should 1 be
chosen either by "appointment of the
various State committeemen or by elec
tion at primaries. At that time the Hil
born-Frick Congressional . primary was in
the distance, and the' Hilborn men were
anxious to prevent the laying down of any
precedent that might affect the Congres
sional primary. With this, end in view
Guy C. Earie led a strong fight- against
the other member*, of the Alameda rele
gation of the State' Central Committee.
On that occasion the National convention
ruled that the order of the State Central
Committee allowing each member to do
as he pleased in the matter of delegates
was perfectly legal, and the anti-primary
delegates were seated at St. Louis.
The action of the State Convention
definitely settled the 'matter and seated
what was known as .the Friend delegation,
and this was considered as forever settling
the questions as to whether delegates
should be elected at primaries or not, W.
H. Friend headed the primary faction and
was powerfully backed by ex-Mayor
Pardee and others'. At the Hilbotn-Frick
primary a great cry was raised against the
practices ot appointing, delegates .'to any
convention, but within a few weeks a
great change has come over the primary
advocates. - .
In three weeks' time the same men who
advocated the election of all delegates at
primaries will appoint a whole municipal
convention to nominate' a complete city
ticket. It is cone- by many mat this,
in the absence of a primary law, is per
haps the better method of the two, but
against these stands the oft-repeated
statements of the primary men at the last
Congressional campaign. This trimming
of political sails to different breezes has
resurrected the factional feeling 'that it
wa* thought had died out with Hilborn's
election, out now that .' the primary men
are potting 'in., practice the tactics that
tbey formerly condemned the breach has
been reopened. ". â¢ " "-*". .'"
It has often been supposed that the
paragraph in the platform of the Repub
lican County convention held in Alameda
last September binds the members of the
legislative delegation from this county to
vote for Senator Perkins. This is not tbe
case; for several oi the 'candidates who
appeared before their respective district
conventions made their tight on an anti-
Peikins platform, and prior to the conven
tion freely 'expressed tbeir views, basing
their opposition to Perkins on the fact of
his having violated a pledge in. the Hil
born-Frick contest.
. Apart from this some of the members of
the Alameda delegation always have been
ttrongly opposed to "convention instruc
tions and have expressed themselves as
believing that the pledge they made as
individuals when electing their primary
tickets must take precedence over any cut
or dried party programme.
A significant feature of - the feeling of
the Alameda delegation was shown a few'
weeks aeo when they met in caucus. Al
though matters of far less importance
were discussed freely the most important
matter of all, that of indorsing a candi
date for United States Senator, was not
touched upon, and this omission, which
was no doubt brought about in the inter
est of harmony, has occasioned much
comment. -â¢ -
RETURNS TO THE ATTACK
The Rev. J. Clarke Robbins" In
dulges in- More Remarks
About Dr. Payne.
The Congregationalist Becomes Sar
castic in His Reply to the
Unitarian,
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 31.â The Rev.
J. Clarke Robbins became sarcastic to-day
in his war of words, with" the Rev. E. B.
Payne. "
"I did not intend to reply to the Uni
tarian's last attack," said Mr. Robbins,
"but his mental gyrations were so funny I
felt impelled to maj-c a final answer.
"Mr. Payne labors most strenuously to
disclaim any feeling indicating the tone
of sadness and disappointment to wnich I
called attention, but in his last reply.he is
evidently a mad man. Medical science
tells us that madness is ; very frequently
preceded by melancholia, therefore my.
Impression of : the tone of sadness in his
farewell is scientifically established by the
sequence of madness. .
"In a lucid interval Mr. Payne says .'I
hope no one will think that I do not real
ize how sharp the above words are.' It is
a pity his good sense did not remain long
enough with bim after. such an admission
to cause hira to destroy the results of his
sad. mental condition. If Mr. _ Payne : is
subject to such spells of irrationalism it is
easy to see why he has to work so hard
to get a rational view of things.' â ".'Â£ ->-^-y
The Congregationalist proceeded -to
make ironical references to Mr. Payne's
"pet hobby of Altruism, '.'and gently sug
gested that the Unitarian tiy to be a liv
ing exponent of it.. â _'-. :â â â¢â â¢;'â â¢
."A mad man is not a fit object for criti

HUNTING A JAIL.
Humorous â â  Incident in the Early Crim.
".;:', fnal History, of Emeryville.
OAKLAND, ;Cal., Dec. 31.â Although
Emeryville has been an incorporated city
for three, weeks the Town Marshal made
his first arrest to-day. He, experienced
more trouble after he had caught his man
than he did in catching him. The indi
vidual was a plain, ordinary drunk.
Being so young, Emery ville. has not yet
attained the dignity of possessing a jail,
so the Town Marshal took his prisoner to
the County Jail. Here he was refused ad
mittance and the man was next taken to
the City Prison. . The - gates there were
also closed against i.im and the Marshal
left for Emeryville with his prisoner.
The prisoner, whose name is Smith, will
probably be released. He will swear that
he was not drunk and the. Marshal will
swear that he was. It is a custom where
a prisoner denies being drunk to back up
the- officer's" testimony with that of the
jailer who books the prisoner.. Mr. Smith
was riven around so long by the Town
Marshal of Emeryville that when he was
at the County Jail be was partly sober;
when he got to the City Prison 'he was
nearly sober,' and by the time he got back
to Emeryville the breezes from the. bay
bad sobered him up completely and.it
would have been a' difficult matter to
prove that he bad eVer been drunk. He
will be tried before' the local Judge to
morrow morning. ; - â¢ '

the "-.rounds' upon which he 'based bis
withdrawal do not exist.
Bacon, in a curt letter asking that his
name be. stricken from the anion's roll of

assumed to speak for the society and to
declare the opposition of its members to

BURNED ALL THE DEEDS.
Unique Ceremony by the Twenty-Third
Avenue Baptist Congregationâ
Last Hundred Dollars Paid.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 31.â An interest
ing ceremony was performed at -the
Twenty-third avenue .Baptist Church to
night. On a table on the platform in the
presence of a joyous congregation .was
formally burned the mortgace which has
hung over the church for several years.
Rev. Robert Whitaker, the pastor of
the church, is the minister who opened
the crusade . a few weeks, ago against
church fairs, and whose congregation re
cently decided . unanimously that . they
would have no more of them. â¢
When Mr. Whitaker -preached his ser
mon denouncing church fairs there was
an old Methodist <in the congregation,
whose name is preserved as a secret,'. who
was so much impressed with the pastor's
words that _ after the service he went into
the vestry and told Mr. -Whitaker that he
would give the last hundred dollars to
pay off the church mortgage.
The existing balance, was soon obtained
and with the hundred dollars the mort
gage was lifted. g Not only was the release
of the' mortgage celebrated to-night but
also the fact that the running expenses of
the church show a ; balance on the right
side. . . '.'â â -â  "â¢,."....''.'.
'.. Although all entertainments for pay are
forbidden, the congregation is making
special " efforts to make a ; feature oi the
social, side of church life. They have
inaugurated a monthly social gathering at
which members of all churches are wel
comed and which wi 1 be open affairs and
â¢all entertainment and refreshment will be
furnished gratis. Tnese 'entertainments
will be held on : the Friday evening, prior
to third Sunday of each month. _ .
Tbe ceremony to-nicht was. very simple.
After - a prayer .by : the , pastor, returning
tha nts that the church was in such an
admirable .financial i condition, ; Rev. R.
Whitaker ; made -a ; few , remarks , showing
how , such a â¢ happy.; condition had been
brought about and; how it'could be main

GAMBLING DENS

Mayor Sutro Vetoes the
Ordinance Against
Poolrooms.
The Supervisors' Will Probably
Disregard His Message
To- Morrow.
Supervisor-Elect Morton Placed in
the Seat of C. L Taylor,
Resigned
. . Mayor Sutro has put himself on record
as favoring the disreputable gambling
dens that infest the town' by vetoing the
ordinance that was passed by the Board
of Supervisors with the intention of pre
venting the youth of the town from gam
bling in the poolrooms where the odds on
various horseraces are posted.
The Board of- Supervisors, after consid
bring the matter carefully, decided that
the betting on horseraces when carried' on
within the confines, of a racetrack was
legitimate, inasmuch as it was indulged
in only by sporting men, who could afford
to spend a Cay to go. to the track and to
pay the' entrance fee demanded. . â¢
* The board put the stamp of its disap
proval on the dens where messenger-boys,
errand-boys, clerks and other employes
could- bet their earnings on the money of
their employers in sum's varying from 25
cents. to ,$1 without the interest of seeing
the race and merely with the .incentive of
gain. Mayor Sutro held his decision until
yesterday afternoon, and then, too late for
the meeting of the board, rendered a veto
message.
It is not expected that the board, after
putting it's official foot on .matter, will
allow the.Mayor to "pocket" the veto. A
meeting is to be held to-morrow and then
the veto will be considered. It is expected
'that the majority will favor the passage of
the measure despite the veto, and that it
will go to print. If this be done a meet
ing will probably be called on ___Londay
morning before the regular session and
the much needed ordinance finally ac-'
cepted. â¢ ' ' . â 
The board sustained the Mayor's veto of
the ticket-brokers' ordinance by a vote of
5 to 5, Supervisors King and Benjamin
being absent. .' '. .
The order prohibiting trespass on rail
road tracks was passed over the veto.
Supervisor Taylor's resignation was ac
cepted and Supervisor-elect Morton was
placed in the vacant chair by the unani
mous vote of the members present.

MILITIA SHOOTING RULES
Men Must Make a Certain Per

the Year.
A Peculiarity in Regard to Uniforms
Worn at the Kate Field Funeral.'
Promotions- From the Ranks. '--â 
The Legislature at its next session will
be called upon to pass on a number of
measures that" will, affect- the National
Guard of California. Brigadier-General
Dickinson, who is on the retired list, and
at 'the last election* was. chesen a State
Senator .will, ; it jis understood, be chair
man of "the Senate ' Military Committee,
and it is asserted that he has several very
sharp knives, which -ha proposes to use on
the Jaws affecting the National Guard.
. The "month of quietness in National
Guard circles will terminate on Thursday
and after the first week in \ January drills,
inspections and the routine of military
life will be resumed.
The Commissioners having charge of
the revisions of the codes have examined
the law relating to the National Guard
and have come to the conclusion that a
number of.' amendments are necessary.
Brigadier-General Warfield, commanding
the Secopd Brigade, commenting on the
amendments recommended; by the Com
missioners, said: '"There is no objection
to the amendments providing for cavalry
as well as artillery and an try as the law
now 5 stands. The ; proposition that . the
; major-general .Â» and brigadier- generals
shall in ;, addition â , to ii ot her qualifications
required .; have served at least Â« four J years
previous as officers in the National Guard
of the State is a curious one. That would
shutout experienced soldiers, retired army
officers, who by reason of service *on the
field are .qualified v lor ,' the positions, and
men % who â  have ' served .. in â _:" the National
Guard of other States. -Men of that kind
are - y ; certainly 'â " a? "v capable - â  â¢â â â  as : y men
who have Y served four years in the
National Guard of this State." .
The â  general 1 was of -' the opinion that
there was no objection to the : other pro
posed amendments, that the term of all
elective ... officers of .the line be increased
from two to four years; that thej rank of
the commanding officer of the Naval Bat
talion-.'.be increased from lieutenant-com
mander to commander; that the number
of men constituting the ambulance corps
in each regiment be increased from six to
twelve; ? that * the numberof companies
constituting a regiment be increased, from
six to eight and. not more than ; twelve;
that instead of a lieutenant-colonel there
shall he but one major as the field officer
of a V battalion and that no one shall be
eligible as field officer who has not served
at least two years in the National Guard ;
and that the m dical department be or
ganized into a sanitary 'corps with a sur
geon-general with the rank of colonel and
such number of commissioned officers and
privates as may be required. .".* .
â Colonel ; Currier also approved all the
amendments proposed, and stated, that
the one requiring individuals to have
served four years in "the National Guard
of the State to be eligible for the position
of major-general or brigadier-general was
no doubt introduced to prevent the ap
pointment of men from civil .life and to
give the men in the guard a preference in
the matter of filling high offices. Â
': None of these amendments were on the
recommendation of the board of officers.
The 1 firing regulations for . small arms
recently adopted have just been issued
from the office of the adjutant-general.
They will go into operation on the 30th of
next June. They provide that:
â¢Target practice In the National Guard shall
be 'held in January, May, S ptembe'r and Oc
tober of each year, at 200, 300 and 500 yard
ranges and skirmish firing. 'â â 
Each officer and enlisted man shall be al

nually and the same to be fired as follows: Oue
rsco of live shots at each of the 200, 300 and
500 yards each in January, September and Oc
tober; provided that each officer and enlisted
man must make a score of at least 19 at the
200-yard target before he shall be allowed - to
fire at the 300-yard target, and he must . make
a like score at the 300-yard target before be
ing permitted to fire at the 500-yard target:
also one score of ten shots at skirmish firing
in May. -
The classification in marksman: A total
annual score of at least 02 points out of -a pos
sible 75 at the 200-yard range and 45 points
at the 300-yard range. Riflemanâ A total
annual score of at least 52 points out of a pos
sible 75 at 200 yards, 45 points out of a possi
ble 75 at 300 yards and 45 out of a possible 75
at 500 yards. Distinguished marksmanâ A
total annual score at tne three ranges of at
least 192 out. of a .possible 225. â¢ Only dis
tinguished marksmen will be permitted to

Skirmish firing will be at silhouettes at un
known distances between 600 and -200 yards;
individual skirmishes at the group of D, E
and F targets ; company skirmish tiring will
be - target G, as provided in paragraph 390
Blum's small arms firing regulations.
. The regulations number fifty-five and
detail at length the duties of inspectors of

and 60 per cent lourth class. Those averag
ing" less . than 60 per- cent will not be an
nounced in order, and only first-class men
will bo permitted, to compete for the State
medal for revolver practice.
Captain uiebe's military range at Shell
Mound will be arranged to meet the re
quirements of the new regulations, but
some place will nave to be selected for
skirmish firing.
When the last honors were about to be
paid to the late Kate Field it was sug
gested that the National Guard ought to
bo ordered out, but Brigadier-General
Warfield decided that he could not order
out any of his command for the reason
that according to. military etiquette the
deceased lady was not entitled. to honors,
not having been, like Pauline Cushman,
commissioned a major, or like Clara Bar
ton, in the service on . the battle-field.
'The general was willing to do all he could
to pay the proper respects to the memory
of the distinguished woman, even to
granting a regiment or company the right
to parade if either desired to turn out.
Still there was a military display.
Governor" Budd's staff attended in
full uniform and . side arms: Colonel
James and his staff were there in fatigue
uniform and with side arms, and General
Warfield and his staff attended in Prince
Albert coats, black-gloves and plug hats.

Bet-ween 500 and; 600 Imported Annu-

. There are imported . into this country
500 or 600Â° monkeys annually, which come
chiefly from Africa and India by way of
Europe. Natives catch the monkeys and
carry them down to the shipping ports,
where they, sell them to sailors aboard
ship, or more likely to captains of vessels
or to agents of European dealers in ani
mals. Sometimes on shipboard a rope is
tied around a monkey and it is permitted
withina limited space to roam the deck.
Usually*, however, monkeys are shipped
in slatted boxes. ' Some monkeys are
brought direct to this port, but by far the
greater number go to the animal-dealers
in Europe, where the monkeys imported
here are boUiiht. J " ' '"
Occasionally a small monkey is sold for
a pet, but the number now sold for that
purpose is very limited. There is still
some demand for monkeys to be carried
by organ-grinders. . Though the monkey
has disappeared from the city, it is still
carried' to some extent by organ-grinders
in the country. But the great demand
for monkeys comes from the show people.
The monkey is particularly sensitive to
draughts, and to changes of temperature,
to which it is often subject with the con
stantly changing location of a circus
menagerie. The average life of a monkey
under such circumstances is about a year;
the menagerie- practically renews its stock
of monkeys annually.
Under fayprable conditions indoor mon
keys live in captivity for, it may be, twelve
or fifteen years. Monkeys rarely. breed in
captivity.
â¢ One importer of. birds and animals in

in
time and Torsino at her heels, picked out
tbe going to the stretch, with Argentina
traveling quietly ; along on ihe .outside.
Pointed for Â»he wire the favorite took the
lead with Argentina and Summertime r as
close company, and the trio furnished a
rare, exciting trip home. . " . Â° _* ~'X-}
Torsina looked a possible and likely
winner until opposite the. padciock when
her questioned gameness again came be
fore the court, and under a slight touch of
the bat she swerved. Argentina then
forged ahead and in a desperate drive cap
tured the rich prize by a nose. Summer
time, who evidently quit and then re
sponded again, was lapped on tbe place
hor-e. and but for her recent illness might
have been a more obstinate contender.
The winner's time was 2:01 J^.
The other events were al! well contested.
Three of the five first choices won and the
talent experienced another profitable day
of it. t _ ; .
The Spreckels entry Gallant, an 8 to 5
favorite forthe opening seven furlong run,
was in fine fettle, and drawing away from
his field at the far turn won without much
in reserve from San Marco, who was none
too well ridden. " Petrarch secured the
show.
The second number on the card was
another seven-furlong dash. â Billy Ma
grave's moccasin-footed colt, Frank X, was
made an Bto 5 favorite, and with all the
class be won easily from Flashlight,
although Willie Martin drew the finish
pretty fine.
Caspar was at odds on for the fourth
race, over five furlongs, and he won as far
as he .wished from Sweet Willian. Mer
cutio, on whicb Shaw beat the barrier, was
a fair third.
Tom Griffin's four-year-old Monte Fonse
is a repeater. He came out lor the last
race, over a mile and a sixteenth, second
choice to Benamela, and in a drive beat
Dunne's colt a length and a half, starting
at the friendly odds of 16 to 5. La Mascota
was third.
Notes.
The rich Shreve & Co. cup will be' con
tested . for: at Ingleside ' to-day. All the
best handicap horses on the coast will
line up, and racegoers are ; assured of see
ing thegreatest racing ' card of the season

to-day. The first will leave at 1 o'clock
and the second at 1 .20
Jack Riley, the celebrated Eastern
tipster, was successful in picking four of
the five winners yesterday.
Gallant was inclined to stop badly at
the finish. _ . _.
If it were possible to race a horse using
crutches, Frank X would be compelled to
use a pair. He is a grand old cripple.

ASA FI SK'S
ACTIVE LIFE
How the Poor Yankee Lad
. Worked His Way - to â¢ ;
Wealth. :_'
H.s Early Life -p.nt-on th?
Farm and as a Grccer's
Clerk. Â°'
Was Once a State Senatorâ He Built
One of the First Street Rail
\ roads in Boston. ;
Asa Fisk is still confined to his bed at
his residence on the corner of Hayes and
Buchanan streets. His family state that
his condition is not so serious as has been,
reported, although it is doubtful if he will
ever be able to be about or attend to his
business affairs again. His system is
breaking down from old age, accelerated
by a recent attack of pneumonia.
On the '26th of last June Mr. Fisk closed
his oflice and went to his home. Since
then lie lias not been out of the house
over a dozen times. About six weeks ago
be was attacked by a chill, and immedi
ately after the physician said that pneu
monia had set set in. It was a hard strug
gle, 'but the old man's vigor carried him
through the attack, which left him very
weak. The infirmities of age became more
apparent, until now he is constantly con
fined to his ted.. Nevertheless his mind
is active as ever, and he gives directions
as to bis business affairs the same as when
he was in better physical health..
.';'â â . Mr. Fisk is well known in business cir
cles, out in his private affairs he has al
ways maintained a reserve tnat but few of
bis intimate associate, broke through. He
was born at Holtiston, Mass., on Christ
mas, 1818. He comes of bn old New Eng
land family. His early life was spent on
a farm. At the age of 14 young Fisk left
the farm and made his way to Boston and
went to work in a grocery-store; where for
a long time be earned $3 a week and
boarded, lodged and clothed himself. ;.
. This life did not bold out promises, to
the young man and he secured employ
ment in the (inn oi David Kimball & Co.,
who dealt in tailors' goods .and supplies.
It was then that Fisk first demonstrated
that be was possessed of more than ordi
nary business ability. For the. first few;
years his salary was only $100 a year, but
this wa- gradually increased until he held
several positions of tru^t and confidence.
The death of one of the members of the
firm presented an opportunity that the
young man was not slow to take advantage
of,- and soon after he hail a half interest
in the concern, which took the name of
Kimbali & Fisk. . _
In 1856 the death of Mr. Kimball. left
Mr. Fisk the sole proprietor of the busi
ness, but a while after he took in a part
ner. While still engaged in that line Mr. :
Fisk branched out and built the East
Boston and Suffolk â¢ Railroad. During
these years he was a resident of the Mid
dlesex district, a suburb of Boston, and
one term he represented the district in the
Massachusetts Senate of 1859 and 1860.
His close application to business af
fairs impaired his health, and so, in 1863,
Mr. Fisk came to California. He traveled
extensively all over the State, combining
business with pleasure. After an ab
sence of a year or two ; he returned to
Boston and eventually closed out his busi
ness in that city. The remembrance of
California was always . with him, and in
1860 Mr. Fisk returned to this State/bring-,
ing with him about $75,000.
Once again be took a subordinate posi
tion and traveled all over the State pur
chasing wool for the old firm of Ballard &
Hall. _"..; ' .
It was about 1871 or 1872 that Mr. Fisk
started into the , business of a money
broker, a business tbat he lias followed
ever since. His fortune now amounts to
several hundred thousand dollars, but the
exact amount is unknown even to bis
family. He. still owns : large holdings of
real estate in the East as well as in this
State.
Early in life he married, and three
children were the result of that union.
His first wife died and he married again
in tbis State, and two more children were
added to his family.
One wbo is well acquainted with the old
man stated that while Asa -Fisk has the
reputation of driving a hard bargain in
money . matters, there are many good,
traits in his character.
"Few ever heard that Asa Fisk was
given to acts of charity," the gentleman
remarked, "yet to my positive knowledge
he has helped many a poor fellow when
be was sure that it was a worthy, case.'
Upon these matters he always maintained
the strictest secrecy and he never forgave
a person for telling; fit he had been
helped by - the hand of Asa Flak. That
was one of his peculiarities. Another was
that no matter how much be was. abused
he was never known to have replied to any
attacks made, u- on h.m, although many
were most unjust He iransacted;his own
business in his own way and -no one was
obliged to deal with him it he did not. like
his terms.' .But even if all of the hardness
of heart attributed to Asa Fisk were a fact
his good acts will go a long way to count
eract them.". â¢ ' â¢ *^_ -' .

Such Is the Final Dictum
of President Hum

Without Them Montana's Team
; Will Play Fiercer Than
Ever,
Olympic Has Made Some Changes and
' ' Hopes To-Day to Smash the
Butte Record.
Butte will clash with Olympic again
this afternoon. The two big football
teams will line up on the Central Park
gridiron at 2:30 o'clock, no matter what
the weather. :v;v._V â¢
Yesterday final decisions were rendered
by the local representative of the Amateur
Athletic Union upon the alleged profes
sionalism of Hall and Laswell of the
Butte team. He positively declares that
they- shall not play to-day. His investiga
tions since the last game have failed, it
seems, to convince him that he should
again permit these men to play under
protest.
Certain records of the amateur union
show that they are charged with profes
sionalism, not in football-playing, but in
some other branches of athletics some
time ago. Whether or not the charges be
JIM. HOOPER, 6 Feet 3 Inches. Weight, 230 Pounds.
â¢ true does not matter. The men remain
under the ban until they are properly re
instated by the courts that passed upon
their particular cases. .'*'
The charge against Hall is based largely
â¢ upon an allegation that he once received
money for coaching a football team and it
is the more serious of the two.-- Haswell
is charged with, and the printed pro
"' gramme so indicates, that he was entered
'â¢--;. in a Dicycle race as pace-maker for a pro
. fessional rider. C.^

man's life he bas received a. money con
sideration even of trifling smallness for
athletic, work or won a money bet on his
v own athletic performance, or competed
with or against a known professional, he
â¢ is undoubtedly a professional athlete and
could be so declared were the case pushed.
But very often because of the compara

the want of * professional intention, as
with small boys competing in- baseball or
\ otherwise for little amounts, the violators
of the amateur code is not brougbt to task,
nor would he properly be unless he should
\ undertake -to compete in a recognized
amateur contest. â¢ â¢â¢â¢'. . y !â¢'.
â¢ ".'â : As an Instance of the far-reaching
â¢'. effect of the contact of a Professional it
Â might be stated that Heffelfinger, when
here Several years ago, made nearly every
** football player in the big fbur California
. teams a professional. . Â°Â : â¢ "â¢".
--,;-': Heffelfinger. became a professional ath
Â°- lete immediately upon receiving money
for coaching the Berkeley team. He then
played with the Olympics in a regular
Â°, game against Stanford, and although no
.' notice seemed to be taken of it at the
' '-time his undoubted professionalism cer
tainly tainted, according â " to amateur
."rules, air the players that participated in
* that contest and all the others with whom
any of them afterward played in a regular

these men would doubtless have been
readily reinstated because of unitentiun

For the same reason Walter Camp,
Butter worth . and all the other coaches
Â«that have come* here from the East could
be objected to as competitors, in a strictly
. amateur athletic contest. * * {'â *
For some time yesterday the Butte men,
quietly but firmly declared that the Butte
eleven would not play ; unless Hall and

this season means more to them than the
matter of expected gate : receipts to . help
defray expenses. . So far they - have over
wbelmeo every team they have met, and
.' rather than risk a game with two impor

' still hopeful of making some arrangement
"by which Hall and Lowell may al

, not give up hope until they shall have had
* another conference- this evening - with Mr.
Humphreys, president of the Pacific Coast

The game, however, will be played, if
necessary, without Hall and Loswell. Ed

With its team slightly weakened Butte
may be expected to play with redoubled
fury in order to maintain its reputation
pained in a series of remarkable vic
tories. It should be a slashing, crushing,
tornado-like game with plenty of interest
even for the uninitiated.
A particular cause for fierceness > arid
dash in the Butte's playing to-day lies in
in the comments made in The Call- by
Stickney in criticizing the Christmas day
match.. It will be remembered that bis
remarks were practically to the effect that
Buite plays an ignorant style of game
without tricks, and characterized princi
pally by massing weight upon an oppos
ing line. That criticism at tne time
ranked deep in the breasts of ' the Butte
men ana lhey are trow determined to show
Mr. Stickney. that they can fool him by.
their plays. At the same time they are
not 'personally particularly kindly .dis
posed toward the one who so ibeiittled
their ability. '.-. ' ... ... 'â¢'

The arrangements for the funeral of the

and popular club member, were partially
made yesterday. The funeral will take
place from the rooms of the Press Club at
2 o'clock to-morrow. Superior Judge John
Hunt will, as was requested by Mr. Jack
son, make an address.. Judge Hunt re
turned irom Mount Tamalpais last even

and Judge W. P. Lawlor," the executor,
and expressed, his willingness to comply
with the request. ' George Barnes,
John Timmins and â : perhaps other
well-known newspaper : men and in
timate friends of Mr. Jackson will also
make appropriate remarks. The jour
nalist expressly asked that . nothing be
said of him but the truth. â¢
There will be suitable vocal and instru
mental music by the Press Club Quartet
and Rhys Thomas.
The decoration of the rooms will be
simple and effective. There will be palms
and other potted plants and -flowers,. but
no mourning, in accordance with views
long held by the journalist. The remains
of Mr. Jackson have beeu embalmed and
are now at the St. Nicholas Hotel.-. Mrs.
Jackson is bearing up bravely under, her
affliction. She was unremitting in her at
tentions, being always at. his side, and is
now, with intimate friends, in attendance
on the remains. -. ,-..-.. 'y-\
The pall-bearers will include a represen
tative irom each paper, one each from the
Press Club, Bohemian Club and Olympic
Club, and probably Judge Hunt and
Judge Hebbard.
The indications are that there will be.
the largest assemblage of the newspaper
profession at the funeral that have ever
been summoned together here. Doubtless
there - will be a great many besides, for
everybody knew Mr. Jackson, and every
one held' him in high esteem.
After the exercises at the Press Club the
remains | will be . taken jto the mortuary
chapel . at the Odd .Fellows' Cemetery.
Sunday at 2 p. m. the remains will be cre

WOOL MEN AROUSED.
A Communication to Congress Explain*
â¢â ' ing the -Present Situation aiid
Suggesting a Remedy.
The California Wool Association, has
sent the following communication to the
Senators and members of Congress; also
to the members of the Ways and Means
Committee of the House of Representa
tives, relative to the hearing of _ the pros
pective tariff on wool on the 6th prox.
San Francisco, Dec. 28, 1896.
Dear Sir: WeVvish t o call your attention
and careful consideration to the following
facts concerning the wool industry. _
The decrease in the clip of the United States
for the year 1896 was enormous, and lor 1897
will be yet more disastrous. In addition to
this enormous falling oS in production prices
have fallen so low that it no longer pays the
cost of growing. In- many instances in our
State during the past two years -well known
wool-growers have offered their fall clip of
wool to any one who would shear and take it
away, because the expenses of shearing and
marketing were greater than lis value, thus
showing the deplorable condition of the wool
industry. Owing to this serious condition of
affairs the California wool clip, will show a
loss for 1896 of fully 6,000,000 pounds,' and
the decline in the value of sheep has been
abou.t 70 per cent. >â _ ./â.Â».
Prices of spring California wool before the .
Wilson tariff ranged' from 12 to 22 cents;
prices of spring California wool now range
from 4 to 12 cents; prices of fall California
wool before the Wilson tariff ranged from 7 to
15 cents; prices of fall California wool now.
range from 2 to 9 cents; prices of scoured Cal
ifornia-wool before the Wilson c tariff ranged
from 30 to 55 cents; prices oi scoured Califor
nia wool now range from 12 to 30 cents. v
Tne manufacturing interests of the country
have ; also suffered greatly, t Our domestic
manufacturers cannot successfully compete
with the low 'wages paid labor in foreign
countries. . â¢'-'-".Â» . ..- ..,'.,' â¢â _" â  . 'Â â¢
. Wares in England are much lower than in.
the United States, and in France and Germany,
still lower. -"â¢â *'.-â  â¢
: Japan is rapidly becoming a manufacturing
nation. The wages are absurdly, low, being
from 38 cents a day for their best operators
down to 3 cents and 5 cents lor .unskilled
labor. y ,'* ;":
" â  The immense importations of wool, shoddy,
waste, etc., have lessened the demand for raw
material, labor and manufactured product â to
the detriment of the entire population of the
United States. . ..-â -., -./'., y 'â' .
The effect of this has been to enforce idle
ness and to' stop nearly 75 per cent of the
woolen machinery in the United States within
the past year. There are in the State of Cali
fornia alone seven scouring-mills, employing
from 400 to 500 hands, which have been very
disastrously affected by the enormous importa
tion of scoured wool from foreign countries.
A thorough protective tariff for both wool
and woolens.' with specific and not ad valorem
duty for wool, and a combined specific .and
ad valorem duty for goods, neither to be less.
than the McKinley tariff, will Insure reason*
able prosperity tor our wnole country. _ ..-<â¢â--. i

THE NEW PANTOMIME
Miss Fuller Appears at the
California in "A Paris
Tragedy."
La Loie Is Not Considered So : Good a
Mimist as She Is a
Dancer. .-..'
. "La Loie" Fuller reappeared at the Cal
ifornia Theater last night for an engage
ment of four nights and two -. matinees.
She had strengthened her programme for
the' occasion by. a new .! Chinese dance
which. she has been preparing for. the edi
fication of Li Hung Chang, and also by
"A Paris Tragedy," â  a pantomime which
was described on the programme as being
"from the French," although pantomime,;
being a universal. language, it was . diffi
cult to see where the translation came in.
;." "A Paris Tragedy" interested the
audience very much, partly, no doubt,
because of the novelty of such a style of
entertainment .in. this | City. At odd
moments there were* sounds as of stifled
hilarity from the darkened and crowded
bouse, that was when . the pantomime
showed a tendency to become French. On
the whole, "A Paris Tragedy" evidently
gave satisfaction.
Miss Fuller inaugurated an interesting
departure in her pantomime by playing it
to a symphony of : color, instead - otyto a
musical accompaniment.- The stage was
set as a sumptuous boudoir, with vistas of
a sleeping-apartment beyond, and every
thing was bathed in a halo of rainbow
tinted light. The foreground was a glow
of gold, the middle distances were steeped
in all the latest and most fashionable
chromatic tints . and the background was
steeped in a lurid red, which was no doubt
intended to be -the leading motive.of the
tragedy.'
"La Loie" was discovered in, a dormant
condition reclining on a -couch under the
rays of the yellow light when the curtain
rose in pantomime, she refused her desire
for a little more sleep and a little more
slumber, shook off her slippers and curled
up again in a neglige attitude. The maid
Fanchon,. played" by Helen i Foster .Vane,
entered on tiptoe and watched madame's
slumbers; then she arranged flowers about
the room and unpacked sundry boxes of
gorgeous apparel for her mistress, express-'
ing horror and' indignation at the length
of the bill. ""'â ";'.'â¢ = â¢":..;,- V'.-'v..". . ;â â¢ ' 'â '_-.
In leaving the room Fanchon made a
noise and aroused â¢ madame, who seemed
to be terribly bored, and after putting on
her slippers, whiled away the time by eat
ing candy and other diversions known to
the rich unemployed; she also danced a
very little dance, in which a voluminous
wrapper figured conspicuously. "â â 
â â _ Finally madame discarded the wrapper
to put on some of the gorgeous apparel
that her maid' had unpacked, and it was
here that' th - French element came in
most strongly, for the lingerie beneath the
wrapper was even-more scanty, than that
affected by Katherine Kidder in "Mme.
Sans Gene," and the audience gave a stifled
titter when they, beheld it. " V ââ¢ -'-" ,*â¢ Â°
After arraying .. herself sumptuously
"La Loie" danced. another simple dance,
which was interrupted by the . arrival of
monsieur, a part portrayed by Howard
Kyle. Monsieur gave madame: jewels
after she bad searched his pockets for
them, and the ' search revealed the fact
that he carried pistols- and a package of
letters. Those, letters aroused madame's
suspicions. She waited till monsieur had
fallen asleep on the" sumptuous ' lounge
and then she stole them .from his pocket,
read tbem, and was expressing horror and
despair when monsieur awoke. y 'â 'â¢.
instead of being contrite he defied his
wife, and,' snatching up ons of the pistols,
she shot him. A struggle ensued, which re
sulted in a double . tragedy, and the cur
tain went down on two Fr.nch corpses. â 
" The above was '.the plot -of â â¢. "A Paris
Tragedy," which all who ran mignt read,
even the Celestials, some of whom had
gone in state to see "La Loie." - . :.; .
It would be idle to pretend that any of
the performers showed themselves to be
trained v mimists. The danseuse and . the
mime are seldom contained in one per
son, and expressive ,as I Mi3s â¢ Fuller > is,
she is not' a trained mime. Her. panto
mine was very effective: and. expressive,
however, particularly 'Â". in â¢ â  tbe â¢ stronger
scenes, where the continuation and tragedy!
began, and all through "A Paris Tragedy
no words - were" necessary :to express the
thought supposed to be passing through
her mind.
'â¢''â  ' Howard Kyle was - satisfactory as the
husband and Helen Foster Vane played
Fanchon prettily. -
v^ "A Paris Tragedy " was preceded , by the
two-act . ; play, v "Sweethearts," y in 4 which
Howard Kyle 'and ''Helen' Foster Vane
played the leading parts. The entertain
ment . concluded .with the dances which!
have made "La Loie" Fuller famous. â¢

A Remarkable Discovery..
All Paris just now, according to the
Journal, ''is . flocking to 'â . 28 ; Rue ; Ravig
nan, Montmartre, where, a few days 'ago,
a.; most remarkable discovery. was .made.
In this neighborhood-are the ruins of the
ancient monastery of the' Benedictines
and other old buildings used by the
Brothers, most ot which are also giving
way to the .ravages of time. At 28 Rue
Ravignan Mmc Berthelot keeps a grocery
store. v. She sleeps .in a small chamber in
the rear that at one time was probably
used as an oratory. _- , . ';..,,.___._.:.!
;.'y Mm.. Berthelot, n'oticin? that the tiles
on the floor of- the chamber' gave forth a
hollow sound as she stepped upon thorn,
and thinking that a'cella*r there would be
very convenient ; for her business, sent for
a mason ' and v bad. the tiles removed. A
flight of -stone steps .was revealed, leading
into a labyrinth of passages. The author
.ities _, have now taken -possessions of *; the
place and a systematic investigation is be
ing conducted. Many relics Bave, been
found, and it is believed that much light
is likely to be thrown upon, the history of
â¢ Paris during the fourteenth century. * ** ;

- The man who has been so prominent an
actor through all these varied scenes is
now 77 years old, but is still very active.
Be is a native of Vermont, and has trav
eled extensively in Europe, ; as well as in
this country. ; Mr. Farr is a strong be
liever in â â¢ Mormortism and in Joseph
Smith and Brigham Young. y "â¢.;;.. . ..."
"Joseph Smith was the greatest colonizer ;
of this or any age," said 'he yesterday.
"He was more like Mohammed than any
one I can think of in his breadth of mind
and determination of purpose. Yet 'he
was a singularly affable and agreeable
man. Everybody liked him. He .was. a
very positive an, but his judgment was
good, and when other men saw this they
fell right in with him. 'X; ''. ~ o y
"There was another thing about him: T
When he went to bed be slept. He was
not nervous. ". He figured broadly., .but
when he had done a day's .work he dis
missed it from his mind. It was thus that
the " next day he was ready for, other
things. Â- . * . '
"The day is fast coming when he will be
regarded as the greatest man' that ever
livedâ not greater than Christ, but he was
not" a â¢ man; ; he was .: God. .But be , was
the greatest man that ever lived. ."â  -
â X ''The singular < thing about all those
temples, too, was that the pattern of tbem
all v was ; given: by revelation to "Joseph
Smith .before he died. \ ; He ; knew they
would all.be completed just as they were.
How could they ever have j. been I finished
as they are if it had not been for this reve
lation. "He was certainly a very wonder
ful man. Brigham Youn -, who succeeded,
him, was also a great colonizer. He . like
wise was a very affable and agreeable man,
and numbered friends by thousands.. He
had a positive nature, too, and a judgment
that won people over to him." v.
v "As to the Mormon church; it is mov
ing steadily forward. In Utah the people
are progressing _in every, way, as .well as
could be expected. The church i has be
tween 250,000 and 300,000} members now,
and, besides, have between . 1200 and
â 1300 missionaries out in the field, in differ-
ent places.' ; v.--'.i--.r;'?: ._-"â 'â 'â â 'â ':;.;

ately after the election, but it got bad
after that, and now 'it has improved -a
little.' j/1 â¢ think X the * outlook â  is Â» as good
there as anywhere I know about."-
It was in 1868 and pa,rt of c 1869 that Mr.
ITarr built 200 miles of the Central Pacific
road, oh the stretch between Ogden- and ; a
point near Humboldt 'Wells. Tbe officials
of the proposed road tried to get Brigham
Young to take the contract, but he already
had a big Union Pacific contract- east of
Ogden. President Young recommended
Mr. Farr, and he agreed to take the con
tract. There was great between the
two roads, and '< the Union Pacific r\ was
making every effort to get to Humboldt
Wells first. -Whichever road ; got there
first was to get $48,000 a mile for* its grad
ing. . Mr. Farr secured all the men that
could be got in Utah, and beat out on the
work. At one time he had 3000 men and
many hundreds of teams employed. . Pre
viously he had heavy contracts on the
Utah Central, and afterward on the Rio
Grande. "", . \. -
Mr. Farr will be here several days, and
will then probably visit Southern Califor

".' Tbe advent of the new year was hailed
with horns. There .: were jlarge horns and
small horns and horns of every size, shape
and style in the hands of men and women
and boys and girls. The horn-blowers be
gan to throng Market and Kearny streets
early in the evening, and by midnight
there was a column of footers extending
on Market street from Van Ness avenue
to Kearny street, and on Kearny from
Lotta's fountain to Montgomery avenue.
Every one blew his own horn lustily. At
first the girls were shy ot blowing, but
they took courage as the evening wore on
and tooted as vigorously, as their brothers.
The crowd w&s good-natured and few
resented tlie blowing of horns in their
ears. The custom of â¢ horn blowing to
greet the coming and send out the going
year . is now so Well . established "â in '.. San
Francisco that every one expectS the din.
. The clear sky and "bracing" atmosphere
. last night invited outdoor exercise and so
the crowds on . the street were ul_usualiy
large. > At the hour of midnight, when the
old year crossed ' the line, there were ex
plosions of gunpowder and a great chorus
of tooting. , ...
The noise then; gradually subsided and
the ;*â¢ blowers wended . their way to their
homes. At the leading saloons, hotel?,
clubs and restaurants refreshments,
mostly liquid, were ordered in honor of the
year 1897. -...-.: .y ; v/ v...;- v.v , 0 -;..y *'

SIXTY MILES AN HOUR.
Mechanical Phase of a Run at Extra
â¢ ordinary Speed. '-
At sixty miles an hour the resistance of
a train is four times as great as it is at
thirty ; miles that is, the fuel --mist be
four times as great in the one case as in
the other. But at sixty miles an horr this
fuel must be exerted fof a given dfctance
in half the time that it is at ; thirty niles,
so that the amount of power exertei and
steam generated in a given period of time
must be eight times as great at tbe aster
speed. - This means that; the capaciy of
the boiler, cylinders and otber partsmust
be greater, with a corresponding adiiiion
to the weight of the machine. ,"_)
Obviously, therefore, if the weigh, per
wheel, on account of the limit of wight
that the rails ..will". carry, is limitei, we
soon reach a point .when the drying,
wheels and other; parts cannot be ftrtber
enlarged, and then we reach the liaxi
mum speed. The nice adjustment nces
sary of the various parts of these imnense
engines may be indicated by some Agues
as io the work performed by these ]arts
when the locomotive is working at -igh
speed. Take a passenger engine on my
of the big railroads. At sixty mile. an
hour a driving-wheel five and a half eet
in diameter revolves five times every ec
ond. * ' . . â 
Now, the reciprocating parts of e.ch
cylinder, including one piston, piston nd,
crosshead and connecting rod, weighng
about 650 pound?, must move back aid
forth a distance equal to the ' strole,
usually two feet, every time the wheel in
volves, or in a fifth of a second. It stars
from a state of rest at the end of each
stroke of the piston and must acquire,
velocity of, thirty-two feet per second it.
one-twentieth of a second and must b>
brought* to a state of rest in the samt
period of time. - Â*- yy ""' . â¢
A piston 18 inches in diameter has an
area of _54}_ square inches. Steam of 150
pounds pressure per square inch would
therefore exert a force on the piston equal
to 38,175 pounds. This force is applied
alternately on each side of the piston ten
times in a second. Budget, .
To prevent the flame of a lamp from*
daring in a gust of wind and thus brcaic
ing the chimney a Louisiana man has in- -,
vented a wire gauze hood fastened to the
top of the chimney, the idea being to
break the force of the wind without hin
dering the draft. ' "3 . v;'":

It really seems strange, when the, rem- '

allow themselves to remain subject to
I such troubles. Dr. Pieree's Pleasant Pel-
lets 'cure constipation. That means that
they are good for biliousness, sick and
bilious headaches, indigestion, sour stom-
ach, liver troubles, .windy belchings,
*' heart-burn,'.'; flatulence and dyspepsia.
They are tiny, sugar-coated granules that
the merest child will' take readily. They
are r mild, gentle, quick and efficient.
They are of purely vegetable composition
and work in strict accord with nature.
They cause no griping and are as pleasant
in their action â  as . they are pleasant to
take.' , Their â¢ help lasts. Therefore 1 you
don't become a slave to their use as with
other pills. Once nsed they are always
in favor. One little Pellet is a laxative,
two are mildly cathartic. One 'Pellet
taken, after dinner .will promote digestion
and to relieve distress from over eating
they are unequaled. fl
CAUTION.â Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets-
it's an easy name to remember. Don't let a de-
signing druggist talk you into " something just

sell them. That's why you had better not takte
