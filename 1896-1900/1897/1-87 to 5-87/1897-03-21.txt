A patriotic American audience, gstb
ered in sympathy with a struggling pec
ple who suffer that they may be free, was
that assembled at Metropolitan Temple
last evening. , \ . :
- Never was the spirit of liberty more
evident. It was. represented in 'the fas
.toons of red, white and bine, and in the
star of Cuba libre, which- were the main
features of the decorations. It welled
from hearts throbbing with the ardor of
patriotism and the compassion of hu
manity. ; â¢â lis';-"'''
It was voiced in the eloquence of gifted
speakers, whose art is never so noble, so
effective and so sublime as when invoked
in the cause of trodden people bat
tling for freedom.
The hall was crowdedâ crowded with
such an assemblage as that auditorum
bas seldom witnessed. There was a notice
able absence of the scoffers and the curi
ous who formed a material element in re
cent campaign meetings. There was not
in evidence to any, considerable extent

At Times During the Meeting at Metropolitan Temple Last Night the Audience Arose and Cheered for Cuba i Libre.
Enthusiasm Prevailed From the Opening, to the End of the Great Demonstration. 'â â â â â  "l^ss

thusiastic earnest. ; . "' ' /â ?"â ;
The audience listened eagerly to the
word of the ! speakers. . They murmured
indignantly during; oratorical .pauses in
the recital of- the crimes and oppressions
of the Spanish Governmentand soldiery.
They applauded 10 the echo the names of
Gomez, of Garcia and of Maceo. They
cheered until' the wall** seemed to vibrate
at the mention of America's .National
heroes, Washington and: Lincoln, - Gomez
and' Maceoâ all > honored names in the
cause of liberty. In the struggle for free
dom all men are copatriots. '
S loom has a San Francisco audience
listened to such eloquence. . The speakers
were: at their. best, inspired by the just
ness of their cause and the keen sympathy
of their auditors. It is doubtful if many
of the latter considered the poetic" perora
tions, -the powerful- periods, the striking
climaxes and the timely metaphors of, the
orators. They only knew that their
hearts were stirred, .that *â¢' before v. them
they saw the picture of Cuba bleed int.*

of a cruel' despotism, the deeds of brave
men and the hope of j liberty's triumph.
These things tbey saw portrayed in the
bright colors of vivid imagery, and from
breasts rilled with that love of justice and
lof right â¢ which .is strong in every true
American burst forth the indignation and
the sympathy which the tales of Spanish
atrocities have been, engendering day by
day.
There was ' not an address, during the
evening which did not appeal strongly to
the audience. .To the scholarly address
of the Mayor, the keen arraignment by
Attorney. William H. Jordan of Spanish
iniquities, the patriotic remarks of Henry*
E. Highton, the polished eloquence of
Samuel. M.'Sbortridge/and^ the powerful
appeal of Colonel T. V. Eddyâ all were
greeted by the audience with ardent en
thusiasm. v
A brass band furnished music for the
occasion and its selections were heartily
received. The numbers were not classi
cal, neither were they new. For such an
audience. "The Star-spangled Banner,"
"America," "March iDg Through Georgia"
and kindred airs which recall the names
of patriots and the acts of heroes, were
plenty good enoueh. And for an audience
assembled in the name' of humanity and
freedom the b st is scarcely good enough.
It was' nearly 9 o'clock when Mayor
Phelan called the meeting to order. His
appearance was the signal for the first
round j of. applause, which was repeated
many time** during, the course of his ad
dress. , v Tie chief executive of - the munici
pality spoke as follows : * ;; , 5? ,; ,r T;'
.' =" Ladies and Gentlemen: duty has de-
I ' volved, upon me of calling this meeting to or
der. About a month-: ago 1 was in receipt of a
I coftimunicatlbn' from the-' Cuban League of
America, with jj headquarters 'â  in 1 Now g York ,
j asking that this remote City of San Francisco
form a committee, for the purpose oLco-oper*
i ating * with \ the parent organization;' The or
ganization had but a single object, and that
was to stir, up the American people to a reall-
j zatlon of their duty in helping by their moral
j support and by material aid the .patriots of
Cuba Ito : regain " their freedom and their lib
erty: | [Applause." No American' community
j could possibly be deaf to such' an appeal, and
I with the 'co-operation of the Cuban League of
i San Francisco, already formed, I was enabled
to select from your fellow-citizens fifty gentle
! men who promised*: their : active support and
j co-operation. That committee- of .fifty ,- has
called ' this demonstration. Such ) meetings
have 1 been _â¢ held throughout the country, and
the organization in New York is a most repre
sentative ' one. Every man who loves justice
and hates inUjuitv belongs to that - society in
the metropolis of our countryâ in the city of
New York. . [Applause] "
1 :1 will not tell you, because you are already
informedâ it is current history. I The story of
Cuba! how lor years and years 7 the people
have been dissatisfied with the yoke of Spain;
that their condition is parallel to the condition
of America before the Revolution. A foreign
Government sought to impose upon "It a yoke
which was galling and which freemen could
not bear, and when they so 'imposed taxation
upon the* American colonies In those daysâ a
taxation to which the American colonists not
only refused to consent, - nor had they any
means in a parliamentary sense of consenting,
but against which they repeatedly protested,
stating the justice of their cause. After, the
parent Government in England, in accordance
with its world-wide and life-long, policy of ex
acting tribute from dependencies, had refused
to give them justice, they ..rose; up ;in arms.
Well, of what use were the arms of America
against the first power in Europe ? , * *
; It would seem a very : unequal struggle, but
as Edward Everett Raid, it was the spirit of the
cause which supplied the place of arms "and
munitions of war and gave them victory, be
cause when men believe themselves to be right
in any cause -they are' thrice armed. Thrice
armed \ is 'he who | has % his quarrel just, and
they but help ; it, though locked up in .steel,
whose conscience with injustice is tainted.
We see the same struggle to-day in Crete and
Greece of ancient. renown. ,'. We see ' in' Cuba' a
people struggling for freedom and it is impossi
ble that men can be free under a yoke of a Gov
ernment against ,' which they rebel, because
liberty is Impossible without order and order
is impossible | without government, and gov
ernment in any. sense of the term is impossi
ble without a settled, conviction on the pari of
the people of its legitimacy and. their obliga
tions in conscience to obey it. -ji* V:; â ;
' .'Now, so long as that Bourbon folly, the folly
of those men of whom weare told they learn
nothing and never forget, of trying, to rule a
: people .: which â¢is â¢* animated ' with a', spirit of
I freedom in that remote corner of the globe,
the beautiful islauOi.. C ibs; so lon.?; as, th(!y.

themselves in an > international trouble, but
they will 5 fail in their purpose*Â©! governing,
those people nnd of exacting that tribute from

They 3 hold *Itas j a dependency, 'al tributary
state. Their only Interest ' in** Cuba j is *to ex
tract tribute from the labor and: the industry
of the people, 1 in which we* are free -'to; admit
that the fiscal policy "of Spain is a 'wise* one,
because tbey have no other means of ' support,
but these Cubans tell them that they cannot
look to Cuba for ill-gotten gains. [Applause.]
Ladies j and '"gentlemen, !. this ; is so /old 'a'
â tory, 1 this - struggle "of a people not numer
ously strong, strong in their love of free-
dom, that it can have but one solution. '. .

arms and the munitions of war . has denied
them, and it is" the duty of the United State*.
mindful of Its own history,' to hold out a hand
to a suffering" people^ and aid them to a real
ization of those great principles of 'freedom
1 which we ourselves enjoy. / [Applause^ "^ ' :>'

1 account, we are here to-night, simply repre
sen ting a ' part jof the American States doing

and hope and support â to the people of Cuba.
California Isa new. State, but she has done
much for the cause of freedom. She put free
dom into her constitution at the very incep
tion of her history, when It was a question
whether she would be for slavery or against it,
and so true has she. been to these principles
that when the black man was despised as a
human chattel * she offered him the same
privileges which the white population en
joyed. â ' **" ** â¢'.ââ¢â â  ,'.- ' '-'.-' ' ' % â ".''*.
She recognized the blacks as human beings
entitled, to . freedom,*, and that freedom was
ultimately given to them after a most terrible
war, costing a million human lives and mil
lions of treasure, and probably the best type of
man who went to that battle from this coastâ
and he is a Calif ornian we will always claim
as the type of the soldier of freedomâ you
will | remember, Edward Dickinson Baker.
[Applause.] , : : >iv\V-/ r v Â'. '; ':â .-. .*:
Baker was inflamed with the love of liberty,
and haying- been sent to the Senate of the
United States ;he \ threw aside the honors | of
peace and seizing the sword rushed into the
forefront of the battle and died fighting at the
very. beginning of the war. â  '-: , i> "j
- ; But not alone has he bequeathed to us his
example, but be has j bequeathed to us golden
words 'of eloquence 'which tell so beautifully
the story of freedom and its Invincibility that
I am moved to repeat them! because they have
been with *me since schooldays almost fas
household words. He said ." "Long years ago
I I took; .my stand Iby freedom,: and .where in
youth -my â  fee " were , planted . there my man

not ashamed, of freedom; I, rejoice in her

meet them again face to fact* fully clad in
complete steel and brandishing in her strong
right hand v sword red 'with" insufferable
light.'.' [Applause]. f* * â¢/''.-' *'
That is the story of freedom. She cannot be
put down nor exterminated. Her friends,
even, may desert her; her foes i may gather
round her, and even in the darkest days of the
Cuban struggle you and I, who ; knew. the life
long/history of freedom, knew that it was
merely deferring the 'glorious end , that ulti
mately these men must triumph,' and triumph
they wilL â  And such support as we give her
to-night, r and â¢ such as Congress i has given,
merely advances the glorious day when Cuba
will take her place among the free nations of
the world. [Loud applause.] "

6 o'clock this morning the box containing

box to the committee-room in the State

box arid proceeded to examine the thirty
pounds of telegrams therein contained.
About two hours later Superintendent
Jaynes! of. the Western Union Telegraph
Company appeared'. with his attorney;
Judge K. B. Carpenter, and demanded ad

kicked the door and. broke the lock, over :

papers on v ' his arm, ail eyes were turned
toward him. Hi's*' aspect" was grave, as
thougli he felt be bad a solemn duty to
perform.'' - The interest 'with which he was
regarded' was heightened by the fact that
it had become known i that fourteen tele
grams were made a part of the report. *
At a lull in the proceedings Melick an
nounced that his committee was ready to
report, the announcement at once
stilled the noise of conversation. *,
II Clerk Duckworth received the bundle of
papers, from the bottom ;of ; which pro
truded some green -and V: yellow sheets.
Tbesa were the fourteen- dispatches men
tioned in the report, and if the lire of the
concentrated eaze of a .large number of
people could bum there would have been
nothing left of the report but smoke. ; . -
, The introductory part of . tne document
was rather , tame . and ' formal. It recited
the resolution under. which the committee
had been appointed. "â¢> It followed with the
names of some of the principal witnesses
examined, reciting the fact of tlie rental
of the telegraph people to answer certain
questions, and then came down to the
issue/ which the Clerk read in a clear, de
liberate voice.
After reciting the fact that the com
mittee ; nad . examined various mem
of the Assembly, ; the report says: "Ou
March 19, George Senf, manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company, in
Sacramento, was subpenaed. .He refused
to answer certain questions. Taken - be

answered the questions and was remanded

any kind, shatter men's reputations for
the remainder of their lives. Those " in
the second row were on their feet leaning
over tlie shoulders of those in the front
row and craning their necks lorward.
"Read the telegrams," shouted Wright,
observing the indecision of the clerk and
the inquiring expression of Speaker
Coombs' face. .
Cutter caught the Speaker's eye. He
was recognized and spoke clearly and de
liberately : â¢ â â -...
"Mr. SpeaEer and Gentlemen of tho
Assembly: On behalf of the Western
Union Telegraph Company, 4 which con
siders the action of this committee an
outrage and a violation of tbe laws of this
State, I. for one, demand tbat these tele
grams be not read."
Melick raised the point of order that the
reading of the report was not yet fin
ished. ; y ~V' ." 'â â 
Before the Speaker could decide the
point of order Burnett shouted, "Mr.
Sneaker, on behalf of the people of the
State of California and the State Legisla
ture, I demand that t ey be read."
- ' Cutter, in clear-cut accents, mocking the
tone of Burnett, exclaimed, "On behalf of
the San Francisco Examiner, and not on
behalf of the Legislature or of the people
of this State." ; ':>v*^;-' '" '
This statement was greeted with a laugh
at the expense of Mr. Burnett, whose
manner was rather too tragic and dramatic
lor the occasion.
North of Alameda rose to a point of
order ou the ground that the gentleman
was not speaking to the question. .
The Sneaker ruled that the point of
- order was not well taken. *.
"My point of order," said Melick, ''is
that he clerk has not yet finished read
ing the report." . â¢
"The point of order is not well taken,"
said Coombs. -
I*' Caminetti arose to say something, but
he was cut short by Cutter, who said:
"The gentleman from Amador may think
that the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany, being a corporation, has no ri hts
simply because it is a corporation. The
superintendent of that company had
served upon him a subpena to produce
one telegram and no mora. He agreed to
produce it, but instead of allowing him to
do so, the committee sent orders to stop a
box containing telegrams sent from Sacra
mento to all parts of the State and to all
persons during the last fifteen or twenty
days. They take that box .by force and
they broa ht it to tbe Capitol and ex
amined all the telegrams of business men
and private personsâ private communica
tions as sacred a-> a letter enclosed in an
envelope under the seal of the Govern
ment of the United States. ...
"It is contrary to morals and the law and
has no sanction ot justice. .Let those tel
egrams that the company is ready to pro
duce, and that the committee has referred
to, be produced and read, not the ones
which this commit.cc has taken* in defi
ance of Jaw, and which expose private in
terests of persons not members of this
House. They now produce .those tele
-grams which they, say appear to bein
criminating, but no matter bow incrimi
nating they may be they should not be
read, considering the manner in which i
they were obtained, and . the gentlemen
wiil find out to tbeir sorrow that the law i
will not permit it." Â ,â..
Wright renewed his motion, and Cross j
moved as an amendment that the tele- i
gram referred to in the warrant be read in- ,
stead of the others. .."â  % '--," -â¢."*â¢ : ,
Belsbaw said that while, he did not.ap
prove of the manner in which tha com-,
mittee had obtained the telegrams, be
thought that tbey should be read, as they
were now before the house-. He believed
that the method used by the committee
was contrary to law, but be wanted to
know the contents of the dispatches. â¢' "'
Cross of Los Angeles argued that the
Assembly had no more right-to read any
dispatch than the one mentioned in the
sub* ce'na than they had to read a dispatch

ford was .that the question was not how
"these telegrams came into the possession
of the committee," but whether they should
be read or. not. ; Telegrams were not men
tioned in the code as privileged communi
cations. _ .*...-
Burnett of the committee said it was
barely possible from the attitude of some
of th** members of the Assembly that they
did not want an investigation. "But," he
added, "1 tell you, gentlemen, if you
don't want an investigation you have
appointed the wrong committee. We
wanted to get that box and the telegrams,
and we got them."
"You have not got . their contents yet,"
said Cross. .' " -
'"We took the box to room 72 in this
building," resumed Burnett. "We fully
realized the power of the great corpora
tion and the risk we were taking in defy
ing tbat corporation, but as men and citi
zens of the great State of California we
deemed it our duty to do our best to get
the facts. During the course of that inves
tigation Mr. Jaynes, manager of the West
ern Union Telegraph Company, came to
the door and when we refused to admit
him be broke that door in and broke the
lock, and we had to barricade tbat door
with a table.
â¢'I ordered Jaynes out of the room and
he swore. We ordered him under arrest.
He told us that they would follow us. to
the ends of the earth and Mr. Melick made
the remark that if they followed him they
would get lost among the cactus. -
,"We,w,ere told that power lay with the
people, and we . exercised that power re
gardless of where .the lightning would
strike.. I care not a rap. I would have
done my duty ana got that box of tele
grams if 1 had known- that it would have
stricken.down. the Govern r of California
or the President of this great Republic. It
is the first lime in California that the
Western Union, has been compelled to
disgorg* telegrams that might be incrim
inating." " ... ;;V-=
Price urged that the dispatches be read.
,The House, on .a viva-voce vote, decided
tbat the telegrams be read.
â¢Power of San Francisco demanded that
the telegrams should be read. The first
dispatch was dated March 6, and was ad

After the reading of the dispatch Clark

authorizing the Attorney-General to act

ber thereof in any suit that may be
brought against them in their official ca
pacity. Tne resolution was adopted. .
Power of San Francisco took the floor at

privilege. He said:
"The San Francisco Examiner has seen
tit to make certain charges" and insinua
tions against me in regard to this alleged
bribery in the coyote bill matter. I got
up on the -or of this House and chal
lenged j them to make direct: charges
against me on which I could base a libel
suit. They didn't do it, hut continued
their insinuations. As the committee has
produced the reports and telegrams in
relation to this matter, I ask this House
to take such action as they:, may see hi
with me. lam a young man starting out
in life, and I don't want my reputation to
be blasted by t c Exam -ncr, or any other
paper. 1 ask this Assembly to take action

Ennis of Sacramento introduced a reso

Whereas, The San Francisco Examiner nas
made cer.tiin charges against John W. Power;

Examiner; therefore be it
Resolved, That the members of this Assem
bly fully exonerate John W. Power from the
charges of the Examiner or any other paper.
North of Alameda opposed the resolu
tion on the ground that no particular
member needed a vindication at the hands
of the House and moved to lay the reso
lution on the table. ' '
Jones of San- Francisco said that a
grave charge had been made against tbe
young man that: might ruin him for life.

"If -they want to fall down . before tbe

Frank Jaynes, superintendent of the
Western Union Company, who was at
Sacramento yesterday, returned iastnieht.
He was seen at his home on Bush street
and asked why he hal boxed up the tele
grams and started them out. of the State.
His face flushed and he replied with great
vehemence: -.V.'/-":- â 'â â¢.- ."- .
"Simply because we heard that this
committee proposed to ransack our entire
oflice and call up any man in our employ
as a witness, thus completely, disorganiz
ing us and keeping us from conducting
our business. This would injure \us
greatly. For this reason I boxed up these
dispatches and sent them away. â¢'

thi : that hereafter when the Legislature

have anything to do with legislation and

"It is the work of the Examiner in its
alleged purity campaign. There is noth
ing in it, either, on the face ot it There
is nothing in all these dispatches to show
that there has been any bribery. They
simply show the work of a loDbyist. It is
ridiculous. 'â¢'â¢ 'â¢'
"I was up there to-day when this com
mittee was jawing around over dispatches
miscellaneously and . " acting as ; though
they bad made an extraordinary discov
ery. . It was absurd. There 'we, . the of
ficials of the company, , stood ready to
offer any explanation asked, and yet they
clawed around as though they had struck
a mare's nest. 1 was intensely indignant.
"They accused meâ this committee did
âof breaking open a door, and one of the
committee loudly talked about having me
arrested and sent to' jail. .- I never .broke
open any door. I was merely standing
there.' /-;.:' 'â¢â¢"â -. ,":â :;.-,-. ,-â¢: . . ;. - .-'"V

"There is more bshind this than most

two days have been signs of tbe coming
dissolu ion of f. the Legislature. .;*' Senators
and Assemblymen have been * busy desk
cleaning,' getting tbeir codes, ; files, etc.,
"ready for packing/ and strewing the floor
with discarded bills, reports and other
documents, until the carpet was literally
buried under the f flood, In 'every aisle
were boxes and wastebaskets, with porters
and pages stuffing into them every article
of usefulness they could lay their bands
upon, and, in many instances, any old
thing. Each one's ambition seemed to be
to get his] box or basket filled.
; - In the Senate matters droned along this;
morning in the consideration of Assembly,
amendments to Senate bills. The clock
had been stopped at 11:25 p. St., as the
hour for adjournment hud ; been "fixed at
12 M.; Atl2:4oÂ»p. m. Bulla moved that a
recess be' taken for two hours until ,11:45
a. M., and, this, was agreed to, the j hope
bein i ; that by , that r time the Assembly
wouid have agreed to the Senate's amend*
ments to the tax-levy bill and would send
it to the Governor. "â¢->' ' ; . .:
But the Assembly refused to concur and
a free conference committee' hart tn be
appointed to adjust the differences. Wuen
the!/ Senate reconvened -at . about 1 8
o'clock in the afternoon I the I confer
ence committee was still ;in .- hot
debate, U> and the / afternoon , was
spent in passing constitutional amend
ments and joint resolutions. This went
on for two hours arid a half, and at 5:30
p. m. Voorheis moved to take a- recess un- i
til 11:50 a. m. The motion carried and the
chair ruled that this meant Bp. M. , : .
Shortly after; reconvening the report of
the.Tax-levy Conference committee was
submitted. It provides for the. raising of
$10,020,000 and mean a tax levy of 41%
cents, exclusive of the 2 cent tax for.'tue
State .University. This is $360,000 more
than provided in the bill as originally in
troduced in the Assembly on the Gov
ernor's recommendation, and with the
$1,250,0 surplus in the treasury will give
$11,270,000 for maintaining the State Gov
ernment in ? all its departments for the
next two years, beginning July, 1897. In
this form the bill was passed.
;â¢â  Senator Bulla introduced a resolution
extending the thanks of ' the Senate to
President Jeter fori bis uniformly cour
teous treatment of the members and his
fair and impartial rulings. Bulla added a
few words of eulogy to the resolution, and
with - Senator Dickinson in the chair it was
adopted with a rising vtke, Dickinson put

Senator Smith on behalf of his fellow
members made the presentation â¢ speech,
and acquitted him with dignity, and
honor. Though notified but a few mo
ments before of I the pleasant ' duty that
was to devolve upon him,' his address was
excellently felicitous and met with the
hearty applause of bis colleagues and
the large audience tbat was - present to
witness the closing scenes. While Smith
was delivering this presentation speech
President Jeter occupied a seat in front
and to the left of the bar of the Senate.
When Smith | concluded Jeter \ responded
in well-chosen and appropriate words. -
President pro tern. Flint was thanked by
resolution lor his courtesy and fairness
while in the chair and the same compli

his services as chairman of the County

DEATH OF ALLEN R. SHAW
A Marin County Pioneer Died
at His Sausalito Home
Yesterday.
Deserted From the United States Man

Excitement
One of the earliest settlers in Marin
County, Allen Rodgers Shaw, died at his
home on the ".North 1 Pacific : Coast J Rail
road's wharf in Sausalito yesterday.
ALLEN R. SHAW.
The death of Mr. Shaw removes a charac
ter who 1 has figured [in I the history of â¢ the"; r I
county of Marin ever since tbe time of the ;
gold excitement in California. ' : //.: ,
It was in 1850 when the United States ,
man-of-war Belfast entered the harbor of i
San Francisco, but when she left port
some time later there was one of ber crew
who did not .. sail *. with her, and . that was ' '
'Allen R. Shaw. '-. "i f " '> â '

gold days fascinated him, and he deserted.
| the' ship. â -' He made his way into Marin
County, which was then a wild country,
with an indifferent' service between San
Francisco and-Sausallto." ' :
He secured a position in the old mill in
Mill Valley, and when tbat historic struc
ture was in operation he u-ed to handle
the lons as they were brought to the mill.
Later be lived "on the va-t Reed ranch, and
then he moved to Sausalito. :.'â/"
His home is built over the water's, and
during the last fifteen days as his life has i
ebbed away he has sat on the landing
overlooking the : bay and watched the
changes as they have taken place. J
The word, of his âdeath .'has been j
passed from mouth to mouth throughout
Marin County, and the little home in
Sausalito was visited 'by many ?of his
pioneer friends who took a parting look at
the "old man" and spoke words of en
couragement to his widow. . ;â :?â¢. â¢ .
i" Mr. Shaw was an American, bom in the
State of .M -line in 1832. and was a charter;
member of the Society of Uni'ed Work
ingmen of Sausalito. He leaves a widow
and two , sons, one of whom is** an en
gineer on one of the Southern Pacific's
trains J plying between Oakland and Ala

The Municipal Reform lea-rue on the "-'

. At a meeting of. the Municipal Keform
League, held on Thursday evening,' the
following resolutions were passed: "
Whereas, It appears from all available In
formation that the Sprint: Valley Water Com-
Fumy Is and for many years has been securing
rom the citizens of San Francisco interest on
a capitalization vastly in excess of the legiti
mate cost of its plant; and whereas his Honor
the Mayor and tne Board of Supervisors of San
Francisco, for the first time in the history of
the City, are engaged in an earnest and well
directed effort to secure Information as to ihe
cost of constructing i and | operating tne water
system of ihe Spring Valley Compan-.*, in order
to fix a water rate that shall be equitable and
fair to the rate-payers of this City and yield a
ju**t and reasonable profit to the stockholders
of the Spring Valley Company;
' Resolved, That the Municipal Reform League
hereby indorses the said action of the Mayor
and the Board of Supervisors of San Fran
cisco, and urges upon al. property-owners and.
water /rate payers of this City that they take
action supporting the Mayor and Supervisors
in their present praiseworthy efforts, efforts
which we believe will result in the fixing of
water rates that shall be as just and fair 'as is
possible without municipal ownership,;. the .
only system which can insure absolute just
ness iv the fixing of water rates, and secure
at : all . times : an abundant and pure supply of
water. P. J. Healy, Secretary.

* NEW YORK, N. V., March 20.â A spe
cial cable dispatch to the Press from Lar
issa, Thessaly, says:
A, careful examination of the Turkish
army, made with special -facilities for ac
curacy, justifies the statement that the
* men are dirty, ragged and ill-fed, and that
they ore demoralized by the * spirit of dis
content which such conditions invariably
create. - Contrary to the general public
â¢ belief they are inferior to the Greeks in
numbers. The one thing which has sus
tained the Moslems throughout, and made
it possible for them to make a showing in
the field and continue their molestations
of Christians, is -that Emperor William of.
Germany has contributed ; to them plenty
of ammunition. This assistance buoys
them up somewhat, as it presupposes aid
in other directions should the actual crisis
demanding it present itself. Â . ....:
The masses in" Macedonia are desirous ;
of Grecian rule and ready to rise when- j
ever the signal is given. The Greeks
have quietly armed 10,000 Macedonians,
who have returned to Turkish territory.
â¢They are not uniformed, but they are
armed and in the mountain passes are
I waiting; for history to ; have the oppor
tunity of repeating itself in another
Thermopylae.
"While .these Macedonians are eager to
strike the blow the Turkish .troops.: on
their way to the iront were much dissatis
fied. The*" religious mania of other years
did not posses them. They were ripe for
midnight butcheries and the looting of
the defenseless, hut they were not desirous
of battled '**â¢?Â»;""-"
It was with difficulty that open insur
rection was suppressed, and troops that
. would have been effective as marauding
bands bad no relish Icr fighting. , :
Under the present conditions a battle
would be a sure walk-over lor; the Greeks.
They are superior in numbers to the
Turks, better drilled and better fed. They
besides have the inspiration' of patriotism
out of which heroes are made. Emperor
"William may send his ammunition to the
Turks, out it takes more than ammunition
to win a battle.
ATHENS, Geeece. March 20.â 1t is
stated here that Admiral Toubatco, com
manding the Italian fleet in the Gulf of
Aria, has summoned the Turks to dis
mount their guns at the entrance of the
gulf in twenty-four hours. The Moslems

against the attitude of Great Britain, Rus
sia, Germany, France, Austria \ and Italy

tion it has assumed, that of : being practi
cally tails to the kites of Russia* and
Germany, , has not excited the sensation
\vhic - i it was expected the appearance of
the pamphet would create. ..'*>''.â
The Conservative newspapers, which are
bound "by party affiliations to support
Lord y Salisbury; comment. at length on
the pamphlet. They point out, losing
sight of the fact that the conditions how
and at the time to which: they refer are
vary different, that Gladstone's Govern
ment took the initiative in the blockade
of Greece in 1886, when that kingdom
I claimeda section of .Macedonia to balance
ft claimed section of Macedonia to balance
th** acquisition of Eastern Roumelia by
Bulgaria, this coercion on the part of the
powers ceasing only upon the submission
of Greece after some desperate | fighting
upon the frontier of Turkey, in which sev
eral hundreds of Greeks were? killed and
hundreds taken "prisoners by the Turks. ;-
The Liberal papers take heart from the
ringing words of their old leader to" attack
the policy of ; -the Government more ( vig
orously than before. They recall that last
year when Lord '" Rosebery was \ leader ,of
the Liberals he declared that everything
that could be done ought to be done to
put an end ;to the detestable . system of
government prevailing in Turkey. ......
The plain statement made yesterday by
the Earl of Kimberley, the present Liberal
leader in the House of Lords, explaining
the speech he had made at the meeting of
the National Liberal '- Federation at Nor
wich shoulu set at rest all doubt concern
ing the present policy of the Liberal
party and the proof that Gladstone in
,11 accord with the Liberal leaders. The
Earl said in effect that;- what he intended
*to convey in his speech was that the Lib
eral party. would - depart from .'the policy
it had'rursued in the past in connection
with -Turkey and would maintain that the
existence of ; the 'Ottoman J empire was a
standing menace to the peace of ' Europe.
Regarding the present situation rep
resentative of the - United -r Associated
Presses has obtained information from an
official source tbat Lord Salisbury, has not
given his consent y. to- a blockading of
Greene. He has declined to*give a definite
decision in the matter until it is seen
wh:it the effect will be of the measures
that have been adopted in reeard to Crete.
The Foreign Office, is confident that de
velopments in the near future will ameli
orate the crisis. y .. '
â . The trend vbfyÃusÃO^ German-Austrian
diplomacy t has been during \ the current
week '' as vigorously in favor of the sever
est repression of Greece jas at any period
of this long- prolonged crisis. v But J for the
opposition of Great Britain^ supported by
France and Italy, a war blockade, not a
pacific blockade, . of all the Greek coast
would have been formed and the Greek
fleet in Cretan and ."Esrean waters might
I have been treated. as the allied fleets dealt
with the Turks at Navarino. \ . ' s J
' The European "concert," always shaky,"
would have collapsed and Great Britain
nave had to face 1 humiliation/ or been
forced to enter upon a European war sin
gle-handed or with one doubtful ally. '
â - The danger of a European war is by no
means yet averted. The Czar appears to
have thrown over Greece and the just de
mands of Greece altogether, and appears
to be willing to allow the Turks ;to use
their full military . strength in crushing
the comparatively feeble army of King
George. *'*'* _ ' *."" '
The- German Emperor, one of whose
aims is. to weaken the Russo-French
entente by playing Russia's game on the
Balkan peninsula, has . both incited and
supported the Czar's : policy. The Aus
trian Government, which opposes any
expansion of Greece in any : direction and
especially toward -J Macedonia, has,
through taking no initiative, sided with
the Kaiser. ' yli
This simmering mess of diplomacy still
gets the name of the European "con
cert." If no rupture occurs, any real
concert obtained will be largely due to
one potent personal influence, that of the
Queen of Ens-land. However the in
firmities ot old age may weigh upon her
Majesty, her intellect remains vigorous,
and her determination to interfere in the
great crisis of England's foreign policy
has been displayed as markedly as ever. â 
The principle that the Queen "'reign?,
but does not govern," has never prevented
her always well-informed opinion having
influence with her Ministers, nor hin
dered her influence being used at Euro
pean courts in moments of international
| peril.
At this juncture her Majesty has been,
* perhaps, the strongest factor at work for
justice to Greece and peace for Europe.
! She has kept in direct personal communi
cation with the German Emperor and in
directly with the Czar. These" communi
cations will never form matter for a blue-
I book, but their drift is known.
The Queen used all her really immense
influence to keep Europe from war, and
continues pleading on behalf of Greece.
The German Emperor sulks - under her
advice, while the Czar is said to be more
cordially responsive.

Ex-Af mister Thurston's Statements Sharply
r Criticized by Legation Members .-"â¢"
, ? ~r a f; Washington, jy '.'-.';? y
.'WASHINGTON, \ D. C., March 20.â
Statements recently made by ex-Minister
Thurston of Hawaii regarding the dangers
which " ho x alleges .Hawaii *has cause to >
dread on account of L the influx of Japan
ese, have aroused some indignation among
the members of the Japanese legation, in
this city. They say Mr. Thurston is mis
taken both in .his facts and his conclu
sions. The Japanese Government .has no
designs upon Hawaii, and there is nothing
in the present or past condition of affairs
in the islands which in the remotest de
gree justifies such an allegation. ;i'
When the Japanese first went to Hawaii
in considerable numbers it wan in compli
ance wi'.n the demand for labor upon the
sugar plantations. They went under the
terms of a convention made only after re
peated requests from the Hawaiian Gov
ernment' and 'entered into somewhat re
luctantly by Japan. ' That X convention -is
still i in 'â force." but 'â â  can :be a brocated upon
due notice by either parly. â  ,-. ,-'; : r?c*'A
â¢yjA little more than a year ago; the Japa
nese Government enacted a law, by the
terms of . which Japanese are permitted to
emigrate to those i countries, - ; and those
countries only, whither their emigration
will not S be ? contrary to > the law of the
country ;of destination. . - . ,v ; -C r W
Several companies have been formed in
Japan for the purpose oi promoting emi
gration under this law not only to Hawaii,
but also, to v ? other conn where emi
grants are in demand. But neither the
Japanese Minister nor any other Japanese
official : has any connection with these
companies, which exclusively private
business I concerns. Nor do these com
' panics promote J; emigration to Hawaii !
except in compliance with the demand for
labor in the islands. y ;:;.--; y v'

the people -whom they assist in sending
abroad and could.not; afford to incur the
heavy penalties which ; the law. would im
pose upon them if they sent people indis
criminately to countries where It here is no
demand for labor. Consequently 99 out
of every -TOO Japanese 5 who go to Hawaii
go there in fulfillment of agreements for
their -employment- upon the plantations
or â  elsewhere \in s ; the islands. Japanese
emigration to 'i Hawaii owes its initiative
to the Hawaiian Government, and owes
its continued - existence to the Hawaiian
planters. The moment their demand for
labor ceases Japanese emigration will end
also.' 'â -"'-'.'â â '" :-'â /â ''â  _ â¢â -:: r :':'-' .â â 'â¢'.'â â 'â 'â â â '- 'â â

of the Japanese : legation to-day, "knows
this and he must know also that without
this --'class of 1 docile, intelligent labor," or
some adequate substitute for it, the chief
source of Hawaiian wealth, the sugar in
dustry, would v be -fatally^crippled.yyThei
officials of I tbe Japanese legation cannot
understand why Mr. Thurston y should
ignore this unless he. believes tt is indis

ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 20.â -The warn
ing sent out by the Government signal
service yesterday that tne Mississippi
River and all its tributaries would con
tinue to rise has been fulfilled to the let
ter. Communication with tbe flooded
section has been difficult, but 'dispatches
are received from widely separated pom's
showing that all have Buffered alike. It
is estimated that a section of country with
an area equal to that of the State of Mis
souri is now under water and that the
worst is not over. Advices from Cairo,
Paducah, Memphis and Helena show that
the region beg lining north of New
Madrid, Mo., west to and including the
valleys of the St. Francis, the White and
the Arkansas rivers, in Arkansas, east in
Kentucky and Tennessee, ol the valleys of
the Tennessee, the Cache, the Obion and
the Yazoo rivers and south to the Red,
River are under water. The intervening â 
ranges of hills and highlands are the only
places of refuge. The dispatches received
here tell but one storyâ livestock drowned
and a country desolate.
At Cairo, 111., to-day the river reached
50.9 feet and rising slowly, which is but
one foot short of the high record of 18S3.
All the country south of there to Mem
phis is submerged. A relief steamer from
the flats below Birds Point brought in
four families. It is reported that a flat
boat containing a number of people was
sunk at Island No. 10.
Bright sunshine this afternoon revived
the hopes of the people about Cairo.
About Nashville the situation is bad and
rain is threatening. The basements of
business houses on Front street and the
lower end of .Broad street are lull of
"water and thousands of dollars' worth of
goods are irreparably damaged. Much of
this damage could have been prevented by
timely; removals if the warnings of the
Weather Bureau had been heeded.
In the residence portion of tbe Nash
ville lowlands many people continued to
occupy their houses until this morning,
but they are now moving out in boats.
No deaths by drowning are reported.
The Memphis Relief Association has
five boats at work. These boats go to
points that are some twenty miles from
streams navigable in ordinary stages of
water. unanimous opinion of St. Louis
river men is that conditions must become j
worse before there can be permanent relief.
DES MOINES, lowa, March 20.â The
Dcs Moines River rose four feet at this
poi'it from last evening to noon to-day,
and is now about stationary. It is four-,
teen feet above normal, ana the situation
is much worse than at any previous time.
During the forenoon Mayor McVicker was
called upon by a delegation from the north
part of town and asked for aid. The
sudden rise in the morning had flooded
many houses, and people were taken out
in boats. Crocker Wood Park is under
water, and great damage has been done to
buildings, waits, boatbou c es and her im
provements. Water has backed into the
sewers, and cellars in the lower part of the
City are flooded.
The great gorge in the lowa River at
lowa Fails went out this afternoon, and
aside from the damage to the mill and
dam at Aldcn, no damage was done.
Onawa dispatches say that the Little Sioux
is out of its banks there, in places four
miles wide, and is still rising fast. .At
Cherokee the situation is worse than ever
before.* The Little Sioux has flooded the
lower part of the town and hundreds of
people are driven from their homes. The
town is cut off irom communication with
the outside world by rail." From Cherokee
to Sioux City, the Illinois Central is
swamped, bridges are out and grades
washed away in several places. The only,
encouraging feature of the situation is
that the weather Is much colder to-night
and the snow in the north part of the
State has ceased melting. The rain that
was threatened * yesterday seems to be
averted for the present.
The Das Moines is rising fast at 11
o'clock to-night, and it is just reported
that the water has invaded the power
house of the City Railway, and the fire
under part of the boilers has , been
quenched by it. There is another battery
of boilers a few inches higher and if it is
reached, as is now expected, it will be im
possible to produce power and the entire
city has a good chance to be without
streetcar service to-morrow. The power
house is a new one, on the east side of the
river.
SIOUX CITY, lowa, March 20âRe
ports of damage by floods are coming in
to-night from towns all over the territory
about Sioux City. The Big and Little
Sioux, Vermilion, Jim Rock and Elkhorn
rivers are a few among the more import
ant streams which are giving trouble.
Bridges are nearly all gone on all of them,
towns on their banks are inundated and
thousands of acres Of farm lands are under
water.
No lives are reported lost, but damage
to buildings, grain and livestock will oe
enormous. Railroad traffic is about at a
standstill.
OMAHA, Nebb., March 20.â The gen
eral thaw of the past ween has started the
ice in the Logan and Elkhorn rivers and
towns along their banks have been threat
ened with floods, but only two of any, im
portance have, been seriously damaged.
Pending, on the Logan River, is to-night
partly ' submerged, and 1 Norwalk, :;* the
sugar-beet town, is in several feet of water.
While the Missouri River is very high,
the danger point-has! not been reached.'
Indian Creek, which runs through the
heart of ! the city of Council Bluffs, rose
suddenly yesterday and flooJed some of
the streets.
- At Norfolk thousands of dollars worth
of damage lias been done.: The Elkhorn
overflowed its bank* last night, and First,
Second and Third streets are rivers only
passable by boats. All the business por
tion of the city is un-*.er from three to six
feet of water.-* The newspaper, presses in
the city are under four feet of water and
publication ;is suspended. The i Oxnard
Hotel, one of the largest in the city, la

by probably 200 families, overflowed and
the people were forced , to . flee = for their
lives to the hills.
SHEBOYGAN, Wis.. March 20.âPor
tions of thi** city are , flooded to a depth of

moorings have broke loose. The Moore
crashed into y the Eighth-street bridge,
smashing tbe north abutment, and then
swung clear around, striking the other
abutment and damaging it. then passed
out toward the lake." The other boats fol
lowed the Moore, wrecking themselves as
well as docks and other vessels tied at the
docks. Great damage has been done.
Three other vessels were damaged.

WORK OF A WEEK
IN EXTRA SESSION
House } Passes Appropriation
Bills Carrying Over J
$70,000,000.
Diogley's Tariff Measure Re
ported and Order of , Discus
sion Adopted.
Members L*3ok Out for Their Mileag\
, end Altogether Quite a Rec
ore Is MaiÂ©, y .
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.â
first week of the extraordinary session of
the Fifty-fifth Congress closed with to-'
night's session of the House of Represen
tatives. The record is extraordinary. The
tariff bill has been reported and an order
regulating its' discussion adopted. Four
appropriation bills which failed to become
laws in the Fifity-fourth Congress, neces
sary for the prosecution of important
parts of the public service, carrying a
total of over $70,000,000. have been passed,
with the exception of one paragraph, as
they were finally agreed upon by the last
Hou-e. Two of these, the agricultural
and Indian, were considered and deposed
of to-day. The former, appropriating
$3,182,950, was"' passed, as had been ,the
sundry civil and general deficiency bills
yesterday, without charge.
The time allowed for debate on these bills
permitted Champ Clark (D.) of Missouri to
make a, characteristic speech upon the
subject of rules. He withdrew all previ
ous criticisms of the Senate and thanked
God that it still remained a deliberative
assembly. The action of the House yes
terday and to-day he termed the most
amazing- and astounding performances
ever witnessed on the continent.
One feature of the Indian bill provoked
much opposition and was practically
stricken out by unanimous consent before
the bill parsed. This was the paragraph
opening the gilsonite or asphalt lands in
the TJncompahgre reservation, Utah, to
entry under the mineral laws, which the
Senate bad added to the bill.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois urged the pass
age of this bill as it stood.
Sherman asked unanimous con-tent to
strike out the paragraph opening the gil
soDite lands on the Uncumpahgre reser
vation in Utah to entry under the mineral
laws and that Bartholdt (R.) of Missouri,
who had previously objected, be permitted
to make a statement.
v Permission was ; given and . Bartholdt
characterized it as criminal neglect or a
crime that these lands, which not a bird
or beast could live on, had net been here-"
tofore opened to civilization. The last
Congress bad passed a bill containing a
similar provision, the Democratic Presi
dent had signed it, and Bartholdt ex
pressed the opinion that the Secretary of
the Interior should be impeached for . his
failure to carry out the law. The opening
of the gilsonite mines would give employ
ment to many thousands of workingmen."
Something had been said, Bartholdt
continued, about private enterprise.
'â¢What," he asked, "would be the rspect
and condition of the country were it not
for private enterprise and private invest
ment?"
It was true, he said, that some St. Louis
gentlemen are working a mine in the
neighborhood of the reservation, but all
they wanted, be assured the House,' was
that the reservation might be opened, so
that a railroad could be built to their
property, and thus enable them to get
into competition with the corporation con
trolling the Southern product. :
Bartholdt withdrew bis objection, the
paragraph was stricken out and ' the â¢ bill
passed.
In the course of discussion on a resolu
tion by : Cannon to make the appropria
tion for mileage, etc." immediately avail
able, 'Holman objected, declaring that it
was the intention of the resolution to pay
double mileage for the extra session as
well as for the regular session.
Grout (R.) of Vermont asked Holman if
he had taken the mileage voted by the
Fifty-third Congress for each of its three
sessions. - ' .-:',-â "-â ;â -' 'â 
Holman's reply could only bs heard a
few feet. Being asked to repeat it, Hol
man, raising his voice, said: "The gen
tleman from Indiana declines to answer
the impertlnentquestion of tbegentiemau
from Vermont.'.' [Great laughter.]
" Cannon responded to Holman. He said
that under tne law members 'of Congress
.were entitled to mileage for every regular
session of Congress, and being so entitled
it was the best thing, the most manly, to
go up and take it. [Applause.]
The joint resolution was passedâ l 92 to
30. Its opponents were not able to muster
votes enough to secure the ayes and noes.
Another joint resolution was offered by
Cannon and . agreed to, making " imme- ,
diately available the appropriation for the
payment of the session employes of Con
gress. :â  â ..'.':â¢'>.'";..-' ... -

a Report.
Baron yon Gutschmidt, the German
Minister to Japan, arrived here yesterday
on the steamer Coptic, on bis way home
to Berlin. He has been summoned to
return and in this .connection a curious
story comes to the surface. According to
it there is discomfiture In store for the
German nobleman. ,-'''-y' :- :||,v :
Some time since, as will be recalled, one
Lieutenant Zachland of the German army,
who had been for several months in dif
ferent parts of the Orient, arrived here,
and gave out that the gentleman who re
presented his country at the court of the
Mikado was incompetent to fill the place,
in that he was : not' diplomatic. Besides
this be alleged that the Baron was incor
rect in some of his reports to his home
Government.
For instance, as one of the things set
forth, Lieutenant Zachland claimed that
the Baron's ' report on tbe cause of the
trouble in Korea would not pass muster,
for be himself had been there and knew
all about it. What grieved Zachland the
most, however, was the incivility of the
Embassador to Japan. He thought he
could be improved upon, and therefore he
wrote a full account of his alleged mis
doings â¢â  and sad be would forward the
complaint to his Government.
It is believed .that, this is what is now
causing yon Gutichmid t to cross two oceans
to get to the capital of his country. The
Baron is now at the Palace. He has been
expected for some time.

Fight for the Conciliation of

LONDON, Esq., March 20.â The fight
for . conciliation ' of the Irish parties on
financial reforms proceeds: in merry fac
tion > fashion. f. When "MryHealy, at the
first conference of last week, insisted upon
asserting the existence of a Healyite
parly as a separate entity and declared its
independence by the appointment of " a
separate ' secretary, the remotest hope of a
conciliation of Unionists and Nationalists
disappeared. The Healyites, having got
their secretary in (T. B. Curren), the Dii
lonites got theirs (Mr. Abrahams), â¢ and
the Redmondites, Patrick Brick. As
a consequence Unionist Conservatives had
to appoint one also, in Horace Piunkett.
v These four gentlemen set themselves to
compose the sort of non-committal resolu
tion which came before the second confer
ence on . Friday, the j acceptance of which
was due to its negative qualities. But out
of twenty-one Conservative "Unionist mem
bers fifteen refuse to have any fellowship
with those l workers of iniquity, the Home
Rulers, even if the financial prosperity of
their country be concerned.
Tbe ardent Orange patriot, William
Johnson, has called the coalition a "con
fused conglomeration,'' and certainly it is
a conglomeration which shows no signs of
complete fusion. If the four Unionists
Colonel Saunaerson. Mr. Lecky, Horace
Plunkett and Mr. ; Carson â who partici-
pated in the conference are sincere in
wishing harmonious action with the Na
tionalists on this financial question it can
be secured. y But their sincerity is abund
antly doubted. The, sub-committee, con
sisting of Colonel Saundersoni Mr. Lecky, ;
Mr. Healy and J. J. Clancy, and on which
Mr. Dillon declined to serve, was from the
first looked upon by the Dillonites with
a distrust that fuitlier proceedings have
confirmed.
A story is going the rounds here that
part of the Prince cf Wales' business in
the south of France is closely connected
with the future of a young lady in whom
he is much interested." Her mother was
an American lady who married a .Nea
politan Duke and has been dead for some
yearÂ». She was a widow at her death, and
at her request the Prince largely under
took the care of her daughter. There
have been, it is said, difficulties about her
marriage, *as the lady, like her late
mother, has a decided will of her own.
Now all seems settled, and a matcb with a
French nobleman, young and highly es
teemed, is being arranged. -,-. -â â {.. â  , â .â 3i
The practice of the Oxford and Cam
bridge crews on the Thames so far and
their t- st trials over the actual course

body admires the neatness and swing of
the Cambridge crew. They are faster than
last year. 'The Oxford eight, however, are
rather heavier and pull every ounce of
their weight.
y There are rumors of a combination
among West End theatrical managers
against the growing rivalry and popular
ity of the new suburban houses.. The lat
ter are now as handsome and commodious
as the more fashionable and batter known
ones and the ; performances are quite as
good. Leading actors like : * Sir Henry
Irving and 'Mr. Tree were very fond of
presiding at the foundation-stone laying
of these new rivals and made speeches at
the time declaring that the suburban
bouses were educating the public to
become playgoers. Tney now find that
the new playgoers prefer \to wait the ar
rival of West End successes in their midst
rather than spend time and money r. trav
eling to "town." , :y y
The weekly journalism of London is un
dergoing some transformation. The Na
tional Observer, started seven years ago,
is to be amalgamated with the British Re
view, a "* comparatively new Conservative
weekly. The National Observer, once the
Scotch Observer, was the most brilliant
I roduction of its Kind while under the ed
itorship of W. E. Henley. J Latterly, un
der J. Vincent, it has been more decorous
and respectable. There is also to be an
o her entirely new weekly of independent'
and conservative ".'â¢, views : and : "literary"
tone. The retort ; that Aided Beit bad

be unfounded. â¢

Penalty.

Maintain an Air of
Bravado.
. Final and Tricky Appeal to the Guv*

â¢f â â . ' *
. * NEWPORT, Ky., March 20.â Scott Jack
Â»on and Alonzo Walling were hanged to
â¢â  day. The once promising lives of the
young dental students paid the penalty
to-day on the gallows for the murder of
* the pretty country girl,' Pearl Bryan, of
Greencastle, Ind. The scene was at Fort
' Thomas, and the date February 1. 1895.
The victim was decapitated to prevent
'identification, and the head has never
been located. The arrests, trials, "con
' fessions" and general progress to the
\ -awful sequel of to-day have been largely
spectacular, especially the closing hours
of the tragedy this morning in Newport.
.. Nearly all the forenoon Walling's fate
seemed swaying in the balance, and the
.5000 people, t with plentiful sprinkling of
' richly uniformed militia acting as guards,
*â¢ wailed with gieat interest at highest ten
sion the springing of the fatal trap or the
announcement' of the clemency granted
* by- Governor Bradley. Walling went to
'â¢ * sleep at 1 o'clock this morning, and slum
. bered un brokenly until 6 o'clock. Jack
son slept a little. From that early hour
: â¢ until the final announcement that both
â¢ must hang at 11:30 the prisoners sat at
the windows of the jail, facing the crowded
courthouse yard with every appearance of
unconcern. On the gallows neither was
deserted by the bravado that bas marked
their conduct ever since they first posed
before the public in the celebrated tragedy.
At 11:40 the double trap was spruug and
* tney swung in midair twenty minutes be
fore the horrible work of strangling was
complete. Â«â "
The time originally set was , 7 o'clock,
* but almost as the start was made for the
gallows Jackson . made another "confes
sion" in which he said Walling was not
euilty of "willful murder."
,i .Again the Governor was appealed to at
Frankfort by wire, Jackson himself tele-
I graphing: "Walling is not guilty ol this
crifrfe, but I am." yy.yj
* Finally Governor Bradley after patient
investigation of Jackson's tardy attempt
to save his comrade, including a long
distance telephone consultation with
Judge Helm, tne trial Judge, and the at
torneys in' the case, sealed the doom of
both by declaring against further delay.
Jackson is said to have left still another
written confession, to be published or not J
as his friends may see fit. The one of j
Â« s .(Thursday, diabolically trying to snift a J
- â¢,-.fjji**Vbf--tuff f crime on an innocent man, i
â  * both Jackson and Walling acknowledged
this morning to be false.
', As there was objection to the receiving
..of. the body, of Jackson for burial in the
Greencastle Cemetery it was shipped this
evening over the Big Four to his former
* home in Maine. Walline's body was
taken to Hamilton, Ohio, by his family
lor burial. f.y ';
STORK OF THE CRIME.
Jackson and Walling Decapitated the <
Body of Their Victim.
â¢ CINCINNATI,. Ohio, March 20;â On
Saturday : morning, February 1, 1896, the
headless body of a young woman was
found on the farm of John B. Lock, near
the end of the Fort Thomas eleclric-car
line, south of Newport, Ky. No marks of
id*entitii.ation could be discovered, and no
cards, letters or anything calculated to
solve the mystery couid be found. The
body was taken to an undertaker's in
Newport and a further .'examination
showed that the dead woman's shoes
were stamped "Lewis & Hays, Green
castle, Ind." " v ' t ,**
With this clew the detectives went to
work, with the result that the corpse was
identified as Miss Pearl Bryan, aged 22,
daughter of Alexander. Bryan, a well-to
do farmer,, living half a mile south of
Greencastle^
On January 27 Pearl Bryan left her
home ostensibly to visit friends in Indian
apolis,' but instead came direct to this
city to meet Scott Jackson, a student at
the Ohio College of Dental Surgery.
Jackson failed to keep his appointment
with the' girl, and after wandering about
the city she went ; to the Indiana House
and registered under an assumed name.
The next day Jackson-called at the hotel
to see her. On Wednesday. January 29,
she left the Indiana House with Jackson
and a fellow-student named Alonzo Wall
ing, and from that day until her body was
found at Fort Thomas -nothing is posi
tively known as, to the movements of the
trio. 'â ..-." - . '.--â â¢'â â '
. A post mortem examination of the
corpse revealed the fact. that the dead girl
was about to become a mother. Jackson
and Walling were arrested at their board
.ing-house on Weft Ninth ; street and
charged with the murder. At .the pre
liminary* examination of the prisoners
each accused the other, of having killed
the girl. Jackson admitted that he was
acquainted with Pearl Bryan, but denied
any knowledge of the murder. â  Walling
said he did not know her.
The students were taken to the under
taker's, where the headless body was ex
hibited. In the presence of the father and
sister of the ; murdered girl the Chief of
Police asked Walling; if he recognized the
corpse. He replied in a clear, voice that it
was Pearl Bryan. , JT i "
The same question was asked Jackson,
who said that it must be Pearl Bryan, be
cause he saw; her relatives in the room.
Turning to Walling the Chief said : y
/.-Walling, did you kill this woman? ..
â¢'I did not."
-Who did then?"
"I have eVery" reason to believe that :
from what Jackson told me he d-d. ' â ,y
Then tun-in-: to the other prisoner. :,-, : j
"Jackson, did you murder this girl 7
"I did not, sir." â ',
-Can you look upon: this corpse and
deny that you committed the crime? â _â 
"lean and I do most emphatically,
replied Jackson, looking at the corpse as
he spoke. "' .*>
"Who did kill her?" â¢* iâ ' ; -
â¢â¢I have every, reason to ;â  believe :â¢ tbat
Walling did." y ,'7/ ' . * ;Â£^~Â«
Mrs. Stanley, a' sister of Pearl Bryan,
â olMded with Jackson to telpher where
the head was put, but Jackson looked at
her and said calmly and gravely, "Mrs.
Stanley, I do not know." * 'Â
'; /At the Coroner's inquest a verdict was
rendered that cocaine had been adminis
tered "and that Pearl Bryan -had been de
capitated while she was still alive;, that
she was seen in company with Scott Jack
son and Alonzo Walling getting into a
cab at the corner of Plum and George
streets, in Cincinnati, and that, she came
to her death on the premises of John 8. .
Lock, near Fort Thomas. Campbell' Coun- I
ty. Ky. . .
Jackson's trial opened April 21. It
lasted until May 14. The testimony of j
i George H. Jackson, the colored cabman, |
who said he drove the party to Fort j
Thomas, was collateral. The main evi
dence was in reference to the relations of J
Jackson and Pearl Bryan, and the mcdi- |
cal testimony as to whether the girl had
been decapitated before, or .after death
and whether it was in Kentucky or Ohio.
The State had 113 witnesses and the de
fense 83. ''^))W ')â 'â ':) ;
It is generally regarded that two items
that told most heavily,, against Jackson
were his admission that he had been inti
mate with Pearl Bryan and the proof that
two of bis witnesses were perjurers.
Scott Jackson took the stand in his own
behalf. He was not ccoss-examined. His
story was not shaken nor was it believed.
He took the death verdict calmly.
The Walling trial began May 26, and it
ended June IS. , The evidence la his case i
was practically the same as against Jack
son. .The most damaging feature in the
case against Walling probably was his ad
mission tbat he knew Scott Jackson was
going to kill the girl and would not warn
her of impending dancer. In this trial
the State examined sixty-two witnesses,
the defense forty.
Not once in all the hundred severe ex
aminations to which Jackson and Walling
have been subjected have they blundered
or revealed anything. They* have been
self-poscessed, keenly intelligent and cold
blooded through it all.
The petition for a rehearing of the case
of Jackson and Walling was overruled by
the Kentucky Court of "Appeals, and the
day of execution was fixed for March 20,
1597. On March 6 Walling made a formal
appeal to Governor Bradley for clemency.
The condemned man reviewed his case in
brief, but the letter contained nothing
more than developed at the trial.
On March 10 Hon. 15. J. Crawford, at
torney for Scott Jackson, and Colonel
George Washington, counsel for Walling,
made formal application for executive
clemency on behalf of the prisoners.
These appeals to the Governor of Ken
tucky were the last legal steps taken by
! the defendants' attorneys to avert the
doom of March 20.
Walling also made another appeal to
the Governor, claiming that he was inno
cent of any crime.
Scott Jackson was 27 years old, the only
son of Mrs. John Jackson, a highly re
spected widow, of Greencastle. Ind. His
sister is married to Dr. Edwin Post, pro
fessor of Latin in De Pauw University,
Indiana. Alonzo Walling was 20 years
old, son of Mrs. Sarah Walling of lord,
Ohio. '" ' V

DENVER, Col., March 20.â E. Curtis of

route home from Carson City. He had
ridden there in as much state as if he were
the owner of a private car. y All ; it cost ]
him was tho price of a; single j round-' j â¢
trip ticket. r On his way there i the rail- j '
roads tried to bluff him out by asking him
to change to another car that was going ]
in the same general direction! but Curtis |
said that he had been solicited ; to buy a j
ticket in a through car and he had con- j
sented; '..lf the railroads, could not get I
any more passengers from New Orleans it i
was not his fault, and he would hold them I
to the ntrict letter of his contract.
At Denver they -told - him that the
wheels were out of order, but Curtis said
he was something of a judge of wheels
himself "and wanted to have the fact
demonstrated. "â "''; >'rj ;y â .-'.;â¢ "â¢;â¢-â ;-.;

FORENSIC EFFORT
IN THE REICHSTAG
Leaders Grow : Eloquent on j
the. Extra Naval
Credits.
; Notwithstanding the Array of
Royalty and Gold Lacs the
Demands Are Rejected.
Emperor William Will Go V.*ry Slow -
in Appealing to the Whole
Nation.
BERLIN, Germany. March 20.âAl
though the Reichstag's rejection of the
Government's demands for extra naval
credits for the construction of new cruis
ers and a number of torpedo-boats': has
been a certainty since tbe declaration of
Dr. Lieber, the leader of tbe Centrist
party, in the chamber on Thursday, that
the Center would adhere to the decision of
the Budget Committee in opposition to I
the demands, the debate which began on
Thursday and culminated in to-day's
session have been followed with intense
interest. -
The chamber was packed with Deputies
showing the largest attendance of the ses
sion, and the diplomatic and other gal
leries were crowded with spectators.
' Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of the
Emperor and vice-admiral commanding
the second division of the German fleet
at Kiel, sat in the royal box. He wore the
full uniform of his rank and especial at
tention was directed to him by the sug
gestion that his presence under the cir
cumstances might be designed to influ
ence the decision of the house in favor of
the demands, at least in a greater measure
than they were finally conceded, for
Prince Henry is very popular and de
servedly so.
Among the other distinguished person
ages present were Admiral Knorr, com
mander-in-chief of the German navy, and
Baron Senden Bibrau, the chief of the
Emperor's Naval Cabinet, each with a
suite of officers in full uniform, and sev
, eral Ministers.
The discussion throughout' the 'debate
on the credits was of a very lively charac
ter, the ministerial and opposition speak
ers alike displaying their best; oratory.
Dr. Verbennigsen, the old-time National
Liberal leader, who has been very seldom
heard since he became so advanced in
age, showed much of the fire of former
days, in his. delivery of an eloquent and
vigorous appeal to the House to support
the grants.
The attack made upon the military and
naval policy of the Government by Herr
yon Vollmar, the Socialist orator, and the
speech of Herr Richter, the Radical
leader, in opposition to the credits, were
splendid forensic efforts, and the response
of Freiiierr Marschall yon Bieberstein,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, in support of
tne demands,': was a skillful presentation
of the 'necessity for the credits,- which
heightened his â â â  exalted reputation as a
parliamentary pleader.
After the votes on the credits, wh eh re
sulted in sustaining the decision of the
Budget Committee in refusing the grants
for building two new cruisers and a num
ber of torpedo-boats, and to grant credits
for the construction of one new iron
clad, there were rumors in the lobbies,
which took definite form, of a Ministerial,
crisis. These rumors had it that the
Kaiser had determined not only to trans
form the Ministry, with some new blood
in it, but to dissolve tbe Reichstag; but
how much truth there is in the reports
. cannot now be learned.'
The Vossische Zeitung, in its issue of
last evening, referred to a story which is
now current that the Emperor bad in
formed Baron yon Stumm, who, in turn,
had communicated it to the party lead- |
ers, that if the vote of the Reichstag upon j
the naval credits was hostile to the Gov
ernment he would send both the! Minis-, 1
ters and the Reichstag . adrift. In the
Ministerial circles, however, it is held
that an immediate change of the Mm- j
istry or an appeal to the country is equally j
, improbable. â '""â¢â , '..,. Â
As. a matter of fact there is no good I
reason given upon any side for the over- j
turning of the Government, every member
of which has supported the Emperor in j
his naval policy. In regard to the dis
solution Of 'the' Reichstag and an appeal i
. to the country, old argument "coine's in'
that at the present juncture the country
is certain to return a Reichstag a great
veal more. hostile to an increase of the.
strength- of the navy than the sitting body.
Whatever developments may be im
pending, however, the Emperor will not'
be likely to act hastily. Tne result of the
vote on the credits is not a surprise to'
him and for many reasons, international,
internal and external, he will ta&e lime
to consider before taking any action.
The celebration of the centenary of
Kaiser *Wi>helm I, which will begin on
Monday, March 22, distracts the attention
of the public from the political situation.
The Berlin fete in connection with the
celebration began on Thursday last with
a concert organized by the merchants of
the city, at which the Emperor was pres
ent. Last evening a banquet was given
by the leading representatives of trade
and industry and a kbmmers was given
by the mem of the Academy of Arts',
the Royal School of Art and the High
School of Music. Ti-day, the exhibition
of Kaiser Wiihelm I souvenirs was opened,
from which mere was a procession of
carriages containing representatives of
the university; and technical' schools to
ihe mausoleum at Kaiser Park, where th 6
* tomb was covered with flowers.
The imperial lamilywill go to the mau
soleum on Monday, s and after that ,the
Kaiser .William I monument will, be un
veiled. Hosts of visitors from the coun
try are beginning to arrive and everything
presages a grand celebration of the old
Emperor's hundredth brthday.
A story is published in some of the . Ber
lin newspapers that the Emneror ignored
United Slates Embassador TJhl on the oc
casion of the last ball at the Royal Opera
house, and that he also neglected to speak
to Mrs. "Uhl. The: origin ;of the story is
not Known, but the statement has not
â¢ even a suspicion of truth. . The fact is that
the Emperor warmly shook Mr. Uhl by
the hand and held a pleasant conversa
tion with him and also paid his compli
ments to * Mrs. Uhl in tbe Embassador's
â  box, chatting pleasantly with her and the
â¢ other ladies of the party. * : : , v
IT RUNS ITSELF.
: The Marvelous Machine Invented by a
Maine Man.
- An engine which supplies its own power,
which will turn the wheels of industry
without the burning an ounce of fuel or
the cost of one penny for its work, ma
chine which wiil run as long as its parts
will stay together, and which the longer it
runs the more powerful it; become? â tbat
is what William A. Ropr of Portland, Me.,
claim.-- to have discovered and what hun
dreds of bright men in /New England say
they know lie can do. Rohr does not
claim to have solved the problem of ; per*
pelual motion, but if his machine does
what he says it has done and will do
again he has come as near to the solution
of that vast problem as any man ever will.
About a year a>jo. : says > the Boston
Herald, the inventor interested some of
Portland's business men in his machine,
and, in return for | a partial interest in it,
they agreed to give him money enough to
build a larger model. These gentlemen
thoroughly investigated the machine be
fore they put their money into it. With
skilled mechanics and experts they visited
Rohr's home at' Long Island, and not only
saw his machine run, but took it all apart
and studied the principles on which it de
pends. They kept a man at Rohr's house
for four days and four nights," and during
all of this time the machine continued to
run without interruption. â : yy *' lo' :
Rohr's machine depends on compressed
air combined with some simple mechani
cal contrivance for its power. A large
iron air tank about 12 feet long, 4 feet
high and 3 feet wide is the most important
part of the machine. In this is placed a
cylinder twenty inches in diameter, the
barrel of an ordinary air-pump. The
pump forces air,. sucked in from without
the tank, into the tank itself. The piston
rod of this pump is attached to the crank
shaft of two large 1200-pound fly wheels
above. There is also a large cog wheel on
this shaft geared into a larger cog wheel,
which is supported by a -second shaft
directly in the rear of the first one.
I A large sprocket wheel and chain, simi
lar to that seen on an ordinary bicycle,
connects the second shaft, with its fly
wheels and large cog wheel, to a small
compressed-air engine. Now, when the
big 120-pound fly wheels connected with
the piston rod ot the air pump are put in
motion , by some outside .force, the air
pump forces air into" the; bit; iron tank,
and this air is used to run the auxiliary
compressed-air engine. The â  momentum
of the big fly wheels the piston rod
crank shaft "brings ;.; the ; piston rod up
again for another impulse, and the auxil
iary compressed-air engine, by the series
of sprocket wheels, chains 'and . gearing,
aive- the 1200-pound fly wheels a shove
around, and down goes the piston into
the air pump again, compressing more
air and furnishing more power with which
to run the machine. '.-â â 'â¢'â  ... 'â  ;y
The air pump furnishes just three times
more air than is necessary to run the
auxiliary compressed-air engine, and thus
the machine is constantly laying up
power with which to run. ; V"'-" '
HOPE FOR THE
OAKLAND HOME
End of an Insurance Tangle
Has Been Nearly
Reached.
The Assistant Secretary, Who
Has Been in Charge, Makes
a Report. . ,
t
After Toiling Twenty-Eight Months
He Has Almost Brought About
a Final Settlement.
The affairs of the defunct Oakland j
Home Insurance Company,- which in 1894
went into the hands of the assistant secre
j tary of the company, Oscar P. Sites, for
| liquidation, have practically, been .wound
j up. At a meeting of tbe board of direct
ors, which was held yesterday, a report
: was submitted which shows to the very
large number of persons in Oakland and
San Francisco who were concerned in the
operation of the company much that is of
interest. '^mmmm^ v y *
. This report was submitted by Mr. Sites.
It appears therefrom that on September
1, 1894, when a report was furnished by R.
B. S. York, the books of the company
showed an apparent excess of assets above
liabilities of $14, 000 or more. "But," says
Mr. Sites in his report just submitted, "a
most critical and exhaustive analysis dis
closed the fact' that a large amount of
dead and worthless matter bad been
figured among the assets, and, from in
sufficient data, the stated liabilities proved
to be incorrect also. -.'â¢â¢ Â»."â¢â¢_â¢" )â  ' ' 'â¢â¢â  '
"In other words items of \ commissions,
j cancellations, etc., with-' which sundry
: .agencies should have been credited, and
! the amount of hopelessly bad accounts
! reduced the assets by $44,471 64. while the
| liabilities were swelled oy unreported
I loss and other claim-, in amount
$4465 15. This left an indebtedness of
$143,00398. with assets of only $108,447 48
lo pay it; a deficit of $34,556 50 to contend
with, instead of a surplus." ' â¢
*..- Tnis was not all, for. there were forty
* seven lawsuits over contested losses and a
large percentage of assets and liabilities
also was scattered through nineteen
_ States. During the past eighteen months
seven suits have been brought against
stockholders under the individual liabil
ity law, all of which have been disposed of.
During twenty-eight months, the period
in which Mr. Sites has been winding up
tho affairs of the company, cash bas been
received to the total of $120,295 90. The
disbursements - during the same f period
have amounted to $120,23176, the largest
two items being bills payable, $81,901 40,
and- losses, $17,365 07. This left a balance
On hand January 1, 1897, of just $44 14. y
"One great hardship to contend with,"
reported Mr. Sites, "in the; settlement of
the company's business was tbe manifest
carelessness with which many of the im
portant accounts bad- been handled
through the ' books iof both the Western
department a:d the home * office. It was
a most uihicuit matter to substantiate
some of our claims, and many valuable
items had tecorne lost and sunk out of
sight through gross negligence."
The following facts in the; statement:
give a clear idea to all concerned of tne ex
act situation of the affairs of the corpora
tion January 1, 1897, since when tbere
has" been no material change. The lia
bilities January 1, 1897. amounted to
$7609 93, and to meet these there were the
following items: Cash on hand, $44 14;
premium notes, $2076 11; warrants, $31;
bills receivable, $1127 58; - equity in real
estate, making a total of $5333 40". yOf the
liabilities Mr. Sites reported that $1538 08
are good valid claims. The balance : is
composed largely of losses still in litiga
tion, and is an uncertain ' factor that may
be largely if not wholly left out. -
There is one interesting fact connect
ed with, the settlement of the company's
affairs which was not mentioned in the
assistant secretary's statement, but which
is mentioned by one of the directors. This
is that Mr.' Sites has drawn from the cash
received only $2470, while he was entitled
t0 53500. ' There has- been saved in actual
cash by the action of the assistant secre
tary enough to more than pay every dol
lar of expense ; excepting .*â  interest Â£ and
taxes, and enough to pay $â¢'OOO on account
of the last two items also. The actual to
tal saving, to the v company amounts to,
$41,732 97. 'â 'â :--:'â :->- â  '.â â a:- ;,mm
< f There,' is ; an : indebtedness of $12,294 30,'
which is secured by hypothecations of real
estate not : iv the name of the company,
and consequently these amounts were
deducted from both the assets and the lia
bilities in making up the statement.

The big indoor bicycle tournament
opened last 'evening '(at the Mechanics'
Pavilion to an immense audience. There
is no question but what good cycle-racing
has a hold on the sport-loving public of
this City, and the crowds which attended'
the meet last night had ho reason to com
plain of the quality of the sport furnished.
There were champions from all climes,;
some of tbem world's champions at that,
and they put a vim and dash into the run
ning that was very enthusing.
Mayor Phelan, it had been announcad,
would start the races, but did not appear
until the middle of the evening, having
bad to attend a meeting in aid of tbe
Cubans. When be did come and attempted
to start a race the pistol given him would
not work, but the Mayor, nothing daunted,
used a police whistle, which answered the
purpose. *-/-'/;
The track on which the events were run
is an eight-lap board affair, banked very
high on the turns, and the experiences
of last night proved' it to .be not only per
fectly safe, but very fast. Mile after mile
was negotiated on it at a 2:10 gait, and in
a day or two when the men are more
accustomed to it some of the cracks claim
they will cut that time to two minutes
flat. ' \\ * 'â /â¢"â  ' -' "'' '" ;â  T~' ; ','-

' .The management was fortunate in engag

among men prominent in cycling circles
here. Mayor Pnelan and Robert C. Len

one of the most important and difficult to
fill at a cycle meet," was efficiently han
dled by Senator George E. Dixon.
.The five-mile invitation professional race
was the. star event of the evening's lone
and highly interesting programme, and
brought out some remarkable rider*. In'
the first heat were Frank Starback of Phil
adelphia, the champion long-distance rider
of the world; Floyd A. McFarland of Ban
Jose, Orlando Stevens of lowa and George
Bovee of Texas. The race was run mi two
one-mile heats, winners and seconds to
compete in the final." //y
Starbuck, with his remarkable chainless
wheel, set a hot pace f**oni ,"ho. crack ot
the pistol, and kept: the others jumping.
Round and round they went at a terrific
clip, alternating pace and spr'u ting time
and again. McFarland had the pole on the
last turn and kept it to the finish, Stevens
and Starbuck righting it out for second
place, Stevens getting it by a narrow mar
gin. In justice to Starbuck, it should be'
said that he only arrived here Saturday,
and is not yet in his best riding condition.
;/.- In the second s heat * were > Jay Eaton *- of
Chicago, W. E. Becker of ? Minneapolis, C.

tance been much * longer. Becker got to

To make the pace of the final heat faster

the first place long .- before ' McFarland
passed him and was in turn passed by

the seventh: lap and fell,. but got up un
hurt. His wheel was completely wrecked,
however. "â¢*..-"-"' '-?";I^.*': -;'Â«>' J /- ' '".":
. Becker made a wonderful sprins'in the
last lap and easily assumed the lead, hold

six open lengths. -McFarland came sec
ond, three laps ahead of Eaton, who
was thrown out of his stride by Stevens'
fall. The v time was 11: 25 for ' the five
miles, remarkably fast going.
Becker, the winner, was roundly cheered
for his ride. He is probably the best five
mile man in America, having won numer
ous events at this distance 'from soma . of
the fastest riders in the country. ' /
One of the crack events of '.the evening
was the one-mile scratch, professional, Un
which was entered some of tbe fastest
riders of the world. It was: run in four
heats and a final.
The first heat brought out Jay Eaton of
Chicago ; Orlando . Stevens ' . of â  Otium wa,
Iowa; C. L. Davis of San Jose and Max
Morris of Fort Worth, .Tex. Eaton has
the reputation of being the greatest in
door track rider in the business, and be
easily maintained his reputation in this
heat. He jumped the bunch after about
five laps riding, and although fought hard
by Stevens was an easy victor at the finish,
Stevens giving up the struggle -and being
passed by Davis. Tbe lime for the mile
was 2:16 4-5. : Eaton showed a , 'wonderful
burst of speed on tne last lap arid was
heartily cheered for his clever work.
Bob Terrill, Bay City ; Hardy Downing,
Garden City, and F. M. Byrne, Imperial;
all, of California, contested the second
heat* This , was . a well-ridden heat, the
men being on almost even j terms all the
way, contesting every r inch of ground.
They finished all together, the judges de
ciding Downing the victor, Ten ill second.
Time, 2:29 2-5. / '.* / .-, ' ' ' ' - / '
Those who came out for the third-heat
were Floyd A. McFarland of San 'Jose,
Harry Terrill of the Bay City and George
8. Uovee of El Paso, Tex. The men loaf*"!
for the â  first; half iof the u journey.i -but
livened up the pace toward the end fast
enough to suit the most exacting. In' a
pretty finish Terrill won, Bovee second.
Time, 2:462-5. .....................
The fourth heat brought out "â '. Allan
Jones of the Olympic, Charles S. Weils
of the Bay City, D. E. Whitman of Los
Angeles and W. E. Becker of Minneapolis.
This was the hottest beat of the race and
one of the prettiest rides of' the evening.
It. was neck and neck with Becker. Jones
and Wells the entire distance. Becker
won at the tape by some inches, Wells
being second. The time was 2:294-s::' v
This ? brought into* the final Eaton,
Becker, Harry Terrill, Davis and Down
ing, a speedy aggregation of professionals.
Terrill fell on the second lap nnd brought
Becker down with : him, -â¢ throwing them
both out of the race. Neither was hurt.
Eaton assumed the, lead on the sixth lap
and kept it to the finish, though Downing
tried hard to pass him. Davis was a good
third. â- The : time c was * 2:10 3-5. Eaton Is
by all means the fastest indoor man ever
seen here and easily maintained his phe
nomenal Eastern reputation.' ;.'-*! *â

A bout 1200 - years *â¢ ago Dympbna, ; the
daughter, of -an. Irish king, became con
verted y; to Christianity. Filled with â  re
ligious zeal she refused the attention of
all : suitors. This "so g angered ;-, her > father
that he threatened to wed her to a swine
herd. Then Dympbna fled away to Flan
ders, locating I where i{ is now the town of
(J neel. Her father pursued her and found
the Princess engaged in prayer with sev
eral insane persons; standing about watch
ing her. Dympbna's supplications were
for the return of reason to the simple folk.
Tie King then drew his sword and "cleft
the head .< from | the 1 body." I m ed el y
tbe insane men were made whole in mind.
"' Ever -ince that time the place where
the Princess Dymphna was killed has been
a sort of mecca for the insane. The town
of Gheel has grown up about it and the
little place *. is â â  certainly one of the most
wonderful towns in the world... It is gen

Perhaps the best; proof of the advance
of the Japanese in civilization is to be
found in their use of pockets. The people
of that country have usually six or eight
pockets cunningly inserted in the cuff of
their wide sleeves. ; These pockets [ are

the Chinese and other nations a pouch is
used instead' of a pocket. y This was also
the case la Western Europe in tbe middle
ages and for some time afterward. The
pouch was attached to the girdle along
with a dagger and" rosary. It was called
an aulmoniere or gipciere. It was often
ornamented' with curious patterns, gold
and. silk threads, coats of arms and reli
gious sentences. A dramatist of the time

disease aboard. The Hume was fifty days
out from Shanghai, while the Macfarland
was 101 days from Hongkong. The latter
was posted as missing and reinsurance
was paid on her. The captain, however,
meeting with adverse winds, took his ves
sel through the Straits of Sanda and
thence through the Java Sea, and in this
roundabout way reached San Francisco.
At no time was the vessel in danger, and
no sickness showed itself during the voy
age. Nevertheless as she came from an
infected port, even though 101 days out,
the United States quarantine authorities
considered it necessary to disinfect her.
The entire crew, save the officers, were
taken to Angel Island, and the men on
the Coptic had to submit to the same reg
ulation. All will be released on Monday,
however, and later the W. R. Hume and
Clan Macfarland will be allowed to dock.
The report of the latter ship is nothing
more than an account of light winds and
heavy headseas. The story of the Hume
has already been published.

Scheppler Is Still a Mystery.
The mystery surrounding the disappear

remains unsolved, for |no trace of the
youns woman has been found, although
her distracted husband and family have
hunted in all directions for h^r. ; Last
Saturday evening Scheppler, who is the
steward at Westerfei.i's \ restaurant., on
Market street, and Miss Bessie Young
were united in marriaee, and 1 the event
was followed by a reception by the many
friends of the couple at the Turn Verein 1
Hall on Turk street. From there be took
her to his newly furnished home at 1265
Guerrero street, .vyyy^'yvr.yi ;
On Sunday a strange woman called Mrs.
Barry visited the bride. - The- two held a
ten minutes' conversation on the porch.
From that event the manner of the bride
changed from the gay and . happy to the
morose and silent. Two days after, Tues
day, she disappeared, leaving on the
bureau in her home a note to her husband
stating that she had left home forever.
On the note was the bride's wedding ring.
Five days have elapsed and still Mrs.
Scheppler's - whereabouts has not been
learned. At Scheppler's place of employ

was said in that conversation is not

Scheppler could not have gone very far
because she had : only $1 50, so far as

litigation...... ;.- - '^ mtmy â  â  >--'- ;
After the death of the parents of the
Henning children, two residents of % San
Francisco were appointed guardians of the
minors, both of whom were, l by "', order of
court, sent to the residence of their grand
parents in South Carolina. ; One guardian
died and the other. resigned. Â ;; "
Wbon Mrs. de Cora applied for letters
of guardianship,- objection was made tbat
the court had no jurisdiction of the per
sons and estates of the minors, though ti.e
property is in this City, on the ground that
the children have acquired a new residence
in South Carolina, and that the death and
resignation of the original guardians ter
minated the power of the. Probate Court
in this State to make any order touching
the estate. â¢ . /â -â >â , , ,
Attorney John Yule, representing â  Mrs.
de Cora, contended that as this court* had

another State under sanction of an order
made by this court. t 4 â¢,: -^

A wide operatic field was covered by the
French company at the California Theater
yesterday. ; In the afternoon the perform
ance -was Halevy's ""La Juive" '(The
Jewess), a grand opera of the : Meyerbeer
type, and lin the evening the subscribers
'were given ] a complete diversity, in "The
Voyage of Suzette," a tuneful operetta
with plenty of - movement and clever,
sparkling dialoeue. r y"'4" 4
"La Juive" ; has been a standard opera
for over; a generation, and the reception
accorded it yesterday shows that, it has
not yet become ; a back: number. ; The
music is dramatic rather than melodious,
and is written y round a,' libretto that
abounds in startling and grewsome situa
tions, almost as much ; as the libretto of
"11 Trovatore."
j There are a good many points of resem
blance between the '2 stories of the two
works, only in "La Juive" the child stolen
for revenge is & daughter ana her end is a
caldron of boiling water, instead of the
flames, which were the fate of Manrico of
"II Trovatore" fame. -
' Prevost, the tenor of the robust high
notes, developed â '. unexpected 1 dramatic
ability in the role of Bleazar. His declam
"style of singing Is exactly suited to
the heavy music of the Jew's lines and
when he thundered forth his high notes
ala Tamagno the house encouraged him
with bravos. ; ;: '" 4'"-: 4""'".' '""'"
It is almost useless to single out any

taken into account, however, his voice has
not the volume and majesty, especially in

He was dramatic in some of the scenes,

j Although the hope is universal that the -

I Blanther was a man of the world arid .
it is considered improbable that he would
adopt a name which would " naturally'
draw suspicion to '. him. He must have .
known. that his movements after leaving
the City, had been traced as far as El Paso,
Tex., and that he should remain in
State,* where every effort would be made
to find him, seems the height of folly.

not have put himself to the troub c of

â¢ As a native of San Francisco it is but nat
ural that he should take more than an or

His Assembly bill 361 requires all State,
city and county officers to give preference
to goods manufactured or produced in the
State when contracting for or purchasing
goods or other property. One of the pro
visions of the biil requires that no bid

would prevent proper; competition on the
part of dealers in other articles of equal
value, utility or merit.
Bill No. 262 adds a new section to the
Political Code providing that no license
shall be imposed upon any person solicit
ing orders for the sale of any article
manufactured or produced in this State
which cannot be legally imposed upon a
person soliciting orders in this State for
the sale of a similar article made or pro
duced in any of the other States of the
United States.
/Bill No. 2SI punishes' persons offering
for sale any jute twine or other convict
made goods without the convict brand as
required by law;
' Bi.l 3G3 requires all convict-made goods
to be branded with the words "convict

Henry is the author also of Assembly
bill 272 requiring officers to advertise for
plans, etc., of any contemplated public
building to cost exceeding $25,000, and to
state the amount authorized to be ex
pended, and also the premium to be paid

SANTA ROSA'S SENSATION.
Evidence -Corroborating .-'.'Â£> - Treasurer
to fen's Story of the Treasury
Raid in 1893.
SANTA ROSA, Cat,. , March Public
interest over the sensational robbery ;of
the county treasury here some years ago
was revived to-day by the .affidavit of
George E. Peerv. Mr. Peery now comes
forward and swears he saw a man carry
ing a valise emerge from the Treasurer's
office just at the time at which Captain
Stofen claims to have been robbed. iy
It will be remembered that the Treas
urer was found locked in the big vault,
from which $8000 in gold wax missing,
late one afternoon in October, 1893. The
Treasurer's bondsmen ...were sued and
ju igment entered against them. The affi
davit of to-day was made for the purpose
of obtaining a new trial. George E. Pt*ery,
who makes the affidavit, was then em
ployed in the courthouse. He says he
told a number of people of having seen
the suspicious 'man with the valise com
ing irom the treasurer's office. Mr. Peery
bears a irocd reputation and his evidence
in the event of a new trial ; is apt to put a
new phase on the case. 4'J

FRESNO, Cal.. March 20.â The County
Assessor's deputies have just, completed
the collection of poll taxes in Chinatown.
They succeeded in making almost every
Mongol pay. By making the collections
early the deputies frustrated a very clever
scheme, which has been practiced by the
Chinamen tor a number of years. It was
! to get the receipts of Chinamen who had
already paid in San Francisco and show
these when the Deputy Assessors; came
around. This year the collectors went to
work before the Celestials got their re
ceipts in San Francisco. It probable
that Fresno receipts 'will now be sent to
San Francisco to deceive t c collectors
there. The authorities in the bay city
may wonder at the influx of Chinese from
Fresno.

REDWOOD CITY NATIVES.
Splendid Progress Made by Committees
Preparing for ihe Grand Par- /
â -â  f < lor's Session. ; *Â
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., March 20.â An
enthusiastic meeting of Redwood Parlor
No. 60, Native Sons of the Go.den West, I
was held in Native Sons' Hall last night.
The immediate cause of the general out
pouring ;of members was the . fact that j
delegates were to le elected to, represent
the parlor at, the meeting of the Grand
Parlor in this city the latter part of April.'
Another reason was that the various com
mittees appointed by the parlor. to ar
rangeV for the Grand Parlor celebration
were to. report, on their progress, and? a
third reason was that the parlor had made
reparations for a banquet to follow the
business session. '; '
The ways i and , means > committee as
sured the parlor that sufficient funds were
already subscribed to make, the meeting a
perfect success. They bad a plan on foot
by which they hoped to have erected be
fore April 26 -a", large pavilion.?; Although
the city : has two halt* neither is -ufli
ciently large to accommodate the crowd
expected to|be present at the grand ball,
which will be, one of the features of the
Grand Parlor session. In co-operation with
ihe city official* the committee has about
completed negotiations by which the old
school gymnasium will be enlarged to
double its present size, thereby making a
hall 100 feet square.
Tne committee on accommodations re
ported that it had engage a 1 the avail
able hotel room and had engaged sufficient
private accommodations to provide for any
number that would reasonably be ex
pected to be present.
The decoration committee outlined a
number of plans and offered numerous
suggestions lor decorating the city. It has
asked for bids from a number of San
Francisco houses for doing the work. It
is the committee's intention to beautify
the city beyond all former attempts in
that line. 444
After the parlor adjourned tables were
spread and the members indulged in a
good time, y
PORTLAND WOMAN'S PLIGHT.
Swallows a Section of Her False Teeth
and Passes Under the Sur- 4
geon's Knife.
PORTLAND, Or., March 20.-About '
three weeks ago Mrs. William J. Palton of
tbis city broke a rubber plate of a set of
false teeth. Not long afterward, and before
sue had had time to have the plate re
paired, she bad occasion to make a call,
and undertook to wear the broken piate.
After adjusting the pieces and placing
them in position, she was constrained to
yawn, . at the same time involuntarily
placing her hand over her mouth. Un
fortunately she Dressed her fingers against
her tee ih, detaching half ;of the broken
plate,' and, as her < mouth | was wide .open
and : her head thrown i back, the piece Jj of
plate and the teeth attached went down
her tbroat"y:y44*' ; -4â¢4444
;-; Mrs. Patton made * desperate effort to
catch it or eject it, but it had slipped out
j of her i reach or control." and passed into
! the stomach. In a day or two the plate
began to , trouble | her, causing her 'great
pain and suffering. . She was unable to
eat, and her sufferings increased, until it
was seen that heroic measures must .be
taken if her life was to be saved. y
A decision was reached at a consultation
of physicians to open the stomach and.re
move the teeth.; The operation was suc
cessfully performed, but to; the astonish
ment of all concerned 'â  no trace ; of the
! plate or teeth could be found. Some claim
that the rubber plate, was > digested" or
broken up in the stomach, but this theory
is as improbable as the other. The most
satisfactory feature of the case is that Mrs.
Patton has been rapidly improving Â«ever
since the operation was performed and
will soon be out. 4

SEATTLE, Wash., March 20.â Expert
accountants makin- an investigation '"? of
the books of ex-county officials y have
found that ex-Govern >r John H. McGraw,
as Sheriff (second ; term) of King County,
is short in his accounts from" $8000 to
! $10,000. ; Amounts : were collected -on ac
count of, personal taxes but never turned
into the treasury. The sums range from
! SIOO0 1> $3000. 4; ' â¢/ '.~y\-.
While the statute of limitation as re
; gards both civil and criminal prosecu
! tions has run, Mr. McGraw says tbe county,
shall not lose a cent. He practically ad
mits that he is behind in his accounts in
substantially the sum named, but says
that he neither ; embezzled nor stole a
cent. When he retired from the shriev
alty he believed his accounts to have been
absolutely correct.
Owing to the social, political and busi
ness prominence of the accused the affair
has created a great sensation, particularly
so as the expose follows closely upon the
arrestof ex-County Commissioner Heaton,
Deputy Auditor Smith and subordinate
officials. McGraw has been in public life
for nearly twenty years, having but a few
weeks ago retired from the chief 1 magis
tracy of the State. He was also an aspir

His integrity was never before questioned.

POLITICS GROWING HOT.
Fight for the Berkeley Marsha
ship Is Increasing in
Intensity.
Damaging Affidavit Made Against
Richard L'oyd, the Present
Marsha*. ]
BERKELEY, Cal., March. 20.â Politics
in Berkeley, especially as regards the
office of Town Marshal, are at the boiling
point. 4 ':.'â 
Though the election will not take place
until three weeks hence the feeling be
tween the two factions has grown ~to
enormous proportions. The fight for the
marshalship, which has been a bitter one
at every election for; the ;pa*<t ten years
because ol the importance attached to the
office on account of the liquor law in the
college town, has probably become more
marked this: year than at any-time
hitherto. â¢
What appears on its face an attempt to
administer defeat to Richard Lloyd, the
present Marshal, who is \up for re-elec
tion, was made public to-day. It is an
affidavit from the hand of Hugh O'Neill,
in which he offers some damaging evi
dence against Lloyd, charging him with
malfeasance in office by i permitting un
lawful practices ot the 1 qaor men at the
West End, with the view 10 securing their
patronage and support Jin the coming
election. The 'following sworn statement
made by O'Neill appeared in the Advocate
this evening: 4Y* "â -'â  x: :i / :

strong, of the few against the many'; of the
oppressed and down-trodden and the tax-rid
den against the oppressor and taxmaster and
the taxgatherer.
It is the old, old story, found g upon count
less pages of the world's history, sung by bards
and repeated by mothers to their children, of
all that life holds dearâ sweet song of civil
and political liberty.
The first proposition that we have to con
sider iB whether the Cubans have the right to
set up housekeeping; for. themselves and take
their place among the nations. The second,
Has the Government of Spain any right to
maltreat American citizens? [Cries of "Noi
No!"] y 75441:
I It seems unnecessary to speak these ques
tions to American people, but after the fact
that now for more than two years the Govern
ment of the Nation has stood supinely by and
turned a deaf ear to the cry of her citizens in
the dungeons of Cuba.
It seems unnecessary, but after the fact,
well certified to by the American Consul at
Havana, that the Spanish authorities have
been. in the habit of seizing American citizens,
and in the face of the treaty stipulations with
this country throwing them into the dismal
dungeons for more than 100 hoursâ yes for
mote than three monthsâ it is not unneces
sary.'
It may seem unnecessary to state these facts
but for the fact that we cannot forget the
many acts of cruelty that have been permitted
to go unpunished. Against the prison-house
registers of such' as perish<*-from di-ease and
neglect we find the inscription, "Died from
natural causes."
Let me call your attention to the other ques
tion presented. .-
Should the Cuban patriots be permitted to
set up housekeeping for themseives and be
permitted to take a place among the nations,
independent of Spain? In that immortal mani
festo, the Declaration of Independence, our
forefathers being about to sever their relations
with the British Government, we find good
cause for tneir action. Hove the Cubans good
reason for severing their relations with Spain?
The applause that greeted Mr. Jordan's
question showed that his audience thought
they had. The remainder of his speech
was devoted to showing the pood cause
by statistical testimony. He demon
strated that the Cubans were taxed with
-out proper representation and that the
taxes were squandered in paying the in
tel est on Spain's national debt, the sal
aries of useless officials and in many other
ways, while tie was used in lifting the
burden off the isiand. He was heartily
.'applauded at the close of his oratorical
effort.
At the conclusion of Mr. Jordan's re
marks Mr. Jones, secretary of the San
* Francisco Cuban League, handed Mayor
Pbeia'n the following telegram, which was
read to the audience:
New York, March 20, 1897. â 
. John ff. Jones, President, Metropolitan Temple,
San Francisco: The souls of Washington and
. his compatriots are marching on. Friends of
Cuba rejoice that her independence is near.
The people are faithful to the obligations of
our revolution, though cowardly official? hesi
tate. Men shall live and brutal -iynastie*
must die. Ethan Allen, .
President Cuban League of the United States.
Henry E. Highton then took the plat
form. He said be was glad such an audi
ence was present, but on such an occa
sion had expected the very streets would
be alive with people. After speaking in
. the same patriotic strain as the preceding
speakers, he offered the resolution of the
evening. ', ; \,i "i 4*j4 h
. It was pnt to a vote by Mayor Phelan.
An uproarious ' cry of "Aye" came in re-,
sponse, while three persons shouted "No."
The Mayor said he hoped those mis
guided ones would remain afterward and
be convinced of their error. He then in
troduced Hon. Samuel M. Shortridge,
whose appearance upon the rostrum
celled forth ' a spontaneous burst of ap
plause. Mr. Shortridge spoke as follows:
Because I believe in liberty, because I be
lieve in self-government, I am here, and not
Â§ ashamed to be here [applause], to answer those
gentlemen who voted in the negative on that
resolution. What does that star-spangled
banner mean? [Cries of "Liberty!"] For
what did our forefathers bleed and die unless
It might be for self-government and freedom
to worship God as they chose? For what did
the foremothers of this Republic, the wives
and the daughters of the Revolutionary period,
give their sons, their fathers, their husbands
to die unless it was for liberty and for self
government? [Applause.]
In these weak and piping times of peace,
this timid, this sordid, this almost cruel and
material time of civilization, men lorget, men
turn away from the holy cause, that inspired
' our fathers in the darx days of the Revolution.
. [Applause.] The demands of trade, the prices
of flour, or tobacco, or potatoes, too much en
gage the high thoughts of the people of this
age. "4V-
The cause of liberty, the cause of self-gov
ernment, is just as important, is just as
sacred, is just as holy as when it was cham
pioned by Patrick Henry, by Samuel Adams,
or when it was defended by the immortal pen
â¢of Thomas Jefferson. [Applause.] Is the
theory upon which our country is founded
â¢ correct? . Are all men born. free and equal? Is
man entitled to self-government? Does civil
ization best flourish when men and women
md children ore free? If so, if the teachings
of statesmen, if the writings of our great
leaders, if the experience of our country can
..answer those questionsâ then I say that It Is
for the interest not only of this couutry, but
for the patriots who, are fighting and dying
to-night, that they too should be free.
I do not forget, Mr. Mayor and chairman, I
do not forget certain legal principles or rules
*by which*' we must be guided. lam aware
that there exists a treaty of peace with Spain,
and I caution you, ny countrymen, that the
treaty entered into by this country with any
" foreign country is the supreme law of the
land. It is as supreme as the constitution of
the United States itself. Nor do I forget that
. upon the statute books there exist certain
laws, certain provisions which are all em
braced under the Idea of the neutrality laws,
the purposes of which laws are to prevent the
individual citizen from embroiling his own
country in trouble with the affairs of the
country with which we have a treaty existing.
Nor do I forget the sacred, overshadowing
doctrine enunciated by President Monroe.
[Great applause.]
What can we, therefore, as citizens, legally
do to assist those who are struggling for that
which we enjoy? "What can we do to give
them nope, to give them cheer ? What may
this country or what can this country do as a
nation : . without violating International law,
without violating the treaty ?.."' Or what may
we do as citizens without violating the neu
trality laws to assist this country that is strug-
ing upward into the light â â of. freedom? In
spite of the apathy of the last administration,
to use no more severe term, I say that it is my
Judgment: and the judgment of the vast ma
jority of the people that there have been many
occasions within the last two years when the
Government of the United States might have
recognized the belligerency of the Cuban in
surgents, cr revolutionists, without violating
either the treaty or any international rule of
law. [Tremendous cheers.] 4
. I say that those men are . not a mere handful
of insurgents. They have been and they are
to-day revolutionists, asserting the Inherent
right of revolution, and there has existed in
that island for. nearly or perhaps more than
two years an actual, open state of war, and
when that exists, according to every textbook
upon the subject, this Government 1 could rec
ognize the Cubans as belligerents, and that
means a vast deal in a struggle ,of that char
acter, ' Cheers.] 4, - .â ' â¢ -
â¢My fellow-citizens, it is not asked that the
United States at this Juncture physically inter

of bis rights. [Applause.] It is not asked that
our navy shall blow that of Spain out of the
ocean, It is not askea that this country shall
send an Invading army to Cuba; but they have
come upon bended knees, their tears fretting
channels in their cheeks; they have come
upon bended knees to this great Republic of
ours and asked us to recognize that a state of
war exists in Cuba, and that the Cuban
revolutionists shall be given all the rights and
enjoy all the . privileges of belligerents
according to the law of nations, that they
shall be treated as contending forces and not
as rebels or pirates. And 1 say that,' accord

RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED.
WHEREAS, For two centuries and a half or thereabouts after the discovery of America both North and South America
were dominated by European monarchies and empires; and â  _ -.-. r 4
WHEREAS, Since the declaration of independence and the formation of the Government of the United States, by pur
chase, by treaties and by successful revolutions, of which the last and among the most important was that in the vast territory
of Brazil, monarchical and imperial rule has been rapidly superseded in America by republican Governments, largely founded on
the principles of our own Republic, until towards the close of the nineteenth century, with the exception of the Canadian Con
federation, itself having a recognized autonomy of its own, nearly the whole of the North and South American Continents is
occupied by republics; and :
WHEREAS, By these successive and extending movements, which have acquired a substantial footing in Europe itself
through the establishment of the Republic of France and by various modifications in other . European Governments, the funda
mental conception of our political institutions and the inherent and growing power of our system have spread and become
rooted throughout the civilized world, until the rights of the masses of the people everywhere to protect and control themelves
and their property by their own votes and through political organizations founded and perfected by and for themselves, has se
cured widespread recognition, and is fast advancing toward the liberation of humanity from caste, from privilege and from every
form of monarchical and imperial despotism; and ' ,j * . * 'â :
WHEREAS, In respect to their own history and development and the results flowing therefrom, and already largely crys
tallized into fact, the people of the United States, American in name and character, necessarily have sympathized, and now
sympathize with every aspiring community everywhere which has striven or may strive for individual liberty and for political
independence; and * ' '.4 '1 \ ' ,"," Â 4 '. - "\ ' '/.{â 
WHEREAS, The monarchy of ' Spain, withdrawn and driven from every part of the continents of North and South
America, still retains nominal possession of the island of Cuba, "the gem of the Antilles," in close proximity to the southeast
ern portion of the United States, and our own citizens have large commercial and other interests in that island ; and
WHEREAS, After previous attempts to secure, for themselves personal freedom and political independence, which, al
though unsuccessful, were nevertheless formidable, and, when defeated, were followed by the most arbitrary confiscations and
exactions by Spain, the natives of the island of Cuba, for three years or thereabouts, have maintained an armed insurrection,
which the Spanish Government, with all its resources of men and money, and exercising continuously the most intolerably ty
ranny, has proved itself impotent to suppress : and ' *' * â¢ 4
WHEREAS, The Cubans have not only organized and maintained, during this period of three -years, an army with
able and patriotic leaders, and have been .engaged in a contest, with Spain, in which they have been successful, in : both de
fensive and aggressive warfare, but have also framed a civil Government upon a basis analogous to our own constitutional sys

WHEREAS, During the existence of the Civil War, various questions as to the recognition of belligerent rights, and
as to the preservation of the lives and the property of our own citizens, have arisen â¢ between the Government of the United
States and the Government of Spain, and it has become evident that, under insufficient pretexts, and by shameful methods,
American citizens in Cuba have been imprisoned, executed and deprived of their property; now, therefore, be It
RESOLVED, By the citizens of San Francisco in mass-meeting assembl d: : '.X' : , i
1. That we extend to the Republic of Cuba, now in ; process of formation, our earnest sympathy,;
which voices the prevailing sentiment of the civilized world, and our hope and belief that the revolution*
ary movement so long sustained amidst disheartening condition*- may be permanently successful, and
that the tyranny of Spain may give place to an independent and constitutional Government in the Island
of Cuba, resting upon and supported by the free consent of the peope. ! v 4 4 1
; V 2. That, while fully acknowledging our own primary duty and obligations to the Government of the
United States, and the necessity for ; the. just application of the law of natio s to the civil war in Cuba,
and to the relations between the United States and Spain in connection therewith, and without desire to
embarrass the present administration in dealing with the questions which that civil war has produced,
we nevertheless respectfully urge upon President McKinley, and his Cabinet the propriety and expedi
ency as promptly as existing conditions of / lact may permit, if possible, with the co-operation of other
Governments, but, if not, on behalf of the United States; of according to the Cuban Republic belligerent
rights and as speedily as justifiable recognizing its independent existence as a Nation. i
3. That we heartily indorse the declaration of the present ; Secretary of State, John Sherman, im
mediately after his accession to that high office, fortified by the inaugural message of President McKinley,
to the effect that the hole power of the Government should be exercised to preserve the rights and the
liberties of American citizens in foreign countries, and that we demand the vigorous application of this
policy on behalf of American citizens in the island of Cuba

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, . SUNDAY, MARCH 21, 1897.
Pierce when he was President, and, over and
above them all, according to the theories and
the instruction of Webster, the Colossus of
American statesmen, according to the
theories and the instructions issued
by Henry Clay, the great spirit
of National patriotism, the time has been and
is now when tbis country, through its execu
tive department, might recognize those Cu
bans as belligerents with all the privileges that
such recognition Implies. [Loud applause.]
We as citizens cannot fight with arms
for them; we as citizens cannot violate neu
trality laws. We cannot violate treaties
with Spain, but we as menâ because God made
us men before we were citizensâ men
and as citizens we can call upon the
administration at Washington not to be false
to the spirit of American institutions. [Great
applause.] And I trust"; in God, who yet
will permit all bis children to be freeâ l trust
in God that the patriots there will bear .up
bravely, and that the men who are at the
head of this Government to-night may see
that it is their ' duty to recognize them,
give them a chance for liberty, and to do
it before the iron heel of â¢ Spanish des
potism -- has "- crushed â¢= the last spark lof
liberty from the breasts of the Cuban patriots."'
(Tremendous* and j long-continued applause.]
It is -unnecessary, or it ought to be unneces
sary, to say more to an American audience.
We profess loudly upon the fourth day of . July
to believe in liberty. We profess upon many
occasions to do honor to those who gave us our
freedom, but are we true to the sacred and
holy cause of freedom when we do nothing to
aid those who are following our glorious ex
ample? Do we leserve that which we enjoy if
we will ' not hearken to those who are strug
gling for liberty? .".',.' X-X y,
i ; Fellow-citizens, the words 'that we are utter
ing to-night may not outlive the hour they
are spoken. The resolutions, so luminous and
so true, that have | been read, may not attract
the eye of those who have power to act and to
speak. Our united voice may not cause one
word to be echoed in Washington that will do
this cause good, but so sure as the sun rises to
morrow, Vso | sure as - the cause of j justice :is
right, and so sure as the cause of liberty is
just and holy, I believe that the liberty of the
Cubans is in sight or will come. jg [Long-con
tinued applause.] I do â  not know what you
think now, I do not know ' what :my friends
think who voted no, but I want to hear all in
favor of the resolution say aye. â 
The' applause that followed was deafen
ing. Amid tho yell of "aye" which rose
in thunderous tones if there. was one per
son who said "no" his voice : could not be
distinguished.
Mr. Shortridge j then stepped from . the
platform and Mayor Phelan essayed to
speak, but the applause rose to such a pitch
and was so long-continued that he could
not say a word. At the beckoning hands of
those on the platform Mr. Shortri.ige was
obliged to return. As he was once more
escorted by the Mayor to the front of the
platform there was one long cheer and
immediately afterward the ticking of â¢ a
clock could hare been distinctly heard.
I Mr. Chairman, he said, I am afraid that I
will be like Corbettâ go, up once too often.
[Laughter and cheers.] I yielded in a moment
of weakness to come again before you. There
is one thought that I would j have lodged in
your minds and abide in. your hearts forever,
and that is that the man who is ashamed or
afraid to plead tbe cause of this country in
season or out of season is in my judgment not
a true citizen. .' [Great applause.] I wish,
since you have done me the great honor,
which jI . very fully appreciate, - of , wishing
to be detained ,â  a y moment longer j by.
me, I wish - ' to { enforce this thought also
a little more clearly, perhaps, as to the right
of belligerents in a case such as this. . I say
that, according .to the .books that have been
written upon the subject ol law, I say, accord
ing to the construction: that has been placed
upon the treaties and the duties of
one State or one nation not to â¢ inter
fere with the affairs of another, that the
occasion is now, wnen this â¢'â . country, â  with
out violating our; treaty, could recognize
a state of belligerency and accord to both
sides of the controversy equal privileges to
purchase arms and munitions of war, equal
privileges to fit out cruisers, equal privileges
to purchase whatsoever: may be essential to
the carrying on of the conflict. â¢ "
Remember that so far Spain has treated
these men as simply Insurgentsâ has treated
them with the brutality so ably portrayed by
the talented and honorable gentleman to
whom you have already listened, and the
point is whether the United States, recogniz
ing her treaty with Spainâ keeping her
hands j offâ may now under International
law : accorc* ' to 4 these patriots the
privilege ot belligerents engaged in
revolution. And if the books were here,
though I would Invite those who j have the
interests of this matter deeply at heart to
consult a work in | three volumes termed "The *
Constitutional War of the j United States,"
containing the messages of Presidents, con
taining the instructions of Secretaries of State
to our foreign Ministers and Embassadors,
the construction placed upon this question
of belligerency; and I repeat it not dogmati
cally, but as the humble opinion of an humble
man; I repeat it that If Thomas Jefferson were
in the Presidential chair, if Monroe, if Clay, if
Webster (unfortunately he never was. but he
should have been there) they would have seen
ample opportunities to recognize, a state of
war existing jn Cuba. And that is all that Is
necessary, an actual open state of war, to en
title a people to be recognized as belligerents.
I am not now speaking of recognizing them
as a sovereignty, as a free people; they have
not yet fought their battle, to success, but 1
hope and believe, if it is not too late, and I do
hot wish to criticize those who have passed, as
I will not criticize those now in power, that
the time is ' now when '. William McKinley
has *y the constitutional and 'will
have the courage and the Americanism to
recognize the belligerency of the Cuban
patriots. [Uproarious applause.] Â-_::.*
We can do no more to-night. Liberty has
had a hard struggle in this world. . -
Man has enslaved his brother, white and
black, and we would have owned the island
of Cuba in 1852 if it nad not been for the un
fortunate and, as it proved to be, sad fact of
negro slavery in this country.
We would have owned Cuba then, but the
fear was that slavery would be perpetuated
and the slave power would be strengthened.
Thank God, slavery in our country is. dead
forevermore. The Cuban slave has risen to
burst his chains asunder. ".". 'â '
May heaven smile upon and bless his sacred
cause, the holiest cause that ever nerved the
arm or fired the heart of manâ -the sublime
and glorious of Freedom. - 4 , '."â :â :
Colonel T. V. Eddy in response to the
call of the chairman, then I mounted the
platform amid prolonged applause:
I notice, he began, that the . hour is getting
late an i we have listened to about all that can
be said, in my judgment, although we have a
very greatquestion to discuss. When invited,
something like , two weeks ago, to come here
to say a few words to-night, I did not know
that so large a number of distinguished gen
tlemen were to talk to you and it has been a
matter of the greatest gratification to me to be
permitted to sit as an auditor and listen to the
burning words of eloquence that have issued

weakness in support of the cause of those
struggling patriots down r there on our south
eastern coast, that my heart thrilled, and as I
sat here to-night I could feel the blood tingling
in my veins as the sorrow and the woe of those
people have been delineated and explained
before us here.
. It seems impossible to me, and I was abso
lutely shocked to know that there could
gather in such an audience as tnis, even three
young menâ and I saw them; they sat imme
diately before meâ who, when that resolution
was out as to whether or cot the people of San
Francisco should extend their sympathy
and â¢ word Sof good cheer to those strug
gling patriots, that menâ young | menâ
en *oying all the advantages of this grand
Government of y onrs, based -y upon the
principle of Individual liberty and uni
versal freedom, could in those stentorian
tones voice the word â¢â¢No." [Applause. [
And -I am not surprised that one of them,
after giving utterance to that word, seemed to
feel that he was in a position where shame
should be his portion, and that he hid his face
behind the back of the chair. ; [Laughter and
applause.]
| The distinguished orator : who has just left
the platform has very carefully and very ably
discussed before you ana analyzed the legal
rights of the i eople oi this great Nation. He
has told you that you and I are prevented by
law, we are prevented . by. treaties, by these
white cruisers which glisten down hero in the
bay, from taking up arms or by any overt act
attempting to do anything to assist along, the
cause of the revolutionists in Cuba.
'But did you ever stop to think that in the
past history of this great Nation when' the
fathers and the sons and the brothers and
the lovers and the husbands were down in the
forefront of the battle, there was also a potent
force at work which sometimes I have thought
did more to carry the war for the Union to a
successfull issue than, perhaps, even the arms
in the bands of some of our soldiers? Do you
know what : it was? y- it was the heartfelt
prayers of tbe sisters, mothers and wives on

resting in the heart of every one r.i those
patriotic men when he offered up his life as a
willing sacrifice upon his country's altar, that
he was fighting not only his own battle, but
the battle of the loved ones behind. And he
knew when he walked on succeeding days into
the hell of strife that if he won a victory, that
victory was a victory for universal mankind. E
And so with us. If we cannot shoulder a
musket, and If our Government, respecting its
position, respecting: its relations with the

assist, we as individuals can pray to the same
God that our mothers, sisters and' wives
prayed to in the years that are past and gone
and we may ask of him who rules the nations
of the earth to grant strength: and power to,
the arms of these who are fighting the holy
battle ol freedom. [Loud applause.] Let me

This struggle that is going on in Cuba is
going to turn out just as other struggles have
turned out waged against, the tyrannous
power of Spain. [Applause.] We have the re
public of Brazil, the republic of Guatemala, of
Peru and of Chile- We all know that once
they were dependencies of ' Spain. They
fought these battles one after another until, as
was so eloquently said, there is not now in
the Western Hemisphere a nation as a nation
that has not a President at its head. [Ap

So will it be ln a ver** short time that on our

Cuba. (Loud applause.]
When that time shall come, the sons and
daughters of men drinking deep life-giving
draughts front freedom's crystal fountain and
feasting upon the precious fruit that grows on
liberty's tree shall sing hosannas of praise to
God and gloriJy that day of birth. V
Here the speaker digressed briefly to
criticize the policy of the late President
toward Hawaii, and proceeded:
. "One thing, however, I think we can
felicitate ourselves upon: If we can only
take for truth the ringing words that were
uttered by our new President when he ,
tailed of American citizens, we may rest '
assured that irom this time on a man who !
is an American and owes his allegiance to
the stars and stripes will be protected by \
this great Government. [Applause.]
* "We have passed these resolutions unan
imously. I only hope that as we pass from
this presence the sentiments contained
therein will find an abiding-place in our
hearts and minds, and after we have gone
from here let every man and woman who
believes in those principles, who believes
in liberty, in justice and .in patriotism
constitute herself and himself a commit
tee of one to stir up the feelings of the
people of San Francisco, and let us see. if
there will not go. forth from this City a
moral force which wiil have some influ
ence upon the ad (ration, Too king to
the recognition of Cuba. [Applause.]
"It was grandly said to-night that it
seems as if this generation has grown so
Bordid with the lust of gold that patriot
ism has become crowded out. I have
often thought that the moral vision of
mankind has become perverted, unless,
indeed, it is blinded by the glint and glit
ter of gold. To-day we find the great
powers combined together to crush out
one little nation that has the bravery and
the patriotism to seek to protect Christians
from murder at the hands of the Turk.
' [Prolonged applause.] v .
"Let me ask you why? Is it not a fact
Germany, Russia, England, Austria, these
great nations, are controlled in' what is
called the Eastern question, and in con
nection with the politics of the Old World
to-day simply, because of gold? It is the
bondholders of Berlin, it is the bondhold
ers of England, of Vienna, of St. Peters
burg that are stopping those nations and
paralyzing their arms. â  Did â¢ you read the
other day the grand sentiments from the
pen of the grandest statesman of the day
and age, William Ewart Gladstone, when
he gave utterance to those words and won
dered, he said, if the arm of justice bad be

"And so even may we wonder. Is the
arm of justice in our grand country be
come paralyzed? Was it the fact that j
even the moral support of this Govern- j
ment could not be extended to j the Cv- |
bans because New York merchants had j
interests at state in Cuba? . Was that it?
I think it was. But I thank God that, as
the greatest President this country ever
hadâ Abraham Lincolnâ -once, said, there
is in the heart of the common people all
that is necessary for the preservation and
the perpetuity of the grand â¢â institutions
under which we live, ; and I say to you
there is springing from that heart of
the common people â and I thank
God I belong to the common peo
ple â all over the broad land
a sentiment which, shall go up as an in
cense upon high; there is a sympathy
welling from the hearts of the people
which will be a moral force in behalf of
the Cubans such as no President and no
Government can resist." [Prolonged ap

OLD LOVERS TO REUNITE.

Peter Rafferty, who gives his age as 70,
yesterday hied a suit against his wife,
Susan Rafferty, of the same ace, asKing
for the annulment of a contract entered
into between them three years ago, by
which it was agreed that they should live
separate and. apart during, their natural
live?, he to pay her $40 a month.
Mr. Rafferty, sets forth that he and his
wif* were married fifty years ago, and that
they lived together *as husband and wife
in this City for thirty-seven years,' the first
ten years of their married life bein*-; spent
elsewhere. In 1894 thay quarreled and

has asked his wife :to return to him, he
offering to love, Honor and care for her as
in the old days when thoy were young to-*
gether.
Mrs. Rafferty's response to this affec

Rafferty's complaint, but there can be but
little doubt of her acceptance when" she
reads her husband's prayer that the Supe

The largest crowd of the meeting saw
seven decidedly interesting events run off
at Emeryville track, yesterday, three of
these being stakes. Miss Rowena took
the flying stake for fillies, Ed Purser's fast
mare Scarf .Pin annexed the Rancho del
Paso handicap, and Esperance at long,
odds placed the stake * hung up for the
i Flood hurdle handicap to the credit of his
I owner.
The weather was cool, and a stiff breeze
I blowing over the course prevented any
thing approachine record splintering.
I Nearly all of the different races were well
i contested, first choices in the betting
j managing to show first at the wire on
I three separate occasions. All of the win
j ners were well supported, and the buyers
of odds had. bellows to mend at the con
] elusion of the afternoon sport.
The flying stake for two-year-old fillies,
I distance four furlongs, did not attract
ranch of a field. It was worth $700 to the
winner, and five snriphtly misses faced
the issue. The Burns & Waterhousa duo.
Miss Rowena and Napamax, coupled in
j the betting, were pronounced favorites in
| the ring, the ruling pnce being 4to 5. Of
I the others, Free Lady at 11 to 5 and
! Marsha called for the most backing.
There was no noticeable delay over at the
post. Miss ; Rowena,- with Martha as a
close attendant,' were tne contending ones
throughout, Eddie Jones on the former
defeating Tom Griffin's filly with Marty j
Bergen in the saddle, a bead in 48lÂ£ sec
, onds. Napamax, when it looked as though
her stake mate might be in difficulties,
came like a ghost the last 100 yards and
was beaten but a neck for the show. 4 4
The Rancho del Paso handicap, over a
mile, for. three-year-olds, with a guaran
teed value to the winner of $950, called
out a held of six. el aria, the burns
cvWaterhouse entry, with 115 pounds up,
opened a 6 to 5 choice, later' receding to
3 to 2." The outsiders, The Roman- and
Grandezia, were accorded mucn support.
It all ended in a hollow victory for Scarf
Pin, the . second choice, piloted by Sloan.
She waited on The Roman into the
stretch.and when given her head fairly
romped in over three lengths ahead of the
favorite, in 1:42. Good Times possessed
no speed whatever. Aquinas was also a
fizzle, never looking a contender.
Last on tho card and the third of the
states run was the Flood handicap at two
miles, a hurdle affair with eight obstacles
to clear. Opening at 9 to 5, Baby Bill,
shouldering top. weight, 150 pounds, was
backed down to 6 to 5, though 2 to 1 was
obtainable around post time. A wild
plunge on Tortoni cut the gelding's odds
from 25 to 8. Of ' thr- : others, Arundel,
played from threes to 8 : to 5, carried the
most coin. Baby Bill paraded out in
front of his company for over a mile and a
half, when he began showing unmistak
able signs of weariness. JO C soon passed
him, and the chestnut horse's backers
betran diving for their tickets, when
Esperance happened on the scene, and
passing the initial horse won with ease.
Time, 3:50.
A mile selling event, with a field oi
eleven starting, was first decided. Thelma,
ridden by T. Sloan, was made a pro

Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald departs
for the Hawaiin Islands next Tuesday on

Both will remain there six weeks.
The nature of Mr. Fitzgerald's mission
is well known, as the invitation extended
him by the people of the islands to come
there was given wide publicity by The
Call a few weeks ago. He goes with the
view of investigating the feasibility of
supplying the islands j with white labor,

CHRISTIAN AND
BUDDHIST DEBATE
Dharmapala, the Indian
Priest, Before the Philo- 4

Lectures on the Differences Be

Professor H.wison Puts Questions
and the Very Root of the

Dharmapala, the Buddhist priest, who
comes to this country as a missionary of
his faith and whose lectures before the
Theosophical Society, have attracted such
wide attention, delivered a lecture at
Berkeley on Friday evening before the
Philosophical Union .oh the ? differences '
between Buddhism and Christianity. The
occasion was made doubly interesting by
the questioning to which the young priest
submitted after the lecture at the- bands
of Professor Howison. The professor J
strove to get at the core of the Budd ist'
'belief, and Dharmapala strove to explain
it so far as the great teacher himself made
it plain. 4 .4 ;
The lull text of the lecture as delivered
was as follows:
Two thousanl five hundred years ago a great
event occurred in the evolution of religious
thought in Asia which resulted in the accept
ance of a new conception of man's life and a
revolution jof theological ideas which had
hitherto gained implicit and unquestioned
obedience. The enunciation of new ideas of
life liberated man from the manacles of the
priests, the fatalism of the prophets and the
sensualism of the annihilaiionists. The labors
of Darwin, Huxley. Spenser, Berkeley, Hume,
Mill, in England; the services of the German
philosophers have resulted in bringing the
change from antiquated theological ideas of
the Semitic! and tne Persians to a scientific
'acceptance of the evolutionary nature of the
universe. Eighteen centuries of ecclesiastical
supremacy in the domain of theological dog
matics have been dominated by the patient
researches of analytical scientists, and the
world is thrice happy that it has been liber
ated from the shackles of intolerance and
leligious persecution. Just as Europe had
been before the dawn of the scientific era
under the domain of the rriests and their
theologies, so was India in thÂ« centuries before
the birth of Buddha. v r> -
The people were divided Into, castes, the
priests arrogating to themselves all power,
royally given second piace.the common people
treated asserts and kept outside the pale of
enlightenment. Priests were the mediators
between gods of the uppar regions, whose
chief was called Brahma, to whom prayers
were addressed as the Father of the World, the
Supreme Creator, the Preserver, etc., and men.
Ritualistic observance", penances, frsts, ablu
tions and holding festivals, worshiping the
element?, sun and moon, drinking wine and
invoking the different angels and God, consti
tuted religion under the hierarchy of the
Brahman priests. They were saints who led
their lives as ascetics, some Imitating the
nature of fowls, of bats, of the dogs; some
mortifying their body by the heat of the fire;
some by exposing themselves to cold, rain and
sun.* They were independent speculative
philosophers, who in teroreted . their theories
according to the . experiences oi the sensa
tions they had in their philosophising.
Monotheistic, polytheistic, pantheistic, ag
nostic, animistic and nihilistic theories were
current at the time. Superstitions, mystic
symbolisms, astrology, spiritism, had devo
tees.:- Skeptical dialecticians denouncing the
buffoonery.-, of 4- the : priests who .... chanted
the vedas and .sacrificed to the gods.' Just at
this time there was born a son to King Sud

from the tur>ita heaven to be born on earth it
is said that it was in full consciousness that he
entered the womb. This msrvelously psycho
logical phenomenon of retaining conscious
ness from one life to another is the peculiar
heritage of a world savior and none other.
To be a world-savior tne Prince in his previ
ous lives for hundreds of incarnations had to
fulfill the ten perfections of absolute charity,
holy life, renunciation, truthfulness, forgive
ness, wisdom, determination, cultivation; of
will power, univer al compassion and equal
mina-'dn< For four (asankhya) immensities
and a ; 100,000 of world ; cycles the tuture
Buddha these perfections were practiced, r The
last life was tne life of consummation. The
father of tne Prince was .extremely solicitous
for his welfare, and all precautions were taken
to keep him from danger. : Ten thousind
worlds rejoiced when the Prince was born.
Celestial beings sang and glorified him. When
he was 16 years of ' age he was married to the
Princess YasodliHra, who was of the same ago
as that of the Prince. Clasped in love's em
brace they. both lived till the twenty-ninth,
year, when a boy ; was born to them. -It was
then that the Prince made the great renuncia
tion unparalleled in the history of the world..*
For six years he studied the philosophy of
the Brahmans, went through the ascetic train
ing of the yogis, mortified his body- in the
hope of finding out the Path of Deliverance.'
By experienca he realized the useiessness of
the ascetic life of the Brahmans , and was not
satisfied with their philosophy which taught
a permanent ego living in a state of cessation
of perception and sensation. ' Sensualism did
not give him satisfaction and mimical
yoga was tried and found wanting. There was
no immortality in either conditions and there
was no religious life in sensualizing enjoy
ment and bodily mortification. He struck out
a new path, avoiding the extremes of sensual
ism and asceticism, which he called the mid
die path." He discovered y the, true ' religious
life, which helped him to see truth. He real
ized the immorul'pjace. .
He found that lie had become perfectly en
lightened and he uttered, ln the triumph of
his glorious victory, that be had become 'the
Supreme Buidh**, the chief of tho worlds of
gods and man. His life from that moment till
p the final passing away was one F of i Incessant
activity. .' For lorty-five â¢' years he . was X the
acknowledged leader of all. Kings, princes,
nobles, brahmans, all bowed before his blessed
feet, and as the friend and protector of the
suffering world he marched with his band of
disciples, numbering a tnousand, proclaiming
the gospel - of ' peace; * compassion - and holy
living. â ;- ;,.-â¢ ' "*.:â â¢â :.
'. Incidents in the life of Buddha are so often
quoted as to show the similarities that exist
between his life and that of Christ, but as yet
no attempt has been made to show the differ
ences between the two lives. "is . y ; :, ,*
The Buddha as a world savior chooses by his
own will the mother who is to give him birth *,
he selects the country and the time that he is
to be born in. The time he was born was one of
the greatest* religious "â  activity. India, -with
its 200,000.000 of people, was on the tiptoe of
expectation " of a great " religious * leader. Po
litically they were .Independent.:., Greece i had
her Pythagoras, Nebuchadnezzar was reigning
in Babylon, Confucius and Laotze were be
ginning to shed their light in China, and the
Jewish God Jehovah I had I given a new cove
nant to the Jews, revoking the o d command
ment given I through" Moses on Mount Sinai.
The world has never yet witnessed so great a
period in the religions history o man. As a
world savior he came down from heaven and
took birth in the family of the Sun Kings of
India and made sacrifices"? in:" renouncing
everything .for M the ; sake of - humanity and
'showed:. an examples to the world that great
men could make sacrifices. He experienced
domestic happiness till his twenty-ninth year.

ministry not one word of malediction "ever es

"A religious; life is well taught 'by meâ an

. Buddha's; religious teaching is to be found
in his glorified life and that of his immediate
disciples. Religion, according to Buddha,*. is
not a tacit acceptance of certain dogmas or
metaphysical theories aoouta soul, or a god
or speculations whether the individual ceases
to exist or not. >â â '.'.': - : y
Buddhism rejects the . superstitions of the
animistic creeds, which teaches ' creation of
souls by a creator deity. It rejects the fatalis
tic idea of man's enslavement in the absolute
sense to the law of causes. It repudiates the
theory of the annihilationists that life ceases
to continue after this existence. 4
The teachings of the Buddha are based on a
monistic philosophy, an ethical code and an
idealistic psychology. A unitary conception
of nature's laws, the permanency of the law of
cause and effect, a continuous change in, the
universe caused by perpetual motion, the in
finite nature of consciousness, the immortal
ity of every living being, the eternal condition
of the mind when it is freed from ignorance,
lust and haired, the attainment of this state
by a holy lifeâ these are the fundamental doc
trines of Buddha. The Nirvana of Buddhism
is the unconditioned condition of the per
fected mind. The perfect being realizes that
his consciousness has attained complete per
fection and he is sure he has attained immor
tality never again to enter the realms of suf-.
fering. This immortality could only be real*
ized by the destruction of ignorance and self
ishness and by Jeading a compassionate life of
perfect unselfishness guided by wisdom.

Attained.
Two hundred and sixty men were at
worK yesterday on the new boulevard and
to-morrow ..probably 300 will be given an
opportunity to earn a dollar apiece and
10 cents extra allowed for carfare to and
from the distant place of operations. :' :
The deeds to rights of way through ex-
Mayor Sutro's and the > Spring Valley Wa
ter Company's properties were received
by the Boulevard Association and depos
ited in the Nevada Bank, to the satisfac
tion of all concerned. , . '-1-. -â¢;
The work; fund thus . far .- subscribed is
$9710 70, but between 15,000- and $20,000
more will be necessary to complete the
boulevard as far as Ingleside. The drive
way is to be 100 feet wide and finally cov
ered with a layer ,of macadam ten inches
thick, or more than twice the usual thick
ness/thus insuring a substantial roadbed.
All the rock is â to be supplied free of
charge from .-â¢ ex-Mayor Sutro's quarry,
near by. ' â  - -
p The committee in charge and members
of the Boulevard Association particularly
wish that . citizens may go out to inspect
the work and to observe the diligence of
the men employed. ; Tn*Â»y wish ;to show
the public, that every man is earning his
dollar and .that none of them, as was the
case in the park work done two years ago,
is shirking.
Cornelius O'Connor of the Boulevard As
sociation and an active member of tne
construction committee, was on the ground
nearly all yesterday.; He said that an ar
rangement is to be made for a conference
with a committee from San Mateo County,"
whereby, arrangements may., be made for
the extension of the broad, easy driveway
through that county and eventually to
San Jose.
:-... "More money is needed," said Mr.
O'Connor, '.'to insure -work : for others of
the unemployed in addition to those al
ready, employed. Already., 1966 1 men are
registered as applicants "for places, and
260 have been put to work, many of the
public spirited and charitably inclined
citizens have given money, but there.' are
rich men who have not yet subscribed. '
There are '; several thousand cyclists in
this City and they are ever talking good
roads. Now, there is not one of them that
could not afford to contribute a dollar or
two dollars toward giving a deserving man
a day's work and at the same time aiding
very materially in securing a magnificent,
broad, picturesque, sheltered drive to the
City. : â ",.'-. ;V444 [X-Xm^mx,'
"Let them : raise a cyclists' fund for the
boulevard work as an evidence of their
sincerity lin "â¢' always clamoring for good
streets. Let them do this or forever hold
thrir peace." >
"The object of this. boulevard, "*said C.
C. Beamis, who is president of the Boule

structed : and attractive road out of San
Francisco. ;.- "t'*-',:' 4-
"J he Sun Bruno road by the bay shore
is narrow, rough and often traversed by

from there on to San Jose is a fine county

'For, cause of contest the children say
that the pretended wiil. was procured by
the widow of their father, to whom she
â¢was married June 15, 1896, her name be
fore marriage being Frances Forbes; that
McKenna was an old man, weak in body
and mind, and was subject to the wishes
of Frances McKf una; that she did not
permit him to converse privately with his

Attorney. Charles. L. Wheeler. is about to
J pull some chestnuts out of I the fire for
Mrs. Craven's benefit, however unpleas
ant the task may be to the lawyer. Judge
Slack has fixed Friday next as the. 'day on
which Wheeler is to tell all he knows
about what the Fair children call a con
spiracy to rob the * etat* of their father. .
The lawyer was taken somewhat off his
guard and found himself in the tanglefoot
yesterday almost before he knew it. The
day had been spent in argument between
Deimas and Wheeler over the right of the
Jatter a? to the attorney of that young mil
' lionairess, Miss Virginia Fair, to intervene
in the suit between . Mrs. Craven and the
executors of the bonanza estate over the
so-called pencil deeds." The case was set
for Monday last, but Miss Fair's attorney, 5
for the purpose of delaying the case, filed
an Intervention pleading, churgimr that'
the deeus were forgeries and that v con
spiracy existed oh the Craven side* of the
bouse.* -â â â -;.-- *. - : -j:. â X.XX.'Z.'Si"

when he asked; that Whesler tell ,all he

emphatically and wanted,, to argue the
point. There was a sharp passage at arms
between" the lawyers, *in which talk ; : of
"deodorizing" the big case seemed to be
principal idea. y Wheeling, however,
*^lwas not willing to make the desired depo
sition t and Judge Slack , finally ruled that
he would bear it himself in open court
on Friday next at 11 o'clock. y - y':. y-viy '

Father Anthony Haraschi, the venerated
member of the Society of Jesus who passed
into eternal. rest on Thursday last, was*
buried from St. Ignatius' Church yester
day morning. Thousands of mourners
thronged the sacred edifice, all drawn
thither by many kind thoughts for the
memory of the dear departed.-;' y 4 ,44
The same unostentatious simplicity that
crowned the life of the -venerable priest
marked the funral services, making them
all the more solemn and impressive. '44-
Jno sermon was preached, â¢ no eulogy
I upon the many virtues 'of the dead de
livered. Neither was there the music so
frequent at church lunerals.
i Only the church offices for the dead and
â  a low requiem mass were celebrated, the
Rev. Father Frieden, president of St. Ig
| natius' College, presiding. Attired in the
plain black and white robes of his -office,
as were also the assisting clergy, they
added to the sublime simplicity of the
ceremony.
No attempt waa made at -elaborate
i funeral decorations. ; The altar space was
draped with a heavy pail of black edged
with white, and numberless tapers burned
in their places in the sanctuary.' -â  444'
No outside aids to solemnity were util
: izedânone were needed. Neither during
nor alter â¢ tbe services were the mourners
permitted to gaze upon the placid, be
nignant features of the beloved dead. This
privilege had been accorded to thousands
on Friday while the body, lay in state in
tbe chapel of the Gentlemen's Sodality.
â¢ The casket containing ;. the . remains of
the deceased rested . in front of the
sanctuary. It was the gift of the Ladies'
Sodality of St. Ignatius. It was covered
with black broadcloth and ornamented
with silver bandies and a ... name-plate,
on which was the inscription :
EEV. ANTHONY ASCII!, S. J.
Pled March 18, 1897. '
Aged 77 years.
The body of the' dead priest was clad in
a purple chasuble, a trimmed . stole
and alb.' y '""" .4
The services began at 8:30 and were
concluded by 10:30. At the conclusion the
casket was lilted from its support and
carried in . procession down the main
aisle. â  . - - f
A cross-bearer, holding high the cruci
fix, walked firsthand after him, walking in
double file, came a long line of * acolytes,
brothers and priests of the order, bearing
brevieries and lighted tapers. They pre
ceded Father Frieden, who walked imme
diately before the casket. 4 44

JAPAN'S GOLD STANDARD
â â ___â  _.-â -.â -.
Its' Silver Supply Will Not Be
Disposed Of, but U:ed
at Home. y
The Free Coinage of th? White Metal
Wi 1 B- Stopped for a Long
Time to Come.
The probability, or rather almost cer
tainty, of Japan following the example of
the United States in adopting gold as the
standard currency of that country l has
given the financiers of San Francisco con
siderable , food 4 for speculation and
thought. Recent J dispatches from , the /
Orient have given the impression that as
soon as the gold standard is adopted by
Japan that country will at once dispose of
the most of . its ' silver. Bach a course
would seriously affect the money centers
of : the world more or less, for heretofore
Japan has been a good market for silver
and San Francisco one of the main ship
ping points of this metal. '. y , y â â¢
.The idea that Japan proposes to dispose
of all her: silver and deal â  only ;in { gold
coins 's wrong. .With a view of learning
exactly the position of Japan on this mat
ter parties in this City s<*nt for Information
on this point. An answer was received on
Friday. by cablegram which says: y
The Japanese Government has no intention
of disposing of its silver, even alter the adop
tion of the gold standard. 'All available stock
of silver will be Converted into subsidiary
coins. ' .'"; - , \
Mr. Aoki, the San Francisco manager. of
the Yokohama. Specie Bank, stated that
he is informed that the substance of the
cablegram is correct. The measure pro
viding for the establishment of the gold
stand ard for Japan will â¢ probably pass
both houses of the Parliament in October.
He sr.y* that the same measure will also
provide for changing the value of the yen.
'At present; this coin has very nearly the
same weight and value < as the* American
dollar. The ' new yen will 'be:- about 1 the
value of ;.a" 50-cent piece. The first gold
coinage will be that of the 20 yen pieces,
worth and weighing about the same as the
American $10 piece. f y. ; 4--, ;Â«Â»,;
Manager Aoki" states; that while y tbe
available silver in Japan will be converted
into small coins for common use, the tree
coinage of silver will be stopped for some
time to come. -This means that the world
has o"en deprived of one of its best mar
kets for silver ? and. 'that j this "is, compen
sated by the fact that another; market has
been found for tho world's gold. â â :. â " ' ;-./â ;

subjects, when J. W. Kerr stated , that the
matter should be acted upon at once, but
with caution, to prevent ruining the busi
ness of those engaged in manufacturing
jellies and preserves.
He said that since the crusade of the
Board of Health had begun he bad been
called on by a manufacturer, who claimed
that he was doing ' a business of $253,000
per year in making jellfes, and that much
of it was made from the leavings of East-'
crn canneries boiled down and shipped to

y It also developed that large quantities
of fruit of brands found to be adulterated
had bean | shipped to. interior . points ;to
escap- condemnation and is being sold at
forced sale. Mr. Kelly of the Merchants'
Association offered the following plan for
preventing \ the ' sale 'or manufacture of
foods injurious to health or offered under
false labels:
1. For the', information v and protection of
dealers in and manufacturers of articles of
food the Board of Heath shall be lreely per
mitted, through its inspectors, to examine
and inspect all goods offered for sale, aud sam
ples of the same shall be furnished by dealers
and manufacturers voluntarily for analyses
by the official chemist of the Board of Health.
2.* The findings of the official chemist of the
Board of Health, regarding Injurious or fraud
ulent articles of food, should he publicly an
nounced, so that all dealers and manufactur
ers may take cognizance thereof. ;
3. Dealers or manufacturers in whose pos
session articles of food are found that are in
jurious to health, or sold under false labels,
should be notified of that fact by the Board
of Health. The articles so declared Injurious
or fraudulent should be confiscated. :
4. Any dealer or manufacturer .wno, after
official. notice from the Board of Health or
public declaration by the Board of , Health,
that certain articles of food are injurious to
health or sold under false labels, continues to
sell or manufacture such articles of food,
should be punished as provided Â»n section 363

Eugene Deuprey has already expressed
, himself 6as entirely ", satisfied ; to have
Knight on the list of his lieutenants, and
unless Knight himself should change his

probably take an active part in Durrant's

y While hot fully decided as to the advisa
bility of tbe course Foote has expressed bis
j determination to do anything in bis power
to assist the stricken mother, and may,
with Knight, join hands with Deuprey

Our annual sheep and cattle show hat

gathering of the kind in New Zealand and
this | year a I record was -. ea ta uhshed, there
being over 20.000 visitors. Sin-. this crowd
a lriend of mine missed his dog, a Scotch
collie named Mike, with whose help some
prize sheep from, the Meadowbank estate
had been brought to the grounds and
penned there. Not being able to find the
dog my friend concluded that he bad gone
to the house where ho had been tne night
before, but upon; inquiry. iound that Mike
had not done so. Upon returning to the
showgrounds he found the dog watching
one of the ''Meadowbank sheep that had
jumped out of the pen. He took no no
tice whatever of *t ho other j sheep which
were being moved about the grounds, But
stuck: faithfully to ih^ one truant, wnich
he evidently considered under his care,
until relieved :of his > self-imposed charge
by the welcome arrival of his master, who,
with Mike's help, soon had:* the wanderer
back in the fold again. V I after ward heard
that some one-had tried to help Mike re- 1
capture the sheep, . but 1 ; the | dog ." ri son ted,

Once again the subject of a new City
Hall for Oakland is before t c public, and
it is not unlikely that at au early, date an
election may be held for the purpose of
voting for or against bonds with which to
make the improvement. The old wooden
hall, which wa< partially burned many*
years ago. has always been an eyesore to
the oeople of this city, both on account of
its cheap appearance and because of the
intonvenience to which every one is : sub
jected who has any business in its dingy
4 apartments. â Â»
I It has been condemned by the Police ;
f and Health-Board, but a little patching
up i as tided it over for the time being,
until now it can be patched no more.
'Every week a hunt is made to locate some,
new source of offense, and it invariably
ends \in the finding of a broken sewer or
â¢ some leaky pipes. 44^4
The last discovery in this direction was
made under Judge Woods' chambers. After
being sick for two weeks he ; decided that
there was . something wrong with the air
6Â£ bis courtroom. An investigation was
â¢ made, the floor was taken, up, and be
neath.it was discovered that a drain pipe
had been emptying its contents there for
years undisturbed.
. The hall is so rotten tbat when prisoners
wish to escape they pull out a few of the
pieces of stone and board that form the
. foundation and walk to liberty. A little
while auo a prisoner who was acting as
*, cook took out a section of a wall at the
back of tbe stove and did not return to
finish bis sentence. On another occasion
three, men pushed away a piece of wall
and Were captured just as they -were seal
'â  ing the prison fence on the outside of the
yard. *-4>4.'
Alameda's New City Hall of Which She Is Proud and Oakland's Gvic Pile of Which She Is Ashamed.
Still again a lad was confined in a cell,
but not liking the situation he pushed off
' the top of the cell, and *â *. hen the lodgers
were being released in the morning he
quietly, departed .with tbem. More re
cently still a prisoner, put his j hand out
side the wicket of the cage, broke off the
rusty bar that held him and quietly took
his leave. ' . . - "â â  .
Upstairs the condition is no better. Al
though the charter orders that a safe shall
he built.in the City Hall for the purpose
of holding the city's coin, such a thing
has never been done. It cannot be done
a becau-e the hall is so rickety tbat to build
a safe in the Treasurer's department would
mean the demolition of that section of
the building. . The dusty joists could not
support an ordinary strong-box, and if
such a thing were attempted as the erec
tion of an iron room it would fall through
into the jail. 'â¢.â¢.â .4
Although about five times the size of the
city bf Alameda, the smaller city basset
a decided example in the matter of having
an adequate municipal building of which
they can be justly proud. Nearly . two
years ago Alameda's handsome brick and
'â â tone structure was completed J and it-is
now the most complete building for the
Â» size of the city of any municipal pile in
the State. While Aiame a has been build
ing Oakland has been talking, and a com
parative view of their municipal buildings
would be more creditable to Alameda and
Milpitas than Alameda and Oakland. In
Mayor Chapman's time six years ago, be
tried to induce the' people of this city to
. cut Washington street; through the City
Hall Park, and to erect a stately structure
on the east tide of the /extension. Plans
were'drawn and it was shown that such a
building, with the prison in the topmost
story, would be a good investment for the
city. But as soon as bonds were men
tioned there was a cry against it, and
â¢nothing was done. Now that Oskianders
are enjoying the benefit of magnificent
pubric schools, built through the issue of
bonds, the desire is renewed to *o and do
likewise in reeard to a City Hall.

DISCUSSED '-. CANDY-PULLS.
Methodist MlnUtKrs Hit- Different
Opinions Regarding Chinch Sic. als.
. Oakland Office San Francisco" Call,
90S Broadway, March 20. f ;
â¢ The Scandinavian* Methodist ministers
met yesterday and had a lively and
interesting discussion on the subject of
candy-pulls. New â  England dinners and
similar things and their relation toward
the support of a church. . . .
Rev. J. O. Wahlberg handled the sub
ject: ."Is it Biblical and necessary to
have socials and collect money for the
church?" 'x ,x'M'P>y^--'' ", t
"So far as dime socials, candy-pulls,
New England dinners, grab-bags and ba
zaars are concerned," he said, "we have
never arranged for them nor patronized
them in our church. They are not Bibli
cal, but they are worldly. They are not
necessary. What is their purpose? We
are told it is to support the church and
bring the young people together, but it all
we hear be true there are not many red
cents left when the expenses are de
duct-d." . 4 ; â â â -, 4 m
After the conclusion of the paper a de
bate followed. Key. Mr. Anderson thought
that an entertainment could be planned
so as not to leave injurious effects and be
of financial benefit to the church, to which
Rev. Mr. Andrews replied | that he consid-
ered them one of the murderous features
of religion.' Rev. Mr. Boattstrom feared
the church social, with its freedom from
all restraint, was often the means of draw
ing young people away frem the church.
Rev. Mr. Erickson considered it one of
the greatest evils in the church, and Rev.
Mr. GustafÂ»on asked if any one could teli
of a sinner wbo was ever converted at a
church social. .. 44 '
- A practical view of the situation was ad
vanced by Rev. Mr. Peterson, who said:
"We must remember. that the reason ye
have socials is - because we go a little
farther than we can afford. If we do away
with the social we. have to depend on the
liberality of i members?" - Rev. Mr. Peter
son thought socials should | be a source of i
mutual intercourse between, churches.
He objected to socials , where there was
"mere empty talk" and advocated a pro
gram me of ; literary ; merit 'or v'a"< good
concert. Â , I -X-
Rev. Mr. Larsen thought that as Christ
.was not too holy to break bread with
sinners, church folks should not go to ex
tremes in debarring their members, from
socials. "â¢'. * - - "-:'â â â â

Wah I berg had answered all objections,
but no common stand was taken, as it was

different views of the question. >yy

.Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
;â¢ 908 Broadway, March 20. . )
The brother of Helen Dab), the young
girl who on the complaint of her father
was rec ntly ordered to Whittier, declares
that his sister has been wrong ully treated
and he is making a great effort to prevent
the carrying out of the sentence. .- .'/
William Dahl had . an interview this
morning with Sheriff White and with his
sister, who is yet in the Couny Jail. He
declares that the girl is not wayward and
that she left home to go to San Francisco
because of the cruel;.- treatment of her
father.
"If father had only treated her in a
fatherly way and advised her this trouble
would have never occurred," said be.
"There was no one on the farm to take
the girl's part and the continual nagging
made ber dissatisfied with home life.
Some time ago she was allowed to go to
San Francisco to learn dressmakin: and
while there lived with ray sister .Jennie.
Jennie is wild and is being supported by
a man : named John Coftey. 4
. "Of course, while living there Helen
was not guarded as she should have been.
Later she was tn ken ;â > home, I but â  fathei
still' continued his fault-finding and sus
picion of her every act until she ran awa
and stopped in San Francisco for a week
"She has no de-ire to go on the stage
and is a good girl if treated decently, but
father's treatment does no good. It
was this same treatment of his that drove
my oder sister from home and also caused
me to leave. "y Â- 4 .*
Young Dahl seems sincere in bis efforts
to protect his sister, and an effort will. b
made to have the commitment revoked.
He is a carpenter with steady work in San
Franci-co, and claims to earn enouch to
provide tor both himself and Helen.,: TniÂ«
lie says be will do if civen an opportunity,
and if necessary the Governor, will ,be ap,*
pealed to so that the chance may be given."
The friends of the girl at Haywards are
inclined to believe the brott/er's story, and
it is not unlikely that the young lady may
have another chance to redeem herself.

M For the past few year* Telegraph avenue,
which is the only bituminized street in
Oakland of more , than a few blocks, has
been a continual nuisance. It has always
been studded with "numerous chuckhules
and instead of A eing what it .is intended
to be, th- best 1 boulevard in Oakland, it is
j along way inferior to many macadamized
streets.
4 Tbe â : Merchants' Exchange recently ap
pointed a committee to inquire intoth f|
condition of affairs on the. avenue and
make a report. In one : time the ; report
was mad- and published, and it contained
so much that was offensive vto the j street

that this large sum of money is wisely and
Judiciously ' and economically .; expended.: I
â¢ ully agree with Mr. Miller on this point, but
cannot , understand how the Street Depart

Mr. Miller has singled me out of all the peo

A member of the Grand Jury, since a Coun

stopped by somebody, namely, the filling of
the holes on Telegrapu avenue with rock. Mr.
Miller knows ! this . gentleman also. Why
doesn't he go for him? . p.*. . -y
Why did .he not convince the City Council

BERKELEY, Cal... March 20.â Four
records were smashed this afternoon at
the university field day, notwithstanding
the fact that a cold, blustering wind con
tinued to blow throughout the entire list
of contests. Edjrren 'broke i the 16-pound
shot record by 3 inches, casting! tlie ball
40 feet 9 inches; Miller lowered the 100-
yard low hurdle record by 1-5 of a second,
covering the distance 'in 12 seconds flat;
Drumm smashed the record of 23 4-5 for
the 220, lowering it to 23 2-5 seconds.' But
the greatest surprise of the day was the
breaking by Griffin, a freshman, of ; the
one-mile walking record of 7 minutes
26 2-5 seconds, made in May, 1891, by G.
H. Foulkcs. .
Griffin covered the distance in 7:24 1-5,
I thus : shaving j the record |of six years'
j sanding by,. 2 1-s .''seconds'.";.-' He is looked
i upon as a phenom, and gives great prom
ise of cutting his record of tc-day by sev
eral-seconds 'more.- Even Merwin, him
self the winner of so -many : contests on :
Eastern tracks in '95, and Blake, who have
been the best railers since the : days .oi
Ikes, did not approach within i live sec
onds the record made by Griffin. .This
young , heel-and-toe ground-gainer comes
from Oakland, and is takina a course in
mining at he ? University. The surprise
sprung by Griffin tallies with the predic
tion made in tnis morning's Call.:
After Edgren had : broken the univer
sity record in the shot-put and established
a new one, Cheek came to the front and
exceeded the old record -f 40 .cci 6 inches
by one-rjuarter of an inch; and .hus five

DEEDS TO TERMINAL LANDS
AEE FILED.
A Passenger Terminal at Oakland An
ticipated, but That Will- Wait
en the Future.
The bay terminal of the Valley road, or
at least tbe fir^ one, is to be Point Rich
mond, on the Contra Costa County shore,
and the ferry-steamers of a competing
road will be running from there to the
foot of Market street and Cnina basin just
as quickly as the surveying and construe-
on of the line from Stockton can be ac
complished.
That Point Richmond would be the bay
terminal of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley road was rumored two
months ago, when knowledge of some
quiet negotiations leaked out, but it re
mained ' only a surmise until : yesterday,
the officials of the road admitting only
that' Point Richmond was under consid
eration among other portions of the bay
coast, as was the fact.
Yesterday, however, the surmise became
a certainty, when deeds to the Point Rich

Valley Road.
mond properties were' filed at Martinez
ana Chief Engineer Storey outlined the
terminal plans at last decided upon.
Point Richmond is a little peninsula â
a natural mole extending from the Con
tra Costa County shore to deep j water,
some distance north of West Berkeley and
nearly opposite Tiburon. This finger of
land projects from a long body of land
called the Potrero of the San Pablo
Ranctio. which consists of a range of low
hills parallel with the coast trend and con
nected with the rest of the mainland by a
stretch of marsh.
The jutting peninsula called Point Rich
mond is entirely contained in an irregu
larly bounded piece of land comprising
fifty-seven acres, which is deeded to the
company by John Nicholl of Oakland.
No other parcels of dry ground have yet
been deeded to the company, but through
other deeds filed yesterday the company
acquires tideands lying on either side of
the point. These tidelands reach to the
outer end of the point, and may. be filled
or dredged, as required. The tidelands
on the north side of the point which have
been purchased comprise 110 acres belong
ing to the Crooks estate, and only an undi
vided interest in this property has been
acquired. The transfer of this interest is
effected by deeds , from A. 8. McDonald,
a real estate dealer of Oakland, who
acquired the property for the company.
The tideland in the south consists of
about nine acres, acquired by McDonald
from the Tewksbury estate, and by him

now transferred to the company. The
property acquired, by the company thus
consists of about 175 acres, of which the
largest part is tideland. Other purchases
of land in the vicinity, made by private
parties for speculative reasons, will be
come known soon. * '.
* The decisive selection of the bay ter
minal of the Valley road marks another
great stride in the rapid development of
this competing system ' which means so
much to San Francisco as well as to the
interior of. the State. This planning of the
enterprise in the -eastern bay shore is a
palpable appearance at the City's gates of
what has been a hope and a prospect.
Chief Engineer Storey, in a talk with a
Call man yesterday, said that. the next
step would be the selection of the route to
Stockton, and this will soon be done.
"Soon," . in a matter like ". this, means
a few months. Surveyors are in the field,
and Mr. Storey expects that the route will
be definitely settled by early fall at the
farthest. There will be no delay in the
processs, as tar as the company is con
cerned.
The route between Stockton and Point
Richmond remains uncertain, except that
the terminal selection made means that
there is no longer any possibility that the
road will come to the bay through the
hills behind Oakland or the shore to the
south.
''There are several possible routes," says
Mr.' Storey,' indefinitely. ', \
One possibility is that the road may
parallel the Southern Pacific route, swing
ing around "past Vallejo Junction and
Martinez by following the bluffs above the
Southern Pacific tracks in a general way.
The most natural and most likely route,
however, appears to De the one by Wal
nut Creek, which is pursued, as far as it
goes, by the California and Nevada nar
row gauge. From Point Richmond the
Valley road can cut directly northeast
ward across the Southern Pacific line, and
reaching the little valley of San Pablo
Creek, where it emerges from the hills,
follow it upward to Walnut Creek and go
on through the interior of Contra Costa
County.
When the route \ is selected, after the
careful consideration of surveys and other
matters, there will be no delay in con
struction, unless such delays are enforced
by others, and it is Mr. Storey's expecta
tion that in a little more than a year
trains will be running from Bakersiield to
Point Richmond, and ferry-boats to the
foot of Market street and to China Basin.
Point Richmond is admirably adapted
for a railroad terminal, the distance from
the San Francisco water front not being
the obstacle it may seem to many at first
thought. It is seven miles in a direct line
from the ferry depot at the foot of Market
street, and passenger ferry-boats will have
a straight run of that distance. The dis
tance across the bay to the Oakland mole
is nearly four mile-, and it is six miles to
the first stopping-places, by train in Oak
land, so that the straight run by water of
the fast ferry-boats of the Valley road
will be as quickly made; as the ride to
Oakland. It will be less than a mile more
than the r.de ;to Tiburon. The run to
China Basin will be but a little over seven
miles and s but little longer, than the dis
tance the Southern Pacific freightboats
travel from the freight terminal on Oak
land Creole.

water, six fathoms lying close to the outer
shore, there will be no costly mole to
build and maintain, and the only invest
ment required, aside from the natural
depot facilities, will be for wharves, docks
and a little dredging. While the terminal
facilities located there will doubtless be
extensive and comparatively costly the
additional cost of reaching deep water
required at any other available point on
the Day will not be imposed. â¢ : , m.-i&f .,
The selection of Point Richmond may ]
worry Oakland, which is keenly interested
in securing the terminal. A committee
of leading citizens was appointed a short
time ago to confer with the directors of
the road to find what wants the company
bad in connection with Oakland. The
absence of Claus Spreckels has so far
delayed conferences. ' '- . -"-.-I :".
However, Oakland will probably get a
Valley road terminal in the futureâ either
a near or a distant future. An Oakland
terminal is one of the wishes and plans of
the company, and after, a while its pas
penser ferry-boats' will probably be run
ning from Market street across to a mole a
little north of the Southern Pacific mole.
When this comes about Point Richmond
will remain the freight terminal, while
passenger trains will proceed down the
bay shore by some route inside of the
Southern Pacitic line and out on the mole.
And when this comes it may be antici
pated that there will be connection of
some sort with a street railway system to
handle the suburban . passenger . traffic
across the bay, which would become; an
important feature of the Valley Road
Company's business.
But an adequate terminal . having been
secured the question of petting into Oak
land will be allowed to work itself out as
the future develops. Now every energy
will be bent to connecting Point Rich
mond and Stockton with steel rails, and
the money will be ready as fast as wanted
for this extension, as well â¢as the one to
Bakersfiold, which will , hardly .; be ;l com
pleted before the other is under way. It
is possible that next season's wheat cron
may fill warehouses of the Valley road at
Port Costa and Point Richmond.
This is all another : display of the vigor
and ability with which the construction
of the Valley road has been pushed and
managed from the inception of the great
enterprise. â  .: V . Â«, "

Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
- 908 Broadway, March 20. J
A. S. McDonald of this city went to
Martinez to-day - and recoided * six deeds,
which makes it absolutely certain that the
Valley Railroad has decided to locate its
freight terminus at Point Richmond,
near San Pablo, in Contra Costa County,
about twelve miles north of Oakland.
All the deeds are made out direct to tne
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad.:
The deed of most importance ,is < from
John Nicboll of this city co about fifty
acres of upland adjoining the property to
which a deed to Claus Spreckles was re
corded some weeks ago. -y yyy yX
The other deeds are from % David ;, Crooks
and Ida Hodman to A. S. McDonald, wbo
in turn deeds them over to the Valley]
Railroad. The deeds j refer: to large ;i sec
tions of tide land on either side of Point
Richmond proper. In order to reach its
terminus the railroad must cross the land
of the Emeric estate. ' ;":':'
The Point Richmond move is not re
garded as being in any sense ; hostile ; to
Oakland any more than are the wharves
at Port Costa.' i/As soon as President Clans
Spreckels returns to San Francisco "and is
ready to meet * the Oaklanders the inter
rupted negotiations will be'renewed, and
it is the opinion of tbe ; local commercial
bodies that the road will most assuredly
continue its passenger, service to this city.

riding teacher and a regular "musical
night" was inaugurated, held every Thurs
day night. The; musical night became
very popular, the :â  band â¢ being - placed \in
the gallery and to its music the* horses
were put through the figures of the dance,
marched and countermarched..
These meetings were sustained by those
who attended; that is, on all members of
the ciub' who - attended was levied an
eqnal share of the cost, so that it was a
private affair rather than one of the club,
tbe club treasury not being taxed in any
way. y ' ''-Â' /,~ '
These meetings Mr. Crocker never at
tended. -Indeed,' it is said be seldom ap
peared at the club at all except to preside
at the meetings of the board of directors.'
It was, therefore, a great surprise to the
members, of the club when Secretary
Quarre. appeared last Thursday evening
with printed notices, bearing the presi
dent's name, stating' that the "musical
night' -.would be; discontinued alter, that
evening. \ Tne secretary was about to post
one of these up in the office when Captain
Dilhan remonstrated.
The discussion grew loud and anery and
was heard all over, the building. > The two
I were ; i in the -office with the door shut.
Suddenly tt ere was a crash and the ladies
in the ring knew tbat the words had come
to blows. ; X' y- :: ''y'Xy
There was & rush toward the office, and
the secretary of the club was discovered
witn bis knee upon the chest of the rid
ing-master, his hand upon his throat,' the
riding-master being prone upon his back.
Quarre was using bis free hand upon the
riding-master's face.
The two wrestled about the -room, up-,
setting the furniture and causing a panic
among : the . on-lookers. The ry; ladies
screamed, and the men interfered, but be
fore | vhey were parted ? both men were '
badly damaged, Dilhan particularly.
Quarre explained, by way of apolog'zing
to the ladies,. that he could not brook the
conduct of the "paid man." He was so ex
plaining, at the same time putting his
clothes sto s rights, when t Dilhan > entered
and struck him again.
What had taken place was child's play,
to what followed. Both men fought hard
and again overturned y.the- furniture.
Quarre was getting the best of the fight
and his brother : was â¢ crying for "fair
play" as against those who ; wished to
separate y. them, for *"'' Quarre's ;; brother â 
joined in Quarre's dislike! of the riding
master.
At last one of the stablemen got into
the room and between the men, and by
striking out right and left finally sepa
rated i them. * Dilhan's ' face was a sight.'
The "musical evening" was spoiled.
A meeting of the board of directors was
called for the next â  afternoon. President
Crocker and all the;. members were pres
ent. They. are: H. J. Crocker, George
Newhail, Baron yon Schroeder, William
Lent. Mrs. Fannie Lent, Mrs. William A.
Hooper. '-'.', :'â :/'â -
It was proposed to dismiss both Dilhan
and Quarre. The matter was discussed at
length. The majority, sympathized with
Dilhan, and - were 'â  against his 'dismissal.
They favored the musical evening, and re
sented the dictation of the president in a
matter which they felt did not concern
him. Besides the musical . evening ; was '
spoken of as tbe one particular attraction
ol the club, making it* popular. v
When the inteiference of one of the
"paid men" with the secretary was referred
to they answered that : the secretary him
self received $50 a month from the club.
So â¢ no ;â¢* action was taken. 'â â -. The ': musical
evenings will be continuedâ the board de
cided thatâ and Mr. > Crocker 'and Mr.'
Newhali, who wishes :to sustain him, de
clare they. will resign. X"X

trouble to look them up without paying
a doorkeeper or feeing a.custodian.
The "free shows" of our City are not ad
vertised in our newspapers, and therefore
it is that comparatively few avail them
selves of the privileges which belong to,
and should be enjoyed by, the many.
There are San Franciscans who have
spent all, or the greater part, of their lives
' here, and yet have taken advantage of
but a small part of the opportunities
within their reach, simply because their
attention has never been called to the fact
of the other's existence.
As for our visitors, the great majority of
tbem come and go with the firm belief
that when they have seen the park, the
â¢ seals, and Chinatown, they have beheld
all that the town, in her capacity of
hostess, cares to show her guests; but this
is far from being the case.
Surprising as the statement may seem
to those who have not informed them
â¢ selves on the subject, it is, however, a
fact, and one to be proud of, that in no
' other city in the United States has more
liberal and varied provision been male
for the edification of both "home folks"
and "company" than has been made here
â¢ in iree-handed San Francisco.
Our City herself has a world-wide repu
tation as a "show place." Her beoutiul
i -v, her terraced hills, her cosmopolitan
population, her palatial private resi
dences, her fine business blocks, her richly
*inrÂ±ti*~mtt "*' and lÂ«Â«r markets, full at ail j
I seasons of the year of epicurean delights,
\ all unite to make her, in her own way,
F one of the most interesting cities of the
, world. :--;/."": -y ;
It is not, however, of San Francisco as a
.City that this article purposes to speak,
but of San Francisco as a eracious chate
laine and of the ways, in which she strives
to please her own household and all those
who claim her hospitality.
The oldest and best known of the four
museums to which the public has abso
lute freedom of entry is in the Academy
of Sciences at 819 Market street.
Forty-four years ago,. when the Acad
emy of Sciences crystallised from an idea
into a reality and occupied verylimited
! quarters on Clay street, a small collection
â¢ of scientific curios was placed on exhibi
tion there and proved a great attraction
to those who were not too busily engaged
in . money- making to think of such
matters.! :'"*/â ' v*?.r/ '-'' : _*y

The late J. Z. Davis was for many years
curator of this museum and made it many
generous gifts. The , recently elected cu
rator, Charles A. Keeler, of Berkeley, is a
young man: full of enthusiasm regarding
the work before him, and has already
planned several changes that will add
much to the interest as well as to the use
fulness of the institution.
Among the recent notable additions to
the collections is an exhibit of tapa cloth,
and the implements ; and earth dyes used
in its manufacture, which were purchased
j from Mrs. Helen Osbourne with, money
left for that purpose by Mr. Davis. Pro-
I fessor David Starr Jordan has also re
cently presented to the museum six fine
specimens of the fur seal and a sea lion,
which he secured during his summer's
visit to the Pribyloff Islands. .;
Besides inviting the public to its mu
seum the academy gives a course of free
lectures which take place bi-monthly
I from January to the midale of March.
The speakers are all noted scientists, and
the subjects with which they deal are
selected with a view to interesting as well
as instructing their audiences.
The museum of the California* State
Mining Bureau, on Fourth street, near
Market, is not only what it claims to be â
"an exposition of the mineral wealth of
the,- Pacific 'Coast"â but is a surprisingly
varied and excellent exhibit of the min
eral resources of the world. . . |
Specimens of the rarest as well as the j
commonest minerals are on view here,
and even visitors absolutely destitute of
scientific knowledge cannot fail to be in
terested in the well-arranged and well
cared-for collection of minerals and ores.
The practical utility of this museum,
however, far outweighs its /great value as
a mere exhibition. .By its policy of secur

for quartz only can here see in how many
different mediums gold has so far been
found, and. familiarizing themselves with
the appearance of the various gold-bearing
rocks and deposits, are enabled to "wrest
her golden secret from the earth": in

Clarence King, in. 1863, .was almost the
first man of.: scientific attainments that
penetrated into' this unknown land. He
it was who discovered the great canyon of
Kings River and described wonders in
a most fascinating book of j adventure arid
exploration. After King other; travelers
undertook the hard and perilous journey
and brought back stories of the most mar
velous character concerning" its valleys,
peaks, canyons and streams, but for some
reason the enthusiasm of those who love
to explore new scenes was riot aroused, or
else they were deterred by trie ur.accessi
bility of the various marvels and the diffi
culty of traversing what' at: best is an in
hospitable arid forbidding region.' ; .'i
But within the past year this region , of
the high Sierras has been visited by ex
plorers who have given to the world most
enthusiastic accounts of the -, charms
which this country offers -to the. tourist

measly bad to-day." ;/.'/;
"Samples for the cabin table," said the steward, Gordon, dabbing the
flabby offal. down on the dresser.
'â¢Ho," says the cook, "they'd best be cooked separate, I suppose.
The smoke'U break the young lady's heart if they're both boiled in them
coppers."
"Cook 'em as you like. That's your business," said Gordon. "It's for
1 o'clock." .'./" ;â 
"Who's going to eat 'em ?"
"How big's a man's windpipe?" asked Gordon. They eyed him.
"Would about that lump do?" asked Gordon, snatching up a knife and
slightly scoring a corner of one of the pieces, "fit a man's windpipe?"
"Ah, would it?" muttered the cook; "and if you'll let me guess whose
pipe it is you're a-thinkins of I wouldn't mind telling you tbat I'm game,
s'elp me God, to ram it down with thisâ a clean job." And seizing a long
black sharp-ended poker he flourished it at Gordon's mouth, poising it a?
though he meant to do for the steward. - i/-r
Gordon rounded out of the little caboose with a half laugh. ;
.Mr. Tweed walked the weather side of the quarterdeck, his sextant
lay upon the skylight cover. The seaman named Legs was at the helm.
His figure, airily clad in duck and cal co and wide straw hat, stood out
like a painted figure of marble, as it slightly rose and slightly fell against
the hot, pale-blue sky in the north. Miss Vanderholt was seated in a
deck chair under the awning, beside a quarterboat. y A book lay upon
her lap, but her. hands were clasped upon and* her eyes were bent noon
the sea. She viewed it listlessly. The monotony of that eternal girdle
was crowing shocking. It seemed to bind up her very soul. She thought
to herself: "Tbey speak of the freedom of the sea. But doesn't its sense
of freedom come only when motion is swift, when the roar of the white
water is strong and when one's home is not very far off?"
It was tbe men's dinner hour. Miss Violet had often during the warm
weather from her comfortable quarterdeck chair observed a couple of men
a little before noon stagger with sweating faces out of the galley, bearing
in their bands a sort of little wooden washing tub which sent up a great
deal of steam. This she knew was the crew's dinner. She had some
times wondered how they ate; whether they spread a tablecloth, whether
they planted a cruet-stand in their midst and placed knives and forks on
either hand for the hearts to cut and come again? Who carved? She sup.
posed the boatswain took the head of* the table. She had never felt so cu
rious, however, in this matter as to ask questions, and as, moreover, she
had not caught so much as a glimpse of the interior of the crew's dwell
ing-house she had figured into conviction a comfortable little: sea parlor
in which the men dined just as she and Glew and the mates and her father
did. After all, she mused, keeping her hands clasped upon her open
book, with her eves fastened upon the sailors' house, it is the monotony
of the sea that repels. It must have its good side. / Plenty to eat and
drink, and, as father says, most of the wonders of the world, islands,
harbors, inland scenes of beauty to be visited at the cost of others.
While she was thus moralizing she beheld a head with a very savage
â and malicious look upon its face in the deckhouse doorway; tbe figure of
the man was exposed to the waist and two great hands grasped for sup
port each side of the opening. It was the head of the boatswain of the
schooner, James Jones, carpenter and second mate, Dut as second mate he
had never been called upon to serve. He was uncovered and his hair was
wild His expression was devilish. Though at some distance from the
man the young lady could clearly distinguish a look of fury upon the sea.
man's face, as though he had just slain a shipmate and was in the act of
leaping on deck.
He stood in the doorway and continued to stare aft. Miss Vanderholt
glanced uneasily at the skylight. She waited for her father and Captain
Glew to pear. The captain was bound to arrive in a minute or two,
for already Mr. Tweed, who had glanced at the boatswain without ap
pearing to see anything unusual in the man's fixed half-in half-out pos
ture and dark endeviled face, had picked up his sextant and was ogling
. the sun. -y//~.07 : ; v . ' ;;//;; -yy;
Mr. Vanderholt was the first of the two to come on deck. His daush
ter called to him softly and said: "Father/did you ever see in all your
life snch a wicKed expression as that man wears?"
"What man? ' exclaimed Mr. Vanderholt, lancing bis teeth with a
silver toothpick and gazing along the decks with an expression of bland
benevolence. - \/y Xj
"That man there in the door of the galley ," said the girl. "He's
been standing like that for the last three or four minutes, hatless, looking
aft,, with that face of fury, as if they tied him in the doorway and were
goading him." . ../":
"I certainly see a man in the doorway," said Mr. Vanderholt, who
was a little short-sighted. "Does he look angry He spoke somewhat
uneasily and ned his head to see if the captain was on deck.
Glew at that moment rose through the hatch armed with his sextant.
Vanderholt went up to him and said:
"There is a man leaning in the door of the caboose now I look again
I see it is the boatswainâ whose face, my daughter/ tells me, is formidable
with temper. Ido not clearly see all that way off. I hope it will mean ,
no fresh trouble about the stores. Lit them know I have ordered pieces/;
of the pork and beef to be boiled for our midday meal."
While he was speaking' Glow's eyes/were fixed upon the boatswain,
who at ; the moment Vanderholt ceased, withdrew. Glew's attitude
was immediately and sensibly charged with malice and danger, with pas
. sions quickly growing and contending by the odd crouching air he carried
while he had watched the boatswain and 'listened to his employer.
"That James," he said, "is the right sort of a forecastle scoundrel to
breed a mutiny, and if be troubles me to-day we must have him out of it
Mr. Vanderholt, in the approved old method.* Mr. Tweed, can you lay ' -
your hands readily upon a set of irons for that fellow?"
The mate answered: "The carpenter has charge of the irons, sir, and
the carpenter is, unfortunately, boatswain himself."
â¢ "Go forward," said Captain Glew, "and ask the man to"give yon a set
of irons."
"Stop!" exclaimed Mr. Vanderholt, glancing at the helmsman, whose
eyes were upon Glew and who was clearly a listener. :" We must have no
talk of irons in this vessel until something has been done to warrant their
introduction." - s ' -
"If there should come a difficulty," was the captain's answer, "we
may find it impossible to get forward so as to procure the irons. I like to
be beforehand."
"I'll not have it," said Mr. Vanderholt with warmth.
Captain Glew simply said, "Ay, ay, sir," and turned his face, to the
sun with'his sextant uplifted.
Now it was that the boatswain reappeared, still without his hat, his
head very shaggy, his shirt sleeves rolled above his bows, disclosing the \
muscles of a cart horse. He sprang in a single bound through the door of
the deckhouse, grasping a messkid. - The seaman .named Dabb followed ;
he, too, grasped a mesiskid.. Then l" a,U the rest of the crew appeared, Gor
don. Allan, Toole, Scotland Maul. ..--Â».
"Now. bullies, are we ready?" exclaimed Jones in a voice of thunder,
and he put trie kid upon the deck. Dabb did likewise.
"Hurrah for a hot male of mate for the cabin," shouted Simon Toole.
The boatswain and Dabb,* each man in- his boots, kicked; they kicked
at the kids with all their might, and the wooden vessels cable rushing aft .
to the very feet of Captain Glew and Mr. Vanderholt, scattering their
precious contents of pork arid pea soup over the smooth planks.
Never was an uglier affront offered to the master of a ship. -Never had
mutinous insolence ; been cart led to a greater height. Captain Glow turned '
. white as milk, but not with fear. Well for him had he felt fear. Mr. Van
derholt was ashy pale. ; : He* called to his daughter to go below. She sprang
up, but instead of going below,' went and stood right aft, beside the helms
man, to whom she said: /''What do these men want?''
"Their rights," answered/he, with a diabolical leer.
The frightened girl made a/ quick ; step to the companion hatch, and
stood beside the cover; she was afraid to go below.

He was interrupted by Captain Glew roaring out, "Tweed, help me to
put that scoundrel in irons," and he rushed forward, Tweed following.
'.'Oh, my God cried Mr. Vanderholt. ' "Stay your hands, men; this
is my ship. lam master here. I'll see your wrongs righted."
"There'll be murder?" shrieked Miss Vanderholt.
--"Go below, for God's sake!" roared the distracted man, and catching
hold of his daughter's arm he dragged her down the steps into the cabin.
"No man in this ship puts me in irons," said the boatswain, showing
his teeth as he squared up at Captain Glew, with his immensely thick
aims covered with hair, arrows and crucifixes. "I've been wanting the
killing of you this many a day, you rat, and as you men hear me, by the
living Lord I'll kill him if he lays a finger upon me." "* 5 /V-.-^^^Â«fi
For a few minutes Captain Glew paused, waiting for Mr. Tweed, who
' had disappeared. He stood one man to seven; his nostrils dilated; his
eyes were on fire; his skin was a ghastly white and his fingers worked
like those of one who plays a piano. His breath flew from him in sharp,
quite audible hissings. He was the incarnation of wrath, fiendish above
anything human, and in that pause most of the men who met his gaze
seemed to quail. rf * < ' - ,
Mr. Vanderholt came running from the companion hatch. His right

Mr. Tweed came along from the forecastle, grasping an iron bar with

Toole's eyes /were on the captain at the instant and the ruffian saw

man's mouth. * . *â¢ 'â â '-â  *

"Drag me out of the sun," : muttered the captain. . ;' .
. "Mike, len's a hand," called Dabb, and quite gently these two seamen,
who were list now devils, carried the captain aft into the shelter of the
awning, where they left him to lie and expire/with 1 ; the - union jack rolled
up as a pillow. \
"1 never wanted it. I never wanted it," suddenly broke out the
boatswain in a deep groaning voice. "This isa swinging matter. What's
to be done? It's a damnation" to our souls. Why couldn't ye have let
the old Dutchman be?" !;" <X* ;. .*. / â 
"His pistol was full cock on you, Jim, when I let fly," answered Maul.
"He's only stunned. .'. Hasn't/a man a right to fight for his life? Look at
them barrels," he added, pointing to the revolver.
"Here comes his daughter," exclaimed Gordon,
y Miss Vanderholt was. standing in the. companion way. She wore a ;
straw hat and her eyes, under the shadow of the brim and under the fluff
of hair about her brow, looked twice their usual sizeâ strained, un win ;
ing, blind with sudden dreadful amazement, but brilliant as light also
with horror and terror. She came out of the. hatch slowly. L*gg at the
helm, with a note of commiseration, said: "He's only been knocked down.
. He shouldn't have got massing about with firearms among a mob of angry
men." She did not hear him, or, if she did, she did not heed him.
She went straight to her father, making alow, wailinsor moaning
noise as she walKed. The boatswain exclaimed: "No harm was intended
to him, Miss. 'Twas him that shot Mr. Tweed."
She looked closely into her father's 'ace. He lay on hij back, staring,
with wl.ie eyes half open up at the sky. tie had fallen as though shot
through the heart. A great livid weal, dreadful to see, blackened and
lifted his brow. ; A little blood, that had trickled from one ear lay glazed
close beside the gray hair of his whiskers.
"Is he dead?" she asked, looking around at the men and speaking in
a voice sunk with fear. '
"Let's carry him aft to his cabin. It's not right the young lady should
see him lying there," said Gordon. y
f Thereupon Gordon, Allan and Jones picked the body rip and bore him
I aft. followed by Miss Vanderholt, who often staggered as she walked.
They got him into a cabin and put him down upon a sofa.
Â* "An ugly job," said one of the seamen.
"Who did it?" the girl asked.
The men made no answer. .
"Oh. father," she cried, trembling violently; then dropping upon ber
knees beside him she be. an to free his throat. "He may only be stunned,"
she said. â¢ - "*;â "' Xy-mXyyX'mj'^
"You'll please to recollect this," said on* of the men. "He comes
rushing along with a pistol to shoot us with, and the motive was to strike
the revolver out of his hand before he could send a second shot. 'It was
him that killed the mate," and the speaker wheeled on his naked feet and
went to the companion ladder. He was almost immediately followed by
the others.;' â *..*>:;" '-'â â "
The girl ran to the cabin and fetched a bowl, into which she splashed
cold water .rom a decanter, and for a quarter of an hour she ceaselessly
bathed her father's face and head. He n.-ver stirred. -y She could not find
his pulse, though she sought for it with trembling fingers about his wrists.

"Why,'' aimed Dabb, 'sending a pair of drink-stained eyes slowly 1
;. traveling over little ship, "I'm bum ptd, mates, if there's e'er a navi
gator in the vessel."
At this jane: ure Toole and N Jones stepped over to the body of the
mate and carried him to the" side of the captain, whose form they bent
over. The ooatswain went down upon his knees and looked with a face
of hate and horror at the countenance of the/ dead man. This was a
picture to handsomely symbolize one large old red tradition of the mer
chant service. Art there any Clews left ? 1 So Jong as they remain in com- 1
mand, so long will they prove the solvers of ; the so-called mysteries of the
oceanthe abandoned ship, the boatload of men whose statements differ, !
the stranded body with the wound in its throat. : 'y. /. '
'These men are dead," says the boatswain, standing up. "No use in
letting 'em he here to shock the woman should she come on deck. Get
'em covered up and we'll bury 'em this afternoon."
Toole fetched a small tarpaulin and hid the oodles.
."How's" the Dutchman getting on, I wonder? 'said. the boatswain.
:', He went to the open skylight and looked down. He saw the figure of
Mr. Vanderholt lying stiff in/death on a sofa locker; his daughter sat
beside him inclined forward, ' resting her chin in her bands, while the
boatswain watched, as stirless as the dead.
y The seaman stepped back and walked forward slowly. The sailors,
Scott excepted, were gathered about the deckhouse door, holding a council
upon their condition and prospects. There was a hurry of nerve in their
speech, and again one or another would look ahead or on either bow ;
The boatswain, sieving in among them, said in his deep voice:
"I'm for getting something to eat. ''/-.â¢ I want my diuner.""
"And I'm for gelling something to drink," -aid Tuole.
The boatswain picked un Mr. Vanderholt's revolver, and while he ex
.-â  amined it before pocketing it, he said: "There's no chances of my bossing

"There's no call to keep all on/Jim," said Dab 6. "We don't want to

turning to Gordon, 1 "you know the ropas aft. Bring something for'rad
from the Dutchman's pantry fit for the men to sit down to." â¢
"Am Ito bring any drink?" san Gordon. // ,
"What have they got down there?" asked Maul.,

"Bring eight bottles for* rads," said the boatswain. "Joe, go you along

Gordon and Dabb walked aft and disappeared down the companion
hatch.' The others trudged about their deckhouse door, passing and re
â passing each other short lookout walks, their heads sunk, their backs
bowed and their hands plunged deep in their breeches pockets.
After some time Gordon and the other arrive with their arms full of
bottles of beer and preserved meats and delicate cabin eatables out of tha
pantry. It was broiling hot. Mike Scott at the helm bawled to them to
bring him a ' bottle. Maul took him one, and 'â 'â  he swilled .he foam
ing draught down out of a pannikin in a sort of dance of ecstasy.
"What's t:.e young woman a-doing of?" asked the boatswain, follow

"She was sitting by her father's body when we entered. She jumps
up as if she had - been stabbed, and says in & little shriek, 'What do you

swarmed into the deckhouse. s "Maul took aim at the pistol, and never
meant to kill him." '-^jaMj^k' â  '''â '''.
They were hungry and thirsty, a rough, red-banded mob of seamen.
They sat down upon their chest and ate and drank, one- taking a plate

IDYLS OF THE FILED
TfT^YING at full length upon my back
-ij^k under a thicket of close-growing
mes^p osiers I was studying through the
- tieldglass a newcomer among ray
feathered neighbors, when something
buzzed past my face, brushing against my
hair as it did so.
I thought it was a large moth or a but
terfly; the warm week of sunshine has
brought both these out in great numbers, i
and 1 paid no attention, so engrossed was
lin my observations. Still the creature
hovered about mv head with a beating of !
wings that, had I given heed to, I should
have recognized, but not until a flash of |
brilliant color darted across my vision did i
I glance away from the glass. Then I saw |
that the mite that was inspecting me quite
as curiously as I was watching his big
brother was a brilliant little humming
â bird. I gave a start of surprise and he
i was off, but I could see him gleaming j
jewel- among the foliage of the grease
wood close at hand. It was the Anna
hummer, one of the most brilliant of all
these beautiful little birds. The Anna
hummer belongs exclusively to California.
He is rather larger than the Eastern ruby
throat, which he somewhat resembles.
This was a male bird, with a head like a
gleaming ruby, a metallic red and purplish
coat and a green vest brave trappings
these in which to goa-wooing. Every year
I am sure there wiil be at least one pair
of these humming-birds nestling in a
tangle of sweetbrier here beside the stream.
Whether they are the same pair, return
ing year after year, I cannot say, but they
are very tame. I have known one to fly
into the midst of a group of people and
flutter about a speaker's face with tho
same familiar curiosity that marked this
one's inspection of me.
The humming-bird and the least fly- j
catcher are the only wild birds I have
ever -observed who , do not take instant!
' fright at the "sound "of the human t' voice. '
The barking of a dog, the neighing of a I
.horse, the mewing of a cat, all sounds ]
closely connected with humanity, do not j
alarm the birds. They will listen atten- j
tively if you whistle to them, but make !
an articulate sound and they are off. Ido
not know why this should be. It is not
very complimentary tons.
The bird I was watching, when my tiny
visitor claimed attention, was the ruby
crowned kinglet, a beautiful little creature
whom, until this spring, I have never no
ticed in this vicinity. This year I have
â¢ seen two, both males. The birds are about
the size of the goldfinch, with upper parts
of dark oiive-green, dusky wings and tail,
tipped with yellow, two whitish bars
across his wings and a brilliant dash
of red in his crown. I have not heard
them sing here, save to utter a half-whis
pered, warbling sort of twitter, among the
willows, but the bird has the reputation,
in the East, of being a brilliant songster.
They are only birds of passage with us,
however, paying us a brief visit on their
way to the mountains, where they build
their nests and rear their young.
* We are just now in the full height of
our spring, season, and the recent warm'
days have brought the flowers out in
earnest. In some one of his pleasant
essays John Burroughs takes the poets to
task for making buttercups and dande
lions bloom at the same time. The dan
delions he declares to be a full month
later than the buttercup. They are out
before the buttercups here, however, and
our Californian poets may make them
neighbors with no fear of offending
mother nature. The blue-eyed grass is in
bloom now. This is another blossom that
seems to differ in its habits from its
Eastern sister. Our blue-eyed grass may
be gathered, and will, if placed in water,
last for several days, to cheer and comfort
its human friends, but the Eastern flower
droops and dies almost as soon as it is
severed from* its root. The blue-eyed
grass is really a lily, and with us most of
this family last well- if placed in water.
Anagal.s, the pretty wee pimpernel, is also
in blossom, dotting the young meadows
with its friendly little red flowers.
The pimpernel is an exceedingly lova
ble little weed. It does no harm in a field
and it* has such a happy, cheerful faculty
of getting a living out of the barest,
brown, . sun-baked clods of earth. The
mallows are blooming in great abundance
on the sunny uplands and in low, marshy
places, and I know a hilltop that is just
now carpeted with yellow violets. These
flowers seem to love the wind-swept moun
tain tops and to flourish where scarcely
another thing can find a roothold. The
brodiasa, too, is purpling the hillsides, and
lupin and poppies make the meadows and
roadsides to bloom like fair gardens. The
popples hereabouts are by no means plen
tiful, however. If; people are not more
careful I fear the time will come when
they will be rare indeed. I rarely take
my walks abroad during these days that I
do not come upon forlorn masses of these
blossoms, ruthlesdy ' plucked and after
ward left in the road to die. The veriest
weeds would not flourish under these con
ditions, nor will our r poppies, do so for
ever. I know a lover of flowers who makes
a point of carrying packages of the seed
with him on his walks and scattering
them In waste places where flowers do not
appear. Ido not know why this is not a
desirable course to pursue with" reference
to many of our wild flowers.
Climbing up a steep bank the other day,
I came upon a;â¢ bed of ' .tell, nodding
flowers/the shooting star. Sinking upon
my knees ; beside them, the wide pano
rama of foothills and valley, the distant
ci'^sand the broad blue bay faded; from
view. The years ' slipped from -my
shoulders and I was once more a child in :
an Eastern meadow, wandering amid the
â¢'white weed" and clover, and stopping,
thrilled with delight, to touch and gloat
over a single shooting star growing at my
feet. It was always an event in the sum
mer, the finding of this flower. Other
events grouped themselves about it.
After that I remembered things as hap
pening the day or the week before or
after I "found the shooting star." Noth
ing else ever happened on that day. There
was nothing left to happen. The event
was supreme. So deeply impressed upon
my memory is the rarity of this plant In
our western New York meadows that
California's beautiful abundance of blos
soms has not yet accustomed me to re
gard it as common.
I cherish the lovely, eerie flowers when
I find them as though I knew I should
not see another throughout the season.
"Wild cyclamen," it is called hereabouts,
but it is really .the meadow cowslip, the
dodecatheron of the Greeks. "Twelve
gods," the name means. Those old GreeKs
and Romans were full of poetry and the
hard-sounding Attic and Latin nomen
clature of our botanists is often more beau
tifully expressive than our English names
for the plants. This little chickweed here
at my feet, for instance, is called, in Latin,
trientalis, because it usually grows the
third part of a foot in height. The reason
seeips a little far-fetched, but why should
we call the little plant chickwee l.and why
should the common name of the beautiful
' cyclamen itself be anything so hideous as
1 "sow-bread"?.
Now that the honey-making flowers are
really in blossom the busy bee* are busy
indeed. I opened a hive the other day
and peeping in saw that the waxen combs
are rapidly filling. Incidentally I per
formed for tbe hive a service always
gives me an indefinable sense of sympa
thetic regret. From the floor, underneath
the combs, I scraped nearly half a pint of
dead bees. The hive. seemed in no way
depleted. The workers came and went
busily in the sunshine, and all seemed
well with the colony, but there were the
bees that had died of old age. Some
wera not yet, dead, but struggled feebly
from the mass as they were brushed out
into the light and warmth. The first bees
in this hive came away from the parent
hive last June in the heyday of youth,
when warm weather started the honey
flowing and stirred the swarming instinct
in their blood. They were pioneers form
ing a new colony. All summer long they
toiled, building the combs now, ready to
be filled and rearing a young brood to
take their places. Through the bright
winter days they went far afield for sup
plies. During the heavy rains they busied
themselves inside, constructing the won
derful cells that a fortnight hence will
hold the golden sweetness of the flowers.
Then, their labor done, before they had
seen its full fruition, in the bright pleas
ant spring days they lay down and died.
The young bees of the colony, like the
young people of the human race, will
reap the benefit of their labors. Those
who laid the foundations for the after
work will never see the rich hcney stored
in the combs. They sowed, but others

their successors. There is no accumula
tion of private fortunes in the hive, no
monopolies, no trusts, but each toils for
all and lays down the burden only when
its allotted span of life is ended. The
length of a bee's life depends largely upon
the amount of work it has to do. I have
somewhere seen its natural duration for a
worker bee stated at ten months, but from
the quantities of dead bees swept from the
hive I feel sure that at least two genera
tions perished in -the upbuilding of the
streets of comb ranged so accurately in

Most Novel Method of Obtaining Energy
/lir Expansion by Means of the Vibratory Impulses Derived
From the X j^ay
Y'Â£Yr<OW often do we pause and gaze
1"^-/ with admiration upon the working
JL^i^ of a steam engine. The beautiful
piece of mechanism never fails to enchant
us with its complex yet harmonious
motion. It is a familiar spectacle and yet
but few who look upon it really under
stand how it operates; how the energy is
created and applied. Not one in a hun
dred persons could explain that the rhyth
mical motion of the numerous parts was
produced by the expansion of steam ad
mitted through a valve into the cylinder
where it pushes the piston head to the
further end, where another valve, opened
just at the right instant, admitted new
steam that pushed the piston back again;
the alternate opening and closing of the
valves being accomplished by the to and
fro movement of the piston.
Steam is a gas, and, like all other gases,
expands when it is heated, and it is the
application of this well-known principle
that operates the engine. All gases are I
S composed of molecules in a state of per
| manent repulsion; the molecules may be
compared to springs constantly bent, and
making constant effort to free themselves.
Tho amount of pressure which these mole
cules exert against the sides of the vessels
which contain them depends upon the
volume or space which they occupy. So
that a given quantity of gas exerts a
greater pressure in a smaller than in a
larger vessel. Heat and cold play very
mportant parts in determining the condi
tions and powers (expansive force) of
gases. he molecules of the gas are kept
from disassoclation by cold, while their
struggle for separation is aided by heat.
The bursting of a boiler is due to the
enormous expansion of the gaseous steam
produced by the furnace fires.
A number of distinguished scientists
have devoted patient research and experi
ment to the phenomenon of the expansion
whelmingly the masculine favorite, it is
by. ; no means a general feminine favorite.
The favorite woman's color, standing at
the head of the female list, is red. Roughly
speaking, of every 30 N masculine < votes,
10 would' be for bine and 3 for red; while
of -very '30 feminine votes, 4 /would be
for ; blue and 5 for/ red. Red and blue are
thus more nearly equally popular among
women than among men. Other relatively
marked! masculine preferences are for. the
colors ". related to blue (blue violet and
violet) and other feminine preferences are
for lighter red, or pink, and to a less ex
tent, for green and yellow. * Further, men
confine their selections ;to relatively
fewer colors than do women; and finally
while all men and women alike are much
more apt to choose a normal than a tran
sitional color and a darker than a lighter
shade, yet the tendency to do so about
the same in - the former direction is
markedly different; in the latter respect;
of a dozen men, 10 would choose among
the darker colors and only two among the
lighter for the most pleasing color: while
of a dozen women, seven would choose
among the darker and five among the
lighter shades. This feminine fondness for
the lighter and daintier shades appears
also in other respects.
Passing next to the discussion of the
preferences among the combination of
colors enumerated above, the first note
worthy result is that no combination of
colors occupies the position of a decided
favorite as did blue among the single
colors, but that preferences for the several
combinations vary gradually from the
most to the least favorite. The two most
frequently and about equally preferred
combinations are red with violet and red
with blue, which are somewhat similar
in effect (the violet being very dark in ap
pearance); more than one-fifth of all the
J persons contributing to the results choose
of gases, and one of the results of their
labors is the establishment of the fact that
gases expand their volume a certain fixed
amount for each degree of increased tem
perature. This is expressed by the term
"coefficient of expansion," and means the
increase of the volume for each degree
centigrade. The working of our engine,
therefore, depends upon the expansion of
the steam-gas, and we would conclude that
increased power of expansion would give
increased dynamic force or engine-power,
which is the fact.
We have learned that beat is the agent
which aids the separation of the molecules,
and so we employ it to expand- the gas.
Atmospheric air expands .003665 for each
additional degree of applied heat. Steam,
which is mostly hydrogen, expands about
the same, its coefficient of expansion being
.003656.' '.'-;>/

. conclusionsâ that what is heat, as appre
ciable to us, is nothing but motion, sim
ply molecules vibrating at a certain rate
of speed. .
The conclusion is evident that, if by
some other means than the application
of actual heat we may be able to aid the
separation of the molecules of a gas, as
steam, . we may then be able to produce
the expansion of the gas in an available
form of energy or power. That this is
capable of accomplishment by vibration
is an accepted fact, for vibration is proved
by the investigations of Tyndall and oth
ers to be but another form of heat, or, to
express it properly, heat is vibration.
Within the few years last past some very
important modifications of previous ideas
have taken place, due to the extension of
our knowledge about physics. Recent dis
coveries in electricity have opened to our
senses conditions in .that branch of en
ergy hitherto undreamed of. The last dis
covery, that of the "X" ray, has conferred
most valuable information upon the mys
tical subject of electrics. Of the full na
ture of the ray, its complete conditions
and powers, we are, as yet, unaware; but
already know that it must consist of mat
ter in the highest rate of vibration cogniz
able to our physical sense. It is believed
by many competent to pass opinion that
the ray is capable of exciting intense
vibration in such other forms of matter as
may be under proper conditions subjected
to its influence, y ///;"/
Based upon these logical deductions, a
prominent inventor is now at work upon
the construction of an expansive air en
gine, the operation of which is accom
plished by the use of air expanded to an
enormous tension by means of the vibra
tory impulses derived from the X ray. It
will not do at the present day to ridicule
any announcement Jike this. Experience
daily teaches us that the " inventive
crank" of yesterday has become the wor
shiped king of to-day. Science emphati
cally declares "that - all gases are com-,
posed of molecules in a state of permanent
repulsion," and, further, that these mole
; cules are possessed of electrical character
istics and are susceptible of magnetic at
traction and repulsion; so the proposition
to employ the X ray as an excitant is both
rational and promisingly practical. Of
course, there are numerous details con
nected with the employment of this novel
mode of procuring energy, which will have
to be carefully studied out, but they are
all within the field of well-understood
mechanics, and present no insuperable
obstacles. It is the novel method of ob
taining energy â primal power, that is here
presented. F. M. Close, D.Sc. .

are hooked like, and when on duty in the
mouth of a full-grown and blooded
proprietor they ; have the power , to tear
things asunder in a most pitiless fashion.
Some of the Phcenix sports had an idea
they would like to see Tiger's hooks come
together on : the throat of Jose's -five
horned pet, not because they had any
thing in particular against the petâ no one
had but because Jose used to blow so
much about the fighting qualities of him.
So they tried several times to arrange a
match between the two brutes, but wnen
it came to the scratch Jose proved bash
ful and would not allow the match to take
place. He was making : a good thin.; by
exhibiting his freak at 10 cents a look,
with a fondle or two and the privilege of
feeding him peanuts thrown in, and ...he
protested that he didn't want to make his
pet unpopular by having him officiate as
executioner of the most popular bulldog
in the county. â¢ XX *.â ' '"-,_.
Of course the sports swore that Jose
was afraid to loso his .freak, and there the
matter -rested for a month or two, and
people began -to lose interest in the
strange animal. The gale -receipts fell
off, and by and by any one could see the
Mexican's pet for a bare piece of the shoe
leather it cost to loiter m front of the
Washington-street "banks" until Jose
and his freak came i out â for '. Jose was
strong on faro. When he played, how
ever, he always had his freak with him
for a mascot, and it is the opinion of sev
eral of the keenest Washington-street
dealers that the freak made a mascot
against which no bank could hold out.
In spite of all this, however, the god
dess did desert Jose upon one occasion â
the day before he left Phoenix and two
days before the now historic battle which
I am struggling to bring a tin? pen to
the point of narrating. And I may state,'
as well now as at any time, perhaps, that
there is tbe tanned hide of a large Dull
dog down at Gila Bend to attest the truth
fulness of every word that I am going to
utter about this fight
' When Jose left Phoenix he took his' mas
cot along with him, and this is probably
the only thing he did take except his
trousers, shirt, sombrero, blankets and
boots.' They were good boots and he had
use for them. , ,
When near the Gila Bend the mascot
and the Mexican came up with Hake and
Tirer. The meeting was somewhat unex
pected, and Tiger was loose. So was the
mascot. As this is very near the most ex
citing part of my story, it is propor that a
halt should be made long enough to ena
ble the reader to get into the confidence
of the author to the extent, at least, of
knowing that Tiger was the famous bull
dogâ was, 1 say, for he Is no longer â
against whom the Phoenix sports tried to
have the mascot fitted to a death battle.
And the owner of Tiger was willing
enough, for he had as much, if not more,
conceit in his animal than had Jose in
his freak.
Bat all that was long ago.* The scene is
changed from the gayeties of city life to
the heat , and quiet' of a desert ranch.
Four travelers Wero won ding their way
along a dusty road. They are in pairs,
and each pair is approaching the other â
approaching also a battle royal that the
Phcenix sports would have given their
eyes" to have witnessed.- The records are
inexact as to distance and time, but about
the main facts of the case there are no
disputes. All at once Tiger spied the
mascot and began to sniff the air. Jose
I and his pet came forward quite peacefully.
The freak is a , very wild-looking beast,
with a face as bland as the face of Ah Sin.
Only his queer horns have an ugly look,
but' at the same time they are so ponder
ous in appearance that one would expect
to find them rather an ' incumbrance in
battle.
; Well, the -distance shortened between
the approaching parties. Then, suddenly
there was a streak of dust about 100 feet
long stretching from Hake Nelson to the
Mascot. In much less than another sec
ond there was a bunch of dust where the
mascot had stood. And -when the dust
cleared away a little Hake and Jose could
see â and, alas, that the Phoenix sports
could not!â a big black and white bull
dog, almost limp and nearly dead, hang
ing by the neck between the two lower
horns on the left side of the freak's head.
. How the thing happened no one will
ever know to a nicety. But there was the
dog dying and there was tbe freak pan
ing, but still mild and bland. One of the
antlers had penetrated and torn the flesh
of poor Tiger, ; but /although the wound
bled freely it was not sufficient to have
caused the death that very shortly en
sued. Hake and Jose held an inquest then
and there and. their unanimous verd ct
was that Tiger came to his end by strang
ulation at 'â , the / handsâ or rather at the -
horns the' queerest animal ever seen in
Mariopa County. The jurors also exoner
ated the freak. They could have done no
less, for he was surely not the attacking -
party.
f X The dog's neck was â¢ wedged in tightly,
so that he could only be extracted by main
force. ;/. If the five-horned , freak ever goes
back to Phcenix the boys will crown him
laurel. Luke Nosth.

I\|' â  weather prophets bad better take
Is*^ in their shingles and enter the
ranks of the snow-shovelers or
sprinkling-cart drivers, for surely they
are, useless as the fortetellers of at
mospheric change and weather disturb
ances. For instance, we all trustingly
read in our morning newspaper that s "to
day j will do warm and fair, with rainfall
during the night." With tho guileless
faith of children we gayly trip downtown
in our prettiest, best attire, sans umbrellas,
sans overshoes and sans heavy wraps.
Invariably the wiseacre weather proohet
has told another of his mistakes, ana we
wade- back home through a couple of
inches of slushy snow or rain puddles, our
feathers drooping, our best attire bedrag
gled and our tempers anything but flowers
and sunshine. yy' y 'XX
Weather prophets are useless officials,
say 1, and the old vane on grandpa's barn
can tell more about the weather than the
bespectacled scientists who climb up into
lofty towers and consult a roomful of
atmospheric indicators and complicated
electric contrivances, every one of which
is out of order half the time.
New Yorkers have had their share of
profiting prophet's weather prophecies
during the past month; their predictions
concerning climatic changes have been all
on the wrong side; consequently the
Gothamites are losing that blind faith in
weather-farmers that they once had. ;
On Saturday the day was superb to look
at, but it was a different thing to get out
in. The wind blew at the rate of fifty
two miles an hour, . and silk hats, veils,
handkerchiefs and old papers went flying
and whirling down the streets like crazy
swarming bees. '
: The sun shone in splendor, the atmo
sphere was clear and the skies were
cloudless; nevertheless, they town was
covered with several inches of snow when
Sunday morning dawned, and the weather
prophet hadn't breathed a word of it to
any of us.

Frank Cline filed a libel against the British
tramp steamer Amarapoora ' yesterday for
$10,000 damages. ; '. Cline, in his complaint,
states that while at Antwerp he was hired by
the master, William; D. \ Cameron, to fill the
position of ship's steward." Articles tor a
twelvemonths' cruise were ngned on Feb
ruarys, 1890. The vessel went to Hongkong,
Kobe, and, then to Seattle. At that port Cline
asserts that the master discharged him and
drove him from the vessel, although by the
agreement Cline should be returned to some
port i in the United Kingdom. The principal
causes of complaint, however, are based upon
personal damages. â â Cline as-erts that on the
voyage he wt.s degraded in rank from steward
to coal passer and compelled to sleep in the
pigpen on tic exposed deck; also, that while
operating a wrench he was thrown between
two exposed steam pipes, which burned his
legs so badly that he has been damaged to the
amount suedjfor. "MINES
& MINERS
jFIfoLASKA will hold a great place in the :
>lss\ a' attention of the mining world this
Af^AJ year. The big "rush" for its gold
fields which has-been forming during the
winter is now on. end every steamer from
Puget Sound ports is overloaded with gold
seekers and their outfits. Estimates on the
number of men who will push into the re
gion vary from 5000 to twice that number.
The great majority of* these thousands will
be men of little or no mining experience, who
expect to prospect ana work some oi the new
Yukon diggings. But besides these there will
he a vastly increased influx of capital and of
experienced mining men, whose attention
will be given to the development of the ex
tensive quartz deposits along the coast, which
are of low i:rade, but extensive and, little ex
plored. Hydraulic ope rations on a large scale
will also be .begun in the rich field above
Cooks Inlet.
Altogether Alaska will see this year a great
boom in gold mining, a considerable increase
of prod action over the $4,000,000 or so pro
duced last year and discoveries and develop
ments Which will make progressive future in
crease certain. . y-'y-p
This mining development will, of course,
hi>'en the permanent growth and develop
ing: of Alaska in other ways, giving popula
te, capital end enterprise, hastening the
exploration of the great region, the establish
ment of territorial government and so on.
Alaska la a great" new mining region, des
tined to become one of j the important ones of
the world, aud it will afford a world of inter
Â«sting' features as its development goes on.
It has characteristics and conditions of its
own, and will present problems and methods
of its own. . This is especially true of the Yu
kon region, which is spread over a large terri
tory on both sides of the Arctic circle, hun
dreds of miies inland, difficult of access and
with ground that never thaws. Sp^SPfififl
The recent reports of the fabulously rich dis
coveries en the Klondeik River and its tribu
taries, added to the knowledge of the richness
of the placer fields before known, have been
the chief cause of the great rush ol this year.
The developments of quartz mining along the
coast will be overshadowed in public interest
by the placer diggings of the Yukon, whither
the human tide is rushing. The stories that
float out of this region include some of $100
and $126 to the pan, but these are undoubt
edly wild exaggerations.
While this region continues to be known as
the Alaskan fields', the new and richest discov
eries are across the line in the British North-'
uÂ«t Territory: The most populous diggings
have heretofore been about the junction of
the Yukon River, the boundary line and the
Arctic dircle, but mainly in American terri
tory. Hereon the Yukon, close to the circle
and a few miles from the boundary, is Circle
City, the metropolis of the region, with a pop
ulation of 2000 or so. Here is Birch Creek,
which has yielded dust, and not far down the
river-is the mouth of th* Porcupine. yvJ-y
In American territory and within seventy
miles of Circle City are the tributaries of
Birch Creek, which afforded the principal
placer diggings of last year and the one before
âDeadwood, Greenhorn, Independence, Mas
todon and Eagle creeks. Forty-mile Creek,
near the mouth of which gold was first dis- ,
covered .in 1888, flows northward through
American territory and just crosses the bound
ary line, a.-, its location is now understood, to
l:eech the Yukon, at Fort Cudahy. ,
m But the most recent and the richest dis
coveries have been made during the past sum
mer and fall up the Yukon fifty miles or so
into British territory, and thither the tide has
turned. Last August a prospector struck it
rich in the bed of the Klondeik, a stream
emptying into the Yukon from the north,
about sixty miles un from the boundary.
Other discoveries and a rush followed. Next
rich discoveries were made on Bonanza and
Hunker creeks, small tributaries of the Klon
deik near its mouth. Smaller creeks â¢ and
capyons, all included in a region within
twenty-five miles of the mouth of the Klon
deik, are rewarding prospectors.
One of the most reliable reports on these new
fields has just come to the Mining and Scien
tific Press from a young mining engineer,
Byron Â£. Janes, who writes from Forty-mile
under date of January 21. In speaking of
Bonanza Creek, he says:
'â¢One of the richest claims has a pay Ptreax
thirty feet wide of three feet of bedrock and
, four feet of gravel, which will average, it is
claimed, $1 to the pan, but I think 50 cents is
nearer to it For two miles each way from this
claim good pay has been located at close in
tervals: Hunker Creek has not been pros
pected much yet, but will doubtless have some
good claims. Bonanza Creek is about twenty
five miles long, and on it and Its tributaries,
there arc located probably 400 claims of 500
feet each, and half that many in Hunker dis
trict. Of that number some Will never pay,
many will pay wages and perhaps a little more,
and a goodly number will give their owners
snug sums. The prevailing wages of the
country are $1 per hour." 5
So the Yukon gold diggings are extending
southeastward into British territory, and the
development is tending to close the gap be
tween the mining field of Alaska and the Brit
ish Columbia fields, which are growing north
ward with so much excitement and success.
Tbe mining future of this vast portion of the
continent seems limitless, the gold belt, of
which little glints here and there ere seen,
stretching into the frigid zone and bending
westward into the waters of Bering Sea.
The placer diggings are naturally holding all
attention, for it must be years before discov
er and development of the quartz veins from
witch has come this placer gold. The country,
hundreds of miles in the interior, behind a
mountain range, is a barren, frozen mass and
covered, and presenting insuperable dif
ficulties to quartz mining. X-^st\*9Â»SwÃS^
The .past i winter has developed an entirely
new and novel method of placer- mining. In
the brief summer the creekbeds never thaw
but a short distance below the surface, and
most of the year the water is frozen up. ;So
this winter ingenuity developed the method
of tbswing the frozen ground with fire, thus
drifting out the gravel under the frozen creeks
and piling it up to be washed during the three
summer months when water could be used.
By this novel plan work is pursued the year,
round, though gravel must ba rich to pay for
working in this slow, way, with the tempera
ture at from 10 to 65 degrees below zero ' and
all supplies at fabulous prices. ' .
The little-heeded -warning is constantly re
peated by every authority, that no man should
start for the Yukon without a rugged consti
tution to endure hardships and at least $500
besides his outfit. Hundreds of .those ,who
are starting for the perilous trip of hundreds
of miles across ; the mountains will suffer un
told hardships during i the coming winter,
when flr.ur will doubtless again be $10 a sack,
as it i 3 now", provisions ; scarce at any price,
and nothing to be had except for cash. -
The general appropriation bill es finally
passed by the Lecislaturc, in which the appor
tionment of $50,000' to the Mining Bureau for
'â¢ the two years Is restored, maintains this insti
tution on the same financial basis as that of
tte past two years, and the new. State miner
'.sfiogist -will assume oflice on \ the first of I the
x| onth with a fairly adequate supply of mouey.
For. the rest of : this fiscal year and during
this season the bureau will be operated on
about the same lines as formerly,' and the sea
son's field work has begun. of the most
valuable portions of the work will probably be
the geological survey of a section of the south
ern coast region just begun by Harold W. Fair
banks, who ;is eminently qualified for the
work. sUnder special contract he will make an
economic geological investigation of a section
of country about twenty-five miles wide and
seventy-five miles long, beginning at the
chrome deposits a few miles north of the town
of , San Luis Obispo, and extending southward
to the Santa Barbara field already explored.
His survey will have special reference to oil,
asphalt, building stones and subterranean
water supplies, and will undoubtedly give im
portant economic and scientific results. "...
W. L. Watts is working in the Ventura
County oil region continuing the valuable
work he has been engaged in for a good while."
In a short time two other men will take the
field. F. C. Mathyas will go over the northern
coast region from Napa and , Sonoma counties,
through Mendocino and Humboldt counties,
the western part of Trinity and Del Norte and
Siskiyou counties, reporting on the mines and
the mineral resources of that ' region. E. B.
Preston will put in the season on. like work
through the gold region of the Sierra slopes
north ot Mariposa. Messrs. Watts, Mathyas
and Preston are thus continued on the staff of
field deputies for this season. W. K. Storms
retires to superintend a mine in Tuolumne
County, and J. H. Means also retires, though
he may do some tfork in the Randsburg re
gion by special contract These two vacancies
will be filled by Mr. Cooper and the applica

George W. Grayson has bought the Brown
Bear quartz mine on Salmon River, Siskiyou
County, from Golden & Eveleth, and will de

Lively times ln mining may be anticipated
during the coming soring and summer around
and near Yreka. The old Espy claim and
pumping machinery are now in successful oper
ation under control of Hunter & Simmons,
who have already piped off more than an acre
of ground since starting iheir mammoth pump
at Shasta River. Several good claims have
been located on Shasta River below the elec
tric-light plant in Fool's Paradise District
and all the old claims are to be worked with
renewed energy at Hawkinsville, Long Gulch,
Canal Gulch and other localities north of town.
On the west side of town several claims will be
worked on Humbug Gulch, Greenhorn Gulch,
Portuguese Gulch, Spring Gulch and other
gulches, while south of town the rich claims
on Greenhorn Creek are being opened again.

The Trinity Mining and Mining Company,
having its office at 56 Nevada block, San

Charles H. Fish as president and J. Stadtfeld
Jr. as secretary. The properties to be operated
are the Trinity Consolidated mines in Dog
Creek mining district. It has long been known
that these mines possessed great value, but
for want of sufficient capital and machinery
have heretofore been worked in a desultory
manner. In the early 60' s this camp produced
great quantities, of placer gold, but until
lately quartz mining has not received much
attention there.â Weaverville Free Press.

The Evening Telegraph of Philadelphia is
just now doing the high kicking act * for no
cause. In a recent issue it pays the executive
committee of the American Whist League a
back-banded "pivot blow" compliment for
doing, what In our opinion, is the best work
that has ever been done by the executive com:
mittee in regard to arranging its schedule of
contests for the annual congress since the
league came into existence. The Telegraph
says:
The main topic of discussion of the day in whist
circles is the very surprising action of the league
directorate at the Nashville meeting in deciding
upon a plan of play for the Hamilton trophy i con
test at the next congress, which, In the opinion of
most whlsters, j Is far less Conclusive than many
other methods that have been tried and suggested.
. The real trouble probably Is the fool Ith decision
of the directors in selecting an out of tbe way place
like Nashville for a meeting. Of course the choice
was made out of compliment to one of j the most
popular of the members of the board, but that does
not excuse or justify It, and the Inevitable result was
that a number of the most experienced, able and
level-beaded directors were absent, men who had"
' they been on hand, we feel . sure, would have seen
the objections to tbe plan adopted and Insisted on
some method, which' would ' cause the winners to
bave a reputation for skill rather than luck.
In commenting on the above, we will say we
agree with the Telegraph that Nashville was
an out-of-the way place to hold the midwinter
meeting, but it was the choice of the execu
tive committee at Manhattan Beach, and no one
seriously opposed It, and the distance to Nash
ville at the time was no greater tban It would
be in the following January. The plan of
play for the Hamilton trophy is the best be
yond a question . of - doubt tbat has ever yet
been adopted, and will prove so at the Put-in-
Bay congress. It is simply thisâ and what plan
could be better when you have only five days
in which to carry it out? Presuming that tbe

greater than they were at Brooklynâ and it is
not at all likely there will be so manyâ

woman is a few years younger, about the
same height and matronly in appearance.
She is always heavily veiled.. '-Â.
They both ; dress quietly and have the
appearance of well-to-do people from the
country. Their dress has been different
on the occasions when they visited the

woman. None of ' th* articles would suit
them, and they would leave, thanking the
salesman politely for his attention. After
they bad gone, it was always found that
they had taken one or two of the articles
with them. y yyX-x
Friday morning they entered the jew
elry-store of* 0. Biomquist, 112 Montgom

Bloraquist's salesman, an old man. They
asked him to show them some diamond
earrings, as they had come to town to buy
a present for their daughter.
The salesman laid a tray of diamond
earrings on the counter and the man ex
amined them, passing them to the
woman. Tbe man kept up an animated
conversation with the salesman, pointing
occasionally to different articles in the
store so as to distract his attention.
Finally tbe man said that they, would pos
sibly call again and make a purchase, but
none of the articles was exactly what they
wanted. :'.-.i.yX.\. :y*..;.-
Shortly after they had left the store the

Judge Coffey Says the Inventory Fee
"y - *;'. ) Is Legally i Collected.
Judge Coffey. handed down a decision
on Friday that will .'; prove interesting
throughout the State. .;.,, < ;.
Some time ago Attorney' C. M. Jennings
offered to Deputy County Clerk Northrop
the appraisement in the estate of Francis
Eisen, deceased, saying that be was will
ing to pay the fees for filing the same pro
vided ,he was permitted to deduct the
amount of the debts. ;
The matter Â» was referred to County
Clerk! Charles F. Curry, who found that
the appraised value of the estate was $248,
--864 39, and be .said that the $50 offered by
Mr. Jennings as a fee for filing was not
enough. He 'demanded that the law be
compiled with, which required the Clerk
to collect for the benefit of the county
treasury $1 per thousand on each addi
tional $1000 of the appraised valuation in
excess of $3000 of any estate, He declared
that he deemed it his duty to collect the
full fee as called for by the face of the in
man of the committee on laws, and he asks
all the whist-players. on' the coast that read
this letter to express their opinion on the
subject: ; â  y i "-X.hiiX '-.;:-â¢' .*.-â¢â¢â 
To the Elective Committee of the. American Whist
Leagueâ a enil* hen : . I beg leave to , suggest ;to
the executive committee that li would, in my
opinion, be for the advantage and interest of the
duplicate match 'games ln tournaments and con
tests for ' trophies,' and Indeed for -all duplicate
whist games, that a rule be established forbidding
tbe turning of , a trump In the | pack in \ play, and
requiring .the : . umpire .or parties to cut a trump
suit for the session in ; another pack. :'. y XX'j " ;' 'X
The object of having a trump turned In a game
of : short \ whist ila reasonably clear.", to wit It in
creases the chances and variety of , the game, but
I believe it would be hard Ito assign any good rea
son for It ln a gam* of duplicate. If It j gives any
advantage to one side or the other It Is contrary to
the theory of the duplicate game,' which la of per
fect equality of conditions; if It does not give any
such advantage, )is there any reason for retaining
it? 'i he true theory of duplicate whist la that each
side at beginning has no knowledge of the re
sources or strength of the other aide.
XI he turning of a trump j cant I* ln .violation of
this ' principle: ] and although the same conditions
are In turn Imposed on the other side, two wrongs
do not make a right. The recording of the tramp
turned adds greatly to the labor, trouble and diffi
culty of Keeping the score. : if the tmrao turned
Is so small as to affect the play in no degree, It jis
only so much more trouble to record and keep tbe
run of It: If sufficiently high to affect the play, It
Is contrary to the true principles of the game.
y I : therefore i respectfully : ask the committee to
consider the expediency of my suggestion. Very
truly yours, .â Fisheb ami**. ;

to confusion and might entail endless

Judge Coffey complimented Mr. Curry
on his stand in this matter and decided
that the position assumed by Mr. Jennings
is entirely untenable. v. The opinion says:
The act of March 28, 1895, provides a fee foÂ»
an official act in office and is uniform as to
amounts. It simply requires payment for ser
vices according to. values, does not refer to
person or to subject matter of an inventory and
appraisement and applies to all Couuty Clerks

MBS. COOPER'S MANY WILLS
Three More Have Been Filed in the
Probate Court.
The will of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, which
was filed some time ago, has been
denied probate by Judge Coffey because it'
did not com pi v with the law in regard to
wills olographic in form. "" "
The date was not entirely in Mrs. i
Cooper's handwriting, the printed figures '
"189".. being allowed to stand with the
addition of the written figure "6." This
defect, though apparently of minor im
portance, proved fatal, and the will was
thrown out of court. , \
Immediately after this decision three
other olographic wills written by Mrs.
Cooper and ip legal form were filed. In all
of them the entire property is bequeathed
to her daughter, Harriet. .The latest will
is dated September 20, 1894. In that Miss
Cooper was named as sole legatee. It is;
provided that if Harriet did not survive
her mother, then $2500 should be given to
the' Golden Gate Kindergarten Associa
tion and the residue should be divided be
tween the two sisters of the decedent,
share and share alike: ; â  â¢'â  â¢_>

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
t J
SUNDAY .MARCH 21, 1897
We are all for free Cuba.
It was a glorious mass-meeting.
The voice of San Francisco is eloquent.
Take a drive to-day and see the new
boulevard.
Democrats in Congress have begun bark
ing at the new tariff, but perhaps they
won't bite.
We are now about ready to give atten
tion to carnivals and festivals and bs joy
ous all round. ''*Â§:"
Jeter's vote on the coyote bill, is a very
good thing on which to give the Supreme
Court a chance to render a decision.
There is a good prospect of getting a
higher duty on Z:\nte currants and one
more California industry brightens up.
The trouble with the European concert
is that the diplomatists made the mistake
of organizing it exclusively of prima don
nas.
The odor of a coyote scalp comes very
near being a perfume in comparison with
that of the scandal that has been raised in
connection with it.
By giving a right of way for the new
boulevard ex-Mayor Sutro has conferred
another benefit upon San Francisco and
made the people proud to claim him as a
fellow-citizen.
When the farmers have succeeded in
getting the insect pests out of their fields
and orchards they wiU have to whirl in
and run the adulterated food pests out of
their home markets.
San Francisco stands with her sister
cities of the Union and shares with them
a desire for Cuban independence and a
resolve that American citizens shall be
protected both at home and abroad.
A correspondent says "McKinley has
been in office only two weeks and yet we
are shipping Hay to England and Porter
to France. , Now what can the free-traders
and Democrats say against our export
business?"
The members of the bÂ»st clubs in the
East have begun to exclude decadent
journals from their club reading-rooms as
well as from their homes and the crusade
for decency and legitimate journalism
goes bravely on.
, Tho experience of New York with a non
partisan police board is a convincing proof
that such a board is liable to have so
many cross-grained splinters in it that no
one can sit on it with any comfort and
hardly with any dignity.
The selection of good after-dinner
speakers for Embassadors to France and
to England is fairly satisfactory, out
when it comes to selecting a Minister to
Spain we must have a man who can talk
well before dinner.
It looks now as if there would evolve
out of the Greek crisis an alliance of Eng
land, France and Italy against Germany,
Russia and Austria. That would make a
good fight, with the odds in favor of
Greece and freedom.
'.According, to Congressman Loud there
is a good prospect of getting the new Fed
eral building started early in the summer
if we work together in this City. It is to
that end, therefore, we must direct our
efforts. To have prosperity we must have
harmony.
All Americans agree with the Republi
can National platform: "We watch with
deep and abiding interest the hero c bat
lie of the" Cuban patriots against cruelty
and oppression, and our best hopes go out
for the full success of their* determined
contest for liberty."
Asa New York.. woman has, obtained
judgment for $50,000 damages against
another woman for stealing her husband's
affections it is -'violent the courts of that
State know about what the average man
is worth to his wife and do not intend to
underrate the article.
It is an era of peace. Ii is true there are
wars in Cuba, Crete, Armenia, the Philip
pine and the Caroline islands, while the
British Â»re slaughtering negroes in South
Afr.ca and the Russians are slaying the
â¢wild tribes cf Central Asia; but still it is
an era of peace. The diplomatists say so.
Although a majority of the Texans
voted against the party of protection and
prosperity they are laying plans to enjoy
the benefits' of the new era, and as a
means to that end it is proposed to submit
to the people; a constitutional amend
ment exempting many kinds "\ of manu
factories from taxation for ten years.
It is reported that since the beginning of
the present year the orders sent to the
mills for steel rails exceed by over 400,000
tons the total output of rails during the
whole twelve months of .year. /.T his
evidence of returning prosperity should
convince even the most persistent doubt-
ers that belter times are coming.
Some recent tests made with com
pressed-air csrs on one of the: street rail
way lines in New.York showed that when
runnine ;at - the rate of " twenty miles an
hour the car could be stopped without a
jar within little more than its own length.
It was also shown the cars could run ten
miles with but one charge of air. It is
possible, therefore, that ' the , age \ of ; elec
tricity may some day give way to the age
of compressed air.
THE CUBAN MASS-MEETING.
* â  '43*""as*"3 s Â»s""Â»ts*'S"i^ "Wr*^^
The Cuban mass-meeting at Metropolitan Temple last evening was thoroughly
representative of the people of San Francisco. '.: It bore unmistakable testimony to
the fact that in this City, as in all other Cities '"'of the Union where similar mass
meetings have been held, the sentiments of the people are strongly in favor of the
Cuban patriots and are resolved upon protection to American ct'izens wherever
in foreign lands they may' be exposed to the wrongs of despotic Governments or
military tyranny. â¢
If anything had. been; needed to awaken the interest of the people in the cause of
Cuba, or to arouse that interest to a true enthusiasm, it would have been furnished
by the eloquent words of the orators of . the evening. The speakers were in full
accord with the audience and the occasion, and most clearly and forcibly. did
they set forth the earnestness of the people of San Francisco in the great issue
which now confronts us in dealing with the Cuban problem.
On this issue there are no party lines among the people of the United States. As
in Congress Senator Lodge, who represents the Republicans of Massachusetts, acts in
accord . with Senator Morgan, who represents the Democrats of < Alabama, so is it
among the people at large. Democrats and Republicans, men of the North and South
and West are in harmony as one united nation, resolved to uphold the cause of an
American island struggling for freedom from the domination of a European power
and for the establishment of those rights of self-government inherent in human ty for
which our ancestors under Washington fought that glorious war which revolution
ized the world. *â¢ *
The platform adopted by the Republican National Convention at St. Louis declared
what is unquestionably the prevailing sentiment of the American people in these
words:" .-..-..:,. ... , ,\, ;* .
â -â -.- ' â  '.. â  . â  . .
From the hour of achieving their own independence the people of the United States have
regarded with sympathy the struggles of other American peoples to free themselves from
European domination. We watch with deep and abiding interest the heroic buttle of the
Cuban patriots against Cruelty and oppression, and our best hopes go out for the full success
of their determined contest for liberty. : 'xX.'
The sympathies and the hopes thus expressed are those of the great mass of the
American people without respect to party. It is a source of general gratification,
therefore, that we have at the head of our Government men who were elected
on that platform and who can be relied upon to enforce it. That much was made
evident by the mass-meeting last evening, and none can doubt the strength of those
sympathies and the fervor of those hopes who listened to the ringing words of the
orators and heard the responsive cheers which applauded them. 'â '.- -XX' X. , .
San Francisco has now taken her place alongside her sister cities of the Union.
She has spoken as they have done for the Cuban patriots and for the American citi
zens who have suffered like the Cubans from Spanish despotism and military
domination. it now remains for her people to cordially co-operate with the
committee which has been appointed here to act in combination with similar com
mittees in other cities.'" This co-operation can surely be counted on. The cause of
Cuba is the cause of America. It is the cause of humanity. The people of the
United States by every instinct of patriotism and by every tradition of their history
are bound to give to that cause an unflinching, unwavering and unhesitating support.
THE FEDERAL BUILDING.
The letter from Congressman Loud to
the committee appointed to request him
to urge upon the officials at Washington
an immediate beginning of tbe work of
constructing the new Federal building is
in every respect encouraging. It holds
out to the people fair assurance* that the
work will speedily begin if only harmony
and co-operation prevail here.
Mr. Loud points out that the delay in
the construction of the work in the past
has been largely due to antagonisms in
this City. He says: "Clippings of the San
Francisco papers are kept on file here, and
almost every effort that has been made by
the delegation has been counteracted by
our own people." That these statements
are accurate is well known, and It remains
with the people of ; San Francisco to de
cide whether they will give any encour
agement to those who antagonize the new
building or will go forward, cordially co
operating with The Call in its efforts to
bring about the construction of the work
without further delay.
The outlook for the enterprise is thus
stated by Mr. Loud: "Sufficient money
has been appropriated by Congress to in
augurate the work. Two years ago the
building was placed under what we call
the continuous contract system that is,
authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury
to enter into a contract for.the completion
of the building. Now, if we can amicably
settle with some of our people the matter
of plans for the building I think we shall
have no difficulty in fretting it started
during fe early summer."
It will be seen irom this that the work
is largely in our own hands. To accom
plish that which we desire it is only neces
sary that we should act together in that
harmony with, which the new agitation
has thus far been conducted. The City
needs the building and her workingihen
require the employment its construction
will give. These two needs emphasize the
importance of cordial co-operation at this
juncture. Let us act wisely, therefore, so
that when the summer comes we shall see
tbe building under way and our workmen
employed. ____^____^_^_
A CURRENCY PLAN.
J. Brisben Walker in the March number
of the Cosmopolitan proposes a plan of
currency reform which he thinks would
ompass the much-desired- features of
automatically expanding and contract
ing the currency in accord with
commercial and industrial needs. He
claims to have given twenty - five
years' study to the subject of the
safest and best way of supplying a me
dium of exchange, and that plans similar
to his hav-* been indorsed by sucb noted
financiers as John Sherman and ex-Secre
tary Wir.dom.
His idea is to replace the National bonds
with new issue, which would be made
eagerly sought after by the enactment of
a law that they could be held by the
banks in lieu of their required: rsserve
fund. â¢ These bonds he would make inter
convertible wi' United States legal
tender notes at the will of the bolder, and
he thinks the bonds could now be sold
with an interest as low as 2 per cent. The
results he counts upon are that disastrous
panics from ; scarcity of \ cash would , be
avoided, and the remote sections of the
South and West wherever they had good
security would have equal 1 financial facili
ties with "the East.
By. his system the author says whenever
an unusual amount of money was needed
to move a crop, or whenever a scarcity of
currency threatened a disastrous. financial
crash, the 2 cent bonds could readily
1 be obtained by merchants offering their
6or 8 per cent notes. These bonds they
could take to any large postoffice and con
vert them into currency notes. Ju'^t as
soon as; the pressing urgency for money
was over these notes could be reconverted
into bonds, which would ba always avail
able at a fixed price, in order to save the 2
per cent rather, than : let the currency lie
idle. Thus automatically the volume of
money would expand in exact proportion
to the : niseds of trade, and quickly con
tract again to the \ normal amount when
the necessity of the extra issue passed
away. . '^ ' \.y'.
'X Since President McKinley has recom
mended the appointment of acoramis-ion

to Congress, it is probable we shall have
many theories on the subject to consider be
fore the problem is solved. That of Mr.
Walker offers many advantages, and some
of its features might well be adopted
when rearranging our monetary system

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 21, 1897.
THE NEW BOULEVARD.
The work which is now under full head
way on the new boulevard is one of the
things most deserving of public attention
at the present time in the City. . It is not
only a great benevolence is a great
bargain. To furnish employment to men
who are in want though willing, to work
is a praiseworthy deed. It takes away a
reproach that would lie against any so
ciety that leaves labor unemployed
where there were surplus dollars and
presumably brains enough to devise ways
and means of preventing human energy
from going to waste.
San Francisco has made a great record
in the ; past in this way by expending
$93,000 to banish want among the un
employed while creating at the Â»ame time
the beauties of the Golden Gate Park, and
in the work on the boulevard; just started
she is preparing to sustain her reputation.
No one who has studied the reports about
the unemployed can doubt that this is a
gr at benevolence, and no one who will
drive out and look at what the men are
doing can doubt that it is a great bargain.
The economy with which this new addi
tion to San Francisco's attractions will be
acquired if the enterprise so auspiciously
begun is cordially sustained by the public
is consideration enough to bring forth the
neÂ»dlul funds even if there were no force
in the argument that the method pursued
was the wisest form of charity. Not only
are the men doing a hard day's work for a
small wage, but the City gets the benefit
of skilled supervision absolutely without
cost. he plan pursued is for every dollar
of the fund to go into the pockets of the
deserving men who have failed to find em
ployment elsewhere.
Both the chairman of the general com
mittee and the chairman of the construc
tion committee are giving their personal
attention to the work, and they are men
of wide experience and special fitness for
the task. Their supervision is a guaran
tee that not only will every dollar go to
the right place in a charitable sense, but
that every dollar will be made to accom
plish in a strictly business sense jo much
work that it will ba like placing it in some
permanent and safe investment. vy;';
The boulevard is to-be a hundred feet
inwdth; it will start from the Golden
Gate Park at Seventh avenue; it will curve
around among picturesque hills and val
leys and ravines; it will take the pleasure
seeker by the beautiful Trocadero and the
racetrack at In leside; it will lead into
the Ingleside road, which is to be widened,
smoothed and perfected, and down this
fine avenue of tall trees the people in their
happy outings cad SDin behind their
spanking teams to the broad and breezy
driveway that lies along the ocean beach.,
from there they can pass to the main
driveway of Golden Gate Pant, and
through those winding ways back to their
homes in the City, after having circled
through a combination of lovely scenery,
scarcely equaled on any other driveway
of the world, y
: While we rejoice in the undertaking of
this new enterprise and felicitate ourselves
on the addition it will make to the attrac
tions of the City, let us not forget those to
whom the credit is due. To ex-Mayor
Sutro, who gave the right of way, to the
promoters of the plan, to those who are
directing the ? construction * and to those
who are assisting to pay for it all honor
should be given. X The { public spirit dis
played by these men is as creditable to
San Franciaco as the boulevard itself. X-
CASTING THEM OUT.
The people of the East have begun reso
lutely a crusade against decadent journal
ism and are taking active steps to cast
those ; journals out .of their homes, their
cubs and their libraries. 1 Aimost every
day reports come of seme new nets of ex
clusion of ; the kind and the time cannot
be far distant when the slum journals will
be compelled to find support in tbe slums
or perish there for lack of it. y '"â  r
A partial list of ; the institutions which
have excluded the decadent 'â  journals will
show the extent to which the new move*
ment has progressed. The New ,3 York
World and , Mr. : Hearst's Journal, ; which Is
made of the same pattern as his Examiner
in this City, have now been shut out from
the 'Newark : Public Library, Princeton
Theological Library, the New York^Yacht's
Club, Harvard Club of 'New York, the
Harlem V bung Men's Christian Associa
tion, the Muntauk Club of ; Brooklyn", 1 the
Dwii*ht Hall Library and Young Men's
Christian Association of \ Yale,' the -Young
Men's Christian Association -of ? Water
town, N. V., the Century Club, the Public-
Library ', of ;. Hartford. : ; Conn., j the * Public
Library of : South y Norwalk, Conn., the
Public Library yofi Ãridgeport; Conn., the
library of the New York City Mission and
Tract Society,' the Ansonia Public Library
and the New York Club. ;. . XX i.
: Following the exclusion of the decadent
journal-* ; from clubs and libraries }is f the
loss of their advertising patronage. Deal
ers see that as these journals are not read
In the homes *of intelligent people they
are not good mediums for advertising ar
ticles which are used ; ; in American (home's'
arid, consequently, withdraw, heir patron
age. As the New York Times says: "T ey
begin to see clearly that the ; newspapers
that have and hold the attention of : intel
ligent arid respectable men anil women
possess the highest value for the adver
tiser.'V':',"':y:.':V Â.V''\f y, ;â â  â¢ ..
y'ln this way the crusade in the East goes
on and society protects itself from the
evils': of gutter journalism. The move
ment has now so far ; progressed in New
York that the result can be easily fore
seen. â  There : has been, first, the moral
revolt in the home against unclean sensa
tional newspapers.:- This revolt extended
to the libraries and the clubs and has now
affected the advertisers. The decadent
journals have lost the patronage . which
pays and will soon die for lack of support.
The "slums: to -which* they pander cannot
sustain them,;! and when \ they have per
ished in New York it cannot oe long be
fore they will die out in all other parts of
the country. _ -, \-> . v )â - 'â 'â '- â '
> As the New York Sun says:
The American people, as these "new jour
nals" know, are a long-suffering people. They
will stand abuse and vulgarity almost to the
breaking point, but once their antipathy and
their detestation are aroused their sense of
antagonism and disgust is as "acute as their
sense of patience. It. is this relentless antag
onism which the hew journalism must lace,
and the result can' ns readily be foreseen as
was the handwriting on the wall, in other
days. : '":'' ' ' . â¢".'â " ' '- â¢'.:..-. â  Â-'..: .â ,'â â¢
SPAIN'S A-.L Ar.Y rOWER.
The prodigious efforts "which Spain is put
ting forth in Cuba and the Philippines have
astonished those who have been led to believe
that the nation was on the verge of bank
ruptcy. What with serious ; disaffection at
home and open rebellion in her colonies, it i 3
a question how long Spain can keep up a drain
which many nations usually accounted more
powerful would find a most serious burden.
The figures tell their own story.; In Cuba,
including the re-enforcements ol the Eleventh
Expeditionary Corps, but not counting volun
teers, there are 107, battalions of infantry, 6
guerrilla companies, 3 of the guardia civil, 1
disciplinary brigade, 4 squadrons of cavalry,
2 regiments of mountain and 2 battalions of
field artillery, also 2 battalions of sappers, be
sides battalions of telegraphers, railroad
troops, etc., numbering in all some 200,000
officers and men. The force In Porto Rico is
about 6000, and in the Philippines, according
to the Re vista Teenies, is about â â  30,760, of
whom 14,000 are national infantry.
At home there are with the colors 64.190
infantry, .14,346 . cavalry, 11,774 artillery,
5294 engineers. 2400 army service establish
ment, 14,079 guardia civil and 14,186 gendar
merie, making a total of nearly 129,000 offi
cers and men. Thus Spain Is now keeping on
a war footing at home and abroad an army of
more than 371,000 men. Th 9 significance of
these figures. ls apparent when we compare
them with the strength of the German army,
which is 557,000 men. Considering the popu
lation* and resources of the two countries
gives a clearer idea of the : enormous efforts
which Spain is now putting forth.
By a law of the last Congress the National
Guard will soon be uniformly armed with the
Springfield rifle, cal. 45. These arms will be Is
sued by the Secretary of War in return for those
now held by the guard. This very important
step will result in giving the forces of the dif
ferent States a most excellent weapon, and,
besides, will give uniformity ln ammunition,
a point of great importance whenever .troops
of different States are brought together for a
common purpose. The Springfield has stood
the test of time and use, and the absence of
the magazine principle is not such a draw
back as at first sight would; appear. Even
with magazine arms the magazine will not be
used except in times of great extremity, and
then only for a very ; limited period of time.
For every other purpose the Springfield gives
a fire which is quite rapid enough for accurate
work.. Being a single-loader there will be less
excuse for wasting ammunition an<l a conse
quent simplification of its supply service.
Up to ; the present,/ time - the French army
cyclists have been employed to transmit
orders and carry messages, but it is now pro
posed to form a corp*-of true bicyclist com
batants sort of mounted infantry. An ex
perimental company uses a folding wheel
which will enable its rider to transport It
easily on bis shoulders whenever any great
obstacle is encountered. Each man is armed
with the Lebel rifle and carries 120 rounds.
Two cycle smiths are attached to the company
to make the ordinary repairs.' The company
was tested at the last autumn maneuvers, near
Laon, where It was utilized for reconnoitering,
scouting and outposÂ»t duties/ For occupying
advanced positions, If such as r ; bridges and
heights, such a company will prove ; most use
ful, owing to Its rapidity of movement. Ger
many is also training a corps of cyclists for
similar purposes. * " y", r ;y

Apropos of the arrest of a young woman In

recalls his experience in the same city and on
the -ame avenue some time ago.
fit was on a wlfi try day in February, and the
sleighing was good.' A f barga drawn by four
spirited horses and filled witn a merry sleigh
lug party came gliding down the avenue, the
horses In full gallop. At one of the crossings
the leaders struck the young man from Boston,
who was thrown flat on his back, tie four
horses passing over htm on the run. B^iore
the horses â  could rbe stopped ; the barge had
partly passed over, the prostrate body of the
young man, and he was pulled out irom be
tween the 'fore and aft runners. There were
screaming and f Hinting among the crowd wno
witnessed tbe spectacle, but luckily the youug
man h .d no cause to join m the shrieking or
swooning. He had gone through his frightful
experience without - incurring a scratch or a
bruise. On regaining nls leet a policeman
rushed up and shouted: v. â¢-.

Some of Oor Socialistic Ways.
- Editor San Francisco Call-But: In thinking over the public attitude toward the urtem
ployed and the struggle made to raise money to set them at work on the new boulevard, I have
been led to wonder why we are so reluotant to make emergency, work of this kind a part of our
municipal providence, and this has brought into review the somewhat astonishing extent : to â 
which our ways are and always have been purely socialistic. y. : y.' ;;"â  :'â¢...â 
We now employ a large number of men to grade and pave our streets, and then to repair
them and keep them imperfectly clean. S These men are employed and paid by the City with
money raised by regular or special taxation. But the levying and collecting of the tax, the
employment of the men and the payment of their wa^es are acts of pure socialism; thÂ«t is,
the people as a whole do for themselves as a whole the street work v of. the City as a common
need of tnÂ« public for the people as a whole. v,y ' . 1. ; , , Â""" .Â«.Â«,,.-_ ' mM ,.
We have almshouses and hospitals, asylums and schools for feeble-minded children, public
homes for the more unfortunate of our people, and every man above the grade of a miser feels
proud of these humane institutions and counts them a credit to our civilization. : But is not
the man in enforced idleness through no fault of his own. but through tile operation of social
laws over which he has no power of control and is utterly unable to change, as much an object
worthy of public solicitude and humane consideration as our hopelessly dependent clnsse*.?.
A city without a public park would be a public disgrace," bin no city ever set apart land for
a park, laid it out and made it Â« thing of beauty and public joy forever, that did not commit
itself to that extent to tbe establishment of soria ism pure and simile.'; A city without a public
library is not to be classed as civilized, and; yet every public library Ins the world is a monu
ment of honor to socialism and a public demonstra lon of its wisdom and beneficence. A city
or communi y without a public school would be a lin*rerlng example of the dark ages; and it
we should a tempt to perpetuate .our' f -rta of government by abolishing the public schools, it
would go down in despair and give place to despotism, and yet the public school is one of the
best examples of pure socialism, v 'â¢â ' '"~- : XX' : XX' '""'. '"'_ Jl. " .!,_
But time would fail me were I to attempt to enumerate and discuss even the more notable ;
examples ol socialism, and I must depend upon the Intelligence of the reader to see. as soon as
he begins to reflect, thai even our form of governmentâ municipal.county, State and National
is based absolutely on socialism. /. -i 'â¢""".: XI "'""â¢'' -li-'-" â '-'" '". â """-'-â¢ X^X
In regard to salaries, as a matter of course the same law obtains. From the country school
teacher to the president of the State University, from the country Justice of the Peace to the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of tne Nation, from they Mayor of , the smallest city to the
President of the United States, every salary paid a public official is a social tic salary beyond
the possibility of a quibble. Boards oi Health, milk and food, inspectors and all such . public
functionaries are examples of the socialistic system applied to the several services designated.
In fact the more we look Into the matter the more absurd it seems that we have been so slow to
recognize the justice and common sense of providing public employment for the unemployed.

RICHMOND SCHOOL NEEDS.
The Present Crowded Condition; of
Grammar Classes Makes New Ac
commodations Necessary.
The matter of a new schoolhouse for the
Richmond District was discussed before
the Buildings and Grounds Committee of
the Board of Education yesterday.
"Richmond; has grown so fast of late tbatk
the school .fa cilities are not sufficient; to A
accommodate the pupils and a deputation Â«
of residents of the section was invited to/
explain to the committee their needs in
the matter. . â¢
- Superintendent Fletcher of Odd Fellows'
Cemetery addressed the committee, stat
ing that many pupils had to attend down
town grammar schools because there were
no classes to accommodate them near
their homes. He said that if the board
would s-tatui by the Richmond people and
make provision for a school the citizens
there would doall in their power to per
suade the Board of Supervisors to grant an
appropriation for tbe purpose.
He stated the cit zens would content
themselves with additional classrooms to
the present schools in the locality it a
new building could not be obtained and
provided the extra rooms would care for
the pupils. â¢ ;
The Buildings and Grounds Committee
will discuss the matter and report to the
board at an early date.

HENRIK IBSEN'S NEW DRAMA.
artOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN" will proba- |
% bly be a disappointment to many read
__\ ers of Ibsen. The last high wave of
realism seems to have carried him far
ashore and left him on a desolate and verdure
less land, almost out of sound of the great sea
music which thrilled us in "Brand" and "Peer
Gynt."
Ibsen is a terrible pessimist His is not the
fierce melancholy of youth, born often of a
noble discontent and begetting the flue wish
to shatter this worid to bits "and then remold
it nearer to the heart's desire." ,
On the contrary, his is the hopeless pessi
mism of age, an age whose increasing years
have brought no solution of the awful prob
lems of life, and no belief that somehow good
.will be the final work of ill. He sees with a
â  clear-eyed and pitiless vision those moral
maladies which eat into our civilization to
day. He exposes not so much crime and the
great obvious errors of mankind as the subtle
sins of the heartâ selfishness, hypocrisy, cant.
There was enough in Ibsen's early life to ac
count for his temper of mind. While he was
still a lad his father, who had been the most
wealthy and. influential citizen of Skien,
abruptly lost his fortune and with it his social
position. The family was compelled to move
* to a desolate farm, and the boy, Henrik, had
an object lesson in the insincerity of lair
weather friendships, which be never forgot.
The old, gay, hospitable life was a thing of
the past, and with it had gone the friends of
that Mme. This change deepened the gloom
of the boy's temperament, and began that em
bittering process which. later years were to
intensify. X ,-X \
The family poverty prevented him from
studying painting, as he wished, and a few
years later he was apprenticed to a chemist in
Grimstad. This little seaport town wav a very
hotbed of cant. Perhaps it was here that be
grew to loathe chat particular vice, and per
haps even then he resolved to strip off some
time layer after layer of hypocrisy and sham
from the social conventions of his time. . The
intellectual life of Grimstad was as restricted
and the moral horizon as narrow as that of
any remote Puritan village fifty years ago.
Here the young poet soul, already tremulous
with creative power, felt itself - fettered,
repressed, misunderstood on every side.
It is small wonder that,' chafing
under a constant repression, Ibsen be
came an almost frantic apostle of individu
alism. Years afterward in a speech to the
students of Christiania be said: ''All social
. and domestic institutions which hamper the
free growth ot the individual are evil."
His first drama, "Catalina," published at the
expense of an optimistic friena, was a com
plete failure. After he had gone tb Christiania
to study medicine the whole edition was sold
for waste paper to buy food for un empty
stomach. His second word, "The Heroic
Mound," fared a little tetter and made him
resolve to forsake medicine and live by his
pen. It is bard to say how he might have
fared during the last few years had it not been
for. Ole Bull, who procured him the posi
tion of director to the theater in Bergen. This
was a Government appointment, which gave j
him a small salary. .He retained this position j
for several years, though it 'must have been j
intolerably irksome to him. He was more
than ever fettered. He was a servant of the
public and their tss:e had to be his choice. |
He was 30 years old before he really began his j
career as a dramatic satirist with "Love's
Comedy." Â§PfTÃi tXy
This drama, which discusses the question as
to whether "marriage is incompatible with
I love," horrified the good people of Cnristiania.
The poet found himself an object of aversion
and distrust. Worst oi all he was lashed by the
critics, who failed to see any genius or even
promise of genius in his work. He felt him
â¢ self mentally suffocated in that air of censure,
and it is not surprising that as soon as it be
came possiile he shook, as he said, the dust of
that country forever from his feet. Ever
since that time he has lived a voluntary exile,
first in Italy and later in various German
cities.
t After the writing of "Brand," "Peer Gynt"
and "Emperor And Galilean" had made him
famous, the Norwegians were proud to cele
brate Ibsen's greatness and to remember him
as their countryman. But tnat triumph was
of small value to the man who had come to
regard motive as the supreme test of human j
conduct. A great ovation was given him j
when he revisited his country for a short j
time, ten years after leaving it. In a speech !
which ne made on that occasion he said:
"What is needed is a* revolution of the spirit
of man." '
The prose dramas which followed the three
poetical dramas showed a marked change in !
Ibsen's method. The themes were not unlike. I
He still satirized convention and made his j
strong plea for the "divine right of individu- j
ality," but his manner was strikingly differ
ent. Instead of treating bis subject symboli
cally, as in "Brand" and "Peer Gynt," he
' treated it with great literalness, as in "The
Soil's House," and became a realist. But still
individualism is the keynote of all.
In "Brand" we have the idealist and dream
er who tries to live a literal Christian life and ]
whose creed is "all or nothing." He fails of
his ideals and of his divine individuality, be
cause, though be sacrifices, himself to the ut
termost, be has never realized that God is "a
God of love." .
In "Peer Gynt" we have the antithesis of
Brand. The hero symbolizes the spirit of comp
romise. He hedges even in his ethics. He
makes a fortune in the slave trade, and to ease
bis conscience exports Bibles and mission
aries. When he bears a lion roaring ln the
wilderness he "trusts in the Lord," hut, "all
I the same," he would like to get up a tree.
His soliloquy when be sees his yacht with his
treasure and faithless friends aboard standing
out to sea is one of the bitterest satires on in
sincere religion ever penned. Peer Gynt,
though thinking constantly ol self, has never
found his true self at all. "* ?; : _
If Brand through his blindness and Peer
Gynt through his selfishness have failed of
their true individuality", Nora in- "The Doll's
House" has been cheated of hers, because by
reason of her artificial lite she bas never been
allowed to have any. She is first' her father*
pet and then her husband's. Only when she,
quite unwittingly, commits a legal crime that
involves her husband in disgrace is she . held
to account as. a responsible human being.
After this crisis in her life ' she resolves to
leave her husband's home and find herself I
When be reminds her of her duties to her hus
band and children she answers, "I have other
duties equally sacred." He retorts, â¢â¢No, you
have not. What do you mean?" and she says,
"Duties toward myself." X
When be reminds her that before all else she
is a wife and a mother she answers:
"1 ho longer think so. I think that before
all else I am a human being."
In the succeeding dramas, no matter what
the subject, .we find variations of the same
theme. In "Ghosts" the obvious motif is the
curse of .heredity,' but the keystone of the
whole ethical structure is the sin of yielding,
as Mrs. Aiving did, the individual sense ;of
right to the social or conventional. ; y '
I Those wbo have watched Ibsenlc develop
ment as, the prophet" of individualism have
great interest in j finding whs i; phase of the
question is presented in the new drama, "John
Gabriel Borkman."/ At first glance the old fire j
and power seem lacking. I The atmosphere is
a leaden gray. There ;is a deadly common- j
place about ; the whole. r The unlovely 'char- ,
racters i are almost brutally drawn. , The
total effect seems negative. A sort of wan
despair pervades the whole. There is no" high
j tragic note "to purge the mind by pity and by
fear," as the ancient poet hath it.
On the contrary, we seem to see a dreary
i morass, stretching out endlessly under a bleak
sky. But alter reflection we come to the con
clusion that this effect is the result of consum
mate art, because it more perfectly than any
other illustrates that phase of bis subject
which Ibsen dwells upon here. In this drama
he considers the most subtle feature of the
whole question, namely, the voluntary de
struction of one human creature, of another s
possible soul development, joy, and fullness of
individuality. John' Gabriel Borkman is a
man who has sacrificed everything to money
getting, not to.mere vulgar acquisition but in
desiie of the power and splendor of money
which fire his imagination. ; '
To, advance his purpose he gives up the
woman he loves and who loves him. Years
alter, when he, having staked all and foiled,
has become a broken and dishonored man,
and she an unhappy and loveless woman, she
tells him that he has committed the one mor
tal sin, the crime for which there is no for
giveness. And when he, self-centered as of
old, and still nursing his dream of power,
wonders what she means, she tells him:
"You are a murderer. You have killed the
love-life ln me. Do you understand what
that means? The Bible speaks of a mysteri
ous sin for which there is no forgiveness. I
bave never understood what it could be;, but
now I understand. The great, unpardonable
sin is to murder the love-Hie in a human
soul."
And again she 6ays to him: 'You have done
to death all the gladness of life in me. From
the day when your image began to dwindle In
my mind I have lived my life as though under
an eclipse. During all these years it has grown
harder and harder for me, and at last utterly
impossible to love any human creature. Hu
man beings, animals, plantsâ l shrank Irom
from an but oneâ " :.
That one is his son and her nephew. For
Borkman, after giving up Ella Rentheim for
the sake of gaining tbe support of the man
necessary to his success, bad married her
sister.
His wife is a hard woman who cannot for
give him for her humiliation, and for eight
years alter his return from prison he lives in
the upper part ot the house and she below.
He spends bis time pacing up and down the
long gallery "like a hungry wolf," and the
two never meet. To have Erhart, her nephew,
with ber is the one desire of Ella Rentheim's
life. His mother, on her part, has dedicated
his life to the building up of the family
honor. The aunt longs to make his life happy,
but It must be as an adjunct of her own. Both
of these women wish to dominate the life of
the young man with small regard of his own
right of self-freedom.
Meanwhile Master Erhart has formed quite
other plana for himself, and, gayly shaking all
obligations and responsibilities from bis
shoulders, departs with a lady of uncertain
character "to live bis own life," Erhart's
character is relentlessly selfish â a sort of
! dead. satire on that "individualism", which
! Ibstn no doubt' sees quite often . in the world
| about him. . It is as ii he said to his readers:
i '.'Don't flatter yourselves, O pleasure-loving
j generation, that by individualism I mean a
I selfish following of desire regardless of all
i other claims. You see what that comes to iv
this instance and how hideous it is."
I At the same time he makes us feel that those
] others had 110 right to make such claims upon
I Erhart's life. There Is nothing wholly ad-
I mirable and no character wholly unselfish in
j the drama.- We look for something fine in the
I loyalty of the one ola frleud who Is still
i faithful to Borkman, but we aro shown that
J even that friendship rests on a basis of deceit
; and self-interest. There is a tacit under
| standing between the two that each shall pro-
I fess a belief in the other's success. The old
clerk desires to be a poet, to Borkman alone
j he confides the fact that he has written a
j tragedy. _ -X-yX--
Borkman encourages the clerk in order that
| the clerk may encourage him in his fantastic
| hopes, for the future. . And each conscious of
! his own insincerity doubts the other and yet
! clings with all the strength of vanity to the
delusion. The scene between the two is de
pres-ilngiy unlovely.
In the closing act the dialogue becomes
more impassioned and Hits some
what from the dead level of real
> ism. Borkman, strangely excited, leaves tbe
i house and wanders out into the night, saying
! he must begin to climb those heights he has
| vowed to reach. Ella goes with him. The two
: come out on a plateau overlooking the valley.
i His mind dwells upon his one â¢ dominant
thought. He speaks of his "kingdom"â the
kingdom he was on the point of conquering.
"I seem to touch them, the prisoned mii
p lions; I can see the veins of metal stretch out
| their winding, branching, luring arms to me.
i I saw them belore my eyes like living shapes
'â  that night I stood in the strong-room with the
candle in my band. * *; * I will whisper it
to you hero in the stillness of the night. I
love you as you lie there spellbound in the
deeps and the darkness 1 I love you, life
craving riches, with all your shining train of
! power and glory I .love you, love you, love
! youi" .
.When befalls, stricken to death, Ella says,
I "It was the cold that killed him," and the
| wife answers, "The cold that had â  killed him
j long ago," and Ella returns, "Yes, and
| changed us into shadowsâ dead man and
; two sb ado that is what the cold has made

Car.eton L. Bronson, instructor ln ; Greek In
Yale University, : has here revised, 'enlarged
and in part rewritten the popular work of Dr.
Smith which was published about thirty years
ago. Since that time the knowledge of Greek
tory has been much enlarged by investiga
tions, and especially by the discovery of Aris
totle's work on the constitution of the
Athenians. That part of the work which deals
with the history of, Greek literature, the con
stitutional history of Athens ;.' and the
topograpny ; and the monuments of ; the city
has been entirely rewritten. A feature of the
book is a description of the architectural and
artistic treasures of Athens. The maps plans
and illustrations have all been prepared fresh
for the revised edition. The short history is
admirable for those who havo not the time or
the patience to read the more elaborate works
about the famous country from which we have
derived so large a portion of our civilization.
The research of these -students of history has
induced them to give the verdict that Alex
ander the Great was a humane leader, a true
friend and a man of great purity and upright
ness of character.

Their wage of duty done below;
.Loose thou these memories in sleep.
Tell me what dark, eternal Ides
Across the space their shadows throw.
Clouding the happy light that rides
Unto these lands of pain and woe
Brother and sister gone, forego
Fairy hilltops and valleys deep;
Come, or if this be never so,
Loose ye these memories in sleep.
Ah, welll A splendid city hides
The little boy of long ago;
Beneath a village church wall bides
A slender mound above the snow;
And thus the fleet years come and go.
Poor bands of mine that cannot keep
Backward the waters' ebb and flow;

doctrine of evolution by Spencerâ who formu
lated the theory as a whole the year preceding
the publication of the "Origin of Species','â,
Darwin and Huxley. Reviewing the present
condition of the question as to man and mind,

Among numerous confections there has of
iate been made a lovely skirt of the palest
shade of Nile green, and with it goes a
bodice of green crepe, which has a high
corselet that decreases in width in the cen
ter of the waist in front, and is of mauve
velvet The low bodice is edged with
mauve velvet, covered with lace attached
with diamond ornaments. Fine lace is
used for epaulets.
Quite effective is a gown of. pale rose
pink brocade. The bodice is exquisitely
cut, and down one side extend undulating
revers "of the finest Alencon, and it al
most entirely composes the dainty sleeves.
Truly delightful we must all admit is an
embroidered crepe of a delicate shell pink
inserted with motifs of, lace embroidered
in silver. This silvered lace forms the en
tire bodice, attached at the back and in
front with three straps of black velvet in
the shape of a calice. The train is of
maize velvet of just the tone to blend
with the delicious pink. Black feathers
were worn in the hair.
The same pretty woman owns a black
crepe de chine of the most superior qual
ity. It is closely embroidered in jet and
is handled so as to convey a clinging
effect, and is made over a royal purple
foundation.
A white toilette I greatly admire Â» has a
bolero of real Irish point lined with pink.

'The Redingote.
In Paris much is being said about a
certain redingote seen not many moons
ago heliotrope cloth covered with a de
sign in black velvet applications, edged
with chinchilla, with a waistcoat of white
guipure and a waist ribbon of mauve satin
fastened with two large diamond buttons.
Dinner gowns are topics of unfailing in
terest, as all who are in the social world
are at times either preparing, mentally,
some charming confection or are consid
ering their dressmaker's latest sugges
tions. For the moment light and dark
contrasts in the same dress are considered
smart. One sucb is of an old-rose brocade,
the center panel of the skirt : and waist
being of striped satin in faint pink with '
suggestions of green. The stripes run
crosswise and * give the desired effect of
plumpness, wnich is increased by a jaunty
bolero jacket heavily embroidered in pink
and pearl passementerie. â _.â â ":.'â â¢<;

Jl; Kentucky: Belie.
The lovely Miss ' Alice Castleman ap
peared at the charity ball in New York in
a black creation, a little yellow about her
low-cut corsage being the only touch of
color about her, otherwise somber gown,
but the black formed an admirable set
ting for. Miss Castleman's blonde loveli
ness. On this, her r - first appearance, her
beauty created a profound- *eusation, and
one of the daily papers sent a special cor
respondent down to see her in her own
environment, and the frontispiece of the \
next Sunday's edition was adorned by, her
classic features and a page was devoted to
the interview with her. â¢-i - . ' ' *
Miss tleman's; beauty deserves i the
meed of praise it is receiving, for â " seldom
does one find more perfect face "and: more
perfect figure united in one person. 'â â-. Her
appearance might be described as fault
lessly faultless. . In ) her Kentucky shows
once a.am that her fame for fair women is
well deserved.
I do not know the age of this new belle,
but as a rule black is far toxoid : for young
debutantes. ; ; As paradoxical as it may
seem, all debutantes are not youthful;
for example, those who have made their !
social entree for three, four or even five
winters in succession may indulge in
black, but the dear, fresh, starry-eyed,
golden-haired. .fairies . should wear only
the most delicate of indeed, I con
sider them most lovely when in pure white.
. Another handsome toilet reverses the
contrast, as the principal part is of polka
dot brocaded satin, with : light pink em
broidery on the panels. A debutante's
frock at the same dinner carried out the
contrast well, as the dress, of light-bine"
China silk, was crossed by rows of dark
blue ribbon, as was also the vest, two pan
els of the skirt and the wide girdle. The
bodice was held together with dark silk
cord in the old-fashioned way, so becom
ing to slight graceful figures. Â«.
Emerald .Hues.
Green promises to continue in high
favor, and lately a leader of fashion wore
an exquisite dinner gown of two shades of
green. The front petticoat and vest of the
bodice were of seafoam green, embroid
ered with ferns of the dark natural green
tones. \ The remainder of the dress at the
back and sweeping train were of the dark
green in glistening satin. The long sleeves
and low neck were finished in artistic
bands of the seafoam green, embroidered
in the natural -ferns.
Â, The Children r
Look like little angels in the delicious
dainty frocks many a mother ' has bad
fashioned at home under her own watch

yards of narrow lace are being used, so
numerous are the frills they must edge,

ribbons the results are charming. White
is the most satisfactory always, as it
washes so well, but green and pink are
both good colors. Mothers should always
endeavor to have such dresses made in as
childish a manner as possible, for therein

When yon. have an accumulation of
remnants and do not know exactly what
to have the home dressmaker work on,
allow me to suggest that many a fascinat
ing tea jacket has been evolved under just
such circumstances. ' y y
"One of the prettiest lately, seen was a
pink brocade with a pink chiffon front,
having quite a narrow basque, all sewn at
the edge with pearls, a strip of white satin
descending from the shoulder to the bust,
on either side edged with pearls, and the
puff to the top of the sleeve having the
same strappings carried down at intervals.
Next to pink in favor comes dark green,
and for quiet tea jackets worn in London,
where the hostess receives her friends on
her return from her daily drive, . dark
green chiffon bodices with red and green
shot ruffled sleeves and a pleated bolero
are very fashionable indeed. These sleeves
are continued over the hand in points,
with a deep ruffle at the 'wrist and a roll
collar of red satin sunpleniented by lace."
No longer are dainty women content
with the regulation bed jackets of flannel
or of embroid red Japanese silk. Instead
they have chic little affairs of silk arid
mull, or silk in combination with 1 either
chiffon or mousseline de sole. These gar
ments are lined with a very lightweight
flannel or with nun's veiling. Many are
made up during this Lenten season that
would serve as models of elegance. By
these trivial things the naturally refined
woman shows her taste. Mabcella.
Mrs. Abner McKinley, : while ' visiting
New York just before the inauguration,
purchased a handsome empire cloak of a
brocaded velvet that shades from crimson

scattered over it are most gorgeous chrys

of violet velvet, and up the front is a grad

been so popular, will lose ; its prestige it

sack has usurped its place as the cut for
coats in the estimation of the man of busi

season is a ' four-button ' cutaway sack rof

These maidens are all between 15 and 17,
and they leave a lock of their natural hair
at a wigmaker's, with ' instructions ',; to
somewhat match it by shades of gray hair,
not at first too far removed from the origi
nal color. A toupee affair is purchased to
be worn ala false bangs. The gray hairs
are carefully intertwined with the dark
locks, and one is perfectly up to date.
Spring Costume.
One of the newest is composed of a dark
blue and white shepherd's plaid. The
bodice has a wide pleat, both back and
front, which narrows toward the ) belt.
; The skirt is plain, with a wide pleat in
front, which .spreads out ; wider at the
front arid is fastened down just behind
the waist line. There are' a few white
pearl buttons on the front pleat in the
bodice -about .the bust, and dark blue
surah forms the belt and collar.
Gloves.
"â¢> For wear with tailor. dresses only heavy
dogskin gloves are correct,' and for calling
all delicate shades of suede that will har
monize with the gown are worn.. For teas
and receptions in the day time some still
prefer white glace kids,; black -stitched,
with four-buttons. However, they are no
longer in demand, and for the. evening
white or light-colored suede are liked.
â  j â  T White and (Sold. </,
To have an artistic table is the aim of
every hostess, and nothing can be prettier
than a white ana gold dinner; besides,' it
is easily arranged. Golden-lined flowers
and ribbons of satin that match can read-,
ily be placed on a Handsome damask cloth
with delightful results, .cut glass and sil
ver assisting the effect. The ices, punch, '
icings of the cakes and bonbons must all
be of the same hue, as well as the shades
of the lamps. If the hostess has ' golden
hair and wears a white and yellow gown
the results can be imagined.
f Jlbout Fans.
Strange is it not that but comparatively
few women have ever devoted themselves
to fan-painting with . the smallest degree
of success? y: X..;,. :^,-.
â¢jit is so truly a feminine occupation the
painting and mountingâ one should
imagine that women would excel in it.
However, such is riot the case, and one of
the most, beautiful fans ever seen is the
work of F. Houghton, the renowned Eng
lish fan- painter. ; The center delights the
eye. by the most charming representation
of the 'minuet.* This \ gem is surrounded
by a frame of delicate Honiton lace, the
production of a clever worker and
draughtsman. In this design are com
bined tbe rose, thistle and shamrock, sur
rounded by an appropriate border.
. The mountings are of tortoise shell.
Point de gaze is the favorite lace at
present for rare fans, and this exquisite
cobweb texture Is"*, fancifully shaped to
either surround or interlace single, double
or treble medallions in kid or crepe, these
being enriched with rare paintings. . ,
Beautiful empire fans are being shown.
I the vest was brought about by wise men
who finally -? succeeded ;,'.'â  in . convincing
tailors that decollete waistcoats and flaring
shirt bosoms could scarcely be considered
the proper thing for men of business to
, wear during the hours i they were at work. ,
;; The trousers are made lof I the : same \
material as the coat and vest, and they are
cut much in i the same - fashion as those of
last season, except in the bottom of the
legs,' which are cut narrower, and in this
the only objection to this otherwise per
fect business suit is found. Straight-cut
trousers with a slight "spring" at the
bottom will always be the most popular
with business men. ,y
; -A three-button cutaway; sack, made on
the same style, with a wider flare at tbe
corners, will also be in vogue, but it does
not deserve to beâ and probably" will not
beâ as popular as the four-button sack. ': .

Fop Evening Weap.'
.:, For practical gowns the white grena
dines, . thickly -,' covered with spots the
size of a pea in silk of some bright color,
promise to be liked almost as well as those
' ! woven jto resemble lace, those - that " are
, I dotted ;on the tussore grenadines with
â¢ I bright checks thrown over them, or the
> gayly colored grounds covered ' with V a
, white net, as -if coarse â ' lace had been
- placed over them. ~X Xy' "
> Numerous are the grenadines and
s bareges , with black effects in color that
"show a tendency to chine patterns in the
grounds, and some of the patterns in the
grenadines recall quilting."
. But newer f than any of these are . the
semi-transparent materials intended for
flauncings that show an interwoven bor
der, says an authority. "A large s range of
bareges are thus v bordered, and plain col
ored voiles with silk borders, some of a
two-inch solid stripe, r I others about j four
inches deep, formed of a narrow stripe in
peach and white, cerise and white,' brown
and blue and other colorings, and occa
sionally graduated. * Some of the â¢ latest
tweeds also display such borders.
. "Printing has been applied to grena
dines, both as checked and florally, and
there are many varieties of crepe de chine,
which, to be fashionable, must be dull,
with no luster." Some of the quaintest of
the bareges of the most expensive varie
ties â¢" are covered with a twisted scroll
formed of upstanding loops like bath
toweling. Those considered stylish
twenty or thirty years ago are again en
joying a great vogue. Occasionally these
display a pattern that looks as though it
was brocaded, produced in what seems to
be a bubble of siik, and it partakes of the
nature of matelasse. The smaller pat
terns are often thrown on a check ground.
Shepherds' plaids will be : much worn,
and are seen in silk, in wool , and in mix
tures that combine the two. :
In the fancy grenadines we will shortly
observe a considerable variety of small
lined checks in reliefâ "generally blackâ
and silk on a wool foundation. The most
effective are black checks on grass-green
and blue on green. ; Ihe \ fawn-checked
grenadines of black pattern are sure to be
worn with an admixture of scarlet in the
toque or bonnet" ,--."â '. X X '-:'
You will be surprised at the great beauty
of the grass lawns and all kindred weaves;
some will have 'X horizontal y a stripes of
Valenciennes lace, interwoven on a colored
stripe, sue- as a Holland tinted ground,' a
bright green stripe, subdued with a row of
creamy lace. Blendings are to be had in
peach color, bright , pink- and pale blue.
No more delightful : stuffs < have we seen
for many, a long day, and besides their
manifest attractions they wear well and
have sufficient body not to become limp
like rags, and do riot crease readily. The
diversity of the checks on grass lawn
grounds is so great ;;, that everyone will be
fully satisfied, and the colors that are
found in combination are seldom inartis
tic. For example, in one cose, fawn, brown,
green and red figured with excellent re
sults. 1 '' Ââ',;.."_-. â¢-. '\ "
The intermixture of a tinsel thread in
woolen goods â¢ this winter ; was so much
liked that in several of the mixed woolens
just uncased, this idea is again carried out
successfully. I must not ' forget to add
a slight concession in favor of soft outing
Fedoras. i* The derbys which will be prin
cipally worn this year will have a round
crown of medium height and an almost
straight brim. -They can be of black or a
light brown to suit the taste of the wearer.

slightly turned brims will also '-. be con

But perhaps the greatest marvel the
times have perfected is the loose jacket
that in the beginning was flowing and

HE public libraries of San Fran- !
t Â»' Cisco are among the best equipped
%yjfAn the world and in the way. of in
structing, educating and amusing
the public are accomplishing a work that j
! iti all probability no other agency could.
.There are scores of small libraries in San !
Francisco that have been established in I
Connection with different organizations |
and secret societies, but they are only ac
cessible^ to the members of these associa
tions. But there are others to which any
reputable person may attain access, freely
or at a very slight cost. .
_ The San Francisco Free Publtc Library
Is probably the most popular institution of
the kind in the City. All that one re
quires to become a member of it is the in
dorsement of some citizen in good stand
ing. It is absolutely free. It has an im
mense stock of books, which is being con
stantly increased by the. purchase of new
publications. The reference-room con
nected with the library deserves special
commendation, as it is thoroughly
â  equipped and splendidly managed.. .
Then there are the library of the Me*
cbanics' Institute on Post street and the
Mercantile library in Van Ness avenue,
both of which are splendidly supplied with
good books. There are 74,000 volumes
upon the shelves of the library of the Me
chanics' Institute, and as it "is. located in
the heart of the business portion of the
City, and is easy of access.it has a very
large membership. The Mercantile Li
brary is of the same character as that of
the Mechanics' Institute.' Upon its
shelves are to be found the productions of
â Abe best authors of this and other coun
ties. The Theosophical Library and
rtbat of jhe Academy of Science are
institutions such as their names indicate,
and the works upon their shelves treat of
theology and of science.
Â» The Y.M. C. A library is a most pleas
ant place for one who loves good books to
visit. The works of all the standard au
thors are to be found mere.

block, containing several thousand vol

as the books can be catalogued.
These public libraries of the City. are
doing for those of larger growth what the
public schools are doing for the children.
Quietly and unostentatiously they are dis
tilling an influence for good whose gentle
effects are felt in many homes of the City.-

libraries of .the City have written concern

Visitors for the first time entering the
Public. Library frequently are heard to ex
, press surprise at the size ot the institn-
I tion and the extent to which it is used.
I Located as it is in the City Hall, its iden
tity Is tost in a measure, and for those not
accustomed to patronize' it there is no
conspicuous reminder or its existence, as
there would be were it boused in a build
ing of its own. It occupies the second
and third floors of tbe easterly wing; on
the McAllister-street side of the Hall and
is reached by an elevator running from
* the entrance at -the corner of the wing. y]
The. library contains 85,000 volumes in
its main collection and 7000 volumes in
the five branch libraries. Of the books in
the main library about 9000 are classified
as English prose fiction, while 4000 more
are of a character appealing. more to the
younger readers and form the children's
"library. The remainder of the collection,
or five-sixths of the whole, is made up of
representative works in all- branches of
s * literature, the arts and sciences. The col
lection is growing constantly, several
thousand* volumes' being added each year.
The library is a municipal institution sup
ported by fuhds derived from taxation,
and governed by a board of twelve trus
tees, including the .Mayor as a member
ex officio. * It is free to all residents of the
city. oyer 12 years of age who comply with
its regulations, and to non-resident tax
c payers. X-XX'x X
The only formality required in order to
become a member is the filing of an ap
plication, stating the name and address of
the applicant, and indorsed hy some re
sponsible party. There are at the present
time 19.0C0 registered borrowers enjoying
the privileges of the library. Over 30,000
volumes per month, or 1000 per day/are
issued for home use and over 20,000 vol
umes per month are issued for use in the
rooms of the library. A 12-page bul
letin je issued monthly, for free distribu
tion containing lists of the current acces
jLijns.and other information of interest to
*4 lie public.
; In addition to the general delivery room
there isa reference room containing 5000
volumes and affording special facilities
for study and research, a periodical and
reading room and a children's department
containing selected books suitable for
children's reading. In -the basement, on
the Park-avenue side, is the newspaper
0 room; where tbe current local and State
papers are kept on file. To accommodate
resiaents in districts remote from the City
Hall a system of branch libraries is
maintained. There are five of these, so
distributed as to bring tbe library' within
the react} of the largest possible number
of people.
Daily communication is maintained be
tween the branches and the main library,
so that borrowers residing in the vicinity
Os a branch can send through it to the
main library for books and return tbem
in the same way. Each branch .is
equipped with a small but carefully se
lected collection of popular books, some
good reference works and a number; of
periodicals. Thus, in addition to serving
as distributing stations for the' main
library, they are in themselves able to pro
vide for the ordinary wants of many read
ers. â¢
The by-laws of the library provide that
"the trustees shall have a seal, the device

Mechanics' Snstiiute ,
When the Mechanics' Institute was or- '
, â¢â¢ ' * ' .
ganized, December 11, 1854, its avowed
object was "the advancement, protection
and improvement of the mechanic arts
and sciences." and the object,' broadened
to include the "establishment of a library
of circulation and reference, a reading
room, the formation of classes and delivery '
of lectures," has been steadfastly main
tained through all the vicissitudes that
have beset its path. * y >f ' v * < \;
It is not impossible that, without the
strong library interest to bind its members
together, the association might have met
the fate of the hundreds of "mechanics'
institutes" organized jjj throughout tbe
United States about this time, and which j
have for the most part failed' utterly, or
become a mere name. This institution
fortunately had men of persistent deter
minationâmen who gathered strength
from adversity, who with splendid courage
kept to their purpose through all discour
agement, and nurtured the infant associa
tion, born in the excitement and unrest of
those troublous times, it has reached
man's stature and can stand alone.
The library that in 1855 contained four
volumes presented -by S. C. Buekbee â
has, in 1897, 74,000 volumes. Surely these
men have builded well. The institute has
been a factor in the prosperity of the City
from the first. Its annual exhibitions
have done much to foster and develop the â 
industries of the City and State. Its i
evening classes were tbe forerunner of the
polytechnic school.
It has from the first bÂ°en independent
and unaided, except in one instanceâ the i
bequest from James Lick of $10,000 for 1
mechanical and scientific books. It bas â 
many plans for the future that will re
quire the same devotion and energy to
: accomplish that has been shown in the I
past. The library was organized and is j
j continued on the broadest lines that a lib
eral policy can devise. Tbere are no bars !
and locks between the books and reader; I
absolute freedom of access to all books is |
the rule and has been from the start.
j-- . .....
It is the members' library and belongs
to the many, not the few. Every encour
agement is offered to members to suggest
books for purchase and otherwise take a
personal interest in its affairs. As 'we
labor under the disadvantage of having no
complete catalogue the arrangement of
the books on the shelves must necessarily
be systematic and consistent. The fiction,
poetry, drama, essays and letters are
arranged alphabetically under each class;
history and travel, by country;, biography,
alphabetically by subject, and science and
the arts by a close classification of ' their
general branches. The shelves are labeled
distinctly, and as the reader may go
directly to the hooks the need of a cata
logue is lessened in â  some degree.- We
have numerous catalogues of other libra
ries, trade catalogues and bibliographies
of special topics, which the members are
welcome to use freely. ' y .' ; .' k â¢
In this era of the. printing-press there
are books in embarrassing profusion -to
choose from. The Sflecion of books that
shall ibe useful as ; well as entertaining,
always keeping the special needs' and ob
jeots of the institute in view, is the diffi
cult problem that faces the books commit
tee "constantly. -.-. The progress of knowl
edge in many departments is so rapid
that books are antiquated in a few years,
and it requires little less than inspiration
to determine which of to-day's books in
science and the arts will be available for
to-morrow's use. In the lighter litera
ture the task is easier, for it is realized
that, however much we may wish that
the ;â¢ general reader craved more solid

Jfcistory of the
7/fercaniiie J&brary
The handful of earnest young men who
held a meeting in this City in December,
1852, for the purpose of organizing a library
association, "builded better than they
knew." Their labors, fruitful at the out
set, have resulted in the checkered career
of many yearsâ now successful, now half
heartedâ the Mercantile. Library Asso
ciation, now in its spacious building at
the corner of Van Ne33 and Golden-Gate
I avenues in the very heart of the City.
In its early years the library was the
! meeting-ground of citizens with reading
! tastes, and so on through the vicissitudes
! of its forty years' life the people of San
j Francisco have regarded this library with
jan affection which perhaps is not be
' stowed on any similar institution in trie
| City. Many of its patrons of thirty, or
| mora years ago have been constantly on
j the members' roll to this date.
The collection of a thousand volumes at
i the start has grown to that of nearly
j 80,000, as recorded in the last annual re
j port. While the signification of the name
j "Mercantile" has sometimes bÂ»en mis
j interpreted it should ,be understood that
| any person of good . character is eligible
I for membership.
In conducting j the , library through all
these years lit has : always . been the pur
. pose of those in charge to maintain a col
lection of books which would oe credita
ble to the institution. True enough, the
ephemeral novel has of necessity been
shelved almost daily; but books of ster
ling value for .permanent reading or refer
ence have always had preference. With
How thankful am I that the white snows of age -

old painters; , its , thousands jj of". bound
volumes of the best, periodical literature
of the worldâ invaluable for reference; its
excellent collection of old dramas, rare
books of archaeology, travel; arid history
all these and' more give the Mercantile
Library of to-day a place in the front rank,
without a rival on this coast.' To the
casual reader, who may not be a' member
of the association, this may seem like ex
aggeration.- Those who know the facts
will raise no question. ; Â
The large, sunny, main' room of the
library, with' its numerous cozy alcoves
and comfortable ladies' . reading parlor,
has not its equal, we are told, for light
and cheer even in the elegant new build
ing of the Boston Public Library.
All these features, it would seem, are
conducive to a more than usual elevation
of the" tastes of those frequenting such a
nail dedicated to literature, science and
art. San Fianciscans, however, are not
unlike the rest of the world in. reading
matters. Here, in most libraries, fic
tion is the goddess whose favors are most
liberally] sought. The novel of "the day,
"Something New," is called for most fre
quently. While on the other hand thought-
ful arid painstaking students, searchers
after truths, are daily visitors who accom
plish much with less ado and to whom
the librarians delieht in extending a help
ing band- Inquiries for books which in
one chapter settle the perplexing ques
tion. "Is the majority always in the
right?" or in another chapter will demon
strate to a certainty that "Whatever is
was," are daily received and invariably
disposed of satisfactorily.
That in its career of forty years and
more the Mercantile Library has always
had the friendship of the reading com
munity goes without saying. Yet has it
had in the past, and has it to-day, the
support it deserves? More than once it
has had a narrow escape from death at the
bands of .those who have not always
wished it well. y Tc-day. the association is
handicapped, but its future is not consid
ered barren of j promise. y Surely the pride
manifested in local institutions by our
citizens of means. would be well directed
if extended to this library.
Let me vigorously -urge the friends of
the "old Mercantile" to see to it', that; it
fulfills the career of usefulness which lack

Sree treading- ffioam
The Mariners' Free Reading-room and
Library, situated the Mariners' Cnurch
at the ' northeast corner of Drum m and
Sacramento streets, was the first free read
ing-room opened in San Francisco.
It had its beginning in April, 1876, in a
room on the ground floor of tbe church,
and" was, then under the auspices of "the
Mariners' Free Reading-room ; Associa
tion. This association was formed of a few
business men who saw the need of such a
reading-room on the water front, and to
establish and maintain 9it gave ' liberally
of their own means and collected from
friends donations of money, furniture and
reading | matter, so that a cozy, pleasant
room was soon* drawing in the steps not
only of the "toilers 1 of the deep," but
others. â¢ -y' : 'X' i: ' â 
The prelude to the old "Rules and Reg
ulations" reads as follows: y : "V
. "This room is intended for a quiet and
pleasant resort for such â¢ well- behaved
people, male or female, seamen or lands
men, as desire to spend leisure' time in
useful reading or letter- writing."
The reading- was from the first
supported by voluntary contributions and
cared for by the Mariners' Church. In
1881, for financial reasons, the reading
room was removed to the upper floor of
the church, where it has remained until
the present time. It is a sunny, pleasant
room with a southern exposure. It has a
library of about 1000 miscellaneous works
and is well supplied with secular and re
ligious weekly newspapers from all pans
of the country, in various languages, _ all
donated. The City dailies are represented.
The Bulletin, Journal of Commerce and
Commercial Newsaredonnted. Exchanges
from -the coast towns, also from China,
Japan and the colonies, are brought in
weekly by a' faithful friend of the work.
Magazines and other reading matter for
outward-bound ships are also donated, and
furnish the reading tables before Â«oing on
their journey around the world. '; r
The letter-box kept for the convenience
of seamen is an important part of the
reading-r00m.,: Here letters, newspapers
and parcels ' from all parts of the globe
meet and are held until called for. Let-
ters are. kept s for twelve months and then
returned^ to ; foreign 1 a dresses, if given,
otherwise to the dead letter office at Wash
ington.' -.*''â¢â . l ':, y.-'*" .â¢'".'.->..â¢â .'.*
| Blanks for -money orders, are kept arid
money sent for seamen whose work; pre
vents them from attending to these mat
ter* in business hours. s . y.
a Free stationery is supplied to seamen,
for the room has come to be chiefly a re-*
sort for seamen and tbo-e whose employ-"
ment on the docks gives them frequent
leisure hours which I hey are glad to oc
cupy in reading. "The reading, matter
most in use is the magazines and news
, papers,' although standard works from the
1 library are often j called for. V Shakespeare
is a' favorite with many a plainly dressed
man and Milton and Young are read.
Some of Emerson's most profound books
have been given to the j library after being
welLTead.s by the sailors who presented
them, y for. there y are : both â¢ reading, and
thinking men in our coast trade as well as
in deep-water ships. . ;
Evening sees an influx of men from the
foreign shins in port reading or writing
letters home, chatting quietly in groups,*
and often going back to their ships heavily
laden with the package of reading that is
to relieve dull hours at sea. '.-'â¢/
Odd characters sometimes drift into the
quiet room the flotsam and jetsam of the
ebbing sea! of -life. ".-.. Tue half-crazed beg
gar with long locks, who fancies himself a
street preacher; the quiet man who
writes diligently for hours, as though
writing a book, but is really scribbling non
sense; the man who comes in at pirently
for a good nap, and whose snores are both
loud and deep; the umbrella fiend, and
last but not least, the book fiend, under
whose coat the Century and Harper's are
spirited away. :
But these are the few. The many come
in for quiet and rest and for the mental
food supplied by the great press, whose
messengers to-day are so abundant and
so free tbat both rich and poor may enjoy
a daily intellectual treat.

Pioneer Jubilee.
lltah Soon to Celebrate
Jfcer Semi- Centennial.
The 24th day of July, 1897, will be the
fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of the
Mormon pioneer Dand in the valley of the
Great Salt Lake, and will witness the close
of a five days' celebration which will prob
ably equal in magnitude and splendor any
other celebration ever given, west of the
Mississippi. On this occasion it is pro
posed by the people of Utah to do honor
to the handful of Anglo-Saxons who half
a century ago broke the first trail from the
Missouri River and wresting the wilder
ness from desolation laid the -foundation
for the present greatness of the, mighty
area between that river and the Pacific
Coast. ;-.-â¢ .
;â¢ Before the journey was undertaken all
that was known of the western portion of
the United States could have been, in
scribed upon the ivory tablet ot a modern
society belle. Vague rumors placed in
circulation by Coronado, Father E^calante
and La Hontoo of -wild humpbacked oxen
and great' interior seas were extant; but
the mighty mountains and the buried
wealth within them, the broad plains of
fertile soil, arid the great timbered areas
which have since, produced vast wealth,
were then wholly unknown. ':*.â¢ââ 
I! After the journey the trail was
brokenâ came the emigrant trains and the
pony â â  express, and the stage coach, and
the railroad, and with them gradually
rising higher and ; higher rolled 1 - the, wave
of humanity wiiich has peopled the West
ern 'empire and drawn through it the lines
of a dozen Or more populous and pro
duct ye States. â  -
i Jn the celebration of all this the people
of Utah will concentrate; their energies
and -.expend â¢ their moneys: in July next,
and such a celebration as it will bet ..It
will ' cost $100,000. | The ' pony express will
be re-established arid messages again be
sent overland in the old way.. The stage
coaches be dragged from their hiding
places and. pass once more over ."the .Ben
Holiaday trail." Those who are living of
the original pioneers will ;be present and
half a century alter the day of the close of
their memorable pilgrimage they will
again enter the Salt Lake Valley by the
old road in the old way. In fact it is in
tended to reproduce true to life every step
taken by civilization in this region since
the settlement in 1847. All of the strength
and vigor and enterprise of the people of
Utah will be enlisted in this celebration,
for the intention is to make- it an event
which will attract National attention.
At tbis time it Is impossible to more than
outline the most important features of the
occasion. The work of preparation is in
the bands of a commission created by the
laws of the State, and no effort will' be
spared" to make the affair one of great
magnificence. * , T ' '
The people of the United. States are in
vited to participate in the celebration. y It
will occur when Utah's scenic and climatic
splendors are at their bestâ when -the
many colored garments of harvest are on
her fertile valleys and when bathing in

The latest. novelty in -the line of time
keepers .will ; appeal- to ; lazy people. Llt
consists of a watch that does' not require
any winding. All that is necessary for its
owner to do in order to have the time with
him always is to walk half a mile a day.
The watch does the 'rest.%-^f Xj-X XXX ;-
y^ These novel watches are got ; out in
several varieties of cases, some of { them ,
extremely ornamental, but the kind most
commonly seen in Chicago is made with a
plain black case, and an open face. The
.winding; mechanism consists^ of an in
genious contrivance by - which ; a small
weight is raised and lowered from the; jar:
of walking. motion of the weight
works a small ratchet arrangement which,
winds the spring to its full tensions and
then is automatically held until more
winding is needed. A course of shaking .
up: and down for a few minutes will .
answer the same purpose as a stroll afoot,
while all the, jolts? and. jars of ordinary
existence are likewise made. useful as a
m ans of winding.
The possibilities which this new watch
opens up for forgetful and lazy pc -pie are
enormous. * The man who \ come 3 * home
late at night by an irregular course of pro
gression down \ the , street, will no longar
need > to ; have his wife \ wind his. watch , in
order to -keep Jt going, and . the more tem
pestuous and: full of ups and downs his
evening -< has -;< been the ; better the" watch
will be wound. The student, college pro
fessor and young woman sin love will all
be blessed with a\* perfect-running time
piece, no matter how often they forget' to
wind it before going to J bed at night.
Above all, society -will he delivered from
the .; necessity of hearing the remarks of
the fool man who says he doesn't carry a
watch simply because -- he is too lazy :to
wind it. â Chicaeo Tribune. 'â /â â *- â¢â¢ I â '

Well, we have decided that it is to be a
badgeâ not a button, stick pin or rosette â
a badge to be made of silver, I think, and
to be pinned on the lapel of coat or dress,
so that it may be worn equally well by
boy or girl. Of course this little badge is
going to cost a faw of those precious
nickels and dimes which you have put
away so carefully, but I do not know
exactly just how many yet. y'X

J\ Story for Jim* Qirls.
A little girl by the name of Blanche
Hastings lived in the town of D . Her
papa and mamma were veiy kind to her
and she had a. beautiful home.
Now, you think she was a good little
girl. Well, so she was â that is, pretty
good; but alas! she had one very bad'
'.ault, and this fault one day made her
quite sad.
â¢ Just think, every time her mamma
called her or told her to do something, in
stead of saying, "Yes, mamma dear; I
shall come right away," she always said
"In a minute!" and then would go right
on with her play or reading and forget all
about her mother's command.
Of course this made both her papa and
mamma feel very badly and they did not
know how to get rid ol that naughty "In
a minute," but one day Blanche got pun
ished, and now I'll tell you all about it.
One bright Saturday morning she took
her lovely new story-book out into the
garden. "Oh, won't 1 have a fine time
reading!" said she to herself. "I'll lie on
the lawn under the willow tree and no
one can find me."
She was soon settled ; and commenced
her story, but bad not read long when she
heard ncr mother calling, "Blanche!
Blanche! Come here, dear." "In a min
ute," answered the little girl and turned
back to her book.
She read and read, and read, until she
finished the story. Then she suddenly
remembered that she had been called
some time before.
Walking slowly to the house she met her
mother just returning from a drive.
â¢ "Why, my little daughter, didn't you
go with the girls?" she exclaimed in sur
prise. ' >
"Go where?" inquired Blanche, a dazed
look coming across her face.
'Why," said Mrs. Hastings, "your
three friends, Daisy, Ethel and Belle,
came over for you to go with them to
spend the day in the woods and gather
wild flowers."
"Well, I think you might have called
me!" cried Ethel. Then Mrs. Hastings
turned to go into the house as she said,
"So I did, my child, but you did not seem
t o be in any hurry to come, so I suppose
they thought you were not very anxious
to go with them."
. "Well, I forgot we made it up last week
to go if to-day were pleasant, and I did
want to po so much
"I'm very sorry," answered her mother
,'and I suppose they concluded you were
angry with them for some reason and
didn't care for their company. I told
cook before I left for my drive to fix a nice
lunch for you to take. Let's ask her how
long the little girls waited."
When they entered the kitchen Blanche
saw her pretty little picnic basket all
' packed, standing on the table. She gave
a little sigh and the cook exclaimed:
"Well, Miss Blanche, where is it yez
hay been? Shure, the young ieddies were
. afther waitin' a whole hour fur yez. And
' shure it's mad at you they be!"
"Oh! mamma, what shall I do? lam so
ashamed bf myself. I see what a naughty
girl I have been to you now.'' .
"Yes, Blanche, .mam ma. has not been
able to trust her litt'e girl for a long time,
but I think to-day you have learned the
much-needed lesson that cheerful, prompt
obedience is always the best course to
pursue." - ' E. Ropnke.

An Outing at Hoopa
Indian Reservation.
BY CCMMIXGS DICKSON
(llyearssld).
In the summer of 1895 I bad a chance
to visit the Hoopa* Indian Reservation.
The day we - took the trip the air was
clear and we had a : beautiful view as we
went down the â¢ hill into the valley. y Yel
low grain fields lay below and stretched
away on all sides to the feet of the our
pie hills in the distance. Here and there
tbe grain was gathered into golden
sheaves.
The authorities of the reservation occupy
he buildings of Fort Gaston, which are
kept up by the Government. Captain
Daugh tery was the chief officer, but in
1892 the soldiers were all removed from
the fort. ' yy.
We arrived just in time to witness the
closing exercises of the borrding-school,
where the children are taught to live as
white- children do. We were informed
that many of them, after they return to
their homes, try very hard to carry out
the ideas which they learn in this school.
Squaws from all parts of the valley were !
in attendance at the exercises and seemed '
to enjoy them very much.
Kindergarten methods are used in the !
primary grade and the little fellows were i
very busy this day comparing their work, I
and seemed to have taken great pains
with their drawing and writing, as some of ]
their papers were really beautifully done. j
At the last they had some singing, and
good singing it was, too.
Then they were given prizes, which had
been offered by their principal, Mr. Came- |
I bell. There were two sets of prizes, one j
| for the girls and one for the boys.
The successful ones were very happy j
and departed for their homes with smiling 'â 
i faces.
As we drove through the -valley we
learned that the Indians have both saw
and flour mills, which they operate them- I
selves, and also that they harvest their I
own grain. '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 21, 1897.
. The Government has done a great deal
for these Indians. The land is divided I
into five-acre farms. One farm, which
consists of two and a half acres of bottom
land in the valley and two and a half acres
on the hills, is given to each person. ;. <; v,
Trinity River, runs right through the
valley, and its waters are so muddy that I
do not understand how the Indians ever
catch any fish; but they do manage to get
a great many. ','. â  :â¢.; Xl'-X'
As I was walking ahead of the rest of
our party along the banks of the river I
saw an old Indian chief, whom they call
Captain John, standing in the water with
a big club in his hand. He was waiting
for a fish to come ; near so he might knock
him with the club. He did not see me at
first and I enjoyed watching him for quite
a little while, but when he did catch sight
of me it was funny how quickly be
grabbed his salmon and scooted up to his
cabin, where he got into his pants [I for
got to tell you that he wore only his shirt
while fishing] and stood ready to receive
the rest of the party. .
He was very kind and showed us the
salmon and eels in his smokehouse and
offered us some. But we declined with
thanks, as they were in the condition we
call "spoiled." This old chief had once,
with a few other Indians, been taken by
some white men down to San Francisco,
and he continually talks about his trip to
the big, big City, and the wonderful
things he saw.
Well, our day came to an end, so we
<Â«ai.l good-by to our dusky friends and re
turned to our homes witb the knowledge
that the Hoopa Indians on the reserva
tion, with the exception of a few in the
upper part of the valley, live in general
just as white people do. .V, '.'*"'_

Bronzy, the turkey, scratched his ear; :
" It is time I was up and thinking,", he said,
" For Thanksgiving day is drawing near, ;'y'y -'
And I must contrive to save my head."
Then Bronzy, the turkey, thought and thoug ht
He ate a bug and he thought again ; . yX.; v-
At last this truth to his mind was brought:
The pets of the children are never slain.
For a week he shadowed the kitchen door,
Inwardly restless, outwardly blaud;
He submitted to squeezlugs from Sally and
Noah,
And he ate his meals from the baby's hand.
So Bronzy, the turkey, lived to see
A happy old age, you may depend;
For with turkeys or people olest Is hs

MARCH.
March, you're a jolly good fellow, I know ;
They may call you a blustering old chapâ but you blow
For us boys and our kites, and we don't care a fig
For the hat and the dust that go dancing a jig.
Puff out, you old fellow, blow hard or blow high, ..'.'â¢
At our kites you may bluster, and "blow them sky-high 1"
Nobody will find fault but the girls .
And they make a fuss 'cause you "blow out their curls !"
You're just our own seasonâ we've waited for you
And our kites are all ready, so strong and so new!
You jolly old fellow, if you were a boy,
You'd know why the March-month gives us such joy.
It is fun to stand on the top. of a hill,
And pay out.your stringâ let it run with a will ;
It is fun to "hold hard" while your kite pulls away,
And the wind blows a gale ! ah, kite-flying is gay. X-Xy
The ladies complain that you "blow off their veils,"
But never you mind, give no heed to their tales,
Devote yourself wholly to boys and their kites, .
And trust to the boys to fight hard for your rights.
For, March, you're the jolliest old fellow we know,
And.we like you better the harder you blow 1 -
When you marched in upon us we gave you a shout,
And we'll miss you at last when 'tis time to march out! . xx
Wide Awake. V
Jennie's Masquerade
The othnr day when Mr. Fisher, our
new clergyman, came to call he left bis
shiny silk bat and 'fur mittens in the hall
on the rack. "
.. Now, , ever , since Cousin John's cha
rades Jennie has been wild about, "dress
ing upland "acting." ;-:
The moment she saw the hat and gloves
the fever seized her, and in is very short
while she had pulled on the gloves, which,
of course, were much too large for her, and
set the great black hat over her ears. â 
Then taking papa's biggest walking
cane in her hand she strutted right into
the' drawing-room, where; mamma was
talking to j Mr. Fisher. Â Â
A more surprised clergyman you never
saw. It didn't take mamma long to cut
short that masquerade '; I tell you. I fear
Jennie would have fared even worse than
she did had it not been for the entreaties
of the kind Mr. Fisher.

March's Call.
BY MAUD L. BETTS.
"Ho-o-ol Ho-o-o!" March was. cer
tainly Calling some one. Who could it
be? The children came out; flew their
kites and rolled their hoops, laughing
when the wind blew their hats off and
made them race down the hill after them.
But still he went on calling. It must be
some one else he wanted.
The birds were too far away, most of
them, to hear him. Who could it be?'
Down under the ground there was quite
a commotion; little rootlets were spread
ing out this way and that, and there was
such a whispering and laughing going on.
What was the matter?
Why March had been calling the flowers,
and they were all awake, beginning to
grow with all their might; and having
such fun over it, you would have thought
it was all play. They were in such a
hurry to push their way throngh the
ground and brighten the world with their
blossoms.
"Are you ready? It's time we were
starting," called Snowdrop, her voice
fairly bubbling over with laughter at the
thought of the surprise she would be
when she popped her head up. 1
"Yes, yes," called the others, "go on,
we'll follow you." .
"It's too cold for me to go just yet,"
said Crocus, "but I'll be there as soon as
dear old Bluebird begins singing." XXXy
"I'll brini* my silver and gold blos
soms," cried Narcissus.
"And my bells will be ringing before
your blossoms fade,", laughed,' Hyacinth,
and; she laughed ". so ; heartily . that her
nightgown split open and gave two root
lets a chance to creep down in the cool
earth and find* some 'food for the little
plant. ;T â¢ **" --;â¢Â»- * .-
Violet was so busily at work growing
IP*}. : she did not talk as much as the
others, but the '.' very 'first' morning (she
popped her head in its violet bonnet above
the "ground; arid ' whispered, "I'm - here,*'
the ' .whole ? air grew ; sweet t with her
fragrance arid the children said : "Spring
has ; come, for the â â  violet's ;â  here." ' Dear,
brave little flowers; tbey never grumbled
all through . the ; ionp, 'â } cold ( winter that
they had to stay under the ground; they
were sure that the 'loving . Father who
gave * them.: their work to do knew what
was * best ' for them. * Their long' resting
time helped them to work better.' So,
when March V called, were ' ready to
jump up and go happily and busily to
work growing, so that soon they ' might
brighten the world with their blossoms.
No wonder they laughed and were so
happy.â From Kindergarten News.

THE LETTER
BOX
Blue Canyon, Cal., March 1, 1897.
Dear Editress and Readers of C. R. C: I was so
glad to see my last letter and puzzle in The
I Call. I shall try to make all of my letters in
teresting. I noticed Genevieve Sengstacken
writes an interesting letter from La Jolla, in
which she tells of many things not seen by us
lam going south some time to visit my aunt,
who lives in Monterey County, then maybe I
can write something interesting from there to
The Call. But as it is at present I shall tell
you what I can of this town.. Blue Canyon is a
little place of about 100 Inhabitants. We have
a nice schoolhouse, two hotels, a section-bouse,
a small repair-shop. As this is an inspecting
station the telegraph oflice, the post and Wells-
Fargo offices arc combined. Sixteen families
live; here. Some of the men are miners and
others work for the . railroad company. My
papa is one of the Inspectors.: The railroad lo
comotives take -water heie and the water is
purer than any in the county. In summer
a great many tourists visit this place for their
health. As for me I like the idea of having a
"roll of honor" and shall work faithlully for a
place on the record. Your constant reader,

Sierra City, Cal., March 3,1897.
Dear. Editor: In this letter I .have some
more to tell you about snowshoes. These are,
I consider; one of the best things to travel on
in the 'mountains. These are generally about
8. 12, 16 or 18 feet in length. My snowshoes
are about 9 feet long, and my brother's are
about B}-i feet. * Dope ' for the snowshoes is
made in different ways; one of these for dry
snow is to take a piece of. beeswax about half
as laree as the palm of your hand, an ounce of
camphor, a piece of resin as big as the bees
wax and a teasooonful of coal tar. These are
to be melted and then let boll for two or three
minutes. Next, pour it .into > a can or a glass
to cool. This Is a pretty, fair dope for j dry
snow. Dry snow is light; and is bad snow to
travel tnrougn. This is all I shall say this
time about snowshoes. * I would like to ace
long letters from members of the C. R. C.
about large cities they live in, as this is a
small village. Your reader.

IHOW ai\ li\diai\ duller -Produces a Bicycle
From Beneath His Goatâ Mar- 'Â
velous Tricks
RRAYED in a *Â°* of : spotless
Â»I&1 >â  white, his coal black hair covered
__\J_J by a showy. turban with many
loids, an Indian juggler, who calls him
self the Nawab of Jellabad, has been
startling the people of Paris nightly with
a marvelous trick and then poking fun
them with his explanation of how simple
it is to ao. Not so simple a trick, perhaps,
to the unskillful,, for it is S nothing less
than the production of a bicycle from be
neath that flowing cloak, where the great
est doubters in all the audience would
have sworn no bicycle could have been
concealed.
Most marvelous of all the details of this
trick is the undoubted fact that what the
juggler does he accomplishes unaided. His
assistant companion, who he declares is
the Rainee of Champaranâ although the
'statement is contrary to the rite of suttee
as practiced in India, for a Rainee is a
queen widowâ stands in the wings, if it is
on a stage, or at one side, when in a pri
vate house, merely watching the per
formance and smiling at the wonder cf
the astonished auditors.
â¢ There is something about this exceed
ingly clever man which makes one re
spect him instanter. Tall, with that clear
olive complexion which is charteristic of
the high caste Indian, he bows to those
before him in a fashion that is positively
princely and makes one wonder whether
is really what he claims to be, a Na
wab. The true Indian Nawab is a prince
in all that the word implies, if he is not,
in fact, more of a king. The chances are,
however, that our gentleman of the olive
skin is a juggler of more than usual brain
who shrewdly believes that the atmos
phere of former royalty will give him the
entree where the plain Indian juggler
would fail of an audience. .-' ..
After the magniticent bow comes the
wonder. If any one who reads this has
ever seen an Indian jug ler arrayed in all
the glory of his paraphernalia he has an
idea of how preposterous the assertion
seems when the necromancer, in very ex
cellent French, states to the audience that
he proposes to cause to appear before them
by magic a bicycle, complete in every de
tail. Not only, he says, will he cause this
bicycle to appear, but will also ride upon
it, and thus demonstrate the fact that it is
no imaginary or "property". machine. It
shall' be equipped with pneumatic tires,
he declares â in fact, just such a wheel as
the ardent cyclist loves to own.
inasmuch as it is manifestly impossible
to carry a bicycle in one's pocket or under
the arm without being seen, the onlookers
puzzle their brains in vain to disc ver how
on earth this seemingly remarkable man
is going to carry out the promise he has
made. They are not long in discovering
that he means to perform exactly what he
has promised. Suddenly there is thrown
to him, by his assistant, a large sheet oi
ordinary muslin, folded. He unfolds this
sheet in full view of them, bowing politely
'to those who are watching him, flings it
â¢SIMS-DUDLEY PNEUMATIC GUN-BREECH MECHANISM.
over himself and disappears beneath the '
â¢muslin cloud.
The disappearance is, of course, only so
* far as the view of the juggler unobscured
is concerned. Beneath the muslin he re
mains, but the muslin is in plain sight of
everyone and too far from anything to
permit even the suggestion of. aid from
an outside source. The cloth undulates
like the tall grass on a rolling prairie
when, the wind is blowing in stiffi<h fash
ion*. There are regular billows of cloth.
Then here and there appears a suggestion
of some object. All at once the muslin
shows the distinct outline of wheel.
Then the excitement does become intense.
''Why, the man is really going to do it,"
, is heard on all sides.
Th" cloth moves more violently. A click,
click sounds clear and distinct from under
(the muslin. Then the cloth shakes vigor-
Ipusiy. Suddenly it rises as if impelled by '
; a dozen hands and almost simultaneously
with that rising there darts from beneath
it the figure of the juggler, riding a silver
â¢ mounted wheel, upon which he makes the
circuit of the stago several times. Then
he alights as deftly as the greatest of trick
1 riders and bowing to the audience says,
"Mesdames et messieurs, s'il vous plait."
It is done. The juggler has kept his
word to the letter. And now for the ex
planation. The Nawab smiles in his most
charming Indian fashion as he tells those
who are about him that what he has done
is the simplest thing in the world if only
it is. understood. "Any one of you could
doit, I am sure," be says. Could they?
â¢Let us see. This is the explanation, con
densed from the elaborate fabric of lan
guage which the Indian juggler rears for
the enlightenment of those who have
PARTS OF SIMS-DUDLEY PNEUMATIC GUN BEFORE ASSEMBLING.
watched him. In a word the secret is that
the bicycle, all in pieces, is hung -about
his body beneath the cloak. * It seems as
If it would be a difficult task to do that' so
that 'there would 'â ',- be no knobby:; projec
tions, but the Indian is a clever man.
To -begin with the rubber tires are al
lowed to empty themselves of air, and are
then coiled about the man's waist;* Each
of the spokes folds in three pieces, and
thus condensed about the hub of 'the
wheel, the whole hangs down toward the
man's heels like the uig pendulum of a
clock. Aluminum is the metal of which
the wheel and the rest of the machine is
constructed, as largely a3 possible, and of
course this makes the hub and spokes
much lighter than would otherwise be the
case. This part of the wheel is secured to
the juegler in such a manner that al
though it hangs down, it wili not oscillate
so violently as to become visible, or to
give evidence ot its presence beneath the
folds of the cloak.
The handlo barn are fastened about the
waist. The frame of the machine is in
five pieces, but fits together with snap
locks that make it as firm as if it were all
cast in one piece.. The chain is wound
around his legs, and the sprockets are at
tached to the same limb. The saddle is
carried over his breast. As this is divided
so that it spreads out, it enables the jug
gler to wear it without danger of having
the presence thereof revealed.
With all this upon him, weighing per
haps altogether eighteen pounds, the jug
gler has appeared before those who have
come to see tbe wonder bo has promised.
The folds of bis cloak so thoroughly con
ceal the dismantled bike that there is not
the slightest evidence of its presence. The
usual explanation is made and then comes
the enveloping with the sheet. Instantly
the sheet covers him, the juggler loosens
from about him the sections of the bicycle
that make a complete whole. First of all
he arranges the frame. Then the two
wheels are quickly turned into proper
shape. Following this he blows air into
the rubber tires and adjusts them. Then
comes the gearing, the adjustment of sad
dle ana handle bars, and, 10, the wheel is
complete and ready for use. Then the
juggler dextrously flings the sheet from
him and at the same moment mounts the
wheel. The rest ha* been told.
This is the story of the event that has
interested Paris society high and low. It
is the revelation of a wonder and the ex
emplification of human credulity so deftly
combine i that it charms you while it
arouses your indignation. As this indig
nation is always directed toward your
self, the juggler is in nowise disturbed.
Therefore, the Nawab of Jellabad and '.he
Rainee of Champaran have become. both
popular and prosperous. Theirs is the
most clever of all the juggling feats that
Paris has seen or many a long day.

Such an invention was the Gatling gun.
A no less remarkable weapon, the Sims-

hilate everything within a radius of fifty ;
feet or more. The number of men affected
by such an explosion will depend largely
on the number of y flying- missies pro
duced, and ;â¢ this . is necessarily limited.
! But against material objects and earth
-1 works tbe result is bound to be disastrous.
: Nothing can stand against a well-directed
-hot. '-'â¢ The use of high explosive or tor
peao shells in the next war has for some
years been â¢' recognized . a broad, " and , forts
are now built -with; special reference to
tbeir ability to withstand them.
Ever since the practical development of
the modern high explosives, such as dyna
mite and . elatine, it has been the dream
of ; enthusiastic s inventors to apply these
aoadly agents in warfare.. Besides the
actual effect of a shell filled with a high
explosive there was the moral effect to be
produced by the explosion of a substance
having six or seven times the force of
gunpowder. Even the bravest and best
disciplined troops are apt to Â»become de
moralized in the presence of an agent
which nothing can resist.
As a propelling agent in guns the high
explosives, in spite of long-continued ex
periments, have proved unmanageable.
Efforts were therefore directed toward its
use in some form of shell. For this pur
pose gunpowder is entirely unsuited, giv
ing -high and irregular pressures and a
dangerous temperature. Some propelling
agent was needed which would start the
projectile rasily and give a continued
pressure during all the time it was in the
bore of the gun. With 500 pounds of ex
plosive gelatine and a sensitive cap it
would not .do to make ..mistakes. Com
pressed air was found to be in most re
spects an ideal propelling agent and a
long series of exhaustive experiments led
to the perfection of the pneumatic dyna
mite gun adopted as part of our coast de
fenses.
While compressed air serves admirably
there are many serious disadvantages
connected with its use, which will proba
bly confine the pneumatic type of gun to
permanent works of defense. Its only ap
plication thus far on shipboard has; been
on the, United States steamer Vesuvius.
To work the guns an elaborates plant; of
engines, boilers, air-compre3sors arid stor
age tanks are required, making the sys
tem very vulnerable as well as expensive.
A well-directed shot would put a whole
battery of guns out of action for an indefi
nite period. The' pneumatic gun is there
fore entirely out of the question in ; field
operations, while the inherent (defects "'i of
the system hava ted to many attempts to
fire the high 'explosives from ordinary
powder guns, using powder charges. :-r .
in the Sims-Dudley gun this problem
seems to have been solved at last, and the
principle is as applicable to the light guns
for field service as to t;iose ; of ? heavy type
for permanent works or use on shipboard.
Curiously enou ih the propelling agent is
air, which was found to * work , so success
fully, before. For the cumbersome plant
of engines and compressors a small charge
of ordinary powder is substituted. i Its'
ignition produces ; an ; air, pressure , which
starts the projectile and? forces* it safely
out of the bore arid ou its way. The gun
is hence a self-contained and complete
weapon, available in any situation, ashore
or afloat. X';-\':Xl-.-
The first public trial of the new weapon
took place last- April. Then a 4-inch gun
was used. The results were highly satis
factory," but unfortunately a defective fuse
caused a premature explosion and demol
ished the gun after a few rounds.
The new 2}Â£-inch gun weighs only 270
pounds, or with carriage 550. Its length
is 10 feet. At first sight the gun appears
to have three barrels, but on closer exam
ination the middle and longest one is seen
to be the main one and contains the pro
jectile. The right-hand barrel ,is con
nected at its forward end with the left
hand one and this in turn with the main
barrel. The effect is that >of a very long
barrel. The charge of six ounces of ordi
nary powder is placed in the tube A, and
by its explosion compresses the air column
in te two outer tubes A and B. , By the
connections shown in the -cross-section
this pressure is communicated to the pro
jectile, wuich is thus moved without
shock, while owing to the small c arge
and long chamber there is an almost en.
tire absence of smoke and noise... These
features ' of the gun, combined with its
lightness and portability, /doubtless ac
count for the d fficulty the Spaniards are
reported to have bad in locating the in
surgent batteries. ...
As the gun ,is a smooth-bore, some
means must- be found to produce the ne
cessary rotation Â' of the ', projectile during
flight. This is effected by adding a tailor
vane. As soon as the projectile leaves the
bore the resistance of the air causes the
rotation. i .'-"",-"'
The projectile, including tail,- is >34
inches long, weighs 11 pounds and carries
a charge of 4 pounds of explosive gelatine.
Next to this main charge is placed a six
ounce detonating charge of dry guncot
ton, which â  itself is nearly. as powerful an
explosive as the gelatine. Explosion of
the shell is produced by a mechanical
fuse. When the projectile strikes a steel
ball is driven forward, ; igniting a percus
sion-cap. This ignites a i train of slow
burning powder, which in turn communi
cates the flame to some fulminate of mer
cury, which explodes the guncotton.
This in turn detonates tbe main charge of
gelatine.
The lightness of the gun will make it of
great use in a rough or mountainous coun
try. By dismounting It the parts can bs
easily transported:* on 1 two mules. The
number of parts of the new weapon Is sur
prisingly small, and its general simplicity
enables it to be manufactured at low cost
and in short notice in, any numbers re
quired. â' .' ?
While, owing to the small : number of
fragments produced by the shell on explo
sion the new gun Is not J likely to i super*?
sede the present field gun for general use,
it will form a most valuable auxiliary, and
for certain purposes, such as demolition,
of houses, bridges, earthworks, etc, it will

The Human Electro- Magnet
Marvelous Gure for Rheumatism and Other
y Complaints of Mortals; by Scientific
; ' l Methods : ": : '. ;;
Â¥fÂ£Â¥r*UMAN '?â  MAGNETS? Yes, ; hat's j
p"J/ what they are. Human electro- .
Ju^Xp magnets. Electricity has leng been
used as a remedial agent in its application
to the human body, but it has heretofore
been employed as a local' treatment, the
current being .transmitted through the
tissues, so that the nerves and muscles
formed a portion of. ytbe ; electric circuit.
Now comes a Frenchman of -scientific at
tainments who discards old ''methods
and treats bis patients with the inductive
effect of powerful currentsâ making them,
in fact, "actual electro-magnets. â¢ Some
marvelous cures of that terrible enemy to
man's enjoyment of lifeârheumatism
are claimed for the application of Pro
fessor Monet's discovery. - : y. : ',
The practice of "medicine" is as yet
largely experimental. > This 'is no reflec
tion upon the ability of p physicians. The
medicament which may afford relief to
one patient utterly fails in its purpose
witn another. ;yA few so-called "specifics"
are claimed, but the' action of even these
is always ; largely modified by the condi
tion and the idiosyncrasies of the mdii
i vidual, a fact well illustrated iin the ail-
I ment termed rheumatism. Physicians
are divided in opinion as to whether rheu
matism is an affection of tbe blood, the
nerves, the muscles or the bones, whether
its manifestation results from an abnor
mal condition of one of these, or of a com
bined disarrangement of any two or all.
In the meantime a large army of sufferers
will hail with -gladness any reasonable
method of treatment which promises
relief. -â¢ X .:. -xIXXyy "X
Recent discoveries of properties of elec
tricity have stimulated many minds to a
further and more comprehensive study of
electro-therapeutics, and Professor Monet,
whoisan intelligent student of this branch
of science, bas reached certain conclusions
which he bas embodied in his electro in
ductive treatment. He claims that the
presence of the malady is due to a paucity
of carbon dioxide in the system, and that
the lacking quantity may be reaaiiy sup
plied by polarizing the arterial circulation
under the 'â  proper application of electro
magnetism, resulting from a current of
high tension. -â â /â - xmXiix^yX -
The apparatus for administering the
treatm nt is extremely simple.: It con
sists of a coil of fine insulated wire form
ing a helix 6 feet long, having an internal
diameter of about 36 inches, the walls or
layers \ of. wire being about 4 inches, in
thickness. The patient is placed inside
this coil, his body forming the "core," so
to speak, and tne coil then connected with
the secondary wire of an induction coil of
extremely high voltage. Under such con
ditions Professor Monet claims . that car
bon dioxide is formed in the blood with
great rapidity, with the gratifying result
that rheumatic pains disappear, the chalk
nodules are reduced, and with continued
treatment the ailment is eliminated. The
beneficial effect is not confined to the par
ticular ailment ; mentioned, but is said to
THE HUMAN MAGNETS,
be efficacious in a number of other
maladies. The electric current is at
no time using the human tissues as
a ' conductor. In fact, it does not
contact with them! ; What is employed is
the presence of the magnetic field created
by 'the current, and in which the patient
is actually bathed. The treatment is said
to be peculiarly beneficial in all kinds of
neurotic aliments. ;^ No ; evil effects appear
to ' follow. â  The patient ' under treatment
experiences at first a sensation of rapidly
changing temperatures, which soon gives
place to a feeling of delicious warmth, un
der the effect of which ho quickly passes
into a dreamless} slumber, which usually
continues for; some time after the treat
ment ends. He awakes to find his pains
departed and in their place a sense of
buoyancy. c â â ""./ ** -~ '- ~. . .

of Professor Monet's coils becomes an
actual electro-magnet i< proven by numer
ous tests. The old â  belief entertained by
some people that sleeping "' your head

is indorsed by, this new discovery. There
are no patents preventing the application
of Professor Monet's method by any 'one
desiring to do so. V ' F. . M. C. y .

;;J^eW Use for Homing pigeons.
y Dr. Charles L. Lang of Mertden, N. Y.,
has set the"-: pace for ; â '; all other I prac
titioners by establishing y' a carrier
pigeon service between ;, his patients
and himself. There is nothing in materia
medica, to be ' sure, which suggests this
method of practice, but it is such A a nov
elty in its way and it proves so successful
that once generally known It is bound to
prove popular. '' ' -
Every man who is a physician and baa
a practice 'that takes him about in the
country districts to any great extent
Knows ( how : hard it is to keep himself
thoroughly posted as to the condition of ,
his far-away patients. The city physi
cian's clientele as a rule is more com
pactly located, there not being the oppor
tunity for him to' practice in so large a
territory as his country brother. Now the
country physician practices over an im
mense extent of territory,' infinitely great
er than nine out of ten of even his own
patients think. ;He is quite likely to have
two patients critically.' ill, the patients be
ing, twelve miles apart an 1 each living
a like distance â¢ from the doctor's own
home. -Easily it will be seen that paying
daily calls and keeping ported with sick
persons scattered about like that becomes
almost an impossibility.'.: -
. These conditions confronted Dr. Lang
for many a long year, and he cudgeled his
brain to some purpose in finding a way to
help himself and at the same time prove
a benefit to his patients. The homing
pigeon solved the problem. In other
word-, the ' doctor is : the producer, the
pigeon is the middleman and tne patient
the consumer of medicine.,^lhsthis par
ticular instance, however, the middleman
benefits botn producer and consumer, a
state of affairs as singular as Dr. Lang's
project. .y' ,'.'â .' ". . - . '-,'
The doctor has found time to keep up
on medical topics, take good care o. his
patients and cultivate , pigeons, all three
very successfully. It is. the success,. or,
rather, the combination of successes, tbat
has. made life easier for him, more tran
quil for his patients and a source of amuse
ment and interest to every stranger who
hears what is going oh. . The 'doctor' says
his plan is a thorough success,' and he rec
ommends brother practitioners to try it.
There is nothing difficult about it at all.
The method of procedure is j this: yln the
first place the doctor keeps in mind con
stantly the patients whose condition he is
anxious to be . thoroughly posted upon.
Then he sends to each of these one or
more of the carrier pigeons, according to
the severity of the case and . the necessity
of. frequent communication. The nurse,
or some member of the family of the per
son who is ill, has blanks which the doctor
has left, and these must be filled in with a
detailed record of time,, pulse, tempera
ture and respiration. â  A blank filled, it is
inclosed in an aluminum capsule made to
clasp on the leg. This done the bird is re
leased and at once speeds away to the
home of the waiting physician at the rate
of a mile a minute. In this connection it
is well to remember that while to the un
initiated the words "carrier pigeon" in
-1 elude all pigeons, that carry messages, in
reality they do not mean that. The bom
ing pigeon is the carrier pigeon trained to
actual, solid, hard work. '' j,
I When the pigeon of the medico reaches
his destination, Dr. Lang's residence, he
flies to the loft, which has been prepared
especially for him and his comrades. â  In
order to gain 'â  this loft, however, he must
pass through what are called bolting wires.
These open inward into an inclosure about
two feet square Here the prisoner is held
until the doctor or some one designated to
perform the service removes the message.
The pigeon then is free and flies into the
loft :. ' Â-.â ".â¢- . .'â --â¢- >/.*,â  "
In this way Dr. Lang is enabled to keep
thoroughly in touch with "his patients at
a distance with about one-filth the amount
of travel he would have to endure â  under
other circumstances. Not only that, but
he Is really much better posted, because it
would often r happen -that he would alto
gether be unable to pay visits to all the .
patients \ he should, and so, perhaps, miss .
seeing a sick person at just the time when
he - most t needed 'â ;;. to hear from v him, at '
least. : Under the system he > has devised
be can go, away from ; home \to visit pa
tients and feel sure that when he returns
reports will be awaiting him from others.
Should these reports tell him that a call
from him is an absolute necessity, 1 why,'
then, he goes, and that is all there is of it.

AT
THE
THEATRES
f^^HARITABLE societies exist for the
Jfwft protection of nearly every class of
â¢ |ta-v^ â¢ the community that is likely to be
crushed under the heel of the oppressor â
even animals have their society but the
opera-goer, poor unfortunate melomaniac,
bas no society to look after his rights. He
Buffers in silence and buries his woes in
his own breast. Byron said: "Society is
now one polished horde, consisting of
the bores and bored." The opera-goer
who loves music belongs to the latter
class, and ' his oppressors are the bores.
They do not trample on his rights with
the bloodthirsty desire to lacerate his
feelings and tear his patience to tatters,
but they get there just the same.
When opera ceases to be an exotic, as
it is in California, and becomes a part of
the people's life, as in Italy or Germany,
the bores will drop out of sight Some of
them will be converted and will go to
opera to listen to the music; others will
know better than to while 'away the per
formance in conversation, because public
opinion will be too strong for them. At
present the bores are so largely in evi
dence that I have noted down a few of the
most familiar types, to give the oppressed
opera-goer the cheering conviction that
he has companions in misfortune. -
There are the people who look upon the
commencement of the overture as the
signal for an animated conversation.
They do not seem to be at all aware that
opera-lovers consider it a sacred duty to
listen reverentially to every bar of the
overture, and that it is just possible the
neighbors may be of this number. They
talk and talk until the curtain goes up,
"and then they subside for a few minutes,
only to burst out with renewed ardor
when the singing' is growing most tender
and pathetic. " : Personally I have learned
more about people's private affairs since pig orcnestra ana obtain a confused

cant seats in a back row. They have come
to enjoy the music, because they have a
copy of the score, which they have been
following . intently. Their departure does
not disconcert the lady who has seen the
opera before. She keeps up her running
commentary to tne bitter end, and those
who cannot escape the sound of her voice
sit there with murder in their hearts and
wonder resentfully why Shakespeare
wrote "Music hath charms to soothe the
savage breast."
More in pity than in anger does one re
gard the people who laugh in the wrong
places -in the operettas. â¢ Their education
in French has been neglected, and they
think to hide the fact by bursting out into
skittish giggles whenever any one else
smiles. At "3ii3s Helyett" there were two
girls in' < my vicinity * who laughed
hilariously as regular as clockwork at the
end of every, sentence. Their manner
seemed to say: "We understand it all;
isn't it funny? He! he!" And the girls
never knew that they had chortled -in
their glee at remarks that â well, there are
things in "Miss Helyett'' that those girls
would ; have resented fiercely if they had
been Â«aid to them in the common or vul
gar tone, and as for laughing at them in a
theater the Lord forbid. Hut as Ferris
Hartman once sang "The poor girls never
knew." 'â '. X-.X.y -'â ".';'
When opera ceases to be an exotic, its
patrons will not only be freed from the
bores, they will learn,, to w, A to ; enjoy it
themselves. At present * fashion â  has de
creed that the orchestra is the best part of
the house. It has hitherto been the most
expensive, therefore it is ; the best.; If you
have the courage of your convictions and
go up to v the balcony, or the top gallery,
you need not trouble to appear en toilette,
because fashion' scorns the upper .; regions.
As your friends see you ascending, they
are apt to say, "Poor thing! she is ac
tually 'going up there." And then they
co and Â» sit within y a '-. few feet ;' of % the
big orchestra and obtain a confused
impression that the score consists chiefly
of fantasias on the trombone, and that the
drummer does more work than all the
other men in the orchestra combined,
while yon sit up aloft, in the. back row of
the gallery if need be, and the sounds
come to you, blended by distance so that
you enjoy the idea of the ensemble of
voices and instruments, and go home im
pressed with Ue fact that the California,
although it is such a little bit of a' place,
does not make such a bad opera-house
after all.
'Of course regular habituss of the big
European opera-nouses talkâ in their own
boxes. .People who have been fed and
nurtured on opera from infancy take .the
old repertoire homeopalhically nowadays.
They have seen "William Tell" fifty time?
at least, and know every bar of "Norma"
by heart, so it would be too. much to ex
pect them to sit out the fifty-first perform
ance in silence. They just drop in to hear
whether tne much .'be-puffed new tenor
really takes Arnoldo's high D in the chest
register or criticize an up to-date soprano's
singing of "Casta Diva." After their
curiosity is satisfied they go away, or talk
and to that end were boxes made. Woe
betide spectators in places where opera
is not an exotic if they talk in
I the orchestra, the gallery or any other
| parts of the house where they can annoy
their neiehbors during the performance.
Audiences are not possessed there with the
idea that "this is a free country, and a
man can talk if he wants to." For patience
and charity that suffers long and is kind
commend me to a California audience.
The California i Theater â not being
built, alas! on the opera-house plan â bas
; no conversation-proof boxes to which idle
I babblers can -be -relegated. In the
dim future we may have a 'real opera

â¢ * â¢ Explanation.
Tbe arrow flies with the wind. The top figuiÂ«*j
at station md lea. c maximum temperature for the'
days: those underneath it. if any. the amount of *
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,'
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid)
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word ".hieh" means high barometric pressure and -
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is uÂ«ually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us-, ally first appear on the'Wasblngton
coast. When the pre sure is high in the interior
and low along tbe coast, and the isobars. extend
north SAaa south alone the coast, rain Is probable:
but when,. lhe â¢â )..Â«,' Is Inclosed with isobars of
niarke-JTetrrvatisre.- raln'SWHb of Orfgon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California roast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer, and colder
â¢weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result- - '

CHICAGO, &x. March 20 â The strength
Of wheat shown at the close yesterday was still in
evidence at the opening this morning, although
prices were a trifle oft from the final figures then <
quoted. L verpool reported i,4d a! vance, winch j
waa not sufficient to show full rellec. ion with our
advance; the week's shipments from both coasts
were light at 1,629 000 bu&hels, and Argentine
exports, 304,000 bushels, were tetter than they
have recently been.' These factor* would or
dinarily cause the tone to display easiness, but the
10.-al speculation sentiment is pr nouncedly 10
favor of higher-prices; and th buying this morn
ing was unquestionably superior 10 the selling.
Recelfts in the Northweit. were heavier at 372
cars against 109 last Saturday and 661 a year ago.
Chicago received 13 cars and inspected 33,766
bushels. The tone was Irregu ar 1111 11 sear the
close. ivhÂ»ti options beiame heavier* prices
dropped t-jc under y< steraay's close, par. a cables
were ower, Antwerp unchanged and Berlin lower.
Export clearances at Atlantis ports were fair at
808,406 pushes. May wheat opened Irom 7i>c to
74'j.c Bo.ci between 71>iÂ±c and 78%e, closing at
the Inside %c under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for Monday 20 cars- No. 2 red. spo:, wneal
84% cto 9J%c, closing about 84%@39%c.
COitXâ lhe bul. lsh sentiment lv corn showed,
no abatement this morning. 'Ihe receipts, 101

hold Policeman George' Dougherty to
answer. before the Superior Court on the
charge ot manslaughter, fixing his bonds

Dougherty shot and killed Henry E.
Sullivan in Lunstedt's saloon on O'Farrell

carousal.
The Judge pointed to the fact that the
evidence showed Dougherty.^ had tried:
twice to get out of :. the saloon , but was
prevented by Sullivan, who was evidently,
anxious for a h-^ht. He did not consider
that any malice had been shown and
therefore;; he would hold him to answer
to the charge of manslaughter.'.

PASSING OF A
LOCAL HERMIT
For Nearly Two Months
His Body Remained "
Undiscovered.
He Has Livid Alone for Seven
teen Years in a Clementina-
Street Flat
S veral Pathetic Letters From His
Aged Sister in Morrisville, Ver
mont, Found.
A case worthy of .more than ordinary
note came into the hands of the Coroner
yesterday. The body of a hermit named
D. M. Gilbert was found in the third fiat
of a brick building at 174 Clementina
street. The man had evidently been dead
for the past two months, but the thick
walls and closely barred . doors ana win
dows prevented the neighbors living in
the same house from Knowing that a dead
body was under the same roof.
For the past seventeen years Gilbert,
who was about 70 years of â¢ age, bad lived '
in that flat, .which consists of three small
rooms. But little was known of the ,
! recluse, who was scarcely seen away from
his bouse. When he left his rooms It was
usually early in the morning and his re
turn was as a rule after darkness had set
in." How be lived no one Knew, and but
few even knew his name, for he avoided
1 his neighbors as though the ; entire world
was his enemy. It is believed that he
gathered and sold bottles to help keep
body and soul, together.
Harrison Gilbert, always paid his rent,
.which was $10 a month. Sometimes he
would pay two or three months' rent in
advance, and the agents, Crim & Co., and
the owner, J. F. Bright of 13 Verona place,
would not see or hear of the strange tenant
for a long time. This was what happened
in the latter part of last year.' Old man
Gilbert made his last payment to Decem
ber 31. â  ; When . his i rent was again due a
note was sent to him, but he did not re
ply,- which', caused no ; comment. , ' When
two and a halt' months passed and the
tenant failed to appear in response to the
notices, Mr. Bright started to investigate.
.Yesterday he went to the bouse and forced
open :tn I rear door. The 8 body *of y the
aged tenant was found lying on the floor in
an advanced y stager of â¢- decomposition.
Deputy Coroner Halle t; and y Messenger
Smith went for the body and used as they
are to such cases tnis one nearly over
powered them. * , ,
Dirt and ;^ filth, rags and old bottles,
broken furniture and a tumbled-down bea
were the principal features: of the | scene.'
Among Gilberts- effects were a number of
letters from his sister, Louise L. Kutlier
lord 2. of 1 Morrisville, ; s Vt.7 and j those i were
the only writings that connected him with
the, world or indicated who he '* is. X} From
the letters it 'is interred that Gilbert' and
his sister '-Â were all that remained of the
family. They showed that it was the* sis
ter who had all these years paid the rent
for the hermit. The last letters, dated in
February^, were unopened. X It was appar

Tialfic Conducted by Rogues ;

â â .â¢-â :>' r-- â â -
Judge Carrol. Cook delivered a stirring
lecture on the subject of half-interest
swindles yesterday morning when passing
sentence on J. M. Jackson, convicted of
obtaining money, under false pretenses.
So many of these rascals have made
their homes in this community for. several
years, and so successful have been their
operations ~ and ; their * attempts to evade
the punishment provided by law, that all
good citizens will be glad to hear that at
last one of the horde is about to get what
he deserves. y.
The testimony disclosed the fact that
Jackson held himself out to be a medical
expert, and in this guise induced an inex
perienced man to seek his vice for med
ical treatment of some minor ailment.
Although that act of itself might have
been punished yet that was not the ground
of tne complaint filed against Jackson.
Ascertaining that he had not deprived his
victim of all the spare cash in his posses
sion JacKson offered to sell a half interest
in his "business" ] for " $300 and obtained
$75 as part payment. >.y '
Of course the "business" proved fraud
ulent and unreraunerative as its character
was exposed and no new dupes could be
found who would pay cash for worthless
nostrums. , â '
â¢ Judge Cook touched on ' the '* pertinent
facts ; of the case in ; passing ; judgment.
The court said: y .' â¢/''Â»-*â¢
Your record, consisting of four prior convic
tions, evidences the fact that . you are past
reformation and that you lead a criminal life
from -~ choice â â -â  and .7 not y necessity.* J Leniency,'
therefore, in your case would be wholly out of
place. Since confinement twice in the State
Prison ' aud twice : in , the *â  County Jail ; have
failed to teach you others in the world
beside yourself have rights which are to be
respected, it is plain to be seen that the In
terests of; the community would p* be ? best sub
served by sending you back there this time
for permanent Incarceration. When a 'person
is brought into a criminal court for the lirst
time I am always inclined to be, and I am.
lenient 1 and often, w he i they. come for the
second time," I scan with great care and caution
the evidence adduced against them, for I real
ize thatthey may either have baeti tempted
by, want, resulting from their failure to obtain
employment by reason ot their being ex-con
victs, or *: that ; their previous ; records might
have caused suspicion i unjust to attach. to
them; 1 but, f, when t they are brought into a
criminal ? court t for J the % third time, or & the
fourth, as in your case, no such considerations
can maintain; it is then clear that they are by
nature > criminals, and _ s that the > community
should be rid of their presence In it for the
', future. 1 â 'Â»'*' '.* *. â ,'; ,;t "X, ':-â - .*" 'â y'r^'^'^,:'X-im.yX.-'.i
'. For the crime iof which you have been cou
victed, with but one of the prior convictions
which 1 are I charged | against you, , and which
you have admitted having suffered, a sentence
of life imprisonment could be imposed, un
der the law, and the shortest term permissible
y-X,.y ;â¢'â¢,' HAU- BROS <â'!
would be ten years. If each of the four priors
charged were to be treated in the same man
ner , forty â¢ years' imprisonment would be
the minimum for the crime. 'â¢ .
On your trial you deliberately committed
perjury in denying your signature to the docu
ment introduced in evidence, in swearing that
yon saws Morrow and Xiklrk sign certain
papers and in other matters for which, if you
were tried, the lowest punishment possible, in
view of you:- prior convictions, would be four
teen years' Imprisonment. '. And, ; not content
with adding such crime to the list, of which
you hnvj been guilty, you offered in evidence
and uttered two forged paoers in support of
your false testimony, the uttering of each of
which would subject you. with your prior
record, to a minimum imprisonment of fifteen
years or tnirtv years for tne two. â â â â¢â¢â¢ ,
Were you to be tried for tbe several crimes
just enumerated, which you have committed
right here in the presence of the court in de
lending yoursilf upon the charge of which
you have been convicted, your punishment, in
connection with the punishment imposed for
this crime, taking the minimum for each,
could no: be less than ten years for this crime,
fourteen years for perjury and thirty years for
two i forgeries, making an aggregate of fifty
lour years. . ,
In addition to these facts in aggravation of
your offense, the evidence adduced here shows
that the complaining witness here 'was the
third victim from the country whom you had
fleeced within a period of about four months,
no charges having been made against you by
the other two. Had those crimes been added
to the list, twenty years' additional imprison
ment, taking the minimum 'Uowed by law
would also be added, making seventy-four
years in all.
Judge Cook also referred to the brazen j
perjury committed by the defendant and j
said'ihat it was the intention of the court
to deter such .perjury if possible *by in
creasing the punishment of all convicted
persons who had the temerity to swear
falsely, even though testifying in tbeir
own behalf. In this regard he said:
When one has lived a life ;of crime, as you I
have, such an example should be set as snail I
show others that their presence in the com
munity will he dispensed with should they
follow'in a like path. Likewise is it necessary
that others should learn that if they, in de
fending themselves on accusations, or in en
deavoring to maintain accusations, In this
court, commit willful perjury, as you. have,
they cannot do so and go unwhipped of jus
tice, lor, as I have heretofore stated, where a
witness testifies to what 1 am satisfied Is false I
I shall, regardless of who fie may be, officer or i
citizen, send him lor trial for his crime, and i
when a defendant attempts to | avoid convic- I
tion by such means I shall increase his pun
ishment in such a way as to deter others from
following his example. â '.'-
The evidence also shows that the business !
in which you were engaged was one which, !
although not declared by law to be criminal,
is one wherein the unwary are fleeced of .their
money and is a business which is a disgrace to j
the community and which ought to be de- j
clared criminal even if it is not. >
During the giving of your own testimony I
you brazenly 'slated that,: in your business, j
you had "worked the City by sections," and j
that the disreputable character of that bust- I
ness was such that even you were ashamed to
conduct' the same under your own name, lor
you say that at one place you conducted busi- j
ness under the style of the "English Remedies
Company," but that "there was no company,"
that you "ran the same ; yourself," thereby ad- i
milting thai you even conducted your busi- i
ness under false pretense. . â¢; ,; >---y\
It is certain that at your age you could not
'live to serve the full term that your crimes I
call for, and although 1 could send you In \
terms for life Imprisonment.- such penally Is j
one which I deem proper to reserve lor crimes \
of a, character.; different than that for .which i
you have been tried. But I will fix such an ;
imprisonment as shall, at your age, virtually j
amount;, to life .imprisonment, and which
shall be sufficient to operate Â«s an example j
and a warning to others : not to io.low in your
footsteps. â â  :, %^^^B3^g^S^fp^^^^^9B i
