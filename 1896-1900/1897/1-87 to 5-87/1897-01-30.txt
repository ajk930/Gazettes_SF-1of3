Secured.
ROSEBURG, Ob.. Jan.,29.â The South
ern Pacific northbound Shasta express, of
which trusty Sam Veatch was conductor
and Richard Morris engineer, was flagged
two miles north of this city last night by
three masked highwaymen, who boarded
the engine, covered Engineer Morris and
Fireman Hendricks with revolvers and
assumed possession of the train.
As Morris shoved a trace of hesitation
' in complying with the orders given him
by the highwaymen he was induced to
change his mind by a bullet, which burned
the side of his cheek and caused him to
reverse the lever without further formal
ity. Firemen Hendricks took in tne sit
uation and jumped as the train was slow
' - ing down. ' A bullet whizzed by his ear as
he stumbled down the dump, but he rolled
to the bottom in safety and hastened to
Roseburg with the news ol the hold-up.
After Engineer Morris had been fright
ened into submission he was relieved by
one of the robbers, who displayed consid
erable skill in manipulating the locomo
tive. The baegage and express cars were
uncoupled from the coaches and the latter
, shunted â¢ backward with considerable
energy. Running the baggage and ex
press forward some distance the robbers
stopped, uncoupled the engine and in
- vited the express messenger to open his
doors. This he refused to do and dyna
mite was quickly applied
'Suspecting what was being done Mes
senger Butler opened the door on the op
posite side from which the robbers were
operating and jumped from the csr just as
the explosion took place. He held a re
' Tolver in his hand and discharged it at
1 the robbers without effect as he flea down
I the track. The explosion wrecked one
â  side of the car and overturned the oil
lamps, setting fire to the woodwork.
â â  . The robbers, succeeded in opening the
two small safes in the burning car, but
were unable to reach the large or
"through" s*fe. which, with its valuable
contents, soon dropped through the burn-
King floor and settled between the rails, in
a position where it could not be touched
Until the flames were extinguished. The
little safes were broken open with dyna
mite cartridges and looted, but it is not
believed that they contained any curiency
or valuables.
Meanwhile the mailcar caught fire and
one end of it was badly charred. The rob
bers, finding that they conld obtain noth
ing more worth righting for, slipped away
in the darkness and disappeared down the
banks of the Umpqua River, where it is
supposed they had concealed a boat, on
" which they made their escape.
It was shortly after 11:35 o'clock that
the overhand, on time, reached a point
two miles south of Roseburg known as
Sheridans farm. The train was in charee
of Conductor Veatch, with Rear Brake
man Lone. Engineer Morris and Fire
man Hendricks had charge of the engine
and Frank K. Butler the express-car.
On reaching Sheridan Field, or Shady
Point, as the stretch of track is sometimes
called, Morris noticed on the track ahead a
man with a lantern, which was being waved
violently. The engineer at once shut off
his steam, bringing the locomotive to a
stop almost opposite the man with the
; flag.
No sooner had the train come to a stand
still than a masked man climbed over the
tender, and, leveling two revolvers at the
engineer, ordered him to do as told in
â¢ handling the train. Hendricks, the quick
. /_ _ :
BANDITS NEVER BOARD THESE TRAINS.
The American Express Company, to guard against train-robbers, has equipped
arsenal cars, which run between New York and St. Louis. They are provided
with bullet-proof rooms, in which armed men, firing through loopholes, could repel
a large force. The cars carry large supplies of implements of war, from rapid
tiring Hotchkiss guns to explosives which could be projected into a party of
raiders in the even i of an attack.
The San Francisco Call
witted fireman, on seeing the masked rob
ber making his way in:o the cab, dropped
down in tne shadow ot the tender and
t! ence crawled to the track. Working liis
w ay to the head of the engine, the fireman
started on a run to Roseburg, the two
miles being covered in less than tifteen
minutes. There he informed the people
at the station of what was going on at the
scene of the hold-up.
Superintendent Field fortunately hap
pened to be in .Roseburg'. Hurriedly gath
ering a posse of armed men he took an
engine iroin the roundhouse and hastened
back to tae point where the overland was
held. As the relief engine pulled out from
Rcseburg several heavy detonations were
heard and as it approached the scene a
brigiit glare was >een in the sky. Tnis
proved to have come from the express
car, the stove of which had been shat
tered by successive shuts of dynamite, ;he
co&ls setting lire to the car. Trainhands
were vigorously fighting the flames when
FielJ's engine arrived, but their efforts
avaiied naugbt, the car being completely
destroyed.
Following Fireman Hendricks' escape
the desperadoes orderei Engineer Morris
to "kick" the train back. Tbis done the
mail and express cars were cut off and
hauled ahead some fifty yards, chased by
Conductor Veatca and Brake man LiOhe,
who shouted to the engineer inquiring
what the trouble was. Their answer was
a fusillade of shots and tha command to
get back to the train. Neither seeming to
obey quickly enough another volley was
tired at them from the engine. The
whistling of the bullets left no mistake as
to the intent of t c people handling the
weapons and Veatch and his brakeman
beat a retreat to the train.
The express-car was tne first object of
assault by tne robbers, after they had
hauled that and the mailcar ahead of the
train. Receiving no reply to their second
d' mand to Messenger Butler to come out
side (he having slipped through the oppo
site door) a charge of dynamite was
placed under the car and tired. The effect
was ruinous. Doors were blown apart and
the heavy floor timbers shivered into
splinters. The car was at once entered
and the two small safes of the express
company attacked with giant powder.
Both of these were blown open â in fact de
molished, so heavy were the charges used.
The last load of dynamite, however, went
beyond its intended usefulness, the force
in some manner being exerted toward the
car stove and sending the burning coals
flying in every direction. These, alight
ing among the paper-wrapped packages,
at once set the interior of the car ablaze,
The robbers, finding their work becoming
too hot, made for the mailcar and entered
ir. Little damage was done there, they
evidently being fearful of occupying too
much time, inasmuch as the dynamite ex
plosion and flames from the burning ex
press-car must have been seen and heard
in Roseburg. A lew rifled mail pouches,
an evidently ignorant attempt at reach
ing the registered packages and the rob
bers prepared to leave the scene.
They did not propose being followed.
A rash movement of Engineer Morris in
thrusting his head through the cab win
dow earned for him a bullet-graze across
the cheek. A snarling growl from Express
Messenger Butler's big mastiff, at one of
the robbers, brought a bullet through the
faithful animal's brain. Numerous other
hairbreadth escapes resulted from the first
fusillade of pistol s .ots, which sent bul
lets whistling down the sides of the train
just as the startled passengers were pre
paring to alight to learn the cause of the
sudden stop. Fortunately none received
serious wounds or injuries.
On arriving at the scene of the hold-up,
the first movement of Superintendent
Fields was to tumble the burninc express
car from the track. Ere this had been
accomplished the end of the mailcar had
been suruewhat charred, but not badly
damaged. The cars stood near a small
slough, and from this the trainmen had
carried water and done valiant service in
protecting the mails. The express-car
was beyond saving.
Immediately a Sheriff's posse started in
search of the robbers, taking its course
from the report of a farmer named Lidd
say, who Btates that five men, carrying
lanterns, passed his place shortly af ler the
dynamite explosions were heard. The
men were not masked, but were evidently
anxious to avoid observation, they strik
ing off into the fields on Lindsay's ap
proach. The robbers, if such they were,
were making in the direction of Rose
burg.
The only lucid interviews from men who
were on the train were given by John J.
Wedtner and William T. Lewis, San Fran
cisco drummers who lost their sample
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY 30, 1897.
Engineer Morris of the northbound train from San Francisco on the Oregon and California Railroad was signaled by a man who stood upon the track and waved
a lantern. He stopped the train and it was at once boarded by outlaws. Morris was fired upon and slightly wounded, but Fireman Hendricks leaped from the cab
and escaped unscathed by the bullets sent after him.â [Drawn from a description telegraphed to The Call.]
trunks in the express-car fire. These gen
tlemen stated that they retired at 10:30
o'clock last night, and about an hour later
they were awakened by a loud report. At
tirat they deemed it of no consequence,
but soon a second report struck their ears
and at the same time they felt a peculiar
movement of their car. Then it was, they
said, that the outlaws were moving two
cars around the curve.
"I observed," said Lewis, "that there
were two men only engaged in the work,
one of whom flagged the train. After
that one of the fellows covered the en
gineer and fireman, with orders not to
move the engine. The tireman, though,
leaped irom the engine, intending to get
assistance from Eoseburg. He ran into a
barbed-wire fence, which fearfuily lacer
ated bis hands and face. All this time
the road agents were keeping up an in
cessant fusillade upon him, but he escaped
without one of the bullets striking him.
"Then they turned their attention to
the engineer, demanding of him to assist
them in gaining access to the express-car.
The messenger refused to open the uoor
on the side at which they were standing,
and the robbers began pouring shot
through it. The messenger eventually
got out of the other door and succeeded in
getting in two shots at the outlaws, but
missed tnem. They returned the com-
Piiment with equal result. Then a dyna
mite bomb was thrown into the open
express-car for the purpose of blowing
open the bis said. This explosion soon
started a fire that made a lurid glare
visible for miies around.
"Tuey got but little, as it was impossible
to get into the big safe. No, they did not
'go through' the passengers of any of the
cars. One jewelry drummer claims to
have lost $10,000 in samples in the fire."

Has Forced to Do tne Kidding of the
Train Jtohbers.
GRANTS PASS, Or., Jan. 29.âEn
gineer Morris of the San Francisco over
land train, which was boarded by bandits
near Roseburg last night, says the rob
bers were three in number. His story is
probably the most reliable of any that
have yet been told, for he was not permit
led to leave the r<resence of the outlaws
while they were at work.
Morris says the robbery occurred at
about 11 o'clock. The rain was pouring
down in torrents, and the train was mak
ing good time. Suddenly at a point
where the road runs close to the Unipqua
River with high banks on the other side a
light swung out ahead of the train and
signaled it to stop. Engineer Morris
slowed down. As be did so, crack 1 went
the report of a pistol ana a ball grazed his
cheek. A. masked highwayman clambered
up on to the engine and covered the en
gineer with his pistol. At the same time
another highwayman climbed over the
wood in the tender into the cab and cov
ered the tireman. The latter sprang out
of the cab as a bullet whistled past his
head, and made his way on foot to Rose
burg. A third masked robber then put in
an appearance.
One of the trio took cnarge of the engine
and showed a thorough familiarity with
its workings. The other two marched the
engineer between them back to the pas
seneer coaches and made him uncouple
the coaches from the express and baggage
car. They then returned to the engine.
The new engineer gave the uncoupled
coaches a vigorous kick, and then took the
express car up tho road about a half-mile.
Engineer Morris was kept under cover of
a pistol in the hands of one of the robbers,
and the other two made a demand on the
express agent to open the car. This the
agent refused to do. A dynamite cartridge
was then brought into use, and with the
tremendous explosion the door and one
side of the car gave way.
At this point the unexpected happened.
The force of the concussion wrecked the
stove in the car, and in a' moment flames
were seen shooting from the floor. Ex
pressman Butler was for a moment
stunned by the impact, but rallied shortly
and sprang out of the car on the opposite
side Irom the outlaws. As he did so he
exchanged snots with one of the bandits.
The invaders got into the car and tried
to extinguisti the flames, but found that
they were beyond their control. They
then turned their attention to the safes.
The smaller one was founJ open and was
rifled of its contents. It is not supposed
that they made a rich haul. This safe
usually carries the way packages from
points north of Ashland.
The Attack Upon the Overland Express Near Roseburg, Or.
The robbers then turned their attention
to the bi^ express safe. A stick of dyna
mite was placed under it, and the robbers
retired from the car awaiting the explo
sion. In a moment it came and with it
another burst of flames in the cars. The
two men again climbed into the car and
tried to force the safe open. They found
their efforts unavailing, and numerous
deep curses were uttered by them as they
perspired over :he job in the suffocating
smoke.
Engineer Morris says that the two ban
dits as they toiled in the hot and blinding
smoke of the car formed a picture that he
will never forget. The rain still pattered
on the outside and the glare from the
burning car caat somber shadows out in
the dark woods and over the smooth wa
ters of the UnipQua below. The flames
grew hottdr and hotter,* and the two nvÂ»n
realized that they would have to abandon
the enterprise. Another difficulty they
encountered was the heated condition of
the safe. This became so hot that they
could not touch it, and at last one of them
said :
"We will have to give this up."
They both sprang out of the car on the
side nearest to the river, and, with the out
law who had remained in the cab, went
quickly down and along the bank of the
river. This was the last seen of them. It
is supposed that they had a boat on the
river below, by means of which they could
baffle all attempts to follow them and
could in a half hour be mingling with the
people of Roseburg.
In the meantime there was great con
sternation among the passengers in the
rear coach. Many of them were aroused
from their sleep by the blast from the first
dynamite cartridge. It was soon reported
all through the coaches that the train was
in the hands of bandits. Terrified men
and women bid their valuables under tue
seats, in their boots and shoes and in
every place which they believed a sus
picious bandit might fail to search. Some
ot them showed their heads at the
windows, but a pattering of bullets warned
them to keep inside.
This robbery is conspicuous in that it
occurred within two miles of the town of
Roseburg, so near that the dynamite
blasts were plainly heard by the people on
the streeis. This is the second train
robbery that occurred in the south end of
Douglas County. Within a year the
northDound overland was held up at Cow
Creek and two masked robbers went
through the entire train, relieving the
conductor and crew and all the passengers
of their watches and small change. For
this crime the Pool Brothers, two hard
citizens of Douelas County, were arrested
and lodged in Portland Jail. At length
ther trial came up, but they were ulti
mately turned loose by Judge Bellinger of
the United States District Court before
whom they were iried.

ROSEBURG, Or., Jan. 29.â Up to a late
hour to-night no definite clews have been
discovered leading to tbe identification of
the miscreants who held up the north
bound Sortthern Pacific express last night.
Superintendent Fields is on the scene
personally directing the movements of
several posses, which are trying to pick
up the trail of tne robbers, but thus far
their efforts have been fruitless owing to
the heavy rainfall of the past twelve
hours. Detectives in the employ of the
railway and express companies are coming
from Sacramento and upon their arrival
more systematic efforts will be made to
run the fugitives down.
An unsuccessful attempt was made here
to open the Wells-Fargo "through" safe,
after which it was shipped to the com
pany's headquarters at Portland. The
metal 01 the safe was badly warped by
the heat and it is feared that at least a
part of the contents was damaged.

CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 29. â This was
Major McKinley's birthday, and he cele
brated it by tendering the portfolio of war
to General R. A. Alger of Michigan.
General Alger authorized the corre
spondent of the United Associated Presses
to state that be had accepted the portfolio
of war. He was asked if all differences
between himself and Senator Sherman had
been arranged.
"Yes," he said, "we are on good terms
and will work together in harmony."
General Alger arrived at 1 o'clock and
lunched with Major McKinley. Ex-Con
gressman A. M. Thompson of Ohio and
ex-Speaker Titus Sheard of New York were
the others. After luncheon General Alger
and Major McKinley retired for confer
ence, ana, at the expiration of two hours,
General Alger came out and made the an
nouncement that he was to be in the Cabi
net. He left for DJtroit at 4 o'clock.
General Alger was in a happy frame of
mind, and was apparently pleased with
the result of his visit to Canton. He said
he was not personally acquainted with all
the men who are liKely to be in the Cabi
inet, and said that three of them he did
not know by sight. He said the appoint
ment of Mr. Gage had made a remark
able impression on the business and com
mercial world, and would hasten the re
turn of confidence.
Ex- Speaker Sheard of New York talked
for two hours to-day with the President
elect. He said:
"My interview was a pleasant and very
satisfactory one. We discussed the New
YorK situation in regard to the Cabinet,
and 1 urged the appointment of General
Stewart L. Woodford, on the ground that
he is a clean, strong, capable man, about
whom very much that is good can be said,
and against him very little can be said.
He was acceptable to the organizations in
New York, and that fact ought not to
make it unacceptable to any fair-minded
citizen. Major McKinley bas a high opin
ion of General Woodford, and may ap
point him, but I do not think he ha 3 de
cided what to do in respect to New York.
My conviction is that New York will be
represented in the Cabinet by a thoroughly
satisfactory man."
Colonel J. J. McCook of New York, who
called on Major McKinley last night, is
mentioned to-day as a Cabinet possibility.
Major McKinley dinea wita his mother
to-night. Among Major McKinley's
callers to-day was G. M. Reynolds, a Dcs

Congressman F. H. Wilson of Brooklyn is
no longer considered a Cabinet possibility.
James Wilson of lowa, who has been
prominently mentioned in connection
with the position of Secretary of Agricul
ture, arrived here at 10 o'clock to-night
and drove immediately to Major McKin
ley's residence. Mnjor McKmley, who
knew Mr. Wilson when he was in Con
press, greeted him heartiiy, and they
withdrew at once for a private conference,
which lasted more than an hour. Wilson,
in all probability, will be offered and will

WASHINGTON. D. OL, Jan. 29.â
Judge Goff of West Virginia has written
a letter to a friend in Washington, in
which he says he will not be a member of
Major McKinley's Cabinet. He has con
sulted personally with Senator Elkins
and by letter with Major McKinley, and
has concluded to be a candidate for United

The Cabinet, as far as settled definitely,

Cabinet officers thus far selected are from

FREE FROM BLAME
Guy of San Diego Did Not
Place Any Names on
the RolL
Others Admit That They Gave
P.'ace-Seekers Permission
to Use Their Names.
Legislators Candidly Confess That
Excessive Mileage Was Paid
Without Protest
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 29. -W. R.
Guy, Republican Assemblyman from San
Diezo, has a clean record in the matter of
the temporary roll scandal. He was cred
ited on the list with the appointment of
Clark Alberti, bat he went before the in-
Testigating committee this afternoon and
under oath declared that he did not ask
Clerk Duckworth to make any appoint
ments on the temporary list.
Guy did not turn and twist and squirm
as did some of the witnesses who preceded
him, but he was as explicit as it was pos
sible for a truthful man to be. He said:
"I made no request to any person, nor did
I authorize any one to request the chief
clerk or any one else to put any one on the
temporary roll. It was intimated to me
by several members that I had a right to
! be represented on that roll and I told
them that I did not desire to have any
one on the roil."
He made the further explanation that
two years ago at his request Alberti was
appointed assistant clert of the Assembly,
but he did not know how he came to be
on that roll.
Strain of the committee swore that he
did not recommend the name of J. R.
Nixon, which was credited to him; nor
did he recomruend to Duckworth the
name of any other person for the tempo
rary roll, but he did solicit Duckworth's
support in aid of Nixon for a permanent
position. He was one of the statutory
employes of the previous session.
Power of San Francisco, a Democrat,
had two appointments on the temporary
roll. Two or three others bad gone to
him for permission to use his name in or
der to get on the roll. He voted for the
mileage report because he heard that the
report called for only $104 too much mile
age. He didn't t hin k. it was any use to
waste time about $104, and voted to pay it
with Democratic liberality.
Lacy of San Francisco raised a laugh by
declaring that in his district were many
colored people, and they had made bis
life a burden waking him out of bed in
the morning to have him place them in
fat jobs. He told them to go to Duck
worth and use his name for all it was
worth.
Harris of Santa Barbara said that he
<iici not recommend Rodriguez and Miss
Bertola, whose names were charged to
him.
Doian (D.) of San Francisco said that
he recommended T. J. Smith in a letter
to Duckworth. The other men charged
to him asked him whether they could
not use his name and influence with the
chief clerk to be placed on the list and he
told them to go ahead and use his in
fluence as much as they liked.
Gately, a fusionist of San Francisco,
swore tLat C. W. Kyle, Martin and Allen
asked him for permission to use his name
with Duckworth, and he told them to go
ahead and speak fur themselves. He was
on very friendly terms with the chief
clerk. He aid not expect to get any ap
pointments. If he had he would have
sent to San Francisco and got some good
Democrats to come up here and pose for a
day on a week's salary on a temporary
list.
Bookkeeper Hocking for thesergeant-at
arrns said he was allowed $114 for mileage
from Ban Bernardino. He came up from
there, taking a prisoner to San Quentin,
and the Sheriff of San Bernardino gave
him $50 to pay the expenses of both.
Ei-Sergeant-at-arms Parkinson recom
mended to the Mileage Committee that he
be paid $114.
Assemblyman Breiling testified that2
Parkinson represented to the Mileage
Committee that Hocking was a poor man,
had been obliged to come here from San
Bernardino and that they ought to ailow
tim mileage.
Hocking proceeded to tell how he and
Parkinson made up the list of names, as
published in yesterday's Call. He took
the list, to the chief clerk, and Duckwonh
said that he could not put them on; that
the incoming members were jumping on
him like jackrabbits to put men on. The
witness reported to Parkinson what had
been said, and Parkinson at once went to
see Duckworth about the matter.
Dibble, said he had no recollection o.
having recommended T. J. Smith, though
it ie possible that he did. He under-tood
that Duckworth had placed him on the
roll because Smith was a very efficient
man. The witness recommended to Duck
worth as page the son of a printer named
Donald Bruoe. He was appointed.
The witness voted to adopt the report of
the Mileage Committee. He understood
that thrre was $104 too much in the Mile
age Committee's report, and he had said
at the time that if it was a matter of only
$104 it was not worth while making a fuss
over, because there would be plenty of
opportunity to economize when it came to
making the appropriations-
Assemblymen L<eavitt, Kelly, Henry,
Vosburg, North of Alameda, Robinson,
Kenyon, Chyncweth and others testified
that they had recommended the appoint
ments charged against them on the tem
porary roll.
Janitor W. H. Govan declared himself
responsible lor the recommendation of T.
"W. Measure as electrician. His duty was
to turn on and off the gas and the electric
lights, and remedy tb.e trouble when the
fuses burned out. The fact that the tem
porary organization of the House was
effected before dark on t"he first day of the
session did not seem to ruffle Mr. Govan's
serenity in the least.
Judson C. .Brusie, attorney for the chief
clerk, announced that Mr. Duckworth
would appear before the commutes next
Monday an I make a clear and explicit
statement of the whole affair, which would
show tnat everything was fair and above
board.
The committee will meet again next
Monday. The opinion was freely ex
pressed after adjournment that judging
from the recklessness with which Demo
crats and fusionists had men placed on
the temporary roll it loofeed like a job by
the minority to manufacture political
thunder for the next campaign.

S. nator Smith, who represents Kern
and San Luis Oiiapo counties, nas a bill
in providing tor the cstab ishment of a
State Normal School in the latter county.
The measure Is now in the hands of thf
Committee on Pub ie Buildings. In dis

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1897.
Senators the author of the bill believes it
will a much better chance of going
ihroujjb if its provisions are changed so as
to create a State polytechnic school on
the plan of the Throoo Institute, a Dri
vate school at Pasadena. It will be the
only State Normui School of this charac
ter in California.
Speakmtr of the matter to-day Senator
Smith t-a.d: "Tne idea is to nave a school
I r training men and women in the every
day affairs of lifeâ not in those tnings
that iead to the professions, but those
wb eh lead back to the borne and pertain
to the daily vocations of life. The t'irls
will be train -d in domestic economy and
the care of the home, as well as in the
preservation of health and the care of the
sick. The boys will get instruction in the
mechanical arts and sucn other occupa
tion* enabling ihem to earn a livelihood
as the directors may see tit to apply ihe
institution to. Tne State a. ready has
numerous institutions for all who desire
education in the various profes-iona,
while there is not one distinctive school
to make people fit for the every-day places
in life."
During his visit to Stockton last week
Senator Sliippee had a peculiar experi
ence, and it led him to introduce a pe
culiar measure to-day. While passing a
drugstore in the city named ho saw a
man, who had been placed under the in
fluence of hypnotism, displayed in the
snow-window and serving as a sort of
drawing card for the business. Then he
heard that some of the boys of the town,
who had become infected witu the hyp
notic fad, had succeeded in placing a
Japanese playmate under its mysterious
p >wer and set him to playing baseball.
When they had become surfeited with the
novelty of seeing the wanderer from the
land of chrysanthemums wasting hiÃ
energies in an imaginary game, with
which be was entirely unfamiliar when
in a normal state, they tried to restore
him to bis natural condition. To their
consternation they could not make him
dessit nor get him out of his simulated
condition. It was only after procuring
the aid of a gentleman experienced in the
art that the Frankenstein-like Jap was
relieved.
These matters also came to the attention
of S. D. Wood, a well-known attorney of
Stockton, who before Senator Shippeelelt
handed him the following bill, which was
duly submitted o the Senate to-day:
It shall be unlawful foranyperaon.other than
a duly licensed physician or surgeon, as such
physician or surgeon is defined by law, to exer
cise, or Httempi to exercise, mesmeric or hyp
notic Influence upon any person or persons;
and any such physician or surgeon suall only
exercise such mesmeric or hypnotic influence
white engaged in the actual treatment of a
person tor some existing disease or ailment.
Violation of this act is declared to be a
mi demeanor, punishable by a fine of not
more than $500 nor less than $100, or by im
prisonment of not more than one year nor
1 ss than six months, or by such hne and
imprisment. It was referred to the Com
mittee on Hospitals.
Ex- Judge Van Reynegom and Marcus
Rosentbai are here in the interest of a bill
to prevent litigation by which hundreds
and thousands of property-owners are not
infrequently put to great trouble and ex
pense.
"Take such cases as the Noe suit," said
the Judge in explaining the purposes of
the bill which it is proposed to have in
troduced in the Legis ature. ''Here a
large number of people were forced to go
into the courts and defend an attack on
the title of their property witnout any
just or good basis existing for the action
of the complainant. They were forced to
employ counsel, give more or less of their
tim" to meetings and consultations and
suffered from a temporary cloud on their
titles, which prevented any translerof the
property involved until the case was de
cided.
"This bill provides that every complaint
in such a case must be verified and must
positively state the time when the com
plainant or his predecessors were last in
possession of the property. Such an aver
ment must not be on Lelief and informa
tion.
"If the defendant", or any of them,
allege that they have been for five years
in adverse possession of the property in
dispute and have t>aid all the taxes
thereon during such period, the Judge
shall require a bond oi $300 from com
plainant for each such deiendant to se
cure the payment of costs and $100 for
attorney's fees."
The measure has the approval and in
dorsement of the San Francisco Associa
tion ot Improvement Clubs.

STILL ANOTHER TREATY.
Great Britain and the United States to
Settle Their Boundary Disputes by
Arbitration.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 29.â A new
treaty between Great Britain and the
United States is being formed at the
State Department and will be trans
mitted to the Senate soon for ratification.
It agrees to appoint a joint committee
of engineers, surveyors, astronomers, etc.,
to collect all information bearing on the
subject and ascertain the exact location
of west longitude parallel 141, which by
common consent suall in all future in
ternal matters mark the boundary line
between the two nations.
The cession made by Russia to the
United States in 1867 and the treaty be
tween G eat Britain and Russia in 1825
are points to be nvestigated. The com
mittee is especially to investigate where
those treaties marked the boundary line.
- The findings of the committee are not
final, out will in all probability be ac
cepted by both nations as the determina
tion of the territorial dispute, which
involves some of the richest Â«old- bearing
country in the world.
It bids fair to mark the happy consum
mation by peaceful means of the two ter
ritorial disputps which two years ago
threatened to disturb the peaceful rela
tions of the two countries. It was then
alleged that Great Britain had set up a
claim to the gold fields of Alaska and of
Venezuela.
The latter controversy has practically
been settled and all authorities say Vene
zuela retains the gold fields. The Alaska
dispute is now in a fair way for so tle
ment. The general arbitration has been
b.ocked by certain Western and North
western Senators who di I not want
to see the Alaskan boundary dispute
brought under the general terms of arbi
trat on. The ne.w treaty was pressed for
ward at this time to except Alaska from
the general arbitration bill and smooth
the way for its early passage.

DOCTORS LISTEN
TO MR. CLEVELAND
Felicitous Address at Their
Semi-Centennial Cele
bration.
The President Says Some Wise
Things and at Times Waxs
Humorous.
Contrasts Physicians of To-Day With
Village Doctors of Fifty
Years Ago.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 29. â The
Academy of Medicine celebrated its semi
centennial in Carnegie Hall. The exer
cises consisted of addresses by Dr. Josep
D. Bryant, the president of the academy,
and by Samuel S. Purple, M.D., and Louis
A. Bayre, M.D., the founders of the acad
emy; an oration by A. Jacobi, the lormer
president of the academy, and an address
by the President of the United States,
Grover Cleveland.
The hall waÃ crowded. From the or
chestra to the topmost gallery every seat
seemed filled, the boxes being brilliantly
lighted.
"Hail to the Chief greeted the Presi
dent as he entered the hall on the arm of
Dr. Bryant, the audience rising out of re
respect to the Nation's Executive.
Bishop H. U Potter dressed in the pur
ple robes of the episcopate offered the
opening prayer.
President Bryant then made the open
ing address of welcome. Mr. Bryant ex
plained that the objects of the academy
were at once the purpose of fostering the
medical profession, to better the study of
medicine and the maintenance of a good
medical library.
Dr. Purple, Dr. Sayre and Dr. Jacobi
spoke on tbe aims and work of the acad
emy. ,
Mr. Cleveland was then introduced by
Dr. Bryant and spoke as follows:
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: I have
anticipated the share assigned to me on this
occasion with considerable trepidation for
several reasons. lam chiefly disturbed, I be
lieve, because ol my inability to discover suf
ficient ground for my right to join those who
celebrate the semi-centennial of a medical
association. If in passing through a period in
boyhood when the desirable choice of a pro*
fession seemed to rest between running away
from home and being a Bailor and staying at
home to be a doctor I inclined toward the
more quiet and orderly of these pursuits, this
surely furnishes no- basis at this late day for a
claim to relationship to the medical iraternity.
Nor do 1 forget that less than seven years aco
I was accorded the privilege ol participating
in the exercises when the cornerstone was laid
of the bulding which is now the home of the
organization which to-night celebrates its
halt century of honorable existence. It has
aroused an interest still undiminished in the
academy of medicine and hardly entitles me
to a share in the celebration of those who have
borne the work while I have enjoyed the
happy surroundings of public station.
Confessing, therefore, that I have no right
for even standing-room within the inner
circle of the profession, I have boldly and
without the least authority determined to
speak to you as a: representative of the vast
army of patients and laymen. Ai the outset
I desire to remind you that though it is
largely in the majority and with plenty of
members to spare, those who . are well
conducted among, us do; not vex you with
hurtful competition. Instead of making l.fe
bard for you, by observance of . the laws of
hctilth, we assist you by indulging in all sorts
of irregularities. We are obedient and sub
missive to your commandsâ that is, when we
are sick.â and we sometimes pay your bills,
even after a recovery to healthâ which we are
always certain would have resulted without
your interference. ...-.' .
Under these circumstances, if in perfect
health we venture to assert ourselves and tell
you what is in our mind it is not fair to liken
us to a certain personage who when sick a
saint would be, though very differently in
clined when well.
We begin by conceding most heartily and
without the least reservation the learning and
skill of those now constituting the medical
profession and the wonderful advance that
has been made through their untiring labors
and Investigations in the alleviation of
human suffering and the saving of human
life. â¢.
It may be that this seems to you an acknowl
edgment so much your due as to be hardly
worth-making. You should, however, value
it because it is sincerely made by those who
were not born yesterday, but who hold in last
ing and tender memory the ministrations of
the village doctor 01 fit ty years ago and are
now living monuments of his faithful care.
He, .100, alleviated suffering and saved tinman
life. We know mat it was not given to him
to see the bright lights that now mark the
path of medicine and surgery, but you cannot
convince us that he groped entirely in the
dark. . ' - â  â  â 
We remember with abhorrence his ever
ready lancet. We endure with complacency
the recollection of his awful medicine case,
containing bottles, powders and pills, which,
whatever might be thought of them now,
seemed then to be sufficient for all emergen
cies â to say nothing of the toothpulling tools
and â  other sniver-breeding instruments ex
posed to view. Ââ â¢
If he was ignorant of many of the remedies
and appliances now in we, he in a large mi as
ure supplied the deficiency by hard-headed
judgment, woll-observed, experienced and
careful nursing. Besides, it was in his favor
that he did not have to bother his head with
many of the new. y invented and refined
diseases that nfll.ct mankind to-day. He had
no allotted hour* for his patients, but was al
ways on duty, and we knew the sound of his
gig as it rattled past in the night.
Your way* are better than his, but we desire
you to regard this admission as all the more
valuable because it is carved out of our loy
alty to our old village doctor, who brought . us
through the diseases of childhood witnout a
relapse, '< who saved from death our parents
and our brothers and our sisters in many a
hard com l at, and who, vanquished and forced
to surrender, was present in the last scene to
close the eyes of his dying ' patient and sym
pathize with those who wept.
I hasten to say that we do not for a moment
suppose that advancement in the science of
medicine and surgery has smothered the
faithfulness and tender consideration which
characterized the practitioner of our young
dÂ«ys. If we seek charitable acts toward the
suffering and noble appreciation of our obli
gation to humanity and self-abnegation in
the discharge of professional duty, we must
look for them among our physicians and sur
geons of to-day.
We have now arrived at an understanding,
and you are, I hope, prepared lor a suggestion
quite in keeping with the extremely moderate
and reasonable disposition which character
izes the patient layman. ' You have invaded
our benighted : con ten iment and led us to
broad fie ds of scientific discovery. This has
inspired us with a new-born spirit of wisdom
and criticism which demands that new and
arg. r fields be. opened to' our complacent
gaze. V v have penetrated- the, place* where
the germs of disease are bidden, and we are
not quite certain that you should nut be re
quired to destroy the origin of disease and
ultimately usher in the dawn, where the only
escape from , the world will be through a
passageway mariced "old-age exit.
-If this has (ac appearance of exacting too
much, or if business â¢ prevents, I think we
should reduce our chums or at least give our
doctors, time to = find other employment. In
meantime those of us . who are conservative
must be allowed to hope that - farther investi
gation will continue to point the way to the
prevention of disease. "For this investigation
we mu.t sti.l rely v on the effects: of .those
who have already dÂ«.ue =>o much in that direc
tion, encouraged and stimulated by such effec
tive | organizations a i the Acad :m v of Mcdi- -
cine. We are sure that this work, haviuer ar
rest d the attention .of â¢ the world's brother
hood if medical science, will not be neglected,
nor need we lear that American's contribu
tion to splendid results wili be defic en
v In some Instances, however, - investigation
has performed its i art. and only ff.-c ive ac
tion in other quarters is necessary to supply
needed remedies. ;: In such cases, o i 'â â â  course,
you are absolved from: all responsibility in
your professional : character by exmblMng
dangers and ; warnings against, them. Thus
certain diseases whicn you deem contagious
yet remain imperfectly isolated. You iiuve
demonstrated the neril to health of unwhole
some water and noxious surroundings, und
yet much remains to be done i y way o pro
tecting our people against the c dangers. You
have established a code of ethics wh.ch con
demns charlatanism in all its forms, anÂ«l vet
icnorant pretenders roam over the land offer-
Ing to perform mime es, or are loc ted la our
towns and citus, preying upon the weakness
of tue sick and afflicted, while men and women
are allowed to die without nied cal attend
ance, deluded with the hope that faith will
save them in their extremity.
We cannot but think that the discoveries
and improvements in the medical practice
which we now enjoy are dearly bought if the
members of the profession, in their onward
march, have left behind them their sense of
civic obligation and their inierest in the gen
eral t>ubiic welfare. We cannot accuse you of
utter neglect of your duty to ihe country, and
yet we cannot keep out of mind the tnÂ»pielOD
that if your pro.essionnl work in exposing
evils was more thoroughly by
labor in the fieW of citizenship these evils
would be more speedily corrected
If laws are needed to abohsr. abuses which
vou^professional investigations have un
earthed, your fraternity should no; be stran
gers to the agencies which make the laws. If
enactments already in force are neglected, or
badly executed, you should not forget that it
is your privilege and duty to insist upon their
vigorous and honest eniorcemeut. Let me
also remind you of the appl. cation to your
case of the truth embodied in the homely in
junction, "If you want a job well done, do it
yourself."
If members of your profession were of tener
found in our Stnte and National Legislatures
ready to advocate the reformatory measures
you have demonstrated to be necessary, and
to defend your brotherhood against flippant
and sneering charges of impracticability, the
prospect of your bestowal u_pon your fellow
men of the ripened results of your professional
labor would be brighter and nearer.
While thus suggesting the need of your in
fluence in legislative circles for the accom
plishment of rÂ» forms related to your rro:es
sion you will, I hope, permit me in conclusion
to enjoin upon you the duty of an active and
general interest and participation in public
affairs for the promotion of your country's
good In all the phases. The Government was
founded on the faith and anticipation that
those who loved it most and were best able to
hold it steady would be at its helm. Without
this it will surely go astray.
Never did patient need your medical treat
ment more than the body politic needs the
watchful care of your patriotic and disinter
ested citizenship. No object of personal am
bition and no love for professional liberty
should make you withhold from the Govern
ment the titne and service due from thought
ful, intelligent and educated citizens. It is
your obligation to watcn and protect our free
institutions and preserve them from weakness
and decay, which will surely be done when a
just Government, supported by the patriotism
of a loving people, shall bestow with equal
hand upon us and all our countrymen the
blessings of National peace, contentment and
happiness.

WILL INVESTIGATE KRUGER.
Secretary Chamberlain Causes Common-
ers to Appoint a South African
Commission.
LONDON, Eno., Jan. 29.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day the discussion of tbe
question of the appointment of a commis
sion to inquire into tbe troubles in South
Africa was resumed. In tbe course
of the debate Eight Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of State for tbe
Colonies, declared that the position in
Bouth Africa was still unsettled, and that
during the last few months there had
been a recurrence and increase in tbe
growth of the feeling of unreat which must
be allayed.
Matters had been rendered much worse,
he saiÂ«i, by the action on tbe part of tbe
Boer Parliament and, moreover, although
President Kruger bad promised to ;Â»ive
favorable consideration to the grievances
of tbe Uitlanders, he had not done so.
Great Britain, Mr. Chamberlain de
clared, still maintained that peace was
insecure, and would remain so until the
Uitlanders' grievances were redressed. He
felt sure that an inquiry by a commis
sion formed for that purpose would further
these ends.
In reply to a question by Sir George
Baden- Powell, Mr. Chamberlain said tbe
Government, with the approval of her
Mnjesty, had invited tbe Prime Ministers
of the several colonies to come to England
and take part in the celebration of t c
completion of tbe sixtieth year of the
Queen's reign. [Cheers.]
If the inviations were accepted, Mr.
Chamberlain continued, the premiers
would be tbe guests of Great Britain. Re
pli -8 to tbe invitations he added bad al
ready been received from tbe Premiers of
Canada and other North American colo
nies, the Cape Colony and Natal, all of
which were extremely gratifying.
Purposing the discussion of the motion
introduced by Mr. Chamberlain yester
day, to which the Colonial Secretary spoke
to-day, Bir William Harcourt, the leader
of tbe opposition, reminded tbe House
t at tbe proposed inquiry was not only
for the Hov e of Commons, but for tbe
whole civilized world as well.
He then spoke in favor of the motion
and against the amendment offered yes
terday by M. J. McLean, which recited
that: "In view of the peaceful settlement
of the South African question and the
punishment of the Transvaal raiders it
would be inexpedient to reopen the mat
ter and needless toreappoint the commis
sion."
McLean then withdrew his amendment
and eventually a South African commis
sion was appointed.

THE COMING ELECTION.
Municipal Ownership and Local
Option Will Be the
Issues.
ALAMEDA, Cai,., Jan. 29.â The city
election will be held upon April 12 this
year, at which time two members ot the
Board of Trustees, two of the Board of
Education, and, if the amendment now
before the Legislature passes, a full Board
of Library Trustees will be elected, besides
a City Clerk, City Attorney, Treasurer
and ex-officio Tax Collector, Assessor,
Marshal and Recorder. As the nomina
tions must be certified to thirty days
before election, they will all be in by
March 13.
One of the main questions involved in
the campaign will be the new local option
law in precincts and not at large, as has
been tbe plan before. This will be worked
through the referendum ordinance, once
tried on the question of the special tax
for the free library building.
Municipal ownership of public utilities
will be another grave question. The
former is in tho handi of tne Anti-Saloon
Leaeue. while the latter will depend upon
the Non-Partisan convention for its back
ing, and as the most of the 700 members
of the Municipal Ownership League are
favorable to this convention it may read
ily be seen that it has strong backing. No
call for conventions have yet been issued.

Stanford 3len Refuse to Enter Aquatic
Contests With Berkeley Because of
Lack of Training Facilities.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 29.â Track Cap
tain Brown of the Berkeley team is in
receipt of a communication from Captain
Dole of Stanford in which the latter states
that on account of the lack of facilities of
the Palo Alto men for practice in aquatic
sports rowing as an intercollegiate con
test is out of the question. He says that
the Stanford men are five miles from any
sneet of water lari?e enough to row on,
and that even after getting to it they are
required to accommodate themselves to
the tides.
"We are anxious to race," said he, "but
with tne present difficulties in the way
I am afraid it is impossible."
This response practically settles the
long-di.-cussed question of establishing
rowing as a regular annual contest between
the two universities. Notwithstanding
their inability to get rowing on the list
the Berkeley men will tiain as usual at
their quarters on the Oakland estuary, in
preparation for contests with locai rowing
clubs.

â For four years I have been ailing with ner-

which greatly hindered me in my work as a

past seven years in San Francisco. I suffered
with x>ain and oppression of the chest and

ertion would feel weak and nervous. On
January 4, 1897, 1 applied

found that my heart and stomach were both
disordered. I was placed under treatment and

A
New man. The doctor applied electricity and
prescribed certain electric fluids for internal
use, also magnetic oil for external application.
These remedies combined have had a magical
effect, and now, on January 14, I can truthfully
say that my health is fully restored. I am
VERY THANKFUL FOR SUCH A RAPID

Bill Authorizing Appoint
ment of Five Monetary
Commissioners.
This May Lead to International
Conference on Coinage of
Silver and Gold.
Hear of Massachusetts Argued That
the M jirity of All People Favor
the Doable Standard.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 29.â The
Senate to-day by a vote of 40 to 12 agreed
to a motion made by Hale (R.) of Maine
that the adjournment to-day shall be un
til Monday next.
Bacon (D.) of Georgia introduced a joint
resolution declaring that the United
States deprecate war and desire fie main
tenance of peace and friendship with the
world and invitine all civilized nations to
make a corresponding and reciprocal
declaration. He asked that the joint res
olution be referred to the Committee on
Foreign Relations and it was so agreed.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska introduced a
-eaolution, which was laid over, declaring
that any judicial sale of the properties of
the Union Pacific without additional leg
islation by Congress would not be binding
on the United States, nor exclude it from
any legal or equitable right vow possessed
therein, if such sale were subsequently
ratified by Congressional action.
The Senate bill for a commission to an
international monetary conference was
brought up and Vilas (D.) of Wisconsm
delivered a prepared speech against it as
a vicious and misleading bill. Three
times, be said, the United States had
caused the "pretty piece" to be acted,
twice at Paris and once at Brussels. The
truth was, and the Senate mi :;ht as well
realize it, that that international farce no
longer pleased Americans. They could
all, or nearly all, be fooled a part of the
time, but the time for such foil; had
passed.
Stewart (P.) of Nevada said that he
could not refrain from tendering the Sen
ator from Wisconsin his sincere congratu
lations. The Senator had eloquently por
trayed what he (Stewart) had always
claimed to be an extreme folly. The
action of foreign powers to regulate do
mestic affairs had always seemed to him
preposterous.
Pet.igrew (silver R.) of South Dakota
said that he protested against the passage
of the bill. First, because this country
was capable of managing its own affairs
without the assistance of any otner na
tion, and second, because He did
not believe the United States should
any longer be suppliants at the
feet of the European nations, which are
the chief beneficiaries of the gold stand
ard, lie declared that he would have no
part in any effort for a further conference
after the humiliation submitted to in the
former conferences. He closed his
speech with a declaration that it was too
humiliating to have the United States
continue to be (in monetary affairs) the
laughingstock of Europe.
Alien (P.) oi Nebraska, while expressing
his confidence that the attempt at inter
national conference would be a contempti
ble failure, thougnt it would be a serious
mistake if the friends of monetary reform
should .obstruct the passage of the Dill in
the slightest degree. One of his friends
on the other side sent one of the most
brilliant of their number (Wolcott) to
Europe to hunt up somebody to confer
with, and no report had been received that
anybody in England or any where else was
willing to confer. He should not vote
for the bill, but he wanted to see it become
a law, although it was wrong.
Carter (R.) of Montana read a prepared
speech in support of the bill, which was,
he said, manifestly prepared to facilitate
euccesa in the movement for bimetallism.
It gave to the President all needed author
ity, unhampered by needless conditions.
He appealed to Cannon (R.) of Utah to
withdraw his amendment, as Stewart
(Pop.) of Nevada had withdrawn his. It
would then devolve on the administration
within the next four years to demonstrate
either its ability to have an international
conference held or that it had failed. The
administration vras entitled to the co
operation of those who would see silver
remonetized either by National or inter
national effort-
Cannon (R.) of Utah declined to with
draw his amendment and spoke in favor
of it.
Chandler asked and obtained unani
mous consent to have the vote taken on
the bill and amendments at 4 o'clock.
The Nicaragua bill having been laid be
fore the Senate Morgan (D.) of Alabama
asked unanimous consent to have the vote
taken at 4 p. m. Tuesday next. Morgan
fave notice that he would ask have the
ill taken up after the routine morning
business on Monday and to continue in
session until the final vote.
Hoar gave notice that alter the Nicar
agua canal bill was out of the way he
would press consideration of the bank
ruptcy bill.
The monetary conference bill was again
taken up, and Bacon (D.) of Georgia ad
vocated nis own amendment, giving spe
cific authority to the President to call a
conference.
Jones (D.) of Arkansas said that the
friends of the measure ought to have ab
solute control of it, and that he would not
vote for v single amendment that they did
not themselves accept, but he had little
faith in their faith.
Shoup (R.) of Idaho advocated the pass
age of the bill free from all amendments
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts combated
the idea that the possibility of an inter
national monetary arrangement was a
chimera or a dream. He thought that
the eentleman who expressed such an
idea failed to take into consideralion one
of two facts. There was no doubt what
ever that a large majority of the people of
the civilized world was in iavor of the
double standard of gold and silver. There
were a few people in this country like the
Senator from Wisconsin (Viias) who were
not in favor, but the Democratic party,
the Populists and the supporters of Bryan
believed in the double standard, and the
Republican party, so far as it could be
judged, had declared its belief in that
doctrine and had pledged itself to pro
mote it. Another exception to the doc
trine of international bimetallism was the
Benator (Stewart), who did wunt foreign
nations to enjoy bimetallism. That Sena
tor wanted to have money in this country
to poor, cheap and miserable that even a
Japanese or Chinaman would not touch it.
"I do not want it so dear," Stewart in
terposed, "that an American cannot get
Hoar continued at considerable length,
pving h.i experiences and observations
in the financial question in France and
England while he was in those countries
klast summer. "I consider it not at all pos
jlible that Germany under certain circum
ritnnces may join a bimetallic union, even
irithout England. The writer," continued
a . r> "g' v "es his or inion that Russia
would be ready for the same union wnen
jbe time comes, and he quotes a letter
ttom a Russian friend saving that if the
French Government plays its cards he is
sure Kussia will declare for bimetallism.
I do not wish to be understood as saying
thatthii consummation is at hand, but I
mean to say that the time has come for
another effort. It is a crowing opinion.
It will be stronger twelve months hence
than it is now, and it is stronger now than
it was r.velve mciitns ago."
Hoar'- speech attracted great attention
on the floor and in the galleries. It was
followed oy speeches either in advocacy
or in toleration of the measure by
Senators Gallin- er (R.) of New Harnp
'â¢liire, Blanchaid(D.) of Lousiana, White
(D.) of California, Allison (R.) of lowa
and Gorman (D.) of Maryland. r lhe
latter, relerrinz to the London square

four great cities throttle all the tree men

PANAMA CANAL SLAVERY.
White Laborers Driven Out by Negroes
Imported Under Contract â Starva
tion Wages Paid.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 29.â A dis
patch from Kingston, Jamaica, says: Con
siderable dissatisfaction 'exists among the
laborers on the Panama canal on account
of the recent importation of negro work- !
men under contract for three years at Â£2 j
a month, with an additional 10 shillings
and 10 pence for sub- head men and head- \
men. They are to work nine hours a day, |
to have full mea.s, medical attendance,
hospital care and maintenance and return
passage at the close of the term.
This arrangement, which is a liberal one
for the Africans, contrasts with the miser
able scale of pay established by the com
pany lor the local men, many of whom
are old canal men and inured to the hard- j
ships of isthmian life. For the ordinary !
laborer $1, Colombian currency, is the
standard rate; headmen and mechanics,
from $1 50 to $1 75; field clerks, from $2 to
$2 50; office clerks, from $2 50 to $3. The
premium on gold is $1 35.
Unsuccessful efforts have been made by
the men to force the company to raise
I their rates, and many are leaving for
Carthagena and Ecuador, where railroad I
work is going on. At attempt at a gen
eral strike on the work was easily over- |
come, owing to the overcrowded state of !
the labor market in the isthmus.
The news that the work on the canal |
had recommenced brought crowds of la- j
borers from all parts of the world, many
of whom are now in a state of semi-siarva- ;
tion.
The operations of the new company are I
at present confined to three sections, cov
ering a distance of seven miles. The work
is being done in a thorough and business
like manner, and the progress already
made is considerable. While the work j
has none of the gigantic proportions it
had under the De Lesseps management,
the business-lite economy exercised and
steady work promise more successful re
sults.
NO GENERAL LEGISLATION.
The Extra Session of Congress Will Be
lor the Specific Purpose of Pass
ing a Revenue Bill.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 29.â A Times
special from Washington says: Chairman
Dingley of the Ways and Means Commit
tee, outlining yesterday the programme
ol' the administration at the coming extra
session of Congress, said: "There will be
no general legislation during the extra
session. President McKinley will call
Congress in extraordinary session for the
specific purpose or passing a revenue bill.
When we meet in March the bill will be
ready to present to the House and it will
be passed within thirty days and sent to
the Senate. Nothing cisc will be done by
the House. We will adjourn from day to
day, or take three Hays' adjournments, ac
cording to the provision of the constitu
tion.
"The eyes of the country will be on the
Senate alone. The Hou^-e wiil not con
sider pension bills, nor enter into any
general legislation. We will simply re
main nominally in session until the Sen
ate readies a conclusion on the revenue
bill, and then the measure will go into a
conference, where it will be penected in a
manner to suit both houses of Congress.
I do not believe that the Senate will force
a long session when nothing is under con
sideration except the tariff bill."
The sugar trust lobby is on the ground,
headed by Searles, its legislative repre
sentative. The Ways and Means Com
mittee has eot down to the sugar schedule
in a provisional, preliminary way, and the
sugar interests appear promptly on tbe
scene.
Murdered by an Amoroii* Coachman.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 29.â Albert Cun
ning, a coachman, shot and instantly
killed Mrs. Mary Benning at her home on
State street this morning. He then at
tempted to shoot the woman's two boys,
and failing, fatally shot himself. He had
undue liking for Mrs. Benning, who did
not reciprocate and who had forced him
to leave her house.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1897.
RED-HOT TALK
IN THE HOUSE
Defeat of the Bill Relating
to the Atlantic and
Pacific.
Powers of Vermont Is Severely
Scored for His Peculiar
Railroad Record.
i Barrett Also Says Considerable About
Fraud and Watering Railway
Siocks.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 29.â 1n the
House to-day Powers (R.) of Vermont
called up the report oi the conferees on
the bill constituting a new corporation for
! the purchasers ol the Atlantic and Pacific
Railway and explained the purposes of
the agreement. Powers used the state
ment prepared by the conferees of the
first conclusions reached by them as a
basis of his remarks.
Terry (D.) of Arkansas said the report
sboula not be adopted, for the reason
that it did not suffici-ntly protect tne
creditors of the old corporation.
Lacey (R.) of lowa condemned the re
port, sayine it yielded every point made
by the House amendments. The adop
tion of the report was advocated by Harri
son (D.) of Alabama, one of the conferees.
Powers raised the previous question on
the adoption of the report. Tuis was an
j tagonized by Barrett and the motion
i failed.
Barrett then got the floor. He said that
no railroad had ever been built whose his
tory was so black with fraud and dishonor
as the Atlantic and Pacific. The confer
ees' report would enable the managers in
the proposed ieorgnnization to continue
the policy ot that history in the future;
$16,000,000 of first mortgage bonds of the
Atlantic and Pacific have already been
placed by the reorganization committee
with the Atcaison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad Company for the payment of
$10,600,000. That company was already
practically the owner of the Atlantic and
Pacific, and by the report the directors of
that corporation, who had cheated the
constituents of the Government out of
millions of dollars, are to be authorized to
issue $59,000,000 stock on a property that
cost them but $10,600,000. How can the legis
lative committee consistently provide pun
ishment for men who indulge in these
schemes for defrauding their fellow-citi
zens when it approves legislation enabling
such stock-watering transactions as this?
Cook (R.) of Illinois spoke against the
adoption of the report, as did alsoÃae(D.)
of Arkansas. Grout (R.) of Vermont ana
Blue (R.) of Kansas favored it.
Flyun (R.) of Oklahoma said he felt the
necessity of Congress granting a Federal
charter 10 the corporation in order that it
might opera.c the road through his terri
tory. The people living along the line of
the railroad were not responsible for the
immense capitalization of which the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Barrett)
complained. That was done by residents
of Massachusetts, who had sold the stock
to servant-girls of New England, who were
bankrupted by the management of these
gentlemen.
Grout (R.) of Vermont, referring to Bar
rett's statenient'that the road had been
practically sold for $10,000,000 to the Santa
Fe, said that the acuon involved only one
division of the road, not the entire line.
The argument for tne adoption of the
report was closed by Powers. Barrett
also responding to Judge Powers denied
having any interest in the till except
which arose from his connection with leg
islation while a member of the Massa
chusetts court, which made the proposi
tions contained in thÂ« report illegal and
in his opinion subjected them to suspicion
everywhere.
Referring to Powers' remaiks concern
ing himseii Barrett reviewed that gentle
man's career as chairman of the Commit
tee on Pacific Railroads since he (Barrett)
had been a member of the House.
"In that time,' said he, "no proposi
tion however idangerous to tlie Nation
nor how advantageous to the corporations
had failed to receive his support."
In support he cited the decision on the
Pacific railroad funding bill.
Replying to the assertion by Judge
Powers that railroad wreckint* had been
practiced by the people of Boston and
I vicinity, Barrett repelled the charges, say
ing that iv no State of the Union were tne
; rights of property so well and thoroughly
i respected as in Massachusetts.
'â¢The gentleman," be continued, "comes
here with the record and reputation of a
long period of service on the Supreme
Court of that State. Talk of railroad
wrecking! Where can anything in that
line be found equal to the history of the
Central Railroad of Vermont after a series
of receiverships conuuettd by the Su
preme Court? Ask any honest man of
that State who invested his money in the
securities of that corporation and wai
robbed of it by the decisions of that tri
bunal, which have not met the approval
of any respectable court iv any other jur
isdiction."
Grout (R.) of Vermont suggested that it
was not desirable to renew the war of the
States here.
Barrett â I inaugurated no war. It was
begun by the gentleman's colleague.
[Cries of "Goon, Barrett."!
Barrett said he imputed no dishonor
able motives to the legislators of Vermont,
i but he did not forget that that body was
| the creation of the people and that the in
fluence of the railroad corporations was
the most potent and powerful that found
expression. The record of that railroad
j receivership and of the court, he con
i tinued, was such as to cause the sons of
the Green Mountain State to blush for it.
The report of the committee was re
jectedâ7l to 143.
The House voted to insist upon its
amendments to the bill and also to insist
upon the insertion of a provision giving
further protection to the creditors of the
old corporation, especially those holding
claims for labor and materials.
Tbe agriculture bill was then taken up
and Hardy (R.) of Indiana, under the hve
ininute rule, began reading a speech in
favor of the acquisition of Cuba by the
United States. At the end of five minutes
tbe chairman's gavel fell, whereupon Tal
bert (D.) of South Carolina suggested that
the gentleman be allowed "to proceed a
few minutes longer before he Bays any
thing." [Laughter.]
W. A. Stone (R.) of Pennsylvania asked
unanimous consent for Hardy to proceed.
Howe (R.) of New York objected, "We
are here to discuss the agriculture appro
priation bill, and I object to this waste of
tim-."
"Then, Mr. Chairman," said Hardy,
pounding the desk, his face reddenmc, "I
give notice that no bill goes through the
House by unanimous consent for the rest
of this session."
While the next paragraph was being
read various members who were con
cerned over the probable effects of ihe en
forcement of Hardy's declaration pointed
out the way by which he could get an op
portunity to continue his remarks.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
paragraph the gentleman from Indiana
was on bis feet, and his cry of "Mr. Chair
man!" gave him instant recognition to
move to "strike out the last word" and
proceeded with his speech.-
The committee rose without concluding
consideration of the bill and took a recess
until 8 p. M.
MAD MASTIFF RUNS AMUCK.
Many Persons Lacerated in the Streets of
Wheeling, W. Va., Whose Citizens
Are Terror- Stricken.
NEW YORK. H. V., Jan. 29.â A Herald
special from Wheeling, W. Va. says: This
city has been in a state of terror for twen
ty-four hours on account of a masiiff
which has been running amuck, afflicted
with rabies, biting and snapping at all
who came in bis way.
The animal tirst appeared about Tues
day or Wednesday night in the Second
Ward, where his actions aroused great
alarm and caused the authorities to send
in an alarm to all policemen.
The dog was a powerful beast, and
when he attacked Margaret Schell, an 11
--year-old girl, she was completely at his
mercy. He chewed her forehead and
cheek, making * wound from which the
blood flowed freely. A policeman tried to
kill the beast but could not gst a shot be
cause of the crowds.
Tiie dog was next heard of half a mile
away, where he attached Richard Kenney,
biting him through the nose. He next
attacked Victor Bauer, a mail- wagon
driver, lacerating bisneck and face badiy .
Bauer was alone, and though quite a
strong man he could do little against the
brute. '
Harry Freeze, a 16-year-old boy, was
attacked soon after daylight near the Fifth
Ward market and was bitten through the
arm.
John Speidell met the doe in the Fifth
Ward a little later and escaped into a
house, but not until he had been badly
scratched on the hand by tbe dog's teeth.
Â±Jy this time the police had been massed
from all parts of the city and were hunting
the dog.
Charles Zimmerman was the first to en
counter him. He tried to shoot the dog,
but it sprang at him and, as he fired, took
tbe revolver and nearly the wnole of the
policeman's right hand into his mouth.
His sharp teeth cut through the flesh,
making a ragged wound in the hand. Four
more bullets ended the dog's life.
The police have been busy all day.V.illing
dogs which it was supDosod had been bit
ten by the dog. Several people other than
those named were bitten or received
scratches from t;>e mad dog, and four or
five had their clothing torn, two men
having their coats stripped from their
backs.
A movement has been started to send
the dog's victims to New York for treat
ment.
MET A SHOCKING DEATH.
An Ironworker Burned to a Crisp While
Making Repairs to the Boilers
of a Steamship.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 29.â John
Connors, 50 years old, met a shocking
death yesterday on the steamship Eastern
Prince of the Knott line, lying at the East
Central Pier at Atlantic dock, Brooklyn.
The vessel arrived last Tuesday from
Brazil with her boilers strained from the
effects of the storm. Connors was in the
employ of the Mott Iron Works, in South
Brooklyn, and was sent yesterday with
several other employes to make necessary
repairs to the interior of one of the
boilers.
Belore beginning operations the men
lowered into the boiler a charcoal furnace,
with which the iron work was to be
heated. Connors climbed through the
ruannole, the only means by which an en
trance to the boiler conld be gained, and
was lowered to the bottom at 11 o'clock.
When the factory whistle announced the
noon hour one of the workmen climbed to
the top of the boiler and shouted to Con
nors. There was no reply.
A workman was lowered Into the boiler
and Connors was found lying dead across
tue furnace. The rescuer dragged him
from the furnace and beat out the flames.
Then the boiler was so full of charcoal
fumes that lie had to seek the open air.
The upper part of the man's body was
burned U> a crisp.
He had evidently been overcome by the
fumes and had lallen on the furnace. The
task of removing the body from the boiler
was difficult. A derrick was rigged and
the men worked two hours before the body
was finally rescued.
Several were partly overcome by the
fumes of charcoal and had to be lifted
from the boiler.

quantity of gold mining stock on which
ne wanted to raise some money.

said the bank was willing to take the
bonds if they were all right and requested
that they be lett at the bank to be verified.
They are bonds of a well-known mining
stocit company of Denver and listed up
high in the Colorado Mining Exchange.
Communication with the company in
Denver brought the response that the
bonds were worthless, as the numbers
had been raised and me signatures forged.

DIES IN SEARCH
OF A QUARREL
Notorious Percy Douglas
of Bakersfiald Shot
to Death.
Breaks Into Fire Chief Willows'
Room and Is Stopped by
Buckshot.
Abrupt Ending cf the Career of a
Man Who Reveled in
Crime.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Jan. 29.â Ed
Wiliows shot and tilled the notorious
Percy Douclas shortly after 7 o'clock this
evening. The shooting took place at Wil
lows' room over the athletic building on
X street. Douglas had been on a spree
for three weeks past, and during this time
displayed an unusually utly temper, ter
rorizing with "gun plays" every one he
imagined he had a spite against. Some
time ago he threatened Willows' life, be
cause Willows assisted in jailing him some
time ago, and he- threatened the lives of
several officers.
Douglas was in the Palm Garden saloon,
a block from where the killing occurred,
and while there became troublesome. He
left the saloon, and, it is supposed, walked
directiy to Willows' room. On arriving
there he knocked at the door ana called
for Wihows, who answered him by advis
ing him to go away, saying he did not
want to have trouble. Douglas proceeded
to kick the door in. As soon as hÂ« bad
forced it open he received a charge of
buckshot from a sawed-off shotgun in
Willows' hands. The charge took effect
in the neighborhood of the heart. Doug
las staggered back several feet along the
ball and fell forward on bis face, dying
instantly.
W T illows left the place and surrendered
himself to the officers. Coroner Helm
was called. When he arrived he found
the body lying on its face in a pool of
blood. The dead man's pistol was out of
its holster, lying under the body on the
floor, and his right hand was resting on it,
showing conclusively that he went to Wil
lows' room intent on a fight. Douglas
never went without the weapon.
Douglas' tragic end occasions no sur
prise. For years it has been prophesied
that he would "die with Ins boots on."
Off and on since the early eighties he has
been a terror to this community. In 1886
lie deliberately killed a Mexican on Nine
teenth street. For this crime tie served
two years in San Quentin. bhortly after
leaving prison he shot a brakernan in
Fresno County, and for this he got eight
years in Folsom. Atter serving three years
of the term lie was pardoned by Governor
Markham. For awhile afterward He was
quite peac^lul, then he resumed his des
perate career. When sober he acted as a
gentleman. He was a miner by occupa
tion, hut of late conducted the City Brew
ery.
Edward Willows, who fired the fatal
shot, is the Chief of t'.:e Fire Department,
and a man of grit and nerve.
"Some one had to do it," he said. "I
am sorry it was I."
TUOLUMNE COUNTY ROBBED.
Figures on a Warrant in the Treasurer's
Office " Raised " by a Clever
Penman.
SONORA, Cal., Jan. 29.â Sonora's busi
ness men were somewhat startled to-day
by a story in the Union Democrat to the
effect that a warrant had been raised in
the County Treasurer's office, and that al
ready several depositors had withdrawn
their accounts, the treasury being located
in a local bank. The article as printed in
tne Democrat was, in part, as follows:
The Board of Supervisors, in making out Its
semi-annual report last week, detected a war
rant that had been raised from $2 to $12. It
was drawn on. a claim presented by Oscar
I Crabtree for labor performed oa the road iv
district 5. That gentlemen was summoned
before the board and questioned by the mem
bers. It was c.ear, however, from the start
that the handy man with the pen must have
been located in the Treasurer's office. ' The
warrant was numbered 1306, and was issued
on December 1 by Clerk Ortega for $2, as
shown by the stub In the warrant-boot kept
! by him. It was cashed by Mr. Crabtree, he
i beiug paid by Treasurer Wells, who entered
i the warrant iv the warrant register. It was
after this that the crooked work was done,
and that by somebody having free access to
I the warrant-oook In the Treasurer's posses
sion. A figure "1" was iusened before the 'â¢2"
I in the blank space for the amount on the up
| per left-hand corner.
An examination of the warrant register re-
I vealed the fact that that book had been tam
pered with and that tne $2 paid to Crabtree
was made to correspond with the raised war
rant by inserting a "1" before the "2." The
page of the register where this warrant was
entered was filled out by Mr. Wells. When
questioned by the Supervisors ne was quite
positive that it was entirely correct, but wnen
! the item was shown to him he promptly de
clared that another hand than his had made
the figure. He informed tue board that he
woula repay the $10 and investigate the mat
ter further for his own protection.
Besides Mr. and Mrs. Wells the bank has no
attaches but a young man named Edward
Burden, who is said to have lived a last life.
The Supervisors have placed the matter in the
District, Attorney's hands for further investi
gation.
The flurry in business circle?" has not
been caused by the loss of $10 to the
county, but by the fear that an investiga
tion will show much larger operations.
SAN /HA TEG'S GRAND JURY.
Charges of Partiality Against the Board
of Education Found to Have Been
Unwarranted.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Jan. 29.â The
Grand Jury has riled its report with the
County Clerk. It includes that of Expert
William S. Jack, who was appointed to
examine the books of the county official*,
and Expert G. W. Beattie, appointed to
investigate the controversy which has
arisen over the marking of the examina
tion papers by the Board of Education.
It is quite voluminous, comprising 150
pages of type-written matter.
Tne report recommends that the statute
compelling the recording of births, mar
riages and deaths should be strictly en
forced. It urges greater strictness in the
issuance of burial permits. In view of the
promiscuous slaughter of game in and out
of season it recommends the appointment
of a fish and game warden. It indorses
the report of G. W. Beat tie, special expert
in the school controversy, whose report
shows that there is not the slightest evi
dence in the papers examined by the
County Board of Education proving that
the board was willinc to do injustice to
any pupil, and though there are some dis
crepancies and irregularities in the mark
ings yet they are frequently in favor of
KeUwood City pupils. Notning was found
which would indicate a eenerai disDoai
tion to favor the pupils of one town rather
than those of anotuer.
GENTLE RAIN IN THE SOUTH.
Ranchers and Orchardists Jubilant Over
the Excellent Outlook for
Abundant Crops.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 29.â A een
tle rain fell over most of Southern Cali
fornia this forenoon to the gratification of
ranchers and orchardists. The precipita
tion last night and this forenoon reached
nearly an inch, making nine inches for
the season, against five last year. This
seems to be the year for the agriculturist
to dp joyfui. Whenever he wants a littie
rain it comes. So fur it has been a great
year for crops, and the outlook for an
abundant yield never looked brighter.
There was no particular need of rain at
this juncture, but it has come just the
same, and it is welcome.
Reports from the country are to the
effect that grain is growing rapidly and
is far advanced for this season of the year.
Tne orchards and gardens are also look
ing in excellent condition.
The rain to-day was of the drizzle order,
although for a few moments, between 11
and 12 o'clock, it came down in a lively
fashion, bringing out umbrellas, filling
the cutters with water, and keeping cus
tomers in the stores.

GOVERNOR SADLER
SIGNS THE BILL
Prize-Fighters Welcomed
to the Sagebrush
State.
Rival Cities Already Striving
for the Corbett-Fitz3immons
Contest.
Th 3 Executive Declares Pugilism
N.t Half as Brutal es
Football.
CARSON, Nev.. Jan. 29.â The prize-fight
bill was signed by Governor Sadler at 2:02
o'clock to-day and the news was on the
wire two mmutes later. The promoters
of the scheme had arranged a signal by
â which they could communicate with a
man in front of the telegraph office.
After the pen which signed the bill was
laid aside the agent of an Eastern paper
was on deck wits a camera to take a
photoeraph of the Dill as it came from the
Enrolling Committee. He was not al
lowed to do so, however. Governor
Sadler, when asked his reasons lor sign
ing the bill, said:
"It was passed by a decisive majority in
both houses. I received teieerams and
letters from all over the State for and
against the bill and the petitions, letters
and dispatches stood about 18 to 1 in favor
of rhe bill." Public sentiment is for it and
I believe it wiil bring not only a great
deal of money to the State, but it will
bring moneyed men here who will be able
to personall> investigate our resources.
The licenseâ $1000 â is high enough to
Bhut out everything but the big affairs,
and the big affairs will because of the
high price of admission bring only the
better ciass of sports.
"Glove contests are taking place nearly
every day in the leading cities of the
Union. Men in all the walks of life attend
them and they must enjoy them or they
would not pay to go. The East cannot
hold ud its hands and call us 'wild and
woolly,' for New York, and even the
Quaker City have them. Glove contests
are not half as brutal as football."
"What if they had attempted to pull the
fight off without passing the bill?"
;> I should have enforced the old law, no
matter what it cost the State to do so."
"Would you have called out the
troops?"
â¢'I would if occasion called for such a
course."
"Will you protect persons who promote
fistic encounters in Nevada, should they
comply with the law?''
"\'es. They will receive whatever offi
cial protection it is in my power to
grant." â¢
WBAT HE.\O CAS OFFER.
Residents Believe Their Town Will Get
the Big Content.
RENO, Nevada, Jan. 29.â Prize-fight
talk still occupies the almost undivided
attention of Reno residents, and now that
Governor Sadler has signed the bill legal
izing contests in Nevada every resident of
Reno is on the alert to prove that his
town should be selected as the location of
the battle-ground. Inquiries from several
quarters as to how many persons could be
accommodated in Reno were received
here to-day. The answers sent to all were
that at least 2500 or 3000 strangers couid
be easily housed, and under a pinch
double this number could be accommo
dated.
Everything indicates that Reno will be
chosen for the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight.
It is on a main-line railroad, has the
largest population of any town in the
State, has tbe only telegraph facilities for
handling the long accounts for the press,
and has old prison wails, which with lit
tle expense couid be made to accommo
date thousands of people.

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 29.â James J. Cor
bett, who is to fight Fitzsimmons in Ne
vada on March 17, said to-night to a
reporter for the United Associated
Presses:
"I shall close my theatrical engage
ments at Kansas City a week from to-mor
row. Then I will make arrangements so
that I can get a full six weeks of prepara
tion for tbe mil). 1 intend to send a man
ahead of me to mate ail arrangements for
training quarters. I may train in Denver
or some other place at high altitude, and
I don't know whether I shall go to Ne
vada much ahead of the day fixed for the
fight.
"I have received no notification from
Stuart as to the location of the ring and I
don't care where it is. I suppose Stuart
is waiting until he has the exact place de
cided upon. I don't need more than a
month's training and I can pacs up my
apparatus at an hour's notice and go to
wherever tbe place is to be. I have no
â¢tip' from Stuart as to wnere the right will
take place.
"The signing of the bill by the Governor
of Nevada was unknown to me, but I pre
sume that it means that the fight will be
brought off in that State."

meeting of the New Charter Club was h^ld
last evening:. It was reported that 6000

THESE TO TALK
FOR STANFORD
Members of the Intercol
legiate Debating Team
Selected.
Miss Stebbins One of the Trio
to Contest With Berkeley
Orators.
Juniors Morgan and Switzsr Are
â¢ Award3d the Other Two
Positions.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
29.â 1n spite of the inclement weatner, a
good-sized audience attended tise last of
the preliminary debates held in the chapel
this evening. The subject of the debate
was: "Resolved, that a system of muni
cipal government concentrating all execu
tive and administrative power in the
Mayor should be adopted in San Fran
cisco."
At the close of the debate the judges
withdrew to hold a private consultation
before delivering their decision. Profes
sors Brun, Barnes and Ross acted as
judges ana Dr. Abbott presided. As the
result to their deliberations J. M. Switzer,
A. M. Morgan aud Miss L. L. Stebbins
were chosen to represent Stanford at its
debate with Berkeley.
The attention of the audience was held
closely during the evening's discussion,
and the remarks of the speakers received
merited applause. The affirmative was
represented by J. W. Bell '97, C. E.
Schwartz '99 and F. D. Hunt '00.
The negative side of the question was
presented by B. M. Palmer, '97; R. J.
O'Neil, '97; C. N. Riggins, '98, and J. M.
Switzer, '98. The affirmative orators
brought out the point that the functions
of government should not be divided to se
cure the best results in municipal affairs.
The Federal system was advocated as a
means of bringing about the desired re
iultÃ. The responsibility could be fixed
and greater interest would be taken in
local elections. This was calculated to do
away with existing evils.
The negative maintained that "one man
power" was not a democratic form of cov
ernment; that three heads or thirty
heads were better than one in the admin
istration of city affairs.
Tney advocated the introduction of civil
eervice regulations to get competent of
ficials, and they pointed out the fact that
a Mayor with all the power would be in
fluenced Dy bad as well as good men.
A. B. Morgan '98. of the successful trio,
came to the front as an effective speaker
last semester while president of the
Bryan Silver Club.
He spoke in San Francisco and else
where during the Campaign and pained a
reputation Â£3 a clear, comprehensive
orator.
He represented the Philolexians Da
bating Society in the preliminary debates
and was at one time president of that
organization. He comes from Spanish
Fork, Utah, and is taking a course in law
at the university.
J. M Switzer '98 represented the stu
dent body in t lie preliminary debates.
He, too, won distinction as an orator of
no little ability during the Presidential
campaign.
As president of the Stanford McKinley
Club he acquired considerable experience
in public speaking. He has an easy deliv
ery and makes a forcible argument.
He la the newiy elected manager of the
Varsity football team. Switzer also served
as business manager of the Sequoia, one
of the college publications, and made a
good record.
He hails from Peru, Indiana, and is
taking history for his major study.
Miss Londa L. Stebbins surprised the
audience during the first preliminary de
bate by making the most convincing talk
of the evening.
Tbe excellent impression she made at
that time led to her selection this evening
as one of the debating trio.
She was chosen by the Saturday Night
Club to contest in the preliminary
debates.
This is the debating club organized and
conducted by the women students who
take a lively interest In the questions of
tne day.
She is a ready and fluent speaker, and
her selection by the judges meets with
marked approval. Miss Stebbins is taking
a course in hygiene.
FUMES CHECK
A BANDIT RAID
I Continued from Firit Page.\
the "through" safe which was in tbe
express-car fired by the robbers. The safe
doors are badly warped by beat, and is is
doubtful if the contents will ba worth
anything should, they be reached. The
two small "way" safes were completely
wrecked by dynamite. Speaking to-night
of the company's loss, Mr. Shelby said:
"It is impossible at this time to esti
mate our exact loss. It all depends upon
the condition of the contents of the
through safe. According to Messenger
Butler's statement there was very little of
value in the small safes. Our loss will in
all probability amount to very little
should the matter contained in the large
sale not be injured. Until we are able to
breaK into this 1 can give no estimate."
Richard Koesler, manager of the
Southern Pacific lines in Oregon, is of the
opinion that the robbers cannot escape
capture. Tne reward of $1000 for their
apprehension, he thinks, will prove a
sufficient incentive to insure the arrest of
the bandits. His advices to-night state
that every inch of ground in the vicinity
of the spot where the hold-up occurred is
being carefully patrolled by experienced
trailer--, and steps are being taken by State
and county officials to begin a man hunt
on a prodigious scale.
Portland City authorities claim that
they have excellent reasons for believing
that the robbery was planned in this place
and that the outlaws are well-known Port
land crooks. They decline to mention any
names, however, or give out *uch informa
tion as they assert to be in their posses
sion. It is sad on good authority that lo
cal officers have recently been shadowing
two men who are suspected of haying
been concerned in more than one train
robbery, and that~"lhe suspects eluded
their followers and disappeared from the
city about twelve hours before the Rose
burg hold-up occurred. Both crooks are
well known and are being searched for
high and low without success.
One Eastern drummer whose sanirles
were burned in the" baggage-car claims

are made by different persons, but rail
road officials place little reliance in them.

Congrtatlonal Itlll to Punish Train
Robbers With Dentil.
W. G. Curtis, engineer of maintenance
of right of way of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, called attention* to
the fact, yesterday afternoon, that ; the
United States was the on.y Government
in the world that permitted train rob
beries. â¢ -
"In Mexico," he said, "which is said to
be a half-civilized country, they put sol
diers on the trains when necessary, and
the National Government assumes the
responsibility of the pursuit, capture and
conviciiou of robbers, and tue prevention
of train robbing. Imazine train robberies
in England, Germany, France or Russia!
How many have you ever heard of taking
place in those countries? The Govern
ment does not permit such crimes."
Congressman Hubbard of Missouri has
recent]y introduced in the House of Rep
resentatives a bill to impose the death
penalty for the crime of train robbery. In
support of the bill he showed that during
the last six years there has been in this
country 183 stoppages of trains for crimi
nal purposes, as a result of which seventy
three persons were killed and fifty-eight
wounded by shots.. Last year alone there
were twenty-three hold-ups in which
thirty-two passengers and train men were
killed and many persona injured.
In regard to the bill Mr. Curtis said:
"I do not approve of capital punishment
for train robbery. That would make it
harder to secure a conviction. Imprison
ment for life would, in my judgment, be
better."
Following is the record by years of
railroad hold-ups:
1890 12
1891 16
1892 16
1893 33
1894 34
1895 49
1896 23
The James and Younger gang made the
United States historic by their bold and
outrageous attacks upon the public high
ways, and since their work was stopped
there has been no cessation of bold and
daring "holp-ups." Lass than a month
ago a train was "held up" almost wiihin
the city of St. Loirs. Within a mile of
the principal depot in Cincinnati there
was a "hold-up," and the engineer and
fireman lost their lives. The land pirates
derailed a train in Alabama only a few
weeks ago and many lives were destroyed.
The people of Clevaland distinctly remem
ber the robbery of the Lake Shore and
Michigan Southern Railroad train at
Kendallvilie, Ind.
Where people dwell in the proverbial
lamb-and-lionlike peace an armored arse
nal almost seems unnecessary to protect
the valuables entrusted to an express com
pany. Yet a load of deadly projectiles
pass through Cleveland, Ohio, daily. It
runs between St. Louis and New York,
both ways.
The arsenal cars were built by order of
the American Express Company. A bul
iet-proof room is located in the center of
the arsenal. These rooms are built of
steel one and one-half inches in thickness.
The steel doors leading to either end of
the car each have a small "peep-hole,"
through which a gun can be ranged and
fired. On either tide is a steel projection
a foot wide and extending Hrora the level
of the window-sill to the roof. At each
end and at the side of this arrangement
a porthole is provided, so that a rifle may
be used to sweep the side of the train,
front or rear, or to shoot from the side
hole in any direction from the bomb
proof. Through apertures, where seats
for two men are provided, the top of the
train is brought into range. The side
windows provide a clear view of what is
going on across the right of way. On
racks built in the bombproof-room are
six riot guns, each holding six cartridges,
each of which is filled with twelve heavy
buckshot.
In a case in the armored room is a
small caisson' in which is carefully
packed ammunition sufficient for a small
army, not to say anything of the Hotch
kiss rapid-firing gun and a line of
projectiles calculated to leave, when
properly handled, little more than the
hair of a bandit.
When the train to which the arsenal is
attached begins to slacken in speed two
men armed with riot guns disappear. It
is their duty to traverse the whole length
of the train to keep the American nomad
off. They keep a sharp lookout over all
portions of the train until it is under good
speed. The warlike appearance does not
end with the express-car. There is no
diminution of the warlike aspect on the
locomotive.
The engine of course |a a favorable
place for the bandits to commence opera
tions. Buckled to both the fireman and
engineer are "shooting arms" of the most
impioved pattern, while in the cab are two
men armed with riot guns and always
ready to shoot anything from a real robber
to an owl. Four guards are stationed in
the arsenal car, and they are armed with
six-shot 48-caliber self-cocking revolvers.
Each man's belt carries fifty extra cart
ridges.
One of the two safes aboard the arsenal
car is only opened at the more important
points along thVjine. The other is marked
local and is opened at certain places along
the route, none of the cities being unim
portant. The dials are removed from the
safes wnen they start and station agents
are eauipped with extra dials. These they
must carry to the car before a safe can be
opened.
The inside bolts are first unfastened by
the station spent, but he cannot gain
access without the assistance of the mes
senger, whose duty it is to unlock a huge
padlock. During a stop the express-car is
watched with eagle eyes by armed men.
One of the greatt-it difficulties is keeping
tramps off the car?. "Hoboes" are not
permitted to rids for a minute after they
are discovered, and many a brief engage
ment has taken place between the train
men and these wanderers.
The train force can be added to at sev
eral points.
On the day express-cars small fire and
burglarproof safes arc carried. J. P.
Gager, general agent of the American Ex
press Company, says these safes have
never been entered. Of course, if ;he
highwaymen were iven sufficient time
they could open them, but it would be a
long and difficult task.

"The. robbersâ there were two of them â
climbed over the tender from the blind
baggage in the usual manner and covered
the engineer and fireman with revolvers.
The fireman, whose name I ao not know,
managed to drop off, and he went to Rose
burg and gave the alarm. The robbers
mads the engineer â the engineer's name
is Morris â co back with them and cut off
the tmggaee-car, and they then forced the
engineer to run the car some distance
atiead. The robbers demanded admit
tance to the express-car, but the messen
ger refused io let tbem in. When they
threatened to blow open the car ne capitu
lated. They blew open two small safes.
Ido not know what the contents were.
The robbers did not get into the big safe
in the car. After they had rih"e<i the car
and took whatever of Value they could the
robbers set fire to the car and burned it
and its contents. The hold-up will not
aelay trains.
"Is that the extent of the damage?"
"Isn't that damage enough?" replitd
the general manager.
TURNER NAMED AT OLYMPIA.
The Spokane Man io Succeed Squire in
the United States Senate
at Washington.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 29.â George F.
Turner of Spokane was elected United
States Senator on the twenty -fifth ballet
by a vote of 68. Smith Douglas, who
nominated Turner, was the man to cast
the fifty-seventh voteâ the one which
elected him.
The Spokane people are wild with joy.
The vote for the others was: Denny 25,
Wescott 14, Squire 1. Westcott is the
Populist middle-of-the-road man.
A big sensation is likely to follow the
election ol Turner. Charges of gross cor
ruption are made. The committee ap
pointed to investigate them has subpe
naed all the Squire and Turner followers
anu will probe the affair to the bottom.
it met to-night but brought out no defi
nite information, though witnesses swore
that money was used to corrupt legisla
tors. Tobiassen and Conine, Populist
members, say that they will to-mor
row testify that tney were approached by
one candidate and offered money to vote.
They did not give tne name of the can
didate to-night, but will to-morrow. The
Squire men attempted to leave the City
on the evening train, but were prevented
by subpenas from the investigation com
mittee.
The Senate committee appointed to in
vestigate the charges against Senator
Plummer, of offering to sell his vote, find
them not substantiated. Dr. Calhoun,
who made the charges, refused to put
them in writing. This is regarded as a
Squire scheme to prevent Plummer for
voting for Turner to-day.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 29.â The Sen
atorial deadlock in this State is unbroten.
Three ballots were taken in the Legisla
ture to-day, all substantially alike, as fol
lows:
Thatcher 19, Rawlins (D.) 15, Hender
son (D.) 15, Mrs. S. E. Anderson (D.) 5, A.
C. .Bishop (R.) 3, F. 8. Harris (D.) 2,
Chambers and Powers (D.) 1 each.
There is a strong movement in favor of
A. W. McCune as a compromise candidate
and it is said his name will be brought be
fore the Legislature on Monday.
He has been quietly working for recog
nition for ten days or more. Neither of
the three leading candidates can now be
elected, it is thought, and Mr. McCune or
some other outsider's chances are good.
FLED FROM SAN JOSE.
Mrs. Herman Bruendel Elopes for the
Second Time With a San Fran
cisco Camb.er.
PORTLAND, Ob., Jan. 29.â 1n Septem
ber last Herman Bruendei, a retired
middle-aged saloon-keeper, living near
San Jose, Cal., came to Portland in search
of his young wife. The coupla had been
wedded about one year only. He was 50
years old she but 17.
It was a money ruetch, but all the wealth
the old man showered upon his youthful
wife failed to win her affections. She un
fortunately fell iv love with Harry
Bernard, a young San Francisco gam Dler,
who frequently visited San Jose.
The result of these visits was that in the
latter part of August Bernard and Mrs.
Bruendel eloped, coming to Portland and
bringing a considerable sum of the old
man's money with them.
Three weeks later Bruendel came to
Portland and succeeded in locating his
wife.
The young woman not only expressed
great contrition for her â desertion of her
husband, but she was prepared to return
1 home with him. She persuaded him,
however, to give Bernard $1000 in coin so
as to avoid a scandal.
Bruendel was again seen here to-day,
having come from Seattle, almost "broken
up," with another tale of domestic woe.
All went well at his home, he says, until
the early part of this month, when Ber
nard again came to Ban Jose.
After Bernard bad had .-everal inter
views with Mrs. Bruendel she at last con
fessed to having more affection for the
young gambler than for the old hus
band who was lavishing his wealth upon
her. She again deserted him on the 13th
inst., accompanied by the same character
less fellow.
On this occasion they went to Seattle,
leaving a note for Bruendel to that effect.
Again Bruendel followed his faithless
wife, and upon meeting her she refused to
recognize him.

JUMBLED WORDS
TELL OF INSSNITY
Disconnected Letter Lsft by
Nathan Dimick for
His Wife.
Believin? Did Not Love
Him, H? Had Resolved to
End His Career.
Sauta Cruz's Coroner Unable to Locate
the Money Possessed by the
Suicido.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 29.â The Dim
ick tragedy is etill the chief subject dis
cussed here. That Dimick set fire to his
dwelling seems to admit of no dispute.
That he tooK his own life seems evident
from the letter found by J& J. Boulter
yesterday, which is generally accepted as
genuine.
But there is a suspicion in the minds of
many that Dimick did cot intend to cut
short his existence in the manner in which
the end came.
It was suggested early in the Coroner's
investigation that it would be well to de
termine by autopsy whether or not Dim
ick had taken poison, but this was not
done.
The position in which the body was
found indicated that he was trying to
escape when overcome, and the fact that
he told his wife before her departure that
he -would lie down and rest is taken to in
dicate an intention to take poison after
having fired the house.
He had expressed a desire that his body
should be cremated, and it' is thought he
planned to accomplish this after tue drug
had rendered him unconscious.
The letter, which was discovered in a
nlace where it would presumably have
been safe had the house been destroyed,
was as follows :
Dear Hattie: I do love you yet, but cannot
endure the long-contluued silence with you.
You do not love me, by your actions. Will
you forsftve me wnen I am asleep? So good
by. Ido this myself in my right mind to set
rid of trouble. N. B. Dimick.
The letter was written in a firm hand,
but the writer's hand seems to have been
less bteady wnen he addressed the en
velope, which bore the following super
scription: "Mrs. H. S. Dimick, Perm.
aye.,93."
This letter was admitted as evidence
and indentified by witnesses before the
Coroner's Jury. When compared with
other letters written by Dimick, it was
found to be less clear in expression and
firm in penmanship, but there was no
doubt as to its genuineness.
After a larue number of witnesses had
been examined the jury rendered a ver
dict that Dimick came to his death by
suicide while temporarily insane.
The disposition Â«f more than $2500 in
gold, which was withdrawn by Dimick
from the City Bank and the Santa Cruz
Bank of Savings and Loans on December
26. 1896, is a mystery.
It had been thought this might be ex
plained before the Coroner, out the wit
nesses all disclaimed any knowledge as to
what bud been done with tbe money.
Mrs. DimicK did not know that her hus
band bad drawn the money. She testi
fied that their relations had been pleasant,
but Dimick was not satined to remain in
Santa Cruz, while.Bhe thought they had a
good enough home here and ought to stay.
Captain Sager, collector for the Hihn
Company,which supplies water on the east
side, testified that when Dimick paid his
water bill on January 11, he ssid that it
was the last water bill that he woula ever
pay.,
Sager asked if Dimick intended to go to
San Diego, to which he replied that he did
not know, but that Sacer wouid not find
him there when he presented his bill next
month. -^ --'.'U^
Witness said Dimick was restless and
wanted to sell out and go away. He
seemed very different mentally from what
he did six months ago. Various incidents
described by other witnesses showed
Dimick's restless desire to get away from
Santa Cruz.
. Just before the inquest closed the Coro
ner heard that A. L. Hill had received a
sum of money from Dimick, to be sent
East. Mr. Hill was sent for, but declared
that he bad received no money and knew
nothing ol it.
He said Dimick's first wife was buried
at Salisbury, Mo., in December, 1895,
where the remains were taken from here
by Dimick and a niece and nephew of the
deceased wife, who had come here during
her illness.
CAPT. W. WEBSTER McNEIL.
One of the kindest of gentlemen that
ever put pen to paper, that ever spoke
word to man, is Mr. W. W. McNeil. Hos-
pital Steward of the Second Artillery, N.
G. C. Mr. McNeil is not very talkative,
but what he says he means, and when he
does say anything it is with the beat inten-
tion in the world, tie has none but the
best feeling for Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
ri!la, and gladly told the writer of the
great good Joy's baa done. Said he: "I
used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla because
I felt dull, heavy, almost sluggish. A^
soon as I discovered that I needed some
thing to make me feel good I tooii a bottle
of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. and after
uung the second bottle I became my old
self a^ain. Mind you, I wa9 not on the
brink of the grave; 1 merely wanted a
blood medicine and I used Joy's. Yes; I
found the remedy pleasing to take and
effective."
No druggist owns stock in Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla. Any druggist claim-
ing to pay its advertising bills is a fraud
Don't let the drug cierk talk you into
buying something else for Joy's Vegetable
Sarsapariila. He laughs at you when you
leave ihe corner store with a substitute.
Watch him.

FOR HIS LIFE
The Giant Mongolian Has
Left This Field of
Strife.
He Became Alarmed as the
Price on His Head
Increased.
The Coroner's I- quest Threw No
Further Light on the Murder
of "Litte Pate."
"Big Jim," the Chinese plutocrat and
hated rival of the murdered "Little Pete,"
has fled the town for his life. The giant
Mongolian owns a clubhouse on Waverly
place, various business houses and banks
in this City, but he ca^t business aside
when he learned that $SCOO had been of
fered for his head. Wednesday last he
caught a train and surrounded by his
guards rolled over the rails to his farm
near Fresno.
Full well he knew that lurking in the
dimiy lighted streets and alleys of China
town were scores of highbinders thirsting
for his b'ood. Many of the pagan friends
that were willing and anxious to cut short
"Big Jim's" life are strangers to tbe
frightened, respectable Chinese element.
They flocked from interior and coast
towns when they learned that there was
blood money to be earned in this City.
Everywhere "Big Jim" went in this City
he was closely guarded by a Caucasian
and never permitted him out of his sight.
The strain on his nerves, however, soon
became too great, and he decided to leave
the field of contention and strife.
Whether he is safer on his ranch than in
this City remains to be seen. The Fr.sno
Chinamen have offered $1000 to the man
who will slav nini, and it is safe to say
that many a hatchetman will stalk around
tbe "Bie Jim " ranch ready to assassinate
Us owner when oppor'unity offers itself.
THE INQUEST.
No Further Light Thrown on the
Murder of Little Pete.
The inquest on the body of Little Pete
officially established two facts. First that
Little Pete is dead and second that he
was murdered while in a barber-shop.
Further than this nothing was presented
to throw any light upon the tragedy.
Those witnesses who may or may not
have possessed knowledge as to the dark
deed and darker motives that prompted
it knew enough to keep silent as to im
portant points. A proper regard for their
owt safety had something to do with their
silence.
Autopsy Physician Morgan discussed
the position of the fatal bullets. George
Welch, a private watchman, testified that
he was in a tailor-shop near by and saw
two men running away from tbe scene of
the vboctine. He led the officers to 12*
Waverly place, where the tnen weni, and
found them. Tho men were arrested.
Welch believed that the two Chinese
(brought to the inquest) were the men he
saw and who were arrested.
Won Lung, who was being shaved at the
time the snooting took place, testified* that
some one went into the shop and began
shooting. His barber ran away and he
followed. Wong Chung, the barber, testi
fied that he was walking into an adjoining
room for a towel when the shooting began.
He did not Know who did it, although be
beard four shots. He thought that there
were several men in the party that did the
shooting, but he was not sure. In fact
he was like the other witnesses and not
sure of anything in particular.
Alter listening to such testimony for an
hour or two the jury turned in the follow
ing stereotyped verdict:
We find that Fong thing, aged 34 years,
nativity China, occupation merchant, resi
dence 819 Washington street, City and County
of San Francisco, came to his death January
23, at 817 Washington street, said City and
Couniy, from shock from gunshot wounds,
and we further find the wounds were inflicted
by persons or a person unknown to us.
WILL PRESERVE PEACE.
Chief Crowiey Details Two Hun
dred Patrolmen to China
town.

tion ct Trouble.
The prospects oi a Happy New Year are
rery slim for those residents of the Chi
nese quarter who cannot enjoy themselves
according to the strictest ideas of law and
order as interpreted by vigilant members
of the police force.
Two hundred patrolmen under the im
mediate control of teri sergeants and thÂ«
entire detail commanded by Captain Witt
man will be distributed through China
town. The men were instructed yester
day afternoon that not the slightest
breach of the peace will be tolerated, and
any congregations of hard-looking Ceies
tiais will be dispersed with more vigor
than gentleness.
Two patrol wagons are to be in attend
ance to carry away the petty malefactors
who are expected to be influenced by
Chinese gin to celebrate too boisterously.
If the batchetmen take any part in this
year's festivities they will have to show a
remarkable degree of caution, for with
the men to go on duty there to-day, many
of whom are strangers to Chinatown,
every Chinaman will be an object of sus
picion, ana the known members of the
murderous tongs will be shadowed by the
men of experience in the Chinese squad.
One hundred men will go on duty at 7
o'clock this morning, ana the other hun
dred wilj. serve at night.
SOUTfISIDE OLUB.
At a Meeting on Thursday Considera
ble Business Was Transacted.
A meeting of the Southside Improve
ment Club was held in the parlors of the
Hughes House, 214 Third, Thursday even
ing, at which Dr. Tullio A. Rottanzi, the
president, presided, with the following
property - owuers in attendance: J. C.
-Meussdorffer, 8. Schwartz, Julius Lerale,
P. H. Cahill, Thomas F. Mullee, R. E.
Cole, Barney Jacobs, A. Becker, Leon
Samuel, I. Goodman. B. Katchinski, H.
A. Cole, C. Attell, J. 8. Elliott, J. M.
otrauss.
A discussion was had over the general
improvement of Third street and its co
operation with Folsom street, which has
. b * en recently declared a boulevard. Witn
Â«uÂ§ object in view the foliowiug commit- J
tee was appointed to co-operate with the
Folsom-street Improvement Club: Leon
Samuels, P. H. Cahill, R. Â£- Cole, J. M.
Strauss, I. Schwartz and Dr. T. A. Rot
tanzi. The obntinancy of the property
owners on the block from Market to Mis
sion street, with a few exceptions, was
commented on, and in order to try and
persuade those stiff-necked ones to join in
with the others a commutee of three, con
sisting of B. Katchinski, A. Baker and C.
Attell, was appointed to interview them
and induce them to join with the others.
It was announced that Third street,
fiom Mission to Harrison, would be light
ed with electric lights inside of a week,
and that it would be fit and proper to
have a celebration on that occasion.
To carry this idea out the chair ap
pointed B. Jacobs, Julius Lamle, J. C.
Meussdorffer, J. H. Cavanagh and W. S.
Hughes a committee to make all suitable
arrangements.
J. M. Strains offered a resolution in
donin; the '1% cent carfare bi.l now be
fore the .Legislature, and also a vote of
thanks to the San Francisco delegation for
its support of the same.
Owing to other duties Dr. Rottanzi re
signed his seat as president. This led to
a general election all around, with the fol
lowing result: Rienzi Hughes, president;
B. Katchinski, vice-president; 8.
Schwartz, secretary ; Bernard Jacobs, treas
urer, and P. H. Cahill, sergeant-at-arms.
The new president was authorized to
appoint an *xecutive committee of
twenty, the names of whom will ba an
nounced at the next meeting.
SUPERVISORS WONDERED
Then They Refused to Approve
Bills for Turkey and
Fixings.
A Bill for Surgical Instruments
Failed, Along With Quail and
Asparagus-
Supervisor Rottanzi pnlled out a whet
stone at the City Hull yesterday ana
sharpened a long-Dladed knife, and then
went into the several supervisorial com
mittees in which he is included and pre
pared to do a slashing business.
He had not been sitting long in the
Committee on Health and Police when a
bill of Waller Bros, amounting to ?254 90
came along. This was for surgical in
struments furnished to the Receiving
Hospital. The bill had been approve! by
Dr. Weill. Supervisor Delaney and Super
visor Kottanzi cast a side glance at this
bill when it was up before the committee
last week. During the week, by agree
ment, Supervisor Rottanzi went about to
inquire into the reasonableness of the
charges.
"I Jound out," said Supervisor Rot
tanzi yesterday, "that the same instru
ments can be bought in open marfce for
$IGB 05, which is a difference of $86 85.
Where there was any question I inquired
the price of the imported instruments,
putting them in at the full prce. Tin,
difference still remained nearly $90."
The committee also leurned another
; singular tact, which was that the bill of
Waller Bros, bad been "O K'd" by Dr. Weill
before he had opene.i the cases containing
the instruments. The result of this
knowledge was that the committee re
fused to approve the bill.
3am L. Waller of the firm of Waller
Bros, made an explanation of the transac
tion. He was authorized by the old Board
of Supervisors to purchase $600 worth of
instruments for the Receiving Hospital.
The instruments were to be selected by
Dr. Weill. The last-named City official
would not consent to purchase th."c instru
ments of any one except Beroet Bros.,
whose store is near the new City Hull.
Waller went to one other place with Dr.
Weill and proposed to visit others, but
could not persuade Dr. Weill to go with
him. Consequently thÂ«rp was no com
petition in prices. Mr. Waller charged 15
per cent profit for himseif, taking a trade
discount of 10 per cent ami a profit ei>ove
the open market rate of 5 per cent. This
he considered only reasonable pay for his
trouble. He will try to make the dealers
take the instruments, back for the
City will not pay any such price for them.
Waller was exonerated from all blame.
Dr. Rottanzi was instructed to buy the
needed instruments.
Shortly after this happening the Finance
Committee sat. It opened its eyes when
Dr. Rottanzi eniered objection to a bill of
luxuries from the AlmshouÂ«e amounting
to $106 15. But all the members of the
committee involuntarily smacked their
lips as they thought of the delicacies
which the Almshouae people have en
j joyed.
For on the bill, which represented only
supplies furnished from December 2 to
December 30, inclusive of botti dates, were
mentioned turkey and cranberries repeat
edly, the latter presumably having been
convened into a prime article of cran
berry sauce to make the tuTkey 3lip down
( mcial throats more ea3ily. The bill
omitted to mention the price of turkey
per pound or chicken per pound or any
thing else per pound. The viands were
simply furnished in delicious bulk with
out any unpalatable details on the bill to
clog the delights of feasting.
There was a long list of delicacies.
Mouths watered at the thought of as
paragus, pineapples, bananas, Japanese

STILL NO SWANHILDA.
British Ship Burtnah Arrive* From
N'cwciMtli-, but SlarteU Little *arl ier
Than the Square- digger.
The Swanhilda will not come in and
everybody who takes any interest in the
capture of Butler, the so-called murderer,
is getting disgusted. "Square-riggers"
have been reported time and again, but
on almost every occasion the vessel has
proven to be either a coaster or a biirk,
while the long-looked-for vessel is a four
masted ship. The following messaee,
dated "Farallon Island, January 28, 1897,
11:45 A. m.," was received by A. Carlisle,
417 Montgomery street, yesterday:
Square-rigged ship just hove in sight about
fltteen nil:es (.ouih'.vest. LcÂ«t night a! sunset
sighted a ship to soutnward. Too thick and
.dark to make her oui. W. A. Beeman.
Mr. Carlisle has a number of carrier
pigeons out at the lighthouse station and
every "square-rigger" lighted means the
liberation of one of the bird*. They go
direct to the owners' lofts in Berkeley
and from there the news is telephoned to
San Francisco.
The ship reported by the carrior pigeon
upon coming close in was reported by the
Merchants' Exchange to be the British
ship Burmah. sixty-nine days from New
castle, N. S. W. She started four days
ahead of the Swanhilda.
The Burmah reported having had south
erly and easterly winds to latitude 38 deg.
south, westerly winds to latitude 30 deg.
south, northeast and easterly winds from
latitude 30 deg. south to 29 deg. north,
longitude 14 deg. 34 mm. west. She
crossed the equator on the last day of the
year, in longitude 124 deg. west. From
that time and place to this port she had
westerly and southeast winds.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, /JANUARY 30, 1897.
FATHER YORKE
CRACKING NUTS
Lectured to a Crowded
House in South San
Francisco.
His Purpose Was to Show That
Catholics Founded Religious
Liberty.
Y. M. I Members Occupied the Stage
and There Was a Solo by
Mrs. Trey.
"Nuts to Crack" was the title of Rev.
Father Yorke's lecture last night in the
Opera-house in South San Francisco. It
was delivered to "standing-room only,"
under the auspices of Youne Men's In
stitute No. 32. A solo was sung by Mrs.
Troy.
Past Grand President Fran* Kierce
presided, and in his speech introducing
Father Yorke he reviewed the history of
the Y. M. I. Prominent members of In
stitute No. 32 were seated on the stage.
Father Yorke reviewed the history of
the Roman Catholic church from its in
ception almost down to date. One object
of his lectures, he said, was education.
Many Protestants were sincere in their
beliet and antipathy against the Catholic
church, and he desired to present facts
which would enlighten them. The
Catholic chuich was not opposed to edu
cation. It did not want to keep the
people ignorant in order that it might
more effectually rule over them. The
Catholic church had taught the barbarians
of early history, and had it not been for
that church very little learning would
have been preserved to the world. The
word of God and works of art had been
saved by the monks.
"It has been said that the man who
lifts up his voice against the Roman
Catholic church owes it to that
church that he can speak at all." be said.
"The schools and universities of Eu
rope," be continued, "were founded by
the Catholic church, among them Ox
ford and Cambridge. Tbe same was true
in France, Germany and Italy. While
nations and empires bad passed away the
Catholic church has continued through
2000 years and was growing stronger. Still
there were people who claimed that it was
played out and could not exist in free
America. Before the reformation and be
fore the star of liberty had shown its.'lf
in the Western world a Catholic had pre
vailed upon a Catholic Queen to pawn her
jewels, and had planted a Catholic cross,
wiih Catholic i ravers, on the shore of
the New World. The Catholics had been,"
he said, "loremosi in learning â in reiigion,
in exploration, in daring deeds ani
colonization for Christ, church and civil
ization. Catholics bad discovered and ex
plored nearly all sections of America and
been first in California.''
How the enemies of the Catholic church
got it into their heads that the church is
opposed to liberty was a hard nut to
crack. The Catholics had been first in
this couulry for religious liberty. Jesuits,
seemed to be a nightmare to Protestants,
who seemed to fear.. that if the Catholics
got in the majority they would start the
fires of the inquisition again.
England, up to the sixteenth century, was
a Catholic country. He said that during
the time Luther was stirring up Europe
Henry VIII. who had been called "a
royal ass and a kingly swine," became
enamoured of another woman and sought
to putawav his wife. The Catholic church
does not recognize divorce, and the Pope
allowed the whole Kingdom of England
to go into schism and heresy rather than
do wrong even to the smallest of Christ's
children. That was the beginning of
Protestantism in England. The peo
ple were turned ' into Protestants
and persons were burned who
did not" agree â¢ with that church.. Sects
multiplied and fought each other for 200
years. Som<* tired of persecution got'
away from England, sailed for America
and founded" colonies, seeking in the
wilderness freedom of conscience for.
themselves, but careful not to allow it to
anybody else. Though Puritans, Quakers
and other sects quarreled with each
other, all agreed that the Papist should
hnve no show. Catholic priests actually
laid down their lives for the crime of say
in? masÂ«.
"In 1683 ;Lord Calvert, afterward Lord
Baltimore, and others from England,
saile i up the Chesapeake, landed at a
place called St. Mary's, founded a colons'
and what is now known as the State of
Maryland," continuea Father Yorke.
"They were suDreme in thnt colony; they
hadT a charter from England. It was tliis
colony of Maryland which made religion
free to Protestants alike, where the perse
cuted Puritan or Quaker mijrnt seek a safe
refuge, gaihered mi one brotherhood under
that freedom of worship which ia 'he
highest star in our flag."
The speaker said that after Roger
Williams, who was a Baptist, returned
from England with a charter that no man
sdould bu interfered with in his religious
belief the first thing that was done was to
pass an act that Catholics be deprived of
all rights, and all Catholics were disen
franchised. The lecturer said the first
declaration of liberty in this country was
made by Catholics, and added: "1 would
like to have them crack that nut for me."
Thomas Dungan, a Catholic, made Gov
ernor or New York by Charles 11, put for
ward a charter of religious liberty, but,
said tbe speaker, w en a Protestant was
appointed in Dungan's place the charter
was repealed.
Father Yorke drew from history to show
that Catholics had taken a eadnig part in
the Revolution and the War of the Re
bellion, and that Washington recognized
that fact in regard to the Revolution.
"Above all, thank God," he said, "Catho
lics are tolerant."
Father YorKe promised to reply to Rev.
Mr. Coyle of Oakland in a lecture he will
deliver soon in Oakland.
HUGO HEROLD'S RECITAL
The San Francisco Barytone Is
Very Warmly Re
ceived.
A larce number of music lovers were at
tracted to Golden Gate Hall last night to
hear the singing of Hugo R. Herold, who
recently returned home to this City after
winning a number of musical successes in
Europe.
The choice of programme showed that
the California singer's taste inclines more
toward concert than toward opera. Some
of Mr. Herold's friends were disappointed
that he had not given them a single
operatic aria in arranging last night's
programme, but the selections showed
such culture and refined taste that no
iover of music had anything to regret in
any of the numbers.
'JL'he vocal part of toe concert was all
contributed by Hugo Herold, his clusters
of songs coming between instrumental
numbers. The recitai opened with Adam's
famous "Cantique de Noel,' 1 the robust
style of which suited the singer's voice
admirably.
Mr. Herold is a rather deep barytone,
his voice being full and even throughout
its entire compass, and it shows great
cultivation and finish. The "Cantique de
Noel" brought the enthusiastic encore it
deserved, and the singer responded by re
peating it, using the English instead of
the French text.
The first cluster of songs consisted of
Goring Thomas' "Dream Fancies," C.
Paston Cooper's "Where?" and Gounod's
"The Fountain Mingles With the River."
They were all excellently sung, the final
one being the best number for displaying
the singer's voice. In response to another
warm encore Mr. Herold responded by re
prating "Wh re?"
In the next song cluster Schumann's
â¢'lch Grolle Nicht."and Rubinstein's "Dv
Bist Wie Eine Blume" were especially
well sune. A 8 an encore Mr. Herold re
pealed Grieg's "Em Scuwan." The con
cert also mc uded songs by Quaranta and
Tosti and Schubert's "Erl King."
In all tbe four languages, English,
French, German and Italian, Mr. Herold's
enunciation was equally distinct and ex
pressive. He was sympathetically accom
panied by Miss Genevieve Maroney.
The instrumental part of the programme
was contributed by Minetti and Roderick
Herold, who opened the concert with
GriÂ°g's sonata in F for violin and piano.
Later in the programme Mr. Minetti's
playing of Sarasate's "Spanish Dances"
and Wieniawski's "Airs Russes" won him
enthusiastic encores.
AMONG THE WORKING MEN
A Bg Mass- Meeting to Protest
Against the Sailor
Laws.
The Southwick Convict Goods Bil
Indorsed â Tenement-House
Male C;gars.
Several matters of interest were dis
cussed at the meeting of the San Francisco
Labor Council last evening. The first
was a resolution passed recently by the
Ironmolders' Union indorsing the South
wick bill, now pending before Congress.
The resolution recited that the industries
of California have been for years cripplsd
by t.'.e unjust and unfair competition with
the Eastern State prisons that have
shipped their convict goods into the Pacific
Coast markets and sold the same as free
goods, but at ruinously low prices. Many
buy these articles under the impression
that they are the product of free men.
The Southwick bill provides that all such
goods be marked or branded so tnat the
public may know what it is purchasing.
The resolution says:
Resolved, By Ironmolders' Union No. 164 of
San Francisco, that we earnestly request the
Congressional Committee on Labor an (i Capi
tal to report favorably on said Souihwick bill,
now in its possession, at an early dale, that
the same may be adopted by Congress and go
into operation at once, so that our people may
have the much-needed relief it will-afford.
Tbe council indorsed the resolution and
the secretary was directed to send copies
of the same to the committee named and
to ail of the Pacific Coast representatives
at Washington.
The delegates from the Sailors' Union
stated that on next Wednesday evening
there will be a mass-meeting at Metro
politan Temple, the purpose of which is
to protest against enactments in the mari
time laws now being made by Congress.
Ed Rosenberg stated that Senator Frye
of Maine is doing all in his power to revive
the sailor slavery of former days, when
seamen could be flogged at tbe direction
of brutal masters and be imprisoned in
American ports on the slightest exense
and where no crime is committed. He
cited the case of the foftr Arago sailors on
this coast, who were imprisoned for nine
months simply because they declined to
sail irom a northern port after having
signed articles in this port The United
States Supreme Court decided in favor of
the ship-owners, and it is likely that the
men will be imprisoned several months
longer when their cases are disposed of in
the United States District Court. The
meeting will be addressed by Mayor
Phelan, James Barry, H. H. Hutton and
other prominent speakers, who will voice
a protest against the m justice to the sea
faring men.
It was decided to bold the meeting
under the auspices of the Labor Council.
The ofQc r< nominated at the last meet
ing, as puulishel in The Call, were
elected and installed.
Michael Raphael, business agent of the
cigar-makers' unions of New York, deliv
ered an interesting address upon the sub
ject of tenement-house-made cigars. He
spoke particularly of one large firm that
employs thousands of persons who live in
the vilest of surroundings ana scarcely
earn $9 a week when the whole family la-
Dors. The cigars made under these con
ditions are regarded and sold by the mil
lions on the Pacific Coast as the oest. He
is making a tight against the firm in ques
tion because the firm refuses to better rhe
condition of its employes. The council
passed a resolution indorsing the move
ment of the blue label crusade that Mr.
Raphael represents.

leaving but the immediate relatives to bid
a final adieu.
There was no concourse of visitors, and
the usual formalities attending the fune

ers and floral offerings, were entirely dis
pensed with. N. Gray, the undertaker,
provided the body- bearers, and with two
black horses attached to the hearse, the
casket was silently borne to its last resting
place in Laurel Hill cemetery, followed
by four carriages.
Two of these contained James L. Flood,
Richard H. Folhs and his son James H.

There was a stormy meeting of the
Iroqaois Club last night and it was nearly
midnight when the warring factions dis
persed.
The friends of the Police and Fire de
partments were numerous at the meeting.
Police Court clerks. Fire Department em
ployes and many from the Street Depart
ment packed the halls and a desperate
effort was made to hare the ciub indorse
those bills now pending in the Legislature
which seek to increase the salaries of de
tectives and of nearly everybody in the
Fire Department.
After a long, Heated debate the Fire and
Police departments were defeated, except
that the club favored a paid Fire Depart
ment and recommended thnt Fire Chief
Sullivan's salary be raised to $5000.
Joseph Leggett and Raymond Robins
made arguments against the proposed
bills. Mr. Legeett said it wonld be crimi
nal folly to pay out more money at a time
when the public schools are about to close
for lack of funds. He said that the pro
posed measure would increase the ex
penses of the City nearly $200,000 per
annum.
The attempt to have the Â«lub indorse
the pending bills was defeated by a Tote

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Cabinet making proereÂ«ses.
McKinley is doing the job well.
Lyman Gage will suit the office and the
country.
Craelman is certainly a myth â there
cannot be any such Ã¼biquitous cuss.
The passage of the glove contest bill
gives Nevada a fighting chancofor a boom.
The Chronicle calls it "creelmanizing,"
but "longgreening" would be better.
Leave your orders to-day for The Sun
day Call and provide your leisure with
good reading.
All that Nevada asks of the aountry is
to furnish the prize-fighters. She will fur
nish the sand.
Eastern storms are destructive, but our
so-called storms are rains that bring a
blessing with them.
It seems that Lyman Gage voted for
Cleveland in 18S4, but he repented early
and never did it again.
Professor Langley gives good reports oi
his airship and the next thing he gives us
ought to be a public trial.
When Senator Dubois left the Republi
can party he stepped on the toboggan
Blide and now he is in the snowdrift.
The Legislature is making as much of
the payroll scandal as if it expected never
to have another, and let us hope it won't.
Among the features of The Sunday
Call there are some of special interest to
you. Don't fail to get the paper and read
them.
Idaho sends to the United States Senate
a Populist who has never been known to
make a speech. This is a real surprise
party.
The Senatorial fight in Washington
seems to be so hot at both ends it is im
possible to handle it either way with
safety.
According to the Examiner Li Yung
Yuen is in Havana and San Francisco at
tiie same time, and as for Creelman he is
every w Here.
The Illinois Legislature has tackled the
job of regulating department store?, just
as if it were not something of a variety
junkshop itself.
If Congress undertakes to prevent the
scalping of railroad tickets it ought at the
same time prevent the price of those tick
ets from scalping the pubiic.
A great splutter has arisen in Chicago
over a proposition to give the Mayor
$20,000 a year, and it is safe to say that
many a Mayor has helped himself to more
money without making half the noise.
The Examiner has at last found out the
name of the Chinrse Consul-General in
this City, and if it had not stopped to
fake that Chine3e dispatch it might have
found it out on the clay Little Pete was
killed.
San Francisco can well afford to be gen
erous in her aid to the stricken people of
India, for California has profited by the
loss of the Indian wheat crop and it is
only right for us to help those from whose
injury we have derived gain.
The rams will be of benefit to miners
who wish to work their claims as well as
to the farmers and orchardists. In fact,
almost every industry in the State has
been benefited and the outlook for pros
perity has been brightened by the clouds.
The Chronicle recalls the "special cable"
of the Examiner asserting that the Colima
had "split on a rock," when she really
sank in sixty fathoms of water, "and it is
hardly necessary for the Examiner to re
iterate the statement and add that it was
absolutely true."
Any and every bill before the Legis
lature that tends its any way to prevent or
check the construction of railways ought
to be promptly rejected. California needs
more facilities for transportation and it
would be folly to enact laws that would
diminish the chance of getting them.
It is only a short time ago that the
Bradley-Martins were caught in what
looked very much like smuggling articles
of wearing apparel through the Custom
house, and now they are going to give a
$300,000 ball and masquerade, but of course
none of the family will appear as smug
glers.
The rapidity with which Randsburg has
developed from the wild and wooliy stage
to the customs of high society is astonish
ing. It is already enjoying a report that
the prettiest married woman in the dis
trict has eloped with a handsome young
man, and all that it Jacks now is a di
vorce case, an opera-house and a bicycle
rink.
Let us give the little devil his due.
When The Call began to supply the
people of California with the news service
of the United Press Willie Hearst had
sense enough to see that it was the best in
the world and at once followed the lead of
The Call and obtained the same service
for the Examiner. This showed a degree
of perspicacity on the part of the faker,
but it does not justify him in bragging
that his paper has now a better news ser
vice than The Call.
BEWARE OF THE BLACKMAILER.
The time is approaching when the Supervisors will be called upon to fix the rates
which the water and the gas companies will be permitted to charge consumers.
This duty is one of the most important which devolve upon the Supervisors, and
the people look to those officials to deal with it honestly and impartially, so that no
extortion or inequalities may be practiced upon citizens by these corporations.
Public expectation of a favorable consideration of the claims of consumers against
any excessive charges of the companies is at this time well founded. The address of
Mayor Phe lan on taking office called attention to some of the alleged abuses of the
companies, and urged upon tne Supervisors a thorough invesiigation of the subject.
If the honest members of the board be upheld there is a fair assurance of relief for the
people from many, if not from all, of the things of which they have complained in
the past
Until yesterday everything looked well for the proposed reform. There was every
prospect that the work would be undertaken in the proper way, that an honest and
thorough investigation would be made and good results obtained. There is now,
however, a menace of danger. A new factor has been introduced into the problem.
There is a threat that forebodes divisions and dissensions.
The Examiner has entered the field ravening for booale and blackmail.
It has sprung forth to attack the companies with a fierceness which can be as
suaged only by money. It has devised methods which will enable it to seize its prey
without leaving its ambush. If it should furnish facts, figures, arguments and statis
tics on which to base a claim for a reduction of rates it will not fee done to benefit the
public, but to enable itself to levy blackmail. It will get up monster petitions. It
will put these to the front. If the companies come down with the coin these petitions
will be dropped in the wastebasket. The people are to do the fighting. The Exam
iner is to get the spoils.
The Examiner methods of dealing with corporations have been frequently exposed
and are well understood. When it drew $1000 a month from the railroad company it
had no word to fay for the rights of the public. When Mr. Huntington flung off the
horseleech it began at once to circulate a monster petition. That much is of record,
and its pertinence to the present case is obvious.
it is not known to the public whether the Examiner in the past has drawn sub
sidies from the water and the gas companies as it did from the railroad, but it is
known that in the past it has never got up petitions against them. Tue duty of the
Supervisors to fix rates has lone; been the same as now, the abuses complained of have
been practiced for years, the rights of the people have been in the past as they are to
day, but the Examiner has never been eetting ud petitions on the subject until now.
To those who have watched the course of the Examiner and its proprietor of late
there will be no surprise in this sudden change of tactics. Cut off from the subsidy it
is known to have received Iroin the Southern Pacific Company, and perhaps deprived
of wonted subsidies from other companies, the Examiner has been a losing fake for
many a day. The drain of the New York Journal on Mr. Hearst's pocket, already
amounting to millions, has added to the embarrassment of the Examiner. Mr. Hearst
has expended all the money he is permitted to draw from his father's estate. He
never earned an honest dollar in his life. It is now necessary to make money, how
ever, and Long Green Lawrence has been turned loose to gather it how he can.
To earn money legitimately is beyond tho faculties of tne Examiner management.
Fakers they are while faking is profitable, and wnen that fails they turn to even more
questionable mean 3. The offer of a "yard of daisies" or of bull pups for advertise
ments does not always bring them. The offer of a comic song every Sunday does not
appeal to people who care enough for newspapers to subscribe for them. The Exam
iner is at the end of its fakes and at the end of Hearst's inherited wealth. It longs to
return to the subsidies of old, and is now petitioning for them under the guise of peti
tioning for a reduction in water and gas rates.
It is, we believe, unnecessary for us to do more at this time than to warn the
public against the danger which lies in this threat of the Examiner. The companies
will not need such a warning. They have doubtless had the same experience as the
Southern Pacific. It is to the people, therefore, the warning must be given. The
citizens of San Francisco are tired of that viciousness which thrives on public abuses.
They desire to see an end of cinch-bill legislation and blackmail journalism. They
wish justice done to property and to manhood alike.
Along these lines oi honesty The Call has pursued its way, under its past and its
present management. It protects the rights of the people against any possible
injustice of corporations or monopolies, but will never fail to defend honestly invested
capital from the attacks of blackmailers. It will expose all such rascals as the
Examiner, and continue to hold them up to the scorn and contempt of honest men.
A WELCOME BAIJT.
No illustration more impressive of the i
difference between the climate of Califor- *
nia and that of the East can be found than >
in the contrast of what is rignified in the
two sections by the word "storm." We '
have just had what we call a storm and
the East has had a similar experience. In
the East the storm came with heavy snow,
driven by icy blizzards, destroyinc crops
andorchards in the rural districts, carry
ing suffering and often death to the poorly
fed people of the cities and bringine ex
treme discomfort even to the richest. In '
California the storm has come in a rain
which in a literal sense has showered ;
blessings o'er the smiling land.
The rains which have juÃt fallen have
been fairly general in their nature and
will be of immense profit to the State, j
The miners in the mountains have hailed
them with welcome, because they have
enabled mining claims to be worked with
greater ease and profit. Farmers in the
San Joaquin received them with satisfac
tion, because they mean better crops, both
of hay and of grain. To orchardists
they have been as timely as if they had
been ordered. Thousands of young trees
were set out durine the fair weather which
preceded the rain, and the so-called storm
has come just in time to furnish them the
moisture needed for their speedy growth
and development.
It would be impossible to calculate the
benefit the rain which has just fallen has
been to the State, It has been timely in
every sense of the word. It will nourish
everything that grows and add to the
wealth that will be produced during the
coming season. It gives a fair assurance
to all cultivators of the soil that they will
reap from their labors a bountiful harvest
and find during the year a prosperity
which wiil abundantly repay the work of
their hands.
Up to this time the winter has been an
almost ideal one. It has furnished rain
and sunshine in exactly the alternations
that were most beneficial to the people of all
sections of the State. We had the early rains
which were needed to start the fail pastures
with grass and prepare the way for fall
plowing. Then came the interlude of fair
weather which enabled the plowing to
be done, and afterward in due season
came further rain. Then followed the
fair weather of the past weeks during
which the planting of new trees in
orchards was briskly carried forward until
the work was accomplished, and now on
the young trees has fallen the rain which
was necessary for them.
Unless something unforeseen happens
and some late frost falls this will be a
great year for the producers of California.
We call these rainfalls by the name of
storms, but we do not think them so.
They are not like the storms of the East.
They do not come with disasters, but
with blessings. They are not dreaded but
welcome.
LYMAN GAGE.
In the selection of Lyman Gage of Chi
cago for the office of Secretary of the
Treasury President-elect McKinley has
been even more fortunate than in gaining
Senator Sherman for the office of Secre
tary of State. Mr. Gage is not so eminent
nor perhaps so strong a man as Senator
Sherman, but while the Senator will be a
doubtful quantity in the State office Mr.
Gage is undoubtedly by training, experi
ence and ability well fitted for the duty
of conducting the affairs of the depart
ment to which he has been called.
There are lew bankers in the country
more eminent than Mr. Gage and none
more favorably regarded or held in higher
esteem both by the public and by bankers.
His reputation in the community is due
to the fact that he has made himself
known as something more than a busi
ness banker. He has studied the subject
of finance in all its branches and has
taken a prominent part in the recent dis
cussions of the subject. To him banking
is something more than lending money
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1897.
across the counter on good security. Be
recognizes its relation to finance gener
ally, and understands that banking is but
a portion of the great work" which finance
does ir>the mechanism of modern society.
He will enter his office, therefore, broadly
cultured on the subject of his duty, and
will be well able to fulfill it with usefulness
to the public and honor to himself.
While Mr. Gage has been more noted
as a financier than as a statesman, there
can be no question of his fitness to per
form the statesman's work in dealing
with the financial problems of the Gov
ernment. He is a true Republican, and is
in sympathy with the party on all the
great issues of the time. In a recent in
terview he declared that he was in full
agreement with President-elect McKinley
not only on the money question but on
the tariff. He stands for all that is im
plied in sound money, protection and re
ciprocity, and will be a true representative
of genuine Republicanism.
In another respect Mr. Gage is a man
whose appointment to high office will be
satisfactory to the people. He is one of
those self-made men whom Americans
delight to honor. His success in lile has
been due to his own industry, energy and
talents. He has risen to high positions
because he has shown himself faithful in
those of a subordinate character. Every
work intrusted to his hands has been
rightly performed. He has never been a
deficit banker and he will not ba a deficit
Secretary of the Treasury. We can look
to him for an efficient management of the
finances of the Nation and be well as
sured that when he retires from office he
will deserve the commendation of the
people in the words, "Good and iaithful
servant, well done I"
NEWS SEEVIOE.
That the managers of the Examiner have
no appreciation of the real Issue between
legitimate journalism and fake journalism
is made evident by the manner and tone
of the reply which they make to the ex
posure of the Chinese dispatch story which
they recently published. Instead of reply
ing to the charge that the story was a fake
ridiculous on its face they enter into a
long, labored, vehement and uncalled for
delense of their general news service.
The Call has never condemned that
part of the news service of the Examiner
whicn is genuine. It has had no reason
for so doing. As soon as The Call passed
into the hands of the present proprietor it
began to furnish the people of San Fran
cisco and California with the news reports
of the United Associated Press. The ex
cellence of this service and its superiority
over any hitherto Known on the coast was
soon manifest, and it is to the credit of
Mr. Hearst that he had the sagacity to soe
it and aaopt it. The Examiner therefore
at the present time receives the same news
service as The Call. This fact is a suffi
cient proof of the perspicacity of Mr.
Hearst, but it certainly does not justify
him or his managers in claiming that they
have a better news service than anybody
else, or in publishing ridiculous fakes and
reiterating that they are true when the
public well knows they are false.
Our objection is not to the news service
of the Examiner, but to its fakes. Any
reports it receives from the United Press
are all right, bat the reports it gets by the
fakelectropbone from such personages as
the Emperor of China are certainly to be
condemned. To sell such fakes for news
is to obtain money under false pretenses,
and to brag about tin m and to reiterate
them shows something like a total de
pravity of the intellect or a degeneration
of the brain tissue.
The Chronicle of yesterday pointed out
some of the recent fakes oJ the Examiner
and showed in a humorous way now
ridiculous the Examiner managers are
making themselves in persistently brag
ging of its fakes instead of its genuine
news. For example, the Examiner now
boasts of the dispatches it received during
the Chino-Japanese war from an alleged
correspondent named Creelman. The
Chronicle shows that no Creelman was cot
respondent of the Examiner at the time
when ha was supposed to be reporting the
war. It recalls the fact that the Exam
iner's boasted dispatch of the wreck of the
Colima stated that the steamship had
"split on a rock," when as a matter of fact
it had foundered in sixty fathoms of
water. Several other raw, lurid and
ridiculous fakes of the kind are recalled
by the Chronicle, and the showing is one
whose humor the Examiner may be sure is
heartily onjoyed by the public.
We have no desire to pour vinegar into
open wounds. Our exposure of the Chinese
fake was done as a duty to the public, in
order to save unsuspecting citizens from
the schemes of those who swindle them
with fakes instead of news. We also had
a desire to awaken Mr. Hearst to a sense
of the fact that he is being made a guy by
his long-green manager, and is being
"worked for the stuff" like the softest
thing on record. If the Examiner will
stick to the news service of the United
Associated Press, which it wisely followed
The Call in obtaining, it will receive
public approval. If, however, it has so
little sense of the ridiculous as to persist
in bragging and boasting of what the
Chronicle calls "creelmanizing," it must
expect to be laughed at by the general
public and denounced by those wnom it
swindles.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE A SOLDIER?
There are many men to-day who would leave a "job" to become one of Uncle Sam's sons in
blue.
The records of enlistment show that "many are offered and few are chosen."
But whatever may be your ideas of the pleasant aspect of the soldiers' life, unless you are
actually in the service you do not know the
facts which The Call will tell you about
to-morrow. , ,
In that issue there will be an article upon
how the soldier gets into the service, what his
duties are, hU opportunities and emoluments,
and how he lives at his post.
It will be a graphic and interesting descrip

CREELMANIZING.
San Francisco Chronicle.
In its eagerness to draw the public eye from the harrowing expose of Its Chinese fake the
Examiner makes itself the special champion of James Croelman In his former capacity of war
correspondent of the New York World at the Grand Hotel in Yokohama and the Palace Hotel
in this City. Why it goes back two years and more for the benefit of the World when Mr.
Creelman needs defense for his recent Olney-Canovas canard, perpetrated for the New York
Journal, we cannot say. That is one of the mysteries of the "n. J." At neither of the hotels
where Creelman wrote of battles and sieges in the Chino-Japanese war were his bills paid by
the Examiner. The latter had its own man at the "front," as the bell-boy phrase goes, in the
person of one Morphy, of whom more anon. Mr. Creelman was in other employ, though the
Examiner was permitted, we believe, to borrow his manuscript and exploit the fact as a mar
velous feat of enterprise; but the connection was not cloeo enough to account for the present
anxiety of the Examiner to protect whatever reputation the World man had left when he
hurried back to this country four months before the fight in China was over.
But as our contemporary is so sensitive upon the point we hasten to assure it that Creel
man has been discussed by us not as a person, but as a descriptive term; not as a propor noun,
but as an adjective or participle. The present use of the term "boycott," once the family des
ignation of an Irish landlord, will make our meaning clear. When a newspaper-reading pub
lic has been "creelmanned" we mean that it has been luridly told, for instance, by any new
journal faker, how the Colima, which foundered in sixty fathoms of water, had "split on a
rock." To "creelman" is to report with great circumstantiality of detail that certain bones
found in a Siskiyou cave belonged to a woman who happened at the time to be alive and
well, and that her "murderer," while under arrest, was tormented by the gibbering ghost of
his victim. In brief, "creelmanizing" means that some one, not necessarily the original hum
bug himself, has deceived the public with an elaborate journalistic falsehood.
Take the case of an alleged statement which the Examiner printed some years ago as
coming from ex-Queen Liliuokalani, and of which it now boasts. The story had been put to
gether by a hotel cierk named F. M. English, and had been printed without the former ruler' s
signature. It was a fake pure and simple; that is to say, a creel man. It was entirely natural
to use so convenient a word to describe the faked story of the arrest in China, in the night
after the "Little Pete" murder here, of all the relatives oi the See Yup leaders in San Fran
cisco. The reference was in no sense personal to James Creaiman, who was aot in San Fran -
Cisco or China at the time, but was, at last Recounts, watching for that "looming" revolution
in Spain and for the Olney-Cleveland cartel of complete surrender to Canovas del Castillo.
As to local news service in China in 1894-93, the issue is rather old, not to say stale,
though that may account for the tendency of the n. j. to make much of it. However, if the
Examiner intends to elaborate the theme there is a wide and unharvested field in connection
with the service rendered by its own much-heralded agent, Mr. Morphyâ a gentleman whose
whereabouts while the Chronicle representative was following the Japanese guidons in China
would make an entcr.aining story.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS
Lower rates to the coast is what many men
interested in large enterprise* in California
say the State must have before there is great
prosperity. More people are needed here.
There is an enormous territory comprised in
the State boundaries, and but a small popula
tion considering the advantages that are to be
enjoyed when the would-be locator once gets
here.
All this and much more is being set forth by
the proprietors of different enterprises. C. N.
Haramstt of Chicago, who has for some time
been negotiating for a large tract of laud in
Northern California for colonizing purposes,
is at the Grand. He says that after going into
the question of passenger rates to this const
he does not know whether ho can carry out
his colony scheme.
The rates are too high, far more than the
people can stand, but the transcontinental
roads will give no reduction. The rate ought
to be at least half what it is, Mr. Hammett
claims, to properly induce people to come and
settle here.
"If they made investments in land," said he,
"the railroad could well afford to give this rate.
It would make money by doing so. In fact, if
the State was filled up as it ought to be the
railroad would make enormously more than it
does vow. It is short-sighted, in my opinion,
not to give a reduced rate.
"1 have put a great many people into Kansas
during the last few years and have also been
sending them to surrounding States. The
railroads were all glad to give a cheap rate to
land-seekers, and settlers had other reductions
who bought lands.
"Kansas filled up rapidly in many parts.
The cheap rates in that State, as in others,
were of inestimable value, and the roads made
more than anybody else. There ought to be
vastly reduced rates here. As it is it takes a
big sum of money for the average man and
family to come here, and tney just won't stand
it. They can't. They haven't got It."
A DISTINCT OPINION ON THE
TREATY.
Bridgeport Morning Union.
By forming what the diplomatic world will
insist as regarding as an offensive and defen
sive alliance with our traditional enemy, we
snail offend our traditional friend, Russia,
and her â  friend, our friend and former ally,
France. The support of Russia has been stead
fast and unshaken, and in more than one
crisis her strong arm has been proffered as an
aid. As for what we owe to France, may it
never be forgotten. Shall we turn aside from
the two nations which alone, out of all the
world, entertain amicable feelings toward us
to form an alliance with Great Britain, whose
friendship is a delusion and a snare, and
whose history is a history of deceit and
cruelty ? .-..'..
A final and incidental reason is that the
Senate of the United States should not permit
itself to be bluffed into an action for the grati
fication of two gentlemen who, while making
a grand-stand play for "universal peace," re
fuse to lift a finger to suppress one of the most
murderous and bloody wars of modern his
tory, and one that is being carried on at their
very doorsteps. -â¢ * â¢ â  â â¢â¢-â â 'â â â

SPECIAL TEACHERS
NOT IN FAVOR
The Grand Jury Would
Save Money by Dis
missing Them
A Committee Report That Offers
Suggestions Looking to
Greater Economy.
The Peaces of Teachers Living Across
the Bay Could Be Supplied
From This City.
Tne Grnnd Jury yesterday heard re-
Dorts from two of its committees â those
on public schools and health department.
The committee on schools makes several
suggestions for reducing expenses. One
of these is the dismissal of all extra or
special teachers. It also suggests that
San Francisco could supply the places of
the seventeen teachers that hold places in
its schools but who live in Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley.
Following is the report:
To the Hon. Grand Jury in and for the City
and County of tian Francisco: Your committee
beg to report as follows on tha Board of Edu
cation of this City and County:
1. Number of substitutes engaged â day... 41
Number of substitutes engaged â even
ing 12
53
2. Number actually employedâ day 35
Number actually employedâ night 6
41
During December, 1896, by suspension of
rules 5 substitutes were elected In excess of
the number allowed.
3. Actual cost per montn for substi
tutesâDay $1,400
Evening 200
$1,600
4. Number of unassigned teachers 11
5. Actual amount paid to unassigned
teachers per montn â the aggregate
amount for January. 1897, will be $738
6. Drawing teacher, per month !t>lso
7. Lecturer, with stereopticon, per monthslOO
8. Whole number of teachers 904
Unassigned 11
Day substitutes under pay 35
Day substitutes not underpay 6
Evening substitutes under pay 6
Evening substitutes not under pay 6
On leave of absence 15
983
This committee recommended that the last
fifteen substitute teachers elected De not paid
a salary, but shall be paid only for actual ser
vice rendered, a saving of $600 per month.
PUPILS, TEACHEP.S, SALABIEB.
The following report covers period from
1880 to 1895 inclusive: Pupils increase of
3637, about 12 per cent; teachers increase of
208, about 29 per cent; salaries increase of
$250,677. about 40 percent; average salary
1880. $86 45; average salary 1895, $94 10;
average number of pupils in class 1880, 40;
average number of pupils in class 1895, 35;
decrease of average, 12% per cent.
Increase of salaries may be accounted for by
the decrease of pupils in each class, thereby
increasing number of classes and teachers for
same; the number of special teachers now em
ployed by the department at large salaries
and also the eleven unassigned teachers,
drawing on an average $75 per month each.
Teachers' salaries increase about $7000 per
year, due to increase of pay for time service,
amounting to about $100,000 for the period
above stated, and $100,000 for special teachers,
and $50,000 of the above for natural increase.
Reference is made to the methods em
ployed in the shop and supply depart
ments. The carpenter-shop was abolished
two years ago, and the chairman of the
Building and Grounds Committee of the
Board of Education employs and dis
charges the men. The inspector of build
ings assigns the men to their work and
Keeps their time, which he reports to the
storekeeper daily. Carpenters are paid
$2 50, plumbers and painters $4 and me
chanics $3 50 per day. Most all supplies
are contracted for and samples furnished
the storekeeper so that he may make com
parisons with goods delivered. It is sug
gested that a double entry account be
kept with each school so as to keep track
oi its cost.
The committee suggest that the follow
ing teachers be dropped, namely:
One physical culture.
One Spanish (day).
One SDanlsh (evening).
One drawing teacher.
One free-hand drawing.
Three cooking.
Two manual training.
These teachers coat $1150 per month.
There are seventeen non-resident leacherÂ«
in the department as follows:
Residing in Oafciandâ Miss E. A. Dunn, Miss
M. J. Maylorn, Miss M. Simon, Miss C. M. Pal
mer, Miss K. E. Whittaker, Miss K. Shepherd,
Miss J. M. Stewart, Mrs. F. Osborne.
In Berkeleyâ Mrs. K. Thompson, Mrs. A. M.
Brown, Miss H. E. Whirlow, Mrs. M. E. Hay.
burn.
In Alamedaâ Mrs. G. D. Mitchell, Miss A. F.
Sprague, Miss M. E. Hopps.
In East Oaklandâ Mrs. M. A. Hoggs, Miss E.
Fontin.
Your committee believes San Francisco ca
pable of supplying teachers from her owu
community and recommena that teach- fs
non-resident be dropped from the roll. Re
spectlully submitted,
L. S. Kast (Chairman).
B. B. KITTRIDGK.
J. W. CUDWORTH.
Chairman Brunt of tha committee ap
pointed to report upon the Fish and
Game Warden recommended the continu
ance of that official in office â that is to
say, recommended the continuauce of the
office, "as the City and County is insuffi
ciently patrolled by the officers of the
State Fish and Game Commission."
No action was taken on either report.
The Grand Jury will take up at its next
meeting the inquiry into the alleged at
tempt to bribe Supervisor Dodge by Frank
Marty in the Litter's effort to secure the
contract to supply the Almshouse and
City and County Hospital with milk.
Lecture on Hygiene.
This evening a lecture will be given
at the Mechanics' Institute by Lieutenant-
Colonel Greenleaf, United States army, on
"School Hygiene " The lecture will be free to
members of the Mechanics' Institute and their
friends, and in addition, as this is a matter of
importance to educators, schoolteachers and
all parties Interested in the subject are espe
cially invited to be present.

The Brig John D. Spreckels Passing; Up the Bay With the First Cargo of the New Sugar Crop Aboard. She Made the Ron in
Fourteen and a Half Days, Which Is Quick Time for This Time of the Year. In the Distance Can Be Seen the

Record.
Thursday Night's Storm D.d Lttle
Damage, but Caused Cmsid?r
cb!e Anxiety.
The brig John D. Spreckels made the
quickest run of the season so far from
Hawaii to San Francisco. She brought a
cargo of sugar for the refinery, and as the
wind was fair Captain Christensen took no
chances but sailed in through the Golden
Gate ana took his vessel up the bay
"under a wrap," but nevertheless at a
speed that was fast enough to distance the
Custom-house and quarantine boats and
also the tugboats. Off the Oregon dock
Captain Christensen took in sail and the
tug Alert caught the brig and towed her to
the refinery.
While the J. D. Spreckels was sailing up
the bay the Piper, Aden, Goodali com
pany's stern-wheel steamer Hope was
drifting toward Angel Island, while the
tug Millie was full speed in pursuit of her.
The Hope stopped to pick up a Whitehall
boat that was adrift, and while waiting
for the crew to get the craft aboard a log
drifted in between the rudder and the
paddle-wheeL When the signal to go
ahead was given the paddle-wheel of
course forced the log against the rudder
and then there was trouble. The rudder
was damaged to such an extent that the
captain lost all control of the vessel. He
let her swing until she was head on and
then he kept her going at half speed until
the tng came along and towed her in.
The Spreckels making twelve knots an
hour up the. bay and the steamer doing
her best to stem the tide until assistance
came made the only interesting scene
witnessed on the bay yesterday.
The following notices to mariners have
been issued by the branch hydrographic
office:
Washington; Columbia River, Martin Island
âAdditional light: A fixed while lantern
light, kuowu as Martin Is. and lower post light,
nas been established to mark the turn in the
ship channel at the foot oi Martin Island, Co
lumbia River. The light is suspended from an
arm on aeingle black pile in four feet of
water and Is twenty-eight feet above low water
mark.
British Columbia; Vancouver Island, South
coastâ Foul grouud inside Seabird Islet: The
lightkeeper at Carmanah reports that there is
no safe passage between Seabird Islet and the
eastern shore of Pachena Bay, about fifteen
miles westwa-d of Carmanah, there being sev
eral uncharted locks in the interval.
A vessel wishing to enter Pachena Bay
should, therefore, pass westward ot the outer
reef and Seabird Islet. Tnere are twelve fath
oms of water 200 yards outside the rocks of the
outer reef off Seabird Islet.
British Columbia, Vancouver Island, reef
oft Bonilla Point, amended position of Car
manah lighthouseâ J. T. Waloran, master of
the Dominion steamer Quadra, reports having
sounded the reef ofl Uonilla Point, .south
coast of Vancouver Island. He found sixteen
feet of water nearly half a mile from shore
about one mile east from the point, with four
fathoms at an equal distance from shore oppo-
Fite V.-.v point. Outside this reef the water
deepens rapidly.
Vessels should give Bonilla Point a berth of
one mile.
Carmanah lighthouse stands on the most
souther! v projection of the point, about a
quarter of a mile south, 68 degrees west true
(southwest mag.) from the Indian village, in
(approximately! latitude 48 degrees 36
minutes 32 seconds north, longitude 124
degrees 46 minutes 10 seconds west.
Vessels now in port and ships to arrive
will not await September wheat and the
possible chance of a 30-sii ii lin j: rate to
Europe. The Damanthu will come out of
Oakland Creek to-day and from here will
zo to Honolulu in ballast to load sugar for
New York. The Babcock, which got in
last Thursday, will begin discharging her
cargo at Howard-street wharf to-day and
will then take in ballast for a run to Hono
lulu, where she also will load sugar for
New York. This makes at least half a
dozen vessels that have gone from this
port to load sugar at Hawaii for the
American metropolis.
The steam-schooner Whitesboro reports
the sealing-schooner J. Eppinger with 221
skins. The two vessels met off Point San
Pedro and the captain of the sealer asked
to be reported as "all well."
There were several narrow escapes dur
ing Thursday night' 3 storm. The Eva
went adriit, and her anchorÃ only held
when she was in striking distance of the
F.intshire. The Anglesey also dragged,
but her captain put out an extra anchor
and she weathered the gale without any
more trouble. At Folsom-street wharf

helped matters out. The float broke adriit

things hum at the end of the wharf. Cap
tains "Clem" Randall and "Gil" Brockaw
were on watch all night, and on several
occasions It looked as if there would be
work for a tug.
The bark Colusa was taken from the
drydock to Little Main street during the
afternoon, and she got the full force of the
gale. Flying light the wind and under
tow put a terrible strain on her mooring
lines. Three of the hawsers parted, one
after another, and the vessel was in dan
ger of running amuck, when a steel haw
ser held and the Colusa was finally made
tight to the wharf again. While the gale
was not a very heavy one the swell from
the ocean was unusual, and it was due to
the latter that vesselg strained at their
moorings, and tugs, boats and other craft
had to get out extra lines.

MURDOCH'S ALIMONY.
Objects to Paying Half His Sal
ary to His Divorced
Wife.
Says Her Coaduct Ought to Re i va
Him From This Extra Finan
cial Burden.
The old divorce case of Nannie Murdoch
against William C. Murdoch came up in a
vexatious form in Judge Slack's court
yesterday. It was an application by Mur
doch for custody of the minor son of tho
parties to the action, and for relief from
the order of court which compels him to
pay $125 a month alimony.
In order to establish the justice of his
application Mr. Murdoch offered to prove
that Mrs. Murdoch is not a proper person
to have tbe custody of the child, and that
her life is of such a character as woulu
entitle him to be relieved from the obliga
tion to pay her alimony. This preseniÃ a
case never before considered by a court in
California.
Mr. and Mrs. Murdoch were married in
Sutler County, tbia State, In 1881, and
soon afterward removed to this City,
where they still live. He is employed by
a prominent financial institution at a
salary of $200 a month. The divorce was
granted to Mrs. Murdoch in this City on
the 25th of February, 1895, on the ground
of crueity, since which time he lias been
paying more tliau half his salary to her.
Attorneys James Alva W;itt and \V. C.
Cross, representing Mrs. Murdoch, inter
posed a legal objection to the application
for the stoppage of the alimony. They
denied tnat their client, had been guilty of
any improper acts, yet they contended
that even if this allegation "were true it
would not be a good reason for a discon
tinuance of the alimony payments.
In support of this position the gentle
men cited the case of Forrest againt For
rest. Mrs. Forrest secured a divorce from
the eminent actor for some delinquency,
and was accorded an order for alimony.
Subsequently Forrest appeared and of
fered to prove that Mrs. Forrest had not
been living according to society's rule?.
The highest courts to which this case
could be taken decided that this was not
sufficient cause for relieving Forrest from
paying alimony.
Chickerine, Thomas & Gregory, appearing
for Mr. Murdoch, argued that the facts
Hint the law in this case are not identical
with the circumstances covered by the
Mew \orJc case, and insisted that their
client ought to be relieved from his bur
den.
Judge Slack promised to give a decision
on Monday. If the decision goes against
Mrs. Murdoch Jshe will make a contest on
the alleged facts of the case.

THE AUDITOR'S
ANSWER TO HYDE
Broderick Repels the Ex-
School Director's Charges
Against Him. .
He Says Hts Accuser Is a Poli
tician Who Does Not Know
the Facts
School Dirrc'or Waller Charges That
the Ex-Director's Figures Are
Wrong and Misleading.
The controversy set in motion by Attor
ney F. A. Hyde, ex-president of two
former school boards, bids fair to result in
a thorough Grand Jury investigation of
matters pertaining to the Schocfl Depart
ment.
Mr. Hyde attacks the present board and
its predecessor with accosationsof extrav
agance, nepotism and violation of the
law. He plainly states that the Board of
Education is a band of political plunder
ers and says, furthermore:
"I thrown down the gauntlet and chal
lenge them to deny my accusation. They
may call me a crank, and such men as
O'Connor may issue circulars against me,
but I care not for pamphleteers if,they can
not combat my facts."
There is one among the accused who has
decided to come back at ex-Director Hyde
and fight him with his own weapons, and
that man is Auditor Broderick, who has
been charged with gross violation of the
law. He first said he did not care to enter
the lists ds a combatant, but. became rest
less under tire and consented to notice
Mr. Hyde's charges. To a Call reporter
he said yesterday:
I dislike to enter into what might seem a
discussion about my acts as a public official
with/ those who are not in a public position
and with whom I Have no public dealing. Of
course I do not mean by this that I object 10
giving the utmost satisfaction to any citizen,
no matter who be may be, if ho desires to
understand the reason of any public act of
mine.
The discussion between Mr. Waller and Mr.
Hawley might have been confined to them,
but you insisted upon my figures as to the con
ditionof the school fund, and now you are
asking me what I have to say as to what Mr.
Hyde says about me and my figures. One of
the most notable things in San Francisco
political affairs is shown in this request of
yours. It is to be regretted that the press of
Ban Francisco is so open, but perhaps it an
swers a good purpose.
Mr. Hyde at one time had a good deal to say
in school matters, but he is not so situated
now as to be able to have a voice. To me it
sometimes seems that when sensations are not
at hand those who hold public office must
allow themselves to be made subjects for sen
sational comment. Mr. Hyde's interview, to
which you call my attention, and on which
i you request my views, has many things in it
that are correct; but it has much in it calcu
lated to mislead. It should be borne in mind
that we have not heard of Mr. Hyde in public
school matters for somu time, and I think he
gets into a suspicious position when he at
tempts to knock the heads of Hawley, Waller
Hu<i myself together, as he does in the first
parwjrnph. Mr. Hyde is wrong in saying that
the $200,000 is set aside as a separate fund.
It is but a segregation or part of a fund set
aside for a specir>c purpose and must of ne
cessity bo applied to that purpose if needed.
The Board oi Supervisors has law enough for
doing this In the ordinance passed by them as
to appropriations and their uses. They have
ordered and published an allowance of $1,
--000,000 for school purposes and $200,000 lor
t.ie Mission High School. That 1b law enough
for an honest Board oi Education and an Audi
tor that will act under its spirit.
In the second paragraph of the interview in
The Call Mr. Hyde is rightabout the teach
ers' salary or half-salary retained, but he is
sadly wrong in all else he says about the de
mands I held out Irom parties this month, be
cause of the overdraft of $18,000 that was
caused by the auditing of the teacherb' De
cember salaries in full. Mr. Hyde does not
view the question from the right standpoint.
He is an ex-School Director, not the Auditor,
and therefore is under no responsibility that
might call for his spectacles.
The reference in the third paragraph to the
last board is a little severe, but perhaps he is
right He says: "The Auditor must know, for
he has been in office long enough to know,
that be hai no right to withhold tne payment
of any bills approved by the Board oi Educa
tion, provided the one-tweifth act Is not vio
lated/ Of course I have been Auditor for
some time without any assistance from Mr.
Hyde or politicians of his class, and he speaks
from personal experience on this subject, for
he tested my powers on bills allowed by the
Board of Education very fully when he was
president. I successfully refused to ittdlt sev
eral, however, to his displeasure and vexation,
and my action was sustained by law and
court decisions.
The teachers, I think, can collect their back
salaries if they place themselves on record
right; but they must take no chances on the
advice of enthusiasts. I beg leave to differ
from Mr. Hyde in his placing contractors and
others wno may have claims against the
school fund, based upon the discretion or or
ders of members of the board, in tho posl'ion
teachers hold. If such parties find themselves
tangled up in the meshes of the constitution
and one-twelfth act the result will not be
pleasant. It is not long since a Board of
Supervisors made contracts and ordered ma
terial, supplies and labor equal to about nine
] twelfths of a fiscal year appropriation before
they retired from office and San Francisco has
ever since been scandalized all over the world
as "bad pay."
If those Supervisors had been a little more
careful to respect their pledges and their oaths
of office, and if they had confined their action
to the requirements of their terms of office, it
would have been far better for many good
people who now hold claims and demands
allowed by said Board of Supervisors. They
are not worth the paper on which they are
printed. Had they placed the responsibility
where it belongs (on the board instead of on
the City) they might have received something.
The retiring Board of Education has been
guilty of a like indiscretion, and this has
caused the trouble that brings Mr. Hyde from
his seclusion.
The reference to the Board of Supervisors'
appropriation of $200,000 for a High School
is rather hazy. It implies that if the Board
of Education saw fit to use it for something
else there is no law against it, and if they did
use It for other purposes they need not build;a
High School. Of course not. Howcould they?
That would te a downright dishonest trick
upon lhe taxpayer, however, if it were pos
sible to use the money for its appropriate pur
pose.
In the case at issue the situation is all sup
posed to be settled. The lot has been bought,
tliougli somewhat larger than needed. Con
tracts have been entered into and bonds given
for the constructionof the school building, at
a cost equal to the amount appropriated. If
these contracts be valid and legally made it
would be the sheerest nonsense to include the
$200,000 thus appropriated and pledged In
the estimate made of the amount of money
availing under the one-twelfth act. I there
fore do not include it in any calculations as to
supplies, salaries, etc. It does not fit there.
The contracts were made by the retiring
board.
If money be not retained or transferred
from other funds and carried over into the
next fiscal year to meet these contract obliga
tions when the work is completed, the con
tractors will be losers to the amount of deficit,
aud no levy of tax can be made for the pur
pose of paying them. The constitution, the
one-twelfth act and supreme decisions make
that dead sure and certain.
School Director Waller said yesterday in
reference to the averments of ex-School
Director Hyde:
We are compelled by the law to appoint
some one to watch and superintend the work
uuon the Mission High School. Tnat is pro
vided for by the 'Act to regulate the erection
>of public buildings and structures.' That act
sets up that the Board of .Education must ap
point some one to superintend to see that the
plans and specifications are carried out.
School Director Hyde does not seemingly
understand this matter, and is equally at loss I
upon several other propositions. The archi
tect has only to see that the architectural
plans are carried out. He is not required to
put in all his time wnile the building is under
construction to watch the materials used and
so on. But some one must do that. The work
of building has begun.' Therefore. Mr. Hyde
is ftgnin mistaken in saying that there is noth
ing â to inspect. The grading has been done
and the materials for the foundation are
on the site of the building. The original reso
lution provided for a salary of $250, but we
cut down the price to $200. The old board
contracted for the work. We want only to see
that it is done right.
Mr. Hyde does not take account of the regular
increase in salaries paid teachers after they
have served ten years. This increase amounts
to $6000 or $7000. I have introduced resolu
tions in the board that have been sidetracked,
but if they were adopted, they would mean a
saving to the department of $32,148 before
the first day ot next July.
1 have a resolution before the board to ap
portion the balance of the fund for the fiscal
year, so that a saving of $21,000 can be
made in six months' . time. The figures
will show this to be so by comparison with the
apportinment of the old board. Here is my
apportionment In a nutshell, for the six
months' allowance;
Committees- b2si . P B < ( f-nt
Finance..... $12,000 $6,000
Buildings and grounds 9,000 3.000
fcnppiles..... 12.000 â¢ 3,000
Printing.. 1,500 600
Items..... . 900 750
Hooks for indigent children... . 9UU 600
This has bet n sidetracked, but I snail call
the matter up again. Dispensing with several
teachers would hayÂ« saved $1150 per month
or $6900 in six months. That has also been
sidetracked. The board would not face the
issue. Tnen the proposition to do away with
fifteen substitute teachers, to save $600 per
month, has Also been knocked out.
The sum of $048 has also been saved by the
refusal of the Finance Committee of the board
to audit the bill. .-;â  â¢--.';
ENDED THEIE OtfN LIVES.
Coroner Tlrtwkius H-ept Busy Holding
Inquest* in Suicide Cases.
Coroner Hawkins held several inquests
yesterday, most of which were cases where
the subjects had taken upon themselves
the responsibility of ending their own
lives.
Mary Thiery of 828 Howard street ended
her life on the 24th inst. by the use of a
revolver. A verdict of suicide was re
turned.
A verdict of suicide was given in the
case of H. H. Griesbach, who lived at the
Cosmopolitan Hotel on Fifth street. De
ceased was a native of Germany, 50 years
of age and a solicitor by occupation. On
January 23 be was found on Stanford
Heights, near the Corbett road, with a
bullet- ho)e in his head. His revolver ly
ing near at hand told the tale.
On January 22 Richard Binder, a native
of Germany, 44 years of age, living at 221
Lexington avenue, went to 624 California
street and turned on the gas. Suicide
was the judgment of the jury.
The evidence In the cases of William L.
Blake and William J. Buckley, the paint
ers who were killed by falling from a
building on Stevenson street near Third,
caused the jury to believe that their
deaths were accidental and due to their
own carelessness. Blake lived at 19a Har
rison avenue and Buckley at 1307 Broad
way, Oakland. Both had families.
On tne 26th inÂ«t. the body of Abigail E.
Perrine of 1212 West street, Oakland, was
recovered from the foot of Clay street,
San Francisco. A verdict of suicide
caused by despondency was rendered.
Suicide was the verdict given in the case
ot Robert 8. Harris, the student who blew
his brains out with a revolver oh the 22d
inst. He lived at 324 O'Farrell street.
SUNG THE PRAISES
OF ROBBIE BURNS
St. Andrew's Society Mem
bers Indorse the Monu
ment Plan.
An Enthusiastic Gathering in
Honor of Scotland's Noble
Poet.
His Memory Lives Again in Prose
and Music on His Birthday
Anniversary.
The one hundred and thirty - eighth
anniversary ol the birth of Robert
Burns was celebrated last evening by
the members of the St. Andrew's So
ciety and their friends with literary and
musical exercis-es as well as a dance.
In his introductory address President
Andrew Wilkie spoke of the cosmopolitan
nature of the assemblage, and he hailed
this fact with delight that while the
Scotchmen were aot less in number in the
society's gatherings, still, the attendance
was not distinctively Scotch.
In alluding to tne proposed monument
to Robert Burns for Golden Gate Park,
President Wilkie outlined the attitude of
the St. Andrew's Society.
"It is purely a benevolent society," he
said, "and funds cannot be diverted for
any other purpose.
"Individually, I dare say that we are all
in accord with the worthy object. As a
matter of fact, most of the prominent
members of our society are also members
of the Caledonian Club, which organiza
tion is assisting the good cause along. It
can therefore be understood that if we are
not in the movement as a body we cer
tainly are in it heart and soul as individ
uals."
Robert B. Scott delivered an address on
Robert Burns, excerpts of which were as
follows: "It is now 138 years ago since
the wife of a Scottish peasant was made
happy by the birth of her first born, with
clouds of glory, of inspiration and of po
etry circling his head, and wno was des
tined thereafter to be known to his coun
try and to the whole world as Robert
Burns, one of the few immortal names
that was not born to die.
"Shortly before Burns' death he said to
his wife: 'I'll be more respected lOOyears
aiter my death than lam today.' Burns'
prophecy has been realized more than he
himself or his warmest admirers ever an
ticipated. His fame has gone beyond his
own country and become universal. His
songs are quoted from the pulpit and the
forum.
"Monuments of enduring granite and
bronze have been erected to his memory
in his own land, in P^ngiand and in Amer
ica, Australia and New Zealand, and it
should not be long before a monument is
raised in Golden Gate Park to the plow
man poet, one that will be a fitting trib
ute to his memory and an embplli-hment
and honor to the great city by the sea.
"Burns, with his noble and independent
spirit, was tru!y one of earth's chosan
heroes, who stood alone for humanity and
for righteousness. As he said himself he
was no saint and he had a whole lot of
foibles and sins to answer for. 'But if I
could,' be said, 'and 1 believe I do as far
as I can, I would wipe all tears from all
eyes.'
"We are thankful," added the speaker,
"that he was no saint, though he was one

THE WORLD OF SPORT.
News That Will Interest Fighters, Wheelmen,
Coursers, Baseball Players and
Sportsmen.
Corbett and Fltzsimmons can give no
reasonable excuse now for avoiding a tilt
with nature's weapons. The Governor of
Nevada State has signed the bill which
passed both houses of the Nevada Legisla
ture, Manager Stuart has deposited the
coin and the only thing that will prevent
the championship contest from being de
cided on March 17 is sickness of either
principal. But, in case either one is really
sick and unable to give a good account of
himself on tae day set for the battle, a
postponement can be had until such time
as the men are physically able to right.
The wet weather has spoiled the sport of
the wheelmen, the hunters and the
anglers.
Coursing is, however, in full blast. So
are baseball and rifle-sbootiug. In fact all
lines of sport nave a healthy appearance.
THE WHEELMEN.
Club Entertainments and Parties.
Another Velodrome Saturday
Afternoon Meet,
The rast week has been very quiet in
cycling circles. The inclement weather
baa prevented the carrying out of several
proposed runs scheduled for to-morrow,
and there are no race meets or other at
tractions in the very near future. Indoor
club life will serve to pass the time for the
organized wheelmen, and card parties,
dances, entertainments and the like are
being arranged to keep up the interest iv
the clubs.
The Velodrome will venture another
Saturday afternoon meet on February 13,
the programme for which as so far ar
ranged will include two amateur events,
Fcratch at. two-thirds and five miles, and
a tire-mile scratch professional race; also
t tie shield race, between D. E. Whitman
and C. E. Dow.
The annual 25-mile road race of the
California Associated Clubs will be held
on Washington's birthday, February 22,
over the San Leandro triangle. It will be
started at 9 a. m. Already a large number
of men are in training for the event. The
Acme Club of Oakland will pin in prob
ably twenty men, and the Bay City
Wheelmen, Olympics, Californias and
Imperials almost as many each. It is one
of the classic road events of the year,
wherein valuable prizes for time and
place are given, and judicious handi
capping has always made it possible for a
good middle-mark or limit man to win
first place. Hence the interest all the
riders take in it. The distance is long,
and very early training is necessary.
Probably every man who expects to start
has commenced his preliminary training
ere this.
Owen Kimball, Earl H. Kisor and Tom
Cooper are expected here before long, a3
they are announced to come to California
to train for the 1897 national circuit di
rectly after the Chicago cycle show, which
closes to-nicrbt. Kiser and Cooper are
known to us, but Kimball is a new one.
They will be a creditable addition to the
long libt of professional racers now on the
coast.
The programme proposed to be given
lor the two weeks' indoor tournament in
March is as follows: The rim six days
there will be a six-day race, running
five hours from 1 to 6 p. m. and
three hours from 7 to 10 p. m., imme
diately alter which there will be a
short distance race, either amateur or
professional: The second week there will
be short and middle distance races each
evening, with such-features as a rive-mile,
ten-mile, one hour and twenty-lour hour
race.
The North California Division will not
be monetarily able to send more than two
delegates in person to the annual conven
tion of the League of American Wheel
men at Albany next month. They will bÂ»
Frank H. Kerripan, chief consul, and R.
M. Welch, member National racing board.
They will take the proxies of the other
five delegates and will work hard for
divisional option on Sunday racing, good
roads, admission and licensing of profes
sionals, and other important objects. It
is to be regretted that the division's funds
will not permit of more delegates being
sent, as the attainment of the endsdesired
is in peril unless the two gentlemen named
succeed in enlisting hearty support from
the Eastern delegates, had some of the
dealers "stood in" more liberally and
helped the league meet last Saturday, it
might have been possible to send Mr.
Bmytn, the handicapper, Mr. Alexander
of Han Jose, or some other equally cheer
ful worker for the cause. However, ver
bum sap.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
will hold Us regular bi-monthly meetin
next Satpraay evening at the rooms of
the Acme Club Wheelmen, Oakland.
Popular "Brick" Kuhn is back from his
Eastern trip and is now with the Crescent
peopre.
H. A. Goddard of the Bay City Wheel
men is at the Chicago cycle show and
will attend the New York show also. He
expects to be back in California in March,
and in a letter to me he prays for the
early coming of the day. saying that the
frigid Eastern climate has no charms
for him.
The Garden City Cyclers held their
mucb-talked-of minstrel entertainment at
San Jose last evening. The parts were
nearly all taken by local talent there, and
by hara work and constant rehearsals
they prepared an ex.eilent performance.
Tne club is not dead by any means,
though many would have it so.
Captain Henry L. Day has called for the
third time a run of the Bay City Wheel
men to laundry Farm, and as usual it
has rained torrents a day or two before
the event. The run is off now until some
future date, ami wnen it is announced it
will probably be as pood as the signal ser
vice in predicting an approaching storm.
Victor A. Hancock of the membership
committee 01 the North California Di
sion, L. A. W., has gone to Sail Jose to
try and get some new members ant* to in
terest the expiring Garden Oiiys to re
new, "Vie" is quite popular down there,
in fact everywhere, and should be very
successful.
The Alameda Cyclers held an entertain
ment at the Linderman Opera-house last
evening, which was weil atteuded and
very enjoyable. The proceeds will be ex
pended in training and preparing a team
of ten racers to represent the club in the
annual relay race in April.
Commencing this evening the Bay City
Wheelmen's cribbage tournament starts
in and will probably last a fortnight.
Nineteen bad entered up to last nighi. ia
clnding the following well-known devotees
of the game: Harry Larkin, Â£. S. Battle?
Fred L. Day, Jacob M. Pike, Fred Boeck

A. J. Manne. TLis number will probably
be doubled by tne time the entries close
to-night. Valuable prizes will be offered
by the club for the three best scores made.
The Imperial Cycling is going to
be active during the approaching season,
and already Captain Troillet and the di
rectors have arranged a series of indoor
OTTO ZIEGLER.
and outdoor amusements for the mem
bers. There will be a whist tournament
commencing next Wednesday evening;
Sunday, February 7, a club run to the
Velodrome and two club races there, a
mile h?n ticap and half mile scratch, no
entry fee, no prizes, hence permissible on
Sunday under L. A. W. rules. Alter the
races the run will continue to Trocadero
lor lunch. The club's first road race for
the year is scheduled for Sunday, Febru
ary 28, and will be a ten-mile event over
thi Hay wards course. There will be two
ten-mile try-outs over the Haywards
course March 7 aud 21. and all candidates
tor the club's relay team must ride in
these. Bert Petne, formerly of the Olym
pic Club, has been engaged to train the
racer*. W. L. Maule, vice-president, has
resigned, and an election to fill the va
cancy will be held at tne regular mem
bers' meeting next Monday evening.
Chief Consul Kerrigan entertained a
jolly party at dinner aftfr the races last
Saturday. His guests were R. M. Welch
of the National racing board; R. A.
Smytn, official handicapper; Dave E.
Shafer, the well-known trainer; Fred J.
Longhead, the Canadian champion* C. N.
Ravlin of the Olympic; Charles 8. Wells
and "Bob" Terrill, the popular local pro
fessionals, and the writer. After dinner
they visited the Orpheum and altogether
passed a very pleasant evening, particu
larly the Judge himself, who never shows
to better advantage than when he is act-
Ing as host.
Trainer Shafer Is talking about giving a
big meet ai the Garden City Cyclers' track
in San Jose on February 22 or thereabouts
providing be does not take his team to the
New Orleans meet. Shafer would attract
all the cracks to his meet by reason of the
liberality of his prizes, and as he proposes
to match Ziegler and McFarland at a mile,
and Wells and Becker at five miles, there
would bo no question about drawing an
immense crowd. And, although it is a
long way off, I think that right now lean
call the winner oi each event â Ziegier and
Wells. Becker will give Wells a ride for
his money, but I don't think the other
two should ever be matched, there is such a
disparity in their ability in favor of Zieg
ler. He outclasses McFarland completely.
The Canadian champion, Longhead, I
pick to head the list of "pros" on the
coast as soon as he enters competition.
The wonderml speed he showed at the
Velodrome last Saturday, without any
training whatever, is a forerunner of what
ho will do after a month's training under
Shafer, and his National circuit reputa
tion tells us he will prove a better man
than any one else here just at present.
Loughead has become very popular with
t nose he has come in contact with here,
more so than any other Eastern cycle visi
tor I know of, all of which will be a help
to him.
Sydney B. Vincent of the Baj City
Wheelmen rode five miles at tnÂ« Velo
drome last Sunday, paced by a tandem, in
about 10:32, which is much better than
Becker's professional record, which,
though made in competition, was paced,
and amounted to practically the same kind
of a ride. Vincent will be a prominent
factor in amateur events this year it' he
combines more head work with his speed.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1897.
The Piute Baseball Team That Will Show Its Skill at Central Park To-Morrow.
in the light and brisk atmosphere of the
hich altitude of Nevada State, the heavy
weight championship of the world will be
deeded in a battle that will assuredly be
witnessed by thousands of the sport-lov
ine people of America.
If a line can be drawn from the very
latest expressions of the two aspirants to
the title oi champion, the only conclusion
tbat can be arrived at is that Jim and Bob
are really more anxious for the fray than
Manager Dave Smart, the man who has
so adroitly and so successfully engineered
the schema which has astonished the
sporting world.
Few if any people outside those who
were so deeply interested in the proposed,
battle royal had the remotest idea a few
weeks ago that the representatives of the
Nevada Legislature would favor a propo
sition of holding a prize-light between
two of the most noted exponents of the
manly art on Nevada's soil. Bui tbe un
expected occasionally happens, and the
State of Nevaua has now the proud dis
tinction, that is from a sport'ng stand
point, ot being in a position to offer Mana
ger Stuart an opportunity of carrying out
his pet scheme without the least fear of
intenerence from the authorities of the
sagebrush State.
Corbett stated yesterday that he will
leave for this City immediately, and that
afier a short visit to his reiativÂ«s he will
aepsirt for Carson, with the intention ol
locating a training station. Champion
Jim is aware ot the fact that to become
acclimated to the light atmosphere of the
mountains he must not tarry on the way,
and he has made no mistake in so ttimk-
ing.
Jim will find, when he starts in to take
a morning spin over roads that are made
beautiful by a carpet of snow, that his
breathing apparatus wiil be taxed. His
customary mile joes in tbe lower altitudes
will be decreased to a surprising extent.
In fact, if James can* bo a quarter without
stopping to catch a very fresh breeze he
can justly lay claim to being the possessor
of high-ioned lun^s. It can be saiely said,
however, that the man whoÂ«e pulmonary
organs are in the best order will score a
big advantage in Nevada's climate.
Fiizsicumons is already packing up his
traps preparatory to a journey in the
direction of tbe setting sun. He may pos
sibly be at his post before his opponent
has completed his arrangements. The
people of Nevada will give the famous
men of muscuiar power and science a
royal welcome, and it goes without sayine
that nothing will be left undone by the
sporting fraternity of the mountains to
make pleasant the stay of the two fistic
gladiator? during their sojourn in the
land of untold wealth.
Rich men of sporting proclivities from
divers parts of the country will visit the
once famous mining region for a dual pur
pose, viz. : 10 witness the great tight be
tween the kings of pugilism and to see the
husky miners working underneath the
ground.
A dispatch which was received from
Corbett yesterday stated (hat his trainer
will be Billy Deianey of Oakland, and a
better man for the office the champion
cannot find among the Handlers 01 light
ing men. It is hard to say who wiii be
the. favorite in the betting. In the far
West Corbett will sell on the long end.
He will also have numerous supporters in
New York Staie, while Fiizsimmons will
be heavily backed by the sports ol New
Orieana. who iiave t c utmost confidence
in his ability to whip Corbett in short
order. It will be remembered that while
Fitzsimmons was training for his fight
with Sbarkey he was somewhat annoyed
by a small hacking cough, which some of
his most intimate friends state has re
mained with him since the time he con
tracted a cold just previous to his depart
ure for England, but Fitz pays little or no
attention to such trifling things.
Assembly bill No. 8, which passed both
houses of the Nevada Legislature and
which was signed yesterday by Governor
Sadler, reads as follows:
An act to restrict and license glove contests
or exhibitions between man and man, acid
to repeal all other acts in conflict therewith.

a challenge to ficht Tom Sharkev, the
sailor pugilist, a glove contest of ten
rounds for a purse and a side bet of from
$1000 to $2000 a side. Sharkey will, of
course, like all of the awkward squad tell
Jeffries to gain a reputation first. What
bosh !
John L. Sullivan who was the greatest
fighter of them all in his day, was granted
a continuance by Judge Ely in the Poor
Debtors' Session of the municipal court
of Boston, Mass., on January 20. The
famous ex-champion claims that he is un
able to meet his debts and seeks release
â from such by law. He has taken the poor
debtors' oath. Sporting men will be in
terested to read the following schedule of

Amendments to the Fish Laws That
.Will Not Please Local Anglers.
The beautiful rain has placed a damper
on steel head -h-hing. The streams and
nver3 which discharge their contents into
the ocean are now running bank full, so to
say, and as a consequence the parent
fishes of the trout which are taken during
the summer months are speeding in the
direction of their spawning beds.
It can be safely said that there will not
be any fishing worthy of note in tide
waters until ti.e weather as-umes a set
tled condition and the water clears of its
refuse matter. Judging by the past 9ea .
sons' catchea the best sport enjoyed by
mid-winter anglers is during the months
of February and March, therefore there
can De no just reason why members of a
fraternity who delight in the capture 01
large and guÂ«ae lisues should feel discour
aged because of the present unfavorable
conditions for the enjoyment of a favorite
pastime.
According to a report of the Fish Com
mission concerning measures which have
passed the AssemD.y and which appeared
in yesterday's paper the anglers of this
City have received a stunning blow. But
there is yet time in which to act before
some of the obnoxious amendments to the
fish laws will be introduced into the Sen
ate, and doubtless all anglers who are in
tarested in the pastime of irout-catcbing
will instruct their influential fr.ends to in
tercede with the Senators with the object
of killing certain measures.
One of the amendments reads that the
open season for catching trout with hook
and line will commence on May 1, instead
of April 1, as the Jaw is at present, and
close on December 1, instead of Novem
ber 1.
Such an amendment to the fish laws will
cut off the best month of the year, whicii
is April, to local anglers, as the residents
who are wiihin easy access ol trout
streams will clean out every fish of re
spectable size before the local iraternity
can lawfully wet a line.
Some people who imagine that by ex
tending the opening of the c ! ~sed season
one month trout will have an opportunity
to grow big and wax fat, are certainly
ignorant of the protection that the trout
receive during the closed season.
In fact the coast streams are not pro
tected at any season of the year, and for
this reason i.c law as it now reads should
remain unaltered. If, on the other hand,
paid deputies were appointed to patrol
the streams and protect the little fashes
from capture during the month of April,
then an amendment to the present law
prolonging the opening of tbe closed
season one month would be a good
measure.
If the alleged sportsmen who were in
strumental in the passage of the measure,
which will certainly be opposed by all de
votees of angling when it comes before
the Senate, had introduced a measure
making it a misdemeanor for any person
to have trout under rive inches in length
in bis possession at any time of the year
then there would be reason for anelers to
praise the passage of such an act, but the
change in t tie opening of the season from
April to May will not prove of the least
noon until such time as our streams will
receive Droper. protection.
The report of the Fish Commission also
reaas that the close season for steelheads
will be from February Ito May 1. It does
not make any reference to tidewater fish
ing with rod and line, and, as a conse
quence, anglers who Â£sh for steelheads in
these months must put up their rods un
til the opening of the trout-fishing season.
Oi course, if the anglers of this City will
not interest themselves in the passage of
fish laws they can only expect to receive
their ju3t deseris at the hands of some
people who meddle in matters with, which
they are totally unfamiliar.
As an evidence of the ignorance dis
played by those who are meddling wUh
the fish Jaw?, all that is necessary to as
certain their knowledge is to ask them
what is a steelliead.
Accoraing to Professor Starr Jordan of
Stanford University, who is the acknowl
edged authority of this country on ail
matters piscatorial, a steelbearf is a trout.
Then why make the close season for steel
heads from February 1 to May 1 when the
close season for trout commences, accord-
ing to the report of the commission, on
December 1 and ends on May 1?
If the close season for salmon shonld,
according tv the bill now before the Leg
islature, be from September 10 to Novem
ber 15, then the steelhead cannot be al
lied with the salmon. Therefore N the
question again arises, What is a steel
head ? Anglers, piease do not all answer
at once.
GUN AND DOG.
Brant Shooting in Tomales Bay Is
Now Very Good-Gams Laws.
The season for shooting duck and quail
will end on February 15. and in case a bill
which is now before the Legislature passes
the Senate the man who shoots game tor
market purposes will have the same lati
tude next season as the sportsman who
j shoots for Treasure solely.
The market shooter has as much right
to shoot game as the man who is a mem
ber of a preserve club and kills birds be-
cause of the sport of killing. The so-called
sportsman delights in being the possessor
of a big bag of birds on his r-turn home,
and it is a well-known fact that frequently
he will sit as still as a cat in a "blind"
when snooting ducks and wait until an
opportunity is offered .or a pot shot and
then blaze away.
A market hunter will have to gather in
the game he maims and Kill?, but the
sportsman has his attendant near at hand,
who retrieves the dead and woumiea.
With tho exception that the market
shooter frequently u*es a gun of larger
bore ti an tne law allows there is not a
very wide lifre of difference to draw
between the two, that is, so far as the
greed for same is concerned.
It is to be hopt-d that some of the sports
men who are interested in duck and snipe
snooting will frame a bill, the objects of
which will be to include the .English snipe
in the game law among other game birds
and the extension of the duck-shooting
season one month longer than it is at
present.
The English snipe is the gamest of
game birds, and it is a shame that be
cause the law does not protect them dur
ing the close season they qre ruthlessly
slaughtered by pot-hunters in the sum
mer months while they are caring for
their young. Why the duck reason
should be extended is because of the
late arrival of the canvasback, bluebill
and other varieties of aquatic game
which do not leave this coast for their
breeding-grounds before April or May.

A rare and fine specimen of Albino robin
(Turdus migratorius) was shot by J. G. Bliss
recently on the outskirts of Alamedii. It is a
male bird in white plumage, except just a
suspicion oi pink seemingly inclined to man
tle to the su-fuce of the breast. The bird was
first observpd by Mr. Bliss's boy, Jack, while
out hunting, who lost no time in reporting to
his father, when measures were immediately
instituted tor the capture of the rara avis.
This was effected by the use of but three and
a half grains of smokeless powder, propellin?
just a pinch (if No. 10 shot through a 32
â¢â¢auxiliary" barrel. It therefore goes without
saying that the plumage was not disturbed in
the least, but remained intact and without
blemish. The specimen is now in the hands
of Mr. Emerson, a scientist, for preservation.

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR MiMR. MILLS' GLAD
HAND TO MINERS
The Railroad Proclaims a
New System With Its
Mineral Lands.
Will Make Contracts With Pros
pectors and Abandon Cairns
to Mines.
A Novel Proclamation Quutly Madi
That the Rairoad Will Cherish
the Miner.
The Southern Pacific Company has
taken a new tack ihat will surprise and
probably Dlease the miners.
W. H. Mills, as Jand agent for the Cen
tral P-acific, has issued a proclamation
stating that hereafter miners wishing to
prospect on patented raiiroad lands can
do bo under contract; tliat the company
13 ready to relinquish all elaini to any
operated mine on railroad lands; that
hereafter ail railroad lands which may be
reasonably classified as mineral will be
held for the encouragement of mining.
and that the company's policy will be to
& encourage the discovery of minerals and
,* the development of mining enterprises.
This official announcement was not '
j made to the Miners' Association, which
nas been conducting the long, Dersister.t
and still pending fieht to have the remain
ing unpatented mineral lands within the
railroad grants in this State and Oregon
reserved as mineral lands. The announce
ment was made tnis week by inserting i:
as an advertisement in the Yreka Journal,
tne Marysviile Democrat and three or four
other papers in the northern part of me
State, and it had not yesterday come to
the attention of the leading mining men
in this City. The important portions of
Mr. Mills' official announcement are as
follows:
All occupants of agricultural land who are
using the lands of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company for agricultural purposes are re
quested to notify the land agent at Sac Fran
clsco of such occupancy aud cultivation.
All persons having a'u actual operated mine
upon any odd-numbered section of land within
the limits of the grant to the California aud
Oregon Railroad Company are requested to
notify the land agent of the existence and
operation of such mine. Ihe land actually
within the mining claim of any mine operated
will be relinquished If the laud is not patented,
and will be donated it the land is patented.
Persons wishing to prospect patented rail
road land will go well to notify the land
agent of such desire and they can enter into
contracts which will make the discovery of
mineral upon lands safe to prospectur. AH
lands which may reasonably be classified as
mineral will bo held for encouragement of
mining, aud mining operations will be given
the preference of occupancy and use, unless
such land possesses a value for the timber
growing thereon. In 6uch cases a timber
value only will De assessed against the land
held for i&3 encouragement of mining, o-r, if
patented, will be sold at the minimum oi
$1 25 per acre, reserving the timber right. In
the disposition of its land the Central Pacific
Railroad Company will pursue the policy of
encouraging the discovery oi minerals and
the prosecution of mining enterprises, and in
no case will its title obsrruct or discourage
such enterprise.
Mr. Mills was absent from his office yes
terday and nobouy else was authorized to
i enter into any further explanations. Many
will be interested in knowing in what
terms and under what sort of contract a
prospector may secure the right to pros
pect on patented railroad lands. It is not
known how many, if any, operated mines
the company may be asked to give a quit
claim deed to.
Mr. Miils has long protested that the
company was friendly to the mining in
dustry and wanted to encourage it, but
this is the first time that any definite
propositions of this sort have comn from
him. Meantime the company has steadily
received its patents from the General Land
Office in sopite of miners' protests.
Probably 1,500,000 acres of the railroad
lands yet unpatented are more. mineral
than agricultural, but when they are
transferred to the company as agricultural
lands and then sold the buyer owns its
gold if any be there and the prospector is
barred. This new move is thought likely
to be a weapon for use in defeating the
mineral lands bill in Congress, but in de-

fault of that it will give much satisfaction
â¢â o tbe miners, at least, until it is seen how
it works.
Tirey L. Ford, who is taking a leading
part in behalf of the mineral lands bills
said yesterday :
"If the company means what it Bays
and has definitely determined to carry
out such a policy, it oug'it to mean ihe
beginning of an era of pood feeling be
tween the miners and the railroad com
pany. Mr. Mills has -aid many times that
the company was friendly to the miners,
but has mver made such a flefinit â¢,
, square-toed proposition as that. It will
I please the miners if it la carried out in
I eood faith. Of course we will keep up
" the right for the mineral lands bill just
the same. Ido not know whether or not
the com pany is now fighting the bill, but
Ido know that it fought it last winter
â¢lon,' the same lines as did tbe Land
Office."

CHICAGO'S COLD SPELL.
No Wreck at cheyenne, Not a Passen
ger Hurt and Many Aboard I>id
Not Even Awaken. â 
J. F. Webber, a retired business man of
Ch.cago, arrived here yesterday. He came
on the alleged wrecked train, so disas
trously smasned at Cheyenne, as was re
ported in some of the dispatches. Mr.
Webber treated the report quite ironically.
"All there was about the smash-up," he
said, "was ttat there wasn't a smash-up.
Tne train was not telescoped and there
wa-< nobody on tLe train among the passen
gers whatever that was injured. A good
many of them aboard didn't even know
that anything at all had happened. All
that happened was this: At a siding near
Cheyenne, about midnight Tuesday night,
as our train was puling west it culliued
with thR rear car of a train going eastâ
the latter train had not ' got quite far
enough by. That car was jammed up
some, but nobody was hurt there. I heard
the hreman of the engine jumped and
burt his collar-bone. I couldn't learn defa
n:tely even whether that was so or not.
We had to wait twelve or fifteen hours for
another engine, and that delayed us in get
ting in." â 
Mr. Webber is accompanied by Mrs.
Webber. They intend spending the win
ter in California. They were here nine
years ago. He gives a pretty harrowing,
though brief, account of the ravages of the
cold weather in Chicago.
"It is remarkably cold there, he said,
"and there is a great deal of snow. The
thermometer lias been away down to 20
below zero. Business is very dull there
and times are Hard. There is a good deal
of suffering among the poor, an<i they
were planning ways when I left to try to
raise money to help them. It's a great
deal duller tnere now than it was last
summer. I was glad to get away, and I
won't co back till the cold weather is
over." _____
LIFE'S ALARMS ARE O'ER
Death of John L. Durkee, the
City's First and Oldest Fire
Marshal.
The End Not Unexpected as His Li
ness Had Been Held Dangerous
for Some Months Past.
John L. Durkee, San Francisco's first
and ol le3t F;re Marshal, passed over to
the silent majority yesterday morning.
He died at his home, 1710}^ Hyde street,
at 1:30 o'clock, nged 69 years and 6 months.
Mr. Dtirkee's deatn was not unexpected,
for he had been seriously ill for several
months. Old a^e and infirmities brought
about the end.
John L. Durkee came to California in
1849, as mate on the ship Balance, con
signed to Brooks, who afterward became
searcher of records. The ship was beached
on tue corner of Clartc and Front streets,
and on the remains of fier hull now rests
the Cogswell building.
In 1859 Mr. Durkee was well known as
a brave and fearless p liceman, but he
was of too peaceful a nature for the duties
of the office and 1862 found him Deputy
Superintendent o! Streets. In 1865 he be
came Fire Marshal and he so continued
until October 15, 1886, when he was retired
on a pension of $100 per month for the
rest or hia life. He was a writer of ability
and wrote several most interesting ar
ticles. As a member of the "Vigilantes"
he was quite prominent aud at one time
was arrested on a charge of piracy, but
was finaily acquitted.
Mr. Durkee was one of the most active
firemen of the Volunteer Fire Department;
wa9 prominently identified witn tbe Mon
umentais, which was organized by men
from Baltimore; was its foreman, and was
No. 1 of the Exempt Fire Company and its
president for a long time.
During the time he was Fire Marshal
thf>re was a good-natured contest between
him and Chief Scannell as to who should
be thrown out of his buggy the greater
number of limes. If one was injure i the
othÂ«r seemed to have the same poor lucfc
beiore long. Durtcee was one of the or
ganizers oi the Ea.'le Baseball Club, one
of the first, if not the tirs?, oreanized in
San Francisco. Judue Hunt wa3 an active
member of ihi3 ciub
Mr. Durkee was a man who was honored
ami respected by al. who knew him.
He leaves a widow and three children
two daughters and a son.

BURGLARS AT W ORK
ALL OVER THE CITY
The Silent Craftsmen Enter
J. H. Schmilz's Grocery
Store.
Scores of Pac s Have Been
Looted Within the Past
Few Days.
Thcmas McDonald Captured With
Most of His Pi under From a Ssccni-
Street Restaurant.
Another burglary has been reported to
the police. It is one of a score that are
taking place nightly in this City, which
seems to be the Mecca for the JBieves of
the entire State in the winter and rainy
season.
This time it is the grocery-store of J. H.
Schmitz, at 124, the southeast corner of
Taylor and Eddy streets.
The thieves waited until the proprietor
closed the place, at 1 o'clock in the morn
ing, yesterday, and they began work on
the immense snow-window facing on Tay
lor street and reaching around on Eddy.
With a diamond or other thing capable
of cutting through glass they opened up a
convenient circle in the center pane of
glass, and emptied the showcase oi nu
merous bottles of champagne, whisky and
beer. There were other bottles of liquors
and things in their way to an easy access
to the store, so they gathered them in as
well.
The thieves must have been Beared
away before they completed their job, but
the preparations they had made, as indi
cated by the other panes of glass that
were cut, show that they were well started
in their work before being interrupted.
Four days aeo burglars entered the
Allen home on Scott street, near Oak, and
looted the place. Two days ago they cap
lured the cashbox of Mueppenuer &
T. F. SANDERS, Owner of the New Bonanza and Bachelor Mines,
and H* HAMMOND, Proprietor of Extensive Mining;
Interests at Ouray*
[Sketched from life by a " Call" artist.]
Mueller, at Lott street and Golden Gate
avenue, and a score of other burglaries of
the kind have been reported to police
headquarters. The burglars are the new
comers, it appears, tnieves who are driven
into town by tne cold weather, and the
Police Department finds it difficult 10
locate them.
Yesterday. however, Officers T. L. Ryan
and E. ODea gathered in one Thomas
McDonald, a local resident, and booked
him at the City Prison on a charge of
burglary.
McDonald was a waiter at 18 Second
street until the 22d inst., when he was
discharged. On that night with a dupli
cate key of the place, made at his request
by a locksmith in the neighborhood, he
entered the place and gathered in all he
could find.
He carried away three boxes of cigars,
a bottle of black berry brandy, a pistol, a
streetcar conductor's cap and $5.
The officers found all these things ex
cepting the pistol in the prisoner's room.
The lodging-hoase at 501 Post street,
corner of Mason, seems to offer unusual
inducements to room-robbers. Room 49,
occupied by W. Robinson, a mining man
recently from Amador County, was en
tered on Thursday afternoon aud his
trunk was broken open and some small
trinkets were carried away.
Three weeks previous another roomer
had an unsolicited visitor enter his room

THE PACIFIC ROADS' DEBT.
H. E. Highton'a i etter to Congress
Calls Government Ownership
a Bugbear.
The followins letter from Henry E.
Hignton to ex-Mayor Sutro relating to
debts of the Pacific railroads has also
been submitted to members of Congress:
San Feakcisco, January 23, 1897.
My Dear Mr. Sutro: You aslt my opinion,
shortly, on the present condition of the in
debtedness oi the Central Pacific Eaiiroad
Company to the Government
I regard the situation as still critical, and
that now, above all times, none of our friends
in Congress snould take the back track. I
sincerely hope that Senator Morgan, for whom
I have a d? ep respect, has not been misled.
Congressional action of any kind would be
worse than useless, tor it would mean neither
more nor less than the condonation of un
paralleled frauds. The re-iunding bill has
been beaten, but v commission, if possible,
would bo worse. L commission means settle
ment. There is nothing to -ettle out of court.
Arbitration or compromise implies that there
are honest differences oi opinion or in rela
tion to facts to be adjusted.
In the case of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company therÂ« are no such differtnc â *, and
there are but two alternatives fur the Govern
mentâeither to (Oilect the debt in the usual
way or ratify fraud and accept what the rail
road may disgorge. I repeat what I have said
more fully elsewhere, that the honor of the
Government It at stake, and thm the law must
be applied to Mr. Huntinston exactly as it
would be appl.ed to any other citizen, or
ea.uality Is destroyed ani the country dls
sractd.
I see the Cabinet has decided on immediate
forclosure in the case of the Uuion Pacific.
That Is the clear and effective remedy in the
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
ca-e of the Central Pacific. It cannot be
mutilated by Congress without a shamefui
yielding of legal rights. Government owner
ship is a bugbear. There is no such issue.
Through honest courts the em Ire debt can be
colleced. There is no i.oint here, as lv the
proceedings agaii'St the Stanford estate, ot
technical constructions of our State constitu
tion and our iMate laws fixing the individual
liability of stockholders. All that is essen
tial is that the bills for forclos
ure be properly drafted, in accordance
with elementary principles of tquity,
long administered and sanctioned, especially
in their appifation to railroads, by numerous
State tribunals, and by the Supreme Court of
the United States. The acts ot Congress, donat
ing lands and indorsing bonds, furnished the
capital which built and equipped the Central
Pacific Railroad. It was this railroad iv work
ing order, not "a streak oi rust," that consti
tuted the security. In creatn.g the railroad,
bo 10 speak, the Government created the secu
rity for twe repayment, oi its advances, and
Mr! Huntington and hisaÂ«s ciates, having the
bondis, the ;and And the railroad, as con
structed, In tneir own possession, became
trustees that the security hnould be kept in
tact. In the loreciosure suns, unless the
National rights are given away, they and their
successors will De compelled :o put back every
do'.iar that was fraudulently taken iroin its
value.
There is no other question then before the
Government than the faith ul application of
the existing law to incontestable facts. By
this method the whole debt, principal and in
terest, will be restored to its fac.- value, and
the issue of' Government ownersnip, on which
there is sucti diversity ot opinion, will not
even arise. A combination of leg'ai caracity
with ordinary industry and integrity will end
the controversy. Tne security will be re
habilitated, the United Staus will have its
money, and let wno will get the railroad.
This is all I have to say, except thni while
every loyal Cnlifornian should rejoice at the
selection of a Cabinet officer from this State
the one proviso should be mat he must not be
a rai.road man. If he Jails in other methods
Mr. Huntington should not be permitted to
beat us by a coup of this sort. Faithfully
yours, ' Kesry E. HIGHTOiJ.
THE BACHELOR MINE HIS
J F. Sanders, One of the Rising
Bonanza Kings ol Ouray,
Is Here.
The Sgnificancs of the Strika at
Leadvilleâ Money Pouring in
From Un on Mines.
J. F. Sanders, owner of the Bachelor
mine at Ouray, Colo., one of the richest
in that part of the country, is at the Bald
win. Mr. Sanders is accompanied by his
family, and H. Hammond of Delta, Colo.,
who is largely interested in mining and
lruit-growing.
The party is here for a few weeks' stay
in orjer to avoid the snows and cold
weather "of Colorado. They will visit
other points in the State, and Mr. Sanders
and Mr. Hammond will not unlikely visit
the new camp of Randsburg, for they are
curious to know just what the mineral
development is there.
The Bachelor mine, which Mr. Sanders
owns, is a queer property, judging from
the standpoint of roost silver mines. Its
ore is extraordinarily rich, and though
tbe output is small so far as the tonnage
is concerned the amount In dollars is
something which i 3 extremely gratif yinrg
to the owners. The product approximates
$50,000 a month.
"All we aim to get out of this mine in a
day," said Mr. Sanders yesterday, ''is one
car of ore. Sometimes we exceed that a
little, but we don't want to. That is
enough. We are satisfied with that. The
ore is rich; the first class runs from 150 to
200 ounces of silver and upward to the
ton. We have had ore there that run a
thousand ounces to the ton, but of course
we don't have a great deal of it. We are
working a force steadily of sixty men.
Our ore goes to Denver for treatment.
"I own other interests at Ouray and
vicinity, as does Mr. Hammond. We are
also quite extensively engaeed in ranch
ing and fru t-growing at Delta, on the
Denver and Rio Grande Narrow Gauge, in
the Gunnison country. The town of
Delta, which now has about 2500 inhabi
tants, is in the center of a magnificent
peach, apple and pear country. Many
other varieties of fruit can be produced
also, and fruit-growing there has got to
be a great business. It is profitable be
cause there is a steady demand for the
fruit all through the mines.
"It is pretty dull a!i over Colorado now.
It is especially dull at Leadville. The
strike there has made business awful
hard. Some of the stores are closing down
and the owners are going to move else
where. They are obliged to because there
is no money in circulation to buy goods;
that is, not enough to keep things going
in a way to make business profitable. But
still there la a vast amount of money
going In there from the miners of Ohio,
Pennsylvania and various sections of the
country to support the men who are out
on the strike. Quite a lot of money has
also been subscribed and is being for
warded to them from the union miners in
different parts of Colorado."
Mr. Sanders' fattier 13 one of the party.

COMPLAINT OF
STONECUTTERS
Trouble Is Anticipi f ed Over
the Ferry Depot
Work.
Journeymen at the Sit^s Quarry
Are Not laid Full
Rates.
The Pac fie Bri ge Company Accused
cf Overworking; aiid Under
paying tae Mtn
Th 6 Sandstone Cutters' Union has a
grievance against the Pacific Bridge Com
pany and last evening a special meeting of
the union was held to consider what is
beat to be done to remedy tae trouble.
The comp!aints are that the company,
which is cutting the stone for the new
ierry depot at the foot of Market street,
is working its men ten hours a day, in
stead of eight, as required for State work,
and tliat it is not t&ying its men the rul
ing rates under which the union has la
bored for years.
The union rules require eipht hours for
five days and four hours on Saturday, at
the rate of 50 cents an hour or $4 a day. A
week or so ago the company advertised for
first-class sandstone-cutters to cut stone at
McPhee & Co.'s quarry at Sites, Colusa
County. A lot of union men went from
this City to Sites and were appalled at
what they found there. They went in
person because the advertisement stated
that no letters of inquiry would be an
swered. Applicants for employment were
told that they could work, but that ten
hours' bervice would be expected of them
for the six days and that the pay was 30
cents an hour or $3 a day.
A number of men were found at work,
but they were evidently men from the in
terior, not attached to unions and com
pelled to take anything offered, as they
had no money to get away. The stone
cutters of San Jfrancisco relused to work
on such terms and those who had money
returned Ht once to tnis City. Several
had no money, as they expected to go to
work at once, and they are tramping over
the rails now. George Knight, Clem
K.nÂ«iser and John Kolf walked thirty-six
miles to a point where their limited means
would permit them to secure tickets
home.
Tins condition of affairs provoked great
indignation at the meeting last evening
ana several" spirited speeches were made.
In their remarks the speakers called at
tention to the fact that wh n the con
tractors â the Pacific Bridge Company â re
ceived the contract for the lerry depot
building th? stonework was estimated on
the union basis from the .figures of Mc-
Phee & Co., the lowest bidders on the
stonework.
The stonecutters think it is an outrage
that such a cut should be made in order
that the contractors might profit at the
exnense of the workmen.
One of the union men in his remarks
said: "The stonecutters of this City are
all taxpayers and should receive the bene
lit of this work, which is a City as well as
a State building. In fact the stone should
all be cut in the City instead of at the
quarry."
It was decided to appoint a special com
mittee, consisting of George Q. Bruce and
Thomas Lee, to call upon the Harbor
Commissioners to-day and do what is
possible to compel the Pacific Bridge
Company to pay the regular rates of wages
and to compel" the company to work its
men only eight hours a day, as required
by law, on btate work.

business man, but he retired several years
ago. He leaves a family of eight children â

ITS MARVELOUS POWER.
Paine's Celery Compound Bettar Than
Years of Doctoring.
There was never a remedy so eminently
successful, so far above and beyond ail
competition, as Paine's celery compound.
Paine's celery compound effects marvel-
ous cures.
Where other remedies miserably fail,
and where doctors do not succeed, there
Paine's celery compound is found curing
disease, making people well and happy.
Here is the case of Mrs. Haff, who lives
at 140 Summer Aye., Newark, N. J., and
whose portrait is printed here.
"My doctor," she says, "called my dis-
ease liver complaint, stomach trouble,
nervous dyspepsia, andalmo t every other
name you could think of. When I was in
Portland, Ore., I had enlargement of the
liver, and the doctor thought air the
troubles came from that severe spell of
illness. That was 12 years ago, and I have
done nothing but doct>r ever since. 1
have had the best physicians examine me,
and see if they could do anything for me.
For months at a time my stomach and
liver have been so sore that I could lie in
bed only in misery, and with such severe
pain in my back, and so weak that I could
hardly talk.
"After I had a bad night, I would send
for the doctor, and he would leave me a
small box of powders and one or two otner
medicines, and it would cost me $4 every
time I had one of thess spells. 1 believe
I have taken more medicine tnan any
other living woman.
"Last March I had a call from a lady
friend of mine, who asked me, 'What is
thft matter with you ?' I replied by say-
ing, 'How well you look ?' 'Yes,' she

Paine's celery compound a fair trial, and
if it does not "do it then they might as well
die. I have recommended it to several

The arrow flies with thÂ» wind. Tbe top flgnrM
at station indicate maximum temperature for thÂ«
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of

word -'hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: -'low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanli-d by cloudy weather and rain*.
"Lows" ns'ially first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low alon*c the coast, and the isobars extend
north andsouth along the coast, rain is probable:

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer

CHICAGO. In,, Jan. 29.-The wheat market
: opened with every Dear feature in good working
[ order, and an attempt was made to bring aoout
j another smash in prices, but It soon became appar
ent that, there was a' supporting power at work,
and it did not take long for the crowd to change
front and help along prices. Liverpool opening
cables were lower, second ones gave a recovery
i and that assisted the belle, fueling here. Receipts
i at Chicago weie 26 cars, and 66,*Â«38 bushels were
taken from store. The .\orthwest bad 194 cars
aga.nst 276 las Friday and 511 a year ago. In
the last hour 1 her? was a repetition of yesterday's
action, prices succumbing to heavy offerings of
lung wheat. .'4JESH
A snarp break occurred, pries dropping almost
to tbe inside put figure. Closing Continental ca
bles were generally lower, although fu.l sympathy
with American weakness was not shown. Export
clearances amounted to 183,818 bushels. At the
close shorts covered free y and a reaction re
sulted. May wneat opened from 74S/ B @74VsC.

CÂ«-R.Nâ The earlier steady tone 01 wheat aided
that of corn . Throughout me recent demoraliza
tion in the leading cereals corn has displayed re
markable firmness, sympathizing but Indifferently
with toe cine. Liverpool cab.es gave a decline
of i/id on 'corn to-day. Receipts were 220 cars,
and 172,531 bushels were withdrawn from store.
Export clearances were heavy at 614.808 bushels.
The late weakness or wheat caused corn to display
an easier tone, b t when tbe ra ly came at the clo-e
the latter rose 14. May corn sold between 24% c
and 23% c. Closing a: 24% c, %@Vs c over yester
day. Estimated receipts tu-mor ow 290 cars.
! OATS â Torre was the same improvement in
oats as made in the other grains. No extraordi

UNION STOCKYARDS, Ilu. Jan. 29.-The
I entire week's receipts in cattle will foot up 42,500
bead, but sellers did not obtain any advance. The
few lots o really choice corn fed were dispose! of
at good prices, bat medium grades showed con
{ siderable weakness. There was an average Fri-
I day supply to-day. The demand was good as is
1 usual during the latter pan of the week, anl prices
i were steady. Owing to the Intensely cold weather
this week's receipts of hogs have showed a large
fai.ing off as compared with recent weeks. There
was not the slightest improvement in prices, bow
i ever, and much of the values were heavy with
I little outside competition, us tbe cold weather pre
vented Eastern shippers from operating freely on
several days. To-Qay'Â» arrivals were 22,000 head
against nearly 34.000 last Friday. Prices ruled
firm unaer the iuflnen :.- of a good demand, lhe
weed's receipts of sheep win aggregate about

stopped. , â¢
similar things are son in other industries and
the additional establishments are not starting
without some increase in orders received. It
would jo more harm than cood to exaggerate the
Improvement, but a study of the conditions gov
erning business ind.cates that the wbeels are on
the right .ruck and moving in the ri^ht direction.
Men talked of a possible drain of gold a month
ago, but January has passed "lid the liquidation of
foreign indebtedness to this country seems further
off than ever. Mercaudise exports from New
York in January have been about per cent
smaller than last year's, when the excess of ex
ports was over 00,000, while exports from
other ports hare also been larger. The month hns
not diminished but-increased the current balance
due this country. Money markets become more
easy and favorable 10 legitimate business. The
reduction in wheat was over 6 cents. in spite of a
rt-noned yield far below that generally accepted,
reflecting perception of the error of the report and
the enormous exports of cornâ Bo,ooo,ooo bushe.s
in eight month.*.
When corn can be had for less than wheat it la
largely preferred in European markets, and In
January 7,875.127 bushels of corn has gone
abroad from Atlantic ports against 5,630,419 last
year, while Atlantic exports of wheat and flour
have been 6,515,135 bushels against 8,843 679
last year. As the Government crop of corn pre
verted much advance in its price it al o affects the
demand for wheat, and a heavy liquidation has oc
curred, with the price of corn scarcely changing.
Cotton looks less attractive to traders because
American millers are laboring with plans to re
duce a large surplus of goods and prices have de
clined. Takings of Noi them spinners have been
in live months 44,000 bales less loan last year
and 423,000 less iban in 1894-9.V
sales or wool in January have never been sur
passed in that month nor in any other month ex
cept last >ovember and July of 1895 and 1892.
The price has remained about steady.
'l he iron and steel manufactures show little
gains, production having increased so heavily be
fore, and the gradual enlargement O' demand for
finished products has not overtaken that Increase.
Lower prices result for Bessemer pig, gray Jorge
and for Southern iron a Chicago, for cut nails,
and the average of all quotations is the largest
since ast year. For sheets there is active de
mauil and better demand lor bars on account of
car-building. Tin and copper are a shade stronger,
but competition causes sales of tin plates iu@lsc
below the agreed puces. .
Failures lor the week have been 331 in the
United State*, a:alnst 404. and 60 In Canada,
aealnsi 70 last year.

COAL- Harrison's circular says: V "Durinj: the
week there nave been 10 arrivals from the Coait
collieries with 20,39 tons of lo;il. from Australia
two cargoes aggregating 4053 ions. Coalcarts aie
kept busy delivering loads very tretly tarough the
city, prlnclDaliy for house useÂ«. yet some of the
yards appear to be carrying very full stocks 01 do
mestic grades, which it exceptional at this season
of the year. Orders for luture loading of English
and Australian are not going forward as freely as
is usual In January. The asking prices for Aus
tralian are certainly low enough to induce large
consumers 10 become generous buyers. The ask
ing freight rates >rpm. British shipping ports are
relallvelv much higher than from the Colonies,
hence but little English is being loaded. Ihe an
ticipation 01 an early Chang- of the duty rate on
Coal makes buyers very cautions as it is always a
conundrum what conclusion tariff framers may
arrive at. shipments of wheat and flour to Aus
tralia were peculiarly exceptional; these are now
being followed by vessels going from here in bal
last to New caatl , .N. S. W. , to oring Coal back at
about $3 * ton freight, which is aUoan exceptional
transaction. Th cc dollars i* ton freight for the
two voyages (there and return) clearly demon
strates how demoralized our local freight rates
have become, as such voyages barely pay running
expenses of the vessel." -â¢.-,.â

NOW A MINISTER
His Marriage to the Daugh
ter of a Wealthy Ukiah
Official.
Four Years Ago He Terrified
Old Realty Dealers in
Berkeley.
Started in Life a- :i Shooting-GaHery
Proprietor, and Lost a Fortune
in Opera.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Jan. 29. )
The thousands of people on this side the
bay who knew GeorKe W. Phelps, the real
estate man of Berkeley, five years ago
were surprised to-day to learn that he is
now a regularly ordained minister and was
married yesterday in Uuiati to the daugh
ter of W. D. White, a capitalist and Trus
tee of that city.
Rev. George W. Phelps has had a more
eventful history than usually falls to the
lot of a young nian even in California.
f: ked by wonderful aggressiveness and
ek, he has entered into many specala
ns, but one after- the other they have
en to the ground. Many years ago
jlps was proprietor of a shooting-gal
lery at Sacramento, and while there he
was taken up by the Salvation Army, and
for a time was an earnest exhorter in their
ranks. Not long afterward he met and
married a charming young lady of Colusa
named Cristie Willis, who was at that
time one of the foremost army officers.
She is well remembered nt Salem, Or., as
the officer w&o could do more witti the
Webfoot Legislature than auy other evan
gelist that ever went to that city.
The Se;iator3 and Assemblymen used to
consider it an honor to furnish tne army
quarters with all the luxuries that moiey
could buy, and her audiences were of the
most respectable nature. To such a de
gree was she idolized by trie people of
Salem, that it became necessary for the
good of the work to remove her as instead
of her life being the one of sacrifice such
as is typical of army hfe, it was one of
luxury. It was soon aftefc leaving Salem
that she married George Phelps.
After his marriage Phelps came to
Berkeley and for a time did an immense
real estate business and was looked upon
as one of the most formidable competitors
to the old-time business men. He became
moderately rich and real estate at that
lime being on the rise, Phelps was con
sidered a lucky man. In an evil moment
he was pursuaded to purchase the right of
an operetta known as "Eileen" and went
to Chicago to organize a company.
His marked ability in selling real estate
did not appiy with equal results to pre
senting operas, and Phelps returned to
California a wiser and much less wealthier
man.
He then commenced the study of the
ology and ior a time was a diligent stu
dent". But the early death of his young
wife upset all his plans, and for a long
t;me Phelps had not been heard of in this
county.
About two years a-go he succeeded in
.ng a very creditable law examination
MiSS JESSIE COLEMAN, the Next Society Bride to Bz Led to
the Altar. She Is to Wed Harry J. Knowles*
before the Supreme Court and opened a'
law office in Ban Francisco. But the old
religious convictions again overcame him
and he returned to the seminary at San
Anselmo.
For some time past he has been officiat
ing as pastor at iJkiah, and is now a reg
ularly ordained minister, and declares I
that he has settled down ior life.
His marriage to Miss White, who is a
daughter of the wealthy lumberman of
that city, is a great surprise, as it was not
known that he had been ordained or that
he was intending to. marry again.
TEACHERS RESENT IT.
The Special* Professor's Subscription Is
, Regarded by Many as an
o .".', Imposition.'-
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 29.â The teach
ers in the public schools do not admit the
absolute correctness of the Superintend
ent's statement published yesterday re
garding the payment of $10 per head to
an Eastern professor io teach a special
â branch to the teachers. In an interview
one of the teachers who refused to tafce
the course said it was considered a slur on
the capabilities of the teachers to have to
pÂ»y $100 a month for a small amount of
soientihc instruction, when they them
selves receive only $70 to $80 per month
for eiving their whole time.
vWe aTe certainly old enough and
sensible enough," said the teacher, "not
to be put before the public as if we
were Btill in leading strings. We claim
that our time is our own and we are at
liberty to select our own teachers, our
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
j own texts and to pay just what we please
j for any instruction that may be necessary.
' The Superintenden t may talk as he pleases
about not havine anything to do with the
matter, but it is certainly strange that the
only information we received concerning
the date of the lectures comes direct from
his office, signed by his hand and stating
that it would be 'a good tbing for the
teachers to attend."
As a municipal election is approaching
and the Board of feci.ool Directors will
have to elect a Superintendent of Schools
it is more than probable that the present
dissatisfaction expressed by many of the
teachers has a political significance.
END OF DEUX TEMPS.
To Disband Becaune Its Youthful Mem-
tiers Cannot Keep Young.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 29.â 0n the even
ing ol February 16 the famous Deux Temps
Club will cease to exist. This fashionable
dancing organization has existed Tor four
seasons and has been prolific of many in
teresting stories. At one time it was in
danger ot disruption because sorre young
men did not wp.ir patent-leather shoes
and the black nÂ» from their clumsy bro
gana soiied the dresses ot the young ladies
during the poetic measure of the valse.
Mmea. J. E. McElrath, Prentice Selby,
John Wrignt, Knight, Liliencranz, Crellin
and Moore, who are the patronesses of the
Deux Temps, held a meeting last Monday
and decided to disband the organization
after the next dance, which will be held
two week? from next Tuesday.
The club has had a moderately success
ful career, but the memDers who have
graduated from it into tne Wednesday
Night Cotillon, have not been succeeded
by otbeis, and to a great extent the
club has grown itselt out of existence.
The Deux Temps was for young ladies
of society who were not old enough
to attend the Wednesday Night Cotillon
and were too for advanced in the social

Requa and afew other ladies established

so long as the original membershiplasted,

foregone conclusion.
SOCIETY'S NEXT WEDDING.
The Knowles-Coleman Nuptials
Will Be a Brilliant Event
of spring.
Both Are Social Leaders and Very
. Popular in the Jackson-
Street Set.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
9US Broadway, Jan. 29. )
Society is looking forward to the mar
riage of Miss Jessie Coleman and Harry
J. Knowles, who have long been consid
ered social leaders on tnis side of the bay.
The engagement has been announced, and
the wedding is to take place in the spring.
It will undoubtedly be a very brilliant af
fair, as both families are long residents of
this city, have hosts of friends and have
unbounded wealth.
For several months the wedding has
been expected, and society expects itÂ« de
sire to attend a gorgeous ceremony to be
gratified in March.
Miss Jessie Coleman is very popular in
Oakland society. She was the only daugh
.ter of tde late Jotin W. Coleman, and was
a very successful graduate of Mills Sem
inary- a year or two ago. Since that time
she has taken a leading part in social
functions, and has been one of the most
prominent members of the Bachelors'
and Benedicts' Cotillon Club. The death
of her father a little more than a year ago
and the consequent mourning prevented
the marriage taking place earlier.
Mr. Coleman left a large estate, includ
ing several ranches and valuable stock to
corporations. He was president of the
Oakland Gas Light and Heat Company
and vice-president of the Oakland Street
Railway Company and the San Francisco
and San Joaquiu Coal Company.
The Coleman family resilience, at Eighth
and Brush streets, is one of the finest in
the City and has been the scene of some
very memorable entertainments.
Harry J. Knowles is the son of the late
Captain J. N. Knowles. who died last
June. The family reside at Fifteenth and
Jackson str ets, and Mr. Knowles is cashier
of the Pacific Steam Whaling Company.
For a long time he was captain of the
Columbia Rowing Club, which is com
posed mostly of Oakland's wealthy young
men. He is the eldest son of a large fam
ily. Mrs. Harry Gordon, Mrs. Harvey
Adams and Miss Mattie Knowles, all well
known in local society, are his sisters.'

Still After Twombley'a Estate.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. Josephine
Powell made another attempt to-day to
open the estate of Martha A. Twombley,
the old colored woman who died in 1879,
leaving a will in which she bequeathed
her property to Charles A. Twombley, her
husband. Mrs. Powell in her new peti
tion-sets up that the marriage was void,
being contrary to the law which prohibits
miscegenation. She further alleges that
she is the niece of the old colored woman,
and at the time of the probate of the will
she did not get the notice whicn an heir
is entitled to.

and in exactly half an hour it completed
its labors. The convention was in session
forty-five minutes, fifteen of which were
consumed ill recess. 1
The formality of calling the roll was
dispensed with, and the chairman an
nounced that the committee of seven
which was commissioned to go last night

committee and to attend to the details of
the election.
There was no platform and the ordi

The chairman stated t :i at the purpose of

FIGHT OVER A PASTOR.
Two Petitions Beng Circulated
in Centenary Presbyterian
Church.
Rev. Dr. Ellis Is Accptab c to Many
and I. Opposed by 0 hers Who
Are Powerful.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Jan. 29. j
The trouble at the Centenary Presby
terian Church will reach a crisis next
Monday evening, when a meeting will be
held of all those interested.
During the past few days two petitions
have been circulated, one favorable to the
pastor and one opposing him.
The leading spirit of the opposition is
Mr. Prosstr, one of the elders, and it was
stated to-night that his petition for a
chanse of pastors contained the names of
F. S. Hastings, A. K. Dorn and F. H.
Cruff, all of whom are elders of the
church. In addition to this a large por
tion of the Christian Endeavor Society
would like another pastor.
On the other hand, a large number of
the congregation are satisfied with Rev.
Dr. Ellis and would like him to be in
stalled as permanent pasior. Miss Brady
is earnestly working in bis behalf and she
iB supported by Mr. Charles, Mrs. Childs
and Deputy Auditor Hinsdale.
There will be a session of Uio presbytery
held next Monday and the rival petitions
will be presented.
"Nobody seems to know just what is
the matter at our church, " said an old
member to-night "Dr. Ellis seems to be
acceptable to the majority, but there is a
dissatisfied element, and they are some of
the most powerful members of the church.
There may be some little objections to
Mr. Ellis, but tney could ea-ily be
straightened out if everything were above
board. As it is, the standing of the
church is being gradually whispered to
death."
At the last meeting of the presbytery
Dr. Ellis was to have been installed for
mally, but a special committee reported
in favor of a postponement, and there
was a long discussion, but eventually the
installation was deferred. It will be
settled next week.
NOTHING BUT POLITICS.
Much Curiosity as to the Course of the
Municipil Lengun.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Jan. 29.â Every
branch of the city government is now sub
ordinated to politics. The usual board
meetings are being held and the officials
are performing their daily routine duties
in a perfunctory manner, j ut the prevail
ing idea at the City Hall is the election in
the first week in -March which shull deter
mine their fates for another two years.
The statement was made to-day that
there may not be any political indorse
ments made by the A. P. A., but the ad
visory board nas not yet issued an ulti
matum on the subject. There is some
opposition to the organization to talcing
part actively in the campaign. The
greater portion of the Republican ticket is
said to be entirely satisfactory to the
A. P. A., and although a meeting may be
called to discuss the matter there will
probably be no convention such as was
held prior to other elections during the
past four years.
Captain W. R. Thomas, the Republican
nominee for Mayor, is seriously ill at his
home, and with several members of his
family is suffering from grippe. The
Army and Navy Republican League is
doing all in its power to carry on his cam
paign, but he is certainly not gaining any
thing by his enforced absence from the
field, as his opponents are working very
actively. The Municipal League will hold
a convention next Monday night, which
will be one of policy rather than politics.
In former years the Municipal League has
been considered as the allied strength of
the A. P. A. and the political element led
by Dr. George Pardee. This year Dr. Par
dee took a prominent part in the regular
Republican convention, and with his
friends will undoubtedly support it The
A. P. A. is not particularly anxious to
take an active part, and consequently the
niche left for the Municipal League to fill
is not a large one and cannot cut an im
portant figure in the camr'aign.

CASPAR OUTRUN
BY GREYHURST
Tommy Griffin's Youngster
Is a Rollicking
Mudlark.
Geyser Started an Odds â On
Favorite and Won as He
Pleased.
Marionette Finished in Front and So
Did Whittstoneâ Collins Out
footed His Company.
iSix of the fastest three-year-olds in
training on the coast started in a six and
a half furlong sprint at Ingleside yester
day and through some clever jockeying
Caspar, the even-money favorite, was
beaten ont a length at the end. Zamar 11,
the second choice, apparently in as a
helper only, made Caspar hustle for about
tnree furlongs, when, having performed
his task, he began falling back and Grey
hurst took bold of the favorite. The St.
Andrew colt hung on gamely, but was
finally compelled to acknowledge defeat
by a length in the fast time of 1:23%.
Good Times took the show from Zamar 11.
Mud again proved quite a serious factor
in working the downfall of the favorites,
but two managing to get to the wire first
The rain held aloof and the usual crowd
was in attendance.
Twelve platers, devoid of any great
amount of class, lined up at the webbing
in the opening five-furlong scramble. Imp.
Friar was a slight favorite over Marionette,
but in a drive was beaten out nearly a
length by that mare, with Rejecte.l finish
ing in the show.
The five-furlong spin following was a
second edition oi the opening event, with
field of fiiteen facing the barrier. Baron,
owned by Billy Magrane, was quickly
played down from fours to 13 to 5 and
finished next to last. In a mild drive
Whitestone passed the wire a length ahead
of Pecksniff. Tiie winner went to the post
at odds of 5 to 1.
Starting an even-money chance, Collins
experienced little difficulty in defeating
his lieui in a mile and a furJong, winning
aa he pleased from Charles A, which went
to the po9t at odds of 12 to 1. Fortune,
the second choice, ran into the show.
The 7 to 5 favorite, Loulou R, was left
at the post in the fourth event, a seven
furlong run. She acted very badly, and
when the barrier flew up refused to break.
Basquil led until well into the stretch,
when he was challenged by Personne and
in a hard drive beaten a nose. Show
honors went to Draught.
The promising youngster Geyser
started a ,2 to 5 cboice over the other
starters in the seven-furlong affair that
came next. The Sinner opened up a big
gap at the outset, but. began tiring before
the stretch was reached, and was passed
by both the favorite and George Palmer,
the former winning with the utmost ease.
TARPEY STAKE TO-DAY.
A Grand Field Will Face the Starter
at Ingleslde.
The Tarpey selling state over a mile
and a furlong is the feature of the card
this afternoon. Or the original seventy
three entries ten are announced as likely
to start, and they are a select lot. Argen
tina, which lowered the colors of Bright
Phoebus on Thursday, Pat Dunne's good
horse Captive, St. Lee, Schiller and others,
all with light weights up, furnish a rare
guessing proposition, and there is not
likely to be a top-heavy favorite in the
betting. The winner will pluck from the
wire a silken ba^ containing $1000.
After finishing second in the opening
five-furlong dash little Brown was unable
to pull imp. Friar up, and he made an
other circle of the track.
On her way to the post Marionette tried

to the stand, with Charley pulling and
hauling like the anchorman on a tug-of

refused.

The owner of Popinjay was fined $25 for

Starter Dick Havey's work has been
exceptions: ly good during the present
meeting. His quick starts on Wednes
day, when seven lields were sent away
and people got home in ample time for
dinner, call forth praise on all sides. The
recall flag may have its virtues, but il also
has its setbacks, as evidenced by the long
delays at Oakland track.
Billy Magrane's old horse Baron was a
warm one from the end stall to win the
second race, but, getting away from the
post pooriy, Willie Martin contented him
self wit!) ' watching the others run. He
was reported to have outworked Frank X
at Oakland and may do over a longer dis
tance in future.
Judging from his performance yester
day, it is quite evident that Personne is
not a horse that requires weight to steady
him. It was a great improvement over
his preceding public appearance.
Johnny McHalo, the genial little South
ern horseman, is experiencing a run of
hard luck In California. Some time ago
his horse, Johnny McHaie, was kicked on
the leg at the po9t in a race and was :ben
nosed out for the purse. Since that time
ho has been on the snelf. It looks as
though Basquil should have won a race
or two that he has been beaten in and
yesterday was nosed out by fersonne.

The Matron Is Poisoned.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 29.-M.rs. Hattie
McDonald, the new matron of the Receiv
ing Hospital, is critically, ill from blood
poisoning. About two weeks ago, while
attending to a patient, she had a scratch
on her linger which absorbed some poi
sonous virus and her health is now
dangerously threatened. Alias Lou Rey
nard of Fabiola Hospital is temporarily in
charge of the Keceiving riospi'.al.
Says F. SI. Smith la Liable.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 29.â The Cali
fornia and Nevada Railroad Company
filed its answer to-day in a suit brouzht
against them by Christian Nelson, who
wants several thousand aollars for alleged
injuries on their train. The railroad asserts
that in 1893 F. M. Smith contracted to
take charge of the road and operate the
cars, and that, therefore, he ana not the
company is liable for any damages.
Poultry Show to Soon Close.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 29.â The poultry
show will close on Sunday evening. Every
night there is an attractive programme on
the stage by well-known actors and acro
bats. The wet weather has interfered
somewhat with the attendance, but the
show merits liberal patronage, which it
will be no doubt accorded on the closing
days.
KEW TO-SAT.
' TWO TAILS.
Also Two Tales.
Several years ago one of the popular
humorists, scientifically inclined, con-
cluded to make some experiments with
iced tea, the popular summer drink. The
result of his investigations is given in his
own words. â¢ â¢ < â¢Â» < Â«â¢â¢ . .- r .'
"I secured a sample of the tea at one of
the restaurants in town to get a fair aver-
age of the article used. I took a teaspoon-
f ul of the liquid to the household pump;
it was stirred into a large tub filled with
water and in a moment the color of the
tea had disappeared. Any one will admit
that this solution would seem harmless
even to the healthy lower animals. We
had some young puppies in the barnyard
and I procured two of the smallest of
tnera; they were allowed- to lap' at the
liquid, and then their heads were held
under the water for fifteen minutes. It re-
sulted in the death of both the puppies,
and the. dangerous properties of the de-
coction were made apparent.'' . (
It is all very well to have a bit of fun
from the experiments in food and drink,
but there are many nowadays who are
really hurt, and hurt seriously from the
use of coffee.
A new breakfast beverage has been Dro- 1
duced -which looks like coffee in the deep
seal brown color and which changes to the
rich golden brown of thick Mocha when
cream is added. It has been introduced'
extensively this season, and' is made from
cereals, the common grain of the field. It
is nourishing and healthful, without hav-
ing the hurtiul properties of coffee. The
weakest stomach can handle the grain
coffee, and the taste and color is so agree-
able and coffee-like that it fills the piaee
nicely. This food-drink-, Postum, can be
given to small children regularly for coffee
at breakfast, and is nourishing and fat-
tens their bodies. It is a liquid food,
made from the grains the Creator intended
for man's subsistence. Manufactured by
the Postum Cereal Co., Lim., Battle Creek,
Mich. .
"Just as good" as Postum Cereal are
words used to defraud the public.

SUICIDE, SAYS THE
CORONER'S JURY
But Dr. Hawkins Refused
to Accept th-3 Verdict
Rendered.
He Said the Evidence Did Not
Warrant Any Such
Finding.
Delirious From Etc ssive Drinking
Was the Conclusion of the
Twelve.
The Coroner's inquest held yesterday in
the case of Charles C. Nordhausen, the
Oakland capitalist, who died in St. Luke's
Hosfcital from a revolver shot, threw no
light upon the mystery surrounding the
case. It was productive, however, of a
difference of opinion between Coroner
Hawkins and the jury.
The witnesses in the Baldwin Hotel,
where Nordhauaen is supposed to have
shot himself, told of the many drinks,
straight and mixed, that the guest had
taken previous to the discovery of his seri
ous condition, and this. led the jury to re
turn a verdict of "suicide while delirious
from excessive drink."
To this finding the following names were
attached:
E. L. Haller (foreman),- Nals Bhaping, H.
Lundbert, H. Lucas, Allen Leidholdt, Charles
Fye, J. G. Johsistone, C. Psall, William Mosser,
W. 8. Jacobs, Harry Leff, C. H. Lund Jr.
The Coroner Would not have it that way,
however.and refused to accept tbe verdict,
claiming that there was not!. ing in the
testimony presented to the jury to war
rant such a finding. He did not object to
the suicide feature, but the delirious part
he said was not warranted by the testi
mony of a single witnoss. He will ask
the police to make further investigation.
Should there be any new developments
another inquest is in the line of possibili
ties, particularly where the verdict given
yesterday was not accepted by Dr. Haw
kius.
As stated, the case was not cleared o:
the mystery by any of the witnesses who
testified.
Nordhausen was a capitalist living at
1322 Adeline street, Oakianu. About the
20th inst. he left his home to go to Randj
burg, wh/re he had some mining interests
to look after. For several days nothing
was heard of him, and when his family
did receive a message it was that he was
dying in St. Luke's Hospital, to which he,
had been conveyed from the Baldwin
Hotel. He' was suffering from an ui;ly
and fatal pistol-bullet wound in the leit
side and an unsightly wound on his foie
head.
J. D. Pettit, the bellboy at the Baldwin,
testified that Nordhausen on Monday
morning bad informed him that he had
accidentally shot himself, and that the
jacged wound in the head was the result
of a fall. Previous to that the Oakland
capitalist had been drinking heavily in
his room, and he explained the presence
of the towel on his head by saying that h?
was buffering from the effects of a spree
and had a headache.
Frank Smith, also a bellboy, gave simi
lar testimony as to the man's excessive
drinking and of his wearing a towel on
his head.
Manager Lake of the hotel told of find
ing the revolver in the room after the
wounded guest's removal; also of there
being a bullet hole in the window glass,
that 6howed that the shot had been fired
inside of the room. He said that no one
in the hotel had heard the shots. In fact,
the adjoining rooms were not occupied at
the time.
D.-. C. M. Armstrong of St. Luke's Hos
pital testified that he bad asked Nord
hausen if a woman had shot him, to
which the wounded man answered, "You
must not ask me that. It makes no differ
ence now."
Robert Durst, a nurse at the hospital,
testified that the wounded man bad told
him that it was an accident.
The only witness who hinted at foul
play was Dr. W. E. Taylor, the ex-Coro
ner. Dr. Taylor was the first physician
called to N-ordhausen whiie the latter was
in the hotel. He said that the wound in
the breast was at least thirty-six hours
old when he first saw it. I lie wound on
the head he believed was caused by a Dlow
from a biunt instrument and not by a
fall, as Nordhausen bad stated. Dr. Tay
lor's evidence showed that he does not
believe the man shot himself.
Detective Whitaker could not throw
any lij;ht upon the matter, bathe believed
lrom all appearances that it was a plain
case of suicide. Dr. C. L. Morgan, the
autopsy physician, testified that it was
possible for deceased to have shot himself
in the body and produced such a wound
as caused his death, but the man must
have assumed an unnatural position to
have done *o. He did not believe the
wound on the head was either caused by a
bullet or a fall, but by a blow from a blunt
instrument.
Mrs. Nordhauien, the widow, was not
able to appear, and the nephew, C. J.
Heaseman, knew nothing of the affair.
Nordhausen was a native of Germany, 48
years oid. Whether the case will drop
here or be further investigated remains
to be seen.

NEW COONEY
SENSATION
Facsimiles of Crocker
Blanks Printed by J.
H. Barry.
CAPTAIN LEES INTI
MATES CONSPIRACY.
Simply an Idea to Test the Skill
of Experts, Say the
Defense.
FAIR HEIRS WOULD USE IT AS
EVIDENCE.
The Notary's Attorneys Fight Back,
Saying the Incident Has No
Place in the Case.
A new and somewhat exciting chapter
was opened in the Cooney case yesterday.
From out of the dragnet of Captain L<ees
and his detective force came the fact that
during the past week there had been
primed by James H. Barry 2000 fac-similes
of the famous Crocker notarial blanks of
January 8, 1896, with which the Fair in
terests are sesking to identify the acknowl
edgments on the pencil cieeds.
In the printing of.these blanks by Barry
Captain Lees claims he unearthed a con
spiracy. He insinuates that on its face
the existence of these reproductions of the
Crocker forms looks Jike a scheme to
spreao. them broadcast with a view to hav
ing some of them returned as evidence in
toe young notary's lavor.
The people who are representing
Cooney deny the chief of detectives'
charges. They explain that the printing
of the Barry blanks hud for its purpose a
plan to test the skill of the experts, who,
according to the programme of the prose
cution, are to be called to point out the j
defects in the Crocker forms and identify
them with tnoae in the certificates in the j
pencil deeds. This is a ruse generally re
sorted to when the matter of expert testi
many is introduced, t-ay Cooney's lawyers. |
The Barry blanks are fac-similes of the j
Crocker forms, as the printing was done
from a zinc plate made from a photo
graph.
It was and is their plan to introduce
these blanks in the case, so the lawyers
for the delense assert, in connection with
a number of the Crocker originals, and ask
the experts to select one from another.
The keynote in the case against Cooney
are typographical imperfections in the
certificates he used on Mrs. Craven's
deeds. In the chain of evidence by which
the police seek to convict him of perjury
they declare that in the forms printed by
Crocker similar and identical defects
occur. Witnesses from Crocker's print
ing-houÃe have already said that they
could identify any of these blanks by these
same defects in printing.
It was to test the truth of the state
ments ol these .witnesses, the Cooney de
fense say, demanded the printing of a
similar lot of blanks. It is customary in
all cases where experts on typography or
handwriting are called in to subject them
to every possible test. In the Snaron and
Martin cases these tactics were adopted,
much to the discomfiture of experts. Fol
lowing the logic of tbe Cooney side of the
case, if one of the experts could not de
tect the difference between tne Barry and
Crocker printing the cause of expert testi
mony would receive a body blow.
Captain Lees and Charlie Fair's attor
neys are not inclined to give a great deal
of credence to the explanation offered by
Cooney's attorneys. The chief of detec
tives declares he nipped a scheme in the
bud. He says that if the object of print
ing the Barry blanks was simply to test
theskillofexperts.it was not necessary
to strike off so many of them. He hints
that had it not been for his timely discov
ery a plan was on foot to scatter these cer
tificates among notaries and attorneys
for the pumose of regathering them at the
proper time as evidence in Cooney's be
half. Moreover, he declares that it was a
questionable transaction for Barry to
print the footline of the Crocker printing
house on the margin.
James H. Barry and Coonev's attorney
are equally emphatic in denying that it
was ever intended to put tbe blanks into
circulation. All the forms, with tbe ex
csption of a half dozen submitted to
C'ooney's attorneys for inspection, are still
in his possession, according to Barry, and
have been there for a week. This in itself,
he declares, is a strong indication that no
idea of putting them in circulation was
ever dreamed of.
"Some days ago," said Barry, "I was
called to the office of Attorney D. M.
Delmas and asked by Mr. Delmas and De
tective Stilwell if I could reproduce the
Crocker blanks. I replied that I was
afraid that I had not the proper typo. I
was finally obliged to use a photograph
and make a zinc etching of it. Now the
blanks were printed in four batches.
"In the first bundle Crocker's name ap
peared at the foot of tbe document to
complete the reproduction, but the print
ing was bad, and I was satisfied the ex
perts would detect the flaws. I came to
KEW TO-DAT.

Witnesses and Experts "Who Appeared in Judge Cook's Courtroom
Yesterday.
the conclusion to cut off the Crocker foot
line, but after the job was over 1 thouglit
this omission â¢would at once convince the
experts that Crocker did not do the job.
Then I used the zinc plate of the body of
the blank, using type in the Crocker foot
line. The type was not a good imitation,
so that I finally was obliged to photograph
the Crocker printing-house foot line and
add it to the other plate.
"In this manner 1 got a perfect fac
simile of the blank of January 8, 1896. So
you see there is but 500 of the genuine fac
similes, instead of 2000, as Captain ]>es
intimates. In the remaining 1500 no ex
pert would be deceived, so I think that no
more were printed than wou.d be neces
sary for use in the case, with its many
witnesses. These blanks are all in my
possession now, and have been so for four
days previous to the 'marc's nest 1 Cap
tain Lees professes to have discovered. No
attempt was made to circulate them, and
no such idea was entertained."
The fact that Crocker's name appears
on the foot line was put there, so Cooney's
attorneys say, for the sole purpose of com
pleting the fac-simile. They had a right
to use it, they say, ior the purposes tuey
intended the blanks.
When this affair was precipitated into
the hearing of Cooney before Magistrate
Cook yesterday morning ratber unexpect
edly the way was opeDed for the liveliest
session in the case up to date. All day
lone the proceedings were a wrangle of
words and legal fencing.
The lawyers for (Jooney and the District
Attorney bickered and bantered over the
right to introduce the evidence in the
case. Their voices rose high, so high that
the echoes rang along tbe corridors of ttie
City Hall, and the idle and curious mob
hurried in great numbers to tiie scene of
the tumult.. When the fun was at its
height Attorney George A. Knight
jumped into the dispute, and got an op
portunity to interlard a spicy dialogue
upon the District Attorney's declaring
that young Fair's legal adviser was also
assisting in the prosecution.
It was on the card that Expert Max
Gumpel should take up tbe greater part
of the day in expatiating on defects in
handwriting and printing in general, and in
particular as far as they referred 10 the
Cooney acknowledgments and their simi
larity to the Crocker blanks. Theodore
Kytka, the photographer who made bro
mide enlargement! of the certificates on
the pencil deeds, not on tbe stand to nar
rate how this work was done and ran up
against a snag in procedure because the
District Attorney and his assistant had
overlooked bringing the negatives from
which the enlarged reproductions were
made into court. Kytka was laid on the
shell temporarily to make way lor Max
Gumpel, who was to unravel a loup tale
on defects in handwriting. Gumpel did
not go further than to say he was a lith
ographer and an expert in handwriting
when he was withdrawn to launch the
Barry printing episode.
Detective Seymour had snbpenaed
Henry Claussen, a compositor; George S.
Barry, the foreman; and William F.
Barry, the pressman, in the Star printing
establishment, to tell of the printing of
the lac- simiies of the Crocker blanks und
the thermometer prepared to climb.
Barnes was evidently feeling his way
very carefully as he opened the examina
tion. He keDt carefully along the open
roadway, apparently dubious of where he
would bring up in the end.
Claussen had an impediment in his
speech and his testimony was very deliber
ately given. He loid his name, residence
and occupation and the prosecution rested
for a short consultation with youug Fair'a
attorneys.
Then Claussen began by saying that he
had visited several establishments in
printing supplies within a few days in
search of a certain style of type.
"What kind of type was it you desired?"
"A sort ot italic," redied Ciaussen.
"The kind that is used in certificates."
"Did you have the certificate with you
as a sample to compare type with."
Clauisen said he had carried a copy of
the Crocker blank with him in his search.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, T897.
He failed to get the desired type, and a
zincograph of the form was finally made.
Attorney Reddy came to the center
with all sail spread to declare that Claus
sen's testimony had no bearing on the
case. There was a set-to, but Barnes
finally managed to get clear and proceeded
on bis way.
"Where is the zincograph?"
"In Barry's office."
"When was tbis printing done?"
"On Saturday and Monday last?"
Reddy came up again, hammer and
tong?, and demanded a show of hands
from Lees and Barnes.
In reply, the District Attorney said he
would show that Claussen had been mat
ingthe rounds of tie town in search of a
certain kind of typ\ and failing, Barry
had printed about 2000 of the forms
from a zincograph. This lot, continued
Barnes, had been carefully sifted and
sorted, those with a water mark being
laid aside.
"What's this to do with Cooney, any
how?" asked Reddy. "Has not tbe de
endant the right to print blanks to test
the ability of these experts who have been
hired to identify tue Crocker certificate
with the pencil acknowledgments. Time
and time again haven't these experts been
caught in their own trap?"
"But the idea of introducing this evi
dence," continued Reddy, "is not with a
view to connecting it in tbis case, but to
prejudice the people through the newspa
pers against Cooney."
Barnes got clear again and Claussen con
tinued.
"How was this certificate printed?"
"From a zincograph plate."
"Is a zincograph made from a photo
graph?"
"Yes, sir."
"Where is that plate?"
"In the office, I suppose, in charge of
the foreman."
"Did you see delivered the certificates
printed "from this ziucograph?"
"No."
"Do you know how many of these
blanks were printed?"
"I do not.
On croÂ«s-Â«xamination Claussen said he
did not see the printing actually executed.
He read the impression of the piate, and
was satisfied the wording was that of a no
tarial blank. He had first been instructed
to see if the form could not be printed in
other printing houses.
Foreman George 8. Barry added the few
missing details in Claussen's story.
"Did you order the making of that
zincograph?"
"No, sir."
"\Vas it made in your office?"
"No, sir."
"When did you first see it?"
"I think within two weeks. I saw it
for the first time on the composing
stone."
"Did you have anything to do with
printing the blanks from this plate?"
"No; my work ceased when I iocked the
form up and handed it to the pressman. '
Tne zincograph itself got into court
when Barry resumed his story after ihe
noon adjournment.
Attorney Reddy suggested that James
H. Barry, the manager of the priming
house, would be along in a few moments
to facilitate matters by telling who ordered
the job.
"1 can't see what is the idea of putting
this into the record unless it be to assure
the experts that they will not be trapped
unawares," said Reddy. "If the prosecu
tion desire copies of these blanks I in
form them that we have plenty to go
around."
. Barnes called William F., another of the
Barry family, to give the details of the
presswork connected with the reproduc
tion of the blanks.
"How were the forms minted?"
"From a zincograph."
"How many of them did you print?"
"Somewhere in the neighborhood of
1000, I think."
Tne zincograph came in two parts. One
section contained the complete wording of
a notarial blank. Tbe oilier was an etch
ing of the trade mark of H. S. Crocker
that generally appears on the margin of
the forms turned out by that bouse.
Barnes desired to know if the Crocker
etching had been reproduced on the
blanks.
"I don't think it was," replied the
pressman.
"Who gave the order for this printing?"
"My brother, James H. Barry."
They let Pressman Barry go to make
way for Editor Barry, who said he was a
printer and controller of the destinies of
the Star. The attorneys gave the newspaper
man the right of way and he tDld bis
story without interruption.
"About a week ago I received a tele
phone message that Attorney D. M. Dfil
mas desired to see me. I went at once to
nis office and found there the lawyer and
Detective Stilw-ell. One of the Crocker
certificates was produced and I was asked
if 1 could make a fac-simile of it â "
"Never mind what anybody asked you,"
put in Reddy.
"From whom did you get the copy?"
queried Barnes.
"I don't remember just exactly," con
tinued Barry "I don't know either that
any order was given for the work. Mr.
Delmas was not in the office over three
minutes and I oon't think the entire in
terview; consumed five minutes. I had
been in the habit of doing printing for Mr.
Delmas, and I supposed when he asked
me it I omul make a fac-simile of the cer
tificate he wanted it done if possible."
Ready wanted the whole day's proceed
ings struck our. Itcouldir.no way con
cern Cooney if Barry had printed copies
of Crocker forms, for Cooney knew noth
ing about it.
Magistrate Cook was of the same frame
of mind. It would be necessary to show
a knowledge on the part of Cooney of the
transaction.
Foote shied his castor into the ring.
"Suppose," he began, "these blanks had
been printed by others for the purpose of
entrapping these experts â I can see noth
ing that is not legitimate in such a move?
These experts and Crocket's witnesses
have said that they couid identify the
blanK of 1896 wherever they saw a copy of
;t. We have a right to put tuem to the
test."
Reddy branded the whole matter as a
scheme to poison the minds ot tue jury
in advance.
"Tney cannot try the case of Mrs. Craven
against the Fair children here,'" began
Cooney's attorney, "and yet that is wnat
they have been endeavoring to do continu
ally. In this matter they are simply fishing
for evidence that they may use in the civil
suit. This is their methods continually.
Captain Lees has sat here, not as a public
otiicer, but as one interested in maligning
this defense in advance by making state
ments and trying the case in, the newspa
pers in advance, instead of reserving his
evidence, like a public officer, until the
proper time comes to introduce it"
Foote declared that unless District At
torney Barnes could connect Cooney in
soiae way witn the printing of the certifi
cates the record of the transaction had
no business being brought into court.
"If the District Attorney," said Foots,
"will say that ho has of his own knowl
edge information that would connect
Cooney with the affair I for one have no
objection to this story going in the
records. But the District Attorney will
not say this. His knowledge comes in
the way of insinuation from those who
are masquerading behind this criminal
prosecution in the hope of bettering their
chances in coming civil litigation. Del
mas, Stilweil and Cooney say they are
not confederating. What is the purpose
of this evidence? Simply to get a display
in the newspapers in order that Captain
Lees and others may get a reputation for
sagacity."
Barnes declared he believed he could
establish a connection between the print
ing of the blanks and Cooney. at least he
had information that would warrant such
a belief.
Attorney George Knight stepped for
ward and asked to be heard.
"Hello," sa:d Foote, "What's Knight
doin^x in this case?"
Barnes â Mr. Knight is assisting me in
the proscution.
Footeâ Glad to see that Knight's got
into it at last.
Knight â Supposing we show that Del
mas is Cooney'a attorney and has brought
two suits in the civil courts in behalf of
his client for $200,000?- Supposing we
show that Delrnas is Cooney's confiden
tial adviser and that this is the first case
in which be has not appeared for him,
apparently ior the reason tnat he is try
ing to get out from under falling timber?
Supposing we establish the relation of at
torney and client existing between them?
Would not these be links in the case
we are trying to establish here? The
District Attorney knew yesterday that the
printers fiom Barry's had been searching
the town for type and that an evident at- I
tempt was made to reproduce, to counter
feit, these Crocker blanks. Why forge
the name of H. S. Crocker & Co. to a blank
printed elsewhere? Why commit a mis
demeanor? Does not this smell of fog?
Does not this stink of crime? We must
prove our case step by step. We must
prove in the legal chain that Deima's and
Stiiwell ordered these blanks under cir
cumstances that would show they might
be used in a manner not in harmony with
justice."
Foote in reply proceeded to rate Knight
with grapeshot.
"Supposing you do show,'' he began,
"that Delmas and Stiiwell ordered these
blanks, what has that to do with the case?
It's no argument to say a thing smacks of
crime or smells of fog. I wouid like to
know who told Knight the name of
Crocker is printed on the Barry blanks ?
Where did he get that information? How
does ne know this unless he has been
guilty of petty larceny and taken some of
them wi;... out* the knowledge of their own
ers? What is the District Attorney floun
dering .t in this manner in this case
for? What are these d tectives and Cap
tain Lees doinp in this case when they
might better be attending to the worK
they are paia for by the City? Why don't
they attend to their duties instead of
working for the Fair millions? It's not
the people of California, bu' Charles L.
Fair that is prosecuting this case, solely
in the hopa thai he may better iiis case in
the civil courts, and that other witnesses
for Mrs. Craven and her deeds may be in
timidated."
Reddy and Foote denied that they knew
anything of the printing of the blanks
until told so by the prosecution. Magis
trate Cook reserved a decision in the
matter of admitting the day's proceedings
into the record, and peace was restored
when Editor Barry was allowed to retire.
The case will be resumed Monday.
EITHER CITY MAY
GET THE FIGHT
Stuart's Advance Repre
sentative, Wheelock,
in Town.
Respective Claims of Carson and
Reno to Be Considered
Later.
William Kenyon Wheelock, a con
spicuous figure m the world of sport and
the advance representative of Dan Stuart,
the famous right promoter, who is at
present busily engaged in arranging the
preliminaries of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons
contest, arrived here yesterday afternoon
from Carson, Nev., where he has been
working hard in the interest of the bill to
license glove contests in that State.
When interviewed yesterday at the
Palace Hotel Mr. Wheelock expressed the
pleasure he felt at the passage of this
measure, which has now received the sig
nature of Governor Sadler and so become
law.
"The sentiment in Nevada," said Mr.
Wheelock, "I found most liberal. The
people over there seem to appreciate the
fact that the holding of these glove con
tests in the State is calculated to promote
the influx of a large quantity of Hard cash,
for the patrons of the ring are justly cele
brated as liberal spenders."
"Is it definitely settled that the fiÂ£Â»ht
will be pulled off in Nevada? ' was asked.
"Mr. Stuart," was the reply, "has de
cided that the Fitzsimmons-Corbett battle
will take place in the Sagebrush State. 1
have carefully examined the ground my
self and have located training quarters at
suitable hot springs near Reno and Car
son. Slaughter and Steamboat Springs,
in particular, ere admirably adapted lor
such a purpose, and the weather in Ne
vada during March is said to be all that
could be desired and in every respect suit
able for outdoor work. Both Corbett and
Fitz have b en notified by wire that they
may begin the work of training right
away and that every facility in that direc
tion will be afforded. They have not re
plied as yet, but I expect word any mo
ment that they are on their way to Ne
vada."
"Which city, in your opinion, would be
the best location for the fight?"
"The contest," replied Mr. Wheelock,
"will be held in the city whose offer proves
the more alluring. Mr. Stuart will hear
what Reno and Carson have to say and
will make a personal inspection of the
ground before finally determining on the
location of the battle-ground. As to pas
senger rates to the scene of hostilities, I
have been in communication with some of
the railway officials, and thoutrh nothing
definite has yet been decided, I anticipate
no difficulty whatever in the way of secur
ing round-trip tickets to a point nearest
the ringside at greatly reducea figures.
Mr. Stuart will lose no time in visiting
Nevada on his tour of inspection^in fact.
I expect him up right away, and as I said
before I have advised the two principals
to come West immediately so that no
hitches are likely to occur.
"I wish to have it distinctly understood,
moreover, that all talk to ttfe effect that
Carson or any other place is certain to
secure the fight is all nonsense and empty
speculation. There is c good deal of
jealousy between Carson and Reno, and
each would like to convey the impression
that the mill is sure to come off in its
neighborhood. Bat we haven't committed
ourselves, and don't propose to do so yet."
The question of forfeit money or side
bets is one with which Mr. Wheelock has
nothing to do.
DEATH CAME UNHERALDED
Prentiss Selby of the Big Smell
ing Firm Stricken
Down.
He Had Been Apparently in Fair
Health and His End Came
as a Shcck.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 30.â Another
prominent man has been taken oft' with
out warning. Late last nieht Prentiss
Selby was suddenly stricken down at his
resilience, 1360 Madison street, and in a
few minutes he was dead.
For some time past Mr. Sflby has been
suffering from various maladies, none of
which, however, were serious, and there
was no thought that his end was near;
Last evening he was apparently in very
good health, but by midnight he was
seized with a fainting spell, which re
sulted fataliy.
Mr. Selby was the leading partner in the
Selby Smelting Works of this city. He
entered the employ of the works years ago
as a founder soon after he came to this
coast from the East. He worked up from
that obscure position to be a leader and a
stockholder in the company.
During his life Mr. Selby, while always
a prominent man, was never connected
with any public ofhce, and he had but lit
tle to do with politics. He was essentially
a homebody, and his house was one of the
most attractive in Oakland. He leaves a
widow and six children, all of whom are
leaders in Oakland society.
As to the wealth of deceased it is esti
mated that his estate will amount to sev
eral hundred thousand dollars. He was
50 years old.

beginning of his lons illness he had kept
a coffin in his bedroom; that the casket
was prepared for burial and that in it was
sufficient money for the funeral expenses.
Mrs. Faust, it was stated, had been par
tially paralyzed for years, and her coffin
also had been kept in the house beside
that of her husband.
It appears, now, that The Call was in
error in stating that the coffins had been
in the house for a period of three years.
The two coffins were -boupht from James
Taylor, an undertaker in Oakland, on the
22d day of August, 1896, and shipoed by
order of H. W. Faust, to Monterey, Cal.,
where they were stored in a barn some 600
or more feet away from the house.
It is not true that there was money kent !
in the coffins for the purpose of burial. It
is true, however, that ttie names bf PhiliD
Faust and Mary Faust appeared on the
plates of the coffins, wiih the dates of
their birth. It is also true that the coffins
ivere not shown to either Mr. or Airs.
Faust.
It was held oat by the physician that
Mr. Faus: might die at any time, and it
was also feared that Mrs. Faust would die
from the shock whicli his death would
produce, she being in a paralyzed condi
tion. The precaution was, therefore,
taken of purchasing the two caskets in
August, although the death of Mr. Faust
did not occur until December 21, while
Mrs. Faust is still alive.
OEUELTY CONDONED.
Judge Hunt Withholds Â« IMvorce Where
Suit Was Long; Delayed.
Mrs. Fiorinda Thomas will hare to Ret
along as a married woman for a while, or
at least nntil she can offer sufficient proof
to convince Judee Hunt that she is en
titled !o a divorce from William Henry
Thomas.
When Mrs. Thomas' casa was called for
trial it was found that her health was bo
much impaired that she was unable to
appear in curt. Nevertheless the lady's
deposition was read in support of her de
rcand for it legal separation.
In Mrs. Thomas" deposition she alleged
that in 1881, at the time of the birth of her
last baby, he drove from the house t-everal
ladies who had offered to care for her; that
she was left alone with her little one and
that it died. Two days later her husband
returned.
She was asked how she obtained fool
and other necessaries during those two
days, to which she replied tnat she had to
get up out of bed and procure for herself
the things that she needed.
Mrs. J. Schreiber testified that she was
one of the women driven out of the
Thomas home at the time of tne birth of
the child that died. She thought Thomas
was exceedingly harsh, and Mrs. Thomas
had often complained of his bad treat
ment.
Judge Hunt said he was in donbo in re
gard to the matter, and asked when Mrs.
Thomas and her husband bad ceased to
live together as man and wife. On being
informed that they had maintained
marital relations until a short time ago,
he remarked that this made the difficulty
all the greater.
"The fact that Mr?. Thomas lived with
her husband for about sixteen years aftÂ°r
nis alleged cruelty raises 9. strong pr*
sumptien of condohement. and I could
not see my way clear to granting the re
lief asked for without bearing sufficient
testimony on behalf of the plaintiff to
overthrow that presumption and explain
the cause of her long delay in suing for a
divorce."
Accordingly the case was continued un
til Mrs. Thomas is able to appear and tes
tify. V
