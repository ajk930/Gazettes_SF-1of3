LONDON, E\Â«., May 15.â The power?
pre waiting with what patience they may
until it shell please the Sultan to say
* hat he is going to do about the overtures
for peace in behalf of Greece. In the
meantime the latter has established a
foothold in Epirus, which will enable her
to say that Greek troops are occupying
Turkish territory, even if all of Thesialy
is given over to the invaders.
The situation, however, is far from sat
isfactory to the powers, and least of all to
England, who has been euchered and dis
comfited at every turn in the great game
of diplomacy in which the war has been
only one of th<s moves. It is well known
that Salisbury is anxious for peace at the
earliest possible moment and in favor of
a vigorous control of the Sultan. It is
quite safe to say that the .British Premier
w ill- be disappointed.
f.ere is no indication that Russia and
Germany are in any great hurry, and it ia
â¦ erfai tbÂ« niVka wm snap his fingers ai
any other attempt to interfere with him.
It is quite probable the Czar, and perhaps
Kuiporor Wil iam also, will prefer that
Greece be reduced to a much humbler atti
tude than &hb now occupies. Athens
threatened and at the mercy of the Turks
would enable Russia to play the same role
she did for China at the close of the
Japanese war and at the same price. It
would even be possible â in fact if not in
nameâ for Russia to gain the same ascend
ency in Greek affairs as England has done
iv Egypt. The only power which wonli
seriously resent this would be Great Brit
ain, and her cowardice is now universally
recogn izea as one of the permanent factors
in the European situation. Her protests
might be noisy, but there would be no
guns behind them.
Salisbury and Balfonr are fond of de
claring themse.ves real friends of Greece.
It is perfectly clear to-day that this friend
ship is of no more value to Greece than
that of Salisbury's favorite setter. Eng
land might as well be wi; bout a voice in
dealing with Turkey at the present mo
ineni, as she is so impotent. In impend
ing negotiations she will be outwitted ai
every point, and the only resource she
thinks she Has gained is better relations
with France, about which she is already
boasting. But any attempt at present to
turn this advantage to practical use w.U
be certain to bring her nothing but hu
miliation. The French may be fickle, biu
any attempt to transfer tbeir affections
over night from St. Petersburg to London
would furnish the most grotesque specta
cle of modern politics.
Kint; George's real help must come
from St. Petersburg and will come assoon
as he is ready to pay the price. This
pries will include Russian control ol
Greek finances in some form and through
this dominant Russian influence over tne
Greek Government.
If England does not like it she can pro
test. Nobody is afraid she will do any
thing more. It is premature and useless
to discuss terms of peace before the Porte
has even consented to an armistice. The
various claims Turkey has cabled during
the week are little more tnan feelers to
test opinion.
A peculiar feature of the news of the
so-called war which has now gone on
nearly a month is that it is almost impos
sible to gain even an approximate idea of
the loss of life in the various battles and
skirmishes. An examination of the great
mass of material by mail and telegraph
which has come to London from all
sources enables me to make a rough esti
mate, for which no pretensions of accuracy
are claimed. The number of Greeks
killed in the Thessaly campaign previous
to the battles near Pharsala will probably
not exceed 1000. The last ten days brings
the loss up to about 1800. The first in
vasion of Epirus didn't cost many lives.
Yesterday's battle was more serious, but
tne total loss in the Epirus campaign is
hardly more than 900. The total of Greek
Josses is probably Detween 2500 and 3000.
There are almost no figures on the Turk
ish side. The Turks themselves don't
know their own losses. They are pro
verbially indifferent about such statistics.
Taking all the available evidence, I am

inclined to believe the total actually
killed in battle on both sides is less than
5000 men.
OFFER TO CAPITULATE.
Turks at Prevesa Reported to Be

ATHENS, Greece, May 15â It U re
ported that the Turks at Prevesa have of
fered to capitulate. The Greek western

one of the lonian islands, 2000 women and
cniklren wbo were picked up alone the
coasts of Epirus while fleeing from the
Turkish soldiers. The fate of thousands
of other women and children is unknown.
A dispatch from Dhomoko aays Crown
Prince Constantino is sulking in the house
in which he has established his headquar

troops.
The foreign admirals commanding the
international fleet in Cretan waters have
informed the Cretans that Greece has
abandoned her policy of a union of the
island with Greece. They have renewed
the promise of the powers to establish an
autonomous government for Crete.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, May 15.
The belief is entertained here that the
Turkish Government will demand a recti
fication of the Greek frontier and a revi
sion of the treaties with Greece, together
with the payment of a war indemnity
of Â£16,000,000, Turkish. Placards have
been posted throughout the city protest
ing against the further shedding of blood,
upon the ground that the sacrifice: im
posed upon Turkey are vastly in excess of
any advantages she may gain from the
war with Greece.
QUADRUPLE MEXICAN TRAGEDY.
Youth of Sevenieen Slays Four Men Who
Oppose His Courtship and Finally
Elopes With the Girl.
BAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 15.â Harry
K. Bridgeman, an American stockman
hying near Monclova, Mexico, arrived
here to-day with news of a quadruple
tragedy on the Hacienda del Cedral, near
his ranch. Macedonio Fraunto, a 17-year
old boy, was enamored of Anita Mojas,
the pretty daughter of a ranchman. The
family of the girl opposed the marriage,
and Frausto determined to get possession
of her by force. He armed himself with a
rifle and started for tier burnt. On the
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, MAT 16, 1897â THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
roaa he met Manuel Solis, manager of the
hacienda, and the girl's brother. The boy
and the two men quarreled, and Frausto
deliberately shot and killed them both.
Another brother of the girl arrived on the
scene, and he also was promptly shot and
killed. Before the boy got away from the
scene Manual Horrera came up and at
tempted his capture. Horrera was also
killed. The murderer then proceeded to
the girl's home. They eloped and have
not yet been captured.
GIGANTIC FINANCIAL SCHEME.
Capital ot $100,000,000 and a Business
Capacity of $2,000,000,000â 800n
to the farmers.
NEW YORK, N V., May 15.â The Press
says: There has been projected in this
city thegreatest financial institution of the
world. It is the establishment of a credit
company under Federal supervision on
the plan of the Credit Foncier of Francp,
but with greater powers. Lawyer John
Dos Passos has the charter in his posses
sion, and says it will be submitted to
Congres-t within the next two weeks. He
claims he has leceived the approval of the
administration and leaders in Congress.
News of the undertaking came from
Washington to-day, Out most of the Re
publican leaders denied that they had
been consulted in reference to it.
The company as planned is to have a
capital of $100,000,000, with the privilege
of doing a business of $2,000,000,000.
Among the financiers mentioned in con
nection with the project are C. N. Jordan,
J. Pierpont Morgan and Henry O. Have
meyer. The company's prime purpose is
to lend money to farmers, especially of
the West and South, at a rate almost half
of that which they are now paying.
The system upon which the institution
is to be mnna.ed is similar to that upon
which tha Credit Foncier is managed, but
improvements are planned based upon
tho principles of the best-known and most
successful National building and loan as
sociations.
In addition, the charter will authorize
the company to do a general trust and
banking business within well-defined
limits, the object of this branch being to
give farmers short loans on their crops.
The saving in interest charges to the bor
rowing portion of the country is put at
$100,000,000 a year.
The most important immediate effect of
the chartering and operation of the new
institution is expected to be tne wane of
the power of Wall street.

[Copyrighted 1897 by the New York Bna.]
LONDON, Eng., May 15.â 1t is impos
sible any longer to ignore the shameful
facts regarding the cowardly brutality of
men who saved themselves at the expense
of women at the Paris bazaar fire.
Every woman who escaped has the
same story to tell, and the Paris press,
which kept Bileut a week while the miser
able truth was in private circulation, is
now compelled to deal with the subject
openly. Certulus, the magistrate who in
vestigated the tragedy, says he examined
scores of women survivors, the soie object
being to ascertain tne cause of the caias-
trophe. Every moment, however, wit
nesses would break out in abuse of the
men who left them in the lurch or bru
tally impeded their fli.:ht.
The names of prominent and aristo
cratic cowards are freely used in private
converse and there is more than one man
who stood in the highest circles of Paris
who will never be admitted to drawing
rooms again. Tbere are plenty of au
thentic examples. A well-known lady
shows her arms to friends. "Look at these
marks," she exclaims; "they were made
by the stick of a man who pushed me
aside in order that he might pass."
The wife of an artist got sway, thanks
to a man who proceeded at such a rate,
forcing his way through crowds of women,
whom he trampled on, that he reached
the street. The lady kept behind him and
effected an exit. One young woman was
beyond the reach of the flames at the
door. A man passed and although in no
danger struct her so violently on the
cnest that she is now in bed seriously ill.
Another lady was thrown down. She
raised her head and held out her hands.
A man, fearing she might clutch him,
kicked her. One young lady, who is now
dying, was standing near a ladder thar
had been let down by the staff of the
Croix newspaper, by which 100 persons
were saved. A man to make her let go
of the ladder struck her a blow on the
hand with a walking-stick, breaking all
her fingers. "I must add," says the wit
ness, "that she was clinging to the ladder
paralyzed with terror, unable to advance,
and preventing those behind her from
saving themselves."
Banker Fould, whose wife was injured,
says two men whose names he knows
passed his, wife, and one dealt her a blow
in the face. Only about thirty men pres
ent at the fire perished. Six were injured.
All the latter were burned while saving
lives.
The cause of the fire is explained by the
man in charge of the kinematrograph.
Finding the lamp not sufficiently charged
he was about to pour in ether. He lit a
match to see what he was doing and the
vapor caught fire and the entire receiver
burst into fames, which spread to the
hangings forming the bazaar decorations.
Most of the rescues, including many o!
the most heroic, were performed by men
of the humbler classes, who happened to
be passing. Many times it has been said
in Paris this week that if a fire under like
conditions had occurred in the work
men's districts there would have been far
fewer deaths.
RUSSIA'S RAILWAY HORROR.
Cause of the Wreck in Which One Hun
dred Soldiers Were Killed and
Sx y Injured.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, May 15.â
Further particulars of the wrecking of a
military train on the Volk-Dorjew railway
yesterday, by which 100 men were killed
and sixty injured, show that the disaster
was due to the sinking of the track in con
sequence of a sudden flood.
When the truin reached a weak part of
the track it was derailed, and the cars were
piled on top of one another. As the train
left tha track many soldiers jumped into
the water and were drowned. All the cars
were broken to pieces.
PURSUING THE TRAIN-ROBBERS.
Texas Rangers Join the Officers â Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s Loss Kr.twn to Be
at Least $10,000,
BAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 15â The
three men who held up the Southern Pa
cific train and robbed the sale of Wells,
Fargo <fc Co.'s Ex press Company near
Lozier are being pursued by Texas range's
and a posse of Denuty Sheriffs. The trail
of the robbers heads toward ih â¢ Rio
Grand*, and the fugitives are believed to
be in the Mexican mountains.
One of the robbers' pals pave the local
official full information of the plot a few
weeks ago, but he suddenly disappeared
and may have been killed for his treach
ery to his fellow-plotters. The express
company is not yet through checking up
its waybills, and refuses to make a definite
statement regarding the amount of money
the robbers secured. It is Known that
the through safe contained not less than
$10,000, and may have been many times
that, as heavy shipments of money are
made daily between New Orleans and San
Francisco.
Lozier is a lonely station in a desolate
part of Texas. Miss Aildie Upton, the
telecraph operator there, says the three
robbers entered the station just before the
train was due and ordered her to stop thÂ«
train for them. She replied tbat such an
order was useless, as the train stopped
anyway.* She then wired the train dis
patcher that she believed the train was
going to be robbed. Her warning was too
late, however, as the train had already
passed the last station to 1/ozier.
CIVIL SERVICE LAW INQUIRY.
Public Printer Pa mer Tells of I. a Em-
barrassmg Operations in the Gov
ernment Office.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 15.â At a
meeting to-day of the Senate committee
investigating the workings of the civil
service law in the last ail tniaisi ration
Postoffice Auditor George A. Howard de
fended himself against charge*" of favor
itism and violation of the civil service
law.
Public Printer Palmer told the commit
tee he had found, durinp the interval of
bis absence from the Government Print
ing office, that many of the most excel
lent workmen had been relieved. Palmer
complained that he could not appoint his
own cashier, who handled between $3,000,
--000 and $4,000,000 annually and gave no
bond to the Government, while he him
self was practically under $200,000 bond.
Senator Lodge favored maintaining the
printing office under civil service rules,
but he thought it absurd to call a stable
man a boy who carries forms, a char
woman a watchman or a doorkeeper a
akilled laborer.
Commissioner Proctor and several other
witnesses testified, after -.vbirh the com
mittee adjourned for one week.
BROOKLYN DRY DOCK LEAKS.
Not So Serious as to Prevent the Gleaning
of the Maine â Hilborn Consults
Commodore Matthews.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 15.âAdmi
ral Bi'nce, commandant of the Brooklyn
Navy-yard, reported to the Navy Depart
ment to-day that drydock No. 2, which
developed a leak last Thursday, was not
in a serious condition and could be used
for docking purposes. Orders were sent
immediately to dock tha Maine, in order
that she could be cleaned.
In the ab-ence of Chairman BouteHe,
Hilborn of Cali ornia, ranking member of
the House Committee on Naval Affairs,
has been consulting Commodore Matth
ews, chief of tl'.e bureau of yards and
docks, about the leaks in two drydocka of
the Brooklyn yard. The commodore was
anxious that the appropriation be made
for the repair of the docks, bat Hilborn
advised that nothing be done until the
board now examining the leaks has com
pleted its investigations.
WILL MOVE TO THE COUNTRY.
President McKmley and Secretary Porter
Will Get Some Relief From
Office- Seekers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 15.â The
President will probably move his house
hold from the Executive Mansion to a
home in the country, to remain during
the early gammer months or until Con
jsress adjourns. Then he will occupy Em
bassador John Hays' New Ensland sea
side residence. The place in view is a
typical Virginia country house, situated
two miles from Arlington on the Virginia
hills. It belong* to ex-S:nator Hender
son of Missouri, who tendered the house
to the President.
Secretary Porter and family will ac
company the President, but will occupy a
smaller house close by, and he as well as
Mr. McKmley will escape the annoyance
of office-seekers and others except during
stated hours each day. They will come
into town each morning on the electric
cars and return in the afternoon.

partment, to-day from Commander Elmer
of iha cruiser Marblehead, recently sent
to Puerto Cortez, Honduras, to protect
American interests, saying tne revolution

the Ceremonies.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 15.â With
one hand in the air, as if asking a mo
ment's quiet from the multitude, and the
other on a cord which held the draperies
about the top of the Washington monu
ment , President McKinley this afternoon
unveiled the statue dedicated to the
memory of the Nation's father. Tens of
thousands of spectators watched the
President.
The first event of the day was the firing
of a salute at sunrise by batteries of United
States regulars camping in Fairmount
Park. At 9 o'clock the committee of the
Mi.itary Order of Foreign Wars called on
the President at the Hotel vValton, pre
senting him with the insignia of the
society. The President tnanked the com
mittee in a few words and immediately
afterward left the hotel for a two hours'
drive about the city.
In the meantime the troops were form
ing for the parade with the marines from
the French frigate Fulton, the United
States battle-ship Texas and monitor
Terror. The proces ; ion marched up
Broid street to the entrance of the park,
where the monument is situated.
Here the President reviewed the pro
cession. About him were members of
the Cabinet, city and State otlicera,
members of the Society of the Cincinnati
and distinguished guests.
The President was escorted to the
scene of the ceremonies by the City Troop.
The ceremonies at the monument began
at 2 o'clock, when Bishop Whitaker
delivered a prayer.
This was followed by an address by
Major William Wayne, president of the
State and general societies of the Cin
cinnati. The President then pulled a
cord, unveiling the figure of Washington.
This was the signal tor the firing of the
National salute by war-vessels in the
Delaware and artillery. The President
then delivered his address. The Presi
dent said :

and tender sentiment connected with this
memorial. It expresses not only the
gratituto and reverence of the living, but
is a testimonial of affection and homage
from the dead. Comrades of Washington
projected this monument. Their love in
spired it. Their contributions helped to j
build it. Tne past and present share its
completion, and future generations will
profit by its lessons.
"To participate in the dedication of
such a mon ument is a rare end prec.ous i
privilege. Every monument to Washing- j
ton is a tribute to patriotism. Every ]
status and shaft to bis memory helps to
inculcate the love for country, toencour- j
ape loyalty and establish better citizen- |
ship. God bless every undertaking which j
revives patriotism and rebukes the indif- j
ferent and lawless. A critical study of j
Washington's career only enhances our !
estimation of fiis vast and varied abilities, i
"A3 commander-in-chief of the Colonial ;
armies from the beginning of the war to
tha proclamation of peace, as president of :
the convention which framed the consti
tulion ol the United States and the first
President of tbe United States under that
constitution, Washington has the dis
tinction of differing from all other j
illustrious Americans. No other name j
bears or can bear such a relation to the ;
Government. Not only by bis military j
geniusâ his patience, sagacity, courai?e ;
and skillâ was our National independence j
won, but he helped in the largest measure |
to draft the chart by which the Nation'
was guided and he was ihe first chosen of j
the people to put in motion the new gov- i
eminent.
"His was not a boldness of martial dis
play or charm of captivating oratory, but [
his calm and steady judgment won men's j
fupportand commanded their confidence j
ly appealing to their best and noblest as- |
p:rations. And withal, Washineton was \
ever so modest that in no time of bis ca
reer did be personally seem intrusive. !
He was above temptation's rower. He
spurned a suggested crown. He would ;
have no honor wfcicu the people did not !
Destow.
"An interesting fact, and one which I |
love to recall, is that tne only time Wash
ington formally addressed the constitu
tional convention during all its session?
over which he presided in this city he !
appealed for a lamer representation of i
ihe people in the National House of Rep- j
resentauves, and his appeal was instantly '
i;eeiled. Thus was he ever keenly watch- j
iul of the rights of the people in whose !
lianas was the destiny of our Government '
then and now.
"Most masterful were his military cam- i
pa:gns, but bis civil administration com- !
raands equal udmiration. His foresight !
was marvelous. His conception of tbe j
philosophy of government, his insistence
upon the necessity of education, morality ;
and enlightened citizenship, to the prog- |
ress and permanence of tbe republic, can
not be contemplated even at this period !
without filling us with astonishment at j
the breadth of his comprehension and
sweep of his vision.
"His was no narrow view of govern- I
rnent. The immediate present was not
his sole concern, but our future good his
constant theme and study. He blazed
the path of liberty. He laid the founda
tion upon which we have grown from a
weak and scattered colonial Government j
to the United States, whose domain and ;
power, as well as whose liberty and free- I
dom have become the admiration of the !
world. Distance and time have not de
tracted from the fame and force of his
achievements, or diminished tbe grandeur :
of his life and work. Great deeds do not j
stop in their growth, and those of Wash- I
ington will expand in their influence ia j
all centuries to iohow.
"The bequest Washington has made to j
civilization is rich beyond computation, j
The obligations under which be has
placed mankind are sacred and command
ing. The responsibility he has left for
the American people to preserve and per
fect what he accomplished is exacting and
solemn. Let us rejoice in every new cvi- |
dence that the people realize what they !
enjoy, and cherish with affection the {
illustrious heroes of revolutionary stock,
whose valor and sacrifices made us a Na- j
tion. They live in us, and their memory !
will help us to keep the covenant entered i
into for the maintenance of the freest
Government of the earth.

The decorations throughout the city
were lavish. The Presidential party fol
i lowed the procession under the escort of
â  the City Troop. It was tendered an ova
j tion. After tfce ceremonies were over the
President and party were driven to the
j train for Washington. Tlie remainder of
! the distinguished guests attended the So
! ciety of tbe Cincinnati banquet at the
j Union L?ague to-night.
When the movement for the monument
i was siarted in ISIO by the Society of tbe
i Cincinnati that organization had not yet
â  acquired its peculiar distinction as an or
ganization of patriots of opulence and
leisure dedicated to the worship of their
ancestry. They were not unlike the
legions which have grown out of the late
Civil War, and Washington was as near
to them as Grant still is near to us.
They began with the purpose of raising
about $150,000, but the war of 1612, with
as two years of excitement and the hard
times which followed, caused a temporary
suspension of the movement. More than
seventy years ago some Philadelphians,
who were disposed to be faster and less
conservative thau the Society of the Cin
cinnati, besran to raise complaints. When
Lafayette came to the city the absence of
any monument of Washington was re
garded as a matter of reproach.
In the outburst of patriotism at tbat
time a committee of citizens proceeded to
raise a new fund, which was soon iorgot
ten, but which was revived in 1832, when
the one hundredth anniversary of Wash
ington's bir>h produced another revival of
patriotic memories. A great procession
was organized i:i honor of this centen
nial; and in the aivition given up to
trades was a car drawn by seven horses
and carrying the cornerstone which the
stonecutters had prepared lor the Wash
iiigton monument.
Again the uext year there was a great
parade and the cornerstone was laid in
the center of Washington square within
sight of the venerated Independence Hall.
Year alter year auu decide niter decaÂ«Je
went by and the soil which was laid over
the coiner^one was not disturbed. Now
and then there was some ta.k of a "de
sign."
The original fund of 1810 in tbe custody
of the Cincinnati bed remained undis
turbed in all these years. The citizens'
fund of 1824 and 1832 was also substan
tially intact in the care of Charles Chaun
cey. They had at the beginning asked
tae Cincinnati to unite their fund with
tne Coauncey fund, but the request was
denied. It was in 1858 that John Sartain,
together with Joseph R. Ingersoll, Joseph
Harrison and others, entered into a move
ment for tbe consolidation of "Hue two
funds, but they mci \j much opposition
tnatjthe projectors abandoned it in disgust
The Society of the Cincinnati would meet
once a year and solemnly pass resolutions.
At last, about fifteen years ago, they
went into court and asked for the Chaun
cey fund. Alexander Purvis of the Phila
delphia Saving Society iiad invested it so
carefully mat it amounted to $50,000. O.i
trie other hand, there had been not less
prudent husbandry of the Cincinnati fund.
It bad swollen to about $130,000. The
union of tLe-e funds forms the treasury
in which bus been accumulated the money
for tne payment of the monument now
awaiting dedication at a cost of more t&an
$200,000.
Now, while the old cornerstone is in its
place, the teautiful structure of to-day,
entirely different from tne ideas or those
who oiiginated the scheme elghty-s:x
years ago, adorns the park. The monu
ment is the most magmticent and costly,
with the single exception of the tall shaft
at Washington, ever erected to the mem
ory of the Father of His Country. The
monument is 44 feet high. The equestrian
figure of Washington stands 20 feet above
the pedestal, wnich is 17 by 30 feet, and
rises from a platform 61 by 74 feet, reached
by thirteen steps, symbolical of the thir
teen original States. The cost of the
monument was $250,000. The platform
and pedestal are of green and pink Swed
ish granite, the pedestal being beautifully
polished, and the statue, figures, bas
reliefs and other ornaments are of bronze.

REMARKABLE MURDER TRIAL
Close of One of ifie Most Interesting Cases
in Oklahoma's H.sory â Conviction
of Dr. Stuisman.
WICHITA, Kans., May 15.â The Stuts
man murder trial, just closed at Oklahoma
City, O. T., in which the jury returned a
verdict of guilty, sentencing the defend
ant to a life term in the penitentiary, is
one that attracted more attention than
any of the many murder cases that have
burdened the criminal dockets of Okla
homa.
In the trial of the case 180 witnesses
were subpenaed, and the best legal talent
of the Territory fought hard for a week
for the slightest advantageous point
towaid a conviction or acquittal. Horace
Speed of Guthrie, formerly United States
District Attorney for Oklahoma, led the
defense, assisted by H. B. Mitchell of Okla
homa City and W. F. Horn, formerly
United States special agent for the In
terior Department. Judge Brown of Ok
lahoma City, probably the shrewdest
criminal lawyer of the Territory, was the
chief counsel for the prosecution. He was
aided by Lon Chambers of Oklahoma City
and County and Attorney Biackley of
Pottowatomie County.
The history of this famous case is this:
On the night of July 11, 1896, Aaron Han
ing, a prosperous saloon-keeper of Keokuk
Falis, was murdered in his saloon. He
baa been shot through the head. When
found the next morning he was still living,
but died that afternoon without regaining
consciousness. The doctors, in probing,
found that the probe traveled from the
point of the bullet's entrance in two differ
ent directions. This was explained by the
finding in the saloon of a long nail, par
tially stained with blood, which had evi
dently beenuÂ«ea to complete the dastardly
deed that the assassin's bullet had lelt in
complete. The murderer, as was after*
wards proved, had inserted the nail into
the wound and stirred up the victim's
drains to make sure of his job.
The most untiring of Keokufc Falls'
citizens in endeavoring to locate the mur
derer was Dr. Nicholas Stutsman. Through
his efforts several arrests or men suspected
of the crime were made, but each arrest
proved wrong and the auspect was turned
loose.
Finally a farmer â Sam Bartellâ who had
had considerable experience with crime
and criminals through long service as
Deputy United States Marshal, became
interested in the case and soon developed
clews i ointing toward the guilt of btuts
man himself. The evidence was purely
circumstantial and weafc at first, but each
clew when followed to an end placed the
crime of Haning's murder more sarely at
tilulsman's door.
At length all questions were settled by
the statement of Smtsraan's wife that
Stntsman had confessed the killing to her
and had also named as his accomplice S.
Howard, who was then Incarcerated in
be Fort Smith (Ark.) United States Jail.
In the meantime Mrs. Scutsmau had left
her husband.
A meetine was arranged between How
ard ana Mrs. S'.utsruan, and upon her
telling him that her husband had told
her all he also confessed. Here was a
moral certainty that Stulsman had killed
Han ing, but balked by the rule of law
that a wife cannot testify against her
husband the confession was worth noth
ing. No one wag a witness to the killing,
and the conviction, if secured, had to be
on circumstantial evidence of a doubtful
character.
The horse's tracks found leading from
the saloon corresponded to the tracks of
Howard's horse. The tracks led south for
a mile, then returned and disappeared at
the home of Moneypenny, one of the men
wqo had been arrested at the instance oi
Stutsman. Stutsman went to bed Jate that
night, but wns up at daybreak next morn
ing and the fact was shown that he was
invariably a late sleeper. Stutsman's re
volver the day after the killing was found
to have five corroded shells and one empty
shell. Later it was found that the empty
shell w*3 replaced with a new one.
Stntsman endeavored to bribe Mrs.
Hossy and her son, at whose house
Moneypennv staved the night of the kill
ing until 4 o'clock in the morning, to
swear that Moneypenny departed be
tween 1 and 2 o'clock. Stutsman was the
tirst to discover the murdered Haning by
entering the rear door of the saloon early
the next mornine. He was seen by a
little girl to enter the saloon, and she
swore that he remained there at least fif
teen minutes b More he returned and gave
the alarm.
The tueory of tbe prosacution was that
then was when the nail was pushed into
ii:'. nine's brain. Before the murder
Stutsman had tried to induce a young
man named Freeman to propose to
Moneypenny to steal his (Stutsman's)
hor-es the nijiht of July 1; to let him
(Stuts-man) know the road to be taken,
and ii)at ne would follow them, arrest
ihem, and that by the boy Freeman turn
ing (State's evidence, ho would, through
Stutsman's influence, be turned loose and
Moneypenny would be sent to the peni
tcntiarv; Stutsman staling that he be
lieved Moneypenny was a horsethief, and
he wanted to catch him in the act.
Stutsman's horses wore in a barn, the
next door to Haning's sa>oon. Freeman
refused the proposition. Had he accepted
and undertaken the act he and .Money
nenny would have been banged by Judee
Lynch's edict, and, justice apparently sat
isfied, the real murderer would nave gone
unscathed.
The bullet found in Haning's head was
proved to fit Stuisman's revolver; but this
proved nothing, as in KeoKuk Falls and
vicinity, beinÂ« known as "Oklahoma's
Hell Hole," every one went armed, num
bers having Eruns exactly similar to Stuts
man's. The above, with a number of
minor circumstances, was the proseiu
ton's case.
To complicate matters one of the prin
cipal witnesses for the Territory, Jap
Henry, who had hear! a portion of How
ard's confession to Mrs. Btutsman, be
came the paramour of Mrs. Stutsman.
Mrs. Stutsman is a very beautiful woman
and since leaving her husband has dritte i
to the bad. The affaire d'amour crew so
public that the de e:i-e had no trouble in
securing plenty of evidence of their con
duct, and the prosecution's objection to
the introduction of evidence of the im
proper relations between Henry and Mrs.
iSnusman was overruled.
The attorney for the defense cited the
case of King David, who coveted the wife
of Uriah, showing Henry'sinterest. in con
victing Stntsman. The defense was short,
Stutsman not going on the stand, they
relying on their severe cross-examination
of the prosecution's witnesses. The jury
was out but a short time, returning a ver
dict of suilty.
Dr. Stut-man came to Oklahoma from
Sedan, Kans., where he lived for ten or
twelve years. He has the reputation of
being what is called a "bad man," but a
man who fights square. He has been shot
"all to pieces" upon several occasions and
has "killed his man," in fact several of
them.
He is rather small, thin cheeked and
lip'.ieil. He is an intelligent, well-in
formed person, and one witu wiiom it is a
pleasure to talk. He has many warm
iriends and as many warm enemies.
Many of the latter would have slept un
easily for years had he been acquitted.
Tne officers had taken every precaution
to prevent trouble in case of Stutsman's
acquittal, as there was an absolute cer
tainty of war between the Haning follow
ing and Stutsinan and his friends.
Howard is being tried for the same
crime and t!,e chances are that he will be
convicted, as the evidence ot Mrs. Stuts
man, wnich wns not admissible at her
husband's trial, will be introduced against
him.

ATROCIOUS CRIME
AT DEADWOOD
Prominent Lady Robbed
and Murdered by
a Negro.
Two Thousand Citizens Sur
round the Prison to
Lynch Him.
The Mob Held Back by Thirty
Guards, but a Conflict Is
Imminent.
DEADWOOD, B. D., May 15.-Mrs.
Emma Stone, wife of Colonel L. P. Stone
and a prominent Black Hills woman, was
murdered last nig tit and all day a crowd
of angry citizens have surrounded the
jail, where the self-confessed murderer,
Charles Brown (colored), is confined for
the purpose of lynching him. The authori
ties are determined to protect the pris
oner to the extent of their ability, but can
do little. The mob seems to be only
waiting the arrival of Colonel Btonefrom
hi 3 ranch twenty miles north. He will
arrive some time to-night, wnen the
necro will be banged. A conflict is im
minent.
Mrs. Stone conducted the Keystone Res
taurant In Deal wood, and as it has always
enjoyed a good patronage the daily re
ceipts were large. She s!ept in a room
partitioned off the dining-room, and some
time in the early morning hours entrance
was effected to it She evidently had been
awakened by the robber and made a short
struggle wi:h him. It was short, indeed,
for the weapon which he wielded â abutch
era' cleaver â proved|terribly effective. One
bow was sufficient. She had been struck
in the right temple, and the blade made a
gash from behind the right ear clear across
her face. It proved instantly fatal.
The crime was discovered early this
morning by one of the servant girls, who
went to awaken her. Suspicion at once
fell upon Charles Brown, a former cook of
the establishment, a colored man, and he
and a negro companion were arrested
while trying to leave the country. He at
once confessed. The room had been ran
sacked from top to bottom and everything
of value taken. He said he was robbing
his victim, when she awoke, and be killed
her to escape detection.
As the Sheriff entered the town with
Brown, the self-confessed murderer, he
was met by a mob of a thousand angry
citizens. Twenty-four Deputy 8h riffs
with drawn revolvers took him through
the crowd to the jail.
The mob now surround the jail, and all
that Is required is a leader. Angry mut
terings are heard on all sides. The mob
at the jail to-night numbers 2000 and
more are coming. No one knows what
will happen before morning. Charles
Brown is a cook, and formerly worked for
the lady. He drove to town last night
from a ranch he owns near Crook City,
and had supper at the restaurant about 8
o'clock. He was seen in the restaurant
this morning about 3 o'clock. There is
every prospect of a conflict between the
mob and the thirty guards at the jail.
A CHEROKEE PHILANTHROPIST.
W. T. Whittaker, a Full-Blooded Indian,
Seeks to Found a Hont3 for
Orphan White Children.
WICHITA, Kans., May 15. âW. T.
Whittaker, a fuli-blooded Cherokee In
dian, whose benevolence has been shuwn
in many charitatle enterprises, is the
originator of a project to establish au or
phans' home for white children in the
town of Pryor Creek, L T. He has issued
the following appeal:
To the peop'e of the Indian Territory and to all
Chriatian peopic throughout the United Stales'.
There are over 300, 0ut) non-citzens in tue
Indian Territory, drifted in nere lrom tiie
various States of tue Union. Many parents
have died and left orphan chiidren, without
relative, home or protection. Many of these
children, are growing up in Ignorance. Tue
Indians all have free schools and orphan
homes. The white children iiave none, the
white man not navlng the advantage that an
India:: has.
Being a Cherokee Indian, myself and
iair.i.y all inherit our land. Looking down
into the future, I can say what the United
States citizen cannot say. My children in
herit their land and the burden is uot left on
me to lay up money and trouble myself in
looking after a home for them, giving me more
time to look after the interests of tne poor.
I have always felt that this was my calling.
Therefore I set spart eighty acres of my land
to be used for the support of an orphans' home
and have resolved to appeal to all my broth
ers in the A. O. U. W.. F. A. and W. O. W..
secret orders of which I am a member, and to
churches and Sunday-schools throughout the
United States for 1 to 10 cc.its etiCh to aid me
iv the erection of au orphans' home near the
town of Pryor Creek, I. f.
This home and school will be under strict
religious influences and non-sectarian, for
boys and girla. I want the names and address
of all persons having orphan children in their
charge in the Indian Territory. Respectfully,
a friend to the orphan. VV. T. Whittakeb.

A THRIFTY INDIAN AGENT.
Captain Baldwin Accused of Various
Shady Transactions Among tfie tied
Men of Oklahoma.
WICHITA, Kass., May 15.â Secretary
Bliss has detailed another inspector to in
vestigate Indian Agent Baldwin of Ana
darko, O. T., and some startling develop
ments may be looked for in spite of Gen
eral Miles' efforts to even up everything.
The report submitted by the last in
spector states that Captain Baldwin paid
more for cattle to be civen the Indians
than the same grades were selling for at
the time, ana charges that in all sorts of
deals wherein Indian money waÂ« involved
he was uniformly careless, to the detri
ment of the Indian fund. The point is
made that the agent has never made a
financial transaction in favor of tne In
dians.
The repoit contains evidence to the ef
fect that the agent went into a schema to
condemn a good $10,000 school building
and wanted to erect a $75,00U building, the
new one to be so locatea that it would
conform to the ideas of Captain Baldwin
and Captain Hugh J. Scott ol Fort Bill.
1 Financial designs are attributed to Cap
toin .Baldwin in this connection, more so,
in faci, than a deaire to supply the intel
lectual demands of the Indian youth. It
is also shown in the report that Captain
Baldwin evaded the payment of a personal
judgment oi $186, secured against him at
El Keno, by cla ming that certai-i prop
erty attached belonged to the Govern
ment, when in fact it belonged to him and
wns liable for levy.
The evidence of Captain Clayton S.
Burbanks and Lieutenant M. E. Seville of
the Tenth Infantry, stationed at Fort Sill,
is given in ihe report, to the effect :nat
Captain Baldwin lor a io;ig period of time
was unfit for any duty by reason of liberal
indulgence in strong drink.
A few pages of the report in devoted to
trie lease question in the Kiowa, Co
manche. Apache and Wichita reserva
tions. The effect of this has been to in
duce the secretary not to lease tne Wich
ita reservation, but to open the same to
settlement.

UNITED ON BUNKER
HILL MONUMENT
Romantic and Startling:
Climax of a Unique
Elopement.
Pursued to the Top of the Tall
Shaft by the Bride's
Angry Father.
But the Pantlnsr Old Gentleman Is
Teased and Tortured Until Ho
Finally Consents.
BOSTON, Mass., May laâ Way np ia
the top of Bunker Hill Monument to-day
was enacted the startling climax of the
most unique elopement here. Judson
Bawkius and Eebecca Wilson, a patriotic
young couple from Cape Cod, came to
town clandestinely this morning and
sought out a justice of the peace of tlieir
acquaintance and repaired to their novel
wsdding-place. It was a wearisome task
which the wedding party haa 10 perform
to reach their goal, for ihere is no elevator
in the big stone shaft and they bad to
climb up the hundreds of s eps of the
winding staircase.
It cost them a quarter each admission
fee, too. Alter resting from their ex
ertions (he kuot was tied. No soon r bad
ibis been done ti.an there came a rade In*
tcrraption to iheir happiness in the shape
of no less a personage than Squire W:ison,
the father of the eride, wLo came puffing
np the stairs, icd in the face from indig
nation and ihe effects of the stair-climb
ing. He had tracked tho eloper?, Dut did
not succeed in arriving upon tho sceuein
time to prevent the marriagp, agair.st
which he had set his foot. At nrst thera
was consternation in the hearts ol Mr.
and Mrs. Hawkins, but Judion was struck
with a bright idea. Taking advantage of
the exhaustion of the fat old gentleman,
who could hardly speak after ciimbing so
many stairs, he jumped upon him, tripped
him upai:d tat upon him. Then, aided
by his newiy won bride, who held his
hands, he tormented and tortured the old
gentleman, until, in despair, that worthy
was compelled io give his consent in or
der to escape, for Bunker Hill monument
is a lonely place, few caring to brave tne
mountain of stairs, and there was no one
withiu hearing to respond to his cries for
help. Squire Wilson is a wealthy land
owner aud the bride is his heiress.

But Those in Distress

Nearly All of the Men Entitled
to Relief Are Naturalized
Citizens.
Reports From Consuls Upon Which
the President's Message Will
Be Based.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 15.â The
President and nearly all the Cabinet mem
bers being cut of town there were no new
developments in the Cuban matter to-day.
The next move depends on McKinley,
and he will do nothing until Monday,
when it is expected he will prepare the
proposed message recommending an ap
propriation for the relief of Americans in
the island.
The official information from Consul-
General Lee and other representatives ol
the United States in Cuba indicates the
number entitled to this relief is very small.
Telegrams from a number of these consu
lar officers were received to-day, and about
all of them have reported on the condi
tions existing in localities over which their
jurisdiction extends. Up to this after
noon the number of Americans known to
the consular officers was about 100, and
some of these are not in need of relief.
The actual sufferers who are entitled to
assistance are nearly all of Cuban birth
â who obtained citizenship through natu
ralization. Most of them are planters and
farmers. The native born Americans are
principally educated men engaged in pro
fessional work. Americans serving with
the Cuban forces cannot hope for aid if
they desire it, for the Spanish authorities
would not permit succor to be given them.
It it probable, however, following its cus
tom in China and other semi-civilized
countries where uprisings endangered
American interests, tfle Government will
furnish facilities to citizens residing in
Cuba to leave the island if they desire to
do so.
All reports received within the past few
days are being put in shape for insertion
in the President's message. They con
firm the stories of distress recently pub
lished in the newspapers of the country,
and represent the deplorable condition
among the poorer people.
It is confidentially asserted that Mor
gan's belligerency resolution will pa^B the
Senate early the coming weeK. This is
the opinion of Chairman Davis, Cullom
and Forakex of the Committee on Foreign
Relations.
Many Senators are also favorably dis
posed toward Gallinger's resolution ap
propriating $50,000 for the relief of suffer
ing Americans in Cuba.
CockrelJ favors more radical methods.
"I should send relief if I could," he said,

AN INDIAN'S DRAMATIC SUICIDE.
To Escape Arrest for Cattle-Stealing He

WICHITA, Kans., May 15. âOne of
those rare instances of an Indian commit
ting suicide occurred near Conway, 1. T.,
recently and the story of tue tragedy is as
follows:
An Indian named Jim Colbert had baen
selling a goodly number of cattle of late
among the people throughout the coun
try, lurnishing a few head at a place. A
man named Allison, who lives in that vi
cinity, had purchased a few head from
him and had just completed the job of
putting the new bunch under his brand
when some other parties roae up and
claimed the cattle. Explanations fol
lowed which thoroughly convinced all
parties that the cattle had been stolen and
then sold, and further investigation re
vealed the fact that an extensive system
of cattle theft was in operation.
Rumors of the innocent parties threat
ening to bring the guilty ones to justice
reached the home of poor Lo, who scorned
the white man's way of goinc to jail.
Quietly walking into nis house he met his
.wile and, 'iissing her, informed her that
all he had belonged to her. He then
stepped into an inner room, reached for
his pun and deliberate!? sent the contents
through his heart. Death was instan
taneous, and tnus, according to Indian
tradition, did he acquit himself honora
bly of the crime about to be laid at his
door.

KITCHEN EUN BY A CITY
At Grenoble, France, an Association
Serves Food at Coat
Housewives who thinfc the co- operative
kitchen is so far in the future that it would
be aosurd to look forward to it for relief
from daily drudgery will be interested to
hear that a kitchen with the same end in
view as the co-operative has been in suc
cessful operation for nearly fitly years. The
Association A'imentaire of Grenoble,
France, is a purely municipal affair. The
city owns it and supplies meals at cost in
its own restaurant or dcliv -ts them at pri
vate homes.
Professor Osborne Ward of the Depart
ment of Labor Statistics spent his recent
vacation abroad studying a number of
socialistic experiments that are being car
ried on in various parts of Europe. He
was interested more by what he saw at
Grenoble than by anything else. The
authorities gave him ali the aid in their
power when they learned he was from the
American Labor Bureau.
Everything at the Association Alimen
taire is as good as money can buy. The
cooks are as clever as any in France,
which is saying a great deal. The provi
sions are bought in the best markets and
are carefully selected. The service is ex
cellent. The dining-rooms are of several
grades, according to the furnishings and
the attendance, so that all tastes may be
accommodated. One may dine there for 3
cents on bread and soup, and be satisfied,
or une may pay 12 cents and have a full
course dinner. In the best rooms, which
are marble floored and decorated with
much elegance, there are waiters who look
for tips as naturally as though they were
in the swellest of Parisian cafes.
Pure wines, which have been properly
aged, are served at about 8 cents a liter.
There is no financial profit to the city in
rnnnine this huge restaurant, which serves
some 15,01)0 meals a day. The charges are
based on the cost of the materials used,
the employment of help and the amount
spent in keeping the uisnsils, machinery
and building in repair. â New York Press.
A Boy's KÂ«Â«;iy on Journalism.
A bright little boy who attends one of
the city public schools was told by his
teacher a few days aeo to write an essay
on "Journalism," and next bay he harmed
in thÂ» following:
"Jouinansm is the science of all sorts
of journals. There is a heap of kinds of
journals. Journals is good things 'cept
when they is hot journals, and then tney
is just awful. My ma, she taices a fashion
journal what is always full of pictures oi
horrid old maids with the ugiiest dresses
on I ever saw. The fashion journal is a
heap gooder than the hot journal, 'cause
the hot journal stops the train and the
fashion journal starts it The fashion
journal don't stop nuthin' but the broken
window light and pa's bank account.
"There i> sheep journals and hog jour
nals and brass journals, too, and pa has
got a journal down at the store and writes
things in it about folks he don't want to
forget. Then we had a woman 'at cooked
for us names Salley Journal. She was the
funniest journal I ever saw. She was a
bald-headed journal.
"They ain't no more journals that I
know of.
"P. S. â I forgot to say that a man what
puts grease on the car wheels is called a
journalist." â Atlanta Constitution.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAT 16, 1897.
GIFTED DAUGHTER
OF MRS. LEASE
Possesses Many Traits
of Her Talented
Mother.
Richly Endowed With Natural
Eloquence and Personal
Magnetism.
Philosopher From Childhood, She
Is Destined to Be a Leader
of Her Sex.
WICHITA, Kans., May 15.â Evelyn
Louise Lease, daughter of Mrs. Mary E.
Lease, who graduated from the Wichita
(Kans.) High School this week, is toe
pride of her gifted mother's heart and is a
remarkable girl in many respects. As a
wee child she exhibited unusual precocity
and has walked and talked since she was
seven months old. She will be 17 on the
20th of next July.
Louise Lease, as she is called, is becom
ing a very interesting and attractive
young lady. She is wonderfully like her
mother, and yet in some ways different.
She has her mother's natural eloquence
and personal magnetism, as was shown
by the tremendous enthusiasm that her
i valedictory oration, which she was forced
to crowd into three minutes of time,
evoked. She is slender in build and will
be tall like her mother. Her voice is
nothing short of marvelous. It is clear,
resonant and strong, and falls with a
strange insistence on the ear, for back of
it is a woman's earnest soul seeking free
expression.
. She has a heavy head of blue-black hair
and the fair skin and blue eyes of the
Irish race. She never cared for dolls, but
nas always been a great lover of books,
and has made free use of the splendid
library of Mrs. Lease, ohe made her
debut as a public speaker rather early in
life and in a very unexpected manner. It
was at the first People's Party National
conference in St. Louis, over eight years
ago, in which her mother took an active
part. There was an immense audience,
and while the conference was waiting for
a committee to report, the chairman
asked little Louise to "speak a piece."
The child gave a recitation lrom Gerald
Massey, beginning:
Coming up the steeps of time
This old world is growing brighter.
She did it full justice, and the long
continued applause forced her to return.
It happened that almost the entire day
had been taken up with discussions over
the adoption of the suffrage plank, and
Louise had become greatly wrought up
over the question. Instead of reciting
aeain, she launched forth into a woman's
suffrage speecn. She spotce in ringing
tones and with dramatic gestures and
said:
"You men must keep your promises
and give us a suffrage plank. You have
been telling us that 'the band that rocks
the cradle rules the world,' but I want to
say to you, gentlemen, that unless you
make your promises good at this conven
tion there will be no cradles to rock and
no babies to put in them."
Mrs. Lease, who was on the platform,
caught the last sentence and in a horrified
whisper said to the chairman, "For
heaven's sake, call that child down!"
but the chairman only laughed and re
plied, "Let her alone; she's all right."
The applause when she had finished
was deafening. At recess they took the
little suffragist up on their shoulders and
carried her around the ball. She was the
idol of the convention.
During Lewelling's administration Mrs.
L ase was visiting the Boys' Reform
School at Topeka, and Louise accompa
nied her. There were 200 boys out on the
playground, and Louise was soon the cen
ter of an interested group. She conceived
the idea that here was an opportune time
to look after her political fences, and she
made a speech to the boys, concluding as
follows:
"Now, boys, a great many years from
now I may be a candidate for Congress or
the United States Senate. By that time
you boys will be men and I want you to
promise to vote for me."
Two hundred lusty-lunged youngsters
applauded with all their might and
shouted, "We will."
Miss Lease is a strict vegetarian, eschew
ing meat, eggs and rail*. She thinks life
sacred and to destroy it a crime. During
the World's Fair her mother introduced
her to Perusha Tan Rao Telang, a high
caste Brahmin priest, who was there as a
delegate to the World's Congress of Re
ligions. The priest became greatly in
terested in Louise and her views regard
ing the sacredness of animal life and told
Mrs. Lease that without a doubt the child
was a reincarnation. That he was deeply
impressed i? proved by the fact that he
came clear from Chicago to Wichita after
the World's Fair for no other reason than
to see the child. His appearance here in
his rich oriental garb nearly scared the
people in the Lease neighborhood out of
their wits. He made a long visit at the
Lease home and whan he left he predicted
a great future for his young friend. In
parting h ? gave her his blessing by re
peating a Hindoo prayer.
Miss Lease wrote the class song and her
poems have attracted considerable atten
tion locally. The last issue of the High
School Messenger contains the following
from her pen:
Forget Me Noti.
I came to-day to the quiet grave
Where lay my love of long past years
And ihe old, old sorrow came, flooding
My eyes with a burst of tears.
But I saw tbroutrh the misty tear-drops
lorgat-me-nots' teuder hue,
And the heart-pain that swelled from longing
Ceased at thai gilmpse of blue.
For as old flowers in old placet spring,
Aa,i year by year their blossom renew,
80, In Heaven will be the old loved facts,
And, dearest, 1 shall liml you.
Her immediate future is to be just one
long play day until next September, when
she will enter college. This summer she
will accompany her mother on a jaunt
among the lukes and later will probably
go with her on her New England tour.
PANTHER AND WOLVES COMBINE.
They Form a Hunting Trio and Divide
ttae Spoils.
Two wolves and a panther formed an
alliance in Maine a month ago, if the
Bredville Local of that State is to be be
lieved, and the result has been disastrous
to wild creatures of that region, as well as
to some tame ones.
"Barker Simpkins and Fred Parsley,"
the Local says, "were hunting over on the
Old Pine ridge a few daya ago, when tney
heard a yelping howl across the swamp as
if dogs were chafing a deer. As the
bounds came closer the men made haste
with still hunters' caution to two run
ways that cros* the ridge, hoping to get a
shot at the dogs, since it is against the law
to hunt deer with dogs in this State. Simp
kins took to the runway on the north
side of the ridge and had scarcely waited
ten minutes wnen he heard the steady beat
of a running deer's hoofs in the three
inches of snow down in the swamp. The
deer came into sight twenty rods away,
headed very nearly toward the place
where tue man was seated, and had come
within ten rods of the man when a lithe
form leaped from a big birch tree branch,
hit the deer and rolled over and over with
it. The deer never pot up again, its neck
having been broken.
"Simpkins was so surprised that he
forgot to shoot for a minute, when the an
imals that were in pursuit of the deer
came into view. They were wolves, tall
and gaunt, wi'h gray hair. The wolves
ran without hesitation to the deer, and
while the beast which had killed it, which
Simp Kins made out to be a panther, tore
at the deer's throat, the wolves bit through
the skin of the haunches and ate chunks
of the smoking tiesD, unopposed by the
panther.
"Less than a week later another nunter,
Sam Wells, found the trails of two dog
likd sets of pawa on a acer trail. Follow
ing these two miles, Wells came to a
gnily, and here were the remnants of the
deer, and the leaps a panther had made
left an unmistakable trail.
"Nick Schumacher, a German, living
two miles from Bredville, a farmer and
sheep-raider, heard a wild commotion in
the sheep shelter in the pasture, which
begins thirty rods from his house. Has
tening into a pair of overalls and felt
boots, Schumacher took his rifle and
made hi* way rapidly along the path to
the shelter. The sheep â mere nad been
fifty-eight of them in all â were seen
to 'be racing about in all direc
tions, bleating in fear. On the
man's approach a long animal bounded
off through the snow, but until it was be
yond the sheep no shots were hred, and
ttiey were ineffectual when tney were
made. Two other animals were there, but
the German did nut see them. Their
trails, found in the morning, showed them
to have been wolves, probably, and the
trail of the jumper was that of a panther.
Eight sheep were killed, some of them be
ing literally torn in two.
'â¢The lact heard of tne odd trio was yes
terday. Burt Jones went fox-hunting
with his dog, a half bull and half hound,
which had put many bears into trees.
Finding the woives 1 trails Jones put his
dog onto them. Three hours' later Jones
who fallowed the trail of his do^, came up
with it. A hip and bis. of the backbone
were on a log and tracks indicated that
one of the wolves had lain there to eat its
share. The head and foreshoulders had
plainly fallen to the lot ol the panther, for
the bones were found under a branch of a
large beech, as if dropped from the beech.
The rest oÂ»' the body nad gone to the sec
ond wolf and lay where the trampled
snow showed the dog's last fighting place.
It looked to Jones as if the wolves hid led
the dog to the panther's resting-place and
there, with the panther's aid. had
killed it"
STJPEKIOB TUBTLE SOUP.
The First Person Who HaJe This Kxcel-
lent Concoction for London.
The first person in London who made
turtle soup for sale was Samuel Birch. He
nourished during the latter portion of the
last and the enr.y days of the present cen
tury. He was not only a purveyor, but a
dramatist, author, colonel of militia, and
finally Lord Mayor of lvondon. Birch in
herited tbe business from his father, who
was a confectioner or pastrycook. The
son much enlarged the scope of the busi
ness and added to it the making of turtle
soup of such superior excellence that all
the famous bons vivants of London met
at his establishment to enjoy the concoc
tion. He did not alone excel in this dish.
He was also noted for t lie quality of his
vnnison, as well as that of numerous other
aliments which he supplied. The principal
attraction, however, was the turtle soup,
with its accompaniments of lemon, cayenne
pepper and toasted bread. After his ap
pointment as colonel of a militia regiment,
in allusion to his calling, be was known
as "Marshal Tureen." This sobriquet he
took in good part. He retorted, however,
upon one of his officers, who was a dealer
in corn and flour, by conferring on him
the name of "Marshal Sacks." Burch
rose successively from Common Coun
cilor and Alderman to Lord Mayor of
London. During his tenure of office the
turtle soup 3eryed at the Mansion
House gave his banquets a vogue
that aroused fierce competition to se
cure invitations. His fame as dramatist
and author lingered for a considerable
period after his death. The inscription
tha* he wrote for a statue of George 111,
in the Council Chamber, Guildhall, will re
call him to generations to whom he would
otherwise be unknown. His daughter was
the wife of the French poet Lamartine.
ProDably England has not produced an
other man who, from the bumble position
of a maker of turtle soup has attained to
so much distinction in so many other
walks of life.â New York Sun.
Only Snmner's Tree Lived.
A member of the Park Commission of
Washington tells a reporter the interest
ing circumstances that, while the trees
on the Capitol grounds planted by John
C. Calhoun, Dixon H. Lewis and "Hon
est" John Davis have all died, the one
which was planted under Charles Sam
ner's direction at about the same time is
alive ana flourishing, and is daily pointed
out by guides as "the Sumner tree." It
was a Scotcft beech, and was not actually
planted by Sumner's hands, but by those
of Commodore Bainbridge. Oalhoun's
tree was a liveoak, and it languished, like
Calhounism. Lewis' tree was an ailantus,
and the wonder is that anyborty or any
thing (succeeded in killing it. Honest
John Davis' was a sugar maple, which
ought to have grown with prouer care.

SAVING THE LAST DIAMOND.
The Only Remaining One of an Heir
loom Cluster Set In a Man'i Tooth.
A new way to keep a diamond from be
ing lost or stolen has been discovered by
F. Van Craenbroeck, 5521 Washington
avenue, with the aid of a Hyde Park den
tist. Instead of having the gem set in a
ring or stud Mr. Van Craenbroeck yester
day afternoon caused the precious stone
to be placed In a cavity in one of his teeth,
where it will be both ornamental and use
ful, and probably in no danger of falling
into the hands of thieves.
This particular diamond has a known
history that extends back through the
French revolution and four senarations of
the young man's family. It was to pre
serve it and not because he needed it as a
tooth filling that he had the stone set in
an upper bicuspid.
The diamond is a small one, weighing
only an eighth of a carat, but it has been
carefully cut. Originally it was set with
twenty-six other* in a gold band ring be
longing to Mr. Van Craenbroeck's great
great-great-^rami mother, who was a na
tive of France. The ring went through
successive generations, and each new pos
sessor lost some of the gems. Finally,
when Mr. Van Craenbroeck obtained the
ring from his mother several years ago
there was only one diamond left.
Some time ago Mr. Van Craenbroeck's
mother died, and he was especially anxious
to preserve the diamond as a memento of
her. The ring, having lost its setting,
was of little value as a keepsake.
Dr. Fredus A. Thurston, whose office is
in the same buiiding as tbat of Mr. Van
Craenbroeck, volunteered to set the gem
in a tooth, where it could not fall out,
probably would not be found by thieves,
and would be a pleasing addition to a
smile.
Monday afternoon a hole was drilled in
the front of the first upper bicuspid tooth
in such a position that when tbe diamond
was set it would sparkle in plain sight
whenever the young man smiled. Yester
day the setting was completed.
The cavity was drilled round, but the
stone bad been cut with one large facet
and many small ones. The hole was only
deep enough to admit a part of the stone,
the remainder being allowed to project
from the tooth like the satting of a ring.
The caviiy was finally filled full of tooth
cement and the diamond was pressed into
it. The large facet was left on the out
side. Then the dentist took a small mal
let and a bit of wood and pounded the
diamond into place, just as is customary
in filling teeth with gold. When tne
pounding was completed the setting or
the stone was ended witb the exception of
scrapinsr away the cement from the edges
of the diamond, which will be done later.
It required the most careful handling to
keep the diamond from getting lost.
Whenever it dropped out of the cavity
during the fitting process the sparkle was
all that enabled the dentist to lino" it.
Once or twice it dropped to the floor, and
the owner of the diamond and the dentist
had a long search for it.
The precious tooth-filling shines best by
lamplight, when it is visible across a stood
sized room. Even by daylight, however,
the sparkle of the gem will be sufficient to
attract attention whenever its owner parts
his Hds. As it is placed at the front of
the tooth the setting will last a lifetime.
It is said tliis is the first csse of a dia
mond being used in Chicago as a tooth
fi'linp. The experiment has been tr;ed in
New York in one of two instances, and in
Europe, but there is no known instance
where a gem with the historical interest
of this one has been set in Buch a queer
place to preserve the stone and not the
tooth. â Chicago Daily Tribune.
The Three K's.
The origin of the oft-quoted expression,
the three R's, was contained in a hand
bill issued by a Mr. James Williams, 'â who
kept a shop not far from Lancaster,
which read aa follows: "James Williams,
parish clerk, Saxtone, town crier, and
bellman, makes and sells ail sorts of
haberdasheries, groceries, etc., likewise
hair and wigs drest and cut on the

LITTLE TOTS LEAD IN
MERRY-MAKING.
Marvels of Beauty Seen in
the Juveniles' Floral
Parade.
LONG LINE OF LILIPUTIAN
TURNOUTS.
The Grand Ball at Night Ends the
Pleasure of the Children's
Festival.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., May 15.â The
Juvenile Carnival of to-day was an un
qualified success. Vainly the croakers and
pessimists, who exist in every commu
nity, not excepting even the City of Roses,
looked for an opportunity to say "I told
you so." Not even the faintest shadow
marred the loveliness of the scene. Chil
dren shouted from pure delight and their
elders beamed with pleasure and good
will as the many beautiful and uniaue
features of the parade swept by. Shetland
ponies, donkeys and trained dogs, re
splendent in trappings of orange and
white and drawing miniature venicles
loaded with children and flowers, were in
evidence in such numbers a? to make the
omnipresent oldest inhabitant wonder
where they all came from.
The festivities commenced at the resi
dence of John P. Overton, on Cherry
street, shortly after noon. There Queen
Helen and her attendant? were arranged
in their regal robes and received the last
loving touches from their proud mamma*.
Meanwhile an immense crowd had gath
ered under the trees of the coronation
-rounds. Soon the trumpets announced
i lie approach of her Majesty and retinue,
and the crowd parted to allow the showy
equipage to pass.
The royal float was drawn by a magni
lirent tandem team and guarded by six
outriders, dre?sed in the carnival colors.
Four grooms in white duck suits led the
horses. The float was draped in orange
and pold and covered with callas.
Queen Helen, looking dignified but happy,
sat on a raised dais under a canopy of
yellow larletan and rosei. Around her,
in graceful attitudes, reclined her four
maids-in- waiting, the maid of honor and
the little flower-girls.
Those of the royal party left their
places upon reaching the park and formed
a procession to the throne. This was a
raised platform under a canopy of trees,
covered with Li France roses and deco
rated with ivy. When the queen had
taken her seat, Miss Marion Geary ad
vanced to the front and said:
"As one of your loving and loyal sub
jects, it is my pleasure to rlace th's crown,
emblem of our devotion and of your
royalty, upon your fair brow. Rule
gently, Queen, and let ua haste with joy to
do your bidding."
Then there was a burst of music and
the Queen, surrounded by a phalanx of
glittering spears, was escorted back to her
place upon the float. Preceded by the
band, the parade moved down the crowded
streets amid cheers and handclapping, in
the following order: Grand Marshal
Willie Siofen on a pony, Parke's Santa
Rosa bund, Police Department, guard of
honor mounted on Shetland ponies, Man
dolin Club in carriages, bicycles, tricycles,
wagons, carriages, dogcarts and floats.
After countermarching before the judges
the prizes were awarded and the parade
disbanded.
The judges were Mrs. Mark L. McDon
ald Jr., Mrs. A. P. Preston and Mias Rena
Edwards.
Tlie prizes were awarded according to
class â a yellow ribbon denoting a first
prize and green for a second. For the
bicyclists the first prize was won by a
double tandem decorated in white and
pink, and ridden by Masters Shirley Bur
ns and Earl Riley, and Misses Irena Wood
ward and May bell England; second, Miss
Juanita Wheeler; third, Miss Ada Mc-
Daniels.
Class B was for the tricylists, and the
prizes were awarded to Jean Ross and
Helen May McMeans.
In class G the children of J. E. Gannon
won the first prize. This was one of the
nrettiest features in the parade. J. E.
Gannon Jr., a flaxen-haired young gentle
man of probably two summers and three
winters, sat bolt upright in a tiny express
wagon, calmly sacking his thumb. The
wee wagon, decorated to produce the ap
pearance of a wLite violet, was drawn by
the occupant's two flaxen-haired sisters
scarcely larger than himself. The effect
of this liliputian outfit on the crowd was
electrical, and brought forth hearty and
prolonged cheering all along tne line.
The second prize in this class was won
by Ralph Spencer with the aid of a little
dog and a pony express wagon.
In class D, Sylvia Rose was first with a
pug and cart. The prize for class E has
not yet been awarded. In class F, eques
trian, Ralph Beldon was first and Georce
Prindle second. In class G, for pony
carts and carriages, first was tafcen by
Kdna Harden and Gladys Eardly, with
a Japanese donkey attached to a rose
covered cart: sacond, O'ive Marshall;
third, Grace King. Miss Dea's Dancing
School in a Corinthian temple won first
honors in class H, for floats, and Mrs.
Monteitn's Mandolin Club was second.
The carnival Dal 1 was a perfect fairy tale
in real life, but more beautiful than any
story-book yarn.

other adjoining buildings.
Fiekporkett Land, in Jail.
BANTA ROsA, Cal., May 15.â A trio of
pickpockets took in the carnival here to
day and during the parade did a thriving
business. J. H. Einhorn observed one of
them with his hand in a women's pocket
and informed the police. Two of the
men took sudden alarm and ran down
Fourth street, closely pursued by Marshal
Steadman, who soon succeeded in landing
both in jail. Several women reported the
loss of their purses during tne day. The
men under arrest seem to be old hands at
the work.

ANIMALS KILLED BY TRAIN.
Foxes and Owls Often Victimsâ How
Dogs Are Lured to Death by Foxes.
The report printed a few days ago that
a buck deer had been killed by a train
near Saviile, L. 1., reminded sportsmen of
many similar tragedies of the animal
world, comments a New York Sun writer.
When the buffaloes roamed across the
plains they not infrequently compelled
trains to stop until the herds had passed.
Antelopes were killed quite often by the
locomotives.
The glare of the headlights at night
seems to stupefy birds and beasts that
cross railroad tracks. Owls are killed
frequently, as well as many other birds,
durinej the migrating season. An engi
ueeron a New Jersey railroad, while mass
ing through the pineries one nieht, heard
a faint crash of glass above the roar of
the train. Instantly the headlight went
out, and tbe fireman went forward to
learn the cause. A short-eared owl had
flown into tbe glass, brosen the chimney
of the lamp and lodged against the re
flector a dead bird.
The fox, in suite of its craft, is one of
the animals most frequently tilled by
trains. The chances are that most of the
foxes killed are young and inexperienced.
In England foxes closely foilowed by a
pack of hounds have been known to run in
tront of a train along the track, then
jump off again before the train came up.
The dogs would follow after in full cry
and a dozen or more would be killed. One
pack ran undor the wheels of an express
in their eagerness to get the fox.
Rabbits, wild turkeys, stunks, part
ridges, quail, squirrels, wild ducks and
geese, and many other kinds of animals
that abide near railroads have been killed
by the trains.

"What do you think of those auto

"Autograph hunters? What are they?"
replied Noah.
"Why people who hunt autographs, of

"Wry do you think so?" asked Scott.
"I never knew a Gael that didn't," said
Thackeray.
" What was that fracas up at the opera

"Oh, nothing much," said Shakespeare.
"Captain Kidd had to be ejected, that's

selves men or horses they were provided
for."
"That was a pathetic little story Peter
Stuyvesant told the other night," said
Munchausen.
"I didn't hear it," replied Boswell.
"What was it?"
"Why, you know, he lost one of his lags

OUTLAW MILLER
AGAIN IN PRISON
The Desperado Caught
by a Posse Near
Prescott.
Is Gaunt From Hunger and
Suffering From a Bullet
Wound.
Train-Robber Parker Still Succeeds
In Eluding Arizona's Man-
Hunters.
PREBCOTT, Ariz., May 15.-L. C. Mil
ler, who accompanied Train-robber Parker
in his recent escape from the jail here,
was captured this morning near Jerome
Junction, twenty-five miles north of Pres
cotit. tie was gaunt from suffering and
lack of nourishment, and limped badly
from a gunshot wound.. Contrary to the
generally accepted stor^, he was not shot
while with Parker south of Prescott. His
wounds were received at the hands of
Jailer Meador while he was escaping.
Meador fired tureo shots while the men
were leaving the courthouse, and Miller
then received two fleih wounds. He sep
arated early from Parker and the Mexican.
The latter was badly wounded by the
jailer, and Miller believes he has crawled
away in some thicket and died.
Deputy Sheriff Fairohild of Coconino
County arrested Miller without trouble.
At Miller's request he was taken to the
Flagstaff jail, as he feared a lynching if
returned to Prescott.
The posse after I'arker is still reported
near Williams, but the prospects of a
capture is no better than heretofore.
Through raids on sheep camps, Parker
now has a fresh horse and is well armed.
In the pursuing party are three of the
best men Arizona could engage for such
service.
They are Commodore P. Owens, Sheriff
of Navajo County, renowned for bravery
at Holbrook, where he single handed
fought and killed four desperadoes in one
battle ; Sheriff Ralph Cameron of Cococino
County, who knows every foot of the re
gion, and Sheriff Ruffner of Yavapai
County, who is so bitterly in earnest that
he has offered $4000 reward on his own ac
count. The posse is expected to run the
fugitive into the impassable canyons that
lead to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.
WEBSTEB'S SCHOOL DAYS.
He Was Considered a Dull r.<>v and
Broke Down as a Declaimer.
"It is dout-tful if, among that group of
intellectual prodigies whose efforts in the
courts of justice and in the National halls
of legislation have been materially felt
during our career as a nation, there can
be found one whose early school days
were associated with such humiliating
and unfavorable circumstances as were
tboio of Daniel Webster, the foster-father
of our American nationality." Buch is
the opening sentence of an article by For
rest Prescott Hall in the January Arena.
The observation is amply justified by tbe
facts that follow concerning Webster's
school days, and his difficulties in making
a speech and 6ven in reciting his lessons.
Daniel's parents were humble folk in
straitened circumstances in what is now
called Salisbury Center, N. H. It took
considerable contriving to enable him to
get tbe education for which he had a pas
sionate iouging; but on May 25, 1796, he
and his father set out for Exeter, where
tie was piaced in a school kept by a Mr.
Clifford. Tbe house is still standing, "tbe
pride of the town." Mr. Hall proceeds as
ioilows:
"When Daniel was given in charge of
the worthy Mr. Clifford it was the first
time he had ever been away from home,
and his feelings can not be better de
scribed than by himself.
11 'The change overpowered me. I
hardly remained master of my own senses
among ninety boys who had seen so much
more and appeared to know bo much more
than I did.'
"It is not to be wondered that the
change overpowered him, a rough, un
trained country boy at 14 years of age.
"It is said that Webster, upon leaving
his son at Mr. Clifford's house, remarked
to this gentleman that 'he must teach
Daniel to hold his knife and fork, for he
knows no more about it than a cow about
holding a spade.' it seems that the com
parison was a good one, for his manners
at the table were so rutle that the other
students requested the landlord to send
him away. But the kind-hearted man
would not consent to tbis, and refuted
even to remonstrate witn Daniel, for he
knew the boy was sensitive and knew no
better.
"He hit upon a plan, so the story goes,
which resulted in teaching the boy how to
use his knife and fork. Webster was ac
customed to hold them in his lists. Mr.
Clifford one day held bis in the same way,
and continued to do so until Web.-ter saw
how ungraceful it was and corrected him
self.
"The knife and fork episode is not much
in itself, but it shows how ignorant Web
ster was when he came to Exeter, and un
der what adverse conditions was his
struggle for an education.
"As to his studies, his success at Extter
was not great. He himself says so. He
seemed unable to recite in a room tilled
with boys, and though he studied hard,
and vras fur from stupid, he could never
make a good recitation. But what is to be
wondered at most of all is that he could
not be induced to speak in public. When
the day came on which the class was to
declaim, although he had learned his
piece, he was utterly incapable of rising
from his seat when his name- was called.
'The kind and excellent Buckminster,'
says Daniel in bis autobiography, 'sought
especially to persuade me to perform the
exercise of declamation, like other boys,
but I could not do it. Many a time did I
commit the pieces to memory in my room,
ye. when the time came when the school
collected to hear declamations, when my
name was called, and I saw ail eyes turned
to my seat, I could not raise myself from
it. Sometimes tne instructors frowned
sometimes they smiled. Mr. Buckmint
ster always pressed and entreated mos,
winningly that I would venture, but I
could never command sufficient resolu
tion. When the occasion was over I went
home and wept bitter tears of mortifica
tion.'
"And now, when we think of Daniel
Webster, tha orator woqpe speeches have
become classic and who towered above
his fellows like the peak of Tenenffe, we
cannot help smiling at tha picture of
Daniel Webster, the boy blushing and
stammering before his schoolmates, and
unable to pronounce a word of the speech
which he had learned and studied for the
occasion.
"It is said that Daniel was so much dis
couraeed by his inability to declaim in
public, and by his treatment at the hand*
of his fellow-students, that at the end of
tne first term, when Dr. Abbot called him
up and asked him if he intended to return
after Christina*, bis answer indicated
something like reluctance. The principal
well knew that Webster's rustic manner*
and coarse clothing had drawn upon him
the ridicule of the boys, who, says Mr.

"It must be admitted that Webster was
slovenly and untidy In his appearance. It
is said that he rarely washed liis facs and
hand?. Many stories are told concerning
this noticeable habit of youth, and the
follow ng instance illustrates very clearly
Webster's unkempt appearance and also
a sally of wit:
"Day after day Daniel appeared in class
with nis bands besmeared with dirt.paying
no attention whatever to the urgent
appeals of the teachsrto keep tnem clean.
Finally the climax was capped. One day
Webster presented himself in the class
room with his usual unclean appearance.
The teacher could stand it no longer, and
quickly calling the boy to the desk took up
his dirty hand and exclaimed in an enraged
tone: 'Webster, if you can show me an
other hand in this room as dirty as this
one I will not punish you. 1
"VVetsier quietly drew up his other
nand and said: 'Here's one, professor.'
The tt acher was wholly taken abacs by
the brightiess of his young pupil and ad
mitted that he was beaten. Webster took
the seat without the thrashing.
"Webster was assured by the kind prin
cipal that he was a better scholar than
most of the boys, and that his constant
application to his â¢ ook*, coupled with a
prodijiiou" facility for labor, was surpris
ing. He aleo told him thai he should be
placed in a higher class, where he would
no longer be hindered by the boys who
cared more for play and dress tnan for
solid improvement.
" 'These were the first enconraeing
words,' says Webster, 'that I ever received
with regard to my studies. I then re
solved to return and pursue them with
diligence and with so much ability as I
possessed. '"
After a stay of nine months at the Exe
ter Daniel was taken to Boscawen, N. 11.,
to be taught by Rev. Samuel Wood. After
one year here the reverend gentleman in
formed his pupil that he was tired of him
and would put him in college at once. Ho
went to Dartmouth and did better work,
learning to speak in public, and by the
end of his freshman year had become
quite a power in the college.â Literary

EVOLUTION IN THE AQUABIUM.
The Fiddler Crab It Now Able to
Climb a Pole.
The Nevs: York Aquarinm continues to
be an attraction for thousands of visitors
daily. While the greater part are simply
spectators there are many who value the
opportunity to study the habits of the
denizens of the deep. Students of crus
tacea here find examples whereby they
can gratify their tastes.
Next to the display of intelligent cltnis
that the Press alluded to last week comes
the tank devoted to several species or
varieties of the crab and lobster genus.
Ihe civilizing effect produced by being
daily fed and otherwise cared for is gradu
ally changing their nature from the orig
inal predatory habit.
More especially is this seen in the nd
dler variety of crab, which Is alert for its
food at the usual feeding hour, seeming
to take note of timn. After its meals it
delights in antics curious and amusing to
lookers-on.
As a dfsposition to climb was shown it
was suggested that an upright pole in the
tank would develop this propensity, and
much to the interest of the caretakers it
readily accomplished it, and now remains
for hours perched en the top. Visitors
â oon discovered that it enjoyed peanuts,
and it expertly cracked the shell, eating
only the Kernel of the nut.
The hermit crab, a far more timid crea
ture, usually keeping within its stolen
shell, realizes its safety now from its ene
mies and roams about, associating with
other varieties, but takes interest only in
filching whatever is handy.
The lobster finds living so easy, through
the system of feeding it, without effort on
its part, that it is rapidly developing
an aldermanic rotundity quite amusing
to see. Its natural pugnacity has disap
peared, and, instead of groping on the
bottom, it no*" frequents the surface,
thrusting out Its minor claw for such tid
bits as visitors freely bestow. While it
shows a disposition to emulate the fiddler
crab in climbing the pole it has not as yet
accomplished it. Thus we have convin
cing evidence that a marked and rapid
evolution of species can be brought about
by obtaining liberal food supplies without
effort and, perhaps, the benent of associa
tion. â New York Press.
HOW TO USE TEAS.
The Quality of tlin Water as Well as
the Leaf Should Be Considered.
The suggestions to tea-dealers by Joseph
M. Walsh, an expert in selecting and
blending teas, might be followed by house
keepers with benefit and satisfaction.
The first is the employment of the softest
water procurable or that which has been
filtered. The next is to boil the water
quickly and use it immediately upon the
boiling point being reached, as overboil
ing impairs its efficacy in extracting the
full strength and aroma from the leaves.
Water short of boiling or reboiie.l can
only make indifferent tea, thin, insipid
and unattractive in color. The time al
lowed for drawing should vary with the
character of the tea â viz., live or six min
utes for China and Japan teas an. l only
three or four forConcou, Souchong, Indln,
Ceylon and Java, because of the great pro
portion of tannin they contain. Exam
ination of the leaves after being drawn
will prove whether or not the kind and
quality of tea desired has been supplied.
The leaves of cnoice, pure tea will be
found of medium and unilorm size, per
fectly formed, unbroken, and if of Oolonc,
green or Japan varieties, of a greenish
color, while Congou, Souchong, India,
Ceylon and Java will Le dark brown.
Another important observance is to select
teas which will accord with the
water which must be used. If very
hard, Padroe, Baryune and strong,
tarry Ooufa Congous are the best,
with Indias of Assam variety and
heavy drawing Ceylons, including broken
leaf Pekoes, as good seconds; for medium
hard water, with all kinds of the finsr
flavored Indias, first crop Fanyongs, Kee
man Congous, Oolongs, Japan and green ;
for soft water, all varieties and grades of
Oolontr, green, scented, Japan, Ningenow,
Paklin, Chingwo, Congous, light drawing
India and Ceylon, and all descriptions of
high-flavored teasshonld be used. â Brook

TROLLEY OAR "238."
It* Bad Record Has Put It Under the
"Hoodoo" J">un.
Trolley car 238 of the Nassau line in
Brooklyn has been temporarily, if not
permanently, withdrawn from service,
owing to its erratichabita and not through
any defects in its construction or ma
chinery. By reason of the numerous ac
cidents in which it has figured it has come
to be regarded as the "hoodoo car," and
the motormen and conductors mn'tually
congratulated themselves, when it was
laid up yesterday iv the Fifth avenue and
Twenty-third street stable.
No. "238' s" first erratic performance oc
curred three months ago, when, without
any apparent cause, it ran off in Ninth
avenue and scared a dozen or more pas
sengers out of their wits. A week or bo
later the motorman of the car became
suddenly ill on the car, and a serious ac
cident was only averted by the prompt
discovery of bis condition by the con
ductor. Then a week later No. 238
jumped Â»he track and wrecked a lamp
post an I a grocery -store.
There were several other minor mishaps
and eventually a killing. The latter inci
dent occurred two weeks ago, and Car
cleaner William Bothwell was the victim.
While he was at work on the roof of the
car it suddenly started off and Bothwell
was thrown to the ground and received
injuries which soon resulted in his death.
"The devil's in that car," was the com
ment of one of the railroad employes who
is familiar with its history. Whether it
will be put in commission again couJd not
te learned last night.â New York Sun.

that point of perfection which it is hoped
may be attained in the near future we
shall hear much less of this class of
disease.
"Ti e most successful physicians do not
now treat the disease so much as the pa
tient; by studying his physical, mental
and moral potentialities and seeking to
develop them in the right directions.
"Knowledge of a child's parents is no
guide to the mental qualites of the child
himself. Twins, though often atsurdly
alike in app?arance, may be entirely differ
ent in disposition. Even the halves of
double monsters frequently have charac
ters very unlike.
"The famous Siamese twins lived very
unhappily. One of them took to drink
ing, and his brother, who did not care at
all for liquor, is said to have been
"seriously inconvenienced." More than
that, they disagreed on the subject of the
civil war and irritated each other to such
an extent that at one time they consulted
an eminent physician as to the possibility
of a separation.
'â¢Medical records give the case of another
mor.ster, the celebrated Hungarian twins
Ritta and Christina. One was almost
beautiful, with agreeaole manners and a
good temper, while the other was plain
and of such a violent and quarrelsome i

IRVING'S EIOHAED.
Past and Present Treatment of the Play
on the English Stage.
As in the other historical plays of
Shakespeare, "alarums and excursions"
are a prominent feature of the action, and
at the Lyceum these battle episodes are \
presented with a stirring martial spirit
and with much pomp and circam- ,
stance. A difficulty in the matter of
stage-managing this play has al
ways been to exhibit with any approach
to plausibility the rival encampments of I
Richard and Richmond, which ought, ac- â 
cording to the text, to confront each other '
on the stage, with the tents of the two I
leaders in tbe foreground Â»nd open to the |
view of the bouse. Asain according to the
text, the ghosts of Richard's victims on the
eve of the battle rise from the stage and
address speeches alternately to him and ;
his opponent. Sir Henry Irving overcomes :
the difficulty by exhibiting the interior of
Richard's tent and Richmond's successive
ly, the change of scene being effected dur
ing a momentary darkening of the stage.
Consequently the ghosts appear to Richard
alone. A very slight cutting of the text
enables this to be done, and an entirely
plausibie rendering of tne dream "busi- \
ness" is 90 easily achieved that, like Colnm
bus' method of making the egg stand on
end, one wonders that it should never have
been thought of before. Broadsword com- <
bats were formerly a much relished feat- \
ure of Shakespearean performances, where i
they are frequent, and that between Rich- j
ard and Richmond has alwnvs been one j
of the most noted. Edward k.ean used to j
make a terrific fight as Richard, so wearing ,
out his antagonist that the latter had no !
breath left wherewith to linish the scene, j
It is on record, too, that the elder Mathews, i
in his zeal as a lencer, fought as Richmond !
for an hour by the clock, declining to let :
Richard fall in a convenient spot or die. '
until a spectator in the gallery, carried
away by the realism of the combat, and I
thinking that ihe tyrant was like to escape, [
called out, amid general laughter, "Yvby !
don't he shoot him ?" At the Lyceum, of I
course, no ?uch absurd excesses are in
dulged in. To an old-fashioned playgoer
it is quite possible that the fight between
Sir Henry Irving and Frank Cooper
might appear tame, but at least we may
be sure that it is conducted secundum ar
tern. The battle itself, it must be owned,
is hardly as impressive as a great event in
English history as it ought to be.
As the stage is sometimes declared,
among others by Sir Henry Irving him
self, to be a valuable medium for the
teachin; of history, it is interesting to
note how far the Richard of the play ac
cords with the Richard of fact. Like j
meaner dramatists, Shakespeare cannot j
be acquitted of "forcing the note." The
real Richard was for from being as back
as he is painted. Lady Anno was only
betrothed, not actually married to the
murdered Prince; and there is little
I ground for believing that she, in turn,
was killed by Richard or that he was in
strumental in the murder of his brother,
Clarence; while, with respect to his pro
posed union wi;h his niece Elizabeth, the
marriage seems not to have b;en distaste
ful to that Princess, who wrote with her
own hand to the Duke of Norfolk begging
him to recommend the alliance to Rich
ard. Truly tue shade of Richard must
owe an undying grudge to that of the
great dramatist, who, for ends of his own,
so grossly malignsd him. â London Times.

The Close of an Eleven- Years' War
to Be Celebrated on
Monday.
NOGALES. Akiz.. May 15.â The ratifi
cation of ihe treaty between the Y.iqui |
Indians and the Mexican Government has j
been postponed until Monday to enable
several high dignitaries of the Govern
ment 10 be present. Indians and soldiers
wbo have gathered at Ortiz in thousands
are ea^er for the festivities wnicn will j
celebrate the termination of a war that
has drazged along for over a decade and
cost Mexico thousands of men and mil
lions of dollars.
Colonel Francisco Peinado of the staff
of General Luis Torres, commander of
the first military zone of Mexico, went to J
Hermosillo on Tuesday to make final ar
rangements for the ratification of the
treaty, and was met there by Juan Mal
donado, chief ot the Yaquis. who signed
the treaty for his tribe. The papers of
agreement have all been arranged, and on
Monday at Ortiz station, on the Sonora
Railroad and about tweuty miles from
Guaymas, the final ceremony of ratifica
tion will take place. The Yaqnis will be
present almost to a man, headed by their
redoubtable Juan Malcionado, orTetabiate,
as he is called by his followers.
Over 4000 Indians arrived at Ortiz yes
terday, and it was reported that as many
more were expected to-day. One thou
sand of these are well-armed fighting
men, who have made a gallant record for
valor. The Mexican Government will be
represented by General Luis Torres,
commanderof the first military zone of
Mcx co, and staff; General Lorenzo Torres
and about 4000 soldiers of the Eleventh,
Fifteenth and Sxteenth Battalions, com
manded respectively by Colonels t ran
cisco, Peinado and Hernandez, and Gov
ernor Ramon Corral of the State of So
r.or.i, Vice-Governor Figueroa, Secretary
of CeJedonio Ortiz and many others
prominent in official and civil circles of
the republic.
After the treaty of peace is signed the
event wi.l be celebrated with a grand
fies;a, wh.ch will probably be of a week's
duration.
The war which will be ended by the
signing of the treaty on Monday Has been
going on for eleven years. The Mexican
Government hat tried for years to uei the
Yarjuin to take their lands on the Yaqui
River in severalty, but the Indians stub
bornly refused to do so, and in 18S6 a large
number of Mexican troops were sent down
there to protect the settlers to whom the
Government had granted land?.
The Yaquis immediately raised an
armed force and commenced to kill the
Bol.Jiera. They burned all the canoes,
launches ann boats â about 100 in all â to
prevent the Mexicans from congregating
flotillas with which to battle on the water.
The Government had over B*3o trained sol
diers in the field in the Yaqui country at
that time an-J the majority of them were
killed by the fierce Indians. Since tnen
there has been a continuous guerrilla
warfare, the Mexicans generally coming
out second best.
The Mexicans have been put to great
disadvantages, as labor is scarce in the
State ol Sonora and the Yaqui- are de
pended upon to do duty in the fields. As
Eoon as tneycan earn enough to buy a few
rifles and ammunition the Indians would
return to tne Yaqui River to fight against
the\r late employers. Thousands of In
diaus who have been worfcing on railroads
and farms in Anzjna and New Mexico
furnished their brethren in Mexico with
arms, ammunition and provisions.
Last August the Indians hatched an
audacious plot whereby they intended to
capture the whole State of Sonora; but
they tailed at tne outset, when sixty j
Indians attacked the Mexican Custom- j
house at Nogales, Sonora, on August 12 j
One of the Yaquis who was captured dar
ing the attack confessed that they had
intended to get $80,000 in gold that was in
the Custom-house at that time, and, with j
the money, they could induce hundreds,
of Papago Indians and Mexican de
serters lo join their ranks. They then in
tended to march to Maedalena, getting
reinforcements along the way. They
were to be met at Magdalena by a force
that was waiting near that place, and the
combined forces were to march upon and
capture HeimosiUo, the capital of the
btate.
A force of Indians was to have left the
Yaqui River at the same time, but when
the band that attacktd the Nogales Cus
tom -house was repulsed by the citizens of
Nogales the scheme fell through.
By the treaty of peace the Yaquis are to !
take their land in severalty and promise i
to ceasa robbing and plundering. The
land that has been in controversy :s well
worth fighting over, as it is the richest in
the republic. The climate is semi-tropi
cal. The same land in the United States
would readily bring $700 an acre. Coffee,
hemp, indigo and tobacco can be raised in
great abundance.
The settlement of the controversy will
be worth millions of dollars to the State
of Sonora, and now tha country will be
rapidly developed. The Yaqui region is j
known to abound in rich gold deposits, as '.
the Indians have often traded large nue- I
gets for arms and ammunition.
The Jfaquis are an athletic and well
formed race. The Yaqui has but few
wants â a cotton shirt and breechcloth for
the men and shawl and petticoat for the
women suffice, while the children run
naked. Unlike the Northern Indians,
their temperamoni is happy and they are
fond of music and drawing. They are
brave and have been known to fight for
hours against great odds. They alone, of
all Indians, aresKillful pearl-divers. They
shun the society of whites and live near
them only to get employment. Their
population in the State of Sonora is about
30,000.

ROW IN A SAUSALITO COURT.
Prosecuting Attorney Sylya Denounces Dr.
Freemen' M as a "Liar, Perjurer and
Scoundrel."
SAUSAI ITO, Cal., May 15.â There was
an exciting scene in Recorder Joseph H.
Pryor'a court this afternoon. Prosecut
ine Attorney Adolph Sylva called Dr.
Richaru T. Freeman of Sausalito a "liar, j
perjurer and scoundrel" and gave him a j
"dreasiti' down" such as no physician
ever received in Sausalito before.
The case on trial was one in which Dr. 1
Freeman, whose license to practice mcdi- i
cine vras revoked by the State Board of
Medical Examiners some time ago, was |
defendant in a suit brought by D. Apple- {
ton & Co. for recovery on certain books ;
purchased by the doctor. The doctor on ,
the stand became contused by the cross- 1
examination by Attorney Sylva and stated
things ilial Sylva said were not so. After
a number of til is the Prosecuting Attor
ney's time to arguo came around, and he j
pitched into the doctor in a manner that |
left that individual in such a state that he ,
could make no reply. The lawyer spoke
of Freeman's "immaculate gall," and for 1
fifteen minutes subjected him to a terrific I
tongue- laihinc. The doctor stopped him j
in tiie middle of tbe spf ech to say tuat he
was accusine him falsely; that he had got
money from him falsely, and had robbed
him.
Sylva stopped only Ion? enough to hear
this, when he bitterly assailed the doctor
again. Recorder Pryor rapped for order,
and threateneJ to adjourn court and re
fuse to hear the case if the contending

BERING SEA SEAL CATCHES.
American Fleet Returns From an Unprofi.
able Cruise in Northern
Wa'ers.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wabh., May 15.â
All tbe vessels of the American sealing
lleet have returned and been inspected,
and reports bays been made by United
States Inspector Enoch S. F. Fowler of
this city. The Willard Ainsworth of
Seattle was the high-liner of tbe Meet, al
though its catch was not remarkable and
will not much more than pay the expenses
of the voyage.
A conspicuous fact in connection with
the catches, Baid Mr. Fowler to-day, was
that 80 per cent of tbe pelts taken were
those of females, from which some idea
can be derived of how long ii will take to
accomplish the extermination of these al
ready decimated herds.
So far as tbe Indians are concerned â
and the fl jet here scheduled is made up
entirely of vessels manned by them except
ing the Ainsworth â they never had such
poor luck before and are thoroughly dis
couraged. It would not be surprising if
they did not go out again this year on
their own account.
The principal reasons for the smallness
of the catches were bad weather wnen the
herd migrating north was sighted, and in
ability to crttcti up with the seals when the
sea was smooth enough to permit of put
ting out boata. This is the catch:
Willard Ainsworth of Seattle 389, Columbia
of Neah Bay 88, J. G. fcwan oi N'eah Bay 56,
Bering Sea of Neah Bay 55, Deehkah of Neah
Bay 30, Teaser of Neah Bay 10; total 628.
IiUCKEXE MURUEUEH&' J-'AJh.
Life Jtnpriionment for th* Slayer* of
Serafino Geniflitani.
REDDTNG, Cal., May 15.â 1n the Supe
rior Court to-day Judge Sweeny sentenced
William Miller, a halfbreed, and Louis
Richards, an Indian, to the penitentiary
for the term of their natural lives, for the
murder of Serafino Geniguani near Buck
eye in this county, on the 18tb of last
March. Geniguani kept a winery and
sold to the two men several bottles of
wine. They became crazy with drink ana
to get more broke into the wine cellar. In
the quarrel resulting Geniguani's throat
was cut and his body was dragged into a
fence corner for concealment.
Subsequent to their arrest both men
made several alleged confessions, contra
dictory and untrustworthy. Last Satur
day they pleaded guility in open court
and to-day evidence was taken to deter
mine the magnitude of their crime. Judge
Sweeny, in sentencing them to life im
prisonment, explained that the only facts
in extenuation of their crime were that
the murder was committed while they
weredrunfc, tnat tbe liquor that crazed
them (>ad been furnished unlawfully by
their victim ana that they had shown no
previous malice.
XJUMIT HI FEU GOLD.
Women Gather 3fos* Streaked With Xel
toie Hake*.
REDDING. Cal., May 15.â Donald Mc-
Intosb, the Trinity County mine-promo
ter, tells a golden-hued story about the
moss-coveted rocks that in places line the
banks of ib.3 Trinity River. When the
good wives and daughters of the miners
living near the stream have needed pin
money this spring they gathered this moss
from the rocks, picked it into small parti
cles and panned out the sod in a prospec
tor's pan, always getting more or less fine
gold, and sometimes making quite a re
spectable c can-up.
Alclntosh explains that the muddy
waters of the Trinity River, which has
been unusually high this season, con
tained tine gold in large particle?, and the
sediment, straining through the moss, de
posited the gold in mo moss. He says
that as much as $7 In one day has been
obtained in the manner described by three
women working together. â¢

SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., May 15.â
"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth" is the unwritten Jaw of the Piute
Indians in this country, and the recent
killing of four white men by the Indian
Ahvole near iiazdad was ths outcome of
the murder of Piute Chief John Moss by
two Mexicans, who are now in San Quen
tin, one for Ufa and the other for five
years. People in the vicinity of Bagdad
have been fortified in coal-bunkers at that
place, momentarily expecting an outbreak,
and Sheriff Hoicombof this city was sum
moned by telegraph to the scene yester
day. The killing of Ahvole will have a
tendency to quieten matters in that
vicinity. .

ST. PAUL VYING
WITH DETROIT
Each City Eager for the
Conductors' Next
Convention.
Energetic Lobbying Among
the Delegates Now at Los
Angeles.
Eastern Visitors Will Go on an Ex
cursion to Catallna Island
To-Day.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 15.â The
visiting conductors and their companions
are beginning to leave the city, though
they would prefer to tase it along with
iiifm, so well have they enjoyed their
stay. One section of the Chicago special,
consisting of five sleeping-cars, started at
10 o'clock to-night for San Francisco, en
route to Portland and thence eastward by
the northern route. None of the working
delegates will be with this party, for they
have plenty to do in convention here be
fore the final adjournment, which will
probably be next Tuesday.
The election of officers is deferred to the
last day of the session. On that day also
will be decided where the next convention
is to be held. ThÂ« competition has nar
rowed down to the advocates of St. Paul
and Detroit, both cities offering special
inducements for the acceptance of their
cordial invitation. Electioneering is being
actively carried on by the adherents of
the parties representing the competing
cities, with St. Paul slightly leading in
favor. Workers for St. Paul are distrib
uting pretty books of pictures of that city
to influence votes in the convention, and
the Detroit party is putting out a large
number of buttons as reminders, and
many of these are in evidence on coat
lapels.
A drizzling rain and an overcast sky in
terfered witn the pleasure of the visitors
to-day, but thousands of bright-hued
badges of red, green and white were ex
posed to the weather, so many of their
wearers being determined to see all there
was to be seen while the opportunity re
mained. A large number of visitors en
joyed the carriages drives given them Dy
hospitable citizens under the auspices of
the Chamber of Commerce. The dele
gates, who kept in retirement during the
afternoon, did their best to enjoy the
morning drive in spite ol ihe rain. About
300 visitors went to Redondo by the nar
row-gauge road to see the ocean. To*
morrow everybody is expected to go 'o
Catalina Island if sufficient coats can be
obtained. The steamer Hermosa has been
put into commission, but as the one boat
was scarcely equal to the load that is
promised the Bannings undertook to put
on another steamer.
The wish of the Transportation Com
pany was frustrated by a peculiar situa
tion. It was necessary to ensage an extra
marine engineer for the purpose, but a
diligent search of the city and inquiry at
the employment offices developed the fact
that no marine engineer holding the
papers to permit him to serve legally
could be found, and there was no time to
send elsewhere for a man to take the
place.
The business meeting to-day was wholly
of a routine nature, committee work occu
pying most of the time. The scalpers'
resolution is being warmly discussed and
it will not be disposed of without a spirited
controversy.
Tbe Elks had a social high jinks this
evening for tbe conductors, and it was a
notable one. The Order of the Eastern
Star tendered a reception this evening to
visiting ladies of the auxiliary at Masonic
Temple. On Monday evening tne Knights
of Pythias lodge will hold a grand recep
tion for the conductors who are members
of that order.
A fact worthy of note in connection
with the rumors of trouble over the rela
tions between tbe Order of Railway Con
ductors and the non-union conductors on
the Santa Fe is that none of the free ex
cursions given to the visiting conductors
have thus far been on the Southern
California lines of that system, and that
company is not deficient in generosity,
either.
The Pennsylvania special train is still
blockaded at El Paso by a washout. The
chances are that the train will not arrive
here until after the convention is over, or
it may turn back as soon as the track is
clear and not come through.

Juan Lugo l onfrtuem a CrimÂ« of fire
l'firs Ago.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 15.â Juan
Lugo, the Mexican who baa been started
back to Mono County to be tried for the
murder of Tom J. Leahy on June 12, 1892,
confessed ttie crime to the officers here
just before he was taken away. He was,
he says, discharged by Leahy, who had
threatened to take his life. He and a
partner went fishing at Grand Lake and
Silver Lake. He says:
"I started home from Silver Lake, and
on the way I saw Leahy, accompanied by
another man, riding toward me. When
they got within 100 or 150 yards I beean to
think of what Leahy had said about kill
ing me, and I became terribly frightened.
I wf.s so afraid Leahy would kill me that
I drew my pistol and shot him. He fell
off bis horse, and 1 tnrned and ran. I did
not know whether I had killed him or
not."
AIHiS TO THE 1 ZtiKY DEPOT FVUD.
â Disposition of the J*remium Jlealited on
the Â»nle of ftonrts.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 15. â The
question arose in the Controller's office
not long ago as to whether or not the
Board of Harbor Commissioners was en
titled to use the $7125 premium on the
San Francisco ferry depot bonds. The
people of the State voted for the issuance
of $600,000 bonds for the ferry depot.
These Bold for a premium of $7125, and
the Controller wa* in doubt as to what
disposition to make of the amount, al
though the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners claimed it.
In an opinion on the subject, the At*
torney-Gpneral states that it is evident
that the Legislature intended that tno en
tire proceeds from the sale of bonds
should be used for the construction and
furnishing ol the ferry building. Conse
quently he holds that the premium on
the sale of the bonds should be paid into
i the San Francisco depot fund, to be used
by the Harbor Commissioners for the pur
poses specified.

acres in eat, which he estimates will
yield 200,000 sacks. On Monday he will

traction engine to be used in running his
thrashing-machine. He expects to run
the engine overland to Ensenada, a dis
tance of eighty miles. This will be the
first time such a thing has been attempted
and it is made necessary because there is
no hoisting gear of sufficient size on the

Tramp* Overrun The Needles.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., May 15.â
District Attorney Daley has just returned
from The Needles, whither he went in re
sponse to an urgent call for his services.
It was found that under the new county
government law constables had no re
course for the collection of fees for
transporting vagrants to the county seat,
208 miles distant, and as the city there is
overrun with boboa the citizsns are in a
quandary. The situation has become so
serious that a vigilance committee was to

WHY DIMOND HAS
SUED MISS BLAIR
Mystery of the Lawyer
and the Lady Has Been
Cleared Up.
SENSATIONAL CHARGES
INVOLVED.
All the Trouble Arose From One
of the Amours of General
Barillas.
EACH SIDE SUBMITS ITS OWN
STORY.
One of the Most Remarkable Scandals
That Has Baen Expos .d for
Many Years.
Out of the mystery that has enveloped
the suit of Henry P. Dimond, an attorney,
against Miss Lillian Blair, formerly a
cashier for M. A. Gunst, have come de
velopments that pile sensational charges
on similar counter charges, together witti
a scandal that will cause the tongues of
gossips to wag in unctuous tones for even
more than the traditional nine days.
The beginning of the story dates from
the time of the visit of ex-President
Manuel L. Barillas of Guatemala to this
City during the summer of 1896. At this
time Miss Blair was employed as cashier
in the cigar-store of M. A. Gunst & Co., at
the corner of Ellis and Powell. She was
then and is now a young lady of
more than ordinary attractions, and it
was not long after his arrival
that the "General," aa Barillas came to be
popularly known, showed that he had
been smitten with the pretty cashier's
charms. His attentions were apparently
well received and soon, as all statements
agree, he was on most intimate terms with
his inamorata, lavishing upon her dainty
and costly presents and even going so far
as to opeu the strings of his purse to her,
almost without restraint.
Bat at this point the story is told in
widely divergent versions, and this differ
ence is what led to the suit now pending,
nnder the title of Dimond against Blair,
for $10,000 for professional services.
Dimond's version, briefly told, is that
Miss Blair, on the recommendation of
mutual friends, employed him to institute
a suit for breach of promise and betrayal
on her behalf against General Barillas.
He claims that she told him that she
believed Barillas to be unmarried and
that she was betrayed under promise of
marriage. lie further states that when
he was about to file the complaint in the
case his client, her mother and her sister,
through the influence of Louis Hirsch,
the attorney-in-fact of Barillas, and of
Milton 6. Eisner, the general's attorney-at
iaw, were induced to make false affidavits
confessing that they knew Barillas to be
a married man, and that Lillian had be
come intimate with the Guatemalan ex-
President without promise of marriage
being held out to her as an inducement.
These affidavits further charged that
Dimond and the two mutual friends, L. T.
Cranz and Dr. E. L. Perrault, wno had in
troduced Miss Blair to Dimond, were en
gaged in a conspiracy to extort money
from the gay Guatemalan.
The other side of the story in simply
that the affidavits referred to are a rela
tion of the actual facts in the matter.
Ditnond further states the pending suit
was brought for the purpose of vindicat
ing himself.
This is the sensational history of the
case up to the present time told by Di
niond yesterday:
I have been admitted to the bar of this State
for about fourteen years, and have practicsd
ray profession in San Jose and in this City.
During the mouth of December, 1896, my
friends, Dr. J. and K. i>. Perrault of this Ciiy,
expressed a desire to introduce me to a young
lady who had a meritorious cause of action
against a wealthy resident of Guatemala. I
agreed to examine tbe case, and if upon ma
ture investigation it appeared to have merit I
would undertake the prosecution of the action.
I was introduced to the vouug lady, who
turned out to be Lillian G. Blair, the defend
ant in the present action. Miss Blair made to
me a long statement of her ca*e, which I took
down in writing in her presence and which
she assented to v.hen subsequently read over
to her.
This statement in effect sÂ«i forth that Gen
eral M.L. Barillas, an ex-President of the re
public ot Guatemala, lieu sought her acquaint
ance while s-he was engaged as cashier at the
cigar-store at M. A. (Junst, under the Baldwin
Hotel, rÂ»nd hal foliuwc-d up the introduction
by a request '<â¢ visit her uf the house of her
parents, 005 iage street, in this City.
She inioriufl me that the visiis and atten
tions o( General Barillas continued for sev
eral weeks, during which time he made her
ireauent presents â flowers and candy â
appropriate to a courtship between a
lady and gentleman. These visits were
made with the full approval and permission
of her mother, !Â»!rt. Kaio Blair, her father be
ing a part of the time absent irom the city.
These attentions finally culminated, accord
ing to Miss Blair's account , in an < ffer of.mar
riage, which when communicated by Miss
Blair and General Barillas to .Mrs." .Blair,
through his interpreter, Mr. Ribas, met with
the approval and Llessnij,' oi tne mother.
This courtship, after the approval of the en
gagement by Mrs. i;!air, resulted in various
attentions ana presents of large value from
General Barillas toMlsa Ulair, including four
diamond rings and a loeicer, formerly tho
property of General BariiUs" daughter, con
taining a picture of the general, a watcn and
chain an<l unlimited credit at the White
House and City of Paris fora wardrobe befit
ting a young lady engaged to bj married to so
exalted a personage.
The courtship was carried on in a singular
manner through tn interpreter, one Armando
Ribas, at present acting as a runner fur the
Occidental Hotel and formerly employed in
the same capacity ut tho Palace. Mr. KiDas
acted as the interpreter of General Barillns in
his courtship and his amanuensis in writing
many oi the impassioned missives winch he
indited to his lady-love.
When I was first employed In the case a
voluminous correspondence," consisting of be
tween iortyaud sixty letters and telegrams, was
exhibited to me and entrusted to my care. Of
this correspondence all t.'iat professional obli
gation permits me to divulge is the fact that
they establish beyond all doubt either an hon
orable proposition of marriage or insidious at
tempts to deliberately betray an innocent and
confiding girl. I
I likewise made Independent investigations
Into the character of my client, and discov
ered that as far as I know it was beyond re
proach.
I proceeded to draw up a complaint for
breach 01 promise of marriage against General
Barillas, and awaited his return from Europe,
whither he had gone for a brief visit. Suffice
it to say he Old not return, and the question
oi proper procedure in the case was the sub
ject of many and lengthy conversations be
tween my client, her motner, her sister and
myself and my associate counsel.
Upon discovery of the lact that General Bar
illas did not intend ;o return to this City, but
had sailed from New York direct to Guatemala,
1 was brought, through Mr. Henry Ach, one of
the counsel for the plaintiff in the case, into
relation with Louis Hirsch, a person averting
himselttobe the attorney in fact of General
Barillas, ana of Mme. Barillas, his wife.
Mr. Hirsch expressed the greatest possible
anxiety to ai-rive at an amicable adjustment
of this matter and requested me to withhold
the filing of the complaint until he bad ex
hausted all his efforts 10 effect a settlement.
At that time, at the request of Mr. Hirsch,
all of the documentary evidence in my posses
sion, boih lettersjnud telegrams, was submit
ted for his inspection and pronounced by him
to be in the genuine handwriting of General
Barillas, or signed by him. Mr. Hirsch re
quested sufficient time to communicate with
his principal in Guatemala, which J granted.
Finally upon the 27th day of April, 1397, I
was invited to meet Mr. H;rÂ»ch at the office of
Messrs. Rothchild & Acb. two of my asso
ciate counsel in this City. Upon receiptof the
invitation I immediately went to the office in
company with Mr. Thornton. Upon my ar
rival I found Mr. Hirsch and Milton S. Eisner.
Mr. Eisner requested through Mr. Thornton
that I should temporarily withdraw from the
room.
Confiding in the loyalty and devotion to my
interests of Mr. Thornton and Mr. Ach I did
withdraw to an adjoining room. After the
lapse of three-quarters of an hour Mr. Tnorn
'oninTited me Into the room with Messrs.
Hirsch and Eisner and six type-written docu
ments, purporting to be affidavits and state
ments under oath of Mrs. Kate Blair, mother;
.Mrs. Mamie Phillips, a sister, and Lillian U.
Blair, were tendered to me by Mr- Eisner.
These affidavits in substance proceeded to
detail a conspiracy between Dr. K. L. Perrault
and F>r. L. T. Cranz and myself, by and
through which we intended to extort money
from General M. L. Baril as by means of a
false and unjust charge of breach of promise
of marriage and betrayal of Miss Lillian G.
Blair.
In those affidavits it was alleged that no
promise of marriage had ever been made by
General Barillas to Mi<s Biair and that the
alleged betrayal which had taken place was a
betrayal with the full consent of Miss Blair
and with the procurement, approval and con
nivance of her mother and sisters.
The affidavit then proceeded to state that I
knew these facts, and notwithstanding my al
leged knowledge ot the facts as stated iv the
affidavits I had incited and coerced and pro
cured Miss Blair to persist in and bring an
actrion for breach of promise of marriage and
betrayal against General Barillas.
I was mexpressediy shocked by the affida
vits. I had never realized in my life such a
depth of human lihsulc-s and depravity as
the act of a mother and sister in swearing that
they had procure! and consented to the be
trayal of their daughter and sister.
Mr. Ach and Mr. Thornton in my presence
voiced their unspeakable contempt for the
allegations of the affidavits so far as they re
flected upon me, and they approved of my
course under the circumsta:.ces. Messrs.
Hirsch and Eisner then withdrew.
1 was not offered a copy of the affidavits, and
upon their demand, made at my request, Mr.
Ach and Mr. Thornton were refused a copy of
those documents, At the same time a release
of all causes of action from M;ss Blair to Gen
eral Barillas was exhibited to me, which, of
course, made the maintenance of any action
by Mi^s Blair against Gereral Barillas utterly
impossible.
Mr. Eisner, before the interview had closed,
served upon me a written demand from Miss
Blair for the letters and telegrams and other
documentary evidence which she had placed
in my charge. To this demand, under the ad
vice of Mr. Ach and Mr. Thornton, I made a
prompt aud indignaut refusal, as the posses
sion of those letters constituted my only de
fense against a charge of extortion and black
mail, attempted to be sustained by the most
gross and infamous perjury.
At the same time Mr. Eisner banded me a
demand signed by Miss Blair for the return of
certain jewelry, consisting of four rings and a
locket, which she had placed in my hands
with written author, iv to piedge the same far
the sum of $'^00 for her immediate necessitk s.
I promised â¢.â > return these articles upon the
next day, which I accordingly did. Upon this
occasion Louis Hirsch, formerly mentioned, j
in my presence, took from his pocket the j
r,ecessary sum of money and handed it to M:ss ',
Blair, who handed it to me.
Of course these occurrences terminated all
relations, professional and otherwise, between
Miss B.air and myself. I determined to brinp
an action lor my own vindication. This I
have accordingly done. In this action a de
mand for a bill of particulars has been served
upon me, which will be ti.ed on Monday.
It is aiso mv intention on Monday morning
to file a motion, accompanied by the affidavits
of E. L. Perrault, L. T. Cranz and my
self under section 1000 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, for leave to inspect and
take a copy of the affidavits aud statements
of Mrs. KiUe Blair, Mrs. Maude Phillips and
ftftai Biair to which I have referred. I have
exhausted all other means of obtaining ac
curate copies oi those aflidavits and state
ments.
VVnen obtained I shall take all or any lur- !
ther stops in the direction of legal redress '
which commend themselves to the reason and
judgment of my counsel.
In response to the .charge that there never
was tiny promise of marriage from General
Barilla* to Miss Blair and tbat I was fully in
formed of tne fact, I deem myself justified on
the present occasion, inasmuch as the affida
vits mentioned refer to two letters written by
General Barillas to Miss Blair and to Mrs.
Blair, to make them public.
1 recognize the professional obligation of
counsel to keep the secrets of a client. II Miss j
Blair and her mother and sister had not n ale
the-e letters public by direct reference in their
affidavits they should not have been published
Dy any act ot mine until the matter came tin
for final trial in a court of competent jurisdic
tion; but Inasmuch as they have been made
public I feel no.hentation in giving them the
same publicity.
In conclusion I invite Louis Hirsch and Mil
i ton S. Eisner to make those affidavits public in
the most formal manner, either by publication
in the daily press or by filing the same in the
record of this action. 1 shall then establish
[ the responsibility of tne real llbelers in this
I matter and determine the course which 1 shall
adopt with reference to them.
Finally I have but to say that I disbelieve
the facts as stated in the affidavits oi these
women. These statements under oath were
I made under the pressure of the most direful
i and pinching poverty, while ostensibly de
clared to be made without the promise or
hope of consideration,
I realize that in their long lives of poverty
there has been but a short glimpse of wealth
and luxury and that they have been tempted
and dazzled by the same like the moth by the
brilliancy of the flame of the candle. I be
lieve that they have been tempted by prom
ises of wealth and luxury and that they will
discover their mistake too late.
Barillas Was "Emotioned."
These are the letters verbatim referred
to by Diruond in his statement, neither
bearing date, the first having been written
to Lillian Blair and the other to her mother
on the same day â some time in July, 1896:
Up Own Lili: What shall I say ? What can
I express in this moment of happiness that I
possess thee and at the same time satisfied
time to have leit tbe impulse of your heart to
be all in accord with your mother and you as
a good daughter obeyed and liked.
We are fortunate and I am so emotioned
and satisfied that all day I was contemplating
our iucky star of conduct of your beloved
mother, ihat we had nothing contradictory or
deceptive from her side. You remember the
moment when she united and blessed us. Re

He Takes With "Proud."
Dear Madam: As I had the pleasure to-day
to make personally your acquaintance and

In support of the bill of particulars L.
T. Cranz. a dentist of 1411 St. Charles
street. Alameda, and having his place of
business at the corner of Sutlerand Stock
ton streets, ia this Ciiy, makes affidavit
that be was personally acquainted with
Lillian G. Blair.her motherand sisters.and
was their confidant in regard to certain
relations between MissÃ!air ana General
Manuel L. Barillas. Cranz says the
youns lady informed him that she was
engaged to the general, and she was agi
tated to learn from him for the first time
that the ex-f resident was a married man,
He subsequently introduced her to Dr.
Perrault and Attorney Dimond. He
heard of the "quit-c'.aira" affidavits of the
Blairs alleging conspiracy, and t;ie attor
neys for Barillab' side subsequently, he
says, offered to destroy said affidavits if
certain damaging letters and telegrams
from Barillas to the Blairs, in the bands
of Cranz and Perrault, were destroyed.
Thii offer wai declined "upon the
ground that like or similar affidavits could
be obtainel from the same sources by the
same means as oiten as Messrs. Hirsch
and Eisner chose to make it worth their
while to obtain them an<i upon the further
ground that they constituted our vindica

Mr. Cranz's affidavit concludes:
The said Hirsch likewise said to me that he
considered General Barillas morally bound to
pay the bill of sÂ»id <vr>men due to me, amount

polite intimation was uot accepted by me- I
cannot recani thU remark upon the part of

I knew that the said Manuel L. Barillas
â  M- a married man when he made the
alleged proposal of marriaje to the de
fendant herein, or when he seduced
the defendant herein, or that knowing the fact
that she had been seauned with her own full

Henry Acn, formerly of counsel for Miss
Lillian Blair, made the following state
ment:
1 was waited upon by a friend and client of
mine und requested to step into these mazes
and assist Mr. Diniond in obtaining for this
girl the recompense she was entitled 10. This
girl had toid this party that, 6fie bad been be
trayed under a promise of mar.iage by General
Barillns.
I at first refused to baveanything to do with
the case. 1 wa? then approached und urgently
requested to lisien to the girl's story, and
finally concluded so to do. She came to me
then alone and unannounced.
I cross-examined her lor one hour. She pave
i me the lull details of the courtship oi Gen
eral Barillas, the betrayal under the promise
of marriage, the askine for tier band by Gen
eral Barinas, the b esaing of her mother and
many detalli whicn she advised me were not
known by Mr. Dimond, and which up to this
time 1 have not divulged to Mr. Dimond.
She slated to me that ncr only fear of Mr.
Dimond was that he was anxious to save her
reputation and a lawsuit, and that lie might
compromise too cheaply, ana that she desireu
me iv the case, believing tf>at If I went in and
the c.ise was tried that whatever I woula â 
charge would bring her a beuer return au<t aj
jarirer ci mpromise.
1 finally consented to aid |Mr. Dimond and I
Mr. Thornton in tbe case, and from that day '
to (bis, Having had no occasion to, have never j
seen tne lady untli the time Mr. Hirsch re
deemed her jewelry.
I was somewhat familiar with the corre
spondence and in March toot several
of General Barillas* pictures and the letters
w-itten by him in Spanish and written in |
English and signed by him to Mr. Hirsch for j
the purpose of showing him that General j
Barillas had promised this lady marriage. I
told him that it was tbe desire of the counsel
in the case to at once institute suit, but ihat,
knowing him p>rsonally to be the agent
of General Barillas and his particular
friend, asked him whether he desired to write
to General Barillas before suit was com
menced. Ho said he did, and be desired
to make illusion to the letters and wanted to
know at what terms a compromise could be
effected. He was told, and promised to write
to General Barillas and advise us at once upon
receipt ol an answer from him, and upon his
prom ac and urgent request it was agreed that
the complaint of Miss Blair would not be filed
until he had received an answer.
1 aid not see Mr. Hirsch again until he re
quested a private interview with Mr. Thornton
*nd myself. He called at my office with Mr.
Eisner the 27th of April and stated that he I
desired to apprise me of something which
would unquestionably surpri.-e me.
He told me that Mr. Dimond and Miss Blair
had combined together for the purpose of de
ceiving Mr. Thornton and myself, and toidnie
that Miss Blair had sent for him and
told him that tne whole thing, as stated
by Mr. Dimond, was uutrue, and that
Dr. IVrrault and Mr. Dimond had concocted
the whole scheme for the purpose of deceiving
associate counsel and suing General Barillas.
I at once announced that I did not believe it,
wne-eupon they produced copies of affidavits,
which they said were made by Miss Biair, her
mother ai.d sister. These affidavits you know
about already.
I at once announced that, of course, I could
not and would not act for Miss Blair in any
litigation, but that so far as the truth was
concerned they were infamous lies; that I
knew Mr. Dimond to te a gentleman ol
hign standing and good morals, and
that I had been enough of the original
correspondence written by General Barillas
to stamp these letters es falsehoods, and de
clared to these gentlemen in the presence of
Mr. Thornton that some one had purchased
from Miss Biair, her mother and sister tbe
statements and affidavits which they bed.
Mr. Hirsch at ouce declared that he had been
no party to giving them any money and had
no relations with them and would not have
any. 1 stated to Mr. Hirsch that I did not be
lieve that he individually would be a party to
any such aer.
They made a request shortly afterward. Mr.
Dimoud, at my request, came to my office, and
Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Eisner then produced a
demand from Miss Blair to Mr. Dimond for
the letters, pictures and correspondence
which he had in his possession. lat once ad
vised Mr. Dimond to refuse to deliver these
pictures, and lie desired twenty-four hours to
consider the matter, and an appointment was
arranged for the next day.
At that time Mr. Eisner came to my office
with Miss Blair, her mother and another
daughter. Mr. Eisner was miormed that Mr.
Dimond would not deliver up these papers,
that if he desired them he could issue a re
plevin for Miss Biair if he represented her.
He denied that he represented her.
Therein on a demand was made for some
jewelry which Mr. Dimond had taken as the
agent of Miss Blair for the purpo-e of procur
ing for her means of subsistence.and be was in
formed by Mr. Eisner that M iss Blair had told
him that she desired to redeem them. Mr."
Dimond told Mr. Eisner that ttiey were In
pawn, and that heconid get them next day,
and that about $200 would be required to do
it. An appointment was fixed for the next
day tor the purpose of talcing up this jewelry.
The next day, according to appointment,
Mr. Hirscn.the Castle brothers, Mr. Eisner, Mrs.
!'. â ;,ir. Miss Blair and Mrs. Phillips called at
my office. Mr. Dimond was present, and had
the jewelry. It was identified by Mifs Blair,
and Mr. Hirsch took from his pocket sufficient
money to redeem the jewelry and paid it to
Mr. Dimond. The jewelry was then handed
to Miss Blair, who in turn ha.idcd it to Mr.
Hirsch.
A receipt was drawn and signed by Miss
Blair, aun Mr. Eisner was asked to sign trie re
ceipt as a witness and he refused to do so.
Mr. Hirsch whs so asked and he declined to do
ho, and then Mrs. Blair was asked to sign and
she said she would if Mr. Eisner asked her to
do it. Mr. Eisner said she could do as she
pleased. She then declined.
Thereupon 1 said to Mr. Hirsch that I de
sired to inform him that I had changed my
opinion, and that I believed he had been a
party to the purchasing of these statements
lrom these women. He said I owed nim an
explanation for that statement. I said my
explanation was this: That it was apparent
to uny one's mind that a respectable gentle
man would not appear st a gentleman's office
and redeem jewelry in pawn for a woman who
admitted nerself to be a woman of the charac
ter as stated in the affidavits, particularly if
that gentleman was a merchant of standing
and a man of family. Mr. Hirsch made no
reply.
j, with Mr. Thornton and other advisers of
Mr. Dimond, have been quietly waiting for
Mr. Kisner to present the affidavits in his pos
session charging Mr. Dnnond with unprofes
sional conduct to the proper authorities, and
as this has not been done I have coincided
with the advice given Mr. Dimond to make
this matter public and to take such steps as
might be proper to vindicate himself.
I firmly believe the statements made by Mr.
Dimond and know that Mis* Blair told me the
truth \\lu-n she sought my employment in the
case.
THE BLAIRS TALK.
They Acknowledge That They En
tered Into an Attempt to Ex
tort Money.
Lillian Blair, her sister Mamie and
their mother, Mrs. Blair, were inter
viewed last evening at the Hotel Nor
mandie, and, while under the stress of
great excitement, tolii a coherent story
embracing the events aud incidents of the
love affair in wbicli General Bari.las and
L>llian Blair were the central figures, and
the mother and sister, interested specta
tors, participating in the distribution of
the general's coin.
Lillian freely acknowledged that she
met General Barillas in June, 1896, and
became warmly attached to him. He was
the most generous of gallants, and was
lavishly liberal in his professions of love
and in his gifts to the object of bis adora
tion.
Sister Mamie freely acknowledged that
the general was the kindest, warmest
hearted and most sincere of men that ever
cast a ray of sunshine on three poor and
friendless women.
This exhibit of the general's good quali
ties was subscribed to by the mother and
two sisters, and for the purpose of refer
ence may be styled Exhibit A, as the law
yers say.
It is given as a prelude to the narrative
which here follows. As the sister Mamie
preserved the thread of her story with
more steadfastness than the others used,
aud being coinniissioued to till the speak
ing part, her languaee is employed to il
lustrate what followed :
"Tue general was the best friend we
ever had, and Lillie loved him and he
loved her. We knew all the time that he
was married. Yes, mother knew it, and
we all acKowledge that Lillie was of age
and understood the general's position.
So many handsome things were given to
Lillie and she seemed to be so prosperous
and happy, that her friends would ask
about her good fortune. They would ask
her, 'Who is your gentleman friend?' and
of course she bad to make some reply, and
usually said: 'A man to whom I am en
gaged.' It was nobody's business, but of
course you Know how inquisitive some
people are. Dr. Cranz, our dentist, to
whom we did owe a bill of $500, was the
most inquisitive. Lillie told him that the
man she was engaged to was name 1
Manuel. Of course Cranz wanted his
money and was carious.
"One day in tue dental chair Lillie took
out her watch to note the hour. On the
faceot the watch is a picture of General
Barillas. Dr. Cranz, with the opportun
ity he had of leaning over her head whiie
she was in the chair, saw the picture ana
exclaimed: -That's not Manuel. That's
General Barillas.'
"Then he went on to say that Barillas
had any number of cirls and did not care
for any one here. He told Lillie that she
was a fool to believe in himâ that he had
rejected her and taken np another. Lillie
was then much disturbed because the gen
eral had not responded to letters request*

ing money, which she bad written ' some
time before." - -â â â . â¢ -. â¢â¢â¢.. . -
The thread of the. narrative may be
! broken here to explain that the general,
i according to the statements of Lillie and
her mother, had told the family, prior to
his departure, that if they ever needed
i friendship or assistance, to write to him,
assuring them that he would respond with
the greatest pleasure.
Mamie; duly corrected and refreshed,
proceeded to narrate in this style: .
"Dr. Cranz was the most active in pre
judicing Lillie against the general. He
said Barillas was the biggest fish in the
market and that he could be made to pay
an immense sura of money for trifling
; with Lillie'B affections, and would rather
pay than undergo exposure. Crauz finally
persuaded Lillie to proceed against the
general. She was made to believe for a
j time that the general had been false and
i treacherous. '
"Dr. Cranz," continued the narrator,
"was so deeply interested and active that
he ran off to engage a lawyer and consult
with his iriend, Dr. Ed Perranlt. Dr. Per
rault said he knew a man in whom Lillian
could place implicit trust, and that was
Henry P. Dimond."
j "And did you bring suit against the
I general?" asked the reporter.
"Not exactly- a suit," was the reply,
"but we did gi-ve Dimond some pictures of
the general and letters which he wrote to
Lillio and Dimond has them now. He
has refused to return them. Oh, but 10
go back to Cranz and Perraultâ why. they
were so anxious to go on with the suit
that Dr. Perrault pat up the money for
the costs. "We couldn't stop the suit.- â 
"When we saw that we were being used
as instruments to further a shameful
scheme to blackmail General Barillas we
tried to abandon the proceedings that
Lillian had begun. Dimond was engaged
by Cranz, and Dimond himself employed
Merzbach & Thornton. About thin time
Dr. Perranlt put up $250. Then Mr. Gunst
sent for Lillian and advised the engage
ment of Aech & Rothchild. â  â  â¢ ' .
"Dimond was to receive a contingent
one-half of the money received from the
general.' Dr. Ed Perrault was to get one
third and pay Merzbach & Thornton.
Rothchild & Ach were to get 10 per cent
of what we received and 10 per cent of
Dimond's fee. Cranz wanted $10,000 and
the settlement of his bill.
"The lawyers of Dimond, Ach and
Merzbach & Thornton, went to Mr.
Hirsch, the agent of General Barillas.
Hirscb is with Castle Brothers. He wrote
to General Barillas, and the general said
he bad, never wronged Lillie, and ordered
his attorneys to fight to the bitter end.
"We then went to Rein stein & Eisner
ana made a full statement of all the facts,
i acknowledging that we knew that the
i general was a married man. 'All along
Dimond bad cautioned us against such
acknowledgment. He would Insist that
Lillie should not know that the general
was married."
"Did your mother sign this acknowledge
merit if" â 
"Yes," said Mamie, breaking down:
"Did Lillian sign a statement?"
"Yes," was the reply; "and I signed
one." " *,f ' â  'â â¢ V . â¢
The three women insisted that there was
no thought'of getting money from Hirsch
for sign ing. .; .
Lillian said: "I signed ! it because I
loved the general and was resolved at any
sacrifice to undo the wrong which had
been done to him. We were deceived and
led inio this suit. -Dimond refused to
give up the letters which he obtained in
confidence." â  >.'â â  -/:â â  â¢ - ,-.
Mamie Blair said here: "We found that
the general never received Lillian's let
ters^ They were intercepted by unothet
girlâ May Taber." " â¢
Mamie was asked if Lillian was the gen
eral's girl in the sense that the term is
used when a man is giving to the girl
large sums of money.
"Yes," was the reply.
-' "Did your mother know that?"
. "Yes. ".'-'â 'â  - :- / '
. "In what Rums did the general give Lil
lian moneyâ $500 or so at a time? '
"Yes, when she needed that much."
"Did he provide her with a suite of
rooms?" -tjUw; %â â  ~-r;> â .â¢â .â¢ - .- ;â -.- -:,...â  â¢ .
I "No.". : . : .:â  ' .
"Was the true relation of tha general
and Lillian acknowledged to Hirsch in
the papers which Eelnstein & Eisner
hold?"
'â¢The whole truth was told. We were
willing to sacrifice everything to undo the
great wrons against the general. We
never thought of receiving money for this.
We did it as an act justice because Gen
eral Barillas was the best friend we ever
had.
"Oh, we have had trouble enough,"
said the mother and sisters, "but we
could never consent to this great wron?,
no matter what sacrifice was involved.
This is the truth and nothing but the
truth." â¢

The new gnnboat Marietta had her reg
ular engineer's trial on the bay yesterday.
Friday she was speeded up and down the
bay in order to get her engines into work
ing order, but yesterday she was opened
up and a thorough test made. An aver
age ot 13>Â£ knots is claimed for her, which
is considerably above the speed required
by the Government, so the Union Iron
Works people are figuring on a nice little
bonus. The Marietta is a handsome ves
sel of her class and the clean manner in
which she made her way through the
water was the subject of favorable com

of her trial trip has not been set, bnt
Captain C. Miner Goodall, who has been

Bonita yesterday state that with the wind

for a week past the ship could not make
port. Then again otiiers point to the (act
that the Charmer, which left New York
after her, is on her way home atrttin. hav

time. The British ship Howth. w .ich
passed her off the Horn, has been in port
for thirty days, while the St. David, which
left the East long after her, has nearly pot
all her cargo on Harrison-street wharf.
When last heard from the Dirigo was in
latitude 56 south, 64 west, and according to
the captain of the Howth, a heavy wester
ly gale sprang up shortly afterward. The
wind blew with terrific violence ana the
British ship was thrown on her beam
ends. The bad weather lasted for three
days an.i the Howth had a terrible time of
it. Seafaring men advance three proposi
tions. First, the Dirigo may have put
into Port Stanley in distress; second, Ca
ptain Goodwin may have put about and is
coming to San Francisco via the Cape of
Good Hope, and third, that being a slow
ship she may even now be somewhere in
the vicinity of this port The under
writers think that the vessel has gon#>

extent of 20 per cent on the result.

STREETCAR TRAILERS.
Eight of Them Have Been Placed In
Service on the Kearny- btre at
Line.
Eight of the Kearny and Mission-street
cars are now carrying trailers during the
busy hours of the nieht and morning.
Trailers were first attached to the Mission
street cars about a year ago, and proved
so satisfactory that they are now running
on eleven cars of that line.
Last January the system was also
adopted on the Third and Kentucky-street
line, which operates five trailers, and on
Monday the trailer was installed on the
Kearny and Mission-street line.
Each trailer has a seating capacity for
twenty-two passengers.
They would have been put on the
Kearny-street line sooner, but the steep
grade on Kearny street above Montgomery
avenue precluded their use beyond that
point. To overcome tms a sidetrack has
been laid at the point named and there
the trailer is dropped by the northbound
car and later picked up by the car coming
the other way.
The trailers are now being lighted with
oil lamps, but arrangements are nearly
completed for eiectric-light illumination
for them by transmitting the current from
the motor-car.
DESERTED THEIR CHILD.
Â£. Bolte and Wife Left Their Little
Daughter on the Street.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children made an
investigation yesterday of a peculiar case
of desertion. Louie Bolte and family on
Friday was evicted from their home at 4
August alley, near Green and Powell
streets. Bolte, with bis wife and one
child, aced 7 years, immediately went to
Eagle avenue, near Webster street, in
Alameda, leaving the other child, Marie,
12 years of age, aione on the streets ot San
Francisco. The little girl wandered
around North Beach crying until taken in

Clay street and notified the society.
Colonel Parnell, the secretary, statei
that the deserted child is in good hands
and that hereafter the society will look
after the little one's interests. He says
that there is a State law which deals
severely with parents who desert their

BRODERICK WILL FIGHT.
Dees Not Believe the New
Teachers' Pension Law
Constitutional.
Inf ;rms an I quiring Committee That
It Had Better App.y to
the Courts.
Miss Manning and other members of the
committee recently appointed by the
Teachers' Annuity and Retirement Fund
Commission to pass on applications for
pensions under the new law called on
Auditor Broderick yesterday to discus^
the workings of the act and see what could
bs done to make it legal in the eyes of the
Auditor.
Mr. Broderick has intimated that he
will refuse to sign demands for pensions
under the new law, because he believes it
to be unconstitutional, in that it will, if
carried out, trransfer public funds into
the control of a semi-public body over
which the Board of Supervisors â the
legislative body of the Cityâ has no juris
diction.
Mr. Broderick told the ladies that he
thought he would refuse to sign demands,
and have the whole mutter tested in the
courts. They argued the point with him,
but he stated that while it was not impos
sible that lie would change his mind be
thought that they bad better prepare for
a legal settlement of the questions in
volved.
Another matter that he discussed with
them was the transfer of certain funds
collected under the old law into the hands
of the present commission.
An attempt was made some time ago to
make the transfer by a simple demand on
trie treasury, which was presented for the
Auditor's signature. He refused to ap
prove it, and yesterday told the ladies to
apply to tie Board of Supervisors for a
transfer of the money, tuat being the only
legal way of getting into a position where
it could be paid out to the waiting pen
sioners.

SUDDENLY BLIND
FROM CIGARETTES
Terrible A fl ction of Sam
uel F. Morris, a Col
lector.
His Sight Leaves Him on the
Street and One Eye Is
Gone.
The Sprirg Valley Water Company,
for Whom He Work d, Has
Pensioned Him.
Samuel F. Morris, better known among
a large circle of friends as "Sam" Morris,
is the victim of a strange malady that has
thus far baffled the skill of prominent
specialists who have tried to relieve him.
He has been strlcKen suddenly blind
through the use of tobacco in the form of
cigarettes and is living only in hopes that
perhaDS one of his optics may be restored
to at least partial use.
Mr. Morris is, or rather was, a collector
for the Spring Valley Water Company,
and was well known in the business dis
tricts, where his daily duties called. He
was a constant user of the seductive rolls
of paper and tobacco that have *uch an im
mense sale in this City. Morris was
warned that his eyes would not stand per
sistent smoking, but he paid no attention
to his friends.
One day a few weeks ago, while walking
along Montgomery street, he was seen to
suddenly throw his hands out in front of
him, as if to ward off some impending
danger, and clasp them over his eyes. He
staggered against the wall of a building
and a friend wl:o saw his evident distress
asked him what was the matter.
"Why, I can't see anything," answered
tbe collector in frightened tones. He was
helped into the establishment of another
friend and from there was taken to his
home, at 1112>Â£ Hyde street, wberehe re
sides with his laui-.y.
An eminent eye-specialist who was
calied in pronounced tbe case one of nico
tine poisoning of the optic nerve and gave
little hope ot recovery. A consultation of
physicians was held later and it was
finally stated that while one eye was com
pletely gone the other might be partially
restored to sight after the sympathetic
disturbance caused by tbe poisoned eye
bad subsided.
Since being afflicted Mr. Morris has had
little recreation beyond an occasional trip
to tbe Cliff House in the care of his sister.
These journeys seem to do bim good.
Having been nineteen years and more in
the employ of the Spring Valley Water
Company he comes under their pension
regulations and receives his salary of $150
per month as though he was collecting
every day.
The rase is considered somewhat re
markable fiom the suddenness of the at
tack and the physicians are keeping a
close watch on it in the interest of their
science, as well as for the patient's wel
fare. The afflicted man is remarkably
patient under his burden of darkness and
greets his friends, who call to ask after his
t>ea)th, with a cheery smile.
It is the intention of Morris' physicians
to send him to the springs for a lime to
see whetner tbe change will not benefit
him.
BIG CLOSING SALE.
The Mace Crowded to the Doors With
Bargain- Hunters Eager to Take Ad
v intage of an Important Event.
Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock saw the
great closing-out sale of the Maze inaugu
rated under circumstances, which, to say
the least, must have appeared flattering to
the management.
It was responded to by thousands of
people and all day lone the store was
packed to its utmost capacity with people
who appreciated the good things that
were on sale.
It is to be regretted that a concern of
this magnitude was obliged to retire from
the tiel.i of its usefulness.
But since this had been decided upon
and the announcement made that it was
to be a closing out sale, giving up busi
ness, that representation wan received
witti sincerity by the purchasing masses
and the response thereto was hitherto
unequaled. The merit of the sale was
best advertised by the people who at
tended and their expressions on leaving
the store. The sale will continue until the
stock is sold down to where it can be sold
in a lump to some other merchant.

The Committee Does Not Think
the Pastor Ought to Go
Under Fire.
He Is Asked to Remain in the Pulpit
for tbe Good of the
Church
A committee of the Emanuel Baptist
Clmrch has urged Rev. J. George Gibson
to withdraw bis resignation.
Gommitteemen Tabcr, Daub, Dimmick,
Bryant and Davis had a meeting at the
resilience of Mr. Taber last night. After
fully discussing the condition of the or
ganization and the services of their pas
tor the committee decided that it would
be for the best interests of the church for
the pastor to continue his services.
Speaking of the meeting Mr. Taber
said: "We huve decided to invite Mr.
Gibson to continue his pastorate, and we
have instructed our secretary to wire him
a letter expressing our views. That letter
will reach him on Monday morninc, and
we hope he will decide to continue his
work with us."
It is not known just why the pastor
wanted to leave the church. Durrant's
attorneys have a theory which is diractlr
in conflict with that of the members of the
church, and it is said that the committee
wiil urge him not to leave while under
rire, even if he will not consent to remain
permanently.

That Opens Under
His Cravat.
âºHas a Tube in His Side for
Carrying Food to H ; s
Stomach.
Peca'iar Predicament of an Inma'e
cf the Almshouse Who Sought
to Ccmmit Suicide.
Captain Keddy has an exceedingly in
teresting subject under his charge at the
Almshouse m the person of Daniel
liayba.
Daniel Bayha ia a tall, slim, very pale
ana not "unlikely looking" young man of
oO years. Two years ago he was working
on a ranch in Yolo County, became de
spondent, tired of life, as he says, and
drew a knife across his throat. The wind
pipe was severed. What medical service
the neighborhood afforded was called,
and bis life was saved. He was afterward
takea to a hospital up there, where he lay
nbout a month. He was in a bad way.
Kecovering sufficiently to admit of trav
eling, he was brought to this City and
DANIEL BAYHA, Who Cut His Throat and Now Has a Tube in
His Throat to Breathe Through and Another in Hi; Side
Connecting With His Stomach Through Which He Is Fed.
Bent to the German Hospital. He could
breathe only with great difficulty, and
witn greater difficulty was the thinnest
kind of nourishment administered to him.
Dr. Morse, surgeon cf the hospital, recog
nized a subiect for hi 3 special care.
As Bayha entered tlieofticeof the Alms
house yesterday in response to the call of
a vii-itor he presented the appearance de-
Bcrined â that of a young man who might
be convalescing from a week or two's ill
ness, rather than one who had, in his at
tempt at suicide, nearly cut his head oft.
"When spoken to he placed the forefinger
o. ( his right hand to his throat, under a
scarf he r.ore about his neck, before re
plying. The linger had covered the end
of a tub? that carried air to his lunes, and,
open, would have prevented him from
speaking. He has worn that tube for
nearly two years since the operation in
the hospital and has become entirely ac
customed to it. The wound in the neck
has quite healed. A silver socket is held
In place by a string around the neck and
tbroogb this the tube connects with the
windpipe, it being possible by this means
to remove the tube at will.
But this is not tne most rpmarkable
thine about Mr. Bayha. The tube in the
throat interferes with his eating, and for
a long time made it impossible. For the
purpose of giving him nourishment,
therefore, another tube was inserted
directly through his side into his stomach.
To this was attached a rubber hose abcut
a foot and a half in length. For a long
time after the operation Mr. Bay ha's food
was administered to him through this
tube directly into the stomach. For some
months past he lias found it unnecessary
to use this, however, as the conditions at
his throat have so improved that ne can
Âtake semi-liquid food through the natural
channel.
Unable to work, Bayha has spent most
of his time lately at the Alm<Â»nouse. He
is an interesting subject for medical stu
dents, and is in frequent demand at
clinics. He says that lie hopes to be able
to get rid of' the stomach tnoe, and if so
declares his ability to earn his own livinj .
He has entirely recovered from his de-
Bpondency, and, handicapped as he is,
feels disposed to live as long as he may.
MAKE-BELIEVE MATERIALS.
Marble That in Not Marble and Carved
Wood That I* Not Wood.
Shams and imitations of all kinds are i
placed upon the market, and the imita- i
tions range in all brunches and lines of i
business, lrom skim milk which mas- I
querades as cream to the piece of glass {
which has to do service as a "real dia
mond." These frauds are transparent to
a great part of the population, and the
gham jewelry, sham fur and the humbugs
cenerally are palmed off on that class of j
the population which would rather have
an imitation than nothinp, or upon the
rural visitor who lives in blissful ignorance
of many tricks of the various trades. But
some of the great metropolitan buildings
which have been erected recently have
within their walls shams in the way of
decorations, which are so well made, so
artistically constructed, that they are
looked upon as genuine by men to whom
the average sham is an open book. In a
building which was recently erected in the
resident part of the city there are groups
and columns which look 10 the casual ob
server like shatts of highly colored marble,
seamed and veined so intricately anu
colored so harmoniously that a person '
with, appreciation lor the" beauuiul coula i
1 not help noticing them and praising their
i beauty.
â¢â¢But they are not marble," said one
! who knew ail about the builder's shams.
! "They are not eviti stone. The highly
' polished columns arc made of iron and
| decorated to imitate marble."
"But i ho surface feels like stone, and
' not nt all like metal."
"It ia not metal nor is it stone," was the
experts reply. "Over the surface of the
â  iron column there is a coaling, the chief
; ingredient of which is powdered marble.
j Tiiis coating is several inches thick and
; becomes a solid, homogeneous mass, sus
cej tib!e to the highest polish; and when I
it has been rubViPd down, and painted its I
i general appearance will deceive most !

In the same building there are cornices j

GIRLS AS OFFICE-BOYS.
They Are Crowding Out the Dime
Novel Heading Youngster.
The rising generation of femininity has
been invading fields hitherto regarded as
I peculiarly those of the boy, ju-t as her
' older sister, the new woman, i;as been ac
ceptably rilling positions, situations and
i professions whicn were formerly regarded
as =uitable only for the male sex. The
' office-girl has appeared in Chicago the
> last few months to take her place beside
| the army of women stenographers and
, typewriter*.
Koo::e knows exactly who began the
; innovation. Perhaps t lie idea was bor
j rowed from the bin department stores,
i which employ cash girls almost exclu-
sively. A few years ago these stores used
to employ boys, and cash girls were sel
dom seen. But in course of time the cash
girls b came more and more popular,
until tiie cash boy is now the exception,
while the cash girl is the rule.
Mucb the same transition is predicted
in the ranics of office boys. The old
fashioned office boy, who swear*, smokes
cigarettes and is impertinent usually, and
reads dime novels in a corner or loals
when he is on some important er
rand, is fast disappearing, and it is nre
dicted that in course of time the office
girl will have entirely taken his place.
Office girl* are now employed in a num
ber of the oflict-s in the big buildings down
: town. The aucces< of the.r sibters has
; suggested the idea to other giris oi invad
i ing the iield hitherto monopolized by their
i brothers and earning more wages than are
; paid to the cash girl. Every now and then
: a man who has put an advertisement for
| an office boy in the paper umls among the
applicants a letter from a girl, or if h'_
asks that the boy apply in person one or
more girls are apt to be among the score of
; youngsters who answer the advertisement.
At first the man does not take kindly to
the idea, and the would-be office trirl finds
I it difficult work to secure a place. The
: men are prejudiced against tha idea, just
as at tir-t the men were prejudiced against
the idea of employing women as steno
graphers or typewriters.
Those who have bad office girls in their
employ are, however, very well pleased
i with them, and most of them who have
j tried office girls declare that never again
will they have an office boy around the
! premises.
Most of the office cirls are ambitious.
They are like the office boy of a genera
tion or two ago wbo entered the employ
of his master with a determination to rise
to tne topmost notch. They realize that
in tins day every occupation is open to
them, and that they themselves may be
j lawyers, banker", brokers, insurance
'agents or anything else, if they are able
to master tne details of tne business.
Tliev therefore keep their eyes open and
i learn all that they can about the buiiness,
! that they may pur the ideas so gamed into
practice when there shall be an opportu
nity, some years in the future, for them to
go into business^of some sort for them
! selves.
Most o! the office girls immediately be
gin to qualify themselves for promotion.

The Grand Lodge of OJd Fellows con
cluded its labors last evening and ad
journed until next year.
A proposition loosing to the establish
ment of an aged Odd Fellows' fund was
referred for action to toe next Grand
Lod-e.
The Odd Fellows' free employment bu
reau reported that it had found places for
200 applicant*, and that tue cot of main
taining the bureau hud been $315 for the
year.
George H. Morrison, P. G. M., chair
man of the committee on the Odd Fel
lows' Home, presented the report of the
committee. The committee found that
the home is in good condition, that the
trustees administered its affairs con-
â¢cientiously and honestly, that the furni
ture also is in good condition, but sug
gested that there should be a tire drill. It
also recommended that there should be a
change in the superintendent, matron,
physician and nurse.
Perm^sion was given to Superintendent
Bartlett to address the Grand Lodge, but
he declined to make any statement.
On motion of Trustee Tox of ihe home
the recommendations in the report were
adopted.
This will bring: about the removal of
Superintendent Bartlett, his wife the
matron. Dr. Kar.-ner the physician and
Miss cjteuart the iiurse.
The money in the home fund belonging
to the Orphans' Home was ordered paid
over to the orphanage. This amounts to
about $1700.
A resolution was adopted to the effect
tkat none out wuiie labor be employed at
the home, particularly in the laundry.
The per capita tax for the maintenance
of the home wa* fixed at 60 cents. This
will net $15,500, which together with
$4000 on hand will make $1'J,500 to run the
huiiie for the ensuing year.
In answer to a question as to why eighty
acres of land b.'longinjr to ths home are
not utilized it was sta'.ed that the piece is
fit only fur citrus fruits, and that it would
take a long time to make the land pro
ductive, but if oranges and citrus fruits
were planted the product of the land
would be $lW per acre.
it was resolved that the minimum of
pick benefits should be only $2 per week
after a eicfc member shall have received
$300.
ihe trustees of the Odd Fellows' Home
were instructed to lurnisu the Grand
Lodge at euch session an it mized ac
count of moneys received and expended.
It was decided that an accused member
of the order may be tried before the near
est lodge.
The bonds of the grand secretary and
grand treasurpr were fixed at $10,000 each.
The lo. lowing appointed officers to
gether with the elective officers were in

TWO LAWYERS' BILLS.
Attorney* Whftworth and Rotlnchild
Sne Former Clients for Feei.
Attorney John M. Whitworth thinks
that bis client, John F. More, has not
been sufficiently liberal in the payment
of fees and has sued for a balance of
$12,021 40 aliened to be due.
Mr. Wuitworth has assigned his claim
to Lloyd P. Larue for collection. It is
aliened in the comphiint that Mr. More
employed Mr. Wiutworlh to repreaeatj
him in the somewhat noted li tig ition in
volved In the settlement of the WiHiam
P. More $1,000,000 estate, in which John
F. More appeared as one of his heirs.
Mr. Whit worth so ably represented the
interests of his client that he secured the
ujipointment ol *aid client as general tid
tninistrator of the estate of Alexander P.
More, a position that will veld good fees;
yet client has paid only $'iUOO as nt
torney's fees, and though oiten requested
to do so has declined to pay any more.
He will be called on to justiiy his refusal
in court.
John H. Wise was not able to agree
upon the Jee demanded by Joseph Koths

OHTJRCH-GOING IN ICELAND.
BHck-Cnuntry Folk Who Travel Many
Miles to Uivinp Worship.
Jessie Ackerman, in the fourth of her
unicles on "Three Women in Iceland," in
the January Woman's Home Companion,
tells now she attended a country church
in the northern part of the island.
"The Sabbath day was lull of interest,
for we had not attended service in the
rural districts. In the early morning we
betook ourselves to the front of tha house
to watch tlie country folk assemble. Ih
the distance we saw them fording tlie
river in a long line, and in the other direc
tion men, women and children rode slow. y
over the mountains down to the form.
"What the sabbath day means to ihese
people few can realize, borne of them
never see a facp besides tho3e of the metn
iiers of the fumily from one church
day until the other. What wonder, then,
tnat they began to assemble fully two
hours before church time! A peculiar
form of salutation prevails outside of the
cities. With this we had not yet been
made familiar, and our astonishment can
well be imagined when we saw the men
dismount, embrace and kiss each other. I
learned later that this is the only form of
salutation among men in the inland dis
tricts.
"The honr of service arrived, ana, in
company with the preacher, who wore a
high hat, a loose, flowing gown buttoned
from chin to bern, and a great white E'iza
beth ruff around his neck, we entered the
church. From the back seat we had full
view of the congregation, and, not being
familiar with the language, the time was
passed in meditation on the situation.
"In the pulpit the pastor was assisted
into a long, white robe, which fell over
the black one, and down his back hung a
large surplice of bright velvet, upon wheh
a golden cross was wrought. On tne altar
two great candles about a yard long and
three inches thick shed a dim light.
These were the especial charge of an offi
cial who gave out the hymns, and between
times snuffed the candles with an old
time pair of 'snuffers.' After church the
worshipers dispersed anil many of them
did not reach their homes until night."
WARDROBE OF AN EMPEROR.
Kaiser William's Is Probably the Most
Extensive in the World.
It is not easy /or the average person to
form an idea of the dimensions of the
wardrobe of him of Germany, borne sort
of the list of his possessions in this respect
has recently been made out, and from
this it appears that, to be^in with, his
Majesty possesses a uniform of every regi- i
incut in the Prussian army, with the hel- I
mets, caps, epaulets, swords, etc., en
btiite. Over and above this, the Emperor,
being the heal of an endless number of
regiments in Bavaria, Wurtembure, Sax
ony. Baden and Hesse, a complete uni
form of each of these hangs in his clothes
presses. But this is not all. Two rooms
at the palace in Benin are entirely filled
with uniforms of the regiments in Austria,
Sweden, England, Italy and other coun
tries which "beiong to" William 11. To
these must be added the uniforms of the
admirals of the British and the Swedish
fleets.
As for the clothes which the Emperor
wears when he is not en grande tenue,
these also are bewildering in number.
There are the ordinary suits for tbe morn
iner, noon and night, during the warm and
cold seasons; the hunting suits and uni
forms, which latter tbe Emperor has in
troduced for tbe use of himself and his
courtiers; the uniforms of tbe English
and German ytcht clubs, lawn tennis
clubs, etc. To each suit belong special
hats, gloves, cravats and canes. The Em
peror's body linen is, again, especially
made to "go with" tne various suits of
clothes, and there are whole packing-eases
full of the pins, rings, studs, etc.
The keeper of this private "museum,"
who is, as a rule, a superannuated valet,
has under him a number of men well
versed in the art of the needle. These do
what little mending there is to be done,
iv the way of sewing on button*, braids
and ornaments. But thonÂ«h his Majesty
has so extensive a wardrobe he is most
parsimonious concerning it, and the uni
forms specially are treated with great con
sideration. New collars and cuffs are
added three or four times to the ordinary
uniforms before a coat is "done wit<>," and
not an article of clothing is ever wasted.
The German and other loreign orders in
the Emperor's possession are estimated at
Â£50,0J0, and when the "traveling Em
peror" goes abroad there are among n is
luggage some iron cases containing a selec
tion of orders representing the sum of
Â£3000.â Westminster Budget.
NO BOTTOMLESS LAKES.
The IÂ»iT|irit Are I.Â«>hh Than 2500 Feet,
and One of Them la in Oregon.
The deepest body of fresh water in
America Is Crater Lake, Oregon. Only
ue lake in the world â Lake Baikal â ex
ceeds it in depth, and is only 400 leet
deeper. Until recently it was asserted
Crater Lake was bottomless, but sound
ings nave shown its greatest depth to be
2000 feet. It is' rive miles in diameter,
nearly circular, and occupies the crater of
an extinct volcano.
No tish h.-i- ever been known to exist in
Crater Lake. Recently a club of mountain
climbers, with headquarters at Portland,
sent to Washington a request that Crater
Lake be stocked with trout, and the Gov
ernment experts are going to rind out if
such a scheme i 9 practicable, It is easy
enough to put trout into the water, but the
question is if there is sufficient food in the
water to nourish them after they are
there. The txperts will tow small gauze
nets over the water at all hours of the day.
Animaicuias will catch in the gauze and
from its abundance or lack it can be ascer
tained if the water contains nourish
ment.
An interesting series of experiments
will be undertaken to ascertain the tem
perature of the water at various depths.
No such obseivations have ever heeu
taken of fresh water so far down. With
this end in view a full equipment of self
reÃisteriPÃ thermometers and supplemen
tary apparatus will be taken along and let
down by sounding lines. There are very
few places in the lake where the depth is
less than 1600 feet and no lake on the
western hemisphere approaches this.
It is no wonder, then, that Crater Lake
was supposed to be bottomless. However,
tue truth is that all lakes over 150 leet
deep possess a similar reputation. Any
body of water that is deeper than the
length of the longest feeling-line is sure
to lack a bottom in the popular belief.
A first-rate example of this sort of
delusion is afforded by Fayette
Lake, in Idaho. It was formerly im
aKintd to i c bottomless, and later its
depth was officially stated to be 2000 feet.
Recent investigation proves that its great
est depth is 305 feet. They are no data on
which to baie a guess as to the bottom
temperature of Crater Lake, but the sup
position is that it will be very little above
freezing. Tne temperature of the ocean
remains at about 40 degrees Fahrenheit
nil the 3' ear round, even in the tropics.
Nevertheless, tome volcanic beat may yet
remain to warm the waters of Crater Lake.

TALK PARK
The Former Site of the Old
Jswish Cemeteries Is
Recommended.
Another EoulevarJ Proposed
Along Ancient Do' ores
Street.
Hospital Site to Be Madj Wholesome
With Lawns and Blooming
Flowers.
The subject of a park for the Mission
on the site of the old Jewish cemeteries,
or on a site of greater dimensions with a
zoological collection attached, was iully
<tiscussed at tlie meeting of the Mission
Improvement Union last night.
Ju'.lfte F. W. Van Keynegom stated that
the sentiment of the meeting was to have
a park in the thickly populated section, in
which the women and children could en
joy the sunshine and fresh nir without
ihe expense or trouble of paying car fare.
By the way of illustrating how yretty
the grounds would look if laid, out in an
artistic manner Professor Hansen, a
scenic gardener from the State University,
exemplified on charts his ideas of tin
beautiful.
Dr. John H. Miller spoke. Ha was de
cidedly opposed to the greater-par*
scheme, with wild animals at a distance
from the homes of those for wnora the
park was originally intended. He claimed
that a tract of land beyond Thirtieth
street would not be a park for the Mission
residents any more than it would lor the
people of Oakland.
George D. Shad bourne, one of the prime
movers for the greater park, gave a his
tory of the progress of the City during the
past twenty-five years and said that in
twenty-five more years there would be
1,000,000 inhabitants in this City. Then
tnere would be a necessity for larger
park?. He favored the zoological collec
tion.
Ex-Supervisor Hobbs strongly favored
the lesser park.
Thomas F. Hagerty favored the ceme
tery lots. He paid his respects to the rail
road company, which, he said, was behin 1
the scheme of locating a park where the
people would be induced to buy outside
lands.
Pulke Judge Low also favored the ceme
tery park, where the children and their
mothers could go in the evenings.
C. W, Mark offered the following resolu
tion, which was opposed by Major B. Mc-
Kinnie and T. V . O'Brien.
A. P. Van Duzer, in a Humorous speech,
pictured the mis-ry of the elephant out
in the fog. The giraffe and other animals
would have the whooping-cough, while
the Hon< and tigers would make night
mdeoiiK with their lamentations.
A. W. Thompson closed the debate,
after which the resolutions were carried
by an overwhelming majority.
The following are the resolutions:
Wiikkeas, The residents and property-own
ers of the Mission district of San Francisco are
entirely destitute of local parks or uublic
.â â¢quarts, and are fully convinced that such
places of open-air resort within the thieklv
populated portion oi tue Mission, where
nearly one-third of the population of San
Francisco heve their homes, are dni.y
li'toniinj a more imperative necessity
lor the health, comfort and enjoyment of
the residents of that part of San Francisco;
and whereas, the growth of this part of San
Francisco most favored by climatic influences
will leeve no laud available lor use as such
parks except ut an enormous expense unless
prompt action is taken by the City authorities
lo secure the same. Therefore be it.
Resolved, By the residents and taxpayers of
tbe Mission fn public meeting assembled, that
the honorable Uoard of Supervisors of the
City and County of Han Francisco are hereby
respectfully nquesteJ to make provision for
a reasonable appropriation in the next
tax levy to provide one or more
small parks within convenient walk
ing distance of the homes of. the district,
wheie women Hnd children can resort to en
j..y tne open air aud sunshine, without the
necessity of paying carfare to reach distant
pens of "the City possessing a less genial cli
mate. It is further
Rcfolvf.ti, That we respectfully recommend
! the two blocks of land between Eighteenth
and Twentieth, Dolores and Church streets,
and lying In from of the Mission high School,
now being erected, boing within ten min
utes' walk of 30,000 residents, be
secured by the City for one of such
parks, if the same can be purchased for a rea
sonable price, and that Dolores street, which
runs along the front of said blocks, should be
Improved as a "Mission boulevard" with flow
ers aud bhrubbcry Hiong the tenter thereof, it
is further
Rctolvrd, That the block of land now occu
pied by the City and County Hospital should
be converted into a public garden or park,
and that the City should take the legal steps
necessary to assert its title to the strip of land
lying between Mission and West Mission
streets and take possession, of the same for a
like purpose. It Is further
Resolved, That tue secretary of this meeting
bo instructed to at once forward a copy of

THE SAEMAZAOHY GOSPEL.
A Sixth Century Greek Manuscript In
the St. Petersburg L.lbrÂ»ry.
The other day the Emperor Nicholas II
made the Public Imperial Library at St.
Petersburg a very valuable present, viz.,
the Sarmazachy Gospel, written on pur
ple parchment, a Greek manuscript gos
pel of the sixth century, not a whit infe
rior in scientific value to the Sinai Bible of

already offered the above-mentioned com
munity Â£1200 for it. Ihe latter wished,
however, that the precious manuscript
should not pnss into any but orthodox
hands. The Archreoiogicai In'titute in
formed the Public Imperial Library at
St. Petersburg of the precious diÂ«ccvery,
but its means were too limited to permit
its keepers to entertnin the thought of
buying the treasure. Then the Russian
Embassidor, M. da Nelidoff, applied to
the Grand Duke Constantine Constantino
vich, president of the Imperial Academy
of Science, with the request that ho would
draw the attention of the Czar to the rare
manuscript, ana immediately ater orders
were given to buy it for his Majesty.
It is an interesting fact that there was
talk for some time in the spring of pre
s=>ntin* the Sa.mazachy Guspel to the
Emperor as a coronation gift. It is writ
ten iv letters of silver, in two columns of
sixteen lines, on finely wrought red parch
ment of a slightly violet tinge. Only the
words "God" and "Jesus Christ" an 1 the
titles of the various Â«ections are written in
letters of gold. Unfortunately, in the
course of centuries more tnan half of the
precious leaves have been lost. It is writ
ten on 182 leaves, which now rest in a
book cover made in 1820. The Russian
Archaeological Institute in Constanti
nople examined it, and found that it
forms an important part of the famous
Purple Gospel which Tschendorf desig
nated as Purple Codex N, and of which
only forty-rive leaves have hitberto been
known. Six of them are in the Vati
can Library, two in Vienna, four in Lon
don and tnirty-tbree in the Convent of
John the Divine in the island of Patmos.
It was further ascertained that many
leaves were wanting, even so long ago as
the twelfth and tourteenth centuries. The
above-mentioned leaves found their way
to the Vatican and to Vienna in the seven
teenth century.
The complete manuscript must have con
sisted of forty-nine stitched parts of ten
sheets each. Very few manuscripts on pur
ple parchment have come down to our
time. It is, thÂ°refore, easy to understand
how hlehly they are valued, and the Sar
niazachy Gospel is also especially import
ant in textual and palrcological respects.
The very high importance attached to the
Purple Codex in Europe is clear from the
fact (if from no other) that tne Vatican
Library presented Leo XIII, with s'X
splendidly mounted leaves of It on his
jubilee day. The Sarmazachy Gospel is
veneiated by the population of Anatolia as
a sacred thing, and before it was sent to
the Russian embassy at Constantinople
large numbers of tne inhabitants went to
show their reverence for it for the last
time. â London Standard.

What Has Been Done for Others
Can Be Done for You,
WE ARE LIVING IN AN ERA OP NEW DISCOVERIES AND NEW INVEN-
Â»Â» tions, many of which seem almost miracu'ous. Devices and convenience* that
would a quarter of a century ago have been looked upon as impossibilities are now
regarded as every -day, matter-of-fact necessities of life. Of a few are the type-setting
machine, telephone, phonograph, kinetoscope, etc. While the arts and sciences have
kept up a merry race for supremacy and leadership in the matter of progress,
medicine, the most important one of all in its relation to the human race, has made
as great if not greater advances than any other. While, formerly the. treatment of
I disease was in many particulars a matter of experiment, it is now an accurate science .
I by reason of the valuable researches of the distinguished physicians who are. carrying
!on the beneficent work of the State Electro-Medical Institute. The entire career of
this institution has been one of constant progress and triumph over disease. Many
! sick people whose cases had been pronounced hopeless by well-known physicians have
I been permanently cured by the electro-medical treatment. In seeking the services of
the eminent specialists of this Institute the sick and suffering can feel assured beyond
all doubt that they are taking no chances or making no experiments. When the
Institute doctor* tell a patient they can cura him they always do cure. This truth is
vouched for now by thousands of grateful patients, who have been restored to health
by this new treatment.

ADMINISTERING TO A PATIENT WITH THE STATIC ELECTRIC MA CHINK
AT THE STATE ELECTRO-MEDICAL INSTITUTE. . ;: \
The secret of this mastery of disease is a simple one. They have by study and
research originated a well-defined system of treatment, combining electricity and'
medicine, known as the "Electro-Medical" treatment, which has made so many
wonderful cures that the State Electro-Medical Institute has become celebrated in the
short period of six months. It has made cures when either medicine alone or elec-
tricity alone would have failed. Thus the combined Electro-Medical treatment marks
the same degree of progress in the healing science that has been made within the past
decade in the other sciences.
A step has been taken ahead of the times. Physicians who have been content to
work on ancient lines and plod along in the one old rut ana use none but remedies
and appliances of a century ago may scoff at the progressive, up-to-date physician;
but the latter ; is the one who cures, and, consequently, the one whom the sick are
looking for.

THE OLDEST ENGLISH PAPER.
It Is the Condon "Gazette"â PublUhed
ilrst In 1665.
The oldest English ue wspaper is, though
few people know it, the London Gazette,
which was, on its hm publication on No
vember 14, 1605, known as the Oxford Ga
zette, from the fact of the Parliament sit
ting at Oxford. This name was changed,
on February 5, 1665, to the present one.
But though the London Gazette contains
some items of much interest to certain
people, such as those who have received
"honors" at the hands of royalty, or those
whose bankruptcies are announced, it is
not a newspaper in the usual sense of the
term; that is, as being read generally by
the pubiic.
The honor of being the oldest newspaper
of tbn class in the British Isles, and hence
probably in the world, may be unhesitat
ingly awarded to Berrow's Worcester
Journal, which made its appearance in
1690, ten years before the beginning of the
eighteenth century. It has always had a
wide circulation among the higher classes
of its district, and is to-day as vigorous as
ever. But whei it first came out it was
not under its presant name, and this fac
tor is of importance in considering its
claim to the premier honors of the journal
istic world.
Perhaps we ought to award the palm of
being the doyen of English journals to the
Lincoln, Rutland ami Stamford Mercury
still published weekly at Stamford. This
paper, has now, as ever, a truly great cir
culation and an enormous influence In the
Eastern Midland District. Its title is ex
actly the same to-day as it was on the day
it was tirst published 174 years aco. Hence
this important factor should almost assign
to it the first place among extant iiews-
papers.
There is in the Leicester Museum a copy
of the 1719 issue consisting of four paces
demi quarto, its style that of the old
news letter. In July, 1855, its circulation
h art become 14.000 a week, the highest at
that time of any paper out of London. Its
price was then twopence, but is now a
penny with a circulation of 25,000 weekly.
Thomas Cooper, the famous Chartist poet,
was on its staff in his younger days. The
political complexion of this celebrated
paper is L beral. â Answers.DANCED TO THE

A WOMAN AMONG CANNIBALS.
Miss Kingsley returns After a Year'a
Journey in thÂ« Cameroon*.
Miss Kingslay, who returned to England
in the fall of 1895, after a journey of
nearly a year in the Cameroon*, collecting
fishes, relates stories of thrilling adven
tures, particularly among the Fangwe
cannibals, living between the Ogowe and
Kembwe rivers. These people are always
at war with one another, and are one of
the few tribes in Africa that eat their own
dead. As tier little band of three Fangwe
"elephant men" and four Djuma men ap
proached each Fangwe town it was found
to he in a state of defense, and the leader
uf the band invariably fell into some trap
which the inhabitants had iaid out?ide
the town for the enemy.
At almost every town the Fangwe
stopped the expedition and wanted to eat
the Fangwe elephant men, who were of a
hostile section. Miss Kingsley had guar
anteed the elephant men safety, and
j sometimes by persuasion, sometimes by
j threats of punishment and sometimes by
i a little present they were saved. Not one
burial-place was found In the country, but
' jueces of human bodies are kept in moÂ«t j
! of Ihe native mud hut", just as civilized
i people keep eatables in their larders.
' The AijumaÂ«, on the other hard, bury
! their dead in the forest. Mis? Kingsley
I climbed the Cameron Teak, 13,700 feet

At an altitude near 10,000 feet she came

BIRDS AND KITES.
I Feathered Creatures Cannot Under
stand the Strnnge Fliers.
Many amusinj: experiences have been
the lot of the scientists who have been
manipulating kites for scientific purposes.
Large Dirds are always interested in the
>trange devices floating in the air and can
not quite make out what they are.
I'rompted by sharp curiosity they hover
around the floating kites' and subject
themselves to the danger of becoming en
tangled in the silken string and being
dragged down to earth.
No bird, however, has ever alighted on
a kite or attacked one. While one scientist
was flying a train of live kites a couple of
years ago a large silver-tipped eagle came
suddenly out of the higher air and swooped
round aud round tho first kite, looking
against the sunset sky like a huge silver
pall. A* the train of kites was pulled in
the eagle followed, visiting one kite and
then another, seeming unc?rtain just
i whut to do. In a few minutes, when he
Â«eemed to havo decided that they were
not good to eat and he knew nothing
about them, anyway, he indignantly flew
off and was lost to view.
Another experience was had with a
storK that came from the New Jersey side
of the Hudson and flew Â«traiglit for the
j queer objoct in tbe air. He apparently
liad mauo up his mind to go straight
j through it, but changed and dove under
f neath. He went around and above it, and
through a glass it could b3 seen that he
cocked his eye at the intruder in a most
comicil manner. He started away a few
hundred feet, channel his mind and c.ime
swooping back. He finally reluctantly
wen i away, mystified over this queer ad
dition to the inhabitants of the air.
While kites were high in the air one
March flocks ofeeese flying in the 15
--wedge flew over. They invariably stopped,
broke up, hovered above t lie queer object,
and at last slowly re-formed and flew away.
While tne larger oirds all c irae down from
heights above thn kites the small birds of
the air will alight on the string holding
the kite and sway to and fro.â Chicago

ThÂ« "Judge" Won the Bet.
A driver of a truck was in great distress
in t'ront of the Judge building i-riday be
cause his horse balked crosswise of the
street and caused not only a loss of his
time, but also blocked traffic. All the
usual devices to get the stuoborn animal
to move were unavailing, and a crowd
had gathered of considerable size to
watch the proceedm??. W. J. .Arkell,
proprietor of Judue, was attracted to the
scene, and he said to his brother, Bartlett,
who tat in the office: t- I will bet $100 to
10 cents that I can go ont and start that
horse in two minutes." Bartlett imme
diately took the bet, the_ money was placed
mi the hands of the private secretary, W.
J. Merrill, and the two Arkel.'s started
for the street. W. J. Arkell picked up two
handfuls uf sand and asKed the driver to
hold the horse's head still. Then he
packed ench of the horse's nostrils full of
the ;and, and almost instantly the horse
began to sneeze and start with a rush, to
the great delight of the driver, anii.i tbe
shouts of the bystander*. Mr. Arkell,
the winner, says he doesn't read the Lon
don Lancet for nothing. â New York

SENDS A CHECK
Gingerbread Fete Managers
Surprised by a Gen
erous Donation.
On Behalf of Mrs. Sprecke ] s
$5000 Is Contributed for the
Children's Sake.
To-Day Rosenthcl's F..mcus Picture,
"The Cardinal," Will B3 en View
at the Crocker Residence.
Although Toby Rosenthal's celebrated
picture "The Cardinal" will be on view
to-day from 10 a. m. to 10 p. m., the bril
liant gingerbiead fete at the Clark
Crocker residence virtually closed last
night.
The management could congratulate
itself on its decided social success, but was
somewhat doubtful as to what the finan
cial outcome would be.
But yesterday this element of doubt
was practically removed by a generous
donation received by the ladies from Claus
Spreckels. It was in the form of a check
for $5000 and was accompanied by a note
stating that the money was intended for
tbe benefit of the Children's Hospital and
Training School for Nurses and that it was
sent with the "best wishes of Mr. and
Mrs. Claus SpreckeK"
Cheered by this gift, which at once put
the balance of tbe fete on tbe right side,
the management proceeded to see that the
afternoon and evening entertainments
were fully up to the standard. Certainly
the society crowds seemed fully to enjoy
the "children's afternoon," with its show's
und songs. In the evening the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Club and soloists were
appreciated.
To-day tbe "The Carnival" will be on
view, as stated, and it is expected that
many people who had no opportunity of
seeing the famous picture during the week
will avail themselves of this opportunity.
PSEUDO-MEMOEY.
ItÂ« Manifestation* and It* Causes.
Curious Illustrations.
An Irishman once referred to what has
been called pseudo-memory as the mem
ory that he had of things that never hap
pened to him ; but a more exact definition
telis us that it consists in the belief that a
new state has been previously experienced,
so that when the state is produced for the
first time it seems familiar.
Or, as Wendell Holmes says, "all at
once a conviction flashes upon us that we
have been in the same precise circum
stances as at the present instant once or
many times before" â a sort of feeling that
makes some people think they are ghosts.
He added jocularly that the feeling can
not be the memory of a previous state of
existence, for he gives the case of a stu
dent, who, when blacking his shoes, had
the conviction that be had often done so
before, and he mentions as an explanation
the fact of the brain being a double organ.
One side of the brain receives the impres
sion before the other, and in the second
case there is the memory of the
first impression. Bnt to this view it
may be objected th:it there is a convic
tion that tne former state was experienced
a long time before, sometimes, too, with
the belief that it occured in a remote and
Otherwise forgotten past Sometimes no
doubt there is an actual memory of cir
cumstances nearly resembling the present,
at other times there is a memory of dreamÂ«.
The latter is most often the case when
some incident during the day recalls a
dream of the previous night that had been
forgotton on awaking in the morning.
Another explanation, founded on the
theory of hereditary memory, is not im
| possible, iliis would include the case or
the student who blacked his shoes. From
a scientific point of view this explanation
is perfecily rational.
A memory of thines that our ancestors
have done is consistent with strict reason
| ing, and we have something almost
amounting to memory of this kind in the
case of animals. Darwin tells of dogs
that were taken to Central America and
taught to hunt deer in a particular way ;
and the progeny of these dogs, when they
were taken out without their parents,
hunted at once according to the particular
method without being trained.
This kind of memory occurs in different
forms- A sudden turn of the road in a
strange country brings us face to face with
a landscape that seems familiar. Meeting
a person for the first time, we feel as if we
had already seen him. Reading a book
that we have never seen before, the
thoughts or the language or both seem as
if they had already been presented to the
mind. Again, when we are witnessing
! some ceremony, a funeral service, a pre
cision or some pageant, all at once the
whole scene seems familiar.
Many remarkable cases of this kind of
memory are told. An inhabitant of Mew
England, when on a visit to England,
went to see ihe home of his ancestors.
He thought he recognized the village
church and the landscape, but he believed
he iuu-st have seen a picture of them be
fore. However, on passing through the
churchyard, his attention was especially
attracted by a tombstone on which tbe
name inscribed seemed familiar. On in
quiry he discovered that the young girl
who was buried there had been engaged
to one of his ancestors, who, accurding to
an account given in a book written on the
family, used often to pay visits to the
tomb'of his loved one. Hereditary mem
ory is tbe only clew in this case, if we ex
cept a vivid imagination.
A similar story is told of a Yorkshire
man who went on a visit to Somerset, and
there recognized and remembered well
hunting the red deer. He had never done
so himself before, but his father had
hunted the red deer in Somerset for sev
eral years in the early part of his life.
A celebrated artist tells a story of bow,
when he was playing with pencil and
paper, he suddenly be^an to draw a por
trait of a face that he seemed to remem
ber. But he never discovered the original
until when, on a visit to a country house,
he discovered the face among the por
traits of the ancestors of the lamily. On
inquiry he found that nis grandfather had
once been engaged to be married to the
girl, but tied been obliged to give her up
on the pressure of her relatives. Of n dif
ferent kind is the story told of the late Dr.
ButcLer of Dublin, the eminent surgeon.
His fellow students used to say that when
he commenced work in the dissecting
room he seemed to show a memory of
similnr processes used by an ancestor.â

WAITING FOR IT TO EXPLOED.
How Lord Rosse AatonUhed an
Kngineer.
Hon. Charles Algernon Parsons, who
has just come before the public as the
inventor of a new marine motor, which is
destined to revolutionize steam naviga
tion (the motor being an adaptation of
the turbine system, and having attained
the enormous speed of thirty-four miles an
hour for the first-class torpedo-boat to
which it has bean fitted), is the younger
brother of that extremely clever peer, the
Earl of Rosse. Indeed, it would be diffi
cult to find a more useful trio of citizens
than these three Parsons brothers, who
nre descended in a direct line from one of
the principal stntesmen of the reign of
Queen El'zabetli.
Their father was celebrated throughout
the civilized world as one of the leading
astronomers of the day and his name wi!l
ever ba identified with tbe wonderful tele
scope he erected on his estate at Parsons
town in Ireland. Richard, the second of
the brothers, Is a partner of Sir James
KitÂ«on in his famous engineering works
at Leeds, while Charles is likewise con
nected with a great engineering firm in
the north of England, which has sufficient
confidence in his new invention to have
embarked a considerable amount of
money therein.
As for the Earl himself he is a practical
eneineer ot such skill that on one occasion
when going over a manufactory the
manager, who was ignorant of the identity
of his visitor, drew him asido and offered
him the position of engineer of the estab
lishment, explaining that he was just the
kind of intelligent workman that the firm
required. It must be explained that Lord
Rosse is very careless about his dress.
On another occasion, having entered the
engine-room of a large manufactory, the
engineer' attention was attracted by his
odd behavior.
"Well, what's up now?" he prowled nt
the peer. "What arc you shaking your
head and pulling out your watch for?
What have you got to tind fault with, any
how?"
"Oh," replied Lord Rosse, "it is all tbe
same to me. I have got no fault to find.
1 am just waiting till the boiler explodes."
"The boiler explodes? Why, you are
crazy, man," exclaimed the engineer,
angrily, preparing to turn the peer out as
a dangerous crank.
"Well," retorted the Earl, "if yon
work ten minutes longer with that loose
screw there the boiler certainly will ex
plode."
The engineer, gazing in the direction
indirated by Lord Rosse, paled and
jumped to stop the eneine.
"Why the devil didn't you say so
sooner? 1 ' he blurted out.
"Why should I?" answered the peer.
"I never yet have had an opportunity of
seeing a boiler explode." â Pittsburg Dis

Two Mean Men of Kentucky.
Parson Itichey is very popular as a
matrimonial mechanic, and is frequently
called on for his services. One day a
pretty hard-favored fellow came to him on

a mission of this kind, and when he 1 ad
told hi 3 business asked what the fee
would be. "1 do not make any regular
charge," said the parson. "Pay me what
ever you like." "No, I want you to say,"
said his customer. "On, well," said the
parson, pleasantly, "just pay me accord
ing to the kind of girl you're getting."
Tne fellow leered toward the parson, and,
with an odious expression on his counte
nance, said in a confidential tone, "Well,
I'll teil you, Mr. Ricfcey, she ain't much."
Parson Richey did not earn any fee in
that case, for he refused to tie a helpless
woman to a scoundrel like that.
Almost as mean was the fellow who
went into a saloon and called for a half
pint of whisky, at the same time laying
down a dollar. When he got the bottle in
his hands he asked, "What's it worth?'
"Twenty-five cents,'' was the answer.
"Ain't you got Â«ny 15-cent whisky?"
"Yes," said the b irkseper, "but it isn't
good." "It'll do, " said the mean man;

SIR WALTER AND THE POTATO.
Historic Myrtle Grove and Its Literary
Associations.
Even in this prosaic end of the nine
teenth century, when it is difficult to
arouse much enthusiasm over celebrations
and anniversaries', says London Sketch, a
good deal of attention was attracted to an
announcement made some -months ago
that tne tercentenary of the potato was
about to be celebrated in Ireland, a country
in whose history, particularly during the
last century, this well-known esculent has
played no inconsiderable part.
The idea, which originated with the
Irish Gardeners' Association, was ad
mirably carried out in Dublin last week,
when an exhibition of potatoes, with Â»
conference presided over by Visconnt
Powerscourt, was opened in the Ro
tunda, and attracted large crowds of
visitors, who were not slow to express
their amazement at the numerous and
magniticent specimens which science and
cultivation had developed from the origi
nal small, waxy, and, if history Bpeaks
truly, somewhat tasteless tuber which
Sir Walter iialeigli brougat from Amer
ica and caused to !> â  planted in the gar
dens of Myrtle Grove just 300 years
ago. Tradition says that his servants
gathered the apple off the plants, cooked
them and pronounced them a failure, and
only discovered the veritable pommes de
terre when tilling the ground later on;
| but apparently Sir Walter was better ac
quainted with the vegetable, as a quaint
old etching on the staircase at Myrtle
Grove represents him instructing two
Irish peasant women how to cook pota
toes, which was the Celtic pronunciation
i of the Spanish term batata, by which the
tuber was known in the New World.
En passant, it may be mentioned that
Myrtle Grove has other claims to recoe
nition. The house, the most perfect ex
ample of Elizbethan architecture extant
in Irelnnd, was erected by Sir Walter
about 1585, close to the town'of Youghal,
on some property that had been confisca
ted from the celebrated Earl of Desmond,
whom the English general defeated a
few years previously.
Here it was that Edmund Spenser
joined his friend, and in this peacefnl,
picturesque retreat wrote most cf his
masterpiece, "The Faery Queen," a first
copy of which is preserved in the drawing
room, where it lies, in company with one
of Sir Walter's literary efforts, on his old
carved table. Indeed, it is t :.e desire of
the present owner, Sir Henry Blake, Gov
ernor of Jamaica, to preserve as far as
possible the historic associations of the
house, in which he hopes to place an in
teresting collection of relics. Careful in
vestigation has discovered that the house
is lined with beautiful oatc paneling, which
for many years has been concealed ba
neath a coating of plaster and wallpaper,
evidently an effort on the part of some
Philistine inhabitants to bring the man
sion "up to date." Tobacco as well a3
potatoes found the soil and climate of the
County Cork congenial, and the big yew
tree still flourishes, under whose branches
Sir Walter used to sit and enjoy the frag
rant weed which he cultivated so success
fully.

TO SOLVE
THE WATER
QUESTION
Mayor Phelan Says Public
Ownership Alone Will
Do It.
AND CHAIRMAN CLINTON
CONCURS.
A Corps of Engineers to Be Ap
pointed 10 Figure the
Cost.
-WHAT FOOLS THE PEOPLE ARE,
1 ANYHOW."
The Water Rates Must Ec Deter
mined by th 24 h of the
Present Monti).
"The solution of this water question
must ultimately be in public ownership.
I think most people have agreed on that."
This was an expression of opinion by
Mayor Phelau that interrupted the dis
cussion of this same water question by the
committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday morning; and somewhat tooK by
surprise the officers of the Spring Valley
as well as other interested persons present.
"It is the intention of the board to em
ploy a competent expert to ascertain what
it would cost the City to supply itself
with water from other sources than those
of Spring Valley," added the Mayor.
The surprise was augmented by the
prompt manner in which Dr. Clinton,
chairman of the committee, took up the
idea and supplemented it.
As to the solution lying in public owner
ship he said there was no question at all,
and continuing: " ; It is the intention of the
committee, I believe, when we make our
final report, to ask that a competent
corps of engineers be employed to thor-
oughiy investigate the various water
source? of this State and the cost of bring
ing water here, nnd ;ilso to thoroughly in
vestigate the value of the Spring Valley
plant.
' -There is no question to my mind,"
continued the chairman, "but the Spring
Valley Water Works, from what I have
seen of them, are simply admirable and
their supply is abundant for probably
fifty years to come.
â¢'Wuen I stood at the dam at Alameda
and saw the millions of gallons of water
running to waste, and when I considered
how that company, with its usual fore
sight, got that property for a mere baga
telle, then I thought what fools the people
of San Francisco are. There was an op
portunity to buy a piant that would sup
p:v this City for fifty years to come ai a
nominal price.
"It is surprising that we stand idly by
nnd see one source alter another gobbled
up by the Soring Valley Water Company,
while no effort is made on the part of the
City itself to acquire them. The works
are constantly bt-coming more and more
valuable and if we concluded to buy
them to-day we would probably have to
pay 100 per cent more than wo would fif
teen or twenty years ago."
'You know," said Attorney Kellogg,
for the water company, "that Alameda
Creek was offered to the City first and it
refused to take it."
This little outburst occurred at the close
of the morning session of the committee
yesterday, at which, by the way, oulv Mr.
Britt nnd Dr. Clinton of the committee
and Mayor Phelan were present. The
Spring Valley was represented by Mr.
Schussler, Mr. Booker, chief bookkeeper,
Attorney Kellogg and other lesser officials.
Expert Williams 1 report was under dis
cussion. Mr. Williams was sworn and
said that sii.ee having filed the report, as
printed in yesterday's Call, he had no
occasion to change his mind concerning
any of the statements therein made; also
under direct questioning Dy Dr. Clinton
that he did not think the method of
bookkeeping employed by the company
could be improved upon. It mipht, he
said, be made to exhibit more detail, but
the labor and the number ol clerks that
would have to be added would make it
almost impracticable.
This disposed of the report. The inter
mittent fire of the committee over the
details of the water company's business
which has characterized the many sittings
heretofore was now resumea. In answer
to questions, Mr. Booker explained that
the numoer of iaucets in a house did not
affect the rates charged. Stationary wash
stands, bath tubs and suou, were the
things that counted. A tap outside of a
house where there was a garden, was rated
at 20 cents a month. Dr. Clinton made a
special pleading against this charge. H?
Amd that many iamilies having a small
plat of ground in front, would cultivate it
but for this expense. He thought the
company would be doing a very popular
thing to cut this charge. Mr. Scbussler
said that the charge was necessary, because
of the likelihood of abuse of this outside
water privilege. The small plat of ground
would not be the limit of its use, as most
people would sprinkle the pavement and
street.
The cost of meters coming under dis
discussion Mr. Booker said it would re
quire $300,000 to inaugurate the system
and another $100,000 annually to operate
it. The annual loss to the company by
delinquencies averaged about $108,000, or
over $9000 a month.
"Is it possible," asked Mr. Britt, "to fix
a rate that will assure you a proper an
nual income?'"
"Not unless yon collect the bills that we
can't," said Booker.
Mr. Phelan asked if the company had
suffered from the faithlessness of its em
ployes during the past year, to which Mr.
Booker answered that it had not.
Mr. Kellogg inquired of Schussler what
method of fixing tne rate might be adopted
if the City owned its own water works.
Mr. Schussler answered that the conrse
taken by Eastern cities would probably be
pursued. The City would raise tie inter
est ofi the bonded indebtedness by taxa
tion and the running expenses of the
works by water assessments.
It was here that Mayor Pbelan broke in
with his declaration as to the solution of
the question of pnblic ownership, ftone
of the officials of the company made any
comment. As tney were about to adjourn
Mr. Booker called the attention 01 the
committee to the necessity of a speedy
settlement of the rate, saying that it
would be necessary on his part to figure
out the application of every water-user
in the City on the new Dnsis wherever
changes were made and this would re
quire no little time. This declaration
came upon the committee with some sur
prise, it being their understanding that
they had until the Ist of June at least in
which to conclude their deliberation?.
Mr. Booker said be could not adjust him
selfâor the books and bills â to new con
ditions in the time that would allow be
tore July 1. The rate would have to be
fixed no"t later than the 20th of this
month.
The committee will accordingly try to
meet the requirement and the matter
will be determined at least by the regular
meeting of the bo;>rd on the 24th.
HEAVY TAX SUITS.
Bank* Demand > oney Paid Into the
City Treatnry Under Protest.
Complaint has been made by the Anglo-
Californian Bunk of this City that unjust
assessment was levied against it in 1896.
T:.e managers of the bank set forth in a
suit beeun by them against the City and
County of Ran Francisco yesterday that
last year an item of $782,707 was assessed
against there, which amount represented
loans on collateral security. The plaintiff
alleges that under the law loans secured
by stocks, bonds or warrants or other lien
on personal property are nut taxable, and
that such taxation as was attempted in
this case was prohibited by law.
The tÂ»x as levied was paid under pro
test, and the City is now callsd on to re
fund $10,943 SI, with leeal interest and
costs.
A similar suit has been begun against
the City and County of San Francisco by
the California Safe Deposit and Trust
Company for $6017 17.
Success in this litigation would mean a
serionÂ« impairment of the City's financial
resources, as similar suits against tbe City
aggregating over $500,000 are now pending
in the Superior Court.
MAGDALEN ASYLUM.
Judge Carroll Cook Declare* That It Is
the City's Industrial School.
jmlce Carroll Cook has handed down an
opinion in the case of Cecilia Gwinn, on
habeas corpus, denning and establishing
the legal status of the Magdalen Asylum
of this City as the successor to the Indus
trial School. By an examination of the
law Judge Cook finds that when the old
Industrial School was abolished in 1893
the bnperTisors selected the Magdalen
Asylum "as an industrial school for the
tieiention of all females whose detention
in tie Industrial School of the City and
County of San Francisco is authorized by
the laws of the State of California."
Adding to this, Judge Cook offers the
conclusion:
Cecilia Gwinn is such a female, and the
Board of Supervisors, having ihe same power
to provide a place 01 imprisonment that the
original board of managers of the Industrial
School Department nad, her imprisonment is
legal and justified by law.
Touching the alleged necessity of ob
taining the consent of the Mayor before
an inmate of the asylum could be dis
charged from custody, Judge Cook said
that provision of the law is void; that tbe
Mayor has nothing to say in the matter.
The power to release rests solely with the
Judge of the Police Court who signed the
commitment or with his successor.

day evening, after which he will be ready
to talk business with Gans or McKeever,
both of whom are at present in training
; for fights that will be "pulled off" in this
City.
Keever stated yesterday that in Phil
adelphia a referee cannot give a decision,
on account of the peculiar law they have
there which refers to boxing contests.
Public opinion and the press decide the
question of supremacy. McKeever has in
his possession, numerous clippings from
Eastern papers, which give him much the
better of the fistic argument he had in
Philadelphia with Lavigne.
One paper states that he bad Lavigne
on the ropes and was punching the "Kid"
at will at the finish of the final round.
However that may have been, Lavigne
will give McKeever a chance to prove to
the sporting fraternity of this City what
he can do to him in a : twenty-round con
test, provided some of the clubs will offer
championship inducements for a bout, of
this kind. Certainly a match between
Lavigne and McKeevi-r or Lavigne and
Gans â provided the last-named pugilist
can whip Leonard â would attract a large
gathering of sports if held under the
auspices of any one of the professional
clubs of this City.
The newly organized athletic club, cor
ner of Eizhth and Folsom streets, has an
nounced that Joe McAuliffe and Theo
dore Van Buskirk will be matched to fight
under its auspices some, evening in July.
The friends of Van Buskirk say that the j
Olympic heavy-weight has permanently
retired from the prize ring and it that be
the case the club should substitute Sam
Fruit, the colored gladiator, who made
such a remarkable stand against Arm
strong at the entertainment of the Na
tional Club, for Van Buskirk, Pruit and
McAuliffe would be a great card for a new
club.
Butler, the colored pugilist, who is
matched to fight Slavin on the evening of
the 31st is expected to arrive to-day.
The National Club has decided to hold
its entertainment on the 25th inst.

A Fatal Omelet.
Ignorance of cooking is not often the
direct cause of a man's death, observes
an exchange,- but such an instance la re
lated by Miss Edith Licbel in a recent
volume entitled, "The Btory of Two
Salons." In the time of the French revo
lution .one M. Condorcet, upon whose
head as an aristocrat a price was set,
sought refuge with a friend, M. Suard,
who bade turn return at nightfall, when
means of escape would be provided.
Unhappily Condorcet, being unable to
exist without tobacco, went into a tavern
to buy some. Still prostrate from fatigue,
he thought he would take advantage of
this opportunity to get some dinner, and
ordered an omelet.
"How many eggs do you wish to be
used?" inquired the landlord, who had
been eying him suspiciously. The inno
cent Condorcet was at his wits' end. Me
reflected on . the size of the ordinary
omelet.
"Twelve," he boldly replied.
His fate was sealed. None but an aris
tocrat conld be so ignorant or so extrava
gant. IHe was arrested and led away to
prison, from which he never emerged.

Nothing nnasual disturbed the calm,
cool, sweet serenity of the racing the last
day of the regular racing season at Emery
ville, unless it was the win of Sea Spray
in the concluding chapter at odds of 40
to 1. The gelding has been beaten nearly
all winter by "crabs," but he came out
yesterday and saddened the backers of
Montallade by winning in a hard drive,
sending the constituents of that horse
home full of emotion, but empty of
pocket. The ferry- boats carried hundreds
of people to the track and the sixteen
bookmakers must have thought a cyclone
had paid a visitation to the little town
across the water. Two, jusl two, favorites
won, but if one or two other well-backed
onen had been kept away far from the
odor of the deadly enibdming fluid, the
tale might have been a different one. Old
timers, though, are familiar with getaway
days, and no complaints were heard.
After a long retirement, Crescendo came
out in the opening hve and a half furlong
scramble, pitted against a field of cheap
ones, and was the most pronounced sort
of a favorite. Pocketed to the turn, he
was far from being the Crescendo of old,
and despite Marty Bergen's desperate
riding, was defeated a nose by the 12 to 1
outsider, Santuzza, with Clawson up.
Tom Kiley's nood Salvator colt, Salabar,
proved the* best of the seven two-year
olds which started in the six-furlong
scramble. Backed down to 2to 1 favorit
ism, he came on from fourth position in
tbe stretch, and Bergen landed him win
ner, over a length in front of Eismore,
with Torsida finishing in the show. Els
more was disqualified for fouling the lat

Owner Mat Storn put Piggott up on
Horatio, and he proved a big improve

had piloted the chestnut colt. He was an

NOTES.
Mike Hennessy will gain no fresh laurels
in the East unless he changes his riding
tactics. He was gniity yesterday of as
dirty a piece of riding as has been seen on
either of the big tricks in many moons.
With the leg up on Elsmore, when he saw
that his mount' was beaten, he deliberately
pulled in toward the mil, spoiling the
chances of Torsida and nearly putting
that filly over the fence. He was fined
$100 for the trie* and got off light. A fine
of $50 was also imposed on Mike for mis
behavior at the post.
"Dageie" Smith, owner of Torsida, was
so incensed at Hennessy's tactics that he
threatened to wnip the rider and was fined
$50 for abusive language. The fine should
be remitted.
IMPOBTATION OP MONKEYS.
The Demand Moil ly Confined to Show
People and Organ-Grinders.
There are imported into this country
5000 or 6000 monkeys annually, which
come chiefly from Africa and India, by way
of Europe. Natives eaten the monkeys
and carry them down to the shipping
ports, where they sell them to sailors
aboard ship, or more likely to captains of
vessels, or to agents of European dealers
in animals.
Sometimes on shipboard a rope is tied
around a monkey aud it is perinitled
within a limited space to roam tne deck.
Usually, however, monkeys are shipped
in slatted boxes. Some monkeys are
brought direct to this port, but by far the
gteater number go to the animal-dealers
in Europe, where monkeys imported here
are bought.
Occasionally a small monkey is sold for
a pet, out the number now sold for that
purpose is very limited. There is still
some demand for monkeys to be carried
by organ-grinders. Though the monkey
has disappeared from the city, it is still
carried to some extent by organ-grinders
in the country. But the great demand
for monkeys conies from show people.
The monkey is peculiarly sensitive to
draughts and to changes of temperature,
to which it is often subject with the circus
menagerie.
The average life of a monkey under such
circumstances is about a year. The me
nagerie practically renews its slock of
monkeys annually. Under favorable con
ditions indoor monkeys live in captivity
for, it may be, twelve or fifteen years.
Monkeys rarely breed in captivity.
One importer in birds and animals in
this city carries in summer a stock of
about 200 monkeys; in winter usually
about fifty. Single monlceys sell at about
$15 each; in lots of riftv or" more good as
sorted monkeys of different species and
sizes are worth about $12 apiece.â Naw

Reading a Library to Write One Novel.
The amount of labor that goes to the
making of a good historical novel is rather
deterrent to the writer of fiction who is
used to turning out regularly two novels a
year. It is so much easier to make over
again with a little imagination, the char
acters and incidents that one has
picked up in th" ordinary course of
life and travel. Thackeray somewhere
tells of the tremendous amount of reading
that went into the caldron before
"Esmond" was brewed. And a little
while ago an aged librarian related bis
surprise at the research the great novelist
carried on, month after month, in his
accumulation of historical details. A
whole chapter could be written in tha
time devoted to the verifying a detail of
costume or the turn of an antique phrase.
Moreover, the historical novelist realizes
that he is taking this tremendous amount
ot pains for a very lew people; that hardly
one in a thousand of his leaders care* for
more than the skill with which he tells
his story. But that one is the man who
will tell the next generation, with author
ity, that the book is worth preserving. â

BROKEN RIBS
OF LA BERGE
The Grand Jury Will Hear
His Version of Hospi
tal Treatment.
Dr. Dv Puy Says Any Physician
of Skill Should Have Found
the Fracture.
How the Wife of the Patient Was L?d
to Sign a Statement to Screen
the Hospital Doctors.
Charles H. La Berg*, who asserts that
he was roughly treated and roundly
abused at the City and County Hospital
on the 7th inst., will bring hia case to the
attention of t: c Grand Jury.
La Berge's statements in some respects
are contradicted by the hospital authori
ties, but the evidence is conclusive that
some one at the hospital blundered.
Dr. Dv Puy of the Richmond district,
who attended the patient after the Utter
was removed from the hospital, was inter
viewed yesterday. The doctor said:
"When the patient was brought to me I
saw on examination that two of his ribs
were broken. He was bandaged loosely,
and I sought to put a plaster jacket on
him, but be was so prostrated by weak
ness and pain that he could not stand
erect. So I made him as easy as possible
with the bandages, and after he had had a
night's rest I put on the plaster jacket.
The patient was suffering intensely with
every breath he drew."
In reply to questions Dr. Dv Puy said:
"Any physician of ordinary skill should
have discovered tne fracture."
La Berge, who was present when the
interview took place, admitted that he
did kick and make a noise at the hospital,
but it was because he was suffering great
pain and could get no one to attend to his
case. H. Giannini, interne, said to him:
"If you don't stop your noise I will throw
you out. You are here on charity any
how and probably robbing some poor
doctor on the outside."
Continuing his statement La Berge
said: "I resented the charge that 1 was
there on charity and reminded the interne
that the hospital was supported by tax
payers."
In yesterday's Call there was published
a statement over the signature of Mrs. C.
H. La Berge. T is statement sets forth
that she removed her husband against the
wislie ; and advice of the medical and sur
gical staff of hospital physicians, and did
so of her own free will and accord. La
Ber^e makes the following explanation of
the manner in wbicn the signature to this
statement was procured:
"i was on my feet ready to leave the
hospital with my wife. She was detained
to be told that she must sign a paper to
get out of the gate. Sue began to read the
document and I protested against the de
lay, suffering great pain at the time.
One of the attendants said to her: 'Never
mind about reading it; sign it.' And she
si&ne 1.
"Why the statement mad* by the hos
pital authorities in to-day's Call that the
only injury 1 had received was a s ight
contusion on the right side is ab urd.
The fact is I was not bruised at all on the
right si.Je. i lie broken ribs are on the
left side. I did not know that I was
examined by Dr. Puillp Thomas until I
read Dr. Giannini's version of the exam
ination in to-day's Call.
"I snail not let the matter rest here, but
will take the case to tne Grand Jury. I
know how I was treated at the City and
County Hospital and I am tod that un
fortunate feliows who are taken to the
City Keceiving Hospital also get a dose of
brutality. Here is a letter which I re
ceived to-day:
San Francisco, May 14, 1897.
C. H. La Berge, SUI Fijth avenueâ Dear Sib: I
saw a nonce in this morning's Call ot your
uuforiunute fall And a partial expose of the in
human and unkind treatment and actual
abuse from the men who pretend^to treat and
care for the unfortunate who are* taken to our
Keceiving Hospital, and I am glad you feel de
termined to expose in a measure at least tbose
inhuman wretches.
I am speaking from a knowledge and ex
perience of my own, for I am sorry to say I
have recently been there, and wMie I would
comfort and console you in your affliction, if I
could, yet my special object in writing you ai
this time is to let you know that if you wane
any other Incidents of ill-treatment, more
evidence of their impudent and inhuman
conduct in your efforts to expose them, you
can gel it fresh, live and without fear or favor
by calling on or writing to the undersigned.
I work at the carpenter business, and have
been in this City nearly fifteen years. On
Saturday, May 1, 1 was putting up a little
porch over a door for one of my customers,
and when turning from the porch to a laoder
it gave way and let me fall some eleven feet,
striking square on my back. Well, as I could
not get up or walk, the ambulance was called,
and 1 wanted thi/m to take me home, but no,
I roust be taken to the Receiving Hoipital and
be examined. I did not know men that it was
a slaughter-house or a robbers' den, and I
consented, and to the hospital they took me.
If it wilt be of any interest or benefit to you
to know further particulars i will gladly give
them, if by so doing we can better Inform the
people who pay freely to sustain the hospital,
what they may expect if any of them are ever
so unfortunate as to have to be taken there.
1 am now somewhat better and able to walk
around a little. With best wishes for your re
covery. 1 am, respectfully yours,

BUCKNER'S SURRENDER.
The Story as Told by General Wallace,
to Whom thÂ« Surrender Wai Made.
About 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Qeneral Buckner knocked at the door of
General Wallace's room in the Denison.
Upou the response, "Come in," the Ken
tuckian walked in, and in a moment the
two generals, who are connected in his
tory with the affair at Donelson some
years ago, were warmly shaking bands.
After those present had been introduced
to the Kentuckian, who has yet the bear
ing of a soldier. General Wallace asked
him to a eat and a cigar.
"Permit me to light my pipe," >aid
General Buckner, as he presented to sight
a cob with a long, crooked stem.
"Shall I introduce you as Governor or
general?" asked Wallace.
"As Sim Buckner," was the quick re
sponse.
Alter the two had talked for a few min
utes they walked into the rotunda of the
hotel arm in arm and became the center
of a group.
"I first knew General Buckner two
years oefore the war," said General Wal
lace. "We had a military encampment in
Crawfordsville. and among the companies
invited was that in Kentucky command
ed by General Buckner. The invitation
was accepted and when General BucKner
arrived I put the camp under his com
mand. Subsequently I was the guest of
General Buckner's company at a two
weeks encampment in Louisville, when I
made the acquaintance ot two score of the
Hower of the young men of Kentucky.
At Donelson Buckner was the heroic figure
on the Confederate side. There were
two generals who outranked him
who, if they had taken his
advice, would have cut their way out of
Donelson before all of Giant's lorce had
come up and got into position. When
surrender was the only thing that could
be done, Floyd, who had been a member
of Buchanan's Cabinet, said to Pillow,
the next in command, 'I turn the com
mand over to you.' General Pillow, in
turn, said to General Buckner. 'I turn the
command over to you.' The soldierly
Buckner replied: 'Very well; I am con
tent to share the fortunes or tiiese men
who are to be surrendered.' Already
terms bad been asked of General Grant,
and his famous response to the
request was 'unconditional surren
der.' I had orders to assault the
Confederate lines at break of day, and
was forming my division for that purpose
when an officer rode out toward us with a
flag of truce. General Fred Kaefler, who
was my adjutant-general, escorted the
officer to me, and tie informed me that
General Buckner desired to surrender.
Taking Colonel Jim Ross, one of my staff,
I rode inside the works with the officer of
General Buckner. Turoueh tne lines of
men with stacsed arms we rode to Gen
eral Buckner's headquarters in the little
villape tavern. The general wns at break
fast, but upon my being announced he
sent one of his siaff to invite me
inside. .With that courtesy which is so
natural to him he came forward and
offered his hand and, turning to his staff,
said: General Wallace, you know these
gentlemen.' It was true, for they were
among tbe officers I had met and become
acquainted with when I wa< their guest
at the Kentucky encampment. With
true Kentucky hosui tan ty Buckner asked:
'Have you breakfasted? 1 I replied that I
had not. 'Sit down and have breakfast,'
be continued, as room was made for me at
his side. Breakfast must have been a
light affair with Genera: Buckuer and bis
staff that morning. 'Tom,' said Buckner,
addressing his servant, 'What have you
got to eat ?'
" 'Not much, general,' said Tom, with
a bow.
" Have you any meat?' said the general.
" 'None,' said Tom.
"Have you any bread ?'
â "A little corn cake,' was the reply.
" 'Any coffee?'
'"1 will' see,' said Tom, as he disap
peared.
"In a few moments Tom appeared with
some corn biead and a coffeepot. The
coffee had been watered to transparency.
'Wallace, do you take sugar and cream in
your coffee?'
" 'Never m tbe morning,' I answered.
" 'It is well, for we have not even sugar,'
was the Keniuckian's reply.
'We conversed while 1 ate the very
frugal breakfast. The surrender followed
on General Grant's terms; but we all ad
mired the chivalry of General Buckner,
whicn was displayed in his remaining
with the army and sharing in its for
tunes in the surrender wben he might
have escaped, as did tiis superior officers.
General Grant had known General Buck
ner in the old army and they were fast
friends. By the special invitation of Gen
eral Grant General Buckner visited him a
short time before his death and was one
of hts pallbearers. I am vejy proud to
have enjoyed his personal" friendship
nearly forty years."â lndianapolis Jour

A Campaign of Education.
A gentleman who is usually a home
keeping man, but who was induced to en- |
ter the race for a minor office early in tbe j
campaign, was "giving his experience"
outside of meeting the other day, says the
Atlanta Constitution. He said: "N->, I
shall never run for office again, not if I
know it. For three weeks after I took the
stump I did riot see my family, and dur
ing my absence at that time a fellow who
was shipping watermelons for me pock
eted the returns for four carloads and
skipped the country; tramp rode away on
one of ray best hordes; my wife invested
$200 in bicycles; my youngest daughter
ran away ana married a fellow for me to
support, and all of our mutual relatives
came to congratulate mv wife on the
honor which bad been conferred upon me
and incidentally to spend the summer.
Those three weeks cost me in round num
bers $400. to say nothing of the son-in-law,
who threatens to be permanent, and the
office for which I was striving is worth
just $(JOO a year. I won't be elected, how
ever, and I'm glad of it. But this has
been a campaign of education to me, for
in it i have learned just how much of a
fool I really was."

j^^ MB for the Recovery of This Vital
r<Kj * Wr Power.
rTHE FIRST INDICATION OF A WASTING VITAL FORCE, THE FIRST
evidence of a weakness may mean the total collapse of all mental vigor in a few
years. It is dangerous to treat this symptom with indifference, to suppose that it
means nothing. â â ' It means a great deal. It is the forewarning of complete exhaus-
j tion that is coming. It tells of the result of past follies, excesses and overexertion of
mental and physical powers. It means that you are beginning to fail, and swift is
the course of destruction once started. Like the serpent's warning, it should urga
prompt action. Effective means of checking the waste and restoring the power lost
can be found in electricity. Vital force, animal magnetism, is infused into the fail-
ing nerves and organs from DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT. There are thou-
sands of vigorous men to-day who owe their recovery solely to Dr. Sanden's Belt.
It gives steady, soothing currents of electricity into the weak parts, reviving the
vital powers and restoring a healthy and vigorous manhood.
Don't you think you are missing the best part of your life by living it in misery
through the want of that which makes life a pleasure? . ~X : 1.7.--
-"I have worn your Electric Belt two months now, and I can say I am a better man and
stronger than 1 ever was. I feel no weakness in my back and my eyes are clear. You are at
liberty to refer any one to me. It will be a great pleasure for me to write to others and tell
them what Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt has done for me." Thus writes L. Walker, Beckwlth,
Cal., April 25, 1897.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt offers you new, fresh proof of its cures. There are
no claims of cures made five or ten years ago, but to-day. Every day brings new
ones, and right at your door.
Would you believe it if your closest friend confided to you his cure by a certain
remedy? It is a modern remedy, up to date, and cures when the old ideas fail.
Simple? As simple as two and two. .It is electricity. "Electricity is life."
It is nerve force. By excesses or errors you waste nerve force, and Dr. Sanden's
Belt renews it
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
Is effective even after all known drugs have failed to do good.
"I got your Belt several months ago for lame back, kidney and Monarch trouble. Iwu
all broken up and miserable. My digestion was so bad that I was in agony after eating. Now,
after applying your Belt, I have been getting gradually better, and am happy to say. that I
consider myself entirely cared." says S. Fossuin, 62 Sierra street, Potrero, San Francisco,
May 1, 1897.
Even electricity is useless if not intelligently applied. Dr. Sanden has devoted
twenty years to close study of the nerve and other forces, and even if other belts fall
his treatment will cure.
Cheap, clumsily made electric belts are like cheap jewelry. You think you are
getting a high-class article at a low price, but your experience tells you that you pay
for twice what you get.
Don't hesitate to write to Dr. Sanden because at a distance. Two days from
the time you write will bring you an answer with full information concerning his
wonderful Belts. Hundreds of people in California have discarded all other treat-
ment arid are now using Dr. Sanden's Electric Belts with pleasing results.

The Member of the Board of Health
Has Two Broken Teeth at d
Lacerated Lips-
Dr. John M. Williamson of the Board of
Health was painfully though not seriously
injured in a bicycle accident yesterday
morning. The doctor is an ardent ( yclist,
and often takes advantage oi the fine
mornings to spin awheel through Golden
Gate Park in company with some friend.
Yesterday he had as a companion Dr.
Bnnnell of the Receiving Hospital.
The two medicos were following thÂ«
cycle path that skirts the speed drive at a
moderate pace, Dr. Bunnell being in the
lead. Just as they reached one of the
sharpest turns in the path they hÂ«ard a
shout, and looking up saw a tandem
ridden by two young men coming at ft
fast clip and right upon them.
There was no time to follow the rules of
the road, and Dr. Bunnell promptly
headed his wheel into the bushes and just
in time, for the tandem wtmked past hit
rear wheel like a shot as he tore his way
through the undergrowth. Dr. William
son was not so fortunate, for he was not
able to get out of the narrow trail in time,
and as he turnea to the right there was a
head-end collision that wrecked both
wheels and more or Jeas injured all three
men. The doctor was thrown violently on

ing his lips and bruising his left nip.
The tandem-riders escaped with slight
bruises, but tneir wheel looked like aheap
of scrap-iron and wooden splinters. Dr.
Williamson, disregarding his own iu
iuries, went at once to those who had
caused the accident to look after them in
a professional way if necessary, but found
that his fears were groundless.
Dr. Bunnell had. in the meantime, rid
den to the part ambulance station and
sent the relief vehicle to the scene of the
accident to render assistance if needed,
but Dr. Williamson declared that he wag
all right beyond a sore moutn and hip,
and be went home aa soon as possible.
It will require the services of a dentist
to manufacture new teeth to take tbe
places of the broken ones, but otherwise
he will not be greatly troubled by his in
juries.
The most remarkable part of the pro
ceeding was tbe perfect manner in which
the doctor held bis temper. He did not
even berate the careless young fellows
who caustd the accident, and seemed to
feel more anxious about their welfare than
his own.
"Fortunate it was no worse," he said.
At a quiet-looking farm near Somer

KANGAROO LAND
Explained by Mr. Eindle,
Ex- Member of Par
liament.
Only Forty Cents on the Hun
dred Dollars Is the Levy
on Land.
Ail the Public Utilities Owned by
the Government and Yield a
Big Rsvenu:.
Among the visitors in this City during
the past week from toreign countries was
John Kindle, a prominent merchant of
Sydney, New South Wales, and an ex
uiemberof Parliament. Mr. Hindle left
Sydney on his first voyage to the United
btates March 15 last and arrived here
twehtv-five days later. After spending a
few days in this metropolis he went south
to visit iriends in Los Angeles, and also
to take a look at the southern country.
Returning to this City a few days ago he
spent the rest of his time with friends
here, and sailed for home on the Mono
wai, which left this port last Thursday
night.
Mr. Hindle wa? a member of the New
South Wales Parliament from 1891 to 1594,
Laving been elected as a representative of
labor and business interests in Sydney,
and especially as a champion of tax re
iorm. He is a clean-cut and uncompro
mising single-iaxerâ one who i 3 domi
nated by the idea that industry should
never be taxed or In any way burdened by
legal restrictions, ana that all public rev
enue should be drawn from land values
alone. Shortly before sailing for home
Mr. Hindie was asked by a Call reporter
as to his impressions of this country and
the conditions in his own. On the first
proposition he said:
"I like California exceedingly, or at
least what 1 have seen of it. You cer
tainly have here a natural garden-spot,
capable of unlimited development, and
isan Francisco is in many respects a mag
nificent city. But I find here, to my sur
prise, industrial conditions that are de
plorable. With all your vast natural re-^
sources tnere are thousands and tena of
thousands of people out of employment
and unable to get it; in fact, many are
subsisting on charity, with no prospect of
any change for the better.
"Ye: I should not feel surprised at this,
since I know that your land and ail
natural lesources expressed in the word
land are monopolized by a few creedy
corporations and individuals, so that labor
cannot apply itself to the passive factor in
vealth production without the consent of
the earth lords and then only on such
terms as the lords of the soil may dictate.
i found the same conditions in and
around Los Angeles as those that exist
Hereabouts. In fact your whole State,
trrand and resourceful as it is, naturally
rests under the dark shadow of land
monopoly, and that, in my opinion, is
what ails your people."
"How about Australia?"
"Well, Australia has suffered and is yet
suffering from this same evil of landlord
ism. In New Soutd AY ales, however, we
have taken a step toward reform on these
lines, and the good effects of it are already
felt. UntiL about a year ago we had im
posed no government tax on land, but
depended ertirely on other sources ior
the necessary public revenue.
â¢ Our bources of revenue are twofold â
direct taxation and public service. It
should oe borne in mind that the govern
ments of the Australian colonies own and
control a'i railways, tramways, postal
and telegraph line^, water ana sewerage
systems, and such other public works as
harbors, roads and bridges. The Austra
lian governments are the greatest em
ployers of labor on earth. They do
not employ labor, however, as a mat
ter of charity to those who need to
work, but'becauss a vast amount of labor
is required in the construction and main
tenance of such public utilities as I have
named. Taxatijn on foreign importations
yields, in round numbers, $55, 000,000 rer
annum. No country in the world is so
lightly taxed as Australia. Our revenue
in New South Wales from public services
is very targeâ about $105 000.000 per an
num. This, of course, cannot be called
taxation in the usual sense of the :erm, as
it is payment by me people to the Gov
ernment for services rendered.
"The people of Australia believe in Gov
ernment control of all natural monop
olies. Private control of them would not
be tolerated in our country.
"Public opinion is also rapidly crys
tallizing upon the idea that Governments
should not sell the remaining public
land?, but that they should be disposed
of by the leasehold system, or in other
words, brought practically under the
sincie-tax system,
"We do not tax personal property or im
provements; but we have a mild form of
land tax, only 1 penny to the pound,
which is equal to 2 cents on $5 in United
Mates money. This land nine tax went
into effect a year ago, and much benefit
has already developed as a result. Even
with so light a tax on land values, the own
ers of idie lands find it unprofitable to hold
tnem out ot use, and are therefore either
abandoning them to be improved by oth
ers, or riming them up into smallhold
ings and selling them at reduced prices lo
those who will put them to their best
uses. No doubt. New South Wales will
increase ttus l;snd tax until we have
reached a point wuere no land privately
owned, either in city or country, will be
heid idle.
"Our tariff faxes are very light and
likely to grow smaller by degrees and
beautifully less. Aside from liqnorf.opium
and tobacco only seven or eight kinas of
imported products are subject to aiuies.
To Australians visiting the United States
the policy of taxing personal property, as
you do here, peems so strangely inconsis
tent and unjust that we can hardly relieve
it is done.
"If a public official in our country
should undertake to go around into peo
ple's houses and. places of business and
ask them what wa3 the value of their
goods or furniiure, how much money they
had in bank, bow much jewelry, how
many musical instruments or other per
t-onal property they owned, or what were
the gross receipts on their business, such
nvi impertinent intermeddier in private
affain would be looked upon as a lunatic
freshly escaped from some a-ylnra.
'â¢We do not believe that the Govern
ment has any right to poke us nose into
people's private business, nor has It a
right to take from them under the name
of taxation any portion of their personal
earnings. Tins sentiment is growing
stronger all the ;time as the subject of ta^
aion anci revenue continues to be agi
tated."
'Are the industrial conditions in New
Â£ouih Wales perceptibly better now than
thrv were a year or two yearo aco?"
"Ye?, they are decidedly better and
â fonstantly improving. Legitimate busi
ness of all kinds is more active, money
circulates more treeiy, collections ore
easier, wages are higner and there are
tew if any involuntary idle workers.
Those who do not find satisfac ory em
ployment in the cities can have recourse
to the land, since the grip of ihe landlord
i-as, been slightly loosened. This tax on
land values 13 producing good results, not
only directly but indirectly.
"The feeiinc among owners of large
tracts and valuable ground in the cities is
that the penny-a-pound tax means a great
deal more than that. They regard it as an
entering wedge destined to split the
monopoly log. They leadily foresee that
as the first st a p toward raising public rev
enue from land values has been taken,
it will inevitably be followed by
other and longer strides until the single
tax system iv its entirety is reached.
Hence their eagerness to either relinquish
or improve their real estate holdings.
Thus it will appear that the single tax in
our country is producing good results in
advance of its coming."
"Are the single-taxers in your country
â¢numerous? '
"They are very numerous, though com
paratively few who believe in the prin
ciple are known as single- taxers. Thou
sends are such without really knowing it
themselves. Ti.e idea is in their heads
and it dominates their actions. So that
no matter what they call themselves or
think they are they are practically with
us, and the reform "goes on with irresist
ible force toward the goal of complete in
dustrial freedom.
"As I before said I am pleased with and
deeply interested in California. It is a
country of matchless resources and almost
unlimited possibilities. I intend to visit
this country again next year."

Just am the Shark WaÂ« About to Grab
Him a Sword fish Got the Miaik.
: 'Speaking of wonderful adventures,"
said the retired sea captain, "I doubt if
anything ever was more wonderful than
the one I'm going to tell you. It hap
pened a good many years ago, but that
doesn't alter its excellence nor interfere
with Us truth. I was first mate on the
Lovely Lou of Bangor, and we had been
on our way to South America for about.
four weeks. The wnd had left ths ship
during the last day of this period, and we
were dipping our peak to a loliing swell
that seemed to come from nowhere and
return to the s-ime place without making
a ripple on the blue surface of the ocean.
"The sails were all set and their shadows
fell clear upon the glassy surface, but
where the sun fell the water was as clear I
as crystal. We were well within the tropics
then, and several big sharks had been seen
playing about the vessel. Suddenly there
came a splash, and the cook ran to where
I was standing on the poop deck, crying
that one of the sailors had tumbled over- |
board. Th<Â» Lou had no way. ana I laughed
at the idea of him drowning, telling the
cook to throw him a rope, walking to the
rail as I did so. The sailor was swimming j
about the quarter enjoying his bath when |
I suddenly saw an ominous black tin make
its appeaiance a hundrpd yards or so from j
the ship. I yelled for the rope, and as I j
yelled I saw the fin move toward the
sailor, cutting the water like a knife. I
knew that unless the man was taken out
quickly he would oe devoured, and rushed :
to the cabin grating to get a line.
"Seizing a piece of rope I hastened to the
rail just in time to see the form of an im- >
men.se shark turn on its side tc seize the
sailor. As he did so there was an in
stant's glimpse of along brown body and
then the water was slashed into a sea of
yeasty foam, the shark seemingly being in
trouble. I threw the line and in a mo
ment the sailor was aboard, scared out of
his wits, but safe and sound. The thrash
ing in the water still continuing we pro
ceed to investigate, and directly we were I
able to see that the shark was pinned oy a ,
large swordfish, the sword running
through the jaws of the shark in sucn a I
manner as to prevent the fish from open- â¢
ing them. Whether the shark's antago- j
nist had deliberately attacked him we |
know not, but its timely and unexpected j
appearance saved the sailor's lite beyond |
adouot, as another instant would have
sent the teeth into the body of the man.
We managed to release the sword from
the shark and killed the latter, letting the
other go free. It was a narrow squeak, I
tell you." â New Orleans Times-Democrat.
HE GOT HIS ANSWEE.
But It "Was Wry Different From What
â  He Expected.
As the train pulled out of Chicago a
quiet, gentlemanly looking man entered
the buffet-car and, ensconcing himself in
a comfortable chair, drew out a long cigar
and entered deeply into his paper.
He remained so quiet and retained his
seat so long that another passenger, whose
bearing distinctly stamped him as a com
mercial traveling man, one of the kind
full of chatter and curiosity, could no
longer restrain himself. Addressins tha
quiet gentleman, he inquired, "Traveling
East?"
Slowly removing his cigar the gentle
man turned anil looked at his questioner
with slightly elevated eyebrows, replying,
** Ye s **
"New York?"
"Yes."
"Pleasure?"
"Yes and no."
''Great place, New York. Ever been 'â 
there before?"
"No.
"I'm going home this tripâ New York,
you know." -
The gentleman made no reply, but re
sumed his paper. After a little silence the
commercial man began again.
"I'm with C. & Co. on Broadway. If I
you drop in I'll show you over the city." J
"Thank you.it will not be necessary."
"Excuse me, but might I ask what
you're going to New YorK for?'
By this time most of the other passen
gers were interested. The gentleman, who
was extremely annoyed at the drummer's
curiosity, laid down his paper and ex
cia>med: â 
"I am going to New York first because
the train is taking me there; second, be
cause I've got lots of money and can
afford it; and last, because if I like the
place I intend to buy it.
The commercial man subsided amidst
a roar of laughter. â Philadelphia Times.;
A GIGANTIC WALL,

mere figures give only a poor idea of tho

it is, were laid down flat upon theglound,
it would cover nearly two acres, or half an
average city block. Three miantry regi

football match could be playeu upon it
without being badly cramped. Naturally
a wall of such size used up a fair amount

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY lti, 1897.
THE ADVANCEMENT Of
MEDICAL SCIENCE
Important Discoveries Made by
an Eminent Local
Physician.
A Medicine That Has Permanently
Cured Many Severe Cases Beyond
the Skill of Physicians.
During the past decade the advance
made in the practice of medicine and the
art of surgery have been equally as phe
nomenal as the wonders that have been
revealed to mankind in the electrical
world.
The ethins of the medical profession,
however, forbid as much as possible the
publicity of the discoveries of physicians
and surgeons, and it has been probably
more for this reason than any other that
we know so little of many of the phe
nomena that have been accomplished by
some o: our eminent specialists of recent
years.
In the treatment of indigestion and
dyspepsia it has always been agreed that
the fieid oF possible discoveries is broader
and possesses more profit to the physician
who would devote his knowledge and
energies in the discovery of some per
manent cure. '
It would seera that this end has at last
been accomplished. This revolution of
medicine, fraught with so much of hope
and blessing to poor humanity, has been
discovered by the work of a local physician
who has resided in California for the last
twenty years, but so modest and so unas
suming havn been hiÂ« ministrations
among an army of the afflicted, to whom
he has brought health and happiness
tnat our community little knows that Dr.
W. H. Bluett of 1069 Broadway, Oakland,
and with offices in thi* City, is the suc
cessful discoverer of a medicine, the
greatest, so it is said by his many pa
tients, of anything that has been given to
mankind 'or the cure of indigestion and
dyspepsia.
The new discovery is in the form of a
powder and administered three times a
day. it is not of the old regime of nause
ous medicine, but, on the contrary, might
be termed pleasant to the taste.
It is one of those more rational treat
ments evolved from nature's arsenal, and
comes as a ray of light piercing the gloom
and meeting wiih instant and widespread
success.
The doctor was seen at his offices at 6
O'Farrell street, in this City, and asked to
show some of the testimonials from prom
inent people recommending his wonder
ful medicine, about which so much has
been said.
"That 1 cannot permit," he said. "The
letters of patients are inviolate, and can
only be shown with the consent of the
writers. However, here are the names of
a few prominent professional and business
men whom you may interview."
Among those who stood willing to testi
fy to the wonders of this great mn.iicine
was Luther Fillmore, ex-Superintendent
of thÂ« Narrow-gauge Railroad; Hon. L.
R. Ellert; W. W. Hoops, a prominent
local roal estate operator; W. T. Hamil
ton, a retired merchant of Oakland, and
Hiss Et el Cox, cashier of the Emporium.
These are a few, and only a few, of the
score that live to testify to health and
happiness restored by a simple little
powder.
<; Yes," said Mr. Fillmore, "Dr. Bluett's
medicine restored me to health, and cer
tainly prolonged my life, after I had been
laid up for many years and spent a small
sized fortune doctoring with the leading
physicians in quest of relief from what I
thought a hopeless case of dyspepsia, in
dippstion and rheumatic gout.
'â¢You may say for me, young man, that
it is the most wonderful thing ever dis
covered for these troubles. It has not
alone brought me relief, bat hundreds of
others, friends of mine, whom I have
recommended it to during the past few
ve*r3."
A prominent ex-Mayor of this City
spoke in terms equally as positive of the
competency of Dr. Bluett in the handling
of dyspepsia, indigestion and chronic dis
eases, and dwelt at some length upon the
ereat good accomplished in his household
by the services of this eminent physician
and the administration of his wonderful
discovery.
"It is not my custom," continued this
gentleman, "to lend my voice and recom
mendation to anything. lam decidedly
opposed to that, but I consider that Dr.
Bluett and the good He has done for us,
where other physicians have failed, to be
a wonderfnl man in bi3 profession and I
cheerfnlly indorse him as leading, in my
estimation, among the scientists of medi
cine of modern times."
W. T. Hamilton of 807 J street, Sacra
mento, was treated and cured, and said he
had recommended over 100 cases that had
been treated and cured.
It is a remarkable fact that Dr. Bluett
diagnoses a case without astting a ques
tion, and it is conceded that in this regard
he stands without a peer.
This medicine is now being ordered and
shipped to all part? of America at $2 per
box or three boxes for $5 when sent by
mail or by express C. O. D. *

tomologists have p!aced the ladybug under a
different head from the ordinary bust, and in
the entomological sense it is known as "lady

with any breaking out on $he skin; even
though it be a single red spot, do not apply to
it so simple a thing as water, not or cold, but
let it alone and omit a meal or two; if it does

at hand, then live on half allowance until it
disappears." That was the advice given by a
medical journal to which was submitted the
question. "What is a good remedy for

Fbuit in California â Subscriber, City. The
counties in California that produce the largest
crops of (ruit are Santa Clara, Tulare, Sacra

San Bernardino and Riverside. Those in
which the greatest varieties are raised are:
Los Angeles, Santa Clara. San Dijgo, Santa
Barbara, Orange, Riverside and San Bernar

The question, "When are the different fruits
picked in California?" would involve mention
of every fruit produced, and this department

Protectionâ N. M., City. If an alien be
comes a citizen of the United States and car
ries out the promise he made unaer oath to ab
solutely renounce and abjure all allegiance to
every foreign prince, potentate, state or sov
ereignty, and particularly the prince, poten
tate, state or sovereignty of which he was be
fore a citizen or subject, he. is entitled to the
protection of the United States; but the mo
ment he goes from the country of his adopted
citizenship and enters the country of which
he was formerly a citizen or subject and en
ters its army in time of war that moment he
violates his oath and he is no longer entitled
to the protection of the United States. Tho
United States could not be held responsible lor
the acts of such men. "
Cable Railwayâ D. 8.. City. The present
system of drawing cars by an endless cable Is
not the result of the inventive genius of one
individual. In 1812 a stationary chain was
laid down upon a road in England by W. and
E. K. Chapman, which was made to pass over
a grooved wheel in a carriage specially adapted
for the purpose. By turning the wheel the
carriage was moved. This was the beginning
of the cable system. -Improvements followed
in England and in the United States, but to
Andrew S. Hallidie of San Fraucisco is due
the chief credit for the Invention of the pres
ent practicable cnble system. He took out his
firÂ«t patent in 1870 and on the Ist of August,
1873, made the first trial-trip on Clay street,
whicn was a decided success.
Navarreâ A. S., City. Navarre is the Span
ish province of an ancient country, created
into a kingdom in 858, which embraced some
territory on the French side of the Pyrenees,
now mainly forming the western portion of
the arrondissement of Maulcon. in the depart
ment Basse Pyrenees, and which attained its
greatest importauce toward the end of the
htieenth century, when the klnedora passed
into tne hHnds oi the Count of Foix, already
Viscount of Beam. In 1512 the kingdom was
seized by Ferdinand of Castile, but the portion
The Soft Glow of the Tea Rose
is acquired by ladies who use Pozzoki's
Complexion Powder. Try it-
on the French side remained in the possession
of the former King, who returned to Pau, the
capital of Beam, regaining the royal title. In
1512, when Ferdinand obtained possession of
the kingdom which now iorins the j.rosent
province of Navarre, he- annexed it to the
Spanish dominion, leaving unconquered tho
portion on the northern side of the Pyrenees,
which wÂ«is afterward united to the crown of
France by Henri of Navarre, who in June,
1572, became Kin^ of Navarre and was King
of France from 1589 to 1610.
Water Rightsâ A. S., Ferndale, Humboldt
County, Cal. The following on the subject of
water rights in California is taken from the
Clvii Code:
The right to the use of running water flowing in
a river or stream, or down a canyon or ravine,
may be acquired by appropriation. I; must r,e for
gome useful purpose, mid when the approprlÂ»tor
or his successor ceases to usa n for such purpose
the right ceases. â¢
â  The person entit'ed to the use of the water may
cha ge the place of diversion, if other* arc not in
jured by such change, and may extend the ditch,
flume, pipe or aqueduct by which the diversion
is made to a place beyond where the first use waj
made. â¢ ."â¢ '
The water appropriated' may be turned into the
channel of another stream and mingle with its
water and then reclaimed, but In reclaiming it
the water already appropriated by another must
not be diminished.
As between appropriators the one first In time is
the first in right. ..'",..
â  A person :H\-;rinL' to appropriate water must
post a notice in writing in a conspicuous place si
the point or the intended version, . stating
therein that he claims the water there flowing 10
the extent of (giving number) itichei, meas
ured with a four-foot pressure; the pur
pose for which he claims it, and
the place of intended use; . the means by
which he intends. to divert it and the size of the
flume, ditch, pipe or aqueduct in which he intends
to divert i.; a copy of the notice must within ten
days be recorded in the office of the County Re
corder in the county in which the notice is posted.
" Within sixty nays work must he commenced
and continued to completion without interruption,
unless prevented by snow or rain.
A failure to comply with the rules forfeits the
rig of the appropriator.
The Largest I. ami-Owner.
Probably Robert Reid, the railway con
tractor of Montreal, is the owner of mere
land than auy other private person in the
world. Is is estimated that he owns some
5000 square miles cf land in Newfound
land. Thi3 property was granted to him
in fee-simple by the Government in re
turq for Mr. Reid's operating the railway
that is fast approacninjÂ» completion, at
the rate of 5000 acres of land for eacn one
mile of main or branch line constructed
throughout the whole length of the pro
jected line.

A city official of Elizabeth, N.J., consulted a*phy*ician in the "country, where he
t was 'spending his vacation, about a chronic dyspepsia with which he had been a good ' J
deal troubled. It took the form of indigestion, the food not becoming readily as-
similated. After prescribing for some time, the physician finally told him he would
have to be treated for several months with a mild laxative and correctiveâ
. s - that would gradually brine back his normal condition without the violent action of -s
drastic remedies. A little later he sent to the Doctor a box of
Ripans Tabules
and wrote him what he understood the ingredients to be and the Doctor forthwith ' i
pronounced the formula a good one and just what was needed in the case.

MRS. DR. F. CLARK'S MAGIC BELT,

it destroys: It may guide you safely through
any perilous enterprise, may belp you to com-
plete your business transactions profl ably, in-
sures you against all loss, and thus assist you to
acquire wealth.
1l may be of a mesmeric characterâ drawing
others' I'ffdCtions toward you and thus securing

every mortal when in bitterness of spirit they

In the perron of Mrs. Nash remarkable
aud extraordinary gifts were (usily mani-
fested to herself in perplexing and as-
tounding ways. tliially recognizing the
power conferred upon her, her aim has been to
reiiue, deve op and uplif to that degree ot scien-
tific accuracy thai its benefits may devolve to
her fellow creature?. These wonderful and in-
scrutable Institutions brought into subjective
control are now at the service of the bumble or
the great without distinction or reservation.
Every individual la entitled to meet with the
success and happiness In life that their ai-i.ity.
ambitio , and courage demand, yet many are
struggling through life, fighting a losing battle
against the many aaveiaarie-i which tney are
forced to encounter through tin- unwise selec-
tion of api of ess on. traie or buslnesi for which
nature hits not fited them. Mr*. Nash reads the
life of her fellow creatures a> clenrly as an open
- scroll, pointing out the many faults and - difficul-
ties which hi. ye kept tliem from success, which,
in manr cases, can be remedied through their
own efforts.

RICHMOND NOW
MEANS BUSINESS
Will Hold a Mass-Meeting
for the Removal of the
City Cemetery.
A Number of Eminent Orators
Asked to Address the
People.
Increased Schoo Accommo'ations De<
manded in That S.ction of the
Citr.
The Richmond district of San Fran
cisco ia progressive. The people dwelling
there know what they want and manage
through force of well-directed agitation to
obtain recognition. They have three
schools, an engine-house, a branch of the
Free Public Library, station M of the
Postoffice, electric light and gas, fairly
good streets, ample streetcar facilities, the
best drainage system on the peninsula
and the lowest death rate in town.
One subject is uppermost in Richmond,
and that relates to the proposed removal
of the City ;Cemetery. Ab regards the
closing of Laurel Hill. Calvary, Masonio
and Odd Fellows' cemeteries there is a
division of sentiment.
Tlie Richmoud District Association is
not willing to let the subject rest, so far as
the city cemetery is concerned. Ef
forts are being made by the circu
lation of a petition to arouse the Western
Addition. 'Tne leading spirits of this agi
tation are President Hobbs and Secretary
Maioney of the Richmond Improvement
Club. They hope to awaken so much pub
lic interest in the matter that the Point
Lobos Improvement Ciub, a remarkably
strong and active organization of which.
Mr. Fletcher is president, will join hands
with the other club.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of tne Richmond District Improve
ment Association, held on Friday, it was
decided to hold a mass-meeting to advo
cate the removal of the City Cemetery
from the district, on Friday evening, May
21, at Simonds Hall, corner Fourth ave
nue and California street.
It wks reported that Mayor Phelan, ex-
Mayor Butro, William M. Bunker, Eugene
Deuprey, Dr. H. J. Bouguton, M.D. (ex-
Surgeon-General of the Siate of Oregon),
Hon. 8. M. Sbomidge ana other eminent
speakers had been invited to address the
meeting.
The following were chosen to act as vice
rresidents of tlie evening: A. frbarboro, J.
C. Jordan, Charles W. Sutro, Prentice
Smith. Dr. F. B. Petrie, Ai. V. Samuels, J.
C. Brickell, 8. M. Darbee, E. M. Van
Frank, T. J. Glynn, George T. Marsh and
J. T. Ma bey.
A general invitation was extended to all
in favor of the movement to attend.
Walter T. Lyon, th â¢ editor of the R:ch
mond Banner, is sure that the district
ought to nave increased scnool accommo
dations. The existing schools are now
crowded. Next month tlie Maria Kip
Orphanage will he occupied, ana that
ocenpancy will bring seventy additional
children of school age to the district. Tho
notion in Richmond is that there should
be constructed on the present Sutro scuool
site a brick edifice of ci 'ht rooms.
While ti.e light at Richmond is good,
as far as it goes, more hirht would be ac
ceptable, and the Supervisors msy be en
lightened on this point.
Tne rooms in tlie Ryer building on the
corner of Clement street and Fourth ave
nue are being put in shape for Branch
No. 4of the iree library. Tne rooms will
be ready for the book* by June 1.

How Contra Costa Will
Try to Create Public
Enthusiasm.
General Rally of All Interested
in loining Two Coun
ties.
Hoa. J. M. Stcwe Has Prepared a
Statement and P an to Raise
the Fund.
â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, May 15. l
- Contra Costa County is gome; to take
the initiative in arousing public enthusi
asm on behalf of the proposed tunnel
through the hills into Alameda County.
A committee of citizens is now arrang- j
ing for a grand demonstration next Satur- I
day at ttie Contra Costa end of the tunnel, j
There will ba a barbecue ana some speech- j
making and a general rally of those who i
favor ttie oroject to those counties, and a
very enthusiastic gathering is expecte J.
The committees ironi both counties, ap- !
pointed to boom tue project and look up
the route, will be present, as well as the
members of the Oakland Board of Trade, i
Merchants' Exchange, A'ameda and Con- i
tra Costa Supervisors and otfa?r influen- j
tial citizens.
Hon. J. M. Stowe of Walnut Creek, who I
has always been an earnest advocate of
the tunnel road, has secured estimates of
the cost of the proposed enterprie and
finds that a tunnel 1000 feet In length can
be excavated tor $28,000, to which it will j
be necessary to add $12,030 lor the ap- j
proaches on both sides of the hill.
This would make a total of $40.C00, of !
which Contra Costa County has expressed ;
itself as being willing to pay half.
- Mr. Stowe says this amount couM bÂ«* |
most easily rai;-ed by appropriating $5000
from the general fund of the county, leav
ing $15 000 to be raised by bonding the j
road district which will be directly i
. benefited. This would increase the taxa- \
tion of townships '2 and 3 but 33 cents i
on each $1000 worth of taxable property ',
for the next ten years. Tins would be a j
small outlay compared with the benefits ;
that would accrue by reason of added j
population and the consequent increase of !
taxable property that would follow the
opening of the new road.
As matters stand at present Alameda
County, which has done the greater part !
of the clamoring for the road during the !
past twenty year*, is now showing less \
anxiety to have it completed than Contra
Costa.
.The Supervisors are about equally j
divided as to whether to make an appro- \
priation for the work at the beginning of ;
the next fiscal year, which commences |
July 1, or to undertake half of the work ;
and* join with the Contra Costa Super- j
visors.
The merchants of Oakland are still ac- '<
lively advocating the proposition and are
not at all disheartened.

Tnere was s. very unusual scene at ttÂ»e
corner of Fourteenth and Broadway this
morning. Mrs. E. B. McCord of Fruit
vale Jiscovered her daughter riding in a
buegy with a young man named Ray
Torras.
Last Sunday evening Miss Dora Mc-
Cord, who is better known as Miss Bing
ham, told her mother that she was coing
to church. Sue left the house and within
an hour she was the legal wife of Ray Tor
ras. Nothing was said about the mar
riage, and it was not until the published
announcement of the marriage license
' reached Mrs. McCord that she knew what
' her daughter had done. The young lady
| went home after the marriage as usual,
1 but when the secret was out there was a
! lively fcceno at the AlcCord household.
The next day Mrs. McCord went to Jus-
I tice Lawrence and asked for a warrant
! charging Torras with kidnaping her
daughter, who after the discovery had
disappeared. All efforts to locate the
young couple were in vain until this
morning, when Mrs. McCord saw her
daughter and soii-iu-law riding along
Broadway in a buggy.
Constable Weldou, who was with Mrs.
; McCord, stopped the buggy and questioned
the young couple. Ue was soon satisfied
: the girl was over tbe age of 18 and also
that she had been legally married, and
consequently he advised the mother he
rculd do nothing in the premises. Mrs.
McCord attempted to pull young Mrs.
? Terras out of the busgy, but her husband
'.. prevented her and drove away as quickly
j as possible.
They could not be found during the rest
of the day, but caused it to be Known that
! they left to-night for some place where
\ they will not be troubled any more.
For several months it has been known
\ that cordial relations existed between the
! two young people, and Mrs. McCord was
{ very outspoken in her objections to Ray
j Torras not only to her daughter, but to
! her neighbors. The young iady, however,
had a mind of her own and refused to dis
courage Ray's attentions, and decided at
last to act on her own responsibility.
Chance at tbe Pardee Homestead.
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 15 âMrs. Emily
Pardee, widow of the late Dr. Pardee, left
the old homestead on Eleventh street to
day and Dr. G. C. Pardee took possession.
This was done in accordance with the
terms of the compromise by which the
will contest was dismissed.
Mrs. Par.ice took with her all the per
sonal property allotted to her by the
agreement and will spend a few weeks in
San Francisco.
"1 am very undecided about my future
plans," said she to-day. "I shall probably
spend the summer at various resorts and
come back to Oakland in tbe winter. I
will not keep house, for I have now no
one to keep house for." Dr. Paruee will
move into the house on the Ist of June.
Slipped Slickly Out of Jail.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 15.â R. C. Ray
mond, a burglar serving a sentence in the
City Prison, escaped this morning, but
was caught before he had scaled the prison
fence. He planned his escape very cun
ningly and took advantage of the door be
ing open while the Health Officer was ex
amining a hypo fiend to slip out, slam the
door behind Him and was free before any
one realized what had happened.
Prison-keeper Green went to a win
dow of the cell and fired a Â«hot Into
the air. This attracted the attention of
Fire Ch : ef Fair and Assistant Murdock,
who overhauled Raymond as he was seat
ing the fence and took him hack to jail.
Raymond said he was the only one in tlie
scheme and that he had no partners who
might be planning a general outbreak.

903 Broadway, May 15. i
Since the killing of John Knarston, a
prominent officer of t;ie Druids, at the
corner of Ma ket and Seventh streets,
nearly two years aeo, there has been a
general desire on the part of the public
that the gore block which makes, that
point highly dangerous, should be re
moved.
This afternoon an important meeting
was held at the deadly corner, for the pur
pose of considering the removal of the
building there located. There were pres
ent General Manager Kruttschnitl of the
Southern. Pacific, A. D. Wilder, W. D.
Curtis, supervising engineer, Superin
tendent Fraser, Mayor Thomas, Council
men PriDgls, Howe, Cuvellier and Hennc
berry.
The building, which has been the cause
â of several people losing their lives
t through not being able to see the train as
j it comes around the curve, is owned by a
: man named Machado, and stands so far
1 out that there are only a tew feet between
I its frontage and the track. ':".-,.-'"
Councilman Cuveliier showed that the
house could be removed, the cellar filled
in and the curb extended so that every
thing would be saie, and there would sail
be a little plot on which a little grass and
a few flowers could be planted. The re
moval would also enable the company to
make the tracks at that point much
straighten
" Mr. Kruttschnitt said that the removal
; of the building would not only stand to
1 the benefit of the city, but would at the
same time insure greater protection to
| life. The house is assessed for $2000 and
| the land for $1000.
A general consultation was held regard
| ing the advisability of doing away with
the building, and also regarding the sub
stitution oi electricity for steam, and the
conference concluded with an agreement
on the part of the railroad officials that
next Monday night they would submit
I to the City Council a proposition regard-
I ing the removal of the building. ,

A NARROW ESCAPE.
Chief Officer Lawless Taken for a
Burglar by His Wife, Who Draws
. V a Revolver on Him.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 15.â Chief Offi
cer Lawless of the steamer Australia, who
is a resident of this city, had a narrow
escape from bes.ig shot by his wife in
mistake for a burglar recently. He came
home unexpectedly late at night, h-.s
vessel haviug got into port in the after
noon, but was unable to rouse any
one by rinping the bell and concluded
that no one was in the house. Finally he
borrowed a iantern from a neighbor and
alter some search found a window that
was unlocked and so entered the house.
Going to his room, he found the door
locked, and, putting his shoulder to it,
burst it open. No sooner was he in the
room than he was confronted by his wife
with a drawn revolver, which she aimed
at his head and was at the point of tiring
at him. He at once shouted to her and
she recognized his voice in the n.ck of
time to prevent shooting. It seems that
Mrs. Lawless hart her niece with her, and
:hey heard Mr. Lawless prowling around
the house, but, nut expecting him home,
they thought it was a burglar, and when
he forced tiu. door open ant- made up her
mind it was time to do some shooting. Ii
was a narrow escape all round.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
yOB J3:uaÂ«iway, May 15.)
Secretary Milroy of the Oakland Race
track Association did not relish the fact
that a deputy constable created him a
walking receipt ior bail money which he
was required to put up in contempt pro
ceedings.
This little inconvenience is but one in
cident in aconfl ct which has broken out
between Constable Cronin of Oakland
Township and the racetrack offioers.
Two weeks ago Constabe Cronin ar
rested two men in the betting ring who
were lighting until they were covered with
blood. He waited for some time to see if
the track officers would utop the row, and
seeing that they did not he at once placed
, the men under arrest.
The knowledge that his action would
I maKe public tbe fact that there had been
trouble at the track caused the official to
do everything in their power to prevent
Cronin from exercising his authority, and
j loajil to the unpleasantness, a day or
two later it became n cessary for tlie Con
stable to serve a subpeisa on Mr. Milroy.
The secretary ignored it, ana was later
| arrested on a bench warrant. A few days
I ago Constable Cronin was attempting to
pass tbrou.ru the gate at the track as
usual, on account of his bein_ # au officer,
but he was informed that on no account
could he be permitted to go throueb. He
thereupon paid $1 and went in. The next
â  day th'.R experience was repeated. Yes
! terday Cronin had a warrant to serve on a
1 man that was in tbe track. He went to
thÂ» gate, was refused admission, even
after he had made known his business.
ana when Gatekeeper Detweiier forcibly
prevented him from entering Crcimnat
: once placed him under arrest for resisting
an officer and took him to the County
; Jeii.
"These people at tbe track," said Cronin
to-day, "have been trying for some time
ito run things to suit themselves. But
: they cannot do it so far as I am concerned.
j The District Attorney has advised me that
I I am acting legally in going in there to
serve processes of couit, and I will not be
interfered with by racetrack employes."
Tbe racetrack officials say that there
i was no trouble with Cronin until he was
1 refused the privilege of passing through
! the gales as a deadheaa, and that as soon
I as he was required to pay bis way he be
| gac to make trouoie.

LAST AND LEAST
OF THE PADRES
Arranging to Celebrate the
Centenary of His
Work.
Father Montaner Finds a Man
Who Saw Mission San
Jose Built
Friar Lamen Left a Record of tbe
Programme of a Hundred
Years Ago,
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 15. f
Rev. Thomas McNaboe, pastor of the
church at Mission San Jose, is preparing
for an elaborate observance of tUe centen
ary of the founding of the mission upon
Holy Trinity Sunday, June 11, 1797. The
ceremonies will take place upon Sunday,
June 13, 1897.
Tbe pastor of the church has for his as
sistant Father Jose Maria Montaner aud
the latter ha*, after great research, com
piled a history of the mission ui.d.'r the
title "History of the Cradle of tiie Civili
zation of Aianifda County by the Last
and Least of the Spanish Padres." The
work has uct yet been published, but will
probably be ready before the 13. v of June.
Father Montaner, while visiting an In
dian village near Pleusanton, discovered
Felipe Josj Antonio, wno makes the sur
prising claim that he was pr^s^nt at :he
ioundation of the Mission in 1797, ar.d not
only that, but Felipe also declares that he
was then of sufficient a^e to be at the!
hrad of a family. When questioned, he
gave an ineligible account of tlie cere
monies at the foundation, and after ex
amining the record of baptisms Father
Montaner is inclined to beiieve there is
some basis for the old man's claim.
Not a great deal of the original mission
building remains, but there is one pre
cious relic which has been saved, and
this is the records of the early mission.
It consists of four volumes, bound in
sheepskin, with the records of baptisms,
births, marriages, deaths and rhurch ex
penses, going clear back to 1797. These
old volumes are written in Spanish in a
beautiiul, ciear band. One of the volumes
conuins the first and best history of the
founding of tne mission. It falls the first
page ana translated reads as follows:
The Mission San Jose was founded at the ex
pense of the Catholic King of Spain, Charles
IVâ God save himâ and by the order of the
Marquis of Branciforte, Viceroy and General
Governor of N. fi. The San Jose Mission com
menced on Sunday, 11th of June, 1797, the
feast of the most Holy Trinity. I, the under
signed, president of these missions of New
Ciilifornia, placed by His Majesty under the
care of the Apostolic College of the Propa
ganda Fide of St. Fernando of Mexico, blessed
water, tne place and a big cross, and with
great veneration we hoisted it. Immediately
after wo sang the litanies and the saints, and
I celebrated the ho.'y sacrament of the mass
and preached to the army and to the native
Indians who were there, and we ended the
ceremony singing solemnly the "Te Deum."

A Gift Intended as a Com

Students Who Desired to
Remembsr Lieutenant
Wion
The Lieutenant Went Away ani the
Present. Buyers Got Their
Mon-y Back.
BERKELEY, Cxi., May 15.â A gold
mounted sword inscribed with the name
of Lieutenant Frank Long Winn, was re
turned to its maker to-day. The sword
was to have been presented to the man
whose name it bears by the officers of the
University Battalion, but the lieutenant
absented himself from the commence
ment exercises, at which the gift was to
have been made, and now the purchasers
have got their money back and the com
plimentary inscription telling of the good
qualities of the intended recipient of the
weapon will be melted away.
The officer- of the battalion decided
that it would be a most appropriate act on
their part to make some gift to the lieu-
tenant, as he was about to leave Berkeley
tor good. They raised money by sub
scription and bought a costly sword, in
tending to have an interesting little pre
sentation ceremony at the commencement
exercises. When the afternoon came they
were surprised to find that there was ao
lieutenant present. The exercises wore
on, and still the head of the military de
partment did not appear.
An investigation disclosed tbe fact that
he had said a last farewell to the campus
over which he has marched unwilling
cadets for four years. He had started for
England to be present at the Queen's jub
ilee.
T c disgruntled students abandoned
their gift idea. The maker of the sword
a.- reed to take it back and refund the pur
chase money ana to-day the handsome
present with its kindly sentiments written
in steel found its way bacic to the business

Prizes at St. Mary'a.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 15.â The stu

association. The annual banquet wiil

The Queen's coronation ring is never

DURRANT'S CASE
IN BUDD'S HANDS
The Governor Visits Chief
Lees and Hears
Others.
Attorney â¢ General Fitzgerald
Rests on His Last
Brief.
A Summary of the Fatal Thirteen
Links That Convicted the
Condemned Man.
Governor Budd visited Chief Lees yes
terday morning to inquire further con
cerning the evidenco against Theodore
Durrant. He and the Chief were closeted
for some time in a consultation, and the
Governor was particularly auxions to ex
amine the handwriting that appeared on
the newspaper in which Blanche Lamont's
riugs were wrapped when they were re
lumed to her aunt, Mrs. Noble. Shortly
after his consultation with Chief Lees the
Governor met some people interested in
Durrant.
Mrs. Isabella J. Hoffman Martin was
one of the callers upon Governor Bu-ld in
Chief of Police Lees' ortice, and made an
appeal for a reprieve for Theodore Dur
rant. She aske>i tlie Governor not to be
influenced by popular prejudice, and re
quested him to examine the testimony
for himself.
The Governor received from her a state
ment containing about 7000 words, written
in her own hand. He assured her that he
would carefully examine the record and
her appeal and that he would not pay any
attention to anything outside of the evi
dence in the case.
Mrs. Martin told a Call reporter after
ward that when Captain Lees learned of
the nature of her mission be became very
angry and said that she haa no right to
have an opinion or to interfere in the
sew TO-DAT.

case. She disagreed with him and when
she left the office the entente cordiale had
vanished.
After Mrs. Martin left Chief Lees she
had an interview with Attorney Deuprey
and toid him that the Chief had accused
the attorneys for the defense of garbling
the evidence in the case and making a
one-sided statement. Mrs. Martin then
became suspicious that Captain Lees'
documents were not quite official. Captain
Lees referred to alleged misquotations of
the evidence said to have made by Deu
prey. These charges were made by the
Attorney-General in his brief before the
Supreme Court.
During the argument of Attorney Deu
prey before the Governor Friday he de
voted much attention to the testimony of
Mrs. Vcgel, and commented severely upon
the fact that she could not remember that
there was a telegraph pole in front of her
house.
The Governor interrupted by askine
Deuprey how long he iiad lived in his
present house, and Deuprey replied, "Five
years." Then the Governor asKed him
how many steps there were leading up to
his house. Deuprey replied that there
were two flights of steps â ten on the lirst
flight and eleven on the second.
In anticipation of the Governor's visit
Chief Lees sent Detective Gibson yester
day morning to Deuprey's house to count
the steps, and Gibson reported that there
were three landings, with four steps on
the first, six on the second and fourteen
on the third. The Governor asked Chief
Lees if he would send a man to count the
steps, and the Chief handed liim Gibson's
report.
After reading it the Governor smiled
and said: "I knew Deuprey was making a
bluff, for it is not in the nature of the hu
man mind to remember such details. I
have lived in my present house in Stock
ton for twenty-live years, and during all
that time I have not had occasion to in
quiie the name of a certain street a block
away from the house, and if asked now
for the name Df the street I could not
tell. Coming down on the train last night
I told Deunrej that he had made a good
bluff, but was in the position of a man
who had been called."
Tne Governor received from the Chief a
written account of the life of the convict,
Rosenberg, from the arrival of the ship
Hospodar on November 5, 1895, tiil his ar
rest and conviction in San Jose for horso
stealing.
Chief Lees did not care to express an
opinion regarding the outcome of his con
ference with the Governor, preferring to
allow the Governor to speak for himself.
The State's legal representatives rely
absolutely upon the records of the court
as making a case that cannot be shattered.
They hold that the chain of circumstan
tial evidence against Durrant is complete
and that they have traced him from the
time he met Blanche Limont in front of
the Normal School on Powell street until
he came, pale and disheveled, from the
belfry where his victim lay.
In this chain of evidence strangely there
are thirteen cardinal links, all of which, it
is claimed, are corroborated by several wit
nesses and each of which is properly lined
to all the others. These points are set
forth in the Attorney-General's brief sub
stantialiv in the following order:
Firstâ Mrs. Mary Vogel of 919 Powell
street saw Durrant opposite the Normal
School about 2 o'clock on April 3. He
waited nervously for about forty
minute*, then joined two girls and tooic
the Marketbound Poweil-street car with
them. She thought he acted strangely
and, having heard of robberies, viewed
him with her opera-glasses.
Secondâ Miss Minnie Bell Edwards, a
Normal School student, swore that she
and Blanche Lamont were joined by de
fendant at the time and place sworn to
by Mrs. Vogel. Her evidence is corrobo
rated by that of two other students, Alice
Pleasant and Mary Lanigan, who saw
Darrant and Miss Lamont sitting together
on the dummy of a Powell-street car.
Third â Mrs. Elizabeth D. Crossett posi
tively swore that she saw defendant and a
tall young lady on a Valencia-street car
the afternoon of the girl's disappearance,
between 3:30 and 4 o'clock. They left, the
car at Tweniy-nrst street. Wituess knew
Durrant well.
Fourth â Attorney Martin Quinlan, who
knew Durrint well, swore tnat he saw
him going toward the church of the trag
edy with a tall girl between 4:10 and 4:20
en the a'ternoon of April 3.
Fifth â Mrs. Caroline Leake saw Durrant
and a tall t-irl enter the church between
4 .md 4:39 p m. She knew Durrant well,
at d noticed the couple closely, because
she was expecting her daughter to return
home. She saw them from an upper win
dow of 124 Bartlett street.
Sixth â Organist George King swore that
he arrived at tbe church about sp. m. on
April 3. After he had played a few min
utes Durrant appeared from the belfry,
wnere the girl's body was afterward found.
He was pale, "had his coat and hat off
and his hair was disheveled." He Â«aid
he had been fixing the gas- burner and had
been overcome with gas.
Seventh â Janitor Frank Sademan swore
that the gasburners were in good order.
Eighthâ Mrs. Durrant swore that her
son did not look being well and did not
eat very heartily.
Nin'.nâ Pawnbroker Adolph Oppenheim
of 405 DuDont street swore that Durrant
tried to pawn a ring with him. It was a
peculiar one, and was afterward identified
as Blanche Lamont's. He tried to pawn
it between April 4 and 10.
Tenth â Ciear-maker Phillips of San

JOYFUL ADOPTION PARTY.
Jadge CoflTey Kntnrtained Some Happy
Visitors From Tracy.
Judge Coffey's conrt proceedin gs had a
touch of romance yesterday by the intro
duction of some interesting visitors from
Tracy, San Joaquin County.
Mrs. Mary Lizsette Guy appearea for
the purpose of giving her consent to the
adoption of her infant child, Henrik An
drew, by Andrew Winter and his wife,
Kate.
An odd affidavit was filed by John R.
Guy, the presumptive father of the child,
a bright little fellow who made himself at
home in the courtroom aud manifested
the fact that he did not stand in awe of
the court or the bailiff. Mr. Guy ad
mitted that he was married to Mary L.
Guy on the 15!h of August. 1894, and that
on January 3, 1895, a male child was born
unto her; that said child is the one for
which letters of adoption have been ap
plied by Mr. and Mrs. Winter; that the
atiiant has been requested to give his con
sent to the proposed adoption and that he
hereby expresses a willingness to nnve
the adoption granted, but that he dis
claims parentage of the child, and for
that reason refuses to travel from hi 3
present residence at Tracy to the city of
San Francisco to sign any papers as the
father of F?id child.
Mr. and MrÂ«. Winter testified that they
have no children of their own and prom
ised to care for the little one as if he had
been born to there. Judge Coffey signed
the necessary document*, and the happy
party left the courtroom beaming with
smiles.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 16, 189 T.
AN ATHLETIC WAR
IS NOW RAGING
The Amateur Union Is Up
held by Its Represen
tatives Here.
Olympic Club Obj cts to the
Mandates of Eastern
Amateurs.
A Meeting Called to Organize a
California Athletic Asso
ciation-
Amateur athletic affairs are now in a
very much muddled state.
Some weeks ago, as this paper stated at
tiie time, the Olympic Club grew very
much disgusted at the treatment it re
ceived from the Pacific Athletic Associa
tion of the Amateur Union, and at a
meeting held in the club the directors
concluded to "break away" from thÂ« as
sociation and calx a meeting of all the
amateur clubs on the coast for the pur
pose of organizing a California Amateur
Association, which will be strictly ama
teur in every sense.
The board of governors of the P. A.
A. accepted the resignation of the Olym
pic Club, and shortly afterward other
clubs followed in the footsteps of the
Olympic and sent in their resignations.
On Friday evening the Pacific Athletic
Association held its annual meeting at
the Reliance Club in Oakland, and several
of the members represented took the
Olympic Club to task. Some of them
stated that the association would be puri
fied by the absence of the Olympic Club
and some of the other clubs which, al
though pretending to be amateur, were
doing all in their power to foster profes
sional contests.
The officers of the Olympic Club do not,
however, appear to De much exercised
over the statements made by some of the
leading members of the Pacific Athletic
Association. In fact, the president of the
Olympic smiled when he read the report
of Friday evening's meeting, rie said:
"Well, you know the board is composed
principally of boys, some of whom are
undoubtedly very zealous and assuredly
enthusiastic, but they have got much to
learn. I will allow that they mean right,
but the question that is of greatest im
portance is: Can the amateur athletes of
California govern themselves without the
'assistance' of the Amateur Athletic
Union?
"Now you see, we Californians are a
very long distance from headquarters, so
to speak, and if there should be any ques
tion of importance arise that cannot be
decided by the representatives of the
union on this coast, why we must wait
two wesks at least for an answer from
New York, ana on more than one occasion
answers to questions have been delayed
to suit the convenience of the secretary
of the union.
"But that is not our only grievance ; we
have many. Our boys object to the small
inducements that are offered for compe
titions in boxing, wrestling and in fact all
round athletic sports. I cannot see why
the union should restrict amateurs to a
$35 trophy. Now if a $100 trophy is given,
winch is small inducement enough to a
boxer or wrestler who trains hard several
weeks for a contest, 1 have no doubt that
a large entry would result.
"Our athletiic talent is made up of
young men who were not born with silver
spoons in their mouths, and consequently
we must give them some better induce
ments than are given to the young men of
the clubs of New York, who are, in great
est part, the sons of wealthy men.
"I contend that a man can be an ama
teur, it matters not whether he contests
for a $100 trophy or a $5 trophy.
"We can govern ourselves at home with
out having to send to New York for in
structions, and it is with that object in
view the Olympic Club has called a meet
ins of the respective clubs of this coast for
Friday evening, the 28th iust
"I think that California has material
with ability and intelligence among its
athletic institutions to handle its own af
fairs to the satislaction of all concerned
in amateur athletic sports. The money
we send East annually to the secretary of
the union can be used to much better ad
vantage at home. With few exceptions
the amateur athletes of this coast favor
our scheme."
SELECTED THIS CITY.
A. J. Giddingf, Western Agent of the
Nickel- Plate Line, Hag Established
His Headquarters Here.
Arthur J. Giddings, who has been ap
pointed Western agent of the Nickel-
Plate Fast Freight Line, has decided to
establish his headquarters in this City.
he has charge of all the territory west of
the Missouri River, including the Pacific
Coast, and he had the choice of locating in
Denver, Los Angeles, Portland or this
City.
Prior to his appointment as Western
agent of the line he occupied the position
of chief clert in the general office at Buf
falo, N. V., from the time the line began
doing business in 1884.
The Buffalo Courier, in a lone article on
his promotion, says: "It is no flattery to
say that no man occupying a like position
is held in hicher esteem nor regarded as a
more reliable expert than Mr. Giddings.
He has a thorough familiarity with every
feature and branch of the service, is
widely known and lias a capacity for de
tail relating to traffic matters that has
gained for him the enviable reputation of
without a superior. Those with whom he
has been associated so long will regret to
part with him, for he is one of the most
companionable of men, but ttiey will also
be gratified that his lone and faithful ser
vice has received substantial and well
merited reward."
Physically, Mr. Giddings Is a splendid
specimen of American manhood, tall and
broad-shouldered, and, like most big men,
is genial and piemant in his manner*. He
and Police SerÂ« nut Casaius Jt\ Wright
were bo> s togither, and had not seen each
other for sixteen years till a few days ago.
For lofringament of Patent.
James C. Brown yesterday brought suit in
the United States Circuit Court against the
Oakland, San Leandro and Haywards Klectrlc
Railway Company to recover $100,000 and
costs for damages for infringement of patent.
He alleges that on December 7, 1886, letters
patent for seventeen years were issued to him
J'or a new Improvement in the construction ot
electric cars and that the defendant is using
his device without authority.
Whisky Thieves.
Frank Dondcr and Andrew Mason, alias
Mark, were booked at the City Prison yester
day on a charge of petty larceny, second
offense. A few days ago they got J. Lane, a
driver for Shea, Hocquersz & Co., liquor mer
chants, to go Into a lodging-bouse on the pre
text of getting a trunk, and while he whs
away they stole two demijohns of whisky
from his wagon.
Extradition Denied.
Judare Carroll Cook yesterday dismissed the
proceedings which were begun to secure the
extrndition of Edward Johnson and John
Bl*ck, charged with robbing a jewelry-store
â  v Rossland, fi. C. Black and Johnson hare
been Indicted by the Grand Jury of this City
ana County for bringing stolen go^ds into
this State, and will be tried for tiiat offense.
THE CADET CORPS.
Exhibition Drill by the Young National
Guardainen of the Lowell High
Schoolâ A Good Showing.
Tne eleventh annual exhibition drill by
the High School Cadets of the Lowell
High School was given in the First Regi
ment armory, 25 Page street, last night,
in the presence of a large number of the
friends and relatives of the young Na
tional guardsmen.
The company, numbering fifty-two, not
including the officers, was drilled by Cap
tain Eiwards, tUe commander, first by
fours and then by platoons. Their move
ments were almost faultless and the
marching was such as to call forth many
words of praise from military olHcers who
were present.
Ihese movements were followed by the
bayonet exercise by a selected squad. The
commands were given rapidly and were
executed, with one exception, with a pre
cision that would have been creditable to
a like number of men who had had more
experience in the manual of arms than
have the cadet corps.
Then came guard mount, in which all
the movements were very creditably exe
cuted. One thing was notable, and that
was that the rifles wim which the cadets
drill were those used by the members of
the adult companies, and they were too
heavy for many of those who carried I hem,
and as one of the boys said after the drill,
"Those jjuns seem to weigh a ton after you
have toyed with them for an hour."
After the drill a string band furnished
music for dancing, which was kept up
until a late hour.
REMEMBERED THEIR DEAD.
The Native Daughters of the Golden
West Decorate the Graves of
Departed Sisters.
. The beautiful practice of decorating
once a year with flowers the graves of the
departed, which had its origin in France,
and was then taken up by the Southern
women during the war and subsequently
by the Grand Army of the Republic, has
been taken up by the Native Daughters of
the Golden West.
The 15th day of May of each year has
been set apart when parlors throughout
the State shall visit the resting places of
those who have been called away from
earth and place upon each evidences of
fraternal remembrance in the shape of
flowers.
This was done yesterday by the mem
bers of the local parlors, and in the
evening each parlor assembled in its re
spective headquarters and there held
special service. In each there was read
from the ritual, and in others in addition
there was singing of music appropriate to
the occasion.
Such service was held by Alta. Buena
Vista. La Estrella, Golden State, Orinda,
Oro Fino and Yosemite parlors. In the
first named parlor "Nearer, My God, to
Thee" was siing by Lillie Wilson, "Abide
With Me" was rendered by Miss Evans,
and "The Golden City" was sung by Mrs.
Kemp Van Ee.
DEATH WAS HIS HEALEB-
Marinas P.. Gudde, Failing to Keep Hit
Health, Commits Suicide.
Marinus B. Qudde, a chicken rancher,
70 years of age, committed suicide in his
home, Eleventh avenue and I street, yes
terday by drinking a solution of mor
phine, (.nude's suicide was prompted by
failing health, and for several months he
had been anxious to end his life. He tried
to hang himself a short time ago, but was
prevented. Undaunted, however, he
waited a more favorable opportunity,
which presented itself yesterday morning,
and he took immediate advantage of it.
Early in the aioming the suicide drove
to the business portion of the City to pur
chase a loud of chicken feed. On his way
home he had a prescription, largely com
posed ol morphine, tilled, under the pre
tense that he intended using the solution
for a chicKen remedy.
When he reached home he went to his
woodshed and as he remained longer than
usual his widow went to call him. As she
reached the door he raised the phial con
taining the solution to bis lips and drank
half its contents. Mrs. Guide, knowing
her husband had swallowed poison, as he
had often threatened to do, summoned
Dr. McLauchlan. The physician worked
on his patient for several hours, out with
out avail, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon
death took place. Tlie Coroner was noti
fied and the body was removed to the
Morgue.

POLITICS IN THE
PRESTON SCHOOL
E. Carl Bank, Superintend
ent, Removed for Par
tisan Reasons.
E. S. O'BrieD, a Democrat of
Merced, Appointed by the
Board of Trustees.
E. M. Preston, Founder of the School,
Says This Is the First Introduc
tion of Politics in the School.
The board of trustees of the Preston
School of Industry, at lone, held three
sessions yesterday at the Grand Hotel in
this City. In afternoon seciet session
they removed E. Carl Bank, a faithful su
perintendent, for purely political reasons.
Mr. Bank has been superintendent of the
school since it was opened, in 1893. In
his place was appointed E. S. O'Brien of
Merced. Mr. O'Brien is a Democrat and
wanted the place.
The trustees also removed Assistant Su
perintendent Wood, and appointed in his
place ex-Chief of Police Timothy Lees of
Sacramento, a Democrat in need of an
office.
The removals were accomplished by the
votes of Trustees L. J. Maddox of Mo
desto and Dr. F. D. Tyrrell of Sacra
mento. The latter was recently appointed
on the board to take the place of Fayette
.Mace of lone. His appointment made the
board Democratic. Ex-Senator E. M.
Preston, the founder of the institution,
voted against the displacement of the
capable and experienced officers, but the
majority was against him.
At the Grand Hotel last evening Mr.
Preston said: "This is the first time
that politics has entered into the man
agement of the school. A few days ago a
canvass was made of the employes at the
school, and it was found that as many
Democrats as Republicans were employed.
Yes, I supposa that other removal's or
resignations will follow. I regard it as
unfortunate for the school and for the
State. Ido not know that the newly ap
pointed superintendent has had any ex
perience in the management of reforma
tory institutions. I think that question
was not considered."
When asked if any charges of incapa
city or misconduct had been preferred
against E. Carl Bank, the removed super
intendent, Mr. Preston replied: "No
charges were preferred against him.
There was no discussion as to the merits
of his successor. The rote was simply
taten on the proposition to remove Mr.
Bank and appoint Mr. O'Brien."
From other sources it transpires that
an active fight against Superintendent
Bank was make by the secretary of the
board, M. R. Barnard.
The slate prepared yesterday morning
gave the superintendency to ex-Chief
Lees of Sacramento, and the place of as
sistant to ei- Sheriff O' Neil l of the same
city. Later in the day a change in the
programme was made, and O'Brien was
slated for the first place.
Governor Budd was in town during the
sessions of the board, bat did not exercise
his right to attend the meeting.
The morning session of tne trustees was
devoted to an inspection of plans submit
ted by, architects for the annex and two
cottages. Nine competitors appeared with
architectural plans, as follows: Cuthber'
son & Bank*, San Francisco; Percy &
Hamilton, San Francisco; Cunningham
Brotners, Oakland ; W. W. Oates. Stock
ton, and Havens it Toeplce, John M. Cur
tis and William Corlett of San Francisco,
and Kilpatrick & Goddaru of Los Angeles.
At the evening session of the board
plans were discussed. After acceptance
of plans by the trustees, the Governor and
Secretary of State and Treasurer must
give their approval.

SAW CELEBRITIES.
The writer of the Mowing sketch was a little girl when
Walt Whitman, Charlotte Cushman, Paul Akers, Stephen A.
Douglas, Artemus Ward, Fred Douglass, Anna Dickinson,
John Burroughs and /. T. Trowbridge were in their prime.
She met all of them and formed impressions of them through
childish eyes which still abide with her, and which she herein
sets to paper with a lingering, loving touch. Most of these
people were visitors to the home of her mother, Elizabeth
Akers Allen, who was not the least of the famous company.
In many respects I was a very fortunate
little gir!, for my lints were for t.e most
part cast in jleasant p aces, and my sur
roundings and associations were such that
in* picture gallery of niv mind is hung with
tortraits the contemplation of which is a
great delight to me. As my mother, Mrs.
Elizabeth Akers Allen, whose world-fam
ous "Kuck Me to Sleep, Mother," is perhaps
the Dest known though it is by no means
me best of her many beautiful poems, wa
- . eess'ully engaged in literary work from
early girlhood, the friends even of my in
fancy were all persons who were notable
in literary or artistic lines.
Of al! these the one whose memory is
the dearest is the gifted young sculptor
of whom all New England was and is so
justly proudâ Paul Akersâ whose "Dead
Pearl-Fisher" is a lasting monument to
his genius.
It was my privilege to live under the
same roof witn th 3 mo^t lovabie of men
for one brief year, and although every mo
ment of that year which he knew to be
his last on earth must have been to him
full of suffering, botn mental and physi
cal, my whole remembrance of him is full
oi sunshine.
He was always gentle and patient with
me, and his studio, from which I was
never shut out. w.is to me the happiest
spot in all my small wor.d.
My rirst experience of this world's stern
discipline was when that life so full of
prorate came to an end, and while the
wor.d of art mourned fur the artist whose
lofty genius was only beginning to be
widely known and appreciated, I wept for
the loving-hearted man who had made for
rue, "a little hindering thing," so much of
happiness.
One of my childish pranks caused him
not a little mortification, but brought me
only the mildest of warnings not 10 ''do
so again."
1 delighted in standing on a cricket be
hind his chair when be was leading and
combing his hair, and one day the fancy
struck me to braid it in a number of small
loose braids, tying the ends with various
bits of bright colored ribbons. I had just
completed this operation when Mr. Akers,
hitherto entirely absorbed in his book,
recollected that he was very nearly late
for an important engagement, and, catch
ing up hia hat, hurried away.
When he came home again tie brought
me tbÂ« pieces of ribbon carefully folded
in his pocket, but not a word of reproof,
though I afterward heard that he wore
hiÂ« singular coiffure, with its flaunting
adornments, all the way downtown and
into the presence of some Tery stately

buildings, which is going up in New Yerfc There are but two taller business structures than The Call building in the world, the two shown first in the above cut. No other newspaper home is nearly so talL
personages before he was made aware of
the eccentricity of his appearance.
It was during the i rat of this year that
I met with an adventure, the memory of
which even yet causes mÂ« to smile, for it
was my first and undoubtedly my last ap
pearance on the Freaidential "stump."
It was just before Lincoln's election,
and Douglas, Brecfcinridee and Bell were
also in the field as candidates. We were
lat the time stopping in the principal
hotel of Maine's capital city, and one day,
for what reason I did not know, the estab
lishment was filled to overflowing with a
sudden influx of strangers, and such was
the consequent noise and confusion that
the regular guests of the house were more
than a little inconvenienced and annoyed
thereby.
After luncheon my mother and several
other ladies decided to take a long drive
to get away from the temporary discom
fort and, of coarse, 1 was to accompany
them. I was ready In advance of the
j others. at;d while my mother was tying
her bonnet-strings I slipped away, desir
ous of entering the carriage first. Child
like, I always preferred the main stairway
to the retired "Ladies' entrance," and I
scampered straight to it as soon as I
escaped from under the maternal eye.
To my surprise, after I had descended a
few steps, I saw that the place below was
! simply packed with people, and that they
j were all apparently gazing with embar
rassing interest at my small self.
I soon realized, however, that it was a
short, heavily built mun who stood a little
below me, talking very loudly and earn
i estiy, who was the center of attraction
| and not myself; but as I knew nothing of
; politics or politicians I comprehended
nothing of what was going on.
I did comprehend though that I could
not make my way through that mass of
people, and I turned to go back when the
speaker caught sight of me.
In an instant I was raised on high in a
' pair of strong arms, and in full sight of
the assembled multitude was kissed sev
'< eral times in the most effusive and af
! fectionate manner, while roar after roar
of applause rose from the admiring crowd.
It was the "Little Giant," Stephen A.
| Dongias, himself who held me, althougn
! I was ignorant of the fact until after I had
I been captured by my rightful guardian
and sternly reproved for interrupting that
; gentleman in the midst cf one of his
I famous speeches. I think, however, that
i Mr. Douulas rather welcomed my advent

himself to bis audience in a very pleas
ant light.
During that same year I met many per
sons of distinction of whom I have most
pleasant memories, but from among them
all one face stands out clearlyâ that of
the young sculptor's firm friend and warm
admirer, Charlotte Cushraan.
I stood much in awe of her at first, for
she was a large, masterful woman, who
came and went with a great rustling of
skirt--, and she had a firm, decided way of
talking, and a sharp way of looking at
people, which was to a shy child such as I
was exceedingly discomposing.
She had a large, wide face, with a full
forehead and a prominent chin and a
small nose, and I privately thought her
very ugly until ahe swooped down on me
one day and lifting me to a aeat in her
capacious lap set herself to the easy task
of winning a share of my heart.
Older persona than I have felt and
yielded to the marvelous power of fascina
tion whicn Miss Cushman possessed, in
spite of her lack of beauty, and it goes
without saying that I quickly fell a vic
tim to her wiles, and thought her one of
the most wonderful of women ever after.
After the death of Mr. Akers I was for
some time domiciled with a lady resident
of Portland, Maine, whose acquaintance
with notable people was wide. In her
pleasant and hospitable home Artemus
Ward (Charles F. Brown) was a frequent
and welcome guest, and many a delight
ful romp did 1 have with him, although
he gravely assured me that he "didn't
like children," and that my claim on his
attention and consideration lay in the
fact that I was "the oldest person for my
age and the smallest person for my size"
that he ever met.
One thing about the humorist always
troubled me in tbo.se days, and that was
that his extremely long and thin nose
had a decided leaning to one side. When
he became aware of my absorbingâ but
carefully repressed â interest in the mat
ter, he told me several tales to account
for the idiosyncrasy of this prominent
feature of his pleasant thougn unhand
some face. As all these stories were strik
ingly dissimilar, however, and never by
any accident gave the same reason for
the departure of his nasal organ from the
path of rectitude, I derived little real sat
isfaction from his humorous and elaborate
exclamations.
In this house, also, I met many mem
bers of the once notable- "Hutchinson
Family," which even then had passed the
meridian of popularity, the "Tribe of
; Asa" being the only representatives in the
! concert field.
Abby Hutchinson (Mrs. Fatton) was a
pretty, soft-voiced woman with a cnarm
ing manner and a smile that won her
friends everywhere.
Asa, with his big beard and deep voice,
and "Mrs. Asa," his plump and sweet
temnered wife, were always pleasant to
me, and I greatly enjoyed playing with
the children, especially with "little Den
nett," who was very bright and winning,
though somewhat spoiled and childishly
domineering in nis ways.
I well remember my happiness when 1
was once allowed to go behind the scenes
with the "tribe" at one of their concerts,
and Jisten to th-ir singing from the dress
ing-room instead of sifting tamely and
prosaically in the andience. Indeed, J
was so excited and hanpy on this occasion
that I got in everybody's way and both
ered the singers to such an extent that I
was never allowed the privilege a second
time, but that once was enough to make
me a heroine in the eyes of my little play
mates for weeks.
Here in Portland I first saw J. T. Trow
bridge, who because of the pen name Paul
Creyton, under which he began his fortu
nate literary career, was known to his
especial friends as "Paul." Mr. Trow
bridge seemed to me a grave, quiet sort of
a man, and I regarded him from a dis
tance with silent admiration.
On one occasion 1 did summon up cour
age enoueh to tell him that I had read his
"Martin Merrivale" and liked it very
much, and I was overwhelmed with bash
ful joy when he courteously thanked me
for my nood opinion and expressed the
hope that he would, before he died, write
many books far more worthy of my praise.
Fred Douglass was also a visitor to this
hospitable mansion, but although he,
being extremely fond of children, tried to
make a pet of me, 1 was always shy of
him. His dark, strongly marked face and
bushy, "kinicy" hair made me a trifle
afraid of him, and I avoided him as much
as posside at all times.
I was, however, consumed by a burning
curiosity as to the manner in which he
managed to keep his luxuriant, but to me
most unpleasing, chevelure in order,
since I was quite positive that no comb
could by any possibility penetrate us
woolly depths; and 1 covered myself with
disgrace and the household with con
fusion by asking him about the matter
one time when he had conquered my
prejudices and timidity sulticiently to
persuade me to sit upon his kn c for a few
moments.
Karl Formes, the famous basso, I met
during this same nappy time, and his
wonderful voice and leonine personality
made a singularly deep impression upon
me. 1 well remember how at the close
of one of his concerts, which I had been
allowed to attend under the escort of a
maid, I managed to slip away from the
long-suffering young woman and find my
way to the singer's dressing-room, where,
quivering and speechless, quite choked by
overwhelming emotions, I was welcomed
by him with truly fatherly kindness.
His artistic soul comprehended the tu
mult in my childisn breast and its cause,
and he did not torture me with question
or comment He simply took me up in i
his strong arms and soothed and com- !
forted me, as only one of his deep and
tender nature could do, and then restored
me to my much-perturbf d guardian, mak
ing me supremely happy by a kiss at
parting.
Years after, shortly before bis death, I
met the grand old singer in San Fran
cisco and recalled to his mind the little
incident, thus earning for myself an in
stant and glad recognition and welcome,
which form one of my happiest memories. !
Anna Dickinson, also, I saw in this j
same New England city when she was a i
very attractive, dark-haired, self-reliant
young woman with an earnest manner I
and "sometning to say," which she said
well. She was extremely popular in those
days, and her wonderful personal magnet
ism cave her a command over her audi
ences which was something almost in
credible to those who were never brought
under the influence of her peculiar gift.
She seemed to taKe an especial fancy to
me, and was greatly pleased with my
avowed determination tv "be a lecturer,
too," when 1 grew up.
In after years I saw her during her ill
advised and brief theatrical career, but
the fascination which was hers as a lec
turer was almost entirely lacking in her
as an actress, and the failure that she
made in the histrionic line, though pain
ful to herself and her many friends, was
not at all surprising.
While I was still in my short dresses
the power? that governed my young life
transported me to our National capital,
where I saw many of the foremost mili
tary heroes and politicians of the time.
Havinc been a "bookish" child from
babyhood, and reared in an essentially
bookish atmosphere, I was, however, far
more interested in literary celebrities.
Among the notable persons with whom
I was on terms of delightful friendship
were John Burroughs, the eminent
ornithologist and writer, and his unusual
ly pretty young wife, and John James
Piatt, the poet, and his "twin soul," Mrs.
S. M. B. Piatt, whose tender, fanciful and
always charming poems are ao weli
known.
Here, too, I saw Jane Grey Swisshelm, a
woman of considerable note in those days.
She was a somewhat eccentric person,
with a rather small head and a prom
inent nose, a nervous, unreposeful nature
and a two-edged tongue, which made her
feared by such of her associates as fell â a
frequent occurrence â under thÂ« ban of her
displeasure.
In Washington I also saw "Fanny
Fern" (Mrs. James Parton), whom I had
learned to love through reading her
"Fern Leaves," in which her warm
mother heart spoke a welcome to all
children. I was a little disappointed at
first sight of her, for I had imagined her
to be as lovely in person as she was in
disposition, and her face was undeniably
plain. She had, however, extremely beau
tiiul hair, full of the prettiest crinkles
and ripples imaginable, and her manner
was most charming â ingenuous, unaf
fected and amiable â and her lova for
children was a predominant trait in a
most truly sweet and womanly nature.
Of ali whom I knew and admiied in the
Capital City, however, the one who at
tracted me the most strongly and whose
memory is by me the most warmly cher
ished was Walt Whitman â "the good gray
poet'' â whom, with his strong, dominant
ways, his flowing hair and beard, his
eccentric garb, bis sonorous voice and his
wonderful powers of conversation, I
almost worshiped.
The genuineness of the man â his out
spoken hatred of all manner of cant and
hypocrisy and shamâ the broadness of his
views and the spirit of truth that was in
him and looked forth from his earnest,
keen, yet kindly eyes and spcke by means
of his sturdily brave and honest tongue,
all impressed me forcibly, although I was
too young to realize then where his
wonderful attraction lay.
He used to put his large hand on my
slender shoulder and look at me, gravely
smiling, as he aÃked me questions about
my reading and my studies, my likes and
dislikes, and possessed himself of my
-â¢mail opinions concerning weighty mat
ters. He must have found much amuse
ment in my answers, but he never laughed
at me openly, as he was too true and
noble a man to be careless of the feelings
of a child.
Indeed, through all his long and wor
thily spent life, "the good gray poet"
was always tenderly considerate of those
who were in any way weaker than
himself, and though he might, and
did, ride rough-shod over prejudices,
theories and beliefs which did not accord
with his own, he was always broadly
generous to the mistaken soul who advo
cated them.

CONSTRUCTION OF
TALL BUILDINGS
Many articles have been written about the appearance
and the composition of tall buildings, but it is not recalled that
any hitherto have been written to describe how the construct
ing was done. Many of us have gazed in awe at one of the
lofty structures rising away into the sky, and have vaguely
wondered how so marvelous a thing could have been gotten
together and raised so high. It is the purpose of this article
to set forth clearly how, and not why or where or when, these
tall buildings are made, to which novel extent it may interest.
"With the cheapening in the coat of steel
the limitations ol the architect disap
peared and the practicability of the erec
tion of a structure of twenty or more
stones was established. Really, however,
the difficult part of the work is done in
the offices of the architect or engineer.
The calculations and details are intricate
to the last degree. All contingencies have
to be provided for before a spade of earth
is removed.
The stability and strength of the build
ing depend entirely upon the foundation.
In New York the difficulty of securing an
absolutely safe foundation has been very
great. The Manhattan building rests on a
foundation carried fifty-seven feet below
the surface, and the Washington seventy
five feet. The task of sinking them down
to the solid rock was extremely difficult.
In some instances as much time was spent
below ground as in the prosecution of all
the work that was done above.
In San Francisco no difficulty has ever
attended the laying of foundations for
any of our high buildings. In the lower
portions of the City the sandy formation
abounds to a great depth and the archi
tect asks for nothing better upon which
to erect the most massive structure.
Take the lofty structure that has gone
upon Market and Third streets during
the past year. First came the excavation,
winch was made twenty-live feet below
the pavement and extended twenty-rive
feet beyond the outside walls. Upon the
floor of this great cavern concrete to the
depth of two feet was spread. Upon this
bed of concrete steel beams were laid
eighteen inches apart and concrete packed
in between. This soon became solid and
hard as rock. Thirty iron columns, girded
together so as to form practically one
from top to bottom support the surer
structure. The base of each column rests
upon ca<-tiron bedplates, which, in turn,
are supported by steel beams laid at righ;
angles to each other and built up in con
crete, as is the rest of the foundation.
The columns weigh about twenty tons
eacb, and are handled easily by the steam
derricks, controlled by experienced rig
gers. .
The foundations completed, the work on
the superstruc'ure rapidly proceeded. The
beams and uprights of each floor were
connected by *teel braces, ail riveted to
gether, the riveters working in connection
with the riegers and frame-setters as story
succeeded story.
A travel it.;; crane facilitated the work,
and the nandling of the steel beams was
comparatively easy. At each corner of
the building a derrick, controlled by steam
' engines, drew the steel frames from below
and passed them to the crane above, to be
set in their proper places.
Perhaps half a dozen floors of the build
ing were comuleted by the frame-setters
before the brick and stone masons began
their work. When these workmen reached
the fourth or fifth floor the pipelayeis and
plumters began getting the large steam,
sewer and water pipes in place, and fol
lowing after them came the mason setting
the fireproof partitions between the
rooms, and subsequently appeared the
electricians, who siring the wires for the
telephones from story to story, tiie con
duits of which are sunk into the partitions
and covered with concrete, so as to be in
visible.
In this massive building there are over
three miles of gas, water, vent, waste and
steam pipes, and fully twenty miles of
electric wires.
Before nil the subordinate tradesmen
began their work the painter appeared.
The chief enemy to the high building,
and the source of all subiequent danger,
is corrosion or rust. Every particle of
steel therefore was covered first with a
coating of linseed oil and afterward with
a preparation of red lead. This was done
at the rolling-mills, and again when tha
steel beams were in place in the building*
As the structure approaches completion,
all of the steel frame is imbedded in con
crete, and is ihus proctically safe from tha
attack of dampness.
The wors of the mason in filling in the
partitions and setting the concrete floors
precedes the carpenters, who lay the
hardwood floors, ret the window-casings
and bang the doors. In comparison with
the other tradesmen the carpenter has bat
little to do. The amount of wood em
ployed is every small.
Then the building is in the hands of
the decorators and finishers, and when
they have done their part the great struc
ture is ready for the tenant.
A most important factor to be consid
ered by the architect in planning these
great structures is the effect of vibration
caused by the pressure of wind upon the
exposed area of the walls. The four sides
of The Call building comprise 87,000
square feet of surface. With the wind
blowing at only forty miles an hour the
pressure up to the twelfth floor is thirty
pounds to the square foot, and above that
elevation it is fifty pounds. The wind, if
blowing at that velocity, exerts a force
equal to 225,000 pounds pressure on one
of the four sides. Yet the vibration eren
at the lantern on the top is not percep
tible.18
THEY WASH THE
SOLDIERS' CLOTHES
There is no professional laundry at the Presidio. The soldiers
do not as a rule send their clothing: into the City to bs washed.
There must be some strange system there by which th's detail in the
life of every community is attended to. And there is. It is a strange
one, indeed. It i> nothing less than a tacit agreement that the wives
of the least affluent soldiers shall "take in washing/ which they do,
and over which they rub, rub, rub up and down in the soapsuds all
day long. The washing district is marked by a row of tenements
called "soapsuds row," which a "Call" artist has sketched below from
the actual scene. To this row eventually come soldiers' brides, to dispel
their girlish dreams of brass buttons in the foam of the washtub.
The road is bare that leads past the
life-saving station and up to the plain
brown houses that compose what is com
monly known as "Soapsuds Row." The
wind rushes in through the Golden Gate
and sweeps the dust into your eyes and
whistles on up the cliff and iiuo the trees,
where it loses its glee and sighs ou its
way into the City.
Alone the road just ahead of me a
man and woman struggled against the
elements. The winds brought their voices
to me clearly and distinctly.
"It's cold, Jim," she was saying, "awful
to be out in this wind. Now, if you didn't
have to go back again tnis afternoon" â
she hesitated and glanced at himâ "if you
didn't, you know, I'd build a tire for you
in tne front room."
He made no response, but trudged on
with his hands in his pockets and looked
out to sea.
"I could wheel the lounge up," she went
"on, crooning softly, with a note of antici
pated contentment in her voice, "and it
would be so warm and nice and cozy. If
you only could."
"I told you I couldn't," be said shortly.
"Yes; I know," she answered with the
little bird-nore of content all gone.
She hugged the big bundle she was
carrying closer, and struggled to keep her
baton. "I'd best get the clothes to soak,
I suppose," she said. "It will be easier."
They walked on and went up the few
steps of one of the plain, worn houses
and disappeared through the low door.
A schooner was proudly tacKing out to
sea, with the wind dashing itself against
the wide-spread sails with a Round like the
boom of a cannon, and the sun spark
ling on the waters all about her. Behind
her the graceful pilot-boat No. 3 danced
over the waves with rare enjoyment. Be
yond rose the green-brown hills, peaceful
beneath the fair sky, careless alike of the
wind or the moving mass of water.
A young girl was approaching and she
stopped wben she saw me and stood gaz
ing with the placid expression of a rumi
nating bovine. She chewed gum, too,
calmly and offensively, and I might have
found other points of similarity, but â
well, she had freckles as large as ginger
snap?, and those no cow ever had.
"Do you live out here?" I asked.
"My sister does. I stay sometimes.
Why?"
She snapped it out and dispelied all
idea of placidity.
"It is pleasant," I ventured, wrapr !
my skirt about me to keep it in its proper
place, and wondering if the feathers were
sewed securely on my bai.
"No, it am't â but it miâ¢ht be worre.
Everything might be worse," said this
new species of a philosopher, changing
the location of her gum to her pocket
h.indkerchief. "That's what I told sister.
She might not have the washing to do."
"Washing?"
"Yes, you know, they get paid for doing
the washing for the barracks. It ain't
easy work and I wouldn't marry an en- >
listed soldier and live up here for nothing;
but it's worse to go without the money.
They don't have more than $10 a month
besides, and usually about ten children to
feed."
"There ain't anything in this world j
what it looks like," she went on. "When }
my sister was married I couldn't take my j
eyes off of tiie uniformâ ibe blue suit and |
the cap and the brass buttons were too
much for me. My highest amDition was
to marry a man that could wear 'em."
'What changed you?" I asked.
"Wash-tubs." she replied. "There
wasn't a hint of 'em in his looks, but it
don't take long to find them when you
get out here." â¢
The houses were bare enough and small
enough.
A woman came and opened the door,
the while wiping her hands and wrists on
her apron.
"A drink of water? Certainly; come
in."
She led me through the small front
room and into the kitchen. A baby sat in
a high chair, one a bit older played about
on the floor, and a third stood in the door
way and stared.
"He won't come in," the mother said
when I spoke to him; "he just tore his
pants and the braid is hanging down. I've
just beer, scolding him.
"We never take the braid off the
clothes before we make them over for the
children. It shows the faded portions too
badly. So they wear the stripes the same
as their fathers."
"And they are proud of them?'
"Some times," she laughed, "there is
nearly as much rivalry among the chil
dren as among the men. The private's
son, without any stripes, is often made
quite miserable."
She was a tall woman with a pleasant
face, but one free from discontent only
when she laughed. I fancied an air of
unsuitability in her rrannerâ her way of
speaking and her voice did not sound in
place.
"Have you lived in the city always?"
â¢â¢Only a few years. I came from thÂ«
countryâ a country schoolteacher. Things
change," she said. "I get very home
sick for the green hills and the meadows
sometimes."
She look d at the bleak sand as we
stood on the steps, and shivered as the
cold wind canght her.
"I always think of it as being so warm
there." sue said. "Good-day."
And I thought of the schooner sailing
jrayly out to sea and what great grief she
would come to if she tried to sail down the
road. We were all made for a certain
element and in any other we are miser
able.
Yet fate settles us oftentimes in the
wrong places and stands back smiling in
grim enjoyment and watches while time
steals away with our hope-* and intents.
She is quite sure that we will not struggle
against her, and usually she is right.
I saw him come cut of the house and go
down the road tbward the Presidio, so I
went up and knocked.
"Come in," she said, wondering no
donbt what I wanted. I sat down in the
tiny room with its stuffy furniture and its
geometrically arranged rainbow tidies.

Still she would not have resented it it I

"No, ma'am," she answered, "they live

"And your husband?"

"Ynn have no children ?"
"No." She looked wistf'illy at me. "It
wouldn't be so bad if I had. I'd have
something to work for and look forward
to â caring for them, you know â but now.' 1
"But you may not be here always."
"So," she said. "I am trying to save
the money I get from the washing in case
I do not have to stay always.
â¢'But that is foolish," she went on.
"When I married I left my home, and
now it is broken up. Still, I cannot help
looking back."
When the wife of Lot, while journeying
away from her naive home, turned and
ooked with longing eyes back to the
place where all that she had loved lay in
ruins, she became for her pains a pillar of
salt. And I fancy that when men looked
at her stolid visage they found no smile
thereon, no look of cupidity, but only a
hopeless endurance.
Ana this woman was doing what that
other wife had doneâ looking backward;
and the change was going on in her
naturally. It needs no miracle to change
a woman when once she loses hope.
How strange it is that the misery of
other lives transfers a hint of the same
to one's own self. One feels line sitting
with them and saying, "All is illusion.
Let us be miserable. To-morrow will
never come."
And so it was a shock of surprise wben
I met the next face. There was no hope
! less endurance pictured there â nothing of
disappointment or hope deferred showed
about her. She was large to spare, and
she stood, a child clinging to either side,
squarely on her two feet as firmly as
though those feet were in grooves that
were maae for them. And the door
seemed the right size and the room beyond
was hers.
"Come right through," she said. "I'm
busyâ alwtys busy, to tell the truth. My
husband ain't borne, so you sit down
in the kitchen while I co on with my
washing."
And while she leaned over the board she
talked and told me of her life. It was not
an empty oneâ it was filled with her chil
dren and her husband.
"I miss him, of course," she said, "but
we're getting a start. If he was around I
wouldn't work mach and if I was around
I'd bother him. So we just go on and
compare notes when we meet. 1 take a
vacation and go up once in a while and
watch him drill, and he comas home and
rests and praises my work. The music
rests me, and if ever 1 get discontented
the sight of all the men in line inspires
me.
"Everybody is not contented like me? I
know, of course. Sometimes I'm sorry for
them. Some of the boys neglect their
wives, and drink and carouse when they
might be at home. It isn't that all of
them don't like the life, but there's one
little woman lives here that has no chil
dren. Lots of times her husband don't
come home for days, and then ; she wan*
ders up and down the beach in the even
ing and watches the water, when ii's cold
enough to freeze â and after she's
been washing all day." .
"Ana'he?" â¢ ' f
"Oh, he is in the guardhouse about
halt the time. It's too bad."
Small wonder that she looked back
; always with no change; in her lace.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 16, 1897.
Doubtless there were no changes in her
life and she knew not bow to make them.
There are some lives that are too strong,
root and brauch. to let these biting frosts
do more than passing damage. Others
have no warmtn within to thaw the cold
from without.
And the latter natures suffer less than
the former, ana the blame rests where the
strength and courage snould have come
from.
"Then," went on this good woman,
whose contented face was so restful,
"there are women out here who didn't
know what they were coming toâ who
married the uniform and thought it held
a man. There's one whose husband
brought her here a while agoâ a tall girl
with a dissatisfied look, who plays the
piano a good deal of the time.
"Fora while they had awlul rowsâ
they live in tne next house â and then he
wouldn't come home. She got reckless
and lonesome, I guess, and went out and
got acquainted with all ihe 'dough boys.'
People talked then, of course; and when
you get a lot of men to talking it's worse
than all the women in the country."
She leaned away from her wort and
looked at me.
"I'm afraid I'm gossiping," she said,
â¢'but I only feel sorry that they don't un
derstand, and will keep on blighting their
lives. I might rather live in comfort and

living; but wishing won't change it,
neither will moping around. I'd just

I felt as though the sun had suddenly
came forth from behind a cloudbank, and
resumed its course â the air was a degree
warmer, and the wind less troublesome.
Contentment in any form is new, but
without stagnation it is well nigh un
heard of.
Passing the next house I looked up at
the window, where a figure in a pale-blue
gown with a pale face and yellow hair and
blue eyes stood. It looked unsubstantial,
as different in appearance from tue other
woman as her life was in the living.
So I passed on. I did not want the feel
ing of good dispelled.
The children were playing in the sand,
building castles for the wind to blow down,
digging wells for the sand to till up. They
werebu-y; oh, so busy! with t eir laugh
ter and their quarreling; and their making
up. All the while the waves dashed on
the beach and rolled back again into the
sea.
"Ob, the energy wasted in all this great
worl'l," I mused aloud.
Bat some one there was wiser: "Sup
pose it all should cease â the children
should gaze sorrowfully out to sea be
cause their handiwork was not perma
nent, and the waves should be still and
the earth stop moving. It would ruin all
the universe, to which this wasted energy
is necessary. Suppose every one used the
energy they possessed."
There would be content without stagna

viable a place as the palace of the king.

A SULTAN
IN PRISON
A man who was at one time
Sultan of Turkey* has been a state
prisoner of that empire during the
past nineteen year. One of the
most enormous discrepancies of
state affairs that history has
ccked within its inescapable
volume displays itself in the
strange record of this man's
long imprison mrnt. A thread of
romance winding through it adds
a fiction-like element to the story.
Among the possibilities of the early
future, in case reverses should befall the
Turkish arms, is the deposition of Sultan
Abdul Humid, and the elevation to the
throne of the Porte of onÂ« who has been
a state prisoner for nineteen years and is
now wearing out his life behind the bars
in Malta kiosk. This is Murad the Fifth,
or Amurath, as he is sometimes called,
who was Sultan for a few weeks after tue
death of Abdul Aziz.
The great Sultan Mfthmad. who did so
much for Turkey, died in 1839 and was
succeeded by Abdul Mejid. This new
sovereign trod in his brother's footsteps,
but tho reforms he sought to effect were
resisted by ignorant and pig-beaded olli
cials, and they had been only partly car
ried into effect when he died, in 1861.
He was succeeded by a coarse and un
cultivated brute named Abdul Aziz. He
was the son of a Kurdish mother, and in
herited all the savagery of her race. At
the age of 5 he used to tear live pigeons to
pieces for his and her amusement; at 15
he tore in pieces a beautiful Bulgarian
girl who had disdained his advances. He
was a modern Caracalla, and his reign is a
record of atrocities almost incredible.
His chief pleasure was hunting slaves
with bloodhounds. Ht was loathed and
execrated by his people, and conspiracies
against his life were never-ceasing. Un
der his rule the state ot the country be
came dreadful. Hunger and discontent
reigned everywhere. Workmen were
starving; soldiers were unpaid. Midhat
Pasha and Teraskien Hussein Avni, the
Spartan, were at their wits' end to avoid a
revolution. They finally resolved to an
ticipate the inevitable.
The Sultan had a nephew named Murad,
a young man of Inch education, noble
instincts, liberal principle?, broad intel
ligence and a kind heart. He was so
tolerant that the Turkish Tories calud
him a Giaour. To him went Avni, the
Spartan, saying:
"Prince, a common danger threatens Ã¼b.
We must act promptly. All is arranged.
Two desperate men have sworn to assas
sinate Aziz at the baretulik. You will
take his place as Sultan."
"No, no; I will not hear of it. At the
price of a murder the throne would bo
pdions to me," was the reply.
At 2 o'clock in the morning of May 29,
1676, while the Sultan was dreaniinc of
lair Circassian girls aud Lucullan fvasts.
Redif Pasha forced his way into the mon
arch's be<l chamber,- woke him with the
announcement tuat he Had been deoosed
and that he must leave the palace at once
with all bis wives and effects and repair
to the fortress of Top Capon. Aziz raged
in inarticulate fury, but the palace was
surrounded by troops, and be had no
choice but to obey. It was not the inten
tion of TerasKien Avni to murder him; he
could do better than that. He made it nis
business to torture and exasperate the de
posed monarch, goaded turn to fury by all
manner of petty annoyances, made the
chains of bis captivity unbearable, nagged
him to chafe and fret bis soul out, teased
him with infinite malices, until he was
like a wild beast. In a paroxysm of iaue
he borrowed a pair of scissors from an at
tendant, opened a vein in hiÃ arm and
let the blood flow till he dieJ.
Then Murad was duly crowned Sultan.
His unexpected elevation brought out
traits in his character which had not been
observed. He was a passionate lover of
the fair sex and kept a harem of beauties
to whom he paid such assiduous devotion
that his nervous system broke down under
the strain. He sought to build himself
up with champagne and failed.
The political crisis ia which he found
himself required cool resolution and
bodily and mental strength; he was in a
constant lever of excitement, nerveless,
and the thought was ever present to his
mind that lie would be accused of the
murder of his uncle; insinuations of his
guilt had in part appeared in the papers.
They overthrew his brain. He could not
sleep. Ho denounced Avni for having
covered him wit^ sharae, and declared
that he wished for nothing but death.
The question was, Was Murad mad or
not? The Constantinople doctors did
not know what to make of his case. The
ablest alienist of Vienna, Dr. Liedesdorf,
said that the Sultan was suffering from a
severe attack of nervous depression, which
had temporarily unsettled bis reason,
but that a few weeks' rest, with occupa
tions which would divert his mind, would
restore him to health. But an Itaiian
quack named Capoleone declared that the
disease was softening of the brain, and,
though the patient's life might bb pro
tracted by copious blood-letting, leeches,
hot baths and powerful dru-rs, the case
would terminate fatally within six
month?. It was Miuhat's interest to be
lieve the quacK in preference to the
physician.
Early one morning a eunuch entered
Murad's apartment and announced to
him that a new Sultan, Abdul Humid,
commanded him to leave the palace and
go with his family to Top Capon. He
obeyed with perfect listlessness. He took
no notice of surrounding objects, but
slowly followed the soldier* who escorted
him. He paid no attention to the salute
of the sentinels, but entering his harem-
Ijk, lie sat down apathetically on a sofa.
His mother, who accompanied him, did
not weep nor lament, but said in a calm,
sad voice, "It is the will of Allah."
This was just at the time when the Rus
sians were forcing the passage of the
Balkans, and the siege of Plevna was at
tracting the attention of the world. On
the following day Abdul Hamid was pro
claimei Sultan in the presence of a silent,
frowning crowd, who hnd not a cheer for
their new sovereign.
Mu rail's wives were sent adrift â all but

to i..c dud and melancholy prisoner with
the snow-white hair and the gentle ac
cents. The Sultan reluctantly consented
to her sharing- bis prison. He suspected
every one, but he reckoned that his police
would De vigilant enough to prevent her
plotting, and be let her stay. Sha soon
discovered opportunities of usefulness and
lost no time in devising means of putting
her schemes into effect.
Constantinople was full of yonng men,
who wore ready for any desperate enter
prise against the Sultan. Every college
graduate was a conspirator ex-officio, and
a member of the Young Turkey party.
All were agreed that when the time came
for action they woulJ restore to the throne
the dedishado, who was wise and benevo
lent, and thoroughly in touch with the
latest evolution of modern political
scionce. But Murad was so closely
guarded that it was almost impossible for
him to communicate with his friends out
side. It was then that Almeh brought
her mother-wit to bear on the case. In
moments of privacy he wrote letters on
tissue-paper, which she rolled up and in
serted in quill?. The quills were cropped
into water and were carried off into the
drain pipes. Marad's friends tapped the
drains outside and caught the quills as
they passed.
The trick served for quite awhile. Then
it was discovered, and a faithful waiting
woman warned Almeh that her life was
not worth an hour's purchase. Tnis ser
vant procured a boy's costume, in which
Almeh managed to elude the guards. She
fled with rapidity, under the watchfulness
of members o! the New Turkey party, till
she got safely on board a British steamer.
The police followed her to the vessel and
demanded her surrender, but a British
ironclad happening to range up alongside
with a manifest intention to take part in
any controversy which might arise the
monchards did not think it worth while
to pursue their enterprise. Murad now
conspires alone. John Bonnf.e.
A SAN FRANCISCAN IN
SALISBURY CATHEDRAL
Miss Heineman, well known in San Francisco artistic circles, has
sent to "The Call" another ot those descriptive articles on Euro
pean treasures, as viewed through the eye of an artist, which have, as
a series, become so enjoyable to people of culture and intelligence on
this coast. The letter here following:, together with the pen sketches,
which were made on the spot by Miss Heineman, deal with the famous
old Salisbury Cathedral and the equally historic Castle of the Druids,
one within a few hours' drive of the other. Probab y no one from
California heretofore has gone to the same degree of pains with an
equal degree of iitness for the task to portray these monuments of the
past to the people of our newer but none the less appreciative world.
The foundation of Salisbury Cathedral,
England, is lost in a maze of amusing
le^er.ds. Some of the old pillars were cer
tainly carried from the original catheiiral
in old Sarum, where we still see. just out
side of the walls of Salisbury (new Sarum),
the vast relics of a once flourishing and
populous city.
It was to old Sarum that representatives
of all tiie states of the kingdom were sum
moned to do homage to William the Con
queror. Under Bishop Roger, styled
"Roger the Great," the fortress of old
Sarum was part of the bishopric and the
splendors of the princely pageants were
unsurpassed. In the civil wars of Stephen
Roger was disgraced and the feuds began
between the rival factions of the cathedral
and the castle; the soldiers of the garri
son insulted the ecclesiastics or ihe castle
and fortress was dismantled as the forces
of Stephen or Maud obtained possession.
The situation of the city was in many
ways inconvenient, water was scarce and
ihe cathedril stood so high that, accord
ing to tradition, "Wh*n the wind blew
they could not hear ttie priests say mass."
The quarrel between the military and
tbeclerical authorities increased iv venom.
On one occasion, after a solemn proces
sion, the priests found themselves shut out

from their possessions and were compelled
to stand in the questionable shelter of a
high wall during the whole of a sharp
winter's night. It was Peter de Blois who,
infuriated by the insensate attacks, ex
claimed at last, at the end of his pa
tience, "Wnat has the house of tho Lord
to do with castles? It is the Ark of the
Covenant in a temple of Baalim. Either
place 13 a prison. Let us, in God's name,
descend into the level, where there are
rich champaigns and fertile valleys. There
is a seat for the virgin patroness of our
church!"
Accordingly the site for the new cathe
dral was chosen by shooting an arrow
from the ramparts of the old town. The
Ca'hciral of Salisbury was begun, and the
inhabitants of old Sarum actually gath
ered up "their houses and waited."
In 1540 the ruins of the castle were still
standing, but the remaining houses were
deserted; only a chapel of Our Lady wan
maintained and two vicars were appointed
to minister there. Until the time of the
Reformation the two lonely priests offered
their daily mass, intoned their solemn
chants in this '-Silent City of the Dead."
Many of the old monumen's that fill the
wide aisles of tne "new" cathedral date
from the original church; grotesque and
stiff, with obliterated features and muti
lated forms, they add the last touch of
dignity to a cathedral unique in itself tor
the purity of its gothic forms and for the
splendor of its stained glass â a glitter of
silver and green, lite the sparkle of green
chartreuse. The so-called restorations
have much to answer for in Salisbury, but
fortunately they have left free the beau
tiful cloisters around a quadrangle where
great cedars cast their heavy shadows
over the quiet grass and every sunken
stone bears a faint, half-obliterated epi
taph.
From Salisbury it is but 8 short carriage
drive to another famous pile. The car
riages rattle over the undulating, fruitful
downs; infrequent glimpses of those
charming pastoral scenes that make all
the counties of old England look like the
pages of a story-book meet the eye. But

soft beds ot pink ana gold, thatched farms

ABOVE THE CLOUDS
Edward S. Holden, the astronomical expert and director
of Lick Observatory, has just issued, through the Smithsonian
Institution, the first book ever written giving an accurate idea
of the mountain observatories of the world. Few works of
fiction are more interesting than this plain recital of facts. It
is a story of hardship, starvation and deadly peril that have
befallen men who have labored on and on in the interests
of science. The illustrations are drawn from photographs.
Much cf the information concerning the
heavenly bodies of wliich we read is gained
under circumstances and at heights which
would fill us with awe if we only knew tue
real truth. It teils how scientists rind
wonderful facts above the clouds. Profes
sor Holden's object in in :iting this work
is to outline the conditions suitable for
astronomical labor at high levels. It tells
ot the work of the Harvard College eipe-

dition on El Misti, that stand* 19.200 feet
above the sea's level. It describes the me
teorological station on the Sonnblick,
which is 9543 feet above old ocean. It
tells us of the hairbreadth escapes and
constant danger that fall to the lot of
those wbo take observations on Mont
Blanc. The results of Dr. Miller's labors
on the Santis are revealed, and the story
is also told of what transpires on the sum
mit of famous Mount Hamilton. In a
word, it is a resume of th<? efforts of scien
tists 03 mountain peaks from the time of
Professor Piazzi-Smitii at thepeaKof Ten
enfre in 1356 to the latest achievements in
far-away India.
The modern mountain astronomical ob
servatory is the legitimate descendant.
Professor Holden says, of Galileo's tower
of Arcetri. The inhabitants of the earth
know the external universe directly only
throusn the sense of sight, and our terrss
trial view* of the planets and stars are
much modified by the action of our own
atmo-phere upon the rays of their light
which reach our eyes. We are, as it were.
immersed in an ocean cf air, and one of
the first problems of astronomical physics
is to determine the effects of this over
lying ocean upon the light from external
bodies which penetrates its depths. Light
moves in straight lines in empty space,
but light entering our atmosphere is re
fracted from its course so that the ray
which enters our nye from a siar no longer
t.-aveli in its primitive direction.
The necessity for mountain observa
tories arises from the fact that in order to
secure correct observation of the heavenly
bodies it is necessary that the telescope be
as (ar as possib'e from what is known as
the dust shell of the earth and in an at
mosphere wnich is steady. I3y steady
atmosphere is meant that where the 2ir
is not constantly in motion. The air is
in strata just a^ is the earth. When one
is above t"be strata that arc more generally
affected by the air currents it will be no
ticed that the stars twinkle far less than
xinder other conditions. Now, the twink
linc of stars is the result of curvature of
atmospheric strata caused by air currents.
When these air currents do not act then
the atmosphere is steady and correct ob
servation is rendered easy.
All these things being realized by the
â astronomers acted npon them just as the
tradition of an undiscovered country af
fects the explorer. The results as told by
Frofessor llolden seem marvelous. Ob
servatories ou high mountains must
cither be abandoned altogether during

The highest meteorological observatory
in the world has been located by the
Harvard College observatory expedition
on the mountain peak knows as E! Misti,
one of th? Andes, whose height 13 19,2 C0
feet, or 4SOO feet higher than Pikes Peak
in our own United States. Among the
more interesting are the observatories on
the Sonnblick, in Austria, and the Santis
which are under the control of the Pots- j
dam astrophysical observatory, one of the
most noted in Europe. Then there if the i
observatory on the ever- famous Mont

the most daring work ever accomplished '
by the devotees of science. The first of |

It is located at Petropolis. Thus far the
work accomplished there has not been
such as to give the institution an interna

The best known of all our observatories
is that on Mount Hamilton, in California,
which bears the name of the man through
whose generosity it was built, James Lick.
It was erected under the direction of trus

to t he plans p eparetl by Professor Holden
and Professor Newton. Tins observatory,

telescope in the â¢world, excepting the
great Yerkes telescope, placed in position
not long ago at a point on the shore of
L-ike Geneva, Wisconsin. Professor
Holden, by the way, thinks that unless
the conditions at Lake Geneva are dis
tinctly better than those of the region

largest of telescopes may prove to have
been an error of judgment.

the entire twenty-four hours. The days
are warm, though not oppressive, because
of the dryness of the atmosphere. The
vision during the day is usually unsteady

The large valley of Santa Clara lies all
day long in the ardent suns.hine. Late in
the afternoon the sea fog begins to creep
in through the various gaps in the Coast
Range, which borders the Santa Clara
Valley on the west, and to come toward
the north from Monterey Bay through
the valley of the Pnjaro River. A local
fog from the bay of San Francisco often
s^ntls its thinner veils toward the south,
but seldom penetrates as far south as
Giiroy.where the Monterey fog is entering.
Up to this time the fogs are low lying.
As the afternoon goes on, the soa fog rises
higher and higher and often pours over
the tops of the highest; peak 3of the Coast
Range that tower 3038 feet, completely
covers the valley of Santa Clara and tills
the neighboring canyons, although it
seldom rises to the observatory's level,
being usually a thousand feet lower. Thus
the scientists at Lick Observatory are
above the clouds and gain news from the
heavenly bodies while they, to the ma
jority of persous, are invisible. Once in
a while the foe covers the summit of
Mount Hamilton, but only about as often
as the equinoctial storms come.
Harvard College observatory, of which
we have already learned through the
South American chain of stations, has a
meteorological observatory on Pikes
Peak, 14,134 feet in altitude. For fifteen
years this station was continually occupied,
but now the observations are generally
confined to the summer month?. A nota
ble leature ol the Pikes Peak observatory
is the fact that the most tremendous elec

ica teem to cluster about its summit. The
Hjrhtoing is nearly continuous for long
periods, and the deep rolling thunder is
shattering to the strongest nerves.
The observers on the mountain summit,
although much incommoded by these
electrical storms, have learned how to ar
range their insiruments so as to avoid all
real danger. It was from this point, in
July, 1878, that Dr. Langley observed the
total solar eclipse. Other observatories of
note on this continent are those of:
Flagstaff, Ariz.. 7300; Echo Mountain,
Cal., 3500 feet; Chamber lin Observatory,
in Denver, Colo., 5400 feet; the National
Observatory of Mexico, at Tacubaya, 7500
feet.
No observatory exists around â¢which
more interest clusters than that at Mont
Bianc, whicn rears its snowy heaa 15,780
feet from the surface of the ocean. The
story of this observatory, of the dangers
of those wno have utilized it, are succeed
ing chapters in the traeedy of human ex
istence such as science cannot elsewhere
produce. This observatory was erected
by M. Janssen upon compressed snow, be
cause no rock foundations were available.
It is provided with jackscrews, in order
that it may be leveled if necessary.
The base of the structure 13 10 by 5
meters and the snow always covers the
lower story. It was the intention to leave
the upper story in free air, and duiii>g ob
servation a telescope is mounted in an alu
minum dome above the upper story. The
construction is very solid and strong, with
double walls and liters, and no pains have
been snared to make it safe and rigid. As
an indication of the character of the founda
tion of the observatory, tunnels were run
thirty-six lect below the surface without
meeting rock. The temperature in these
tunnels at all times was three degrees
above zero.
The cost of building on those heights is
very great. The building erected by M.
Janssen caused an expense of ?(JO,OOO.
Ordinary laborers are paid 20 francs a day.
The price for transporting material to the
summit was 23cents a pound. The ordi
nary load for a porter in such cases was
twenty-six pounds. The minimum tem
perature on the summit of Mont Blanc
is 43 degrees below zero. The top of the
mountain is, in fact, a glacier.
On the Sonnbliclc ob ervatory there is
eight times as much snowfall as rainfall.
The twinKling of the stars is regularly ob
served at this point, and, strangely
enough, is considerably greater than at
the lower station. The movements of the
barometer, the wind pressures and velo
cities, the relative humidity, the forma
tion and movements of cloudo, the amount
of atmospheric electricity and all meteoro
logical phenomena are daily observed.
There are at this observatory on the aver
age 250 days each year when the mercury
stands at zero or below.
The observatory of the Rantis is one of
the least expensive, considering its im
portance, of any that exi3t?, for t fie total
expense of maintaining it is $1200 a year.
Ilb original cost was $12,000. In all of the
observations taken the steadintsa of thi
air, as well as its transparency, are not
able. The star images are entirely free
from twinklin?. Each star, viewed from
the observatory, shows a magnitude one
tenth brighter than that observed at a
point on a level with the sea.
The highest German meteorological sta
tion or observatory is the Weiulelstein on
the northern slopes of the Alps, near
Munich. Its altitude is 1537 meters. The
most famous station in Franco is Puv-de-
Dome, 1400 meters above the level of the
sea. It was here that Pascal caused lm
barometric experiment to be tried in 1643.
The highest French station is the Pic-du-
Midi, 2877 meters high. The Ben Nevis
Observatory, 43<i8 feet above the sea's
level, located on one of ihe highest
mountains of Scotland, is devoted purely
to meteorological observations because of
the rarity of sunshine there. For in
stance, in December, 1893, the sun shone
for but a single hour, and that was all the
time it was seen during the entire year.
The newest obseryatory, and one of
which astronomers hope much, has just
been erected in the Palani Hills, in India,
at a height of 7700 feet. It is known a3
theKodiakanal Solar Physics Observatory.
There are over 2COO hours of sunshine at
this point yearly, and the experiments
thus far conducted show that the atmos
phere i 9 steady as well as clear. The
climate of the location is utterly different
from anything with which Europeans or
Americans are familiar.
Professor Holden draws particular at
tention in his interesting work io
the observatory at Nice, peculiar for the
fact o: its being devoted entirely to astron
omy. This institution is located on
Mont Gros and is onh' lICO feet above
the sea's level. Under good circumstances
the transparency and purity of the air at
Nice are remarkabie. If the di-k of the
sun be hidden by a screen there 'is no
glare in the field even to the point of tan
gency. The Nice Observatory has an an
nex on the summit of Mont juounier,
8803 feet high. The station is equipped
not only for astronomical observation but
for meteorological as well.
In closing this resume of observatories
it is well to refer to the astronomical ob
servatory on Mount Etna, 9652 feet above
, the sea. During the favorable season the
MONOLITHIC CHURCH OF HAMMANUEL. -
lens is mounted at the summit. At other |
times of ihe year it ii employed at
Catania. The Etna station is reached by
a drive of about eleven miles over a car
riage road to Nicolosi, and from thenca on
horseback In six hours, provided the traii
is not obstructed by snow. Several im
portant "series of observations, heving for
their object the relative advantages of
hi;;h and low level observing stations,
have been carried out on Etna by famous
astronomers.
Professor Holden, in the wortc from
wiiich tliese fact 3 are taken, has laid be
fore the world its first opportunity to ob
serve in continuous form the achieve
ments of the astronomer and the meteor
ologist. Who can say that In daring,
Dravery and heroism they do not compare
favorably with the tales of exploration
with which history is replete?

"Wiienceor where the glove originated is
unknown. A plausible theory sugeests
that the early man invented them for use
in liis slow and painful labor among thb
bushes. A very rough, homely glove it
must have been, of untauned skins of
coarse fabric and lingeries*.
They are mentioned in Homer as hav
ing been worn by Laertes in his retire
ment, and Xcnopbon makes mention of
Cyrus' gloves. Tlieir use was held up to
scorn by both these writers, and among
Orientals was considered a mark of effem

popularity among men of wealth and

INTERNAL VIEW.
CHURCHES THAT ARE
UNDER THE GROUND
Imagine buildings whose roofs are on a level with the
surface of the ground. Consider also the fact that they are
hewn from one solid stone and that the entrances to them are
at the bottom of trenches at least fifty feet deep. You may
think they do not exist. But they do, and A. Raffrey, the
well-known traveler, has just made public through La Nature
some interesting facts about them. The edifices referred to
are eh urches located in Abyssinia and known as monoliths.
â  Although one of the oldest and most
historic countries in the world, Abyssinia
is at the same time one of the least
known. Hundreds of travelers have vis
ited it in the iaierest of science, and yet
something new is always being found
there. The monolithic churchos of this
land have long been conceded to be
among the strangest edifices in the world,
and as early as ten years a^o 200 of them
had been found. Now comes a famous
traveler who teils of another group, com
pared to which the others are in?i:Â»nin
cant. They are really wonders of archi-
tecture. They are too important to be
called curiosities.
It might accra strange that these
churches, although still devoted to wor
ship, should be concealed from the scien
tific world for so long, bat when all is
known there is little to be wondered at.
It is several years since Mr. Raff rey visited
the churches, but the facts hogieaned and
the pictures of ihem have just been made
public.
Tne word monolith, in its broadest sense,
means anything which is cut from a single
stone. Tne wonderful Egyptian sphynx
is a monolith and the Nile country la cov
ered with examples of this style of archi
tecture, if such it can be called.
However, they are for the most part
pyramids or shrines and appear to have
been cut from bowlders which were lying
TOP OF MONOLITHIC CHURCH OF GHORGHIS.
on the earth's surface. The 200 monolithic
churches of Abyssinia are of this order,
but those bf the last croup, which Mr.
Raff rey discovered, are different from any
other known editice on tfco face of the
earth.
The location of these churches is the
town of Lalibela, Abyssinia, a place sev
eral hundred miles off the beaten path 3of
travel. Neither the European nor Abys
sinian traders pass anywhere near it, and
not many natives even know of the exist
ence of the place. It is an exclusively re
ligions town of about .Â°>ooo inhabitants, and
Jlr. Itaffrey was the only white man to en
ter it for a couple of centuries. In fact
there wai nobody in the town who had
ever seen n European.
In order to reach Lalibela it is necessary
to travel several days from the town of
Agula on the coast, over a roueh, barren
and broken country that is desolate ana
forbidding in the extreme. The country
is practically uninhabited, unless consid
eration is tatcn of the Nomadic tribes and
wild beasts.
On reaching Lelibela there is nothing
to be seen but the usual array of dirty
huts that constitute every Abyssinian
town. The eartli suriace isrockv hills al
most devoid of vegetation. Where are
the churches? is what any traveler would
ask himself, and he would probably think
he had been deceived in regard to them,
as there is not a sign of any building de
serving of that name.
According to Mr. Raffrey's description
these churches are only too easy to find.
In fact, a man who attempted to cross the
town at night would most likely be made
aware of their location with a suddenness
that would be anything but agreeable.
The first indications of thorn are vast
openings in the earth's surface. Some of
these are long ana sinuous, bnt they all
lead to the doors of the churches. The
roofs of the churches are on a level with
the surface of the gronnd.
To a thorough understanding of
how these churches are built, somo ex
planation is neccessary. The country in
the vicinity of Lahbela consists of a layer
of earth only a few feet in thickness
spread over an almost solid Ded of sand
stone. In no place is it possible to find a
hill that would be called steep. All are
rolling, so that a few hundred feet of
surface, no matter where located, would
not be far from the level.
The first thing to be done, therefore, in
building one of these mountain chnrches
was to hew out a huge trench of rectangu
lar form in such a way as 10
leave an enormous block of stone
in the center. The size of tho
trench, of course, depended on the size
tne church was to be. In most cases an
inclined trench leading to the surface
wa3 also cut, but in a number of in
stances the only way to get into the
cbnrch is by the ase of a ladder. In some
instances the trench is U-shaped, leaving
the block of stone attached to the hill at
one side, but generally ie is free on the
four sides.
After the block was freed from the hill
side in the desired manner the work of
the architect began, and what he accom
plished seems almost incredible. The out
side walls were cut into colonnades, pillars
and even porticos, and in some instances
elaborately carved. Steps and balustrades
were cut from the solid rock.
Work then commenced on the interior.
This was hollowed out in such a way as
10 leave pillars to support the roof, arches
and naves. Windows to admit light and
air were cut, and then the work of carv-
ing ornaments commenced. In many
cases these were quite elaborate.
Tbe finished church consisting of one
rock and entirely free from mortar pre

were composed of a thousand pieces, each.
laboriously cut from the quarry and
hauled to the desired spot and carefully
laid in place.
As nenr as they can resernKe any given
style of architecture these ciiurches con
form to the Byzantine. They all iace the
east and are free from inscriptions of any
kind. In some instances the churches
are built in groups and have tunnels or
vaulted passageways connecting them.
The walls of the churches are from three
to five feet thick and the roof from three
to six feet, strengthened, of course, by the
arches and pillars.
As regards size, a description of tha
church of Hammanuol will suHice for
many of the others. It is the finest of the
group and also one of the largest. From
this comparisons of the others may* be
raaCe. It, as well as the court that sur
rounds it, is cf rectaneular form. The
court is 93 feet in length, 78 in width and
38 in depth. The church is 58 feet in
length and 38 in v.idth. In* the court
there ia a small baptistery in the form of
a Greek cross. The edih'ce stands upon a
sort of sub-basement in steps. The large
facades show three stories containing
fifteen openings, one of which \s a door.
Tno windows of the ground floor are
cross-shaped, those of the lirst story are
arched and provided with capital.*, and
ihose of the second are square. Between
each window there is a colonnade and
several fiat moldings or flat bands.
The Ghorghis (George) church is in the
form of a Greet cross and in size nearly
equal to the preceding. Tha accompany
ing picture gives the aspect presented
at the level of the ground by the mono
liihs just described. The otner churches
of Lalibela ere .generally of smaller size,
although they have necessitated impor
tant work of excavation.
It is to Negus Lalibela that the honor
of constructing these churches belong.
He was a ruler who reigned about the
twelfth century and to whom Abyssinian
tradition assigns one of the greatest of
mystic roles.

at about $600.
She was in the habit of carrying them
tewed up in a pocket in the inside of her
dress, and Friday night, while dressing
herself in her room in the Baldwin Hotel
before going to the theater, she took them
out of her pocket. She is not clear as to
what she did with them afterward, but
she missed them after the first act and
hurried from the theater to her room.
She made a careful search for them, bat
could not find them.
The police were notified and Captain
Bohen personally made an investigation,
but could find no trace of the diamond*.
A further search yesterday met with a
similar result.
The diamonds consist of a stone used as
a pendant and valued at $400, a marquise
ring with a diamond in the center and
three small diamonds.

ELECTRICITY TO
REPLACE GAS
The Proposition Made by
Superintendent King to
the Merchants.
Gas Lamps to B3 Done Away
With in Certain Business
Localities.
Eoulevards and M rket Street to Ec
Illuminated an:! Made Avenu s
of Brauty.
Superintendent King has submitted the
following communication to the Mer
chants' Association on the subject of im
proving the lighting of the streets by sub
stituting electric lights for gas lamps:
San Francisco. May 4, 1897.
F. W. Dohrmann, President Merchants' Asso
ciationâDear Sir: 1 beg to submit Herewith
the following report and plan for a general
system of electric-lighting of this City, to
gether with a map showing number and loca
tion of proposed electric lights and the gas
lamps which would thereby be dispensed
Mapâ The proposed electric lights are indi
cated by large red dots, the gas lamps which
will be dispensed with by greec crosses, the
gas lamps which will be retained on those
streets by red crosses, and the electric lignts
which the City has already installed on the
streets In question by large purple dots.
Principleâ The leading principle of this sys
tem is tnat of suspending an arc light in the
center of each crossing of all the business
streets of the City, and dispensing with the
adjacent gas lamps, which will thereby be
rendered unnecessary.
Exceptionsâ The exceptions to this rule are
Market street, certain blocks south ol Market
street and a lew blocks in the wholesale dis
trict which will be referred to later on. Busi
ness streets are considered to be all those
streets throughout the City upon which a ma
jority of the fronUge is occupied by business
houses Which remain open during the even
ing.
Boulevardsâ ln addition to the regular Dusi
ness streets it is also proposed to place electric
lights at each crossing ou Golden G>ite avenue,
from Market to Devisadero, and on Folsom as
far out as Nineteenth street. It seems very de
sirable that the mam thoroughfare to the
park should be Well lightsd and ihus made
attractive to persons driving. a;.d particularly
to those riding bicycles to the purs ut night.
In order that the Mission residents may b3
equally well treated, their boulevmd, Foisom
street, hiis been included in the same system,
and this will thereby be made tae iavonte
highway at night lor the residents south of
Market street. In this connection, I would
call attention to the fact that Folsom street,
from Nineteenth to Twenty-sixth, is at pres
ent lighted in this mannner.
Gas lamps displacedâ Upon nil the streetÃ
above mentioned, the blocks of which are 275
and 412Jj feet in length, I estimate that four
gas lamps will be dispensed with for every
electric light installed. On those street* south
of Market, where the blocks are 550 feet in
length, or double the length of those blocks
north of Market, It seems only right that, on
the main business streets, such as Third,
Fourth, Fifth, fcixth. Ninth and Sixteenth, an
additional light should be placed in the middle
of each block, thus making these lights the
same distance apart as those nortn of Market.
The placing of these aiditional lights will,
however, dispense with only one additional
gas lamp in each block, but it will be necessary
to have them so placed.
Chinatownâ Dupont and other streets in
Chinatown are not included in this schedule
for the reason that on account of the many
dark alleys it is necessary to have many lights
well distributed, and this can be done better
with gas lamps.
Wholesale districtsâ The wholesale commis
sion district nortn of California street and the
foundry district south of Market are not In
cluded in this schedule, as little, if any, busi
ness is done there at night. That poi tion of
the wholesale district bounded by Market,
California and San some, being traveled by
many people going to and from the ferries,
will have electric lights on every other cross
ing and gas lamps on the intermediate cross-
inga.
Market streetâ The lighting of Market street
has been carefully considered, and it is be
lieved that the following plan will give the
best results: It is proposed to suspend over
the center of the street an unbrokon line of
lights reaching irom the ferries to Valencia
street. The lights to be p.nc d as follows:
From East to Second street, lhe blocks on the
south side being 275 feet lone, a light will be
suspended opposite the intersection of each
of the streets south of Market. On the suc
ceeding blocks, wheh are 825 teet long, in
addition to the ones opposite tha intersection,
there will be two additional lights at equal
distances between. On the 550-feet blocks
will be one ligbl between the intersections.
This will require thirty-five lights for the en
tire length of Market street, all about 300 feet
apart.
In order to do away with the uns'ghtly ap
pearance of the usual lot ot wires and ropes
required to haul the lamps to the side of the
street to be trimmed it is proposed to suspend
these lights from small wire cables stretched
from the s:ae of the street, and the wires con
ducting the electricity are to be inclosed in
conduits and i&stened close against the cable.
All :opes will be dispensed with and the lamp
trimmed from the center oi the street between
the tracks. By this method ihero will be seen
only a small wire caDle crossing the street,
which will be no more objectionable than the
many similar cables now there. Upon con
sultation with the electric-light company I
have been assured that this plan is entirely
feasible. It is proposed to suspend the lamps
in the center of the street rather than alter
nately on the sides for the following reasons:
Firstâ To place thorn along the sides would
require a much greater number, and irom
Third to Seventh their effect would be com
pletely destroyed by the greater number of
arc lights in fiont of show-window?.
Secondâ Because the effect of such a long
string of electric lights, reaching trom the
ferries to Valeucia, a difference of nearly a
mile and a half, will be very impressive,
particularly to visitors, as they come up from
the ferries.
"Costâ The cost of this system of lighting will

be as follows: In all districts north of Market
and in the Western Addition one electric light
will displace four gaslamps. Taking the fl?
--urs of the present contract of the City thesa
four gaslnnips would cost 48 cents per night
Â«nd the electric lights 55 cents per night, or 7
cents extra per night for each electric tlÂ»ht.
The total number of electric lights required
for this schedule is 231. and the number of
giiMnmps ih'tt would be divpunsed wiih is
1042. This would moke the contol 281 elec
tiic lights at 55 cents each $154 55 per night,
and there would be a savin* of 1042 guslamps
at 12 cents each, amounting io $125 04 per
night, which makes a total increase in cost of
this system only $29 51 per night, or $796 77
permonuiof tweuiy-.-even days or $9561 24
per year.
It seems, however, that these figures could
be considerably red ui-ed. Tne cosr of electric
lights Io the City at present is 55eentsper
nigi'tforall night ligh.s. I understand that
all-night lights are bsing furnished to private
parties for a 1 ss price thau this. From the in
lormatinn on handitcau b: safely assumed
thai i: the company could furnish these odd:
tional lights lor as low a price as all-night
lights sre fu'inshed for in some parts of tha
City the total extra cost for substituting
electric lights according to the a boy â¢â  schedule
would not amount to more than $5000 a year.
I believe the number ol gasiamps which could
t>e dispensed with can be increas-d from
twenty-five to fifty. In mnking above estimate
only tnoso lamps which would be plainly use
less were considered.
A en reful comparative study at night of the
lighting oi electric lights on crossings only,
and the pr-sent effec of gÂ«s lighting shows
lhat on all 275 and 412^ foot blocks the light
ing by elect'ic lights on crossing* is infinitely
better than the present system of gas lamps,
and is sufficient ior all purposes of travel.
On those blocks where the business house*
wish a brilliant illumination they can, If
lights are on crossings, easily raise by sub
scription enough to place one or two addl
tionnl 12 o'clock lights on such block--. After
12 o'clock lights on crossings are sufficient for
all Durposes. It also seems probable that after
one year's trial of lights on crossings on the
business streets the people will become so edu
cated to the better service and small difference
in cost that when the new contract is made
one year hence they will demand that the
system be extended throughout the greater
portion of the residence district. Respect
mlly submitted, L. M. King,

BIG MINING DEAL.
The San Philipe Mining and De
veloping Company Has
Been Organized.
Claims Set Forth by Its Promoters
and Its Guarantee to Capi
ta Invest d-
Probably the most novel and what it
claimed to be one of the best mining spec
ulations that has presented itself in the
field of investment for some time past
comes in the inauguration of a mining
company incorporated in this City during
the past few weeks, which bids for specu
lation in its stock and at the same time
guaranteeing a net profit of 100 per cent
at the expiration of three years to the
holders of shares, giving as security for
such guarantee valuable San Francisco
property now heid In trust by the Union
Trust Company of tnis City.
The corporation in question is the San
Phillpe Mining and Developing Company,
oreanized to operate and develop mines
situated in the heart of the richest mining
district of California.
Mr. F. H. Loftus is the promoter of this
enterprise as well as the owner of the
property. When seen at his office Ht 620
Market street he had the following to say :
"I am owner of mining property which I
am confident will yield a big income if
worke i properly, but having suffered like
others by reason of the recent financial
stringencies all over the country, have not
sufficient ready capital to launch the en
terprise and reap the very large profits
that I am confident will accrue.
"But beinj; the owner of extensive and
valuable realty interests in San Francisco,
I offer these as security to all wbo bay
stock in my mine, as a guarantee that the
San Philipe mine will pay investors at
least 100 per cent profit on their invest
ment within three years.
"I have placed in escrow a deed for
property which will so to tQe stockhold
ers of the corporation shou d I fail to
meet my expectations in the mine and
not be able to net the investors 100 per
cent profit in three years.
"To the mining speculator this will ap
pear at once as a splendid opportunity
lor the investment of capital, which dif
fers irom the ordinary mining specula
tion?, since the investor has an absolute
guarantee with security held in trust Dy
the Union Trust Company of this City
that all moneys invested will yield a net
profit of at least 100 per cent within three
years."

"Over the chain of lagoons in Chiapas,
where we hunted for ezrets," said C. H.
Freear at the International yesterday, one
of the four who have returned from that
country, "there is a curious plant or shrub
called the rnangley. It grows up vary
thickly, and when it has reached the
height of eigbt or ten feet the top tails and
i.ikes root again in the water. New shoots
come up and thus over a good part of the
water is an impenetrable tnicket. In or
der to get through the water boatmen had
taken their machetes and cut a passage or
estero, which when you enter looks like a
little and very long trellised arbor.
'â¢I have seen these a mile or more in
length, and when the tide comes in from
the sea, if you are in the harbor with a
boat you will have to look out. We passed
through many of tnese in our search for
the egrets, in going from one late to an
other through a chain of lagoons.
â¢â We shot nil our egrets from the boat,
as they flew overhead, and *c had to be
very quiet in eetting them after they fell,
or the alligators or sharks wou:d snap
them up. The lakes are alive with both
these animals, and the sharks are man
eaers as well as the alligator-. Any num
ber ot eerets that we shot we never got at
ail. Probably we wouldn't at the time see
an alligator or a shark, but it was there,
for no sooner would tho bird fall than a
nos 1 would come out of the water and
snatch it out of sight.
"because of the constant presence of
these animais and their boldness we had
to be constantly on the alert. A man's
life wasn't worth a cent if ne feli over

experiences when on a shallow lagoon by

Turning a Jrump in Duplicate
Whist.
In many of the leading whist clubs of the
country the question of declaring one suit
trumps during the entire play of a match or
contest on tne "compass" or "duplicate" plan
has become a leading one. Many of our most
enthusiastic players, tyros and experts alike, :
favor the idea of not turning a tru:np. Fisher ,
Ames of uoston, one of the best known ex
perts and writers on the game now living, in
a letter :o the executive committee, which
was read at the midwinter meeting at Nash
ville, advocates its adoption in the ieajjue.
While we were a euestoi N, B. Trist in New
Orleans a short time ago we asked his opinion
on this subject, and he stated for duplicate
whist it was a good idea. Theodore Shwarz,
ex-president of the American Whist League
and for tnree years president of the great
Chicago Wnist Club, has advocated this
change for a long time. Now John H. Briges
of Minneapolis, known throughout the whist
world as one of the greatest players living and
one whose judgment carries great weicrht, ir>
a recent article to the Minneapolis Times on
the subject, says:
For a long time all duplicate plar in the North
west was conducted without the ''trump card,"
clubs generally Dein? desiznated as the trump
suit. It was only recently that a change was made
to the turned trump. The first reason which sug
gested the advisability of a change was the im
portance of practice under the methods which
wonid be followed in the congress matches. Ii j
must be very evident that this was a good reason,
for if the turned trump neces Hated any changes ;
in the lias of p^ay it was very important that they I
should be Known. Again, as long as clubs was \
not to be trumrs, i: was well toget out of the habit
of thinking thai was th% trump. This may appear
very weak, but the following will show that the
force of habit is very strong: It was a very im- |
pori&nt match and the player had been in the |
habit of playing clubs for trump. A small card
which would hirdly attract thÂ« attention was
turned. The trump escaped his notice and be
played the entire deal thiukiDg that clubs were
trump*. To our knowledge the same thing has
happened many times.
The second reason for the change was a "request
order from Â»n oflicer of the league suggesting
that i' would be well to live up to the -'laws of
whist.'" It must be very evideiit that, this also
was a good reason for making the change.
It is now and has been for a long time the
opinion of many wbis era in this locality that the !
turned trump adds little If anything to the game
of duplicate whist. They are not exactly opposed
to the turned trump, but they prefer to play with
out it. They never have, so fÂ«r as I know, ad- j
vauced Mr. Ames' reasons of the "perfect equality [
of conditions " and "the true theory of duplicate
whist." etc. The reasons which they give are !
these: The turned trump adds practically nothing
to the game. It Is only once In a great while that
the line of i lay is affected by It so as to require
any particular Ingenuity in adapting oue'a self to
the changed conditions.
It is our opinion that it can be set down as a rule,
seldom to be broken, thnt the play should be the
name as it would have been bad not a tripm â  p been
turned. Occasionally the trump card will enable
the player to make a single card echo. Once in a
white it. will induce him to leal trumps which ha
â would not have done but for the iurned-up card.
More often it will make him desist from a trump
lead, rllher because he desires to catch the turned
card or because it on account of its size scares
him. It may apnear sfnnge, but it Is a fact, that
an honor turned is an object of fear to the average
whlst-player. Jt la for this reason productive of
much poor whist. Many good whisi-players when
F ron< lti irumps avoid a lead up to the honor and
make a play called "a cull through honor," to
secure a trump lead from partner.
It Is not our purpose to discuss mis play, bu' we
will state that it Is our conviction that more tricks
are lost than are gained by this play. Keeping
track of the trump card, even by the latest im
proved methods, and the mistakes wh.ch arise
therefrom are troubles harJly worth discussiag.
To sum up, the turned trump adds little or nothing
to the game, while on the other hand it leads the
majority of players into weak lines of play which
they overcome wl'.h the greatest difficulty. It
calls for the extra trouble of record cards which
often lead to mistakes. While the argument
against the trump card may not be very strong,
the argument in its favor Is no stronger, If any
thing not so strong.

ALAMEDA, May 10. 1897.
Whist Editor Call : Many of my friends, as
well as myself, feel we are indebted to Thk
Call for the good work your whist articles are
doing on this side of the bay. I also want to
tender you my sincere thanks for the unend
ing good you have done me, personally, and
our little whist circle. My husband loves to
play whist, and he, like all men, knows the
gnme thoroughly from A to Z In his own opin
ion. For a yenr or so before we were married
we used to play together night after night, I
as hu partner. We did fairly well, making
aferage scores; of course, I made all the mis
teke*, and aiways knew It when it was too
late, but how patient and considerate he was
of the boat. We have had the boat wabble
and shake till we thought the thing would
surely be upset. I remember once an old
alligator was prowling around so close
1 and casting such insinuating glances at
j me that I could stand it no longer ana
j blczed away with boih barrels of my "hot
gun at him. He was only a little way off
and the aim was all rijiht, but the gun
was loaded with birdshot and only
wounded nim. He set up a terrible
! thrashing and to banned and whacked the
I boat around by the impact of his tail in
, the water alongside that I was fearful he
i would smash the boat. I thought that
; was his object. If he had done that it
, would have been all day with us.
"That's the way they do. They steal
!up to the edee of a bank or lakeshore,
! where there may be a man or an animal,
' and with a powerful swish of their great
j tail knock their prey off in the water.
j There they've got everything their own
way. They simply tear their victim'with
their ereat jaws and eat. In this way
they capture thousands on thousands of
the little brown deer that inhabit that
part of Chiapas ana that come down to
the water to drink.
"They also swipe in many a thoughtless
tiger that also may come down to drink,
or to watch for a deer that may want a
drink. It is true the tigers are very sly,
like all animals of the cat kind, but even
these sometimes pay tribute to the am
phibians.
"Talking about these tieers, we saw
many of them. They are thick through
that country, and have slain thousands of
deer, the bodies and bones of which we
saw. They are of two kinds, one weigh
ing 250 to 300 pounds, and ihe other a little
thing, but beautifully mottled. The big
ones can put up a rattling tight. They
are dangerous if hungry or if you mix up
with their kittens in any way. A safe way
is to give them a pretty wide berth, unless
well armed. It is the same wav with the
tapirs, of which there are also a great
many. But these being herbivorous,
won't bother you if you keep out of the
way. But if you don't, you are liable to
get lifted on their hook-like nose aud
be given a vicious scrape with one of its
plantigrade feet. This hook on the top of
the nose is really a sharp horn, set up like
a huge tooth. With it the tapir can np
and tear any animal with which he may
come in contact. I saw a number of
them.
"We also saw many lyre birds und
paradise birds. The tails of the lyre birds
are set up in the shape of a lyre, and are
very beautiful, and the feathers of
the bird, like those of the egret, are ex
tremely valuable for millinery purposes.
The great bird ttiere, winch resembles the
turkey in this country and has meat like
a pheasant, is called the pysand by the
natives of Chiapas. It is a different bird
from the great pheasant, or causal, of
Guatemala, one of wtiich may be seen at
the children's play ground in Golden Gate
Park. That is a country of wonders.
Being tbere, too, as the first white men
who have ever visited it, we saw things in
all their natural and attractive wildness.
Of course, we would not have enjoyed the
trip so much, it is safe to say, had we not
eot the fifteen pounds and over of magnifi
cent egret feathers, worth as a whole about
$9000."
Those who went with Mr. Freear were
WHIST
then. A change came over him a few months
efter we wore married. My! toe tricks he
would charge me with losing; he would get
hot, fume, scold and kick; at times it was
almost unbearable. It seemed that every play
I made was wrong. He would say, "You
} ought to have Known I had the king," or the
! ace, or whatever it was, but I really didn't. I
often thought in my own mind that tho bad
play was not always on my side, for I know
the proper leads and follow*, second and third
hand play. The little I do know was taught
me by Miss \\ heelock. Stie also presented me
with a copy of "Cavendish," but my husband
used to laugh at me so for studying it I gave
it up while he was home. So fora longtime
: we, by mutual agreement, never have played
1 a game as partners. About two months ago
I the Owl Drue Company presented me with a
! copy of The Call's "Wnist Donts." After
| reading the little book i slipped it into my
; husbind'sinside pocket. A few nights ago we
j were invited over to a whist party, and he
J said, ''Nellie, let us play together to-night.
| What say you?" I felt a little "squeamish."
! We tilayed the whole evening and he never
once grumbled at me. He was just as he used
jto be before we were married. On the way
j home ho said to me, '-Nellie, did you put that
i copy of 'Whist Donts" in my pocket?'
| Writings of Nicholas BroWse Jrist.
We have been asked a great many times if
Mr. Trist has ever written a whist book. We
| sincerely regret to say that up to the present
time Mr. Trist has not favored the whist world
with any publication beariue his name. About
nine years ago Mr. Trist wrote a long series of
articles lor the Spirit of the South, a paper
published in New Orleansâ the home of Mr.
Trist. About five years ago he wrote another
series of article* for the Inter Ocean of Chi
cago. His occasional writings in the Field of
London, Harper's Weekly and Whist, together
with the others, would be a valuable collection
in book form. We nave all these carefully
preserved in our whist library, and some day
they will certainly appear in print.
Galling for Trumps folding Jfone.
Whist Editor Call : I would like to ask about
calling for trumpsâ if a piayer Is justified in
calling for them if be has none in his hand ?
This question came up at a whist luncheon
yesterday, and I propose to get ihe views of
experts on the matter. With cordial greeting
I am sincerely yours. E. R. M.
Rosemont, Perm.. May 2, 1897.
We would like to shirk the responsibility of
answering such a question, and would be very
glad to receive the opiuion of Miss Wheelock
on the subject. We will say, however, ihe
only conclusion we can possibly arrive at
h hen a player might think he would be justi
fied in calling for trumps, holding none him
self, would be overwhelming strength in all
the other plain suits. In order to "call" from
such a holding and put his partner in the lead
he would be obliged to play two low cards
without attempting to win the trick (barring a
prearranged one-card call), and this being the
case he would show at once that he did not
have overwhelming strength in all the other j
suits. If he did he would be foolish to pass j
two tricks that he might have won. We be-
I lieve when a player deliberately passes a trick
j that he could win he must be certain of taking
two for each one passed. We cannot see how
! he could expect to do this in a case like the
i above. The chance of thirteen trumps being
I divided among the other three players in such
a way that the partner of the caller could ex
haust them to brine in one long suit is so
highly improbable that we think no one but a
novice at the game would ever be foolish
enough to think such kind of play would be
trick-winning.

The RalÂ«ton System of Cooking Being
Introduced in San Francisco.
The preparation of food on hygienic
principles is a subject of interest to every
one. The Kalston method, a scientific
system of cooking, has just made its in
itial bow in San Francisco, the system
having been inaugurated by William E.
Alien, who has established one of the
most attractive restaurants in tho City at
I 315 and 317 Bush street.
The Ralston system of hygienic prepar
ation of food is quite popular in Eastern
cities and is growing in public favor all
the time. Every dish served at first-class
establishments will, however, be at the
command of patrons of the new restaurant
as well as trie Ralston specialties. A feature
of the week will be the Sunday dinner,
which will be prepared in most elaborate
style for 50 cents, with a bottle of tine
wine.
The appointments of the new restaurant
are complete in every detail, naving Deen
arranged with a view to comfort, and the
fixtures are neat and artistic. In order to
obtain a cook that was thoroughly versed
in the Ralston hygienic school of cooking
M rs. Allen brought a chef direct from the
EaÂ«t.
The culinary department has been ar
ranged on the most modern lines and em
braces all the appliances known to science
and mechanical skill in that line.
It is evident from the substantial sup
port that this new restaurant is receiving
in the way of patronage, which has
prompted the proprietor to keep open the
establishment until midnight, thai a sys
tem of hygienic cooking is what San
Franciscans have long desired, and the
enterprising and progressive spirit of the
Ralston's proprietor is meeting with de
served success. *

Stop to Think, but Don't Hesitate.
The following article is from the pen of L.
M. Bouve, whist editor of the Boston Tran
s6ript. This advice is good and will apply to
some of our tncal players:
After sorting the hand, before playing a card,
one should make up his mind as to the sir!" of
ranipaiKd be intends to conduct. A great many
players simply pick up their hand and. after a
cursory glance, lead from the loneeat suit, if be
lievers in that school, and others from whatever
hapi>ensto strilce thPir fancy, if followers of the
various other systems. With no definite scheme
they make a s"art and await developments. The
way to inspire partner with confidence and at the
pame lime to Impress opponents, is to play with a
distinct oijeet In view. It is not necessary to ;ry
to confuse opponents by banglug down the cards;
neither Is it essential to play fast; simply give
them to understand that you know whs t you are
about and propose to do your share in winning the

Milwaukee, Wis. , May 2, 1807.
Whist Editor Call: Your favor of the 26th to
hand. I accept your Idea of playing whist,
but I think it would take me a lifetime to play
as you suggest, at least I think I am too old
to master the game now. I can plainly see
the more I study it the better I play; one
trouble is, among my friends that play whist
I don't find one that is really a good player,
at least better than myself. In a play the
other evening the following hand was dealt.
Will you kindly tell me the card you would
select to lead? The hand was as follows:
Spadesâ s, 4, 3, 2.
HearUâ J. 9, G.
Cludsâ 7, 6, 3.
Diamondsâ A, J, 9.
Clubs were trumps. Yours, H. P. T.
Before we answer this question we will
say to our Milwaukee correspondent, don't
get discouraged ; the more you study the game
the more light you will throw upon it, and
your interest will grow deeper and deeper
as long as you live; particularly in after
years, when your eyes commence to grow dim,
ycu will find that you have prepared for your
self a happy and enjoyable old age.
II you will refer to pages 20 and 21 of Thk
Cali/s 'Whist Donts," which are sent free of
all expense, upon application, the lead from
such a holding is given. Ihe four-card suit Is
absolutely worthless, so drop it. Now you
have three three-card suits to select from.
Lead a card that will be easy for your partner
to read your probable holding. Our selection
would be the jnck of hearts.

LOBBYISTS.
An Effort in BTasHnchuaetts to Kestrain
Their Kvll Work.
The Massachusetts Senate has done the
proper thing in renewing the rale of last
year forbidding the presence of members
of the lobby upon the floor of thu Senate
chamber and in the rooms set apart for the
use of the Senators, and it has shown the
good sense to include "nil others" in this
prohibition ; for to put up the Dars against
the honest lobbyist, the man who frankly
declares himself as such anrt to permit the
mau who does his lobbying under the
rose to go where he pleases ana to talk
with members when he pleases is an
illogical as well as an inequitable course,
notwithstanding that It is in keeping with
the greater part of our anti-lobby legisla
tion. So far as it gee*, the Senate rule is
sensible and proper; the only improve
ment to it that occurs to us would be a
clause forbidding Senators from having
dealings with the members ot the tbira
bouse in places other than those speci
fied; but there might be difficulty in en
forcing such a provision.
Time was when an ex-member of the
Legislature had liberty to go almost any
where that pleased him, and, naturally,
therefore, the position of Representative or
Senator was regarded as an indispensable
preliminary course for the school of lob
byist. In those days members of the lobby,
by virtue of their former service In the
Legislature, moved about among mem
bers of the House, eveu to the extent of
sitting in a member's seat and instructing
another member how he should or should
not vote, and in the Senate the lobbyist
had but to beclton to the average Senator
to come to the rail and he came. Now no
body not a member of the Legislature or
in some way connected with it can enter
upon the floor of either branch without
invitation, which is in the nature of an
indorsement of the visitor's disinterested
motive*. This is an immense improve
ment over the old situation, and perhaps
not the lean of the good results growing
out of it is a distinct falling off in the
class of men who considered membership
in the Senate or House merely as a step
ping-stone to the lobby.
But the law requiring lobbyists or
"legislative agent*' 1 to register draws
after it the consequence of giving to the
member ot the third house a standing and
a recognition which he did not previously
possess. Furthermore, it places restric
tions upon the registered lobbyist â that is
to say, the lobbyist who obeys the law â
while the lobbyist who denes the law is
left free to pi v his vocation without let or
hindrance. Then the law does not reach
the most dangerous of the lobbyistsâ the
men who seldom ox never go to the State
House, but who do their work at the
hotels or in their private law offices.
There is a deal of flummery in the talk
one hears about the wicked lobbyist, and
very little stress is put upon the wicked
ness of the leeislator who is in cahoot
with the lobbyist. It is absurd to speak
of the corrupting influences of the lobby,
unless it be admitted there are in the Legis
lature men who are corruptible. We hold
that any man or woman in Massachusetts
has the right to go up to the State House
to argu* with any and ail members of the
Legislature who will listen to his or her
argument? ; but we nlso hold that the leg
islators have the right, and should innist
upon it, that their privacy shall not be in
truded upon either in the legislative cham
bers or in ihe reading and smoking rooms.
It seems to us that the rule which pre
vents this intrusion is all the legislation
in regard to the lobby that is needed.â

tubes, the ends of which extend to the
interior of the shoe to ventilate it.
Revolving disk cutters are used in a
new lawnmower, the teeth being mounted
on a flat wheel, inclosed in a guard casing

the forks to meet each other tbrough the
spokes of the wheel, where they are
locked.

THE WASHINGTON STATUE.
It is appropriate that the noblest monu
ment to Washington outside the capital
of the Nation should, stand in Philadel
phia, and owe its erection to the patriot
ism of the order of the Cincinnati. While
Virginia claims Washington as her own
by reason ' of his ; birth and continuous
residence within her limit*, his lilÂ» during
the period when it was greatest and most
influential is more intimately associated
with Philadelphia than with any other
locality in the Union. >
It was at the city of Philadelphia that
the Congress of the colonies met, and
after proclaiming their independence ap
pointed George Washington to take com
mand of the army. ' It was near that city
that he guarded the cause of i freedom in
his camp at Valley Forge during the dark
est hours of the Revolution. For a
time, moreover, it was the capital of
the newly founded Republic. Around
Philadelphia, therefore, cluster more pat
riotic associations with Washington than
around any other of our cities. It was
there he began his great career, and it was
there that he showed forth most clearly
the grandeur of bis soul.
Another fact which makes ihe place an
appropriate one for a special commemo
ration of Washington is the character of
the city itself. As Washington is regarded
as the typical American, so is Philadel
phia everywhere looked upon as the typi
cal American city. While it is neither the
largest, the richest nor the most progres
sive community in America, it is, never
theless, the one which has most fully
realized the American conception of civic
life.
It is the city of homes, a well-ordered
community where the virtues of right liv
ing are more honored than wealth, where
a greater proportion of the people own
the houses they live in than in any other
large city in the world, and where Ameri
can ideals have been more tally accom
plished than in any other of our large
communities. It is altogether right that
the first and the greatest of Americans
should be most highly honored in a city
that is most truly American.
From accounts which have been given
of it the monument which Philadelphia
dedicated yesterday is the most artistic
statuesque structure which has thus far
been raised in America. It serves as the
standard of our accomplishments of the
kind. In its superiority over other under
takings of a similar nature it marks the
extent to which we have advanced in our
artistic development and affords a high
level of attainment from which to make
the departure for further progress and
higher excellence in the future.
The order of the Cincinnati has proven
its usefulness to the community by rais
ing. this nob monument, and it is to be
hoped that it will continue in the self
appointed task of stimulating the patri
otism and the virtue of the people by re
calling to the puolic mind the virtues of
the great patriots who founded the order
and with whose fame it is inseparably
associated. We can never have too many
memorials of our National heroes, and it is
I gratifying to know that our taste in such
matters is rapidly being raided to true
standards of excellence. The Washington
monument will serve the double purpose
of reviving the memory of the founder of
the Republic and of stimulating the
aitistic education of the people, and will
i serve not only as an ornament to Phila
delphia but as a benefit to the country at
large. â  â  " ' ' ' '
CANNONS AND CLOUDS.
A n A ustrian grape-grower lias succeeded
in driving away hailstorms by establish
ing a cordon of mortar batteries round his
vineyards and tiring them off when the
clouds threaten. This is a reversal of the
process tried a few years ago in this coun
try, when there was a great waste of noise
and money in the attempt to cause rain
fall by means of detonations. Our exper
iment was regarded as a farce by scientific
men, who announced its absurdity from
the start, but even the scientists never
told us that in discharging bombs to pro
duce rain we were dispelling the clouds
that brinjj it.
The story from Austria might be consid
ered by the skeptically inclined as a hoax
nad it not come in the shape of a report
to the State Department from the United
States Consul at Annaberg. Consul
Stephan says that the Austrian who
made the experiment owns extensive vine
yards on the southern slope* of moun
tains in a locality where hailstorms aro
frequent and very destructive. He erected
six batteries on mountain summits com
manding about two mileb of territory.
When the threatening black clouds appear
the mortars are tired off and the clouds
rise, scatter and disappear. The experi
ment was tried successfully six times, and
there was not a single failure.
No one in this country, when detona
tions proved ineffective in bringing rain,
suspected that the reversal of the experi
ment would be brilliantly successful and
that the artillery of earth could frighten
away the artillery of the heavens. It will
be a glorious consummation of peace when
the nations can find use for their gunners
in defeating the destructive rage of the
elements instead of destroying each other.
However, it can safely be predicted that
America will be shy about trying any
more experiments in that line. We will
let the Austrians have a monopoly of
artillery duels with the hail clouds until
science fully indorses that system of grape
protection. _______________
A PUZZLER.
Pcr -oils who take an interest in puzzles
and tind delight in exercising their brains
in the work of guessing conundrums or
solving a rebus will find a pleasant em
ployment, and pernaps a profitable one,
at this time in studying out the sugar
schedule of the tariff bill as revised by
the Senate, comparing it with schedules
on the same subject in the Dingley bill
and the existing law and determining
which of the three gives the greater protec
tion to tne sugar industry. The question
is sorely puzzling all the experts of the
country, and while many claim to have
solved it no two of them agree in the solu
tion.
The New York Tribune figures it out
that while the Wilson tariff gives a benefit
to the si- ;ar reiiners of 365-1000 of a cent
per pound at present prices the Dingley
bill gives a difference of an eighth, with
some further incidental benefit, and the
Senate bill gives an advantage of half a
cent. The New York Times estimates that
the cost of 100 pounds imported refined
sugar is now 32.5 cents higher on account
of the duty, while under the Dingley bill,
it says, * the difference would be 21
cents, and under the Aldrich bill 64 cents.
Henry D. "Woolfe is quoted by the
Examiner as e&timaiing that under the
Wilson bill the renner receives a
benetit of $1% cents per 100 pounds,
and that under the bill reported
by the Senate he will receive 88%
cents. The expert of the New York
Press, on the other hand, seems to have
reached the conclusion ; that i the > sugar
growers will receive no benefit at all from
the Senate , bill, for he says, "The ad
valorem duty will ; â¢wjimp them wUfe

sugars, not of Hawaii alone, but of the
eighteen countries which grow the sugar
of the world."
Robert P. Porter, who has had .some ex
perience in making tariff?, admits that
the sugar schedule as reported by tiie
Senate committee is a mystery to him,
but he adds that we have the word of such
eminent statesmen as Senators Allison
-anti Aldrich that the proposed sugar
schedule does not favor the refining in
terests any more than the Dink-ley bill.
The opinions of Allison and Aldrich are
certainly entitled to have great weight
with the public, since they are recognized
as the ablest tariff experts now in public
life.
It is reported that ex-Governor Wnr
moth of Louisiana, who is one of the
greatest sugar-producers in the world, re
cently declared : "The sugar schedule is so
badly mixed, so complicated, that to my
simple farmer mind it is all a riddle. In
order to understand just what it mean?, 1
intend to employ an expert on tariff ques
tions, especially as they relate to sugar,
and see whether he can unravel the tan
gle." It is to be hoped the ex-Governor
will make public the report of his expert.
We have had so many expert opinions on
this subject that one more is all that, is
needed to turn the Dicnic into a circus.
When the bill is taken up in the Senate
for debate Senators Allison and Aldrich
will explain it. Until then it remains a
pleasant subject for discussion among
people who delight in puzzles.
VOCATIONS FOR INDIANS.
The coming disbandment on the last
day of this month of the Indian soldiers
stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, is an ex
pression of the Government's deliberate
judgment that the red men do not make
good soldiers. While this will be a dis
appointment to the friends of that race,
and of humanity in general, it is offset by
the announcement of the wonderful suc
cess that has attended the trusting of In
dians in the duties of police officers and
police judges.
The two items of news taken together
furnish a strong argument for persistent
efforts in trying to improve the race, since
they show that though failure may at
tend many attempts at finding vocations
at which the remnants of the savage race
can be both useful and contented they
should not be turned down as incorrigible
and worthless. By searching there niay
be other avenues discovered in which they
can serve society profitably.
It was hoped that Indians would be
found valuable soldiers because of their
love of fighting, their capacity for en
durance, and tiieir indifference to discom
forts. The test has shown, however, that
they cannot bear the severe discipline and
the routine duties of the regular soldier's
life. It seems to their minds a most irk
some inaienity 1o be ordered to go to bed
at a certain hour. They grow weary of
having to salute every man that happens
to wear a shoulder-strap, of standing
around continuously looking neat, and of
doing seemingly useless things with
alacrity. Insubordination follows these
feelings, and makes the braves unlit for
Uncle Sam's service according to estab
lished regulations. They are good war
riors by spurts and spells, but they re
quire more relaxation and freedon from
restraint than the civilized camp allow?.
In serving as police, on the other hand,
they have pioved themselves to possess
in a remarkable degree the combination
of diligence, courage and incorruptibility
which makes them exceedingly service
able in that capacity. When they cap
ture aii offender they are sure to brini;
him in for trial, as neither threats nor
bribery will turn them from the faithful
performance of their ofiice. It has been
found that at the call of their regular
duties they will ac: against their own race
without fear or favor. The sense of
authority pleases them, and they like the
work.
Some of the chiefs who fought most
fiercely against the whites are now doing
polics duty in the most trustworthy way
for a very small wage. One of tne most
notorious of these is Rain-in-the-Face,
who is credited witti killing lorn Custer,
the brother of General Custer. Chief Gall,
who also was a leader in the Custer mas
sacre, has done excellent work as a Police
Judge at Standing Rock, S. D., ana John
Grass, in the same capacity, has rendered
decisions which it is said would do credit
to Solomon.
If such transformations can take place
in individual lives among the most savage
leaders of the savage, then surely very
much may be hoped when civilized en
vironment has bacl several generations to
perfect its work.
THE ENRAGED TURK.
.Reports from Europe show that while it
was comparatively easy for the Emperors
of Russia, Germany and Austria to incite
the Sultan to war it is by no means so
easy for them to stay his band now that
war has begun and bis armies are flushed
with victory. The Sultan himself, it
seems, is borne forward by the aroused
spirit of his people ana could not stop
them if he would. The Turk is enraged,
and in his rage is regardless of everything
except the passion and the iury ot battle.
Upon the men wbo turned loose the
dogs of war in Turkey rests the responsi
bility of t lie present dangers to all Europe.
They should have foreseen that when the
Turkish people bad once entered upon a
war and attained success in it they would
be as har<i to control as wild beasts, and
that nothing but force could compel them
to release the prey which they had seized.
If the statesmen who urged on the Sultan
did not foresee this they are among the
blindest that ever led the blind into dan
ger, and if they did foresee it and have
not guarded against it then the world can
have as little respect for their humanity
as on the other hand it could have nad for
their wisdom.
When the alliance of the three Emper
ors was announced their diplomatists
spoke boldly of its proposed policy. They
declared in strong terms it would notonly
keep the peace and maintain the existing
situation in Europe, but would dictate
terms in South Africa and set bounds
there upon the limits of the British em
pire. This alliance, which so short a time
ago was proudly boasting its ability to act
as the arbiter of the world, now finds itself
powerless to keep the peace even within
the narrow confines of the Levant.
In the present situation few statesmen
care to venture upon making predictions
as to the result. It is known that the
people of England, France and Italy are
so strong in their sympathy for Greece
they will never consent to permit the
Turks to annihilate that kingdom or even
to greatly weaken it. The new Holy Alli
ance therefore will have to deal with
Western Europe as well as with the
enraged Turk. It may be possible for
them to maintain the peace by a show of
force, but the probabilities are against
them, and it would not be surprising if
they should fall out with one another in
attempting to devise a plan for extricat
ing themselves from the difficulties in
which they are involved.
To have settled the Cretan question
with thnt which they now have on hand,
of satisfying Western Europe without pro
voking the maddened Turks to some act
of rage which will involve them all in war.
TEE DEFENSE OF LONDON
What Paris is to France London is to the
British empire. To realize this we have only
to imagine what the empire would be without
London. Paris has often been the ultimate
objective of invading armies, for the fall oi
that capital means, practically speaking.'the
subjugation of the country.
In a strongly centralized Government an at
tack on the capital is an attack at a most vital
point, and usually its capture puts an end to
effective opposition and ends the war.
Although the Government of England is
much less centralized than that of France, and
the capture of London might not terminate
the war, still as it is the acknowledged tinan
cial and commercial center of the world, such
a catastrophe could not fail to have the most
momentous and far-reaching consequences.
This enormous aggregation of wealth and in
dustrial enterprise, the very center of civiliza
lion, would be a most tempting prize for an
invading army, to say nothing of the political
results which would follow its capture.
While most of the European capitals have
nithin the past twenty years been gradually
converted into so many immense fortresses,
provided with distant outworks to give secu
rity against bombardment and with internal
arrangements for supplying and maneuvering
armies, England bas been content to leave
London entirely unprotected.
The reasons for this seeming apathy are not
far to seek. The events of the Napoleonic
wars are not yet forgotten, nor bow the plans
of the Emperor for the invasion of England
were defeated by the British navy. To attack
London an invading army is required, and
this in turn depends on holding command of
the sea, at least for a certain period.
Therefore, as long as England's position
at sea remains unassailable there seems but
little danger of an attack on London. Many
military students hold that the true defense
of London lies with the navy, and that with
tno navy once defeated fortifications
would not suffice to stop the in
vaders. England's policy is therefore to be
able to hold the sea against any power
or combination of powers. Owing to this
.supremacy at sea she is not only a great
naval and commercial power, but a great
military power as well. By means of the eea
her forces are multiplied as it were and can be
a; once brought to bear upon the most threat
ened point. With her iusular position and
invulnerability to ordinary attack it is not
surprising that England should have so long
neglected these matiers of internal defense
and organization on which the Continental
powers have concentrated so much thought
and spent such fabulous sums oi money.
Of lafe years, however, British self-confi
dence hag been somewhat shaken, and the
project of fortifying London, or rather of or
ganizing its defense, has received a I a rice share
of attention. It has been pointed out that if
it should so happen that the English home
fleet were overpowered tit the beginning
of a war with a first â¢ class Conti
nental power, such as Uermanv, an
invasion by a well-equippert and well-organ
ized army would be almost certain to follow.
Can England be whipoed at sea? In peace
times the navy is necessarilr much scattered
and a considerable time would be required to
mobilize n sufficient fleet for home de
fense. With a sudden declaration of
war it is quite withiu the range
oi possibilities that a way might lie opened
for an attempt on London. It is probable
that such an invading force would be supe
rior to any England could assemble at short
notice, and by making a rnpid march on Lon
don its capture would be reasonably certain.
Such an operation would be a raid on a grand
scale, and whtle the risk involved would be
great, the prospect of thus ending the war by
a sudden and brilliant coup is so templing
that it would probably be attempted.
It is precisely this danger which makes some
sort of a land defense for the city a necessity.
The invading force would travel light and
must be met in front and detained long
enough for an organized resistance to be
made. If possible while so detained it ivouid
be surrounded and .put off entirely. But if
the force once gains possession of London it
would furnish a base for further operations,
anu if held would mean the termination of
tne war. Th 9 very suddenness of modern war
and the completeness of preparation of the
Continental nations all increase the probabil
ity of such an attempt being made.
Tne main principles which should govern in
the defense 01 ix>ndon were decided upon ten
years ago by the most eminent soldiers in
England. It was concluded that the city
"must be surrouuded by defensive positions,
strongly held and fortilied with artillery as a
second line of defense." This wort has been
going on now for some years. In the
main the scheme adopted is that developed
by the eminent military writer, the late Gen
eral Sir Edward Hamley, In a volume entitled
â¢'National Defense," published in 1889. The
leading idea is similar to that underlying the
project of Moltke's, drawn up in 18(J0, for the
defense of Prussia against Austria. Instead of
fortifying Berlin directly he preferred the pre
paration ol a line at some distance south of
the city, so that it could be held for a short
time by even a comparatively weals corps.
As London can be approached either from
the south or northeast there are to be two pro
posed linesâ one running from Tilbury to Ep
ping, the other on the south, following the
general line of the North Downs.
To defend these positions a force of some
(30,000 men ii required, and some 120
volunteer brigades have been assigned to the
work and 233 guns. It is calculated that if
an efficient volunteer corps and a proper or
ganization can be had there would be no
difficulty in placing 60,000 men in position
by the morning of the fourth day from the
time mobilization wan ordered.
It remains to be *<â¢ >n whether such a force
can hold its own against a compact, well
commanded army of regulars. Lines such as
those described can be made very formid
able in a short time and under com
petent engineers can often replace to ad
vantage, the more expensive and perma
nent forms of fortification. The question
will be largely as to the efficieucy of
the men nehind the works. In respect of
prepara ion for war Kaglaud is in much the
same category as the United States. Imminent
danger of war and invasion forms the force
by which the Continental armies are kept in
such a constant state of readiness, and It is
altogether probable that until the necessity is
brought home to her England will be to a
great extent unprepared for n. war of any mag
nitude.

POWER WIELDED BY THE SECRET POLITICAL SOCIE
TIES OF THE OLD WORLD.
Of all the factors in Ola World politics
there are none that are more potent and
important than the secret societies by
whicli Europe, Asia and Africa are honey
combed. Relatively, ittle is known con
cernine them, but the solution of the
present crisis in the Levant may be said
to depend entirely uDon the wishes of the
unknown leaders of one of these organi
zations, who alone can determine whether
by the time this article appears in print
King George will still be on his tottering
throne or an exile from the land over
which he has reignedâ but hardly ruledâ
for the last lour and thirty years.
For monarch, cabinet, assembly and
army of Greece ure all subject to the des
potism of the Kthnike Hetaria, the chief
of which is generally believed to reside at
Alexandria, while some of its principal
leaders have been established for years
here in the United States. It is this
society that has compelled King George
to invade Turkish territory in Crete with
out any previous declaration of war
against the Sublime Porte, an act which
from the point of view of international
law is fully a? unjustifiable as the much
decried Transvaal raid; and it is the same
association that precipitated the trouble on
the northern frontier of Greece when every
nerve was being strained, not only by the
great powers, but also by the Sultan and
by King Gebrge himself, to avert hostili
ties and to bring about a pacific settle
ment of the trouble. Moreover, the popu
lar feeling at Athens against the Crown
Prince or "DiadoKus" is mainly due to the
reluctance which he manifested in obey
ing the behests of the society to assume
the offensive and hasten the attack upon
the forces under Edhem Pasha â a reluct
ance, which was in no wise attributable to
cowaidice aa has been asserted, but solely
to the pressing remonstrances on the part
of his foreign relatives, to allow them time
to secure a corunromise in every respect
honorable and satisfactory to Greece.
Not only the major portion of the rank
and file, but likewise the greater part of
the corps of officers of the Greek army, are
affiliated to tne Hetaria, and, knowing
the wishes and commands of the society,
they naturally rebelled against being kept
back by ihe Ciown Prince, and vented
their anger by charging him with lacking
courage, an imputation which tney com- |
municated to the 1 foreign newspaper cor
respondents on the spot. Discipline is not
the strong point of the Greeks, who are the
most passionate, unruly and, above all,
democratic people of Europe, and the
officers and men of the regular army
ended by joining in large numbers the
guerrillas, who on their own account
were making raids into Turkish territory.
This was of course more than the Sultan
could stand. He was prepared to abstain
from treating acts of overt hostility on
the part of the irregulars as a casus belli,
and to look upon their forays across Las '
frontier as mere pieces of brigandage by
irresponsible banditti. But the moment
that oflicers and soldiers of the regular
Greek army, in full uniform, took part in
the raids the latter assumed quite a dif
ferent aspect, and Edhem Pasha received
orders from Constantinople to assume the
offensive and to march upon the Crown
Prince.
The disasters which have ensued are
wrongly laid at the door of Coustantine.
The Turkish army, in spite of all that has
been said to the contrary, is ono of the
finest in the world, the men being abso
lutely indifferent to the danger of death,
so much so, indeed, that when wounded
they prefer to die of their injuries sooner
than have their lives saved by means of
amputations, which, according to their
ethics and religious convictions, are cal
culated to impair their chances of eternal
bliss hereafter, since the Houris of Para
dise will naturally prefer a man who is
complete to one who is deticient in the
normal quantity of arms and legs. The
Turkish army held even the splendidly
trained forces of Russia in check through
the entire winter of 1877, although the
Muscovite troops were vastly su
perior in numbers, and grandly led
by such celebrated generals as Gourko,
Skobeleff aiid Todleben. It was therefore
only to be expected that the Turks should
easily hold their own against the Greek
army, which was from the outset of the
struggle inferior in numbers, in equip
ment and in armament.
It is clear that as soon as the moving
spirits of the Hetaria realized that the
Greek army would be able to make no
definite stand against the Turkish invad
ers, they decided to withdraw frcm
the game, and to await a more propitious
opporturnity for attaining the aims which
they had in view, being particularly dis
appointed at the failure of their under
taking to precipitate a general European
war, from which they had expected to
reap golden results. This is evident from
their neglect to play a number of very
valuable cards which they held in their
hands, and which they would certainly
have placed on the table had they seen
any chance of winning the game. Thus
the European provinces of Turkey,
as well as Servia, Bulgaria, and even Clou
mania, literally swarm with Greeks nearly
nil affiliated to the Hetaria, and ready to
rise at a moment's notice on receiving the
word. This word was never given, nor
was any endeavor made by the Hetaria to
avail itself of the services of the several
hundred thousand of its members, who
reside at Constantinople and who are
scattered throughout the various cities
and seaports of Asia Minor. At Vienna,
at Paris, Frankfort ana London some of
the leading financiers are Greeks belong
ing to the Hetaria, who had they been
commanded might have worked wonders,
not only by means of tbeii local influence,
but also with their purse. Yet not a sign
was given to them that their assistance
was required. In the opinion of the
Hetaria it would have been a useless waste
of excellent material which might bs
found far more serviceable on another
occasion.
It being held necessary to secure some
one to bear the brant of the failure of the
enterprise and of the popular odium that
followed from the reverses sustained
around Larissa, the Hetaria pitched upon
the Grown Prince and branded him as a
coward for iot having assumed the offen
sire lrom the very outset, and likewise
abused the King for entrusting the army
to inadequate leadership. Whether the
society in question decides to keep the
present dynasty on the throne, or to over
turn it, remains to be seen. It will
doubtless depend to a great extent upon
the state of public feeling, and be deter
mined by the question as to whether the
people Htand in need of a scapegoat for
the entire affair.
It would be useless to wast* any undue
sympathy on King George if the Hetarla
decides to turn hi m out. : For he bus never
really considered himself any thing also
than a bird 01 passage at Athens, regard
ing Copenhagen^ as his real home, and it
is there that he has built a magninceut
palace, where all his art treasures and do
mestic belongings have been stored.
Moreover, he has managed while at
AlUenis to win. aa enormous fortune, lit
went there thirty-four years ago with
scarcely a cent in his pocket, his family
being so poor that his sisters, the present
Dowager Empress of Russia, the
Princess of Wales and the Duchess
of Cuttbarland, were forced through
motives of economy to make their own
hat* and frocks. To-day he is admittedly one
of the wealthiest sovereigns of Europe, and in
asmuch as his fortune has certainly not been
saved out of hi 3 civil list, which is so small
that during the first twenty years of his reign
the great powers were induced, in a sheer
spirit of commiseration, to contribute $100,
--000 more to his Greek annual stipend, it nat
urally follows that there must be some tru.h
in the stories current at Athens, according to
which King George made millions by specula
tion in American wheat in conjunction with
the late General Meredith Read, at the time
when the Turko-Russian war of 1870-77 had
tbe effect of closing both the port, and the
grain markets of Odessa. King George, like
his brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark,
is an extraordinarily fortunate speculator,
differing therein from Kin* Leopold of Bel
gium, King Oscar of Sweden, the French
royal Duke of Chartres and other stock-Job
bing monarchs and princes of the blood. So
that if George, wnose real baptismal name is
William, is forced by the Hetaria to follow the
example of his predecessor, King Otho, and to
abandon the Grecian throne, he may be con
i gratulated rather than pitied, since he will be
able to at length retire without any compunc
tion to his native country to spend the re
mainder of his days among people who
are infinitely more congenial to him than the
Greeks, and in the enjoyment of a fortune that
is simply colossal. Nor /rill there be any in
clination on the pan of the European courts
to blame him personally for the present trou
ble. He has repeatedly been on the point of
abdicating, and ou each occasion has re
mained at the urgent request of the great
powers, who were anxious at all costs to avoid
the complications which they knew would
ensue were his throne to become vacant.
Moreover, the European sovereigns are fully
aware that when he invaded Crete he had to
choose between doing so and facing a revolu
tion, instigated by the Hetaria, which wou'.d
have driven him from Athens, and that it he
id not lay down his crown then and there it
was entirely on account of the entreaties of
the foreign governments, who hoped that they
would be able to effect a compromise and â 
only re quired time in order to accomplish it.
The He-arii". is about 100 years old, consists
of a number of inner circles, and of wheels
within wheels, no one save a favored few
knowing who is the head thereof for the time
being. Like the society of the Carbonari in
Italy, and like that of the Mhllists in Russia,
it has had princes of the blood, and even
crowned monarchs, who have been affiliated
theroto. For it is well kriown that Emperor
Alexander I of Russia, was in the early part of
the present century a member of the Hetaria,
which showed itself so exacting that he pre
ferred to abandon his throne to bis brother
Nicolas, organizing a mock funeral, causing
his death to be proclaimed, and then retired
to the monastery of St. fc'ergius, where he sur
vived until 1864.
Napoleon 111 remained throughout his
reign submissively subject to the grand mas
ter of the Italian order of Carbonari, which he
joined while residing with his mother at
Rome. When Napoleon became Emperor he
at first imagined himself to be powerful
enough to bo able to afford to turn a deaf ear
to the commands of the Carbonari and to be
in a position to sever all further intercourse
with tnem. But they had not tbe slightest
intention of permitting him to become thus
unfaithful to his vows of fealty to the order,
and after they had instigated several
attempts to assassinate him (one of which,
known as the Orsini bomb outrage, resulted in
the death of a large number of bystanders
and in the destruction of the imperial equi
page on its way to the opera at Paris) he aban
doned all further idea of resistance. . He
readily obeyed when he received orders from
Rome to declare the preposterous war of 1859
against Austria, which, while it profited Italy
a great deal, brought France little or nothing
except the ill will of Austria, who would
otherwise have come to her rescue in 1870.
In 1806 again Emperor Napoleon took ad
vantage of the struggle between Austria and
Prussia to demand from the latter territorial
compensation along the Rhine, threatening
otherwise to march to the assistance of Aus
tria, which had just inflicted a crushing de
feat upon the Italians at Custozza. Bismarck
was on the point of yielding to the demands
of Napoleon, the Prussian defeat of Austria
having been a very close affair, which had left
the victor in a sadly weakened condition. But
suddenly the demands of France were with
drawn, and Napoleon contented himself with
requesting that the surrender of Venice by
Austria to Italy, which Prussia had insisted
on, should be made to him. Only after Napo
leon's death did people become aware that
his inexplicable withdrawal of demands which
were about to be conceded to the advantage
of France was solely due to the threats and
commands which had reached him from his
Carbonari associates in Italy. Indeed much
that is otherwise incomprehensible in the
eighteen years' reign of Napoleon, who was a
man of remarkable cleverness, becomes clear
as day when it is pointed out that he was
constantly forced by the Italian Carbonari
to embark upon enterprises and to adopt
measures disadvantageous in every respect to
France, but calculated to benefit Italy.
In Russia the Grand Duke Nicholas Con
stQiitinovich, who was banished to Siberia for
stealing his mother's jewels and the sacra
mental gems of the Imperial chapel at St.
Petersburg in order to present them to an
American adventuress, a Mrs. Hattie Black
ford of Philadelphia, was on the point of
being pardoned and rehabilitated in 1885
when the fact was suddenly brought to light
that he was affiliated to the Nihilist society
and that he had actually married
a female nihilist, a daughter of the
postmaster of Tashkend, wno was one
of the leaders of the movement The result
was that instead of being set at liberty be was
sentenced to close detention for the remainder
of his life. His father, the immensely clever
Grand Duke Constantine, was likewise Impli
cated in the nihilist movement. But that
was during the lifetime of his chivalrous
brother, Alexander IX The latter on receiv
ing from the Chief of Police the documentary
proofs of the guilt of his brother handed them
to him, and embracing him affectionately ex
claimed, "I do not beiievc in them, Constan
tine."
Moreover one should never forget that had
it not been for this secret society, known as
the nihilist, Russia would to-day be enjoying
the inestimable benefits of a full-fledged con
stitution and of a popular form of govern
ment, similar to that of the other civil
ized nations 01 the world, for the ukase
conferring these concessions upon the people
was already drawn up, had been signed by vie
Chancellor and Ministers, had been stamped
with the imperial seal and was about to re
ceive the final signature of the Czar, which
was all that was needed to convert the decree
into the law of the land, when on the very
morning of the day that he was to have put
his name thereto he was struck down and
blown to pieces in the streets of Bt. Petersburg
by the glycerine bombs of the nihilists.
In Austria there are at lea-t a dozen of these
secret societies, which seriously hamper the
action of tne Government and its policy, the
best known being probably the "Omladina,"
in Bohemia, and the "Italian Irredenta" of
the southern provinces. It was a member of
the former who attempted about three years
ago to wreck the train on which the Emperor
of Austiia was traveling to Prague, while
men affiliated with tho "Italia Irreden
ta," which is extensively represented in
Italy, are responsible for at least two
out ni the four attempts made upon the life
of King Humbert, the last one being the
work of a native of Artena, which is re
nowned throughout Europe as quite the most
wicked spot on the fnce of the globe, a reputa
tion which has been enjoyed for no less than
eight centuries. In India the action of the
British authorities was fora longtime para
lyzed by the secret society ol thugs, which was
finally suppressed mainly through the clev
erness and enmity of tho gallant one-armed
officer who now commands the London police.
The English bad equal troub.o with Dacoits

the Chinese empire has almost been rout in

secret societies, which abound in what is
known as "the Middle Kingdom." They are
all the more powerful for being occult, and
play so important a role in contemporary poli
tics that it is just as well In this manner to

A HISTORY OK THE HitOWTH OF THE
f-TKAM VFSSKI.- OF WAll IS THE
UNITKD STATES NAVY AND OF THE
â  NAVAL h,NMMcKB COUPS â By Frank M.
Bennett, packed assistant enelneer, U. S. S.
I'tustiorg: V"^' a "* 11 â¢Â£ Co, publishers.
Clark Basse!! has cast almost as bright a
halo of romance about the career ot the mer
chant sailor as Michael Scott did around the
life of the young English naval officer when
he gave to the world "Tom Cringle's Log" and
"The Cruise of the Midge." But the novelist
has yet to come who will lingo with idealism
the story of the lieutenant who walks the
deck or pushes the button on the bridge of the
floating fighting machine of to-day. It the
writer of fiction is wanting to hcroize the man
who makes his home in the modern iron
clad, one branch of the naval profession may
well feel proud of a champion who has en
tered the list in their behalf.
In his "History of the Steam Navy of the
United States," Frank M. Bennett, passed as
sistant engineer, U. S. X.. has given us a work
as interesting as a n vel and as instructive as
a faithful chronicle should be.
It was in this country that the first rteam
vessel for war purposes was built, and it is
fitting that the story of the development of
steam engineering should be told by an Ameri
can engineer. It is in our navy that this de
velopment has been most marked, and although
over three-quarters of a century has elapsed
ince the launching of the clumsy Demoleos
to the completion of the swift-sailing and
powerful lowa, not a decade has gone by that
has not witnessed some step forward.
The popular idea Is that the engineer deals
only with material things; that he takes no
part in the glorious possibilities of war. The
engineer, like the British soldier in Napier's
famous comparison, though fighting patiently
and we.l could look forward to no honors to
reward his daring: "his life of danger and
hardship was uncheered by hope, his death
unnoticed," while Napoleon's troops "fought
in bright fields, where every helmet caught
Borne gleams of gloi y."
The assertion of Mr. Bennett cannot be gain
said that a much firmer and finer degree of
courage is required in the officer who com
mands a division of men imprisoned beneath
the battle-hatches of a war steamer than in
fciru whose followers are in the open air and
in sight of their danger. While Mr. Bennett
hits pfliJ a iiting tribute to the courage and
fidelity of .he engineer corps and made evi
dent the justice of its claim for equal rank
with the line, he has done more. He has
jrivt-n us a history of tne navy since 1840 that
in some respects is superior to any heretofore
published. Ol especial value to (hose inter
ested in naval matters is the care with which
the author has traced the careers of the vari
ous steam vessels from the day they left the
builder's hands until the endâ sometimes
t-wallowed up by old ocean, oftener relegated
to the scrap pile.
Beginning with an account of the planning
and construction of the Demolgos by RoDert |
Fulton in 1814, we are giveu in a work of 900 '
pages what is apparently an exhaustive his
tory of the steam navy of the United State*.
Had Fulton's craft been completed in the time
expected there is no doubt but she would have
cleared oar seacoast of the British fleet and
anticipated in a way the revolution in naval
warfare achieved by the Merrimac-Moni
tor incident nearly sixty years later. The sud
den death of Fulton and otheruntoward events,
however, delayed the completion of the vessel
until peace was declared. The Demolgos was
afterward named the Fulton. She was taken
to Brooklyn navy-yard, where she was used as
areceiyingshipun.il 1829, when one day in
June her magazine exploded, completely de
stroying the vessel, killing twenty-font
persons and wounding nineteen. This
was the inglorious end of the first
Fteam war vessel ever built. It was
not till 1837 that another steamer was
added to our navy. This was also named the
Fa. ton. She was of 1200 tons displacement
and 180 feet long. She was commanded by
Captain M. C. Perry, afterward the commodore
who opened the ports of Japan to our com
merce. It was owing to Captain Perry's sug
gestion in regard to the officering of the Fulton
that the beginning of the engineer corps in the
navy was made. The Fulton was employed in
active service until 1842, when she was laid
up at Brooklyn for ten years. She was then
-practically rebuilt and again placed in com
mission. When the Pensacola navy-yard was
abandoned by the Confederates in 1802 the
Fulton, which was laid up in ordinary there,
was burned with the other craft.
When the Mexican War broke out the ouly
available steam vessels in the navy were the
Mississippi and Princeton, and they were at
once placed on blockade duty in conjunction
with several sailing frigates. Later two side
wheel steamersâ the Vixen and Spitefulâ ot
ii4o tons each were added to the fleet. They
tr.d, singularly enough, been built for the
Mexican Government, but on the outbreak of
hostilities were purchased by the United
States. Subsequently several other steam ves
ssii of smaller tonnage were purchased and
sent down to the gulf. In 1850 there was a
noticeable addition made to the steam vessels
of the nary by the completion of the frigates
Snsquehanna and Powh&tau, which were each
USO feet long and of nearly 4000 tons dis
placement. These were followed by two
' smaller craftâ the Saranac and San Jacintoâ ot
2200 tons displacement.
In 1854 six first-class steam frigates were
authorized by Congress, and the Merrimac,
Wabash, Norfolk, Roanok^, Minnesota and
Niagara were built at the Government yards.
They were full-rigged ships, could steam
eight knots and were exceptionally fast sail
ers. Five new screw sloops-of-war were added
to the navy by act of Congress in 1857, and
four of them, Pensacoia, Lancaster, Hartiord
and Richmond, were built by the Govern
ment, while the fifth, the Brooklyn, was built
by contract in New York. Four more screw
sloops were also shortly added, the Mohican,
Iroquois, Wyoming and Dakota, soon followed
by three smaller ones, the Narragansett, Semi
nole and Pawnee. All these vessels took part
in the Civil War.
During the War of the Rebellion the en
gineers corps did most valuable service and
made poisible theiour years' bloikade of the
Southern ports. At the beginning of hoÂ«tlli
ties there were 192 engineers in the service,
and 22 of them refcigued to join the Confeder
acy. After the increase of >trife the number
had grown at the end of 18G1 to 404 in the
regular service aud 3G4 acting engineers.
TheM men were distributed amongthe numer
ous merchant vessels the Government bought
â¢nd pressed into service and on the large
number built in the navy-yards.
The first ironclads, the Monitor, Galena and
New Ironsides, were built durintr the first year
of the war. The result of the great naval duel
in Hampton Roads having shown the value of
the monitor type a number of similar craft
ordered. Of these six were designed by
Ericsson, ihe builder of the Monitor. Thye
were named Passaic, Montauk, Catskill, Ph
tapsco, Lehigh and Sangamon, while the Nan
tucjict, Weenaw ken and Camanche were built
by different contractors. Most of these ves
sels are shli n float, the Camanche now lying
In the harbor of San Francisco.
Mr. Bennett (*ive3 a very comprehensive
*Aetch. of the origin of "relative rank," that ap
pie of discord which arrayed the line against
the staff, and during thirty years has continued
to distract the uaval service. It is to be hoped,
for the credit of the service, that this vexed
question may be satisfactorily settled before
many more Congressional sessions go by. The
time has come for the line officer to recog- j
nize the fact that he is largely dependent for j
' success in the conduct of the ship on his en
! Kineer. In the current number of the North
j American Review Admiral Colomb, the dis
| tinguished British admiral, in au article on
I "The Evolution of the Naval Oilicer," says:
"There is no doubt that, long alter its intro
duction, steam propulsion was despised and
ha.cd by the ablest and best among our naval
officers. Men went so far as to pride them
selves on profound ignorance of everything
relating to the steam-engine. Years elapsed
before the study of it became a road to promo
! tion. But when the engineer came on board
I he possessed a knowledge with regard to the
ghip which it was at first no disgrace to the
captainâ rather to his nonor, indeedâ not to
share. For the first lime tho younger man,
i with the lesser experience of sea life, was the
| superior in a knowledge which was necessary
Ito the ship. The captain was the official but
no longer the personal superior of the engineer
In his peculiar department, tor the first time
the conduct of the ship became the conse
; quence of a consultation between the captain,
i with a general but incomplete knowledge, and
i the engineer with a special but complete
j knowledge."
The captain is no longer a despot on board
I his ship; he has been changed into a consti
| tutional monarch and is dependent for nis
j supplies if not for instruction as to the course
he is to steer on a parliament personified by
the chief engineer. Mr. Bennett's book is pro
fusely illustrated.
HYSTERIA IN LITERATURE.
The astonishing development of hysteria in
I American literature within a comparatively
brief period may well arouse the concern of
Christian people of every denomination, says
a -writer in ihe New York Observer. By hyste
ria I mean that class of morbid, ever-wrought
writing, that gets Itself published In books
I with lurid titles ana nightmare coversâ a car
! nival of sensationalism, silliness and incom-
I prehensible nonsense. Some ol our most pro
i lific writers seem to have broken loose from
! literary bedlam, and to be capering and crack-
I ing their heels in the face of the public, as if
i there were no longer any such thing as de
cency or propriety to be expected of a man
who wields a pen. Tne improbable, the dis
tressing, the fantastic, the immoral, are all
laid under contribution to furnish a feast
that trill make the reader wriggle in his
chair. In one of these recent hysterical
! volumes three collaborators put their
heads together to devise, collect or
"adapt" the most horrible stories possiole
concerning Ihe torture and death of infants.
Th:s sort of thing is, perhaps, the worst
phase of the prevailing literature of hysteriaâ
] the use of the shocking, the revolting, the un
mentionable, as a means for attracting the
attention of the reading public. 1 hen there
is another phase of literary hysteriaâ the
supremely silly. Nine-tenths of the affected,
] abnormal school of modern writers cultivate a
j kind of obscure, giggling nonsense, because it
i is easier to produce merely silly things than
anything else.
Such hysteria as this is more harmless than
the convulsive sensationalism of a more virile
class of writers, but no reader ever gets any
inspiration or help or enlightenment out of it.
I It demoralizes by weakening the mental fiber.
' Associated wi;h the shocking and silly litera
tDre of modern hysteria, is the no less out
landish and meaniDgless '"poster" craze. In
deed, the modern poster seems to be a very
good visible reflection of the literature which
it is Intended to advertise.
There is really but one way to neutralize and
sterilize the hysterical in modern literature,
and that is to hold it up to honest, hearty
ridicule. There is material enough for satire,
certaiuly, in the fantastic, pretentious, morbid
compound of poor literature and false art that
I is now making such a persistent bid for popu
; lar favor. Those who are easily drawn by
some new thing (and their number is con
siderable) have been readily fascinated by
this dime museum type of literature. They
will crowd to see the disemboweled infant, the
hypnotized girl, the man who turns his con
science inside out, the yellow dancer, the red
realist, and their like, until somebody with a
healthier imagination shows them the ridicu
lousness and vulgarity of the whole thing.
Then they will all go home, laughing; and the
shutters of hysteria will be put up; and much
elaborate stage scenery will pass into the
hands of that relentless old junk- dealer
whom mortals call oblivion.
STORY OF JANE AUSTEN.
THE STORY OF JANE AUSTEX'S LIFKâ By
Oscar Fay Adams. Lee <t Shepard, Boston.
Frice Â«2.
The above is a new and illustrated edition
of Mr. Adams' popular life of the famous lady
novelist.
This "Story of Jane Austen's Life" is con
structed ou somewhat different lines from the
biographies previously published, it being the
intention of tne author to place Jane Austen
"before the world as the winsome, delightful
woman that she was, and thus dispel tne un
attractive not to say forbidding mental pic
ture which to many have formed of her." Mr.
Adams has spent much time and effort in the
preparation of the story, having visited all the
localities once fnmiiiar to Jane Austen, the
descriptions of Bath, Steventon, Chawton and
other places being very interesting as well as
accurate.
This new edition Is in several respects an
improvement upon the earlier one. The valu
able bibliography has been extended some
two pages, a detail which nil students of Miss
Austen will appreciate, and of still more in
terest will be found the reduced fac-simile oJ
an entire letter by Miss Austen, written in
August. 1796. But the distinguishing feature
of the new edition is furnished by the eigh
teen illustrations scattered through the vol
ume, which include the most memorable
scenes associated with Miss Austen's life and
work.

Yortc: The Century Company.
The third volume ol Professor 81oane's great
history of Napoleon U now out with a pro
fusion of fine portraits, colored war scenes
arjd battle maps illustrating the positions and
movements of the opposing troops. It opens
in 18OU with an account of the condition of
the Prussians after their defeat at Jana and of
ibe masterly energy with which the con
queror followed up his victory. It closes in
1812 with the evacuation of Moscow, nnd re
lates the beginning of the end, when the har
ried, sick and exhausted Napoleon of those
days left unattempted the military feats to
retrieve his disasters that the Napoleon of
earlier days would have essayed. Tnis vol

the principal actor in them cannot fail to te
of great interest.
Such was the sudden celerity of Napoleon's
pursuit of the Prussian armies, as Sloane re
cords it, that the Kiog would have been cap
tured but for the politic falsehood of the hero,
Blucher; and an offset to this perfidy was the
lie of the French hero, Lannes, who was said

to be the most honest of all Bonaparte's gen- j
erals, by which Uohenlohe was deceived into
needlessly surrendering a large army. The
marvel to the student ol history is not so
much that these heroic, honest, but astute
generals of an unscrupulous age should lie to
each other as that they should have believed
each other.
The beginning of Napoleon's great blunders
is pointed out to be the conscription of 1800,
and in the same year came bis complete sur
render to luxurious self-inau!gence. He
coolly avowed that he was not to be bound by
the plain virtues of ordinary men. it was
then that he met in Warsaw the beautiful
Countess Walcwska, and they became victims
of each other's fascination.
' In 1807 he began to relax his old method of
indefatigable attention to details and his dis
sipations increased. His reply to Josephine's
jealous reproaches is characteristic: "I am
different from every one else and eccept the
limitations of no other."
An incident recorded of the ambitious Corsi
can's ideas of the Turk and the Orient will be
of especial interest just now, when the Eastern
question is to the fore. At Tilsit a courier an
nounced to him the overthrow of the Sultan
Selim. "It is a decree of Providence, an nouuc
ing the end of the Ottoman empire," he cried,
and thenceforth much of his conversation was
concerning the Orient "As If inspired by
prophetic fire he sketched a missionary enter
prise for the liberation and regeneration of
Greece and for the emancipation and reor
ganization of the lands and people on the
Danube and in the Levant by distributing
among them enlightened sovereigns."
Among the most interesting features of the
volume are: The meeting of the Emperors at
Tilsit, when the Czar was completely captiva
ted by Napoleon's seductive powers; an esti
mate of the crafty Talleyrand; an account of
Luclen Bonaparte's magnificent adherence to
principle in the refusal of the tempting crown
of Italy; the crime of the subversion of the
Spanish monarchy; the danger of sacking
Spanish towns; Napoleon's threat of chastise
ment to the Spaniards, ending, "For God has
given me the power and the wilt to overcome
all obstacles"; the death of the hero Lannes,
when Napoleon wept; the results of the inves
tigation of Josephine's character, "She was
not virtuous, she was not strong, she was not
even very beautiful"; the filth campaign
against Austria, which Bonaparte said wus his
finest performance; the conqueror's meeting
with the savants, Wieland and Goethe, to
whom he showed more respect than he did to
royalty; and finally the planning of the Rus
siau invasion. â¢

imprisonments are really sometimes inflicted.
Another pretty feature is the ardent love of a
society woman who acts the good Samaritan
and tries to reinstate the returned convict into
the best social circles. Realizing the restraints
of finer feeling that blna the hero, she lets
her love-making go to lengths that would
be considered unwomanly under ordinary
circumstances.
A LOVE STORY.
LOVICE-By Mrs. Htmcerford. Philadelphia: j.
B. 1 li'p.n on Company. For rale in this Ciiy by
Joseph A. iloimann, Sutler street. Irice $1 26.
There are few writers who have attained
such a wide popularity In spite of adverse
criticism as has the "Duchess." The fact is a
remarkable exemplification of the odnge that
ti.ere ib no accounting for tastes. Perhaps it
is because that such beauties as her works
have are so plainly floating on the surface
that it require* no mental effort to grasp them,
and so to many minds they supply the most
restful recreation for idle hours. L. Q. C.
Lamar once said he liked occasionally to take
a spell off from serious thought and read
something that was absolutely trash. The
need of some such restiul reaction may be
shared by many others of fine intellectual
endowment, and the desire to read the "Duch
ess" may not always be evidence of lack of
depth.
The Lovice of this story is a lovable girl in
spite of the fact that although she utterly
despised her rival in love, the vulgar mulatto,
Miss Johnson, with a "swivel eye" and Â£15,000
a year, she yet faithfully attended the mulat
to's social functions. Lovice rails at the heir
ess behind her bark and wittily says insulting
things to her while a guest at her house.
Surely Mrs. Hunger.'ord would not in real life
have admired a girl who showed bo little
refinement and sense of honor, an<l yet the
fair heroine of this book seems seriously in
tended as a model of refinement held up to
contrast with the vulgarity ot the other
characters. It cannot be denied that the book
Is admirable in some ways, and it is harmless,
bright and clean.
THE BIBLE DEFENDED.
THE OLD TESTAMENT UNDER FIRE.
By A. J. F. Behrends: New York: Funk A
W agnails Company.
The author of this little book*, who is the
pastor of the Central Congregational Church
In Brooklyn, says that it was struck off at
white heat to meet the pressing emergency.
He had passed through the common ex
perience of doubting the accuracy of the Old
TÂ«stament, as a result of rending the higher
criticism, but after investigating the subject
for himself he came back to a faith in its his
torical accuracy and literal truth. He admits
that it contains incomplete nnd variant ac
counts, which thus far have refused to melt
together In the critical crucible, but he adds
that these do not discredit the entire record
nor reverse its general movement.
A PRIZE-WINNER.
THF MILL OF SILENCEâ By B. E. J. Capes.
Â« hicaco and New York: Rand, McNally & Co.
Price $1 6a
This is the winner of the second prize in the
Chicago Record's series of stories of myÃtery.
There were 816 competing, and the amount
divided among a few of the bent stories was
$30,000. The author's style is well adapted to
the writing of mysteries and before the first
chapter is finished he has placed the reader
under the spell of the weird. There is a great
deol more to the story than the invention of a
plot intricate enough to puzzle tbe wits of a
skilled detective. The peculiar characters de
scribed are interesting and the author pos
sesses the faculty of making the manner of
telling as much a reason for reading as the
matter told.
AN UNWISE MARRIAGE.
A PPOTLESS REPUTATIONâ By Dorothea
Gerard. Ni-w York: D. Appleton A Co. For
pale in this City by William Eoxey, Palace Ho
tel. Price 60 cents.
Geraldine is the lady beautiful in this
story, and the description of the way the
diplomat, Walter NolebroKe, met her in a
magnificent garden of blooms, in which she
is the choicest flower, and instantly felt an
immense impulse to kiss a tiny hurt place on
the girl's dainty finger, is well done. The in
troduction tempts the reader to read on and
learn the future of the fair one and the sud
denly made captive of her charms. The out
comeof things is unhappy. Geraldine's beauty
proved a curse.
ABOUT FISHER FOLK.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE â Br Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr. New Yorjf : The Century Com
pany. Price 91 SO.
The fishermen of the Shetland Islands have
here furnished Mrs. Barr with material for a
fairly good story. These people are the de
scendants of the Norsemen, and although they
have been Christians for generations they still
retain characteristics of the old heroic pagan
ism. In one of tbe characters the idea of ven
geance for a wrong as often seems to him a
virtue as do the milder teachings of his pro
fessed faith. The Christianity of these fisher
folk was Calvinism of the strictest type, and
the author speaks of them as being hedged
about "with tbe phantoms of a gloomy creed."
For this reason the title of the book fs "Pris
oners of Conscience." As the result of terri
ble trouble tbe hero ami heroine of the tale
learn the consolation of a more soothing creed.

The story is said to be founded on fact.
THE LIFE PHILOSOPHICAL.
ONE MAN WHO WAS CONTENTâ By Mrs.
Kcbuyler Van Rensselaer. New Yoric: The
Century Company. Price $1.
Four short stories, the first of which has
been published in the Century Magazine. It
tenches that the evils of life should be ac
cepted with something more than resigna
tion, for merely to say "I am resigned" is to
acknowledge defeat and to give up the fight
for happiness. "A brave soul cannot do this,
because it would be ashamed, and a wise soul
cannot because it feels that as it must con
tinue in this world simple common-sense com
mands it to gather all of good that the world
may still present." Two ol the other stories
are founded upon the author's experience as
Inspector of Common Schools in New York.

Richard Henry savage Chicago and Mew
York : Hand, McNally tfe Co. i'rtce 25 cents.
The storyopens with the stirring events of
1840 in tli i- State, and there is a mingling of
history and fiction through many fluent pages
It tells of the seizure of the territory by the
United States and of the deep plots and ambi
tions underlying it. Some account is given
of the wild days of San Francisco's beginnings,
when respectability had to give up the cen
tral part of the City to gijded and reckless
vice. The pathos of the change to the old
Spanish families is described as the superb
domain passed under the dominion of the
American.

This is a little book of short poems of patriot
ism, religion and sentiment, and one rather
long one on the "Visions of St. Paul of the

Ouida hes already another short novel in
the press, although "Le Selve" has been out
but a few weeks. The new story shows the
difficulty of putting ideas of social equality
into practice. The title is "The Altruist."
Rumor has run wild in talking about R. D.

A recent sale of books in London brought
out a curious fact. It was a presentation copy
of Keats' poems, 1817, first edition, with the {
autograph, '-To W. Wordsworth, wiÂ»h the
author's sincere reverence," and brought $230,
but Wordsworth had never even cut the leaves.
Mr. Froude's ''Erasmus" has been translated
into Dutch. A literary Hollauder complains
however, that the work is '-very bad."
"Froude," he says, "does not seem to have had |
any knowledge of what had been written on
the subject on the Continent in recent years."
Mr. Barry Pain is engaged on a romantic
history of Robin Hood, and most people are
hoping he will treat the subject with hi* char
acteristic whimsicality. But as Walter Crane
is to illustrate it perhaps Mr. Barry Pain will
curb his sense of humor and go in for ortho
dox medieval romance, which would be too '
cruel.
Besides a number of new pieces which the
volume of selections from the poems of George
Mered'th is expected to contain, gome oc the

Mrs. Julia Davis, who died at Clifton a few
days ago at the great age of 94, was probably,
the Athenaeum points out, the last survivor
of the intimate friends of Charles Lamb. She
was the daughter of Joseph Hume of Montpel
lier House, Notting Hill, where Lamb, Good
win and Hazlitt were constant guests. She
married Vice- Admiral DaviÂ«, R. N., and was
the mother of the late Mrs. Augusta Webster,
the poetess.
Mr. Ruskin is in good health again, but still
abstains from all literary work. Ruskin and
Emerson met at Oxford ebout twenty-five
years ago, and their first impressions of each
other were not complimentary, "i found Em
erson's mind a total blank," said Ruskin to a
friend, "in matters of art." "I found myself
wholly out of sympathy with Kuskiu's views,"
said Emerson; "1 wonder such a genius can
be possessed of such a devil."
Andrew Lang has somewhere said that It is
a melancholy feature oi the present age that
young people say they cannot read Dickens
just as they cannot read Scott This dialogue,
overheard in the Abbey on Saturday, lends
some color to Mr. Lang's averment: He (in
structively, pointing with his cane to Dickens'
grave)â Charles Dickens. She (hesitatingly)â
Charles Dickens. A writer, wasn't he? He
(rather impatiently) â Yes, he wrote some
tales. Sheâ Just fanny!
Russia's celebrated historian, Professor
Alexander Buchner, is dead. He was 62 years
of age and was born in St. Petersburg. Pro
fessor Buchner was a .student of Heidelberg
ana his German tendencies continually proved
an obstacle to his advancement in Russia.
In spite of them he occupied the chair of Rus
sian history in most of the large universities of
Russia at different times. Most of his numer
ous contributions to Russian history were
writteu in German, though a few were in his
native language,
Justin McCarthy is in very.bad health again.
The strain involved in completing the fifth
volume of the "History of Our Own Times,"
which is now in the hands of the publishers,
has proved too much for him and his doctor
has ordered him a period of complete rest. He
will be unable to answer any letters for some
lime to come. Miss McCarthy, who has re
lieved her father to a large extent of the bur
den of letter-writing, is quite unable to cope
with the heavy correspondence and requests
that this explanation may be made public, so
as to prevent unnecessary disappointment.
We referred last week to the crass ignorance
of some would-be literary people. The fol.'ow

from the current number of "The Bookman":

A most Interesting littte volume is to be
published by the Mncmillan Company under
the title, "Burns and His Times as Gathered
From His Poems," by J. O. Mitchell, LL.D.
The volume has grown out of a paper which
appeared in the Glasgow Herald about nine
years ago on Burns' birthday. One passage
after another in quoted, and these are joined
together with remarkable skill to show the.
aspect of the country made lamous by Burns
pen, and many a topic is thus shrewdly illus
trated until one closes the book with a sense
of astonishment at tbe amount of information
gathered in this way in regard to the food,
drink and clothing, the church, the politics,
recreations and superstitions of the various
classes and masses for whom and about whom
Burns wrote.
For the past two years Mark Twain has been

I it will be his greatest work, his masterpiece;
in a recent letter he refers to it as follows: "I
am more than satisfied with it these latter
days. I wouldn't trade it for any book I have
ever written, and I am not an easy person to

It was cold that morning â about as cold
b day as ever comes to mil I Californiaâ and
the sidewalks glistened with a thin white
coverlet of fro3t which the night had left,
and which so delighted little Bob as he
came along, now walking, now sliding "on
the ice," as he termed it, with a small
book in one hand, and the other, when
he was not using it to balance himself, in
hi* pocket.
"Was the snow anytninglike the frost?"
he was saying to nimself. "Yes, it must
be something like it, only deeper, so the
sidewalks didn'i show through. And the
ice? Well, that was thick, like snow;
only 'twas harder, so a feller couldn't
fink. What fun it must be to play in the
soft, white snow, and skate and slide ovsr
the smooth ice! And, after all, the place
where it is cant be very far away," he
mused. "Perhaps the train around the
corner goes to ihe very spot. Yes, I'll go
there some time."
Then other things attracted his atten-
"A jolly fat man swung him on the
platform."
tion, and he went on to school. That
morning a desire to travel to the land
where snow and ice prevail had awakened
in Bob's busy little brain.
Many times after that he thought and
planned about bis intended travels to
wintry lands, and one evening surprised
his papa by asking with an air of great
importance "for two nickels, papa."
'"Why do you wish just two nickels, my
boy?" taking the child on bis knee ana
giving Mm a kiss.
"Oli, 'cause," answered eager little Rob,
"some time I'm going on the train' around
the corner."
"Oh, you are, are you? Well, I'll give
you three; one for candy on the way,"
said his papa, not haying the least idea
that Hob was in earnest about the train.
Happy little Bob said good-night and
trudged eff to bed as proud as he could be.
He tucked his three nickels safely under
his pillow, feeling sure that they were a
treasure valuable enough to tempt any
robber.
Next morning he went to school as
usual, all wrapped up in his own pl*ns,
for he had made up his mind that ibis was
thÂ° day for his wonderful trip.
How he ever got through the morning
hours and waited for tt.e teacher to dis
miss her little pupils is a thing impossible
to explain.
Nevertheless, he did; but at last he was
free I
He walked down the street ahead of his
schoolmates as fast as his short, fat legs
could go, without saying a word to any
one; turned down the main street and
finally stopieil in front of the depot,
where be watched and li9.ened for the
train, all the while holding bis precious
nickels in his chubby littie hand.
In a few moments â long one?, Rob
thoughtâ the train came thundering in to
the station.
When it stopped the crowd surged
down toward it, he alone with the rest.
A jolly, fat man swung him up on the
platform, and Rob. rather out ol breath by
this "sudden lift," entered the car and
sat down b? a window.
His little cheeks were flushed with ex
citement, and he was, oh, so happy when
he heard the bell ring and felt the train
move off, for now he knew he was really
on his way to the land of snow.
After the town had been left far behind
the conductor came in to collect the tick
ets. He took the one from the lady who
sat next to Rob, and was about to pass on
when Kob, holding out one of his treas
ures and stepping partly in the aisle, said.
'â¢Here* mine, too."
"Oh, I don't wish that, you keep it,"
said the conductor, lauzhing, and wonder
ing if the lady next to Rob was his mother.
The little boy sat down again, watching
"Our tiny traveler was fast asleep."
the conductor walk off, and tried to think
of some reason why he did not take his
iare. "Perhaps," he thought, "he's fond
of little boys like me, and lets 'em all
ride for nothin'."
Ue ciimbed up on the car seat, and rest
ing bis elbows on the window sill looked
cut on the trees and fields which flew so
| rapidly past him, or seemed to, rather.
He was very quiet now, piÂ»nly because
there was no one to talk to him, for there
were no children near him and the lady
on the next seat was busily reading a
magazineâ and partly because tne pano
ramic view without kept both eyes and
thoughtÃ very, very busy. He saw so
many strange things, but there was no
i one to explain or answer any inquiry.
The train grew warm and close, dark
ness crept alowly but surely over all the
great outside world, Rob's tired eyelids
I dropped over the blue eyes and the curly
j head bent down on the little arms and
our tiny traveler was fast aileepl

bis mother come for him? I don't under
stand how the ran have the heart to leave
liim here alone."
"Dear, I think we ought to wait and see
(every one has gone out now), perhaps he
has lust his mother somewhere on the
way and does not know it. He can't be
left here alone!" said the young one,
warmiy.
"I think I'll awaken him," said thÂ»
elder, as she lifted him in her arms as
gently as his own mother would have
done, and spoke to him in soft tones as
she carried him out to the platform and
down the steps into the waiting-room.
When he opened his tired eyas and real
ized that it was night time and that he
was with strangers, far away from his
own loved ones, the tears would come, and
he put aside all questions with the piteous
cry of, "I want my mamma!"
''Yes, yes ! you shall have your mamma,
dear," they answered him, "but first try
to ba a brave boy and tell to us where
your mamma is, then soon she'll be very
glad, for you will be in her arms again."
After much questioning Rob managed
to tell his story between his sobs, of how
he had come so far all alone, of how lie
had left the kindergarten and why he had
com?, and that neither his papa nor
mamma knew anything about where he
was.
lie told his name and the street on
which he lived, but could not remember
the number of his papa's house.
Then they took the Jittip wanderer home
with them, gave him a k â â >>'>'! supper and
prepared a comfortable little bed, in which
be was covered up snug ami warm after
being rocked to sleep in the arms of the
young lady. Hit face wore a peaceful
smile, for they had comforted him with
the thought that "Papa would come to
him soon."
After he was sweetly sleeping they sat
down to await an answer to the dispatch,
which they had sent over the wires as
soon as they i ad learned Roboie's papa's
name. They had doubts about the mes

come all right, staling that he would be
there on the first morning train.
Next day, Rob was his own happy little

Tears of joy ran down the cheeks 01 the
strong man as he hugged and kissed his
boy again and again. Rob was very impa
tient to start for home when he heard how
his poor mother had cried and worried
about her thoughtless little non, but they
had to wait for the Uain, of course.
Robbie's papa had a long talk with the
ladies who had befriended the child and
finally it was decided that after a few
weeks they should come and pay Robbie's
mamma a visit to allow her to express her
zratitude for her boy's safety, in her own
sweet way.
Good-bys were said and the afternoon
train bore father and son on to the waiting
mother. How much brighter und more
pleasant everything seamed to Robbie,
with bis own dear parent beside him to
answer his many questions and explain
what he did not understand.
And then in the evening when home
was reached, and he was clasped once
more in his mother's arms, ne was a
happy boy indeed.
When she tucked him in his own little
bed that night he said, "I'll never go 'way
and leave you again, mamma; next time
I'll take papa and you along."
He never knew how the hot tears fell
from her cheeks as she bent over and
kissed him long after he had fallen asleep,
when she thought of the dangers he had
escaped, and her heart swelled with
thanks to the loving Father who had
euidÂ«d his footsteps into such gentle

Johnnie Got It Wrong.
The teachers in the kindergarten find a
perpetual fund of amusement in the
funny little people committed to their
charge. One of them â one of the teach
ers â is responsible for this story of a mite
of a lad, who possesses a high, shrill
voice, and uses it on every possible occa
sion.
She bad been teaching the class to sing
"America," a slow and somewhat painful
operation. Over the verse, "Land wnere
our fathers died, land of the pilgrims'
pride," she labored long and earnestly,
and when at last they seemed familiar
with the words â they picked up the air
amazingly quick â her attention was par
ticularly drawn to the shrill-voiced young
ster just mentioned. He was certainly in
troducing a variation on the test, but just
what it was she couldn't make out.
High rose the thin voice above the
chorus, the little fellow singing with the
{ utmost; confidence something which cer
tainly wasn't in the original version.
'Now, scholars," said the teacher, "we'll
all stop and let Johnnie sing hit Terse
alone. Johnnie is such a nice singer.
I Now, Johnnie!"
80 Johnnie, with an amazing grin,
lifted up his razor-edged soprano af.er
this fashion:
"lan where our fazers dies,
Jan 1 of tli' pills au 1 piei."
And it took Johnnie a great deal loneer
j to unlearn this extraordinary combina-
tion of nonsense than it did for him to
tick up the entire song originally. â De

Dear Editress: Last week mamma, Maggie
and we three boys took an outing for four
days at Uncle John's in Santa Rosa, and I tell
you they were four glorious days.
We took the 3:30 p. m. boat at the ferry,
after a weary waiting for that hour to come.
AtC p. m. wa leit t.".e train at Santa Rosa,
! and soon after were eating our dinner at
I auntie's. We all enjoyed that dinner very
i much, things tasted so fresh, and we were
hungry after our long ride.
We scarcely took time to sleep during our
visit, getting up bright and early every mom-
Ing.
The first day I found a whifflstree and with
some ropes fixed a team, then Horace and I
started in "farming" right a nay.
My aunt said if we wished to larm we might
get the weeds out of her walks. We did it by
spells and finished before we left.
We enjoyed picking wild flowers and the
poppies were perfectly beautl'ul. One day
when we were out gathering flowers Horace
found a frog. He dropped his bouquet and
picking him up ran to the house as fast as he
could go. But Mr. Frog gave one jump and
was off in a jiffy the moment Horace let go of
him.
We tried to visit the Spreekels chicken
ranch, where there are 15,000 chickens, but a
sign of ''No admittance" kept us out, so we
contented ourselves by picking more poppies.
Horace crept through the fence after a few of
the golden cups, because he said they were
larger than the roadside ones.
My uncle's large dog, King, had to be kept
chained all through our visit. He was too
friendly and was so large that he knocked us
down when he played with us.
We took our cousin to school, driving '-Old
Harry."
One evening Uncle John said : ''Well, I must
go pail the cows."
I asked him what that meant. "Oh," an
swered he, "that's 'Missouri' for milking."
Our four days passed very quickly. We were
sorry to leave, for playing farmer is good fun,
but our auntie made us glad by saying we
might come again some time.
I shall write another letter to you after our
next visit. Your little friend,

THE STAGE.
Coneratulations to the Alcazar manage
ment are in order lor the painstaking,
conscientious way in which it has pro
duced irancis Powers' c ever little melo
drama cf Chinatown, "The First Born."
Putting on a Chinese play is a risky thing
to do, from a box-office standpoint, con
siderin? the strong local feeling against
anything that emanates froru Chinatown,
and putting c;i nnything daring and oric
i'ial by an Amer.can playwright is a still
more ripsy thin* to do â at leist one would
imagine so to juJge from the managerial
raÂ«sion for snubbing the American play
vright, and bestowing the cakes and ale
ami dollars upon playwrights "made in
Europe." Virtue has met with a substan
tial reward at the A cazar, for its attempt
to encourage native talent has been heart
ily indorsed by large audiences, and Pow
ers has shared with De Wolf Hopper the
honcr of beins; the only actors in town
called on nightly for an oraticn.
How beautifully patriotic it sounds for
managers to pratr, as they are in the
habit of doing, about their consuming de-
Bire to obtain American plays! When
yon come down to cold facts, though,
scarcely one of them is moved by the
faintest desire to obtain anythins of the
sort. Plays are like hats and bonnets â
tne styles originate in Europe, and better
is a failure made in London or stamped
with a well-known Parisian name than a
work with all the elements of success that
only emanates from a plebeian American
Bource. "I would give a fortune for a
good American plar,' 1 cries the ereat
American manager in the intervals of
making out his itinerary for a trip to
Europe "in search of novelties," and the
little manager, whose business does not
justify him in exploiting the European
field, keeps his weather eye open for any
English plays he can get, and la his heart
of hearts feels just as much contempt as
the big manager for the struggling Ameri
can playrwight.
Just think of the thousands and thou
sands of American plays that are annually
written by American writers and rejected,
often unread, by American managers,
and then believe, if you can, the oft
repeated statement that there is no merit
in any of these plays. Does it not stand
to reason that with so much smoke there
must be at least a few sparks here and
there of true dramatic fire? Indeed,
chance now and then gives the iie to the
managers' parrot-like formula, "Good
American plays are not to be had." Look
at the recent instance of "My Friend
From India." H. A. dv Souchet, the
author, was a humble telegraph oper
ator, who had the temerity to write a
j lay and send it the round of the theaters,
where it led a nomadic life fjr several
years, going from one manager to an
other, despised and rejected by all, till
Smith and Rice were persuaded, almost
tullitd, in fact, into reluctantly taking
hold of it. The managers who turned up
their noses at "My Friend From India"
and rushed to "secure novel' les from
Europe" are ready to kick themselves
now. for it was ths richest treasure-trove
of the season just ended, and most of the
imported plays met with no better fate
ihan they deserved. Sardou's ''Spiritism"
headed the list cf colossal tiuscos; "The
Sign of the Cross" fared little better:
"The Seats of tne Mighty" aroused the de
rision of New Yorn, and there were
others, many others. In fact, the only
really excellent imported plays were
'Rosemary" and "Under the Red Robe,"
and their success was more than dis
counted by the success of an American
play. G;liette's 'Secret Service," to wit.
We have it on no les? authority than
that of the great Barnum that Americans
like to be fooled, and it is the business of
managers to rind what the public likes
end Â«cc that it gets it, to these asiut*
gentlemen say with their lips "We want
American plays, tut we cannot get them,"
and in their hearts they mow that
American plays are just ihe last thing
they do want. Meanwhile the dear, gul
lible public hags the fond delusion that
in: ported plays are its proper mental pab
ulum and dutifully chortles over imported
jokes that doubtless have a deep signifi
cance in the land of their nativity, but
are often absolutely withont meaning over
here. If managers will insist on produc
ing imported and unadapted plays, they
should at least devote part of the pro
gramme to a compact little key explaining
the jokes and allusions, which lose their
meaning on crossing the Atlantic.
Just to name one instance. The first
piece played at the Alcazar last week is ,
"English, quite English, you know," and
in one scene a good deal of ttie fun de
pends on the despairing efforts of an
elderly and excitable gentleman to find
from a Bradshaw how the trains run to
Edinburgh. A:ter turning over a couple i
of hundred pages or so he gives it up as a
bad job and sends the girl out for ail "A
8.C." What was there in this to touch !
the sympathies and arouse the risibilities !
of the spectator who has never traveled 1
on English railroads? XotJing, abso- j
lutely nothing. But the joke lias n deep (
significance to the man (or woman) who j
has devoted hours of mental anguish
to chasing an elusive train tnrough the
mazy labyrinths of the standard English j
railway guide. That man has gener
ally found that a train starts irom half a
dozen depots simultaneously; that in one
( o.umn ol Bradshaw it is a baggage-train,
stopping everywhere, and in another col
umn it is Â»n express, stopping nowhere,
and that just when it seems to have been
pinned d< wn to behaving as a well-regu
lated train should, the coiumns of Brad
shaw suddenly seem to joggle things up
again and send it on a wild, erratic tour all
over the United Kincdom, that ends no
wnere except in the despair of the person
who wants to travel cy it The man who
i.as grappled with this Bradahawem
task aud, reduced to the verge of insanity,
has finally sent oat for an A B C
railway guide and found immediate re
lief, can possibly discover pome exquisite
junior in ihe spectacle of an irascible and
excited old eentleman looking in a hurry
for a train in Bradshaw and finally in mad i
aespair making a football of the demon ;
railway guide and sending out for an "A
B C." But how many people in the audi
ence last week had ever braved the dau
! gers of brain fever by wrestling with the
intricacies of Bradsbaw? Certainly not
enough to make the joke commonly un
' derstood.
The fact is that in selecting plays
: scarcely a roan among the managers
â â  seems to have any opinion of his own
judgment, but their universal maxim
seems to be ''when in doubt go to Europe
for plays," and the American public is so
enured to this metliod of procedure that
' it takes imported plays as a matter of
course.
Francis Power?' Chinese play is an
other proof, if nnother proof were needed,
of how wonderfully rich this cenntrv is
in dramatic subjects that lend themselves
to strone local cooring. From Maine to
San Francisco the country nbounds with
I rich field* for the dramatist. Only a
month or two ago we saw "Shore Acres,"
| a piny full of the atmosphere of New
England, and now we are given its very
antithesis in "The First Born," which is
redolent of the Orient, but it reproduces
passions sighs, sounds and (alas! that it
1 should be sa:d) smells that all exist on
; American soil. The ereat American play
i of the future will not be Ccinese, but it
is a hopeful sign when Ameri
! Bra authors plunge themselves, as
| Francis Powers has done, into the actual
ities of the life they tee around them,
even if it is only the life of Chinatown, for
it shows that they are going to nature for
their subjects, and the great American
, play, when it does come, will be racy of
some distinctive phase of life in the land
of the free. This comine drama is a good
: deal talked about, but mana ers do not
seem to have much real fnitb in its advent.
[ It will come, however, althougn the day
' may tarry, and wtien ii does a reaction
| will follow in its wake. Managers will
i tnrn then to America for p.ays, and
\ Americans will no longer have to sit like
1 foreigners in their own theaters, laughing
â¢ leebiy at imported jokes they do not un
' demand. Marie Evelym.

Corir\r\e Is Star of the "Ex
celsior Jr." Gomparuj.
Corinne has not come to the coast to
play hpr return engagement at the Co
lumbia Theater, the "Excelsior Jr. " com
pany is without her as the star, and
thereby hangs a tale.
"Up to the time of Mrs. Kimball's
death," said a well-known theatrical
man yesterday, "Corinne, although
over 20 yeari of age, bad been
brought up to know absolutely noth
ing of business or of the world.
She went from the theater to her hotel
and from her hotel 10 th>- tinnier always
carefully watched and guarded, and was
; never allowed to hare an admirer or to see
anything of the world. .:
"It was almost to be expected that a
girl brought tin in that way would display
little business ability wnen she was sud
i denly left alone in the world. Mrs. Kim
ball did not leave her a fortune, that
statement wasâ âwell, it was a bit of
press advertising, but Corinne could make
money, lor her name is a good one to
draw. The lone-star business has been so
much overdone of late that Corinne could
never expect to shine alone, and the worst
of it was that no sooner was Corinne left
to look out for her own interest than sne
kicked over the traces and demanded the
dismissal of all , the other talent from the
company. : :. "':â >'.. â¢.â  .-;';. V-* * '":'â  . >/^j.;y/-!} \
"Her. managers 'could do nothing with
her, and on her last visit to the Columbia
there were scenes every night because the
critics, praised Cawthorn and some of the
others more-' than they .did Corinne: > In
fact the San Francisco criticisms set the
thing goinr. v v Corinne demanded; their
dismissal, and the managers insisted . that
the star, could do nothing without good
support, i- *-""'" '-'"'.: â â â â  'â '-, ":
'â -'â ' "The poor girl was badly advised. She
had fallen in love with C. Reguson, the
j conductor of the orchestra,' who was ten
years older than herself; but it was her
"first love affair, and sue took it very seri
i ously And listened to all his suggestions.
! Things came to s a climax in New York,
when her managers offered her 'The
Little " Bandit,' which 'â¢ had = been written
j expressly for - the company/ by -â  Edgar
Smith and Hermann Pertet, the authors
jof 'Miis Philadelphia' and 'Miss Man

age that 'her managers let her i go. and

fying What it was to be. ' That is why the
return date of the 'Hendrick Hudson
Jr.' Company at the Columbia has Saaie
Martinot instead of Corinne as the star.
"And Corinne herselff 01). slie is rest

is to marry her conductor when he gets
his divorce, which will not be long now, I
believe."
Fitzsimmorvs' J^clodrama.
Stellar contributions, chiefly from soci
ety and the prize-ring, conMnne to pour in
upon the stage. The next ornament to
the dramatic profession will he Fitzsim
mons, who is to appear as a hero of melo
drama and knock out the villain who has
betrayed his sister.
Martin Jnlian has commissioned Hal
Reiii to write the play for the doughty
Bob's debut, and thinking perhaps that
he will feel more at home in an oocupstton
that he has once actually adorned Fit*
simmons will appear as a blacksmith.
Ot course h â¢ will impersonate all that is
good and noble, as becomes a hero of
melodrama. In the first act he wiil de
light tlie audience by shoeing n horse on
the stage. Later on in the proceedings,
when he linds that a villain has broken
his sister's heart and wrecked his little
home, he gives vent to such noble senti
ments as '"Tlie strong and honest arm of
the black-smith shall stand between you
and shame."
There is a prize-fight in the fourth act.
and with his sooils as the victor the re
doubtable "Bob" pays off the mortgage
Irom bis old Homestead, and saves his en
tire family from the poorhouse. Julian is
to appear in the arena as master of cere
monies.
The dramatist is to have the play ready
for rehearsal in two weeks, but it is said
that he has already practically completed
it.

tion are San Jose on Wednesday, Fresno
Thursday, and Los Angeles Friday and
Saturday, Stockton May 24, Sacramento
May 25. From a financial standpoint Mr.
Hopper's en;aÂ»;ement at the Baldwin hÂ»3
been moat successful. The house was
j sold out solidly every night. It is unfor
tunate that the Hoppers could not mako
a longer visit, hut an imperative summer
i engagement at the new theater at Mun-
I hattan Beach calls them back East. At
I the coast cities "El Capitan" will be rre
i sented with all the completeness which
characterized its production in the Last
and at the Baldwin Theater.
QoodWirVs Bet.
People who know the inside of things
I dramatic say it is not so much love and
j devotion to San Francieco that are incit
ing Nat C. Goodwin to pay a return visit
here so soon after his last engagement as a
desire to win a bet.
With the close of hfs season in this
i City, at the conclusion of his coming en
j gagement at the Baldwin Theater, Nat C.
| Goodwin- will have more than carried out
! the winning end of the bet concocted by
I himself and a number of friends to the
effect that he has traveled over a greater
number of mile? in his season of eleven
months than any other theatrical organi
zation has ever covered in the sam- space
lof time. Immediately after the arrange
ments were made Jast June, the comedian
and hi 3 company came across the conti
! nent by a most zig-zag route, making a
j great many mile?. His trip to and
I through Australia, and his subsequent ra
j turn, added something over 15,0dQ miles.
I Upon landing here he was routed through
the North and into Canada. From there
be jumped indirectly to Tampa, Fla.
Mile alter mile of country on the Atantic
i Coast were crossed end recrossed. The
| jumps of the company were the talk of
j i he entire profession in the East, and Mr.
Goodwin finished up his remarkable
' travel by once again coming across the
continent, and will return without a stop
to New York at the finish of his Baldwin
engagement. He will have traveled by
that time a greater number of miles than
it would take one to travel in order to
circumnavigate the globe.

fifty miles for Â£1000, Â£250 to be deposited ty
both, as a guarantee of good iaith. Sandow'a
manager. Warwick Brookes Jr., has replied
that toe strong man is willing, but as his pro
fessional engagements are booked for twenty
one months irom now. he does not consider
it worth wnile io have such a sum as Â£250

ably reply that a race of fifty miles ought to be

quarters.

A COMBAT
WITH TIGERS
BY !>AN DE QUILLE r
"No," said Tom Moran, "adventures
don't seem to come ray way. My experi
ences in that line would hardly be worthy
of mention, Liv somehow Brother Bob
lias a genuine talent for tumbling into
all manner of adventures. Brother Bob
has had quite a number of pretty close
calls in the wild regions in which we have
traveled, but he has plenty of grit and
has always been able to pull through."
Tom Moran is a miner who was gradu
ated in the Comstock school of mining
years ago and who has since had much
experience in Mexico, Australia, India
and other gold-producing countries.
"It is singular that you should have
been able to travel through so many
strange countries without a few hair
breadth escapes or some other experi
ence* worthy of being related," said one
of the old Comstock friends who ware
questioning Tom in regard to his travels
in foreign land?. "Did you never run
against a tiger while in India?"
"Ticer," said Tom, with a laugh. "Well,
yes, I've run aeainst the 'tigers' of nearly
every country oil the two sides of the
glebe."
'â¢I am speaking now of the real, roaring
ramping Bengal tigerâ the striped beast of
the jungle," said the Comstocker. "I saw
quite a number of tigers while in India
and went aftrr the animals on regular
hunts. I killed a few while i was there,
in order to get sonitTgood skins."
"Never got into close quarters with
one?"
'â¢Well, not very; but Brother Bob had
rather a bad bout with a big hill tiger up
in Nepaul."
"Did Bob get away with the tiger?"
"\es, Brother Bod is true grit; the tiger
was killed."
"As you had no adventures of your own
during your travels, Tom," said v Com
stocker, 'suppose you give us the story of
Bob's tiger fight."
"1 am Korry Brother Bob is not here to
tell you about his battle with 'Madame
Stripes,' but as he is not with \is this even
ing I will eive you a little sketch of the
affair as 1 saw it.
"Brother Bob and I were up on the Ne
paul frontier, headed for the lower slopes
of the Himalayas.
"In place of the ducks, cranes, coots
and pelicans of the lngoons along the low
land course of the Koosei wo now begau
to see quail, partridges, peafowl, florican
and other upland birds. In places hidden
in patches of dense jungle and overgrown
with vines and creepers were dilapidated
temples indicating that the whole country
had at some time been inhabited, though
in the present age only a few scattered
villages are to be fouud. Outside of the
villages there are here and there huts in
habited by the 'gwalla,' or cowherd caste,
and these huts of the men of the cattle
stations are often in the heart of almost
impenetrable stretches of jungle.
''While in thi9 beautiiul region our
guns kept us well supplied with all kinds
of game, and we first aud last killed many
wolves, jackals, leopards and about a
dozen tigers, great aud small. The Brit
ish and wealthy natives almost always
use elephants in hunting tigers, some
times having fifty or more of the huge
beasts in line; but as we were not in a
position to command a supply of ele
phants, we did our work on foot, hiring a
score or moie of coolies, with tomtoms,
firecrackers and horns to beat through
email patches of jungle. At first we
mounted ourselves on 'mychans,' bamboo
platforms, at the point where we expected
the same to appear, but after we bad
learned something of the nature and ways
of the tiger we did not bother with plat
forms, but took our chances on the ground.
"The gwallas of the region were always
ready to bring us news of a tiger having
killed one of their cattle, and wben we
cot news of a 'kill' we were soon out after
the killer. Often the gwallas would be
able to point out the patch of jungle to
which the tiger had retired after making
the kill and feasting his fill.
"It was here in this foothill region that
Brother Bob had his adventure with a big
hill tiger. A 'ahekarry,' a native expert
hunter, who keeps himself well posted in
regard to the movements of gama and
manages hunts for both British and rich
natives, one day came to our camp and
proposed to give us some sport. He said
that as neither the English nor the native
princes were hunting at that season busi
ness was very slack with him. He offered
for a very reasonable price to bring out
his people and beat through a piece of
jungle which he knew to be alive with all
kinds of game. As a part of the bargain
Brother Bob and I were to kill as many
wild hogs, deer and the like as we could
knock over, the shekarry saying his
people were all very hungry for meat.
"The particular piece of jungle selected
by the old game expert to be beaten
through lay between the forks of two
Jarge streams with high and steep banks.
A more favorably situated jangle lor sport
could not have been found. As Bob and
I would station ourselves near the junc
tion of the two streams nothing could pass
that way without being seen. We took
stations about fifty yards apart at a point
where the jungie became somewhat thin
and open, each thrusting into the ground
a leafy branch of parass to serve ss a
screen or blind. After a long wait we
heard faintly in the distance the sound of
the tomtoms and the shouts of the beat
ers as they advanced into the jungle.
"Presently we heard a rustling upon
the stray leaves in front, and a troop of
monkey?, loudly chattering their alarm,
came hopping out of the dense jungle.
"As yet we had seen no deer or other
desirable game, but the beaters were still
faraway. Talcing a peep from behind my
screen, I was somewhat surprised to see a
large female tiger come gliding out of the
thick jungle, crouching close to the ground
as she passed into the open. She was on
Brother Bob's side of the jungle and was
moving straight toward him, apparently
more concerned about the commotion be
hind her than afraid of danger in front.
Bob had also seen the tiger and bad
dropped to one knee behind his screen
and leveled his rifle. Every moment I
expected to hear the report of Bob's gun,
as the tiger was witnin ten yards oi his
blind and was moving slowly.
"Some noise in the jungle frightened
the skulking beast and, after a quick back
ward glance, it blindly bounded forward.
At the second bound the tiger landed
aimost on top of Bob, as he crouched be
hind hie fracile screen. Instantly he iired,
thrusting his rifle at the beast without
aim. Wounded by the shot, the tiger ut
tered a howl of ra. c, dashed aside the
screen and struck Bob a blow with a fore
paw that sent bis gun flying and left him
stretched senseless on his back.
"1 rushed forward at once to Bob's as
sistance. As I ran the infuriated beast
threw i.ersell upon Bob and began tearing
at him with her teeth. Hearing a sound
as of cracking bones I thought every rib
in poor Bob's body was being crushed. As
I feared to use my rifle I threw it down
and drew my revolver. Siy yells, as 1
rushed on the tiger, caused her to cease
teanng at BoD and fix her eyes upom me.
" THE TIGER SPRANG UPON BROTHER BOB."
But she still retained her position across
Bob's breast while showing her teeth and
snarling at me.
"I thought it probable that she was so
badly wounded as not to be able to rise
upon her legs and so decided '.o take her
at close quarters and make sure of her.
With my pistol in my right hand and in
my left a long-biaded knife, sharp as a
razor, I crept forward. I advanced
crouched almost upon my kneÂ«3, as the
tiger's position across poor Bob was such
that I feared to fire with a downward
range.
"I had got up within ten feet of the
t : ger when she suddenly left Bob and
leaped at me. The charge of the beast was
a surprise, but by a backward move I
avoided her leap and as she passed fired
my pistol into her neck, at the same mo
ment plunging the knife into her side up
to the hilt. She fell and aid not move
from where she landed, the pistol shot
having broten her neck.
"Seeing the tiger was in its death strug
gles I turned my attention to Brother
Bob, who wu still stretched unconscious
upon the ground. The beaters were fast
approaching through the jungle with
great uproar and thumping of tomtoms,
wild hogs in droves, both black and gray,
were rushing by, spotted deer were charg
ing past and the whole jungle seemed
alive with game of all kinds, some droves
of wild pigs almost running over me.
"I was juit stooping over Bob when a
huge male tiger bounded out of the jungle
and halted within ten feet of where I
â food. I bad 107 pistol upon him in an
instant, and as his head was so held that
a bullet would not glance from his skull I
took good aim and gave him a shot be
tween the eyes that brought him. down as
dead as though he had been a sheep or an
ox. Seeing that the shot had killed the
tiger I ran down to the river, filled my hat
with water and went to work to try to re
store Bob's senses. He had been badly
stunned and was breathing heav
ily, but I saw had no bad wounds
and soon had the satisfaction to
see him open his eyes, when it was not
long before his wits returned and he was
able to sit up. The paw of the tiger had
struck him on the side of the head and
knocked him senseless, but had only
slightly wounded his scalp. The weight
of the tiger on his chest had almost
stopped his breath and he felt some inter
nal soreness. We found that his life had
been saved by a lucky chance. In a game
bag he had slung to his side were some
quail and a pec-fowl or two, and it was
these the tiger had seized upon and
crunched in her blind rage, not Bob's ribs.
"Bob was much astonished and bewil
dered when he saw two dead tigers
strotched out alongside of him. I told
him that he had gone into a sort of de
lirium of rage and killed them both, and
for a time he believed my story. He said
be had an indistinct recollection of hav
ing done a good deal of fighting. We found
that his shot had plowed through the
muscles of the female tiger's left shoul
der, only |}iehtly wounding her, but prob
ably paralyzing her left fore leg.
"When the old shekarry came up with
his crowd of beaters he was at first much
disappointed that we hai killed no deer
Or wild pigs. 'Alas, sahibs,' cried he, 'no
meat â no meat!' He, however, soon
cheered up and took great credit to him
self for having said there were tigers in
the jungle. After the tigers were skinned
we went down the river and killed for the
old fellow quite a lot of pigs. We were
well satisfied with our prizes, the skins of
the two tigers. The male measured, as he
lay on the ground, eleven feet two inches
from tip to tip and the female ten feet
four inches.
"They were unusually large hill tigers,
which are of heavier build than the tigers
of the valleys, but average less in length.
To kill tigers with a pistol was a feat be
fore unheard of on the frontier, and ob
tained for us great credit for nerve, bat

be will go down like a bullock. Many
tigers are killed by single shots from
rifles, bat the man who goes after tigers
on foot must have a considerable amount
of nerve. I could always bet on the nerve
of Brother Bob."
A Chinaman's Queer
Physiognomy.
Yip Hing is a Chinese who can safely
lay claim to having the queerest physiog
nomy of any man in all California. It is
wildiy outlandish and really seems as if
it should belong to the inhabitant of an
other planet.
Yip has his home in Alameda, at one of
the vegetable gardens on the bay shore
not far from Eagle- avenue, but he is an
occasional passenger on the ferry-boats,
and la always sure to attract attention by
his strange combination of features. At a
first glance it would bs a hard matter to
place Yip in his proper place among the
nationalities, for he does not seem to have
any one feature that is not in a class by
i i self.
His nose is strongly aquiline and his
j forehead protrudes very like that of some
white infants. His lips are of an African
character and his chin â well, to tell the
truth, Yip has no chin. His under jaw
simpiy slopes back from his under lip
with only a slight swelling where his
throat ought to be. The eye of this
strange looking man is somewhat like
that of others of his race, but as it hap
pens to be too close to his brow it Jose 3 its

Malay.
The only things that make Yip look
like a Chinaman are his dress and the way
he wears bis hair. These are of the usual
oriental cut, and really make him less
conspicuous than ha would otherwise be.
A Chinese companion of Yip, who
spoke English, volunteered the informa
tion that the strange-looking man was
"on* heap smart boy." He said that Yip
was born in China, of good stock, but
somehow he couldn't learn to speak the
language of this country. He is good at
figures and is well posted on the litera
ture of his own country. In fact it is saM
that he haa had as fine an education as it
is possible for him to get without belong

"What makes Yip look so funny?" was
asked.
"Oh,'* said the interpreter, "that be

Devil want to get Yip, but Yip no want to
go. His mother hang on to him and then
devil hit Yip on head and make he look
different from other boys. That all right.
It give Yip heap good sense and devil
never get him now."

BY HORSE
AND WHEEL.
How a Call Correspondent Went
to the Los Angeles Fiesta and
What Befell Him by
the Wayside*
"Give me ozone and lots of it," I said to
my friend Davie. "There's my band to
seal the compact. We will start on
Thursday."
We were nothing if not original. Other
people might travel by rail, by water, on
foot, on bicycles, on horseback, or any
other old way, but we proposed to effect a
weird and unheard-of combination.
Davie had a horse and bicycle and
I bad $30 to invest. Davie was about to
ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, in
order to participate in the fiesta as one of
the floral bouquets and, naturally enough,
wished to enjoy my company. It was lie,
therefore, that proposed that I should
buy a horse and keep alongside the wheel
for 480 miles, whicn elucidates the open
ing words of this veracious chronicle.
It is true I had never ridden a horse be
fore in my life, if we except the happy
days of childhood, when I occasionally
visited the seaside and allowed a priv-
ileged donkey to throw me over its bead by
way of exercise both for myself and the
donkey. Of course I realize that a donkey
is not a horse, but the principle is the
same.
"A horse, "said Davie didactically, "can
easily cover forty miles a day ana we are
not going to try to lower any record*.
There is no object to be gained by humili
ating one's fellow-creatures. We are sim
ply out for fun and plenty of it."
I will not anticipate the sequel by stat
ing that we got more fan than we bar
gained for. Ignore this parenthetical ob
servation. The next day we set out early
to buy a horse. South of Market street
we were shown half a dozen broncos,
which were to be sola "dirt cheap." My
only publicly expressed motive for declin
ing to purchase was that I hadn't time to
break one. I may add incidentally and
in confidence that I didn't entertain any
healthily developed desire for the bronco
to break me. There are two sides to every
question. Another generously disposed
dealer offered us an overtrained ana
broken â very much broken â animal for
$25. As Mark Twain once said in similar
circumstances it bad many good points,
but as our time was short we did not bang
our bats on one of them.
According to every dealer we visited, a
trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles
would simply amount to a quiet post
prandial constitutional for tbe proffered
Bucephalus. This was particularly so in
the case of an equine veteran with a
I
blind eye, for which the owner wanted
$35â the sale to include saddle and bridle.
But, as I aptly said to Davie, I wasn't
anxious to emulate Don Quixote on an
up-to-date Rozinante and therefor* "de
clined with thanks."
Oar patience was at length rewarded
when we discovered a pretty-looking
mare, priced at $30, with equipment
thrown in. My friend took advantage of
the situation to display bis extensive
technical knowledge, by which the urbane
liveryman seemed suitably impressed. I
have since bad reason to doubt his sin
cerity, but once more I will not anticipate.
In the end I paid the purchase price
and we decided on an early start the fol
lowing morning. When the following
morning at length arrived we were treated
to a practical illustration of the hoary
adage that man proposes and the devil
disposes. Davie's big toe had filed a gen
eral demurrer to the expedition and was
highly inflamed with rage and excite
ment. This in itself was bad enough, but
worse is behind. Owing to t,he fact that
we had previously dispatched all our civ
ilized clothing to Los Ang-ien, we were
forced to live in retirement and study
Plato's "Pbcedo" until Davie's big toe
grew convalescent.
It was only after a long chapter of acci
dents that I remembered that 1 was born
under Saturn and that we started on Fri
day. The urbane liveryman fastened my
packâ a large oneâ behind the saddle and
announced that all was ready. Candor
compels me to confess that at this tre
mendous juncture, exposed to the critical
and merciless gaze of two stablemen and
four small boys, 1 hardly felt so confident
as I had done when studying the
"Phcedo" and chafing at the delay. How
ever, I recalled to mind a family tradition
concerning my great-great-grandfather,
who once rode all the way from Wales to
Manchester, at the early age of 12, and
with a stifled prayer to the centaurs I
placed my left footâ No. 7%â in the stir
rup and swung myself gracefully into the
saddle.
"Get a move on there," roared Davie,
preparing to mount his wheel, "and
'witch the world with noble horseman
ship." 1
Unfortunately the mare, which, by the
way, we had christened Melpomene, ob
jected on general principles to co-operate
in the witching proposition and promptly
fell down before we bad proceeded a hun
dred yards. Fortunately for my insur
ance company and the world generally I
escaped death by a wonderful display of
agility. Tne urbane liveryman, who had
trailed as for this distance, now ran up and
helped Melpomene to rise. The pack had
been displaced by the fall and more valu
able time was consumed in readjusting it.
Once again I mounted and urged Melpo
mene to show her paces.
It is no violation of confidence to state
that we started from a stable on Valencia
street, and after an hour's hard riding I
found myself opposite a saloon on How
ard street, with Davie a mile ahead. Mel
pomene exhibited unmistakable signs of
distress, and providentially lecollecting
that I had joined the Band of Kindness
in my youth I promptly dismounted to
give the mare a rest. What is more I left
| half the contents of the pack in the sa
! loon-keeper's charge, but not before I had
'aggravated his choler" by qnafn.ig a
steam bear. D.iv;Â«\ 1 may say, rejoined
me in time to pool on this issue. A lew
stars, please.
**Â»â¦#Â»#â¦
Thanks! For the third time I mounted
my fiery, untamed steed and turned her
head in the direction of Twenty-fourth
street, which, we were informed, was the
first stage to Los Angeles. The street
railway company could not have foreseen
the possibility ol anybody undertaking to
follow that route on horseback when they
laid their cable-car track, and as I was
born under Saturn the noise of the cable
visibly disconcerted Melpomene. She
neighed "Home, Sweet Home," and tried
to return to her stable. A painful scene
ensued, but the power of the human will
temporarily prevailed and an hour later I
had reacued Twenty-sixth street. Davie,
like the Spanish fleet, was not in sight.
Melpomene insisted upon the propriety of
turning down every side street to cogitate.
"I have an idea that her early youtb
must liavo been spent in a circus, because
she evinced a marked partiality tor cir
cles, which she was able to trace witb the
curbstone as center and any radius. A
sympathetic young man, who had been a
pleased and interested spectator of these
geometrical eccentricities, advised me to
flog Melpomene, and asked me if be
should lend a hand. I told him, how
ever, that I belonged to a band of kindness
and could not conscientiously indorse
sucb a proposal. He seemed burt and
retorted that he would leave me to my
machinations. He did bat not for long.
We reached Redwood City the sam"
evening, Melpomene completely ex
hausted and suffering from me goat i n
her left leg. The beat throughout the
day bad been excessive, and for once in
my life, as the pedals scorched my feet
and the sun taught my face and neck a
redder hue then red, I appreciated the
feelings of St. Lawrence basking upon the
gridiron.
The fact is we were treated with con
tumely by several coarse-minded livery
men, a circumstance whicn puzzled us
considerably until a bystander tnougbt
fuliy informed us that we were taken for
horse thieves!
"We shall have to make San Jose," said
Davie, as we resumed our weary pilgrim
age, "and see if the liverymen there can
recognize a first-class mare when they see
one. This kind of thing is calculated to
give a fellow â "
Here Melpomene wanted to kneel down
and say her prayers and Davie had a nar
row escape from death.
A mile from Redwood City I surrendered
the wheel to Davie and jumped into the
saddle.
Tired as she was Melpomene resented
the extra weight and turned again to Eu
clid for diversion ; bat this time I forgot
all about the band of kindness and re
membered instead the words of Solomon,
"Spare the rod and spoil the mare." We
reached San Jose in the evening, battered
wrecks with th? exception of the wheel.
A friend in need advanced me $10 on the
mare and I bought a second-band wheel,
though the effort almost reduced me to a
condition of insolvency.
We made a Highly auspicious start
from San Jose, albeit my joy at this
happy turn of affairs was somewhat
chastened by the discovery that I had
lost three pairs of socks and half a dozen
hankerchiefs somewhere on the road.
"Then we are lost!" ejaculated Davie,
striking an attitude. "The bloodhounds
will have a snap."
What did he mean ?
Fifteen miles from San Jose and in the
midst of a twenty-niiles-an-hour clip my
handle-bars came off, and so did 1. As I
fell I heard Saturn smtle, and it is an in
disputable iact that I saw more stars than i
one, but thanked none of them. A
friendly rancher fixed up the crippled
wheel with splints and baling rope, and
after a few preliminary tumbles I man
aged to follow in Davie's wake. But tbree
miles of this ruined the combination,
though 1 succeeded in covering another
mile with the handle-bars pointing due
north and south.
The situation will be more readily un
derstood when I add that we were riding
south. We went into caucus three miles
from Gilroy, and with the assistance of a
local wheelman again repaired the crip
pled bike. We thundered into Gilroy
later In the day, and stayed there long
enough to drink a lemonade apiece.
"We must make San Juan this even
ing," said Davie, with confidence, and I
cheerfully assented, forgetting for the
moment my baleial horoscope. Saturn,
however, refused to be propitiated and
six miles from Gilroy my handle bars
again parted company from the fork and
I parted company from the saddle. Davie
regretted that he bad forgotten his kodak
â a regret I did not share.
We quite enjoyed the romantic walk to
Gilroy. The telegraph wires played selec
tions from Chopin's funeral march and
"When Johnny Comes Marching Home,"
but we were not to be bluffed.
The chapter of accidents virtually ends
at Gilroy, where we had the wheel
strongly repaired. It is true we were
compelled to take the boat from
Port Harford to San Pedro, travel
ing steerage in the elevating com
piny of negroes, Chinamen and
cockroaches, but though we were starved
for twenty-four hours and the captain and
the purser logically sustained the ominous
tenor of our trip by shooting seagulls, the
narrative of our adventures during this
part of our jonrney cannot be said to
possess public interest. I maivel that we
are still alive. My wheel and a goldon
hair from Me pomene's mane are now on
view at the Park Museum.
My neighbor, the farmer, went through
his orchards the other day popping away
with a shotgun at the small birds dis
porting themselves among the trees. I
am sure he was under the impression
that he was saving his crop, but I glanced
at the trees as I drove by and saw more
than one gossamer neÃt from which, in a
week or so, more worrcs will have hatched
than he can possibly tind birds enough to
devour. They will cost him more cherries
than all the birds on the mountainside
could rob him of, and the burden of de
stroying them will be heavier, far, than
that of carrying about a pan, taking futile
aim at the tuneful little friends who are
only too glad to protect his trees, if he
will but let them.
We nave none too many birds to do this
for us, and those we have are in danger of
being exterminated by the onward march
of civilization. Most even of our seed
eating birds seem to be insect-destroyers
at certain seasons of the year. The little
tiiistle bird, sometimes called the Califor
nia canary, but who is rightfully the
American goldfinch, is a capital illustra
tion of this. Early in the springtime
these birds may be seen feasting upon the
fluffy seeds of the willows. They make
their appearance with their blossoming
and continue with us until late in the au
tumn.
As summer advances we see them in
great flocks on the thistles and among the
tarweed eating the seeds, but just now
they are rearing their young broods upon
insects. We may watch them circling
about in the air, from morn till dewy eve,
catchlne these and carrying them to their
nests to poke into the yawning, clamorous
bills of baby birds. Even the California
linnet, toe mischievous little crimson
beaded bouse finch, does his share toward
keeping ravaging insects in check, bat it
must be confessed his depredations among
the fruit, a little later on, will sorely try
the soul of the orchardist. The bouse
finch is a pretty bird and a sweet, continu
ous singer, but as a neighbor he is, to my
mind, far more objectionable than the
despised English sparrow.
He seems to be even more quarrelsome
than the sparrow. He is noisy and un
tidy. A pair of linnets nesting, as they
are fond of doing, under the eaves' of a
house porch, will keep the floor littered
the season through with grass roots,
sticks, leaves and a general assortment of
rubbish that, if allowed to accumulate,
would make a great pile before summer
passed. The male bird has a trick of
bringing this stuff long after the nest is
finished and the eggs laid by his practical
little mate, who wastes no time in such
nonsense. If I were making a list of
birds that should be exempted from pro
tection I think I should head it with the
name of this finch.
Nearly equal to him in capacity for
mischief is the cherry bird, or cedar wax
wing, a bird that has until within the
past few years been comparatively rare in
this State, but whicb is becoming all too
common in some orchard sections. I
fancy most orchardists would wish to add
to this list the sapsuckers and wood
peckers, and I am not sure but that son>e
of these are sufficiently predaceous to
merit the disfavor with which they are
regarded. The sapsucker in our citrus
belts has developed a wonderful fondness
for the sap of the oranee tree, and to get
this they bore rings of little holes about
the trunks of trees and drink the drops as
V ey flow.
A sapsucker will completely girdle a
tree with these holes and soon cause its
death. They are readily disposed of by
injecting a little strychnine and honey
into the holes they make. As they re
turn to these from time to time they are
pretty certain not to miss the fatal dose.
Perhaps the larger owls and hawks do
damage enough to justify warfare against
them, but the owner of a squirrel-infested
field may well look upon these birds ms
his friends; and the sad- voiced littl*
screech-owl, with his humorously pa
thetic visege, is worth his weight in gold
about a barn. He is lar more useful than
a cat for clearing the place of vermin.
Sentiment causes us to look askance at
the shriek, whose name, butcher-bird, is
supposed to express his cruel, blood
thirsty nature, but the butcher-bird is
comparatively rare. With a fairly alert
pair of eyes, where birds are concerned, I
have only seen one during this season and
the last. He is, moreover, useful in kill
ine fieldmice and gophers, and while we
cannot call him a lovable bird he certainly
does no evil that would justify us in ex
terminating him. I question whether the
circumstance of his killing little birds
justifies our hatred of him â the small boy
often does that with far less excuse.
Bat the jays and magpies should be
given no quarter. Even the handsome
coat cannot blind us to the fact that tbe
California bluejay is an arrant rascal, a
cowardly, blustering, cruel thief, preying
indifferently upon orchard, chicken-yard
and songbird's nest. The road-runners,
queerest ot all California birds, are nften
accused of being a menace to young
chickens and eggs, but on the other hand
they are remarkably useful in keeping
down ground squirrels and gophers.
They prey, also, upon the lizards and
little snakes which we can ill afford to lose
from our fields and garden;. But the fact
that the road-runner will attack and Kill
both tbe raKler and the corral snake makes
him a useful member of society in some
sections.
I suspect that the mischief done by the
red-shafted flicker, or high-hole, apainst
which our country boys are encouraged
to do battle, is preatiy exaggerated. The
California woodpeckers trick of burying
acorns is a mischievous one when it leads
him to riddle housetops for this purpose.
We sometimes come upon trees wit i the
bark literally honeycombed with these
holes, but I have never seen the flicfcer at
work thus, nor am I at all certain that
he does anything of the Â«ort. He is an
insectivorous bird, who picks up his food
for the most part from the ground and
makes no especial provision for winter, at
does his near relative, the golden- shafted
flicker of the Eastern coast. The Cali
fornia woodpecker, on the other hand,
does gather and bury acorns for future
use. I have known one to plant a score or
more in the shingles of a roof, wedding
them in so tightly as to render them
almost immovable, but I never saw one
return to devour any of this hoarded store.
Most of us act as though we thonght
there was real virtue in decrying the Eng
llsb sparrow; and it must be admitted
that he is not altogether an agreeable
bird, but he has done untold good in this
country in ridding our trees of predaceous
worms and insects. Adelimk Kkapi>,SUICIDES' GRAVES
AT MONTE CARLO
In only one place in the world does a graveyard devoted entirety
to suicides exist. This is at Monte Carlo, the only place in the
world where a special graveyard for suicides could be necessary.
Many travelers deny that there is one even there, but there is. Its
location is not easy to find. It is not desired by the Monte Carlo
people that it be found at all by any one save old Gilbert, the
mysterious charac er who attends to it. This is, so far as is known,
the first article on oli Gilbert that has appeared in an American
newspaper. The accompanying picture of him was drawn from life
Probably you have heard of the sui- |
cides* cemetery at Monte Carlo, but the j
chances are that you have never heard of j
the man who digs the graves there. Very I
few perions have. Nevertheless he has
been one of the paid attaches of the insti
tution for many years â ever since its
foundation, he says.
Various travelers nave denied the exist
ence of this graveyard, but it does exist
and is not hard to find â after you know
where to look for it.
Do not expect to find it near the grounds
of t&e beautiful palace, where the sound
of the whirring ball mingles with the
Chink of goid. Ask neither the croupiers
aor the porters about it. They will only
iraile incredulously and shak* their heads.
Do not expect anybody about Monte Carlo
to tell you where it is. Nobody will do so.
Guidebooks do not mention itâ the in-
Biitution looked cut for that.
Dut go to the old priest in Monaco and
i Â»sk him where his cemetery is. He will
X tell you gladly.
It is about three miles from the gam
bHng-hcuse, and bronze gntes open to it
from the beautiful drive. Go right through
tfiis cemetery and climb the hill behind
where graves are few. You will come to
a rough stone wall, and if you look care
fully will ti ad a gate through it that leads
to. a rough, stony path. Up this path
about 300 feet is a rude stone dwelling,
built partly into the hillside. Here lives
Gilbert, the gravedigger of the suicides'
cemetery, and he knows all about the
place;â more than any other man living
and more than he wiil ever tell.
The suicides' cemetery it in reality part
of the cemetery of Monaco, but has been
detached from it, as suicides may not be
buried in consecrated ground.
The necessities which called for its
creation were the unknown suicides that
the institution could not permit to be
buried in the potters' field. Consequently
a place was found for them where they
eoula be buried cntii claimed by relatives.
Any marked clothing or token that might
lead to identification is hied away in a
special room in the gambling-house and
labeled with the number of the nameless
grave. But all the bodies that hare been

[Drawn from life.]
Interred in the suicides' cemetery have
remained undisturbed.
The man who has charge of this grew
pome place is known as Gilbert. If be
haÂ° any other name he keeps it to him
self. Where he first saw the light of day
is a mystery. He claims to be French,
but has more the appearance of an Italian
or a fcpaniard. He speaks the three lan
guages perfectly, and has a smattering of
English.
Gibert appears to be about 80 years of
B<re, but is strong and wiry and climbs
over the mountains with ttie ease of a
young man. For his services in caring
for and digging graves for unknown sui
cides he gets his bouse rent free, his food
tupplies and 120 francs every three months.
*'I am the greatest man in the world,"
Bald old Gilbert in describing himself.
"Ail these forty graves I have dug mysell.
'Â± atj are all mine and so are the people in
themâ all mine.
"â 1 spend my days herÂ«, and sometimes
my nights. When another friend is ready
to come and sleep in my bous> they send
for me and Igo bring them. Forty brave
people have I buriÂ«d, sirâ thirty-seven man
and three women. And they sleep sound
âah, so sound!
'It is so long since I dug the first grave
over in the corner that I almost forget.
But I remember it was a young manâ an
Englishman. He tose aJI and shoot him; j
fcelf through the heart. He was a brave
man and well deserves to sleep in this
beautiful place.
T "The ladies? No; they were not beau
tiful, nor young. Ugly, mean looking. All
of them took poison.
"O-ne man who killed himself bad Â£100 !
in hs pocket. He had not been playing, j
but just killed himself in the beautiful I
park for some reason of his own. He is
there in No. 20."
Old Gilbert leaned on tbe handle of his
eno'vel ana lookel across tbe blue waters of
hi Mediterranean at OA*-of the most beau
tifnl sights on the face of the earth.
"What matters it how a man leaves the
world? ' he said in perfect Italian. "When
his time comes he will no and not before."
"Don't tell me that tnere is no knowl
edge of what is to be. In some book,
somewhere, It is wr.tten where you and I
will go. The place where we will sleep is
marked. What matters it to know where
it is. It may be here in this peaceful spot ;
it may be in the wilds of Africa. We may
go to-morrow and we may not go for
years.
"See," said the old man, going to the I
edge of an open grave, "this is ready for j
somebody. Who? Ii may be me; it may j
be you. It may be somebody thousands i
of miles away at this moment. But no
matter who, the person for whom I dug j
the grave will occupy it and nobody else.
"Ttaia is noi consecrated ground, you .
say? Wluit matters that? Do not tbey j
who bravely ended their own lives sleep as ;
soundly here as those in the other place 1
on the hillside below us? I know they j
do, and tne wind whispers just as sweetly j
through the tree? here as there. They are !
happy and at rest.
"Am I happy? Certainly. Have I not j
all that I can ask? Am I not doing good !
in the world? This is my duty, and it is |
written that I must do it, and I must. I
am a great man.
'We cannot guide our own lives any
more than we can cuide the ball that
whirls in the roulette wheel. All life is
written, but to us it must appear as only
chance. We love chance and stake our
lives on it. If we win, we are happy. If
we lose, we weep; or like my friends asleep
here end our lives bravely.
"Was not the young Englishman who
killea himself a brave man? Think of
the trouble he may have saved others.
He left Home to travel, and his passion
went with him. He cocid not help it ; his
passion was born in him. His people
tnought he was traveling tbrougfl art
naileries and churches. Instead, he was
gambling away his money at Monte Carlo.
"He staked his all on the roll ol the
wheel and 10-t. That meant rum. dis
grace and endless trouble for bis relatives.
By shooting himself he ended everything
and now sleeps peacefully. When bii
relatives did not hear from him they made
inquiry in many places. But not at Monte
Carlo. Oh, no. He was of their
flesh and would not venture near
such a place. So they conclude the poor
boy was foully murdered for his money
and revere his memory as if he were a
martyr. It is best so. They have their
cherished memories â he sleeps peacefully
in my house."

Mythical Fortunes.
Every now and then paragraphs appear
in the papers telling how some hitherto ob
j scure and usually proverty-stricken person
I has unexpectedly fallen heir to a fortune
left him by some relative in foreign lands.
The estate in question is invariably large,
j so that even if the newly discovered heir is
1 entitled to but a part, that share is enough
* to make him a Cicesns. among his humble
neighbors- . â¢ Bui. somehow the account
i never gets so far as- to describe an actual
i. taking possession of .-the fortune; it i* re
i lated that this proceeding is delayed only
j until certain formalities have been com
plied with, or until he crosses the Atlan
tic, or until the next steamer arrives and.
brings him the titles . to the property, but
| lor some reason he sinks immediately into
j his former obscurity, and if h>? really gets
i the money the public never hears of it.
! It is probable that such tales arc some
{ times put into circulation by crafty per
! sons engaged in prosecuting so-cailed
claims against other mythical estates of
fabulous value in order that the hopes of
the victims may be stimulated; but when
; they have, a foundation in truth the
chances are that the property inherited
amounts to little compared with the im
posing tigure3 published. - . . .
As showing how such things are exag
gerated, a case just reported from a
Pennsylvania town is in point. In this
instance the estate is on this side of the
Atlantic and the claimants on the other,
and is that of a deceased Hungarian, who
migrated to this country some years ago.
He was industrious and frugal, and, be
fore he died, was classed by his simple
minded neighbors as wealthy. Tha re
port grew as it traveled, and his heirs in
the old country heard that he Jeft large
manufactories and property valued at
$4,000,000. "Eminent lawyers" were en
gaged to look after the matter, and
they, by correspondence with the Consul
at Philadelphia, have learned that the
reputed millionaire left an estate val
ued at exactly $1715, oi which $907 is un
collectible.
The castles built by tbe expectant Hun
garian relatives will fall with a crash when
they get tins news, and their Jast estate
will indeed be worse than their first, for
$808, the collectible balance, will hardly
surlice to pay the eminent lawyers for their
trouMe in lidding irnw little money there
is. Possibly, however, their hopes will be
sustained by the belief, cunningly instilled
by "promoters," that they are being de
ceived and the estate really exists and be
longs to them. In this case they should
have the sympathy and encouragement
of Anneke Jans' heirs, who have allowed
themselves to be deceived for so long that
they rather like the experience and are
wil.ing to pay lberally for it, even though
there is not $808 in sight at the end of the
rainDow. â Indianapolis Journal.
LOADING SHIPS BY TROLLEY ON THE COAST OF MENDOCINO.
SHIP-LOADING
BY TROLLEY.
Imagine the spectacle of a ship
having its cargo seat to it from
land along a trolley wire, as your
purchases in the dry-goods stores
are sent swinging along overhead
to the cashier's desk. That is how
ships are loadei along the inacces
sible coasts of Mendocino, as the
following article graphically sets
forth by thz a d of photographs*
In tbe jrreat rtdwood inmbering in
dustry of Northern California one may
: ].<i v.r-.y Mart in-.; innovations in the
application of machinery and mechanical
power to the operations. The employ,
ment of cable railroads in getting the
logs or raw mateiial out of the forest, as
described recently in The BOVBAT Call, is
one of these novelties, but what is per
haps equally novel 13 the use of trolley
systems for loading the finished product
(lumber) into vessels on the seacoast.
These troliey systems are in general use
on the coast of Mendocino Countyâ a
county that has more seaports and lewer
harbors than any other in the StP.te.
From end to end its coast in doited with
sawmills, anil each one is a shipping point
in Itself, yet not one can boast of anything
more than an open roadstead for a harbor.
At a few of the ports the nature of the
coasc has permitted the building of
wharves out into the ocean, alongside of
winch, in calm weather, vessels may lie,
and while rising and falling with the
ocean swell, have their cargoes lowered
aboard by derricks on the \Tharf. Most of
the ports, however, have not even this
small advantage, and where there is a
wharf it is usually a high structure built
out over some reef of rocks which vessels
dare not approach too closely, in many
instances there is no sign ol a wnari, the
lumber for shipment being taken to some
high projecting bluff, whence it must be
lowered to the vessel bobbing about in
the ocecn below.
These last described ports are called
"landings," which is evidently a misno
mer, for in the common acceptance cf the
term a vessel never "lands" at one of
tnem. O;i the contrary, the mariner's
chief concern is to keep as far away from
the "landing" as possible, and accordingly
his vessel comes to anchor several hun
dred /eel away from the wharf or bluff.
But the vessel's anchors are not to be re
lied on alone to keep her from going
ashore, and, therefore, to make her posi
tion more secure, mooring lines are car
ried out in nil directions and fastened to
spar buoys provided for that purpose and
(irmly anchored in suitable positions.
Sometimes as many as s:x moorinp. lines,
extending la as many different directions,
are required to makeJhe vessel secure and
keep her in the position best suited lor
taking on her cargo.
In former years vessels were loaded at
the3e "landings" by means of a long
chute, lowered from the wharf or biuff, to
the vessel's deck and down whicii the
lumber was slid piece by piece. But this
was not only slow, but dangerous owing
to the necessarily near approach of tbe
vessel and the possiDility of fouling the
chute. Now, the vessel, while riding at
her moorings at a sufer distance from the
rocky shore, receives her cargo in sling
loads oi 2000 feet or more by means of a
troiley traveling over a wire cube
r-tretched between her ana the shore sev
eral hundred feet away. And by the
same means, using a large box or cradle,
passengers are transferred to and from the
shore.
In rigging the trolley for use all of the
work is done aboard the vessel and the
maintenance of the cable in position is en
tirely under control of the crew. This is
made possible by having the cable in two
parts and making tug only two fastenings
necessary witn triphookj. Neitner part
of the cable is in evidence when the ves
sel arrive;?, one part being at the bottom
of the ocean, with an end securely an
chored, while the other part, with the
trolley apparatus, is safely stored in the
little donkey engine house standing at
the end of tne wharf or perched on top of
the bluff. The part in the water is usually
about 200 feet long, and as the vessel comes
up to the landing she picks up its loose
end. the position of which is marked by a
buoy.
The lumber to be shipped from these
"landings" 'â¢ arrives from the mill on cars,
each car carrying about 20D0 feet of
boards, so pile.l that sling ropes may be
passed around the load. All that is neces
sary then is tc-r.un the car under the cabje,
fasten the sling ropes and attach ihem to
the traveler hook, and with a pull or two
from the endless cable the load slides off
the car and starts on its way to the vessel.
ArrivinE there, it is lowered to the deck
by lowering the cable from the freight
boom, and while it is beine stowed away
the trolley is returning for another car
ioad. In this way l."> 0,000 feet, of lumber
can be transferred in a day, which amoun t
represents a fair cargo for one of the sail*
ing schooners and about naif of that car
ried by the steam schooners.

Chances for Success.
In solving "Problems of Young Men"
Edward W. Bofc, in the Ladies' Home
Journal, replying 10 an inquirer, contends
that opportunities for promotion (in busi
ness) are more numerous in large cities
than in smaller communities, but they
are not better. "There are more chances
in the larger cities, but likewise there are
many more applicants for the chances.
Salaries may be higher in the centers, Lv
so, too, is the cost of livine. Things al
ways equal z* themselves. To my way of
thinking, :i moderate business success in
a small community means more to a man
in point of living and absolute satisfac

city."
DEATH MASK OF
EMPEROR NAPOLEON
It has just become known that one of the most valuable Napo
leonic relics in existence is in the possession of J. M. Woolworth, an
attorney of Omaha, Nebr. It is nothing less than one of the five
casts taken from the original death mask made by Dr. Francois An
tomarchi, physician to Napo!eon lat the lime of his death. This cast,
which is of bronze, is one of five that were made from the original
mask as soon as Cr, Antomarchi returned to France. Shortly atter it
was finished it disappeared as completely as i: it had beea thrown
into the sea, and aii efforts to find it until now hayÂ» proved fru.thss.
The history of this cast is one of ex
ceeding interest. It has always been
known that five casts were taken from the
mask, but what became of the fifth was,
until the existence of the cast in the pos
session of Mr. Woolworth became known,
a mystery of whose solution there seemed
to be no hope. There ia not the slightest
doubt of its genuineness, for there is ample
proof at hand to prove" it to be just what
it is represented. It is owned by Captain
Guy Howard, U. S. A., to whom it was
presented by Dr. C. MacMsnus of Matamo
ras, Mex.. in March, 1892. The accom
panying illustrations will show to the
student of Napoleon that here is a treasure
snch as no one dreamed existed in the
Western hemisphere.
Dr. Francois Antomarchi was the phy
sician who closed the eyes of the great
leader of Frenchmen when death finally
claimed him at the isle of Elba. Dr.
Antomarchi had been a devoted adherent
of the Little Corporal, and when life had
left him determined that there should be
a correct representation of his features. As
a consequence the deatb mask was taken.
Dr. Antomarchi was :oo patriotic to wish
to confine the possession of a correct cast
of Napoleon's features to himself. There
fore, he caused to be made from it five
bronze casts. Four of these speedily found
owners. The fifth cast seemed to vanish,
no one knew where. In 1836 Dr. Anto
marchi left France and came to the New
World, visiting New Orleans and the
Mexican republic.
Months were spent in traveling about
the land of the Montezumas, among other
places visited being the mining towns of
Guadalupe y Calvo and Guanecevi, in
the States of Chihuahua and Durango.
Here he was attracted by having read the
stories of travels written by Hum bboltd t
and Ward, who, at the end of the first
third of the present century, did more
than all el-e to make famous Wat we all
Know now as Mexico. Dr. Mac Manns,
who presented the cast in the possession
of Mr. Wool wort n to Captain Howard, is
particularly well informed on the subject.
Like the treat French doctor, Humboldt
and Ward's narratives were what attracted

marchi's visit to that section of the Ameri
can continent Dr. MacManus says:
"Dr. Antomarchi was well received
when be visited Mexico. At the town of
Guadalupe y Calvo he was leted by Wash
ington Kerr of Baltimore and by the very
liberal cosmopolitan population, famous
for its hospitality. The doctor, upon bis
arrival at Guanecevi, not far from Batopo
las, stopped at the hov:se ol 1) n Antonio
Calleros, my father-in-iatv. lion Antonio
was a miner, keen, shrewd ana well ectu
cated. He was a!s> an enti usiastic ad
mirer of Napoleon and a strong friend
ship consequently sprang up between
him and Dr. Antomarchi.
"The country in that section of Mexico
is exceedingly mountainous, and the
Indians were very hostile to travelers at
the time at which tiie episodes of which I
write occurred. Dr. Antomarchi had
three trunks, or boxes, which were very
heavy and difficult to trÂ»n>port on the
packmules, which formed the only method
of freighting in that country. It became
evident that only two of these boxes, or
trunks, could be taken by the doctor on
his journey, and so he left the third in
the custody of Don Antonio. The doctor
and his escort then set out for the city of
Durango, where they were the guests of
Judge Braclio. a learned lawyer of that
place. Here they remained fnr several
months, the doctor being constantly
solicited to practice his profession. But
he was so thoroughly imbued with Na
poleonic histo-y and legend that he and
his companion as well would neither at
tend to nor talk of anything else.
"All effort to itidacs the doctor to c n
gage in labor proved fruitless, and after a
time he and his companion journeyed on
ward to Mexico City and from there to
the Huasteca Vera Cruz, where both be
came ill with malarial fever. After a
time they recovered, and then, during the
last of March, 1838, the doctor and his
companion, Ualieros, separated, the latter
returning to his home at Guanecevi.
while the former saile .l for Cuba. It was
Dr. Antomarchi's last voyage. He died at
sea and was buried off Ban Antonio, the
west cape of Cuba, April 3, 1838.
"For many years after Dr. Antomarchi's
death the great box that he had left in Don
Antonio's custody remained unopened.
In fact, Don Antonio never opened it.
After his deatb, it was deemed advisable
to investigate the contents of the box*
which was done, and everything that was
found taken to San Miguel Durango, after
which they came into my possession.
What was my amazement to find among
them a cast made from the famous death
mask of Napoleon, and accompanying it
were letters and other aocuments proving
its genuineness beyond all question.
"Being something of a student of Napo
leonic literature, I at once realized tbe
value of the discovery, although I made
no special effort to spread the news of
my find. In these days of fictitious relics,
t is well worth one's while to take every
precaution that he may thoroughly prove,
if necessary, the genuineness of that
which he claims to be a relic of great value.
This is what I have done with the cast of
the Napoleon death mask."
The discovery of this cast and its final
location show conclusively how little cre
dence there is to be placed in mar.y of toe
minor theories which the alleged histo
rians of Napoleon have hastened to ad
vance about the missing cast, now no
longer missing. Various persons haTe
been charged with its theft. It was sol
emnly averred tnat one very well known
personage, with a hatred for all things
Napoleonic, stole tbe almost priceless
treasure from the home of an acquaint
ance and destroyed it for the avowed rea
son that be believed tbe hated face of tbe
dead leader should bo effaced from mem
ory, if possible, instead of belug perpet
uated.
There is no relic in the United States of
Napoleon, so those who are in authority
to upealc say, which equals this. It is
likely that some day it will lind its way
into the custody of one of the great his
torical museums of '.he United Slates. In
fact, a movement to that end is already in
progress. â¢

some form or other trimmings musi ap
pear on our skirts, and if flounces are not
to our likin? we can have insertions, vel
vet, silk or satin ribbons employed. Some {
of tne prettiest of skirts are those having
pored pieces, guileless of fullness, flounced
to the waist. Such models absorb enor
mous quantities of material, which should
be of the best organdy or muslin, and no
novice in the art of dressmaking should
attempt to handle them. Besides are
skirts which really have the appearance of
the coachman's capes, set one over the
other, with raw edges, and also munh in
vogue is thÂ» triple skirt, and as it is
stitched round the laps, at tbe knees and
tbe hem it is far easier to make up success
fully and quite as becoming to some
figures as the other styles.
Tfce Use of Pique
Is on the increase by the great dress
makers, as you can readily judge when I
tell you that it is being used as a founda
tion for the most elaborate embroideries
of jet ana colored silks. One correspon
dent says, writing from Paris: "I saw an
entire front of a bodice made of pique;
but it only appeared as tbe foundation, for
it was worked all over a jour with jet and
gold thread, but intermixed, as far as
trimming was concerned, with white satin.
At the back this was liberally trimmed
with bands of point lace, and the high
collar was supported by bows of green
ribbon, the sleeves having white satin
epaulettes and cuffs, turning back from
the hand, covered with lace, a row of
white buttons fastening the bodice on
the left side."
A bright girl could make something
quite unusually stylish and fetching by
acting on tbe suggestion given in these
few lines, aud indeed those who are clever
with their needles are in numerous cases |
providing themselves with exquisite bits }
of embroidery to be completed during the I
many hours that would otherwise be â 
wasted at our summer resorts.
Casftmere.
For the past year this fabric has been
steadily gaining in favor among our Dest
diessed women, for it not only makes ud
into excellent coats tnat fit and define the I
tigure far better tnan did ever lace cloth
or any other sort of cloth, but, besides, it
nangs beautifully as a skirt, and can be '
braided with great effectiveness. Numer
ous are the summer dresses ot this mate
rial, and the most elaborate have inser- |
tions set a jour of lace designs.
A word about the sac jacket. At last j
the tailors are learning how to cut it {
properly, and now are to be seen those i
, that convey only a suggestion of loose- j
i nes?, for in reality they fit the figure i
j closely, and are most becoming when j
| tabbed round the waist.
The artistic little jacket at present being
worn by Ellen Terry in "Mme. San Gene"
has created quite a sensation. It is green
in color and has a glittering fringe that
just reaches the waist line. This is worn
with an ample skirt of a soft fine buff |
cloth. The style is most becoming to
Miss Terry's figure, it being set in innum
merable gathers around the waist. Such I
! a skirt is especially suitable for tall,
slender women, but the number of yards of
material required for its evolution is sim- i
ply appalling. However, we can readily
understand the charms possessed by tliis !
model when worn with a perfectly light I
bodice that is laced down the back. Such
a dress made of a most superior quality of
! cream white satin, worn with a fichu of
j rare lace with sleeves that fit closely
j edged with lace frills, furnishes a model
we would do well to contemplate.
Jin Evening Bonnet.
For a decided brunette imagine the
charms of an evening bonr.et made oi
gold embroidery, very open, which shows
a rich crimson lining. A rucne of scarlet
tulle edges it, and at one side of the
quaint crown are scarlet wings, fastened
with a loveiy diamond ornament.
The *ariy Victorian fashion of wide
white ribbon bonnet-strings is said to be
most becoming. As a result an attempt is
being made to have them worn.
Cycling .Hats
< Are many of tliem made of the finest
I pedal straw, and the Panama hats, which
were worn last year by men, are being re
produced for the benefit of their wives and
daughters, in many colors.
A new shape called me 1897 has in ad
dition to the crown a curious bisetu
that is a sort of rounded channel, which
! unites the crown and the brim. The
! crowns of many of th* manilla aud Java
cycling hats are surrounded with broad
bands of velvet. In fact, every one can
suit herself, so great is the variety
offered.
Veils.
Speaking of hats reminds me that
only 30, (XX) dots go to every meter (3!i
inches) of the latest importation of
French veiling. Naturally it will be in
jur.ous to tne eyes, so it is pood news
j that the ci>iffon veiling without figures is

so equally becoming that it is to be more
fashionable than ever, but the market will
he flooded with new devices and combina
tions, woven borders and edgings being
numerous. The veilings that are com
posed of two colors, one apparently woven
over the other, have arrived in this City.
They ahve many dots.

Chit-Chat.
Beveral of our belles, who are busily
preparing their trousseaux, worry not a
little oyer the marking of their under
linen and napery. One who has but two
initials is having them worked on her
towels and napkins in plain raised satin
stitch; they stand side by aide and are
quite small. Another has selected larger
letters that are interlaced in an artistic
but rather complicated manner; these are
worked with both solid and open-laced
stitches.
Some alto like for their table-cloths,
sheets and pillowcases extremely large
monograms; these are placed either in the
center of the table-cloths, or in one cor
ner. However, individual taste should be
exercised if satisfactory results are ex
pected. One artistic fiancee has designed
all the models by which her linen is to be
marked, and very beautiful will be the re
sult.
The smart New York girls are having
either their crests or their initials embroid
ered most exquisitely on their corset
covers, just over their hearts, and on their
petticoats, just below the yoke, on the left
side.
Belts are richer than ever this season,
and some have two rows of ornamental
buttons. Black satin and black moire, as
well as the rich-looking fieur de soie, are
in vogue, as all realize that a dark belt
reduces, apparently, the size of tbe waist.
Belts of hand-carved leather are used for
outing wear.
Very fetching are tome of the shirt
waists of mull, over which is worn a tiny
bolero, with a large ruffle at the shoulder.
This style of bolero is described as being
three storiedâ the ruffle counts as the
first, the second is of white lace and the
third of the figured mull. One such dress
is creamy mull sprayed with lovely
blue rose buds, with their foliage. Both
collar and sash were of blue and buff rib
bon, and bad large loops and proportion
ate ends. This gown is owned by an ex
tremely slender young girl, and built en
tirely over buff satin, and is not an expen
sive frock, although very fair aatin is be
ing sold for only 50 cunts a yard in this
City.
In spite of the fact that we are con
stantly informed that a natural waist is
more fashionable than a wasp-iike one, all
dressmakers and tailors, continue to give
the lone slender lines and as small a waist
as possible. Tbe lines of braids in many
of the latest jackets drew my attention to
this fact, as tuey are cleveny arranged to
taper in at the waist and broaden out
over the shoulder. Women should remem
ber that to have a jacket abnormally tight
at the waist will not make their figures
any smaller and a good titter always al
lows an abundance of room above the
bust. Marcella.
NEW YORK NOTES.
We are going back to the fashions of onr
grandmothers in hats; that i.Â«, the fash
ions that were popular with them when
they were girls. The date of the particu
lar style of headgear which we must culti
vate is 1830, and really these arrangements
of the oia-time milliners are so pretty it
quite reconciles us to forget that they are
not the latest ideas of the milliners of
Paris.
In modified forms these hats are being
made with colored straw, jampot crowns
and brims of white or black drawn tulle,
which affect the empire shape, and are
finished off with a ruche at the edge. The
quaintness they give to youthful faces is
only rivaled by the eloquence of their ap
ance for elderly women. As yet the prin
cess bonnet is as little seen as the princess
dress; but solemn assurances are given
that it is only being "held back" for the
time being.
The new shaded millinery in delicious.
There are crowns of violet velvet with
brims of fancy mauve straw trimmed with
shaded stocks or feathery branches of lilac.
The freshest of greens coquette with each
other in many of the hats, toned by
gerbes of shaking black velvet oats on
fine green stems. Rose, coral and poppy
reds would give fascinating effects if one
were only sure that they would not grow
common in time. Coarse yellow and
"burnt" straws show qnaint little Louis-
Seize knots of wired narrow velvet ribbon
and clumps of field flowers, while the
Leghorn contiue to be resplendent with
nodding white plumes and half wreaths
of roses resting on the hair. In a more
sedate style might be mentioned an Em
pire Leghorn hat lined with black satin
and trimmed with black ostrich plumes
and variegated roses.
Black and white mixtures are promi
nent, and many of the new tailor-made
dresses have waistcoats of white vel-

a charming model.
veteen spotted with black. A practical
"front" may be made of white accordion
China silk trimmed with narrow Valen
ciennes lace. If a jeweled belt in worn
with this any colored ribbon may form a
"stock," or a bow of cream lace may re
place it when a change is desirable. Very
narrow black lace is often seen on the
white, pink or lemon accordion vests, and
very pretty they look. The jeweled zones
must be really good to look anything but
vulgar. Tlie best way is to have a special
design made and properly carried out by
a good firm of jewelers.
In Paris coats are much worn, while
here the mantle struggles lor supremacy.
As a compromise between the two there
is the sarque, and one recently seen is well
worthy of description in detail.
Red is to much in favor this year that
sets of lingerie are being prepared all in
red, such as underpetticoats for red surah
and overpetticoats of red taffetas orsatin
ette. There also chemises and drawers of
red coral or surah. A pattern underskirt
is of red Surah with small pleats, the over
petticoat of taffetas plisse soleil, with four
small flounces scalloped. This, of course,
is a fantastic novelty, as it is difficult to
imagine any refined and elegant woman
discarding her fine baptiste and lace
garments.
At this season of the year, with the
merry twinkle or" wedding bells so close at
hand, the brides must not be forgotten.
A very pretty idea for bridal costumes is
to have the wedding dress trimmed with
festoons of beautiful flowers, which are
allowed to droop from the waist, like the
garlands of long ago, pansios and roses
and forget-me-nots being very often
blended together. Then the whole cos
tume is veiled with one of the new possa
mers, so delicate and diaphanous as to
show the daintiness beneath, and the
effect is simply charming.
A novel'y of a more practical kind is
the puzzle lock bracelet, the chain of
which is secured by a lock formed of three
revolving pieces engraved with figures or
letters. Only by arranging these in some
particular combination forming a private
coda can the lock be opened, and as the
figures may make an immense number of
combinations the "open sesame" is well
nigh impossible of attainment except by
the owner.
The idea of this device is that the brace
let ran be taken off and used to chain a
bicycle to the railings while the rider is
in a house or store, as a fattening to a
traveling-bag and for many other pur
poses of the sort.
Most people would be apt to suffer
qualms of anxiety in leaving it as a lock
to a bicycle but for the maker's assurance
that these bracelets, which are made in a
variety of designs, are so strong as to
render the length of time required for
tiling them through a risk which the
bicycle- thief would not venture to incur,
while it is impossible to break the lock or
to open it in any other way than by the
mysterious code
BOYS AND GIfiLS A CENTURY AGO
Are Those of To-Day Better or Even
Happier?
It is the commonplace of the day to
congratulate our children on their singu
lar good fortune in having been born some
sixty years later than their grandparents,
says the Quarterly Review. If compara
tive luxury with far greater indulgences
be an unmixed good there is no denying
the proposition. Whether they are bet
ter, or even happier, are questions less
easily answered. The old-fashioned < is
cipline was one of Spartan severity â for
obvious reasons. Children were treated
neither better nor worse than their fathers
and mothers before them. It may be
worth while to glance at the contrasts be
tween those ascetic times and the present.
Social and domestic England bad changed
but little since t c Revolution. Commu
ncation, no doubt, l>ad greatly improved,
but it was still siow, costly and precarious!
Isolation, even in considerable towns, was
the prevailing rule, nnd the remoter coun
try districts were shrouded in benighted
darkness.
The metropolis was a city sui generis,
and the Londoner was regarded with awe
by the rustics as a foreigner of strange ex
periences. There were no railways to in
stiirate a craving for perpetual movement
The snor'pst journey was a matter of *-eri
oua thought, and not to be undertaken
lightly. For days on the great roads the
intending traveler might have to wait for
the chance of a seat on a stage coach, or
the opportunity of a retnrn postchaUe.
The sovereign of those daya would have
thought it an Arabian Nignts' dream had
he been told that one of his proximate
successors would spend a good nart of the
year at a castle in the Scottish highlands.

THE AIR OP BEDROOMS.
They Are Exceedingly Liable to Be
Overcharged With Watery Vapor.
When there is too much water in the
atmosphere the person who breathes it is
to a certam limited extent deprived of Ins
due supply of oxygen, and &n elementary
beginning of suffocation is perceived in
his chest. Most middle-aged and all old
persons have lelt this, and all persona
also who have weak beans or imijauei
lungs. Now the air of bedrooms is ex
ceedingly liable to be overcharged will*
watery vupor.
The most obvious reasons for tlm are
tliai many bedrooms are never warmed
with tires, aud thai their windows are
often left open ail day until uusk, and

winch there was a temperature of fiÃ de

air in the drawing-ryom was dry, perhaps
a little too dry.
The air in the bedroom is saturated with
cold watery vapor. The person we are

ANCIENT WA.ER-HEATEBS
People Two Thomtnii Yesri Ago Had
Practical Convenience*.
In two of the museums of Roman
antiquities at Naples there are several
water-heater?, which indicate that the
principe of the water-tube, the crowning
feature of modern boilers, was 'ullv un
derstood and appreciated some 2000 years
ago. W. T. Bonner of Cincinnati, Ohio,
has bean investigating these heaters and
found them to be aa interesting as they
are beautiful. One of them consists of an
outer shell 12 inches in diameter and
nearly 17 inches hich, surmounted by a
somewhat bemisnherically shaped top.
Ineide this shell is an internal cylinder,
also having a hemispherical top, which is
10 inches in diameter and 12 inches high.
The two shells are connected at tbe bot
tom by a ritn, like the mud rinx of a loco
motive firebox, and the spuce between
them was fried with water. The grate
was formed of seven tubes mad* from
sheet bronze, rolled and soldered or brazed.
These tubes open at both ends into tbe
bottom of tbe space between the sheets,
thus forrnine a water-tube grate for the
fuel to rest upon. Charcoal was probably
ased with this heater, and was placed on
the grate through an opening 4 8 inches
hich and 4 inches wide, closed by h beauti
fully decorated door. The gases from the
fire escaped into tbe outer air through
three small openincs formed by tubes
crossing from the inner to the outer shell
about 5.6 inches above tbe grate. The
whole apparatus was raised about 12
inches on a tripod, go as to allow air to
reach the fu.'l.
In another boiler of somewhat the same
type tiie outtr snell has tbe form of an
nrn, wh 1Â« the inner shell rises from a
water-tubs crate to an opening In the
aide. It ia 12 inch's in diameter at the
widest part and 17.G inches high, and tup
ported on a tripod about fot:r inches higu.
Its renerai shape is mnch like that of ihÂ«
nilTer cream-pitchers kt:own as the Paul
RiTere patterns, although, of course, it s
much larger and has a top closed by a iid.
It has been sugpestmt that these utensils
mar bare serveJ at some time to beat
wine, as well as water, which suggestion
appeari reasonable, as many historians
-tate tbat t: c P<>n peiiano made great sse
of iiot dni:ks. It may be that they were
found ia one of the termpodi or cafes, of
which there were several in Pompeii. â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1597,
M INES & MINERS
The new trouble between the Anil-debris
Association of Sacramento' and the miners
over the recent unexpected assault on drift
and quartz mining in Nevada County has
rather remained in statu quo during the
week awaiting the report and action of a com
mittee of the Sacramento Chamber of Com
merce, which visited Nevada City , and tne
mines in question a week ago yesterday. If
sufficient influence can be brought to bear to
force the anti-debris people to drop their
new campaign there will b : peace rgain, but j
if not the miners are ready for war, and mat- I
ters will likely take a decisive turn this week. j
When Manager Phipps of the Anti-debris !
Association began suit in Sacramento County
H^a'nst the owners of the Goding and Good
win gravel mines in Nevada County about
three weeks ago no Injunctions were ask.d.
Then came the burst of indignation in Nevada
County over this new. threat to the reviving I
mining industry, end the threat of the Nevada j
City Board of Trade to boycott Sieraraento [
businessmen. This caused an investigating >
trip by a committee of the Sacramento j
Chamber of Commerce. Manager Phipps was j
advised not to go with, the commi tee, and i
when the committee reached Nevada City and
went out to the Godlng mine near You Bet an
injunction was unexpectedly served on the
owner of the mine in the presence of the com
mittee.' The mine has since been closed down.
The owner of the Goodwin mine was to have
met the committee, but learning of the in
junction kept out of the way. The committee.
had nothing 10 do with this operation. S. X
Thornton of San Francisco, vice-president of
the Miners' Association, had addressed the
Sacramento Chamber of Commerce on the
issue, and accompanied its committee, whicn
is not thought to be in sympathy with the
new move of the ami-debris people. The | re
port of this committee and the stand taken by
Sacramento Chamber ot Commerce, represent
ing the business interests or that city, will
probably be the most influential factor in de
termining the course of affairs.
â  Tne war of 4he valley people for a genera
tion'has always been confined to hydraulic
mining, which was almost wholly stopped at
a time when the production was $10,000,000
a year. The Caminetti law, the labors of the
Miners' Association, the dying out of the bit
ter feeling and the pending construction of
large restraining dams on the American,
Feather, Vuta and Bear rivers are bringing
about a resumption ot hydraulic mining un
der the control of Federal engineers, which !
means much to the prosperity of the mining j
regions and the State. Now the Anti-debris
As>oc'ution proposes to supervise and check
ground sluicing at drift mines and the deposi
tion of tailings from quartz mills.
The indignant miners universally declate
that the new move nas been made by the offi
cers of a dying organization simply to pre
serve their good j >b3 by finding a new way to
earn their good salaries. As Sacramento need*
the trade of the mountains, â  and as the anti
debris feeling is no longer very general or
fierce, it is possible that the new campaign
will be abandoned. If not it will ha:, 'rand
retard greatly the development of driit min
ing In the upper counties, a form of the in
dustry which has tremendous possibilities
ahead of it.
J. 11. Neff, president of the Miners' Associa
tion, takes a quiet view of the situation and
does hot anticipate that the association will
take up the fight. '
"I believe that a great number of the peo
ple of the valley want to see mining carried
on," he sail yesterday, "and that the. good
feeling will continue. The Miners-Associat
ion was not formed to p-otect individual in
terests but those of the whole industry. It
doesn't want to oppose decisions of the courts
or injure a neignbor. Of course, if this mat- I
ter is pushed It will likely solidify all the
mining Interest*, for if they can stop ground
sluicing they can: check nearly all drift ana
quartz mining. Bat 1 don't tnink it will
come to that." ... ;.
State Mineralogist A. S. Cooper has returned
from a trip to Santa Barbara, where he gave
j interested attention to the progress of the tun
net into the Santa Ynez Mountains, by which
Santa Barbara is tapping the elevated water
reservoirs of the mountains to provide itself a
water supply. This comparatively new way of
getting water without pumping, is one of Mr.
Cooper's hobbies, and in a few weeks he will
make a tour of the southern part of the State
to study geologic formations and the possibil
ities of developing this plan. The municipal
tunnel at Santa Barbara, four miles from the
city, is now in 1100 feet. The tunnel
is 1500 feet above the city, and
the How now is considerable. The
tunnel goes through sandstone strata tilted
at an angle of 30 degrees, separated at short
distance by clay seams caused by the grind
ing of the strata when they. were folded, and
which serve to impound the waters of the
porous strata.. There will be a reservoir near
the mouth oi the tunnel which will hold 500,
--000 gallons at an elevation of 1500 feet and
provide power for the electric lighting of the
city. A reservoir of 1,500,000 gallons at an
elevation of 300 feet will supply the water
pipe system. This reservoir is being, lined
with asphalium and Mr. Cooper believes that
this example of the u-e of asphaltum will do
much to increase Its use in lining reservoirs
and irrigating ditches in the future.
During the present year the studies of Depu
ties Watts and Fairbanks' and. of Mr. Cooper
in that region will be directed a good- deal to
the possibilities of these elevated subter
raneous supplies, and Mr. Cooper sees iv them
the one thing needed to make a long stretch
of ; that coast region â  the "â  greatest . ~ lemon
producing region in the world. ', . ;
No official information regarding the gold
producers' convention at Denver in July has
yet arrived, but as ft formal invitation is ex
pected iv a day or two President J. H. Ncfl ex-,
pects to have a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Miners'. Association here this
week to arrange for naming delegates. Presi
dent Neft, Secretary Sonntag and other leading
members of the association are much inter
ested in what is to be the most important as
semblage of mining men ever got together In
the West, and California will doubtless send %
large representation. - ':
The Denver committee in charge of the affair
bad taken up the idea .that. Color ado's, chief
contribution to the mining exhibit of the
meeting shall be in the mines, smelters, etc.,
of the miring districts convenient to Denver.,.
Tnere will' be a series of excursion* during and
after the convention to the most Interesting
things that Colorado can show in the mining
line. 'This alone would amount to a profitable
session of a summer mining school to any intel
ligent minor, for the conditions in Colorado
have resulted In many additions to the science
of gold mining and the efficiency of gold
saving ' processes. . â â  1' ; -- ' . ' - â¢
, :'. A number of San Francifco people of small,
means have organized the Santa Gertrudes;
Mining and Milling Company to find and work
one of those rich, old and lost Mexican mines
that was j once 'worked by a Dominican padre
and the Indians. Some Of the incorporators
are Postc fnce | employes. There ' re : 20,000
shares at $1 a share, to be paid In
monthly installments, and the stock sub
scribed "j yields $300 a : month for ? oper
ations. The recent success of â >, the Santa
Rosalia venture by Mint employes is an en.
courag-raen t to add another reopened and re
juvenated Mexican mine to the growing list.
The company is proceeding on the knowledge'

The week has brought two more important
deep-mining developments in the mot her lode.
In the Missachusctu Hill mine, Nevada
County, a floe body of ore has been struck in
the 300 level. It is three feet thick and indi
cates permanency- Tnls old mine, which ad
joins Grafs Valley, is now in the hand of East
ern people, who have b -e i working and pro>
pecting for a year with little succe-s. T;.e
managers had confidence that they had a gooJ
mine, but C'Uid not discover the pay chute.
Their confidence and persistence have been
rewarded, as such confidence Is being re
warded right along on the mother iode.
A fe-.v days ago ihe strike of a rich vein at the
1300 level of the rehabl itaied old Gwin mine
in Calaveras County whs noted. During the
wees a second find of a larse body of good ore
on the 1403 Â»evei has been made. It is reported
that the ore will run into the hundreds per
ton. Tiiese discoveries of the deep value of
mother lode mines coming wiih increasing
frequency are hastening a great era of deep
mining in California. At the Utica, One. da
and other mines slinfts are now being driven
to greater deptns because of this confidence
and more discoveries will aoubt.ess soon bj
announced. Tha idea that the values of the
mother lode are not deep and permanent is be
ins dispelled, and capital. especially California
capital, is teady to hunt lor god by going
deep rather than by huuting for surface indi
cations.
At the Rawhide experiments are being made
to determine wneiher a concentrating or
cyanide plant of 100 tons capacity shall be
put in.â During the tirg: three months of this
year the United States produced 1229 tons
more copper than in the corresponding period
of last year. The exports showed a still greater
increase owing to t!:e grow iuÂ«t European de
mand, and the outlook (or the copper industry
is bright.â Charles D. Lsns has bought an
interest in the Eureka mine at Corbat, Ariz.â
A siphon line 20' JO feet long is being put
across Stewaris Fork in Trinity County by the
La uranete Hydraulic Mining Company.â
Captain Thomss Mem has gone to Alaska to
look after his interests In Silver Bow Basin.
State Mineralogist Cooper is considering the
idea of taking up io tne extent practicable, as
a part of the work of the Mining Bureau, the
study of the oppor;unltiea for the develop
ment oi electrical power in tha mining re
gions. This seems especially important to the
Randsburg district just now, as the question
of power will bj on; of increasing importance
as development proceeds. Should the veins of
that aisirict prove va.uable with depth, oper
ations will be carried oil with difficulty and
expense even when a branch railroad cheapens
a coal supply. The Kern River which, at dif
ferent points, flows irom foriy to seventy-five
miles distant from Kandfburg, seems to many
to be bound up with the future of that desert
district. Tne present electrical power plant
on the Kern River is on its lower course and
uses but about a mile of the stream. Higher
up toward the headwaters are many oppor
tunities ior u?ing ihe power of the stream,
and, with the recent successes in iong-distance
transmiasion, ther- 1 seems to be within reach
of Kancsburg ail the power its mines will
need awaiting only the development of a de
mand that will warrant a great power enter
prise.
Throughout the mining regions of the Sierra
Nevada* and the northern counties the de
parture of winter snows and the Determent of
the roads have put into ectivity all the develop
ment operation;! whtch have been planned
within the past lew months, ana the local
papers every where record the rapid erection
o:' mills and other machinery, the sinking of
sbaits, the running of tunnels and the sale
ana bonding of mines. 1h) army of pros
pectors is our, and it is bigger than at any
season for twenty-five years. The reopening of
the old mines is being extensively carried on.
One of the latest is the old Calaveras mine,
near Sheep Ranch, in Calaveras County, which
has been bonded by San Francisco men. T.ns
mine has been idle for ten years, though
$4)0.000 was taken out with a (>OO-foot de
velopment. The company prop-fa -s to put in
a large piant and sink at once to 1000 feet.
Street >ameÂ« in London. j
There is much that is curious and inter
esting about the ori in an i meaning of
.London name!. Some â¢>[ them are
taken from the names of previous owners
or occupants of property in the neighbor
hood, while others are rteriveii . from: the
signs of old inns, such as the Bell, Crown,
Beehive, Mitre, Pncenix, Plough,. Star,
Swan, etc., and others, again, are due to
former monastries and churches. . .â :_ Â£ S |.S
In Mincing lane, for instance, was once
a convent of the Minchuns, the old- Eng
lish feminine for monk;, the Minones was
the aite of tne old convent of St. Clare, the
nun s of 1 which , were ... called "Sororet
Minores" , and came to be known as
â¢'Minoresses.' 1 .Â, .-... : . 1
Miles lane is a corruption of St.
Michael's lane; Mark lane for Mart (mar
ket) lane; Sermon lane for Shermonier
lane, the locality of the "shereruone'yers,"
â who sheared or clipped bullion into shape
for coinage at the exchange near by ; Be
lane for Bt. Oiytn's lane: Gutter lane for
Guthrun lane," lrom a Dane who owned
property there. "â¢,'Â»*;â â¢â¢
: The Knighten guild, a company of thir
teen knights to whom King Edgar granted
land in th* neiphborboou, is responsible
for Nightingale lane, and Crutched Friars
is in memory of the crouched or crossed
friars, so called from the re i cross on t-eir
robes, who had a monastery liter.-.
That Jane S v ore died in a ditch at
Shoreditch Is only a pathetic legend In
vented to account for he name of that lo
calityâreally derived from John de Sor
dich, Lord in 1343 of what was then a
suburban Tillage. Names 1 such as Rose
mary, Honeysuckle," etc., were, of course,
given before the outlying districts, were
swallowed up in the growth of the city.

PfiETTY LONESOME WORK
That of thÂ« Llght]iouse>KeÂ«peri Along
the Florida Keys.
More ships' bones lie on the outer reel
girdling the keys of South Florida than
perhaps upon any other shoals, excepting
Hatteras, in this country. Captain
Thomas S. E.-lls, agent of the Lloyds in
this city, has' a .record , of shipwrecks on
the coast of Florida for many years, an
the aggregate of Josses fonts up surpris
ingly i.igh in the millions of dollars.
The Strait of Florida has long ber-n an
ocean highway for steamers and sailing
ships bound from foreign and domestic
ports to New Orleans, Central and South
America. In fact, tne outlet of the great
Gulf of Mexico, surrounded by rich and
ertile countries, has bean this narrow
strait between the keys and Cuba, through
which the Gulf Stream passes.
Consequently it is not surprising that U
thi* narrow strait, the caldron where the
West Indian hurricanes generate, with
its concealed reefs of cruel coral, thou
sands of vessels have ended their careers,
and more than thonsands of men
have lost their lives. Few sailors pass
through the strait without being re
minded of the brave men and the brave
snips whose skeletons whiten the sands
beneath the surface of the limpid green
waters, and some of them, as they watch
the storm scud fly across the moon and
listen to the moan of the reef buoy ruin
gling with the creaking of the spars of the
spars of the ship, perhaps have good
ground to believe that this place is
haunted by demons of the deep and the
souls of deaa comrades.
It is no wonder that the inhabitants of
the keys, the "Conchs,' 1 have grown rich
in wrecking. In these latter days, how
ever, there are fewer wrecks in the strait
than there were some years ago, for Uncle
Sam has marKed the contour of the dart
eerous h d<ien reef with a Sne system of
lighthouses, each with a light of Reparatc
and distinct character, so that the mari
ner may know how to shape his course in
the blackest and stormiest o' nights.

the loneliest way of making a living in the
catalogue of occupations. The mental
strain has proven so great in several in
stances that the keeper grew melancholy
to such a degree that he ended it by blow
ing out his brains. The system is now so
arranged that the sudden darkening of an
important reef lamp by a suicide's bullet
is not probable, for two keepers are sta
tioned in each light for company's sake
as well as to guard against sickness.
These two keepers of tbe key lights for
two months on a stretch seldom see any
faces except their own and converse with
nobody except each other. The licht
houses are, on an average, twenty miles
from land, and ships pass from ten
to twenty miles away. The light
houses are built of four great iron pii
lars, founded deep in the coral and tower
ing toward each other. Platforms oi steel
bind the pillars together, sleeping and
storage rooms are constructed and the
lamp crowns all. The place is not peril
ous, but in a storm must be what the
colored folks call "lonesome" to an un-
canny degree.
After two months of service the keeper
has a month ashore to spend with hi*
family or how he pleases. The families
of the reef Jightkeepers are not allowed in
the houses. They are looked upon as a
d straction that might cause the keeper to
neglect h;s duty.
Most of the keepers bare developed into
omnivorous readers. Some of them, how
ever, have pursued a steady purpose, and
one we have in mind prepared himself for
admittance to the b.tr, and him since be
come one of Key West's most eminent
lawyers. He has a dramatic manner of
expression, and learned it, so 'tis saia, by
"noratin" to the winds and to the wave?,

DANGEROUS TO OPPOSE HIM.
How a Georgia Statesman Overcame
Utifriendlj Voter*.
Phil Cook was one of the old- school
politicians very much on tha Davy
Crockett and Abraham Lincoln order,
â¢>ays the Atlanta Constitution. He knew
how to appeal to tbe populace with a
sood story or an apt application, and his
repertoire of anecdotes was replenished
from time to time so that be had always
something wise or witty to give to the
wool-hat brigade when occasion de
manded.
On one occasion he was running for
Congress for tbe second term in succes
sion, and in stumping his district he
struck Coffee County. He had got his
bearings in advance and was loaded for
bear as well as for recreant suffrage sling
ers.
When he mounted the rostrum he cast
liis eagie eye over the assemblage and dis
covered that there were a number of col
ored men present. He began his speech
in his usual off-hand style, and directed
many pertinent appeals to the negroes.
He bad been informed of the fact in ad
vance thai two of them who had voted
against him in the previous race had
either met with a violent death or got
into trouble.
'I have learned," said he, "that there
were two colored men who voled against
me in the la^t electionâ Jim Jones and
Bob Thompson. Now, I had never done
anything to ether of these men to cause
them to sro buck on me that way. Does
any one present know anything of the
whereabouts of Jim Jon*B, who voted
against me on that occasion? Speak out,
it there is any one who know*."
"Yassir," replied an old negro in the
crowd, "I knows, gineral. He's dead."
"Do you know what killed him?"
â¢'Lightnin' struck 'irn an' kilt'im dead,"
repned the old darky.
"Well, that looks bad. Now, does any
body know what became of Bill Thomp
son, who voted agninst me? There were
only two man in Coffee County, mind you,
who bad the bad grace to oppose me in
that race. Jim Jones is dead â now, what
about Thompson?
"Why, gineral," spoke up another
larky, "he's in the chaingang. Dey sont
'mi dar fo' stenlin' er hawg."
â¢'Ah, ha! So one of my opponents \3
dead and the other is in the cbaingang.
That is a mighty bad showing, boys, and
don't you see how dangerous it is to vote
against me?"
Tip Harrison is the authority for the
statement that Coffee County went Bolid
for Phil Cook after that every time he
offered and that all creation couldn't, have
mrned those negroes after his iorcibie il
lustrtition of the danger attendant upon
disloyalty to him and his cause.

A shopman was showing a lady some
nara&ols. He had a good command of the
language, and knew how to expatiate un
the good qualities and show the bes>.
points of the goods. As he picked up a
parasol from the lot on the counter and
opened it he struck an attitude of admiru
tion and, holding it up, said:
"Now, there, isn't it lovely? Look at
that silk. Particularly observe the qual
ity, the finish, the general effect. Pass

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting- away witn nervous
I weakness the mental forebodings are ten
! times worse than the mo->t severe pain. There
i is no let up to the mental suffering; day or

' such a strain men arc scarcely, responsible for
I whit they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sen of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of -poison- and thus end all
bis throubles. But providential .inspiration
came to his aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but 'enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
be now declares that any man who* will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment

without cost, because I wsmt every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. "

an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men

CHICAGO MAIIKKTS.
CHICAGO, 1liÂ». May 15.â Heavy selling by
i prominent local traders caused a sharp break In
I early trading, part of which was recovered before
the close. The Increased movement of live hogs
this week and the prospects of liberal receipts next
week, together with the poor cash demand, were
the depressing factors. Another bearish factor,
however, is the dullness of speculation, â â shor.s'"
being the only buyers.

Continued reports from the principal Prune dis

THE NEW POSTOFFICE

Manufacturers' Association Will M. ke
a Fight Against Eat m
Material.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has determined that the new
Federal building, to be known as the Post
office buildine. shall be made of California
materials so far as possible. In a recent dis
patch :o The Cai l from Washington,
D. C. the statement was made that the
owners of Massachusetts and Vermont
quarries are doing all in their power at the
capital to secure the stone contracts for
the San Francisco, as well as the Chicago,
Postoltice buildings. The first move to
block this was made yesterday by Oscar
Lewis, the association's manager, sending
the following dispatch :
Hon. Eugene F. â  Loud, , Member of Congress,
Washington, D.C.: Referring 10 : Washington
dispmciivs concerning tne new Fostoflice
ma.eriais, tlie uÂ»e of stone otner than from
local sources would be considered a great in
justice to this coast. Wi.l write fully. â¢â 
manufacturers' and producers* association
of california. > ..
. Mr. Lewis in order to be provided with
data upon. the stone question has inter
viewed several of the principal builders of
this City.' Among these are the Mahoney
Brothers, J. G. Day, the contractor who
constructed the Cascade locks, R. McCann
of the Rae Building and Contracting Com
pany, I. H. Knowies of the Raymond
Granite Com cany, Daniel McPhee of ; the
McPhee Sandstone Company, and others.
Although all of these gentlemen represent
d fferent building interests,: they are all
united upon one point, and that is that
the material for the . San Francisco Post
office should be obtained on the Pacific
Coast. They claim that the granite and
sandstone of this State are equal for build
ing purposes to : any - produced from the ,
Eas'ern quarries, to say nothing of the
expense.
Mr. Lewis states that a new sandstone
quarry is being uncovered in Alameda
county, which it is believed will be the
best for color and durability of any in this
secuon of the State. He says that the
authorities at Washington are perfectly
familiar with the building stones of Cali
fornia. A year or so ago an agent of tbe
Government came to this State, ana be
sides making a thorough examination of
tbe quarries took back with him a large
case of stone o! all kinds for tests at the
Goverument station at Annapolis. Some
samples stood a pressure of 20,000 ponnds
to the square inch. In the letters upon
this subject to be forwarded to the Pacific
Coast delegates at Washington all of these
features and points will be dwelt upon in
detail, for it is determined to have Cali
fornia materiuls used in ttie construction
of tue new San Francisco PostofHce build

One reason why women are so gener-
ally troubled with some derangement of
the distinctly feminine organism is that as
girls they learn nothing about their own
physical make up. Parents are waking up
to the importance of education of this kina,
and young women are becoming more and
more able to take care of their health.
Carelessness in girlhood causes the great-
est suffering and unhappiness in after life.
Little irregularities and weaknesses in girls
should be looked after promptly and treat-
ment given at once. Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription promotes regularity of all fem-
inine functions, makes strength and builds
up a sturdy health with which to meet the
trials to come. The " Favorite Prescrip-
tion " is not a universal panacea. It is
good for but one thing. It is directed
solely at one set of organs.
" I have been a sufferer from ' female weak-
Bess' for six years. I grew worse; had severe
cutting pains in left ovary, also in left side and
stomach. The pain in left side was constant. I
would have light spasms previous to monthly
period and when the spasm would leave I would
suffer from severe soreness all over and could
bear nothing to touch me. I also suffered from
â¢evere headaches; burning pressure on brain
which almost caused me to be insane. I could
not lay my head down without smothering. My
face was poor; eyes looked dead; wasted in flesh.
I was constipated and suffered severe pain when
bowels would act. I could not eat for the full-
ness in region of stomach. I had tried three of
the best doctors here but they only gave me tem-
porary relief. I had given up all nope of ever
getting well again. At last I concluded to give
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription a trial. I have
taken two bottles, one of the Golden Medical
Discovery ' and one of ' Pellets. 1 I have not felt
any signs of ray old disease; headache all gone;
menses regular without ache or pain. Indeed I
feel like a new person." Yours truly.

A NEW ATTACK ON
J .Z. DAVIS' WILL
Forgery Is Now Charged
by Mrs. Elizabeth
V. Wilson.
Lizze Muir and Belle Curtis
Cal ed On to Defend Their
Legacies.
Contestants Say the Estate Is Worth
$2,000,000, While th? Other Side
Call It $750,000.
The estate of the late Jacob Zigler Davis
has furnished another sensation in legal
circles. Home lime ago a contest to the
probate ot the Davis will was filed by
nephews of the decedent. Yesterday an
other notice of contest w*s given, this
time by Mrs. Elizabeth V. Wilson of
Washington, D. C, widow of a nephew
of Davis.
Mrs. Wilson appears on behalf of her
children, who would be entitled to a share
of the estate if the will should be declared
invalid.
The will is very brief and purports to
have been written entirely by the testator;
in other words, it is presented as an olo
graphic instrument ana reads as follows:
October 1, 1896.
I, Jacob Z. Davis, will and bequeath every
thing I have in tnis world to my beloved
uieces, Lizzie Muir. mid Belle Curtis.
Jacob Z. Davis.
When the original contest was filed it
was stated that it was a singular fact that
the two women referred to as nieces were
not biood relatives of the millionaire.
The contestants did not know exactly
what the relationship was thai existed
between them, but it is now explained
that they are the nieces of his dead wife.
It appears that Boyd and Davis married
Bisters.
Tbe document filed yesterday among
other allegations contains the following:
The wife of said Jacob Z. Davis and the wife
of Alexander .boyd and the mother of said
Lizzie Muir and Belle Curtis, their brother
and mother all lived together in intimate
social relations for yearn prior to and up to
the time of his death, and that each and all of
said peisons exercised and possessed great in
fluence upon and over Â«Â«id deceased, and that
they had all agreed and persuaded and 1:.
--duced said deceased to feel and believe that
hÂ« was not very wealthy, that there was only
enough property possessed by the said
Boyd and I'avis to support and main
tain the famines oi said Boyd and
â aid Davis and said Lizzie Muir and
Belle Curtis, their brother and mother in the
event of the death o! Â»aid Boyd or Davis, and
that if any of the blood relatives of the said
Davis were to be given or have any share or
part in the estate or property of said Dnvis
that they (the blood relatives) would compel a
dissolution and winding up of the said co
partnership and a distribution of its property
to and among them, ami by litigation dnroage,
impair and destroy said property and possibly
bankrupt said Boyd and leave said Lizzie Muir
and Belle Curtis unprovided for; that there
fore said Davis and said Boyd should mate
mutual wills or other kind of wills as would
obviate all possibility of such results.
Continuing, the contestant alleges that
Bord and Davis and their wives did make
mutual wills in favor of each other. The
oontcstant further asserts tha.t Airs. Boyd
and her nieces caused Davis to hate his
blood relatives, and when be visited the
home of his niece in Philadelphia he was
accompanied by Lizzie Muir and Belle
Curtis, who were with him constantly to
prevent him from visiting her.
There ii a grim suggestion of a domestic
tragedy in the following allegation made
by Mrs. Wilson:
While said Davis was lying in bed during
his last illness in tne Continental Hotel in
Philadelphia he succeeded in getting the said
Lizzie Muir and Belle Curtis out of his room
and fiom his presence, and he solicited and
secured the personal and exclusive attend
ance in his room of one John Senderling, a
relative of the blood of said Jacob Z. Davis,
but one step further removed, and said Davis
then and there being unable to write, and ap
prehending deatn, requested said John Sen
derling to write at his dictation the will of
sad Jacob Z. Davis, and what he desired and
wished to be done with his estate, and who
snould be the objtcts of his bounty ; that said
Davis bad during his lifetime in this
City been intimately couiected with
and wrapped up in curtain socie
ties such us the Siate Mining Bureau and
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, of wh eh he was president, end bad
repeatedly expressed his du-iro and intention
to make geiterous provision for such societies
in such will as he should make, and that ho
had reached his dictation to said Senderling
of his desires respecting said societies, and
had not given to said Lizzie Muir or Belle
Curtis anything, when his .ife commenced
ebbing, nnd he died while dictating to said
Senderling, and the document, to the extent
it was written, was kept by said Heuderling,
and it is now in his possession in Philadelphia ;
and that said Lizzie Muir and Belle Curtis
left the body of said Davis unburied in an
undertaker's establishment in Philadelphia
and left lor San Francisco, and subsequently
iroin here ordered it cremated.
Mr*. Wilson direct!y charges that t c
will of Davis is a forgery, and on that
issue the main battle will be fought. She
ways the estate is worth not less than
$2,000,0C0, thoueh efforts have been made
to have it appear much less.
L zzie Muir and Belle Curtis, the lega
tees under the will, were prompt in re
sponding to this new attack on their in
terests as legatees under the will, for they
file-i an answer to Mrs. Wilson's contest
within six hours after that document was
handed to the clerk of the court. In this
answer, Â»h cli was pr sented by Attor
neys E. B. and George H. MasticK, they
deny in detail ail of Mrs. Wilson's accusa
tions, and assert that as a matter of fact
the estate of the testator is worth not
more than $750,000.
Experts In handwriting have been ex
amining the will for several days for the
purpose of ascertaining whether it is gen
uine or a forgery.
The trial of the case was set for next
Monday in Judge Coffey's court, but it is
expected that tne new contest by Mrs.
Wilson wiil lead to a postponement of the
hearing.
SOUTH OF THE CHANNEL.
Steady Improvement Marks an Era of
rrogrrm in the Potrero District.
Conlinuous activiiy on a proeressive
scale of improvements is noticeable in tbe
southern part of the City, south of the
channel line. In the course of a few
weeks the crown of Scotch Hill will be
capped by a mammo'.h steel tank, in
which Spring Valley water will be stored
for the use of the entire section, including
the various manufacturing institutions
located at tbe base of the blue rock bill.
Daylight now appehrs through a western
cut made by the Potrero Land and Im
provement Company on a lin9 with
Twentieth street.
The rock taken from this hill has been
dumped into a ravine north of the rope
works, making suitable building sites,
which will in the near future become peo
pled with the families of tbe mechanics
working close by.
Grading and paving have been effected
oa Twentieth btreet, from Kentucky to
the rolling-mill's gate, over which the
Southern Pacific Company has laid a
track by which trains can now discharge
and receive material from both the Union
Iron Works and the rolling-mills at their
yards.
This with a line to the Spreckels sugar
works offers facilities for toe transporta
tion of the products from that establish
ment without the inconvenience of trues
hauling.
Since the completion of Railroad avenua
from South San Francisco to the Six-mile
House a new line of travel has been
opened up over which the outlying trades
people now travel instead of going round
by the San Bruno road and the Mission.
This new way is hailed with much delight
by the vegetable men and dairy producers
from San Mateo County who dispose of
their products in the San Francisco
markets.
Even the police stations at the Potrero
and in South San Francisco have been
seized by the progressive spirit going on
about there. To sucn an extent has this
leaven worked that both stations have
been remodeled and refitted by that
master mechanic. Officer Linby, who has
done creditable work for the City.
