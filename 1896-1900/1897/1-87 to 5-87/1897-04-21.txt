LONDON, Eng., April 20.â Ed hem
Pasha, the Turkish commander-in-chief,
continues to pJay Napoleon's "openings"
in the chess game of war, and so far he
has strong prospects of success. Every
resource is being brought to bear 10 break
through the Greek center, the Turks not
being content to merely hold the enemy j
on the wings. The success of this policy ;
â will be the most decisive of the whole !
campaign, for it will cut the Greek forces ,
in two ami open the road for a victorious I
inarch to Athens.
The Greek successes at Preveza and In |
Southern E:-irus will be of no value un
less the Turks are driven back at a vital
point on the Thessalian frontier.
To-day's news from Milouna, Larissa
and Turnavo is conflicting, but a careful i
analysis forces the general conclusion f
that the Turks still have decidedly the \
best of it at must of the critical spots, j
This is due apparently to Turkish su- ,
periority, both in numbers and in leader
ship. It is also pirtly due to the careful
tuition given the Turkish officers by â  the
Government military experts as well
as Ed hem Pasha's wonderful military
genius.
Daring the past three days he has dem
onstrated all the qualities of a great
genera!, and those correspondents who â 
have watched his masterful control of '
every feature of the situation declare their !
belief that be will speedily march his ,
army to Athens.
There is no great commander on the
Greek side. Two or three sad mistakes
have already been made by the Greek offi- !
cers. It is astonishing that these errors '
have not dampened the ardor of the Greek j
troops, but their conduct has been mag
nificent on every occasion. O.'d war cor
respondents leerapu that they never â¢
saw such lighting. Men on neither side j
seem to know what fear is. Turkish fatal
ism and Greek fury led the opposing ranks j
several times on Sunday ana Monday to
stand face to face with each other until both
were mowed down by the merciless mutual
â¢laugnter. One hillside in Milouna Pass ;
was literally covered with dead ana dying i
Greeks before possession was yielded to j

the Turks. The bloody work of Sunday
and Monday in Thessaly was so ter.-ible
that one or two correspondents estimate
the killed and wounded on both sines at
20,000. This is entirely beyond beiief,
considering the number of men engagsd,
but it indicates the character of the Bght
ing. It tends also to justify the opinion
expressed in last night's dispatches to the
Sun and Call, that the war would be ter
rific, but brief. Ttis opinion is now held
by almost every one in Europe. Many
believe that the hostilities will not extend
beyond ten days.
The Turkish advantage, if maintained
sharply and foilowed up, ought to make
it necessary for the powers to interpose
before the end of next week, unless they
are willing that the Greeks should be
completely trampled in she dust.
It would be altogether promature, how
ever, to assume that the Greek cause is
â  hoj>eless on account of the loss of im
portant positions in T..es->aly. The Turks,
apparently, have it in their power now to
engage the Greek army, which ia inferior
in number?, in a decisive battle on the
plains of Northern Thessaly. Defeat, of
course, would be disastrous, but the Greeks
are expecting every hour to hear great
news irom the fleet which sailed Sunday
from the Piraeus under sealed orders.
ThÂ« capture of Salon ica, the main Turk
ish base, by the fleet wonld raise the
Greek hopes, though it would not compen
sate for the disaster in Thessaly.
Some dispatches that have been received
, here indicate that there is some expecta
! tion that the fleet will make a deaporate
attempt to force its way through the
Dardanelles and attack Constantinople.
! It is argued, even by some English ex
perts, that the forcing of the Dardanelles
! would be largely a matter of luck. A
| small fleet might possibly slip through
| when a large one would be driven back or
| destroyed. It certainly neeJs some such
bold stroke in the opinion of military ob
servers, to equalize the pending struggle.
It is more than ever apparent to-day that
PJurope regards the situation as not be
yond the control of the powers, and as
. free from serious danger of a general con
flagration. Shonld tne tide turn and the
i Greeks become victorious there's no doubt
I that financial and political Europe will Le

THE FIGHT IN MELOUNA PASS, as Seen From the Hills Back of Turnavo.
From Turnavo north tbe ground slopes gently upward until it reaches the foothills of the Melouna* Mountains, on which sland the villages of Ligaria and
Kourtsiovali, after which the ascent is very abrupt until it reaches the Minimi s which overlook Melouna end Reveni Passes. Ligaria lies on the main road from Larissa

GENERAL ADVANCE.
Movemont of the Turks That May
Only Be Checked by Defeat
or the Powers.
ELASSONA, Tirkey, April 2Lâ At an
early hour this morning the Turkish camp
was alive and active preparations were
making for a general advance.
The forward movement began before
a.iyo.-eak, the men movine as freely as
though they had not just taken part in a
hotly contested battle. During the nisfht
the Greeks had established themselves on
the last height near the town of Turnavo.
The order was given early for the Turks
to attack this position, and the artillery
moved up and took a good position to
assail the G r eeks. For a short time brisk
firing was exchanged, but the Greek artil
lery speedily put out of action.
TURKS NOW MIRTHFUL.
Success Causes Their Fierce An-
KÂ«r to Civ? Way to Their
Wild Joy.
ELASSONA, Tirkey. April 20.âAd
vices from Milouna Pass show that the
battalion ieft to guard the retreat of the
Greek army after their defeat yesterday
made but ieeble resistance to the attack
directed against them by tue Ottoman
forces. Tne Turks has scarcely any diffi
culty in mounting an eminence upon which
a battalion was stationed, and as they
approached the Greek position many of
the latter signified their desire to surren
der.
The Turks were in a most jovial mood,
the rierce anger they had displayed
while the Greeks offered resistance having
disappeared, and many of the men were
laughing or singing as they occupied ail
the abandoned heights. The main boJy
of the Turks is encamped to-night on the
plains south of tbe pass, and the men are
sleeping in tents that the Greeks aban
doned In their hasty retreat toward La
rissa.
The Moslems have superb confidence in
themselves and their leaders, and are
anxious for the order to advance upon the
headquarters of the Greeks at Lanssa.

LONDON, Eso.. April 20.â A dispatch
sent from the head of Milouua Pass at 1
o'clock Monday morning confirms the
ieports already cabled that the Turks in
fightl.ag there carried everything before
them and that the Greets were in full
retreat toward the plains of Thessaly. A
single bat taliou was posted on an emi
nence to cover tbe retreat oi the Greek
army, and at the time of sending the dis
patch desultory fighting wa3 going on
between this guard and tbe Turks.
Meanwhile a Turkish battery was playing
with deadly effect upon the retreating
Greeks, shrlis bursting in the midst of
closely packed battalions, killing Greeks
in groups. In the rear the Greek artillery
tried to rep'.y to the fire of the enemy, but
was altogether overmatched. The success
of the Turks was directly due to the supe
riority of their artillery.

HAF.Z PASHA'S DEATH.
The Otd Turkish Veteran Showed !
Himself to Be a Came Soldier
to the Last.
ELABBONA, Tcrkey, April 30.â The
death of Hafiz Pasha, tne Turkish com
mander who was killed Saturday during
the fighting in Melouna Pass, it thus de
scribed by a correspondent: Hahz Pasha,
who took part in Uie Crimean war aitd tbe
Kusso-Turkish war of 1877, was Â£0 years of
ace, but was yet full of right. He was ad
â¼ancingat the head of his command, when
one of his orderlies besged h.m to dis
mount in order that he would not present I
such a fair mark for the enemy. Hafiz, in
reply, said thai he had never dismounted
during engagements in which he took part
in the Russo-Turkish war and he could see
no good reason why he should do so in
this war. Shortly afterward a rifle bui let
struck him in tne left arm, but the old
soldier still refused to withdraw. A little
later another bullet struck him in the right
hand. Strenuous efforts were made to in
duce him to turn over the command to
another officer in order that the wounds
might be treated, but he declined to with
draw, maintaining his right to lead h:s
troops into action. While moving forward
encouraging his men a ballet entered his
mouth, severed his spine and killed him
instantly.

Dance.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 20.â The
gay festival Queen has the ribbons in her
dainty hands and her gayly caparisoned
steeds are prancing in the mi Idle oi the
road. Talk of the caballeros! they are
but an incident.
With all her retinue and under an
especially arranged play of electric lights,
so that theie could be no mistake as to
ber identity, perhaps, the Queen came
upon the stage to-night and Mayor Snyder
retired from it. The proclamation of
sovereignty was made, to remain in fores
and effect for the balance of the week,
ana the word was given to let the revel
beinn.
The city is in complete order for ths
loosing of all restraint. Its gala dress is
on, with all the trimmings. The wine,
orange and olive fly to the breeze every
where and in prodigal quantity, with.
palms and evergreens sufficient to give
the city t lie appearance of a great park.
To-night the electric lamps are lighted
and the streets are made brilliant by the
subdued lights of the incandescent tri
colored lamps strung in myriads over
head, extending In converging lines ia
every direction and here and there span
ning tne thoroughfare at crossings in high
inverted V-shaped aiches. The effect it
very fane.
While the city seems crowded already
with out-of-town people, there is no doubt
that it is merely the sign of the presence
of the advance-guard, and that to-morrow,
when the festival puts forth its first great
public demonstration, the army of sight
seers will arrive in its full strength.
The initial number of the five days' pro
gramme, which was rendered to-night at
the pavilion, struck a high, fine keynote
for the whole. It was the fancy-dress
masquerade ball, with the ceremony of
installing the Queen of the festival. It
was a distinctively artistic and esthetically
beautiful affair throughout, with no sug
gestion of the amateurish hippodroming
that has characterized this part of the
festival on previous occasions.
The pavilion was done up in the color
of the poppy from end to end, and with
its green trimmings and festoons of
Chinese lanterns, the ballroom proper, in
the center of the big hall, fenced in with,
a trellis of sweet peas, was very beautiful.
The space under the galleries, as well as
the galleries themselves, was reserved to
spectators, and (a thing quite unusual in
itself), both were filled to their utmost
capacity, even the high upper gallery.
In the center of the wide stage, filled
with courtiers and ladies in silks ana
shining satins, sat the Queen on her
tnrone, the lights so arranged that her
Majejty was properly conspicuous.
At 8:15 o'clock the band played its open
ing overture, tlie guests, strange as it is to
record it, being nearly all in their places.
Two trumpeters announced the approach,
of the Queen, and were answered by two
other trumpeters stationed at the foot of
the throne.
With the band playing a march, the
royal party made its entrance, led by
trumpeters and followed by the colors,
officers of the guard, Queen's colors, gen
tlemen in waiting, one bearing the sword
with which the knights were to be
knighted, and another carrying a pillow
upon which to rest the orders of decora
tions of the knights. Immediately after
came the Queen and her pages, and ladies
and gentlemen of the court.
The guard, with their golden lances up
lifted, formed on each side from the en

"After an illness* of two years, daring
which time I underwent several surgical
operations, I at last began to improve, but
my improvement was so slow that I be-
came discouraged and it seemed as though
I would never get strong again. , I was
very much run down, I had no appetite
and I did not care to live. One day I met
a friend who had taken Hood's Sarsa-
parilla, and I was advised to try it. After
I bad taken a few doses I began to feel
better and had a better appetite. I gained
from two to three pounds -a week and
grew stronger every day. I took two or
three bottles of Hood's Sarsaparilla and
am now as strong as I ever. was, and I
praise Hood's Sarsaparilla for bringing
me back to health." ; Emily Billixgeb,

trance to the throne the length of the
hall, and the royal party passed down the
line between them. The trumpeters went
on up and took their position with the
other trumpeters at the side of the throne,
tne colors also taking a position back of
the throne. As the Queen took her seat
the courtiers took positions on the right
and left, saluting. There was another
flourish of trumpets and then Mayor
â¢Snyder stepped forward and made a low
obeisance.
"Your Most Gracious Majesty," he said,
"in the name of the quiet, law-abidine
and sedate citizens of the city of Los An
eeles, the duty devolves upon me and it be
comes my distinguished pleasure to re
nounce my jurisdiction during your stay,
to bid your court a cordial welcome, and
to express the hope that your reign may
be merry and happy, for you and til your
pleasure-loving people. I present to your
Majesty the key to the gates of the city."
The key was handed to the Prime Min
ister, who in turn laid it upon a pillow at
her Majesty's feet. Again the trumpet
blast, and when the Queen, through licr
J'riine Minister, made reply:
I am requested by her Majesty, our gracious
Queen, to express to one and all of you her
biucere appreciation of the kind reception you,
I as loyal subject* and citizens of this, her true
province and most remembered city, have
given.
To you, Mr. Orator, selected from the fore
most ranks of her e.oquent citizens, she ex
tunds her gracious thanks for the warm and
kind words extending to her a welcome in be
half of this, her City.
To you, Mr. Mayor, in whose hands has been
,placed the sacred trust 01 the Executive ol
this fair municipality, she expresses her ap
preciation of the kindness which inspires you
to present to her this exquisitely wrought
key, emblematic of the desire on your part
and on the part of the City that its gates be
thrown, widely extended, for her entrance and
enjoyment.
â¢ fane desires me to say. Mr. Mayor, as her ser
vant and as a servant of her people, living
within her most favored province, living in a
realm abounding wit., nil the resources and
gifts that God can bestow upon a laud and I
give to a favored peopleâ she desires, I say, I
that you, as such servant, go forth, yea. to
night, and say to these, her people, her royal .
SDDJ.cts, she proclaims that during her stay |
within the gates of her city she wishes, she
1 desires, nay, she commands all to cast aside
all care, all heavy thought and all 'ear, and
again, as they have in the past upon her an
nual visit, let only joy, briithtne^s and hap
piness only reign within their hearts.
. Next from the throne was read this
'proclamation:
Hear ye, most favored and loyal subjects of
her Majesty the Queen of Li Fiesta.
PROCLAMATION.
' A year agoâ on April 24, in the year "1896
and vi our reign the thirdâ we, your Queen,
ljpjn our annual visit, established am! or- j
dained the order of Knight* of La Fiesta, i
1 Then and there we had caused an inquiry to I
be maae by our servants into all thu causes
which had produced the condition of affairs
' which at that time gave evidence to us that
our mo>>t favored province showed a wonder- j
ful advance in the welfare, fortunes and con- j
cerns of our beloved people. As a result of :
; such inquiry we hud been informed that this
I prosperity, this lortune, was due- to the efforts
' of certain worthy citizens of our realm.
This had pleased us. We believed our citi- j
zens deserved recognition for the efforts in i
bringing about this result which so gratified ;
their Queen.
We desire to state that upon our return we
find still greater evidence of advancement and
prosperity and of general welfare. Again we I
nave caused our servants to make this in- I
quiry, and again we rind that it is due to the i
united and constant effort of our people.
Standing out prominent among the many j
are some whose efforts, whose self-denials and I
devotions to the public weal, demand our rec- |
ognition. To all of these we extend our most j
royal find cracious thanks; but as in the past
so now we desire to select f om this number
two or three who by their singular devotion,
. and who by their zeal aud u:ibeifi=h desire to
advance the welfare of our people and to ex
tend the prosperity of our land, are entitled to
our special aud worthy notice.
We have, therefore, commanded our Prime
Minister-to state that we have selected three
' worthy citizens, whom we intend to raise to
the Order ol our Knights of La Fiesta, and on
: whom we desire to confer the decoration of 1
" that order.
1 One has singularly devoted' himself. In tho I
line of his official positionâ a position filled by j
him at the request cud upon the wish oi our
1 people â one wtio, in his public capacity, has
ever endeavored to carry out that which we
have believed whs best for the good of our |
realm, showing himself to ba well worthy of
the trust we nav<Â». placed in him as a public
' servant of our royal self.
Another has shown himself to be filled with
1 kindness, with ihoueht, with feelings and i
- with a love for mankind. Out of his own pri
vale fortuue has he made a gift to our people '
which in itself is a principality, and we, the
Queen, leet that in decorating this one wltti
' our order we are assured you will rejoice In
the selection of a mini who has in a most sig
nificant manner shown his unselfish !ove.
The third is cne w;io were it not for this op
portune moment given oy our annual visit,
would be, by reason of bis quiet modesty, but
little rewarded for the great and unselfish in
â  terest hnd publlctpirit ess with which he has
endeavored to do good for this, our provinc?.
.In his devotion to our land, iv his desire to
show to us, his queen, the prosperity of our
people, he has devoted much time and ex
: pended not a little of bis own private fortune
in his endeavor to make our we. come upon
this occasion one of constant happiness and
'enjoyment.
FRANCEBCA, Queen of La Fiesta.
Dated this 20th day of April in the year 1897,
and of our reign the fourth.
I, Prime Minister by royal grace, therefore
command you, captain oi the Queen's Lancers,
to bring before her Majesty Stephen M. White
Griffith Jenkyns Griffith and Ferdinand K.
Rule.
I further command if there are any Knights
of the Order present thsf they act as an escort
of honor in advancing these gentlemen to her
Majesty's throne.
Guards and trumpeters marched down
the line and returned escorting the knight.
They ascended the throne ana received on
their knees the royal favor. Said the
Queen :
" "I, Queen of La Fiesta, do by reason
and by virtue of the majesty of my
. authority pronounce thee Sir Knight, and
order and instruct and command that in
the future you hold and contain yourself
only in honor and uprightness, and to
ever uphold the virtue and the dipnity of
the Order of Knights of La Fiesta."
The graceful ruler decorated the knights,
the trumpets sounded and amid the ap-
J plause of the multitude they retired.
Another distinguished honor was to be.
conferred, and the royal purpose was thus
announced by the Prime Minister:
Hear ye, most favored and loyal subjects of
her Majesty, the Queen ol La Fiesta.
PROCLAMATION.
We, your Queen of La Fiesta, give royal heed
to oao to whom is due our gracious thank*.
Let it be known that it having come to our
knowledge tnÂ«t the celebration of La Fiesta
created for our enjoyment and pleasure and to
welcome our presence, U due to the undivided
efforts of a loyal subject aud a most worthy
citizen of our beloved city.
We therefore are greatly pleased to reward
this conspicuous servant in a lilting and royal
manner.
It is our pleasure that upon this one shall be
conferred a decoration of our owu, heretofore
worn only by your royal self, and that he may
be ordained by virtue of this decoration the
father of La Fiesta and an honorary member of
the order of knights.
. Given under our hand this 20th day of
April, in the year 3807, and of our reign the

I therefore command you, captain of her
Majesty's Koyal L-mcori, to bring before her

gnated in her royal proclamation as one
well tilted to receive this great and royal
honor. I further direct you. Hr nights, one
and all, to proceed with the Royal Lancers and
conduce this one before her Majesty.
Mr. Meyberg was escorted to the stage
the people applauding at every stop.while
the band played "Hail to the Chief." : i
The medal was bestowed and the Queen 1
called upon her ladies of the court to per
form for her the minuet. The guards 'â '<

who. by the way, were all en masque,
marched to the opposite sides of the room
and then retired in single tile behind the
stage, leaving the ballroom free. The
ladies and gentlemen of tbe court took
the:r places on the floor, and with no
sound save the string music and under
the changing colors of two calcium lights,
the other lights being extinguished, went
through the figures of the minuet. It was
a very beautiful and fascinating perform-
ance.
During the dance the floor committee
formed the makers on each side of the
hall, to the ri^ht and lelt of the queen,
uuder the balconies, and as tbe ladies and
gentlemen of the minuet retired all was
iv readiness for the ball ;o begin.
"Let the merry dance proceed; lay
aside all care and let freedom and joy
reign until the break of day," was the
edict from the throne, and the grand
march began, the masters tiling past the
throne and then winding about the big
ball, their varied costumes forming a
spectacle that called out the applause of
tne onlookers as the stiifting colors of the
calcium lights played upon them with
\ eird effects. The guard' had previously
taken its position on the floor again, as at
the reception of the Q ieen, and the mask
ers marched down tue line, saluting the
Queen as they arrived in front of the
turone. The guard, when all had passed,
marched up the hall behind them and
took positions about the throne. The
band struck up a waltz and the ball was
in full swing.
At a little before midnight the Queen
called upon the dancers to remove their
masks. The trumpeters had another
turn, tbe guards took their position on
the floor, the maskers marched down the
Hue and coming before tne Queen each
couple removed their masks, saluting,
and with that the dance went on and on.
Out at tbe tribunes another number of
tbe programme was also performed to
night. The performers were a band of
Mission Indians. The promoters of the
hepta introduced something ol a novelty
into the pro rrmme when they per
suaded, not without considerable diffi
culty, over a hundred of the braves of the
missions to visit Los Angeles and exem
plify their ceremonial observances lor the
benefit of the merry-makers.
The visitors are not altogether uu
unfamiliar with civilized habits, inas
much as Po-I'a-Cbunk, ex-captain of the
Coahuilas, placidly smoked a cigar this
evening and manipulated a broomstick,
while participating in the ensemble of a
scalp dance.
The tribe Is accompanied by a large
chorus of squaws, who chant in a minor
fcey wbile tbe dance- are in progjess.
The spectacle this evenins was quite irn
prevsfT*, A large tire cast a lurid slow
upon tbe halt-nude bodies of the braves,
whose skins wÂ«re almost hidden beneath
a fantastic covering of pigment. Their
heads were ornamented with leathers and
their faces streaKed with war paint. Their
loin cloths reproduced the fiesta colors.
Viewed when roused to a tierce pitch of
frenzy, as they stamped, grunted and
lnughed with ferocious energy and unan
imity during the mystic evolutions of the
drouth or the rain dance, tney presented a
terrifying appearance, which was proba
bly their cherished object.
The las: and most interesting feature of
the programme was the tire dance by thirty
male and female Indians. Though the
performers did not actually comply with
the terms of the announcement, that they
would literally extinguish a well-devel
oped tire by dancing upon it with their
naked feet and rolling over it with their
almost nude bodies, they displayed a suf
ficiently wDndei ful capacity for enduring
neat to make the event exciting, and the
tire eventually burned itself out.
GOWNS AND DECORATIONS.
In Point of Magnificence AM For
mer Fiestas Have Been
Excelled.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 20.â 1n
point of beauty of decorations and magnifi
cence of costumes tna tiesia of '97 excels
any of its predecessor!.
Hazard's Pavilion, the ecene of the
baile mascara to-night, was ablaze with
electric lights and the fiesta colors â yel
low, green and red â that typify in this
annual merry-making the orange, olive
and wine. The interior of the building
was covered solidly in yellow as a back
ground for the other colors. From the
center of the ceiling ropes of pmilax were
carried to the corners of the room hung
w:th numerous red Japanese lanterns
titled with the same graceful vine, giving
the effect of banging baskets of growing
p lants. At the center, whence these lioei
diver-red, a long pendent of Japanese um
brellas was arranged, graduating in size
from twelve to iwo feet, and at every
point of each shone a colored electric
light. Where the ropes were fastened at
the corners two umbrellas were hung and
lighted in the same way.
The proscenium arch in front of the
stage was effectively ornamented with
liesta flags and red lanterns. The Queen's
throne wÂ»a covered wiih red satin and on
each side of the broad stairs leading up to
it were solid beds of flowers of the game
briliii'.nt hue. On either side of this stair
way below the throne the musicians were
screene l from the dancers by bamboo
trellises tilled in with broad-leaved palms
and leathery ferns. The entrance at the
opposite end of the room was concealed in
a similar manner.
From the gallery and balcony lanterns
and pennants fluttered in profusion, white
the supporting pillars was twined thickly
with ivy, and across each alternate arch
extended a low bamboo fence masted with
green foliage and palms.
The general effect of this combination
of brilliant color was gorgeous and strik
ing, consistent with the spirit of the me; ry
maskers rather than dignified and ele
gant. In the decorations were 50 umbrel
las and 1000 lanterns, and nobody knows
how many thousand of electric lights were
used.
This, with the ornamentation of the
carriages for the Queen and court, the
Jonathan and Athletic Club turnouts and
several other of the most attractive fea
tures of La Fiesta, was resigned by Mrs.
Annie Bancroft's artistic taste.
It is questionable whether real royalty
is clothed in richer fabricÃ on ceremonial
occasions than were Queen Francesca and
her mimic court. Tne costumes of the
brilliant reign of Louis XVI of Prance
were the ones her Majesty chose for her
prime minister and the lords ana ladies
in waiting, with the privilege of wide lati
tude in the exercise of individual taste.
The Queen's coronation robe was fash
ioned oi cream brocade, hoavy with gold
thread. The bodice was cut square in the
neck, trimmed with gold passementerie.
tne sleeves short, revealing the upper part
of the arm. The bodice front is cascaded
with rare old lace, which with her dia
monds is an heirloom in her family.
From a light gold lace collar in the
back fall yards and yards of purple vel
vet in the regal train. This is lined with
cream satin, trimmed with ermine and
fastened at the shoulder with diamond
pins.
A jeweled girdle encircled the waist;
tne handle of her scepter and crown were
set with diamonds and nearls. A dia
mond necklace clasped the white throat
of the girl queen, and the lace front of
her bodice was caught with the same
slowing gems.
Queen Francesca's uncle, John F.
Frances, previous to his departure for
Europe, presented her witu the crown

and girdle, as souvenirs of her reien, and
she is the first sovereign of La Fiesta who
has possessed these accessories of royalty.
The robe to be worn at the concert on
Wednesday evening is a "dream" in pale
pink and Nile green brocade. The bodice
is trimmed in pearl passementerie and
gathered full in the front with pale green
chiffon. From the high collar, orna
mented with pearls, falls a train of rich
cardinal velvet lined with green satin and
trimmed with ermine. This is fastened
with diamonds at the shoulders and orna
ments of the same worn with it.
Yellow is the Queen's favorite color and
the one which will bring out her rich
Spanish beauty to the best advantage.
She has selected tbis bright tint for the
robe to be worn in the floral parade of
Friday. The gown is of cream and yellow
brocade with a short sleeve bodice, a full
front of duchesse point lace and garniture
of passementerie studded with topaz. The
train is of shimmering satin that catches
the light and shade like a bed of Califor
nia poppies and reflects all their grada
tions of color. This, like the preceding,
is finished with ermine and *ined with
cresm satin.
For athJetic day there is a dainty pink
organdie made over cream siik, with col
lar and girdles of pearls. With this will
be worn a silk mull hat, ui.h while
ostrich plumes an I pink roses and a para
sol in the same shades. Should the wind
De chill the royal shoulders will be pro
tected by a cream brocade cape with a
high ruff of mousseiine de soie and os
trich trimmings.
Each costume has its fine silk Hosiery
and aainty slippers to match, with dia

In the street parade to-morrow after
noon her Majesty will appear in her cor

sleeves.

Ttie Queen's Prime .Minister, Mr. Fran
cis J. Thomas, wore a Louis XVI cos
tume ot cream satin, knee-breeches and
square cut jacket, elaborately trimmed
with gold lace and builion fringe ou the
epaulettes. A silk shirt with lace
re fries, eatin turban, white silk dose, and
gilt shoes completed this striding <lress,
which was very becoming to she Prime
Minister's Handsome iigure. His costume
for tiie various ceremonies of the week,
upon all of which he will be the (Queen's
attendant, is of black velvet, laced with
pink ribbon, hose of the same shade, with
velvet cap and binclc shoes.
Frederick K. Rule, upon whom the
order of knighthood waÂ» conferred and
who is president of La Fiesta committee,
wore a Spanish court costume of the rich
est material. The rulUes of the silk shirt
were of point ducnesse lace. The knee
breeches and bolero were of cream and
gold brocade, heavy with gold lace and
bullion. The buttons up the sides of the
breeches were rubies, moonstones and
pearls, set with diamonds, which, with the
diamond stars that clasped the garters,
the shoe buckles and the pins in tbe lace
frill of the shirt, were gems of the purest
water. A satin turban, yellow hose and
gilt shoes completed this rich and re
splendent costume.
The sixteen ladies-in-wai ting of her
Majesty's court, who opened the ball witn
the stately, old-time minuet, were divided
into four set?, each set adopting a scheme
of color as its own. The one exception to
this was Mrs. Granviile McGowan, the
first lady, who wore an exquisite costume
of pink and pale blue. Tue petticoat was
of pink satin with a gold embroidered,
jeweled front. The pointed bodice and
long paniers were of rich brocade, with
pale blue ground and pink satin Mowers.
The garniture of the bodice was juweled.
with tulle vest; pink satin slippers and
diamond ornaments.
J. D. (.ook, her partner, wore a pink
satin costume of the same period.
Mrs. Oiheman A. Stevens wore a cerise
skirt witn pointed bodice and thort
paniers of crexm satin brocaled with
cerise roses. The trimming was rare
French iace, brought from Paris by her
mother.
Miss Florence Silent's costume was
cerise skirt, pale blue pompadour brocade
paniers and bodice; sleeves and fichu of
blue chiffon, with pearl ornaments. .
Mrs. Jack Fester wore a costume of
white si.k with cerise brocade bodice and
paniers. The garnitur* of the bodice was
duches-e lace with diamond ornaments
and white siippers.
The gentlemen of the set were H. S.
McKee, Bert Williams and Will Bishop,
whose costumes were white satin knee
breecnes, short jackets, lace ruffled silk
shirts and white 'hoes.
Mrs. Edward Silent wore a petticoat of
pink silK witn budice and panicia of a
deeper shade, upon which rose pink
chrysanthemums of velvet were ap
p.iqueri. Tbe sleeves and front of the
boa ice were of tulle, caught with rhine
stones.
Mrs. Godfrey HolterbofJ. Mrs. Will
Bisnop and Aliss Bor.ten carried out the
same scheme of co.ors in their costumes.
The gentlemen wore pink satin knee
breeches with square-cut jackets. They
werÂ«3 MeÂ«srÂ«. Godfrey Honeruoff, Jack
Foster, Charles Henderson aim E. A.
Silent.
The "yellow set" wore costumes oj that
hue in satin -kirts and brocaded bodices
and paniÂ«rs trimmed in chiffon and gold

Mrs. J. T. Jones and Charles D ck; Miss
Altuu Robinson and Jack Austin; Mr.
and Mrs. Suiuner P. Hunt; Mis* Blancne

The ladies of the "Nile-green set" were
attired in p?tticoals of that delicate shade,
with brocaded overdrefs-s in cream and
green. Tne trimmings were lace and tulle,
arranged accoiding to taste, with white
slippers and diamoad ornaments. The
gentlamen were dressed to correspond
with the costumes of their partners. The
couples forming this set were: Miss Alyce
Keenan and Mr. Weyraan; Mr. and Miss
Newmark; Miss Christine Kurtz and Dr.
Williams; Miss Mabel Kendall and Mr.
Johnson.
The ladies of the court all wore pow

bons on the end to match the dress and
email silver fans. The skirts were short
and the dress throughout carried out the
styles of the French court of that time.

consistent with other details of the dress.
The costumes were all made by modistes
and costumers of Los Angeles.

picture hats made of white mull trimmed
in white plumes and flowers to blend with

LIBERALS SWEEP NOVA SCOTIA.
7 he Conservatives More Hopelessly Beaten
Than Ever Before at the Fourth
General Election.
HALIFAX, N. 8.. Aprii 20.â T0-day,
after a three years' session, the fourth
general election in Nova Scotia was held.
On each occasion tha Liberals have tri
umphed, to-day's victory for them being
the moat signal oi all.
By the crushing blow the Liberals have
for toe fifth time dealt to the Conserva
tives they have added five years more to
their lease of power and made their total
period of rule twenty years, for the com
ing term of Parliament will be rive years.
Such a record is unprecedented in the
annals of any party in the Canadian Con
federacy. Out of eighteen counties, send
ing thirty-eight members to tbe Assem
bly, the Conservatives succeeded in elect
ing only five members â possibly s;x. The
city of Halifax gives the largest Liberal
majority ever polled by that party. One
of tbe issues raised by the Liberals who
asked for the votes oi the people was a
protest against men of their own party
who ware pledged to the removal of duties
on goal.

White Asks Some Questions
That Annoy the Alabama
Senator.
It Is Time That the United States
Checks Outrages Committed
by Spaniards.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 20.â 1n the
Senate to-day the subject of chief interest
was the joint resolution introduced some
time ago by Morgan declaring a condition
of public war exists Cuba, and strict neu
trality should be maintained by the United
State?. When taken up Morgan stated in
reply to a question by White of California
that it was Ris purpose to get a vote to
day. He said:
"Its passaee will have some effect in
staying the terrible, outrageous and abom
inable conduct reported day after day as
occurring in Cuba. The Committee on
Foreign Relations has just examined a
very enlightened gentleman, an English
man, who has been there, and disclosures
which he made of the situation in Cuba
were such that it is morally impossible
that the people of the United States can
continue to delay making some demand
upon the executive for interposition to
prevent the horrors occurring there."
"Tne Senator," said White, "is a mem
ber of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, and is familiar with its business
transactions. I wish to inquire of him
whether testimony that has been taken
before committee and has been reduced
to writing will be printed, so it can be in
spected?"
Morgan said resentfully: "Of course;
we do not do things in the dark."
"lam not insinuating anything of tbe
kind," White explained.
"What is the insinuation, if it is not
that?" Morgan asked.
"I make no insinuations," White re
plied. "I have no idea of aoing anything
of the kind; I simply asked a civil ques
tion. I heard it intimated that the Presi
dent has sent a Senator of standing to in
vestigate and report as to affairs in Cuba.
I would like to know whether the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations Is advised
that that is being done, and if so, whether
it wouldn't be wise to await the result of
that examination, when possibly rumors
that have been crystallized in the newspa
per reports will he verified or otherwise."
"For years," Morcan replied, "these
rumors have been crystallizing into news
paper reports, and neither the Senator
from California nor any other Senator has
cot on the floor and denied them. The
Senator from California has as good
sources of information as Spain can give
him. When American and English news
papers publish the same thing I begin to
feel that it is time we accept something as
being true.'"
The subject went over in the absence of
Hale.
A resolution was offered by Cnllom call
in* on the Secretary of the Treasury for
information as to whether the hijrh rates
of taxation on distilled spirits have re
sulted in an increase of illicit distilleries,
and what the rates of taxation should be
to produce the greatest amount of revenue
consistent with the protection of bone-u
distillers and dealers. It went over till
to-morrow.
The agricultural appropriation bill was
packed.
The bankruptcj bill was discussed. The
vote on Nelson's substitute will probably
occur to-morrow.

House and of an alleged faction of the
Republican majority to force Speaker
Reed to permit oiher legislation than the
tariff and appropriation bills to be enacted
at the present extraordinary session of

to pressure from outside influences that
may prova more potential that those
within the House. Within the past two
weeks a large number of petitions from
business men and business organizations
all over the country have been received
by members of Congress, including the
Speaker, all on the following printed
beading:
To Our Kcprctentativcs in Congress: Your un
dersignttd constituents and fellow-citizens re
spectfully and earnestly present to you the
necessity for reform in our National currency
and oanlcing legislation and our belief that
such reform must be in the shape of well
digested and deliberate legislation which may
bs best provided for by authorizing the Presi
dent to appoint a commission as proposed by
the Indianapolis monetary convention. There
fore we have the honor to request that you
favor the granting of such authority to the
President during the present extra session.
This is a scheme and evidently a result
of the efforts of n: embers of the commit

Government Officials to Make a Survey of

' Question R; vivid. "> : *
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 20. -The
party of Coast and Geodetic Survey offi
cials who are to make a survey of the seal
rookeries on St. Paul Island, in the Bering
Sea, lei Washington to-night. They de
parted ten days earlier than expected,
owing to the desire of the treasury offi
cials to have their work done as speedily
as possible. The revenue cutter Bear will
carry the party and will sail from Seattle
on the 4tb or sth of May. The survey will
take all summer and will be conducted by
W. W. Duffield Jr., son of the Superin
tendent of the Coast Survey.
In this connection interest is revived in
the convention; now pending in the Sen
ate for ratification, providing for the loca
tion and marking by permanent monu
ments of the one hundred and forty-first
meridian boundary line between British
Columbia and Alaska, north of Mount St.
Ellas. Senator Davis will probably press
it upon the attention of the Senate after
the arbitration treaty is disposed of.
It was learned to-day tuai the provision
in the convention relating to making
Mount St. Bias the stanging point of the
boundary line is ' merely by permission,
inasmuch as the mountain lies near to
the junction of the len-raarine-league
line and the one hundred and forty-hrst
meridian. Toe. convention provides that
if the Commissioners of the two countries
deem it desirable ana advisable so to do
they may fix the starting point there.
Should the Commissioners elect to start
from tlie summit of the mountain the
United States will gain au area of thirteen
square miles in extent. The location by
the Coast Goedetic Survey of the meridian
at Sixty-mile Creek has not as yet been
tested by the Canadian surveyors. All
of the gold-bearing fields are within the
Territory of Alaska. They consist of
mines on Forty-mile and Sixty-mile
creeks and Birch Creek and placer dig
ging* at Cooks Inlet. "â¢.' \f, â¢â  y -^

Failure of an Attempt to
Defeat the General's
Confirmation.
Enemies of the Officer Try in
Vain to Prevent His Pro
motion.
Senator Hawley of the Military
Affairs Committee Says the
Nomination Is Satisfactory.
WASHINGTON, P. CL, April 20. -The
enemies of Colonel Shafter, who was re
cently promoted to be a brigadier-general
in the Foiled States army, will not suc
ceed in their attempt to defeat his con
firmation.
There has been considerable speculation
at the War Department here as to the
cause of the delay in confirming the nom
ination of Colonel Shafter. The Call
. inquired of several mem
hers of the Military Affairs Committee of
the Senate whether there was any signifi
cance in the delay in acting upon the
nomination. Tney said "No," but still a
little suspicion lurked in the minds of the
army officers that there was "a nigger in
the woodpile."
The suspicion has been coniirmed, for
alter diligent inquiry The Call corre
spondent learned to-day that cbnrees bed
been riled with the Military Affairs Com
mittee aeainst General Shafter. It ap
pears that when he was a captain, y-Â»ars
ago, General Shafter incurred the enmity
of some ottioers, several of ffbom were his
superiors. It is said that BDaftef once
found it necessary to imprison in a guard
house a brother of Schofield, afterward
general in command of the army and now
retired.
It appears also that years aeo one of the
army officers made some charges against
Shaiter, which were dismissed as ground
less. Snafter afterward had this man dis
charged from the army. The latter now
joins hands witn other enemies of Gen
eral Shatter in an effort to prevent his
confirmation and injure his reputation,
but their aachinations will not prevail,
for Ihe Call correspondent to-night re
ceived a positive assurance from Senator
Hawley, chairman of the Committee on
Military Affairs, that on Thursday next.
tne commiaee would report the nomina
tion of Shafter as brigadier-general favor
ably to tne S2nate, and this will bo equiv
alent to his confirmation. General Shafter
is now at the Eobitt House in this city.

Ha. >of Guilty of Murrtrr.
WICHITA, Kan>., April 20.â About
three years ago two cousin?, Cnarley and
.Tease Hibden of Pauls Valley, I. T., to
gether with a cook named George Jones,
left that place and went to Arkansas, their
purpose being to trade horses for cattle.
The Hibdens never returned and Jones
was suspected of their murder. He was
arrested and on purely circumstantial
evidence convicted of murdering the two
Hibdens after a sensational trial. Charred
bones found in the remains of a camp tire
and supposed to be those of the missing
men were the strongest witnesses against
him.
Jones insisted that he was innocent, and
on the scaffold declared thai Jesse Hib
den was a party to the murder, if not the
priuc.pal. but Jesses bones were supposed
to hay*.' been fou:id in the ashes where the
murderers had cremated tneir victims to
cover up the crime. Jones had influ
ential re atives and they exhausted every
resource in their efforts to secure a com
mutation of the sentence to life imprison
ment. It now develops that Jesse Hibden
is alive and well, and is himself serving a

OMAHA'S ELECTIOX.
Jhe. Republican Force* Carried Every
thing in night. .
OMAHA, Kebp... April 20.â first
municipal campaign under the new char
ter closed to-ni~ht. The Republican
forces carried everything in sight. A
complete set of officers of the city was
elected. The campaign was very spirited
on all sides. Silver issues were a feature
of the campaign, the Democrats, Pop
ulists and Silver Republicans recombin
ing against the straight Republican ticket.
In addition the fusion force* used as their
war slogan. "Remerobsr 1903 and Bryan."
They opened silver headquarters and
made a great flourish, but it does not seem
to have counted for much, though the
majorities by which the Republicans are
elected are about a half less than McKin
lÂ«*y ; s majority over Bryan in Omaha in
November. However, the silver forces
are referring to the contest as a victory in
asmuch as McKinley's majority was re
duced.
The A. P. A. issues were not altogether
absent, though not so prominent as the
hist election. The Mayor-elect, Frank E.
Moore, is neither a Catholic nor an
A. P. A., and received the support of an
element in both parties. His opponent,
Senator Edward Howell. is common. y re
ported to be an A. P. A. The balance of
the ticket elected is A. P. A.
HEATH OF HILLY BIRCH.
7/10 Old-Time California Minttrel Suc
cumb*. to I'urnly
NEW YORK., N. V. t April 20â Billy
Birch, the old-time California Minstrel,
die I this afternoon in a small room on
the top floor of 70* Seventh avenue. He
had been sice with paralysis for more
ti>an a month, and it was known that he
could not survive the attack. In 1895 he
was first stricken, but recovered, and
about two months ago he had another
stroke while walking on the street. He
was arrested on the supposition that he
was intoxicated and taken to the police
court, where he was discharged. Four
weeks ago last Sunday night Birch sus
tained a third stroke. He was attending a
meeting of the Elks and had to be taken
home in a carriage from the lodgeroom.
He was conscious to the last and died at
3 o'clock. His wife was with him, as
vert some of his fellow-Elks, who bore
the expenses of bis illness. He will be
buried by them from their hall, probably
on Sunday.

NEW YORK, N. V., April 20.â A heavy
frost last night in all the Eastern States
and as far south as Maryland did great
damage to frails and earl y vegetables.
Ice formed in the Delaware up "to noon.
Laic peach which were the first to blos

MURDERED WHILE HE SLEPT.
Charles McCormick, a Stone Mason, Put
to Death b> a Negro and'
Robbd.
WICHITA, Kaxs.. April 20.â A horrible
murder was committed near Davis, I. i\,
yesterday, the victim being Charles Me-
Cormick, an old stone mason of Ardmore,
who lived in a tent in the outskirts of the
town. He lived alone, and had been
working on some new buildings going uo
in Davis. He was murdered as he slept,
and his head was horribly cut and bruised
by blows from an ax which was found
\vherÂ« the murderer had left it in the blood
bespattered tent. Suspicion pointed to
Frank Brown, a negro living not far dis
tant, but before the officers reached his
house Brown had flea. He was traced by
hiu bare footprints to the outskirts of the
town, end later was apprehended on Caddo
Creek. He was absolutely naked, except
a shirt, and was found under a ledge of
rocks buried in sand and water in the bed
of the creek to escape detection. He was
taken to Ardmore in irons aud placed in
jail. The officers also arrested his wile as
an accomplice.
The deed was promoted by his desire to
rob McCormick of $5. his week's wages.
Search was made among the dead man's
papers for a clew to the whereabouts of
his relatives, but nothing has yet been
learned. McCormick was a well-known
character at Aramore, and the citizens of
that town are very much wrought up over
the cowardly murder.
RESCUE OF MANY
FLOOD SUFFERERS
Hundreds Found Hud
dled Together on a
Neck of Land.
Others Given Temporary Relief
in Freight Cars, Which
Are Crowded.
The Town of Delta Is Now Several
Feet Under Water and the
Population Has Left.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 20.â The
Biggs crevasse in Madison parish nas
overflowed forty-two large plantations in
Madison and 3.'00 acres of land planted or
under cultivation. The town of Delta is
under several feet of water. The entire
population has emigrated to Vicksburg
except a few families in the suburbs.
Refugees from Kilerekrankie, Ashland
and Somerset have been taken to Vicks
burg.
At Sareents Point 600 refrgees congre
gated on a narrow strip of iand three feet
wide and 100 yards long. They had
been on this little neck for a week, sleep-
ing in the open air, cooking their meals
by campfires and being in hourly dread
they might be swept away.
Some of the refugees whose houses
stood on low ground were caugnt in lofts
and compellea to cut their way out
throueh the roofs. The mail service over
tne Vicksbur^', Shreveport and Pacific
Railroad was finally abandoned by skiff.
The situation in the overflowed section
of the Mississippi has greatly improved
during the last few days. The Yazoo and
Mis3is;-ipi)i Valley road is rapidly coming
out of the water and is able to run trains
further every day.
The sentiment in the delta is decidedly
optimistic. It is believed the Glascock
crevasse in Concordia parish was caused by
beavers, who entered the new levee and
undermined, thus causing the break. The
scare at New Orleans over the Carrollton
levee has entirely subsided and 600 men
are at work under expert levee builders.
The public is no longer allowed to walk
on the levees. "It any one touches a
levee shoot him on the spot" is the watch
word which has been given out in Jeffer
son parish.
A t Ames 150 men with shotguns man
the levee, at St. Charles SO ana at Bonnet
Carre 100. All strangers are warned
against approaching the levee, and any
skiff loiterine near is fired on. At Bonnet
Carre New Orleans men who proposed
cutting the levee in order to protect the
city were burned in effigy. From New
Orleans forty rales of levees are patrolled
at night by armed men and lighted up by
bonfires and torches around which guards
and workmen gather.
The tracks of the Yazoo and Mississippi
Valley road, which runs through the
overflowed section, have many boxcars on
them at various points in order to accom
modate refugees. Cars standing in the
midst of the flood are now crowded with
negroes. Some of the cars are occupied
by tour and hve families and as many as
thirty persons. The levees are also
crowded with negroes, many of whom are
sleeping out in the open air.
AGAIXST IRK IMPORTERS.
neeinion in a Sal- trimming Cute ln
ralving Many Million.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 20â A
telegram was received at the Treasury
Dspartment this afternoon saying that a
verdict had been rendered in the United
States Circuit Court at Philadelphia
favoring the Government in one of the
noted hat-trimminu cases. The Govern
ment was sustained on every point in
volved. The treasury officials say that
this i- a great victory. Estimates of the
amount involved run ail the way from
$25,000,000 to $50,000,000. various suits
having been brought by importers to
secure the refunding of duties which they
claimed were in excess of the tariff law's
provisions. While to-day's verdict does
not settle other cases pending, it is held
by officials that, the charge of the Judge
practically shuts out any chance ol im
porters to secure refunding.

XBW NIMSIEK TO HAWAII.
young Setvall of Main* to Re Kitcardeil
for I'arty Loyalty.
WASHINGTON. D- C, April 20.âPresi
dent McKinley has selected his Minister
to Hawaii. It is Harold M. bewail of
Maine, son of tho late defeated candidate
for Vice-President on the Bryan and
j-ewall ticket. It will be remembered that
the son and sire differed in their political
views and economic policies. Young
Sewall was for gold money, McKinley and
Hobart, notwithstanding the fact that his
distinguished father was a candidate (or
Vice-President on the Bryan free silver
ticket.
Some shrewd political sharps in Wash
ington surmise that this wai on â¢ of the
sharp family tricks of the Sewails, that
they played both ends against the middle
and stood to win whichever way the elec
tion resulted. However this may be, it is
certain that -young, Sewall is to be re
warded for loyalty , to principle and dis
loyalty to his father.
The Call correspondent to-night re
-1 ceived positive information t at young
Sewall would be appointed Minister to
Hawaii. Mr. Sewail was at the White
House to-day and had a long talk with
tho President. Sewall'a appointment will
dispose of the ambition of . Dudley of San
Diego,; who was one of the live Califor
nians recommended for a foreign mission
by the California Republican delegation
in Congress. The Call correspondent un
derstands that the name of Mr. Dudley
would not have been considered by the
President in any event.
CALIFURXJA I'AIJtOXAGE.
Strained llelattona Between Senator Fir
kin* and Cimgretiman Lout.
WASHINGTON. D. â¢ C, ADril 20.â The
fight between Senator Perkins and Rep
resentative Loud over California patron
age promises to be interesting. The nom
ination of Colonel John 11.I 1 . Jackson as
Collector of Customs at San Francisco is
first blood for Perkins. He stood by his
friend JacJtson nobly, and to-day received
the congratulations of his California
friends over the successful outcome of his
fight. It must not be understood that
Loud opposed Jackson. On the contrary
he joined his Republican associates from
California in indorsing Lino. ' .rfut Loud
wanted McGraw of Santa Clara County
appointed Surveyor. President McKin
ley and Mark Henna, however, agreed to
give the place to Joe Spear of San Fran
cisco, and Senator Perkins offered no re
monstrance to this arrangement. There
upon Mr. Loud grew angry and resolved
that, come what may, he would not allow
Mr. Perkins to "hog" all of the good
things. He inwardly resolved that he
would not recommend the Postmaster for
San Franci co and other towns in his dis
trict which naturally belonged to him,
but would insist upon naming at least
one other Federal officer, either Marshal
or Naval Officer.
It is said that Mr. Load announced to
some friends that unless he was assured
that he would be allowed this privilege he
would no to President McKinlev and shy:
"If you are anxious to reward Mr. Spear,
make him Collec:orof tho PorÂ»."
But the nomination of Jackson as Col
lector to-day disposes of this plan of Mr.
Loud's. It is said that be will now seek
to have one of his friends appointed
United States Marshal. Rumors have it
that Harry N. Morse of Oakland will be
the man named. It appears that Mr.
Loud's son-in-law, Mr. Callundan, is in
business with Mr. Morse and has charje
of the latier's office in his absence. On
account of this relationship it is thought
by Cahfornians here that Mr. Loud will
recommend Morse for Marshal, althonch
this does not seem possible, in view of Mr.
ii aid's statement 10 The Call correspon
dent recently that he did not see bow he
could recommend a man who did not live
in his district.
The nomination of a Unit*"l States Cir
cuit Judge to succeed McKenna is ex
pected every day, and it ia almost certain
that Judge Morrow will b* the man. In
that event the District Attornevship will
be between Waymire, I)<> Haven and
Estee. with chances in favor of VVaymire.
In case Waymire is not appointed Dis
trict Judge he will put out bip lightning
rod for the Attorney-Generalship when
McKenna succeeds Field on ibe Supreme
bench.
O:ie of the Californians aaid to The Call
correspondent to-night that he believed
there might be some truth in the report
that Representative Loud would soon re
tire irom Congress, and ask the President
to appoint him Postmaster of Sfcn Fran
risco. This Californiau said that Mr.
Loud might have a hard and doubtful
fight for renomination to Congress two
years hence. It ia certain, however, thar
unless n treaty of peace is concluded be
tween Perkins and Loud, the former will
take a baud in the postmastership nim
self.
Senator Perkins feels that he has been
generous to his colleagues in inviting
mem to meet with him to discuss Cali
fornia appointments. Most Senators are
allowed to make ail of the Presidential
appointments in their respective States,
including ; the Presidential postmasters'.
Senator . Perkins will not seek to do any
thing of the kind as long as the Republi
can Representatives from California are
disposed to be reasonable, but if there is
any recalcitrant member who seem
anxious for a fight he will give him hi
moneys worth. In other words, if Mr.
Loud is obstreperous Senator Perkins wii
insist upon his right to name the post
master at San Francisco himself, as well
as at Ban Jose and other Presidential
post office s.
The chances of De Young hang in the
balance. . Senator Perkins is rather in
clined to believe that De Young may be
appointed as Minister 1 to Belgium, but
Mr. Loud thinks not. De Young will
probably receive some recognition, though
it may not be a foreign mission of impor
tance. If Dp Young should go to Belgium
Colonel Kowalsky's ambition to be Con
sul-General to Brussels would be Knocked
in the head. It is not probable, however,
that KowalsKy will get anything, whether
Di Young lands or not.
A member of the California delegation
said to The Call correspondent to-night,
"Kowalsky is not in it for anything." ;
â  Senators Perkins and White will accom
pany General Romualdo Pacheco to the
White House to-morrow. At first Pacheco
wanted to go to Mexico, then Brazil; now
he thinks the Argentine Repub ie would
suit him. , The salary is $10,000, but be
will run be appointed to any foreign mis
sion. ;
The chances of Captain William L.
Merry of San Francisco to be Minister to
Nicaragua are considered excellent. All
of the shipping men and commercial
bodies of the Pacific Coast saem to be for
him. Ex-Senator Warner Miller is earn
estly working in his behalf, and so is
Senator Perkins.
Senator Perkins has received from Cali
fornia over 100 applications for appoint
ment to foreign missions and consular
positions. They ar*< from every county
in the State, from Siskiyou to San Diego.
Inasmuch aÂ« there are only 43 foreign
missions ami 250 consulates, it stems im
possible to provide for more than four or
five Californians, as there are fony-four
otder States in tne Union.

NEW YORK, X. V., April 20.â Corbett
to-day challenged Filzsimmons to box
any number of rounds for the world's
championship before the club offering the
largest inducements. The matter ol side
stakes is left to ha settled at Fhzsimmons'
pleasure. Corbett deposited $5000 with
Richard K. Fox, which he asks Fizsim

him to arrange final details. It is not
very lilcely that the challenge will be ac
cented unless Fitz'imruons changes his
mind. Corbett will remain here all sum
mer and do everything possible to force a
match.
Fitzsinimon'*' willingness to give a
chance to Joe Goddard hats caused much
comment in sporting circles. All that i>
necessary tc bring the match to a puint is
Goddard's appearance in America. Billy

have escaped from the inclo>ure in which
he kept them. The 'gators were but a few
inches in length when they were received
from the South by Mr. Dixon, but they
have grown considerably since, and the
last time he saw them they were nearly
six feet lone. A pond, around which was
a suitable ience, was constructed to hold
the amphibians, but about a weet aeo
they managed to escape by knocking out
a couple of pickets with their powerful
taiis.
A close search was instituted for tbe es
capes at once, and it has been in progress
for several days. They have been seen
several times by different persons, but ail
attempts to capture them have failed thus
far. It is said that a few evening? ago a
negro who was working on one of the
nineties, while allowing the cattle to drink
in the river, saw :i black object rise sud
denly from tue water clo^e to the shore,
where a calf was drinking. There was a
sudden swish of an enormous tail and the
calf fell over dead. Immediately another
dark object arose to the surface beside the
first one and together they dragged the
dead calf into ttie water, leaving a wake
of blood.
It is an ill wind that blows nobody
some good, however, and if reports are
true it is likely that the country adjacent
to the islands will again be a breeding
ground for ducks and eee>e. Trie trouble
for years has been that carp have eaten
all the food which is sought by feathered
game, thereby driving winged creatures
to other parts of the country. There is
nothing that suits an alligator so much as
carp, and it is expected that before a great
while there will be no carp in that part of
the river, at least.
The ridding of the river of carp would
be quite a task for two of the huge water
lizards, but they multiply very rapidly
and in a year from now there may be
scores of them cleaviuK the waters of the
San Joaquin, unless the two now at large
are speedily captured or killed. If tnis is
to be done at all it must be done immedi
ately, as the female has already begun to
lay her eggs in the warm sand and a nest
of them was found by an Italian gardener
this morning. They were much larger
eggs than, he had been accustomed to
seeing, so he took them up to his ranch,
where they were pronounced by a colored
man to be alligator eggs. They were im
mediately destroyed, with the. exception
of a couple, which are now on exhibition
at a grocery store on Hunter street.
It is *>aid that Henry Voorman, a young
man who lives on the Mokelumne River,
has also procured a couple of the am
phibian;, with a view to turning them
loose near his place to exterminate the
carp. Voorman is very fond of hunting,
but as the carp have eaten up all the duck
feed near there he is compelled to go sev
eral miles for ducks.
D/S ASTER AT ROSSLAND.
S'jr Laborers on a Mountain Railroad
Crushed to Death by a
Snowsiide.
VANCOUVER, *J. C, April 20. â An
other awful fatality, resulting from a
snowsiide in the mountains, was reported
here to-day. About eight miles from
Kossiani twelve or fourteen laborers on
the Toad Mountain Railroad had finished
;.<heir pipes and gone to sleep, crowded
together in one tent. Or.c of them was
awakened by a noise and went outside
just in time to see a huge snow and mud
slide descend and bury the tent and its
occupants.
Tne engine of a work train was on a
sidetrack cooling off. The survivor
jumped oa the engine and, heaping on
coal, rac^d to Rossland to summon help.
In an hour a force was at work. It seems
miraculous that any of the entombed men
escape.*, but only six of the dozen were
beyond assistance. One man was pinned
down under a tree uninjured. Another,
who had been sleeping under a table, was
saved by the table. The names of the vic
tims are not yet obtainable.

FRESNO JURORS "HEFT" GOLD.
Large Sum of Money Brought Into Court
to Prove a Theory in the Sanders
Case.
FRESNO, Cal., April 20.â 1n the trial
of Professor W. A. Sanders to-day the
jurors were given an opportunity to test
the weight of $20,000 in. gold. Sanders
says that the "mythical" John Knausch
and K. L. Graves carried that amount of
money over the trail across the steep
mountain between Wootton's place and
Hill's valley, where the capitalists left
their '.earn. The jury, on its recent visit
to the ranch from whleb Wootton disap
peared on February 1, MM, walked over
th's trail and found it an arduous climb. '
Today the County Treasurer brought
$20,000 in gold in a bag into court, and the
jurors all took a lift at it.
The weight of the bag was 71., pounds,
and the prosecution contends mat San
ders' story that Knau*ch and Graves cur
ried that amount across the mountains is
absurd.
Kapid progress is being aude la the
trial. Robert Anderson was on the stand
during tbe afternoon. He was a cellmate
with Sanders In the county jail about a
year ago, and the defendant entered into
an arrangement with him to fabricate
testimony when he should be released by
pelting two men to swear that they saw
Wootton, Knnusch and Graves in Los
Angeles after February 1, 1894. Ths state
ments of the testimony these two men
were to swear to were prepared by San

are in the peculiar handwriting of the de

to interfere.
PHfENIX LAWYERS OFFENSE.
City Attorney Arrested for Violating an
Anti-Expectorat/en Ordinance Drafted
by Himself.
PHCENIX, Ariz, April 20. â Price
Evans the City Attorney of Phoenix, finds
himself in rather a peculiar predicament.
Several weeks ago, in obedience to a strong
public sentiment on the subject, Mr.
Evans drafted an ordinance forbidding
expectorating on the sidewalk and then
brought about its passage by the City
Council. Yesterday he was arrested by
Policeman Baity for expectorating on a
walk. This is the lirst arrest under the
new ordinance.
Price i? rather indignant at the arrest,
and is casting about for a lawyer to de
fend mm. The maximum penalty is a
fine of $50 or fifty days in jail. Price
admits that there are no Haws in the
ordinance, and yet tie hates to take the
punishment. As City Attorney it is his
duty to prosecute himself, but this dis
agreeable task he already been taken off
his hands by the retention of Attorney
Will H. Buck to especially prosecute this
case. As these are days ot contention
and absorbing interest in local politics
the case will be pushed to the end.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 1897,
OUTLAWS BATTLE
WITH MEXICANS
Sanguinary Combat in
Lochiel, Across the
Boundary.
Arizona Desperadoes Resist
Soldiers Sent to Bring
Them In.
One or the Raldars Killed and a
Number on Both Sides
Wounded.
NOG ALES, Ariz.. April 20. â "Black
Jack's" band of night riders, which has
terrorized Arizona for several years past,
is minus a member. As a little diversion
from the monotony of stagecoach "hold
ups" and raids on frontier postotlices the
cutthroats crossed the Mexican border
yesterday and proceeded to Lochiel, a
town on tbe boundary, which they prac
tically took possession of, and then un
dertook the stupendous feat of consuming
all tbe whisky it contained. Among the
outlaws were Angel Escalante, George
Brady and several others equally notori
ous, but it is not known to a certainty
that "Black Jack" was with them. When
they recrossed the boundary last night
they bore with them a dead companion,
while back in the town from which they
were fleeing lay a Mexican soldier writh
ine in agony from a mortal wound.
News of a battle between the cutthroats
and Mexican soldiers was brought to
Nonales, Mexico, to-day, by Senor Juan
Salazar, Alcalde of Santa Cruz, a town
thirty miles distant across the boundary.
Senor Salazar came to communicate by
telegraph with the Governor of the State
of Sonora and report the details of the
fight.
Senor Salazar says that a messenger ar
rived post haste from Lochiel yesterday
with the information that a band of
American outlaws was making trouble in
Lochiel. The messenger said the Ameri
canos were drunk, and were shooting at
citizens who had the temerity to thrust
their heads out of doors or windows. Al
ready they had slightly wounded one
man, whom they lired upon as he was
crossing a street.
The Alcalde at once dispatched five
soldiers to Lochiel, believing the trouble-
I some Americanos were only good-natured
I vaqueros who had come to town to
squander their season's wages for mescal.
When the soldiers arrived at Lochiel they
were directed to an adobe saloon, :rom
which "Black Jack's" men had driven
the proprietor and in which the outlaws
were singing aud carousing, while inter
mittently members of the band displayed
their dexterity with pistols by shooting
the neck" from bottles behind the bar.
The solaiers appeared in the doorway of
the adobe and called upon the occupants
to surrender. Their demand was re
ceived with jeers by the Americanos, and
several ballets were fired toward tha door
way.
The soldiers sprang into the room and
answered the fire, the two factions lining
up at opposite ends of the apartment.
For several .uiuutes the reports of pistols
drowned the yells and curses of the com
batants, while the room was tilled with
the smoke from their weapons.
Meanwhile the men of LochieJ, encour
aged by the presence of the soldiers, were
hurrying to the saloon to participate in
the extermination of the hated Arlzonians.
The right, before it had gone on live min
utes, became one-sided, and the outlaws
determined to make a dash for freedom.
They succeeded in forcing their way
through the Mexicans about the door of
the adobe, ran to their horses, which were
tethered some fifty yards away, mounted
and dashed out of town, firing a parting
volley at the soldiers and civilians before
they were out of range. As proof that the
Americanos possessed an abundance of
border "nerve" be it known that instead
of fleeing precipitately they tarried long
enough to carry with them to their horses
the body of one of their number who bad
been killed in the right, and when they
rode from the town this corpse hung limp
before one of the riders, head on one bide
of the horse and feet on the otber. Be
sides the man killed the outlaws suffered
considerably in the matter of wounds, not
one of them escaping unscathed.
On the Mexican side one soldier was
murtaily wounded and bis death was
expected when the last news from Lochiel
reached Santa Cruz. Each of the otber
four soldiers had been wounded, but only
one seriously.
An effort will be made by the officers on
this tide of the line to capture the law
breakers and cause them to be handed
over to the Sonora officials, whose pun
ishment of desperadoes is summary and
generally fatal.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 20.â The
assembly-room of the Concordia Club was
filled to-day with bankers, the attendance
being considerably larger than that of
yesterday. Only one paper was read
that by J. J. Valentine of the Wells- Fargo
Bank on "Bimetallism." Mr. Valentine
quoted numerous opinions from tfce
learned in linance to support bis own
opinion that bimetallism was impractica
ble and impossible of accomplishment be
canÂ»e the governments of Europe and,
after them, the bankers of the world, were
against it.
"If Congress," saia the speaker in con
clusion, "would go to work and recon
struct on bcientific principles our mone
tary ajigiomerat:onâ for I repeat it cannot
be called a systemâ definitely affirm tbe
payment of all obligations on the basis of
the gold standard, retire the greenbacks
and let banks, under proper restrictions
and safeguar.b, ijsue circulating notes
such act ; on would go a long way toward
renewed industrial and commercial ac
tivity.
If the present administration and Con
gress do not act courageously, intelli
gently and definitely, but instead permit
things to drift, the fiatists will not be
slow to take advantage of the situation.
Congress and the administration cannot
escape responsibility. They may as well
prepare, and promptly prepare, to meet
the wild and many-weaponed throng of
silver inflationists who are marching be
hind the tattered, stalking posse of inter- 1
national bimetallism."
James H. Thompson, chairman of the
committee on resolutions, presented reso
lutions indorsing the gold standard, which
were adopted. Resolutions were adopted

Fierce Duel Between

White Spectator Prevented by
the Combatants' Tribesmen
From Interfering.
LEWI6TON, Idaho. April 20.â Tom and
Mike Wilson, brothers, Nez Peicjs In
dians from the reservation, fought a duel
to the death eight miles from this place
yesterday. The right occurred on the Lap
wai road in Soldier Canyon and was wit
nessed by a settler's wiie from a distance.
They first fought on horseback, then dis
mounted and fought on foot.
The attention of the settler's wife was
attracted by the angry screams of the
combatants. A short distance from where
the duel took place there were a half
dozen Indians also watching the scene,
with Frank Harterind, a white man.
When the latter thought the fight had
gone far enough he attempted to put an
cud to it, but the other bucks threatened
his life if he attempted to interfere with
the brothers. In fact Harterind was held
captive until the six non-combatants re
turned to Lewiston, so he could do noth
ing.
Harterind says that at tirst the Wilson
brothers emptied their revolvers at each
other at short range, but not a shot took
effect. When he had the last view of
them the two were in close- quarters, tear
ing at each other like wild beasts.
When the womau's husband returned
in the evening he went to the scene and
found the corpse of Tom Wil3on.
Both brothers had been drinking. Un
til a short time ago they were highly re
spected by the whites and Indians alike.
but they could not stand the prosperity
incident to the disiributioa by the Govern
ment of large sums in payment of ceded
lands. Mike is in jail here. He claims
his brother's horse fell upon and killed
his brother.

FEATS OF STRENGTH
The Second Day of the
Military Tournament at
the Presidio.
Witnessed by a Greater Number
of Citiz3ns Than on the
Previous Day.
A Numbsr of Purely Military Events
Were Presented and They Proved
Exceedingly Interesting.
There was a greater crowd of people to
witness the military tournament at the
Pretidio yesterday than there was on the
first day. There were not less than 10.000
persons who witnessed the many events
which were, in many instances, more cx
ci ting and interesting than on the previous
day.
Some of the More Interesting Events Which Enlivened the Day at the Presidio Yesterday.
The first event on the programme yes
terday was a Continuation of the 120-yard
hurdle race, ten flights over hurdles 3
feet 6 inches high. Cameron ol Battery D.
Angel Island, won in 18 2 sseconds. Car
tT, Company D, Benicia, second, and
(J.'enny, Troop I, Presidio, third. Raines
<'. Battery E, Fort Mason, fell on making
the last but one and lost his chance of
winning.
The event that followed was the contin
uation of the mounted broadsword con
test, which was much mere exciiinc than
it was on the preceding day. The con
testants were Souvieski of troop X and
Davis of Troop B, Pre^dio. The winner
was Davis â 5 points to 4.
The next event was the pole-vault for
height. For this there were seven entries
and. for amateurs, the men diii well in
tneir efforts to come up to the world's
record, which is 11 feet 7 inches. The
â¢winner was Fernandez of Troop X, Pre
sidio, height 8 ieet 9 inches. Hinton of
Battery H, Angel Island, was second, and
Daubenspeck of Battery E, Fort Mason,
third.
The next was a military event, known
as common tent-pitching. For this there
were four entries â a team from Battery
E, Fort Mason; toe second from Company
A, Presidio: the third from Baitery H,
Angel Inland; and the fourth from Com
pany C, Benicia. Tne test was for rapid
ity in Ditching the tents, with the pees
well driven, the walls rolled for inspec
tion and the men in line in the position
of ;he soldier. This was won by Com
pany C, Beniciaâ time, 3:23 1-5; Company
A, Presidio, second.
After that came the one-mile run, the
world's record lor which is 4:15 3-5. There
were eight entries. The race was won by
Chulmars of Company H, San Dieeo;
time 5:23 4-5; Dougherty of Company B,
Benicia, was second and ilogan, Battery
F, Presidio, third.
After that came tha blank-cartriage
lace, which is a substitute for the Dotato
race. Five cartridges were placed on
email piecea of paper at ten-yard inter
vals, and were brought in one at a tim<*
end placed in the magazine of a rifle left
at scratcn. After the last cartridge had
been placed in position the rifle was
loaded and tired in the air as a signal of
completion. The winner wai Prictcett of
Company G, Presidio; time 1:02 2-5;
'Â»' Marie, Company <), Benicia, second,
and Brunotte, Company H, Ban Diego,
third.
The next event was one that was
watched with interest by the many on
lookers. It i s what is known as walt
scalinÃ in light marching order. The
wall was a close- board fence, ten feet
high, with a four-inch. c*p piece on the
top. The men who contended ware at*
tired in campaign dress, equipped with
rifle, bayonet and scabbard, woven car
tridge belt and 100 rounds of ball car
tridges, blanket rolled in shelter tent and
carried slung across the shoulder; a haver
sack containing Knife, fork, spoon and
meat can. a canteen filled with water and
a tin cup.
This feat is no easy one, for it requires
agility and considerable strength. This
was the mo*t exciting event of the day.
There wore two heats. The first was won
by a team of Eattery E, Fort Mason, in 41
seconds, and the second heat was won by
the team company from D, Benicia, in 35
seconds. Ihe iinal heat will come off to
day.
The running broad jump followed, wiÂ»h
eight entries. Fernandez of Troop X,
Presidio, was first, 18 feet 9 inches; Cam
eron, Battery D, Angel Island, second,
and Kramer, Company H, Benicia, third.
Another military event was mounted
wrestling, bareback. There were two men
in each of the two heats. In the first set
were Balch of Troop B and Harr;son of
Troop I, both of the Presidio, and in the
second Fritz of Battery F and Souvleskv
of Troop X, also of the Presiiio. The men
were attired in campaign dress, merino
blouse and hat. The contest in this event
is lost by a fall from the horse, one foot on
the ground being called a fall. The con
test is also lost by striking or kicking an
opponent's horse. The final heat waÂ« won
dv Batch, Troop B, Presidio, and Souvleski
won the second heat by default.
A litter-bearer race next attracted atten
tion, an<l for this tliere were three entries:
Davis of Bittery H, Alcatraz; Guyer of
Troop X, Presidio, and Whitlor of Com
pany A, PresMio. The men ran to a cer
tain point. Each picked up a man whose
limbs werÂ» bound and carried him to
scratch. Guyer and W'liitlor tied, while
Davis fell behind. They ran again and
Guyer was the winner in 22 1-5 seconds.
A relay race between teams from Troop
j K. Presidio; Company A, Presidio, and
i Company C, Benicia, was an event that
j attracied much attention. The teams,
consisting of ten men each, all from the
same organization, were divided into two |
detachments, nlaceil opposite each other '
| along lines 100 yanis apart. It then be- j
came the duty oi the men to carry an ofti- i
I cial envelope across and back over the !
! space intervening between detachments j
i ten times â 100 yards b7 each man. Tnis
[ was very exciting and interesting. The
team from Company C, Benipia, won in
2:12 2-5. The team from Company A,
i Presidio, was second and the one from :
I Troop X third.
The two-mile bicycle race thon came on I
j with five entries. The men had a hard
i wind to wheel against and considerable
I uphill grade on making the north turn.
j The winner was Bass of Company H of
I San Diego, Roberts of Battery E, Fort
Mason, second, and Kielty of Troop X,
Presidio, third.
A one-mile walk, in which there were
five entriesâ Hollis of Battery F, Presidio j
; Rasmussen of Battery H, Angel Island;
Ward, A Infantry, Presidio; Wall, Com-
I pany H, Han Diego, and Yanbred, Com-
Dany D, Benicia â followed. Yanbred won i
in 9% minutes. Wall of Company H, Ban j
Diegu. second.
At 4:30 o'clock the final event for the
day was called. Tins was the tug-of-war
between a team from Company B, Benicia,
and one from Company G, Presidio. The
former won in 2:40.
Then there was a pull between the team
from Ar.gel Island and the one from the
Presidio, winners on the previous day.
The pull lasted five minutes and was
awarded to Battery I of Angel Island, it
having gained three-quarters of an inch ot
ro;>e.
To-dey the tournament will continue,
commencing at 1:30 o'clock. There is on
the programme a continuation of waii
scaling and mounted wrestling, a 440-yard
go-as-you-please race, the men being in
heavy marching order; an 8Â»u-yard bicycle
race, men in light marching orcier; con

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 1897.
JUST LAUGHING IT
OUT OF THE COURT
That Is How the Marriott
Libel Charge Is
Going.
Lawyers for the Prosecution
Cause Most of the
Levity.
It Is Apparent That There Is No
Serious Expectation of Securing
a Verdict.
"Hare yon ever been 8 shareholder in
the IlÃle & Norcross Mining Company V
asicea Deputy District Attorney Hinkle of
Talesman Gambitz in Judge Daingerfield's
court yesterday morninp.
"What has the Hale & Norcrons Com
pany to do with this case?" demanded S.
M. Shortridge, representing Editor Mar-
riott of the News Letter, who is charged
with libel for critieiz-ng Judee J. C. B.
Hebbard while the latter was a candidate
for re-election.
"Well, I'll jast say that this is not the
main case. It is the examination of citi
zens who have been drawn as jurors," re
sponded Mr. Hinkle rather curtly.
"And right now I give noiire that I shall
object to qaestious that trench upou mat
ters outside the issues in this case," was
Mr. Sbortridge'a reply.
Mr. Sbortridge was proceeding to argue
the matter under discussion, when Mr.
Hinkle withdrew the question, and tacitly
acknowledged Mr. Suortridge's position
to be correct, whiJe court, counsel and
jurors joined in suppressed merriment.
Then it was Mr, Shortrid^e's turn to in
terrogate the tulesniau. He took up the
right of an editor to criticize candidates
for positions on the bench, and iound that
Mr. Gambitz thought ail citizens ought to
be considered on an equality in this re
gard.
"Did you read about the fact that Judge
Hebbard, the prosecuting witness in mis
case, appointed General John H. Sheehan
receiver of the People's Home Savings
Bank?" asked Mr. Shortridge.
Trie cent. emau remembered something
nbout it, but was not very clear as to the
details, so the lawyer continued: "Did
you rea I that the Supreme Coujt reversed
Judge Uebbard and declared the appoint
ment ot General Sheehan to be null and
void, and that Judge Hebbard rcappointed
him; that the bupreme Court again
knocked out the appointment, and that
for the third time he was appointed by
Judge Hebbard?"
Mr. Gambitz wasfsomewhat hazy in his
recollections touching the bankruptcy ot
the People's Home Savings Bank and
General Bheehan's connection thÂ«rewith.
Then Mr. Snortridge launched another
interrogation in this way:
"Do you think it is right for a Judge to
have a favorite and appoint him over and
over for the purpose of securing a large
income for him?"
Mr. Hinkle objected vigorously and
made an eloquent speech, saying that he
thought no such inquiries ought to be
propounded.
In his argument to support the legality
of i, is question Mr. Shortridge said he
believed tie had a right to investigate tne
feelings of a talesman toucning the acts
of a Judge who would pile appointments
on a favorite to such an extent that the
appointee would receive three times as
much *s the salary of the Judge himself.
He submitted that such favoritism was a
legitimate subject for scrutiny and thai
he was entitled to know the state of tne
talesman* judgment on that matter.
As Mr. Snortridge proceeded with his
illustrations Mr. Hinkle withdrew his
objections. The audience ajiain smiled
gentiv, and the talesman replied that be
thought a Judge would be justified in ap
pointing orreappointingas receiver a man
whom he considered trustworthy, but ol
course such appointments ought to be
within the bounds of propriety.
Another phase of the organization of
the jury was brougnt up by Mr. Short
ridgb's query to this import: "Do you
think there is a public necessity to uphold
Judge Uebbard. the prosecuting witness,
in relation to these things that are men
tioned in the indictment?"
When Mr. Hinkle offered an objection
Mr. Bhortridse turned to him and re
marked that he had noticed that counsel
for the State was in the habit of w.th
drawing objections after hearing the ar
gument. Possibly some time migbt be
saved by letting the court know what he
intended to do in this instance. Mr.
Hinkle laughed cheerily and promised to
stand by bis objection. After argument
the question was ruled out and notice of
exception was formally given.
All this seemed to tickle tne numerous
lawyers for the prosecution, including
Judge Rebbard himself, who joined In
the recognition of humor as developed in
the examination thus far, which seems
destined to cause this case to be laughed
out of court.
From time to time Mr. Shortridge ob
jected to references to the circular issued
by the People's Home Savings Bank de
positors. He insisted that the prosecu
tion-must rely on "the editorial squib"
about Judpe Hebbard. which he showed
was not in itself hbelous. He gave notice
that the attorneys for the prosecution
must expect to rely on the allegations in
tne indictment.
Bimilar action was taken when the name
of Joseph Nash was called without re-
Bponse. Bench-warrants for theÂ»e gentle
men were oidered issued, but the court
declined to suspend operation* until their
attendance could be secured. To this
ruling an exception was tak n, and when
Joseph Huuser was called into the box
Mr. Shortridire formally objected, but the
court ordered the trial to proceed.
it was durinz the examination of Mr.
Hauser as to his qualiticntions to serve as
a juror that spirit of jollity appeared to
Kain control of the attorneys for the pros
t-cution. After asking if Mr. Hauser knew
Attorney \V. T. Jia-KCtt, who has been
trying the Haled: N'orcroÂ«s case for several
years, Mr. sboriridge inquired into the
gentleman's acquaintance with Dr. R. H.
McDonald and if he had ever been preju
diced against that financier by drinking
his vinegar bitters or otherwise. On re
ceiving a negative answer inquiry turned
to the matter of his acquaintance with
James A!va Watt, John A. Dunt, Gen
eral John F. tiheehan, General W. H.
H. Hart, General S. W. Backus or
any of tue other general! in the case.
Pursuing this line Mr. Shortridge wanted
to know if Mr. Hauler knew Colonel
Stone or Colonel Kahn, otherwise called
Congressman Kahn.
Here Mr. Knhn'- levity burst all bounds
nn l witti boisterous cachina'lons he inter
jected the exclamation: "Do you know
Senator Samuel M. Shortridge?" and for
a short time there was no much laughter
in the room that I'.ailiff Flynn wad com
pelled to us* his gavel vigorously in order
10 restore order.
This was manifestly another step in the
direction of laughing the case out oi
court, and as lawyers hobnobbed together
and complimented one another over the
cleverness of their respective sorties it
was apparent tnat any serious intent or
expectation of Miccesslully pressing the
charge was rapidly disappearing trom the
minds of the lawyers for the prosecution
if, in fact, any such expectation ever ex
isted.
Many times during the day the replies of
jurors indicated that they retarded the
criticism of Judge Hebbard as published
in the News Letter nothing more nor less
than the usual badinage indulged In by
partisans during political compai^ns.
The juiors now in the box are as fol
lows: Thomas G. Taylor, Charles Kane,
Adam Waener, John C. Anderson, A. M.
Lawven, K. Gambitz, K. B. Hansen, D.
Farquhason. Simon Cohen, R. Kayser D
B. Collins, William Deeney.
None of these hava been finally accept
ed, however, but are subject to challenges
by the attorneys on both sides. It is ex
pected that the jury will be completed
to-day.

hundred people were assembled with
Fathers Yorke. Mulligan, o'Snea, Kirby,
D. A. Ryan and J. J. O'Toole on tbe plat
form. Atter the frst number on the pro
gramme a piano solo by Mrs. Charles
Gagus. woich received the full measur* of
applau-e, Father Kirby in a few graceful
remarks presented Rev. Father Yorke,
who epoke in a humorous strain substan
tially as follows:
Ladles and Gentlemen: It is like carrying
coals to Newcastle to announce the openingof
this fair. You seem to have taken that into
Tour own hands. But it becomes necessary,
in order to make tbe affair a success, that
pocket* must be opened as well, and, as my
triend, Father Mulligan, remarks, pockets
with something in them. By toe way, permit
me to call your attention to the fact that that
gentleman came here this evening with his
well filled.
There are lomo people who consider a
church fair a very irreligious undertaking,
and that any tning in tne nature of buyiug and
telling is entirely out ol place in connection
with the service of God. Let me teil you a
story. Two sailors were shipwrecked and one
of them thought it a good time to pray.
"Bill," cays he to his companion, "can you
pray ?" "No," replied he; "why don't you
try it yourself, Jitck ?" "1 can't," says Jack;
"but we can take up a collection." We agree
with Jack that the most important thing
after prayer in a religious service is the col
lection. This occasion verifies that assertioa.
Let everybody try to do something.
There are tea stalls, or booths, at the
bazaar, very attractively decorated. All

-lection of ornaments, paintings, line

Three years ago, to accommodate the
residents of the western end of Sacred
Heart parish, a building, scarcely more
than a chapel, was deiicnted on April 15,
1894, to St. Aiines by Most Rev. Bishop
Montgomery. For a year it was a branch
of the Sacred Heart parish, and was at
tended by the priests from that church.
It was finally raised to the dignity of a
parish, and Father Kirby appointed the
pastor. During the past year he has had
the building enlargea to double its seating
capacity and ruaUe into a modern editice
of worsnip.
Accordingly it now labor? under the
large debt of $14,000, and the fair is in
tended to raise the amount in part. With
Father Kir In- at the helm, the clear waters
of finance are already in sight, and it can
not be long till the ladies have the proud
satisfaction of knowing that they con
tributed to that desirable end in no small
part.

A New York man who has just returned

phases makes the drinker feel as if he
were being transported over paradise m a

filling for the ioug-fclt want.
GREEKS AND TURKS.
The statements made by Chehk Bey, Turkish Consul-General in New York, and
the (irpck Consul-General in the same city in interviews published in Thi Call yes
terday give in a short space toe views of the situation from thÂ« standpoints ol botu
nations in a manner sufficiently clear to make known the forces upon which each
side relies for success in the struggle.
The Turk fpoke scornfully of the war and said: v
It is nothingâ mere child's play. Little Greece, two, three millions; Turkey, thlrty-fivo
milllom. It may be two days, two weeks,,two months. We will win. The Turks are great
fighters. The Koran tolls us that those who die in battle go straight to paradUe. Tney lieht
hard. You have here but one California; Turkey has a dozen. Vie get grain from Asia Minor
and oxport it to England, France and Italy. We want no American grain.
The Greek was not scornful of the power of Turkey. None the less he spoko
confidently of the success of his nation, saying:
I regard the capture of Prevezd as most Important. We will hold the key to Epirus. From
Prevcza and Arta is a coo 1 highway leading to Janina, the capital of Epirus, and the advance
upm that town will bring about a general uprising of the inhabitants, who are Greeks, and
may end in outflanking the Turkish troops.
It will be seen from these statements that the Turk counts upon maintaining in
tact the integrity of his country, holding undiminisheu all the forces of the empire,
and expects to be able to throw the whole military power of all its great population
against Greece so as to overrun that country in a comparatively short time. The
Greek, on the other hand, counts upon an uprising of the subject-peoples of European
Turkey, and expects to rlid on the soil of Turkey itself large numbers of warriors
who will esj ouse the cause of the cross against the crescent and enabU Greece to de
feat the foe which seems bo much stronger than herself.
Which of these views is correct it is impossible at this time to foretell. It
ha? lonp been known that all the peoples under Turkish rule in Europe are desirous
of throwing off the yoke and establishing themselves as separate nationalities. They
have in the paÂ«=t so far succeeded in doing so as 10 gain for Bulgaria and Servia an
existence as independent states. It is probable therefore that a large number of
people in Macedonia, Epiru-, Albania and other parts of Turkey will take advantage
of any success which the Greeks may gain to rise and join them in a common war
acainst the Turk.
The very fact, however, that thi? danger is foreseen and is counted on by the
Greeks tend* to prevent the possibility of its becoming a serious menace. The Turks
are or. euard against if, and so aiso is Russia and Austria. In fact, the situation is
so well understood the opinion prevails in Europe that Turkish success is necessary
to avoid the complications of other nations in the war. If the Greeks should win,
and the Balkan states should rise, Russia is sure to intervene, and that would compel
Austria an I England at any rate, and possibly other nations as well, to take part in
the contest.
The condition of the struggle is therefore one of absolute uncertainty. War has
broken out in a portion of Europe where the spirit of battle is easily aroused and
where there are comparatively few forces that tend to peace. To tfao half-savaee
tribes of the Balkan peninsula the cost of war and the lon of peaceful trade and com
merce will count for little when their race antagonisms and passions are aroused. It
is for that reason that many persons who sympathize with Greece hesitate to aid her
for fear of the result which will b9 sure to follow the success of her arms. In the
meantime England is strengthening her fleet in :he Mediterranean and Russia is aug
mentine her army along the borders of Turkey in Asia Minor. Each of these great
rivals desires peace, but neither trusts the other, and both are prepared for immediate
nc ion as soon as it becomes neepsÂ«arv.
GENEROUS GIVING.
The action of the Produce Exchange in
raising a large sum of money for the con
struc;ion of Balboa avenue and the con- |
tinued employment of labor gives another
proof of the public spirit of the men who
constitute its m< ml ership. Tne contri
butions to .he fund were large and were j
made with a promptness which manifests j
a true liberality ana a genuine c;vic j
patriotism.
It seems that nothing more was required
in the Exchange to produce these liberal
subscriptions than that the president,
Mr. Albert Gerberding, should call the at- j
tention of the members to the importance |
of the work and the need of immediate
additions to the fund. No sooner had he
completed his shorfspeech than the mem
bers of the Exchange Tied with one
another in seeing who should be the first
to contribute. Within a comparatively
short time the sum of JGi-j was raised, and
it was made known that this would be in
creased to at least $1000. This is a most j
excellent showing for the Produce Ex- !
change and the public will not fail to ap- j
precinte it at its true value.
It is now evident that the people of Fan I
Franc sco do not intend to let thi9 work ;
lag for lack of money. Tne contributions i
heretofore have bien liberal, and we have
not yet seen the end of them. Public in- I
terest in the enterprise, so far from drag
ging, seems to increase with < ach succes- Â«
sive need of more money. As rapidly as
the fund is diminished by the payment of j
wages so rapidly is it filled again by con
tributions from liberal and progressive
citizens.
Hitherto these contributions have come
mainly lrom what may be called the un
organiz d mass of the people. Now, how- ;
ever, a<* will be seen from the action of the
Produce Exchange, the associations and
organizations of the City have begun to
take an interest in the work and to act
together for bringing it to a successful com
pletion. This is a good sign of the *enti
ment of the City. It ia a reassurance that
all the money required will be raised in
time, bo that the work can be carried on
without a day of delay until the task has
been fully completed and Balboa avenue
has taken its place among the established
thoroughfares of the City, become one of
those driveways which add go much to
the attractiveness of San Francisco as a
place of residence and do so much to in
crease its prestige among the cities of the
Union. Â -, .'
THE 00A8T ROAD.
The probability that within a compara
tively short time the Southern Pacific
Company will decide whether or not to
Dush me work of closing the pap on the
coast road to a speedy completion will
recall to the public mind the importance
of this enterprise to San Francitco, Los
Angeies and the coast counties, and indi
rectly to the Stato at large. The closing
of the gap has long been desired and if it
can be accomplished this year it will
greatly stimulate the revival of industry,
which now seems to be everywhere well
assured.
The greater portion of the benefit of the
closing of the cap will undoubtedly be
reaped by t: c coast counties, wiiicli now
lie off the general highway of travel. To
them the completion of the road will
mean the virtual beginning of a new
epoch of development. Their lands will
be brought into market and capital will
have opportunities for the profitable ex
ploitation of their innumerable resources.
With these advantages will come an
increase of wealth and population, result
ing in a larger trade and traffic with both
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The counties along the coast are natu
rally among the richest and best in the
State. Their growth has been retar-ied
solely by lack of railroad communication
direct with the great centers of business
and industry. The mass of Travel between
Southern and Northern California has
turned aside from them and gone through
the valley of the San Joaqnin. Thus the
natural advantages of the coast counties
have been bidden from most of the
tourists and home-seekers in California,
with the consequence that t:.ey have been
pasbed by while other counties were build
ing up.
All that will be changed if the Southern
Pacific Company sees its way clear to com
plete the gap at once. The coast counties
will be opened ui> at tho beginninc of Uie
new era of reviving prospeiity and will be
sure to reap many benefits in the near
future.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 1897.
WATCHING THE TARIFF.
The action taken by Mnjor McLaughlin,
chairman of the Republican State Com
mittee, and Mr. John D. Spreckp.'s, repre
sentative of California in the National
Committee, in urging upon Senators Mor
rill and Allison the importance of main
taining a thoroughly prottcive duly on
imported fruit was most timely. It is
clear that an attempt will be made in the
Senate to reduce the rales of the Dingley
tariff on many articles of import, and un
iess the people of California are watchful
many of the industries of the State will be
made to suffer.
All reports from Washington show that
the importers, free- traders and so-called
revenue tariff men are making a fight
against the Dingley tariff all alone tne
line. They are endeavoring to bring about
a reduction of almost ail the duties adopted
by the House and, in particular, are mak
ing their attack against those interests
wh ; ch are peculiar to the West.
Among the interests assailed by the im
porters is that of fruit-growing. A hard
right was bepnn against the schedules
adopted by the House on imported fruits
as soon as they were announced. That
fight has been going on ever since, and so
strong is the pressure brought to bear up
on the Senate in the interests of fruit im
porters that our delegation in Congress
will need all the support lhat can be
given it at home to maintain tho cause
against its assailants.
In his telegram to Senator Morrill,
Major McLaughlin said: "Tne business
interests of this State imperatively de
mand no reduction from the House
schedule on raisins, Zante currants and
citrus fruits. The latter requires 1 cent
per pound protection." Mr. Bpreckels
telegraphed in similar terrai to Senator
Allison, saying: "I believe you will make
â¢ mistake in attempting to return citrus
fruits to a measurement basis. The In
dustry here is much depressed and the
request for 1 cent per pound duty will not
rut our growers on an equality with for
eigners."
The accuracy of these slatements can
not be questioned any more than the
urgent importance of making them at
this time. European fruit-growers have
cheap ocean transportation for their goods
to New York, while those grown in Cali
fornia have the heavy handicap of high
railroad rates. The duty asked for hardly
makes up the difference in the cost of
t ran;portatioM, and the justice of the de
mand is therefore apparent.
It should not be left to a few men to
make this fight for California interests.
The whole State, as far as possible, should
declare itself on the subject and strengthen
the hands of our representatives in Con
gress in upholding this important indus
try.

The thanks of along-suffering public are due the San Francisco Call. Instead of burden
in* its colums with yaids of rot about Durrant. two or three inches of space only are devoted
to him. Darrant is in his cell, no one but the keepers can see him, yet imaginative reporters
grind out columns of stuff about his alleged actions, when they cannot by any possibility have
any personal knowledge of them, nor indeed any knowledge by hearsay, for the prison officials
nre not gossips. The Call gives exactly the news, and no more, and is aoine exactly the right
thing aud no more.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS
Captain Holmes, who arrived here on Mon
day in command of the American ship Char
mer, is the oldest captain in active service in
the American merchant marine, and probably
the latest toasiume the bonds of matrimony.
Captain Holme* is 78 years of age, and began
going to Kea sixty-one years ago, when ho was
a lad of 17. He sailed first in the ship Apra
lachicola. commanded by a relative, and one
of his most notable voyages since that time
was In the ship Seminole. which be brought
out from New York many years ago in ninety
six days, beating the records of alt the fast
clippers of those days.
There is quite a romantic story connected
wi!h Captain Holmes' marriage. About fifteen
years ago, while he was living at Mystic,
Conn., a poorly clad, sickly little girl came to
his door begsing for shelter, and his wife took
the waii in and Drought her up. Ten years

ago Mrs. Holmes died, and the child, then
about 12 years of age, was left In the charge of
Mrs. Sarah Palmer of Mystic, who established
herself in the capiain's home as guardian of
thegir!. The chill died some years ago, but
whenever he came home from sea Captain
Ho.mes found everythiug so brieht and cheer
ful that he hated to leave, and finally con
cluded that life's journey with the woman
who had been so kind to his ward would be
preferable to the loneliness of a widower's
existence.
Mrs. I'nhner was willing, and the marriage
took pUce in November last, just before the
Charmer sailed for San Francisco, llrs.
Holmes is 59, but is still a bright ana charm

bride.

LAWYERS MAY WEEP.
I A Learned Judge Rules That Shfpmng Tears
Before a Jury Js a dm:.-.-: isle.
In a recent number of the Southwestern
Reporter Is printed the decision of Judge
â  Wilkesof the Supreme Court of Tennessee in
J r a case in which, among other things, it was
held that tne^ jury had been unduly inllu
enced by the" tears of counsel in argument.
Judge Wi.kes says: It is next as
signed as error that counsel for plain
tiff, in his closing argument, in the midst
of a very eloquent and impassioned appeal to
the Jury, s>hed tears and unduly excitfd the
sympathies of the juiy in favor of the plain
tiff, and greatly prejudiced them against de-
femlant. Bearing unon this assignment of
error we have been cited to no authority, and
after diligent search we have been able to find
none ourselves. The cor.c'uct of counsel in
pre<entinif their cases to juries is a mat'sr
which must bo left largely to ;he ethics of the
profession and the discretion of the trial
Judge. I'erhaps no two counsel observe ike
same rules in presenting their case* to tne
jury. Pome deal wholiy In lopiiâ argument
witnout embellishments of nnv kind. Others
use rhetoric and occasional flights of fancy
and imK^lnation. Others employ only noise
and gesticulation, reiving upon their earnest
ness and vehemence instead of logic and
rhetoric. Others appeal to the sympathiesâ it
may be the passions an 1 peculiaritiesâ ot the
jurors. Others combine all thoe wiih varia
tions and accompaniments of different kinds.
No cast-iron rule can or anould be laid down.
Tears have always been considered legitimate
arguments before a jury, a> d. while the ques
â¢ion has never arisen out of any such behavior
in this court, we know of no nile or jurisdic
tion in the court below to check them. It
would appear to be one of the natural rights
ot counsel which no court or constitution
could take away. Ii is certainly, if no more,
a matter of the highest personal privilege. In
deed, tf counsel has them at command It may
bo serlousiv questioned whether it is not hi&
professional auty to shed them whenever
proper occasion arisen, and the trial Judge
would not feel constrained to interfere unless
they were indulged In to such excess as to Im
pede or delay the business of the court. Tnia
must be left largely to the discretion of the
trial Judge, who has all the counsel and par
ties before him, and can see their demeanor
as well as the demeanor of the jury. In this
case the trial Judge was not asked to check
the tears, ami it was, we think, an eminently
proper occasion for their use, and we cannot
reverse for this.

Necessity.
Need of E'kins' Bill for tbs American
Merchant M trineâ Delay in
China Mails.
The regular quarterly meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce was ne;d yester
day afternoon. All matters to come be
fore the meeting had been prearranged
and memorials to Congress were drafted
and carried through with the regularity
of clockwork.
First to be brought before the meeting
was the question of a rebate on tinplates
used in canning. Julian Sonntar, the
chairman of tne tariff committee ap
pointed by the recent taiiff conference,
stated that the matter had been drawn to
his attention by several communications,
the nature and purport of which he pro
ceeded to re7eal. The resu t was thR
adop'ionof the following memorial to
Congress by unanimous vote:
To the Honorable Scnnte of the United Statusâ
Gentlemen: The Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco respectiuliy urges udoii your
honorable body the continued permission in
the proposed tariff bill of a drawback on tiu
plate imported and used in the export can
ning trade. It is a concession to the great
and growing canning industry oi the Pacific
Coast which will not work injury to the
Amerlcau tin manufacturer. If defied the
benefit of a drawback thereon it will tend to
destroy our salmon-canning Industry, as our
competitors therein in British Columbia use
the imported tin free ol duty ana can thus
under ell us. Our fruh-car.ning industiy needs
this concession avid if granted it will, with in
creased output, draw more heavily on Ameri
can plate in addition. The amount of the
duty thus remitted is of little consequence to
the American manufacturers, while at present
of vital n.oment to us. For thene reasons we
pray the honorable Senate to pram us this
b>on, and with ussurauc-8 of our high respect
subscribe ourselves your obedient s-ervans,
The chamber of Commerce of San Kkascibco.

THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF SaN FItASCIPCO.
A memorial was aUo drafted and will
be sent to Congress petitioning the enac
tion of the proposed bill introduced into
tne Senate by Senator Elkins for the re
habilitation of the American commercial
marine in the foreign trade. Reference
was ninde to its glorious pnst and its
icnobie present condit.on, and it was em
phatically asserted that the passage of
such a bill won d give an impetus to do
mestic manufacturing interests and thus
in a great measure aid in the return of
prosperity to the country.
Another memorial lo the Senate, one
which means a great deal to the farming
interests of this coast, was with regard to
the question of a rebate on grain bags,
and created a deal of favorable discussion.
It was adopted unanimously and was iv re
ality tbe most important* action at the
session. The memorial reads in fuil as
follows:
To the Honorable Senate of the Vnited Stalesâ
Gentlemen: The agricultural interests ot the
Pacific Coast have suffered from the severe de
pression oi the past four years equally with
other portions of our common country and i.i
one respect have borne a burden from which
other sections have been exempt. Wo allude
to the use of sacks In shipping cereal products
for export, amounting to about 80 cen a per
ton, including extra labor. Were the Nicara-
Cua canal completed this item would haye 1
taved our farmers about $640,000 in the
past year. an<l with prospects ol an expert sur
plus lor 1897 of 1.000.000 tons about $800.
--000. It is the desire of this Chamber oi Com
iuerc9 to aid the Pacific Coast wheat-grower
from a part of this exceptional burden, and to
this end we respectfully urge upon your hon
orable Dcdy that a rebate equal to the fuil
amount oi the duly be allowed on all sacxs
used for the export of wheat and bar.ey.
Eveu then the Pacific Coast wheat-grovror will
be ata disadvantage wiih Eastern competi ors
owing to Increased distance, cont and lime in
reaching European markets, which can only
be eliminated when ashort cheap water route
toconÂ«umiug markets can be reached through
the canal. Confident that the United States
Senate will favorably consider what appears
to us as a fair and reasonable request we have
the honor to subs-crib- ourselves, with great
resp3et, your fellow-citizens,
The Chamber of Commerce of San* Francisco
It was resÂ»lv*>d that the standing com
mittee on foreign commerce and revenue
laws be requested to call the attention of
San Francisco merchants to the adyisi
bility of Increasing their commerce wiitj

Southern Africa, and request their co
operation in an effort to reach these mar
nets, both of which were represented to
be full of promise.

There WÂ«re No Startling Develop.
ments in the Second Day's
Proceedings.
There was little of spice and sensation
to enliven the second day's proceedings
in the trial which is to determine the va
lidity of the deeds which Mrs. Nettie
Craven hol'is for some of the valuable
real estate claimed by the children of the
late Senator James G. Fair.
The lawyer* are still devoting their
energies toward securing a jury, and this
is seldom other than a tedious and unin
teresting process, no matter what the
case.
But there was the same dense crowd in
Judge Slack's courtroom, and a hundred
or more pairs ol" ears drank in eagerly
| every word that was uttered by the tales
men and the attorneys. Mrs. Craven and
| her daughter spent the entire forenoon fn
court, but only a portion of the afternoon.
I Ail of the lawyers who attended the
openinc of the ea?e Monday were on hand
again when order was called for ypsterday
morning, with the exception of Mr. Pier
son, but then he was only a little laic, and
his associate, Mr. McEnerney, only had
the pleasure of quizzing the talesmen for
a few short minutes.
George W. Elder was the first one of the
summoned citizens taken in hand. The
information imparted by him that most
interested Mr. McEnernev and called for
the m >st questioning was the fact that
Mr Klder's two children attended the
Mission Grammar School, over which
Mrs. Craven nas so lone presided as its
principal. But the talesman assured the
attorney that he did not know ti>Â« lady
herself, and the fact that hit offspring
were being educated under her direction
would n no way influence his judgment
should he happen to be selected as a
juror.
The gentleman g^ jj c Da( j not k^pt
himself uosted on the ranuii atioi:s of tue
f"air case generally, and was in no way
interested in the outcome. In fact Mr.
Elder could conceive of no reason why he
should not make a satisfactory juror, as
be had no opinions as to the merits of any
of the issues, had expressed none and
could be entirely impartial. There was
nothing lett for the attorneys to <io then
but to assign Mr. Elder to the list of
â¢'t^miorarily passed."
James H. Kavanaugh is an ex-member
of the police fore- , who is drawing a pen
sion. He did not know enoug about the
prospective evidence in the case, he said,
in answer to ttie questions put 10 him, to
disqualify him in this resnect as a juror â
thai is, he had had no opportunity to draw
any conclusions. He had not read much
about the case and was satisfied nc could
listen to the evidence without prejudice.
Mr. Kavanaugh said he was well acquaint
ed with Chief of Police Lees, but their
relations had never been more than of
purely a. busin;ss nature. He was passed,
Attorney Pierson put in an appearance
at this point and re'i-ved Mr. McEnerpey
of the task of questioning ihe talesmen
on behalf of the plaintilK He began
with W. J. Golchpr of tne tirm of Ciay
brough, Golcher & Co. It was soon ap
parent that Mr. Golcher would not til! the
bill as a juror, owing to the rixed opinion
that he held regarding the disputed issues
of the case. He was challenged and in
structed by the court to retire.
A. J. Buneman, a wholesale liqnor
dealer, also confessed to having an opin
ion, and said he had in addition discussed
the cas<? freely. His ideas were doubtless
well known and he hardly thought he
would make a fair juror. He was in con
sequence told to go Home.
bamuel Kalisky was another who hart
an opinion, but be said it was probably
not so strong but thnt it might be re
moved by evidence. Mr. Foote, for the
defense, did not care about keeping Mr.
Kali'ky on the panel, but the other side
made a tight to retain him.
Judge Slack then nskfd the talesman
ju>t one question, which settled the mat
ter.
'â¢In case of & doubt, Mr. Kalisky, would
you permit your previously formed opin
ion to sway you in reaching a conclu
sion ?"
"I would," replied the gentleman, and
he was promptly retired.
Cnarles Q. Pope s*id he knew none of
the interested parties in the litigation and
was familiar with little or nothing about
the issues involved as ' he bad not read
much about the case. Mr. Pope admitted
there was no reason so far as he could di
vine why he should not make a satis:ac
tory juror, so he was for the time being
passed.
Ferdinand Stanle proved to bÂ« one of
those gentlemen who bad formed a fixed
opinion and was retired on a challenge.
Likewise William John, a cigar-dealer,
who acknowledged. that he would not be
willing to be triad by a jury if it wÂ»s made
up of men in such a fram# of .mind as he.
Albert Dernham and F. .William Riechers
were rejected for expressing similar con
victions, and so was Cyrus L. Gates.
George A. Cloueh wouldn't do .because
he was no', on the assessment roll, and
Robert E. Darbee fell because he had
iormed an opinion.
At this point Judge Slack ordered the
usual noon rer*>ss.V
Milton .H. , Cook, , a manufacturer of
leather belting/was taken in hand by the
attorneys at the opening of the afternoon
session. The only persons connected with
the case with whom he was acquainted
were Attorney Reuben H. Lloyd and
Notary Lee g D Craig. Trie-latter, bad
transacted some business for him and Mr.
Lloyd . was ; the attorney I for the â¢ Cook
estate. /The i, gentleman T had a ; positive
opinion, however,- and Mr. Foote'a chal
lenge was allowed. Â . , . "^''
Alfred li. Greenebanm confessed to own

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 189 T.
People Seen at tfu Second Day's Session of the Great Faif Case*
Mr. Mvjiehan was the twelfth juror
temporarily passed and the box was now
tilled. Judge Slack announced that a per
emptory challenge from the plaintiff's
side was at this time in order.
"On behalf of the plaintiffs we will ex
cuse Jared C. Hoae," sr.id Mr. Pierson.
Mr. llii.ii; was about to trip joyfully on
his way when Mr. Foote arose and hailed
him with the remark that he was not yet
free. Turning to the court Mr. Fooie said
he would ask at this stu^e of the proceed
ing a ruling as to the number of peremp
tory challenges the plaintiffs were to be
allowed. Different issues were joined.* he
said, in bringing this action against Mrs.
Craven and he argued that they were en-,
titled to but a single set of statutory per
eraptories. He would oppose the chal
lenge of Mr. Hoag, he said, if the other
side attempted to divide these i sues and
thus secure the advantage of separate and
additional seta-of peremptory .privileges.
Charles S. Wheeler, who appears in the
case representing Mies Virginia Fair in
intervention, arose and said that the i'sr.e
he was pleading for was wholly separate
and distinct from that of the plaintiffs
proper, and for that reason he claimed an
additional privilege of peremptorily chal
lenging jurors.
'â¢Not at all," replied Judge Slack.
"Your intere ts here in intervention are
in common with those of the other plain
tiffs. The issues to be passed upon by the
jury are one and the same. You will be
required to unite on the challenges."
'We aÂ«tc that an exception be . noted to
the court's ruling," said Mr. Wheeler.
"It is understood, then,!' said Mr. Del
mas, addressing the court, "thai their
right to challenge. is denied until they
shall unite?"
"Yes," replied Judge Slack. :
Messrs. Wheeler, and McEuerney
held a whispered conversation and then
surrendered. .They agreed to unite.
James Martinom, a paste manufacturer,
answered all of the necessary qualifica
tions as to non-acquaintance with the
lawyers cr litigants. Neither of the ques
tioning attorneys troubled themselves.
however, to ask Mr. Munition! if he had
been reading about the case or hud an
opinion, and both passed . him. This was
a surprise to Martinoni as well as to oth-
I ers in the courtroom, and seemed to be
particularly disappointing to the former
as well. lie arose, and, addressing the
court, said he would like to so, es he
feared that from rending the papers he
had formed an opinion. '
"Well, maybe they want you anyhow,"
replied Judge Slack, pleasantly. "I guess
you will have to stay awhile."
- Another peremptory challenge, this
time on the part of the defendant, was
now in order.
"We excuse Louis J. O'Farrell," said
Mr. Del mas.
Joseph Ezzolo was not familiar enough
with the English language to suit either
side and was excused by consent.
Harry Adler, who conducts the billiard
hall at 8 Eddy street, satistie I everybody
because he was not on intimate terms
with any one concerned and besides was
in no way biased or prejudiced. He was
Dashed and the box was Main filed.
"We challenge George W. Elder," said
Mr. Pierson, but," he added, "we are not
united on this challenge."
"Then it doesn't go," promptly asserted
Attorney Foote.
"You will have to unite, gentlemen, be
fore I will allow you that challenge," said
| Judge Slack, addressing the attorneys for
I the plaintiffs.
Messrs. Pierson, Wheeler and McEner
ney conferred again and then Mr. Pierson
announced that they had united, so Mr.
Elder was directed to leave the box. ;
George H. Buckingham wa* subjected
to quite a lengthy examination at the
bands of Mr. Foote because he admitted
that he h*a formed an. opinion regarding
the case that it would take evidence to
eradicate from bis mind. Still, Mr. Buck
ingham said he was not prejudiced.
"Could you in your frame of. mind give
both sides a fair and impartial trial?'
asked Mr. Foot?.
"I think so," replied Mr. Buckingham,
hesitatingly.
"Well, would yon?"
"I only think so."
Mr. Fbote challenged the gentleman,
but the court, after questioning him, de
nied the challenge. A peremptory chal
lenge from the defense was due at this
juncture, however,' and Mr. Foote
promptly applied it to Mr. Buckingham.
William F. Schulz and Abraham Brown
were Doth successfully challenged by Mr.
Foote . because . they entertained fixed
opinions, and Rein hard tUfen went out
because of acknowledged and bitter preju
dice, and so did Frederick W. Zeile.
I Louis Markus, who deals in gentlemen's
furnishing goods at 401 Kearny street, an
swered all of the requirements of the at
torneys on both sides, as he bad no preju
dice and had nor even talked about the
case. Consequently he was passed.
At this juncture Mr. Pierson called the
attention of the court to the fact that
Juror James H. Kavanaugn, who was
passed yesterday, was a pensioned police
officer. Under the law, he said, this gen
tleman was still legally a public officer, as
he was subject to the call of the Chief of
Police for duty in cases of exigency. Ac
cordingly Mr. Kavanaugh whs disqualified
from sitting on the jury. . Mr. Foote read
ily consented to the dismissal of Kava
naugD, so no challenge was necessary."; \*
Walter â¢ B. Webster acknowledged hav
iug a strong impression, but was not pre
judiced. It developed after a 'rather
lengthy cross-examination mat he conid
not sit impartially on the jury and the
court allowed Mr. Foote's challenge.
' Christian Jansen Clemens, a livery
stable keeper, had an opinion and was
sent away on a challenge. Joseph Bautu
garten and F. H. Venter, for similar rea
sons, were dropped from the panel.
Charles S. Bennett, a carpenter who
was formerly employed in the School De
partment, but who is not working now.
filled the bill and was accepted by the de
fense. The attorneys for the plaintiffs,
however, exercised one of their peremp
tory challenges on Mr. Bennett and be
was excus-Kt. :â¢ ; .-" : . ; . \
J F. D. McCann, who is connected with
the house ol Man, Sadler & Co., and L. B.
Doe, a mining man, were excused because
they were burdened with fixed opinions.
', Charles D. Douglas, an ex-Custom-house
inspector and a veteran of the Civil War,
bad no opinion whatever and therefore no
prejudice. He was not intimately ac- 1
quainted with any one interested in the
Intention and felt quite sure that he could
act impartially. So be was passed.
Jame* Patterson Jr. was called into the
box and sworn, but Judge Slack adjourned
court for the day before his examination

THE CHARMER

Made One of the Quickest
Voyages of the
Season.
Captain Holmes Received an

News From the Sealers Ij Encourag*
ingâ Tho Lnisa D Has 1000
Skins.
The American nhip Charmer arrived
from New York yesterday in the smartest
time of the season, bar one. She made
tht run in 134 days, but Captain
Holmes considers it the poorest showing
he has ever made. For ten days he was
off the Golden Gate and three times ran
up the coast in a vain search for a north
westerly slant to carry hiss ship into port-
When the wind finally did favor him the
stuut ship covered the distance inside of
twenty-four hours.
On this occasion the Charmer comes
consigned to J. F. Chapman & Co., the op
position, while on the outward trip she
will be loaded by the combine.
Captain riolmesand Chief Officer Henry
Raw. ins were two familiar figures to old
timers in tho mercantile marine. They
were in the Seminole together for eleven
years, and all In all they served as master
and mate on the snme vessel for twenty
two years. Ha w !ins did not come in with
tbe CLarmer on this trip.
He fell down tLe hold while the vessel
was discharging at Yokohama, and was
only saved by a miracle, lie had just
co me on deck from his breakfast, and was
going into the lowt* r hold to relieve the
second mate. In the meantime the sail
ors had removed the lower hatch, and
when Kawlins, thinking it was there, went
to step on it he fell into apace.
The belief that the Samaria is lost 13
gradually growing into conviction. One
of the latest converts is 11. D. Chandler,
who owns the coal cari.'O. "She came out
from here with a cargo of coal last June,"
said he, "and was one of tho stouten shits
I have ever seen. She made a round trip
for me, and I was awaiting tier return in
order to charter her again. Sho was a
sister to the Columbia, now owned oy me,
but two years younger, and a lew months
ago made the trip to Seattle and back in
twenty-nine duyÂ». She was not over
loaded, but I am afraid sho bits gone
nevertheless."
Nine vessel?, one after the other, have
arrived at Pupet Sound, reporting wreck

coast. None of the lumber boati from the
Sound are overdue, so if any of the fleet

In the practical determination of tho pro

A DAUGEROUS OLD SWITCH.
Many Vehicles TV rf eked on Howard
and Second Streets.
The custom of the several street rail
roads of leaving unused tracks and
switches in various parts of the City is
causing great damage to the public that
travels In vehicles. Everyday complaints
are made of broken wheels ana the gen
eral wreckage o| wagons of all kinds, I lie
last accident occurred yesterday morning
on the corner of Second and Howard
streets.
At that point is a small piece of an old
switch which has not been used since the
Howard-street road was converted Into a
cable line. One end of the rail is several
inches above the surface of the cobbles,
and it is a perfect trap for catching the
tires of wagou wheels.
Yesterday morning a wapon belonging
to the Prosit bakery at 318 TnirJ street,
whiie passing down the street caught the
tire under the rail and stopped the wagon
so suddenly that, aside from breaking the
wheel and the pole, it threw the drivt>r
ana two large baskets lull of bread out be
tween the two horses. The animals ran
away, but were caught by Charles H. Tay
lor and two other men before they had
gone far. Mr. Taylor, who lives near by,
states that every week one or more vehi
ces are wrecked on injured by the old
switcu.

LOOKING FOR LAWLESS.
The Racetrack Tou Is Accused of Swin
dling a Woman.
Robert Lawless, a racetrack habitue,
who has mixed matters on former occa
sions with the Police Department, is again
being sought by the detectives.
This time he is accused by Mrs. Mary K.
Smith of 28 Ellin street with having swin
d ed her out of $150.
The lady is very fond of horses, and she
was pleased to accept the offer of Lawless
to sell her two thoroiigtiDreda â Volante,
and a two-year-old elding by Kylo out of
Lvriia Ferguson â lor the paltry sum of
$800. It was necessary, however, that
|l. .ii cash should be paid down to bind the
bargain.
The money waÂ« handed over to Lawless
on October 13, 1896, and since that time
he has not made any returns.
FRESNO VINEYARDS
IN GREAT DANGER
Vine - Hoppers Attacking
the Young and Tender
Canes.
The Large Numbers of the Litt'e
Pests Cause Serious
Alarm
Professor Hilgard Has Taken Action
Other Parts of ths State Sucu d
Take Warn nj.
The ravages of the vine-hopper, or
thrips, in the vineyards of Fresno County
is causing the VineyardtHts all over the
Stato to watch their growing harvest with
more care than usual.
This was the subjsct of much discussion
at the last meeting of the Fresno Farmers'
Club on Monday, anil reports were made
that the little pests threaten to destroy
the coming crop of grapes. They have
already come forth in such large numbers
that in places they have sapped the vitality
out of the vines. Ttieydo not attack the
structure of the vino, Out suck the juice
from the tender canes and leaves.
Those who have thus far suffered from
the nests nave tried all kinds of remedies
and means of destroyine the vine-hopper.
Some have applied sulphur and others
sprayed witn whale oil soap, but usually
with the result that the remedy killed the
tender vines as well as the pest. * The
vineyardists urged all to inspect their
vines with regard to the hopper and re
port at once; nlso as to the effects of such
remedies were used. Tbo club teleeraphed
to Professor Hilgard of the State Univers
ity for such advice as he could give.
Professor Hilpard, when interviewed on
the subject last night, said:
"All I know about the pest is that it is
raging in the vineyards of Fresno County,
and from the reports of the farmers and
vineyardists it is appearing earlier and
in greater numbers than any previous
year. I have been telegraphed to and
written to concerning a remedy for their
destruction, and in response to the call
made, Professor Wood worth, the ento
mologist, lei t ior Fresno County last
night. He will study the insect and its
habits and attempt to discover a remedy
with which lo destroy it. When he has
finished his investigation he will lecture
to the farmers on the result and recom
mend to them such remedies as are found
to be expedient."
THE SITUATION SERIOUS.
Professor Woodworth on the Results
of Hit Investigations
tRESNO, Cal., April 20.â Professor C.
W. Woodworm of the State University is
at present engaged in conducting experi
ments in vineyards near this city to devise
some means of destroying tue thrips or
vinetioppers, which have come out in
countless numbers this season and
threaten the raisin crop. It is now known
that the hoppers are "holdovers" from
last year's vintage, which have survived
the winter and are now as lively as ever
and . iceediiiÃly hungry. Vineyards that
were winter-plowed anu plowed deep are
the lrast infested by the hoppers.
The investigation wiil be pursued closely
by Prolessor >Vood worth, with a view of
ueiermimug the true character and habits
of the thrips and discovering a method
for thpir extermination. In an interview
with The Call correspondent, the profes
sor stated that the situation was more
serious than he had . xpected, the thrips
beinir more abundant this year than they
had ever been be/ore so early in the spring.
It was the first time, he said, that he had
known this insect to produce curl of the
young leavpf, and it reminded him some
what cf the Santa Clara hoppers. He be
lieved that if something was not done
within two weeks to stop the ravaces oi
the pest it would cause the buds to drop
and destroy the first crop of crapes.
EdwarJ Gibbon nsed a card catalogue
for his own library, and the British
Museum has purchased this unique reiic.
What is remarkable is that the great his
torian used the backs of playiug cards for
the purpose.

Schilling's Best tea sells well
in the country â grocers know
their customers. They talk
with them; are friends with
them; would rather sell them
good things at a fair profit than
poor things at a big profit.
In the city â you don't know
your grocer well â business is
pretty heartless. Even the
biggest grocer sells colored tea,
because he makes more profit
on it than on Schilling's Best.
About the same with Schil-

But you can get them if you

Further news of the suppression of the
rebellion in Raiatea by the French reached
here by the Darkentine City of Papeete
yesterday. The soldiers did not spare the
rebels and the slaughter was great at
times. The French loss was very light,
and when during the last fight of the war
the soldiers stormed a hastily constructed
barricade and put the garrison of 250 na
tives to death in a bayonet charge the
Queen of the island surrendered. She
and the high chiefs took the oath of
allegiance to France, but it did not do
much good, as they were all placed on a
gunboat and transported to New Cale
donia, the French penal settlement.
Over 300 of the other men who partici
pated in the war were put aboard a trans
port and taken to Christmas Isiand. When
they were lauded there it was discovered
that there was no water, so the natives
had to be taken aboard atain. and this
time they were taken to Nouka Hiva.
They were kept Vhere for some time and
were finally taken to an isiand ieased as a
cattle run by M. Litchle, an Alsatian.
A sufficient quantity of food to last them
so many days was given them, and then
the transport steamed away.
When the food gave out the natives be
gan slaughtering Litchle's cattle and
when he protested they threatened his
life. Then he started for Tahiti on the
City of Papeete and when the barkentine
left the capital of the French colony he
wns vigorously pushing a claim against
the French Government for his herd of
350 cattle, which he asserted was in danger
of being exterminated.
Among the passengers who came up in
the cabin of the City oi Papeete were Mrs.
6. J. Hutchinson ana A. Petersen. The
former is the mother ot A. H. Hutchinson,
editor of the Endeavorer, the official oruan
of the Youns Men's Christian Endeavor.
She came here from Los Angeles as a
missionary from the Holiness Church of
Southern Calilornia. Her destination was
Nouka Hiva and she took passage on the
barkentine Tropic Bird. When she
reached her destination the exiled natives
were there.
She admits having heard of the slaugh
ter of the rebels, but will not discuss the
matter. "I had little or no chance to see
anything," said she yesterday, "but the
end of the lighting was the subject of dis
cussion everywhere. When I applied for
permission to land and explained to the
authorities that 1 had traveled all the way
from California to preach the gospel of
holiness to the natives I was a^-ked the
question 'Are you a Catholic?' I answered
that I was not. Then there was a consul
tation, and I was informed that I could
not land on any oi the groups in the Mar
quesas. My instructions were to remain
in my own quarters and do no teaching.
When the City of Papeete arrived my bag
gage was put aboard and I was politely
told that 1 was not wanted. I might have
been allowed to labor in Tahiti, but that
ground is thoroughly covered, so 1 deter
mined to come back home. There is no
branch of the Holiness church in San
Francisco, so I will at once start for my
home in Southern California."
The crew of the trader were non-com
mittal, but B. Hermann, who came up in
the steerage, spoke freely about the war.
''The natives have made the most stub
born resistance ever encountered by the
French in the southern seas," said he.
"On two other occasions warships and
troops were sent to subdue the rebels, but
alter cha-ing the natives into the bush
had to retire in despair. On this occasion
It was a war of extermination. The
natives were driven into the bush and
then the troops were set to work cutting
rnaus around and across the islands.
Whenever the natives were cornered they
were shot down, and the last grand sortie
ended the unequal conflict.
"Tne natives had dug a trench and
thrown up a barricade of mud anu trunks
of trees. Behind this they made a des
perate stand. They held ihe trained sol
diers at bay as long as their ammunition
held out, but that was not for ionn. The
Frenchmen drew their lire time and again
and never made a return. Then in a
moment the French coiutun was formed,
and the order was fix bayonets, charge.
It was all over in a few minutes, and
there were not a dozen natives left to tell
the tale. They were caught in ttieir own
trap, and before they could make a sem
blance of defense it was all over. The
bodies were buried in the trench, and the
dozen survivors, out of a total of 300 war
riors, were marched away as prisoners of
war. The next day the Queen surren
dered, and then came the deportations.
"The natives have been constantly spok
en of as rebels. Now they were notuing of
tne sort. They had never been subdued,
bad never acknowledged the authority of
France until the French gained the last
decisive victory, and why they should be
called insurgents and so treated I cannot
tell. They were fighting for their hearths
and homes, and why the Queen and high
chiels should be sent into penal servitude
is a mystery."
When the barkentine sailed from Pa
peete everything was very quiet among
the islands. One of the men-of-war was
stationed at the conquered islands, an
other was on its way with the Queen and
her high chiefs to is ew Caledonia, whfie
the transport was seeking au island on
which to place the other exiles. Business
was very uuli, and all the City of Papeete
brought up was cocoanuts and a few bags
of coffee.

Session.

The twenty-seventh annnal session of
the Medical Society of California convened
at Golden Gate Hall yesterday morning
with a large attendance of delegates from
all parts of the State. Among those
prominent throughout the State were the
following:
Drs. William Watt Kerr, W. H. Mays, J. M.
Williamson, J. Henry Barbat, R. L. Rigdon,
G. J. Fiugibbon, Stanley Stillman and Georeo
B. Somers of San Francisco; T. W. Hunting
ton, Sacramento; W. W. Hitchcock, Los An
geles; D. D. Crowley, Oakland; M. M. Chip
man, San Diego; A. M. Gardner. Napa; C. W.
Jonei, Grass Valley; J. S. Sargent, Santa Rosa,
ana William J. G. Dawaon, St. Helena.
The following new applicants were
elected to active membership:
Philip Mills Jones, E. E. Kelly. John C.
Fisher, L. L. Darr, Sonoma County; Kate P.
Van Gorden, Alameda County; Campbell Ford
and Philip King Brown, San Francisco; G. W.
Dwindle. Siskiyou County; J. Ma her and J. J.
Medros, Al&meda County.
The following were elected honorary
members:
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles R. Greenleaf,
surgeon. United States army; Lieutenant-
Colonel J. V. I). Middleton, surgeon, United
States army.
The session was called to order by Dr.
Henry Gibbons, and an address of recep
tion was delivered by Dr. W. IT. Cheney,
chairman of the committee of arrange
ments.
In his annual address Dr. Gibbons said
that much had been achieved for science
during the year. The profession was
gradually attaining a higher standard,
and he confidently prophesied that the
time would soon come when California in
that respect would be inferior to that of
no State in the Union. Better classes of
students were being received every year,
superior in ability and education to those
who had entered the profession in past
years. Dr. Gibbons was of the opinion,
however, that the State did not take
enough interest in the profession. A
board of examiners should be established
to pass upon the qualifications of all
students.
Such a board would undoubtedly fix a
high standard of ability and by keeping
the profession up to that standard work
an improvement to the medical as well as
the lay world. In addition to State super
vision of medical practitioners Dr. Gib
bons would have the Federal Government
undertake the regulation of medicine and
medical men throughout the country. He
said a National Board of Health should
be established, with power to manage all
matters . regarding public health. Give
such a body authority to pass upon the
purity of foods, take charge of epidemics,
manage quarantine affairs in all seaports
and in general supervise the health boards
of the country. Such a body would be of
more benefit to the country than a Depart
ment of Agriculture.
Alter this address the following were
appointed a committee upon medical to
pography and meteorology: C. Max Ric:i
ter, San Francisco (chairman); C. \V. Nut
ting, .Etna Mills; H.H. Davis. Sonoma;
B. M. Gill, Dunsmuir, and C. "W. Evans,
Modesto. ...
During the afternoon there were a num
ber of interesting papers embraced in the
following programme:
"Observations on the Subject of Etiology and
Symptomatology of Dementia Paralyiica," by
A. W. Hoitsholi, Stock ton; "The Causation ana
Treatment of the Morphine Habit and the
Possibility of Its Cure," by J. W. Robertson,
Livermore; "Neurasthenia," by H. N. Rucker,
Oakland; "The Progress of Surgery During the
Last Decade," by Tnomas W. Huntlngton,
Sacramento; "The Radical Cure of Hernia,
with Cases," by William Le M yne Wills, Los
Angeles; "Serum Therapy in Surgery," by
George B. Somers, San Francisco; "Neuro
pathic Gangrene of the Skin." by Emmet Rix
ford, San Francisco; "Lamlnectomy Sixteen
Months After Injury, with Recovery â Exhibi
tion of Patient," by Oscar J. Mayer, San Fran
cisco.
Dr. Oscar J. Mayer's paper on "Laminec
tomy" was one of the most interesting
features of the session, because be had a
patient whose phenomenal recovery from
what the laity calls "a broken back" was
illustrated by the exhibition of the man
himself. â¢ â  ' â  â¢ . -
The man referred to is Edward Wuger,
formerly a storekeeper at the Pacitic Onion
Club. On April 23, 1894, he was crushed
by an elevator so that the second and third
lumbar vertebra? were fractured.
Wuger was given up for an incnrablo
and was s.'nt to the King's Daughters
Home for Incurables, where he lsy par
alyzed and bedridden for sixteen months,
when Dr. Mayer was called into the case.
With the assistance of Drs. Barbat, Car
penter, and Villain, on September 6, 1895,
the muscles and ligaments adjacent to the
spine were detached 'as far as the fifth
lumbar vertebra, and the arches of thÂ«
first and -second vert' bra; were removed,
drainage tubes being placed in the spine.'
In spite of theaelicacy and danger. of
the operation, which. the books pronounce
unusual, the man recovered and was ex
hibited before the society yesterday. When
tbo patient was stripped . a slight depres
sion in the back was discovered, but other
wise he appeared to be all right. He walks
all right but for a slight weakness in the
ankles, caused by the degeneration of some
of the nerve tissues adjacent to the spine.
The case wasoneof great interest by : rea
son of the small percentage of recoveries
in such operations. ... ;
The evening session was well attended
and the papers were very interesting. The
following constituted the evening's pro
gramme: ana
The application of electro-magnetism in the
tracing and removal of particles of steel or
iron from the interior ol the eye, with demon
stration of the sMeroscope. small magnet
(Hirschberg) and- large new magnet (Haab),
lollowed by experiment*, by A. Barkan, Eau
Francisco.
Demonstration of X-ray apparatus and its
uses in diagnosis, by -Philip Mills Jones, San
Francisco.
Demonstration of the Roentgen rays in car
diac diagnosis, by Albert Abrams. San Fran
cisco.
>. Dr. Barkan's lecture on the modern
methods of extracting foreign substances
from thÂ» eye was heard with great in
terest. He showed how the large magnet
removes steel and iron with ease and how
the small ones may be used with great ad
vantage in certain cases where the large
one is inapplicable.* He exhibited the
method by removing steel from hog's
eves and bad a patient present from
v.hose eye a steel chip had been removed.
The conclusion was that many eyes are
saved by modern . methods, whereas, un
der, the ; old treatment, nearly all were
lost. ;. - . Â»
The papers on the X ray were Heard
with great interest and ii was shown that
the ray is of great value in certain diag
noses.' â  â â â¢-.

Rev. Dr. Rader at the Bay Conference
Comm'.nds the Course of Dr.
Lyman Abbott.
The Bay Conference of Congregational
churches was held yesterday afternoon
and evening at the Park Congregational
Church, on Paga street, near Baker. Rev.
George Mooar was made moderator pro
tern, and called the meeting to order.
After devotional services the following
named officers were elected:
Moderator, Rev. J. K. McLean; scribe. Rev.
L.W.Condon; registrar, Itev. O. B. Hatch;
committee on credentials â Hey. W. W. Scud
der, Rev. J. H. Goodeli, Key. E. K. Williams,
Rev. \V. W. Chase and Key. E. D. Hale; com
mittee on missionsâ Rev. G. B. Hatch. Rev.
C. R. Brown, Rev. C. Sadler: business com
mitteeâRev. G. B. Hatch fex-officio), Rev. C. a
Nash and Rev. S. F. Bufford; committee on
lay preachers â Rev. J. K. Harrison, Rev.
George Mooar aud Rev. E. Ga.loway; nomi
nating committeeâ Professor Foster, Deacon
Grove of Plymouth and Rev. W. Frear.
Reminiscences of Dr. C. O. Brown
floated in the air like the summer mist
of eventide when the following was read:
It is proposed to amend article VII, section
2, of the constitution as follows: Striking out
"to inquire iuto the case aud to report to the
conference, which shall then proceed accord
ing to the Scriptural method aud extent," and
insertingâ -'And, after inquiring, to report to
the conference, which may ihen, at its discre
tion, take steps to secure m- calling of an
ecclesiastical council to consider the matter;
but this comerence shall never exercise legis
lative or judicial authority nor consent lv uct
asa council of reference."
A silence ensued, but before it became
too painful because of its intensity Dr.
Pond arose to a question of order. He
could not see how the conference could
pass the amendment constitutionally.
Without any di-cussion to speak of the
matter was postponed until the December
meeting.
Dr. Brown was tried by the Bay Confer
ence, and it appeared that the conference
regretted the disagreeable act and desired
not to be saddled with a repetition thereof.
Dr. Cruzan, representing the Congrega
tional paper, the Pacific, complained that
subscriptions were not as plentiful as they
should be and said the paper could not
exist unless the church stood back of it.
The reports of the different churches were
then given, showing a decided improve
ment in every way. In speaking of the
American Board of Foreign Missions Mr.
Adams said that more religion came buck
to us in this country than we ever sent
out. and a great deal of our trade to-day
was the result of foreign missions. Rev.
Dr. Scudder stated in a few brief words
that the society was $47,C00 behind last
year, and spoke of monthly concerts as a
method of keeping up the interest in the
work.
The salient feature of the evening ses
sion was the discussion on the question,
"Is Congregationalism drifting away from
vital truth, or is it taking the tile at the
flood and entering into vital truth?"
Dr. Rader read a paper in reply to the
question, in the course of which he inti
mated that it was not necessary to believe
the story of Jonah and the wtiale in order
to gain eternai life. It was not an essen
tial. The following extracts will show the
scope of the essay:
It sounds well to say that you accept every
thing in the whole book from cover to cover,
but the statement does not accomplish ant
thing. Statements to the contrary must be
matched by statements. Ridicule is not argu
ment; denunciation is uot logic. The only
theological safety is freedom in Christian in
quiry.
1 confess moreover to a little surprise at the
treatment accorded Lyman Abbottof Biook
lyn, who, more than any other man of his
generation, is translating the doctrines of the
Bible into the language of the people. No the
ological seminary influences as many minds
as this modest Christian preacher. No man
who has ever assumed the difficult task of giv
ing popular instruction to the peoDle concern
ing the vital truths of Christianity has suc
ceeded in being so fair with his opponents or
so gracious in the presentation of the truth.
For many successive Sunday evenings lie has
crowded the great Plymouth Church, and
after eacb sermon he has permitted the peo
ple to ask him as many questions as they
chose, in order that the tram might be made
plain. As I can imagine Lyman Abbott sit
ting there before that throng, teaching them
the Bible, I can conceive of no nobler picture
ot Congregationalism. The Don Quixotes who
go through the land assaulting w^idmills and
advertising their theological nostrums and
settling for all time this question are not to
be compared with such a spirit and such a
man, and 1, for one. am quite willing to mod
estly, yet hearlily.conimend Lyman Abbott for
the gentle spirit of his scholarship and for
leading thousands of people out into a more
rational interpretation of the Scriptures.
There is a certain powerful positive spirit
re-enforcirir the message ana animating the
man, which leads many good Congregational
ism to believe that the time is not far distant,
ii it is not already here, when the Abbott type
of thought rather than the Behreod type will
become ihe exponent of progressive and vital
Congregationalism.
I have thus far confined my remarks to the
controversy about the Bible. May 1 conclude
this portion of the address with the thought
that the drift is in the direction of vital truth
as that truth is apprehended by common
sense, ratio ial thought and a profounder aud
more discriminating faith in the Bible as con
taining the word of God.
After brief addresses by Revs. Hill
Tubbs, Lloyd, Scuddej and Deacon Dexter',
the conference closed with hymns and
benediction.

Here is a man who had spent thousands of dollars without finding relief until he
got the grandest of all remediesâ ' v ; ' ' '
THE ELiBOTRO-MHDICALj TREATMENT.
AS GOOD FOR WOMEN AS MEN.
The application of this treatment for all forms of rheumatism, including acute,
chronic, sciatic, inflammatory and muscular, has met with amazing success. Cures
are effected in every instance. In some cases the cures are little less than miraculous,
for the treatment succeeded where every other remedy had failed. Of this electro-
medical treatment it can truly be said it is a treatment that cures and ft cure that
will last.
Under no circumstances should. the Electro-Medical Cure be confounded with the
ordinary electric treatment as applied by common batteries or with such crude mag-
netic appliances as electric belts and the like. The Electro-Medical Cure is different
in fundamental principle, different in application ana different in effect.. This com-
bined Electro-Medical treatment cannot be obtained at any other place than at the
Institute, as it is their own original discovery. The equipment of the Institute is
superb, and includes thousands of dollars' worth of apparatus and instruments. Call
and inspect it. The visit will cost you nothing.
If y. v cannot call, write for full particulars.: Don't delay. -Nothing Is more impor-
tant than your health. .A little neglect now may cause you years of suffering. Address

WINNING FORM
Four Heavily Backed
Choices Score at
Ingleside.
Tfce Extensively Piayed Wheel
of Fortune Beaten by
Howard S.
Game Morte Fonse Snatched a Race
From the Coalsâ Torsida Took
Another Purs?.
Juat for a change the first choices took
a hand at the bat yesterday and home
rung were very much in order. Six
heavily played favorites were sent to the
post, four reaching there in safety and
eventually scoring. To be sure the fur
nished rooms to let sign was not dis
played on tbree or four of them at the
plate, but they won by a margin, big
enough to allow of their jubilant backers
cashing. The attendance was large and
the betting much livelier than on the
opening day of the week.
One of the saddest dumps of the day, as
well as one of the most expensive to
favorite-players, was the downfall of
Wheel of Fortune, tne 1 to 6 choice for the
final event of the afternoon, a seven-fur
long purse run. The chestnut mare's en
thusiastic admirers overlooked the fact
that she lately had two very hard races
one in the Burns handicap, the other in
the Palace Hotel stakeâ and threw their
coin in as though it were oil out of the
can. The "Wheel" was not up to very
much, and although she responded gamely
and honestly to Henneeays call, was
beaten hands down by the Drown Whistle
jacket co t, Howard 8, whicti, ridden by
Joe Pigcott, finished witn a slipped bead
â tail. The winner opened at ."> to 2, with
worlds of Hi to 5 obtainable around bugle
call time.
Gaiiie old Morte Fonse, starting a 1 to 2
chaace for the mile and a quarter tour,
finally managed to land the purse after
nearly causing a score of deaths from
heari failure. After being cut off on two
or three occasions, and with Howard and
Can't Dance ahead of him a furlong from
the wire, Jimmy Bozeman, who had the
mount, saw a small gap between the fence
and Hazard, and took a chnr.ee. It was a
desperate one, but was rewarded with suc
cess, and Morte deieatc! Can't Dance by
three parts of a length in 2:12)Â£.
The even-money favorue, forsida, for
the opening two-year-old event at four fur !
:onps, played in great luck. Little |T iG
and Mis? Dividend made the running, and
fifty yards from the wire the latter filly
looked to have the race won, when
Thompson, forgetting to hug the rail in
his exuliation at having beaten off T G,
Hlloweit Willie Martin on tbe favorite to
slip through and win by a scant half
iength. Little T G tired badly, but finished
a close third.
Kd Corrigan's mare Queen Nubia ;
looked to a royal chance for the next
event, a cheap six-furlong se ling sprint,
but showed to very poor advantage, never
being able to eet io the front. Bozemai.
astride the If) to 5 second choice, Santa
PanJa, rained his mount out in front, ,
and. maintaining his lead to tbe end, won '
by a J.e?d in tne slow time of 1:17',.,. ReeÂ«,
which finished third, should have bc#n i
closer up with a more experienced boy
than S.Â°v^ns i.i the saddle.
The third erent, a nve and a half fur- i
long scramble with tbe scale of weights !
raised ten pounds above the scale, was
captured by the Corngan entry Redding
ton, ruling a 2 to 1 favorite. ThÂ»- rank
outsiuer Myrtie Â±f, with William Pinker
ton at her heels, led to the stretch. Here
Reddingtnn ran around tbe bunca and
taking command won ridden out from ihe
peculiarly na Jen second choice Peixotto.
Encinn finished in the show.
Pai Dunne and his friends all placed
their ciiecks aoww good and hard on

Tulare to win the tilth run on the card, a
six furlong selling spin. Opening a: pvene
the gelding receded to 7 to 5, when he was
piayed down again. Willie Martin, who
had the mount, allowed Loulou R and
Nebula to cut out a very hot clip to the
stretch, when he moved up from third
place and in a drive beat Nebula a head.
Mercutio got the show.
NOTKS.
Five out of six of the selections given in
The Call yesterday were winning ones,
the last four races being called one, two.
There wai considerable adverse criticism :
over the ride furnished by Coady on Peix- j
otto. . It did look a trifle off-color and
tardy, but then the chestnut la a very
cranky actor, and possibly the boy han
died him to the best advantage.
Considerable was expected of La Mar
oma, but she balkeo. about as soon as the
' barrier flew up, and fell back in the ruck.
Pat Dunne had a fair-sized b-t down on
the chances of Howard S. The brown colt
was ready money yesterday.
Shields, who rode William Pinkerton,
claimed to have been fouled by Redding
ton, but it is more than likely his mount
was beaten when the bumping occurred.
Our Climate, which started in the third
event, utterly disgusted Eastern visitors.
He was dished up for a watermelon carv
ing and became lost in the tog. ,-,,-'

Kxperts of the (imnd Jury Are Prepar
ing an Klaborate Kpport From the
Book* of the Commission.
The Grand Jury experts who have been
eng.tgeti lor the last three weeks in an ex
amination of the booics and accounts of
the Golden liate Park Commission have
very nearly completed the work assigned
to there.
The foreman of the Grand Jury, Raph
ael Peixotto, tbe secretary, William E.
Lutz, aad M. Fragley, Waiter is*. Brunt,
Aureiius E. Buckingham and P. O.
Atieme, of tue jury committee on parks
and squares, nelu a session yesterday fore
noon at tbe lodge in GoUl*n Gate Park.
The report, wnen submitted to ihe jury,
will contain an itemized statement oi all
iransactions involving th<" expenditures
of money from July 1, 1896, to Apri* ]
1897.
So far as can be ascertained the records
and accounts of tbe commission are ample
and plain. At first glance the cost of fuel
and forage seems excessive, but when
quality is considered and extra cost of de
livery at the park is taken into account
the sums expended are lound to be rea
sonable.

HE OBJECTS TO
FURTHER BURIALS
The Mayor Calls Attention
to Violations of the
Law.
Board of Health Takes Cogni
zance of the Rapid Spread
of Diphtheria.
The Chemist cf the Department Makes
Another Report on Adulterated
Fruits.
Mayor Phelan called the attention of
the members of the Board of Health at
yesterday's meeting to the fact thai the
law regarding the burial 3in cemeteries
within the City limits is being constantly
violated. He stated that in spite of the
fact that the Board uf Supervisors had by
ordinance prohibited the sale of lots the
cemetery associations had paid no atten
tion to the matter, and asked the board
whether it had ever given any expression
of its feelings regarding burials within the
City limits. He said that he objected to
the cemeteries because they barred the
march of progress, and asked the board to
consider the matter with a view to taking
act on from a sanitary point of view.
The members agreed to do so. Dr.
Williamson of the Hospital Committee
stated tbat only a little more than $13,000
remained in the City and County Hospital
luiid for the rest of (he fiscaiyear and
that a >hortage cf $6000 was certain. He
ventured an opinion that tne detic.l
Would have to bs made up by public sub
scription. Mayor Phelan stated that the
boarl had better not put much faith in
public generosity, but practice more
economy.
Dr. Williamson, as chairman of the
Committee on Epidemics and Contagious
Diseases, reported that since A-prll 1 twen
ty-nine cases of diphtheria, including
fifteen from the Children's Hospital, had
been reported, and called attention to the
rat.id increase over the rate of last montti.
He al<o directed the attention of the
board to the fact that since January 1
there had been twenty-one deaths from
membranous croup and stated that it was
a fair presumption that some of the cases
called croup were in reality diphtheria.
He made a recommendation, wuich was
adopted, that in future physician* be
compelled to report all cases of mem
branous croup, and ibat the use of steril
ized awabs be required as in cases of diph
theria, In order that the true nature of
trie disease may be ascertained.
In regard to contagious diseases in the
puohc schools Dr. Williamson reported
as follows:
My attention has been called to tbefact that
the principals and teachers ol the public
schools are negligent In the matter ol refus
ing admittance to the schools of pupils whose
homes are under quarnntine for contagious
diseases. Jt has been reported at the Health
Office that the principal if tnÂ« Denman School
allowed two pupiiH to be admitted to ;hat
school in whose residence there was a case of
scarletina'at the lima of their admits on i
would offer as a cuggtstion in this instance
that the hÂ«alth officer be instructed to address
an official communication to the Superin
tendent of Public instruction, calling his at
tention to such irregularities on the part of
principals and teachers.
It was decidtd to Mild a circular to the
railroad companies, calling their atten
tion to the law providing that permits
must be obtained for the shipping of the
bodies of deceased parson-' out of this
City, and also that a fee of flu is payable
for each of such permits. The statement
was made that this law had been openly
violated In a large number of instance!".
On the recommendation of the Ambu
lance (station and Receiving Hospital
Committee Dr?. E. E Hill Â«nd K. E.
Hartley were appointed ambulance sinr-
Rc-ons at $75 per month, each to take office
on June 20. A recommendation by the
same committee that a vote of thanks be
tendered the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners for its co-operation with the
Health Department in esiablishinu an
ambulance staiicn and building on the
water front was adopted.
DrÂ». Hill ana Hartley are both well
known young physicians, the lattor hav
ing been an interne at the Receiving Hos
pital.
Dr. Fiizgibbon, chairman of the com
mittee on nuisance;, reported that the
charges of unsanitary condition made
against the National Fertilizer Company,
in an anonymous communication ad
dres-ed to the Mayor, were without foun
dation.
A; communication signed by numerous
residents of the Excelsior Homestead re
quested the board to co-operate with the
Board of Supervisors in improving the
sanitary condit on of dairy ranches in that
locality.
The chemist of the board reported on
nfty-nine samples of preserved iruits con
sisting mainly ol jellies. Nine samples
were found to be pure, eleven adulterated
within the meaning of the pure-food law,
and twenty-rive fraudulent counterfeits.
The report was referred to the pure food
committee, which will take action look
ing toward the arrest and prosecution in
cases where drastic measures are deemed
advisable and appropriate.

Members of the Board of
Health Must Pay
Bills.
Demands That Were Not Pay
able Out of the Public Purse
Reje:ted.
A N-w Attorney, Whose Salary May
Not B? Forthcoming â Garret
McEuerney's Opinion-
It is quite likely that the members of
the Board of Health wili have to pay out
of their own pockets the expenses of that
little junketing trip to Sacramento during
the last session, when several employes
went along to try to lobby through a num
ber of bills that the board wanted passed.
According to the demands presented to
the Auditor the trip cost about $375, but
the bills were not itemized.
Mr. tfroderick refused to sign the de
mands on the ground that there was no
law or authority for sucn expenditures.
At the same time he refused to sign a de
mand for $200, as payment for a set of
engrossed resolutions presented to Attor
ney J. li. Keinstein, who, though not in
any way connected with the board, gave
his services gratuitously in the planning
of the pure food cru?ade. This bill the
members will undoubtedly have to pay
out of their own resources.
Yesterday at the meeting of the board
Garret W. JMcEnerney, the attorney of
the board, rendered the following opinion
in the matter of the bills in response to a
request from Dr. Morse:
Dr. J. F. Morte, Board of Health, City Hall,
Cityâ MY Dear Sir: In answer to your letter
of the 15th lnÂ»U in relation to the two de
mands now pending before the Auditor,
namely, one for abouts37s, expenses incurred
at Sacramento during the nession of the Legis
lature, and the other for $200, expended in
engrossing resolutions, 1 teg to say that in
myjudgmeat neither demand constitutes a
charge against tha City and County.
It is undoubtedly true thai the expenses in
curred by the members of the board and by its
officers in attempting to promote thÂ« passage
of legislation which wou.d be conducive to
the general welfare is a matter of expense
that might be properly borne by the public
funds. The theory of th* mntter, however, is
ttiat it is no part of the official duty of a pub
lic officer to attempt to secure the "passage oi
necessary legislation. It is the theory that all
necessary legislation will find iw origin in the
legislative department, and thai li is not
necessary lor any offiier, except a member of
the Legislature, to either suggest or attempt
to KÂ«cure tne passage of needful legislation.
The other demaiui, I am very sorry to say, I
do not believe can be made the subject of an
appropriation fiom the public fundn.
These are my views ou the subject. I have
no doubt of their correctness, but if you de
sire it we can test the matter in the courts,
and I shall be glad to comply with any desire
you may have in the matur. Very trul â¢.
Garrkt W. McExkrxey.
Dr. Morse was appointed a committee
to comait with Mr. McEuerney on the sub
ject.
Then the board took another action that
may cost it a great deal of money before it
is through with. It passed the following
resolution:
Whereas, The Board of Health of the City
and County of San FranciÂ«co deems It neces
sary 10 appoint in employe ol tao Health in
partment to aid and assist the Health Officer
and tne Health Department, and give legal
counsel, therefore be it
Xesolved, That the office of Assisiant Attorney
tor the Health Officer and the Health Depart
ment is hereby created. UTbe duties of such
officer are, to be in attendance at the Health
Cflice daily, except Sundays and holidays, be
tween the hours of 9 *nd 10 o'clock a. m\. and
3 to 4r. M., and he is to act at any other time
his services may be required as legal adviser to
the Health Officer and the Health Department,
and he is lurt.'ier required to make such pro e
cutions and other legal procedures as the
Health Officer and the Health Department
may onier. And be it further
Resolved, That the compensation of such As
Â«i*tant Attorney be and hereby is fixed at the
sum of two hundred ($200) dollars per month.
Mayor Pbelan oojecied. He wanted to
know the board's authority for making
such an appointment, where the money
â¦o pay the new employe 'was to come
from and why the attorney now in office
at a salary of $3000 a year does not do the
work?
He was not satisfied with the explana
tions given and voted against the measure.
The board will run against n more seri
ous snag when it tackles Auditor Broder
ick. That official says that unless he is
shown some better leason for signing
than he has at present the assistant attor
ney's demands will not receive his signa
ture.
"This board is merely making places,"
he said, "and I am going to stop the
drains on the treasury if possible. There
is neither necessity nor authority for this
new otncial as far as I can see at present,
and if they want him so bad let them pay
him themselves."

A'KW YORK, N. V., April 20.â Prices of AmerL
can securities in London this raornlnz indicated
that New York ha 1 exasperated the effect of the
Gneeo- Turkish war yesterday and overso d. There
was. consequently, â  lively scramble to cover at j
opening, i tie dealings weie characterized by great
activity, large blceWs O' stocks changing hands,
but some heaviness was shown in Industrial stocks ;
after the initial prices.
P ofit-:ut:ing caused slight shading of values,
with off -rings rattier limited. Tfce bulls, however,
soon resumed control of fie market and advanced
some international values to Hie top level.
The tone of the market continued strong and
with en Jidv. nc tendency evident tlirougnout j
the list up tomiduxy. Buying national stocks '
ti â â  London was a factor In the improvement. â 
Bond market a so strong.
Business on the .>mcc Exchange eona:s ed in j
the main of repurchases of stock sold yt-s.erday.
'J here was however. Â» little buy iiig of a more sub- j
stantial character. In a number of stocks the I
d- dines record* d yester.'ay weie more than re- ;
covered. The volume of tradni: was not as large a*
yesterday, but ra her better d:sLributed. Of spe
cific- developments tie most Important, perhaps,
was a .statement of exports from, this port for be
week, showing an increase of $1,000,000. or about
14 per cm; over the previous week*. The closing
was strong at a fractional reac lon from the best
prices.

THE STOCK MASZET.
Mining stocks opened firm enough, but declined
as the day went on and were weak and quieter In
the afternoon.
l he news which caused the recent advance in
Consolidated California and Virginia was that in
working north on the ore streak along the io:u
wall Â»0 feet above the 165 level of the mine the
Ftrealc which was reported in the last official
letter to be 1 foot wide, assaying from 40 to *50
per ton. had widened to 2 feet and assayed $200
and upward per ton. The direction In which the
north drirt is going is toward the Oi.hir mine.

More th*n a thousand people crowded
into the oid People's Tnenter to-dny to
witness the funeral of Mrs. Sergeant-
Jlajor Brown. The Snlvat.onists have a
unique way of conducting a funeral, and
it never seems to be v.ith them an occa
sion of sorrow. Even in the presence of
death they seem to lose none of that buoy
ancy of spirit which msr'^s their lives.

larly simple, bat w.thal tenderly impres

the platform and all around it were floral
tributes from her many comrades and
friends.
The officers who look part in the ser
vices were: Ensign Bprague, Staff Captain
Mrs. Merr. weather. Captain Lvon, Major
ami Mrs. Melntyre and the cadets.
To . uliy appreciate the beauty of the
scene it is almost necessary to understand
the religious principles that the army
teaches The confidence of their allusions
to a better land and thÂ» freedom with
vrhic:i they speak of subjects which ortho
ticx Christian^ are accustomed to handle
delicately would from the mouths of
I*od c less sincere be almost character
ized as levity, fetich a suggestion, how
ever, would be woefully out of place at an
army funeral.
Near the coffin stood Sergeant-Major
Brown, the husband of the deceased, find
in hit arms was the little 13-months-old
child whose mother was in the coffin. A
young son bat on a chair near by, and
teemed as unable to realize the solemnity
of the occasion as the infant, which, at the
time while its bereaved father was sneak
ing of the example set by his wiie, reached
out its tiny hands and uttered a simple
word, at the same lime seeming surprised
that it met with no response.
Captain Lyon and Miss Alice Sturtevant,
who had been intimate acquaintances of
the deceased, told of her iifeworK and the
consistency to her principles, both at
home and when in tne hall.
There were a few songs by members of
the army, and Major Mclntyre brought
the ceremonies to a close with a few well
chosen remark".

and a ler the benediction fully 1000 peo

A " SUGAR-COATED" POLICY
President Bonne Kxplains Something
of HU Attitude Toward the
School Department,
BERKELEY, Cal.. April 20.â President
P. R. Boone of the Berkeley Board of
Education placed himself on raconi last
night as having adopted since his election
to his present office a sugar-coated policy
to conceal the weaknesses of the publio
schools and to arrest criticism These
startling statements were made before the
board at their regular semi-monthiy meet
ing in his annual written report. Turn
ing from his '\-ugar-coated" policy, as he
described it, he severely criticized the de
partment, ref-rring particularly to the
Stagnation in the system which at present
prevails. Said Mr. Boone:
Since I became your president I have
adopted c. sugar-i oau-<l policy to conceal the
weakness of the sctiool* pnd to arrest criticism.
But now ray sucnr is exhausted and Mie oublic
is cau-hinf? on to my little game. Whatever I
hay >fvid or written in public about the
i schools nas a.ways been In the language of
flattery. I trusted that in the meantime end
before the people were wiser we should have
covered up the graves of the department ana
the publ:c would have seen but a monument
of tile luiure mid not a reminder of the past.
The department is suffr-rine. In efficiency
of scholarship we have made but little projj
ress in the last two years, and we shall make
less In years to come, unless the board takes
some decide. l step. Towns half the size of
ours are making greater strides; they have
superior schools; the? exce: us because ttieir
svs;cm Is more comnleie. And yet tnls Is
Berkeley! the seat of learning, and the town
of all others which the people of the State
should look up to.
I trust the board will soon devise some
means to arrange t-ie course of study, so as to
provide for hull-year promotions. It is well
understood tiiattiiere are some pupils in all
the grades cupable of more rapid progress
than others; and then there are those
wno may be almost ready at the end of
the year for promotion to another grade,
but who are possibly lacking in par
tial studies, who cannot be advanced to a
higher tjrad^ because of this deficiency, but
whom a half year's work would qualify. It
seems hardly just to either of the cia&se* of

the ones that reap the greatest harvest.
Some offer as hi h as $5 for a nickel and

make something.
"I shall not object to anything that can
be letfaily done," saM M iyor Thomas to

against gambling includes the machine

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. APRIL 21, 1897.
THE CRIME WILL
GO UNPUNISHED
Anna Johnson's Dying
Words Ruled Out as
Evidence.
Dr. Sharpe, the e ister and Lover
of the Dead Girl Are
Released.
The Jury Dd Not Like to Say "No
Guilty," but They Had No
Alternative.
Oakland Office San Frakcipoo Call,)
908 Broadway, April 20. f
Annie Jonnson was murdered and no
one will have to answer for the crime.
The charges against Dr. Sbarpe, Jacc
Howard the motor-man and Uuldah John
son wera all stricken from the calendar
to-day because of a technicality in the
dying statement of the murdered girl.
When Anna Johnson believed she was
going to die she consented to make an
ante-mortem statement. It was attested
before Notary Public Keeney, and when
the dying girl signed ii she made the fol
lowing remark: "If I die return this to
the authorities, but if I lire return it to
me. 1 '
The prosecution at the last session of
court had reached that portion of its case
with the introduction of the girl's dying
statement.
Attorney Francrieur for the defense ar
gued against its admission on the ground
that the expression of the girl when she
signed it made it clear that she did not
mate it at a time when she had ,10 idea
of recovering. As the statute requires
that the deponent under such circum
stances must have given up all hope of
life the attorney objected to its admission
in evidence.
The case was taken under advisement
and to-day Judge O?den addressed the
jury as follows: "The de:endant, Howard.
19 charged with murder. To convict a
man of this charge the evidence of guilt
must be conclusive. In this case it ap
pears from the statement of the District
Attorney that there is no such legal evi
dence and it remains for us to discharge
the prisoner, and it is, therefore, your
duty to return and it is the advice of the
court that you do return a verdict of not
guilty."
Captain H. Tboelken arose and stated
that unless they were ordered to bring in
such a verdict they would not agree on
that point, for some of the jurors had
made up their minds that such a verdict
waa not justified. "No other verdict will
De accepted by the court," said Jmlge Og
den, "and if another one is brought iv it
will be Â«t aside." The jury retired ami
deliberated for fifteen minutes before they
could agree to accept the court's instruc
tion.
The case against Dr. Sharpe was called
before Jiidce Hall and also dismissed.
Huldab Johnson, Jack Howard and Dr.
Sharpe walked from the courtroom smil
ing and after congratulating each other
walked away free.

The New Fire Department Law.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 20.â The last
Legislature, for s-ome reason unknown to
most of those interested, passed a law
makinc the office of chief engineer of the
Fire Department in cities of the fifth class, !
to which Al:imeda telongs, elective. The j
point was mi ed that thÂ« new IJoard of I
Trustees, which last night passed a resoiu- !
tion declaring that and all otuer ap
pointive offices vacant after the first of
next month, had thereby createu a va
cancy which they h:.d no power to fill,
Nevertheless they tilled it by reappointing
Fred K. Krauth Jr. to the position. It
seems that the law did not contain the
usual provision that the act should go
into effect from and after its pas-age and
accordingly it conies under the Drovision
C. K, KING, Grand Marshal of the Decoration Day Parade.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 20.â Colonel F. H. King has been chosen as grand marshal of
the Memorial day parade to be held in this city. The veicrsns are making unusual pre
parations for an extensive diiplaV'on that day. Last year there whs a very unpleasant Inci
dent at the Memorial day exercises. Rightly or wrongly Lyon Post had been suspended
for ninety days ior a breach of discipline, and it was held that owing to the suspension of
their charter they could not take any part as a post in Memorial day exercises. Inconse
quence of this they went out to the cemetery last Memorial day, and while the dew was
yet on the grass they decorated the craves of their comrades, held a few simple ceremonies
and returned before the regular Memorial day exercises were held.
This year, however, the celebration will be somewhat in the nature of a reunion,
and with the exception of a few who have been called away during the past two years the
comrades will inarch side by tide v in the past.
that such laws ao not *o into force until
sixty days from pas<ape. This save the
Trustees the opportunity to make the re
appomtment and they took advantage
of it.

ObÂ«Â«quiea.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 20.â Within
the gaze of a throng of over 3000 specta
tors the freshmen at the State University
celebrated the burial of Bourdon and
Nimto to-night, marking one of the most
brilliant events of the Kind ever held in
Berkeley. It was not, however, until they
had fought their way through the small
array of sophomores, who were scattered
over the route of travel and who offe.ed
a powerful rests ance to the oncoming foe.
At 8 o'clock the procession of freshmen
started from North Berkeley, accompany
ing the coffin in wh.ch were deposited a
copy of Minto's Manual and Algebra.
They passed through the s:reeis sur
rounding with a hollow square the huÂ«e
truck on whicn were the coffin and the
speakers of tne evening. A continual
stream of tireworks was set off along the
route of travel.
They first tried to gain entrance to the
campus by the lower southern Kate, but
the sophs had barred the way with a
water wagon. Tiie procession then head
ed for the other entrance farther east.
Upon arriving t ere they caught the
sophs in the act of cutting down and
burning the bridge across Strawberry
Creefc.
The '99 men were soon overpowered and
the bridge was pussed. Having reached
the ciimpus, half their battle was won.
Though one by one the guards about
the wagon were picked off and bound
hand and foot, enouith were lleti t to carry
out the ceremony of burning the coffin.
Amid a most deafening tumult and a
shower of rotten ej?:s the cremation took
place, and the lreshmen gave their war
dance about the ashes ot the coffin. A. J.
Cloud was Pontiiex Maximum, Charles
Dorety and Ruy Young were Laulators,
George Brehm Datnnator, Jesse Jlenden
hall Imprecator and Henry Robinson and
C Garrison, Muledictors.

Pecallar Lettering That la Either a
Miritcte or a. limn.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 20.â Mrs. W. J.
Haney found an.egg in her yard a few
days ago which ia a mystery. In raised
letters on the shell maybe read in dis
tinct outline the following words, "Good
Times in 1897. Mrs. McKinley."
"A week or two Â»go," shefrp marked, "I
went to gfttner up the eggs at dusk. As I
took a dozen or so out of a nest I saw
writing on one of them. On entering the
Louse I lighted the lamp and showed it to
my husband. At first he was inclined to
laugh at me, but on examination we were
both startled to find the egg as you now
see it"
The egg is of ordinary size and the let
ters are about the size of newspaper type,
and are of exactly the same material as
the shell, but are raised aoove the level.
All kind? of theories ot miracles and prac
tical jokes have been advanced, but the fact
remains that Mr*. Haney showe I the egg
to a reporter to-day bearing the peculiar
lettering and declares that she would not
part with it for a hundred dollars.

Mysterious Mission of One Who

His Story of Why Spain Is Certain to

/_--/â -;.
Benor Guilliamo Enrique Eliseo, a tall,
bronzed and quite handsome man who
registered from Mexico, but who is said to
be a native of Cuba, a high officer in the
ranks of the revolutionists and to have
large landed interests in the "Pearl of the
Antilles," is at the Palace.
He arrived here on Sunday and has
since had many caller*. Yesterday he
was very busy with his correspondence.
He brought to bis aid the services of a
lady typewriter and rattled off letter after
letter, dispatching them to New York,
SENOR GUILLIAMO ENRIQUE ELISEO, the Cuban Patriot,
"Who Is Now Here.
Mexico, Cuba, Washington and pretty
much all over. It is stated that Senor
EliÃeo, who is about 30 years old, scholarly
and diplomatic, ia an agent of the Cuban
cause. He has plenty of money and
spends it with an open hand.
Senor Eliseo arrived in this country, so
he says, wixty-ibree days since, and has
been traveling almost all the time. He
has visited New York and Washington
and stopped at different places on his
way out to Denver. There he was inter
viewed, or rather a story wa^ writ
ten about him. W;th it appeared a
picture of the Cuban. The story was that
Senor Eliseo was the son ot a millionaire
Cuban planter, who had raised large sums of
money to carry on the war. It added
that the Senor was himself immensely
wealthy and ad extensive interests all
over tne world. It was s ated further that
he had come West partly on mining busi
ness.
The man to whom so much was credited
showed the Btory, which had oeen fur
nished him by a friend. He said it badly
m.srep esento i hint.
"1 cannot go into details as to who I
am," he said, "because 1 have no wish to
reveal my identity. But 1 hare been
pretty much over this country in the last
sixty-three days. Aftor I left Denver I
went to Oregon and Washington. I am
now on my way to Mexico, and en route
wiil stop at Los An eles and Â£1 Paso.
"Now, about the war in Cuba, I can tell
you we expect it will last five years
longer. It will be dragged out like the
ten years' war, the last one we had. We
are going to just let it drag alon_. In tn
end Cuba will win, but before the war is
ended there will he a coi.il ft be
tween the United States and Spain.
The reason is this. Spain nas be
tween 18,000,000 and 20,000.000 peopie,
and Cuba but about 2,000,000. Well,
Spain which once owned .he whole
of this great country, and ad possessions
all over the lobe, naÂ» lost ai; excepting
Cuba. It would be disgraceful if Spain
lost Cuba, and if she <loes lose Cuba there
will be a revolution in Spain and Alpbonso
will not be King. Spain wiil be are pub
lic. When Spain finds at last that she
must lose Cm -a she will commit some
oven aci against the United States, in
volve this country i:i a war with her and
get whipped by 'he United States, because
she will regard it more creditable than to
be deleaied by little Cuba al â¢mp.
'So we are just eoing along and letting
things wenr <ut. We are not in a hurry,
but we will tight to the la-t. Cuba is a
little close for money now. There is about
$30,000 tied up in this country, $11,000 of
whiih is on account i-i Genera^ Rotaljo.
You see, bo many bonds have had to be
put up for different persons that it has
made things a little slow.
"I am afraid the Giffico-Turkish war will
hurt Cuba a litile in drawing away inter
est from it, but all over America more
than three-fourths of the people have
always been heart and soul with the revo
lutionists.
"In Cuba we haven't been fighting very
bard lately. We are laying off and wait
ing for the cholera. Tuo cholera is our
greate-t ally. It will begin again about
the 2Cth of next month."
Senor Eliseo wore magnificent jewels.
On two fingers of his left hand were heavy
gold rings set with diamond*, rubies and
other stones. In his tie was a Cuban bat,
the top of which was a large pearl and
the remainder diamonds. On his lapel
was the ensign of the dauntless "Pearl of
the Antilles," consisting of a single star
in a red field, irom which ex. ended three
oars of blue and two of white. Translated
into Englis i Mr. Kiiseo's name would be
William Henry El Is.

DURRANT
MAY HAVE
A CHANCE
Prison Directors in Favor of
a Commutation of
Sentence,
HIS TRIAL DECLARED UNFAIR.
Strong Belief Expressed That Governor Budd
Will Temper the Decree of Judge
Bahrs to Imprisonment
for Life*
Fifty days hence, if tiie law's decrae as
pronounced by Judge Bahrs is carried
out, Theodore Durrant will be hanged by
tne neck until he is dead.
But each passing nay, it is claimed by
those who have doubts of his guilt, by his
attorneys and by his friends and relatives,
adds to the number who are in favor of
his sentence being commuted to life im
prisonment. The most significant ex
piestions along this line come from no
less important officials than members of
the Board of Prison Directors.
It is true that they have no legal power
to change the fate of the doomed man, but
as an advisory body to tne Governor their
influence would mean much to the pris
oner.
In no case have they the power to grant
pardons or temjer justice with leniency.
Petitions for pardons or commutation of
sentence are simply referred to them lor
their consideration, and should they deem
any particular case worthy of favorable
action, they communicate their views to
the Governor, with whatever recommen-
dation they consider proper tinder the
circumstances. While the Governor has
invariably heeded such suggestions as the
Directors may make, lie in still absolutely
free to pass upon the matter as he thinks
fit.
In capital cases, however, the board as
sumes not even this advisory duty unless
it is specially imposed on it by tbe Gov
ernor, as was done in the case of the
dimming* brothers, sentenced to death
from San Bernardino. In that case ttie
Governor had about made up his mind to
commute their sentence to life imprison
ment, but before doing so referred the
matter to the Prison Directors, telling
them frankly of the bent of his mind.
After due consideration of the testimony
and of the case in all its phases the board
eonveyea t* the Governor its agreement
witn his views, and the commutation fol
lowed in due course.
It is very probable that should the Gov
eruor be petitioned for commutation in
behalf of Durrant, as it is announced that
he will be. he wiil again call upon the
board to pass unoa the matter.
It is positively known thai two mem
bers of the board â De Pue and Fitzgerald
â are of the opinion thai Durrant did not
have a fair trial, and that they are in
clined to favor a commutation of sentence
to life imprisonment. Another of the
directorsâ Devlinâ asserts that he is open
to the conv.ction that Durrant did not
have a fair trial, and might be influenced
to advise lor a comniuiation, while the re
maining twoâ Hayes and Wilkinsâ are
strongly opposed to any clemency being
t xerc'sed.
The most startling expression elicited
yesterday was from Director Have*, who
gave it as h.s unqualified opinion" that no
one wouid see Durrant hanged for the
reaÂ°on that there would be no execution
on June 11; that Governor Budd would
commute ttie sentence of the convicted
murderer to life imprisonment.
WILL NOT BE HANGED.
Prison Director Hayes Says That
Is His Opinion Concerning
Durrant.
Prison Director Daniel E. Hayes said
that he thought it possible, and, indeed,
very likely that Governor Buda mipht
atk the advice of the Prison Directors con
cerning the commutation of Durrant's sen
tence if any great pressure should be
JfEW TO-DAT.

it is a pretty sure sign that his digestion is
out of order â that his principal trouble is
constipation. If he lets this condition run
on, there is no telling where it will stop.
Nine -tenths of all human sickness comes
from constipation. The first thing that
every doctor asks when he is called to see a
patient is whether the bowels are in good
order. It is nonsense to call a doctor for
such a simple thing. It is nonsense to let
such a simple thing grow into such a serious
thing, as it always does if neglected. Dr.
Pierce s Pleasant Pellets cure constipation.
They not only afford immediate and pleas-
ant relief from all the distressing symp-
toms, but they cure permanently and posi-
tively. There are 10,000 medicines that can
be taken, to give temporary relief. The
" Pleasant Pellets" are the only things that
really cure.
There are plenty of druggists who will
try to sell you something else. You know
just as well as we do that an honest
druggist wouldn't do such a thing â
that an honest druggist would give you
what you ask for. You know that when a
druggist insists on giving you something
else, there must be a reason for it. We
know what that reason â he makes a big-
ger profit on the other thing. Any drug-
gist in America will supply the "Pellets'*
if you insist on it.

brought to bear sufficient to indicate any
public sentiment in favor of such fiction.
"There was the case of tbe Cummin^s
brothers," said Mr. Hayes," in which the
advice of the directors was asked concern
ing the commutation of their sentences.
That may be taken a3 a precedent, but 1
have little doubt the Governor would will
ingly shift the responsibility. But I would
not vote to commute Durrani's sentence if
the sense of the board was a>ked in the
matter. 1 have no doubt concerning the
fairne<s of the trial. D rrant had a fair
trial in my opinion. Perhaps I ought not
to say in advance how I as a member of
the board would vote in it supposititious
case, but that is the way I feel about it."
Prison Director Hayes further stated
that he does not believe Durrant will be
executed. Mr. Hayes' expression of
opinion was brought out while discussing
the morbid taste of the people who take
great delight in witnessing scenes that
terrify. At the last meeting of the Prison
Directors at San Qnentin on Saturday they
decided not to issue any more permits 10
witness the execution than is provided
for in the statutes. It was while speaking
of this action that Mr. Hayes said: "You
would be surprised to know what a rush
and scramble there is for invitations, or,
rather, permits, to see Theodore Durrant
hanged. Warden Hale bus received sev
eral hundred letters begging for pnsses to
witness the execution. I, too, have re
ceived many such requestsâ fully a hun
dred, lam sure. Many send letters and a
great many spend hours waiting to see
mr in order to ast for a permit. I have
received as many as a dozen letters from
people ;n the East who ask for
permits to see Durrant hanged and they
say that if their rrquests are granted they
will come to this coast at once in order tc
see him execute* . 1 have refused to grant
all such request* and so have the other
directors, and Warden Hale has been in
structed to act upon the lino of this pol
icy. You would be surprised to know the
names of some who are the most desirous
of witnessing the execution. You would
give them credit for better taste."
"But there will not Da any one to see
Durrant hanged," he added.
"How is that? What reasons have you
for believing that no one will see Durrant
executed?" was asked.
"I have reason to believe that Governor
Budd will commute the sentence to im
prisonment for life," was Director Hayes'
answer. Mr. Hayes would not state di
rectly what the reasons were on which the
Governor would interfere with the carry
ing out of the death sentence, but be in
timated that the circumstantial nature of
the evidence connecting the doomed man
with the murder of Blanche Lamont
would weigh greatly with Governor Budd
in Durrani's behalf.

NOT FAIRLY TRIED.
Emphatic Opinion Expressed by
Prison Director Fitzgerald Re
sardine tie Case.
Director Robert M. Fitzgerald was em
phatic ana outspoken in nis opinion re
garding Durrant.
"So far as the press and the public is
concerned," he said, "Durraat has not
had a fair show: he has not had the trial
intended by our institutions and our laws.
"I am not now entering into the ques
tion of his Ruilt or innocence. I believe
tuat it would be possible, with the press
and all the reporter* against a man, to
convict aim in a ca^e where there was no
guilt, and very easiiv. This phase of the
situation, I feel, is the most important in
tbe whole matter.
"I think that if some of the relatives of
the girls whom he is alleged to have mur
dered should shoot him, it would be but a
degree worse than the hue and cry that
ha* been raised in this case.
"This is ttie way 1 feel about the case
and have felt about it. I have not. from
what I have already read of the case, be
come convinced of his guilt. I think
there are a many who feel exactly
as I do. It seems for some reason or other
that people think it would be either un
popular or unwise to express their opin
ions. 1 don't feel so. 1 am as much
entitled to express my opinion as any
private individual, and do io now simply
as a citizen, and not as a member ot the
Board of Prison Directors.
"I.wish right here to say that I have
never had an individual speak to me in
Durrant's fivor. I never saw him except
on Saturday when he appeared before the
board, and 1 know none of his relatives in
any degree. I never saw one of them.
"The question of identity in this case
would leave absolutely no impression on
me. I have had actual experience where
evidence wub more positive, and yet it
turned out to be absolutely erroneous.
"The heat engendered by the excite
ment of the discovery of the double
tragedy and the trial of tbe accused is now
passing away, and I dÃily >cc indications
that people now recognize that Durrant
bits not had the fair and impartial trial
that he should have had."

do I think about tlÂ»e execution of Dur

Devlin to a Call representative this even
ing. "Why, really I have never given the
matter a thought. This in something

Dear Sir and Brother:
I am in receipt of your kind favor of April 5, and
beg to express my most hearty commendation of the proposition therein
contained. I am fully convinced that a day at the proper season
set apart as Lincoln day, with such public school services as you
suggest, would have a strong tendency toward impressing the youth
of our country with patriotic impulses. I will be glad to aid in
establishing such a day, and you may rely upon me to give the mat-
ter such encouragement as my limited time and my ability will permit .
Thanking you for your kindness in calling my attention to this im-
portant matter, I remain,
Dictated. Fraternally yours,
mitigating circumstances are extant, I
should judge that the sentence of the
court should be carried out."

MRS. DURRANT TALKS.
Knows Nothing: About Commuta
tion, but Insists Theodora
Is Innocent.
Theodore Durrant's father was not nt
his home, at 1025 Fair Oaks street, last
evening. At 10 :.'i0 o'clock he had not re
re turned and Mrs. Durrant had no idea
when he would b j in. As a consequence
no opinion or utterance could be secured
from Mr. Durrant last evening. Mr*.
Durrant listened attentively and with evi
dent interest to a statement that some of
the Board of Prison Directors might think
favorably ot commuting the sentence of
her son to life imprisonment, but she de
clined to express any opinion. "I have
not seen our attorneys to-day," she said,
"and Ido not want to say anything. Mr.
Durrant is out and may not be in for a
long time. Ido not know when he will
come in. Ido not think that he would
care to be interviewed. lam not at lib
erty to speak lor him. Since you ask it
1 suppose that I can say that he naturally
would like anything that would be favora
ble to Theodore, but understand clearly
that lam not speaking tor him. I know
nothing about any movement for tbe com
mutation of the sentence."
Mrs. Durrant stood at the half-opened
door of her home as she st>oke. Suddenly
she proclaimed anew her belief in the in
nocence of her son. Her hand shook and
her voice trembled as she said:
"My bay, my baby, is innocent." Tears
stood' in her eyes and her emotion was
litiful to witness. A little pause and she
went on: "On, what a persecution it has
Deen ; but I know that he is innocent;
that he is as innocent of the crime charged
against him as an unborn babe."
AT SAN QUENTIN.
The Days Are Fleeting: Toward the
Time of Execution.
SAN QUENTIN, Cal., April 20.â The
prison life of Theodore Durrant, convicted
of the murder of Blanche Lamont, is pass
ing without incident. The youthful mur
derer is a model prisoner. He complies
with the rules of the prison without a
sign of reluctence and has made friends
with the other prisoners in murderers'
row. His mother and father are his only
visitors, and the meetings between them
are always affecting.
No fear is lelt by the prison authorities
thai Durrant will attempt tn take his own
life, and the dreary uiievemful days are
slowiy dragging away and the fatal June
11 is drawing closer.
Stiil the Prison Directors and Warden
Hale are deluged by applications for
pastes to witness the hanging, but strin
gent rules are to govern the affair. I; is
not to be made a holiday occasion nor are
morbidly inclined to be in attendance.
The Prison Directors recognize that the
execution is a .rave occasion and not au
exhibition on theatrical lines.

SUCCESS OF THE SCHEME IS
ASSUBED.
Grand Arm* Po;ts in Department
Enc mpment Will Ins'o^e and
Aid the Movement.
The plan to erect in Golden Gate Park,
San Francisco, a monument to the mem
ory of Abraham Lincoln, which project
carries with it a proposition to create a
Lincoly day in the public schools of the
United States, meets with the readiest
recognition and most hearty support of
leading men and organizations through
out the Union.
The enthusiasm already awakened is a
surprise to the promoters of the patriotic
enterprise. W. W. Stone, president of the
Lincoln Monument League, the m&nfrom
whose mind the idea emanated, is himself
surprised at the magnitude of the success
already achieved. In an Interview Ja.-t
evening he said:
"To tell you the truth, we did not an
ticipate commencing public action on the
monument fund until after Memorial day,
but the enterprise of The Call in seizing
hold of the proposition and estimating Its
possibilities has resulted in almost carry
ing us off our feet in the rush of publicity.
Impatient demands are coming in from all
sides for certificates.
"Most of our executive board will start
on the morning train for Salinas. The de
partment encarnpmentof the Grand Army
of the Republic will be notified that we
are alive and want recognition."
President Stone was one time at the
head of the Knightsof Laboron this coast
and recently he wrote the following letter
to James 11. Sovereign, the successor of
Powderly :
San Francisco, April 5. 1897.
James R. Sovereign, General Master Workman
Knights oj Laborâ My Dear Sik and Brother:
J inclose Herewith a circular of ourLincoiii

call your attention.
You will see that we are working on a seem
ingly double line. We are laboring to raise
fands for a suitable monument to Abraham
Lincoln, to be erected in our grand park hero,
end it is our purpose to establish, it possible
a Lincoln day In the schools of the country.
Instead of turning 'jhildren out into the
streets on a legal holiday to fritter their time
away in idle pmy we propose to lighten up the
walls of our schoolhouses and prepare suit
able tongs and recitations ior a Lincoln day
Iv this way we snail be atÂ»le to give the chil
dren an object lesson in history that will
remain impressed on their minds durine
their lifetime.
You will be Able to assist na very materially
in this enterprise. From my knowledge of
your local assemblies they meet, transact
business in a perfunctory manner and adjourn.
Why not give them somethinn lo do ? Let
them become interested in our Lincoln Monu
ment League; let them appoint committees to
go out and visit schools and schooit achers
and talk about the value <>f patriotic instruc
tion; have thi.-m tnke hold oj' Lincoln day and
Liucoln monument and tney will have an ob
jective point that will iight up their meetings
and infuse new life into the order.

and I submit it to your careful consideration.

Leagueâ Dear Sir and comrade: Your letter
of April 7 received. 1 fully agree with you in
regard to a Lincoln day in schools, but I do
not altogether agree with your opinion as to
the date. It might be well this year to observe
the 28th day of Mar fora Lincoln monument
day. but I should much prefer, if such a day
is established, that ii should be either Febru
ary 12 or April 14. The reasons are obvious.
The school On!. iron of Indianapolis have
furnished the flowers for Memorial day for a
number of years, and I think it is almost a
general practice throughout the State and the
country. One of the lundamental principle*
of the Woman's Relief Corps is to inculcate
lessons of patriotism and love of country
among our children. By a resolution passed
in the National Convention in 1893 an active
crusade on that line was begun. You will now
find almost every corps at work introducing
patriotic anlutas, patriotic primers and charts
into our pnb.ic schools.
Hoping that you will meet with the greatest

The Grand Lodge of the Knishts and
Ladies of Honor convened in annual ses

Ttiere was a full representation from all
the lodges of the jurisdiction, and all the
grand officers were in attendance.
The morning session was taken up in
the examination of the credentials of the
representatives and the conferring of the
grand lodge fiegree on a dozen candidates
entitled to receive the same.
At the afternoon session the reports of
the grand protector, grand secretary,
grand treasurer and the finance committee
were presented and referred to a commit
tee consisting of H. W. Quitzow, T. H.
Berkey and Mrs. E. R. O'Donnell.
The grand secretary was instructed to
send a message of greeting to Supreme
Secretary Lock hard t at Bradford, Pa.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
Supreme Lodge to confer the degree of
Orand Past Protector on E. Bourguignon
of San Jose, in recognition of many services
rendered the order in a number of years
past.
George J. Vincent tendered his resigna

to enable him to become a candidate for
the ofhee of supreme representative.
A document setting forth tbn fact that
Grand Secretary 8. B. Carieton has for
ten years furnisued office-room to the or

visits to the lodges in behalf of the order
at his own expense, and has at his own
request bad his salary reduced, was read,
and thereupon a resolution of grateful
thanks, signed by every member of the
Grand Ljdge, was presented to the grand
secretary, who modestly expressed bis
appreciation of i' c honor.
Matters that come under the head of
secret work were brought up during the
afternoon and the lodge then adjourned
to meet this morning, when the election
for officers will take place. Mrs. Belle W.
Conrad will not have an opponent for the
office of :Taii'i protector. S. Conradi of
Los Angeles is a prominent candidate for
the office of grand vice-Drotector. Grand
Secretary Carieton, who has held the
office for ten years, will not be a candidate
if any one is named tor the office.
George J. Vincent will be a candidate
for supreme representative, as will also

WOMEN! DON'T WAIT.
If Yoa 3ave Any of These Symp-
toms Act at Once.
Do you know the reason why you will
to to the hospital, my poor friend?
Because you have allowed yourself
to gro from bad to worse. You did not
know that that heat, swelling- and ten-
ierness in your left side were all signs
ot congestion of the ovary.
Any intelligent woman could have
told you that congestion is fatal to the
you will have
to undergo the operation of ovariotomy,
the cutting out of the ovary.
Yes, you will recover, at least I hope
you will; but you will never be quite
the same woman again. Congestion of
the ovaries is fatal to health. If you
have any such symptoms be advised
in time ; take a medicine of specific
powers'. You can find none better
than Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, prepared especially to meet
the needs of woman's sexual system.
You can get it at any good druggist's.
Following we publish a letter from
a woman in Milwaukee, which relates-
how she was cured of ovarian trouble :
" Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I suffered with
congestion of the ovaries and inflamma
tion of the womb. I had been troubled
with suppressed and painful menstrua
tion from a girl. The doctors told mi
the ovaries would have to be removed
I took treatment two years to escapt
an operation, but still remained in mis
erable health in both body and mind, ex
pecting to part with my reason eacL
coming month. After using one bottle
of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com
pound and a package of Sanative Was];
I was very much relieved. I continued
to use your remedies until cured. Tht
last nine months have beon passed ii
perfect good health. This, I know, I owe
entirely to the Vegetable Compound
My gratitude is great, indeed, to tht
one to whom so many women owe then
health and happiness." â Mbs. F. M
