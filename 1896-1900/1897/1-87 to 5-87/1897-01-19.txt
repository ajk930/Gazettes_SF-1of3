SACRAMENTO, Cat,., Jan. 18. â The
Committees on Labor of the Senate and
the AsseniDly held a session lasting until
after midnight in hearing ihe arguments
for and against Ass< rubty bill 150, regu
latinc employment agents.
Section 1 of the act provides that tbe
employment office fee must be immedi
ately returned to the applicant upon his
failure to secure employment or upon his
being proved to De incompetent, unfitted
or unsuitea for said employment. No fee
8ba!l he charged ir. excess of 5 per cent of
the lirst month's wajjes of the applicant
and in no case shall it exceed 5 per cent o'
the wages earned by the applicant during
any time less than one month. Section 5
reaus as follows:
It shall be unlawful for any employment
Bgent to Insert an advertisement in any nnvi
paper, or in any other manner advertise for
help of afcy kind, unless the said advertising
is done in pur-uuni uf actual bona li Jc orders
lor help which shall have been rece'vert by the
said agent. The Commissioner of the Depart
ment of Labor may at any time investigate
paid order= in order to satisfy himself of their
authenticity.
Violation of the act is punishable by a
fine of not more than $200 nor less than
$00, or not more than thirty days' impris
onment, or both rine and iniorisonment.
A communication was read, sieved by
fcOQO laboring men anri 23*6 laboring
vomeu, asking the Legislature to pass
tr.e bin.
A protest was read from Los Angeles,
netting forth that a free employment
bureau would be an unnecessary tax upon
the people, and statins; that a free em
ployment bureau in Los Angeles had
proved to be a lailure. Reference was also
made to the free employment bureau
Btaried in San Francisco a few years ago
and whicn collapsed and was never more
heard from.
Mr. Morgenstern and Goare A. Went
â¢worth appeared on behalf of the prote-t
--ants and Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
and his assistant (Mr. Dam), and air.
Arthur appeared for the bill.
The chairman of the lommittee decided
that the negative proposition or tue op
ponents of the bill should open the dis-
cussion. Mr. Morgentern began by argu
ing that middlemen were necessary in
business where there was a demand on
onesideand a supply on the other. Being
necessary they were legitimate so lons as
they transacted their bu-iness honestly.
It it is true that this is a iopnimate bnsiness
and the laws are sufficient to punish dis
honesty in it, what need is there, he asked,
of burdening the already overburdened
codes with an additional law on the sub
ject. Taking up the first section, the
speaker asked when it became necessary
to make a law to declare illegitimate
a business which has been held to be le^al
ever since its birth. The attempt to regu
late a business which is perfectly legiti
mate, and which does not admit of being
interfered With, is clearly unconstitu
tional.
Senator Morehouse asked Mr. Morgen
stern his grounds for declaring the first
sec Lion unconstitutional, and Mr. Mor
gen=tern replied that in a case where a
man engaged a lawyer and paid him $200
to win a case for him, there could be no
| law to compel the lawyer to refund to the
J -it the fee.
* What would you say of a man going
xo an employment agent and representing
himself to be competent for a certain po
sition, while, at the sams time he was
lying to the a^ent. Then when that man
goes to work he is found to be totally in
competent an<l is discharged on the sec
ond day, do you think tUat the agent
should not be paid for his trouble, when
it was no fault of his that the applicant
was found to be incompetent?" asked Mr.
Morgenstern.
Assemblyman Mahoney of the commit
tee asked whether the agent could not
Bend a man to an employer on irial for
two or three days, and Mr. Morgenstern
replied that that could be done, but that
supposing that the agent should have to
Bend five men one after another to the
same place in vain the agent would have
done five times the amount of work for
nothing.
The speaker added that ther* was not a
reputable employment agent in the State
opposed to section five which prohibited
fake advertising. They would do all in
their power to have that section made a
law, because it would protect all reputa
ble acents in their business.
The next sections were objected to by
Mr. Morgenbtern. They are as follows:
Sec. 4. Every employment agent shall in
connection with his business -keep a book, or
1 i-et of books, showing the number of applica
tions for employment made to said emDloy
â inent agent, the number of applicants
' by him to employers, the number
of applicants for whom employment has
been secured by Raid employment
agent, the amount of fees and commissions,
and the character and value of any other
property taken by said employment agent in
return for securing employment for ap
plicants, and the amount of money
and the character and value of other
The San Francisco Call
property returned to applicants who
have tailed to obtain employment; and
every employment agent shall upon the first
day of each month furnish to the Commis
sioner of the Department of Labor a writ
ten statement from said book or set of books
plainly setting forth said facts upon a blank
form to be furnished by said Commissioner.
Bee. 7. 1 lie Commissioner of thÂ« Depart
ment of Labor shall, during business hours,
have free access to all offices used by any em
ployment agent or agents, and shall be per
mitted to post therein copies of any laws or
notices concerning the conduct of the busi
ness of the said employment agent or other
information corcerning labor. The said copies
of laws or notices shall be conspicuously
posted and shall not be hidden, removed or
defaced.
"This act would allow the Labor Com
missioner to walk into any employment
office and post up a notice asking for 500
men for certain wotk which they could
have by applying to him," added the
speaker. "The effect of the law, in
connection with another bill before the
Assembly, would be to erect a throne in
the State Capitol and seat upon it La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald as a king."
The speaker called attention to the
power and influence that would be wielded
by the Labor Commissioner if employ
ment agents were driven out of business
by the law. The bill gave the Labor Com
missioner too mucn power and influence.
It was a parly measure, be argued.
"It may be good politics, but it is not
good morals or common sense. This bill
would throw all persons seeking employ
ment into toe hands of one man, and it
would be conferring upon him a greater
power than that possessed by the Gov
ernor of this State or the President of the
United States," Â»aid the speaker.
Senator Morehouse said that the bill
had been framed for the purpose of doing
away with a serious evil like that which
happened a short time ago, when 500 men,
in answer to an advertisement, went to
Fresno and found that they had been
duped. The speaker calied attention to a
bill prepared by employment agents and
already read in the Assembly requiring of
all agents a penal bond in the sum of
$5000.
Mr. McArthar followed for the Labor
Commissioner and ihe workingmen and
repudiated the idea that there was any or
ganization behind the bill except the or
uanizsd workingmen of the State. With
reference to Mr. Morganstern's contention
that the bill was unconstitutional Mr. Mc-
Arthur argued that it was a man's consti
tutional right to earn his daily bread, and
that whoever attempted to preven: a man
from getting employment violated that
man's constitutional right.
The Speaker read from the Revised
Statutes of the United States the law pro
hibiting any one except a shipping com
missioner from receiving or demanding a
fee irom a seaman for obtaining employ
ment for him. Here the United States
had legislated against the right of a sea
man, to make a contract, because he is
usually without resources or mends, and
the Federal Government steps in to sive
him from the exactions of the crimps.
If the Federal Government has a right
to legislate against the seamen making a
contract, why should not the State have a
right to legislate on beha.'f of tbe working
ruen, be asked. No reputable employ
ment agent should object to the bill. Its
object was to protect the working people
irom being swindled by dishonest agents.
It baa happened too often that an em
ployment a^ent has sent an applicant to
â work in the country. This applicant has
paid the agent two or three dollars. At
the end of two or three days the man is
discharged ant the agent sends another
man who has paid two or three dollars,
and so on as long as the game will last,
the employer and the agent dividing the
money received from the victims.
"There is only one clause in the bill,"
continued Mr. McArthur, â¢'that the em
ployment agents object to and that is the
5 per cent clause, but 5 per cent is a pretty
good fee. It is a matter of notoriety that
employment agents as a class are swin
dlers, that they trade upon the necessities
of the poor; in many instances they
take money and don't give any return for
it, and when they do give a return in
most instances it is inadequate. If this
law will not permit employment agents to
do business in their own way let them give
up the bu-iness and go to work at some
thing else. Mnssachusetts has a similar
law and it was working well."
Mr. McArthur closed by saying that the
problem of the day was to put men and
women to work.
K. M. Fitzgerald, brother of the Labor
Commissioner, iollowed on behalf of the
bill. He recalled the time when, two
years ago, an effort was made in the Legis
lature to abolish the Labor Bureau, and
he had had considerable difficulty in con
vincing the legislators that if the bureau
wa- properly conducted it would be of
much pood to workingmen and women.
Mr. Fitzgerald read the deposition oi
Robert H. Murray, stating that while act
ing as employment agent he bad paid to
Hogan & Burns, contractors, to B. Galla
gher, foreman of the stone quarry at No
vato, and to Mr. Carey of Harbor View 50
cents for each person furnished them by
Murray. This was a common practice
among employment agents, added Mr.
Murray's deposition.
Mr. Fitzgerald read several instances in
which Charles Miller's ranch at Livei
raore figured in ihe advertisement, and to
which poor men had been sent by un
scrupulous agents only to find thst they
had been duped out of the fees paid by
them to the agents. The speaker went on
to show that the State, which fixed the
fees of doctors, the rate? of car fare, and
so forth, could also fix the fees and com
missions of employment agents.
California was not the first or the only
State to legislate against dishonest em
ployment aÃents or to establish free
public employment offices. He
showed by official reports that
wherever public offices were established
the private employment offices ceased to
exist. There was nothing in the bill, he
said, to which an honest employment
agent could object. There was only one
thing.and that was the 5 per cent commis
sion, but that was large enough fee for a
person doing an honest business.
In answer to a question by Senator
Morehouse, Mr. Fi'zgerald said that it
was the practice of dishonest agents to
conspire with employers to discharge
men for incompetency, when, in fact, the
men were competent. For thai reason
the clause was inserted in the first section
requiring the agent to surrender the fee
when the applicant was discharged for in
competency.
Senator Morehouse asked would not an
injustice be done an honest agent where
an applicant had made false statements
as to his competency and where the em
ployer had discharged him for in-
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 19, 1897.
WHO IS LABOR'S FRIEND?
The organized Labor of this City and the unorganized as well learned with surprise
yesterday morning that The Call had been denounced at a public meeting as their
foe. The denunciation appeared in the Examiner, in what purported to be a report
of the action of some workingmen and women not connected with the Labor Council,
who met in a hall on Turk street. It appears that these people, without making any
investigation, censured The Call for opposing Commissioner Fitzgerald's labor bureau
bill, which it has not done, and passed resolutions in accordance with the alleged facts.
It might be a difficult matter to show that one who opposes Mr. Fitzgerald's plan is an
enemy of labor, but The Call has not opposed it. It has given both sides of the
matter and will continue to do so. A significant and a suspicious fact is that the
only press representatives at this meeting on Turk streefwere a reporter and an artist
of the Examiner. '
How this uncalled for and unwarranted denunciation of The Call by people
who must have been deceived is regarded by those who must know the facts is
shown by the following record of a meeting held by The Call 1 Chapel last night.
CHARLES M. SHORTRIDGE, Editor and Proprietor SAN FRANCISCO CALL :
DEAR SIR:
At a meeting of The Call Chapel, held on the evening of Monday, January 18, 1897. the following
preamble, resolution and statement of facts were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, There has been made what we consider an unjustifiable attack upon the paper by which
we are employed, and an attempt has been made to place it in the position of an enemy to labor; and
Whereas, Any such attempt to mislead the public may convey the impression that we are work
ing for an unfair paper, we deem it our duty, as employes of said paper, to lay the true facts before the
reading public that it may judge for itself who is the real friend of labor; therefore, by the San Fran
cisco Call Chapel, in meeting assembled, it is
Resolved, That we have perfect confidence in the SAN FRANCISCO CALL under its present
management as an ally of labor; and while we have no differences with any organization or individuals,'
we most emphatically deny any assertion to the effect that THE CALL is other than a true friend of
labor, and most respectfully submit the following facts that the public may be able to determine how
our employer treats his employes.
Since Mr. Shortridge became the proprietor of THE CALL the composing-room has been enlarged,
greatly to the comfort and convenience of the workmen; incandescent electric lights have taken the
place of foul-smelling coal-oil lamps, and the office has been â¢ otherwise improved in a sanitary way,
much to the benefit of those who are compelled to labor in it at night; and all this without any solici
tation on our part.
The following statement of wages paid the employes of THE CALL in the composing-room for the
year 1894, before Mr. Shortridge assumed control, and for the years 1895 and 1896, during his pro
prietorship, is convincing argument as to his position on the labor question :
1894 - - -â¢ - - - - - - â¢ $ 80,143 10
1895 106,115 95
1896 116,764 00
All of which sums have been paid .in wages to compositors, payments being made each Monday after
noon, and the money has been put in circulation in the City and County of San Francisco.
Not only is the full scale of prices established by the San Francisco Typographical Union for
labor paid in all departments of .THE CALL composing-room, but in many instances faithful and re
liable employes are voluntarily paid wages considerably in advance of those called for by the
schedule, or to which under the laws of their governing body they are legally entitled. .
Almost at the introduction of ; Mr. ; ' Shortridge to San : Francisco journalism .the publishers of , the
other dailies of this City resorted to the employment of labor-saving machinery (typesetting machines),
thus reducing the expense of running their composing-rooms alone from $10,000 to $25,000 a year at the
direct expense of labor, and that, too, without the necessity of competition as an incentive for seeking
â  such relief to the utter demoralization of human effort.
With two-thirds of the hand-compositors being displaced in all the other daily papers of this City
by machinery, and seeing our elderly brother typos robbed completely of their means of living at a
period of life too late to commence the acquirement of another trade, it took but little to induce the pro
prietor of THE CALL to postpone resorting to the same method of retrenchment, and thus was saved
to the hand-compositors the only large daily newspaper in the City of San Francisco, and we may say
in the United States.
In our opinion the best evidence of a man's future intentions can be determined by what he has
done for labor in the past and what he is doing at the present time.
Signed by committee, C. M. JONES, Chairman,
D. G. POOLE,
A. C. SCHWATKA,
W. G. SMITH, Father of the Chapel,
H. L. BRADLEY, Secretary.
Here are a few facts that will be read with interest by workingmen, by storekeepers and all
who are interested in keeping our own men and women employed and in keeping San Francisco money
in San Francisco. THE CALL, as will be seen from the subjoined list, employs 140 men and women
in its composing-room. The Examiner, which poses as the friend of labor, employs 64, the Chronicle
41, the Bulletin 13, the Report 15, and the Post 13. Thus it appears that/the Chronicle and Examiner
together employ 105 compositors, just 35 less than THE CALL. It will also be seen that the Chroni
cle, Examiner, Bulletin, Post and Report combined employ but 146 compositors, or only six more than
THE CALL employs. The list below given is official, and is taken from the current number of the
Pacific Union Printer. *

Competency it the agent were re
quired to return tne fee, Mr. Fitzgerald
replied that in that case an injustice
might be done to the agent, but that
no law on any subject could be framed
that wouia not injure somebody. He
added as an instance of dishonesty that
one emrloyment tirm in San Francisco
sent 8000 men to the Guadalupe Railroad
section near San Jose to do work that
could be done by 600 men. His informant
was Mr. Hood of the Southern Pacific
Company, he said.
He added thai be had been informed that
in yesterday's issue of a newspaper was
an advertisement from one firm calling
tor 600 men, when in fact he did not be
lieve that the employment agency had
places for sixty.
Mr. Morgenstern closed the argument
by reiterating his statement that ihe bill
was a Democratic job. If it was not for
political capital why did those niass
meetings pass resolutions that it was not
for political effect.
Mr. Fitzgerald replied that the resolu
tion was passed became Employment
Agent Ready had stated six months ago
that the resolution was for political effect.
Mr. Morgenstern argued that the object of
the bill to establish a free labor bureau
was to drive all employment agents out
of the business The Labor Commissionet
would be a competitor in business.
Senator Morehouse called attention toa
clause requiring the Labor Commissioner
to keep secret the information be might
gain from his inspection of the books of
employment agents. He did noi believe
that the Legislature had a right to pass a
law fixing fees or compensation so low
that the a.ents could not make a living.
He did not know whether 5 per cent was
a sufficient or an insufficient compensa
tion for the employment agent. If the
agent had to advertise or look abuut to
find a suitable man he did not think that
5 per cent was s reasonable compensation.
Agent Hansen was asked to describe to
the committee the manner in which he
transacted his business in the matter of
furnishing help to employers. Mr. Han
sen told of the labor involved, of the ad
vertising expenses, of the correspondence
with employers and of the other details
that take up the time of the employment
agent.
"Suppose that I wanted a skilled type
writer in my office, how would you set
about getting me one?" asked Senator
Morehouae.
Mr. Hansen explained that he kept a
register of applicants, with the length of
their experience and their capacity, their
references, etc. For this no charge was
made. The charge ior getting a position
was 10 per cent for a position of that kind.
There were other places for which only 5
per cent was charged.
Mr. Hansen said that he averaged 400 or
nOO men per month. He had four persons
in his office assisting him in the business.
In the majorfty of cases where a man was
earning $20 a month he did not charge 10
per cent; he took $1 or $1 50. or 50 cents.
He considered that the bill was an in
fringement on his constitutional rights
and Raid -that if it became a law he would
close his door and take his name off it.
Mr. Murray next made a statement. He
made charges against Uansen and other
agents and created much lacgbtcr. The
committee then went into executive ses
sion at 12:35 A. m.
The committee at 1:15 A. m. decided to
recommend the passage of the bill with
some slight amendments in the wording.
LOCAL LABOR VIEWS.
Commissioner Fitzgerald Favored
as a Champion of Socialism.
Most of the local trade union leaders
favor the Fitzgerald bill in a general way.
because they regard it as a step toward
socialism, and they are anxious to stop
the abuses that have existed among cer
tain labor bureaus in the past.
Theodore Lynch, speaking of the mat
ter, said : "Fitzgerald and his crowd
might make political capital of the affair,
but it is a step in the right direction any
how â a movement toward pure socialism
âand it is such a millennium that all true
friends of labor hail with joy.
"Those who denounced The Call, how
ever, made a wild leap in the dark, lor
The Call simply gave the news of what
the employment agents were doing; gave
their speeches and contemplated move
ments, thus patting us in possession of
real information."
Labor Agent Ready said: "This is a
scheme of the Examiner to get our advertis
ing away from The Call. The Examiner
sent as an agent named A. P. Sinclair, in
troduced by tbeir Mr. A. Atkins, and be
agreed to give us a page to fight Fi:zger
ald and to aid us if we would take our ad
vertising away from The Call. When
we refused to accede to iheir terms they
began to work on the labor unions."
P. Ross Martin said: "Bills similar to
Fitzgerald's have been adopted elsewhere.
They are one step toward socialism, and
socialists welcome them."
John W. Alexander, carpenter and labor
orator, said: "I am opposed to Fitzgerald
and his bill. It is only a political scheme
and it will cut many a workingman out of
a job. None but the Commissioner's
political friends can ever expect any
favors if you once wipe out private indus
try in the agency line. It is a delusion to
imagine that any political scheme of this
kind is a move toward socialism. It is
only a plan to give fat jobs to a lot of ex
haberdashers and political bums now in
politics."
Sam McKee of the Ironmolders' Union
does not take much stock in the State

may have. He said: "I do not see what
particular good this bureau is as it has
been conducted in the past. It was cre
ated for the laboring classes, but it has
been converted iiito a soft snap for politi

in the past have been taken from the
daily newspapers, and as a rule the Labor
Commissioners have published reports
of labor matters to suit the employing

best known to themselves and the Com

annual Reports just such matter as best
suited themselves and without regard to
facts. This Free State Employment

increase of good places for the pol itical

BIG TORPEDOES PLANTED IN

While the Shipwrecked Crew An
Struggling in the Water They
Are Fired Upon.
HAVANA, Ccba. Jan. 18.â Though the
insurgents have no navy, they do not hes
itate when the opportunity offers to attack
the Spanish warships. The latest instance
of this kind occurred yesterday morning,
when a Spanish warboat was sunk by an
explosion of a torpedo and many of her
occupants were iost.
The rebels had made an attack on
Guama, some distance up the river, in the
Province of Santiago de Cuba, and the
Cuban trooparfearing that they wouhl not
be able to hold it asked for assistance from
Manzanillo, on the coast. Saturday night
the gunboats Centeneli and Relampago
left Manzanillo under orders to ascend
the river and protect the forts.
The commander of the gunboats made
all possible speed in running up the river,
but when they began to ascend the stream
ttiey proceeded very cautiously, susptctiug
the rebels might have planted torpedoes in
the channel.
All went well until the gunboats were
opposite a place called Mango, when, de
spite all the precautions that had been
taken, the Relampago struck a -.torpedo.
Instantly there was a terrific explosion
and masses of water were hurled to a
great height. The boat had a hole torn in
her and she immediately began to sink.
Those on board the ship who were not
injure! jumped into the river and made
their way as best they could to Centeneli.
As soon as it was seen what had happened
to the Relampago the Centeneli's boats
were ordered to the rescue. The rebels
appeared to be in strong force on both
sides of the river and when they *aw the
Spaniards in the water they directed a
heavy rifle fire on them.
The Centeneli opened fire, but as their
positions could only be determined by the
smoke from their guns, it is not believert
any serious losses were inflicted upou
them. When the C nteneli's boats went
to the rescue of the men struggling in the
water, the rebels fired upon them, but the
Spaniards bravely proceeded in their work
of rescue until all the men had been
taken from the water.
The commander of the Centeneli was so
seriously wounded that doubts are held as
to hii recovery.
The Centeneli returned to Manzanillo,
where the news of the disaster caused in
tense excitement.
Official reports of the accident say that
the commander, second mate and three
engineers of the Relampago were killed,
and her boatswein, second omcer and four
sailors wounded.
The pilot of the Centeneli was killed in
the pilot-house, and the engineer and
gunner and several sailors wounded.
HORRORS Of WARFARE.
Women Among Those Arrested and Im-
united With Criminal.*.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 18.â The follow
ing Havana news has been received here:
By order of the civil government of Puerto
Principe the following distinguished per
sons have been arrested in this city : Con
cepion Monegrante, widow of General
Sanchez, and mother of Benjamin, Calixto,
Armado, Alfredo and Eugenio Sanchez,
all in the revolution, the latter (Eugenio)
being Gomez' physician; Maria Agnilar,
sister of Antonio ' Aguilar Varona, ex-
Cuban civil Governor of Puerto Principe.
It is also rumored that President Cisueros
and other prominent citizens have been
arrested: also Jose y Liquias, Carlos Adan
y Masvidal, Ramon Bosa y Bosa, Ajjra
monta Bosa, Jose Mora Pera, Vincente
Ramerez y Lerlesma and many others.
The city is terribly excited, not only on
account of these arrests, but also on
account of the suppression of El Pueblo.
Citizens wishing to leave are unable to
do so, the Government prohibiting their
departure. The condition of the jail is
frightful. There are no accommodations
for ladies, and those arrested are confined
with common criminals.
Gomez was last reported at|the rancho
La Camp'ana, near Sancto Spiritus. There
are many rebel movements in that section
and Remedios. Gomez appears to be
making a concentration of rebel forces
preparatory to a formal advance. Tha
Government is rushing troops to that
section and establishing a strong line on
the border of Matanzas and Santa Clara
provinces.
It is said Gomez has given orders to
begin the skirmishing policy and press no
tights with itie troops, but harass them
until the dry season is over. It appears
Gomez will not come to Havana province
yet, knowing he woul'i be caught in a
trap, as this section affords no facilities
to deploy his forces. There are no woods
or hills, and besides it is crossed with too
mnny roads, railroad towns at a short dis
tance, etc. Then, too, Weyler would
throw on Gom'Z 10,000 men Weyler has
in hiding. Gomez knows Weylor's plan
and is too smart to be caught.
The condition of things is becoming
alarming. Smallpox has extended to all
wards of the city and has assumed fright
ful proportions. The death rate is 47 per2
cent. Smallpox has been officially de
clared epidemic.
The censorship is more rigorous than
ever. The publication of all news of the
burning of the cane field, farms, es
tates, etc., known to be occurring in all the
provinces, especially in Havana, is pro
hibited.
The news reaching the city is never
printed. Pre>s censorship is exerted over
the local correspondents, and they are not
allowed to transmit important engage
ments or rebels' movements.
WIN A VICTORY IN COURT.
Cuban Insurgent* Gain a Decision in
the Three Friends Cane.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 1&-The
Cuban insurgents won a decided victory
in the United States court to-day when
Judge Locke rendered a decision in the
case of the United States vs. the steamer
Three Friends. He decided that no state
of war existed and no law had been vio
lated. The libel afsrmed that "the Three
Friends was then and there furnished,
fitted out and armed with one certain gun
or several, the exact number being un
known to the United States attorney, with
ammunition, there to be employed in the
service of certain insurgents or persons in
the island of Cuba, and with the intent to
cruise or commit hostilities against the
subjects, citizens or properiy of the King
of Spain on the island of Cuba." To this
the exception of the respondent's answer
was: "That said libel does not show that
the vessel was so armed or fitted out or so
furnished with the intent thai such vessel
should be employed in the service of any
body politic recognized or known to the
United States as a body politic" ; : ';"
The answer of the libelaut, the United
States Government, to this exception was
that the law as Bet forth in section 5283 of
the Revised Statutes did not require that a
vessel that was subject to condemnation
for violation of the section should be em
ployed by any body recognized by or
known to the United States as a body
politic. The point made by the respondent |
was that the statute contemplated a con- i
dition of war already existing, and that
when no war existed there could be no
violation of the statute. The case was
then suggested as to how the state of war
was to be determined. It could come only
by action of Congress. It was far beyond
the power of the judiciary to determine
the fact. In other words the insurgents
must be recognized as belligerents before
the statute could be violated. The court
sustained the exceptions of the respond
ents and gave the libelants ten days to
file an amended complaint.
If a new libel is not tiled within that
time the $1000 bond is to be canceled and
the vessel released.
LABOR AND THE LAW
Continued from Firtt Page.
body it cares a bit whether the State runs
the employment bureaus or not. These
men go from shop to shop when tht-y
want work, and they never go near
bureaus of any kind. 1 '
W. T. Boyce, for the past year presi
dent of the Ironruolders' Union No. 164.
slated that be is in favor of tbe Fitzgerald
bill for the establishment of free State
employment agencies and said: "These
private employment agencies have been
and are now the worst kind of swindles.
Hardly a day passes but that Eome poor
fellow who can't afford to lose a cent is
ruthlessly robbed by these sharks.
I j"ln many cases these fellows have an !
agreement with some one who employs
large numbers of men. The applicants
for work are charged \fee and s nt to the
confederate, who gives them work for a
day or two and then sends them adrift
without reason, cause or excuse â or
money. Another batch of laborers, who
have paid the employment agent for their
positions, are put to work and they in
turn are sent away.
"And so it goes.one crowd alter another,
until the poor as a whole are made still
poorer, and these robbers reap the unjust
profits and grow rich. It is simply a leÂ»al
manner of robbing men and there is no
redress. Put me down for any chance
that will put a stop to this nefarious sys
tem of stealing from the poor and needy."
L. D. Gardner, president of Carpenters'
and Joiners' Union No. 483, spoke as fol
lows: "The o'd system of conducting
private employment agencirs is simply a
system of robbery under the guise of a
legitimate business. From what I can
learn as many men have been robbed as
benefited by these private employment
agencies.
"Maybe, the new proposed free agencies
or bureaus would be seized upon by the
politicians; but even so, the poor people
could better afford tbe expense or their
support by taxation than to be bunkoed
out of what little they baye when they
need that little the most. As I under
stand it, tbe bill does not propose to ab-
Bolutely abolish j rivate enterprise in this
direction, but it does propose to make the
private employment agents deal honestly
with their patrons and the public, and for
this reason if for no other I hope the bill
will pass."
Joseph Walters, secretary of the Brew
ery Workmen's Union, said: "1 am in
favor of tbe bill. It will practically do
away with these bunko agents, who rob
men by taking tbeir money without giv
ing the equivalent in positions. I would
like to see these private agencies abolished
altogether.
"They are the worst enemy that orga
nized labor has to contend against.
Whenever there is any trouble between
labor and capital these agents step in and
furnish the capitalists with scabs, who
take the places of the men who have quit
work. Ido not believe that a free bureau
would take such a part in case of trouble
between an employer and bis men. I
believe that the State should furnish the
unemployed with the means of making a
living, by bringing employer and laborer
together, free of cost to both.
Guy Latbrop, manager of the* Labor Bu
reau Association at Ololj Market street,
said:
"I am in favor of the Fitzgerald free
employment measure. In Illinois, Ohio,
Minnesota and other Slates the plan has
worked with success. The Governors of
those States have practically placed the
matter out of politics and selected Labor
Commissioners on merit alone.
"These Commissioners have had the
exclusive right to select tneir own assist
ants. The wotk of the bureaus have been
carried on in a systematic and business
like metnod, and great benefits have re
sulted to those who really need assistance.

STATES FUNDS
Evidence That the Wave of
Econcmy Has Struck
the Senate.
Withington Startles Atiaches by
the Introduction of an
Amendment.
It Prcvides f)r a S.ving of Ab ut
$800 a D-.y During the Session
of the Legislature.
SACRAMENTO, Cal , Jan. 18.â There
was evidence to-ilay that the wave of
economy superinduced by the exposure of
extravagance in the preliminary organiza
tion of the Assembly has struck the
Senate. Senator Withingtoo rather
startled that body this tnomina when he
introduced a constitutional amendment
providing as follows:
The officers of the two houses, other than
the president and speaker, shall be a secretary
of the Senate and t'lerlt of thj' Asaenibv and
such assistants as they may appoint, but the
clerical expenses of tne Senate shall not cx
ce t 'd $2Ou per aav fur each session, nor trios:
of the Assembly $200 per day lor oach session.
The secretary of the: Senate and the clerk of
ihe Assembly shall be required to give bond
and security tor the faithiul discharge of their
respective duties.
\v : at this wou-'d mean can be imagined
from the fact that the present daily ex
penses of both houses in the shape of sal
aries of attaches, covered by this proposed
measure, reach nearly $1200, of which $700
is paid by the Assembly. Under the
Withington amendment the total daily
expense for both branches could not ex
ceed $400.
"Tbat's a stem winder, "â¢ ejaculated one
of the clerks after the meaure had been
read. "But it will be smothered iv short
order in committee," he remarked consol
ingly to a fellow-attache, who had not yet
time to recover his breath. And this is
the general impression.
Withington states that he got the idea
of the measure from Speaker Coombs and
Governor Atkinson of Georgia, who was
an honored guest of the Senate to-day.
Senator Wolfe carried the Pesthouse
fii,'ht into the Legislature to-day. At tbe
request of the Ashbuiy Heights and Pan
handle Improvement Club he introduced
the totlowing measure:
Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any per
son or corporation to establish, locate, place
or maintain any hosDital, sanitarium, build
ing or other structure used or intended to be
used lor the reception, care or treatment of
any person or persons afflicted with any con
tagious or infectious disease, in any city,
county or city and county of this State within
3000 feet of any lake, pond, river, creek, ditch
or reservoir, ihe water of which is or may be
used for domestic purposes other than iv said
institution. >"or shall any person or corpora
tion receive, accept or treat any person
afflicted with any contagious oz infectious
disease in any such hospital, sanitarium,
building or other structure which Is within
3000 feet of any lake, pond, river, creek,
ditch or reservoir, the water of which is or
may be used for domestic purposes other than
in said institution.
Sec. 2. Every person and any director,
trustee, officer or agent of any corporation, or
eny person who shall violate section 1 of this
act, shall be. guiliy of a misdemeanor, and
shall be fined in a sum not less than $50 and
uot more than $500, or shall be imprisoned
in the County Jail not less than ten nor more
than 180 days, or by both such fine and im
prisonment ia the discretion of the court.
Sec. 3. This act shall take effect immedi
ately.
If this is passed it will effectually pre
vent the building of the Pesthouse on the
Atmshouse tract. The recent conflict of
authority between the San Francisco
Board of Health and Board of Education
relutive to tho closing of certain schools
alleged to be infected with diphtheria is
sought to be avoided in future by the foi
lowing measure, introduced by Senator
Wolfe:
The Board of Health of every municipality
and of every coun:y in the State shall have the
same powers with respect to the adoption and
passage of ordinances relating to matters of a
sanitary character and to such matters which
affect or relate to the health of such munici
pality or county * * * as are now or may
be hereafter conferred upon the Common
Councilor other covenant; body of such mu
nicipality or the Board of Supervisors oi such
county.
Every violation of any ordinance so adopted
or passed is hereby declared to be a misde
meanor.
In all cases of conflict between the or
dinances ot any board of health and those
of tbe local governing body the latter are
declared to be paramount. t This would
virtually make the boards of health co
ordinate legislative bodies with the local
boards of supervisors, counciimen and
trustees, and would give them valuable
and extended powers for preserving and
protecting tbe public health.
The bill for tbe issuing of bends not to
exceed $1,000,000 for the construction of
tbe seawall southward from Mission
street to Channel was introduced by Braun
hart to-day. To-morrow he will present
an amendment to the county government
act, providing that all county officers hold
office for only two years, instead of four
as at present.

Majority and JHin-rlttt Report* on Chief
Cleric Duckworth'* Conduct.
SACRAMENTO, Cau, Jan. 18.âMa
jority and minority reports on Dryden's
resolution to appoint a special committee
to investigate the acts of Chief Clerk,
Duckworth, were presented in the Assem
bly to-day. Vosburg, on behalf of the
majority, reports the amount actually |
paid without justification of law, except ]
as explained at some length, is $3296 30,
and suggests the immediate passage of a
law to limit the number and pay of em-
ployes.
The minority report, presented by Kee
gan, finds that tbe chief cleric appointed
thirty-nine attaches who were not statu
tory officers and entailed an unnecessary
expense of over $3000, and recommends
the appointment of a committee of three,
with power to administer oaths, to fur
ther investigate the matter.
Both reports were made the special or
der for to-morrow on motion of Dibble.
The Committee on Retrenchment re
ported a resolution forbidding the grant
ing of leave of absence to committees for
t c purpose of visiting institutions. The
Committee on Contested Elections alone
excepted. Referred.
Bills were introduced as follows:
By Jones â To prohibit unauthorized
persons wearing the rosette of the Loyal
Legion.
By Gately â Relative to the propagation
of shrimps.
By Henry â Prohibiting the imposition
of license on Califorr la-tnade articles.
By Bettman â To enable consolidated
cities and counties to use voting
machines.
A recess was taken until 3 P. M.
A bill was reported by the Ways and
Means Committee appropriating $75,000
for the State Printing Office. It was put
upon first reading.
Tbe bill forbidding a county officer act
ing as notary public was recommended
for passage.
Ttie Speaker announced that as Emmons
was absent he would not name a com
mittee to investigate the purchase of fur
niture until his return.
The Senate concurrent resolution on the
Nicaraguan canal was^ taken up under
suspension of the rules and, after dis
cussion, was made a special order for
to-morrow morning.
SENATOR WITHINGTON, Who Is After the Attaches* Salaries
With a Great Big Ax.
Upward of twenty bills were introduced,
among which were four by Caminet:i
making appropriations for th" lone School
of Industry, and others by Dibble to com
pel witnesses to appear under subpena
is^uea by the board of healtn, and by
Sims for the construction of a guberna
torial residence at Sacramento.
The joint rule 3 were adopted and
ordered Drinted.
Caminetti introduced a resolution call
ing for a report from tho Harbor Commis
sioners relative to railroad affairs along
the water front of San Francisco. North
opposed the resolution, which was, how
ever, adopted, but notice of reconsidera
tion was given.
A motion to adjourn was lost and the
third reading of the file was called up.
Treacy's bill providing that $2 per day
shall be the minimum wage raid on all
"public works was the only bill on the file.
It was supported by Tieacy, Dennery and
Shanahan, and opposed by Belshaw, Chy
noweth and Brid^f rd, Chynoweth stating
that the bill would operate disastrously
against irrigation districts.
Bri;ipford offered an amendment ex
empting irrigation vQistricts in counties of
the second class from the operation of the
law. Lost.
Tbe bill was then pas-ed, only nine
votes being recorded against it. Ad
journed.
PASSED IN THE ASSEMBLY.
The Bill Fixing the Hate of Compensa
tion for L<>bor on Public Works.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 18.â The de
bate of the day in the Assembly was on
AssemDly bill 17 fixing the minimum rate
oi compensation for labor on public works
at $2 per day. *
Chynoweth of Anaheim was the first to
object to the third reading and passage of
the bill. He said that it would impose a
very great hardship on poor counties like
Orange and might prevent them from pro
ceeding with public works now under way
because of the additional expense. The
town of Anaheim was putting in an elec
tric light plant, and was paying laborers
$1 50 a day. If that sum were raised
to $2 a day the town would be unable to
go on with the work because the proceeds
of the bonds sold for that purpose would
be inadequate.
Valentine of Los Angeles raised the
point that the bill was inoperative because
no penalty was provided. He favored the
proposed law and suggested an amend
ment that all contracts for public work
should contain a proviso that the work
men should be paid not less than $2 per
day, and that the contracts should be
void if the contractor violated its pro
visions.
Briclgford, Democrat nnd Populist from
Colusa, wanted to'have irrigation districts
and public highways outside of city, ci;y
and county and swamp land districts ex
empted from t-e provisions of the bill.
Treacy of San Francisco, the author of
the bill, replied to the effect that contract
ors in irrigation districts paid their men
$1 50 a (fay and charged them 75 cents a
day for board. Ou Sundays and holidays
when a man did not work he was not al
lowed any pay, but wa-> charged for his
board just the same. In San Francisco
contractors paid their men on.y 90 cents a
day.
Belshaw thought it was a dangerous
precedent to establish. Some man would
next offer a resolution to the effect that a
contractor should pay $10 a thousand
more for his lumber or $2 a thousand
more for his brick.
The bill was finally passed by a vote of
59 ayes to 7 noes. It will now have to run
the gauntlet of the Senate and the Gov
ernor before it can become a law.
AN IRRIGATION SQUABBLE.
Long- Standing fnnfliet Jtrn'tred at a
Joint Committee Meeting.
SACRAMENTO, Cal , Jan. 14.â At a
joint meeting to-night of the Senate and
Assembly Committees on Irrigation it
was decided to bold a similar meeting on
Thursday next at 7 :30 p. m. to hear sug
gestions on the subject of which those
committees have charge. Tne meeting is
to be open, and outsiders will be beard,
but musi present their views in writing.
After this had been determined Dibble
ingenuously asued if there was not some
one present who would like to speak on
tne subject of irrigation. Of course, there
was, and the long-standing conflict be
tween Ihe Wright law advocates and its
opponents was reviewed, to the edification
of a few members and the evident dlsgnst
of the veterans.
T. J. Blake of Modesto was the first to
take advantage of the opportunity to
castieate those who he declared were en
gaged in a "gigantic swindle." He added
that more than $400,000 had already been
expended in the Modesto irrigation dis
trict and the ditch had not yet even been
cut into the district proper; it had not
even reached one of its boundaries. In
the Turlock district, he claimed, $600,000
had been spent without bringing a drop of
water for irrigating purposes into the dis
trict. He charged that the directors who
had charge of the expenditure of these
vast sums of money were elected by means
of what he termed the "floating" vote, an
irresponsible element, which was used to
defeat the wishes of the taxpayers. x
His remarks were supplemented by
those of C. W. Eaton of Modesto. He
stated that the figures of Blake were
wrong, and that $300,000 in Modesto and
$1,200,000 in Turlock would have to be ex
pended before either could expect to get
any benefit from the canals now beipg
constructed under the su ervision of the
respective irrigation distric- directors. He
disavowed any intention of charging de
liberate fraud on any one, but he thought
the directors were not generally men com
petent to handle such vast sums of money,
and lost t eir head?.
One of the most unjust features of tbe
Wright act, he said, wa3 the clause pro
viding only one year for the redemption of
property sold by the irrigation district
directors for taxes. He believed the
Legislature should amend this section so
as to extend the time for redemption, and
that the penalties should be reduced. He
had a bill, which he would present at the
next session of the joint committed on
Thursday.
He afterward explained that his bill
extended the period of redemption to two
years and male the penalty only ten per
cent every six months on tbe amount of
the delinquent tax. The present law
exacts fifty per cent of tbe delinquent tax
and two per cent per month. His pro
posed bill also gives delinquents whose
time of redemption has expired and
whose property is still in the hands of tbe
irrigation district, three months from the
passage of the bill to redeem.
Wright, the author of the act which
bears his name, has announced that be
will appear before the committee on
Thursday. An exciting session is antici
pated, as ti.ere is promised to be some
interesting encounters between the irri
gation district factions, and he is expected
to lead the ti^ht on â¢behalf of his measure.
DIBBLE'S GREAT ENERGY.
By Si* Dreltir* Action Be It the leader
*n tht /Harmltly.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 18. â The
casual victor to the Assembly chamber
cannot fail to be im tressed with the fact
that Judge Henry C. Dibble of San Fran
cisco is the leader of tue Republican ma
jority in that branch of the Legislature.
He is & man of commanding presence, has
a good clear voice and distinct articula
tion and is a worker from Old Troy, for he
works like the proverbial Trojan. Al
though the author ot a large number of
highly important bills and belonging to
some of the most important ct mmittees
of t!ie Assembly, he is never rattled and
no question ot importance comes before
the Assembly that does not find him pre
parea to take an active Dart.
For instance, when a question came up
this afternoon with regard to the hours
during which the two postmistresses of
the Assembly should remain on duty,
Judge Dibble stated that the reason wuy
there wt<re two postmistresses was
they could divide up the time.
"When I became a member of the
Assembly," he said, "I was prepared to
work eighteen hours a day, and I do work
eighteen hours a day." This statement is
absolutely true. There is no harder
worker on the floor than Judge Dibble.
Judge Dibble has remarkable energy.
Nothing of importance seems to escape
his attention. He is often on his feet, not
to make windy speeches, as many of his
Democratic colleagues do, but to make
motions, all of which are designed to save
time and prevent confusion. The Judge
is specially active when the interests of
San Francisco are at stake. He took the
leading part to-day in a discussion on a
Senate joint resolution regarding the
early completion of the Nicaragua canal.
The canal, he said, would bring San Fran
cisco 3000 miles nearer to Europe than the
present route by way of Cape Horn.
"The canal," he said, "will make San
Francisco the greatest seaport of the
world. It will bring to San Francisco the
commerce of Asia. It will make this
State the proudest seaboard on the globe
in the course of time.. There should be
no hesitation en the part of the- Legisla
ture to indorse the measure."
On Judge Dibble's motion the matter
was made the special order for to-morrow
morning.
BATES' BIG DREDGER.
Great Jtesults Clairwd. for this Wonder-
ful .Itachin*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 18.â If the
claims of Mr. Bates, inventor, are correct,
his dredger is one of the most useful and
wonderful machines in the country. It
will work a revolutionary era in farming,
hydraulic mining and river navi.ation,
and will relieve Californians dwelling
along river bottoms of an enormous ex
pense incurred in building mammoth
Jevees. The claim made is that the
dredger can make a channel forty feet
wide and twenty feet deep at the rate of a
foot a minute. The greatest capacity of
the best and largest dredger in the State
is 3000 cubic feet in tweuty-four hours,
while that of the Bates dredger is 6000
cubic yards in one hour.
Judson C. Brusie, clerk of the Commis
sioner ot Public Works, predicts wonder
ful things for the new dredger, and \s
working for the passage of a bill appropri
ating $300,000 for the purchase and opera
tion of one of the Bates dredgers, to be
used on the Sacramento and other rivers.
The shoaling of the Sacramento by reason
of crevasses and sluggish currents has
tilled up the bed of the stream so much
that in certain low locations farmers have
built levees 100 feet wide at the base, forty
feet wide at the top and fifty leet high.
Even these are beginning to be unsafe,
and the time has come when the sandbars
and shoals must be removed and the cre
vasses closed.
Mr. Brusie says that civil engineers are
unanimous in the opinion that the re
moval of the Newton Shoals will remove
the evil. The shoals are near Rio Vista
and not far trom the mouths of the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers. Here the
river is about 2000 leet wide and only two
feet deep. In 1854 the depth was eignt
feet and it has been gradually filling up
ever sine. By deepening the river at this
point to about six feet and by narrowing
it to the average width of the stream it
will by increasing the speed of the cur
rent clean itself out and deepen the chan
nel, thus preventing breaks and overflow?.
With the Bates dredger this work could
be done very cheaply and ezpeditiously
and would relieve farmers of the vast bur
den of expense in building and maintain
levet's, the cost of which has ranged as
high as an average of $30 per acre in ma*iy
localities.
The miners will be benefited by the
dredger also, for the deepening of the
channel will so increase the speed of the
current that the silt escaping from the re
straining dams in the hydraulic and min
ing regions will be carried away by the
stream.
The bill provides that the dredger shall
be built in this State. '
TO REDUCE STREETCAR FARES.
Braunhart'.t Bill Before thÂ« Senate Com
mittre on Corporation*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 18.â At the
meeting of the Senate Committee on Cor
porations this afternoon among the im
portant measures that were under consid
eration was the bill reducing streetcar
fares to 2\i < ents between the hours of 6
a. M. and 8 a. m. and 5 p. M. to 7 p. m.
It is contended by some of the members
of the committee that such an act if
passed would work an injustice to the
smaller cities, but the author of the bill
declined to accede to any propositi n ex
empting any cities or towns from tne oper
ation of the measure. He argued that the
privilege of a franchise should at least be
worth this much of a concession to any
streetcar line. Action was deferred until
Thursday.
For the Affi iated Colleges.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 18.â At the
meeting of the Senate Finance Committee
to-day the sum of $125,000 was reappro
priated for the Affiliated Colleges. This
amount was appropriated by the last
Legislature, but had lapsed.

AND CIVIC HONORS
Impressive Funeral of the
Late Minister Willis
at Honolulu.
Blue Jackets and Marines Joined
National Guardsmen in
the Precession.
It Was the Most Elaborate Manifes
tation of Mourning Sinci the
Death of Kalakaua.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Jan. 11.â The
funeral of the iaie Albert S. "Willis on
Friday attcrnoon last was the most elabo
rate event of the kind that, has occurred in
Hawaii since the death of Kalakaua. All
the Government buildings were closed for
the day a* well as all the courts and with
very few exceptions all the business
houses. Flags were at half mast all over
the city and on the shipping in the har
bor, the Stars and Stripes predominating
to a great extent.
Up to the time of the removal of the
body from the residence a corporal and
Jour marines from the Onited States
steamship Alert stood guard over the re
mains, together with representatives from
the Foreign Office detailed tor the purpose.
At nooti on Friday the body was taken
to the Executive building, escorted by
marines from the Alert, the coffin being
completely hidden in the folds of a large
American flag. The handsome coffin was
trimmed wita velvet and richly mounted
in silver. A guard of honor from Com
pany E of the garrison troops, unaer the
command of Captain Coyne, bore the
coffin to the building, while the rest of tne
garrison was lined up at the entrance.
The coffin was laid upon a bier in the
middle of the main assembly hall, form
erly the throne room of the monarchy.
The position was the same as that occu
pied by the body of King Kalakaua when
lying in state.
The body was dressed in a black mourn
ing suit, the face of the dead Minister be
ing revealed beneath a glass lid. It
looked exceedingly natural. There was a
peaceful expression on the face, as of
sweet sleep. At the head of the coffin
stood Colonel Soper and Major lalKe, of
the President's staff and representing him,
while at the foot were Captain's Asnley
and Garten berg of the field staff, a guard
of honor from the regulars being ranged
on either side. Major Potter and A. St.
M. Mackintosh of the Foreign Office and
E. R. Stackable of the Finance Office rep
resented the Cabnet Ministers.
Upon the guard of honor being estab
lished the public were admitted, and filed
slowly around the coffin, pausing at the
.head to take a last look at the honored
countenance. Besides prominent men of
public and private affairs, the visitors in
cluded many workingmen, who took ad
vantage of thÂ« noon lioar to pay tneir
respects to the memory of the distin
guished American representative.
About the base of the bier and lying
upon the coffin were numerous floral
tokens from all classes of society. Promi
nent among the senders of these loving
tributes were British Commissioner
Ha'wes, the Foreign Office, Mrs. W. G.
Irwin, Mrs. H. A. Widemann, Mrs. F. W.
Macfarlane. Mrs. W. O. Smith, Mrs. Dil
lingham, the Misses Afong, the Justices
of the Supreme Court, Pacific Tennis Club,
Mystic Lodge, K. of P. ; Mr. and Mrs. S.
M. Damon, Mr. and ilrs. Ellis Miln and
a host of others. Miss Dulaney, sister of
Mrs. Willis, sent a beautiful anchor of
roses; the Christian Church a basket of
purple and white asters; President and
Mrs. Dole a large basket of white flowers;
the Hui Aloha Aina, a native patriotic
organization, royal palm flowers, the
floral offerings being numbered by the
hundreds. There never has been a time
In the history of this land of flowers and
sunshine when Honolulu has been so
completely denuded of flowers as at the
present time and never a funeral in the
history of the country when they were so
freely used.
At 2:30 o'clock the starboard watch of
the Alert landed and marched to the rear
of the Executive building. A portion of
this battalion was detailed as body
bearers, and at 2:45 received the casket
from the guard of honor in the building
and conveyed it to the hearse at the rear
Btairs. From tbere the remains were
taken to the Central Union Church, a few
blocks away, under escort of battalions
from the Alert and the Guard of
Hawaii.
Long before the hour set for the service
the church was crowded, many hundreds
of natives being assembled outside and in
the building. When the funeral proces
sion arrived there was not standing room
in the big cburch and a vast crowd
thronged the vicinity.
The procession slowly wended its way
along the aisle, Rev. James M. Monroe of
the Christian Church, under whose minis
trations the dead minister bad sat so often,
read from the Scriptures the solemn words
beginning wiih "I am the resurrection
and the life."
The casket was placed just in front of
the pulpit, the pall- bearers occupying the
nearest pew. They were M. Louis Vossion,
Consul and Commissioner of France; F.
A. Scbaefer, Consul for Italy and dean of
the consular corps; Commander F. Han
ford, United States steamship Alert;
Hon. S. M. Damon, Hawaiian Minister of
finance; A. de S. Canavarro, Charge
d'Affaires and Con&ul-General for Portu
gal; A. G. S. Hawes, Her Britannic Ma
jesty's Commissioner; Japanese Consul-
General and Diplomatic Agent Snimamura
and W. Porter Boyd, Vice- Consul for the
United States.
Immediately following the remains
came Mrs. Willis, supported by Ellis
Mills (the United States Consul-General
and Charge d 1 Affaires), Albert Willis (the
only son of the deceased), and Miss
Dulaney (sister of Mrs. Willis) and a
number of their immediate friends.
After the reading of the Scriptures a
select quartet from the church choir sane
"Peace, Perfect Peace." Rev. D. P.
JJirnie, pastor of the church, who assisted
in the services, read another selection
from the Bible, being followed by the
singing of "Abide With Me" by Miss
Grace Richards. Mr. Monroe offered up
an earnest prayer, and Miss Kate McGrew
Bang the beautiful solo from Handel,
"Augels Ever Bright and Fair." The
Lord's Drayer was then repeated by the
entire congregation, led by Mr. Birnie,
the quartet sang "Lead, Kindly Lijht,"
the benediction was pronounced and the
services were over. At the express re
quest of Mrs. Willis no sermon or eulogy
was delivered. The hymns and solos sunn
were selected by her and were old favor
ites of her late husband.
The church was boautifully decorated
with flowers, ferns, palms and potted
plants, the American nag being con
spicuous on either side of the organ. Im
mense palm leaves ran up from the sides
of the choir, the railing of which was com
pletely hidden by masses of cut flowers
and ferns. The many floral offerings were
disposed about the pulpit platform and
in front thereof.
At the conclusion of the services in the
church a platoon of police marched up to
the doors and led the way for the proces
sion. They were followed by the Govern
ment baud of twenty-eight pieces. Then
came the grand marshal, Colonel McLean,
and the following staff all mounted: Cap
tain Bhaefer, chiel aid; Lieutenant-Col
onel J. H. Fisher, Major C. B. Cooper,
Captain W. G. Ashley, Captain J. M. Ca
maraand Captain E. O. White. Follow
ing them came the entire First Regiment
of the National Guard of Hawaii under
the command of Major McLeod and the
battalion from the Alert. The pallbearers,
in carriages, came next, the hearse follow
ing and the body-bearers. The officiating
clergymen, family of the deceased, at
tending physicians and chief mourners
came next. Following were President
Dole and his aid, Major Potter, Hon.
Henery E. Cooper, Minister of Foreign
Affairs and the Chief Justice of the Su
preme Court, Circuit and District Court
Judses, Senators and Representatives,
Captain Hanford and officers of the Alert
and all the members of tne consular corps
and foreign diplomats. Then came Oahu
Lodge No. 1 and Mystic Lodge No. 2 of the
Knights of Pythias, to which order the de
ceased belonged. Immediately following
came a delegation of more than 100 mem
bers of the Hawaiian Patriotic League and
the general public in carriages and on
foot. The funeral procession was over a
mile in length, and was the largest since
that of Kalakaua.
The route from the church to the ceme
teryâover a mile â was lined with specta
tors. Reaching the gates the military
formed on either side and the procession
passed through. The Alert's battalion
went into the cemetery and took up a po
sition near the Paty vault, where the re
mains of the lamented Kate Field so
lately rested, and which was now to re
ceive the remains of another distin
guished American. The large cemetery
was so crowded with people that Colonel
McLean deemed it wise to order the
troops to remain outside the gates.
At the vault the quartet sang another
hymn; Rev. J. M. Monroe read the Scrip
ture lesson; Miss Grace Richards sang
"Asleep in Jesus"; Rev. Mr. Birnie pro
nounced the benediction, and with "taps"
from the drum corps of the Alert the im
pressive services came to an end.
During the march to the cemetery a sa
lute of fifteen guns was fired at intervals
of one minute from the Government
building. _______^_______

SEADING CORN TO INDIA.
Food for Sufferer* of the Famine to Go
From Thin Country.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 18.â At s meeting
of the Methodist ministers of Chicago
to-day it was decided to co-operate in a
plan originated by Rev. R. G. Hobbs, sec
retary of the Illinois Conference and pas
tor of the Centenary Cnurch at Jackson
ville, to send corn to the starving people
of India.
Mr. Hobbs has asked the farmers in the
vicinity of Jacksonville to make contri
butions of corn for the relief of the famine
sufferers and met with ready response,
the farmers to put the corn on the cars.
The plan was suggested to Rev. S. B.
Leonard of New York, secretary of the
Methodist Missionary Society, who sug
gested that the corn be shipped to Chicago
and the proceeds be used to buy old corn
for shipment in New York. Mr. Hobbs
suggested and asked the ministers to
handle the corn when it arrived here. A
committee was appointed for that pur
pose. _

IVORY BEFORE A
BRITISH COURT
Pleads Not Guilty and the
Trial Is Formally
Opened.
The Prosecution Narrates Events
Leading to His Arrest
in Glasgow.
Every Effort Will Be Made to Prove
His Complicity in a Dynamite
Conspiracy.
LONDON, Esq., Jan. 18.â The trial of
Ed ward J. Ivory, alias Edward Bell, of
New York, who was arrested in Glasgow
on September 13 last, charged with con
spiracy to destroy life and property by the
use of dynamite, was begun in the Central
Criminal Court of the Old Bailey this
morning, Justice Hawkins presiding.
Ivory's counsel comprised Messrs. J. F.
Taylor.Thomas Mathews and Cecil Dwyer.
Solicitor-General Finlay, Solicitor Sutton,
Q.C., C. F. Gill and Mr. Bodkin appeared
for the prosecution on behalf of the
Treasury.
Mr. J. R. Carter, second secretary of the
United States embassy, and United States
Consul-General Patrick A. Collins were in
court. Ivory was well dressed and ap
peared to be perfectly composed. He
pleaded not guilty.
After the prisoner's plea had been en
tered Solicitor-General Finlay proceeded
to narrate the evenu ieading up to the ar
rest of Ivory in Glasgow, beginning from
the time he left New York.
Mr. Taylor, for the defense, objected to
the introduction into the case for the pres
ent by the prosecution of anything that
had taken place outside the jurisdiction of
the United Kingdom which was calculated
to operate to the prejudice of the prisoner.
Justice Haweins overruled the objection.
Mr. Finlay then stated to the court and
the jury that there were two charges
against the prisoner. The first of these
charges, he said, was that of conspiracy
with Tynan and others to cause explo
sions, endangering life, and the second
charge was that of conspiracy with the
same parties to cause explosions which
would endanger property.
Mr. Findlay went on to trace Ivory's
movements and actions after his arrival in
Great Britain, and called attention to the
fact of his having endeavored to find cer
tain men whom be could engage to actu
ally cause the explosions. He next spoke
of the prisoner's letters, in which be said
the words "finding stock" meant rinding
agents. These letters, he contended,
showed that the prisoner was acting in
concert with Tynan and Kearny.
The Solicitor-General proceeded to read
another letter in which the prisoner had
written these words: "Things look very
bad fot me as regards London stock, so
much so that Billy Burt won't do."
This letter, he said, proved that Ivory
had been engaged in making inquiries in
London similar to those be had made in
Glasgow in an attempt to engage men to
cause the explosions. Counsel then read
a letter written to Ivory by Tynan in
which the writer said, "We must have
self-respect from the menâ not men wno
are losing their manhood through drink.
We are both capable of doing this business
personally in any event."
Mr. Findlay, continuing his argument
said that the evidence which the prosecu
tion would produce would linK Ivory with
the doings of Kearny in Antwerp, and
also show that the prisoner belonged to
the order of United Irishmen. He would
also bring evidence to show that Ivory
had attended a secret meeting of the Uni
ted Irishmen in Chicago and that he had
left the United States in concert with Ty
nan, Kearny and Haines.
At the conclusion of the opening argu
ment by Mr. Findlay, the taking of testi
mony was begun.
The first witness called to the stand was
Julius OpholÃer, a waiter employed in the
Victoria Hotel in Amsterdam. Opholster
produced the register of the Victoria
Hotel, showing the arrival on August 30,
1896, of an American who gave the name
of Wilkins. He was accompanied by a
man supposed to be a German.
Clerks employed in the St Pancras
station hotel in London identified the
prisoner as having arrived at the hotel on
August 26 last, and registered under the
name of Edward Bell.
A chemist named Peckham
Ivory as having applied to him for the
purchase of a large quantity of sulphuric
acid.
Thomas Charles Jones, a chemist, testi
fied that Ivory had called at His place of
business and asked to purchase twenty
five pounds of chlorate of potassium, say
ing he wanted it for the purpose of mak
ing experiments.
Solicitor Taylor, for the defense, cross
examined the witness with great severity
as to the identity of the prisoner as the
man who had called at his laboratory.
Associated with the prisoner's counsel,
wnich also includes Solicitor Charles Rus
sell, son of Lord Chief Justice of Eng
land, is Mr. John F. Mclntyre, formerly
Assistant District Attorney of New York
County, who was engaged by Ivory's
friends to come to England and assist in
his defense. It has been said that Mr.
Mclntyre would perhaps be permitted to
plead on behalf of Ivory, but it is now
known that his action in court will be
limited to aiding the other counsel for the
defense in an advisory capacity. Mr. Mc
lntyre watched me proceedings closely
and occasionally conversed with the other
lawyers as the case went on.
Witnesses from Antwerp were called to
testify when Mr. Taylor interposed, say
ing that no sufficient foundation had be ;n
laid by the prosecution upon which to
show concerted purpose or action on the
part of Ivory with the other alleged con
spirotors. Ivory and the others, he ad
mitted, had been seen drinking together
and there had also been an exchange of
letters between the prisoner and Tynan,
but these circumstances furnished no evi
dence of the existence of a conspiracy.
The admission of the Antwerp testi
mony was postponed.
The manager oi the Hotel Havre, at
Havre, testified to the arrival of four men
at his hotel, who were supposed to have

The court then adjourned.
WASHINGTON CABINET GOSSIP.
Senator Perkins Wants a Secretary of
Mines and Mmmg â McKenna May
Not Accept.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 18.âSena
tor Perkins is preparing a bill which he
will soon introduce, providing for a new
Cabinet portfolio â that of Secretary of
Mines and Mining. He believes that this
place should go to California.
The Cabinet sharps are still at work
making slates for President-elect McKin
ley. The treasury secretaryship is what
bothers them most since Mr. Dingley has
declined it, likewise Allison of lowa, and
Mark Hanna, who was mentioned for the
place, wants to be Senator from Ohio. It
is, of course, conceded that Senator Sher
man will be made Secretary of State, and
it was pretty well settled by the gossips
to-day that Long of Massachusetts will be
Secretary of the Navy; Goff of West Vir
ginia, Attorney-General; Henry C. Payne
of Wisconsin, Postmaster-General; ex-
Congressman Wilson of lowa, Secretary
of Agriculture; General Alger of Michi
gan, Secretary of State.
It is conceded that Judge McKenna of
California can be Secretary of the Interior
if he wants toe place, but it is considered
doubtful whether he would be willing to
resign his present life position unless he
received an assurance from the President
elect that he will be appointed to the first
vacancy on the Supreme bench. If he
should decline the honor the place might
be offered to ex-Senator Charles N. Felton.
BLISS REUSES TO ACCEPT.
So Some Other >>ie Yorker Will Enter
McKinley'* Cabinet.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18â It has be
come necessary lor the Republicans of the
State to put forward a candidate for Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet in place of Cornelius N.
Bliss, who, for personal reasons entirely,
could not accept the proffered portfolio.
In view of this situation an important
conference of Republicans was held last
night in the Fifth-avenue Hotel. It is
well known that McKinley desires to give
a Cabinet place to New York, and Bliss'
withdrawal has become a matter of uni
versal regret.
There is talk of putting forward Bliss as
the Republican candidate for Mayor of
Greater New Yore. He could thus re
tain his home in New York and at the
same time be of service to the Republican
party.
Meantime, who is the representative to
Deselected for a place in McKinley's Cab
inet? The conference adjourned last
night without arriving at a decision. It
was the opinion, though, that he will be
known within a few days, and that then
McKinley will be asked to take under
consideration the name presented to him.
A ligeld for Senator.
SPRINGFIELD. 111., Jan. 18.â The
Democrats of the Fortieth General Assem
bly met to-night m caucus and unani
mously nominated ex : Govemor John P.

MORGAN FOR THE
NICARAGUA CANAL
Prompt Action of Congress
Urged by the Ala
bama Senator.
Would Give No Opportunity for
the British Government
to Step In.
Insists on the Bill Being Either
Passed or Defeated Without
Farther Delay.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 18.âSena
tor Sherman (R.) of Ohio was in his seat
at the opening of to-day's session of the
Senate, and was compLmented by many
of his associates on his prospective trans
fer to the premiership of the McKinley
Cabinet. Senator Cameron (R.) of Penn
sylvania was also in his seat, and for
some time held a colloquey with his col
league, Senator Quay, andoiber Senators.
Among the curious petitions and me
morials presented during the morning
hour was one by Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas
for some of his constituents, urging such
an amendment to the constitution as will
rcauire the Supreme Court in ruling
against the constitutionality of a law of
Congress to submit its ruling first to Con
gress, as in the case of a Presidential veto,
and if Congress snail insist upon it the
act shall be deemed constitutional.
A petition from the Bankers' Club of
Chicago, urging the ratification of the ar
bitration treaty, was presented by Cullom
(R.) of Illinois, and referred.
Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania, from the
Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, reported back the bill intro
duced last week by Murphy (D.) of New
York to provide for the erection of a cus
tom-house in New York City, and it was
placed on the calendar. It limits the cost
to $5,000,000, and fixes on the present cus
tom-house site.
The legislative, executive and judicial
and the military academy appropriation
bills were reported and placed on the cal
endar.
Chandler of New Hampshire introduced,
on behalf of Wolcott (R.) of Colorado,
now in England, an act to provide tor the
representation ot the United States by
commissioners at any international mone
tary conference hereafter to be called.
The bill was read in full. It provides that
whenever, after March 4, 18i)7, the Presi
dent of the United States shall direct that
the United States shall be represented at
any international conlerence called by
the United States or any other country,
wituaviewto securing by international
apreement a fixed relative value between
gold and silver as a -money, with free
mintage at such ratio, i c shall be author
ized to appoint live or more commission
ers to such conference, and it appropri
ateg $10o,UOO to cover all expenses.
Chandler stated that the bill was in the
exact language of the three previous acts
providing for representation of the United
States at international conferences, except
the insertion of the words "free mintage
at such ratio." The bill, he added, pre
sented but a single point and one which
all Senators understood. He asked unani
mous consent that the bill be taken up to
morrow for consideration without being
referred to any committee, and there being
no objection, it was so ordered.
The concurrent resolution prohibiting
the use of any part of the new library
building for other than library purposes,
was passed.
Petiigrew (Sil.) of South Dakota of
fered a resolution calling on the Secretary
of State for information as to the doings of
the Venezuela commission and also to fur
[ nisi) a copy of the agreement on the sub
| ject between this country and Great
Britain, which has already been submitted
to the Government of Venezuela.
Gray (D.) of Delaware suggested that
the resolutions should be referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations, but fet
tigrevv pieferredtbat.it lie on the table,
saying that he would call it up to-morrow.
The army appropriation bill was taken
up, Quay being in charge of it. The bill,
as reported, appropriates $23,129,344, or
$2000 more than the House bill, this item
being an increase of the appropriation for
the signal service. The total is $155,558
less than the total for this fiscal year.
There was no discussior., and the bill was
passed with no other delay than that re
quired for its reading rapidly by the clerk.
A bill to provide lor a permanent census
was introduced by Chandler (R.) of New
Hampshire and referred to the Committee
on Census.
The House oleomargarine bill was re
ported to the Senate and Gear(R.) of lowa
moved its reference to the Committee on
Interstate Commerce.
Hill (D.) of New York thought that the
proper reference was to the Committee on
Agriculture, and at the suggestion of
Cockrell (D.) of Missouri the bill was laid
on the table for the present.
At 2 p. m., when the morning hour
closed, a motion was made by Morgan (D. )
of Alabama to proceed io the considera
tion of the Nicaragua canal. The motion
was agreed to.
The President's messige transmitting
the report of the commissioners appointed
to inquire as to the feasibility of construct
ing a canal between the Great Lakes and
Atlantic O;ean was laid before the Senate
and referred to the Committee on Com
merce.
Tlie Nicaragua canal bill was again
taken up, and Morgan (D.) of Alabama
addressed the Senate. He said that the
Committee on Nicaragua canal was unani
mous in its ap-proval of every feature of
the bill. He was satisfied that it was the
best bill yet presented on the subject. It
was more conservative and left more
power in the hands of the President than
any other bill. He mentioned the names
of ex-Senators Edmunds of Vermont and
Brown of Georgia, as enthusiastic friends
of the Nicaragua canal bill, and said that
from all over the United Statesâ East and
West. North and South, and in the cen
ter â it had been supported both in the
Senate and House by men who had con
curred mo>t heartily in regarding the pro
ject as one of indispensable National
necessity, and as one affecting the Na
tional glory and honor.
In the course of his speech Morgan said:
If we do not pass this measure, how are we
to prevent Nicaragua from saying, "Congress
has abandoned the project, and now the Gov
ernment of Great Britain has a right to come
in?" I insist on this bill being passed now or
on its being defeated right now.
We have got matters lying just in front of us
relating to the arbitration of differences be
tween the Governments of the United States
and Great Britain. I want to know wnat the
differences are. 1 want to know what we are
signing our names to in ratifying this treaty.
If the differences relate to the Monroe doctrine
or to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty 1 want to
know. If this is to be an American canal,
under American control, I want to know it. 1
want to know whether we are prepared to
settle a difference of that kind or a difference
in relation tÂ«5 the Monroe doctrine by a court
to be established through the triumphage of
King Oscar of Sweden, or whether it is to b*
settled by the strength and power of the right
arm of the United States, duly asserted in de
fense of its rights.
Morgan then went on to discuss and ex
plain the financial features of the bill,
and said:
If the decision of the Senate is against this
bill on the ground either that the canal is im
practicable or that it would cost too much,
or that it might involve us in conflict with
foreign Governments, express that voice. Let
these men, the directors and managers of me
company, go, and let us no longer stand as
a shadow over them or as an obstacle be
tween them and other parties. Let ut either
accept the measure or discard it, or let us take
our ground where honor and justice calls.
After Morgan closed his speech the bill
went over as unfinished business, and the
Senate, after a short executive session, ad
journed at 5:15 until to-morrow.
HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.
The Day Spent in Contideration of Mit
erlinneout Matter*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.â The
House began business to-day by passing a
bill reported by tne Indian Affairs Com
mittee to prohibit the sale of intoxicating
drinks to Indians.
On motion of Sherman (R.) of New
York a bill was passed extending for two
years the time of completion of the Kan
sas, Oaklahoma Central and Southwestern
Railway through Indian Territory and
Oklahoma.
A special order was "reported from the
Committee on Rules, making private pen
sion bills the order for to-morrow.
On motion of Sherman (R.) of New
York, a bill authorizing the construction
of a bridge across the Rio Grande at El
Paso, Tex., was passed.
On motion of Draper (D.) of Virginia a
bill was passed relating to patents. It
provides that the granting of a foreign
patent to the same inventor or his assign 3
shall not affect the United States Datent,
unless the application lor such foreign
putent was filed at least six months prior
to the application in this country. The
bill provides that the term of two years in
which an inventor can complete his ap
plication may be reduced to one year and
an additional section provides a statue of
limitation in patent cases.
A special order from the Committee on
Rules making private pension bills the
special order tor to-morrow was adopted.
Then the house took up District of Colum
bia business for the rest of the day.
TO BE TALKED TO DEATH.
tale That Probably Awaits the Harrison
Refunding Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 18.â It
seems to be the general belief here that
the Harrison bill for a commission of
Cabinet officers to arrange a settlement of
the Pacific roads debis will be reported by
the House Committee and that it will pass
the House of Representatives. Senator
Gear said to Judge Maguire to-day that
the bill would not be considered in the
Senate until the House had disposed of it.
Judge Maguire does not favor the Har
rison bill and will oppose it vigorously,
but if he sees that it is bound to pass the
House he will propose an amendment
providing that the commission to be ap
pointed shall not report any plan which
contemplates refunding. The Harrison
bill (or Gear bill) is almost certain to fail
in the Senate. The Californians are con
fident it cannot become a law, as Senator
White and other Senators will talk it to
death.

FROM OCEAN TO
THE GREAT LAKES
Report of the Waterways
Commission Sent to
the House.
With It President Cleveland
Submits a Message Favoring
the Project.
Asks for an Economical Appropria
tion to Cover the Cost of
Preliminary Work.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 18.â The
President to-day sent to the House the
report of the deep waterways commission,
made in pursuance of an act of Congress
in 1895, its worfc being to make a pre
liminary examination regarding a deep
waterway from the ocean to the great
lanes. He accompanied it by the follow
ing message:
To the Senate mid House of Representatives: I
transmit herewith the report ol Messrs. James
B. Ancell of Michigan, John E. Russell of
Massachusetts and Lymau E. Cooley of Illi
nois, who were appoiuted Commissioners
under authority of law passed March 20, 1895,
to make inquiry and report after a conference
with such similar Commissioners as might be
appointed on behalf of Great Britain or the
Dominion of Canada, concerning the feasi
bility of the construction of such canals as will
enable vessels engaged In ocean commerce to
pass between the grcut lakes and the Atlantic
Ocean, and the most convenient location and
probable cost of such canals, together with
oiher facts and information in said act relat
ing to their construction and use.
The Commissioners have prosecuted the
work assigned them with zeal and intelligence,
resulting in the collection of a mass of in
formation embodied in their report and its
accompanying exhibits, which is of great im
portance and interest as related to the project
subjected to their examination.
The main advantages of direct and un
broken water transportation of the products
of our Western States and Territories from
convenient points of shipment to our sea
board points are plainly palpable. The re
port of the Commissioners in my opinion,
demonstrates the feasibility of securing such
transportation and gives grounds for the an
ticipation that better and more uninterrupted
commerce through the plans suggested be
tween the great West and foreign ports with
the increase of National prosperity which
must follow in its train will uot long escape
American enterprise and activity.
It will be observed that the report oi the
Commissioners, though as comprehensive as
the time and facilities as their disposal per
mitted, does not definitely deal with the cost
of the work they were called upon to considei
and omits some oi the other details related
to it.
Thus far they have labored without compen
sation and a part of the small sum appropri
ated for the payment of their expenses still
remains unexpended.
I suggest to Congress the availability of
making an economical appropriation for the
further prosecution oi iheir work which will
more surely develop their work to an exact and
complete understanding o! this important
subject. Grover Cleveland.

Summit.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Jan. 18.â Truckee in
winter! What spot more attractive ior
the denizen of the orange land? Wha*
new pleasures are opened to those who
have spent their lives in the lowlands,
where Boreas never leaves the ermine im
print of his frigid fingers. The winter
carnival, now at its best, is a revelation to
even native Californians who have never
tasted of the delights which this moun
tain town affords its guests. It surpasses
all of its predecessors in every condition
which ministers to universal jollity.
Man and nature seem to understand
each other perfectly and co-ODerate
earnestly in an effort to make the fes
tivities of 1&97 memorable in the history
of this locality. From this it may be in
ferred that the weather is ideal â cold cer
tainly, but withal crisp and invigorating.
Bnow fell a iew days aco in sufficient
quantity to make the Bleighing good, but
subsequently ceased in time for the in
auguration of the festival. The sky to
day was without a cloud to threaten the
advent of unpleasant meteorological dis
turbances for some time to come.
lhe influx of excursionists began at an
early hour and continued with very little
intermission throughout the day. The
favoriie diversions were sleighing, skating
and tobogganing, though the piece de
resistance of the celebration was admit
tedly tha ice palace, which has proved, as
it well deserved to do, the great center of
attraction. It is indeed a thing of beauty,
but fortunately for those who are not well
disposed toward Jack frost it cannot be a
joy forever.
The first glimpse of daylight saw the
rink covered with skaters, many of whom
had not participated in this glorious exer
cise since the days of childhood, and
â when the merrymakers "heard the chimes
at midnight" they were still reluctant to
discard their skates and take their ease at
their inns, or wherever else their lives had
fallen. The tobogaan slide was even then
running and moonlight sleighing parties
were just returning from Prosser Creek.
It was, in short, a day oi unparalleled
and unbounded revelry. Never was the
ice so smooth, the snow so well packed,
the toboggans so swift or the air so full of
sunshine, song and laughter. Every one
in "Uncle Ben's" party of Shriners, who
came up from the lowlands yesterday,
voted the excursion the grandest ever
planned.* All the people in the surround
ing country turned out to share in the en-
joyment.
The coasting was the feature of the
afternoon, and many a tip-over occurred
to stimulate fresh outbursts of merriment
and friendly chaff.
One accident only of any consequence
temporarily interfered with the general
jollity. A long bob-sled containing a large
party of lady Shriners overturned at the
foot of Tower Hill, and a heavy sled
which followed closely in its wake dashed
right into a crowd of excited people who
had gathered in the vicinity.
{supervisor Daniel McPheters was struck
squarely and described an arc A medical
examination afterward showed that one
of the small bones of the leg bad been
broken by the impact. Mr. McPheters is
one of the most popular and distinguished
residents of the Truckee Basin, and his
misfortune is deeply regretted by the en
tire town.
But with this exception the sport of
tobogganing proved productive of none
other than the pleasanter emotions. All
sorts and conditions of men, women and
children indulged therein, and an occa
sional spill was always provocative of
huge delight on the part of spec
tators, and accepted with resignation
by the unhappy victims. Incidentally,
the coasters had to run the gauntlet of
a perfect storm o! snowballs every time
the ascent was made, and this phase of
mimic warfare furnished an absorbing oc
cupation for those who were not so fortu
nate as to possess sleighs or skates. It is,
perhaps, a trifle unpleasant to receive an
unannounced snowball on the back of the
neck while engaged in "maiden medita
tion, fancy free," but it Is de rigueur to
look pleasant and return the compliment.
Quite a party arrived yesterday from
Ban Francisco, among the visitors being
forty-two Mystic Shriners on one of their
pilgrimages. From Sacramento and other
way stations, similar bands of excursion
ists helped to swell the incoming tide,
until the town assumed the aspect of a
metropolis at holiday time.
The ice palace presented a superb spec
tacle at night, when countless arc anJ in
candescent lights shed their rays upon
its interior, which reflected them back a
hundredfold and in fantastic variety. The
scene reminded one of a stage-setting of
"cloud-capped towers and gorgeous pal
aces," destined to vanish all too soon and
leave "not a rock behind."
Falling barometers and steady west
windi indicate that those who come this
week may enjoy the cherished novelty a
little longer.
It seems too bad that shortsightedness
on the part of the company prevents the
attractions from being appreciated by
those who wish to come on other days
than Saturday and Sunday.
Yesterday's excursion, however, gave
new hope to the carnival company and it
is planning new attractions and prepar
ing additional novelties and spectacular
effects for future visitors.
No wis the time to visit Truckee. If the
Btorm comes it will be very welcome, bnt
it Isn't needed for sleighing, coasting or
anything else, except, perhaps, its own
intrinsic grandeur.
MOONLIGHT SCENES AT TRUCKEE'S WINTER CARNIVAL
JORDAN SPEAKS IN
STANFORD'S CAUSE
Why the University Should
Be Exempted From
Taxation.
Thirty Thousand Dollars Taken
From Its Yearly Income
by the State.
California's Poor Appreciation of the
Princely Gift From the Late
Senator.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cat,., Jan.
18.â Concerning the bills recently intro
duced in the Legislature for the relief of
Stanford University Dr. Jordan makes the
following statement:
In none of the Eastern States and none of
the countries of Europe are universities,
whether of public or private foundation, sub
ject to taxation. The general rule regarding
such matters is that all institutions which are
not for the purpose of making money, and of
which the income is all devoted to public pur
poses, aa those of education, scientific inves
tigation or popular enlightment, shall be free
from the burdens of taxation. In all of the
States, bo far as I know, except California, col
leges, public libraries, museums and acade
mies of science are also exempt.
In France they have a system by which an
institution is declared to be one of public
utility, and then, whether of public or private
foundation, it is exempted. If our constiiution
â were amended so as to exempt endowed uni
versities, public libraries, colleges and muse
ums outside of sectarian control, and of which
the whole income is devoted to public service,
from taxation, the change would be a wise
one.
There is no other State in the Union that
receives outside gilts iv co cold a, spirit, as
California, and for that reason there is no
large State which hag received so lew gilts.
TMs not because the State is really unfriendly,
but because its constitution and statutes were
framed before these matters came .to 19t con
sidered. For instance, when Mr. Rockefeller
founded the University of Chicago it was ex
empted from taxation and the citizens of Chi
cago furnished all the buildings, duplicating
dollar for dollar the millions which Rocke
feller gave. Mr. Stanford in making a larger
gift than Mr. Rockefeller's exacted nothing in
return, and has received nothing. It would
be fitting as a graceful act of recognition for
the State, which has already sent upward of
3000 students to Stanford University for their
education, to relieve the endowment from
taxation. Already through the generous way
in which Mr. Rockefeller's gift has been
treated tho University of Chicago is able to
expend twice as much each year as Stanford,
though the original gift was less.
The State of New York received Mr. Cornell's
gift of $1,000,000 in the same generous spirit
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1897.
and has added in one way or another some
$4,000,000 to the original endowment, besides
freeing it completely from taxation.
A few years ago Dr. Dohrn and his German
associates established in the city of Naples an
institution for studying the natural history of
the sea. Naples at once exempted the institu
tion from taxation, gave it a site comprising
an acre or more of froutage in one of Its fiDest
parks, duplicated the building, doubling its
capacity ana aided it materially in other ways.
Without going into detail I iay say that, i!
Stanford University had been offered to any
large Eastern city or to any city of Europe, ar
rangements could have been made without
difficulty to duplicate its buildings and re
lease its endowment from taxation. In Cali
fornia, however, out of its present income of
$150,000, more than $30,000 each_ year is
taken for State and county taxes, and the bal
ance of the $200,000 representing its annual
cost of maintenance is taken from Mrs. Stan
ford's private mean* â pin money which she
had saved up for the building of kindergartens
and for additions to the museum. As fast as
she is able to get control of the balance of her
husband's estate it will doubtless be turned
over to the university, but with the increased
income the taxes also increase. On the will
ingness of the State to relieve the institution
oi this burden in great measure depends its
future growth. Thirty thousand dollars a
year saved in the income of the university
means much. The continuance of several of
its most important departments, as mining,
engineering and law, depends on tnis saving.
For tne State to tax endowed institutions of
public utility like Stanford University, the
Academy of Sciences, the Throop Polytechnic
School and the Lick School of Mechanical Arts
is to rob Its own pockets. It takes money from
the highest use to put it to a lower. "A dollar
in a university," Emerson says, "is worth
more than a dollar in a jail."
In the original statute under which the uni
versity waa founded it is provided that the in
come is to be forever devoted to the purposes
of education, non-sectarian, and so far as may
be, free; in other words, to the same purposes
as are reached by the public school system of
the State. You will notice also that by the
constitution of the university the trustees are
required to make an annual report of their
actions to the Governor of the State of Califor
nia. In case of a failure on the part of the
trustees to conduct this trust aa a public trust
should be conducted, as for example, if they
should force sectarian tests, then it is the duty
of the State to take possession of the property
and carry out as a trust tb.6 intention of the
grantor. In other words, Mr. Stanford ar
ranged to make the university property prac
tically a gift to the State, but put its control
in the hands of a board of trustees so that It
could never be influenced by the political
changes taking place instate affairs; while
on the other hand he left It to the State of Cal
ifornia to *cc that the property was forever de
voted to its proper use.

Stanford has never been so great as it is
at present. Matters were so arranged this
year that a large number of students were
induced to compete. Although but three
can represent Stanford in the iritercol-
legiate contest, twenty are competing for
the positions. Many of the under-class
men do not expect to be chosen by the
judges, but with commendable spirit they
have persevered, trusting to the experience
obtained and to future debates for their
reward.
The question for the first debate to
morrow evening has been changed some
what from the original one selected. It is
as follows:
Resolved, That the use of injunction in cases
prominently affecting public interests la dan
gerous and unnecessary, it being agreed that
1. Injunction shall be construed as includ
ing the ordinary m^ans of enforcement at the
discretion of the court.
2. Dangerous shall be interpreter solely with
reference to the sutisiactory working and de
velopment of American political and soclul in
btituuons.
The speakers for the affirmative are:
J. AI. Ross '97, W. Hull '98, and B.
Wells '97. Tho.Â«* on the negative are:
Miss Steboins '97. E. H. Rotbmck '98,
and S. Dickson '98. Professor Abbott of
the law department will preside and in
troduce the speakers. Professors B. A.
Ross, S. J. Brun and G. E. Howard will
act as judges during the series of debates.
MITCHELL STUCK GOES UP.
Given JEnourjh Tote* to , Elect in a Re
publican Caucus.
SALEM, Ob., Jan. 18.â The House met
at 10 A. M. Three rolls were called, show
in thirty-four members present, six less
than required for organization. Three or
four Democrats came in to-day ana an
swered the rollcall. This is looked upon
as if the combination against organiza
tion is breaking up, and may predict the
organization of the House to-morrow.
In the Republican caucus Mitchell was
given 47 votes lor the United States Sen
ate, one more than required, but a num
ber of these will not vote for Mitchell
until Jonathan Bourne is elected Speaker.
Bourne claims that Mitchell promised him
alx votes for Speaker for the votes Bourne
secured for Mitchell. Mitchell having gone
back on this, Bourne, with twenty-five
followers, stays away so as to prevent or
ganization. Five of those who stay with
Bourne are Mitchell Republicans, but in
sist first on Bourne being Speaker. If the
organization is effected Mitchell will be
the next Senator.
The Washington Contest.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 18.â The Sena
torial situation on the eve of the first bal
lot is decidedly mixed. Judge Turner,
free silver, seems to have the lead, with
Cline, Populist, second. Squire, free sil
ver, is considered out of the race, though
he was working hard to-day and may
gain unexpected strength. Davis, Popu
list, who was reported to have withdrawn,
denies this and says he will go in to-mor
row with a strong vote. Tne fnsionist>,
consisting of Iree silver Republicans,
Democrat* and Populists, are caucusing
to-night, as are the Republicans also. The
first vote will be taken in joint session to
morrow noon.
Arraigned at Los Gains.
LOS GATOS, Cal., Jan. 18.â George
Dreaves, who was charged wLh assaulting
Thomas Thompson with a deadly weapon
during a row near Los Gatos on Saturday,
was arrested by Constable Reynolds this
morning and arraigned before Justice
Beggs to-day. His examination was set
for to-morrow, pending which he was re
leased on his own recognizance. The men
quarreled on the ranch where they were
employed, during which Dreaves scratched
Thompbon up pretty badly with a can
opener.
Body found Near Bush Point.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan 18.â
The corpse of an unknown man was found
near Bush Point this morning. The de
ceased had been fairly well dressed, and
in the pockets of his clothes were a num
ber of railroad maps and time-tables, be
sides a pair of eyeglasses. Tuere was no
other clew to his identity.
SENATOR JONES
TO BE RETURNED
Nevada Republicans Settle
the Senatorial Fight in
Caucus.
Receives Thirty-Five Votes to
Three Cast for George
Nixon.
Practically Insures His Re-Election
on the First Ballot in the
Legislature.
CARSON, Nsv., Jan. 18.â At a Republi
can caucus to-night thirty-eight silver
Republicans, or a majority, were present,
and of this number United States Senator J.
P. Jones received thirty-five votes, the re
maining three going to his only opponent,
George Nixon. This insures Senator
Jones' re-election on the 19ih inst., when
the first and probably the only ballot for
United States Senator will be taken.
Nixon received the vote of the Hum
boldt delegation. All day Sunday and to
day the Hum boldt delegation were urging
him to come to Carson, but be refused to
leave bis sick wife. Seeing that bis elec
tion was impossible, they met and dis
cussed the best way of disposing of the
situation. There was considerable differ
ence of opinion. Some wanted Nixon' to
go into the caucus, accept bis defeat
gracefully and bow to the will of the ma
jority. Others held that this would be a
sacrifice of the principles fought for and
they wanted to refuse to let his name go
to the caucus at all, but to carry the fight
into the joint session and make some red
hot speeches.
Nixon was again wired to, but be
merely replied that his wife was atill
quite low, and that his friends could use
their own judgment. It was finally de
cided that Nixon's name would be placed
before the caucus, where he could "take
his medicine like a man." A.uy other
course would simply land him outside of
the party and be his political rum. it
was argued that if Nixon were in the city
he would consent to no other plan, as he
was a politician who always stood by the
rules of the game.
The caucus was called at 7:30 o'clock,
and but two members remained away.
Nixon's name was placed before it for
United States Senator along with that ol
John P. Jones, and some very hot speeches
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
were made on both sides. Oralorv could
be beard resounding through the Capitol
building as the battle royal was fought.
The caucus resulted in the naming of
Jones.
The eighteenth session of the Nevada
Legislature convened here to-day with
every member of both houses pres
ent. A caucus was held last even
ing and agreed upon the usual
appointments as follows: A. J. Mc-
Cone of Storey, president pro tern. of the
Senate; T. J. Osborn of Lincoln, secretary,
and Patrick Corbett of Btorey, sergeant-at
arms. In the Assembly Lemuel Allen of
Churohill was made Speaker; S. L. Mc-
Naughton of Esmeraida, speaker pro tern .;
George R. Bradley of Ormsby, sergeant-at
arms, and Nate Roff of Washoe, chief
clerk.
The Senate was this morning opened by
Governor Sadler, and the oath of office
was administered to the new members by
Justice Belknap. The Governor's mes
sage was received and laid on the table.
No other business was transacted except
the routine of organizing and the intro
duction of a resolution regarding the
granting of pardons.
Secretary of State HowelJ opened the
Assembly and Judge Bonnifield admin
istered the oath. No further business was
transacted to-day.
IDAHO'S DEADLOCK.
Democrat* licfuÂ»Â« to Vote for Ihe Popu
l<*t Choce.
BOISE CITY, Idaho, Jan. 18.â The
Populist caucus this morning again
switched to Claggett and used all possible
effort to induce the Democrats to join and
give Claggett the necessary thirty-six
votes, but without avail.
The first ballot resulted: Ciaggett 26,
Dubois 25, Lewis (Pop.) 17. The second
ba.lot: Claggett 29, Dubois 19, Nelson
(Pop.) 13. The votes for Nelson and
Lewis were cast by Democrat*.
There was great activity in the Claggett
camp all day. mair.ly with the object of
inducing enough Democrats to insure his
election to vote for him to-morrow, but as
far as could be learned this evening his
supporters were unsuccessful. Whether
the Populists will in the next ballot
remain with Claggett or switch to Nelson
or Lewis and by the aid of the Democrats
elect one or other of those geutlemen is
uncertain.
The Dubois men claim there is little
chance of the Democrats and Populists
coming tOKether, and that ultimately
Dubois will receive enough Democratic
vote 3to elect him.

Third Trial of the Man Who
Last Saw William Woot
ton Alive.
Beginning of Another Chapter in the
Mystery Veiling the Rancher's
Disappearance
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 18.â The third trial
of Professor W. A. Banders for forging the
name of William Wootion to a $4000 draft
on the Kutner-Goldstein Company ot this
oity was begun before Judge Webb in the
Superior Court to-day, and before evening
four jurors had been sworn.
the cate involves the mysterious disap
pearance of Wootton from his ranch in
the foothills above Reedley nearly three
years ago. Although sufficient evidence
has never been gathered to prefer the
oharge, Sanders is believed to have been
responsible for Wootton's disappearance.
Wootton was last seen at his ranch on
January 31,1894, according to authentic
information. He was then seen driving
away with Sanders by a farmhand named
Charles Rohloff. Since then no trace of
him, either dead or alive, has ever been
found, although & determined search was
made. At Banders' second trial the de
fense had a witness who claimed that he
had met the aged rancher in San Fran
cisco after February L
The jury evidently did not believe the
witness, as it took them only forty min
utas at the conclusion of the trial to
arrive at a verdict of guilty. At Sanders'
first trial, whioh was held in June and
July of 1894, the Jury disagreed. The sec
o.nd trial took place in April, 1895.
Upon his conviction Judee Webb sen
tenced tne professor to ten years' im
prisonment at Folsom. The defendant,
when refused a new trial, appealed to the
Supreme Court, which last September
reversed the denial of Judge Webb and
granted a third trial.
The same attorneys appear in the pres
ent trial as in the former two. The pros
ecution is being conducted by District
Attorney Snow and Samuel J. Hinds, who
is employed by relatives of Wootton. The
defendant is represented by Frank H.
Short and F. E. Cook.
The prosecution claims that it has some
new and very important evidence to pre
sent against Sanders at this trial, which
will prove beyond question, they assert,
that he is guilty. What this new evidence
is cannot be learned, but the men back of
the prosecution are not given to making
statements of this kind that cannot be
relied upon.
The alleged forgery for which Sanders
iÂ« on trial is believed to have been but a
beginning of a wholesale execution of for
treries whereby the <!efendant expected to
u-ain possession of Wootton's wealth after
having got the ranch out of the way.
The prisoner says that a man named
John Knausch, who, as Sanders testifies,
"had the longest beara of any man in
California," purchased the ranch from
Wootton, and that He (Knausch) trans
ferred the property to him (Sanders) ac
cording to a huge speculative scheme they
had formulated.
The prisoner says that Knausch was
present at the Wootton house on Janaary
31, 1894, when the big deal was consum
mated. But tie defendant has succeeded
in finding only two witnesses who ever
-aw or heard of the mythical John
KnauÂ«ch. When placed upon the stand
at the last trial these two men gave en
tirely different descriptions of the man.
The mystery surrounding the disappear
ance of Wootton has neypr been surpassed
in the Btate's history. For miles, toward
source and outlet. Kings River has been
dragged for the aged rancher's body, it
bf ing the general supposition that San
ders disposed of him there, but never a
trace was found.
Sanders is nearly 60 years of age and the
two years' confinement in the county jail
here has told seriously on his health. He
appeared in court this morning looking
pale and emaciated, and expressed the
fear to a Call correspondent that he would
not be able to bear up under the "torture"
of the three or four weeks the trial will
lasu
MURDER NEAR CUCAMOGA.
Aged William Hespe Waylaid and Killed
While Returning to His Ranch
From Ontario.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Jan. 18. â Accord-
Ing to the opinion of officials in the vicin
ity of Cucamonga and North Ontario,
William He^pe, an aeed resident of the
former place, was clubbed to death yester
day on the road between Ontario and his
home.
The body of Hespe was carried home in
the family carriage, to which was attached
a gentle horse, which kept to the road as
though driven by its careful owner. The
sight of her husband covered with blood
on the floor of the carriage, his temple
crushed ana his face cut, came near prov
ing fatal to Mrs. Hespe; Slie is still in a
critical condition.
Coimable Murphy and a posse went
back over the road that Hespe had
traversed from Ontario to Oucamonga,
and carefully investigated every foot of
iLte way. They found Hespe's hat lying
at the roadside, and at one spot discovered
<i pool of blood. Beyond these there were
no indications of a Straggle.
The wind was blowing heavily at the
time and this had the effect of obliterating
trace* o'" the crime by drifting sand over
the road.
The Coroner was notified to come from
Han- Bernardino, and the Sheriff also was
acquainted with the fact that a mimier
bad been committed. Every suspicious
character in Cucamonga and Ontario is
.under surveillance, but up to this time no
one has been arrested.
Robbery wÂ»s iinqueotionably the motive
for the '.-rime. Hespe bad come to town
to meet his son-in-law, D. J. Bergstrom of
San Pedro, and was to have received a
sum of money with which to purcuase
nursery stock needed on the Hespe ranch.
Berg.troin missed the train to this city
for Ontario and telegraphed to his father
in-law to wait until next Sunday. This
telegram was not delivered to Hespe.
Bergsirom oolioves that some one learned
of his intention to giye the old man money
and that had he renched Ontario ami ac
companied his father-in- law to Cuca
monta, he too would lave been mur
dered.
Ii is believed that Hespe confided the
lact that he was to receive money to some
one,, and that this information reucuud
desperate characters who waylaid and
murdered him.
SAN JOSE GRANGE'S PETITION.
Legislature Asked to Pass a Law Making
Shooting in Orchards a
Misdemeanor.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 18.âHorticul
tural Commissioner Elirhorn and a num
ber of prominent orchnrdists appeared be
fore the Board of Supervisors this morn
ingâthe time set for hearing the petition
of the San Jose Grange and Fruit-growers'
Convention, asking ttjat robins be pro
tectedâto discuss the merits and demerits
of the robin as a destroyer of insects and
pests injurious to orchards and vineyards.
The board adopted a resolution asking
the Legislature to pass a law making it a
misdemeanor for auy person to 3'ioot in
side of an orchard or vineyard witnout
first obtaining permission of tne owner.
Ho action was taken to protect the robins.
Commissioner Ehrhorn presented a
verbal report as to his investigations as to
the diet of the robin. He said his exami
nations had convinced him that tne bird
was an all-round feeder. The crops of
biids taken from the Goodrich orchard
were full of olives. Also pepper berries
and many bettles were found in abund
ance. He had found no ladybirds, but
the fact that the bird iiad not hesitated at
beetles, with tneir hard wings, ied him to
believe that they would readily devour
the ladybird and other pest-destroyers.
He had been toJd the robin would not eat
the ladybird because it was bitter, but he
thought it did not exceed In bitterness
either the olive or the pepper berry. He
had as yet found no peach-Dorer in a
robin's crop. He thought an investi
gation should be made of the food habits
of all birds found in the country. Re
ports had reached him of sparrows de
stroying the tender huds on trees.
E.E. Goodrich spoke of the depreda
tions of the robins. He thought they
should not be protected, as they did great
damage to olives and grapes.
Frank Burkholder and W. D. Lewis
spoke of the experiment recently made
on the Cozzens ranch with the robin as a
destroyer of the peach-borer. Tue former
had never seen a robin eating -worms, but
had seen them devouring fruit buds, and
the latter had seen robbins gather in great
number and devour every worm they
could find while the men were uncovering
the trunks of trees so the Dirds could get
at the peach-borers.
G. W. Wortben of the San Jose grange
said he had seen robins eating canker
worms and catching and eating the canker
worm moths. He thought further inves
tigation as to the bird's diet should be
made.
Colonel Hall was of the opinion that
the robin was a benefit to orchards.
Hunters did great damage to the trees by
shooting at the birds. Shooting injured
the limbs and destroyed the buds. J. P. C.
Murpny was of the same opinion. S. S.
Haines thought the present laws sufficient
to protect the orchards, if enforced.
Commissioner Ehrb m said shot was a
most damaging thing to a tree. Tne
wound makes a running sore that will
never heal. He said hunting in an orchard
was a nuisance and thai when signs for
bidding shooting were put up hunters
shot them down.

CLAIMS HEIRSHIP
TO PIETRA'S LAID
Los Angeles Prisoner Say.i
He Was a Son of the
Millionaire.
Attacks the Will Which Gave the
Estate to the Dead Man's
Brother.
Contest for a Princely Domain B gun
in the Ventura County
Courts-
VENTURA, Cal., .Jan. 18.â A docu
ment was this afternoon filed in the office
of the Clerk of the Superior Court of
Ventura County which gives promise of a
series of sensational developments. It is
a petition to revoke the probate of the
paper claimed to be the will of the late
Antonio Schiappia Pietra, the wealthy
Itslian rancher of Ventura.
Schiappia Pietra died on February 1,
1895, at San Kemo, Italy, whither" he had
gone in search of health. He was never
married, and, it was generally supposed,
had no kindred nearer than a brother. In
January, 1896, nearly a year after
Scbiappia Pietra's death, a small riece of
paper purporting to be in his handwriting
turned up in Ventura in the possession of
his brother, Leopoldo Schiappia Pietra.
By the terms of this brief document
Leopoldo was made his brother's sole heir
and the executor of the will. On the 18th
day of January, 1896, this alleged will was
admitted to probate, and Leopoldo quietly
stepped into a-n estate that is estimated to
be worth anywhere from $1,500,000 to
$2,000,000.
Now comss the most interesting feature
of the case. In the Los Angeles County
Jail is now confined on a serious charge a
man called John Lee, but whose baptismal
name is Michael Antonio Ortega. The
paper filed in Ventura to-day comes from
Ortega and is presented by his counsel,
the Hon. Frank F. Davis of Los Angeles.
It sets forth among various other interest
ing matters that Ortega is the son and
only chiM and sole heir-at-law of the de
ceased Schiappia Pietra; that the paper
admitted to probate as Schiappi Pietra's
will is a forgery, and that Ortega is the
lawful inheritor of his father's immense
estate. It is currently reported that Or
tega's parentage is within the knowledge
of a dozen reputable witnesses, and that
he is backed by friends sufficient to enable
"him to conduct a most vigorous fight for
his patrimony.
The estate, which is one of the richest
and best-paying in Southern California,
was originally a Spanish grant, and con
sists of several thousand acres adjoining
the city of Ventura, all ot which is under
a very- high state of cultivation. Besides
this there is choice business property in
the cities of Santa Barbara and Ventura.
The home of Leopoldo Schiappia Pietra,
in this city, is one of the finest in the
county, and is luxuriously furnished
throughout.
Ortega, who is now contesting for his
interests, is charged with an attack upon
the 13-year-old daughter of a wholesale
saddler of Los Angeles, whioh is alleged
to have been made two months ago. He i
is about 28 years of age and quite intelli
gent. His mother, Mrs. Carrie Bisbee, is
at present a resident of Oakland. The
latter admits Ortega to be her son by An
tonio Schiappia Pietra, but never allowed
it to become known on account of the un
pleasant notoriety which she would gain
by going to court. Mrs. Bisbee is very
highly connected throughout Southern
California. Her brother, Joseph Brobbo,
was until recently manager of the Arling- j
ton Hotel at Santa Barbara, while her |
niece iÂ» Mrs. Richard Hearne, wife of one j
of the leading grocers of this city. She]
h.HH other relatives who are also highly
connected here.
UKIAH MURDER MYSTERY.
Body of a Man Who Was Slain While Ht
Slept Is Found on a River
Bank.
UKIAH, Cal., Jan. 18.â While fishing
for salmon in Russian River yesterday
evening, Marion Hoss discovered the hand
ef a human being protruding through
the sand on the west bank, about
100 yards south of where the county road
between this place and the Insane Asylum
crosses Clark Bridge, two miles southeast
of town. The discovery was reported to
the Coroner, J. H. Barter,? who repaired
to the scene. Barker succeeded in recov
ering the body of a man from the sand
and debris by which it was covered.
A jury was empaneled this morning and
an inqueÃt held. The verdict, which was
approved by Coroner Barker, found that
the name of the deceased was unknown;
that he was aged about 40 years and came
to his death aoout four months ago at the
hands of parties unknown, and that tiie
immediate cause of his death was a blow
struck on the back of the head with some
blunt instrument which crushed his skull.
He was described as a man of light com
plexion and iighL brown hair, 170 pounds
in weight and 5 feet 9 inches in height.
The casÂ« is now in the hands of the
Sheriff. The generally accepted theory is
that the murdered man was one of the
mahv hoppickers who come to this part
of the country each year in September
and October. These men generally camp
along the riyer bottom, and it is believed
that this one was murdered and robbed
while asleep. His skull was broken in in
a number of places. He was evidently
buried to hide eviuence of the crime, but
the flow of the water in the river uncov
ered the body. The theory that he was
murder.'d while asleep is borne out by the
fact that when found the body was
clothed only in an undershirt and a pair
of drawers. A two-bit piece and a plug of
tobacco were found in a shirt Docket. No
papers were found which would give a
clew to the identity of the body.
LIBELED BY NEIGHBORS.
Mountaineer Ben ion found Innocent of
a Murder Charge.-
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 18.â Coroner Long,
Deputy District Attorney Williams and
County Health Officer Ad air returned to
day from Burrough Valley in the moun
tains, whether they went to investigate
the report brought down by Constables
Dentis and Burton that- Edward Benson
had strangled his three babes after the
death of their Indian mother. The result
of Ihe inquiry was that the oJd and pe
culiar mountaineer. was proven innocont.
and the officers are somewhat wrathy over
being !ed to make the expensive and dis
agreeable trip for nothing.
It appears that the report was started by
neighbors who are at Â outs with Benson.
It was ascertained that his wife died im
mediately after giving birth to triplets and
they, died shortly afterward.

well as being marked by a refinement
which is too often lacking in acts of their
kind. The ballets were especially good.
San Francisco is so used to ballets com
posed of untrained young women gathered
toeether and given a few weeks' hasty
training that it was quite a treat to see
the skill of the corps de ballet at the
Columbia last night. It is a long time
since two such accomplished premieres as
Emelia Bartoletti and Amelia Mayer
hoffer have been seen here. Some of the
prettiest of the ballets were tne Feast of
the Lanterns and the riack of Roses.
Among: the many specialties which won
the applause of a large audience were the
feats of agility performed by William
RuÂ«e as Chaos, the imp of darkness, and
the musical comedy acts given by Richard
T. Brown. Some of the latter's songs are
not unknown to frequenters of the Or
pheum, but most of them were new and
his jokes and pantomime work were clever,
the burlesque of a grand opera singer be
ing especiail good.
In the Benedictine vaults, a new scene,
Richard T. Brown and William Huge in
troduced some funny pantomime work.
William Frabel was good as the auction
eer and as ihe Mandarin's doctor, In the
gardens of the Mandarins, anotner effect

The New York street scene with its
"Hoboes' Soiree" was a "turn" that took
well, and the fancy bicycle riding intro
duced in this act" evidently appealed to
the cyclists piesent. To enumerate all
the specialties worth seeing in "The
Devil's Auction," however, would be to
name them all. With the strong tide of
popular favor for variety acts which pre
vails at present it is safe to predict a pros
perous run for tne latest edition of the
â¢'Forever Devil's Auction."
Alcazar Theater.
- The Alcazar presented a martial appearance
last night, when "A Fair Rebel" was per
formed, with the assistance of Company L,
F,irst Regiment of Infantry, N. G. C. The foyer
of the theater was prettily decorated with
numerous flags, fernp, palms, etc., and a guard
of honor lined the entrance from the street to
th.' auditorium and saluted officers from the
Presidio, Alcatraz and Angel Island as they
passed in to the boxes, which were all pleas
ingly ornamented with flags. Governor Budd
and his staff had been invited to grace the
opening nigh.', of "A Fair .Rebel," and some
members ot tne staff were present. The^Gov
ernor sent at telegram to say that if it nad
been possible he would have been present.
A number of nalistic features were intro
duced into the performance ot "A Fair Rebel."
Rial telegraph wires wuro set upou real tele
graph poles before the admiring eves of the
auditnce in the first act and later on real dis
paiehes were received by Operator James F.
Hogan from the main office oi the Postal
Telegraph Company, the said dispatches pur
porting 10 be real war dispatches. Another
feature was the large number of soldiers on
the stage. As a rule in theatrical
warfare the battles on which
the fate of nations depends are lost and
won by iess than a dozen men all told, but
there teemed to be wiiole battalions of soldiers
marching about the Alcazar stageâ so many
thui the stage would nothoid them ail at once,
and the head of the army had to disappear in
the wings belore there wus room for tho flank
to come vii. T:ns abundance of gallant guards
men gave a very realistic appearance to "A
FairKeb'J."
On tne whole the play was well acted by the
Alcazar company.
May Buckley made quite a hit with her com
pany of pickaninnies, and had to give an en
core parade. Miss Katu Belmour was clever as
Mrs. Wood, the lady who shoulders a musket
and gees forth to fight. Mrs. Bates was thor
oughly effective as Aunt Margie, a Southern
spinster with designs on the heart oi a North
ern officer. George Osbourne, who played the
role or the victim of her machinations, de
served Ril the applause he received.
Hugo Toland. who acted the lover oi the
Fair Rebel, labored under difficulties last
night, as he had not thoroughly recovered his
voice and was not very sure ot his hues.
Francis Powers, who rÂ«.veied in his favorite
role of a wicked ioreii;n adventurer, might
also have been on better speaking terms With
his part. Beatrice Lieb acted the heroine and
shewed a tendency to overact. F. S. Clayton
acted well and won immense applause for a
startling fall wnen he climbed up to the tele
grapn wire and was shot down. The wonder
was that he escaped without breaking any
bones.
At the Orpheum.
The Orpheum's chief new feature this week
is the Franz family, a team of acrobats who do
startling fe^ts of strength and agility. The
Franz wear ordinary evening dress, and at
firSt sight it looks startling, to say the least, to
see ladies, in long black smin gowns and
gentlemen in dress suits forgetting the rules
of etiquette and building aiem^eives into
columns and hopping over one another like so
many grrsshÂ«>pper.-<.
Binns and Bums are doiignn amusing mu
sical comedy act, and John \Vilsou and Bertha
Waring appear as the tramp and the dancing
girl. Wilson has pleased this City before as a
tramp, and Bertha Waring seconds him fairly
well.
The Hungarian orchestra vary their pro
gramme nightly and Kiralfy's coryphees have
new and gorgeous costumes. Noble and Abuchi
and Marsaud remain.
Grand Opera-house.
"Against the Stream" opened at the Grand
last night to a crowded house. Miss Ro.su
monde O'Connell's debut was, of course, the
topic of conversation among the audience.
-vliss O'Conneil s part, Lively Majj, was but a
sm-11 one, but the little lady got all there was
to be got out of it, and she showed heisel;
to be a capable and painstaking actress.
Mortimer Snow as Dick Radlord, in various
disguises, did his b st with tlie small material
furnished, him. Edward Heron made a gen
uine hit as Fritz Oppenheimer, ms specialty
with Lottie Williams being loudly applauded.
Fred But ler, Fran , is Hatch, Johu J. i J ii;rsun,
Leslie Morusuo and the rest of the gentlemen
in the cast did well, but there was not much
for any one. Nettie Graham, the usual
dramatic heroine, impersonated by Victory
Bateman, was well acted.
The fire scene was very effective and received
great applause.
At the Tlvoll.
"Jack and the Beanstalk" was enacted at the
Tivoli last uight. A new style of programme
which is almost a pamphlet in size is adopt
ed, the interior adorned with a picture,
a la Beardsley, representing an esthetic
looking lady playing an antique instrument.
The programme bears the'leseud "1879-1897."
This is probably the last week of the clever
burlesque "Jack and the Beanstalk."
People's Palace.
Mahara's Mammoth Colored Minstrels com
menced their second -week to a fair-sized house
last evening. The company is a large one, and
pleased its hearers, if applause goes for any
thing.
At the Baldwin Theater, this evening," will
take place the first Nordiua operatic concert.
TO SWIM ABOUND SEAL ROOKS.
R. B. Cornell Challenges J. Cogglin to
a Match for a Gold Medal.
R. B. Cornell of the Olympic Swimming
Club has challenged J. Coggiin of the
Dolphin Swimming Club to swim a r;ica
around the seal rocks, off the Cl iff House
shore, for a #olt medal of the ralae of $35.
TLe medal is to be furnished by the Olym
pic Swimming Club.
Cogglin is the man who attempted
on two different occasions to swim
the Golden Gate subsequent to
the accomplishment of that feat by
Charles Cornell, and failed, it is said, owÂ«
ing to cramps.
Cornell is one of the best, strongest and
most ambitions of the young amphibians
in the City. He holds all the American
amateur records from a quarter to *nve
miles. He is also a memoer of the Cali
fornia Swimming Club.
Coggliu's friends say he wiil accept tho
challenge, and that tue match will take
place in a short time.
Cornell is now in training. He takes a
swim out to the seal rocks every day or
two.
Butchers Form a Union.
To-morrow evening there will be a mass
meeting of the journeymen butchers of the
City at the Templo, 115 Turk street, to form a
union of those engaged tn the butchering y
business for mutual benefit and improvement.
The commi: tee of organization has received
promises of support to the new union from
quite a number oi signers to the call lor
VVednesduy night's meeting. Good speakers
will be on hand to exp.ain tho nou'i ot an
organ izat:on, and all journeymen butchers
are requested to be present.
VALLEJO CONFLAGRATION.
Fire Destroys the Schoolhouse at the
Good Templars Home for
Orphans.
VALLEJO, Cal., Jan. 18.â The school
building at the Good Templars' Home lor
Orphans was destroyed by fire on Satur
day night The blaze was discovered at
11 o'clock, and word was telephoned to
town. Soon half the male population was
on its way to the home. It was at first
supposed that the home itself, containing
upward of 200 children, was on lire. When
the townspeople arrived at the scene tha
children were found tip and dresÂ«ed, and
the larger boys engaged in removing furn
iture irom the burnins schoolhouse.
Nothing c< uid be done toward saving tha
structure, and it was soon a mass of em
bers.
The Vallejo Board of Education has
been renting the building for some ye;trs
past, and, for the present, schooi will ba
carried on in a temporary structure or in
rooms in the homo. 'Jho building was
erected several years ago and was insured
for $4000.
Two plasterers had been en^a^ed in tha
building during the day repairing some
broken spots on the walls, but they claim
to have left no fire behind. At 5 o'clock;
in the afternoon the janiior went through
the rooms and closed the ou;er doors and
locked them for the night. He reports
that there were no signs of tire.

Although Mr. Wanamaker will not go

A PUBLIC DUTY.
It is a duty to the public on tha part of
every citizen of light and leading to at
tend the mass-meeting which is to be held
at the Merchants' Exchange this after
noon. The meeting is called for the pur
pose of petitioning Congress to pass the
Nicaragua canal bill, and it should take
no urging to induce every man who takes
an intelligent interest in the welfare of
California to be present and add to the
petition all the weight which his influence
can supply.
It is expected the Nicaragua canal bill
will be taken ud in the Senate this week,
and there is a probability that it may also
have a hearing in the House of Repre
sentatives. The Senate seems inclined to
favor the passage of the bill, but the House
is more doubtful, and a resolute expres
sion on the part of the business men of
San Francisco wilt therefore be of value
to the advocates of the measure in urging
its enaction.
The Senate steering committee decided
last week to give the bill the right of way
in that body and it will be taken up there
at once. Senator Morgan will have charge
of the measure, and it is reported that he
is desirous of reaching a vote before the
end of the week. It is said that not many
Senators will care to speak on the ques
tion, though most are believed to be favor
able to it. If this is true the Senator's de
sire for. an early rote may be attained,
and one-half of the battle in Congress be
won before the week closes.
In the House a different condition of
affairs prevails. There are no bills of
great National importance on the House
calendar, and it will be remembered that
the Committee on Rules gave a bearing to
the Nicaragua canal bill last week. From
this we may draw a promise that the sub
ject will be taken up by the Representa
tives at a comparatively early date, even
if it should be postponed until after this
week. The House, however, i 3 not- so
much inclined to the measure as the Sen
ate, owing to the fact that a considerable
number of Representative-* believe there
should be a strict economy in all National
expenditures.
Such being the condition of affairs in
Congress, a decided action on the part of
the business men of Ban Francisco will
undoubtedly have considerable weight in
advancing the measure. It will give evi
dence that the people do not regard the
construction of this canal in any sense as
an extravagance or waste of public money ;
that on the contrary it is looked upon as
an economy in the highest sense of the
word, and is urgently needed for the pro
motion of all the industries and interests
not of the Pacific Coast only, but of the
whole Union.
We urga every citizen, therefore, to at
tend the mass-meeting. The assembly
should be large enough to render it cer
tnin the resolutions adopted express the
sentiments of the business men of San
Francisco. The meetinsr is to be Held this
afternoon at the Merchants' Exchange.
Be sure you are present.
GOOD ROADS.
It is noted that wherever a State Legis
lature is in session at this time the subject
of improved highways is receiving more
than ordinary attention from the Legis
lature and from, the public. In fact
measures looking to that end are regarded
as more important in every Northern
State than any other. The Southern
Legislatures seem to be devoting their time
mainly to school improvements, and there
can be little question that they are right in
doing so, since all things taken into consid
eration good schools should precede good
roads.
In California we are as a matter of course
in nearer touch with the Northern than
with the Southern States. Our school sys
tem is so near perfect under existing con
ditions in the State that the advancement
occupies but little part of public attention
or legislative study. It is different, how
ever, with the road system. In the con
struction of our highways we are so far
behind our needs it is not surprising to
learn that no less than seven biils designed
to promote road improvement will be sub
mitted to the present Legislature.
It is reported that during the fiscal years
'94-95 there was expended in California up
ward of $2,000,000 for repairs on highways.
That is an enormous sum to be expended
merely for repair work and is in itself an
evidence that the roads have never been
well constructed. It would therefore very
clearly be an economy to expend more
money on the first cost of the roads an 1
save s iarge portion of -this enormous out
lay required to keep them in order.
The subject deserves the most careful
consideration on the part of the Legisla
ture. It is not one on which a decision
should be reached hastily. There are
good arguments why the construction of
the main roads of the State should be
placed under State control, and there are
also gdod arguments why the present
system should be maintained. The ex
ample of Santa Clara County in road
work shows us what can be accomplished
under the present laws if rignt men are
elected as Supervisors. On the other
hand, there are some counties too poor 10
construct and maintain thorouehly good
highways, and it would seem to be expe
dient for the State to assist, them in pro
viding the main roads of travel.
There is no reason why California
should not have as goud highways as any
State in the Union. We have not the
severe climatic conditions to contend
against that are so hard on road construc
tion in the East. Moreover, a large por
tion of our roads run through level
valleys, where the first cost of construc
tion is comparatively slight. We have in
abundance all the material needed (or
road worK, and we certainly have the
skill and energy necessary for construc
tion. It is to be hoped, therefore, the
present Legislatura will devise some
means for promoting this much needed
improvement, and that California in this
as in other things â will take rank among,
the most advance: Stites in the Union.
ARIZONA.
The publication in the New York Tribune
of an article by Whitelaw Reid which was
republished in The Call ol yesterday will
serve to direct the attention of Eastern
people to the advantages of Arizona as a
place of winter residence for those whose
lungs are not strons enough to endure
either the severe cold of the East or the
damper weather of California.
To persons in normal health no better
winter climate can be found anywhere
than that of San Francisco and California
generally. Mr. Reid, however, like &o
many other persons of weaker lungs, has
found a drier atmosphere necessary to his
health, and has discovered during a flve
months' residence, in Southern Arizona
what is to him and those like him a veri
table winter paradise.
In giving his experience Mr. Reid stated
that during the live months he was in
Arizona in wmter there was but one day
when the weather made it actually un
pleasant for him to take exercise in the
open air. He goes on to say: "Of course,
there were a good many days which a
weather observer would describe as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1897.
'cloudy* and some that were 'showery,'
but during thes* five months (rom No
vember, 1895, to May, 1896), there were
only four days when we did not have bril
liant sunshine at some time during the
day."
The large nnd varied experience of Mr.
Reid in searching for winter sunshine en
ables him to speak as an expert. He has
tried all the lamous lands of the Old
World in search of a pleasant winter cli
mate for weak lungs and has found none
equal to that which we have in our own
country. He says:
The atmosphere is singularly clear, tonic
and dry. I have never seen it clearer any
where In the world. It seems to have about
the same bracing and exhilarating qualities
as the air of the Great Sahara in Northern
Africa, or of ttie deserts about Mount Sinai in
Arabia Petrsea. It is much drier than in the
parts of Morocco, Algiers or Tunis usually
visited, and arier than any part of the valley
of the Nile north of the first cataract. It seems
to me about the same In quality as the air of
Die Nile between Assouan and Wady-Halfa,
but somewhat cooler.
The visitor who goes to Arizona for the
winter will find more attractions than
that of climate. Although regarded as a
desert Arizona has wonderful possibilities
of wealth. Her sands can be made as
fruitful as the richest soils in the Union
by irrigation. Many of her valleys are
already becoming noted as fruit-growing
districts, and there can be little doubt
that, like California, Arizona will yet be
richer in her orchards than in her mines.
People who go there simply to seek for
health will find abundant inducements to
remain and make comfortable homes for
themselves all the year round.
One feature of Mr. Reid's article is
worthy of special note. He informs East
ern people that those who go to any con
siderable Arizona tawn with idea 3 derived
from novels or from the Arizona Kicker
will be greatly mystified. â¢ "He will find,"
says Mr. Reid, "as many churches as in
towns of a corresponding size in Pennsyl
vania or Ohio, and probably more school
houses." The standard of living and the
general culture of Arizona is thoroughly
American, and not inferior to that of any
district of equal number of inhabitants in
the East. Arizona is, in fact, a thoroughly
American community, sharing the desti
nies of. American States, having the same
aspirations with any of her sister com
monwealths, and it is gratifying to see
that these facts are beginning to be under
stood by the representatives of high cul
ture in the East.
WINTER SPORTS.
A writer in MeharCs Monthly comment
ing upon the reports of abundant violets
displayed in California on Christmas day,
and the fact that they were gathered in
the open air, expressed some regret that
Eastern States do not have the enjoyment
of this fragrant flower in midwinter, but
found consolation for himself and for his
readers in the thought that while Califor
nians have midwinter violets and roses
they have not the delights of toboggan
ning, skating and sleighriding.
It is evident the writer had not read re
ports from all parts of California. He
was unaware of tiie fact that at this very
time the Californian who desires to do so
can leave the region of blooming violets
and with a comparatively short ride can
transport himself to the rezion where
snowy fields and icy lakes afford him
every sport known to the midwinter
eayetiesof the East. There is at this time
at Truckee a festival of such gayeties go
ing on. In that mountain city can be
found every pleasure which ice and snow
afford, when conducted under the most
favorable circumstances.
The recent visit to Truckee of the mem
bers of the Mystic Shrine from this City
calls renewed attention on our part to the
delightful sports which are now under
way at that place. We are told in the re
ports that the visitors to Truckee enjoyed
themselves with sleighridingfrom Truckee
to Dormer Lake and there 1 had the pleas
ure of fine stating. In Truckee itself the
toboggan slide was running to its full ca
pacity and the skating-rink and ice-palace
were crowded. Good hotels afford ample
accommodation for visitors, and the hos
pitality of the people of the city make
every stranger realize that he is a wel
come guest.
There shonld be more visitors from San
Francisco to Truckee. The changes of
climate, scene and amusement would be
advantageous in more ways than one.
There is a certain health-giving tonic in
the icy air of the snow-covered mountains
which to many people would be more
beneficial than the breezes of the ocean or
the perfume of orange groveÃ and violet
beds. The. ice festival furnishes some
thing more than a mere variation from
ourcitrus fairs and rose festivals. It offers
health, strength and abounding vitality to
all who take part in it.
We have not made as much use as we
should of our mountain region. We have
dug gold from it; we have cut down trees
on its high slopes; we have made of sev
eral places in it summer resorts, ' and
Truckee of late has led us to behold the
pleasures it offers for midwinter festivals.
Nevertheless these are but Â».he beginnings
of the things that should be. Our higher
mountain slopes and the lofty valleys are
destined to become the dwelling places of
8omeÂ»of the sturdiest manhood and most
beautitul womanhood that are to make up
the glory of the California that is to be.
In the dawn of this new era of pros
perity we should begin to profit by all the
advantages and opportunities which theÃO
mountain lands afford. We should seek
to bring immigrants not for our valley
lands only to make the desert blossom as
the rose, but to subdue the forests of the
higher hills and transform the mountain
wilderness into civilization.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
George Russell, the cattle king of Nevada,
who was chairman of the National Livestock
Commission at the World's Columbian Exposi
tion and who was chosen one ol the three
Presidential Electors from Nevada in the re
cent election, is among the arrivals at the
Lick.
Mr. Russell has been in the cattle business
in Nevada for about twenty-five years. His
partner is Mr. Bradley, and the firm of Russell
& Bradley own an enormous rancn, reaching
through the three counties of Elko, Lander
and Humboldt. This ranch is stocked with
many thousands of cattle. However, there are
not so many there as formerly, nor through
out the State, for many cattle were sold early
in the fall and shipped away to be fattened on
the Eastern corn.
"The cattle in Nevada have been pretty well
cleaned up," said Mr. Russell. "Beef cattle

there now are worth from 6% to 7 cents, and
stock cattle that were worth irom $12 to $14
last summer are now worth $18 to $20.
"The growers are at last making money and
the ruture promises very well for the cattle
men. For five or six years past they have had
a hard pull.
"There seems to be a better demand than I
ever saw before for Nevada cattle in Kansas,
Missouri and other States. Our cattle are not
accustomed to eating corn, but it is said that
after a week or so they take to it and grow
right along.
"The East especially likes our Hereiords, of
which we produce a great many, and for these
from 15 to 25 cents a hundred pounds more is
paid tnan tor other cattle. Everybody who is
in the cattle business is encouraged greatly
by the present condition of things.
"So much money has been lost hitherto
that now the stockmen are getting aroused by
the advanced prices to the place they had
long wanted to get.
"Mining is looking batter in Nevada, too.
North of Elko a big company is opening up
some largo properties. Hundreds of men and

Mr. Russell will probably be in the City for
some time.

CARNIVAL AND CYCLISTS.
A Meeting Calleil for Thursday Night
at the California Hotel.
Hon. F. H. Kerrigan of the executive
committee of the Golden Gate Carnival,
who bas charge oi the wheelmen's inter
ests in the carnival, has called a meeting
of the representatives of the Association
of Cycling Clubs, members of the Cycling
Board of Trade and others interested in
bicycling matters, to be held in the assem
bly-room at the California Hotel onThurs
day evening next at 8 o'clock.
Bicycle men are enthusiastic over the
prospect of havine a day entirely devoted
to themselves and promise to render
hesrty support to the carnival. In view
of this fact it is desired that a full attend
ance shall be present, S3 the representa
tives of local wheelmen go East to attend
a meeting of the National Wheelmen at
Buffalo next month. It is expected that
bicycle men from all parts ot the United
States will be there, and local representa
tives desire to be in a position to know
what to tell Eastern riders what they may
expect when they reach San Francisco.
Among the features thai it is proposed
to introduce on bicycle day is a platoon of
police mounted on wheels. There are a

A DAY OF REST,
AND AID FOR INDIA
Pastors Will Try to Hold
the Public to Only Six
Days' Work.
Horrors of the Famine in Asia
Described to the Minis
ters.
A Big Mass-Meeting Will Bo Held,
With These Two Objects
in View.
It is now practically settled that a mass
meeting will be held in order to stir up
public interest in sending relief to the suf
ferers from the famine in India.
The petition circulated by members of
the faculty ot the University of California
and citizens of Berkeley is being widely
circulated and long rolls of signatures are
accumulating to the request that prompt
aid be sent to the starving sufferers.
"Yesterday the clergymen appointed by
the various bodies held an enthusiastic
meeting at the Young Men's Christian
Association in conjunction with well
known citizens of this City and of Berke
ley. The feeling was freely expressed that
the time .had come for prompt action.
The following gentlemen were appointed
a deputation to wait on the Mayor and
request his co-operation and call a mass
meeting of the citizens of San Francisco.
A committee consisting of Rev. F. J.
Masters, i). D., representing the Methodist
Episcopal pastors, James L. Barker 'of
Berkeley, Rev. FranK S. Ford, represent
ing the Christian church; Rev. William
C. Pond, representing thÂ© Congregational
pastors; and Rev. James Sunderland,
D.D., representing the Ba-ptist pastors,
was appointed to wait on Mayor Pneian
yesterday afternoon, but owing to a pres
sure of public business he could not re
ceive them, and it was therefore decided
that James L. Barker, chairman of the
committee, should communicate with
Mayor Phelan and arrange an early date
for the mass-meeting. In the meantime
Mayor Phelan has issued the following
call for aid for the starving sufferers:
Any contributions of grain or money for the
relict of the people oi India, now suffering
from famine, will be properly cared for and
forwarded if consigned to the Columbian
Bnnking Company of San Francisco, which
volunteers to act as custodian or agent.
The Sabbath observance committees,
appointed by the various ministerial
bodies, met at the Young Men's Christian
Association Hall yesterday with the ob
jectof arranging a mass-meeting to agi
tate rest on tne first day of the week and
also to take preliminary steps for having
a Sabbath law introduced into the Legis
lature.
Rev. Dr. Ketcham of Berkeley was ap
pointed a committee of one to go to Sac
ramento and lobby for a Sabbath observ
ance bill, which it is hoped will be intro
duced by the Assemblyman from Ban
Mateo County. It was resolved to utilize
the old bill of 1895 and to leave its modifi
cation to the Committee on Morals. Rev.
Dr. Spalding of St. John's Episcopal
Church, Rev. Dr. Case antt Rev. F. Far
rand were appointed a committee to ar
range for a mass-meeting. Most of the
pastors were in favor of stirring up
workinernen to a sense of their right to
one day's rest a week. Rev. F. Boynton
of the First Baptist Church, however, con
tended that the demand for a State Sab
bath law should be based solely on re
ligious grounds.
Rev. Dr. Chalfant of Pittsburg gave an
interesting address at the Presbyterian
Ministerial Union on missionary wark
in Northern China. In speaking of ;he
financial aspect of the case he said that
the churches in Northern China when
once established become self-supporting.
"Money goes a long way there, a man who
has an income of $3 a month is well oft,
if he receives $5 a month he can live at
the top oi the style and keep open house.
The native churches in order to show
their respect for their pastors fixed the
ministerial salary at $5 a mouth, but
recently they advanced the sum to $8 a
month. The missionaries do not want it
to be more for fear of cultivating a mer
cenary spirit, as a higher salary might
possibly induce people to enter the minis
try from mercenary motives." Dr. Chal
fant said he wanted his bearers to keep
before them the fact that China is yield
ing to the Gospel.
The Baptist Ministers' Conference was
given an encouraging accovnt of bis work
by Evangelist NoryelL Frank Sullivan,
editor of the Baptist religious organ in
this City, spoke in an interesting way on
"Religious Socialism."
Rev. D. Carroll spoke at the Methodist
ministers' meeting on "Evangelization in
Cities." He strongly urged the needs of
tho work, saying: "The f'lture of the
City is the future of the Nati >n."
At the Congregational ministers' meet*
ing Rev. Dr. Aron Willian-s spoke on
"The True Conception of God."
At the Christian Church Meeting yes
terday Rev. J. W. Hudson, associate min
ister of Central Christian Church of Oak
land.spoke on "The Attitude cf the Minis
ters Towardthe Scientific Spirit."
The specia'i meetings at the iSpworth M
E. Church, conducted by Rev. H. W.
Baker, will continue till Thursday. The
revival meetings at tho Third Baptist
Church on Powell street are proving very
successful.
C. V. S. Gibbs, at the earnest solicitation
of the board of trustees of Sw .Luke's
Hospital, has consented to continue in
the office of the presidency of th*t institu
tion. His .three years' administration
has been so successful that the hospital
has a balance of $7000 cash in hand.
The fifteenth quarterly convention of
the Epworth League Alliance wil: be held

S. H. Tacy's Advice.
The members of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association have recently received
letters from S. H. Tacy, who was formerly
manager of the association. In these he urges
the association to affiliate with the Phila
delphia Commercial Museum. He states that
the cost would be only $50, and the a 'vantages
he â¢claims would be great. The museum has
an exhibit of raw and manufactured products
from all parts of the world, and it is a dis
tributing center for all news and information
that would be of value to commercial and
manufacturing bodies. The museum will
probably be a State body. Tacy's proposition
will be considered. v

LAUNCH OF THE
STEAMER HELENE
A New Vessel for the Island
Trade Successfully
Floated.
She Will in Future Fly the
Wilder Steamship Company's
Flag.
Scaling Schooners Have Not Done
Well Off the Coast and Hunters
Are Despondent.
The new steel steamer Helene built for
the Wilder Steamship Company of Hono
lulu was launched yesterday from tne
Union Iron Works. Miss Dickson per
formed the ceremony of christening the
new craft and as the graceful vessel glided
toward the waters of the bay she broke a
bottle of champagne over her bow and
gave her the name under which she will
sail from San Francisco. On arriving at
Honolulu the Helene will be put under
the Hawaiian flag and a native name will
be given her, the present one being be
stowed only for the save of her American
registry.
The new steamer is 175 feet long, 29 feet
11 inches broad and 14 feet 10 J^ inches
deep. She will be used in the inter-island
trade, and is expected to be one of the
fastest boats in the company's fleet. The
latter consists of the Kiuau, Claudine,
Likelike, Hawaii, Kilauea-How, Lehua,
Mokoliiand the Helene. The directors of
the company are the following men, who
are well known in San Francisco: C. L.
Wight, president; W. Q. Irwin, J. F.
Hackfeld, W. F. Allen, S. B. Rose, J. A.
King and G. C. Beckley. The company's
CJaudiue will be remembered as the
steamer that brought the news of the
revolution to San Francisco and the es
tablishment id a republic in Hawaii. The
tonnage of the vessels 13 almost the same,
but the Claudine has more than double
the horsepower of her rival.
Nevertheless the builders of the new
vessel are willing to wager that on her
trial trip the Helene will make a better
record than the CJaudine. The engines
and boilers will at once be put in the new
steamer, and by the end of the month she
will probably go on her trial trip. If she
proves a success she will at once sail for
Kqnolum. The engines have been built
under the supervision of W. A. Johnston,
chief engineer ot the Wilder Steamship
Company, and C. L. Wight, president of
the company, arrived on the Monowai in
order to. be present at the launching. A
drawing was made by the Union Iron
Works showing the Helene as she will ap
pear when on her way to Honolulu.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
Rio de Janeiro got in from Hongkong via
Yokohama and Honolulu yesterday.
Among the passengers were Mrs. Enarna
L. Hunt, and Miss Emma Hunt. Mrs.
Hunt is the representative on this coast
of the tirm of | Jesse Moore-Hunt Com
pany, and her father is Harbor Commis
sioner Cole. She and her daughter have
been on a holiday trip to Japan and China,
and yesterday Commissioner Cole went
out in the tug Governor Markham and
boarded the Rio before she docked.
Other passengers on the steamer were:
C. J. btemier, Paul Strebe, E. Griffin and
wife, H. Kruse and wife, S. G. O. King
and wile. C. S. Moore, T. Monre, H. Alt
man, S. H. Kruse and P. FunKe.
The sealing schooner Rlary Taylor put
in here yesterday to land Thomas Irvine,
one of "the hunters, who was suddenly
taken ill while off theFarallones. He was
senl to St. Maiy's Hospital and if all goes
well will return home on the next Victoria
steamer.
The latest news from Eneland is any
thing but reassuring to hunters ana seal
ers. The latest telegraphic returns are to
the effect that 9kins have brought 12% Der
centless than they did last month and
that tbe general average is only 30s
4J, a price much below what skins
brought last year. In consequence both
owners and hunters will be losers on the
season's catch.
Lulu Gwinn, a 16-year-old girl, was ar
rested on the water front yesterday by
Officer George Lake and booked at the
â¢Harbor Police station for the reformatory.
For weeks she has been making her head
quarters in a water-front resort, and being
under age the police determined to arrest
her.
The Branch Hydroeraphic Office has

THE FORFARSHIRE
PLAYED IN LUCK
Murderer Butler Was
Twice Refused a Pas
sage on Her.
First He Wanted a Berth aDd
Then Offered to Ship at a
Shilling a Month.
One of the Crew Was Held on a
Charge of Manslaughter at
the Time.
"Is the Swanhilda the four-master
sighted outside by the Rio de Janeiro?"
is the question everybody along the front
is asking just now. Only two vessels
rigged in this manner are dne, and as the
Oiivebank left before the vessel on which
the murderer of Captain Lee Weller and
Arthur Preston is supposed to have taken
passage, it may be her.
The ves3el in question was sighted at
2:15 o'clock on the 16th inst. in latitude
33 north, longitude 132.02 west. She was
in the regular course of the Australian
sailing ships, and according to the officers
of the steamer should reach port in a few
days. The Oiivebank is out sixty-one
days and the Swanbilda fifty-six days
from Newcastle, N. S. W., but as the lat
ter is the smartest vessel of her class in
the Australian trade, the chances are
somewhat in her fnvor.
Captain Evan* of the British ship For
farphire tad a narrow escape from having
Butler for a passenger. Had he been in
the mood to give the necessary accommo
dation both the murderer and his wife
would have sailed for this port on the
clipper. ,
"It happened just this way," said Cap
tain Evans yesterday. "We were lying in
Sydney harbor getting ready to sail for
Arthur Preston Was the Last Known Victim of Butler, the Supl
posed Murderer Expected on the Swanhilda and for Whom
the Detectives Are Waiting at Meig-gs Wharf. The Above
Sketch Shows the Spot in Which the Murderer Buried
His Victim.
Newcastle to load for San Francisco,
when a man and his wife came along and
wanted to take passage with us. lie
gave the name of Frank Pierce, and ex
plained that his wife wns a very sick
woman and that the doctor had ordered
a long sea voyage for her. I explained
that I bad no accommodation, as my wife
and children were aboard, so he went
away, and I never saw Mrs. Pierce or But
ler again. Later -on I learned thatahe se
cured a passage on another British ship,
but died before the vessel sailed for San
Francisco.
"After reaching Newcastle I again baa
an encounter with Pierce or Butler. He
explained to me that his wife had sailed
for San Francisco on another vessel, and
that he, being out of money, wanted to
work his way across. He offered to ship
at a shilling a month, and, saying he had
a captain's certificate, proposed to stand
one of the watches. He was a big, strong
looking fellow, and at first I felt like ship
ping him, but something deterred me and
I said no. I am glad I did, because then
I would have had two hard characters on
board."
Captain Evans referred- to one of his
crew, who is accused of at least man
slaughter and who made his escape as
soon as the vessel dropped anchor in this
port, when he said "two hard characters."
The tragedy occurred in Cape Town and
the British authorities ordered the culprit
taken back toKngiand for trial. The For
farshire was getting ready few sea and all
hands were called to bend sail. Joseph
March', the boatswain, noticed that Desire
Poweils, one of the men, had not come on
deck. He went into the forecastle and
ordered him out. Powells relused to move
and the boatswain went in and forced him
out. In the fracas that followed Powells
was knocked down, ana then he went for
March like a crazy man. He bit and tore
like a wildcat, and getting the forefinger
of the boatswain's right hand between his
tteth he almost bit. it off. He chewed
pieces of flesh from the unfortunate man's
neck and almost tore all his clothes from
his back belore he was secured.
Marcfi was earned to his bunk and a
few days later blood poisoning set in and
he died. On the preliminary examination
Powells was remanded on boara the For
farshire and went on her from Cape Town
to Newcastle and thence to San Franci3co.
From here the vessel will go to England
and there he would have to stand trial, so
he thought the best thing he could do was
to escape, and now the Forfarshire knows
him no more. He and Butler would have
made a threat pair in the ship's crew.
Captain Evans was here last in the
Cromartyshire as chief officer. That was
ten years ago and ever since he has been
master of the Forfarshire, but this is his
first voyaue to San Francisco in her. The
vessel has been almost continuously trad
ing to Portland, and last year Captain
Evans' little daughter was born there and
was christened Jane Willamette Evans.
Complaints have been made In regard to
the food served on the ship, but the
mate's log shows that the. sick men got
eggs and milk, while the little babe had to
go without. The whole trouble was over
a question of potatoes, and everybody
who has been to sea knows what an
important question that is. They cost an
enormous price in Cape Town, but never
theless the captain laid in a good supply.
When a couple of weeks out the men
refused to eat potatoes, and the captain at
once told the coot "well and good. Let
them go without until they come to me
and ask for them.'' Hence the trouble.
The Forfarshire is a welt-foun.l ship in
every respect, but she seems to have more
than her share of sea lawyers aboard.
Captain Evans is accompanied by his
wife, and while many of the crew do not
like "the old man," there i 3 not one of
them but what would risk hiÂ« life for "the
old man's wife and the baby." Mrs.
Evans is not a nervous woman, but still
she shudders whenever the name of Butler
and the possibilities of his having been a
sailor on the Forfarshire are discus3ed.
At Meiggs wnarf everybody is on the
qul vive.
The Pacific Mail Company's City of
Sydney aid not get away until nearly
midnight yesterday. She left the Mail
I dock at the usual houi, but came to an
anchor off Meiggs wharf to await the
arrival ol Chinese who were in transit and
who had been detained on Angel Island
by the quarantine authorities. The mail
was also delayed, and when the Millen
Griffiths put U aboard and brought the
Chinese from the station the City of
Sydney went on her way.

NO COMPROMISE
WITH STANTON
A Four Per Cent Grain
Rate Is Not to Be
Considered.
Duty of the Railroad Commis
sion to Make Investiga
tions Alone.
He Thinks Such a-Ccurse Wou d Not
Interfere With Pending
Litigation.
Railroad Commissioner James Stanton
returned yesterday from a several days'
duck hunt and a tramp in the marshes.
The Railroad Commissioner said he re
turned with some webfeet dangling from
his belt, but he would not say how many.
In regard to the reported willingness of
the Southern Pacific to compromise on a
4 per cent wheat rate Commissioner Stan
ton said last evening:
"No such proposition has been made to
me, nor to any other member of the com
mission that lam aware of. The sugges
tion may have been thrown out as a feeler
and if that is the case I do not think it
will go. i have no idea that the commis
sion would enlertain such a thing. Let
the litigation go on if we cannot settle the
matter in any other way.
"As to therights and duties of the com
mission there can be no controversy.
They are clearly and specifically denned
by the constitution, a section of which,
relating to the Railroad Commission, was
published in to-day's Call in connection
with the interview with Mr. Clunie.
â¢The statement by Mr. Clnnie of
the powers of the commission under
tbe constitution, and to some extent
his presentation of the situation are cor
rect.
"We have the powers and the authority
of a court. We can subpena Southern
racihc officials before us to testify, and if
they do not come we can punish them
for contempt. We also have tbe power to
compel the production of their books and
other material evidence.
"These things," said Commissioner
fitanton, "it is not only in our power to
do, but in the scope of our duty. The
constitution says so. I made a motion at
a meeting of the commission to proceed
under the authority given us, but it did
not prevail, I understand, for the reason
that it was feared it might interfere with
the pending litigation. My- opinion is
that it would not in any way embarrass
the litigution. We could proceed with in
vestigation along other lines.
"I expect to bring the matter up again
at the next meeting. We can make more
progress proceeding under our own au
ti ofity than we can through any court.
I think the Southern Pacific policy is one
of delay, by which the authorities hope
to get a commission at the next election
which may be more favorable to them."
The next meeting of the commission is
one week from to-morrow.
BONDING STREET WORK.
Sausallto 'Likely to Adopt a Plan That
Has Proved a Success -Else
where.
An experiment is being tried in Sausa
lito which is exciting much interest
among local street contractors. Seven
blocks of macadamized and sewered streets
are being advertised at present, which is
some cause for excitement, but; the mode
of payment for the work is the feature
which is discussed earnestly on the aide
walks and on the exchange.
When the contract is let the contractor
obligates himself to take payment in
aerial bonds, which will run for ten years
with interest at 7 per cent. The interest
is payable serni-annually and one-tenth
of the bonds each year. This is a new
feature in this neighborhood, bat in Los
Angeles all street work is now done on
that plan. Some two years ago a piece of
work was done under the ten-year bond
system, as it is called, which led to I. W.
Hellman protesting against payment and
alleging that the law was unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court decided last summer
that the law was all right and street work
has received an impetns since.
A large asphalt paving contract on Main
Btreet has just been completed and the
contractor has received an assessment
which is over $100,000 in value, all to be
paid in the ten-year bond?. Visalia in
1894 did over $30,000 worth of work in the
same manner. The reports from holders
of the bonds show that they value them
as good Investments. In several Southern
California towns and cities the plan is in
use, but in the region round San Francis
co it has never been tried, and Sausalito,
in making the experiment, is going to
help other places wondejfully if the ex
periment is successful and contractors
will take the bonds.
Ernest McCollough, City Engineer of
Sausalito, in speaking of the movement
said:
Ii Sausalito lets Its contract next Monday
night it will be in order for San Francisco and
some of the Cities around the bay to do like
wise and help remove the burdens of taxation
from the shoulders of the people. So long as
street work is necessary there should be easier
metnods ol payment required than at present
exist. Many people now have to sell their
property to pay for its improvement, when
they might uasily be able to raise each year
one-ten tli the amount with interest.
TO KNOW HER WAS
TO ESTEEM HER
Last Tributes Laid on ths
Bier of Mrs. J. A.
Lees.
Burial of a Woman Who Was
Thoroughly Gcod and
Charitable.
The Clergy, B'nch and Bar, Mer
chants and Municipal Officers
Were in Attendance.
Surrounded by her sorrowing family
her bier covered with sweet, delicate,
flowers, all tokens of the great love borne
her by friends who wept sincerely that
she had passed away, Mrs. Jane Amelia
Lees lav yesterday in tne drawing-room
of her late home at 1022 Pine street.
The lovable wife, mother and friend had
many callers, who paid her their last re
spects and accompanied her to the grave.
The old home in which she and her ven
erable husband have lived for a score of
years, and in which they have brought up
their children, was entirely inadequate to
accommodate those who wished to be in
attendance and give a glance of farewell
to the' deceased.
Early in the day floral tributes began
arriving, and long before the hour set for
the ceremony the parlors of the house were
overcrowded with pieces that were tri
umpbs of the florist's art, and fragrant
tokens from sad-hearted ones the de
parted had left behind.
Two floral offerings, monuments In
themselves, were there from the "upper
office," where the men under Captain
Lees hold headauarters, and from the
officers of the police station proper. Each
of four companies of patrolmen was also
represented by superb offerings. These
were irrespective of two magnificent
pieces ordered by telegraph from Chicago
by William and Robert Pihkercon, Cap
tain Robinson and Sergeant Lindheimer
and Captain John Curtfn.
The small flowers, violet?, cut roses and
hand bouquets, filled up the interstice?
between the larger offerings, so that the
casket barely peeped out from beneath
the mass of verdure and colors*
Captain Lees, the chief mourner, saw
many of hia friends and hers around the
casket of his loved one yesterday. During
the four decades he has been one of this
City's representative men and one of its
executive officers, he has conje in contact
with almost every one worth knowing,
and they joined with him in his sorrow.
Aside Irom the leading bankers, merch
ants, attorneys, Judges and municipal of
ficers of the present and of days past.it
must have been gratifying to him if he
saw through his feverish eyes the com
rades who worked their way up through
life with him in his profession, but who,
one after the other, dropped out as time
pinned its limit on their term of servitude
and emblazoned their names on the re
tired list-
There was ex-Chief of Police Burke, now
nearly 76 years of age, who handled the
department when there were but only
fifty officers on the iorce. Ex- Captain
Short, wuo is on the shady side of 89 years
of ape, came with his word of consolation.
Ex-Captain Douglass, "Washington Irving,
ex-Sergeant Harmon and ex-Sergeant Duf
tield were some of the relics of the days
when Captain Lees was himself a youth
and their companion.
The religious ceremonies were conducted
by Rev. Horatio Stebbins, himself a com
panion in youth of Captain Lees and a
dear friend (and adviser of the deceased.
There was but a prayer and later on a
benediction prior to the conveyance of the
remains to the cemetery at Laurel Hill.
The choir, consisting of Mrs. Martin
Schultz, Miss Xena Roberts, Alfred Wil
kie nnd J. F. Fleming, led by Martin
Schultz, rendered "Jesus, Lover of My
Soul" and "Thy Will Be Done."
The pallbearers were: Chief of Police
Patrick Crowley, Reubon H. Lloyd,
Thomas W. Walkin-ton, Dr. John Night

RED-HOT FIGHT AT
OREGON'S CAPITAL
0. H. Paxton Tells of the
Keen Strife Over the
Senatorship.
The Masterly Play of Jonathan
Bourne to Even Up With
Mitchell.
The House Controlling the Situation
and Doin; Nothing â Position of
Joseph Simon and Others.
The Oregon fight for the Senatorship is a
red-hot affair, with many sides to it.
There is a myriad of candidates and all
kinds of quarrels have been eprung.
Grievances that had in a degree been
buried for many years have been dug up
and are being aired all around.
Senator Mitchell, Joe Simon and Jona-
PRESIDENT O. H. PAXTON of the Portland Consolidated Ratf
way Company, Who Tells of the Oregon War Over the
Senatorship*
[Sketched from life by a " Call" artiit.)
than Bourne are all tilting their spears at
each other, aad lots of other people are
chipping in and lending variety to the
contest. O. H. Paxton, the well-known
lawyer of Portland, who has been a num
ber of times a member of the Legislature,
District Attorney of Multnomah County,
and who has filled other offices, is here and
gives graphic particulars of the struggle.
Mr. Paxton is president of the Portland
Consolidated Railway Company, owning
about forty miles of street railway, and is
on his way East on business in connection
with the road.
"The Senatorial fight now on," said he,
"is peculiar. At present it is Senator
Mitchell against the field. He is opposed
by a number of gold-standard Republicans
and by the Democrats, the Populists and
â¢.he union bimetallic members. The last
three are all free silver parties. The gold
standard Republicans oppose Senator
Mitchell's re-election because be declines
to make a public pledge not again to vote
for the free and unlimited coinage of sil-
Ter at the ratio of 16 to 1. The free-silver
parties refuse to support him, notwlth
standing he has always in the past been a
free silver man. because of the fact that
he supported McKinley on the St. Loui3
platform in the late Presidential election.
"Our State elections occur in June.
The present Legislature, except the hold
over Senators, were elected last June.
Jonathan Bourne of Multnomah County,
who might be termed the leader of the
free-silver forces in Oregon, was elected to
the Legislature as the joint nominee of
tne Mitchell Republican faction and the
Populists. He is now a candidate for
Speaker of the House. He claims that
Senator Mitchell and his managers prom
ised to support him for this office in con
sideration of his services in electing Mitch
ell members to the Legislature in June.
"Senator Mitcheli refuses this support,
finding that by supporting Mr. Bourne
he would lose the votes of some of the Re
publican members who are now support
ing him. Mr. Bourne, by' reason of this,
has withdrawn his support from Senator
Mitchell, and is now actively opposing
him.
"Mr. Bourne is supported in his- fight
for the speakership by the union bimetal
lic members, the Populists and the Demo
crats, all free silverite?. The Mitchell
forces are supporting H. L. Benson of
Grants Pass.
"The constitution of Oregon provides
that two-thirds of the members elected
should be necessary as a quorum to trans
act business in either nous<* There are
sixty members of the Houseâ hence the
presence of forty is necessary before any
business can be transacted. On the day
appointed the House met and effected a
temporary organization by selecting a
temporary Speaker, a Bourne man, and a
temporary clerk.
"Since then the Bourne forces, number
ing more than one-third .of the members
of the House, have remained absent, and
because two-thirds are not present no
business-can be transacted by the House.
The result is a comDiete tie-up of the
House. Mr. Bourne is a very determined
and able man, and has no superior in the
State as an organizer and leader of an op
position. He was the organizer and
leader of the opposition which defeated
Senator Dolph's re-election two years apo.
"From appearances he has the power to
prevent the organization of the House
until the Mitchell forces join in electing
him Bpeaker. Should they do this it is
said several of the Republicans now will
ing to vote for Senator Mitchell will leave
him, which would probably defeat him.
If be does not assist Mr. Bourne it seems
certain that the Bourne forces will not
vote for him. Tnus it would appear that
Senator Mitchell is in a precarious situa
tion. Everything at the present time
points to a prolonged and bitter fight,
with a probability of a deadlock or the
election of some new man on ihe last bal
lot.
"We have had a number of such Sena
torial fights of late years in Oreeon. In
1882 Senator Mitchell was the leading can
didate, but could not secure his election.
The fight continued until the last half
hour of the session, when Mr. Doiph was
sprung as a new man and elected on the
last ballot. In 1885 Mr. Hirsch was the
ieading candidate, but failed of one or two
neces.-ary votes. The fight continued
until the end of the session and there was
no election.
"Two years ago Senator Doiph was the
leading candidate. He secured the caucus
nomination and it was supposed his re
election- was secure, but a few members
bolted the caut:us and refused to vote for
him. The result was a bHter fight until
the session was closing, -when McÃride,
an entirely new man, was elected on the
last ballot.
"The State Senate oreanized promptly
by electing Senator Siruon of Port
land president by unanimous vote. Mr.
Simon is an able and experienced legis
lator, and is generally conceded to be
without any superior as a political organ
izer and manager. He is the leader of the
gold standard Republicans and opposed
to Senaior Mitchell's re-election.
"The friends of Senator Mitchell en
deavored to prevent his election to the
presidency of the Senate, but fonnd him
so strong that opposition would be of no
avail and withdrew from* actively oppos
ing him.'' â 
ALBRECHT ACQUITTED.
Xo Cloud Upon the Uecord of a Long
and Honorable Life.
Frederick Albrecht, charged with com
plicity in a forrery, was acquitted by a
jury in Judge Carroll Cook's court yester
day.
Attorney Alexander Campbell, speaking
for the prisoner, drew the attention of the
jurors to the fact that Albrecht was an
old man vrho had pursued an upright,
industrious course through the many
years of his life; that he was manifestly
not connected with the alleged crime, ex
cept that Â«ome of tho witnesses thought
the defendant knew it was eoing to be at
tempted, but he denied the truth of the
charges.
This position was established to the sat
isfaction of the jury, and an acquittal fol
lowed. The deiendant was visibly af
fected upon the announcement of the ver
d.ct and decree of the court that he waa a
free man again.

burst into song, the faces of rhe vocalists
appearing in the center, and apparently a
part of the numerous flowers represented
on the canvas. Other unique features will
be introduced, and the novel programme
is expected to be a great success.

HEED INTO THE AIr.
An Unknown Man, .Evidently Insane,
Causes Excitement on Slitter Street.
A man about 28 years of age caused a
good deal of excitement on Sutter street,
between Jones and Taylor, ldst night
about 8 o'clock. He had a revolver in his
hand and fired three shots into the air.
.Policeman T. J. Bailey happened to be
near him and he rushed up to him, grab
bing hold of the revolver from behind.
The man wheeled round and pulled the
trigger, the bullet almost grazing Bailey's
side. After a desperate struggle Bailey
succeeded in wrenching the revolver from
the man and putting the handcuffs on
him.
As the man appeared to be insane he
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
placed in a padded cell. There were no
papers on him that could give a clew to
his identity. He is apparently a native of
France.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1897.
OFFICIAL HEADS
WERE PARED OFF
The Supervisors' Guillotine
Was in Smooth Work
ing Order.
There Were Hot Words, and
Talk About a "Solid Seven"
Slipped Out
Fish and Game Warden Was Dropped
by the Superyisors, but Two N w
O:fices Were Created.
The meeting of the Board of Super
visors yesterday afternoon was lively at
times. Mayor Pbel'an put in his first veto
against Order No. 3053, which prescribes
the same rules for plumbing to new and
old buildings alike, giving notice that the
Board of Health has proposed a new order
to meet the hardship to be worked by a
uniform rule. The Mayor also submitted a
communication recommending that the
Board should "declare vacant the office of
Fish and Game Warden in this City and
County, which cost the City and County
$1500 last year and yielded in fines only
$105, and his recommendation was carried
out then and there.
PhebÂ« A. Hearst gave an inkling of the
plans of the Hearst estate, by requesting
permission to alter and repair and add to
the Nucleus building with the proviso
that the total height of the building shall
not be made to exceed 150 leet.
A dozen or so of official beads fell, and
after the decapitations other incumbents
were placed in office. Up rose Supervisor
Clinton during these proceedings and said
that he did not lilce the way public busi
ness was being done. He declared that
there was a "solid seven" in the board
and that he had been told tnat a boss con
trolled the majority. Ud rose Supervisor
Kottanzi and denounced the statement
that the making of appointments then
under way was the work of a ring.
Whack! The gavel fell on Supervisor
Clinton's words as he was answering a
point of order made by Supervisor Shee
han that his remark- were personal.
Whachl whack 1 lell the g:.vel again as
Dr. Clinton responded: "My words may
be personal, but they are strictly true."
The gallery and lobby were filled with
interested and often grinning spectators.
One office was made permanently vacant,
but two new offices were created â the
office of historical cierk to the Committee
on Legislation, upon the recommendation
of Supervisor Britt, at an expense of $100,
the clerk to report to tne committee t.tie
papers of all bills at Sacramento affecting
the interest of San Francisco; also the
office of gardener of South Park at a
salary of $70 per month.
Heads fell around ttie City Hall very
lively. The following-named were elected
to fill tne positions designated, and every
such appointment meant a decapitation of
an incumbent: P. Willis, janitor of the
Justices' courts; Wiiliam A. Tobin, jani
tor of Police courts 2 and 3; Hermann
Armour, srardener of the new City Hall
grounds; James Hines, operator of ele
vator No. 2in the new City Hall; M. C.
Brophy, keeperof the Sixth-street dumps;
M. Doyle, fireman of the heating-rooui of
the new City Hall; "Edward Leonard, gar
dener of Hamilton square; John Cook
man, janitor of Department 12 of the Su
perior Court; Peter Moloney, keeper of
the Sixth-street bridge.
The head of the chief janitor in the new
City Hall, Dennis O'Callagban, fell in the
basket and T. J. O'Neil was elected to
take his place. While the appointments
were. going one striking and unusual imp:
pening illuminated the proceedings. Two
weeks ago J. J. Silvey, who had been a
janitor in the Tax Collector's office, was
removed and another placed in the posi
tion.
Yesterday Dr. Clinton made a plea for
the appointment of Silvey and told a
story about him. "He was crippled by
being badly injurea in a burning building
into which he went to rescue a friend and
he was badly distieured. He can only do
certain work. He has a wife and family."
Silvey sat inside of the railing in the lobby
and looked on at the proceedings with a
very anxious expression. After some
motions to reconsider and to postpone,
Silvey was rs-elected to fill the office
which he formerly occupied.
The hot words on the subject of a "solid
seven" occurred during tne election of
janitors and others, but there were hot
words later. The appointments were not
made without obstruction. Dr. Clinton
and Dr. Dodge took turns at suggesting
some other persous for the various offices
and insisted on a rollcall every time and
also put through a suggestion that some
Supervisors should vouch for every one
who was nominated.
Supervisor Britt. who moved for a his
torical clerk tor the Committee on Legisla
tion became, ruffled at a motion made by
Supervisor Haskins that an investigation
be made to see whether a bureau of infor
mation could not supply all the historical
information.
"Mr. Chairman," said Supervisor Britt
indignantly, "I move >s a substitute to
abolish the committee, on legislation."
This was put to a vote and was lost by 8
to 4 and Mr. Britt was pleased. Espe
cially so when Supervisor Dodge, who
originally mentioned the bureau of infor
mation, threw oil on the waters.
Dr. Dodge had stated that he thought
that the information desired could be se
cured for $5.
To fill tne new position of gardener of
South Park Thomas Clancy was ap
pointed, hi 3 pay of $70 per month to come
trom the Street Department fund.
Considerable routine business was trans
acted, which is summarized as follows: It
was voted that three nights before and
two nights after the full moon the streets
need not be lighted; voted to attend a
meeting at the Merchants' Exchange As
sembly Hall this afternoon to act with
others in favor of the construction of the
Nicaragua canal; voted to adopt the re
port of the Committee on Buildings, which
set forth that the janitorial work of the
new City Hall has been such as to give
rise to scandal, and that the work has not
compared well with the work in other big
buildings like the Crocker and Mills build
ings; voted to refer back to the â¢ Water
Committee several petitions for hydrants
in the Richmond district and elsewhere.
It was also voted to buy a Jot 19:6x80
feet, udjiiinng tne new engine-house on
Bryant street, for $500; to reconsider the
vote concerning the location of the Pest
house on the Almshouse tract; to appoint
a janitor and messenger, both being em
braced in one person, for the^ Mayor's
office; to permit Kohlberg, Strauss &
Frobman to extend their show-window 12
inches.
The sanitary condition of the City and
County Hospital was discussed at some
length. It sounded a little odd to hear
Supervisors say that the City would be
liable for damages on account of the
typhoid fever to be contracted in an insti
tution where peop'e go supposedly to get
cured; but Supervisor Clinton made this
statement. Supervisor Dodge said that
words could not express the situation.
The resolution to anate the nuisance was
passed to print unanimously. The cost of
making a better sewer system for the hos
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
pital will be between $2000 and $3000, ac
cording to the statement made to tl.e
board by the clerk, Mr. Russell. It was
voted to sell the horse and buggy at the
hospital, to expend $50 for laundry, ma
chinery and to have the steward remain
constantly at the hospital and to require
that all- demands issued by him be ap
proved by the superintendent.
A proposition to have the janitorial
work m the new City Hall done by con
tract was lost. It was voted to hold the
head janitor responsible for tb9 work of
all his subordinates and to increase his
powers.
The proposition to issue bonds for the
purpose of raising money to Improve the
streets and sewers came up in a com
munication from H. Levi and a long list
of other merchants and others, asking
that bonds be issued for a term of iorty
years, to carry 4 or 5 per cent interest per
annum.
Petitions were received from the West
ern Union Telegraph Company, the
Magdeburg Fire Insurance Company and
the Pacific Transfer Company to have cer
tain assessments declared erroneous and
duplicate as against them.
The Bank of California, San Francisco
Savings Union, the Frenc Bank, the Ger
man Bank and Daniel Meyer asked the
board to provide specifications for street
paving with California asphait in order to
give taxpayers the benefit of the competi
tion oi this material with other street
paving materials and in order to produce
the best paved streets at the least cost.

THE JURY DID NOT MEET
Postponed on Account of the
Death of the Wiie of Cap
tain Lees.
The Judge Campbell Investigation
May Be Taken Up To-Dayâ Fish
and Game Warden All Right.
The Grand Jury did not hold its special
session nxed for yesterday on account of
the death of the wife of Captain Lees.
Tne jury will meet to-day and go on with
its regular business. The special session
was called to hear evidence in the alleged
pencil-deed conspiracy.
It is net known whether this business
â will be taken up at to-day's session or not,
as other matters were scheduled for the
regular session, and it is more than likely
that a special day will be set for the
Cooney matter. However, this will prob
ably lie with Captain Lees himself.
The new Grand Jury has plenty of big
business on had for a young thing. It was
to nave taken up the investigation to-day
of Judge Campbeli's alleged habit of lear
iner jail releases about among the more
popular and convenient saloons, and will
do so unless the alleged conspiracy is
given precedence. The park commission
scandal in waiting its turn, and after that
tne straw-bond traffic in the policeconrts
wii) be reviewed, the Dockery scandal in
the Heal in Department and some half a
dc zen other uely-:ooking things in the
public service will be taken up, each in its
turn.
W. N. Brunt, chairman of the Health
Department committee, is preparing his
report on the FiÂ«h and Game Warden, as
called for by the foreman". The committee
vns instructed to tind out what the duties
of the Fish and Game Warden really are
and whether bis office was not one that
might well be dispensed with. Mr. Brunt
will report it as the opinion of the com
mittee that the officer earns his salary ;
that his inspection of the markets pre
vents the sale 01 fish and frame oul of sea
son, as well as otherwise guarding the
public health. It was found that he had
made a number of arrests during the past
year. It is likely therefore that a report
favorable to the officer will be made by
tne jury.
Burlesque Social.
A novel kind of social will be held next
Thnrsday evening by the Young People's So
ciety of Christian Endeavor connected with
the First Christian Church, on Twelfth street.
The. organizers of ihe entertainment announce
that they hnve engaged ;he most surprising
array of talent. Pailerewski, Ellen Beach
Yaw, Scalchi and a number of- other world
wide celebrities will appear â if not in person,
at least in burlesque representation. A re
markable male quartet is also promised, and
one solo is to be sung through a speaking
machine, which is warranted to be heard, a
mile away.

CHARLES SCHILL,
Residing at 263 Eighth Street, S. F.,
Relates the Story of His
Cure by
THE STATE
ELECTRO- MEDICAL
INSTITUTE.
TESTIMONIAL :
San Francisco, Cal.. i an. 14, 1897.
I, Chanes Schill, aged 30, residing at 262
EiKhth street, desire to testify to the benefit
and cure that I have experienced by treat-
ment at the STATE ELECTRO-MEDICAL IN-
STITUTE, corner of Powell, Market and Eddy
streets.
For four years I have been ailing with ner-
vous debility and heart and stomach trouble,
which greatly hindered me in my work as a
teamster, the business I have pursued for the
past seven years in San Francisco. I suffered
with pain and oppression of the chest, and
stomach, shortness of breath, flatulent dyspep-
sia and palpitation of the heart, and after ex-
ertion would feel weak and nervous. On
January 4, 1897, I applied, for treatment at
the INSTITUTE, where Dr. W. K. Vance made
a careful physical examination, found that my
heart and stomach were both disordered. I
was placed under treatment and at once began
to improve rapidly. and feel like a new num.
The doctor applied electricity and prescribed
certain electric fluids for internal use, also
magnetic oil for external application. These
remedies combined have had a magical- effect, '
and now, on January 14, I can truthfully say ;
that my health is fully restored. I am VERY
THANKFUL FOR SUCH A RAPID CUKE,
which enables me to pursue my daily work
without experiencing any exhaustion or wear-
iness. I may add thai I derive decided bene-
fit from wearing an Electrical waist appliance
prescribed by Dr. Vance.
Signed. . CHARLES SCHILL.

TO THE Y. M. I.
Metropolitan Temple Filled
by an Appreciative
Audience.
He Tcok for His Theme "The
Groundwork oi Our Lib
erties."
Many Prominent Members of the
Catho ie Frat -ma! Order Were
Seated Upon the Platform.
Metropolitan Temple was filled last
nichtto its seating capacity of 1800 per
sons, th â¢â¢ occasion being the annual lect
ure of Washington Council -No. 4, Young
Man's Institute.
The audience was ma^le up equally of
men and women. Tne principal speech
of the evening was delivered by Hon. M.
M. Estee of this City, whose theme was,
u The Groundwork of Our Liberties."
A number of musical selections were
rendered during the evening. The first
was. a piano prelude by Miss Marie
Gioreiani, a vocal solo by Mrs. F. L.
V," ratten, followed by a 'cello solo by Dr.
1 . l\e;:ensburger.
All were heartily applauded ana each
was followed by an encore. Miss Marie
Giorgiani also r;lay d a piar.o posilude.
The siape was strikingly decorated with
National flags and the cross-emblazoned
banners ot theY. M. I. Two large grace
fully draped silken rlatrs formed a central
backeround. Delicate white cheesecloth
covered with silver stars and caught up in
loops extended round the whole front of
the platform, just below a row of small
potted palms placed where footlights are
usually seen.
On the Mace were some thirty men
prominent in the Catholic fraternal order. !
Among them were: Father Peter C.Yorke;
Colonel James Smith, president of the Y.
M. I. of â¢ California; John Lync .., the ex
president; John Green, president of
Council No. 4; Peter Kretz, president
of Council No. 1; Dr. J. H. Morri-on,
James O'Donnell, James Larkin, John
Buddy, Chas. Cain, Frank I. Kierce. John
Caliauhan, John McLauphlin, K. J. Tobin,
P. Hyland, J. O'Brien, Dr. C. A. G over.
H. J. Cuells, R. A. Miller and Joseph
O'Donnell.
Some opening remarks were made by
Colonel James F. Smith, who as president
of the evening and as president of the
Y. M. I. briefly outlined the purposes of
trie organization.
He then introduced the Hon. M. M.
Estee, who, greeted by frequent applause,
spoke in part as follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It
has been sflid that "to gain an empire is easy
and common ; to govern it well is difficult and
rare indeed." However this may be, the binh
and childhood of a nation is t period of great
Â«i;d profound peril. The creation of a new
government by tree men is always perilous,
becausfe the conflicting and varying opinions
of people who think for themselves, the uncer
tainty of ihe result, the daager to the indi
vidual who rebels against established au
thorityâall conspire to make the first steps
toward statehood full of danger and grave
â¢vvith doubt.
The American Government was a growth,
nor a hurried creation. It did not spring into
<"2isterice iv a moment of exuberant patriot
ism, nor did tr>e battles of the Revolutionary
War; Bo bravely fought and won, alone estab-
I lish this Republic
The isolation and the solitude of life in the
voiceless woods made the early American get
tiers self-reliant. They nad little or no Gov
eminent. They needed none. They were ac
customed to no restraint and knew no law but
self-preservation. They soon began to feel
the-ir.own importance and to assert it. They
knew that in unity there was 6irength; and
while but few of the colonists asnired 10 Na
tional independence, all of them claimed to
tie, and really were, independent. The people
of trie Colonies were more opposed to foreign
rule than to the kind of rule they suffered.
. from the beginning new conditions con
fronted them. They were compelled to meet
these conditions by physical and intellectual
efforts, which were unparalleled in the his
tory of that age. Thus from necessity they ;
became inventors of new systems of govern
ment. They grew to greatness by the neglect
of England, not by its aid, and they thus owed
no debt of gratitude to the English King, and
when the ties which bound them were finally
severed they separated without regret.
Even before the Declaration of Independence
they had line experience in self-government,
lor they commenced at an early date to ho d
colonial congresses. In 1754 the drstof these
congresses was held at Albany, in the State ot
New. York, seven colonies only being reDre
bented. And the holding of these congresses
was continued from time to time until 1776,
when the Declaration of Independence was
â¢ made. The war of the Revolution was then in
evitable.
No living man can appreciate the dangers
that confronted the American people after
ipeace was declared. Up to the adoption of the
constitution, there was no National executive,
no Federal judiciary, no means of raising
money except by contribution of the States and
no power to en force equal contributions. Final
ly the Colonial Congress recommendea the
States to send delegates to a convention which
should "revise" the articles of confederation
and report to Congress and the several Legis
latures such alterations and provisions therein
| as should when agreed to in Congress and con
tinned by the States render the Federal con-
Miiuiion adequate to the existence of Govern
ment and the preservation of the Union. This
convention ruined the National constitution.
The first National Congress met in Â»New
York in 1789. It was a memorable occasion
in American history. It was opened with
prayer and it is reported that the stillness
which pervaded the vast audience gathered
around the few representatives who met there
' to legislate for the first time for the American
Ration was awe-inspiring. Old men wept
â with joy. Washington stood calm and serene
X â â¢! h ways, immobile in countenance and so-
V''--nie In convii:tiou. He had the great honor
Hki addressing Â»n American Congress for the
first time as President, and he was the only
President who ever personally addressed the
Congress of the United Slates. He carried
with him to that lofty position, not oniy the
love and affection of the Continental army,
but the confidence of the whole American
people. Neither sectional nor local strifes
could touch the universal confidence which
the peppie reposed in him.
The changes since then have been so mar
velous, our increase in wealth and population
has been so great, that the world wonders at
the phenomenal growth of this Republic, a
growth due largely to the lact that ever since
the adoption of our constitution this country
< has been the beacon light of liberty and thus
attracted to our shores a bold, hardy race of
men as immigrants. It has inspired no wars
for conquest, but to-day, through its wise and
peaceful counsels, it controls the govern
' mental policy of tne western continent. The
Monroe doctrine has thus become the doctrine
of peace.
. The United States was made one Nation by
the constitution, and yet the question whether
American nationality or State Â»>overeignty
should hold the mastery occupied the public
mind for many years. This was largely due to
the fact that the American colonies (afterward
the States of/ the Union) maintained local
governments long before the Union was cc- '
mented together into one Nation by the con
stitution. The people has thus become at
tached to their State before the United States
was in existence. For the first seventy years
of our constitutional history the problem of
State sovereignty, or State right*, was the
cause of most of the political divisions among
the people. Some leading statesmen claimed
to owe their first allegiance to their State and
not to the Nation. ' ~
The preamble of the National constitution
Rots this matter, however, at rest. It is the
iraost splendid phrasing of national principles
iuiat man has ever devised.
â¢ "We, the people of. the United States, in
Yrder to form a, more perfect Union, establish
jVstice, insure domestic .tranauillity, provide
lor the common defense, promote the general
welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and
establish this constitution for the United
States of America."
If that declaration did not make a nation
nothing could. -
,- To, secure the blessings of liberty in its
broadest sense ana to carry out the principles
enunciated in the preamble to the eonstitu
tton, the convention proceeded to make and
did make a constitu.ional declaration in
favor of religious liberty. In terms that ad
mit oi no mibconstruciio;i it prescribed:
"That no religious test Bliall ever be re
quired as a Qualification to any office or public
trust under tlie Uniied States." And further:
"That Congress shall make no laws respect
ing an establishment of religion or prohibit
ing the tree exercise thereof." The broad and
enlightened position thus assumed by our
foreiatbersou the question of religious liberty
is the more remarkable for the reason that
nearly every one of the colonies was originally
settled by gome religious sect, strong in lUowi
convictions and unbending In its prejudices.
And yet, when the representatives of these
met to make a constitutional law for them
selves and for future generations they forgot
their creeds aud legislated for all men and all
creeds, aud thereby engrafted upon the Ameri
can constitution the most sublime principles
of complete religious freedom. 1 his declara
tion did more toward buiiuing up this great
Republic thau any other one principle made
prominent in turn chartered liberty By in
viting to our shores the people of ail faiths it
made Amer;ca the asylum of those who loved
God and wished to worship him according to
the dictates of their conscience; and it af
lorded additional proofs to tne world thai
the Americnn people by defending religious
liberty would perpetuate civil liberty, for the
security oi the one is the perpetuation of the
Nowhere in the constitution is the name of a
Supreme Beim to be found, and yet every sen
timent of thÂ»t constitution teaches the princi
ples which Chris. ianity inculcates. And so
America has sought to teath oiner and differ
ent lemons from those incu cated by the earlier
Civilizations. Nay, within a month, this Repub
lic has adopted a treaty of arbitration with
England, wherein the differences between
these nations, should any arise, shall be nettled
upon ttie principle of equity and justice and
uot Dy the aroitrnmet oi arms. America has
thus shown that natious, iike men, should set
t.c their differences by peaceful Wians, for the
time is fast approaching '-when nation shall
not lift sword iigainst uatiou; neither shall
they learn war any more."
My iriends, therf ure dangers confronting
this Republic, as there Hre dangers commut
ing every nation, some of which it Is lolly to
disregard or puss unnoticed. Safety rests in
knowing our mistake^ and correcting them.
MRS. BELLE NAVA.
Whenever virtue ceases to be a substance in
American affairs this great KepuDlic will fall
to pieces, because the virtue and intelligence
of the people is the rock upon which this Gov
ernment staads. When either wealth, igno
rance or corrupt political ambition supplants
virtue and honest intelligence in the policy of
this Nation this great Republic will be in
dancer.
There are other perils, however, imper.-ding
ovor our country, ana these are of a political
nature. The saiety and the perpetuity of this
Nation depends largely upon the wisdom, the
stability and the purity of American politics.
If we maintain pure politics we will have pure
government. But when the American people
shall become so imbued with factional political
sentiments as to be willing to risk the Nation
forlthe success of a party or a cause, then the
onn'.ry will be in danger.
Remember always that nothing can survive
the loss ot liberty. With its loss will fall all
that civilization holds dear. II we wish to
cunt'nue this Republic in the course marked
out by the constitution we must maintain the
moral sentiments of the people. If we would
perpetuate the principles ot freedom and sus
tain American institutions we must cultivate
a patriotic devotion to our country. Then the
temple of liberty built by our fathers will
stand through time untouched by vandal
hands, but the great mission of the American
Nation will tie accomplished only when lib- !
erty, regulated by law, shall be the inspiring
principle of all the nations ot the earth.
THE HMD OF FELLOWSHIP
Singular Death of a Member of
Sargent Lodge, Order of
Oid Fellows.
At the close of the installation of the
officers of Sargent Lodge No. 368, I. O. O.
F., by District Deputy Grand Master Mer
schon and his staff, Frank E. Smith, the
retiring noble grand, was presented a
handbome past grand's jewel in token of
the esteem in which he is held by the
members of the lodge. After the presen
tation and the transaction of routine busi
ness there was an informal smoker, and
all the members had a general eood time.
Short but interesting addresses were made
by the district deputy and visiting Odd
Fellows.
At a meeting of this lodge held last night
one member was admitted by a deposit of
card and two were initiated, the work be
ing done in a creditable manner by Noble
Grand A. P. Ely, assisted by the other
officers of the lodge.
This lodge was organized about six years
ago and was named for the late Aaron A.
Sargent, who was a United States Senator
from California. Its rise has ben re
markable, and it has increased in the
point of membership and finance in a
manner that la cnditabft to those who
have had its advancement at heart. It
has to its credit in bank nearly $7000. The
officers and members nave the credit of
dome ail in their power to make their
meetings interestine and instructive. At
its last held meet ng the sum of $75 was
ordered paid to the mother of one of its
members, who died six hours after reach
ing his mother's home in tne East. The
excitement and joy of meeting his mother,
from whom he had been separated for
many years, brought on an attack of
apoplexy, which caused his death. Reso
lutions of condolence were ordered for
warded to Ins mother.

THE SAN, FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY JANUARY 19, 1897.
THREE ASSAULTS
UPON WOMEN
A Servant-Girl and Two
Married Women the
Victims.
Brutal Attack Upon Mrs. Mary
E. Markey by Thres Mid
dlfAged Men.
Petriona Quinones Wounded E v n
Times and Mrs. Belle Nava Is
Beaten, Choked and Bruised.
It lias been frequently remarked in po
lice circles that when a crime out of the
usual run of offenses is committed it is
generally followed very soon by two
others of a similar nature. Such a coinci
dence happened within a few hours on
Saturday night and early yesterday morn-
Injr.
The first, which was briefly referred to
in yesterday's issue, was the case of
Petriona Quinones, a servant girl em
ployed in a lodging-house at 1008 Van
Ness avenue. She had retired to rest and
was awakened by a loud knocking at her
bedroom door. On inquiring what was
wanted Herman Colin, a son of the pro
prietor of the lodging-house, told her he
wanted to see her.
"1 refused to open the door," she said
yesterday, "and he bepged me to do it
just for a minute. 1 got up and opened
the door. I saw be had beeji drinking,
but before I could shut the door he thrust
himself in the room.
"He said he would fix me in two min
utes for showing favors to Nathan, his 15
--year-old brother, and asked me for the
rat poison his mo her had bought, saying
that he and I would swallow it and die
together. I told him I did not know
where it was, and then he pulled a knife
FETRIONA QUINONES.
out of his pocket and began to stab me
with it.
"I screamed for help and seized the
knife with my left hand and tried to
wrench it from him, but I could not do it
and he continued to stab me. I ran
screaming out of the room and knocked ct
two doors calling for help, but no one
answered.
"I was afraid Herman would renew his
assault upon me, but on going back to
mv room I found he was not there. I
threw on my dress and ran to a doctor in
the next block, but be would not attend
to me, and then 1 met a policeman and
was taken to the hospital."
Dr. Fitzgibbon found three wounds on
her back, a deep wound in her abdomen
and six wounds on her left band. It took
him a considerable time to stitch ana
dress the wounds.
Herman Cohn called at the Central Po
lice Station about 1 o'clock yesterday
morning and surrendered himself, ac
knowledping that he had done the stab,
bing. He was under the influence of
liquor, and refused to say why be bad at
tempted to murder the woman. He was
taken to the hospital and the woman
identified him. He was then taken to the
City Prison and a charge of assault to
murder was booked against him. The
right wrist Dand of his shirt was covered
with blood, and it was cut off aud will be
held as evidence aerainst him.
The woman is 28 years of age, and has
been in this City for the past six years.
She gave birth to an illegitimate child
about a year before coming to this Uity.
She had been a servant in the Conn lodg
ing-house for the past two months, and
acknowledged to having bestowed her
favors upon the boy Nathan and his
brother Herman, and that the latter was
actuated by jealousy in making the mur
derous attack upou her. The wounds are
not dangerous.
Mrs. Mary E Markey was the victim of
a brutal assault about the same time as
the Quinones. woman. She lives at 1116
Folsom street, her husband, Charles A.
Markey, being an engineer on the water
front. She had been visiting her mother
at 727 Clementina street Sunday night and
left to return home shortly after 11
o'c ock.
As she was passing a stable at 374 Isa
toma street a men who was standing at
the door accosted her in German and
asked her to come into t c stable. With
out deigning to reply she pushed past him
and he grabbed hold of her, forcing her
toward the door. He placed his hand on
her mouth to prevent her frini screaming
and when they pot to the door it was
opened by two men who were inside.
She was carried upstairs to a room in
the rear of the stable. She was kept there
for half an hour and tlie man who accosted
her on the street maltreated her and at
tempted to criminally assault her. He
struck her in the f.tce and tried to choke
her, but she fought desperately and baf
fled the efforts of the ruffian. Then he
began to plead with her to live with him.
During the strugglw her purse contain
ing $3 15 was taken from her pocket and a
gold ring lrom her finger.
She finally succeeded in making her
escape, and she rushed home and told her
husband of her treatment. He seized a
butcher-knife and was hurrying in the
direction oi the stable when he met Police
men T. F. Burke and McEntee. They
accompanied him to the stable and tound
the three men. They were taken to Mrs.
Markey's Louse and she identified them.
The man who accosted her is Gus Sor
ger, a teamster, 52 years of age, and be
was charged with robbery and an attempt
to commit a criminal assault. The other
two men are Fred Gerhardy, a cook, 40
years of age, and William Roderwalu, a
laborer, 43 years of age. They were each
booked on a charge of robbery. The
policemen returned to th' room in the
stable and found the purse and the ring.
The prisoners were arraigned in Judue
Conlan's court yesterday morning.
Mr?. Markey is confined to bed from the
shock to her nervous system, and was too
ill to appear in court yesterday.
The third victim was Mrs. Belle Nava,
the wife of a barber living at 325J^ Bush
street. According to her story sue was
accosted on the street by three young
men, who suggested that she should ac
company them. She knew one of them
and walked along with them until they
came to a building at Fourth and Howard
streets, where Dr. Swain has a dental
office.
They asked her to go upstairs with
them, but she declined, and two of them
carried her up to the dental office by main
strength. There they choK d and beat
her and tried to criminally assault her.
Policeman James Cook and W. Meyer
were notified of the affair and they raided
the place. They met Ellis Swain, a son
of Dr. Swain, coming downstairs and he
was placed under arrest. Proceeding to
the dental office they found tho woman
on a lounge and James Muivey beside her.
She was under the influence of liquor.
Her clothing was torn and there were
marks of violence on her arms and throat.
Swain and Mulvey, who cave the name
of Wilson, and the woman were taken to
the City Prison. The two young men
were pooked on a charce ol attempt to
commit a criminal assault and the woman
for being drunk. Subsequently R. J.
Thomas, an ex drnmmer, who was with
Swain and Muivey, was arreftud and
booked for disturbing the peace. He did
not go upstairs to the dental office, but
remained outside. Thomas pleaded guilty
in Judze Joacbimsen's court yestÂ« rday
and was ordered to appear for sentence
to-day. The other two were arraigned.
Muivey is a clerk in an attorney's office
and is a brother of Thomas M'ulvey, a
Deputy County Clerk.
The two young men's story differs from
that of the woman. They said they were
in Abbott's saloon on Grant avenue, near
Post street, when the woman came ud to.
them and said her lorer had beat n her
She snowed bruises on her arms and throat
Â°and said that she was afraid to go home,
as he might go there and kill her, and she
asked if they would take care of her.
Tney had two or three drinks with the
woman and took her to the dental rooms
so that she coulJ stop there all night. She
complained ol being hungry and it was
while he was out to get some sandwiches
for her that Swain says he was arrested by
tne policemen. They positively denied
that they attempted to criminally assault
her and cannot understand why she should
make such a charpe ae-ainsr them.

WHERE OIL FLOWS
FROM HILLSIDES
Character of the Petroleum
Fields of Southern
Counties.
Watts of the State Mining
Bureau Tells of His
Investigations.
Cattle Stick Fast and Die in Warm
Asphaltum Like Fus on
Flypap-r
The oil resources of California are being
carefully investigated by the State Mining
Bureau, which looks for a great develop
ment some day of the oil industry along
the slopes of the Coast Ranj;e from San
Francisco southward almost to the Mexi
can border iine. The recent extensive
explorations made in ihe southern part of
the State by W. L. Watts of the Mining
Bureau lormed the subject of an interest
ing popular lecture given last night before
the Academy uf Sciences.
The discourse was made additionally
entertaining by a stereopticon display of
about 200 v.ews ol the oil wells, bitumin
ous deposits and petroleum-bearing re
gions visited by the lecturei.
One of the views showed an asphaltum
flow in which were sticks and stones and
bones of animals. Sometimes, the lec
turer explained, cattle lie down in ibe as
pbaltnm when it is warm; they never get
up again. At other times, on warm days,
cows attempt to walk through the soit
black stuff, but they stay in it until they
are rescued or until they die.
In some localities, particularly in the
Sespe oil regions of Ventura County,
horizontal tunnels have been bored into
the precipitous hillsides in search of oil
flow. The gas accompanying the oil de
posit makes life in the tunneis impossible
without a constant blast of fresn air sent
in by water pressure.
Some of the tunnels are lighted by in
candescent electric lights. Others are
lighted simply by an ordinary mirror, op
erated by a man on the outside, so that
the sun's rays are reflected straight into
the tunnel. By tbis simple means light
may be thrown in a di-uauce of 1000 feet,
ai a with such power that ordinary news
paper print may be read by a person at
toe far end of the tunnel.
During his discourse Mr. Watts, when
describing the commercial aspects of his
scientific explorations, spoke in substance
as follows:
The minerals of Californfa consist not only
ot most; irom which metals are obtained, but
also of numerous other substances which
are constantly becoming in greater demand
as civilization advances and as the arts and
manufactures are further developed. Th c most
important of the latter class of minerals are
tlioÃe known as the hydrocarbons. They are
formed of the elements of njdrogeu and
carbon. They furnish light and ' heat
and are utilized in many different ways
which contribute 10 man's comtort and well
being.
The hydrocarbon minerals treated in this
lecture are the petroleums.
Researches in various parts of the world
have led to the conclusion that petroleum de
posits may be divided into two classes, namely,
primary and secondary deposits. The primary
deposit is contained by the rocks in wnich ihe
petroleum was formed or originally accumu
lated. The secondary deposit is formed when
petroleum wanders from strata in which it
originally accumulated and finds a resting
place in other rocks which are favorable to its
storage.
Primary deposits have been found to belong
to definite geological horizons; that is to say,
the rocky strata containing such deposits
have a definite position with regard to the
other rocks which have been formed before
and after them, and which, tHkcu together
with the petroleum-yielding rocks, constitute
a geological series in the localise* where such
deposits of petroleum are found. Such oil
yielding strata are conformable to all the
other strata included withiu their geological
horizon, and frequently the oii-yielding rocks
can be traced 1 oin mountain to mountain
wherever the characteristic rocks representing
their geological horizon are exposed.
The secondary deposits are, in the nature of
their occurrence, erratic and local. In some
cases it is difficult to distinguish primary from
secondary deposits, but when rocks belonging
to a certain geological horizon are found to be
oil-bearing, not only in one place, but on
different lolds and in different localities, it
may be assumed that such oil-oearlug rocks
belong to a primary deposit of petroleum.
Another important question is that of the
structure of the rocks which has resulted in
the accumulation of petroleum in valuable
quantities. The characteristic structure of
the formations is that oi cioseiy compressed
anticlinal lolls. By fir the greatest number
of remunerative wel s penetrate the rocks
which iorm the upper portion of t !i ese folds.
During the year 1895 about 1,250,000 bar
rels of oil were produced in CnLfornia. Of
this amount very nearly 1,000,000 barrels
were produced in Los Angeles County, and
something less than 250,000 In Ventura
County. It Is probable that the yield for 1896
will not fall very far short of this amount.
The geologica. horizon of the oil-yielding
rocks in tne southern part of California is as
follows:
About Los Ange'es, pliocene; and in thÂ«
Puente district, older than pliocene. Tne
petroleum deposits north of the valley of the
Santa Clara River, in Ventura County, consist
of dark-coiored shales and soft sandstone de
posited between the eocene and miocene pe
riod, and rocks deposited during the eocine
period. The geological horizon of the oil
yielding rocks at Summer-lam 1 ,, Santa Barbara
County, has yet to be determined.
The L >s Angeles oil and the Summerlanrl oil
is heavy ; its principal value is for fuel. It is
usual. y estimated that from three and a half
to four barreU oi it have a fuel value equal tr>
that of aoout one ton ot good bituminous coal.
M> st of th.' Ventura County oil is much
lighter than the Los Angeles and Summe;
land oil. It is handled by the Union Oil Com
pany, which has a refinery at Oleum, Contra
Costa County.
The oil irom the Puente wells and from the
weHs of the Pacific Const Oil Company, near
Newha.l, in Los Angeles County, is still lighter
than the Ventura County oil. The Puente oil
is refined by the Puente Oil Company, which
hHS its works at Chino, in San Bernardino
founty. The Pico Canyon oil is refined by the
Pacific Coast and the Slur 0.1 Company at its
works in Alameda County.
PrOPoSEd MINING LAWS
Fighting for a Commission to
Pass on the Nature of
Lands.
Miners" Association Preparing an Act
Relative to Acquiring M ning
Rirhts
The miners of the Srate are watching
Congress with a keen interest to see what
action will be taken upon the several min
ing measures now before the Rational
lawmakers. One in particular is House
bill 4080, providing for a commission to
determine upon the mineral or non
mineral nature of land in railroad grants.
A. H. Rickett*, chairman of th^- commit
tee of mineral lands of the association,
has sent letters to all the Pacific Coast
members in Congress upon this matter,
uraing them by voice and vote to do all
in their power to carry the bill.
Several have sent replies. One from
Senator George V. Perkins says that he
will give the matter his careful considera
tion. Congressman Eugene F. Loud in
his answer, said: "I have in the past
and shall continue to use such influence
as is in my power to further the measure."
Congressman Hartmann made a similar
promise. Senator Stephen M. White also
promises to do what he can, but he throws
cold water over the matter by adding in
conclusion: "If Mr. Reed would consent
to its preseniation to the House it
would undoubtedly pass; but 1 am very
much afraid that he will refrain from
favorable action. lam doing my utmost
to force it through. " The answer of Sen
ator George W. McÃride shows that the
measure has friends, for he writes as fol
lows: -.
* * * In reply I have to say that I am a
member of the Committee on Public Lands tnat
condemned the bill at the last session. As
your letter states, the bill was amended so as
to include Oregon in its provisions, and the
members ol the Oregon delegatiun in Congress
are unanimous in its support and very anxious
that the bih shouid pass tne House of Kepre
sentaiives at the present session.
The executive committee of the associa
tion is not overlooking the State La isla
ture and before tne session is over will
have prepared a number oJ measures ihat,
it is believed, will be of gre>t benefit to
the miners of the State. One matter
which ia of more than usual interest re
lates to the acquisition of mining rights
upon public domain. The committee to
which this mailer was given to irame an
act was instructed to confine the proposed
law to the following purposes:
The enactment of a law providing for the
recording of notices of location, and making
bucii notice when recorded prima facie evi
dence of the facts therein recited.
The enactment of a law ailuwing the dis
coverer of a lode claim sixty days irom the
date of liis discovery to perfect his location
and mark ais boundaries.
The enactment 01 a 1- w providing for the de
posit wiih the County Recorder ot the several
counties of all district recoris heretofore ex
leiin !, making euca County Recorder the legal
custodian ot such records and authorizing
copies certified to by such recorder to be ad
mitied in evidence, with like eft' ct as ii cer
tified to by tne original custodian of such

The Anti-Saloon Influence.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 18.â At a meet
ing o; the Trustees the liquor license of
A. Franck was revoked at the request of a
committee of the Anti-Saloon League.
They charged him with seling or giving
liquor to a daughter of X.. H. Fallmath
and others. A secret session of the board
waa held several weeks ago, but no idea of
the verdict was out. This is tte
first case the league has attempted to deal
with, and will serve as a lesson to the pub
lic as to what may be expected of them.

NEW TO-DAT.
THEY KNOW.
Opinions of Some Skillful Chicago
â¦ Physioiana.
The new article now being used in place
of coffee has made many friends, and it
may interest these friends and others to
know the opinion of some of the well-
known physicians of Chicago on the sub-
ject. The following are extracts from a
lew of their letters now on lile in the office
of the Fostum Cereal Co., Lim., at Battle
Creek, Mich.:
Dr. G. E. Bass., So. Chicago, lll. : "I have
tried Postum and was well enough pleased
that I would like to use more of it. Kindly
inform me where it can be obtained in this
locality."
Dr. Almond Brooks. 21 Quincy street,
Chicago, 111.: "The test I have made of
Postum makes me think I can use it in
practice as a substitute for coffee, the use
of which I daily prohibit."
Dr. Wrn. Bonart, Emerald aye. and 43d
st., Chicago, III. : "Your Postum I have
tried and like it very much."
Dr. Joseph P. Cobb, "Tue Clinique," 3156
Indiana aye., Chicago: "Your sample of
Fostum is received and brewed. It is
pleasant, and when a substitute for coffee
is desired will, I believe, be of value."
Dr. Archibald Church, attending physi-
cian to St. Luke's Hospital, Professor of
Nervous Diseases, Chicago Folyclinic and
Home for Crippled Children, Pui man
Bidg., Chicago, in a letter to the Postum
Cereal Co.. Lim., Battle Creek, Mich. : "I
nave made a trial of Postum and think it
will serve admirably as a substitute for
coffee for those who are accustomed to use
sugar in that beverage."
There are many more letters of a like
character from prominent physicians in
all parts of America expressing their
thanKs for the help gained and to be
gained by their patients in the use of the
health coffee, "Postum.''
There is but one genuine original Postum
Cereal coffee, wit'i a multitude of imita-
tions off erf das "just good."

A TIMELY TOPIC.
What the Leading Papers Say About the
Great Danger of These Days. â¢
The leading question of the day among
scientific men and in tne leading papers is
tne alarming increase of pneumonia, the
death rate showing an increase of over
FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT within
the last few years. , Doctor Gouverneur
M. Smith, in an article in the Medical
Record, says that while medical art has
advanced of recent years in many direc
tions, "so far as pneumonia is concerned
science has shriveled." The New York
Sun, writing on this subject, says: "The
great increase in the fatality of pneumonia
is very alarruintr, especially as the disease
carries off so many in the fullness of life
and health." The New York Herald
says: "Considering the impending weather
changes, this dread disease opens its cam
paign very vigorously." Surgeon-General
Moore of the army in his annual recort
says: "The principal cause of death in the
army is pneumonia." #
There is one thing that every doctor,
every surgeon and every nurse does upon
the first appearance of pneumonia, and
that is to stimulate the system. The life
is weakened and must be stimulated to
throw off this â . terrible disease. Puro
j spirits do this; imiure spirits do not.
The amount of Duffy's pare malt whiskey
used by the doctors and nurses in the
land in case of pneumonia is enormous
Great care should be exercised in securing
the genuine, and great promptness in
taking it oh tbe approach of the first
symptom*.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flgurat
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect, popi s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hfeh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: -Mow"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather'and rain?.
"Lows" us. ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the cons;, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low It inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lmprob
nble. Wlih a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, find
(he pressure falling to the California" coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
â¢111 produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18.-Tbe opening
deals at the Stock Exchange were characterized
by firmness. Trading was on an unusually large
scale, and commission-houses, for the first time In
a month or so. transacted a good share of the
business. Higher cables from London and foreign
purchases of St. Paul added to the bullish feeling.
The great abundance of money, the steady in
crease lv the treasury gold holdings and the mas
nificent trade statement just issued by the Bureau
of Statis ics continued to be the moving causes.
The rise during tbe first hour of trading was equal
to %@2 per cent, Lackawi-.ua, Jersey Central,
Erie first prefened Sugar, .Manhattan and
Grangers leading The demand for stocks abated
during the atterÃOon and at the same time the
buyers began to reduce their loans. There was a
decline of Kg,;-, 1.4 per cent, Manhattan leading
with sales as low us 903,4.. Wheeling and Lake
.trie preferred dropped from VÂ±@li4 on light
dealings.
The heaviness of the bituminous coalers Is due
to the unsatisfactory condition or the trade,
which, it Is be ieved, will necessitate heroic action
of the managers of those companies to restore the
business to a paying basis. A meeting of the
roads interested will be held this week and the re
sult of the conference is awaited with no little In
terest h,- Wail street. Sugar jumped to 118 at tbe
opening and later settled back to 116. There
were no new developments in the coffee war, but
the op nion still preva.ls that the light will be car
ried on with vigor for some time to come. In
Rome quarters the afternoon selling was attributed
in part to Kentucky bank failure*. Humors were
also current of embarrassments in uptown busi
ness circles, but the reports could not be con
firmed.
A story which gained currency for a time was to
the effect that there would be no dividend on ;
Nickel Plate first, preferred stock this year. It
was subsequently slated that no action will be
taken on the matter until the latter part of Febru
ary and that all talk on this matter is (he merest
SID. .
The umaba people to meet shortly to declare
a dividend on common. In the opinion of the
street It will be 'd per cent. Speculation closed
weak in tone. Net changes show loses of 14Â®
1% per cent. Total sales were 301,968 snares.

CHICAGO MAKKKTS,
CHICAGO, It!,. Jan. 18.â The business in tne
wheat market was slow to-day, and a very slight
advance was gained by her bulls or bean,
simply because the trade was too light to make
much of an lmpresUon on prices. Liverpool again
showed disinclination to sympathize with Ameri
can markets, cables quoting but Vi'l advance,
whereas we made */Â± Of a ceut improvement on
Satnrday. The world's shlpmen s were light at
4,600,000 bushels. Liverpool stocks decreased
37,000 bushes. Receipts in the Northwest were
fair at 313 curs, against 361 last Monday and 652
a year ago. Chicago received 25 curs and In
spected 119,387 cusheis.
The amount on ocean passage decreased 720,000
bushels. This was adecrease in the visible supply
of 1,413.000 bushels Closing Paris cables were
higher, Berlin lower and Antwerp unchanged. The
feeling became weak as the session progressed,
prices fa ling away about, a cent from the opening.
Export cleara ces amounted to 181,932 bushels
The English visible supply increased 371.000

COKNâ A f<tiny good business was transacted
in corn during the first hour of the session, but '
the effort at activity seemed to exhaust the trade
and a lifeless appearance was again noted. Liver
pool cables were unchanged. Receipts were SSI
cars. There were no withdrawals from store.
The amount on ocean passage increased 640,000
bushels- The tone of the market was firm early.
Later the fee Ing altered in sympathy with wheat,
prices receding. The visible supply increased
996.000 bushels. Exports amounted to 292.095
Dushels. In erior offerings of corn are reported

were heavy this morning they were nevertheless
short of anticipations. The prices at me yards
under the circumstances opened steady, later ad
vancing. Product was affected by toe informa

This was due to the large world's stock of that
commodity. At the close May pork was 2Va(<sSc 1

CONVENTIONS
Republicans Meet, Organize,
Appoint Committees
and Adjourn.
Talcott Made Chairman, Which
Points to the E ection of
Thomas as Mayor.
Populists Elect Hitchcock Chairman,
but Being I 1 He Withdrew and
Gregg Was Chosen.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. IS.â Only two
delegates were absent when Chairman
Fred Campbell called the Republican con
vention to order to-night. After a short
tribute to President-elect McKinley, nom
inations for temporary chairman were de
clared in order.
H. D. Talcott, W. G. Manuel and J. R.
Scupbam were placed in nomination.
The voting was very lively. Talcott and
Manuel ran close, and there was some
surprise that the Seventh Ward should
V.ot have gone solid for Manuel, its vote
/ ig, Manuel 12, Talcott 8. This placed
f , . ott in the lead, and then the Fourth
*Ward withdrew Scupham and swung 21
votes to Talcott. The name of Manuel
ts as withdrawn amid great cheering, and
T&lcott's election was made unanimous.
A. W. Bishop, the secretary without
whom no Republican convention would
be complete, was again appointed to that
position, and a young man named Cotton
was appointed assistant secretary.
Chairman Talcott |tnen announced that
the appointment of committees was in
order, and one member from each ward
was appointed by the delegation.
The committee on credentials named
wasâ C. W. Kellogg, I. I. Boak, F. M.
Walsh, Dr. H. B. Carleton, J. A. Beckwith,
Y. Kahn, A Kayser.
On permanent organization and order
of businessâ H. 0. Trow bridge, M. D.
Merrick, E. A. Heron, \V. F. Pierce, C. C.
Lombard, I. H. Henderson, H. L. Nash.
On platform and resolutionsâ C. BuTk
halter, A. H. Breed, W. G. Manuel, P. E.
Daniels, C. D. Vincent, Dr. W. J. Wilcox,
Victor H. Metcalf.
After tiie recess the committee on ere- !
dentials reported in favor of the delegates j
callÂ«d by the secretary, with a few substi
tutes. The report on permanent organiza
tion and order of business reported the
following:
That the temporary officers be made
permanent; that the order of nominations
be as follows: Mayor, Auditor, Treasurer
and Tax Collector, City Engineer, " City
Attorney, four Councilmen at Large, four
School Directors at Large, five Library
Trustees, ward nominations for Council
rnen, ward nominations for School Direc- j
tors, one City Committeeman from each !
ward.
The committee on platform and reso
lutions chose Walter G. Manuel as chair
man, and when called upon to report he
said that the time allowed them, fifteen j
.minutes, was altogether too sbort in j
which to frame a piatform for the Repub
lican candidates to pledge themselves by
fcftivA asked for iurther time.
As nothing further could be done the
| vention adjourned till to-morrow
at.
The vote for chairman of the convention I
practically settled the vote for Mayor. H. !
D. Talcott, the G. A. R. man, showed that
the convention's cnoice would be for W. i
R. Thomas, and as soon as this was seen
Auditor Snow at once announced that he
was a candidate to succeed himself only,
"as he has always been." As Mr.
Snow had been unable to tell what office
he was seeking before the convention
met the public did not quite understand
what kind of a candidate he "always had
been," but they know now. He will prob
ably be nominated for Auditor, and it
seems certain that W. R. Thomas, the G.
UNCLE JOE DILLON, for Twenty-Five Years City Assessor of
Oakland, Who Died Yesterday.
A. R. candidate for Mayor, will have a
walkover for the nomination.
The Fifth Ward caucused to-niÂ£?ht and

HONEST IN PUBLIC LIFE.
Death of "Uncle Joe" Dillon
After a Long, Active
Career.
Was Assessor tf the City of Oakland
for Twenty-F ye Years Con
secutively.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. )
"Uncle Joe" Dillon died this morning at
his home on Linden street. Although the
immediate cause of death was paralysis
he has been failing for some time, and his
demise was partly due to old ase.
Joseph M. Dillon held the record for
having served a greater number of years
consecutively in office than any other
man in the State. In 1864 he was elected
City Assessor and the following twenty
four annual conventions nominated him,
and in each case he was re-elected.
In 1559 "Uncle Joe" met his defeat In
thai year the tj rst election waa i eld under
the new charter add Dillon was beaten by
R. W. Snow, who has held the office *Â»ver
since. After his defeat Dillon was given
a place in the Mint, which he retained till
a few months ago.
Joe Dilion came from New York State,
where he was born seventy-five years ago.
He settled in this county in pioneer
times auu was one of the very best known
men in public life in Oakland. He has
been many years a widower and leaves
two children, Miss Kate, who kept hia
trome on Linden street, and Malachi,
named after his uncle, Malachi Fallon,
who was one of the earliest officials of
San Francisco.
"Uncle Joe" was equally well known for
his open-hearted generosity and his love
of the humorous aide of life. One of his
practical jokes will live for years, although
it occurred more than two decades ago.
In the noon hour two men were noticed
to be fighting desperately on the top of
the Cameron block, now known as the
Athenian Club building. Joe stood on
the City Hall steps calling attention to
the battle, and he very soon succeeded in
gathering a crowd of not less than a
thousand people. The combatants ap
proached very near the railing on the side
of the roof, and to the horror of the crowd
they saw the larger of the two fignters lift
the other from his feet and hurlhim over
the railing to the sidewalk below.
The crowd at once rushed across Four
teenth street to inspect the crushed man,
when they made the discovery that it was
only a very cleverly made dummy. At
this stage of the proceedings "Uncle Joe"
called their attention to the fact that it
was April Fool day.
Joe was a politician and knew how .to
humor a convention. On one occasion,
when several candidates had made
speeches of stupid length to the delegates,
Joe made a record.
"lam a member of a society," he said,
"that has for its object the prevention of
cruelty to animals. I thank you for the
nomination." Joe then retired, and the
relieved "animals" cheered lone and
lustily.
The funeral of the deceased will take
place to-morrow morning from the Church
of Bt. Francis de Sales.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1897.
THEY EXCHANGE
PRACTICAL IDEAS
Agriculturists Attend the
State Farmers' Institute
at Livermore.
Valentine Alviso Tells of Early
Farming in Pioneer Days
in California.
Professor Connell Believes That a
Farmer's Education Should Begin
at High School.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. j
The Farmers' Institute, which is being
held under the auspices of the University
Specimen of Tobacco Plant Grown in Alameda County Now on
Exhibition at the State Farmers* Institute at LivermoreÂ«
E. G Hahn Has Made a Specialty of Tobacco-Growing;.
of California, convened this morning at
the Masonic Hall in Livermore.
There was a large attendance for the
opening day, and many people from Oak
land and all the surrounding towns were
present.
The hall is very tastily decorated by the
ladies' auxiliary of the Livermore League
of Progress and by the league. Vine and
olive culture, cattle-feeding and creamery
products and many other allied industries
were represented, but perhaps the most
interesting feature was the exhibit of
tobacco culture by E. C. Hahn, who has
spent considerable time in experimenting
with tobacco plants in this county.
E. S. Adams, the well-known agricul
tural writer, opened the proceedings with
a paper in which he showed clearly the
relation of the State University to the
farmer. The various experiments made
at the university and the data which are
there compiled and sent out were touched
upon, and the speaker expressed the
opinion that the farmers did not fully ap
preciate or are not aware of the vast
amount of benefit they can receive by
taking advantage of the university experi
ments. He showed that a very small per
centage of the farmers of the State take
the trouble to place themselves in com
munication with the univeisity, and thus
rob themselves of the resuitant advan-
tages.
A. P. Hayne dealt with resistant vines.
He has spent many years in practical
vine-crowing and spoke with authority of
his experience. According to his data,
there is a great deal of loss incurred by
growers because they do not attach suffi
cient importance to the scientific feature
of their business. He stated that it is not
sufficient to put vines in the ground and
to expect them to grow and produce fine
grapes unless the conditions of soil and
climate and the nature of the vines are
studied and care is taken to protect tljem
from the ravages of insects and weather.
The culture of olives was the theme of
J. M. Doty's paper. Mr. Doty is one of
the best known olive - growers in the
county, and he handled the â subject in an
interesting and practical manner and con
vinced the audience that his conclusions
were a result oi useful experience.
Valentine Alviso, the beat known
pioneer rancher in Livermore Valley, read
a paper which was largely historical and
which dealt with some reminiscences of
early farming in California. His refer
ences to the hardships encountered in
early days and to the difficulty of trans
portation were somewhat of a surprise to
the younger generation of farmers pres
ent. Mr. Alviso is at present owner of a
large ranch which be has cultivated for
forty years, and his treatment of the sub
ject of the development of farming in this
country was very valuable and no doubt
suggestive of much that will be put in
practice by others.
Professor J. W. Connell of the Liver
more High School spoke on his favorite
subject of the relation of agriculture to the
high school. The professor nas taught
for years that the training for a practical
farmer should commence in the high
school, and that lads whose future makes
it practically certain that they will be
come agriculturists should lay the founda
tion of a practical knowledge of farming
as early in life as possible. He enlarged
upon this subject, and in earnest language
convinced his audience of the truth of his
remarks.
Professor M. E. Jaffa gave an interest
ing account of the result gained by ex
periments at the State Agricultural Sta
tion with cattle-feeding. H:s paper wa^
eminently practical and it is very evident
that the professor had thoroughly mas
tered his subject.
To-morrow Professor Jaffa will open the
institute with a talk upon California
creamery butter. E. C. Hahn will illus
trate with a large number of specimens
the results of experimental tobacco cul
ture. H. P. Mohr will read a paper on
horse-breeding. J. A. Filcher will discuss
foreign markets. Mrs. W. W. Cunningham
will speak on her favorite subject of home
markets and State Highway Commis
sioner Marsden Manson will close with a
talk on good roads.
No Need to Have Resigned.
OAKLAND, Cax., Jan. 18.â D. Edward
Collins nas been placed in the position of
resi nine: from an office to which he was
never appointed. A few days ago the di
rectors of the Board of Trade, Merchants'
Exchange and Good Roads Association
met and decided upon three names to sub
mit to the Governor to appoint as park
commissioners for this city. A wrong re
port was given out, and as soon as Mr.
Collins saw his name in the newspapers
he declined to act on account of his large
business interests, which require ail his
attention. It now transpires that Mr.
Collins was not one of the three, and that
the names were N. W. Spaulding, Robert
M. Fitzgerald and John A. Britton.

WILL ADMIT LIQUOR ADS.
They Will Have Free Access to
the Pages oi Blue and
Gold.
Stormy Meeting ot the Junior Class
at Berkeleyâ Co-:ds Out in
Full Force.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 18.â Liquor
"ads" will have carte blanche to the
pages of '98s Blue and Gold. Such was
the decision of the junior class at the
State University this afternoon after a
lengthy war of wordi, in which a dozen or
more of tiie "eds" and one "co-ed"
participated.
The set of resolutions introduced to de
bar liquor advertisements from the an
nual was overthrown by a vote of 51 to 42.
This action of the class is the result of an
extended controversy over the principle
and propriety of admitting such advertis
ing matter between the combined forces
of the college ST. M. C. A. and the Y. W.
C. A. and the other members of the class.
The co-eds were out in force to-day. Iv
fact it was the largest delegation of young
lady members of the class that has assem
bled since the .freshman year. The side
they took on the question soon became
approved, and they voted almost to a
single person against the insertion of the
disputed ads. AUer the discussion over
the question had Deen brought to a close,
a secret ballot was demanded, and during
the count the excitement ran high be
cause of the almost uniform Bcores which
was run up until- the last when the sup
porters of the ads male a spurt aud fin
ished nine ballots a cad.
W. W. Bristol, author of the condem
natory resolutions passed by the A. M. C.
A., opened up the tight. He reviewed
the case from a standpoint of morality,
principle and finance, and was followed
by H. L. Wast-? and F. R. Faircliili. who
spoke in the sunie tenor. Editor Rector
of tbe B. and O. turned the tide by offer
ing the excuse for the insertion of tlie
liquor ads that tne book needed the money
winch they would yield. 0. H. Allen
came in with a like ODinion. C. C. Boyn
ton did not want the ads to go in because,
he said, the public conception of a college
student now is a young man with a book
in one hand and a wine-glass in the other.
Then came the single co-ed speaker,
Miss L. R. Haenlehn, who acted as stakes
man for her college sisters. She made a
valiant stand for the cause of temperance
and against the "nefarious influences
which lurk In the liquor ads."
The matter then came to a vote with
the result that the Y. M. C. A. and the
Y. W. C. A. were forced into the back
ground.
A shout of approval went up when it
was found that the liquor men had been
given the privileges oi the back pages of
the book.
The principal arguments offered in favor
of admitting the ads was that the publica
tion needed tbe money, and that their
appearance would work no harm to any
one.
More trouble is anticipated before the
question is finally settled.

MINISTERS PROTEST.
Supervisors Table a Petition to Re
peal the Kacetrack
Ordinance.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 18â The mem
bership of thirty-six churches was rep
resented in a petition to-day which was
presented to the Supervisors,- asking for
the suppression of racetrack gamblers In
this county. The communication came
from Rev. Dr. Coyle and Rev. F. F. Bo
vard and in addition to the petition con
tained a letter stating % that the protest is
signed by the pastors and official members
and a sufficient number of prominent
Christian people to inform the Supervisors
beyond any reasonable doubt as to the
Christian sentiment of the people in this
county. The petition reads as follows:
Whereas, The racetrack is a place in which
pool-selling, gambling and all accompanying
victs are carried on almost without restraint,
annulling the lundamental laws of society,
viz: a manly dependence on honest labor,
corrupting the public conscience, endanger
ing the peace aud safety of society, disgracing
tne fair name of our county,' preventing
citizen* with high moral convictions from lo
cating in this part of the State and practically
driving scores of families irom their homes;
and whereas, the ordinance \ assed by your
honorable body August 17, 1896, is general in
terms, permitting racetracks to be opened in
every part of the county, and is therefore a
menace to every community in the county;
therefore we, the undersigned ministers and
official members of the churches of Alameda
County, acting In the capacity of citizens, rep
presenting, as we beiieve, the strongest con
victionsof our congregations and the Chris
tian sentiment of our respective communi
ties, Join in an earneÃt and respectiul protest
against the action of rour honorable body in
passing the above ordinance licensing race
tracks within the county, witb permission to
sell pools and carry or all kinds of gambling
within their enclosures. We furthermore
urgently petition your honorable board to re
consider and repeal said ordinance, substi
tuting therefor an ordinance making it unlaw
ful to sell pools or carry on any kind of gam
bling within the limits of this county.
Supervisor Church made a motion that
the petition and protest should be laid on
the table. His motion carried, with only
Talcott opposing it.
Supervisor Roeth attempted to have the
protest referred to the Judiciary and Ordi
nance Committee, bat his motion received
no second.
ACME NOT TO BLAME.
President Allen Has Secured a Kehear-
Ing for His Club.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 18.â The Pacific
Amateur Athletic Association has de
cided to'grant the Acme Club a rehearing.
The club was suspended about two weeks
ago for sixty days.
'"The situation was not clearly under
stood," said President Allen to-day, "and
I think, at .least, we deserve a rehearing.
The trouDle ;<.rose over the Tye-Muller
contest, which was given by the Cycling
Annex and not by the club. While the
cyclists are all club members and we rec
ognize the annex, we ought not to be held
responsible for anything they may do
which we have not sanctioned. In regard
to the Tye-Muller nff air, the directors
were asked about it, but we did not have
time to consider the matter before it came
off. Mul'er is generally recognized as a
professional, and probably the annex
overstepped tne rules. Bui it was not
sanctioned by the Acme Club, and when
we presented" this view to the association
they agreed to reopen the case.
"It i* a matter of very little importance,
however, as the sixty dnys will have ex
pired before there are any big events in
which the Acme would "care to partici
pate."
TOLD TO HANG HIMSELF.
Peculiar Story Belated by a Child at
the Prison.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 18. âFrank
Fisher, a boy about 12 years of age, was
taken to the City Prison last night, where
he told a most remarkable story. He said
that his mother was dead and his father
was cruel to him.
"My father took me to the ferry in San
Francisco last night," said the boy, "gave
me t n cents to Duy my ticket across the
bay and a small piece of rope with which
he told me to go and hang myself."
Tbe boy when found by an officer was
wandering about in West Oakland, and
had a small piece of rope with him. He
was turned over to Mrs. .PrescoU of the
children's society to-day, and that officer
took him across the bay and gave him into
the custody of Mr. Welch of t: c San Fran
cisco society.
REV. DR. McLEAN RESIGNS
Cannot Do the Work Required
of a Professor and a
Pastor.
He Will Occupy His Old Pulpit Whil
His Successor Makes a Trip
to Europe.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. i
Rev. J. K. McLean, D.D., has resi ned
from the pastorate of the Plymouth Con
gregational Church. Tbe news that ho
had decided to sever hia connection with
the church to which he has ministered
over a year was a great surprise in church
circles, as a few months ago, when the
report was circulated that his resignation
wus possible, it was denied.
Tbe resignation of Dr. McLean has not
yet been acted upon by the trustees, but it
will certainly be accepted, as the doctor
has definitely stated that he cannot, under
any consideration, reconsider his action.
l"n a short time Rev. C. R. Brown, the
successor to Dr. MoLean at the First Con
gregational Church, will go to Europe on
his wedding tour and his pulpit will be oc
cupied by Dr. McLean. Mr. Brown ex
pects to be absent some months.
"I have resigned," said Dr. McLean to
night," "as I find it impossible to attend
to my duties at the Pacific Theological
Seminary, and also do the work of a pajj
tor. I shall occupy the pulpit at my old
church during Mr. Brown's absence, and
on his return shall devote myself entirely
to the work of. the seminary.
Salisbury's Insolvency.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 18.â A petition

ceiver for the creditors of Monroe Salis
bury, the well-known horseman of Pleas

the leading spirit of a ''dummy" cor
poration and that he has done other
things which are not for the benefit of his
creditors.
Judge Hall has made an order citing
Salisbury to be in court on February 1, to
show cause why he should not be declared
an involuntary insolvent. John Stewart
represents the following claims: H.
Arendt & Co., $562;. Bank of Pieasanton,

George F. Weeks Purchases a
Controlling Interest in
the Paper.
Rev. F. S. Brush Inclined to Deal
Liberally With His Amateur
Comedians â Aiameda Notes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Janl 18.â The Rev. F.
S. Brash is not inclined to deal narshly
with the members of the Christian En
deavor Society who refuse to accept a sug
gestion from him and abandon the farce
they are preparing to g:ve in the church
parlors on the 9th of next month. While
it is opposed to his idea of propriety and
the proper way of raising funds for the
convention assessment, he has decided to
allow the present arrangements to be car
ried out rather than to raise a division in
his congregation. Not in years has any
thing caused such universal comment and
aroused such interest in church circles in
this city as the publication Sunday morn
ing of Mr. Brush's views. He is well
known here, and is the pastor of the
largest and most fashionable church, of
the city, wLere he is universally liked and
respected.
Joseph Falkingham, the chairman of
the social committee which has charse of
the coming production of "My Turn
Next," is a young commission merchant
of San Francisco and a leading worker
both in his own society and church and
the Alanieda City Union, of which be is
the treasurer. He declares that the pastor
should not have waited until the eleventh
hour and then tried to have placed them
under a ban.
Mr. Brush will use educational rather
than, prohibitive measures with the young
people, and in the near future he will
E reach upon "Proportionate Giving" as is
eing aviated at present in Oakland. He
is greatly pleased with the worfc being
done by the Oakland City Union, which
will hold a rally Thursday evening for the
discussion of the money-raising subject
and which has asked ail of the Protestant
pastors of the city to preach upon the sub
ject next Sunday.
"I intend to take up this matter and
make it a subject for a sermon soon," said
Mr. Brush to-day. "The arrangements
already made Diay be carried out,- but I
hope it will be the last thing of the kind
undertaKen. I am not a believer in rais
ing money that way, and I will prepare a
sermon soon that will place the matter in
the right light."
On Friday the junior superintendent
has arranged for a "missionary dialogue"
in the church parlors, for wbicii an a mis
sion will be charged, and next week a
iunny sketch entitled "The Old Red
Scl.oolhouse" will be given in Linde
man's Opera-house. The latter is under
the direction of the Young Men's' Club,
composed of young men who have out
grown the Boys' Brigade. J. E. Baker,
ca?hier of the Aiameda Bank, is the presi
dent of the club.
Change in the Enclnal.
ALAMEDA, -Cal., Jan. 18.â George F.
Weeks, editor and proprietor of the
B:\kerstield Californian, has purchased a
controlling interest in the Encinal of thia
city, and will place it in a new dress on
thelirstof the month. He has also pur
chased a new press and all necessary sup
plies to make i-t one of the finest appear
ing papers on the coast. He will bring a
considerable portion of his job outfit with
him from Bakers-field. Mr. Weeks was in
town to-day looking over the field and
making all of the necessary arrangements
for his business.
The deal is - consummated, but the
papers have not been signed, owing to the
proprietorship of the routes, which are
owned by a private individual. Mr.
Krauth has agreed to give a clear title to
them, so the deal is now assured.
"I virtually assume control to-day,"
said Mr. Weeks to a representative of The
Call, "but owing to business in
Bakersfield I will not take up *he editorial

the paper will appear in an entirely new
dress and be printed on a new press. I
have the press purchased now and it is in
San Francisco. I am considering the
ground floor of the water company's build
ing for an office. It is centrally and pleas
antly located for a newspaper office. I
snail bring a considerable quantity of
type from the Ca:ifornian office when I
ccme back. I am going back to Bikers
field to-morrow evening to prepare for my
removal to this city."

covered with a heavy growth of beard
while his eyes are large and expressive
behind a pair of spectacles.

FIRST CHOICES
DO NOT THRIVE
Four Out of Six Favorites
Bowled Over at Emery
ville.
Salvabe Got the Decision Ovsr
Cabrillo in a Close
Finish.
Lost Girl AÂ»ain in Front at Odds of
25 to Iâ R^y del Bandidos in
Race Form.
The downfall of foar favoritesâ not an
unusual occurrence at the Emeryville
track across the bay â a good-sized attend
ance and one very close finish tell the
etory of a day's racing. One who discards
the "dope " book at OaKJand will do well.
The form-player will eventually land at
the revulsive-looking iron doors of the City
Prison, applying for a night's lodging.
Such is the vast difference in affairs exist
ing between two tracks situated not
twenty miles apart.
The judges in the stand stated that
Ealvable won by half a length. Other
keen observers made it a short head, while
just a few spectators thought Cabrillo was
first over the wire. The race in particu
lar, a mile dash, solved down to ttiree
starters â Saivable, who receded in the
betting from 7 to 10 to evens, Cabrillo and
Schiller. Cabrillo, with Isom up, made
all the running and was beaten out in
l:Al%. Show honors, of course, went to
Schiller.
Olive was a 6 to 5 favorite for the open
ing seven-fur.ong selling event. The mare
met with a little hard luck at the outset
and in a hard drive was beaten out a
head by Ban Marco, tbe second choice,
ridden "by Sam Doggett. Jack Richelieu
at 50 to 1 was a goefd tlnrd.
Johnny McHale's eood colt Basqnil was
a Tedhottip for tiie five and a half furlong
maiden dash that followed, going to the
post Bto 5. Ridaen by Charley Thorpe he
waÂ« badly messed about and beaten two
lengths by Jack o' Lantern, against whom
7 to 2 was laid.
Lost Girl again secured winning brackets
in the third event at six and a half fur
longs. Twenty-five to one was obtainable
against her, but whether she waa the best
or the lot starting in the race is a matter
ot conjecture. Rienzi, against, which 10 to
1 was laid, ran an excellent race under
Slaughter's rather poor piloting, and was
beaten out but three parts of a length.
Tempestuous was third. George Palmer,
the 8 to 5 choice, running in next to last
position down the hack stretch, made a fine
run, but was unable to get witnin the
money.
Pat Dunne's Formal ruled a 3 to 5 fa
vorite for the mile and a quarter ruu, and
looking all over a winner at one Â»:age of
the journey was eventually beaten out by
both Rev del Bandidos and Unity. The
winner, Rey del Bandidos, who went back
in the betting from threes to 6 to 1, came
from last position at the head of the
Ftretch and downed the pacemaker,
Unity, nearly a length in 2:uÃJ^.
With La Mascota possessing no speed
whatever, the final five and a half f uriong
spin was n^tnintr but a galiop for the 6 to
J5 favorite, Benamela. Hazel D, a 200 to 1
shot, look the place from Petrarch in a
drive.
NOTES.
Amos "White is again training the bones
owned by W. 08. Macdonougb.
Monita was well backed to win tbe firpt
race, but bis tyro hard runs of last week were
riot without their effect. Tbe gelding was
unplaced at the finish.
Ciaudiana, tbe filly, by imp. Brutus
from Swayback, starting in the second
event, made a very creditable showing,
and will bear watching in her future races.
Imp. Mistral 11 was quite extensively
played on some recent good workouts,

but failed utterly to run up to them in tne
race.
Great things were expected by the pub
lic of La Mascota, second choice in me
betting on the last even', and what a dis
appointment she proved. One spectator
said, "he heard after he got his bet down
that she wa* not good." Now that is in
deed soothing consolation, and if such
was tbe case wny was the mare started.
With 99 pounds up she shou'd have been
fightine for the money, yet she was mis
erably beaten off. When a poor stable
lad on a 500 to 1 shot goes out in front of
his field tbe "crab" under him dies away,
he is set down for incompetent and sus
picious riding When a jockey of note fin
ishes a most shoiny exhibition it is a mis
take of judgment. One jockey can run
another out wide and almost force turn
iqto the judges' stand and it is not foul
I riding. Another horse may swerve a tri
fle with his jockey and the rider is set
down for questionable riding* The racing
game has some pecu iar phases and the
regular patron has indeed become a phil
osopher.

PLANTING SALMON FEY.
Thousands of Young Fishes "Will Be
Liberated in Streams Contiguous
to the Ocean.
As an experiment the California Fish
Commissioners suggested some time ago
to J. J. "irice, United States Fish Com
missioner at Washington, that the raising
and planting of salmon try at some place
contiguous to the ocean would be replete
witn good results.
The State Fish Commissioners are of the
opinion that a large percentage of the
salmon fry planted in the head waters of
the Sacramento Kiver near the site of
Battle Creek hatchery never reach the
ocean, as predatory fish destroy larÂ«e
numbers of try while on their long jour
ney to the sea.
To obviate this, â¢ 750,000 eggs of the
Qumnat salmon were shipped from Battle
reek on January 1 to a small hatchery
which was built a few years ago in the
vicinity of Olema. Marin County.
United Slates Fish Commissioner Brice
acquiesced in the opinion of the local Fish
Commissioners and at the Government's
expense the experiment is now being
tried.
The little fishes will be liberated in Ole
ma, Lagunitas and Paper-mill creeks as
soon as they commence to feed, which will
be in March or April next.
F. A. Shebley, foreman of Taboe City
hatchery, is looking after the Olema
hatchery and under his watchful eye it is
expected that very few of the iry will per
ish. Experts contend that the youug sal
mon will not return to the waters in which
they will be planted, but that after they
are in the ocean for some time they will
seek the Sacramento Kiver or some other
large body of fresh water. The experi
ment will be watched with much interest
by the Commissioners.

The idea that alcohol keep's out the cold
is wropg, as mountaineers have found by
repeated experience that the opposite of
this holds true.

WHETTING THE WEAPONS IN
THE BUTTLE OF MILLIONS
Notary Cooney and the Fair People to Begin to Fight
It Out in the Criminal Courts
To-day.
BOTH PARTIES APPEAR
CONFIDENT.
The Grand Jury Not Going to
Interfere in the Con
troversy.
STEPHEN RCBSRTS PUTS OK
WARPAINT.
Ha Scathes the H"irs and Reviews
Their Course in the Famous
Suit.
Both sides in the Fair delegation were
bu-sy yesterday sharpening their weapons.
The Fair people claim that they are pre
pared to impale ex-Notary J. J. Cooney
this morning, when the case on the per
jury charge made by young Fair's lawyers
is to come up.
The Craven people say there is no
danger of serious damage resulting to
the young notary, and thus both sides are
standing grimacing and winking wicKedly
at each other in this came of millions.
The Fair people are still strenuously en
deavoring to get the Grand Jury into the
right. They stated yesterday morning
that that body would present a batch of
indictments shortly. Then District At
torney Barnes said just to the contrary.
Stephen Roberts took a hand in the con
troversy, and offered to bet a new hat
against a penny that the whole affair was
a bugaboo built up by the Fair attorneys.
And so the breezes blew.
The Fair people want Cooney's scalp
very badly, if all the efforts they are about
go for anything. They say they have a
printer who will swear that the paper in
the certificates on Craven pencil deeds was
not in existence in 1894.
They declare that they have the plates
and electrotypes, which will be intro
troduced as evidence to establish that the
engraving was not done until 1896. two
3'ears after the date of the Cooney indorse
ments. Then there is the water-mark of
the paper and a whole batch of similar
items that will follow in line.
Captain Lees is, of course, going to take
a hand in the affair, and so is the District
Attorney, and so are half a dozen of the
big lawyers in the City. The Craven in
terests will be defended by many able
lawyers, as Cooney is one of the principal
supports to the deeds.
Stephen Roberts donned his war paint
when he heard that the Fair attorneys
were endeavoring to have the Grand Jury
interested on the side of the e-tate.
He hunted up the District Attor
ney to learn it was decided that
the whole matter will be passed by, and
then he unburdened himself about the
tactics of bis opponents in a way that was
intended to make ti.eir ears tingle.
"This constant reiteration of forg
ery, fraud and perjury by the
Fair people," he began, "is simply to
prejudice the public mind. The pres
ent proceedings against Coon^y are
taken, not with any hope of success, but
simply to blacken him in the eyes of the
people. It's an old trick, and wa.-< tried in
the Sharon estate when one of the expert
witnesses was arrested on the eve of the
trial of the civil case.
"It's singular that all this inud-slinginc;
comes from the Fair children. For two
years they have been talking of what they
are going to prove and thus far have
proved simply nothing. We have kept
quiet under" all sorts of attacks. Nearly
two years ago the heirs and all their at
torneys vouched for the integrity of Mrs.
Craven and for the genuineness of
the will left in her keeping. Dur
ing her absence in the East for
the purpose of bringing that will
out here tne three children of their own
accord authorized Richard V. Dcv to pay
Mrs. Craven not exceeding $500,000 for her
claims against the estate. At that time
they knew of the existence of the deeds
and had reason to know of the contract
marriage.
"After that will waÂ« brought out here
they said in court that it was genuine,
but the moment Mrs. Craven asked them
to live up to their contract they gently in
sinuated fraud. They did, howevor, agree
to pay her $300,000 at that time. The offer
was refused and the deeds put on record.
It has been said there was something sus
picious about the way that was done.
Weil, I Knew that the trust will had
been stolen and I didn't care to see
our deeds disappear from the Recorder's
office in a similar way. We knew that
the three children were* seeking to derive
the benefit of the will without paying
the cost of Mrs. Craven's action. I
knew that they were in pencil
and that no excuse would answer at
a trial for their non-appearance. For
these reasons Mr. Williams and mysell
refused to leave them with the Recorder,
but various abstractors and myself had
examined them and knew that they
existed.
"Immediately after this the attorneys for
the children began to cry forgery and con
spiracy. A number of depositions
were taken, and the testimony of
Mrs. Craven, M;ss Craven, Mrs. Cos
ack, Mrs. Has Kins, Mrs. Johnson,
Judge Sullivan, J. J. Cooney, Lee
D. Craig and myself, which to strongly
showed the genuineness of these deeds
and the truth of all the other portions of
Mrs. Ciaven's story. It was said that aW
tne witnesses were perjured with the ex
ception of Judge Sullivan.
"Months a.EO Charles L. Fair swore in

an answer brought by Mrs. Craven to
eject the heirs from her property. In that
answer, to show with what ease
such affidavits can be made, Charles
Fair swore that his father died on a
day other than the real day of his death.
About this time what is known as the San
Rafael story was brought to light, and the
prominent connection with it of Captain
Lees, the co-laborer of Detective Seymour.
"Then the children had positive proof,
so they said, that they would prove that
their father was not in the City on the
day the pencil will was made It was
an item of Senator Fair's health. They
knew all these things by the millionaire's
valei, and yet it was on the programme
tiiat this same valet was, -a ye;ir previous,
of the opinion that his master was sick at
the Lick Hou?e on this same day.
"And so it goes. Resort was atrain had
to the old general charges of fraud. People
wanted to know what Captain Lees was
doing in matters of a private litigation.
Well, alone comes the present criminal
charge against Cooney to discredit him.
Now Cooney said six months ago just
what he said the other day and for
saying which he is now charged
with per jury. â¢ If he committed per
jury in December he committed it
in July last? Where were the police then?
If they were moving in this matter be
cause crime had been committed they
were criminally slow. Six months ago
all the testimony was in and it was public
enough to give any one who had the least
fear a chance to escape.
"The truth of it is that they have
adopted these means to frighten Cooney
into making a false confession. One of
the attorneys for tne Fair children has re
marked that 'Cooney was a weak sister,'
and t;.fv thought to make him show the
white feather.
"Let us look at the positions of the two
camps. On the one side is Mrs. Craven,
who is vouched for as a respectable, hard
working schoolteacher, living on
I her salary, the Intimate Iriend of
| Senator Fair, and so vouched in
j court by the attorneys of two
lof his children. She stands alone and is
i admittedly poor and is represented by
i Delmas & Shortndge, Denson & De
j Haven and W. W, Foote. These are
honorable men and would not advocate
her causa if they did not believe
in the geuineness of those deeds.
I One ot them is an ex-Judee of a
I Superior Court whose record is above re
proach. One of them is an ex-Judge of
the Supreme Court and has been men
i tioued as a possible member of the next
! Cabinet. Another is an ex-regent of tue
State University.
"In the other camp stand the three
children with their concentrated millions
at their back. These same chil
dren in matters of wills have stood
on every side and on most sides
at least twice. What they have
stated in court one day they have denied
the next, now crying forgery and fraud
against a man of whem one of their own
attorneys said, 'Cooney never did a dis
honest thing in his life. He has attended
j to my business, and I know him well.'
One of them has so carelessly sworn to an
affidavit that its falsity is absurd.
"The truth of the matter is the Fair
1 children are using the influence at their
back to blacken the character of witnesses
against them in the minds of the people
and a jury. Some people are prone to
look no deeper than the surface, you
I know."
PERMANENT OFFICERS.
Hayei Valley Improvement Clnb Now

CASES DISMISSED.
Judge Belcher Knock* Out Over 150
Negligent Litigants.
Judge Belcher yesterday made a clean
sweep of the dead cases that have been
incumbering his calendar*. There were
325 actions listed in his department, but
for one reason or another the litigants or
their attorneys have lost interest in a
great many ot them, and consequently
152 of them were ordered not only stricKen
off, but actually dismissed.
It is expected by Clerk Morris that
quite a number of the litigants will arouse
themselves as soon as tLey find that they
are out of court, and that they will be
rushing around like chickens with their
heads cut off trying to get back. To ac
commodate nil such Judge Belcher issued
the following order:
All causes on general calendar called this
day, numbered below 50,349, and marked
"dismissed" by the court suh sponte, may be
restored on proper showing; and as to all
causes numbered 50,349 and subsequent
there Â»o, to be restored on payment of calendar
fee within five months from date.
Judge Belcher intimated that the court
could not be expected to manifest more
interest in the litigation than the attor
neys ana the participants in the suits, and
that the time of the court was too valu
able to be frittered away in calling up
cases when no effort was made to secure a
hearing or settlement in any manner.
For the Emergency Home.
On Thursday evening a fine entertainment
will be given in the Native Sobs' Hall for the
benefit of the Emergency Home for waifs.
The affair is under the direction of Mrs. Wil
liam Fisher of 314 Hayes street. A fine array
of talent will be presented. Orchestras, glee
clubs, athletic organizations have contributed
lioerally, while many persons clever in
specialties of all kinds will appear on the
programme.
lii China a man cannot by will dispose
of his land in favor of any one person,
whether relative or stranger. It must be
distributed among all his male children
without exception.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1897.
CAPTAIN McFEFS SUCCESSOR.
Major W. W. Winchell of the Salvation Army arrived yesterday from New
York, accompanied by Mrs. Winchell and their baby. The raajor comes to take
charge of the social department of the local army work, vice Captain and Mrs.
McFee, called to promotion in Washington, D. C.
Major Winchell has been twelve years with the army in various capacities.
He first served as field captain for three years in Michigan, his native State, where
at Shalott College, one of the leading institutions, he graduated. He went to
Boston and served on the New England division for several months, and was then
appointed representative at the twenty-tifth anniversary celebration of the army's
existence, held at the Crystal Palace, London. While in that metropolis he
received twenty-one different appointments, calculated to give him an insight
into all lines of work, including the country and social departments. He was in
London at the time of Mrs. General Booth's death, and General Booth gave him
one of the first copies of "In Darkest England."
On his return to America he was placed in charge of the Men's Training
Garrison in Brooklyn, and was shortly afterward, in 1891, marriea to his present
wife by Mrs. Ballington Booth, his being the first wedding ever performed by a
woman in this country.
Subsequently Major Winchell went to Milwaukee and Chicago. In Milwaukee
be practically opened the regular work and afterward had charge of the entire
work of the State.
In Chicago some of hi 3 most important work was done. For four yeers he
served as aid-de-camp to Chief Divisional Officer Fielding, and for three years was
in charge of the training garrisons. It was he who engineered the famous distri
bution of food during the Pullman strike in 1894. Lieutenant-Colonel Blackhurst,
now of the Volunteers of tbi3 City, was then his lieutenant. Fifteen hundred
people in Pullman were literally starving, and after Governor Altgeld had in
spected the town Major Winchell put thirty subordinates at work, who made a
thorough canvass and in thirty hours raised hundreds of dollars' worth of pro
visions, which Kept death at bay until the regular relief work could be organized.
Major Winchell left Chicago three months ago, and has since had charge of
the headquarters of the Men's Training Garrison in New York City. Last Christ
nias he distributed 1000 pairs of shoes alone among the poor.
Ho is at present looking over the local field, for which he has many plans.
He brings to his work experience, faith and enthusiasm.
Captain and Mrs. McFee leave for the East Wednesday night. A farewell
reception will be tendered them to-night at army headquarters.
IS POLITICS IT
THE BOTTOM Of IT?
A Step Being Taken Toward
Ousting the Park
Commission.
Irving M. Scott Thinks This May
Explain the Attacks Upon
That Body.
Tie Commission Has Been Investigate
ing for Weeks the Charges Made
by the Last Grand Jury.
A bill is to be introduced in the Legis
lature providing for the increase of the
number of the Park Commissioners from
three to five or seven. The bill provides
that the Governor shall appoint the mem
bers to the commission. The term is for
four years. It may or may not contem
plate thn removal of the present board at
once and the appointment ot an entirely
new body.
Coming as it does at a time when the
commission is under fire, the Grand Jury
investigating and making grave charges
of mismanagement and even dishonesty
against the members, this announcement
is provocative of some speculation.
Irving M. Scott, Park Commissioner,
was told last evening of the proposed in
troduction of this bill before the Legisla
ture.
"If that be true," said Mr. Scott, "it pro
bably is an explanation of the sudden
and, one might, say vicious, attacks on the
commission. If there is suspicion of any
wrongdoing in the matter of hand
ling public money it should cer
tainly be looked into, but it seems
to me that the extreme zealousness of
some newspapers in searching for cause of
complaint, and the vivid fashion of pre
senting what they claim to nave found,
indicate to me something more than the
mere exercise of the province of a news
paper to secure and print the news.
There has seemed to me to be a some
thing back of it, and this story of the bill
to be presented to the Legislature proba
bly explains it. It is politics. So far as
this bill is concerned I have no objection
to any part of it except that providing
that the Governor shall appoint
the members. I do not believe that
the Governor should have any
thing to do with it. I stood for
that â local self-governmentâ in the fram
ing of the charter. We have a young and
active and capable Mayor. He should be
allowed to appoint the commission, I be
lieve in young men in office, and I would
very gladly step aside to make room for a
young man in my place once these charges
are cleared up. But I want to see that
done first. These offices seem to be much
sought after. To me the office is nothing,
aside from the great interest which I
feel of course in the park. I believe all
the other rrembers of the commission feel
the same way about it. The criticisms
seem to be directed most severely at Mr.
Austin. 1 may say that I feel certain that
he is perfectly straightforward in the
whole matter.
"Now, I have only this to say about
the alleged scandal," continued Mr. Scott.
"Charges of irregularities have been made
and the members of the commission are
determined to get at the truth â to rind out
the bottom facts. Ido not propose .to
make any answer to the charges what
ever, except to say that if there is any
dishonesty there I do not know
it. The last Grand Jury in its
report made some mild criticism
of the maim euient of the park, i imme
diately called a meeting of the commis
sion and at that meeting it was deter
mined to begin an investigation of the
causes of complaint. That investigation
was begun and is still going on. The
Grand Jury is also investigating. I shall
insist that that investigation be very
tnorough. Between the two of us we
must certainly get at the truth. That is
what we want. That ia all I have to say."
STABBED IN THE ABDOMEN.
Jamra Creamer Dangerously Wounded
by T. W. Harris, a Conductor.
T. W. Harris, a conductor on the Valen
cia-street cars, was arrested yesterday
morning at his home on Guerrero street
by Policeman Brown and taken to the
Seventeenth-street Station, where he was
charged with an assault to murder.
Sunday night about 8 o'clock Harris,
after reporting off duty, went into a saloon
on Twenty- fifth and Valencia streets.
James Creamer, a young man living at
1921 Valencia street, dropped in and he
and Harris shook dice for drinks.
Creamer made some disparaging remars
nbout Harris and the latter resented it.
They struck at each other and Creamer
landed on Harris' right eye. Harris re
taliated by plunging a knife into Crea
mer's abdomen.
The wounded man was taken to Dr. Mc-
Laughlin, at Twenty-sixth and Mission
streets, who stitched and dressed the
wounds. Tne knife had penetrated the
bowels and the doctor considered the
wound dangerous, as blood-poisoning
might sot in.
Harris denied using the knif\ but the
police say they have witnesses to prove
the contrary.
STRIKING INNOVATION.
Proposition to Have SÂ«-mi- Annual Pro-
motions In the Public School*.
The subject of semi-annual promotions
in the public achoois is under agitation.
The principals of the School Department
hay* just talked it over in meeting. Super
intendent Babcocu considers the matter
one of great interest to parents and chil
dren. "It is not intendod," Superintend
ent Babcock says, "to compel the comple
tion of a year's work in six months, nor
does it mean merely the promotion of
hold-overs. If a class is ready for promo
tion on March 1, it should be permitted to
go on with the next grade work, instead
of being kept in review worK for the next
three months.
"In other words, let the pupil 9 who ac
complish work in less time than one year
pass on; others go slowly." These views
have been presented to the principals, and
at the last meeting a discussion on this
point was i ad by Principals Jones, Me-
Kenzie, Smith and Fairchiid. It was de
cided to leave it to the Superintendent to
decide upon, and send notice to principals
of a uniform method for designating the
advanced and lower divisions of a class,
such as A and B.
A Curious Custom.
A curious custom prevails in certain
parta of India, which may be called a
symbolic marriage. In families where
there are several daughters the youuger
sister may marry only alter the elder sis
ter is married. That, of course, is not al
ways the case, but the obstacle can easily
be surmounted if the elder sister declares
herself ready to marry some tree or
flower or some other lifeless object. In
this way the disagreeable consequences of
disregarding the popular custom may be
avoided and the younger sister can safely
be wedded to her living choice. The elder
sister, however, must take care not to wed
a poplar tree, an elm tree or a pine; if she
chooses a plum, apple or apricot tree she
may get a divorce â that is, shake it off as
soon as a real man will ask for her hand â
while if she marries one of the first three
named trees she cannot easily shake her
marital bonds, for these trees are sacred
and must not be trifled with.â Cincinnati

WHAT LED ROE TO
THE SCAFFOLD
His Brain Revealed but
Slight Evidences of
Insanity.
The Demon of Destruction Is
Veiled in Psychic
Mystery.
Surgeons Will Keep and Examine at
Leisure the Murderer's Organ
of Thought.
The brain of Roe, thn murderer, the bit
of flesh that batched his plans and held
his secrets and alone knew the emotions
that made him a peer among criminals,
was taken from his skull last night. It
weighed but 44 ounces, and as the staff of
doctors of the College of Physicians ana
Snrgeons gazed at the insignificant mass,
they found it no different from that which
might have guided the statesman,
prompted the philanthropist or carried
the conscience and affections of the purest
of the pure.
Although some slight abnormalities ex
isted they were not of sufficient impor
tance to place the dead murderer among
the physically insane criminals who have
expiated their crimes on the gallows. In
fact it is the opinion of the college faculty
that Roe was a psychical pervert and
morally irresponsible for any acts he com
mitted.
One hundred and twenty students and
the entire faculty of the College of Physi
cians and Surgeons witnessed the autopsy.
It -vas a grewsome spectacle.
Dr. E. Z. Hennessey of Napa, who at
tended the prisoner during his incarcera
tion preceding the execution, addressed
the students, placing before them a his
tory of the man.
He said in part that Roe had confessed,
he believed truthfully, to having commit
ted nineteen murders unaided and to
having been a party in the commission of
seven other similar crimes.
Dr. J. R. Lame, president of the faculty
of the College of Physicians and Surgeons
and professor of surgery, assisted by Dr.
E. E. Kelley, professor of anatomy, and
Dr. Howard, demonstrator of anatomy,
then proceeded witn the autopsy.
The brain was removed by taking off
the top of the skull, and then the doctors
began their explorations with the scal
pel.
There was no engorgement and no su
perficial Hemorrhage. It weighed forty
four ounces, which is five ounces under
the average. This, however, has no
special signification, as brilliant men fre
quently carry an organ of thought weigh
ing less than Roe's, and a gibbering idiot
it was once found carried a brain weigh
ing sixty-four ounces.
The right temporal bone was found to
be very thin. A ridge or depression was
found on the left side of the skull, and the
right temporal Done deviated to some ex
tent, the latter abnormality probably pro
ducing a slight compression of the brain.
The convolutions were normal, and bar
ring a slight adhesion alone: the median
line the brain itself seemed to be uninjured
by disease.
The right hemisphere of the brain was
sliced in three pieces and the other was
put in a preserving fluid and will be exam
ined thoroughly for evidence of degenera
tion. It i 3 the intention of the doctors to
examine with equal care the otner organs
of Roes body.
The faculty of the Colleee of Physicians
and Surgeons, in which the autopsy was
held, is as follows:
Dr. S. M. Mouser (president, board of trus
tees), Dr. J. R. Lame (president, faculty;, Dr.
Winslow Anderson (dean of the college), Dr.
S. O. S. Potter, Dr. W. F. Southard, Dr. A. E.

VICTORY FOR CALIFORNIA
The Hawaiian Guards Lose in
the Great International
Match.
They Were Eighty-Five Points Be
hind in the Grand
Total.
The First Regiment team of 100 men
which shot a match with the Hawaiian
National Guard team has won the inter
republic match. The California team
made 3952 points out of a possible 5000.
while the total of the Hawaiians was 3867,
or 85 points behind.
The news of the victory was brought by
the steamer Rio de Janeiro that arrived
yesterday from China, via Honolulu.
When the California team shot tor the
$100 trophy the weather was most unfavor
able. It was expecied that the island
marksmen would have an easy victory,
and without great effort beat a 39.52 aver
age. The Hawaiian team was equally un
fortunate as to weather, for on the day the
match was shotâ January 10â the wind
blew a gale in Honolulu. As a conse
quence, the shooting was far below the
average, the men scoring less than 39
points average. Marksmen who usually
went close to 45 were fortunate in get
ting 40.
The California team was represented Dy
Lieutenant Philip V. Lansdale and Pay
master W. J. Little, of the United States
warship Alert, who were specially dele
gated by Commander Hanford for the pur
pose.

ERRATIC GEOGRAPHY.
Mountains and Lakes Found on the
Map, but Nowhere Else.
Among the anomalous results that geo
graphical exploration is constantly call
ing to the front is the annihilation of
"landmarks" which have oeen considered
to De firmly established. Less than three
years ago it was discovered that Mount
Iseran, a peak of the Graian Alps, which
figured on all detailed maps of the Alpine
regions with the very respectable eleva
tion of upward of 13,000 feet, had no ex
istence in fact, and the assumed mountain
has since been consigned to oblivion. A
somewhat less complete effacement was
announced in the early part of the past
year in the removal of 7000 feet from
the height of Mount Brown, in
British Americaâ generally credited with
an altitude of 16,000 feet in place
of the 9000 feet, which is now given to it
by Professor Coleman â a condition some
what similar to the experience of Mount
Hood, in Oregon, which, when being
gradually reduced irom its presumed
height of 16,000 to 11,000 feet, brought out
tlie facetious remark that with a few
years more of grace the mountain would
be a hole in the ground. It is not alone
the miner explorer, however, who is re
sponsible for the perpetuation of great
errors of observation. Sir Samuel Baker,
the discoverer of the Albert Nyanza, the
second great basin of the Nile, stated that
from his position on the laKe no boun
daries of it could be traced southward to
the limits of vision; whereas Stanley and
others have since shown that not only did
the lake terminate within a few miles of
wnere Baker stood, but that its southern
shore was actually bounded by high
mountains.
G. Scott Elliot, in his recently published
work, "A Naturalist in Mid-Africa," in
turn corrects Stanley's errors with the no
insignificant statement that "Mount Gor
don Bennett, Mackinaw Peak and Mount
Lamspn are not mountains, but quite in
signinant hills, if tuey had any existence
at all." He also said: "I spent much
time and trouble in trying to discover
where on earth the enormous fresh-water
sea, discovered and christened the Alex
ander Nyanza by Mr. Stanley, could possi
bly be. , This, of course, it is now clear,
has no existence whateyer." And finally,
as the latest negative contribution to geo
graphical knowledge, we have in the
Jackson-Harmsworth report from Franz-
Josef Land (recently brought to London
by the vessel of the expedition, the Wind
ward), the assurance that not a trace of
the so-called Peterman Land of Lieu
tenant Bayer could be discovered, and
that even Lichy Land was merely a dis
jointed arch i pelagic mass of entirely in
considerable extent.
Mistaken Identity.
Senator Hoar tells this story, says the
Washington Post: He was riding on a
train down on Cape Cod this summer,
when he felt a tap on his shoulder, and,
glancing back, he saw a benevolent-look
ing old lady studying his face. "Excuse
me," she said, "but aren't you Mr. Jeffer
son ?" The Senaior thought at first lie
had been taken for Thomas Jefferson, and
he was inclined to be piqued. Then it oc
curred to him that Joe Jefferson, the
actor, inhabits that part of the country, so
he replied benignly: "No, I am not Mr.
Jefferson. Will you be kind enough to
tell me which of his characters I remind
you of? Was it Bob Acres or Itip Van
Winkle?" "A little of both," was the
reply.

, DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: For a long time I have been treated by various doctors for
kidney disease, with great pain in the back as well as other parts of the body. I have been a
great sufferer for about five years, being terribly nervous and afflicted- with severe rheuma-
tism also. The doctors had tried to cure me without producing any beneficial results, and I
was not able to find relief until I tried your Electric Belt. After wearing it only one week my
pain was all removed, and I have found out since my nervousness and pains are permanently
cured, as I have had no return of the trouble. This, astonished me as well as my friends, but
it is truly so. as lam willing and glad to testify. Every one knows me in Sacramento. I have
already recommended your Belt to my friends, and shall continue to do so, as it is a sure care
and does its work well and quickly. Your grateful patient,

BURGLARY AND
ATTEMPTED ARSONS
A. House on Eleventh Ave
nue Broken Into and
Looted.
The Burglar Sets Fire to One
of the Bedrooms to Cover
Up His Crime.
The Smoke Is Observed and Firemen
Extinguish the Flames Before
Much Damage Is Done.
A burglary and a deliberate attempt to
destroy the building to cover up the crime
were perpetrated in the house at 423 Elev
en th avenue yesterday afternoon.
The building is occupied by Thomas F.
Denny and William J. Denny and their
sister, who is a teacher in one of the pub
lic schools. All arq absent during the
day attending to tbeir business, Thomas
being a joiner and WUlian: a carpenter.
Shortly after 3 o'clock a smooth-faced
young man was seen to hurriedly leave
the bouse with a large bundle under bis
arm, by a neighbor named Andrews, and
immediately afterward smoke was seen is
suing from the house.
Andrews ran to the fire station on Sec
ond avenue and notified the firemen.
They hurried to the scene and soon extin
guished the fire, which was confined to
one of the bedrooms. The bedclothes had
been deliberately set on tire and the
flames had consumed nearly the entire
bed before the firemen reached the scene.
An examination showed that the burg
lar had effected an entrance by breaking
the glass in a window in the rear and un
fastening the catch.
Every room had been ransacked.
Drawers had been pulled out and their
contents scattered over the floors. Trunks
bad been forced open and money and
jewelry stolen, besides other articles of
value. The place was practically looted,
and the loss will be considerable.
A telephone message was sent to police
headquarters, and detectives were sent
out to the bouse. A careful examination
was made of the premises, and several of
the neighbors were questioned, but none
appeared to have seen him except An
drews, who was, however, able to give a
good description of the burplar, and the
detectives expect to have him in custody
soon, as they think they know him.
Every effort will be made to find bim,
as it is seldom that a burglar resorts to tire
to destroy the evidence of his crime.
