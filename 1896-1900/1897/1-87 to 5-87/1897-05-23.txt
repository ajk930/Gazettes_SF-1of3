GRAND ISLAND, Cal., May 22. â A
monster airship, built on lines essentially
different from any aerial craft ever in
vented, is in an advanced stage of con
si ruciion in a secluded spot in the vicin
ity of Grand Island.
For past two months the people of
the neighborhood have been kept bus."
guessing what the strange structure is of
which they have occasionally caught
hasty glimpses. Rumors of a mysterious
machine with huge wings, adapted equally
for navigation through air or water, have
crept into the local paper-, and over the
whole country for miles around the mys
terious craft Is the sole topic of specula
tion.
The airship is being built by the Sweany-
Davenport Manufacturing Company,
which has been incorporated with a capi
tal stock of $10,000, all subscribed and
paid up, for the express purpose of making
this attempt to solve the long unsolved
problem of practical aerial navigation.
The office.*** of the company are F. L.
Sweany, president; M. G. Fornia, vice
president, and C. B. Pooler, secretary and
treasurer, who. with vV. B. Parrett and C.
I. Davenport, constitute the board of di
r-c'T*". -â " --. â '-''**â 'â â  ! -'-- >.â¢*â¢*'*.,.*
Messrs. Sweany and Davenport have
been busy working on the craft for some
weeks past, and but for the delay of East
ern manufacturers in forwarding several
parts of the. mechanism the ship would
have been completed before this, the in
tention of the inventors having originally
been to make the trial trip about the first
of May. .As it is it will probably be the
middle of July before the craft will be
launched.
When finished the craft will measure
125 feet in length, 47>_ feet from the floor
of the car to the top of the cylinder and
37*_ feet between the tips of the propel
lers. The structure will consist of an
elliptical gas-filled cylinder, to which a
car is attached, and two propellers situ
ated not behind the cylinder- as has been
the case with most airships, on*, on both
sides of the craft at the end of revolvable
shafts. It differs also from other craft in
being without sails or rudder, being steered
entirely by the propellers.
A Call reporter and artist visited the
scene of operations this morning at the
Frank Sl.illi^ ranch, on the Sutter County
shore of the Sacramento River. Messrs.
Davenport and Sweany were busily at
work at the forge and in the carpenter
shop, adjusting the mechinism that is to
be used in the ship. At present the craft
is oniy partially constructed. The car
has been nearly completed and the canvas
cylinder has been made. I: will be coated
inside and outside with rubber paint, and
when all is ready for the trial trip, it will
be inflated with hydrogen gas. The tank
that will be used in generating the gas is
already on the ground, and also 8000
pounds of sulphuric acid and 8000 pounds
of iron shavings that will be used in the
process.
. "Our structure," said one of the in
ventors, "is not a flying-machine, but an
airship. We rely, for lifting it, on a gas
inflated cylinder with a capacity of 46,000
cubic feet. Pure hydrogen gas will be
used, with a total lifting capacity of abont
3300 pounds. _Bf^_s9fi___
"There ate several new features which we
have introduced in the construction of the
cylinder. . Besides being. made non-collap
sable by the use oi bicycle tubing running
lengthwise with the cylinder, there is at
tached to' the cylinder underneath it a
smaller, or compensating, cylinder, into
which the gas escapes as it expands with
the rise of the airship. As the ship de
scends and the gas contracts, it rises from
the compensator into the main cylinder/
Without this compensator, the gas would
have to be allowed to escape into the air,
and would thus be lost, or the cylinder
would burst from the expansion of the
gas. Another improvement is the placing
of the safety-valve below the equator of
the cylinder, thereby making it impossible
for more than half the eas to escape in
case of any accident to the valve.
"The cylinder is rigidly connected with
the car, which is fifteen feet in length by
five in width and weighs 377 pounds. In
the car will be placed the motive power, a
gasoline engine of four horse-power.
"The most important and essential 'ea
ture of our ship is the mechanism by
which we obtain our propelling and steer
ing power. We .depend' on no sails or
rudders for steering.' Wben these devices
are used it is necessary to achieve a con
siderable speed before the sails or rudders
are of any avail. This , has, been the fatal
defect in every attempt ;at aerial naviga
tion. With our mechanism our ship can
be perfectly controlled in r any' position,
whether at rest- or : in- motion. We, can
turn clear around either way within the
length of our "hip and ascend or descend
perpendicularly independently of the di
rection of the .wind." v"
"There are two propellers, situated \ one
on either side midway between tbe cyiin
The San Francisco call
der and the car, supported at the outer
ends of revolvable shafts which extend
nine feet on either side of the car. Each
propeller consists of six aluminum
blades, each blade being about five feet
wide and eight feet lone. These propellers
are fastened upon a revolving shaft placed
at right angles to and at the end of the
supporting revolvable shaft. Thus the
propellers work in a free atmosphere, and
the air whicb they set in motion does not
strike against the cylinder and offer re
sistance to its motion.
"The axis upon which the propellers
revolve always points in the direction in
which the ship is moving. . Consequently
to propel the ships in any direction it is
only necessary to change the direction of
the axis of the propellers., This is ac
complished by rotating the supporting
shaft by means of a mechanism completely
under the control of the operator. Our
machinery is fitted throughout with roller
and ball-bearings, and lin the whole
structure there are no cog-gearings. Fric
tion is tri us reduced to a minimum.
"Our method of navigating our craft is
as simple as, and quite similar to the
method used by an oar-man in turning a
rowboat. When we wish to turn, we
merely direct the axis of one propeller
forward and the other backward. In
making any of the above changes it is
never necessary to slacken the speed of
the revolving propellers."
The promoters of the enterprise express
â¦the utmost confidence in "the success of
their venture. They believe that they
have solved * the vexatious problem of
aerial navigation and that 'â  their dis
covery will revolutionize present methods
of ; travel and! transportation. "When all
our preparations have been completed.''

give people a full opportunity to see our
craft and its workings. We will hover

"we * intend to make a transcontinental

have no difficulty in carrying sufficient
gasoline to supply our engine for a week;

LOST LOVE

Sweetheart.

RAIL-SPLITTER.

Tells of the Courtship
of 1836. . â
WOULD NOT MARRY A MAN SHE
DID NOT LOVE.,
Considers Washington and Jeffer- '
. son Greater Men Than the Im
mortal War President..
CALISTOGA, Cal., May 22.â An in
teresting story of Abraham Lincoln's
first and most ardent courtship has
just come to ligbt in this little moun
tain town of Calistoga, where the mar
tyred President's early love dwells, a
sweet old lady of 84.
Mrs. Susan' Boyce is the name of tha
charming octogenarian, who, as Miss
Susan Reid of New Salem, on the Sanga
mon River,' in Illinois, refused to marry
the immortal war President in 1836. She
dwells in : a humble little cottase with
her widowed sister, wbo is bat a few years
her junior. Her hut-band has been dead
for many years and her principal income
is a pension which she draws by reason of
injuries her husband received in the
lamous Black Hawk war while fighting
side by side with Lincoln, whose friend he
was.
Mrs. Boyce is an unusually bright
woman, whose mental and physical
powers are well preserved, and there is
character in every expression, in all she
says and does, even to tne slightest nod or
gesture." She is about such a. woman as
one familiar with Lincoln's early., life
might suppose .'â  lie co' Ul have loved,- for
she still has a rugged beauty in spite of
the snows .of age, and it requires little
effort to imagine that she was a remark
ably handsome girl in .1836â not a doll
faced creature, but a woman of marked
character. She is tall and stately in ap
pearance, and her eyes are a grayish blue.
Mrs. Boyce' s estimate of the man whoof
fered her/his heart and hand 61 years
ago is a little disappointing to hero-wor
shipers, for she does not consider that he
was so great : as he was honest, and says :
"He is not to be mentioned in the same
class with Washington and Jefferson. I
think Jefferson was the greatest of them
all, because he wrote the Declaration of
Independence."
Sitting on the front porch of her hum
ble boms to-day, Lincoln's first sweet
heart was a beauti.'ul picture of se
rene , old age. Her speech flows gently
and bout a tremor as she recalls events
of her girlhood thoughtfully, yet without
hesitation.
Clad in a plain black dress, with a be
coming .white cap, she folded her arms
and gazed toward the mountains that rise

gently a few hundred feet beyond the front
yard, and said:
"I can truthfully say that I have never
leen sorry that I married - Mr. Boyce
â rather than Abraham Lincoln. You ask
why, perhaps? Well I'll tell you why. 1
have always been a believer in love, in ro
mance, in idealism. I have been a novel
reader and a lover of poetry. I believe,
too, in fate. It was not fated for me to
marry Lincoln. He was an honest young
man, but I d.d nor love him. Why? 1
don't know, but Ido know this, love is a
thing that you can't force. In the first
place he was homely, very awkward and
very superstitious. H. 3 was a spiritualist
and believed in dreams. He often told
me his dreams were prophetic. I did not
like this very well. Ho was only a com
mon rail-splitter .when I knew him, but
he studied bard in his little cabin, and he
was very entertaining. I never saw him
after 1837, and I never heard him make it
speech.
"He used to talk of the stars a great
deal, and he seemed to me a very queer
fellow. I was only a girl when 1 knew
him, for I was born in ISIS in Kentucky,
and I first met Mr. Lincoln in 1836 at the
home of a neighbor named Able. We
were both guests at the house for the day.
There were many young folks there, and I
remember that Lincoln was very bashful.
My father was at that time one of Lin
coln's best friends. His name was Lewie
C. Ileid, and he took Lincoln to Spring
field and introduced him to William E.
Seward, from whom he borrowed the first
Jaw books he ever read. He and my
father were of the same political faith,
nnd they often talked politics by, the
hour.
"But the smooth-faced and awkward
young man wnose memory the nation has
long revered soon began to pay me more
attention than he did my father, and this
pleased my father more than it did me
In those days there w^re no buggies to
speak of, and the way young folks courted
very often was to go out on a horseback
ride together. Mr. Lincoln often took me
out horseback riding, and though he was
not as ardent a wooer as I've seen since he
kept his case goinc pretty lively and
pressed me very hard for an answer. He
â pretended that he never loved a girl before
and would never love anybody as he loved
me, and I think he meant what he said;
but I did not want to marry him, much
as I liked his common-sense, his absence
of "airs' and his great honesty, so I in
vented a story.
"I told him I wa3 engaged to a young
man in Kentucky, but he did not give up
for this, though it cooled his ardor a little
for a time. Finally he lold my father he
would call one day for his final answer,
but I made it a point to be away from
home and he never got over it. My father
lectured me severely for my conduct. He
wanted me to marry Lincoln and he after
wards told me what a little dunce I'd
made of myself, but my mother took my
* art, for site believed love was a thing for
each individual to settle in his or her own
heart. I can say that I have never for one
moment regretted that I did not marry
Mr. Lincoln, for if I could not give a man
my whole heart I'd never marry him for
money or position."
Mrs. Boyce tells of an interesting inci
dent that occurred at a party one night,
where a dozen young folks were trying to
tell their fortunes with the aid of a com
mon doorkey and a Bib c.
"Mr. Lincoln was always interested in j
such things," she said, "and he at once j
wanted to know all about the game, so â 
somebody explained it. It was this:
The key was placed on a verse '
of the open Bible and when ques- I
tions were asked the key was sup
posed to turn by supernatural power. I:

remember Lincoln â¢ asked, 'Will Susie
marry a man whose name begins with L?'
and the key did not move. Then he
asked, 'Will she marry a man whose name
begins with B?' and i the key whirled. I
have often thought that a strange thing.
1 was then going with â . a young j man
named Brooks, and did not then dream of
Mr. Boyce, who became my husband." ,
A strange illustration of the Emerson- ,
ian saying that the gods come in low
guises â Odin in a hut, Jesus in a manger
is seen in Mrs. Boyce's estimate of the
great man whose love she had half a cen
tury ago. Speaking of his mental quali
ties, she said "He was too changeable
and easily influenced by other men, and
he Jacked stability.
"He did not have the education he
ought to have nad to be President, but I
believe lie was as honest as any man who
ever lived. I knew Miss Todd, whom
Lincoln married, and I have heard on
good authority that his marriage was
largely influenced by outside advice. That
is one of the reasons I say what I do
about his lack of stability. Anyhow, as a
young man he struck me as being moved
by his dreams and by outside advice."
Mrs. Boyce says .Lincoln's ardent court
ship forced her to marry sooner than she
would otherwise have done, for when her
father scolded her for not accepting Abra
ham's offer, she married to escape un
pleasant lectures at home. "Mr. Boyce
might have been very rich if he had not
not to gambling," she said, "but we went
to Texas in 1849 and came to California in
1852, and tnere were plenty of temptations
for .amblers. I knew Sam Houston well.
He was not a bit like Lincoln. Houston
loved to dance, while . Lincoln never
danced. That I can remember, but he
often tool- me to siutting-school and
church."
Mrs. Boyce says she has often felt proud
in a way that she knew so good a man as
Lincoln and had his love and esteem, but
she says such a thing as worrying over
what "might have been" has never crossed
her mind for a moment, a* she is a fatalist
pure and simple.
"I believe that whatever way I'm to die
I will die," she said, "and I believe mar
riage and all of the events of life are ruled
largely in the same way. Regrets arc use
less and day dreams are waste of time,
but I do believe in romance and love.
If love is not a fact - then I
have lived and reared my family in
vain. After more than three-score years I
can say that Lincoln was one of the best
friends I ever had and one of the squarest
men I ever knew. If he were alive to
day I'd be getting a bigger pension from
the Government by reason of what
my father and husband did for their coun
try in the Black Hawk war."
The remarkable old woman who en
joys the distinction of having jilted Abra
ham Lincoln has blue eyes and silvery
hair, though it was once raven black. She
is 5 eet 7 inches tail, and is still active on
her feet. The only defection from perfect
health is an eczema that troubles her fac?
and head, for which reason she always
muffles her head and neck.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May > 22.â The
Army and Navy. llegister says: A report
is current at the War Department that
President McKinley will revoke the order
issued by the last administration which
provides for the retirement of Major Dar
ling, . Third Artillery, Presidio of San
Francisco, in June. Prominent friends of
Major Darling are urging this, it is under

the major be detailed as military attache

A few days ago it was said at the War De
partment that Secretary Alger had de
clined to order Major Darling to Vienna.
It is now said that the Secretary is on the
point of reconsidering his action and of
recommending that the order of retire
ment be revoked and that the major be
ordered to Austria.
â¢Secretary Sherman has revoked an or

to army officers contemplating a trip

of State he issued an order providing that
hereafter the State Department will issue
special passports requested by the War
Department to officers going abroad, when
such passports are to be put to uses tend
ing to increase the efficiency of the mili
tary service, and not for the purpose of
purely private or personal convenience.
Practically the order put a stop to officers
going abroad, except in cases where they
were sent officially by the War Depart
ment. It deprived them of opportunities
afforded in Europe of obtaining; military
knowledge beneficial to themselves and
important to the Government. Very nat
urally, many complaints were made by
officers against the order, but Secretary
Oiney refused to rescind it.
On Monday Secretary Alger represented
to Secretary Sherman that it was advisa
ble to rescind the Olney order and to matte
it impossible for officers of the army, more
particularly at the present time, to ob
tain special passports. The reason for
this was so obvious that Secretary Sher
man acted favorably upon the suggestion.
Hereafter when the War Department
requests that special passports be issued
to officers they will be made out. The new
order from the State Department will say
that special passports will be granted army
officers when application for them is made
by the Secretary of War.
A scheme is under consideration at the
War Department which proposes to make
more uniform and consistent regulations
relative to the examination of officers of
the army for promotion. All officers of
the army are aware of the fact that there
is now a lack of uniformity in this direc
tion. r : â
Tne , examination of officers of the line
differs in manner from that of officers of
the ordnance corps, and that of officers of
that corps is not such as is directed for
members of the signal corps, nor do the
rules for the examination of staff officers
conform to the system prescribed for the
line in many particulars. The idea, of the
officials seems -to be to draw up regula
tions which will more specifically define
the order of the examinations, possibly to
modify the scope' somewhat, but more
particularly to provide in what subjects
there shall -be an oral examination, in
what written examination, etc.
- Adjutant-General Buggies has tbe sub
ject under advisement. it is understood
that he will shortly submit to Secretary
Alger a proposed order in the case. Gen
eral Ruggles, since the existing law went
into effect, has given the matter of the
examination of officers careful considera
tion. As a result of study and inquiry,
he is especially well informed a's to the
requirements. . No radical changes in the
regulations are contemplated. The prop
osition being considered looks especially
to a change in the regulations which will
insure greater uniformity in methods.

demonstration of loyalty and affection for
the venerable sovereign.
Business was entirely suspended
throughout v the day, , and " through the

priated by the municipal authorities and
subscribed by ;; the citizens, ; the smoky]

driven to; the new town hall. /; Here, with
out ; leaving Â« her I carriage, : she received
loyal addresses of greeting from the cor
"-â¢oration; the Cutlers' Company and - the
Town Trustees.* A keyboard was then
placed in her Majesty's lap, a wire leading
from the doors of the town hall attached
thereto, and with -. a press of : her ; thumb
upon the electric button the big doors
opened > Inwardly on their hinges, while
cannon boomed and the immense crowd
cheered; itself hoarse. ... ;
Although a frequent occurrence in the

has definitely declined to grant a bonus to

Sir William Van Home is expected here
at an early day to finally close the matter.
The Canadian Pacific people have fought
hard against the terms of the Government

MASSILLON", Ohio, May 22.â "General"
J. S. Coxey, not discouraged by his expe

new administration has now bad nearly
three months In which to. rede.m its
pledges that it would bring prosperity to

Plead Ignorance of Customs Laws
'and Say They Were Concealed
for Safety.
NEW YORK; N. V., May 22.â Richard
M. Scruggs, head of the Scruggs, Vander
vcort & Barney Dry Goods Company of St.
Louis, one of the wealthiest dry-goods
businesses in the West, was arrested yes
terday along with E. J. Langhorne, by
custom inspectors of the American line
pier. The prisonei s had ; just arrived on
the St. Paul, and had declared that the
value of their dutiable baggage did not ex
ceed $25. : As Langhorne, who is asso
ciated in business with Scruggs, was start
ing down the gangplank one of the in
spectors noticed his waistband bulging
peculiarly. He was searched and so was
his companion. On Langhorne was found
a linen belt containing jewelry, which the
Custom-house officers estimated to be
worth $2500. It consisted of watcnes and
diamonds. In Scruggs' pockets were
found more jewelry, all ot which was
seized.
After they had been searched they were
taken before United 'States Commissioner
Shield?. They made no attempt to deny
their possession of the jewelry and waived
examination. Each was held in $2500 bail.
Scruggs said later:
; "I was told in London and Paris, where
I bought these articles of jewelry to bring
home to some of my friends, that I would
not be required to pay duty on presents.
I was careful to ask this at every store. I
had \ never been to Europe before and
knew nothing about such matters. The
entire value of what I bought would not
exceed $1400. I was told on the steamer
by various passengers that presents were
not dutiable. Langhorne put them into a
belt which he had worn all through our
trip, because he thought they would be
safer than in our trunks. He carried the
funds for our trip all the time, and as we
drew our money in gold the belt was
bought to hold the money."
Scruggs is vice-president of the Inter,
national Sunday-school Union, is some
what over 70 years of age and well known
for his charity.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 22.â The news of
Scruggs' arrest created t:,e utmost sur
prise in commercial, social and religious
circles, in which Scruggs has for fifty years
enjoyed the greatest respect. Scruggs is a
multi-millionaire and has been identified
with every movement that contributed to
St. Louis' greatness as a municipality.
He is noted for his devotion to religious
and benevolent work. He is one of the
pillars of the Southern Methodist Church',
a director of the St. Louis Exposition and
a director of the State Bank of St. Louis,
one of the strongest financial institutions
in Missouri.
Charles E. Barney, vice-president ol the
Scruggs, Vandervoorl & Barney Dry Goods
Company, was so shocked when the tele
gram was shown him that he could hardly
speak. He denounced the arrest as an
outrage.;" ' ' '-".â¢'.' "â  ' â  â â -.-'-*'.,â¢

CONSPIRED TO
COMMIT MURDER
Most Sensational Case
of Two Well-Known
Pennsylvanians.
Attempts Made to Blow Up
the Residence of Levi
Waller.
Poison and Diphtheria Germs Also
Employed In Vain to Remove a
Troublesome Litigant.
: BLOOMSBURG, Pa., May 22.â Not
since the trial and conviction here in 1887
of Hester, Tully and Mcllugh, Molly
Maguires, for the . murder of Alexander
Rea has there been a case that attracted
so much attention as that against Lloyd
S. Wintersteen, a prominent attorney, and
Clifton Knorr, son of a leading lawyer and
citizen now deceased, which will come up
for trial next Tuesday. They are accused
of attempting to blow up ex-Representa
tive Levi Waller's residence with dyna
mite on the night of September 10 last.
, â  After Knorr's arrest at \ . Reading on
Christmas day he turned State's evidence
and created a profound sensation by alleg
ing that Wintersteen, who is a well
known member of the Columbia County
bar and president of one and director of
two or three other local industrial con
cerns, was the prime mover in an attempt
upon the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Waller
and the tatter's parents, Hon. and Mrs.
Charles R. Buckalew, who formed part of
the Waller household. Knorr said that
Wintersteen offered him $5000 to place
dynamite beneath the porch and blow up
the house. On this confession he and
Wintersteen were indicted February 2 by
the Grand Jury under seven separate bills,
charging them with several forms of at
tempts to kill. The case was continued
until the May term, bail in $7000 being
required of eacb.
At that time Knorr made another state
ment, charging that while: acting under
the directions of Winter-teen he not only
put an explosive under Waller's porch,
but had previously sought to shoot Waller
with a revolver. More sensational than
this,' however, were Knorr's self-confessed
attempts to put his own stepmother out
of the way by the introduction of poison
in her tea and by placing diphtheria
eerms among her clothing. The wit
nesses who will be produced in support of
the latter charge are Mrs. Mary Knorr,
the intended victim, and Nora Boharter, a
girl employed as a domestic by Mrs.
Knorr. Two attempts were made to poi
son the woman, and both failing, a plot
was concocted to secure diphtheria ba
cilli for the purpose. This also failed.
The commonwealth's attorneys know
where the poison was purchased, have the
revolver, know where the diphtheria
germs were purchased, and possess letters
sent to Knorr by Wintersteen during the
time the former alleges they were working
their murderous scheme.
The motive alleged for : Y.intcrsrven*
desire to get rid of Mrs. Knorr or Waller
was to end a suit in equity filed by-Mrs.
Knorr, charging Wintersteen .with mis-
management in the settlement of Colonel
Knorr's estate. The colonel, who died in
1889, had been Wintersteen* s law partner,
and Wintersteen was made executor. It
is expected there will be a big legal battle
when the case is called for trial. No less
than 150 witnesses have been subpenaed.

JULIAN RALPH MAKES LITTLE
OF THE WAR.
If Not an Opera Bouffe Affair the
Greeks Have Made It Largely
Theatrical.
[Copyrighted 1897 by the New York Sua.]
LONDON, E.\-g., May There has
been absolutely no development in the
general Eastern situation during the past
twenty-four hours and none is expected
until a further opportunity to exchange
views between the Embassadors and the
Porte. The eventual terms of peace will
be such as Russia and Germany see fit to
impose upon the Sultan. The influence
of France can be exerted, if at all, only
through Russia, and that of England will
be ignored both at Stamboul and other
capitals.
A doubtful feature of the situation con
tinues to be the attitude of the Sultan and
rejuvenated Turkey. There will be a
grave difficulty in disbanding the im
mense Ottoman army now mobilized with
out treating it even to a taste of Christian
blood. It is a problem to face which the
Sultan is said to be at hi- wits' end. It is
still urged in his behalf that he is willing
to do the bidding of the powers, that is,
the Czar, but the doubt, of his ability, as
well as his disposition, to comply con
tinues to increase. It is no longer possi
ble to ienore the fact that Turkey went on
mobilizing an immense force long after
the defeat of Greece was an assured, if not
accomplished, fact, and no legitimate ex
planation of this action is yet forthcom
ing.
The first war correspondent who has
returned to London is Julian Ralph, who
recently aevurad his .American newspaper
connection. He was on the Turkish side.
Although he enjoyed the eccentricity of
going to war in a landau, the vehicle was
seized by the Government for an ambu
lance. He says the truth concerning the
Turkish part in the war will not bo known
until the correspondents leave the coun
try. Ralph adds:
"The war was a small affair. If not an
opera bouffe war the Greeks have at least
made it largely theatrical. The battles
resulted in a few prisoners, fewer ,
wounded and still fewer killed. If the
Turk? had permitted the correspondents I
to send the figures the trivial character
of the war would long ago have been ap
parent. The Greeks early lost all spirit â
if they ever possessed any. They held a
magnificent defense at Milouna Pass and
Velestino, and at the latter place actually
repulsed the Turks, yet they abandoned
their stronghold and also ran like rabbits
from Pbarsala. The whole war has been
used by Turkey as a medium to assert a
new position among the European na
tions. Long after it was apparent the
Greeks had no stnd Turkey continued to
pour men into Macedonia end Thessaly.
Sue added 60.000 troops after it was evi
dent the army could whip the Greeks
hands down.
'â¢To-day the whole route from Salonica
to Dhomoko is blue with an enormous
procession of re-enforcements that will
number 300,030. men when all reach the
field. Two hundred thousand reserves
are in readiness to proceed to the front.
This mobilization completely throws the
war into the shade. It means Turkey's
readiness for a greater war. It means her
determination to show the Christian
powers that Turkey is no longer willing to
play the part of dunce in the European
schools. Turkey seems, like Greece, to be
able to successfully defy the concert and
wage war without permission, and means
to profit by the example. This is the
most serious situation Europe has seen in
nearly th'rty years. It. may Pass off
harmlessly if the timid Sultan dremisses
his present advisers, but it seemed to me
the temper of most men of the ruling
class was altogether in sympathy with j
this newly developed spirit of inde- I
pendence and pugnacity. On every side I j
heard Turkish officers boast that Turkey
meant to keep the land bought with Turk- j
ish blood, and those Europeans who hold
relations .with the Turkish Government
told me that Turkey had been crazed by
the new power she feels and means to as
sert a new" relation toward the rest of
Europe." " '
TO PROTECT ROYALTY.

SALONICA, Turkey, May 22.â The Aus
trian warship Stefanie has been ordered
to proceed to PhaJerum, near the Pirreus,
without delay. It is supposed this action
was taken to place the ship at the service
of the Greek royal family, in case it is

appearance excited a great' deal more

unteers were sent to the front at once,
the Government's view being they will be
safer there than at Athens. All the
Greek irregulars have been disbanded
with the exception of Chief Patsalongo
and his crack corps.
According to the stipulations of the
armistice a-jreem-nt a commission of offi
cers of the Greek and Turkish armies have

AS TO RIGHTS OF WOMEN.
Ccmment of the London Press on the
R.fusal of Cambridge to Recog
nize the Fair Sex.
(Copyrighted, 1897, by t< . Ne v York Sun.]
LONDON, Eng., May 22.â The battle for
women's degrees at Cambridge, which
ended yesterday in an overwhelming de
feat, made even a greater stir in England
than last year's struggle at Oxford. The
vote cannot fairly be taken to represent
public opinion even among the university
men. Thus the Daily News, which cham
pions the women's claims, explains:
"The vote of the absentees is supposed
to keep universities in contact witb the
general views of society, but this is an
academic fiction. There might be some
truth in it if the right of voting was pos
sessed by every graduate. This is far
from being the case. Those who do not
care to spend money for becoming masters
of art or to get rid of paying annual dues
are disfranchised without regard to their
intellectual . capacity. It is the clergy
rather than the laity who have decided
that Cambridge would be demoralized by
giving degrees to women, and the clergy
still have the worst judgment of human
affairs among all who can write and
read."
The Times, on the other hand, congratu
lates Cambridge on the decision and
adds: "We have reached a turning point
in the history of ""higher education for
women, and the time has come for a com
prehensive settlement of the whole ques
tion. It is only by the creation cf a sepa
rate university that the real solution can
be found."
CRISPI BEING HARD PRESSED.
Scandals Connected With Banks That
May Cause the Downfall of Many
Prominent Men.
ROME, Italy, May 22.â The enemies of
Sigt. or Crispi, ex-Prime Minister, are still
pressing him hard in connection with the
bank scandals. 'His wife was a witness
this week before the court investigating
the matter, the prosecution being desirous
of obtaining .from her an explanation of
her private banking account, it being
charged that she was the recipient of a
large part of the money her husband was
accused of illegally obtaining while he
was in office. Judging from indications
Crispi's political life is ending, out he, will
diehard. He doesn't deny that he re
ceived immense sums of money from men
with whom as Premier he should have
had no dealings, but it is certain this
money was not all for himself. It is be
lieved when he goes down he will drag
with him men who ore now high in politi
cal life, and also one, if not more, princes
of- the royal family. He is making a bit
ter fight, but the odds are against him.
bPAIX'S LATEST BVDGET.
Some -ttnni/ Figuring to Repair the
fxhattered finances.
MADRID, Spain, May, 22.â The budget
for the coming year shows tho estimated
receipts at 883,278,781 pesetas and expend
itures at 873,865,877 pesetas. It proposes
the imposition of a provisional war sur
tax of 100 per cent on tributes, with the
exception of those from landed property
and the interest on the redemption debt.
it is also proposed to establish a twenty
years' monopoly of import and export dis
tillation and the sale of petroleum. The
Government will have the exclusive sale
of powders and other explosives, on which
it is proposed to base financial operations
necessary to reshape the extraordinary
budget. BecanÂ«e the loan agreed upon
with Rothschild was not realized it is pro
posed to authorize the Government to
conduct a similar operation, either di
rectly or by tender, and to organize a tax
on shipping that will produce 12,000,000
pesetas. -V .
RXZACKWALL lUANEI, OPEKISG.
Traffic I* Formally Set in Motion by the

LONDON, Exn., May 22.â The Black
wall tunnel, which was completed at a
cost of Â£1,250.000, was formally opened by
the Prince of Wales in the name of , the
Queen this afternoon.
The Blackwall tunnel connects the two
sides of the river Thames at Blackwall,
six miles east of the Tower Bridge in Lon-
I don, and was built to relieve the conges
[ tion on tbe city bridges, which had be
', come too greatly crowded.:
The work was begun in 1891. The tun
nel is 6200 feet long, of which about one
fifth is under the river and the rest is in
, the approaches. It is twenty-seven feet in
diameter, and is said to be tne widest tun
nel in existence. It is eighty feet below
j high-water mark, and the fact that it had
to be constructed in loose, gravelly ground
made the undertaking a very difficult one.

LONDON. End., May 22.â 1t is reported
from Hyderabad that the historic dia
mond sold some time ago to the Nizam of
Hyderabad lias been stolen and replaced
with an imitation in paste. It is believed
that it was the intention of the Nizam to
preset the diamond to the Queen. The
"ViaCoria Imperial" or "GrÂ«*at White"

It was sold to the Nizam five years ago lor

of the disappearance of the jewel may be
the Oriental method of avoiding a com

President McKinley Gets
Fresh Reports From
Consuls.
An Increase In the Number of
Americans Who Need
Assistance.
It Is Apparent the Appropriation of
$50,000 Wilt Not Last More * .
Than a Fortnight.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 22.â The
President is still devoting most of his
time to Cuban affairs, but there is noth
ing to indicate he bas decided the details
of his policy. It is pretty certain, how
ever, he will not take positive action until
the report of Special Commissioner Cal
houn is received. : He will probably; be
back in three week**. Meanwhile. Presi
dent McKinley is reading consular and
diplomatic correspondence bearing on the
subject and consulting political friends.
He had a long talk this afternoon with
Assistant Secretary Day, who has direct
charge of all matters relating to Cuba.
It is apparent that McKinley is using
the present agitation of the Cuban ques
tion to thwart office-seekers, whose im
portunities have become a source Vof an
noyance. One Western representative in
Congress said he wanted : to speak with
tbe President about the distribution â¢of
patronage in his district, but be was put

independence of Cubans. *" ; ~

ligerency of the Cuban insurgents, but
wouldn't tell anything else except that

Information was received from Consul-
General Lee to-day showing the President
and State Department that the appropria
tion of $50,000 for the relief of aistressed
Americans will b? inadequate. Lee tele
graphed that Consul Brice at Matanzas
had reported 257 Americans destitute
there and Consul Barkev at Sagua4s3 at
his post, and the Consul-General esti
mated reports from other places will swell
the number to ,1200. This is greatly, in
excess of the figure anticipated by the
President when he sent the message to
Congress recommending the relief appro
priation. Ten thousand dollars has
already been placed at the disposal of Lee
and the remaining $40,000 will not go far
toward giving assistance to the regiment
of unfortunates who are suffering from
the effects of the war.
Lee's first reports about the number of
people in need of assistance were conserv
ative compared with his estimate to-day,
and the State Department thought two or
three hundred would be about : the' fall
number' of Americans who needed aid.
The appropriation, it is now believed, will
not last more than a fortnight.
Miss Clara Barton, accompanied by
George : H. ; Pullman, financial secretary of
the Red Cross, called at the State Depart
ment, but she said her visit had nothing
to do with distributing supplies to suffer
ing Americans in Cuba. Miss Barton told
a reporter the Red Cross had not been
giving aid In the .matter and were not
offering its services, because she believed
they word not necessary. - . * â  .
Something authentic about the call of
the Spanish Minister yesterday on Assist
ant: Secretary - Day. f was j learned .to-day.
Senor de Lome had seen in some news
papers that United States Consuls in Cuba

NEW YORK, N.Y., May 22.â A Presi
dential; election is in progress in the re
public of Cuba to-day, .' but owing to the
turbulent condition of the island it has
been found Impossible to "choose the new
executive by, popular vote. The civil con
dition of Cuba at' present l , is., simply .of
necessity. :, The island is now divided into
four States. .Each State has a Governor
with limited power. : * " I*V.
; The â¢? ~ Governor . : will consult with
other officers of state and will appoint
delegates to an electoral colleee. This
Presidential Congress will then vote for
the President and Vice-President. The
number of delegates is determined. by the
"population of the States.
Dr. Eusebio Hernandez, one of the most
prominent candidates for the Presidency
of the Cuban republic, is regarded with
favor by his countrymen in America. Of
the other two candidates Cisneros and
Masso, the former is more popular, and
the Cubans here think he will be elected
for another term. Masso is now Vice-
President.
Dr. Hernandez is â¢ a native of the
province oi Matanzas and is 44 years
old. When the revolution broKe out
he went with Gircia* on his ill-starred
Hawkins expedition. He reached Cuba
with Garcia on his second expedi
tion in the Bermuda. The Cubans
offered him a position as representative
in South America, but he preferred to
remain on the island, and accepted the
Foreign Affairs portfolio in the Cabinet of
President Cisneros. He left that office to
become if private physician in the field to
General Gomez, a position he still fills.
His wife, the daughter of a Cuban mil
lionaire, lives in this city. %He will prob
ably be elected Vice-President.

FITZ PROVED THE
BETTER PUGILIST
Won Fairly, According
to the Verascopic
Pictures.
At Few Stages of the Fight
Did Corbett Have an
Advantage.-
The Fourteenth Round Is Remark
ably Vivid, but There Is No
Sign of a Foul.
NEW YORK. N.Y., May 22. -If Corbett, '
as has been claimed, had the advantage in
the fight at Carson until Fitzsimraons
dropped him with a body-blow in the
fourteenth round, the verascopic pictures
as seen by a great crowd to-nisbt do not
show such a condition. The general
opinion was that Fitzsimmons proved the
better pugilist and won fairly. The
pictures are remarkably good.
. The first pictures shown upon the can
vas show the entrance of Coibett and
Fitzsimmons, together with their train
ers, in the ring. Before the first bell
sounds, Jim and Bob walk in front of the
verascope and bow, both smiling good
naturedly. Fitzsimmons' refusal to shake
bands is plain enough. Then the battle
begins. To the surprise of the crowd Fitz
simmons began forcing matters, and Cor
bett for the first three rounds was seen to
be on the defensive. If anything, Fitz
had the better of all these rounds, accord
ing to the pictures. The fourth and fifrh
rounds seemed to be in Corbett's favor.
Every one was anxious to see the sixth
round, for Corbett has made many claims
that he was deprived of a verdict by rea
son of the slow count. The picture shows
Corbett forcing matters and Fitz appar
ently blocking swings and clinching. In
a sort of a clinch near the further side of
the ring Fitz is suddenly seen to slip on
his knees, his arms around Corbett's legs.
As Siier begins to count off the seconds he
pushes Coroett away. Fitz seems to be
coolly waiting for a chance to rise. He is
far from groggy and when he does stand
he Degins to fight back strongly.
Daring the next half-dozen rounds Cor
bftt appears to be growing tired, while
Filzsimmons, on the other hand, seems to
be gaining strength.
"This is the fourteenth round," said
the young man who had been describing
the ; c.ures.
"Watch now for that foul blow," was
the remark heard on all sides, because of
all the alleged pictures published re
cently.
"There he goes!" was the cry, as Fitz
finally put a terrific left into the pit oi
Jim's stomach. As Corbett began to sin-
Bob made another motion to hit him with
his left, but whether he landed or not no
body could tell, for the pictures did not
show it. k
"Where's the foul?" shouted the crowd.
"Fake!" howled many persons, but
they were quickly silenced by a picture
of Corbett on bis hands and knees, his
face horrible with agony. .*; ' \\i '.~ : .
Films were also taken of tho incident
where Corbett rushes across the ring in
frenzy and strikes Fitz in his corner.
This forgetfulness was received with
hisses. ... â - -â 
AUS AUTO'S POOLROOMS.
In Lieu cf Licenses, Their Proprietors
Will Be Fined and Permitted
to Remain.
SAUSALITO. Cal., May 22.â Next Mon
day is the day on which the poolroom
operators will open their gambling dens
in Sausalito. Everything is in readiness
for them, even to the courts of justice.
Prosecuting Attorney Adolph Sylva was
seen to-day, and was requested to state
what action the town authorities would
take to put a stop to the illegal business.
Said he:
"As soon as they commence to soil
pools on the races 1 shall instruct the
Town Marshal to arrest the principals,
and I shall prosecute the cases and pro
cure convictions if it is a possible thing,
and I believe it is.
"I do not think that the poolmen can
be run out of Sausalito. While we may
procure convictions against them the
limit of the fine that can be imposed is
$300. In this town there is a divided feel
ing. The residents on the hill do not
want the poolmen to do business, while
the business men in the town and those
living on the water front are anxious to
have them to come to town, as they spend
considerable money here. However, the
Town Trustees cannot, under the ordi
nances now in force, exact a license from
the poolmen. . :: -:-.-" -â â¢'%?* 'â â ?:*.
"It is my intention to arrest the men
and, on their conviction, they will be
fined an amount sufficient to cover what,
they would pay in licensesâ say $250 a
month. By doing this the town will lose
nothing, and as to compelling â¢ the pool
men to leave town that is impossible.
Tbey wiil undoubtedly pay their tine, con
tinue business, be arrested again and con
victed a second, third or any number of
times."
The Western Union Company has com
pleted its arrangements by which the
poolrooms will be connected with direct
wires to Eastern tracks. The companies
which have signified their intention of
opening on Monday are Harrison & Co.
and Abrahams & Co. M. Schwartz is still
loosing for a place wherein to begin busi

HPACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May Wilh
its second day's session concluded, the
Pacific Grove Students' Conference gives
promise of even greater success than was
anticipated with the beginning of the
meetings. The college men are settling
down to the work â and the pleasure, also â
that has brought them together. The
"hillside meeting," so popular at Caza
dero last year, have been instituted, and
that of to-night proved to be one of the
most enjoyable features of the day.
The first session of the second day was
held this morning at 8 o'clock in the
Methodist Episcopal church. Its feature
was tne instructions given to the mirsion
ary institute of the convention by Robert
E. Lewis of Chicago, who is also this
year's secretary of student volunteer
movement and a graduate of the Univer
sity or Vermont. .Mr. Lewis' subject was,
"Why Should Christian Associations Pro
mole Missions?" lie brought out six
prominent points: First, that missions
constituted business matters and life
of the church, and if the church
was to live it must be missionary.
He quoted Max Mulier, president of Ox
ford University, as substantiating his
point. Second â In these college associa
tions were the majority 'of men
from whom the church ' got
its missionaries. Thirdâ The - purpose
for which tne association was -founded
was given in the Paris nasi** presupposing
that all associations would be missionary.
F'inrthâ He brought out forcibly that stu
dents had been leaders of missionary
work since the beginning of the Christian
era. Fifthâ That leaders of the churches

of to-day looked to colleges for men beet,
fitted for the missionary field. Sixth
The life and power of church work came
from the impetus given it by college men.'
Mr. Lewis also said that it was not large
numbers of delegates that was wanted in
these conventions, but picked leaders of
the college association workers. Mr. Lewis
will have entire charge of the missionary
training classes during the present con
vention.
At 9:30 o'clock in the south chapel Mr.
I Michener discoursed at length and very
| ably upon Bible study. Hi- talk was ad
dressed to the students' delegation meet
ing. This class seems so far to be the
most successful of the conference and is
most largely attended. Mr. Michener in
the course of his aadress made one point
very strongly felt by his hearersâ that no
education, college or otherwise,. was com
plete without at least a superficial knowl
edge of the Bible. Speaking merely from
a literary standpoint, no education could
be called well rounded without such
knowledge. The moral point and the
reason for Bible study in college courses
he also dwelt upon ably and at length.
The Bible-class, which is in charge of
Robert F. Lewis/was conducted by him
j at 11:30 o'clock, immediately after the
' platform meeting. Mr. Lewis said among
j other things that he found that the great
| est need of college as-ociations was suit
! ably trained leaders for Bible-classes, and
1 that therefore the leaders of this confer
encs would endeavor to make the Bib
classes one of its principal features and
would devote much lime throughout the
convention to equipping men for this re
sponsible work.
Most of the delegates ha vine never be
i fore visited . this locality, the recreation
j time ibis afternoon was devoted to riding,
I driving, boating, swimming or whatever
j kind of pleasure best suited each particu
j lar man. â .''"*â "
The students were particularly pleased
with the famous 17-mile drive and the
magnificent ground-, surrounding Hotel
del Monte. Many places connected with
the historic and romantic past of the old
Spanish town of Monterey were visited by
tne delegates. The athletic recreations,
such as will be announced in each day's i
programme, will not begin until Monday,
but almost every kind of sport in which
college men excel will bo indulged in here
during the convention.
The life-work conference was held at 7
o'clock this evening, and was well at
tended. Marked interest was shown by
the delegates assembled under the pines
in the twilight discussing the various call
ings, secular or . religious, which wero to
be their life work. The object of these
meetings is to h-*lp young college men to
make wise choices regarding their future
business or profession. " They will be ad
dressed by prominent business men as
well as by the conference leaders.

DEATH OF CAVILL,
THE WATER KING
The Aquatic Champion
Dies in His Favorite
Element.
Drowned While Giving an
Exhibition in Stockton
Baths.
Essays to Remain Under for Three
Minutes and is Brought
Up a Corpse.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 22â Charles
Caviil, the world-famous English swim
mer, was drowned to-night at Jackson
Baths, south of this city, in the presence
of 400 people, while giving an exhibition.
He was slated to stay under the water for
three minutes, and to-morrow, when it
was anticipated that the crowd' would be!
lar.er, he was to have tried to break his'
own record of tiva minutes and five sec
onds under water.
After giving several exhibitions of fancy
and fast swimming it was announced that
Caviil would go under the water and re
main there for three minutes. Every man
In the crowd who had a watch drew it out,
and when the word was given and the
swimmer went down in the deepest part
of the baths every man began counting off
the minutes.
Hardly a person in the throng spoke as
one minute e!ap ed and the ripple made
by the great swimmer smoothed over and
the immense pond was smooth as glass.
The manager for the swimmers who are
here called out the half-minutes and min
utes. â ' ' â¢ ' ' '
: One minute, then two, then three, and
then the spectators began to hold their
breaths, as they supposed \ the swimmer
beneath the water was doing. ' Four min
ute* passed; and some one ventured the
remark that Caviil intended to break his
record to-night instead of to-morrow.
When five minutes had sped by and the
breathless throng was watching every rip
ple, the manager called out the time in a
loud voice and whistled as though to sig
nal Caviil to come up.
Tho crowd began to believe the whole
exhibition a fake and to treat it as a joke.
If the Englishman hail come up then tney
would never have believed that he had
been under the water all that time.
Seven and a half minutes elapsed and
the manager frantically sent for Kahn,
one of tho exhibition swimmers, and told
him to dive for Caviil. The crowd
thought this part of the fake and laughed
as Kahn went down repeatedly. Even
his fellow-swimmers, who were giving ex
hibitions here, were not certain bnt that
he was playing a joke on them.
Nine and a half minutes had elapsed
when Kahn dived for the last time, and
this time he brought up the body of Caviil.
The swimmers at once saw that the
Englishman was drowned, but the crowd
thought at first that their efforts to revive
him were part of the fake, and said so. It
was soon evident that such was not the
case, and dozens of willing bands began
the attempt to bring the swimmer to life.
Work as they would tbey could not put
life into him. Dr. Manly and Dr. Hinkle
were summoned. For "an hour and a
quarter they worked over Cavil 1, assisted
by the spectators. Every known remedy
was applied. 'â ' An electric battery . was
brought into requisition, and nothing was
left undone that might be done to bring
the man to life. :; During that: hour and a
quarter the crowd ktood about -the room
in which the physicians were laboring
over the drowned man. One woman
fainted, and others had to leave the scene;
; . A curious incident in connection with
the drowning is the fact that just before
Caviil went down he was asked by a spec
tator to write something on a slate under
neath the water.;; He asked what to write
and was told to write the day of the wee k.
When ihe l came { up ' after doings this he
tossed theslate on the i side of the baths
and said : :.:* . r :,-â¢_-.- .--..â . ;?-'. ;...-.-
â -;â  "Stturday; "that all ri-*ht?" - ''â â  s
The word was written in chalk and the
slate was so wet that it could not be read.
Alter he was brought to -the* surface I in J a
drowned condition Frank Butters picked
up tbe slate, which then dry," and read
on it the words "I die." Tula Is the con
struction placed on the writing by some*
but others' be'ieve it to be the word "Sat"
unlay" poorly written. .",:S'\"-;^. : - :: -'J^- i
It was 11 : 15 o'clock when the physicians
finally gave the swimmer up. Caviil leaves
a wife and child in San Francisco.
CAREER OP TILL.
Ihe Aquatic Champion Came of a, Fatn-
Hy of swimmers.
Charles Caviil was without doubt the
peer of all modern swimmers the undis
puted all-round aquatic champion of the
world. Although but 26 years of age be
bad won over a hundred championships
in various parts of the world. On account
of his having acquired the appellation of
the "Australian phenomenon," it has been
generally supposed that he was a native
of the Antipodes. This is not the fact. He
was born in England, but was taken to
Anstralia by bis parents when a child. '
Caviil came from a family of swimmers.

REDDING, Cal., May 22.â The first

upon five miners, temporarily cutting off
the retreat of the remaining fifty- five. The

the mine through other passages.
'those who were fortunate enough to
escape without injury at once began the

to extricate them four hours later.
Each of the buried men had received
more or less injuries. They were at once
;a_en to the hospital of the Mountain
Copper Company at Keswick, about six
miles northwest of Redding, but before i
the hospital was reached Martin Sanders, I
who had been badly crushed and lacer
ated, expired.
The others were found to be seriously
hurt one miner, named Tompkins, hav
ing received injuries which may necessi
tate the amputation of his lower limbs.
Martin Sanders, the dead miner, was
formerly a resident of Reno, Nev., where I
( his family now lives. His body will be ;
sent to that point Sanders was 45 years
of age. He was a member in high stand
ing in the Royal Arch degree of Masonry. i
The Iron Mountain mine, which is the !
immense copper deposit owned by the ;
English Mountain Copper Mining Com- |
pany, is known to have been timbered un- !
safely, and the present catastrophe has
been expected for some time. A big suit
for damages will probably be instituted !
as the result of to-day's accident.

Powers and Mother Is Caps zed
bf a Typhoon.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., May 22.â Captain
John Picken and Adolph Adolphsen ar- !

Bonita from Eedondo, bringing news of
the loss of the schooner Ida, owned by
Miss Jessie Doddridge, a daughter of Cap- i
tain Henry Doddridge of this city. The
Ida left San Diego on April 22 for Cedros
I land to get news of Dr. Powers and his
mother, who were alone on the island and :
were beiieved to b.* in distress. There !
wore three sailors ana the captain aboard |
the little vessel. They arrived at Cedios
on the 28th and lound Powers and his
mother all right. They left on May 1 for 'â 
the south side of the island for a load of |
guano, but when about fifteen miles off j
shore the little schooner was -truck by a i
sort of typhoon common in that latitude I
and capsized.
By the most heroic efforts the captain !
and crew succeeded in getting the dory j
loose from the schooner and finally
reached shore more dead than alive, j
After beaching their dory they painfully â .
made their way back to camp, where they
remained with Dr. and Mrs. Powers until
May 17. when they succeeded in signaling
the steamer Orizaba on its way up the
coast from Central America. They were ;
transferred to the Bonita at Redondo.
The Ida was driven ashore on the rocks i
and is a complete wreck.

Economy in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal ;- May 22.â
business of examining an.l committing in
sane persons is of such importance in Los
Angeles that the perquisites attached
thereto are much sought after. The phy

examination, but as they made too much
money at that rate the Superior Judges of
the county have ordered that each medi
cal examiner shall be allowed in lieu of
fees the sum of $5 a day or session for his
services while actually engaged as such
medical examiner, as provided by said
act, the same to be in full for such ses

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
22.â A gayly dressed crowd of students
and visitors; numbering several hundred
witnessed the annual baseball game be
tween the seniors and faculty from the
long row of .bleachers surrounding the
Stanford diamond. The team represent
ing the graduates won easily by a score of
23 to 7, although the early part of the
game was hotly contested. The faculty
nine displayed excellent team work, and
the players wore ail bacKed up fairly well
at ? critical 'points. They , had difficulty,
however, in "finding" the seniors', south
paw pitcher, and when they did connect
with . his deceptive curves good ; fielding

THE SAN FRANCISCO ; ' CALL, | 'SUNDAY, MAY 23, 1897.
Last year the 'senior's were dressed as
plantation negroes. The team this year
was in Chines, garb. A huge wash
basket, covered?, with A linen carried
the baseball paraphernalia. , s Some: of the
members of the team wore queues,
their antics amused the crowd immensely.
After having.piven their yellâ

They retired to don the regulation base
ball uniform. -
In the first inning the faculty, owing to
lack of coaching, failed to ; score. - After
that Dr. Jordan always kept a man on the
side line to prevent similar disasters. The
seniors had better luck on coming to" bar.'
Well-placed hits 'by" Price, Leach, Davis
and "Jack" Rice netted them three runs.
In the second inning Professor Hoskins,
who usually has a good batting; eye, struct
out. Professor Green of mathematics was
given his base on balls. r Young of chemis
try hit safely to center field, and G. Marx
ol ' the engineering department was given
his. base on balls. J. C. Fish walked to
first, bringing- in a run. : Dr. Jordan, who
was dressed ia a becoming pair of knick
erbockers, hit the ball with his old-time
skill. Three* runners crossed the home
plate b-fore the side was retired. c(
Meanwhile a crowd of students had
gathered in one quarterof the field."- They
were â¢'blocking lor the faculty," as they
announced in unison. A rival crowd
asked if they had ! their university credit,;
examinations having occupied the atten
tion of the students during the past week.
"No,", they * shouted, i; "but may =; be 'we
will.";; And Dr. Angell, : captain of tha
faculty nine, smiled approvingly. 4 One of
the seniois, who had managed! to reach
first after -a 'hard run* was informed by a
crowd talking in 'unison- that there was a
schooner awaiting him :at second. This,
of course, awakened : a -response from
another quarter that there | were two at
third, and, after a pause, a keg at home. : C
â  From the third inning to the seventh,
when *t be game ! was 7 called, the seniors
hit Dr. Angell Â«; freely, and withy each :
inning the gap between the scores of the
two teams steadily widened. The teams
played aggressive ball throughout. When
ever Dr. Jordan made a good playâ and
I some of his catches bordered on the sen
! national he was as pleased as one stu
j dent expressed it as if he had discovered a
i new fish. ; Clairstrohn '99 ran ; the bases
! for ; Stanford's president. The Teamed
! teacher frequently forgot his runner; and
ran to first base himself.
Professor Guido Marx was a sure man at |
second. Dr. Richardson caught for the
faculty team and played his usual good
game. All of the faculty, members distin
guished themselves at some stage of , the
game and were loudly applauded. ".
Harry Hazzard, captain of Â»; the senior
team, got the most possible from bis team
and set- an example in heavy bating.
Davis, Brown, Leach and Rice were in the
game -from siart to .finish. The other
member** made a creditable showing.

ARIZONA'S RAND IT HUMORIST.
Train-Rzbber Parker Offers a Reward for
the Body of a Sher.ff Who Is on
His Trail.
PHCGNIX, Ariz., : May 22.â Bandit
Parker has turned humorist, and by way
of satirizing the Governor's and 'Sheriff's
reward for him has posted notice of J a re
ward ; that he ; will spay; for the body of
Sheriff Ruffner. â  The Sheriff is persist
ently following Parser's trail, though the
Hualapai '; Indian ; trailers : have > deserted
their work out of, fear for Parker's deadly,
bullets, and the mountain sheep-rangers
are protecting the jail-breaker by driving
their herds over his tracks. V. - '
Sheriff Ruffner and his posse have not
lost the original trail, however, which
now leads into the heart of Bill Williams
Mountain. â  Parker x has ;* been 'pressed so
closely that he lost his; hat and dared not
stop to pick it up. I Sheriff Ruffner is now
wearing i the 1 hat as ;a | souvenir, and de
clares he will wear none other until he
has caught its owner. â¢-.
":â â . .When the Indians left i the trail the
posse pushed on without? them and soon
came up to a piece of I paper stuck on a
sagebrush. Prompted :by .curiosity Ruff
ner halted and picked it up. "lt had been 1
placed there by _ the : outlaw and these are
-the words it contained: >
A reward of $1000 is offered by the under
signed for Sheriff Ruffner, dead or alive; dead
preferred.** Au additional reward ot $10 each!
will be paid for the killing of me poodle dogs
that have been on toy trail. - -.-.v-? 'â .â Â»,-. â "'

: Al Galpin of Phoenix,; who went out on
the trail with a pack of bloodhounds, has
returned. He says it is impracticable for
the dogs to follow Parker. The outlaw
has a host of friends in the Bill William
Mountains and they are doing all in their
power to assist him to escape. They are
protecting , the bandit in many covert
ways and are even making threats against
the officers of Williamsjfor their vigilance.
When Gilpin left the trail Parser had,
worked his way into the bells Canyon
country and was making tracks for the
Utah boundary line. Once this is crossed
or even the northern side of the Grand
Canyon ; reached i* the \ fugitive will have
gained comparative safety.

VISITING THRONGS JOIN IN
THE CELEBRATION.
Far Into the Night the Citizens and
Their Guests Continue the
Revel.
HANFORD, Cal., May 22.â The San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road has come to Hanford, and the event
has been celebrated all day and is still,
now late at night, being celebrated with
the most extravagant manifestations of
joy. The people of the whole country
flocked into and overrun and almoÃt
swamped this live little city, not to speak
of the hundreds who came by the special
trains from points as far distant as San
Francisce. The Stockton Commercial As
sociation and the Chamber of Commerce
and the Hundred Thousand Club of
Fresno, sent large delegations of represen
tative business men, all of whom wore
badges distinguishing their several alle
giances. Fortunately the sky was over
cast and a light breeze lent itself to the en
couragement of the general joy. It is
very well, that it was so, for the crush
upon the streets, in the very, thick of
which were - hundreds â of women with
babies in arms, many of whom had trav
eled far to make a part of the big demon
strat-on, must have been otherwise at
tended with serious results.
It was a big, big day in Hanford, and it
demonstrated as fully as its projectors
could possibly desire that the people of
Kings County aapreciate at its full what
t c Valley road means to them.
The dawn was greeted with the booming
of cannon, calling the people of the city
up to prepare for the coming of the multi
tude. And it was none too early, fur the
sun was not up before the first wagon of
the distant rancher or vineyardist turned
into the main street and took its post in
front of the nark. By 9 o'clock so many
had followed in its track that the line of
teams extended all round the park and
on into neighboring streets, while their
freight of men and women and children
were already crowding the sidewalks. And
still they came by every description of rig,'
by bicycle, on horseback and on foot. .-'j j. ,
Where the newly made railway crosses
Seventh street the anticipated first train
was expected to stop, and there the crowd
centered. The executive committee, city
officials and other prominent citizens
were there in their private rigs or on foot
to receive the officials of the road. The
company of uniformed Knights of Py
thias was drawn up in line to serve as an
escort to them and to the two companies
of the National Guard' from Fresno which
were on the train. . .
Shortly after 9 o'clock a fleck of smoke
on the northeastern horizon set a small
boy to crying, "There she comes!" People
are cautious about (-mail boys, and they
waited, watching, all excitement. The
spot grew and grew and became a dark
ribbon strung across the wide acres of
Lucerne vineyard.
There was no doubt about it now, but
still the people held themselves in re
straint. Then a plume of white steam
sprang straight toward the sky from the
nose of the engine that was now in easy
view. There was a pause between the
sight and slower traveling sound, and
there fell upon the ears of the waiting
multitude the long, strong, vibrant scream
of the engine of the first passenger train
of the Valley road thundering down into
the city of Hanford.
It was like a yell of triumph. It sounded
to the people like victory's essay to spell
the word "emancipation," and they broke
into a great cheer."
Men were waiting at the cord of every
steam whistle in town and at every bell,

Lady in Hanford, Who Represented King-, County in the
Demonstration Celebrating the Coming of the Valley Road.
and with the scream of the locomotive,
which was the signal, such a din and
clamor was set up as set the windows of
the town rattling. People poured from
the houses and hotels and hurried toward
Seventh street, until that thoroughfare
became impassable.
The train stopped, and the Valley road
at Hanford was an accomplished fact.
The cbeering and the blowing of whistles
and ringing of bells continued for some
minutes, while the soldiers and the guests
got down, and carriages, and foot formed
into line and marched uptown, the visitors
dispersing to their several hotels and the
officers of the road taking their quarters
at the Artesia.
The Dig parade was scheduled for 10:30
o'clock in the morning, but as another
train was required to bring all the visit
ors who desired to attend from Fresno, it
was postponed until afternoon. In the
meantime the crowds from Visalia and
the surrounding country kept, coming.
The band .played- in â¢ the park and ti.e
Fire Department beguiled the ; time by
giving an exhibition of the Holly system
on upper Seventh street, while a great
throng besieged the hotel dining-rooms
and the restaurants.
The second train, bringing a new con
tingent from Stockton and. Fresno, ar
rived shortly after noon, and "the strug
gle for bread*' had a new impulse.
At 2 o'clock the industrial parade, which
had been forming on the side streets since
noon, was given the word to move. The
procession was one designed particularly
to interest the visiting officers oftne Val
ley road, representing as it did the busi
ness interests of Kings County that has
been a source of income to the Southern
Pacific of $-100,000â a round half millionâ
a year. There were wagon-loads and
wagon-loads of sheep and wool and wagon
loads and wagon- loads of win**, and.
wagon-loads and wagon-loads of raisins
and grapes and fruits, and .other wagon
j loads of cheese and other dairy products.-
Besides the industrial features there
were those of the spectacular Californian
parades â the wild riders, bull-fighters and
the Chinese. Sheriff W. V. Buckner was
grand marshal, with B. S. Gumel chief of
staff and Peter Van Valer, G. E. Shore,
Howard McGinniss, Harry Bernstein and
; Frank Hafley aids. Lew Crittenden had
command of the second division.
The National Guard companies from
Fresno held the post of honor on the
j right, followed by the uniformed rank.
Knights of Pythias, of Hanford. These

j Miss Ella Coffee, witn her maids, six
| young ladies all dressed in white and car
rying white parasols, the queen being
quartered high under her canopy and
wearing a golden crown, while the ladies
of her court sat in a picturesque group
about her.
The float upon which they rode was
I very handsome. The maids of the court
were: Miss Rose Rider. Miss Dollie Cof
.fee. Miss Addie Coffee, Miss Belle Peacock,
I Miss Grace Lilian Rider, Miss Gussie New

[ . A float tearing a bevy of young girls
I representing the States followed, -and
another carried a class of the Union High
| School - girls.': Then came a gallant com
pany of women on horseback. ' A covered
wagon, handsomely decorated, was la
beled, "The Woman's Club," and bore
I the legend, "Deeds, Not Words.''. A
wagon bearing the words, "Kern Connty,"
contained a party that was never tired of
repeating to tbe people along the route:
"You are teaching us a great lesson; you
are teaching us a great lesson."
The fire department had its place in tbe
line ahead of the industrial floats, and fol
lowing them came Ramon Cheon and his
company of bull-fighters and equestrians.
Finally came the Chinese contingent with
THE SAN FRANCISCO A CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 23, 1897.
| its golden banners and tinsel and noise,
and then the bikes.
Altogether it was a notable procession,
lt moved through the principal streets of
the town and passed in review, counter
marching on Front street and the park
before the grand stand, where were the
president 01 the Cham of Commerce
and the officials of the Valley road and the
Postal Telegraph Company. .Mayor Phe
lan, who was expected, did not come.
On the stand there were the following,
who had come by the first train: Robert
Watt, vice-president of the road; Capt. A.
__. Payson, second vice-president; Thomas
Magee, director; J. E. Hooper, director;
Alexander Mackie, secretary; E. E. Pres
ton, counsel; W. B. Storey, chief en

eli White, trustees; L. W. Storror, super
intendent of the Pacific; Postal Tele
graph. Company, and H. : C. Bush, gen
eral agent of tbe Atlantic and Pacific Rail
road Company.
General regret was ; felt and expressed'
because of the inability of President Claus
Spreckels to be present.
When the procession bad passed, E. E.
Manheim, president of the Chamber of
Commerce, addressed the people, saying
that the occasion of gathering was one of
the greatest gratification to the citizens of
I the county. Although - but four. years old
I it might be sad that Kings County was
j fairly out of her swaddling clothes, and
j what had this day been accomplished
j would certainly speed her on the upwaid
I road to prosperity. He introduced Hon.
j Justin Jacobs as the spokesman for the
people of the county., "'" *
A bit of irony lay in the fact that this
I celebration of the incoming of the Valley
road was being held almost In front of the
office of the Southern Pacific because of
the location in the park there of tho band
stand; yet the fact ;'Â» had . its com
pensation in the annoyance; which the
ringing of the bells of the engines of the
road caused the speaker. However Judge
Jacobs was persistent and made himself
heard to the end. He said :
This is a day of great joy for tne people of
Kings County. Our rej. -icing should be twe
lold, for we "are here to celebrate two of the
most important events that have transpired
in the history of the prosperity of this section
of the State the creation of the new county of
Kings and the entrance into our county of the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road.. -*.-â .- 'â --'..' . ?-' - ',
While our county of Kings* still remains the
youngest in the State it is ty no means the
I least in any particular. In the matter- of
wealth Kings County is No. 20, leaving nine
teen below it. The celebra'.ed Lucerne Vine-
I yard is the largest raisin vineyard in the
I world. It employs an average of about 200
hands during the entire year. During- the
season last past, which was an unfavorable
one, it shipped 140 carloads, or 1400 tons, of
raisins, besides 1000 tons of grants to the
wineries of Fresno. In the Kimball orchard
we have also tbe largest prune orchard in the
world. Its shipments lor the past season
amounted to 175 carloads, or 1750 tons. ; .
Perhaps the greatest burden that has been
imposed upon this, as well as nearly all other
sections ol tne State, x has : been the excessive
rates for transportation. It seems to be the
prevailing opinion . that it has been the dispo
sition and intention of the company having a
monopoly of the carrying trade heretofore ito
charge what the traffic would bear. : While
fierhaps it would be Improper on an occasion
ike the present to denounce, or even call Into
question the business methods of other trans
portation companies, yet it would seem tbe
proper occasion to call your . attention |to - the
proposed plan ol conducting business upon
the part of tbe new company that has just
reached us with its line of road. I now. quote
the language of tbe president of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad: : i*__Ss_r
The way into San Francisco .is open to us by
more than one route and there Is nothing that
can prevent our entrance, though the route
will be a surprise to many people. There
will be no trouble about finances. We have
money enough. at â  ur command ,to go right
ahead building the road, whether we dispose
of bonds or not. Â There are many enterprises
in which a return ot 0 per cent could be made
on capital invested, but -'prefer this project,
as it will tend to develop the State to an ex
tent greater than anything else that could be
done by public or private enterprise. I have
no doubt that - when 'â â  the roadbed is . properly
ballasted there will be no trouble nt all in
running trains at the rate of sixty miles an
hour. â _: It is one of the finest | roads 1 ever built,
as all the materials and trimmings are of: the
best and latest make. It now ; remains ,with
the people to dtclde whether the road shall be
the mUest kind of a success, and from what
has aiready transpired I have every confidence
that we have now, and I shall ; always continue
to have, the support of the people. They, as
we, lam sure, fully realize ;tnat our interests
are one. The greater the patronage extended
to us the lower will be our rates, for we are
pledged, as they know, not to charge more
than will return 6 per cent on the money in
vested in the road.
When we take into consideration the fact
thai during every year there is, or heretofore
has been, paid out of the county of Kings up
wards of $900,000 for freight alone we can
begin to comprehend in some slight degree
the enormous profits which accrue to any com
pany having a i monopoly "of the carrying
traffic of the great San Joaquin Valley.
, The Valley Road is being constructed and
fully equipped at a cost of about $20,000 a
mile. The Southern Pacific, or, more properly
-peaking, the Central Pacific, between Goshen
and Latnrop, is bonded for $00,000 a mile. Its
original cost-to the company was probably
not le s than $40,000 a mile. As to how these
matters came about it is hardly time nor the
occasion to discuss. Yet, without going into
the question of a charge or rate of "ail the
traffic will bear," it will readily -bo seen that
it costs much more to Day interest on $100,
--000 than it does to pay interest on $20,000.
The advent of the Valley road has already
reduced freights and, fares about one-third.
How many of us, the people of Kings County,
are there who fully realize that the construc
tion ot the new road means a saving to
Kings County of about $300,000 per annum,
or nearly three times the amount paid each
year for taxes? How long this condition of
affairs will continue is for the people to de
termine. Mr. Spreckels, the president .of the
road, truthfully says:
"The people's ~ interests and '* ours ' are : one.
We are pledged, as they (the people). know,
not to charge more than will return 6 per cent
on the money invested in the road." .' -^
We all know what have been our rates for
the past twenty years; we know what they are
now, and wo i aiso know the source whence
our relief came. Our rates for both freights
and far.s are now ut a very reasonable basis.
The time will undoubtedly come when the
present rates will be cut. Should the Valley
road receive the patronage to which it is just
ly entitle- its competitor will, in 'all proba
bility, endeavor to cripple the business of it
rival by cutting below a living or paying rate
on the carrying traffic. Then will come the
test, and the question will be submitted to
the people, as all questions of this kind finally
are. to "determine whether the Valley road
shall be maintained ata paying rate ot 6 per
cent on the capital invested, or whether it will
be compelled to form a' combination with its
competitor for self-protection and put the
rates back to where they were before the Val
ley road was dreamed of. '
Whenever the shipper or producer avails
himself of an opportunity to ship his goods
for less than the actual coat of shipment, by
reason of the cutting of rites upon the part
of rival transportation companies; he may ex
pect to more than make it uo in the long run
if he is a regular shipper. So if the competi
tor or the Valley road, cuts below a paying
rate, : and by reason thereof you haul your
freight there to save a few dollars, don't make
a great fuss if you compel the roads to com
bine -gain and put on "all. the traffic will
bear." "''.'"
â¢ 'But we look for better things. Once more,
to use the language of the president of the
Valley Railroad Company:. "We have every
confidence that we havo now, and shall always
continue to have! the support of the people."
With that support nothing but success can at
tend this enterprise both on behalf of the
company and the people as well. ' -â¢ ;.- r : r _.i
Vice-President Watt was called upon to
speak in behalf of the road. He did so
briefly, expressing fir*, his deep regret at
the absence of President Spreckels.
.."When we came here a year, ago," he
said, "you promised to lend your aid -in
granting us a right-of-way, and in re
sponse we said wo would bring the road
here and we have done so. The warm ex
pressions of welcome manifested here
to-day would indicate to us that, the rela
tionship of the railroad and the people
will be mutually gratifying."
The speaker said he would give way to
Mr. Preston, the solicitor of the company.
Mr. Preston made a short address, every
word of which wap to the point. He said
that the spirit or California was strong
and progressive, and. no bands even 01
railroad steel could confine it.
Another epoch in the history of the
State had been marked when the San
Francisco and '- San .'Joaquin Valley Rail
road had opened a pathway from the
fertile plains of the S?.n Joaquin Valley to
God's free highway, the sea. Continuing,
he said :
And it has not been done for gain. I would
impress upon you this fact that the men who
built this road are not railroad men. They
are men such as you are yourselves â mer
chants and manufacturers. They did not
build it ' because they wanted to build and
operate a road. They built it because they
felt it a duty to their State. It was forced upon
them; they built it out of the misery of Cali
fornia.:
I do not say this in any spirit of prejudice
against the other company. | Railroads are not
built usually through motives of philanthropy,
but when the pressure of monopoly becomes
such as to check the natural growth of a state
or a | people, the bonds will at last burst, and,
released, they will proceed on to their natural
destiny. As I have looked over this fair State
of ours and saw how, despite Its splendid re
sources, it has languished and grown faint,
noted that its course nas tended downward
rather than on and up, I have fretted and
grown impatient as you have. As a Califor
nlan I have been eager to see the day when
the great State should be free to work out that
destiny that is Hers by right, and I feel it to be
the best ' fruition of my manhood that I have
been a part of the active agency in bringing
about tne era of Us new life. ,
. It is for you now to da your share. Your
own prosperity under the new conditions lies
with you. The new road is something of the
commonweal; -it came from .the people and is
with the people; it is going to merit the peo
ple's confidence. How often have you ex
pressed a doubt .that this ' road .would * ever
reach here? How often have you said it would
never be a competing roadâ -it would be
sold out? Let me ask you, are your railroad
fares reduced? Are your freight tariffs lower
than they were? Have you not better coin
modations? Then have you nÂ»t a competing
road through this land that God blessed when
he made it? [A voice, "And we'll stay with
you."* % That : is: all 'we I ask. * You have stood
here long and' been patient, and I shall not
detain you further. God bless you.
When the applause subsided Chairman
Manheim proposed tnree cheers ; for the
Valley road, and =1 they, were given with a
tiger and the gathering was dismissed.
:,;A-; bullfight on - thei cards for the later
hours of the afternoon attracted a great
crowd xto an arena on the outskirts of
town. Not much was expected of it, but
it proved to be quite an exciting entertain
ment Tbree bulls were put through tbeir,
paces by four matadores. One of the bulls
showed unusual "agility and ugliness.
Twice one of 'the matadores' fell in front
of the enraged- animal and once il was
thought he had been killed, the bull strik
ing him fairly. -, / '
â  His fellows rushed to his assistance, as
did also a body of horsemen held in re
serve for such emergencies. The specta
tors rushed to the fence about the arena,'
and in several places it broke down. The
excitement was intense. The matadore
clung to the bull's horns and neck, and
finally succeeded in disabling him. When
all was over the gored matadore was found
to be only slightly injured, and did not
leave the arena.
7 To-night the demonstration was con
cluded with an illuminated bicycle parade
and : the Valley road officials' were ban
queted at ; the Aborn. At a late hour the
celebi ation was still in progress. -:
Chief Engineer Storey stated to-night
that trains would be run on regular sched
ule in about ten days. â¢ The time would
be reduced between here and Fresno from
three hours by the Southern Pacifio to one
by. the Valley roau and Hanford would no
longer be a sidetracked town.
With the coming of the road comes also
the Postal Telegra*ph, granting the people
competition in the matter of telegraphic
communication as the road does -, in that
of transportation. The Postal "has en
gaged offices in the Artesia Hotel build
ing. -The Santa Fe also opened offices
here to-day for the first time, N. W. Hall
taking charge as freight and passenger
agent, v 'â ; ,;'.-. .;".'â ".â â¢.'.,"â .â .
"The Valley road will push ; on to
Bakersfield," said Engineer. Storey to
night; "It is reasonable to suppose that
same transcontinental line will build to
Bakersfield and give us connection
through to the East. We can then handle
transcontinental freight. In the mean
time we undertak** to perform only what
we set out to perform that is, to grant
relief in the matter of local rates, which
bear the heaviest on the farmers. We are
doing that."
TOLD A YARN TO

Hotel Clerk Kavanaugh
No Longer Nevada
v-Â»- City's Hero.
Officers Puncture the Story of
His Fight With Two
Bandits.
Declare They Can Prove That He
and a Confederate Were the
Real Robbers.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., May Walter
Kavanaugh is â¢ : no Â« longer 'â -. the hero of
Nevada City. ÂT en days azo this 20-year
old youth gained a reputation for bravery
by putting to flight two masked men who
had entered the office of the Union Hotel
to rob the safeâ at least, that was Kav
anaugh's story of the alleged, encounter.
Now the generally accepted opinion is
that the two masked bandit, existed only
in the imagination of the hotel clerk.
Since the affair in the Union Hotel,
the local 'officials have been active. For
two days after the alleged encounter be
tween Kavanaugh and his midnight
visitors a posse of ' armed men, aided ;, by
bloodhounds, searched the surrounding
country, but no bandits could they find. . '.,
The bloodhounds readily took up the
trail leading from the hotel, but after fol- \
lowing itfor a short distance from the city
they turned and came back. Evidently
the robbers had not attempted to get away
from Nevada City, but bad retraced tbeir
steps and passed the balance of the night
within the limits of the town.
Now the officers ' have found evidence
which supplies strong grounds for the be
lief that Kavanaugh planned the attack
on the hotel himself, and was assisted in
its execution ,by a confederate. While
they were robbing the safe the young
clerk accidentally upset a money drawer,
scattering its contents over the floor.
The noise aroused J. Northway, the pro
prietor of the -'j hotel. Hearing him mov
ing about in Lis room, Kavanaugh's
confederate took flight, and the hotel
clerk, to give color to the story
that S ; he was attacked by robbers,
fired a couple of shots from his revolver
and ; scattered the furniture around * the
zoom in confusion. Just :as Northway
entered -the office he dashed out of the
door as though in pursuit of some one,
again firing bis revolver* at the mythical
robber. . *
This is the theory advanced by the offi
cers, and in proof of i< they offer.; an in
teresting exhibit. The sleeve of a duster,
said to have been worn by one of the rob
bers, was found near the hotel wrapped
in paper. '. '"'"â *'.-' â "*â 
The authorities have found in Kava
naugh's room the sheet which this bit
of paperwas torn. This is but a portion of
the evidence by virtue of which they de
clare that they can prove the falsity of
young Kavanaugh's story.
Kavanaugh will not be prosecuted, for
the reason that even though his story is
untrue he failed to get away with any of
the ; gold in the hotel safe. The young
man had not borne an unenviable reputa
tion heretofore. ;
. Several years ago he was .. convicted of
crime in Oakland and sentenced to San
Quentin. He was afterward transferred
to the * Preston : : School of Industry, and
after ; serving his term in that institution
came to Nevada City a year ago. Â.

The Fort George No Longer,
Flies the British
Flag.
Will in Future Carry Sugar
and Run in the Hono
lulu Trade.
Transformat on of the Old Pilot-Boat
Caleb Curtis Into a Pala
tial Yacht.
The ship Fort George arrived . from
England yesterday, completing her last
voyage under the British flag.: she has
been sold to parties In Honolulu and in
future will be reported as the Hawaiian
ship Fort George. Captain Adam, who
brought her out, will retire and according
to report Captain Morse, late of the Ala
meda, will assume command.
The Fort George is an old trader to this
port. Ten years ago she was here in com
mand of Captain Hanna and when the
latter gentleman went into the steamboat
business Captain Tureen took command.
When the Fort George was sold she was
turned over to Captain Adam, and he
Drought her to San Francisco. The Fort
George is a very handsome vessel and well
appointed. She is not a fast sailer and no
record-breaking trips between here and
Honolulu may be expected irom her. V'
The old pilot-boat Caleb Curtis has been
heard from again. Now she is classed as
a yacht and is used by the upper ten of
Hongkong on special occasions. Years
ago the Curtis was well known on the bar
and in the bay. Then she became too
slow for the service and was sold to a
party of seal-hunters. One trip to the
coast of Japan disgusted .the hunters and
they sold the vessel to a man who was
newly married and had money to invest
in a South Sea island trading cruise. His
bride handled the venture, and when she
had secured all the funds she deserted her
husband in Hongkong and came back to
San Francisco. The Curtis was sold, and
now the officers of the Uelgic say that the
boat has been transformed into one of the
handsomest yachts in the Orient.
The schooner Berwick, which left here
on the 19th inst. for Rogue River, had a
lively time of it. When off Cape Mendo
cino she sprang a leak and all hands went
to the pumps. The water did not gain
ground and the vessel was kept on her
course until the pumps choked. Then the
schooner was put about and run back for
San Francisco. As soon as possible she
will be placed on the drydock and thor
oughly overhauled before again being sent
to sea.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Umatilla arrived from Puget Sound ports
yesterday. On this occasion there was no
tilt between hs quarantine officers and
the steamer was allowed to dock at once.
Captain Hunter . reports a fair-weather
passage and no incidents of any note.
The renovated steamer Portland was
speeded around the bay yesterday and
made an excellent showing. On this oc
casion the guests were confined to the
friends of John Ko.ienield and his sons.
Koss & Hewlett's new gasoline schooner,
La Chaiena, bad her trial trip on the bay
yesterday. She is intended for the Fort
Koss trade, and quite a number of people
were down from that vicinity to sea what
the new boat can do. La Chaiena is
only a small boat, but has a 40- power en
gine, and is in consequence the fastest
vessel ot her class in the bay.
The United States steamer Concord
went into commission yesterday, and
when her stores are aboard will start for
Honolulu. From Honolulu she will go to
the China station, where she may end her
days. At one time it was said that tne
old warship would never leave Mare
Lland again, but it now appears that she
can fill a gap and allow one of the new
cruisers to fill a more important position.
Captain Honniheldof the steamer Hum-
I boldt has a small bill to settle with the
i Harbor Commissioners. While docking
at Third-street wharf the engines did not
I answer quick enough, and the vessel
j crashed into the structure, doing damage
to the extent of $50. Little or no injury
was done to the steamer.
The captain and cook of the Dirigo held
a reception on board : yesterday. There
were gay times on "the only American
steel sailing ship afloat" for a few hours,
and one of - the biggest sailors in the crew
was kept constantly on the gangway to
warn away reporters.
ThÂ» British ship Scottish Lochs from
Junin, Peru, for San Francisco, .was
spoken in latitude 14 south, longitude 98
west, by the Fort George. The captain
signal d the Fort George that his vessel
was very foul, and that she was making
slow progress.
Six months ago J. S. Kimball & Co. sent
the steam schooner Protection to Central
American ports to ascertain the chances
for a new steamship line, lt is now as

! A sad and strange death occurred in the
Yosemite Valley on Monday last, none of
the facts of which ! were known here till '
yesterday. Something over a week 'â â  ago
the steamer China arrived here from the
Orient.
Among her passengers were Colonel G. C.
Madden and A.N. Madden, brothers, of Cal
cutta, India. Tne colonel , has been many
year- in the .British army, and his brother
was for a long time' an - extensive tea
grower of Calcutta. \ The brothers were on
their way, alter long years of absence from
their native land, p to London, to meet
friends and attend the Queen's jubilee. \ ;
Having arrived here and being so close
to the Yosemite,; the great garden of nat- j
ural wonders ;of; which -they, had so long;
heard, they concluded to spend a few days
in seeing it. Â£ . They set out within a day or
two, and on arrivine in the; valley regis

began to see the sights, climbing some of
the loftiest eminences. : r '; :

Day Will Be Kept in
a i t/_Â» A**m
This City.
EXERCISES AT THE SCHOOLS.
Next Friday Afternoon a Summarized Biog
raphy Will Be Read at Every Center
of Education in San
Francisco.
The courtesy of Superintendent Webster of the Public School Department en
ables us to present the lowing contribution to the interest of the exercises in honor
of Abraham Lincoln, which are to occupy tie attention of our schools and their
friends next Friday afternoon. ,
No paragraph occupies more than two minutes â most only one or a little more.
Professor Ktiowlton writes on the subject as follows:
876 Shotwell St., City, Saturday, P. M. , May 22, 1897. ,
Dear Editor: With this 1 leave the copy for the paragraphic life of
Lincoln of which Superintendent Webster and I were speaking with
you in your office last evening. *
It is a rewritten compilation from the best authors with considerable
original composition. The style is progressive to fit the story, simple
and homely, if you will, from the simple and homely life of the lad
through youth and manhood to manhood's martyrdom. Every boy or
girl or young man or woman from the lowest grammar grade to the
highest normal or even university class, may find something of his or
her own caliber.
Of course the teacher can choose as many as prove best for the cir
cumstances of her class or her exercises â the paragraphs' in the
order of their number, call for them in that order and thus have a con
nected and symmetrical account of Lincoln's noble life.
The leading ideas are:
i. To furnish new material.
2. To give new forms to familiar material. ':.;.
3. To give as many as possible a chance to take part. -
4. To supersede the few long and often "borous" essays of pets.
Â§5. To show mercy thereby to long-suffering and helpless audi
ences.
Assuring you that you will do a very welcome favor to thousands
of pupils and hundreds of teachers. Very truly yours,
E. KNOWLTON.

Abraham Lincolnâ His Birth and Babyhood.
The life of Abraham Lincoln began on the 12th day of February, ISO 9, in a rude bit of a
log shanty on a lonely little farm in Kentucky.
That rough little iarm lay on both sides of Nolan Creek in what was then Hardin County.
They have- since divided Hardin County, so that that part of it now called Larue County takes
in Lincoln's birthplace.
Under one name or the otner we may find it on any good county map of Ken tucky. It lies
near the center of the northern tier of counties just over the Ohio River, right on the south
bank, straight across from Indiana. Look and see.
The country was very haud.ome. It had a rolling surface, well-timbered and fertile, well
watered and abounded in game, so that it was equally attractive to the hunter and to tho
iarmer. Shiny .Mountain anda larger one called Blue Ball were the first hills ou whicn the
baby eyes of Lincoln looked during their first two years on earth. ..\;*â.V;:c:
Two miles off was Hodgeuville, now the county seat of Larue County, to which tourists
who wish to see Lincoln's birtnplace have to go first.
The next five years he spent in another cabin, four miles from his first home, on Knob
Creek. This cabin was only a sort of a shed-shanty, little, if any, better than many a cowshed
lor California cattle to-day.
â¢ "*
His Third Homeâ How They Kept "Open House."
His Kentucky homos were beautifully surrounded, but they were not hoalthfuL Malaria
prevailed. So, when he was about 7. his father, Thomas Lincoln, took his whole family
across the Ohio to a new home in Indiana. This new home-farmâ or ranch, as Californians
would be more likely to call Itâ lay along both banks of Little Pigeon Creek, near the strag
gling settlement of Gentryviile, in what is now -pencer County, Indiana.
The first shelter they had there was hardly more than an Indian wigwam. In some
points it was not as good. It was just a sortof a low shed shanty of logs and brush. It had a
roof that was anything but tight, and one side wasn't there at all. It stood wide open, co
that the family didn't nee 1 any door or windows, and they didn't have any.
If a stray Indian, or even a roving bear, chose to walk in to dine or sup with the
family there was nothing to stop him, and the family didn't stay to welcome him. Or, if he
happened to take it into his head to make a midnight call, things became still more sudden.
Their life there was a sort of picnic all the lime. They didn't need either doorbell or
knocker. They kept "open house" all the while. . . *
In wiuter snows or summer storms Abe's mother used to hang up big buffalo skins
across the open side, and so keen out some of the wet and the cold. .You may be sure they
never lacked for thorough ventilation. â :-â :â â .*.. - . : *-â .-â¼

The New Lob Cabin With Four Whole Sidesâ lta Furniture.
After putting up with the shed-shanty about a ye->r Abe's father built a better. By this
time the lad had become nearly 8, so that he was able and glad to help. ?o was his mother.
Both the hoy and hi* mother worked out in the woods with ax and hatchet and maul, help
ing to build the new cabin, which had four whole sides to it.
And their furniture they made themselves, too. Abe's father took a big log, more than
two feet through, spilt it in two with wedges, hewed off the flat side as smooth as he could
with his wide broadax, bored holes in the other side and drove in four stout sticks for legs.
That was the table. Ii had no casters and it '-staved wbsre it was nut" we may be quite sure.
And the chairs came out of smaller logs in the same way. In fact they looked as If they
might be the own children of the table. The chief difference was that ihev had three lee*
instead of four. Perhaps the fourth one grew out when they grew older. Who knows? They
didn't call them chairs at allâ just stools. We may see something quite like them now In
almost any cowyard or shed Where the men milk.
No doubt Abe was big enough and strong enough by this time to help his father make
these thingsâ the table and the stools and the stands and the shelvesâ for we know he was
always ready and willing to do all he could to help others. ,

Abe's Bedâ How He Made Itâ How He Got New Onesâ Advantages.
Spring and wire beds and hair mattresses hadn't come into fashion ln his time. He and
the young colts and calves slept on the same things, dried leaves, grass or straw. : The- differ
ence was that they had to take them as they could fl.ua then, while Abe used to take a big
bag or sack and go out and fill it with the softest and best me. line leaves he could get. When
lie wanted to "make his bed all he had to do was just stand the bag up on end, square off at
it and give It a good punchingâ one-two-three styleâ he thougnt it soft enough and
plump enough for another good night's rest.
Whenever he felt like having another bed all he had to do was just pitch his bed-bag out
of doors, dump out the leaves lor the colts or calves to Use, step out into the woods, gather a
fresh lot, shoulder his sack, "take ui> his bed and walk" back to his airy loft. ; . i ,
His bedstead was the whole floor. It never broke down under him and it never creaked or
squeaked wnen he turned over or thrashed about. And he couldn't v ry well fall "out o"
bed," though no doubt he often rolled out and found himself sprawling all over the floor In
the morning, rubbing his sloeny eyes and wondering what made his bed so terribly hard and
bow he came to "have the floor."
V.
Abe's Work- His Supper and His Stairs.
All day long, from earliest dawn till latest twilight, he worked, helping his mother in the
house and his father around the place aud on the farm. In the house he was bis mother's
only girl for quite awhile, and outside his father could not afford to keeb any hired man.
For supper he had one big piece of corn bread. It was rare that he had butter on it or
even syrup; and it was often so dry that he had to "chew it fine" before he could swallow it
at all. Simple food, pure air and plenty of hard work gave him health and strength, as they
give any boy now who would dare to try them. , - ..
After supper lt was dark. He had no books to read nor any candle or lamp to read by*
and he had no neighbors' boys to play with, So the tired boy got slowly off his three-legged
strol, kissed his mother "good-nlghi" and climbed up a set of stout wooden pins driven into
the logs of the side of the cabin. hen he wanted to go up into the garret, or attic or loft he
had no stairs nor even a Udder, only the pegs already named; and he had no sort of trouble
turning off the gas, putting out the lamp or blowing out the candle, He climb d into the
dar_, threw off his clothes in a hurry, etrctcned himself out on his bag bed, pulled the rough

Death of Abe's Motherâ What He Said of .Her.
, Abe's mother was never strong. And her work never ceased. It was hard and constant,
and her food was not a< good nor her rest 'as . much as she needed. And husbands then, as
now, often seemed to think much more of taking care of a fine colt than of saving the strength
and the lives of their own wives. The family had not been in the new house quite a year
when she sickened and in a few weeks died of a quick consumption. "*â¢'â  _-*._'â¢'
Away out in the wilderness, as they were, they couldn't get any minister to attend the
funeral, and they had no churchyard or graveyard in which to lav her remains, so they had to
bury her (without any regular service) away out in the wools. Many and many an hour Abe
used to go out there to her lonely grave among the trees and sit and cry.
As soon as they possibly could they had a good ministerâ her friend, good Parson tlklnsâ
come and preach a tegular funeral sermon. . 'â â 'â Â».
His mother's death was the first really great sorrow that Abe had ever known. Many
years after, when lie had grown to be a man, he said to a friend with whom he was talking
(and his eyes were dropping tears as he said it): "God bless my mother 1 All that lam or ever
hope to bo 1 owe to my mother." f ;,;
VII.
Abe's Stepmotherâ "What She Said of Him,
A little more than a year after he lost his own mother his father married Mrs. Sally John
son of Kentucky, whom he had known there. She had three children, whom she brought
with her, and all of mem agreed, happily, with Abe and his sister. -'-;' ''.
The new wife proved an excellent mother to Abe. She found him poor, barefooted nnd
' ragged, and at once went at work to supply all his wants. She was thoroughly kind-hearted
and every way capable. And after Abe had grown Into manhood and become famous she
always used to say : "Abe was an excellent boy. He never gave me an unkind word or cross
look. And he never refused to do anything I asked him to do. Abe was tho best boy I tver
saw."
It is pleasant to know that she lived to see Abe become President of the United States and
to have the warmest proofs of the love that he always had for her as long as he lived. .

Abe's Backwoods Schoolhouseâ His New Teacherâ Beading by Open Fire
lightâUU Books.
A rough log schoolhouse stood quite a long way from Aba's home out in the woods. He
went to that lor a few weeks. There ne learned the beginnings of reading and writing. But
iiio fi of the pupils cared so little for learning that they got on too slowly for him. So he made
up his mind that he could and would "go It alone." Then he leu school aud became his own
teacher from that time on.
After the rest of the fam ily had gone to bed he used to heap the dry logs up on the open
fire, make a bright and steady blaze, pull his three-legged stool un near the corner of the
chimney and read and think. Sometimes, when more tired than usual, he would stretch him
self fiatou the floor, swing round so that the firelight would shine over his shoulder on the
book and lie there and read away till long after midnight. More than once he fell Â«-sleep ouly
to be sharply waked by a red-hot coal rolling against his bare foot. ,
His only books were the Bible (of which he could repeat large portions), "Pilgrim's "reg
ret's," "Robinson Crusoe." "iE-op's Fables" and th- -lives of Washington, Franklin and
Clay. He greatly admired Clay, warmly believed in his principles and strove for some years
to imitate and to emulate him. ~ ' ,

Abe's Shovel-Slate and Charcoal Pencil-Ills Will and His "Way.
Young ADe spent a good part of his evenings by the fireside in writing and ciphering or
"doing turns," as tho old-ia*hioned boys used to call working problems in arithmetic
His father was so poor ihat he could seldom afford to buy paper and pens for bis son ; so
that when Abe could not get goosequills to make pens of, and had no slate, he would take the
broad back of the wooden fire-shovel for his slate and use a slender stick of soft charcoal for
his pencil. As soon as he bad covered the back of the shovel with his copies, or "sums," in
arithmetic he would take it out to the shaving-horse and with the draw-knife shave it all clean
and smooth again, so that he could till it once more.
When his lather or mother complainedâ as they sometimes didâ that the fire-thovel was
"getting too thin" Aba used to take his ax and draw-knife out into the woods, cut down a tree
of the right sort and make a new one. There was no danger of running short on that kind of
slate as long as the woods lasted.
When a ;ad has the wil he'll contrive to find the way. If he can't find a way he'll make
one. Young Abe always did. Wo can. â  ;â -â ,â¢* Â«.._ : /*
â What Abe Could Do at 17â His Strength at 19.
By the time Abe was 17 he could write a .ood hand, do hard examples in long division,
and spell better than auy one else in tne county.
Once in a while he used to write a little piece about something he had been reading or
thinking Ã¼b iul and when the neighbors heard lt they used to say, ' Aha, hear that! Abe can
doit; the world can't beat it.' '. '
At 19 Abe had readied his full height. In his bare feet he stood nearly s'x feet four inches
tall. He was a long, lank, bony, awkward, good-natured giant. In physical strength he was
the master of the whole country round. No one in his neighborhood could strike an ax as
deep into a tree as be could. Indeed, few could pull it out after he had struck it in. In wrest
ling he was the champion, lie may have known very little of what our wrestlers call the
half-Nelson, but wheu he got a man in one of his Lincoln grips that man went down and
under. ,â¢'... : : ; {-.-"'â  .*r>
It takes a strong man to put a barrel of flour into a wagon. Lincoln did lt easily. Hardly

Abe's Ilutboat Trip to New Orleansâ How He Handled the Robbers,
About tni.s timeâ when Abe was 19â a neighbor hired him to go with his son, younger than
Abe, down the Ohio and the Mississippi to New Orleans with a flatboat load of corn and other
produce. Abe had charge of the trip and the accounts. They had nearly 2000 miles to go
and the trip took almost a month.
Abe was greatly pleased with the proposal and gladly accepted. lie had never been away
from home to any distance, and, like all young men, wanted to fee something beyond his own
home. He told his father that he "wanted to see the worid." His father shrewdly and cau
tiotiiugly replied: "Take care, my boy, that lv trying to see the world you do not see the bot
tom of me Mississippi."
Abe and his companion got through safely. But one night while their boat lay at the
levee, before they bad sold their load, a gang of negro roughs ca.no on board to rob them.
They did not know Abe. They became acquainted with him that night. He very speedily
showed them that he could handle a club as well as an ax. The thieving rascals, bruised aud
bleeding, were glad to get off with the. r lives. . .;'?'

Abe Moves to Illinoisâ Helps His Father Build â Country Frolic*.
Soon after Abe returned from New Orleans, In 1830, they moved to Illinois. The Indiana
home had proved unhealthy, and the labor of clearing off the heavy timber was too great. In
Illinois they could have broad prairies of rich land free irom timber. Tne next mouth after
Abe was 21 they moved with ox-teams 200 miles in fifteen days, into Central Illinois. There
they settled on tbe north side of the Sangamon River, just where the prairie land runs into
the woods.
Abe stayed long enough to help his father build a comfortable log cabin for the' family;
then he and John Hanks split walnut rails enough to fence a fifteen-acre cornfield, fenced it
in securely aud satv his father fairly started in the new home. Then he told his father that
as he bad now come of age, he must begin to work for himself. .He did so. : But he did not go
out of ihe neighborhood. He broke up laud, plowed, split rails, chopped wood around in his
own county. ' â â "â ' â¢.'-â¢â¢.-â â¢.-..-â  Â«\ â >?..;â  .'-â¢â â¢â *'â¢ â -â 'â¢.'â -. â â â ' â  . - â 
That country had few settlers and many wild beasts. When the men wanted recreation
they had a grand wolf hunt. They would set up a tall pole in a clearing. > Then they formed
a circle of men ten miles round. At the signal all began logo toward the pole, beating the
bushes and shouting and yelling with all their might. The frightened wolves and other
animals inside the great circle gradually crowded around the pole, where the men, closing
in oc them from all sides, shot them down in neaps. Our rabbit-drives down round Bakers
field are somownat like these. '']:::â ".'.'â¢â â  -Â,. ?'

Hnw Abe Made His Ax Pay for HlÂ« Clothes.
Abe didn't care much for hunting. He was too kind hearted. But he always did his part
to help destroy the animal pests that hindered settlement. Yet, after all, he liked the ax
much better than the rifle. The sett. ers had little or no money. They did business by ex
change or barter. When they wanted anything they would give something else for it or pay
for it in work. . v * .-â â â â 
Once, when Abewan'ed anew pair of trousers he made a bargain for them with a Mrs.
Nancy Miller. They made clothes then out of a coarse but very strong klid of towcloth,
wcven from flax or hemp, and dyed brown. It is not much to look at but it wears well und
long. In the great war the Couiederate soldiers came to. the army ln many cases wearing a
cloth something of the same sort. They called it "butternut" from its color. . /
.Abe told Mrs. Miller that he would split 400 good fence rails for her lor every yard of good
towcloth she would weave for him.
They closed the bargain ana that was the way in which Abe clothed himself with his ax.

Abe Keeps Storeâ Disciplines a Profane Bally.
This first year after he was 21 Abo hired out to tend a grocery and variety store in New
Salem. Tnat is o.i the same river, tne Sangamon, about twenty-five miles off from his home.'
While showing goods to three women one day a bully came. in and began to -talk very
offensively and profanely. 'He showed plainly that he was trying to pick a quarrel. Lincoln
begged him not to use such language before ladles. The bully replied thai he had found
! the chance he wanted, said he would say what he chose and would like to see the man â¢ who
could stop him. Abe kept perfectly cool, told him to wait till the ladles had gone, when he
would attend to his case.
As soon as the ladies had left the bully became quite furious and swore that he must have
satisfaction and have it ''right away, too."
. - Abe calmly replied: "Well, if you must have a good* thrashing. I suppose I may as well
give it to you as any other man."
The bully said that the man who could thrash bim was just the man he had been looking
for. So out of doors they went and Lincoln made short work of him. He instantly threw him
upon the ground, held him as easily as if he had been a child, reached out one of his long
arms, gathered a lot of the "smart-weed" which grew about the spot and rubbed it into the
bully's face and eyes till hn fairly bellowed with the pain.
As soon as he "hollered" that he had got enough and gave up Abe went and brought
water, helped the fellow to wash out the smarting stuff and did all he could for his comfort.
The outcome was that the bully ceased to be a buily, became Lincoln's stanch friend and
made quite a decent mau of himself. * . . .-';?.:-'' â â â  : , L :~ â :.

How He Came to lie Called "Honest Abe."
< His service in tho store was always so kind and polite that he gained everybody's respect and
goodwill. One day a woman made a mistake and paid him 0 cents too much. He did not
notice it at the time, but found it out soon after she had gone. As he could not leave the
store he waited till after "shutting-up time," then walked to her home, five miles out of the
village, and gave her bs< the 0 cents.
/Another lime, just astro was closing the store for the night, a woman came in and asked
for half a pound of tea. The tea was weighed out and paid for, and he closed the store for the
night. Wnen Abe came to the store the next morning, one of the first things he noticed was
a (our-ounoe weight on the scale instead of the eight i,e should have used.- As soon as he saw
his mistake he weighed out the other four ounces, closed the store and took a long walk be
foro breakfast to give the woman what she had paid for.
A man often shows his real character In smail things more than in greater ones. Honest
Abe was faithful and trustworthy in small things. Indue time he became ruler over great
ones. '.

Abe Captain In the Black Hawk Warâ Dry "Leavesâ What He Did In the War.
' In 1832 Honest Abe enlisted to fight the Indians. The war is called the "Block Hawk,"
from a leading chief of the Sacs. Af.er the meu enlisted for the war assembled they elected
Honest Abe their captain. Fortunately they did not have to fight, but Lincoln made himself
Immensely popular by the thorough care he took of his men, his never-failing good nature and
his ability to tell more stories and better ones than any man in the company.
One day, some time before the war, an Indian walked up to a settler's cabin, saying:
"Ugh! Ugh!: Too much white man! Ugh!" Then he threw a handful of dry leaves up into

Honest Abe used to say that the only, fights he had In this war were with the mosquitoes.
He said he never shot at a singe Indian, but "he saved the life ot one old savage. And he
seemed always a great deal better satisfied with himself for having saved that one life than if
he had shot twenty Indians through the head.
The Black Hawk War hardly merited the name of a war at all. - It made no military repu

In it afterward became President of the United Statesâ Zacharv Taylor and Abraham Lincoln.
Much more distinguished wars have turned oul much less noted meu.

How "Lincoln Saved "Young Armstrong From Hanging.
Lincoln was not only honest and truthful, he was shrewd and sharp. In a fight near where
he had lived a man . was killed. . One of . his.. friends was arrested for. the murder.
Everybody thought him guilty, and felt sure ho would hang. After studying the case Lincoln
made up his mind that the accused was innocent. His mother was too poor to pay a lawyer.
Lincoln wrote her that he wouid gladly defend her son for nomine. Â. .
On the trial the chief witness swore that he saw the prisoner strike the man dead. Lincoln
questioned him sharply. He asked at what time of the day he saw the murder done. Wit
ness said it was in tbe evening after dark, but he saw it all by the bright moonlight. "Are you
sure? ' asked Lincoln. am." said the witness. "Do you swear it?" said Lincoln. "1 do,
positively," said the witness. ' Then Lincoln took an almanac out of his pocket, op-ned it to
the place where the leaf was turned down, passed it to the court and the Jury wita the quiet
remark: "This aimanao shows there was no- moon shining at the time at which the witness
swears he saw the murder done." 'lhe jury saw. lhe -.witness -baa not told the truth, imme
diately declared the prisoner "not guilty," and he was at once set free. '
* The prisoner's mother had shown great kindness to Lincoln when he was poor and friend
less. Honest Abe always paid his debt-*. . " J/;.*- - ii....:
Eggleston works this incident into his story, "The Graysons."

Lincoln aud the Pig.
One fine morning Lincoln bought a new suit. Having put it on he started for the court
house to defend a lawsuit On the way he saw a pig mired in a deep mudhole. The creature
would struggle part way up the slippery bank and then fall back again over his head in mire
and water. Lincoln thought, "If that pig Is left there he will sure y smother to death." Then
he looked at his glossy new suit and thought again, "If I try to get nlm out I shall surely spoil
this new suit. I really can't afford to spoil this suit for any pig." So he rode on. Bui his kind
heart would not let him forget the struggling pig. Alter he had gone about two miles be said
to himself, "I have no right to let thai poor pig die there in that vile mud, and what's more I
won't either." He at once turned his horse round and hurried back to the spot. The poor pig
was still struggling, but had crown so weak that he cculd not reach as high as before. Lincoln
dismounted, carried a half dozen fence rails to the edge ot the hole and placed them so tbat he
could reach down' without falling in himself. Then fan not upon his knees, bent over and
reached those long arms of his down, seized the pig firmly by the foreleg* and pulled him up
onto the rails into safety. The pig, to - tired to stand, grunted out his best thanks as he lay
panting from his long exertions. Lincoln slid him and pushed him out of danger, and then
rode on, plastered with mud but happy at heart because he had done gooi even io an animal.

Lincoln State Legislator â Moves to Springfield Goes to Congress.
Soon after the war in 1834 many people in Illinois began to think they would like to have
a man like Honest Abe help to make their laws in their Stata Legislature. They elected him.
He accepted, but he was so poor that he could not pay horse hire to get to the capital, Van
dalia, so ha actually walked the whole distance, over a hundred miles. After that they elected
him many times, ana once more, at least, he walked the hundred miles to the State capital and
walked back again, another hundred.
In 1837 Major Stewart, a lawyer of Springfield and a warm friend of Lincoln, Invited him
to move to thai city and bf-come his law partner. . After considerable modest hes'tation Lin
coln accepted and lived in Springfield till he died, except while President in Washington. -,
The next time tne people elected him to efflce ihey sent him to Congress to help make
laws not for bis own State only, but for the whole country. He had got qui. c a long wav up
from the time when he had worked with John Hanks splitting rails aud fencing cornfields
around his father's cablu. But the people of the whole country were going to have something
to say about his destiny. He was going higher stillâ he was going to the very top.
XXI.
The Meeting for Naming a Candidate for Presidentâ The Two Fence Kails.
Chosen. President.
In the spring of 1860 the people had a great meeting in ono of the Illinois towns. They
had met to name a man whom they would like to see President. Lincoln was there. After a
number of speeches a man rose and said that there was some one there who wanted to give a
present to the meeting. The meeting voted that he might do so. Then John Hanks and ouo
of his neighbors brought in two old fence rails and a banner with these words painted on It:
* ; ABRAHAM LINCOLN, j :
i THE RAIL CANDIDATE FOR THK PRESIDENCY â¢
* IN* 15:60.
* TWO RAILS FROM A LOT OF 3000 :

â¢ BY JOHN HANKS AND ABE LINCOLN. J

â¢ .*...-, ,;....;..;. ..:..^..:. ............ ....... * . -
The meeting received the rails with cheer after cheer and chose Lincoln their candidate.
About two weeks alter they had a much larger meeting ln Chicago and chose him there again
in the same way. And then, when November came, the people of the country also chose
Abraham, the Illinois rail-splitter, for the President of the whole country.
It would seem as lf he hud quite reached the very top, would it not? But he was to go
higher yet. We shall see. .-."â¢

The Great Warâ "Why So Many in the South Wanted to Quit the. Onion.
In the spring of 1861, less than six weeks after Lincoln became President, came the terrible
war between tne Norm and the South. One strong reason why so many in the South wanted
to get out of the Union was the great change which had come aboul since 1770 in the way of
dome work in the North and in the South. At the time of the Revolution, when we broke
away irom England, all the States held slaves. They had them in the North as well as in the
South. And many mink that the North would have held them as long as the South if it had
â 'paid." But the North was too cold for the negro. So they claim tnat it was not as mucn
"Christianity" as "climate" that made thrifty New England give up slavery. â¢ 1
But, be that as it may, little by little the slaves of .the Norm became free, while those of
the South still remained slaves. So it came to pass that the whites of the North, having no
slaves, had to work with their own hands, while the Southern whites kept up the old way of
working with the hands of their negro slaves. More aud more, year after year, these different
ways of doing the work led to still more different ways of thinking about work and workers.
The South thought it menial and unmanly to work, looked down upon those whites who were
willing to work, and, finally, became unwilling to remain united with men who submitted
themselves to the hardships of labor suitable only for slaves.
ââ .... XXIII.
The Gulf Widens Ãebellion â Secession.
The North considered labor respectable, dignified, honorable. The South looked down
upon work. They deified laziness. They despised those who had to work or chose to worn
with their own hands. :
Tnls growing difference in the way they looked at manual labor made it more and more
impossible for "the South, as it-was, to live In union with the North. . So- the "irrepressible
conflict," as Mr. Seward phrased it, bad to come. It did. it came - sharply, suddenly,
bloodily. ' ' â -;â¢â â  â - . '-:,-;* : â â¢<â â â â  â 'â  .
: Thirty years before, in Jackson's time, South Carolina had proclaimed nullification . and
attempted secession. With colos al self-conceit aud tho incredible blindness that grows out
of it sne actually thought hcrselt greater than the whole Union besides. Her geometry stood
on its head. It fell over. She tried to make the part greater than the whole. Neither mathe
matics nor patriotism could permit, i-
But we may not blame her too severely. Our early history shows that there havo been,
others. Massachusetts did the same thing more than 200 years ago. When the first colonial
confederation resisted her attempted control she threatened secession. â¢.'.-:.'â¢
'_i "_ '..j '.."'UU- "**''.'-" ;**â "â¢---'. When refused her own sweet way, jr:-l^
,'..-,.,,; Bhe stubbornly refused to play. .
Fortunately for our history, when the self-willed little sister Carolina tried to make
trouble in the family, Andrew Jackson was its father. "Old Hickery" quickly took down his
military rod, flourisned it full in the little rebel's face, sternly threatened "By the Eternal" to
hang every traitor on a gibbet higher than Hainan's, and so speedily stamped out the Kindling
flame of secession. ,'Â»â '" -
XXIV. â¢
Secession "Revives, Extends Lincoln's Oath â First Gunâ War.
But, though the flame of secession disappeared, the embers still smoldered. The same
troublesome little State, encouraged by the blindness and inefficiency of the invertebrate
President preceding Lincoln, renewed he? tantrums; proclaimed secession, fired the first gun
at the heart of her parent and thus, attempting patricide, became the first armed rebel. Ten
other States followed the unfilial, murderous and suicidal. action of our "stormy-browed
sister," as Dr. Holmes called her. This attempt of these eleven States to break up the Federal
family caused the civil war for the preservation of tne Union.
" These eleven deliberately set themselves to destroy the Union. In the most forbearing,
tender, eloquent and loving message in all our history President Lincoln saia to them:
"You can have no oath registered in heaven to destroy this Government. 1 have the most
solemn one to pieserve, protect and defend it. ' *
"I am loth io ciose. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not become enemies.
"The mystic cords of memory, stretching Irom every battle-field and patriot grave to every
living heart and hearthstone over ail this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union
when touched, as they surely will be, by the better angels of our nature." '
But the willful, spoiled children would not listen. With clenched hands they struck their
father full in the face. That ended the time for reasoning or persuading. Their own insane
deeds compelled him to take the rod of stern discipline into his unwilling hand and to usa it
most sharply. Without becoming himself a traitor to liberty and freedom President Lincoln
could have done nothing else and nothing less than he did. The fcouth "struck the first blow."
The President bad to strike b-ck and to keep striking until he struck the last blow. And no
one is now gladder than the "new south" that be did so.
XV.
President Lincoln Frees the Slavesâ Peaceâ Deathâ Honor Fame.
. The North had more men and more money. The South had the advantage of fighting on
their own ground. They fought "on the inside."
The war lasted four terrible years. Millions of brave men, on both sides, took part in it on
land and sea. Thousands upon thousands of them were killed.
During the progress of the war Lincoln gave their freedom to all the slaves in all the States
then armed rebe.lion against the Union. He did this "as an act of military necessltv, war
ranted by the constitution." ._ ..
His proclamation .of emancipation is one of the noblest documents ever published in the
world. ..:.:
The war went on. General Grant became commander of all the armies of the Union ; Gen
eral Lee of those of the rebellion. I When the Southern leaders saw that it was useless or hope
less to fight any loDger they laid down their arms and made peace.
The saddest thing about the close of the war was the murder of President Lincon by a mad
man assassin named Boom. He killed Lincoln while others of his kind tried to kill Lincoln's
highest advisers and helpers. Booth was shot, the others hanged.
The best people of all the South wept with all loyal Americans over the murder of Lincoln.
They knew that their insane fanatic had killed their best friend. Had he lived he would have
reconstructed the Union far more speedily, pleasantly and efficlentlv than it was attempted by
the Ignorant, williul, narrow-gauge man who succeeded him. '.-. ..â â ;.
Lincoln's great, kind heart took in the whole country, the South as warmly as ihe North.
He loved both and loved all, ns every true American always does and must. And all true
Americans love Abraham Lincoln and delight to honor him this day as never before. .
. Washington was our Father. Grant our defender, Lincoln our preserver. All honorâ and
eternal honorâ to them aud to him! â --â¢:â :â¢',-.,. â - â  - % -*x

Â./."'/â¢---. .-â¢â¢V''--' Comparison Summary â Conclusion.
Washington was born richâ Lincoln poor. Washington had the best chances a lad could
haveâ Lincoln none. Washington had the strongest friends to help him into the best places
Lincoln lacked all these, v In all these respects Washington had a hundredfold the advantage
of Lincoln. .Remembering these. things ana others like them, and fairly considering the
dopths trom which he sprang, the obstacles he conquered and the heights he gained, we must
certainly conclude that Lincoln was at least as great as Washington. When we get the glamor
and the glare of historical lashion out of our eyes we may even claim that ho was greater
Certainly his life and his fame are far more encouraging to every struggling sou of honest
poverty and hereditary toil. ; "*..

120 MARKET &T.S.F^B__a^RICHMOND IS
STILL AGITATED
Disturbers of Last Friday
Night's Meeting Are
. Censured.
E. P. Troy Has Caused the Ar
rest of Tbomas Kerr of Odd
Fellows' Cemetery.
Prominent Citz-r.s of the Distric
Have Withdrawn From the Point
Lobos Imprcv ment Club.
Richmond is still agitated over the be
havior of an unruly crowd at Simon's
Hall last Friday evening, when the'me*t
ing of the Richmond Improvement Asso
ciation was disturbed by a disorderly
demonstration. The subject was dis
cussed ah day yesterday and last evening.
The Call was in great demand, as it con
tained an accurate and extended account
of the affair.
There may be two sides of the question
regarding the removal of the City Cem
etery, so the people out there say, but
they assert with positive clearness that
there is only one voice touching the dis
turbance of the meeting. All a--ree that
the conduct of the disturbers was out
rageous.
At Meinert's grocery store last evening,
and at other places in Richmond, the
neighbors talked the matter over, lt was
stated thai several citizens who had been
prominently identified with the Point
Lobos Improvement Club had cast their
fortunes with the Richmond Improvement
Association since last Friday night. Tbe
latter duo gained eighteen new members
night before last and yesterday.
Messrs. Troy, Fitzgerald and,Ginley,
three former -supporters of the Point
Lobos Club, had joined the club of which
('. H. Hubbs is president and J. G. Ma
loney secretary. - ; ;7 Â .. : .V V ,
A well-Known and leading merchant of
the district, who has always actea with
the Fletcher organization, told a Call re
porter last night that bo had chanced his
view*, and would hereafter train witn the
people who favored the removal of the
City Cemetery.
He did not care to have his name men
tioned, but frankly said that the citizens
composing the Richmond Imprbvement
Association never disturbed any one else
âthat they never thought of interfering
with the meetings of the other club.
Secretary Maloney said last night that
the disturbance wa-; particularly unfortu
nate for Richmond, because many ladies
who had recently moved into the district
attended a pubic meeting there for the
first time. They were shocked and dis
gusted at the howling and guying of the
disturbers.
It was noted also that J. C. Brickell and
J. C. Jordan, men who had been foremost
in the development of that section of San
Francisco, attended the club meeting
Friday night to hear the subject in hand
properly considered. They were in sym
pathy with the objects of the meeting,
and although members of the Richmond
Improvement Association did not often
attend the pub ie meetings of the club.
Yesterday E. P. E. Troy caused, the ar
rest of Thomas Kerr, foreman of the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery, on the charge of dis
turbing a public meeting. Men who ob
served Kerr's conduct said he should
have been thrown out of the ball by the
police officer. Kerr is said to be a man of
good character and sound sense, and the
opinion is expressed in Richmond that he
would not have shouted 'Amen" and
pounded the floor with his cane if he had
not been prompted to make a scene.
Some regret i- expressed in the south
ern purl of the district that Mr. H_verty
of the Laurel Hill Cemetery was arrested.
A lady at Wolfe's drugstore, in Rich
mond, commenting on the incident last
night, said: "It is hard to fancy Mr. Hav
crty as a disturber of the peace. He ls
such a nice, quiet little man who has
lived with his family of children and
grandchildren over on Johnson avenue
for the last two years. I should never
suspect him of disturbing anybody, be
cause he is mildness and gentility per
sonified."
Haverty was arrested by Officer Hogan
last Friday night. Hogan was a new man
on the beat, and did not know the dis
turbers by name. The scenes of tumult
took him by surprise and he hardly knew
what to do. Had Officer Mulcahy, whose
regular beat is there, and who was on
duty last night, been there on Friday
evening more arrests would have been
mane.
Mulcahy knows everybody in Richmond,
St. Brendan's, and Its Popular
Pastor.
â¢Oa Tuesday next, as announced in yester
day's Call, 81 -v. Father Nugent, the popular
pastor of St. Brendan's Church, will celebrate
his silver jubilee, or, rather, : his friends will
celebrate it in his honor. The greatest en
thusiasm prevails throughout the parish and
among all who know Rev. Father: Nugent to
insure the success of the eclebra ion. ! By his
arduous labors he has built up for himself a
citadel of love and respect ia tiie districts
to which he has devoted himse if. Particulars
of the coming celebration, .which include 1
solemn services at which eminent clergy.will
assist, were published in The Call of yes
terday. . ;

The second day's shooting of the State

of the Olympic Gun Club, came off yester
day according to the programme, and It
was marked by some remarkable work.
The attendance was fairly large. The
.principal event, the second on the list,
was the contest for the Gold Dust trophy,
which was won by James Rice of Visalia.
It was a twenty-bird race. Rice shot in
. good form and killed his twenty sttaight.
; He had a close rival in Otto Feudner, who
also brought his twenty down in good
shape. The two high guns shot off on
j five birds, and again they made another
straight score. Another five birds were
! trapped, and once more the man from Vi
: salia killed all of his clean. Feudner was
, so unlucky as to lose the first, but he
\ killed the remaining four; so the prize
, went to Rice. I *
The fortunate man will hold the medal
until the next tournament, when he will
return it for future competition, but he
will take all the entrance money in the
next match in which the medal is con
tested for, which may amount to a con
siderable sum. Feudner, however, drew
the second prize, $15, and the third, $10,

Pursued fay the Czar Nicholas.
â ;
From the time when Thaddeus Kos- |
ciusko fought for the independence of j
the United Slates as aid-de-camp and j
orderly officer to Washington, his services I
being cora men* ora:el by m.ans of a
monument on the banks of the Hudson
at West Point, and by the Kosciusko |
School for colored people, which Presi
dent Thomas Jefferson founded at New
ark, the people of this country have
always manifested a very marked interest I
in the fate of Poland. All oppressed and
down-trodden nations struggling for free
dom meet with generous and whole-hearted j
sympathy on this side of the Atlantic, no
matter whether they he Armenians, Cre
tans, Irish or Jews. But somehow or an
other the case of Poland appealed more
strongly than that of any of, the unhappy
people jii't mentioned, to the American
heart. Their fight for liberty, which has
continue 1 almost without interruption for
more than 100 years, has been signalized
by so many romantic episodes, baa fur
nished such unique examples of bravery, of
patriotism and of chivalrous self-sacrifice,
that anything which affects their we fare
meets with a keener appreciation in North
America than anywhere else in the world.
This being the case, attention should be
drawn to a v ry remarkable feature of the
new policy of conciliation, which young
Emperor Nicholas from the very moment
of is accession to the throne of Russia
has inaugurated in the Polish . provinces
of his dominions. It is nothing more nor
les than the repeal of that iniqnitous law
which prohibited every one professing
any other than the orthodox Greek
faith from owning or occupying land in
the former kingdom of Poland. Inasmuch
as the Poles, in spite of the cruel persecu
tions to which they have been subjected
on religious as well as on racial grounds,
have remained fervent adherents of the
Roman Catholic church, this was equiva
lent to debarring them from re
taining possession of such of their
ancestral estates as had been left to them
after the wholesale confiscation which the
Russian Government was in the habit of
decreeing alter every revolutionary move
ment, and even without any such cause,
but on the most frivolous and trivial of
pretexts. It is worthy of note that in
spite of the reputation for tyranny en
joyed by the first Emperor Nicholas, and
the renown for the possession of more en
lightened and liberal principles accorded
by history, to his son, the ill-fated Alex
ander 11, tbi3 law was enforced with far
greater severity under the reign of the lat
ter than during that of his parent. In
deed, there is no ruler of Russia beneath
whose rule the Poles may be said to have
suffered so much from persecution and op
pression of evary conceivab c character as
that of the so-called "Liberator" Czar.
The present Emperor has altered all
this and has caused it to be made known
that not only has the obnoxious law in
connection with the tenure of land in the
western provinces been repealed, but,
moreover, that he would be glad to see the
Polish nobility oncd again occupying
their ancestral estates. Ever since this
has. been understood abroad there has
been a steady flow eastward of the Polish
aristocracy, and they are,rapidly.recover
ing, 1 by means of purchase, all those
castles and domains with which the names
of their families have been identified
since time immemorial. Among those who
hava already taken advantage of the
Czar's new policy in this particular are
the Counts Potoeki, Zamoyski, S.arzenski,
Czartoriski, and about 100 more bear
ers of equally illustrious names, who
will doubtless become In course of time
quite as loyal to the Czar as their fellow
countrymen in the Austrian portion of
Poland are to Emperor Francis Joseph.
It is pleasant under the circumstances to
be able to state that these Polish Prin
cesses and Counts, are recovering their
estates at a relatively small cost. The old
proverb, according to which violence and
persecution always end by inflicting more
injury upon the people "Who make use
thereof as an instrument than to those
against whom it was directed, has proved
true once more in this ' instance. For
while the Russian nobles who obtained the
Polish castles and estates either by grant
from the Russian Government, which had
confiscated them, or else merely at a nom
inal price at the compulsory sales are now
in such a state of financial distress and
bankruptcy that Nicholas has ju-t been
forced to appoint an imperial commission
to devise some means for- their relief, the
Polish nobility have prospered to such a
degree in exile that ere long they will
constitute what is to every mouarchial
country a source of boundless strength,
namely, a rich and affluent territorial
aristocracy, possessed of sufficient means
to develop the latent resources of the
country, and above all to ameliorate the
condition of the peasantry and masses for
whoso material welfare as their tenants
they are morally responsible.
Had the until now brief reign of Nicho
las II been signalized by no other event
than the inauguration of this new and lib
eral policy toward the Poles It would in -it-"
â elf have been sufficient to render it notable
in the history of Russia. The present Czar
and his advisers have at length realized
what has long been apparent to every un
prejudiced student of statecraft, namely,
that whereas an antagonistic Poland must
necessarily be a cruel source of weakness
and of acute danger to Russia, a loyal and
contented Poland on the other hand con-'
stitutes a bulwark of defense to the huge
empire against its most / execrated
and hereditary, as well as dreaded
foe, namely, Germany. Poland can
never be Russianized. ,' The national
sentiment, the ......national'., religion
and the love for the national traditions are
too deeply inrooted in the hearts ol the people
for that, and' all attempts lv that direction
have lamentably Jailed, the oniy result hav
ing been to stilt further accentuate the differ
ence between the two races by reducing the
Poles to the condition of political pariahs,
that is to say; a caste apart, deprived of the
civic rights and privileges of the Russian
born subjects of the . Czar, j But while Poland
cannot be Russianized It can be transformed
into an invaluable ally; and if any doubt pre
vailed in the mind of the present Czar It must
have been set at rest by the phenomenal suc
cess which "has attended the policy tin .his
direction pursued in Austrian Poland by
Emperor Francis Joseph. . - .. -
Austria's tactics toward her Polish provinces
have been entire. different to those of Russia
and of Prussia. Whereas the two latter have
endeavored to crush the national sentiment,
the 1 Viennese ) authorities, ;on the . contrary,
have fostered it, and Francis Joseph has made
a point of conceding as much autonomy as he
possibly could toward his Polish lieges. The
result is that to-day there are no more devoted
adherents, no more chivalrously" loyal 'sup-'
porters .of the Hapsburg dynasty v than the
Polish aristocracy and the peasantry of; Gall-'
cla. Tney hail Francis Joseph,' not as their!
"Emperor," but as their ''King,", and are now
engaged in raising, by popular subscription, a
___________
national fund to _Â» used in the restoration of
the former glories of the palace of the old
Polish kings on : the Mount Wavel at
Krakow, which is to be presented lo Francis
Joseph on the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary
of his ascension to the throne. The Galician
peasantry make magnificent; cavalry soldiers
and the Polish nobility the most dashing anu
brilliant cavalry officers. Moreover, the Polish
aristocracy possess so much intuitive shrewd
ness and innate diplomacy that from their
ranks have been recruited many of the most
responsible and valuable servants of the Aus
tro-Hungarian crown. Thus the Prime Minis-,
ter of Austria at the present moment is a
Polish noble of the name of Count Badeui,
while Emperor Francis Joseph, on the occa
sion of his recent state visit to the court of St.
Petersburg, was accompanied by another great
dignitary of Polish nationality, Count Golou-
Chowski, popularly known as "Golou," and
who fills the office of Minister of Foreign
Affairs for the dual empire, and performs Tike
wise the duties of Minister and Chacncellor
of what is known as tha ''Imperial House. of
Austria. ' '~1~. --s~- - "?.' '/*"'. " Â-."-;
Without recommending the Czar to Intrust
the destinies of Russia to Pilish nobles, as
has been done in the case of Austria by the
Emperor Francis Joseph, who has never made
the mistake of attempting to Aus'rianiz* his
Polish subjects, there is no reason whatsoever
why Nicholas should not, if he continues in
his present enlightened course of policy, con
vert the Poles in his dominions into just as
loyal and as devoted vassals and supporters of
his throne as ere the Galiclans in connection
with the crown of Austria-Hungary. And I
may add that no happier time could have been
chosen for the inauguration of a new policy of
this kind in Russian Poland, for it coincides
with a renewal of Emperor William's singu
larly ill-advised endeavors to Prussianize
Posen â that is to say, that portion of the
lormor kingdom of Poland, which at the time
of the partition of the. latter in the last cen
tury was awarded 10 Prussia. People in the
past have been so much accustomed to look
for despotism and tyranny on the part of
Russia that nobody has paid much attention
to Prussia's persecution of her Polish subjects.
True, there have been times when the perse
cution has abated for a period. But the rea
sons for this have been of a nature to reflect
no credit on the authorities at Berlin, for it
has been invariably due not to any sense of
justice nor to any lerations of statecraft
but merely in consequence of the influence
exercised at court by some Poliih noblewoman
possessed of the beauty and captivating charms
of her race. As long as Bismarck remained at
the head of affairs this served to Intensify his
hatred of the Poles, and the latter, looking
upon him as one of the bitterest foes
of their race, naturally took conspicuous part
in, every court cabal against him, for wnich
It Is true be lost no opportunity of revenging
himself. When the old Emperor died and the
influence which the princely house of Radzl
will had exercised upon htm came to an end,
Bismarck had a free hand and oppressed the
Poles, nobles as well as peasants, to his heart's
content. This continued until; his disgrace.
Shortly afterward the young Emperor becamo
subjugated by tho grace and beauty
of huroness Kosciol Kosclelski, wife of
one ot the leaders of the Polish
party in the Prussian House of Lords, and
perhaps the most popular among his country
men of all their national poets and play
wrights. The mastery which the Baroness ob
tained over the young Emperor was so great
that it led to his Â§ Majesty's reversal of the
Blsmarcti an polity toward tho Poles, where
upon the ex-Chancellor, in tbe course of a
public speech, declared that "the Polish influ
ence augments to the, detriment of Prussia al
ways In the measure that some Polish family
obtains mora- or less influence at. court. -I
need not mention that of the Radziwills, and
to-day we have exactly the same state of af
fairs." Bismarck's allusion to the Radziwilis
was a reference to the old Emperor's "grande
passion" for that lovely Princess Elizabeth
Radziwi.l, whom he .was at one moment on
the point of marrying, and to whom he re
mained devoted throughout her lifetime. â¢
This, however, did not stay young Emperor
William. On the contrary, tt served merely
to cause him to show more and more favor to
the Kosciols, and he not only re-established in
deference to their entreaties the Polish lan
guage in the schools and churches of Posen
and nominated a Polish ecclesiastic to the
archbishopric of that province, but likerrise
appointed a number of Polish nobles to im
portant offices at court and in the army. -
All things come to an end, even tho reign of
a beautiful and clever woman. If court gos
sip at Berlin is to be believed both the Em
press Victoria Augusta and her mother-in-law,
Empress Frederick, showed themselves
aggrieved by the amount of talk created both
at home and abroad through the attentions
of the Kaiser to the fair Pole. Moreover, dur
ing the grand army maneuvers that took place
in the province of Posen some of the Polish
nobles in whose castles Bavarian, baxon and
other princes of the Confederation known as
the German empire had been quartered were
emboldened by what they looked upon as
the Emperor's favor toward their race to
adopt a spirit of independence which took the
form in several cases of a refusal to hoist the
flag of their royal guests on the ground that
no colors could ybe permitted to fly except
those of Poland. The climax, however, came
when Baron Kosclol-Kosciolskl, on meeting
the Austrian Emperor at the opening of the
exhibition at L.mberg, in Austrian Poland,
hailed not Emperor.William but his Austrian
Majesty as the real and only "King of Poland,"
the "only King" to whom alone all Poles were
willing to accord allegiance. This speech was
immediately communicated to Emperor .Wil
liam, and as it happened to reach his ears
simultaneously with angry protests from the
King of Saxony, who complained of ihe slights
to which his brother. Prince George, had been
subjected as above described by the Polish no
blemen in whose castles he nad been quar
tered during; the army maneuvers, he deter
mined in his usual impulsive fashion to cut
aurift from influences that had become a mat
ter of public gossip and popular ill will. So he
Intimated to the Baron and Baroness that
their absence ; from court was preferrea to
their presence, and when the Barou traveled
to Potsdam to try to explain matters the
Emperor sternly refused to receive him and
suggested in a manner that allowed no misun
derstanding that the Barou should leave the
city at once and remain on his estates. â  ''.- â ; ~~\', Tl
That ended Polish influence at the court of
Berlin, and as 'if to atoue for his infatuation,
which while it lasted served to estrange many
of his Prussian nobles and his South German
allies, William; is now manifesting as much
bitterness and ill will toward the Poles as he
formerly showed favor. He has as far as pos
sible removed all the Polish nobles from the
positions of dignity aud trust to which he had
appointed them while subject to the thralldom
of the Baroness,' and loies. no opportunity of
saying harsh things about the Poiesin general,
denouncing them as ungrateful and. disloyal,
threatening them with the fullest measure of
his wrath in the event of his discoveung them
engaged in any practices that can possibly be
construed as treasonable. Naturally his sub
ordinates take their cue from him, and the re
sult is that at no momeut hay.; there been so
many instances of persecution, oppression
and downright brutality on â¢ the part of the
Prussian authorities toward the Poles as have
been recorded of late. â¢â¢
Of course, mis only serves to accentuate the
conciliatory ; course pursued' by the Czar on
the eastern shores of the Vistula, and one of
the effects thereof has been , to 5 lead many!
great landed proprietors In Prussian Poland
to migrate acros* the frontier and to transfer

SAN DIEGO SMUGGLERS.
Captain Wright cf the Niraid Believed to
Hare Had Business Men as Con-
federates.
SAN DIEGO, Cal, May 22.â Captain
James D. Wright and Peter Asmuss*n,
who were arrested yestetday afternoon,
charged with smuggling Chinamen into
the United States, are still in jail, unable
to secure bail. i;
Asmussen was called np in United
States Commissioner Knole's court to-day
to tell what he knew of the affair. He
stated that about three months ago he
entered the employ of Wright to go with
him on a cruise down the Mexican coast
after abalone shells and meat. They put
in at Santa Tomes with the schooner
Nereid, which Wright had leased from
Joseph Sexton of this city. Leaving the
sailor in charge of the vessel Wright went
inland, returning the next day with eight
Chinamen whom he transferred to the
schooner.
After taking on a cargo of shells the
Nereid sailed northward, putting in on
May 5 at Mussel Cove, fifty-five miles
north of this city. , There they landed the
Chinamen and returned to this port, dis
charged their cargo and sailed southward
again.
â â¢: Upon arriving at Santa Tomas Wright
need as though he expected some one,
but there was evidently a hitch,, for he
told Asmussen to return, alone with the
schooner to San Diego. This the latter
did. Upon his arrival he went straight to
Virgilio Bruschi, a well-known Italian
merchant, who, Asmussen claims, knew
all about the Mussel Cove incident, and
asked him if the coast were clear for
Wright to return to the city. Bruschi
said everything was all right, and Asmus
sen sailed southward. He returned yes
terday with Wright, and upon their ar
rival both were, arrested by the customs
officers. The schooner/which is valued at
$000 and belongs to Jose H. Sexton, was
seized, and to-day a Chinese merchant,
See Chung, was arrested as an accomplice
of Wright, and released on $300 bail. -
Bruschi denies . all complicity in the
affair and claims he was simply provision
ing the schooner for legitimate trade. He
has not yet been arrested, but warrants
are out for the cap'ains of two other little
trading schooners which are believed to be
engaged in smuggling. Upon their ar
rival here they will be seized.
Collector Fisher says he has informa
tion from a rancher named Smith, near
Oceanside, that a large quantity of opium
was smuggled ashore near there Wednes
day night. The rancher discovered the
smugglers, who were eight in number, and
who threatened his life if he "poached"
on them. \ It is thought that all of these
belong to a large gang that has been oper
ating on this coast for two years past and
which has preventatives among business
men of this city. y-f^ -

STOCKTON, Cal, May There is a
prospect that a line of steamers will be
run between Stockton and Oakland by the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company. Manager Corcoran said this
morning that the Mary Garratt was to be
put on the run and would leave here three
times a week for Oakland. If the mer
chants of that city and the traveling pub
lic there give sufficient encouragement
the steamer will ba kept "on right along.
It is not settled yet where the landing
place in Oakland will be. According to
Corcoran, several enterprising citizens of
Oakland had made offers of laud for
wharf room.

other terms, once as familiar, and almost
as commonly used, but now put away on
the same sbe f witn the goose egg, are the
'red-hot grounder' and the 'daisy-cutter.'
"The daisies grow now just as" thoy did
then (for which let us be duly grateful),
but the baseball is a daisy cutter no
longer. Tne balls are heated now as red
hot as everâ if anything,; a little hotter,
but such a ball is no longer described as in
the .phrase once familiar, as a 'red-hot
grounder.' The/extreme warmth of the
sphere is now referred to in some other
manner.' ';:

Their Vagaries About Dur
rant Disturb Not the
Chief.
MRS. M. SCHWARTZLER'S
STORY BLIGHTED.
It Is Given Its Quietus by Miss
Elsie Baker, a Hair
dresser.
THE RECORD OF BRYANT AS A
PREVARICATOR
As to Mrs. Thresher, Why She Is
. Simply Belisved to Be of
Unsound Mind.
Every day brings forth some new de
velopment exposing the "fake" story of
Mrs. Schwartzler in regard to Minnie
"Williams and Rev. Dr. Gibson being on
the ferry-boat together.
One of Mrs. Schwartzler's statements to
Chief Lees was that her first husband,
Jack Winters, was an engineer on the
Southern Pacific and was accidentally
killed in a collision near Los Angeles.
That was why she r-ecan.a acquainted
with Marshal George E. Gard.
Yesterday Chief L-es received a dis
patch from Marshal Gard as follows:
In November, 1595, 1 called three times on
Mrs. Schwartzler, at her home on Sixth street,
ebout Mrs. Lena Marshall, who was shot at
Baden station. Mrs. .Schwartz was then a
widow. I never saw her husband. I proved
her statement about Lena to be false and be
came satisfied she was courting notoriety.
She told me she was on the boat the day
Minnie Williams came over to see Durrani,
but said nothing about any one being with
her. She said that while selling her medicines
and nursing at Alameda she became ac
quainted with her by sight. 1 I never reported
it to you because I didn't believe her state
ment!
Chief Lees detailed Detective Ross Whit
aker to find out if Jack Winters, Mrs.
Schwartzler 7 - first husband, was ever em
ployed by the Southern Pacific. The rec
ord- of tbe company, which are very
thorough and complete, were carefully ex
amine- from the construction of the road
to the present time and no such , man as
Jack Winters was ever in the employment
of the company in any capacity.
Detective Gibson was detailed yesterday
by Chief Lees to interview Frank
Schartzler, the woman's husband. He is
employed in a butcher-shop "owned by
Mr. Roberts, on California street, near De
visadero. ; â Â£.*!"â  v \- :*.'â 
The following interesting conversation
took place between them:
"Are you Mrs. Schwanzler's husband?"
asked Gibson. - '
"I think 1 am," was Schwartzler's re
ply-
"Have yoa any doubt about it?"
"Well, I think I am," repeated
Schwarizler.
"Where were you married?"
"Go and see Mr?. Schwartzler.
"When were you married?"
"None of your business."
Schwartzler finished by tolling Gibson
that if he wanted any information about
the Dur.-ant business to go to Mrs.
Schwartzler and not bother him.
As a further proof of the absurdity of
Mrs. Schwartzler's story, chief Lees yes
terday afternoon procured the following
statement from Miss Elsie B.iker of the
Kamona hair-store, 252 Ellis street: .
I formerly kept my hair-dressing store at
1349 Park sireet, Alameda, in 1895. I knew
Miss Minnie Williams who residtd with- Mr.
and Mrs. Morgan at Versailles avenue, 'Ala
meda. Minnie was a friend of mine, lt was
my custom to dress her hair at times. I knew
her for about one year.
Minnie called at my hairdressing parlor at
Alameda on, Thursday afte noon. April 11,
1895, between the hours ol 3 and 4. She-re
mained about half an hour. Minnie came to
show me tier new waist, the one she was found
murdered in.
Minnie Williams called the next day, April
12, 1895, about 1 p. m. She remained only a
lew minutes. She came to make an engage
ment with me to dress her hair. The hour of
3 p.m. was fixed for that purpose. This was
April 12, 1895.
Minnie arrived at my parlors a little beiore
3P. M, April 12, 1895. When she arrived I
was busy dressing Mrs. V.'s [ hairâ a * lady who
resides in Alameda. I excused myself to Mrs.
V., ss Minnie had a. fixed -appointment at
3P. m. It took me about half an hour to dress
Minnie's hair. She told me before leaving my
xiiop tbat she would have brought me tome
flowers, but she "said she wanted to take the
flowers to the City to decorate the church
with, and also sma, "I think I am late, lam
so sorry, I want to raich the 3:40 train for the
City, as I have an engagement at the Narrow
gauge Ferry, San Francisco."
1 never saw Minnie Williams alive after she
left my hairdressing establishment. Minnie
also said she would go to her home a- Mrs.
Morgan's to get her flowers to go to the City.
Hne then left my store. I then proceeded to
finish Mrs. V.'s nair. When finished Mrs. V.
also left for her home in Alameda, whicn is
on Alameda street.
After I heard of the murder of Minnie Wil
liams I met Mrs. V. and she tola me when she
took the narrow-gauge train that Minnie
came aboard the same train at Park-street
station at 4:10 p. _(Â bound for San Francisco.
Mrs. V. rone on the .train with Minnie as far
as the Morton-street station, where Mr*. V. left
the train to go to her home. Minnie continued
on to San Francisco.
The druggist that keeps the oldest drugstore
at Park-street, station, Alameda, said" that
Minnie Williams requested him to remove a
cork from a bottle of permutes, as she could
not get the cork out herself, uhen Minnie
left his store he saw her take the nurrow-gauge
train going to San Francisco from Park-street
station at 4:10 p.m.
Mrs. Schwartzler, in her statement, said
that she; saw Minnie Williams on the
broad-gauge boat with a man having
scars on his neck who left the boat with
her and boarded a Valencia-street car.
There i* tne testimony of Miss Baker, the
druggist at Park-street Station, Mrs! V.,
whose name is not given by Chief L?es
because she does net want any notoriety,
and Mrs. Elisa Wiltee, the latter of whom
was on the same train and boat with Min
nie and saw her]. joined at the ferry by a
young man, whom -she alterward identi
fied as Durrant, and go ; with her toward a
Howard-street car, that, Minnie* crossed
over on the jaarrow-giiuge boat and no one
was with her. " . . *.'.'.
Then there is the testimony of the
younj; men, Hobc and Duke, and others
who saw Durrant waiting at, the narrow
gauge Jerry for about an hour, and Hobe
saw him joined by a young lady whose
description, as given by him, tallied ex
actly with Minnie Williams.' Minnie
missing the 3:40 train. accounted for Dur
rant waiting around the ferry so long.
| There is also the testimony of Miss An
nie Moisant, 2708 Central avenue, Ala
meda, and Miss Ruth McKean. They were
going* to San Francisco "on 'Thursday,
April 8, 1895, by the 2 p. m. train with a
young man, but missed it. - : Then 1 1 1 <â¢ v

posed that Durrant at.that time made the
engagement with Minnie to meet her Fri
day, April 12, she to leave by the 3:40 p. M.
train. '.:â .â '- _â¢; i - â¢ i
All these facts, in the opinion of Chief
Lees, form ' a complete chain and show
conclusively the utter absurdity of jj Mrs.
Schwartzler's story.' ~ . * '7'
The police, in disposing of Mrs.
Schwanzler's weird story, -significantly
call attention to the fact that' when Lena
Marten, the station aeent at Baden, told
the weird story two years ago about being
robbed by highwaymen she depended
upon this same Mrs. tchwartzler to bol
ster up the yarn. The officer- say that
the latter's story was easily proven to be
a fake.- .-'â '* "tr;

The complete record of William G. Bry
ant, the decrepit ex-soldier who - recently
contracted the latest epidemic and con
fessed that he was the Bartlett-street
butcher, is now in the bands of the
local police, and it proves what the Chief
first announced that the man is off
his mental balance and has a special
mania for telling "whoppers," and, prob
ably believing them himself. He has been
traced back as far as 1864, when he joined
the California Volunteers at Sacramento.
He deserted, but was afterward reinstated.
Then he went through a checkered career
all over the country under different names
and repeatedly got into petty scrapes on ac

AT EMERYVILLE
Fabiola Day a Grand Sue- 1
cess Financially and
Otherwise.
Wheel of Fortune Was in Rare
Form, Equaling a Coast
Record.
Reversals of Form Were Somewhat
Numerousâ Mollie R. Won at
Stimulating Odds.
With an infield dotted with gayly
decorated equipages of all sorts and de
scriptions loaded with nretty women, the
cream and culture of Oakland society, all
resplendent in pretty summer suitings
and dazzling colors and a nearly filled
grand stand, '-Fabiola day" at Emeryville
track was a pronounced success. The
society ladies may not have understood
the many intricacies of the game, such as
playing a horse to show, nor the strict in
terpretation of the word "lobster" as mis
cellaneously used around tracks, but they
seemed to enjoy the close finishes and the
tfforts of the jockeys immensely. The
more staid countenances of the regulars
gazed on these pyrotechnical displays at
the end of each race with a hardened look,
gradually taken on through many seasons
vi buffeting and innumerable reverses on
the grand circuit.
Pretty Miss Lucrezia Borgia, the newly
elected holder of the world's four-mile
record, was paraded before the stand, with
mane and tail entwined with gaudy rib
bans, just previous to the calling out of
(the horses for the Fabiola derby and
seemed to drink in with much delight the
applause so heartily bestowed by the ad
miring throng.
The racing, ior a last day, was quite
invigorating, nearly if not ail of the start
ers evidently being meant, even though
disastrous for the choices, as but two
favored ones in the ring got to the wire in
advance of their company.
The so-termed "Faoiola derby" was the
best contested raceÂ»of the afternoon, and
the instance, one and a quarter miles, was
covered by the winner, Wheel oi Fortune,
in coast record â 2:06^. The track
was lightning fast, which, in a meas
ure, accounted for the fast time hung out.
The Roman was post favorite at odds of 9
to 5, and but for the gayety of Stevens
toward the end should have won. Taranto,
with J. Ward and 81 pounds in the sad
dle, skated out in iront, and for a while
it looked as though Bergen's horse would
not drop back. In the stretch ne faltered
a trifle, and the Roman, closing on . him,
looked to have the race in hand. Then it
was that Stevens grew cay, and Piggott,
on the second choice. Wheel of Fortune,
observing the' fact, plied whip and spur
and snatched the race irom the coal** by
the shortest of heads in record time. Pig
gott gained some well-earned applause.
Anabasis, the 8 to 5 choice, took the
opening six-furlong selling purse from a
lieid of fourteen. Freeman had the j
I mount and, gradually moving up from
sixth position, downed Little Sister, a 12
ti 1 shot, -Which had made all ihe run

cripple Mulberry was a close third under j
Clawson's pilotage. ' , '< *

Ximt,l;ls-
yesterday at odds of 8 and 9 to 1 over
hauled Coda in the stretch and won
easily from Naglee Burkes mare in 1:48%.
Walter J, the 2to 1 favorite, got a miser
able ride under the pilotage of ' Stevens.
Del Paso, the second choice, was third.
: After running as a sleeper on her last
two public appearances, Pete Mitchell
finally told the boy to give Rose Clark
head, and she beat a good field in the
third event, a six-furlong spin, at odds of
15 to 1. Mainstay, the 2 to 1 choice, rid
den by Shaw, was in front to the stretch,
where he besran tiring under bis 129
pounds of weight. Midas, third choice,
was or* a ten by a length by the winner.
Mollie R kept up the acrobatic record.
Favorite last time' out she failed to land
inside the coin, and the ring took great
liberties with her during the betting on
the eleven starters in the 'mile selling
dash. Fortunate, currying By Holly's
colors, was an 8 to 5 favorite, and cut out
the running until the paddocs was
reached, . when she was overhauled and
easily defeated by Moiiie R, on which lit
tle Holmes rode a splendidly judged race
in the fast time of 1:41 H. Brown got
Thelma home in the show. ,;
Strange to relate Montallade, the 2 to 1
favorite, carried off the tin ai race on the
card. Holly's useiul geldin.' was held "at
odds of 2 to 1 throughout the belting and,
assuming first place when squared away
for the final effort, led Sallie Cliquot out
by three lengths in 1:15 flat. Road warmer
who cut out the pace, was third, barely
nosed out for second money.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 23, 1897.
"HOW ABOUT
CLEVELAND?"
Judge Maguire's Reception
Turned Into a Ques
tion Bee.
High Tribute Paid to Republican
Congressmen Evokes
Applause.
Mayor Phelan and J H. Barry Talk.
Monopolies, Arago Cass and
, N w Postolfice.
Last night was a great time for the local ;
Democratic and People's parties. The
scene of their rejoicing was Metropolitan
Temple and the occasion a reception to
Congressman. James G. Maguire under
the auspices of the two -parties in ques
tion and the Iroquois Club. It turned
out a regular love least.
The large hall was filled with an enthu
siastic audience, which voiced its ap
proval without stint of everything that
was said and done. The speakers' stand
was gayly decorated .with American flags
and bunting, and there sat many promi
nent members of the Iroquois Club and
the People's party, Mayor Phelan, James
H. Barry and others. The affair was
further enhanced in the popular eye by
the presence of a brass band.
The first speaker was William Craig,
who paid a tribute to the two parties rep
resented and to Judge Maguire as the
"champion of the people." After read
ing a letter from Governor Budd, by his
private secretary, stating that he was un
avoidably detained but testifying to his
high - appreciation of Maguire's person
ality and labors for the State, Craig intro
duced Dr. G. W. Day wait as the chairman'
of the meeting.
Dr. Day wait made an eloquent and
graceful speech of introduction, leading
up from party principle*) generally- to the
most popular representatives of those
canons, and finally to Maguiro as the
"Ajax whose mighty blows Had so discon
certed the enemy."
"It has been said by one of old," he
began, "that conflict breeds intelligence.
Within the last few years and during the
last campaign, the conflict has become so
bitter that the lines are sharply drawn. â¢
"An attempt has been made to en
throne gold as a god and to dethrone the
goddess silver. For a time it has suc
ceeded, but the day is soon coming when
another song will be sung.
"Among all those who have battled in
th* cause of liberty and the common peo
ple there is none more conspicuous than
the one who will addres- us to-night. He
it is whose name is famous the country
over as the man who defeated the in
famous funding bill. You will now have
the pleasure of listening to tbat Uero of
the Republic that man who has never
been found wanting in the cause of the
â¢peopleâ the Hon. James G. McGuire." ; '--.'.
As Judge Maguire arose from bis seat
and stepped to the front of the rostrum
he was lustily cheered. As soon as quiet
reigned he launched forth upon the rhe
torical sea without more ado. . t
"I thank you for this splendid demon
stration of your approval of my conduct,"
be said. "1 know of nothing that could
be more grateful to the heart of one who
has tried to ao bs duty in all things. I
thank you, one and all, my constituent-,
and you, gentlemen, who passed such
encomiums upon my public conduct in
your remarks of introduction.
"I believe I can truthfully say that
what I have promised before election I
have to the best of my ability tried to
fulfill after election. ' Believing with
Daniel Webster that eternal justice is to
be striven alter in all things and that
â¢eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, 'T
have never permitted expediency or any
thing else to frustrate my impulse to drive
a nail in behalf of liberty whenever the
opportunity presented itself.
"There are in this-' land to-day great
monopolies that have attained such mag
nitude that they are attempting to govern
the Government instead of being governed
by it. I have seen the old Democracy
come to ibe front rejuvenated and make a
fight for those natural; legal rights which
God ordained should exist among men. I
have seen' the new Democracy rise from
the loins of the old Democracy and strike
for freedom in this Republic; and with it
I have seen another giant 01 the people's
rights, the People's party, and a small
part of the Republican party, join hands
in the fight, and they will go up against
the enemy in ihe next battle, and their
triumph is morally certain." .
At this juncture a gruff voice from the
gallery inquired, "riow about Grover
Cleveland, the stuffed prophet?" v\
"1 beg your pardon," replied the
speaker. "lam talking of the Demo
cratic party and not of Grover Cleveland.
The best' tning I can do in 1 the case of
Grover Cleveland is to maintain a respect
ful silence. lam sure if I said anything
of him' it could not be mure respectful
than that.V^ogn|9^P_l_^>''
Amid the laughter and cheer, of the
audience Congressman Maguire proceeded
to review in detail the scenes and inci
dents of thelaÂ»t campaign and the results.
The name of William J. Bryan was heart
ily cheered, and also the speaker's state
ment that protection had not yet brought
prosperity. In fact, a large part of the
oration consisted of a tossing of verbal
bouquets at Bryan as the representative
nt the united forces of the Democracy and
Populism and at the latter element for
their so-called foresight in fusing. .
The various monopolies Were, taken hp
in turn and rapped on every vulnerable
point The coal, the Standard Oil and the
railroad monopoly were considered espe
cially, and the laws which permitted them
to exist recommended:. repealed. The
speaker would not repeal all such laws, as
their repeal might affect the Government
injuriously in other places.
"But I want to say," he asserted, when
neai ing his conclusion, "that in the fight
against tbe Pacific railroad notbing'could
have been done 7by me without "the loyal
support of Senators White and Perkins
and my Republican colleagues, Barharo,
Hilborn and Bowers. - They deserve all
praise and honor for their noble work."
The Arago case was treated in detail,
and the hope was expressed that before
the expiration of another term of Con
gress "this foul blot-will; be .wiped from
the statute * books. This case â¢ has '. been
fought for four years and is being argued
before the Supreme Court by Judge Ma*
quire now. ' â "" :--~'* 1 :?
In answer to a question how about Cuba
he stated .that for the last few days she
has been well cared for by, the Senate. , ':
One of the last subjects treated was that
of the construction of the new Postoffice.
The work done for it was revi-wed in de
tail. : The speaker saw no reason why the
work should be longer delayed. ;: '-
The speaker here closed: with' a compli
ment to Mayor j Phelan, who was intro
duced by Chairman Day wait and made
a speech eulogistic of MajMiire's record.
. _ Loud calls lor James H. Barry followed,'
and he in turn referred tot the records of
the two former speakers and -poke on the
same . general i lines. He ' being ":â â  the - last
speaker t his ; record j was * the 'only * one of
the speakers not exploited. The meeting
closed with three cheers for Maguire as
the .'.'next Governor of .California.' - -.-.--

ceived a liberal common school education
in his boyhood days and occupied a lucra

gins on wheat and the routine of business
life. Nothing would satisfy him short of
a university education, with a view to

As he was then in the twenties, bis
friends discouraged him, but undismayed,
he shipped to Oxford, England, applied

At the end of seven years of diligent ap

When this Beit has been on the body one hour it places enough vital power in
the nerves to supply ail that would be exhausted by an ordinary person in a whole
day. It is worn from 4to 8 hours /day or night ;. hence it keeps the body con-
stantly saturated with eight times as much vitality as is needed to carry on the work
of running the human machinery. : All this excess goss to build up the reserve force
which has been weakened by some means in the past. : ; Any one who understands

PHOENIX CLUB.
County Clerk Carry Presented With- a
Beautiful Gold Badge.
A special meeting of the Phoenix Ue-"
puDlican Club was held last night to make
final preparations for the club picnic to
San Jose to-day. "~
After the meeting the executive com
mittee of the club met, and County Clerk
Charles F. Curry was called in. .'.-'-
The president of the club, in a few well
chosen words, in which he spoke of Mr.
Curry's warm interest in the club,* of
which he was the originator, and his
equally warm interest in the Republican
party generally and for its unity, pre
sented him with a solid gold badge as a
memento of the kindly . feelings enter
tained for him by the members of the
club. The president concluded by pin
ning the badge on Mr. Curry's breast.
Ex-Senators Thomas Maher and Pal
nt leri followed with a few well-timed re
marks and Mr. Curry briefly returned
bis thanks, saying he wouid treasure the
badge, not for iis intrinsic value, but for
the feelings of personal regard that called
it forth. "â ::. :.\i.
. It was the intention to present the
badge as the picnic to-day, but owing to
the critical condition of Mr. Curry's
brother, William, who is believed to be
dying, and the possibility that Mr. Curry
would not be able to attend the picnic, it
was decided to make the presentation last
night.
Tne badge bears the inscription on the
back, "Presented to Chas. F. Curry by
Phoenix Republican Club, May 23, 1897."
On a crossbar is the name, in blue enam
eled letters, "Chas. F. Curry," and on the
top of the badge, '-Phoenix Republican
Club, 1890-1897." In the center is an en
crusted gold phoenix studded with dia
monds and on the edges gold forget-me
nots. .-.'...
Mr. Curry was the originator of the club j
and has been content io be one of the
rank and hie, although taking the liveliest
interest in its progress. : -; *
Charges Dismissed.
United States Commissioner Heacock yester
day dismissed the charges of uttering coun
terfeit ' money : preferred against Charles
Erhardt and John Matthews. The evidence

know that the 50-cent piece which each of
them passed was counterfeit.
Convicted o Burglary.
Ed McAuliffe was convicted of burglary of
ti.e first degree in Judge .Cook's court yester
day. McAuliffe robbed a gunstore owned by

is the magic word that has of lato taken on a
new meaning to a great many new people who
ride to their homes un the __d-st cats.
Living in one's own homeâ in a hand-tome, well-
appointed and conveniently arranged oneâ that's
v.here pleasure, real pleasure comes In.
This fact has n- ver been more fully appreciated
than in the case of those fortunate people who have
invested in tho-ecozy new homes In the Heyma.i
Traci, paying for them on monthly installments
that are no larger than what they have been pay-
ing out In rents.
Seven new 4 and 5 room houses, worth from
51 .50 to $2500, have just been completed by MR
J.AC'i'B HEYMAN. They are baud.ome, mod-
ern, well arranged and easy of access from ihe
center of the city. Tney are yours for the money
you are now throwing away in rents. This may
seem a most astonishing statement, but it is so
You can have your sen ctiou of any of these 7
houses by paying a monthly rental. At the end
of the time when your payment." have reached
$.2Â£o or $2600, accord. as your selection has
been, the properly is yours. Doesn't that heat
-any rent-paying propo ,1. lon you ever heard of?

PIQUANTE SADIE
HAS NO ANGEL
KtV , â¢ t ts *n
"Excelsior Jr." a Frost,
but the Chill Concerns
Her Not.
Rumors That the Company
Would Disband Denied by
Everybody.
The Piece Is Owned by Berry anl
How â C ptain Starr Is the
Real Back r.
The extravaganza "Excelsior Jr." will
go out to-night, after a two weeks' en
gagement at the Columbia. Financially
the piece has not been a success, notwith
standing the wealth of scenery, gorgeous
costumes and the presence of Miss Mar
tinot and Mr. Cawthorn in the list of
stars. ,
There were stories on the street yester
day that the company had gone to pieces
owing to a sudden attack of chills on an
angel, who, it was said, was backing Miss
Martinot in the enterprise. These re
ports did Miss Martinot an injustice.
"Excelsior Jr." has an angel all good
enough in the person of Captain P. R.
Starr of Vicksbnrs*, Miss., at present com
manding the United States steamship
Meers, but it happens that Miss Martinot
is simply a salaried player.
"It is simply scandalous that anybody
should connect my name with that of
Captain Starr," said Martinot. "I
had concluded my engagement with the
"Gay Parisians" when I was offered a posi
tion by Mr. B?rry, which I accepted, as I
would with any other company.
"There is no 'angel' behind me and I
need none, if the box receipts show poor
appreciation of the piece I have beard
nothing of it. I don't believe the com
pany is going to disbandâ in fact, I never
heard any of the people talking bf such a
thing."
Captain Starr advanced the money to
Matt L. Berry and Junius Howe, whose
names appear as proprietors of the piece.
Miss Martinot joinea the company in
| New Orleans on its way West, and de
clares she never saw Captain Starr but
once in her life.
In all there are some forty people in the
company, and these are unanimous in de
claring that they will stay with the ship,
although sailing i< rather slow just at
present. Manager Berry managed" to ac
complish wonders with the means at his
disposal last night Salaries were paid in
proportion to the funds in the treasury,
; with the promise that arrears would be
I forthcoming within a few days.
The company is billed in Los Angeles
for Tuesday night, but it may be that the
frosty weather experienced here may re
sult in a through jump to Kansas City.
A number of chorus-girls, who were en
gaged only for the season here, will de
dropped this evening. From there the
company will go to Chicago for a four
weeks' engagement. Junius Howe left
for that city last Wednesday.

ON A STRANGER
How George Sullivan Knew
That His House Had
Been Robb.d.
The Thief Was Evidently Starl
ing on His Regular Summer
Programme.
o_ce Robb'd a House and Left a Note
M're Humorous Than Ac

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
'JO- Broadway, May 22. )
George Sullivan, who resides at the
Amies residence on the San Lorenzo
road, got a big Surprise Friday evening
which resulted in the smart capture of a
clever burglar. He was driving from the
depot to his home when he saw a young
man coming along the road wearing his
(Sullivan's* new summer overcoat.
Sullivan could not arrest the man or
swear to his coat merely by having seen
it, so he drove home, and on arriving at
the Armes residence he discovered that
the bureau drawers and trunks had been
sorted out and everything of value that
was portable hnd been taken. Sullivan
bad only been from the house about an
hour and a half and had driven Mrs.
Armes to the depot.. He must have been
watched by the uurglar, who entered the
house as soon as the party bad left.
Sullivan drove into town, enlisted the
services of Constable Gallet, and the two
started out to find the burglar. They
drove many miles on different roads and
questioned many people, but could not
hnd the young gentleman wearing Mr.
Sullivan's overcoat. They started toward
Oakland, when they met a tramp who
told them he had seen a neatly dressed
stranger with a light overcoat about half
a mile along the load.
Gallet and Sullivan drove along speed
ily and the latter soon saw a figure ahead
of him wearing his summer overcoat.
The stranger was much astonished when
told that he was under arrest, and as soon
as the overcoat was thrown open it was
seen that he Lad also appropriated Mr.
Sullivan's best suit.
A search of his rockets brought to light
two watches, an opera-glass, several ring*,
some studs, a case of razor-", a jewel-case
and several other things of value, all of
which had been in the Armes residence a
short time before.
The man was taken into town and locked
up. He nave the name first of Smith and
then of Jensen, and will nave a prelimi
nary examination on Monday.
The ycun_ fellow answers the descrip
tion of a man who was very badly wanted
last summer. He made a living by going
into farmhouses, and helping himself
when the residents were out.
On one occasion he managed to find $60
in a ranch-bouse near Decoto at a time
wh.n the rancher and his wife were at
tending a prayer-meeting in the church a
mile away. At this time he laid a table,
helped himseif to everything that was
good in tne larder, and left a note of
thanks, in which >>c stated that with tb**
aid of the money he had found ho would
vine next-day at- tno-p_iace;Hotel: "A"
cood description of the man was obtained
by those who saw him, but he was not
heard of again, but now it is believed he
was starting out on the same kind of a
summer cruise.
MAY BE NO REGISTER.
There Will Probably Be No
Annual Catalogue for the
tate University.
De-ay in Its Publication Dua to th.
C o.ing of the State Printing
Oi'fic v
BERKELEY/ Cal., May There is a
. strong probability that the State Univers
ity will be without any register or annual
catalogue this year on account of the clos
ing of the State Printing Office. The copy
for the volume has been ready for publica
tion for some time past and should have
appeared over a month ago, before the
closing of the spring term. The rush of
matter to the State Printer during the last
days of his work has thus far shut out the
register. In consequence, it is probable
that unless the Regents spend money on
printing no register will be issued.
The last catalogue contained 263 octavo
pages and furnished a complete index of
ull the work carried on in the various de
partments of the university, both at
Berkeley and in San Francisco, besides
containing a list of all the professors and
students in the institution. The loss of
the year book for 1897 will mean that all
information lo students and prospective
students in the country concerning- the
university will be cutoff..
The university has a ready suffered to a
considerable extent through the shutting
down of the printing office, the annual
report of the agricultural department, be
sides, many miscellaneous public docu
ments, having been left untouched by the
hand of the printer. .

A very desperate attempt at robbery in
a saloon was made late to-night just out
side the city limits. Two masked men,
armed, went into a saloon at Thirty-eighth
street and San Pablo avenue. There were
five men in the saloon and the robbers
told them to hold -up their hands. The
men did not obey and a scuffle . ensued,
during which one of the robbers fired a
shot.
It did not hit anybody, and as soon as
they could get away the robbers ran out
of the saloon. They went in the direction
of Emeryville.
Constable Hart was soon on the scene
and he at once went in pursuit of the rob
bers, bnt had not captured them by mid
night. The place where the affair oc
curred is just two blocks outside the city

Society Parades in Gay At

Rigs.
Under the Banner of Charity
Doctors of All Beliefs Bur- f
ied the Hatchet.
Incidentally .a Precedent Was Set
That Will B; Useful in the
Future.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â¢-. 90S Broadway, May 22. f
Neither little pills nor big pills cat any
figure in the observance of Fabiola Day.
For a few hours at least warring doctors
buried the hatchet and united in enjoying
themselves and upending a few dollars for
the benefit of Oakland's favorite hospital.
Notwithstanding the fact that for the
Some of the Handsome Turnouts at th; Fabiola Benefit.
past three months allopathic doctors,
homeopathic doctors and eclectics have
been struggling for supremacy at Fabiola,
there was no evidence of it to-aay.
M. D.'s who took a prominent part in
upholding the allopathic . end of the con
troversy went to the racetrack to enjoy
themselves, and as it is not to be believed
that they went in on a pass to a benefit
for what they term is an bomeoDathio insti
tution, it must be conceded ihat there is
one thing known to mankind which can
unite temporarily even disaffected saw
bones in Oakland.
That one thing is charity. > \
The benefit tendered to-day at the race
track to the Fabiola Hospital Association
also possesses another significance. It bas
established a precedent, broadminded
doubtl.s-, and possibly a good one. It is
very evident that dispensers of charity -in
Oakland believe that the means justify the
end. When the racetrack was established
much opposition was shown toward it by
those who wish to protect public morals.
80 strong was this opposition that it was
even necessary for a separate town to be
incorporated for the purpose of legalizing
the racetrack. '. 'â  "
The opposition died away when mer
chants found that the racetrack added
somewhat to the volume of trade, and by
degrees Thomas H. Williams was regarded
as not quite such a" Mephistopbeles as he
was originally, painted; When it became
known that it would be inadvisable to
hold a May day festival this year on be
half of Fabiola because of the Christian
Endeavor and Fourth of July celebrations
which will come in a few weeks, there was
some " consternation ... among the worthy
! ladies who guide the destinies of Fabiola.
Great was their relief, however, when
T.H. Williams offered to give a special
race meeting for the benefit of the institu
tion. . He told the . ladies ; be would give
them the use of the track, would put up
the necessary r purses vto insure * good
events, and would 3 inaugurate a Fabiola
derby which will become an annual event.
* The ladies were cordially and politely in
formed tbat 1 they could carry away wi th
them after the events the total proceeds
of the treasurer's office for the day. His
offer was accepted, and there is no doubt
tnat in the future a special day at the race
track will; be* sought whenever the funds
of charity run low. ;-,.'-. : .

; H. Grass, 11*3/ Park avenue, I and '(â  told a
pitiful tale;; about herself. 'She said that
she was an orphan and lived with an old

with indifferent success as she was but 14

Her tale aroused the pity of Mr. Grass

however, disclosed the fact that â¢so far
from having been turned away trom any
where, she had been an inmate of the
convent at San Leandro, and - bad- rnn
away of her. own accord. - She was re
turned to the convent this morning.

discussion the club has at length decided
to again enter the lists. . The race will be

San Lorenzo Discovers Why
the Town Does Not
Grow.

Business Men Take ths Matter Up

" ~ â ~ '

San Lorenzo is in serious trouble. For
a long time past it has been the desire of
the residents that the principal of their
public school should reside in the town.
Principal Doyal now comes forward with
a *Â«tatemei.t that there is not an available
house in San Lorenzo in which he can re
side.
:â Mr. Doyal has been very unfavorably
criticised because of his relusal to estab
lish himself and family among the pupils
of the school. : The matter has been lain
before lhe trustees and the impression has
gone forth that while Principal Doyai i*
not too independent to draw his salary
from the. little town of San Lorenzo,
he prefers a wider social sphere tnan th
little town at the end of the * electric
branch road can afford. During the past
week the matter has been discussed and
Principal Doyal gave as his reason for not
living in the little town that he bad tried
to get a suitable house lor himself and
family, but could not find one. An inves
tigation showed that the objection of the
principal was not without foundation.
At the present time there is not a vacant
house in the town in- which any one
would ask his school principal to reside.
There are a few tumble-down places with
a "to let" sign in the window, hut not one
in which the principal of a public school
could reside with dignity.
' .This lack of accommodation will shortly
redound to the benefit of the town. It
bas opened the eyes of the people to th*
fact that the town will never grow unless
new hou-es are built occasionally, and a
movement is on foot to stir up men of
wealth who have interests at San Lorenzo
and induce them to make conditions such
that Principal Doyal's reason lor not liv
ing where be earns his salary will no
longer hold good. ;; \.f'-

THE OWNER TO BE ARRESTED
WHEN FOUND.
Manufac. urers' Association Proposes
to Prevent the Exportation
of the S uff
Collector Wise yesterday went to the
rescue of the sheep-dip labeled "California
Brand and procured the arrest of Chief
Food Inspector James P. Docuery for
having interfered with a United States
official in the discbarge of his auty and
for having broken into and destroyed part
of the contents of three packages of "dis
tilled spirits" in transit under United
States bond. 3LJB
Just before Dockery arrived at the rail
road freight yard yesterday morning a
Custom-house truck drove up in charge of
Custom* Inspector Payne, and the three
barrels bored Into by the inspector on the
evening before were loaded on the trucis
and carried away for evidence.
The three cars which contained the
alcoholic dope 'had been moved away to a
switch a hundred yards to the west, and
each car was sealed, with the seal of the
Custom-house.
When Inspector Dockery arrived Cus
toms Inspector Cooly notified him that the
cars were closed and under the seal of the
United States. This was a serious matter,
and Dockery was aware of it, for he made
no attempt to break into the car. He
sent a messenger to the office of the Board
of Health for quarantine papers, his in
tention being to quarantine the "brandy"
as an impure beverage and thus prevent
its exportation.
While waiting for tbe messenger's re
turn Dockery killed time by copying the
numbers and marks on the cars.
Yard master Hardy arrived at about 1
o'clock, and stationed two stalwart rail
way hands at tbe door of each car as
guards. Hardy informed Dockery that
whenever his superior officers ordered the
cars to be moved they would be started
witnout Mr. Dockery's consent, whereupon
Dockery in a loud voice made the follow
ing proclamation:
"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye! In the
name of the Health Department of the
City and County of San Francisco and in
the presence of these witnesses I, James
Dockery, chief food inspector of the
Health Department of the said City ana
County, by the authority in me vested, do
quarantine these cars, without interfer
ence with their contents, and I charge you
(addressing Mr. Hardy) to duly observe
the fact and to be guided thereby."
A few moments later United States
Marshal Baldwin appeared with a paper
in his hand.
"Mr. Dockery," he said, "I have this
for you." â 
"A warrant?"
"Ye.."
"1 ben I am a United States prisoner?"
''You are."
"Very well, I will go with you."
â  ; ; DoiKerv was taken beiore United States
Commissioner Heacock and was released
on $300 bonds. J. W. Kerr and A. Bbar
boro being hi sureties. Tuesday morning
n<-xt, at 10:30, was fixed as the time for
the heariug. T| *ff___fftÃ. i l^iw*^^ l,^lltW t^
The complaint upon which the warrant
was issued reads as follows:
John H. Wise makes oath and says that on
the 21st day of May, 1897, at Sin Francisco in
the City and County of San Francisco and Dis
trict aforesaid then and the. c being, did un
lawfully and knowingly prevent, oppose, im
pede nnd interfere with an officer of the cus
toms to-wit, the Collector of Customs of the
Fort of San FranciÂ«eo, to wit, this affiant, in
the execution of his duties as such officer, and
in the execution of a power and authority in
him then and there vested by law, that is to
say, while the said Collector of Customs and
his deputies and persons assisting him were
there and then engaged in the transportation
and removal of a large quantity of distilled
spirits to the Collector of Customs of the Port
of New Yrk in pursuance of law the said
James P. Dockery did prevent such transpor
tation and removal- bysid Collector of Cus
toms by breaking into the receptacles in which
the said distilled spirits were contained and
emptying the same of their contents.
The second count of the complaint
charges that Dockery violated a Federal
statute by breaking into three packages of

lay claim to the estate, is declared .' a
forgery, pure and simple, by the Eastern heirs. Now. it happens that in matters of relationship the advantage thus far is
with Mrs. Catherine Stead of Philadelpnia, Rev. John P. Nelson of Winchester, Va., and Mrs. Jacob A. Nelson of Washing
ton. The first two named are niece and nephew, respectively, of the dead man. Mrs. Nelson is the widow of a nephew. On
the other hand, Miss Muir and Mrs. Curtis are nieces of the dead man's wife, and these varying degrees of kinship are to be
used, pro and con. as the lawyers may see fit -*'..*>,
The dead millionaire's real name was Dedilrer. It was a family feud between him and the nephews and niece that aro
now contesting the urn will that made' him assume the name of Davis. He might just as well have called himself Jones or
Smith, for that matter. . _ , - , â Â£_ 'Â» v f -* * . ~
The old Dunkaid Church in Germantown, Philadelphia, where Davis hoped to gather, ultimately, all the remains of his
dead relatives, is a historic landmark. From its steps Washington reviewed the Colonial army. Service was first-began in
the edifice in 1708, and it is worthy of note that the original communion service is now preserved in a vault in the church,
erected at Davis' expense. The relics, made of a rare German pottery now extinct, are literally worth their weight in cold,
for gold-smelters have frequently offered to replace them with similar articles made from the yellow metal.
The handwriting in the urn will is tremulous and uncertain. In explanation of this the attorneys for Mrs. Curtis and
Miss Muir say that, when he made it, Davit was a nervous and sick old man. The sample of the millionaire's genuine hand
writing is from a letter he wrote last July to John Sanderling, one of his distant relatives, in regard to the completion of the
wing of the Dunfcard Church at a cost of $10,000. -.-â¢,â â 
distilled spirits with an auger and de
stroying their contents, the said packages
being in the custody of the United States
under bond. ' .
Inspector Dockery denies, that the dis
tilled corn spirits, water and brandy were
under bonds at the â¢ time be tapped the
tbree barrels. There were no Government
stamps whatever on them, and in fact a
man came into tbe car with a handful of
stamps while Dock.ry was twisting the
auger and attempted to place them on the
barrels, but Dockery would not allow him
to do so. â [ .:;_',
The Food Inspector says that he was
acting under legal advice, _ to the.' effect
that the health laws oi the City and
County of San Francisco were enforceable
everywhere within the limits, except
upon ground owned by the United States,
and that the .only places within the City
and County where his . jurisdiction would
not prevail would be the" Central '; Post
office, the Appraisers' building, the new
Postoffice sue and the. Presidio reserva
tion.
The Manufacturers' Association and the
Pure Food Committee are very much
stirred up over the . matter and are deter
mined that the stuff shall', not be ex
ported to cause the ruin of the reputation
of California brandy,
It is stated 'that the alleged brandy was
to be sold at 28 cents : per gallon. Naval
Officer Irish and the others interested in
the good name of California will exercise
tbe utmost vigilance to prevent the dope
from being sent out of the City.
ln an interview yesterday Colonel Irish
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 23, IS9T.
stated as his opinion that it is the proper
way to take hold of the matter, as it will
be the means of setting forth the powers
of the Board of Health, as welt as show
ing the powers in connection with his
office. _
He added that the law requires that a
bonded manufacturing warehouse shall
file with him the formulas of the goods
they propose to manufacture. "This the
parties *in question have not complied
witb, and if they had brought this form
ula to my office to be: filled," continued
Colonel- Irish, "1 would have informed
them that such stuff . could not be ex
ported under the name of California
brandy.
"I shall telegraph and write to New
York and endeavor to have it stopped
there, and if necessary follow the article
clear through to London, England, and
have it seized there. *?_
'â¢I am informed that there is worse stuff
than . this ' manufactured 'by these parties,
but as it is not being exported it does not
come under my jurisdiction. . â¢
"This thing is nothing more than an
attempt to use the laws of the United
States to shelter sophistication and fraud,
and I don't propose that they shall be Used
in that manner if : I have anything to say
about it"
The health authorities propose to arrest
the owner of the 105 barrels. It is reported
that T. H. Froelich is the man.
FOUND ON CEDROS ISLAND
Captain Pickens and a Sea-
man of the Ida on
the Orizaba.
Their Little Fishing Schooner
Was Capsized During a
Squall.
. The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Orizaba arrived late last night
after a spicy voyage of twelve days from
Guaymas, Mexico, and" way ..ports. 'â  i The
steamer . carried "' a large number tof
passengers, I among them two' ship
wrecked mariners, Captain Pickens and
one "of i the f crew of * 'the little _; fishing
schooner Ida of San . Diego, which was
wrecked on ; the â¢rock- bound coast sof
Cedros Island several weeks aeo. **.
"On May* 19th," said Captain Ton
Helms of the Orizaba in bis report to the
Merchants' J" Exchange, '. "while ; V passing
Low Point, north end of Cedros Island,
the*,; shin was â  hailed:; --by ci a boat
containing Dr.' 'F. G. : Powers, ;*, who
is the;, keeper, .of- mining property
at Low; Point, and three J, men, Captain
John i Pickens and; his two; seamen. We
took Captain Pickens and one of his sea
men aboard, the other sailor preferring to
remain on the island to keep Dr. Powers
and his ; mother, who "-: were . the ', only * in
habitants of the island, company. '.!...
"On the"; trip Captain Pickens told the
story of. the wrecking of his little craft.
The Ida was cruising in the vicinity of
Cedros Island, where . tbe * fishing is good,'
when suddenly. a squall came up and the
schooner capsized. ," V

FEATURES OF ANOTHER
BIG WILL CONTEST.
, In his life no man was more adverse to
notoriety and noise than Jacob Z. Davis.;
A ';; plain "â â  man, as :â â  word * goes, \he
pursued the even tenor of his way, ac
cumulating and acquiring, and as far as
his personal wishes went, he might have
lived a century and never been 1 known
or heard of outside the circle of his'rela
tives and immediate business associates.
But with his death f all . was changed.
Behind him be -left; $2,000, 000, a snug
sum even in these days of bonanza kings,
and the fight that is about to begin in
the courts. for his estate promises to
take precedence of the Fair case in many
of its features. . * _Â* r
There was a kindly vein in the dead
man's disposition, in marked contrast to
the acerbity that characterizes" the strug
gle for his riches. In his life Davis was
the friend of every dumb animal. His
heirs are preparing for a regular monkey
and-parrot fig. it for the rich pickings of
his frugality. , _.-_
The will, under which Mrs. John M.
Curtis and Miss Lizzie Muir, of this City,
perately to gain a hold on tbe upturned
hull as it drifted toward the island.
They finally succeeded and held in
their perilous positions until the little
boat bumped the shore. Tbe shipwrecked
crew then made its way to Dr. Powers'
house, where it remained : until the ar
rival of the Orizaba.
"Dr. Powers was completely out of pro
visions, and was supplied with flour ana
bacon sufficient to last bim for several
weeks, at least until another vessel laden
with necessaries of life passes the island."
Captain yon Helms also reported that the
Mexican gasoline schooner J ose tine, wbic_
sailed from San Jose del Cabo for En
senada, with a cargo of Panoche sugar and
tan-ark, had not reached Ensenada when
the Orizaba left that port. It was said at
San Jose del Cabo that the two engines of
the josefine were broken down when she
left,' and considerable anxiety is felt con
cerning her. . . V

ROW OVER THE
CITY HALL ROOF
The Mayor Sides With
the Complaining Metal-
Roofers.
Declares He Will Net Sign De
mands for Pay for the
Work.
Broderick md Creswell Stand to
. Their Guns An Investigation to
Be ' Held., ,
The members of the City Hall Commis-
Mayor Phelan, Auditor Broderick
and City and County Attorney Cres well
had their first fight over City Hall con
struction matters yesterday and for a time ;
the discussion threatened to become acri
monious. -/i/v ?â ",.--.-;-.:
Some time ago a committee of metal
roofers called on the ;i Mayor and repre
sented that the, roof was. not being con
structed in a proper manner or according
to specifications, and asked that he make
an investigation. He looked into the con
tracts; and. later stated that there was
nothing to base the complaints on.
Later, '. however, he .' sent a metal-roofer
as an expert to examine the roof as to its
capability of resisting/the sun and rain.
This person reported that the cement that
covers the corrugated iron is certain to
crack under the hot sun of summer, and
that leaks will follow, because the specifi
cations for the gutters have been . so
changed that the channels will not catch
the leakage, but will permit it to seep
into the walls and thus into the building.
When - the Commissioners met â¢: yester
day the Mayor was primed with the re
port, and when a committee of the metal
roofers made a protest against the work
going on he backed them up. ' : ;;jv f
Engineer Mollis denied the statements
of the men that the roof was not being
constructed according to specifications,
but their complaint was championed by
the Mayor, who said that if the plans were
not arranged so as to insure a roof that
would not leak he would refuse to sign de
mands for payment of the work.
"1 am inclined to give credence to the
statements made by these men," said the
Mayor. "They are dissatisfied wor_men,
and are, of course, desirous of bringing to
light all defective work that is being done
on the roof. For the purpose of satisfying
myself I have called in experts to aid me
in my investigations, and they have cor
roborated the statements of the mechan
ics. The roof is being constructed of con
crete laid on a flexible iron frame, and it
will surely shrink and crack, and the cop
per gutterings having been eliminated,
the rain will not be carried away. Now,
in view of these lact**, I desire to say that
1 intend to place the responsibility upon
the gentlemen ot this commission who
awarded the coutract, and 1 will not sign
demands for payments under the contract
until it can be demonstrated that we are
having a root built that will not leak.''
Then Commissioners Broderick and
Creswell grew wrathful. They declared
that the style of roof now being con
structed had been selected after a careful
study of authorities on roofs; that they
had consulted competent engineers, who
were far better able to judge of its merits
than those who had reported it to be
faulty.
"No roof was ever constructed that
would not leak," declared Auditor Brod
erick, "and you will not be able to get a
demonstration that it will not leak. It
will probably let in some storm water.' I
want to say right here, however, tbat it is
as good a roof as can be constructed, and
lam willing to take the responsibility of
going right on with construction."
Commissioner Creswell expressed him
self likewise, and added that the commis
sion had known for. eighteen months that
roofers interested in rival styles â *; would
object to the work and try "i to pick flaws in
it in order to throw discred it on the com
mission and the manufacturers of the ma
terials used.
Mayor Phelan insisted â  that a mistake
bad been made in changing the copper
gutterways to cement j channels, but the
Auditor disagreed with. him, stating that
copper gutterways gave malicious persons
a chance to cut them and flood the build
ing either for spite or to give mechanics
an opportunity to repair them. ; :
He stated that holes in the old roof that
were supposed to have been caused by
rust had. been shown to have been cut
with chisels and that it had cost several
hundred dollars to repair the damages.
He demonstrated to the satisfaction of
himself and Mr. Creswell that the .olid
cement gutters contemplated would
not leak perceptibly, and that because of
the pitch of the roof the damage of cracks
and leaks on the slopes was small.
He also' stated that the Commissioners
had been influenced to do away with the
copper by reason of the experience of the
Capitol at Sacramento, where whole sec
tions of metal , had been lorn off and
stolen. If, however, there was anything
in the story that the iron used is not up
to specifications - the Auditor desired . an
', investigation, and it was decided to in
spect the roof during the week and probe
the matter thoroughly.

No words could so vividly portray the change*) which forty years have
wrought in the material face of San Francisco as do the silhouette out
lines which are presented on this page. The originals of these were taken
from a point tbat threw the toplines of the City distinctly against the
western sky. The first illustration is drawn from a picture somewhat
similar to it which was made in 1857. ""
The second is reproduced from a photograph taken in 1887, thirty years
later. The third is from a sketch made this week by a Call artist on the
ferry-boat from San Francisco to Oakland.
In the upper illustration appears little more than a range of sand
hills. Looked at from a distance, say two miles, there was scarcely a
mark or an object to distinguish them from any ordinary range of hills
in California. The sky lines were unbroken and comparatively smooth
from a removed view point.
Lower down there could be discerned several of the more prominent
buildings of those early day.: â buildings long since permitted to crumble
down in humble subjection to a loftier and more modern era of archi
tecture and a greater commercial demand. M _/*!
In the foreground, .skirting the dull strip of earth, are scattered a cos
mopolitan fleet of merchant, vessels, which in those days had their noses
pointed gold ward and were as much miners of the sea as their human
brother rovers of '49 were miners of the land.
In the middle view, representing a period three decades removed from
that of the foregoing view, may be perceived evidences of modern de
velopment in somewhat spasmodic or extreme architectural attempts.
The Palace Hotel was in those awakening times the cynosure of eyes
witn an awe of magnitude and a reverence for cost.
The Hopkins and a few neighboring mansions arose on Nob Hill and
began to disturb the hitherto even lines of the City's silhouette.
The "new" City Hall, which ten years ago had outgrown the last
human being who dared to predict that it would some day be finished
was then in the heyday of its newness, minus the tower and a few other
incidental appurtenances. The shot tower was towering away then as

bard as it has ever towered since, and the shot were dropping through it
a good deal more tbickiy and to a much better purpose than shot ever fell
in the Greek and Turkish war. Â .., '.'.;.,*:'â ;_ . Â'â 
Wharves and docks had taken the place of a scraggly beach. Lai ger
and better ships had sailed through tbe Golden Gate, j International com
merce had laid its hand upon San Francisco, and was beginning to raise
it to the prominence which it to-day occupies as a seaport metropolis.
The third view, when suddenly compared with the first, produces the.
effect of magic. What a wonderful transformation! The even-topped
hills have disappeared like the mists of morning before the summer sun,
and in their places is a modern city of tbe first rank. And it is a
beautiful city, with the grandest sky line in a/1 the world. It is artistic
in composition, and when seen against a glorious western sheet. of clouds
is sublimr*.
The valley which lay between the bills, the center of which is now
Market street, fairly bristles with lofty structures. â¢'â  These all rise from
about the same level, so that the various heights can be compared when
seen from across the bay. The highest of these is, of course, This Call
building, now rapidly nearing completion. Â§| It rises, a graceful tower, from
a group of splendid structure-, to about 400 feet above the surface of the
bay, or .15 feet from the sidewalk where it stands. This splendid struct,
ure forms the pyramid line of a group of buildings.
Near by is the Palace Hotel, which was large once, but now appears
to have shrunk by comparison. | Just opposite is the tower of the Chron
icle building, aiso looking less lofty now than it once did. ' 'â 
Right round this section of town tall buildingsâ commonly called
"sky-scrapers"â stick np on all sides. There is the Crocker building, in
reality wedge-shaped, but appearing as a huge block in spile of the fact
that many people claim to see in its outlines a suggestion of the shape of
a slice of wedding-cake.
Almost mingling with the Crocker building is the Hobart block, occu
pied by the offices of the. Southern Pacific Company. ; A little further to
the north can be seen the Mills building. This structure seems to stand
by itself, so niuch taller is it than its neighbors. Tbe Pacific Mutual and
the Mutual Life buildings look like twins. They are not, of course, but
such they must be conceded to be in the sky lines.
On the south the old shot-tower looks as it used to do a decade ago.
but a change has come over that "new" City Hall â a -renter change even
than tbe architect designer ever dieamed his work would be evolved into*
But it is there, and the big dome rises proudly heavenward, looking just
as though it bad been built to furnish a jumping-off place for the angel
on the top.
; The tall buildings are for tbe most part graceful in outline and make
good silhouettes. They form into good composition; and make tbe finest
kind of a background for the many ships that come through the finest
gateway of a great Nation. Â *j - â ..{.' ' .>'â ".
Now that we know what San Francisco's sky line looks like, and bow
it has changed within the last half century, it might be well to compare
it with the sky line of other * big cities of the world. â First, however, it
must be borne in mind that the skylines of the other large cities are not
as easily seen as San Francisco's. San Francisco's shows to better advan
tage any other city's. Â. - â¢* .- _ - *._.'_". . Â»-" â¢
; The site occupied by the City at the Golden Gate has been conceded
by travelers to be the finest in the world, without exception. Of course,
there are finer sites occupied by smaller cities, such as Monaco, but tbey
can hardly be considered in this list. The wonderful bay of San Fran-,
cisco, surrounded by bills and dotted with islands, and with rivers empty
ing into it from all sides, provides a background, or setting, that no other
city is blessed with. -"*â  1* -Â«.â '; .' â¢ " % . -.
* 'The fact that one can go half way between San Francisco and Oakland
and from that point get a view of all the City also give* its sky line a
quality of its own. Most of the large cities of tbe world are so situated
that their sky lines, such as they are, cannot be seen except at too short a
range or too great a range. Bat they, would not amount to much even if
they could be seen. : : -.^ : . * V :.""'.' V.;rl.*._v.
London, the largest city in the world, in reality; has no -sky line at
all. Looking across the Thames on one of the clearest days of tbe year
all that can be seen is a flat expanse of buildings with the towers of tbe
Houses of Parliament, Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral and a few
churches rising above tbe rest. The circumstance that the other build
ings in the city are very high destroys much of the effect which might
exist if such were not the case.
Pans, like London, is a flat wilderness of housetops, broken only by
chimney-pots. Above this rise the. Arch of Triumph, the towers of
Notre Dame and other churches, the Opera, tbe Invalides, as well as the
famous Eiffel tower. From some directions the tower of the Pautheon
shows us part of the sky line, but from that view the other buildings can
not be seen. Compared to San Francisco's sKy line it is nothing.
Rome's sky line might be good if it were possible to see it. But this
cannot be done, because the' Tiber is too narrow and the surrounding
country is higher than the city. Certain portions of Rome, as can be
seen from certain points, present beautiful silhouettes of an impressive
ness not to be found in any other part of the world. But a complete view

ENGLAND'S CELEBRATION
BRISTOL, Em.., May
10. â England is cele
bratine the fourth cen
tenary of the voyage of
John Cabot, who no
less an authority than

TO HONOR CABOT'S DISCOVERY OF NORTH AMERICA
Cabot, rather than Columbus, discovered
the continent of North America.
John Cabot was a Genoese by birth,
but went to Venice, where he resided from
1461 to 1476. He married there and became
a Venetian citizen. At the end of the
period mentioned he went to Spain and
Portugal, where he learned of the plans of
Columbus to sail westward in search of
the mythical Isle of Cathay. After this
he emigrated to England with his wife
and three sons in the year 1494 March 4,
1497, Henry VII granted . him letters
patent permitting him and his three sons
to fit out ship*, under the protection of the
English flag.
Under these auspices, therefore, Cabot
accomplished the undertaking that make
it necessary, according to Sir Clements
Markham, president of the Royal Geo

La Joda Creek has its sources on Mount
Howell, and, after accumulating in vol

Nine miles from the city of St. Helena it
passes - through La Joda chasms, a great

to the top with lofty timber, festooned
with vines and crowded with shrubbery. ,
Here the creek makes a rapid descent
over the rocks which have fallen from
the sides of the chasm above, form

beauty as it proceeds on its turbulent
course. At La Joda Falls the stream de

The place is wild and difficult of ac

1 out a small vessel in . 1497 , called
i the Matthew. : The crew consisted of
eighteen men, all of whom were British
sailors except two, a Burgundian and a
barber from , Castigliona, a place near
Genoa, in Italy. Cabot's plan was the
same as that of | Columbus to sail west
ward until he reached the ports of Cathay
and Cipansjo. May 3, 1497, the Matthew
set sail' from Bristol on her memorable
voyage. Cabot passed Ireland and then
shaped a northerly course, finally navigat
ing to the west, having the north star on
his l right. Having wandered thus lor a
.time,' he at length reached land, where" he
hoisted the royal standard and took pos
session. T. i-. ;-;'' ; "â "'.'â ",Â«'â¢' . : . '"''V'''-.'.
It is believed that this was at a point in
or about Cape Race. Certainly. it was
between the two landfalls. ' Cabot called
it the Cape of England. This was on June
4, 1497, St. John's day,* and the island that
was found that same day was called St.
John, believed to be the present location
of St. Johns, Newfoundland. On Cabot's
map, which is still in existence, a large
island called St.Juan is placed to the
west of Cape Breton in the position of the
Magdalena group. The map shows New
foundland as a detached group of small
islands. President Markbam believes
that Cabot made a landing at Cape Bona
vista, on the east coast of Newfoundland.
The chart that Cabot sent to Spain in
1489 has a coast line which seems to indi
cate that the Matthew sailed I along the
south coast of Newfoundland.
The first voyage of John Cabot was the
first successful exhibition of discovery
which sailed from an English port. Those
who place credence in the statements of
his son S.bastian believe that he passed
Cape Race in thick weather and made a
landing on Cape Breton on June 24.
Those who reject the evidence of Sebas
tian Cabot's map believe that he lauded
at Bonuvista Bay, not necessarily on June
24, then coasted along the south coast of
Newfoundland until he was in sight of
Cape Breton, returning nearer the land so
as to pass the islands of St. Pierre and
Miquelon at the right.
Much confusion was caused both by
early writers and their modern com
mentators, owing to the events of the sev
eral 1 voyages made by Cabot being con
founded. Letters that are still in exist
ence, written by two men named Pasqua
ligo and Soncino, refer to the first voyage,
though several writers have made the
mistake of declaring the second voyage
the subject matter of the documents. The
statements of Sebastian Cabot, which
A COMPASS THAT IS ALWAYS TRUE
The Invention of a San Francisco Man That Promises to Be of
Incalculable Value to Navigators.
Ever since man began to navigate the
tempestuous ocean and to find bis way
across the trackless waste with the aid of
the slim, directing finger in the compass,
otherwise known as the magnetic needle,
be has been conscious of various defects
and shortcomings on the part of that Val
uable monitor. .â ]'â â¢
The mariner's compass has been de
flected from the path of rectitude, so to
speak, by magnetism and by atmospheric
electricity. The electrical influences may,
if an invention recently patented by Cap
tain C. F. Swan, a San Francisco shipmas
ter, works as well in practice as it does in
theory, do much to prevent electrical de
flection of the needle. â . .: â 
The invention is, in brief, an electrically
insulated compass. Speaking of the fact
that the majority of the ships are now
made of iron Captain Swan says:
"That the ship's metal acts as a reser
voir for the accumulation of electricity no
experienced seaman, or astute scientific
man can doubt. ' The construction of iron
ships is such that the metallic plating cov
ering the ship's hull is in direct contact
with her stem and stern posts. These lat
ter in their turn are connected with each
other through the cavity -of the - ship's
hull by two horizontal and perpendicular
supports. This simple arrangement will
admit of electrical currents, for v forms in
I itself a complete electrical current.
, '.'Further, this admissible current may
traverse various sections of the ship, ac
cording to circumstances. An electrical
current may establish itself, following the
fore and aft medium line of the ship, and
by means of the vessel's outer plating* and
vice versa, as the case may j be. In the
movement of a vessel through .'the water
immense force is consumed in friction
and resistance, and this certainly results
in the generation of electricity to a greater
or lesser : degree, the metal entering into
the construction of a ship acting as its
reservoir or storehouse." ."*
The suggestion of electricity produced
by the friction of a ship's hull upon the
water struck one or two gentlemen to
whom the matter was suggested as new.
Captain Swan's application of this claimed
fact is this: "If ;. the friction of | water
against the iron plating of a ship's' hull
will generate electricity, and : the' metal
will m it ' of ' a ; current, we ! find ? an ex
planation for the alternate. deviation of
compass needles when the ship is directed
upon either jj a * northerly or \ ';â  southerly
course,* and laboring in a rough, beam *-ea.
"That side of the ship that is buried
most fully j beneath the surface of ; the
water must necessarily generate the most
electricity. The ; currents .; generated by
either ) side of the \ ship preponderate al
ternately as the ship rolls in ; the sea;
consequently the needle deflects regu
larly." - - . 'â¢.
Captain Swan, having figured out to his
own satisfaction that; the .;: sudden - devi
ations of .the compass' are. due to .elec
tricity to a very large /extent,; went to
work to see what could be done to make
the : compass . more reliable as a guide.
He has . constructed a binnacle, composed,
wholly of non-conducting materials and
insulated j completely. Within ; this bin
nacle i the f. compass : Is * worked â¢â â  within a
vacuum, which in turn is within a second
! were reported by Ramusio and Peter
J Martyr, referred to the second voyage.
When John Cabot returned to Eng
land he was received with enthusiasm,
and the King gave him a grant of $50 for
discovering North America, besides al- .
lowing him a pension of $100 a year. Ca
bot lived at Bristol for a time with bis
family, but fon : - February 3, 1498. fresh
letters patent were granted him by Henry
VII to take six ships for the further dis
covery of "new isles." It was Cabot's
fond hope that by sailing westward he
might reach Cipango. Like the first ex
pedition the second was fitted out at Bris
tol. One ship of the fleet was commanded
by Lancelot Thirkill, an experienced nav
igator from London, who secured a royal
loan of $150 with which to equip a ship.
Thomas Thirkill commanded a second
vessel and secured a similar loan, as did
Thomas Bradley, who commanded a
third. A fourth vessel was captained by
John Carter, who rece ved a loan of
$201 25. In the records of Cabot's expe
ditions all the men whose names are given
are referred to as "going to the newe
isle."
This expedition, by far the most notable
which ever set sail up to that time and for
such a purpose, consisted of ' five vessels.
The crews numbered 300 men and they
sailed for the mysterious west in the
spring of 1495. This is the last that was
ever known of John Cabot, so far as his
torical records tell us. His fate and the
date of his death are unknown. Whether
he perished at sea or j whether he reached
some laud and died there no modern man
can say. Sebastian Cabot, the ~ nnd utiful
son, was a pilot like his : father. His char
acter is indicated by the fact that while
he was in Spain subsequent to his father's
death he spoke of his lather's second voy
age as if he (Sebastian) had not
only commanded the expedition, but
fitted it out at his own expense. In all
the various statements to increase his
own glory, Sebastian Cabot never men
tioned his father, except to utter the false
hood that the father was dead before the
voyages of discovery were made, and that
he, Sebastian, fitted out and commanded
the expeditions.
This falsifier and unworthy son was not
even a good liar, for he did not stick to
vacuum. More particular description is
given in Captain Swan's own words:
| "Within an outer polished-glass globe
of any dimension and a half inch in thick
ness is a second or inner glass globe of
similar description, which is supported at
a distance of j two inches from the inner
surface, of the outer globe by six gutta
percha rings. Each globe is div ; ded hori
zontally into hemispheres, which are ad
justed to each other and rendered air
tight by means of a rubber fitting. From
the compass, which occupies the inner
globe, the air is exhausted, leaving the
needle in a vacuum.
"The hemispheres of the globe are then
adjusted and the air is exhausted. The
inner globe is also suspended within a
vacuum, which has within its cavity a
second vacuum, which represents the po
sition of the needle. The entire apparatus
is then clothed in a gutta-percha covering,
not only to protect the glass, but to serve
as additional insulation, and is thoroughly
insulated from the deck by similar mate
rials." '-. _-."* â¢ 'â¢- '::.

Sebastian Cabot â loaded down as they
are with falsehood, which have come
down to us giving the detail of the second
voyage of John t , Cabot . .President Mark
ham believes that the great navigator, or
the English captain who commanded after
his death, went north along the coast of
Labrador until is progress was checked
by ice, then retracing his journey and
going as far south as Cape Hatleras. 'It
is known that, one of Cabot's captains,
the Lancelot Thirkill mentioned, returned
home safely from his second voyage. It
is further known that the wife of Gasper
Corte Real, one of the men who accom
panied the expedition, went to Lisbon in
October, 1501, taking with her from North
America a broken piece of sword, gilded,
which was certainly made in Italy, and she
reported that she had seen two silver
rings of Venetian workmanship in .the
possession of a native' North American
boy. These' articles must have been left
by Cabot's people in 1498.
John Cabot was, as stated, the first to
lead Englishmen across the Atlantic, and
his voyage must, therefore, be ever mem
orable*. It is only possible to form a judg
ment of the character of Cabot that is
correct, for whatever opinion we may hold
is based on only a few recorded facts.
Still it is certain that he was a scientific
seaman and a good navigator, energetic,
brave and persevering. Those qualities
were absolutely necessary to successfully
accomplish the enterprise undertaken by
him. He must have combined practical
abilities with imagination and enthusi
asm. A foreigner and at first unknown,
he must also have possessed the faculty of
winning the confidence of his men and of
gathering around him the most able and
daring seamen of the time. '-.'
Summing up all the matters relative to
Cabot's death it is possible to learn of, if

flective tendency and will continually do
so as long as our present compass bin

sert that sudden deflection of the compass
needle is due either directly or indirectly
to electrical influences. It may be due
directly to the passage of electrical cur
rents in the vicinity of the needle or indi
rectly to the magnetization of metal caused
by similar currents."
Captain Swan makes an interesting
claim to the effect that sudden deviations
of the needle, which are observed in damp
or foggy weather on metallic ships, do not
take place upon wooden vessels, simply
because wood is of a low conducting
power. "The: metallic vessel must," he
say-*, "under j all circumstances act to a
greater or less degree as an electrical
reservoir and the degree to which it is "so
influenced wili depend upon the surround
ings. For instance, in fair weather, when
the clouds float high above the ocean's
surface, 5 there is not so great a tendency
toward electrical interchange between
tbem and the earth's surface. The greater
degree to which a ship's metal acts as an
electrical reservoir the greater must be
any established electrical current that
may circulate through the ship, and con
seauently the greater the needle deflec
tion."

Cabot probably died soon after his st-oT*

this only in the minds of scientists could
account for the utter absence of any state

it is only, fair to say that the credit of com

M. Deibler, when he had the misfortune
to lose his wife a short time ago, gave evi
dence of the fact that constant intercourse
with death and the sight of the dead had
not robbed him of the sensitiveness per

intimate surroundings. He was mani
festly overcome at the graveside and the
impression he gave of the genuineness of
his grief was such that nobody suggested
that he was actingâ expert as all French
people are in that art.
In private life, it is said, be and his wife
were bound by the closest ties of affection,
which likewise linked them with their
children. - No attempt was- made to con
ceal the nature of his calling from them,
and Mme. Deibler was, it is said, even
proud of her husband's profession. Her
character was - based on ; strictly religious

regarded her husband as an instrument in
the hands of Providence for the punish

Now that a movement is in progress to erect a Lincoln monument in
Golden Gate Park the public is eager to read almost any incidents that
may be related of the life and character of the -vondorful man whose
memory it is proposed thus to honor. In fact, the time is a long way. off
when the American people will cease to be interested, in anything per
taining to the life and character of Abraham Lincoln. It is_with this fact
in view that I. now present some reminiscences' of that great man, who
was the most unique character in the history of his country, It was my
good fortune to be raised in a portion of Illinois contiguous to Lincoln's
old "stamping ground," and to have a slight personal acquaintance with
him from the time when he first became conspicuous as a political
speaker to the day of his untimely death. I saw him at various times
and under a variety of circumstances, both previous to his election to the
Presidency, and afterward. He was a man who compelled others to
almost unconsciously become absorbed in the study of his peculiar char
acteristics. The first time I ever saw him I also saw Stephen A. Douglas,
and on that occasion an incident occurred that forcibly illustrated Liu
coin's natural keenness at repartee.
It was in the fall of 1854 or 1555, I am not quite positive as to the date.
Some great public exhibition was in progress at Springfield, 111., and the
town contained a large percentage of visitors. Lincoln and Douglas were
there, and the respective friends of those popular men arranged to have a
speech from each of them. The meetings were held in the daytime, so
that visiting farmers might conveniently attend. The place s;lected was
Representative Hall in the old State House. It was before the anti
slavery element in the Whig and Democratic parties bad crystallized into
the Republican party. Lincoln was still a stanch Whig of the Henry
Clay school. The country was intensely interested in the slavery ques
tion, in consequence of the repeal of the ' Missouri Compromise, by which
action it became possible for slavery to be established in the then Terri
tories of Kansas and Nebraska whenever they should adopt State consti
tutions and be admitted into the Union. Douglas was the chief cham
pion of the repeal, and on this he based bis pet theory of "popular
sovereignty." He was ready and anxious to defend his theory on the
stump, whenever occasion offered. And be did it with great earnestness
and consummate skill. But in the Whig party of the North there was a
powerful anti-slavery element, which, though not committed to aboli
tionism, viewed with alarm the steady encroachments of the slave
power, and would under no conditions acquiesce in the introduction of
the institution of human slavery into territory which was supposed to be
forever dedicate! to freedom.
The men who composed this element had no intention of interfering
with the institution where it then existed, but they wished to keep it
within those limits, and they hoped at no distant day to see it placed
where, as Mr. Lincoln afterward expressed it, "the public mind would
rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction." In the
front rank of the ami-slavery Whigs stood Abraham Lincoln, and he had
reasons for anti-slavery principles wh'ch he was neither ashamed nor
afraid to promulgate. On the occasion referred to Mr. Douglas addressed
an immense mass-meeting in the forenoon, Mr. Lincoln being in the au
dience, listening carefully and "taking notes." Douglas spoke eloquently
and fervently, laying a foundation of error and building thereupon a su
perstructure of sophistry well calculated to deceive superficial minds.
He was listened to respectfully by Whigs and wildly applauded by Demo
crats. In the course of his speech he asserted that "the Whigs were all
dead."
In the afternoon, by appointment, Lincoln replied to the "Little
Giant." The audience completely filled the room, there being quite a
sprinkling of Democrats present. For some time before beginning to
speak Lincoln sat on the platform with only his homely face visible to the
audience above the high desk before him. On being introduced he arose
from his chair and proceeded to straighten himself up. For a few sec
onds I wondered when and where his head would cease its ascent. But at
last it did, and "Honest Old Abe" stood before us. After the applause
with which he was greeted had measurably subsided the speaker said:
"Fellow-citizens: My friend Mr. Douglas made the startling an
nouncement to-day that the Whigs were all dead. If this be so, fellow
citizens, you will now experience the novelty of hearing a speech from a
dead man! And I suppose you might propeny say, in the language of
the old hymn:
"Hark, from the tomb, a doleful sound!"
This unexpected sally of wit set tho audience fairly wild with delight,
and at once brought them into full sympathy with the speaker. As soon
as the prolonged laughter and cheer, would permit him again to be heard,
Lincoln proceeded to discuss the merits of the speech made by the elo
quent champion of "popular sovereignty." He analyzed the arguments
and tore open the sophistries of bis opponent in a masterly manner
showing by incontrovertible facts how dangerous to human liberty were
the teachings of Douglas ; and his coadjutors. For incisive logic, solid
facts, sparkling wit and thrilling eloquence Lincoln's speech greatly ex
celled anything I had ever heard from the stump. It stamped him as a
statesman of commanding ability, and more than one person who
listened to him was afterward heard to say, 'Old Abe will yet be Presi
dent of the United States," although it is not supposable that Lincoln â 
himself at that time had any such expectation. â¢-;,.- : ; - â¢â J"*-.*-'; â¢/â¢*_*â  /-- '.;*v^ ; f Â«â¢â¢ â¢.-.

candidate for President, John C. Fremont, was running against Bu

from far and near, and the speaker's audience was computed by acres
rather than by numbers. He spoke for more than two hours, interspers

"Oh 1 I thought you belonged here."
"Well, 1 do," he said, taking a piece of

some way, either as a good citizen in time

As a public speaker Mr. Lincoln was as unique as he was in other
phases of his character. I have heard nearly every one of. the great ora

past thirty-five years. Several of them excelled Lincoln in a few particu
lars, but not in all the elements of charming oratory. Lincoln's public
utterances lacked such auxiliaries as the polished manners of Charles
Sumner, the unimpassionea eloquence of Wendell Phillips, the scathing
invective of Roscoe Conkling or Robert G. Ingersoll and the rolling thun

style of private conversation. I remember that on one occasion when he
was prominently before the people as a probable United States Senator
he happened to spend an hour in a hotel in the quiet town of Griggsv ill?,
111. Several Illinoisians, old and young, the writer among them, gathered

beneath it, he suddenly paused in the conversation, passed one hand over
bis rather rough face and springing to his, feet exclaimed: : "Gentlemen,
befoie that stage comes for me I must attend to a little matter that seems
to require it. If you will all excuse me I think I'll 'go out and hunt a

pertains to ; the mere animal. These expressions showed the humani

unconscious that the eyes of the Nation were upon him. â â -'.' / *
The next time I saw Lincoln, alive, was at the White House at Wash
ington, in the fall of 1864. He had. served the people as -President one
term, and was then a candidate for re-election. While strolling through
the White House grounds I learned that a military band was about to
serenade the President.; So I went to the north veranda of the Executive
Mansion, where the band played several popular airs. In due time tho
President came out, bowed to the throng, and, in response to an irresistible
clamor, made a brief speech in his characteristic vein. But he looked
haggard and care-worn. There was an expression of sadness on his face,
as if the shadow of some terrible calamity yet to come had fallen noon the
man who carried in his heart the burdens of the Nation. Sitting on the
veranda close to where the President stood, I happened to notice his feet.
In the side of his right boot was a hole nearly an inch long, through
which his white sock was plainly visible. ' This harmless gap simply con
firmed the popular belief that "Old Abe" was inclined to be careless in
his dress. He no doubt was careless as to details, though he was certainly
neat and cleanly. Â«-'Â£ . Â»'â¢â â â¢ '.â "?*-.*â¢-â¢ 'â¢'-, 'â¢ "; â : , j?'t.j* ._'.
The next and last time I looked upon the face of Abraham Lincoln it
was cold in death. It was in April, 1865. His remains were lying in state
at the City Hall, New York, and the Nation was in mourning. '.-, Of course
everybody in and near the city desired to take a look at the remains of
the martyred President, but only a small percentage of the hundreds of
thousands who attempted was successful, although the body lay in state
for about two days, if my memory serves me. By standing in the proces
sion two hours and a half, at the risk of being crushed, I succeeded in.
gaining access to the death chamber, where I beheld the cold, bloodless
form of that great man whose 1 tra_*ic death by the hand of a cowardly
assassin had weighted the hearts of the people with sorrow unspeakable.
The form of the martyr, the burial outfit, the uniforms and gleaming
bayonets of the soldier guards, feebly illuminated by a few gas-jets over
head, formed a weird scene of oppressive sadness such as must have made
a lasting impression on the mind of every person who silently moved past
the head of the casket and gazed for a moment on that once luminous but
now expressionless face.
During the period while the funeral-car was being conveyed, by a cir
cuitous route, from Washington to Chicago and thence to Springfield, an
incident of special, interest resulting from the assassination occurred in
Brooklyn. -Rev. Henry Ward Beecher had been appointed by President
Lincoln a member of a special commission to visit Charleston and, with
imposing ceremonies, re-erect the stars and stripes on the ramparts of
Fort Sumter. The Commissioners performed that pleasant task, but be
fore they returned home the President was murdered. The first Sunday
after Mr. Baecher's return he delivered a discourse in the nature of a
funeral sermon over the deceased. President. The occasion drew to Ply
mouth Church perhaps forty times as many people as could possibly get
inside the building. Policemen in and around the house were kept busy
trying to prevent people from crushing each other in their eagerness to
force their way in. I was one of the fortunate persons who effected an
entrance. The eulogy delivered by Mr. Beecher was grandly eloquent,
pathetic and, touching. Ho was at his best and he made the most of the
remarkable opportunity. He paid a glowing tribute to the martyred
President, and with his resonant voice, tremulous with emotion, so stirred
the hearts of that great audience that nearly all present wept as if they
were in attendance at the obsequies of some dearly loved personal friend.
The New York funeral demonstration over the murdered President
was' another never-to-be-forgotten event. From the St. Nicholas Hotel I
obtained an unobstructed view of the great cortege while it moved slowly
through Broadway, bearing the remains to a railroad station for convey
ance toward their final, resting place. Uncounted thousands of spectators
viewed the solemn pageant, which was one of the largest and most impos
ing the world, has ever seen. Numerous and variegated were the emblems
of mourning borne by individuals and organizations. But not one was
more touching, not one more deeply impressive than the simple emblem
carried on a piece of draped iramework by a dozen colored men. It was a
.beautiful white monument, made of light material, with? four sides. On
-each side.was the representation of Â« dial, with the hands pointing to 22
minutes past 7. o'clockâ the hour at which the great soul of the martyr
had parsed out of its shattered prison into the broader realms and clearer
Tight of an eternal day. Beneath each dial were the words, "The Darkest
Hour in Our Country's History." .- f
And so* it was. For when Abraham L'.ncoln died the Nation lost a
model /President,' the cause of justice one of its bravest champions/ nnd
humanity one of its truest friends." '__. (| 5 * Ralph Hoyt.
Maxine Elliott Gives Her Views
Concerning Dress.
My views on dress? Dear, dear 1: I'm
alraid they would , be no "goturior to cry
by," as some Mrs. Mai apron has said.
If you will allow the eagle to scream a
little, I must declare that in my opinion
American women are the best dressed as
a class, but with most of us it is a case of
we propose and the' dressmakers dispose.
Individually, my experience has been that
the frocks we plan so carefully never quite
come up to our 'roseate expectations, ex
cept in that Mecca of Americans, Paris,
and in, Brussels', which, by the way, is
quite the nicest place to buy clothes in
that I. know, if one's pocket-book has a'
limit. Brussels is infinitely cheaper than
Paris, and they have all the latest models
from Pao.uin, Felix, Raudinitz '"'and
Doucet. .._.._ *â¢ 'â¢ -'*
I am seriously contemplating a raid this
summer upon those fascinating little
shops in the Rue Montague de la Cour.
i/jl have often been asked whether or not
lam personally "responsible for the de
signing and' supervision of the making of
my stage gowns. To* this I must say that
if one strives to- have the smallest indi
viduality it is an absolute necessity, to so
do, is :. it not ; Be - the modiste ever so
tasteful one gets so well acquainted wiih
one's ; own good and bad points, so' to
speak, that in the frantic endeaver to hide
the bad and accentuate the good we must
devote'" time p and attention to the matter.
To the masculine mind this is a woman's
idea of "enjoying" herself ; but a friend of
mine feelingly, says "to be a well-dressed
woman \ you must be a very industrious
one," and she voices my opinion.
Personally, I ' like very ' simple clothe?,
but, unfortunately, that is a taste which
has a more depleting effect upon our poor
little pocket-books ; than to bedeck our
selves with fuss and feathers and gew
gaws would have.
A simple eown to be effective must bear
the imprint of a {'master hand. It is very
gratifying to me to note that my costumes
in "An American Citizen" are so much
admired, for I planned them mostly my
self. V â  '.' "'.' ..'-'
I never wear anything unsuitable to me,
even though it be 'considered extremely
stylish..; A woman , who wishes to -be
thought well dressed must lir.-t find out
what is and what in not : . becoming "to her
and dress accordingly. 0." course it does
not follow that because one looks well in
white satin and swansdown it is neces
sary to wear them on all occasions.
Peculiarity in dress is never in good
taste, nor can a woman expect to ; ; bo
stylish who entirely ignores the prevailing
fashion. y /I- believe"; in following the; dic
tates of , fashion ,as nearly 'Â as /- possible
without sacrificing too much of one's own
individuality. ":. r lt is not necessary to look
like a French fashion-plate to be well
"dressed;'-f.j'f."V;;-'.^i.;" â¢' â â  'â '.-.
It has been asked of me more than once
what in my estimation is the most prac
tical bicycle suit. Ah! the bicycle! Tin
is a most interesting subject to talk about,
but my idea of the dress to* wear * will be,
I think, both uninteresting and unim
portant, but nevertheless, in my opinion,
the first requisite is to be "comfy," isn't" it?
I_-______M_-________-Â».â m â  i'M.iii-'iiiiâ H-l nil-ffi-_..fl r mi I" iir
Persona _y,-!-much prefer the divided
skirt, fairly short, with bloomersâ
wordâ of India silk beneath. They are
very light, of course, and that is something
to be considered these warm days. I have
often heard people express a dislike for
the divided skirt because of a sort â well,
betrousered effect,, but that is obviated,
entirely if the skirt be perfectly cut.
/Talking of the Bicycle, we are all bicycle
mad, but my enthusiasm is tempered by
a wholesome respect for its capacity to hit
back. At present I am eligible for the
position of tattooed lady, and the more
proficient I become the more I seem to get
whacked â that is the only word that
expresses it, I assure you. Young en
thusiasm still burns within me, however,
and a bicycle tour is one of the joys in
prospective of our summer vacation.

ALLEKDER % MUST HANG.
San Jose's Doable .Murderer Must Suffer
for His Crimen.
. Harvey Allender, the double murderer
of San Jose, must hang. At least the
Slate Supreme Court will not entertain his
appeal for a new trial. Allender was for
merly deeply in love with an Italian girl
named -Walberga Feilner, but she dis
carded him for young blacksmith named
Vinanzt Crossetli. Allender followed the
couple about and was frequently heard to
make threats to kill both. On August 9
of last year he met tbe two on Third street
and springing from his bicycle he drew a
revolver and shot the girl, killing her in
stantly.' He fired another, shot into her
prostrate body. Urossetti was alio filled
by the same weapon. U';' "_"â ;;%" '%l\
At the trial the double murderer set up
the defense of insanity, out the jury found
him guilty of murder in the first degree
and the Judge's sentence was death by
hanging. : The ground for appeal was that
the Judge committed a mistake in in
structing the jury as to the law in two
particulars relating to the i prisoner's ; de
fense 'of insanity. The Supreme Court
held that no error had been committed by
the Santa Clara County Judge. The date
of the murderer's execution has not yet
been set. â ".*..

NO FEES FOR
COUNTY OFFICERS
The Supreme Court Punches
a Hole in a State
Law.
As to the Levy of a Property
Tax Upon All Estates
Except Prcbile.
In Its Opinion the Recent Legislative
Enactment Is Not Wholly
Constitutional. .*-
The Supreme Court has reversed the
decision of the Superior Court of Santa
Clara County in a writ of mandate pro
ceeding of Louis Fat jo and others against
I Henry A. Pfister, the County Clerk.
Plaintiffs are the executors of the will of
Mariano Malarin, deceased. In 1895 they
presented to tho County Clerk tho inven
tory and appraisement of the estate and
tendered $20 for fees. The value of the es
tate was $243,504 70, and the clerk de
manded $240, and refused to file the in
ventory and appraisement unless that
sum was paid. The executor.) petitioned |
the Santa Clara County Court lor a writ of H
mandate requiring the County Clerk to
file the same, and the prayer was denied.
From this judgment the appeal was taken.
The Supreme Court held that the only
question involved was. the constitutional
ity of the act of March 28, 1895, entitled
"An act to establish the fees of county,
town ship and other offices, etc." Section
1 of the act sets forth:
The lollowing county, township and other
officers shall charge and collect tne following
fees: County Clerkâ On the commencement of
any action or proceeding in the Superior Court,
except probate proceedings, or an appeal
thereto, to' be paid by the party commencing
such action or proceeding or taking such ap
peal, $5. On the filing of a petition tor letters
of administration, or testamentary, or guar
dianship, $3, -to.be paid by the petitioner;
provided, that at the time of. filing the in
ventory and appraisement in any such pro
ceeding there shall be an additional deposit
of $1 for each additional thousand dollars of
the appraised valuation ia excess of $3000.
â¢ The constitutionality of the act was as
sailed on various grounds, but the Su
preme Court took notice of only one or
two, and the court says: â¢
It is perfectly plain that the Legislature has
attempted, by that portion of section 1 above
quoted, to levy a property tax upon all estates
of decedents, infants and incompetents. The
ad valorem charge for filing the inventory is
in no sense a fee or compensation. for the ser
vices of the officer, whicu are the some as re
spects this matter in every estate, large or
small. To call it a lee is a transparent
evasion.- It is not merely an g inheritance
tax, as counsel would contend, for, in tne
first place, it applies not only to estates
of decedents, but aiso to the estates of minors
and incompetents under guardianship. As to
the estates' of decedents, it applies not to the
distributable residue after the payment of
| debts and expenses of administration, but to
the whole body of the estate, and would be
collectible, if the law were valid, from an In
i solvent estate as well as irom one of equal
appraised value and no liabilities. As an
attempt to levy a property tax, the act is in
this particular Invalid for several reasons.
Firstâ lt violates section 1 of article XIII of
the constitution in Impi sing an extraordinary
tax upon the property to which it applies in
addition to the equal 7 and uniform tax to
which- alone all property in thÂ« _t_re is liable.
Secondâ The subject of the act is not expressed
in its title and is in no way germane thereto;
a. violation .of section 24 'of ' article
IV of â  the " constitution, which '"requires
that every act shall embrace but one bubject,
which subject shall bo expressed in its title.
; Thirdâ l he act requires the tax for which lt
provides. to be paid into the county treasury
tor county purposes, and violates section 12 of
article XI of the constitution, which forbids
tbe Legislature to impose taxes for county
purposes. : :
Tne judgment of the Superior" Court is re
vert-ed and the cause remanded, with direc
tions to grant the peremptory writ of mandate
a's prayed -by the petitioners.
The opinion was written by Chief Jus
tice Beatty and concurred in by Justices
Temple, McFarland, Van Fleet, Harrison,
Henshaw and Garoutte.
Mrs. Dimoud Did Not Appear.
Mrs. Carey Higley Dimond, the Honolulu
divorcee, was to have appeared In Justice
Cook's court yesterday to answer an order of
examination procured by J. J. Raver, but sent
a physician's certificate by a messenger that
she was suffering. from nervous prostration
and could not attend. The matter was contin
ued until to-morrow. Raver got a Judgment
against Mrs. Dimond on a note for $250, but
failed to find 7 anything to satisfy the' claim
except a bicycle that realized $10. Now he
wants to know what has become of the dia
monds and other costly trinkets that Mrs.
Dimond possessed when she lauded in tnis

j-loW Whist Knowledge /-lust Be
Acquired.
We ate frequently asked, "How" can I ever
learn to play whist?" "How con I improve
my game?" etc., etc. There are several other
stereotyped questions that one frequently
hears in whist c Ã¼bs similar to the above.
We could fill volumes in trying to answer
them. It is a hard nut to crack. When you
come to sift it alt down, yon will find there ls
only one way or one road to travel to get to
the goal of a mediocre not to say a first-class
whist player. If you do not want to travel
this particular road, do not start out, for you |
wll! never get there. If we should ask Judge
Slack how one could become a lawyer, or usk j
Dr. McNutt how one could become a physician, |
or ask General A. W. Drayson how a man
could become an astronomer, they would all
no doubt give us the same answer. They
would advise us to begin at the beginning and
be a thorough student, and that we must
study hard.
In other words, it means that you must get a
certain amount of knowledge from an ex
perienced teacher or from the textbooks. It
may be foolish for us to say that some will ask
it there are any textbooks written on the
subject of whist. As the question will be
asked, we will anticipate it by saying there
are six or seven hundred different books on
the game. Don't let this scare the reader to
death; it is not necessary to buy but one of
them, at a total expense of six bits to a dollar.
Then, as we said before, begin at the begin
ning, learn the A BC of the game. ; ,
First come the proper leads and follows
from every combination of cards possible to
hold; then second and third hand ploy; then i
come tbe discard; finessing; the- call for
trumps; tne echo and subecho of the call; i
learn how to show number in partner's suit;
how to unblock. When you have acquired
this much knowledge of the game, then and
not until then should you sit down at a whist- !
table to attempt to play. And when that time I
comes se.ect for your partner some one who I
knows lully as much if not more than your- |
self. In bunting around for a partner, if you
find those that will tell you they "are good
whist-players," tbey "know all about the
game," drop them lfke a bot potato, or in other
words, don't take sucn a person for a partner.
They are no good as a rule and know nothing
of the game. Find one that Is satisfied In say
ing he "plays at It," or one that says he ls a
student. Whin you do find such a one freeze j
to him. Then climb up the hill together.
From the time you start in to play never for
get you are not playing alone- you have
formed a copartnershipâ and. always try at
least to combine your hand with your part
ner's. Play the two hands as one, lf possibleâ
your twenty-six cards against your adver
saries' twenty-six.
The greatest player and writer of his day,
the world-renowned Deschapelles, cays "a mu
tual understanding between partners forms
the very spirit of the game and the basis of
all improvement." This can only be done by
adopt! ng the same identical line or system of
play from A to Z and sticking to it. Your
original lead of ace, king, queen, jack, ten,
nine, or any card down to the: deuce, should
not have a dual meaningâ it should always
mean the same thing. If you willful.
deceive your partner . once confidence is
shaken; the second time you do so confidence
is lost. And whist confidence is just as sacred
as' any other kindâ always speak the truth by
the card you play. -When you are "second in
hand" player you should 'Conform in 99 cases
out of 100 to what the. textbooks tell you to
do. If you studied law or medicine the time
would naturally come when you "fouid be
admitted -to practice. Then ..id you,

It has never occurred in the history of the
game that the cards in two deals of whist
were ever dealt alike, conssquently they. can
never be played the same. We know several
professional men in our whist clubs of San
Francisco who fall to know all the proper
leads and follows, or the conventional second
hand play, who pride themselves in. saying
they never looked into a whist book in their
lives. Think of it! It they practice' their pro
fession as they play whist, "what \ horrible
mess they must make of it. This class of peo
ple, and they are numerous, stand in. their
own light. As long. as they entertain such
ideas they can never become even second-rate
players. One of the great faults of our team
play in the clubs of this City is that the, play
ers are not properly coached. They have no
head, and one will not yield to the other
each one is certain his way is the best Hav
ing no uniform system of play, no agreement
is ever reached. 01 course, all are anxious jto
win. but without realizing it, they ail pull in
opposite directions. A beautiful example to j
the whist world is Jhe great Albany team of i
Albany, N. Y.â the^team that mnde such a I
| wonderful record in the A. W. L. trophy con-
I tests during the past six months. They com
menced to gain their National reputation at
Philadelphia in 1894, again in Minneapolis in
1895, and came within one-half a trick of
j winning the A. W. L. trophy in 1896. They
1 have one head, or captain, and follow his ad- (
I vice Implicitly. In team work they play as a
I unit. In practice they are up to date aud try
alt new ideas, etc. We intend soon to publish
their entire system of play, with illustrated
deals taken from the great Albany-St." Paul
match played at the midwinter meeting of
these two teams at Detroit, Mich., when Albany
won one of the most interesting whist matches
ever played. ..-,'.C"

Spades trumps, North to lead.

the ace and returns the suit. East trumps the
trick. '" Two. questions \we would like to ask
you: - '. ." .â¢'."â¢ â "'..â '. '* :'-. -." ~ : '
I Firstâ Should , West, with this holding, call
for trumps? ,
Secondâ lf West does not call for trumps,
what should East lead at trick 3 ?
In answer to the question, Should West call
for trumps? we think lt would be good play
to do so," lor two reasons." The first is, West is
very strong ,", la': trumps . and; has ? one > good,'
strone, \ plain suit, % with ' more ] than aâ¢_ lair'
chance of ; making The other reason (and
with us it is a weighty one), if West did not
"call" East ] might ; come ' with a* losing? dia
mond,^ compelling West to trump. Because
West calls for trumps East Is not askca to lead
them more than . once,' unless he leads a win
ning card and holds the trick.
To the second question: "If West does not
call for tramps, what should Eait lead at trick
'." \As two ; full - rounds have been played,

We arc now and have been- for several years

Tormevj's 'Rotary Discard v Used ir\
Baltimore.
Mr. Beverly W. Smith of Baltimore writes
for,' the News of that city a very interesting
article: on the subject of the discaid. After
giving a general description of the usual sys
tem of discarding he calls his reader's atten

ing words: -; -. >
Another form or discard which is now receiving
much attention, particularly from local players,
Is that termed the rotary discard. For the pur
pose ot in Â«. Whiz this discard, the suits are arranged
in the. tollowlng relative order, viz; ? Spades,
hearts, clubs and diamonds.; After diamonds would
come spades -again, and - then hearts - and \ then
clubs, and so on. This arrangement, which gives
name to the discard, should always be borne In
mind, and the player wishing to designate his suit
by his original discard throws a card from the suit
immediately preceding the suit intended to be in
dicated,' the' trump ; suit being always | e.lmtnated ;
In | the j calculation. â  Thus," hearts J being ; trumps,
the discard of a club would show diamonds the

necessity of following ] Its exact and literal .de

THE BENCH SHOW
WAS A SUCCESS
The San Francisco Kennel
. Club Will Put Away
Some Money.
A Large Crowd Witnessed the
Going Home of the
Dogs.
The Judges Will Leave for Their
Eastern _ Homes on
Monday.
The judges of the dog show, who fin
ished their task of handing ribbons to the
owners of prize dogs yesterday, will now
get ready to take their departure for their
respective homes in the East. , VC*.
The attendance yesterday and last even
ing was very large, and among the many
who witnessed the final awards were sev
eral members of San Francisco's four
hundred.
H. T. Payne's kennel of prize-winners
attracted large crowds during the day and
evening. The little "flogs which wer6
benched on the south side of the Pavilion
were greatly, admired by the ladies. -^ .. _>
The performing dogs amused the ladies
and children, who watched with interest
the different tricks they performed in the
ring. As the time for the closing of the
show drew near owners of dogs were here,
there and everywhere, and as the big and
little canines were led from their respec
tive Kennels to tbe street by the men who
were engaged to look out for tbe interest
of the dogs the growling and barking of
the canines that weie anxious to end the
show in a free-for-all fight could have been
heard for blocks. , '.',-.
The officers of the San Francisco Ken
nel Club state tbat the show was a suc
cess financially as well as otherwise.
They did not clear very much money on
the venture, but they, expect to realize a
nice little sum, though they cannot say
how much it will be until the accounts are
settled.
It must be admitted by all sportsmen
that the initial show of the new club was
splendidly conducted and the arrange
ments perfect in every detail. The own
ers of the prize-winners are delighted witn
the handsome prizes that were given by
members of the club. All in all the bench
show was a great success and the club can
feel justly proud of its inaugural attempt
at bench showing. The following prizes
were awarded yesterday: ..â â ..â

Trist Duplicate Whist Club J.ecep
tion.
We . have received a handsomely engraved
'invitation from the Trist < Duplicate Whist
Club, presenting its compliments and request
ing our company Saturday evening, May 29,
at . o'clock sharp. Duplicate whist will be
the amusement. Several nice prizes will be
j awarded and refreshments served. The deep
and growing interest in the game of whist Is
spreading so that the lady or gentleman that
does not know how to play the game has
neglected a part of her or his education. It is
an accomplishment second to none. . ... ; .â 'â 
Jhe Lead From /\ce and Four
Small.
In another part of this article we are asked
our opinion in regard to a lead from a certain
holding. -Since answering this question we
have received a copy of the . Field of London.
The "Cavendish," is its whist
editor. On this subject he says; / . **
! ] The lead of ace from ace and ' small with great
numerical strength is a casein point, and although
it has nothing to do : with sequence leads it de
. mands \ examination. The conditions are exceed
ingly complicated. It is not necessary to enter
Into them here, as Mr. Whitteld has already
; treated them exhaustively. Ho finds that, as a
; mere matter of trick-making, there Is a slight ad
| vantage in the lead of a small card ,' from J ace. and
four small ones; but this is nearly compensated. for
by the chance of the ace being subsequently ruffed
if a small card Is led and . by other Indirect consid
erations. The j probability â of subsequent ruffing
appears tome to be the objection to .the lead of a
small card mainly present to the minds \of those
who lead ace, for a small card is unhesitatingly led
in trumps and also in plain suits after th* adverse
trumps bave been extracted.' ;'" - 'â **,â¢â  'â *-/
' On â  the whole.' having ' considered tbe case with
some cere, l prefer the lead of ace, from ace and
lour small; In j plain suits, at the English straight
game of short whist, tive up, counting honors, ex
cept when just strong enough in trumps and other
suits to refrain from leading's trump nntli it is
known whether partner can belp in the five-card
ace suit:-.--. .."..,.'-.-:..â¢â¢--â¢ ;-,*-â¢; â¢-">!.â ;:./;â  ;...'."'â¢*./..'..'.'
At duplicate:, whist, where honors do not count,
and every hand is played out to [ the end for what
it is worth, the conditions are ( somewhat different,
and I am ' inclined to the lead of ( fourth best, with
live of the suit exactly, but not wl.h more than
five. I must confess, j however, j that 1 I have | not
played duplicate often enough to make any opin
ion of much value. It will probably be found, I
" think, ' mat ?at | duplicate , there \ls . not I much to
choose between*- ono lead or the other. The ad
vantage of i showing a minimum , of | five by. the
orizinai | lead { has j not, in J my opinion, been j sutn
c nitty considered in regard to the duplicate game.
No doubt a solution, or, at all events, an approxi
mate solution will be worked out in. tbe course of
time. V ._-...' , . " *.-â 'â  'â â â â 'â â  '--â '':'.

The Greeks live to fight another day.
The Turks won, but they can't gobble.
Cuba has seen stars for a long time, but

Going to the dogs is not so bad when
they are well-bred dogs and have style

To-day we take it easy, but to-morrow
the tariff debate begins and we may have
to take it bard.
Those who subscribed to th? Balboa
avenue fund have an interest in it that
will be rermanent.
McKinley is not **o eager to recognize
the belligerency of Cuba as to see her liv

As the dog show is over the attention of
society is called to the fact that there is
an art exhibition in town that is worth
seeing.
The Greeks are not far wrong in laying
the blame of their overthrow on their
commanders; it seems to have been a gen
eral thing.
If you are a progressive cit : zen and do
not co-operate with the Merchants' Asso

right way.
The fight for Western interests in the
new tariff must be made by the whole
West, the mighty West and the West
altogether.

The best sione in the world for the new

If the Senators stick to that proposed

than a tempest in a teapot to confront
when they return home to meet their con

The past week brought the war in
Greece to a close, and furnished evidences
that the struggle in Cuba is approaching
the end, so we may account it a good
week for the world.
The entire California delegation should
act energetically to bring about speedy
work on San Pedro harbor. Continuous
agitation will be required to get it started
and keep it moving.
It is asserted the British Government
intends to be quiet in the European con

jubilee in peace, and will then rise up and
talk out in meeting in a way that will
astonish folks. '.;-.'-â -. ,v ; :
The decision of the University of Cam
bridge not to allow women to take degrees
shows how hard it is for a medieval insti

keep up with * the procession. In the

along advancing, and before a great while
Cambridge will be almost lost from sight
by the vanguard of progress.
An expert declares there-are. known to
the barbers of this country seven styles of
utting hair: square, elite, senator, pom
padour, Saratoga, Mont Bianc and New
port. The average barber, however, ex
ercises no discretion in cutting the hair
â  o suit the man, and not infrequently puts
a senator where there should be a pom
padour, and shapes a Saratoga curl on a
Mont Blanc cranium.
A Massachusetts Judge has decided that
a building devoted to the use of a theo
sopbical society doesn't come within the
scope of â  the btate law exempting from
taxation property used for religious pur
poses. It folows from this that in
Massachusetts theosophy is not a reli
gion, and we would now like to have a
decision from a court as to what is re
quired to constitute a religion in that
commonwealth.
The Call can justly congratulate its
r*-a_-ers this morning on the excellence of
the teports which its news service enabled
it to give of the events in the Levant ever
since the outbreak in Crete. Our reports
were not made up of fakes published one
day and contradicted on tne next, nor
were they composed of week-old stories
printed as telegrams from the seat of war,
and marked '-delayed in transmission."
We cave every day the right news, the
full news; and it was always up to date.
The chief of the Consular Bureau of the
State De partment, who has just returned
from a tour of .inspection* around the
world, says no consular system is better
than ours and that European officials ad*
mit the superiority, of our service. He
adds, however, there are a few barnacles
in office that ought to be removed, so the
chances are that some enterprising gentle
men now out of a job may get' a place in
this excellent service and have the satis
faction .of knowing tnat . their i ptesence

TWO KINDS OP NEWS.
Oar able New. York collaborator, the
Sun, two weeks ago devoted three columns
of its space to nu expose of the "padding
cell" in the cffice of the Chicago Asso
ciated Press.; It asserteoand proven that
the aliened cablegrams which that insti
tution had been furnishing to its patrons
as news . fresh from the seats of : war. in
Europe had not been the work of special
correspondents in Macedonia, at Milouna
Pass, in Larissa, Athens or Constantino
pie, but had been evolved by an extremely
versatile and phenomenally Ã¼biquitous
individual in London, and by one other
genius of equal parts in New York.
The London agent had been sending a
"skeleton" of news daily to the New York
agent, by whom it bad been diligently
padded and made fat and thus trans
mitted to the Associated Press "news"
papers Tinder various heads and dates. "-"
' Many papers thus mongrelly stocked
have reared (in their imagination) a choice
litter of war correspondents about them,
and have conferred upon them the dis
tinction of having their "dispatches"
copyrighted by the managing editor.
As the war between Turkey and Greece
nears its end, The Call feels that the time
is at hand when a brief review of its news
treatment of the situation, as compared
with the queer handling thereof by the
patrons of the Associated Press, may be
interesting. It has been noted ail over the
country tbat The Call's daily dispatches
and pictures bearing upon the war have
been straightforward, bona-iide news on
the one hand, and accurate portrayals of
scenes and topography on the other.
Particular attention in the East, from
papers of the Harper's Weekly class, has
been paid to The Call's faithful accom
paniment of the telegraphic news with
pictures illustrating the features thereof
as the scenes have shifted from day to day.
These pictures have been not merely
chance cuts or copies or old plates
dragged from dusty shelves, but authen
tic reproductions of the actual places and
incidents on the day following from cer
tain exclusive resources not enjoyed by
other San Francisco papers, and assisted
by a familiarity with the southern part of
Europe which our contemporaries evi
dently do not share.
For example, The Call published the
first picture of the battle in Milouna Pass,
the first picture of Phar_tala and its cita
del, the first picture of Volo and its har
bor, and other exclusive views, - together
with a series of maps minutely detailing
the locations, marches, maneuvers and
battle preparations of the respective
armies as they pursued their ways. No
service in the United States excelled The
Call's for reliability and promptness, and
very few, if any, equaled it.
Mark the contrast between this service
' from a real newspaper and the service
furnished by the Examiner with its "copy
righted" cablegrams from ' the Assoc ated
Press' padding cell in New York and its
news agent in London that amazing en
gine of Ã¼biquity, who had his headquar
ters in Pharsala and his hindquarters
in London. Many of the "special" dis
patches from Pharsala or Athens, which
the Examiner published one day, were re
hashed and redated and published the
next day under the head of "Delayed in
Transmission," from another part of Eu
rope altogether! In some cases whole
sentences were copied bodily from one
day's "dispatches" into those of the next
day. On May 7 the mismanaging editor
forgot to change the tenses of the article
which he rehashed from May G, with the
result that the battle fought on the sth
inst. was referred to as having occurred
on the _.h !
This is how the Examiner has been fak
ing news and deluding its readers while
The Call has been doing its plain duty as
a newspaper. All the people of San Fran
cisco are not going to be fooled all the
time by such dishonorable and contempti
ble subterfuges as this monarch of fakers
has been practicing upon them under
cover of the tin pan which it has been
brazenly beating the while in its own
praise.
INSTITUTIONAL OfIUEOHES.
The New York Voice contains a long
and very interesting account of the insti
tutional churches of the metropolis, and
he story, of tbeir activities and their suc
cess is one well worth examination by all
who are interested in organized efforts to
improve the conditions of life anions
those who have not the privileges and op
portunities of wealth.
The methods of the institutional
churches nave met and disarmed the
charge of clerical neglect of popular needs,
and their bettering influences and help
in distress are welcomed by a large
class of people who are either hos
tile or indifferent to churches gener
ally. They are meeting indeed with so
much favor from the masses that Dr.
Scudder of the People's Palace Institu
tional Church says he would no more
change to the old style than go back to
traveling on canal-boats.
In giving a definition of an institutional
church Dr. Scudder says. "This type oi
church is sociological rather than theo
logical." The description, however, is
not to be construed as implying that all
the effort is devoted to supplying means
for the improvement of this present life,
for in addition to its practical he 1 }, the
new church keeps up a constant work to
impress the spiritual influences of re
ligion upon the multitude.
One of the largest of these churches in
New York is the Judson Memorial, which
does a great amount of work among the
people at an annual expense of about
$30,000. It devotes itself to the neglected
classesâ to tnose wbo will not enter the
fold of the regular churches, and who, but
for these institutions, would not have the
benefits of religious gathering and asso
ciation at all.
The beginning of the attractions of this
church is a clear fountain of cool water in
the porch, constantly flowing and free to
all. The doors of tbe building are always
open and visitors are always welcome.
One portion of the church is a big apart
ment-house and family hotel* and the in
come derived from this is a partial feeder
for the philanthropic, work of the main
enterprise. Besides , the. large auditory
there is a hall, a gymnasium and apart
ments and offices for carrying on the
widely varied work. The church cost
$.50,000. It was founded by the efforts of
a son of the famous missionary, Adoni
ram Judson.
/Another one of the prominent institu
tional churches i 3 tne "People's Palace,"
which last year fed, cared for and taught
10-1 poor children and furnished 12,227
baths free to the needy. ;'*>
The field of usefulness of these churches
covers enough to make a long story. Part
of the work.of a practical nature is as fol
lows: A medical dispen*ary with both
men. and women physicians, working for
a nominal charge, or [none, according to
the needs of the sick ; a free kindergarten
for poor children, giving instruction both
mental and moral ; .'organized â  charity to
give intelligent relief to the needy ; a home
for children; a gymnasium and ' bath for
both sexes; a manual training-school for
girls; ; a' cottage jat ; Green 1 ! Mountain for
summer outings for children, sick persons

and overworked shop girls; a people's la
bor bureau ; healthful and innocent amuse
ments, and lectures and : literary enter
tainments. Some of them even furnish
theatrical entertainments * under church
auspices, to be sure that no evil influence
creeps into them. S , 'r ; s-- X r-
It is scarcely necessary to add that this
programme attracts multitudes who other
wise would not enter a church, arid thus
becomes a means of conversion from evil
ways aud associations. Tbe plan has ad
vantages'of a purely religious as well as
of a philanthropic nature, and as a sup
plement to the methods of the more -con
servative congregations, the institutional
churches have proven themselves benefi
cial to the moral s as well as the material
welfare of the community.
CHANGING CHINA.
The news that a number of new railways
are about to be constructed in China, and
among them one connecting Woosung
with Shanghai, recalls the amusing but
woeful fate of the Woosung railway built
a score of years ago as an experiment in
China. Its life was only six weeks long.
Chinese conservatism at that time could
not stand the innovation, and the alien
thing invented by "foreign devils" was
torn up and all the material of it carried
out of the country. The change that has
been wrought in Chinese thought in the
score of years between the first railway
venture at Woosung and tbe one now
planned to be built there is very suggest
ive of what a few more years of contact
with Western civilization may do for
China now that the way is fairly to be
opened up.
The new railway connecting Shanghai
with Woosung and Soochow and Chin
kiang is to be 200 miles long, and at the
same time there.. is to be constructed
another line extending from Peking 900
miles to Shankaikwan. The enterprising
capitalist who is going to construct these
roads is Sheng Ta Jen, a man of so much
wealth and power in China that in some
ways he is said to be a successful rival of
the great Li Hung Chang.
Besides the ventures of this Chinese
Vanderbilt, there are several branch lines
of railway being constructed in Southern
China. These with the great transconti
nental road that the Russians are to make
through Manchuria will inaugurate a new
era for the Chinese and may materially
affect the commerce of the world. .";*;
It is just nine years since Li Hang
Chang took his first ride on a Chinese rail
way, a little road at Tientsin, eighty-one
miles long and with a gauge of 3 feet 6
inches, and already these great undertak
ings are in progress. The contrast which
the coming network of railways will make
in commerce and government between old
and new China will be a wide one. It is
not long since Chinese armies, when on
the way to attack frontier enemies, would
halt half way in order to plant and har
vest a crop to supply their commissary on
the way, and Chinese officials sen*-, to sta
tions 800 miles from the capital would
spend three months on the route.
There is little doubt that these improve
ments will be a great awakening to the
Chinese, but it is not so certain tbat the
opening ud to commerce and industry of
such a numerous and economical popula
tion will have a good effect on Western
Industries. Added to her exceedingly
cheap labor China has immense beds of
fine coal that will be easily available as
soon as railways are built, and these ad
vantages may make Chinese aangerous
rivals in many branches of manufacture.
JINGO SENTIMENT.
The speech of Senator Mason on the
Cuban question will take rank with the
most eloquent which have been delivered
in the Senate on tbat subject since the
present crisis began, and in no portion
was it more effectual than in the reply
made to the charge of Senator Wellington
that those who advocated the independ
ence of Cuba are mere jingoes. On this
issue Senator Mason said:
When you get at the deeD undertone of the
conscience of ; the Christian people of this
country they say let us have freedom in Cuba.
They say let the Spaniard go back to his own
land and let us have no slaves upon our con-'
tinent. * You can call that jingo as long as you
like. You may define jingo as long as you
please. Patrick Henry was a jingoist accord
ing to the definition of the gentlemen who
are trying to keep down the insurgents in
Cuba. Every man who had rather fight than
to buy peace at the dishonor of his wife or bis
child has been called a jingo from the days of
early republics until now.
' There can be no question that the elo
quent young Senator from Illinois ex
pressed the prevailing sentiment of the
people of this country in regard to the
situation in Cuba. Our people under
stand that there are many reasons of busi
ness and commercial interests for our
interference to put an end to the war, but
it is not for these they most strongly de
sire to see the conflict closed.
Americans wish the independence of
Cubs because they sympathize with every
people striving for liberty and fighting
for it against desperate odds. â¢â - They love
liberty and earnestly speak for it, and it
is because of this they are denounced as
jingoes.* If they would dismiss from the
discussion these nobler issues and talk
only of the benefits to trade to be derived
from a restoration of peace, Senator Wel
lington arid those who think . like him
would be mere willing to listen to them
and readier to vote with tnem. - -
PEACE IN SIGHT.
The news of the past week concerning
the affairs of both Cuba and Greece has
been reassuring. The outlook to-day for
the people of these much-stricken lands is
decidedly better than it was a week ago.
The words spoken in Congress by those
who may be fairly assumed to represent"
the administration confirm the hope of
the people-that our Government will see
its way clear to advance peace and inde
pendence in Cuba,' while all reports from
Europe show that the powers will inter
vene, by force if necessary, to save Greece
from the wrath of her victorious foe. ~ , 0*1"
The close of the long struggle in Cuba
and the cessation of hostilities in the Le
vant would under, any. circumstances be
of great advantage to the" slowly reviving
industries and : commerce of the f world.
We may expect therefore benefits: of no
inconsiderable * nature to flow f rom j the
assurance given of peace under terms that
will enable Greece to recover her normal
prosperity -in a â¢ short time and relieve
Cuba forever from the foreign yoke which
has' stifled her enterprise and prevented
the '[ expansion -'â  of the ' energies of -, her
people.
The intervention which seems probable
in Europe and which we may make in the
case of Cuba is a new development in the
international relations of \ the world. .*. In,
each case the intervention is proposed for
the sake of peace and: for 1 the purpose of
preventing the subjugation of a compara
tively weak people by a stronger one. 1
This is so unprecedented that many, con
servatives declare it ito) be a - violation of
the fundamental principles of * interna
tional law. It jisl clearly an' outcome of
recent conditions among civilized nations
and is to be justified not by an appeal to
history, but ( by 'â  reasons = drawn | from the
I demands of the. present and what : the
future will need. . Â 'Â". . ; ,
The aid given by France to the Ameri
can colonies in their war against England
was very. different in intention from that
which is to \be offered now both by the
concert in Europe and by Congress in the
case of Cuba. The design of the Govern
ment of King Louis was \ not to promote
peace, but to make the war disastrous to
Great Britain. - In the present eas* we de
sire no disaster to Spain, and Europe has
given ample proof that- the concert aims
at no disaster to : Turkey. We have
reached a higher international law than
was known to our ancestors, and if the
good prospects of peace with which the
week begins are realized we shall have ac
complished in both the Old World and the
New something of -which this generation
of statesmen may well be proud;

THE RIFLE OF THE FUTURE
What will be the rifle that will eventually
displace the weapons now ln the hands of the
armies of the world? General WiUe. a Ger
man officer, and an authority holding ad
vanced views on all questions relating to
armaments believes that the future rifle will
be of the automatic type, such as the present-
Maxim and Mann licher. Although this type
of arm -gives 'a' greater rapidity of fire than
the present magazine rifle, this is not its chief
value, which lies rather in relieving the sol
dier of physical and mental exertion. The
present rifle gives a sufficient rapidity of fire,
and any improve nfent in that direction would
be rather a disadvantage than otherwise, as
in tho hands of any but the most highly dis
ciplined troops great waste of ammunition
would be sure to result and the supply might
be endangered. .. _V- - ''\- :^
In. the automatic rifle part of the gas pres
sure of each shot is stored up and the piece
opens the chamber, ejects the fired shell and
closes the chamber. It ;. thus automatically
performs all of the operations except filling
the* magazine' and aiming, even keeping on
working after the ammunication is exhausted.
- Up to the present automatic rifles are of four
distinct type* - or systems. First,; the barrel
moves backward; second, fixed barrel; third,
fixed barrel with parallel tube for storing gas
connected near the muzzle; fourth, the barrel
moving forward. "
Needless to say, such weapons are triumphs
of mechanical skill. Borchardt's repeating
pistol of the automatic type is now being thor
oughly tested in the Austrian army and by the
Vienna Rifle Club. â  The stock .is at right an
gles to the barrel. Each shot is fired sepa
rately, the other operations , being performed
automatically. The magazine is in the stock
and hoios eight cartridges. : >.
These pistols have many advantages over
the ordinary revolver, giving less recoil and
therefore greater accuracy 'â  in aiming. - Re
charging - is performed jby simply, adding a
packet of cartridges. : The objections 5 are
liability to -accidental discharge, as simple
pressure on the trigger is all that is required;
waste of ; ammunition and complication with
consequent liability to get out of order. â ;';'.
The immense efforts put forth by the French
since the war of 1870 have resulted in the
creation of a superb army, with an organiza
tion and equipment well, nigh perfect. The
result: Army list) give the number of officers
in * actual service in V. the French s army as
28,9.5 ; in the reserve and territorial army as
30,005, or .'a grand ; total â¢of \ 03,030 * officers
available In case of mobilization. Of this
total some are designed for command iv the
field, while others will take care of the vari
ous auxiliary services in France, such as rail
roads,' depots, etc. â  '; :

BASEBALL IN MINIAIURE
BascDall. enthusiasts are very much inter
ested iin a â  new invention for reproducing in
miniature a ball game played at any distance
away. Of course electricity Is the agent that
accomplishes this. *v,- The miniature diamond is
erected on a stage in a pub.ic hall, and as the
spectators enter they behold; a platform 1 slop
ing to trio stage at a good angle, so that every
player civ': be ; seen -at any. portion of the
house. â ' The platform is- painted green, to
represent the grass, and the base plates are
marked \ out. * The \ grounds are inclosed by
fences, and in the center field is a large score
board on which appear the scores of the games
in other cities, which are posted by innings.
So well has the system been developed that
a scorer sitting in Boston can note every play
of a game in Cleveland and reproduce the
story of the game so that it will compare ex-
ELECTRIC AUTOMATIC BASEBALL.
actly with a story written by one who has
actually seen the game. In miniature base
ball every ball, every strike, every, foul, every
hit, and every fielding play is given, and given
by signals in such a manner that the spectator
can understand without a word of explanation
from the operator. Ground balls are indicated
by white electric litthts in front of each player,
11 gathered by an infield a white light, repre
senting: the ball, immediately afterward ap
pears in the bauds of the infield, and . then if
the ball appears in the hands of a baseman
ahead of the runner, the man is out. If the
ball if fumbled, a red light appears at tbe feet
of the fielder, and incase of the catcher this
means a passed ball. If the light flickers in
the hands of tne fielder, a fumble is indicated,
and the red and white light together Indicate
a wild throw. ; Fly balls, fair or foul, are
shown by white or green lights suspended in
the air, followed by a white light in the hands
of either in or outfielder, as the case may be.
- The whole scheme is controlled by an ope
rator who works on a switchboard controlling
147 wires. There are thirty-two signals for
the base-runners.; The puppets move their
legs by a system of cog-wheels while in mo
tion. The coaches are put in a state of vio
lent agitation by. means of cords. A great
deal of fun- for the spectators is caused by the
way the base-runners take a lead from the
base in response to the urging of the coaches.
As each man goes to the bat he takes a right
handed or a left-handed position, as the case
maybe. In miniature ball each man carries
bis own bat with him all the lime, this being
a departure from what is seen in the regular
game. It works all right in the theater, bow
ever.
In Iront of the platform on which the dia
mond is seen is a box with four compartments.
One shows the strikes, another the balls and
the other two the runs scored, provision being
made for â  the scoring of nine runs in any
inning. All this is controlled by electricity.
The batting order appears on two large
blackboards on tne right and left of the
proscenium, and by means of an electric light
next to the name 01 the busman one can al
ways tell who is at bat. In fact, a spectator
entering the theater at any time of the
afternoon can .t ell the score, the innings
played, the number of men out and the man
batting. . . Â-...-
A LEAF FROM HISTORY.
New* York Sun.
Seventy years ago Greece had a far more ter
rible baptism of fire than sne is experiencing
now, and her independence was plucked from
a most desperate situation. It was, in fact,
the result of the arrogance of the Turks after
they had overrun all Greece and. captured
Athens. The Greek war; for freedom broke
out in 1321, and in the Peloponnesus the in
surgents were so successful that independ
ence was declared in the following year. In
strong contrast with the strategy of the pres
ent struggle, the Greek fleets of that day, com
manded by Canaris and Mianlis, destroyed
many Turkish ships In vengeance for disas
ters sustained at sea the Turks massacred the
inhabitants of the islands of Chios, Kasos and
Psara. A fear that the Turks would destroy
the towns captured during the last month and
bombard their inhabitants has doubtless re
strained the Greek fleet during. this war. In
1824 the Sultan called the Egyptians to his
aid, and the Greeks were soon reduced to ex
tremities.; , .
Far more thrilling . and terrible were the
events of that period, when Georgakas, penned
In a monastery, blew up the j building, killing
himself and followers, but a thousand Turks
as well. There was no pretense then of Turk
ish forbearance. The Greek patriarch at Con
stantinople was hanged at the gate of his
palace, with an Easter lily in bis hand, and
Christian families were slaughtered in every
quarter of the city. On tne island of Psara
occurred the blowing up of the monastery of
St. Nikaloas. The gates were opened by "the
thousand starving men and women, and when
.00*0 Moslems had swarmed in besiegers and
besleeed alike were killed by the explosion of
the mine that had been laid.
1 At Missolonghl women dressed ns men, with
children strapped on their Wicks, joined a
band of 1800 and | cut their way through the
Turkish army investing the place, '-leaving
5000 dead behind. But. the most devoted
heroism failed to turn the tide of defeat, and
Athens, with the Acropolis, which was the last
to fall, passed into the possession of the Turk
ish army.
It wasat this point that the Sultan's haughty
pride in bis complete conquest yielded to
Greece indirectly what she had failed to secure
by every conceivable self-sacrifice. The powers
of Europe had not been entirely indifferent to
the sufferings ot Greece, and the English
people especially were stirred by indignation.:
In July, 1827, a protocol was signed "at. Lon
don by Russia and France, i in which it was
agreed that II the Turkish Government, within
a month, did not consent to a truce, the three
powers would recognize the Independence of
Greece. . Turkey was In no humor to concede
'.hat it was not invincible, and the Turkish
fleet ventured to fire on the ships of the pow
ers. In the ensuing general battle in the bay
of Navarlno the allied fleets completely wiped
out the Turks, who lost in that memorable sea
fight not less than 6000 men. -Modern Greece
dates from that October day in 1827. -I -

MILLARD'S WESTERN TALES.
A PRETTY BANDITâ By F. R Millard. New
York: The Kskdale Press. For sale la this City
hi all bookstores.
Mr. Millard has in this book of tales done
very badly by the criticsâ he has given them
scarcely anything to criticize. Having on many
an occasion in the past professed himself a
critic over the newly made grave of a luckless
-wight that bad died in the service of making
him one, he should fully understand what a
critic likes best and how an author might
serve him most effectively. If he will go off
and be an author let him take his fate in his
own hands and become the same io us that
other authors have been to him. To be an
author of any other kind is extremely incon
siderate of him.
"A Pretty Bandit" bears evidence in every
psge that it was not written for the critics at
all, which, as a mere circumstance divested of
any ulterior significance, is about as amazing
a characteristic as any modern piece of fiction
coula display. Nearly all of our latter-day
novels and the majority of our latter-day
short stories that are intended for book publi
cation are written primarily for review.
Overlooking the fact that reviewing in
Itself is neither essential nor import
ant to the simple scheme of putting a
story between covers and sending it out for
the public to read, this modern fraternity of
author, publisher and critic who rule the ua
literary realm of letters make a triangular
game of it and are wholly taken up in each
otner's movements. The public is represented
in their calculations by only a financial con
sideration, furnishing which it is permitted to
go its way unsought, unhonored and unhung
âfor which small mercy it doubtless is thank
ful.
Mr. Millard's different kind of authorship
carries him away from the fraternal trio and
straight to the public. His stories are written
wholly and solely for the general people to
read. There isn't the faintest appeal to a re
viewer tn one of themâ at least, none which
Mr. Millard was conscious of when he wrote
it. In this respect the tales are not unlike a
newspaper, and Mr. Millard's splendid train
ing as a newspaper writer may have been re
sponsible for the similarity.
A newspaper is written 10 be readâ not to be
criticized. In a finer sense that describes Mr.
Millard's stories. There is no striving after
effect, no bidding for particular attention to
his styleâ theie is only plain, simple narrative.
This leaves the creations of his imagination
to be viewed alone. And the creations
themselves give the work whatever, sta
bility it possesses. The vehicle of expres
sion is level, the things expressed rise above it
like bowlders on a plain. And as to the quality
of the bowlders well, to come straight to the
point, they are far better than nine-tenths of
the bowlders that we find amid the tali grasses
and waving flowers of an overpolished style, j
Some kinds of writing rightly depend mainly >
upon style. Story writing is not one of these '
kinds. Mr. Millard has impaled this truth I
with a firm pen, and has let no fancy gran
grow under his hand in working out his
purpose.
It must not be assumed that the "Pretty Ban
dit" tales are inadequately expressed. The
least that may be said of Mr. Millard by one
who appreciates him altogether is that he is
natural. a writer of good English. But that
is left to be affirmed mostly by those who find
themselves at a loss to describe him to any
greater extent or variety, and the others some
times forget when it has been left unsaid.
Certainly In the present instance it goes with
out the saying.
If these rugged little tales to the public had
been written to me as a reviewer or a critic I
should proceed to prick with a sharp pen such
small detects as the sentences here following,
ana at the same time mayhap should lose the
wbolesomeness of the creations and see only
the tops of the bowlders through the screening
grasses:
When finally Metie came to leave Last Hope she
felt really sorry about going, for some reason or
other. /â¢â '" . 'z-~~:'-
Something glided through the brush and she
nearly screamed, for she thought lt was a moun
tain lion.
He made a blundering offer of assistance, which
Â£he, of course, couldn't think, of accepting.
From a conventionally critical point of view, ;
leaving aside the character of the whole work,
those tnree sentences would be considered
weak. Indeed, the extreme ingenuousness of
them borders upon amateurish story-telling
or primer-narrative phraseology. In the sec
ond one, for example, aside from the super
fluity of explaining what the girl thought
(the motive of her terror being obvious), it is
suggested that if she had thought the gliding
thing anything else than a mountain lion she
would not have "nearly screamed." The
thought of a gliding bear or wolf would not
have disturbed her in the least. Tne two other
quoted bits might be dissected in the same way,
and yet a few others might be dragged out of
the traiauil whole and made to look badly
alone under a microscope. But as threads in
the general groundwork of these tales, simple
in expression and broad in material as they
are, a few little overkeyed accentuations of
the one do not mar. but rather add to the har
mony of the whole. Certainly they serve
gently to impress upon you the characteristic
charm of the one, while the abiding charm of
the other prevents them from upsetting any
general effect. 1 -
Mr. . Millard's stories are more nearly West
ern literature than anything else that has ap
peared in California *fjince Bret Harte wrote
here. And they compare with the average
short story that is not western, but very much
eastern, as a woodcut engraving compares
with a half-tone plate.

STORIES OF THE RUSSIAN JEW.
IN THE PALEâ By Henry Illowlzl. Philadel
phia: The Jewish Pub.icatlon Society of Amer
- l< a.
Much of the modern literature about the
Jewish people sheds a very clear light upon
the problem of this race's apparently mysteri
ous survival. Dispersed, oppressed, repressed
aud heap.a with contumely, the irrepressible
Jew yet encompasses the earth and maintains
his individual and racial identity under odds
before which he might be expected to suc
cumb. What is the secret of this marvelous
vitality; this buoyancy under pressure; this
apparent tendency to thrive where another
race would long since have disappeared from
the face of the earth? The question is an in
teresting one. and it would seem as thougn a
partial answer to it is to be found in the
character of the Jew as at is revealed in â¢ the
stories of him, most of them by Jewish writers
that hive recently seen the light.
They present to us not the type under which
we have so long classified the Hebrew. They
show us not Fagin, nor Shyiock. but a many
sided beingâ cautious because of need, subser
vient oftentimes â¢by reason of oppression,
canny and wise in, the world's ways, yet un
der all his suffering and wrongs buoyant, rich
in expedient, hopeful and light-hearted, with'
a quickness of imagination and a certain sav
ing sense of humor that brings him through
much beneath which a man of different make-"
up would sink. The pure blood of the Jew has
retained, mrough long ages and amid varying
conditions, the Oriental inheritance of endur- !
ance and lightheadedness, of kindly youth
that makes even evil, conditions endurable
and causes hope to spring eternal in the
breast, for their cheering and upbearing. "'â *-;â¢â¢.
This quality of the race is admirably shown
in the volume of tales of the Russian Jew
that has just been issued by the Jewish Pub
lication Society. There are stories of fact
and folklore, the legends and myths that
have come down through generations of
Russc-Judeau students and story-tellers.
Many of them are full of the same whimsical,
opulent, extravagances that characterize the
ancient Mogul stories and tales of the East.
Some are full of tragedy, and others deal with
the witty inventions whereby the Jewish
student manages to make life endurable and
to wheedle subsistence out of a irowning
world. Now and then the stories are sad, but
through them all runs the vein of loyalty to
faith and race, of charity toward others and
of belief in the ultimate glory of his nation
that characterizes the Jew in every age and
clime. The Hebrew is essentially an optimist,
and by that same token a worker; and these
stories of the Russian Jew, which the Rus
sian, lliowlzi, has collected, give us a far
different idea of. the type than is to be gath
ered from studying the immigrant as seen at
Castle Garden.
CHARLES EDWIN MARKHAM.
The following sketch of a well-known Cali
fornia figure appears in the current issue of
the Book Buyer (Charles Scribner's Sons) : Few
among contemporarary jrriters of verse for
magazines have so clearly proved their right
to a place among the true lyric poets as Charles
Edwin* Markbam. He has the very rare
but much sought capacity for interpreting na
ture in a convincing wav â of giving voice to
her more subtile moods. This is only possible
to one who has lived near her and been under
her profound influence apart from the dis
tractions of the crowd.
Mr. Markham's early days were spent on a
lonely lanch in California, surrounded by high
pine-covered mountains, where his only living
companions vers the cattle and sheep be
herded for his mother. At 14 be came into
possession of a copy of Bryant's poems, his
first book, with the exception of a grammar
and an arithmetic, that he had studied dili
gently. Two years later Moore and Bryant were
added to his little library of inspiration. Mr.
Markham moved with his mother to San Fran
cisco, where he entered college. After gradu
ation he learned the blacksmith's trade, and
some of his early poems were composed to the
music of the anvil.
For a number of years, now, he has been
prominently identified with educational mat
ters in California, and he is at present the
principal of the Tompkins -School at Oakland.
There is nothing of the "pale cast of thought"
about Mr. Markham, His sturdy figure and
strong, sensitive face suggest the man of pur
pose and vigorous mentality. He is now pre
paring a volume of his poems, which has the
attractive title "On Mountain Tops."
OUTDOOR SPORTS.
OUTINGâ For tho six months ending March,
1897. The Outing Pub ishiug Company, New
York. .-..'/,. . â -â :
The twenty-ninth volume of "Outing," for
the six months ending March, 1897, fully
maintains the high level of excellence estab
lished by its predecessors. It is elegantly
printed and serviceably bound and should
find a conspicuous place on the bookshelves
of all true lovers of sport, travel and recrea
tion.
The contents of this volume are everything
that the title-page implies and have been
carefully classified under their several heads,
so that the reader will experience no difficulty
in finding interesting and instructive articles
upon every conceivable 'subject pertaining to
outdoor lite written by recognized authorities.
Hunting seems to be one of the most popular
current topics, if .pace furnishes a safe
criterion, no less than twenty articles being
devoted thereto in the present volume. There
are also several entertaining articles on
cycling, equestrianism, fishing, football, golf,
rowing, yachting, etc.. while the less technical
departments of- poetry and fiction have not
been neglected. The volume Is profusely and
tastefully illustrated.
FAMOUS PERSONAGES.
A CHAT ABOUT CELEBRITIES, OK THE
STOKY OF A BOOKâ By Cunts Guild. Lee A
t-bepnrd, Bos.oq. â 
This is a delightful volume of reminiscences
of famous personages and supplies many here
tofore unpublished anecdotes connected with
many world-wide celebrl'ies, generals, actors,
authors, poets and orators. Mr. .Guild's
method is unique. Having /been presented
with a volume of "Yesterday with Authors,"
by James T. Fields, the author of that in terest
ing book of sketches, just before the death of
Mr. Fielas, Mr. Guild conceived the Idea of
"extra illustrating" the volume by inserting
or binding up with It portrait., landscapes
and other works of art bearing a reference* to
its contents. And so as a memento of his
friend Mr. Guild extended the one volume to
four books, and in this "chat About Celebri
ties" he tells the story of this illustrated copy
of "Yesterdays with Authors," by relating
various incidents regarding the many person
ages mentioned, as. the various portraits are
described. 'â _.'.

Mrs. Denison is known throughout the coun

successful novels, among them being "That
Husband of Mine," which attained a remark
able circulation a few years since. "Cap.i.in
Molly" is in a decidedly different, vein from
ber previous work, it being a very strong story
of tne affections with many dramatic situa
tions; indeed, it is now being dramatized for
early presentation in New York. Tho scene is
laid among the East-siders of New l'ork, but
the characters are not all drawn from that
classic locality. :â  â¢/;: --..

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 23, 1897.
FRANK BAILEY MILLARD.
The subject of the above portrait is one of the most respected and well
known journalists in San Francisco, whose chief bid for prominence, however,
rests on his accomplishments in the literary rather than the merely journalistic
field. He was born in Wisconsin in 1859, came to Nevada in 1878, whence,
after desultory prospecting in that and neighboring States, he ' proceeded "to
California in 1880. He entered the newspaper field here as a compositor on the
Alta, and subsequently went to the Chronicle, where first as printer, then as
reporter, and later as assistant City editor, he stayed until 1889. He wrote
special articles for "The Call," and became City editor of this paper/ holding
the desk until 1893. He has held several responsible positions on the Examiner,
including those of night editor and City editor. At present he holds the Sunday
editor's desk. He has written short stories and special articles for many of the
magazines and local papers, and a collection of some of the tales 'has recently
been published in a book bearing the title of '"A Pretty Bandit," which is
reviewed in this issue of "The Call."

MRS. ATHERTON ON HER WORK.
The following characteristic letter has been received at THE CALL office from Mrs. Gertrude
Atherton, whose latest work, "Patience Sparhawk and Her Times," was recently reviewed in these
columns: ','â¢ -
Merryhill Cottage, bushey, Herts, England, May,7, 1897.
I have read your lament over me with much interest." I will not agree with you that 1 have gone to the dogs because
I elect to study life outside of California for a change; nor, as the first date of copyright will prove, did I write -.'Patience"
in obedience to a prevailing taste. * A year and a half before, when I began the book, the type of novel which ruled the
markets some time after had not sent out a herald. It occurred to me to portray certain phases of.the United States exactly,
as they had passed under my observation, particularly as to sensationalism. I have always maintained 'that our literature
did not represent usâ for we are the most sensational, heterogeneous and chaotic race on earth, \ and our novels â¢ would ' lead
the outsider to believe that our veins were packed with weak tea, and our skulls with the philosophy of the ages. The
writing of this book gave me no pleasure whatever and 1 usually take a very keen pleasure in my work; nevertheless, I
claim that it is the most truthful American novel that has been written, and the proof of it is that it has met with angryâ
in many cases insultingâ disapproval from almost the entire United States press. There have been two or three excep
tions, and these reviews, curiously enough, have been the only ones written in a temperate spirit.
â¢ Now, as to my writing of California. What is the use of writing stories which no one will read? 1 ; made exactly $12
on the book edition of "The Doomswoman"; and the Lippincotts were so disappointed in the sale of : the magazine in
which it first appeared that they did not feel justified in bringing it out between boards. As for "Before the Gringo Came,"
I do not believe a hundred copies of the book were sold, and the stories were refused by nearly every magazine in the United
' States. The Cosmopolitan,' under Mr. Howells' editorship, and 5 Lippincott's, published two or three of the little ones ; the
rest I had to send to England. â  The people 7in : the Eastern States care/ nothing for California. That is the brutal truth.
(They have no time to think of anything but themselves.) As for California itself, if it be true that "all residents of the ;
State possess the highest sense of admiration" for my "earlier efforts," they have taken a peculiar way of showing it Not'
only do they refuse to buy my books which treat of California subjects,* but their press, when not abusing me, studiously
- ignores me. -\ **" ._' , \- ' ' / v _ - '"'.''.'
â ;â â â ;. I have no way of judging the character of Californians who do not air their, sentiments in print and I have no quarrel 1
with them for not spending their money on what does not interest them.- But my experience of the San Francisco press has
extended over nine years and if there is anything pettier on this planet I have fortunate enough to escape it. V There
have been sporadic and notable exceptions, _ but ;. am (dealing - with i a prevailing spirit. .;.- The on books that ; 1 have so far >
written that I care a rap about are "The Doomswoman" and "Before the Gringo Came." Whether I achieved all 1 wished
to achieve or not their appearance was a signal event in California' history.'; â  Yet they, are, when a summary of California
literature is made by the ambitious hacks of the press, never mentioned, and it is doubtful if they are on the shelves of ten-
California libraries. Nevertheless 1 have written another California* novel and am at work upon still another. Whether I
return to the early history of the State depends upon whether ever make up my mind to return to the State itself. T have
been tempted to write this to you because ; your /article, /although . severe, was friendly." You can use your own preference
about publishing it. Yours very truly, GERTRUDEfATHERTON. V:

THE BEST TWELVE STORIES.
In January last the Critic, so as to judge
what was the public taste, called upon its
readers to give lists of the twelve stories
which they deemed the best. The authors
were to be Americans. Tue Critic was to act
as judge, and two prizes were offered. In the
last issue of the Critic the first prize was
awarded to the following list, which was sent
by J. W. George of St. Louis : "The Man With
out a Country," Hale; "The Luck of Roaring
Camp," Bret Harte; "The Gieat Stone Face,".
Hawthorne; "The Snow Image," Hawthorne;
"The Gold Bug," Poe; -'The Murders in the
Rue Morgue," Poe; "The Lady, or the
Tiger?" Stockton; "The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow," Irving; "Rip Van Winkle," Irving;
"Marse Chan,". Thomas* Nelson Page; "Mar
jorie Daw," Thomas Bailey Aldrich; "The Re
volt of Mother," Mary E. Wilkins. The second
list of twelve, which was entitled, to a prize,
was confined to one story by a single author.
G. Adams of New . York was the recipient of
thl3 prize. His list was: > "Marjorle . Daw,"
Aldrich; "Love in .Old Clothes,". Bunncr;
"The Lady, or the Tiger?" Stockton; "A Hum
ble Romance," Mary E. Wilkins; . ''The Gold
Bug," Poe; ''The Birthmark," Hawthorne;

"The Jumping Frog," Mark Twa n; "The Man
Without a Country,''. Hale; "Men Lady,"
Thomas Nelson Page; ''Posson Jone," "Cable;
"Gallegher," Richard Harding Davis. Tastes
vary, but both lists are good onas. Mr. Adams'
is a trifle more modern than the one Mr. George
selects. " j'.- â . .
READING PROOFS OF POETRY.
Some writer has produced a poem called
'Sounds From the Sanctum." It reads prettily
and gives rise to the thought that the author
never visited the sanctum when business was
in full swing. If he had called about mid
night, for instance, he would have seen two
menâ one poring over a proof-slip, the other
holding the copy, and the sounds would have
been something like this:
Proofreaderâ As flowers without the sun
shine fairâ commaâ without youâ comma
Iâ breatne a dark and dismal mair- â
Copy-holderâ Tnunder! not mairâ air.
Proofreaderâ breathe a dark and dismal
air â commaâ of flowersâ comma.
Copy-holderâ Shoot the comma, f. ._
Proofreaderâ 'Tis done. As bowers without
the sunshine fairâ semi-colonâ confound slug
seven, he never justifies his linesâ No joy in
lifeâ commaâ no worms- â - .
Copy-holderâ Warm h. : - - ;. .
Proofreaderâ No ; warmth I sbare â commaâ
and health and vigorous fliesâ
Copy-holderâ Health and vigor fly. :.-./

is on deck. .

The Literary Index is the title of a new
monthly whose second title is "a ready refer
ence index to current literature." It ls edited
by Franklin Thomas and published by K. W.
Black from the Claxton building, Chicago.
The Index begins with the April issue and
contains a short title-list of the books of the
month, contents of the April magazines, brief
descriptive notes of the leading books, liter
ary gossip, notes of the magazines of the previ
ous month and editorial notes.
Paul Bourget, it will be remembered, brought
and won a suit against his French publishers
some months ago to compel ihem to give him
an accounting. His example inspired his
fellow-novelist Galdos to a similar course, and
the Madrid lower court has pronounced in his
favor. As in Bourgei's case there ls no ques
tion of violation of -contract, but the plea is
that an author has a right to know from actual
inspection of accounts, not merely from state
ments rendered, just how his books are selling.
j The author is well known who objected to
the length of the pages of his forthcoming
book when the galley proofs were sent to him.
Word now comes from a customer who re
turned a copy or a book with uncut edges be
cause she "Unas that it is not completed, and
can scarcely " be called a book, as the leaves
are mostly closed." She closes her letter to
the bookseller with: "1 sincerely hope that
you will have-it finished and return it to me.
I bought it for a friend who is ill, but I was
ashamed to present it in that form." -
Nansen, whose "Farthest North" is in such
demand that the Messrs. Harper & Brothers

before the Royal Geographical Society. He
said that to reach the pole was merely a ques

would have gone there. The dogs would have
served for locomotion and food. The Fra in,
he also said, was a very good ship, but that
with his experience he could build a better
craft. j It would be al ong trip to reach the

Henry Frowde Is preparing a number of new
prayer-books and bibles in commemoration of
Queen Victoria's long reign. The "Queen's
Diamond Jubilee Prayer-Book" will be in four
sizes, embellished -by. two portraits of the
Queen, one taken when she was young, the
other a recent photograph. The bibles are in
four sizes, and also contain portraits of Queen
Victoria. The Joint Hymnal Committee of
the Presbyterian Churches of Scotland has
unanimously appointed Henry Frowde, of the
Oxford University Press, to publish the new
hymnal.

The highest price ever paid for single
volume was tendered by a number of wealthy-

for a very ancient Hebrew Bible. It was then
believed to be an original copy of the Scptua

in 277 ;B. C..'* careful t copies of the . Hebrew
text having been prepared at that date " for
the use of tho seventy translators. The offer
to Julius was Â£20,000, which, considering the
difference of value of money then and now,
would in our day represent the princely sum
of $600,000. Julius was at that time greatly

declined the offer.

The B ronte Museum at Haworth has been
formally opened, Clement Shorter delivering
an address entitled "Some More New Light
on the Brontes." "The Brontes in Fact and
Fiction" is the name of still another book on
the family announced for early publication in
London. It is by the Rev. Angus Mackay.
It is stated- that In the new novel on which
John Oliver Hobbes is engaged she has intro
duced several prominent politicians among
the chief characters. Lord Beaconsfleld plays
a conspicuous part in the story, which is en
titled "A School for Saints." The novel is
longer than "The Gods, Some Mortals and
Lord Wickenham." '-?;.* â â ',
Another volume is announced by the Mac-,
millan Company in the uniform series of the
works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Two volumes
have been published, as follows : g Volume XI,
containing "The Case of Wagner," "The Twi
light Idols" and "Nleiz-che Contra Wagner,"
and volume IX "Thus Spake Zarathustra."
The new volume is entitled the "Genealogy of
Morals" and is justly considered , scarcely less
remarkable than the author's great prose
poem of Zarathustra.
"The Outgoing Turk: Impressions of a
Journey Through the Western Balkans" is the
title of an important book by H. C. Thomson,
author of "The Chitral Campaign," which ia
to be published shortly, by D. Appleton & Co.
Mr. Thomson, bas traveled over 800, miles
through Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he pre
sents a graphic picture of the effect of twenty
years of. Christian control. He also discusses
the problems offered by Armenia and Greece
and the attitude of Russia.
Teachers of natural science will find in Mrs.
Wright's "Citizen Bird" a delightful book for
young people, written especially for "those
who are making a beginning in the study of
bird life. It will be fully illustrated with
drawings from nature. Lovers of Mrs.
Wright's larger and more technical work on
birds will not need to be told of the interest
ing style of the new work, and for those who
have not yet read "Birdcraft" the association
of Dr. Elliott Coves' name with that of Mrs.
Wright on the title-page will speak for -its
accuracy and scientific value.
The Macmlllan â¢ Company announces for
early publication a book with the name "Life
Histories of American Insects." There is no
book precisely like this in the field and the au
thor of this one is exceptionally well qualified
by previous experience - both a3 an observer
and as an author. The work is by Clarence
M. Weed, professor of zoology and entomol

ture and Mechanic Arts, entomologist ot the
New Hampshire Experiment Station, and as

whole of the military correspondence and
memoranda of "his grandfather, the Emperor
William I, including his latest proposals re
specting the defensive power of the country,
which have been printed' verbatim from his

print of the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,"
which had such a large sale last year. The new
edition will be bound In soft fiber paper cov
ers and printed on fine imported deckle edge
paper. Price 25c. The interest in this famous
Persian poem has greatly increased during
the past few years, and Omar Khayyam clubs
are being formed in various parts of this
country and England. It was this fact that
led to the issuing of the poem in the new edi
tion. , . ,-â¢
Mrs. John Sherwood, whose autobiography

Edelyn's Experience.
BY CKESCEXCIA EPSON (C. R. C).
It was after **chool on a very warm day
in June when EJelyn Blame entered her
mother's room with a frowning face.
"I have an old arithmetic lesson to do
to-day, and it will take me the whole
afternoon. I shan't be able to play a bit!
Oh, why was arithmetic ever made?" she
exclaimed in indignant tones.
'â Mamma, I'm going to the woods for
just half an hour to play."
"But, my dear," said her mother very
gently, "you should prepare your lesson
for to-morrow before you go."
"But, mamma, it will be so late then
that I can't have any fan, and if I go now
lean get my lessons in the evening."
. "Very well," assented Mrs. Blame, "yon
may go for half an hour. I'll try you this
once; but if you do not keep yonr prom
ise, remember, no woods for you again
this month!''
"Ob, thank you, mamma; I'll surely
remember," cried the delighted child, as
off she ran, about the happiest little girl
in all California, and she was soon gay
skipping along through the fragrant pine
forest.
On and on she went, heeding neither
time nor distance.
After awhile it began to prow dark, but
Edelyn was so happy sbe did not notice
that the snn had almost disappeared.
At last she grew tired and sat down on
a mossy bank to rest.
Then, lulled by the soft breezes and
listening to the mournful cooing of a
dove in a tree near by, the tired little girl
fell fast asleep.
' She did not awaken until it was very,
very dark. Just think of a little girl all
alone in the midst of a forest on a pitch
dark night!
Of course she felt greatly frightened,
and began to cry and cry and cry.
Suddenly a step near by and the crack
of a limb startled her. Turning quickly
she beheld by her aide a little man. just
about four inches high. Strange to say
be was shaped exactly like the figure
nine. He was dressed in green, trimmed
with gold, and wore on his foot a tiny
patent leather boot.
"Why are you crying so bitterly, my
little one?" he asked in the kindest of
tones. '*- -'.io
. "Iâ l'm scared ; and it's it's so dark;
and I'mâ l'm far away from home, and I
don't don't know now to get back," she
sobbed.
"Why, is that all?" laughed he. "Don't
be afraid ; I know you quite well. You
are tbe little girl who doesn't like arith
metic! The little girl named Edelyn."
. "How in the world did you find that
out?" she asked in surprise, "ana what
is your name?" _ ; H 5 --}" 'â¢'"'
"Never mind how I found it out, but I'll
tell you my name. It is 'Shutsomboo.' "
"Ste here, my child; it's high time you
were asleep somewhere. It is too late for
you to go home, so I'll take you with me."
"All right," said Edelyn, ea.er for ad
venture; "I'm .willing." She tried to
arise, but found she was so stiff from sleep
ing in the damp air of tbe night that she
could not move a joint.
"Oh, I can't walk she cried.
"Don't mind that. You'll soon forget
all about pain, and, besides I'll get some
one to carry you !"
GOOD NEWS BY WIRE.
IN CHILHOOD'S REALM.
He took a little silver whistle from his
pocket and blew it three times. The call
was answered from the woods and in a few
moments there appeared be/ore them a
figure-four-shaped donkey, drawing a
figure-one-shaped wagon, in which was
seated another tiny man, for all the world
exactly like the figure three.
Edelyn could scarcely keep from laugh
ing outright at the comical sight as Shut
somboo introduced the newcomer.
â¢This is Mr. Plus, Edelyn; he will take
charge of you and show yon the sights."
Then she was tenderly lifted by unseen
hands into the wagon and was driven
rapidly through the forest.
Pretty soon they reached a small town.
"A crazy little place," Edelyn thought,
for all the streets, houses, people and ani
mals were shaped like figures.
"Here we are," Pius cried. "Follow me
and Pll ask my wife to give you some
supper and put you to bed. In the morn
ing I'll show you around the town."
As they neared Plus' house the figure
shaped poultry and animals in the buck
yard set up a terrible outcry. Pretty soon
Edelyu could distinguish word*, and
scarcely relieving her ears, she heard the
hens cackling, the roosters crowing, the
donkeys braying and ihe pigs squealing
these words, "Here she comes! Look at
her! Look at her! The little girl who
goes off to play before she studies her
lesÂ«ons!"
Plus ordered them to be quiet, and
seemed to feel badly that they were so
rude to his guest.
Edelyn felt ashamed, and could scarcely
swallow the figure-shaped food which was
set before her.
After breakfast the next morning Plus
took her to a large plaza, or park, in the
center of which was a great pile of
luscious pears. Around t is pi c were _
great many people, all busily engaged in
ti h**r adding more pears to it or taking
away from the number.
"What are they doing that foi? ' asked
Edelyn. . . ....
"Well, you sep, Mis 3," answered Plus,
"this is Number Town, and those people
are adding and subtracting."
"Addine and subtracting. -.'What do
you mean?"
"Why, you see some of the people are
putting on more pears, that's adding; and
tho ones wbo are carrying away the fruit
are subtracting "
"Ob," said tbe little girl.
They then left the pear market and
went into a large building, which con
tained only one room.
Down this room, from end to end, stood
a table. On it were hundreds and thou
sands of pieces ot plates and around it
were seated a great many men and women,
who were trying to place the pieces to
gether to form perfect plates.
"What are they doing here?' inquired
Edelyn, greatly interested.
Plus, ever agreeable to and patient with
his visitor, explained to her that they
were trying to form whole plates out of
parts.
'.'But how do they know how to find the
right parts?" **^' : *
"By the shape and size of what they
commence with. If they find one-third
t..ey know they need two-thirds more to
make tbo whole."
"Ob, I understand now." said she, "bet
ter than I ever did at school."
Thus they went on all through Number
Town.and Plus did his best to settle the puz-
ing problems which had so often wor
ried the little girl.
Finally she became very hungry, and
they had to return to the house. There,
seated at the dinner table, was jolly
Shutsomboo, and Edelyn related to him
some of her strange experiences.
s After the meal was over Shutsomboo
cried, "It's time for you to go home, now,"
and picking her up carried her to the top
of a ladder. He then touched an invisi
ble button, which set a bell io ringing at a
great rate. All at once there sailed over
their heads and to the top of the ladder a
magnificent balloon, Into which the little
girl was pushed.
It was furnished in grand style, like a
beautiful parlor, and best of nil, on the
pretty table was a silver dish of delicious
candies and fruits. . .-/.: .....
.Edelyn ate as much as she could and
then looked out of tbe windows at the
clouds and treetops. Then becoming tired
she threw herself on a soft couch and was
soon in the land of dreams.
How long she slept she could not tell,
for when she awoke she was lying on the
grass in the forest. It was very/dark, but
she did not feel atraid, ' for bending over
her was her own dear father. 'His lace
looked r-ither sad and white and he held
a large lantern in one hand. Without a
word he picked her up and carried her
nome where her mother was waiting.
After being forgiven for her thought
lessness, she told her parents about her
trip to Number Land.
They laughed and said it was only a
dream suggested by a guilty conscience,
but Edelyn â¢till believes it was a real ex
perience. Strange to say, irom that night
she has taken a great interest in arithme
tic and always stands very high in that
study. She eives to little . Plus-all ithe

A Little Incident
in a Country School.
The children in the fourth-reader class were
reciting from the long bench in front of the
room when a knock was heard at the door. . A
pupil opened it; a man stepped in and handed
the teacher some bills with the announcement/
"Show to-nignt at the schoolhouse. half-past
seven." j. â ....- .
Outside a large wagon was standing and an
other man was busy putting up' a tent close by
the school building. : For the rest of the morn
ing the excited children ctiuld hardly bs con
trolled. Such a thing had never happened be
fore in the history of the little school district,
situated seven miies from a town. , .
At the noon recess the boys all gathered
around the little lent and cazed as only coun
try boys can at the. camping outfit and pre
parations being made for the men's dinner.
They saw a small boy seated in the wagon
looking at them with wide-open eyes. ;
t Such a tiny, Utile fellow he was, with big
brown eyeÂ«, long yellow curls and a big hat
set back on his head. He ; climbed down as
soon as he got over his shyness, and' by the
time school was reopened at noon he -joined
the line in a most friendly way and marched
in, with the rest. -To my question as to r wnat
his name was ha put on au air of most engag
ing irankr:essae.d told me he was "Mr. Riley,'.'
but added hastily: 1 'My real -name' is .Nolly
Evans. Â« 1" can , sing 'Mr. Riley', and ' 'Poverty
Row* and I can dance a jig and hang my nead
from a f bar."
; This last piece of information was delivered
with such an air of pride that I laughed out
right, while the children gazed in speechless
wonder at the small prodigy. ;'.'
All the afternoon the little fellow sat on the
front seat and! listened with rapt attention to
ail the recitations.; Alter school he waited for
me to come out, and, slipping . his - hand ( into
mine, he went home with me,' talking all the
time. He said that he liked the children very
much/because they lee him;' play i f with them.
Then j lm added wistfully: "1 never play with
children any more since we went on the road.
I play ;I â¢ am an'_ Irishman on â  the stage, and
sometimes 1 am a Dutchman." -'/".-â¢ * 'â¢>
Then he said: "My mamma is away off, but
my pipa takes care of me and curls my hair.
He can make all kinds of curls, 'cept one."
To my inquiry what kind that was he replied:
"The kind you make on the curling-irons. He
can't make them." -./-, â 
That evening the little schoolhouse was well
filled. The performance was of the variety
order, including a magic-lantern exhibi
tion. But the main attraction to the Children
was the dear little yellow-haired Fountleroy.
He sang and danced, and was vigorously ap
plauded by every one. His part of the pro
gramme soon ended, and after he had finished
singing "Mr. Reily" he came down the aisle
to the place where I was sitting, with a dear
little fair-haired girl by mv side.
Nolly stood by us a moment and I mode
room for him on the seat. Iv a few minutes I
heard him whisper: "1 will tell you how Shar
ley eats "glass. He puis gum in his mouth
and chews the glass in that." Sharley was

On the second day of July last year a party

By the Fourth wo had reached a little va'ley
where we stepped to celebrate. The place was
called Fish Camp. That night I sat by a camp
fire in the drizzling rain and watched the
fireworks until quite late.
After remaining nt this place for two or
three days, until we were quite rested, we
started again on our journey.
Finally wo reached the beautiful Yosemlte
Valley alter dark one night and pitched our
tents.
In the morning we saw around us lovely

! Dear Editress and Readers: I promised ln my
last lettei to tell of some little bantam chick
ens my sisters and I have for pets. First, an
old hen, belonging to a neighbor, stole her
ne3t away in the brush and finally brought
home six little chicks. As it was rather late
in the fall and very cold our neighbor said if
we thought we could raise the little chicks in
the cold weather we could have them. We
were very much pleased and took tbem home
with the old hen, which we were to ke.-p until
the little ones grew large enough to care for
themselves. . Tne poor little things had tails
that looked. much too large, but they them
selves did not grow very fasi, and mamma
came to the conclusion that they must be ban
tams. At last we took the old hen home
and the chicks got along very nicely. One ran
away, the old hen stepped on one, and another
got separated from the rest and froze to death.
Then .we had three left, two of -Â-nom were
roosters and one a little hen. After awhile we
bad a present of. two-more, a rooster and a
hen. ., It Is quite interesting to watch the lit
tle cock chase all the big ones away from the
food. At night he roosts alone up high where
he can look down and keep watch over the
whole coop full. .They are all very tamo and
pretty. Their little eggs are not much larger
than a pigeon's egg. Mamma is going to send
a pair oi bantams to our little cousins, who
sometimes write to yon from Pajaro. Good-by
for this time, your constant reader,

When au indulgent audience called on
Nat 0. Goodwin for a speech on Monday
night he improved the shining hour by
confiding to his hearers that he had sev
eral new plays in view for next season and
that in the meantime he bad on hand a
lot of English and Australian plays for
sale cheap. Tnis tempting offer may have
been a little joke on Mr. Goodwin's part â
he has rather grim ideas of humor at
timesâ but if he really meant that he pos
sesses a ple.hora of plays, why in the
name of common sense does he not produce
some of them himself?
Goodwin has come back to us after an
absence scarcely long enough to make the
heart grow fonder, and he has brought
only one novelty (sic) with him, "David
Garriek." I should imagine that a come
dian who has to resurrect one of Tom
Kobertson's old comedies must be very
hard up indeed for a play, and I for one
was prepared to pity Goodwin as a victim
to the prevailing barrenness of the play
market. After hearine him say. however,
that he had plays to sell, the only logical
conclusion to arrive at was that he had
found s mething to tempt and allure him
in the role of David Garrick.
Just where the bond of sympathy be
tween Goodwin and the role of David
Garriek lies was not perceptible to the
naked eye and the unaided intelligence
from seeing him play the part. The
sympathy was not in the costume, par
ticularly in those parts of it embracing
silk stockings, for nature did not design
the lively Nathaniel for the exposing of
his nether extremities in clinging hose,
and in his top boots he looked like a man
walking about on two slender pipe
stems. The sympathy certainly did not
lie in tbe powder, which was unbecoming,
nor in the satin suits and the sword, for
the comedian wore them all with the
air of a nineteenth century farmer
masquerading at a fancy-dress ball.
There was not a touch, not a suggestion
of the grace belonging to an age that
thought more of external polish than it
did of inward and spiritual grace.
In bis conception of David's character
Goodwin came no more in touch with the
ileal David Garriek than be did in bearing
and appearance. He was an essentially
fin de siecle David Garriek, the sort of
swain who might be expected to allude to
Ada Ingot a3 "My theater mash," or to
her father as "The Old Man," and anni
hilating space as well as time Goodwin
transplanted England's historic actor to
this side of the Atlantic. This naturaliza
tion of David Garriek was involuntary on
the comedian's part, but none the less was
it aggressively apparent, for he has a
touch of the banjo in his voice which
proudiy proclaims in every accent, "Made
in America."
Altogether "David Garriek" is entirely
out of Goodwin's mental and physical
grip, but this need cause no wailing and
lamentation, for the comedy, like Robert
son's other works, was made for a more
artificial and conventional generation ana
does not appeal strongly to end of tbe cen
tury play-goers. The only matter for re
gret is ihat Goodwin revived it at all,
when we have it on his own authority tbat
he has plays to sell.
Since returning home from his foreign
travels T. Daniel Frawiey seems to have
been changing his mind to an extent
usually supposed to be the solo preroga
tive of what society novelists call "the
fair sex." On the night of his arrival I
heard Frawiey remark for publication
that he intended to retire from the stage
for the present and devote himself to the
duties of stage management. "I feel that
I have not been able to do myself justice
in the acting line. My mind has been
burdened with the responsibilities of the
performance and I have not given myself
a chance as an actor. The critics on the
Pacific Coast have been exceedingly leni
ent with me, but in spite of their kindness
1 realize that my acting has not been up
to my usual standard."
After being a witness to the throwing of
this bouquet at the critics it was some
thing of a surprise to take up the Mirror
and read that saving ana excepting one
"old sage" T. Daniel Frawiey's opinion of
the San Francisco critics is that they "mis
take personal comment for criticism and
forget that any one may be funny by
brutality." The versatile Mr. Frawiey
has since put himself on record as affirm
ing that the Mirror misquoted him. There
were able criticsâ several "old sages" in
factâ though the Mirror had sifted them
down to one. Whether Frawiey's personal
opinion of the critics is favorable or other
wise is a matter that is not at all likely to
interest the public, but some remarks that
he makes in this connection are worth quot
ing by reason of their exceeding naivete.
In denying the correctness of the Mirror
interview he says: "If a man's acting is
suitable isn't it enough to say so? But
why say, 'Oh, yes, his acting is good
enough, but one of his legs is shorter than
the other,' or 'one of bis ears is longer
than its mate'? An actor, male or female,
naturally has a sensitive organization, if
be or she is entitled to the name of actor,
and the public little know the anguish
caused by unmerited abuse."
Now this is ridiculous. No one would
deny the rudeness of personal remarks,
and to abuse an actor for being lame -â¢ or
lop-eared would be positively unchris
tian, but such a man has no business in
tbe profession. An actor's appearance is
part of his stock in trade, and as such can
and must be commented on. Goodness
knows, actors and actresses unusually en
dowed with good looks make capital
enough out of the fact and never display
any sensitiveness about letting their press
agents boom their beauty in tbe columns
of every newspaper that will consent to
boom it. A man with "one leg shorter
than the other has not the necessary
stock in trade for becoming a Romeo or a
Claude Melnotte, and it would be. flying
in the face of providence for' him to at
tempt such a part. As for. the critics,
theirs . would be . a case ..of, love's
labor lost if they dismissed. a lame Romeo
with the soothing remark: "Reasons
which delicacy forbids us to mention pre
vented Mr. Dot-and-carry-one from mak
ing the hit of his life in tbe part. '. His
mental conception of Romeo would doubt
less have been appreciated had not con
ditions, which it would wound his sensi
tiveness to mention, made the gallery
openly deride him.". " :
The fact is that Frawiey. would be as on*
I kely as any other sane manager to en
gage the lame, the ball, the. blind and the
lop-cared for parts written for the whole,
I and when he implies that critic* have no
I .
j right to comment on an actor's physical
| fitness or unfitness for his part, he is sim
| ply doing what is known in the vernacular
I as "talking through his hat."

For the second and last week of his
engagement Nat C. Goodwin will present
the comedy success, "An American Citi
zen," which Madeline Lucette Ryley
wrote for htm. The play was given its
first American production at the Baldwin
Theater last November and made a very
favorable impression. It tells the atory
of a yonng and energetic American, who, ,
by his native energy and pluck, over- j
comes a world of difficulties, all due to
the insular prejudices of a stubborn Eng
lishman. . In tne role of ..Beatrice Coiew |
Maxine Elliott has apart that suits her i
histrionically, and in addition gives her
an opportunity of maKing considerable ,
toilet display. The staging of "An Amer
ican Citizen" is effective, especially in i
the second act, which shows Nice at car
nival time.
The next attraction at the Baldwin
Theater will be tne popular Liiiputians,
who are to open an engagement of two
weeks on Monday evening, June 7. -They
are to appear in a new and what is said to
be an exceptionally fine spectacular pro
duction called "Merry Tramps."
Columbia Jheater.
"Excelsior Jr." will be presented for the
last time to-night. For the rest of this :
wÂ«.ek the theater will be closed to permit !
of alterations and improvements, and on
Monday evening, May 31. it will be re
opened by the Frawiey company in Had
don Chambers' up-to-date melodrama,
'The Fatal Card." Its story starts in a
mining town at the foot of the Rockies,
where George Forrester is rescued from !
the vig-lantes by Gerald Austen. For
rester, appreciating Austen's good turn,
tears a card in half, and, giving him one
of tbe pieces, says that if at any time he
needs help to present the card and he
(Forrester) will respond. The scene then
shifts to England, w ere Forrester be
comes the head of a band of bond robbers.
Austen, who has fallen in love with For
rester's daughter â he is now known as
Marrableâ is accused of de murder of his
father. The usual complications growing
out of persecuted innocence follow, oi
course. The bit of card is presented* at
just the right moment, and everything
turns out happily after a bomb designed,
to end the hero's life has worked retribu
tive justice. The play will be staged here
with new scenery and appointments.

Stoddard the "coming playwright.'.' on ac

at the Fifth-avenue -Theater. Of course,
ban â¢ Frincisco will not â "_ see "Tess" this

says so, and he ought to know; but San

thing new in the dramatic line while the
bloom is on the rye.'lt is a new depart-,
ure for a dramatist to come out here with'

Mitt, "as great in comedy as she is in

me to dramatize 'Tess.' Hardy had* - done

Investigations Are Now Being Made to Determine the Motion of the Universe
Though California is commercially, and
even intelleclÂ«ually, somewhat detached
from the great centers of progress, it is
satisfactory to know that it has within its
limits a scientific institution that distance
cannot isolate, and that will long remain
a center of interest to the entire astron
omical world. The creditable work ot the
Lick Observatory needs no repetition, and
some of its achievements are known
at the ends of the earth. Since
its completion several colossal telescopes
have been stimulated into existence. in
various parts of the world, and it some
times seerc-s as if the choicest laurels of
scientific fame might hereafter be won in
other climes.
While true science knows no rivalry
and rejoices at progress regardless of
locality, still it will be pleasing to Cali
fornians to learn that tbeir astronomical

shrine is now devoting a share of its effi
ciency to an important branch of research
never before undertaken on such a large
scale nor with such powerful and elabo
rate equipments. This is a determination
of the motion of the stars either toward
the earth or away from it and the number
of miles per second each observed star
travels in these directions. Stellar spec
troscopy and the photography of stellar
spectra were included in the schedule of
work suggested by Professor Holden. in
1--74 to the trustees of the Lick Observa
tory, and both have been efficiently car
ried on from time to time by members of
the staff, but the aim, scope and methods
of the work undertaken overshadow all
previous efforts. *

most accurate form of development are
required for its fulfillment, and also a
An Irreverent Dissertation on the Delicate Relation of Modern Literature to Food
Turning over a published collection of
Thackeray's letters the other day I came
across the following to his friend Brook
field:
My Dear Vieux: When I came home
last night I found a beautiful opera ticket
for this eveningâ Jenny Lind; charming
bally; box 72. I am going to dine at
heme with the children, and shall go to
the opera, and will leave your name down
below. Do come, and we will sit, we 2,
and see the piece like 2 lords; and* we
can do the other part afterward. I pre
sent my respectful compliments to Mrs.
Brookfield, and am yours. W. M. T.
If you can come to dinner there's a
curry.
In that postcript we have a glimpse of
the man as he really was, and the invita
tion to the curry is quite characteristic of
him, for it was doubtless a good one and
flavored with assafcetidaâ hence his gen
erous mention of it. By the way, the
Biookfield who received the invitation is
the "Old Brooks" of one of Tennyson's
sonnets, ami, doubtless, deserved all the
good things offered him.
Thackeray gave much time to the sub
ject of dining. I am not here concerned
with the evanescent material banquets
that he actually put under his waistcoat,
but with those far nobler leasts that he.
spread with such lavish liberality and
good taste everywhere in his books and
the savor of which never palls on one's
palate. He paid more attention to the
solidsâ an altogether brutal, and inade
quate word â than to the -vines offered to
his readers at these barmecide banquets.
Wine has had its panegyrists since it was
first made, and poets and writers of all
ages and nations have vied with each
other in singing it? praises; but whoever
thought of writing a sonnet to a sauce or
an ode to a cheese souffle? Take up any of
tho current magazines, or examine the
works of any of the poets of the latter
half of the nineteenth century, and what
do you find? : Merely the old, old theme
of he and she, and the stars and flowers
and children (too much about children, of
late, and in bad taste), and' such /other
trivial matters. No serious poet has for
ages given a thought to some of God's no
blest worksâ â¢ the things we eat and
whereof we are made.

chosen work, to which his time during
the coming live years will be devoted, to
the exclusion of nearly all other branches
of research. , Probably the most precise
work done in this line previous to 1894
was that of Dr. Keeler, formerly of the
Lick Observatory, with the visual spec

requirements of the great work he has

results has been carefully considered, and
it is safe to assert that all previous work
in this line is distanced by the accuracy of
adjustment, as well as by the light-gath

That expressive phrase, the star depths,
which contradicts the vaulted aspect of
the sky, applies chiefly to the range of ar
tificially aided vision, though the ordinary
observer also fathoms more or less with
every glance. It is easily discerned that
Sirius shines with, a bluish white light,
that Arcturus, now on the meridian at 10
p. m., has a yellow tint, and tbat Antares
at the same hour scintillates from the
southeast with a fiery gleam.
The use of the prism emphasizes these
differences and reveals that the discerned
tint of each really predominates in its
spectrum. The dark lines crossing the re
fracted beams differ in number, position
and aspect,. though a few are identical in'
all. As these lines are a clew to many of
the constituents of an incandescent body
the materials of a distant star are not al
together unknown. Absorption lines of
hydrogen predominate in the spectrum of
Sirius and of all white stars, which are
accordingly classed as of the first or Sirian
'type. . -â -â¢-. i* . /-'- -
The spectra of yellow stars may be
briefly described as faint copies of an
alyzed sunlight, and are known as of the
second or solar j type. 1 These two classes
comprise very nearly the entire celestial
host, but a few hundred being as yet
known. - The latter are subdivided into a
third and fourth type. While there is a
marked difference in the typical speci
mens of each class, as shown in the illus
tration, there have been found, however,
a few intermediate spectra that suggest a
gradual development of stellar conditions.

â  Professor Campbell engages in bis
arduous task unhampered by preconceived
ideas as to star drift, and in a certain
sense, holding bis mind aloof from all
inferences derived from previous inves
tigations, spectroscopic or otherwise, as to
stellar motion, turns the grand equipment
at his command to the sole aim of accu-
mutating the best procurable data. That
this expectation is fully warranted, there
is no doubt, as the most eminent explorers
in the past have not been equally equipped
for this work. Vogel, though using a
spectrograph since 1888, until quite
recently, had but a medium sized tele
scope; and the excellent equipment of
Professor Pickering for spectra photo
graphy, as it includes a slitless spectro
scope, is unfitted for observations in the
line of sight. The contradictory evidence
of observers as to the rate of recession of
Arcturus, which . is one of the orbs at
present under spectrographic scrutiny at
the Lick Observatory, shows the extreme
difficulty of such estimates.
Formerly the supposed rate was fifty
five miles per second, but this is now cor
rected by the - concurrent measures of
Vogei, Keeler and Campbell to four miles
per second. An idea may be gained of
the spaces to be measured by glancing at
the space between tbe two close lines un
der the letter D in : the representation of
the sun's spectrum.* If a line were dis
placed one-fortieth of that space it would
indicate a journey in the line of sight of
about four miles per second. â¢-â¢.â â¢
It is customary to express the wave
lengths of light in tenth meters, and as
they range from less than 4000 in the vio
let to ! nearly ' . 8000 in the red, the wave
length of a line explains Its position in
the spectrum.
Professor Campbell's observations will
ba chiefly confined to those lines between
4250 and 4420, which correspond with those
under G in the illustration. Many of these
are well-known hydrogen lines, but he
also expects to use calcium and iron lines.
This is the violet end of the spectrum to
which the photographic plate is most sen
sitive. . Sirius yields the impress of its
spectrum in twenty seconds, whereas Arc
turus requires three minutes, chiefly ow
ing to the scarcity of actinic rays in its
spectrum. At present solar stars are
being observed, and later on attention will
be given to Sirian and red stars, accord
ing as favorable specimens of each class
come to view. As three nights per week
will be devoted to this work during the
coming five years it is expected that about
600 stars will be used, including orbs from
first to fifth magnitude of the Sirian and
solar types, and from first to third or
fourth magnitude of the red types, thus
accumulating a large amount of data of
the highest order of accuracy.
The C rossley reflector, already renowned
for its photographic work, will take the
place of refracting light gatherar for the
spectrographs prisms at times and also
the 12-inch refractor according to the re
quirements of , the object viewed and at
mospheric conditions. That the scope of
these res -arches will -lead to grand and
reliable results can scarcely be doubted,
but they may be partly negative. They
may be confirmatory of the meager evi
dence before gleaned, or they may re
fute previous testimony as to motion in
the line of sight and perhaps too as to
the apex ol the sun's way. There may be
some drawbacks as yet unknown to the
value of the data, as is suggested by W.

J. Laird.ARIZONA'S BALANCING ROCK.
One of the most remarkable natural
wonders of Arizona is Boulder Park, about
eighty miles north of . Phoenix and eight
miles from Congress station. And the
most wonderful thing in this wonderland
is Balancing Rock. From a distance the
formation resembles two huge eggs, one
lying upon the top of the other. The egg
shaped pieces are masses of solid granite,
and so 'huge are they that a man may
walk upright between them to the very
point of contact. .
Boulder Park is usually described as be
ing near the famous Yarnell goldmine,
and this lies at the summit of Antelope
Hill. But the trail is a rocky one that
leads from the Yarnell mine into Boulder
Park, for the park begins almost at the
base of Antelope Hill. Bowlders ars
strewn everywhere. At first they are
comparatively small, but as one descends
the trail they grow larger until they as
eume almost ; the proportions of moun
tains.
They are granite bowlders, and none of
them have rough corners. Some mighty
mass, as heavy as a world, it would seem,
has moved over what, was once a range
of granite bills, and ground them into
separate blocks that vary in size from a
cobblestone to a mountain. Nearly all
the bowlders are separate pieces, and the
manner in which they are scattered about
is a marvelous sight to â  behold. Many of
them are balanced, one upon another,
apparently in such a manner that a very
Blight jar would cause a big crash.
Boulder Park is clearly the handiwork
cf the glacial period. Worlds of ice have
moved over this region of the earth and
left their pathway as one now beholds it.
The most curious and symmetrical work
of the glaciers is shown in the illustra
tion, which represents Balancing Rock.
Both of th*se bowlders are quite smooth
in contour, and the summit of the upper
one is fully 200 feet from the base of the
lower. The upper rock is almost of a per
fect egg shape, while the lower one is a
projecting butte or bulb like end of a very
long, round slab of granite. The two
rocks are entirely separate pieces, though
the wind of long ages has swept in sev
eral tons of earth all around at the point
of connection, until now there seems to
be a connecting shaft between them.
What remarkable convulsion of nature
could have tossed high this mountainous
mass of granite and left it balancing upon
the apex of the lower rock not even the
most learned of geologists who have vis
ited the spot da hazard a guess. But
there it lias rested through the ages, and
many travelers who have teen it consider j

THE MOST PICTURESQUE CANAL IN NORTH AMERICA
The Viga canal, one of the most beautiful sights of Mexico, is never shown to
visitors by the natives. It must be conceded to be one of the oddest canals in the
world, an I certainly the most picturesque on the American continent, and yet a per
son might live in the Mexican capital for months and not a single hotel proprietor
would ever think of directing attention to it. They all will gladly point the way to
the new brick railroad depot, "like they have in the States," but the quaint beauties of
Li Viga have evidently grown to be considered commonplace.
The date of the building of the Viga canal has been lost in the mist of ages. The
marvel was there when Cortez came, and from all that can be learned it is of Aztec
origin. Certainly Montezuma has traveled on it and maybe countless generations did
likewise before bis time.
But it is the Viga canal of the present day that we are interested in, and, indeed,
many parts of it look now exactly as they presumably did several hundred years ago.
It is different from any other canal in the world and in point of picturesqueness rivals
any of the famed artificial waterways of modern construction.
From the plaza of the City of Mexico a short walk through the poorer quarters of
the city brings one to this quaint waterway. The first sight of it at this point is not
particularly interesting. The buildings that line the banks are cheap and dirty and
altogether forbidding in appearance, but embark in one of the many boats lying along
the banks and take a trip up to the Headwaters at Lake Xochimilico and every foot of
the journey will ba full of interest. -
These boats are peculiar to the Viga. Flat-bottomed and unwieldy, they are
nevertheless capable of being propelled with a pole in the hands of an Indian at a
good rate. They are of ail grades, from the rough, un painted box-like affair, used for
carrying sand, to the elaborately decorated barge, capable of holding several people.
But the motive power in all is the sameâ an Indian and a poleâ and the prices of pas
sage range from 5 csnts to half a dollar, according to the distance traveled and the
style of boat used. Some boatmen will charge half a dollar an hour, but for that they
will paint the boat freshly and fill it with rugs of many colors until it looks like a
Venetian gondola. ; _
There is very little current in the Viga canal, as its source, Lake Xochimilico, is
only four feet above its termination, the two points being nine miles apart. As a
consequence, the expert Indian can "pole" the light boat almost as fast up stream as
down. Â ' w- *â â¢-â¢/:'- *t "'--'"
That part of the canal that passes through the city becomes more interesting as
the suburbs grow nearer. Picturesque buildings come close to the water's edge and
many quaint stairways, covered with soft green moss, wind upward among the most
mysterious looking structures. Color is everywhere.
As the boat is poled along, stirring up ripples that reflect the bright trees and
flowers that line the bank, the sensation is one of dazzling brilliancy. Other boats flit
by and their bright colors only add to the
indescribable confusion of reflections. The
sunshine is clear and br ght and the blue
sky over all is most suggestive ot the Med
iterranean. Surely, one thinks, this can
not be in America end only a three days'
journey from San Francisco!
As there is a little current in the Viga
the water is remarkably clear for a canal.
If it were not that the mud on the bottom
is constantly stirred up by the boatmen it
would be like crystal.
Out in the country the canal is a little
smaller than in the city and its banks are
simply the mud dredged from the bottom
piled on the sides. ; But the mud is covered
with a growth of grass and flowers, and
trees grow on both sides of the stream.
In one place the canal passes through an
avenue of palms as beautiful as anything
to be seen on top of the earth. The bright
green, fronded trees throw a most refresh
ing shade over the water arid are reflected
like emeralds on the clear, limpid surface.
About two miles above the town there
is what is known as the "resting place,"
hlthough why it should have been selected
in preference to many others is not quite
apparent. It is here that the boatmen tie
up and take their siesta, which, is some
times all day and sometimes many days in
succession, or as long as the beans and
tortillas last.' To see these boats lying
peacefully on 'the water one would not
think there was a living person near. But
look over the "gunwale, * and there on the
bottom, with tbo hot sun beating down on
bis upturned face, will he the owner,
sleeping the most contented sleep possible.
Of course a few of these boat-owners have
little adobe homes located not too far
from the canal, but tho greater number of
tbem live in their boats from year's end to
A VERITABLE DESERT IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO
The great desert of San Francisco. How incongruous the
words seeml As if there could be a desert in San Francisco.
But there is, and it is as wild a piece of land as can be found on
the face of the earth. It covers several thousand acres within
the city limits, and beyond that stretches away in solitary
grandeur into the hills of San Mateo County.
Most residents of this City will know that the, piece of land
referred to is that just south of Golden Gate Park, and say that
there is nothing remarkable about itâthat it is just the sand
hills that have been there all the time. These are people who
have seen the little sanddunes along the ocean drive, but have
no knowledge of what lies beyond. They probably think there
may be a few more dunes ]ust like them, possibly a few that are
even larger. *â '.'" *
A visit to this desert, for such it really is, will well repay
the effort required. To get into the heart of it is no child's
play, and a person not a good walker and climber must give up
all idea of ever doing so. 'Whoever should attempt it must
also be careful to select a fine, clear day, as it is possible for one
to get lost and wander about for hours should a fog come up.
It hardly seems credible that a person can get lost in a
wilderness 'within a big city and suffer all the hardships that
are supposed to belong to the outposts of civilization, but peo
ple have been lost there and in more than one instance the ex
perience has. resulted fatally. It is not so long bro that, a
woman from the Almshouse wandered into the desert and
being caught in a fog was unable to find her way back. She
was known to have left the institution at about noon and was
missed at supper time. Search was made for her about the
grounds, but it was not until the next day that she was found.
She was lying dead close to a clump of brush, and footprints in
the sand showed that she had wandered round and round in a
circle until overcome by exhaustion and cold. J rom the way the
sand was disturbed it was apparent that she had struggled
along for hours before being finally overcome.
-.". Of course such a tragic ending is not likely to come to a
young person in vigorous health, nevertheless it is a good idea
to take a compass when going into the desert. Fogs come up
Irom the sea in remarkably short order and then all landmarks
instantly disappear. The feeling when surrounded by the in
tangible vapor is a most unpleasant one and really is like being
confined in a dungeon. There are the walls on all sides only a
few feet away. But approach them and* they at once recede.
There is no way to get your beariugs. ; What you think is north
may be south, and if you ..walk in that direction you may be
facing the east or west in a very few minutes. The tendency to
travel in a circle at once asserts itself. You cannot : look bark
over your own trail for more than a few feet, as the fog ob
scures it. And so you will go round and round until the fog
lifts, or you accidentally strike some-landmark that will guide
you in the right direction. :-- However, as has been stated, there
is much of interest in the San Francisco desert, and if a clear
day is selected there is practically no danger of get tin.; lost.
Should all go well, few indeed are the nature-lovers who will
not derive pleasure from the trip, for if it is taken in the proper
way every moment some new beauty will be revealed and the
mysterious voices of the wilderness will sing new songs.
The most picturesque and interesting route to get into this
desert is by following the driveway that comes out of the park
near the pumping plant. About 500 feet out of the park the
road takes a sudden turn to the west, rising over a rather bar
ren looking knoll. On the other side lies the desert with its
mountains of sand stretching to the sea. "
The road wiuds in and out among a lew shanties and then
ends in a sandhill. It does not really end, it simply blends off
into nothingness. At this point the park is in plain sight and
the surroundings do not look entirely, unfamiliar, but the work
of getting into the desert has just commenced. Keep on over
the ridge and you will soon be cut of the world. ,
It is hard walking. The sand gives way beneath the foot,
and a few hundred yards are enough to put most people out of
breath. There are several nigh places to be crossed, but the
walking gets easier with each step. This is due to the fact that
the sand is packed harder in some places than others by the
action of the wind.
Over one hill and down another. Sights anti-sounds of
civilization gradually disappear until at last the traveler is
alone. 12 he has never been alone before he will know hat it
means now.
Standing on some of the highest sandhills it is possib'e to
look over a large area, and it is seldom that a human footprint
can be seen. In the very center of this region it is safe to say
that not ten people venture from year's end to year's end.
There is nothing to bring them there. Along the edges of the
desert, which is about half a mile from the park,- there are
few homes owned by people living' there for their health.
From the appearance of these places it is hard to believe they

year's end. To be sure the life is not what would be called luxurious, in the civilized
sense of the word, but the boat-owner certainly enjoys himself the greater part of the
time. All is not work in Mexico, you "know; and besides they have a great deal of
regard for "to-morrow," which is most effective in preventing fatigue.
In the summer time the boat-owner leads a jolly life. He does - but little work
possibly an hour or two in the forenoon. Then he cooks himself a light meal, rolls a
cigarette and goes to sleep in the bottom of his boat. What cares he how the sun
beats down or how the flies buzz. For him the heat is simply the warmth of paradise
and the buzzing of insects perhaps the singing of some celestial choir. - : â  -.-; .â¢"-,*" :-.*â  ,
All through the long afternoon he snores and dreams and when evening comes
prepares to attend a 'â¢biille 1 ' or dance. This is not much work, as his toilet is very

is that of the barren lands of Arizona. These ranches, as the
people call them, are comfortable enough, but living there
would seem to be like spending one's life out of the world. A
ranch owned by a man named: Carr is really a prosperous look
ing place. .The house is large and comfortable, but the sur
roundings are enough to make one die of lonesomeness. -
The little colony near the southwest corner of the park is,*

see it wonder why i those living there ever selected such a spot
for a residence, 'f And the people who live there are content to
let the other, people wonder, although -they do not object to
telling why. Go to the doors of any of the houses or street
cars, as lhe case may be, for many of the houses are old street
cars pressed into serviceâ and ask the owner why he lives there.
Only one answer will you get "Health." It is really true that
this bit of wild land is almost as curative to di-eased lungs as
any part of Arizona. In fact, to some of the few living, there it

have about the same

the winter noDody
ventures near and
in the summer most of the people pass without stopping. But
it is that portion of the desert far away from the edge, where
nothing can be seen but sand and sky, that is the most interest
ing.
In many parts of the desert there are acres and acres with
out the least sign of vegetation. Just the smooth rolling sand
that shows light against the dark blue sky, and has almost the
appearance of snow. The general color scheme is of alight
yellowish gray. Where vegetation does: exist it is so covered
with sand as to be scarcely distinguishable am id the general
monotonous tone.
The places where there 13 any vegetation to speak of are in
hollows between the sandhills, and to? some reason it grows
quite rapidly, although it is a mystery how it ever gets started.
It would seem as if the winter rains soaked in deeply and so
furnishea the necessary water for the warm days of summer.
Occasionally a patch a few hundred square feet in area can be
found that is a perfect oasi *.'.-. Grass grows, long and:: luxuriant,

how far the oasis might extend itself is a question that will
never be solved, for a peculiar phenomenon always wipes it out
of . existence. . The phenomenon is the ever-shifting sandhill.
The spots where the trees and weeds thrive for a short time are
always sheltered beneath a sandhill that eventually proves
their destruction. . The west wind from the sea, ever blowing,
picks up the sand on ; the upper slopes and causes it to roll
down the eastern side of * the hill. _; Consequently the hill is
always moving like a monster billow. As the sand rolls on to
the oasis it first covers the weeds and grasses and the lower
parts of the trees. Higher arid higher it climbs, at the same
time rolling eastward. ~
Soon half of the trees are covered, and frequently only the
upper branches of a tree can be seen pro truding from a smooth
stretch of sand without -anything to indicate where the roots
might he. Still the sand roll* along, higher ; and higher until
the last trace of the oasis is blotted from sight. While this is
going on in one place the dead branches of trees will be coming
to light ih another place. As the sand piles up on the eastern
CARR'S RANCH, ON THE EDGE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO DESERT.
side of the bill it naturally fo lows that it must go down at
some point further to the west. The dead trees that are thus
brought to light are the remains of an oasis that may have
flourished twenty years ago. And so it goes on year after year.
The wind builds one hill by tearing down another and obliter
ates one oasis that another may come into existence. The veg
etation that exists on the sheltered slopes is much the same as
can be found in the Mojave Desert. It is all of the same nature.
The desert sage is plentiful and seems to have the faculty of
keeping on top of the sandhill no matter bow high it grows.
Sometimes there will be a stretch of several acres of sand as
smooth as a floor with only a tiny bunch of gray creeper in the
center. Of birds arid animals few can be seen. - Occas-onally a
rabbit strays from somewhere to starve to death. Once in a
long while a seagull can be seen flying eastward at a great
height, as if on its way to the bay. But it might be said that
the desert is devoid of animal life.
*â '-.; There is no more desolate, spot on earth than the heart of
this region. Sand mountain after sand mountain rise on all
sides and stretch away in the distance until they melt in a soft
haze of pearly gray. The silence is almost absolute, except for
lying aroundâ there is not room enough in the boatâ so they have only one suit, and
wear it all the time. *".- _ .-.**â¢-"â¢_.'
The amount of money that these men earn is infinitesimally smallâ not over $100
a yearâ but most of them are absolutely happy, which after all may be the reason
that they add to the picturesqueness of the Viga canal. But why should not they be
happy? They have all they can eat and drink and all they wish to wear. Fatigue
and hardship are unknown to them. They work just enough to obtain the necessa
ries of life and the rest of their time they spend enjoying themselves in their own way.
A charming feature of the canal is the many bridges that span it. Some of these
are of wood and some of stone, but all are picturesque in the extreme. 'The stone ones

living from the canal. Her** they lead listless but easy and contented lives. ,

is a moan of madness as it rushes over the wastes carrying
myriads of particles that are dropped for a moment in a certain
spot, and then whirled on again until at last they find a resting
place where they must remain for ages. Hour after hour, day
after day, year after . year," -century alter century, the wind
sings its weird song in the desert.'
The lonesomeness cf many parts of this stretch of country is
appalling. There is nothing for the mind to grasp. On all sides
only an expanse of sand and above the impermeable, limitles**
sky. > Only a few weeds with the wind whistling through them
relieve 1 the eye, arid then the mind becomes oppressed with
jonging. There seems to be everything in the desert and there
seems to be nothing. There is everything, because there is
nothing to quicken the desires. Something is surely lacking,
that might puzzle a person when he experienced the lone
someness of the des-rt for the first time, but an old hunter
will tell you that it is the "want of companionship."
In spite of all its desolation there is much in the desert to
please an artist and enough material for hundreds of pictures.
What tender sunrises and what precious sunsets! What poet
ical moonlights. In fact every moment of the day is beautiful,
and to many the night wiil appear more beautiful.
In one sense the desert is at present a useless waste, but it
is not destined to remain so very long. The march of improve
ment is going that way and soon it will be cut up into building
lots. This knowledge may cause the nature lover, a3 he turns
his back upon the desert, a feeling of regret, which can only be
compensated by the knowledge that the innovation will mean
the greatest good to the greatest number.
On returning to civilization the feeling is an odd one. It
seems as though one had been to a far-away country for many
days. There appears to have been a great change in the peo
ple on the street, and the clang of the streetcar bell has a queer
tone. The mind seems crowded with ideas, and yet the day was
spent in looking at only sand, weeds and sky.

One of the most picturesque figures
among the many that congregate about
the corridors of the New York -hotels at
the present time is, perhaps, tbat of tbe
famous scout and warrior, the handsome
Brigadier-General William F. Cody.
He was, and is, a hero. When only a
boy, a mere lad, he was one of the first
riders of the pony express that was estab
lished to carry letters across the plains.
That was in 1860, and, when in 1863 he en
listed in the Seventh Kansas Cavalry, he
gained distinction and promotion for his
daring and fearless deeds. He served in
the late civil war until peace was de
clared. :i\: : J,l
Apropos, the sobriquet of "Buffalo Bill"
was earned by General Cody when in 1867
be entered into a contract with the Kansas
Pacific " Railway Company in Western
Kansas whereby he was to furnish all the
wild buffalo meat necessary as food for the
hundreds of laborers employed. In eigh
teen 1 months the record showed 4280 buf
faloes killed by Cody. From that time on
he was known as "Buffalo Bill."
, General Cody is in New York now be
cause his Wild West show is open at the
Madison-square Garden. As I looked into
General Cody's ruddy, healthy face the
other afternoon, I tried to find some trace
in the clearcut features that would tell in
some way the history of tie frightful In
dian massacres he had seen, or the tale of
his hand-to-hand conflict with the notori
ous Cheyenne chief, -Yellow Hand, whom
he killed in the Sioux war of 1876 but not
a sign remains. There is not one cruel
line in his face, and his splendid clear
eyes reveal no shadows of unhappy mem
ories. % ;â¢ Trella Foltz Tolahd.

Few people are aware that the Dowager-
Empress of Russia saved her husband's
life on two occasions. One day, when in
the Emperor's dressing-room, she observed
that on his dressing-table lay a curious
looking little jewel case; something about
it* appearance aroused her curiosity, and,
taking it up, she became aware that it
was extreme!* heavy. .Without saying a
word she went into her room, and placed
it carefully in a basin of water, then send
ing for the Prefect of Police, whose duties
kept him much about the palace, she asked
him- to have it examined: and it was dis
covered to be one of the most marvelous
infernal machines ever invented by the
ingenuity of -"man. The -second occasion
on which the Empress was directly instru
mental in stopping murder occurred in
the Winter Palace, when she heard a
slight noise, which indicated the presence
of some stranger in the Czar's study.
Without^ betraying the slightest anxiety
she begged her husband to come and
speak to one of the children. He did so.
She locked the door and only gave up the
key to a' party of soldiers, who found,
when they entered j the apartment, that
some one-had just escaped through the
window. *-'Â..'''ââ  â¢â¢-â  '.'â :'

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
FOR WEAKNESS OF MEN.
WHICH CURED HI M AFTER EVERY-
THING ELSE FAILED. * :.--^f"t
Palnfnl diseases are bad enough, hut when a
man is slowly, wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the mod severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental' suffering -day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
â¢uch a strain men are scarcely : responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of . poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential Inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man . who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now,' when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because 1 1 want : every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. >
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
offering -the mental tortures of ' weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could;
they but get such a remedy as | the one thai
cured me. Do not try to study out how I: can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information; but send for it ana
learn that there - are . a Â; few things on earth ;
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and: mean a life-
time of happiness f to ; most of - as. Write to

MINERS.
The recent rich strikes in the Gwin mine, in
the new 1300 and 1400 levels, continue to be
frequently discussed in mining circles. Itis
observed to have a twofold significance to
mother-lode mining. lis more general one
lies in its being the latest and the greatest
deep-mining development, and one calculated
to still further stimulate the era of deep min
ing which has just begun and to strengthen
â¢till more the confidence in mother-lode prop-'
erties. (..-_
It also has a local significance, apparently.
Between the Kennedy and the Utica is a six
teen or eighteen mile stretch of the mother
lode, on which are a good many located mines
and some quite valuable ones, but nothing
corresponding to tha deep values of these
great mines had been found. Toe Kennedy
is working in a good newly found ore body at
2300 feet and the Utica is down about 2000
feet. Tho Utica is in this gap, and the new
development in its depths seems to connect
the Utica and Kennedy and to indicate that
the deep-lying values of these may be fairly
continuous alor.jj that section of the lode and
bÂ» encountered iv other places. ,
The discovery is that of a thin vein of won
derfully rich ore running through a ledge of
low-grade ore 12 to 14 feet thick. In places
the vein matter appears almost pure gold, at
lecst running ir.to the thousands per ton, and
it will give a high average to the whole ledge.
The vein has been traced for a considerable
distance and Us continuation in depth is ol
course problematical. A new deep shaft will
be sunk at once a little farther south aid sixty
stamps will be added to the present new forty
stamp mi.L The property consists of four ad
joining locations along the lode. During the
career of the mine before the abandonment of
operations many years ago the old shaft was
sunk to 1200 feet and some $3,000,000 was
taken from the comparative short tunnels
run at various levels. Owing to the trouble
with water and the crude and expensive
methods then employed the profits became
little or nothing and operations ceased just
above the iiches that have now been found.
The new shaft has been sunk 200 feet below
lhe old one, and in time the old workings will
be drained through this shaft. When this i.
done and the third shaft driven, there will be
three shafts and a vast ore body in sight that
could not be worked out in two generations, be
sides the unmeasured promises of riches deeper
down. This mine, which wa. bonded two"
years ago for $200,000, now takes its place as
one of the greatest and richest mines of
California, with a probable value of millions.
And there is a certainty that there are other
.(Vinson the mother lode.
During this week the executive committee
ol the California Miners' Association will meet
to consider the question of participation in
the gold mining convention to be held in Den
ver, July 7, 8 and 9. Many of the leadlnj
mining men of this State will attend this im
portant gathering in which California has as
much interest as any State.'-. The official call
for the convention has reached various offi

The objects of tbe convention are to secure snch
National legislation as may be calculated to pro
ir.o c the business Interests and development of
the resources of the mining Industry in North and
t-outh America: to bring- together mining men
and Investors; to increase reciprocal trade among
tbem: t. discnss mch questions as are naturally
suggested bi- its objects; to cultivate acquaintance,
crn al feeling and hear co-operation among
the various miuin., commercial and labor bodies
represented, and pet-lull.* to lake under advise
ment the Importance of the creation by Congress
of a department to be known as the Department
oT Mines anl Mining, thus* securing a Cabinet
officer that represents an interest which affects
more than one-third of the people of the United
States..-*?;,'*' "
It Is hoped that this convention will prove to be
the creates*, and most effective effort ever made in
tbe Interest of mining, therefor* the Governors of
States and Territories, friendly nations, County
Commissioners, Mayors of cities and towns, all
mining, commercial, trade and la*>or organizations
are urged to take bo of the matter, at once, and
no: only see that their delegates are appoin ed and
attend the convention, but that attractive and
thoroughly educational displays of minerals are
made from every mining district.
NODDING POPPIES.
The executive committee solicits proposals of
subjects wh'ch may be embraced In a programme
now being prepared.'/ . 4 . 'â¢.._'
At midnight of next Tuesday the new State
| mining law relating to locations, registration,
I etc., goes into effect. After that time every
locator of i a quariz claim must do $50 worth
of assessment;, work within sixty days, white
$10 worth of work must be done on a placer
claim. New requirements as to posting notices
of location must be observed, and on that day
I the books of all district recorders will be
i closed to be turned over to cjunty recorders
i within thirty days. Hereafter all mining lo
' cations mnst be registered with the Recorder
! of the county. These and other provisions of
j the mining laws passed at the last session of
| the Legislature may work some annoyance
! and uncertainly for a time, but the laws are sa
; lutary Ones though capable of the improvement
I they will likely get at the next session of the
i Legislature, lt will not now be possible for
an enterprising prospector to file twenty or
; thirty locations and hold thorn for a year with
| out a dollar of expense.
The pending new trouble between the Anti-
Debris Association and the Nevada County
miners, caused by the Injunction suits against
i the owners of two gravel mines on account of
j ground sluicing, bids fair to be adjusted by
j calling off the officials of the debris associa
i tion. The committee from the Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce which went to Nevada
City to inspect the Coding and Goodwin mines
seems Inclined to smooth things down, and it
has filed the following report to the Chamber
of Commerce: :,V ...
"We recommend that further proceedings in
the court be stayed and that the honorable
Board of Public Works, or competent engi.
neers, be selected by the Anti-Debris Associa
tion and the State Miners' Association, said
board to.be requested to make a thorough in
vestigation of the whole matter and report to
ihe above associations. , f._-. .j"
"We further recommend that the Anti-Debris
Association, before it lakes decisive action,
await the result of investigation, which will
snow the true state of affairs. We believe that
by so doing this important question will be
adjusted upon an equttab'e basis within the
laws, with the least possible friction between
the interests icvoived at a mimlmum cost.'.'
There have been no other definite develop
ments during the week. /
"Official" reports on the Yukon diggings are
somewhat new. They have heretofore con
sisted of prospectors' tales painted red. j The
Candian Inspector of Police of that region has
made one, and in the course of it he says that
a large seam of good soft coal lies about ten
miles from Forty-mile Creek, with about
j 200,000 tons in sight, and that it will' proba
j bly become the chlel fuel supply of that re
j gion. Without question rich quartz lodes,
i from which the gold in the creeks has come,
I will be discovered before long, to be developed
when transportation facilities make it possi
: ble to get mining machinery Into that almost
inaccessible region. Wben that time comes a
! coal supply will be Invaluable. The inspector
last year spent $9000 of his collections of
mining fees on trails on the Canadian side of
the boundary, which illustrates the difference
between the governmental policies of the two
Governments, the United, States not having
yet even supplied police protection on the
American side. The inspector urges the open
ing up of a route from British Columbia on
the south.
In Colorado the Commissioner of the Mining
Bureau is having a complete survey of the
Cripple Creek mining district made, and will
issue an official bulletin giving the geological
formation of the district, the history of the
camp and detailed information about the
mines, etc. 'I? _r.; '?â¢â¢_.
The latest Colorado sensation is the new
town of Yale City, a week old. Recent strike*
in the Cottonwood mining district near Buena
Vlsia have created an excitement and a rush,
and now, while the first tents are going up,
"it is predicted" that Yale City will be a

world's demand is rapidly* increasing. One of
the discoveries is that of water which assays
twenty pounds of -copper to ; 200; gallons.
Recently a member; of -the '-United States
Geological Survey who examined the Montana
copper belt" said that it was an open question
whether the copper washed away in the water

The copper, development in Shasta County
goes rapidly on.*-. At Keswick, tho Mountain
Copper Mining J Company will have five new
smelters going before long. A mile from the
smelter is the idle Mammoth quartz mine, and
It is now to be reopened to supply the copper
company with fifty tons of ore dally for flux
for the smelters. An endless ropeway will
transport the ore. Many other quartz mines
in that region are supplying ore for flux. In =
this county, the Evening Star quartz mine has'

GEETNA GEEEN'S BLACKSMITH.
Death of the -Last of the Men Who Made
.the Scottish Town Famous. â  -?! â¢ â '-'â 
Few spots in the United Kingdom are
possessed of more romantic interest than
Gretna Green, on the Scottish bor
der, where, according to local rec
ords, more than 10,000 runaway mar
riages have been celebrated. According to
Scotch law, says the New York World, an
acknowledgment before witnesses that a
woman was one's wife constituted a legal
marriatre, and so runaway couples made
their way from all parts of England to
Gretna Green, where they would acknowl
edge themselves to be man and wife at the
smltny in the presence of the blacksmith,
who would take h<s position behind the
anvil, repeat a short prayer and give them
his blessing and a certificate. â  - * *
Some time a_o an act of Parliament' was
passed forbidding these Gretna Green
marriages unless the parties had resided
three weeks in; Scotland, and Great Brit
ain marriages will soon be a thing of the
past. William Ling died recently. Old
Lang, who recently celebrated his eigh
tieth birthday, was tbe last of four gen
orations of these marrying blacksmiths.
Among those who have been wedded by
the Langs have been the Earl ol Dundon

Miss Barnes, and Lord " Ers'tine, : who
posted all the way from London to the
Scottish border with Sarah Buck.i*, -**'â¢;

Of Ancient Origin.
Those Americans who dislike the an
them "America" on the. ground that is
founded on the British national anthem
will be interested to, know tbat James
P&yn has suggested the abolition of "God
Save the Queen" as a happy way of com
memorating the Queen's Diamond Jubi
lee. Mr. Payn's quarrel is with the words,
however, and not with the music. He
complains: "The words .have not even
the merit of an English origin. Raikes
informs us in his journal that they are al
most a literal translation of tbe antique
song sung by the Demoiselles de St. Cyr,
when Louis XIV attended the chapel of
that establishment, and were translated
and adapted to the House of Hanover by
Handel." There can be no objection to
the music, which Beethoven himself
called "a treasure."â -Philadelphia Press.

The ( other evening there was quite a
number of well-known San Franciscans in
the dining-room. Among them most con
spicuous was George F. Crocker, who has
recently returned from a trip West. He
was accompanied by James B. Brady, the
wealthy iron 5 contracior, i famous for his
wonderful collection of diamonds. There
are diamonds set in I his cane*! and um
brellas, hot only in the handles but deep
in the ferrules and along the outside sur
faces. His ( cardcase, cigar-case, match
box, watch and chain,' keyring and note
book are set with immense diamonds of
the purest water. .
, They say he carries a lot of . unset dia
monds about with him. just to shake in
the palm of his hand like so many dice.
There is a good story told about Mr.
Brady and an indignant hotel clerk in St.
Louis which caused, much merriment at
the time.
Mr. Brady's shirt is always adorned
with diamond cufflinks, collar-buttons
and studs, besides the sparkling Dejeweled
buckles and gold chains which adorn his
white silk braces. As is his 'wont Mr.
Brady carelessly removed his shirt on pre
paring to retire for the night, and, throw
ing on a bis ulster, went down to the
office and Hung the laundered, cambric
down on the desk, saying: "Please put
tbat in the safe and give mi a receipt."
The clerk looked at him in open-eyed
astonishment, exclaiming:- "Excuse me,
sir, but we do not keep a safe as the re
ceptacle for Boiled linen."
"You won't keep it for me until morn
ing, eh?" asked Brady. \ â¢â â â  :^-S?,v
"No, sir!" returned > the clerk with in
dignant voice. "^\
"Well, don't you think you'd better?'
said Brady, with , a sly wink, and broad
smile, as he turned the shirt over and ex
posed to view the immense diamond'
gleaming around the collar and down the
front. It took the clerk three long min
utes to recover from his surprise and ad
miration of the dazzling gems.
It goes without saying that the clerk
found a place in the safe for the precious
shirt, and that Brady smile 1 good natur

BLAO__ ANIMALS.
Awful Examples of Sable-Coated Leo-

"Beware oi black animals" is consid
ered sound advice by a magazine writer
who devotes six pages and numerous illus
trations to warnings against the awful
examples of black animals, leopards,' cats,
ravens, beetles and undertakers' horses.
â  The black leopard is admitted to be the
most savage and intractable of all quadru
peds. The borrib black leopard Death
i;i Eugene Sue's "Wandering Jew." who
was followed about , by. a loathsome Eng
lishman, anxious to see him eat his

overdrawn ", when compared with 1 the
black : leoDard â¢ now in â¢ the zoological
gardens â Satan by name. â¢ Satan I hates
the whole world and wants to fight.it,
to gnaw it, to tear it to rags and splinters;
and he is staring, dancing mad because he
can't get the world to do it. He lies there,
black and deadly, ; his yellow eyes ablaze,
ready to pounce on youâ if only thoÂ«e bars
suddenly melt away! But they don't melt
and you come no; nearer. Then Satan
flings nimseit at the bars with a yell and
flies up and down and over, and over
about his cape like nothing but a black
ieopard with about SOCCseiiiilz powders,
wallowed separately ana . suddenly effer
vescing ail together inside him.
"He claws and b tes tat the walls,' the
bars, the floor, even hi* own tail and feet,
in frantic rage at his inability lo get near
you. And '< finally he rolls over on his
back, half choking, and crunches in his
teeth a mouthful of straw snapped from
the ground, just to make you understand
want would; happen to your head if it
were where the straw if. And altogether
Satan's manners are not of a patient and
long-suffering : ';; sort.". : .Th.' neighboring
lions and tigers are comparatively soft
hearted. ; * '" y. 'â 'â '.' -Ââ¢>â *._
â  The raven is another ..*'bl__ck rascal."
He is "sinister, sly, melancholy and grim
visaged," although " mischievous.' Yet
there are people.-.who .keep- .ravens., a.
pets. Dickens had one, from. whom Grip,
the famous raven" in 1 "Barnahy P.udge,"
was drawn and- who died "from eat
ing â  white taint, anything even so dis
tantly approaching necessarily dis
agreeing; with him. Undeterred from
rayen-keeping the uovelist invested in an

NEW DIVING MACHINE.
It May Bring: About Â». Revolution Ib
Submarine Work. .
The first of a very â¢ simple \ and easily
constructed combined diving* apparatus
and life-saving raft was completed last
week by John Cur tin, under a patent
granted to John Speirs of Jersey
Heights. ,:,. /.._>-,/ j ."":â¢.'.. â  'â â¢'
- Thi3 machine allows a workman to de
scend in the water to the bottom of a ves
sel and yet have a free and open com
munication with the air above while he per
forms needed work under the light of - an
electric lamp. Then the apparatus, when
not in use, can be folded like an accordion
â into a small, space, and can in case of
need be inflated with air and used as a
life raft. Â' â¢\.:,vv -.vi-Vn â >â¢...- :_.;â¢.,;Â»â¢ Â»â Â£;'s&â  '.â¢;â '.'
The machine consists of a hollow cylin
der a yard in diameter, made of: strong
waterproof canvas and of sufficient length
to reach to the underside of the -vessel
using it, while its open upper end is
above water. This long waterproof bag
is held distended by hickory boons pass
ing arouna its inner circumference
about two feet apart. It is provided
with a light metal bottom, from which
along its length, with guides at the tot*, are
extended supporting ropes. On one side of
this cylinder, at the height of a man's
shoulders from the bottom, are placed, on
the outside, water-tight sleeves and gloves,
into which a man on the inside can thrust
his arms and hands so as to be able to
freely handle tools. Immediately. above
these appendages, so as to be opposite the
workman's face, is a glass window,' through
which he can see by means of a light from
a submerged electric lamp. - â¢*:>â¢.
If repairs aro needed at tbe bottom or
side of a vessel, below the water, line,. tbe
diving apparatus can be sunk or drawn to
th** desired point by a rope fastened to its
bottom and passing under the craft, its
upper open end being above tbe water line.
This prevents to the diver a clear, well-ven
tilated channel, into which he can descend
by means of a rope ladder. When stand
ing on the bottom be can thrust his hands
into the pending sleeves, grasp tools sus
pended on the outside, and perform the
needed work with almost as much comfort
as though the vessel was in a drydock.
There is not needed heavy diving armor,
pumps, uncertain tubes for air, great at
mospheric pressure and lite-lines; but the
workman can directly communicate with
his companions above and go back and
forth at pleasure,' with but little trouble.'
â¢ These cylinders, 5 which' admit of close
compression, will occupy but little space
when, stored,', and yet in a few seconds
time can be converted into. flrst-class life
saving rafts, similar to some now in use.
When one of them is inflated with air the
upper end securely closed by a cover pro
vided for the purpose, it will possess great
buoyancy and be capable of supporting
Considerable weight. .:. ..;..,- _>.:<.
; Then, if two or more of them are lashed

FASHION FADS
AND FANCIES.
The country is now so beautiful that we
daily discuss plans for coaching, garden
and house parties that will take place in
the near luture. Lovers of tha water are
no less enthusiastically arranging for
many a long cruise. So truly the summer
girl's wardrobe becomes more and more
complicated, for not only must she have
a full supply of pretty house dresses, and
yet more lovely hues for the evening, but
if she plays golf and tennis, rows and
swims, she must have a special costume
for each and every occasion.
fipass Linen.
For those who cannot afford a great va
riety of summer frocks, let me advise
them to invest in grass linen, made over
either a good quality of satin or a soft
finished taffeta. The skirt should have
two bands of lour-inch-wide embroidery.
Raised embroidery upon lace will be most
beautiful, but I cannot say it will be rea
sonable in price, quite the contrary. Two
similar bands run around the waist, de
scribing semicircles back and front. Two
are likewise applied on the sleeves, which
are finished with a full double frill of lace
tbat exactly matches the insertions. This
edges them also, and is gracefully jarboed
down the left side of the bodice. Black
moire velvet finishes the neck and encir
cles the waist. The velvet is cut on the
bias, and is allowed to wrinkle prettily.
A black hat, with three Prince of Wales
plumes at one side and resting next the
hair flowers that either match or offer a
good contrast to the silk foundation, will
be found extremely stylish and will prop
erly complete the toilette.
Such a dress will not cost less than $75
or $100 if fine lace and insertion are used,
but it will take the place of several white
flower-sprayed muslins and organdies, be
sides cheaper materials can be used. One
such costume worn by a stylfsh New York
girl bas both a scarlet and a bright green
slip, which make a welcome change. In
the end this model frock will prove au ex
cellent investment.
Black, in High Favor.
"When combined and made over some
bright color or over white for those in half
mourning:, one can wear handsome grena
dines or etamines over white silk, and the
colors most in favor are cerise and green,
the bright grassy green being strikingly be
coming to some complexions. Mandarin
orange having a dash of red in it is decid
edly stylish as a foundation, but unfortu
nately few find it becoming.
The .Moujik..
Bo great is the demand for new tailor
made models that when the moujik made
its debate at Sundown It caused a pleasur
able sensation and at once became fash
ionable, for it is a bodice copied from the
Russian coat. It fastens at the left side,
is confined at the waist line with a hand
some belt, below which extends a basque.
It is very slightly pouched, and is so cut
at the neck that an undervest is seen.
Sometimes the basque Is cut in tabs.
Rich silk is used for lining, and no
prettier style could have been devised for
the double width cashmere cloth which
will doubtless be u-_ea extensively during
the next year or more. These fabrics are
twice the weight of the old-style ones tbat
so easily became rumpled. The new
weaves are certain to be warmly wel
comed, now that they have reached such
a state of perfection, and the lighter the
weight of cloth that can be successfully
bandied by the tailors the better, as now
we walk, most of us, considerable dis
tances, and so should avoid carrying
around any extra pounds of clothing.
Tiie Cape of Clothing.
At this season of the year many gowns

can be laid away until next fall and â _ the
careful matron and maid will examine
critically each garment before shutting it
up in her trunk, or drawer, as the case
may be, for it will save time and money
in the end, if such things as require to be
cleaned or dyed are attended to at once.
At all events allow nothing ;to remain
dusty or stained, as a little attention only
is required to remove either. Skirts hav
in.* but a spot or two are sent
home by the good cleaner in per.
feet condition, whereas if allowed
to remain soiled they may be quite ruined.
Strict attention to all the minor details of
a woman's d robe consumes an immense
amount of time unless done systemati
cally, for delicate vests of mouiselinÂ«> de
soie or lace have constantly to be renewed
or sent to the cleaners and innumerable
are the stitches required if gloves, skirts.

number of literary and business women
who find it impossible to attend to such
things themselves that there is
a company managed on the same
lines as the "Gentleman's Renovating

at its top a short aicrette rises. V-.i.;

gloves:" "It is" quite 'impossible, now that
the 'sleeves c.me so , far down . over the
hands and fit so tight about , the wrist, to
wear the long g'oves, and the mousque
taires which have been' in favor â¢so long
are uncomfortable and bulky 'with' almost
all the new gowns and jackets that have
the new sleeves.' â  One-button gloves can
not be said to have met with universal
approval, 1 but are occasionally worn. Tne
length, however, is equal to. that of 'a
two-button glove. Two buttons bave
this season quite ' superseded the three
and four, but they also . are I longer, than
two- button gloves were made formerly.
Heavy kid* and .'dog-skin are generally
used for them, as they * are, as a rule,
street gloves. For summer wear i there *is
one style of â  wbite suede - made on th.
same lines, and* a 'heavy white glace kid
with' heavy j stitching is also worn with
wash gowns. White glace,' two. three and
even four button heavily stitched gloves
are yet in favor for smart occasionsâ call-
ing, receptions, etc. [These gloves can only
be worn once without looking soiled, par
ticularly if worn with dark gowns or
wrapsâ even the utmost circumspection
when wearing them does not seem to be
of much â¢ avail."' In consequence 'many
women prefer the black suede, which cer
tainly are more economical, and yet are
not so effective." Marcella.

gold is to figure largely in all trimmings

that you are going to have silver and gold

gold than 'silver, or you will be un
fashionable. . ,'
,Woman"has long been credited with an
overweening fondness for a uniform, the
result of the gold lace . that makes ,it gor
geous. "Now woman is to wear that which
she most admires, and we may expect to
see semi-military and semi-nautical .cos
tumes on all sides. This will particularly
be the case in the reefer suits, which are
bound to ibe .very popular. For tailor
made dresses there are many patterns in
blacK braid edged with gold cord. There
are zou.Tves'of every shape, kind and de
sign. Some of these are cut in a point in
the center of tue back, with gold fringe
appended which readies to the waist.
There are galons with gold cloth down
the center and bead embroidery of gold on
either side.
When gold is not in favor steel is. It is
not only employed as embroidery, but cut
steel brooches and buttons j and steel
clasps and slides figure on thing

and toques, and many ;of the new-fash

_" The very latest gown, the one which the
truly fashionable have indorsed, is of
string colored canvas made up over green
silk, the foundation and the* skirt -being
quite distinct. This opens to show a nar
row front formed of three flounces of the
canvas with a deep green ribbon hemmed
in, and the "entire depth : , closely , kilted,'

pale green mingling with the collar
and the waistband. Â .-.,-'.. ',

to the elbow and has a roleau about two
inches from the waist. The bodice is the
most original feature of all. It is com
posed of printed mousseline de sole, the
ground cream but little seen and almost
every color, appearing in the pattern. It
is made up over pink silk, and this very
thin, filmy fabric forms enormous puff
ings to the ' ruffled sleeve. Round the
waist are three bands of black velvet, held
in by very ornamental buttons set in with
some' pretty but not costly ornamenta
tions, something that will take the blue of
the silk muslin.
A much simpler 'gown than the one
described is of fawn canvas made up on
the foundation and bordered on the loot
with scrollwork of narrow silver braid.
The body shows open - work squares,
worked in gold to match. A high bodice
in the fashionable deep rose. glace shot
with white has a series of waved, converg
ing lines or narrow white insertion, start
ing from the shoulders and forming points
down tbe front only a few inch's apart,
embroidered at each end with black and
pink*, silkâ certainly a V most original
bodice. Tne coloring of this . is rather
newer. tban the old pink, for it has a dash
of flame color in it. 'â¢.'-.
Although many of the new dresses have
narrow, all-round basques these are gen
erally ' surmounted j by a | belt, ' either of
gold or silver galon, worked with tinsel
thread or turquoise, or some of . the many
paste gems more liberally used just now
than is .altogether consistent with good
taste." The ;a#.ntlon of the fashionable
woman must be "directed this year to
turquoises and beautiful - boleros, the
waist belts of a grassy green coloring are
studded closely with them. .In the case
in question it is 'most difficult to tell
whether the stone is green or blue, the
green foundation intensifying that color

' One of the most effective ornaments for
tbe hair that promises to be popular this
season is made out of two outstretched
bird's wings of iridescent green, with a
small cluster of roses at their ' base.
Rumor has it that the turban is to be re
vived. â ". The idea ?ia received with de
cided favor. Although this species of
headgear is not generally becoming, it is
delightfully convenient to wear. 'â¢ So I
think I can safely say the turban is to be
with us at least to a limited extent. .
Moire is again to be in universal iavor.
The silicon fringe which was wont to deco
rate the black silk dresses in the olden
days is also ito be worn. - Tbi3 . fringe,
which is half an incb in" width, made of i
silk, appears on many of the v newest
models in- triple rows around the skirt"
and trimming the sleeves. It is also to
be seen ,- in decorative combination with
crepe de chine, and; crepe de chine makes
many of the prettiest sashes when it bears
a knotted silk fringe at A the ends.*
The embroideries for \ the '\ fronts ' of
gowns this coming season are beautiful.
Some â¢ onllisse- and net are worked in. the
corners with light .floral patterns, which
are made right and left so that one or two
can be used. .... these green * and pink
tinsel and paillettes of faint tone miriKl,
with gold, silver and pearls _or something
of that nature. The bodice trimmings for
evening are nearly of the stomacher
shape, continued at the top as lar as the
shoulders. They , are worked also :in
paillettes, j jewels and tinsel thread, so
that the material of the dress shows in
the interstices.-' The boleros frequently
cover the backhand are continued under
the arms for high and low dresses'. ._
As a matter of fact, the styles quoted
j are , not ironclad and the would-be fash
i ionable may vary from t"e idea in minor
i ways all she wishes to. The more we in
vestitcate the new styles the more we find
they fairly smother us witn ideas. Again
it is made evident that we can be both
economical and fashionable.

The arrow files with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve boors. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso

word "high" means high barometric pressure and

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington

but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of

able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer i
westher may be expected in summer and colder j

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MARKET. )
The following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by E. a. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker, 412 Pine street.
San Fbaitcisco, May 22, 1897.
Chicago.
A bullish wave seemed to have come over the
slumbers of wheat speculators during tbe night,
The' feeling at yesterday's close was decided y
weak. July opened at 71Â©71VsC. Liverpool
cables were steady. The French flour market
fractionally lower, with wheat unchanged from
.final Quotations yesterdsy.
Wheat acied weak dur."ng the first few minutes
of the sssion. after which a stronger feeilng pre
sented Itself. St. Louis reported 45,000 bushels
w eu taken for France for immediate shipment
After this came private cables reporting conditions
throughout trance as growing worse. Excessive
rains have caused wheat fields to become badly
foul. -lhcse reports were somewhat of an alarm
ing character. At all events, many shorts covered
their lines, preferring to even up over Sunday
The most remarkable feature in regard to t' ese
damage reports is that French markets are lower
for flour and only steady for wheat. It has b.en
generally known that more or less damage has re
in.ted to the French wheat crop, some authorities
placing the shortage at 100.000.0u0 bushels while
others bought 50.000.000 bushels.
.The most critical period has yet to come. Judo
and July. are the trying months for wheat in
France. Later on French crop conditions will
have much to do in shaping prices on this side.
Hoports received to-day are not looked upon *as
sincere.' Other news was about evenly divided.
Nor.hwestern receipts continue heavy. â¢ Demand
for cash wheat was fairly good to-day. Exports
were not as heavy as during the previous three
days. Â»'â¢.: - ..v.

A BUDDHIST
CRITICIZES
PREACHERS
Reply of the Brahmacharin
to a Christian Min
ister.
HE SAYS THAT ORIEN
TALS KNOW CHRIST.
And That Occidental Interpre
tation of the B.b.e Is
Wrong.
HINDUS BELIEVE IN THE
TRINITY.
Cases in Which Idolatry Shou'd B.
Tolerated and a Philosophical
Reason Why.
There appeared in the columns of The
Call on Saturday, May 15, an article from
the pen of a reverend gentleman, in
which the writer finds fault with the teach
ings of my friend Anagarika H. Dharma
paia, and asks him and all of us who are
now working in different parts of the
United States to return to India, leaving
the Christians to their own faith.
While I have no intention to controvert
what the gentleman says, I consider it
fair on my part while I am bere to put
clearly before the public our position as
workers in the helping of humanity.
The lack of information on the part of
otherwise well-eaucated Americans con
cerning almost all questions relating to
India â excepting, perhaps, those that
have any bearings on commerce and
money-making â so great that they are
often most hopelessly confused whenever
they have to deal with such questions.
The writer of the article above alluded to
is at least in this plight. Though a min
ister of a great religion he hardly seems
to know the distinction between Brah
manism and Buddhismâ such as exists at
least in the outer forms.
My object, however, in writing this is
neither to make this distinction clear to
the publicâ a distinction which, I say, is
only apparentâ nor to defend the faiths ol
India, which to-day give satisfaction both
to the head and heart of the greater part
of humanity, including some of the bright
est minds of Europe and America. All
I have to say is only to clear our position
here in this country.
In the first place we have come here,
none of us as lar as I know, on our own
account. I know my friend Anagarika
H. Dharmapala was sent for by Dr. Paul
Cams of Chicago. Mr. Gandhi, who rep
resents here the Jama community of
India, was also invited by his friends in
America to come here ana work. The
Swami vivefcananda and his friends were
also invited guests of some thoughtful
Americans, while my poor self is here on
the request of friends in Chicago.
Thus coming, we never seek to
proselytize. Nothing is farther from our
motives and more repugnant to our minds
than that we consider it a great sin to
speak evil of any religion whatever, so
long as it uplifts a single soul from the
dust of the selfish earth. And all re
ligions can do it more or less. There are
pious men and women in all countries.
We tell such persons to follow their own
religion as long as they are satisfied with
it. Man's salvation is not through what
he believes, but what he knows and what
he does.
Belief in a particular doctrine, especial
ly wben it rests on blind faith merely, is
of little consequence, If, therefore, a per
son acts unselfishly, from a pure motive,
it does not matter what bis faith is. Let
him work righteousness and seek truth
honestly and gradually the time will
come when he will no longer be satis
fied with any form of belief resting on the
teaching of others. He will seek truth for
himself and know it at first hand. ' ' '.
Till that point is reached what is the
use of substituting one doctrine for an
other? Will the belief in a particular
dogma save him ? Not only iB it useless to
try to preach new dot-mas to those who
are satisfied with their faith, but in so
doing we do them positive harm by speak
ing evil of their cherished ideas. The

true teacher leads his disciples to the goal
through the very faiths they have.
He fans the spark of devotion that i" in
their heartsâ in whatever form it may
be into a great flame which illuminates
their souls ana burns up all the supersti
tions and; erroneous notions they might
have bad. We, therefore, never say any
thing against the faith of the Christian.
On the contrary, we ask him the more to
follow Christ, who was one of the noblest
of divine teachers that ever blessed the
earth.
Our mission is to reach those who. are
no longer satisfied with the accepted
dogmas of the church. : And there are
many such persons, specially among' the
thoughtful and intelligent classes. It is
they who have passed out of the grasp of
the clergy, who have held oat so long be
fore them a religon restine merely on as
sertion, and which is as different from the
teachings of the Christ as darkness from
light.
To such we preach ; and even then only
when we are asked. At least that is my
position. I know it was the position of
my friend, Swami Vivekananda. -For we
never believe in casting pearls before the
swine; and in so doing we only follow the
Christ. While we are perfectly willing to
help any one we can and are constantly
seeking the opportunity to do so, we are
wise enough to understand the laws of
human nature, which is not always ready
to listen to what you have to say." There
fore we preach only when the soul is ready
to receive. *..â¢*'_-
And how? Do we preach against Chris
tianity to those even who are no longer
believers in it? At least I do not. No
one of my hearers can ever say that I have
spoken against the Christ and Christ an
ity any more tban against my own relig
ion. Ol course I always condemn the
corruptions and degradations of the teach
ings of Christ. But I do the same with
the corruptions and degradations that are
now prevalent in my own country.
Christ was a divine teacher on earth.
And how can I, find fault with him or his
teaching, even when speaKing to persons
who no longer believe in him? There are
some in the Western world, both in Eu
rope and America, who are so disgusted
with the perversion of the teaching of
Christ that they would not under any cir
cumstances lis en to anything that comes
to them in the Christian form. I have
come across such persons; and, strange
to say, some of these anti-Christians ..re
sons of the clergy. It is to them alone
that I have sought to present our ideas
purely from the Indian standpoint. Ex
cepting those, to all my listeners I have
tried, and I know some of my friends have
tried, to speak through the Christ whether
they are any longer Christians or not. '-â â 'â¢" -
I have told them :
1. That the doctrine of Trinity, which
tbey have discarded, or have failed to un
derstand rationally, is one of the most
profound and sublime doctrines that has
ever been known.
2. That the idea of consubstantiation â
that is the three persons of the God
bead are one and of tbe same substance â
is just as philosophical and as scientific
as the previous one.
3, That the Son of Manâ the Christâ
really sacrificed himself for the world,
and shared its sorrows and sufferings out
of love.
And so on with the rest of the doctrines
of the Christian religion.
But we tell tbem these things not on
mere authority and as assertions. We ex
plain the reason and the philosophy of
the whole teaching the loss of which on
tbe part of tbe ministers of the faith who
have got only the milk suitable for the
babe, and not the strong meat whicb Si.
Paul and all tbe immediate disciples of
Christ kept for the chosen few, has made
the Christian religion a stumbling-block
an inexplicable something to the
thoughtful mind. In fact, there is
not a single doctrine that is essential in
Christianity from the idea of Trinity to
tbat of vicarious atonement, which we
Brahmins do not and cannot uphold on
philosophical grounds, though our ex
planations of such doctrines differ as
widely from those of the innumerable
denominations of Christendom which are
always quarreling, one with the other
as to ibe meaning of the Bible, as the ex
planation, say, of the formation of a
planet by a scientist differs' from the
crude notion of the same on the part of a
savage.
Why should we go to the European or
American of the modern time for the ex
planation of the Bible and the teachings
of Christ? The Bible is an Oriental book
and Christ was an Oriental. And we have
no necessity to put on occidental' specta
cles to read their teachingsâ a fact only
to distort the original view. We go to the
Christ direct and take the Bib in band
as it is, and we find in it the same idea as
has been taught by the sages of India.
Why should we then take exception to
the teachings of Christianity? We would
not do so even if it would be different
from what we are taught.
j We Hindus are liberal and charitable
enough to tolerate the honest views of
others, however crude tbey may be.
We in India are taught that every. man
must have his own religion. And any
one of us can be an orthodox Hindu, be
lieving anything honestly, even atheism
and nihilism, as long as he observes cer
tain rules of conduct, rules which are ab- j
solutely necessary for the keeping to
gether and progress of society. We tole
rate even image worship in any iorm
when the worshiper cannot honestly!
comprehend anything better. We demand
from such a worshiper that he should
thoroughly practice what he believes and
that he must sacrifice himself at every
step. We do not quarrel with his idola
try even if it is so in every sense of the
word. For we are all idolators and image
worshipers as long as we worship in any
form. Form necessarily implies limita
tion, and all limitation with regard to
God is idolatry. It is therefore a question
of degree and not of kind. Some worship
mental images; others physical; that is
all the difference,' therefore we do not
quarrel. . . ,:; . : .::;
Liberality and charity is our law, even
when we find people believing things
which we know to be untrue, all the time
seeking the opportunity to correct their
ideas in the proper way. Much less,
therefore, should we quarrel with the
Christ in whose teachingsâ the essential
ideas of Christianityâ let me repeat, .we
recognize the same truth as we are taught
in India. What we find fault; with" and
try to correct is the misinterpretation,
misrepresentation and corruption of them.
1 have no time nor intention, however,
to explain the teachings of Cnrist here
from the Hindu standpoint. But let me
assure the reverends ministers of Christi
anity that we can and do accept all the
essential teachings of Christ, though all
the while remaining most orthodox
Hindus. And we try to reach only those
who are not any longer satisfied with the
religion of the church and seek truth from
other sources. And even then, consider
ing their birth and education in Christen
dom, we reach those through Christ and '
his teachings, explaining them in the
light of the Hindu philosophy.
Then' we will tell "them tne method by
mean 3of which; they can' : verify these
truths. For religion is a science definite,
exact and experimental. All the truths
of religion can be verified and seen and
known at first hand by any earnest and
qualified seeker by following a definite
method of self-culture, and then he can
say, like : Christ: â "'; "Verity, verily. 1 say
unto thee, we speak that we do know and
teÂ«'i(y that we have seen." -
Yes: a pernon can verify truth by lead
ing the life that Christ led.'*" He can leave
the physical body behind as Christ did
during what fa generally known as the
forty days' and forty nights' last. He can
soar beyond the limitation*" of body and
mind, converse ,' face to lac. v with angels
and archangels, who are realities, and not
myths, as even many Christians fondly
imagine, and .: receive ; instructions from
them, and. then can speak with authority
and certainty.' .'.*â¢ '*-.."". :.â¢--Â£
â Man can be as perfect as his Father in
heaven; otherwise Christ would not
preach it.
- 'This scientific religion, both in theory
aud practice, this sublime self-culture, the
Hindus teach to those who seek i dissatis
fied with a religion that rests only on as
sertion and points always to the other
world for fruition. Â"

McNULTY MAY GO FREE.
Special Prosecutor Kase Ne
glected to Prove the
Venue.
â â  â â  -
Judge Carroll Cook Displeased Because
of a Technical Error in a
Rec nt Trial.
, Another surprise was sprung in the
James McNulty casein Judge Cook's court
yesterday.
McNulty had a fight with C. G. Bennett
at Thorn & McManus* tanyard on the
15th of last February, in which pitchforks
and cleavers were used. In consequence
McNulty was arrested on a charge of as
sault to murder. â  He was held to answer
for assault with a deadly* weapon and
after a hard-fought trial was convicted of
simple assault with a recommendation to
the extreme mercy of the court. . â  ;i- .. -v
"When the defendant was called up to re
ceive his sentence yesterday morning At
torneys T. J: Lennon and Joseph K.
Hawkins objected to further proceedings
on the ground that there was nothing in
the record to show that the alleged offense
was committed in the City and County of
San Francisco..
"What's that?" demanded Judge Cook,
"do you mean to say that the venue was
not proved in this case?" .'
"That is our suggestion," replied Mr.
Lennon. ',â ->.â¢â¢'â¢'.-.
Judge Cook mused for a moment on tbe
uncertainty of .judicial' proceedings: and
then asl.ad for the .official- record. :It
proved to be too voluminous for; peru-al
nl that time and an adj urnnient of the
case was ordered until tiie 29. instant.
j -Bennett,- the man attacked byMcNulty,
was very bitter in his enmity -against 'his
assailant and in order to make' sure of a
conviction, as he thought, hired Lawyer
Thomas Y. Case to act as special couns-1
for the prosecution. This relieved:* the
regal a? pro-.ecu.ing offi-er serving 'in
Judge Cook's court and Mr. X _*-c was per
mitted to conduc: the trial alone.
The defendant and his attorneys assert
that the only proof adduced with regard
to the location of th" figut was that it took
place in Thorn & McManus' tanvard and
that nothing wa** said about that tunyard
being .within " the *_ jurisdiction.'of Judge
Cook'!, court. ', His ._ Honor frowned impa
tiently as he admitted that if such were
the stÂ« ie of the record a new trial would
have to be granted. '.'*
He also gave notice that hereafter tbe
regularly appointed -prosecutine attorney
mmi be .- present during all . trials in i his
department of the Superior Court. With
an i experienced 'â ; prosecutor the establish
ment of the venue is seldom or . never
omitted, Decause it is known, to be a vital
matter. ~ If -; the prosecution fail in-; this
the defendant is entitled to appeal direct
from the judgment without even V going
through the formality of filing -at bill of
exceptions.' -y '"'â  . ;. '.-. **? >^^-_i**S^^?^^^^^Â®
McNulty is feeling considerable satisfac
tion, as there is no longer any probability,
of convicting him of any offense* more

Photograph* by Sugar Light.
A scientist has discovered that light
may be procured from sugar. He has suc
ceeded in taking several photographs by
the light supplied by sugar only. The
sugar was first exposed to a direct sun
light for two hours, and then placed in a
darkroom. Immediately on being placed
in the darkness the sunlight stored in the
sugar began to plow, faintly at first, but
quite ' brightly after a few minutes.
After about twenty * . minutes, during
which. time the photographs were taken,
the light began to die away, and gradu
ally went out. The photographs taken
by sugar light are quite distinct, though
not as clear as an ordinary photograph.
The scientist who made this* discovery de
clares that, by exposing a sack of sugar to
strong sunlight for two hours, enou*h
light could be procured from it to illume a
small house for the same period. .
Women as Sailors.
Norway . and Sweden bear the distinc
tion of being the only nations of the world
in the mercantile marine of which the
women enjoy the same: privileges and
share tbe same perils as the men. Whether
the woman on board is _ the wife of the
captain or of th. commonest sailor, she is
compelled by the Government to do the
work of a man before the mast, and the
women â¢ are even compelled to perform
lookout duty at night. '" ..'. : : :. -

cause of nine -tenths of ; all human sick-

y Despite the protests of the property
i owners, the investigation of the Board of
Supervisors and' the: attention that has
been called to the matter through the
medium' of the public .press, â â¢ Bateman
Bros, still continue their Fabian policy in
their construction of the new Hall of
Justice. . â ..â ..-â â â .*.-*;.* ,
Yesterday only five men were "at work"
on i the site. These were all engaged ". in
digging to reach the bottom of i the . old
cesspool discovered; by the recent excava
tion in the southeast corner of the 'lot.
One of these workmen volunteered the In
formation that they expect to reach hard
soil ; by! next Monday. f; Only "expect"
that is all. ... ' ; . '__. .. *'
Not a bricklayer was in sight. , In fact,
if tbe testimony of reliable residents of
the vicinity is to be taken, not a single
brick has been laid for three days. , ,'.
So far the contractors have given only
the lamest excuses ior their singular
apathy in. the matter. y Their stock in
trade in this line consists "bf ~ two stereo
typed tales of woe. First, they say the
cesspool will have to be entirely cleaned
out' before the foundation of tne south
wall can ',; be "," laid; .â ' second Cohn Bros:
must underpin their building which stands
on the northeast corner of the site. \
The cesspool is "expected" to be cleaned
out .by . Monday ;y and with the same
mournful cadence comes the tale that the
owners of the building in - question are
"expected" *to begin ; the work of under
pinning at ti e same time. The fatuity
these excuses may be seen in the fact that
the .'< cesspool v> could ' , be .' cleaned .; out and
made ready for the ; foundation in two
days by.t wo or three workmen, while Abra-
Lam Cohn stated that be had engaged a
contractor and would begin to, underpin
bis building two weeks ago. ."-:.
Tired of and disgusted at these flimsy
excuses -: certain representatives of . the
North "*â¢ End V- Improvement Association,
namely, President John Shirley, Colonel
George D. Shadburne, W. H. Bod fish and
G.*A:-Berton, went -* before the f: Building
Committee of the Board of Supervisors on
May 12 and made an urgent request that
an end be put to the dilatory methods of
the contractors. The principals, with
Superintendent of Construction Buckley
and Architect Shea, were present also and
many ,. and varied * alleged reasons were
given for tbe inactivity. The result was
that while l seven L men were at work on
Tuesday, May 12,' only five were on band
yesterday. v â 'â ." y y ",â¢,'.'."- "- _,: â â ': â¢â â â

committee of the board will again atteno
the session of the Â£ committee on > next
Tuesday and make a second endeavor to
infuse some life into the project. If they
fail this time, a mass-meeting will be
called, and tne vials of the property
ownera';and residents' wrath will be poured
out on somebody's head. .
,â¢; The cornerstone of the building was laid
in January last. Since that time, to keep
the stone company, a small brict wall has
been laid irregularly around two sides of
the Jot, and three or four holes have been
dug in the earth. One load of cement was
hauled and dumped in the -lot yesterday,
and the day ; before two loads of brick
were brought and cast into the, pile. This
movement obviated all danger of the
hinges on the big gates that lead- into the
lot .rowing rusty from di*?use.
; The most significant fact in connection
with this whole affair is that Superintend

the building committee of the - board,
draws down his $259 :a â  month regularly,
and grows fat in sheer joy tbat he is alive.

Oldest Bank in the World.
Mr. â¢ Neville-Rolf c, British Consul at

the history- and present position of the
Bank of Naples, which is, he says, the
oldest bank iin existence, for the Monte
Vecchio of Venice and the Banco San
Giorgio at Genoa, botn founded in the
twelfth century, have ceased to exist, as
has also the Bank of Barcelona, founded
in the fourteenth century. The Bank of
Naples was founded in 1539, and is a state
bank with a considerable capital to which
no one lays any claim; in other words, it
is a joint stock bank, but with no share
holders.
